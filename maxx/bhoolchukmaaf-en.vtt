00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:19.312 line:80%
Like the dawn on the Ganges shore,

2
00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:23.520 line:80%
A face like flowers drifting evermore.

3
00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:25.395 line:80%
Like a lively street, a city's glow,

4
00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:29.604 line:80%
That’s the splendour you bestow.

5
00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:35.479 line:80%
Yours and mine stars have intertwined.

6
00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:39.479 line:80%
Our stars have aligned, every one of them.

7
00:02:39.562 --> 00:02:41.479 line:80%
Says the lively street and city's glow,

8
00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:45.645 line:80%
That’s the splendour you bestow.

9
00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:50.812 line:80%
I’m lost in your love’s sweet fog,

10
00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:54.770 line:80%
I laugh, I spin, I am a lost cause,

11
00:02:54.854 --> 00:03:01.145 line:80%
I’ve come to this world just to be yours.

12
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.270 line:80%
I've spent countless days without you near,

13
00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:11.270 line:80%
I long to recover all the love lost here,

14
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.145 line:80%
I'm a bit eager to make you mine, dear.

15
00:03:18.562 --> 00:03:23.229 line:80%
I've spent countless days without you near,

16
00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:27.270 line:80%
Fill my silences with your voice so clear.

17
00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:33.645 line:80%
I'm a bit eager to make you mine, dear.

18
00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:37.187 line:80%
Lost in your love’s sunshine and sweet fog,

19
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.145 line:80%
I am a lost cause,

20
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.187 line:80%
Lost in your love’s sunshine and sweet fog,

21
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.229 line:80%
I am losing it all,

22
00:03:43.312 --> 00:03:45.270 line:80%
Lost in your love’s sunshine and sweet fog,

23
00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:48.312 line:80%
I am a lost cause,

24
00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:50.604 line:80%
I am losing it all,

25
00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:55.187 line:80%
I've spent countless days without you near,

26
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.270 line:80%
Fill my silences with your voice so clear.

27
00:03:59.604 --> 00:04:05.312 line:80%
I'm a bit eager to make you mine, dear.

28
00:04:07.062 --> 00:04:14.520 line:80%
I want this desire, this effort, to pay,

29
00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:22.104 line:80%
I long for our hearts to unite,come what may.

30
00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:26.479 line:80%
There should be no distance,no delay in the way.

31
00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:30.562 line:80%
I often yearn and pray,

32
00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:38.979 line:80%
There should be no distance,no delay in the way.

33
00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:43.062 line:80%
The butterfly flew away...

34
00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:44.854 line:80%
The butterfly flew away...

35
00:04:45.854 --> 00:04:47.104 line:80%
The butterfly...

36
00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.312 line:80%
What happened?
Why are you crying?

37
00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:51.354 line:80%
It's not even time
for the post-wedding send-off yet.

38
00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.979 line:80%
I miss Dad.

39
00:04:54.187 --> 00:04:55.979 line:80%
Daddy's little angel,

40
00:04:56.812 --> 00:04:58.437 line:80%
you were with him just two hours ago.

41
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.729 line:80%
How can you already missing him?

42
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.020 line:80%
What if Dad

43
00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.770 line:80%
commits suicide after we run away?

44
00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.354 line:80%
He's not going to do anything like that.

45
00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.729 line:80%
No, no, no.

46
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.104 line:80%
Hey, hey...
Turn the van around.

47
00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:12.937 line:80%
Huh?

48
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.770 line:80%
I'm telling you,
turn the car around.

49
00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.062 line:80%
- Titli...
- Dad!

50
00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:17.187 line:80%
Hey...

51
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.979 line:80%
Titli, listen to me.

52
00:05:20.437 --> 00:05:21.979 line:80%
You were the one who decided you wanted
to run away with me yesterday, right?

53
00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:23.562 line:80%
I was freaking out!

54
00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:24.979 line:80%
But still, here I am,
running away with you.

55
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.145 line:80%
- Hmm.
- I'm not turning the car around.

56
00:05:26.437 --> 00:05:27.604 line:80%
I was the one
who made the decision, right?

57
00:05:27.687 --> 00:05:29.312 line:80%
- Yeah.
- So now I'm making a new one.

58
00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:31.354 line:80%
I'm calling it quits-no more,
we're not running away like before.

59
00:05:31.437 --> 00:05:32.562 line:80%
Turn the car around.

60
00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:35.520 line:80%
Hocus pocus, chaos anew,
If I turn this van, I am a...

61
00:05:37.562 --> 00:05:38.562 line:80%
Titli, I...

62
00:05:38.687 --> 00:05:39.604 line:80%
Titli, just hear me out.

63
00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:40.854 line:80%
If we go back now,

64
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.895 line:80%
my mom's going to seriously kill me
and then pickle me.

65
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.729 line:80%
I stole her van because of you.

66
00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:48.604 line:80%
- I'm not turning around.
- Because of me?

67
00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:49.854 line:80%
- Yeah.
- If you're this scared,

68
00:05:49.937 --> 00:05:51.062 line:80%
why did you even want
to run away with me?

69
00:05:51.312 --> 00:05:52.895 line:80%
You're the one who got me to do this.

70
00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:53.979 line:80%
You suggested it.

71
00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.020 line:80%
I don't care
if you turn the van around or not.

72
00:05:57.062 --> 00:05:57.979 line:80%
I'm leaving.

73
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.645 line:80%
- Hey Titli, Titli, Titli!
- Hey!

74
00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:00.687 line:80%
Titli, listen to me! Titli...

75
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.937 line:80%
- Let me go.
- No, Titli. You're not leaving.

76
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.104 line:80%
Don't make me punch you, Ranjan.
Let me go.

77
00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:05.729 line:80%
Mom is going to kill me,
I'll rather prefer you punch me.

78
00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:06.604 line:80%
Ranjan, let me go.

79
00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.062 line:80%
I've planned everything down
to the last detail, Titli!

80
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.312 line:80%
No, no, take your time,
finish what you're doing.

81
00:06:11.354 --> 00:06:13.312 line:80%
Doing unholy things
in the land of the holy, huh?

82
00:06:15.687 --> 00:06:16.562 line:80%
She's my sister.

83
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.395 line:80%
My sister.

84
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.729 line:80%
The boy's family
is saying the girl ran off with the...

85
00:06:26.812 --> 00:06:28.020 line:80%
What the hell is this?

86
00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:29.604 line:80%
That's exactly
what I've been saying all along.

87
00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.729 line:80%
Forget it. All you've done
is doodle ants on the paper.

88
00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:33.395 line:80%
Let me explain, sir.

89
00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.895 line:80%
No one forced anyone to run away.

90
00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.562 line:80%
We ran away together.

91
00:06:37.687 --> 00:06:38.312 line:80%
Yes.

92
00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:39.645 line:80%
- You two ran away together?
- Yes.

93
00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:40.812 line:80%
Then how did you end up here?

94
00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:42.437 line:80%
Because of him!

95
00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:43.812 line:80%
He dragged us here against our will.

96
00:06:43.895 --> 00:06:45.145 line:80%
I had explained it to him too.
Answer him! Tell him!

97
00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:46.520 line:80%
- Answer him!
- Sir, in a public place, they were...

98
00:06:46.604 --> 00:06:47.604 line:80%
Forget it.
What are you going to say anyway?

99
00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:49.145 line:80%
Just order tea for us. With extra cream.

100
00:06:49.687 --> 00:06:51.854 line:80%
Alright, how old are you?

101
00:06:52.062 --> 00:06:53.020 line:80%
26.

102
00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.770 line:80%
- 25.
- 25.

103
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.979 line:80%
Pick one, 25 or 26?

104
00:06:57.104 --> 00:06:58.104 line:80%
It's 25, sir.

105
00:06:58.187 --> 00:06:59.354 line:80%
- 25?
- It's 25.

106
00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.062 line:80%
It's 25, sir.

107
00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:02.104 line:80%
25, sir.

108
00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:04.020 line:80%
So what do you want to do now?

109
00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:06.854 line:80%
- Sir, we want to go home.
- Sir, we want to get married.

110
00:07:08.604 --> 00:07:09.770 line:80%
We want to get married.

111
00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:11.937 line:80%
Do you want to go home or get married?

112
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.604 line:80%
Because I want to go home too.

113
00:07:13.687 --> 00:07:15.770 line:80%
Sir, we want to go home and get married.

114
00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:18.520 line:80%
No, why, I'll get you married right here.

115
00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:19.645 line:80%
Call the priest.

116
00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.187 line:80%
- At the police station?
- Mr. Pandey...

117
00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:30.270 line:80%
I told you so.

118
00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.520 line:80%
But no one listens to me.

119
00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:38.187 line:80%
Dad?

120
00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:39.354 line:80%
Hmm?

121
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.270 line:80%
Are you pleased now,
after all this slander?

122
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.020 line:80%
The whole of Banaras
is going to look down on us.

123
00:07:45.104 --> 00:07:49.479 line:80%
I told you to be careful,
this girl's character is flawed.

124
00:07:49.562 --> 00:07:51.687 line:80%
- Hear that?!
- Can't you just keep quiet?

125
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.854 line:80%
What did I say wrong?

126
00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:56.979 line:80%
- I say we just get them married.
- Exactly.

127
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.020 line:80%
End of story.

128
00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:00.229 line:80%
Get them married just like that?

129
00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:03.854 line:80%
This way, the matter stays between us
and we won't face any shame.

130
00:08:04.687 --> 00:08:07.062 line:80%
Don't even talk to me about shame,
Tiwari,

131
00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:08.937 line:80%
or I'll start talking.

132
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.687 line:80%
- Hey!
- What are you going to say, huh?

133
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.312 line:80%
I'm trying to protect
your daughter from shame,

134
00:08:13.395 --> 00:08:14.520 line:80%
and you're saying you'll talk?

135
00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:15.812 line:80%
What exactly are you going
to talk about, huh?

136
00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:19.187 line:80%
Everyone in Banaras knows you're living
off your wife's pickle business.

137
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.562 line:80%
Watch your words, Mishra, or I swear...

138
00:08:22.645 --> 00:08:24.020 line:80%
You swear what, huh?

139
00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:25.020 line:80%
What will you do?

140
00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.770 line:80%
Control your daughter.

141
00:08:26.854 --> 00:08:28.187 line:80%
You control your son,

142
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.604 line:80%
he's always messing around.

143
00:08:29.687 --> 00:08:30.895 line:80%
- Let me speak.
- Stay quiet.

144
00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:32.145 line:80%
The officer in charge
has called you all to his cabin.

145
00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:33.604 line:80%
- Okay.
- Let's go.

146
00:08:33.687 --> 00:08:34.770 line:80%
- Come on.
- Let's go.

147
00:08:34.854 --> 00:08:36.229 line:80%
Take them with you too. They will...

148
00:08:36.312 --> 00:08:37.354 line:80%
Don't you dare say a word!

149
00:08:37.437 --> 00:08:39.354 line:80%
So I'm just supposed to stay quiet
no matter what anyone says to me?

150
00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:41.937 line:80%
- You talk without thinking?
- That's not true.

151
00:08:42.145 --> 00:08:43.854 line:80%
So, what do you want to do?
Tell me.

152
00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:46.312 line:80%
What else can we do? It's very simple.
Arrest him.

153
00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:48.062 line:80%
He looks like trouble.

154
00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:50.395 line:80%
Arrest him?!
Why should he arrest him?

155
00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:51.437 line:80%
Our son's trouble,

156
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.562 line:80%
and your daughter
who ran off with him is some angel?

157
00:08:53.687 --> 00:08:55.062 line:80%
This isn't right, Brother.

158
00:08:55.145 --> 00:08:56.770 line:80%
You should show respect,
no matter whose daughter it is.

159
00:08:56.854 --> 00:08:58.979 line:80%
Really? What about when your husband made
fun of me because of her pickle business?

160
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.270 line:80%
- Why bring up the pickles
- Is that a lie?

161
00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:01.562 line:80%
and get yourself slandered again?

162
00:09:01.645 --> 00:09:03.937 line:80%
Mom, Dad... hold on a second.
He wants to say something.

163
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.812 line:80%
Sir.

164
00:09:05.187 --> 00:09:07.020 line:80%
Look, here's my suggestion -

165
00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:08.729 line:80%
Both the girl and the boy are adults.

166
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.520 line:80%
So before they try to run away again,

167
00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:12.687 line:80%
you should just get them married.

168
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.979 line:80%
- That's exactly what I've been saying!
- How can we just get them married?

169
00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:16.645 line:80%
He doesn't even have a job.

170
00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:18.020 line:80%
He's just idling around, sir.

171
00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:18.895 line:80%
An idler?

172
00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:20.645 line:80%
I've filled
out four government job forms, Dad.

173
00:09:20.729 --> 00:09:21.520 line:80%
Yeah.

174
00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:23.187 line:80%
You've been doing that
for the past four years.

175
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.229 line:80%
But nothing has happened, right?

176
00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:26.729 line:80%
Dad, just give him a little more time.

177
00:09:26.812 --> 00:09:29.187 line:80%
Keep quiet or I'll whack you.

178
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.395 line:80%
Hey Mishra, don't you dare touch her!

179
00:09:31.562 --> 00:09:32.937 line:80%
- No, Dad...
- Look at his behavior!

180
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.687 line:80%
You're taking matters into your own
hands right in front of a police officer.

181
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:36.812 line:80%
And you want us to let them get married?

182
00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:39.020 line:80%
- We've got our reputation to think about too.
- Calm down, everyone.

183
00:09:40.354 --> 00:09:41.479 line:80%
Anger won't solve anything.

184
00:09:41.562 --> 00:09:42.812 line:80%
- Yes, that's right.
- Exactly.

185
00:09:42.937 --> 00:09:44.354 line:80%
He needs some more time.
Give it to him.

186
00:09:44.645 --> 00:09:45.562 line:80%
- No.
- Yes.

187
00:09:45.687 --> 00:09:46.687 line:80%
He's right.

188
00:09:46.937 --> 00:09:47.812 line:80%
How is he right?

189
00:09:47.895 --> 00:09:49.645 line:80%
What will you do if she tries
to run away again?

190
00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:51.229 line:80%
- What do you mean, what will I do?
- Where will you go looking for her?

191
00:09:51.562 --> 00:09:52.562 line:80%
Your wife is right.

192
00:09:52.687 --> 00:09:54.770 line:80%
- She's always right.
- Dad...

193
00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.020 line:80%
- Don't cry, don't cry.
- Dad...

194
00:09:57.145 --> 00:09:58.145 line:80%
Titli...

195
00:09:59.812 --> 00:10:00.479 line:80%
Please.

196
00:10:00.562 --> 00:10:01.562 line:80%
Fine.

197
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.645 line:80%
You've got one month
to land a government job,

198
00:10:05.729 --> 00:10:06.604 line:80%
and then Titli will be yours.

199
00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:07.812 line:80%
- We accept this match!
- Hey,

200
00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:09.562 line:80%
let him finish.

201
00:10:10.562 --> 00:10:11.979 line:80%
If you don't do that,

202
00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:15.854 line:80%
and I see you anywhere
within 500 meters of my house,

203
00:10:15.937 --> 00:10:18.062 line:80%
you'll end up in the Ganges.

204
00:10:18.145 --> 00:10:19.145 line:80%
One month is too short,

205
00:10:19.229 --> 00:10:21.979 line:80%
- at least give me two years.
- Two months, Dad.

206
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.895 line:80%
Dad, please, two months.

207
00:10:23.979 --> 00:10:25.854 line:80%
- Two months. Fine, I'll give you two months.
- Fine.

208
00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:26.895 line:80%
What are you doing?

209
00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:27.979 line:80%
I was asking for two years!

210
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.187 line:80%
- Keep quiet.
- You're not listening to me.

211
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.104 line:80%
- I said, keep quiet.
- Keep quiet.

212
00:10:31.187 --> 00:10:33.812 line:80%
Listen, you have two months.

213
00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:35.395 line:80%
It's in your hands now.

214
00:10:36.229 --> 00:10:37.687 line:80%
This isn't fair, sir.

215
00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:39.270 line:80%
It takes more than two months just
to refill a gas cylinder!

216
00:10:39.354 --> 00:10:40.770 line:80%
What can I do in just two months?

217
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.395 line:80%
I don't know about you,
but she can definitely get married.

218
00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:45.354 line:80%
Congratulations on the wedding!

219
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.770 line:80%
- Whatever!
- What are you congratulating him for?

220
00:10:47.854 --> 00:10:48.687 line:80%
Listen to me.

221
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.062 line:80%
- What?
-
The butterfly flew, flew, and flew away.

222
00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:55.020 line:80%
You make tall claims, why...

223
00:10:55.062 --> 00:10:57.895 line:80%
Then blush and sigh.

224
00:10:57.979 --> 00:10:59.854 line:80%
I don't get it,

225
00:11:00.062 --> 00:11:02.020 line:80%
how am I supposed
to get a job that quickly?

226
00:11:02.437 --> 00:11:05.395 line:80%
The easiest job in the world
is having a baby,

227
00:11:05.937 --> 00:11:07.520 line:80%
and even that takes nine months.

228
00:11:07.812 --> 00:11:12.187 line:80%
I've read on WhatsApp about men
getting pregnant in just two months.

229
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.354 line:80%
Kids are being born in labs now,
without even needing parents.

230
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.062 line:80%
Kids are being made
in test tubes these days.

231
00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:19.437 line:80%
- You get my point?
- Test tubes?

232
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.687 line:80%
- How does that even work?
- Shut up, all of you!

233
00:11:22.229 --> 00:11:23.229 line:80%
Enough with all this random talk!

234
00:11:23.979 --> 00:11:25.854 line:80%
Talking about babies for no reason!
I know how to make a baby.

235
00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:28.395 line:80%
We need to focus on my job.

236
00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:30.270 line:80%
That's exactly what we're talking about.

237
00:11:30.354 --> 00:11:32.812 line:80%
Sister-in-law should've asked
for a couple of years.

238
00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:34.937 line:80%
How is this possible
in just two months, Brother?

239
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.895 line:80%
We're not here to turn my problem
into random sentences.

240
00:11:38.895 --> 00:11:41.062 line:80%
Let's focus on how
I'm going to get a job.

241
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.395 line:80%
You can't even land
a private job in two months,

242
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.229 line:80%
- how will you get a government one?
- Right.

243
00:11:47.187 --> 00:11:49.770 line:80%
Uncle, no one would give you
a job even in two lifetimes.

244
00:11:49.937 --> 00:11:50.979 line:80%
So you'd better not comment on this.

245
00:11:53.104 --> 00:11:55.312 line:80%
A government job is like an eagle's pee -

246
00:11:55.812 --> 00:11:56.895 line:80%
both are rare.

247
00:11:56.979 --> 00:12:00.562 line:80%
Forget about eagle pee,
just tell me where the cloves are?

248
00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:04.395 line:80%
Dad, my butt's on the line,
and you're asking about cloves?

249
00:12:04.604 --> 00:12:08.104 line:80%
I need cloves to spice up the dinner,
not your butt.

250
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:12.104 line:80%
Keri, kiddo!

251
00:12:12.687 --> 00:12:15.354 line:80%
Grab me some cloves from downstairs!

252
00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:19.062 line:80%
I can't see the tattoo clearly,
pull it down a little.

253
00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:20.229 line:80%
Keri!

254
00:12:20.312 --> 00:12:22.020 line:80%
Don't you all have any shame?

255
00:12:22.062 --> 00:12:24.145 line:80%
You just got back
from the police station yesterday.

256
00:12:24.229 --> 00:12:27.104 line:80%
Now everyone in the society
is going to think the Tiwaris

257
00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:28.729 line:80%
are shamelessly celebrating.

258
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.812 line:80%
It's Sunday today, society's on holiday.

259
00:12:32.979 --> 00:12:34.395 line:80%
Pull it down a bit.

260
00:12:35.729 --> 00:12:38.145 line:80%
I'm trying to show you my tattoo,
and you're just

261
00:12:38.229 --> 00:12:40.145 line:80%
- showing me your level instead.
- Did you get stuck in there?

262
00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:43.979 line:80%
- What?
- What?

263
00:12:44.354 --> 00:12:45.895 line:80%
You don't even let me take
a dump in peace.

264
00:12:45.979 --> 00:12:47.020 line:80%
Get out of my way.

265
00:12:47.812 --> 00:12:48.979 line:80%
It doesn't even look like you took a dump.

266
00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:51.937 line:80%
Fine,
I'll leave it there tomorrow for you

267
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.020 line:80%
- to see as proof.
- Whatever.

268
00:12:53.062 --> 00:12:54.187 line:80%
Kiddo!

269
00:12:54.687 --> 00:12:57.062 line:80%
Go grab me some cloves from downstairs!

270
00:12:57.145 --> 00:12:58.354 line:80%
Coming!

271
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.312 line:80%
You've got so many people here,

272
00:13:01.395 --> 00:13:02.770 line:80%
why didn't you just ask one
of them to get it?

273
00:13:02.854 --> 00:13:05.020 line:80%
We're having an important meeting, kiddo.

274
00:13:06.979 --> 00:13:08.145 line:80%
What's this meeting about?

275
00:13:09.562 --> 00:13:12.312 line:80%
Your sister-in-law's dad
has set a condition-

276
00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:16.020 line:80%
if your brother doesn't land
a government job within two months,

277
00:13:16.145 --> 00:13:17.604 line:80%
your sister-in-law stays as she is,

278
00:13:17.687 --> 00:13:19.062 line:80%
but your "brother" will have to change.

279
00:13:19.729 --> 00:13:20.729 line:80%
I see.

280
00:13:20.812 --> 00:13:23.562 line:80%
He's not going to get a government job
just sitting at home.

281
00:13:24.145 --> 00:13:25.479 line:80%
Nobody asked for your advice

282
00:13:25.729 --> 00:13:26.645 line:80%
Mind your own business.

283
00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:27.937 line:80%
I'm not giving you any.

284
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.145 line:80%
I don't want it. Buzz off.

285
00:13:30.812 --> 00:13:33.812 line:80%
By the way, I know someone
who might be able to help.

286
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.770 line:80%
But I guess you
don't want my help, right?

287
00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:36.770 line:80%
Fine.

288
00:13:37.145 --> 00:13:38.812 line:80%
Hey Keri, Keri, Keri!

289
00:13:40.145 --> 00:13:43.104 line:80%
My sister is so sweet!

290
00:13:43.187 --> 00:13:44.895 line:80%
Come here, come here, sit with me.

291
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.020 line:80%
You can even sleep in front
of the cooler if you want.

292
00:13:47.395 --> 00:13:49.020 line:80%
Dad, did you make any
kheer
(sweets) for Keri?

293
00:13:49.104 --> 00:13:51.062 line:80%
Yes, I made some.

294
00:13:51.979 --> 00:13:53.145 line:80%
Do you know someone who can help?

295
00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:54.854 line:80%
I'll take you to him tomorrow.

296
00:14:09.979 --> 00:14:11.729 line:80%
I think he stores them here.

297
00:14:11.812 --> 00:14:12.979 line:80%
Just like a monkey.

298
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.020 line:80%
Hmm.

299
00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:16.645 line:80%
Should I order 100-150 more
Kachoris
(snacks) for you?

300
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.187 line:80%
How about some
Jalebis
(sweets)
instead, Brother?

301
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.812 line:80%
Will you keep eating
or actually say something?

302
00:14:21.395 --> 00:14:23.145 line:80%
How is this possible in just two months?

303
00:14:24.187 --> 00:14:25.604 line:80%
I told you,

304
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.812 line:80%
even the easiest job
in the world takes nine months.

305
00:14:28.312 --> 00:14:30.229 line:80%
I wasted so much time because of you!

306
00:14:30.562 --> 00:14:32.770 line:80%
Listen, you're going to pay
for all the
Kachoris
.

307
00:14:32.854 --> 00:14:33.562 line:80%
Hey, make sure he pays for everything!

308
00:14:33.687 --> 00:14:34.895 line:80%
Where are you going? Stop.

309
00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:36.145 line:80%
I'm so going to whack you.

310
00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:38.229 line:80%
I've already wasted
so much time because of you.

311
00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:39.979 line:80%
Out of the two months I have,
I've already lost two days.

312
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.062 line:80%
You spent them drinking beer!

313
00:14:42.145 --> 00:14:43.020 line:80%
Who do you think you are?

314
00:14:43.062 --> 00:14:44.562 line:80%
You can't do anything by yourself.

315
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.979 line:80%
I got your Aadhar card made.
I got you your passport.

316
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.729 line:80%
- And I'm the one who convinced Titli to...
- Hey,

317
00:14:48.812 --> 00:14:49.979 line:80%
don't bring Titli into this!
I'm warning you.

318
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.020 line:80%
Titli won't be able to do anything either,

319
00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:52.229 line:80%
her father will just send her away.

320
00:14:52.312 --> 00:14:53.020 line:80%
- Got it?
- Keri, I swear,

321
00:14:53.104 --> 00:14:55.104 line:80%
I'll stuff you inside a
samosa
wrapper
and fry you up!

322
00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:56.312 line:80%
Go ahead! I dare you to do it right now!

323
00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:57.895 line:80%
Why should I? I'm not the cook here!

324
00:14:57.979 --> 00:14:59.895 line:80%
- And the whole of Banaras knows...
- Calm down, both of you!

325
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.562 line:80%
- Stop fighting.
- Yes.

326
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.645 line:80%
He's trying to say something.
Let's hear him out.

327
00:15:04.562 --> 00:15:05.729 line:80%
There's one option.

328
00:15:06.729 --> 00:15:07.437 line:80%
What?

329
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.270 line:80%
Bhagwan
. (God)

330
00:15:08.562 --> 00:15:09.645 line:80%
- Damn it.
- Huh?

331
00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:10.937 line:80%
Bhagwan!

332
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.062 line:80%
Great choice!
Come here, you...

333
00:15:13.395 --> 00:15:16.062 line:80%
We've already handed over
his fate in God's hands.

334
00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:18.020 line:80%
No, I'm not talking about God,

335
00:15:18.354 --> 00:15:19.854 line:80%
I'm talking about Bhagwan Das.

336
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.687 line:80%
Who's this Bhagwan Das?

337
00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:24.062 line:80%
I'll take you to him.

338
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.979 line:80%
Here it is. Stop, stop, stop!

339
00:15:28.437 --> 00:15:29.687 line:80%
We've arrived! We're here!

340
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:30.812 line:80%
Let's go. Take this.

341
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.645 line:80%
Alright?

342
00:15:31.729 --> 00:15:32.645 line:80%
Yeah? Go.

343
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.479 line:80%
This one.

344
00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:36.354 line:80%
It's an amazing place.
Let's go, sir.

345
00:15:36.437 --> 00:15:38.020 line:80%
- Come on, Your Highness.
- What is this place?

346
00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.354 line:80%
Just follow me.
It's a one-stop shop for all your needs.

347
00:15:40.645 --> 00:15:41.770 line:80%
Follow me.

348
00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:44.979 line:80%
We're here.

349
00:15:47.687 --> 00:15:48.979 line:80%
Greetings, Guruji.

350
00:15:49.395 --> 00:15:51.104 line:80%
- Greetings, Guruji.
- Bless you.

351
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.895 line:80%
I don't know Kathak,

352
00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:55.937 line:80%
but if there's a government job
in breakdancing,

353
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.854 line:80%
- I'm your guy.
- He's not our guy, Bhagwan is upstairs.

354
00:15:57.937 --> 00:15:59.187 line:80%
- Let's go.
- Come on, man...

355
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.437 line:80%
It's okay, you can go ahead.

356
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.395 line:80%
Kathak Guruji!

357
00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:03.187 line:80%
- Indian culture!
- It's alright.

358
00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:07.020 line:80%
I also wanted to learn,
but my waist doesn't agree.

359
00:16:13.645 --> 00:16:14.812 line:80%
Damn it, it's dead.

360
00:16:15.395 --> 00:16:16.395 line:80%
Who's dead?

361
00:16:16.937 --> 00:16:18.437 line:80%
The snake.

362
00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.562 line:80%
What am I supposed to do now?

363
00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:22.270 line:80%
Look Brother,

364
00:16:23.687 --> 00:16:25.604 line:80%
the list of the final 15 candidates

365
00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:28.937 line:80%
for the irrigation department
is right here.

366
00:16:31.104 --> 00:16:34.062 line:80%
And about the other forms you filled...

367
00:16:35.312 --> 00:16:37.520 line:80%
None of their results
are coming out this year.

368
00:16:38.145 --> 00:16:40.895 line:80%
- Oh no!
- Guruji, he won't be able to get married.

369
00:16:41.354 --> 00:16:42.645 line:80%
His love life is at stake here, you see.

370
00:16:42.729 --> 00:16:45.020 line:80%
Why do you bring matters
involving love to me?

371
00:16:45.062 --> 00:16:46.770 line:80%
Can't you see I'm busy here?

372
00:16:46.854 --> 00:16:48.854 line:80%
I'll have to make some effort
for this, Brother.

373
00:16:48.937 --> 00:16:50.979 line:80%
Please, Guruji, help me out here.

374
00:16:51.395 --> 00:16:53.687 line:80%
I really love her a lot.
You can ask anyone, they'll tell you.

375
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.937 line:80%
- Go ahead, tell him.
- Yeah, they're seriously in love.

376
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.979 line:80%
- Just like Laila and Majnu.
- They're crazy about each other.

377
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.645 line:80%
Brother, he actually landed
a government job!

378
00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.937 line:80%
Thank you, Guruji!

379
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.020 line:80%
Everyone, say it together:

380
00:17:03.104 --> 00:17:04.729 line:80%
Har Har Mahadev!
(Everyone is an embodiment of Lord Shiva)

381
00:17:04.812 --> 00:17:07.062 line:80%
- Har Har Mahadev!- Har Har Mahadev!

382
00:17:07.229 --> 00:17:08.687 line:80%
Guruji, can I tell you something?

383
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.354 line:80%
Not just in name, Guruji,

384
00:17:10.479 --> 00:17:12.395 line:80%
- you're actually like god to me.
- He's right, Guruji.

385
00:17:12.562 --> 00:17:13.979 line:80%
That's fine.

386
00:17:14.854 --> 00:17:16.687 line:80%
Rs. 600,000 upfront before you join.

387
00:17:17.104 --> 00:17:19.020 line:80%
Wait, I get Rs. 600,000 before joining?

388
00:17:19.062 --> 00:17:20.062 line:80%
Guruji!

389
00:17:20.145 --> 00:17:23.729 line:80%
- Guruji, you're not just a god, you're...
- Silly...

390
00:17:24.104 --> 00:17:26.104 line:80%
You won't get it, you have to pay up.

391
00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.229 line:80%
- I have to pay?
- Yes, you do.

392
00:17:28.312 --> 00:17:29.687 line:80%
A Rs. 200,000 advance.

393
00:17:30.229 --> 00:17:32.645 line:80%
Rs. 200,000 in advance?

394
00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:33.395 line:80%
Yes.

395
00:17:33.479 --> 00:17:35.020 line:80%
I'm giving you this price
since you came with him.

396
00:17:35.062 --> 00:17:36.104 line:80%
He's practically family.

397
00:17:36.187 --> 00:17:38.145 line:80%
Right, Pramod?
Wait, your name's Pramod, right?

398
00:17:38.229 --> 00:17:40.437 line:80%
No, my name's Sushil.

399
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.395 line:80%
Anyway, I quoted that price
since he's practically family.

400
00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:46.937 line:80%
Otherwise, I never charge less than
Rs. 1 million, no matter what.

401
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.145 line:80%
Yeah, he's right.

402
00:17:48.437 --> 00:17:49.687 line:80%
So...?

403
00:17:50.354 --> 00:17:51.687 line:80%
Guys...

404
00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.812 line:80%
Okay... Rs. 200,000 it is.

405
00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:55.937 line:80%
How are we okay with Rs. 200,000?

406
00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.312 line:80%
How are you going
to come up with Rs. 200,000?

407
00:17:57.395 --> 00:17:59.729 line:80%
Guruji, how am I supposed
to pay Rs. 200,000?

408
00:17:59.937 --> 00:18:01.770 line:80%
Don't expect
Bhagwan
(god)
to solve everything,

409
00:18:01.854 --> 00:18:03.645 line:80%
sometimes you've got to do it yourself.

410
00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:05.645 line:80%
Work hard, you're still young.

411
00:18:05.812 --> 00:18:07.020 line:80%
Find a way to get it.

412
00:18:07.229 --> 00:18:10.104 line:80%
Otherwise, you can join
this coaching class for Rs. 600 a month.

413
00:18:10.437 --> 00:18:11.770 line:80%
You'll study here for 4-6 years,

414
00:18:11.854 --> 00:18:14.020 line:80%
then by year 7 or 8,
I can get you a peon's job.

415
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.395 line:80%
A peon?

416
00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:17.229 line:80%
No, Guruji, I don't want to be a peon!

417
00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:18.395 line:80%
You...

418
00:18:18.479 --> 00:18:19.729 line:80%
Why don't you...

419
00:18:20.895 --> 00:18:22.979 line:80%
You stall this irrigation department list.

420
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.604 line:80%
I'll figure out how to get the money.

421
00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:25.395 line:80%
Okay.

422
00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:27.229 line:80%
You can keep the peon job for me.

423
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.979 line:80%
Sure, you look like one anyway.

424
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.020 line:80%
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:18:30.312 --> 00:18:32.270 line:80%
You seriously want to be a peon?

426
00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.729 line:80%
I just can't stand being single anymore,
Nephew.

427
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.645 line:80%
Okay, Guruji.

428
00:18:39.729 --> 00:18:42.104 line:80%
Stall this list for me,
I'll figure out the money.

429
00:18:42.562 --> 00:18:44.437 line:80%
- Stall this list for me.
- Yes, Rs. 200,000 in advance.

430
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.770 line:80%
-
Har Har Mahadev!
- Okay, Brother.

431
00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:47.020 line:80%
- Guruji, take care of me too.
- See you, take care.

432
00:18:47.062 --> 00:18:48.354 line:80%
I work for Mr. Gupta.

433
00:18:48.437 --> 00:18:51.520 line:80%
- Yeah, I got it, you work for Mr. Gupta.
-
The butterfly flew, flew, and flew away.

434
00:18:51.687 --> 00:18:55.729 line:80%
You make tall claims, why...

435
00:18:55.812 --> 00:18:59.395 line:80%
Then blush and sigh.

436
00:19:00.895 --> 00:19:02.020 line:80%
Tittu,

437
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.562 line:80%
you're not thinking about running
away anymore, are you?

438
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:06.770 line:80%
Why do you ask?

439
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.937 line:80%
Just thinking, what will we do
if I don't get a job in two months?

440
00:19:10.437 --> 00:19:12.729 line:80%
You and your negativity!

441
00:19:13.395 --> 00:19:15.104 line:80%
What's the problem
with getting a job now?

442
00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:16.687 line:80%
Bhagwan's helping you with that, right?

443
00:19:16.854 --> 00:19:20.062 line:80%
Yeah, but he wants Rs. 600,000
before I join,

444
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.270 line:80%
and Rs. 200,000 advance.

445
00:19:22.437 --> 00:19:24.854 line:80%
I'll get you that as dowry.

446
00:19:25.312 --> 00:19:27.062 line:80%
My dad won't send me off empty-handed.

447
00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:29.937 line:80%
Titli, I'm totally against dowry.

448
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.270 line:80%
Never, no, never.

449
00:19:31.854 --> 00:19:33.020 line:80%
- Hmm?
- Yes.

450
00:19:34.104 --> 00:19:35.854 line:80%
You can keep whatever
he gives you out of love,

451
00:19:35.937 --> 00:19:37.020 line:80%
but I won't touch it.

452
00:19:37.062 --> 00:19:38.812 line:80%
Then we'll use it.

453
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.437 line:80%
And what about the Rs. 200,000 advance?

454
00:19:43.729 --> 00:19:46.020 line:80%
Look, the thing is, I didn't adopt...

455
00:19:46.104 --> 00:19:47.312 line:80%
- Who?
- You.

456
00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.312 line:80%
Will you do anything on your own, Ranjan?

457
00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:52.312 line:80%
Titli, the problem is you only
asked your dad for two months.

458
00:19:52.687 --> 00:19:54.770 line:80%
- I'm trying, and on top of that...
- What are you even trying, huh?

459
00:19:54.854 --> 00:19:56.645 line:80%
I'm trying...

460
00:19:58.937 --> 00:20:02.020 line:80%
You keep trying,
and I'll end up married to someone else.

461
00:20:02.354 --> 00:20:03.812 line:80%
This is Banaras!

462
00:20:04.229 --> 00:20:06.437 line:80%
I'll tear apart anyone
who even looks at you!

463
00:20:06.812 --> 00:20:08.229 line:80%
My name is Ranjan after all!

464
00:20:10.437 --> 00:20:12.270 line:80%
You're just good
at spitting out such dialogues.

465
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.562 line:80%
If you can't get it, just borrow it.

466
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.104 line:80%
My dad's almost broke
covering your expenses.

467
00:20:23.979 --> 00:20:25.729 line:80%
- Do you think this is funny?
- No, I'm not laughing.

468
00:20:27.104 --> 00:20:28.729 line:80%
You just show up and say,

469
00:20:28.854 --> 00:20:31.854 line:80%
"Babu wants Rs. 500,
Babu Rs. 1000," like it's nothing.

470
00:20:31.937 --> 00:20:34.354 line:80%
And somehow,
this Babu's Baby always gets the cash!

471
00:20:34.437 --> 00:20:37.395 line:80%
Titli, I could borrow money
in a heartbeat,

472
00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:39.145 line:80%
but no one lends me anything.

473
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.687 line:80%
So, who am I supposed to borrow it from?

474
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.395 line:80%
I'm going to whack you!

475
00:20:43.437 --> 00:20:44.812 line:80%
- Hey!
- You...

476
00:20:44.895 --> 00:20:46.104 line:80%
I'm praising you.

477
00:20:46.354 --> 00:20:47.687 line:80%
Are you going to swim
to the shore or what?

478
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.895 line:80%
Hold up until we get to the riverbank.

479
00:20:49.645 --> 00:20:50.437 line:80%
Where will I go anyway?

480
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.020 line:80%
Looks like I'm stuck with you.

481
00:20:52.979 --> 00:20:54.854 line:80%
We're meant to be together forever.

482
00:21:02.062 --> 00:21:03.895 line:80%
- Pundit-ji!
Har Har Mahadev!
-
Mahadev!

483
00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:06.020 line:80%
Hey Bullet Train, can you at least tell me
where we're headed?

484
00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:11.854 line:80%
Are you planning to get off anytime soon?

485
00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:13.395 line:80%
Yeah.

486
00:21:19.687 --> 00:21:20.520 line:80%
What's this?

487
00:21:20.729 --> 00:21:22.229 line:80%
A necklace, around 40 grams.

488
00:21:22.312 --> 00:21:23.187 line:80%
Huh?

489
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.104 line:80%
Have you lost it?

490
00:21:26.187 --> 00:21:27.229 line:80%
How much is it worth?

491
00:21:27.604 --> 00:21:29.020 line:80%
No, I mean, whose is it?

492
00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:30.645 line:80%
It's my mom's.

493
00:21:30.937 --> 00:21:32.770 line:80%
I was going to get it when I got married.

494
00:21:32.895 --> 00:21:34.479 line:80%
But that can only happen
if I get married, right?

495
00:21:34.562 --> 00:21:36.770 line:80%
Have you lost it?

496
00:21:37.604 --> 00:21:38.437 line:80%
If your family finds out,

497
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.062 line:80%
our wedding could be called
off even before it happens.

498
00:21:40.479 --> 00:21:42.062 line:80%
Why don't you do this

499
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.729 line:80%
bring your mom's necklace instead?

500
00:21:43.812 --> 00:21:46.270 line:80%
- Okay?
- No, I can't bring my mom's necklace.

501
00:21:46.354 --> 00:21:47.687 line:80%
How can I sell it?

502
00:21:47.937 --> 00:21:49.270 line:80%
You know how my mom is -

503
00:21:49.645 --> 00:21:52.062 line:80%
she'll thrash me, and my little dad too.

504
00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:53.145 line:80%
Nah, not my mom's.

505
00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.020 line:80%
Who's asking you to sell it?

506
00:21:55.187 --> 00:21:56.354 line:80%
I'm only asking you to mortgage it.

507
00:21:56.437 --> 00:21:57.937 line:80%
We'll get it back once we have the money.

508
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.270 line:80%
- Oh, you want to mortgage it?
- Yes.

509
00:22:00.479 --> 00:22:02.020 line:80%
Then you can use your mom's.

510
00:22:03.187 --> 00:22:04.645 line:80%
It's kind of the same thing, right?

511
00:22:05.395 --> 00:22:07.729 line:80%
I swear, sometimes it feels like

512
00:22:07.812 --> 00:22:09.645 line:80%
I'm the only one serious
about getting married.

513
00:22:09.729 --> 00:22:11.354 line:80%
You'll just come for the food
at the wedding.

514
00:22:11.437 --> 00:22:12.229 line:80%
Hey!

515
00:22:15.604 --> 00:22:16.687 line:80%
Uncle...

516
00:22:18.229 --> 00:22:19.645 line:80%
Please take a look at this necklace.

517
00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:26.020 line:80%
I don't need to check,

518
00:22:26.187 --> 00:22:27.645 line:80%
it came from my shop.

519
00:22:29.437 --> 00:22:31.020 line:80%
- Sonu,
- Yes?

520
00:22:31.312 --> 00:22:33.395 line:80%
- you changed the hook last month, right?
- Yes.

521
00:22:33.479 --> 00:22:35.104 line:80%
Yeah, I remember-

522
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.687 line:80%
his necklace was for Mr. Mishra
from Pandeypur, right?

523
00:22:38.354 --> 00:22:39.812 line:80%
No, it's Mr. Sharma's.

524
00:22:41.604 --> 00:22:43.687 line:80%
Yes, I'm Mr. Mishra's daughter.

525
00:22:43.854 --> 00:22:45.104 line:80%
- I see!
- Yes.

526
00:22:45.645 --> 00:22:47.270 line:80%
He told me about your wedding.

527
00:22:47.729 --> 00:22:48.979 line:80%
He has picked two sets
of necklaces for you.

528
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.395 line:80%
- Would you like me to show them to you?
- I know,

529
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.395 line:80%
I'll check them out later.
Please...

530
00:22:53.187 --> 00:22:54.104 line:80%
What do you want to do with it?

531
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.312 line:80%
I want to mortgage it.

532
00:22:59.437 --> 00:23:00.437 line:80%
What happened?

533
00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:01.937 line:80%
Is everything alright at home?

534
00:23:04.812 --> 00:23:07.104 line:80%
Everything's fine for now.

535
00:23:07.979 --> 00:23:11.020 line:80%
This is Ranjan Tiwari,
the person I'm going to marry.

536
00:23:11.229 --> 00:23:12.062 line:80%
Hello.

537
00:23:12.145 --> 00:23:16.020 line:80%
But if you tell my family about this

538
00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:17.979 line:80%
or refuse to take the necklace,

539
00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:20.062 line:80%
the wedding will be called off.

540
00:23:20.229 --> 00:23:22.020 line:80%
And if the wedding's off,

541
00:23:22.062 --> 00:23:25.104 line:80%
my dad won't need
to order those two sets.

542
00:23:25.812 --> 00:23:27.770 line:80%
I hope you understand, Uncle?

543
00:23:30.687 --> 00:23:31.687 line:80%
How much do you want?

544
00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:37.770 line:80%
We bought it for around Rs. 350,000.

545
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.687 line:80%
Uncle, we'll settle for Rs. 200,000.

546
00:23:45.395 --> 00:23:46.395 line:80%
Thank you.

547
00:23:46.854 --> 00:23:47.979 line:80%
Goodbye, Uncle.

548
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.187 line:80%
Thank you, Uncle.

549
00:23:49.729 --> 00:23:51.395 line:80%
I'll send you an invite.
Please come to the wedding.

550
00:23:51.729 --> 00:23:52.937 line:80%
Brother Sonu, you too.

551
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.979 line:80%
No one's touched my heart this way,

552
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.979 line:80%
You are my only fate.

553
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.854 line:80%
With you, I'll linger like a thought.

554
00:24:10.937 --> 00:24:13.645 line:80%
That's the only thing I know.

555
00:24:13.729 --> 00:24:16.437 line:80%
The mirror calls you pretty.

556
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.229 line:80%
Remains engrossed in your beauty

557
00:24:19.437 --> 00:24:22.020 line:80%
Tell him to quit teasing me,

558
00:24:22.104 --> 00:24:24.895 line:80%
Or from you, I will steal it.

559
00:24:24.979 --> 00:24:27.604 line:80%
Hear your praise from me,

560
00:24:27.687 --> 00:24:30.520 line:80%
together we're destined to be.

561
00:24:30.687 --> 00:24:33.437 line:80%
The world where we will belong,

562
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.937 line:80%
Our wedding date is not too long

563
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:42.979 line:80%
Like the kohl that graces my eyes,

564
00:24:45.854 --> 00:24:48.395 line:80%
and dreams infinite.

565
00:24:48.645 --> 00:24:49.937 line:80%
I'll hold you close,

566
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.020 line:80%
Far from the world's prying eyes

567
00:24:54.104 --> 00:24:58.645 line:80%
Not in secret, I will love you...by choice

568
00:24:58.812 --> 00:25:01.437 line:80%
No one's touched my heart this way,

569
00:25:01.729 --> 00:25:04.437 line:80%
You are my only fate.

570
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.354 line:80%
With you, I'll linger like a thought.

571
00:25:07.437 --> 00:25:09.895 line:80%
That's the only thing I know.

572
00:25:09.979 --> 00:25:12.937 line:80%
When you've got love, you can't be poor

573
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.604 line:80%
No one is weirder than a lover

574
00:25:15.854 --> 00:25:18.604 line:80%
When eyes meet,it feels like life's on the line,

575
00:25:18.687 --> 00:25:21.687 line:80%
Love is holier than the cross-divine

576
00:25:26.812 --> 00:25:29.729 line:80%
Steal me away my love

577
00:25:29.812 --> 00:25:32.562 line:80%
To you, I have dedicated my youth

578
00:25:32.645 --> 00:25:35.312 line:80%
I'm going to pressmy lips against yours and check

579
00:25:35.479 --> 00:25:38.145 line:80%
Wondering where you're sweet,where you're ablaze.

580
00:25:38.229 --> 00:25:41.020 line:80%
You're like the flame floating on water

581
00:25:41.104 --> 00:25:43.979 line:80%
Like an orchardof roses that fills the air

582
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.770 line:80%
My eyes cool down when they see you,

583
00:25:46.854 --> 00:25:49.520 line:80%
But your touch ignites a fire

584
00:25:49.604 --> 00:25:52.312 line:80%
No one's touched my heart this way,

585
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.187 line:80%
You are my only fate.

586
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.104 line:80%
With you, I'll linger like a thought.

587
00:25:58.187 --> 00:26:00.895 line:80%
That's the only thing I know.

588
00:26:01.729 --> 00:26:05.354 line:80%
I have madly fallen for you, my love

589
00:26:05.437 --> 00:26:07.437 line:80%
Do you know

590
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.979 line:80%
Overwhelmed with your love

591
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.520 line:80%
Do you know

592
00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.979 line:80%
Can't stop chasing you around

593
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.812 line:80%
Without drinking, I sway and dance,

594
00:26:17.937 --> 00:26:20.562 line:80%
I kiss even the shadow of your glance.

595
00:26:20.645 --> 00:26:21.479 line:80%
My life, my love,

596
00:26:21.562 --> 00:26:23.437 line:80%
I offer it all to you,my heart's true chance.

597
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.062 line:80%
No one's touched my heart this way,

598
00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:29.104 line:80%
You are my only fate.

599
00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:32.312 line:80%
-
With you, I'll linger like a thought.
- Ranjan, listen...

600
00:26:32.395 --> 00:26:34.479 line:80%
-
That's the only thing I know.
- Come a little closer. - Ranjan...

601
00:26:34.562 --> 00:26:35.687 line:80%
I love you.

602
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:36.937 line:80%
Hey!

603
00:26:38.979 --> 00:26:40.229 line:80%
That was a close one!

604
00:26:40.645 --> 00:26:41.687 line:80%
Wake up!

605
00:26:46.937 --> 00:26:48.020 line:80%
Damn it!

606
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.104 line:80%
Ranjan, here's the thing...

607
00:26:51.104 --> 00:26:52.020 line:80%
What's going on?

608
00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.229 line:80%
Have some water first.

609
00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:56.020 line:80%
No, get me some tea.

610
00:26:56.395 --> 00:26:59.104 line:80%
Where are you going, huh?
To get tea, seriously?

611
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:00.854 line:80%
You tell him.

612
00:27:00.937 --> 00:27:02.312 line:80%
I, well...

613
00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:04.270 line:80%
Uncle, why don't you explain it to him?

614
00:27:04.979 --> 00:27:06.062 line:80%
You tell him.

615
00:27:06.354 --> 00:27:07.187 line:80%
You're older than me, Uncle.

616
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.020 line:80%
I'll slap you, just tell me already!

617
00:27:09.937 --> 00:27:11.895 line:80%
Bhagwan took your money
and ran away, Brother!

618
00:27:13.937 --> 00:27:14.979 line:80%
Bhag...

619
00:27:15.604 --> 00:27:16.604 line:80%
Bhagwan did what?

620
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.937 line:80%
Bhagwan stole your money and ran away!

621
00:27:21.812 --> 00:27:23.062 line:80%
His office has been shut
for the last three days.

622
00:27:23.145 --> 00:27:25.104 line:80%
I've asked everyone around here.

623
00:27:25.354 --> 00:27:26.729 line:80%
Nobody knows anything.

624
00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:28.937 line:80%
But we're looking for him.

625
00:27:33.895 --> 00:27:37.020 line:80%
Oh no, my...
My slippers!

626
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.979 line:80%
- Hey, listen to me.
- Brother...

627
00:27:39.062 --> 00:27:41.020 line:80%
I've sent my men to look for him.
Just hear me out.

628
00:27:41.104 --> 00:27:42.979 line:80%
Titli's going to kill me!

629
00:27:59.104 --> 00:28:00.520 line:80%
BHAGWAN DAS!!!

630
00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:02.062 line:80%
We're on the terrace,

631
00:28:02.145 --> 00:28:03.562 line:80%
and no one's around.

632
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:04.979 line:80%
Bhagwan Das!

633
00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:09.895 line:80%
Hey...

634
00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:11.187 line:80%
I couldn't find anything.

635
00:28:11.312 --> 00:28:12.229 line:80%
- Did you check the place properly?
- Yeah.

636
00:28:12.312 --> 00:28:14.270 line:80%
Master-ji,
Bhagwan Das used to live upstairs.

637
00:28:14.354 --> 00:28:15.437 line:80%
- Have you seen him?
- No, Brother, I have no idea

638
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.437 line:80%
where Bhagwan Das is.
Please leave.

639
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.979 line:80%
His life's falling apart
and you're here doing Kathak.

640
00:28:20.062 --> 00:28:20.854 line:80%
Come on, let's go.

641
00:28:20.937 --> 00:28:22.854 line:80%
You can't go picking fights
with everyone, Uncle.

642
00:28:27.437 --> 00:28:29.104 line:80%
Only I know how I got those Rs. 200,000.

643
00:28:32.854 --> 00:28:37.104 line:80%
I have my men looking for him.

644
00:28:37.687 --> 00:28:39.104 line:80%
- We'll find him.
- Yes, Brother.

645
00:28:43.104 --> 00:28:45.145 line:80%
You've put my mom's necklace on mortgage.

646
00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:51.312 line:80%
Did you talk to Sushil?

647
00:28:55.104 --> 00:28:56.187 line:80%
He doesn't know either.

648
00:28:57.437 --> 00:28:59.604 line:80%
So, we've lost the money,

649
00:29:00.687 --> 00:29:01.937 line:80%
the job,

650
00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:05.020 line:80%
and my mom's necklace.

651
00:29:12.895 --> 00:29:13.937 line:80%
Great.

652
00:29:15.104 --> 00:29:16.979 line:80%
You don't have any time left.

653
00:29:18.854 --> 00:29:20.729 line:80%
And you don't want to run away
and get married.

654
00:29:26.645 --> 00:29:27.604 line:80%
Okay,

655
00:29:29.062 --> 00:29:30.145 line:80%
I'll get going then.

656
00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:33.562 line:80%
I'll send you an invite to my wedding.

657
00:29:35.562 --> 00:29:37.145 line:80%
Please come, alright?

658
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.729 line:80%
Don't be sad, Nephew.

659
00:30:04.062 --> 00:30:06.979 line:80%
I think we should do
what Lord Krishna had done.

660
00:30:07.729 --> 00:30:09.270 line:80%
Let's kidnap Titli.

661
00:30:09.812 --> 00:30:12.020 line:80%
Uncle, I'll drown you in that cup of tea!

662
00:30:12.104 --> 00:30:13.145 line:80%
Be quiet.

663
00:30:15.395 --> 00:30:16.812 line:80%
I asked for
Kachoris
,

664
00:30:16.895 --> 00:30:18.229 line:80%
and you're giving me
Ladoos
(sweets)?

665
00:30:18.645 --> 00:30:19.854 line:80%
It's a holy offering, Brother.

666
00:30:19.937 --> 00:30:21.104 line:80%
I'll get you your
Kachoris
in a bit.

667
00:30:21.187 --> 00:30:22.729 line:80%
- Take this.
- Okay, fine.

668
00:30:24.062 --> 00:30:25.979 line:80%
Why are you handing these out, Brother?

669
00:30:26.604 --> 00:30:30.687 line:80%
I pledged to Mahadev that
if my daughter-in-law gets pregnant,

670
00:30:30.937 --> 00:30:32.687 line:80%
I'll shave my head.

671
00:30:33.645 --> 00:30:35.937 line:80%
How will Mahadev help with that, Shukla?

672
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.562 line:80%
Take your son to a good doctor instead.

673
00:30:38.645 --> 00:30:39.645 line:80%
He's such a dolt.

674
00:30:39.729 --> 00:30:41.562 line:80%
He's shown him to everyone, Brother.

675
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:43.520 line:80%
The doctor can't do anything more now.

676
00:30:43.729 --> 00:30:46.979 line:80%
He'll only have a child
if Mahadev blesses him.

677
00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:48.854 line:80%
I see.

678
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.312 line:80%
Brother, why don't you make a pledge, huh?

679
00:30:54.604 --> 00:30:55.979 line:80%
Who knows, it might work for you too.

680
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.770 line:80%
- What do you say, Uncle?
- Yeah, why not?

681
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.812 line:80%
I've tried trusting one Bhagwan before.

682
00:31:01.145 --> 00:31:02.312 line:80%
I can't do it again.

683
00:31:02.687 --> 00:31:06.020 line:80%
What's the point of sitting like this
and giving up, Nephew?

684
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.604 line:80%
Give it a try.

685
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.854 line:80%
Uncle, I don't want to try.

686
00:31:10.062 --> 00:31:11.104 line:80%
You try it.

687
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.687 line:80%
What's the harm in trying once, huh?

688
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:14.937 line:80%
Try it.

689
00:31:15.854 --> 00:31:17.687 line:80%
Do you have money to pay the bill?
He's gone.

690
00:31:17.979 --> 00:31:19.270 line:80%
You don't have any?

691
00:31:22.812 --> 00:31:23.979 line:80%
Glory to Lord Shiva!

692
00:31:24.187 --> 00:31:26.979 line:80%
Praise be to the consort
of Goddess Parvati!

693
00:31:27.062 --> 00:31:31.020 line:80%
Har Har Mahadev!

694
00:31:32.562 --> 00:31:33.770 line:80%
Dear Mahadev,

695
00:31:33.854 --> 00:31:35.645 line:80%
please grant me a government job quickly.

696
00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:37.937 line:80%
I pledge I'll shave my head...

697
00:31:38.604 --> 00:31:40.895 line:80%
No, if I shave my head,
everyone will think my dad's dead.

698
00:31:41.145 --> 00:31:42.645 line:80%
No, I can't shave my head.

699
00:31:43.145 --> 00:31:45.604 line:80%
Dear Mahadev,
please give me a government job quickly.

700
00:31:45.687 --> 00:31:48.270 line:80%
I pledge I'll fast for 16 Mondays...

701
00:31:48.895 --> 00:31:50.812 line:80%
Girls do that to find a good husband.

702
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.104 line:80%
And I'm going to be a good husband,
Mahadev.

703
00:31:53.354 --> 00:31:55.562 line:80%
What should I say?
Mahadev, Mahadev...

704
00:31:55.854 --> 00:31:57.729 line:80%
Dear Mahadev,
please give me a government job quickly.

705
00:31:57.812 --> 00:32:01.145 line:80%
I pledge to remain celibate for life.

706
00:32:01.895 --> 00:32:02.854 line:80%
Celibate?

707
00:32:03.062 --> 00:32:04.979 line:80%
I want the job so I can get married!

708
00:32:05.229 --> 00:32:07.270 line:80%
Are you making a vow
or playing KBC with God?

709
00:32:07.354 --> 00:32:08.979 line:80%
Can't you see there's
a long line behind you?

710
00:32:09.062 --> 00:32:10.854 line:80%
Give me just two minutes, Brother.

711
00:32:11.187 --> 00:32:12.562 line:80%
He wants two minutes!

712
00:32:12.937 --> 00:32:14.854 line:80%
Mahadev, I'll be right back, okay?

713
00:32:15.645 --> 00:32:17.687 line:80%
- Go, take His blessings.
- Get out of my way.

714
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.520 line:80%
Pundit-ji, I seek your blessings.

715
00:32:23.645 --> 00:32:24.645 line:80%
Mahadev!

716
00:32:25.854 --> 00:32:28.020 line:80%
Pundit-ji, I wanted to ask you something.

717
00:32:29.229 --> 00:32:32.604 line:80%
What pledge should I make
to ensure God answers my wish?

718
00:32:34.812 --> 00:32:36.062 line:80%
Why are you laughing?

719
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.312 line:80%
My life's a mess.

720
00:32:38.979 --> 00:32:42.187 line:80%
What can you give God
when you're here asking for help?

721
00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:47.854 line:80%
But I've heard that God doesn't
listen unless you offer something.

722
00:32:47.979 --> 00:32:49.145 line:80%
Do you think

723
00:32:49.979 --> 00:32:54.187 line:80%
God will listen faster
if you offer something?

724
00:32:54.937 --> 00:32:57.562 line:80%
So, what should I do to make
God answer my prayers, Pundit-ji?

725
00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.979 line:80%
Give Rs. 101.

726
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:01.937 line:80%
He'll fulfill it for just Rs. 101?

727
00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:02.895 line:80%
Mahadev!

728
00:33:02.979 --> 00:33:05.062 line:80%
That's my fee, son.

729
00:33:06.354 --> 00:33:07.562 line:80%
Oh, for you.

730
00:33:10.229 --> 00:33:11.104 line:80%
Keep it here.

731
00:33:14.145 --> 00:33:15.937 line:80%
I'll pay you Re. 1 through UPI.

732
00:33:16.479 --> 00:33:17.604 line:80%
Please, tell me.

733
00:33:18.395 --> 00:33:20.937 line:80%
Son, go outside, get some milk,

734
00:33:21.937 --> 00:33:25.604 line:80%
offer it to Mahadev with a clean heart

735
00:33:26.062 --> 00:33:29.979 line:80%
and pledge that if He fulfills your wish,

736
00:33:30.062 --> 00:33:31.979 line:80%
you'll do a good deed.

737
00:33:32.812 --> 00:33:33.895 line:80%
- That's it?
- Yes.

738
00:33:33.979 --> 00:33:35.104 line:80%
- Just offer Him milk?
- Yes.

739
00:33:36.354 --> 00:33:37.770 line:80%
- Goodbye, Pundit-ji.
- Stay happy.

740
00:33:37.895 --> 00:33:41.270 line:80%
Pundit-ji, whose milk should
I offer-cow, buffalo, or goat?

741
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.729 line:80%
Cow.

742
00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:43.812 line:80%
Cow's milk.

743
00:33:43.895 --> 00:33:44.979 line:80%
Goodbye, Pundit-ji.

744
00:33:49.812 --> 00:33:50.979 line:80%
Work faster.

745
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.270 line:80%
We've got a huge order.

746
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.520 line:80%
Oh no, Shahida,

747
00:33:56.604 --> 00:33:59.520 line:80%
you're cutting them
too big-make them smaller.

748
00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:00.645 line:80%
Will this size work?

749
00:34:00.729 --> 00:34:03.854 line:80%
No, smaller than that.
You're not understanding.

750
00:34:03.979 --> 00:34:04.687 line:80%
Cut them smaller.

751
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.854 line:80%
She wants us to smash them?

752
00:34:05.937 --> 00:34:08.604 line:80%
They just don't get it.
Should I crush them?

753
00:34:09.479 --> 00:34:10.937 line:80%
Come on, son,

754
00:34:10.979 --> 00:34:13.187 line:80%
- why the long face?
- Take it off.

755
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.187 line:80%
You'll find another job.

756
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.770 line:80%
And another girl too.

757
00:34:18.604 --> 00:34:19.520 line:80%
Yes.

758
00:34:19.604 --> 00:34:20.687 line:80%
Come on.

759
00:34:35.979 --> 00:34:37.937 line:80%
Look at this pickle, for example.

760
00:34:38.354 --> 00:34:40.062 line:80%
It takes a lot of effort.

761
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.979 line:80%
We cut them, dry them,

762
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.187 line:80%
oil them, rub spices on them,
pack them in a jar.

763
00:34:45.979 --> 00:34:48.020 line:80%
But one drop of water,

764
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.645 line:80%
and it's ruined.

765
00:34:51.437 --> 00:34:54.020 line:80%
But that doesn't mean
we stop making pickles.

766
00:34:54.687 --> 00:34:56.562 line:80%
I've built a huge business out of this.

767
00:34:58.937 --> 00:35:00.937 line:80%
Life's the same.

768
00:35:02.562 --> 00:35:04.562 line:80%
Some things work out, others don't.

769
00:35:04.729 --> 00:35:05.604 line:80%
Got it?

770
00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:08.604 line:80%
But that doesn't mean you stop living.

771
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.145 line:80%
Just stay away from water drops, like him.

772
00:35:13.812 --> 00:35:16.104 line:80%
Always doing these breathing exercises.

773
00:35:16.729 --> 00:35:17.562 line:80%
Answer it.

774
00:35:17.645 --> 00:35:19.645 line:80%
Your pain in the neck
phone's ringing, answer it.

775
00:35:20.895 --> 00:35:21.770 line:80%
Let it ring.

776
00:35:21.854 --> 00:35:24.520 line:80%
If you don't want to answer,
just disconnect it.

777
00:35:25.604 --> 00:35:26.770 line:80%
What are you staring at?

778
00:35:26.937 --> 00:35:28.604 line:80%
What did I tell you?

779
00:35:29.312 --> 00:35:31.187 line:80%
What did I tell you?
Look, you need to do it like this.

780
00:35:31.854 --> 00:35:33.270 line:80%
Breathe in from the right.

781
00:35:33.354 --> 00:35:34.145 line:80%
Hello?

782
00:35:34.854 --> 00:35:35.854 line:80%
Where are you?

783
00:35:36.104 --> 00:35:37.729 line:80%
I've been trying to reach you.

784
00:35:37.895 --> 00:35:39.062 line:80%
Life's been trying me too.

785
00:35:39.354 --> 00:35:40.187 line:80%
Who is this?

786
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.104 line:80%
It's me, Bhagwan.
Have you forgotten me already?

787
00:35:43.062 --> 00:35:44.312 line:80%
You...

788
00:35:44.604 --> 00:35:45.937 line:80%
You're a demon!

789
00:35:46.312 --> 00:35:47.979 line:80%
I'm going to kill you!
Where the hell are you?

790
00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.937 line:80%
This is great, son.
You want to kill me after

791
00:35:49.979 --> 00:35:51.770 line:80%
I went all the way to Lucknow for you?

792
00:35:52.229 --> 00:35:54.020 line:80%
It was tough, but I handled it.

793
00:35:55.645 --> 00:35:56.479 line:80%
Handled it?

794
00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:59.854 line:80%
I mean, your government job's confirmed.

795
00:35:59.937 --> 00:36:01.354 line:80%
Do you even check your emails?

796
00:36:01.854 --> 00:36:02.729 line:80%
Huh?

797
00:36:02.812 --> 00:36:05.312 line:80%
Stop all this and arrange
Rs. 600,000, understood?

798
00:36:05.604 --> 00:36:06.687 line:80%
Hang up now.

799
00:36:06.979 --> 00:36:07.937 line:80%
Hello?

800
00:36:09.979 --> 00:36:10.979 line:80%
What happened?

801
00:36:12.979 --> 00:36:14.729 line:80%
Well, I...

802
00:36:16.229 --> 00:36:17.687 line:80%
I got a government job.

803
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:18.729 line:80%
Huh?

804
00:36:18.937 --> 00:36:19.937 line:80%
Nonsense!

805
00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:23.354 line:80%
- I got a job, Dad!
- Get off me.

806
00:36:23.437 --> 00:36:25.937 line:80%
Mom, I got a government job!

807
00:36:28.812 --> 00:36:30.854 line:80%
- Sister-in-law, you're not eating.
- Try these.

808
00:36:30.937 --> 00:36:32.229 line:80%
Have some
Ladoos
.

809
00:36:32.895 --> 00:36:33.979 line:80%
Have it.

810
00:36:36.812 --> 00:36:41.937 line:80%
Brother, why don't my son
and your daughter talk privately?

811
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.020 line:80%
- Sure, why not?
- Go, Titli, show Chunne your room.

812
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.229 line:80%
I'm not showing
that buffoon my room, okay?

813
00:36:50.312 --> 00:36:51.854 line:80%
He's a good guy.

814
00:36:51.937 --> 00:36:53.187 line:80%
She's just a little shy.

815
00:36:53.895 --> 00:36:54.895 line:80%
Her nature shows it -

816
00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.770 line:80%
- she's quiet and calm.
- Yes, she is.

817
00:36:56.854 --> 00:36:58.979 line:80%
It's a blessing from God,
we feel really blessed.

818
00:36:59.062 --> 00:37:00.020 line:80%
Move!

819
00:37:00.354 --> 00:37:04.437 line:80%
I was wondering
what's been vibrating under me.

820
00:37:05.145 --> 00:37:07.020 line:80%
- That's Titli's phone.
- Go get it.

821
00:37:07.104 --> 00:37:10.104 line:80%
Okay.
Someone named Babu is calling.

822
00:37:10.187 --> 00:37:13.812 line:80%
She's Titli's childhood friend.

823
00:37:13.895 --> 00:37:14.854 line:80%
Babli.

824
00:37:14.937 --> 00:37:15.937 line:80%
I see.

825
00:37:16.145 --> 00:37:17.854 line:80%
- Yes.
- I thought...

826
00:37:18.229 --> 00:37:21.520 line:80%
- No, it's not like that.
- Pundit-ji, set the wedding date.

827
00:37:21.854 --> 00:37:22.937 line:80%
Why are you calling?

828
00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:23.937 line:80%
A prospective groom's family
is here to meet her.

829
00:37:23.979 --> 00:37:24.687 line:80%
Hang up the phone.

830
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.604 line:80%
Sister, start the wedding preparations.

831
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.270 line:80%
Tell Titli and her dad
I got a government job.

832
00:37:30.687 --> 00:37:31.562 line:80%
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

833
00:37:31.645 --> 00:37:32.979 line:80%
Give me a moment, I'll tell her.

834
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.020 line:80%
- I'll give you the opportunity to...
- Titli!

835
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.854 line:80%
Ranjan got the job.

836
00:37:37.937 --> 00:37:38.645 line:80%
What?!

837
00:37:39.187 --> 00:37:40.604 line:80%
Let me talk to him.

838
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.020 line:80%
- What happened?
- Yes, Babu...

839
00:37:42.104 --> 00:37:43.229 line:80%
- Nothing.
- What's going on?

840
00:37:43.312 --> 00:37:44.770 line:80%
- I'll tell him...
- Brother, hurry up.

841
00:37:44.854 --> 00:37:45.979 line:80%
Why don't you just start dwelling
in my ears, huh!

842
00:37:46.062 --> 00:37:47.229 line:80%
I'm working on it.

843
00:37:47.729 --> 00:37:49.104 line:80%
- Dad!
- What?

844
00:37:49.437 --> 00:37:52.020 line:80%
Ranjan got a government job!

845
00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:54.937 line:80%
Who's Ranjan?

846
00:37:55.937 --> 00:37:56.937 line:80%
No.

847
00:37:57.604 --> 00:37:59.020 line:80%
We can't do anything now.

848
00:37:59.645 --> 00:38:00.895 line:80%
His time is up.

849
00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:03.187 line:80%
You'll marry Chunne.

850
00:38:03.479 --> 00:38:05.562 line:80%
My name is Anoop.

851
00:38:05.645 --> 00:38:07.020 line:80%
Yes, Anoop Chunne.

852
00:38:09.187 --> 00:38:12.937 line:80%
So things got delayed by a few days.
What's the big deal, Dad?

853
00:38:13.062 --> 00:38:14.104 line:80%
What, Dad, huh?

854
00:38:14.437 --> 00:38:16.604 line:80%
I'm not going to marry
this laughing stock!

855
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:21.145 line:80%
Mr. Mishra, your daughter
is calling my son a laughing stock!

856
00:38:21.562 --> 00:38:22.895 line:80%
- This isn't right.
- No, I...

857
00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:23.979 line:80%
Listen to me...

858
00:38:25.062 --> 00:38:26.937 line:80%
What's not right, Uncle?

859
00:38:27.895 --> 00:38:30.687 line:80%
Be thankful we didn't get married.

860
00:38:30.979 --> 00:38:35.937 line:80%
Otherwise, I'd make your life
and your son's life a living hell!

861
00:38:36.145 --> 00:38:37.562 line:80%
Got it?

862
00:38:37.895 --> 00:38:38.729 line:80%
And yours too.

863
00:38:38.812 --> 00:38:39.770 line:80%
Mr. Mishra...

864
00:38:40.354 --> 00:38:41.645 line:80%
Why are you misbehaving?

865
00:38:42.937 --> 00:38:44.770 line:80%
I'm not misbehaving...

866
00:38:44.979 --> 00:38:47.229 line:80%
You set the condition, didn't you?

867
00:38:47.479 --> 00:38:48.854 line:80%
But his time's up.

868
00:38:48.937 --> 00:38:52.020 line:80%
- His time's up.
- Listen, just drop it and agree.

869
00:38:52.354 --> 00:38:53.979 line:80%
He got the job.

870
00:38:54.437 --> 00:38:55.604 line:80%
So my word doesn't matter?

871
00:38:55.687 --> 00:38:56.854 line:80%
And what about our dignity?

872
00:38:57.229 --> 00:38:59.562 line:80%
Dad...
Mom, I'm going to get ready.

873
00:38:59.645 --> 00:39:00.770 line:80%
Here, enjoy.

874
00:39:00.854 --> 00:39:02.354 line:80%
- Listen...
- Sister, let's go.

875
00:39:02.437 --> 00:39:03.187 line:80%
Titli!

876
00:39:03.354 --> 00:39:04.729 line:80%
- You'll regret this.
- Please, listen...

877
00:39:04.812 --> 00:39:06.520 line:80%
- Please hear me out.
- No. Come on, let's go.

878
00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.770 line:80%
What's going on? Go find out.

879
00:39:13.645 --> 00:39:14.854 line:80%
Get out of my way.

880
00:39:17.479 --> 00:39:19.604 line:80%
Sister-in-law, how are you?

881
00:39:19.687 --> 00:39:20.979 line:80%
- Congratulations,
- I'm fine.

882
00:39:21.062 --> 00:39:23.062 line:80%
- congratulations.
- You didn't have to bring all this.

883
00:39:23.145 --> 00:39:25.979 line:80%
- I really don't believe it...
- You go!

884
00:39:26.229 --> 00:39:27.979 line:80%
Our surprise is ruined.

885
00:39:28.062 --> 00:39:29.979 line:80%
- They already know!
- Here, take this.

886
00:39:30.479 --> 00:39:32.520 line:80%
Here, Brother, enjoy some sweets.

887
00:39:32.604 --> 00:39:33.854 line:80%
What's the occasion?

888
00:39:33.937 --> 00:39:35.104 line:80%
The wedding, of course.

889
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.812 line:80%
It's not fixed yet.

890
00:39:36.895 --> 00:39:38.854 line:80%
It was fixed two months ago.

891
00:39:38.937 --> 00:39:40.312 line:80%
He just got the job.

892
00:39:40.854 --> 00:39:43.187 line:80%
Son, go seek her dad's blessings.

893
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.645 line:80%
- Dad!
- No, no need.

894
00:39:44.729 --> 00:39:46.187 line:80%
He doesn't need to touch my feet.

895
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:47.520 line:80%
Come here, son.
You can seek my blessings.

896
00:39:47.604 --> 00:39:48.604 line:80%
Mom...

897
00:39:48.687 --> 00:39:49.895 line:80%
This isn't right.

898
00:39:50.229 --> 00:39:50.979 line:80%
Let's go.

899
00:39:51.062 --> 00:39:53.562 line:80%
Just wait and see the electricity bill
you get this month.

900
00:39:53.645 --> 00:39:54.395 line:80%
Have it, have it.

901
00:39:54.479 --> 00:39:55.645 line:80%
- Chunne.
- Let's go.

902
00:39:55.979 --> 00:39:57.104 line:80%
Sir, I'll take my leave now.

903
00:39:57.187 --> 00:39:59.895 line:80%
Pundit-ji, which electricity bill
are you going to pay?

904
00:39:59.979 --> 00:40:00.979 line:80%
Please have a seat.

905
00:40:01.062 --> 00:40:03.270 line:80%
Shall we set the wedding date?

906
00:40:03.354 --> 00:40:05.562 line:80%
Yes, of course.
Yes, now you have to.

907
00:40:05.645 --> 00:40:07.104 line:80%
Damn it.

908
00:40:08.437 --> 00:40:10.520 line:80%
Listen, what color
lehenga
(dress)
should I wear?

909
00:40:10.604 --> 00:40:11.562 line:80%
I could go for a pink one.

910
00:40:11.687 --> 00:40:12.687 line:80%
No one listens to me.

911
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:14.229 line:80%
Listen, should I wear
a multi-colored
lehenga
?

912
00:40:14.312 --> 00:40:15.854 line:80%
- Whatever you like.
- You're going to regret this.

913
00:40:15.937 --> 00:40:17.187 line:80%
You should wear a blue sherwani.

914
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:18.020 line:80%
- Whatever you want.
- I'm thinking...

915
00:40:18.104 --> 00:40:19.104 line:80%
Will the priest just read the charts,

916
00:40:19.187 --> 00:40:20.270 line:80%
- The previous guy was better.
- or will he actually say something?

917
00:40:20.354 --> 00:40:22.062 line:80%
- I'm so excited!
- Ask him.

918
00:40:22.729 --> 00:40:26.229 line:80%
Priest, can you tell
us the auspicious date?

919
00:40:28.895 --> 00:40:30.895 line:80%
- Damn it.
- That's quite auspicious!

920
00:40:30.979 --> 00:40:33.562 line:80%
Sir, I've tried everything,

921
00:40:33.812 --> 00:40:35.312 line:80%
but I can't find
an auspicious date for your son.

922
00:40:35.479 --> 00:40:36.979 line:80%
You can't find any? How is that possible?

923
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.729 line:80%
I suggest the 30th of this month.

924
00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:39.729 line:80%
Otherwise,

925
00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:41.354 line:80%
you'll have to wait until
next year's October.

926
00:40:41.437 --> 00:40:42.062 line:80%
Awesome!

927
00:40:42.145 --> 00:40:44.229 line:80%
- 30th is perfect! Final!
- How is it perfect?

928
00:40:45.812 --> 00:40:47.854 line:80%
- It's already the 12th.
- There he goes again.

929
00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:50.687 line:80%
Dad, there's so much
to do for a girl's wedding.

930
00:40:50.937 --> 00:40:52.979 line:80%
You need to talk to the caterer,
book a hall,

931
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.604 line:80%
print invites, and distribute them.

932
00:40:54.854 --> 00:40:56.604 line:80%
He can't just casually
throw out "30th is perfect."

933
00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:57.520 line:80%
Oh, really?

934
00:40:57.604 --> 00:40:58.229 line:80%
Alright, 30th is perfect...

935
00:40:58.312 --> 00:40:59.979 line:80%
and now I've said it with
my head hung in shame. Happy?

936
00:41:00.937 --> 00:41:02.604 line:80%
Dad, let's do it next year.

937
00:41:02.687 --> 00:41:05.187 line:80%
How can you say next year, huh?

938
00:41:05.687 --> 00:41:07.770 line:80%
Brother-in-law, we'll handle everything.

939
00:41:07.854 --> 00:41:10.854 line:80%
We'll talk to the caterers, book the hall,

940
00:41:10.979 --> 00:41:14.104 line:80%
and I'll personally
go get the invites printed. Got it?

941
00:41:14.187 --> 00:41:16.937 line:80%
And if it's too much trouble,
you can skip the wedding.

942
00:41:16.979 --> 00:41:18.187 line:80%
- Yes, you can.
- That'll save Dad

943
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:20.270 line:80%
the cost of one extra plate.
Right? Right, Mom?

944
00:41:20.354 --> 00:41:21.729 line:80%
What are you saying?
He is your brother-in-law!

945
00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:23.604 line:80%
Sister, I'm staying quiet because of you.

946
00:41:23.687 --> 00:41:24.895 line:80%
Did you hear that, Dad?

947
00:41:25.854 --> 00:41:27.312 line:80%
Who do I listen to, huh?

948
00:41:28.395 --> 00:41:30.437 line:80%
- Dad!
- Everyone just keeps saying "Dad!"

949
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.687 line:80%
Dad, we'll handle everything.

950
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.812 line:80%
Please, finalize it.

951
00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:36.687 line:80%
What difference does it make,
this year or next?

952
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.104 line:80%
If we want to get them married,
let's do it on the 30th itself.

953
00:41:39.437 --> 00:41:40.104 line:80%
Yes!

954
00:41:40.187 --> 00:41:42.854 line:80%
Now that's more like it, Sister-in-law!

955
00:41:42.937 --> 00:41:45.645 line:80%
Thank you, Lord!

956
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.687 line:80%
I'll arrive in a carwith flowers all around,

957
00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:01.520 line:80%
Dressed as a groom,I'll sweep you off the ground.

958
00:42:08.854 --> 00:42:11.020 line:80%
This is the hot topic at my aunt's place,

959
00:42:11.104 --> 00:42:12.895 line:80%
What a beautiful sight it is,

960
00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:15.854 line:80%
With your fresh perspective in grace.

961
00:42:16.145 --> 00:42:18.437 line:80%
No one has doubts anymore,

962
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.062 line:80%
Let the music flow,

963
00:42:20.145 --> 00:42:23.145 line:80%
I'm thirsty,and you're my river, you know.

964
00:42:23.354 --> 00:42:25.687 line:80%
The entire area will dance with flair,

965
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.520 line:80%

I'm like a blazing fire,

971
00:42:48.604 --> 00:42:51.812 line:80%
Admiration rains down, lifting me higher.

972
00:42:51.895 --> 00:42:52.395 line:80%
Bounce.

973
00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:55.854 line:80%
We gaze at each other, finding peace,

974
00:42:55.937 --> 00:42:59.562 line:80%
Leave your home and dwellin my house, please.

975
00:43:07.062 --> 00:43:13.937 line:80%
Everything we dreamedor imagined will now come true,

976
00:43:14.354 --> 00:43:20.979 line:80%
Our union is one that's like no other,so pure and new.

977
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.729 line:80%
Let's shed the pain,the illness, and all my fears,

978
00:43:24.812 --> 00:43:31.895 line:80%
Let's rejoice and celebrate,for my time has shifted, my dear.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.020 line:80%
My love, I now belong to you for life.

987
00:44:01.104 --> 00:44:05.687 line:80%
I shine like a bright light,a silver knife,

988
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.854 line:80%
My love, I now belong to you for life.

989
00:44:19.979 --> 00:44:21.937 line:80%
We've only got tonight.

990
00:44:22.604 --> 00:44:24.270 line:80%
Why? What happens tomorrow?

991
00:44:24.979 --> 00:44:26.062 line:80%
Hey!

992
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.104 line:80%
Tomorrow, you'll be my wife.

993
00:44:32.062 --> 00:44:34.770 line:80%
So, this is the last night
I'll be spending with my girlfriend.

994
00:44:34.979 --> 00:44:36.354 line:80%
Amazing!

995
00:44:36.895 --> 00:44:39.145 line:80%
Your inner romantic Shah Rukh Khan
is really showing today.

996
00:44:39.229 --> 00:44:40.979 line:80%
- Really?
- Yes.

997
00:44:43.062 --> 00:44:44.937 line:80%
- This... Like this?
- Yes.

998
00:44:48.104 --> 00:44:49.187 line:80%
Can I say something, Titli?

999
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:50.062 line:80%
Hmm.

1000
00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.229 line:80%
The thrill of meeting secretly...

1001
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.645 line:80%
we won't get to enjoy it anymore.

1002
00:44:56.354 --> 00:44:58.812 line:80%
But why secretly?

1003
00:45:00.145 --> 00:45:02.312 line:80%
You can meet me freely tomorrow,
after we're married.

1004
00:45:03.145 --> 00:45:04.145 line:80%
Hey...

1005
00:45:04.354 --> 00:45:05.937 line:80%
You're not getting it.

1006
00:45:08.812 --> 00:45:11.854 line:80%
Fear makes love so much more fun.

1007
00:45:13.854 --> 00:45:14.979 line:80%
Hand me my glass.

1008
00:45:15.854 --> 00:45:17.104 line:80%
- Hand you your glass.
- Yes.

1009
00:45:19.604 --> 00:45:20.854 line:80%
Here you go.

1010
00:45:24.562 --> 00:45:26.270 line:80%
Stop. Slow down.

1011
00:45:30.937 --> 00:45:32.062 line:80%
A wedge of lemon.

1012
00:45:37.312 --> 00:45:38.604 line:80%
Can I say something, Titli?

1013
00:45:38.895 --> 00:45:40.437 line:80%
You should stay the same even
after we get married -

1014
00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.562 line:80%
just as crazy.

1015
00:45:43.187 --> 00:45:44.604 line:80%
Don't change at all.

1016
00:45:45.312 --> 00:45:46.229 line:80%
Okay?

1017
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.479 line:80%
Why would I change, huh?

1018
00:45:50.104 --> 00:45:51.895 line:80%
Speak for yourself, Ranjan Tiwari.

1019
00:45:51.979 --> 00:45:53.812 line:80%
Boys change after marriage.

1020
00:45:53.895 --> 00:45:55.145 line:80%
And if you do,

1021
00:45:55.229 --> 00:45:57.520 line:80%
I'll separate your skin from your bones.
Got it?

1022
00:45:57.812 --> 00:45:58.979 line:80%
Titli!

1023
00:46:00.354 --> 00:46:01.354 line:80%
I...

1024
00:46:01.729 --> 00:46:04.229 line:80%
I'm trying to be all romantic with you,

1025
00:46:04.312 --> 00:46:06.312 line:80%
and you're pulling me apart?

1026
00:46:07.395 --> 00:46:09.145 line:80%
This is what I don't like about you.

1027
00:46:09.437 --> 00:46:10.645 line:80%
You need to work on this.

1028
00:46:11.145 --> 00:46:12.229 line:80%
Do some homework.

1029
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:17.479 line:80%
But you just said I don't need to change.

1030
00:46:19.562 --> 00:46:20.979 line:80%
- I said that?
- Yes.

1031
00:46:22.937 --> 00:46:25.979 line:80%
Yes, but a little
change never hurt anyone.

1032
00:46:28.312 --> 00:46:30.729 line:80%
Change is the only constant in life.

1033
00:46:31.812 --> 00:46:33.729 line:80%
What other rules are there, Ranjan?

1034
00:46:34.729 --> 00:46:37.104 line:80%
I was born to break the rules.

1035
00:46:37.812 --> 00:46:38.895 line:80%
Right?

1036
00:46:40.395 --> 00:46:42.687 line:80%
Hey, what are you doing?
What if someone sees us together?

1037
00:46:42.895 --> 00:46:43.687 line:80%
So what?

1038
00:46:44.104 --> 00:46:45.395 line:80%
I'm this family's son-in-law!

1039
00:46:45.479 --> 00:46:46.937 line:80%
You're not yet.

1040
00:46:47.729 --> 00:46:48.937 line:80%
Then make me.

1041
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.895 line:80%
- Please, make me.
- No.

1042
00:46:51.979 --> 00:46:53.645 line:80%
- Please, make me.
- You'll mess up the henna.

1043
00:46:53.729 --> 00:46:55.604 line:80%
Please don't do this. Ranjan!

1044
00:46:56.604 --> 00:46:59.395 line:80%
- How can you ask for such an outrageous fare?
- Hurry up, bring the ladders too.

1045
00:46:59.479 --> 00:47:00.687 line:80%
I seek your blessing, Aunty.

1046
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.479 line:80%
See you tonight, Mrs. Ranjan.

1047
00:47:23.812 --> 00:47:26.020 line:80%
Come on, Mr. Groom, let's go!

1048
00:47:26.229 --> 00:47:28.020 line:80%
Keep this box over there.

1049
00:47:28.104 --> 00:47:30.062 line:80%
Where are you heading?
Where are you going, huh?

1050
00:47:30.145 --> 00:47:32.145 line:80%
Why are you carrying it over your head?

1051
00:47:32.229 --> 00:47:34.187 line:80%
Put the ladder on this side.

1052
00:47:35.604 --> 00:47:37.145 line:80%
Ma'am, where do you want me
to put this box of oil?

1053
00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:38.229 line:80%
Why don't you put it on my head?

1054
00:47:38.312 --> 00:47:39.895 line:80%
Obviously, you'll put it in the kitchen!

1055
00:47:40.604 --> 00:47:41.979 line:80%
- Do you have anything else left in the tempo?
- Yeah, yeah.

1056
00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.145 line:80%
Then go get it.

1057
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:54.854 line:80%
Brother!

1058
00:47:56.812 --> 00:47:57.770 line:80%
Try this on.

1059
00:47:58.229 --> 00:47:59.645 line:80%
It looks great.

1060
00:47:59.729 --> 00:48:01.145 line:80%
Why do you keep making
me try it every day?

1061
00:48:01.229 --> 00:48:03.562 line:80%
I want it to fit perfectly.

1062
00:48:04.145 --> 00:48:05.520 line:80%
You look awesome.

1063
00:48:05.604 --> 00:48:06.979 line:80%
Why don't you get it?

1064
00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.854 line:80%
Are you a men's tailor
or a women's tailor?

1065
00:48:08.937 --> 00:48:09.895 line:80%
What is this?

1066
00:48:10.395 --> 00:48:12.270 line:80%
I think the shoulders are a little loose.

1067
00:48:12.395 --> 00:48:13.687 line:80%
I'll fix it by tomorrow.

1068
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:15.062 line:80%
That's what you said yesterday!

1069
00:48:15.437 --> 00:48:16.645 line:80%
I'm getting married today!

1070
00:48:16.812 --> 00:48:18.395 line:80%
You want me to wear this
on my honeymoon tomorrow?

1071
00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:20.229 line:80%
I was told the wedding is on the 30th.

1072
00:48:20.312 --> 00:48:22.854 line:80%
- Really? So what's today?
- You look like a clown.

1073
00:48:22.937 --> 00:48:24.395 line:80%
Huh? How dare you!

1074
00:48:24.854 --> 00:48:26.187 line:80%
She's talking to me, not you.

1075
00:48:26.312 --> 00:48:28.187 line:80%
Well, then she's right.

1076
00:48:29.187 --> 00:48:31.562 line:80%
This is the result of your
Banaras's number one tailor.

1077
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.770 line:80%
He told me he's the number one tailor.

1078
00:48:33.854 --> 00:48:36.145 line:80%
My shop's called "number one," Uncle.

1079
00:48:36.395 --> 00:48:38.437 line:80%
Both you and your shop can go to hell.

1080
00:48:38.812 --> 00:48:40.645 line:80%
If I can't get on my wedding horse
because of you,

1081
00:48:40.729 --> 00:48:42.145 line:80%
I'll make the horse get on you.

1082
00:48:42.229 --> 00:48:43.354 line:80%
Remember that...

1083
00:48:44.104 --> 00:48:45.020 line:80%
Sorry, Brother.

1084
00:48:45.104 --> 00:48:46.895 line:80%
Everyone seems want a piece of me today!

1085
00:48:46.979 --> 00:48:48.145 line:80%
- I have no respect here.
- Sorry.

1086
00:48:48.229 --> 00:48:50.020 line:80%
Mix some more of this, will you?

1087
00:48:50.104 --> 00:48:51.270 line:80%
- This won't be enough.
- Okay, fine.

1088
00:48:51.354 --> 00:48:52.937 line:80%
You're at it again?

1089
00:48:53.145 --> 00:48:55.104 line:80%
It's the turmeric ceremony day!

1090
00:48:55.187 --> 00:48:57.604 line:80%
We're going to apply turmeric on you.

1091
00:48:57.895 --> 00:48:59.979 line:80%
But we already did the turmeric thing.
What, now you want to marinate me?

1092
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.979 line:80%
Brother-in-law, the chicken will get nice

1093
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.479 line:80%
- Where's his kurta? Get it!
- and juicy only after it marinates, right?

1094
00:49:03.604 --> 00:49:05.145 line:80%
Come on, have a seat. Come on.

1095
00:49:05.229 --> 00:49:06.895 line:80%
Have some shame, Sister-in-law.

1096
00:49:07.145 --> 00:49:09.187 line:80%
Mom, we don't have time for this,
the wedding's in 8 hours. Let's go.

1097
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:10.354 line:80%
Huh?
The wedding?

1098
00:49:10.437 --> 00:49:11.229 line:80%
Yeah.

1099
00:49:11.562 --> 00:49:13.145 line:80%
- What's today's date?
- 29th, Aunty.

1100
00:49:13.229 --> 00:49:15.479 line:80%
Today's the 29th, the wedding's tomorrow.

1101
00:49:15.687 --> 00:49:17.937 line:80%
Are you high on bhaang?
Today's the 30th!

1102
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.562 line:80%
I'll whack you right now!

1103
00:49:20.645 --> 00:49:22.104 line:80%
Today's the 29th, tomorrow's the 30th!

1104
00:49:22.187 --> 00:49:24.354 line:80%
Mom, Mom, Mom, today's the 30th!

1105
00:49:24.437 --> 00:49:27.895 line:80%
Look at that, my son's going nuts.

1106
00:49:27.979 --> 00:49:29.645 line:80%
Today's the 29th, son.

1107
00:49:30.062 --> 00:49:31.020 line:80%
Today's...

1108
00:49:31.187 --> 00:49:34.770 line:80%
Looks like he's too excited
for the wedding.

1109
00:49:34.854 --> 00:49:36.312 line:80%
- Give it here. Just give it to me.
- Looks like he's lost his mind

1110
00:49:36.395 --> 00:49:37.979 line:80%
over the wedding excitement.

1111
00:49:38.812 --> 00:49:39.895 line:80%
Today's the 29th, right?

1112
00:49:39.979 --> 00:49:42.979 line:80%
- Why did you stop? Keep playing it.
- Mom, I'm done, come clean me up.

1113
00:49:49.562 --> 00:49:51.104 line:80%
Take it from there.

1114
00:49:51.187 --> 00:49:53.479 line:80%
Watch out!

1115
00:49:54.645 --> 00:49:56.604 line:80%
God bless you!

1116
00:49:57.729 --> 00:49:59.145 line:80%
Why'd you drop it two inches further, huh?

1117
00:49:59.395 --> 00:50:01.145 line:80%
Why didn't you drop it on my head instead?

1118
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.479 line:80%
Sorry, Brother.

1119
00:50:02.562 --> 00:50:03.854 line:80%
Don't you have anything better to do?

1120
00:50:04.062 --> 00:50:05.895 line:80%
You've been hanging flowers
around the house all day.

1121
00:50:05.979 --> 00:50:07.687 line:80%
What sorry, huh?

1122
00:50:21.229 --> 00:50:22.229 line:80%
Hey, Keri...

1123
00:50:22.354 --> 00:50:23.187 line:80%
- Hmm?
- Listen...

1124
00:50:24.979 --> 00:50:26.104 line:80%
Tell me,

1125
00:50:26.895 --> 00:50:28.229 line:80%
is today really the 29th?

1126
00:50:28.437 --> 00:50:30.020 line:80%
Yeah, it's the 29th.

1127
00:50:30.187 --> 00:50:33.270 line:80%
I just feel like the turmeric stuff,
all of this, happened yesterday,

1128
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.062 line:80%
and now it's repeating again.

1129
00:50:36.604 --> 00:50:38.020 line:80%
That's called Deja vu.

1130
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.812 line:80%
You sometimes feel like
it's already happened,

1131
00:50:40.895 --> 00:50:42.354 line:80%
but it hasn't. Got it?

1132
00:50:43.145 --> 00:50:44.020 line:80%
Really?

1133
00:50:45.062 --> 00:50:47.062 line:80%
So, what I saw was just
a super realistic dream?

1134
00:50:47.645 --> 00:50:49.312 line:80%
Yeah, looks like it.

1135
00:50:49.895 --> 00:50:50.729 line:80%
I see.

1136
00:50:50.812 --> 00:50:54.020 line:80%
So, you're saying today's the 29th,

1137
00:50:54.187 --> 00:50:55.895 line:80%
and tomorrow's the 30th, right?

1138
00:50:56.104 --> 00:50:57.312 line:80%
- Today's the 29th.
- Yeah.

1139
00:50:57.562 --> 00:50:59.062 line:80%
So, obviously, tomorrow's the 30th!

1140
00:50:59.645 --> 00:51:00.687 line:80%
Yep.

1141
00:51:00.979 --> 00:51:03.187 line:80%
Here, take Mom's petticoat
and get it dyed.

1142
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:05.187 line:80%
- I don't run errands like that.
- Don't make a fuss, just go.

1143
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.312 line:80%
Don't forget, okay?

1144
00:51:06.395 --> 00:51:07.479 line:80%
- Hey...
- Be careful with it. Bye!

1145
00:51:07.562 --> 00:51:08.729 line:80%
I've got a lot to do.

1146
00:51:10.729 --> 00:51:12.270 line:80%
Here's Mom's petticoat.

1147
00:51:12.354 --> 00:51:13.895 line:80%
- It needs to be dyed this color.
- Okay, Brother.

1148
00:51:15.395 --> 00:51:16.645 line:80%
Hey, what's the date today?

1149
00:51:16.812 --> 00:51:17.812 line:80%
29th, Brother.

1150
00:51:17.895 --> 00:51:18.895 line:80%
Why?

1151
00:51:19.187 --> 00:51:20.145 line:80%
Just checking.

1152
00:51:20.937 --> 00:51:21.895 line:80%
See you later.

1153
00:51:22.687 --> 00:51:23.854 line:80%
Mahadev!

1154
00:51:25.729 --> 00:51:27.020 line:80%
What's up, Brother?

1155
00:51:28.229 --> 00:51:29.895 line:80%
What's up, Mr. Groom?

1156
00:51:30.062 --> 00:51:31.437 line:80%
Where are you off to, huh?

1157
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.020 line:80%
I just came to get Mom's petticoat dyed.

1158
00:51:33.062 --> 00:51:35.104 line:80%
- I know everything.
- Come on, man!

1159
00:51:35.187 --> 00:51:37.812 line:80%
Happy inside, acting shy outside, right?

1160
00:51:41.479 --> 00:51:42.645 line:80%
Damn it.

1161
00:51:47.229 --> 00:51:50.062 line:80%
It stinks like the cow
had radish parathas for dinner.

1162
00:51:50.395 --> 00:51:51.895 line:80%
Don't be so upset, Brother.

1163
00:51:52.229 --> 00:51:54.020 line:80%
This is the holy cow's blessings.

1164
00:51:54.062 --> 00:51:55.062 line:80%
- Really?
- Yeah.

1165
00:51:55.187 --> 00:51:56.020 line:80%
Her blessings, huh?

1166
00:51:56.187 --> 00:51:58.312 line:80%
- Well, here, you can have some too.
- Hey!

1167
00:51:59.187 --> 00:52:00.354 line:80%
Right.

1168
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.270 line:80%
What's up, Mr. Groom?

1169
00:52:03.645 --> 00:52:08.020 line:80%
Hey, have they started using cow dung
instead of turmeric these days?

1170
00:52:08.104 --> 00:52:09.187 line:80%
Hey...

1171
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.104 line:80%
Uncle, forget about that.

1172
00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:13.520 line:80%
Did you do what you went there to do?

1173
00:52:14.312 --> 00:52:16.062 line:80%
Everything's set, man.

1174
00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.520 line:80%
What's set? Tell me!

1175
00:52:18.854 --> 00:52:22.020 line:80%
Come on , Mr. Groom,
how can I tell you that

1176
00:52:22.104 --> 00:52:25.812 line:80%
we've arranged
a surprise bachelor's party for you.

1177
00:52:25.895 --> 00:52:27.229 line:80%
- A surprise party?
- Yeah.

1178
00:52:27.312 --> 00:52:28.187 line:80%
And I have no idea about it.

1179
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.687 line:80%
Forget that and just get ready for it.

1180
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:32.687 line:80%
- Har Har...
- Here.

1181
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:49.729 line:80%
I enchant with my style,

1182
00:52:49.812 --> 00:52:53.229 line:80%
I remove every hesitation,

1183
00:52:53.312 --> 00:52:56.895 line:80%
Make me squirm

1184
00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:00.687 line:80%
with sweet pain, O heartless one.

1185
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:02.395 line:80%
You seem dear to me,

1186
00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:04.187 line:80%
A sleeping intention is awakened,

1187
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.062 line:80%
If you deny it, it's betrayal.

1188
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.645 line:80%
Your eyes have misled me,

1189
00:53:09.729 --> 00:53:11.312 line:80%
This place seems desolate,

1190
00:53:11.395 --> 00:53:13.229 line:80%
My heart says...

1191
00:53:13.437 --> 00:53:16.812 line:80%
Beloved.

1192
00:53:16.895 --> 00:53:20.437 line:80%
Beloved.

1193
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.770 line:80%
Beloved.

1194
00:53:24.687 --> 00:53:27.270 line:80%
Beloved.

1195
00:53:27.354 --> 00:53:30.645 line:80%
Enchant me with your charm,

1196
00:53:30.937 --> 00:53:34.104 line:80%
Make my forget the world, O fair one

1197
00:53:34.395 --> 00:53:38.020 line:80%
Your youth is like burning flames,

1198
00:53:38.062 --> 00:53:41.854 line:80%
In it, let me burn, O fair one

1199
00:53:42.479 --> 00:53:44.187 line:80%
I am fire, I am a flame,

1200
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.020 line:80%
But I am also cool water.

1201
00:53:46.104 --> 00:53:47.854 line:80%
Today, I belong to you,

1202
00:53:47.937 --> 00:53:49.520 line:80%
But tomorrow, I will be a stranger.

1203
00:53:49.604 --> 00:53:51.312 line:80%
Lovers come to my doorstep,

1204
00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:53.062 line:80%
Thirsting for love...

1205
00:53:53.145 --> 00:53:54.937 line:80%
Spreading love, quench their thirst,

1206
00:53:54.979 --> 00:53:56.770 line:80%
That's what I do with my passion.

1207
00:53:56.854 --> 00:53:58.520 line:80%
That's what I do with my passion.

1208
00:53:58.604 --> 00:54:01.562 line:80%
Beloved.

1209
00:54:02.104 --> 00:54:04.854 line:80%
Beloved.

1210
00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.104 line:80%
Beloved.

1211
00:54:09.104 --> 00:54:11.979 line:80%
Beloved.

1212
00:54:44.437 --> 00:54:46.187 line:80%
Keep this box over there.

1213
00:54:46.312 --> 00:54:48.020 line:80%
Why are you carrying it over your head?

1214
00:54:48.104 --> 00:54:49.687 line:80%
Ma'am, where do you want me
to put this box of oil?

1215
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:50.854 line:80%
Why don't you put it on my head?

1216
00:54:50.937 --> 00:54:52.312 line:80%
Obviously, you'll put it in the kitchen!

1217
00:54:52.395 --> 00:54:54.145 line:80%
I've been working non-stop...

1218
00:54:58.645 --> 00:55:03.229 line:80%
"In the turmeric, my dear,
in the turmeric..."

1219
00:55:03.312 --> 00:55:04.770 line:80%
It's this way. Come on now.

1220
00:55:04.854 --> 00:55:06.312 line:80%
You'll take two hours...

1221
00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:34.895 line:80%
What's wrong with my son?

1222
00:55:37.729 --> 00:55:39.437 line:80%
Move back, everyone,
let him get some fresh air.

1223
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.895 line:80%
Move back, move back, everyone.

1224
00:55:41.062 --> 00:55:42.729 line:80%
- Yes, yes.
- He's starting to wake up.

1225
00:55:48.395 --> 00:55:49.104 line:80%
What's the date today?

1226
00:55:49.187 --> 00:55:50.104 line:80%
- Huh? Why?
- Why?

1227
00:55:50.187 --> 00:55:51.895 line:80%
What... what's the date today?!

1228
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:52.854 line:80%
What happened?

1229
00:55:53.104 --> 00:55:55.020 line:80%
That's the problem,
Dad, it's not happening.

1230
00:55:55.104 --> 00:55:57.729 line:80%
I think he's constipated.
It's nothing new.

1231
00:55:57.812 --> 00:55:59.854 line:80%
Keri, my child, go get the laxatives.

1232
00:55:59.937 --> 00:56:01.312 line:80%
- Okay, Dad.
- Keri, Keri, Keri...

1233
00:56:01.645 --> 00:56:02.645 line:80%
What's today's date?

1234
00:56:02.729 --> 00:56:05.020 line:80%
- 29th... it's the 29th...
- 29th!

1235
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:07.812 line:80%
Yesterday you said, "Today's the 29th,
and tomorrow's the 30th!"

1236
00:56:07.895 --> 00:56:08.604 line:80%
You said that yesterday, right?

1237
00:56:08.687 --> 00:56:10.062 line:80%
That's what I'm saying today.

1238
00:56:10.145 --> 00:56:11.437 line:80%
Today's the 29th, and tomorrow's the 30th.

1239
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.812 line:80%
No, you said that yesterday.

1240
00:56:12.895 --> 00:56:14.687 line:80%
Yesterday was the 29th,
so today would be the 30th, right?

1241
00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:15.812 line:80%
- What are you saying?
- I told you...

1242
00:56:15.895 --> 00:56:16.937 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

1243
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:20.562 line:80%
I told you not to let him out
of the house until the wedding.

1244
00:56:20.645 --> 00:56:24.229 line:80%
- He's been possessed.
- I'm not possessed, Mom!

1245
00:56:24.312 --> 00:56:25.562 line:80%
How do I...

1246
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:28.395 line:80%
Huh?

1247
00:56:28.895 --> 00:56:30.812 line:80%
- Turmeric!
- He's lost it.

1248
00:56:30.895 --> 00:56:33.229 line:80%
We're back to the turmeric
ceremony again, seriously?!

1249
00:56:34.062 --> 00:56:35.520 line:80%
How do I explain this to you?

1250
00:56:36.562 --> 00:56:37.229 line:80%
This...

1251
00:56:37.312 --> 00:56:38.437 line:80%
What?

1252
00:56:39.687 --> 00:56:41.062 line:80%
Mom, come with me.

1253
00:56:41.145 --> 00:56:41.729 line:80%
What happened?

1254
00:56:41.812 --> 00:56:42.645 line:80%
- Dad?
- Yeah?

1255
00:56:42.729 --> 00:56:43.437 line:80%
Come with me.

1256
00:56:43.604 --> 00:56:44.437 line:80%
What is it?
Move aside.

1257
00:56:44.604 --> 00:56:45.979 line:80%
- What is it?
- This flower pot?

1258
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:46.770 line:80%
Yeah?

1259
00:56:46.854 --> 00:56:47.604 line:80%
Look at it.

1260
00:56:47.687 --> 00:56:48.812 line:80%
We're looking at it.

1261
00:56:49.354 --> 00:56:50.312 line:80%
Keep looking at it.

1262
00:56:51.229 --> 00:56:52.187 line:80%
Hey...

1263
00:56:53.937 --> 00:56:54.729 line:80%
This flower pot...

1264
00:56:54.812 --> 00:56:55.812 line:80%
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

1265
00:56:56.187 --> 00:56:57.145 line:80%
It's going to fall.

1266
00:56:57.604 --> 00:56:58.687 line:80%
It will fall on its own?

1267
00:56:58.770 --> 00:56:59.895 line:80%
It'll fall now. Just wait and watch.

1268
00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:00.895 line:80%
Hey...

1269
00:57:00.979 --> 00:57:01.770 line:80%
When is it going to fall, son?

1270
00:57:01.854 --> 00:57:02.812 line:80%
We're getting late
for the turmeric ceremony.

1271
00:57:02.895 --> 00:57:03.979 line:80%
Not the turmeric ceremony again!

1272
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.187 line:80%
Don't ever mention it again!

1273
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:06.562 line:80%
I don't want any turmeric paste on me!

1274
00:57:06.645 --> 00:57:07.604 line:80%
Huh?

1275
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.062 line:80%
Fall...

1276
00:57:10.937 --> 00:57:12.770 line:80%
- Fall...
- How can it fall on its own?

1277
00:57:12.979 --> 00:57:13.979 line:80%
Fall...

1278
00:57:14.604 --> 00:57:16.104 line:80%
It falls!

1279
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.062 line:80%
- When will it fall? My neck's hurting.
- It'll fall soon!

1280
00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:21.395 line:80%
Where's the decorator?

1281
00:57:21.854 --> 00:57:22.479 line:80%
There he is.

1282
00:57:22.562 --> 00:57:25.312 line:80%
Hey, what are you doing here?
Go do your job. Go, go, go.

1283
00:57:25.687 --> 00:57:26.895 line:80%
- Yeah.
- You put up flowers every day, don't you?

1284
00:57:26.979 --> 00:57:28.062 line:80%
- Yeah.
- Go, put the flowers up.

1285
00:57:28.312 --> 00:57:30.229 line:80%
- Now you watch, it'll fall.
- Okay, okay.

1286
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.479 line:80%
When's it going to fall, Your Highness?

1287
00:57:32.562 --> 00:57:33.437 line:80%
It'll fall, Dad.

1288
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.687 line:80%
Start working already!

1289
00:57:41.187 --> 00:57:43.020 line:80%
Brother, if everyone's going
to stare at me,

1290
00:57:43.104 --> 00:57:44.145 line:80%
I'm going to get nervous.

1291
00:57:44.229 --> 00:57:46.020 line:80%
It's not like I'm asking you
to sing a song,

1292
00:57:46.437 --> 00:57:47.979 line:80%
so why would you get nervous?
Just do your job.

1293
00:57:48.062 --> 00:57:48.979 line:80%
Okay, I'm doing it.

1294
00:57:49.479 --> 00:57:51.312 line:80%
Not the ones in the back,
the flowers in the front.

1295
00:57:51.395 --> 00:57:53.562 line:80%
- Yes, yes.
- Fine, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

1296
00:57:54.312 --> 00:57:57.437 line:80%
Reduce the gap!
Or I'll use my sandals on you!

1297
00:57:59.312 --> 00:58:00.395 line:80%
It fell!

1298
00:58:00.729 --> 00:58:02.145 line:80%
It fell! It fell!

1299
00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:03.854 line:80%
This is the one! I told you!

1300
00:58:03.979 --> 00:58:05.729 line:80%
I told you it would fall, and it fell!

1301
00:58:05.812 --> 00:58:09.312 line:80%
Great magic trick, son.

1302
00:58:10.895 --> 00:58:12.645 line:80%
Now you want me to show you
a magic trick of my own?

1303
00:58:12.729 --> 00:58:13.187 line:80%
Magic?

1304
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:15.395 line:80%
Yeah, you said the flower pot would...

1305
00:58:15.895 --> 00:58:17.354 line:80%
- Fall?
- It would fall.

1306
00:58:17.437 --> 00:58:18.604 line:80%
And what's this?

1307
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:20.812 line:80%
- Your hand.
- Now you...

1308
00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:25.312 line:80%
Move your head forward.

1309
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.729 line:80%
I'll go blind.

1310
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:29.812 line:80%
How else is he supposed to check?

1311
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.020 line:80%
Unnecessary drama.

1312
00:58:33.687 --> 00:58:35.812 line:80%
So, you think yesterday was the 29th too?

1313
00:58:35.895 --> 00:58:36.645 line:80%
Yeah.

1314
00:58:36.729 --> 00:58:38.270 line:80%
And what was the date the day
before yesterday?

1315
00:58:38.937 --> 00:58:40.812 line:80%
The day before yesterday
was also the 29th.

1316
00:58:41.604 --> 00:58:43.020 line:80%
If yesterday was the 29th,

1317
00:58:43.104 --> 00:58:45.270 line:80%
then the day before yesterday
should've been the 28th, right?

1318
00:58:46.187 --> 00:58:48.312 line:80%
He's terrible at math, really bad.

1319
00:58:48.562 --> 00:58:50.729 line:80%
He's always been bad at math.

1320
00:58:50.812 --> 00:58:52.979 line:80%
You've always had a problem with my math.

1321
00:58:53.062 --> 00:58:54.270 line:80%
Why didn't you send me
for extra coaching then?

1322
00:58:54.354 --> 00:58:56.104 line:80%
I was going to, but...

1323
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:58.187 line:80%
I've been living the 29th
for two days now,

1324
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:59.270 line:80%
and the day just won't change to the 30th.

1325
00:58:59.354 --> 00:59:00.604 line:80%
Why doesn't anyone get it?

1326
00:59:00.854 --> 00:59:02.270 line:80%
Why are you crying?

1327
00:59:02.437 --> 00:59:04.312 line:80%
The doctor says
everything's going to be fine.

1328
00:59:04.395 --> 00:59:05.729 line:80%
How is everything going to be fine?

1329
00:59:05.812 --> 00:59:07.354 line:80%
He's lost his mind,
and tomorrow's his wedding.

1330
00:59:08.104 --> 00:59:09.187 line:80%
I've lost my mind?

1331
00:59:11.104 --> 00:59:13.104 line:80%
- Put it on speaker.
- Okay.

1332
00:59:13.312 --> 00:59:14.229 line:80%
Hello?

1333
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.479 line:80%
Hello, Sister-in-law.
I seek your blessings.

1334
00:59:15.562 --> 00:59:16.229 line:80%
What happened?

1335
00:59:16.312 --> 00:59:18.104 line:80%
Keri said you guys went to the doctor?

1336
00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:20.770 line:80%
Nothing happened, Ranjan's just...

1337
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.812 line:80%
What? I'm coming there.

1338
00:59:22.895 --> 00:59:24.354 line:80%
No, Sister-in-law.
You don't need to come here.

1339
00:59:24.437 --> 00:59:25.562 line:80%
Don't worry about it.

1340
00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:26.979 line:80%
Hello?

1341
00:59:27.895 --> 00:59:29.354 line:80%
You're impossible.

1342
00:59:29.812 --> 00:59:31.812 line:80%
What, Uncle, I didn't tell her anything.

1343
00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.187 line:80%
Hey, hey, hey,
where do you think you're going?

1344
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.145 line:80%
Hey, what's got him worked up now?

1345
00:59:36.229 --> 00:59:37.270 line:80%
Nephew!

1346
00:59:37.354 --> 00:59:39.395 line:80%
Listen, nephew! Just hear me out!

1347
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:40.562 line:80%
Brother!

1348
00:59:41.312 --> 00:59:43.604 line:80%
Brother!
Getting angry isn't going to help!

1349
00:59:43.687 --> 00:59:45.187 line:80%
Just listen to me, Nephew.

1350
00:59:45.479 --> 00:59:47.312 line:80%
I don't want to be checked by that quack.

1351
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.854 line:80%
Everyone in Banaras knows he's just
a compounder pretending to be a doctor,

1352
00:59:50.937 --> 00:59:52.062 line:80%
and you took me to him?

1353
00:59:52.145 --> 00:59:54.187 line:80%
Then let's go to BHU, Brother.

1354
00:59:54.479 --> 00:59:56.729 line:80%
I'll slap you so hard you'll have
a tattoo on your face.

1355
00:59:57.562 --> 00:59:59.229 line:80%
Do I look sick to you?

1356
00:59:59.312 --> 01:00:00.312 line:80%
Do I?

1357
01:00:00.687 --> 01:00:03.895 line:80%
Fine, let's say you're stuck on the 30th.

1358
01:00:04.312 --> 01:00:06.562 line:80%
The 29th.
I'm stuck on the 29th.

1359
01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.437 line:80%
Fine, whatever,

1360
01:00:08.854 --> 01:00:10.770 line:80%
but how did you get stuck there?

1361
01:00:12.354 --> 01:00:13.854 line:80%
That's what I don't get

1362
01:00:13.937 --> 01:00:15.520 line:80%
- how did I get stuck?
- Yes.

1363
01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:17.354 line:80%
Here, have some sweets.

1364
01:00:17.437 --> 01:00:18.770 line:80%
What's up with Mr. Shukla?

1365
01:00:19.104 --> 01:00:20.145 line:80%
Indeed, Uncle.

1366
01:00:20.229 --> 01:00:21.437 line:80%
Why did he shave his head?

1367
01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.687 line:80%
I'd pledged that
if my daughter-in-law got pregnant,

1368
01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.187 line:80%
I'd shave my head.

1369
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.979 line:80%
So, as soon as my wish came true,
I got my head shaved.

1370
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.979 line:80%
- It's all Mahadev's blessings.
- Yes.

1371
01:00:33.187 --> 01:00:35.937 line:80%
'Son, go outside, get some milk,'

1372
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:41.229 line:80%
'offer it to Mahadev with a clean heart.'

1373
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.812 line:80%
'and pledge that if He fulfills your wish.

1374
01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.437 line:80%
'Lord...'

1375
01:00:44.729 --> 01:00:46.187 line:80%
'You are my only hope.'

1376
01:00:46.729 --> 01:00:48.645 line:80%
'Get me a government job.'

1377
01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.187 line:80%
'I will do a good deed.'

1378
01:01:04.645 --> 01:01:05.812 line:80%
Got it!

1379
01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.020 line:80%
I got it!

1380
01:01:07.104 --> 01:01:08.270 line:80%
Uncle, I know why.

1381
01:01:08.645 --> 01:01:09.854 line:80%
I get it!

1382
01:01:10.062 --> 01:01:11.229 line:80%
Mr. Shukla!

1383
01:01:11.312 --> 01:01:12.437 line:80%
What is it, Brother?

1384
01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.395 line:80%
- Mr. Shukla, I get it now!
- What is this?

1385
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:16.937 line:80%
What, Brother?

1386
01:01:16.979 --> 01:01:19.604 line:80%
I know why I'm stuck on the 29th.

1387
01:01:19.729 --> 01:01:21.395 line:80%
You won't get it, Shukla.
You should leave.

1388
01:01:21.562 --> 01:01:23.354 line:80%
Alright, come on,
get the
Ladoos
here.

1389
01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.520 line:80%
Glory to the Lord.

1390
01:01:44.604 --> 01:01:47.812 line:80%
Glory to the Lord.

1391
01:01:47.895 --> 01:01:52.229 line:80%
Glory to the Lord.

1392
01:02:02.604 --> 01:02:04.395 line:80%
The day before yesterday was the 29th,

1393
01:02:04.604 --> 01:02:06.145 line:80%
yesterday was the 29th,

1394
01:02:06.229 --> 01:02:07.604 line:80%
and today's still the 29th?

1395
01:02:08.104 --> 01:02:10.770 line:80%
My head's spinning with
all the stuff you're saying.

1396
01:02:11.437 --> 01:02:12.729 line:80%
I just don't get it.

1397
01:02:14.312 --> 01:02:16.854 line:80%
So, you're telling me
you're stuck on the 29th

1398
01:02:16.937 --> 01:02:18.270 line:80%
because you didn't keep your pledge?

1399
01:02:18.354 --> 01:02:19.187 line:80%
Yeah.

1400
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:21.312 line:80%
Well, I haven't exactly kept
all my pledges either,

1401
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.729 line:80%
but I didn't get stuck in a time loop.

1402
01:02:22.812 --> 01:02:24.437 line:80%
What am I supposed
to do if I'm the Chosen One?

1403
01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.604 line:80%
Well, just go fulfill the pledge you made.

1404
01:02:27.854 --> 01:02:29.895 line:80%
Uncle, that's exactly
what I've been thinking.

1405
01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:30.979 line:80%
Okay.

1406
01:02:32.062 --> 01:02:33.062 line:80%
Hey...

1407
01:02:33.145 --> 01:02:35.020 line:80%
- Sister-in-law! I seek you blessings.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

1408
01:02:35.229 --> 01:02:36.729 line:80%
- Why is she here?
- What happened?

1409
01:02:36.812 --> 01:02:38.145 line:80%
I don't know, Titli.

1410
01:02:38.229 --> 01:02:39.770 line:80%
It's all flying over my head right now.

1411
01:02:39.937 --> 01:02:41.729 line:80%
He says he's stuck on the 29th.

1412
01:02:42.895 --> 01:02:44.187 line:80%
What happened, Babu?

1413
01:02:44.354 --> 01:02:46.062 line:80%
Why'd you go to the doctor?

1414
01:02:47.145 --> 01:02:48.270 line:80%
Nothing happened.

1415
01:02:48.562 --> 01:02:50.104 line:80%
You go, I'll handle it. Just leave.

1416
01:02:51.062 --> 01:02:53.437 line:80%
I left my henna ceremony in the middle,

1417
01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:56.562 line:80%
I've been walking around
Banaras dressed as a bride,

1418
01:02:56.729 --> 01:02:57.854 line:80%
and you want me to leave?

1419
01:02:57.937 --> 01:02:59.895 line:80%
You can't even care for others these days.

1420
01:03:00.395 --> 01:03:02.479 line:80%
Oh, Titli...
My slippers.

1421
01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:03.937 line:80%
Tell me everything.

1422
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.104 line:80%
- Come here and sit down. Sit here.
- I'll sit.

1423
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:07.229 line:80%
Sit down.

1424
01:03:07.312 --> 01:03:10.062 line:80%
Now listen to me carefully.

1425
01:03:10.145 --> 01:03:11.312 line:80%
What do you want me to listen to?

1426
01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:12.895 line:80%
Everything I'm about to tell you.

1427
01:03:13.312 --> 01:03:15.229 line:80%
I go to sleep on the night of the 29th,

1428
01:03:15.312 --> 01:03:16.145 line:80%
Hmm.

1429
01:03:16.312 --> 01:03:17.437 line:80%
and when I wake up,

1430
01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:19.187 line:80%
it's the 29th again!

1431
01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:20.729 line:80%
- Huh?
- Yeah.

1432
01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:23.729 line:80%
- What does that mean?
- It means...

1433
01:03:24.687 --> 01:03:26.604 line:80%
the date won't change to the 30th, Titli!

1434
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:30.729 line:80%
- The date won't change for you...
- Yeah.

1435
01:03:30.812 --> 01:03:32.645 line:80%
And you won't let it change for me!

1436
01:03:33.354 --> 01:03:35.937 line:80%
You rascal,
you can never do anything on your own.

1437
01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.604 line:80%
Now that things are finally working out,
you're trying to ruin it.

1438
01:03:38.687 --> 01:03:40.145 line:80%
I'm ruining it?

1439
01:03:40.229 --> 01:03:41.020 line:80%
Yes!

1440
01:03:41.104 --> 01:03:41.895 line:80%
Hey...

1441
01:03:41.979 --> 01:03:44.479 line:80%
Titli, I made a pledge
to God to get a job.

1442
01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.229 line:80%
But I didn't keep it,

1443
01:03:46.395 --> 01:03:47.770 line:80%
so now God's got me stuck in this loop.

1444
01:03:47.854 --> 01:03:49.687 line:80%
He got me stuck in this 29th loop!

1445
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.104 line:80%
I'm trapped in this loop.

1446
01:03:51.854 --> 01:03:55.354 line:80%
I didn't leave my henna ceremony
for you to tell me this crap!

1447
01:03:55.687 --> 01:03:58.562 line:80%
If you don't want to marry me,
just tell me already, Ranjan Tiwari!

1448
01:03:58.854 --> 01:04:01.687 line:80%
My sister still hasn't even paid off
my wedding lehenga!

1449
01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:03.312 line:80%
- He's talking nonsense.
- Titli, stop crying.

1450
01:04:03.604 --> 01:04:04.729 line:80%
What if he's actually telling the truth?

1451
01:04:04.812 --> 01:04:05.937 line:80%
You're right.

1452
01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.937 line:80%
Your sister's totally right.
She's so smart.

1453
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:08.895 line:80%
- Tell me something.
- Yeah?

1454
01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:10.645 line:80%
What's the solution
to this problem of yours?

1455
01:04:11.104 --> 01:04:12.020 line:80%
Solution?

1456
01:04:12.354 --> 01:04:14.645 line:80%
I pledged to do a good deed,

1457
01:04:14.854 --> 01:04:16.770 line:80%
but I never said what.

1458
01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:19.229 line:80%
He doesn't even know how
to make a proper pledge!

1459
01:04:19.312 --> 01:04:20.562 line:80%
So what should I do?
Jump into the river and die?

1460
01:04:20.645 --> 01:04:21.895 line:80%
Yes, jump into the river and die!

1461
01:04:21.979 --> 01:04:23.312 line:80%
Calm down for a second, will you?

1462
01:04:24.354 --> 01:04:25.895 line:80%
- You want to do a good deed, right?
- Yeah.

1463
01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:26.937 line:80%
Do anything.

1464
01:04:27.437 --> 01:04:28.145 line:80%
Anything?

1465
01:04:28.229 --> 01:04:29.020 line:80%
Okay.

1466
01:04:29.145 --> 01:04:30.145 line:80%
What should I do?

1467
01:04:31.229 --> 01:04:33.020 line:80%
There are plenty of options,
just do anything.

1468
01:04:33.312 --> 01:04:34.229 line:80%
Okay.

1469
01:04:34.312 --> 01:04:35.020 line:80%
What should I do?

1470
01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.604 line:80%
Brother, just shave your head
like Shukla did.

1471
01:04:36.687 --> 01:04:37.562 line:80%
It's the best option.

1472
01:04:38.437 --> 01:04:40.062 line:80%
- Come here, please.
- Yeah, Sister-in-law?

1473
01:04:40.354 --> 01:04:42.520 line:80%
Why don't we shave your head instead?

1474
01:04:42.937 --> 01:04:44.437 line:80%
I don't want to marry a bald guy!

1475
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.104 line:80%
"I don't want to marry a bald guy!"

1476
01:04:46.187 --> 01:04:47.395 line:80%
Will you just be quiet for two minutes?

1477
01:04:47.729 --> 01:04:49.687 line:80%
Two smart old people
are talking here, so just hush.

1478
01:04:49.854 --> 01:04:52.020 line:80%
Brother, you could also feed a black dog.

1479
01:04:52.104 --> 01:04:52.895 line:80%
Get lost.

1480
01:04:52.979 --> 01:04:54.187 line:80%
Feed a black dog?

1481
01:04:54.395 --> 01:04:58.187 line:80%
I think you should feed
a cow flatbreads with jaggery.

1482
01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:00.312 line:80%
There's no deed greater than that.

1483
01:05:00.395 --> 01:05:01.854 line:80%
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Do that.

1484
01:05:01.937 --> 01:05:04.020 line:80%
- You'll be done with your good deed.
- Yeah, okay.

1485
01:05:04.104 --> 01:05:05.729 line:80%
- Feed a cow flatbreads and jaggery?
- Yes.

1486
01:05:05.812 --> 01:05:06.562 line:80%
He's right.

1487
01:05:06.645 --> 01:05:07.354 line:80%
Like a pooranpoli?

1488
01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:08.354 line:80%
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1489
01:05:14.395 --> 01:05:15.604 line:80%
Here, here, here.

1490
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:18.354 line:80%
Have it.

1491
01:05:20.854 --> 01:05:23.229 line:80%
That's a bull, man.

1492
01:05:24.062 --> 01:05:25.312 line:80%
The cow's over there.

1493
01:05:25.687 --> 01:05:27.770 line:80%
- Come on, Brother!
- Forgive me, please forgive me.

1494
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:30.145 line:80%
Here, here, here.

1495
01:05:30.479 --> 01:05:31.562 line:80%
Yes.

1496
01:05:35.562 --> 01:05:36.645 line:80%
There you go, Brother.

1497
01:05:36.729 --> 01:05:37.812 line:80%
You've fulfilled your pledge.

1498
01:05:37.895 --> 01:05:38.854 line:80%
Yes.

1499
01:05:39.104 --> 01:05:42.312 line:80%
Just wait and see if you pull
off another drama!

1500
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.270 line:80%
- Oh, such anger.
- Let's go, Sister.

1501
01:05:44.354 --> 01:05:47.104 line:80%
Do you feel any different, Brother?

1502
01:05:48.479 --> 01:05:49.729 line:80%
No, I don't feel any different.

1503
01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:52.187 line:80%
Don't overthink it.

1504
01:05:52.312 --> 01:05:53.604 line:80%
Just come with me.

1505
01:05:53.895 --> 01:05:57.437 line:80%
I've got a killer plan for you.

1506
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.645 line:80%
Once you see it,

1507
01:05:58.729 --> 01:06:00.604 line:80%
you'll forget all about the 29th and 30th.

1508
01:06:01.062 --> 01:06:02.395 line:80%
I know everything.

1509
01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:04.270 line:80%
You've invited Jugni, right?

1510
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:06.479 line:80%
You're throwing me
a surprise bachelor party.

1511
01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:07.687 line:80%
I know everything.

1512
01:06:09.812 --> 01:06:10.770 line:80%
How do you know?

1513
01:06:14.479 --> 01:06:15.854 line:80%
That's what I've been
trying to tell you...

1514
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:20.687 line:80%
You told him, didn't you?

1515
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:22.270 line:80%
Come on Uncle, why would I tell him?

1516
01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.687 line:80%
The butterfly flew,but couldn't really fly

1517
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:29.937 line:80%
She got on the bus, but didn't find a seat

1518
01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.145 line:80%
The butterfly flew,but couldn't really fly

1519
01:06:32.229 --> 01:06:34.437 line:80%
She got on the bus, but didn't find a seat

1520
01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.604 line:80%
she started crying becauseshe didn't get a seat.

1521
01:06:36.729 --> 01:06:38.895 line:80%
"The driver said, "Come with me!"

1522
01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:41.020 line:80%
Come with me!

1523
01:06:41.187 --> 01:06:44.520 line:80%
The butterfly said, 'Go away, naughty!

1524
01:06:44.604 --> 01:06:46.812 line:80%
-
Go away, naughty! My house is nearby.
- Where are you off to, huh?

1525
01:06:46.895 --> 01:06:48.979 line:80%
- Go away, naughty!
- Babu!

1526
01:06:49.062 --> 01:06:51.312 line:80%
Go away, naughty! My house is nearby.

1527
01:06:59.562 --> 01:07:01.770 line:80%
Putting my heart into it, my love,

1528
01:07:01.854 --> 01:07:03.979 line:80%
I convinced my mother.

1529
01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:08.854 line:80%
I asked them to get me married,but still they said no.

1530
01:07:09.479 --> 01:07:11.687 line:80%
My mother didn't accept my family;

1531
01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:13.895 line:80%
what's the point of living now,even if I try?

1532
01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:18.145 line:80%
I feel like I will give up my life.

1533
01:07:18.229 --> 01:07:20.312 line:80%
Go away, naughty!

1534
01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:22.562 line:80%
Go away, naughty! My house is nearby.

1535

Go away, naughty! My house is nearby.

1537
01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:39.187 line:80%
Also have your throat slit while
you have him cutting your hair.

1538
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:41.770 line:80%
Or give it to me
and I'll slit my wrist.

1539
01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.062 line:80%
Even if getting marriedleads to destruction, so be it.

1540
01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:47.562 line:80%
No matter what happens,

1541
01:07:47.645 --> 01:07:49.854 line:80%
I will take you with me.

1542
01:07:49.937 --> 01:07:53.979 line:80%
We will run in such a way,the world will search for us.

1543
01:07:54.062 --> 01:07:57.104 line:80%
Go away, naughty!

1544
01:07:57.187 --> 01:07:59.395 line:80%
So you're having trouble staying
awake for just one day, huh?

1545
01:07:59.479 --> 01:08:02.645 line:80%
Try being in my shoes.
I've been stuck in the same day for 15 days!

1546
01:08:03.062 --> 01:08:04.187 line:80%
Let me just nap for an hour.

1547
01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:06.437 line:80%
It s already 11:45 pm.
Just 15 more minutes.

Hey...

1557
01:08:29.437 --> 01:08:30.354 line:80%
So, you want me
all covered in turmeric, huh?

1558
01:08:30.437 --> 01:08:34.687 line:80%
- Alright, the turmeric ceremony's all done now.
- Huh? What is he doing?

1559

- Yep, now the day's finally complete!
Go away, naughty! My house is nearby.

So, what do you think, Sister-in-law?
The chicken's nice and juicy now, right?

1562
01:08:41.104 --> 01:08:42.312 line:80%
Is this how you talk to your sister-in-law?

1563
01:08:42.395 --> 01:08:44.812 line:80%
- This is just how I talk!
- Mom, I m done, clean me up.

1564
01:08:44.895 --> 01:08:47.979 line:80%
He's been pooping for days.
Somebody wash him already!

1565
01:08:49.187 --> 01:08:50.437 line:80%
Keri, Keri, wait.

1566
01:08:50.604 --> 01:08:51.687 line:80%
Come, sit down.

1567
01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:57.187 line:80%
Now your brother's getting married, so...

1568
01:08:57.645 --> 01:08:58.520 line:80%
Yeah, so?

1569
01:08:59.312 --> 01:09:01.812 line:80%
So, we can do it, right?

1570
01:09:02.187 --> 01:09:03.229 line:80%
What?

1571
01:09:05.062 --> 01:09:06.270 line:80%
Kiss.

1572
01:09:07.187 --> 01:09:08.187 line:80%
You want to kiss me?

1573
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.145 line:80%
Yeah.

1574
01:09:11.062 --> 01:09:12.062 line:80%
Here?

1575
01:09:14.854 --> 01:09:16.104 line:80%
- Are you done?
- No.

1576
01:09:16.395 --> 01:09:17.645 line:80%
Not this kiss,

1577
01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:18.645 line:80%
Then?

1578
01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:20.270 line:80%
that one.

1579
01:09:20.354 --> 01:09:21.104 line:80%
That one?

1580
01:09:21.187 --> 01:09:23.187 line:80%
Yeah, that one...

1581
01:09:23.729 --> 01:09:24.562 line:80%
Hey!

1582
01:09:24.812 --> 01:09:25.812 line:80%
- Move.
- What's going on here?

1583
01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:26.479 line:80%
Brother!

1584
01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.354 line:80%
I came to drop these mattresses,
and she stopped me.

1585
01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.812 line:80%
- Shut up.
- She did, yeah.

1586
01:09:29.895 --> 01:09:33.937 line:80%
My life's a mess,
and you two are over here romancing?

1587
01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.229 line:80%
Come on, Brother, just hear me out.
Keri, explain it to him.

1588
01:09:36.312 --> 01:09:37.770 line:80%
What are you doing? Let go of his neck.

1589
01:09:37.854 --> 01:09:38.937 line:80%
I should let go of his neck?

1590
01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.270 line:80%
Fine, I'll let it go.

1591
01:09:40.562 --> 01:09:42.854 line:80%
I'll hit him with my shoes instead!

1592
01:09:42.937 --> 01:09:45.354 line:80%
- Bro, Brother, I got you that job!
- Quit it.

1593
01:09:45.437 --> 01:09:46.312 line:80%
So, should I just marry

1594
01:09:46.395 --> 01:09:47.479 line:80%
- my sister to you now?
- No!

1595
01:09:47.562 --> 01:09:48.437 line:80%
What are you doing?

1596
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.270 line:80%
He's your future brother-in-law.

1597
01:09:50.354 --> 01:09:51.562 line:80%
Yeah, your brother-in-law.

1598
01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:52.854 line:80%
This baby beaver?

1599
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:54.895 line:80%
Couldn't you find anyone
better than this cricket?

1600
01:09:54.979 --> 01:09:56.895 line:80%
Brother, we really love each other.

1601
01:09:56.979 --> 01:09:58.895 line:80%
- We're totally crazy about each other.
- True love, man, true love!

1602
01:09:58.979 --> 01:10:01.020 line:80%
Hold on, let me get rid of all this love.

1603
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.187 line:80%
Do one thing: just jump off the roof. Go.

1604
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:05.562 line:80%
Have you lost your mind?

1605
01:10:05.645 --> 01:10:07.104 line:80%
- Just jump.
- It's too high.

1606
01:10:07.187 --> 01:10:08.979 line:80%
- Stay there, Brother, or I'll jump.
- Keri, get out of my way.

1607
01:10:09.062 --> 01:10:10.604 line:80%
Have you lost your mind?
He'll jump! What are you doing?

1608
01:10:10.687 --> 01:10:12.145 line:80%
I'll end up hurting you,
Keri, get out of my way.

1609
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:14.854 line:80%
Har Har Mahadev!

1610
01:10:18.187 --> 01:10:20.145 line:80%
Who does that, man?!

1611
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:25.562 line:80%
Does this family's only son-in-law
have any respect at all?

1612
01:10:29.979 --> 01:10:31.145 line:80%
He's alive.

1613
01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:33.687 line:80%
For now.

1614
01:10:37.395 --> 01:10:38.812 line:80%
What's up, Mr. Groom?

1615
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.229 line:80%
Where are you off to, huh?

1616
01:10:42.062 --> 01:10:44.062 line:80%
Why should I tell you
where am I going every day, huh?

1617
01:10:44.395 --> 01:10:45.604 line:80%
Are you my dad or what?

1618
01:10:47.187 --> 01:10:48.062 line:80%
Mind your own business!

1619
01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:50.187 line:80%
Ugh!

1620
01:11:01.062 --> 01:11:03.604 line:80%
So, you're telling me
you're stuck on the 29th

1621
01:11:03.687 --> 01:11:05.145 line:80%
because you didn't keep your pledge?

1622
01:11:05.354 --> 01:11:07.145 line:80%
I say that every day!

1623
01:11:07.645 --> 01:11:08.187 line:80%
Okay.

1624
01:11:08.312 --> 01:11:09.270 line:80%
I say that every day!

1625
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:12.729 line:80%
- Sister-in-law! I seek you blessings.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

1626
01:11:12.812 --> 01:11:13.687 line:80%
What happened?

1627
01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:15.020 line:80%
I don't know, Titli.

1628
01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.395 line:80%
It's all flying over my head right now.

1629
01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:17.895 line:80%
He says he's stuck on the 29th.

1630
01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:18.812 line:80%
Huh?

1631
01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:21.062 line:80%
What happened, Babu?

1632
01:11:21.437 --> 01:11:25.062 line:80%
Keri called me and said you caused
a scene at home and just stormed out.

1633
01:11:25.145 --> 01:11:26.104 line:80%
What happened?

1634
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:27.354 line:80%
Nothing happened.

1635
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:30.187 line:80%
You go, I'll handle it. Just leave.

1636
01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:33.604 line:80%
I left my henna ceremony...

1637
01:11:33.687 --> 01:11:34.854 line:80%
I left my henna ceremony in the middle,

1638
01:11:34.937 --> 01:11:36.479 line:80%
I've been walking around
Banaras dressed as a bride.

1639
01:11:36.562 --> 01:11:37.229 line:80%
I can never seem to handle things
by myself.

1640
01:11:37.312 --> 01:11:38.229 line:80%
You're the one
who's been taking care of everything.

1641
01:11:38.312 --> 01:11:39.229 line:80%
I just keep messing everything up.

1642
01:11:39.312 --> 01:11:40.812 line:80%
You still haven't paid for the lehenga.

1643
01:11:40.895 --> 01:11:42.270 line:80%
I know everything, okay?!

1644
01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.437 line:80%
Wow,

1645
01:11:43.895 --> 01:11:44.854 line:80%
that's amazing!

1646
01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:49.395 line:80%
Why...

1647
01:11:49.979 --> 01:11:51.854 line:80%
why can't you just understand
what I'm trying to say for once?

1648
01:11:52.979 --> 01:11:53.979 line:80%
I'm...

1649
01:11:54.812 --> 01:11:56.229 line:80%
Why do I even bother trying? Forget it.

1650
01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:57.229 line:80%
Babu...

1651
01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:58.937 line:80%
I'M NOT BABU!

1652
01:11:59.687 --> 01:12:00.770 line:80%
My name's Ranjan.

1653
01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.062 line:80%
See what I mean?

1654
01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:14.895 line:80%
- Hey...
- Priest!

1655
01:12:14.979 --> 01:12:16.437 line:80%
- Priest! Priest! Priest!
- Who is it?

1656
01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.479 line:80%
Greetings.

1657
01:12:18.312 --> 01:12:19.187 line:80%
Mahadev!

1658
01:12:20.062 --> 01:12:22.895 line:80%
Remember me? I gave you Rs. 100
in cash and Re. 1 through UPI?

1659
01:12:23.604 --> 01:12:25.062 line:80%
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.
- Right.

1660
01:12:25.687 --> 01:12:28.395 line:80%
So, what's going on?
In the middle of the night...

1661
01:12:28.479 --> 01:12:31.937 line:80%
I'm in big trouble.

1662
01:12:33.145 --> 01:12:34.062 line:80%
Big trouble?

1663
01:12:34.145 --> 01:12:35.020 line:80%
Yeah.

1664
01:12:35.187 --> 01:12:36.145 line:80%
What happened?

1665
01:12:36.812 --> 01:12:38.062 line:80%
I can't keep my pledge.

1666
01:12:39.145 --> 01:12:40.145 line:80%
What pledge?

1667
01:12:40.395 --> 01:12:41.437 line:80%
The one about doing a good deed.

1668
01:12:41.729 --> 01:12:42.895 line:80%
What good deed?

1669
01:12:44.437 --> 01:12:47.520 line:80%
Priest, you told me to make a pledge
to do a good deed, and I did.

1670
01:12:48.395 --> 01:12:50.395 line:80%
I didn't say which good deed, though.

1671
01:12:50.979 --> 01:12:52.145 line:80%
Now I'm stuck because of it.

1672
01:12:52.479 --> 01:12:55.645 line:80%
I've fed cows, dogs, monkeys,
and humans-everyone.

1673
01:12:55.895 --> 01:12:57.854 line:80%
I've donated a lot of money too.

1674
01:12:57.979 --> 01:13:02.895 line:80%
I've even lit a lamp under every kind
of tree-big, small, thin, thick.

1675
01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.895 line:80%
But somehow,
I just can't fulfill my pledge.

1676
01:13:05.479 --> 01:13:06.312 line:80%
You get what I mean?

1677
01:13:06.437 --> 01:13:07.395 line:80%
Hmm.

1678
01:13:07.854 --> 01:13:08.770 line:80%
Priest, please...

1679
01:13:09.104 --> 01:13:10.395 line:80%
please help me out.

1680
01:13:12.437 --> 01:13:13.729 line:80%
You have to do something.

1681
01:13:14.312 --> 01:13:15.479 line:80%
Yes, I will.

1682
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:17.520 line:80%
Then do it.

1683
01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.812 line:80%
I see, I see, I see.

1684
01:13:20.895 --> 01:13:22.312 line:80%
Sorry, sorry.

1685
01:13:22.895 --> 01:13:26.562 line:80%
Here, Rs. 100.
I'll send Re. 1 through UPI.

1686
01:13:26.645 --> 01:13:29.395 line:80%
No, son, this is a big problem.

1687
01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:30.562 line:80%
It is.

1688
01:13:31.062 --> 01:13:33.187 line:80%
So my fee will be Rs. 501.

1689
01:13:38.895 --> 01:13:40.604 line:80%
Now, quickly, tell me the solution.

1690
01:13:41.812 --> 01:13:43.062 line:80%
Son, the thing is,

1691
01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:49.479 line:80%
all the good deeds
you just mentioned are fine.

1692
01:13:49.562 --> 01:13:50.520 line:80%
Yes.

1693
01:13:52.312 --> 01:13:57.729 line:80%
But your problem is different.

1694
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:00.645 line:80%
Is it possible that...

1695
01:14:03.687 --> 01:14:05.479 line:80%
you hurt someone's feelings?

1696
01:14:06.562 --> 01:14:07.937 line:80%
I...

1697
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:13.145 line:80%
Yes, you've either knowingly
or unknowingly hurt someone's feelings.

1698
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:19.895 line:80%
That's why your pledge is stuck.

1699
01:14:29.979 --> 01:14:32.604 line:80%
Brother Ranjan, you look awesome!

1700
01:14:32.687 --> 01:14:33.729 line:80%
Good morning!

1701
01:14:33.812 --> 01:14:36.229 line:80%
Good morning!
Now, try this on.

1702
01:14:36.312 --> 01:14:37.229 line:80%
Here you go.

1703
01:14:37.979 --> 01:14:40.562 line:80%
It's a masterpiece.

1704
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:41.687 line:80%
It's awesome!

1705
01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:44.479 line:80%
You look like a clown.

1706
01:14:44.812 --> 01:14:45.687 line:80%
Huh?

1707
01:14:45.979 --> 01:14:47.312 line:80%
How dare you!

1708
01:14:47.687 --> 01:14:50.354 line:80%
She's talking to me, not you.

1709
01:14:50.729 --> 01:14:52.354 line:80%
Well, then she's right.

1710
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:54.979 line:80%
- What... what are you doing?
- Bless me.

1711
01:14:55.104 --> 01:14:56.104 line:80%
What's this?

1712
01:14:56.312 --> 01:14:58.062 line:80%
I'm asking for your blessings, Father.

1713
01:14:58.145 --> 01:14:59.479 line:80%
Father? Who's Father?

1714
01:14:59.687 --> 01:15:02.104 line:80%
You're my father, and I'm your son.

1715
01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:03.479 line:80%
Huh?

1716
01:15:04.104 --> 01:15:06.687 line:80%
What have you made?

1717
01:15:06.854 --> 01:15:09.312 line:80%
It looks more like a bag than a sherwani.

1718
01:15:09.395 --> 01:15:11.687 line:80%
Calm down. Father, please calm down.

1719
01:15:12.479 --> 01:15:13.520 line:80%
It's okay.

1720
01:15:13.604 --> 01:15:14.937 line:80%
Please forgive him.

1721
01:15:16.062 --> 01:15:20.229 line:80%
Take it back and fix it.

1722
01:15:20.604 --> 01:15:21.395 line:80%
Huh?

1723
01:15:21.687 --> 01:15:23.687 line:80%
Because I've got plenty of time.

1724
01:15:27.645 --> 01:15:29.145 line:80%
If I've hurt you in any way,

1725
01:15:29.479 --> 01:15:30.729 line:80%
please forgive me.

1726
01:15:36.687 --> 01:15:39.520 line:80%
- So... sorry, Brother.
- No, no, no need.

1727
01:15:39.729 --> 01:15:40.770 line:80%
Are you okay?

1728
01:15:40.854 --> 01:15:41.979 line:80%
Yeah, Brother.

1729
01:15:42.687 --> 01:15:44.562 line:80%
If I've hurt you in any way,

1730
01:15:45.062 --> 01:15:46.437 line:80%
please forgive me.

1731
01:15:46.604 --> 01:15:47.604 line:80%
Huh?

1732
01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:50.770 line:80%
And take good care of my sister.

1733
01:15:51.562 --> 01:15:52.520 line:80%
Okay, Brother.

1734
01:15:52.895 --> 01:15:54.979 line:80%
A lot of people keep going to the terrace,

1735
01:15:55.104 --> 01:15:56.312 line:80%
so be careful.

1736
01:15:58.229 --> 01:16:00.145 line:80%
You should try hanging exercises,
you know.

1737
01:16:01.437 --> 01:16:02.604 line:80%
Okay, Brother.

1738
01:16:03.979 --> 01:16:05.187 line:80%
Hurry up, girls.

1739
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.062 line:80%
Mix some more of this, will you?
We need enough to apply on him.

1740
01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:08.854 line:80%
- Okay, Aunty.
- You're just wasting time talking.

1741
01:16:08.937 --> 01:16:10.812 line:80%
I seek your blessing, Mother.

1742
01:16:10.895 --> 01:16:11.770 line:80%
Such anger?

1743
01:16:11.854 --> 01:16:15.062 line:80%
Wow, where did the sun come from today?

1744
01:16:15.145 --> 01:16:16.395 line:80%
Yes, Brother-in-law?

1745
01:16:16.604 --> 01:16:19.020 line:80%
You're touching your mom's feet today,

1746
01:16:19.187 --> 01:16:21.312 line:80%
but tomorrow you'll be taking
orders from your wife.

1747
01:16:21.395 --> 01:16:22.645 line:80%
Hey!

1748
01:16:22.937 --> 01:16:24.937 line:80%
I'm really looking forward
to that "tomorrow," Sister-in-law.

1749
01:16:25.895 --> 01:16:27.479 line:80%
It just needs to get here.

1750
01:16:29.104 --> 01:16:31.729 line:80%
Mom, I'm done, come clean me up.

1751
01:16:31.895 --> 01:16:33.729 line:80%
Sister-in-law, forget the turmeric

1752
01:16:33.895 --> 01:16:35.979 line:80%
and clean up the mess inside first.

1753
01:16:36.062 --> 01:16:37.062 line:80%
I'm going, I'm going, Brother-in-law.

1754
01:16:37.145 --> 01:16:40.229 line:80%
And if I've hurt you in any way,
please forgive me.

1755
01:16:40.479 --> 01:16:43.062 line:80%
Stop talking, sit down,
and apply some turmeric.

1756
01:16:43.395 --> 01:16:45.270 line:80%
Anything you say, Mother.
Just give me a minute.

1757
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.854 line:80%
Has he lost it?

1758
01:16:46.937 --> 01:16:48.062 line:80%
What's wrong with him?

1759
01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:49.270 line:80%
Forget him.

1760
01:16:54.854 --> 01:16:55.854 line:80%
Sorry, Brother.

1761
01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:58.562 line:80%
- It fell by mistake.
- No, no,

1762
01:16:58.979 --> 01:17:00.354 line:80%
it was meant to fall.

1763
01:17:00.479 --> 01:17:01.895 line:80%
It's part of its destiny.

1764
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:03.187 line:80%
Are you okay?

1765
01:17:03.437 --> 01:17:04.312 line:80%
Yeah.

1766
01:17:04.937 --> 01:17:07.062 line:80%
You've done such a great job
decorating my house.

1767
01:17:07.437 --> 01:17:08.562 line:80%
Thank you.

1768
01:17:09.062 --> 01:17:10.770 line:80%
And if I've hurt you in any way,

1769
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:12.354 line:80%
please forgive me.

1770
01:17:12.562 --> 01:17:15.187 line:80%
Hey, magpie, have you lost your mind?

1771
01:17:15.312 --> 01:17:17.020 line:80%
Why are you apologizing to everyone?

1772
01:17:17.104 --> 01:17:18.812 line:80%
So what?
Go apply the turmeric.

1773
01:17:18.895 --> 01:17:19.812 line:80%
Father, please don't be mad.

1774
01:17:19.895 --> 01:17:22.187 line:80%
What are you doing up there?
Get down now!

1775
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:24.145 line:80%
If I've hurt you in any way,
please forgive me.

1776
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:25.145 line:80%
Mahadev!

1777
01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:26.395 line:80%
Mahadev! If I've hurt you in any way,
please forgive me.

1778
01:17:26.479 --> 01:17:27.687 line:80%
What's up, Mr. Groom?

1779
01:17:27.895 --> 01:17:29.479 line:80%
- Where are you off to, huh?
- Oh!

1780
01:17:30.395 --> 01:17:32.145 line:80%
Sorry about yesterday.

1781
01:17:33.062 --> 01:17:34.854 line:80%
I got mad at you.

1782
01:17:35.562 --> 01:17:36.937 line:80%
I'm heading out now.

1783
01:17:38.145 --> 01:17:39.354 line:80%
Ugh.

1784
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:42.729 line:80%
If I've hurt you in any way,
please forgive me.

1785
01:17:43.437 --> 01:17:45.229 line:80%
I end up stepping on you every day.

1786
01:17:47.104 --> 01:17:48.395 line:80%
Mahadev!

1787
01:17:51.145 --> 01:17:56.187 line:80%
I'm lucky to have both of you in my life.

1788
01:17:57.104 --> 01:17:58.520 line:80%
- Really?
- What's wrong?

1789
01:17:59.479 --> 01:18:00.812 line:80%
You in some kind of trouble?

1790
01:18:00.895 --> 01:18:02.604 line:80%
No, no, no.

1791
01:18:04.187 --> 01:18:06.312 line:80%
I just want to say something
to both of you.

1792
01:18:08.104 --> 01:18:11.895 line:80%
If I've hurt you in any way,
knowingly or unknowingly,

1793
01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:13.520 line:80%
if I've made any mistakes,

1794
01:18:14.312 --> 01:18:15.979 line:80%
please forgive me.

1795
01:18:16.145 --> 01:18:17.812 line:80%
What are you saying, Brother?

1796
01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.104 line:80%
- Yes! We'd die for you.
- Yeah.

1797
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.395 line:80%
I don't know why, but I feel like

1798
01:18:23.479 --> 01:18:25.145 line:80%
I've hurt your feelings.

1799
01:18:25.395 --> 01:18:26.604 line:80%
Yeah, you have.

1800
01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:27.854 line:80%
What are you saying, Brother?

1801
01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.395 line:80%
You're my ideal.

1802
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.687 line:80%
I haven't hurt your feelings?

1803
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:32.187 line:80%
Damn.

1804
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:35.020 line:80%
Then whose curse is at work here?

1805
01:18:35.104 --> 01:18:36.020 line:80%
Curse?

1806
01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:38.770 line:80%
Yeah, it...

1807
01:18:39.187 --> 01:18:40.479 line:80%
I'll tell you later.

1808
01:18:41.437 --> 01:18:45.729 line:80%
First, think about whose feelings
I might've hurt in Banaras.

1809
01:18:47.187 --> 01:18:51.895 line:80%
There's only one guy in Banaras
whose feelings you've hurt badly.

1810
01:18:52.604 --> 01:18:53.479 line:80%
Who?

1811
01:18:59.562 --> 01:19:00.645 line:80%
So, Dad,

1812
01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.479 line:80%
here's my problem.

1813
01:19:02.937 --> 01:19:04.937 line:80%
God only knows
whose curse is at work here.

1814
01:19:05.437 --> 01:19:06.854 line:80%
I'm stuck on the 29th!

1815
01:19:06.937 --> 01:19:08.395 line:80%
The day never changes to the 30th for me.

1816
01:19:08.479 --> 01:19:09.229 line:80%
Huh?

1817
01:19:09.395 --> 01:19:11.395 line:80%
The 30th, the date won't change for me.

1818
01:19:11.979 --> 01:19:13.354 line:80%
- What's he saying?
- There you go.

1819
01:19:14.104 --> 01:19:15.604 line:80%
You were so excited that day.

1820
01:19:15.687 --> 01:19:17.312 line:80%
"30th is perfect, just perfect!"

1821
01:19:17.395 --> 01:19:18.812 line:80%
Now the date won't change to 30th for him.

1822
01:19:18.895 --> 01:19:19.145 line:80%
Yes.

1823
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:21.895 line:80%
The offer I got from the electricity
department was better.

1824
01:19:21.979 --> 01:19:23.145 line:80%
At least the day would've
changed to the 30th.

1825
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:24.187 line:80%
Right.

1826
01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.895 line:80%
Nephew, do you want me to hurt your
brother-in-law's feelings right here?

1827
01:19:28.062 --> 01:19:29.645 line:80%
He's talking too much.

1828
01:19:32.937 --> 01:19:34.187 line:80%
Hey... Son...

1829
01:19:34.479 --> 01:19:36.145 line:80%
I'm your wife's brother-in-law.

1830
01:19:37.437 --> 01:19:38.645 line:80%
If I've hurt you in any way,
please forgive me.

1831
01:19:38.729 --> 01:19:40.354 line:80%
Who touches his feet, huh?

1832
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:43.145 line:80%
Dad, please tell me, what should I do?

1833
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:44.354 line:80%
What should I really do?

1834
01:19:44.437 --> 01:19:46.104 line:80%
What should I say?

1835
01:19:46.854 --> 01:19:48.229 line:80%
Have you told your dad?

1836
01:19:48.395 --> 01:19:49.270 line:80%
What?

1837
01:19:49.354 --> 01:19:50.645 line:80%
About this illness?

1838
01:19:51.562 --> 01:19:52.895 line:80%
I have.

1839
01:19:52.979 --> 01:19:54.229 line:80%
I've told everyone,

1840
01:19:54.687 --> 01:19:56.479 line:80%
but no one believes me.

1841
01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:00.145 line:80%
So, Dad, the thing is,

1842
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:01.979 line:80%
if tomorrow the date changes to the 30th,

1843
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:03.562 line:80%
I'll be here with the wedding procession.

1844
01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:06.437 line:80%
If it doesn't, then...

1845
01:20:06.604 --> 01:20:07.604 line:80%
Then?

1846
01:20:11.479 --> 01:20:12.645 line:80%
What did he say?

1847
01:20:39.937 --> 01:20:41.229 line:80%
Brother Ranjan!

1848
01:20:41.354 --> 01:20:42.520 line:80%
Hey, where are you off to?

1849
01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:43.854 line:80%
Hey, listen for a second.

1850
01:20:43.937 --> 01:20:45.062 line:80%
- Where are you headed?
- Look...

1851
01:20:45.145 --> 01:20:46.520 line:80%
You should at least put
on some turmeric first.

1852
01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.854 line:80%
Give me a quarter.

1853
01:21:16.062 --> 01:21:17.895 line:80%
I'm sorry, Titli.

1854
01:21:19.312 --> 01:21:22.520 line:80%
Your "Babu" never did anything for you.

1855
01:21:25.979 --> 01:21:27.562 line:80%
Nor for himself, either.

1856
01:21:29.604 --> 01:21:31.937 line:80%
I don't have any other choice now.

1857
01:21:36.687 --> 01:21:38.687 line:80%
It's way too high, way too high.

1858
01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.520 line:80%
I'm not going to mess up your 30th

1859
01:21:43.145 --> 01:21:45.812 line:80%
just because of my bad luck with the 29th.

1860
01:21:45.979 --> 01:21:47.395 line:80%
I won't!

1861
01:21:49.937 --> 01:21:51.270 line:80%
Oh, Holy Ganges,

1862
01:21:53.437 --> 01:21:54.979 line:80%
please ensure my salvation.

1863
01:22:01.687 --> 01:22:02.562 line:80%
What's up?

1864
01:22:02.937 --> 01:22:03.854 line:80%
Who are you?

1865
01:22:05.104 --> 01:22:07.229 line:80%
You don't think this
is a risky spot for a selfie?

1866
01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.229 line:80%
You'll fall, get down.

1867
01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:11.729 line:80%
Get down now.

1868
01:22:16.479 --> 01:22:18.687 line:80%
Hey, I meant get down on the road,
not into the river.

1869
01:22:19.895 --> 01:22:22.395 line:80%
They don't even let you
commit suicide in peace.

1870
01:22:26.854 --> 01:22:28.979 line:80%
Are you swimming or drowning?

1871
01:22:31.604 --> 01:22:32.687 line:80%
Mahadev...

1872
01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.104 line:80%
Come on, seriously...

1873
01:22:49.979 --> 01:22:51.604 line:80%
Just stick two fingers
in your mouth like this,

1874
01:22:51.687 --> 01:22:52.812 line:80%
and all the water will come out.

1875
01:22:52.895 --> 01:22:53.895 line:80%
That's what I did.

1876
01:22:53.979 --> 01:22:54.937 line:80%
I'm fine.

1877
01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.729 line:80%
Totally killed my buzz too!

1878
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:59.312 line:80%
Are you good?

1879
01:23:03.354 --> 01:23:04.520 line:80%
Why were you thinking
about ending your life?

1880
01:23:07.979 --> 01:23:09.270 line:80%
What was I supposed to do?

1881
01:23:09.895 --> 01:23:11.812 line:80%
I had no other choice.

1882
01:23:13.854 --> 01:23:15.104 line:80%
I get it.

1883
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:20.854 line:80%
Sometimes, you're in a situation
you just can't explain to anyone.

1884
01:23:23.729 --> 01:23:24.645 line:80%
Here you go.

1885
01:23:25.770 --> 01:23:26.687 line:80%
What's your name?

1886
01:23:30.562 --> 01:23:31.770 line:80%
Hamid Ansari.

1887
01:23:32.812 --> 01:23:33.937 line:80%
You're from Monal?

1888
01:23:35.479 --> 01:23:36.687 line:80%
I'm originally from Loharia,

1889
01:23:37.062 --> 01:23:39.437 line:80%
but I've been here
for the last seven years.

1890
01:23:40.979 --> 01:23:42.104 line:80%
Your family?

1891
01:23:43.895 --> 01:23:46.437 line:80%
They're back home in the village.

1892
01:23:48.104 --> 01:23:50.520 line:80%
Have you imagined what would have
happened to them if you had died?

1893
01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:56.104 line:80%
Why were you ending your life?
What's the problem?

1894
01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:00.562 line:80%
The same thing half
of our population is dealing with.

1895
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:04.020 line:80%
I see, you're heartbroken.

1896
01:24:05.354 --> 01:24:06.312 line:80%
No.

1897
01:24:06.729 --> 01:24:08.104 line:80%
It's the government job thing.

1898
01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.979 line:80%
Damn, this government job issue...

1899
01:24:13.187 --> 01:24:14.354 line:80%
I get it.

1900
01:24:20.979 --> 01:24:21.729 line:80%
Hey,

1901
01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:23.895 line:80%
tell me something

1902
01:24:24.729 --> 01:24:26.729 line:80%
if you get a job,
you won't end your life, right?

1903
01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:29.187 line:80%
Why would I die if I get a job, Brother?

1904
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:32.437 line:80%
Perfect!

1905
01:24:33.145 --> 01:24:35.812 line:80%
You're my selfish good deed!

1906
01:24:37.145 --> 01:24:40.020 line:80%
Now, Ranjan Tiwari will risk
his own life to get you that job.

1907
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:41.312 line:80%
Just wait and watch.

1908
01:24:41.812 --> 01:24:44.020 line:80%
From now on,
Ansari and Tiwari are brothers.

1909
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:46.354 line:80%
Peon!

1910
01:24:46.812 --> 01:24:48.187 line:80%
Two teas, please.

1911
01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.854 line:80%
Here to pay your dues?

1912
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:56.020 line:80%
Guru-ji,
I'll get you the money in a few days.

1913
01:24:57.604 --> 01:24:59.520 line:80%
Peon, forget the tea!

1914
01:24:59.604 --> 01:25:00.520 line:80%
Hey...

1915
01:25:00.604 --> 01:25:02.312 line:80%
No rush, take your time.

1916
01:25:02.395 --> 01:25:04.729 line:80%
Did he mention he's getting a big dowry?

1917
01:25:04.812 --> 01:25:07.395 line:80%
My bride's my dowry.
I don't go in for that stuff.

1918
01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:09.354 line:80%
So, what's up? Why are you here?

1919
01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:11.854 line:80%
Guru-ji, this is my friend, Hamid.

1920
01:25:11.937 --> 01:25:12.937 line:80%
Hello.

1921
01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:15.104 line:80%
I wanted to talk to you about his job.

1922
01:25:15.312 --> 01:25:16.562 line:80%
Yeah, he'll get it.

1923
01:25:16.854 --> 01:25:19.520 line:80%
Tell him about the payment details.

1924
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:22.729 line:80%
Well, Guru-ji,
he's a little short on cash.

1925
01:25:22.937 --> 01:25:24.854 line:80%
I'll take care of it.
Guru-ji, I'll figure something out.

1926
01:25:24.937 --> 01:25:27.395 line:80%
No, I don't want to pay for a job.

1927
01:25:27.479 --> 01:25:29.604 line:80%
You're not willing to pay for a job?

1928
01:25:29.687 --> 01:25:31.812 line:80%
I'm not here for charity.

1929
01:25:32.312 --> 01:25:34.020 line:80%
It's a risky job, ask him.

1930
01:25:34.104 --> 01:25:35.770 line:80%
- No, you're right.
- Obviously, I'm right.

1931
01:25:35.854 --> 01:25:39.437 line:80%
You'll get the job
and enjoy the perks of life.

1932
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.020 line:80%
After you're gone,
your wife will be set with your benefits.

1933
01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:43.145 line:80%
What do I get out of this?

1934
01:25:43.229 --> 01:25:44.229 line:80%
Nothing?

1935
01:25:44.312 --> 01:25:46.437 line:80%
Tell him, man.
You'll need to pay for it.

1936
01:25:46.562 --> 01:25:47.687 line:80%
We'll sort it out, we'll sort it.

1937
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:49.437 line:80%
Let me make this clear.

1938
01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.520 line:80%
First off, I don't have the money.

1939
01:25:51.604 --> 01:25:53.437 line:80%
Plus, I don't want to pay to get a job.

1940
01:25:53.854 --> 01:25:55.604 line:80%
Oh my God!

1941
01:25:55.895 --> 01:25:58.437 line:80%
Where did you find this freedom fighter?

1942
01:25:58.604 --> 01:26:00.187 line:80%
What's your name, Brother?

1943
01:26:00.854 --> 01:26:02.854 line:80%
Hamid... Hamid Ansari.

1944
01:26:03.895 --> 01:26:05.187 line:80%
How old are you?

1945
01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:06.729 line:80%
26.

1946
01:26:06.812 --> 01:26:10.687 line:80%
Struggle for another year or two,
and we'll get it done.

1947
01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:14.020 line:80%
We'll team up and make it happen.
Now leave him be, alright?

1948
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:15.479 line:80%
Go wait outside.

1949
01:26:16.979 --> 01:26:18.729 line:80%
You stay here.

1950
01:26:19.562 --> 01:26:20.354 line:80%
Sit down, man.

1951
01:26:20.437 --> 01:26:21.437 line:80%
You can go,

1952
01:26:22.145 --> 01:26:23.145 line:80%
he'll join you soon.

1953
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:24.020 line:80%
I'll be right with you.

1954
01:26:25.145 --> 01:26:26.729 line:80%
Where did you find this guy?

1955
01:26:27.729 --> 01:26:29.270 line:80%
What do I say, Guru-ji...

1956
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:33.562 line:80%
He's a good guy, Guru-ji.

1957
01:26:34.104 --> 01:26:35.145 line:80%
Please, help him out.

1958
01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:37.354 line:80%
"He's a good guy, please help him out!"

1959
01:26:38.729 --> 01:26:39.770 line:80%
There's only one way to fix this.

1960
01:26:39.854 --> 01:26:40.854 line:80%
What's that?

1961
01:26:41.145 --> 01:26:44.562 line:80%
You give up your job,
and he'll take your spot.

1962
01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.145 line:80%
What's that supposed to mean?

1963
01:26:47.312 --> 01:26:50.270 line:80%
He's the 15th guy

1964
01:26:51.312 --> 01:26:53.729 line:80%
I took off the list and swapped with you!

1965
01:26:54.604 --> 01:26:56.229 line:80%
Hamid Ansari.

1966
01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.645 line:80%
You'll lose your job,
and I'll lose my business.

1967
01:27:01.145 --> 01:27:03.187 line:80%
What's wrong with this generation,
seriously?!

1968
01:27:09.187 --> 01:27:11.479 line:80%
- Sister...!
- So you're saying

1969
01:27:11.729 --> 01:27:13.354 line:80%
he dies and comes back
to life every single day?

1970
01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:14.604 line:80%
Yep, every day!

1971
01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:15.854 line:80%
Every single day!

1972
01:27:15.979 --> 01:27:18.437 line:80%
I left my henna ceremony just
to hear this crap?

1973
01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.687 line:80%
It's just henna, chill out.

1974
01:27:19.812 --> 01:27:22.020 line:80%
It's not like you walked out
in the middle of taking a dump!

1975
01:27:22.104 --> 01:27:23.270 line:80%
Ugh, that's gross!

1976
01:27:23.354 --> 01:27:24.895 line:80%
You can just redo it.
You're doing it every day anyway.

1977
01:27:24.979 --> 01:27:26.687 line:80%
Come on, Brother,
why are you yelling at your sister-in-law?

1978
01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:29.562 line:80%
I dare him to yell at me.
I'll pull his tongue out!

1979
01:27:29.812 --> 01:27:32.354 line:80%
And you... you're not even my husband yet!

1980
01:27:32.437 --> 01:27:34.354 line:80%
Don't give me that husband attitude.

1981
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.770 line:80%
- I'm showing attitude?
- Yup, you are!

1982
01:27:35.854 --> 01:27:38.020 line:80%
What about you?
Always complaining about the henna?

1983
01:27:38.104 --> 01:27:40.020 line:80%
Alright, alright, stop fighting already.

1984
01:27:40.645 --> 01:27:41.895 line:80%
Tell me,

1985
01:27:42.687 --> 01:27:44.270 line:80%
why are you even getting into this?

1986
01:27:44.354 --> 01:27:46.187 line:80%
You worked hard to get that job.

1987
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.937 line:80%
Uncle, Hamid actually deserves this job.

1988
01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.312 line:80%
- Come on, man.
- I don't know who Hamid is.

1989
01:27:52.437 --> 01:27:54.645 line:80%
If it was meant for him,
he would've gotten it.

1990
01:27:54.729 --> 01:27:57.104 line:80%
- Yeah.
- It was meant for you, so you got it.

1991
01:27:57.479 --> 01:27:59.229 line:80%
If Hamid doesn't get the job,

1992
01:27:59.854 --> 01:28:01.020 line:80%
he's going to die.

1993
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:02.437 line:80%
Again.

1994
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:04.937 line:80%
Don't make me whack you!

1995
01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:07.729 line:80%
Whether he dies or not,
you're definitely die by my hands today.

1996
01:28:07.812 --> 01:28:09.312 line:80%
I'm right here,
go ahead and do it. Kill me.

1997
01:28:09.395 --> 01:28:10.645 line:80%
- Kill me again.
- You guys are fighting again?

1998
01:28:10.729 --> 01:28:12.062 line:80%
- Should I?
- Chill out.

1999
01:28:12.354 --> 01:28:15.145 line:80%
Listen, if you don't get that job,
you won't be able to get married either.

2000
01:28:15.562 --> 01:28:16.854 line:80%
And if you can't get married,

2001
01:28:16.937 --> 01:28:18.729 line:80%
you'll probably end up taking your life.

2002
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.479 line:80%
And if you do that,

2003
01:28:20.687 --> 01:28:22.770 line:80%
I'll go find Hamid and kill him.

2004
01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:23.979 line:80%
Yeah, Brother.

2005
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:25.979 line:80%
If he's going to die anyway,

2006
01:28:26.395 --> 01:28:27.895 line:80%
why even bother saving him?

2007
01:28:27.979 --> 01:28:30.020 line:80%
Uncle, it's important that we save Hamid.

2008
01:28:30.729 --> 01:28:32.729 line:80%
I think saving him is the good deed
I am supposed to do.

2009
01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:35.020 line:80%
and it's why all this mess started
in the first place.

2010
01:28:35.854 --> 01:28:36.645 line:80%
Hold up.

2011
01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:40.562 line:80%
You made a promise
at Lord Shiva's temple, right?

2012
01:28:40.812 --> 01:28:41.687 line:80%
Yeah.

2013
01:28:43.187 --> 01:28:44.479 line:80%
Then it's no big deal!

2014
01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:45.979 line:80%
What?

2015
01:28:46.062 --> 01:28:48.187 line:80%
Well, Hamid's Muslim.

2016
01:28:48.562 --> 01:28:49.937 line:80%
- Huh?
- Hmm.

2017
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:55.729 line:80%
How do you even do this?

2018
01:28:56.812 --> 01:28:58.854 line:80%
Listen, buddy, come with me,

2019
01:28:59.145 --> 01:29:02.687 line:80%
I've got a surprise
bachelor's party lined up for you.

2020
01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:03.812 line:80%
- Uncle...
- Forget the surprise party.

2021
01:29:03.895 --> 01:29:05.145 line:80%
Just hear me out.
Take me with you.

2022
01:29:05.229 --> 01:29:06.479 line:80%
- What? What bachelor party?
- Brother?

2023
01:29:06.562 --> 01:29:07.562 line:80%
- Where are you going?
- Brother?

2024
01:29:07.645 --> 01:29:09.145 line:80%
- Babu!
-
God!

2025
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:11.437 line:80%
You're such a weirdo.

2026
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.937 line:80%
You're trying to change his fate

2027
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:14.729 line:80%
hen he's just going
to die again tomorrow anyway.

2028
01:29:14.812 --> 01:29:15.604 line:80%
God!

2029
01:29:15.687 --> 01:29:17.895 line:80%
You're going to get scolded,
and I'm going to get scolded by Dad too.

2030
01:29:17.979 --> 01:29:19.687 line:80%
Sister, please, just drive faster.

2031
01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:20.895 line:80%
What do you want me to do, make it fly?

2032
01:29:20.979 --> 01:29:22.270 line:80%
Yes, Sister, make it fly.

2033
01:29:22.354 --> 01:29:23.604 line:80%
Hamid, no!

2034
01:29:23.812 --> 01:29:26.854 line:80%
Hamid, stop!

2035
01:29:26.937 --> 01:29:28.395 line:80%
- Go, go, go!
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2036
01:29:28.479 --> 01:29:30.979 line:80%
You see your life slipping away,

2037
01:29:31.062 --> 01:29:33.979 line:80%
Like sand through fingers that won t stay.

2038
01:29:34.062 --> 01:29:36.395 line:80%
- Nephew!
- Brother!

2039
01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:39.562 line:80%
Brother!

2040
01:29:39.645 --> 01:29:41.145 line:80%
- Move out of my way.
- Get him!

2041
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:42.479 line:80%
You jump too!

2042
01:29:42.562 --> 01:29:43.937 line:80%
I don't know how to swim.

2043
01:29:44.104 --> 01:29:45.270 line:80%
You jump! Jump!

2044
01:29:45.354 --> 01:29:46.937 line:80%
Sister-in-law,
I'm not wearing anything down there.

2045
01:29:47.104 --> 01:29:49.520 line:80%
He's got the worst friends!

2046
01:29:49.812 --> 01:29:51.020 line:80%
Come on!

2047
01:29:51.562 --> 01:29:53.354 line:80%
- Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law...
- Have you lost it?

2048
01:29:53.562 --> 01:29:54.354 line:80%
Then what am I supposed to do?

2049
01:29:54.437 --> 01:29:56.354 line:80%
Become a widow before
I even get married, Sister?

2050
01:29:56.437 --> 01:30:00.562 line:80%
Hearts flourish,When God s blessings nourish.

2051
01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:03.187 line:80%
Do you really have to die every day?

2052
01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.229 line:80%
What do you mean by every day?

2053
01:30:05.979 --> 01:30:08.062 line:80%
Why did you save me?

2054
01:30:08.604 --> 01:30:09.895 line:80%
You don't need to die.

2055
01:30:10.437 --> 01:30:12.437 line:80%
We'll figure something out.

2056
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:15.687 line:80%
There's no solution.
I don't have any options left.

2057
01:30:16.104 --> 01:30:17.562 line:80%
That's not true.

2058
01:30:18.187 --> 01:30:19.145 line:80%
Listen,

2059
01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.312 line:80%
if you're short on cash, don't worry.

2060
01:30:21.645 --> 01:30:24.145 line:80%
She'll easily get you 500-100,000.

2061
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:25.229 line:80%
I mean Titli.

2062
01:30:25.312 --> 01:30:27.020 line:80%
Hey, how am I going to get that?

2063
01:30:28.187 --> 01:30:30.229 line:80%
I'm not selling my mom's necklace again.

2064
01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.604 line:80%
I'm not a beggar.

2065
01:30:31.937 --> 01:30:32.979 line:80%
Let him die.

2066
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:34.270 line:80%
Did I ask you to save me?

2067
01:30:34.354 --> 01:30:35.937 line:80%
I didn't save you, did I?
Then why did you come here?

2068
01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:37.854 line:80%
- I didn't come here to save you.
- Why did you save me?

2069
01:30:37.937 --> 01:30:40.229 line:80%
Stop it!
Don't be upset, Hamid. He is...

2070
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:42.479 line:80%
Sit down, Uncle. Just sit down.

2071
01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:43.729 line:80%
Come, sit down.

2072
01:30:43.979 --> 01:30:46.770 line:80%
We'll figure it out.
Please don't end your life. Please don't.

2073
01:30:46.854 --> 01:30:49.229 line:80%
I don't need your help.

2074
01:30:49.604 --> 01:30:50.812 line:80%
- Hey!
- He wants to help me!

2075
01:30:50.895 --> 01:30:51.770 line:80%
Ansari!

2076
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:53.437 line:80%
There you go!

2077
01:30:54.062 --> 01:30:55.437 line:80%
Hamid!

2078
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.145 line:80%
Hey, hey, hey!

2079
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:59.229 line:80%
-
Money leads to hell,
- Yeah, I got this.

2080
01:30:59.312 --> 01:31:00.187 line:80%
Hey!

2081
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.687 line:80%
Uncle, be careful.

2082
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:04.229 line:80%
Hold your faith and fare it well.

2083
01:31:04.312 --> 01:31:05.770 line:80%
When God s blessings nourish.

2084
01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.520 line:80%
- Nephew!
- Brother!

2085
01:31:07.604 --> 01:31:09.145 line:80%
- Babu!
- Help!

2086
01:31:09.312 --> 01:31:11.312 line:80%
Hearts flourish,When God s blessings nourish.

2087
01:31:11.395 --> 01:31:14.437 line:80%
Alright, let's set a fixed income
of Rs. 10,000 every month, sound good?

2088
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:17.604 line:80%
Alright, how about Rs. 15,000?
Titli, Rs. 15,000, okay?

2089
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:19.729 line:80%
I don't need your help!

2090
01:31:19.812 --> 01:31:20.687 line:80%
Hey!

2091
01:31:21.187 --> 01:31:22.645 line:80%
How about
we finalize the deal at 20,000, huh?

2092
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:23.895 line:80%
Let him die.

2093
01:31:25.770 --> 01:31:27.687 line:80%
Forget about a job in India,
I'll get you an international one.

2094
01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:28.937 line:80%
How about working in Dubai?

2095
01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:29.895 line:80%
Saudi?

2096
01:31:29.979 --> 01:31:31.895 line:80%
I don't need your help!

2097
01:31:32.354 --> 01:31:34.354 line:80%
- He wants me to send me to Dubai!
- Thailand? How about Thailand?

2098
01:31:34.479 --> 01:31:36.854 line:80%
I told you, let him die.

2099
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:40.062 line:80%
25% share in my mom's pickle business,
deal?

2100
01:31:40.354 --> 01:31:42.354 line:80%
I don't need your help!

2101
01:31:42.645 --> 01:31:43.645 line:80%
Hey!

2102
01:31:43.854 --> 01:31:45.187 line:80%
How about 50%?

2103
01:31:46.145 --> 01:31:47.312 line:80%
I get it,

2104
01:31:47.895 --> 01:31:50.312 line:80%
the problem is you can't get married
because you don't have a job.

2105
01:31:50.479 --> 01:31:52.854 line:80%
I'll find you a wife.
Just don't die, okay?

2106
01:31:53.312 --> 01:31:54.770 line:80%
Titli, we'll find him a wife, right?

2107
01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.854 line:80%
Why don't you get him married
to me instead?

2108
01:31:56.937 --> 01:31:59.020 line:80%
- Huh?
- I don't need your help!

2109
01:31:59.187 --> 01:32:00.187 line:80%
Hey!

2110
01:32:00.562 --> 01:32:01.979 line:80%
How about a foreign wife?

2111
01:32:02.145 --> 01:32:04.812 line:80%
You never tried to find me a wife,
damn it!

2112
01:32:04.895 --> 01:32:06.937 line:80%
Bury your strength in the earth,

2113
01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:09.979 line:80%
One day, all will bow to the worth.

2114
01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:13.562 line:80%
It s inevitable,whether you believe or not,

2115
01:32:13.645 --> 01:32:15.312 line:80%
You re not strong,

2116
01:32:15.395 --> 01:32:17.104 line:80%
You re just human after all.

2117
01:32:17.187 --> 01:32:20.770 line:80%
Hearts flourish,When God s blessings nourish.

2118
01:32:20.854 --> 01:32:24.312 line:80%
Hearts flourish,When God s blessings nourish.

2119
01:32:24.395 --> 01:32:27.645 line:80%
Hearts flourish,When God s blessings

2120
01:32:27.729 --> 01:32:31.145 line:80%
When God s blessings nourish.

2121
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:33.687 line:80%
Catch.

2122
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:35.229 line:80%
Catch.

2123
01:32:38.437 --> 01:32:40.437 line:80%
God!

2124
01:32:41.187 --> 01:32:42.395 line:80%
I know...

2125
01:32:43.770 --> 01:32:45.395 line:80%
Your name's Hamid Ansari.

2126
01:32:46.062 --> 01:32:48.062 line:80%
You were going to jump off the bridge

2127
01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:50.270 line:80%
because you can't get a job.

2128
01:32:51.854 --> 01:32:53.520 line:80%
And let me tell you,

2129
01:32:53.729 --> 01:32:56.062 line:80%
my life's become a mess trying
to save you.

2130
01:32:57.687 --> 01:33:00.270 line:80%
You're educated. You look smart.
Just take another job.

2131
01:33:00.895 --> 01:33:03.020 line:80%
There are so many departments,
apply anywhere you want.

2132
01:33:03.479 --> 01:33:05.354 line:80%
Why are you so stuck on this job?

2133
01:33:06.145 --> 01:33:07.062 line:80%
Yeah?

2134
01:33:08.437 --> 01:33:10.562 line:80%
How do you know all this?

2135
01:33:10.979 --> 01:33:11.979 line:80%
Who are you?

2136
01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:13.979 line:80%
It's a high-level thing,

2137
01:33:14.312 --> 01:33:16.020 line:80%
you won't get it.

2138
01:33:16.854 --> 01:33:19.145 line:80%
Our buddy here seems to know everything.

2139
01:33:19.437 --> 01:33:19.979 line:80%
Right?

2140
01:33:20.062 --> 01:33:24.104 line:80%
Tell him all your problems.
Just tell him everything.

2141
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:26.104 line:80%
- Just do it, man.
- Tell me.

2142
01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:32.895 line:80%
For you, it's just a government job,

2143
01:33:33.145 --> 01:33:35.562 line:80%
but for me, it means everything.

2144
01:33:36.729 --> 01:33:38.312 line:80%
For the last 10 years,

2145
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:41.687 line:80%
our village has been struggling
with water shortages.

2146
01:33:43.437 --> 01:33:45.354 line:80%
First, we had a shortage
of water for the fields,

2147
01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:48.395 line:80%
and then we started running out
of drinking water too.

2148
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:53.062 line:80%
The villagers kept sending letters
to the irrigation department.

2149
01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:56.979 line:80%
But no one listened.

2150
01:33:58.895 --> 01:34:01.604 line:80%
When my father sent me
to Banaras to study,

2151
01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:06.895 line:80%
I promised all the villagers
I'd get an education,

2152
01:34:06.979 --> 01:34:09.562 line:80%
join the irrigation department,

2153
01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:12.770 line:80%
and fix the water problem.

2154
01:34:13.812 --> 01:34:15.437 line:80%
I worked really hard, Brother.

2155
01:34:16.645 --> 01:34:18.520 line:80%
I even did well on the exams this time.

2156
01:34:19.937 --> 01:34:21.229 line:80%
My father

2157
01:34:21.479 --> 01:34:25.270 line:80%
handed out sweets to everyone in the
village before the results even came out,

2158
01:34:26.187 --> 01:34:27.770 line:80%
thinking I'd get the job.

2159
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.104 line:80%
But my...

2160
01:34:31.895 --> 01:34:33.270 line:80%
My name wasn't on the list.

2161
01:34:34.312 --> 01:34:35.729 line:80%
My name wasn't on the list, Brother.

2162
01:34:37.354 --> 01:34:38.770 line:80%
What should I do now? Tell me.

2163
01:34:39.812 --> 01:34:41.270 line:80%
How can I go back to my village
and face them?

2164
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:44.979 line:80%
I rather jump into the Ganges and die.

2165
01:34:47.812 --> 01:34:49.145 line:80%
My name wasn't on the list.

2166
01:34:59.187 --> 01:35:01.062 line:80%
He ended up being a social worker.

2167
01:35:17.979 --> 01:35:18.979 line:80%
We're getting married tomorrow,

2168
01:35:19.104 --> 01:35:20.895 line:80%
and today you're telling me
you're quitting that job?

2169
01:35:24.854 --> 01:35:26.312 line:80%
What are you doing?
You're going to hurt me.

2170
01:35:26.395 --> 01:35:27.979 line:80%
You even ruined my henna!

2171
01:35:29.437 --> 01:35:31.062 line:80%
Hey! Titli...?

2172
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:33.020 line:80%
It's glass, I'll end up bleeding.

2173
01:35:44.104 --> 01:35:46.104 line:80%
Titli, I get your anger,

2174
01:35:47.895 --> 01:35:49.895 line:80%
but you don't understand
what I'm going through.

2175
01:35:51.062 --> 01:35:53.854 line:80%
I don't care.

2176
01:35:56.437 --> 01:35:59.604 line:80%
Find a way,
do whatever it takes...

2177
01:36:00.979 --> 01:36:02.895 line:80%
But don't leave the job.

2178
01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:10.354 line:80%
I've done so much for you,

2179
01:36:11.854 --> 01:36:14.562 line:80%
and you didn't think about me
even once, huh?

2180
01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:21.854 line:80%
You're worried about a guy
you don't even know, Ranjan!

2181
01:36:29.645 --> 01:36:32.104 line:80%
I made a mistake falling for you.

2182
01:36:34.854 --> 01:36:35.979 line:80%
Titli...

2183
01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:43.729 line:80%
Listen to me, Ranjan Tiwari!

2184
01:36:45.062 --> 01:36:46.437 line:80%
Do whatever it takes,

2185
01:36:47.187 --> 01:36:50.479 line:80%
but if we don't get married
on the 30th of this month, Ranjan...

2186
01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:56.270 line:80%
No, Titli, what... what are you doing?
Let go of it, let go of it right now!

2187
01:37:01.854 --> 01:37:05.270 line:80%
I'm not as strong as I seem, Ranjan.

2188
01:37:07.479 --> 01:37:09.437 line:80%
I'll fall apart without you.

2189
01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.229 line:80%
Come on.

2190
01:37:25.479 --> 01:37:26.479 line:80%
Here it is.

2191
01:37:26.562 --> 01:37:27.562 line:80%
Where's Hamid?

2192
01:37:27.895 --> 01:37:28.979 line:80%
He left.

2193
01:37:29.354 --> 01:37:30.895 line:80%
- Why did you let him leave?
- He had plans,

2194
01:37:30.979 --> 01:37:33.020 line:80%
and we've got our own plans for tonight.

2195
01:37:53.895 --> 01:38:01.854 line:80%
Why did my dreams fall apart?

2196
01:38:02.937 --> 01:38:11.187 line:80%
Why did my hopes break my heart?

2197
01:38:23.895 --> 01:38:27.187 line:80%
I'd get an education,
join the irrigation department,

2198
01:38:27.854 --> 01:38:30.354 line:80%
and fix the water problem.

2199
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:33.395 line:80%
I worked really hard, Brother.

2200
01:38:34.770 --> 01:38:36.604 line:80%
I even did well on the exams this time.

2201
01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:39.687 line:80%
But my...

2202
01:38:41.395 --> 01:38:42.937 line:80%
My name wasn't on the list.

2203
01:38:43.895 --> 01:38:45.645 line:80%
My name wasn't on the list, Brother.

2204
01:38:53.354 --> 01:38:57.395 line:80%
I'm not as strong as I seem, Ranjan.

2205
01:38:58.812 --> 01:39:01.479 line:80%
I'll fall apart without you.

2206
01:39:12.354 --> 01:39:14.395 line:80%
What have you gotten me into, Mahadev?

2207
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:20.187 line:80%
If I knew doing a good deed
was going to be this hard,

2208
01:39:21.354 --> 01:39:23.229 line:80%
I would've never made that pledge.

2209
01:39:27.812 --> 01:39:31.437 line:80%
Mahadev, what kind of dilemma
have you put my life into?

2210
01:39:33.854 --> 01:39:35.479 line:80%
On one side, there's Titli,

2211
01:39:35.562 --> 01:39:37.062 line:80%
and on the other, Hamid.

2212
01:39:38.895 --> 01:39:40.645 line:80%
What did I do wrong in all of this?

2213
01:39:43.979 --> 01:39:46.229 line:80%
Mahadev, I just loved Titli.

2214
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:50.395 line:80%
I don't want this job, Mahadev!

2215
01:39:51.687 --> 01:39:53.145 line:80%
I just wanted Titli.

2216
01:39:55.729 --> 01:39:57.145 line:80%
You know what,

2217
01:39:58.270 --> 01:40:00.354 line:80%
just take back what You have done

2218
01:40:01.687 --> 01:40:03.812 line:80%
and get me out of this mess, Mahadev.

2219
01:40:04.979 --> 01:40:06.479 line:80%
Please, get me out of this trouble.

2220
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:11.729 line:80%
Har Har Mahadev, Pundit-ji.

2221
01:40:11.812 --> 01:40:14.312 line:80%
Mahadev!

2222
01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.520 line:80%
You're an odd man.

2223
01:40:20.645 --> 01:40:22.812 line:80%
First, you claim Mahadev
doesn't grant your wishes,

2224
01:40:22.895 --> 01:40:25.270 line:80%
but when He does,
you blame Him instead.

2225
01:40:25.645 --> 01:40:27.895 line:80%
What do you seek in life?

2226
01:40:28.604 --> 01:40:30.354 line:80%
Pundit-ji, if I knew that,

2227
01:40:30.437 --> 01:40:32.270 line:80%
I wouldn't be asking Him.

2228
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:34.479 line:80%
Hmm.

2229
01:40:35.062 --> 01:40:37.395 line:80%
My life is at a crossroads, Pundit-ji.

2230
01:40:39.187 --> 01:40:41.020 line:80%
I feel stuck, Pundit-ji.

2231
01:40:42.312 --> 01:40:43.437 line:80%
Son,

2232
01:40:44.895 --> 01:40:47.854 line:80%
when you stand at life's crossroads,

2233
01:40:48.812 --> 01:40:50.645 line:80%
it's hard to make a choice.

2234
01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.645 line:80%
When Arjuna was in a dilemma,

2235
01:40:54.979 --> 01:40:58.312 line:80%
Lord Krishna had to recite
the entire Bhagwat Gita,

2236
01:41:00.104 --> 01:41:01.729 line:80%
and only then did time move forward.

2237
01:41:02.937 --> 01:41:08.562 line:80%
or a single sentence
to help you make sense of it.

2238
01:41:10.395 --> 01:41:13.437 line:80%
Do your good deeds
without expecting a return.

2239
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:22.104 line:80%
Now,
it's up to you to choose what's right.

2240
01:41:24.729 --> 01:41:27.229 line:80%
close your eyes, and with a clear heart

2241
01:41:27.312 --> 01:41:31.145 line:80%
surrender yourself to Mahadev.

2242
01:41:35.604 --> 01:41:39.812 line:80%
Maybe Mahadev is testing you.

2243
01:41:41.770 --> 01:41:44.729 line:80%
Maybe Mahadev is trying
to teach you something.

2244
01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:25.020 line:80%
This is great.

2245
01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:37.520 line:80%
They're all just having Jalebis.
Go offer them some water.

2246
01:42:37.729 --> 01:42:38.937 line:80%
Come here, son.

2247
01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.062 line:80%
Who are you?

2248
01:42:40.145 --> 01:42:41.354 line:80%
I'm Sushil.

2249
01:42:41.437 --> 01:42:43.562 line:80%
- Sushil? Sushil, who?
- The government job guy...?

2250
01:42:43.687 --> 01:42:45.729 line:80%
The one who helped my son
get the government job?

2251
01:42:45.812 --> 01:42:46.895 line:80%
Yeah.

2252
01:42:54.354 --> 01:42:56.562 line:80%
- Hey, how are you? You good?
- I'm fine.

2253
01:42:56.645 --> 01:42:58.145 line:80%
I've been waiting for you.

2254
01:43:06.104 --> 01:43:08.854 line:80%
Have you stopped going to the gym?
Look, you've got a bit of a belly.

2255
01:43:08.937 --> 01:43:11.687 line:80%
Forget mine, look at yours!
You're just...

2256
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:13.229 line:80%
Dad, can you come with me for a minute?
I need to talk about something important.

2257
01:43:13.312 --> 01:43:14.562 line:80%
Why are you nervous?

2258
01:43:14.645 --> 01:43:17.437 line:80%
I was in worse shape than you
when I got married.

2259
01:43:17.729 --> 01:43:19.312 line:80%
- You're right.
- Dad, you don't get it. It's important.

2260
01:43:19.395 --> 01:43:21.020 line:80%
What do you need to talk about?

2261
01:43:21.104 --> 01:43:24.604 line:80%
Son, he gets it, but you don't.

2262
01:43:24.687 --> 01:43:27.895 line:80%
You should talk to your friends
about this, not your dad.

2263
01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:28.812 line:80%
- Yeah.
- You're right, Uncle.

2264
01:43:28.895 --> 01:43:29.979 line:80%
You're absolutely right.

2265
01:43:30.062 --> 01:43:31.770 line:80%
Yeah, son, take him with you
and share your wisdom.

2266
01:43:31.854 --> 01:43:32.520 line:80%
Listen to me.

2267
01:43:32.604 --> 01:43:33.770 line:80%
- Take him away.
- Come on.

2268
01:43:33.854 --> 01:43:35.145 line:80%
- Take him with you.
- Go on.

2269
01:43:35.312 --> 01:43:37.729 line:80%
- You're a weird guy.
- So, where's your bag?

2270
01:43:37.854 --> 01:43:40.479 line:80%
I explained everything to you yesterday,
but you still didn't get it.

2271
01:43:42.062 --> 01:43:43.812 line:80%
Look, what's done is done.

2272
01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.895 line:80%
So now, just let things be, alright?

2273
01:43:48.062 --> 01:43:49.687 line:80%
- This is wrong, Uncle.
- What's wrong?

2274
01:43:50.187 --> 01:43:51.312 line:80%
If not for yourself,

2275
01:43:51.395 --> 01:43:53.020 line:80%
think about Sister-in-law Titli
and your family,

2276
01:43:53.104 --> 01:43:54.354 line:80%
and just stay quiet, please, Brother.

2277
01:43:54.437 --> 01:43:55.479 line:80%
- You...
- Hey!

2278
01:43:55.562 --> 01:43:56.645 line:80%
- Brother!
- Great.

2279
01:43:56.729 --> 01:43:57.354 line:80%
- I've been looking for you.
- When did you arrive?

2280
01:43:57.437 --> 01:43:58.104 line:80%
Thank goodness I found you here.

2281
01:43:58.187 --> 01:43:59.104 line:80%
I need a favor...

2282
01:44:12.062 --> 01:44:16.104 line:80%
Your home is before me, my dearest one,

2283
01:44:16.145 --> 01:44:19.437 line:80%
Your home is before me, my dearest one,

2284
01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.020 line:80%
Yet I search for you under moon and sun.

2285
01:44:24.104 --> 01:44:28.104 line:80%
The fear that someone might stealyou away,

2286
01:44:28.187 --> 01:44:31.395 line:80%
The fear that someone might stealyou away,

2287
01:44:31.479 --> 01:44:35.270 line:80%
Keeps hauntingmy heart every single day.

2288
01:44:35.354 --> 01:44:39.812 line:80%
Keeps hauntingmy heart every single day.

2289
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:42.187 line:80%
No one else makes my heart race,

2290
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:44.229 line:80%
You're the only soul I worshipand embrace.

2291
01:44:44.312 --> 01:44:46.645 line:80%
Love isn't somethingI understand well,

2292
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:48.104 line:80%
So take me out of this aching spell.

2293
01:44:48.187 --> 01:44:51.395 line:80%
Oh, my beloved!

2294
01:44:51.937 --> 01:44:55.270 line:80%
Oh, my beloved!

2295
01:44:55.895 --> 01:44:59.187 line:80%
Oh, my beloved!

2296
01:44:59.937 --> 01:45:03.229 line:80%
Oh, my beloved!

2297
01:45:04.104 --> 01:45:08.104 line:80%
Your home is before me,my dearest one,

2298
01:45:08.187 --> 01:45:11.395 line:80%
Your home is before me,my dearest one,

2299
01:45:11.479 --> 01:45:15.270 line:80%
Yet I search for you under moon and sun.

2300
01:45:16.104 --> 01:45:20.062 line:80%
The fear that someone might stealyou away,

2301
01:45:20.145 --> 01:45:23.437 line:80%
The fear that someone might stealyou away,

2302
01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:27.229 line:80%
Keeps hauntingmy heart every single day.

2303
01:45:27.312 --> 01:45:31.687 line:80%
Keeps hauntingmy heart every single day.

2304
01:45:42.937 --> 01:45:43.895 line:80%
No...

2305
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:45.562 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

2306
01:45:50.937 --> 01:45:51.979 line:80%
You want me to dance, right?

2307
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:53.104 line:80%
Play it.

2308
01:45:53.729 --> 01:45:54.645 line:80%
Come on, play it!

2309
01:46:40.937 --> 01:46:42.812 line:80%
I can't go through with this wedding.

2310
01:46:43.437 --> 01:46:44.395 line:80%
Huh?

2311
01:46:46.104 --> 01:46:47.520 line:80%
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

2312
01:46:47.604 --> 01:46:48.562 line:80%
- What happened?
- Sister-in-law?

2313
01:46:48.645 --> 01:46:49.895 line:80%
- Someone get her some water.
- Mom?

2314
01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:50.937 line:80%
What happened, huh?

2315
01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:52.104 line:80%
Mom!

2316
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:06.895 line:80%
Go and get that job back! Go!

2317
01:47:08.604 --> 01:47:10.312 line:80%
- Dad...
- Your dad is dead to you!

2318
01:47:10.562 --> 01:47:12.937 line:80%
If not for your honor,
at least think about our honor.

2319
01:47:13.187 --> 01:47:14.645 line:80%
Who gives up such a job?

2320
01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:16.104 line:80%
What happened?

2321
01:47:16.187 --> 01:47:18.104 line:80%
What happened, huh?
Ask him what happened!

2322
01:47:18.479 --> 01:47:22.812 line:80%
I worked hard selling pickles
to build this reputation,

2323
01:47:23.395 --> 01:47:25.145 line:80%
and he just ruined it.

2324
01:47:25.437 --> 01:47:26.354 line:80%
Hey...

2325
01:47:26.979 --> 01:47:28.687 line:80%
What happened, Ranjan?

2326
01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.104 line:80%
What's he going to say?

2327
01:47:30.437 --> 01:47:31.729 line:80%
He gave up the job.

2328
01:47:32.062 --> 01:47:33.604 line:80%
He gave it to some Hamid Ansari.

2329
01:47:34.312 --> 01:47:36.062 line:80%
You gave up your job?

2330
01:47:38.145 --> 01:47:39.437 line:80%
Titli, Hamid is the one
who really deserves it.

2331
01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.354 line:80%
Who's this Hamid?

2332
01:47:40.937 --> 01:47:42.770 line:80%
Go get your job back.

2333
01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:45.062 line:80%
Dad...

2334
01:47:47.062 --> 01:47:48.854 line:80%
I can't get it back, Titli.

2335
01:47:50.729 --> 01:47:52.854 line:80%
And I can't lie and go through
with this wedding either.

2336
01:47:54.812 --> 01:47:57.895 line:80%
Titli, I did what I thought was right.

2337
01:47:58.562 --> 01:47:59.854 line:80%
What was right?

2338
01:48:01.354 --> 01:48:02.979 line:80%
What you thought was right?

2339
01:48:04.145 --> 01:48:06.562 line:80%
What did you think
was the right thing to do, huh?

2340
01:48:07.145 --> 01:48:09.562 line:80%
I lied and got beaten up for you.

2341
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:11.937 line:80%
I even went to the police station for you.

2342
01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:13.354 line:80%
What haven't I done for you?

2343
01:48:16.895 --> 01:48:19.354 line:80%
I even mortgaged my mom's necklace

2344
01:48:19.479 --> 01:48:21.270 line:80%
so you could get that job,

2345
01:48:21.354 --> 01:48:23.020 line:80%
and we could get married.

2346
01:48:25.312 --> 01:48:26.437 line:80%
And you...

2347
01:48:26.645 --> 01:48:28.104 line:80%
you gave up that job.

2348
01:48:30.354 --> 01:48:31.979 line:80%
- Listen...
- Let go of me.

2349
01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.229 line:80%
tell me the truth,

2350
01:48:35.395 --> 01:48:37.520 line:80%
did you even want to marry me?

2351
01:48:38.062 --> 01:48:39.104 line:80%
- Titli...
- Yes?

2352
01:48:40.937 --> 01:48:41.770 line:80%
If...

2353
01:48:42.937 --> 01:48:45.020 line:80%
if you didn't,

2354
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:47.145 line:80%
you should've told me earlier.

2355
01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.187 line:80%
You wouldn't have had to put on this
whole drama in front of everyone for me.

2356
01:48:51.062 --> 01:48:54.479 line:80%
At least my parents wouldn't have
been embarrassed in front of everyone.

2357
01:48:58.312 --> 01:48:59.604 line:80%
Look, Sister,

2358
01:48:59.687 --> 01:49:02.395 line:80%
I applied henna yesterday with an R
on one hand and a T on the other.

2359
01:49:02.479 --> 01:49:03.770 line:80%
Why did I even bother?

2360
01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:05.354 line:80%
Why are you crying?

2361
01:49:07.229 --> 01:49:08.979 line:80%
They'll be the ones crying now.

2362
01:49:10.187 --> 01:49:11.770 line:80%
Leave, there's no wedding
happening here today.

2363
01:49:11.854 --> 01:49:12.812 line:80%
- Leave.
- Dad...

2364
01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.062 line:80%
And you...

2365
01:49:17.062 --> 01:49:18.854 line:80%
I knew you were good-for-nothing,

2366
01:49:19.937 --> 01:49:22.437 line:80%
but I didn't know you were THIS stupid.

2367
01:49:23.937 --> 01:49:24.937 line:80%
Leave!

2368
01:49:25.354 --> 01:49:27.687 line:80%
Dad, I told you,
he's not the right guy for Titli.

2369
01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:28.979 line:80%
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

2370
01:49:29.145 --> 01:49:30.812 line:80%
What you did to Titli wasn't right.

2371
01:49:31.437 --> 01:49:33.854 line:80%
I worked so hard to get him
that government job,

2372
01:49:33.937 --> 01:49:35.562 line:80%
and he went and gave it to someone else.

2373
01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:39.520 line:80%
Brother, you've ruined
everything you worked so hard for.

2374
01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.062 line:80%
You're a strange guy.

2375
01:49:42.604 --> 01:49:44.687 line:80%
You dug a well in your own house

2376
01:49:44.770 --> 01:49:46.562 line:80%
and ruined it just to help someone else.

2377
01:49:48.312 --> 01:49:50.104 line:80%
You're totally right, Uncle!

2378
01:49:51.187 --> 01:49:52.937 line:80%
Good going, good going.

2379
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.812 line:80%
Why stop at a well?
Tell him to dig a pond!

2380
01:49:54.895 --> 01:49:55.812 line:80%
Hold this, dear.

2381
01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:57.645 line:80%
Are we done taunting him,

2382
01:49:57.812 --> 01:49:59.979 line:80%
or does anyone else have something to say?

2383
01:50:00.562 --> 01:50:01.604 line:80%
"Who are you?"

2384
01:50:01.687 --> 01:50:02.812 line:80%
Ma'am,

2385
01:50:03.854 --> 01:50:08.479 line:80%
I'm the one who got this great
guy the government job.

2386
01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.604 line:80%
But he gave it up!

2387
01:50:11.729 --> 01:50:13.270 line:80%
Exactly!

2388
01:50:13.354 --> 01:50:14.437 line:80%
He gave it up!

2389
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:17.354 line:80%
You went down
and dragged me down with you.

2390
01:50:17.979 --> 01:50:19.104 line:80%
Why did you do it?

2391
01:50:19.187 --> 01:50:20.812 line:80%
If someone's dying, just let them die.

2392
01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:22.604 line:80%
You should've just gone ahead
and gotten married.

2393
01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.645 line:80%
I can't get married
over someone's dead body.

2394
01:50:25.770 --> 01:50:27.395 line:80%
He says he can't get married!

2395
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.979 line:80%
Why? What's the problem?

2396
01:50:30.354 --> 01:50:31.354 line:80%
You're a strange guy.

2397
01:50:31.437 --> 01:50:32.979 line:80%
Brother, you look smart to me.

2398
01:50:33.062 --> 01:50:34.312 line:80%
Tell me,

2399
01:50:34.395 --> 01:50:37.395 line:80%
how can someone stay hungry
and feed others?

2400
01:50:37.479 --> 01:50:38.812 line:80%
This guy...
someone talk some sense into him.

2401
01:50:38.895 --> 01:50:39.937 line:80%
Right.

2402
01:50:40.437 --> 01:50:43.062 line:80%
Thousands of people get jobs
every day using unfair means.

2403
01:50:43.145 --> 01:50:44.479 line:80%
Exactly.

2404
01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:47.020 line:80%
Hundreds of Hamids die every day too.

2405
01:50:47.437 --> 01:50:49.062 line:80%
What can you or I do about that, right?

2406
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:54.020 line:80%
There's no water in the village,
there's a shortage -

2407
01:50:54.104 --> 01:50:55.645 line:80%
does that mean we should stop bathing?

2408
01:50:57.104 --> 01:50:59.979 line:80%
There's a drought somewhere,
floods somewhere else.

2409
01:51:00.062 --> 01:51:01.187 line:80%
Everything gets ruined.

2410
01:51:01.312 --> 01:51:03.145 line:80%
Does that mean we should
stop being happy?

2411
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:04.354 line:80%
No, right?

2412
01:51:05.062 --> 01:51:06.479 line:80%
Someone talk some sense into him,

2413
01:51:07.104 --> 01:51:08.770 line:80%
that a man takes a government job

2414
01:51:08.854 --> 01:51:11.145 line:80%
to build his future,

2415
01:51:11.729 --> 01:51:13.020 line:80%
not for others.

2416
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:17.812 line:80%
I agree this country needs
another Bhagat Singh.

2417
01:51:17.895 --> 01:51:18.854 line:80%
Yes, ma'am, we do.

2418
01:51:18.937 --> 01:51:21.854 line:80%
But does that mean
we should send our only son

2419
01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:24.187 line:80%
to sacrifice himself for his country,
for society?

2420
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:26.854 line:80%
And which society? This one?

2421
01:51:29.645 --> 01:51:30.937 line:80%
This society?

2422
01:51:32.812 --> 01:51:36.062 line:80%
Where everyone just looks
out for themselves?

2423
01:51:39.479 --> 01:51:41.729 line:80%
No one cares about others.

2424
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:47.812 line:80%
You're the only one...

2425
01:51:49.854 --> 01:51:51.854 line:80%
thinking about others.

2426
01:51:55.770 --> 01:51:57.895 line:80%
That's why they don't like you.

2427
01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:01.895 line:80%
That's why you're different
from everyone else.

2428
01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:09.729 line:80%
Son, I've helped many get jobs,

2429
01:52:10.937 --> 01:52:13.645 line:80%
but I've never been as happy
about anyone getting a job

2430
01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:18.562 line:80%
as I am that you gave yours up.

2431
01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:25.729 line:80%
It's hard to do what's right.

2432
01:52:27.562 --> 01:52:29.187 line:80%
Even the best ones have made mistakes.

2433
01:52:31.562 --> 01:52:33.479 line:80%
You didn't just save Hamid,

2434
01:52:33.812 --> 01:52:39.020 line:80%
you saved humanity from drowning.

2435
01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:50.354 line:80%
I expect that whether you
do the right thing or not,

2436
01:52:52.395 --> 01:52:56.187 line:80%
at least support those who do.

2437
01:53:00.145 --> 01:53:03.520 line:80%
You can at least appreciate it, right?

2438
01:53:06.604 --> 01:53:09.312 line:80%
As for the rest,
you're all educated and smart enough.

2439
01:53:13.479 --> 01:53:15.312 line:80%
If I've overstepped or said too much,

2440
01:53:15.729 --> 01:53:17.270 line:80%
please forgive me.

2441
01:53:26.645 --> 01:53:29.520 line:80%
Look, dear, you won't have
trouble finding another partner,

2442
01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:33.312 line:80%
but an honest one

2443
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:36.812 line:80%
is hard to come by.

2444
01:53:37.312 --> 01:53:38.479 line:80%
As they say

2445
01:53:38.812 --> 01:53:40.687 line:80%
marriages are made in heaven.

2446
01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.479 line:80%
I know I've hurt everyone's feelings here.

2447
01:54:19.312 --> 01:54:20.770 line:80%
But I can't take someone's life

2448
01:54:22.604 --> 01:54:24.354 line:80%
just to create a new life for myself.

2449
01:54:28.145 --> 01:54:29.395 line:80%
I'll take my leave now.

2450
01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:31.645 line:80%
How can you just walk away like that?

2451
01:54:33.395 --> 01:54:35.562 line:80%
What about all the money
we spent on the wedding?

2452
01:54:44.687 --> 01:54:46.104 line:80%
You're getting married, no matter what.

2453
01:54:49.104 --> 01:54:50.062 line:80%
Dad?

2454
01:54:50.479 --> 01:54:51.479 line:80%
Exactly.

2455
01:54:54.895 --> 01:54:56.479 line:80%
If you back out now,

2456
01:54:58.270 --> 01:55:00.687 line:80%
I swear I'll immerse your remains
in the sacred waters of the Ganges.

2457
01:55:03.395 --> 01:55:04.895 line:80%
Mr. Pandey!

2458
01:55:04.979 --> 01:55:07.895 line:80%
Start serving the guests, will you?
Everyone's hungry.

2459
01:55:07.979 --> 01:55:09.729 line:80%
Where's the band? Where's the drummer?

2460
01:55:09.812 --> 01:55:11.062 line:80%
Come on, let's get the music going.

2461
01:55:11.145 --> 01:55:15.479 line:80%
Sweep you away in a wedding attire.

2462
01:55:22.687 --> 01:55:24.937 line:80%
Just around the bend,

2463
01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.729 line:80%
The sights are just beautiful.

2464
01:55:26.812 --> 01:55:28.020 line:80%
Since my outlook has changed.

2465
01:55:28.104 --> 01:55:29.562 line:80%
I remember hearing that verse
from the Bhagavad Gita:

2466
01:55:29.687 --> 01:55:32.104 line:80%
"Do your good deeds
without expecting anything in return."

2467
01:55:32.187 --> 01:55:33.395 line:80%
And today, I actually saw that in action.

2468
01:55:33.687 --> 01:55:34.562 line:80%
As for the rest...

2469
01:55:34.645 --> 01:55:36.979 line:80%
The thirst of the sea is quenched.

2470
01:55:37.062 --> 01:55:39.479 line:80%
The entire city's going to sway,

2471
01:55:39.562 --> 01:55:41.270 line:80%
as this news of joy spreads far and wide.

2472
01:55:41.354 --> 01:55:44.437 line:80%
I am going to be your beloved.

2473
01:56:19.937 --> 01:56:22.229 line:80%
That old mischief in our eyes,

2474
01:56:22.312 --> 01:56:24.854 line:80%
Was once a habit, now it's gone.

2475
01:56:29.354 --> 01:56:31.687 line:80%
The love we shared

2476
01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:34.229 line:80%
had reached its time,

2477
01:56:38.770 --> 01:56:41.062 line:80%
You are still you, I'm still me,

2478
01:56:41.145 --> 01:56:43.479 line:80%
But the world's turned upside-down,you see.

2479
01:56:43.562 --> 01:56:47.979 line:80%
Neither you nor I quite know,how everything just changed so.

2480
01:56:48.062 --> 01:56:50.479 line:80%
This twist was bound to happen.

2481
01:56:50.562 --> 01:56:53.104 line:80%
And now it's come to pass at last.

2482
01:56:57.145 --> 01:56:59.854 line:80%
That old mischief in our eyes,

2483
01:56:59.937 --> 01:57:02.312 line:80%
Was once a habit, now it's gone.

2484
01:57:02.395 --> 01:57:07.062 line:80%
My heart sways...wildly...

2485
01:57:07.145 --> 01:57:10.979 line:80%
My body sways...wildly...

2486
01:57:11.062 --> 01:57:13.104 line:80%
She makes my heart beat.

2487
01:57:13.187 --> 01:57:15.437 line:80%
There is no one else I like.

2488
01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:18.520 line:80%
I swear, I will win the game,

2489
01:57:18.604 --> 01:57:20.562 line:80%
If she just looks into my eyes

2490
01:57:20.645 --> 01:57:22.979 line:80%
Praising you,

2491
01:57:23.062 --> 01:57:25.270 line:80%
fearing I'd lose you,

2492
01:57:25.354 --> 01:57:29.687 line:80%
I forgot how I once usedto fall you four times a day

2493
01:57:29.812 --> 01:57:32.312 line:80%
Praising you,

2494
01:57:32.437 --> 01:57:34.645 line:80%
fearing I'd lose you,

2495
01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:39.437 line:80%
I forgot how I once usedto fall you four times a day

2496
01:57:39.812 --> 01:57:44.520 line:80%
The high of love is all worn out,even sweet talk's lost its shout.

2497
01:57:44.604 --> 01:57:49.229 line:80%
From "us" to "me," we switched so soon.All I could hear was me.

2498
01:57:49.312 --> 01:57:51.687 line:80%
Two had once become just one,

2499
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:54.354 line:80%
now our paths are divided.

2500
01:57:58.354 --> 01:58:01.062 line:80%
That old mischief in our eyes,

2501
01:58:01.145 --> 01:58:03.812 line:80%
Was once a habit, now it's gone.
