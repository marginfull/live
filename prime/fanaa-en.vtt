00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:48.586 line:82%
Better than all the world

2
00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:53.132 line:82%
Is our India

3
00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.011 line:82%
Better than all the world

4
00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:01.765 line:82%
Is our India

5
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.020 line:82%
We are its nightingales

6
00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:10.649 line:82%
And this is our garden

7
00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:14.528 line:82%
Better than all the world

8
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.489 line:82%
Is our India

9
00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:18.574 line:82%
This way.

10
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.837 line:82%
Our present decides our future.

11
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.967 line:82%
The decisions that we make todaydecide our future.

12
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:40.846 line:82%
It's very easy to choose
between right and wrong.

13
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.767 line:82%
But to choose the better of two goods,

14
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.144 line:82%
or the lesser of two evils,

15
00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:50.314 line:82%
these choices decide our lives.

16
00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:54.485 line:82%
Now, what you choose is up to you, Zooni.

17
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.488 line:82%
Oh, leave my little girl alone.

18
00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:02.576 line:82%
Zooni, just listen to your heart, dear,
and not your father's philosophy.

19
00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:05.371 line:82%
In life, sometimes you have to try
to follow your heart,

20
00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:07.373 line:82%
and not your brain, Zulfi.

21
00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:10.709 line:82%
Had I used my brain, my beloved wife,

22
00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:13.045 line:82%
then you wouldn't have been here today.

23
00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:16.131 line:82%
So, Zooni?

24
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.717 line:82%
Dad, Mom.

25
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.056 line:82%
I really can't decide.
I will do whatever you say.

26
00:04:28.394 --> 00:04:30.646 line:82%
So that's it. It has been decided.

27
00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.731 line:82%
Zooni will not go to Delhi.

28
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.737 line:82%
I found my soulmate.

29
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:41.782 line:82%
But when will Zooni find hers?

30
00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:46.495 line:82%
When will some football player
hit her head with a ball?

31
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.540 line:82%
-Any regrets?
-Regrets?

32
00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.835 line:82%
I praise God every day,

33
00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:55.004 line:82%
that the penalty kick
of the great football player,

34
00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:56.839 line:82%
Zulfikar Ali Beg,

35
00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:59.550 line:82%
missed the goal
and hit me square on the head.

36
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:02.511 line:82%
It was my worst kick ever.

37
00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.972 line:82%
-Any regrets?
-Regrets?

38
00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:09.935 line:82%
That's why I tended to you
in the hospital for a week.

39
00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:15.899 line:82%
My love, how long we will be thinking

40
00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.111 line:82%
that she may have to live her life
without that special someone?

41
00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:21.530 line:82%
That, perhaps, she would never marry?

42
00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:26.201 line:82%
And when we're gone,

43
00:05:27.036 --> 00:05:29.538 line:82%
who will take care of our Zooni?

44
00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:32.541 line:82%
She has to take care of herself.

45
00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:37.046 line:82%
We must give her a chance
to live her life.

46
00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:41.967 line:82%
We should be her strength,
not her weakness.

47
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.822 line:82%
Madam Mehbooba!

48
00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.160 line:82%
Whatever you command, Your Highness.

49
00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:11.371 line:82%
By the way,
your bags weigh more than your brain.

50
00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:14.208 line:82%
Obviously! Haven't you heard that saying?

51
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:17.169 line:82%
-Which one?
-"The buffalo is bigger than the brain."

52
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.588 line:82%
No, Bobo, it's "Is the brain bigger
or the buffalo?"

53
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.673 line:82%
-Fatty!
-Not Fatty, it's Fatima.

54
00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:24.218 line:82%
Why do you distort perfectly good names?

55
00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:27.721 line:82%
Not Ruby, it's Rubina!

56
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.348 line:82%
Come on, take the bags at least!

57
00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:31.391 line:82%
You were kept alone with the bags...

58
00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:39.733 line:82%
I have to represent my state
at the Republic Day performance

59
00:06:39.817 --> 00:06:42.111 line:82%
at the President's Palace,

60
00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:45.781 line:82%
in front of the Chief Minister of Delhi,
and what do I have to pull this off?

61
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.407 line:82%
A bunch of wild cats!

62
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.120 line:82%
If we're a bunch of wild cats,
what does that make our leader?

63
00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:54.665 line:82%
Who said that?

64
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.126 line:82%
Have you brought your knitting materials?

65
00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:01.171 line:82%
When we're upset, we say these things
to distract us, right?

66
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:02.422 line:82%
"Have you brought
your knitting materials?"

67
00:07:02.506 --> 00:07:05.509 line:82%
"Keep your ticket safe."
"Don't get off at a station on the way."

68
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.553 line:82%
-God keep you safe, children.
-Dad?

69
00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:09.096 line:82%
Dad!

70
00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:12.766 line:82%
When Dad's upset,

71
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.936 line:82%
it's not just his voice,
but his walking style also changes.

72
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.020 line:82%
Yes.

73
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:20.649 line:82%
And he can't even cry
in front of all these girls.

74
00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:24.945 line:82%
But I don't have such problem.

75
00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:27.322 line:82%
Mom!

76
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.120 line:82%
Dear, I knew that one day,
you would get to do this.

77
00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:36.915 line:82%
But, I don't know why I'm afraid.

78
00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:40.127 line:82%
Afraid of what? Losing me to some prince?

79
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.547 line:82%
Oh, I wish! One look at you,
and he will be on his knees.

80
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.175 line:82%
Heaven forbid! Will he be a porter?
He would kneel to get my bags?

81
00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:48.677 line:82%
Quiet! Not a porter, not your bags.

82
00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:51.013 line:82%
He will take your heart away.

83
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.390 line:82%
With some poetry, maybe.

84
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.268 line:82%
"Every once in a while,
I get this feeling in my heart

85
00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:59.980 line:82%
that you were made for me."

86
00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.941 line:82%
"All this while, you were living
in the mountains somewhere."

87
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:04.026 line:82%
Yes!

88
00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.653 line:82%
-"You have been called down to earth,
-"You have been called down to earth,

89
00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:07.779 line:82%
-only for me."
-only for me."

90
00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.534 line:82%
Okay, bye.

91
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.123 line:82%
-God keep you safe, my child.
-God keep you safe, Mom.

92
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.460 line:82%
God keep you safe! Bye.

93
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:24.463 line:82%
Be sure to say a prayer for me
at the Jama Masjid.

94
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.547 line:82%
-Yes, Mom.
-And you,

95
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:27.174 line:82%
remind Zooni to go for an eye checkup.

96
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.051 line:82%
And you, Rubina, take care of my baby!

97
00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.469 line:82%
-Relax, ma'am.
-Relax, ma'am.

98
00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.262 line:82%
Don't worry, I'm here, aren't I?

99
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:35.307 line:82%
-That's what I'm afraid of, Fatima.
-It's Fatty, ma'am.

100
00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.601 line:82%
Bye, dear. Bye, Zooni!

101
00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:43.315 line:82%
Mom!

102
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:45.692 line:82%
-Mom!
-Yes, Zooni!

103
00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.528 line:82%
If the prince recites poetry,
what should I say?

104
00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:53.325 line:82%
"May my life's breath find refuge
in your heart.

105
00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:56.578 line:82%
Destroyed in your love,
may my life depart!"

106
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.582 line:82%
Bye, Mom!

107
00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.125 line:82%
Why do you do this?

108
00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.711 line:82%
You can say something as well.

109
00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:24.606 line:82%
Rao!

110
00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.775 line:82%
Oh my, god. Coming, madam!

111
00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:27.859 line:82%
Rao!

112
00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:30.445 line:82%
Garbage everywhere. Idiot!

113
00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.907 line:82%
Lord Venkateshwa Rao
at your service, madam.

114
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.119 line:82%
We're here just for seven days.
It's five days for the show,

115
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.954 line:82%
-then we will stay for two more days.
-Very good.

116
00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.914 line:82%
-I want to enjoy Delhi for five days.
-Okay.

117
00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:42.958 line:82%
Not your bald head. Stand straight.

118
00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:45.502 line:82%
I'm not even a man anymore, madam.

119
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:49.256 line:82%
The thing is, years of bowing
to government officers made me like this.

120
00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.009 line:82%
I think, if I have children,
even they will be born bent over.

121
00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:55.887 line:82%
I have no interest
in your family planning program!

122
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:57.097 line:82%
Where is that tour guide?

123
00:10:04.563 --> 00:10:07.649 line:82%
I am Balwaan, ma'am.

124
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.528 line:82%
You are exactly what you look like.

125
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.030 line:82%
Now tell me, what's the problem here?

126
00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:15.115 line:82%
Where do I start?

127
00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:18.493 line:82%
From the headlights to the exhaust,
problem is everywhere.

128
00:10:22.164 --> 00:10:23.165 line:82%
No need to mention.

129
00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:26.043 line:82%
I mean, your tour guide didn't come,
where is he?

130
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.795 line:82%
"Don't look around the city,
forget the wasteland, too.

131
00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:33.550 line:82%
Don't look around the city,
forget the wasteland, too.

132
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:36.553 line:82%
Behold God's greatest creation.

133
00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:39.681 line:82%
Just look up and see Rehan."

134
00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.017 line:82%
Rehan.

135
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.689 line:82%
Rehan... Rehan Khan.

136
00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:54.821 line:82%
You, Mr. Romeo, stop this cheap poetry!

137
00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:57.616 line:82%
Come on, let's go, girls.

138
00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:03.413 line:82%
You didn't applaud me,
now at least help me.

139
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.500 line:82%
Oh, are you blind?

140
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.335 line:82%
Yes, you didn't see that?

141
00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.544 line:82%
Are you blind, too?

142
00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.257 line:82%
Thank God, I'm not.

143
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.677 line:82%
That's a nice thing to say
to a blind person.

144
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.304 line:82%
If I were blind,

145
00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.265 line:82%
I couldn't have seen
the most beautiful thing in the world.

146
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.351 line:82%
You.

147
00:11:27.229 --> 00:11:29.815 line:82%
"Your beauty made God make a mistake,

148
00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.068 line:82%
so that you don't cast
an evil eye on yourself,

149
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.486 line:82%
he took your eyes away."

150
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.159 line:82%
-Zooni, where are you?
-I'm coming, Fatty.

151
00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:44.121 line:82%
Fatty? Is that your name or your dog's?

152
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.917 line:82%
Come on, Balwante.
Passengers are ready. Hit the first gear.

153
00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:00.554 line:82%
We will get erased and die

154
00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.224 line:82%
But will do some deed

155
00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:20.907 line:82%
Heavenly!

156
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.086 line:82%
"If I wish, I was a roll of wool.

157
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.008 line:82%
How I wish, I was a roll of wool

158
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.968 line:82%
and wrapped around her fingers."

159
00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.765 line:82%
If you were a roll of wool,
then with the needles, I would...

160
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.976 line:82%
I wish she would make a sweater out of me,

161
00:12:48.477 --> 00:12:49.936 line:82%
and wear me even in the summer.

162
00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:52.439 line:82%
What a thought!

163
00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:53.565 line:82%
Very nice!

164
00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:58.320 line:82%
Zooni, stop encouraging his nonsense.

165
00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:01.865 line:82%
"I am a Rose, don't mistake me as Jasmine.

166
00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:06.161 line:82%
I am a Rose, don't mistake me as Jasmine.

167
00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.832 line:82%
I am your lifelong admirer,
don't mistake me for your friend's"

168
00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.420 line:82%
-Nice one, boss.
-Hey, Mr. Guide,

169
00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:17.964 line:82%
your cheap poetry
is going to get you nowhere.

170
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:20.300 line:82%
So, who are you knitting this sweater for?

171
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:24.137 line:82%
She's knitting it for a prince,
not for a devil like you.

172
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:26.723 line:82%
And if she were interested in you,
she would speak up,

173
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.058 line:82%
and not sit quietly.

174
00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:29.643 line:82%
Oh, so she does speak?

175
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.937 line:82%
I thought she was blind and mute too.

176
00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.356 line:82%
Zooni!

177
00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:37.442 line:82%
Don't talk to him,
you don't know these men.

178
00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:39.611 line:82%
Looks like you know men very well?

179
00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:41.655 line:82%
Stupid guide.

180
00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.327 line:82%
"Sitting there, keeping her lips silenced,

181
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.496 line:82%
you will regret it.

182
00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:54.167 line:82%
So often after silence,
love has awakened, stronger still."

183
00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:55.377 line:82%
Amazing!

184
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:57.879 line:82%
Bobo!

185
00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.506 line:82%
Tommy!

186
00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.637 line:82%
"There is no limit to human desire.

187
00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:09.015 line:82%
There is no limit to human desire.

188
00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:13.353 line:82%
After two yards of burial cloth,
we still want two yards of earth."

189
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.274 line:82%
-Amazing, Zooni! That was superb!
-Amazing! Heavenly! Superb!

190
00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.485 line:82%
Now you say something.

191
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:24.948 line:82%
"I will suffer pain for you,
I can face any risk for you.

192
00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:27.826 line:82%
For the sake of your friendship,
my friend,

193
00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.620 line:82%
I would even love my enemy."

194
00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.920 line:82%
Oh, yeah, I love your style!

195
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:41.840 line:82%
The emperor, Shah Jahan,

196
00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.550 line:82%
once walked through these lanes
of the Red Fort.

197
00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.803 line:82%
And so did Mumtaz, heavenly!

198
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.722 line:82%
His very beautiful wife.

199
00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:52.934 line:82%
There are stairs!

200
00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:56.229 line:82%
I can manage myself.

201
00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:58.064 line:82%
But how will I manage myself around you?

202
00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:00.650 line:82%
Bobo!

203
00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:05.071 line:82%
Shall we?

204
00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.538 line:82%
Bobo, tell me, how does he look like?

205
00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:14.789 line:82%
Who, Rehan?

206
00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:17.751 line:82%
Killer, my girl! A real killer.

207
00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.432 line:82%
He's simply obnoxious!

208
00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.935 line:82%
He looks okay,
so I thought he must be a nice guy,

209
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.438 line:82%
but he called me a stupid girl.

210
00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:40.982 line:82%
And forget all his sweet talk.

211
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.652 line:82%
The way he looks at women, it's shameful!

212
00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.988 line:82%
And he told me he doesn't believe in God.
Can you believe that?

213
00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:51.034 line:82%
Look, even the crows are cawing,
"Stay away from that guide, Rehan."

214
00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.828 line:82%
"How would you go away from me?

215
00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:58.208 line:82%
How would your heart forget me?

216
00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.670 line:82%
I'm the fragrance of your breath.

217
00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:05.840 line:82%
How will you stop your breath?"

218
00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.680 line:82%
-Unbelievable!
-Come on, let's go.

219
00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:32.450 line:82%
Heavenly

220
00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:36.162 line:82%
Heavenly

221
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:40.125 line:82%
Heavenly

222
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:45.380 line:82%
Heavenly

223
00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:12.657 line:82%
If the moon was to recommend me

224
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.577 line:82%
This is what he'd say to you

225
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:20.498 line:82%
I want to drop the veil of decency

226
00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.585 line:82%
I want to cross the line with you

227
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:28.381 line:82%
I insist on destroying myself

228
00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:31.801 line:82%
On destroying myself in you

229
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:36.389 line:82%
If the moon was to recommend me

230
00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:39.184 line:82%
This is what he'd say to you

231
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:44.189 line:82%
I want to drop the veil of decency

232
00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:47.233 line:82%
I want to cross the line with you

233
00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:15.595 line:82%
Your charms are like a gentle breeze

234
00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:18.556 line:82%
Let them touch me as you pass

235
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.394 line:82%
Your every move is a graceful branch

236
00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:26.898 line:82%
Let it move into my heart

237
00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:31.528 line:82%
Come into my arms, making any excuse

238
00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.531 line:82%
I must destroy myself in you

239
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.244 line:82%
If the moon was to recommend me

240
00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.163 line:82%
This is what he'd say to you

241
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:47.418 line:82%
I want to drop the veil of decency

242
00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:50.505 line:82%
I want to cross the line with you

243
00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:21.828 line:82%
Heavenly

244
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:25.665 line:82%
Heavenly

245
00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:29.669 line:82%
Heavenly

246
00:19:29.752 --> 00:19:34.007 line:82%
Heavenly

247
00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:38.136 line:82%
If I tell you my true intentions

248
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:41.055 line:82%
I'm sure they'll make you blush

249
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:46.185 line:82%
If I make you hear my heartbeats

250
00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:49.022 line:82%
I'm sure they'll leave you flushed

251
00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:54.235 line:82%
But I cannot hide my true feelings

252
00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:57.614 line:82%
I must destroy myself in you

253
00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:01.951 line:82%
If the moon was to recommend me

254
00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.954 line:82%
This is what he'd say to you

255
00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:09.834 line:82%
I want to drop the veil of decency

256
00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:12.879 line:82%
I want to cross the line with you

257
00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:17.675 line:82%
I insist on destroying myself

258
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.971 line:82%
On destroying myself in you

259
00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:44.577 line:82%
Hey Rao, stand straight.

260
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:47.497 line:82%
Looking at your back,
I'm getting a back pain as well.

261
00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.126 line:82%
We have to leave for rehearsal
at exactly 9:00 a.m., tomorrow.

262
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.211 line:82%
So, leave.

263
00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.677 line:82%
It's me, Rehan.

264
00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:03.596 line:82%
I know.

265
00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:06.391 line:82%
Only you can be so bold.

266
00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:10.019 line:82%
I want to be even more frank.

267
00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:15.942 line:82%
I want you to run away with me.

268
00:21:19.737 --> 00:21:22.991 line:82%
I want to show you Delhi, alone.

269
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.244 line:82%
Without your gang of bodyguards.

270
00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:29.163 line:82%
Don't say no,

271
00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:31.582 line:82%
not without thinking about it at least.

272
00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:36.170 line:82%
And you will definitely think about me.

273
00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.010 line:82%
God forbid, the crows are cawing.

274
00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.143 line:82%
I will wait for you tomorrow
after the rehearsal,

275
00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.270 line:82%
with these crows.

276
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:05.366 line:82%
You have had more girls in your life
than the mileage of my bus.

277
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:07.910 line:82%
Now, why are you behind this blind girl?

278
00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:11.831 line:82%
What can I do Balwante?

279
00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:14.292 line:82%
Everyone desires for the moon.

280
00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:18.296 line:82%
There's only one headlight in the sky
which shows us the way.

281
00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:20.506 line:82%
Now, you want that too?

282
00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:24.052 line:82%
They say, you always lose sleep in love.

283
00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.305 line:82%
I wish someone would love me.

284
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:30.683 line:82%
I feel very sleepy.

285
00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:34.062 line:82%
Let's go.

286
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:41.986 line:82%
Zooni, you must be tired, go to sleep.

287
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:45.490 line:82%
I am awake after so many years.

288
00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:48.493 line:82%
I can't sleep now.

289
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.246 line:82%
I can't sleep now.

290
00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:00.671 line:82%
I want to be even more frank.

291
00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:03.299 line:82%
I want you to run away with me.

292
00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:06.010 line:82%
Zooni, where is your concentration?

293
00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:08.096 line:82%
Bobo, can I borrow your phone?

294
00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.853 line:82%
Pick up, Mom!

295
00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:23.361 line:82%
I think, I have to make this decision
by myself.

296
00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:27.573 line:82%
Oh, lord, how silly of me.

297
00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:31.452 line:82%
Of course, there's no point in you
going sightseeing when you can't see.

298
00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:37.917 line:82%
Okay, you can go back
to the guest house after rehearsal.

299
00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:44.924 line:82%
At least you will be away
from that guide, Rehan.

300
00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:53.141 line:82%
Sir, tell me one thing,

301
00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:55.560 line:82%
you stand here all day,

302
00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:59.480 line:82%
don't you wish you were inside
on the President's chair?

303
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:01.190 line:82%
Why should I think that?

304
00:24:01.274 --> 00:24:03.734 line:82%
In the police, we get regular promotions.

305
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.363 line:82%
But once you become President,
there's no scope of promotion at all!

306
00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:10.616 line:82%
You're a very funny man!

307
00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:12.285 line:82%
All thanks goes to my grandfather.

308
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.996 line:82%
-Grandfather?
-My grandfather worked for the British.

309
00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:17.415 line:82%
All day long they used to say,
"Jolly good."

310
00:24:17.707 --> 00:24:20.543 line:82%
When I was born, he lost his memory.

311
00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.420 line:82%
All he remembered was, "Jolly good."

312
00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:24.088 line:82%
So that's what he named me, Jolly Good.

313
00:24:25.423 --> 00:24:26.757 line:82%
Yes, have a laugh at me.

314
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:28.593 line:82%
Even the officers that pass by here,

315
00:24:28.676 --> 00:24:31.679 line:82%
they also say, "Jolly Good... Singh"
and move on with laughing.

316
00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:33.389 line:82%
I think that's great.

317
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.558 line:82%
Because of you,
the country is running in good spirits!

318
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:37.602 line:82%
That "Jolly Good... Singh."

319
00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:40.146 line:82%
Rehan!

320
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.738 line:82%
"I felt God himself had blessed me.

321
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.701 line:82%
When all she did was
to address me with grace."

322
00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:58.289 line:82%
Very nice!

323
00:24:58.831 --> 00:24:59.874 line:82%
Rikshaw!

324
00:25:04.462 --> 00:25:05.630 line:82%
Hello!

325
00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:09.467 line:82%
Look, I sent Rana with Balwante.

326
00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:11.510 line:82%
No, I'm not coming today.

327
00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:14.555 line:82%
So what, I didn't tell you earlier,
I'm telling you now.

328
00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:16.849 line:82%
-Let's go.
-You left work without permission?

329
00:25:17.808 --> 00:25:18.809 line:82%
Yeah, so?

330
00:25:19.477 --> 00:25:21.938 line:82%
My father says that if a person
can't be loyal to his work

331
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:24.232 line:82%
they can't be trusted with anything.

332
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:26.442 line:82%
Very good!

333
00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:30.738 line:82%
I've left work for you,
and you're giving me a speech on loyalty?

334
00:25:30.905 --> 00:25:33.491 line:82%
My mother says there
is nothing bigger than loyalty.

335
00:25:34.492 --> 00:25:36.702 line:82%
If you're done with your mother
and father's sermons, can we go?

336
00:25:36.786 --> 00:25:38.371 line:82%
Why am I telling you all of this?

337
00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:39.622 line:82%
Why are you telling me this?

338
00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:44.502 line:82%
-So that I go back to work?
-Yes.

339
00:25:50.424 --> 00:25:51.550 line:82%
Think about it.

340
00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:55.596 line:82%
If I go today, I won't come back tomorrow.

341
00:25:56.973 --> 00:26:00.268 line:82%
I will go back to the guest house,
you will go back to work.

342
00:26:00.518 --> 00:26:03.145 line:82%
Tomorrow, you will take the day off,
and then we will go, okay?

343
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.985 line:82%
You've heard what your parents have said.

344
00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:12.196 line:82%
Now, listen to me carefully.

345
00:26:13.948 --> 00:26:16.617 line:82%
If I go today,
I will not come back tomorrow.

346
00:26:21.664 --> 00:26:22.748 line:82%
You will come.

347
00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:24.417 line:82%
Let's go.

348
00:26:25.543 --> 00:26:28.337 line:82%
"I don't live the life of the selfless,

349
00:26:28.838 --> 00:26:31.799 line:82%
nor do I grab another's wine.

350
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.553 line:82%
If she loves, let her come and declare it.

351
00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:39.932 line:82%
I do not follow anyone."

352
00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:42.601 line:82%
God be with you.

353
00:26:44.312 --> 00:26:48.232 line:82%
Heavenly

354
00:26:48.316 --> 00:26:52.570 line:82%
Heavenly

355
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:02.371 line:82%
Greetings, Ms. Zooni.

356
00:27:02.455 --> 00:27:04.415 line:82%
-Greetings, Mr. Jolly.
-Excellent!

357
00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:07.001 line:82%
I'm greeting you in your language
and you're greeting me in mine.

358
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:09.712 line:82%
You know what happened yesterday?

359
00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:11.797 line:82%
Yesterday, I said good morning
to 20 people

360
00:27:12.006 --> 00:27:14.008 line:82%
and they all said good evening
to me instead.

361
00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:17.553 line:82%
-How can so many people be wrong?
-No, it was my watch that was wrong.

362
00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:18.721 line:82%
It stopped in the morning,

363
00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:21.682 line:82%
so I said "good morning"
to everyone until night!

364
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:25.227 line:82%
I can't see Rehan today.

365
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.146 line:82%
I can't see him either.

366
00:27:29.357 --> 00:27:30.691 line:82%
I think he's like me,

367
00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:37.073 line:82%
completely clean from the heart
and completely muddled from the brain.

368
00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:41.327 line:82%
"I couldn't quench my thirst with water,
so, I set off for the bar.

369
00:27:43.245 --> 00:27:45.790 line:82%
I thought of complaining to God about you,

370
00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:48.918 line:82%
but he too turns out to be your admirer."

371
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:50.836 line:82%
Jolly good!

372
00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:56.425 line:82%
I'm with you now.

373
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:58.719 line:82%
So, how can you show Delhi
to a blind girl?

374
00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:06.811 line:82%
Can you see me, Zooni?

375
00:28:08.062 --> 00:28:09.063 line:82%
No way.

376
00:28:14.235 --> 00:28:15.528 line:82%
How's my voice?

377
00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:23.828 line:82%
Like the thunder before the storm.

378
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:28.666 line:82%
How do I smell?

379
00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:35.423 line:82%
Like the earth after the first rain.

380
00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:48.060 line:82%
How do I feel?

381
00:28:51.564 --> 00:28:53.816 line:82%
Like a prince in a beggar's clothing.

382
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.948 line:82%
And just like this, you will see Delhi.

383
00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:13.836 line:82%
Watch out!

384
00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:16.422 line:82%
This is called Khooni Darwaza.

385
00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:20.301 line:82%
The emperor Aurangzeb
had his brother, Dara Shikoh, beheaded,

386
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:21.927 line:82%
-and hung his head up here.
-Rehan!

387
00:29:22.303 --> 00:29:23.721 line:82%
Exactly where you are standing.

388
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.057 line:82%
And the British government,
shot two sons and the grandson...

389
00:29:27.141 --> 00:29:28.893 line:82%
-Rehan!
-...of Bahadur Shah Zafar,

390
00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:30.978 line:82%
right there, behind you.

391
00:29:31.604 --> 00:29:33.606 line:82%
Rehan, that's enough.

392
00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:35.316 line:82%
Let's leave from here.

393
00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:38.611 line:82%
This is the bloody history of Delhi.

394
00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:42.907 line:82%
From the Mughals to the British,
whoever came to India,

395
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.742 line:82%
caused a bloodshed in Delhi.

396
00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:49.747 line:82%
That's why, until today,
the tears of blood flow from these walls.

397
00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:56.712 line:82%
Scared? What did you think?
I won't take revenge for yesterday?

398
00:29:57.087 --> 00:29:59.840 line:82%
And what did you think,
I would get scared so easily?

399
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.345 line:82%
When I have never seen any colors,
how can the color of blood scare me?

400
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:29.620 line:82%
Now you're scared.

401
00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:48.597 line:82%
I'm going to Delhi to get her back.

402
00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:50.641 line:82%
Four days are enough to understand life.

403
00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:51.725 line:82%
Zulfi!

404
00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:54.895 line:82%
What's happening to her without us,
do you have any idea?

405
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:06.824 line:82%
She's brought up on home-cooked meals,
she must be starving in Delhi.

406
00:31:12.705 --> 00:31:16.667 line:82%
The Delhi crowd, who would care for her?

407
00:31:16.917 --> 00:31:18.460 line:82%
Who? I'm not there, am I?

408
00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:31.348 line:82%
I can't take her agony anymore, I'm going.

409
00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:33.601 line:82%
Are you going for her sake
or for your own?

410
00:31:55.998 --> 00:31:58.292 line:82%
IMMORTAL SOLDIER

411
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:10.012 line:82%
Let's go.

412
00:32:19.188 --> 00:32:20.564 line:82%
You were right, Rehan.

413
00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:24.068 line:82%
You did show me Delhi.

414
00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:33.327 line:82%
Hello, sir, here are the breads.

415
00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:35.412 line:82%
They say,

416
00:32:35.496 --> 00:32:38.499 line:82%
the feeling that one gets for the country
in front of the Immortal Soldier Flame,

417
00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:42.002 line:82%
he gets the same
in front of the Taj Mahal, for love.

418
00:32:45.756 --> 00:32:49.093 line:82%
Feelings, love,
those are meaningless talks.

419
00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:51.679 line:82%
When it comes down to the basics,

420
00:32:52.471 --> 00:32:54.515 line:82%
then, needs are everything.

421
00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:56.558 line:82%
Needs of the stomach,

422
00:32:57.851 --> 00:32:58.936 line:82%
needs of the body.

423
00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:02.606 line:82%
So you believe that needs are everything

424
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:03.941 line:82%
-and that feelings are nothing?
-Yes.

425
00:33:05.234 --> 00:33:09.988 line:82%
Okay, so you're spending time with me,
is this also to fulfill some need?

426
00:33:14.702 --> 00:33:16.203 line:82%
You shouldn't arouse a man like me.

427
00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:19.581 line:82%
My needs are great.

428
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.542 line:82%
Even one chicken is not enough.

429
00:33:22.209 --> 00:33:24.336 line:82%
-Hey!
-Even one girl is not enough.

430
00:33:36.682 --> 00:33:40.477 line:82%
So, Rehan darling,
how are things with you?

431
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.354 line:82%
And how are you, Zeenat?

432
00:33:46.066 --> 00:33:47.568 line:82%
Have you forgotten how I am?

433
00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:52.072 line:82%
Come once and meet me, I will remind you.

434
00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:55.659 line:82%
Apologies, it's my fault actually.

435
00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.370 line:82%
He's been busy with me
for the last couple of days.

436
00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:00.956 line:82%
That's what makes the guide, Rehan,
so special.

437
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.545 line:82%
So, when do you plan
on being busy with me again?

438
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.551 line:82%
"I can't explain the ways
of this market to you.

439
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:18.098 line:82%
He who is sold can't ever be
a buyer again."

440
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:23.187 line:82%
Rehan darling,
you will never improve, ever.

441
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:25.814 line:82%
Good evening.

442
00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:37.826 line:82%
You seem to know her very well.

443
00:34:41.622 --> 00:34:42.748 line:82%
That's me.

444
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:45.793 line:82%
I told you...

445
00:34:47.169 --> 00:34:49.213 line:82%
I only believe in needs,

446
00:34:49.838 --> 00:34:51.048 line:82%
not in feelings or love.

447
00:34:53.842 --> 00:34:55.219 line:82%
And I only believe in love.

448
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:10.025 line:82%
Meeting that guide in secret,
forget about Helen,

449
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:12.861 line:82%
but I can't believe you lied to me!

450
00:35:13.028 --> 00:35:14.446 line:82%
This is why I lied to you.

451
00:35:14.655 --> 00:35:16.657 line:82%
You're less of my friend
and more of a Hitler.

452
00:35:16.907 --> 00:35:19.618 line:82%
Hitler? I am just protecting you.

453
00:35:19.827 --> 00:35:22.246 line:82%
Not me, you are protecting my blindness.

454
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:27.918 line:82%
Look, how do I explain it to you?
He just isn't right for you, Zooni.

455
00:35:28.377 --> 00:35:32.506 line:82%
Perhaps, but when I'm with him,
I feel happy.

456
00:35:33.841 --> 00:35:35.509 line:82%
I feel alive.

457
00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:39.680 line:82%
And this feeling is special, very special.

458
00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:44.268 line:82%
But I don't like that guide, not one bit.

459
00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:48.605 line:82%
And come what may, Zooni.
I will never let you go with him, never.

460
00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:54.945 line:82%
Turn off your light.

461
00:36:04.872 --> 00:36:06.123 line:82%
Take it, my girl.

462
00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:08.375 line:82%
Thank you, Mr. Jolly.

463
00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:10.752 line:82%
Mr. Jolly, could you please
allow my good luck to come in?

464
00:36:11.628 --> 00:36:14.715 line:82%
Don't insist, my girl.
This tough Sikh has a soft heart.

465
00:36:14.798 --> 00:36:17.801 line:82%
I'm sorry, but rules are rules,
and rules are never jolly good.

466
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:21.597 line:82%
I know you're only doing your duty.

467
00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:23.891 line:82%
But still, I will be singing for him.

468
00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:48.415 line:82%
People say that after so many years
of independence,

469
00:36:48.624 --> 00:36:50.709 line:82%
our Republic Day has lost its meaning.

470
00:36:51.168 --> 00:36:54.046 line:82%
That it's just another holiday,
and nothing else.

471
00:36:54.588 --> 00:36:56.632 line:82%
But for me, it's not just a holiday.

472
00:36:57.507 --> 00:36:59.885 line:82%
This day marks the birth of my country.

473
00:37:01.303 --> 00:37:04.181 line:82%
Some people believe
that the condition of our country

474
00:37:04.431 --> 00:37:06.183 line:82%
is like our old monuments.

475
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.227 line:82%
The beauty of those remained in the past.

476

in my country.

00:37:14.274 --> 00:37:17.986 line:82%
But the people who can see,
why can't they see the beauty here?

478

What Emperor Shah Jahan said
about Kashmir,

479

we, the girls from Kashmir, believe that

480
00:37:22.908 --> 00:37:25.160 line:82%

for the whole of India.

He said that I'm the cutest
of all the girls.

530
00:43:01.329 --> 00:43:03.957 line:82%
After you, of course. Go, Zooni.

531
00:43:06.126 --> 00:43:08.211 line:82%
Stop, you can't go anywhere.

532
00:43:08.295 --> 00:43:09.296 line:82%
Fatty!

533
00:43:10.463 --> 00:43:11.923 line:82%
Certainly not like this.

534
00:43:12.424 --> 00:43:13.925 line:82%
Your hair is all over the place.

535
00:43:14.009 --> 00:43:15.719 line:82%
You haven't even worn your shawl properly.

536
00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:17.429 line:82%
How can I let you go like this?

537
00:43:18.054 --> 00:43:20.598 line:82%
-Fatty, you're really...
-Okay, that's enough.

538
00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:25.603 line:82%
Go, Zooni.

539
00:43:32.152 --> 00:43:34.070 line:82%
-Bobo!
-Let's go.

540
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:41.870 line:82%
"The fire is in the sun,

541
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:44.831 line:82%
but it's the earth that burns.

542
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.417 line:82%
The eyes fall in love,

543
00:43:48.001 --> 00:43:50.003 line:82%
but it's the heart that suffers."

544
00:43:54.299 --> 00:43:56.217 line:82%
You're looking exceptionally beautiful
this evening.

545
00:43:57.677 --> 00:43:58.678 line:82%
Really?

546
00:43:59.262 --> 00:44:01.056 line:82%
But you're looking exactly the same to me.

547
00:44:15.862 --> 00:44:16.863 line:82%
Rehan,

548
00:44:17.113 --> 00:44:20.533 line:82%
you have brought me here?
I thought you don't believe in God.

549
00:44:22.035 --> 00:44:23.620 line:82%
Will you just keep quiet for a bit?

550
00:44:31.753 --> 00:44:33.171 line:82%
Shut your eyes now.

551
00:44:33.963 --> 00:44:36.424 line:82%
Rehan, I hope you remember
that I'm visually impaired.

552
00:44:38.385 --> 00:44:40.512 line:82%
Rest your eyelids for a while.

553
00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:51.189 line:82%
It's a common belief
that this holy water does miracles.

554
00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:58.154 line:82%
I pray for it to be true.

555
00:45:03.743 --> 00:45:06.162 line:82%
No one has ever asked
for such a blessing for me.

556
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:13.336 line:82%
It's not for you,
I'm doing this for myself.

557
00:45:14.921 --> 00:45:18.299 line:82%
Perhaps when your eyes open,
you will keep your mouth shut.

558
00:45:25.098 --> 00:45:27.100 line:82%
Where are we? It's so noisy!

559
00:45:27.392 --> 00:45:28.643 line:82%
This is the real Delhi.

560
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:31.563 line:82%
The quiet museums, Red Fort,
that's not the real Delhi.

561
00:45:31.855 --> 00:45:34.482 line:82%
This is the sound of Delhi,
the essence of Delhi.

562
00:45:35.108 --> 00:45:36.734 line:82%
I wish I was deaf as well.

563
00:45:38.278 --> 00:45:39.696 line:82%
Just a minute. Wait here.

564
00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:41.281 line:82%
-Hello.
-Rehan.

565
00:45:41.364 --> 00:45:42.532 line:82%
Yes, it's me.

566
00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:43.825 line:82%
Rehan?

567
00:45:46.786 --> 00:45:48.413 line:82%
-Yes, I got it, all right.
-Rehan.

568
00:45:48.496 --> 00:45:49.956 line:82%
Rehan, you're watching me, aren't you?

569
00:45:50.415 --> 00:45:51.416 line:82%
Rehan!

570
00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:55.503 line:82%
Zooni!

571
00:45:57.338 --> 00:45:58.548 line:82%
What's this madness?

572
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:00.383 line:82%
I just wanted to show you.

573
00:46:00.467 --> 00:46:02.552 line:82%
Show what? That you're such a fool?

574
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:04.596 line:82%
-No.
-I will call you later.

575
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:07.223 line:82%
Boys and girls, you know,

576
00:46:07.307 --> 00:46:11.269 line:82%
they impress each other
on their first dates.

577
00:46:11.853 --> 00:46:13.271 line:82%
So I thought that...

578
00:46:17.609 --> 00:46:19.360 line:82%
Your life is very precious, Zooni.

579
00:46:20.028 --> 00:46:24.073 line:82%
Don't waste it on anyone,
certainly not on me.

580
00:46:25.158 --> 00:46:28.828 line:82%
My mother says, to gain something,
you have to lose something.

581
00:46:29.204 --> 00:46:30.788 line:82%
Oh, god!

582
00:46:31.748 --> 00:46:33.500 line:82%
"Mother says this, father says that."

583
00:46:33.583 --> 00:46:35.919 line:82%
Where is Zooni in all this?
What does Zooni say?

584
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.713 line:82%
Nobody has ever asked Zooni.

585
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:40.465 line:82%
I'm asking you. Tell me.

586
00:46:41.508 --> 00:46:42.717 line:82%
I like you.

587
00:46:52.185 --> 00:46:53.186 line:82%
Let's go.

588
00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:10.745 line:82%
Now you're scared.

589
00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:39.482 line:82%
You're still scared.

590
00:47:58.501 --> 00:47:59.919 line:82%
I can manage from here.

591
00:48:49.719 --> 00:48:51.262 line:82%
Where is the gorgeous Rehan?

592
00:48:51.638 --> 00:48:53.389 line:82%
What's the time on your watch, Bobo?

593
00:48:53.848 --> 00:48:54.891 line:82%
It's 10:30 a.m.

594
00:48:56.851 --> 00:48:59.896 line:82%
My watch is fine. Why is he late?

595
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.023 line:82%
It's our last day.

596
00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:05.652 line:82%
Maybe he's getting you a gift,
that's why he's late.

597
00:49:06.569 --> 00:49:07.945 line:82%
He himself is a gift.

598
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:11.574 line:82%
No news?

599
00:49:13.076 --> 00:49:14.077 line:82%
No.

600
00:49:23.044 --> 00:49:25.505 line:82%
No, Fatty, nothing yet.

601
00:49:28.424 --> 00:49:29.425 line:82%
Mom?

602
00:49:29.509 --> 00:49:30.635 line:82%
Zooni!

603
00:49:31.344 --> 00:49:33.221 line:82%
How are you, my child?

604
00:49:34.055 --> 00:49:36.599 line:82%
We saw your performance on TV.

605
00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:38.226 line:82%
It was fantastic.

606
00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:42.522 line:82%
When everyone stood up to clap,
your father and me--

607
00:49:42.605 --> 00:49:43.606 line:82%
Mom.

608
00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:46.317 line:82%
I want to talk to you about something.

609
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:47.860 line:82%
What is it? Tell me.

610
00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:51.280 line:82%
When you and Dad first met,

611
00:49:53.241 --> 00:49:55.535 line:82%
after he tended to you in the hospital,

612
00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:58.538 line:82%
if he had suddenly disappeared,

613
00:49:59.205 --> 00:50:00.581 line:82%
what would you have done?

614
00:50:00.665 --> 00:50:03.835 line:82%
I would have asked him
why he was misbehaving so much.

615
00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:06.963 line:82%
And tell him to stop this nonsense
immediately.

616
00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:10.133 line:82%
"Misbehaving"? Who is misbehaving?

617
00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:12.260 line:82%
So, is that what I should do?

618
00:50:12.468 --> 00:50:13.511 line:82%
Who is he?

619
00:50:13.594 --> 00:50:14.721 line:82%
Who is who?

620
00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:16.973 line:82%
Rehan.

621
00:50:17.223 --> 00:50:19.183 line:82%
-Rehan.
-Rehan?

622
00:50:19.976 --> 00:50:21.519 line:82%
So do you love him?

623
00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:23.396 line:82%
"Do you love him?" What are you saying?

624
00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:26.441 line:82%
-Give me the phone, I will deal with this.
-Just a minute, Zulfi, please.

625
00:50:27.817 --> 00:50:30.278 line:82%
-Yes.
-So, what have you decided?

626
00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:35.408 line:82%
Nothing, maybe he doesn't love me.

627
00:50:35.491 --> 00:50:36.492 line:82%
Zooni,

628
00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:38.244 line:82%
just remember one thing, dear.

629
00:50:38.828 --> 00:50:41.831 line:82%
Give your life for the one
who gives you his love.

630
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:45.376 line:82%
But give your self-respect

631
00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.879 line:82%
only to the one who is willing
to be destroyed for your love.

632
00:50:55.595 --> 00:50:56.929 line:82%
This is Humayun's Tomb.

633
00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:59.348 line:82%
It was constructed for him
by his wife, Hamida.

634
00:50:59.432 --> 00:51:02.268 line:82%
Take a look at what a wife
made for her husband.

635
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:04.437 line:82%
And you can't even make me breakfast.

636
00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:08.816 line:82%
Don't worry, I will start building
your grave right away.

637
00:51:10.193 --> 00:51:11.194 line:82%
Come.

638
00:51:11.277 --> 00:51:13.738 line:82%
I am blind and you are the one
who can't see me?

639
00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:17.950 line:82%
"If by chance, I have made a mistake,

640
00:51:18.785 --> 00:51:20.995 line:82%
then please consider it
as a mistake and forget it.

641
00:51:21.704 --> 00:51:23.706 line:82%
But forget just the mistake

642
00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:26.834 line:82%
even by mistake, don't ever forget me."

643
00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:29.921 line:82%
That's amazing. Great. You heard that?

644
00:51:32.799 --> 00:51:34.217 line:82%
Balwante, take them ahead.

645
00:51:38.387 --> 00:51:40.056 line:82%
-Let's go.
-But our guide--

646
00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:41.224 line:82%
Stop it!

647
00:51:41.557 --> 00:51:44.727 line:82%
There is no but, only the Sikh!

648
00:51:45.311 --> 00:51:46.521 line:82%
Move it!

649
00:51:47.146 --> 00:51:48.815 line:82%
Look here, it's the Qutub Minar.

650
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:54.403 line:82%
No, Zooni.

651
00:51:55.446 --> 00:51:56.739 line:82%
Fatty was right.

652
00:51:58.574 --> 00:52:00.368 line:82%
You should love a prince,

653
00:52:02.036 --> 00:52:03.538 line:82%
not a devil like me.

654
00:52:06.624 --> 00:52:08.042 line:82%
It's too late now.

655
00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:11.045 line:82%
Now this devil is my prince.

656
00:52:15.758 --> 00:52:17.677 line:82%
I can't give you anything, Zooni.

657
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:20.596 line:82%
Remember what I told you?

658
00:52:21.097 --> 00:52:24.725 line:82%
I believe in needs,
not in feelings or love.

659
00:52:27.061 --> 00:52:30.356 line:82%
Women are like cities for me.

660
00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:34.777 line:82%
I spend some time in one,

661
00:52:35.236 --> 00:52:36.654 line:82%
get immersed in it,

662
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:39.490 line:82%
and then, move to another city.

663
00:52:41.534 --> 00:52:45.288 line:82%
This is what I am, and I cannot change.

664
00:52:48.958 --> 00:52:50.001 line:82%
Look, Rehan,

665
00:52:50.877 --> 00:52:53.629 line:82%
all this princely world sounds good
in dreams,

666
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:55.089 line:82%
not in reality.

667
00:52:56.007 --> 00:52:58.301 line:82%
I have found you, this is destiny.

668
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:02.305 line:82%
We haven't met by chance,
we've met by destiny.

669
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:05.308 line:82%
If not the rest of our lives,

670
00:53:05.391 --> 00:53:08.227 line:82%
at least we can spend
the next 12 hours together, can't we?

671
00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:12.231 line:82%
Perhaps all we have is today.

672
00:53:13.524 --> 00:53:15.359 line:82%
Just today, just now.

673
00:53:21.157 --> 00:53:22.783 line:82%
Don't come closer to me, Zooni.

674
00:53:25.161 --> 00:53:27.079 line:82%
This storm will destroy you.

675
00:53:31.834 --> 00:53:34.503 line:82%
"May my life's breath find refuge
in your heart.

676
00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:41.260 line:82%
May my life's breath find refuge
in your heart.

677
00:53:42.345 --> 00:53:45.431 line:82%
Destroyed in your love,
may my life depart."

678
00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:53.272 line:82%
How can you love me so much?

679
00:53:55.775 --> 00:53:58.319 line:82%
How can one love someone so much?

680
00:54:09.205 --> 00:54:11.082 line:82%
It's a promise, Zooni Ali Beg.

681
00:54:11.832 --> 00:54:16.420 line:82%
The next 12 hours will be
the most beautiful time of your life.

682
00:55:18.899 --> 00:55:21.652 line:82%
The raindrops have a conspiracy

683
00:55:21.861 --> 00:55:24.447 line:82%
They have a silent wish or a plea

684
00:55:24.697 --> 00:55:27.450 line:82%
The raindrops have a conspiracy

685
00:55:27.783 --> 00:55:30.286 line:82%
They have a silent wish or a plea

686
00:55:30.578 --> 00:55:34.832 line:82%
Look at this, just see

687
00:55:36.417 --> 00:55:41.172 line:82%
Look at this, just see

688
00:55:41.756 --> 00:55:44.425 line:82%
Softly and slowly this gentle breeze

689
00:55:44.508 --> 00:55:47.053 line:82%
Says so many things, listen, please

690
00:55:48.095 --> 00:55:53.684 line:82%
Why there is a distanceBetween you and me

691
00:55:54.101 --> 00:55:58.522 line:82%
Look at this, just see

692
00:55:59.982 --> 00:56:05.237 line:82%
Look at this, just see

693
00:56:38.062 --> 00:56:42.191 line:82%
The winds will never beSuch shameless again

694
00:56:43.818 --> 00:56:48.322 line:82%
Our steps will never falterSo blameless again

695
00:56:49.657 --> 00:56:54.411 line:82%
The winds will never beSuch shameless again

696
00:56:55.204 --> 00:57:00.126 line:82%
Our steps will never falterSo blameless again

697
00:57:01.669 --> 00:57:06.882 line:82%
This rain is not so straightIt has a twist

698
00:57:07.508 --> 00:57:11.887 line:82%
Certainly, it's telling us somethingAs it pours and mists

699
00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:17.101 line:82%
Just understand it

700
00:57:17.643 --> 00:57:23.274 line:82%
Just understand it

701
00:57:23.482 --> 00:57:25.943 line:82%
Softly and slowly this gentle breeze

702
00:57:26.193 --> 00:57:29.113 line:82%
Says so many things, listen, please

703
00:57:29.655 --> 00:57:35.119 line:82%
Why there is a distanceBetween you and me

704
00:57:35.494 --> 00:57:39.623 line:82%
Look at this, just see

705
00:57:41.208 --> 00:57:47.006 line:82%
Look at this, just see

706
00:58:27.922 --> 00:58:32.009 line:82%
The desire like a fireflyThat glows bright and dims

707
00:58:33.761 --> 00:58:38.182 line:82%
We're in such a sweet predicamentWhat can be done?

708
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:43.854 line:82%
The desire like a fireflyThat glows bright and dims

709
00:58:45.105 --> 00:58:49.860 line:82%
We're in such a sweet predicamentWhat can be done?

710
00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:57.076 line:82%
Don't discard the requestOf the lips like this

711
00:58:57.284 --> 00:59:01.747 line:82%
Don't call this wishOf the breath a remiss

712
00:59:02.289 --> 00:59:06.669 line:82%
Just touch it and feel this

713
00:59:08.087 --> 00:59:13.175 line:82%
Just touch it and feel this

714
00:59:13.425 --> 00:59:16.011 line:82%
Softly and slowly this gentle breeze

715
00:59:16.428 --> 00:59:19.181 line:82%
Says so many things, listen, please

716
00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:24.728 line:82%
Why there is a distanceBetween you and me

00:59:30.693 --> 00:59:33.654 line:82%

722
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.193 line:82%
Rehan?

723
01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:14.945 line:82%
Rehan.

724
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.156 line:82%
Wake up, please.

725
01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.199 line:82%
Wake up, please.

726
01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:23.287 line:82%
My train leaves at ten.
If you don't wake up, I will miss it.

727
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.039 line:82%
I spoke to Fatty,

728
01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.166 line:82%
and she's bringing my stuff
to the station.

729
01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:31.462 line:82%
We don't have to go to the guest house.
How much longer will you sleep?

730
01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:32.963 line:82%
Don't you have to go to work?

731
01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:35.174 line:82%
And don't you dare to miss work today.

732
01:00:35.591 --> 01:00:39.053 line:82%
See, I forgot, Mom had told me
to get the eye checkup done.

733
01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.971 line:82%
And Dad has asked for a chess set.

734
01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:44.767 line:82%
Can't we stop and get it on the way?
We do have time, don't we?

735
01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:49.813 line:82%
Rehan, are you listening?

736
01:00:54.026 --> 01:00:56.987 line:82%
Oh, I didn't even say goodbyeto Mr. Jolly Good Singh.

737
01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:59.073 line:82%
Please tell him on my behalf.

738
01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:01.408 line:82%
And...

739
01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.120 line:82%
here's my address.

740
01:01:06.622 --> 01:01:08.040 line:82%
You will write to me, won't you?

741
01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:11.043 line:82%
Is your wife visiting home
for the first time after marriage?

742
01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:31.814 line:82%
Zooni, I want to say that--

743
01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:33.273 line:82%
No, Rehan!

744
01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:38.153 line:82%
You made no promises,
and I will not ask you for anything.

745
01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:44.535 line:82%
I always wanted love
to be the most important thing in my life,

746
01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:48.288 line:82%
and now, it became true because of you.

747
01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:54.128 line:82%
You were wrong, Rehan.

748
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.880 line:82%
I was not destroyed in your storm,

749
01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.299 line:82%
I was rejuvenated.

750
01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:11.103 line:82%
Now, your picture
will always remain with me.

751
01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:20.571 line:82%
And now, I can't leave.

752
01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:26.577 line:82%
Not until you step off my shawl.

753
01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:42.176 line:82%
God be with you, Rehan.

754
01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:44.845 line:82%
Be happy.

755
01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:04.448 line:82%
Zooni.

756
01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.436 line:82%
Now, can I say that I was right?

757
01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:36.271 line:82%
No.

758
01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:38.607 line:82%
No!

759
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.776 line:82%
I won't say, I will never say it.

760
01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:47.032 line:82%
"May my life's breath find refuge
in your heart."

761
01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:49.117 line:82%
Rehan?

762
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.457 line:82%
"May my life's breath find refuge
in your heart.

763
01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.878 line:82%
Destroyed in your love,
may my life depart."

764
01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:02.297 line:82%
-Zooni.
-Rehan!

765
01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:12.099 line:82%
Hey, Fatty.

766
01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:14.268 line:82%
If not for me,

767
01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.812 line:82%
at least pull the chain for Zooni.

768
01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:20.107 line:82%
With pleasure.

769
01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:27.114 line:82%
What's going on?
What is the guide doing here?

770
01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.491 line:82%
The brave heart is taking his bride away.

771
01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:46.425 line:82%
He wants to marry you?

772
01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:48.969 line:82%
What? Who is he? What does he do?

773
01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.846 line:82%
What does he look like?
He wants to marry her!

774
01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:52.723 line:82%
They love each other.

775
01:04:53.265 --> 01:04:54.766 line:82%
So, what did you say to him?

776
01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:58.312 line:82%
What could I say?
I said he must ask my parents.

777
01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.646 line:82%
What did she tell him?

778
01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:00.939 line:82%
She's our daughter!

779
01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:03.400 line:82%
She wouldn't give any answer
without our consent.

780
01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:08.572 line:82%
Zooni, I have complete faith
in you and your choice.

781
01:05:08.864 --> 01:05:11.867 line:82%
Yes, my darling, tell him yes.

782
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:15.162 line:82%
And we're coming to Delhi right away
to get you married.

783
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:16.580 line:82%
Come quickly, Mom.

784
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.415 line:82%
I miss you so much.

785
01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.167 line:82%
Now, where are you going?

786
01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:23.378 line:82%
We're going to Delhi, aren't we?
We need to book tickets.

787
01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:25.797 line:82%
As usual, he runs away

788
01:05:25.881 --> 01:05:27.591 line:82%
the moment when there are tears
in his eyes.

789
01:05:30.218 --> 01:05:33.263 line:82%
God keep you safe, Mom, God keep you safe.

790
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.974 line:82%
God keep you safe, my child,
God keep you safe.

791
01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.984 line:82%
Our daughter has found her prince.

792
01:05:46.652 --> 01:05:48.904 line:82%
She has found her prince.

793
01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.457 line:82%
When did you last get your eyes checked?

794
01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:02.459 line:82%
I don't remember.

795
01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.920 line:82%
-Many years ago in Srinagar.
-That is the problem.

796
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:08.131 line:82%
We doctors go on about regular checkups,

797
01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:10.509 line:82%
but you people don't listen.

798
01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:13.428 line:82%
These days,
science has progressed so much,

799
01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:15.472 line:82%
that something which
was impossible five years ago

800
01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:16.682 line:82%
is possible now.

801
01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:18.225 line:82%
What do you mean?

802
01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:22.270 line:82%
Retinal replacement can help you
in the cases like yours.

803
01:06:22.688 --> 01:06:25.899 line:82%
The chances are very less,
but there is still a chance.

804
01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:29.111 line:82%
So you're saying that
Zooni will be able to see?

805
01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:31.947 line:82%
Yes, there is a chance.

806
01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:35.575 line:82%
We're ready to take that chance, doctor.

807
01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:38.286 line:82%
I will check the first available date.

808
01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:48.505 line:82%
There won't be any problem, doctor?

809
01:06:51.967 --> 01:06:55.429 line:82%
Don't worry, our best team is on it.

810
01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:57.639 line:82%
I will meet you after the operation.

811
01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:10.819 line:82%
Rehan, you're hugging me
for the tenth time.

812
01:07:12.154 --> 01:07:13.572 line:82%
I'm not complaining,

813
01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:17.826 line:82%
but please don't worry, I will be fine.

814
01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:23.165 line:82%
If you're so worried,
then why didn't you wait for Mom and Dad?

815
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.752 line:82%
We could have done this after the wedding?

816
01:07:27.753 --> 01:07:29.880 line:82%
Let's go, it's time for the operation.

817
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.138 line:82%
Don't forget to pick up Mom and Dad
from the station.

818
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:41.016 line:82%
And Jolly Good Singh,
wants to come here later as well.

819
01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.685 line:82%
You're going
to the President's Palace, right?

820
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:44.853 line:82%
Yes.

821
01:07:51.902 --> 01:07:52.944 line:82%
Zooni.

822
01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:09.127 line:82%
I love you very much.

823
01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:15.759 line:82%
I know.

824
01:08:19.721 --> 01:08:21.640 line:82%
After the bomb blast in Peshawar,

825
01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.850 line:82%
the Independent Kashmir Front has demanded

826
01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:27.145 line:82%
that both India and Pakistan leave Kashmir

827
01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.481 line:82%
and comply with their demandof an independent Kashmir.

828
01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:32.400 line:82%
Or else, both nationswould face similar attacks.

829
01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:51.586 line:82%
The Chief Minister has survived,

830
01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:55.465 line:82%
but as per the earlier reports,
eight security officers have been killed.

831
01:08:55.549 --> 01:08:58.802 line:82%
And at least 15 others are badly wounded.

832
01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.555 line:82%
The main building
has not been harmed very much,

833
01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.932 line:82%
but the left side of it
has faced severe damage

834
01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:05.976 line:82%
and is destroyed completely.

835
01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.811 line:82%
Two terrorists have been captured

836
01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:10.355 line:82%
and the IKF have claimed responsibility
for this bombing.

837
01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:13.859 line:82%
Their demand is that India and Pakistan
would leave Kashmir,

838
01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:15.986 line:82%
and let it be an independent country.

839
01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.841 line:82%
Zooni.

840
01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:41.428 line:82%
Mom.

841
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:44.389 line:82%
Mom.

842
01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.605 line:82%
-Mom.
-My child.

843
01:09:54.065 --> 01:09:55.650 line:82%
Mom, I can see.

844
01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:57.152 line:82%
Yes, my darling.

845
01:09:57.277 --> 01:10:00.155 line:82%
I can see, Dad

846
01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.618 line:82%
You can cry in front of me now, Dad.

847
01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:08.747 line:82%
I can see you cry.

848
01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:13.001 line:82%
But where is Rehan? He's not with you?

849
01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:17.172 line:82%
Didn't he pick you up from the station?

850
01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:25.013 line:82%
Dad, where are they taking us?

851
01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:30.769 line:82%
Why has your breathing changed Dad?
I'm not getting anything, Mom.

852
01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:34.648 line:82%
Mom, where is Rehan?
Why aren't we waiting for him?

853
01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.735 line:82%
Mom, why are you crying?

854
01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.028 line:82%
Mom?

855
01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:41.738 line:82%
Dad?

856
01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.121 line:82%
Where are we?

857
01:10:50.205 --> 01:10:52.123 line:82%
Dad, please let me go from here.

858
01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:54.334 line:82%
-Is it necessary to do this now?
-Yes, ma'am.

859
01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.585 line:82%
What do we have to do?

860
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:59.714 line:82%
Why can't we wait for Rehan?
Dad, where are we? Dad?

861
01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:01.466 line:82%
I'm getting suffocated here, Dad.
Please let's go.

862
01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:02.842 line:82%
Mom, let's go. Please.

863
01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.469 line:82%
The bomb blast at the President's Palace--

864
01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:07.347 line:82%
What do we have to do with that?
We don't know anything.

865
01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:10.934 line:82%
You're still crying, Mom, please don't.

866
01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:15.271 line:82%
-Please, Dad, get me out.
-Doctor?

867
01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:18.775 line:82%
Zooni, I was going to identify him,

868
01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:22.487 line:82%
but his state was such that I could not.

869
01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:25.573 line:82%
So you have to identify him, Zooni.
Is this Rehan or not?

870
01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:30.954 line:82%
No! It can't be Rehan.

871
01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:33.873 line:82%
It can't!

872
01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:35.166 line:82%
Please...

873
01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:39.421 line:82%
Don't make my daughter
go through this, please.

874
01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:44.259 line:82%
Identification is compulsory.

875
01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:54.352 line:82%
Zooni...

876
01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:59.482 line:82%
Zooni, my darling, even this is life.

877
01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:11.578 line:82%
If I wish, I was a roll of wool,wrapped around her fingers.

878
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:25.300 line:82%
I'm the fragrance of your breath.

879
01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:29.471 line:82%
How will you stop your breath?

880
01:12:33.058 --> 01:12:35.477 line:82%
How can you love me so much?

881
01:12:35.894 --> 01:12:38.313 line:82%
How can one love someone so much?

882
01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.321 line:82%
Don't come closer to me, Zooni.

883
01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:48.073 line:82%
This storm will destroy you.

884
01:12:57.457 --> 01:12:58.708 line:82%
Think about it.

885
01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:01.544 line:82%
If I go today, I won't come back tomorrow.

886
01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:13.264 line:82%
At this moment, we areat the Bureau of Military Intelligence.

887
01:13:13.348 --> 01:13:16.184 line:82%
There is not much information
about the blast,

888
01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:19.229 line:82%
but here is the head
of the Anti-Terrorist Unit,

889
01:13:19.354 --> 01:13:20.939 line:82%
Mr. Susheel Rawat.

890
01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.982 line:82%
Mr. Rawat, what can you tell us
about the blast?

891
01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:27.028 line:82%
When we know more, we will let you know.

892
01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:29.239 line:82%
But tell us something,
who is responsible for the blast?

893
01:13:30.824 --> 01:13:31.825 line:82%
These media people.

894
01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.702 line:82%
They start 24-hour channels,
and then, go after us to fill the time.

895
01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.163 line:82%
I will have them under control.

896
01:13:37.247 --> 01:13:39.999 line:82%
Sir, Tyagi has been called
from Intelligence Agency, RAW.

897
01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:42.127 line:82%
Tyagi?

898
01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.505 line:82%
Now things will be out of control.

899
01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.761 line:82%
So, Tyagi, is the case solved yet?

900
01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:00.937 line:82%
So, what does your psychology
mumbo jumbo say?

901
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.316 line:82%
-This is his work.
-Who?

902
01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.193 line:82%
Who are you talking about?

903
01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:09.571 line:82%
These two are telling the truth.

904
01:14:09.988 --> 01:14:11.406 line:82%
They haven't seen him.

905
01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:14.367 line:82%
They were simply given instructions.

906
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:17.829 line:82%
The master planner is someone else.

907
01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:20.456 line:82%
Do you need an invitation
to tell me his name?

908
01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.666 line:82%
Who is it?

909
01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:26.838 line:82%
This man has changed the face of the IKF.

910
01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:33.636 line:82%
He has taken a ragtag group
and made it a professional organization.

911
01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:36.598 line:82%
A group on par with the most deadly
in the world.

912
01:14:37.015 --> 01:14:41.853 line:82%
Rather than the best intelligence agencies
like CIA, KGB, MUSHAR,

913
01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.938 line:82%
even not smaller than RAW.

914
01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.566 line:82%
It's because of this man
that our eight ships

915
01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:49.736 line:82%
and a large part of the Bombay port
are under the water of the Arabian Sea.

916
01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:53.072 line:82%
It's because of this man
that Islamabad airport's new wing

917
01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.741 line:82%
was destroyed even before
it could be completed.

918
01:14:56.868 --> 01:15:00.622 line:82%
He, alone, has changed the face
of terrorism in India and Pakistan.

919
01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:07.337 line:82%
Those blood-shot eyes

920
01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:10.173 line:82%
and fanatical terroristsare a thing of the past.

921
01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:14.969 line:82%
This man is a thinker, a planner.No one knows his name.

922
01:15:15.053 --> 01:15:19.849 line:82%
No one knows his pastor where he comes from.

923
01:15:19.933 --> 01:15:22.894 line:82%
He can be anyone or no one.

924
01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:26.314 line:82%
He can be the man sitting next to youin a theater or the train,

925
01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:30.151 line:82%
or a bank teller,or even the cigarette seller outside.

926
01:15:30.235 --> 01:15:33.655 line:82%
He is very intelligent and dangerous.

927
01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.115 line:82%
We have to find him.

928
01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:38.451 line:82%
Because if we don't, he can take terrorism

929
01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:42.497 line:82%
to a level beyond our imagination,

930
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:45.458 line:82%
because our imaginationis nothing like him.

931
01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.595 line:82%
I'm sorry, Grandfather.
The mission was not entirely successful.

932
01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.140 line:82%
I had set everything,

933
01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:44.017 line:82%
but those fools
just didn't follow the instructions.

934
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.895 line:82%
Everyone can't be like my grandson,
a perfect soldier.

935
01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:51.524 line:82%
But, he made a mistake, too.

936
01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:55.445 line:82%
And unfortunately, because of a woman.

937
01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:59.407 line:82%
It's very unusualthat you were carried away like this.

938
01:16:59.866 --> 01:17:01.492 line:82%
And that too because of a woman?

939
01:17:01.576 --> 01:17:02.910 line:82%
She is dead now.

940
01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.539 line:82%
Now, listen to me carefully.

941
01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:08.916 line:82%
You don't need to worryabout this soldier.

942
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.960 line:82%
My concentration was

943
01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:12.879 line:82%
and will always remain
on our independence.

944
01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:15.506 line:82%
I am a soldier and nothing else.

945
01:17:16.174 --> 01:17:18.509 line:82%
That's all I wanted to hear, my grandson.

946
01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:20.928 line:82%
Now, I will meet you
after the Bangkok operation.

947
01:17:21.596 --> 01:17:22.930 line:82%
May God keep you safe.

948
01:17:33.775 --> 01:17:36.027 line:82%
You had taken me to my goal, Zooni.

949
01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:39.447 line:82%
I shouldn't have taken you off that train.

950
01:17:41.366 --> 01:17:44.952 line:82%
But I became weak,
and I fell in love with you.

951
01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:49.332 line:82%
If it's possible, forgive me, Zooni.

952
01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:53.044 line:82%
I shouldn't have brought you into my life.

953
01:18:07.809 --> 01:18:09.310 line:82%
God be with you.

954
01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:26.035 line:82%
You are the Defense Secretary,
you should have some power.

955
01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:28.496 line:82%
Do something, get that Tyagi off my back!

956
01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:30.706 line:82%
Last year, the AI-Qaeda's attempt
to attack on Delhi airport

957
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:32.333 line:82%
was foiled by Tyagi.

958
01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:34.001 line:82%
She got lucky once.

959
01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:35.962 line:82%
And now, she thinks
she's a big shot Intelligence officer.

960
01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:37.672 line:82%
I can't do anything now.

961
01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:40.675 line:82%
The Defense Minister himself
has asked her to be on this case.

962
01:18:41.509 --> 01:18:43.636 line:82%
Sir, it's nothing less
than the
Armageddon
.

963
01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:46.764 line:82%
The press shouldn't even get
a whiff of this.

964
01:18:47.265 --> 01:18:49.725 line:82%
This IKF has made our life hell.

965
01:18:50.685 --> 01:18:52.186 line:82%
First, the President's Palace bombing.

966
01:18:52.687 --> 01:18:56.107 line:82%
Back then, Karachi Oil refinery,
and last year, it was the plane hijacking.

967
01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:58.317 line:82%
And now, we heard

968
01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:02.113 line:82%
that they've stolen parts
of the nuclear missile from us,

969
01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:04.699 line:82%
Pakistan, and Russia,

970
01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:08.161 line:82%
and are ready with a nuclear missile.

971
01:19:09.287 --> 01:19:12.290 line:82%
Sir, this is their only way
of forcing India out of Kashmir.

972
01:19:12.707 --> 01:19:15.543 line:82%
When Kashmir's ruler, Hari Singh,
decided to join India in 1947,

973
01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:18.087 line:82%
then why all this now?

974
01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:21.632 line:82%
But the Kashmiris
had also been promised a vote,

975
01:19:21.716 --> 01:19:25.428 line:82%
a referendum to decide
whether they wanted to stay

976
01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.515 line:82%
a part of India or Pakistan
or whether to be independent.

977
01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:32.393 line:82%
All these years later,
they are still to get that referendum.

978
01:19:32.477 --> 01:19:34.061 line:82%
What referendum are you talking about?

979
01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:36.397 line:82%
When half of Kashmir
is occupied by Pakistan,

980
01:19:36.481 --> 01:19:39.025 line:82%
how is that possible?

981
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.360 line:82%
A referendum needs
to include all of Kashmir.

982
01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:43.029 line:82%
Why should it include only half?

983
01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:46.199 line:82%
Mr. Rawat, this is not
an India-Pakistan issue anymore.

984
01:19:47.074 --> 01:19:50.286 line:82%
IKF wants both India and Pakistan
to leave Kashmir.

985
01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:53.873 line:82%
They want a separate country,
an independent Kashmir.

986
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:58.544 line:82%
I know the history of India,
Pakistan, and Kashmir.

987
01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:00.505 line:82%
Tell me about this bomb, Mrs. Tyagi.

988
01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:04.342 line:82%
How powerful is this bomb,
and how dangerous is it to us?

989
01:20:04.884 --> 01:20:06.761 line:82%
In the last few years,

990
01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:11.682 line:82%
in Mumbai, Oklahoma City, New York,
Bali, Madrid, and London,

991
01:20:11.766 --> 01:20:14.685 line:82%
over 15,000 people
have been killed in a blast.

992
01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:17.104 line:82%
And losses have run into billions.

993
01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:21.192 line:82%
But if they use this bomb,

994
01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.529 line:82%
five million people can die.

995
01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.114 line:82%
An entire city can be destroyed.

996
01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:30.117 line:82%
That city can also be our capital,
New Delhi.

997
01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:34.330 line:82%
We must stop this bomb, whatever it takes.

998
01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:38.042 line:82%
But, sir, this bomb is useless to them.

999
01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:39.627 line:82%
What do you mean?

1000
01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:42.129 line:82%
Every nuclear missile needs
a special trigger.

1001
01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:46.300 line:82%
If they don't have that,
they can't use the bomb.

1002
01:20:47.969 --> 01:20:51.389 line:82%
Only until they get the trigger,
only until then.

1003
01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:54.141 line:82%
Sir, there's nothing to worry about.

1004
01:20:54.225 --> 01:20:56.936 line:82%
Outside Delhi, we have six triggers

1005
01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:58.604 line:82%
at various military bases
around the country.

1006
01:20:58.896 --> 01:21:01.983 line:82%
In Rajasthan, Kutch, Darjeeling,
Amritsar, Leh, and Kashmir.

1007
01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:03.526 line:82%
They are safe there.

1008
01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:05.528 line:82%
I want all the triggers brought to Delhi.

1009
01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:09.031 line:82%
In the next 12 hours,
they will all be here, sir.

1010
01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.410 line:82%
Get me speaking
to the Defense Minister of Pakistan,

1011
01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:14.829 line:82%
I want to share the information with him.

1012
01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:17.790 line:82%
Just as we are taking steps
to secure the triggers,

1013
01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:21.210 line:82%
IKF's mastermind would be taking steps
to steal them.

1014
01:21:33.014 --> 01:21:34.181 line:82%
Captain Ranjith!

1015
01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:39.854 line:82%
Captain Ranjith, run!

1016
01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.733 line:82%
Captain Ranjith, run!

1017
01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:59.206 line:82%
Major Suraj,
there's a radio message for you, sir!

1018
01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:05.921 line:82%
My unit has succeeded
in all of its missions, sir.

1019
01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.549 line:82%
And I will bring this trigger
to you myself.

1020
01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:11.552 line:82%
Be alert.
IKF will be keeping an eye on you.

1021
01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:13.638 line:82%
If the weather favors us,
the trigger will be with you

1022
01:22:13.721 --> 01:22:15.431 line:82%
-in three hours, sir.
-Goodbye.

1023
01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:17.099 line:82%
Over and out, goodbye.

1024
01:22:17.725 --> 01:22:18.809 line:82%
Captain Ranjeev,

1025
01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.355 line:82%
this is the day every soldier lives for.

1026
01:22:23.356 --> 01:22:25.483 line:82%
The last time you saved me from the IKF.

1027
01:22:25.983 --> 01:22:28.944 line:82%
Today, we both must save
the country together.

1028
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.952 line:82%
I am always ready to kill or get killed
for the country, sir.

1029
01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:45.961 line:82%
Good news!

1030
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:50.591 line:82%
The trigger will be with us soon.

1031
01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:53.219 line:82%
May God bless Rehan!

1032
01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:54.804 line:82%
Say everyone.

1033
01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.847 line:82%
-God is great!
-God is great!

1034
01:22:57.932 --> 01:22:59.266 line:82%
Captain Ranjeev.

1035
01:23:08.359 --> 01:23:09.777 line:82%
I am fine. How are you?

1036
01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:11.529 line:82%
She is going to save the country.

1037
01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:15.032 line:82%
I know you wanted custard,
not rice pudding.

1038
01:23:15.116 --> 01:23:17.702 line:82%
But Grandma has made rice pudding
with so much love, so, please have it.

1039
01:23:17.785 --> 01:23:19.662 line:82%
What have you brought?
Rice pudding or custard?

1040
01:23:19.954 --> 01:23:22.331 line:82%
We've checked the list of officers
coming from Kashmir.

1041
01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:26.627 line:82%
How can it be not?
I have handpicked these officers.

1042
01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:30.715 line:82%
The best of Indian Army's elite officers
were chosen to form this unit.

1043
01:23:31.132 --> 01:23:32.508 line:82%
Okay, so that's where he is.

1044
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:33.634 line:82%
Who?

1045
01:23:33.718 --> 01:23:36.971 line:82%
The wife of Captain Ranjeev,
an ace officer of Jaat Regiment,

1046
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:40.474 line:82%
had reported that she hasn't been in touch
with her husband for last two months.

1047
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:44.019 line:82%
She wanted to know
if he was on a secret mission or not.

1048
01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:46.063 line:82%
After all, she's a wife.

1049
01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:49.567 line:82%
She must be nagging him
with pudding or custard.

1050
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.695 line:82%
He got annoyed and stopped calling her.

1051
01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:55.322 line:82%
He hasn't called his wife for two months?

1052
01:23:55.406 --> 01:23:58.409 line:82%
Just find out if his last mission
had something to do with the IKF.

1053
01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.583 line:82%
Major Suraj's regiment
was attacked by the IKF.

1054
01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:09.128 line:82%
At the last moment, Captain Ranjeev's
regiment got there and saved them.

1055
01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:12.631 line:82%
All the soldiers of Jaat Regiment
were killed in this encounter,

1056
01:24:12.715 --> 01:24:14.133 line:82%
but he survived.

1057
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:18.512 line:82%
That's him.

1058
01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.681 line:82%
We have to stop him.

1059
01:24:21.015 --> 01:24:23.392 line:82%
She's the one who stole my heart

1060
01:24:23.476 --> 01:24:26.061 line:82%
She's the one who I long for

1061
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.525 line:82%
Looks like the base is trying to reach us,
but the radio signal is too weak.

1062
01:24:31.609 --> 01:24:34.195 line:82%
Her cinched waist attracts me towards her

1063
01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:36.781 line:82%
Her glittery accessories call for me

1064
01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:40.159 line:82%
-Her voice is as sweet as honey-Hey

1065
01:24:44.205 --> 01:24:46.999 line:82%
It's amazing, isn't it?
Such a small thing can take so many lives.

1066
01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.001 line:82%
Our lives too, while defending it.

1067
01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:51.212 line:82%
We aren't scared of death.

1068
01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:53.589 line:82%
But to kill for your country
thrills us more, sir.

1069
01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:57.510 line:82%
You want to kill people?
Make them eat your wife's cooking.

1070
01:25:01.639 --> 01:25:02.807 line:82%
Santosh?

1071
01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:04.225 line:82%
-Santosh?
-Santosh!

1072
01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:05.309 line:82%
Santosh!

1073
01:25:06.227 --> 01:25:07.228 line:82%
Ajay!

1074
01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:09.438 line:82%
Navjoth!

1075
01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.366 line:82%
Captain Ranjeev!

1076
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.836 line:82%
You are dying as a brave soldier.

1077
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:35.589 line:82%
He, who dies on the battlefield,
goes to heaven.

1078
01:25:38.509 --> 01:25:40.010 line:82%
God keep you safe, my friend.

1079
01:26:35.274 --> 01:26:37.443 line:82%
Grandfather, I am not empty-handed.

1080
01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:39.445 line:82%
Praise be to God!

1081
01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:42.156 line:82%
You don't have
just any trigger there with you.

1082
01:26:42.448 --> 01:26:48.329 line:82%
It is our decade-long dream
we have sacrificed so much for.

1083
01:26:49.038 --> 01:26:53.709 line:82%
You must get that trigger to us
at any cost.

1084
01:26:54.585 --> 01:26:56.045 line:82%
With utmost safety.

1085
01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.132 line:82%
Kill them, or be killed.

1086
01:27:00.507 --> 01:27:01.759 line:82%
Yes, Grandfather.

1087
01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:04.303 line:82%
I will meet you in three hours
at Shikara 1 pickup point.

1088
01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.180 line:82%
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1089
01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:11.310 line:82%
That was not an accident, Akash.
I was right. He was in the helicopter.

1090
01:27:11.644 --> 01:27:13.604 line:82%
Jam all the connectivity in that area.

1091
01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:17.024 line:82%
Mobile phones, satellite phones,
internet, everything.

1092
01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:18.442 line:82%
I want a communication blackout.

1093
01:27:18.525 --> 01:27:23.238 line:82%
We can't jam radio signals.
We have military operations in that area.

1094
01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:28.827 line:82%
If you can't jam them,
you can at least monitor them, can't you?

1095
01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:31.705 line:82%
Search the entire area.

1096
01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:35.793 line:82%
How far is the road unit?

1097
01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:01.934 line:82%
No! He's still alive.

1098
01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:07.064 line:82%
No matter how many bodies you saw,
how many commandos were there.

1099
01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:10.192 line:82%
Rehan will reach
the pickup point for sure.

1100
01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:13.820 line:82%
I have not given him
the permission to die.

1101
01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:15.989 line:82%
He cannot die.

1102
01:33:06.623 --> 01:33:08.458 line:82%
Rehan!

1103
01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:34.735 line:82%
Rehan, call Grandpa quickly!

1104
01:33:35.569 --> 01:33:37.195 line:82%
-Dad!
-Grandfather!

1105
01:33:45.412 --> 01:33:46.872 line:82%
Hand me the scissors, please.

1106
01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:54.546 line:82%
Who is this, Mom?

1107
01:33:55.297 --> 01:33:58.300 line:82%
Rehan, I don't know.
Please go and sit over there.

1108
01:34:03.055 --> 01:34:05.724 line:82%
Is he also dead like Grandma?

1109
01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:07.726 line:82%
Quiet! Little monkey.

1110
01:34:10.896 --> 01:34:14.149 line:82%
His pulse is quite weak. Try the phone.
Is it working now?

1111
01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:19.821 line:82%
No, Dad. It's still dead.

1112
01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:24.785 line:82%
We've done the best we could.
I'm no doctor.

1113
01:34:25.452 --> 01:34:26.495 line:82%
What can we do?

1114
01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:30.123 line:82%
You can't go and get a doctor
in this weather.

1115
01:34:30.499 --> 01:34:33.460 line:82%
Not 50 kilometers in this storm. No way.

1116
01:34:33.543 --> 01:34:36.421 line:82%
Mom! Please leave Rehan.

1117
01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:39.383 line:82%
-Rehan!
-Mommy!

1118
01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:41.593 line:82%
It's nothing, darling. Nothing.

1119
01:34:43.762 --> 01:34:45.472 line:82%
Now it's up to you, young man.

1120
01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:51.853 line:82%
We can only pray,
if you have some reason to live.

1121
01:34:56.817 --> 01:34:58.819 line:82%
It can be two days? It can be two weeks?

1122
01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:01.905 line:82%
How can you not know when
the storm will pass?

1123
01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:05.534 line:82%
I want an update every hour, you hear?

1124
01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:07.452 line:82%
Can't you do anything right?

1125
01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:13.542 line:82%
Until I don't see his body,

1126
01:35:14.668 --> 01:35:16.628 line:82%
I can't believe he's dead.

1127
01:35:29.057 --> 01:35:31.935 line:82%
Don't do that, Rehan. What are you up to?

1128
01:35:33.687 --> 01:35:34.980 line:82%
There is no heartbeat.

1129
01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:38.984 line:82%
Rehan wants to hear his heartbeat,
like he hears Grandpa's.

1130
01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:45.323 line:82%
The heart is not here, it's there.

1131
01:36:23.278 --> 01:36:25.030 line:82%
Forgive me, Zooni.

1132
01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:27.282 line:82%
I have no choice.

1133
01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:32.787 line:82%
Zooni...

1134
01:38:27.235 --> 01:38:29.112 line:82%
Do you know the cricketer, Rahul Dravid?

1135
01:38:34.993 --> 01:38:37.537 line:82%
Rahul Dravid is Rehan's father.

1136
01:38:40.206 --> 01:38:42.167 line:82%
Because Rehan's father is dead, you see.

1137
01:38:42.626 --> 01:38:46.046 line:82%
So, Mom said Rehan can choose anyone
as his father.

1138
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:48.715 line:82%
So, Rehan chose Rahul Dravid.

1139
01:38:52.427 --> 01:38:55.472 line:82%
Are you Mr. "Dependiddle"
like Rahul Dravid?

1140
01:39:05.023 --> 01:39:08.068 line:82%
Can you also be completely trusted
like Rahul Dravid?

1141
01:39:10.236 --> 01:39:13.114 line:82%
It is broken and in the outhouse.

1142
01:39:13.365 --> 01:39:15.992 line:82%
Look, look the dead man is awake.

1143
01:39:16.493 --> 01:39:18.620 line:82%
-The dead man is awake.
-Rehan, don't talk like that.

1144
01:39:19.788 --> 01:39:23.291 line:82%
When the weather is better,
we will get it fixed.

1145
01:39:29.923 --> 01:39:33.843 line:82%
Before you thank me,
come and eat something.

1146
01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:05.875 line:82%
Don't drink so much,
you will become a "hittototomas."

1147
01:40:06.668 --> 01:40:10.004 line:82%
Not "hittototomas," kid.
It's hippopotamus.

1148
01:40:10.213 --> 01:40:13.842 line:82%
And where did you learn this word?

1149
01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:18.138 line:82%
From Colonel. "Hitto... hittototomas."

1150
01:40:18.221 --> 01:40:20.974 line:82%
Hippopotamus.

1151
01:40:24.602 --> 01:40:27.272 line:82%
Would you like something?
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

1152
01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:28.690 line:82%
Captain Ranjeev.

1153
01:40:30.734 --> 01:40:31.985 line:82%
Indian Army.

1154
01:40:33.778 --> 01:40:36.406 line:82%
I didn't know there were
military operations here.

1155
01:40:37.198 --> 01:40:40.618 line:82%
There are very few of us here.
What will the militants do here?

1156
01:40:42.328 --> 01:40:43.455 line:82%
They can hide.

1157
01:40:44.456 --> 01:40:45.582 line:82%
Rehan!

1158
01:40:48.084 --> 01:40:52.422 line:82%
The dead man stinks. So, I thought...

1159
01:40:56.050 --> 01:41:01.222 line:82%
Strange, when Zooni couldn't see,
she didn't bang into a thing.

1160
01:41:02.432 --> 01:41:07.395 line:82%
And now that she can see,
she's constantly walking into things.

1161
01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:12.400 line:82%
Thank you for saving me.

1162
01:41:12.609 --> 01:41:17.363 line:82%
You were lucky, so, you survived.
What did I do?

1163
01:41:22.076 --> 01:41:25.914 line:82%
Is it just the three of you here?

1164
01:41:28.374 --> 01:41:33.671 line:82%
Zooni's mother, Nafisa,
died a couple of years ago.

1165
01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:36.591 line:82%
And left me all alone.

1166
01:41:38.218 --> 01:41:43.598 line:82%
And before that, her husband died
in a bomb blast in Delhi.

1167
01:41:45.266 --> 01:41:49.395 line:82%
I don't know why,
but Zooni blames herself for his death.

1168
01:41:58.321 --> 01:41:59.948 line:82%
When will this storm end?

1169
01:42:01.282 --> 01:42:02.742 line:82%
I must leave from here.

1170
01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:05.620 line:82%
It's hard to say.

1171
01:42:05.995 --> 01:42:08.206 line:82%
It might stop tomorrow
or maybe after a week.

1172
01:42:08.748 --> 01:42:12.544 line:82%
Don't think of leaving
in this weather though.

1173
01:42:13.711 --> 01:42:16.381 line:82%
Certainly not in your state.

1174
01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:22.053 line:82%
Rest for a while. You are our guest.

1175
01:42:23.721 --> 01:42:26.599 line:82%
Ranjeev, cheers!

1176
01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:54.127 line:82%
-Come on, it's your turn to sing.
-I can't sing.

1177
01:42:55.128 --> 01:42:59.591 line:82%
You keep teaching me things. So boring.
Tell Rehan a story.

1178
01:42:59.966 --> 01:43:01.759 line:82%
Dispenser of India's destiny.

1179
01:43:01.843 --> 01:43:05.305 line:82%
You're not a good mother.
You never tell Rehan stories.

1180
01:43:05.388 --> 01:43:06.556 line:82%
I don't know any stories.

1181
01:43:06.639 --> 01:43:07.765 line:82%
Bad Mommy.

1182
01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:11.144 line:82%
Not me. You. You're a bad boy. Go.
I'm not talking to you.

1183
01:43:17.317 --> 01:43:21.946 line:82%
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

1184
01:43:25.533 --> 01:43:29.621 line:82%
But, Mom, Rehan already knows
the national anthem.

1185
01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:30.705 line:82%
Let me hear.

1186
01:43:30.788 --> 01:43:33.166 line:82%
Thou art the ruler of the mindsof all the people

1187
01:43:33.249 --> 01:43:36.169 line:82%
Dravid, Orissa, and Bengal

1188
01:43:36.419 --> 01:43:38.129 line:82%
You and your Dravid fixation.

1189
01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:40.089 line:82%
Dravid, Orissa, and Bengal

1190
01:43:41.966 --> 01:43:43.885 line:82%
Do you know the National Anthem?

1191
01:43:46.054 --> 01:43:47.096 line:82%
No.

1192
01:43:48.598 --> 01:43:51.643 line:82%
See, even the dead man doesn't know
the National Anthem.

1193
01:43:52.018 --> 01:43:54.562 line:82%
Please tell, Mom, not to teach Rehan.

1194
01:43:54.771 --> 01:43:58.191 line:82%
The phone is dead.
Tell her not to teach Rehan.

1195
01:44:02.737 --> 01:44:03.905 line:82%
What's this?

1196
01:44:03.988 --> 01:44:05.615 line:82%
Which soldier doesn't know
the National Anthem?

1197
01:44:05.698 --> 01:44:07.200 line:82%
Why are you lying to the child?

1198
01:44:07.283 --> 01:44:09.077 line:82%
I am not here to teach him
the National Anthem,

1199
01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.912 line:82%
and I'm not here to play with him.

1200
01:44:10.995 --> 01:44:12.538 line:82%
I don't care if I lied to him.

1201
01:44:12.622 --> 01:44:14.624 line:82%
I'm a soldier on a mission,
not his father!

1202
01:44:20.046 --> 01:44:21.798 line:82%
Rehan, come here immediately!

1203
01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:03.881 line:82%
If you don't eat vegetables
how will you slay the dragon?

1204
01:45:07.677 --> 01:45:10.221 line:82%
Captain Ranjeev, come and join us.

1205
01:45:11.222 --> 01:45:13.349 line:82%
Tell us about your life.

1206
01:45:13.891 --> 01:45:17.061 line:82%
I've heard soldiers
have fascinating stories to tell.

1207
01:45:17.979 --> 01:45:21.691 line:82%
I'm not hungry thank you.
I will just go to bed.

1208
01:45:22.233 --> 01:45:24.736 line:82%
Your bed has been made upstairs,
in the room on the left.

1209
01:45:37.832 --> 01:45:39.625 line:82%
Dead man made Mom cry.

1210
01:45:41.919 --> 01:45:44.172 line:82%
Rehan, have your meal.

1211
01:45:58.519 --> 01:45:59.520 line:82%
What's this?

1212
01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.689 line:82%
Mom has sent it for you.

1213
01:46:01.773 --> 01:46:04.776 line:82%
So you will get better faster,
so you can leave faster.

1214
01:46:06.736 --> 01:46:08.905 line:82%
-But what is it?
-Poison.

1215
01:46:09.447 --> 01:46:10.698 line:82%
Milk with turmeric.

1216
01:46:11.199 --> 01:46:15.787 line:82%
And don't try and throw it in the latrine,
it stinks it up and Mom finds out.

1217
01:46:15.995 --> 01:46:19.457 line:82%
Don't throw it out either,
the snow gets yellow.

1218
01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:23.377 line:82%
And in the wash basin,
the color stains it, you will get caught.

1219
01:46:27.632 --> 01:46:28.758 line:82%
And yes!

1220
01:46:29.467 --> 01:46:31.969 line:82%
If you find some other way,
please tell Rehan.

1221
01:46:32.053 --> 01:46:34.388 line:82%
Next time, Rehan will do the same.

1222
01:46:53.783 --> 01:46:55.076 line:82%
It really is poison.

1223
01:47:27.942 --> 01:47:31.821 line:82%
If I wish, I was a roll of wool,wrapped around her fingers.

1224
01:48:53.486 --> 01:48:54.820 line:82%
Thank you.

1225
01:49:08.668 --> 01:49:10.002 line:82%
What?

1226
01:49:51.127 --> 01:49:53.087 line:82%
Yesterday, I was very rude.

1227
01:49:56.299 --> 01:49:59.969 line:82%
Actually, I'm not very good with children.

1228
01:50:05.558 --> 01:50:07.601 line:82%
I am not very good with words either.

1229
01:50:10.313 --> 01:50:13.024 line:82%
But I have a way with hammers,
give it to me.

1230
01:50:15.901 --> 01:50:18.112 line:82%
Not everything can be done alone.

1231
01:50:26.829 --> 01:50:29.874 line:82%
Rehan doesn't have a father.

1232
01:50:30.624 --> 01:50:31.834 line:82%
So, he sometimes...

1233
01:50:33.419 --> 01:50:35.004 line:82%
He won't trouble you again.

1234
01:50:39.091 --> 01:50:40.468 line:82%
He's a good kid.

1235
01:50:47.016 --> 01:50:49.602 line:82%
So have you forgiven me then?

1236
01:50:55.775 --> 01:50:59.236 line:82%
The thing is, I spend so much time alone,

1237
01:51:00.321 --> 01:51:02.406 line:82%
that I don't know how to behave
with company anymore.

1238
01:51:03.949 --> 01:51:07.411 line:82%
Like this one time, I went to my friend,
Mihir Wohra's house

1239
01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:10.247 line:82%
and I asked his wife how she likes
being wife number two.

1240
01:51:11.207 --> 01:51:13.000 line:82%
Turns out she was wife number one

1241
01:51:13.084 --> 01:51:15.294 line:82%
and had no idea there was
a wife number two.

1242
01:51:20.216 --> 01:51:24.595 line:82%
After this, I decided I would stick
to safe topics.

1243
01:51:25.179 --> 01:51:29.225 line:82%
So, I asked my Colonel
how his son was doing at school?

1244
01:51:29.767 --> 01:51:31.227 line:82%
Now that's safe, right?

1245
01:51:31.477 --> 01:51:32.478 line:82%
Wrong.

1246
01:51:32.853 --> 01:51:35.773 line:82%
Just that day,
his son had been thrown out of school

1247
01:51:35.856 --> 01:51:37.983 line:82%
for biting his teacher's bum.

1248
01:51:40.319 --> 01:51:41.737 line:82%
And not just that.

1249
01:51:41.821 --> 01:51:43.739 line:82%
When he was sent back
to apologize the following day,

1250
01:51:43.823 --> 01:51:46.659 line:82%
he ended up biting her other bum.

1251
01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:53.791 line:82%
Close your eyes.

1252
01:52:17.273 --> 01:52:20.025 line:82%
Rehan doesn't want to wash his hair.
Rehan will not wash his hair.

1253
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:24.238 line:82%
You have to wash your hair
or you will get very big insects in it.

1254
01:52:24.321 --> 01:52:26.657 line:82%
Let them come.

1255
01:52:26.907 --> 01:52:28.659 line:82%
Rehan will take the insects
for a walk every day.

1256
01:52:28.742 --> 01:52:30.035 line:82%
May I help?

1257
01:52:31.036 --> 01:52:32.371 line:82%
Give it a try.

1258
01:52:32.913 --> 01:52:35.166 line:82%
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to him.

1259
01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:42.506 line:82%
He's such a sweet kid.

1260
01:52:43.048 --> 01:52:44.758 line:82%
Why are you bothering him?

1261
01:52:46.135 --> 01:52:48.053 line:82%
But he has to wash his hair.

1262
01:52:48.137 --> 01:52:50.431 line:82%
He will wash it when he feels like it.

1263
01:53:02.401 --> 01:53:04.153 line:82%
Rehan! Look up.

1264
01:53:05.905 --> 01:53:07.156 line:82%
You were right.

1265
01:53:07.573 --> 01:53:09.700 line:82%
Everything can't be done alone.

1266
01:53:11.702 --> 01:53:12.995 line:82%
Rehan!

1267
01:53:21.879 --> 01:53:23.756 line:82%
Dead man is very funny.

1268
01:53:23.839 --> 01:53:25.299 line:82%
Don't call him dead man, son.

1269
01:53:25.382 --> 01:53:27.551 line:82%
Rehan likes the dead man.

1270
01:53:41.398 --> 01:53:43.234 line:82%
Can I help you?

1271
01:53:45.069 --> 01:53:46.320 line:82%
I'm fine. Thanks.

1272
01:53:53.285 --> 01:53:55.287 line:82%
Everything can't be done alone.

1273
01:54:00.751 --> 01:54:02.711 line:82%
You told us some good stories today.

1274
01:54:07.716 --> 01:54:09.593 line:82%
Why have you stopped telling stories?

1275
01:54:11.971 --> 01:54:14.723 line:82%
Mr. Zulfi talks a lot
after a couple of drinks.

1276
01:54:18.561 --> 01:54:19.937 line:82%
Earlier, I couldn't see.

1277
01:54:22.398 --> 01:54:26.986 line:82%
Now, I've seen too much
to believe in stories.

1278
01:54:30.406 --> 01:54:34.285 line:82%
Your family must be worried.
You've been missing for long.

1279
01:54:35.953 --> 01:54:37.705 line:82%
I never met my parents.

1280
01:54:38.998 --> 01:54:40.749 line:82%
They died when I was three.

1281
01:54:43.794 --> 01:54:45.379 line:82%
I'm sorry, you're so lonely.

1282
01:54:46.839 --> 01:54:49.592 line:82%
Not at all. Why do you say that?

1283
01:54:51.677 --> 01:54:54.054 line:82%
Your smile doesn't reach your eyes.

1284
01:55:00.894 --> 01:55:02.563 line:82%
A soldier's life is like that.

1285
01:55:05.190 --> 01:55:08.819 line:82%
There must be someone else
hidden behind that soldier.

1286
01:55:11.739 --> 01:55:12.823 line:82%
Perhaps,

1287
01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:17.036 line:82%
but, I don't think
I really understand him.

1288
01:55:19.705 --> 01:55:21.832 line:82%
Sometimes, to understand yourself,

1289
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.628 line:82%
you need to see yourself
from someone else's eyes.

1290
01:55:28.088 --> 01:55:32.134 line:82%
I could never get that close to anyone.

1291
01:55:36.388 --> 01:55:37.514 line:82%
Why?

1292
01:55:38.223 --> 01:55:39.892 line:82%
You couldn't trust anyone?

1293
01:55:42.353 --> 01:55:43.771 line:82%
I don't trust myself.

1294
01:55:46.106 --> 01:55:48.901 line:82%
And then every time,
a new mission, a new city.

1295
01:55:51.987 --> 01:55:54.323 line:82%
I couldn't be in any one place
for too long.

1296
01:55:57.701 --> 01:56:00.537 line:82%
Sometimes, you seem very familiar.

1297

Can Rehan call him "Dad"?

1340
02:00:31.224 --> 02:00:32.434 line:82%
Close your eyes.

1341
02:00:42.110 --> 02:00:44.446 line:82%
So, tell me, Captain Ranjeev.

1342

Have you ever loved in your life?

I...

02:00:57.751 --> 02:01:01.004 line:82%
I loved my Nafisa like that. She was...

02:01:02.047 --> 02:01:03.131 line:82%
heavenly!

1347
02:01:03.215 --> 02:01:05.092 line:82%
Dad, you've started again.

1348
02:01:05.175 --> 02:01:08.512 line:82%
I've told you not to drink
in front of Mom's photo.

"Let me drink on the Mosque ground

1350
02:01:14.601 --> 02:01:18.021 line:82%
or show me a place where god isn't."

1351
02:01:18.230 --> 02:01:19.523 line:82%
Fantastic!

1352

-Complaint.

1354
02:01:31.201 --> 02:01:36.081 line:82%

I have no complaints

1356
02:01:40.752 --> 02:01:43.213 line:82%
Enough, Dad, let's go.

1357
02:01:44.339 --> 02:01:46.591 line:82%
What are you doing?
We're having such a nice time.

1358
02:01:46.675 --> 02:01:47.676 line:82%
Let's go, Dad.

1359
02:01:47.759 --> 02:01:50.971 line:82%
Let me finish this drink.

1360
02:01:51.346 --> 02:01:57.352 line:82%
In this life without youI don't feel lively

1361
02:02:07.279 --> 02:02:12.743 line:82%
I wish I could hide my head

1362
02:02:13.535 --> 02:02:17.164 line:82%
Under your veil

1363
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:21.877 line:82%
And cry and cry

1364
02:02:30.802 --> 02:02:34.681 line:82%
Are you sure your eyes themselves

1365
02:02:35.182 --> 02:02:37.976 line:82%
Don't lack in tears, are dry, just dry

1366
02:02:40.228 --> 02:02:41.271 line:82%
The letter H.

1367
02:02:41.563 --> 02:02:43.607 line:82%
-H?
-Yeah, H?

1368
02:02:47.152 --> 02:02:49.613 line:82%
How do you do, dear one?

1369
02:02:50.614 --> 02:02:52.991 line:82%
How do you think, dear one?

1370
02:02:53.992 --> 02:02:56.912 line:82%
I'm just happy oh, ho, ho

1371
02:02:57.537 --> 02:03:00.499 line:82%
So, you've slipped then aa, ha, ha

1372
02:03:00.791 --> 02:03:01.917 line:82%
H?

1373
02:03:04.252 --> 02:03:10.050 line:82%
What if I let my heart live in your eyes?

1374
02:03:10.842 --> 02:03:16.640 line:82%
What if I close my eyesAnd punish your heart?

1375
02:03:17.474 --> 02:03:20.977 line:82%
What can I say in praise

1376
02:03:21.061 --> 02:03:24.564 line:82%
Of the one who made you?

1377
02:03:26.858 --> 02:03:31.154 line:82%
These nights, this clime, this river side

1378
02:03:31.279 --> 02:03:33.740 line:82%
This playful breeze

1379
02:03:35.117 --> 02:03:39.704 line:82%
Time has given us such beautiful pain

1380
02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:45.210 line:82%
Neither do you seem like yourselfNor am I like myself at all

1381
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:47.754 line:82%
The time does

1382
02:03:51.341 --> 02:03:56.304 line:82%
Our hearts tremble now as they meet

1383
02:03:57.097 --> 02:04:02.811 line:82%
Like they were never apart for even a beat

1384
02:04:05.147 --> 02:04:07.607 line:82%
But you got lost

1385
02:04:09.693 --> 02:04:12.195 line:82%
And so did I

1386
02:04:13.905 --> 02:04:16.158 line:82%
In those impatient times

1387
02:04:39.264 --> 02:04:40.765 line:82%
Now you're scared.

1388
02:04:43.643 --> 02:04:45.061 line:82%
Who are you?

1389
02:04:48.690 --> 02:04:50.275 line:82%
How do you know all this?

1390
02:04:53.862 --> 02:04:55.697 line:82%
You can't know these things.

1391
02:04:58.867 --> 02:05:00.285 line:82%
What's happening to me?

1392
02:05:03.455 --> 02:05:05.832 line:82%
I hear him in your voice.

1393
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:10.003 line:82%
Every breath you take
brings me close to you.

1394
02:05:14.257 --> 02:05:15.342 line:82%
Zooni.

1395
02:05:23.934 --> 02:05:24.935 line:82%
It's me.

1396
02:05:26.186 --> 02:05:27.187 line:82%
Rehan.

1397
02:05:36.571 --> 02:05:37.739 line:82%
Your Rehan.

1398
02:05:51.127 --> 02:05:55.799 line:82%
I could never forgive myself
for what I did to you.

1399
02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:02.931 line:82%
I promised myself
that I would stay away from you.

1400
02:06:05.433 --> 02:06:07.852 line:82%
I didn't want to cause you more pain.

1401
02:06:13.566 --> 02:06:19.072 line:82%
Perhaps, it was destiny for me to come
at your doorstep in that condition.

1402
02:06:21.741 --> 02:06:23.785 line:82%
But you kept me alive.

1403
02:06:28.373 --> 02:06:30.292 line:82%
And now, I want to live.

1404
02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:37.257 line:82%
I want to live for you, for our son.

1405
02:06:41.636 --> 02:06:42.887 line:82%
Rehan?

1406
02:06:43.888 --> 02:06:45.932 line:82%
You are Rehan?

1407
02:06:52.272 --> 02:06:55.692 line:82%
My real name is Rehan Qadri.

1408
02:06:56.693 --> 02:06:57.777 line:82%
Kashmiri?

1409
02:06:59.154 --> 02:07:00.280 line:82%
Yes.

1410
02:07:00.572 --> 02:07:01.698 line:82%
Go on.

1411
02:07:03.325 --> 02:07:05.493 line:82%
When I met Zooni, I was on a mission.

1412
02:07:06.911 --> 02:07:08.913 line:82%
And that's why you fell in love
with my daughter?

1413
02:07:09.331 --> 02:07:13.084 line:82%
Promised her marriage?
Was that all a part of your mission?

1414
02:07:14.502 --> 02:07:15.837 line:82%
That was my weakness.

1415
02:07:17.547 --> 02:07:20.216 line:82%
I was not free to love.

1416
02:07:22.135 --> 02:07:25.597 line:82%
I am deeply sorry
and ashamed about my selfish love.

1417
02:07:26.222 --> 02:07:30.101 line:82%
And you've come back
to repeat that mistake?

1418
02:07:32.145 --> 02:07:36.107 line:82%
My mission is not complete yet.
After this storm, it will be.

1419
02:07:36.566 --> 02:07:40.487 line:82%
Then, I will stay with Zooni
for the rest of my life.

1420
02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:43.198 line:82%
Mission! What is this great mission,

1421
02:07:43.281 --> 02:07:46.451 line:82%
because of which you're playing
with all of our lives?

1422
02:07:47.202 --> 02:07:48.370 line:82%
I can't say that.

1423
02:07:48.453 --> 02:07:49.454 line:82%
What?

1424
02:07:51.122 --> 02:07:53.625 line:82%
I know my silence can go against me.

1425
02:07:55.085 --> 02:07:58.797 line:82%
But I do not want to lie
and I cannot tell you the truth.

1426
02:08:00.507 --> 02:08:05.095 line:82%
All I can say in my defense
is that my love is true.

1427
02:08:12.727 --> 02:08:17.899 line:82%
I have given you a lot of pain.
Still, I am asking you to fill my wounds.

1428
02:08:19.609 --> 02:08:22.028 line:82%
I know I'm not worthy of your forgiveness.

1429
02:08:23.613 --> 02:08:26.032 line:82%
But still, I stand before you

1430
02:08:27.242 --> 02:08:31.413 line:82%
with the hope that you will forgive me.

1431
02:08:43.383 --> 02:08:46.469 line:82%
I would not have left my Nafisa
for anything.

1432
02:08:47.929 --> 02:08:51.307 line:82%
God came in the way.
Otherwise, I would've still been with her.

1433
02:08:53.101 --> 02:08:58.565 line:82%
There is no reason to believe him,
but there is also no reason not to.

1434
02:08:59.858 --> 02:09:04.070 line:82%
It was your decision then, Zooni.
And it's your decision now, too.

1435
02:09:30.889 --> 02:09:32.056 line:82%
Seven years!

1436
02:09:34.058 --> 02:09:36.144 line:82%
For seven years,
I have lived with the guilt

1437
02:09:37.353 --> 02:09:39.522 line:82%
that I was the reason for your death.

1438
02:09:42.567 --> 02:09:48.281 line:82%
Every day, I curse myself
for sending you there.

1439
02:09:50.825 --> 02:09:53.244 line:82%
Do you know what it was like
to live with that?

1440
02:09:59.918 --> 02:10:01.169 line:82%
Look at this!

1441
02:10:03.254 --> 02:10:05.632 line:82%
When you were off being a great soldier,

1442
02:10:06.591 --> 02:10:08.635 line:82%
this is how I spent my life.

1443
02:10:10.762 --> 02:10:14.766 line:82%
I was taking parts of all these faces,
trying to make your face.

1444
02:10:16.643 --> 02:10:20.313 line:82%
So that I could have something
to cry in front of,

1445
02:10:21.898 --> 02:10:23.441 line:82%
something to show my son.

1446
02:10:23.525 --> 02:10:24.943 line:82%
To tell him, "This is your father."

1447
02:10:26.486 --> 02:10:31.074 line:82%
And now, you say all those tears,
all that pain,

1448
02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:34.118 line:82%
was for nothing?

1449
02:10:36.871 --> 02:10:37.914 line:82%
No!

1450
02:10:40.667 --> 02:10:43.586 line:82%
Why should I open myself to pain again?
Why should I take you back?

1451
02:10:46.798 --> 02:10:49.300 line:82%
Give me one good reason, Rehan,

1452
02:10:51.719 --> 02:10:55.640 line:82%
why I shouldn't believe
you are still dead.

1453
02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.936 line:82%
Give me one good reason.

1454
02:11:06.943 --> 02:11:09.737 line:82%
I don't have a single good reason.

1455
02:11:13.741 --> 02:11:15.493 line:82%
They are all bad,

1456
02:11:18.121 --> 02:11:19.622 line:82%
each and every one.

1457
02:11:55.074 --> 02:11:59.120 line:82%
I was taking parts of all these faces,trying to make your face.

1458
02:12:28.483 --> 02:12:30.068 line:82%
Why are you leaving?

1459
02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:45.166 line:82%
Because I can't play cricket
like Rahul Dravid.

1460
02:12:45.458 --> 02:12:49.170 line:82%
Don't worry. Rehan will teach you.

1461
02:12:53.216 --> 02:12:58.262 line:82%
I am not "dependiddle" either.
I can't be trusted.

1462
02:12:58.346 --> 02:13:01.349 line:82%
No, you are dependable for Rehan.

1463
02:13:01.724 --> 02:13:04.811 line:82%
See, Rehan has learned
how to say "dependable."

1464
02:13:05.269 --> 02:13:08.564 line:82%
Rehan will never trouble you again.

1465
02:13:09.524 --> 02:13:13.736 line:82%
He won't call you dead man.
He will have a bath himself.

1466
02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:18.241 line:82%
He will not give you milk and turmeric,
but please don't go.

1467
02:13:31.421 --> 02:13:36.008 line:82%
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

1468
02:14:04.954 --> 02:14:06.122 line:82%
Sit properly!

1469
02:14:07.999 --> 02:14:09.125 line:82%
Eat your food.

1470
02:14:09.417 --> 02:14:11.169 line:82%
Why are you venting your anger on him?

1471
02:14:12.795 --> 02:14:16.466 line:82%
The one who deserves it has left
without saying a word.

1472
02:14:18.801 --> 02:14:20.219 line:82%
He must be in his room.

1473
02:14:21.095 --> 02:14:22.638 line:82%
Go tell him that breakfast is ready.

1474
02:14:22.722 --> 02:14:25.349 line:82%
I'm not going to stand around
in the kitchen all day for him.

1475
02:14:25.433 --> 02:14:28.352 line:82%
He's gone. He said goodbye to Rehan.
Not to you.

1476
02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:38.321 line:82%
No.

1477
02:14:39.822 --> 02:14:41.073 line:82%
He can't go.

1478
02:14:44.076 --> 02:14:45.161 line:82%
He can't go.

1479
02:14:58.132 --> 02:14:59.217 line:82%
Rehan!

1480
02:15:05.681 --> 02:15:06.724 line:82%
Rehan!

1481
02:15:07.391 --> 02:15:08.518 line:82%
Rehan!

1482
02:15:09.227 --> 02:15:10.353 line:82%
Rehan!

1483
02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:17.235 line:82%
How dare you leave me again?

1484
02:15:17.318 --> 02:15:19.570 line:82%
Your life is mine now, do you hear?

1485
02:15:19.946 --> 02:15:23.783 line:82%
You can never leave me and go.

1486
02:15:24.325 --> 02:15:26.035 line:82%
Never!

1487
02:15:55.606 --> 02:15:56.649 line:82%
Dad!

1488
02:15:56.732 --> 02:16:01.529 line:82%
When I have your hands in mine

1489
02:16:01.779 --> 02:16:06.701 line:82%
I have with me the heavens divine

1490
02:16:06.951 --> 02:16:11.789 line:82%
When I have your hands in mine

1491
02:16:12.039 --> 02:16:16.961 line:82%
I have with me the heavens divine

1492
02:16:17.253 --> 02:16:22.133 line:82%
When you're close this world is naught

1493
02:16:22.383 --> 02:16:27.138 line:82%
Destroyed in your love a triumph sought

1494
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:32.226 line:82%
When I have your hands in mine

1495
02:16:32.476 --> 02:16:37.398 line:82%
I have with me the heavens divine

1496
02:16:37.690 --> 02:16:42.528 line:82%
When you're close this world is naught

1497
02:16:42.737 --> 02:16:47.617 line:82%
Destroyed in your love a triumph sought

1498
02:16:47.825 --> 02:16:52.705 line:82%
When I have your hands in mine

1499
02:16:52.914 --> 02:16:58.044 line:82%
I have with me the heavens divine

1500
02:17:20.816 --> 02:17:23.611 line:82%
"May my life's breath find refuge
in your heart.

1501
02:17:24.737 --> 02:17:27.949 line:82%
Destroyed in your love,
may my life depart."

1502
02:17:28.741 --> 02:17:33.621 line:82%
As close as fragrances are to breath

1503
02:17:33.871 --> 02:17:38.709 line:82%
As close as songs are to lips

1504
02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:43.881 line:82%
As close as sleepless nights to memories

1505
02:17:44.090 --> 02:17:48.469 line:82%
As close as arms are to embraces

1506
02:17:49.136 --> 02:17:54.225 line:82%
As close as dreams to eyes

1507
02:17:54.433 --> 02:17:58.980 line:82%
Be that close to me, love of mine

1508
02:17:59.522 --> 02:18:04.276 line:82%
When you're close this world is naught

1509
02:18:04.527 --> 02:18:09.281 line:82%
Destroyed in your love a triumph sought

1510
02:18:09.615 --> 02:18:14.453 line:82%
When I have your hands in mine

1511
02:18:14.704 --> 02:18:19.917 line:82%
I have with me the heavens divine

1512
02:18:40.938 --> 02:18:45.276 line:82%
Let my eyes swell with tears,let me cry today.

1513
02:18:46.193 --> 02:18:49.280 line:82%
Take me in your arms, get drenched today.

1514
02:18:50.656 --> 02:18:55.036 line:82%
The sea of pain trappedin my heart will explode.

1515
02:18:55.745 --> 02:19:00.124 line:82%
I have so much pain,your veil will be drenched.

1516
02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:05.671 line:82%
As close as secrets are to heartbeats

1517
02:19:05.921 --> 02:19:10.634 line:82%
As close as raindrops are to clouds

1518
02:19:10.885 --> 02:19:15.765 line:82%
As close as the moon is to night

1519
02:19:16.015 --> 02:19:20.478 line:82%
As close as kohl is to eyes

1520
02:19:21.187 --> 02:19:26.275 line:82%
As close as waves to the ocean

1521
02:19:26.525 --> 02:19:31.155 line:82%
Be that close to me, love of mine

1522
02:19:31.530 --> 02:19:36.368 line:82%
When you're close this world is naught

1523
02:19:36.619 --> 02:19:41.290 line:82%
Destroyed in your love a triumph sought

1524
02:19:41.624 --> 02:19:46.629 line:82%
When I have your hands in mine

1525
02:19:46.879 --> 02:19:51.759 line:82%
I have with me the heavens divine

1526
02:19:52.927 --> 02:19:58.307 line:82%
My breath was incomplete,heartbeat incomplete, incomplete were we.

1527
02:19:59.016 --> 02:20:01.769 line:82%
But now the moon is full,complete in the sky.

1528
02:20:02.269 --> 02:20:03.896 line:82%
And now, we are complete.

1529
02:20:24.625 --> 02:20:26.377 line:82%
Ma'am!

1530
02:20:26.544 --> 02:20:29.547 line:82%
Give us some good news, Aakash.
Can we go any further?

1531
02:20:30.548 --> 02:20:32.174 line:82%
We'll have to wait
another two or three days.

1532
02:20:32.258 --> 02:20:36.053 line:82%
But we have to do something, Aakash.
We can't just stand around.

1533
02:20:38.597 --> 02:20:40.224 line:82%
No, not the press.

1534
02:20:40.307 --> 02:20:42.810 line:82%
We can't talk to the media
about the bomb yet.

1535
02:20:43.394 --> 02:20:45.271 line:82%
The order's come directly from Delhi.

1536
02:20:45.521 --> 02:20:49.775 line:82%
We can't talk about the bomb,
but we can talk about him.

1537
02:20:50.401 --> 02:20:56.240 line:82%
Aakash, inform the press.
Newspaper, Radio, TV.

1538
02:20:56.490 --> 02:20:59.910 line:82%
The search is on for a terrorist hidingin the outskirts of Srinagar.

1539
02:20:59.994 --> 02:21:03.789 line:82%
This terrorist is badly woundedand is wearing an Indian Army uniform.

1540
02:21:03.873 --> 02:21:05.958 line:82%
He is also carrying an electronic part.

1541
02:21:06.041 --> 02:21:10.754 line:82%
If you have any information on this man,

1542
02:21:10.838 --> 02:21:14.091 line:82%
please contactyour nearest police station immediately.

1543
02:21:18.721 --> 02:21:19.972 line:82%
Come on, Rehan, drink your milk.

1544
02:21:22.516 --> 02:21:26.854 line:82%
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

1545
02:21:26.937 --> 02:21:30.316 line:82%
No, I love Rehan much more than that,

1546
02:21:31.108 --> 02:21:32.860 line:82%
and you have to drink this milk.

1547
02:21:33.235 --> 02:21:34.528 line:82%
And what about this Rehan?

1548
02:21:40.034 --> 02:21:41.202 line:82%
At this time?

1549
02:21:46.957 --> 02:21:48.959 line:82%
Colonel? At this time? What's the matter?

1550
02:21:49.043 --> 02:21:52.463 line:82%
I have risked my life and came here
for a very important reason.

1551
02:21:52.546 --> 02:21:54.506 line:82%
What? Come inside.

1552
02:21:55.799 --> 02:21:57.676 line:82%
I've run out of rum!

1553
02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:02.056 line:82%
Destiny plays weird games with us.

1554
02:22:02.598 --> 02:22:07.186 line:82%
And if one is in the army their
destiny is not in their hands anyway.

1555
02:22:07.269 --> 02:22:08.896 line:82%
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1556
02:22:12.942 --> 02:22:18.072 line:82%
Rehan, if you like, you can come
to my house and radio your unit.

1557
02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:20.199 line:82%
You have a radio transmitter?

1558
02:22:20.282 --> 02:22:23.035 line:82%
Meet the man who lives
in the middle of nowhere

1559
02:22:23.118 --> 02:22:26.038 line:82%
and keeps a radio
to keep in touch with people.

1560
02:22:26.288 --> 02:22:29.541 line:82%
Always wonder why he lives out here.

1561
02:22:30.292 --> 02:22:33.545 line:82%
It's late today.
It will be dark by the time you return.

1562
02:22:33.629 --> 02:22:34.713 line:82%
It's dark already.

1563
02:22:34.797 --> 02:22:36.632 line:82%
Okay, so it's night already.
Come tomorrow.

1564
02:22:36.715 --> 02:22:39.927 line:82%
The weather should be clearer as well.
Come and radio your unit then.

1565
02:22:40.135 --> 02:22:41.512 line:82%
There's no need for that.

1566
02:22:41.637 --> 02:22:42.680 line:82%
Why not?

1567
02:22:42.763 --> 02:22:44.390 line:82%
He has just returned after seven years.

1568
02:22:44.473 --> 02:22:46.058 line:82%
I don't want him to disappear
for another seven.

1569
02:22:46.141 --> 02:22:48.435 line:82%
You are trying to guard a soldier is it?

1570
02:22:48.519 --> 02:22:50.938 line:82%
Rehan, do you want me to radio them?

1571
02:22:51.522 --> 02:22:53.274 line:82%
No, I will have to do it myself.

1572
02:22:55.067 --> 02:22:57.194 line:82%
Let him give his status report

1573
02:22:57.278 --> 02:23:01.573 line:82%
then you can keep him
imprisoned here forever, right Rehan?

1574
02:23:01.657 --> 02:23:04.743 line:82%
Fine, now no more discussion.
What do they say in Punjabi?

1575
02:23:04.827 --> 02:23:07.413 line:82%
-Let's have a whopper of a drink.
-Let's have a whopper of a drink.

1576
02:23:41.739 --> 02:23:42.823 line:82%
Where's your father?

1577
02:23:42.906 --> 02:23:45.993 line:82%
He was supposed to take me
to the Colonels' house for the radio.

1578
02:23:48.245 --> 02:23:49.538 line:82%
Do you really have to go?

1579
02:23:52.249 --> 02:23:53.709 line:82%
Just this last bit of work.

1580
02:23:56.211 --> 02:23:59.798 line:82%
Dad takes a while to get ready.
He will be down soon.

1581
02:24:00.257 --> 02:24:01.759 line:82%
-Dad!
-Rehan!

1582
02:24:13.228 --> 02:24:17.191 line:82%
Once upon a time, there was a prince,
and a princess who was blind.

1583
02:24:17.399 --> 02:24:19.234 line:82%
Mom, you are telling a story?

1584
02:24:21.612 --> 02:24:24.573 line:82%
One day the princess met an ordinary man

1585
02:24:24.698 --> 02:24:28.327 line:82%
who followed different monuments
in different cities.

1586
02:24:29.703 --> 02:24:33.707 line:82%
But the princess saw the prince hidden
in that ordinary man.

1587
02:24:34.458 --> 02:24:36.418 line:82%
What was the prince's name?

1588
02:24:37.127 --> 02:24:38.253 line:82%
Rehan.

1589
02:24:47.971 --> 02:24:51.934 line:82%
The prince saved the princess
from a huge, scary dragon.

1590
02:24:52.935 --> 02:24:56.063 line:82%
The dragon had a big, red face.

1591
02:24:56.146 --> 02:24:57.981 line:82%
Every time he opened his mouth,

1592
02:24:58.065 --> 02:25:00.651 line:82%
gigantic balls of fire
would come out of it.

1593
02:25:00.734 --> 02:25:02.528 line:82%
What was the dragon's name?

1594
02:25:03.237 --> 02:25:04.279 line:82%
Name...

1595
02:25:04.613 --> 02:25:05.656 line:82%
Grandpa!

1596
02:25:08.367 --> 02:25:09.368 line:82%
Come on, Rehan.

1597
02:25:10.702 --> 02:25:13.580 line:82%
Let's go to the Colonel's house
and radio your unit.

1598
02:25:14.581 --> 02:25:17.334 line:82%
The search is on for a terrorist hidingin the outskirts of Srinagar.

1599
02:25:17.418 --> 02:25:19.753 line:82%
This terrorist is wearingan Indian Army uniform.

1600
02:25:19.837 --> 02:25:21.922 line:82%
He is also carrying an electronic part.

1601
02:25:22.047 --> 02:25:23.590 line:82%
Grandpa!

1602
02:25:27.553 --> 02:25:30.931 line:82%
Rehan loves you very much.

1603
02:25:45.696 --> 02:25:49.616 line:82%
I will have to go for a couple of days
to hand in my resignation.

1604
02:25:50.367 --> 02:25:55.164 line:82%
Whether or not you're on this mission,
the IKF will definitely lose.

1605
02:25:55.956 --> 02:25:57.791 line:82%
Terrorists can never win.

1606
02:25:58.542 --> 02:26:02.546 line:82%
These people are not terrorists.
They are fighting for their independence.

1607
02:26:03.297 --> 02:26:05.549 line:82%
And who will run this country of theirs?

1608
02:26:05.632 --> 02:26:07.468 line:82%
-The IKF?
-No.

1609
02:26:08.802 --> 02:26:11.221 line:82%
Whoever the people of Kashmir elect
in fair elections.

1610
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:16.727 line:82%
It seems you're not against the IKF,
you're for them.

1611
02:26:41.418 --> 02:26:45.214 line:82%
You are a traitor.
You may be my daughter's husband,

1612
02:26:45.464 --> 02:26:48.091 line:82%
but I will gladly kill you.

1613
02:26:48.634 --> 02:26:53.430 line:82%
I was doubtful when I saw the news,
but by then, it was too late.

1614
02:26:55.474 --> 02:26:58.352 line:82%
I had my doubts.

1615
02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:03.440 line:82%
Today, I was certain when
I found this trigger in your pocket.

1616
02:27:05.984 --> 02:27:07.986 line:82%
You can't do anything now.

1617
02:27:08.654 --> 02:27:10.864 line:82%
I am going to radio the military
and hand you over.

1618
02:27:11.949 --> 02:27:13.033 line:82%
Colonel!

1619
02:27:13.992 --> 02:27:15.369 line:82%
Come outside.

1620
02:27:16.745 --> 02:27:18.997 line:82%
-Please sir, give me that trigger.
-No.

1621
02:27:19.081 --> 02:27:21.041 line:82%
All this will be over in a couple of days.

1622
02:27:21.124 --> 02:27:23.210 line:82%
Then, I can stay
with Zooni and Rehan forever.

1623
02:27:23.293 --> 02:27:26.338 line:82%
I would rather wish they be dead.
I will never give you this. Never.

1624
02:27:36.890 --> 02:27:38.225 line:82%
No!

1625
02:27:38.308 --> 02:27:40.644 line:82%
Don't you dare, Rehan!

1626
02:27:42.229 --> 02:27:43.647 line:82%
No!

1627
02:27:51.655 --> 02:27:53.490 line:82%
No!

1628
02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:04.543 line:82%
Shalimar 1, target is coming.

1629
02:28:08.130 --> 02:28:10.632 line:82%
Shalimar 1, target is coming.

1630
02:28:10.716 --> 02:28:15.554 line:82%
Hello! Shalimar 1, we read you.
Come in. Hello...

1631
02:28:16.888 --> 02:28:18.432 line:82%
My son, Rehan!

1632
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:22.227 line:82%
God be praised a million times.

1633
02:28:22.311 --> 02:28:23.520 line:82%
You're alive!

1634
02:28:24.605 --> 02:28:26.857 line:82%
Do you have what I want?

1635
02:28:28.233 --> 02:28:29.818 line:82%
Yes, I have it with me.

1636
02:28:30.277 --> 02:28:31.361 line:82%
What's the matter?

1637
02:28:31.737 --> 02:28:34.031 line:82%
I'm tired that's all.

1638
02:28:35.157 --> 02:28:36.533 line:82%
I just want all this to end.

1639
02:28:36.617 --> 02:28:37.618 line:82%
Look here...

1640
02:28:37.701 --> 02:28:39.077 line:82%
I know what I have to do.

1641
02:28:40.037 --> 02:28:41.788 line:82%
Come here and take what it is you want.

1642
02:28:43.457 --> 02:28:49.463 line:82%
The coordinates here are loc rep 34,74.

1643
02:28:50.464 --> 02:28:52.924 line:82%
Mount 2,730, 500 house.

1644
02:28:54.968 --> 02:28:56.178 line:82%
That was him.

1645
02:28:57.262 --> 02:28:59.431 line:82%
Thank God he hasn't reached
his people yet.

1646
02:28:59.514 --> 02:29:02.434 line:82%
There is very heavy fog right now.

1647
02:29:03.185 --> 02:29:07.898 line:82%
We will try and be there tomorrow morning.
God be with you.

1648
02:29:19.368 --> 02:29:21.828 line:82%
Sorry, ma'am,
he gave his location in code.

1649
02:29:21.912 --> 02:29:23.747 line:82%
We will need some time to break it.

1650
02:29:26.249 --> 02:29:27.959 line:82%
Give Ranade the code to break.

1651
02:29:28.043 --> 02:29:29.503 line:82%
-Keep the ground search going.
-Yes, sir.

1652
02:29:29.586 --> 02:29:33.090 line:82%
And continue monitoring
the frequency he called from.

1653
02:29:33.548 --> 02:29:37.219 line:82%
We only have until tomorrow morning.
Contact the base camp.

1654
02:29:37.302 --> 02:29:40.138 line:82%
Are they ready with the sketch
of the imposter of Captain Ranjeev?

1655

1656
02:30:04.204 --> 02:30:05.455 line:82%

Mom, what happened?

1663
02:30:53.336 --> 02:30:56.381 line:82%
Nothing, go watch some TV.

1664
02:30:59.509 --> 02:31:01.595 line:82%
Rehan. Dad...

1665
02:31:01.678 --> 02:31:05.390 line:82%
I've just left him at Colonel's.
They're both drinking rum.

1666
02:31:08.018 --> 02:31:10.937 line:82%
He said he will stay there tonight.

1667

1683
02:34:20.335 --> 02:34:23.213 line:82%
I am Zooni Ali Beg speaking.

1684
02:34:24.422 --> 02:34:28.218 line:82%
My husband, I thought he was dead.

1685
02:34:28.677 --> 02:34:31.221 line:82%
But he came back nine days ago.

1686
02:34:31.972 --> 02:34:34.641 line:82%
I think he's the one you are looking for.

1687
02:34:36.768 --> 02:34:41.731 line:82%
He might have killed my father
and my uncle, or maybe not.

1688
02:34:42.649 --> 02:34:45.819 line:82%
I don't know. I don't know anything.

1689
02:34:46.319 --> 02:34:48.446 line:82%
Just please help us.

1690
02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:50.281 line:82%
I am alone. It's just me and my son.

1691
02:34:52.575 --> 02:34:54.160 line:82%
And listen to me carefully.

1692
02:34:54.995 --> 02:34:58.123 line:82%
Does your husband have some sort of
an electronic part?

1693
02:34:58.331 --> 02:35:02.168 line:82%
Yes, hello!

1694
02:35:02.252 --> 02:35:04.629 line:82%

1700
02:35:21.521 --> 02:35:26.317 line:82%
I am going to tell you the most
important thing you will ever hear.

1701
02:35:26.401 --> 02:35:29.863 line:82%
If he leaves with that trigger,
if he joins his comrades they will use

1702
02:35:30.196 --> 02:35:34.534 line:82%
a nuclear bomb over our country.

1703
02:35:35.201 --> 02:35:37.412 line:82%
Millions of Indians will die.

1704
02:35:38.413 --> 02:35:43.918 line:82%
One of them can be my daughter.
Another can be your son.

1705
02:35:45.378 --> 02:35:46.838 line:82%
There will be complete destruction.

1706
02:35:46.963 --> 02:35:52.302 line:82%
And the only one who can stop it,
Zooni, is you!

1707
02:35:54.471 --> 02:35:58.516 line:82%
But, he is my husband.

1708
02:35:58.808 --> 02:36:01.144 line:82%
Tell me you will help us, Zooni.

1709
02:36:02.562 --> 02:36:07.192 line:82%
Tell me you will stop him,
whatever it takes.

1710
02:36:09.903 --> 02:36:12.781 line:82%
Yes.

1711
02:36:12.906 --> 02:36:15.825 line:82%
We have your location now, Zooni.

1712
02:36:15.992 --> 02:36:19.704 line:82%
We know where you are,
we will be there tomorrow morning.

1713
02:36:19.788 --> 02:36:20.872 line:82%
Okay?

1714
02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:47.107 line:82%
Zooni.

1715
02:36:52.612 --> 02:36:53.696 line:82%
Zooni.

1716
02:36:58.034 --> 02:36:59.035 line:82%
Zooni.

1717
02:37:17.554 --> 02:37:19.139 line:82%
Who are you running away from?

1718
02:37:21.099 --> 02:37:22.183 line:82%
From me?

1719
02:37:23.476 --> 02:37:24.853 line:82%
From your Rehan?

1720
02:37:26.354 --> 02:37:27.981 line:82%
I have only one Rehan.

1721
02:37:29.232 --> 02:37:30.233 line:82%
My son.

1722
02:37:33.570 --> 02:37:35.655 line:82%
Dad, what happened?

1723
02:37:37.991 --> 02:37:40.577 line:82%
Nothing, son. Everything is fine.

1724
02:37:42.537 --> 02:37:43.621 line:82%
Go to sleep.

1725
02:37:46.749 --> 02:37:50.712 line:82%
What's the point?
You will kill him as well.

1726
02:37:52.589 --> 02:37:54.215 line:82%
I would rather die first.

1727
02:37:54.966 --> 02:37:57.093 line:82%
You killed Dad quite easily.

1728
02:38:02.015 --> 02:38:03.725 line:82%
I didn't kill him.

1729
02:38:05.685 --> 02:38:07.187 line:82%
It was an accident.

1730
02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:12.442 line:82%
And Colonel?

1731
02:38:23.536 --> 02:38:25.330 line:82%
Give me the trigger, Zooni.

1732
02:38:26.414 --> 02:38:28.124 line:82%
-No.
-Zooni!

1733
02:38:32.170 --> 02:38:33.504 line:82%
Give me that trigger.

1734
02:38:35.673 --> 02:38:40.345 line:82%
What will you do?
Kill me as well? Kill me.

1735
02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:45.350 line:82%
I've already died once because of you.
Why not once again?

1736
02:38:47.769 --> 02:38:51.314 line:82%
Zooni, despite all my lies,

1737
02:38:52.649 --> 02:38:54.776 line:82%
despite all the pain I have given you,

1738
02:38:56.236 --> 02:39:01.324 line:82%
do you believe that I love you?

1739
02:39:04.953 --> 02:39:06.496 line:82%
Then for the sake of that love,

1740
02:39:07.372 --> 02:39:09.040 line:82%
you have to do what I say.

1741
02:39:10.166 --> 02:39:12.168 line:82%
If I don't give them this trigger today,

1742
02:39:12.835 --> 02:39:16.589 line:82%
then they will torture and kill Rehan
right in front of us.

1743
02:39:18.091 --> 02:39:19.926 line:82%
Then they will kill you in front of me.

1744
02:39:20.927 --> 02:39:24.847 line:82%
Then if they have any mercy,
then they will kill me, too.

1745
02:39:26.683 --> 02:39:29.143 line:82%
And the person to do all this
will be no stranger.

1746
02:39:30.270 --> 02:39:35.108 line:82%
My own grandfather will destroy
his family with his own hands.

1747
02:39:37.318 --> 02:39:38.820 line:82%
I don't care about myself, Zooni.

1748
02:39:39.904 --> 02:39:42.740 line:82%
But I am not willing
to sacrifice Rehan or you.

1749
02:39:46.119 --> 02:39:50.748 line:82%
This is the only way...

1750
02:39:51.791 --> 02:39:56.963 line:82%
we will be able to live our lives
in peace again.

1751
02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:04.220 line:82%
And what about the lives of those
millions that will die from the bomb?

1752
02:40:04.554 --> 02:40:08.725 line:82%
No one will use the bomb.
It's just a threat.

1753
02:40:08.808 --> 02:40:12.353 line:82%
The governments of India and Pakistan
will have no other choice, but to give in.

1754
02:40:18.526 --> 02:40:23.573 line:82%
After all your lies,
how can I believe you now?

1755
02:40:28.536 --> 02:40:29.787 line:82%
Grandfather.

1756
02:40:31.956 --> 02:40:36.127 line:82%
Or the Indian Army whom I called.

1757
02:40:46.721 --> 02:40:47.764 line:82%
No.

1758
02:40:48.181 --> 02:40:49.349 line:82%
Grandfather.

1759
02:40:53.394 --> 02:40:54.437 line:82%
You can't leave.

1760
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:05.365 line:82%
Take care of Rehan and yourself.

1761
02:41:07.158 --> 02:41:08.868 line:82%
I will be back tomorrow.

1762
02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:35.228 line:82%
Rehan! Please, for our son's sake.

1763
02:43:24.879 --> 02:43:27.215 line:82%
Rehan!

1764
02:43:35.056 --> 02:43:37.058 line:82%
Why, Rehan? Why?

1765
02:43:43.189 --> 02:43:47.610 line:82%
Rehan loves you more than you love Rehan.

1766
02:43:47.693 --> 02:43:49.028 line:82%
Don't say that.

1767
02:43:50.947 --> 02:43:52.198 line:82%
Please don't.

1768
02:44:02.375 --> 02:44:04.168 line:82%
Now I'm not scared.

1769
02:44:18.266 --> 02:44:19.350 line:82%
Rehan.

1770
02:44:24.730 --> 02:44:26.274 line:82%
Rehan!

1771
02:44:35.074 --> 02:44:39.662 line:82%
When I have your hands in mine

1772
02:44:40.121 --> 02:44:44.834 line:82%
I have with me heaven's divine

1773
02:44:45.293 --> 02:44:49.922 line:82%
When I have your hands in mine

1774
02:44:50.339 --> 02:44:55.052 line:82%
I have with me heaven's divine

1775
02:44:55.428 --> 02:45:00.308 line:82%
When you're close, this world is naught

1776
02:45:00.391 --> 02:45:05.104 line:82%
Destroyed in your love, a triumph sought

1777
02:45:06.188 --> 02:45:09.442 line:82%
It's very easy to choosebetween right and wrong.

1778
02:45:10.610 --> 02:45:12.987 line:82%
But to choose the better of two goods,

1779
02:45:13.446 --> 02:45:15.740 line:82%
or the lesser of two evils,

1780
02:45:17.575 --> 02:45:19.660 line:82%
these choices decide our lives.

1781
02:45:27.168 --> 02:45:29.211 line:82%
Rehan loves you a lot.

1782
02:45:33.215 --> 02:45:35.551 line:82%
And Zooni loves Rehan a lot.
