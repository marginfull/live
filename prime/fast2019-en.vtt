00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:58.682 line:83%
It's a family tree.

Oh, yeah.

197
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.229 line:83%
That's our family tree
right there.

198
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.356 line:83%
It's, uh...

199
00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:10.944 line:83%
it's super easy to read
and very clear.

200
00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.239 line:83%
Yeah.

201
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.284 line:83%
But I was going to use this.

202
00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:21.872 line:83%
I found it in a garage drawer.

203
00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.790 line:83%
That's you, isn't it?

204

(smacks lips)

207
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.632 line:83%
Yup. That's my brother.

208
00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:36.136 line:83%
Why don't you ever
talk about Samoa?

209
00:10:36.178 --> 00:10:37.471 line:83%
Did something happen?

210
00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.557 line:83%
In life, things happen.

211
00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:43.685 line:83%
You may not want them to,
but they do.

212
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:49.191 line:83%
You just got to do your best...

213
00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.734 line:83%
and move on.

214
00:10:50.776 --> 00:10:53.987 line:83%
And the fact of the matter is
I'm your family.

215
00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.530 line:83%
I'm your people.

216
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:58.033 line:83%
-Me.
-And you're a whole lot.

217
00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.576 line:83%
-Oh, I am a whole lot.
-(chuckles)

218
00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:02.079 line:83%
Look at this.
Perfect timing.

219
00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.915 line:83%
Oh, no, this is the mini.

220
00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.584 line:83%
-Yup.
-Thank you so much.

221
00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:09.419 line:83%
-Cheat day?
-Cheat day.

222
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.963 line:83%
Yeah. Thank you so much.

223
00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.968 line:83%
Is that really necessary?

224
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.804 line:83%
Come on!
She's 71 years old.

225
00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.222 line:83%
What's the matter with you lot?

226
00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.058 line:83%
Sir, the prisoner will
only be allowed more leniency

227
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.851 line:83%
when she proves to be
less of a security risk.

228
00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.686 line:83%
If someone leaves
a back door open,

229
00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.730 line:83%
it's a bit daft
not to try and use it.

230
00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:31.108 line:83%
What's daft is paying one of
the screws to leave it open

231
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.068 line:83%
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.

232
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.779 line:83%
Yeah, well,
my point still stands.

233
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:37.697 line:83%
If you can't break out of
a shitty prison like this,

234
00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.199 line:83%
then you're
seriously slipping, Mum.

235
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:40.700 line:83%
You cheeky bugger.

236
00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:43.036 line:83%
Speaking of breaking out,
where's my birthday cake?

237
00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:44.621 line:83%
What, the one
with the file in it?

238
00:11:44.663 --> 00:11:46.623 line:83%
-They're baking it.
-Who wants a bloody file?

239
00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:48.458 line:83%
What I want is
a nice little bit of C-4.

240
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.669 line:83%
Listen, if you want
out of here,

241
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.130 line:83%
just say the word;
I'll handle it.

242
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.048 line:83%
Oh, Decks, I'm just having
a bit of fun, really.

243
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.008 line:83%
Being banged up
doesn't bother me.

244
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.718 line:83%
I quite enjoy
the peace and quiet.

245
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.222 line:83%
You know, nice walk, bit of
reading, loads of sudoku.

246
00:12:02.264 --> 00:12:04.474 line:83%
It's like being retired.
Love it.

247
00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:07.936 line:83%
Now, listen, have you spoken
with your sister?

248
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:09.688 line:83%
You know I haven't, Mum.

249
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.648 line:83%
-Give me your hand.
-There she goes.

250
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.734 line:83%
I mean, you and your sister,
y-you used to be inseparable.

251
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.195 line:83%
What happened, Decks?
What happened between you?

252
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:21.158 line:83%
I remember you, Owen and Hattie
playing out in the backyard.

253
00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.993 line:83%
Your little games,
your little grifts.

254
00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.578 line:83%
Oh, robbing banks.

255
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.663 line:83%
You used to give
your little scams code names.

256
00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.165 line:83%
(laughs):
Do you remember?

257
00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.249 line:83%
Oh, what was that one?

258
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:30.792 line:83%
-Um...
-The Keith Moon.

259
00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:33.211 line:83%
MAGDALENE:
(laughs) Yeah, that's right.

260
00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.213 line:83%
It was called "The Keith Moon" because it...

261
00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.965 line:83%
SHAW:
It involved lots of explosive percussion

262
00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.467 line:83%
and permanent ear damage.

263
00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:42.429 line:83%
♪ Yeah! ♪

264
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.434 line:83%
(laughs)

265
00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:48.810 line:83%
That's my boy.

266
00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:50.812 line:83%
No wonder we left
the family business.

267
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.106 line:83%
She loves you, you know.

268
00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.525 line:83%
All you got to do is
pick up the phone, Decks.

269
00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:58.320 line:83%
Look at me.
You're her big brother.

270
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.322 line:83%
She looks up to you.

271
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.073 line:83%
Used to.

272
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:09.581 line:83%
Well, one day, I just hope
that I walk through that door

273
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:11.791 line:83%
and I see the two of you
sitting there.

274
00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.376 line:83%
How many years you got left?

275
00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.378 line:83%
Two, with good behavior.

276
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.464 line:83%
-So how many, really?
-Four.

277
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.718 line:83%
Well, you know what they say.

278
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.471 line:83%
Never say never.

279
00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:26.223 line:83%
GUARD:
Time's up.

280
00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.391 line:83%
-You behave yourself.
-Will do.

281
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:29.559 line:83%
Love you, darling.
(kisses)

282
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.269 line:83%
Love you, too. (kisses)

283

(music playing quietly
over speakers)

285
00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:45.659 line:83%
All right.

286
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.578 line:83%
LOCKE:
Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.

287
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.206 line:83%
I haven't seen you in forever.

288
00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:53.041 line:83%
-"Rebecca"?
-Do you even age?

289
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.252 line:83%
-How long's it been?
-Six months.

290
00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.962 line:83%
-Time flies.
-When we're apart.

291
00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.463 line:83%
What is your skin care regimen?

292
00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.965 line:83%
-Because you look like...
-Don't sit down.

293
00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.383 line:83%
...a young Shirley Temple.

294
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.801 line:83%
(whispers): Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

295
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.094 line:83%
Daddy, who is this guy?

296
00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:07.722 line:83%
Well, this guy is,
uh, is Locke.

297
00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.057 line:83%
And he works for the CIA.

298
00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:11.059 line:83%
Dad and I are old friends.

299
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.937 line:83%
-We're not old friends.
-Actually, we're, um...

300
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:15.397 line:83%
we're best friends.
Here's the half heart.

301
00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:16.731 line:83%
-I don't know what that is.
-Right there.

302
00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:17.983 line:83%
We got some ink together
as well.

303
00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.276 line:83%
-We did not get ink together.
-Oh, we didn't?

304
00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:20.735 line:83%
-No, we did not.
-Huh. Interesting.

305
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.612 line:83%
-We never got ink together.
-Well, I seem to remember

306
00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:24.531 line:83%
getting a little something
like this

307
00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:27.450 line:83%
-at one point on my body.
-Jesus.

308
00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.202 line:83%
Christ, I miss
our playful banter.

309
00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:30.745 line:83%
You have one minute
to tell me what you want

310
00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:31.955 line:83%
before I knock
one of your lungs loose.

311
00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:33.707 line:83%
You and I are
after the same thing.

312
00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.834 line:83%
Say hello to the CT17 virus.

313
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:39.004 line:83%
It's a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions,

314
00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.590 line:83%
affectionately code-named
"the Snowflake."

315
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.174 line:83%
-What does the Snowflake do?
-Oh, nothing much.

316
00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.552 line:83%
Just, uh, liquefies
your internal organs.

317
00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:48.555 line:83%
Basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup.

318
00:14:48.597 --> 00:14:50.640 line:83%
-She is nine.
-Seen worse.

319
00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.017 line:83%
-Where?
-Game of Thrones.

320
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.476 line:83%
-Janet's house.
-I've never heard of it.

321
00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:54.686 line:83%
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

322
00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:56.104 line:83%
You're never
going over there again.

323
00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:58.690 line:83%
LOCKE: But there's a new
wrinkle in the case, Rebecca.

324
00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:02.569 line:83%
The specifics are
all in the brief.

325
00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:04.237 line:83%
There you go.

326
00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.364 line:83%
-She's ready, Becca.
-She's nine. She's nine.

327
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:09.492 line:83%
This is the only unit
of CT17 in existence,

328
00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.953 line:83%
and this Snowflake
is now in the hands

329
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:14.122 line:83%
of a rogue MI6 operative
in London.

330
00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:15.624 line:83%
Dad, are all spies that pretty?

331
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:19.836 line:83%
No. She is
unusually attractive.

332
00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:22.297 line:83%
And deadly. Last night,
she was part of an MI6 team

333
00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.007 line:83%
tasked with securing the virus.

334
00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:26.676 line:83%
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

335
00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:30.221 line:83%
She stabbed one guy
in the chest using a brick.

336
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.765 line:83%
Do you know how hard that is?

337
00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:33.642 line:83%
-To stab someone using a brick?
-Get to the point.

338
00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.852 line:83%
The point is
there's no sharp edge.

339
00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:38.313 line:83%
How did she get an entire brick
into another person's chest?

340
00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:40.690 line:83%
She either had to be really
strong or the other person

341
00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:44.027 line:83%
had to have been, like,
born without, like, bones.

342
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:46.196 line:83%
-Get to the larger point.
-She stole the Snowflake.

343
00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.782 line:83%
-She went totally off-grid.
-Who's this?

344
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.367 line:83%
That's the scientist
we believe created the virus.

345
00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:52.202 line:83%
Great.
Where do I find him?

346
00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:54.287 line:83%
He's off-grid, too.
Impossible to find.

347
00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:56.081 line:83%
-Maybe dead.
-You're very helpful, Locke.

348
00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.874 line:83%
And you're
the world's best tracker.

349
00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.668 line:83%
I'm sure you'll
figure something out.

350
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.128 line:83%
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm DSS, you're CIA.

351
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.381 line:83%
-I don't work for you.
-Your boss loaned you out.

352
00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:05.799 line:83%
You do now, dick face.

353
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.008 line:83%
-What did you call me?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

354
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.635 line:83%
Let's just settle down.
All right?

355
00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:10.387 line:83%
We've already got a black site
running in London.

356
00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.555 line:83%
There's an operative there,
top of his game.

357
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.224 line:83%
-He'll be your contact.
-I don't need anybody else.

358
00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.600 line:83%
-I work alone.
-We got bigger problems

359
00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:17.727 line:83%
than your fragile ego
or the fact that

360
00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:20.105 line:83%
a moment ago I most definitely
shit my pants.

361
00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:24.025 line:83%
The entire world is
at stake here, all right?

362
00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.860 line:83%
This thing gets out,
we're looking at a lot of

363
00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.780 line:83%
liquefied organs,
and I mean, like, everywhere.

364
00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.908 line:83%
And not just yours and mine.

365
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.619 line:83%
Uh, he knows
I can see him, right?

366
00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:38.540 line:83%
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.

367
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.126 line:83%
(Sam chuckles)

368
00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.627 line:83%
So what's it gonna be, Becky?

369
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.505 line:83%
You gonna partner up?

370
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.382 line:83%
-I'm in.
-Of course you are.

371
00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:48.758 line:83%
Do you remember
what I told you in Rwanda?

372
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.677 line:83%
-"It still burns"?
-No. The other thing.

373
00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:51.678 line:83%
"Stop watching me sleep."

374
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.930 line:83%
I said, "We are not..."

375
00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:55.765 line:83%
-We're best friends.
-"...friends at all."

376
00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.767 line:83%
-And to watch your back.
-Wash your back.

377
00:16:57.809 --> 00:16:59.561 line:83%
-Yeah. I remember.
-W-Watch your back.

378
00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.396 line:83%
Lot of back. I got you. Hey.

379
00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.273 line:83%
Same old Hobbs, huh?

380
00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.234 line:83%
Same old Locke.

381
00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.111 line:83%
All right.
Who's on the case?

382
00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.158 line:83%
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

383
00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.745 line:83%
Mr. Shaw.

384
00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:18.580 line:83%
Whatever it is,
I ain't buying it.

385
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.707 line:83%
Hm, you don't know
what I'm selling or who I am.

386
00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.000 line:83%
-CIA.
-How can you...

387
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:25.503 line:83%
Sunglasses, cloudy day,
sensible shoes.

388
00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.130 line:83%
Okay, well, these are--
I have fallen arches,

389
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.257 line:83%
and I don't have
a lot of choice in what I...

390
00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:31.259 line:83%
Anyway, uh, I'm Agent Loeb,
and I need to talk to you

391
00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.719 line:83%
-about our shared interest.
-Hey, how'd you find me?

392
00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:34.804 line:83%
I got a tip from
an acquaintance of yours:

393
00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:37.223 line:83%
-Mr. Nobody.
-Mr. Nobody.

394
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.476 line:83%
Little joke for you, Loeb.

395
00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:43.021 line:83%
What do, uh, CIA operatives
and baseballs have in common?

396
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.398 line:83%
People cheer when
you hit them with a bat.

397
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.816 line:83%
No.

398
00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:50.779 line:83%
They are two things
I don't give a toss about.

399
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.697 line:83%
-That works, too.
-(car door opens)

400
00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.121 line:83%
The weapon she's stolen is not
like anything we've ever seen.

401
00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:02.207 line:83%
It's a programmable disease

402
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.334 line:83%
that can target
any DNA sequence

403
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:07.504 line:83%
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

404
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.005 line:83%
If MI6 finds her,

405
00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:10.840 line:83%
they're gonna treat her like a traitor.

406
00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:13.843 line:83%
MAN (over phone): We need you
to surrender the virus.

407
00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:15.595 line:83%
What is your location?

408
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.432 line:83%
What, you think I killed them?

409
00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.643 line:83%
LOEB:
But if you help us find her,

410
00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.728 line:83%
if you bring us the virus, we'll grant her immunity.

411
00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.734 line:83%
We've set up a black site
here in London.

412
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.278 line:83%
You've got everything you could
need at your disposal,

413
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.864 line:83%
and we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.

414
00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:36.366 line:83%
I don't need anybody.

415
00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:39.619 line:83%
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw,
but she does.

416
00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.209 line:83%
-My guy's in.
-My guy's in, too.

417
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:47.460 line:83%
Hey, is your guy
gonna freak out

418
00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:48.962 line:83%
when he finds out
who my guy is?

419
00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:50.839 line:83%
I mean, didn't they just do
a job together in New York?

420
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.715 line:83%
Yeah, but didn't they just
destroy the DSS field office

421
00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.926 line:83%
in L.A. by throwing each other
through it? I don't know.

422
00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:57.262 line:83%
Look, I don't know about
your guy, but my guy?

423
00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.013 line:83%
He's gonna get this.
He's gonna pull this off.

424
00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.640 line:83%
You know why?
We've been best friends

425
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:02.225 line:83%
our whole goddamn lives.

426
00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:05.311 line:83%
Well, my guy beat the shit
out of me at a bar in Kraków

427
00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.897 line:83%
17 years ago, and he doesn't
even remember me.

428
00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.441 line:83%
So, we all have our histories.

429
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.110 line:83%
Anyway, it's the fate
of the world here.

430
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.361 line:83%
It's the fate of the world.

431
00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.488 line:83%
The planet's population
is in their hands.

432
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.657 line:83%
-Serious stuff. -I mean,
you'd think they'd be able

433
00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.784 line:83%
to put aside any petty
rivalries to save the world.

434
00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.202 line:83%
-Mm. Mm.
-(slurping)

435
00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:23.079 line:83%
BOTH:
No fucking way.

436
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.122 line:83%
No, I'm not working
with this guy.

437
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.582 line:83%
I been there, done that.

438
00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:26.833 line:83%
Hey, the minute
he gets involved,

439
00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.459 line:83%
you can kiss goodbye
to any finesse,

440
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.879 line:83%
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.

441
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.423 line:83%
Yeah, and Mr. Arson here
only knows how to blow shit up.

442
00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:34.799 line:83%
-And the fact is...
-And the fact is...

443
00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:36.467 line:83%
-No offense.
-Oh, no offense.

444
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:39.846 line:83%
BOTH:
This guy's a real asshole.

445
00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.765 line:83%
That's, uh, "sumbitch"
in your native tongue.

446
00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:45.059 line:83%
That'd be "wanker"
in your native tongue.

447
00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:46.227 line:83%
Are you finished blubbering?

448
00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.062 line:83%
You sound like
a giant tattooed baby.

449
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.689 line:83%
You know what, I'm not
listening to this horseshit.

450
00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.274 line:83%
I got a job to do.

451
00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.192 line:83%
Tell your mom I said hi.

452
00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.361 line:83%
Actually, I'll tell her myself.

453
00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:56.738 line:83%
Don't you ever talk
about my mother.

454
00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:58.239 line:83%
I'll put your head
through that wall.

455
00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.283 line:83%
Secondly,
I'll have this job done

456
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.160 line:83%
while you're still putting on
your baby oil.

457
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.161 line:83%
Good luck, slick.

458
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.203 line:83%
-(snaps fingers)
-That's it.

459
00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.788 line:83%
You just reminded me.

460
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.417 line:83%
That's exactly why I hate
working with you.

461
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.502 line:83%
It's your voice.

462
00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.338 line:83%
It's your nasally,

463
00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:15.840 line:83%
prepubescent,
Harry Potter voice.

464
00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.175 line:83%
Every time you speak--

465
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.968 line:83%
just imagine this
for a second--

466
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:23.640 line:83%
it's like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.

467
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.308 line:83%
And it hurts.

468
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.561 line:83%
Well, for me,
it's not your voice.

469
00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.271 line:83%
It's your face.

470
00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.857 line:83%
Your big, stupid face.

471
00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.692 line:83%
Looking at it
makes me feel like

472
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:38.863 line:83%
God is projectile-vomiting
right in my eyes.

473
00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.740 line:83%
And it burns.

474
00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.241 line:83%
(inhales deeply)

475
00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:43.660 line:83%
It really burns.

476
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.578 line:83%
(chair creaking)

477
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.247 line:83%
What you gonna do now?
Throw a bit of furniture?

478
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:50.124 line:83%
For your information,
I was gonna take this chair

479
00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.210 line:83%
and turn it sideways
and shove it

480
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:53.920 line:83%
-right down your throat.
-Of course you were,

481
00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:55.630 line:83%
'cause that's your answer
to everything.

482
00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.924 line:83%
Smash a hole through every
problem in a massive truck.

483
00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.467 line:83%
But that's not gonna work here.

484
00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:01.386 line:83%
-Ah, I think it'll work fine.
-AGENT: Guys?

485
00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:03.888 line:83%
Why don't you two take a seat
and we'll talk through this?

486
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.392 line:83%
(feedback squeals)

487
00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:10.103 line:83%
Me and you, us--
I've been down this road.

488
00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:11.896 line:83%
It's a total waste of time.

489
00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:13.398 line:83%
For once, I couldn't agree
with you more.

490
00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:15.525 line:83%
Yeah?
Well, I'm doing this my way.

491
00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:17.527 line:83%
If anyone's got
a problem with that,

492
00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:19.404 line:83%
I suggest you come out here
and stop me.

493
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:20.738 line:83%
I'm not going in there.

494
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.365 line:83%
Well, I'm not going in there.

495
00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:24.617 line:83%
Smart lads.

496
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.252 line:83%
HOBBS:
All right. (chuckles)

497
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.171 line:83%
Now that we got rid of that
fun sponge, we can get to work.

498
00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.548 line:83%
I want you to pull up every

499
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:40.049 line:83%
CCTV camera
around Central London.

500
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.093 line:83%
We already have two dozen
agents scouring footage...

501
00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.429 line:83%
Don't you talk back
to me, Opie. Uh-uh.

502
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.638 line:83%
I just care about the coverage.

503
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.140 line:83%
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Now pull it up.

504
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:52.603 line:83%
Now zoom in on the area
of the heist.

505
00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.566 line:83%
-Now invert it.
-(typing)

506
00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.526 line:83%
Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.

507
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.405 line:83%
She's smart.

508
00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:04.741 line:83%
She just killed her entire team

509
00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.909 line:83%
and stole a deadly virus.

510
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.328 line:83%
She ain't waiting around for no picture.

gonna go down.

556
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:03.151 line:83%
We do this the hard way
or the easy way.

557
00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:04.235 line:83%
(scoffs)
Are you serious?

558
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:05.278 line:83%
-I am.
-Really?

559
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:06.654 line:83%
-Yes.
-Mm.

560
00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:08.156 line:83%
Well, it's a tough decision.

561
00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:09.157 line:83%
No, it's really not.

562
00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:11.534 line:83%
You want me to freeze?

563
00:24:11.576 --> 00:24:13.911 line:83%
Let me see your hands.

564
00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:15.204 line:83%
Fine.

565
00:24:16.706 --> 00:24:20.042 line:83%
But you're not gonna like
what's in 'em.

566
00:24:20.084 --> 00:24:22.003 line:83%
Think I made up my mind.

567
00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:24.547 line:83%
-You seem like a smart woman.
-I am.

568
00:24:24.589 --> 00:24:25.798 line:83%
The hard way.

569
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.467 line:83%
(grunting and groaning)

570
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:30.595 line:83%

(grunting)

573
00:24:40.188 --> 00:24:41.939 line:83%
Stop.

574
00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:47.570 line:83%
Geez.

575
00:24:47.612 --> 00:24:49.614 line:83%

-Are you taking it easy on me?
-(handcuffs click)

584
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.488 line:83%
For the moment.

585

Bet you wish you didn't
take it easy on me now, huh?

590
00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:00.434 line:83%
I wish a lot of things
right now.

591
00:26:09.777 --> 00:26:11.404 line:83%
You're gonna go to sleep now.

592
00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:14.031 line:83%
It's all gonna seem
like a bad dream.

593
00:26:14.073 --> 00:26:15.533 line:83%
It's more like a nightmare.

594
00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:17.535 line:83%
This whole thing is a nightmare.

595
00:26:20.288 --> 00:26:22.665 line:83%
All right, let's me and you
have a little chat.

596
00:26:22.707 --> 00:26:24.083 line:83%
(growls)

597
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.043 line:83%

601
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.648 line:83%
SCIENTIST:
The director called.

602
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.817 line:83%
He ordered a new baseline for you.

603
00:26:49.859 --> 00:26:52.903 line:83%
He has everything ready
for you in medical.

604
00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:55.072 line:83%
DIRECTOR (distorted voice):
Perfection is

605
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:57.742 line:83%
a painful process, Brixton,

606
00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:02.538 line:83%
in ourselves and in the pursuit
of a perfect world.

607
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.293 line:83%
Humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself.

608
00:27:07.335 --> 00:27:10.921 line:83%
-Eteon will carve out all
human weakness... -(yells)

609
00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:13.883 line:83%
...and replace it
with mechanical perfection.

610
00:27:13.924 --> 00:27:16.344 line:83%
And you will lead the way.

611
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:21.307 line:83%
I'm gonna ask you a question.

612
00:27:21.349 --> 00:27:23.184 line:83%
It's not what you think it is.

613
00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:24.935 line:83%
Do you like to dance?

614
00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:26.645 line:83%
What, the Electric Slide?

615
00:27:26.687 --> 00:27:28.064 line:83%
The Macarena?

616
00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:29.523 line:83%
No, I don't.

617
00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:31.442 line:83%
No, no, no,
I was thinking about...

618
00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:34.236 line:83%
the tango, where it takes two.

619
00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:35.613 line:83%
Yeah, don't know that one.

620
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.239 line:83%
Must be different generations.

621
00:27:37.281 --> 00:27:39.742 line:83%
(laughs)

622
00:27:39.784 --> 00:27:42.787 line:83%
Yeah, well, either way,
the music started,

623
00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:45.623 line:83%
so let's see what kind
of rhythm you have.

624
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.792 line:83%
-Where's the virus?
-Look, I told you, I've no idea

625
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.585 line:83%
-what you're talking about.
-Okay, that hurt.

626
00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:51.128 line:83%
You just stepped on my toes.
That didn't feel good.

627
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.338 line:83%
Let's try it again.

628
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.714 line:83%
I think you're better than that.

629
00:27:53.756 --> 00:27:55.883 line:83%
-Where's the virus?
-I didn't ask to dance.

630
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.676 line:83%
And why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.

631
00:27:57.718 --> 00:27:58.928 line:83%
No? How do you know that?

632
00:27:58.969 --> 00:28:00.221 line:83%
Where shall I start?

633
00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:01.889 line:83%
There's two types
of CIA agents:

634
00:28:01.931 --> 00:28:03.474 line:83%
intelligence and espionage.

635
00:28:03.516 --> 00:28:05.309 line:83%
Those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil.

636
00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:06.894 line:83%
That's what intelligence agents
look like.

637
00:28:06.936 --> 00:28:09.063 line:83%
And you look like
you could pick up a building.

638
00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:11.107 line:83%
But espionage is about
blending in,

639
00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:16.320 line:83%
about being subtle, and there
is nothing subtle about you.

640
00:28:16.362 --> 00:28:17.696 line:83%
Yeah.

641
00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:19.073 line:83%
That's good.

642
00:28:19.115 --> 00:28:20.658 line:83%
I'm impressed.

643
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:21.826 line:83%
I didn't kill anybody.

644
00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:22.910 line:83%
I know you didn't.

645
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.996 line:83%
How do you know that, then?

646
00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:27.706 line:83%
Because you can learn a lot
about somebody

647
00:28:27.748 --> 00:28:29.875 line:83%
when you fight them,
and when we fought,

648
00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:32.002 line:83%
you weren't fighting to kill me.

649
00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:33.754 line:83%
You were fighting to run away.

650
00:28:33.796 --> 00:28:35.756 line:83%
But either way, the world thinks

651
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:37.550 line:83%
that you're a murderer
and a thief,

652
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:39.844 line:83%
so you're not going anywhere or
getting any goddamn phone call

653
00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:41.262 line:83%
until you give me
some real answers.

654
00:28:41.303 --> 00:28:42.805 line:83%
You have no idea
what is happening here.

655
00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:43.806 line:83%
Then tell me.
Help me understand.

656
00:28:43.848 --> 00:28:45.057 line:83%
-I can't.
-Then I can't, either.

657
00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:46.600 line:83%
-You're wasting my time.
-You're wasting time.

658
00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:50.980 line:83%
Virus gets in the wrong hands,
that's it-- it's game over.

659
00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:53.649 line:83%
(alarm ringing)

660
00:28:55.192 --> 00:28:56.360 line:83%
(chuckles)

661
00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:02.700 line:83%
Does that mean it's time
for curls?

662
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:04.910 line:83%
Just like the CIA, always
flexing the wrong muscle.

663
00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:07.204 line:83%
You know, the mind is the
strongest muscle in the body.

664
00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:09.206 line:83%
Maybe you should try exercising
that a little bit more.

665
00:29:10.541 --> 00:29:12.042 line:83%
"There's more wisdom
in your body

666
00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:13.752 line:83%
than in your deepest
philosophies."

667
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.129 line:83%
Ooh, let me guess.

668
00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:16.630 line:83%
That Bruce Lee?

669
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:18.841 line:83%
(laughs)
No, Nietzsche.

670
00:29:18.883 --> 00:29:21.385 line:83%
'Cause I'm flexing this.

671
00:29:21.427 --> 00:29:23.721 line:83%
And all of that.

672
00:29:25.431 --> 00:29:27.349 line:83%
Come here.

673
00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:29.226 line:83%
If she moves,
I want you to shoot her.

674
00:29:29.268 --> 00:29:30.686 line:83%
Yeah, he can't shoot me.

675
00:29:30.728 --> 00:29:32.438 line:83%
-Yeah, not allowed.
-HOBBS: In the face.

676
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.732 line:83%
No, you can't, not in the face.
You'd go to prison.

677
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:36.233 line:83%
You can shoot her
right in the face.

678
00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:37.651 line:83%
No, you can't.
You'd go to prison. Sorry.

679
00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:40.529 line:83%
I want you to shoot her
two times right in that face.

680
00:29:40.571 --> 00:29:42.656 line:83%
-Okay?
-Uh...

681
00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:50.456 line:83%
SAM (over phone):
Hi, Dad.

682
00:29:50.498 --> 00:29:51.957 line:83%
Did you catch the hot spy lady?

683
00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:53.042 line:83%
Come on, it's me.

684
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.251 line:83%
I catch everybody I hunt.

685
00:29:54.293 --> 00:29:56.962 line:83%
How long have you
been doing this?

686
00:29:57.004 --> 00:29:59.673 line:83%
Because you seem new.

687
00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:05.221 line:83%
(groaning)

688
00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:06.680 line:83%
She's actually quite annoying.

689
00:30:06.722 --> 00:30:09.934 line:83%
You know, Dad, sometimes people
annoy each other

690
00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:12.394 line:83%
when they're actually,
like, flirting.

691
00:30:12.436 --> 00:30:13.604 line:83%
Where'd you hear that from?

692
00:30:13.646 --> 00:30:15.189 line:83%
(grunting and groaning)

693
00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:18.734 line:83%
Okay, look, uh,
me and the spy lady,

694
00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:20.069 line:83%
we're not flirting, all right?

695
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.237 line:83%
Zero chemistry.

696
00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:24.740 line:83%
(groaning)

697
00:30:27.243 --> 00:30:28.786 line:83%

(engine revs, shuts off)

699
00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:38.128 line:83%
I don't know.
When you saw her photo,

700
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.130 line:83%
you definitely gave the eyebrow.

701
00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:42.758 line:83%
-What eyebrow? -You know, Dad,
that thing that you do.

702
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.134 line:83%
What thing?

703
00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:47.179 line:83%
-I don't do that.
-Yes, you do.

704
00:30:47.221 --> 00:30:48.556 line:83%
No, I d...
I definitely don't do that.

705
00:30:48.597 --> 00:30:49.890 line:83%
I don't even know
what you're doing.

706
00:30:49.932 --> 00:30:51.976 line:83%
That's the silliest thing
I've ever seen.

707
00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:54.019 line:83%
Let me get going-- I got
business to take care of--

708
00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:55.729 line:83%
and I'll see you
when I get home, okay?

709
00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:57.439 line:83%
-I love you.
-Love you.

710
00:30:57.481 --> 00:30:59.483 line:83%
Hey, one more thing.

711
00:30:59.525 --> 00:31:01.443 line:83%
-(Sam laughs)

716
00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.042 line:83%
-Oh, really?
-I eat bullets all day long.

717
00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:19.878 line:83%
Oh, for breakfast and lunch?
'Cause it's dinnertime.

718
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.338 line:83%
I'll count down for you.
Three.

719
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.340 line:83%

-(gun cocks)

-Put that down.

721
00:31:25.134 --> 00:31:27.428 line:83%
Get your greasy sausage fingers
off of her.

722
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.346 line:83%
-What are you doing here?
-Saving you.

723
00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:32.099 line:83%
-I don't need to be saved.
-No, no, no, no, no.

724
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:34.101 line:83%
All right? This is my house,
and your goddamn girlfriend

725
00:31:34.143 --> 00:31:35.311 line:83%
-ain't going anywhere.
-That's disgusting.

726
00:31:35.352 --> 00:31:38.230 line:83%
Girlfriend?
That is my sister.

727
00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:43.193 line:83%
Bullshit. She's too
good-looking to be your sister.

people after you.

-Yeah, it's gonna stay that way

730
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.533 line:83%
unless you tell me
where that virus is.

731
00:31:49.575 --> 00:31:50.701 line:83%
Listen to me, pinhead.
She's gonna die

out of here right now.

We're all gonna die
if she doesn't

734
00:31:53.454 --> 00:31:54.830 line:83%
tell us where that weapon is.

All for the cause.

944
00:43:45.373 --> 00:43:47.334 line:83%
Look, honey, I have to talk
to you about something.

945
00:43:47.375 --> 00:43:49.377 line:83%
It's very important right now.
Remember how we spoke about

946
00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:50.920 line:83%
what would happen
if things went sideways?

947
00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:53.089 line:83%
We called it a "code red."

948
00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:54.507 line:83%
Well, it's happening.

949
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:55.800 line:83%
Is there anything I can do?

950
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:57.177 line:83%
You need to stay home.

951
00:43:57.218 --> 00:43:58.553 line:83%
You're gonna be safe there.

952
00:43:58.595 --> 00:44:00.555 line:83%
As a matter of fact,
we've got the CIA

953
00:44:00.597 --> 00:44:02.390 line:83%
listening in on this call
right now.

954
00:44:02.432 --> 00:44:04.392 line:83%
Watch this. Hi, Locke.

955
00:44:04.434 --> 00:44:05.769 line:83%
Everybody's safe.
Everybody's great.

956
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.021 line:83%
I'm actually at our old, uh...
our old diner here.

957
00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:12.025 line:83%
It's super weird being here
without you guys.

958
00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:14.903 line:83%
Think it's closed.

959
00:44:14.944 --> 00:44:16.446 line:83%
Thank you, brother.

960
00:44:16.488 --> 00:44:18.031 line:83%
Honey, I've already talked
to Aunt Lisa.

961
00:44:18.073 --> 00:44:19.699 line:83%
She knows exactly what to do.

962
00:44:19.741 --> 00:44:21.701 line:83%
I'm gonna be home
as soon as I can.

963
00:44:21.743 --> 00:44:23.078 line:83%
Love you.

964
00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:25.872 line:83%
I love you back.

965
00:44:25.914 --> 00:44:28.625 line:83%
Goodbye.

966
00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:31.878 line:83%
Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw.

967
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.547 line:83%
While Hobbs is an agent
in the American...

968
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:36.466 line:83%
Tell us everything you know...

969
00:44:36.508 --> 00:44:38.259 line:83%
about this.

970
00:44:38.301 --> 00:44:41.012 line:83%
My God, wh-when were you
exposed?

971
00:44:41.054 --> 00:44:42.764 line:83%
HATTIE:
About 30 hours ago.

972
00:44:42.806 --> 00:44:44.349 line:83%
Then the capsules
containing the virus

973
00:44:44.391 --> 00:44:46.643 line:83%
-are still intact.
-So we need to neutralize it.

974
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:47.811 line:83%
No, it is not that easy.

975
00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:50.480 line:83%
It's not programmed
to any DNA sequence.

976
00:44:50.522 --> 00:44:52.941 line:83%
It's fatal to everyone.
In 42 hours,

977
00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:54.818 line:83%
the capsules will dissolve,
and she will be infected.

978
00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:57.028 line:83%
Then the virus
will go airborne.

979
00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.115 line:83%
We are talking global
contamination within a week.

980
00:45:00.156 --> 00:45:02.242 line:83%
Why in the hell would you
create something like that?

981
00:45:02.283 --> 00:45:03.701 line:83%
Because I thought
I was one of them.

982
00:45:03.743 --> 00:45:04.953 line:83%
-Eteon.
-They told me

983
00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:06.830 line:83%
they wanted to save the world
through science.

984
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.373 line:83%
I believed in their cause.

985
00:45:08.415 --> 00:45:10.458 line:83%
I developed the Snowflake

986
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.962 line:83%
to be a carrier for vaccines,
a panacea for the whole world,

987
00:45:14.003 --> 00:45:17.340 line:83%
but they redeveloped it
into a programmable apocalypse

988
00:45:17.382 --> 00:45:19.634 line:83%
to attack the weakest of us,
those not worthy

989
00:45:19.676 --> 00:45:21.511 line:83%
of Eteon's vision of the future.

990
00:45:21.553 --> 00:45:24.013 line:83%
For a scientist,
you seem incredibly stupid.

991
00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:25.807 line:83%
Well, I'm a two-times
Nobel Prize winner,

992
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:27.350 line:83%
but who's counting?

993
00:45:27.392 --> 00:45:29.144 line:83%
All right, you said
the virus is programmable.

994
00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:31.438 line:83%
So... reprogram it.

995
00:45:31.479 --> 00:45:33.523 line:83%
I can't reprogram it in a host.

996
00:45:33.565 --> 00:45:35.859 line:83%
Just tell us how to get
this thing out from me.

997
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.653 line:83%
Well, there are two options,
and the first is easy.

998
00:45:38.695 --> 00:45:39.946 line:83%
-Go.
-Finally.

999
00:45:39.988 --> 00:45:41.573 line:83%
-You kill her.
-Excuse me?

1000
00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:42.782 line:83%
Oh, and burn the body,
of course.

1001
00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:44.492 line:83%
-Of course.
-Of course.

1002
00:45:44.534 --> 00:45:46.077 line:83%
-No, I mean really burn it.
-Really burn it?

1003
00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:47.704 line:83%
-To ash.
-To ash?

1004
00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.706 line:83%
-Beyond all recognition.
-Let's assume that that's not

1005
00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.166 line:83%
an option, shall we, genius?

1006
00:45:51.207 --> 00:45:52.834 line:83%
Yeah, it doesn't work for us.
Option number two.

1007
00:45:52.876 --> 00:45:54.210 line:83%
There is a machine
that could preserve her life

1008
00:45:54.252 --> 00:45:56.129 line:83%
-and extract the virus.
-HOBBS: Well, that should've

1009
00:45:56.171 --> 00:45:57.172 line:83%
been option number one.

1010
00:45:57.213 --> 00:45:59.174 line:83%
Because it's impossible
to get to.

1011
00:45:59.215 --> 00:46:00.383 line:83%
We'll decide what's impossible.

1012
00:46:00.425 --> 00:46:01.551 line:83%
Where is it?

1013
00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:02.844 line:83%
It's in the Eteon laboratory

1014
00:46:02.886 --> 00:46:04.179 line:83%
where the Snowflake
was developed.

1015
00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.140 line:83%
A secret dark-tech complex
fortified by an army

1016
00:46:07.182 --> 00:46:09.851 line:83%
in the most godforsaken part
of the planet.

1017
00:46:09.893 --> 00:46:11.895 line:83%
But if you go there,
all three of you will die.

1018
00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:14.230 line:83%
So, basically,
what you're saying is--

1019
00:46:14.272 --> 00:46:15.815 line:83%
she dies no matter what.

1020
00:46:16.983 --> 00:46:19.611 line:83%
Well, who needs a drink?

1102
00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:33.388 line:83%
It's not small. It's...
And my name's Michael.

1103
00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:35.556 line:83%
They've stopped him for what,
exactly?

1104
00:49:35.598 --> 00:49:37.517 line:83%
Well, whatever it is,
it's gonna involve

1105
00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:39.644 line:83%
rubber gloves
and a body cavity search.

1106
00:49:39.686 --> 00:49:41.062 line:83%
Let's go.

Can't believe you did that.

1111

He was gonna slow us down.

1112

(indistinct announcement
over speakers)

1113
00:49:59.706 --> 00:50:02.041 line:83%
We can't pull this off
and we both know it.

1114
00:50:02.083 --> 00:50:04.043 line:83%
It's bad enough
I got this thing in my blood

1115
00:50:04.085 --> 00:50:06.045 line:83%
that's gonna kill me
and everyone else,

1116
00:50:06.087 --> 00:50:07.964 line:83%
but were you seriously gonna
break this mysterious machine

1117
00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:10.091 line:83%
out of some high-security
death virus complex

1118
00:50:10.133 --> 00:50:11.801 line:83%
and magically get it to work?

1119
00:50:11.843 --> 00:50:13.261 line:83%
Because, frankly,
that sounds completely...

1120
00:50:13.302 --> 00:50:14.762 line:83%
You still wear
that silly thing?

1121
00:50:16.681 --> 00:50:18.808 line:83%
Didn't know you still had that.

1122
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.810 line:83%
Put the pin back in.

1123
00:50:22.228 --> 00:50:24.147 line:83%
You haven't changed.

1124
00:50:26.691 --> 00:50:28.818 line:83%
Wish I could say the same
about you.

1125

Hey, you're gonna be okay.

1126
00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:33.239 line:83%
We're gonna make this work.

1127
00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:35.658 line:83%
It's what we do.

1128
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.911 line:83%
And what if we don't?

1129
00:50:38.953 --> 00:50:41.080 line:83%
What if the only option
is for you to...

1130
00:50:41.122 --> 00:50:42.415 line:83%
It's not happening.

Yep, because I have

You heard.

00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:08.352 line:83%
Oh.

that I'm going through
all this effort

1187
00:53:16.903 --> 00:53:19.155 line:83%

trying to save the world--

1188
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:22.283 line:83%
by the way, for a fourth time,
because I'm really good at it--

1189
00:53:22.325 --> 00:53:24.076 line:83%
you think I'm going
through all of this

1190
00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:26.120 line:83%
just so I can do
the horizontal hula,

1191
00:53:26.162 --> 00:53:28.247 line:83%
sexy, sexy time
with your sister?

1192
00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:30.374 line:83%
Not all. Most.

1193
00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:32.376 line:83%
Let me break it down
for you, Frodo.

1194
00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:34.378 line:83%
This ain't 1955 anymore,
all right?

1195
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.464 line:83%
And despite the fact that
that girl sleeping right there

1196
00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:39.050 line:83%
is related to you, she's still
one of the toughest,

1197
00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:40.676 line:83%
baddest, most capable women

1198
00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:43.012 line:83%
I've ever encountered
in my entire life.

1199
00:53:43.054 --> 00:53:46.390 line:83%
And if she chooses
to look the way

1200
00:53:46.432 --> 00:53:50.394 line:83%
of this big, brown,
well-endowed,

1201
00:53:50.436 --> 00:53:53.606 line:83%
tattooed mountain of a man,

1202
00:53:53.648 --> 00:53:55.316 line:83%
then guess what.

1203
00:53:55.358 --> 00:53:58.152 line:83%
I'm gonna let her
climb this mountain

1204
00:53:58.194 --> 00:54:02.949 line:83%
over and over and over again.

1205
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:04.742 line:83%
You stay away from her.

1206
00:54:04.784 --> 00:54:06.577 line:83%
I see what you're doing.

1207
00:54:06.619 --> 00:54:08.204 line:83%
What, you think I'm stupid?

1208
00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.330 line:83%
Of course I think you're stupid.

1209
00:54:09.372 --> 00:54:10.665 line:83%
But you know what?
I'll do you a favor.

1210
00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:11.999 line:83%
I'll knock that dumb
right out of your skull.

1211
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:13.459 line:83%
You just say the word, jack.

1212
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:16.003 line:83%
You know what I want to do?
I want to do an Irish jig

1213
00:54:16.045 --> 00:54:18.547 line:83%
on your arse-ugly face
at 30,000 feet.

1214
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:20.049 line:83%

-Yeah.

1215
00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:21.926 line:83%
-So you want to dance right now?
-Oh, yeah.

1216
00:54:21.968 --> 00:54:24.345 line:83%
The only thing holding you back
is air and opportunity.

1217
00:54:24.387 --> 00:54:26.389 line:83%

And there goes the air.

1218

-Bring it on, Don Ho.
-"Don Ho"?

1219
00:54:28.391 --> 00:54:30.142 line:83%
That's enough.
Hey, cut it out.

1220
00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:31.894 line:83%
Both of y'all, cut it out.

1221
00:54:31.936 --> 00:54:33.854 line:83%
Oh, see?
You woke up the air marshal.

1222
00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:35.481 line:83%
You woke the air marshal.

1223
00:54:35.523 --> 00:54:36.774 line:83%
How did you know
I was the air marshal?

1224
00:54:36.816 --> 00:54:38.484 line:83%
-Unaccompanied.
-Late boarding the plane.

1225
00:54:38.526 --> 00:54:39.485 line:83%
HOBBS:
Aisle seat.

Golf shirt.

an educated guess.

1228
00:54:45.533 --> 00:54:47.743 line:83%
Air Marshal Dinkley
at your service.

1229
00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:49.912 line:83%
I'm sorry,
did you just say "Dinkley"?

1230
00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:52.206 line:83%
What's the problem?
Dinkley.

1231
00:54:52.248 --> 00:54:55.876 line:83%
Understand this, big fella,

Every passenger that's got

And you, Mr. Armani Pants,
you're a spy.

1237
00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:07.847 line:83%
He's pretty good.

1238
00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:10.266 line:83%
-Ah, not bad.
-I get it. We all big guys.

1239
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:12.226 line:83%
The three of us, alphas.

1240
00:55:12.268 --> 00:55:14.270 line:83%
Three apex predators
cooped up in the sky.

1241
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:15.813 line:83%
Tensions get high.

1242
00:55:15.855 --> 00:55:17.565 line:83%
What you throwing
up on the bench, big fella?

1243
00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:18.649 line:83%
300, 400 pounds?

1244
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:20.443 line:83%
Little less.

1245
00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:21.652 line:83%
Yeah, light work.

1246
00:55:21.694 --> 00:55:23.070 line:83%
I'm doing the same thing.

1247
00:55:23.112 --> 00:55:24.447 line:83%
Slanging weight.

1248
00:55:24.488 --> 00:55:26.073 line:83%
Clanging and banging.

1249
00:55:26.115 --> 00:55:27.283 line:83%
What you into?

1250
00:55:27.324 --> 00:55:29.201 line:83%
Hot yoga? Pilates?

1251
00:55:29.243 --> 00:55:31.620 line:83%
Probably mess around
in the Octagon.

1252
00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:33.289 line:83%
Yeah, you want to know
what I do?

1253

1258
00:55:44.425 --> 00:55:45.801 line:83%
What?

1259
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:47.470 line:83%

Look, all I'm saying is

You want a helicopter?

What do you want?!

1296
00:57:01.127 --> 00:57:03.254 line:83%
I want our property
out of that girl's blood.

1297
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:04.713 line:83%
No, the virus is-is
too dangerous.

1298
00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:05.881 line:83%
I-I can't.

the human body's

1302
00:57:23.524 --> 00:57:26.026 line:83%
Maybe 11 pence worth

1303

Not worth much.

1306

I'd say, all in all,
probably about three pound.

1307

1343
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:30.317 line:83%
We need to find the C17

1345

1351

1352
00:59:46.625 --> 00:59:49.712 line:83%
A Mick Jagger was a job thatrequired one person to showboat

Guys, you heard Andreiko.

1356
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.640 line:83%
They have to use
the extraction machine,

so they'll take me right to it.

1358

No, I can do it.

1359

Oh, I can handle that part.

it'll blow the place sky-high.

How do I look?

hey, when you wouldn't turn,

1582
01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.643 line:83%
they asked me
to come and kill you,

1583
01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:38.646 line:83%
and, of course, I had to
because you knew too much.

1584
01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:40.648 line:83%
But I think about
that night a lot.

1585

1586

1587
01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:48.031 line:83%
is that when you shot me,
you gave me a gift.

1588
01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:51.076 line:83%
Look at me.
I'm black superman.

1589

Bulletproof, new spine.

1590
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:57.582 line:83%

you want to fight for.

1592
01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:03.171 line:83%
I'm giving you another chance
to join us, Deckard.

1593
01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:05.423 line:83%
And the boss wants
Big Mouth as well.

1594
01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:06.883 line:83%
If not, I kill you both.

1595
01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:08.843 line:83%
Which, honestly, I'd love to do.

1596

1598
01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:14.432 line:83%
You know
what they're capable of.

1599
01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:16.142 line:83%
They rebuilt me.

1600
01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:17.519 line:83%
Dismantled him.

1601
01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.062 line:83%
Made it look like
he killed his own team.

1602
01:13:19.104 --> 01:13:22.023 line:83%
Even your own sister...
disowned you.

1603
01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:23.650 line:83%
(sighs)

1604
01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:29.697 line:83%
Just say the word, bro, say the
word and all of this goes away.

1605
01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.741 line:83%
Your sister lives.
His daughter lives.

1606
01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:36.371 line:83%
We get you some upgrades, and
we go on to saving the world.

1609
01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:43.044 line:83%
Join the evolution of man
or die with the weak?

1610
01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.256 line:83%
Just get it done.

1611
01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:50.635 line:83%
(chuckles) I told the boss
you wouldn't change your mind.

1612
01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:51.803 line:83%

1613
01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:53.179 line:83%

1626

1627
01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:17.287 line:83%
you know who you'd be?

1628
01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:18.496 line:83%

1640

And here's what I'm gonna do.

1641
01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.650 line:83%
I'm gonna slip out of these
chains and dropkick him...

1642

Are you okay?

2670
02:15:55.982 --> 02:15:59.318 line:83%
(groans) Okay.

2671
02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.612 line:83%
I'm definitely, uh,
wounded now, so...

2672
02:16:01.654 --> 02:16:03.739 line:83%
I'm gonna really need
that extraction, Big Papa.

2673
02:16:03.781 --> 02:16:04.740 line:83%
Look, I'll tell you what,
sit tight.

2674
02:16:04.782 --> 02:16:05.908 line:83%
I'm coming to get you.

2675
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:07.243 line:83%
Um, also, you know,
if you didn't mind,

2676
02:16:07.285 --> 02:16:08.744 line:83%
you could bring a couple
of pints of blood as well.

2677
02:16:08.786 --> 02:16:10.872 line:83%
-Locke... -Um, don't you want
to know my-my blood type?

2678
02:16:10.913 --> 02:16:12.123 line:83%
Uh, what's your,
what's your blood type?

2679
02:16:12.164 --> 02:16:15.501 line:83%
It's B positive,
just-just like my life outlook.

2680
02:16:15.543 --> 02:16:18.045 line:83%
-(chuckles) Imagine that.
-Locke.

2681
02:16:18.087 --> 02:16:20.298 line:83%
-Locke?
-Jesus, I'm bleeding a lot.

2682
02:16:20.339 --> 02:16:23.050 line:83%
(straining): God, I'm bleeding
so, so much right now.

2683
02:16:23.092 --> 02:16:24.552 line:83%
Oh, no. Actually, wait,
hold on a second.

2684
02:16:24.594 --> 02:16:26.220 line:83%
(laughs):
That's not my blood.

2685
02:16:26.262 --> 02:16:27.471 line:83%
No, that's not my blood.

2686
02:16:27.513 --> 02:16:29.849 line:83%
Oh, God, I thought that was me!

2687
02:16:29.891 --> 02:16:33.853 line:83%
By the way,
I stabbed a guy with a brick.

2688
02:16:33.895 --> 02:16:35.438 line:83%
How crazy is that?

2689
02:16:35.479 --> 02:16:37.857 line:83%
Turns out, it's not that hard.
