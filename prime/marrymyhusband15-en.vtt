JI-WON

2
00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:56.140 line:80%
Kill me.

3
00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:12.948 line:80%
Was I destined to die
in Park Min-hwan's hands?

4
00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:18.829 line:80%
Ji-won.

5
00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:21.916 line:80%
Ji-won.

6
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.834 line:80%
Ji-won!

7
00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.726 line:80%
Wait. Hold on...

8
00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.337 line:80%
Tell me again.

9
00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:15.010 line:80%
I won't answer Lee Jae-won's calls.

10
00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:18.097 line:80%
If he comes to the house,
I won't open the door,

11
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.182 line:80%
and call you right away.

12
00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:24.144 line:80%
Mr. Lee.

13
00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:29.066 line:80%
Thank you for driving me to the hospital
every time like this

14
00:02:29.692 --> 00:02:32.194 line:80%
and giving me divorce advice, but--

15
00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:34.613 line:80%
You don't have to thank me for that.

16
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:36.782 line:80%
It's work for me.

17
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.452 line:80%
I get paid a lot of money from U&K.

18
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:43.539 line:80%
I do what my employer wants.

19
00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:49.211 line:80%
Okay.

20
00:02:58.304 --> 00:03:00.973 line:80%
But you said you cared about me.

21
00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:12.443 line:80%
You just have to say your piece.

22
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:16.572 line:80%
Just a moment.

23
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.784 line:80%
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

24
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.829 line:80%
Hey, what is it at this hour?

25
00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:25.497 line:80%
I'm at the police station.

26
00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:26.707 line:80%
The police station?

27
00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:30.502 line:80%
I'll be right there.

28
00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:33.088 line:80%
No, go to the hospital instead.

29
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.633 line:80%

EPISODE 15

31
00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:43.641 line:80%
Excuse me.

32
00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:47.686 line:80%
Kang Ji-won, 32, transferred
from U&K in Gangnam. Where is she?

33
00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:51.023 line:80%
Ji-won.

34
00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:54.860 line:80%
Her breathing and pulse are stable now.

35
00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:58.739 line:80%
But she has a fever,
so we'll check her once she wakes up.

36
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:03.369 line:80%
It was an assault, so she came
with the police. I'll get you her record.

37
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.543 line:80%
Hey.

38
00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:14.171 line:80%
I'm going to ruin your life,

39
00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:16.048 line:80%
so brace yourself.

40
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.927 line:80%
I'll tell the media a third-generation
tycoon assaulted me.

41
00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:23.889 line:80%
You can't cover things up these days.

42
00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:27.309 line:80%
I have nothing to lose now.

43
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:29.895 line:80%
Thanks to you.

44
00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:35.359 line:80%
But isn't Ji-won too inferior
to ruin your life over?

45
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.445 line:80%
She's nothing but skin and bones.

46
00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:44.618 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

47
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.162 line:80%
Do you want some advice?

48
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.540 line:80%
Don't trust her.

49
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.793 line:80%
Do you know why I went mad?

50
00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:55.921 line:80%
Ji-won makes people lose their minds.

51
00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.758 line:80%
Ji-won and I aren't the ones
that ruined you.

52
00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:01.677 line:80%
It's your trashy personality.

53
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.142 line:80%
Look how you beat me.
Is your personality any better?

54
00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.520 line:80%
You can't do this
because you fight better.

55
00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:16.900 line:80%
That's a bit rich, considering
what you did to a woman half your size.

56
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:18.902 line:80%
What?

57
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.160 line:80%
You seek equality when at a disadvantage,

58
00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:28.412 line:80%
and strength when at an advantage.

59
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.293 line:80%
I hate using my strength.

60
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.589 line:80%
But not to you.

61
00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.552 line:80%
Mr. Yu, you can come out.

62
00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:47.639 line:80%
Let's go.

63
00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.060 line:80%
What about me?

64
00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:52.895 line:80%
Why can't I come out?

65
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:56.315 line:80%
What about me?

66
00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:59.860 line:80%
Do you really think
you can't go any lower?

67
00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:05.449 line:80%
You're wrong.

68
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.499 line:80%
No, wait. Is it because he's rich?

69
00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.375 line:80%
I work at U&K too!

70
00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:17.336 line:80%
What about me?

71
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.049 line:80%
One law for the rich
and another for the poor!

72
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:27.513 line:80%
Min-hwan is fired as of today

73
00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:30.599 line:80%
for assaulting a colleague
and violating the rules.

74
00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:31.809 line:80%
Find anything else.

75
00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.852 line:80%
I checked during his affair incident.

76
00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:36.730 line:80%
AWOL and
unclear corporate card statements.

77
00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:38.774 line:80%
And he illegally treated clients.

78
00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.735 line:80%
Good. Doesn't he have a company loan?

79
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.404 line:80%
I'll ask the bank for a repayment request.

80
00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:47.407 line:80%
I'll add assault, injury,
and anything else.

81
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.326 line:80%
And Ms. Kang is...

82
00:06:51.537 --> 00:06:52.996 line:80%
She's at home.

83
00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.707 line:80%
It's what she wanted.

84
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:58.085 line:80%
I happened to be with Ms. Yang.

85
00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:02.047 line:80%
So I left Ms. Kang with her,
but she didn't look good.

86
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.890 line:80%
You said there was a debt
that Min-hwan hadn't paid off, right?

87
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.144 line:80%
Put some pressure on that.

88
00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:16.937 line:80%
Or buy the bonds.

89
00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.106 line:80%
I'll look into it.

90
00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:26.071 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

91
00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.074 line:80%
How's Ji-won?

92
00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:31.869 line:80%
She's not good.

93
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:36.498 line:80%
I think she'll be better if she sleeps,
so I'll get her some milk.

94
00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:38.375 line:80%
There's nothing in her house.

95
00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.420 line:80%
Are you okay?

96
00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:44.339 line:80%
Well, yes.

97
00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:49.178 line:80%
Thank you. I'll take it from here.
You should go home and rest.

98
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:23.629 line:80%
Ji-hyuk.

99
00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:36.308 line:80%
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:40.437 line:80%
I'm sorry for everything.

101
00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:50.489 line:80%
Were you hurt?

102
00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.574 line:80%
What's this?

103
00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.038 line:80%
Hello.

104
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.209 line:80%
Is that all?

105
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.670 line:80%
It can't be.

106
00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.675 line:80%
Considering you called
because your husband's in my care,

107
00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:35.302 line:80%
there should be more.

108
00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.688 line:80%
How about going to China for a while?

109
00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:52.319 line:80%
Oh, my. We would be so thankful
if you could do that for us.

110
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.738 line:80%
It'll be a rough ride on the ship though.

111
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:59.576 line:80%
That's nothing at all.
We couldn't even get the job done.

112
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.079 line:80%
If you give us another chance,

113
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.040 line:80%
I'll hit the accelerator and crush her.

114
00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.792 line:80%
So just let me know.

115
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:07.918 line:80%
Yeah, thank you.

116
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.923 line:80%
Poor people always try to keep a record.

117
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:17.344 line:80%
As insurance.

118
00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.555 line:80%
What do you want?

119
00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:26.395 line:80%
Do you hate
that I'm taking care of your father?

120
00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:31.441 line:80%
Now that crushing Kang Ji-won
isn't so simple anymore,

121
00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:34.569 line:80%
you suddenly say, "Don't do anything."

122
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:39.449 line:80%
Then Park Min-hwan
suddenly asks me for a divorce,

123
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:43.078 line:80%
and my dad won't pick up, so I realize,

124
00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.748 line:80%
"I'll get screwed over."

125
00:11:50.252 --> 00:11:52.212 line:80%
Judging by the look on your face,

126
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.258 line:80%
you're nothing special.

127
00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:01.638 line:80%
Darn it. Why have I been
cooped up at home like that?

128
00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:05.308 line:80%
I ask the questions now.

129
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.144 line:80%
What can you do for me?

130
00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:19.448 line:80%
Are the shrimps in Korea poisonous?
Why don't they know their place?

131
00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:28.206 line:80%
Have the bodies of Jeong Man-sik
and Bae Hui-suk been found?

132
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.000 line:80%
I'll check the police report.

133
00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:36.840 line:80%
Make sure there's no news about it.

134
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:41.219 line:80%
Jeong Su-min shouldn't
feel threatened now.

135
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.764 line:80%
Park Min-hwan and Jeong Su-min.

136
00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.517 line:80%
Can we take care of them both at once?

137
00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.443 line:80%
PARK MIN-HWAN

138
00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:00.906 line:80%
Hello?

139
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.991 line:80%
I'm at the police station right now.

140
00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:05.952 line:80%
I'm sorry, but can I ask for a favor?

141
00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.705 line:80%
What? The police station?

142
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:09.748 line:80%
SUNGSAM POLICE STATION

143
00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.167 line:80%
We got you out, but it's pretty serious.

144
00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:14.794 line:80%
We may not be able to cover it.

145
00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:17.172 line:80%
What? What are you saying?

146
00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:20.175 line:80%
It wasn't what we agreed on.

147
00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:25.055 line:80%
If we have to fight U&K head-on,
the burden on Ms. Oh will be big.

148
00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.139 line:80%
Hey!

149
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.143 line:80%
What's with the attitude?
Who do you think you are?

150
00:13:30.227 --> 00:13:32.395 line:80%
You're not the VP of Cloud Air!

151
00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.528 line:80%
Hey.

152
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:40.946 line:80%
You're not either.

153
00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:42.906 line:80%
So don't be rude.

154
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:46.993 line:80%
Damn it.

155
00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:51.873 line:80%
You only know how to fight in the ring.
Watch your mouth.

156
00:13:51.957 --> 00:13:53.708 line:80%
You're just Yu-ra's henchman.

157
00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.253 line:80%
Don't act like you're my boss.

158
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:57.837 line:80%
Bastard.

159
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.551 line:80%
Mister, wait!

160
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.930 line:80%
Why would you give him a nosebleed?

161
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.974 line:80%
Is there a reason I can't?

162
00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:11.268 line:80%
He gave me attitude!

163
00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:13.103 line:80%
Damn it...

164
00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.021 line:80%
He's just worried about me.

165
00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:18.149 line:80%
Since your wife came
and threatened me today.

166
00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.194 line:80%
It was scary.

167
00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.822 line:80%
What? About what?

168
00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:27.200 line:80%
She said you asked for a divorce.
She won't go down alone.

169
00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.620 line:80%
She won't let you get away alone.

170
00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:35.041 line:80%
Is she out of her mind? Damn it.

171
00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:36.167 line:80%
Hold on.

172
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.752 line:80%

Work's calling me. Hang up.
I'll call you back later.

174
00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.135 line:80%
Hello?

175
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.513 line:80%
Mr. Park, I called to say
you're fired as of today.

176
00:14:48.597 --> 00:14:50.724 line:80%
You didn't come to work today,

177
00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:55.562 line:80%
so the legal team has sent someone
to deliver your written dismissal.

178
00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.609 line:80%
Where are you?

179
00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:04.321 line:80%
Someone from your workplace is here.
You're fired?

180
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.948 line:80%
What on earth have you been doing?

181
00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.909 line:80%
I am calling to inform

182
00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:14.497 line:80%
your obligation to repay the U&K
guaranteed loan is effective as of today.

183
00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:15.415 line:80%
Damn it!

184
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.840 line:80%
Why does he keep calling?

-Sir.
-What?

187
00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.097 line:80%
Why won't you pick up?

188
00:15:34.643 --> 00:15:36.353 line:80%
When the trust is gone,

189
00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:40.023 line:80%
we get a physical rights waiver signed,
you see.

190
00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:43.610 line:80%
For those who don't pay back money,

191
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.571 line:80%
which hole should we poke to get it back?

192
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.157 line:80%
Hole? What hole?

193
00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.371 line:80%
Those damn thugs.

194
00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.290 line:80%
Please.

195
00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:58.708 line:80%
Su-min.

196
00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:00.835 line:80%
Crap.

197
00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.089 line:80%
Damn it...

198
00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.049 line:80%
I did stocks.

199
00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.135 line:80%
I earned quite a lot.

200
00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:10.845 line:80%
Please, Su-min!

201
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.890 line:80%
Have some money. Please!

202
00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:20.397 line:80%
I need her certificate...

203
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.399 line:80%
Please, be there.

204
00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.025 line:80%
It's there!

205
00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.860 line:80%
Her certificate's here!

206
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:29.072 line:80%
What's her password?

207
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.704 line:80%
Su-min, please have some money.

208
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.624 line:80%
Please!

209
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:43.837 line:80%
80,230,537 WON

210
00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:45.755 line:80%
She has 80 million won?

211
00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:47.424 line:80%
80,230,537 WON

212
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.050 line:80%
Why does she have so much?

213
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.039 line:80%
She stole the money for her dad?

214
00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.139 line:80%
She's really something.

YUIL MEDICAL CENTER

218
00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:55.992 line:80%
Sue me for adultery?

219
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:57.660 line:80%
You?

220
00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:00.663 line:80%
Damn...

221
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.124 line:80%
I mean...

222
00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.502 line:80%
-Call security.
-How could you?

223
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.337 line:80%
Sir, you can't do this here.

224
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.713 line:80%
Doctor.

225
00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:10.298 line:80%
-Doctor.
-Are you drunk?

226
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.259 line:80%
I'm her husband.

227
00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:17.096 line:80%
But she was hiding here
and ignoring my calls.

228
00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:20.934 line:80%
And she sued me for adultery.

229
00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.228 line:80%
Without evidence.

230
00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.188 line:80%
I have it.

231
00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:28.483 line:80%
Do you really want to do this here?

232
00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.901 line:80%
At the hospital?

233
00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.528 line:80%
What do you have?

234
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.947 line:80%
The dashcam recording?

235
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.241 line:80%
There's no video.

236
00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:40.370 line:80%
Ju-ran.

237
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.873 line:80%
Ju-ran!

238
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.295 line:80%
You can't divorce me with that!

239
00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:52.173 line:80%
You must have the video. Hard evidence.

240
00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:54.092 line:80%
-Let's get you outside.
-Come on.

241
00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:57.595 line:80%
Yeon-ji will be fatherless because of you.

242
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.687 line:80%
Who are you? What's going on? Let go!

243
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.898 line:80%
Did you even read the divorce papers?

244
00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:11.609 line:80%
Lee Seok-jun.

245
00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.362 line:80%
I'm Ms. Yang Ju-ran's lawyer.

246
00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:16.573 line:80%
Lawyer?

247
00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.533 line:80%
I'll apply for a restraining order.

248
00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:24.122 line:80%
Never come back.

249
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.252 line:80%
Are you okay?

250
00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:30.920 line:80%
Yes.

251
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:36.175 line:80%
The doctor is good
and confident about the surgery,

252
00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.052 line:80%
-so don't worry.
-Right.

253
00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.721 line:80%
Is Ji-won okay?

254
00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.060 line:80%
As far as I know, yes.

255
00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:52.692 line:80%
But you should worry about yourself.

256
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.331 line:80%
It's been a while.

257
00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:11.127 line:80%
I was so surprised to get your call.

258
00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:15.548 line:80%
It's nice to see you after so long.

259
00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:17.842 line:80%
Can I take your order?

260
00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:20.428 line:80%
Have you been well?

261
00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:23.640 line:80%
Yes, I have.

262
00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:33.149 line:80%
To be honest, I'm not doing that well.

263
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:39.155 line:80%
Min-hwan and I are getting a divorce.

264
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:42.492 line:80%
I left the house yesterday.
I'm staying upstairs.

265
00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.243 line:80%
I'm going to rest for now.

266
00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:49.832 line:80%
It must be karma.

267
00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.422 line:80%
Blinded by love, I betrayed

268
00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.008 line:80%
my only best friend.

269
00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:02.887 line:80%
In the end...

270
00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:08.977 line:80%
Anyway, I'm all alone now.

271
00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:13.898 line:80%
The divorce makes this easier to say.

272
00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:20.446 line:80%
Did you try to kill Ji-won?

273
00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:33.459 line:80%
I would've done the same.

274
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.131 line:80%
I'm saying I know Ji-won and Min-hwan are

275
00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.259 line:80%
seeing each other again.

276
00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:44.429 line:80%
Are they really...

277
00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:47.557 line:80%
seeing each other again?

278
00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.355 line:80%
Let's charge them with adultery.

279
00:21:55.898 --> 00:21:59.027 line:80%
I'll let you know when and where to go.

280
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.779 line:80%
If you want,
I'll get you the best lawyer too.

281
00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:07.326 line:80%
You just fulfill your role
as his legal spouse.

282
00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.084 line:80%
Why?

283
00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:17.587 line:80%
Because it's not fair.

284
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.466 line:80%
Isn't your life ruined
because of Min-hwan?

285
00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:29.390 line:80%
If you divorce, you won't be rewarded
for your work at the company.

286
00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:31.851 line:80%
You'll be left with nothing.

287
00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:33.853 line:80%
That's true...

288
00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:36.397 line:80%
for me.

289
00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.277 line:80%
But what do you gain?

290
00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:54.832 line:80%
I want to get Kang Ji-won back.

291
00:22:58.294 --> 00:22:59.921 line:80%
I like Ji-won.

292
00:23:01.756 --> 00:23:03.883 line:80%
So I hate that she's with him.

293
00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:08.763 line:80%
I'm going to make her come back to me.

294
00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:12.683 line:80%
So help me.

295
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:27.990 line:80%
Can I ask you something?

296
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.206 line:80%
Why do you hate me?

297
00:23:40.378 --> 00:23:41.796 line:80%
Because you're selfish.

298
00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:45.967 line:80%
There are those
who gnaw at people around them.

299
00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:50.805 line:80%
You are that type, so I hate you.

300
00:23:53.307 --> 00:23:55.309 line:80%
You don't know me that well.

301
00:23:55.393 --> 00:23:57.228 line:80%
You don't trust anyone, do you?

302
00:23:58.229 --> 00:24:00.481 line:80%
That's because you're not trustworthy.

303
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:06.779 line:80%
You think everyone's like you,
so you can't trust anyone.

304
00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:11.742 line:80%
How can you work with me
thinking like that?

305
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.205 line:80%
Didn't you ask me why I hated you?

306
00:24:16.706 --> 00:24:18.958 line:80%
I never said I couldn't work with you.

307
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:23.337 line:80%
Let me know when you decide.

308
00:24:33.431 --> 00:24:35.474 line:80%
It went well.

309
00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:39.061 line:80%
As you said,
she asked me why I was helping her.

310
00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:44.984 line:80%
I didn't think she'd believe me if I lied,
so I mixed in some truth.

311
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:54.493 line:80%
Except that it'll be
Oh Yu-ra and Park Min-hwan instead,

312
00:24:54.577 --> 00:24:56.370 line:80%
everything I said was true.

313
00:24:57.246 --> 00:24:58.247 line:80%
Also...

314
00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:03.419 line:80%
There's an insurance policy
provided to company employees.

315
00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:04.629 line:80%
A family insurance.

316
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.008 line:80%
It compensates yourself, spouse,
and immediate family.

317
00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:12.136 line:80%
You can decide to keep it when you quit.

318
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.346 line:80%
SECOND HAND MARKET

319
00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:16.224 line:80%
A notice will go to Park Min-hwan soon.

320
00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:25.024 line:80%
I can take care of the more urgent debt
if this gets sold.

321
00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:29.487 line:80%
He doesn't know such insurance existed,

322
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.113 line:80%
but he will soon.

323
00:25:32.615 --> 00:25:34.075 line:80%
The stage is being set.

324
00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:04.021 line:80%
Shall I just die?

325
00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:08.150 line:80%
Though it's useless
if Min-hwan doesn't decide to die.

326
00:26:08.234 --> 00:26:09.485 line:80%
If I die...

327
00:26:12.655 --> 00:26:15.616 line:80%
my mom and dad can get
my life insurance benefit.

328
00:26:19.287 --> 00:26:23.124 line:80%
Min-hwan could've stopped several times
on his way here,

329
00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:25.793 line:80%
but he didn't.

330
00:26:27.878 --> 00:26:29.588 line:80%
He'll go all the way.

331
00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:32.216 line:80%
Then there's no problem.

332
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.261 line:80%
Jeong Su-min will go all the way too.

333
00:26:40.433 --> 00:26:42.393 line:80%
Why is everyone

334
00:26:42.476 --> 00:26:44.270 line:80%
looking for Kang Ji-won?

335
00:26:46.188 --> 00:26:49.608 line:80%
I think Jeong Su-min is
more obsessed with you right now.

336
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.990 line:80%
It's that moment now.

337
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.747 line:80%
All that's left
is for her to experience it.

338
00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:26.145 line:80%
How about returning to Japan?

339
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.400 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk is moving more actively
than before.

340
00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:33.486 line:80%
He's pressuring Park Min-hwan

341
00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:36.697 line:80%
with his debt and private loans.
He won't last long.

342
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:39.950 line:80%
And he hasn't given up
on Man-sik and Hui-suk.

343
00:27:40.034 --> 00:27:43.287 line:80%
He got all the CCTV footage
from the abandoned factory.

344
00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:44.830 line:80%
He won't find anything,

345
00:27:44.914 --> 00:27:48.042 line:80%
but nothing good can come
from fighting U&K head-on.

346
00:27:56.717 --> 00:27:58.260 line:80%
You must not be confident.

347
00:27:58.344 --> 00:28:01.097 line:80%
Seeing how you're telling me to run away.

348
00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:05.267 line:80%
It's okay.

349
00:28:06.352 --> 00:28:09.480 line:80%
His grandfather is different.

350
00:28:10.773 --> 00:28:13.901 line:80%
Unlike Ji-hyuk,
who's like a flower in a green house,

351
00:28:13.984 --> 00:28:15.569 line:80%
he's realistic.

352
00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:20.366 line:80%
He knows how much
of a nuisance Cinderella can be.

353
00:28:39.677 --> 00:28:41.095 line:80%
Checkmate.

354
00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:46.016 line:80%
I can never beat you.

355
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.395 line:80%
You want everything,
so I can read your hand.

356
00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:54.442 line:80%
A good leader should know how to
give up something that's not theirs.

357
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:56.819 line:80%
Okay.

358
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.198 line:80%
Hey!

359
00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:04.827 line:80%
Hi.

360
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.912 line:80%
We were just playing
janggi
.

361
00:29:06.996 --> 00:29:08.747 line:80%
And I lost again.

362
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.461 line:80%
But I think I can beat you.
Do you want to play?

363
00:29:15.546 --> 00:29:16.547 line:80%
Grandfather.

364
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.924 line:80%
You asked me to bring the woman I like.

365
00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:22.136 line:80%
I will introduce her to you.

366
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.140 line:80%
So don't let Yu-ra into the house anymore.

367
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.269 line:80%
You said it was one-sided
and weren't going to make it work.

368
00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:31.854 line:80%
Did you change your mind?

369
00:29:32.354 --> 00:29:34.064 line:80%
Yes, I'm going to pursue it.

370
00:29:35.816 --> 00:29:38.569 line:80%
So I can't have
my ex-fiancée frequenting my house.

371
00:29:42.364 --> 00:29:45.201 line:80%
I was so indifferent
during our engagement.

372
00:29:45.284 --> 00:29:48.496 line:80%
I didn't know he was so impatient.

373
00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:50.498 line:80%
People like us

374
00:29:50.581 --> 00:29:53.334 line:80%
can't marry for love, can we?

375
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:57.338 line:80%
Get permission from your grandfather
before you--

376
00:29:57.421 --> 00:29:58.255 line:80%
I will.

377
00:29:59.423 --> 00:30:00.799 line:80%
I'll introduce her now.

378
00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:21.111 line:80%
Hello, I'm Kang Ji-won.

379
00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:35.376 line:80%
Let's get rid of Kang Ji-won.

380
00:30:36.377 --> 00:30:38.212 line:80%
You're not going back to Japan?

381
00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:40.381 line:80%
I can't live with myself if I lose.

382
00:30:40.881 --> 00:30:44.426 line:80%
Why do I have to feel this way
over those cockroaches?

383
00:30:45.511 --> 00:30:48.597 line:80%
Yeah, I should've done it myself.

384
00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:51.350 line:80%
It's a headache having others do it.

385
00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:12.663 line:80%
I've decided to face the obstacles
that are bound to happen.

386
00:31:21.714 --> 00:31:24.174 line:80%
When I met you last time,

387
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:28.095 line:80%
there's something I didn't tell you.

388
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:33.767 line:80%
Powering through
isn't a solution to everything.

389
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.315 line:80%
I'm aware he gave you a lot
for seeing him briefly.

390
00:31:39.398 --> 00:31:42.985 line:80%
So what are you going to do from now on?

391
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:46.864 line:80%
I'll look back and reflect on my faults.

392
00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.450 line:80%
I'll correct what I can.

393
00:31:50.034 --> 00:31:51.160 line:80%
And the rest...

394
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.039 line:80%
I guess it is what it is.

395
00:31:56.123 --> 00:32:02.087 line:80%
It's time for you to step back and say,
"It is what it is."

396
00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:08.260 line:80%
So you knew.

397
00:32:12.973 --> 00:32:15.309 line:80%
I gave him hell for that.

398
00:32:16.477 --> 00:32:18.604 line:80%
That won't ever happen again.

399
00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.734 line:80%
He lacks so much.

400
00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:27.446 line:80%
You spoiled him.

401
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:30.866 line:80%
He only knows how to work.
He has no concept of money.

402
00:32:32.201 --> 00:32:35.871 line:80%
Honestly, I was flustered
because he was like a rich boy.

403
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.083 line:80%
What are you trying to say?

404
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:46.507 line:80%
But I liked that about him.

405
00:32:48.384 --> 00:32:51.261 line:80%
To tell you the truth, I lack a lot too.

406
00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.558 line:80%
When I thought he was
a perfect third-generation
chaebol
,

407
00:32:56.642 --> 00:32:59.061 line:80%
he seemed unreachable.

408
00:33:01.855 --> 00:33:05.192 line:80%
But he can be foolish, get angry,
and messy.

409
00:33:06.068 --> 00:33:08.278 line:80%
He gets embarrassed, and sometimes...

410
00:33:09.863 --> 00:33:12.616 line:80%
he acts like a baby.
Seeing those sides of him,

411
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:18.956 line:80%
I thought we could do well together.

412
00:33:25.963 --> 00:33:28.465 line:80%
I want to be happy with him.

413
00:33:32.428 --> 00:33:33.512 line:80%
Sir.

414
00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:39.643 line:80%
Please, give Yu Ji-hyuk to me.

415
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:54.533 line:80%
Park Min-hwan's termination
will be finalized by tomorrow.

416
00:33:55.576 --> 00:33:59.955 line:80%
By the way, why did you ask
about the insurance for employees?

417
00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.790 line:80%
They don't usually keep it.

418
00:34:01.874 --> 00:34:05.043 line:80%
It's just a company perk.
Most don't know about it.

419
00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:08.046 line:80%
Park Min-hwan will do it.

420
00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.157 line:80%
That looks good.

421
00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:36.867 line:80%
Three.

422
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:38.619 line:80%
How's the taste and texture?

423
00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:46.418 line:80%
As you predicted, the spinach pasta
with sea snails was most popular.

424
00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:48.045 line:80%
It'll be the main product.

425
00:34:48.921 --> 00:34:49.922 line:80%
That's good.

426
00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:54.468 line:80%
Sea snails and spinach aren't
common ingredients for pasta in Korea...

427
00:34:55.177 --> 00:34:56.428 line:80%
Oh, right.

428
00:34:56.512 --> 00:34:57.805 line:80%
Look at the camera.

429
00:34:57.888 --> 00:34:58.972 line:80%
Okay.

430
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.434 line:80%
Yes, that's good.

431
00:35:02.518 --> 00:35:04.019 line:80%
Just be comfortable.

432
00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:06.271 line:80%
He's going to get a natural look.

433
00:35:09.358 --> 00:35:12.820 line:80%
YU HUI-YEON

434
00:35:20.828 --> 00:35:22.538 line:80%
Great job today.

435
00:35:22.621 --> 00:35:27.167 line:80%
It was nothing. You saved me
from being unemployed. I appreciate it.

436
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:30.629 line:80%
I'll send you the recipe revisions soon.

437
00:35:30.712 --> 00:35:32.089 line:80%
-It's hard.
-Yeah.

438
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:35.342 line:80%
I'll send you the draft
and factory schedule too.

439
00:35:35.843 --> 00:35:36.677 line:80%
Okay.

440
00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:38.804 line:80%
By the way,

441
00:35:40.013 --> 00:35:44.685 line:80%
I didn't see Yu Hui-yeon
and Yu Ji-hyuk today.

442
00:35:46.228 --> 00:35:48.605 line:80%
Mr. Yu was there all day.

443
00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:51.483 line:80%
I haven't seen Hui-yeon either.

444
00:35:51.567 --> 00:35:52.818 line:80%
Where did she go?

445
00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:57.447 line:80%
I should get going.

446
00:35:59.032 --> 00:36:00.242 line:80%
-Goodbye!
-Bye!

447
00:36:09.543 --> 00:36:10.586 line:80%
JEONG SU-MIN

448
00:36:13.672 --> 00:36:14.590 line:80%
CALL DECLINED

449
00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:22.180 line:80%
JEONG SU-MIN

450
00:36:22.264 --> 00:36:23.098 line:80%
CALL DECLINED

451
00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:39.698 line:80%
Why not pick up my calls?

452
00:36:40.908 --> 00:36:42.284 line:80%
Why won't you pick up?

453
00:36:43.452 --> 00:36:46.121 line:80%
Why do I have to pick up your calls?

454
00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:53.086 line:80%
Yeah, I get it.

455
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:57.049 line:80%
You were with him for seven years,
but he chose me over you.

456
00:36:57.132 --> 00:36:58.926 line:80%
I'm sure it was hard to accept.

457
00:36:59.009 --> 00:37:00.677 line:80%
But still,

458
00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:06.558 line:80%
how could you seduce a married man?
I'm about to get divorced because of you.

459
00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:16.026 line:80%
Is this security?

460
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.028 line:80%
This is the 16th floor.

461
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.113 line:80%
An outsider is here.

462
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:21.907 line:80%
Take care of her.

463
00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:25.786 line:80%
What are you doing?

464
00:37:26.453 --> 00:37:28.246 line:80%
Do you think I'd let it slide?

465
00:37:29.623 --> 00:37:30.457 line:80%
Hey.

466
00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:35.629 line:80%
Why would I sleep with someone else's man?
I'm not you.

467
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:42.803 line:80%
Right, you seduced Min-hwan this way,
so I'm sure you know best.

468
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:49.643 line:80%
But if he betrayed
his girlfriend of seven years,

469
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:53.397 line:80%
why didn't you know
he could do the same to you?

470
00:37:55.774 --> 00:38:00.821 line:80%
I'll put posters up here to make you two
too ashamed to work here.

471
00:38:00.904 --> 00:38:02.322 line:80%
I won't stand for it.

472
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.203 line:80%
That's too bad.

473
00:38:09.788 --> 00:38:13.083 line:80%
Your husband was fired.

474
00:38:17.212 --> 00:38:21.466 line:80%
So stop suspecting me,
and go be a good wife. Oh, wait.

475
00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:23.260 line:80%
You two are divorcing.

476
00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:26.680 line:80%
That's too bad.

477
00:38:29.182 --> 00:38:30.225 line:80%
But...

478
00:38:31.101 --> 00:38:33.228 line:80%
thinking about it is pissing me off.

479
00:38:34.938 --> 00:38:37.649 line:80%
Only you would covet trash like Min-hwan.

480
00:38:38.275 --> 00:38:39.651 line:80%
Why would I?

481
00:38:43.196 --> 00:38:45.365 line:80%
Unless I was a fool.

482
00:38:55.292 --> 00:38:58.336 line:80%
Let go. I'm going. Let me go!

483
00:39:05.469 --> 00:39:09.848 line:80%
Min-hwan, Jeong Su-min just came
and caused a fuss. It scared me.

484
00:39:12.476 --> 00:39:16.688 line:80%
But rumors won't spread here
since everyone thinks Su-min's crazy.

485
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:21.860 line:80%
Oh, no. I sent it
to the wrong person. Sorry.

486
00:39:22.444 --> 00:39:25.030 line:80%
Is she out of her mind?

487
00:39:28.784 --> 00:39:30.160 line:80%
I won't stand for this.

488
00:39:37.042 --> 00:39:39.211 line:80%
Jeong Su-min will call me soon.

489
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:50.889 line:80%
JEONG SU-MIN

490
00:39:50.972 --> 00:39:53.475 line:80%
I'm going to ruin Kang Ji-won.

491
00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:55.018 line:80%
Have her.

492
00:39:55.102 --> 00:39:59.022 line:80%
In return,
she has to hit rock bottom first.

493
00:39:59.898 --> 00:40:01.566 line:80%
I'll make her beg.

494
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.443 line:80%
I won't cooperate before that.

495
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:13.453 line:80%
We have Su-min in our hands.

496
00:40:13.537 --> 00:40:15.288 line:80%
I'll try to move Min-hwan.

497
00:40:17.541 --> 00:40:19.459 line:80%
I think he's gotten it by now.

498
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:26.341 line:80%
HAEYEONG VILLA

499
00:40:28.552 --> 00:40:30.011 line:80%
What would U&K send me?

500
00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:36.351 line:80%
U&K LIFE
INSURANCE POLICY

501
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:38.145 line:80%
What the heck?

502
00:40:38.228 --> 00:40:41.106 line:80%
I was fired.
I have no money to pay for this.

503
00:40:55.662 --> 00:40:59.666 line:80%
SPOUSE'S DEATH AFTER INJURY
500 MILLION WON

504
00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:36.995 line:80%
You may not have a reason to cover for me,

505
00:41:37.954 --> 00:41:39.372 line:80%
but we can make a deal.

506
00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:43.960 line:80%
I'll take care of Su-min
so she won't bother you.

507
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:48.465 line:80%
Tell them to bring one more meal.

508
00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:51.134 line:80%
Let's eat first.

509
00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:07.317 line:80%
So how will you take care of your wife?

510
00:42:11.613 --> 00:42:13.949 line:80%
I'm broke, so I was going to kill myself.

511
00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:16.243 line:80%
But there's a way to live.

512
00:42:17.077 --> 00:42:19.871 line:80%
And I think that might help you too.

513
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.836 line:80%
SPOUSE'S DEATH AFTER INJURY
500 MILLION WON

514
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.339 line:80%
You can only get this after death.

515
00:42:29.422 --> 00:42:31.508 line:80%
If Su-min disappears,

516
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.552 line:80%
there won't be anyone to threaten you.

517
00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:40.392 line:80%
It won't be easy.
We have to get our story straight.

518
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:43.436 line:80%
But can't you help me?

519
00:42:44.312 --> 00:42:47.232 line:80%
You want me to clean up your mess? Again?

520
00:42:48.316 --> 00:42:49.818 line:80%
Not just that.

521
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.987 line:80%
Set it up for me too.

522
00:42:53.196 --> 00:42:57.158 line:80%
Money and connections are everything,
but I don't have any of them.

523
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:01.496 line:80%
You've got guts.

524
00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:07.085 line:80%
If you don't have anything,
you should at least have guts.

525
00:43:07.961 --> 00:43:11.172 line:80%
But isn't that all you have?

526
00:43:13.466 --> 00:43:15.427 line:80%
You think it was easy to decide?

527
00:43:16.636 --> 00:43:18.555 line:80%
This is my last resort.

528
00:43:19.347 --> 00:43:20.473 line:80%
I'll risk my life.

529
00:43:24.144 --> 00:43:25.645 line:80%
This is your last chance.

530
00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:42.454 line:80%
Park Min-hwan is at Oh Yu-ra's suite
right now.

531
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:48.376 line:80%
So it's today.

532
00:43:54.424 --> 00:43:56.509 line:80%
JEONG SU-MIN

533
00:44:02.474 --> 00:44:06.728 line:80%
Park Min-hwan and Kang Ji-won are
in room 1355 at Winton Hotel.

534
00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:54.150 line:80%
Room 1355.

535
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.234 line:80%
Room 1355.

536
00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:53.334 line:80%
Move.

537
00:46:18.026 --> 00:46:21.029 line:80%
But I think you're really smart, babe.

538
00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:24.991 line:80%
But that is pretty genius.

539
00:46:25.074 --> 00:46:28.077 line:80%
Going after
your wife's life insurance benefit?

540
00:46:28.161 --> 00:46:30.371 line:80%
How did you think of cancer insurance?

541
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:36.085 line:80%
Once I get paid,
I'll treat you to something nice.

542
00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:43.134 line:80%
Don't worry.

543
00:46:43.718 --> 00:46:46.262 line:80%
I know how to return the favor properly.

544
00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:52.602 line:80%
Oh, my God!

545
00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:04.822 line:80%
Damn...

546
00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:10.203 line:80%
Whoever it is, this is ridiculous.

547
00:47:11.496 --> 00:47:12.497 line:80%
Hey, Min-hwan.

548
00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:18.169 line:80%
You're a piece of trash
that can't be handled.

549
00:47:21.923 --> 00:47:23.925 line:80%
What are you going to do about it?

550
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.053 line:80%
Right?

551
00:47:28.888 --> 00:47:32.183 line:80%
I'm going to send the voice recording
to the police.

552
00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:35.270 line:80%
Where's my dad? Did you kill him?

553
00:47:38.731 --> 00:47:39.774 line:80%
Kill him?

554
00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:42.694 line:80%
I thought you were trying
to get Ji-won back.

555
00:47:42.777 --> 00:47:44.737 line:80%
What are you doing here with her?

556
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.656 line:80%
I heard you were fired.

557
00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:50.034 line:80%
Since you have a lot of free time,
spend it in jail.

558
00:47:51.661 --> 00:47:53.329 line:80%
Are you insane?

559
00:47:58.042 --> 00:48:00.003 line:80%
Get lost!

560
00:48:00.795 --> 00:48:03.131 line:80%
Let go of me!

561
00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:04.215 line:80%
Let go!

562
00:48:05.008 --> 00:48:06.175 line:80%
Damn it...

563
00:48:08.344 --> 00:48:09.679 line:80%
What do I do now?

564
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:12.223 line:80%
What do you mean?

565
00:48:12.307 --> 00:48:14.350 line:80%
We'll go forward with your plan.

566
00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:16.644 line:80%
But not here.

567
00:48:17.645 --> 00:48:19.022 line:80%
I'll set it up for you.

568
00:48:21.274 --> 00:48:22.275 line:80%
Ms. Oh.

569
00:48:35.204 --> 00:48:37.373 line:80%
If Park Min-hwan kills Jeong Su-min,

570
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:42.503 line:80%
set it up as murder
for the insurance claim

571
00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:45.548 line:80%
and distribute it to the media.

572
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:50.553 line:80%
I'll get it ready, but...

573
00:48:50.637 --> 00:48:54.849 line:80%
Make sure whatever he says about me
is nonsense.

574
00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:57.894 line:80%
Get rid of all the evidence, got it?

575
00:49:30.385 --> 00:49:32.303 line:80%
What do you think you're doing?

576
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:44.315 line:80%
So why did you do something like that?

577
00:49:45.108 --> 00:49:49.404 line:80%
You're great,
but you don't know your place.

578
00:49:53.282 --> 00:49:56.077 line:80%
I have money. I'll give it all to you.

579
00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:06.504 line:80%
If you kill me,

580
00:50:07.547 --> 00:50:09.716 line:80%
do you think she'll leave you alone?

581
00:50:19.142 --> 00:50:20.184 line:80%
Su-min.

582
00:50:22.103 --> 00:50:23.563 line:80%
I'll give it to you.

583
00:50:24.647 --> 00:50:27.275 line:80%
You really have hard evidence on Oh Yu-ra.

584
00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:31.446 line:80%
But too bad for you.

585
00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:35.783 line:80%
She erased it when you passed out.

586
00:50:37.326 --> 00:50:38.327 line:80%
What?

587
00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:41.414 line:80%
You dummy.

588
00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:46.127 line:80%
People like us shouldn't

589
00:50:47.003 --> 00:50:49.130 line:80%
go against people with power.

590
00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:52.091 line:80%
What can we do?

591
00:50:53.176 --> 00:50:54.260 line:80%
And...

592
00:50:56.304 --> 00:50:57.388 line:80%
you have no money.

593
00:50:57.472 --> 00:50:58.931 line:80%
0 WON

594
00:51:00.808 --> 00:51:02.977 line:80%
What's that?

595
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.021 line:80%
It wasn't your money anyway!

596
00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:07.774 line:80%
You stole it when you had the chance.

597
00:51:11.444 --> 00:51:12.278 line:80%
Oh, right.

598
00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:16.532 line:80%
You had the bag I bought for Ji-won.

599
00:51:18.534 --> 00:51:19.952 line:80%
I sold that.

600
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.372 line:80%
To take care of urgent matters for me.

601
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.419 line:80%
Don't be too upset.

602
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.134 line:80%
You said you wouldn't go down alone.

603
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.349 line:80%
One of us has to die.

604
00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:44.602 line:80%
So...

605
00:51:47.063 --> 00:51:50.024 line:80%
I have to take care of you to start over.

606
00:51:56.072 --> 00:51:57.073 line:80%
Just wait.

607
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.953 line:80%
Hey! Let me go!

608
00:52:02.036 --> 00:52:03.996 line:80%
Let me go!

609
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:07.208 line:80%
Let me go!

610
00:52:07.708 --> 00:52:09.377 line:80%
Let me go!

611
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.920 line:80%
Let me...

612
00:52:12.088 --> 00:52:13.673 line:80%
Let me go!

613
00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:14.841 line:80%
Hey!

614
00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:41.993 line:80%
The gas...

615
00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:55.214 line:80%
Where did she go?

616
00:53:05.808 --> 00:53:07.018 line:80%
Hey!

617
00:53:09.312 --> 00:53:11.272 line:80%
Are you crazy?

618
00:53:13.065 --> 00:53:14.734 line:80%
Leave the car key and move aside.

619
00:53:17.403 --> 00:53:19.322 line:80%
Okay. Just calm down.

620
00:53:20.656 --> 00:53:22.825 line:80%
Put the knife down! Calm down!

621
00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:25.286 line:80%
I won't die.

622
00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:26.829 line:80%
I'll never die!

623
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:32.501 line:80%
Here.

624
00:53:34.587 --> 00:53:35.588 line:80%
Here's the key.

625
00:53:37.965 --> 00:53:40.968 line:80%
Here it is. Put the knife down.

626
00:53:41.636 --> 00:53:43.137 line:80%
Just take it!

627
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.516 line:80%
Take it. Here.

628
00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:55.775 line:80%
You little...

629
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:00.821 line:80%
Come here.

630
00:54:01.822 --> 00:54:02.782 line:80%
Come here!

631
00:54:07.912 --> 00:54:09.288 line:80%
Damn it...

632
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:17.213 line:80%
My lovely wife's going to

633
00:54:17.797 --> 00:54:20.591 line:80%
die from carbon monoxide poisoning

634
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:24.762 line:80%
from a boiler malfunction
while I'm away to get groceries.

635
00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:29.308 line:80%
So stop ruining my life.

636
00:54:30.017 --> 00:54:32.019 line:80%
Just die already.

637
00:54:32.103 --> 00:54:34.563 line:80%
Hey! If you're going to die,
just die already.

638
00:54:40.236 --> 00:54:42.446 line:80%
This is what the insurance was about?

639
00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:45.658 line:80%
You think it'll go your way?

640
00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:50.246 line:80%
I think it will.

641
00:54:53.874 --> 00:54:54.875 line:80%
Damn it!

642
00:55:01.424 --> 00:55:04.218 line:80%
My husband shouldn't lose his manhood.

643
00:55:06.095 --> 00:55:07.263 line:80%
Damn it...

644
00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:11.142 line:80%
You little...

645
00:55:11.225 --> 00:55:12.226 line:80%
No.

646
00:55:13.019 --> 00:55:14.895 line:80%
Kang Ji-won told me

647
00:55:15.604 --> 00:55:17.356 line:80%
that you were sterile.

648
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.067 line:80%
What are you talking about?

649
00:55:20.735 --> 00:55:23.529 line:80%
You're shooting blanks!

650
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:25.948 line:80%
Want me to spell it out?

651
00:55:26.991 --> 00:55:28.993 line:80%
I didn't miscarry.

652
00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:31.162 line:80%
I was never pregnant.

653
00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:33.748 line:80%
Do you get it now?

654
00:55:38.586 --> 00:55:39.670 line:80%
I don't think so.

655
00:55:40.713 --> 00:55:42.840 line:80%
-You little...
-Let go, you bastard!

656
00:55:42.923 --> 00:55:44.508 line:80%
-Come here!
-Let go!

657
00:55:44.592 --> 00:55:45.634 line:80%
Let go of me!

658
00:55:50.765 --> 00:55:52.099 line:80%
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

659
00:57:11.095 --> 00:57:13.848 line:80%
I think Ms. Yang's divorce suit
will get easier.

660
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:19.270 line:80%
The evidence of the affair on the SD card,
I don't know why, but it's been restored.

661
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:22.106 line:80%
-Suddenly?
-
Yes
.

662
00:57:22.606 --> 00:57:25.651 line:80%
The video didn't work for no reason.

663
00:57:25.734 --> 00:57:27.987 line:80%
It suddenly worked for no reason too.

664
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:32.658 line:80%
I guess they're
just meant to get a divorce.

665
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:53.053 line:80%
THE LATE PARK MIN-HWAN'S FUNERAL
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER FUNERAL HALL

666
00:58:17.578 --> 00:58:19.538 line:80%
I checked the police report.

667
00:58:20.122 --> 00:58:23.792 line:80%
He fell over a glass table
and died after hitting his head.

668
00:58:26.253 --> 00:58:31.258 line:80%
With the evidence, the police are looking
for Jeong Su-min as the prime suspect.

669
00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:34.762 line:80%
But the security cameras didn't work,

670
00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:37.306 line:80%
so they must find out what happened.

671
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:46.523 line:80%
Are you going...

672
00:58:48.817 --> 00:58:50.194 line:80%
to the funeral?

673
00:59:06.252 --> 00:59:09.964 line:80%
I thought about how nice it would be
if you died.

674
00:59:10.047 --> 00:59:12.091 line:80%
I thought I'd burst of anger then.

675
00:59:14.593 --> 00:59:17.596 line:80%
Back when those disappointing times

676
00:59:18.764 --> 00:59:21.183 line:80%
were confirmed with despair and betrayal.

677
00:59:23.018 --> 00:59:24.520 line:80%
You look so beautiful today.

678
00:59:24.603 --> 00:59:26.230 line:80%
This little...

679
00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:27.690 line:80%
Get lost!

680
00:59:27.773 --> 00:59:28.774 line:80%
Just die.

681
00:59:32.653 --> 00:59:37.574 line:80%
I spent all night
wondering why you were like that to me.

682
00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:40.411 line:80%
But it ended like this.

683
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.101 line:80%
How dare you come here?

684
01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:12.860 line:80%
If you didn't betray Min-hwan,

685
01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:17.781 line:80%
he never would've married Su-min.

686
01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.827 line:80%
She killed my son.

687
01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.706 line:80%
That wench.

688
01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:29.793 line:80%
How could this...

689
01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:36.467 line:80%
She ruined my precious son's life!

690
01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:39.345 line:80%
My poor boy!

691
01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:55.569 line:80%
At a pension in Gyeonggi Province
on the 24th,

692
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.447 line:80%
Park, a man in his thirties,
was found dead.

693
01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:02.076 line:80%
The police confirmed his wife,
Jeong, is the prime suspect.

694
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:05.162 line:80%
Isn't this Jeong Su-min from marketing?

695
01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.705 line:80%
Don't you remember?

696
01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:08.749 line:80%
No, they just look alike.

697
01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.127 line:80%
Are you saying Min-hwan's dead?

698
01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:13.962 line:80%
What? Keep it down.

699
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.090 line:80%
I hear it's him.

700
01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:17.049 line:80%
Hey...

701
01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:24.723 line:80%
What's this?

702
01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:33.357 line:80%
Park Min-hwan's parents reported a theft.
A thief came in while they were away.

703
01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:35.859 line:80%
It was Jeong Su-min.

704
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.333 line:80%
That means she's in Seoul.

705
01:01:53.419 --> 01:01:56.672 line:80%
It's been a day
since the police put out an APB

706
01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.924 line:80%
on Jeong Su-min, the prime suspect,

707
01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:02.052 line:80%
but her exact whereabouts
are still unknown.

708
01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.430 line:80%
-
The police
-It's fine.

709
01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:07.141 line:80%
assume she's off the grid and on the run

710
01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:11.437 line:80%
and ask for the citizens'
active cooperation for the case.

711
01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:18.610 line:80%
The suspect is 160 cm tall
with a lean physique

712
01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:22.698 line:80%
and under suspicion of killing
her husband at a pension.

713
01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.373 line:80%
But I feel uneasy.

714
01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:36.044 line:80%
You're too nice, so you wouldn't know.

715
01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.802 line:80%
Some people don't know when to stop.

716
01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:49.641 line:80%
Unless you stomp on them completely,

717
01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:53.145 line:80%
they don't stop.

718
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.406 line:80%
You can't be the only one
who's happy, Ji-won.

719
01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:08.952 line:80%
Never.

720
01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:44.279 line:80%
What did I do?

721
01:03:44.363 --> 01:03:46.073 line:80%
-Do you have proof?
-Pay for what you did.

722
01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:49.117 line:80%
I will stay strong.

723
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:52.162 line:80%
I'll try a little harder too.

724
01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:55.123 line:80%
She bought thinner.
That means she'll set a fire.

725
01:03:55.207 --> 01:03:57.459 line:80%
What's the use of
stopping her from coming?

726
01:03:57.543 --> 01:04:00.921 line:80%
We did what you wanted.
Let me do what I want this time.

727
01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:04.258 line:80%
We can't do anything about it now.

728
01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.176 line:80%
You always think only about yourself.

729
01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.304 line:80%
I learned so many things because of you.

730
01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:11.139 line:80%
I'm going to kill you!

731
01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:13.850 line:80%
This is the price for your sins
and hell I made for you.

732
01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:14.893 line:80%
Take it.

733
01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:22.317 line:80%
