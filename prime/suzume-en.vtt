Mommy?

Mommy, where are you?

4
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.583 line:83%
Mom?

Suzume, are you up yet?

6
00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:33.875 line:83%
Yes.

There's a high-pressure system

-Looks delicious!

-Okay.

Oh, and Suzume...

11

I'm going to be late tonight,
so figure out dinner on your own.

Beautiful...

17

Hey...

18
00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:55.958 line:83%
you.

19
00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:03.833 line:83%
Do you know of any ruins in this area?

20
00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:05.375 line:83%
Ruins...?

21
00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:07.083 line:83%
I'm looking for a door.

22
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.083 line:83%
Well, there's a little abandoned town
over by that mountain...

23
00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:16.416 line:83%
I see. Thank you.

24
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:20.791 line:83%
Huh?

25
00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:25.583 line:83%
Did you watch yesterday's livestream?

26
00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:27.791 line:83%
It was amazing!

27
00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:28.958 line:83%
Suzume!

28
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:31.166 line:83%
-Good morning.
-Mornin', Aya.

29
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.041 line:83%
Why's your face all red?

30
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.666 line:83%
-It is? Seriously?
-Yeah.

31
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.708 line:83%
What's up?

32
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.166 line:83%
-I forgot something!
-What? You're gonna be late...

33
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:52.958 line:83%
Why...

34
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:55.666 line:83%
did I...?

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:16.666 line:83%
This is it, right?

38
00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:20.166 line:83%
I can't think of any other "ruins."

39
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.666 line:83%
Excuse me?

40
00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:35.916 line:83%
Hello?

41
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.833 line:83%
Mister?

42
00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:46.666 line:83%
I feel like...

43
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.375 line:83%
we've met somewhere before.

44
00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:55.041 line:83%
Am I totally stalking him right now?

45
00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:57.166 line:83%
I should go back.

46
00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.125 line:83%
He said something about a door.

47
00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:39.333 line:83%
Huh?

48
00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:48.875 line:83%
What is this?

49
00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:53.083 line:83%
What?

50
00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:00.125 line:83%
Why...?

51
00:07:03.125 --> 00:07:04.125 line:83%
Huh?

52
00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:18.375 line:83%
What?

53
00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:38.041 line:83%
It's cold.

54
00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:51.458 line:83%
What the heck is going on?

55
00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:52.916 line:83%
Creepy!

56
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:03.666 line:83%
There you are.

To what do we owe the pleasure?

58
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.125 line:83%
Lunch from your aunt?

59
00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.958 line:83%
I can taste the love from here.

60
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:13.083 line:83%
Right...

61
00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.416 line:83%
Hey, you know those ruins by Kaminoura?

62
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.708 line:83%
The old bathhouse district.

63
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:20.375 line:83%
Really?

64
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.708 line:83%
I remember it's in the mountains, right?

65
00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:25.958 line:83%
-What about it?
-There's this door...

66
00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:29.458 line:83%
-Never mind.
-For real?

67
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:31.458 line:83%
-Gonna leave us hanging?
-Spill the beans!

68
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.291 line:83%
Hey, is that a fire?

69
00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:38.541 line:83%
-Where?
-Over by the mountains.

70
00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:41.291 line:83%
-Huh? Where?
-Look at the smoke!

71
00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:43.125 line:83%
What are you talking about?

72
00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:45.541 line:83%
-Do you see anything, Aya?
-Nope.

73
00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.416 line:83%
-But...
-Is it from the fields?

74
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.791 line:83%
It's right there.

75
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.125 line:83%
W-What?

76
00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:56.208 line:83%
-An earthquake?
-Intensity 4.0!

77
00:08:56.291 --> 00:08:57.458 line:83%
Do you feel it?

78
00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:02.375 line:83%
Yeah, it is...

79
00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.208 line:83%
Oh, it's shaking.

80
00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.208 line:83%
-Hey, an earthquake.
-Really?

81
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.583 line:83%
I'm wide open!

82
00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:08.708 line:83%
Let's go!

83
00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:13.166 line:83%
-What was that?
-Think we're okay.

84
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.458 line:83%
-Is it over?
-That was nothing.

85
00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.083 line:83%
That was a little scary...

86
00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:21.000 line:83%
The warning was a bit much.

87
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:22.083 line:83%
Hey...

88
00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:24.500 line:83%
Look...

89
00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:26.333 line:83%
over there.

90
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.625 line:83%
What are you talking about?

91
00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:40.208 line:83%
Suzume, are you okay?

92
00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:42.208 line:83%
They can't see it...?

93
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.708 line:83%
Hey, Suzume!

94
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:53.875 line:83%
Daddy!

95
00:09:54.916 --> 00:09:56.375 line:83%
Why can't anyone...?

96
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.000 line:83%
What is that thing?

97
00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:07.916 line:83%
Don't tell me...

98
00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:10.291 line:83%
It can't be!

99
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.583 line:83%
There's no way!

100
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.500 line:83%
It's that door!

101
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.041 line:83%
It's him!

102
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.041 line:83%
What are you doing? Get out of here!

103
00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:54.291 line:83%
Are you all right?

104
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:00.375 line:83%
What now?

105
00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:01.583 line:83%
This is...

106
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:03.125 line:83%
...not good.

107
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.375 line:83%
-Earthquake warning...
-Dammit!

108
00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.208 line:83%
Watch out!

109
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:45.375 line:83%
Get away from here!

110
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.375 line:83%
Dammit...

111
00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:02.458 line:83%
Earthquake warning...

112
00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:19.375 line:83%
-Why are--?
-You need to close this, right?

113
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.625 line:83%
O Divine Gods
who dwell beneath this land...

114
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.375 line:83%
You have long protected us
for generations...

115
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:35.000 line:83%
Your mountains and rivers...

116
00:12:35.083 --> 00:12:36.791 line:83%
-that we have long called our own...
-Dad! C'mon, hurry!

117
00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:38.875 line:83%
-Over here!
-What's...?

118
00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.458 line:83%
Haven't been to a bathhouse in a while.

119
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:43.000 line:83%
Mom, let's take a bath again!

120
00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:46.083 line:83%
Honey, are you having another drink?

121
00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:49.458 line:83%
Let's come again next year.
On a family trip!

122
00:12:51.833 --> 00:12:54.125 line:83%
-It's closed!
-I return them to you!

123
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000 line:83%
What was that?

124
00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:27.708 line:83%
The Keystone was supposed
to keep this place sealed.

125
00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:30.416 line:83%
Why did you come here?

126
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.083 line:83%
How can you see the worm?

127
00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:34.083 line:83%
Where is the Keystone?

128
00:13:34.166 --> 00:13:36.708 line:83%
Worm? Stone...?

129
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:38.083 line:83%
What are you talking about?

130
00:13:42.666 --> 00:13:44.833 line:83%
This place became a Gate.

131
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:48.333 line:83%
The worm comes through the Gate.

132
00:13:49.416 --> 00:13:51.708 line:83%
Thank you for helping me.

133
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:55.083 line:83%
Now, forget everything
you saw here and go home.

134
00:13:56.583 --> 00:13:57.875 line:83%
But...

135
00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.500 line:83%
Wait! Your arm!

That was a pretty big earthquake.

138
00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:08.333 line:83%
Look at these shingles...

139
00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:10.416 line:83%
I think we got off pretty light.

140
00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:21.166 line:83%
Please go upstairs.
I'll get the first aid kit.

141
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.375 line:83%
That's really not--

142
00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:25.458 line:83%
If you won't go to the hospital,
at least let me bandage it.

143
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.458 line:83%
Is he some kinda man-baby?

HOW TO BECOME A NURSE

145
00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:55.083 line:83%
A child's chair.

146
00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:12.333 line:83%
Around 1:20 p.m. this afternoon

147
00:15:12.583 --> 00:15:14.583 line:83%
there was an earthquake in Miyazaki

148
00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:18.125 line:83%
with a recorded magnitude of 6.3.

149
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:20.958 line:83%
There is no risk of
a tsunami at this time.

150
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:25.708 line:83%
We do not have any information
regarding injuries--

151
00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:29.291 line:83%
You know your stuff.

152
00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:31.458 line:83%
My mom was a nurse.

153
00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:34.208 line:83%
But first... I have a ton of questions.

154
00:15:34.291 --> 00:15:35.708 line:83%
Figures.

155
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.250 line:83%
You said "worm." What did you mean?

156
00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:43.291 line:83%
The worm is a giant force that dwells
beneath the Japanese islands.

157
00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.791 line:83%
It has no rhyme or reason.

158
00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:47.625 line:83%
Yet, it rages and shakes the land
if disturbed.

159
00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:50.166 line:83%
But you just beat it, right?

160
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.291 line:83%
I only shut it away temporarily.

161
00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:56.291 line:83%
If we don't seal it with the Keystone,
it'll appear again.

162
00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.291 line:83%
You mean there'll be another earthquake?

163
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:02.083 line:83%
It's my job to stop that from happening.

164
00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:03.458 line:83%
Your job...

165
00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:07.416 line:83%
Hey, who exactly are yo--

166
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.708 line:83%
Thanks for patching me up.

167
00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:16.125 line:83%
-My name's Souta Munakata.
-I-I'm Suzume Iwato.

168
00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:20.083 line:83%
A cat...?

169
00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:22.833 line:83%
Oh my gosh, this kitten's a toothpick.

170
00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:25.125 line:83%
One sec.

171
00:16:34.916 --> 00:16:37.166 line:83%
You must've been starving.

172
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.208 line:83%
That earthquake was scary, huh?

173
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.541 line:83%
So cute.

174
00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:45.416 line:83%
-Want to become my cat?
-Yeah.

175
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:51.291 line:83%
Suzume... is kind. I like you.

176
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.791 line:83%
You... are in the way.

177
00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:03.541 line:83%
W-W-Whaaa--?

178
00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.500 line:83%
Souta? Where are you?

179
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.166 line:83%
What the... hell?

180
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.666 line:83%
Whaaaaa--?

181
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.958 line:83%
-S-Souta?
-Suzume...

182
00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:23.791 line:83%
What's happening?

183
00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:28.666 line:83%
Is this your doing? Come back here!

184
00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:31.083 line:83%
Dammit...!

185
00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:41.333 line:83%
What the--?

186
00:17:41.708 --> 00:17:43.083 line:83%
This can't be happening!

187
00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:48.291 line:83%
No no no no!

188
00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:50.083 line:83%
-Oh, Suzume.
-Tamaki!

189
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:51.541 line:83%
Sorry, stepping out!

190
00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:53.083 line:83%
Where are you going?

191
00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.916 line:83%
I came home early, worried about you.

192
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000 line:83%
The earthquake?

193
00:17:57.083 --> 00:18:00.000 line:83%
-You didn't pick up your phone.
-Sorry! Missed it.

194
00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:02.083 line:83%
-But, I'm okay.
-H-Hey...

195
00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:04.458 line:83%
Suzume! Answer me!

196
00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:08.958 line:83%
Hey, a kitty!

197
00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:21.125 line:83%
What is that?

198
00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:22.416 line:83%
Excuse me!

199
00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:26.708 line:83%
What is even happening right now?

200
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:38.333 line:83%
Hey, Suzume!

201
00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:40.541 line:83%
Hey!

202
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:43.208 line:83%
Where... are you going?

203
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.041 line:83%
What the--?

204
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:51.500 line:83%
Ack!

205
00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:54.833 line:83%
I'm so, so sorry!

206
00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:59.125 line:83%
Thank you very much for your patience.

207
00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:02.083 line:83%
We have been given clearance to depart.

208
00:19:02.166 --> 00:19:04.500 line:83%
We are now disembarking from the dock.

209
00:19:07.083 --> 00:19:08.083 line:83%
Hey, did you see that?

210
00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:09.583 line:83%
-Yeah, I did.
-What the heck was that?

211
00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:11.208 line:83%
-A toy?
-You see that chair?

212
00:19:11.291 --> 00:19:12.375 line:83%
Very impressive.

213
00:19:12.833 --> 00:19:14.625 line:83%
Where... did you go?

214
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.625 line:83%
My gosh...!

215
00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:24.375 line:83%
Why do you run?

216
00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.291 line:83%
What did you do to me?

217
00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:28.125 line:83%
What are you?

218
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:29.666 line:83%
Answer me!

219
00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:36.041 line:83%
Oh no!

220
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.208 line:83%
Suzume!

221
00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:39.708 line:83%
See you.

222
00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:45.958 line:83%
Whaaaaat?

223
00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:56.458 line:83%
Like I said...
I'm spending the night at Aya's.

224
00:19:57.791 --> 00:19:59.833 line:83%
I'm sorry. I'll be home tomorrow.

225
00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:01.958 line:83%
Now wait just one moment, Suzume.

226
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:04.708 line:83%
You can stay over,

227
00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:07.166 line:83%
but why is the first aid kit in your room?

228
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.208 line:83%
Did you have someone over?

229
00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.750 line:83%
I don't even want
to think about it, but...

230
00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:14.625 line:83%
Are you seeing some good-for-noth--!

231
00:20:14.708 --> 00:20:16.833 line:83%
No! No boys! I'm hanging up!

232
00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:26.708 line:83%
-Did you see that runnin' chair, missy?
-No.

233
00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:37.916 line:83%
Souta.

234
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.208 line:83%
This ship will reach Ehime by morning.

235
00:20:40.791 --> 00:20:43.375 line:83%
Looks like the cat's ship
is heading there too.

236
00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:44.541 line:83%
I see.

237
00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:46.708 line:83%
I got some bread.

238
00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:47.833 line:83%
Thanks.

239
00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:50.250 line:83%
But I'm not hungry.

240
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.333 line:83%
Okay.

241
00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.875 line:83%
Um, why are you a chair?

242
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.291 line:83%
Apparently, that cat placed a curse on me.

243
00:21:03.375 --> 00:21:05.500 line:83%
A curse? Are you okay?

244
00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:07.708 line:83%
Does it hurt?

245
00:21:07.791 --> 00:21:09.291 line:83%
I'm fine.

246
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.916 line:83%
You're warm.

247
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.083 line:83%
Still, I have to figure this out.

248
00:21:15.541 --> 00:21:20.333 line:83%
Souta, there's something bothering me.

249
00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:24.458 line:83%
A relic in the ruins...?
That's the Keystone!

250
00:21:24.541 --> 00:21:27.916 line:83%
-You removed it?
-Removed...?

251
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.791 line:83%
Of course... That cat is the Keystone!

252
00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:32.916 line:83%
How dare it leave its post.

253
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.541 line:83%
What do you mean?

254
00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:38.125 line:83%
You set the Keystone free,
and now it's cursed me.

255
00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:39.375 line:83%
Oh no...

256
00:21:39.458 --> 00:21:41.166 line:83%
I'm so sorry, I...

257
00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:43.500 line:83%
What should I do?

258
00:21:46.166 --> 00:21:47.166 line:83%
No.

259
00:21:47.416 --> 00:21:50.750 line:83%
It's my fault for
not finding the door sooner.

260
00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:52.708 line:83%
-This isn't on you.
-But...

261
00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:55.416 line:83%
Suzume, I'm a Closer.

262
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.708 line:83%
A "Closer"?

263
00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:01.375 line:83%
I close the open doors
so that disaster won't spread.

264
00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:04.083 line:83%
I travel across Japan doing that.

265
00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:07.958 line:83%
It's our job as Closers.

266
00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:11.375 line:83%
You're hungry, right? Eat up.

267
00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:20.000 line:83%
We must turn the Keystone back
and banish the worm.

268
00:22:20.083 --> 00:22:23.708 line:83%
Surely then, I'll return to my body.

269
00:22:23.916 --> 00:22:26.958 line:83%
So, don't worry.

270
00:22:27.708 --> 00:22:30.625 line:83%
Tomorrow, you're going home.

271
00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:43.708 line:83%
Mommy?

272
00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.583 line:83%
Mommy!

273
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.583 line:83%
Mommy!

274
00:22:50.666 --> 00:22:52.250 line:83%
Where are you?

275
00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:15.583 line:83%
Souta?

276
00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:18.416 line:83%
Do you always sleep like that?

277
00:23:32.666 --> 00:23:34.125 line:83%
My heart's pounding.

278
00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:37.791 line:83%
Thank you very much for
riding the Shikoku Orange Ferry today.

279
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:39.625 line:83%
-Man it's hot.
-Finally!

280
00:23:39.708 --> 00:23:41.041 line:83%
-You're goin' to Osaka?
-It's been a while.

281
00:23:41.125 --> 00:23:43.291 line:83%
-Yeah, but I'll spend the night somewhere.
-
On behalf of

282
00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:46.541 line:83%
the entire crew, we hope to see you again.

283
00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:47.875 line:83%
Suzume?

284
00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:51.875 line:83%
Finally, you are up!

285
00:23:52.291 --> 00:23:54.291 line:83%
You wouldn't wake up,

286
00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:57.333 line:83%
I was beginning to think
this was all a dream.

287
00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:59.500 line:83%
I was asleep?

288
00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:01.250 line:83%
Never mind.

289
00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:03.583 line:83%
Now, how do we find that cat?

290
00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:05.750 line:83%
We should ask around the harbor first.

291
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:07.541 line:83%
But where are we?

292
00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:08.833 line:83%
Hey, you!

293
00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:11.625 line:83%
It looks like... the edge of Ehime?

294
00:24:11.708 --> 00:24:13.041 line:83%
Wow, we came a long way.

295
00:24:13.125 --> 00:24:16.708 line:83%
Get on the next ferry,
and you can make it home tonight.

296
00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:18.166 line:83%
-You should--
-Oh no!

297
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.250 line:83%
What is it?

298
00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:21.875 line:83%
OMG! I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN "WHISPER OF THE HEART"

299
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.625 line:83%
Hey, a white cat.

300
00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:25.125 line:83%
It's so cute!

301
00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:26.541 line:83%
A kitten?

302
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:28.541 line:83%
-What's your name?
-Who are you?

303
00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:29.791 line:83%
And you are?

304
00:24:29.875 --> 00:24:31.541 line:83%
-Perhaps "Daijin"?
-Daijin?

305
00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:33.375 line:83%
You do seem pretty fancy.

306
00:24:38.666 --> 00:24:40.333 line:83%
#WITHDAIJIN
IT'S SO ADORABLE... SITTING NEXT TO ME.

307
00:24:40.416 --> 00:24:42.666 line:83%
POSTED - TWEETED - POST UPLOADED

308
00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:44.750 line:83%
This is so him, isn't it?

309
00:24:44.833 --> 00:24:45.833 line:83%
How could this be...

310
00:24:45.916 --> 00:24:47.583 line:83%
LOOK WHO I MET GETTING OFF THE TRAIN

311
00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:48.833 line:83%
CONDUCTING!

312
00:24:48.916 --> 00:24:51.083 line:83%
SNACK TIME - INSTAGRAM-ABLE
LOOKING SLY...!!

313
00:24:51.166 --> 00:24:52.166 line:83%
"Daijin"?

314
00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:55.250 line:83%
I mean he does kind of...

315
00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:56.583 line:83%
He's moving by train.

316
00:24:56.666 --> 00:24:57.666 line:83%
I have to go after him.

317
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.916 line:83%
Thanks for everything, Suzume.

318
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.500 line:83%
This is goodbye.

319
00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:03.166 line:83%
Get home safely.

320
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.125 line:83%
Umm...

321
00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:11.666 line:83%
Your family's going to worry
if you don't go home.

322
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.916 line:83%
It's fine.
They let me make my own choices.

323
00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:18.583 line:83%
This could be very dangerous.

324
00:25:18.666 --> 00:25:20.583 line:83%
It's not safe for you to follow me.

325
00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:22.833 line:83%
I think you've got
bigger problems right now.

326
00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:23.916 line:83%
Look.

327
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.125 line:83%
I SAW IT TOO!

328
00:25:25.208 --> 00:25:26.291 line:83%
MYSTERY GIRL AND MOVING CHAIR

329
00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:28.416 line:83%
NEW ROBOT FROM BOST*N DYNAMICS...?
SEND ME INFO!

330
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:29.791 line:83%
Oh no...

331
00:25:29.875 --> 00:25:32.416 line:83%
It's dangerous for you to walk in public.

Suzume...

335
00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:42.916 line:83%

336
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.416 line:83%
-I'll need your help.
-My pleasure.

Hey, this photo... I think it's near here.

359
00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:27.333 line:83%
What's the matter?

360
00:27:28.583 --> 00:27:29.583 line:83%
Suzume?

361
00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:39.625 line:83%
Sorry, I just remembered something.

362

Hey, whaddya mean? Suzume?

363

Can the worm show up anywhere?

364

The Gate in this area has opened.

365
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:52.083 line:83%
We need to close it fast.

366
00:27:52.166 --> 00:27:54.208 line:83%
We're not going to make it at this rate.

367

Few years back, there was a landslide.

There's nothin' past here.

375
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.541 line:83%
It's abandoned?

376
00:28:10.625 --> 00:28:12.500 line:83%
That's perfect. Keep going!

377
00:28:12.833 --> 00:28:14.166 line:83%
Will there be another quake?

378
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:18.000 line:83%
We must close the door
before the worm falls to the earth.

379
00:28:18.083 --> 00:28:19.541 line:83%
Or else...!

380
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.000 line:83%
DO NOT ENTER

Thanks so much, Chika!

383
00:28:27.375 --> 00:28:29.000 line:83%
Huh? S-Suzume...?

384
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:32.750 line:83%
Suzume, you've done enough.

385
00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:34.791 line:83%
Hey, wait--! Souta!

386
00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:35.916 line:83%
It's too dangerous.

387
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.291 line:83%
Go back with that girl.

388
00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:40.125 line:83%
You can't go with that body!

389
00:28:41.291 --> 00:28:42.666 line:83%

Dammit.

393
00:29:12.291 --> 00:29:14.416 line:83%
I can't even...!

394
00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:16.791 line:83%
No!

395
00:29:25.333 --> 00:29:26.458 line:83%
It's falling.

396
00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:35.750 line:83%
Souta!

397
00:29:36.166 --> 00:29:37.166 line:83%
Suzume?

398
00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:43.916 line:83%
-Are you not afraid to die?
-I'm not!

399
00:29:45.833 --> 00:29:46.875 line:83%
Suzume?

400
00:29:46.958 --> 00:29:48.250 line:83%
You lock the door.

401
00:29:48.833 --> 00:29:51.875 line:83%
Close your eyes
and think of the people who lived here.

402
00:29:51.958 --> 00:29:53.166 line:83%
The keyhole will appear.

403
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:55.000 line:83%
You're telling me this now?

404
00:29:55.083 --> 00:29:57.166 line:83%
Please! I can't do it!

405
00:29:58.083 --> 00:29:59.208 line:83%
Close your eyes!

406
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:03.000 line:83%
Now feel all the emotion
that should be here.

407
00:30:03.083 --> 00:30:04.625 line:83%
Listen to their voices.

408
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.166 line:83%
-Mornin'!
-G'morning.

409
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.083 line:83%

412
00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:17.458 line:83%
Come hang out after you graduate.

413
00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:19.916 line:83%
O Divine Gods
who dwell beneath this land...

414
00:30:20.541 --> 00:30:22.750 line:83%
You have long protected us
for generations...

415
00:30:22.833 --> 00:30:25.916 line:83%
Your mountains and rivers...

416
00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:29.625 line:83%
that we have long called our own...

417
00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:31.208 line:83%
Now!

418
00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:32.791 line:83%
I return them to you!

419
00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:57.666 line:83%
We did it, Suzume.

420
00:30:58.208 --> 00:31:00.833 line:83%
You just prevented an earthquake.

421
00:31:01.208 --> 00:31:02.541 line:83%
Really?

422
00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:04.125 line:83%
I can't believe it...

423
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.958 line:83%
I did it!

424
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:08.375 line:83%
We make a great team!

425
00:31:08.458 --> 00:31:10.166 line:83%
Suzume, you're amazing.

426
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.166 line:83%
Another Gate will open.

427
00:31:15.416 --> 00:31:17.583 line:83%
The Keystone. Wait!

428
00:31:21.916 --> 00:31:23.791 line:83%
Did he open the door?

429
00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:31.291 line:83%
You're in Ehime?

430
00:31:31.833 --> 00:31:34.791 line:83%
Suzume, you said

431
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.291 line:83%
you were staying at Aya's yesterday.

432
00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:40.958 line:83%
"A little vacation"...?

433
00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:43.416 line:83%
Not funny at all.

434
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.833 line:83%
I had better see you home tomorrow.

435
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:49.416 line:83%
-Where are you staying tonight?
-Minoru, we got a table.

436
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.416 line:83%
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

437
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.291 line:83%
I'll invite Tamaki.

438
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.625 line:83%
That's not what I'm talking about!

439
00:31:55.708 --> 00:31:57.041 line:83%
What about school?

440
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.291 line:83%
Suzume going through a rebellious phase?

441
00:32:00.541 --> 00:32:03.166 line:83%
Anyway!
Tell me where you're staying tonight.

442

Oh, Shige made a reservation...

446
00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:16.541 line:83%

Oh man...

476
00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:45.291 line:83%
She seriously needs a date.

477
00:33:45.375 --> 00:33:46.666 line:83%
Your aunt's single?

478
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:47.750 line:83%
How old is she?

479
00:33:47.833 --> 00:33:49.208 line:83%
About 40, I think?

480
00:33:50.166 --> 00:33:52.041 line:83%
She's really pretty, though.

She's my guardian.

483
00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:57.958 line:83%
-Sounds complicated.
-Not really.

484
00:33:58.541 --> 00:33:59.750 line:83%
But sometimes...

485
00:33:59.833 --> 00:34:03.333 line:83%
I feel like
I've stolen her most precious years.

486

Especially lately.

487
00:34:06.583 --> 00:34:08.208 line:83%
You sound like her ex-boyfriend.

00:34:08.416 --> 00:34:09.666 line:83%
Oh my gosh!

489
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:13.916 line:83%

-Not again!

498
00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:35.208 line:83%
Why don't you clean the bath next?

499
00:34:36.041 --> 00:34:38.625 line:83%
You're kidding! He didn't..!

500
00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:40.458 line:83%
Oh, totally. Not just that...

501
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:42.458 line:83%
Whaaa--? For real?

502
00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:45.125 line:83%
Right? Boys are dumb.

503
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:52.708 line:83%
I got to go there again today
thanks to you.

504
00:34:53.666 --> 00:34:56.958 line:83%
My middle school was over there.

505
00:34:57.416 --> 00:35:01.791 line:83%
After the landslide a few years ago
they abandoned the whole area.

506
00:35:02.583 --> 00:35:03.875 line:83%
Hey, Suzume.

507
00:35:04.125 --> 00:35:05.958 line:83%
What were you doin' there?

508
00:35:06.041 --> 00:35:07.458 line:83%
Covered in mud and all...

509
00:35:08.166 --> 00:35:10.041 line:83%
And what's with that chair?

510
00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:13.666 line:83%
Who exactly are ya?

511
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.541 line:83%
That chair... is a memento from my mom.

512
00:35:18.875 --> 00:35:20.208 line:83%
But now...

513
00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:23.458 line:83%
Sorry, it's hard to explain.

514
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.791 line:83%
Suzume, you're like a wizard.

515
00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:28.625 line:83%
Full o' secrets.

516
00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:31.458 line:83%
But why do I feel like...

517
00:35:31.541 --> 00:35:35.041 line:83%
you're doing somethin' really important?

518
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.458 line:83%
Thank you, Chika!

519
00:35:38.541 --> 00:35:42.375 line:83%
Yeah, I think I'm doing
something important, too!

520
00:35:43.458 --> 00:35:44.833 line:83%
Modest much?

521
00:36:04.083 --> 00:36:06.250 line:83%
Some people just refuse to wake up.

522
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.250 line:83%
Who? Your BF?

523
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:09.583 line:83%
I don't have one!

524
00:36:09.666 --> 00:36:10.958 line:83%
I mean in general.

525
00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:13.000 line:83%
If they won't wake up...

526
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.000 line:83%
-just give 'em a kiss.
-Wha--?

527
00:36:18.666 --> 00:36:22.083 line:83%
-I heard you're headin' home?
-Yes, I am!

528
00:36:22.166 --> 00:36:23.500 line:83%
Thank you so much for everything.

529
00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:26.125 line:83%
-You're welcome anytime, y'hear?
-Thank you!

530
00:36:26.208 --> 00:36:27.500 line:83%
Hey, check it out!

531
00:36:27.583 --> 00:36:29.083 line:83%
This guy's amazin'!

532
00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:32.166 line:83%
It is unknown where this kitty came from,

533
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.625 line:83%
but he's crossing the cables
of a suspension bridge.

534
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:37.000 line:83%
Uhhh...

535
00:36:37.083 --> 00:36:38.250 line:83%
Ain't that somethin'?

536
00:36:39.958 --> 00:36:42.083 line:83%
Hey, Souta!

537
00:36:43.041 --> 00:36:45.875 line:83%
Wake up already!

538
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.750 line:83%
Ugh.

539
00:36:58.541 --> 00:36:59.625 line:83%
Wait.

540
00:37:00.208 --> 00:37:01.750 line:83%
Where's your mouth?

541
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:04.041 line:83%
Suzume...?

542
00:37:05.666 --> 00:37:07.666 line:83%
Good morning. What is it?

543
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.125 line:83%
Don't "What is it" me!

544
00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:10.750 line:83%
-Look, it's Daijin.
-This kitty is creating...

545
00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:12.416 line:83%
-What's he trying to do?
-...
a lot of buzz...

546
00:37:12.916 --> 00:37:15.041 line:83%
Gods follow naught
but their own whims, so...

547
00:37:15.458 --> 00:37:18.250 line:83%
-Gods?
-That bridge leads to Kobe.

548
00:37:18.458 --> 00:37:19.541 line:83%
We should--!

549
00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:21.916 line:83%
Suzume. You're leavin' soon, right?

550
00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:25.916 line:83%
-Yeah, just getting dressed.
-Perfect.

551
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.541 line:83%
Use these, if ya want.

552
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.166 line:83%
Yup. Suits ya better than me.

553
00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:34.958 line:83%
Ya stuck out in your uniform
with that chair.

554
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.416 line:83%
Chika...

555
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.666 line:83%
How can I ever repay you?

556
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.375 line:83%
Don't worry nothin' 'bout it.

557
00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:44.125 line:83%
-Come visit sometime?
-Yeah. I promise.

558
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.250 line:83%
TO KOBE

559
00:38:00.333 --> 00:38:03.416 line:83%
Suzume... You need to be clearer
about what you want.

560
00:38:03.833 --> 00:38:05.833 line:83%
Like waving your arms or something.

561
00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:08.875 line:83%
You do it
and people will be shocked and stop.

562
00:38:08.958 --> 00:38:10.708 line:83%
Chairs shouldn't be moving.

563
00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:13.583 line:83%
Thank goodness. You do get it.

564
00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.166 line:83%
Can we go by bus?

565
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.166 line:83%
The next bus is six hours from now.

566
00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:31.666 line:83%
Suzume.

567
00:38:31.958 --> 00:38:35.208 line:83%
You said this chair
was a memento of your mother?

568
00:38:35.291 --> 00:38:36.708 line:83%
Yeah.

569
00:38:36.958 --> 00:38:39.333 line:83%
Why does it only have three legs?

570
00:38:40.083 --> 00:38:43.291 line:83%
I was so young, I don't really remember.

571
00:38:43.375 --> 00:38:45.416 line:83%
But, I lost this chair once.

572
00:38:46.916 --> 00:38:49.666 line:83%
When I found it, a leg was missing.

573
00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:05.916 line:83%
Where you headed?

574
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.416 line:83%
Won't be any buses for a while.

575
00:39:09.583 --> 00:39:12.666 line:83%
Sounds fun. A little soul searching?

576
00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:14.666 line:83%
Going to downtown Kobe?

577
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.208 line:83%
-That would be amazing.
-Got it.

578
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:22.291 line:83%
We were visiting their grandma's
and were on our way back to Kobe.

579
00:39:22.375 --> 00:39:23.791 line:83%
You really lucked out.

580
00:39:25.125 --> 00:39:28.583 line:83%
-Mom, look at this!
-What is it?

581
00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:31.708 line:83%
-Stop touching her stuff!
-Okaaaay.

582
00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:34.166 line:83%
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

583
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:39.875 line:83%
Why are they staring at your stuff...?

584
00:39:39.958 --> 00:39:42.875 line:83%
It's just a chair.

585
00:39:42.958 --> 00:39:44.583 line:83%
I see.

586
00:39:45.083 --> 00:39:46.416 line:83%
Still staring...

587
00:39:52.625 --> 00:39:54.416 line:83%
EHIME - TOKUSHIMA

588
00:40:01.125 --> 00:40:04.666 line:83%
KOBE

589
00:40:17.583 --> 00:40:19.666 line:83%
Careful! Don't spill anything.

590
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.583 line:83%
Keep her chair nice and clean.

591
00:40:21.666 --> 00:40:22.916 line:83%
-I know!
-You bet'cha!

592
00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:41.416 line:83%
Didn't know you could see it from here...

593
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.708 line:83%
The amusement park.

594
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:44.833 line:83%
An amusement park?

595
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.500 line:83%
Over there, on the mountain.

596
00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:50.000 line:83%
My folks would take me there
when I was little.

597
00:40:50.666 --> 00:40:52.625 line:83%
But things went downhill.

598
00:40:52.708 --> 00:40:56.250 line:83%
Now, they don't even
have the money to tear it down.

599
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000 line:83%
There's lots of lonely places
like that these days.

600
00:41:03.041 --> 00:41:05.250 line:83%
I don't believe it...

601
00:41:06.125 --> 00:41:10.500 line:83%
The kids' daycare just texted
saying they had to close today.

602
00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:12.083 line:83%
Hey, knock it off!

603
00:41:12.916 --> 00:41:16.166 line:83%
Ugh, I have to open the shop soon.

604
00:41:16.375 --> 00:41:17.833 line:83%
Gotta find someone...

605
00:41:18.291 --> 00:41:19.666 line:83%
-Oh!
-Hm?

606
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:20.750 line:83%
Huuuuuh?

607
00:41:20.833 --> 00:41:21.916 line:83%
KYUNOMIYA SUJI STRIP MALL

608
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.708 line:83%
Um... What do you want to play?

609
00:41:25.791 --> 00:41:27.000 line:83%
House! Let's make curry!

610
00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:29.000 line:83%
Ready... Go!

611
00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:31.083 line:83%
Whaaa--?

612
00:41:31.875 --> 00:41:33.000 line:83%
Don't eat those!

613
00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:35.000 line:83%
Whoever empties it first wins.

614
00:41:35.083 --> 00:41:36.750 line:83%
Ready? Go!

615
00:41:36.833 --> 00:41:38.583 line:83%
Stop that!

616
00:41:40.458 --> 00:41:42.000 line:83%
You're Mt. Fuji, 'kay?

617
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.791 line:83%
Ready? Go!

618
00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:50.833 line:83%
I don't think...

619
00:41:51.541 --> 00:41:53.500 line:83%
...I'm cut out for kids.

620
00:41:54.166 --> 00:41:55.625 line:83%
You need help...

621
00:41:59.666 --> 00:42:01.791 line:83%
What the--?

622
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.375 line:83%
Heeeeey! Isn't it amazing?

623
00:42:05.458 --> 00:42:07.666 line:83%
What a super cool toy.

624
00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:14.750 line:83%
BAR HARBOR

625
00:42:14.833 --> 00:42:16.833 line:83%
Me too! Me too!

626
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:21.833 line:83%
My turn next!

627
00:42:21.916 --> 00:42:23.375 line:83%
Not you.

628
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:24.666 line:83%
It talked!

629
00:42:25.291 --> 00:42:26.500 line:83%
P-Pretty cool, huh?

630
00:42:26.583 --> 00:42:29.500 line:83%
It's a chair-shaped robot...
with built-in AI?

631
00:42:29.583 --> 00:42:32.583 line:83%
-What's its name?
-Souta.

632
00:42:32.666 --> 00:42:34.916 line:83%
-Souta, what's tomorrow's weather?
-Souta, play music!

633
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.291 line:83%
-Souta, a word game!
-Souta, are the stocks up today?

634
00:42:37.375 --> 00:42:40.083 line:83%
-Souta's not that smart, so...
-What was that, Suzume?

635
00:42:40.166 --> 00:42:41.958 line:83%
It spoke again!

636
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.916 line:83%
Running away from home?

637
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.333 line:83%
I mean, I did it when I was a kid too.

638
00:42:51.583 --> 00:42:53.291 line:83%
When you're at that age,

639
00:42:53.375 --> 00:42:57.166 line:83%
the town, your parents...
it's suffocating.

640
00:42:57.791 --> 00:43:00.416 line:83%
-So--
-We're not talking about you.

641
00:43:01.833 --> 00:43:02.916 line:83%
Right.

642
00:43:04.416 --> 00:43:06.833 line:83%
Where is she going?

643
00:43:06.916 --> 00:43:08.291 line:83%
What did I do wrong?

644
00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:10.583 line:83%
She keeps putting me off.

645
00:43:10.666 --> 00:43:12.666 line:83%
Won't even tell me
where she's staying tonight.

646
00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:15.708 line:83%
What about her phone's GPS?

647
00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:17.125 line:83%
I don't have access.

648
00:43:17.208 --> 00:43:19.708 line:83%
What about her bank account?

649
00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:22.083 line:83%
Is it linked to her phone?

650
00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:27.416 line:83%
Where is she?

651
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.416 line:83%
-She's in Kobe...
-Kobe?

652
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:33.666 line:83%
That's a long way from home.

653
00:43:34.166 --> 00:43:35.916 line:83%
I can't let her be alone anymore...

654
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.541 line:83%
Um, Tamaki?

655
00:43:37.625 --> 00:43:39.500 line:83%
If there's anything else I can do--

656
00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:40.583 line:83%
Minoru.

657
00:43:40.833 --> 00:43:43.166 line:83%
I'm taking the day off tomorrow.

658
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.250 line:83%
What?

659
00:43:44.583 --> 00:43:46.083 line:83%
Then, I'm taking the day off, too.

660
00:43:46.166 --> 00:43:48.666 line:83%
Why? You need to work.

661
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.666 line:83%
Right...

662
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000 line:83%
Suzume.

663
00:43:53.083 --> 00:43:54.416 line:83%
Can you come down?

664
00:43:54.625 --> 00:43:55.875 line:83%
Okay!

665
00:43:58.666 --> 00:44:01.041 line:83%
Whoa! Rumi, you look gorgeous.

666
00:44:01.916 --> 00:44:03.208 line:83%
Like a different person, huh?

667
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:04.291 line:83%
The kids all good?

668
00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.458 line:83%
Yup. Sound asleep.

669
00:44:06.541 --> 00:44:08.666 line:83%
Then, you can give me a hand over here.

670
00:44:08.916 --> 00:44:11.583 line:83%
It's never this crowded...

671
00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:20.541 line:83%
Ma'am.

672
00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:21.791 line:83%
She's the help?

673
00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:23.000 line:83%
-Yep!
-What?

674
00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:25.125 line:83%
Welcome!

675
00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:27.541 line:83%
-You don't have to work the floor.
-Got it.

676
00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:32.458 line:83%
-Wash these. Quick.
-O-Okay.

677
00:44:32.541 --> 00:44:33.541 line:83%
-Ice, please!
-Coming!

678
00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:35.416 line:83%
-Two wine glasses.
-Huh?

679
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.416 line:83%
-No, the ones next to those.
-Right.

680
00:44:37.625 --> 00:44:38.916 line:83%
Welcome!

681
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:41.083 line:83%
Suzume, three hot towels.

682
00:44:41.166 --> 00:44:42.416 line:83%
Okay! Ow!

683
00:44:42.708 --> 00:44:43.833 line:83%
Where's the bottle?

684
00:44:43.916 --> 00:44:45.583 line:83%
-For "Sasaki."
-R-Right...

685
00:44:45.666 --> 00:44:50.625 line:83%
I had too much to drink
And it was all your fault...

686
00:44:51.166 --> 00:44:53.958 line:83%
How endearing it is
From a tender young lady...

687
00:44:54.041 --> 00:44:56.416 line:83%
You're awfully young, aren't you?

688
00:44:56.625 --> 00:44:58.125 line:83%
Come drink with an old lady.

689
00:44:58.208 --> 00:44:59.458 line:83%
Why don't we sing a duet?

690
00:44:59.541 --> 00:45:01.333 line:83%
Really? So ya like 'em young, do ya?

691
00:45:01.416 --> 00:45:04.375 line:83%
Why, thank you!

692
00:45:04.666 --> 00:45:07.083 line:83%
-Miki? You got us there.
-Oh well.

693
00:45:07.583 --> 00:45:09.916 line:83%
-What do you mean, "Oh well"?
-Hey, Daijin!

694
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.458 line:83%
Another glass!

695
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.000 line:83%
-Wha--?
-Daijin, you big spender.

696
00:45:15.083 --> 00:45:16.500 line:83%
You go!

697
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.833 line:83%
This isn't happening...

698
00:45:19.125 --> 00:45:21.208 line:83%
U-Umm... That seat over there.

699
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:25.625 line:83%
-Hm? Oh, he's a first-time customer.
-C-Customer--

700
00:45:25.708 --> 00:45:29.500 line:83%
He's quiet
but getting along with regulars already.

701
00:45:29.583 --> 00:45:32.875 line:83%
Um, but doesn't he look a bit...

702
00:45:33.083 --> 00:45:34.416 line:83%
...cat-like?

703
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.625 line:83%
You think so?

704
00:45:35.916 --> 00:45:38.750 line:83%
-Seems pretty refined to me.
-Seriously?

705
00:45:42.375 --> 00:45:43.791 line:83%
Oh, welcome!

706
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.875 line:83%
Sorry, but gotta go!

707
00:45:50.375 --> 00:45:52.791 line:83%
Souta! It's Daijin--!

708
00:45:59.416 --> 00:46:01.666 line:83%
Hey, just what are you--?

709
00:46:02.875 --> 00:46:05.875 line:83%
-Suzume. How you doin'?
-What?

710
00:46:07.916 --> 00:46:09.833 line:83%
Look. Over there.

711
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:11.958 line:83%
The worm.

712
00:46:15.875 --> 00:46:16.875 line:83%
Daijin!

713
00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:20.125 line:83%
Suzume! We need to go.

714
00:46:20.208 --> 00:46:21.208 line:83%
Yeah!

715
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.916 line:83%
Is it an earthquake?

716
00:46:28.125 --> 00:46:29.375 line:83%
Huh? Really?

717
00:46:29.458 --> 00:46:31.125 line:83%
Hey, Miki.

718
00:46:31.208 --> 00:46:32.291 line:83%
Where's Suzume?

719
00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:35.541 line:83%
It's the amusement park!

720
00:46:38.375 --> 00:46:39.875 line:83%
NOTICE OF CLOSURE

721
00:46:39.958 --> 00:46:41.875 line:83%
THANK YOU FOR 40 AMAZING YEARS

722
00:46:48.041 --> 00:46:49.166 line:83%
The Ferris wheel!

723
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:50.625 line:83%
It's become a Gate!

724
00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:55.375 line:83%
Souta, look!

725
00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.041 line:83%
Daijin.

726
00:47:01.083 --> 00:47:04.458 line:83%
I'm going to catch Daijin
and turn him back to a Keystone!

727
00:47:04.541 --> 00:47:06.875 line:83%
-While I do that, you...
-Yeah.

728
00:47:06.958 --> 00:47:08.791 line:83%
Close the door and lock it.

729
00:47:09.166 --> 00:47:10.333 line:83%
I can do this.

730
00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:19.041 line:83%
-Get the door!
-Okay!

731
00:47:25.958 --> 00:47:26.958 line:83%
I can make it!

732
00:47:32.125 --> 00:47:34.333 line:83%
My body... I can really move!

733
00:47:34.416 --> 00:47:35.708 line:83%
I'm getting used to this!

734
00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:37.708 line:83%
I won't fail again.

735
00:47:54.875 --> 00:47:56.958 line:83%
Suzume. You're goood!

736
00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:01.250 line:83%
Daijin...!

737
00:48:05.458 --> 00:48:09.125 line:83%
Today, you will turn me back!

738
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:25.000 line:83%
Look! The lights are on.

739
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:26.416 line:83%
Why?

740
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.500 line:83%
Wasn't it abandoned?

741
00:48:30.833 --> 00:48:31.875 line:83%
What?

742
00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:36.083 line:83%
Wh-Wh-Whoa--!

743
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000 line:83%
Wait!

744
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.500 line:83%
Seriously?

745
00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:05.291 line:83%
Mom...?

746
00:49:09.375 --> 00:49:11.791 line:83%
Become the Keystone, and seal that worm!

747
00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:14.958 line:83%
The Eastern Pillar alone will not hold.

748
00:49:15.041 --> 00:49:16.416 line:83%
-Can't...
-Why?

749
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.458 line:83%
I've entrusted this duty to you.

750
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:20.166 line:83%
What does that mean?

751
00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:21.541 line:83%
You go away.

752
00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.291 line:83%
Daijin's gonna play with Suzume.

753
00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:26.125 line:83%
With Suzume?

754
00:49:30.541 --> 00:49:31.541 line:83%
Suzume!

755
00:49:31.958 --> 00:49:33.541 line:83%
What happened, Suzume?

756
00:49:34.291 --> 00:49:36.791 line:83%
What's going on? What do you see?

757
00:49:39.333 --> 00:49:41.166 line:83%
Suzume? Come back.

758
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:42.291 line:83%
You mustn't go in!

759
00:49:43.166 --> 00:49:44.291 line:83%
Suzume!

760
00:49:53.291 --> 00:49:56.250 line:83%
Suzume, you're inside a Ferris wheel!

761
00:49:57.041 --> 00:50:00.250 line:83%
Wake up! You're going to fall!

762
00:50:00.458 --> 00:50:01.458 line:83%
Dammit.

763
00:50:01.708 --> 00:50:03.708 line:83%
O Divine Gods
who dwell beneath this land...

764
00:50:06.708 --> 00:50:09.291 line:83%
You have long protected us
for generations...

765
00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:13.375 line:83%
Your mountains and rivers...

766
00:50:13.458 --> 00:50:16.916 line:83%
-that we have long called our own...
-Whoa, it's so high up!

767
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.250 line:83%
-Cool!
-Don't have too much fun now.

768
00:50:19.333 --> 00:50:20.791 line:83%
We should come here again, together!

769
00:50:21.666 --> 00:50:23.791 line:83%
This is our anniversary. Let's come back.

770
00:50:23.875 --> 00:50:27.583 line:83%
An amusement park
on our first date is so cliché!

771
00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:31.500 line:83%
Daddy, let's come back again!

772
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.041 line:83%
Suzume! Come!

773
00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:37.791 line:83%
Souta?

774
00:50:50.208 --> 00:50:52.875 line:83%
O Divine Gods
who dwell beneath this land...

775
00:50:52.958 --> 00:50:55.208 line:83%
You have long protected us
for generations...

776
00:50:55.583 --> 00:50:58.291 line:83%
Your mountains and rivers...

777
00:50:59.166 --> 00:51:03.458 line:83%
that we have long called our own...

778
00:51:03.541 --> 00:51:04.708 line:83%
Now!

779
00:51:04.791 --> 00:51:06.375 line:83%
I return them to you!

780
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.041 line:83%
Where's Daijin?

781
00:51:19.458 --> 00:51:21.041 line:83%
Gone. Again.

782
00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:26.083 line:83%
Let's go inside.

783
00:51:29.666 --> 00:51:30.791 line:83%
What's wrong?

784
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:33.250 line:83%
I was so scared!

785
00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:38.583 line:83%
You were amazing. Thank you.

786
00:51:42.416 --> 00:51:43.583 line:83%
Suzume...

787
00:51:43.666 --> 00:51:46.666 line:83%
What were you looking at, beyond the Gate?

788
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.958 line:83%
A bright night sky filled
with stars and fields...

789
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:53.500 line:83%
The Ever-After.

790
00:51:53.583 --> 00:51:56.791 line:83%
-So you can see it...?
-"Ever-After"?

791
00:51:56.875 --> 00:51:59.500 line:83%
This world's other half,
where the worm dwells.

792
00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:02.291 line:83%
And, where all time exists simultaneously.

793
00:52:02.375 --> 00:52:04.250 line:83%
I could see it, but I couldn't go in.

794
00:52:04.916 --> 00:52:08.000 line:83%
The Ever-After
is where all souls go to rest.

795
00:52:09.208 --> 00:52:12.166 line:83%
It's not somewhere the living can reach.

796
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.958 line:83%
Not a place we're supposed to go.

797
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.791 line:83%
The troublemaker's back.

798
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.875 line:83%
Suzume, where were you?

799
00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:23.666 line:83%
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

800
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.500 line:83%
You had me worried sick!
Running off at this hour.

801
00:52:26.583 --> 00:52:28.333 line:83%
Well, she's all right, isn't she?

802
00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:29.666 line:83%
But--!

803
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.250 line:83%
How many times have we run away from home?

804
00:52:36.333 --> 00:52:38.708 line:83%
Why don't we have a bite for now.

805
00:52:38.791 --> 00:52:40.250 line:83%
Sorry...

806
00:52:40.916 --> 00:52:42.250 line:83%
How about fried udon?

807
00:52:42.333 --> 00:52:44.125 line:83%
Yeah! With a sunny side up on top.

808
00:52:44.208 --> 00:52:45.875 line:83%
-And tuna-mayo!
-Yeah.

809
00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:46.958 line:83%
And you, Suzume?

810
00:52:47.041 --> 00:52:49.041 line:83%
We actually put potato salad on top.

811
00:52:49.125 --> 00:52:51.000 line:83%
-Say what?
-On fried udon?

812
00:52:52.541 --> 00:52:54.125 line:83%
O-M-G.

813
00:52:55.666 --> 00:52:56.958 line:83%
Think about the calories.

814
00:52:57.041 --> 00:52:58.500 line:83%
Sooo hungry.

815
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.250 line:83%
Thanks for the meal!

816
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.708 line:83%
Delish!

817
00:53:05.791 --> 00:53:06.875 line:83%
I'll gain some weight.

818
00:53:06.958 --> 00:53:08.750 line:83%
-Needs a beer!
-Should we?

819
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:11.916 line:83%
-After drinking all night?
-Sure, why not?

820
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.708 line:83%
Join us, Souta.

821
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:15.791 line:83%
Didn't expect the potato salad, though.

822
00:53:15.875 --> 00:53:17.208 line:83%
-I'm making this for my boyfriend.
-H-Hey!

823
00:53:17.291 --> 00:53:18.666 line:83%
What boyfriend?

824
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.250 line:83%
I'll have one in no time.

825
00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.000 line:83%
What's with that chair?

826
00:53:22.083 --> 00:53:23.166 line:83%
Adorable.

827
00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.625 line:83%
-A kid's chair?
-Why are you on it?

828
00:53:25.708 --> 00:53:26.833 line:83%
A Kobe souvenir...?

829
00:53:26.916 --> 00:53:28.500 line:83%
You're not making any sense.

830
00:53:34.375 --> 00:53:36.250 line:83%
They must've thought you were weird.

831
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.916 line:83%
Really?

832
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.250 line:83%
Do you travel like this all the time?

833
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:42.750 line:83%
Not all the time.

834
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:44.333 line:83%
I have a flat in Tokyo.

835
00:53:45.208 --> 00:53:47.750 line:83%
After college, I plan to be a teacher.

836
00:53:49.625 --> 00:53:52.416 line:83%
-What? You're a university student?
-Yeah?

837
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.583 line:83%
And... a job?

838
00:53:53.666 --> 00:53:54.916 line:83%
What about this job?

839
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.333 line:83%
Being a Closer has been
in my family for generations.

840
00:53:58.416 --> 00:53:59.625 line:83%
I'll continue that.

841
00:54:00.458 --> 00:54:02.416 line:83%
But it doesn't put food on the table.

842
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.791 line:83%
I see...

843
00:54:04.416 --> 00:54:05.750 line:83%
But it's an important job.

844
00:54:06.208 --> 00:54:09.875 line:83%
Most important jobs, people shouldn't see.

845
00:54:10.416 --> 00:54:12.500 line:83%
I need to get back into my own body.

846
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.666 line:83%
So I can continue this
and become a teacher.

847
00:54:20.083 --> 00:54:21.833 line:83%
But... I'm already...

848
00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:29.083 line:83%
Perhaps, I'm...

849
00:54:30.125 --> 00:54:32.541 line:83%
already...

850
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.333 line:83%
It's getting farther.

851
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:43.583 line:83%
The light grows dimmer.

852
00:54:43.791 --> 00:54:45.458 line:83%
And so do the voices.

853
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:47.375 line:83%
My body...

854
00:54:47.791 --> 00:54:49.250 line:83%
My mind...

855
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.166 line:83%
It's so...

856
00:54:52.416 --> 00:54:53.416 line:83%
Cold.

857
00:54:53.666 --> 00:54:54.666 line:83%
I'm so cold.

858
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.291 line:83%
Cold...

859
00:55:12.791 --> 00:55:13.833 line:83%
Am I...

860
00:55:25.875 --> 00:55:27.208 line:83%
Is this where...

861
00:55:27.416 --> 00:55:28.958 line:83%
I meet my end?

862
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.416 line:83%
Souta?

863
00:55:40.375 --> 00:55:41.708 line:83%
Souta?

864
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000 line:83%
Good morning.

865
00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:50.500 line:83%
Took you long enough.

866
00:55:50.583 --> 00:55:53.500 line:83%
Hey, there's another photo of Daijin.

867
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.291 line:83%
See?

868
00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:57.416 line:83%
Suzume.

869
00:55:58.416 --> 00:55:59.416 line:83%
Did...

870
00:55:59.625 --> 00:56:01.291 line:83%
Did you just do something to me?

871
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:02.750 line:83%
Nope.

872
00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:06.666 line:83%
-The Chugoku Expressway south...
-I was counting on you to help me...

873
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:08.500 line:83%
-towards Okayama...
-at the bar tonight, too.

874
00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.708 line:83%
Here, this is for you.

875
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.333 line:83%
You look even more like
a runaway child now.

876
00:56:16.208 --> 00:56:18.833 line:83%
Rumi, thank you so much for everything.

877
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:20.291 line:83%
Mmhmm.

878
00:56:20.791 --> 00:56:23.541 line:83%
Just be sure to send word
to your guardian.

879
00:56:23.625 --> 00:56:24.625 line:83%
I will.

880
00:56:24.708 --> 00:56:27.500 line:83%
Ah, crap! I totally forgot about Tamaki.

881
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000 line:83%
55... unread messages?

882
00:56:29.416 --> 00:56:30.708 line:83%
She's coming to get me?

883
00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:32.666 line:83%
Suzume, you can make the next train.

884
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:34.750 line:83%
Buy a ticket. Hurry!

885
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.833 line:83%
The bullet train?

886
00:56:36.916 --> 00:56:39.750 line:83%
We know where Daijin is, so...

887
00:56:39.958 --> 00:56:41.250 line:83%
It's the quickest way, right?

888
00:56:41.666 --> 00:56:42.916 line:83%
To Tokyo, though?

889
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.916 line:83%
That'll take all my savings.

890
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.750 line:83%
You better pay me back, Mr. College Man.

891
00:56:47.833 --> 00:56:49.166 line:83%
I gotcha.

892
00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:52.000 line:83%
Souta, look!

893
00:56:52.333 --> 00:56:53.500 line:83%
What is it?

894
00:56:53.833 --> 00:56:55.750 line:83%
This train is so fast.

895
00:56:55.958 --> 00:56:57.125 line:83%
Cool!

896
00:56:57.208 --> 00:56:58.333 line:83%
Yeah... it's fast.

897
00:56:58.583 --> 00:57:01.583 line:83%
We will soon arrive at Atami.
The doors on the...

898
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.833 line:83%
-Souta, did we just...
-What's wrong?

899
00:57:05.916 --> 00:57:10.083 line:83%
Did we just miss Mt. Fuji? Look!

900
00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:12.916 line:83%
Why didn't you say something?

901
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.583 line:83%
Ahh, right...

902
00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:16.750 line:83%
I wanted to see it...

903
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.083 line:83%
Sorry...

904
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:21.583 line:83%
We'll soon be arriving at Tokyo.

905
00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:26.500 line:83%
Tokyo. This is the final stop.

906
00:57:26.583 --> 00:57:28.958 line:83%
-That way, Suzume.
-Okay!

907
00:57:29.041 --> 00:57:30.333 line:83%
Right. Left.

908
00:57:30.666 --> 00:57:31.833 line:83%
Go up.

909
00:57:32.041 --> 00:57:33.750 line:83%
Train on the left.

910
00:57:33.833 --> 00:57:34.833 line:83%
Run!

911
00:57:37.458 --> 00:57:39.083 line:83%
-Get off, next stop.
-Wha--?

912
00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:45.458 line:83%
Why do I feel like your horse?

913
00:57:46.041 --> 00:57:48.333 line:83%
Before Daijin,
there's a place I want to go.

914
00:57:49.291 --> 00:57:51.000 line:83%
Could you make a call?

915
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.583 line:83%
Welcome!

916
00:58:04.041 --> 00:58:06.708 line:83%
Um, my name is Iwato.

917
00:58:07.166 --> 00:58:09.375 line:83%
I just phoned...

918
00:58:10.541 --> 00:58:11.875 line:83%
Oh, right.

919
00:58:11.958 --> 00:58:13.750 line:83%
Souta's relative.

920
00:58:13.833 --> 00:58:15.458 line:83%
I heard about you.

921
00:58:15.875 --> 00:58:17.958 line:83%
Here's the key to his room.

922
00:58:18.375 --> 00:58:20.375 line:83%
Room 301.

923
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:21.833 line:83%
Take your time.

924
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.166 line:83%
Well, aren't you popular, Souta?

925
00:58:28.166 --> 00:58:30.666 line:83%
When is he coming back from his trip?

926
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:32.625 line:83%
It's a bit lonely without him.

927
00:58:34.625 --> 00:58:35.958 line:83%
And gorgeous.

928
00:58:36.583 --> 00:58:38.125 line:83%
Don't take them seriously...

929
00:58:38.208 --> 00:58:39.208 line:83%
Really...?

930
00:58:41.833 --> 00:58:42.916 line:83%
Welcome.

931
00:58:44.458 --> 00:58:45.875 line:83%
Scuse me...

932
00:58:54.083 --> 00:58:55.708 line:83%
I want to look something up.

933
00:58:56.916 --> 00:58:59.208 line:83%
See the cardboard box on top of the shelf?

934
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:01.666 line:83%
-Grab it for me.
-Sure.

935
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:05.833 line:83%
Oof...

936
00:59:14.166 --> 00:59:15.750 line:83%
Souta, can I step on you?

937
00:59:16.083 --> 00:59:17.458 line:83%
Ask that before you do it!

938
00:59:22.958 --> 00:59:24.791 line:83%
SECRET ARTS OF CLOSERS VOL.1

939
00:59:27.708 --> 00:59:30.958 line:83%
Is this... the worm?

940
00:59:33.416 --> 00:59:34.416 line:83%
Yeah.

941
00:59:34.666 --> 00:59:36.208 line:83%
And this is the Keystone.

942
00:59:36.875 --> 00:59:38.208 line:83%
The Western Pillar.

943
00:59:38.291 --> 00:59:39.500 line:83%
And the Eastern Pillar.

944
00:59:39.583 --> 00:59:41.041 line:83%
Then does that mean...

945
00:59:41.125 --> 00:59:42.333 line:83%
...there are two Keystones.

946
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.458 line:83%
Disasters that couldn't be contained
by closing the Gate

947
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:49.458 line:83%
were sealed away using the Keystones.

948
00:59:50.375 --> 00:59:52.541 line:83%
So... The locations change era to era.

949
00:59:55.708 --> 00:59:59.583 line:83%
The Keystone from Kyushu
is now running around as Daijin.

950
00:59:59.666 --> 01:00:02.375 line:83%
-Yeah.
-The other Keystone is here.

951
01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:03.791 line:83%
In Tokyo.

952
01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:05.708 line:83%
Keeping the worm's head at bay.

953
01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:09.208 line:83%
What I want to know is exactly where...

954
01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.291 line:83%
Where in Tokyo it is.

955
01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.708 line:83%
Apparently, there's a huge Gate there too.

956
01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:18.583 line:83%
It opened 100 years ago
and decimated the Kanto region.

957
01:00:18.666 --> 01:00:21.166 line:83%
And was shut by the Closers of that time.

958
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.625 line:83%
Tokyo's Gate.

959
01:00:22.708 --> 01:00:23.708 line:83%
CLOSER'S JOURNAL

960
01:00:23.791 --> 01:00:27.458 line:83%
Perhaps Daijin is trying to
open that door once more.

961
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:35.583 line:83%
It's no use...

962
01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:38.666 line:83%
The information has been blotted out.

963
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:40.958 line:83%
Why? Is the location a secret?

964
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:43.000 line:83%
I've gotta ask Grandpa.

965
01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:44.416 line:83%
Grandpa?

966
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.125 line:83%
He pretty much raised me.

967
01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:47.750 line:83%
He's in a hospital nearby.

968
01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:51.958 line:83%
I didn't want to disappoint him...
looking like this.

969
01:00:54.166 --> 01:00:56.958 line:83%
Souta, you in there? I know you are.

970
01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:59.208 line:83%
-The window's open.
-It's Serizawa.

971
01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:00.583 line:83%
Of all the times...

972
01:01:00.666 --> 01:01:02.625 line:83%
-Wh-Who?
-Someone I know.

973
01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:04.083 line:83%
Just make him go away.

974
01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:05.958 line:83%
Souta! I'm opening the door, dude.

975
01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:07.458 line:83%
I'm coming in. I warned ya.

976
01:01:07.708 --> 01:01:09.208 line:83%
He's a good guy.

977
01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:12.708 line:83%
Hello.

978
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:15.041 line:83%
Um, and you are?

979
01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:18.000 line:83%
-His younger sister.
-He's got a sister?

980
01:01:18.083 --> 01:01:20.708 line:83%
Well... A cousin who's like
a younger sister, really.

981
01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:22.208 line:83%
-What?
-Umm...

982
01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:24.375 line:83%
You're Serizawa, right?

983
01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:28.916 line:83%
-Teacher employment exam?
-Yeah.

984
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.208 line:83%
Yesterday was the second one,
but he didn't show up.

985
01:01:33.708 --> 01:01:35.458 line:83%
He had a test yesterday?

986
01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:37.958 line:83%
What an idiot...

987
01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:40.458 line:83%
Four years right down the drain.

988
01:01:40.916 --> 01:01:44.083 line:83%
It bothered me so much,
I couldn't focus on my test.

989
01:01:44.833 --> 01:01:46.958 line:83%
Say, you... Suzume, was it?

990
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.000 line:83%
When you get a hold of Souta,

991
01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:52.083 line:83%
tell him that I'm pissed,
and that he's dead to me.

992
01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.458 line:83%
Ah, wait.

993
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:55.000 line:83%
He owes me 20,000 yen.

994
01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:56.375 line:83%
I want that first.

995
01:01:56.875 --> 01:02:00.208 line:83%
I heard his family business
was in trouble and all...

996
01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:03.041 line:83%
But, he doesn't
take care of himself enough.

997
01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:04.375 line:83%
Ticks me off.

998
01:02:05.958 --> 01:02:07.041 line:83%
See ya.

999
01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:11.416 line:83%
EARTHQUAKE WARNING

1000
01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:12.916 line:83%
Is there gonna be a quake?

1001
01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:14.458 line:83%
Hey, what are you--?

1002
01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:16.833 line:83%
It stopped...

1003
01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:18.958 line:83%
You okay?

1004
01:02:20.958 --> 01:02:21.958 line:83%
It's close.

1005
01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:28.125 line:83%
Whoa, that's a lot of birds.

1006
01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:29.708 line:83%
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

1007
01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:32.708 line:83%
Hey, where are you going?

1008
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.958 line:83%
I had no idea.

1009
01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:37.208 line:83%
About your test!

1010
01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:39.500 line:83%
-What do we do?
-It's not your fault!

1011
01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:41.583 line:83%
But it's all because I freed the Keystone!

1012
01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:43.041 line:83%
We put an end to it today.

1013
01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:47.000 line:83%
We return the cat to the Keystone,
and I become human again.

1014
01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:51.708 line:83%
-What's going on?
-There's so many birds!

1015
01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:53.958 line:83%
Because of the earthquake?

1016
01:02:58.333 --> 01:03:00.708 line:83%
-Hey, where's the Gate?
-Yeah.

1017
01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:03.333 line:83%
Looks like it's downriver.

1018
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:08.291 line:83%
Oh my.

1019
01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:09.833 line:83%
A cat?

1020
01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:12.958 line:83%
Suzume!

1021
01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:14.625 line:83%
Let's play.

1022
01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.208 line:83%
-Daijin!
-H-Hey--!

1023
01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.958 line:83%
-What was that?
-A chair?

1024
01:03:30.041 --> 01:03:31.458 line:83%
-Did you see that?
-What was it?

1025
01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.208 line:83%
What?

1026
01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:34.833 line:83%
Daijin!

1027
01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:36.458 line:83%
Return to the Keystone!

1028
01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:38.458 line:83%
One is not enough!

1029
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.208 line:83%
-Nope.
-Why?

1030
01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:42.958 line:83%
You still don't get it?

1031
01:03:46.875 --> 01:03:48.000 line:83%
Where'd you go?

1032
01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:50.166 line:83%
Souta?

1033
01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:01.958 line:83%
Tokyo's Gate is...

1034
01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:03.708 line:83%
down there?

1035
01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:06.208 line:83%
How do we even get there?

1036
01:04:26.666 --> 01:04:27.666 line:83%
It stopped?

1037
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:29.291 line:83%
No.

1038
01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:34.458 line:83%
What the...?

1039
01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:40.708 line:83%
It's no use...

1040
01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:53.875 line:83%
Earthquake warning.

1041
01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:54.958 line:83%
EARTHQUAKE WARNING

1042
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.500 line:83%
The warning stopped.

1043
01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:58.041 line:83%
What's going on?

1044
01:04:58.125 --> 01:04:59.375 line:83%
The second Keystone...

1045
01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:02.166 line:83%
It couldn't hold it.

1046
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.458 line:83%
The whole body is coming out!

1047
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:12.458 line:83%
Daijin?

1048
01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:14.666 line:83%
We will prevent a major earthquake.

1049
01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:16.708 line:83%
Suzume. I'm going.

1050
01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:19.208 line:83%
You can't be serious!

1051
01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:20.458 line:83%
Souta!

1052
01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:30.125 line:83%
Hey, is that...?

1053
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.375 line:83%
-Wait!
-Wha--?

1054
01:05:33.708 --> 01:05:35.125 line:83%
Suzume?

1055
01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:40.375 line:83%
What's going on?

1056
01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:44.375 line:83%
-What's that?
-Something's weird...

1057
01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:52.375 line:83%
-Are you crazy?
-But...

1058
01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:55.458 line:83%
Suzume!!

1059
01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:03.958 line:83%
I'm coming!

1060
01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:13.541 line:83%
-Souta?
-The surface is unstable.

1061
01:06:13.625 --> 01:06:14.666 line:83%
Don't let go.

1062
01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:16.375 line:83%
Okay.

1063
01:06:33.166 --> 01:06:37.916 line:83%
EARTHQUAKE EPICENTER THE 23 DISTRICTS

1064
01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:13.833 line:83%
The worm...

1065
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.833 line:83%
is covering the city.

1066
01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:22.083 line:83%
-Souta!
-I know!

1067
01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:25.250 line:83%
We need to pierce it with the Keystone...
with Daijin.

1068
01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:26.583 line:83%
Suzume!

1069
01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:30.083 line:83%
When the worm falls...

1070
01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:32.083 line:83%
the earth will break.

1071
01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:33.333 line:83%
Daijin!

1072
01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:37.541 line:83%
Souta?

1073
01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:39.916 line:83%
What's the matter?

1074
01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:42.583 line:83%
A lot of people...

1075
01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:44.083 line:83%
are about to die.

1076
01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:45.833 line:83%
Why would you let that happen?

1077
01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:47.666 line:83%
Become the Keystone again!

1078
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.666 line:83%
Can't. I'm no longer the Keystone.

1079
01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:57.708 line:83%
You are the Keystone.

1080
01:07:57.791 --> 01:07:58.833 line:83%
Hey!

1081
01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:05.000 line:83%
What should we do, Souta?

1082
01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:06.750 line:83%
Souta?

1083
01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.458 line:83%
Suzume... I'm sorry.

1084
01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:12.250 line:83%
I finally understand.

1085
01:08:12.333 --> 01:08:13.916 line:83%
I didn't realize...

1086
01:08:14.416 --> 01:08:16.083 line:83%
or maybe didn't want to.

1087
01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:18.375 line:83%
Um, Souta? Your body...

1088
01:08:18.458 --> 01:08:20.416 line:83%
-Now...
-It's freezing!

1089
01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:24.125 line:83%
I am... the Keystone.

1090
01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:26.416 line:83%
The moment I became a chair,

1091
01:08:26.708 --> 01:08:29.666 line:83%
the role of a Keystone
was passed on to me.

1092
01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:31.958 line:83%
That can't be...

1093
01:08:32.583 --> 01:08:34.833 line:83%
This is it...

1094
01:08:35.166 --> 01:08:36.416 line:83%
This is where I end?

1095
01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:37.916 line:83%
Souta?

1096
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.875 line:83%
But, I was able to meet you.

1097
01:08:42.458 --> 01:08:45.125 line:83%
Souta? Souta?

1098
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:46.500 line:83%
Hey! Souta!

1099
01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:49.375 line:83%
Souta?

1100
01:08:50.583 --> 01:08:52.250 line:83%
That's not Souta anymore.

1101
01:08:52.541 --> 01:08:54.416 line:83%
Daijin... How dare you--!

1102
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.041 line:83%
Aren't you going to stick that
into the worm?

1103
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.500 line:83%
How could I?

1104
01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.000 line:83%
The worm's gonna fall.

1105
01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:03.000 line:83%
The earth will break.

1106
01:09:11.416 --> 01:09:13.041 line:83%
It's falling...

1107
01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:16.416 line:83%
Souta! Please, wake up! Souta!

1108
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.000 line:83%
That's not Souta anymore!

1109
01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:21.250 line:83%
Souta, wake up!

1110
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:23.583 line:83%
What am I supposed to do?

1111
01:09:23.875 --> 01:09:26.000 line:83%
Souta? Souta!

1112
01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:28.000 line:83%
Lots'a people are gonna die.

1113
01:09:29.083 --> 01:09:30.750 line:83%
History will repeat...

1114
01:09:49.708 --> 01:09:50.791 line:83%
I don't...

1115
01:09:51.708 --> 01:09:53.625 line:83%
I never wanted this...

1116
01:09:53.708 --> 01:09:55.375 line:83%
How can this...?

1117
01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:18.625 line:83%
-Hey, look at that!
-Wow!

1118
01:10:18.708 --> 01:10:20.541 line:83%
-Aurora?
-Rainbow at night?

1119
01:10:20.625 --> 01:10:21.958 line:83%
Beautiful...

1120
01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:10.041 line:83%
Mommy! Is it ready yet?

1121
01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:11.625 line:83%
Not even close.

1122
01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:22.125 line:83%
-Now?
-Not yet.

1123
01:11:29.416 --> 01:11:32.458 line:83%
-Now?
-Hmm, almost?

1124
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.833 line:83%
Nooow?

1125
01:11:36.916 --> 01:11:38.458 line:83%
Let's see...

1126
01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:42.125 line:83%
Here you go!

1127
01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:44.666 line:83%
Happy birthday, Suzume.

1128
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:46.250 line:83%
Whoooa.

1129
01:11:46.625 --> 01:11:49.916 line:83%
-Hey, is its face here?
-What?

1130
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000 line:83%
This is a chair.

1131
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:52.208 line:83%
Just for you.

1132
01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:58.041 line:83%
How's that?

1133
01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:04.125 line:83%
A chair for me!

1134
01:12:04.208 --> 01:12:06.541 line:83%
Thank you, Mommy!

1135
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:10.541 line:83%
I'm gonna keep it forever and ever!

1136
01:12:10.625 --> 01:12:12.333 line:83%
Forever?

1137
01:12:12.416 --> 01:12:15.291 line:83%
Well, thank goodness I built it for you.

1138
01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:18.958 line:83%
MAY 24: TODAY MY MOM BUILT ME A CHAIR...

1139
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.208 line:83%
How long...

1140
01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:24.125 line:83%
did I actually care for it?

1141
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.125 line:83%
Where...

1142
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.000 line:83%
...am I?

1143
01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:45.333 line:83%
Souta?

1144
01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:56.125 line:83%
Is this...?

1145
01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.583 line:83%
Tokyo's Gate?

1146
01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:12.583 line:83%
Souta?

1147
01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:26.333 line:83%
I can't get in.

1148
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.250 line:83%
He's in the Ever-After.

1149
01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:30.750 line:83%
Souta.

1150
01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:33.083 line:83%
Souta? Souta!

1151
01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:35.041 line:83%
Souta!

1152
01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:39.083 line:83%
Suzume?

1153
01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:45.583 line:83%
Finally, just the two of us!

1154
01:13:46.375 --> 01:13:48.500 line:83%
This is all your fault!

1155
01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:50.625 line:83%
-Give me Souta back!
-Can't.

1156
01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:53.666 line:83%
-Why?
-He's not human anymore.

1157
01:13:56.041 --> 01:13:57.666 line:83%
Then make him human!

1158
01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:00.333 line:83%
-Suzume, that hurts.
-Bring him back!

1159
01:14:00.416 --> 01:14:02.250 line:83%
I said that hurts!

1160
01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:03.583 line:83%
You--!

1161
01:14:04.208 --> 01:14:06.583 line:83%
You don't love me?

1162
01:14:06.666 --> 01:14:09.000 line:83%
-How could I--?
-You love me, right?

1163
01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:10.083 line:83%
I hate--!

1164
01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:21.583 line:83%
Go away.

1165
01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.833 line:83%
Don't ever talk to me again.

1166
01:14:25.708 --> 01:14:29.083 line:83%
Suzume doesn't love me...

1167
01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:45.875 line:83%
I promise, I'll come save you.

1168
01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.541 line:83%
I return them to you...

1169
01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:14.291 line:83%
What--?

1170
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:32.541 line:83%
Hey, look at that girl.

1171
01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:34.041 line:83%
She's not wearing any shoes.

1172
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.291 line:83%
You're right. Ew.

1173
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.541 line:83%
Just look at her clothes.

1174
01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:45.625 line:83%
That girl over there. Is she barefoot?

1175
01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:46.791 line:83%
For real?

1176
01:15:49.041 --> 01:15:51.125 line:83%
Munakata's condition has stabilized.

1177
01:15:51.208 --> 01:15:53.208 line:83%
Yeah, it was pretty bad yesterday.

1178
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:54.750 line:83%
HITSUJIRO MUNAKATA

1179
01:15:54.833 --> 01:15:56.041 line:83%
Souta's...

1180
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:12.416 line:83%
Souta failed, didn't he?

1181
01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.708 line:83%
I-I'm sorry for barging in...

1182
01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:18.291 line:83%
I heard from Souta
that you were in the hospital.

1183
01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:24.791 line:83%
Did he drag you into this?

1184
01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:28.500 line:83%
What is the fate of my grandson?

1185
01:16:29.916 --> 01:16:32.625 line:83%
He became a Keystone
and went to the Ever-After...

1186
01:16:33.041 --> 01:16:34.791 line:83%
I see.

1187
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:39.291 line:83%
I saw the worm from my window yesterday.

1188
01:16:39.916 --> 01:16:42.708 line:83%
I wanted nothing more than to go myself...

1189
01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:46.958 line:83%
but this old body of mine wouldn't listen.

1190
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:51.375 line:83%
That's why I want to know
how to enter the Ever-After.

1191
01:16:53.541 --> 01:16:54.541 line:83%
Why?

1192
01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:57.041 line:83%
Huh? Because... we have to save Souta!

1193
01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:59.541 line:83%
-That isn't necessary.
-What?

1194
01:17:00.125 --> 01:17:03.541 line:83%
Souta will spend decades now

1195
01:17:03.625 --> 01:17:07.208 line:83%
as a Keystone housing the gods.

1196
01:17:07.291 --> 01:17:10.791 line:83%
He is no longer of our realm.

1197
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.583 line:83%
How could... But there must be a way to--

1198
01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:17.458 line:83%
Are you trying to
waste my grandson's sacrifice?

1199
01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:21.458 line:83%
-What?
-Who is the one who pierced the worm?

1200
01:17:21.541 --> 01:17:24.708 line:83%
-Did you, with Souta?
-But that was...

1201
01:17:24.791 --> 01:17:25.958 line:83%
Answer me!

1202
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.041 line:83%
It was me!

1203
01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:30.500 line:83%
I see. That's fine!

1204
01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:33.916 line:83%
If you didn't, millions would have died!

1205
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.041 line:83%
Take pride in your deed,
keep your mouth shut,

1206
01:17:37.125 --> 01:17:39.791 line:83%
and return to whence you came!

1207
01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:49.708 line:83%
This world is not for the ordinary.

1208
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:52.791 line:83%
Forget everything that happened.

1209
01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.458 line:83%
How could I forget?

1210
01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:58.375 line:83%
I'll open the underground Gate again.

1211
01:17:58.458 --> 01:18:00.708 line:83%
What? What are you saying?

1212
01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:03.291 line:83%
-I have to get in!
-Impossible.

1213
01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:05.041 line:83%
You cannot enter it there!

1214
01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:07.291 line:83%
You mustn't open the Gate!

1215
01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:08.500 line:83%
Wait!

1216
01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:23.083 line:83%
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

1217
01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:25.041 line:83%
But it is the domain of the departed.

1218
01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:28.208 line:83%
Does that not scare you?

1219
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.291 line:83%
It doesn't.

1220
01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:33.291 line:83%
Whether one lives or dies
is a matter of luck.

1221
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.041 line:83%
I've always felt that way.

1222
01:18:35.291 --> 01:18:36.291 line:83%
But...

1223
01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:40.583 line:83%
I'm afraid of a world without Souta.

1224
01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:54.250 line:83%
There is but one Gate through which
people may traverse in their lifetime.

1225
01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:57.291 line:83%
You've been to the Ever-After before, no?

1226
01:18:57.708 --> 01:19:00.166 line:83%
What did you see there?

1227
01:19:00.666 --> 01:19:02.041 line:83%
That was...

1228
01:19:02.291 --> 01:19:04.041 line:83%
A young version of myself.

1229
01:19:04.541 --> 01:19:07.708 line:83%
And, my mom... who passed away.

1230
01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:09.291 line:83%
I suspect

1231
01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:14.291 line:83%
you got lost in the Ever-After
when you were young.

1232
01:19:20.458 --> 01:19:24.791 line:83%
You must find that Gate. From back then.

1233
01:19:35.291 --> 01:19:37.833 line:83%
It has been far too long.

1234
01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:41.708 line:83%
I see you are finally unbound.

1235
01:19:43.916 --> 01:19:47.083 line:83%
Do you wish to follow that girl?

1236
01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:50.333 line:83%
I entrust everything to you.

1237
01:20:29.208 --> 01:20:32.083 line:83%
I'm borrowing your shoes, Souta.

1238
01:20:45.583 --> 01:20:46.583 line:83%
Hey!

1239
01:20:46.666 --> 01:20:48.500 line:83%
Hey, you!

1240
01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:50.291 line:83%
Suzume!

1241
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.375 line:83%
Serizawa?

1242
01:20:53.458 --> 01:20:54.500 line:83%
Where are you going?

1243
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.333 line:83%
To find Souta?

1244
01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:59.625 line:83%
-To find a door.
-What?

1245
01:20:59.708 --> 01:21:01.125 line:83%
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

1246
01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:03.208 line:83%
Hey, I looked everywhere for you!

1247
01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:05.166 line:83%
-What are--
-The cousin thing's a lie, right?

1248
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:06.250 line:83%
Why does it matter?

1249
01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.500 line:83%
-Get in.
-What?

1250
01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:09.166 line:83%
You're going after Souta, right?

1251
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.166 line:83%
Then, I'll take you.

1252
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.625 line:83%
Why would you--?

1253
01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:14.750 line:83%
I'm worried about my friend, okay?

1254
01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:16.541 line:83%
-What's that?
-A fight?

1255
01:21:16.625 --> 01:21:18.500 line:83%
There you are! Suzume!!

1256
01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:20.666 line:83%
W-What? Tamaki?

1257
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:23.833 line:83%
Do you have any idea
how worried I've been?

1258
01:21:24.041 --> 01:21:26.250 line:83%
And you! You stay away from her.

1259
01:21:26.333 --> 01:21:28.333 line:83%
-Or I'll call the police.
-Who're you?

1260
01:21:28.541 --> 01:21:30.208 line:83%
Is this the guy who came to our house?

1261
01:21:30.291 --> 01:21:32.250 line:83%
Whatever he told you is a lie.

1262
01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:33.583 line:83%
We're going.

1263
01:21:33.833 --> 01:21:35.333 line:83%
I'm sorry, but I can't yet.

1264
01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:36.666 line:83%
Suzume!

1265
01:21:37.041 --> 01:21:38.416 line:83%
Serizawa, let's go.

1266
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.666 line:83%
O-Okay.

1267
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.541 line:83%
-H-Hey!
-Suzume!

1268
01:21:43.625 --> 01:21:45.083 line:83%
What the heck is wrong with you?

1269
01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.750 line:83%
I can't let you go alone.

1270
01:21:46.833 --> 01:21:49.000 line:83%
-Tamaki, get out.
-Come here, Suzume.

1271
01:21:49.083 --> 01:21:50.916 line:83%
This car has doors, you know!

1272
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.416 line:83%
Is he two-timing?

1273
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.500 line:83%
Men are such pigs.

1274
01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:55.791 line:83%
-Yeah, and you ignored them!
-Let's all calm dow--

1275
01:21:55.875 --> 01:21:58.000 line:83%
Are you guys... done yet?

1276
01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:02.791 line:83%
-Daijin?
-A cat spoke?

1277
01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:04.333 line:83%
What? Of course not...

1278
01:22:04.916 --> 01:22:06.708 line:83%
Yeah, you're right.

1279
01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:09.291 line:83%
Sure, cats don't talk.

1280
01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:10.833 line:83%
More importantly...

1281
01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:14.666 line:83%
-Destination confirmed.
-Serizawa, can you take us here?

1282
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:16.333 line:83%
W-Whaaat? This is far!

1283
01:22:16.541 --> 01:22:18.208 line:83%
Suzume, isn't this...?

1284
01:22:18.291 --> 01:22:20.583 line:83%
You said you would take me, didn't you?

1285
01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:23.666 line:83%
Please, I have to go there.

1286
01:22:28.541 --> 01:22:30.083 line:83%
Seriously...?

1287
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000 line:83%
Guess we're not comin' back tonight...

1288
01:22:37.916 --> 01:22:40.333 line:83%
What are you trying to pull?

1289
01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:55.208 line:83%
In order to see his mom...

1290
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.500 line:83%
I boarded the train all on my own!

1291
01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:07.000 line:83%
...The twilit cityscape

1292
01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:09.208 line:83%
And cars passing by

1293
01:23:09.291 --> 01:23:14.083 line:83%
I watched out the corner of my eye

1294
01:23:14.166 --> 01:23:15.708 line:83%
Do you mind?

1295
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:18.500 line:83%
What? This is the perfect road trip song.

1296
01:23:18.583 --> 01:23:20.541 line:83%
And we have a cat...

1297
01:23:20.625 --> 01:23:22.583 line:83%
Suzume's not listening.

1298
01:23:22.791 --> 01:23:24.125 line:83%
She's asleep.

1299
01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:27.333 line:83%
Hey, is that cat hers?

1300
01:23:27.541 --> 01:23:29.833 line:83%
We don't have any cats.

1301
01:23:29.916 --> 01:23:31.333 line:83%
Serizawa...

1302
01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:33.291 line:83%
You're a teacher in training?

1303
01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.833 line:83%
Um, yeah... I wanna become one.

1304
01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:40.083 line:83%
Is this car okay?

1305
01:23:40.166 --> 01:23:42.458 line:83%
It's used. I got it super cheap.

1306
01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:43.583 line:83%
Cool, huh?

1307
01:23:43.916 --> 01:23:46.166 line:83%
Are you sure you want to do this?

1308
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:48.583 line:83%
It's more than seven hours one way.

1309
01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:52.208 line:83%
Your daughter's not
the only one looking for Souta.

1310
01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:54.333 line:83%
She's not my daughter...

1311
01:23:54.916 --> 01:23:56.958 line:83%
She's my niece.

1312
01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.833 line:83%
My older sister passed away,
so I took her in.

1313
01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:02.833 line:83%
-She was a single mom.
-I see.

1314
01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:06.000 line:83%
Back then, Suzume was only four.

1315
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.666 line:83%
She couldn't process her mother
disappearing so suddenly...

1316
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:12.625 line:83%
and got lost trying to search for her.

1317
01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:13.958 line:83%
Suzume!

1318
01:24:14.041 --> 01:24:15.833 line:83%
Suzume, where are you?

1319
01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:18.041 line:83%
Suzume!!

1320
01:24:20.916 --> 01:24:24.000 line:83%
-Auntie?
-Everything's all right now.

1321
01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:26.833 line:83%
I'm so sorry
it took me so long to find you.

1322
01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:30.333 line:83%
Starting today, you're my daughter, okay?

1323
01:24:33.375 --> 01:24:35.416 line:83%
It's been 12 years since that day.

1324
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.000 line:83%
I took her with me to Kyushu,
and we've lived together ever since.

1325
01:24:43.916 --> 01:24:45.583 line:83%
Oh, do you mind the smoke?

1326
01:24:46.083 --> 01:24:48.583 line:83%
It's your car.

1327
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.166 line:83%
So, we're headed for
Suzume's hometown then?

1328
01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:55.125 line:83%
-Is Souta really gonna be there?
-I don't know...

1329
01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:58.083 line:83%
But there's nothing left there.

1330
01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.083 line:83%
Say, why don't we head back to Tokyo?

1331
01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:03.625 line:83%
That'll make her give up.

1332
01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:07.125 line:83%
Souta owes me money, and I need it back.

1333
01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:11.416 line:83%
So you're a loan shark now?

1334
01:25:12.125 --> 01:25:18.083 line:83%
And she'll be so mad at you, my darling!

1337
01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.458 line:83%
I guess it's the pain

1338
01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:36.333 line:83%
That brings back those memories

1339
01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:41.583 line:83%
All of the ones that I
Thought were all dead and gone

1340
01:25:42.166 --> 01:25:44.166 line:83%
Did you just feel something shake?

1341
01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:45.875 line:83%
Look who decided to join us.

1342
01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.083 line:83%
Now your aunt's asleep.

1343
01:25:48.291 --> 01:25:50.333 line:83%
Does your family not know how to sleep?

1345
01:25:52.166 --> 01:25:54.833 line:83%
-You're right. I didn't realize it.
-Stop!

1346
01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:02.458 line:83%
Hey, wa--!

1347
01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:03.833 line:83%
Suzume!

1348
01:26:24.416 --> 01:26:25.416 line:83%
It's not appearing.

1349
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:28.708 line:83%
Souta must be containing it.

1350
01:26:30.833 --> 01:26:31.916 line:83%
Daijin...

1351
01:26:32.291 --> 01:26:34.166 line:83%
What are you trying to do?

1352
01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:36.750 line:83%
Why won't you say anything?

1353
01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.625 line:83%
Hey, can anyone...

1354
01:26:40.125 --> 01:26:41.416 line:83%
become a Keystone?

1355
01:26:42.208 --> 01:26:43.833 line:83%
Not just Closers?

1356
01:26:43.916 --> 01:26:44.916 line:83%
Heeey!

1357
01:26:45.958 --> 01:26:47.416 line:83%
Suzume.

1358
01:26:49.833 --> 01:26:51.500 line:83%
What's up with you?

1359
01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:53.791 line:83%
Sorry, it's nothing.

1360
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.333 line:83%
Gotta hurry.

1361
01:26:58.083 --> 01:27:00.291 line:83%
We're about halfway now.

1362
01:27:15.333 --> 01:27:18.833 line:83%
I didn't know this area was so beautiful.

1363
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:22.250 line:83%
This place is... beautiful?

1364
01:27:28.125 --> 01:27:30.583 line:83%
Sorry, we need to get going.

1365
01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:40.666 line:83%
Hey. Hey, you...

1366
01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:42.583 line:83%
Cat!

1367
01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.750 line:83%
Man...

1368
01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:47.083 line:83%
Your family's got some serious issues...

1369
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:56.416 line:83%
What is it you're looking for?

1370
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.708 line:83%
Something hard to find?

1371
01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:02.916 line:83%
In your bag, through your desk

1372
01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:06.250 line:83%
You looked but can't find it

1373
01:28:06.458 --> 01:28:09.166 line:83%
Do you want to keep searching?

1374
01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:12.500 line:83%
Why not dance with me instead?

1375
01:28:12.583 --> 01:28:15.916 line:83%
Into our dreams, on into our dreams

1376
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.500 line:83%
Wouldn't you rather roam a bit?

1377
01:28:21.125 --> 01:28:23.791 line:83%
-Rain?
-Seriously?

1378
01:28:23.875 --> 01:28:25.291 line:83%
Well, that's not good...

1379
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:27.708 line:83%
Why? You have a roof, don't you?

1380
01:28:27.791 --> 01:28:29.041 line:83%
Just close it.

1381
01:28:30.208 --> 01:28:31.916 line:83%
Let's give it a go.

1382
01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:50.958 line:83%
Hey...

1383
01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:52.750 line:83%
Yep, still broken.

1384
01:28:52.833 --> 01:28:55.125 line:83%
-Haha.
-Don't "Haha" me!

1385
01:28:55.208 --> 01:28:57.208 line:83%
-How're you gonna fix this?
-No worries.

1386
01:28:57.291 --> 01:28:59.416 line:83%
We're almost to the next rest stop.

1387
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.916 line:83%
Approximately 40 km to your destination.
ETA 35 minutes.

1388
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.750 line:83%
Almost, my foot!

OYA KAIGAN -REST STOP

1390
01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:09.250 line:83%
The time is 3:30 p.m.

1391
01:29:10.541 --> 01:29:11.750 line:83%
Thanks for the grub!

1392
01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.833 line:83%
What? You're with some shady playboy?

1393
01:29:17.916 --> 01:29:21.958 line:83%
Well, more like a discount hustler,

1394
01:29:22.041 --> 01:29:24.750 line:83%
but I don't think he's up to anything.

1395
01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:26.833 line:83%
That's super dangerous!

1396
01:29:27.208 --> 01:29:30.416 line:83%
It's just you two girls.
A closed car's dangerous!

1397
01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.333 line:83%
Well, it's a convertible.

1398
01:29:32.583 --> 01:29:33.583 line:83%
That's even worse!

1399
01:29:33.791 --> 01:29:36.625 line:83%
-Tamaki, where in Miyagi are you now?
-Tamaki again?

1400
01:29:37.583 --> 01:29:39.833 line:83%
-Minoru doesn't give up, does he?
-Wait one sec.

1401
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:44.708 line:83%
There's a bus at that rest stop
headed for Tokyo.

1402
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.625 line:83%
And there are open seats.

1403
01:29:46.833 --> 01:29:47.958 line:83%
I can book 'em right now.

1404
01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:49.958 line:83%
Just hold up, Minoru.

1405
01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:52.250 line:83%
We've come quite a ways...

1406
01:29:52.333 --> 01:29:53.750 line:83%
I don't think that...

1409
01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:15.875 line:83%
Suzume, it just shook again, huh?

1410
01:30:16.208 --> 01:30:18.166 line:83%
There have been so many
earthquakes lately.

1411
01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:22.708 line:83%
Hey, you sure
you don't want anything to eat?

1412
01:30:23.291 --> 01:30:24.333 line:83%
Yup.

1413
01:30:27.375 --> 01:30:28.750 line:83%
Suzume...

1414
01:30:28.833 --> 01:30:31.625 line:83%
Could you tell me?

1415
01:30:31.708 --> 01:30:32.708 line:83%
What?

1416
01:30:33.416 --> 01:30:36.250 line:83%
Why are you so hell-bent
on returning home?

1417
01:30:36.791 --> 01:30:38.000 line:83%
A door...

1418
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:40.458 line:83%
Sorry, it's hard to explain.

1419
01:30:41.125 --> 01:30:42.208 line:83%
What's that mean?

1420
01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:44.708 line:83%
After all the trouble you've caused!

1421
01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:46.000 line:83%
Trouble?

1422
01:30:46.416 --> 01:30:49.208 line:83%
You wouldn't understand anyway, Tamaki.

1423
01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:52.833 line:83%
That's it. We're taking that bus home.

1424
01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:54.333 line:83%
You won't tell me anything.

1425
01:30:54.416 --> 01:30:56.791 line:83%
You look depressed. You won't eat.

1426
01:30:56.875 --> 01:30:58.291 line:83%
-Let me go!
-Suzume!

1427
01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:00.083 line:83%
You go home, Tamaki!

1428
01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:01.958 line:83%
I never asked you to come after me!

1429
01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.708 line:83%
Do you have any idea?

1430
01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:06.041 line:83%
I was worried sick!

1431
01:31:06.125 --> 01:31:08.208 line:83%
That's exactly why I'm suffocating!

1432
01:31:17.958 --> 01:31:21.125 line:83%
I can't... take this anymore.

1433
01:31:21.958 --> 01:31:24.583 line:83%
I had to take you in.

1434
01:31:24.666 --> 01:31:27.166 line:83%
I devoted the last ten years to you.

1435
01:31:27.666 --> 01:31:29.458 line:83%
I'm such an idiot...

1436
01:31:30.625 --> 01:31:31.958 line:83%
Every day I walk on eggshells.

1437
01:31:32.416 --> 01:31:34.500 line:83%
A child who lost her mother?

1438
01:31:34.833 --> 01:31:37.791 line:83%
I could never have anyone over
because of you.

1439
01:31:37.875 --> 01:31:40.875 line:83%
And who would marry someone
who's basically got a kid?

1440
01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:44.958 line:83%
Even with my sister's money,
there's no balancing that scale.

1441
01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:48.458 line:83%
Is that...?

1442
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:51.875 line:83%
But it's not like I...

1443
01:31:51.958 --> 01:31:53.875 line:83%
Sorry it took me so long...

1444
01:31:53.958 --> 01:31:55.583 line:83%
...had a choice, either.

1445
01:31:56.083 --> 01:31:57.125 line:83%
You're my daughter...

1446
01:31:58.541 --> 01:32:01.458 line:83%
You're the one who said,
"You're my daughter"!

1447
01:32:01.666 --> 01:32:03.458 line:83%
I don't remember that.

1448
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.958 line:83%
Get out of my house.

1449
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:08.541 line:83%
Give me back my life!

1450
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:15.041 line:83%
Who... are you?

1451
01:32:16.083 --> 01:32:17.416 line:83%
Sadaijin.

1452
01:32:19.625 --> 01:32:21.041 line:83%
Sadaijin...?

1453
01:32:28.291 --> 01:32:30.416 line:83%
H-Hey, Tamaki?

1454
01:32:33.208 --> 01:32:34.916 line:83%
What happened?

1455
01:32:51.208 --> 01:32:53.041 line:83%
Are you okay?

1456
01:32:53.375 --> 01:32:54.625 line:83%
What did I...?

1457
01:32:55.208 --> 01:32:57.375 line:83%
Sorry, I have to--!

1458
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.291 line:83%
-Serizawa.
-Yeah?

1459
01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:07.041 line:83%
I think I'm losing it...

1460
01:33:08.125 --> 01:33:11.875 line:83%
Why would I say something like that?

1461
01:33:11.958 --> 01:33:15.541 line:83%
Uh... Hey, hey, hey!

1462
01:33:16.166 --> 01:33:18.041 line:83%
Are you okay?

1463
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:24.458 line:83%
Yup... Seriously big issues.

1464
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:27.750 line:83%
I took the button on my uniform...

1465
01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:29.166 line:83%
Nope.

1466
01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:31.166 line:83%
-A Valentine's day kiss!
-Not this.

1467
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:32.291 line:83%

01:33:32.375 --> 01:33:33.791 line:83%
There ya go.

1469
01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:39.208 line:83%
Please stop the fighting, both of you...

1470
01:33:39.291 --> 01:33:42.541 line:83%
I don't want you two...

1471
01:33:42.625 --> 01:33:46.000 line:83%
To fight over me

1472
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:49.291 line:83%
This car's pretty great
when it's sunny, right?

1473
01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:51.125 line:83%
Umm... Do you mind?

1474
01:33:51.416 --> 01:33:54.708 line:83%
Huh? I'm choosing the songs
that suit my audience.

1475
01:33:54.958 --> 01:33:57.625 line:83%
You appreciate the oldies, right, Suzume?

1476
01:34:00.708 --> 01:34:02.291 line:83%
Guess the rain ain't done yet...

1477
01:34:02.375 --> 01:34:03.375 line:83%
Right, newcomer?

1478
01:34:04.041 --> 01:34:06.083 line:83%
How did we pick up another stray?

1479
01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:08.125 line:83%
And a huge one, at that.

1480
01:34:08.833 --> 01:34:10.166 line:83%
Hey, a rainbow.

1481
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:12.041 line:83%
Now there's a good sign.

1482
01:34:14.791 --> 01:34:15.791 line:83%
Man.

1483
01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:18.125 line:83%
Tough crowd.

1484
01:34:20.833 --> 01:34:24.750 line:83%
Suzume, cats don't follow people
without a reason.

1485
01:34:25.041 --> 01:34:26.708 line:83%
Unlike dogs.

1486
01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:28.875 line:83%
Those black and white cats...

1487
01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:32.291 line:83%
must really want something from you.

1488
01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:34.375 line:83%
-Precisely.
-Wha--?

1489
01:34:34.708 --> 01:34:37.375 line:83%
Return everything as it was,
with human hands.

1490
01:34:40.125 --> 01:34:41.375 line:83%
It spoke!

1491
01:34:44.208 --> 01:34:47.208 line:83%
Ah... hey, hey, he--

1492
01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:49.041 line:83%
You're kidding me...

1493
01:35:00.375 --> 01:35:01.875 line:83%
Hey, it's fixed.

1494
01:35:06.208 --> 01:35:07.375 line:83%
Oh, come on!

1495
01:35:08.125 --> 01:35:09.875 line:83%
That could've ended much worse.

1496
01:35:10.291 --> 01:35:13.458 line:83%
Never mind that. Did those cats just talk?

1497
01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:16.875 line:83%
T-They totally did, didn't they?

1498
01:35:17.083 --> 01:35:18.875 line:83%
What the heck was that?
Supernatural stuff?

1499
01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:20.541 line:83%
Nah, that can't be possible.

1500
01:35:20.625 --> 01:35:22.083 line:83%
Excuse me!

1501
01:35:22.833 --> 01:35:24.166 line:83%
They won't stop.

1502
01:35:25.541 --> 01:35:26.666 line:83%
Serizawa!

1503
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:28.625 line:83%
We're about 10 km out, right?

1504
01:35:28.958 --> 01:35:31.833 line:83%
Approximately 20 km to your destination.

1505
01:35:31.916 --> 01:35:33.458 line:83%
More like 20.

1506
01:35:33.541 --> 01:35:34.750 line:83%
It's still quite a ways away.

1507
01:35:34.833 --> 01:35:36.875 line:83%
-Return to the designated route.
-I know!

1508
01:35:37.083 --> 01:35:38.375 line:83%
I'm gonna run the rest.

1509
01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:41.333 line:83%
Thank you so much, Serizawa!

1510
01:35:41.416 --> 01:35:42.666 line:83%
You too, Tamaki!

1511
01:35:52.791 --> 01:35:54.833 line:83%
I'm going too.

1512
01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:57.958 line:83%
Thanks for getting us this far.

1513
01:36:00.583 --> 01:36:03.791 line:83%
I think you might actually
make a great teacher...

1514
01:36:05.708 --> 01:36:08.375 line:83%
H-Hey, you guys...!

1515
01:36:10.333 --> 01:36:12.875 line:83%
What the heck was that all about?

1516
01:36:18.041 --> 01:36:20.833 line:83%
Man, I envy you, Souta.

1517
01:36:34.291 --> 01:36:35.458 line:83%
Tamaki?

1518
01:36:36.416 --> 01:36:37.916 line:83%
I give up.

1519
01:36:39.291 --> 01:36:43.416 line:83%
This is about you
chasing someone you love, right?

1520
01:36:44.708 --> 01:36:46.375 line:83%
Th-This isn't a love thing.

1521
01:36:50.166 --> 01:36:51.166 line:83%
Hey, Suzume...

1522
01:36:51.375 --> 01:36:53.000 line:83%
Who are these guys?

1523
01:36:53.083 --> 01:36:55.916 line:83%
-They're supposed to be gods?
-Gods?

1524
01:36:59.833 --> 01:37:03.041 line:83%
What I said, in the parking lot...

1525
01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:05.583 line:83%
Sure, I've felt that way at times...

1526
01:37:05.666 --> 01:37:08.916 line:83%
-But that's not the only thing I've felt.
-Yeah.

1527
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:12.375 line:83%
You understand it's not the only thing...

1528
01:37:13.708 --> 01:37:14.916 line:83%
Me too.

1529
01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:17.666 line:83%
I'm sorry, Tamaki.

1530
01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:22.875 line:83%
Your first time home in 12 years.

1531
01:37:35.333 --> 01:37:37.750 line:83%
I'm home, Mommy!

1532
01:37:41.666 --> 01:37:44.250 line:83%
I'm home, Mom.

1533
01:37:46.625 --> 01:37:49.666 line:83%
Look at how much she's grown, Sis.

1534
01:37:50.708 --> 01:37:54.250 line:83%
I have no idea what she's about to do.

1535
01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:03.041 line:83%
Found it.

1536
01:38:07.916 --> 01:38:13.666 line:83%
SUZUME'S IMPORTANT STUFF

1537
01:38:14.625 --> 01:38:15.750 line:83%
A diary?

1538
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:19.958 line:83%
Yeah. I don't remember exactly
what happened back then.

1539
01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:23.000 line:83%
But, I do remember
wandering through a door...

1540
01:38:27.916 --> 01:38:33.625 line:83%
MARCH 11

1541
01:38:37.666 --> 01:38:41.250 line:83%
Tsunami warning.

1542
01:38:42.708 --> 01:38:47.916 line:83%
Those near the ocean, please evacuate
to high ground immediately.

1543
01:38:49.583 --> 01:38:51.291 line:83%
-Have you seen my mommy?
-Are you alone?

1544
01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:52.958 line:83%
She was working at the hospital.

1545
01:38:53.041 --> 01:38:55.416 line:83%
-Have you seen my mommy?
-They haven't found Tsubame?

1546
01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.541 line:83%
That girl's still looking today.

1547
01:38:57.625 --> 01:38:59.000 line:83%
Do you know where my mommy is?

1548
01:38:59.083 --> 01:39:01.125 line:83%
-She's only four...
-Her mother's probably--

1549
01:39:01.208 --> 01:39:03.125 line:83%
-The poor thing.
-Have you seen my mommy...?

1550
01:39:03.208 --> 01:39:05.166 line:83%
-She's all alone.
-I'm sorry, Suzume.

1551
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.916 line:83%
My mommy...!

1552
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.416 line:83%
Sorry.

1553
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.791 line:83%
Mommy...!

1554
01:39:09.875 --> 01:39:11.916 line:83%
Where are you?

1555
01:39:15.708 --> 01:39:18.041 line:83%
It wasn't... a dream.

1556
01:39:18.916 --> 01:39:21.166 line:83%
That's right,
the moon was full that night.

1557
01:39:21.583 --> 01:39:23.958 line:83%
Right by that telephone pole.

1558
01:39:24.833 --> 01:39:25.916 line:83%
What?

1559
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.583 line:83%
You're looking for this door?

1560
01:39:27.666 --> 01:39:29.916 line:83%
Hey, Suzume!

1561
01:39:30.291 --> 01:39:33.750 line:83%
It's been 12 years!
The rubble's probably long gone!

1562
01:39:38.875 --> 01:39:39.875 line:83%
Where...?

1563
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:43.750 line:83%
Suzume.

1564
01:39:45.083 --> 01:39:46.083 line:83%
Daijin?

1565
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:51.000 line:83%
Hey, what're...?

1566
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.500 line:83%
Daijin, have you...?

1567
01:40:09.833 --> 01:40:13.500 line:83%
Have you been guiding us
to the open doors all this time?

1568
01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:15.666 line:83%
This whole time...

1569
01:40:21.583 --> 01:40:22.958 line:83%
Whoa...!

1570
01:40:23.583 --> 01:40:25.333 line:83%
Thank you so much, Daijin!

1571
01:40:27.958 --> 01:40:29.250 line:83%
Let's go, Suzume!

1572
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:32.750 line:83%
Suzume!

1573
01:40:32.958 --> 01:40:33.958 line:83%
Tamaki.

1574
01:40:34.041 --> 01:40:35.416 line:83%
I'm going!

1575
01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.000 line:83%
Going where?

1576
01:40:37.208 --> 01:40:38.500 line:83%
To see the person I love!

1577
01:40:46.041 --> 01:40:47.250 line:83%
Suzume...?

1578
01:40:59.375 --> 01:41:01.125 line:83%
The ground is on fire.

1579
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:05.250 line:83%
That's...

1580
01:41:05.791 --> 01:41:06.958 line:83%
The worm!

1581
01:41:11.791 --> 01:41:13.625 line:83%
It's going for the Gate!

1582
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:25.750 line:83%
Sadaijin?

1583
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000 line:83%
Is that...?

1584
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:44.500 line:83%
Souta?

1585
01:42:03.916 --> 01:42:05.000 line:83%
Daijin, you...!

1586
01:42:07.458 --> 01:42:09.250 line:83%
Suzume, are you okay?

1587
01:42:11.958 --> 01:42:13.500 line:83%
What is this place?

1588
01:42:14.541 --> 01:42:16.458 line:83%
This is the Ever-After?

1589
01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:19.083 line:83%
It's Souta!

1590
01:43:07.166 --> 01:43:10.166 line:83%
Souta! Souta! Souta!

1591
01:43:17.250 --> 01:43:18.416 line:83%
Suzume.

1592
01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:21.583 line:83%
If you take the Keystone,
the worm will escape.

1593
01:43:21.666 --> 01:43:23.416 line:83%
I'll become the Keystone!

1594
01:43:24.875 --> 01:43:26.250 line:83%
So please...

1595
01:43:27.291 --> 01:43:30.458 line:83%
Wake up, Souta!

1596
01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:34.791 line:83%
You...

1597
01:43:47.541 --> 01:43:48.625 line:83%
Souta!

1598
01:43:48.708 --> 01:43:51.541 line:83%
I've come this far!

1599
01:43:52.208 --> 01:43:54.125 line:83%
Please, answer me!

1600
01:43:54.958 --> 01:43:56.166 line:83%
Souta!

1601
01:43:56.250 --> 01:43:57.875 line:83%
Let me hear your voice.

1602
01:43:58.083 --> 01:43:59.500 line:83%
Souta!

1603
01:43:59.875 --> 01:44:01.375 line:83%
Souta!

1604
01:44:07.666 --> 01:44:09.291 line:83%
Hey, you...

1605
01:44:11.625 --> 01:44:13.750 line:83%
Do you know of any ruins in this area?

1606
01:44:14.291 --> 01:44:15.291 line:83%
Ruins...?

1607
01:44:17.708 --> 01:44:21.375 line:83%
-Are you not afraid to die?
-I'm not!

1608
01:44:21.458 --> 01:44:23.291 line:83%
We make a great team!

1609
01:44:23.375 --> 01:44:25.333 line:83%
I think I'm doing something
pretty important!

1610
01:44:25.625 --> 01:44:26.708 line:83%
Join us.

1611
01:44:26.958 --> 01:44:29.375 line:83%
Well, aren't you popular, Souta?

1612
01:44:29.583 --> 01:44:30.750 line:83%
Wait!

1613
01:44:31.125 --> 01:44:33.250 line:83%
-Is this...?
-Yeah.

1614
01:44:33.458 --> 01:44:36.000 line:83%
This is it...

1615
01:44:36.416 --> 01:44:38.208 line:83%
This is where I end?

1616
01:44:38.416 --> 01:44:40.708 line:83%
Souta's memories?

1617
01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:44.958 line:83%
-But, I was able to meet you.
-Souta? Souta!

1618
01:44:45.041 --> 01:44:46.250 line:83%
Hey! Souta!

1619
01:44:47.041 --> 01:44:48.375 line:83%
I finally met you!

1620
01:44:48.458 --> 01:44:49.458 line:83%
Souta!

1621
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:52.250 line:83%
I don't want to disappear. I want to live!

1622
01:44:52.458 --> 01:44:55.125 line:83%
I want to keep living! I'm afraid to die!

1623
01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.541 line:83%
I want to live. To live...

1624
01:44:57.625 --> 01:44:58.750 line:83%
To live.

1625
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.291 line:83%
More!

1626
01:45:02.291 --> 01:45:04.166 line:83%
So do I!

1627
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:06.833 line:83%
I want to live more...

1628
01:45:07.125 --> 01:45:08.375 line:83%
I want to hear your voice.

1629
01:45:08.583 --> 01:45:10.041 line:83%
I don't want to be alone.

1630
01:45:10.125 --> 01:45:12.125 line:83%
I'm afraid to die.

1631
01:45:12.208 --> 01:45:13.416 line:83%
Souta...

1632
01:45:51.166 --> 01:45:52.416 line:83%
Souta...?

1633
01:45:54.375 --> 01:45:55.916 line:83%
Suzume?

1634
01:45:58.208 --> 01:45:59.500 line:83%
What was I...?

1635
01:46:02.333 --> 01:46:03.583 line:83%
Daijin?

1636
01:46:04.541 --> 01:46:05.583 line:83%
What's wrong?

1637
01:46:06.166 --> 01:46:07.375 line:83%
You okay?

1638
01:46:09.708 --> 01:46:11.166 line:83%
I...

1639
01:46:11.541 --> 01:46:14.916 line:83%
couldn't become your cat, Suzume.

1640
01:46:15.666 --> 01:46:17.958 line:83%
Return me...

1641
01:46:18.166 --> 01:46:20.166 line:83%
...with your hands.

1642
01:46:24.833 --> 01:46:26.000 line:83%
Daijin...

1643
01:46:35.541 --> 01:46:37.208 line:83%
The second Keystone...!

1644
01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:40.333 line:83%
The worm's going to escape from the Gate!

1645
01:47:03.791 --> 01:47:05.625 line:83%
-Suzume!
-I'm fine.

1646
01:47:06.166 --> 01:47:07.166 line:83%
What now?

1647
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:09.125 line:83%
Hear their voices, and they'll hear us.

1648
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:10.791 line:83%
Follow me!

1649
01:47:20.375 --> 01:47:22.791 line:83%
O Divine Gods
who dwell beneath this land...

1650
01:47:23.916 --> 01:47:26.291 line:83%
You have long protected us
for generations...

1651
01:47:27.208 --> 01:47:30.208 line:83%
Your mountains and rivers
that we have long called our own...

1652
01:47:30.541 --> 01:47:35.041 line:83%
We respectfully return them to you!

1653
01:47:39.916 --> 01:47:41.583 line:83%
-Morning!
-Good morning!

1654
01:47:41.666 --> 01:47:43.375 line:83%
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

1655
01:47:43.458 --> 01:47:45.666 line:83%
-Bon appetit!
-Thanks for the food.

1656
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:47.833 line:83%
I'll see you later!

1657
01:47:47.916 --> 01:47:50.708 line:83%
-
See you soon.
-Come home soon.

1658
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:52.041 line:83%
-See you later!
-Come home soon.

1659
01:47:52.125 --> 01:47:53.208 line:83%
-See you soon!
-See you soon.

1660
01:47:53.291 --> 01:47:54.625 line:83%
-I'm off now.
-Take care.

1661
01:47:54.708 --> 01:47:55.875 line:83%
-See you later.
-Come home soon.

1662
01:47:55.958 --> 01:47:57.458 line:83%
-Don't be too late.
-I'll see you soon.

1663
01:47:57.541 --> 01:47:59.166 line:83%
-Take care!
-See you soon.

1664
01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:00.583 line:83%
See you later.

1665
01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:04.458 line:83%
I know that life is fleeting.

1666
01:48:04.875 --> 01:48:07.708 line:83%
We live side-by-side with death.

1667
01:48:08.708 --> 01:48:10.208 line:83%
Even then...

1668
01:48:10.541 --> 01:48:11.958 line:83%
once more...

1669
01:48:12.166 --> 01:48:13.958 line:83%
even for just one moment more

1670
01:48:14.375 --> 01:48:16.208 line:83%
we wish to live!

1671
01:48:17.208 --> 01:48:18.875 line:83%
Divine gods...!

1672
01:48:19.416 --> 01:48:21.500 line:83%
Please... Please!

1673
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:23.208 line:83%
I beg of you!

1674
01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:30.500 line:83%
It's okay.

1675
01:48:30.708 --> 01:48:31.750 line:83%
Entrust yourself.

1676
01:48:53.791 --> 01:48:55.041 line:83%
I return them to you!!

1677
01:49:42.875 --> 01:49:44.250 line:83%
Suzume...

1678
01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:04.583 line:83%
Suzume, there's someone here...

1679
01:50:05.666 --> 01:50:07.083 line:83%
A child?

1680
01:50:07.583 --> 01:50:08.583 line:83%
That girl...

1681
01:50:08.833 --> 01:50:10.833 line:83%
I... need to go!

1682
01:50:11.416 --> 01:50:12.625 line:83%
Suzume?

1683
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:23.333 line:83%
I see...

1684
01:50:24.166 --> 01:50:25.750 line:83%
That's right.

1685
01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:29.041 line:83%
I finally understand!

1686
01:50:37.833 --> 01:50:38.958 line:83%
Suzume.

1687
01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:41.583 line:83%
Suzume!

1688
01:50:47.333 --> 01:50:48.333 line:83%
Mommy?

1689
01:50:50.875 --> 01:50:52.083 line:83%
No...

1690
01:50:53.791 --> 01:50:56.000 line:83%
Do you know where my mommy is?

1691
01:50:56.083 --> 01:50:58.041 line:83%
I know she's looking for me, too!

1692
01:50:58.125 --> 01:50:59.833 line:83%
And she must be super worried!

1693
01:51:00.041 --> 01:51:02.333 line:83%
I need to go to where she is!

1694
01:51:02.416 --> 01:51:03.625 line:83%
Suzume, you're...

1695
01:51:03.708 --> 01:51:06.333 line:83%
My mommy works at the hospital,

1696
01:51:06.541 --> 01:51:08.958 line:83%
and she's really good at
cooking and wood stuff.

1697
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:10.750 line:83%
She can make anything!

1698
01:51:10.833 --> 01:51:11.958 line:83%
Suzume--!

1699
01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:13.291 line:83%
And my house is...

1700
01:51:13.625 --> 01:51:15.916 line:83%
It's gone, so...

1701
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:18.083 line:83%
Mommy...

1702
01:51:19.041 --> 01:51:22.708 line:83%
She just doesn't know
where to look for me, so...!

1703
01:51:22.791 --> 01:51:24.166 line:83%
That's enough!!

1704
01:51:26.458 --> 01:51:30.041 line:83%
Deep down, I already knew...

1705
01:51:30.625 --> 01:51:31.625 line:83%
Why?

1706
01:51:31.708 --> 01:51:35.000 line:83%
Mommy's still out there!
She's looking for me!

1707
01:51:35.083 --> 01:51:38.500 line:83%
-Suzume!
-Mommy, where are you?

1708
01:51:41.041 --> 01:51:43.291 line:83%
Mommy!!

1709
01:51:46.875 --> 01:51:48.458 line:83%
Mom...

1710
01:51:50.916 --> 01:51:52.833 line:83%
What am I supposed to do?

1711
01:52:01.625 --> 01:52:03.625 line:83%
Suzume, look.

1712
01:52:03.916 --> 01:52:05.750 line:83%
See?

1713
01:52:06.583 --> 01:52:08.291 line:83%
It's my chair.

1714
01:52:09.166 --> 01:52:10.333 line:83%
Huh?

1715
01:52:10.416 --> 01:52:12.291 line:83%
How can I say this...

1716
01:52:13.333 --> 01:52:15.125 line:83%
You see, Suzume...

1717
01:52:15.375 --> 01:52:17.625 line:83%
No matter how sad you are now,

1718
01:52:18.166 --> 01:52:21.125 line:83%
you're going to grow up.

1719
01:52:24.083 --> 01:52:26.083 line:83%
So, don't worry.

1720
01:52:26.166 --> 01:52:28.125 line:83%
The future's not that scary.

1721
01:52:29.083 --> 01:52:31.958 line:83%
You'll meet a lot of people
you care for...

1722
01:52:32.250 --> 01:52:36.208 line:83%
And you'll meet lots of people
who'll care for you, too.

1723
01:52:36.625 --> 01:52:39.458 line:83%
The night might seem endless right now

1724
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:42.000 line:83%
but one day, morning will come.

1725
01:52:42.250 --> 01:52:45.083 line:83%
You'll grow up basking in that light.

1726
01:52:45.708 --> 01:52:47.625 line:83%
I'm sure of it.

1727
01:52:47.708 --> 01:52:50.541 line:83%
It's written in the stars.

1728
01:52:52.916 --> 01:52:54.083 line:83%
Miss...

1729
01:52:54.166 --> 01:52:55.208 line:83%
who are you?

1730
01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.750 line:83%
I'm...

1731
01:53:00.416 --> 01:53:03.125 line:83%
your tomorrow.

1732
01:53:25.958 --> 01:53:27.791 line:83%
I completely forgot.

1733
01:53:29.625 --> 01:53:34.291 line:83%
I'd been given everything
that matters a long time ago.

1734
01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:39.708 line:83%
Okay, I'm off!

1735
01:53:41.666 --> 01:53:47.000 line:83%
Meaning of love, the touch

1736
01:53:47.083 --> 01:53:52.000 line:83%
The theory of relativity

1737
01:53:53.166 --> 01:53:58.750 line:83%
It all seems so unreal to me

1738
01:53:58.833 --> 01:53:59.833 line:83%
Suzume...!

1739
01:53:59.916 --> 01:54:01.416 line:83%
Hey!

1740
01:54:01.708 --> 01:54:04.166 line:83%
-Tamaki!
-Serizawa?

1741
01:54:05.166 --> 01:54:11.125 line:83%
By the time I grow up

1742
01:54:11.208 --> 01:54:16.000 line:83%
Say, did you get your money back
from Souta?

1743
01:54:16.375 --> 01:54:18.000 line:83%
Oh, that... was a lie.

1744
01:54:18.083 --> 01:54:21.791 line:83%
I actually owe Souta.

1745
01:54:21.875 --> 01:54:23.500 line:83%
Looks like he forgot.

1746
01:54:23.583 --> 01:54:25.250 line:83%
Could you keep it between us?

1747
01:54:26.791 --> 01:54:28.416 line:83%
You're hopeless.

1748
01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:33.458 line:83%
But love was not a revolution
Or frustration or catastrophe

1749
01:54:33.541 --> 01:54:35.500 line:83%
Why don't you come back with us?

1750
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:39.333 line:83%
The weight of people's feelings
is what quells the land.

1751
01:54:39.416 --> 01:54:43.250 line:83%
There are still places where that's
disappeared, causing the Gates to open.

1752
01:54:43.791 --> 01:54:46.500 line:83%
I'll close them as I return to Tokyo.

1753
01:54:47.583 --> 01:54:52.083 line:83%
The way you laughed
somehow resembled loneliness

1754
01:54:52.166 --> 01:54:54.416 line:83%
Souta! Um...

1755
01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:58.625 line:83%
The way you sang reminded me
of a glow in this morning's sky

1756
01:54:59.916 --> 01:55:02.166 line:83%
Thank you for saving me.

1757
01:55:03.083 --> 01:55:04.750 line:83%
I'll come see you. I promise.

1758
01:55:05.583 --> 01:55:10.958 line:83%
I'd love to see you laugh
With a face no one knows yet

1759
01:55:11.916 --> 01:55:17.125 line:83%
What I don't have, what I don't have
Is what you are made of

1760
01:55:17.958 --> 01:55:23.125 line:83%
You make me who I am

1761
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:29.375 line:83%
You're gonna laugh when I say this, right?

1762
01:55:29.791 --> 01:55:35.458 line:83%
I wanna see that face even

1763
01:55:35.916 --> 01:55:41.333 line:83%
What I don't have, what I don't have
Is what you are made of

1764
01:55:42.125 --> 01:55:47.000 line:83%
And who the world sings praises to

1765
01:55:59.583 --> 01:56:02.416 line:83%
If only you were here

1766
01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:05.083 line:83%
HOW TO BECOME A NURSE

1767
01:56:05.166 --> 01:56:08.791 line:83%
No matter how horrendous the words

1768
01:56:08.875 --> 01:56:14.291 line:83%
That follow may be

1769
01:56:14.375 --> 01:56:20.083 line:83%
I'll embrace those words in my arms

1770
01:56:20.333 --> 01:56:23.166 line:83%
Despair I see with you

1771
01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:26.250 line:83%
Will shine brighter

1772
01:56:26.333 --> 01:56:30.250 line:83%
Than the hope without you

1773
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:37.875 line:83%
Welcome back.

1774
01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:44.041 line:83%
The way you laughed
Somehow resembled tenderness

1775
01:56:44.541 --> 01:56:49.791 line:83%
The way you sang was like
Today's evening rain

1776
01:56:50.416 --> 01:56:56.083 line:83%
Rather than humans acting
Thousands of years from now

1777
01:56:56.458 --> 01:57:01.708 line:83%
I'd love to see you laugh with a face
No one knows yet

1778
01:57:02.958 --> 01:57:08.375 line:83%
What I don't have, what I don't have
Is what you are made of

1779
01:57:08.916 --> 01:57:14.041 line:83%
You make me who I am

1780
01:57:14.958 --> 01:57:20.208 line:83%
If I call your name out
Till my voice is gone

1781
01:57:20.916 --> 01:57:23.166 line:83%
And if that's what it takes to reach you

1782
01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:27.250 line:83%
Then I will call right now

1783
01:58:06.208 --> 01:58:11.875 line:83%
Red lines, blues lines you carry inside

1784
01:58:12.291 --> 01:58:18.041 line:83%
The twain shall meet
At the center of your heart

1785
01:58:18.625 --> 01:58:24.125 line:83%
In a voice that withstands the wind

1786
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:30.333 line:83%
I'm bringing up the words to deliver

1787
01:58:30.416 --> 01:58:36.166 line:83%
Time is a sleeper, wind the soft skin

1788
01:58:36.250 --> 01:58:39.416 line:83%
The star is a cradle

1789
01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:43.166 line:83%
People are a mirage

1790
01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:45.666 line:83%
If this tear answers

1791
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:49.333 line:83%
Your question of why I'm crying

1792
01:58:49.416 --> 01:58:55.291 line:83%
It's not as close to
The meaning of us finding each other

1793
01:58:55.375 --> 01:59:01.375 line:83%
It's the shout that this body alone
Will never be enough

1794
01:59:01.625 --> 01:59:05.500 line:83%
Found a heart that trembles

1795
01:59:05.583 --> 01:59:07.750 line:83%
Only when I touch your hand

1796
01:59:07.833 --> 01:59:13.708 line:83%
How many meanings
Must we get over to be there?

1797
01:59:13.791 --> 01:59:16.833 line:83%
Could be stupidity

1798
01:59:16.916 --> 01:59:19.916 line:83%
Could be ugliness

1799
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.875 line:83%
Beyond what's right

1800
01:59:23.958 --> 01:59:27.916 line:83%
I want to hold hands with you

1801
01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:44.083 line:83%
Precious memories I can't recall

1802
01:59:44.291 --> 01:59:50.041 line:83%
These are the thoughts
That can't be put into words

1803
01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:56.333 line:83%
Maybe, just maybe

1804
01:59:56.583 --> 02:00:02.458 line:83%
That's all this heart is made of

1805
02:00:02.833 --> 02:00:08.500 line:83%
Maybe, just maybe

1806
02:00:08.958 --> 02:00:14.791 line:83%
It still beats your heart

1807
02:00:15.166 --> 02:00:18.083 line:83%
Wanting you to "notice me"

1808
02:00:32.416 --> 02:00:34.208 line:83%
If this tear answers

1809
02:00:34.291 --> 02:00:38.541 line:83%
Your question of why I'm crying

1810
02:00:38.625 --> 02:00:44.583 line:83%
It's not as close to
The meaning of us finding each other

1811
02:00:44.666 --> 02:00:50.583 line:83%
It's the shout that this body alone
Will never be enough

1812
02:00:50.875 --> 02:00:53.541 line:83%
Found a heart that trembles

1813
02:00:53.625 --> 02:00:56.916 line:83%
Only when I touch your hand

1814
02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:03.000 line:83%
How many meanings
Must we get over to be there?

1815
02:01:03.083 --> 02:01:09.083 line:83%
Could be stupidity, could be ugliness

1816
02:01:09.166 --> 02:01:12.833 line:83%
Beyond what's right

1817
02:01:12.916 --> 02:01:16.166 line:83%
I want to live with you
