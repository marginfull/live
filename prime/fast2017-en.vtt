00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:38.343 line:83%
Well, thanks to
your botched Berlin job,

644
00:37:38.386 --> 00:37:40.867 line:83%
you all made Interpol's
top ten most wanted list.

645
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:42.564 line:83%
-Top ten.
-Mm-hmm.

646
00:37:42.608 --> 00:37:43.957 line:83%
That's all right.

647
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.785 line:83%
Well, uh... not you, Roman.

648
00:37:45.828 --> 00:37:47.352 line:83%
-What do you mean?
-You just missed the cut.

649
00:37:47.395 --> 00:37:49.092 line:83%
You're number 11, so...

650
00:37:49.136 --> 00:37:51.094 line:83%
-I... I missed?
-Yeah.

651
00:37:51.138 --> 00:37:53.532 line:83%
-ROMAN: That's impossible.
-[chuckling]

652
00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:54.837 line:83%
What number
did they come in at?

653
00:37:55.751 --> 00:37:58.450 line:83%
Six, eight, nine,

654
00:37:58.493 --> 00:38:00.147 line:83%
ten.

655
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.236 line:83%
-She's ten? That's impossible.
-Mm-hmm.

656
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.586 line:83%
-There's no way she's a ten.
-Oh, she's definitely a ten.

657
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:06.327 line:83%
[chuckles] What?

658
00:38:06.371 --> 00:38:08.329 line:83%
MR. NOBODY:
How about we focus on someone

659
00:38:08.373 --> 00:38:11.027 line:83%
who we're not gonna find
on anybody's list.

660
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:12.551 line:83%
We're awaiting
hard confirmation,

661
00:38:12.594 --> 00:38:14.727 line:83%
but I believe that's
the cyber terrorist

662
00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.294 line:83%
known as Cipher.

663
00:38:16.337 --> 00:38:17.904 line:83%
Wait, no.

664
00:38:17.947 --> 00:38:20.298 line:83%
Cipher's an organization,
not... not a person.

665
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:21.908 line:83%
Not according to our sources.

666
00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:24.040 line:83%
-What does she want?
-No one knows.

667
00:38:24.084 --> 00:38:26.652 line:83%
Cipher is like
a digital act of God.

668
00:38:26.695 --> 00:38:29.045 line:83%
They...
well, she can manipulate

669
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:31.004 line:83%
world systems from the shadows.

670
00:38:31.047 --> 00:38:32.745 line:83%
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

671
00:38:32.788 --> 00:38:35.095 line:83%
And here's the kicker--
you'll never find her linked

672
00:38:35.138 --> 00:38:36.488 line:83%
to any of it.

673
00:38:36.531 --> 00:38:37.880 line:83%
Her digital identity
is scrubbed

674
00:38:37.924 --> 00:38:39.882 line:83%
every few seconds worldwide.

675
00:38:39.926 --> 00:38:41.144 line:83%
So, basically,
she's the bogeyman.

676
00:38:41.188 --> 00:38:42.624 line:83%
Damn, she's...

677
00:38:42.668 --> 00:38:44.452 line:83%
one of the hottest bogeymans
I've ever seen.

678
00:38:44.496 --> 00:38:47.281 line:83%
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

679
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.327 line:83%
-[Roman chuckles]
-[kicks chair]

680
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:50.850 line:83%
-What are you, 12?
-That was my shin, mother...

681
00:38:50.893 --> 00:38:52.417 line:83%
Let's just say,

682
00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.245 line:83%
people are scared
of the hacker group Anonymous.

683
00:38:55.289 --> 00:38:56.856 line:83%
But even Anonymous
won't mess with her.

684
00:38:56.899 --> 00:38:59.641 line:83%
What the hell does any of this
have to do with us?

685
00:38:59.685 --> 00:39:01.687 line:83%
Probably nothing, Letty,
but I do find it interesting

686
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.776 line:83%
that, apparently,
for some reason,

687
00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:06.300 line:83%
she's now working
with this guy.

688
00:39:20.445 --> 00:39:22.708 line:83%
-[sighs]
-He's already delivered

689
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:25.145 line:83%
a fully operational EMP
into her hands.

690
00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:27.147 line:83%
Detonate that, they can turn

691
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.062 line:83%
any city in the world
into a war zone.

692
00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:31.630 line:83%
So, then, what is it
you're suggesting we do?

693
00:39:31.673 --> 00:39:33.327 line:83%
MR. NOBODY:
Maybe we find Dom, huh?

694
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:34.676 line:83%
Well, first, let's catch him

695
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.722 line:83%
and then figure out
why he's turned.

696
00:39:36.765 --> 00:39:39.246 line:83%
So, y'all want us to track Dom.

697
00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:42.292 line:83%
Yeah, I know, Roman,
it's kind of a big job.

698
00:39:42.336 --> 00:39:44.251 line:83%
It's impossible.

699
00:39:44.294 --> 00:39:47.950 line:83%
Which is why I'm bringing in
an extra pair of hands.

700
00:39:47.994 --> 00:39:49.430 line:83%
[beep, buzzing]

701
00:39:54.043 --> 00:39:56.742 line:83%
Ah, my day just got
a whole hell of a lot better.

702
00:39:56.785 --> 00:39:58.178 line:83%
Mr. Nobody, you want to tell me

703
00:39:58.221 --> 00:40:00.180 line:83%
why you just put me
in a room with this

704
00:40:00.223 --> 00:40:02.922 line:83%
tea and crumpets eating,
criminal sumbitch?

705
00:40:02.965 --> 00:40:04.750 line:83%
What a big mouth
on a small head,

706
00:40:04.793 --> 00:40:07.405 line:83%
coming from prisoner 6753.

707
00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:09.494 line:83%
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

708
00:40:09.537 --> 00:40:11.800 line:83%
We are not teaming up
with this guy.

709
00:40:11.844 --> 00:40:14.368 line:83%
Let's get one thing clear:
I ain't on your team.

710
00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:15.761 line:83%
I don't care about you,

711
00:40:15.804 --> 00:40:18.198 line:83%
your crew
or your little family.

712
00:40:18.241 --> 00:40:20.156 line:83%
-I'm here for Cipher.
-HOBBS: What you gonna do,

713
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.723 line:83%
apply for a job?
Head asshole?

714
00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:23.290 line:83%
You know,
I think that tight T-shirt's

715
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:24.770 line:83%
cutting off the circulation
to your brain.

716
00:40:24.813 --> 00:40:27.076 line:83%
You should get a bigger size.

717
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.817 line:83%
Cipher came to me first.

718
00:40:28.861 --> 00:40:30.471 line:83%
Wanted me to steal Nightshade
for her.

719
00:40:30.515 --> 00:40:32.212 line:83%
When I said no,
she went after my brother.

720
00:40:32.255 --> 00:40:33.605 line:83%
Ah, yes, brother Owen.

721
00:40:33.648 --> 00:40:35.737 line:83%
Who could forget him, huh?

722
00:40:35.781 --> 00:40:38.044 line:83%
Former hell-raiser
and current guest

723
00:40:38.087 --> 00:40:40.960 line:83%
at a nasty little
black-site prison.

724
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:42.527 line:83%
Cipher corrupted him
and left him for dead.

725
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.398 line:83%
So, if I get a shot
to take her down,

726
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:45.878 line:83%
believe me, Flex,
I'm taking it.

727
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:47.401 line:83%
You're taking my boot
right up your ass

728
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.011 line:83%
-is what you're taking.
-Guys, guys, guys, guys.

729
00:40:49.055 --> 00:40:50.796 line:83%
The fastest way to find Cipher
is through Toretto.

730
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:52.450 line:83%
Now, aside from myself,
there's only

731
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:54.234 line:83%
two men in the world
that have ever managed

732
00:40:54.277 --> 00:40:55.757 line:83%
to actually track him down
with any success.

733
00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:57.237 line:83%
And guess what-- they're both

734
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.804 line:83%
standing in front of me
right now.

735
00:40:58.847 --> 00:41:02.721 line:83%
So, like it or not, you two
are gonna work together.

736
00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:03.939 line:83%
You got that?

737
00:41:06.028 --> 00:41:08.030 line:83%
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

738
00:41:09.379 --> 00:41:11.164 line:83%
Am I the only one seeing this?

739
00:41:11.207 --> 00:41:12.513 line:83%
Oh, this ought to be good.

740
00:41:12.557 --> 00:41:14.254 line:83%
[stammers]

741
00:41:15.777 --> 00:41:17.431 line:83%
Use God's Eye.

742
00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:20.478 line:83%
We put our lives on the line,
running around the world

743
00:41:20.521 --> 00:41:22.175 line:83%
trying to figure
this thing out.

744
00:41:22.218 --> 00:41:24.003 line:83%
It can find anybody, right?

745
00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:26.266 line:83%
Let's use it to find Dom.

746
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:29.878 line:83%
Roman, that is a great idea.

747
00:41:29.922 --> 00:41:32.925 line:83%
Did you hear that?
"Great idea"?

748
00:41:32.968 --> 00:41:34.709 line:83%
No, no, no, no, no,
don't tune it out, huh?

749
00:41:34.753 --> 00:41:36.798 line:83%
Mr. Nobody,
let's fire it up, huh?

750
00:41:48.027 --> 00:41:49.855 line:83%
-TEJ: Got him. He's in London.
-[chuckles]

751
00:41:51.683 --> 00:41:53.075 line:83%
Yeah.

[computer beeping]

753
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:59.255 line:83%
RAMSEY: Wait. We've got
a second match in Hong Kong.

754
00:41:59.299 --> 00:42:01.344 line:83%
ROMAN:
Beijing and Seoul.

755
00:42:01.388 --> 00:42:03.346 line:83%
TEJ:
And Tokyo.

756
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.000 line:83%
[Ramsey sighs]

757
00:42:05.044 --> 00:42:06.828 line:83%
RAMSEY: And just about
every other major city

758
00:42:06.872 --> 00:42:09.135 line:83%
-on the planet.
-MR. NOBODY: And so...

759
00:42:09.178 --> 00:42:11.006 line:83%
God's Eye
was where we started.

760
00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.747 line:83%
But Cipher's already created

761
00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:14.662 line:83%
an evasion that masks
their location

762
00:42:14.706 --> 00:42:17.230 line:83%
by pinging random spots
all over the globe,

763
00:42:17.273 --> 00:42:20.059 line:83%
but it was
a good thought, Roman.

764
00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:21.974 line:83%
So, she's made
my program obsolete.

765
00:42:22.017 --> 00:42:24.716 line:83%
And that, Ramsey,
is why you're here.

766
00:42:24.759 --> 00:42:27.545 line:83%
See, simple solutions aren't
gonna cut it here, slick.

767
00:42:28.981 --> 00:42:30.896 line:83%
Why you look at me
when you say that?

768
00:42:30.939 --> 00:42:32.462 line:83%
TEJ:
Wait a second.

769
00:42:32.506 --> 00:42:34.900 line:83%
Wait, wait. Simple solutions
might just cut it.

770
00:42:34.943 --> 00:42:36.379 line:83%
You see, in order for God's Eye

771
00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:38.120 line:83%
to give off
all these false pings,

772
00:42:38.164 --> 00:42:40.427 line:83%
means they have to be
using a FLEA relay.

773
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:41.907 line:83%
Watch these two.

774
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.735 line:83%
Which means it has a decaying
sync randomizer.

775
00:42:43.778 --> 00:42:45.258 line:83%
Which we can reverse...

776
00:42:45.301 --> 00:42:46.912 line:83%
And track it back
to the originating source

777
00:42:46.955 --> 00:42:49.305 line:83%
and find Dom's true location.

778

they got skills.

00:42:52.526 --> 00:42:54.789 line:83%
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.

781
00:42:54.833 --> 00:42:56.269 line:83%
-Remember in there?
-MR. NOBODY: All right.

782
00:42:56.312 --> 00:42:57.270 line:83%
Let's try this.

783
00:43:07.193 --> 00:43:08.803 line:83%
It's working.

784
00:43:08.847 --> 00:43:10.283 line:83%
HOBBS: Time you want
to check your manual

785
00:43:10.326 --> 00:43:12.851 line:83%
and start organizing

786
00:43:12.894 --> 00:43:14.635 line:83%
Let's get a hold
of our international assets...

He's still green.

788

Yeah, like fresh baby shit.

Soon as we have Toretto's
location, I want to mobilize.

-Get away from me.

00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:31.478 line:83%
All right,
they're not in China.

794
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.698 line:83%
Or Russia.

1427
