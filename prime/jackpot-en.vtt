00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:41.916 line:80%
How am I feeling?

1401
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.208 line:80%
Like I'm about to put some lucky
therapist's kids through college.

1402
00:57:45.291 --> 00:57:46.583 line:80%
How?

1403
00:57:48.125 --> 00:57:50.458 line:80%
Because I'm gonna need
a lot of therapy after this.

1404
00:57:50.541 --> 00:57:51.750 line:80%
Oh, I got it in my head

1405
00:57:51.833 --> 00:57:54.958 line:80%
that you were gonna start
some scholarship fund or something.

1406
00:57:55.041 --> 00:57:57.333 line:80%
-Oh.
-[snickers]

1407
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:02.125 line:80%
How are you feeling?

1408
00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:03.708 line:80%
Oh, don't worry about me.

1409
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:05.875 line:80%
I was severely traumatized
long before today.

1410
00:58:05.958 --> 00:58:07.750 line:80%
Cool brag, weirdo.

1411
00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:10.250 line:80%
[laughs quietly]

1412
00:58:10.333 --> 00:58:11.958 line:80%
What happens now?

1413
00:58:12.041 --> 00:58:14.250 line:80%
We'll debrief you in Beverly Hills.

1414
00:58:14.333 --> 00:58:16.166 line:80%
Don't worry, you're safe.

1415
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:17.708 line:80%
Actually safe.

1416
00:58:17.791 --> 00:58:19.750 line:80%
Yeah, cool brag.

1417
00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:21.208 line:80%
Weirdo.

1418
00:58:22.333 --> 00:58:25.666 line:80%
I couldn't think of anything,
so I used yours 'cause I thought...

1419
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:28.083 line:80%
-it got me, so I wanted
to get him with it.
-No, that-that was okay.

1420
00:58:28.166 --> 00:58:31.166 line:80%
That was a good use.
I think it... I think it worked.

1421
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.125 line:80%
-We'll work on it.
-Okay.

1422
00:58:33.208 --> 00:58:35.208 line:80%
-[intriguing music playing]
-[gate alarm beeping]

1423
00:58:42.083 --> 00:58:43.375 line:80%
[Ash] We're here.

1424
00:58:43.458 --> 00:58:44.708 line:80%
[Noel] You guys really upgraded the place.

1425
00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:46.041 line:80%
This must've cost a fortune.

1426
00:58:46.125 --> 00:58:48.000 line:80%
You saved that many jackpots?

1427
00:58:48.083 --> 00:58:51.250 line:80%
We're the best,
and we only want the best for our clients.

1428
00:58:58.291 --> 00:59:01.041 line:80%
I thought you said guns were illegal.

1429
00:59:01.125 --> 00:59:03.250 line:80%
We can use rubber bullets to incapacitate.

1430
00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:05.625 line:80%
But kills have to be close quarters.

1431
00:59:07.375 --> 00:59:09.250 line:80%
Minimizes collateral damage.

1432
00:59:10.833 --> 00:59:14.708 line:80%
The, uh, creepy guy vibes aside,
these guys are the real deal.

1433
00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:16.041 line:80%
I mean, look at this place.

1434
00:59:16.125 --> 00:59:17.875 line:80%
These guys could control Jurassic Park
from here.

1435
00:59:17.958 --> 00:59:19.750 line:80%
Except this time
the dinosaurs wouldn't get out.

1436
00:59:19.833 --> 00:59:21.416 line:80%
[chuckling]

1437
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.041 line:80%
Katie Kim, welcome to LPA.

1438
00:59:24.125 --> 00:59:26.250 line:80%
I'm Louis. I'm a huge fan.

1439
00:59:26.333 --> 00:59:28.375 line:80%
Of
Jurassic Park?
I feel like a lot of people are.

1440
00:59:28.458 --> 00:59:29.916 line:80%
That's why they make hundreds
of those movies.

1441
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.375 line:80%
No, are you kidding me? Of-of you.

1442
00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:35.375 line:80%
I mean, most people don't last
15 minutes without representation.

1443
00:59:35.458 --> 00:59:38.750 line:80%
You've already made it several hours,
pretty much completely alone.

1444
00:59:38.833 --> 00:59:41.333 line:80%
That makes me so proud to say
as an Asian man.

1445
00:59:41.416 --> 00:59:43.750 line:80%
-Well, I wasn't alone.
-Of course not.

1446
00:59:43.833 --> 00:59:46.416 line:80%
You had all of our ancestors
looking out for you.

1447
00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.583 line:80%
No, I was with him.

1448
00:59:48.666 --> 00:59:50.041 line:80%
Oh, you meant Noel. [laughing]

1449
00:59:50.125 --> 00:59:51.458 line:80%
Okay.

1450
00:59:51.541 --> 00:59:54.208 line:80%
Honestly, Noel was lucky the wind
was blowing in his direction today.

1451
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:56.250 line:80%
I mean, signing a rollover jackpot
as important as you,

1452
00:59:56.333 --> 01:00:00.000 line:80%
that's not a job for--
no offense, Noel-- but a hobbyist.

1453
01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:03.583 line:80%
Luckily, he realized that
and called us before it was too late.

1454
01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:07.250 line:80%
Listen, I just really want to get
to the Grapevine and finish this day.

1455
01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.625 line:80%
Totally hear you, totally hear you.

1456
01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:11.333 line:80%
But...

1457
01:00:11.416 --> 01:00:14.083 line:80%
we are the biggest lottery
protection agency in the city.

1458
01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:17.500 line:80%
Your life is about to change,
if you let us change it for you.

1459
01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:19.625 line:80%
Hey, that reminds me. Um...

1460
01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:23.083 line:80%
Please accept a little welcome gift,
on our behalf.

1461
01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:25.666 line:80%
It's an official LPA phone--
so sorry you lost yours in the strike.

1462
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:28.250 line:80%
Noel, use an Apple Store
across the street.

1463
01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:30.583 line:80%
I'm sure they got some cheap models
left in stock.

1464
01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:33.708 line:80%
Come on, I'll show you around.

1465
01:00:33.791 --> 01:00:36.375 line:80%
More of a Motorola guy, but fuck yourself.

1466
01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:39.750 line:80%
[intriguing music playing]

1467
01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:41.333 line:80%
[P.A. chimes]

1468
01:00:41.416 --> 01:00:44.250 line:80%
[woman over P.A.]
Attention.
Lottery ends in four hours.

1469
01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:47.083 line:80%
Oh. This is where you keep
all the good-looking people.

1470
01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:50.541 line:80%
-[Louis] Sure is.
-Not all the good-looking people.

1471
01:00:50.625 --> 01:00:52.375 line:80%
You're good-looking.

1472
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.375 line:80%
Pity shoulder pat-- that's brutal.

1473
01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:58.125 line:80%
[Louis] That is our wall of winners.

1474
01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:02.416 line:80%
In a few hours, your face--
[clicks tongue]-- is gonna go right there.

1475
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.291 line:80%
It's been a while since the last one, huh?

1476
01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:06.375 line:80%
[Louis] Yeah. Well, you know,

1477
01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:09.208 line:80%
half the jackpots these days
are so desperate,

1478
01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:11.916 line:80%
they decide to risk keeping the commission
rather than letting us save their lives.

1479
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.333 line:80%
Now, we charge 30% here,

1480
01:01:13.416 --> 01:01:15.291 line:80%
which sounds like a lot, I know,

1481
01:01:15.375 --> 01:01:18.125 line:80%
but, uh, we also have
the highest rate of survival in the city.

1482
01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.458 line:80%
[woman] Sir?

1483
01:01:19.541 --> 01:01:21.208 line:80%
Thank you.

1484
01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:23.083 line:80%
So, what do you say, Katie Kim?

1485
01:01:23.166 --> 01:01:26.041 line:80%
Can we officially make you a billionaire?

1486
01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:28.916 line:80%
Without that Phone Strike,
we'd be dead meat.

1487
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.291 line:80%
So, they do deliver.

1488
01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.541 line:80%
What percentage does Noel get?

1489
01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:37.166 line:80%
Sorry, Noel?

1490
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:40.458 line:80%
Yeah. He saved me way before
you guys entered the picture.

1491
01:01:40.541 --> 01:01:42.083 line:80%
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

1492
01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:46.166 line:80%
We would be happy to give Noel
five percent of our commission.

1493
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.541 line:80%
Five percent?

1494
01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:50.416 line:80%
Wow, waiters must love you.

1495
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.458 line:80%
-Fifty percent.
-Katie, that's--

1496
01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:53.750 line:80%
Fifty percent.

1497
01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:56.583 line:80%
Uh... okay.

1498
01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:58.625 line:80%
Tell you what.

1499
01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:02.125 line:80%
I think it's only fair that Noel receive
the same commission that we charge.

1500
01:02:02.208 --> 01:02:04.166 line:80%
-Thirty percent.
-Say-say what?

1501
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.708 line:80%
Say 30%.

1502
01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:07.166 line:80%
How's that sound?

1503
01:02:11.958 --> 01:02:14.625 line:80%
[chirping, beeps]

1504
01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:16.666 line:80%
Excellent. Wonderful.

1505
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:18.500 line:80%
You made the right choice today, Katie.

1506
01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:21.708 line:80%
I know that every single agent,
myself especially,

1507
01:02:21.791 --> 01:02:23.625 line:80%
we're all here to kick butt
on your behalf.

1508
01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:29.208 line:80%
Really? Because you look more ready
to challenge Celine Dion to a sing-off.

1509
01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:31.916 line:80%
Well, I did always have trouble
hitting the high note in "All By Myself,"

1510
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.083 line:80%
but, uh, I reckon I could blow
her face off pretty good with these.

1511
01:02:36.166 --> 01:02:37.291 line:80%
Slimline grenades.

1512
01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:39.750 line:80%
You're safe with us. I guarantee it.

1513
01:02:40.833 --> 01:02:42.458 line:80%
Come on.

1514
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:43.625 line:80%
You can come, too, Noel.

1515
01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:46.750 line:80%
-[P.A. chimes]
-[indistinct announcement over P.A.]

1516
01:02:46.833 --> 01:02:48.750 line:80%
Come on, Noel. What are you doing?

1517
01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.750 line:80%
Your fans are very smart, Katie.

1518
01:02:52.833 --> 01:02:54.583 line:80%
They don't wait for your location
to be posted.

1519
01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:56.208 line:80%
They just follow the drone.

1520
01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:59.666 line:80%
I feel like you might want to use
a different word than "fans."

1521
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.500 line:80%
[Louis] Well, they're rabid,
I'll tell you that.

1522
01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:03.583 line:80%
And they want to get me almost as bad
as they want to get you

1523
01:03:03.666 --> 01:03:05.083 line:80%
since I'm standing in the way
of their money.

1524
01:03:05.166 --> 01:03:08.083 line:80%
We can hold them off here for a while
but, uh, not indefinitely.

1525
01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:09.291 line:80%
[Noel] What?

1526
01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:12.166 line:80%
What, you build a bunker like this
and you skimp on the windows?

1527
01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:15.791 line:80%
Well, when the pot is $3.6 billion, Noel,
we don't take any chances.

1528
01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.250 line:80%
That's why we're the best.

1529
01:03:17.333 --> 01:03:18.375 line:80%
Makes sense.

1530
01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:19.708 line:80%
All right, so here's the deal.

1531
01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:21.875 line:80%
First, we'll dispatch a fleet
of autonomous decoy vehicles.

1532
01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:24.083 line:80%
Most of your fans will follow those,
thinking you're in one of them.

1533
01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:26.083 line:80%
Once they do, we'll exfiltrate you
in a different vehicle

1534
01:03:26.166 --> 01:03:28.000 line:80%
to a hidden underground fortress,

1535
01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:30.250 line:80%
and, uh, from there,
you're home free, Richie Rich.

1536
01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.041 line:80%
Isabella's going to take care of you.

1537
01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:35.375 line:80%
Miss Kim, follow me.

1538
01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:38.000 line:80%
Oh, and, uh, Isabella,
why don't we make sure

1539
01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:41.625 line:80%
that Miss Kim gets an outfit
that's, uh, not visible from space.

1540
01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:43.500 line:80%
I-I don't normally dress like this.

1541
01:03:43.583 --> 01:03:45.458 line:80%
We probably shop at the same store.

1542
01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:48.875 line:80%
My comfort zone is dressing
like a husky tween.

1543
01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.208 line:80%
-[stammering] Okay.
-[P.A. chimes]

1544
01:03:50.291 --> 01:03:52.041 line:80%
[woman over P.A.]
Agent Ash,
call on line three.

1545
01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:54.750 line:80%
Louis, uh, I just wanted to say
it was really decent

1546
01:03:54.833 --> 01:03:56.166 line:80%
what you did back there, cutting me in.

1547
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.458 line:80%
You did not have to do that.

1548
01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:58.708 line:80%
I know.

1549
01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:00.583 line:80%
Thank you.

1550
01:04:00.666 --> 01:04:02.875 line:80%
I, uh, hope the past
is just water under the bridge.

1551
01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:05.666 line:80%
Hey, we're cool.

1552
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.458 line:80%
All right?

1553
01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:09.083 line:80%
It's good to see you.

1554
01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:11.791 line:80%
Would you do me a favor,
just fix yourself up a little bit.

1555
01:04:11.875 --> 01:04:15.750 line:80%
You look like Wreck-It Ralph after
a 14-hour cocaine bender. Geez.

1556
01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:18.208 line:80%
You look like...

1557
01:04:18.291 --> 01:04:19.916 line:80%
Fuck.

1558
01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:24.416 line:80%
Wow, this is how
the other half lives, huh?

1559
01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.208 line:80%
My doctor's office is in a strip mall
next to an El Pollo Loco.

1560
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:28.708 line:80%
Ow! Oh. [chuckles]

1561
01:04:28.791 --> 01:04:31.333 line:80%
I hope my health care pays for this.
Just kidding, I don't have any.

1562
01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:34.541 line:80%
-Um, can I ask you something?
-Shoot.

1563
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.958 line:80%
You been doing this a long time?

1564
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.250 line:80%
A while.

1565
01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:41.416 line:80%
You save a lot of people?

1566
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.500 line:80%
A few.

1567
01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:45.375 line:80%
Then what do you spend your money on?

1568
01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:49.583 line:80%
Because, um, well, I can tell that you-you
might not be spending it on yourself.

1569
01:04:49.666 --> 01:04:50.916 line:80%
Excuse me?

1570
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.875 line:80%
For starters, you dress like a gym teacher
at a funeral.

1571
01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:55.041 line:80%
I was voted Best Dressed my senior year.

1572
01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.666 line:80%
Ah, so you were homeschooled?

1573
01:04:57.958 --> 01:05:00.083 line:80%
-And you clearly cut your own hair.
-My grandmother cuts my hair.

1574
01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:02.708 line:80%
I'm just saying, it's...
it's dangerous work.

1575
01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:07.791 line:80%
And anyone with their head screwed on
right would make their money and stop.

1576
01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:10.958 line:80%
So, uh, well, why haven't you?

1577
01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.166 line:80%
Thanks.

1578
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.750 line:80%
That's a fair question.

1579
01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:17.125 line:80%
Um...

1580
01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:19.500 line:80%
I used to be a mercenary, private sector.

1581
01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:20.833 line:80%
-With Louis.
-[door closes]

1582
01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:25.500 line:80%
Our unit got sent all around the world
to do bad things to bad people.

1583
01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:27.916 line:80%
And we weren't paid to ask any questions.

1584
01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:30.541 line:80%
One day, I did,

1585
01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:33.500 line:80%
and I found out some of those people
weren't as bad as they say.

1586
01:05:34.666 --> 01:05:37.250 line:80%
I tried to convince Louis.
He wouldn't listen.

1587
01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.583 line:80%
So I just bailed.

1588
01:05:38.666 --> 01:05:40.708 line:80%
Right there in the middle of a job, but...

1589
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.666 line:80%
...because I wasn't there,
the mission went sideways,

1590
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.375 line:80%
and, uh, my unit...

1591
01:05:48.958 --> 01:05:51.458 line:80%
Louis and I are the only survivors.

1592
01:05:53.666 --> 01:05:57.041 line:80%
So the money I make, my ten percent,
uh, goes to their families

1593
01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.000 line:80%
and the families of the good people
we hurt.

1594
01:06:00.083 --> 01:06:01.166 line:80%
Oh.

1595
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.875 line:80%
Wow. That's heavy.

1596
01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:06.041 line:80%
You know what?

1597
01:06:06.125 --> 01:06:07.750 line:80%
Because of what you negotiated with Louis,

1598
01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:10.166 line:80%
they are gonna be getting
a whole lot more now, so...

1599
01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:13.458 line:80%
...thank you.

1600
01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:18.875 line:80%
M... my dad was my manager.

1601
01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:21.375 line:80%
He had me working my ass off
since I was eight years old.

1602
01:06:21.458 --> 01:06:23.666 line:80%
And then, on my 18th birthday,

1603
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:28.500 line:80%
I tell him I want to take charge
of my own time

1604
01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:30.583 line:80%
and my own money.

1605
01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:34.333 line:80%
And he said...

1606
01:06:34.416 --> 01:06:38.125 line:80%
"Okay, sweetheart.
I'll take care of you. Trust me."

1607
01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:41.625 line:80%
Then the next morning, he's gone.

1608
01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:44.625 line:80%
He took every cent I ever earned,

1609
01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:46.666 line:80%
left me and my mom high and dry.

1610
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:48.916 line:80%
Then my mom got sick

1611
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.291 line:80%
and I had to quit to take care of her
because no one else would.

1612
01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:55.583 line:80%
She finally died a month ago.

1613
01:06:56.875 --> 01:07:00.791 line:80%
Left me with $600
and a bus ticket to L.A., so...

1614
01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:03.375 line:80%
here I am now...

1615
01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:04.625 line:80%
trying to start over.

1616
01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:06.125 line:80%
Katie, I am--

1617
01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:09.666 line:80%
I-I'm not trying to compete
with your story. Um...

1618
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:13.458 line:80%
I'm just explaining that my own father

1619
01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:18.291 line:80%
didn't hesitate for a second to choose
money over me and my mom, so...

1620
01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:20.083 line:80%
how was I supposed to trust you?

1621
01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:24.041 line:80%
Sure.

1622
01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:27.208 line:80%
But I do trust you, Noel.

1623
01:07:27.291 --> 01:07:29.750 line:80%
For some weird reason, I-I do.

1624
01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:33.666 line:80%
I think it's because you look
like a bulldog

1625
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:36.000 line:80%
-that, like, a witch cast a spell on...
-[door closing]

1626
01:07:36.083 --> 01:07:38.166 line:80%
...and turned into a human,
like, against his will.

1627
01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:39.833 line:80%
-You ever get that?
-[footsteps approaching]

1628
01:07:39.916 --> 01:07:41.000 line:80%
Yes.

1629
01:07:43.708 --> 01:07:46.625 line:80%
Miss Kim, please put your face right here.

1630
01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:48.916 line:80%
This is a prosthetics machine.

1631
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.750 line:80%
Go ahead and pick any face you'd like.

1632
01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:52.250 line:80%
Oh, cool.

1633
01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:55.333 line:80%
It's just an extra added layer
of protection for when you're in transit.

1634
01:07:55.416 --> 01:07:57.541 line:80%
If people can't recognize you,
you're a lot safer.

1635
01:07:57.625 --> 01:07:59.708 line:80%
[Katie] Oh, my God.
There are so many different faces.

1636
01:07:59.791 --> 01:08:01.083 line:80%
[departing footsteps]

1637
01:08:01.166 --> 01:08:02.583 line:80%
Cool, cool.

1638
01:08:02.666 --> 01:08:04.166 line:80%
Oh, I like this one.

1639
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.083 line:80%
[beeps]

1640
01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:07.666 line:80%
[whirring]

1641
01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:12.166 line:80%
-[clicks]
-[laughs] Oh. Oh.

1642
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.041 line:80%
This is, it's weird in here.

1643
01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:16.083 line:80%
It's crazy.

1644
01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:18.541 line:80%
Um, hey, Noel?

1645
01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.500 line:80%
-Yeah?
-Why'd you get so upset earlier

1646
01:08:20.583 --> 01:08:22.958 line:80%
when you were asking Louis
for help in the panic room?

1647
01:08:23.041 --> 01:08:25.041 line:80%
Is it 'cause you didn't want to lose out
on commission?

1648
01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:26.208 line:80%
[Noel] Oh, come on, no.

1649
01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:28.208 line:80%
There's a lot of bad blood between us
after what happened, okay?

1650
01:08:28.291 --> 01:08:30.833 line:80%
I hated that I needed him.

1651
01:08:30.916 --> 01:08:33.458 line:80%
But he seems to be past it, so...

1652
01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:35.958 line:80%
I will suck it up as long as it helps you.

1653
01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:37.958 line:80%
[Katie] He's definitely
still a dick to you.

1654
01:08:38.041 --> 01:08:39.416 line:80%
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1655
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.958 line:80%
That's Louis.

1656
01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:44.333 line:80%
That's why I was so surprised
when he caved in on the 30%.

1657
01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:47.583 line:80%
Not like the old Louis, but I mean,
people change, right?

1658
01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:50.208 line:80%
[Katie] Oh, yeah,
I've found that not to be the case.

1659
01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:52.208 line:80%
I mean, do you really trust him?

1660
01:08:52.291 --> 01:08:55.083 line:80%
Our lives are literally
in his hands right now.

1661
01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:56.166 line:80%
[bell dings]

1662
01:08:58.083 --> 01:09:00.375 line:80%
Hey, girl, hey.

1663
01:09:00.458 --> 01:09:02.333 line:80%
What? Too sexy?

1664
01:09:03.416 --> 01:09:04.958 line:80%
Let's go pee standing up

1665
01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:07.333 line:80%
and make more money
than our female counterparts, am I right?

1666
01:09:08.833 --> 01:09:10.541 line:80%
What's wrong?

1667
01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:14.041 line:80%
This, this equipment, staff, the facility.

1668
01:09:14.125 --> 01:09:15.791 line:80%
Those are huge expenses.

1669
01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:18.083 line:80%
And moving out of this bunker
doesn't make sense.

1670
01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:20.500 line:80%
You saw how long it's been
since they had a jackpot.

1671
01:09:20.583 --> 01:09:22.791 line:80%
And the ones they had before, that weren't
that big, not big enough for all this.

1672
01:09:22.875 --> 01:09:24.083 line:80%
So you think it's a setup?

1673
01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:26.083 line:80%
-I don't know.
-[Louis] What don't you know, Noel?

1674
01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:28.416 line:80%
Um... why I just farted.

1675
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.916 line:80%
It's probably the muscle relaxants.

1676
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.666 line:80%
Nothing loosens a sphincter faster.

1677
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.166 line:80%
And since I know what Noel usually eats,

1678
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.750 line:80%
I'd say it's best we get the hell
out of here ASAP.

1679
01:09:35.833 --> 01:09:37.083 line:80%
Shall we?

1680
01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:38.791 line:80%
Yes.

1681
01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:41.416 line:80%
As long as you're ready, Noel.

1682
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.875 line:80%
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, we should go.

1683
01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:46.000 line:80%
That's a strong look, by the way, Katie.

1684
01:09:46.083 --> 01:09:47.791 line:80%
Not many women could pull off
a goatee like that.

1685
01:09:47.875 --> 01:09:49.250 line:80%
-[Katie] Oh.
-Dig it.

1686
01:09:49.333 --> 01:09:51.500 line:80%
Thank you.

1687
01:09:51.583 --> 01:09:54.833 line:80%
[intense music playing]

1688
01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:58.250 line:80%
Hey, Louis, uh, you sure it's a good idea
to move her out of here?

1689
01:09:58.333 --> 01:09:59.791 line:80%
I mean, this place seems really secure.

1690
01:09:59.875 --> 01:10:02.541 line:80%
Oh, if people know where she is,
then it's not secure, is it, Noel?

1691
01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:04.291 line:80%
You're not questioning my expertise,
are you?

1692
01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.958 line:80%
No. No, Louis, you know me.
Always looking for a way out.

1693
01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:08.500 line:80%
-[P.A. chimes]
-Ain't that the truth.

1694
01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:10.875 line:80%
[woman over P.A.]
Attention.
Lottery ends in three hours.

1695
01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:12.166 line:80%
Okay, we're in trouble, aren't we?

1696
01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.583 line:80%
Yes, we are.

1697
01:10:13.666 --> 01:10:15.333 line:80%
I could never figure out
why more than half the players

1698
01:10:15.416 --> 01:10:17.375 line:80%
that killed jackpots this year
requested anonymity.

1699
01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:19.666 line:80%
Now it makes sense.

1700
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.375 line:80%
I think that Louis
has been murdering his clients.

1701
01:10:22.458 --> 01:10:23.875 line:80%
