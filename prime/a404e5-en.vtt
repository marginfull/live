00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.000 line:82%
After over 70 years of existence,

2
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:32.100 line:82%
the Soviet Union dissolved
as a sovereign state.

3
00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.700 line:82%
As most countries took up
the system of capitalism…

4
00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:40.800 line:82%
The world has entered
an age of great change.

5
00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:49.166 line:82%
The culprit broke into a neighbor's house
and stole valuables.

6
00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:53.200 line:82%
A threat to poison ice cream
unless the culprit got 50 million won…

7
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.600 line:82%
A young life was sacrificed
due to gambling debt.

8
00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.667 line:82%
The culprit has given up on humanity.

9
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.734 line:82%
It's the result of the capitalistic jungle

10
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.166 line:82%
that left the greed for capital unchecked.

11
00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:54.667 line:82%
Today, your style is…

12
00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:55.734 line:82%
I'm Shim Shin.

Oh, my God.

15
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.200 line:82%
You look so handsome.

16
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.533 line:82%
Are you a drunkard?

17
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.133 line:82%
You always work hard
to stick to the concept.

18
00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:07.133 line:82%
JENNIE, what are you?

19
00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:10.000 line:82%
"Don't catch a cold!"

20
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.300 line:82%
Don't catch a cold!

21
00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:22.300 line:82%
-I'll take the lead.
-All right. Take the lead.

22
00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:23.433 line:82%
Okay.

23
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.433 line:82%
-Is this the place?
-Is this the place?

24
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.367 line:82%
Where are we staying today?

25
00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:29.600 line:82%
-Is this the place?

26
00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:30.500 line:82%
JENNIE.

27
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.033 line:82%
-Are we entering together?
-Let's enter.

28
00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:35.433 line:82%
Jae-seok, the unit has gotten bigger.

29
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.667 line:82%
This place is big.

30
00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:40.166 line:82%
-This place is so cozy.
-It's so cute.

31
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.467 line:82%
It's warm too.

32
00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.900 line:82%
I want to have sweet potatoes here.

33
00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:56.266 line:82%
There's a sewing machine too.

34
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:03.166 line:82%
-It looks lived-in. It's nice.
-As for this place,

35
00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.000 line:82%
the layout…

36
00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:05.934 line:82%
My goodness.

37
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.533 line:82%
-What?
-The rooms are big too.

38
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.834 line:82%
The rooms… Gosh, are there three rooms?

39
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.333 line:82%
It's really big.

40
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.767 line:82%
-It has been remodeled.
-Why is it so big?

41
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.900 line:82%
It brings back memories.

42
00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:32.567 line:82%
It even smells lived-in.

43
00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.734 line:82%
-I love the atmosphere.
-I know.

44
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.767 line:82%
Why is this unit so big?

45
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.133 line:82%
It's a household with children.

46
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.533 line:82%
Hey, look it's
Don** Jeongwa.

47
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.333 line:82%
-My goodness.
-When I was a kid, it was like a phone.

48
00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:51.500 line:82%
I wish there was no homework.

49
00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:00.266 line:82%
It has all the answers.

50
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:01.400 line:82%

Jeongwa?

51

-I don't have a clue today.
-What?

54
00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:09.800 line:82%
I was born in 1986,

55
00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:11.166 line:82%
so I was 5 in 1991.

56
00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:14.300 line:82%
You were five?
Then you wouldn't remember anything.

57
00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:17.233 line:82%
Hold on. JENNIE wasn't even born.

58
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.433 line:82%
It was years before my birth.

59
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.567 line:82%
Years before her birth.

60
00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:25.667 line:82%

-Pull it or push it.

88
00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:40.200 line:82%
We aren't the only ones who should learn.

Hey, there are so many people.

159
00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:35.633 line:82%
-Really?
-We're sorry.

160
00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:45.800 line:82%
The neighbors are cleaning the apartment
to welcome spring.

161
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.900 line:82%
Why won't the grime come off?

162
00:08:55.967 --> 00:08:57.433 line:82%
Scrub hard.

163
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.600 line:82%
My back hurts.

164
00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:01.600 line:82%
This is killing my back.

165
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.400 line:82%
Gosh, everyone is cleaning.

166
00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:09.700 line:82%
-When did they come out?
-Seriously.

167
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.433 line:82%
There are so many people.

168
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.500 line:82%
-What am I supposed to do?
-It's cramped here.

169
00:09:14.567 --> 00:09:16.734 line:82%
-There's no space.
-Seriously.

170
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.800 line:82%
-Jung-ha, move.
-Am I doing it wrong?

171
00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:25.467 line:82%
-Move.
-Am I doing it wrong?

172
00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:27.567 line:82%
-"I'm moving."
-No.

173
00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:28.500 line:82%
"It isn't me."

174
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.700 line:82%
That's Jung-ha's catchphrase. Move.

175
00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:33.133 line:82%
Your section is the dirtiest.

176
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.734 line:82%
We cleaned our sections,
so you should clean yours.

177
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.100 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

178
00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:39.400 line:82%
-Why are they saying our section is dirty?
-Right.

179
00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:42.100 line:82%
Is there something wrong with our section?

180
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:44.100 line:82%
-We've cleaned up a lot.
-Yes.

181
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.000 line:82%
Cleaned up a lot, my foot.
It's still dirty.

182
00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:49.467 line:82%
Scrub hard so that it becomes clean.

183
00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:50.934 line:82%
Let's scrub hard.

184
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.133 line:82%
Okay.

185
00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:55.166 line:82%
You're working hard on a cold day.

186
00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:56.533 line:82%
-Yes.
-Yes.

187
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.633 line:82%
Have a cup of hot coffee.

188
00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.700 line:82%
That sounds great.

189
00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:01.633 line:82%
Come. Come over here.

190
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.066 line:82%
-Shall we do that? Let's do that.
-All right.

191
00:10:05.133 --> 00:10:07.867 line:82%
-Shall we do that?
-It was exhausting.

192
00:10:07.934 --> 00:10:09.233 line:82%
-Thank you.
-I love it.

193
00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:12.800 line:82%
-Isn't it nice?
-Yes.

194
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.200 line:82%
Ms. Resident Representative,
can we have some too?

195
00:10:16.266 --> 00:10:18.166 line:82%
Wait patiently, okay?

196
00:10:19.233 --> 00:10:20.367 line:82%
I just made one comment.

197
00:10:20.433 --> 00:10:21.867 line:82%
"Wait patiently, okay?"

198
00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:23.767 line:82%
-Is it coffee?
-Yes.

199
00:10:23.834 --> 00:10:26.467 line:82%
-We were craving coffee.
-That's right.

200
00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:27.900 line:82%
-Oh, no.
-What's wrong?

201
00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:29.400 line:82%
I'm out of coffee.

202
00:10:29.467 --> 00:10:31.367 line:82%
-No way.
-Oh, no.

203
00:10:31.433 --> 00:10:33.734 line:82%
-Wait right here. I'll bring some more.
-Okay.

204
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.834 line:82%
Okay.

205
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.700 line:82%
How did she run out of coffee?

206
00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:38.300 line:82%
All right.

207
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.066 line:82%
My goodness.

208
00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:47.033 line:82%
Woo-il.

209
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.100 line:82%
-Woo-il, you came.
-Mr. Security Guard.

210
00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:51.767 line:82%
-I thought you weren't coming today.
-Hey.

211
00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:54.300 line:82%
-I thought you got fired.
-We were worried.

212
00:10:54.367 --> 00:10:56.600 line:82%
-I thought you went someplace else.
-Yes.

213
00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:58.633 line:82%
I almost had to retire, but I got lucky.

214
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.767 line:82%
-Thank goodness.
-I can work some more.

215
00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:03.433 line:82%
-That's good to hear.
-Thank goodness.

216
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.600 line:82%
Are there no problems with this apartment?

217
00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:07.033 line:82%
Today, there are no--

218
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.100 line:82%
-What?
-What's going on?

219
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.667 line:82%
-What's going on?
-What's the matter?

220
00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:16.967 line:82%
-What?
-What's going on?

221
00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:18.233 line:82%
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

222
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.900 line:82%
-What?
-Ma'am, what's wrong?

223
00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:23.667 line:82%
-Ma'am.
-What happened?

224
00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.066 line:82%
-What's the matter?
-What?

225
00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:26.433 line:82%
What's going on?

226
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.567 line:82%
My goodness.

227
00:11:27.633 --> 00:11:30.467 line:82%
-She's foaming at the mouth.
-Call 119.

228
00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:32.133 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Call 119.

229
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.800 line:82%
-Oh, no.
-Are you okay?

230
00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:35.633 line:82%
Oh, no.

231
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.166 line:82%
-What's wrong?
-What's going on?

232
00:11:38.233 --> 00:11:41.433 line:82%
The residents who collapsed
are now in critical condition.

233
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.867 line:82%
Wake up.

234
00:11:43.433 --> 00:11:45.834 line:82%
A toxin was found
in the neighbors' bodies.

235
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.100 line:82%
-Excuse me.
-Oh, no.

236
00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:55.467 line:82%
Mister, what should we do?

237
00:11:55.533 --> 00:11:57.600 line:82%
-Call 119.
-Call 119.

238
00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:59.667 line:82%
-Are you okay?
-Hurry up and do something.

239
00:11:59.734 --> 00:12:02.266 line:82%
Hold on. I'll go and call an ambulance.

240
00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:04.000 line:82%
I'll go and call an ambulance.

241
00:12:04.066 --> 00:12:05.767 line:82%
-Did you call 119?
-Yes.

242
00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:07.166 line:82%
-Hurry up.
-He did.

243
00:12:07.233 --> 00:12:11.367 line:82%
-He did.
-I can't believe it.

244
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.033 line:82%
-The ambulance is here.
-It actually came.

245
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.100 line:82%
-It's here.
-Is it here?

246
00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:20.667 line:82%
Over here.

247
00:12:21.233 --> 00:12:23.533 line:82%
-Over here.
-Isn't that a police car?

248
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.266 line:82%
Police officers came.

249
00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:28.233 line:82%
-Over here.
-Over here.

250
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.000 line:82%
-They collapsed.
-How did this happen?

251
00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:33.266 line:82%
See? What's the matter?

252
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.900 line:82%
Why did you only bring one stretcher
when three people collapsed?

253
00:12:39.367 --> 00:12:41.700 line:82%
-They'll carry them on their backs.
-I see.

254
00:12:41.767 --> 00:12:44.867 line:82%
-They'll carry them on their backs.
-I think they rehearsed it.

255
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.667 line:82%
-They have good teamwork.
-It was well organized.

256
00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:49.233 line:82%
They have good teamwork.

257
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.300 line:82%
-Ma'am, wake up.
-How did this happen?

258
00:12:52.367 --> 00:12:56.700 line:82%
-How did this happen?
-He's the only one who didn't collapse.

259
00:12:56.767 --> 00:12:58.400 line:82%
-Are you the culprit?
-Mister.

260
00:13:02.834 --> 00:13:03.834 line:82%
We're the police.

261
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.867 line:82%
-Hello.
-Hello.

262
00:13:05.934 --> 00:13:09.700 line:82%
-Who's the resident representative?
-Me. What is it?

263
00:13:09.767 --> 00:13:12.100 line:82%
The residents collapsed after drinking

264
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.934 line:82%
the coffee you made.

265
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.600 line:82%
-We received a report.
-A report?

266
00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:17.600 line:82%
I simply gave them coffee

267
00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:19.467 line:82%
since the weather was cold. Why?

268
00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:22.533 line:82%
Is there something wrong with my coffee?

269
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.000 line:82%
Let's talk further at the station.

270
00:13:25.066 --> 00:13:26.967 line:82%
-What are you talking about?
-Are you okay?

271
00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:29.900 line:82%
I don't like coffee,
so I didn't have any.

272
00:13:29.967 --> 00:13:31.834 line:82%
You should accompany us as a witness.

273
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.367 line:82%
-Do I need to go too?
-Yes.

274
00:13:33.433 --> 00:13:34.600 line:82%
-You should go.
-You should go.

275
00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:36.567 line:82%
-You should go.
-You should go.

276
00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:38.600 line:82%
-You should go.
-Why do I need to go?

277
00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:39.567 line:82%
My goodness.

278
00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:41.066 line:82%
The truth will prevail.

279
00:13:45.333 --> 00:13:47.633 line:82%
I'll go with them,

280
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.000 line:82%
-so wait in unit 504.
-Unit 504?

281
00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:51.867 line:82%
Where are you going? Why?

282
00:13:51.934 --> 00:13:53.900 line:82%
-I need to look into things.
-You have to pay me 500 won.

283
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.100 line:82%
-Don't go.
-Share information.

284
00:13:55.166 --> 00:13:56.367 line:82%
-Sip a little bit.
-No.

285
00:13:56.433 --> 00:13:58.433 line:82%
I need to look into things.

286
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.967 line:82%
-Get going.
-I need to look into things.

287
00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:02.300 line:82%
-Go inside.
-Okay.

288
00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:03.800 line:82%
Go inside unit 504.

289
00:14:03.867 --> 00:14:05.533 line:82%
-Go inside unit 504.
-What's happening?

290
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.467 line:82%
I think we have a team competition today.

291
00:14:07.533 --> 00:14:08.967 line:82%
No suspecting each other.

292
00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:11.100 line:82%
This is evidence.

293
00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:13.900 line:82%
-You brought it?
-I brought it just in case.

294
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.433 line:82%
It seems like regular coffee.

295
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.667 line:82%
-She did run out. The container is empty.
-Yes.

296
00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:20.600 line:82%
-There's coffee, Na-ra.
-There's coffee.

297
00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:23.767 line:82%
-There's so much coffee.
-Try it.

298
00:14:23.834 --> 00:14:26.900 line:82%
-Try it.
-Na-ra made a mess again.

299
00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:28.900 line:82%
-There she goes again.
-Seriously.

300
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.800 line:82%
-Hey, don't drink it.
-How does it taste?

301
00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:35.767 line:82%
What?

302
00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.033 line:82%
-Is it good?
-He's out.

303
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.600 line:82%
-It's bitter.
-It's bitter.

304
00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:42.667 line:82%
I can't believe him.

305
00:14:42.734 --> 00:14:45.867 line:82%
It's funny that the incident happened
as soon as Woo-il arrived.

306
00:14:45.934 --> 00:14:47.066 line:82%
Mr. Incident.

307
00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:49.734 line:82%
Jung-ha said something
when the police officers came.

308
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.300 line:82%
-What did he say?
-"The truth will prevail."

309
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.967 line:82%
"The truth will prevail."

310
00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:56.200 line:82%
I like things like that.

311
00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:00.734 line:82%
Is it okay to just sit around like this?

312
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.600 line:82%
The incident took place
in front of unit 505.

313
00:15:03.667 --> 00:15:05.667 line:82%
The resident representative
is the culprit.

314
00:15:05.734 --> 00:15:08.367 line:82%
-That man was suspicious too.
-That man.

315
00:15:08.934 --> 00:15:11.867 line:82%
I simply gave them coffee
since the weather was cold.

316
00:15:11.934 --> 00:15:13.400 line:82%
How did this happen?

317
00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:17.133 line:82%
You're working hard on a cold day.

318
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.700 line:82%
-Shall we go and take a look?
-Shall we?

319
00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:22.600 line:82%
-Let's look around unit 505.
-Okay.

320
00:15:30.066 --> 00:15:33.100 line:82%
-All right. Let's unveil the truth.
-Okay.

321
00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:43.000 line:82%
This is the crime scene.

322
00:15:43.066 --> 00:15:44.633 line:82%
-This is it.
-This is it.

323
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.467 line:82%
This is the place
we need to examine thoroughly.

324
00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:50.467 line:82%
Is this
the resident representative's place?

325
00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:53.367 line:82%
This place is big.

326
00:15:53.433 --> 00:15:56.967 line:82%
Jae-seok, this place exudes wealth.

327
00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:02.300 line:82%
It's a wealthy household.

328
00:16:03.033 --> 00:16:04.133 line:82%
It's a wealthy household.

329
00:16:04.967 --> 00:16:08.433 line:82%
The furniture is extravagant.

330
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.567 line:82%
Luxury items.

331
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.266 line:82%
Why is there so much water
in the resident representative's unit?

332
00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.867 line:82%
Gosh, there's so much water.

333
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.300 line:82%
Why is there so much water?

334
00:16:22.867 --> 00:16:24.533 line:82%
This place is strange.

335
00:16:32.967 --> 00:16:34.900 line:82%
The furniture is extravagant.

336
00:16:36.867 --> 00:16:40.233 line:82%
-Back in 1991, bottled water…
-It wasn't common.

337
00:16:47.367 --> 00:16:49.100 line:82%
What are we supposed to look at?

338
00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:53.900 line:82%
I see that
The General's Son 2
came out in 1991.

339
00:16:53.967 --> 00:16:57.667 line:82%
Was Seok-jin popular in 1991?

340
00:16:57.734 --> 00:17:00.533 line:82%
Na-ra, when Seok-jin debuted,

341
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.867 line:82%
his album went up
against
I Know
by Seo Taiji and Boys.

342
00:17:03.934 --> 00:17:05.200 line:82%
He got annihilated.

343
00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:13.533 line:82%
VIDEO NOT FOUND
DUE TO A LACK OF POPULARITY

344
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.467 line:82%
-His agency lacked producing skills.
-Yes.

345
00:17:15.533 --> 00:17:19.133 line:82%
On top of that, Seok-jin didn't have
the skills to be an entertainer.

346
00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:22.567 line:82%
All right.

347
00:17:33.367 --> 00:17:35.200 line:82%
-Only Wednesday…
-Right?

348
00:17:36.967 --> 00:17:38.300 line:82%
Wednesday.

349
00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:43.166 line:82%
I think we're missing the hidden clues.

350
00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:45.633 line:82%
What's this?

351
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.066 line:82%
-There are a lot of cosmetics.
-Really?

352
00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:57.567 line:82%
Let's take a look.

353
00:17:57.633 --> 00:17:58.633 line:82%
-Are there a lot?
-Really?

354
00:18:02.934 --> 00:18:04.433 line:82%
Why are there so many cosmetics?

355
00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:11.033 line:82%
My goodness.

356
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.166 line:82%
-What do they mean?
-Are those cosmetics?

357
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.667 line:82%
What is it?

358
00:18:18.166 --> 00:18:20.033 line:82%
Hide it quickly.

359
00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:23.000 line:82%
Hide it quickly.

360
00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:24.667 line:82%
-I think it's nothing.
-Let's see.

361
00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:26.266 line:82%
It's a list of contacts.

362
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.734 line:82%
She made a lot of money.

363
00:18:36.433 --> 00:18:38.200 line:82%
I think it's a clue.

364
00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:56.767 line:82%
-Se-chan, they're here too.
-What?

365
00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:59.200 line:82%
-What?
-We have these figurines at our place too.

366
00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:01.700 line:82%
-Look.
-Yes, the Mandarin ducks.

367
00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:03.934 line:82%
What do the Mandarin ducks represent?

368
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.033 line:82%
Isn't it love?

369
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.867 line:82%
If you position them like this,
it's a signal.

370
00:19:08.934 --> 00:19:11.800 line:82%
It's a signal for a romantic night.

371
00:19:11.867 --> 00:19:13.100 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

372
00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:16.300 line:82%
-If you're mad at your spouse…
-That's right.

373
00:19:16.367 --> 00:19:18.133 line:82%
My goodness.

374
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.834 line:82%
-It's a signal.
-That sounds useful.

375
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.066 line:82%
That's right.

376
00:19:23.133 --> 00:19:25.367 line:82%
You didn't know. It's a signal.

377
00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:29.734 line:82%
We don't know anything yet, right?

378
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.166 line:82%
We don't know anything yet.

379
00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:32.333 line:82%
Jae-seok.

380
00:19:34.166 --> 00:19:35.367 line:82%
What's going on today?

381
00:19:35.433 --> 00:19:36.533 line:82%
-This…
-What?

382
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.133 line:82%
Many things are suspicious.

383
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.467 line:82%
-This…
-What?

384
00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:44.266 line:82%
-"Door-to-door sales".
-"Sunaroun"? What's this?

385
00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:46.467 line:82%
It's a flyer for door-to-door sales.

386
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.867 line:82%
-Door-to-door sales.
-That's what the flyer says.

387
00:19:57.934 --> 00:19:59.200 line:82%
Door-to-door sales.

388
00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:02.600 line:82%
Hold on.

389
00:20:02.667 --> 00:20:04.567 line:82%
Doesn't this face look familiar?

390
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.200 line:82%
-It's the resident representative.
-You're right.

391
00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:13.367 line:82%
-Right?
-I didn't realize.

392
00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:17.433 line:82%
That's right. She must be
a door-to-door salesperson.

393
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.567 line:82%
Does she sell the products she models for?

394
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.000 line:82%
-There's something about her.
-It seems that way.

395
00:20:24.066 --> 00:20:25.367 line:82%
Sunaroun.

396
00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:27.900 line:82%
There must be something about this.

397
00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:30.000 line:82%
Let's take it.

398
00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:30.900 line:82%
Hey.

399
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.266 line:82%
Hey.

400
00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.900 line:82%
-The TV is turning on.
-Hey.

401
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.700 line:82%
-The TV is turning on.
-Hey.

402
00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:38.734 line:82%
Come over here.

403
00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:45.066 line:82%
-Come over here.
-I'm having fun already.

404
00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:48.667 line:82%
-What is it?
-What is it?

405
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.233 line:82%
What's going on?

406
00:20:54.066 --> 00:20:55.000 line:82%
What's going on?

407
00:20:57.967 --> 00:21:00.133 line:82%
-I remember this.
-I do too.

408
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.166 line:82%
I remember this.

409
00:21:05.266 --> 00:21:08.834 line:82%
Once you get hooked on drugs,
it isn't easy to find a way out.

410
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.734 line:82%
It's the bait of destruction.

411
00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:14.700 line:82%
-Drugs?
-A public campaign.

412
00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:16.800 line:82%
Another public campaign?

413
00:21:16.867 --> 00:21:19.166 line:82%
"I'll do anything for money.

414
00:21:19.233 --> 00:21:22.166 line:82%
There's nothing I can't do
to make ends meet."

415
00:21:22.233 --> 00:21:26.467 line:82%
An incident that was
the epitome of mammonism took place.

416
00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:28.367 line:82%
-…took place.
-Mammonism.

417
00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:32.333 line:82%
In mid-August,
Mr. Hyun sent a letter to…

418
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.000 line:82%
…and threatened to poison yogurt drinks
unless he got 250 million won.

419
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.300 line:82%
Poison.

420
00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:40.667 line:82%
Since the fourth of last month,
he poisoned

421
00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:43.533 line:82%
-
the yogurt drinks over nine times.
-Poison.

422
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.433 line:82%
This actually happened, right?

423
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.166 line:82%
-Such things happened back then.
-Yes.

424
00:21:48.233 --> 00:21:50.233 line:82%
Poison was injected with a needle.

425
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.800 line:82%
Victims who drank
the poisoned yogurt drinks

426
00:21:52.867 --> 00:21:55.100 line:82%
fell into critical condition
before becoming stable.

427
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:57.266 line:82%
A total of five people were harmed.

428
00:21:58.333 --> 00:21:59.533 line:82%
My goodness.

429
00:22:00.266 --> 00:22:02.333 line:82%
Mr. Kim, the site manager
of the Korea Water Resources Corporation,

430
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.500 line:82%
regularly accepted bribes
from a construction company.

431
00:22:05.567 --> 00:22:07.433 line:82%
He got arrested by the prosecution.

432
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.333 line:82%
Due to the thoughtless extravagance
of the middle class,

433
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.934 line:82%
disharmony between classes is growing.

434
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.233 line:82%
The middle class?

435
00:22:17.867 --> 00:22:20.633 line:82%
Despite the effort
to spur economic growth,

436
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.400 line:82%
heinous crimes that were brought on
by mammonism and extravagance

437
00:22:24.467 --> 00:22:26.700 line:82%
are poisoning our society.

438
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.900 line:82%
What?

439
00:22:28.967 --> 00:22:30.133 line:82%
Is it about drugs?

440
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.433 line:82%
Is the incident related to poison?

441
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.867 line:82%
I think bribery is involved too.

442
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.767 line:82%
"I'll do anything for money."

443
00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:39.300 line:82%
…he poisoned the yogurt drinks…

444
00:22:39.367 --> 00:22:41.333 line:82%
Due to the thoughtless extravagance…

445
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.734 line:82%
…disharmony between classes is growing.

446
00:22:44.233 --> 00:22:47.367 line:82%
They talked about luxury items.

447
00:22:47.433 --> 00:22:48.300 line:82%
Luxury items.

448
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.333 line:82%
Bribes.

449
00:22:49.934 --> 00:22:51.033 line:82%
Luxury items.

450
00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:54.200 line:82%
Did the resident representative do it
for money?

451
00:22:59.467 --> 00:23:01.166 line:82%
What's the matter?

452
00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:02.834 line:82%
Don't accuse an innocent woman.

453
00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:05.333 line:82%
Should we check this?

454
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.500 line:82%
Right? Is there something inside?

455
00:23:09.066 --> 00:23:11.033 line:82%
-The phone is ringing.
-The phone is ringing.

456
00:23:16.233 --> 00:23:18.033 line:82%
-Pick up the phone.
-Pick up the phone.

457
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.734 line:82%
Hello?

458
00:23:22.967 --> 00:23:26.533 line:82%
This is Min-su's family.
Bring me three boxes right away.

459
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.433 line:82%
What?

460
00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:29.433 line:82%
Hello?

461
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.066 line:82%
-What?
-What?

462
00:23:33.133 --> 00:23:34.900 line:82%
-Did the caller hang up?
-Did they stay silent?

463
00:23:35.967 --> 00:23:37.367 line:82%
She said, "Bring me three boxes."

464
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.834 line:82%
Is it this?

465
00:23:43.734 --> 00:23:45.133 line:82%
-This?
-Is it this?

466
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.767 line:82%
-Three boxes?
-Three boxes.

467
00:23:46.834 --> 00:23:48.600 line:82%
-Maybe it's water.
-Three boxes of water.

468
00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:51.233 line:82%
You wouldn't describe water that way.
Three containers, maybe.

469
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.300 line:82%
Drugs? Maybe this is a drug house.

470
00:23:53.367 --> 00:23:54.934 line:82%
Three boxes?

471
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.767 line:82%
-You can't deliver three boxes of drugs.
-That'd be expensive.

472
00:23:57.834 --> 00:23:59.734 line:82%
-A drug house.

All right.

474
00:24:05.266 --> 00:24:08.333 line:82%
The caller asked for three boxes
and hung up immediately.

475
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.800 line:82%
-It has to be an illegal transaction.
-What kind of a box could it be?

476
00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:14.834 line:82%
Why was it said so secretly?

477
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.033 line:82%
The caller wasn't high on drugs,
were they?

478
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.233 line:82%
They didn't seem to be.

479
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.667 line:82%
-Did she enunciate?
-The caller was a woman.

480
00:24:20.734 --> 00:24:24.133 line:82%
-Was she in a hurry?
-She sounded secretive.

481
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.700 line:82%
What's the secret today?

482
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.567 line:82%
So many things are suspicious.

483
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400 line:82%
What's illegal?

484
00:24:31.467 --> 00:24:33.400 line:82%
Cosmetics? Water?

485
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.500 line:82%

-Mr. Security Guard.

488
00:24:40.967 --> 00:24:43.500 line:82%
I told you to wait at your place.

489
00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:46.333 line:82%
Why did you come
to the resident representative's unit?

490
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.200 line:82%
Just in case.

491
00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:51.433 line:82%
The atmosphere is not good,
so go to your place.

492
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.467 line:82%
-Shall we do that?
-Go to your place.

493
00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:55.266 line:82%
What could be the secret?

494
00:24:56.467 --> 00:24:59.300 line:82%
-Hurry up and come on out.
-Okay.

495
00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:00.800 line:82%
Come on out.

496
00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:03.100 line:82%
All right. Come on out.

497
00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:05.367 line:82%
It's inconvenient. Are there slippers?

498
00:25:05.433 --> 00:25:07.333 line:82%
-You shouldn't be here.
-Slippers.

499
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.467 line:82%
-Slippers?
-Yes.

500
00:25:08.533 --> 00:25:10.900 line:82%
-Why are you looking for them here?
-Slippers.

501
00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:13.567 line:82%
-You can't take them.
-I was going to borrow them.

502
00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:14.767 line:82%
Go on in.

503
00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:22.033 line:82%
Gather around. It's time for a game.

504
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.333 line:82%
That's good.

505

Let's go. It's party time.

506

-Let's play a game.
-Come on out.

508
00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:33.700 line:82%
-Let's play a game.
-Let's play a game for a hint.

509
00:25:33.767 --> 00:25:35.467 line:82%
What could the secret be?

510
00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:36.900 line:82%
I don't have a clue today.

511
00:25:39.467 --> 00:25:42.667 line:82%
Did you make that, mister?
Where did you get that?

512
00:25:42.734 --> 00:25:44.867 line:82%
-All right. I'll explain.
-Okay.

513
00:25:44.934 --> 00:25:46.266 line:82%
-It's simple.
-Okay.

514
00:25:47.967 --> 00:25:50.734 line:82%
Roll the dice and find the rainbow items.

515
00:25:52.066 --> 00:25:54.967 line:82%
-The Ohs and the Yus.
-The Ohs and the Yus.

517
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.433 line:82%
-I'll roll the dice.
-You'll roll it.

518
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.734 line:82%
Let's say I get blue.

519
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.233 line:82%
Then all six members must bring an item
that is related to blue.

520
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.767 line:82%
Put them on the table, and it's over.

521
00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:11.767 line:82%
-It's so easy.
-It's easy.

528
00:26:23.633 --> 00:26:25.200 line:82%
-Speak for yourself.
-Okay.

529
00:26:25.266 --> 00:26:27.133 line:82%
The living room is too close,

530
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.133 line:82%
-so the items must be from elsewhere.
-Okay.

531

628
00:31:11.834 --> 00:31:12.834 line:82%
Hold on.

629
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.367 line:82%
We need to look for an item.

630
00:31:15.433 --> 00:31:16.633 line:82%
We need to look for it.

631
00:31:18.667 --> 00:31:19.633 line:82%
-It's me.
-Right.

632
00:31:21.667 --> 00:31:22.767 line:82%
Calendar.

633
00:31:22.834 --> 00:31:25.333 line:82%
Calendar. Okay, that counts.
Calendar counts.

634
00:31:26.033 --> 00:31:27.800 line:82%
Digeut.

635
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.867 line:82%
All right.

636

HAIR DRYER

637
00:31:37.233 --> 00:31:39.133 line:82%
Let me pass through!

638
00:31:41.734 --> 00:31:43.000 line:82%
Hey.

639
00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:44.667 line:82%

-Hey, JENNIE.
-JENNIE, hurry up and go.

642
00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.500 line:82%
Hey, JENNIE.

643
00:31:52.567 --> 00:31:53.567 line:82%
JENNIE.

644
00:31:53.633 --> 00:31:54.667 line:82%
Hey.

645
00:31:54.734 --> 00:31:56.333 line:82%
JENNIE. Hey.

646
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.667 line:82%
She kicked my side.

JENNIE kicked my side.

648
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.633 line:82%
Hurry up and find it. Okay.

649
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.000 line:82%
-Hair dryer.
-Hair dryer counts.

650
00:32:06.934 --> 00:32:09.967 line:82%
Me. I'm a lunatic.

651
00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:12.433 line:82%
Lunatic starts with
ssang digeut.
It doesn't count.

652
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.066 line:82%
Lunatic doesn't work.

653
00:32:17.066 --> 00:32:18.900 line:82%
Come here. Let's mark Jae-seok.

654
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.100 line:82%
What items are there?
Digeut.

00:32:27.867 --> 00:32:29.133 line:82%
Do you want to go out?

657
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.467 line:82%
-Se-chan, he's your responsibility.
-What's this?

658
00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:35.700 line:82%
Se-chan, he's your responsibility.

659
00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:37.367 line:82%
-Give it to me.
-No.

660
00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:38.900 line:82%
No. Hey, stop him.

663
00:32:43.166 --> 00:32:44.900 line:82%
Only Jae-seok remains.

664
00:32:44.967 --> 00:32:47.333 line:82%
Stop him. Na-ra, stop him.

665
00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:50.333 line:82%

668
00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:55.633 line:82%
JENNIE kicked my side.

669
00:32:57.433 --> 00:33:00.200 line:82%
-
Don** Jeongwa
.
-Okay.
Don** Jeongwa
counts.

670
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.533 line:82%
It's okay. It's over.

671
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.900 line:82%
-It counts.
-
Don** Jeongwa.

672
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.333 line:82%
You got kicked by JENNIE many times.

673
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.100 line:82%
-JENNIE kicked my side.
-Me?

674
00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:15.900 line:82%
Me? When did I do that?

675
00:33:15.967 --> 00:33:18.967 line:82%
She went, "When did I do that?"

676
00:33:19.033 --> 00:33:21.100 line:82%
-"Me?"
-She kicked my side.

677
00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:23.567 line:82%
JENNIE was good at the game.

678
00:33:23.633 --> 00:33:26.667 line:82%
-She kicked my side.
-It was so much fun.

679
00:33:26.734 --> 00:33:28.567 line:82%
She punched the side.

680
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.967 line:82%
-The last round.
-Come here.

681
00:33:34.066 --> 00:33:36.734 line:82%
-Let's go.

-Go.
-Green.

687
00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:00.500 line:82%
It counts. Yellow green doesn't count.

688
00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:02.700 line:82%
-Why?
-It's yellow green.

689
00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:05.367 line:82%
-It's yellow green.
-For goodness' sake. It's green.

690
00:34:05.433 --> 00:34:07.834 line:82%
This green item counts.

691
00:34:08.333 --> 00:34:09.333 line:82%
This green item counts.

692
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.000 line:82%
-Green.
-It's yellow green.

693
00:34:11.066 --> 00:34:13.000 line:82%
Stop saying it's yellow green.

694
00:34:14.133 --> 00:34:15.300 line:82%
All right.

695
00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:18.734 line:82%
-Workbook.
-It's yellow green.

696
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.800 line:82%
-Why do you keep saying that?
-I'm serious.

697
00:34:21.867 --> 00:34:25.066 line:82%
Compared to other items,
it's yellow green.

698
00:34:25.133 --> 00:34:26.367 line:82%
Green.

699
00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:32.467 line:82%
-Green.
-Well…

700
00:34:32.533 --> 00:34:34.500 line:82%
-Okay, this item counts.
-Green. Okay.

701
00:34:34.567 --> 00:34:36.300 line:82%

JENNIE, come here.

706
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.667 line:82%
I'm stuck here.

707
00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:50.300 line:82%
-Where?
-Where?

708
00:34:50.367 --> 00:34:52.233 line:82%
-Green.
-It isn't green.

709
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.200 line:82%
-It won't do.
-No?

710
00:34:53.266 --> 00:34:54.233 line:82%
There are no items.

711
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.633 line:82%
-There are no green items.
-Se-chan.

712
00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.066 line:82%
Se-chan.

713
00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:01.367 line:82%
Okay. It's a green item.

714
00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:03.500 line:82%
-Green.
-It's green, right?

715
00:35:03.567 --> 00:35:05.066 line:82%
-Okay, it counts.
-Okay. All done.

716
00:35:05.133 --> 00:35:06.667 line:82%
-We won.

-All done?
-We won.

718
00:35:07.967 --> 00:35:08.934 line:82%
Okay.

719
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.300 line:82%
The Ohs won.

720
00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:11.433 line:82%
-The Ohs won.
-The Ohs.

721
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.533 line:82%
Who hasn't gone?

722
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.233 line:82%
-We were done.
-Who hasn't gone?

723
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.066 line:82%
-We were done.
-We were done.

724
00:35:16.133 --> 00:35:17.233 line:82%
-We were done.
-Why…

725
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.000 line:82%
-Why did you…
-For fun.

726
00:35:19.066 --> 00:35:20.033 line:82%
What?

727
00:35:21.033 --> 00:35:22.700 line:82%
Did they toy with us?

728
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.266 line:82%
When did you guys finish? Is it true?

729
00:35:27.767 --> 00:35:30.700 line:82%
-Green.
-It counts. Yellow green doesn't count.

730
00:35:30.767 --> 00:35:32.900 line:82%
-It's green.
-Okay, it counts.

731
00:35:32.967 --> 00:35:33.934 line:82%
-It counts.
-Okay.

732
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.033 line:82%
-Okay, it counts.
-Okay.

733
00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:37.000 line:82%
-The Yus won.
-We won.

734
00:35:37.066 --> 00:35:37.900 line:82%
Okay.

735
00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:41.467 line:82%
-The Yus won.
-We won all three rounds.

736
00:35:41.533 --> 00:35:43.300 line:82%
-Let's go, Yus.
-Let's go.

737
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.500 line:82%
It's hard to bear.
How much longer do I have to wait?

738
00:35:47.567 --> 00:35:49.166 line:82%
I'll die at this rate.

739
00:35:49.233 --> 00:35:51.934 line:82%
Hurry up and bring me three boxes, okay?

740
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.667 line:82%
I feel like I'm dying.

741
00:35:53.734 --> 00:35:55.967 line:82%
Please bring one box. Hurry up.

742
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.133 line:82%
I'll die at this rate.

743
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.467 line:82%
-Since we won, there'll be a hint.
-We'll get something.

744
00:36:10.533 --> 00:36:12.033 line:82%
-We'll get it with the food.
-Yes.

745
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.967 line:82%
I bet it's coming.

746
00:36:14.734 --> 00:36:15.934 line:82%
Why are you looking at that?

747
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.734 line:82%
I'm looking for clues.

748
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.567 line:82%
This is…

749
00:36:21.633 --> 00:36:25.700 line:82%
Come to think of it,
I've teamed up with the sneakiest members

750
00:36:25.767 --> 00:36:27.767 line:82%
of
Apartment404
.

751
00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:30.667 line:82%
-JENNIE is--
-She's sneaky.

752
00:36:30.734 --> 00:36:32.233 line:82%
-Me?
-She's no joke.

753
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.867 line:82%
She's becoming sneakier.

754
00:36:33.934 --> 00:36:37.000 line:82%
-She's very sneaky.
-My goodness.

755
00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:38.633 line:82%
She's very sneaky.

756
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.000 line:82%
No, I'm not.

757
00:36:40.066 --> 00:36:43.000 line:82%
Se-chan acts sneaky,
but he gets fooled in the end.

758
00:36:43.066 --> 00:36:44.333 line:82%
The new sneaky one.

759
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.567 line:82%
-She's a sneaky one.
-I watch and learn.

760
00:36:46.633 --> 00:36:48.467 line:82%
I learned a lot from Se-chan.

761
00:36:49.166 --> 00:36:50.834 line:82%
-Se-chan, today…
-Yes?

762
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.467 line:82%
-Are my eyes playing tricks on me?
-Why?

763
00:36:52.533 --> 00:36:53.767 line:82%
You look handsome.

764
00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:55.433 line:82%
-I know. I was so surprised.
-Really?

765
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.133 line:82%
-Yes, you look cool.
-Seriously.

766
00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.100 line:82%
-Really? In 1991…
-Yes.

767
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:02.433 line:82%
You became cooler after joining Antenna.

768
00:37:03.233 --> 00:37:04.834 line:82%
-It's the Antenna magic.
-I guess so.

769
00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.900 line:82%
In my opinion, today's case is
about a married couple's scam.

770
00:37:08.967 --> 00:37:10.133 line:82%
-Hurry over here.
-Why?

771
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.734 line:82%
He's making wild guesses again.

772
00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.800 line:82%
-Look.
-What?

773
00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:19.000 line:82%
-The Mandarin ducks.
-Is everything in pairs?

774
00:37:19.066 --> 00:37:20.633 line:82%
-This too.
-A married couple's scam.

775
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.934 line:82%
The other unit was the same.

776
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.300 line:82%
That's a pair too.

777
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.300 line:82%
You're right. They're in pairs.

778
00:37:26.367 --> 00:37:28.266 line:82%
There are two fish too.

779
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:29.667 line:82%
There are three.

780
00:37:31.567 --> 00:37:34.367 line:82%
There are three.

781
00:37:34.433 --> 00:37:36.166 line:82%
-One is an outcast.
-An outcast?

782
00:37:36.233 --> 00:37:37.800 line:82%
-Is it a baby?
-Maybe not.

783
00:37:38.934 --> 00:37:40.233 line:82%
-Maybe not.
-Let's look over there.

784
00:37:42.133 --> 00:37:44.567 line:82%
-Everything is in pairs.
-Maybe not.

785
00:37:44.633 --> 00:37:46.934 line:82%
But it's hard to trust your deductions.

786
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.734 line:82%
Here's what I think.
The resident representative got arrested.

787
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.300 line:82%
Maybe she poisoned the coffee
with that man.

788
00:37:57.367 --> 00:37:59.166 line:82%
-That man?
-Maybe not.

789
00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:02.200 line:82%
Either the man
or the resident representative did it.

790
00:38:02.266 --> 00:38:04.133 line:82%
He didn't drink it since he knew.

791
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.967 line:82%
And in my opinion--
Gosh, I finally figured it out.

792
00:38:07.033 --> 00:38:08.767 line:82%
-What?
-Here we go. It's Jung-ha's time.

793
00:38:08.834 --> 00:38:15.400 line:82%
The resident representative was running
an illegal business in secret.

794
00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:19.233 line:82%
One of the neighbors knew about it,
so she devised a plan to get rid of her.

795
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.734 line:82%
What do you think?

796
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.333 line:82%
-Well…
-Not bad.

797
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.367 line:82%
Anyone can make such deductions.

798
00:38:24.433 --> 00:38:25.900 line:82%
Right?

799
00:38:25.967 --> 00:38:27.867 line:82%
-But--
-So the one who didn't drink

800
00:38:27.934 --> 00:38:29.433 line:82%
-is an accomplice.
-That's right.

801
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.700 line:82%
-Well--
-Na-ra, tell me honestly.

802
00:38:32.767 --> 00:38:36.667 line:82%
Is there a member among us
who knows what's happening?

803
00:38:36.734 --> 00:38:37.867 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-Among us?

804
00:38:37.934 --> 00:38:38.900 line:82%
-Among us.
-No.

805
00:38:38.967 --> 00:38:40.100 line:82%
-No.
-Right?

806
00:38:40.166 --> 00:38:44.967 line:82%
In that case, I'm certain
that the culprit is on the other team.

807
00:38:45.033 --> 00:38:46.200 line:82%
I think it's JENNIE.

808
00:38:46.266 --> 00:38:47.967 line:82%
-JENNIE?
-She's different today.

809
00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:49.300 line:82%
She hit me a lot today.

810
00:38:49.367 --> 00:38:51.233 line:82%
She's energetic today.

811
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.100 line:82%
-She beat me up.
-Did she beat you up?

812
00:38:53.166 --> 00:38:55.734 line:82%
Yes. She kicked my side three times.

813
00:38:57.834 --> 00:38:59.734 line:82%
-Hello.
-My goodness.

814
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800 line:82%
-All right.
-It's from a good restaurant.

815
00:39:01.867 --> 00:39:03.433 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

816
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.734 line:82%
What is it?

817
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.900 line:82%
-It's suyuk.
-Suyuk?

818
00:39:10.567 --> 00:39:12.633 line:82%
What is it? Gosh, it looks tasty.

819
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.533 line:82%
How did you know
that I liked these dishes?

820
00:39:17.033 --> 00:39:19.734 line:82%
The food is from a popular restaurant.
It's very tasty.

821
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.000 line:82%
Try it.

822
00:39:26.266 --> 00:39:28.800 line:82%
-It looks so tasty.
-It looks so tasty.

823
00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.700 line:82%
-It's a proper meal.
-Chopsticks.

824
00:39:31.767 --> 00:39:33.233 line:82%
I brought them.

825
00:39:33.834 --> 00:39:35.700 line:82%
-What?
-There's something, right?

826
00:39:35.767 --> 00:39:38.233 line:82%
-It's a tape.
-Let's watch it.

827
00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:41.433 line:82%
Did we receive the clue?

828
00:39:43.066 --> 00:39:44.600 line:82%
"Unit 505, star"?

829
00:39:44.667 --> 00:39:46.000 line:82%
It's the neighboring unit.

830
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.533 line:82%
I guess it's a hint on unit 505.
We need to go and find it.

831
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.734 line:82%
I guess we need to go to unit 505.

832
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.300 line:82%
It's kalguksu.

833
00:39:54.367 --> 00:39:56.100 line:82%
-Cook it yourself.
-Okay.

834
00:39:56.166 --> 00:39:57.967 line:82%
There's everything, so cook it yourself.

835
00:39:58.033 --> 00:39:59.767 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the food.

836
00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.066 line:82%
What?

837
00:40:05.133 --> 00:40:07.767 line:82%
Unit 505. It's this unit. It's our house.

838
00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:11.567 line:82%
-What could be in here?
-Let's see.

839
00:40:12.734 --> 00:40:16.834 line:82%
Last time, we could open the tub.

840
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.867 line:82%
Is that it?

841
00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:20.400 line:82%
All right.

842
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.266 line:82%
-What could it be?
-Hold on. In this room…

843
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.800 line:82%
My mom once said this to me.

844
00:40:37.133 --> 00:40:38.433 line:82%
This seasoning packet…

845
00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:43.600 line:82%
You have to add the entire contents
of the packet

846
00:40:43.667 --> 00:40:45.467 line:82%
to bring out the taste of ramyeon.

847
00:40:47.166 --> 00:40:48.367 line:82%
Am I the only one who thinks that?

848
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.400 line:82%
All right. I need to add
the seasoning first

849
00:40:54.467 --> 00:40:58.033 line:82%
so that it melts in the water
and makes the soup.

850
00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.600 line:82%
I'll wait until it boils.

851
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.734 line:82%
Now,

852
00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:06.367 line:82%
I'll go and blow my nose.

853
00:41:07.166 --> 00:41:08.500 line:82%
See you in a bit.

854
00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:10.133 line:82%
I'll go and blow my nose.

855
00:41:10.967 --> 00:41:11.900 line:82%
See you in a bit.

856
00:41:18.934 --> 00:41:22.967 line:82%
The overall flow is related to a star.

857
00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:26.400 line:82%
I need to find the excerpt and solve it.

858
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.734 line:82%
"Wear glasses, play the janggu"…

859
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.667 line:82%
How is it related?

860
00:41:45.467 --> 00:41:47.300 line:82%
Firstly-- I need to check the soup.

861
00:41:50.033 --> 00:41:52.633 line:82%
I need to check the soup.
It isn't boiling yet.

862
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.700 line:82%
I need to find a star. A star.

863
00:41:56.667 --> 00:41:58.166 line:82%
Where are the stars?

864
00:42:00.266 --> 00:42:01.400 line:82%
Stars.

865
00:42:03.967 --> 00:42:06.667 line:82%
Stars. Wait, I saw a star earlier.

866
00:42:07.667 --> 00:42:08.800 line:82%
Where was it?

867
00:42:12.133 --> 00:42:14.700 line:82%
Oh, it's here.

868
00:42:24.066 --> 00:42:25.066 line:82%
SLICE AND IT WILL STICK AGAIN

869
00:42:32.867 --> 00:42:34.967 line:82%
WEAR GLASSES, PLAY THE JANGGU,
HAVE FUN, EAT MEAT, EAT DUMPLINGS

870
00:42:35.033 --> 00:42:37.166 line:82%
SLICE AND IT WILL STICK AGAIN

871
00:42:37.734 --> 00:42:38.967 line:82%
Play the video.

872
00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:40.200 line:82%
-Let's watch it.
-Let's watch it.

873
00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:45.400 line:82%
-He really doesn't listen.
-
We have aired

874
00:42:45.467 --> 00:42:48.633 line:82%
the video and music for screen adjustment.

875
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.500 line:82%
-Such things actually aired.
-Now…

876
00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.967 line:82%
-On TV?
-…KVN News
will begin.

877
00:42:57.333 --> 00:43:01.000 line:82%
…began to be manufactured in Korea

878
00:43:01.066 --> 00:43:04.100 line:82%
to be sold to foreigners in Korea
or exported back in 1975.

879
00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:07.667 line:82%
Sales to Korean nationals
were never permitted.

880
00:43:07.734 --> 00:43:09.834 line:82%
But in most apartment complexes…

881
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.000 line:82%
…gets delivered diligently.

882
00:43:13.066 --> 00:43:15.133 line:82%
It's illegal sales.

883
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.633 line:82%
-What? Earlier…
-I know.

884
00:43:18.133 --> 00:43:21.367 line:82%
How many households use it
in this apartment complex?

885
00:43:21.433 --> 00:43:22.800 line:82%
About 40 households.

886
00:43:22.867 --> 00:43:24.900 line:82%
Customers need it,

887
00:43:24.967 --> 00:43:27.000 line:82%
-but it's too expensive.
-Is it illegal?

888
00:43:27.066 --> 00:43:28.567 line:82%
The illegal distribution of…

889
00:43:28.633 --> 00:43:30.967 line:82%
…among the citizens
is becoming widespread,

890
00:43:31.033 --> 00:43:33.033 line:82%
but the government is turning a blind eye.

891
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.633 line:82%
A harsh criticism of disharmony
between the citizens followed.

892
00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.767 line:82%
Since the illegal dealings led
to such problems,

893
00:43:39.834 --> 00:43:43.367 line:82%
the Minister of Health and Social Affairs
prosecuted or closed down

894
00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:46.367 line:82%
48 businesses without a permit.

895
00:43:46.433 --> 00:43:47.533 line:82%
PERMIT REVOKED

896
00:43:57.533 --> 00:43:58.533 line:82%
Hey.

897
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.900 line:82%
Hey.

898
00:44:04.967 --> 00:44:08.300 line:82%
Like I said, it wasn't widespread in 1991.

899
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.400 line:82%
Hey.

900
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.400 line:82%
It's ***.

901
00:44:15.133 --> 00:44:18.300 line:82%
WHAT: UNIT 505, STAR

902
00:44:18.367 --> 00:44:20.700 line:82%
It reads, "Slice and it will stick again."

903
00:44:20.767 --> 00:44:23.300 line:82%
I think it's a hint.

904
00:44:23.367 --> 00:44:25.800 line:82%
"Slice and it will stick again."

905
00:44:26.767 --> 00:44:27.767 line:82%
What is it?

906
00:44:28.567 --> 00:44:31.033 line:82%
SLICE AND IT WILL STICK AGAIN

907
00:44:31.734 --> 00:44:33.800 line:82%
Na-ra, then this is a hint too.

908
00:44:33.867 --> 00:44:35.700 line:82%
-"It will stick again."
-This is a hint too.

909
00:44:35.767 --> 00:44:38.100 line:82%
EXCHANGES CAN BE MADE TWO TIMES
IN FRONT OF THE STAR,

910
00:44:38.166 --> 00:44:39.333 line:82%
BUT NOT BEHIND IT

911
00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.333 line:82%
"Exchanges can be made two times
in front of the star,

912
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.800 line:82%
but not behind it."

913
00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.066 line:82%
There were scribbles.

914
00:44:55.266 --> 00:44:57.166 line:82%
The stars are hints.

915
00:44:57.233 --> 00:44:58.433 line:82%
We need to find the stars.

916
00:45:04.133 --> 00:45:06.433 line:82%
"The house explodes, the dog claps"?

917
00:45:14.734 --> 00:45:19.633 line:82%
"The house explodes, the dog claps."

918
00:45:20.967 --> 00:45:24.567 line:82%
EXCHANGES CAN BE MADE TWO TIMES
IN FRONT OF THE STAR,

919
00:45:24.633 --> 00:45:26.000 line:82%
BUT NOT BEHIND IT

920
00:45:28.433 --> 00:45:30.166 line:82%
I figured it out.

921
00:45:30.233 --> 00:45:31.467 line:82%
It means an exchange of goods.

922
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.233 line:82%
I figured out what the star meant.

923
00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.233 line:82%
-Slicing water with a knife.
-You're smart.

924
00:45:43.867 --> 00:45:44.934 line:82%
This is incredible.

925
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.166 line:82%
GLASSES, MEAT

926
00:45:52.233 --> 00:45:54.633 line:82%
DUMPLINGS, JANGGU

927
00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.367 line:82%
FUN

928
00:45:56.433 --> 00:45:57.633 line:82%
WATER

929
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.033 line:82%
That's it. It's water.

930
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.233 line:82%
Na-ra, it's water. As you said…

931
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.934 line:82%
Cleaning and coffee.
It's related to water.

932
00:46:15.233 --> 00:46:16.166 line:82%
Hey.

933
00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.533 line:82%
It's bottled water.

934
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.433 line:82%
-Bottled water?
-Bottled water.

935
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.033 line:82%
-Bottled water was precious back then.
-Bottled water.

936
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.000 line:82%
People bought it in secret back then.

937
00:46:26.066 --> 00:46:29.033 line:82%
Was bottled water a luxury item?

938
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.800 line:82%
The news talked about disharmony
between classes.

939
00:46:32.467 --> 00:46:34.400 line:82%
-Bottled water was like that.
-In 1991?

940
00:46:34.467 --> 00:46:36.900 line:82%
Think about how things were back in 1991.

941
00:46:36.967 --> 00:46:38.166 line:82%
Back in 1991?

942
00:46:38.667 --> 00:46:42.333 line:82%
Protecting water is akin
to protecting our lives.

943
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.433 line:82%
There is a mineral spring
that is busy all day long.

944
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.367 line:82%
INTEREST IN CLEAN WATER GROWS

945
00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:52.333 line:82%
WHAT KIND OF WATER IS GOOD
FOR THE BODY?

946
00:46:55.867 --> 00:46:57.300 line:82%
At a mineral spring by City Hall,

947
00:46:57.367 --> 00:47:01.000 line:82%
people who drove from Seoul
during the day in order to get water

948
00:47:01.066 --> 00:47:04.066 line:82%
are lined up with containers.

949
00:47:04.133 --> 00:47:06.033 line:82%
They say mineral water is good for you,

950
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:09.734 line:82%
so I'm bringing some home.

951
00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.367 line:82%
You need to be determined
to drink clean water.

952
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.533 line:82%
The Supreme Court will soon decide

953
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.100 line:82%
whether it's lawful to sell water.

954
00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:24.834 line:82%
In 1976, bottled water

955
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.667 line:82%
was first sold to American soldiers
in Korea.

956
00:47:26.734 --> 00:47:30.066 line:82%
After the 1986 Asian Games
and the 1988 Olympics,

957
00:47:30.133 --> 00:47:32.400 line:82%
the demand for bottled water
skyrocketed.

958
00:47:32.467 --> 00:47:35.567 line:82%
Everyone drinks it.
Many people in my apartment do.

959
00:47:35.633 --> 00:47:37.166 line:82%
When I began drinking bottled water,

960
00:47:37.233 --> 00:47:40.266 line:82%
I realized that it was good.
My family likes it too.

961
00:47:40.333 --> 00:47:42.300 line:82%
Although it was illegal
to sell bottled water,

962
00:47:42.367 --> 00:47:43.667 line:82%
no actions were taken.

963
00:47:43.734 --> 00:47:46.734 line:82%
As a result, there are
14 official bottled water companies

964
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.333 line:82%
and over 200 companies without a permit
in Korea.

965
00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.900 line:82%
…but it's too expensive.

966
00:47:51.967 --> 00:47:54.834 line:82%
It isn't gas. I don't understand
why it's so expensive.

967
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.300 line:82%
WATER IS PRICIER THAN GAS

968
00:47:56.367 --> 00:48:00.100 line:82%
The illegal distribution of bottled water
among the citizens is becoming widespread,

969
00:48:00.166 --> 00:48:02.133 line:82%
but the government is turning a blind eye.

970
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.834 line:82%
The officials are only having
an armchair argument regarding the matter.

971
00:48:08.066 --> 00:48:11.700 line:82%
In the '70s,
it was only sold to foreigners.

972
00:48:11.767 --> 00:48:15.300 line:82%
It's illegal distribution. That's
the resident representative's secret.

973
00:48:15.367 --> 00:48:18.033 line:82%
-Illegal distribution of bottled water?
-Was it a luxury item?

974
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.000 line:82%
Back then, people drank boiled water.

975
00:48:20.066 --> 00:48:21.433 line:82%
They didn't buy water.

976
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.800 line:82%
You're working hard on a cold day.

977
00:48:26.467 --> 00:48:27.700 line:82%
What's this?

978
00:48:30.834 --> 00:48:34.033 line:82%
It's unusual to have
so much bottled water at home.

979
00:48:35.667 --> 00:48:38.633 line:82%
Let's say bottled water is a luxury item.

980
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.233 line:82%
And she distributed it illegally.

981
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.600 line:82%
-I know. What…
-What about it?

982
00:48:43.667 --> 00:48:45.300 line:82%
What about it?

983
00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:48.567 line:82%
Seriously.

984
00:48:49.133 --> 00:48:49.967 line:82%
-I know.
-Seriously.

985
00:48:50.033 --> 00:48:52.834 line:82%
What do we have to do
with the illegal sales of bottled water?

986
00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.066 line:82%
-Please let go of your anger.
-Okay.

987
00:48:56.133 --> 00:49:00.233 line:82%
Why did the residents pass away
after drinking coffee?

988
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.500 line:82%
Well, they didn't pass away.

989
00:49:01.567 --> 00:49:03.300 line:82%
They were hospitalized.

990
00:49:04.367 --> 00:49:06.166 line:82%
It's based on a true event.

991
00:49:06.967 --> 00:49:10.233 line:82%
If it's a true event,
why did someone poison the drink?

992
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.967 line:82%
Was it done on purpose or not?

993
00:49:13.433 --> 00:49:15.400 line:82%
I'll visit the other unit.

994
00:49:16.066 --> 00:49:16.934 line:82%
Okay.

995
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.767 line:82%
You guys aren't scheming anything,
are you?

996
00:49:20.567 --> 00:49:22.867 line:82%
I'm not sure we have the skills
to do that.

997
00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:33.400 line:82%
JENNIE, we don't have time to sit around.

998
00:49:33.467 --> 00:49:37.200 line:82%
-Here's what I think.
-Okay.

999
00:49:37.266 --> 00:49:39.633 line:82%
-We can enjoy lunch…
-Yes.

1000
00:49:40.133 --> 00:49:42.066 line:82%
…and take our time with the deductions.

1001
00:49:43.633 --> 00:49:45.367 line:82%
Why are you saying that so suddenly?

1002
00:49:45.433 --> 00:49:46.667 line:82%
You're acting strange.

1003
00:49:47.734 --> 00:49:49.834 line:82%
What's up with you? Do you have a mission?

1004
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.467 line:82%
I just don't think we'll get
anything other than water at this point.

1005
00:49:53.533 --> 00:49:56.166 line:82%
Is there something you know?

1006
00:49:57.467 --> 00:50:00.633 line:82%
Let's go to unit 505
and figure out the clues.

1007
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.533 line:82%
Okay.

1008
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.633 line:82%
I'll follow you in a bit.

1009
00:50:06.967 --> 00:50:08.300 line:82%
This food is delicious.

1010
00:50:08.367 --> 00:50:10.934 line:82%
You said earlier that you were done.

1011
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.200 line:82%
It's really tasty.

1012
00:50:12.266 --> 00:50:16.233 line:82%
By behaving that way,
you're making yourself look like a spy.

1013
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.433 line:82%
-I'm not a spy.
-Why do you want to stay behind?

1014
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.900 line:82%
There's a piece of kimchi left,

1015
00:50:19.967 --> 00:50:22.767 line:82%
-so I'm going to eat it.
-What's up with her?

1016
00:50:22.834 --> 00:50:24.834 line:82%
She totally seems like…

1017
00:50:25.333 --> 00:50:28.166 line:82%
I'm going out even though I know
that you're suspicious,

1018
00:50:28.233 --> 00:50:29.300 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-Okay.

1019
00:50:29.367 --> 00:50:32.467 line:82%
I'm fully aware that you're a spy.

1020
00:50:33.033 --> 00:50:34.500 line:82%
-Come soon. Are you not coming?
-Okay.

1021
00:50:34.567 --> 00:50:36.133 line:82%
No, I'll go.

1022
00:50:37.333 --> 00:50:40.333 line:82%
JENNIE is… What's up with her?

1023
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.600 line:82%
It's tasty.

1024
00:51:00.266 --> 00:51:01.166 line:82%
I have it.

1025
00:51:01.233 --> 00:51:02.533 line:82%
-Enjoy the food.
-All right.

1026
00:51:05.233 --> 00:51:06.066 line:82%
Na-ra, there's meat.

1027
00:51:06.133 --> 00:51:07.934 line:82%
I wish I had dried seaweed.
It's tasty with it.

1028
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.433 line:82%
Are you enjoying the food?

1029
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.000 line:82%
-Yes.
-We just started eating.

1030
00:51:12.066 --> 00:51:13.500 line:82%
-We just had a bite.
-I see.

1031
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.767 line:82%
-There's nothing.
-Did you find anything?

1032
00:51:16.834 --> 00:51:18.300 line:82%
-No.
-All right.

1033
00:51:18.367 --> 00:51:20.300 line:82%
We just started eating.

1034
00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:23.934 line:82%
I have information to share.

1035
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.066 line:82%
Really?

1036
00:51:25.133 --> 00:51:27.333 line:82%
-It's important.
-What is it?

1037
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.233 line:82%
-JENNIE is…
-Okay.

1038
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.967 line:82%
-…a spy.
-Right?

1039
00:51:31.033 --> 00:51:32.734 line:82%
We knew it.

1040
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.367 line:82%
When I suggested coming to this unit
to find the clues,

1041
00:51:35.433 --> 00:51:39.200 line:82%
she said she'd enjoy the food first
since she knew everything.

1042
00:51:39.266 --> 00:51:40.300 line:82%
Where is she?

1043
00:51:40.367 --> 00:51:41.433 line:82%
She's in the unit alone.

1044
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.633 line:82%
She insisted on eating alone.

1045
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.200 line:82%
-I think she knows something.
-She knows something.

1046
00:51:46.266 --> 00:51:48.834 line:82%
-We did suspect her earlier.
-We did.

1047
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.767 line:82%
JENNIE is incredibly active today.

1048
00:51:50.834 --> 00:51:52.467 line:82%
I'll go and check up on her.

1049
00:51:52.533 --> 00:51:53.767 line:82%
Yes, check up on her.

1050
00:51:53.834 --> 00:51:56.200 line:82%
I'll do that.
She might be up to something.

1051
00:52:01.533 --> 00:52:05.133 line:82%
-In my opinion, Jae-seok is the spy today.
-Why?

1052
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.734 line:82%
Jae-seok hasn't played the role yet.

1053
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.834 line:82%
-We did suspect him earlier.
-It isn't you.

1054
00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.900 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-It isn't you.

1055
00:52:11.967 --> 00:52:13.967 line:82%
We did suspect Jae-seok earlier.

1056
00:52:14.033 --> 00:52:17.367 line:82%
That's why I'm leaving
the two of them alone.

1057
00:52:17.433 --> 00:52:20.367 line:82%
-I want to see what they'll do.
-Really?

1058
00:52:21.767 --> 00:52:23.600 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-I want to visit.

1059
00:52:26.567 --> 00:52:28.266 line:82%
Jung-ha, believe in your teammates.

1060
00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:30.567 line:82%
Believe in me and Na-ra.

1061
00:52:30.633 --> 00:52:31.533 line:82%
Okay.

1062
00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:42.133 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-Yes?

1063
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.567 line:82%
You're under suspicion.

1064
00:52:44.633 --> 00:52:45.567 line:82%
Me?

1065
00:52:45.633 --> 00:52:47.867 line:82%
For what? I didn't do anything suspicious.

1066
00:52:47.934 --> 00:52:49.467 line:82%
You didn't do anything suspicious?

1067
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.400 line:82%
-It's true.
-JENNIE.

1068
00:52:52.467 --> 00:52:53.900 line:82%
What do you know?

1069
00:52:53.967 --> 00:52:56.700 line:82%
Nothing. I know nothing.

1070
00:52:56.767 --> 00:52:58.567 line:82%
-You know something.
-No, I don't.

1071
00:52:58.633 --> 00:52:59.667 line:82%
Hurry up and spill.

1072
00:53:00.567 --> 00:53:02.133 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Yes?

1073
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.567 line:82%
You're going a bit overboard.

1074
00:53:04.567 --> 00:53:05.767 line:82%
It has been a while,

1075
00:53:05.834 --> 00:53:07.700 line:82%
-so I'm motivated.
-She's excited.

1076
00:53:07.767 --> 00:53:09.066 line:82%
We've all pretty much figured it out.

1077
00:53:09.133 --> 00:53:10.600 line:82%
-We have.
-Water.

1078
00:53:10.667 --> 00:53:12.700 line:82%
-We know it's about water.
-It's water.

1079
00:53:12.767 --> 00:53:15.467 line:82%
What does it have to do with poison?

1080
00:53:17.633 --> 00:53:19.100 line:82%
What's going on?

1081
00:53:19.166 --> 00:53:21.500 line:82%
-What's going on?
-What's the matter?

1082
00:53:21.567 --> 00:53:24.200 line:82%
Is there something wrong with my coffee?

1083
00:53:25.367 --> 00:53:29.266 line:82%
The resident representative was running
an illegal business in secret.

1084
00:53:29.333 --> 00:53:31.066 line:82%
One of the neighbors knew about it…

1085
00:53:31.133 --> 00:53:33.000 line:82%
They talked about disharmony.

1086
00:53:33.066 --> 00:53:36.500 line:82%
Did someone who couldn't get water get mad
and poison the drink?

1087
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.767 line:82%
What happened to the three boxes?

1088
00:53:39.834 --> 00:53:43.500 line:82%
Seriously. Someone might be moving
those three boxes.

1089
00:53:47.066 --> 00:53:49.000 line:82%
What? Who is it?

1090
00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.000 line:82%
Who is it?

1091
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.767 line:82%
-Hello.
-Detective.

1092
00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:59.166 line:82%
Hold on.

1093
00:53:59.233 --> 00:54:00.734 line:82%
Detective.

1094
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.166 line:82%
We're the police.
Who's the resident representative?

1095
00:54:04.233 --> 00:54:05.300 line:82%
-Detective?
-Hold on.

1096
00:54:05.367 --> 00:54:08.100 line:82%
I thought you might be curious,
so I came to share what we found out.

1097
00:54:08.166 --> 00:54:09.300 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

1098
00:54:09.367 --> 00:54:12.600 line:82%
The resident representative
has been cleared of the charge.

1099
00:54:12.667 --> 00:54:15.367 line:82%
-What?
-She's not connected to the incident?

1100
00:54:15.967 --> 00:54:18.400 line:82%
The resident representative
simply poured the coffee this morning.

1101
00:54:18.467 --> 00:54:21.934 line:82%
-Yes.
-She wasn't the one who made the coffee.

1102
00:54:29.166 --> 00:54:31.834 line:82%
-I see.
-We looked into the matter

1103
00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.533 line:82%
and found that there was nothing wrong
with the items she sold.

1104
00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.700 line:82%
-What?
-Nothing wrong?

1105
00:54:45.066 --> 00:54:46.300 line:82%
COFFEE - POSITIVE

1106
00:54:46.367 --> 00:54:47.600 line:82%
UNIT 505 WATER - NEGATIVE

1107
00:54:49.633 --> 00:54:52.667 line:82%
-She isn't the culprit.
-Then who is?

1108
00:54:52.734 --> 00:54:54.300 line:82%
-Who's the culprit?
-Who?

1109
00:54:54.367 --> 00:54:55.934 line:82%
We need to investigate further.

1110
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.033 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

1111
00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.033 line:82%
But what's important is this.

1112
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.400 line:82%
-On the collapsed residents' bodies…
-Yes, the three residents.

1113
00:55:02.467 --> 00:55:05.300 line:82%
…there were unusual blue rashes.

1114
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.967 line:82%
We believe that they've been poisoned.

1115
00:55:09.533 --> 00:55:12.200 line:82%
…there were unusual blue rashes.

1116
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.834 line:82%
-We've switched to an open investigation.
-Okay.

1117
00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.400 line:82%
If you happen to find the culprit…

1118
00:55:29.467 --> 00:55:30.900 line:82%
-One of us is the culprit.
-By 5 p.m…

1119
00:55:30.967 --> 00:55:34.266 line:82%
You'll see a police car
in front of the apartment.

1120
00:55:37.433 --> 00:55:38.700 line:82%
By 5 p.m…

1121
00:55:41.166 --> 00:55:42.900 line:82%
…put the culprit's belongings

1122
00:55:42.967 --> 00:55:45.000 line:82%
inside the police car
in front of apartment 108.

1123
00:55:48.967 --> 00:55:50.834 line:82%
The culprit's belongings?

1124
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.333 line:82%
Where is everyone?

1125
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.600 line:82%
Why? Where is everyone?

1126
00:55:53.667 --> 00:55:54.900 line:82%
-I'm looking.
-The eighth floor?

1127
00:55:58.433 --> 00:56:00.767 line:82%
Then we'll apprehend the culprit.

1128
00:56:03.133 --> 00:56:05.233 line:82%
If you put the culprit's belongings…

1129
00:56:11.867 --> 00:56:12.800 line:82%
Okay.

1130
00:56:14.367 --> 00:56:17.233 line:82%
Okay. The culprit's belongings. I got it.

1131
00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.967 line:82%
-Okay.
-My goodness.

1132
00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.133 line:82%
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

1133
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.233 line:82%
Salute.

1134
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.834 line:82%
-Salute.
-Salute.

1135
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.100 line:82%
-Salute.
-Unity.

1136
00:56:29.166 --> 00:56:30.533 line:82%
All right.

1137
00:56:31.433 --> 00:56:33.834 line:82%
So the resident representative
has been cleared.

1138
00:56:36.567 --> 00:56:40.066 line:82%
The residents collapsed upon drinking
the coffee you made.

1139
00:56:40.133 --> 00:56:41.266 line:82%
We received a report.

1140
00:56:42.166 --> 00:56:44.767 line:82%
We believe that they've been poisoned.

1141
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:50.700 line:82%
That means one of us might be the culprit.

1142
00:56:50.767 --> 00:56:53.066 line:82%
Among us…

1143
00:56:53.133 --> 00:56:56.033 line:82%
-Listen. There might be more than one.
-Yes.

1144
00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.800 line:82%
-No way.
-There might be two.

1145
00:56:57.867 --> 00:56:59.033 line:82%
It's one of us.

1146
00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:03.800 line:82%
No way. It's about time
Jae-seok played the role.

1147
00:57:03.867 --> 00:57:05.367 line:82%
-Hey, it isn't me.
-Jae-seok.

1148
00:57:05.433 --> 00:57:08.233 line:82%
-It's about time you played the role.
-It really is.

1149
00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.900 line:82%
Those glasses are
Jae-seok's only belongings.

1150
00:57:10.967 --> 00:57:13.033 line:82%
We can't take them off
because he'll be too ugly.

1151
00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.800 line:82%
He'll be too ugly.

1152
00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:19.467 line:82%
I'm curious about something.
In the video…

1153
00:57:19.533 --> 00:57:23.266 line:82%
Na-ra, when did you take
JENNIE's cute item?

1154
00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:25.367 line:82%
You're ruining it.

1155
00:57:25.433 --> 00:57:26.567 line:82%
I'm ruining it?

1156
00:57:26.633 --> 00:57:29.734 line:82%
-Aren't you a character from a fairy tale?
-What?

1157
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.934 line:82%
-The wolf.
-The wolf?

1158
00:57:32.633 --> 00:57:33.734 line:82%
It's fitting.

1159
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.367 line:82%
The wolf in
Little Red Riding Hood
.

1160
00:57:39.467 --> 00:57:42.066 line:82%
What kind of poison is it?

1161
00:57:42.133 --> 00:57:43.300 line:82%
What exactly is it?

1162
00:57:43.367 --> 00:57:44.967 line:82%
We don't know that.

1163
00:57:45.033 --> 00:57:47.166 line:82%
-It resulted in a blue rash.
-Toxins.

1164
00:57:47.233 --> 00:57:49.200 line:82%
-Copper sulfate.
-Copper sulfate?

1165
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.533 line:82%
-Copper sulfate?
-What?

1166
00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.934 line:82%
Who is it?

1167
00:57:55.233 --> 00:57:56.500 line:82%
-It's coming from the room.
-From the room.

1168
00:57:56.567 --> 00:57:58.700 line:82%
-What?
-It's a different sound.

1169
00:57:58.767 --> 00:57:59.934 line:82%
What is that sound?

1170
00:58:00.633 --> 00:58:01.533 line:82%
Is it…

1171
00:58:04.066 --> 00:58:05.200 line:82%
I'm scared.

1172
00:58:05.834 --> 00:58:07.700 line:82%
The sound is coming from the room.

1173
00:58:07.767 --> 00:58:09.166 line:82%
It sounds like construction.

1174
00:58:10.567 --> 00:58:13.333 line:82%
-Such sounds are so scary.
-That startled me.

1175
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.934 line:82%
-What's that sound?
-I don't know.

1176
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.000 line:82%
-A banging sound.
-What's this?

1177
00:58:18.066 --> 00:58:20.333 line:82%
-What?
-What's this?

1178
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.266 line:82%
See.

1179
00:58:22.233 --> 00:58:24.033 line:82%
-Don't do it.
-Don't do it.

1180
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.166 line:82%
-I can't believe you.
-Hey, JENNIE.

1181
00:58:26.233 --> 00:58:29.200 line:82%
I wanted to check
in case there was something.

1182
00:58:29.266 --> 00:58:31.367 line:82%
Why did sounds come from this room?

1183
00:58:32.266 --> 00:58:33.734 line:82%
What?

1184
00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.400 line:82%
Stop it. I'm really scared.

1185
00:58:35.467 --> 00:58:36.467 line:82%
What?

1186
00:58:37.734 --> 00:58:40.233 line:82%
What? Stop it. I'm really scared.

1187
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.467 line:82%
Stop it.

1188
00:58:41.533 --> 00:58:44.133 line:82%
-Stop it.
-What's going on?

1189
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.367 line:82%
-Blue light. What?
-What's this?

1190
00:58:47.433 --> 00:58:49.700 line:82%
-What's this on your clothes?
-What?

1191
00:58:49.767 --> 00:58:51.367 line:82%
-There's something.
-What's up with me?

1192
00:58:51.433 --> 00:58:53.000 line:82%
-What?
-What's up with you?

1193
00:58:53.066 --> 00:58:55.467 line:82%
Someone has been going around
smearing this on the members.

1194
00:58:55.533 --> 00:58:57.266 line:82%
-What's this?
-What's this?

1195
00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:59.567 line:82%
-Do I have it?
-You have it. You too.

1196
00:58:59.633 --> 00:59:03.500 line:82%
On the collapsed residents' bodies,
there were unusual blue rashes.

1197
00:59:03.567 --> 00:59:05.133 line:82%
-You have it.
-I do?

1198
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.834 line:82%
-It's on your neck.
-You have it.

1199
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.400 line:82%
You have it. It's no joke.

1200
00:59:08.467 --> 00:59:09.433 line:82%
-You have a lot.
-I have it.

1201
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.467 line:82%
-I have it.
-I have it.

1202
00:59:11.533 --> 00:59:13.066 line:82%
Mine is dark. What is it?

1203
00:59:13.133 --> 00:59:14.734 line:82%
Do I have it? I have it here.

1204
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.033 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-What?

1205
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.533 line:82%
Why is your face clear?

1206
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.200 line:82%
I have it on my body.

1207
00:59:20.266 --> 00:59:21.767 line:82%
-She has a lot.
-She has it.

1208
00:59:21.834 --> 00:59:24.300 line:82%
-Only JENNIE doesn't have it.
-Jung-ha is the same.

1209
00:59:24.367 --> 00:59:25.867 line:82%
-Jung-ha is the same.
-He has it.

1210
00:59:25.934 --> 00:59:27.233 line:82%
-He has it.
-He has it.

1211
00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.800 line:82%
-It's JENNIE.
-No.

1212
00:59:28.867 --> 00:59:31.367 line:82%
-JENNIE is the culprit.
-It's JENNIE.

1213
00:59:31.433 --> 00:59:33.100 line:82%
She has it.

1214
00:59:33.166 --> 00:59:35.900 line:82%
-It's invisible since my top is white.
-No, she has it.

1215
00:59:35.967 --> 00:59:38.133 line:82%
-JENNIE has it.
-She has it.

1216
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.533 line:82%
She has it.

1217
00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.400 line:82%
Hold on, Jae-seok. One of them put it

1218
00:59:47.467 --> 00:59:49.400 line:82%
on their own face.

1219
00:59:49.467 --> 00:59:50.900 line:82%
The culprit put it on their body.

1220
00:59:50.967 --> 00:59:52.166 line:82%
-Is it you?
-It isn't me.

1221
00:59:52.233 --> 00:59:53.867 line:82%
-It looks awkward.
-It isn't me.

1222
00:59:53.934 --> 00:59:55.900 line:82%
-Yours does look excessive.
-Whose?

1223
00:59:55.967 --> 00:59:57.667 line:82%
It looks like you put it on yourself.

1224
00:59:57.734 --> 00:59:59.800 line:82%
-You should've known.
-No.

1225
00:59:59.867 --> 01:00:03.700 line:82%
-Do you have it on your face?
-JENNIE, that's excessive too.

1226
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.633 line:82%
-But…
-These are blue rashes.

1227
01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:09.467 line:82%
These are blue rashes.

1228
01:00:09.533 --> 01:00:11.367 line:82%
-Right.
-These are blue rashes.

1229
01:00:11.433 --> 01:00:13.100 line:82%
The detective talked about them.

1230
01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:15.700 line:82%
On the collapsed residents' bodies,

1231
01:00:15.767 --> 01:00:18.567 line:82%
there were unusual blue rashes.

1232
01:00:18.633 --> 01:00:19.467 line:82%
Poison.

1233
01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.800 line:82%
Was there something we ate together?

1234
01:00:23.667 --> 01:00:25.734 line:82%
-You had soup, right?
-Yes.

1235
01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.734 line:82%
We had the kalguksu soup.

1236
01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:42.734 line:82%
-We were all poisoned.
-Did you eat it?

1237
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.100 line:82%
This is an announcement for the residents.

1238
01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:51.233 line:82%
Due to a problem with the generator,

1239
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.433 line:82%
the electricity got cut off,
and we had a momentary power outage.

1240
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.934 line:82%
The problem has been fixed,

1241
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.700 line:82%
so please be understanding.

1242
01:01:00.767 --> 01:01:02.500 line:82%
When was it smeared?

1243
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.867 line:82%
-Did we get a rash due to poison?
-Yes.

1244
01:01:05.934 --> 01:01:07.667 line:82%
We've already been poisoned.

1245
01:01:07.734 --> 01:01:09.166 line:82%
We got poisoned.

1246
01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:11.700 line:82%
Didn't we eat kalguksu together?

1247
01:01:11.767 --> 01:01:14.066 line:82%
I didn't eat kalguksu today.

1248
01:01:14.133 --> 01:01:15.333 line:82%
I didn't eat kalguksu.

1249
01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.767 line:82%
-Barley tea.
-I had some.

1250
01:01:16.834 --> 01:01:18.734 line:82%
I didn't eat anything in this unit.

1251
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.533 line:82%
You had coffee in the beginning.

1252
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.333 line:82%
So that's how I was poisoned.

1253
01:01:25.567 --> 01:01:27.533 line:82%
-There she goes again.
-Seriously.

1254
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.900 line:82%
-Hey, don't drink it.
-How does it taste?

1255
01:01:29.967 --> 01:01:31.367 line:82%
-It's good.
-Is it good?

1256
01:01:32.867 --> 01:01:34.333 line:82%
Do you mean the coffee from me?

1257
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.033 line:82%
-The two of you drank it.
-We drank coffee.

1258
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.900 line:82%
-I had noodles because of you.
-We had ramyeon.

1259
01:01:41.533 --> 01:01:43.166 line:82%
-Do you want to try it?
-Is it good?

1260
01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.333 line:82%
It's a bit salty.

1261
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.367 line:82%
-It's hot.
-The kalguksu is tasty.

1262
01:01:46.433 --> 01:01:47.567 line:82%
It's hot.

1263
01:01:47.633 --> 01:01:49.166 line:82%
It's a bit salty. Jung-ha made it.

1264
01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:55.867 line:82%
Why did you ask me to taste it?

1265
01:01:55.934 --> 01:01:58.200 line:82%
Didn't it taste good at that moment?

1266
01:01:58.266 --> 01:01:59.834 line:82%
Why did you ask me to taste it?

1267
01:02:03.066 --> 01:02:04.433 line:82%
Are you suspecting me?

1268
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.333 line:82%
I can speak to you with confidence.

1269
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.967 line:82%
Why did you ask me to try
the salty kalguksu?

1270
01:02:09.033 --> 01:02:10.667 line:82%
I'm not the culprit this time.

1271
01:02:10.734 --> 01:02:12.033 line:82%
They're cute.

1272
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.967 line:82%
-He asked you to try the salty kalguksu.
-"Why did you do that?"

1273
01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:17.166 line:82%
Why did you do that?

1274
01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:19.100 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-You're suspicious.

1275
01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:20.767 line:82%
-They're cute.
-They're cute.

1276
01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:23.000 line:82%
Testing.

1277
01:02:23.066 --> 01:02:25.800 line:82%
This is an announcement for the residents.

1278
01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:28.867 line:82%
-
A residential gathering will begin soon.
-It's about time.

1279
01:02:28.934 --> 01:02:32.100 line:82%
-
I ask every resident to come…
-All right.

1280
01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:33.767 line:82%
…to the Senior Center.

1281
01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:35.734 line:82%
-Let's go.
-That place.

1282
01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.266 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1283
01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:39.100 line:82%
When was it smeared on?

1284
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.233 line:82%
You have to keep suspecting someone.

1285
01:02:44.967 --> 01:02:47.900 line:82%
-You can't trust anyone.
-You can't trust anyone.

1286
01:02:47.967 --> 01:02:49.934 line:82%
-You can't trust…
-Anyone.

1287
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.200 line:82%
Where did Jung-ha go?

1288
01:02:53.467 --> 01:02:55.333 line:82%
Jung-ha is missing.

1289
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.233 line:82%
-Did Jung-ha leave?
-He's in the restroom.

1290
01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.300 line:82%
-I don't know.
-He's in the restroom.

1291
01:02:59.867 --> 01:03:02.233 line:82%
It's a hassle to wait.

1292
01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.734 line:82%
In any case, we need to put
the belongings in the police car.

1293
01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.900 line:82%
Tae-hyun, I'm just going to put Jung-ha
in the police car.

1294
01:03:08.967 --> 01:03:10.266 line:82%
Let's put in a person.

1295
01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:12.500 line:82%
If we take Jae-seok's glasses,

1296
01:03:12.567 --> 01:03:14.000 line:82%
what is he supposed to do?

1297
01:03:14.066 --> 01:03:16.567 line:82%
-Shall we take off his overalls?
-Socks.

1298
01:03:16.633 --> 01:03:18.233 line:82%
-We can cut his hair.
-Listen.

1299
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.100 line:82%
-We'll cut your hair.
-I'm not the culprit.

1300
01:03:21.166 --> 01:03:23.500 line:82%
-I'm not the culprit.
-When you weren't around,

1301
01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:27.333 line:82%
-Tae-hyun painted you as the culprit.
-He's the worst.

1302
01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.734 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-He pestered us.

1303
01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.300 line:82%
-I don't know what to do with him.
-I mean…

1304
01:03:32.367 --> 01:03:33.467 line:82%
Let's hurry to the gathering.

1305
01:03:33.533 --> 01:03:35.800 line:82%
-Mr. Residential Gathering.
-What was that?

1306
01:03:37.433 --> 01:03:39.367 line:82%
My goodness.

1307
01:03:39.934 --> 01:03:41.734 line:82%
I sat down like a middle-aged man.

1308
01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.200 line:82%
-Gosh.
-He's a middle-aged man.

1309
01:03:44.266 --> 01:03:46.400 line:82%
I'm getting nervous about the game.

1310
01:03:46.967 --> 01:03:49.200 line:82%
My team is kind of in trouble.

1311
01:03:49.266 --> 01:03:51.633 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-I have a bad feeling about this.

1312
01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.300 line:82%
-JENNIE, look at me.
-I have a bad feeling about this.

1313
01:03:54.367 --> 01:03:55.834 line:82%
What do you mean, "kind of"?

1314
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.266 line:82%
You'll play Liar Mafia.

1315
01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.667 line:82%
-Liar Mafia?
-Liar Mafia.

1316
01:04:00.734 --> 01:04:02.400 line:82%
Liar Mafia?

1317
01:04:02.467 --> 01:04:05.000 line:82%
-It's really easy.
-Really? Do you know the game?

1318
01:04:05.066 --> 01:04:08.333 line:82%
You'll each get a piece of paper
with a key word.

1319
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.600 line:82%
The five people who get the key word
are the civilians,

1320
01:04:10.667 --> 01:04:13.700 line:82%
and the one person who gets the star
is the mafia member.

1321
01:04:14.266 --> 01:04:17.333 line:82%
One at a time, you will make a sound,

1322
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.533 line:82%
do an action,

1323
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.967 line:82%
make a sound,

1324
01:04:20.033 --> 01:04:21.600 line:82%
and do an action.

1325
01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:23.166 line:82%
The civilians will describe the key word

1326
01:04:23.233 --> 01:04:25.300 line:82%
-so that the mafia member doesn't get it.
-Good.

1327
01:04:25.367 --> 01:04:27.166 line:82%
Even if the mafia member gets caught,

1328
01:04:27.233 --> 01:04:29.800 line:82%
if they figure out the key word,
they will win.

1329
01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:33.500 line:82%
We need to come up with sounds and actions
that'll fool the mafia member.

1330
01:04:33.567 --> 01:04:34.734 line:82%
We have to do an action?

1331
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.433 line:82%
-But don't make it obvious.
-No.

1332
01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:37.667 line:82%
An action or a sound?

1333
01:04:37.734 --> 01:04:38.967 line:82%
-We alternate.
-Either one.

1334
01:04:39.033 --> 01:04:40.400 line:82%
A, S, A, S.

1335
01:04:40.467 --> 01:04:43.467 line:82%
If you're the mafia member,
guess from other people's clues.

1336
01:04:43.533 --> 01:04:44.767 line:82%
What are A and S?

1337
01:04:44.834 --> 01:04:47.834 line:82%
-Action and sound.
-Why are you so nervous?

1338
01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.367 line:82%
He said, "A, S, A, S."

1339
01:04:50.433 --> 01:04:52.300 line:82%
Don't shorten the words.

1340
01:04:52.367 --> 01:04:53.600 line:82%
-A, S.
-Extend them.

1341
01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:56.533 line:82%
-Extend them? Actions and sounds.
-Okay.

1342
01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.800 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1343
01:04:57.867 --> 01:04:59.533 line:82%
-Good.
-A, S.

1344
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.800 line:82%
-Take one. It's random.
-Okay.

1345
01:05:02.867 --> 01:05:04.533 line:82%
I won't lose today.

1346
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.767 line:82%
Don't be ridiculous.

1347
01:05:16.467 --> 01:05:17.567 line:82%
-Okay.
-Let's begin.

1348
01:05:17.633 --> 01:05:19.633 line:82%
-Tae-hyun.
-Do I start?

1349
01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.133 line:82%
S, A, S, A, S, A.

1350
01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.700 line:82%
I'll twist it two times, okay? Two times.

1351
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.767 line:82%
Two times.

1352
01:05:27.633 --> 01:05:30.066 line:82%
If I make it obvious, the mafia will know.

1353
01:05:30.133 --> 01:05:32.100 line:82%
-You're flustered about going first.
-No.

1354
01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:35.600 line:82%
No. Listen, Jae-seok.

1355
01:05:35.667 --> 01:05:37.266 line:82%
-You're flustered about going first.
-No.

1356
01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:38.734 line:82%
No.

1357
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.000 line:82%
-We got you.
-No.

1358
01:05:40.066 --> 01:05:42.533 line:82%
-He became talkative.
-He became talkative.

1359
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.500 line:82%
I mean--

1360
01:05:45.867 --> 01:05:48.467 line:82%
-Hold on. Shall we start from there?
-Yes.

1361
01:05:48.533 --> 01:05:50.266 line:82%
-I should go first.
-Go first.

1362
01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:51.934 line:82%
Should I make it obvious or not?

1363
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.500 line:82%
-Make it obvious.
-Make it obvious.

1364
01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:56.834 line:82%
Hold on. The two of them asked me
to make it obvious.

1365
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.400 line:82%
-Okay.
-Make it obvious.

1366
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.900 line:82%
All right.

1367
01:06:05.967 --> 01:06:07.667 line:82%
-He did well.
-Action.

1368
01:06:07.734 --> 01:06:09.367 line:82%
Action?

1369
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.166 line:82%
All right. That's it.

1370
01:06:18.233 --> 01:06:19.767 line:82%
-I make a sound, right?
-Yes.

1371
01:06:19.834 --> 01:06:23.800 line:82%
Wow.

1372
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.333 line:82%
What was that? Tae-hyun.

1373
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.233 line:82%
-What was that?
-Wow.

1374
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.300 line:82%
-Let's reserve our judgment for now.
-Wow.

1375
01:06:30.367 --> 01:06:31.333 line:82%
-An action, right?
-Yes.

1376
01:06:32.467 --> 01:06:33.700 line:82%
Firstly…

1377
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.066 line:82%
That was perfect.

1378
01:06:40.133 --> 01:06:42.533 line:82%
-You know what it is, right?
-That was perfect.

1379
01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:03.066 line:82%
That was perfect.

1380
01:07:03.133 --> 01:07:05.367 line:82%
Tap.

1381
01:07:05.433 --> 01:07:07.100 line:82%
It's him.

1382
01:07:07.166 --> 01:07:08.500 line:82%
Do it again. What was that?

1383
01:07:08.567 --> 01:07:09.867 line:82%
-Hard, right?
-I missed it.

1384
01:07:09.934 --> 01:07:11.033 line:82%
"Hard, right?"

1385
01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.033 line:82%
-Tap.
-"Tap"?

1386
01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.867 line:82%
-My goodness.
-I see.

1387
01:07:14.934 --> 01:07:16.533 line:82%
Did you get it?

1388
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.633 line:82%
-"Tap"?
-Action.

1389
01:07:18.767 --> 01:07:20.133 line:82%
It's hard, right?

1390
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.233 line:82%
This is driving me crazy.

1391
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.400 line:82%
-Hold on. This is--
-My hint was too telling.

1392
01:07:28.467 --> 01:07:29.700 line:82%
Hold on.

1393
01:07:30.934 --> 01:07:33.333 line:82%
Let's see everything quickly. Ready, go.

1394
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.233 line:82%
-The mafia member figured it out.
-Look.

1395
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.300 line:82%
Isn't mine relatable?

1396
01:07:45.367 --> 01:07:46.333 line:82%
Wow.

1397
01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.567 line:82%
-It isn't that relatable.
-What?

1398
01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:51.233 line:82%
That could go with anything.

1399
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.166 line:82%
-Wow.
-From now on,

1400
01:07:53.233 --> 01:07:55.433 line:82%
I'll do it for every sound.

1401
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.967 line:82%
-Wow.
-I'll do it for every sound.

1402
01:07:58.033 --> 01:07:59.600 line:82%
Wow.

1403
01:07:59.667 --> 01:08:01.567 line:82%
It's a bit strange.

1404
01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:03.700 line:82%
Wow.

1405
01:08:03.767 --> 01:08:06.834 line:82%
-Let me answer. It's Na-ra.
-This is--

1406
01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:07.900 line:82%
Why do you think so?

1407
01:08:07.967 --> 01:08:09.367 line:82%
-Why?
-It isn't Na-ra.

1408
01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:10.800 line:82%
I'm a civilian.

1409
01:08:11.934 --> 01:08:13.467 line:82%
I'm a civilian.

1410
01:08:14.433 --> 01:08:15.433 line:82%
It isn't me.

1411
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.266 line:82%
-What did Na-ra do?
-Wait. That's right.

1412
01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:19.100 line:82%
-Do it again.
-Perhaps JENNIE figured it out.

1413
01:08:20.066 --> 01:08:23.033 line:82%
It isn't easy
to figure it out from one hint.

1414
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.867 line:82%
-She saw mine. Yes.
-She guessed from Se-chan's sound

1415
01:08:25.934 --> 01:08:28.567 line:82%
-and did something similar.
-She doesn't know what it is.

1416
01:08:28.633 --> 01:08:30.667 line:82%
-That's right.
-Right?

1417
01:08:30.734 --> 01:08:33.533 line:82%
Right? These two actions aren't guesswork.

1418
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.533 line:82%
Stop giving away hints.
Na-ra needs to guess now.

1419
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.400 line:82%
One, two, three.

1420
01:08:40.467 --> 01:08:41.867 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-JENNIE.

1421
01:08:41.934 --> 01:08:44.133 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Na-ra. It can't be helped.

1422
01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.467 line:82%
-It's JENNIE.
-Na-ra.

1423
01:08:45.533 --> 01:08:46.800 line:82%
Na-ra got the most votes. Na-ra.

1424
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.867 line:82%
-I'm the mafia member.
-See?

1425
01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:58.767 line:82%
-I'm the mafia member.
-See?

1426
01:08:58.834 --> 01:08:59.900 line:82%
-Really?
-She's good.

1427
01:08:59.967 --> 01:09:02.734 line:82%
-It was Na-ra.
-See, Se-chan?

1428
01:09:04.133 --> 01:09:06.033 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-JENNIE, you're incredible.

1429
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.600 line:82%
No, Na-ra doesn't know the key word.

1430
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.367 line:82%
-Ramyeon.
-See?

1431
01:09:16.433 --> 01:09:19.333 line:82%
-See?
-Look at that.

1432
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.367 line:82%
-Look at that.
-That's right.

1433
01:09:22.433 --> 01:09:24.400 line:82%
-The details were different.
-No?

1434
01:09:24.467 --> 01:09:27.000 line:82%
-That's right.
-I got it right.

1435
01:09:27.066 --> 01:09:29.200 line:82%
-Jjajangmyeon.
-That was dangerous.

1436
01:09:29.266 --> 01:09:30.333 line:82%
That was dangerous.

1437
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.300 line:82%
JENNIE had a clear idea.

1438
01:09:33.533 --> 01:09:37.200 line:82%
I knew what he was doing.
He gets the dish and goes, "Wow."

1439
01:09:37.266 --> 01:09:39.033 line:82%
You always do that on variety shows.

1440
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.633 line:82%
-Wow, it looks tasty.
-Wow.

1441
01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.834 line:82%
Wow, look at this. My goodness.

1442
01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.734 line:82%
-Wow.
-Wow.

1443
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.367 line:82%
"Wow" works for everything.

1444
01:09:48.433 --> 01:09:50.600 line:82%
-Wow.
-Next.

1445
01:09:50.667 --> 01:09:52.867 line:82%
If I get a sound, "Wow" is mine.

1446
01:09:53.533 --> 01:09:55.000 line:82%
Wow.

1447
01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:06.567 line:82%
-What?
-A, S, A, S, A, S.

1448
01:10:06.633 --> 01:10:08.200 line:82%
Will you twist it or not?

1449
01:10:08.767 --> 01:10:09.834 line:82%
I'll give it away.

1450
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.200 line:82%
-Okay.
-I'll make it obvious.

1451
01:10:15.567 --> 01:10:17.133 line:82%
That's right.

1452
01:10:18.867 --> 01:10:20.433 line:82%
That's right.

1453
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.433 line:82%
-That's right.
-Good.

1454
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.400 line:82%
Okay.

1455
01:10:23.467 --> 01:10:26.066 line:82%
Wow.

1456
01:10:26.633 --> 01:10:29.367 line:82%
-Wow.
-Hey.

1457
01:10:29.433 --> 01:10:31.266 line:82%
I don't know what to think of that.

1458
01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:32.834 line:82%
Wow.

1459
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.300 line:82%
-It's her.
-JENNIE.

1460
01:10:34.367 --> 01:10:36.467 line:82%
-It was too much.
-Wow.

1461
01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.600 line:82%
If I get a sound, "Wow" is mine.

1462
01:10:40.166 --> 01:10:41.567 line:82%
Shall I twist it or not?

1463
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.700 line:82%
Twist it no matter what.

1464
01:10:45.767 --> 01:10:47.834 line:82%
Shouldn't he make it obvious?

1465
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.400 line:82%
-Go ahead.
-It's confusing.

1466
01:10:49.467 --> 01:10:50.367 line:82%
Okay.

1467
01:10:52.033 --> 01:10:53.166 line:82%
Go ahead.

1468
01:11:05.567 --> 01:11:08.000 line:82%
My goodness.

1469
01:11:08.567 --> 01:11:10.867 line:82%
I think people will be confused.

1470
01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:13.333 line:82%
A sound.

1471
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.033 line:82%
Ding.

1472
01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.467 line:82%
Yes. That's right.

1473
01:11:18.533 --> 01:11:20.834 line:82%
Yes. That's right.

1474
01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.967 line:82%
Ding.

1475
01:11:22.033 --> 01:11:23.700 line:82%
Ding.

1476
01:11:23.767 --> 01:11:24.967 line:82%
-An action, right?
-Yes.

1477
01:11:25.033 --> 01:11:27.166 line:82%
Will you twist it or not?

1478
01:11:27.233 --> 01:11:29.433 line:82%
-I'll make it obvious.
-Okay.

1479
01:11:30.834 --> 01:11:31.767 line:82%
What?

1480
01:11:32.567 --> 01:11:35.500 line:82%
-What?
-That's right. That's…

1481
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.767 line:82%
-What?
-That's right. That's…

1482
01:11:38.834 --> 01:11:42.667 line:82%
That's… Hold on. From the reactions,

1483
01:11:42.734 --> 01:11:44.900 line:82%
I can tell who knows the key word.

1484
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.800 line:82%
-Jung-ha's eyes are shifting.
-I--

1485
01:11:47.867 --> 01:11:49.467 line:82%
No.

1486
01:11:52.633 --> 01:11:53.800 line:82%
All right.

1487
01:11:53.867 --> 01:11:56.133 line:82%
Hold on. What's this?

1488
01:11:56.967 --> 01:11:58.867 line:82%
-You're a civilian for sure.
-Yes.

1489
01:11:58.934 --> 01:12:00.967 line:82%
That's right. Maybe it's JENNIE.

1490
01:12:01.033 --> 01:12:02.934 line:82%
-"Wow" wasn't fitting.
-Wow.

1491
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.433 line:82%
You wouldn't say "Wow" to that.

1492
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.567 line:82%
I said "Wow" while looking at you.

1493
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.533 line:82%
-I think it's JENNIE.
-I think it's JENNIE.

1494
01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.533 line:82%
-One, two, three.
-I really-- Hold on.

1495
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.400 line:82%
-One, two, three.
-I really-- Hold on. Hear me out.

1496
01:12:15.467 --> 01:12:17.700 line:82%
-Guess the key word.
-Who do you think is the mafia member?

1497
01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:20.066 line:82%
-Here's what I think.
-Guess the key word.

1498
01:12:20.767 --> 01:12:23.166 line:82%
-Come on.
-We're on the same team. I'm a civilian.

1499
01:12:23.233 --> 01:12:25.100 line:82%
-The one I'm suspicious of--
-Who is it?

1500
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:27.500 line:82%
-The one I'm suspicious of--
-Who is it?

1501
01:12:28.767 --> 01:12:30.900 line:82%
You.

1502
01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.433 line:82%
Jae-seok, the gesture was cool.

1503
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.834 line:82%
She picks me when things are uncertain.

1504
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:38.600 line:82%
She picks me when things are uncertain.

1505
01:12:38.667 --> 01:12:41.967 line:82%
-This action was spot on.
-Listen.

1506
01:12:42.033 --> 01:12:43.700 line:82%
-It was spot on.
-It was too spot on.

1507
01:12:43.767 --> 01:12:44.900 line:82%
-Right.
-JENNIE.

1508
01:12:44.967 --> 01:12:48.667 line:82%
He was showing off
because he had figured it out.

1509
01:12:48.734 --> 01:12:50.400 line:82%
-You think he figured it out.
-Yes.

1510
01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:51.967 line:82%
All of us twisted it.

1511
01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:54.667 line:82%
-Go ahead.
-The two of you will take turns.

1512
01:12:55.734 --> 01:12:56.734 line:82%
JENNIE.

1513
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.333 line:82%
My sound is… Wow.

1514
01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:02.000 line:82%
I really am not the mafia member.

1515
01:13:02.066 --> 01:13:03.066 line:82%
Ding.

1516
01:13:03.133 --> 01:13:06.000 line:82%
-This is my action.
-It's spot on.

1517
01:13:06.567 --> 01:13:07.667 line:82%
Ta.

1518
01:13:08.233 --> 01:13:09.433 line:82%
-My goodness.
-Listen.

1519
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.800 line:82%
-Why don't you trust me this once?
-Okay.

1520
01:13:11.867 --> 01:13:14.033 line:82%
-Trust me this once.
-You're under pressure.

1521
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.967 line:82%
Seriously, it's Jae-seok.

1522
01:13:16.033 --> 01:13:17.734 line:82%
Me?

1523
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.233 line:82%
Mafia, be quiet.

1524
01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.734 line:82%
-One, two, three.
-We're on…

1525
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.934 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-JENNIE.

1526
01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:24.533 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-Do you feel victimized?

1527
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.834 line:82%
-I'm not the mafia member.
-No?

1528
01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.200 line:82%
-I'm not the mafia member.
-No?

1529
01:13:29.266 --> 01:13:31.133 line:82%
-What?
-No?

1530
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.867 line:82%
-No?
-It's Jae-seok.

1531
01:13:32.934 --> 01:13:34.400 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-No?

1532
01:13:34.467 --> 01:13:36.800 line:82%
It really isn't me.
JENNIE, it's not you?

1533
01:13:36.867 --> 01:13:38.867 line:82%
If you're the mafia member…

1534
01:13:38.934 --> 01:13:40.300 line:82%
-It really isn't me.
-No?

1535
01:13:40.367 --> 01:13:41.834 line:82%
-Then why did you do that?
-Is it Se-chan?

1536
01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.367 line:82%
-Is it Se-chan?
-It isn't me.

1537
01:13:43.433 --> 01:13:45.300 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-Then who is it?

1538
01:13:45.367 --> 01:13:47.133 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-Then who is it?

1539
01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.200 line:82%
-Is it you?
-It isn't me.

1540
01:13:49.266 --> 01:13:51.934 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-Then who is it? Is it you?

1541
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.166 line:82%
It isn't me.

1542
01:13:55.266 --> 01:13:56.800 line:82%
Is it this man? Is it?

1543
01:13:56.867 --> 01:13:58.700 line:82%
-That came out wrong.
-Is it you?

1544
01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:01.066 line:82%
-It's you, isn't it?
-It has to be you.

1545
01:14:01.133 --> 01:14:04.200 line:82%
I'm the mafia member, okay?

1546
01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.800 line:82%
-No way.
-No way.

1547
01:14:07.867 --> 01:14:10.100 line:82%
-How did he manage that?
-What did you do?

1548
01:14:10.166 --> 01:14:12.567 line:82%
-JENNIE, I'm sorry.
-JENNIE.

1549
01:14:12.633 --> 01:14:15.333 line:82%
-Why did you do that?
-Why did you say, "Wow"?

1550
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.233 line:82%
-Why did you do that?
-As I said it,

1551
01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:19.367 line:82%
-I moved my head.
-"Wow" wasn't fitting.

1552
01:14:19.433 --> 01:14:21.100 line:82%
I wanted to do this. "Wow."

1553
01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.934 line:82%
-I…
-JENNIE.

1554
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.967 line:82%
What's the key word?

1555
01:14:25.033 --> 01:14:27.600 line:82%
-Wait, I'm confused.
-You're unbelievable.

1556
01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:28.800 line:82%
What is it? Hurry up and answer.

1557
01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:32.333 line:82%
-Revolving door?
-What?

1558
01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.600 line:82%
Washing machine.

1559
01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.533 line:82%
-You spun.
-No way.

1560
01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.934 line:82%
Na-ra did this.

1561
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.266 line:82%
I said I'd twist it, so I did this.

1562
01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:43.400 line:82%
People seemed to accept that,
so I thought, "Okay."

1563
01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:49.033 line:82%
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

1564
01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:52.200 line:82%
I thought you were imitating a top loader.

1565
01:14:52.266 --> 01:14:53.533 line:82%
-No way.
-Seriously.

1566
01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.100 line:82%
-Revolving door.
-You were brave.

1567
01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:56.800 line:82%
-The Yus won.
-Yes.

1568
01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.600 line:82%
This is our game.
Jae-seok, we found our game.

1569
01:15:01.667 --> 01:15:04.000 line:82%
The losing team gets a clue too.

1570
01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.333 line:82%
-Really?
-Don't share the clue.

1571
01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.700 line:82%
Shall we go?

1572
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.500 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Do we go back?

1573
01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.834 line:82%
You mafia.

1574
01:15:12.233 --> 01:15:13.633 line:82%
Jae-seok has his eyes on me.

1575
01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.100 line:82%
LOOK AT THE CLUB IN UNIT 504

1576
01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:19.166 line:82%
-Not the stars?
-I guess there's something else.

1577
01:15:19.934 --> 01:15:22.834 line:82%
-Where is my shoelace?
-Why is it missing?

1578
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:25.200 line:82%
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1579
01:15:25.266 --> 01:15:27.333 line:82%
-What?
-Someone took my shoelace.

1580
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.900 line:82%
Someone took your shoelace.

1581
01:15:28.967 --> 01:15:30.567 line:82%
Really?

1582
01:15:30.633 --> 01:15:31.834 line:82%
It's too much.

1583
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.200 line:82%
Someone took my shoelace.

1584
01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.467 line:82%
By 5 p.m.,

1585
01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.333 line:82%
put the culprit's belongings

1586
01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.266 line:82%
inside the police car
in front of apartment 108.

1587
01:15:41.767 --> 01:15:43.600 line:82%
-Unbelievable.
-When did it happen?

1588
01:15:43.667 --> 01:15:45.667 line:82%
-My shoelace.
-That's so funny.

1589
01:15:45.734 --> 01:15:47.800 line:82%
-Did you do it?
-I didn't do it.

1590
01:15:47.867 --> 01:15:49.934 line:82%
-Come here, Se-chan.
-I didn't do it.

1591
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.834 line:82%
-It must be you.
-I really didn't do it.

1592
01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.900 line:82%
-It's you, right?
-It has to be Tae-hyun.

1593
01:15:53.967 --> 01:15:55.734 line:82%
I can't believe these punks.

1594
01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.100 line:82%
-Where did my shoelace go?
-I was waiting for 5 p.m.

1595
01:15:58.166 --> 01:16:00.333 line:82%
-Can we do it now?
-His shoelace was taken.

1596
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.633 line:82%
-Gosh.
-When was it taken?

1597
01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.500 line:82%
Tae-hyun, bring my shoelace.

1598
01:16:04.567 --> 01:16:05.600 line:82%
-It really wasn't me.
-Jae-seok.

1599
01:16:05.667 --> 01:16:07.767 line:82%
-Bring it while I'm asking nicely.
-Shoelace.

1600
01:16:07.834 --> 01:16:09.867 line:82%
-Hey.
-I feel so bad for you.

1601
01:16:09.934 --> 01:16:11.633 line:82%
I can't believe my shoelace went missing.

1602
01:16:19.734 --> 01:16:23.800 line:82%
By 5 p.m.,
put the culprit's belongings

1603
01:16:23.867 --> 01:16:25.100 line:82%
inside the police car.

1604
01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:29.233 line:82%
That means one of us might be the culprit.

1605
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.166 line:82%
Let's check the clue. Is it another video?

1606
01:16:35.233 --> 01:16:36.367 line:82%
It's a video.

1607
01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.166 line:82%
JENNIE, close the door.

1608
01:16:39.233 --> 01:16:41.233 line:82%
-I closed it.
-Those punks play so dirty.

1609
01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:45.934 line:82%
Gosh, those punks took my hat.

1610
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.700 line:82%
They took everything.

1611
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.667 line:82%
Those punks came in here

1612
01:16:51.734 --> 01:16:53.500 line:82%
and took everything.

1613
01:16:57.133 --> 01:16:59.500 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-I can't believe them.

1614
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.600 line:82%
Look at this. Look at this, Jae-seok.

1615
01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:05.100 line:82%
-What does it say?
-Look. Who is…

1616
01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:06.567 line:82%
-What does it say?
-Look.

1617
01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.100 line:82%
For "who," it says, "Unit 504, club."

1618
01:17:12.934 --> 01:17:14.800 line:82%
-What?
-Who…

1619
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.934 line:82%
The clue to who did it is in unit 504.

1620
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.967 line:82%
For "what"… What's this?
"Pi,
he…"

1621
01:17:32.033 --> 01:17:34.633 line:82%
-What?
-
"Pi,
he, number one."

1622
01:17:36.934 --> 01:17:39.100 line:82%
Do you think
pi
is the English letter P?

1623
01:17:39.166 --> 01:17:40.367 line:82%
-Hold on. What's that?
-P.

1624
01:17:40.934 --> 01:17:44.100 line:82%
What are the two missing letters? P…

1625
01:17:44.166 --> 01:17:45.667 line:82%
"Phone number"?

1626
01:17:45.734 --> 01:17:47.133 line:82%
-What's this?
-"Phone number"?

1627
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.300 line:82%
"Pi,
he, no…"

1628
01:17:48.367 --> 01:17:50.600 line:82%
Letters would go in the blanks.

1629
01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:54.066 line:82%
I thought it was "phone,"
but then it should be "ph."

1630
01:17:55.233 --> 01:17:56.300 line:82%
Let's play it.

1631
01:18:03.233 --> 01:18:05.100 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1632
01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:07.233 line:82%
-Come on.
-Come on.

1633
01:18:08.633 --> 01:18:11.467 line:82%
-Come on.
-Come on.

1634
01:18:11.533 --> 01:18:14.166 line:82%
You guys should know better than that.

1635
01:18:14.233 --> 01:18:15.633 line:82%
I can't believe them.

1636
01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.600 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-All right.

1637
01:18:17.667 --> 01:18:19.233 line:82%
Give us Jae-seok's shoe.

1638
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.367 line:82%
Give us Jae-seok's shoe with the shoelace.

1639
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.233 line:82%
Seriously, don't come here.

1640
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.333 line:82%
-All right.
-Seriously.

1641
01:18:28.834 --> 01:18:31.367 line:82%
-All right.
-Seriously.

1642
01:18:33.033 --> 01:18:34.033 line:82%
Take out an insole.

1643
01:18:34.967 --> 01:18:36.867 line:82%
-There's no insole.
-An insole.

1644
01:18:37.834 --> 01:18:40.000 line:82%
-I can't take out the insole.
-Really?

1645
01:18:43.033 --> 01:18:44.567 line:82%
Close the door.

1646
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.033 line:82%
All right.

1647
01:18:52.734 --> 01:18:54.500 line:82%
THE 1ST
KBS COLLEGE COMEDY FESTIVAL

1648
01:18:54.567 --> 01:18:55.734 line:82%
College Comedy Festival
?

1649
01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.266 line:82%
It's contestant number nine.

1650
01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.200 line:82%
From Seoul Institute of the Arts…

1651
01:18:59.266 --> 01:19:00.467 line:82%
-Is that you?
-Yes.

1652
01:19:00.533 --> 01:19:02.266 line:82%
That's you. You're unmistakable.

1653
01:19:02.333 --> 01:19:03.533 line:82%
Congratulations.

1654
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.767 line:82%
Why did they make it so obvious?
Jae-seok must be embarrassed.

1655
01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:08.467 line:82%
He must be flustered.

1656
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:13.233 line:82%
Let's watch a scene
from a popular commercial.

1657
01:19:13.934 --> 01:19:17.233 line:82%
-My mom can cook well.
-It's so boring.

1658
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.300 line:82%
She makes many tasty dishes.

1659
01:19:19.367 --> 01:19:21.467 line:82%
-It's so boring.
-Is it from 1991?

1660
01:19:21.533 --> 01:19:23.834 line:82%
-It's from 1991. I was a college freshman.
-Really?

1661
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.500 line:82%
Mom, isn't it true?

1662
01:19:26.567 --> 01:19:27.734 line:82%
Yes. Go ahead and eat.

1663
01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.233 line:82%
It's…

1664
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.133 line:82%
What?

1665
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.967 line:82%
Can I have more?

1666
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.400 line:82%
What?

1667
01:19:39.367 --> 01:19:40.767 line:82%
What was the line?

1668
01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:43.567 line:82%
Did you say that it was rotten?

1669
01:19:48.467 --> 01:19:50.266 line:82%
In Daegu, foul-smelling…

1670
01:19:50.333 --> 01:19:52.333 line:82%
kept the citizens from doing the laundry.

1671
01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.100 line:82%
It happened because of…

1672
01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:56.633 line:82%
About 2 g is a lethal amount…

1673
01:19:57.934 --> 01:20:02.600 line:82%
As it reacts with other chemicals,
its odor and toxicity intensify.

1674
01:20:03.133 --> 01:20:05.066 line:82%
It builds up in living organisms

1675
01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:09.567 line:82%
and causes pulmonary edema,
muscular paralysis, and cancer.

1676
01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.800 line:82%
Due to the stench,
people began purchasing bottled water.

1677
01:20:18.767 --> 01:20:21.767 line:82%
Hey, that's the news.

1678
01:20:25.734 --> 01:20:27.867 line:82%
It's…

1679
01:20:27.934 --> 01:20:29.633 line:82%
About 2 g is a lethal amount…

1680
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.233 line:82%
…people began purchasing bottled water.

1681
01:20:34.967 --> 01:20:37.900 line:82%
It was all over the news. Phenol.

1682
01:20:39.433 --> 01:20:40.967 line:82%
Phenol?

1683
01:20:41.967 --> 01:20:44.900 line:82%
Phenol. It was called
the Phenol Incident of 1991.

1684
01:20:49.367 --> 01:20:52.533 line:82%
Foul-smelling tap water
kept the citizens…

1685
01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.900 line:82%
It happened because of phenol spillage

1686
01:20:54.967 --> 01:20:57.767 line:82%
into the reservoir of the Nakdong River.

1687
01:21:03.867 --> 01:21:05.600 line:82%
It was revealed

1688
01:21:05.667 --> 01:21:08.633 line:82%
that wastewater containing phenol
was dumped into the Nakdong River.

1689
01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:11.734 line:82%
The tap water quickly became contaminated
with phenol.

1690
01:21:16.467 --> 01:21:19.066 line:82%
It was all over the news. Phenol.

1691
01:21:19.133 --> 01:21:21.433 line:82%
That was why I made that skit.

1692
01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.600 line:82%
It's phenol milk.

1693
01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:26.400 line:82%
Can I have more?

1694
01:21:28.767 --> 01:21:32.400 line:82%
Then those letters must be
a chemical symbol.

1695
01:21:41.367 --> 01:21:43.867 line:82%
Back then, people boiled barley tea.

1696
01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.000 line:82%
Barley tea is tasty.

1697
01:21:47.066 --> 01:21:48.967 line:82%
Hey, don't drink it.

1698
01:21:52.834 --> 01:21:54.367 line:82%
-It's hot.
-The kalguksu is tasty.

1699
01:21:58.367 --> 01:21:59.900 line:82%
-Blue light.
-What's this?

1700
01:21:59.967 --> 01:22:01.600 line:82%
-What?
-What's this on your clothes?

1701
01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:03.300 line:82%
-There's something.
-What?

1702
01:22:04.834 --> 01:22:07.000 line:82%
Meanwhile, the company
behind the phenol incident was identified.

1703
01:22:07.066 --> 01:22:10.700 line:82%
Meanwhile, the company
behind the phenol incident was identified.

1704
01:22:10.767 --> 01:22:14.333 line:82%
It was further revealed
that the insiders of the company

1705
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.433 line:82%
attempted to cover up the incident.

1706
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.700 line:82%
Is that so?

1707
01:22:17.767 --> 01:22:19.166 line:82%
The insiders.

1708
01:22:19.767 --> 01:22:21.500 line:82%
The company insider

1709
01:22:21.567 --> 01:22:24.767 line:82%
instigated A to put the blame
on the resident representative

1710
01:22:24.834 --> 01:22:28.233 line:82%
who sold bottled water illegally
at an apartment

1711
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:31.033 line:82%
by making the phenol incident
look like a poisoning case.

1712
01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.133 line:82%
The revelation shocked everyone.

1713
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.667 line:82%
-Are there no problems?
-Today, there are no…

1714
01:22:39.734 --> 01:22:41.367 line:82%
-What?
-What's going on?

1715
01:22:41.433 --> 01:22:43.734 line:82%
I simply gave them coffee
since the weather was cold.

1716
01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.467 line:82%
Don't accuse an innocent woman.

1717
01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.233 line:82%
While the police
have gotten a hold of the insider,

1718
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.667 line:82%
A's whereabouts remain unknown.

1719
01:22:56.734 --> 01:22:59.266 line:82%
The police are after A
in an open investigation.

1720
01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:13.000 line:82%
-You put the blame on the woman.
-You put the blame on her.

1721
01:23:13.066 --> 01:23:15.066 line:82%
The police are after you, Jae-seok.

1722
01:23:15.133 --> 01:23:16.300 line:82%
It isn't me.

1723
01:23:16.367 --> 01:23:18.400 line:82%
-It has to be you.
-Hey.

1724
01:23:18.967 --> 01:23:20.800 line:82%
This is an announcement.

1725
01:23:21.533 --> 01:23:25.233 line:82%
From 4:30 to 5 p.m.,

1726
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.934 line:82%
you can bring the belongings
of the person you think is A

1727
01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.333 line:82%
to the police car.

1728
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.333 line:82%
The first person to put A's belongings
in the car

1729
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.900 line:82%
will win.

1730
01:23:37.967 --> 01:23:42.400 line:82%
However, you only have two chances
to put the belongings inside.

1731
01:23:42.467 --> 01:23:45.567 line:82%
If you fail to catch A
in the two chances you have

1732
01:23:45.633 --> 01:23:49.100 line:82%
or fail to identify them by 5 p.m.,

1733
01:23:49.166 --> 01:23:50.867 line:82%
the residents will lose.

1734
01:23:50.934 --> 01:23:53.734 line:82%
So please choose carefully.

1735
01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.567 line:82%
We have to choose carefully.

1736
01:24:02.834 --> 01:24:04.333 line:82%
Where is the club?

1737
01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.200 line:82%
LOOK AT THE CLUB IN UNIT 504

1738
01:24:09.967 --> 01:24:12.500 line:82%
We're here.

1739
01:24:12.567 --> 01:24:15.467 line:82%
My goodness,
I thought it was the detective.

1740
01:24:15.533 --> 01:24:17.367 line:82%
We're here.

1741
01:24:17.433 --> 01:24:20.467 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-We're here.

1742
01:24:20.533 --> 01:24:21.600 line:82%
We're here.

1743
01:24:21.667 --> 01:24:23.600 line:82%
-What were you watching?
-Hey.

1744
01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:25.967 line:82%
Hey.

1745
01:24:26.033 --> 01:24:27.767 line:82%
I don't know which one of you did it,

1746
01:24:27.834 --> 01:24:29.734 line:82%
but you need to stop

1747
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.467 line:82%
taking my items from my bag.

1748
01:24:33.066 --> 01:24:36.300 line:82%
…you need to stop
taking my items from my bag.

1749
01:24:36.367 --> 01:24:37.934 line:82%
Why did you take my fur hat?

1750
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.200 line:82%
It wasn't me. It really wasn't.

1751
01:24:39.266 --> 01:24:40.266 line:82%
Who was it?

1752
01:24:40.333 --> 01:24:41.367 line:82%
Who took my fur hat?

1753
01:24:41.934 --> 01:24:44.200 line:82%
-Se-chan.
-It wasn't me.

1754
01:24:44.266 --> 01:24:46.600 line:82%
Jae-seok, it wasn't me. I don't have it.

1755
01:24:46.667 --> 01:24:48.166 line:82%
Jae-seok, where is the club?

1756
01:24:48.233 --> 01:24:51.166 line:82%
Hold on. Let's talk
now that everyone is here.

1757
01:24:51.233 --> 01:24:52.200 line:82%
-Okay.
-Sounds good.

1758
01:24:52.266 --> 01:24:56.100 line:82%
What's the mission of the day?
In the police car…

1759
01:24:56.166 --> 01:24:57.033 line:82%
The culprit's--

1760
01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:59.100 line:82%
We put in Jae-seok's belongings, right?

1761
01:24:59.166 --> 01:25:01.200 line:82%
I'm not the culprit.

1762
01:25:01.266 --> 01:25:02.967 line:82%
-Is that what we need to do?
-Yes.

1763
01:25:03.033 --> 01:25:04.700 line:82%
-We need to do it first.
-First.

1764
01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:07.266 line:82%
The first one to do it becomes the winner.

1765
01:25:07.333 --> 01:25:09.233 line:82%
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

1766
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.734 line:82%
That's what we need to do.

1767
01:25:13.734 --> 01:25:14.600 line:82%
First…

1768
01:25:15.567 --> 01:25:16.900 line:82%
-Na-ra, you came late.
-Is that it?

1769
01:25:16.967 --> 01:25:18.200 line:82%
Where?

1770
01:25:27.633 --> 01:25:28.767 line:82%
An airplane.

1771
01:25:32.967 --> 01:25:34.667 line:82%
There's only one. There it is.

1772
01:25:34.734 --> 01:25:36.567 line:82%
An airplane.

1773
01:25:41.934 --> 01:25:42.934 line:82%
An airplane.

1774
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:43.934 line:82%
All right.

1775
01:25:47.734 --> 01:25:49.033 line:82%
-An airplane.
-An airplane.

1776
01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:50.800 line:82%
-Light aircraft.
-What does it mean?

1777
01:25:50.867 --> 01:25:52.667 line:82%
Seriously, what does it mean?

1778
01:25:52.734 --> 01:25:55.233 line:82%
A glider. Light aircraft.

1779
01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:01.734 line:82%
-Light aircraft.
-Light aircraft.

1780
01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.367 line:82%
What's this?

1781
01:26:03.433 --> 01:26:05.066 line:82%
-Come here.
-Okay.

1782
01:26:06.467 --> 01:26:08.700 line:82%
-There are three clubs.
-Three?

1783
01:26:08.767 --> 01:26:11.166 line:82%
There are three.
This one and the two airplanes.

1784
01:26:13.033 --> 01:26:17.400 line:82%
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE

1785
01:26:17.467 --> 01:26:19.300 line:82%
"You can't see
what's right under your nose"?

1786
01:26:21.433 --> 01:26:23.300 line:82%
-What was your hint?
-Did you see this?

1787
01:26:23.367 --> 01:26:24.433 line:82%
What? No.

1788
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:25.667 line:82%
All right.

1789
01:26:32.033 --> 01:26:33.300 line:82%
It's the character for "woods."

1790
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.266 line:82%
Jae-seok, hold on.

1791
01:26:35.333 --> 01:26:37.433 line:82%
-The woods.
-What?

1792
01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:43.667 line:82%
Tell me. I'm so frustrated.

1793
01:26:43.734 --> 01:26:47.700 line:82%
Tell me. I'm so frustrated. Seriously.

1794
01:26:47.767 --> 01:26:49.233 line:82%
What is it? Tell me.

1795
01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.800 line:82%
Se-chan, we're sharing information.
I'll tell you later.

1796
01:26:52.867 --> 01:26:55.500 line:82%
-Be serious.
-Okay.

1797
01:26:56.467 --> 01:26:57.834 line:82%
Will you share information?

1798
01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:01.200 line:82%
-I'll tell you.
-The hint is a toxic substance.

1799
01:27:01.266 --> 01:27:02.400 line:82%
-Toxic substance?
-Really?

1800
01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.700 line:82%
Yes. The hint is a toxic substance.

1801
01:27:04.767 --> 01:27:09.467 line:82%
We just got "The so-and-so Incident."
It's the name of the toxic substance.

1802
01:27:09.533 --> 01:27:11.834 line:82%
"The so-and-so Incident"?

1803
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:13.967 line:82%
-Beef shank.
-"Beef shank"?

1804
01:27:14.533 --> 01:27:16.834 line:82%
-It rhymes with incident.
-Jae-seok…

1805
01:27:17.767 --> 01:27:19.033 line:82%
What's up with your shoes?

1806
01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.900 line:82%
Jae-seok, what's up with your shoes?

1807
01:27:20.967 --> 01:27:22.900 line:82%
-It's hip-hop.
-Jae-seok.

1808
01:27:22.967 --> 01:27:24.300 line:82%
It's hip-hop.

1809
01:27:27.567 --> 01:27:30.200 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-I believe you.

1810
01:27:30.266 --> 01:27:33.000 line:82%
But if you walk around like that,
you'll look like the culprit.

1811
01:27:33.066 --> 01:27:34.233 line:82%
You look so cute.

1812
01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.133 line:82%
It isn't me.

1813
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.734 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-Yes?

1814
01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.166 line:82%
It really wasn't me.

1815
01:27:39.233 --> 01:27:41.700 line:82%
It really wasn't me.
Don't corner me like this.

1816
01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:44.367 line:82%
-It wasn't you, was it?
-It really wasn't me.

1817
01:27:45.734 --> 01:27:47.667 line:82%
-But--
-What could that mean?

1818
01:27:47.734 --> 01:27:49.200 line:82%
Isn't it Jae-seok?

1819
01:27:49.266 --> 01:27:51.567 line:82%
-Why would that mean Jae-seok?
-I mean…

1820
01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:54.266 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-Yes?

1821
01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:57.133 line:82%
Tae-hyun, while there's a chance
of Jae-seok being the culprit…

1822
01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.600 line:82%
It'll be a disaster if it isn't him.

1823
01:27:59.667 --> 01:28:01.934 line:82%
Seriously. We just need to solve
this clue.

1824
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:17.100 line:82%
Let's take out all the shoelaces.

1825
01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:18.633 line:82%
Which one do you want?

1826
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.867 line:82%
For now, I don't know who the culprit is.
So I'm getting all the shoelaces.

1827
01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:34.867 line:82%
-Why do you keep stealing?
-What?

1828
01:28:34.934 --> 01:28:36.667 line:82%
I need the belongings.

1829
01:28:39.934 --> 01:28:41.500 line:82%
You're taking the whole bag?

1830
01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:43.633 line:82%
-Will you carry it?
-Let's do that.

1831
01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.567 line:82%
I don't think it's Na-ra.

1832
01:28:45.633 --> 01:28:46.967 line:82%
You never know.

1833
01:28:47.033 --> 01:28:49.266 line:82%
If you guess wrong,
you need another belonging.

1834
01:28:49.333 --> 01:28:50.934 line:82%
-We only get two chances.
-Yes.

1835
01:28:51.934 --> 01:28:53.000 line:82%
Hold on.

1836
01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.900 line:82%
Jae-seok, someone took my shoe.

1837
01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:01.700 line:82%
Hey, you punks.

1838
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000 line:82%
Come here.

1839
01:29:04.567 --> 01:29:08.000 line:82%
You should've left my shoe behind.
Why did you take it?

1840
01:29:08.066 --> 01:29:11.400 line:82%
-I can't believe them.
-This isn't the way to do it.

1841
01:29:12.734 --> 01:29:14.066 line:82%
What?

1842
01:29:14.133 --> 01:29:16.200 line:82%
Someone took a shoe.

1843
01:29:16.266 --> 01:29:18.100 line:82%
This is wrong.

1844
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.467 line:82%
This is wrong.

1845
01:29:22.033 --> 01:29:23.967 line:82%
There's only a pair of slippers.

1846
01:29:24.033 --> 01:29:25.567 line:82%
-Is that it?
-That's right.

1847
01:29:25.633 --> 01:29:27.166 line:82%
-Is that it?
-That's right.

1848
01:29:27.233 --> 01:29:29.033 line:82%
What's the connection?

1849
01:29:38.834 --> 01:29:41.433 line:82%
-Does it refer to this part?
-Yes.

1850
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:44.633 line:82%
What is it? A button? What is it called?

1851
01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:48.300 line:82%
-A dial. Does it have to do with planes?
-I don't know.

1852
01:29:48.367 --> 01:29:50.567 line:82%
"Right under your nose"?

1853
01:29:50.633 --> 01:29:53.066 line:82%
-Is that a clue?
-Yes, it's in the other room.

1854
01:29:53.133 --> 01:29:55.066 line:82%
-Really?
-And there's a drawing.

1855
01:29:55.133 --> 01:29:56.834 line:82%
-A drawing?
-A drawing in a sketchbook.

1856
01:29:58.433 --> 01:30:00.133 line:82%
"Right under your nose."

1857
01:30:01.567 --> 01:30:03.133 line:82%
JENNIE, where is my shoe?

1858
01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.200 line:82%
-Se-chan, I'm…
-What is it?

1859
01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:10.300 line:82%
What could be the hint here?

1860
01:30:10.367 --> 01:30:12.800 line:82%
The culprit… It isn't you, is it?

1861
01:30:12.867 --> 01:30:15.700 line:82%
It isn't me. I'm walking around like this
since my shoe is gone.

1862
01:30:15.767 --> 01:30:17.700 line:82%
I'm walking around like this.

1863
01:30:17.767 --> 01:30:21.000 line:82%
I'm walking around like this
since my shoe is gone.

1864
01:30:21.066 --> 01:30:22.500 line:82%
I'm walking around like this.

1865
01:30:22.567 --> 01:30:23.667 line:82%
-Really?
-It isn't me.

1866
01:30:23.734 --> 01:30:25.166 line:82%
Let's solve the clue then.

1867
01:30:25.233 --> 01:30:27.900 line:82%
-You think that means glasses?
-I don't think so.

1868
01:30:27.967 --> 01:30:29.800 line:82%
Glasses and crooked teeth.

1869
01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.633 line:82%
That can't be it.

1870
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.600 line:82%
What could it be?

1871
01:30:35.133 --> 01:30:37.367 line:82%
What's the meaning of
"Right under your nose"?

1872
01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:38.900 line:82%
Right under your nose.

1873
01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:41.033 line:82%
There's one on the TV?

1874
01:30:45.967 --> 01:30:48.600 line:82%
Three?

1875
01:30:48.667 --> 01:30:50.867 line:82%
Panel. Button.

1876
01:30:50.934 --> 01:30:51.767 line:82%
Dial.

1877
01:30:52.934 --> 01:30:54.567 line:82%
Three
ieungs?

1878
01:30:58.500 --> 01:30:59.533 line:82%
Wait.

1879
01:31:00.633 --> 01:31:02.800 line:82%
Jung-ha? Lee Jung-ha?

1880
01:31:02.867 --> 01:31:06.800 line:82%
LEE JUNG-HA

1881
01:31:06.867 --> 01:31:09.033 line:82%
There's an airplane here too.

1882
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:12.834 line:82%
MOVING

1883
01:31:17.433 --> 01:31:20.900 line:82%
-Why isn't Jung-ha here?
-I'm not sure.

1884
01:31:21.533 --> 01:31:23.133 line:82%
Where did Jung-ha go?

1885
01:31:23.867 --> 01:31:25.300 line:82%
Jung-ha is missing.

1886
01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.100 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-Yes?

1887
01:31:31.166 --> 01:31:32.500 line:82%
It really wasn't me.

1888
01:31:32.567 --> 01:31:34.967 line:82%
It really wasn't me.
Don't corner me like this.

1889
01:31:36.867 --> 01:31:39.467 line:82%
Na-ra, Jung-ha is A.

1890
01:31:39.533 --> 01:31:40.367 line:82%
Gosh.

1891
01:31:41.567 --> 01:31:43.000 line:82%
Did everyone go down?

1892
01:31:44.233 --> 01:31:45.066 line:82%
Where is he?

1893
01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.533 line:82%
Where is he?

1894
01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.500 line:82%
Did you go downstairs?

1895
01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:06.367 line:82%
Where is the police car?

1896
01:32:07.734 --> 01:32:09.066 line:82%
Did they really go?

1897
01:32:09.133 --> 01:32:10.133 line:82%
Did they really go?

1898
01:32:12.567 --> 01:32:16.200 line:82%
Na-ra, that's my phone.
Na-ra, it isn't me.

1899
01:32:16.266 --> 01:32:19.133 line:82%
It isn't me. I'm serious.

1900
01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.166 line:82%
I know who the culprit is.

1901
01:32:22.233 --> 01:32:23.767 line:82%
It isn't me.

1902
01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.600 line:82%
Where is the police car?

1903
01:32:37.467 --> 01:32:38.834 line:82%
Where is the police car?

1904
01:32:40.166 --> 01:32:42.533 line:82%
Where is the police car? The police car.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.667 line:82%
It isn't me.

1906
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.600 line:82%
What? Someone is running.

1907
01:32:56.333 --> 01:32:57.667 line:82%
Where is the police car?

1908
01:32:57.734 --> 01:32:58.767 line:82%
What is it?

1909
01:33:01.567 --> 01:33:02.667 line:82%
I'm exhausted.

1910
01:33:03.734 --> 01:33:05.033 line:82%
All right.

1911
01:33:08.066 --> 01:33:09.333 line:82%
It's Lee Jung-ha's.

1912
01:33:13.467 --> 01:33:15.700 line:82%
Why isn't Jung-ha here?

1913
01:33:19.667 --> 01:33:23.333 line:82%
LEE JUNG-HA

1914
01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.500 line:82%
Lee Jung-ha…

1915
01:33:35.633 --> 01:33:37.533 line:82%
Lee Jung-ha isn't the culprit.

1916
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.600 line:82%
-He's not?
-No.

1917
01:33:40.533 --> 01:33:42.400 line:82%
Lee Jung-ha isn't the culprit.

1918
01:33:42.467 --> 01:33:43.400 line:82%
-He's not?
-No.

1919
01:33:43.467 --> 01:33:45.100 line:82%
Jae-seok!

1920
01:33:46.667 --> 01:33:48.266 line:82%
-It isn't him.
-It isn't him.

1921
01:33:48.333 --> 01:33:50.000 line:82%
-No?
-I told you so.

1922
01:33:50.066 --> 01:33:52.166 line:82%
Jae-seok, it isn't Jung-ha.

1923
01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:56.800 line:82%
We only have one chance left.
Gosh, I can't believe him.

1924
01:33:56.867 --> 01:33:58.734 line:82%
I thought it was Jung-ha, but I was wrong.

1925
01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.800 line:82%
I thought it was Jung-ha, but I was wrong.

1926
01:34:10.633 --> 01:34:11.867 line:82%
You're right.

1927
01:34:19.066 --> 01:34:20.600 line:82%
Is there another one?

1928
01:34:25.166 --> 01:34:29.033 line:82%
KOREAN BEEF IS
THE BEST KIND OF BEEF

1929
01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.033 line:82%
"Korean beef is the best kind of beef."

1930

-Tae-hyun.
-Yes?

1943
01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:07.200 line:82%
-I figured it out.
-What?

1944
01:35:07.266 --> 01:35:09.233 line:82%
What kind of a plane is that?

1945
01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.166 line:82%
-A paper plane.
-No, a light aircraft.

1946

-A light aircraft.
-A light aircraft.

1947
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.500 line:82%
It sounds similar to "security guard."

1948
01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.633 line:82%
It sounds similar to "security guard."

1949

on the resident representative

1960
01:36:02.467 --> 01:36:05.000 line:82%
by making the phenol incident
look like a poisoning case.

1961
01:36:05.066 --> 01:36:07.266 line:82%
The police are after "A"
in an open investigation.

1962
01:36:19.266 --> 01:36:21.266 line:82%
You're working hard on a cold day.

People boiled tap water.

They made corn tea and barley tea
in a kettle at home.

1970

You're right.

1971
01:37:06.266 --> 01:37:07.533 line:82%
Should I try it or not?

1972
01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.433 line:82%
Hey, that isn't what's important.

1973
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:13.667 line:82%
-It's Woo-il.
-It's Woo-il.

1974

What about the clubs?

1975
01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:18.333 line:82%
The airplane. How is that related to him?

-Where is he?

1977

-Security guard.
-Security guard?

1978
01:37:22.834 --> 01:37:24.433 line:82%
-A light aircraft.
-Really?

1979
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.667 line:82%

Let's hurry.

1982
01:37:39.533 --> 01:37:40.667 line:82%
How far do I need to go?

1983
01:37:46.767 --> 01:37:49.567 line:82%
-I should've taken the elevator.
-What are you doing here?

1984
01:37:49.633 --> 01:37:52.700 line:82%
-I should've taken the elevator.

1985
01:37:52.767 --> 01:37:53.900 line:82%
-The rooftop?
-No.

1986
01:37:53.967 --> 01:37:55.533 line:82%
-Isn't he there?
-No.

1987
01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.400 line:82%
-Did you find him?
-No.

1988
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.967 line:82%
-He isn't here. Was I mistaken?
-No.

1989
01:38:01.233 --> 01:38:03.033 line:82%
He isn't here. Let's go.

1990
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.900 line:82%
Where is Woo-il hiding?

1991
01:38:06.967 --> 01:38:08.567 line:82%
That's right.

1992
01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:10.367 line:82%
Hey, Na-ra.

1993
01:38:10.433 --> 01:38:12.667 line:82%
-Yes? How about the bull?
-Take your bag.

1994
01:38:12.734 --> 01:38:14.734 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1995
01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.867 line:82%
-How about the bull?
-Take your bag.

1996
01:38:16.934 --> 01:38:18.433 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1997
01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:21.400 line:82%
I can't believe it.

1998
01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:24.166 line:82%
Seriously.

1999
01:38:24.233 --> 01:38:27.200 line:82%
Where did my shoelaces go?

2000
01:38:27.266 --> 01:38:30.600 line:82%
JENNIE, here you go.

2001
01:38:30.667 --> 01:38:32.667 line:82%
At least you only lost your shoelaces.

2002
01:38:32.734 --> 01:38:34.900 line:82%
I lost my shoes.

2003

2006
01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:46.333 line:82%
Woo-il. Where is the security guard?

2007

Where is Im Woo-il?

2008
01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:51.700 line:82%
Why is it so dark here?

2009
01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.266 line:82%
There's no way he's here.

2010
01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:56.834 line:82%
The basement is empty.

2011
01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:58.967 line:82%
Woo-il, you aren't hiding, are you?

2012
01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:00.900 line:82%

2067
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.667 line:82%
I thought we were a team,

2068
01:43:11.734 --> 01:43:13.433 line:82%
so I shared what I knew.

2069
01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:14.734 line:82%
It was an individual event.

2070
01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:16.700 line:82%

01:43:20.166 --> 01:43:23.300 line:82%
Today's story was based
on the Phenol Incident from 1991.

2073
01:43:23.367 --> 01:43:24.367 line:82%
That's right.

2074
01:43:24.433 --> 01:43:27.033 line:82%

and doing the laundry.

2085
01:43:52.166 --> 01:43:54.066 line:82%
A direct cause
of the drinking water crisis was

2086
01:43:54.133 --> 01:43:57.934 line:82%
the unethical tendency of a corporation
that only chased after profit.

2087
01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.834 line:82%
An electronics company
that claimed to collect

old electronics to preserve nature

2089
01:44:03.166 --> 01:44:07.600 line:82%

Factories that were secretly discarding
chemical-laden wastewater

2091
01:44:11.367 --> 01:44:12.934 line:82%
were caught.

2092
01:44:21.834 --> 01:44:23.567 line:82%
-Stop right there!
-Stop, you punk!

2093
01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.166 line:82%
Love isn't a sin!

2094
01:44:29.133 --> 01:44:31.333 line:82%
Have you seen this man?

2095
01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.467 line:82%
He's someone precious to me.

2096
01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:36.500 line:82%
Don't worry. We'll find him.

2097
01:44:36.567 --> 01:44:38.033 line:82%
A hint will give me an idea.

2098
01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.734 line:82%
He was called Heung-bu.

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:41.400 line:82%

2102
01:44:46.633 --> 01:44:48.000 line:82%
Move out of the way!

2103
01:44:52.967 --> 01:44:55.433 line:82%
-I'm so scared.
-It was like a movie.
