159
00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:31.867 line:82%
-
If that's what you think…
-It was called the Western cigarette.

160
00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:33.533 line:82%
It was prohibited.

161
00:08:34.834 --> 00:08:36.834 line:82%
Coffee. Was coffee not allowed?

162
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.533 line:82%
Was coffee smuggled back then?

163
00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:42.000 line:82%
Smugglers should see
the error of their ways

164
00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:45.367 line:82%
and accompany the great journey
to economic independence.

165
00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:49.133 line:82%
Smuggling.

166
00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:53.633 line:82%
So smugglers are running rampant here.

167
00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:57.600 line:82%
Operations to eradicate smuggling
are taking place.

168
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.367 line:82%
They're the selfish individuals
who smuggle goods for personal gain.

169
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.533 line:82%
I'm the cane of the people, right?

170
00:09:09.834 --> 00:09:11.633 line:82%
I need to catch them, right?

171
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.100 line:82%
This is scary.

172
00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:22.500 line:82%
-"Let's begin the labor"?
-So I need to work.

173
00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:24.233 line:82%
"Let's begin the labor"?

174
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.667 line:82%
Testing, testing.

175
00:09:29.734 --> 00:09:33.133 line:82%
All members, please come outside.

176
00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:38.433 line:82%
All members, please come outside.

177
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.533 line:82%
Mr. Security Guard.

178
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.767 line:82%
-Mr. Security Guard.
-Please come outside.

179
00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:44.400 line:82%
Hello.

180
00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:46.367 line:82%
Mister.

181
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.967 line:82%
-What's this?
-Seriously. What's this?

182
00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:51.200 line:82%
Is this a construction site?

183
00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:52.800 line:82%
-All right.
-What's this?

184
00:09:57.633 --> 00:09:58.633 line:82%
What's this?

185
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.734 line:82%
-The scale is no joke, right?
-Yes, it's no joke.

186
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.433 line:82%
This is
Apartment404
.

187
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.633 line:82%
-What's this?
-What?

188
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.700 line:82%
-How cute. There's a set.
-What?

189
00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:23.233 line:82%
What could this be?

190
00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:25.333 line:82%
I hear something.

191
00:10:25.934 --> 00:10:29.100 line:82%
-Look over there.
-Na-ra.

192
00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:30.433 line:82%
It's Saemaul Undong.

193
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.100 line:82%
Look over there.

194
00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:33.100 line:82%
Na-ra.

195
00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:35.600 line:82%
-It's Saemaul Undong.
-I can't believe it.

196
00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:39.567 line:82%
What's this?

197
00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:41.166 line:82%
Why do I know this song?

198
00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:42.533 line:82%
-You do, right?
-I know it.

199
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.200 line:82%
Hey, this song…

200
00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:47.734 line:82%
The morning bell has rung
And a new day has begun

201
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.967 line:82%
We can sing along.

202
00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:51.934 line:82%
-And a new day has begun
-And a new day has begun

203
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.300 line:82%
-Let us rise
-Let us rise

204
00:10:54.367 --> 00:10:56.834 line:82%
-I know this song.
-
And build a new village

205
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.066 line:82%
-
My livable
-What?

206
00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:02.333 line:82%
Isn't that Woo-il?

207
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.567 line:82%
Is that Woo-il?

208
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.500 line:82%
Congratulations.

209
00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:12.000 line:82%
You've been invited to Saemaul Plan.

210
00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:15.233 line:82%
Why was his voice distorted?
We can see his face clearly.

211
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.333 line:82%
This is the Maple Apartment
construction site.

212
00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:28.734 line:82%
Firstly, you'll be divided into teams.

213
00:11:29.867 --> 00:11:32.667 line:82%
They will be Team Traders
and Team Public Officials.

214
00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.467 line:82%
-Two teams.
-It's a team competition.

215
00:11:34.533 --> 00:11:36.567 line:82%
I want to be a public official.

216
00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:39.233 line:82%
-
Team Traders consists of Se-chan
…
-Me.

217
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.934 line:82%
…
Na-ra, and YEONJUN.

218
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.166 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

219
00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:46.433 line:82%
Team Public Officials consist

220
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.066 line:82%
-
of Mayor Jae-seok
…
-I'm the mayor?

221
00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:49.567 line:82%
…
Police JENNIE,

222
00:11:49.633 --> 00:11:51.734 line:82%
-
and Customs Official Tae-hyun.
-Police?

223
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.166 line:82%
Jae-seok!

224
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.166 line:82%
I'm the mayor.

225
00:12:01.233 --> 00:12:03.734 line:82%
-Hey.
-We're a team.

226
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.500 line:82%
-I'm the mayor.
-Mr. Mayor.

227
00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:07.300 line:82%
-I'm the mayor.
-You're the mayor?

228
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.033 line:82%
The secret of the apartment
will be revealed

229
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.533 line:82%
when you complete the bingo board
with 25 squares in front of you.

230
00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:18.500 line:82%
-The bingo board.
-We need to complete it.

231
00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:22.233 line:82%
There are 25 spaces

232
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.400 line:82%
with various sums of money and conditions.

233
00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:28.600 line:82%
Once the construction
of the Maple Apartments begins

234
00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:32.000 line:82%
you'll have six hours
until the end of construction.

235
00:12:32.066 --> 00:12:34.767 line:82%
If all 25 spaces get filled,

236
00:12:35.367 --> 00:12:37.133 line:82%
Team Traders will win.

237
00:12:37.767 --> 00:12:39.000 line:82%
-All of them.
-We must fill them.

238
00:12:39.066 --> 00:12:41.400 line:82%
-The team that fills more…
-All of these spaces.

239
00:12:42.033 --> 00:12:45.033 line:82%
If Team Traders is stopped

240
00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:47.767 line:82%
and fails to fill all 25 spaces in time,

241
00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:50.667 line:82%
Team Public Officials will win.

242
00:12:51.266 --> 00:12:52.667 line:82%
-We stop them.
-We're the ones

243
00:12:52.734 --> 00:12:53.800 line:82%
-who stop them.
-Yes.

244
00:12:53.867 --> 00:12:56.700 line:82%
-We need to stop you guys.
-We're confident.

245
00:12:56.767 --> 00:13:01.100 line:82%
Team Traders will find the items
near the apartment complex

246
00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:04.433 line:82%
that match the conditions
of the bingo spaces.

247
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.800 line:82%
An item with a name
I can say correctly five times.

248
00:13:07.567 --> 00:13:08.700 line:82%
Choco Pie.

249
00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:11.033 line:82%
Choco Pie, Choco Pie.

250
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.100 line:82%
All right. Choco Pie.

251
00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:15.367 line:82%
Once you get a pass
from the public official,

252
00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:19.300 line:82%
you can win the allotted money.

253
00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:21.500 line:82%
-You need to find something.
-Yes.

254
00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:23.533 line:82%
We need to bring these items.

255
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.900 line:82%
If the customs official

256
00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:28.667 line:82%
finds an item
that doesn't match the condition,

257
00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:32.834 line:82%
he will fine you 10,000 won
and send the item back.

258
00:13:34.567 --> 00:13:36.367 line:82%
How nice.

259
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.233 line:82%
What should I do?

260
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.667 line:82%
It's 10,000 won.

261
00:13:40.734 --> 00:13:42.400 line:82%
If Team Traders gets caught

262
00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:45.066 line:82%
by the police or the mayor…

263
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.400 line:82%
they must pay a fine of 10,000 won
and return the item.

264
00:13:51.467 --> 00:13:52.367 line:82%
Thank you.

265
00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:56.100 line:82%
…they must pay a fine of 10,000 won
and return the item.

266
00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:57.633 line:82%
This is…

267
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.900 line:82%
-Gosh.
-They'll take all the money.

268
00:14:01.567 --> 00:14:05.433 line:82%
I forgot to share
the most important detail.

269
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.867 line:82%
The members of the winning team

270
00:14:08.467 --> 00:14:10.800 line:82%
will receive the actual money

271
00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:13.600 line:82%
they collected throughout the mission.

272
00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:17.900 line:82%
-Gosh, that's incredible.
-Ten times?

273
00:14:17.967 --> 00:14:19.266 line:82%
Ten times?

274
00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.166 line:82%
-Oh, yes.
-That's nice.

275
00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:23.834 line:82%
Among the members of the losing team,

276
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.233 line:82%
the one who collected the most money

277
00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:30.000 line:82%
will receive it in cash.

278
00:14:31.734 --> 00:14:32.700 line:82%
My goodness.

279
00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:33.900 line:82%
-It's an individual game.
-Yes.

280
00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:37.000 line:82%
-This one is.
-It's both a team and individual game.

281
00:14:37.066 --> 00:14:40.567 line:82%
The game will begin with a siren.

282
00:14:40.633 --> 00:14:44.033 line:82%
I ask you to join forces and work hard.

283
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.066 line:82%
This game is totally…

284
00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:52.066 line:82%
-My goodness.
-It's grand.

285
00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:53.600 line:82%
The scale is on another level.

286
00:14:54.667 --> 00:14:56.500 line:82%
-You've heard the rules.
-Yes.

287
00:14:56.567 --> 00:14:59.800 line:82%
Since you're bad at explaining,
they film it ahead of time now.

288
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.000 line:82%
Well done.

289
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.433 line:82%
I'll catch you.

290
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.734 line:82%
I won't get caught.

291
00:15:08.734 --> 00:15:10.767 line:82%
We need to put them on, right?

292
00:15:10.834 --> 00:15:12.266 line:82%
Yes, put the armbands on.

293
00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:14.533 line:82%
The apartment will be built now.

294
00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:17.300 line:82%
Na-ra, put on the gloves.

295
00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:19.700 line:82%
-I brought them.
-Did you bring them?

296
00:15:20.633 --> 00:15:22.500 line:82%
Na-ra, wear these string-knit gloves.

297
00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:24.300 line:82%
-It's okay.
-These are warmer.

298
00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:25.767 line:82%
-Give them here.
-It's okay.

299
00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:27.867 line:82%
-These are warmer.
-For goodness' sake.

300
00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:29.467 line:82%
You're making my heart flutter.

301
00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:31.700 line:82%
I'm okay with these.
You should wear warm gloves.

302
00:15:31.767 --> 00:15:33.734 line:82%
-Are you flirting?
-Don't be ridiculous.

303
00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:38.100 line:82%
Just because I gave Na-ra these gloves,
she went, "Are you flirting?"

304
00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:40.500 line:82%
-You're flirting, you punk.
-No.

305
00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:41.633 line:82%
You should wear warm gloves.

306
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.500 line:82%
-Don't go for a difficult love.
-Okay.

307
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.633 line:82%
"Don't go for a difficult love."

308
00:15:46.367 --> 00:15:48.667 line:82%
You're pretending to be in your thirties.

309
00:15:48.734 --> 00:15:50.066 line:82%
Don't go for a painful love.

310
00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:53.433 line:82%
I'll give you 100,000 won each.

311
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.734 line:82%
One, two…

312
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.100 line:82%
-I'll catch them nonstop.
-…three, four…

313
00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:01.033 line:82%
That's how we make money.

314
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.300 line:82%
-Yes.
-We're confident. Today,

315
00:16:03.367 --> 00:16:05.667 line:82%
we have the quick YEONJUN

316
00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:08.400 line:82%
-and the cunning Se-chan.
-Yes.

317
00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.133 line:82%
Looking forward to working with you.

318
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.300 line:82%
-Okay.
-Nice to meet you.

319
00:16:11.367 --> 00:16:14.667 line:82%
-I'll make a lot of money today.
-Okay.

320
00:16:14.734 --> 00:16:16.600 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.

321
00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:19.300 line:82%
-Do well, YEONJUN.
-See you soon.

322
00:16:19.367 --> 00:16:20.633 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Na-ra, let's go.

323
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.900 line:82%
They can't catch me.

324
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.033 line:82%
"An item you can ride."

325
00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:36.233 line:82%
A traffic cone. I can ride it.

326
00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.467 line:82%
I can't ride it.

327
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.967 line:82%
You can run well, right?

328
00:16:47.033 --> 00:16:48.533 line:82%
I'm pretty quick.

329
00:16:51.033 --> 00:16:53.066 line:82%
Tiger's energy, come to me.

330
00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:55.467 line:82%
Mount Suri's energy.

331
00:16:57.166 --> 00:16:58.834 line:82%
Ride the bike around
and chase the traders.

332
00:16:59.567 --> 00:17:00.934 line:82%
Let JENNIE ride on the back.

333
00:17:02.033 --> 00:17:03.533 line:82%
-Okay. There you go.
-Okay.

334
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.533 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Team Public Officials, let's go.

335
00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:08.834 line:82%
For round one,
the time limit is 20 minutes.

336
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.300 line:82%
-
It begins now.
-Here we go.

337
00:17:11.367 --> 00:17:12.633 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Now…

338
00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:16.734 line:82%
-Here she comes. Na-ra.
-Here she comes.

339
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.700 line:82%
-Here comes a trader.
-Hey.

340
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.467 line:82%
My goodness.

341
00:17:21.233 --> 00:17:23.533 line:82%
-I haven't even gotten started.
-What?

342
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.400 line:82%
You got a bicycle?

343
00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:28.133 line:82%
We'll walk around as well.
Let's keep it here for now.

344
00:17:28.767 --> 00:17:31.166 line:82%
I'm innocent. I don't have anything on me.

345
00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:34.000 line:82%
-Don't you have something?
-Have a good day.

346
00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:37.000 line:82%
-Don't you have something? Okay.
-No. The round just started.

347
00:17:37.066 --> 00:17:39.567 line:82%
-Have a good day.
-Hold on. I need to find Se-chan.

348
00:17:41.767 --> 00:17:43.700 line:82%
Okay. Gosh, there's a rice cooker.

349
00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:45.767 line:82%
What's the brand?

350
00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:48.200 line:82%
I bet it's 40 years old.

351
00:17:51.533 --> 00:17:53.000 line:82%
Was this made in Korea?

352
00:17:53.066 --> 00:17:55.066 line:82%
MADE IN KOREA

353
00:17:55.133 --> 00:17:58.600 line:82%
Hold on. I won't take this one. Hold on.

354
00:17:58.667 --> 00:18:01.367 line:82%
A spicy item. A shiny item.
An item that can hold food.

355
00:18:01.433 --> 00:18:04.100 line:82%
An item that can hold food, 50,000 won.
Here it is.

356
00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:06.834 line:82%
Can I take two items at once? Just one?

357
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.367 line:82%
-Okay.
-I'll put it on.

358
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.033 line:82%
I can go now, right? Let's go.

359
00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.600 line:82%
So this is how it works.

360
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.500 line:82%
Hold on.

361
00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:27.967 line:82%
Let's look for the hidden items.

362
00:18:33.567 --> 00:18:35.700 line:82%
An item that's 10 to 15 kg?
I don't think so.

363
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.200 line:82%
An item you can hold with one hand
for ten seconds or longer?

364
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.433 line:82%
Two, three, four,

365
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.667 line:82%
five, six, seven, eight…

366
00:18:45.734 --> 00:18:46.667 line:82%
I can do it.

367
00:18:51.367 --> 00:18:52.567 line:82%
What? It's JENNIE.

368
00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:57.767 line:82%
I feel like I'm going to school.

369
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.834 line:82%
Hello.

370
00:19:16.734 --> 00:19:20.533 line:82%
I see that you're holding something.

371
00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:24.567 line:82%
Se-chan, you have the delivery sticker.
Let's go.

372
00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:27.200 line:82%
Let's run.

373
00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.433 line:82%
-JENNIE, hold on.
-Okay. Let's talk.

374
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.967 line:82%
JENNIE, stay there.

375
00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:35.166 line:82%
I don't care
if my team wins or loses today.

376
00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:37.967 line:82%
Gosh, you startled me.

377
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.100 line:82%
I don't care
if my team wins or loses today.

378
00:19:42.734 --> 00:19:43.834 line:82%
Gosh, you startled me.

379
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.734 line:82%
YEONJUN is running.

380
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.467 line:82%
Hey!

381
00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:55.433 line:82%
Gosh, his legs are too long.

382
00:19:56.533 --> 00:19:57.600 line:82%
Gosh.

383
00:19:57.667 --> 00:19:59.767 line:82%
-What?
-Hey, YEONJUN.

384
00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:01.633 line:82%
Hey, YEONJUN.

385
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.600 line:82%
Come here.

386
00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:06.333 line:82%
Oh, no.

387
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.767 line:82%
Even if you run,
you won't have anywhere to go.

388
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.633 line:82%
Running won't get you far.

389
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.533 line:82%
I'll hide my legs behind the wheel.

390
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.367 line:82%
-Come here.
-Jae-seok.

391
00:20:31.266 --> 00:20:33.467 line:82%
-Come here.
-Jae-seok.

392
00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:34.700 line:82%
Jae-seok.

393
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.066 line:82%
Come here.

394
00:20:40.834 --> 00:20:41.800 line:82%
Come here, YEONJUN.

395
00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:45.300 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-Come here.

396
00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:47.300 line:82%
It's 10,000 won.

397
00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:51.867 line:82%
-Come here.
-Jae-seok, why are you so fast?

398
00:20:51.934 --> 00:20:53.867 line:82%
YEONJUN, come here. It's 10,000 won.

399
00:20:54.834 --> 00:20:56.433 line:82%
You're too fast.

400
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.567 line:82%
Let's go.

401
00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.800 line:82%
Let's run.

402
00:21:00.867 --> 00:21:02.867 line:82%
-Watch the stairs.
-No.

403
00:21:02.934 --> 00:21:04.300 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-Se-chan, the stairs.

404
00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:06.834 line:82%
I can't run because of the stairs.
Hold on.

405
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.033 line:82%
Hurry up.

406
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.633 line:82%
At this rate, I won't even get ten won.

407
00:21:14.367 --> 00:21:15.867 line:82%
-Okay.
-Stay there.

408
00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:17.800 line:82%
-I'll stay here.
-Let me go.

409
00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:20.667 line:82%
Once I earn money with this, I'll give you

410
00:21:20.734 --> 00:21:21.867 line:82%
-10,000 won.
-Give me 30,000 won.

411
00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:23.800 line:82%
-Right now?
-I'll let you go.

412
00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:25.233 line:82%
-You want 30,000 won now?
-Yes.

413
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.667 line:82%
-But…
-Then I won't chase after you again.

414
00:21:27.734 --> 00:21:29.133 line:82%
-Listen.
-It's a toll.

415
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.367 line:82%
This is worth 50,000 won.

416
00:21:30.433 --> 00:21:32.433 line:82%
If you let me go,
I'll give you 10,000 won.

417
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.066 line:82%
Come on. I can tap you and get 10,000 won.

418
00:21:35.133 --> 00:21:36.367 line:82%
-You can't catch me.
-Se-chan.

419
00:21:36.433 --> 00:21:38.133 line:82%
I did Pilates.

420
00:21:38.834 --> 00:21:42.133 line:82%
Hey, make up your mind.
If you want 10,000 won, let me go now.

421
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.600 line:82%
-Make it 20,000 won.
-Okay.

422
00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:45.266 line:82%
What? I can't make it 20,000 won.

423
00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:46.800 line:82%
Give me 20,000 won and run.

424
00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:48.433 line:82%
-Jae-seok is over there.
-Where?

425
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.500 line:82%
He went to catch YEONJUN.

426
00:21:50.567 --> 00:21:52.700 line:82%
-Exactly, JENNIE.
-You need to run away.

427
00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:56.800 line:82%
The item is worth 50,000 won.
Give me 20,000 won and go.

428
00:21:56.867 --> 00:21:59.033 line:82%
Give me 20,000 won and go.

429
00:21:59.633 --> 00:22:01.867 line:82%
I can't give you 20,000 won.
I might get caught.

430
00:22:01.934 --> 00:22:04.133 line:82%
-Hurry up.
-I'd hand over 20,000 won and run.

431
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.400 line:82%
Forget it. I'll run.

432
00:22:05.467 --> 00:22:07.133 line:82%
-I'll run.
-I'll catch you.

433
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.633 line:82%
-I'm ready.
-Okay.

434
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.400 line:82%
I'll run at full speed.

435
00:22:10.467 --> 00:22:13.600 line:82%
Then I'll catch you
before you start running.

436
00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:15.300 line:82%
Stop it.

437
00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:18.033 line:82%
Let's run.

438
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.734 line:82%
You're going that way?

439
00:22:20.834 --> 00:22:21.967 line:82%
Let's avoid JENNIE.

440
00:22:24.467 --> 00:22:26.133 line:82%
Se-chan, hold on.

441
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.266 line:82%
The mayor put a sandbag on you.

442
00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:31.133 line:82%
-What? A sandbag?
-Okay. Nice.

443
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.467 line:82%
Also, the mayor can use
one of the two policies.

444
00:22:36.533 --> 00:22:40.467 line:82%
He can put a sandbag on one trader.

445
00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:42.700 line:82%
Then it'll be harder to run.

446
00:22:42.767 --> 00:22:43.867 line:82%
The mayor has it the best.

447
00:22:43.934 --> 00:22:46.467 line:82%
Hey, I have it the best.

448
00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:50.533 line:82%
-Yang Se-chan.
-Okay.

449
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.633 line:82%
All right, YEONJUN.

450
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:53.867 line:82%
Hold on. Stay away.

451
00:22:54.567 --> 00:22:55.800 line:82%
-Come here.
-I need to put on a sandbag.

452
00:22:55.867 --> 00:22:56.967 line:82%
Go ahead and put it on.

453
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.867 line:82%
-She keeps asking…
-Jae-seok.

454
00:22:58.934 --> 00:23:00.667 line:82%
-…for bribes.
-That isn't true.

455
00:23:00.734 --> 00:23:03.000 line:82%
I tried to catch him, but he ran away.

456
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.133 line:82%
-Did you arrest him?
-No.

457
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.166 line:82%
-I arrested him.
-What's this?

458
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.500 line:82%
They were putting a sandbag on me.

459
00:23:10.567 --> 00:23:13.533 line:82%
Give me 10,000 won. Come on.

460
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.700 line:82%
Se-chan, I gave you a chance earlier.

461
00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:18.300 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-Give me 10,000 won.

462
00:23:18.834 --> 00:23:20.767 line:82%
I'll go and catch someone else.

463
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.333 line:82%
Where are the traders?

464
00:23:25.333 --> 00:23:26.734 line:82%
-Mr. Mayor.
-Yes?

465
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.400 line:82%
-I'll help you make money.
-Okay.

466
00:23:28.467 --> 00:23:30.934 line:82%
So please leave me be, okay?

467
00:23:31.767 --> 00:23:35.367 line:82%
I'll give you 20,000 won.
It's a good deal for you.

468
00:23:35.433 --> 00:23:36.834 line:82%
Did I give you 30,000 won?

469
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.967 line:82%
-It's 20,000 won.
-Yes.

470
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.667 line:82%
-I…
-Leave me be.

471
00:23:41.734 --> 00:23:44.834 line:82%
I won't put a sandbag on you.
I'll put it on YEONJUN.

472
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.600 line:82%
-Okay. Do that.
-For an additional 10,000 won.

473
00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:49.266 line:82%
-You're a thief.
-Give me more money.

474
00:23:49.333 --> 00:23:50.700 line:82%
-I'm wearing it.
-No.

475
00:23:50.767 --> 00:23:51.934 line:82%
-Listen.
-I promise you this.

476
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.600 line:82%
If I make 50,000 won with this item,

477
00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:55.433 line:82%
I'll give you your share in secret.

478
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.900 line:82%
-Is that so?
-JENNIE asked for money too.

479
00:23:57.967 --> 00:23:59.934 line:82%
Give me 20,000 won and go.

480
00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:01.834 line:82%
-Okay. Go.
-Let me make money first.

481
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.700 line:82%
-Pretend you didn't see me.
-I'll let you go.

482
00:24:09.133 --> 00:24:11.400 line:82%
-Loyalty.
-Okay.

483
00:24:11.467 --> 00:24:13.700 line:82%
-To an honest and incorruptible nation.
-Okay.

484
00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:14.800 line:82%
Hello, sir.

485
00:24:14.867 --> 00:24:17.500 line:82%
-Is that for me? Let's get started.
-Yes.

486
00:24:17.567 --> 00:24:18.567 line:82%
-Here.
-Let's see it.

487
00:24:18.633 --> 00:24:22.433 line:82%
-It's an item that can hold food.
-An item that can hold food.

488
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.100 line:82%
-Take a look.
-An item that can hold food.

489
00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:29.000 line:82%
Usually, I give it a pass
only when there's food inside.

490
00:24:29.066 --> 00:24:30.800 line:82%
That's right. Do you know what's inside?

491
00:24:30.867 --> 00:24:33.133 line:82%
My love is inside.

492
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.433 line:82%
-I need to check.
-That's right.

493
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.700 line:82%
If there's no food…

494
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:39.033 line:82%
If there's no food,
I can't give it a pass.

495
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.600 line:82%
Come on. Take a look inside.

496
00:24:41.667 --> 00:24:44.800 line:82%
-There's no food inside.
-My goodness.

497
00:24:44.867 --> 00:24:45.934 line:82%
I put something inside.

498
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.867 line:82%
Without food, how am I supposed to know
if it's a food container?

499
00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:50.700 line:82%
There it is. Take it.

500
00:24:51.433 --> 00:24:52.700 line:82%
Put it in your pocket.

501
00:24:52.767 --> 00:24:54.900 line:82%
It's clearly an item
that can hold food.

502
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.934 line:82%
There it is. Take it.
Put it in your pocket.

503
00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:02.700 line:82%
It's clearly an item
that can hold food.

504
00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:03.667 line:82%
-Okay.
-All right.

505
00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:05.934 line:82%
-All right.
-This is…

506
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.333 line:82%
This is better than food.

507
00:25:08.934 --> 00:25:10.600 line:82%
-Pass.
-To an incorruptible nation.

508
00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:11.734 line:82%
-Loyalty.
-Incorruptibility.

509
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.133 line:82%
-Pass.
-Pass.

510
00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:15.467 line:82%
What else should I bring?

511
00:25:15.533 --> 00:25:16.967 line:82%
All right.

512
00:25:17.533 --> 00:25:18.533 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Okay.

513
00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:20.600 line:82%
Take care.

514
00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:23.133 line:82%
-Did you put on the sticker by mistake?
-Yes, I did.

515
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.166 line:82%
Let's talk. What are you looking for?

516
00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:26.967 line:82%
I just want to take a stroll.

517
00:25:27.033 --> 00:25:31.133 line:82%
Wasn't there an item with a name
you needed to say correctly five times?

518
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.900 line:82%
-I believe it was worth 30,000 won.
-Oh, was there?

519
00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:35.500 line:82%
I'm not sure.

520
00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:37.600 line:82%
This is my first time. Gosh.

521
00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:40.233 line:82%
This is my first time. Gosh.

522
00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:43.467 line:82%
-Do you know what it is?
-I get it now.

523
00:25:43.533 --> 00:25:45.133 line:82%
-Do you know what it is?
-Yes, I do.

524
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.166 line:82%
-You know…
-Yes.

525
00:25:47.133 --> 00:25:49.000 line:82%
I can sell this.

526
00:25:50.633 --> 00:25:52.900 line:82%
An item with a name
you can say correctly five times.

527
00:25:52.967 --> 00:25:54.633 line:82%
Popeye, Popeye.

528
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.700 line:82%
Okay. This is good.

529
00:25:57.467 --> 00:25:58.467 line:82%
Let's see.

530
00:25:59.567 --> 00:26:01.400 line:82%
Hold on. How much is it worth?

531
00:26:01.467 --> 00:26:04.233 line:82%
-It's worth 20,000 won.
-I see.

532
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.467 line:82%
Don't you want to buy it for 10,000 won?

533
00:26:07.533 --> 00:26:09.500 line:82%
Don't you want to buy it for 10,000 won?

534
00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:10.800 line:82%
-For 10,000 won?
-Yes.

535
00:26:10.867 --> 00:26:12.567 line:82%
-It's 10,000 won.
-Oh, no.

536
00:26:12.633 --> 00:26:15.400 line:82%
-Let's split the profits too.
-The profits too?

537
00:26:15.467 --> 00:26:17.700 line:82%
Should I give you 10,000 won then?

538
00:26:17.767 --> 00:26:20.200 line:82%
-No, you should give me 30,000 won.
-30,000 won?

539
00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:22.266 line:82%
-Just now…
-No.

540
00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:23.800 line:82%
-Look. There are no people.
-Okay.

541
00:26:23.867 --> 00:26:26.700 line:82%
If you run over to customs,
you'll get 20,000 won for it.

542
00:26:29.734 --> 00:26:31.700 line:82%
Okay. I admit that 30,000 won is hefty.

543
00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:33.900 line:82%
-So it's 10,000 won.
-Yes. I'll give it to you.

544
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.233 line:82%
I'm being generous
because I'm tender-hearted.

545
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300 line:82%
All right.

546
00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:42.066 line:82%
-Did you put on the sticker?
-What?

547
00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:44.533 line:82%
Hold on.

548
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.467 line:82%
-Are you serious?
-You must put it on.

549
00:26:46.533 --> 00:26:48.433 line:82%
Should I go after putting it on?

550
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.066 line:82%
-Okay.
-Put it on.

551
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.767 line:82%
Put it on.

552
00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.500 line:82%
Yes.

553
00:27:00.266 --> 00:27:01.567 line:82%
Yes.

554
00:27:01.633 --> 00:27:03.367 line:82%
You need to pay a fine of 10,000 won.

555
00:27:04.467 --> 00:27:06.233 line:82%
It has to be done.

556
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.934 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-I'm sorry. I feel bad.

557
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.300 line:82%
I tasted the bitterness of life.

558
00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:11.467 line:82%
It's 10,000 won.

559
00:27:12.834 --> 00:27:14.266 line:82%
JENNIE, seriously.

560
00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:15.600 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-JENNIE.

561
00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:19.133 line:82%
This is my fourth week on the show,
so I've changed.

562
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.367 line:82%
So this is how it's done.

563
00:27:20.433 --> 00:27:22.100 line:82%
Yes. This makes my heart ache too.

564
00:27:22.166 --> 00:27:24.000 line:82%
-Understood.
-Okay.

565
00:27:24.066 --> 00:27:27.200 line:82%
I'm sorry. I must take this as well.
Gosh, I feel so bad.

566
00:27:27.266 --> 00:27:29.667 line:82%
I have something to do over there.

567
00:27:29.734 --> 00:27:30.900 line:82%
Take care.

568
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.333 line:82%
See you later.

569
00:27:36.967 --> 00:27:40.000 line:82%
-There's money all over the place.
-It's all over the place.

570
00:27:40.066 --> 00:27:42.333 line:82%
It's so easy to earn money.

571
00:27:42.934 --> 00:27:44.800 line:82%
-What a place.
-Seriously.

572
00:27:44.867 --> 00:27:48.467 line:82%
-There's money all over the place.
-It's all over the place.

573
00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:51.500 line:82%
You earned a lot of money.

574
00:27:52.867 --> 00:27:54.467 line:82%
Hey, you earned a lot of money.

575
00:27:57.033 --> 00:27:58.433 line:82%
-What?
-What's this sound?

576
00:27:59.767 --> 00:28:00.867 line:82%
What's this?

577
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.066 line:82%
-What's this?
-Will ghosts come out?

578
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.734 line:82%
What's this?

579
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.500 line:82%
-What?
-Maybe the typhoon is a clue.

580
00:28:16.467 --> 00:28:17.800 line:82%
Is that the sound of wind?

581
00:28:17.867 --> 00:28:20.967 line:82%
Is there something
behind the current mission?

582
00:28:22.433 --> 00:28:25.066 line:82%
…who smuggle goods for personal gain.

583
00:28:25.133 --> 00:28:27.734 line:82%
Such social evils will have no place
in people's lives.

584
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.367 line:82%
Is there a secret?

585
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.700 line:82%
With one hand?

586
00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:44.166 line:82%
All right. There'll be an inspection.

587
00:28:44.233 --> 00:28:46.633 line:82%
These money-grubbers are driving me crazy.

588
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.667 line:82%
Let me make money.

589
00:28:48.734 --> 00:28:49.567 line:82%
How much is it worth?

590
00:28:49.633 --> 00:28:51.367 line:82%
It's worth 30,000 won.
I'll pay 10,000 won.

591
00:28:51.433 --> 00:28:55.433 line:82%
Jae-seok, JENNIE will definitely run
toward me, so please stop her.

592
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.934 line:82%
-Okay.
-I'll pay you later.

593
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.100 line:82%
-Here's 10,000 won.
-Okay.

594
00:28:59.166 --> 00:29:00.166 line:82%
That's mine.

595
00:29:00.233 --> 00:29:03.066 line:82%
-Give me that too.
-Then I won't have anything left.

596
00:29:03.133 --> 00:29:04.433 line:82%
-Please stop JENNIE.
-Okay.

597
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.333 line:82%
Please stop her.

598
00:29:09.033 --> 00:29:10.967 line:82%
Then I won't have anything left.

599
00:29:11.033 --> 00:29:13.300 line:82%
-Please stop JENNIE.
-Okay.

600
00:29:15.767 --> 00:29:17.600 line:82%
-In any case…
-Jae-seok.

601
00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:19.166 line:82%
-In any case, we help…
-Jae-seok.

602
00:29:19.233 --> 00:29:20.767 line:82%
-…each other.
-What's in your bag?

603
00:29:20.834 --> 00:29:23.166 line:82%
-JENNIE. You're--
-Mr. Mayor.

604
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.233 line:82%
Hold on to her.

605
00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:32.667 line:82%
Okay.

606
00:29:33.767 --> 00:29:35.233 line:82%
All right.

607
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.900 line:82%
In any case, we have to help each other.

608
00:29:38.967 --> 00:29:40.300 line:82%
-Mr. Mayor.
-Listen.

609
00:29:40.367 --> 00:29:42.066 line:82%
-You disappoint me.
-JENNIE.

610
00:29:42.133 --> 00:29:43.533 line:82%
I expected better when I voted for you.

611
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.367 line:82%
We help each other.

612
00:29:45.433 --> 00:29:47.834 line:82%
-And this is the '70s.
-Okay.

613
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.567 line:82%
-You didn't become mayor via an election.
-Really?

614
00:29:50.633 --> 00:29:54.133 line:82%
Mayors were appointed by the government.

615
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.767 line:82%
This was before the local governments.

616
00:29:56.834 --> 00:29:58.734 line:82%
You need to know
the historical background.

617
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.233 line:82%
So I wasn't elected by the people.

618
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.633 line:82%
I see. I understand.

619
00:30:04.633 --> 00:30:06.700 line:82%
To an honest and incorruptible nation.

620
00:30:06.767 --> 00:30:08.000 line:82%
Incorruptibility.

621
00:30:09.233 --> 00:30:10.633 line:82%
-Hello.
-Okay.

622
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.734 line:82%
Mr. Customs Official.

623
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.100 line:82%
Sticking money there
isn't very incorruptible.

624
00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:16.700 line:82%
This isn't money. It's decoration.

625
00:30:16.767 --> 00:30:18.500 line:82%
You don't need to see anything else.

626
00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:21.333 line:82%
Just look at the green bill.

627
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.300 line:82%
It's an item I can hold with one hand.

628
00:30:23.367 --> 00:30:27.000 line:82%
-What? An item you can hold with one hand?
-I can do it for ten seconds.

629
00:30:27.066 --> 00:30:27.900 line:82%
Let's see it.

630
00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:33.000 line:82%
It's a piece of cake.
I can do it for a minute.

631
00:30:33.066 --> 00:30:34.533 line:82%
Mr. Customs Official.

632
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.266 line:82%
The bill is too heavy.
You should remove it.

633
00:30:38.333 --> 00:30:40.166 line:82%
I'm not sure if it's enough.

634
00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:44.033 line:82%
-It's light.
-It's too light.

635
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.767 line:82%
Is that so?

636
00:30:45.834 --> 00:30:50.300 line:82%
Mr. Customs Official,
you're out of control.

637
00:30:50.934 --> 00:30:54.333 line:82%
Hold on. Who's there?
I think someone came.

638
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.967 line:82%
Who came? Who is it?

639
00:30:56.033 --> 00:30:59.166 line:82%
My goodness, must you ask?
It's another 10,000-won bill.

640
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:01.233 line:82%
Hold it for ten seconds.

641
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.934 line:82%
All right.

642
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.800 line:82%
-Pass.
-Pass.

643
00:31:07.867 --> 00:31:09.100 line:82%
Incorruptibility.

644
00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:11.100 line:82%
Taste it.

645
00:31:11.166 --> 00:31:13.200 line:82%
You're good, Se-chan.

646
00:31:13.266 --> 00:31:14.700 line:82%
It's nothing.

647
00:31:16.133 --> 00:31:18.300 line:82%
Here's 30,000 won.

648
00:31:18.367 --> 00:31:20.333 line:82%
-Please fill it.
-It's 30,000 won.

649
00:31:23.066 --> 00:31:25.300 line:82%
You need to play it.

650
00:31:25.367 --> 00:31:28.066 line:82%
-Even if you include a bribe…
-I'll show you. Hold on.

651
00:31:30.367 --> 00:31:32.133 line:82%
-Time is ticking.
-Okay.

652
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.367 line:82%
-Mr. Customs Official, I'll play it.
-You need to play it.

653
00:31:34.433 --> 00:31:36.767 line:82%
-An item that can be played.
-I'll play it.

654
00:31:36.834 --> 00:31:39.633 line:82%
-Let's see if you can play it.
-Please watch.

655
00:31:43.233 --> 00:31:44.600 line:82%
I can hear it.

656
00:31:45.233 --> 00:31:46.266 line:82%
I can hear it.

657
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.900 line:82%
How strange. I see that it can be played.

658
00:31:51.467 --> 00:31:54.266 line:82%
I didn't know that it was
a musical instrument.

659
00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:57.333 line:82%
I see that it can be played.

660
00:32:01.834 --> 00:32:03.567 line:82%
-You're good.
-I see that it works.

661
00:32:03.633 --> 00:32:04.834 line:82%
-Is it a pass?
-Pass.

662
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.600 line:82%
Pass! Thank you.

663
00:32:06.667 --> 00:32:08.533 line:82%
It can be played.

664
00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:12.467 line:82%
I didn't know such a thing existed.

665
00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:15.000 line:82%
I'll be back. Good luck.

666
00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:16.300 line:82%
Good luck.

667
00:32:19.433 --> 00:32:21.433 line:82%
What's up with that?

668
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.567 line:82%
-What's that?
-It's strange, right?

669
00:32:23.633 --> 00:32:25.500 line:82%
-Is the LED screen broken?
-It's strange.

670
00:32:25.567 --> 00:32:27.433 line:82%
-It's broken.
-It is?

671
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.633 line:82%
-But it shows clouds.
-Right?

672
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.533 line:82%
It disappeared.

673
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.367 line:82%
-I completed that space earlier.
-What?

674
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.066 line:82%
What?

675
00:32:37.133 --> 00:32:38.700 line:82%
-Is it an actual dog?
-No.

676
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.467 line:82%
What's up with the crow sounds?

677
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.100 line:82%
-We keep hearing noises.
-I heard the wind.

678
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.667 line:82%
This time, it's the sound
of a dog barking.

679
00:32:55.233 --> 00:32:56.667 line:82%
Wind and barking sounds.

680
00:32:58.233 --> 00:33:00.367 line:82%
-Is there a secret?
-I don't know.

681
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.900 line:82%
I…

682
00:33:05.967 --> 00:33:06.800 line:82%
What's that?

683
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.100 line:82%
I still have 100,000 won.

684
00:33:10.166 --> 00:33:12.100 line:82%
YEONJUN, why do you have 100,000 won?

685
00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:14.066 line:82%
-Tae-hyun is no joke.
-I lost a lot of money.

686
00:33:14.133 --> 00:33:16.100 line:82%
Tae-hyun has 100,000 won.

687
00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:18.734 line:82%
How did that happen?

688
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.700 line:82%
-YEONJUN, you did well.
-Seriously.

689
00:33:23.767 --> 00:33:25.066 line:82%
I thought I was doing the worst.

690
00:33:25.633 --> 00:33:27.333 line:82%
-What did I do?
-I ran diligently.

691
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.433 line:82%
Only two.

692
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.834 line:82%
How much was it worth?

693
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.567 line:82%
-I'm at the bottom.
-I need to be more strict.

694
00:33:33.233 --> 00:33:36.734 line:82%
-It's time for lunch.
-Okay.

695
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.567 line:82%
Let's first play the Bucket Game
for a hint.

696
00:33:39.633 --> 00:33:40.467 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

697
00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:57.000 line:82%
All right. The Bucket Game.

698
00:33:58.066 --> 00:34:02.467 line:82%
The game involves moving ingredients
from the second floor to the first floor.

699
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.133 line:82%
From there to here?

700
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.033 line:82%
The member on the first floor
will describe the needed ingredients.

701
00:34:09.633 --> 00:34:12.133 line:82%
The member on the second floor
will find the ingredients

702
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.333 line:82%
that match the description.

703
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.834 line:82%
Then the ingredients will be put
into a bucket and sent to the first floor.

704
00:34:18.667 --> 00:34:20.200 line:82%
-Okay.
-It's cute.

705
00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:23.767 line:82%
Here's what you will do
with the ingredients.

706
00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:26.567 line:82%
You'll make a dish.

707
00:34:27.367 --> 00:34:30.734 line:82%
So you shouldn't let the other team send
the right ingredients.

708
00:34:31.367 --> 00:34:33.467 line:82%
The defense will be on both floors

709
00:34:34.033 --> 00:34:36.633 line:82%
where they will use various tools
to keep the opposing team

710
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.266 line:82%
from communicating
the ingredients clearly.

711
00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:40.633 line:82%
It'll bring good cheer.

712
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.400 line:82%
The results will be determined
by the quality of the dish.

713
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.633 line:82%
The offense should send
the correct ingredients,

714
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.333 line:82%
and the defense should make them send
the wrong ingredients.

715
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.600 line:82%
Here it comes.

716
00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:04.033 line:82%
-Let's make gimbap. Gimbap sounds good.
-Yes.

717
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.033 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

718
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.300 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

719
00:35:11.367 --> 00:35:12.200 line:82%
Let's begin.

720
00:35:12.266 --> 00:35:14.066 line:82%
I'm the one who's cooking.

721
00:35:14.567 --> 00:35:17.100 line:82%
-Tae-hyun, can you hear me?
-Yes.

722
00:35:17.166 --> 00:35:18.834 line:82%
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

723
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.633 line:82%
Although you can hear her now…

724
00:35:23.433 --> 00:35:25.367 line:82%
As if it's your last

725
00:35:25.934 --> 00:35:28.667 line:82%
You can't stand so close to me.

726
00:35:28.734 --> 00:35:30.200 line:82%
I'll push you away.

727
00:35:30.266 --> 00:35:34.000 line:82%
As if it's your last

728
00:35:35.667 --> 00:35:37.133 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

729
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.533 line:82%
He's a singer and I'm a musical actor.

730
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.967 line:82%
Ready, set--

731
00:35:42.033 --> 00:35:44.633 line:82%
Se-chan, play the music!

732
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.066 line:82%
Play the music.

733
00:35:48.533 --> 00:35:50.033 line:82%
Yes!

734
00:35:59.867 --> 00:36:02.300 line:82%
It lives in the sea.

735
00:36:02.367 --> 00:36:04.767 line:82%
It lives in the sea.

736
00:36:05.567 --> 00:36:06.734 line:82%
Hey.

737
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.266 line:82%
It lives in the sea.

738
00:36:16.667 --> 00:36:21.967 line:82%
It isn't a fish.

739
00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:25.934 line:82%
It lives in the sea.

740
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.567 line:82%
It isn't a fish.

741
00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:35.934 line:82%
Time's up. Stop.

742
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.867 line:82%
-Okay.
-Time's up.

743
00:36:37.934 --> 00:36:40.033 line:82%
Mister, please stop now.

744
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600 line:82%
She got it.

745
00:36:45.133 --> 00:36:46.433 line:82%
I know what it is.

746
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.300 line:82%
I have a hunch.

747
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.200 line:82%
-Here it comes.
-Okay.

748
00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.667 line:82%
-Here it comes.
-Here it comes.

749
00:36:59.266 --> 00:37:00.333 line:82%
What?

750
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.066 line:82%
We got seaweed.

751
00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:05.600 line:82%
-Seaweed?
-Seaweed.

752
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.500 line:82%
Why did you give us seaweed?

753
00:37:08.567 --> 00:37:11.400 line:82%
Something that lives in the sea
and isn't a fish.

754
00:37:12.233 --> 00:37:14.100 line:82%
Why did she give us seaweed?

755
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.834 line:82%
Did she get it wrong?

756
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.600 line:82%
Why did you take this role
if you couldn't shout?

757
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.900 line:82%
Jae-seok, she can't hear me
because of them.

758
00:37:28.967 --> 00:37:30.633 line:82%
I'll do it this time.

759
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.667 line:82%
What's next? We need ham.

760
00:37:35.734 --> 00:37:36.934 line:82%
How do I describe it?

761
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.834 line:82%
-Tuna?
-Let's begin.

762
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.600 line:82%
Ready, go.

763
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.967 line:82%
The sea.

764
00:37:44.467 --> 00:37:45.300 line:82%
The emperor of the sea.

765
00:37:46.266 --> 00:37:47.467 line:82%
What?

766
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.867 line:82%
The emperor of the sea.

767
00:37:54.934 --> 00:37:57.533 line:82%
-The emperor of the sea.
-The fruit of the sea.

768
00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.433 line:82%
A fish.

769
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.900 line:82%
The emperor of the sea.

770
00:38:01.467 --> 00:38:03.233 line:82%
-The emperor.
-The fruit of the sea.

771
00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:05.700 line:82%
The fruit of the sea.

772
00:38:06.266 --> 00:38:07.367 line:82%
The fruit of the sea?

773
00:38:07.934 --> 00:38:09.033 line:82%
It can't be dried pollack.

774
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.900 line:82%
Anchovies?

775
00:38:10.967 --> 00:38:12.667 line:82%
The fruit of the sea.

776
00:38:13.567 --> 00:38:17.100 line:82%
Five, four, three…

777
00:38:17.166 --> 00:38:20.967 line:82%
-Five, four, three…
-The emperor of the sea?

Hold on. Is there more?

783
00:38:34.066 --> 00:38:35.800 line:82%
-That's it.
-I think it's anchovies.

784
00:38:35.867 --> 00:38:38.066 line:82%
-Anchovies?
-Not this one. Yes.

785
00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:43.800 line:82%

793
00:38:58.834 --> 00:38:59.767 line:82%
What is it?

794
00:38:59.834 --> 00:39:02.467 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-The emperor of the sea.

795
00:39:02.533 --> 00:39:04.433 line:82%
How is anchovy the emperor of the sea?

797
00:39:07.433 --> 00:39:09.667 line:82%

798
00:39:09.734 --> 00:39:11.734 line:82%
-I'm so annoyed.
-Unbelievable.

799
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.934 line:82%
-It's too late.
-Correct.

800
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.900 line:82%
Se-chan, that punk.

801
00:39:17.133 --> 00:39:18.633 line:82%
What are we going to do?

802
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.533 line:82%
We'll need to use the anchovies.

803
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.300 line:82%
I'll get the eggs.

804
00:39:22.934 --> 00:39:24.433 line:82%
What should I do?

805
00:39:25.734 --> 00:39:27.633 line:82%
I started cooking the seaweed in water.

806
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.967 line:82%
Well done.

807
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:32.166 line:82%
Ready, set, go.

808
00:39:33.834 --> 00:39:37.533 line:82%
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

809
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.166 line:82%
Egg. Cock-a-doodle-doo.

810
00:39:41.233 --> 00:39:42.633 line:82%
-Squid egg?
-Egg.

811

812
00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:46.500 line:82%
-Cock-a-doodle-doo.
-Squid egg.

813
00:39:46.567 --> 00:39:48.800 line:82%
Your voice is gone. Move out of the way.

814
00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:51.200 line:82%
Not ketchup.

815
00:39:52.567 --> 00:39:55.600 line:82%
Ketchup. Not ketchup.

816
00:39:56.166 --> 00:39:59.133 line:82%
Ketchup. Not ketchup.

817
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.266 line:82%
Not ketchup.

818
00:40:13.333 --> 00:40:15.367 line:82%
Stop.

819
00:40:15.433 --> 00:40:16.767 line:82%
You couldn't hear it, right?

820
00:40:16.834 --> 00:40:19.767 line:82%
-Se-chan, seriously.
-Go, JENNIE.

821
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:22.333 line:82%
I couldn't hear anything.
But it was pretty long.

822
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.166 line:82%
"Naninanya." It was something like that.

823
00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.800 line:82%
"Ahneunyanya." It had four syllables.

824
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.066 line:82%
Did he say, "Red cabbage"?

825
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.100 line:82%
One, two-- Hurry up and send it down.

826
00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:38.333 line:82%
-I don't know.
-Hold on.

827
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.000 line:82%
Is it coming down? What is it?

828
00:40:40.066 --> 00:40:41.000 line:82%
It's hooked.

829
00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:42.967 line:82%
He started counting, so I got whatever.

830
00:40:43.033 --> 00:40:44.567 line:82%
Let's go.

831
00:40:44.633 --> 00:40:46.367 line:82%
-What is it?
-What?

832
00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:50.233 line:82%
Blueberries?

833
00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:52.900 line:82%
Blueberries.

834
00:40:52.967 --> 00:40:54.600 line:82%
-We have to use it.
-It's a delicacy.

835
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.066 line:82%
What are we making?

836
00:40:57.934 --> 00:41:01.667 line:82%
-We have to do it.
-We have to use the ingredients.

837
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.633 line:82%
-Let's switch places.
-Switch places?

838
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.900 line:82%
-I can't listen to
kkwaenggwari
anymore.
-Go over there.

839
00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:11.000 line:82%
It was a
kkwaenggwari
hell.

840
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.033 line:82%
Why does it keep changing?

841
00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:22.100 line:82%
I don't miss anything.

842
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:23.900 line:82%
What? What's that?

843
00:41:25.133 --> 00:41:27.033 line:82%
The screen changed again.

844
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.767 line:82%
There's something about it, Jae-seok.

845
00:41:30.834 --> 00:41:32.967 line:82%
-A picture is coming along.
-I think so.

846
00:41:33.033 --> 00:41:34.467 line:82%
A picture is coming along.

847
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.400 line:82%
-What's this?
-Is there a secret?

848
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.867 line:82%
There must be a twist.

849
00:41:48.467 --> 00:41:50.834 line:82%
-YEONJUN and Se-chan.
-Yes.

850
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.400 line:82%
-Speak clearly with your mouth wide open.
-Okay.

851
00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:56.100 line:82%
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can.

852
00:41:56.166 --> 00:41:57.433 line:82%
All right.

853
00:42:00.967 --> 00:42:02.333 line:82%
It's so loud.

854
00:42:04.367 --> 00:42:05.934 line:82%
Tae-hyun, do you want to play it?

855
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.300 line:82%
Western breakfast?

856
00:42:14.367 --> 00:42:15.700 line:82%
Shall I ask for milk?

857
00:42:15.767 --> 00:42:17.800 line:82%
-Let's begin.

Hold on. I can't hear you.

863
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.233 line:82%
-Rice wine?
-Moo.

864
00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.300 line:82%

00:42:38.367 --> 00:42:39.367 line:82%
Dairy cow.

866
00:42:42.133 --> 00:42:43.633 line:82%
-Mouse.
-No gestures.

867
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.667 line:82%

Ten…

874
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.867 line:82%
It was like an exorcism.

875

-All right.
-We were like…

876
00:43:09.233 --> 00:43:11.934 line:82%

-It's correct.
-Na-ra's hearing is bad.

904
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.133 line:82%
How are we supposed to eat this?

905
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.700 line:82%
Shall we ask for lettuce next?

906
00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:35.200 line:82%
It's easy.

907
00:44:35.266 --> 00:44:37.166 line:82%

YEONJUN, it looks like you're very angry.

They're too loud.

921

00:45:25.967 --> 00:45:27.200 line:82%

They're too loud.

924
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.600 line:82%
JENNIE, you're having so much fun.

925
00:45:34.333 --> 00:45:36.533 line:82%
You should try busking on the street.

926
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.433 line:82%
-It suits you.
-I found a talent.

Red.

947
00:46:27.767 --> 00:46:31.300 line:82%
Foreigners eat it instead of rice.

948
00:46:31.367 --> 00:46:33.867 line:82%
Instead of rice.

949
00:46:33.934 --> 00:46:35.200 line:82%

Why?

959
00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:04.800 line:82%
We added cheese-filled crackers
to our sandwich.

960
00:47:04.867 --> 00:47:06.900 line:82%
-Pineapple.
-Blueberries don't suit gimbap.

961
00:47:06.967 --> 00:47:10.233 line:82%

-Let's watch it.
-Let's watch it.

966
00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:28.000 line:82%
Is it working?

967
00:47:32.367 --> 00:47:34.500 line:82%
In Korea, the economy will grow

968
00:47:34.567 --> 00:47:36.166 line:82%
and construction projects will come along.

969

972
00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:46.066 line:82%
I go there often.

973
00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:49.266 line:82%
-It was built in 1968.
-Really?

974
00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.266 line:82%
-It was built in 1968.
-Really?

975

That's right. Samil Overpass.
It has been demolished.

The groundbreaking ceremony
for Namsan's second tunnel

977

at the National Cultural Center.

978
00:47:59.767 --> 00:48:04.700 line:82%

without any breaks.

980
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.300 line:82%
Our economy will grow more rapidly.

981
00:48:11.867 --> 00:48:15.433 line:82%

What?

984
00:48:20.533 --> 00:48:21.800 line:82%
That's it?

985
00:48:21.867 --> 00:48:23.233 line:82%
Is that a hint?

986
00:48:24.433 --> 00:48:27.934 line:82%
From the late '60s to the early '70s,

987
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.300 line:82%
as the video showed…

988
00:48:29.367 --> 00:48:31.700 line:82%

I have no idea what this video means.

991
00:48:35.734 --> 00:48:37.567 line:82%
What were those sounds we heard?

-That's right.

993

994
00:48:45.033 --> 00:48:47.033 line:82%
-What?
-What's this sound?

995
00:48:49.233 --> 00:48:51.300 line:82%

996
00:48:52.467 --> 00:48:55.066 line:82%
-What's up with the crow sounds?
-What?

997
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.867 line:82%
…is being constructed continuously
without any breaks.

998
00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.533 line:82%
Perhaps it was
a corrupt construction project.

999
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.600 line:82%
What's this?

1000
00:49:07.667 --> 00:49:08.867 line:82%
tvN?

1001
00:49:08.934 --> 00:49:10.333 line:82%
-tvN?
-It's not tvN?

1002
00:49:12.233 --> 00:49:13.834 line:82%
No, it isn't. It's YNT.

1003
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.734 line:82%
-There's something here.
-You're right.

1004
00:49:20.133 --> 00:49:21.800 line:82%
What's YNT?

1005
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.700 line:82%
-TNY?
-YTN?

1006
00:49:24.767 --> 00:49:27.200 line:82%

00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:34.533 line:82%
-In any case, we're in the '70s.
-Yes, the '70s.

1008
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.700 line:82%
We need to focus on that.

1009
00:49:35.767 --> 00:49:38.767 line:82%
-Construction.
-"Good materials, cozy site."

1010
00:49:38.834 --> 00:49:41.333 line:82%

-It's related to construction.
-Yes.

1013
00:49:45.233 --> 00:49:49.266 line:82%
And wasn't Woo-il a manager
from a construction company?

1014
00:49:49.333 --> 00:49:51.367 line:82%
-It's related to construction.
-Definitely.

1015

That's right.

1017

I cooked ramyeon with barley tea.

1045
00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:36.200 line:82%
No wonder the color is dark.

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.066 line:82%
-Not the moon, but…
-The sun.

1247
00:59:56.133 --> 00:59:58.000 line:82%
-There you go.
-Sun.
Ssi.

1248
00:59:58.066 --> 01:00:00.967 line:82%
-There you go.
-Sun.

1249

My goodness.
Ga, na, da, ra, ma…

1254
01:00:07.934 --> 01:00:08.934 line:82%
-Ba.
-Sa.

1255
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.033 line:82%
No.
Ma.

1256
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.033 line:82%
Ga, na, da, ra.

1257
01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.233 line:82%
-Ma.
-Ma, ba.

1258
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.266 line:82%
-An animal with a long neck.
-Giraffe.

1259
01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:17.433 line:82%
-Okay.
-Almost done.

1260
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:18.333 line:82%
Giraffe.

1261
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.367 line:82%
-Okay.
-Almost done.

1262
01:00:19.433 --> 01:00:22.300 line:82%
-Gi.
-What's the answer?

1263
01:00:22.367 --> 01:00:24.633 line:82%
-Give her time.
-Give me a bit of time.

1264
01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.633 line:82%
-Sun.

01:00:29.567 --> 01:00:31.000 line:82%
Myeon.

1268
01:00:31.066 --> 01:00:33.233 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Ga, na, da, ra, ma.

1269
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.333 line:82%

01:00:50.133 --> 01:00:52.033 line:82%
My goodness.

1276
01:00:53.033 --> 01:00:57.734 line:82%
-What about
bassi?
It means nothing.
-Ra.

1277
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.033 line:82%
Ra.
A sunflower seed.

1278
01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.834 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1279
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.300 line:82%

-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1281
01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.767 line:82%
Gosh.

1282
01:01:07.433 --> 01:01:08.533 line:82%
Impressive.

1283
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.967 line:82%
-It's about memory.
-Next team.

1284
01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:11.633 line:82%
-It's about memory.
-Memory.

1285
01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:12.934 line:82%
Let's go.

1286
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.967 line:82%
-We did well.
-We really did well.

1287
01:01:15.033 --> 01:01:17.000 line:82%
-YEONJUN, let's go.
-Let's go.

1288
01:01:17.066 --> 01:01:18.834 line:82%
Open your mouth wide.

1289
01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.200 line:82%
-What?
-What's going on?

1290
01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:26.867 line:82%
-What?
-What?

1291
01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:28.934 line:82%
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1292
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.166 line:82%
-Who splashed water?
-What?

1293
01:01:31.233 --> 01:01:32.900 line:82%
Why are you doing this?

1294
01:01:36.834 --> 01:01:38.734 line:82%
In Korea, the economy will grow

1295
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.867 line:82%
and construction projects will come along.

1296
01:01:50.734 --> 01:01:52.066 line:82%
-What?
-Was it rain?

1297
01:01:52.133 --> 01:01:55.300 line:82%
I thought someone was splashing water
at us for being loud.

1298
01:01:55.367 --> 01:01:57.500 line:82%
I thought someone was peeing.

1299
01:01:57.567 --> 01:01:59.100 line:82%
I was so startled.

1300
01:01:59.166 --> 01:02:02.133 line:82%
What was that? Was it spit?

1301
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.667 line:82%
-You can see more parts of the picture.
-What?

1302
01:02:04.734 --> 01:02:05.633 line:82%
What?

1303
01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:09.400 line:82%
It's a school. Maybe not.
Is it an apartment?

1304
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.066 line:82%
I became absorbed in the sounds
without even realizing it.

1305
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.200 line:82%
What's the secret of this apartment?

1306
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.934 line:82%
Were the sections revealed
in the order of the bingo spaces?

1307
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.900 line:82%
-The bingo spaces we filled?
-Yes.

1308
01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:44.367 line:82%
-What's this?
-You need a hint to get to the secret.

1309
01:02:44.433 --> 01:02:46.300 line:82%
Do you always keep the members
in the dark?

1310
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.033 line:82%
What's this? So it isn't a mistake.
There's a picture.

1311
01:02:51.433 --> 01:02:53.767 line:82%
-Let's check out the hint.
-By ourselves?

1312
01:02:53.834 --> 01:02:55.367 line:82%
Let's go. Na-ra, come here.

1313
01:02:55.433 --> 01:02:56.567 line:82%
Let's go.

1314
01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:58.367 line:82%
What's this?

1315
01:02:58.433 --> 01:02:59.433 line:82%
It was here before.

1316
01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.133 line:82%
-I bet there's a meaning.
-Seriously. What could it be?

1317
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.400 line:82%
-What's this?
-Y, N, T.

1318
01:03:03.467 --> 01:03:05.266 line:82%
-This one.
-YNT.

1319
01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:08.667 line:82%
X, Z, L, Y, N, T.

1320
01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:19.400 line:82%
-I don't even know what I'm looking for.
-Seriously.

1321
01:03:19.467 --> 01:03:20.467 line:82%
Let's watch it.

1322
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.066 line:82%
…that caused a stir in society…

1323
01:03:30.934 --> 01:03:33.266 line:82%
…were arrested and brought to justice.

1324
01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:34.400 line:82%
UNLICENSED

1325
01:03:35.467 --> 01:03:37.266 line:82%
-"Unlicensed"?
-"Unlicensed."

1326
01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:40.266 line:82%
At the court-martial that took place
in Gyeonggi Province,

1327
01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:42.400 line:82%
those who insulted the youths' spirits…

1328
01:03:42.467 --> 01:03:44.233 line:82%
To set an example,

1329
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.800 line:82%
they received prison sentences
of three months to a year.

1330
01:03:52.433 --> 01:03:55.667 line:82%
Twenty-one people were arrested.

1331
01:03:55.734 --> 01:03:57.834 line:82%
On November 20th…

1332
01:03:59.533 --> 01:04:01.800 line:82%
…were imprisoned for the violation of…

1333
01:04:01.867 --> 01:04:05.200 line:82%
The police continue to investigate
the related personnel.

1334
01:04:06.066 --> 01:04:09.867 line:82%
The Central Intelligence Agency
is investigating their additional crimes.

1335
01:04:09.934 --> 01:04:12.734 line:82%
THE FIRST CAUSE,
UNLICENSED TRADERS

1336
01:04:13.367 --> 01:04:15.734 line:82%
-Who were these people?
-What?

1337
01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.700 line:82%
Is this a hint?

1338
01:04:16.767 --> 01:04:18.233 line:82%
Who were these people?

1339
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.934 line:82%
-Is this a hint?
-It has to be a hint.

1340
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.867 line:82%
Who were these people?

1341
01:04:22.934 --> 01:04:25.700 line:82%
-They weren't thugs, right?
-They weren't thugs.

1342
01:04:25.767 --> 01:04:27.767 line:82%
-What?
-I think this is something big.

1343
01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:29.233 line:82%
X-Y-T.

1344
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.400 line:82%
Is this a hint? I still have no idea.

1345
01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:33.767 line:82%
-Seriously.
-I still don't have a clue.

1346
01:04:33.834 --> 01:04:36.200 line:82%
I don't think they were politicians.

1347
01:04:36.266 --> 01:04:37.633 line:82%
I have no clue.

1348
01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.734 line:82%
What's this?

1349
01:04:40.066 --> 01:04:43.333 line:82%
-It's impossible to figure out the hint.
-I have no idea.

1350
01:04:48.033 --> 01:04:52.033 line:82%
We'll now begin the final round.

1351
01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.533 line:82%
-Good. You know…
-Okay.

1352
01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.266 line:82%
-…I think both sides should be flexible.
-Understood.

1353
01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:59.166 line:82%
-YEONJUN, be flexible.
-Okay.

1354
01:04:59.233 --> 01:05:00.734 line:82%
You're the most rigid.

1355
01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:07.033 line:82%
…you'll have six hours
until the end of construction.

1356
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.567 line:82%
If all 25 spaces get filled,

1357
01:05:09.633 --> 01:05:11.166 line:82%
Team Traders will win.

1358
01:05:13.834 --> 01:05:16.767 line:82%
If Team Traders gets stopped

1359
01:05:16.834 --> 01:05:18.800 line:82%
and fails to fill all 25 spaces in time,

1360
01:05:18.867 --> 01:05:21.266 line:82%
Team Public Officials will win.

1361
01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:25.734 line:82%
Among the members of the losing team,

1362
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.333 line:82%
the one who collected the most money

1363
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.400 line:82%
will receive it in cash.

1364
01:05:35.066 --> 01:05:37.767 line:82%
Traders, go to your positions.

1365
01:05:40.467 --> 01:05:42.166 line:82%
I haven't the slightest idea.

1366
01:05:42.233 --> 01:05:45.467 line:82%
The hint was so difficult.
I don't have a clue.

1367
01:05:46.066 --> 01:05:48.033 line:82%
-Who were those people?
-Beats me.

1368
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.567 line:82%
I lived through the era,
but I don't remember.

1369
01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:54.400 line:82%
-At first, I thought they were thugs.
-Okay.

1370
01:05:54.467 --> 01:05:57.667 line:82%
-Maybe they were in construction.
-I don't have a clue.

1371
01:05:57.734 --> 01:06:00.166 line:82%
-In any case, good luck.
-See you soon.

1372
01:06:01.533 --> 01:06:04.967 line:82%
I'll remember that this is
an individual match.

1373
01:06:05.533 --> 01:06:07.567 line:82%
I'll aim to fill a line
on the bingo board.

1374
01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:11.233 line:82%
I need to make a line,
but all the spaces are full.

1375
01:06:12.467 --> 01:06:16.166 line:82%
If a trader completes a line,

1376
01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:19.567 line:82%
he or she will receive
100,000 won in addition.

1377
01:06:21.934 --> 01:06:24.333 line:82%
-It's an individual game.
-Yes.

1378
01:06:30.133 --> 01:06:32.734 line:82%
Mr. Customs Official.

1379
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.700 line:82%
-I'd like to talk to you.
-Okay.

1380
01:06:34.767 --> 01:06:38.700 line:82%
I'll give you a lot of money,

1381
01:06:38.767 --> 01:06:41.367 line:82%
-so please be lenient with my items.
-Okay.

1382
01:06:41.433 --> 01:06:44.500 line:82%
Even if I bring two or three items,
please overlook them.

1383
01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:47.633 line:82%
I'll be lenient in the beginning.

1384
01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.734 line:82%
All right. This is the final round.

1385
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.133 line:82%
Ready, go.

1386
01:06:55.166 --> 01:06:57.767 line:82%
Let's scout the area.

1387
01:06:59.567 --> 01:07:01.367 line:82%
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

1388
01:07:01.433 --> 01:07:03.066 line:82%
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

1389
01:07:03.133 --> 01:07:05.100 line:82%
-He's carrying some items.
-Se-chan.

1390
01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:08.300 line:82%
-His hands are full.
-He's bringing some items.

1391
01:07:08.367 --> 01:07:10.834 line:82%
Please let me go. Please turn a blind eye.

1392
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.367 line:82%
We might be able to turn a blind eye

1393
01:07:13.433 --> 01:07:15.533 line:82%
if you help us out.

1394
01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.567 line:82%
-You'll get a lot of money for these.
-I know.

1395
01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:20.900 line:82%
All of these items are
only worth 50,000 won.

1396
01:07:20.967 --> 01:07:22.700 line:82%
-He'll get 80,000 won.
-It's 20,000 and 10,000 won.

1397
01:07:22.767 --> 01:07:23.667 line:82%
He'll get more.

1398
01:07:23.734 --> 01:07:26.967 line:82%
-Give us 20,000 won each.
-Did you say 20,000 won each?

1399
01:07:27.033 --> 01:07:30.333 line:82%
Didn't you talk about being flexible?
You're so rigid.

1400
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.300 line:82%
Three items will get you more money.

1401
01:07:32.367 --> 01:07:35.567 line:82%
-We weren't so strict with you.
-Seriously.

1402
01:07:35.633 --> 01:07:37.567 line:82%
-You've earned a lot of money.
-I know.

1403
01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:39.133 line:82%
Here's 10,000 won.

1404
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.000 line:82%
-You're rich.
-No, I'm not.

1405
01:07:41.066 --> 01:07:43.266 line:82%
-Give us 30,000 won each.
-No.

1406
01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:45.200 line:82%
-Give us 30,000 won each.
-Be flexible.

1407
01:07:45.266 --> 01:07:48.166 line:82%
-We can't let you go then.
-We can't let you go then.

1408
01:07:48.734 --> 01:07:50.033 line:82%
Give us 30,000 won each.

1409
01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.567 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Please go now.

1410
01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:54.800 line:82%
-Let's go.
-You can pass.

1411
01:07:55.667 --> 01:07:58.767 line:82%
I'm sorry, but you guys are like
thugs in the alley.

1412
01:07:58.834 --> 01:07:59.934 line:82%
You robbed me in the alley.

1413
01:08:00.066 --> 01:08:02.266 line:82%
-We build relationships through gifts.
-Yes.

1414
01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:05.066 line:82%
-Take care.
-For goodness' sake.

1415
01:08:05.133 --> 01:08:07.467 line:82%
By the way, you're a police officer, but…

1416
01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:11.300 line:82%
You're like a thug.

1417
01:08:11.867 --> 01:08:13.300 line:82%
See you later, Mr. Mayor.

1418
01:08:13.367 --> 01:08:15.000 line:82%
Where is YEONJUN?

1419
01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.500 line:82%
You know…

1420
01:08:26.433 --> 01:08:28.066 line:82%
Why is there a video player here?

1421
01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.700 line:82%
Is it for us to use?

1422
01:08:34.433 --> 01:08:36.367 line:82%
What's going on today?

1423
01:08:37.834 --> 01:08:39.333 line:82%
YEONJUN.

1424
01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.633 line:82%
Okay. Well done.

1425
01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.834 line:82%
-That one too.
-Here you are.

1426
01:08:45.567 --> 01:08:47.900 line:82%
-That one too.
-Here you are.

1427
01:08:48.633 --> 01:08:49.900 line:82%
I looked for you everywhere.

1428
01:08:49.967 --> 01:08:51.767 line:82%
-This is…
-My goodness.

1429
01:08:53.133 --> 01:08:55.200 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.

1430
01:08:55.266 --> 01:08:57.100 line:82%
-I'll help.
-I'm studying.

1431
01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:58.367 line:82%
-To get into university.
-Let's see.

1432
01:08:58.433 --> 01:09:00.667 line:82%
I have to get into university.

1433
01:09:00.734 --> 01:09:02.066 line:82%
Good luck.

1434
01:09:02.133 --> 01:09:05.367 line:82%
Hold on, where are you going?

1435
01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.166 line:82%
-How did you get paid so much?
-No.

1436
01:09:07.233 --> 01:09:09.233 line:82%
-This is a lot.
-I just received it.

1437
01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.600 line:82%
-What?
-Just now.

1438
01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:12.600 line:82%
-Is that so? You made a lot of money.
-Yes.

1439
01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:14.400 line:82%
-Give me 20,000 won.
-What?

1440
01:09:14.467 --> 01:09:15.333 line:82%
Give me 20,000 won.

1441
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.400 line:82%
Isn't this too much?

1442
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.867 line:82%
This is just robbery.

1443
01:09:19.934 --> 01:09:21.166 line:82%
Don't you have an item?

1444
01:09:21.233 --> 01:09:23.867 line:82%
-You can go then. Don't you have an item?
-No, I don't.

1445
01:09:23.934 --> 01:09:27.100 line:82%
You'd better not get caught by me.

1446
01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.934 line:82%
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why am I so scared?

1447
01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:31.433 line:82%
What is it?

1448
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.333 line:82%
An item with a person's face.

1449
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.066 line:82%
-An item with a person's face.
-Yes.

1450
01:09:36.133 --> 01:09:37.133 line:82%
Ta-da.

1451
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200 line:82%
BOY SCOUTS

1452
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.400 line:82%
-An item with a person's face.
-You're right. It's spot on.

1453
01:09:50.467 --> 01:09:51.700 line:82%
It's spot on, right?

1454
01:09:51.767 --> 01:09:53.800 line:82%
I also have an item with a person's face.

1455
01:09:54.367 --> 01:09:56.467 line:82%
-Let's make a deal.
-What's this?

1456
01:09:56.533 --> 01:09:57.700 line:82%
An item with a person's face.

1457
01:09:58.367 --> 01:10:00.400 line:82%
-Take a look.
-Please.

1458
01:10:00.467 --> 01:10:03.467 line:82%
-I see.
-A person's face.

1459
01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.567 line:82%
If you open the book,
you'll see a person's face. Open it.

1460
01:10:06.633 --> 01:10:07.934 line:82%
There's a person, right?

1461
01:10:08.433 --> 01:10:10.767 line:82%
-There is, right?
-Gosh.

1462
01:10:10.834 --> 01:10:13.834 line:82%
-There is. I see a good person.
-Yes.

1463
01:10:14.433 --> 01:10:16.367 line:82%
-Don't be like that.
-A person's face.

1464
01:10:16.433 --> 01:10:18.066 line:82%
Stop it. We're on the same team.

1465
01:10:18.133 --> 01:10:19.700 line:82%
-Seriously.
-I need that space.

1466
01:10:19.767 --> 01:10:22.834 line:82%
I do too. This is the only way
I can complete a line.

1467
01:10:26.533 --> 01:10:29.166 line:82%
It'll be meaningless to take it.
You won't get to complete it.

1468
01:10:29.233 --> 01:10:30.567 line:82%
I'll take care of it.

1469
01:10:30.633 --> 01:10:32.633 line:82%
Are you both going for a bingo?

1470
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:35.367 line:82%
-Gosh, a bingo.
-This hurts my pride.

1471
01:10:35.433 --> 01:10:36.967 line:82%
Gosh, this is bad.

1472
01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:39.166 line:82%
I don't know if I can allow it.

1473
01:10:39.233 --> 01:10:41.200 line:82%
-Help me.
-What should I do?

1474
01:10:41.266 --> 01:10:42.967 line:82%
If you bribe me like this,

1475
01:10:43.033 --> 01:10:44.734 line:82%
you'll lose everything at customs.

1476
01:10:45.333 --> 01:10:47.033 line:82%
-If you look over here--
-Hold on.

1477
01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.900 line:82%
-This is--
-Hold on.

1478
01:10:48.967 --> 01:10:50.500 line:82%
Come on, Tae-hyun.

1479
01:10:51.734 --> 01:10:53.934 line:82%
You put me in a tight spot.

1480
01:10:55.133 --> 01:10:57.734 line:82%
-I'm giving you three.
-Three?

1481
01:11:01.166 --> 01:11:02.500 line:82%
I'm giving you three.

1482
01:11:02.567 --> 01:11:03.633 line:82%
Let's go.

1483
01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.633 line:82%
Remember the 20,000 won
I gave you earlier?

1484
01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.533 line:82%
-I've decided.
-You've decided.

1485
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.900 line:82%
You've decided.

1486
01:11:09.467 --> 01:11:12.000 line:82%
I'll give it to Na-ra.

1487
01:11:12.066 --> 01:11:14.367 line:82%
Thank you.

1488
01:11:14.433 --> 01:11:16.967 line:82%
-All right.
-Thank you.

1489
01:11:17.033 --> 01:11:19.900 line:82%
-Hey, you're rolling in dough.
-Okay.

1490
01:11:19.967 --> 01:11:22.600 line:82%
-You'll buy an apartment at this rate.
-No.

1491
01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:24.900 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1492
01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.400 line:82%
ITEM WITH A PERSON'S FACE

1493
01:11:33.633 --> 01:11:36.667 line:82%
There's a playground.
Is there something I can sell?

1494
01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:41.300 line:82%
What's this? Why is there a rice cooker?

1495
01:11:42.033 --> 01:11:46.066 line:82%
It'll be a good idea
to take the rice cooker and sell it.

1496
01:11:47.066 --> 01:11:50.934 line:82%
Students passing by will think
that I'm strange.

1497
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.333 line:82%
Is this okay?

1498
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.500 line:82%
My goodness.

1499
01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:56.200 line:82%
I'm a bit embarrassed.

1500
01:11:59.233 --> 01:12:00.934 line:82%
Hello.

1501
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.367 line:82%
Hello.

1502
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.734 line:82%
Hello.

1503
01:12:06.133 --> 01:12:07.500 line:82%
Hello.

1504
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.166 line:82%
Hello.

1505
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.300 line:82%
Hello.

1506
01:12:12.367 --> 01:12:14.734 line:82%
I'm embarrassed.

1507
01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.633 line:82%
I need to get out of here.

1508
01:12:20.266 --> 01:12:21.934 line:82%
There's a guitar too.

1509
01:12:23.934 --> 01:12:25.533 line:82%
I have a favor to ask.

1510
01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.066 line:82%
Please pick up this guitar.

1511
01:12:27.633 --> 01:12:30.266 line:82%
I'll take all the items and sell them.

1512
01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:35.900 line:82%
I don't know what's going on,
so I'll focus on making money.

1513
01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.934 line:82%
If my team loses,

1514
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.166 line:82%
I'll need to have something for myself.

1515
01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.934 line:82%
So let's do this.

1516
01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:53.734 line:82%
Hey, what are you doing?

1517
01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:54.934 line:82%
-Are you a customer?
-Yes.

1518
01:12:57.633 --> 01:12:59.066 line:82%
Come on.

1519
01:13:00.867 --> 01:13:02.834 line:82%
Take your pick.

1520
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.900 line:82%
Are there any customers?

1521
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.066 line:82%
-A business?
-It's a flea market.

1522
01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:11.834 line:82%
-A flea market?
-That's right. This is a good item.

1523
01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.400 line:82%
-It's nice.
-It's heavy.

1524
01:13:13.467 --> 01:13:15.266 line:82%
-How much is it?
-Let's see.

1525
01:13:16.233 --> 01:13:19.467 line:82%
In my opinion, this item can be sold
for 40,000 won.

1526
01:13:19.533 --> 01:13:22.533 line:82%
-Did you say 40,000 won?
-It's 15 kg to 20 kg.

1527
01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.600 line:82%
-Did you try lifting it up?
-Yes, I did.

1528
01:13:25.433 --> 01:13:27.700 line:82%
I'll let you have it for 20,000 won.

1529
01:13:27.767 --> 01:13:29.800 line:82%
What if I buy these two items?

1530
01:13:29.867 --> 01:13:30.867 line:82%
-This one too?
-Yes.

1531
01:13:31.967 --> 01:13:33.967 line:82%
This item was hard to find.

1532
01:13:34.767 --> 01:13:38.000 line:82%
You know, I could've gone
and collected the items myself.

1533
01:13:38.066 --> 01:13:40.166 line:82%
Then I would've caught you and asked

1534
01:13:40.233 --> 01:13:41.934 line:82%
-for 10,000 won.
-Right. Understood.

1535
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.934 line:82%
I'll give you these items for 50,000 won.

1536
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000 line:82%
I only have 30,000 won.

1537
01:13:47.066 --> 01:13:49.433 line:82%
-Did you say 30,000 won?
-I'm poor. I lost it all.

1538
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.734 line:82%
-Don't lie.
-I'm serious.

1539
01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.633 line:82%
If you only have 30,000 won,
take this one.

1540
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:55.033 line:82%
It was 20,000 won.

1541
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.400 line:82%
-The price has risen since then.
-You're a swindler!

1542
01:13:57.467 --> 01:14:00.934 line:82%
Aren't you a cop?
Listen, you said it was 20,000 won.

1543
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.834 line:82%
I don't remember.

1544
01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.734 line:82%
I'm determined to earn money diligently
and get out of last place.

1545
01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.433 line:82%
It's bound to weigh 13 kg.

1546
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:10.734 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1547
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.133 line:82%
It weighs around 5 kg.

1548
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.500 line:82%
It doesn't weigh around 5 kg.

1549
01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.033 line:82%
All right. You can take it for 30,000 won.

1550
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.433 line:82%
My goodness.

1551
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.900 line:82%
Must you go that far?

1552
01:14:19.467 --> 01:14:21.367 line:82%
I can't figure out the hint,

1553
01:14:21.433 --> 01:14:23.133 line:82%
-so I'll just run a business here.
-Okay.

1554
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.133 line:82%
-I'll give you 30,000 won.
-Take the item.

1555
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.633 line:82%
-I'll take the item.
-Okay.

1556
01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:31.066 line:82%
Should I go and find more items?

1557
01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.633 line:82%
I think this is lucrative.

1558
01:14:35.467 --> 01:14:39.233 line:82%
What's the secret of this apartment?

1559
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.734 line:82%
I think this pattern holds a clue.
What could it be?

1560
01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.166 line:82%
What could it be? Z, X…

1561
01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:49.433 line:82%
I think they're connected.

1562
01:14:53.133 --> 01:14:55.734 line:82%
All right. JENNIE.

1563
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.567 line:82%
JENNIE.

1564
01:15:02.734 --> 01:15:05.700 line:82%
X. Who could be X among us?

1565
01:15:07.266 --> 01:15:09.200 line:82%
Is the culprit among us?

1566
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.467 line:82%
What could it be?

1567
01:15:13.033 --> 01:15:15.133 line:82%
I can't figure it out.

1568
01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.166 line:82%
-Mr. Customs Official, I'm here.
-Which item did you bring?

1569
01:15:20.233 --> 01:15:21.900 line:82%
-An item that brings laughter.
-Okay.

1570
01:15:24.567 --> 01:15:26.700 line:82%
-I don't laugh easily.
-Okay.

1571
01:15:26.767 --> 01:15:28.467 line:82%
One, two, three.

1572
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.066 line:82%
You're taking so many bribes.

1573
01:15:40.133 --> 01:15:42.700 line:82%
-Oh Na-ra, pass.
-Pass.

1574
01:15:42.767 --> 01:15:44.934 line:82%
-It made me laugh.
-An item that brings laughter.

1575
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.700 line:82%
-Pass.
-Pass.

1576
01:15:47.767 --> 01:15:48.900 line:82%
My goodness.

1577
01:15:50.066 --> 01:15:51.967 line:82%
-My goodness.
-Here's 20,000 won.

1578
01:15:52.033 --> 01:15:55.200 line:82%
Why is my sticker
on a space I didn't fill out?

1579
01:15:55.266 --> 01:15:56.400 line:82%
Was it moved?

1580
01:15:57.467 --> 01:16:00.066 line:82%
Why is my sticker
on a space I didn't fill out?

1581
01:16:00.133 --> 01:16:01.133 line:82%
Was it moved?

1582
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.433 line:82%
-It was changed.
-You should've been more careful.

1583
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:06.567 line:82%
-I'll give it to Na-ra.
-Thank you.

1584
01:16:06.633 --> 01:16:08.400 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1585
01:16:08.467 --> 01:16:10.500 line:82%
-Sir.
-Yes?

1586
01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:11.967 line:82%
He's the mayor.

1587
01:16:12.033 --> 01:16:15.100 line:82%
You're the mayor. I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.

1588
01:16:15.166 --> 01:16:18.100 line:82%
You can switch spaces, right?
Please do that for me. I'll pay you.

1589
01:16:18.667 --> 01:16:21.133 line:82%
The mayor can switch spaces

1590
01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.433 line:82%
and keep a trader from completing a bingo.

1591
01:16:27.867 --> 01:16:29.500 line:82%
I don't have more. This is it.

1592
01:16:29.567 --> 01:16:31.100 line:82%
Give me 70,000 won.

1593
01:16:31.166 --> 01:16:33.367 line:82%
-I'll give you 50,000 won.
-It's worth a lot.

1594
01:16:33.433 --> 01:16:36.633 line:82%
Listen, you. I mean, listen, Mr. Mayor.

1595
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.433 line:82%
Let's say I give you 70,000 won.

1596
01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.467 line:82%
If you switch spaces for other traders,

1597
01:16:41.533 --> 01:16:43.033 line:82%
my fist won't stay still.

1598
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:47.233 line:82%
I'm serious. I won't care
if you're a mayor or a public official.

1599
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.834 line:82%
Hold on. I'll make a change.

1600
01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.433 line:82%
Was it changed? Was such a thing possible?

1601
01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.066 line:82%
I guess he bribed the mayor.

1602
01:16:57.133 --> 01:16:59.066 line:82%
For goodness' sake. Okay.

1603
01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.500 line:82%
Jae-seok. Mr. Mayor.

1604
01:17:02.567 --> 01:17:05.367 line:82%
-Wait, the mayor will make a lot of money.
-Mr. Mayor.

1605
01:17:05.433 --> 01:17:06.934 line:82%
If I empty my pockets…

1606
01:17:07.967 --> 01:17:09.633 line:82%
I'll tell you this.

1607
01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.500 line:82%
I've given you 70,000 won earlier.

1608
01:17:12.567 --> 01:17:13.600 line:82%
Mr. Mayor.

1609
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.533 line:82%
Hello, Mr. Mayor. I told you earlier

1610
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.233 line:82%
-that I might have something you need.
-I'm with a complainant,

1611
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.500 line:82%
so please come back later.

1612
01:17:21.567 --> 01:17:24.500 line:82%
-You don't have money.
-I don't. This is all I have.

1613
01:17:24.567 --> 01:17:26.867 line:82%
-This is my last resort.
-Who will you push away?

1614
01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.834 line:82%
-What?
-Who will you push away?

1615
01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:31.767 line:82%
Come to the mayor's office one at a time.

1616
01:17:31.834 --> 01:17:33.400 line:82%
Hold on.

1617
01:17:35.033 --> 01:17:36.834 line:82%
-Hold on.
-Let's have a talk.

1618
01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.066 line:82%
Where is my money?

1619
01:17:38.133 --> 01:17:39.934 line:82%
Complainants keep following me.

1620
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.967 line:82%
You opened a counseling office.

1621
01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:44.734 line:82%
-Enter one at a time.
-Please wait here.

1622
01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:46.467 line:82%
Mr. Mayor.

1623
01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:50.900 line:82%
Mr. Mayor, I'll cut to the chase.

1624
01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:54.133 line:82%
I have 40,000 won right now.

1625
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.767 line:82%
Didn't you have more?

1626
01:17:56.834 --> 01:18:00.767 line:82%
I had 110,000 won,
but I gave you 70,000 won.

1627
01:18:00.834 --> 01:18:02.200 line:82%
I'm out of money. I'm serious.

1628
01:18:02.834 --> 01:18:04.967 line:82%
I'm out of money.

1629
01:18:05.533 --> 01:18:07.166 line:82%
I need 10,000 won at the very least.

1630
01:18:07.233 --> 01:18:08.333 line:82%
Take 30,000 won.

1631
01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:11.367 line:82%
I just need to go there and yell, "Bingo."

1632
01:18:11.934 --> 01:18:13.400 line:82%
Then I'll be done.

1633
01:18:14.567 --> 01:18:16.867 line:82%
Okay, I'll think about it.

1634
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.467 line:82%
Wait. You'll think about it?

1635
01:18:19.533 --> 01:18:21.467 line:82%
Will you take the money
and forget about me?

1636
01:18:21.533 --> 01:18:24.400 line:82%
If you make a deal with someone else--
Hold on.

1637
01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:26.467 line:82%
-I could use my fist.
-Look.

1638
01:18:26.533 --> 01:18:28.200 line:82%
-This is the mayor's office.
-I'm sorry.

1639
01:18:28.266 --> 01:18:30.367 line:82%
This is where I work for the government.

1640
01:18:30.433 --> 01:18:31.767 line:82%
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1641
01:18:31.834 --> 01:18:34.233 line:82%
Please keep your promise.

1642
01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.700 line:82%
It's simple. You just need to go down
and make a small change.

1643
01:18:37.767 --> 01:18:39.133 line:82%
All right.

1644
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.166 line:82%
Okay.

1645
01:18:40.233 --> 01:18:44.300 line:82%
By the way, if anything happens later
it has nothing to do with me.

1646
01:18:44.367 --> 01:18:45.633 line:82%
Of course.

1647
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.633 line:82%
I'll keep my mouth shut. I met no one.

1648
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.133 line:82%
All right. You can go now.

1649
01:18:50.233 --> 01:18:53.233 line:82%
Do you have about one million won?
You have so much money.

1650
01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:55.166 line:82%
-What are you saying?
-Mr. Mayor.

1651
01:18:55.233 --> 01:18:57.300 line:82%
It's nothing. Besides, it's…

1652
01:18:57.367 --> 01:18:59.100 line:82%
-Is it for state affairs?
-Yes.

1653
01:18:59.166 --> 01:19:00.433 line:82%
Okay. Please sort things out.

1654
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.667 line:82%
-Okay, understood.
-I have 10,000 won now.

1655
01:19:03.266 --> 01:19:05.600 line:82%
I'm dirt poor now.

1656
01:19:05.667 --> 01:19:07.066 line:82%
Mr. Mayor.

1657
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.667 line:82%
-Come on in.
-Okay.

1658
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.066 line:82%
The column I can complete for a bingo

1659
01:19:15.133 --> 01:19:20.066 line:82%
has Se-chan and YEONJUN's stickers.

1660
01:19:20.133 --> 01:19:22.000 line:82%
If you could please remove them.

1661
01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:25.800 line:82%
As you may know,

1662
01:19:25.867 --> 01:19:27.333 line:82%
being a public official…

1663
01:19:29.467 --> 01:19:33.934 line:82%
I've become quite wary
of affecting people's relationships--

1664
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.133 line:82%
Gosh, it's hot.

1665
01:19:39.934 --> 01:19:41.834 line:82%
-How much do you have there?
-My goodness.

1666
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.867 line:82%
The total amount of money I have

1667
01:19:44.433 --> 01:19:46.233 line:82%
is 60,000 won.

1668
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.667 line:82%
I'll give you half of it.

1669
01:19:48.734 --> 01:19:50.467 line:82%
-Half.
-Yes. Half.

1670
01:19:50.533 --> 01:19:53.100 line:82%
-In that case, let's do this.
-What?

1671
01:19:53.166 --> 01:19:54.767 line:82%
Just use that money for yourself.

1672
01:19:58.633 --> 01:20:03.400 line:82%
Na-ra, throughout my long career
as a public official,

1673
01:20:03.467 --> 01:20:06.133 line:82%
I've accepted bribes.

1674
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.567 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay?

1675
01:20:08.633 --> 01:20:10.500 line:82%
To be honest, I've accepted them.

1676
01:20:10.567 --> 01:20:12.433 line:82%
It's half of my entire fortune.

1677
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:15.033 line:82%
Someone gave me everything
except for 10,000 won.

1678
01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.700 line:82%
-I'm dirt poor now.
-For goodness' sake.

1679
01:20:16.767 --> 01:20:19.467 line:82%
Unbelievable. You want everything.

1680
01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:23.233 line:82%
-I'm being honest since we're close.
-At that rate, you'll become bald.

1681
01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.033 line:82%
-Let's make a deal some other time.
-Forget it.

1682
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.333 line:82%
-Some other time.
-Okay.

1683
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.734 line:82%
Some other time.

1684
01:20:30.233 --> 01:20:31.266 line:82%
Unbelievable.

1685
01:20:31.333 --> 01:20:33.934 line:82%
How much did Se-chan give him?

1686
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.166 line:82%
I need to find a spicy item.

1687
01:20:36.233 --> 01:20:37.633 line:82%
Where was the spicy ramyeon?

1688
01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.500 line:82%
What?

1689
01:20:43.166 --> 01:20:44.333 line:82%
I think it's gotten bigger.

1690
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:48.000 line:82%
What's this? Y, N, T, L, X, Z.

1691
01:20:49.033 --> 01:20:51.166 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1692
01:20:51.233 --> 01:20:52.800 line:82%
I don't understand the meaning.

1693
01:21:00.567 --> 01:21:01.567 line:82%
What?

1694
01:21:05.633 --> 01:21:06.633 line:82%
What?

1695
01:21:07.467 --> 01:21:09.867 line:82%
What's this videotape? What's this?

1696
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.500 line:82%
Why is there a video player here?

1697
01:21:18.033 --> 01:21:19.600 line:82%
What's going on today?

1698
01:21:21.166 --> 01:21:23.066 line:82%
Hold on. I'll watch it over there.

1699
01:21:39.033 --> 01:21:40.166 line:82%
Yes.

public officials' corruption"?

1702
01:21:53.166 --> 01:21:55.567 line:82%
EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGE

1703
01:21:55.633 --> 01:21:59.133 line:82%
Prime Minister Jeong investigated
corruption among public officials

1704
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.333 line:82%
and promised to take on the new missions

1705
01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.433 line:82%
of protecting the honest public officials

1706
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.367 line:82%
and creating a system
of inspection requests.

1707
01:22:06.433 --> 01:22:08.166 line:82%
10 TONS OF GOODS EMBEZZLED

1708
01:22:08.934 --> 01:22:11.600 line:82%
Embezzled during transportation?

1709
01:22:15.633 --> 01:22:17.633 line:82%
What's that TV?

1710
01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:19.867 line:82%
There's a videotape inside.

1711
01:22:21.667 --> 01:22:23.300 line:82%
"Public officials' corruption."

1712
01:22:24.166 --> 01:22:25.333 line:82%
Money.

1713
01:22:27.367 --> 01:22:30.533 line:82%
What I did today was misconduct.

1714
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.867 line:82%
Then the hint video I watched was about

1715
01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:36.300 line:82%
busting the public officials' corruption.

1716
01:22:36.367 --> 01:22:38.967 line:82%
Was I committing that crime?

1717
01:22:39.033 --> 01:22:41.133 line:82%
Maybe I'll get arrested.

1718
01:22:46.433 --> 01:22:47.800 line:82%
This is a story about us.

1719
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.033 line:82%
This is a story about us.

1720
01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.700 line:82%
So something got embezzled

1721
01:22:56.767 --> 01:22:58.500 line:82%
while being transported.

1722
01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.834 line:82%
What on earth

1723
01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:05.567 line:82%
is the meaning behind
the sound of the wind, the dog barking,

1724
01:23:05.633 --> 01:23:07.700 line:82%
and the splash of water?

1725
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.600 line:82%
How are they connected?

1726
01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.700 line:82%
Gosh, it's so hard.

1727
01:23:15.767 --> 01:23:17.834 line:82%
Apartment404
is so hard.

1728
01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.233 line:82%
-All right.
-Take it.

1729
01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.066 line:82%
Gosh, someone might see.

1730
01:23:26.133 --> 01:23:28.433 line:82%
It's an item that's over 40 years old.

1731
01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.233 line:82%
An item that's over 40 years old
and an item that's over a meter long.

1732
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.033 line:82%
Okay. Here it is.

1733
01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:35.266 line:82%
I'll give it some wings.

1734
01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:37.066 line:82%
The shoe shines now.

1735
01:23:37.133 --> 01:23:40.500 line:82%
Then I'll do a cool turn.

1736
01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:41.600 line:82%
Okay.

1737
01:23:41.667 --> 01:23:44.633 line:82%
I put something inside.

1738
01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.533 line:82%
-My goodness.
-Isn't it nice?

1739
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.433 line:82%
Okay.

1740
01:23:48.834 --> 01:23:51.166 line:82%
-It's 40,000 won.
-Thank you.

1741
01:24:04.633 --> 01:24:06.100 line:82%
Hello.

1742
01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:08.200 line:82%
I brought a spicy item.

1743
01:24:08.266 --> 01:24:10.367 line:82%
A spicy item?

1744
01:24:10.433 --> 01:24:12.233 line:82%
If you haven't brought food,

1745
01:24:13.233 --> 01:24:14.600 line:82%
I'll need to see it.

1746
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.233 line:82%
Spicy, right?

1747
01:24:24.867 --> 01:24:26.734 line:82%
-She hit him so hard.
-No way.

1748
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.934 line:82%
She hit him so hard.

1749
01:24:29.367 --> 01:24:30.567 line:82%
Spicy, right?

1750
01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:35.266 line:82%
-Are you okay?
-No way.

1751
01:24:35.333 --> 01:24:37.133 line:82%
-You hit him so hard.
-It's spicy.

1752
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.533 line:82%
-I heard a cracking sound.
-I heard it.

1753
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.767 line:82%
How spicy.

1754
01:24:41.467 --> 01:24:43.033 line:82%
You hurt my pride.

1755
01:24:43.967 --> 01:24:45.767 line:82%
Was it spicy or not?

1756
01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:49.266 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

1757
01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:50.467 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

1758
01:24:50.533 --> 01:24:51.800 line:82%
Here's 50,000 won.

1759
01:24:51.867 --> 01:24:52.934 line:82%
-Thank you.
-I went easy on you

1760
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.433 line:82%
-since you've paid me well. Okay.
-Thanks.

1761
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.567 line:82%
SPICY ITEM

1762
01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.633 line:82%
Mr. Mayor.

1763
01:25:01.133 --> 01:25:03.300 line:82%
-I need a word with you.
-Okay.

1764
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.200 line:82%
Change the spaces for me.

1765
01:25:06.266 --> 01:25:08.900 line:82%
The round will end soon,
so change the spaces for me.

1766
01:25:08.967 --> 01:25:09.967 line:82%
You know…

1767
01:25:10.033 --> 01:25:11.133 line:82%
Yes?

1768
01:25:13.934 --> 01:25:15.533 line:82%
This is a story about us.

1769
01:25:17.433 --> 01:25:18.734 line:82%
You know…

1770
01:25:20.567 --> 01:25:21.567 line:82%
What is it?

1771
01:25:22.734 --> 01:25:23.967 line:82%
What is it?

1772
01:25:24.734 --> 01:25:26.166 line:82%
Everything will come to an end.

1773
01:25:26.233 --> 01:25:28.433 line:82%
If I help him get a bingo, it'll end.

1774
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.467 line:82%
Making a bingo is an individual match.

1775
01:25:30.533 --> 01:25:32.400 line:82%
It only benefits him, not us.

1776
01:25:32.467 --> 01:25:35.967 line:82%
-It's an individual match.
-Why would you help him make it?

1777
01:25:36.033 --> 01:25:38.133 line:82%
I see that I shouldn't help him make it.

1778
01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:40.400 line:82%
Mr. Mayor.

1779
01:25:40.467 --> 01:25:42.867 line:82%
-He said I shouldn't do it.
-Mr. Mayor.

1780
01:25:43.433 --> 01:25:45.867 line:82%
Then give me back my 100,000 won.

1781
01:25:45.934 --> 01:25:49.000 line:82%
You almost lost everything.
What are you doing?

1782
01:25:49.066 --> 01:25:51.400 line:82%
-He paid 100,000 won?
-The 30,000 from earlier.

1783
01:25:53.033 --> 01:25:54.467 line:82%
How about the 70,000 won?

1784
01:25:54.533 --> 01:25:57.166 line:82%
I can't give that back.
I changed the spaces once.

1785
01:25:57.233 --> 01:25:59.734 line:82%
-I changed the spaces once.
-Unbelievable.

1786
01:26:00.367 --> 01:26:01.834 line:82%
-Guys.
-I've never seen

1787
01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.367 line:82%
such a delinquent mayor.

1788
01:26:04.433 --> 01:26:05.967 line:82%
Mister, listen.

1789
01:26:06.033 --> 01:26:07.734 line:82%
Why don't you want to do it?

1790
01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.700 line:82%
-I can't do it. I watched a video.
-Okay.

1791
01:26:10.767 --> 01:26:12.333 line:82%
Everyone got arrested in it.

1792
01:26:13.567 --> 01:26:16.100 line:82%
Corrupt public officials got arrested.

1793
01:26:17.266 --> 01:26:18.600 line:82%
So take it.

1794
01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:20.100 line:82%
-Give me an additional 20,000 won.
-What?

1795
01:26:20.166 --> 01:26:22.166 line:82%
And stay abroad for a while.

1796
01:26:25.367 --> 01:26:28.667 line:82%
You gave us the most money.

1797
01:26:28.734 --> 01:26:30.834 line:82%
If I open my mouth,
all of you will go down.

1798
01:26:33.033 --> 01:26:33.867 line:82%
Hey.

1799
01:26:34.567 --> 01:26:36.834 line:82%
I have a bad feeling about this.

1800
01:26:38.166 --> 01:26:39.166 line:82%
Later on…

1801
01:26:40.467 --> 01:26:43.100 line:82%
-We…
-We might suffer the consequences

1802
01:26:43.166 --> 01:26:44.734 line:82%
of taking bribes at the end.

1803
01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.166 line:82%
I know. I'm worried
that I'll go to prison.

1804
01:26:48.233 --> 01:26:49.433 line:82%
Seriously.

1805
01:26:50.734 --> 01:26:52.133 line:82%
We took bribes.

1806
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.567 line:82%
-As public officials, we took bribes.
-That's right.

1807
01:26:55.633 --> 01:26:58.066 line:82%
Was it an event
that took place in the '70s?

1808
01:26:58.133 --> 01:27:01.367 line:82%
Twenty-one people were arrested.

1809
01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:06.300 line:82%
That must be the case.

1810
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.200 line:82%
-We…
-"That must be the case."

1811
01:27:10.266 --> 01:27:12.867 line:82%
We figured out the secret.

1812
01:27:13.433 --> 01:27:16.333 line:82%
After watching that video,

1813
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.834 line:82%
I actually feel very anxious.

1814
01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.800 line:82%
-What's going on?
-Perhaps it's a ploy to make us anxious.

1815
01:27:21.867 --> 01:27:24.367 line:82%
-I don't know.
-Money.

1816
01:27:24.433 --> 01:27:26.700 line:82%
You took so many bribes.

1817
01:27:26.767 --> 01:27:28.200 line:82%
Seriously.

1818
01:27:28.266 --> 01:27:31.600 line:82%
I'll stay in prison for at least 30 years.

1819
01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:33.967 line:82%
-Seriously, Jae-seok.
-It won't end with ten years.

1820
01:27:34.033 --> 01:27:36.266 line:82%
Even if the setting is the '70s,

1821
01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:38.433 line:82%
I'll stay in prison for decades.

1822
01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.600 line:82%
Ji-ho will visit you.

1823
01:27:46.934 --> 01:27:48.533 line:82%
-What?
-What? Hold on.

1824
01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.767 line:82%
-What?
-What? Hold on.

1825
01:27:50.934 --> 01:27:52.000 line:82%
What? Hold on.

1826
01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:53.900 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-What?

1827
01:27:53.967 --> 01:27:57.333 line:82%
-What's going on? Hold on.
-What's this?

1828
01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.333 line:82%
-Hold on.
-What?

1829
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.400 line:82%
-Hold on.
-What?

1830
01:28:04.433 --> 01:28:06.066 line:82%
Is it a fire?

1831
01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:11.033 line:82%
-No way.
-For a while…

1832
01:28:16.266 --> 01:28:17.700 line:82%
Is it a fire?

1833
01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.500 line:82%
What's this?

1834
01:28:22.133 --> 01:28:23.934 line:82%
It must be a sign.

1835
01:28:24.867 --> 01:28:26.133 line:82%
That's what it feels like.

1836
01:28:30.367 --> 01:28:31.633 line:82%
What should I do?

1837
01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:33.700 line:82%
What should I do with all this money?

1838
01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.033 line:82%
I have something to do over there.

1839
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.934 line:82%
I'm determined to earn money diligently
and get out of last place.

1840
01:28:45.066 --> 01:28:46.867 line:82%
What should I do with all this money?

1841
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.900 line:82%
I was crazy about money.

1842
01:28:54.934 --> 01:28:56.967 line:82%
-I'll think of it as pocket money.
-Okay.

1843
01:28:57.033 --> 01:28:58.233 line:82%
Okay.

1844
01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.133 line:82%
-Give us 30,000 won each.
-No.

1845
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.200 line:82%
What's this?

1846
01:29:07.533 --> 01:29:08.734 line:82%
This comb--

1847
01:29:09.867 --> 01:29:11.133 line:82%
This comb--

1848
01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.533 line:82%
They're so obsessed with the bingo
that they don't care about the smoke.

1849
01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.467 line:82%
-I can't believe them.
-Don't they see the smoke?

1850
01:29:17.533 --> 01:29:19.934 line:82%
Money has blinded them.

1851
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.033 line:82%
The apartment is burning.

1852
01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:24.166 line:82%
Listen.

1853
01:29:24.233 --> 01:29:27.333 line:82%
There's smoke coming out,
but you're still trying to get a bingo.

1854
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.867 line:82%
All right. We saw it.

1855
01:29:30.934 --> 01:29:32.300 line:82%
-Did you see it?
-Yes, he did.

1856
01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.367 line:82%
I saw it.

1857
01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:36.233 line:82%
-Mr. Mayor.
-Yes?

1858
01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.467 line:82%
-I need to talk to you for a second.
-Why?

1859
01:29:38.533 --> 01:29:41.300 line:82%
-Please do me one last favor.
-What is it?

1860
01:29:41.367 --> 01:29:44.333 line:82%
One bingo space will get
an orange sticker.

1861
01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.800 line:82%
Please make it go away.

1862
01:29:46.734 --> 01:29:49.967 line:82%
-Mr. Mayor, this is my entire fortune.
-What is it?

1863
01:29:50.033 --> 01:29:52.967 line:82%
This is my entire fortune.

1864
01:29:53.033 --> 01:29:54.500 line:82%
-The bingo?
-Yes.

1865
01:29:54.567 --> 01:29:56.567 line:82%
-Please let me get a bingo.
-This is wrong.

1866
01:29:56.633 --> 01:29:58.900 line:82%
-It's okay.
-It's too late to be upright.

1867
01:29:58.967 --> 01:30:01.734 line:82%
-"It's too late to be upright"?
-It's too late to be upright.

1868
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.533 line:82%
-This is wrong.
-Please take it.

1869
01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:05.800 line:82%
It's my entire fortune.

1870
01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:08.367 line:82%
It's over.

1871
01:30:08.433 --> 01:30:09.767 line:82%
-Are all the spaces full?
-Yes.

1872
01:30:09.834 --> 01:30:10.667 line:82%
All the spaces are full.

1873
01:30:16.033 --> 01:30:18.834 line:82%
-The final round has ended.
-Okay.

1874
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.734 line:82%
Se-chan has a lot,
but he failed to get a bingo.

1875
01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.266 line:82%
Hey, I…

1876
01:30:23.333 --> 01:30:27.967 line:82%
I gave you so much money.

1877
01:30:28.033 --> 01:30:30.266 line:82%
I gave you so much money.

1878
01:30:30.333 --> 01:30:32.266 line:82%
-Police, over here.
-Okay.

1879
01:30:32.333 --> 01:30:34.200 line:82%
-Police, over here.
-Okay.

1880
01:30:34.266 --> 01:30:36.667 line:82%
-You can't do this.
-Here.

1881
01:30:37.233 --> 01:30:40.967 line:82%
While we do the final calculations,
please go to the room you started in.

1882
01:30:41.033 --> 01:30:42.300 line:82%
Shall we go? Okay.

1883
01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:47.600 line:82%
-There must be a catch.
-The overall situation isn't good.

1884
01:30:47.667 --> 01:30:50.133 line:82%
You accepted a lot of bribes. As for you,

1885
01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.834 line:82%
-your arrest is a given.
-Hey.

1886
01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.867 line:82%
-Your arrest is a given.
-It won't be only me.

1887
01:30:55.934 --> 01:30:57.767 line:82%
-You took a lot of bribes too.
-Jae-seok.

1888
01:30:57.834 --> 01:30:59.600 line:82%
-I didn't take as much as you.
-You punk.

1889
01:31:00.233 --> 01:31:02.734 line:82%
-I didn't take as much as you.
-If I get arrested,

1890
01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.834 line:82%
-I won't let you be.
-Me?

1891
01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:06.800 line:82%
-I won't let you be.
-Okay.

1892
01:31:06.867 --> 01:31:08.500 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1893
01:31:08.567 --> 01:31:11.066 line:82%
I don't know what's happening today.

1894
01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:13.800 line:82%
What could it be?

1895
01:31:15.033 --> 01:31:17.266 line:82%
"An honest and incorruptible nation."

1896
01:31:18.567 --> 01:31:22.266 line:82%
I have no idea what this means.

1897
01:31:23.266 --> 01:31:24.667 line:82%
What's this?

1898
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.700 line:82%
Y, W…

1899
01:31:28.934 --> 01:31:30.433 line:82%
I can't solve English clues.

1900
01:31:31.533 --> 01:31:35.433 line:82%
Let's count the money.

1901
01:31:36.567 --> 01:31:39.367 line:82%
Forty thousand, fifty thousand…

1902
01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.066 line:82%
I took too much money.

1903
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.600 line:82%
That's 28, 29, 30.
I have 300,000 won.

1904
01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.100 line:82%
Twenty-one.

1905
01:32:02.567 --> 01:32:04.667 line:82%
I accepted a lot of money.

1906
01:32:04.734 --> 01:32:05.900 line:82%
Twenty-one.

1907
01:32:08.333 --> 01:32:12.000 line:82%
I made 210,000 won today.

1908
01:32:14.166 --> 01:32:16.533 line:82%
I got my money robbed.
I used to have a lot.

1909
01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.233 line:82%
I have 230,000 won.

1910
01:32:19.967 --> 01:32:21.200 line:82%
Twenty-eight.

1911
01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.767 line:82%
It's the sweet taste of capitalism.

1912
01:32:36.967 --> 01:32:38.567 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-Yes?

1913
01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.133 line:82%
Would you return 280,000 won?

1914
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.700 line:82%
I'm sorry,

1915
01:32:46.533 --> 01:32:49.600 line:82%
but what'll happen at the end
according to the rules?

1916
01:32:49.667 --> 01:32:51.667 line:82%
I'll ask you one last time.

1917
01:32:51.734 --> 01:32:53.900 line:82%
Would you return 280,000 won?

1918
01:32:53.967 --> 01:32:55.633 line:82%
So why are you asking…

1919
01:32:56.133 --> 01:32:58.467 line:82%
Would you return 160,000 won?

1920
01:32:59.667 --> 01:33:02.900 line:82%
Where did 160,000 won come from?
Is it an arbitrary amount?

1921
01:33:02.967 --> 01:33:05.000 line:82%
Would you return 160,000 won?

1922
01:33:06.934 --> 01:33:08.300 line:82%
Why are you asking me that?

1923
01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.700 line:82%
Would you return it?

1924
01:33:10.767 --> 01:33:12.800 line:82%
What if I return it and become a fool?

1925
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.000 line:82%
I thought the amount was tied to victory.

1926
01:33:16.567 --> 01:33:18.533 line:82%
Would you return it?

1927
01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:19.533 line:82%
What?

1928
01:33:20.934 --> 01:33:23.367 line:82%
Would you return 60,000 won?

1929
01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.700 line:82%
Sixty thousand won?

1930
01:33:26.467 --> 01:33:28.300 line:82%
Why would I return 60,000 won?

1931
01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.000 line:82%
Would you return it?

1932
01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:35.834 line:82%
Hold on. What's the catch?

1933
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:38.567 line:82%
Just decide whether or not to return it.

1934
01:33:38.633 --> 01:33:41.333 line:82%
Are we getting robbed by someone above us?

1935
01:33:43.133 --> 01:33:44.000 line:82%
Is that it?

1936
01:33:44.066 --> 01:33:46.967 line:82%
In that case,
would you return 280,000 won?

1937
01:33:47.033 --> 01:33:48.266 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1938
01:33:49.033 --> 01:33:51.767 line:82%
I can't believe these people's antics.

1939
01:33:51.834 --> 01:33:54.166 line:82%
You made me look like a bad person.

1940
01:33:55.467 --> 01:33:57.934 line:82%
If I return 160,000 won,
only 50,000 won will remain.

1941
01:34:02.834 --> 01:34:05.467 line:82%
If I return the money…

1942
01:34:05.533 --> 01:34:07.633 line:82%
Would it be bad?

1943
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.934 line:82%
What are the final results?

1944
01:34:18.734 --> 01:34:20.367 line:82%
The scale keeps getting bigger.

1945
01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:26.266 line:82%
The final results will be revealed.

1946
01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:27.667 line:82%
The final results?

1947
01:34:27.734 --> 01:34:29.033 line:82%
I had a lot.

1948
01:34:38.033 --> 01:34:40.266 line:82%
-What's going on?
-My goodness.

1949
01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:42.433 line:82%
-What's going on?
-My goodness.

1950
01:34:43.033 --> 01:34:46.800 line:82%
-What's going on?
-My goodness.

1951
01:34:46.867 --> 01:34:48.200 line:82%
-What's going on?
-Gosh.

1952
01:34:49.333 --> 01:34:51.700 line:82%
Gosh, everything is getting destroyed.

1953
01:34:51.767 --> 01:34:54.133 line:82%
-Everything is getting destroyed.
-What's going on?

1954
01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.266 line:82%
-Everything is getting destroyed.
-What's going on?

1955
01:34:57.033 --> 01:34:59.900 line:82%
-What?
-I knew this would happen.

1956
01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.533 line:82%
Everything is getting destroyed.

1957
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:09.667 line:82%
What's going on?

1958
01:35:10.233 --> 01:35:11.400 line:82%
What's this?

1959
01:35:11.467 --> 01:35:13.000 line:82%
What?

1960
01:35:14.233 --> 01:35:17.567 line:82%
-Gosh.
-What was that?

1961
01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.166 line:82%
What's the theme today?

1962
01:35:29.233 --> 01:35:32.333 line:82%
-What? Everything collapsed.
-It collapsed.

1963
01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.500 line:82%
Faulty construction?

1964
01:35:34.567 --> 01:35:37.233 line:82%
It's no wonder
the construction was faulty.

1965
01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:40.667 line:82%
-There are many cracks in the walls.
-No way.

1966
01:35:40.734 --> 01:35:42.066 line:82%
What's this?

1967
01:35:42.133 --> 01:35:44.567 line:82%
-What's YNT?
-YTN?

1968
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.900 line:82%
-What's this?
-Y, N, T.

1969
01:35:46.967 --> 01:35:48.133 line:82%
Y, N, T.

1970
01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:50.967 line:82%
I think it's gotten bigger.

1971
01:35:51.633 --> 01:35:54.133 line:82%
Is it a crack on the wall?

1972
01:36:02.333 --> 01:36:03.633 line:82%
What?

1973
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.834 line:82%
What's up with the crow sounds?

1974
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.400 line:82%
What?

1975
01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:14.500 line:82%
-What's this?
-Will ghosts come out?

1976
01:36:17.767 --> 01:36:19.734 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-What?

1977
01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:20.633 line:82%
Who splashed water?

1978
01:36:23.767 --> 01:36:26.934 line:82%
They're so obsessed with the bingo
that they don't care about the smoke.

1979
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:27.834 line:82%
Right now…

1980
01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:32.266 line:82%
Listen. There's smoke coming out,
but you're still trying to get a bingo.

1981
01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:33.700 line:82%
All right. We saw it.

1982
01:36:33.767 --> 01:36:37.734 line:82%
Money has blinded them.
The apartment is burning.

1983
01:36:42.033 --> 01:36:43.767 line:82%
That explains the leakage.

1984
01:36:43.834 --> 01:36:47.900 line:82%
-That explains the leakage and smoke.
-The wind too.

1985
01:36:47.967 --> 01:36:49.834 line:82%
It was about faulty construction.

1986
01:36:50.867 --> 01:36:56.166 line:82%
The traders and public officials
took bribes.

1987
01:36:56.233 --> 01:36:57.767 line:82%
Of course, the construction was faulty.

1988
01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.200 line:82%
Items got taken out.

1989
01:37:00.266 --> 01:37:02.400 line:82%
Even with the clue, I had no idea.

1990
01:37:02.467 --> 01:37:05.033 line:82%
The secret of the apartment today
was based

1991
01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:08.900 line:82%
on what took place on April 8, 1970,
in Changcheon-dong, Mapo-gu.

1992
01:37:08.967 --> 01:37:12.834 line:82%
It was the collapse
of the Wau Citizen Apartment Complex.

1993
01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:15.233 line:82%
The Wau Citizen Apartment Complex.
I've heard of it.

1994
01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.433 line:82%
-I know the incident.
-The collapse.

1995
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:21.433 line:82%
The collapse of the Wau Citizen Apartment
that took place in the '70s

1996
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.900 line:82%
caused quite a stir in society.

1997
01:37:23.967 --> 01:37:25.734 line:82%
That was the story of the day.

1998
01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.133 line:82%
A four-month-old apartment
in Changcheon-dong, Mapo-gu

1999
01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.700 line:82%
called the Wau Citizen Apartment Complex

2000
01:37:40.767 --> 01:37:45.100 line:82%
collapsed with a roaring sound
at 6 a.m. this morning.

2001
01:37:45.166 --> 01:37:46.433 line:82%
Due to this incident,

2002
01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:50.166 line:82%
33 apartment residents lost their lives.

2003
01:37:50.233 --> 01:37:52.100 line:82%
WAU CITIZEN APARTMENT COLLAPSES

2004
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.500 line:82%
INVESTIGATION BEGINS

2005
01:38:05.367 --> 01:38:07.367 line:82%
To an honest and incorruptible nation.

2006
01:38:07.433 --> 01:38:08.667 line:82%
Incorruptibility.

2007
01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:14.367 line:82%
You don't need to see anything else.

2008
01:38:14.433 --> 01:38:16.867 line:82%
-Pass.
-Pass. Incorruptibility.

2009
01:38:16.934 --> 01:38:19.133 line:82%
I just received 10,000 won.

2010
01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:31.633 line:82%
FOUR INCLUDING THE FORMER

FOLLOWING THE APARTMENT COLLAPSE

2032

Had the construction been done properly,

2033
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.400 line:82%
the apartments would've been built
like that.

2036
01:39:59.667 --> 01:40:02.367 line:82%

-I see.
-I see.

I can't believe these people's antics.

2046
01:40:28.667 --> 01:40:31.600 line:82%
I'm the mayor, okay?

2047
01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:33.166 line:82%
Three…

2048
01:40:33.233 --> 01:40:34.567 line:82%

I'll return it.

2050
01:40:40.333 --> 01:40:43.166 line:82%
I'll return it. Let me return it.

2051
01:40:43.233 --> 01:40:45.900 line:82%
I was supposed to be
the cane of the people.

2052
01:40:45.967 --> 01:40:49.066 line:82%
I'm ashamed of what I did today.

2053
01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:54.867 line:82%
I had that realization a while ago.
Please let me return it.

2054
01:40:58.033 --> 01:40:59.600 line:82%
Do what you need to do.

2055

01:41:07.266 --> 01:41:08.333 line:82%
No.

2058
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.533 line:82%
I won't return it.
It was hard to make this money.

2059
01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.834 line:82%
It was so hard to make 60,000 won.

2060
01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:15.467 line:82%
Why would I return it?

2061
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.734 line:82%
-Yes!
-Yes!

2062
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.533 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-My goodness.

2063
01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.166 line:82%
Didn't you return it?

2064
01:41:23.233 --> 01:41:26.000 line:82%
You should've done it.
YEONJUN, why didn't you return it?

2065
01:41:26.066 --> 01:41:28.500 line:82%
-The amount was too large.
-My goodness.

2066
01:41:28.567 --> 01:41:30.166 line:82%
-How much did you have?
-280,000 won.

2067
01:41:30.233 --> 01:41:31.667 line:82%
-Unbelievable.
-My goodness.

2068
01:41:32.166 --> 01:41:36.266 line:82%
Although it happened in the '70s,

2069
01:41:36.333 --> 01:41:38.867 line:82%
so many people lost their lives.

2070
01:41:38.934 --> 01:41:43.233 line:82%
It was an incident
that should never have happened

2071
01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:44.533 line:82%
in our history.

2072
01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.233 line:82%
-It was where people lived.
-I know.

2073
01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.000 line:82%
The Wooam Apartment collapse in Cheongju…

2074

Plasterboard fell in the apartment…

2075
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.500 line:82%
Insulating materials and rebars…

2076
01:41:54.567 --> 01:41:57.166 line:82%
Many builders got arrested
for poor construction.

2077
01:41:57.233 --> 01:42:01.166 line:82%
They had subcontracted their work
to another company.

2078
01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:24.133 line:82%
…have given up on humanity.

2079
01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:26.266 line:82%
…capitalism…

2080
01:42:29.767 --> 01:42:30.967 line:82%
Hello.

2081
01:42:31.033 --> 01:42:32.567 line:82%
She's foaming at the mouth.

2082
01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:38.333 line:82%
-This is the sound.
-What is it?

2083
01:42:40.033 --> 01:42:43.266 line:82%
Why? Please don't do this! I'm scared.

2084
01:42:43.333 --> 01:42:45.200 line:82%
-Call 119.
-Call 119.

2085
01:42:45.266 --> 01:42:46.900 line:82%
-Here they come.
-Here.

2086
01:42:48.567 --> 01:42:50.300 line:82%
I think they rehearsed it.

2087
01:42:50.367 --> 01:42:53.100 line:82%
-They had good teamwork.
-It was systematic.

2088
01:42:56.934 --> 01:42:58.734 line:82%
Let me go.

2089
01:42:58.800 --> 01:42:59.934 line:82%
Hey.

2090
01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.600 line:82%
It's not yours!

2091
01:43:03.033 --> 01:43:04.433 line:82%
Jung-ha, move out of the way.

2092
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.266 line:82%
I'll move out of the way.

2093
01:43:07.333 --> 01:43:08.667 line:82%
Don't take it.

2094
01:43:09.233 --> 01:43:10.867 line:82%
That isn't how you do it.

2095
01:43:10.934 --> 01:43:14.500 line:82%
I know that there's a culprit.
It's not me.

2096
01:43:14.567 --> 01:43:15.967 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

2097
01:43:16.033 --> 01:43:17.200 line:82%
Hey.

2098
01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.600 line:82%
Let's unveil the truth.

2099
01:43:19.667 --> 01:43:21.066 line:82%
Hello.

2100
01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:23.400 line:82%

No.

2103
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.700 line:82%
Now, it'll…

2104
01:43:28.767 --> 01:43:30.000 line:82%
I got chills.

2105
01:43:30.066 --> 01:43:31.066 line:82%
Gosh, you startled me.
