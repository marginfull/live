After which they waive any and all rightto future applications.

Finally, you are reminded:

123

over the next seven daysis highly confidential.

125
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,916
And what are we being assessed on exactly?

126
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,416
It's just a little... opaque.

127
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,333
-Opaque?-[Mia] Not opaque...

128
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,833
I just mean,

129
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,833
not clear.

130
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,875
-That is what opaque means.-What Mia's trying to say is--

131
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,458
We couldn't find any specific criteria,that's what I'm trying to say.

132
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,375
The less you know in advance, the better.

133
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,375
[Virginia]I want to get to know the real you.

134
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,041
-Is that a good idea?-[Virginia] Yes.

135
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,000
I was joking.

136
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,291
Hm. [she giggles]

137
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,791
Good.

138
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,583
Humour is important.

139
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:11,291
I'm sure that everyone says this,

140
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,041
but I...

141
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,666
We would be really great parents.

142
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,666
Everyone does say that.

143
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,875
So, who's first?

144
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,541
On a scale of one to ten,

145
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,083
how would you rate your current levelsof satisfaction with the relationship?

146
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,166
Nine, at least.

147
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,333
Describe Mia with three words.

148
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,750
Funny. Smart.

149
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,875
Sharp. She can bea little sharp, but I like that.

150
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,125
Keeps me on my toes.

151
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,875
We were in a laband he was absorbed in some code.

152
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,458
And I don't know whyI took this moment to tell him,

153
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,583
but I said "I love you,"it just popped out and he said,

154
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,375
"That's right." [laughing]

155
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,125
How often do you have sex?

156
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,791
Once or twice a week.

157
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,541
How are we defining sex?

158
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,666
[Virginia] Oral, manual, anal or full.

159
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,041
[low thrum]

160
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,958
Do you achieve regular climax?

161
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:25,958
Yes.

162
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,625
[Virginia] Every time?

163
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,291
Would you like some water?

164
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,666
Is that part of the test?

165
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,833
No, just water.

166
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,791
I'm fine. Thank you.

167
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,208
Tell me about your mother.

168
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,833
She expected a lot from me, but...

169
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,666
it was good.

170
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,833
She was sent to the Old Worldwhen my sister and I were little.

171
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,083
So I only have a few memories.

172
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,291
-She was a dissident?-Yes.

173
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,125
Do you have any differenceswith the State?

174
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:04,708
No. Does it not say this in my file?

175
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,958
[Virginia] Why do you want a child?

176
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,458
We know how lucky we are. We feel...

177
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,500
We feel fulfilled...

178
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,958
...professionally and personallyand we want to share that.

179
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,791
Every child deservesthe best possible start.

180
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,375
That sounds a little prepared.

181
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,458
[Aaryan laughs softly]

182
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:27,416
It's our duty to help nurturethe future of this society.

183
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,541
It's a big thing, so, yes, we're prepared.

184
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,958
[Mia] I want to give a childwhat I never had.

185
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,875
[soft choral singing]

186
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,958
And what was that?

187
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,750
A sense of belonging.

188
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,291
You don't feel you belong?

189
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,250
Now, yeah. No, I meant as a child.

190
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,083
[choral singing continues]

191
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,125
Everything's as per the instructions.

192
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,333
We thought that we could use this...Not that we're presuming, but we...

193
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,958
[wind whistles]

194
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,708
[Virginia sighs]

195
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,625
[mattress rustles]

196
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,583
Do you hear that?

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,958
-Loose springs.-But there's no springs in that mattress.

198
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,666
Do you have somewhere else?

199
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,416
Yes, but there's actually no springs--

200
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,875
You take our room. We'll sleep in here.

201
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,125
-[Virginia] Don't go to any trouble.-It's no trouble.

202
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,083
Yeah, yeah.

203
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,666
It's no trouble at all.

204
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,958
Better.

205
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,875
[low thrumming]

206
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,625
[thrumming stops]

207
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,291
[low hum]

208
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,666
[soft whooshing]

209
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,500
-[Mia] I call it Aaryan's thinking cave.-[Aaryan] Sjøhus, open Cooper slate.

210
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,666
I'm working on the cat's texture.

211
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,750
This is all virtually generated.

212
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,875
[gently echoing] So, um, this iswhere you designed the virtual pets?

213
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,125
Not the prototypes,they were back at the university,

214
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,833
but, yes, the second generation.

215
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,375
It's funny, I was in this seat right herewhen it struck me--

216
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,958
[Virginia] And what about you?

217
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,250
Do you have a work space?

218
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,250
Yes. Sure.

219
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,208
[gentle chuckle]

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,583
[female voice vocalising]

221
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,916
[percussion]

222
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,750
[wind whistles]

223
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,750
The airflow system allowsdifferent micro-climates to coexist,

224
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,708
that's what allows for the variety.

225
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,333
[water trickles and drips]

226
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,875
It's very, um...

227
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,250
colourful.

228
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,583
Colourful?

229
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,583
This is a template for sustainablefood production everywhere.

230
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,791
-It's a laboratory.-Colourful's right.

231
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,958
Nature wants to be noticed,but she's deceptive.

232
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,458
Underneath her beautiful façade,she provides energy and shelter.

233
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,875
And this greenhouse alone

234
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:41,083
contains over 1,000 different speciesof plants and algae able to--

235
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,416
What's this one?

236
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,458
Oh... paphiopedilum.

237
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,375
It's also known as the Venus Orchid.

238
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,875
It's the oldest of its kind.Some live to be 100.

239
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,958
My mother gave it to me.It's the only thing I have of hers.

240
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,166
Your mother?

241
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,125
Sorry, can you be careful?

242
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,583
-[Virginia scoffs]-Sorry, she's sensitive.

243
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,291
I'll need full access to all areas.

244
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,125
But you don't mean...

245
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,625
Full access.

246
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,416
It's already done. I programmed Sjøhusto recognise your voice. Sjøhus?

247
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,333
[Sjøhus] Welcome, Virginia.

248
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,250
I'll also need samples of urine, saliva,blood, hair, vaginal mucus and semen.

249
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,541
[percussion]

250
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,625
I thought we already gave these.

251
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,208
[rhythmic slapping sound]

252
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,041
[Aaryan grunts softly]

253
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,500
[sighs]

254
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,625
[Virginia] You'd be surprisedhow many people cheat.

255
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,375
[clears her throat]

256
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,958
It'll do.

257
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,916
[percussion ends]

258
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,333
Mia synthesises all the nutrients herself.

259
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,375
We can produce crops all year roundwithout depleting the soil.

260
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,583
May I? A little wine?

261
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,625
She's found a way of harnessingthe soil microbials into energy

262
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,500
that powers all our work.

263
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,666
[chewing]

264
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,416
How did you get your scar?

265
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,875
The pet cull hadn't happened long beforeand some people thought

266
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,916
I was somehow responsible, so...

267
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,125
some activists decided to intervene.

268
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:51,250
Which is insane because Aaryan developedvirtual pets as a solution to the cull,

269
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,625
he wasn't responsible for it.

270
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,083
The pet cull was part

271
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,250
of the disease preventionand resource conservation programme.

272
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,416
The problem was the State underestimated

273
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,583
the psychological importanceof companionship

274
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,125
when they exterminated all the pets.

275
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,958
Especially during a timeof upheaval, so...

276
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,125
I was taskedwith creating an alternative. I did.

277
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,875
Just not everybody saw it that way.

278
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,666
These people firebombedthe university research lab that...

279
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,583
Aaryan was working in.

280
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,875
I-I jumped out of a third floor window.

281
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,583
Broke my shoulder,my collar bone, three vertebrae...

282
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,333
And these burn scars.

283
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,000
That must've been terrifying.

284
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,875
[Mia] He's still traumatised by fire.

285
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,333
What happened to the people responsible?

286
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,458
-They were sent to the Old World.-Yeah, they got what they deserved.

287
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,041
Your mother was sent to the Old World.

288
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,916
Did she get what she deserved?

289
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,208
[wind continues whistling]

290
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,708
[whispers] All that stuff about my mother.

291
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,583
She's just pushing buttons, okay?It's obviously how it works.

292
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,500
We just need to stay cool, not react.

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,375
She likes you.

294
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,291
[chuckles] You jealous?

295
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,500
Yeah, embarrassingly so. I am.

296
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,291
Maybe I can make you not jealous.

297
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,458
Light, Sjøhus.

298
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,125
[Aaryan moans softly]

299
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,416
[chuckles] Being in this single bedmakes me feel like a teenager again.

300
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,583
Pervert.

301
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,541
[chuckles softly]

302
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,166
Get on your back.

303
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,250
Ow! You just kneed me in the balls.

304
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,416
I'm sorry, do you want to complainor do you want your cock in my mouth?

305
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,833
What was the first option?

306
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,416
[laughs] Yeah.

307
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,291
-You gonna fold those?-[chuckles]

308
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,250
Don't make me laugh.I'm being very, very serious right now.

309
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,833
Okay.

310
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,083
[moans softly]

311
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,791
Oh... Oh, fuck!

312
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,958
Virginia! Virginia!

313
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,125
[Mia] Oh, my God.

314
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,666
[Mia pants]

315
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,083
I need to assessall aspects of your relationship.

316
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,708
It's fine.

317
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,375
Seriously?

318
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,166
[Virginia] Just imagine I'm not here.

319
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,416
[soft vocalising]

320
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,708
[Mia whispers] What? No.

321
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,333
[choral vocalising]

322
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,125
-Aaryan?-Yeah?

323
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,666
I... Fuck.

324
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,083
[vocalising distorts]

325
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,458
[Aaryan moans]

326
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,208
[discordant vocalising]

327
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,916
[Aaryan pants]

328
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,375
[Aaryan groans softly]

329
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,416
[electronic chime]

330
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,416
Oh, hey.

331
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,500
Um, these all came.Do you know what they are?

332
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,625
You sleep okay?

333
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,750
[crunching]

334
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,333
[percussion]

335
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,041
[percussion speeds up]

[percussion ends]

00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,000
[Virginia sighs]

338
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,208
You gonna eat?

339
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,250
[Virginia laughs]

340
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,375
[Mia and Aaryan] Mm.

341
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,000
Why don't you try? Yeah? You wanna try?

342
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:15,500
Yeah, that's, that's...That's really good.

343
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,166
It's really yummy.

344
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,666
Whoa, what the f...?

345
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:24,500
-You shouted at me.-[Mia] I did not. I did not--

346
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,958
-You did, you shouted.-It was not. No, I...

347
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,500
-I raised my voice.-Did.

348
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,625
-[Mia] I did not. I raised my voice.-Did.

349
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,500
[Mia] It's just not the same thing.

350
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,291
-Did.-[Mia] No, I didn't.

351
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,333
-Did!-It was a little loud.

352
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,500
-Did!-Ha! No, it was not!

353
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,083
-Did. Did. Did.-[Mia] Okay, Virginia.

354
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,291
-Did.-[Mia] That's very cute, very charming.

355
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,916
-Did.-[Mia] Okay.

356
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,416
-[kicking table] Did. Did. Did.-Virginia.

357
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,416
Virginia, could you stop?

358
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,541
-Virginia, please stop.-Did.

359
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,166
-[Mia] Virginia.-Did.

360
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,625
-[Mia] Virginia.-Yeah.

361
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,500
-[Mia] Virginia!-Did! Did! Did!

362
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,916
Virginia!

363
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,375
[wind continues whistling]

364
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:04,041
Okay, that was... that was a shout, yeah?

365

[Aaryan] Hey! Why don't we try a game?

368
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,041
It's a train.

371
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,208
Oh, it's going really fast.

372
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh, is it gonna crash?

373
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,958
Oh... Or it could go in the tunnel.

374
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,041
You don't want it to crash now. Come on.

375
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,250

I mean, it has to be, right?

473
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:13,666
[Mia] No, I don't know yet,but we will figure it out.

474
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,291
[Aaryan] Well, if we check the--

475
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,875
Does this say which orange piece

476
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:20,458
we're supposed to usefor the bottom with the greens?

477
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,958
The grey pieces are the piecesthat actually that link it.

478
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,083
-These connect... the orange.-They're the connectors.

479
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:29,708
No. The orange pieces, they just siton top. They're not doing any connecting.

480

488
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,916

-Thank you. It was a team effort.-[Virginia] Would you get my bag?

517
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,875

Hm.

When I was younger,I had the stupidest looking cocker-poodle.

539
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:21,833
When it was time to hand over the petsfor the cull,

540
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:25,666
the idea of him dying in a roomwith some stranger was too much, so...

541
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,500
I got hold of some pentobarbitaland I did it myself.

542
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,583
I remember him looking at me

543
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:44,916
with his big, trusting eyes.

544
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,583

00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,416
a dinner invite for tonight.

731
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,041
[Mia] Someplace nice, I hope.

732
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,708
Uh... It's here. We're the hosts.

733
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,208
[Mia] What are you talking about?

734
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,208
[female voice vocalising softly]

735
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:57,916
[whispered, rhythmic vocal sounds come in]

736
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:02,291
[percussion comes in]

737
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:10,333
[clanging]

738
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:12,333
[rhythmic vocal sounds intensify]

739
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,916
[low rumbling]

740
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,791
[electronic chime]

741
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:31,000
[Sjøhus] Your first guests have arrived.

742
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:35,208
-Hi.-Hi. Come on in.

743
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:37,666
[music fades]

744
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,583
Hello.

745
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:41,000
-[Mia] Hey.-Hi, Aaryan.

746
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:43,291
Hi. Hi. Mia, this is Serena.

747
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,958
Oh. Yeah, the Serena.

748
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:49,625
Hi. I've heard a lot of great things.I'm Mia.

749
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:51,708
-It's really nice to meet you.-Likewise.

750
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:54,791
-This is Holly and Amelia.-Holly, hi.

751
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,416
And Amelia.

752
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:59,583
It is...it's really such a pleasure to meet you.

753
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,000
Are we going in?

754
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,708
-[both laugh]-Sorry. Kids... Amelia!

755
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,875
I'm gonna go make sure everyone...

756
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:10,125
-Sure.-Okay.

757
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,958
[footsteps recede]

758
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,708
[Mia] Can I get you something to drink?

759
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,333
-We have wine, juice...-[Holly] Oh, thank you. Amelia...

760
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,125
How's Assessment going so far?

761
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:20,166
[indistinct chatter in background]

762
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,458
[sighs] It's a fucking nightmare.

763
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:26,708
[chuckles] We thought we werea disaster and then we got Amelia.

764
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,875
You'll be fine.

765
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:32,000
[indistinct chatter continues]

766
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,708
[Holly] Serena,you have to come see this.

767
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,875
-I should... Yeah.-Mm.

768
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,708
[Sjøhus] More guests have arrived.

769
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,500
Hi. I'm Aaryan.

770
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:42,333
-I'm Walter, and this is---Don't bother with all that.

771
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:43,666
We shan't meet again.

772
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,250
-[Amelia] They always staring?-[Serena] They've not seen a kid in ages.

773
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,666
-[Walter] Seen her?-[Walter's partner] Stealing our oxygen.

774
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,333
[Amelia] There's neveranyone to play with.

775
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,458
-[crash]-Oh, Jesus!

776
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:53,708
-Welcome!-[guests groan]

777
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,750
This is Virginia,

778
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,500
our Assessor.

779
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:01,458
-Mia. It's been too long.-[Walter's partner] Any chance of a drink?

780
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,083
[electronic chime]

781
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:05,916
-How do you two...?-I was Walter's lab assistant.

782
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,083
Makes sense.

783
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:10,666
-[Walter] Mia was a brilliant assistant.-[Walter's partner] High praise.

784
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,250
Regrettably, she abandoned mefor a more exciting scientist.

785
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:17,375
-[Holly] Don't stare, sweetie.-I wanted to pursue my own work.

786
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:20,250
I still bear the scarsfrom your departure.

787
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:23,666
[scoffs] Scratches, darling.All down your back, if I recall.

788
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,250
Can I get anyone anything?

789
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,750
-Is there alcohol in this?-Yes, a bit. Is that all right?

790
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,000
No.

791
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:31,083
I'm gonna need something stronger.

792
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,375
-So, about Walter...-It's okay. You don't have to explain.

793
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,625
When I was his student,

794
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:40,916
we had an affairthat I think Evie knows about.

795
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,291
I'm pretty sure she knows about it.

796
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:46,875
Well, it was completely inappropriateand he probably exploited me,

797
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:49,791
but, you know, he was actuallya pretty good professor.

798
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:51,208
[breathes shakily]

799
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,083
-Look at me, I'm shaking.-Mia...

800
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:55,958
These people are here to throw us off.

801
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:57,375
That's the game.

802
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,625
We just have to stay calm.

803
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:01,583
[inhales] Okay.

804
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,666
[Evie] Can't believeI have to endure this.

805
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,666
[Mia] So, Amelia, do you go to school?

806
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,625
-Amelia self-educates.-No schools in our district.

807
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:11,541
It's better, though.You get to follow your own interests.

808
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,833
-[Holly] Amelia's an artist.-[Mia] Oh!

809
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:15,125
Abstracts, mainly.

810
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:18,458
Well, I would love to seeyour work sometime.

811
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,541
Do you show your art at any exhibitions?

812
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:23,375
[Amelia] Not really. But I want to.

813
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,833
-[Aaryan] Virginia?-[Mia] Virginia.

814
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,583
-[Aaryan] Virginia, could you...-It's okay.

815
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:29,208
-[Amelia] Is she okay?-[Virginia chokes]

816
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:32,625
-[Serena] I'm sure she's fine.-[Evie] Oh, my God.

817
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,500
-[Mia] Okay, sweetie.-[Amelia] She doesn't look fine.

818
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:36,625
[electronic chime]

819
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:38,666
[Sjøhus] Aaryan, your mother has arrived.

820
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,208
[Aaryan sighs deeply]

821
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,458
Don't start.First thing I knew about this...

822
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,750
-What the hell is that?-Mom.

823
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,750
No, you stop calling me that.

824
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:49,250
You're not a child anymore.

825
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,208
It's Ambika, not Mom.

826
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:55,875
I was having a perfectly nice timein the gym when I got the call.

827
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,875
But as we all know,

828
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:01,375
an invitation from the Stateisn't really an invitation at all.

829
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:03,125
Can you just promise me one thing?

830
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,333
Don't say anything stupid or embarrassing?

831
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:08,666
You're so like your father.

832
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:11,416
-Oh, Ambika, hi! How was your trip?-Hi!

833
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,125
Nice to see you too, Mom.

834
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:15,833
-[Mia] How's work, Ambika?-I'm not allowed to say.

835
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,083
[Walter] Why? Is it very secret?

836
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:19,416
[Ambika] Ah, no.

837
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,750
Aaryan just asked me not to talkin case I embarrass him.

838
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,541
-[Aaryan] I was joking.-[Serena] I'm sure he was just teasing.

839
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:26,750
-Virginia...-Stop it!

840
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,583
I designed the modular estates.

841
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:29,666
Virginia!

842
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,458
-Oh, I hear they're fantastic.-[Virginia screams]

843
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:34,208
How old is she supposed to be?

844
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:36,500
-Okay, I'm gonna clear plates.-[Mia] I'll help.

845
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:40,375
Thank you.

846
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,291
[Evie] Are we pretending this is okay?

847
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,208
Assessment is everybody's right,whether we agree with it or not.

848
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:48,291
-It's an indulgence.-How?

849
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,958
'Cause we don't have the resources.

850
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,458
[Serena] That's for the State to decide,not you.

851
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:56,083
They reengineered Senoxidineto prevent reproduction,

852
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,083
as well as aging and disease.

853
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,750
-What about you, Holly?-[Amelia] She's sliding under the table.

854
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:03,916
-What keeps you occupied?-Holly monitors border activity.

855
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
-[Walter] That's fascinating.-[Mia] What is?

856
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:07,625
[Serena] Holly works by the border.

857
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:10,208
Honestly, I'm nowhere near,I just see the reports.

858
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,500
What's to report?I thought they were just dying.

859
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:17,625
Well, there are indications thatlimited tracts of land may be survivable.

860
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:19,875
-Are you serious?-How long are they surviving?

861
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:22,541
-[Holly] The data's limited.-[Ambika] How long do people think?

862
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:24,500
-Years.-[Holly] We don't know for sure.

863
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:26,000
So they're reproducing?

864
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:29,583
-Once the Senoxidine wears off, in theory.-[Virginia squeals]

865
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,458
-We're trying to find that out.-[Mia] Aaryan.

866
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,708
How would they have babieswithout Assessment?

867
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:36,083
-From their own wombs.-[Evie] Going back to the Dark Ages.

868
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:38,708
-[Amelia] It's not forbidden?-[Mia] Virginia, I'm asking nicely...

869
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,833
-Think of the pain.-Yeah.

870
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:45,250
They must livesuch short and unhappy lives.

871
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:48,125
[Holly] I'm really not supposedto talk about any of this.

872
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:50,666
We should be reducing the population,not increasing it.

873
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:55,041
I'm not sure this is the occasionto talk about population control.

874
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,875
This is the exact occasionto talk about population control!

875
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,125
-[Mia] Okay, Virginia...-[Virginia cries out]

876
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,708
-[Walter] Oh, shit.-[Evie] Control that brat.

877
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:05,166
[Ambika] It was not like this in my day.

878
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,666
[Aaryan] Sorry about this.

879
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,541
[Mia whispers] It's okay.It's okay, I'm not mad.

880
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,166
I'd like to propose a toast.

881
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,958
[Ambika] A toast!

882
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:20,125
To Mia.

883
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:23,500
And Aaryan. The future.

884
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,916
-Oh, my God!-[all] The future!

885
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,833
Second time lucky, then?

886
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:31,708
Sorry, what do you mean second time?

887
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:35,250
Well, you must know thatAaryan and Serena applied?

888
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,375
-[Mia] Oh...-Obviously, it didn't work out.

889
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:42,666
[Walter chuckles softly]I guess things just got interesting.

890
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,166
-[Evie] She didn't know that?-No, I didn't know that.

891
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:49,291
We didn't get far at all. I pulled outbefore the end of the questionnaire.

892
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:50,875
So Aaryan wanted to continue?

893
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:53,291
It didn't mean anything. I don't mean...

894
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:56,750
It's fine. He's right. It didn'tmean anything. It was a mistake.

895
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:58,833
-I'm gonna make some space.-[Aaryan] Mia, this...

896
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:04,041
Oh, wow. Yeah, the future!

897
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:06,625
-[Amelia] The future!-[Evie] Hooray.

898
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,958
-[Serena] Ah, Jesus.-[Evie] Well done, Ambika.

899
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:10,458
[Walter chuckles]

900
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:12,416
[indistinct chatter]

901
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,375
[footsteps approach]

902
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,791
I didn't want to upset you.

903
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:26,250
Can we talk about this later?

904
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:33,333
Mia?

905
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:37,208
[Holly] If you're concernedabout resources, stop taking Senoxidine.

906
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:38,791
[Serena] I think that's a good idea.

907
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:42,125
[Walter] Yeah, what a great idea.Let's grow old and die.

908
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:44,375
Why not throw ourselves into the abyss?

909
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:47,458
-But maybe let's finish dessert first.-Hands up:

910
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:50,083
Who wants to dieto make room for the new people?

911
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:51,458
-Yeah.-Oh, come on.

912
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,291
-What about madam over there?-[Amelia] Me?

913
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:55,541
Why not? Last one in, first out.

914
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:57,375
-[Amelia gasps]-God, you're a witch!

915
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:00,333
You'll find witches are in the Old Worldwith the other enemies of progress.

916
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:03,083
Enough! Mia's motherwas sent to the Old World.

917
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:06,166
Oh, I know.I know exactly what happened to her.

918
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:10,000
She was exiled for spreadinglies and misinformation.

919
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:12,750
-She deserved exactly what she had coming.-Hey!

920
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,083
-Don't talk to her like that.-Oh, spare me your outrage.

921
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:19,750
You're all too youngto remember the border, aren't you?

922
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,458
[Amelia] You were alive before the border?

923
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:22,916
How old are you?

924
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,250
I'm 153.

925
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:28,833
-What was it like?-You don't want to know.

926
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,125
You really do not want to know.

927
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,708
-I do.-[Aaryan] Virginia, sit down, please.

928
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:37,333
-[Evie] Oh, God, what now?-[Virginia] I wanna know.

929
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,833
-[Holly] It's okay. Stay there, Amelia.-[Evie] Oh, well...

930
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,250
-Virginia!- I can tell you from...

931
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,625
-Oh, God. Ow.-[Holly] Don't worry, it's fine.

932
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,250
[Evie] You comfortable? Right.

933
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,875
[Virginia] Hm.

934
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,875
In the beginning,

935
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:55,375
all anyone could talk about

936
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:57,708
was how nice it wasto finally have decent summers.

937
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,375
And then the summers never stopped.

938
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:02,916
Unbearable heat,

939
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:05,000
endless storms...

940
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,333
No crops, no shelter. Nothing habitable.

941
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:10,916
[melancholic music]

942
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,125
Famine. Disease.

943
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,416
Countless species extinct.

944
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,125
Did you knowwe tore each other apart over scraps?

945
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,375
We'd finally done it:

946
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:26,208
destroyed ourselves.

947
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:28,750
All for greed and indifference.

948
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:32,041
And then one day,those of us who were left,

949
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:34,291
we found a solution:

950
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:36,708
a New World.

951
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:41,666
We had to be smarter than we were before,because there wasn't room for everyone.

952
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:44,541
Choices had to be made.

953
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,583
It wasn't kind or nice,

954
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,125
but it was necessary for survival.

955
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,458
You think because we're ableto drink wine and...

956
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,333
grow crops in greenhouses,

957
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:02,875
and breed brats in bags,

958
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,250
you've somehow conquered nature.

959
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,916
You're wrong.

960
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,666
It's borrowed.

961
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,875
And anything you take from nature,

962
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,416
sooner or later, she'll want it back.

963
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,708
So, forgive me if I don't smile politely

964
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:21,833
and go alongwith this whole fucking charade,

965
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:24,625
while you risk everything we have

966
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:27,791
just to scratchsome vain and vestigial itch.

967
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,791
Fucking hubris will be the death of us.

968
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,500
All of us.

969
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,000
I want no part of that.

970
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,666
There we are. That's the story.

971
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,041
Was it fun?

972
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:41,708
[liquid trickles]

973
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,250
[Virginia chuckles softly]

974
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:47,375
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Get off.-[Ambika] What happened?

975
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,875
-Get off me!-[Mia] Hey...

976
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:53,166
[Evie] She pissed all over me,the fucking little bitch!

977
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,583
-Oh, my God.-[Ambika] Here. Take this.

978
00:59:55,666 --> 00:59:57,750
[Holly] I'm sure you all feel just awful.

979
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:00,250
[Serena] Can I get something to clean up?

980
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:03,666
-[Evie] We know it runs in the family.-[Walter] Evie, please.

981
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,625
-What does?-[Evie] Being a bad fucking mother.

982
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,625
-[Aaryan] Mia!-[Evie cries out]

983
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,958
-[Amelia] Is Assessment always like this?-[Holly] Oh, my God.

984
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:15,375
[Evie] Fucking barbarians!

985
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,583
[Aaryan] Hey...

986
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,291
[choral singing comes in]

987
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:35,041
[door opens]

988
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,791
[Mia] It's late. It's time for bed.

989
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,333
[music and singing fades]

990
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:57,333
Evie was mean to me.

991
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:09,458
Thank you, Mummy.

992
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,125
[music and singing resumes]

993
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:13,875
[Mia] Hm.

994
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:16,500
[Virginia chuckles softly]

995
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,916
Hm, no, uh...

996
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,041
I...

997
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,125
[soft chuckle]

998
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:29,750
Aren't you a silly?

999
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,666
[music and singing fades]

1000
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,750
[wind howls]

1001
01:01:57,791 --> 01:02:01,291
I didn't realise I had to tell youevery detail about my life before we met.

1002
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,958
-Assessment's not a detail.-[sighs in exasperation]

1003
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:11,416
Mia, it didn't mean anything, okay?Serena said it herself, it meant nothing.

1004
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,000
-It is not "nothing."-Okay, maybe it's not nothing.

1005
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:16,041
-But it's not as big a deal as you--- Stop!

1006
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:19,416
[distantly] Stop. Stop. Stop.Everything we went through:

1007
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,875
the check-ups, the protocols,

1008
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,666
the application,

1009
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:27,083
just imaginingthe life that we would have, and...

1010
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,708
you never thought to mention

1011
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,333
that you did that with her, too.

1012
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:37,208
Yeah, I'm sorry. I should've told you.

1013
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:40,250
This can't just be another thingfor you to be good at, Aaryan.

1014
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:42,083
You need to want this

1015
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,083
with me.

1016
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:46,958
-I guess I was scared.-Of what?

1017
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:50,916
That you'd think I wasn't good enoughto raise a child with.

1018
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:58,208
That if you knew Serena felt I wasn'tgood enough, you'd feel the same.

1019
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:59,958
What are you talking about?

1020
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:03,416
I love you.

1021
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:05,833
I want to have a child with you.

1022
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,791
I thought that was obvious.

1023
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,166
I'm sorry.

1024
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,666
Me, too.

1025
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:19,333
This is really fucking hard.

1026
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:23,375
[distantly] It's just two more dayswith her. Then she's gone.

1027
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:30,250
[wind howls]

1028
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,791
[unsettling, discordant voices vocalising]

[Virginia mutters indistinctly]

[vocalising fades]

1033
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,750
[Aaryan] Virginia?

1034
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,375
I think you're having a bad dream, okay?

1035
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,833
I think you need to go back to bed.

1036
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:42,916
[Virginia breathes shakily]

1037
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,916
Yeah. [panting]

1038
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:51,250
No, Virginia. Your own bed. Not here.

1039
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:53,625
That's okay. It's okay.Just let her sleep here.

1040
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,625

[dripping sound and vocalising]

1046
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:53,041
How do you think Aaryan's coping?

1047
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:01,375
I'd say that we're both doing

1048
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,791
very well.

1049
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,958
-[Virginia chuckles]-[dripping and vocalising fades]

[Virginia hums softly]

1052
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:43,833
[Sjøhus] Mia, incoming callfrom State Hospital West.

1053
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:48,375
The doctor said that she had an embolismand lost her speech and sound.

1054
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:50,125
[Aaryan] For good?

1055
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:53,333
They don't know, they're running tests.They just said to get there ASAP.

1056
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,500
Did you tell them you got Assessment?

1057
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,291
What? No.

1058
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:59,500
-Do you think you should?-Why?

1059
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:02,208
I just don't knowif it's okay for you to go.

1060
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:05,541
-She's my sister.-But, Mia, you hardly ever see her.

1061
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:07,250
I'm the only family she has.

1062
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,208
I'm just sayingwe should check with Virginia.

1063
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,500
-[Virginia] Check what?-Jesus!

1064
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:14,125
My sister's in intensive care. So I justneed to make sure that she's okay.

1065
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:16,583
-[Virginia] You have to see her?-Yes.

1066
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:20,208
-Well then you must.-Thank you.

1067
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,000
Will it affect Assessment?

1068
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,166
[Virginia]Assessment will be terminated, yes.

1069
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,000
[sputters] There must be exemptionsfor an emergency.

1070
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:30,375
Parents are exempt from emergencies?

1071
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,125
-Aaryan is here.-I'll be fine.

1072
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:34,291
You're assessed jointly,not as individuals.

1073
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:37,208

Yeah. What about her?

1292
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:16,833
I tried. I couldn't because of the fire.

1293

Do you have any idea how long it takesto build something like that?

1303
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,291
'Cause it doesn't just happen.

1304

1311
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,916
[Virginia] Assessmentis a rigorous process

1312
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:16,083
with a high threshold for success.

1313
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:21,458
You've marked yourselves outas serious and impressive

1316
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:32,291

regret that I must inform you

1318
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:40,250
that your applicationhas not been successful.

1319

[Aaryan] No.

1322

We did everything you asked.

1323
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:05,000
I did everything.

1324
01:27:07,666 --> 01:27:09,000
Everything!

1325
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:15,583
You can't fail me 'cause of that.

1326
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:20,500
You told me I had to do itto pass Assessment!

1327
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:22,375
I never said that.

1328
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:28,750
You fucked her?

1329
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,583
-I did it for us.-You fucked our child.

1330
01:27:35,666 --> 01:27:38,000
-She's not our child.-She is, that's the entire point.

1331
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:40,458
She was not our child when she fucked me!

1332
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:43,916
You said if Assessment was over,you'd let us know.

1333
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,875
Why didn't you fail us at the time?

1334
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:47,750
You can't do this. It's not right.

1335
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:49,791
-Step aside.-Why did you not do that?

1336
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,125
[Aaryan] You can't do this, okay.It's not right.

1337
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:54,375
-[Virginia] Please.-No, it's not right. You can't. It's...

1338
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:57,708
Do you know the things I've donefor this society? The people I know?

1339

Why?

Why did we fail?

1423
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:09,250
-Because you...-[Grace sighs]

1424
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:11,708
...you tricked Aaryan.

1425
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:13,416
Aaryan made a choice.

1426

You trusted him. Children lie, Mia.

1427
01:36:17,166 --> 01:36:20,250

Do you even know how seriousan offense it is you even being here?

1431
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,125
I could have you arrested.

01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:46,041
'Cause I saved your fucking life.

1437
01:36:48,166 --> 01:36:49,333
And...

1438
01:36:50,458 --> 01:36:51,583
We...

1439
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:54,041
connected.

1440
01:36:54,125 --> 01:36:55,500
It's... It's common

1441
01:36:57,208 --> 01:37:01,875
for candidates to feel a bondwith their Assessor, it doesn't mean...

1442
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:06,083
Why are you being like this?What are you afraid of?

1443
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:09,333
That you might actually feel something?

1444
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:12,083
I've had to learn how to not feel.

1445
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:13,958
What I'm...

1446
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:17,833
What I'm trying to do here, Mia,is to help you: You need to leave.

1447
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:20,958
I actually thought there was a personbehind the uniform,

1448
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:24,583
that it couldn't all just be an act,but there isn't, is there?

1449
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:28,166
-You're just a lonely bitter husk.-Yes. I'm a monster. Now go.

1450
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:32,041
It's normal to fuck someone's partner,to nearly die?

1451
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:33,875
That's just what you do?

1452
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:37,625
'Cause I have to sayit sounds a little unprofessional.

1453
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:41,291
Don't you think people ought to knowthat this is what Assessment is?

1454
01:37:41,375 --> 01:37:42,916
Everything that I did

1455
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,958
is within the protocols.

1456
01:37:45,041 --> 01:37:49,750
But you failed for the same reasonthat everyone fails, Mia.

1457
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:52,125
You just weren't good enough.

1458
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:53,500
[Grace sighs]

1459
01:37:54,708 --> 01:37:56,541
What do you mean, everyone fails?

1460
01:37:57,083 --> 01:37:58,625
[Grace scoffs]

1461
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:03,541
What do you mean, everyone fails?

1462
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:07,333
That's... That's a turn of phrase.I didn't mean...

1463
01:38:07,416 --> 01:38:09,500
How many peoplepassed Assessment this year?

1464
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:13,166
-That's confidential information.-What about the last two years?

1465
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:15,291
The last three? The last five? How many?

1466
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:18,041
A hundred? Ten? One? What?Do you think we can't find out?

1467
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:20,708
-That Aaryan and I don't know who to ask?-Six years.

1468
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:25,666
That's the last time anyone passed.

1469
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:33,791
[Mia breathes shakily]

1470
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:45,041
[whispers] So...

1471
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,666
So, we never had a chance.

1472
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:57,833
Then what is the point of any of it?

1473
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,083
Stopping it would be bad for morale.

1474
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:07,958
You could've just failed us.You didn't have to humiliate us.

1475
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:10,791
No, I had to prove

1476
01:39:11,958 --> 01:39:13,458
you weren't good enough.

1477
01:39:17,208 --> 01:39:18,708
What is wrong with you?

1478
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:22,125
How can you even do this?

1479
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:23,625
Most can't.

1480
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:28,333
Assessors usually burn out

1481
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:31,958
within a few months,they find it too intense.

1482
01:39:35,416 --> 01:39:36,833
But if you can do it,

1483
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:39,750
there are rewards.

1484
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:41,625
And what was yours?

1485
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:43,750
A child.

1486
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:49,541
[she laughs softly]

1487
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:54,791
[quietly] They're gonna give me a child.

1488
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:58,875
-Okay.-In the future.

1489
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:02,375
If the numbers drop.

1490
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:06,083
And you think that you would be aheadof people like Aaryan and me?

1491
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:11,375
We've made things for this society.

1492
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:15,000
And what have you done?Just victimised innocent people?

1493
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:18,791
I've done everythingthat they asked of me!

1494
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:22,791
And I've been spat on.

1495
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:27,541
I've been demeaned, I've been debased.

1496
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:32,500
I've sacrificed every single part of methat is left to...

1497
01:40:33,375 --> 01:40:37,500
to help this society to function,and you fucking dare to look down on me.

1498
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:40,875
-There's no list. You must know that.-Of course there's a list.

1499
01:40:40,958 --> 01:40:43,041
-Why would there be?-Because there has to be!

1500
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:51,958
Because this society

1501
01:40:53,083 --> 01:40:55,166
needs people

1502
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:57,958
who know what it is

1503
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:01,500
to love a child.

1504
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:07,291
You have no idea

1505
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:10,583
what it's like...

1506
01:41:13,166 --> 01:41:14,291
to hold...

1507
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:17,500
to hold your child in your arms,

1508
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:23,083
telling her that everything'sgonna be okay,

1509
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:25,791
even though she's dying.

1510
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:31,583
That's when you really know

1511
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:33,958
what love is.

1512
01:41:38,708 --> 01:41:41,375
My daughter is not alive,but she's here, you know?

1513
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:44,083
She's... she's present.

1514
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:48,166
She's a part of mefor every single second.

1515
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:51,458
And you can't...

1516
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:54,666
You can't, you can't possibly know

1517
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:56,750
what that's like.

1518
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,625
Not the way that I do.

1519
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:03,916
[breathes raggedly]

1520
01:42:12,166 --> 01:42:13,583
[soft vocalising]

1521
01:42:30,958 --> 01:42:32,500
[softly] I'm sorry about your daughter.

1522
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:41,083
It's her birthday next week.

1523
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:44,708
She drowned when she was eight.

1524
01:42:46,125 --> 01:42:47,666
[quietly] So stupid.

1525
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,458
[sighs deeply]

1526
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:05,333
Is it true what Holly said, that...

1527
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:08,958
that people are surviving?

1528
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:15,583
It's not much of a life.

1529
01:43:18,875 --> 01:43:20,125
But yes.

1530
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:25,250
Would you go?

1531
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:30,000
[Grace sighs]

1532
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:33,583
I'm old, Mia.

1533
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:38,708
Without the Senoxidine, I won't last long.

1534
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:45,208
And the Old Worldis not a nice place to be.

1535
01:43:47,666 --> 01:43:49,000
And this is?

1536
01:43:50,416 --> 01:43:52,000
[vocalising intensifies]

1537
01:43:57,583 --> 01:43:59,791
[indistinct chatter in background]

1538
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:05,125
[Grace] Your supporting material

1539
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:09,000
places you in the top 0.1 percentileof citizens.

1540
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:11,000
[vocalising fades]

1541
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:14,833
Over the next seven days,you will undergo close observation

1542
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:16,375
and formal testing

1543
01:44:16,458 --> 01:44:18,791
to ascertain suitability for parenting.

1544
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:23,166
In the event of a pass,

1545
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:27,291
your material will be passed onfor ex-utero gestation.

1546
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:32,541
In the event of a fail,candidates will be notified immediately.

1547
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:35,750
Assessor's decision is final.

1548
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:40,208
Is that clear?

1549
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:41,958
I'm sure everyone says this, but...

1550
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:44,625
we'd make really great parents.

1551
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:48,916
[woman] Let me show you the room.

1552
01:44:50,041 --> 01:44:51,750
[low roar of waves]

1553
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,583
It's got everything you asked for.

1554
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,875
Adequate.

1555
01:45:18,708 --> 01:45:21,208
I'll... I'll let you unpack.

1556
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,291
Do you...

1557
01:45:26,083 --> 01:45:27,875
Do you ever keep in touch

1558
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:30,666
with the children

1559
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:32,958
as they grow?

1560
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:35,791
No.

1561
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:37,583
I don't.

1562
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,500
I'll leave you to it.

1563
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:42,708
