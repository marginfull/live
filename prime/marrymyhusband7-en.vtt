You can't mark on money.

00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:56.849 line:80%
She was going to die anyway.

3
00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:59.185 line:80%
-What happens to us?
-Stop talking!

4
00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:08.319 line:80%
Marry...

5
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.155 line:80%
my husband.

6
00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.080 line:80%
Park Min-hwan must marry Jeong Su-min?

7
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:22.708 line:80%
Yes.

8
00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:25.586 line:80%
If I don't,

9
00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.298 line:80%
I'll have to marry Park Min-hwan,

10
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.675 line:80%
get cancer,

11
00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:37.515 line:80%
and get killed by my husband
and best friend.

12
00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:43.020 line:80%
"The inevitable will happen."

13
00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:48.025 line:80%
You didn't know?

14
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.989 line:80%
I didn't. Maybe because
I haven't changed much.

15
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.408 line:80%
Just a few things.

16
00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:02.081 line:80%
For example, sending Baek Eun-ho
to the reunion to clear the air.

17
00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.585 line:80%
So that's why Eun-ho came...

18
00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:12.341 line:80%
But how did you know about Goseuljung?

19
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:19.974 line:80%
Because I went...

20
00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.479 line:80%
to your funeral.

21
00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:35.114 line:80%
My funeral.

22
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.332 line:80%
How was my funeral?

23
00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:53.007 line:80%
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

24
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:55.634 line:80%
It was sad.

25
00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:58.846 line:80%
A lot of people...

26
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.850 line:80%
had regrets.

27
00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:07.271 line:80%
You're lying.

28
00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.149 line:80%
I can just imagine it.

29
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.153 line:80%
No one would be sad

30
00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:16.655 line:80%
or regret anything.

31
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.035 line:80%
"I guess someone died."

32
00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:25.956 line:80%
"Right. I remember her now."

33
00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:28.792 line:80%
"She's gone now."

34
00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:31.545 line:80%
Something like that.

35
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:38.427 line:80%
Shall we talk somewhere else?

36
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.347 line:80%
It might take a while.

37
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.911 line:80%
Is this his house?

38
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:09.667 line:80%
Getting out?

39
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:11.961 line:80%
Oh, yes.

40
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:28.769 line:80%
Let's go in.

41
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:46.870 line:80%
No, don't.

42
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.832 line:80%
-No.
-You can put him down.

43
00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:51.291 line:80%
I love cats.

44
00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.545 line:80%
But he doesn't like people...

45
00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.046 line:80%
Hi.

46
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.840 line:80%
Well, I thought he didn't.

47
00:05:00.092 --> 00:05:02.052 line:80%
You're so cute.

48
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.430 line:80%
Do you want tea?

49
00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:07.349 line:80%
I have everything. Coffee too.

50
00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.059 line:80%
Anything is fine.

51
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.983 line:80%
You know, I'm good with cheese tabby cats.

52
00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:19.069 line:80%
You're so pretty.

53
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.877 line:80%
Can it be avoided?

54
00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:37.254 line:80%
What if you avoid it?

55
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.175 line:80%
If you break up with Park Min-hwan
or cut ties with Jeong Su-min.

56
00:05:43.427 --> 00:05:45.012 line:80%
I tried.

57
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.138 line:80%
But...

58
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:52.311 line:80%
Min-hwan would have a fit
if I tried to break up with him.

59
00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:56.982 line:80%
If he kills me in ten years,
who's to say he wouldn't now?

60
00:05:58.484 --> 00:06:00.069 line:80%
What if you run away?

61
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.780 line:80%
I wanted to.

62
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.742 line:80%
When I came back, everything was scary.

63
00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:10.496 line:80%
I just wanted to forget everything
and run away somewhere.

64
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.040 line:80%
But realistically, it was impossible.

65
00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.335 line:80%
You can pick up and leave

66
00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.213 line:80%
only when you have financial freedom.

67
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.966 line:80%
But you can run away now. I can help you.

68
00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:25.344 line:80%
That's right.

69
00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:27.971 line:80%
But I found out.

70
00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:32.851 line:80%
That I can't evade anything
by running away.

71
00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:40.359 line:80%
You see, I used to have a scar here.

72
00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.487 line:80%
I was burned by a coffee pot.

73
00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:52.204 line:80%
You got hurt instead of me.

74
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.918 line:80%
The shape of this scar is
exactly the same.

75
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.016 line:80%
If I didn't get hurt,

76
00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:16.145 line:80%
eventually...

77
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.441 line:80%
you would've gotten hurt?

78
00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:26.697 line:80%
Yes.

79
00:07:31.243 --> 00:07:33.495 line:80%
Avoiding it is not the answer.

80
00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:38.458 line:80%
Either way, the inevitable will happen.

81
00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:43.213 line:80%
If I don't give my fate to someone else.

82
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.049 line:80%
A wound for a wound,

83
00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:48.302 line:80%
marriage for marriage,

84
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:52.848 line:80%
and a death...

85
00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:54.766 line:80%
For a death.

86
00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:07.821 line:80%
So I'm not going to run away.

87
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:27.633 line:80%
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

88
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:36.034 line:80%
TAXI
VACANT

89
00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:54.803 line:80%
I don't usually come to this area
even if I got a call.

90
00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.180 line:80%
This is amazing.

91
00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:59.057 line:80%
I was about to call it a day,

92
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:00.809 line:80%
but I got this feeling.

93
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.103 line:80%
Thank you.

94
00:10:07.733 --> 00:10:10.027 line:80%
You must've lost something precious.

95
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.323 line:80%
I don't even know if it was or not.

96
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:17.326 line:80%
We barely knew each other.

97
00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:20.078 line:80%
Goodness.

98
00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:22.122 line:80%
Why, though?

99
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.999 line:80%
A man should be daring!

100
00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.877 line:80%
You should've seen it to the end
no matter what.

101
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.004 line:80%
I should have.

102
00:10:31.173 --> 00:10:32.257 line:80%
I'm regretting it.

103
00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.720 line:80%
I think I had a few chances.

104
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.515 line:80%
Why did you miss them?

105
00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.394 line:80%
I didn't know it was my chance.

106
00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:49.733 line:80%
Other times, I thought it was wrong.

107
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.236 line:80%
Honestly, I don't know.

108
00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:57.574 line:80%
I realized my feelings recently.

109
00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.951 line:80%
I was just living.

110
00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:06.416 line:80%
But when I heard that she had died...

111
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.471 line:80%
If you get another chance,
what will you do?

112
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.391 line:80%
There are no more chances.

113
00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:23.558 line:80%
No, if there was.

114
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:26.937 line:80%
Will you take it?

115
00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:32.818 line:80%
Seeing as how you missed
all those chances,

116
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.403 line:80%
maybe you just didn't.

117
00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:37.447 line:80%
Maybe something stopped you.

118
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.201 line:80%
I...

119
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.912 line:80%
So don't regret it.

120
00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:47.791 line:80%
I'm sure there's a reason for your choice.

121
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.835 line:80%
Or...

122
00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:54.714 line:80%
Will you grab your true chance?

123
00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:25.787 line:80%
This might sound stupid,

124
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:29.749 line:80%
but I didn't know how I felt.

125
00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.548 line:80%
If I had, I'd have protected her.

126
00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.514 line:80%
So if I get a chance,

127
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.105 line:80%
I'll take it.

128
00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:01.031 line:80%
By the way, how did you come back?

129
00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.783 line:80%
I thought I had died,

130
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.161 line:80%
but I woke up to 2013.

131
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.215 line:80%
I fell asleep and woke up.

132
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.510 line:80%
Then I was in 2013.

133

Did you hear?
Marketing Team 1 is about to explode.

135
00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.833 line:80%
I hope the meal kit project comes to us.

Hey.

139
00:13:57.587 --> 00:14:02.092 line:80%
I have an interview at seven today,
so I can't pick Yeon-ji up.

140
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.969 line:80%
That's such a lame lie.

141
00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.596 line:80%
What company schedules an interview
at 7:00 p.m.?

142
00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.642 line:80%
What, do you know everything?

143
00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.352 line:80%
I said it, so believe it.

144
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.772 line:80%
Besides, I heard your project has tanked.

145
00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.651 line:80%
Daddy.

146
00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:20.986 line:80%
What?

147
00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.697 line:80%
You didn't take her to daycare?

148
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.700 line:80%
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

149
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:31.496 line:80%
What?

150
00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.379 line:80%
...will you join me?

151
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.214 line:80%
Shall I take you out instead?

152
00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:42.841 line:80%
If it weren't for me,

153
00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:46.928 line:80%
who would get promoted for this?
You or Kang Ji-won?

154
00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:54.853 line:80%
Why is my life like this?

155

U&K HRD INSTITUTE JEJU

MOST BEAUTIFUL

158
00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.283 line:80%
What?

159
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.104 line:80%
Isn't he the head of Strategic Planning?

160
00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.731 line:80%
-If he's here, there will be blood.
-For sure.

161
00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.316 line:80%
What's going on?

162

General Manager Yu Ji-hyuk.

163
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.746 line:80%
I heard about you.

164
00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.052 line:80%
You transfer to HR now?

165
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.848 line:80%
I'm just a salary man. I do what I'm told.

166
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.934 line:80%
This isn't for the sake of the company--

167
00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.477 line:80%
At U&K, the chairman...

168
00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.397 line:80%
can do whatever he wants.

169
00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:05.608 line:80%
Whether it's for the company
or his family.

170
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:10.947 line:80%
Did you

171
00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:14.325 line:80%
really think he'd do nothing?

172
00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.997 line:80%
I didn't think he'd send you.

KANG JI-WON

174

I didn't know she was your type.

175
00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:30.175 line:80%
I just meant it was unexpected.

176
00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.843 line:80%
More humble than expected.

177
00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.763 line:80%
She's not

178
00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:36.723 line:80%
humble.

179
00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:38.683 line:80%
Maybe.

180
00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:40.602 line:80%
A seven-year relationship.

181
00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:44.022 line:80%
But she started something with you.

182
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.273 line:80%
It's not--

183
00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:48.234 line:80%
You left work together,
and you went to your house.

184
00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:49.819 line:80%
Was that overtime?

185
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.863 line:80%
Are you tailing me?

186
00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.448 line:80%
Only when it's needed.

187
00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.200 line:80%
You would to.

188
00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:59.329 line:80%
You didn't have to up until now,
but you're capable of anything.

189
00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.873 line:80%
You might want to soon.

190
00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:09.172 line:80%
Were you going to give the project to her?

191
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:14.135 line:80%
If so, it seems you decided that
after a very improper night.

192
00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.600 line:80%
General Manager Yu Ji-hyuk.

193
00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:23.269 line:80%
HR will investigate this properly.

194
00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.314 line:80%
It won't be swayed by public opinion.

195
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.984 line:80%
Objectively and without
a woman's influence.

196
00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:35.323 line:80%
Until then, it seems inappropriate
that Ms. Kang leads this project.

197
00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:38.952 line:80%
Considering the circumstances,
she's directly involved too.

198
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.954 line:80%
Until the results are clear,

199
00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:49.087 line:80%
you should leave it to Ms. Yang.

204
00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:20.827 line:80%
you'll decide that Kang Ji-won
is best for this project.

205
00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.582 line:80%
I'm saying nothing happened last night.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:35.800 line:80%
From now on,

207
00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:38.219 line:80%
the meal kit project will resume.

The leader...

209
00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:49.063 line:80%
will be Ms. Yang.

210
00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:55.111 line:80%
Kang Ji-won, Park Min-hwan,
and Jeong Su-min will assist.

211
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.197 line:80%
That'll be all.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.632 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

Discuss the schedule with Ms. Yang.

214
00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.181 line:80%
You said Mr. Park and Su-min must marry.

215
00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:25.725 line:80%
Won't this be more comfortable?

216
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.978 line:80%
But it means
three assistant managers are on it.

217
00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:35.777 line:80%
You know what I can do.

218
00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:51.250 line:80%
I knew it, but still, Ms. Yang.

219
00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.543 line:80%
Congratulations.

220
00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:54.337 line:80%
But am I just lucky?

221
00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:56.965 line:80%
I wasn't supposed to join this.

222
00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.634 line:80%
It's because the meal kit team is
the dream team.

223
00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:01.010 line:80%
It's our main project.

224
00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:05.306 line:80%
Maybe they formed the team this way
to keep it until next year.

225
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.393 line:80%
It makes no sense.
Three assistant managers on it?

226
00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:12.897 line:80%
Will I be asked to leave?

227
00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:15.024 line:80%
That jerk... I mean...

228
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.403 line:80%
Is Mr. Yu sick or something?

229
00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.990 line:80%
Thought it isn't like him,

230
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.118 line:80%
I'm sure he has a reason.

231
00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.663 line:80%
Well, let's work hard.

232
00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:36.879 line:80%
Good luck.

233
00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:40.049 line:80%
Take this chance to get ahead of Hui-yeon.

234
00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.176 line:80%
Thank you.

235
00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.057 line:80%
This is good.

236
00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.436 line:80%
How did you know I like strawberry milk?

237
00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.604 line:80%
I just bought it because I like it.

238
00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:55.231 line:80%
I got it right.

239
00:21:56.774 --> 00:22:00.069 line:80%
Oh, right.
I think we're going to a workshop.

240
00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:01.779 line:80%
A workshop?

241
00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:05.158 line:80%
I've never been to one.

242
00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.118 line:80%
We normally go twice a year.

243
00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:11.873 line:80%
But Mr. Yu is too individualistic.
He's so selfish.

244
00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.291 line:80%
I see...

245
00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:16.127 line:80%
This is delicious.

246
00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:21.966 line:80%
No, that's okay.

247
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.094 line:80%
I'll grill meat for you deliciously
at the workshop.

248
00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:27.764 line:80%
And buy more milk.

249
00:22:58.628 --> 00:23:00.838 line:80%
Whenever my dad gave me an allowance,

250
00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:03.216 line:80%
he always drew a heart on it.

251
00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.343 line:80%
Will you grab your true chance?

252
00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.930 line:80%
The inevitable will happen.

253
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.431 line:80%
And a death...

254
00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:12.725 line:80%
For a death.

255
00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:38.459 line:80%
I started to work here today.

256
00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:40.753 line:80%
I'll be scared if you're here for me.

257
00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:44.799 line:80%
And if it's a coincidence,
it'll feel like fate.

258
00:23:49.512 --> 00:23:50.888 line:80%
Do you know "Dynamite"?

259
00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:02.233 line:80%
You mean Nobel's invention?

260
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.863 line:80%
And "Spring Day"?

261
00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:15.955 line:80%
I know spring is from March to May.

262
00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:18.666 line:80%
Though I don't know
if I need to know more.

263
00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:24.005 line:80%
You get to live
a smooth, long, happy life.

264
00:24:24.922 --> 00:24:26.048 line:80%
Congratulations.

265
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.514 line:80%
I mean, I think
you have a lot of time left.

266
00:24:43.274 --> 00:24:44.275 line:80%
Chef?

267
00:24:45.193 --> 00:24:46.360 line:80%
I'm going home.

268
00:24:46.444 --> 00:24:48.738 line:80%
-Great job today.
-Thank you.

269
00:24:58.247 --> 00:24:59.248 line:80%
Ji-hyuk!

270
00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:04.295 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

271
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:08.466 line:80%
Mr. Yu, you can't do this here.
Yu Ji-hyuk!

272
00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:13.512 line:80%
Hello!

273
00:25:13.596 --> 00:25:15.431 line:80%
Oh, right.

274
00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:16.933 line:80%
Hello.

275
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:20.353 line:80%
I pressed the call button,
and the call was made to you.

276
00:25:20.436 --> 00:25:21.687 line:80%
Right.

277
00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:25.191 line:80%
I called him like crazy.
I guess my number was at the top.

278
00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:28.819 line:80%
This is my crazy brother and boss.

279
00:25:28.903 --> 00:25:32.740 line:80%
He left me out of the team,
then I couldn't reach him all day.

280
00:25:33.658 --> 00:25:36.160 line:80%
But I don't know why he's wasted here.

281
00:25:36.244 --> 00:25:37.328 line:80%
This is a first.

282
00:25:38.663 --> 00:25:40.331 line:80%
Maybe it's puberty...

283
00:25:41.332 --> 00:25:42.833 line:80%
Or a quarter-life crisis?

284
00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:48.881 line:80%
Who's the person
that sent such a great cake?

285
00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:51.550 line:80%
This is love itself!

286
00:25:51.634 --> 00:25:53.719 line:80%
-What?
-It means it's good.

287
00:25:54.512 --> 00:25:55.554 line:80%
Really?

288
00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:58.099 line:80%
Get up, man in crisis.

289
00:25:58.182 --> 00:25:59.308 line:80%
By any chance,

290
00:26:00.017 --> 00:26:01.978 line:80%
do you know Kang Ji-won?

291
00:26:02.687 --> 00:26:03.688 line:80%
What?

292
00:26:07.024 --> 00:26:08.276 line:80%
Oh, Werther!

293
00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:10.653 line:80%
The Basque cheesecake that was made

294
00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:15.157 line:80%
with the fresh milk from a mountain goat
in New Zealand that just gave birth

295
00:26:19.954 --> 00:26:21.038 line:80%
Unbelievable.

296
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.086 line:80%
I really enjoyed it.

297
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:28.170 line:80%
Thanks.

298
00:26:41.726 --> 00:26:43.394 line:80%
You know what I can do.

GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

300
00:27:10.713 --> 00:27:12.923 line:80%
The person you are calling...

301
00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:49.835 line:80%
Hangover soup?

302
00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:52.004 line:80%
You came home on Hui-yeon's back.

303
00:27:52.088 --> 00:27:54.840 line:80%
Now you're drinking on an empty stomach.

304
00:28:01.931 --> 00:28:02.932 line:80%
Thank you.

305
00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:04.934 line:80%
Chairman Yu's asking for you.

306
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.993 line:80%
You must've drank something nice.

307
00:28:23.494 --> 00:28:25.913 line:80%
I'm sure you gargled, but you still reek.

308
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.499 line:80%
There's nothing cheap here.

309
00:28:33.295 --> 00:28:36.799 line:80%
Yu-ra took care
of Director Wang's incident very well.

310
00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:38.175 line:80%
She's good.

311
00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:40.219 line:80%
OH YU-RA
VICE PRESIDENT OF CLOUD AIR

312
00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:42.888 line:80%
I heard you had an argument with Mr. Lee.

313
00:28:44.014 --> 00:28:44.849 line:80%
That's not true.

314
00:28:44.932 --> 00:28:47.685 line:80%
Yes, it is. Though he denied it too.

315
00:28:48.686 --> 00:28:52.523 line:80%
It seems you have other eyes and ears
at the company.

316
00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:58.904 line:80%
I'm sure you'll cut off
my eyes and ears eventually,

317
00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:00.781 line:80%
but not Mr. Lee.

318
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.451 line:80%
Make him your person at all cost.

319
00:29:03.534 --> 00:29:05.327 line:80%
He's worth it.

320
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.000 line:80%
Goodness.

321
00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:13.669 line:80%
I spoke with Oh Gang-cheol.

322
00:29:14.253 --> 00:29:15.713 line:80%
You take care of Yu-ra.

323
00:29:16.714 --> 00:29:20.468 line:80%
Gang-cheol can't complain
after everything I've done for him.

324
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.889 line:80%
I thought you wanted me to marry Yu-ra.

325
00:29:24.972 --> 00:29:27.600 line:80%
What if that's what I want?

326
00:29:31.562 --> 00:29:33.397 line:80%
Look at yourself.

327
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.568 line:80%
You even skipped puberty,
but now you clash with my person.

328
00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:40.529 line:80%
And you get carried home.

329
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:42.823 line:80%
Now you're drinking in the morning.

330
00:29:45.743 --> 00:29:46.744 line:80%
But still,

331
00:29:47.495 --> 00:29:51.290 line:80%
I can't force you to do something
just because of what I want.

332
00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:57.588 line:80%
I know that you two
never wanted this marriage.

333
00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.632 line:80%
But it's a promise.

334
00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:02.134 line:80%
It's not right to call it off.

335
00:30:02.218 --> 00:30:03.552 line:80%
From our side at that.

336
00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:09.808 line:80%
So try your best to look sincere

337
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:11.769 line:80%
and take care of it.

338
00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.569 line:80%
When can I see that girl?

339
00:30:23.614 --> 00:30:26.534 line:80%
Why won't you answer me?
You caused this mess.

340
00:30:29.203 --> 00:30:32.540 line:80%
I don't think you can.

341
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.293 line:80%
I feel the same as you.

342
00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:40.172 line:80%
You want me to be happy,

343
00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:43.676 line:80%
and I want the same for her.

344
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.704 line:80%
My time already ended then.

345
00:31:20.087 --> 00:31:21.130 line:80%
But at least...

346
00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:24.883 line:80%
I can protect her this time.

347
00:31:26.427 --> 00:31:27.678 line:80%
THE LATE KANG JI-WON

348
00:31:31.765 --> 00:31:33.017 line:80%
I won't run away.

349
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.271 line:80%
I won't regret not doing anything.

350
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:43.986 line:80%
Even if I'm not in her happiness...

351
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:04.089 line:80%
Roijental! I wish I'd bought it.

352
00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:07.760 line:80%
I should have when it seemed too late.

353
00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:10.012 line:80%
Did you see Roijental?

354
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:13.974 line:80%
I should've bought it.
I thought about it for six months!

355
00:32:14.058 --> 00:32:16.602 line:80%
Don't look at that. I sold it months ago.

356
00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:19.146 line:80%
I want to kill myself for it now.

357
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.398 line:80%
Did you hear?

358
00:32:21.482 --> 00:32:24.068 line:80%
That's the stock I sold for you.

359
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:25.235 line:80%
Do you even know?

360
00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:30.699 line:80%
I'm only with you
because I still have TKU.

361
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.623 line:80%
ROIJENTAL

362
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.796 line:80%
EARNINGS RATE
701%

363
00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:48.801 line:80%
Ji-won, come out for a bit.

364
00:33:02.064 --> 00:33:03.524 line:80%
What was she looking at?

365
00:33:09.405 --> 00:33:10.864 line:80%
ROIJENTAL

366
00:33:10.948 --> 00:33:15.828 line:80%
So Ji-won had this stock
without Min-hwan knowing?

367
00:33:16.495 --> 00:33:19.581 line:80%
She pretends to be busy all the time.
That sly fox.

368
00:33:22.626 --> 00:33:25.045 line:80%
Why hasn't she sold it, though?

369
00:33:27.131 --> 00:33:29.258 line:80%
Does she think it'll increase more?

370
00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:36.098 line:80%
PURCHASE

371
00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:40.018 line:80%
Remember the restaurant I went with Su-min
with your credit card?

372
00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:41.228 line:80%
It was good.

373
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:43.439 line:80%
I kept thinking about you.

374
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:46.316 line:80%
I wanted to take you too.

375
00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:48.068 line:80%
And that's today.

376
00:33:51.155 --> 00:33:53.657 line:80%
Did you think about me?

377
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.076 line:80%
I always

378
00:33:57.661 --> 00:33:59.413 line:80%
think about you.

379
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:03.000 line:80%
Are you free tonight?

380
00:34:05.294 --> 00:34:06.128 line:80%
By the way,

381
00:34:07.796 --> 00:34:08.839 line:80%
you got money?

382
00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:11.633 line:80%
Yeah, that's right!

383
00:34:11.717 --> 00:34:15.763 line:80%
The money I gave you
after I sold the hot Roijental stocks.

384
00:34:15.846 --> 00:34:17.556 line:80%
Let's use that.

385
00:34:19.808 --> 00:34:22.895 line:80%
Before we marry, I need to make something
happen with Su-min.

386
00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:26.356 line:80%
And I think I'll have to spend some money.

387
00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.817 line:80%
How could I not have known this?

388
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:33.572 line:80%
He talked about going to fancy places,
but it was just a trick to get something.

389
00:34:34.531 --> 00:34:36.784 line:80%
I'm such a dummy!

390
00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:40.996 line:80%
Why? Dummy?
Did you do something with that money?

391
00:34:41.538 --> 00:34:46.126 line:80%
I didn't tell you,
but I spent it all to take out insurance.

392
00:34:46.627 --> 00:34:47.586 line:80%
What?

393
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:52.007 line:80%
But I can't even get half of it
if I cancel it now.

394
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:56.720 line:80%
But it'll increase by ten percent
in ten years.

395
00:34:56.804 --> 00:34:58.931 line:80%
Hey, you dummy! Are you stupid?

396
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:00.182 line:80%
Are you possessed?

397
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.976 line:80%
It's all a scam!
It benefits insurance companies.

398
00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:06.730 line:80%
I thought you were smart. You're so dumb!

399
00:35:06.814 --> 00:35:08.774 line:80%
Damn it! I can't believe this!

400
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:14.363 line:80%
Should I sell TKU?

401
00:35:17.282 --> 00:35:19.827 line:80%
Ruling and opposing lawmakers
involved in the TKU...

402
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.996 line:80%
But I think it'll go up. This is nuts!

403
00:35:23.997 --> 00:35:25.749 line:80%
Still, I earned a lot.

404
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:28.085 line:80%
This is driving me crazy!

405
00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:30.170 line:80%
How much do you need?

406
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:34.508 line:80%
I have a savings plan that matures soon.

407
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:38.303 line:80%
What savings?

408
00:35:39.513 --> 00:35:43.559 line:80%
You sold Roijental for me.
I'd feel so bad if you sold TKU too.

409
00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:44.852 line:80%
Right.

410
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:49.857 line:80%
Don't sell it. I'll lend you the money.

411
00:35:52.276 --> 00:35:53.110 line:80%
Babe.

412
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.739 line:80%
Also, instead of eating out tonight,

413
00:35:57.823 --> 00:36:00.701 line:80%
let's go somewhere this weekend
with Su-min.

414
00:36:06.707 --> 00:36:10.085 line:80%
Look at the sky! It's so nice! So pretty!

415
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.795 line:80%
I wish I had sunglasses!

416
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.509 line:80%
The weather said it'd be cloudy.

417
00:36:17.593 --> 00:36:19.595 line:80%
I knew it'd be okay with you here.

418
00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:21.930 line:80%
Since you're a weather fairy.

419
00:36:22.014 --> 00:36:24.683 line:80%
You sure know me so well.

420
00:36:26.268 --> 00:36:29.479 line:80%
Ji-won, stop working so hard.

421
00:36:29.563 --> 00:36:31.315 line:80%
You got rid of your bosses.

422
00:36:31.398 --> 00:36:32.691 line:80%
You want to be CEO?

423
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:35.986 line:80%
Everyone at work praises you,

424
00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:38.614 line:80%
but that's not charming to men.

425
00:36:39.281 --> 00:36:40.324 line:80%
You dummy!

426
00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:44.119 line:80%
Min-hwan, don't say things like that.
You'll get in trouble.

427
00:36:46.663 --> 00:36:49.333 line:80%
Su-min, why don't you have some cold beer?

428
00:36:56.465 --> 00:36:57.466 line:80%
You want one too?

429
00:36:58.926 --> 00:37:00.093 line:80%
I want snacks too!

430
00:37:00.177 --> 00:37:01.178 line:80%
Snacks!

431
00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:15.359 line:80%
When I think about it,
you're both precious to me.

432
00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:20.072 line:80%
I met Su-min in middle school,
and we're still close.

433
00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:21.990 line:80%
And Min-hwan...

434
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.328 line:80%
We met at work
and have been together ever since.

435
00:37:28.622 --> 00:37:32.042 line:80%
Our relationship is incredible.

436
00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:34.753 line:80%
Right?

437
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:41.176 line:80%
We're a family.

438
00:37:42.636 --> 00:37:45.764 line:80%
Maybe I'll take her out for some air
and push her off somewhere.

439
00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:49.685 line:80%
You and me...

440
00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:52.062 line:80%
And Min-hwan.

441
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:55.565 line:80%
Let's be happy.

442
00:37:59.987 --> 00:38:02.948 line:80%
I'll have to do a good job.

443
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.702 line:80%
To keep two princesses happy, right?

444
00:38:09.705 --> 00:38:11.957 line:80%
Ji-won, well? How does it feel...

445
00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:14.501 line:80%
to have me?

446
00:38:19.548 --> 00:38:20.590 line:80%
Damn it!

447
00:38:22.968 --> 00:38:24.886 line:80%
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

448
00:38:26.138 --> 00:38:27.014 line:80%
What?

449
00:38:30.267 --> 00:38:32.269 line:80%
No, it was a bug.

450
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:34.187 line:80%
What? A bug? Where?

451
00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:35.522 line:80%
-I'm scared!
-Come here.

452
00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:37.274 line:80%
-Where's the bug?
-Where's it?

453
00:38:37.357 --> 00:38:38.442 line:80%
Bugs scare me!

454
00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:42.029 line:80%
I'll chase it away! I'll do it.
Don't come near here!

455
00:38:42.571 --> 00:38:44.531 line:80%
-Min-hwan!
-Are you okay?

456
00:38:44.614 --> 00:38:45.741 line:80%
A bug! Bug!

457
00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:47.993 line:80%
I'll get it for you!

458
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.786 line:80%
Are you okay?

459
00:38:51.747 --> 00:38:53.999 line:80%
It reminds me of when we were a thing.

460
00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:57.794 line:80%
You looked so cool
chasing the bug away for me.

461
00:38:58.587 --> 00:38:59.838 line:80%
Did I do that?

462
00:39:02.049 --> 00:39:02.883 line:80%
When?

463
00:39:06.428 --> 00:39:08.388 line:80%
Su-min's scared of bugs too.

464
00:39:08.472 --> 00:39:10.307 line:80%
I'm glad you're here.

465
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.349 line:80%
Right.

466
00:39:20.567 --> 00:39:23.278 line:80%
After riding this, let's go on a trip.

467
00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:25.822 line:80%
How's that?

468
00:39:25.906 --> 00:39:27.407 line:80%
Shall you go alone?

469
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:28.492 line:80%
Go over there!

470
00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:30.035 line:80%
There you go! That's it.

471
00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:40.295 line:80%
Yes, Ms. Yang?

472
00:39:41.755 --> 00:39:42.589 line:80%
What?

473
00:39:43.507 --> 00:39:44.549 line:80%
I'm on my way.

474
00:39:46.218 --> 00:39:47.302 line:80%
What?

475
00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:48.553 line:80%
Work again?

476
00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:55.268 line:80%
Goodness. She's such a workaholic.

477
00:39:55.352 --> 00:39:57.312 line:80%
She's working on the weekend?

478
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.315 line:80%
I only have her.

479
00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:03.777 line:80%
But she's too busy to hang out with me.

480
00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.612 line:80%
I can't see her often either.

481
00:40:05.695 --> 00:40:08.323 line:80%
She thinks it's her project. Jeez.

482
00:40:12.077 --> 00:40:14.830 line:80%
Su-min, do you know how to ride a bike?

483
00:40:14.913 --> 00:40:17.082 line:80%
I've never ridden one before.

484
00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:18.667 line:80%
I'm scared of it.

485
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.418 line:80%
It's not scary!

486
00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:22.045 line:80%
I'll teach you. Let's go.

487
00:40:22.129 --> 00:40:23.713 line:80%
-Really?
-It's not scary.

488
00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:26.258 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won.

489
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:27.634 line:80%
Sorry about that.

490
00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:29.845 line:80%
I wanted to leave here,

491
00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:31.304 line:80%
and you just called...

492
00:40:31.388 --> 00:40:32.806 line:80%
-Did I startle you?
-What?

493
00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:34.349 line:80%
No.

494
00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:36.977 line:80%
So you're not coming?

495
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.520 line:80%
I'm waiting for you.

496
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:40.021 line:80%
What?

497
00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:41.857 line:80%
Where are you?

498
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.258 line:80%
Here.

499
00:41:11.303 --> 00:41:12.846 line:80%
Wow, thanks.

500
00:41:15.724 --> 00:41:18.143 line:80%
But shouldn't I be giving you flowers?

501
00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:20.061 line:80%
I heard you work near here now.

502
00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:22.522 line:80%
Yeah, it's really close.

503
00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:26.484 line:80%
So make sure to come by.

504
00:41:32.282 --> 00:41:34.242 line:80%
There's a dinner reservation today.

505
00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:36.536 line:80%
-So I should go.
-What?

506
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:38.997 line:80%
Yeah, okay.

507
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.526 line:80%
I have something to tell you.

508
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.487 line:80%
That's good. So do I.

509
00:42:11.154 --> 00:42:12.155 line:80%
Take a seat.

510
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.662 line:80%
Why did you come to work?

511
00:42:19.246 --> 00:42:22.540 line:80%
I wanted to get Min-hwan and Su-min
on a date today.

512
00:42:22.624 --> 00:42:25.252 line:80%
So we came out together,
and I ditched them.

513
00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:31.925 line:80%
I missed two things
during my succession process in 2021.

514
00:42:32.801 --> 00:42:35.553 line:80%
One is the Cloud Air and Kelite Tour.

515
00:42:36.137 --> 00:42:37.681 line:80%
I remember.

516
00:42:38.515 --> 00:42:41.810 line:80%
They were affiliates of U&K
but became independent.

517
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:44.646 line:80%
And the other is...

518
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:46.898 line:80%
Mr. Lee Seok-jun.

519
00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:51.820 line:80%
My grandfather wanted him
to stay by my side,

520
00:42:52.404 --> 00:42:55.448 line:80%
but he resigned
when I became the chairman.

521
00:42:56.992 --> 00:42:58.451 line:80%
Why did he do that?

522
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.122 line:80%
Either way, he's uncomfortable.

523
00:43:02.205 --> 00:43:03.665 line:80%
He can't be controlled.

524
00:43:05.709 --> 00:43:09.296 line:80%
It's why I couldn't make you
the leader of the project.

525
00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:15.010 line:80%
I'll help with everything.

526
00:43:16.386 --> 00:43:17.887 line:80%
Whatever you need.

527
00:43:19.514 --> 00:43:20.473 line:80%
Everything.

528
00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:39.743 line:80%
You always arrived early
when you worked at the far branch.

529
00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:42.078 line:80%
But now you live close to work, but...

530
00:43:42.662 --> 00:43:44.164 line:80%
I wasn't late.

531
00:43:44.247 --> 00:43:46.041 line:80%
You arrived three minutes ago.

532
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:47.959 line:80%
If you start acting out...

533
00:43:48.043 --> 00:43:49.336 line:80%
I wasn't late.

534
00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:51.046 line:80%
Okay.

535
00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:54.341 line:80%
As long as you're on time.

536
00:43:54.424 --> 00:43:55.508 line:80%
Anyway,

537
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:57.886 line:80%
that man came again.

538
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:13.276 line:80%
I'm seeing you often.

539
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.070 line:80%
I want to get to know you.

540
00:44:16.196 --> 00:44:18.031 line:80%
To see if you're a player.

541
00:44:18.114 --> 00:44:20.408 line:80%
If you have qualities to be solid land.

542
00:44:24.954 --> 00:44:27.624 line:80%
I hope you drink in moderation today.

543
00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:30.001 line:80%
To see how desperate you are.

544
00:44:30.794 --> 00:44:32.921 line:80%
Why would you do that?

545
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:36.591 line:80%
I think it's why I came.

546
00:44:38.468 --> 00:44:40.095 line:80%
Stop the food show.

547
00:44:40.845 --> 00:44:44.557 line:80%
No need to attract women.
You're skilled enough to make money.

548
00:44:46.935 --> 00:44:48.395 line:80%
What do you care?

549
00:44:54.442 --> 00:44:55.777 line:80%
I won't drink anymore.

550
00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:58.196 line:80%
There's something I must do.

551
00:45:09.958 --> 00:45:13.545 line:80%
There will be a marketing workshop
to improve teamwork.

552
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:15.964 line:80%
Be careful not to get hurt, and...

553
00:45:21.845 --> 00:45:22.846 line:80%
That'll be all.

554
00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:39.195 line:80%
Ms. Yang.

555
00:45:42.157 --> 00:45:45.410 line:80%
How about we get Hui-yeon to prepare
the workshop?

556
00:45:46.453 --> 00:45:47.287 line:80%
Sounds good.

557
00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:48.621 line:80%
Hui-yeon.

558
00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:53.001 line:80%
Do you want to prepare the workshop?

559
00:45:54.043 --> 00:45:55.044 line:80%
Me?

560
00:45:56.671 --> 00:45:57.922 line:80%
Prepare it myself?

561
00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:06.639 line:80%
U&K FOOD AUTUMN WORKSHOP

562
00:46:06.723 --> 00:46:09.684 line:80%
WE ARE ONE! MARKETING TEAM!

563
00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:35.793 line:80%
It'll suck if we get this sleeping bag.

564
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.089 line:80%
Why decide on accommodations
by a treasure hunt?

565
00:46:40.924 --> 00:46:43.218 line:80%
I can't sleep in a place like this.

566
00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:45.386 line:80%
Just work hard in the game!

567
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.139 line:80%
It's more fun than just drinking!

568
00:46:48.848 --> 00:46:52.268 line:80%
Also, when else
would we do something like this?

569
00:46:57.774 --> 00:46:58.900 line:80%
Put it over there.

570
00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:04.572 line:80%
I was nervous when I heard Hui-yeon
will be the one planning the workshop.

571
00:47:04.656 --> 00:47:08.076 line:80%
We have to play the name tag game too!
This is crazy.

572
00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:09.536 line:80%
Still, I'm glad.

573
00:47:09.619 --> 00:47:12.789 line:80%
Her sense of loss from the project
must be gone.

574
00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:17.085 line:80%
Yes. And we're always sitting.
It's nice doing something new.

575
00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:19.295 line:80%
Don't get ahead of yourself.

576
00:47:19.379 --> 00:47:21.005 line:80%
You suck at treasure hunts.

577
00:47:21.673 --> 00:47:23.341 line:80%
We'll see.

578
00:47:23.424 --> 00:47:24.634 line:80%
I'll try hard.

579
00:47:25.134 --> 00:47:27.178 line:80%
You can't do this after you die.

580
00:47:27.762 --> 00:47:28.846 line:80%
Die?

581
00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:35.186 line:80%
I mean,

582
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.398 line:80%
everyone dies one day, right?

583
00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:41.025 line:80%
Women should just sit back for this.

584
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:43.236 line:80%
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

585
00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:44.654 line:80%
Do you trust me?

586
00:47:44.737 --> 00:47:46.614 line:80%
I'll find the number one flag,

587
00:47:46.698 --> 00:47:48.366 line:80%
and then find the rest for you all.

588
00:47:51.828 --> 00:47:52.829 line:80%
Number one...

589
00:47:53.997 --> 00:47:54.998 line:80%
Let's do this.

590
00:47:56.416 --> 00:47:57.417 line:80%
PARK MIN-HWAN

591
00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.294 line:80%
Hey, wait!

592
00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:08.219 line:80%
I screwed up.

593
00:48:08.303 --> 00:48:11.347 line:80%
If I remember correctly,
Min-hwan gets number five.

594
00:48:11.431 --> 00:48:13.266 line:80%
He sleeps in a sleeping bag.

595
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:15.602 line:80%
I found number four and hid.

596
00:48:15.685 --> 00:48:17.186 line:80%
I ended up in a tent.

597
00:48:20.148 --> 00:48:21.149 line:80%
Jeong Su-min...

598
00:48:28.948 --> 00:48:30.199 line:80%
Here, Su-min.

599
00:48:30.867 --> 00:48:32.118 line:80%
Anything else?

600
00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:33.328 line:80%
Let's take a photo.

601
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:34.746 line:80%
Sounds good.

602
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:42.962 line:80%
Strangely,
Su-min always got the best things.

603
00:48:43.713 --> 00:48:45.131 line:80%
Hide!

604
00:48:47.133 --> 00:48:51.095 line:80%
Don't you think
we hid number one too well?

605
00:48:51.179 --> 00:48:52.972 line:80%
Well, I'm the one who hid it.

606
00:48:53.056 --> 00:48:55.058 line:80%
Which means it can be found!

607
00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:57.769 line:80%
But you're completely wild.

608
00:48:57.852 --> 00:48:59.395 line:80%
Who'd go in the water?

609
00:48:59.479 --> 00:49:02.440 line:80%
Yeah, the water's so cold...

610
00:49:02.523 --> 00:49:03.733 line:80%
Water?

611
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.526 line:80%
That's hard.

612
00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:08.988 line:80%
Mr. Kim would help if he was here.

613
00:49:09.989 --> 00:49:11.783 line:80%
Where's Min-hwan? Can he swim?

614
00:49:12.617 --> 00:49:14.619 line:80%
Why? Will you ask him to find it?

615
00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:18.956 line:80%
Of course! It must be
the stream up there. It's dangerous.

616
00:49:19.707 --> 00:49:22.377 line:80%
Just ask for help.
Don't take the hard way.

617
00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:30.468 line:80%
Why? Because he's your boyfriend?

618
00:49:32.178 --> 00:49:33.596 line:80%
No, it's not that.

619
00:49:34.263 --> 00:49:35.973 line:80%
Then can I borrow him?

620
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:44.065 line:80%
Ji-won, you need to do anything you can
to get what you want.

621
00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:47.026 line:80%
For me,
that's what it means to truly want it.

622
00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:58.496 line:80%
Was that how she got
everything she wanted?

623
00:50:04.043 --> 00:50:09.382 line:80%
Jeong Su-min sure
got everything she wanted in 2023.

624
00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:23.479 line:80%
I like you a lot.

625
00:50:23.563 --> 00:50:24.814 line:80%
I'll help with everything.

626
00:50:24.897 --> 00:50:27.900 line:80%
Just ask for help.
Don't take the hard way.

627
00:50:30.445 --> 00:50:32.363 line:80%
Did you find number one?

628
00:50:32.447 --> 00:50:36.033 line:80%
-I'd find it for you if I knew--
-Hui-yeon hid it in the stream.

629
00:50:37.243 --> 00:50:38.369 line:80%
Can you help me?

630
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.788 line:80%
-Of course.
-No.

631
00:50:41.289 --> 00:50:42.874 line:80%
Not that. Something else.

632
00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:55.553 line:80%
Can I just be honest with you?

633
00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:03.561 line:80%
Then don't think of me as someone strange,

634
00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:06.063 line:80%
don't hate me, and just listen to me.

635
00:51:09.192 --> 00:51:10.777 line:80%
Be that person for me.

636
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:19.368 line:80%
I know you're willing to do everything
to help me.

637
00:51:22.622 --> 00:51:24.415 line:80%
But I want to do it on my own.

638
00:51:26.918 --> 00:51:31.756 line:80%
Until the media announced
that you would be the successor to U&K,

639
00:51:32.423 --> 00:51:35.092 line:80%
you always did the right thing.

640
00:51:35.968 --> 00:51:37.512 line:80%
I don't want you to do

641
00:51:40.515 --> 00:51:43.643 line:80%
something you wouldn't because of me.

642
00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:46.813 line:80%
I...

643
00:51:46.896 --> 00:51:49.440 line:80%
You said I was a competent person.

644
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:53.110 line:80%
I can really do anything.

645
00:51:57.114 --> 00:51:58.115 line:80%
So...

646
00:52:00.368 --> 00:52:02.620 line:80%
just let me be honest with you

647
00:52:02.703 --> 00:52:04.330 line:80%
from time to time.

648
00:52:06.707 --> 00:52:09.502 line:80%
We're the only two people living

649
00:52:10.753 --> 00:52:12.129 line:80%
these moments again.

650
00:52:12.964 --> 00:52:14.882 line:80%
Things I can't say to others.

651
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.802 line:80%
Let me confide in you.

652
00:52:32.692 --> 00:52:34.235 line:80%
Didn't you say your dad

653
00:52:35.236 --> 00:52:37.113 line:80%
drew a heart on your allowance?

654
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:56.215 line:80%
Why is that...

655
00:53:04.265 --> 00:53:05.558 line:80%
Your dad's allowance.

656
00:53:10.313 --> 00:53:11.772 line:80%
I should listen to you.

657
00:53:11.856 --> 00:53:13.316 line:80%
I'll do everything you want.

658
00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:26.454 line:80%
So you can use me all you want.

659
00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:30.333 line:80%
It's okay.

660
00:53:45.014 --> 00:53:47.266 line:80%
I don't have to spend it, right?

661
00:53:50.519 --> 00:53:52.396 line:80%
I just want to talk with it.

662
00:53:55.066 --> 00:53:56.192 line:80%
And...

663
00:53:58.903 --> 00:54:01.447 line:80%
I want my allowance to be happy.

664
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:08.162 line:80%
Is there anything you want to do
in your second life?

665
00:54:10.915 --> 00:54:12.708 line:80%
-Ji-won...
-Mr. Yu.

666
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:14.627 line:80%
Is there something you want?

667
00:54:20.132 --> 00:54:21.133 line:80%
I want...

668
00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:25.846 line:80%
to be happy.

669
00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:31.435 line:80%
On my own.

670
00:54:32.812 --> 00:54:33.896 line:80%
With my strength.

671
00:54:35.564 --> 00:54:37.525 line:80%
I am going to be happy.

672
00:55:10.266 --> 00:55:12.810 line:80%
Did he spend all of his time working out?

673
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.313 line:80%
This isn't good enough.

674
00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:18.691 line:80%
My back!

675
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.820 line:80%
If it wasn't for my disc problems,
they'd all be dead.

676
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.780 line:80%
My L4 and L5.

677
00:55:28.409 --> 00:55:29.577 line:80%
What?

678
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.829 line:80%
Su-min, are you okay?

679
00:55:31.912 --> 00:55:32.913 line:80%
What's going on?

680
00:55:32.997 --> 00:55:36.876 line:80%
I got caught on a branch.

681
00:55:37.752 --> 00:55:38.878 line:80%
Let me see.

682
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:42.798 line:80%
Oh, no. This is bad.

683
00:55:42.882 --> 00:55:44.341 line:80%
That hurts.

684
00:55:57.188 --> 00:55:59.732 line:80%
You should apply ointment.

685
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:01.192 line:80%
Let's go to base camp.

686
00:56:01.275 --> 00:56:03.069 line:80%
It's okay. I put saliva on it.

687
00:56:04.987 --> 00:56:09.408 line:80%
By the way, can you help me
with something?

688
00:56:10.785 --> 00:56:11.702 line:80%
With what?

689
00:56:12.578 --> 00:56:15.456 line:80%
I know where the stick for number one is.

690
00:56:16.248 --> 00:56:17.583 line:80%
But it's in the water.

691
00:56:18.084 --> 00:56:22.046 line:80%
What if I go in the water
and this gets worse?

692
00:56:22.755 --> 00:56:24.423 line:80%
Right. Okay.

693
00:56:29.929 --> 00:56:31.889 line:80%
KANG JI-WON

694
00:56:45.861 --> 00:56:47.446 line:80%
That's far.

695
00:57:01.877 --> 00:57:04.130 line:80%
Ms. Yang, I just asked the master.

696
00:57:04.213 --> 00:57:07.842 line:80%
He said the water's deep and to not go in.
There's moss too.

697
00:57:08.884 --> 00:57:10.761 line:80%
Let's get over there.

698
00:57:10.845 --> 00:57:13.556 line:80%
Wait, let's call the safety officer first.

699
00:57:40.124 --> 00:57:41.125 line:80%
Are you insane?

700
00:57:42.084 --> 00:57:43.711 line:80%
You're not even prepared.

701
00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:45.379 line:80%
The water could be deep!

702
00:57:48.424 --> 00:57:50.384 line:80%
Mr. Yu, I'm fine.

703
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:51.844 line:80%
Nothing is fine!

704
00:57:53.512 --> 00:57:54.972 line:80%
You could just tell me.

705
00:57:55.055 --> 00:57:57.016 line:80%
Why is that so hard?

706
00:57:57.725 --> 00:58:00.227 line:80%
Just ask for help! Why take the hard path?

707
00:58:03.564 --> 00:58:05.191 line:80%
I'm not Su-min.

708
00:58:07.568 --> 00:58:10.154 line:80%
Because she's wrong and I'm right.

709
00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:14.366 line:80%
I won't live like her.

710
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:18.037 line:80%
I'm going to get everything on my own!

711
00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:23.209 line:80%
That's the right thing to do.

712
00:58:23.292 --> 00:58:25.377 line:80%
That's what Kang Ji-won would do!

713
00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:27.504 line:80%
Because that's me.

714
00:58:58.994 --> 00:58:59.995 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

715
00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:06.877 line:80%
Is there something you want?

716
00:59:10.923 --> 00:59:12.258 line:80%
I want...

717
00:59:13.759 --> 00:59:15.219 line:80%
Have you been on a boat?

718
00:59:15.886 --> 00:59:18.847 line:80%
After my dad died,

719
00:59:19.682 --> 00:59:22.643 line:80%
it feels like I'm on a boat every day.

720
00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:26.438 line:80%
My feet are firmly planted,

721
00:59:26.522 --> 00:59:28.232 line:80%
but the boat keeps rocking.

722
00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:30.651 line:80%
I feel anxious.

723
00:59:33.946 --> 00:59:35.948 line:80%
I want stability.

724
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.870 line:80%
I want to step on solid land.

725
00:59:59.471 --> 01:00:01.015 line:80%
I want to be solid land.

726
01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:34.757 line:80%
I won't let them marry.

727
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.383 line:80%
It's all over now.

728
01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:38.385 line:80%
Focus on one thing today.

729
01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:39.928 line:80%
Kang Ji-won won.

730
01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:41.430 line:80%
If we had more time,

731
01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:43.849 line:80%
I would've fallen for you completely.

732
01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.851 line:80%
But this fate puts the brake down.

733
01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.311 line:80%
You can't get a cent?

734
01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.646 line:80%
I even took out a private loan.

735
01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:54.902 line:80%
But at this rate, I don't think
he'll give up marrying you.

736
01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:55.944 line:80%
Shall we get married?

737
01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:59.990 line:80%
What a crappy way to say you'll sponge off
me for life. You call that family?

738
01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:07.873 line:80%
