00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.097 line:83%
I do hope that Mr. Wick

4
00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:02.974 line:83%
finds his way to safety.

5
00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.143 line:83%
He knew the rules, he broke them.

6
00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.604 line:83%
And killed a man on company grounds, Charon.

7
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.731 line:83%
Do you expect him to make it out?

8
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.566 line:83%
$14 million bounty on his head.

9
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:15.194 line:83%
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

10
00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.780 line:83%
I'd say the odds are about even.

11
00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:38.176 line:83%
You think the hospital's there to help, man?

12
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.344 line:83%
No way!

13
00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:42.639 line:83%
They'll kill you just as soon as
they'll make you better!

14
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.682 line:83%
But I know better, man.

15
00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:46.517 line:83%
I know better. I know what I'm...

16
00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.944 line:83%
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

17
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.487 line:83%
Tick tock.

18
00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.697 line:83%
Tick tock.

19
00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:02.992 line:83%
Tick tock. Tick...

20
00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:05.161 line:83%

Change of plan.

24

Can you see that he's received by the concierge?

26
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.668 line:83%
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

27
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.214 line:83%

"Consider your origins.

35
00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.788 line:83%

Looking a little run down there, John.

Ernest. I still have time.

40
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.305 line:83%
It's almost up. Who's gonna know the difference?

41
00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:13.432 line:83%
You sure this is what you wanna do?

42
00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:15.309 line:83%
Fourteen million. It's a lot of money.

43
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:16.352 line:83%
Not if you can't spend it.

44
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.849 line:83%
Oh, shit.

45
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.361 line:83%
Push it back.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:42.957 line:83%
Mr. Wick.

52
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.543 line:83%
No, no. You shouldn't be here. Hour's almost up.

53
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.295 line:83%
I know, Doc, please. There's still time.

54
00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:48.921 line:83%
No! I can't.

55
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.381 line:83%
I still have five minutes!

56
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.050 line:83%
Please.

57
00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:00.975 line:83%
Come on. Come on.

58
00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:08.858 line:83%
All right, sit there.

59
00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:15.656 line:83%
All right, let me see. Let me see.

60
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.658 line:83%
Uh-huh.

61
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.537 line:83%
Puncture wound.

62
00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:24.582 line:83%
Went deep. Nicked the artery.

63
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.419 line:83%
Here you go.

64
00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:30.588 line:83%

Doc?

69
00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:00.076 line:83%
Yeah. We're halfway there.

70
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.497 line:83%
- Five seconds.
- Yeah.

One.

75
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.228 line:83%
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

76
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:28.771 line:83%
I know. Rules.

77
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.606 line:83%
Ah, rules.

78
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.656 line:83%
John Wick, 14 million.

00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:16.068 line:83%
And away we go.

82
00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:43.220 line:83%
Top shelf. On the right.

83
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.473 line:83%
Yeah. Take four.

84
00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:48.309 line:83%
It will give you energy. Help with the pain.

85
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.361 line:83%
Mr. Wick?

86
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.282 line:83%
They'll never believe I stopped on the hour.

87
00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:04.825 line:83%
But you did.

88
00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:06.452 line:83%
They'll know.

89
00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.745 line:83%
Know what?

90
00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:10.122 line:83%
I told you where the medicine was.

91
00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:28.682 line:83%
- Where?
- Here.

92
00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:29.850 line:83%
Just below my floating rib.

93
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.352 line:83%
Be sure not to hit my large intestine.

94
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.689 line:83%
Oh, wait!

95
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.566 line:83%
One may not be enough.

96
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.572 line:83%
Yeah. All right.

97
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.408 line:83%
Be sure not to graze my...

98
00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:48.577 line:83%
Oh!

99
00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.419 line:83%
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

100
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.757 line:83%
Thanks, Doc.

101
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:42.129 line:83%
John Wick. Open contract.

102
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.673 line:83%
Increase, 15 million.

103
00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:49.386 line:83%
Where are you going, Jonathan?

104
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.063 line:83%
We are closed.

105
00:25:57.138 --> 00:26:01.559 line:83%
Jardani. Why have you come home?

106
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.609 line:83%
You present this to me like an answer.

107
00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:11.987 line:83%
I still have my ticket.

108
00:26:13.446 --> 00:26:16.491 line:83%
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

109
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:18.994 line:83%
you think your ticket is valid?

110
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.162 line:83%
You forget that the Ruska Roma

111
00:26:21.162 --> 00:26:23.081 line:83%
is bound by the High Table,

112
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:26.334 line:83%
and the High Table stands above all?

113
00:26:26.334 --> 00:26:28.545 line:83%
They could kill me just for talking to you.

114
00:26:30.213 --> 00:26:35.176 line:83%
You honor me by bringing death to my front door.

115
00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:41.224 line:83%
Oh, Jardani, what has become of you?

116
00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:01.494 line:83%
You are bound...

117
00:27:01.494 --> 00:27:04.039 line:83%
And I am owed.

118
00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:10.170 line:83%
Rooney, enough!

119
00:27:41.534 --> 00:27:44.537 line:83%
"You are owed." You are owed nothing, Jardani.

120
00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:46.748 line:83%
You know, when my pupils first come here,

121
00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:48.541 line:83%
they wish for one thing.

122
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:51.086 line:83%
A life free of suffering.

123
00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:53.713 line:83%
I try to dissuade them from these childish notions,

124
00:27:53.713 --> 00:27:55.965 line:83%
but as you know,

125
00:27:56.716 --> 00:27:58.259 line:83%
art is pain.

126
00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:03.640 line:83%
Life is suffering.

127
00:28:08.561 --> 00:28:11.064 line:83%
Somehow, you managed to get out.

128
00:28:12.148 --> 00:28:14.317 line:83%
But here you are, back where you began.

129
00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:17.487 line:83%
All of this, for what?

130
00:28:54.357 --> 00:28:55.608 line:83%
Pirouette.

131
00:28:57.318 --> 00:28:59.779 line:83%
Pirouette, pirouette.

132
00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.658 line:83%
Sit.

133
00:29:17.338 --> 00:29:22.177 line:83%
Even if I wanted to, I can't help you, Jardani.

134
00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:25.388 line:83%
The High Table wants your life.

135
00:29:26.222 --> 00:29:29.142 line:83%
How can you fight the wind?

136
00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:30.685 line:83%
How can you smash the mountains?

137
00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:33.354 line:83%
How can you bury the ocean?

138
00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:36.107 line:83%
How can you escape from the light?

139
00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:38.651 line:83%
Of course, you can go to the dark.

140
00:29:38.693 --> 00:29:40.695 line:83%
But they're in the dark, too.

141
00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:48.328 line:83%
So tell me, Jardani. What do you really want?

142
00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:52.248 line:83%
Passage.

143
00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.084 line:83%
Where did you want to go?

144
00:29:56.753 --> 00:29:58.630 line:83%
Casablanca.

145
00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:03.635 line:83%
The path to paradise begins in hell.

146
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.558 line:83%
So be it.

147
00:30:10.558 --> 00:30:14.395 line:83%
You hand me your ticket, I will tear it.

148
00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:17.649 line:83%
If that's what you really desire.

149
00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.608 line:83%
With this, Jardani, your ticket is torn.

150
00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:12.370 line:83%
You can never come home again.

151
00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:15.915 line:83%
Take him to the lifeboat.

152
00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:18.751 line:83%
Goodbye.

153
00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.590 line:83%
Goodbye.

154
00:31:54.495 --> 00:31:57.582 line:83%
Welcome to the Continental. How may I help you?

155
00:32:15.892 --> 00:32:20.688 line:83%
Sir. There is an Adjudicator here to see you.

156
00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:23.608 line:83%
Very well, sir.

157
00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:28.821 line:83%
The manager is in the lounge.

158
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.580 line:83%
I presume you're here to discuss John Wick.

159
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.999 line:83%
If that's so, we can make this short.

160
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:43.670 line:83%
I told him to walk away, he declined to do so.

161
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.213 line:83%
And that's the all of it.

162
00:32:46.005 --> 00:32:47.548 line:83%
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

163
00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:49.842 line:83%
Oh, yes.

164
00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:51.969 line:83%
And I haven't got the slightest idea where he is...

165
00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:53.346 line:83%
You're mistaken.

166
00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:55.014 line:83%
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

167
00:32:55.014 --> 00:32:57.684 line:83%
I'm here because Mr. Wick
broke the rules in this hotel.

168
00:32:57.725 --> 00:32:59.018 line:83%
- Hmm.
- The blood was spilt

169
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.521 line:83%
on the grounds of the Continental. Was it not?

170
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:02.689 line:83%
Oh, yes.

171
00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:04.941 line:83%
As a matter of fact, the body gets colder

172
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:06.859 line:83%
within these very walls.

173
00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:09.278 line:83%
I'd like to see it.

174
00:33:36.973 --> 00:33:39.892 line:83%
Santino D'Antonio.

175
00:33:39.934 --> 00:33:42.061 line:83%
A newly instated member of the High Table,

176
00:33:42.061 --> 00:33:42.979 line:83%
slain by Mr. Wick

177
00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:46.274 line:83%
while seeking sanctuary in the Continental.

178
00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:53.990 line:83%
With a .45 ACP, it appears.

179
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.909 line:83%
I had no control over Mr. Wick's actions.

180
00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:59.787 line:83%
And yet, he lives because you deemed it so, yes?

181
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:01.622 line:83%
Yes.

182
00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:04.000 line:83%
You have known Mr. Wick for a great many years.

183
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.294 line:83%
It might even be fair to call you friends, yes?

184
00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:09.672 line:83%
Instead of stopping him, instead of killing him,

185
00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:11.591 line:83%
you stood by and let him walk away

186
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:14.010 line:83%
after he shot Santino D'Antonio in front of you.

187
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.053 line:83%
I made him Excommunicado.

188
00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:19.015 line:83%
But not before you gave him an hour to escape.

189
00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:20.725 line:83%
He broke the rules in my hotel.

190
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:23.394 line:83%
This is exactly the problem, your hotel.

191
00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:25.772 line:83%
Where is your fealty?

192
00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:27.940 line:83%
I've been of service for over 40 years.

193
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.109 line:83%
Under the Table. Serving the Table.

194
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:31.944 line:83%
Everything is under the Table.

195
00:34:31.944 --> 00:34:33.654 line:83%
I understand that you have your loyalties,

196
00:34:33.654 --> 00:34:34.989 line:83%
but this cannot be overlooked.

197
00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:38.659 line:83%
Let me be clear. I am here to adjudge you.

198
00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.495 line:83%
You have one week to get your affairs in order.

199
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:42.997 line:83%
Excuse me?

200
00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:45.833 line:83%
At such time, your successor will be named.

201
00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:49.170 line:83%
There are rules,

202
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.922 line:83%
they are the only things that separate us...

203
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.466 line:83%
- From the animals.
- Yes.

204
00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:55.134 line:83%
You have seven days.

205
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.141 line:83%
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

206
00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:05.019 line:83%
you may look for me in room 217.

207
00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:08.064 line:83%
Enjoy your stay at the Continental.

208
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.746 line:83%
There's an Adjudicator here to see you.

209
00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:41.013 line:83%
Welcome to my Mission Control.

210
00:35:41.013 --> 00:35:44.517 line:83%
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

211
00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:46.811 line:83%
From whence I control the word on the street,

212
00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:48.020 line:83%
the way of the world.

213
00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.522 line:83%
With pigeons.

214
00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:53.526 line:83%
Yes. You see rats with wings, but I see the Internet.

215
00:35:54.777 --> 00:35:58.698 line:83%
No IP addresses. No digital footprint.

216
00:35:58.698 --> 00:36:02.535 line:83%
Can't track it, can't hack it, can't trace it.

217
00:36:02.535 --> 00:36:05.121 line:83%
Can you get disease from it?

218
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:07.623 line:83%
Well, I wouldn't recommend that you eat one.

219
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.710 line:83%
What the hell do you want?

220
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.670 line:83%
I wanted to see where it didn't happen.

221
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.255 line:83%
Where what didn't happen?

222
00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:16.048 line:83%
Where you didn't kill John Wick.

223
00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:18.217 line:83%
I've always been under the impression

224
00:36:18.217 --> 00:36:21.637 line:83%
that contracts and executing them was optional.

225
00:36:21.637 --> 00:36:23.639 line:83%
I have no problem with John Wick.

226
00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:33.524 line:83%
And yet, you gave John a seven-round Kimber 1911,

227
00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:35.067 line:83%
knowing that he intended to use it

228
00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:36.944 line:83%
to stand against the Table. Yes?

229
00:36:41.282 --> 00:36:44.076 line:83%
This Kimber 1911, to be exact.

230
00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.252 line:83%
You gave John Wick seven bullets,

231
00:36:53.252 --> 00:36:56.088 line:83%
the High Table is giving you seven days.

232
00:36:56.088 --> 00:36:58.591 line:83%
Seven days for what, exactly?

233
00:36:58.591 --> 00:36:59.842 line:83%
To settle your affairs

234
00:36:59.842 --> 00:37:02.178 line:83%
and find a new home for your birds.

235
00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:04.764 line:83%
In seven days, you abdicate your throne.

236
00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:18.194 line:83%
Oh, my dear.

237
00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:21.113 line:83%
Tell me, do you know what the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

238
00:37:21.113 --> 00:37:23.783 line:83%
Do you know what happens when I wave my hand?

239
00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:27.161 line:83%
No, there will be no replacement for me on the throne.

240
00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:29.830 line:83%
Because I am the throne, baby.

241
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.999 line:83%
I am the Bowery!

242
00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.586 line:83%
I am all that you deign not to look at

243
00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.963 line:83%
when you walk down the street at night.

244
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:40.841 line:83%
The Bowery is mine. Mine alone.

245
00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:43.678 line:83%
Do not make the mistake of thinking

246
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:47.056 line:83%
you exist outside the rules, no men do.

247
00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:48.891 line:83%
You have seven days.

248
00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.284 line:83%
Enough!

249
00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:38.876 line:83%
I'm afraid our friend here is off limits.

250
00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:41.837 line:83%
But he's Excommunicado.

251
00:39:41.837 --> 00:39:44.381 line:83%
It seems the manager has granted him amnesty.

252
00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:47.301 line:83%
Mr. Jonathan,

253
00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:50.137 line:83%
would you be so kind as to come with me?

254
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:13.410 line:83%
Welcome to Casablanca, Mr. Wick.

255
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.413 line:83%
Thanks.

256
00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:21.460 line:83%
Mr. Jonathan,

257
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.379 line:83%
it has been a long time since our fine city

258
00:40:23.379 --> 00:40:25.172 line:83%
has been graced with your presence.

259
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.091 line:83%
I need to talk to...

260
00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.301 line:83%
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar, she's expecting you.

261
00:40:36.308 --> 00:40:40.146 line:83%
My, my, welcome to the Moroccan Continental.

262
00:40:40.146 --> 00:40:42.022 line:83%
I hope you'll find it to your taste.

263
00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:45.234 line:83%
Right this way.

264
00:40:45.234 --> 00:40:48.112 line:83%
Ms. Al-Azwar, she waits for no man.

265
00:40:52.032 --> 00:40:56.912 line:83%
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan. Best of luck.

266
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:33.365 line:83%
You a dog person, John?

267
00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:35.409 line:83%
Sofia?

268
00:41:40.206 --> 00:41:42.875 line:83%
Sofia!

269
00:41:42.875 --> 00:41:45.252 line:83%
You can't kill the bearer of your marker.

270
00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:48.339 line:83%
I didn't kill you. I just shot you.

271
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.507 line:83%
Nice suit.

272
00:41:53.135 --> 00:41:54.887 line:83%
Good to see you, too.

273
00:41:54.887 --> 00:41:57.264 line:83%
I should shoot you in the head right now.

274
00:41:57.264 --> 00:41:58.807 line:83%
I know.

275
00:42:04.063 --> 00:42:06.023 line:83%
Don't you do it.

276
00:42:07.274 --> 00:42:09.944 line:83%
You're Excommunicado, John.

277
00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:14.448 line:83%
And that marker doesn't mean shit.

278
00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:21.538 line:83%
This is your blood.

279
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:24.917 line:83%
Your bond.

280
00:42:24.917 --> 00:42:29.463 line:83%
When you needed help, I was there.

281
00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:38.514 line:83%
Sit.

282
00:42:42.476 --> 00:42:45.020 line:83%
I was talking to you, John.

283
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.113 line:83%
You do realize that I'm management now, right?

284
00:42:54.113 --> 00:42:56.073 line:83%
I'm not service anymore, John.

285
00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:59.618 line:83%
So I don't go around shooting people in the head.

286
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.288 line:83%
I'm not asking you to kill anyone.

287
00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:04.623 line:83%
I just need you to get me to him.

288
00:43:04.623 --> 00:43:07.334 line:83%
- To who?
- Your old boss.

289
00:43:09.336 --> 00:43:10.963 line:83%
You want to kill Berrada.

290
00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:12.965 line:83%
I'm not gonna kill him. I just need to talk.

291
00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:15.426 line:83%
What could he possibly give to you?

292
00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:19.513 line:83%
Guidance.

293
00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:24.393 line:83%
Look, I made a deal when I agreed to run this hotel.

294
00:43:24.393 --> 00:43:25.644 line:83%
And that deal said

295
00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:28.522 line:83%
that I had to follow the rules of the Table.

296
00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:31.984 line:83%
If you're not gonna kill him, he is gonna kill you,

297
00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:35.487 line:83%
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

298
00:43:35.487 --> 00:43:39.241 line:83%
If I make one mistake, one enemy...

299
00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:44.121 line:83%
Maybe somebody goes looking for my daughter.

300
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:48.500 line:83%
And I know what you did, John, to get her out.

301
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:54.131 line:83%
But that's not a chance I can take. Sorry.

302
00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:58.427 line:83%
Do you wanna know where she is?

303
00:43:59.345 --> 00:44:02.431 line:83%
No. I don't ever wanna know.

304
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:05.351 line:83%
Because I don't trust that I won't go find her.

305
00:44:06.602 --> 00:44:10.689 line:83%
A part of me longs for her.

306
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:14.735 line:83%
And I have to kill that part of myself every day,

307
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:16.403 line:83%
just to keep her safe.

308
00:44:19.656 --> 00:44:26.705 line:83%
Because sometimes you have to kill what you love.

309
00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:29.541 line:83%
That's why I gave you that marker in the first place.

310
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:31.418 line:83%
That's why I'm sitting here right now

311
00:44:31.418 --> 00:44:33.629 line:83%
and that's why I'm fucked!

312
00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:41.387 line:83%
- Consequences.
- Yeah.

313
00:44:43.263 --> 00:44:45.140 line:83%
Consequences.

314
00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:49.311 line:83%
I'm just asking you to try.

315
00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:52.106 line:83%
Either way, you and me,

316
00:44:52.606 --> 00:44:54.233 line:83%
we'll be even.

317
00:45:05.285 --> 00:45:06.537 line:83%
No.

318
00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:13.377 line:83%
After this, we are less than even.

319
00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:19.299 line:83%
We leave in 10 minutes.

320
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:17.483 line:83%
How can I help you?

321
00:46:29.828 --> 00:46:32.331 line:83%
I wasn't expecting the High Table so soon.

322
00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:36.668 line:83%
There is a task.

323
00:46:36.668 --> 00:46:38.837 line:83%
It involves someone who broke the rules

324
00:46:38.837 --> 00:46:40.214 line:83%
and stood against the Table.

325
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.384 line:83%
John Wick, you mean.

326
00:46:44.384 --> 00:46:46.345 line:83%
My students have not been idle.

327
00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:49.598 line:83%
John Wick and all who've helped him.

328
00:46:49.598 --> 00:46:51.683 line:83%
You've heard the stories about him, of course.

329
00:46:51.683 --> 00:46:54.436 line:83%
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

330
00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:56.772 line:83%
A dog, a car.

331
00:46:57.731 --> 00:46:58.857 line:83%
I'm familiar.

332
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:03.862 line:83%
And I'm interested.

333
00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:06.448 line:83%
Very.

334
00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:15.874 line:83%
Blow-fish. Very fatal.

335
00:47:20.712 --> 00:47:21.838 line:83%
No soy.

336
00:47:30.556 --> 00:47:34.226 line:83%
I have served, I will be of service.

337
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:16.912 line:83%
Stop!

338
00:49:23.543 --> 00:49:24.628 line:83%
Out!

339
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:34.680 line:83%
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

340
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.724 line:83%
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

341
00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:38.684 line:83%
He had a ticket.

342
00:49:38.684 --> 00:49:41.520 line:83%
But a ticket does not stand above the Table.

343
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:44.439 line:83%
Your penance will be paid in blood.

344
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.941 line:83%
Now...

345
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:53.407 line:83%
Hold out your helping hands and pledge your fealty.

346
00:50:01.581 --> 00:50:06.878 line:83%
I have served, I will be of service.

347
00:50:29.776 --> 00:50:31.778 line:83%
We're not going in like the old days.

348
00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:35.115 line:83%
It's just a conversation.

349
00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:38.994 line:83%
Nothing's ever just a conversation with you, John.

350
00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:44.416 line:83%
Let's go.

351
00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:10.400 line:83%
Sofia.

352
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.028 line:83%
Always so nice to see you.

353
00:51:13.028 --> 00:51:16.823 line:83%
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous. May I pet one?

354
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:18.950 line:83%
Certainly.

355
00:51:22.996 --> 00:51:24.873 line:83%
Fantastic.

356
00:51:25.665 --> 00:51:28.460 line:83%
Jonathan Wick.

357
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.505 line:83%
I had heard you had made your way to our shores.

358
00:51:37.177 --> 00:51:38.970 line:83%
Come along now.

359
00:51:39.012 --> 00:51:40.972 line:83%
I am certain we have much to discuss.

360
00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:50.023 line:83%
I must admit,
I am curious. What brings you to my domain?

361
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.859 line:83%
Tell me.

362
00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:54.820 line:83%
Do you come here to kill me?

363
00:51:57.072 --> 00:51:58.365 line:83%
No.

364
00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:11.753 line:83%
Mr. Wick, do you know where
the word "assassin" comes from?

365
00:52:13.505 --> 00:52:16.800 line:83%
People argue. "Assassin."

366
00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:21.930 line:83%
Hashasheen, followers of Hassan-i...

367
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:26.017 line:83%
Eaters of hashish.

368
00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:28.895 line:83%
No, thank you.

369
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.817 line:83%
But others contend it comes from asasiyyun.

370
00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:36.486 line:83%
Meaning, "men who are faithful

371
00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.071 line:83%
"and who abide by their beliefs."

372
00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:42.576 line:83%
You see that coin?

373
00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:46.037 line:83%
The first coin ever minted in this facility.

374
00:52:46.037 --> 00:52:49.541 line:83%
Next to it, the first marker.

375
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:52.043 line:83%
Not easy to track down, believe me.

376
00:52:52.043 --> 00:52:53.545 line:83%
Now, this coin, of course,

377
00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:56.715 line:83%
it does not represent monetary value.

378
00:52:56.756 --> 00:52:59.885 line:83%
It represents the commerce of relationships,

379
00:52:59.885 --> 00:53:03.138 line:83%
a social contract in which you agree to partake.

380
00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:06.016 line:83%
Order and rules.

381
00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.977 line:83%
You have broken the rules.

382
00:53:08.977 --> 00:53:12.147 line:83%
The High Table has marked you for death.

383
00:53:12.147 --> 00:53:14.190 line:83%
Why would I allow you to leave here alive,

384
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:18.153 line:83%
when your life has been by your own actions, forfeit?

385
00:53:23.283 --> 00:53:25.160 line:83%
I seek to make amends.

386
00:53:26.077 --> 00:53:28.580 line:83%
To pay for what I've done.

387
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.083 line:83%
I seek a meeting with the one
who sits above the Table.

388
00:53:36.671 --> 00:53:40.592 line:83%
This dog, I do so love it.

389
00:53:40.592 --> 00:53:43.511 line:83%
Tell me, does it shed a great deal?

390
00:53:46.139 --> 00:53:48.266 line:83%
Occasionally.

391
00:53:48.266 --> 00:53:51.728 line:83%
When I leave, you can tell the Elder I'm coming.

392
00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.063 line:83%
And if he wants me dead...

393
00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:56.650 line:83%
Then he will see to it that
your bones bleach under the sun.

394
00:53:57.651 --> 00:53:59.277 line:83%
I see.

395
00:53:59.277 --> 00:54:01.613 line:83%
And I would have provided him with a choice.

396
00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:10.121 line:83%
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

397
00:54:11.831 --> 00:54:14.000 line:83%
I cannot tell you where to find the Elder.

398
00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:18.922 line:83%
You fail to understand.

399
00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:20.966 line:83%
The Elder is not a man you find.

400
00:54:20.966 --> 00:54:23.301 line:83%
He can only choose to find you.

401
00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:25.303 line:83%
You wish to speak with him?

402
00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:28.848 line:83%
Go to the edge of the desert, look up.

403
00:54:28.848 --> 00:54:30.308 line:83%
Canis Minor,

404
00:54:30.308 --> 00:54:33.812 line:83%
the dog that followed Orion through the sky.

405
00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:35.855 line:83%
You follow the brightest star.

406
00:54:35.855 --> 00:54:38.316 line:83%
Walk until you are almost dead.

407
00:54:38.316 --> 00:54:41.069 line:83%
Then, keep walking.

408
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:43.154 line:83%
When you are on your last breath,

409
00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:47.117 line:83%
he will find you... Or he will not.

410
00:54:49.035 --> 00:54:50.662 line:83%
I am grateful.

411
00:54:53.164 --> 00:54:54.666 line:83%
Thank you, sir.

412
00:54:57.085 --> 00:54:59.963 line:83%
Perhaps you were not listening before.

413
00:55:03.216 --> 00:55:05.176 line:83%
The social contract.

414
00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.054 line:83%
The commerce of relationships.

415
00:55:09.389 --> 00:55:11.725 line:83%
You have received a great gift.

416
00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:12.976 line:83%
I have hosted your friend.

417
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.937 line:83%
What do you offer in return?

418
00:55:20.233 --> 00:55:22.902 line:83%
So soft and yet so fierce.

419
00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:25.989 line:83%
I love it, this dog.

420
00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:28.867 line:83%
I will keep it.

421
00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:30.076 line:83%
Excuse me?

422
00:55:30.076 --> 00:55:31.911 line:83%
This will be my gift.

423
00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:34.414 line:83%
This will be how you show me your fealty.

424
00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:35.874 line:83%
No.

425
00:55:35.874 --> 00:55:38.084 line:83%
Surely it's the least you can do.

426
00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:40.086 line:83%
No, you cannot keep my dog.

427
00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:42.714 line:83%
Very well.

428
00:55:43.798 --> 00:55:45.133 line:83%
Very well.

429
00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:49.012 line:83%
Then I will kill it.

430
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.061 line:83%
I'm sorry, Sofia.

431
00:55:56.102 --> 00:55:58.229 line:83%
This was for you to learn.

432
00:56:06.905 --> 00:56:07.989 line:83%
Don't.

433
00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.866 line:83%
Sofia. Don't.

434
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.748 line:83%
He shot my dog.

435
00:56:59.999 --> 00:57:01.417 line:83%
I get it.

436
00:57:03.461 --> 00:57:05.922 line:83%
We gotta go. Now.

437
01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:43.069 line:83%
Here you go.

438
01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:50.368 line:83%
You're gonna die, John.

439
01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:53.454 line:83%
Whether out here in this desert,

440
01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:56.165 line:83%
or somewhere else down the road.

441
01:03:57.708 --> 01:03:59.544 line:83%
But you are gonna die.

442
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:16.602 line:83%
Consequences.

443
01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.108 line:83%
Consequences.

444
01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:50.469 line:83%
Better get going.

445
01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.230 line:83%
Sofia.

446
01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:43.976 line:83%
Okay.

447
01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.941 line:83%
You made your point.

448
01:07:52.526 --> 01:07:54.403 line:83%
You have earned my fealty.

449
01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:56.739 line:83%
Matter of fact...

450
01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.616 line:83%
I'm gonna shove so much fealty up your ass

451
01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:00.493 line:83%
it's gonna come spilling out of your mouth.

452
01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:02.661 line:83%
You had your chance.

453
01:08:02.661 --> 01:08:05.706 line:83%
Well, since you see it that way,

454
01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:07.833 line:83%
I guess it's time I told you

455
01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:11.837 line:83%
to climb down off your
High Table and go fuck yourself.

456
01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:13.839 line:83%
Duly noted.

457
01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:15.633 line:83%
You gave John Wick seven bullets,

458
01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:19.512 line:83%
your penance will be paid with seven cuts.

459
01:08:19.512 --> 01:08:22.014 line:83%
Well, sometimes you gotta cut a motherfucker.

460
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:28.145 line:83%
Avert your eyes, my sweet.

461
01:08:29.021 --> 01:08:31.982 line:83%
The king is dead.

462
01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.864 line:83%
Long live the king.

463
01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:33.919 line:83%
Drink.

464
01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:39.717 line:83%
Don't worry, your weapon is still there. Please drink.

465
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.148 line:83%
My son, how have you come to be so lost?

466
01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:55.608 line:83%
Not lost.

467
01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.152 line:83%
Looking for you.

468
01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:00.738 line:83%
You think I speak of your location?

469
01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:04.158 line:83%
Never seen a man fight so hard

470
01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:06.160 line:83%
to end up back where he started.

471
01:10:13.959 --> 01:10:16.003 line:83%
So tell me, Jonathan.

472
01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.963 line:83%
Why do you wish to live?

473
01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:21.967 line:83%
My wife, Helen.

474
01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:29.558 line:83%
To remember her. To remember us.

475
01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:32.144 line:83%
So you seek to live for the memory of love?

476
01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:36.106 line:83%
At least a chance to earn it.

477
01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:42.029 line:83%
I can give you one last chance to earn a life.

478
01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:44.114 line:83%
However, it might not be the life that you wish.

479
01:10:45.866 --> 01:10:47.743 line:83%
Complete a task for us,

480
01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.870 line:83%
and your Excommunicado will be reversed.

481
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:52.081 line:83%
The open contract closed,

482
01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.124 line:83%
you would be permitted to continue to live.

483
01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:57.252 line:83%
Not free under the Table, but bound to it.

484
01:10:57.252 --> 01:11:00.255 line:83%
Doing what you do best for the rest of your days.

485
01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:06.136 line:83%
The choice is yours.

486
01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:10.641 line:83%
Die here and now.

487
01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:13.644 line:83%
Or continue to live and remember through death.

488
01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:32.997 line:83%
What must be done?

489
01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:36.125 line:83%
The cost of your life will be the death of others.

490
01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.836 line:83%
The first of which will be the man they call Winston.

491
01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.046 line:83%
What?

492
01:11:41.046 --> 01:11:43.841 line:83%
He has forgotten his fealty.

493
01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:46.343 line:83%
Neither the open contract nor the Excommunicado

494
01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:49.013 line:83%
will be lifted until you complete your task.

495
01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:51.640 line:83%
So if you wish to live,

496
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.351 line:83%
and if you wish to remember,

497
01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.228 line:83%
this is the choice you must make.

498
01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.164 line:83%
I will serve.

499
01:12:17.249 --> 01:12:20.294 line:83%
I will be of service.

500
01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.379 line:83%
Very well, my son.

501
01:12:22.379 --> 01:12:24.381 line:83%
Cast aside your weakness

502
01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:27.259 line:83%
and reaffirm your fealty to the table.

503
01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:34.892 line:83%
Mr. John Wick.

504
01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.149 line:83%
Thank you.

505
01:13:25.442 --> 01:13:29.279 line:83%
I accept this offering and your fealty.

506
01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:49.424 line:83%
I wish you good luck on your path.

507
01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:52.219 line:83%
Zahir will help you prepare for your departure.

508
01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:55.180 line:83%
And Mr. Wick.

509
01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:38.182 line:83%
JFK Express now arriving on platform nine.

510
01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:41.101 line:83%
JFK Express now arriving on platform nine.

511
01:16:04.017 --> 01:16:05.519 line:83%
Stick together, kids.

512
01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:06.937 line:83%
Make sure you're holding the hand

513
01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:10.065 line:83%
of the person in front and behind you.

514
01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:15.529 line:83%
You see? That's why you're special, John Wick.

515
01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.576 line:83%
I wouldn't have stopped.

516
01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:23.578 line:83%
It's good to have you back.

517
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.337 line:83%
How was your trip?

518
01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:37.050 line:83%
Going to the Continental?

519
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.975 line:83%
He with you?

520
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:47.269 line:83%
He was.

521
01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:59.072 line:83%
Nice trick.

522
01:20:06.551 --> 01:20:09.262 line:83%
Sir! Put your weapon down.

523
01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:13.517 line:83%
He's Excommunicado.

524
01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.769 line:83%
Unless you wish to become the same,

525
01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:20.273 line:83%
I suggest you lower your gun.

526
01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:28.281 line:83%
I'd like to see the manager.

527
01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.744 line:83%
Of course.

528
01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:35.455 line:83%
If you would be so kind as to follow me.

529
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.262 line:83%
Please take a seat.

530
01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:52.430 line:83%
I will let him know you have arrived.

531
01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:28.758 line:83%
I gotta tell you,

532
01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:31.845 line:83%
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

533
01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:34.889 line:83%
I'm a huge fan. John Wick.

534
01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:40.312 line:83%
And so far, you haven't disappointed.

535
01:21:43.648 --> 01:21:45.817 line:83%
Is that the dog?

536
01:21:45.817 --> 01:21:48.278 line:83%
He likes you.

537
01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:52.490 line:83%
Me? I'm more of a cat person myself.

538
01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:54.659 line:83%
Hey, dog.

539
01:21:57.621 --> 01:22:01.791 line:83%
We're the same, you know. Both given the same gift.

540
01:22:01.791 --> 01:22:03.960 line:83%
We're not the same.

541
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.503 line:83%
Yes, we are.

542
01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:08.965 line:83%
No, we're not.

543
01:22:08.965 --> 01:22:11.551 line:83%
The manager is ready for you now.

544
01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:13.345 line:83%
In the administrative lounge, sir.

545
01:22:31.571 --> 01:22:32.614 line:83%
Sit.

546
01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:35.408 line:83%
Stay.

547
01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:37.827 line:83%
Good dog.

548
01:23:33.883 --> 01:23:36.386 line:83%
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

549
01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:48.398 line:83%
We only use this room on special occasions.

550
01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:52.485 line:83%
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

551
01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:53.945 line:83%
under the table.

552
01:23:55.905 --> 01:23:58.032 line:83%
How was your journey here? Eventful?

553
01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:00.577 line:83%
Yeah.

554
01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:02.746 line:83%
Well, of course.

555
01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:07.000 line:83%
They sent men to kill you, and now you to kill me.

556
01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:10.378 line:83%
Isn't that why you're here?

557
01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:14.883 line:83%
I have served, I will be of service.

558
01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.929 line:83%
But you're having doubts.

559
01:24:19.929 --> 01:24:23.683 line:83%
Just don't make the mistake
of pretending this is personal.

560
01:24:23.683 --> 01:24:25.643 line:83%
If you feel you must,

561
01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:30.440 line:83%
put a bullet through my heart.

562
01:24:36.946 --> 01:24:39.574 line:83%
The High Table has asked me to step down.

563
01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:40.950 line:83%
The hour?

564
01:24:41.659 --> 01:24:42.702 line:83%
The hour.

565
01:24:42.702 --> 01:24:45.121 line:83%
You should have killed me in the Continental.

566
01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.792 line:83%
Maybe I should have.

567
01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:51.461 line:83%
Rules and consequences.

568
01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:52.962 line:83%
Hmm.

569
01:24:52.962 --> 01:24:54.547 line:83%
It seems like everyone is suffering

570
01:24:54.547 --> 01:24:56.925 line:83%
from the consequences of their actions.

571
01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:59.344 line:83%
And you're not stepping down?

572
01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:02.680 line:83%
No.

573
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.642 line:83%
I don't think I am.

574
01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:07.644 line:83%
So it's war?

575
01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:09.813 line:83%
You're going to war with the High Table?

576
01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:11.940 line:83%
Skirmish.

577
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.024 line:83%
Unless you decide to shoot me.

578
01:25:13.024 --> 01:25:16.861 line:83%
But, then, I'd rather die at the hand of a friend

579
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:20.073 line:83%
than that of an enemy.

580
01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:22.867 line:83%
No, I've made my choice. It's up to you to make yours.

581
01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.830 line:83%
What choice?

582
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:29.666 line:83%
You shoot me, you sell your soul.

583
01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:33.837 line:83%
But I'll be alive. And I can remember her.

584
01:25:33.878 --> 01:25:36.673 line:83%
Until you die as a servant of the High Table.

585
01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:41.177 line:83%
Now, you did the impossible, you stopped, you got out.

586
01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:44.722 line:83%
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

587
01:25:44.722 --> 01:25:48.726 line:83%
The real question is, who do you wish to die as?

588
01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:50.937 line:83%
The Baba Yaga?

589
01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:53.064 line:83%
The last thing many men ever see?

590
01:25:53.064 --> 01:25:58.069 line:83%
Or as a man who loved and was loved by his wife?

591
01:25:58.069 --> 01:26:00.780 line:83%
Who do you wish to die as, Jonathan?

592
01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:35.899 line:83%
Mr. Wick, it's a pleasure to meet you.

593
01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:37.609 line:83%
I am an Adjudicator.

594
01:26:39.068 --> 01:26:40.862 line:83%
Have you decided to step down?

595
01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:46.242 line:83%
I think not.

596
01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:49.537 line:83%
And you? Will you be putting a bullet in his head?

597
01:26:52.832 --> 01:26:55.960 line:83%
No, I don't think I will.

598
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.969 line:83%
Very well.

599
01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.979 line:83%
Administration.

600
01:27:14.979 --> 01:27:16.981 line:83%
I'd like to change a designation.

601
01:27:17.857 --> 01:27:19.025 line:83%
Verification?

602
01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:22.278 line:83%
Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.

603
01:27:22.278 --> 01:27:24.322 line:83%
The Continental Hotel, New York.

604
01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:26.282 line:83%
New designation?

605
01:27:26.282 --> 01:27:27.825 line:83%
Deconsecrated.

606
01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:31.663 line:83%
Processing.

607
01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:35.166 line:83%
Administrator.

608
01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:40.838 line:83%
File. The New York Continental Hotel.

609
01:27:51.224 --> 01:27:55.728 line:83%
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

610
01:28:03.027 --> 01:28:05.655 line:83%
Gentlemen, this institution is now deconsecrated.

611
01:28:05.655 --> 01:28:08.324 line:83%
Business may now be conducted on Continental grounds.

612
01:28:08.324 --> 01:28:10.618 line:83%
Since you are refusing to step down

613
01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:15.039 line:83%
and you are refusing a direct order,
your lives are now forfeit.

614
01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:17.166 line:83%
High Table emissaries will be joining you presently

615
01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:19.877 line:83%
to see the removal of your souls from the property.

616
01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:23.089 line:83%
Good evening, gentlemen.

617
01:28:27.176 --> 01:28:30.555 line:83%
This haven is safe no more.

618
01:28:33.224 --> 01:28:36.019 line:83%
Are services still off limits to me?

619
01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:38.146 line:83%
Under the circumstances,

620
01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:40.189 line:83%
your privileges are reinstated immediately.

621
01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:41.733 line:83%
What do you need?

622
01:28:42.191 --> 01:28:45.653 line:83%
Guns. Lots of guns.

623
01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:05.840 line:83%
Let's make a withdrawal.

624
01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:31.324 line:83%
Remember, sir.

625
01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:33.910 line:83%
These will be High Table forces.

626
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:36.245 line:83%
We may have to consider our choices carefully.

627
01:29:36.954 --> 01:29:38.206 line:83%
Why?

628
01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:39.957 line:83%
Much has changed during your time away.

629
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:41.876 line:83%
Like what?

630
01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:44.796 line:83%
Well, let us say they have made armor improvements.

631
01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:56.766 line:83%
May I suggest the 2011 Combat Master

632
01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:58.976 line:83%
in combination with the nine millimeter major.

633
01:30:10.446 --> 01:30:12.281 line:83%
Attention, all guests.

634
01:30:12.281 --> 01:30:15.868 line:83%
The Continental Hotel is closing for fumigation.

635
01:30:15.868 --> 01:30:17.495 line:83%
We apologize for the inconvenience.

636
01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:19.664 line:83%
Please make your way to the nearest exit.

637
01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:27.130 line:83%
Attention, all guests. The Continental Hotel...

638
01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:30.800 line:83%
It seems circumstances have changed in your favor.

639
01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.343 line:83%
Your transaction may now be conducted

640
01:30:32.343 --> 01:30:34.053 line:83%
on Continental grounds.

641
01:30:39.892 --> 01:30:43.104 line:83%
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

642
01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:46.065 line:83%
Cool. Very cool.

643
01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:55.867 line:83%
125 grain, 1,425 feet per second.

644
01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:57.785 line:83%
Serious business.

645
01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:02.331 line:83%
Thank you.

646
01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:04.041 line:83%
Let us begin.

647
01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:53.192 line:83%
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

648
01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:55.611 line:83%
Of course, sir.

649
01:33:16.966 --> 01:33:19.635 line:83%
I know you'll do the Continental proud.

650
01:33:19.677 --> 01:33:21.345 line:83%
I'll see you soon, sir.

651
01:33:24.348 --> 01:33:27.977 line:83%
And you, Jonathan, do what you do best.

652
01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.186 line:83%
What's that?

653
01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:31.314 line:83%
Hunt.

654
01:37:04.735 --> 01:37:08.197 line:83%
Winston! Winston!

655
01:37:12.284 --> 01:37:14.703 line:83%
I need more firepower.

656
01:37:37.434 --> 01:37:39.395 line:83%
Armor improvements.

657
01:37:39.436 --> 01:37:42.439 line:83%
12-gauge steel slugs. Armor-piercing.

658
01:41:09.855 --> 01:41:11.940 line:83%
Only by my sword, John.

659
01:41:24.077 --> 01:41:26.538 line:83%
I know you believe you can keep this up.

660
01:41:26.538 --> 01:41:27.748 line:83%
But I assure you...

661
01:49:32.941 --> 01:49:35.485 line:83%
John, you're incredible.

662
01:49:36.444 --> 01:49:37.487 line:83%
Exhausted,

663
01:49:38.113 --> 01:49:40.031 line:83%
outnumbered...

664
01:49:40.031 --> 01:49:41.324 line:83%
Obviously in pain.

665
01:49:42.534 --> 01:49:45.245 line:83%
And you still beat all of my students.

666
01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:47.163 line:83%
If I didn't have to kill you,

667
01:49:47.664 --> 01:49:50.166 line:83%
we'd be pals.

668
01:49:50.625 --> 01:49:52.294 line:83%
Let's do this.

669
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:22.532 line:83%
See? We're the same.

670
01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:11.886 line:83%
I would like to suggest a parley.

671
01:54:11.928 --> 01:54:13.638 line:83%
A parley would be good.

672
01:54:13.638 --> 01:54:15.098 line:83%
Very well.

673
01:54:26.234 --> 01:54:27.777 line:83%
Are we in play, sir?

674
01:54:29.529 --> 01:54:30.780 line:83%
Oh, very much so.

675
01:54:50.425 --> 01:54:51.926 line:83%
Hey, John.

676
01:54:54.345 --> 01:54:56.681 line:83%
That was a pretty good fight, huh?

677
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.769 line:83%
Yeah.

678
01:55:31.382 --> 01:55:33.343 line:83%
Yeah.

679
01:55:33.343 --> 01:55:36.804 line:83%
Don't worry about me, John.

680
01:55:36.804 --> 01:55:38.931 line:83%
I just gotta catch my breath.

681
01:55:40.808 --> 01:55:42.560 line:83%
I'll catch up to you, John.

682
01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:49.692 line:83%
No, you won't.

683
01:56:00.411 --> 01:56:01.496 line:83%
You gentlemen, of course,

684
01:56:01.496 --> 01:56:03.748 line:83%
realize that was the first wave.

685
01:56:03.748 --> 01:56:06.334 line:83%
Merely an amuse-bouche.

686
01:56:06.334 --> 01:56:07.877 line:83%
We can keep this up as long as you'd like,

687
01:56:07.877 --> 01:56:09.671 line:83%
but it only ends one way.

688
01:56:09.671 --> 01:56:12.340 line:83%
Are you sure a protracted war is the best way forward?

689
01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:14.634 line:83%
There won't be anything "protracted" about it.

690
01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:15.843 line:83%
Oh, you can take the Continental,

691
01:56:15.843 --> 01:56:16.886 line:83%
I have no doubt about that.

692
01:56:16.886 --> 01:56:19.555 line:83%
But keeping it, that's a different matter entirely.

693
01:56:19.555 --> 01:56:22.725 line:83%
My allegiances run way beyond this building.

694
01:56:23.601 --> 01:56:25.311 line:83%
We are High Table.

695
01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:27.230 line:83%
And we

696
01:56:28.356 --> 01:56:29.982 line:83%
are New York City.

697
01:56:31.025 --> 01:56:32.735 line:83%
Are we negotiating?

698
01:56:34.737 --> 01:56:35.780 line:83%
Hmm.

699
01:56:36.531 --> 01:56:37.865 line:83%
I believe we are.

700
01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:44.664 line:83%
Parley?

701
01:56:45.581 --> 01:56:46.874 line:83%
Parley.

702
01:56:50.461 --> 01:56:52.588 line:83%
What do you propose we do?

703
01:56:56.718 --> 01:56:58.636 line:83%
Let me keep my power.

704
01:56:59.095 --> 01:57:00.430 line:83%
Under the Table.

705
01:57:03.391 --> 01:57:04.892 line:83%
I have served

706
01:57:04.892 --> 01:57:07.854 line:83%
and been a beacon of order and stability

707
01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:09.981 line:83%
to our industry for over 40 years.

708
01:57:09.981 --> 01:57:12.567 line:83%
Now, I humbly acknowledge I overstepped

709
01:57:12.567 --> 01:57:15.486 line:83%
and re-pledge my fealty to the High Table.

710
01:57:17.822 --> 01:57:19.407 line:83%
Winston.

711
01:57:24.954 --> 01:57:26.706 line:83%
You were merely showing strength

712
01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:29.292 line:83%
so we would let you keep the Continental.

713
01:57:32.795 --> 01:57:35.715 line:83%
The High Table accepts your fealty.

714
01:57:36.966 --> 01:57:38.468 line:83%
But what about him?

715
01:57:40.595 --> 01:57:44.015 line:83%
What are we going to do about John Wick?

716
01:57:49.604 --> 01:57:51.355 line:83%
Oh, he has to die.

717
01:57:52.774 --> 01:57:54.734 line:83%
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- Winston!

718
01:57:54.734 --> 01:57:55.985 line:83%
Don't see any other way.

719
01:58:07.872 --> 01:58:09.707 line:83%
Very well, gentlemen.

720
01:58:09.707 --> 01:58:12.919 line:83%
The Continental will now be reconsecrated.

721
01:58:13.878 --> 01:58:15.755 line:83%
Good day to you both.

722
01:58:19.801 --> 01:58:21.469 line:83%
Well played, sir.

723
01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:59.799 line:83%
How long do you estimate until we reopen?

724
01:58:59.799 --> 01:59:01.551 line:83%
Oh, should be no time at all.

725
01:59:05.555 --> 01:59:07.473 line:83%
Mr. Wick is gone.

726
01:59:07.473 --> 01:59:09.183 line:83%
A true tragedy.

727
01:59:09.183 --> 01:59:10.726 line:83%
You misunderstand.

728
01:59:10.726 --> 01:59:13.729 line:83%
I mean that he is no longer on the street.

729
01:59:13.729 --> 01:59:14.897 line:83%
That seems improbable.

730
01:59:14.897 --> 01:59:16.232 line:83%
And yet, true.

731
01:59:17.692 --> 01:59:20.695 line:83%
I trust you understand
the repercussions if he survives.

732
01:59:20.695 --> 01:59:22.947 line:83%
Both from above and below.

733
01:59:22.947 --> 01:59:24.699 line:83%
The last thing either one of us needs

734
01:59:24.699 --> 01:59:26.909 line:83%
is Mr. Wick paying us a visit in the night.

735
01:59:29.871 --> 01:59:31.873 line:83%
For both our sakes, I'll hope you see to it

736
01:59:31.873 --> 01:59:34.125 line:83%
that this situation is taken care of, yes?

737
01:59:34.125 --> 01:59:37.837 line:83%
Absolutely. How far can he get?

738
01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:50.975 line:83%
Baba Yaga.

739
02:00:03.738 --> 02:00:04.864 line:83%
Mmm.

740
02:00:22.298 --> 02:00:24.800 line:83%
How you doing, John?

741
02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:27.553 line:83%
You look as bad as I feel.

742
02:00:29.263 --> 02:00:32.099 line:83%
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

743
02:00:32.099 --> 02:00:34.602 line:83%
Raise a hand if you can hear me, John.

744
02:00:37.188 --> 02:00:40.107 line:83%
Oh, shit. They took a finger.

745
02:00:40.107 --> 02:00:42.735 line:83%
Ain't that a bitch?

746
02:00:48.157 --> 02:00:52.161 line:83%
Oh, John fucking Wick.

747
02:00:52.161 --> 02:00:54.872 line:83%
So, the old boy keeps his hotel

748
02:00:54.872 --> 02:00:56.290 line:83%
and you take the fall.

749
02:00:56.290 --> 02:00:57.416 line:83%
Can't say I blame him.

750
02:00:57.416 --> 02:00:59.919 line:83%
I would've done the same thing if I was in his shoes.

751
02:01:00.836 --> 02:01:03.631 line:83%
But this High Table shit...

752
02:01:06.634 --> 02:01:08.219 line:83%
Seven cuts.

753
02:01:11.847 --> 02:01:14.600 line:83%
Under the Table is where shit gets done.

754
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:19.313 line:83%
And they're about to find out, if you cut a king,

755
02:01:19.313 --> 02:01:21.732 line:83%
you better cut him to the quick.

756
02:01:26.237 --> 02:01:27.738 line:83%
So...

757
02:01:30.241 --> 02:01:32.034 line:83%
Let me ask you, John.

758
02:01:32.702 --> 02:01:33.703 line:83%
How do you feel?

759
02:01:36.205 --> 02:01:40.668 line:83%
'Cause I am really pissed off.

760
02:01:41.293 --> 02:01:43.254 line:83%
You pissed, John?

761
02:01:43.254 --> 02:01:44.714 line:83%
Hmm?

762
02:01:44.714 --> 02:01:45.840 line:83%
Are you?

763
02:01:55.683 --> 02:01:57.268 line:83%
Yeah.
