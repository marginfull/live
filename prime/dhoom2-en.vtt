00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:23.000 line:82%
- Same.
- Where's the stuff?

81
00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:26.250 line:82%
Payments.

82
00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:28.750 line:82%
I've heard you work with the cops.

83
00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:31.333 line:82%
Ali and the cops
just don't get along.

84
00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:33.254 line:82%
I hope you understand.

85
00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:36.312 line:82%
Original!

86
00:11:37.792 --> 00:11:38.958 line:82%
Original.

87
00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.500 line:82%
Ok, brother. I'm off now.

88
00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:49.167 line:82%
Ali!

89
00:11:53.167 --> 00:11:55.088 line:82%
You dropped something.

90
00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:57.896 line:82%
MAHARASHTRA STATE POLICE.
ALI AKBHAR. SUB INSPECTOR.

91
00:12:00.542 --> 00:12:02.708 line:82%
This is not mine. My friend...

92
00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:05.250 line:82%
...he works with the cops.
His name is Ali.

93
00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:06.750 line:82%
This powder is fake.

94
00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:11.208 line:82%
You said powder buddy.
So it's powder.

95
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.702 line:82%
There's a transmitter too.

96
00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:16.642 line:82%
- That's not mine either. See you guys.
- Ali.

97
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.750 line:82%
Sorry. I'm sorry, really sorry.
Please forgive me.

98
00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:23.875 line:82%
I'm just like you guys.
A dealer. I swear.

99
00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:25.458 line:82%
I've been trapped in this
by Jai Dixit. He's crazy.

100
00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:27.042 line:82%
He conned me to come here as a cop.

101
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.708 line:82%
I told him I didn't want to cheat
on you guys.

102
00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:34.250 line:82%
Hey! We are just like brothers,
aren't we? Okay, I'll leave.

103
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.708 line:82%
One minute. I'll join you guys
from today. How's that?

104
00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:41.167 line:82%
And together we'll rock man!

105
00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:44.333 line:82%
Every part in my body is illegal.
Don't mistake me for a cop.

106
00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:48.292 line:82%
Don't handcuff me.
I'm a thief, not a cop.

107
00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:51.500 line:82%
Brother, we are like brothers.
Brother. No!

108
00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:58.208 line:82%
Look brother, I have one
last wish before I die.

109
00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:00.750 line:82%
Promise me,
after killing me you'll...

110
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.667 line:82%
...shoot that lowly
Jai Dixit in the head!

111
00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:05.138 line:82%
Ever since I saw his face,
my life is ruined!

112
00:13:06.042 --> 00:13:07.958 line:82%
- Finish him!
- Sit down.

113
00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:12.708 line:82%
Just a minute. I can't see myself die.
Let me shut my eyes.

114
00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:18.000 line:82%
I'm going. Bye everybody.
Mummy!

115
00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:19.958 line:82%
Someone save me please!

116
00:14:32.292 --> 00:14:34.552 line:82%
Now you're going to say,
I saved you. Right.

117
00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:37.667 line:82%
I could have died, man.

118
00:14:38.083 --> 00:14:40.194 line:82%
You can't do one thing properly.

119
00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:43.000 line:82%
Every time I have to forget
the goons and save you.

120
00:14:43.292 --> 00:14:46.049 line:82%
Hey! Hey relax!
I had already taken care of them.

121
00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.417 line:82%
Sorry, I was just kidding.

122
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.000 line:82%
I am nothing without you.

123
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.500 line:82%
Like a cylinder without gas.

124
00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:53.542 line:82%
A monkey without a tail.

125
00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:02.066 line:82%
Where are you, Jai?

126
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.958 line:82%
- Sweetie!
- Sweetie is dead!

127
00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:06.083 line:82%
Sweetie I'm at work.
Can we talk later?

128
00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:09.000 line:82%
Later? Later you'll
see my dead body. Got it?

129
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.653 line:82%
You understand nothing.
How do I explain to you?

130
00:15:11.917 --> 00:15:13.750 line:82%
Remember Jai, you have
put me in this condition.

131
00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:14.958 line:82%
It's all because of you.

132
00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:17.250 line:82%
I am here alone at home and
you are least bothered about it.

133
00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:18.583 line:82%
What are you talking about?
What have I done?

134
00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:20.244 line:82%
You have put me in this condition.

135
00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:24.750 line:82%
Sweetie, if I keep
talking to you like this...

136
00:15:25.042 --> 00:15:26.333 line:82%
- Pomfret... pomfret.
- What?

137
00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:27.708 line:82%
Get it from anywhere.

138
00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:30.305 line:82%
I don't know anything.
I want fish right now.

139
00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:38.417 line:82%
Hello, yes. Thank you.

140
00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:40.500 line:82%
Very okay. Hold.

141
00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:45.088 line:82%
Brother. Miss Alka Mathur
from Standard Bank.

142
00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:46.958 line:82%
She wants to give us credit cards.

143
00:15:47.917 --> 00:15:49.383 line:82%
Should I ask for both of us?

144
00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:51.292 line:82%
Hello. What are you
doing this evening?

145
00:15:51.542 --> 00:15:54.233 line:82%
Why don't we meet up.
Give me your phone number.

146
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.219 line:82%
Wow! What a cool jet ski!
Can I ride it?

147
00:16:28.292 --> 00:16:29.458 line:82%
No you won't!

148
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:31.836 line:82%
Then how am I going?

149
00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:36.625 line:82%
Brother, save me!
The water is very cold!

150
00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:40.375 line:82%
Brother Jai! I can't swim!

151
00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:49.583 line:82%
If you take so much time to cook...

152
00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:51.750 line:82%
...I wonder how long
you'll take to change diapers.

153
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.750 line:82%
Sweetie, that's no way to talk.

154
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.572 line:82%
And what will you do
if I talk this way?

155
00:16:57.917 --> 00:16:59.042 line:82%
Affair!

156
00:17:00.458 --> 00:17:03.750 line:82%
I don't say so. My aunt says
90 per cent married men...

157
00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.462 line:82%
...have affairs when
their wives are pregnant.

158
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.333 line:82%
Aunt Usha knows everything.

159
00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:11.125 line:82%
She delivers babies
in the entire Nagpada.

160
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.029 line:82%
Now, tell me Jai,
would you have an affair?

161
00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:16.281 line:82%
You think I could do that?

162
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.825 line:82%
Who are you going to get
to have an affair with you?

163
00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:22.018 line:82%
Poor Sweetie.

164
00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.042 line:82%
- She's stuck with you...
- What do you mean?

165
00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:28.375 line:82%
I mean that a girl's got to be
nuts to have an affair with you.

166
00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:32.833 line:82%
He's right Jai.
I'm the only one for you!

167
00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:34.833 line:82%
I'm not scared of
any Seeta or Geeta.

168
00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:38.686 line:82%
No girl's going to agree
to go out with you.

169
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.125 line:82%
Mr. Grumpy, you don't
know how to treat women.

170
00:17:45.454 --> 00:17:47.583 line:82%
And they generally
prefer poets, like me.

171
00:17:47.792 --> 00:17:48.667 line:82%
Right?

172
00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:50.250 line:82%
Poet! You?

173
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.833 line:82%
Yes, I'm a poet! Love has
no age, it has always been.

174
00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:58.250 line:82%
Love has no age,
it has always been.

175
00:17:58.667 --> 00:17:59.917 line:82%
Fifteen, sixteen,
seventeen, eighteen.

176
00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:05.757 line:82%
Don't push it guys. I am decent,
so I don't fool around.

177
00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:08.179 line:82%
But I might just go ahead
if I wished, okay?

178
00:18:08.708 --> 00:18:11.651 line:82%
Alright. Go ahead, have an affair.

179
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.083 line:82%
But...

180
00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:14.417 line:82%
Where will you find that girl?

181
00:18:32.583 --> 00:18:36.208 line:82%
Don't you want to know me?
Love me like a baby.

182
00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:40.750 line:82%
Don't you want to show me?
Come on. Come. Baby.

183
00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:43.208 line:82%
Love to love you, baby.

184
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.500 line:82%
Love to love you, baby.

185
00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:47.997 line:82%
Love to love you, baby.

186
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.750 line:82%
That's my love.

187
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:53.914 line:82%
Don't you want to know me?
Love me like a baby.

188
00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:56.905 line:82%
Don't you want to show me?

189
00:18:57.583 --> 00:18:59.250 line:82%
Come on, come on, baby.

190
00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:10.292 line:82%
ACP Shonali Bose reporting, sir!

191
00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:12.237 line:82%
Welcome to Mumbai!

192
00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:17.167 line:82%
Wait here, I'll send the officer
in charge of this case.

193
00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:19.604 line:82%
- He is our best man.
- Sir.

194
00:20:01.708 --> 00:20:04.844 line:82%
- Hello, how do you do?
- Who are you?

195
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.875 line:82%
Some style!

196
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.667 line:82%
You're the one with the handcuffs
on and you're asking me?

197
00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:15.897 line:82%
Now tell me what are you in for?

198
00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:21.708 line:82%
Take it easy. I'm a cool headed guy.
Everybody makes mistakes.

199
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.917 line:82%
But if you cooperate with me then,
everything will be fine.

200
00:20:25.667 --> 00:20:28.833 line:82%
Cops and criminals
should be like couples...

201
00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:31.917 line:82%
...you know, like a husband and wife.

202
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.417 line:82%
Once that happens, the world
will be a better place and...

203
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:36.000 line:82%
...all crime will vanish.
Just like that!

204
00:20:36.208 --> 00:20:38.500 line:82%
Shut up! I'm not a criminal!

205
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:44.583 line:82%
Look, you better speak up darling,
because when Ali 'entrygates...'

206
00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:46.416 line:82%
Interrogates.

207
00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:49.875 line:82%
Yes, that's the word.
When I do what you just said...

208
00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:53.167 line:82%
...the toughest of criminals
confess everything.

209
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.167 line:82%
Get that! Now speak up.
You got it?

210
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.542 line:82%
You're a cop?

211
00:20:58.875 --> 00:21:03.333 line:82%
Well, I know I look like an actor.

212
00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:06.917 line:82%
But actually I am a cop.
Ali Akbhar. Sub-inspector.

213
00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:09.801 line:82%
Just remove my handcuff.
It got stuck by mistake.

214
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.708 line:82%
Don't try to fool me darling!

215
00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:15.893 line:82%
Handcuffs are not something
that you put on by mistake.

216
00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:18.833 line:82%
Tell me the truth.

217
00:21:19.167 --> 00:21:20.480 line:82%
Because of you. Well,
they were in my hand.

218
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.167 line:82%
I was moving it aside when
you opened the door suddenly.

219
00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:24.500 line:82%
And this thing...

220
00:21:24.792 --> 00:21:26.609 line:82%
It doesn't happen like that,
darling.

221
00:21:26.917 --> 00:21:30.167 line:82%
You were moving it aside, right?
And...

222
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.750 line:82%
Oh, I was just 'entrygate'.

223
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.035 line:82%
She has committed some
crime but not admitting it.

224
00:21:36.458 --> 00:21:37.940 line:82%
- Her name is...
- Shonali Bose.

225
00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:41.251 line:82%
Jai Dixit? I don't believe this!

226
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.081 line:82%
- Shonali Bose. Roll number 23.
- Jai Dixit, Mr. Long Legs.

227
00:21:46.458 --> 00:21:47.875 line:82%
The boy who never dared to go in...

228
00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:49.583 line:82%
...the swimming pool
because of his long legs.

229
00:21:49.792 --> 00:21:51.667 line:82%
I didn't want to give
you any competition...

230
00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:53.333 line:82%
...because everybody
would come to see you.

231
00:21:53.542 --> 00:21:55.417 line:82%
- You are a show off.
- Show off and me?

232
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.083 line:82%
And the girls' hostel?
Pooja Mehta's room.

233
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.250 line:82%
Weren't you caught sneaking
in there?

234
00:21:58.458 --> 00:22:00.295 line:82%
Yes, right. I remember. You still
owe me 25 rupees for the bet.

235
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:03.724 line:82%
Don't you want to know me?
Love me like a baby.

236
00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:06.367 line:82%
Don't you want to show me?

237
00:22:15.875 --> 00:22:18.292 line:82%
- So good to see you.
- 7 years, 7 months...

238
00:22:18.583 --> 00:22:20.500 line:82%
Wow! You know the
exact number of days?

239
00:22:20.792 --> 00:22:22.625 line:82%
Yes, I do.
Once a girl dances with you...

240
00:22:22.792 --> 00:22:24.125 line:82%
...she can never ever
forget you, that's for sure.

241
00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:29.792 line:82%
Jai and dance! No way?
I mean, Jai... you?

242
00:22:31.042 --> 00:22:32.792 line:82%
Anyway. What are you doing here?

243
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:39.525 line:82%
A! The smartest and
coolest thief in the world.

244
00:22:39.917 --> 00:22:44.333 line:82%
Smart because he dares
to do the impossible and...

245
00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:51.234 line:82%
...cool because he leaves no
clue behind. Only his symbol, A.

246
00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:54.375 line:82%
We don't have anything
else apart from this.

247
00:22:55.542 --> 00:22:58.375 line:82%
- No description? No sketch?
- Nothing, sir.

248
00:22:58.917 --> 00:23:01.708 line:82%
From Rio De Janeiro to Jaipur,
all the heists he...

249
00:23:01.917 --> 00:23:03.333 line:82%
...has pulled off were in disguise.

250
00:23:03.708 --> 00:23:06.375 line:82%
He stole the Queen's antique
crown disguised as the Queen.

251
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.697 line:82%
He is the master of disguises.

252
00:23:09.042 --> 00:23:11.417 line:82%
And no one knows how
he vanished from the train.

253
00:23:11.708 --> 00:23:14.667 line:82%
Excuse, Ali to say. Since the
robbery took place on a train...

254
00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:16.417 line:82%
...shouldn't the case
be under the Railways...

255
00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:19.417 line:82%
For the last 2 years, I have
been following Mr. A's case.

256
00:23:19.792 --> 00:23:23.375 line:82%
He always robs things that
are rare, almost priceless.

257
00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:26.667 line:82%
A diamond from London,
painting from Paris...

258
00:23:26.917 --> 00:23:28.708 line:82%
...necklace from the crown
of the prince of Istanbul.

259
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.250 line:82%
But he's got to be selling all this
priceless stuff somewhere. Right?

260
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.542 line:82%
Unfortunately, we don't know
what he does with the stolen goods.

261
00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:40.500 line:82%
Every year he works just about
3-4 months and then disappears.

262
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:44.292 line:82%
Is there anything else,
like a pattern or something?

263
00:23:44.583 --> 00:23:47.042 line:82%
What is significant
is the way he robs.

264
00:23:47.417 --> 00:23:50.333 line:82%
And he's committed the
thefts so randomly...

265
00:23:50.586 --> 00:23:52.167 line:82%
...that it's impossible
to find a pattern.

266
00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:55.977 line:82%
There is a pattern, Shonali.

267
00:23:58.417 --> 00:24:02.004 line:82%
What is interesting is
the signature.

268
00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:05.792 line:82%
That's what he leaves behind
at each crime scene.

269
00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:08.542 line:82%
But what he's really after...

270
00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:14.625 line:82%
...is to leave his mark
all over the world.

271
00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:16.393 line:82%
CAIRO. ANKARA. BISHKEK.
HANDI. NAMIBIA.

272
00:24:17.792 --> 00:24:19.497 line:82%
And that's not all.

273
00:24:23.458 --> 00:24:27.125 line:82%
14th July 2006.
The date of the next robbery.

274
00:24:29.792 --> 00:24:31.554 line:82%
How do you say that?

275
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.536 line:82%
Besides antiques,
Mr. A is fascinated by numbers too.

276
00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:45.750 line:82%
Seoul: 5/4/2004.
If you add up all the numbers...

277
00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:53.667 line:82%
...5+4+2+4=15, you get the date
for the next robbery, 15/7/2004.

278
00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:57.750 line:82%
Once again, the total adds
up to 28. And the next...

279
00:24:57.958 --> 00:25:02.417 line:82%
...robbery at Australia
on 28/9/2005. Total 44.

280
00:25:03.208 --> 00:25:08.583 line:82%
When the total exceeds 30 he
adds the total, 4+4. - 44!

281
00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:17.125 line:82%
8. The next robbery: 8/1/2006...

282
00:25:17.833 --> 00:25:20.542 line:82%
...the date of every robbery lies
in the date of the previous robbery.

283
00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:22.750 line:82%
Mr. A is making every
effort to challenge us.

284
00:25:23.042 --> 00:25:26.417 line:82%
But the problem is that nobody
understood his challenge.

285
00:25:26.833 --> 00:25:29.269 line:82%
But you got it. Fantastic!

286
00:25:30.792 --> 00:25:32.625 line:82%
And the train robbery
took place on the...

287
00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:35.948 line:82%
...1/5/2006, Total: 14.

288
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.171 line:82%
The next robbery is going
to take place on 14th July...

289
00:25:40.577 --> 00:25:41.883 line:82%
CAIRO. ANKARA. BISHKEK.
HANDI. NAMIBIA. MOSCOW.

290
00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:45.542 line:82%
- ...Mumbai.
- How's that?

291
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.641 line:82%
Because he wants to make the
symbol 'A' on the world map...

292
00:25:50.583 --> 00:25:52.333 line:82%
To complete the 'A'...
the line must cross Mumbai...

293
00:25:52.575 --> 00:25:53.701 line:82%
CAIRO. ANKARA. BISHKEK. SEOUL.
HANDI. NAMIBIA. MOSCOW. MUMBAI.

294
00:25:54.917 --> 00:25:58.125 line:82%
We better get cracking
before he gets here.

295
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.333 line:82%
If I am not wrong,
he's already here!

296
00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:17.500 line:82%
And if my guess is right,
he's one step ahead of us.

297
00:26:29.292 --> 00:26:31.542 line:82%
Mr. A always robs in disguise...

298
00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:35.294 line:82%
...and yet he wants the whole world
to know who he is.

299
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.125 line:82%
The signature says it all.

300
00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:51.781 line:82%
He thinks he's an artist,
not a thief. An unknown artist!

301
00:26:53.708 --> 00:26:59.101 line:82%
Such an artist, though he is
amongst us, is hidden!

302
00:27:15.708 --> 00:27:19.083 line:82%
You can't look for him.
You can only catch him.

303
00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:28.833 line:82%
But nabbing such a smart
thief is going to be tough.

304
00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:38.583 line:82%
Perfect!

305
00:27:39.292 --> 00:27:40.292 line:82%
He's the perfect thief!

306
00:27:57.292 --> 00:28:01.573 line:82%
Create excitement!

307
00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:03.958 line:82%
Create excitement!

308
00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:06.994 line:82%
It'll be great meeting you, Mr. A!

309
00:28:07.667 --> 00:28:08.625 line:82%
Everybody say...

310
00:28:08.833 --> 00:28:10.382 line:82%
I think we will have fun.

311
00:28:12.292 --> 00:28:13.833 line:82%
We want the fury.

312
00:28:14.792 --> 00:28:18.300 line:82%
In college, I never thought a girl
like you would join the police force.

313
00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:20.542 line:82%
- Your peppers.
- Thanks.

314
00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:23.042 line:82%
Why did you feel that way?

315
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.542 line:82%
Dressing.

316
00:28:26.292 --> 00:28:27.375 line:82%
No, no.

317
00:28:28.792 --> 00:28:30.833 line:82%
You were such a sissy. I mean...

318
00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:34.542 line:82%
...you wouldn't talk to anyone,
and stuck up.

319
00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:37.762 line:82%
I would talk to you though...

320
00:28:40.542 --> 00:28:44.268 line:82%
That's because you were
secretly in love with me.

321
00:28:45.542 --> 00:28:48.707 line:82%
I'm still in love with you.

322
00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:57.567 line:82%
Whatever you do,
don't think of divorce.

323
00:28:58.458 --> 00:29:01.727 line:82%
Divorce is bad for family life.

324
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.750 line:82%
Not divorce,
I'm thinking of murder.

325
00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:08.333 line:82%
- If you don't mind.
- No. - I'll just be back.

326
00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:09.917 line:82%
Your fish.

327
00:29:10.792 --> 00:29:12.958 line:82%
Sweetie, your husband is too sexy.

328
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.375 line:82%
And he is such a great cook.

329
00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:16.167 line:82%
How did you manage
to trap him? Tell me.

330
00:29:17.688 --> 00:29:19.083 line:82%
You've got to see this.

331
00:29:22.917 --> 00:29:25.670 line:82%
Sho! You were like
an ugly duckling in college.

332
00:29:25.917 --> 00:29:28.250 line:82%
What rubbish! I was the
hottest girl in college!

333
00:29:28.583 --> 00:29:29.750 line:82%
I was the most wanted.

334
00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:32.381 line:82%
Give me a break!
Did you see yourself?

335
00:29:34.417 --> 00:29:37.486 line:82%
Look, who is this?
Who's looking dumb here?

336
00:29:37.792 --> 00:29:39.500 line:82%
Anybody would look stupid
in a sarong.

337
00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:42.667 line:82%
- You wore a sarong?
- Must have been a bet. Right?

338
00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:44.022 line:82%
Bingo! Bet for 10 bucks.

339
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.875 line:82%
Whose sarong was it?

340
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.290 line:82%
Hers. Naturally!

341
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000 line:82%
Sho! Remember that.
Parrot green dress.

342
00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.170 line:82%
- You still have that?
- What?

343
00:29:56.167 --> 00:29:58.417 line:82%
There's a college reunion
party tomorrow. Class of '96.

344
00:29:58.875 --> 00:29:59.917 line:82%
And everyone's going to wear what...

345
00:30:00.167 --> 00:30:01.750 line:82%
...we used to wear in college.
So, I thought...

346
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:03.208 line:82%
Reunion!

347
00:30:03.792 --> 00:30:06.431 line:82%
Yes. And now you're in town.
We will go together, it will be fun.

348
00:30:06.833 --> 00:30:08.583 line:82%
But I have nothing to wear.

349
00:30:08.792 --> 00:30:10.125 line:82%
Why don't you borrow
one of Sweetie's clothes?

350
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:12.625 line:82%
No problem, come,
I will show you. Come.

351
00:30:21.375 --> 00:30:25.798 line:82%
2 murders instead of 1, the
punishment remains the same, right?

352
00:30:27.167 --> 00:30:27.835 line:82%
No Sweetie...

353
00:30:29.625 --> 00:30:31.292 line:82%
I vowed to mummy that I'll keep...

354
00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:33.833 line:82%
...away from trouble and women.

355
00:30:34.167 --> 00:30:36.667 line:82%
But for you and your family,
Montu...

356
00:30:36.875 --> 00:30:38.167 line:82%
...Ali part two, I'll
break that promise.

357
00:30:38.417 --> 00:30:39.917 line:82%
What are you talking about, Ali?

358
00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:42.404 line:82%
I have a plan. I'm going to
make her fall in love with me...

359
00:30:42.614 --> 00:30:46.083 line:82%
...and then she'll forget Jai.
Ali will charm her...

360
00:30:46.292 --> 00:30:48.083 line:82%
And your family will be fine.

361
00:30:48.333 --> 00:30:50.792 line:82%
- But how are you going to do that?
- Like this.

362
00:31:25.542 --> 00:31:27.333 line:82%
O Baby!

363
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:29.756 line:82%
O Baby!

364
00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:32.003 line:82%
O Baby!

365
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:34.667 line:82%
My love!

366
00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:36.625 line:82%
O Baby!

367
00:31:37.118 --> 00:31:39.025 line:82%
O Baby!

368
00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:41.250 line:82%
O Baby!

369
00:31:43.042 --> 00:31:43.794 line:82%
My love!

370
00:31:46.333 --> 00:31:50.500 line:82%
The fire in your eyes burns me
through and through.

371
00:31:50.958 --> 00:31:55.042 line:82%
So don't look at me like that.
My senses come crashing through.

372
00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:59.708 line:82%
The fire in your eyes burns me
through and through.

373
00:32:00.208 --> 00:32:04.375 line:82%
So don't look at me like that.
My senses come crashing through.

374
00:32:05.125 --> 00:32:08.417 line:82%
If my heart loses it's self control...

375
00:32:09.667 --> 00:32:13.402 line:82%
...there'll be no end
to the rock and roll.

376
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.708 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

377
00:32:18.583 --> 00:32:22.292 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

378
00:32:22.958 --> 00:32:27.333 line:82%
Don't stand so close to me.
I feel a lot of fear.

379
00:32:27.875 --> 00:32:32.000 line:82%
With every word you say,
I can sense that love is near.

380
00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:36.527 line:82%
Don't stand so close to me.
I feel a lot of fear.

381
00:32:37.125 --> 00:32:40.833 line:82%
With every word you say,
I can sense that love is near.

382
00:32:41.917 --> 00:32:45.583 line:82%
If my heart loses it's self control...

383
00:32:46.583 --> 00:32:50.133 line:82%
...there'll be no end
to the rock and roll.

384
00:32:50.875 --> 00:32:54.375 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

385
00:32:55.542 --> 00:32:59.167 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

386
00:33:18.667 --> 00:33:20.333 line:82%
O Baby!

387
00:33:20.969 --> 00:33:22.876 line:82%
O Baby!

388
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.139 line:82%
O Baby!

389
00:33:27.917 --> 00:33:36.279 line:82%
I'm drawn to you.
I just can't help it.

390
00:33:41.667 --> 00:33:45.862 line:82%
Between our swaying bodies,
let there be some distance.

391
00:33:46.375 --> 00:33:50.457 line:82%
This crazy heart of mine
now only wants romance.

392
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.667 line:82%
If my heart loses
it's self control...

393
00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:59.430 line:82%
...there'll be no end
to the rock and roll.

394
00:34:00.167 --> 00:34:03.875 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

395
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.647 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

396
00:34:20.917 --> 00:34:22.042 line:82%
My love!

397
00:34:25.583 --> 00:34:26.583 line:82%
My love!

398
00:34:30.167 --> 00:34:31.208 line:82%
My charm!

399
00:34:34.792 --> 00:34:35.833 line:82%
My charm!

400
00:34:39.417 --> 00:34:43.621 line:82%
We must both resist
the temptation we can dare.

401
00:34:44.042 --> 00:34:48.246 line:82%
Let's hold back a little,
love is in the air.

402
00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:57.476 line:82%
Deep in my heart
there's a kind of burning.

403
00:34:57.833 --> 00:35:01.992 line:82%
Can't say no to love,
my mind keeps on turning.

404
00:35:02.792 --> 00:35:06.598 line:82%
If my heart loses
it's self control...

405
00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:10.928 line:82%
...there'll be no end
to the rock and roll.

406
00:35:11.708 --> 00:35:15.683 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

407
00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:20.222 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

408
00:35:20.958 --> 00:35:25.042 line:82%
The fire in your eyes burns me
through and through.

409
00:35:25.583 --> 00:35:29.750 line:82%
So don't look at me like that.
My senses come crashing through.

410
00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:34.375 line:82%
Don't stand so close to me.
I feel a lot of fear.

411
00:35:34.792 --> 00:35:39.042 line:82%
With every word you say,
I can sense that love is near.

412
00:35:39.708 --> 00:35:43.375 line:82%
If my heart loses
it's self control...

413
00:35:44.292 --> 00:35:47.913 line:82%
...there'll be no end
to the rock and roll.

414
00:35:48.542 --> 00:35:54.500 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

415
00:35:55.458 --> 00:35:59.208 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

416
00:36:00.183 --> 00:36:03.836 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

417
00:36:04.787 --> 00:36:08.336 line:82%
Touch me. Don't touch me, my love.

418
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.542 line:82%
Dhoom.

419
00:36:56.539 --> 00:36:59.257 line:82%
JEWELS OF THE TAJ.
AN EXHIBITION.

420
00:37:05.417 --> 00:37:06.833 line:82%
Dhoom.

421
00:37:26.542 --> 00:37:29.333 line:82%
- All cameras working, Samar?
- Yes, ma'am! - Good.

422
00:37:31.167 --> 00:37:32.375 line:82%
Go there.

423
00:37:41.417 --> 00:37:44.958 line:82%
Two snipers on that roof.
All escape routes blocked.

424
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.942 line:82%
And what if he doesn't show up?

425
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.458 line:82%
Jai, you said that in Mumbai,
there are only...

426
00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:55.779 line:82%
...two places he can strike and
we have both the places covered.

427
00:38:01.083 --> 00:38:01.833 line:82%
Hello.

428
00:38:02.083 --> 00:38:04.167 line:82%
- Fried Bombay duck or spicy clams?
- What?

429
00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:06.125 line:82%
You must have had tea
at the Taj Mahal hotel...

430
00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:07.875 line:82%
...but you wouldn't
have tried the fried...

431
00:38:08.083 --> 00:38:10.292 line:82%
...Bombay duck at Basheer's
restaurant. Hmm, best!

432
00:38:10.708 --> 00:38:13.042 line:82%
After lunch we will have some dessert.

433
00:38:13.292 --> 00:38:14.875 line:82%
You can go for ice-cream
if you want.

434
00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:17.708 line:82%
Basheer is my friend so
he won't charge extra...

435
00:38:18.083 --> 00:38:20.042 line:82%
...but remember one thing, Sho.

436
00:38:20.792 --> 00:38:26.500 line:82%
Please don't let Mr. Grumpy
know our plan, alright?

437
00:38:27.083 --> 00:38:30.750 line:82%
Come quick, I'm waiting
for you. I'm starving.

438
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.250 line:82%
You need to get kicked, right?

439
00:38:35.917 --> 00:38:37.958 line:82%
Hey mummy! At least you
should give me a warning.

440
00:38:38.542 --> 00:38:42.417 line:82%
You're on duty, not on a picnic.

441
00:38:42.917 --> 00:38:44.375 line:82%
The thief is not going to ask you.

442
00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:46.708 line:82%
Brother Ali, are you done
with your lunch? Can I rob now?

443
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.792 line:82%
And anyways the robbery is
not going...

444
00:38:49.042 --> 00:38:50.958 line:82%
...to happen here or you
wouldn't have sent me here.

445
00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:54.500 line:82%
I know you don't think
very highly of me.

446
00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:56.414 line:82%
Shut up and stay alert! Ok?

447
00:38:57.875 --> 00:38:59.625 line:82%
Can I grab some snacks
from the corner?

448
00:38:59.875 --> 00:39:00.708 line:82%
Quick!

449
00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:07.647 line:82%
What's the matter Jai?

450
00:39:09.417 --> 00:39:14.000 line:82%
I don't know, Sho,
but... something is wrong.

451
00:39:15.125 --> 00:39:16.900 line:82%
I can just feel it!

452
00:39:19.042 --> 00:39:22.375 line:82%
Come on, Mr. A. Where are you?

453
00:39:22.765 --> 00:39:24.652 line:82%
MUMBAI ART MUSEUM.

454
00:39:25.833 --> 00:39:29.097 line:82%
Come in, unit one.
Everything ok on your side?

455
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.006 line:82%
All right. Report to me.

456
00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:16.375 line:82%
Dhoom.

457
00:40:20.917 --> 00:40:22.484 line:82%
Dhoom.

458
00:40:34.458 --> 00:40:37.708 line:82%
Look, there is no need for
explanation. Follow my orders.

459
00:40:38.083 --> 00:40:39.875 line:82%
Do as I have told you.

460
00:40:40.458 --> 00:40:43.084 line:82%
No! No! No! Follow the briefing
I gave you.

461
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.333 line:82%
Ok? And Unit number 2.
Please come in.

462
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.061 line:82%
Listen. I want you to check
all the exit points. Ok. Yes.

463
00:40:56.083 --> 00:40:58.789 line:82%
And see to it that every
guard is in his place.

464
00:40:59.208 --> 00:41:01.000 line:82%
All right? Over.

465
00:41:23.958 --> 00:41:24.535 line:82%
Dhoom.

466
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:46.042 line:82%
Dhoom again the way with me.

467
00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:51.875 line:82%
Dhoom again the way with me.

468
00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:05.674 line:82%
It's beautiful, isn't it?

469
00:42:07.875 --> 00:42:08.917 line:82%
Right.

470
00:42:10.833 --> 00:42:13.042 line:82%
But I've heard the owner
was even more beautiful.

471
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.792 line:82%
Oh absolutely!

472
00:42:15.042 --> 00:42:16.375 line:82%
And she had a temper too.

473
00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:20.250 line:82%
They say that one day
she was so upset with...

474
00:42:20.667 --> 00:42:24.375 line:82%
...Shahjahan that she threw it away...

475
00:42:24.958 --> 00:42:31.015 line:82%
... and she chucked it so hard,
the central piece went missing.

476
00:42:41.708 --> 00:42:43.238 line:82%
Sho, he's not going to come here.

477
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.750 line:82%
He robs things that are perfect
and this necklace is damaged.

478
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.833 line:82%
- He's not coming, let's go!
- You go Jai.

479
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.167 line:82%
What if you're wrong? Someone
should be here to welcome him.

480
00:43:03.792 --> 00:43:06.042 line:82%
Ali, the robbery's going to happen
at the museum. Get there! Quick!

481
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:07.681 line:82%
Oh my God! I'm on my way!

482
00:43:15.833 --> 00:43:17.208 line:82%
Ali, where have you reached?

483
00:43:17.417 --> 00:43:19.083 line:82%
- Close the gate!
- Yes, sir.

484
00:43:20.417 --> 00:43:22.317 line:82%
Secure all the exit points and
report to me every 5 minutes.

485
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:23.042 line:82%
Okay.

486
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.236 line:82%
Dhoom.

487
00:43:31.458 --> 00:43:33.167 line:82%
- Sorry uncle.
- Who are you saying sorry to?

488
00:43:33.333 --> 00:43:37.458 line:82%
I banged into an old man, a cleaner.
You drive me nuts, man!

489
00:43:37.833 --> 00:43:38.917 line:82%
- Stop him!
- What?

490
00:43:39.208 --> 00:43:40.375 line:82%
Stop him now!

491
00:43:40.792 --> 00:43:41.866 line:82%
But he's just a cleaner.

492
00:43:42.083 --> 00:43:43.625 line:82%
I cancelled the shift
for the cleaning staff!

493
00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:45.208 line:82%
He shouldn't be there!

494
00:43:49.333 --> 00:43:50.172 line:82%
Stop! Police!

495
00:43:52.042 --> 00:43:53.292 line:82%
Shoot him, knee cap!
Come on, fast!

496
00:43:55.667 --> 00:43:56.479 line:82%
I said stop him!

497
00:43:57.083 --> 00:43:58.417 line:82%
Stop, uncle!

498
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:01.402 line:82%
He has stopped.

499
00:44:01.642 --> 00:44:03.458 line:82%
Check his I.D. and hold him.
I'm just getting there.

500
00:44:06.792 --> 00:44:09.500 line:82%
I would have shot you.
Why didn't you stop?

501
00:44:10.375 --> 00:44:11.125 line:82%
What?

502
00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:14.708 line:82%
Put on a hearing aid.
You could have lost your life.

503
00:44:15.292 --> 00:44:20.500 line:82%
Yes. I have a slight
hearing problem, son.

504
00:44:21.333 --> 00:44:23.417 line:82%
You should stop when a cop says so.

505
00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:25.958 line:82%
Now, what are you doing here?
Your shift was cancelled.

506
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:33.500 line:82%
At this age,
I forget my name sometimes.

507
00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:36.667 line:82%
How do you expect me
to remember shifts?

508
00:44:36.917 --> 00:44:38.708 line:82%
Come on, show me your I-Card.

509
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:40.000 line:82%
What?

510
00:44:40.208 --> 00:44:42.000 line:82%
I-card, dear, I-card.

511
00:44:56.648 --> 00:44:57.969 line:82%
MUMBAI ART MUSEUM. CLEANER.

512
00:44:58.917 --> 00:45:00.117 line:82%
What's your name?

513
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.292 line:82%
It's written behind.

514
00:45:05.142 --> 00:45:06.459 line:82%
A!

515
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:12.292 line:82%
- Where did he go?
- Where did he go?

516
00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:17.333 line:82%
Oh my God! He has fooled us!

517
00:45:21.042 --> 00:45:22.125 line:82%
Do you know how to swim?

518
00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:29.042 line:82%
Create excitement.

519
00:45:30.583 --> 00:45:31.708 line:82%
Open the gate!

520
00:45:47.917 --> 00:45:49.375 line:82%
Create excitement.

521
00:46:09.917 --> 00:46:11.792 line:82%
Hey, look at him.

522
00:46:16.125 --> 00:46:17.708 line:82%
Oh God. Where did he go?

523
00:46:28.917 --> 00:46:30.125 line:82%
Once again.

524
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.958 line:82%
Once again, Dhoom.

525
00:46:46.584 --> 00:46:48.092 line:82%
MAGNETIC FIELD ACTIVATED.

526
00:48:33.875 --> 00:48:35.042 line:82%
Ali. Come in.

527
00:48:35.667 --> 00:48:37.333 line:82%
He is among the crowd.
North Block.

528
00:48:37.583 --> 00:48:38.500 line:82%
Ok, brother Jai.

529
00:48:52.333 --> 00:48:53.523 line:82%
Dhoom.

530
00:49:00.583 --> 00:49:02.083 line:82%
Let's greet it.

531
00:49:02.875 --> 00:49:06.292 line:82%
Shall we seek it?
Keep up the spirit.

532
00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:09.000 line:82%
Let it go. Let it go.

533
00:49:10.042 --> 00:49:11.500 line:82%
Let's greet it.

534
00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:13.750 line:82%
Shall we seek it?

535
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.799 line:82%
I'm leaving town. I am resigning.

536
00:49:28.792 --> 00:49:31.382 line:82%
Great! The thief and you,
both are leaving town.

537
00:49:31.958 --> 00:49:34.629 line:82%
Very similar, you guys. Interesting.

538
00:49:36.583 --> 00:49:39.792 line:82%
Jai, I was there instead of you,
chasing him.

539
00:49:40.042 --> 00:49:41.167 line:82%
What if?

540
00:49:42.125 --> 00:49:43.333 line:82%
Mauser 9mm:

541
00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:46.083 line:82%
Bullet speed: Three thousand
feet per second.

542
00:49:46.833 --> 00:49:49.417 line:82%
A man can never run away from it.

543
00:49:50.542 --> 00:49:55.583 line:82%
Shonali, my job is to catch thieves,
not to kill them.

544
00:49:56.167 --> 00:49:58.833 line:82%
One thief dead, is one thief less.

545
00:50:00.542 --> 00:50:04.621 line:82%
Power lies here, not in there.

546
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:07.667 line:82%
We are wasting our time
standing and talking here.

547
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.983 line:82%
Mr. A must be leaving the city.

548
00:50:14.208 --> 00:50:15.250 line:82%
Dhoom.

549
00:50:15.875 --> 00:50:18.458 line:82%
Excuse me, ma'am. This is my ticket.
I'm on the waiting list...

550
00:50:18.708 --> 00:50:20.042 line:82%
Sorry, but the flight is full.

551
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.750 line:82%
Ma'am, tomorrow is my tennis match.

552
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.375 line:82%
Listen, I have to go today.

553
00:50:24.667 --> 00:50:26.917 line:82%
Excuse me, I said,
the flight's full.

554
00:50:27.167 --> 00:50:28.667 line:82%
If there is any cancellation,
I will let you know.

555
00:50:28.917 --> 00:50:30.995 line:82%
Now please, go and sit there.

556
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:36.026 line:82%
You're wasting your time.

557
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.333 line:82%
Father, if God existed,
I would have been on this flight.

558
00:50:40.208 --> 00:50:42.723 line:82%
For the last three years,
I've been winning the championship.

559
00:50:43.417 --> 00:50:44.810 line:82%
God knows that.

560
00:50:45.875 --> 00:50:48.333 line:82%
And now someone else
will take my place.

561
00:50:48.625 --> 00:50:50.750 line:82%
'After robbing a rare diamond
worth three millions...

562
00:50:50.958 --> 00:50:52.583 line:82%
...what is the thief planning next?'

563
00:50:52.792 --> 00:50:56.208 line:82%
'May the not say,
but we are telling you.'

564
00:50:59.708 --> 00:51:00.417 line:82%
TV!

565
00:51:00.625 --> 00:51:02.833 line:82%
Just a few minutes ago,
Mr. A called our news desk...

566
00:51:03.083 --> 00:51:06.125 line:82%
...and informed us of his next
robbery at the Junagarh Palace...

567
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.208 line:82%
...and that he will rob
the 600 year...

568
00:51:08.542 --> 00:51:10.625 line:82%
...old antique sword
in the next 24 hours.

569
00:51:10.917 --> 00:51:15.417 line:82%
Before the phone could be
traced he disconnected it.

570
00:51:15.792 --> 00:51:18.065 line:82%
I must say, Mr. A's got style.

571
00:51:18.458 --> 00:51:20.250 line:82%
I suggest we strike a deal
with him and settle things off...

572
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.167 line:82%
...because we won't be able to
catch him for sure. Ali to say!

573
00:51:22.417 --> 00:51:26.583 line:82%
Will the police nab him
after this information?

574
00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:28.995 line:82%
There's only one champion,
remember.

575
00:51:29.516 --> 00:51:32.655 line:82%
No one can take his place.

576
00:51:37.375 --> 00:51:38.250 line:82%
Not even God!

577
00:51:38.667 --> 00:51:40.125 line:82%
Create excitement.

578
00:51:42.417 --> 00:51:43.750 line:82%
Let's greet it.

579
00:51:44.708 --> 00:51:47.958 line:82%
Shall we seek it?
Keep up the spirit.

580
00:51:48.292 --> 00:51:50.917 line:82%
Create excitement.

581
00:51:51.132 --> 00:51:53.414 line:82%
Create excitement.

582
00:52:06.583 --> 00:52:08.417 line:82%
I want cover on all the four corners.

583
00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:09.958 line:82%
Yes, sir.

584
00:52:30.042 --> 00:52:32.682 line:82%
Sometimes it goes off
by itself, you know?

585
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.419 line:82%
Means you'll just kill me?

586
00:52:39.792 --> 00:52:42.937 line:82%
If you really want to sleep,
why not forever?

587
00:52:44.417 --> 00:52:45.542 line:82%
Joke!

588
00:52:46.083 --> 00:52:48.872 line:82%
You can't do anything
about the thief.

589
00:52:50.042 --> 00:52:52.292 line:82%
If he slips off from our hands
in day time, catching him...

590
00:52:52.542 --> 00:52:57.083 line:82%
...at night is next to impossible.
And anyways Sho...

591
00:52:57.625 --> 00:52:59.349 line:82%
...I doubt if he's going to
show up here.

592
00:52:59.625 --> 00:53:02.625 line:82%
He must be robbing
someplace else for sure.

593
00:53:04.333 --> 00:53:08.333 line:82%
If he comes here, he's never
going to leave. That I promise.

594
00:53:09.417 --> 00:53:12.980 line:82%
If he's Mr. A, he will
come here for sure.

595
00:53:13.667 --> 00:53:16.083 line:82%
But how?

596
00:53:22.847 --> 00:53:23.641 line:82%
WINCH 6000.

597
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.020 line:82%
Dhoom.

598
00:54:02.583 --> 00:54:04.417 line:82%
Dhoom.

599
00:54:09.292 --> 00:54:11.446 line:82%
One's an original, the other isn't.

600
00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:16.688 line:82%
But it's difficult
to see that, isn't it?

601
00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:31.528 line:82%
Well it was tough to get here...

602
00:54:33.292 --> 00:54:35.125 line:82%
...but from here on,
it only gets tougher.

603
00:54:35.375 --> 00:54:36.333 line:82%
No!

604
00:54:38.292 --> 00:54:40.326 line:82%
Don't even think about it!

605
00:54:57.292 --> 00:55:00.809 line:82%
Yes, infra-red beams.

606
00:55:02.875 --> 00:55:04.625 line:82%
If anything crosses
those beams, an alarm...

607
00:55:04.917 --> 00:55:07.566 line:82%
...comes on and the guards
will be here in 30 seconds.

608
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:12.375 line:82%
See the pillars?

609
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.530 line:82%
Electromagnetic stunners.

610
00:55:15.917 --> 00:55:17.417 line:82%
I love this so much!

611
00:55:17.875 --> 00:55:19.500 line:82%
They're quite deadly...

612
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.708 line:82%
...as soon as you lift the sword...
a strong current...

613
00:55:24.417 --> 00:55:26.956 line:82%
...of 2000 volts will shoot out...

614
00:55:28.542 --> 00:55:32.075 line:82%
...you'll land up either
in jail or in hospital.

615
00:55:35.292 --> 00:55:36.208 line:82%
May I?

616
00:55:42.792 --> 00:55:43.906 line:82%
Confused?

617
00:55:48.375 --> 00:55:49.962 line:82%
How will it be stolen?

618
00:55:52.125 --> 00:55:53.428 line:82%
Shall I tell?

619
00:56:01.042 --> 00:56:03.125 line:82%
The fake one for you...

620
00:56:06.417 --> 00:56:08.667 line:82%
...and this one, for me.

621
00:56:30.417 --> 00:56:32.083 line:82%
Go for the sword, when I say so.

622
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.936 line:82%
A!

623
00:56:47.167 --> 00:56:49.078 line:82%
You shouldn't have done that.

624
00:56:52.458 --> 00:56:54.449 line:82%
Now I'm going to have to come
after you.

625
00:57:21.917 --> 00:57:23.083 line:82%
Stop!

626
00:57:24.958 --> 00:57:26.917 line:82%
Jai. I got him.

627
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.125 line:82%
Create excitement.

628
00:57:46.875 --> 00:57:48.667 line:82%
Create excitement.

629
00:58:05.167 --> 00:58:07.542 line:82%
What's this, mummy! One
thief was tough to handle and...

630
00:58:07.875 --> 00:58:12.355 line:82%
...you sent another one!
Now we've had it!

631
00:58:13.542 --> 00:58:14.470 line:82%
Sorry!

632
00:58:40.875 --> 00:58:42.792 line:82%
'Sexy lady on the floor.'

633
00:58:43.542 --> 00:58:45.500 line:82%
'Keeps you coming back for more.'

634
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.500 line:82%
I am so hot!

635
00:58:51.875 --> 00:58:53.292 line:82%
Don't you feel hot in all this?

636
00:58:53.583 --> 00:58:54.875 line:82%
Are you like...

637
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:03.708 line:82%
'Sexy lady on the floor.'

638
00:59:04.417 --> 00:59:06.375 line:82%
'Keeps you coming back for more.'

639
00:59:06.875 --> 00:59:08.917 line:82%
'Sexy lady on the floor.'

640
00:59:09.542 --> 00:59:11.625 line:82%
'Keeps you coming back for more.'

641
00:59:17.833 --> 00:59:19.792 line:82%
Are you like... checking me out?

642
00:59:22.875 --> 00:59:26.250 line:82%
Behind your mask, I hope not.

643
00:59:27.083 --> 00:59:30.333 line:82%
Because if you are,
then you've had it.

644
00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:32.958 line:82%
And you'll have a lot to regret.

645
00:59:37.042 --> 00:59:38.661 line:82%
You won't be able to walk...

646
00:59:38.917 --> 00:59:40.917 line:82%
And your job needs
some running around.

647
00:59:41.292 --> 00:59:43.792 line:82%
Is there a reason for using
my name for the robbery?

648
00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:48.125 line:82%
You! You are the reason.
You're the best!

649
00:59:48.458 --> 00:59:50.333 line:82%
I mean, besides me no
one else would admit it...

650
00:59:50.583 --> 00:59:52.542 line:82%
...but Sunehri. No, not at all.

651
00:59:52.917 --> 00:59:55.542 line:82%
Sunehri's a fan of yours.
Like forever.

652
00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:59.625 line:82%
But you know who the next best is?
- Sunehri.

653
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.167 line:82%
Ok, Su - neh - ri. The Golden Girl!
Who lives in Bombay...

654
01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:08.458 line:82%
...but thinks of Amsterdam,
Australia. America even.

655
01:00:10.042 --> 01:00:11.542 line:82%
Let's hear what Sunehri thinks.

656
01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:15.333 line:82%
Do you play cricket? I mean...

657
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.208 line:82%
Who are the best opening
batsmen in the world?

658
01:00:17.458 --> 01:00:19.958 line:82%
Not Saeed Anwar, Aamir Sohail,
not Hayden or Gilchrist.

659
01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:23.542 line:82%
- Tendulkar, Sehwag.
- Funny guy!

660
01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:27.625 line:82%
Not just diamonds. Like...
you read thoughts as well.

661
01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.417 line:82%
Cool! Anyways.

662
01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:33.042 line:82%
I have a motto.

663
01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:37.333 line:82%
Less talk, more work. So tell me,
when do we start?

664
01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:40.404 line:82%
Start?

665
01:00:40.659 --> 01:00:43.292 line:82%
You and me, Tendulkar, Sehwag.
Partners.

666
01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:46.583 line:82%
Together we can be quite a team.

667
01:00:48.417 --> 01:00:51.396 line:82%
Thank you. But I'm better off alone.

668
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.917 line:82%
Everybody needs a partner
in this world.

669
01:00:57.708 --> 01:00:59.565 line:82%
Some day even you'll need one.

670
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.819 line:82%
And this is a golden chance.

671
01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:07.500 line:82%
Golden! Sunehra means golden.
Get it?

672
01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:17.168 line:82%
You've seen my work.
I'm really good.

673
01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:19.583 line:82%
Come on...

674
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.292 line:82%
...take me.

675
01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:25.125 line:82%
I am a worthy thing, trust me.

676
01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:32.370 line:82%
I don't trust anyone.

677
01:01:37.833 --> 01:01:39.682 line:82%
In principle...

678
01:01:41.542 --> 01:01:46.042 line:82%
...you robbed using my name.
So, the loot's mine too.

679
01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:50.250 line:82%
Funny guy!

680
01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:56.292 line:82%
You can keep the sword.
It's a gift from me to you.

681
01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:59.101 line:82%
But then, think about it.

682
01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:05.125 line:82%
Today a sword, tomorrow
it could be a diamond.

683
01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:07.833 line:82%
Last chance.

684
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:11.542 line:82%
Pull off the mask shake hands.

685
01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:13.374 line:82%
Like partners.

686
01:02:19.208 --> 01:02:23.169 line:82%
You're good at what you do,
so I'll give you some advice.

687
01:02:25.292 --> 01:02:27.458 line:82%
Thieves shouldn't have partners.

688
01:02:28.583 --> 01:02:31.229 line:82%
Stay alone, you'll stay alive...

689
01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:36.424 line:82%
...because if you're alone there's
no chance of getting betrayed.

690
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:39.917 line:82%
Not even by your own self.

691
01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:50.458 line:82%
She is sexy.

692
01:02:53.125 --> 01:02:54.917 line:82%
You are the man.

693
01:02:59.667 --> 01:03:01.375 line:82%
Sexy lady on the floor.

694
01:03:02.292 --> 01:03:04.125 line:82%
Keeps you coming back for more.

695
01:03:04.792 --> 01:03:06.792 line:82%
Sexy lady on the floor.

696
01:03:07.542 --> 01:03:09.306 line:82%
Keeps you coming back for more.

697
01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:19.625 line:82%
Slowly and slyly
you've stolen my heart.

698
01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:24.708 line:82%
Slowly and slyly
you've stolen my heart.

699
01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:29.517 line:82%
You weave the magic of
your love around me.

700
01:03:32.167 --> 01:03:36.583 line:82%
I dream through the day,
think of you all the way.

701
01:03:37.375 --> 01:03:38.458 line:82%
Memories of you.

702
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.000 line:82%
Thoughts of you make...

703
01:03:40.292 --> 01:03:42.083 line:82%
...my heart spin crazily.

704
01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:44.333 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

705
01:03:45.542 --> 01:03:46.875 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

706
01:03:48.163 --> 01:03:49.288 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

707
01:03:49.629 --> 01:03:52.095 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

708
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.610 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

709
01:03:56.191 --> 01:03:57.429 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

710
01:03:58.597 --> 01:03:59.795 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

711
01:04:00.106 --> 01:04:02.312 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

712
01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:28.436 line:82%
He knows it not.

713
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:31.321 line:82%
I don't let it show.

714
01:04:32.417 --> 01:04:36.500 line:82%
I've fallen for him.
Just let him know.

715
01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:39.083 line:82%
He knows it not.

716
01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:41.792 line:82%
I don't let it show.

717
01:04:42.917 --> 01:04:45.083 line:82%
I've fallen for him.

718
01:04:45.542 --> 01:04:47.208 line:82%
Somebody please let him know.

719
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.375 line:82%
This love, I slowly accede.

720
01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:54.000 line:82%
The waiting that must precede...

721
01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:56.792 line:82%
...in my love for you.

722
01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:58.667 line:82%
My heart spins crazily.

723
01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:01.250 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

724
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.792 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

725
01:05:05.116 --> 01:05:06.386 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

726
01:05:07.752 --> 01:05:09.081 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

727
01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:36.458 line:82%
'With the rhythm of
the night. Baby. Baby.'

728
01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:41.583 line:82%
'Moving out through
the night. Crazy. Crazy.'

729
01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:47.042 line:82%
'With the rhythm of
the night. Baby. Baby.'

730
01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:52.042 line:82%
'Moving out through
the night. Crazy. Crazy.'

731
01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.250 line:82%
I went from here.

732
01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.000 line:82%
All the way to there.

733
01:05:59.792 --> 01:06:02.000 line:82%
Can't get you out of my head.

734
01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.292 line:82%
Here, there and everywhere.

735
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.583 line:82%
I went from here.

736
01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:09.458 line:82%
All the way to there.

737
01:06:10.208 --> 01:06:12.375 line:82%
Can't get you out of my head.

738
01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:14.708 line:82%
Here, there and everywhere.

739
01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:18.958 line:82%
Be it dusk or be it dawn.

740
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.458 line:82%
Thoughts of you just turn me on.

741
01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:24.167 line:82%
Everything about you makes...

742
01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:26.417 line:82%
...my heart spin crazily.

743
01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:28.750 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

744
01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:31.250 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

745
01:06:32.534 --> 01:06:33.801 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

746
01:06:35.112 --> 01:06:36.608 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

747
01:06:37.458 --> 01:06:41.667 line:82%
Sexy lady on the floor.
Keeps you coming back for more.

748
01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:46.958 line:82%
Slowly and slyly
you've stolen my heart.

749
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.125 line:82%
Slowly and slyly
you've stolen my heart.

750
01:06:54.042 --> 01:06:57.083 line:82%
You weave the magic of
your love around me.

751
01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:03.875 line:82%
I dream through the day,
think of you all the way.

752
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:05.917 line:82%
Memories of you.

753
01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:07.417 line:82%
Thoughts of you make...

754
01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:09.292 line:82%
...my heart spin crazily.

755
01:07:10.333 --> 01:07:11.833 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

756
01:07:12.958 --> 01:07:14.417 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

757
01:07:15.577 --> 01:07:16.913 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

758
01:07:18.214 --> 01:07:19.691 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

759
01:07:20.752 --> 01:07:21.949 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

760
01:07:23.375 --> 01:07:24.782 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

761
01:07:25.998 --> 01:07:27.284 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

762
01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:30.312 line:82%
You drive me crazy.

763
01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:36.465 line:82%
Hey! Are you like...
checking me out?

764
01:08:41.958 --> 01:08:43.750 line:82%
Same dialogue. Tendulkar, you?

765
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.375 line:82%
From what I've heard, you leave
town after every robbery.

766
01:08:56.859 --> 01:08:58.250 line:82%
What made you stay back this time?

767
01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:02.375 line:82%
Wanted to find out
for myself whether...

768
01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:04.375 line:82%
...you imitate me in basketball too.

769
01:09:17.458 --> 01:09:19.458 line:82%
Less talk, more work.

770
01:09:34.708 --> 01:09:37.042 line:82%
Not bad... for a girl.

771
01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:39.667 line:82%
Oh no.

772
01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:43.792 line:82%
Sunehri was wrong about you...

773
01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:47.042 line:82%
...thought you were
not like other boys.

774
01:09:47.333 --> 01:09:50.000 line:82%
But... all boys are the same.

775
01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:51.792 line:82%
Funny guys.

776
01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:55.537 line:82%
Know a lot of boys?

777
01:09:57.708 --> 01:09:58.667 line:82%
Jealous?

778
01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:03.000 line:82%
Yes. I know that look.

779
01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:06.125 line:82%
You were going to say
something but you forgot.

780
01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:13.042 line:82%
It's not your fault. Sunehri has
that effect on people.

781
01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:17.792 line:82%
I think you're forgetting something.

782
01:10:19.042 --> 01:10:20.042 line:82%
What?

783
01:10:22.759 --> 01:10:23.773 line:82%
The game's not over!

784
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.292 line:82%
- Had enough?
- No way!

785
01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:49.125 line:82%
Funny guy.

786
01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:52.958 line:82%
You're not a bad player
so I'll give you some advice.

787
01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:57.125 line:82%
Get yourself a partner
if you want to go a long way.

788
01:12:19.542 --> 01:12:21.083 line:82%
This is an international
game Sunehri.

789
01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:26.095 line:82%
You need to play it with
your head, not with the heart.

790
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:31.038 line:82%
Continue like this,
you'll be right here forever.

791
01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:34.958 line:82%
Not Amsterdam. Not Australia...

792
01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:37.958 line:82%
...and definitely not America!

793
01:12:38.375 --> 01:12:40.958 line:82%
With a teacher like you,
Sunehri will learn everything.

794
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.204 line:82%
Think again. You are not
just going to be my partner.

795
01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.500 line:82%
You'll have to be my shadow.

796
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.275 line:82%
And you'll never be able to leave.

797
01:13:00.917 --> 01:13:02.199 line:82%
What happened?

798
01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:06.208 line:82%
Nothing to say?

799
01:13:06.708 --> 01:13:11.208 line:82%
Shadows don't speak.
They just follow. Silently.

800
01:13:18.417 --> 01:13:19.417 line:82%
Silent?

801
01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:22.417 line:82%
You?

802
01:13:24.875 --> 01:13:26.493 line:82%
This one I have got to see.

803
01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:33.125 line:82%
- Hey! What do I call you?
- Funny guy!

804
01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:50.000 line:82%
Jai you shouldn't have...

805
01:13:50.625 --> 01:13:51.556 line:82%
Surprise!

806
01:13:54.083 --> 01:13:56.042 line:82%
It's me Ali and flowers for you.

807
01:13:56.292 --> 01:13:58.792 line:82%
A fool is as different from
a flower as you are from Jai.

808
01:13:59.042 --> 01:14:02.292 line:82%
Let me tell you something, Sho.
Just forget about Jai.

809
01:14:02.625 --> 01:14:05.375 line:82%
Jai is in deep trouble and
whatever he said about...

810
01:14:05.625 --> 01:14:07.542 line:82%
...the thief was all wrong
but I had my doubts.

811
01:14:07.833 --> 01:14:09.833 line:82%
I always knew
they were two of them.

812
01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:13.125 line:82%
We had thieves like these
back home, Bheem and Nadeem.

813
01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:16.292 line:82%
One would steal from the back pocket
and the other from the front.

814
01:14:16.833 --> 01:14:19.208 line:82%
- What is the point?
- Point noted to be.

815
01:14:19.667 --> 01:14:21.917 line:82%
Now we have two thieves
so we need two honest officers.

816
01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:24.333 line:82%
Very honest.

817
01:14:25.583 --> 01:14:27.125 line:82%
You and me.

818
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:28.750 line:82%
And what about Jai?

819
01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:33.875 line:82%
Jai's future is not looking
too good. You got injured.

820
01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.250 line:82%
The thief got away. What else?

821
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.000 line:82%
Jai has to be suspended.

822
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:37.967 line:82%
Where's Jai?

823
01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.083 line:82%
He's taken Sweetie
to the gynecologist.

824
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.000 line:82%
She's going to have a baby.
Do you want to have a baby too?

825
01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:48.458 line:82%
Mummy! No! No baby!

826
01:15:01.958 --> 01:15:04.708 line:82%
You're always late!

827
01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:07.625 line:82%
Why are you... like always early?

828
01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:12.958 line:82%
I like to see things from the start,
whether it's a film or a robbery.

829
01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:15.715 line:82%
Any more information?

830
01:15:16.833 --> 01:15:19.792 line:82%
Why don't you ask him yourself?
He is coming here.

831
01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:22.833 line:82%
I am sure. If you speak to him
sweetly, he'll tell you everything.

832
01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:25.961 line:82%
6 months ago a girl was
about to get arrested...

833
01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:29.292 line:82%
...but she was spared
because she pleaded with...

834
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.375 line:82%
...a kind police officer
for forgiveness.

835
01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:35.900 line:82%
'Sir please, I will do anything
to help the police...

836
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:39.292 line:82%
...but I don't want to go to jail.

837
01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:42.706 line:82%
I am working on it. What else
do you want me to do?

838
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.779 line:82%
And I am good.

839
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:50.375 line:82%
He's taken me on as a partner.
Now you can arrest him.

840
01:15:52.167 --> 01:15:53.833 line:82%
For taking you on as a partner?

841
01:15:56.125 --> 01:15:58.750 line:82%
Don't try to use your intelligence.
You don't have much.

842
01:15:59.083 --> 01:16:01.833 line:82%
Now remember, we can
only arrest him when...

843
01:16:02.042 --> 01:16:06.708 line:82%
...he's committing the robbery.
Not before nor after.

844
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:13.125 line:82%
And what if he finds out that
Sunehri is working for you?

845
01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:18.542 line:82%
The end. He'll kill you.

846
01:16:21.167 --> 01:16:24.292 line:82%
There is always that gap
between a thief and a cop...

847
01:16:25.083 --> 01:16:27.542 line:82%
...and you bridge that gap.

848
01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:31.889 line:82%
Right. That's where I'm stuck.

849
01:16:47.292 --> 01:16:48.667 line:82%
How's the film, Sehwag?

850
01:16:52.667 --> 01:16:54.833 line:82%
You've changed your
appearance again.

851
01:16:55.833 --> 01:16:58.125 line:82%
Sunehri can never recognize you.

852
01:16:59.625 --> 01:17:02.792 line:82%
I'm known for my work
and not for how I look.

853
01:17:05.208 --> 01:17:07.917 line:82%
And I am on a holiday,
so don't worry.

854
01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:10.375 line:82%
I know you.

855
01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.167 line:82%
Popcorn?

856
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.458 line:82%
After the interval you'll
take a taxi to the airport.

857
01:17:25.042 --> 01:17:27.292 line:82%
There's a ticket and a passport
in your popcorn packet.

858
01:17:28.685 --> 01:17:29.666 line:82%
Passport?

859
01:17:31.833 --> 01:17:35.208 line:82%
I told you. It's an international game.

860
01:17:37.292 --> 01:17:38.523 line:82%
Create excitement.

861
01:17:41.131 --> 01:17:44.290 line:82%
Create excitement.

862
01:17:45.185 --> 01:17:46.211 line:82%
Let it go. Let it go.

863
01:17:46.957 --> 01:17:49.195 line:82%
Create a storm.

864
01:17:49.711 --> 01:17:51.663 line:82%
Create a storm... Once again...

865
01:17:52.028 --> 01:17:54.837 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Rio.

866
01:18:57.171 --> 01:18:58.504 line:82%
Are you sure this is the place?

867
01:18:58.754 --> 01:19:01.302 line:82%
Are you very sure
that this is the place?

868
01:19:01.754 --> 01:19:05.087 line:82%
Ali, if you ask me the
same question ten times...

869
01:19:05.337 --> 01:19:07.063 line:82%
...the answer is not going to change.

870
01:19:07.587 --> 01:19:10.171 line:82%
Sho has given me the address,
Copacabana.

871
01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:11.921 line:82%
So, it must be this.

872
01:19:12.171 --> 01:19:17.296 line:82%
She's done really well.
What a place! Cocabanana.

873
01:19:17.546 --> 01:19:18.587 line:82%
Am I right?

874
01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.379 line:82%
Since the time she's come,
life has only gotten worse...

875
01:19:22.171 --> 01:19:25.593 line:82%
...and now we have to live
with her sister.

876
01:19:26.546 --> 01:19:29.754 line:82%
I mean, we'll stay with her
but where is she?

877
01:19:31.046 --> 01:19:33.796 line:82%
We are surrounded by hot chicks.

878
01:19:35.546 --> 01:19:42.087 line:82%
Cocabanana, here I come!
Yippee! Hello to Ali! Hello, item!

879
01:19:42.421 --> 01:19:44.212 line:82%
Sho had said ask anyone
around the place.

880
01:19:44.587 --> 01:19:45.921 line:82%
Everyone knows.

881
01:19:46.379 --> 01:19:48.254 line:82%
Everyone is fine.
But who do we ask?

882
01:19:49.671 --> 01:19:51.337 line:82%
Cocabanana.

883
01:19:53.837 --> 01:19:55.507 line:82%
Can you give me the ball, please?

884
01:19:55.962 --> 01:19:58.337 line:82%
Oh my God! Is that allowed?

885
01:19:58.712 --> 01:20:00.421 line:82%
Can you give me the ball, please?

886
01:20:00.712 --> 01:20:02.462 line:82%
Should I ask the one in yellow?

887
01:20:02.712 --> 01:20:05.004 line:82%
Her swim wear matches
the color of my bike.

888
01:20:05.296 --> 01:20:08.546 line:82%
I'll ask her. Hello! Hi!

889
01:20:12.087 --> 01:20:13.462 line:82%
I want to...

890
01:20:21.379 --> 01:20:24.546 line:82%
I want to shake it,
till you drop.

891
01:20:24.921 --> 01:20:26.046 line:82%
I want to...

892
01:20:28.712 --> 01:20:31.921 line:82%
I want to shake it,
till you drop.

893
01:20:32.212 --> 01:20:35.671 line:82%
Shonali's sister, Monali Bose.

894
01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:43.496 line:82%
You knew?

895
01:20:44.671 --> 01:20:45.613 line:82%
What?

896
01:20:46.399 --> 01:20:47.509 line:82%
That there is a twin sister?

897
01:21:01.962 --> 01:21:02.879 line:82%
I want to...

898
01:21:07.337 --> 01:21:10.462 line:82%
I want to shake it,
till you drop.

899
01:21:11.087 --> 01:21:12.129 line:82%
I want to...

900
01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:17.962 line:82%
I want to shake it,
till you drop.

901
01:21:21.671 --> 01:21:25.879 line:82%
Hello, mia kaza.
How are you my darling?

902
01:21:26.254 --> 01:21:28.796 line:82%
Did you miss me?
My sweetie pumpkin?

903
01:21:33.921 --> 01:21:37.546 line:82%
I say hello to my house.
Some people find it weird.

904
01:21:37.796 --> 01:21:41.129 line:82%
Hello. You can say hi to people
you live with...

905
01:21:41.504 --> 01:21:45.485 line:82%
...so why not houses?
And I mean I live in my house.

906
01:21:46.296 --> 01:21:48.004 line:82%
What do you think? Ko liya...

907
01:21:49.796 --> 01:21:50.830 line:82%
Hello house!

908
01:21:51.837 --> 01:21:54.275 line:82%
What's up, everything ok?

909
01:21:55.671 --> 01:22:00.421 line:82%
You know in India, I do the same
thing. I say hi to my bike...

910
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:03.046 line:82%
...my toothbrush, my fridge,
I say hi to everything.

911
01:22:03.296 --> 01:22:06.662 line:82%
Oh my gosh! Really?
We are so similar!

912
01:22:07.046 --> 01:22:09.712 line:82%
But you didn't introduce me
to your house.

913
01:22:09.962 --> 01:22:11.004 line:82%
How will it recognize me?

914
01:22:11.212 --> 01:22:13.004 line:82%
Oh I'm so sorry.

915
01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:18.504 line:82%
Housie, housie, this is
Ali and this is Jai. Jai.

916
01:22:18.837 --> 01:22:22.754 line:82%
Jai, say hello.
Say, say hello, house!

917
01:22:23.504 --> 01:22:27.879 line:82%
You know guys? I love India
and Indians and you know what?

918
01:22:28.296 --> 01:22:32.517 line:82%
We all have to hangout together
because we are all Indians.

919
01:22:32.962 --> 01:22:34.629 line:82%
But there's one sad thing.

920
01:22:34.919 --> 01:22:38.212 line:82%
I know... you don't know
how to speak Hindi, right?

921
01:22:38.546 --> 01:22:40.766 line:82%
Gosh! How did you guess it?

922
01:22:41.171 --> 01:22:42.837 line:82%
Are you an astrologer or something?

923
01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:45.796 line:82%
Mechanic! He's a mechanic.

924
01:22:46.296 --> 01:22:48.708 line:82%
Have I been looking
for you or what?

925
01:22:49.254 --> 01:22:52.198 line:82%
I know I'm in demand.
Internationally...

926
01:22:52.587 --> 01:22:53.879 line:82%
Can you fix my hair dryer, please?

927
01:22:54.087 --> 01:22:55.754 line:82%
I can fix an airplane too...

928
01:22:56.004 --> 01:23:00.796 line:82%
...the one we came in had trouble.
I fixed it on the spot.

929
01:23:01.379 --> 01:23:02.712 line:82%
Manero!

930
01:23:15.837 --> 01:23:19.671 line:82%
Don't even think about it.
She doesn't know a word of Hindi...

931
01:23:20.199 --> 01:23:22.337 line:82%
...and God help your English!

932
01:23:22.962 --> 01:23:26.019 line:82%
It'll take you 20 years
just to get started.

933
01:23:26.921 --> 01:23:30.904 line:82%
So what if my English is poor?
I speak the language of love.

934
01:23:32.087 --> 01:23:37.712 line:82%
Ali, you have come here
as a cop not as a lover boy.

935
01:23:41.421 --> 01:23:43.218 line:82%
Where are the rooms?

936
01:23:45.712 --> 01:23:47.316 line:82%
Ali, get the luggage.

937
01:23:52.129 --> 01:23:54.587 line:82%
- Is he ok?
- He is a nut case.

938
01:23:55.129 --> 01:23:57.129 line:82%
You know, he doesn't seem right.

939
01:23:57.546 --> 01:23:59.837 line:82%
He is a nut case.
You know nut case?

940
01:24:00.421 --> 01:24:01.629 line:82%
- Crazy.
- Crazy.

941
01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:08.476 line:82%
Ali, you know I am so glad
you guys are staying with me.

942
01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:11.629 line:82%
You know I haven't been
to India for so long...

943
01:24:11.812 --> 01:24:13.296 line:82%
...and with you guys around...

944
01:24:13.587 --> 01:24:16.060 line:82%
...I feel closer to home.
Thank you.

945
01:24:33.962 --> 01:24:36.361 line:82%
What an emotional girl!

946
01:24:37.212 --> 01:24:41.836 line:82%
Thank you mummy,
for sending Monali!

947
01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:44.421 line:82%
Her name too has Ali in it.

948
01:24:52.166 --> 01:24:54.137 line:82%
DINNER 8 PM.

949
01:24:59.892 --> 01:25:01.386 line:82%
DINNER 8 PM.

950
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:33.421 line:82%
Not bad!

951
01:25:36.462 --> 01:25:37.214 line:82%
Dinner?

952
01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:56.112 line:82%
The food is fantastic!
Like... it's really nice.

953
01:25:57.546 --> 01:25:59.462 line:82%
Don't force yourself.

954
01:26:01.296 --> 01:26:02.671 line:82%
You want something else?

955
01:26:04.129 --> 01:26:06.962 line:82%
Do you have some regular food?

956
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:11.337 line:82%
It is very unhealthy.

957
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:14.504 line:82%
Sure!

958
01:26:26.712 --> 01:26:28.337 line:82%
You don't look like a cook.

959
01:26:28.754 --> 01:26:30.171 line:82%
You too do not look like a thief.

960
01:26:32.504 --> 01:26:34.962 line:82%
And anyway,
this is not my real face.

961
01:26:53.337 --> 01:26:57.629 line:82%
Sunehri, can I ask you something?

962
01:27:04.171 --> 01:27:05.944 line:82%
In an unknown place...

963
01:27:07.712 --> 01:27:13.171 line:82%
...with an unknown guy,
aren't you scared?

964
01:27:17.004 --> 01:27:19.465 line:82%
Sunehri might not recognize you...

965
01:27:21.046 --> 01:27:23.232 line:82%
...but she definitely knows you.

966
01:27:24.504 --> 01:27:27.546 line:82%
You can change your face but
you cannot change yourself.

967
01:27:28.046 --> 01:27:31.340 line:82%
I'm a thief. I can change myself.

968
01:27:32.587 --> 01:27:33.712 line:82%
I'm a thief too.

969
01:27:36.421 --> 01:27:38.754 line:82%
The first time we met
I just saw your eyes.

970
01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:42.090 line:82%
Even now I still know them.

971
01:27:44.254 --> 01:27:48.877 line:82%
You might be a thief
but your eyes are honest.

972
01:27:51.379 --> 01:27:54.176 line:82%
- Really?
- I could be wrong.

973
01:27:56.873 --> 01:28:03.187 line:82%
There's something
about you that tells me...

974
01:28:04.337 --> 01:28:05.921 line:82%
...you'll never harm me.

975
01:28:08.046 --> 01:28:10.262 line:82%
Sunehri trusts you.

976
01:28:12.337 --> 01:28:13.629 line:82%
I trust you.

977
01:28:20.087 --> 01:28:22.087 line:82%
Now, can I ask you something?

978
01:28:27.879 --> 01:28:29.688 line:82%
Do you trust me?

979
01:28:36.795 --> 01:28:40.218 line:82%
Enough conversation for
one night. Time to sleep.

980
01:28:41.587 --> 01:28:43.596 line:82%
Training at 6 a.m. tomorrow.

981
01:28:45.379 --> 01:28:49.545 line:82%
Yes. 6 a.m. sharp!

982
01:28:56.004 --> 01:28:57.212 line:82%
Funny guy!

983
01:29:14.712 --> 01:29:17.544 line:82%
Hello, you guys haven't
even started?

984
01:29:17.837 --> 01:29:19.712 line:82%
Come on, hot leavened bread!

985
01:29:20.004 --> 01:29:22.355 line:82%
She looks totally Indian, man!

986
01:29:22.805 --> 01:29:24.504 line:82%
Mummy would have been
thrilled to have met you.

987
01:29:24.712 --> 01:29:26.671 line:82%
Really? I would love to meet her.

988
01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:29.561 line:82%
You know? I love Indian food!
Delicious!

989
01:29:30.087 --> 01:29:32.629 line:82%
This is cottage cheese-butter
goulash, that's butter chicken...

990
01:29:33.004 --> 01:29:35.450 line:82%
...and this is my favorite...
black lentil soup.

991
01:29:35.731 --> 01:29:36.671 line:82%
Mine too.

992
01:29:37.212 --> 01:29:38.837 line:82%
How about some poison?

993
01:29:41.587 --> 01:29:42.842 line:82%
Don't you have any poison?

994
01:29:43.171 --> 01:29:44.837 line:82%
Sorry I missed something.

995
01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:48.421 line:82%
You know, I keep forgetting
your name all the time.

996
01:29:48.796 --> 01:29:52.546 line:82%
Jai. He loves the food.

997
01:29:52.879 --> 01:29:55.462 line:82%
It's just that he's not used
to traveling around the world.

998
01:29:55.962 --> 01:29:57.332 line:82%
His stomach is upset.

999
01:29:58.046 --> 01:30:00.290 line:82%
Ok, you take one more.

1000
01:30:02.212 --> 01:30:04.629 line:82%
If we have to eat
this food anymore...

1001
01:30:04.964 --> 01:30:07.921 line:82%
...then I'm surely going to the hotel
and you'll go to the hospital.

1002
01:30:08.764 --> 01:30:10.046 line:82%
Tell her this.

1003
01:30:11.922 --> 01:30:13.087 line:82%
What did he say?

1004
01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:15.629 line:82%
He's suffering.

1005
01:30:15.921 --> 01:30:19.796 line:82%
I know. You know?
I understand everything you say...

1006
01:30:20.337 --> 01:30:22.379 line:82%
...but him! I just don't get him.

1007
01:30:23.962 --> 01:30:25.879 line:82%
Is that what's called a nut case?

1008
01:30:27.212 --> 01:30:28.385 line:82%
You're too smart!

1009
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:32.894 line:82%
I'll get you two more
rolled breads. I'll be back.

1010
01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:45.653 line:82%
What are you watching?
So you're in love?

1011
01:30:47.129 --> 01:30:50.629 line:82%
No. That happened
in the morning itself.

1012
01:30:52.254 --> 01:30:56.097 line:82%
Jai, I must confess.
This is my last case.

1013
01:30:57.462 --> 01:31:00.721 line:82%
After this, I'm going to quit.

1014
01:31:02.129 --> 01:31:04.504 line:82%
Monali will find it hard
to adjust in India.

1015
01:31:04.879 --> 01:31:09.212 line:82%
We plan to have a small house here...

1016
01:31:09.462 --> 01:31:11.629 line:82%
...and live happily ever after
with our kids...

1017
01:31:11.921 --> 01:31:14.254 line:82%
Happy family, export family!

1018
01:31:19.129 --> 01:31:22.587 line:82%
Have you given Monali
the good news?

1019
01:31:23.379 --> 01:31:25.941 line:82%
No. Not now. Tomorrow.

1020
01:31:27.046 --> 01:31:29.337 line:82%
My mummy always said
that one should...

1021
01:31:29.587 --> 01:31:32.924 line:82%
...always declare one's love
in the morning. Fresh and early.

1022
01:31:56.379 --> 01:31:58.558 line:82%
Most thieves work at night.

1023
01:31:59.962 --> 01:32:02.793 line:82%
Like... bit different.

1024
01:32:38.296 --> 01:32:41.470 line:82%
From today, nothing
will be hidden from you.

1025
01:32:43.254 --> 01:32:47.004 line:82%
Neither my face, nor my name.

1026
01:32:51.462 --> 01:32:52.337 line:82%
Aryan!

1027
01:32:58.962 --> 01:33:00.587 line:82%
No one has seen
this face till date.

1028
01:33:01.379 --> 01:33:06.587 line:82%
Neither have I ever
trusted anyone so much.

1029
01:33:09.254 --> 01:33:13.087 line:82%
From now on, we live and die
for each other.

1030
01:33:18.879 --> 01:33:20.837 line:82%
Sunehri you have to
not only be my shadow...

1031
01:33:22.462 --> 01:33:24.357 line:82%
...but also my reflection.

1032
01:33:26.199 --> 01:33:30.046 line:82%
From now on, everything you
see will be through my eyes.

1033
01:33:39.879 --> 01:33:41.234 line:82%
I trust you.

1034
01:33:44.462 --> 01:33:45.889 line:82%
Do you trust me?

1035
01:33:48.337 --> 01:33:49.504 line:82%
Then jump!

1036
01:33:51.719 --> 01:33:52.671 line:82%
Jump!

1037
01:34:27.421 --> 01:34:28.917 line:82%
Funny guy!

1038
01:34:54.296 --> 01:34:55.629 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1039
01:35:03.504 --> 01:35:05.171 line:82%
My name is Ali.

1040
01:35:05.337 --> 01:35:07.171 line:82%
Please listen to me.

1041
01:35:07.379 --> 01:35:09.962 line:82%
Don't steal my heart
and then walk away from me.

1042
01:35:10.796 --> 01:35:13.504 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1043
01:35:15.171 --> 01:35:18.129 line:82%
I don't get sleep any more.

1044
01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:21.879 line:82%
I fear I may not breathe no more.

1045
01:35:22.796 --> 01:35:25.462 line:82%
In my heart you've created a furor.

1046
01:35:26.171 --> 01:35:29.046 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1047
01:35:30.046 --> 01:35:33.046 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1048
01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:36.738 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1049
01:35:37.694 --> 01:35:40.517 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1050
01:35:41.687 --> 01:35:44.090 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1051
01:36:20.824 --> 01:36:23.087 line:82%
- A man.
- What?

1052
01:36:24.004 --> 01:36:26.962 line:82%
- A simple man.
- Is it true?

1053
01:36:27.879 --> 01:36:34.927 line:82%
I don't know, sweetheart,
what's happening to me.

1054
01:36:35.754 --> 01:36:38.879 line:82%
Your magic does play its part.

1055
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:42.587 line:82%
It's driven me crazy from the start.

1056
01:36:43.296 --> 01:36:46.046 line:82%
Burning flames of passion
in my heart.

1057
01:36:46.837 --> 01:36:49.770 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1058
01:36:50.671 --> 01:36:53.421 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1059
01:36:54.513 --> 01:36:57.178 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1060
01:36:58.342 --> 01:37:01.496 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1061
01:37:02.158 --> 01:37:05.393 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1062
01:37:45.379 --> 01:37:47.671 line:82%
- You are...
- Yes.

1063
01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:51.546 line:82%
- My ultimate desire.
- Cool.

1064
01:37:52.337 --> 01:37:56.046 line:82%
I am so totally lost.

1065
01:37:56.546 --> 01:37:59.212 line:82%
So lost in your love.

1066
01:38:00.171 --> 01:38:03.296 line:82%
My heart skips a beat.

1067
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:07.087 line:82%
It cannot now retreat.

1068
01:38:07.837 --> 01:38:10.462 line:82%
Surviving the night
in itself is a feat.

1069
01:38:11.296 --> 01:38:13.879 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1070
01:38:15.129 --> 01:38:17.879 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1071
01:38:18.983 --> 01:38:22.005 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1072
01:38:22.812 --> 01:38:26.009 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1073
01:38:30.879 --> 01:38:32.504 line:82%
My name is Ali.

1074
01:38:32.796 --> 01:38:34.421 line:82%
Please listen to me.

1075
01:38:34.712 --> 01:38:37.379 line:82%
Don't steal my heart and
then walk away from me.

1076
01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:41.219 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1077
01:38:42.379 --> 01:38:45.337 line:82%
I don't get no sleep no more.

1078
01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:49.379 line:82%
I fear I may not breathe no more.

1079
01:38:50.171 --> 01:38:52.629 line:82%
In my heart you've created a furor.

1080
01:38:53.504 --> 01:38:56.421 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1081
01:38:57.379 --> 01:39:00.296 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1082
01:39:01.242 --> 01:39:04.188 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1083
01:39:05.021 --> 01:39:08.393 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1084
01:39:09.513 --> 01:39:14.637 line:82%
Excuse me to please.

1085
01:39:34.837 --> 01:39:37.034 line:82%
Excuse me. May I sit here?

1086
01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:47.296 line:82%
Sorry if I disturbed you.

1087
01:39:48.671 --> 01:39:49.712 line:82%
Indian.

1088
01:39:51.087 --> 01:39:53.046 line:82%
You don't look it.

1089
01:39:55.879 --> 01:39:56.962 line:82%
Vijay.

1090
01:39:58.421 --> 01:39:59.379 line:82%
Amit.

1091
01:40:11.421 --> 01:40:13.027 line:82%
My secret ingredient.

1092
01:40:13.712 --> 01:40:15.879 line:82%
The difference between
regular coffee and perfect coffee.

1093
01:40:16.171 --> 01:40:18.129 line:82%
You seem to be quite
a connoisseur of coffee.

1094
01:40:18.421 --> 01:40:19.879 line:82%
Is that your work too?

1095
01:40:20.337 --> 01:40:22.129 line:82%
Coins actually.

1096
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:27.171 line:82%
I collect coins.

1097
01:40:29.129 --> 01:40:32.462 line:82%
Money. You're after money.

1098
01:40:33.296 --> 01:40:34.671 line:82%
I guess you can say that!

1099
01:40:35.879 --> 01:40:37.962 line:82%
Funny. I too was thinking
about a coin.

1100
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:40.129 line:82%
Reminded me of my grandfather.

1101
01:40:40.421 --> 01:40:45.046 line:82%
He used to give me a coin
every Sunday and say, have a blast.

1102
01:40:46.504 --> 01:40:48.962 line:82%
That coin is quite
similar to this dime.

1103
01:40:49.421 --> 01:40:53.796 line:82%
Hmm... they don't make them anymore.
That's a rare coin!

1104
01:40:54.921 --> 01:40:56.591 line:82%
That's a rare grandfather!

1105
01:41:03.046 --> 01:41:04.337 line:82%
That's for you...

1106
01:41:07.337 --> 01:41:08.171 line:82%
Thank you.

1107
01:41:08.421 --> 01:41:11.546 line:82%
So... what's your obsession?

1108
01:41:12.504 --> 01:41:14.629 line:82%
Stories. I'm a writer.

1109
01:41:15.796 --> 01:41:16.962 line:82%
What kind of stories?

1110
01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:21.113 line:82%
All kinds. At this moment,
we too are a story.

1111
01:41:21.754 --> 01:41:24.462 line:82%
Two Indians, ten thousand miles
away from home.

1112
01:41:24.796 --> 01:41:26.254 line:82%
Coffee and conversation.

1113
01:41:26.504 --> 01:41:27.587 line:82%
I like it.

1114
01:41:28.879 --> 01:41:31.837 line:82%
But don't you need a heroine
for a popular story?

1115
01:41:32.546 --> 01:41:36.962 line:82%
There is one, but I don't know
where she is and what she's doing.

1116
01:41:37.204 --> 01:41:38.712 line:82%
I have no idea.

1117
01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:41.004 line:82%
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1118
01:41:44.087 --> 01:41:47.254 line:82%
I'm running late,
maybe a couple of hours.

1119
01:41:47.796 --> 01:41:49.504 line:82%
Should I come straight to the villa?

1120
01:41:49.754 --> 01:41:51.337 line:82%
Sure. I will see you there.

1121
01:41:51.671 --> 01:41:52.671 line:82%
Alright!

1122
01:41:53.546 --> 01:41:54.671 line:82%
Girls!

1123
01:41:57.671 --> 01:42:00.610 line:82%
Why are stories incomplete
without women?

1124
01:42:01.462 --> 01:42:04.296 line:82%
Life without women
is not a life at all.

1125
01:42:05.421 --> 01:42:08.712 line:82%
Everyone needs someone.

1126
01:42:09.796 --> 01:42:16.504 line:82%
Earlier I used to think differently,
but now, I agree with you.

1127
01:42:17.129 --> 01:42:18.296 line:82%
Excuse me.

1128
01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:24.421 line:82%
I've got two hours.
I can meet you now.

1129
01:42:24.712 --> 01:42:27.004 line:82%
Superb! Same place! One hour!

1130
01:42:30.046 --> 01:42:31.129 line:82%
Girls!

1131
01:42:32.799 --> 01:42:36.818 line:82%
Thank you for the coin!

1132
01:42:38.796 --> 01:42:42.296 line:82%
The next time we meet, we should
have something else to drink.

1133
01:42:43.034 --> 01:42:45.004 line:82%
If we meet, definitely.

1134
01:42:45.587 --> 01:42:46.671 line:82%
I hope so.

1135
01:42:46.962 --> 01:42:48.421 line:82%
- Cheers!
- See you.

1136
01:42:48.921 --> 01:42:50.096 line:82%
Dhoom.

1137
01:43:02.754 --> 01:43:07.800 line:82%
I can now recognize him.
I have seen his real face.

1138
01:43:10.171 --> 01:43:11.087 line:82%
Good.

1139
01:43:11.796 --> 01:43:14.613 line:82%
It takes one thief to know another.

1140
01:43:15.254 --> 01:43:20.129 line:82%
- Aryan is not just a thief.
- Aryan! Nice name.

1141
01:43:20.754 --> 01:43:22.785 line:82%
And his sun sign?

1142
01:43:28.754 --> 01:43:30.983 line:82%
Get this straight.
For me, Aryan's just a thief.

1143
01:43:31.421 --> 01:43:35.046 line:82%
And you're going to help me
nab him, right?

1144
01:43:36.796 --> 01:43:39.421 line:82%
Of course. Sunehri was just...

1145
01:43:39.837 --> 01:43:44.629 line:82%
...and anyway, you're the one who
asked me to get to know him well.

1146
01:43:44.879 --> 01:43:46.421 line:82%
Get to know him!

1147
01:43:47.296 --> 01:43:48.879 line:82%
Not get a life with him.

1148
01:43:50.212 --> 01:43:53.138 line:82%
Only you can tell me
what Aryan's up to.

1149
01:43:55.296 --> 01:43:58.332 line:82%
He's going to strike very soon.
I can sense it.

1150
01:43:59.754 --> 01:44:03.429 line:82%
So, after you've caught him,
I'll be free, right?

1151
01:44:05.504 --> 01:44:06.837 line:82%
I'll think about that later.

1152
01:44:09.504 --> 01:44:13.171 line:82%
Though he's a thief,
I can trust him.

1153
01:44:13.879 --> 01:44:16.296 line:82%
But you? I don't think so.
You are a cheat.

1154
01:44:21.046 --> 01:44:27.212 line:82%
You have to choose. A thief
you can trust or a cop you can't.

1155
01:44:30.962 --> 01:44:32.754 line:82%
Now leave. And remember.

1156
01:44:32.921 --> 01:44:35.587 line:82%
In this case, you are
Aryan's biggest weakness...

1157
01:44:36.421 --> 01:44:40.502 line:82%
...and my biggest strength.
I am counting on you.

1158
01:44:48.754 --> 01:44:53.116 line:82%
A friend betrayed me.

1159
01:44:54.546 --> 01:44:57.837 line:82%
Love betrayed me.

1160
01:44:58.754 --> 01:45:00.587 line:82%
Life, I don't trust you anymore.

1161
01:45:00.796 --> 01:45:05.504 line:82%
Brother, you've found a girl
for yourself, so I am leaving.

1162
01:45:06.671 --> 01:45:09.212 line:82%
If you drive so slowly,
I will miss my flight.

1163
01:45:10.254 --> 01:45:12.777 line:82%
- Ali.
- Ali is dead.

1164
01:45:13.962 --> 01:45:16.437 line:82%
A heart attack would
have been less painful.

1165
01:45:17.004 --> 01:45:18.629 line:82%
Ali is a fool.

1166
01:45:19.754 --> 01:45:22.962 line:82%
You were like my brother,
I'd do anything for you...

1167
01:45:23.296 --> 01:45:27.379 line:82%
...sacrifice my life for you,
but you don't respect me.

1168
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:29.421 line:82%
If I didn't respect you,
then why would I get you here?

1169
01:45:29.671 --> 01:45:31.754 line:82%
For fun, I'm a jester right?
You thought let's take Ali...

1170
01:45:31.962 --> 01:45:33.671 line:82%
...he's good fun.
He'll make us laugh.

1171
01:45:33.921 --> 01:45:35.379 line:82%
And that woman Sunehri,
she'll do all the work.

1172
01:45:35.587 --> 01:45:37.764 line:82%
Just wait and watch
what she does to you.

1173
01:45:38.087 --> 01:45:42.984 line:82%
Mr. Jai, just wait and watch,
she'll make a fool of you.

1174
01:45:43.754 --> 01:45:48.839 line:82%
Ali, I think you look nice
with a cap. You chiraou!

1175
01:45:49.421 --> 01:45:52.587 line:82%
Did you hear that?
She hardly knows me and...

1176
01:45:52.921 --> 01:45:55.712 line:82%
...yet she cares for me
and you, look what you did.

1177
01:45:56.087 --> 01:45:59.004 line:82%
- Ali, I was about to tell you.
- When? After arresting him?

1178
01:45:59.254 --> 01:46:00.629 line:82%
Or after that girl gets the medal
for catching the thief?

1179
01:46:00.879 --> 01:46:03.837 line:82%
- Ali...
- I not talk to you. Not talk I!

1180
01:46:04.212 --> 01:46:07.212 line:82%
I had a dream too. That we'll
catch the thief together.

1181
01:46:07.796 --> 01:46:10.274 line:82%
But unfortunately,
he saw your face.

1182
01:46:11.171 --> 01:46:12.879 line:82%
And if headquarters got
to know this...

1183
01:46:13.129 --> 01:46:15.099 line:82%
...they wouldn't have
allowed you to come here.

1184
01:46:15.504 --> 01:46:19.953 line:82%
I had to involve Sunehri
and save our mission.

1185
01:46:22.504 --> 01:46:26.796 line:82%
You will arrest the thief, you
will get the medal and promotion...

1186
01:46:27.671 --> 01:46:29.546 line:82%
...you will get married,
you will have kids.

1187
01:46:29.712 --> 01:46:31.393 line:82%
The whole world
will look up to you.

1188
01:46:31.754 --> 01:46:34.476 line:82%
But I think my dreams
won't come true.

1189
01:46:35.879 --> 01:46:40.254 line:82%
But dreams are just dreams.
And you are leaving...

1190
01:46:40.504 --> 01:46:46.599 line:82%
Enough. These are the dreams
you had for me?

1191
01:46:47.337 --> 01:46:52.655 line:82%
Yes. After all, you are the one
who's taught me to dream.

1192
01:46:53.962 --> 01:46:55.004 line:82%
Jai brother...

1193
01:46:55.212 --> 01:46:57.504 line:82%
Hello, guys somebody hug me too.

1194
01:46:57.641 --> 01:46:58.296 line:82%
RETORNO COPACABANA.

1195
01:46:58.581 --> 01:47:01.296 line:82%
Our friendship is forever.

1196
01:47:02.379 --> 01:47:09.129 line:82%
We'll be friends till we die.

1197
01:47:11.587 --> 01:47:12.774 line:82%
Dhoom.

1198
01:47:21.254 --> 01:47:27.159 line:82%
Nice place! Cool.
But why are we here?

1199
01:47:29.379 --> 01:47:31.171 line:82%
To rob.

1200
01:47:31.879 --> 01:47:33.754 line:82%
To rob?

1201
01:47:35.171 --> 01:47:37.302 line:82%
But here, what are we going
to rob here?

1202
01:47:40.462 --> 01:47:43.587 line:82%
Isn't this guy too small to rob?

1203
01:47:54.379 --> 01:47:55.379 line:82%
This?

1204
01:47:57.421 --> 01:47:58.421 line:82%
Why?

1205
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:03.212 line:82%
The first chapter in the history
of money.

1206
01:48:03.962 --> 01:48:05.960 line:82%
This is where it all began.

1207
01:48:06.962 --> 01:48:10.676 line:82%
The very first coins made by man.

1208
01:48:14.421 --> 01:48:15.987 line:82%
The first ever!

1209
01:48:18.296 --> 01:48:20.178 line:82%
And they are priceless!

1210
01:48:22.671 --> 01:48:25.568 line:82%
They don't cost much, I bet.

1211
01:48:26.212 --> 01:48:28.879 line:82%
I could get you these coins
on the streets of Bombay itself.

1212
01:48:29.129 --> 01:48:30.754 line:82%
We didn't have to come
all the way to Brazil...

1213
01:48:31.004 --> 01:48:32.640 line:82%
150 crores!

1214
01:48:36.379 --> 01:48:39.337 line:82%
The starting bid will be 150 crores!

1215
01:48:41.171 --> 01:48:43.175 line:82%
You can very well imagine
where it'll end.

1216
01:48:48.504 --> 01:48:50.287 line:82%
What have you decided?

1217
01:48:53.754 --> 01:48:54.796 line:82%
When?

1218
01:48:58.546 --> 01:48:59.129 line:82%
Tomorrow.

1219
01:49:28.296 --> 01:49:29.706 line:82%
Dhoom.

1220
01:49:35.254 --> 01:49:36.504 line:82%
That's quick!

1221
01:49:38.462 --> 01:49:40.293 line:82%
He's super fast.

1222
01:49:41.421 --> 01:49:43.210 line:82%
You should nab him soon.

1223
01:49:47.879 --> 01:49:49.923 line:82%
You'll be with him
during the robbery.

1224
01:49:50.671 --> 01:49:52.736 line:82%
Signal me as soon as he strikes.

1225
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:56.837 line:82%
How?

1226
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:05.254 line:82%
You just have to press this
and I will do the rest.

1227
01:50:32.254 --> 01:50:34.004 line:82%
From today we'll be like this.

1228
01:50:34.671 --> 01:50:35.962 line:82%
Hand in hand.

1229
01:50:36.837 --> 01:50:37.879 line:82%
I trust you.

1230
01:50:39.212 --> 01:50:40.046 line:82%
I trust.

1231
01:50:44.129 --> 01:50:46.025 line:82%
What are you up to?

1232
01:50:47.671 --> 01:50:50.879 line:82%
I was making coffee.

1233
01:50:51.129 --> 01:50:53.625 line:82%
Coffee. Allow me.

1234
01:50:58.254 --> 01:51:01.504 line:82%
What would you feel
if I were to die?

1235
01:51:03.129 --> 01:51:08.125 line:82%
Sorry. Stupid question.
We all have to die some day.

1236
01:51:12.337 --> 01:51:15.748 line:82%
But what if I die tomorrow?

1237
01:51:22.837 --> 01:51:26.296 line:82%
Why do you say that?

1238
01:51:27.796 --> 01:51:29.362 line:82%
You are the best!

1239
01:51:35.462 --> 01:51:37.135 line:82%
But, Sunehri the truth is that...

1240
01:51:38.796 --> 01:51:41.014 line:82%
...today for the first time
in my life...

1241
01:51:45.796 --> 01:51:47.441 line:82%
What will happen tomorrow?

1242
01:51:49.212 --> 01:51:52.066 line:82%
What do you think
will happen tomorrow?

1243
01:51:54.087 --> 01:51:55.864 line:82%
Tomorrow?

1244
01:51:57.379 --> 01:51:59.879 line:82%
Sunehri lives life one day at a time.

1245
01:52:00.129 --> 01:52:02.681 line:82%
You know, that's
what I like about you.

1246
01:52:04.462 --> 01:52:05.546 line:82%
Coffee?

1247
01:52:06.087 --> 01:52:07.254 line:82%
Really.

1248
01:52:07.546 --> 01:52:09.624 line:82%
You know I have learnt a lot
from you...

1249
01:52:10.212 --> 01:52:11.642 line:82%
...and look at me.

1250
01:52:11.962 --> 01:52:13.968 line:82%
I think too much and don't live
my life to the fullest.

1251
01:52:14.337 --> 01:52:16.879 line:82%
Think... think... think...
and look at you.

1252
01:52:17.212 --> 01:52:21.587 line:82%
That's the way to be!
What an attitude! Fantastic!

1253
01:52:23.254 --> 01:52:26.671 line:82%
So, no more boring stuff,
this coffee, this cooking.

1254
01:52:26.879 --> 01:52:29.239 line:82%
Health food, nothing safe.

1255
01:52:30.837 --> 01:52:34.879 line:82%
Now, let's live life to the fullest!

1256
01:52:37.796 --> 01:52:39.262 line:82%
So, what do you say?

1257
01:52:42.087 --> 01:52:43.222 line:82%
Let's party!

1258
01:52:48.004 --> 01:52:48.962 line:82%
Let's party!

1259
01:53:47.118 --> 01:53:49.087 line:82%
Create a storm.

1260
01:53:55.504 --> 01:53:56.231 line:82%
Dhoom.

1261
01:54:11.337 --> 01:54:14.438 line:82%
Jai Dixit! ACP, Mumbai police.

1262
01:54:15.421 --> 01:54:17.666 line:82%
Real name and real job.

1263
01:54:20.546 --> 01:54:24.762 line:82%
Aryan, my true name.
My job, I'm sure you know.

1264
01:54:27.129 --> 01:54:29.536 line:82%
Been chasing you for a long time.

1265
01:54:30.087 --> 01:54:31.895 line:82%
You've really made me run.

1266
01:54:32.796 --> 01:54:35.606 line:82%
If it's you chasing,
one has to run.

1267
01:54:37.462 --> 01:54:41.005 line:82%
And then, I like being chased.

1268
01:54:48.046 --> 01:54:49.645 line:82%
I was just wondering...

1269
01:54:50.046 --> 01:54:53.046 line:82%
...what if you give up
the idea of robbing?

1270
01:54:53.379 --> 01:54:58.329 line:82%
Bad idea! If all the thieves give up
robbing, what will cops do?

1271
01:55:00.379 --> 01:55:04.010 line:82%
Everyone needs a job
to survive, right?

1272
01:55:04.712 --> 01:55:07.629 line:82%
But what if the job kills you?
What's the use?

1273
01:55:07.837 --> 01:55:11.754 line:82%
I mean, I will really feel bad
if I have to kill you.

1274
01:55:14.504 --> 01:55:17.380 line:82%
True, I'll feel bad too
if you kill me.

1275
01:55:19.754 --> 01:55:21.234 line:82%
But if I don't get killed...

1276
01:55:25.046 --> 01:55:26.746 line:82%
...will I have to kill you?

1277
01:55:30.671 --> 01:55:34.536 line:82%
I guess you have to do your job
and I have to do mine.

1278
01:55:35.129 --> 01:55:36.712 line:82%
The funny thing is...

1279
01:55:37.129 --> 01:55:40.504 line:82%
...a man's work becomes his destiny.
And your destiny's...

1280
01:55:41.046 --> 01:55:43.451 line:82%
...not looking too good, my friend.

1281
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:47.921 line:82%
Don't be too sure of that.

1282
01:55:48.212 --> 01:55:50.027 line:82%
I like your confidence.

1283
01:55:50.546 --> 01:55:51.712 line:82%
I like you.

1284
01:55:53.129 --> 01:55:54.924 line:82%
May the best man win!

1285
01:56:00.379 --> 01:56:02.877 line:82%
And how are we going to decide that?

1286
01:56:03.546 --> 01:56:04.923 line:82%
Oh simple.

1287
01:56:06.087 --> 01:56:09.953 line:82%
We'll do what my dad always did...

1288
01:56:16.212 --> 01:56:19.546 line:82%
Your coin, but the win will be mine.

1289
01:56:19.921 --> 01:56:20.939 line:82%
Dhoom.

1290
01:56:50.296 --> 01:56:51.036 line:82%
Love.

1291
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:53.763 line:82%
Burn your heart.

1292
01:56:55.087 --> 01:56:56.004 line:82%
Love.

1293
01:56:57.379 --> 01:56:58.633 line:82%
Burn your heart.

1294
01:56:59.754 --> 01:57:03.725 line:82%
Don't ever fall in love,
It'll only give you a heartache.

1295
01:57:04.462 --> 01:57:08.587 line:82%
Giving your heart to the heartbroken
will only lead to heartbreak.

1296
01:57:09.129 --> 01:57:12.547 line:82%
Don't ever fall in love,
It'll only give you a heartache.

1297
01:57:13.879 --> 01:57:17.997 line:82%
Giving your heart to the heartbroken
will only lead to heartbreak.

1298
01:57:18.546 --> 01:57:22.754 line:82%
No one believes it,
no one knows it.

1299
01:57:23.296 --> 01:57:26.921 line:82%
But I now know that.
Love takes your life away.

1300
01:57:28.004 --> 01:57:29.921 line:82%
Dhoom, just take my life.

1301
01:57:30.337 --> 01:57:32.254 line:82%
Dhoom, just break my heart.

1302
01:57:32.671 --> 01:57:34.546 line:82%
Dhoom, just tear apart.

1303
01:57:37.379 --> 01:57:39.337 line:82%
Dhoom, just take my life.

1304
01:57:39.752 --> 01:57:41.785 line:82%
Dhoom, just break my heart.

1305
01:57:42.129 --> 01:57:44.031 line:82%
Dhoom, just tear apart.

1306
01:57:44.712 --> 01:57:47.087 line:82%
Come, take my life.

1307
01:57:49.129 --> 01:57:51.087 line:82%
- Dhoom.
- Yes, Dhoom.

1308
01:57:51.504 --> 01:57:53.462 line:82%
- Dhoom.
- Yes, Dhoom.

1309
01:57:53.878 --> 01:57:56.081 line:82%
- Dhoom.
- Yes, Dhoom.

1310
01:57:56.312 --> 01:57:57.970 line:82%
- Dhoom.
- Yes, Dhoom.

1311
01:58:08.004 --> 01:58:11.921 line:82%
Love is a gift. A gift from above.

1312
01:58:12.671 --> 01:58:16.337 line:82%
Each of us once has fallen in love.

1313
01:58:16.671 --> 01:58:19.004 line:82%
Love's an obsession.
Love's an addiction.

1314
01:58:19.421 --> 01:58:21.587 line:82%
Love is soothing. Love is joy.

1315
01:58:21.837 --> 01:58:23.879 line:82%
A call from the heart.

1316
01:58:24.129 --> 01:58:25.962 line:82%
You know this.

1317
01:58:26.212 --> 01:58:30.712 line:82%
This love is forever.
I hope it never ends.

1318
01:58:31.254 --> 01:58:35.495 line:82%
All my love is for you, sweetheart.
Believe me when I say this.

1319
01:58:36.254 --> 01:58:40.379 line:82%
No one believes it.
No one knows it.

1320
01:58:40.921 --> 01:58:44.587 line:82%
But I now know that
love takes your life away.

1321
01:58:45.629 --> 01:58:47.504 line:82%
Dhoom, just take my life.

1322
01:58:48.004 --> 01:58:49.879 line:82%
Dhoom, just break my heart.

1323
01:58:50.337 --> 01:58:52.337 line:82%
Dhoom, just tear apart.

1324
01:58:52.962 --> 01:58:54.754 line:82%
Come, take my life.

1325
01:59:35.129 --> 01:59:39.299 line:82%
Who knows? This moment
may never come again.

1326
01:59:39.754 --> 01:59:43.296 line:82%
Right here, right now.
May never come again.

1327
01:59:43.879 --> 01:59:48.504 line:82%
This love takes you higher.
This love's a desire.

1328
01:59:48.879 --> 01:59:52.837 line:82%
This love is a fire.
This love takes you far.

1329
01:59:53.212 --> 01:59:57.837 line:82%
Love starts a fire,
then puts it out.

1330
01:59:58.296 --> 02:00:02.546 line:82%
Love is loyalty, then it's a doubt.
Love is a sentence.

1331
02:00:03.296 --> 02:00:07.504 line:82%
No one believes it.
No one knows it.

1332
02:00:08.004 --> 02:00:11.629 line:82%
But I now know that
love takes your life away.

1333
02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:14.671 line:82%
Dhoom, just take my life.

1334
02:00:15.046 --> 02:00:16.962 line:82%
Dhoom, just break my heart.

1335
02:00:17.421 --> 02:00:19.379 line:82%
Dhoom, just tear apart.

1336
02:00:20.004 --> 02:00:22.296 line:82%
Come, take my life.

1337
02:00:24.462 --> 02:00:25.587 line:82%
Love.

1338
02:00:26.754 --> 02:00:28.035 line:82%
Burn your heart.

1339
02:00:29.171 --> 02:00:30.171 line:82%
Love.

1340
02:00:31.462 --> 02:00:32.697 line:82%
Burn your heart.

1341
02:00:33.879 --> 02:00:37.421 line:82%
Don't ever fall in love.
It'll only give you a heartache.

1342
02:00:38.546 --> 02:00:42.087 line:82%
Giving your heart to the heartbroken,
will only lead to heartbreak.

1343
02:00:43.254 --> 02:00:47.421 line:82%
No one believes it.
No one knows it.

1344
02:00:47.962 --> 02:00:51.758 line:82%
But I now know that
love takes your life away.

1345
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:54.587 line:82%
Dhoom, just take my life.

1346
02:00:55.087 --> 02:00:56.962 line:82%
Dhoom, just break my heart.

1347
02:00:57.379 --> 02:00:59.337 line:82%
Dhoom, just tear apart.

1348
02:01:02.171 --> 02:01:04.046 line:82%
Dhoom, just take my life.

1349
02:01:04.421 --> 02:01:06.379 line:82%
Dhoom, just break my heart.

1350
02:01:06.754 --> 02:01:08.671 line:82%
Dhoom, just tear apart.

1351
02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:11.879 line:82%
Come, take my life.

1352
02:01:13.879 --> 02:01:14.962 line:82%
Dhoom.

1353
02:01:18.546 --> 02:01:19.546 line:82%
Dhoom.

1354
02:01:38.712 --> 02:01:40.528 line:82%
What a beautiful day, Sunehri!

1355
02:01:43.254 --> 02:01:44.504 line:82%
Beautiful!

1356
02:01:49.212 --> 02:01:50.754 line:82%
It's a perfect day!

1357
02:01:52.837 --> 02:01:58.629 line:82%
It's a perfect day!
Perfect betrayal, perfect death!

1358
02:02:01.337 --> 02:02:02.171 line:82%
Just perfect!

1359
02:02:05.171 --> 02:02:09.597 line:82%
Why are you saying all this?

1360
02:02:11.087 --> 02:02:12.168 line:82%
Sorry.

1361
02:02:14.337 --> 02:02:17.462 line:82%
Do I have to take permission
to talk from Jai Dixit?

1362
02:02:20.546 --> 02:02:22.921 line:82%
Try to understand...

1363
02:02:24.254 --> 02:02:26.095 line:82%
...that's not what it is.

1364
02:02:27.546 --> 02:02:28.904 line:82%
Trust me.

1365
02:02:30.712 --> 02:02:31.689 line:82%
Okay.

1366
02:02:35.754 --> 02:02:37.802 line:82%
So then, why don't
you explain it to me.

1367
02:02:40.296 --> 02:02:45.129 line:82%
You were sent here by Jai.

1368
02:02:48.129 --> 02:02:49.915 line:82%
You were planted!

1369
02:02:52.837 --> 02:02:53.754 line:82%
Yes.

1370
02:02:54.004 --> 02:02:56.454 line:82%
And with your help Jai
would get me, right?

1371
02:03:03.629 --> 02:03:07.796 line:82%
If it were you in my place,
would you have trusted me?

1372
02:03:10.671 --> 02:03:11.757 line:82%
No.

1373
02:03:15.087 --> 02:03:18.379 line:82%
A bullet and a gun
are like partners...

1374
02:03:20.879 --> 02:03:22.800 line:82%
...and the bullet never betrays
the gun.

1375
02:03:25.296 --> 02:03:27.587 line:82%
And wherever it hits,
it takes away life.

1376
02:03:33.087 --> 02:03:34.337 line:82%
I love that.

1377
02:03:38.546 --> 02:03:43.296 line:82%
Only you have the right
to take my life Sunehri...

1378
02:03:45.712 --> 02:03:47.039 line:82%
...not Jai.

1379
02:03:49.587 --> 02:03:50.837 line:82%
So please...

1380
02:03:55.421 --> 02:03:56.962 line:82%
...do the need full.

1381
02:04:02.171 --> 02:04:04.620 line:82%
- I can't!
- You will have to.

1382
02:04:08.796 --> 02:04:11.004 line:82%
In this game of trust and betrayal,
there are rules.

1383
02:04:11.337 --> 02:04:14.329 line:82%
After every betrayal,
someone has to die.

1384
02:04:15.671 --> 02:04:17.583 line:82%
Then why not Sunehri?

1385
02:04:19.212 --> 02:04:21.837 line:82%
I'm the one who's betrayed you.

1386
02:04:23.171 --> 02:04:24.284 line:82%
You are right.

1387
02:04:38.087 --> 02:04:39.087 line:82%
Shoot!

1388
02:04:43.462 --> 02:04:46.194 line:82%
Come on, Sunehri, pick up the gun.

1389
02:04:48.504 --> 02:04:50.324 line:82%
Pick up the gun, Sunehri.

1390
02:04:53.879 --> 02:04:55.398 line:82%
I said shoot, damn it!

1391
02:05:05.004 --> 02:05:07.116 line:82%
Death too has betrayed me.

1392
02:05:32.337 --> 02:05:34.208 line:82%
Why are you doing this?

1393
02:05:35.587 --> 02:05:38.398 line:82%
Everything has an end to it.

1394
02:05:44.796 --> 02:05:46.626 line:82%
This is the result...

1395
02:05:49.296 --> 02:05:53.451 line:82%
...of what you have done.

1396
02:05:55.129 --> 02:05:57.324 line:82%
Don't make me do this.

1397
02:05:58.962 --> 02:06:00.736 line:82%
- You can't escape it.
- Please.

1398
02:06:14.879 --> 02:06:17.444 line:82%
For the first time
I am not afraid of death.

1399
02:06:20.296 --> 02:06:22.756 line:82%
Death is here, wearing your face...

1400
02:06:24.754 --> 02:06:28.254 line:82%
...then Sunehri is ok, like forever.

1401
02:06:39.587 --> 02:06:44.397 line:82%
The last bullet.
Finally, death is mine.

1402
02:06:48.921 --> 02:06:50.129 line:82%
I'm a thief Sunehri.

1403
02:06:52.193 --> 02:06:55.133 line:82%
I have changed my face many
a time to cheat this world.

1404
02:06:58.379 --> 02:07:00.213 line:82%
But you changed my whole life.

1405
02:07:02.337 --> 02:07:07.171 line:82%
It's only right if I die
in front of you.

1406
02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:14.254 line:82%
Please, don't let me down
at this stage.

1407
02:07:15.046 --> 02:07:17.150 line:82%
Sunehri would rather die...

1408
02:07:18.996 --> 02:07:20.671 line:82%
...but won't betray you.

1409
02:07:23.507 --> 02:07:24.564 line:82%
I love you.

1410
02:07:36.671 --> 02:07:38.635 line:82%
You can't take your life...

1411
02:07:41.962 --> 02:07:43.341 line:82%
...it belongs to me.

1412
02:07:45.212 --> 02:07:46.524 line:82%
I hate you!

1413
02:07:50.004 --> 02:07:51.337 line:82%
I hate you!

1414
02:07:55.379 --> 02:07:56.504 line:82%
I know!

1415
02:08:08.212 --> 02:08:09.777 line:82%
How far would you go with me?

1416
02:08:14.379 --> 02:08:15.732 line:82%
I am your shadow...

1417
02:08:18.087 --> 02:08:22.629 line:82%
...and shadows can only
follow silently.

1418
02:08:27.337 --> 02:08:32.254 line:82%
Quiet and you?

1419
02:08:39.004 --> 02:08:40.740 line:82%
This one I have got to see.

1420
02:08:51.962 --> 02:08:55.540 line:82%
Hello everyone. Welcome to our
Children's Day Special.

1421
02:09:12.379 --> 02:09:15.129 line:82%
All security arrangements
should be just like any other day.

1422
02:09:15.462 --> 02:09:17.462 line:82%
No tourists to be stopped.

1423
02:09:17.796 --> 02:09:19.504 line:82%
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Is that clear?

1424
02:09:19.796 --> 02:09:22.227 line:82%
Clear. Clear. Yes Jai, everything's
clear. Just like mineral water!

1425
02:09:26.462 --> 02:09:29.671 line:82%
C'mon, Sunehri...
bring him to meet me.

1426
02:09:47.879 --> 02:09:49.647 line:82%
Yes Jai, everything's clear.

1427
02:09:49.962 --> 02:09:52.171 line:82%
And no guns to be seen.
There are children here.

1428
02:09:52.421 --> 02:09:53.962 line:82%
All weapons are concealed.

1429
02:10:44.171 --> 02:10:45.796 line:82%
Don't run!

1430
02:10:48.296 --> 02:10:50.379 line:82%
No movement. Hold!

1431
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:55.379 line:82%
- Ali, alarm.
- Yes. - I want everything cleared.

1432
02:10:56.671 --> 02:10:57.789 line:82%
Hello. Hold.

1433
02:10:59.754 --> 02:11:01.223 line:82%
Hold. Kids.

1434
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:03.351 line:82%
A!

1435
02:11:05.712 --> 02:11:08.171 line:82%
Ali! Lock down the place!
And search everyone!

1436
02:11:08.379 --> 02:11:09.587 line:82%
Ok, Jai!

1437
02:11:11.421 --> 02:11:14.921 line:82%
Let the children go,
search all adults.

1438
02:11:15.296 --> 02:11:17.337 line:82%
- Okay.
- Okay go, move!

1439
02:11:17.692 --> 02:11:19.004 line:82%
Why is your phone off?

1440
02:11:34.087 --> 02:11:35.837 line:82%
Everyone's been searched.
Nothing at all

1441
02:11:36.129 --> 02:11:37.421 line:82%
How can that be?
Was everyone searched properly?

1442
02:11:37.629 --> 02:11:39.504 line:82%
Yes, Jai. Except the children,
everyone's been searched.

1443
02:11:40.212 --> 02:11:41.629 line:82%
Ali I told you to...

1444
02:11:47.046 --> 02:11:47.962 line:82%
Wait a minute!

1445
02:11:49.254 --> 02:11:51.131 line:82%
Didn't Snow White
have seven dwarfs?

1446
02:11:59.212 --> 02:12:00.467 line:82%
I'll look there...

1447
02:12:08.837 --> 02:12:12.004 line:82%
Brother, full house empty.
Looks like they're gone.

1448
02:12:21.754 --> 02:12:22.587 line:82%
Hello.

1449
02:12:22.754 --> 02:12:24.326 line:82%
'You had once asked me...

1450
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:27.087 line:82%
...to choose the cop or thief.'

1451
02:12:29.962 --> 02:12:31.879 line:82%
'Sunehri has made up her mind.'

1452
02:12:32.921 --> 02:12:34.501 line:82%
I'm coming for you.

1453
02:12:35.611 --> 02:12:36.921 line:82%
Find yourself a place to hide...

1454
02:12:38.421 --> 02:12:42.712 line:82%
...because once I'm done with you,
you all are done for!

1455
02:12:48.921 --> 02:12:50.921 line:82%
Now, both have had it!

1456
02:12:54.004 --> 02:12:56.046 line:82%
Dhoom, once again.

1457
02:12:56.587 --> 02:12:59.589 line:82%
Dhoom, once again.

1458
02:13:39.421 --> 02:13:40.587 line:82%
Dhoom.

1459
02:13:46.296 --> 02:13:47.240 line:82%
Dhoom.

1460
02:13:51.796 --> 02:13:53.337 line:82%
Create a storm.

1461
02:14:37.129 --> 02:14:38.754 line:82%
Dhoom, once again.

1462
02:14:49.046 --> 02:14:50.629 line:82%
Create a storm.

1463
02:14:52.671 --> 02:14:54.254 line:82%
Create a storm.

1464
02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:29.712 line:82%
He's made me crazy.

1465
02:16:31.004 --> 02:16:32.712 line:82%
He's made me crazy.

1466
02:16:49.462 --> 02:16:50.879 line:82%
Dhoom, once again.

1467
02:16:52.796 --> 02:16:54.087 line:82%
Dhoom, once again.

1468
02:17:55.837 --> 02:17:57.178 line:82%
Create a storm.

1469
02:18:22.962 --> 02:18:24.484 line:82%
Create a storm.

1470
02:20:44.587 --> 02:20:48.520 line:82%
This is the end Aryan,
let's go now.

1471
02:20:50.921 --> 02:20:52.935 line:82%
Have you ever loved someone deeply?

1472
02:20:56.587 --> 02:20:59.087 line:82%
Put your hands up,
and start walking.

1473
02:21:00.671 --> 02:21:03.379 line:82%
Can you love someone
enough to take their life?

1474
02:21:03.796 --> 02:21:05.349 line:82%
I don't care, Aryan.

1475
02:21:05.962 --> 02:21:09.759 line:82%
But if you love yourself,
then start walking.

1476
02:21:15.421 --> 02:21:20.428 line:82%
Can you love someone
enough to take their life?

1477
02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:35.259 line:82%
Why?

1478
02:22:41.421 --> 02:22:43.146 line:82%
Because I loved him.

1479
02:22:51.754 --> 02:22:53.142 line:82%
Get lost, Sunehri.

1480
02:22:55.129 --> 02:22:57.483 line:82%
Your punishment is your life.

1481
02:22:59.004 --> 02:23:02.075 line:82%
Alone, you'll never betray anyone.

1482
02:23:03.504 --> 02:23:05.235 line:82%
Not even yourself.

1483
02:23:24.463 --> 02:23:28.999 line:82%
6 MONTHS LATER. SOMEWHERE
IN THE FIJI ISLANDS.

1484
02:23:32.712 --> 02:23:37.421 line:82%
Hey Nick, here's your coke
and burger with pickles.

1485
02:23:37.712 --> 02:23:39.046 line:82%
Just the way you like it.

1486
02:23:39.254 --> 02:23:40.629 line:82%
You are amazing, Sunehri.

1487
02:23:40.879 --> 02:23:41.962 line:82%
Charles.

1488
02:23:46.962 --> 02:23:48.921 line:82%
- Enjoy.
- Hey where's my order?

1489
02:23:49.171 --> 02:23:51.671 line:82%
Chicken and vegetables coming up.

1490
02:23:54.087 --> 02:23:57.102 line:82%
What the... funny guy!

1491
02:24:00.171 --> 02:24:02.921 line:82%
Sorry ma'am, but the cook's on strike.

1492
02:24:05.546 --> 02:24:06.546 line:82%
What?

1493
02:24:07.796 --> 02:24:10.921 line:82%
My contract clearly states
that I get a kiss every half hour.

1494
02:24:12.337 --> 02:24:16.629 line:82%
It's over an hour now.
And no kiss yet. I quit!

1495
02:24:18.546 --> 02:24:23.254 line:82%
Really! I'm not that kind of girl.

1496
02:24:28.754 --> 02:24:32.504 line:82%
Well, there's just one way
to find out.

1497
02:24:33.171 --> 02:24:34.790 line:82%
And, how's that?

1498
02:24:36.046 --> 02:24:40.671 line:82%
A little bit of this
and a little bit of that!

1499
02:25:01.879 --> 02:25:02.953 line:82%
How about a beer?

1500
02:25:11.754 --> 02:25:15.087 line:82%
Can you love someone
enough to take his life?

1501
02:25:17.879 --> 02:25:19.212 line:82%
Don't think so.

1502
02:25:22.379 --> 02:25:26.087 line:82%
Because the one who
loves doesn't take life...

1503
02:25:27.171 --> 02:25:28.504 line:82%
...but sacrifices their life.

1504
02:25:30.296 --> 02:25:34.837 line:82%
That day Sunehri gift wrapped
your life in that bullet.

1505
02:25:38.046 --> 02:25:39.254 line:82%
Masterstroke!

1506
02:25:41.879 --> 02:25:45.546 line:82%
I felt bad when you were
falling off that cliff...

1507
02:25:46.712 --> 02:25:49.441 line:82%
...and I said to myself, what a guy!

1508
02:25:50.837 --> 02:25:52.594 line:82%
What a great love story!

1509
02:25:54.129 --> 02:25:57.379 line:82%
Then I thought, what crap!

1510
02:26:00.462 --> 02:26:03.430 line:82%
This story can't end this way.

1511
02:26:06.671 --> 02:26:12.546 line:82%
And that's why you set Sunehri free,
knowing that she'll lead you to me.

1512
02:26:16.546 --> 02:26:17.504 line:82%
Masterstroke!

1513
02:26:17.796 --> 02:26:21.612 line:82%
Well, thank you...
But now I'm really tired.

1514
02:26:22.962 --> 02:26:25.921 line:82%
For 6 months I've waited in this town.

1515
02:26:26.754 --> 02:26:28.983 line:82%
Waited for that next robbery.

1516
02:26:29.587 --> 02:26:31.546 line:82%
I am tired of thinking...

1517
02:26:31.962 --> 02:26:34.538 line:82%
...for the symbol of
'A' to re-appear.

1518
02:26:35.962 --> 02:26:38.311 line:82%
So I thought I'd come over
personally...

1519
02:26:38.837 --> 02:26:41.151 line:82%
...and ask you if you've
changed your signature.

1520
02:26:41.712 --> 02:26:43.296 line:82%
I have changed myself.

1521
02:26:45.754 --> 02:26:47.968 line:82%
- But I haven't.
- I know.

1522
02:26:50.504 --> 02:26:53.462 line:82%
Knew you'd come in search of us...
someday.

1523
02:26:59.629 --> 02:27:01.602 line:82%
All the information
about my robberies...

1524
02:27:02.004 --> 02:27:05.004 line:82%
...the deposit boxes,
locker numbers...

1525
02:27:05.671 --> 02:27:09.379 line:82%
...all the data is in this watch.

1526
02:27:13.087 --> 02:27:14.901 line:82%
We won't be needing it now.

1527
02:27:34.962 --> 02:27:38.129 line:82%
So, how are we going to the airport?
Or should we take our car?

1528
02:27:39.504 --> 02:27:42.421 line:82%
Excuse me. Is this place open?

1529
02:27:43.254 --> 02:27:44.296 line:82%
Of course!

1530
02:27:47.754 --> 02:27:49.893 line:82%
This place is always open.

1531
02:27:52.087 --> 02:27:57.212 line:82%
Let me tell you, that for the world,
Mr. A is dead.

1532
02:27:59.587 --> 02:28:01.129 line:82%
And there's nothing...

1533
02:28:01.379 --> 02:28:03.545 line:82%
...that great about putting dead
thieves in jail.

1534
02:28:06.962 --> 02:28:10.254 line:82%
I'm going to let you guys go,
because it's a love story.

1535
02:28:12.296 --> 02:28:15.149 line:82%
But remember, I'll be watching.

1536
02:28:17.671 --> 02:28:24.546 line:82%
The lover will die
with great and pomp.

1537
02:28:24.921 --> 02:28:26.337 line:82%
Dhoom.

1538
02:28:28.587 --> 02:28:30.202 line:82%
For the beer.

1539
02:28:31.421 --> 02:28:32.337 line:82%
So long.

1540
02:28:42.379 --> 02:28:44.242 line:82%
May I have the beers, please?

1541
02:28:48.129 --> 02:28:50.906 line:82%
Open the beers,
I am still on strike.

1542
02:28:55.004 --> 02:28:56.254 line:82%
Funny guy!

1543
02:28:58.421 --> 02:29:00.316 line:82%
- Hello.
- Curse me.

1544
02:29:01.004 --> 02:29:01.962 line:82%
What?

1545
02:29:02.405 --> 02:29:03.891 line:82%
It's been 6 months now,
that no one's cursed me.

1546
02:29:04.076 --> 02:29:04.671 line:82%
Shut up Ali!

1547
02:29:04.879 --> 02:29:08.962 line:82%
Please curse me in Hindi,
I'm missing home.

1548
02:29:09.254 --> 02:29:12.171 line:82%
Pack your bags and get back
to India right now!

1549
02:29:12.379 --> 02:29:14.067 line:82%
We've got our next case!

1550
02:29:15.504 --> 02:29:17.379 line:82%
Dhoom again and run away with me...

1551
02:29:17.629 --> 02:29:19.287 line:82%
...on a rollercoaster ride.

1552
02:29:20.254 --> 02:29:22.462 line:82%
Dhoom again and see
your wildest dreams...

1553
02:29:22.712 --> 02:29:24.253 line:82%
...slowly come alive.

1554
02:29:25.087 --> 02:29:27.004 line:82%
Dhoom again we got
to break the rules...

1555
02:29:27.254 --> 02:29:29.207 line:82%
...and party all the time.

1556
02:29:29.921 --> 02:29:31.796 line:82%
Dhoom again we got
to steal the show...

1557
02:29:32.046 --> 02:29:33.962 line:82%
...you know that isn't a crime.

1558
02:29:34.337 --> 02:29:36.462 line:82%
So steal all that you can...

1559
02:29:36.754 --> 02:29:38.837 line:82%
...the magic you began.

1560
02:29:39.171 --> 02:29:41.254 line:82%
Let's shout, break out.

1561
02:29:41.587 --> 02:29:43.962 line:82%
Come on once again, let's hear it.

1562
02:29:44.379 --> 02:29:46.462 line:82%
Create a storm.

1563
02:29:46.712 --> 02:29:49.087 line:82%
Create a storm.

1564
02:29:49.486 --> 02:29:51.994 line:82%
Create a storm.

1565
02:29:53.946 --> 02:29:58.296 line:82%
Create a storm.

1566
02:29:58.761 --> 02:30:01.489 line:82%
