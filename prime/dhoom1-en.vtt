There's nobody around us
What a wonderful moment

2
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.109 line:82%
Let me be naughty today

3
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:01.820 line:82%
We'll work tomorrow

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:12.081 line:82%
No one is around us
What a wonderful moment

5
00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:14.708 line:82%
Let me be naughty today

6
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.419 line:82%
We'll work tomorrow

7
00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:19.880 line:82%
Go away now

8
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.674 line:82%
Don't tempt me like this

9
00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.843 line:82%
Come back to your senses

10
00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:27.262 line:82%
Don't be crazy

11
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:30.265 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

12
00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:33.060 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

13
00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.354 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

14
00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:38.273 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

15
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:27.239 line:82%
The windows are asking me
To draw the curtains

16
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:32.703 line:82%
Don't punish me like this

17
00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:38.000 line:82%
Let go of me
Let me go

18
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:43.213 line:82%
Will you swear
Not to be so stubborn?

19
00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.175 line:82%
How is this a bad thing?

20
00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:48.635 line:82%
Why are you being so evasive?

21
00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:53.640 line:82%
I know how crazy you are

22
00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.310 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

23
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.354 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

Darling, let's dance

26
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.232 line:82%
Don't tempt me with your smile

27
00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:48.278 line:82%
Come into my arms and kiss me

28
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:53.617 line:82%
All right, I give up

29
00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:59.081 line:82%
Your wish is my command

30
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:04.419 line:82%
Don't waste time just talking

31
00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:09.132 line:82%
Come, let's lose ourselves in one another

32
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.094 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:14.888 line:82%

Darling, let's dance

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.893 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

36
00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:30.654 line:82%
There's nobody around us
What a wonderful moment

We'll work tomorrow

39
00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.537 line:82%
Go away now

40
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.206 line:82%
Don't tempt me like this

41
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.375 line:82%
Come back to your senses

42
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.752 line:82%
Don't be crazy

43
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.006 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

44
00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.258 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.969 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

Darling, let's dance

00:09:56.722 --> 00:09:59.099 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.893 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:04.604 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

50
00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.982 line:82%
Darling, let's dance

51
00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:14.573 line:82%
Hello?

52
00:10:16.742 --> 00:10:17.784 line:82%
Yes, speaking.

53
00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.246 line:82%
Yes, tell me.

54
00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.083 line:82%
What?

55
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.085 line:82%
When?

56
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.006 line:82%
Okay, I'll be there.

57
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:38.764 line:82%
Stupid idiot!

58
00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:41.516 line:82%
Always working!

59
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.809 line:82%
Never bothering with me!

60
00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:44.770 line:82%
Well, I won't bother anymore either.
Don't come back home!

61
00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:47.439 line:82%
Just see what will
happen if you come back.

62
00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.275 line:82%
I'm reporting from Mumbai's Marine Drive,

63
00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:53.528 line:82%
where a Safeguard Securities van
was ambushed and robbed.

64
00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:57.866 line:82%
It's being said that this was caused
by a four-member biker gang

65
00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.827 line:82%
who have allegedly pulled off
heists like this before.

66
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:03.455 line:82%
Where?

67
00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:06.541 line:82%
There.

68
00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:07.793 line:82%
What's there?

69
00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:10.796 line:82%
Are you from the media?

70
00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:13.715 line:82%
Are you a mechanic?

71
00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:16.551 line:82%
Police.

72
00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:20.847 line:82%
Yes, the police are already here.
They've barricaded the area.

73
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.933 line:82%
ACP Jai Dixit.

74
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.477 line:82%
He is coming tomorrow.
Come and meet him tomorrow.

75
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.395 line:82%
ACP Jai Dixit.

76
00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:31.817 line:82%
There were four bikes, sir.
All imported ones.

77
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:37.489 line:82%
A police patrol vehicle
was at the intersection.

78
00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:41.493 line:82%
There was a problem with
the traffic lights.

79
00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:43.954 line:82%
They're still not working.

80
00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:45.997 line:82%
Signal...

81
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.916 line:82%
Yes?

82
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.670 line:82%
Get a computer expert to check it out.

83
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.132 line:82%
Someone from the gang must have
tampered with it.

84
00:11:56.258 --> 00:12:00.804 line:82%
It's not difficult. There's a small chip
and anyone can change the settings.

85
00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:05.684 line:82%
Sir, I have only heard of you till today.

86
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:11.690 line:82%
But today... Sir, I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you.

87
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.942 line:82%
You'll identify the thieves right?

88
00:12:16.987 --> 00:12:19.656 line:82%
Who rides bikes like these?

89
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:23.910 line:82%
Find one of them...

90
00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:26.246 line:82%
and you will find the rest of them.

91
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.569 line:82%
Where's Ali?

92
00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.821 line:82%
Must be somewhere in the back.

93
00:13:26.932 --> 00:13:28.016 line:82%
Hey, old man.

94
00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.392 line:82%
-Yes?
-Bet 500 for me.

95
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.811 line:82%
-On Sunny?
-No, on Ali.

96
00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.648 line:82%
You'll lose your money, kid.

97
00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:39.629 line:82%
You've broken all records today, Ali!

98
00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:42.340 line:82%
We don't make as much money
even when we sell a bike!

99
00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:45.969 line:82%
Tonight's party is going to be amazing!

100
00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.596 line:82%
Yes, of course.

101
00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:53.602 line:82%
What's wrong with me?

102
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.563 line:82%
Why don't the ladies look at me?

103
00:14:56.688 --> 00:15:00.984 line:82%
They're just the sisters
of the guys who lost.

104
00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.613 line:82%
My luck is rotten.
God has given me everything,

105
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.449 line:82%
except some luck with the ladies.

106
00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:10.285 line:82%
I want to be a family man someday.

107
00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:11.453 line:82%
I understand.

108
00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.123 line:82%
Mommy, are you listening?

109
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:16.875 line:82%
Ali?

110
00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:37.896 line:82%
Ali?

111
00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:41.316 line:82%
You are Ali, right?

112
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.568 line:82%
Looks like God has granted your wish.

113
00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.403 line:82%
No, it's my mother.

114
00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:51.826 line:82%
I'm Ali.

115
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.829 line:82%
Hi, I'm a big fan.

116
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.250 line:82%
You ride so well!
I just think you are great.

117
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.377 line:82%
Mention not.

118
00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.506 line:82%
I heard that you also sell bikes.

119
00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.008 line:82%
-You want a bike?
-Yes.

120
00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:14.265 line:82%
Why do you need a bike.
I have mine, right?

121
00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:17.268 line:82%
We can ride on my bike.

122
00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.855 line:82%
No, I want to buy the bike for Polly.

123
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.484 line:82%
Polly who? Your sister?

124
00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:29.531 line:82%
You've got a great sense of humor, no.
Polly is my boyfriend.

125
00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:42.210 line:82%
Ali, don't lose hope.

126
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.378 line:82%
No, don't.

127
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:46.673 line:82%
Someday you'll definitely meet someone.

128
00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:48.091 line:82%
Yes, yes, you'll find her.

129
00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.510 line:82%
Not someday, I want a girlfriend now.

130
00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:54.681 line:82%
Mommy, make arrangements in a day or two.

131
00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:56.057 line:82%
No, you decide right now.

132
00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:57.684 line:82%
Is your job more important or your wife?

133
00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.649 line:82%
Have lunch on time
or else you'll get heartburn.

134
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.401 line:82%
I've made bread stuffed with radishes.

135
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.279 line:82%
I've also packed yogurt.

136
00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.697 line:82%
It's for you and not the others.

137
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.075 line:82%
I put so much effort into your meals
and you don't even get to eat properly.

138
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.244 line:82%
-Bye, baby.
-Listen.

139
00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:20.290 line:82%
Come home early. I'll make bread
stuffed with cauliflower.

140
00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:22.625 line:82%
Listen.

141
00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.473 line:82%
What is this, Sweety?

142
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.893 line:82%
My sweet baby, bye.

143
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.570 line:82%
What do you think of yourself?

144
00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.823 line:82%
People like you should be jailed.

145
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.784 line:82%
You should be sentenced to life,
only then you will improve.

146
00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:56.701 line:82%
What?

147
00:17:56.785 --> 00:18:00.789 line:82%
If I had not stopped you,
you would have run him over.

148
00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.041 line:82%
But he isn't hurt, right?

149
00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.084 line:82%
What if he got hurt?
What would you have done?

150
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.297 line:82%
Just because you didn't run him over,
doesn't mean it will never happen.

151
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.674 line:82%
Okay, I made a mistake. What do we do now?

152
00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.551 line:82%
-Apologize to him.
-What?

153
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:18.389 line:82%
If you were about to run over a man,
you would apologize, right?

154
00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.725 line:82%
She's right. You must apologize.

155
00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.145 line:82%
-Sorry.
-Hello?

156
00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.982 line:82%
-Did anyone hear anything?
-No!

157
00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:32.445 line:82%
-Say it with a little love.
-Of course.

158
00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:38.326 line:82%
Sorry.

159
00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:40.703 line:82%
He doesn't accept your apology.

160
00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:42.956 line:82%
Someone save him!

161
00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.792 line:82%
Mr. Puppy, wait.

162
00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.136 line:82%
What are you staring at, darling?

163
00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.850 line:82%
As long as I'm around,
nothing will happen to you.

164
00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:05.228 line:82%
Don't be afraid. I'm a vet, sweetheart.

165
00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.358 line:82%
Come, darling. Come, come.

166
00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.822 line:82%
How are you feeling?

167
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.159 line:82%
-What's your name?
-Ali.

168
00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:24.539 line:82%
You're very brave. You saved his life.

169
00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:25.748 line:82%
-His?
-Yes.

170
00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:29.419 line:82%
-You had an accident and--
-Stop.

171
00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.006 line:82%
Please don't be so formal.

172
00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.050 line:82%
How sweet.

173
00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:39.888 line:82%
You wait here.
I'll get you something to eat.

174
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.806 line:82%
-What?
-Carrot souffle.

175
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:45.602 line:82%
Carrot souffle? She is the sweetest.

176
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.689 line:82%
-What is your name?
-Sweety.

177
00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.900 line:82%
What a lovely name.

178
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.113 line:82%
Thank you, Mommy.

179
00:19:58.364 --> 00:19:59.991 line:82%
You've found me such a beautiful girl.

180
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:05.038 line:82%
Now it's just Sweety, the puppy and me.

181
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.999 line:82%
Small family, happy family.

182
00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.542 line:82%
-Who's there?
-I'll get it.

183
00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.052 line:82%
Yes?

184
00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:28.019 line:82%
Jai, meet Ali. Ali, this is Jai.

185
00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:29.228 line:82%
My husband.

186
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.452 line:82%
Why do these things only happen to me?

187
00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.873 line:82%
-Who have you brought home?
-Darling!

188
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:53.419 line:82%
Darling? You call him that?

189
00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:55.755 line:82%
He's so cute, Jai.

190
00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:57.757 line:82%
Poor thing was lying on the street.

191
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:02.804 line:82%
Sweety...

192
00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:06.265 line:82%
I've put up with all kinds of animals
for your sake.

193
00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:10.269 line:82%
I never expected you to bring home
a full grown man.

194
00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:11.813 line:82%
Man?

195
00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:18.778 line:82%
Oh, no, no. He's not Darling.

196
00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:21.155 line:82%
Darling is the puppy's name.
The other guy is Ali.

197
00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.199 line:82%
What do you think? Yes or no?

198
00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:26.577 line:82%
Hello.

199
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.667 line:82%
You live on the streets
or do you work to make a living?

200
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:36.295 line:82%
I'm like an engineer.
I have my own garage.

201
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.049 line:82%
Everyone in Bandra knows Ali.

202
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.011 line:82%
Ali, this is for you.

203
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:47.724 line:82%
Whenever you feel like eating
carrot souffle, come over.

204
00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:49.892 line:82%
-Promise?
-Promise.

205
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.148 line:82%
-You want the container back?
-Bring it next time.

206
00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:03.114 line:82%
Okay, Darling, I'll leave now.

207
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:10.246 line:82%
-Poor thing.
-Poor thing?

208
00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:13.624 line:82%
This guy looks like a thief.

209
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:18.046 line:82%
God! Will you ever change?

210
00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:20.298 line:82%
You're always suspicious.

211
00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:23.134 line:82%
It's not right. I keep telling you.

212
00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:44.781 line:82%
-He is?
-Ali, sir.

213
00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:46.282 line:82%
Owns a garage in Bandra.

214
00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:47.867 line:82%
He rides fast bikes.

215
00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:52.288 line:82%
He's the suspect? Are you sure?

216
00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.582 line:82%
I'm sure, sir.
I've been following him for two days.

217
00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:57.210 line:82%
He also fences stolen bikes.

218
00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:00.630 line:82%
I'm sure he belongs to the same gang.

219
00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:15.061 line:82%
Ali's Bike Point, Bandra Lane.

220
00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:19.774 line:82%
Red CBR Fireblade, MH02BN3203.

221
00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:24.112 line:82%
Blue CBR, MH04BN1234.

222
00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:26.447 line:82%
Who's there?

223
00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:30.159 line:82%
-Ali.
-Yes.

224
00:23:30.493 --> 00:23:32.203 line:82%
-How are you?
-Good and you?

225
00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:37.875 line:82%
Sweety has sent carrot souffle for you.

226
00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:44.674 line:82%
Hey, Vinod, bring two special teas.

227
00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:46.801 line:82%
Nice.

228
00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:51.764 line:82%
You're fond of bikes?

229
00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:52.974 line:82%
Fond?

230
00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:56.352 line:82%
Ali tweaks them and makes them better
than the original.

231
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.270 line:82%
Really?

232
00:23:57.353 --> 00:24:01.315 line:82%
Yes, that's why he's famous
all over Mumbai.

233
00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:03.192 line:82%
You never told him all this?

234
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:04.819 line:82%
Shut up, punk.

235
00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:07.280 line:82%
Always blabbing.

236
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:13.411 line:82%
You must also be into riding bikes right?

237
00:24:13.661 --> 00:24:16.873 line:82%
Ride? Ali flies the bike.

238
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.835 line:82%
His bikes fly in the air.

239
00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:23.462 line:82%
He won a race two days ago on this bike.

240
00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:25.715 line:82%
He was two miles ahead of everyone else.

241
00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:34.599 line:82%
You mean to say this bike is faster
than the other bikes?

242
00:24:34.682 --> 00:24:38.227 line:82%
Only if Ali is the one riding it.

243
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:39.145 line:82%
Can I?

244
00:24:46.152 --> 00:24:49.238 line:82%
-Are you also interested in bikes?
-Yes, of course.

245
00:24:49.322 --> 00:24:53.659 line:82%
I've been thinking of buying
a fast, racing bike for a while.

246
00:24:54.911 --> 00:24:57.538 line:82%
Sweety also loves bikes.

247
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.003 line:82%
You want to buy one?

248
00:25:06.005 --> 00:25:10.051 line:82%
I want a new bike. Fast.

249
00:25:11.552 --> 00:25:12.678 line:82%
Fast like this one.

250
00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:16.766 line:82%
You'll get one but without the documents.
Is that all right?

251
00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:19.018 line:82%
No documents, as in?

252
00:25:19.644 --> 00:25:21.062 line:82%
Do you want to ride the bike
or the documents?

253
00:25:21.395 --> 00:25:22.563 line:82%
Documentation will take two minutes.

254
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:26.859 line:82%
Where can we find a bike like that?

255
00:25:26.943 --> 00:25:29.195 line:82%
You'll find it here.
You can get everything here.

256
00:25:29.278 --> 00:25:30.821 line:82%
Rafik, are you all right?

257
00:25:30.905 --> 00:25:33.199 line:82%
You're new, right?
That's why you don't know.

258
00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:35.117 line:82%
This market is called Chor Bazaar.

259
00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:37.286 line:82%
This place is more famous than me.

260
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:38.412 line:82%
Move, guys!

261
00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:51.550 line:82%
-Stay here and be quiet.
-Why?

262
00:25:53.135 --> 00:25:54.887 line:82%
Everyone is a bit hot-headed here.

263
00:25:55.805 --> 00:25:59.809 line:82%
Don't say anything, don't do anything.
It's not safe.

264
00:26:00.142 --> 00:26:01.185 line:82%
And you?

265
00:26:01.978 --> 00:26:04.647 line:82%
I have my contacts.

266
00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:08.567 line:82%
They're not afraid of the police?

267
00:26:10.528 --> 00:26:12.029 line:82%
The police are afraid of them.

268
00:26:12.947 --> 00:26:15.992 line:82%
Policemen don't make it out of here alive.

269
00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:20.329 line:82%
Are you scared? Don't worry.

270
00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:22.456 line:82%
You just stand here for a while,

271
00:26:22.707 --> 00:26:25.001 line:82%
nothing will happen to you.
I'll be back soon.

272
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.357 line:82%
What is it, smart ass? Are you blind?

273
00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:51.986 line:82%
What are you staring at?

274
00:26:52.069 --> 00:26:55.406 line:82%
Eyes down. Down, I said.

275
00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:57.658 line:82%
Don't piss me off.

276
00:26:57.867 --> 00:27:00.494 line:82%
One slap and you'll fly ten feet away.

277
00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:02.830 line:82%
Do it.

278
00:27:02.913 --> 00:27:05.541 line:82%
What did you say? Say it again.

279
00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:07.585 line:82%
Slap me.

280
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.338 line:82%
He has gone mad.

281
00:27:10.713 --> 00:27:11.964 line:82%
Doesn't know who he's up against.

282
00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:24.894 line:82%
Let him get beaten up a little,
then I'll save him.

283
00:27:48.542 --> 00:27:53.506 line:82%
Remember that you've raised your hands
to Anwar Hatela.

284
00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:55.966 line:82%
If you're a man, wait here.

285
00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.345 line:82%
I'll cut you into pieces right now.

286
00:28:14.235 --> 00:28:15.194 line:82%
Run.

287
00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:16.237 line:82%
What?

288
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.405 line:82%
Run.

289
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.162 line:82%
Run!

290
00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:07.932 line:82%
-Are you in Shetty's gang?
-Who?

291
00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:10.518 line:82%
Manchekar? Rodriguez? Billu?

292
00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:14.271 line:82%
-Whose gang do you work for?
-Police gang.

293
00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:17.733 line:82%
Police and you? You beat him up so much!

294
00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:21.570 line:82%
You hit him once and he fell down.
Policemen aren't this fit.

295
00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:24.823 line:82%
Why? Ever messed with cops?

296
00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:28.118 line:82%
My whole life has been
trying to evade the police.

297
00:30:28.994 --> 00:30:31.997 line:82%
A man can be anything except a policeman.

298
00:30:33.958 --> 00:30:37.253 line:82%
Tell me something.
How come you like bikes?

299
00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:40.798 line:82%
Tell me the truth. You don't want to
do a heist, do you?

300
00:30:42.258 --> 00:30:44.134 line:82%
No. I'm scared of the police.

301
00:30:44.218 --> 00:30:46.637 line:82%
Cops? Don't worry about them.

302
00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:49.598 line:82%
Even if I was on a bicycle,
they couldn't catch up.

303
00:30:49.682 --> 00:30:52.810 line:82%
Is that so? You have that much confidence
in yourself?

304
00:30:53.686 --> 00:30:54.979 line:82%
I have confidence in the police.

305
00:30:55.229 --> 00:30:57.773 line:82%
The thief is right in front of them
and still they do nothing.

306
00:30:58.315 --> 00:30:59.733 line:82%
They're all stupid.

307
00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:05.239 line:82%
What can I say? They're so stupid.

308
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.783 line:82%
How can I tell you how stupid they are?

309
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:10.744 line:82%
-Go inside here.
-It's a lot of fun, I swear.

310
00:31:10.828 --> 00:31:14.373 line:82%
Once I conned a policeman,
what can I even tell you.

311
00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:18.002 line:82%
You beat those guys up so well.

312
00:31:18.085 --> 00:31:19.086 line:82%
I'll give you that.

313
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.629 line:82%
Pull over.

314
00:31:28.137 --> 00:31:29.263 line:82%
What is this place?

315
00:31:30.347 --> 00:31:31.473 line:82%
This is where I work.

316
00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:38.897 line:82%
You're a cop?

317
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.234 line:82%
No, I'm a hit man.

318
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.580 line:82%
-Write.
-What?

319
00:31:56.373 --> 00:31:57.833 line:82%
How long you've been stealing for,

320
00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:01.128 line:82%
where you've kept all the money,
names of your accomplices, etc.

321
00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:04.506 line:82%
I was suspicious of you
from the beginning.

322
00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:07.801 line:82%
I saved your life and this is how
you repay me?

323
00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:11.388 line:82%
We're both short of time.

324
00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:13.682 line:82%
Quickly admit to your crimes.

325
00:32:15.059 --> 00:32:17.269 line:82%
I'll try and get you a shorter sentence.

326
00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:20.648 line:82%
Sir, something is wrong with you.
I am not a thief.

327
00:32:21.315 --> 00:32:24.360 line:82%
Look, I'm asking you nicely.

328
00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:27.029 line:82%
Tell me what your plan is.

329
00:32:27.404 --> 00:32:28.781 line:82%
Who is in your gang?

330
00:32:29.156 --> 00:32:31.867 line:82%
My gang consists of Chotu, Vinod
and Munna. That's it.

331
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.994 line:82%
Vinod is new. He doesn't even know
how to ride a bike.

332
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:35.954 line:82%
How could I pull off a heist like this?

333
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.582 line:82%
Look, if you keep harassing me
like this...

334
00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:40.209 line:82%
Why are you taking off your glasses?

335
00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:43.087 line:82%
Stop him. Don't do anything you shouldn't.

336
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.797 line:82%
Stop talking on the phone.

337
00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:48.384 line:82%
Hey, Ali.
Look, you're testing my patience.

338
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:51.303 line:82%
What is your plan
and where is the next robbery?

339
00:32:51.387 --> 00:32:52.846 line:82%
I have no clue, sir!

340
00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:54.139 line:82%
Sir...

341
00:32:55.557 --> 00:32:58.102 line:82%
-Where is the next robbery?
-It's already happened.

342
00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:00.062 line:82%
-Next robbery?
-It has happened.

343
00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:00.979 line:82%
What?

344
00:33:01.605 --> 00:33:04.066 line:82%
A robbery has taken place
a while ago, in Andheri.

345
00:34:09.339 --> 00:34:12.426 line:82%
He's on Western Express Highway.
Stop him at the check point.

346
00:35:40.848 --> 00:35:42.558 line:82%
Welcome to Pizza Place.

347
00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:44.059 line:82%
What will you have?

348
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:49.982 line:82%
Good evening, sir.

349
00:35:59.116 --> 00:36:01.827 line:82%
What do you think, Jai? Any clues?

350
00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:09.293 line:82%
Sir, they knew where the cameras were
and where the cops were positioned

351
00:36:09.376 --> 00:36:11.211 line:82%
and what our reaction time would be.

352
00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:14.006 line:82%
They left no clues.

353
00:36:16.425 --> 00:36:18.552 line:82%
Jai, what's going on?

354
00:36:19.428 --> 00:36:21.054 line:82%
I mean, this is too much.

355
00:36:21.972 --> 00:36:25.559 line:82%
Robberies in broad daylight
and the robbers escaping with no trace.

356
00:36:26.268 --> 00:36:27.895 line:82%
It's so embarrassing.

357
00:36:30.564 --> 00:36:34.276 line:82%
-I think we're making a mistake.
-What?

358
00:36:36.612 --> 00:36:38.488 line:82%
All this while we've been thinking
like policemen.

359
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.742 line:82%
We have to think like thieves now.

360
00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:46.622 line:82%
If they're smart,
we'll have to be smarter.

361
00:36:48.123 --> 00:36:49.458 line:82%
They escape on fast bikes.

362
00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.881 line:82%
-We need bikes to get to them.
-But, our riders are already...

363
00:36:56.173 --> 00:36:57.341 line:82%
Not our men.

364
00:36:58.133 --> 00:36:59.927 line:82%
-Someone else.
-Who?

365
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:08.894 line:82%
-Jai hit you?
-Who else?

366
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:13.440 line:82%
I'll tell you one more thing.
Please don't mind.

367
00:37:13.941 --> 00:37:16.652 line:82%
He's a policeman, but a goon at heart.

368
00:37:16.735 --> 00:37:19.655 line:82%
-He terrorizes people.
-Don't you worry.

369
00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:21.573 line:82%
Let him come, I'll set him straight.

370
00:37:21.657 --> 00:37:24.159 line:82%
No, no. If I'm here,
he'll beat me up again.

371
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.787 line:82%
If he hits me any more,
I'll lose my face value.

372
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.997 line:82%
This is my house! Not some police station.

373
00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:30.916 line:82%
Let me see him touch you.

374
00:37:32.668 --> 00:37:35.420 line:82%
Eat this. I'll be right back.

375
00:37:40.092 --> 00:37:41.510 line:82%
I knew you'd be here.

376
00:37:41.718 --> 00:37:43.887 line:82%
I came to return the container.
I'm leaving.

377
00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:45.472 line:82%
Where are you going?

378
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:46.974 line:82%
Have some dessert and then go.

379
00:37:47.975 --> 00:37:49.184 line:82%
What's come over you?

380
00:37:50.978 --> 00:37:53.105 line:82%
This is not another act, right?

381
00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:54.272 line:82%
Who is it?

382
00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:59.111 line:82%
Does Sweety know that you fence
stolen bikes?

383
00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:04.449 line:82%
She despises thieves.

384
00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:09.454 line:82%
If she finds out, no more souffle for you.

385
00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:12.749 line:82%
-You won't be allowed in this house.
-Who is it?

386
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:15.335 line:82%
Jai.

387
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.963 line:82%
Jai, my brother.

388
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:21.758 line:82%
Jai, what's this I hear? You hit Ali?

389
00:38:22.592 --> 00:38:25.429 line:82%
Do you think I could hit anyone?

390
00:38:26.263 --> 00:38:31.309 line:82%
-Did I hit you?
-No.

391
00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:34.146 line:82%
I fell off the bike the other day.

392
00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:38.066 line:82%
Sweety, why would I hit this poor guy?

393
00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:40.527 line:82%
He didn't understand what
I was getting at.

394
00:38:40.694 --> 00:38:43.697 line:82%
I took him to the police station
because he works for us now.

395
00:38:44.364 --> 00:38:47.075 line:82%
Ali is going to help us with this case.

396
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:50.912 line:82%
I took him there to explain everything,
but he misunderstood everything.

397
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.126 line:82%
This is great news, Ali.
You were worried for nothing.

398
00:38:57.669 --> 00:39:01.423 line:82%
Good, Jai. You see? Jai is not so bad.

399
00:39:01.715 --> 00:39:03.216 line:82%
He will take good care of you.

400
00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:06.386 line:82%
Darling, let's go inside.

401
00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:09.514 line:82%
Take care of me?

402
00:39:09.723 --> 00:39:15.604 line:82%
That's what I'm afraid of. Work with you?
What kind of work?

403
00:39:15.771 --> 00:39:17.022 line:82%
I'm not doing anything.

404
00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:20.025 line:82%
My life will be in danger.
I don't want to do it.

405
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.612 line:82%
All right, this is for you.

406
00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:32.454 line:82%
Sweety will see it now,
the Court tomorrow. Simple.

407
00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:36.958 line:82%
-What are you saying, brother?
-A minimum of 3 years in jail.

408
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:40.462 line:82%
Munna, Chotu and Vinod will run
the garage till then, okay?

409
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.465 line:82%
Why are you doing this to me?

410
00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:47.552 line:82%
Why are you taking them off? Don't.
You look nice like this.

411
00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:51.098 line:82%
I'll see you at work tomorrow, correct?

412
00:39:53.308 --> 00:39:54.643 line:82%
At six on the dot.

413
00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:55.894 line:82%
Six o'clock?

414
00:39:57.145 --> 00:39:58.271 line:82%
Is there a religious ceremony?

415
00:39:58.355 --> 00:40:00.982 line:82%
Yes, I'll worship you.

416
00:40:02.067 --> 00:40:03.151 line:82%
Go now.

417
00:40:03.485 --> 00:40:05.028 line:82%
-Photo?
-Glasses?

418
00:40:05.821 --> 00:40:07.489 line:82%
-Let me say bye to Sweety.
-Leave!

419
00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:18.792 line:82%
There he is.

420
00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:22.462 line:82%
Wow, so this is your surprise?

421
00:40:22.671 --> 00:40:24.881 line:82%
An amazing car, isn't it?

422
00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:28.885 line:82%
One ride in this
and all eyes will be on you.

423
00:40:28.969 --> 00:40:31.221 line:82%
Not him, the car.

424
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.307 line:82%
-How much is it?
-Don't worry about all that.

425
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.018 line:82%
Two more heists and we're all set.

426
00:40:45.152 --> 00:40:48.280 line:82%
What do you say, Kabir? Nice?

427
00:41:09.217 --> 00:41:14.181 line:82%
3000 cc. Zero to 100 in ten seconds.

428
00:41:20.187 --> 00:41:22.063 line:82%
You should also buy a car like this.

429
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.151 line:82%
Careful.

430
00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:32.199 line:82%
Good brakes too. Stops in 5 seconds.

431
00:41:39.247 --> 00:41:41.374 line:82%
You're scaring me.

432
00:41:48.423 --> 00:41:49.883 line:82%
-Jump.
-What?

433
00:41:51.343 --> 00:41:52.510 line:82%
Jump.

434
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.075 line:82%
What have you done?

435
00:42:16.117 --> 00:42:16.952 line:82%
Have you lost it?

436
00:42:17.494 --> 00:42:18.495 line:82%
It was a new car!

437
00:42:19.621 --> 00:42:20.914 line:82%
You're very lucky, Rahul.

438
00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.709 line:82%
-You could've been in that car.
-What?

439
00:42:26.962 --> 00:42:28.546 line:82%
A waiter with a car like that?

440
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:34.386 line:82%
We're thieves. We vanish like smoke.

441
00:42:35.804 --> 00:42:39.516 line:82%
If the police suspect anything,
it's all over.

442
00:42:41.643 --> 00:42:43.311 line:82%
No one can break my rules.

443
00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:47.190 line:82%
Not even me.

444
00:43:01.997 --> 00:43:04.207 line:82%
I got a trio.

445
00:43:04.958 --> 00:43:05.792 line:82%
Thank you, Mommy.

446
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:07.669 line:82%
My luck is good.

447
00:43:08.378 --> 00:43:09.504 line:82%
One more, one more.

448
00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:11.131 line:82%
We're raising the stakes now.

449
00:43:11.464 --> 00:43:12.882 line:82%
Five hundred a head.

450
00:43:12.966 --> 00:43:14.009 line:82%
Quickly. Come on.

451
00:43:15.385 --> 00:43:16.886 line:82%
If that hot head finds out,

452
00:43:17.554 --> 00:43:21.850 line:82%
he'll eat my head for no reason.
He upsets me.

453
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:26.604 line:82%
Tenner?

454
00:43:29.733 --> 00:43:31.943 line:82%
-Brother.
-For band aid.

455
00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:37.699 line:82%
The next heist will happen here.
In this area.

456
00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:40.327 line:82%
How can you be so sure, Jai?

457
00:43:41.161 --> 00:43:42.329 line:82%
They have a pattern.

458
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:45.582 line:82%
November 20th, Borivali,
November 26, Kandivali,

459
00:43:45.665 --> 00:43:48.209 line:82%
November 30th, Malad,
December 5th, Andheri,

460
00:43:48.293 --> 00:43:50.337 line:82%
December 8th, Vile Parle.

461
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:52.589 line:82%
After all five heists,

462
00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:55.884 line:82%
the robbers vanished on their bikes
without a trace.

463
00:43:57.093 --> 00:43:58.803 line:82%
But how did they get away so fast?

464
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.264 line:82%
One thing was common in all five heists.

465
00:44:04.351 --> 00:44:05.560 line:82%
Western Express Highway.

466
00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:08.355 line:82%
Wherever these robberies have happened,

467
00:44:08.772 --> 00:44:11.691 line:82%
the highway was only 2 or 3 minutes away.

468
00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:16.196 line:82%
Which is why I think their next target
is this.

469
00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:18.907 line:82%
Can't Intelligence find out

470
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.826 line:82%
who they are and which gang
they are part of?

471
00:44:22.077 --> 00:44:23.453 line:82%
This gang operates independently.

472
00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:25.580 line:82%
No past record or history.

473
00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:30.168 line:82%
These people could be anywhere.
They could be anyone.

474
00:44:31.044 --> 00:44:32.462 line:82%
We can only catch them red-handed

475
00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:35.256 line:82%
because after these heists

476
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.300 line:82%
we'll never find out who they are.

477
00:44:37.384 --> 00:44:39.761 line:82%
How will we find out when
their next heist is?

478
00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:41.346 line:82%
It will happen soon.

479
00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:43.890 line:82%
Five heists in 20 days.

480
00:44:44.474 --> 00:44:46.101 line:82%
They have revved up their pace.

481
00:44:46.768 --> 00:44:48.937 line:82%
A few more heists and they'll be gone.

482
00:44:49.646 --> 00:44:50.480 line:82%
I think that's their plan.

483
00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.984 line:82%
But this time, we'll be staking it out.

484
00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:22.011 line:82%
-Shekhar, come in.
-Shekhar here, sir.

485
00:45:22.095 --> 00:45:25.682 line:82%
Shekhar, cover my position.
I'm going near the bank. Copy?

486
00:45:25.765 --> 00:45:26.599 line:82%
Copy that, sir.

487
00:45:38.903 --> 00:45:43.783 line:82%
I'm sure you're here. Show yourself once.

488
00:46:21.488 --> 00:46:24.699 line:82%
Hey man, make me a nice bouquet
for 10 bucks.

489
00:46:25.241 --> 00:46:27.744 line:82%
Have you every heard of a bouquet
that only costs 10 bucks?

490
00:46:27.827 --> 00:46:32.123 line:82%
-Who is it for?
-Your future sister-in-law.

491
00:46:32.207 --> 00:46:33.875 line:82%
Even I want to be a family man someday.

492
00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:37.545 line:82%
Stop fooling around. If Jai sees us,
we'll be in trouble.

493
00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:39.005 line:82%
Who's scared of your boss?

494
00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:40.965 line:82%
Make me my bouquet. That's it.

495
00:46:41.049 --> 00:46:45.136 line:82%
-Make do with this rose.
-One rose for 10 bucks?

496
00:46:48.848 --> 00:46:49.933 line:82%
We were just...

497
00:46:50.517 --> 00:46:54.312 line:82%
Shekhar, take a break.

498
00:46:54.395 --> 00:46:56.105 line:82%
-See you at six tomorrow.
-Okay, sir.

499
00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:02.195 line:82%
I'll leave too.

500
00:47:09.577 --> 00:47:12.080 line:82%
Home. Sweety has made chicken.

501
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.671 line:82%
You can't go home till we've caught
these guys.

502
00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:22.715 line:82%
Does that mean we'll keep waiting for them
as long as it takes?

503
00:47:22.799 --> 00:47:24.676 line:82%
Why? Are you busy?

504
00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:26.803 line:82%
You've been invited to inaugurate
a new prison wing?

505
00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:29.180 line:82%
But Sweety's chicken...

506
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:33.601 line:82%
Why doesn't he wear contact lenses?

507
00:47:35.562 --> 00:47:37.021 line:82%
Okay.

508
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:39.983 line:82%
I'll eat on time.

509
00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.029 line:82%
Okay, now, bye.

510
00:47:46.364 --> 00:47:48.116 line:82%
What is it, Sweety? I'm working.

511
00:47:50.535 --> 00:47:51.369 line:82%
Okay.

512
00:47:52.704 --> 00:47:54.622 line:82%
Yes, I love you too. Bye.

513
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:02.505 line:82%
What?

514
00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:06.676 line:82%
Tell me.

515
00:48:07.844 --> 00:48:11.264 line:82%
-First, promise me.
-What?

516
00:48:12.307 --> 00:48:15.101 line:82%
-That you won't hit me.
-No.

517
00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:22.692 line:82%
No, what? You won't hit me
or won't promise?

518
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.236 line:82%
I can't promise that I won't hit you.

519
00:48:27.488 --> 00:48:29.032 line:82%
Okay, I won't tell you.

520
00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:37.415 line:82%
Okay, tell me.

521
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:45.089 line:82%
You know that Sweety and I
were going to marry, right?

522
00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:46.716 line:82%
-What?
-Yes.

523
00:48:47.759 --> 00:48:50.428 line:82%
If I had met her first, then yes.
Guaranteed.

524
00:48:52.138 --> 00:48:53.806 line:82%
Was she more ravishing back then?

525
00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:58.019 line:82%
You want a beating now or later?

526
00:48:59.187 --> 00:49:01.064 line:82%
Must've been an arranged marriage.

527
00:49:02.398 --> 00:49:06.861 line:82%
It was an arranged marriage, right?
Tell me!

528
00:49:08.529 --> 00:49:09.364 line:82%
Hello, Sweety.

529
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:13.076 line:82%
There's an envelope on the table, right?

530
00:49:14.619 --> 00:49:17.705 line:82%
The one with my photos?
No, please. If Sweety sees them, then...

531
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:20.083 line:82%
Yes, it's there, right?

532
00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:24.253 line:82%
Brother, I will be ruined.

533
00:49:24.754 --> 00:49:27.507 line:82%
-She will never see my face again.
-Who?

534
00:49:27.632 --> 00:49:30.426 line:82%
Sweety... I mean, your wife. Who else?

535
00:49:32.929 --> 00:49:37.767 line:82%
Put it in my study, okay? Thanks, bye.

536
00:49:48.528 --> 00:49:50.822 line:82%
Don't cry for me, Mommy.

537
00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:54.992 line:82%
It won't make a difference
to his cold heart.

538
00:49:56.035 --> 00:49:57.203 line:82%
Will you shut up or...

539
00:50:52.675 --> 00:50:55.052 line:82%
-Sit quietly.
-What?

540
00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:01.309 line:82%
The public is in distress
and the police are just watching?

541
00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:04.562 line:82%
This is not right.

542
00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:07.106 line:82%
It's our duty to help people.

543
00:51:07.273 --> 00:51:09.275 line:82%
You're making her helpless.

544
00:51:10.735 --> 00:51:12.612 line:82%
Some guy, by God.

545
00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:15.448 line:82%
Okay, you sit tight. Let me help her.

546
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.451 line:82%
I'm a mechanic. It's my duty.

547
00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:21.078 line:82%
It's my duty to work on
broken down vehicles.

548
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:21.996 line:82%
Excuse me.

549
00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:28.711 line:82%
My car seems to have broken down.
Could you help me out please?

550
00:52:28.396 --> 00:52:33.025 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

551
00:52:35.736 --> 00:52:41.033 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

552
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:46.289 line:82%
I want to be in your heart
Make myself a family

553
00:52:46.372 --> 00:52:49.083 line:82%
It's my heart's only wish

554
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:50.251 line:82%
There he goes again.

555
00:52:50.626 --> 00:52:55.298 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

556
00:52:57.884 --> 00:53:02.763 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

557
00:53:05.391 --> 00:53:08.644 line:82%
I want to be in your heart
Make myself a family

558
00:53:08.728 --> 00:53:11.480 line:82%
It's my heart's only wish

559
00:53:11.564 --> 00:53:13.190 line:82%
Forget it. She's out of your league.

560
00:53:23.326 --> 00:53:26.913 line:82%
You're mine

561
00:53:26.996 --> 00:53:28.915 line:82%
I'm yours

562
00:53:35.504 --> 00:53:36.505 line:82%
Incorrigible.

563
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:39.967 line:82%
No sister-in law or brother-in-law

564
00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:44.138 line:82%
I have a house that's empty

565
00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:55.149 line:82%
No sister-in law or brother-in-law

566
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:58.778 line:82%
I have a house that's empty

567
00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:01.989 line:82%
No dreams, nobody to call my own

568
00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.743 line:82%
No wife either

569
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.120 line:82%
You're lonely and so am I

570
00:54:08.204 --> 00:54:12.416 line:82%
You look so lively
Let's fall in love

571
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:13.709 line:82%
Should I come?

572
00:54:13.793 --> 00:54:19.590 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

573
00:54:20.841 --> 00:54:26.347 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

574
00:54:52.498 --> 00:54:55.876 line:82%
You look like a crazy guy

575
00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:59.922 line:82%
You make lovely excuses

576
00:55:07.221 --> 00:55:11.017 line:82%
You look like a crazy guy

577
00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:14.520 line:82%
You make lovely excuses

578
00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:20.568 line:82%
How do I give my heart away
To a stranger like you?

579
00:55:22.194 --> 00:55:28.075 line:82%
I'll let you know my decision tomorrow
Give me some time to think

580
00:55:28.159 --> 00:55:29.326 line:82%
She's a fast girl.

581
00:55:29.493 --> 00:55:35.041 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

582
00:55:37.418 --> 00:55:43.382 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

583
00:55:43.966 --> 00:55:47.845 line:82%
I want to be in your heart
Make myself a family

584
00:55:47.928 --> 00:55:50.723 line:82%
It's my heart's only wish

585
00:55:52.516 --> 00:55:57.897 line:82%
Sweetheart
You're mine and I'm yours

586
00:55:58.272 --> 00:56:01.776 line:82%
You're mine and I'm yours

587
00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:05.571 line:82%
You're mine and I'm yours

588
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:08.741 line:82%
She's gone. Let's work?

589
00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:15.915 line:82%
-Shekhar?
-Yes, sir.

590
00:56:17.124 --> 00:56:17.958 line:82%
Hello, sir.

591
00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:21.128 line:82%
-Over here.
-Enough with your pranks.

592
00:56:21.504 --> 00:56:23.005 line:82%
-Do me a favor.
-What?

593
00:56:23.798 --> 00:56:28.469 line:82%
-I need to find that girl.
-We need her address or photo for that.

594
00:56:29.261 --> 00:56:30.805 line:82%
If I had all that, would I ask you?

595
00:56:30.888 --> 00:56:33.474 line:82%
-What kind of a policeman are you?
-Shekhar.

596
00:56:33.808 --> 00:56:35.518 line:82%
-Stop fooling around!
-Shekhar.

597
00:56:36.143 --> 00:56:36.977 line:82%
Sir?

598
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:39.563 line:82%
Take the left gate. Update me
every five minutes.

599
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.564 line:82%
Okay, sir.

600
00:56:43.818 --> 00:56:46.612 line:82%
Yeah, repeat. Okay, copy that.

601
00:56:46.695 --> 00:56:47.822 line:82%
One question, sir.

602
00:56:49.115 --> 00:56:52.159 line:82%
I want to improve my general knowledge.

603
00:56:53.077 --> 00:56:55.037 line:82%
You're a walking, talking encyclopedia.

604
00:56:57.248 --> 00:56:59.083 line:82%
-Shut up. No, shut up.
-No, I mean.

605
00:57:00.543 --> 00:57:02.586 line:82%
Shut up and work. Understood?

606
00:57:07.842 --> 00:57:10.845 line:82%
Bikes. Bikes are coming.

607
00:57:14.682 --> 00:57:16.851 line:82%
Not coming, they're leaving.

608
00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:20.896 line:82%
Go.

609
00:59:38.575 --> 00:59:40.703 line:82%
Get them. Don't let them escape.

610
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:43.414 line:82%
They're getting away. Hurry up!

611
00:59:45.958 --> 00:59:49.211 line:82%
I'm at 260. Full throttle.

612
00:59:49.336 --> 00:59:50.671 line:82%
They're doing over 300.

613
00:59:53.716 --> 00:59:54.550 line:82%
Damn!

614
00:59:57.094 --> 00:59:57.928 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

615
01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:03.892 line:82%
Take table twelve's order.

616
01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:05.686 line:82%
We must do something about him, Kabir.

617
01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:08.355 line:82%
Not here.

618
01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:10.316 line:82%
Rohit is my brother.

619
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:12.151 line:82%
He could've died!

620
01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:14.153 line:82%
I said, not here.

621
01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.906 line:82%
-Take their order.
-I don't care about table 12.

622
01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.950 line:82%
I won't spare that cop.

623
01:00:23.162 --> 01:00:24.955 line:82%
I'll do what needs to be done.

624
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:27.666 line:82%
Don't try anything funny.

625
01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:29.543 line:82%
Kabir...

626
01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.090 line:82%
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening, table for two, please.

627
01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:39.887 line:82%
Come.

628
01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.474 line:82%
Rohit, go upstairs.

629
01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:52.149 line:82%
Jai Dixit has been specially called upon
to fight this recent surge of crimes.

630
01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:56.028 line:82%
Jai, you're on TV.

631
01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.615 line:82%
You have always solved your cases swiftly.

632
01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:02.618 line:82%
Why is it taking so long to get hold of
this bike gang?

633
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.953 line:82%
Have you seen rats stealing?

634
01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:08.791 line:82%
They steal and quickly escape
into their holes.

635
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.834 line:82%
This bike gang is no different.

636
01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.297 line:82%
They wear masks, rob
and escape on fast bikes.

637
01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:18.634 line:82%
We foiled one of their operations
last week.

638
01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:23.138 line:82%
Hopefully, this gang won't trouble us
for very long.

639
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.973 line:82%
A message for the audience?

640
01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:29.061 line:82%
I just want to say that we will get them
very soon.

641
01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:31.188 line:82%
Do you want to say something to the gang?

642
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:33.524 line:82%
They could be watching as well.

643
01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.692 line:82%
No, ma'am. I don't talk to criminals.

644
01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.737 line:82%
Thank you, sir. That was ACP Jai Dixit.

645
01:01:38.821 --> 01:01:41.323 line:82%
For other news, please stay tuned.

646
01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.706 line:82%
-I want to give it back to him.
-Be cool.

647
01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:54.336 line:82%
Their bill is on us. We don't have
people like him walk in everyday.

648
01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.214 line:82%
-Take care of them.
-I will.

649
01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:00.634 line:82%
I have to take care of him now.

650
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.555 line:82%
I'll take good care of him.

651
01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:07.433 line:82%
Well done, Jai.

652
01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:10.519 line:82%
So what if we didn't catch the thieves?

653
01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:12.479 line:82%
We have their loot in our possession.

654
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:16.400 line:82%
This bike will tell us
how they're so fast.

655
01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:18.777 line:82%
-Ali.
-Hold this.

656
01:02:18.861 --> 01:02:20.529 line:82%
I have taken a good look at this.

657
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:24.366 line:82%
Wonderful engineering.
And this nitrous oxide cylinder.

658
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:25.784 line:82%
What this does is,

659
01:02:25.868 --> 01:02:28.704 line:82%
at the press of a button,
the bike turns into a rocket.

660
01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:30.914 line:82%
Another highlight is this timing advancer.

661
01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:32.082 line:82%
What this does is--

662
01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:33.250 line:82%
Good, very good.

663
01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:40.549 line:82%
-Jai, what is our next move?
-Sir, they're the ones who are hurt.

664
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.177 line:82%
The next move will be theirs.

665
01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:44.470 line:82%
Call for you, sir.

666
01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:46.138 line:82%
Hello?

667
01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:50.017 line:82%
-I didn't call to gossip with you.
-Who is this?

668
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.394 line:82%
If I do all the talking,
then what will you do?

669
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.355 line:82%
How will you give those TV interviews?

670
01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:02.571 line:82%
Then I'm sure you heard me saying
I don't talk to criminals.

671
01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:07.201 line:82%
-See you in jail.
-Thanks for the offer.

672
01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:10.496 line:82%
I'm not destined to be in prison.

673
01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:12.789 line:82%
Your destiny is well written.

674
01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:19.046 line:82%
Your brains too, but your future
seems a bit bleak.

675
01:03:19.338 --> 01:03:20.172 line:82%
Really?

676
01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:25.344 line:82%
Since you took the trouble to call me,
it's my duty to warn you.

677
01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:34.019 line:82%
Aren't you a little over confident?

678
01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:38.273 line:82%
Okay then, give me your address.

679
01:03:38.524 --> 01:03:41.818 line:82%
I'll send the money and the bike.
It will boost your confidence a bit.

680
01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.196 line:82%
Say whatever you want.

681
01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:45.906 line:82%
You will never catch me.

682
01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.576 line:82%
You're not some hero. You're a thief.

683
01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.411 line:82%
You will run and I will catch you.

684
01:03:51.954 --> 01:03:55.290 line:82%
I'll walk right past you
and you won't recognize me.

685
01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:59.545 line:82%
Show yourself once and you won't
recognize yourself anymore.

686
01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:02.422 line:82%
Okay, I will come meet you.

687
01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:06.093 line:82%
I will also tell you where
the next heist is.

688
01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.345 line:82%
Have you met thieves like me before?

689
01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:12.099 line:82%
Thieves are meant to be found in prison.

690
01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.477 line:82%
Don't worry. That's where
you will be soon.

691
01:04:15.978 --> 01:04:20.190 line:82%
You will know the time and place
of the heist in advance.

692
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.777 line:82%
If you nab me, you win and I go to prison.

693
01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.114 line:82%
And if I escape?

694
01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:28.532 line:82%
Impossible.

695
01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:31.702 line:82%
I love the impossible, Mr. Dixit.

696
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.745 line:82%
I have one condition.

697
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:38.083 line:82%
If you don't catch me,
you will drop the case.

698
01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:44.423 line:82%
-What happened? Did I scare you?
-Where are we meeting?

699
01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:07.422 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

700
01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:10.133 line:82%
Where are you headed?

701
01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:13.136 line:82%
Over there.

702
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:17.683 line:82%
Come, I'll help you get there.

703
01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:21.395 line:82%
No, I'll go. Don't waste your time.

704
01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:25.816 line:82%
Helping someone is not a waste of time.
Be careful.

705
01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:29.611 line:82%
You are very kind.

706
01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:33.198 line:82%
Not really.

707
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:36.576 line:82%
This is not the age of goodness.

708
01:06:39.538 --> 01:06:44.000 line:82%
No matter how quickly evil spreads,

709
01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:46.545 line:82%
it's always a few steps behind goodness.

710
01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:11.755 line:82%
-You have something to say?
-How will we do it, Kabir?

711
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.424 line:82%
The entire police force will be there.

712
01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:18.929 line:82%
Politicians will be there.
It's a high security zone.

713
01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:22.641 line:82%
Forget robbing them, we won't even
be able to enter.

714
01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:31.441 line:82%
We will do it.

715
01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:34.402 line:82%
And in front of everyone.

716
01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:39.950 line:82%
And we'll escape in front of them.
Trust me.

717
01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:43.286 line:82%
Bullets are faster than our bikes.

718
01:08:43.954 --> 01:08:47.332 line:82%
Speed is not in the bullet,
it depends on the marksman.

719
01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:32.544 line:82%
Fall in love if you want to

720
01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.838 line:82%
Live or die in love

721
01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.716 line:82%
Love is the loveliest thing

722
01:09:39.092 --> 01:09:42.178 line:82%
Fall in love if you want to

723
01:09:42.262 --> 01:09:44.472 line:82%
Live or die in love

724
01:09:44.556 --> 01:09:47.267 line:82%
True love won't happen twice

725
01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:51.646 line:82%
Love is the essence of life

726
01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:54.065 line:82%
Love is the reason for all happiness

727
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:58.153 line:82%
Lose yourself in love and sway

728
01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:02.490 line:82%
Let's rock it, let's rock it
Let's rock it

729
01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:06.953 line:82%
Let's rock it, let's rock it

Let's rock it, let's rock it
Let's rock it

732
01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:53.416 line:82%
What's in love?

733
01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:58.004 line:82%
Ask someone who's been in love

734
01:10:58.213 --> 01:11:00.632 line:82%
Why they have a spring in their step

735
01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:03.051 line:82%
Why they have a smile on their face

736
01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:07.931 line:82%
Ask someone who's been in love

737
01:11:08.223 --> 01:11:12.978 line:82%

Love lasts four days

743
01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:32.539 line:82%
It happens only once

744
01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:37.460 line:82%
Kiss the shadows of love

745
01:11:37.544 --> 01:11:41.214 line:82%
Let's rock it, let's rock it
Let's rock it

746
01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:45.427 line:82%
Let's rock it, let's rock it

Oh, yeah

753
01:12:37.312 --> 01:12:41.566 line:82%
Nobody can live alone

754
01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:46.154 line:82%
Every soul here knows

755
01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:51.201 line:82%
My heart desires a random stranger

756
01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:55.830 line:82%
You should also commit the same crime

757
01:12:56.331 --> 01:13:01.127 line:82%
Nobody can live alone

758
01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:05.632 line:82%

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:53.012 line:82%
That's it? How is this okay? I just came.

769
01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:55.598 line:82%
Guys, what do you say when you
want her to do it again?

770
01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:58.351 line:82%
-Once more!
-Yes, once more.

771
01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:25.545 line:82%
Fall in love if you want to

772
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.881 line:82%

784
01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:16.930 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen...

785
01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:21.643 line:82%
The proceeds from this show goes to
the Chief Minister's Relief Fund.

786
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:26.147 line:82%
We have raised 42,50,000 rupees.
Take a look.

787
01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:36.115 line:82%
Where is the money? It's empty.

788
01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:25.767 line:82%
Sweetheart? Ambulance?

789
01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:27.078 line:82%
What happened, sir?

790
01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:32.458 line:82%
These guys work at Pizza Place.

791
01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:36.421 line:82%
Should we go there now?

792
01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:41.092 line:82%
No, we won't find them there.

793
01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:45.430 line:82%
-Ali!
-Jai...

794
01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:46.931 line:82%
How much did you sell out for?

795
01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:48.558 line:82%
This girl fainted, so...

796
01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:51.894 line:82%
-How much money did you take?
-This is not my fault.

797
01:18:51.978 --> 01:18:54.021 line:82%
I'm telling you it's not my fault.

798
01:18:58.401 --> 01:18:59.944 line:82%
No discounts on courtesy.

799
01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:06.242 line:82%
Brother, it won't be nice
if I raise my hand on you.

800
01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:17.795 line:82%
Your job was to be ready with the bike.

801
01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:19.589 line:82%
Not with the girl.

802
01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.936 line:82%
Once again, the mysterious bike gang

803
01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.856 line:82%
has robbed a charity event
and sent everyone in a tizzy.

804
01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:41.235 line:82%
Sources indicate that the police
were tipped off about it.

805
01:19:41.319 --> 01:19:43.821 line:82%
But as always, they didn't do anything
to stop it.

806
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:47.241 line:82%
Jai Dixit, what do you have to say
about them getting away

807
01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:49.535 line:82%
in spite of all precautions?

808
01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:52.663 line:82%
They didn't escape because they're smart.
I made a mistake.

809
01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.248 line:82%
I made a very big mistake.

810
01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:56.083 line:82%
Therefore, on moral grounds,

811
01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:58.753 line:82%
I am dropping the case
and resigning from the force.

812
01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:01.380 line:82%
-And what about Ali?
-He doesn't work with us anymore.

813
01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:04.342 line:82%
-Does that mean--
-I think you know what I mean, ma'am.

814
01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:05.426 line:82%
Excuse me.

815
01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:09.305 line:82%
That was ACP Jai Dixit.

816
01:20:12.642 --> 01:20:13.476 line:82%
Rahul.

817
01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:17.605 line:82%
Where are you going?

818
01:20:19.524 --> 01:20:23.361 line:82%
He's not a cop anymore. I won't spare him.

819
01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:27.573 line:82%
Don't be stupid. Killing him
won't bring Rohit back.

820
01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:31.577 line:82%
We have a lot of work to do.
Concentrate on that.

821
01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:37.208 line:82%
Who will take Rohit's place?

822
01:20:37.792 --> 01:20:39.669 line:82%
Without him we can't function.

823
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:47.260 line:82%
You get ready to leave the city.

824
01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:49.887 line:82%
I'll take care of the rest.

825
01:21:00.982 --> 01:21:03.734 line:82%
-What's wrong with Ali today?
-He's ahead from the beginning.

826
01:21:16.998 --> 01:21:20.543 line:82%
The race has begun.
What will you be entering now?

827
01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.277 line:82%
Who is that?

828
01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:49.572 line:82%
He's very fast.

829
01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:02.603 line:82%
Sorry.

830
01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:04.897 line:82%
Never mind. It happens.

831
01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.108 line:82%
We've made so much money because of you.

832
01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:10.486 line:82%
-One loss won't change anything.
-But you lost a lot of money.

833
01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:12.279 line:82%
Today has been a terrible day.

834
01:23:12.363 --> 01:23:15.199 line:82%
I fought with Jai. Went to the hospital
and that girl vanished.

835
01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:18.828 line:82%
I thought I'd vent out on the track.
This was a flop.

836
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.871 line:82%
I want to break that guy's face.

837
01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:28.462 line:82%
What are you looking at?

838
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:33.676 line:82%
-I won't take money for losing.
-I don't race for money.

839
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.347 line:82%
I want something priceless.

840
01:23:44.395 --> 01:23:46.188 line:82%
No, sir. I can't do all this.

841
01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.733 line:82%
I don't fancy getting shot by the police.

842
01:23:49.984 --> 01:23:51.402 line:82%
The police can't touch you

843
01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:56.073 line:82%
and you know it. Are you scared of them?

844
01:23:57.366 --> 01:24:01.829 line:82%
Me? If I could, I would drown them all
in the sea.

845
01:24:02.246 --> 01:24:03.456 line:82%
Jai would be the first.

846
01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:05.875 line:82%
I would hit him so hard.

847
01:24:08.294 --> 01:24:09.879 line:82%
Harder than I care to tell you.

848
01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:12.965 line:82%
What are you waiting for?

849
01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:19.263 line:82%
I'm wondering if I should trust you.

850
01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:20.723 line:82%
You could be a traitor.

851
01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:34.737 line:82%
No cop has seen this face before.

852
01:24:36.113 --> 01:24:37.364 line:82%
They never will.

853
01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:42.995 line:82%
Even if you don't think so,
you're worth millions.

854
01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:46.749 line:82%
Don't waste your life, Ali.

855
01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.796 line:82%
If I tell the cops that I've seen you,

856
01:24:52.797 --> 01:24:54.465 line:82%
I'll be rewarded for sure.

857
01:24:56.467 --> 01:24:59.678 line:82%
They've already repaid you in full
for helping them.

858
01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:03.891 line:82%
I know you will hesitate
to help them again.

859
01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.268 line:82%
Six o' clock tomorrow at Khopoli crossing.

860
01:25:06.352 --> 01:25:08.062 line:82%
I'll be waiting for you there.

861
01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:09.522 line:82%
I'll see you there.

862
01:25:12.525 --> 01:25:14.568 line:82%
I'm not a morning person.

863
01:25:14.652 --> 01:25:19.073 line:82%
Your luck is changing and so will you.

864
01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:06.120 line:82%
My mother always said that I was smart
and fast.

865
01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:08.956 line:82%
-You want to be smart and fast?
-Why not?

866
01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:10.207 line:82%
Open the door.

867
01:26:12.585 --> 01:26:13.627 line:82%
Close it.

868
01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:14.879 line:82%
Hey, Tony!

869
01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:17.423 line:82%
Ali, something's up with my bike.

870
01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:18.716 line:82%
-What's wrong?
-The gear doesn't work.

871
01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:21.677 line:82%
If I don't fix it, I'll change my name.

872
01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:27.266 line:82%
What will you name yourself? Rohit?

873
01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:29.852 line:82%
My mother gave me such a nice name.

874
01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:33.188 line:82%
So why change it? Sorry Tony,
no changing names. Rahul is right.

875
01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:36.525 line:82%
Rahul, if there's something wrong
with your bike, do tell me.

876
01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:37.735 line:82%
Don't touch it.

877
01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:41.822 line:82%
You'll take Rohit's place?
He's dead because of you.

878
01:26:41.906 --> 01:26:43.574 line:82%
I'm on your side now, brother.

879
01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:44.783 line:82%
I'm no brother to you.

880
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:48.621 line:82%
If I raise my hand to you,
you'll lose your manhood.

881
01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:50.623 line:82%
-You bloody--
-Boys.

882
01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:53.459 line:82%
Take it easy.

883
01:26:57.922 --> 01:26:59.465 line:82%
I don't like his face.

884
01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:03.552 line:82%
I don't like your face and I know
you don't like mine.

885
01:27:05.012 --> 01:27:09.975 line:82%
We're not friends, we need each other.

886
01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:11.560 line:82%
That's it.

887
01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.564 line:82%
After this next heist,

888
01:27:16.357 --> 01:27:18.400 line:82%
no one will have to

889
01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:23.280 line:82%
steal anymore or tolerate each other.

890
01:27:25.616 --> 01:27:27.785 line:82%
So, stop fighting.

891
01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:33.707 line:82%
I want all six of us present here
in the evening.

892
01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:37.086 line:82%
Let's get down to some serious work.

893
01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:45.761 line:82%
Kabir, brother, listen to me.

894
01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:50.265 line:82%
You're amazing but you've made a mistake.

895
01:27:50.808 --> 01:27:54.478 line:82%
We're five, not six. Mannu, Tony and I.

896
01:27:54.937 --> 01:27:59.483 line:82%
-Mr. Bombastic and you. Five.
-We're six, not five.

897
01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.486 line:82%
Come on, count. Mannu, Tony and I.

898
01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:03.612 line:82%
Ali...

899
01:29:11.305 --> 01:29:13.015 line:82%
Thank you, thank you, Mommy.

900
01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:21.815 line:82%
You're a wonderful actress.

901
01:29:21.899 --> 01:29:24.985 line:82%
Dance, romance. I left you
in the ambulance

902
01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.863 line:82%
and now I find you riding the waves.

903
01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:29.198 line:82%
Wow, sweetheart.

904
01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:33.827 line:82%
My name is Sheena.

905
01:29:34.995 --> 01:29:38.290 line:82%
And whatever I did with you
was part of my job.

906
01:29:39.249 --> 01:29:42.377 line:82%
My job... So you and me...

907
01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:44.797 line:82%
Don't even think about it.

908
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.220 line:82%
What is this, Mommy?

909
01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:52.888 line:82%
You sent me one girl,
even she's not interested.

910
01:29:54.932 --> 01:29:56.892 line:82%
Too many hassles in life.

911
01:29:57.976 --> 01:30:01.438 line:82%
Taj Exotica. Goa's largest
and most luxurious hotel.

912
01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:04.733 line:82%
Yes, it's a lovely hotel.

913
01:30:06.235 --> 01:30:08.362 line:82%
But we're thieves, not tourists.

914
01:30:10.072 --> 01:30:12.074 line:82%
What the hell are we doing here?

915
01:30:16.245 --> 01:30:17.496 line:82%
Look at it through a thieves' eyes

916
01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.751 line:82%
and you'll see 18 crore rupees.

917
01:30:28.298 --> 01:30:30.050 line:82%
This is India's biggest casino.

918
01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:36.974 line:82%
Fortunes are made and lost every day.

919
01:30:40.561 --> 01:30:42.312 line:82%
No matter what the gambler's luck,

920
01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:45.107 line:82%
the casino always wins.

921
01:30:48.694 --> 01:30:52.239 line:82%
Last year on New Years Eve,
the casino raked in 16 crores.

922
01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.908 line:82%
The casino's earnings

923
01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.873 line:82%
are locked away in a high security vault
in the casino's basement.

924
01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:04.710 line:82%
They are so confident
in their security system

925
01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:06.628 line:82%
that they haven't
installed cameras anywhere.

926
01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:13.844 line:82%
The management is expecting

927
01:31:13.927 --> 01:31:16.471 line:82%
to make a minimum of 18 crores this year
on New Year's Eve.

928
01:31:27.191 --> 01:31:28.192 line:82%
Eighteen crores.

929
01:31:30.903 --> 01:31:32.070 line:82%
Six thieves.

930
01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:35.240 line:82%
Equal share.

931
01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:37.868 line:82%
How much is our share put together?

932
01:31:38.619 --> 01:31:41.580 line:82%
-I'm bad at math, that's why.
-Ali.

933
01:31:43.665 --> 01:31:48.045 line:82%
This is our last heist.
We're free after this.

934
01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.673 line:82%
We will never see each other again,

935
01:31:53.175 --> 01:31:54.927 line:82%
nor will we try to make contact.

936
01:31:55.886 --> 01:31:59.723 line:82%
The idea is nice. But this is a hotel,
not a bank.

937
01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:01.516 line:82%
Big crowds and a big risk.

938
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.939 line:82%
Mannu says that the security system
was designed by an Israeli company.

939
01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:11.235 line:82%
-Opening the safe won't be easy.
-There is an infrared alarm at the door.

940
01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:15.530 line:82%
The Goan police
will be here in 30 seconds.

941
01:32:16.198 --> 01:32:18.575 line:82%
Kabir must have thought about this
in advance.

942
01:32:19.409 --> 01:32:21.078 line:82%
What I wanna know is...

943
01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:23.121 line:82%
how will we pull this off?

944
01:32:24.748 --> 01:32:26.375 line:82%
I wanted to ask the same thing.

945
01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:33.257 line:82%
Whatever we do, we'll do it in style.

946
01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:43.725 line:82%
What an amazing place.

947
01:32:53.527 --> 01:32:56.113 line:82%
-We have a reservation.
-Under what name?

948
01:32:56.196 --> 01:32:59.449 line:82%
Prince Ali Akbar Fateh Khan
of Secunderabad.

949
01:32:59.533 --> 01:33:03.203 line:82%
Yes, of course.
You've requested for suite 101, right?

950
01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:05.330 line:82%
-Right.
-Come this way.

951
01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:11.753 line:82%
Hi, Austin Powers. You lodged a complaint?

952
01:33:11.837 --> 01:33:16.633 line:82%
-There's a virus in the system.
-Don't worry. I'm here to fix it

953
01:33:16.717 --> 01:33:18.093 line:82%
This way, please.

954
01:33:23.974 --> 01:33:26.143 line:82%
At this hotel, we offer a variety
of suites.

955
01:33:26.685 --> 01:33:32.441 line:82%
-Any reason behind your choice?
-We're on our honeymoon.

956
01:33:32.649 --> 01:33:37.404 line:82%
The royal astrologer advised us to pick
this number so we could conceive a boy.

957
01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:38.905 line:82%
Excuse me, sir.

958
01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:41.575 line:82%
Thank you.

959
01:33:46.455 --> 01:33:48.999 line:82%
-Give me back the money.
-What?

960
01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:51.626 line:82%
-It's my money.
-It's Kabir's money.

961
01:33:52.294 --> 01:33:54.838 line:82%
Okay, loan it to me.

962
01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:57.341 line:82%
I don't know what Kabir was thinking
when he picked him.

963
01:33:57.424 --> 01:34:01.178 line:82%
Because he knows
that you're in love with me.

964
01:34:02.596 --> 01:34:04.848 line:82%
Limit the blabbing to this room.

965
01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.060 line:82%
Downstairs, you're a prince.

966
01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:11.480 line:82%
Yes, thank you, very okay.

967
01:34:11.563 --> 01:34:13.231 line:82%
Exhausted your English vocabulary
in one sentence.

968
01:34:13.357 --> 01:34:14.900 line:82%
Save some for tonight.

969
01:34:15.442 --> 01:34:16.777 line:82%
Hello, room service.

970
01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.403 line:82%
Take room 101's order.

971
01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:19.363 line:82%
Got it.

972
01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:23.450 line:82%
It's good you're here.

973
01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:27.079 line:82%
I'm glad you're here. Manage the bar.
What's your name?

974
01:34:28.538 --> 01:34:29.373 line:82%
Kabir.

975
01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:40.509 line:82%
You play like a seasoned gambler.

976
01:34:40.592 --> 01:34:42.636 line:82%
If you're so good, why are we stealing?

977
01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:45.097 line:82%
Ali, you're a prince, not a thief.
Don't forget.

978
01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:47.849 line:82%
Sweetheart, don't blab much.

979
01:34:48.058 --> 01:34:49.267 line:82%
Daddy is listening.

980
01:34:50.644 --> 01:34:52.145 line:82%
Good evening, everything okay?

981
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:54.481 line:82%
-Yes, very okay, thank you.
-Good.

982
01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:58.693 line:82%
-Problem is, we're leaving tonight.
-Yes, at 13 minutes past 12.

983
01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:01.780 line:82%
-Have we done something wrong?
-No.

984
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:05.283 line:82%
The royal astrologer called
and even my father insists.

985
01:35:05.367 --> 01:35:08.078 line:82%
-We have to leave.
-We'll be back next week.

986
01:35:08.286 --> 01:35:09.538 line:82%
Wonderful.

987
01:35:09.955 --> 01:35:11.081 line:82%
Our luggage is packed.

988
01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:12.499 line:82%
Please load it in the car?

989
01:35:12.582 --> 01:35:13.417 line:82%
Don't worry my dear.

990
01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:16.878 line:82%
Your baggage will be in the car
before you leave.

991
01:35:16.962 --> 01:35:17.796 line:82%
Thank you so much.

992
01:35:17.879 --> 01:35:19.756 line:82%
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

993
01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:23.510 line:82%
By then we would have robbed the place.

994
01:35:23.593 --> 01:35:26.763 line:82%
Ali, do not use that word.

995
01:35:27.597 --> 01:35:29.474 line:82%
Who do we have to fear here?

996
01:35:30.016 --> 01:35:31.476 line:82%
There aren't any cops here.

997
01:35:34.604 --> 01:35:36.148 line:82%
One whiskey, please.

998
01:35:41.528 --> 01:35:43.905 line:82%
One whiskey, please.

999
01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:46.825 line:82%
What are you drinking?

1000
01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:52.289 line:82%
I forgot.

1001
01:35:54.583 --> 01:35:57.043 line:82%
Anything will do, but make it quick.

1002
01:35:57.127 --> 01:36:00.589 line:82%
Or else my wife will find out.

1003
01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.054 line:82%
Here.

1004
01:36:09.139 --> 01:36:11.641 line:82%
-Will you have a drink?
-No, thanks.

1005
01:36:11.725 --> 01:36:12.726 line:82%
I don't drink.

1006
01:36:12.809 --> 01:36:16.021 line:82%
What? Really?

1007
01:36:17.647 --> 01:36:22.569 line:82%
You're a bartender and you don't drink?

1008
01:36:24.863 --> 01:36:25.947 line:82%
How?

1009
01:36:26.907 --> 01:36:29.701 line:82%
There's alcohol all around you.

1010
01:36:30.744 --> 01:36:32.287 line:82%
Very bad.

1011
01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:35.290 line:82%
There's money flying around too,
but I don't steal.

1012
01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:37.626 line:82%
Very good.

1013
01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:48.470 line:82%
You know, I used to be a cop.

1014
01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:52.015 line:82%
Was.

1015
01:36:54.476 --> 01:36:55.936 line:82%
Don't tell anyone.

1016
01:36:56.478 --> 01:36:58.021 line:82%
They'll panic and run.

1017
01:36:58.355 --> 01:36:59.731 line:82%
Don't worry.

1018
01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:04.277 line:82%
I won't tell anyone you're drunk
or that you're a cop.

1019
01:37:05.946 --> 01:37:10.242 line:82%
-Was.
-Okay, were.

1020
01:37:13.662 --> 01:37:15.539 line:82%
-Thanks buddy.
-Happy New Year.

1021
01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:20.126 line:82%
Happy New Year.

1022
01:37:20.210 --> 01:37:21.294 line:82%
Now?

1023
01:37:23.213 --> 01:37:24.548 line:82%
It's at midnight.

1024
01:37:24.631 --> 01:37:25.799 line:82%
What if we don't meet tomorrow?

1025
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.760 line:82%
Happy New Year in advance.

1026
01:37:33.139 --> 01:37:37.060 line:82%
No, my friend. We will meet.

1027
01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:41.481 line:82%
We'll definitely meet in the new year.

1028
01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:45.193 line:82%
I like you.

1029
01:37:47.779 --> 01:37:48.613 line:82%
My drink.

1030
01:37:53.952 --> 01:37:58.081 line:82%
Was. Was.

1031
01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:06.423 line:82%
ACP Jai Dixit is in the hotel.

1032
01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:12.178 line:82%
How did this happen? What do we do?

1033
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:14.931 line:82%
-I warned you!
-Rahul.

1034
01:38:16.182 --> 01:38:17.017 line:82%
It's serious, Kabir.

1035
01:38:19.603 --> 01:38:20.729 line:82%
Where is Ali?

1036
01:38:21.521 --> 01:38:24.441 line:82%
Darling, let's leave. Get your luggage.

1037
01:38:24.733 --> 01:38:26.276 line:82%
-What?
-What, what?

1038
01:38:27.152 --> 01:38:29.029 line:82%
Let's pack and leave quietly.

1039
01:38:30.363 --> 01:38:34.618 line:82%
Kabir, you should leave first.
You'll be in a lot of trouble otherwise.

1040
01:38:35.577 --> 01:38:36.411 line:82%
Relax, Ali.

1041
01:38:36.828 --> 01:38:42.542 line:82%
It's not the time to relax, let's run.
I know him better than all of you.

1042
01:38:42.792 --> 01:38:45.003 line:82%
He's mad. He will kill us all.

1043
01:38:45.086 --> 01:38:46.463 line:82%
He can't be of any danger to us alone.

1044
01:38:48.131 --> 01:38:49.716 line:82%
Don't underestimate him.

1045
01:38:49.883 --> 01:38:52.260 line:82%
-He's a hot headed guy.
-I don't give a damn!

1046
01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:02.854 line:82%
It's New Years Eve.
The whole world is here.

1047
01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:05.523 line:82%
It's possible that he is a guest.

1048
01:39:05.982 --> 01:39:10.528 line:82%
-Change of plans?
-No, Sheena.

1049
01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:16.159 line:82%
I've waited a full year for this.

1050
01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:20.997 line:82%
This is my plan. Mine.

1051
01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:23.792 line:82%
It won't change.

1052
01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.389 line:82%
I can pull this off myself.

1053
01:39:38.807 --> 01:39:41.351 line:82%
Anyone who isn't with me,
won't get a share either.

1054
01:40:16.386 --> 01:40:20.473 line:82%
Fiesta, Latina
It's driving wild

1055
01:40:20.557 --> 01:40:24.519 line:82%
Come salsa with me
It's party time

1056
01:40:24.602 --> 01:40:28.648 line:82%
Fiesta, Latina
It's driving wild

1057
01:40:28.732 --> 01:40:32.694 line:82%
Come salsa with me
It's party time

1058
01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:36.531 line:82%
Look, there's fun in the air

1059
01:40:36.614 --> 01:40:40.452 line:82%
It's now or never
This time won't come back

1060
01:40:40.827 --> 01:40:44.873 line:82%
Look, there's fun in the air

1061
01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:48.835 line:82%
It's now or never
This time won't come back

1062
01:40:48.918 --> 01:40:52.881 line:82%
To a new night and new conversations

1063
01:40:53.131 --> 01:40:57.093 line:82%
Let's welcome a new day

1064
01:40:57.177 --> 01:41:02.682 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1065
01:41:02.766 --> 01:41:05.268 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1066
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:10.815 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1067
01:41:10.899 --> 01:41:13.109 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1068
01:41:13.193 --> 01:41:17.280 line:82%
Look, there's fun in the air

1069
01:41:17.781 --> 01:41:21.409 line:82%
It's now or never
This time won't come back

1070
01:41:21.493 --> 01:41:25.497 line:82%
To a new night and new conversations

1071
01:41:25.622 --> 01:41:29.542 line:82%
Let's welcome a new day

1072
01:41:29.626 --> 01:41:35.006 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1073
01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:37.884 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1074
01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:43.389 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1075
01:41:43.473 --> 01:41:45.934 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1076
01:42:18.842 --> 01:42:22.595 line:82%
It's a wild, drunken night

1077
01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:26.307 line:82%
We're not in our senses anymore

1078
01:42:26.683 --> 01:42:30.854 line:82%
The Earth spins at our feet

1079
01:42:30.937 --> 01:42:34.482 line:82%
We're still young

1080
01:42:35.024 --> 01:42:39.153 line:82%
You'll have fun only as long
As you're young

1081
01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:42.949 line:82%
Listen to what I have to say

1082
01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:47.453 line:82%
These fun and games are short lived

1083
01:42:47.537 --> 01:42:50.623 line:82%
Don't get carried away

1084
01:42:50.748 --> 01:42:55.253 line:82%
To a new night and new conversations

1085
01:42:55.336 --> 01:42:59.257 line:82%
Let's welcome a new day

1086
01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:04.888 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1087
01:43:04.971 --> 01:43:07.473 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1088
01:43:07.557 --> 01:43:13.021 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1089
01:43:13.104 --> 01:43:16.065 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1090
01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:56.189 line:82%
Fiesta, Latina
It's driving wild

1091
01:43:56.272 --> 01:44:00.568 line:82%
Come salsa with me
It's party time

1092
01:44:00.652 --> 01:44:04.489 line:82%
We're carefree

1093
01:44:04.614 --> 01:44:07.784 line:82%
Nothing affects us

1094
01:44:08.618 --> 01:44:12.747 line:82%
Who knows when and where

1095
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:16.542 line:82%
This wild and carefree trip will end?

1096
01:44:16.793 --> 01:44:21.047 line:82%
We're crazy and unaware of this world

1097
01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:24.300 line:82%
We do as we please

1098
01:44:24.968 --> 01:44:27.178 line:82%
No matter what they hear

1099
01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:29.138 line:82%
No matter what they say

1100
01:44:29.222 --> 01:44:32.684 line:82%
We are fearless

1101
01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:36.938 line:82%
To a new night and new conversations

1102
01:44:37.021 --> 01:44:40.984 line:82%
Let's welcome a new day

1103
01:44:41.317 --> 01:44:46.656 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1104
01:44:46.739 --> 01:44:48.491 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1105
01:44:48.908 --> 01:44:54.414 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1106
01:44:54.497 --> 01:44:57.375 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1107
01:44:57.458 --> 01:45:03.089 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1108
01:45:03.172 --> 01:45:05.216 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1109
01:45:05.508 --> 01:45:10.888 line:82%
Come let's salute it, come let's salute it
Come let's salute it

1110
01:45:10.972 --> 01:45:13.725 line:82%
Come let's salute it

1111
01:45:17.478 --> 01:45:20.565 line:82%
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

1112
01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:29.490 line:82%
Prince, Mr. Prince, it's been a pleasure
to have you here.

1113
01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:31.659 line:82%
-Same here.
-Same to same.

1114
01:45:31.743 --> 01:45:34.287 line:82%
I hope everything was
all right. Privacy...

1115
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:35.496 line:82%
Yes.

1116
01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:36.456 line:82%
Your luggage.

1117
01:45:43.755 --> 01:45:46.466 line:82%
Congratulations, boys. We've done it.

1118
01:46:31.677 --> 01:46:32.720 line:82%
Like I said,

1119
01:46:33.513 --> 01:46:35.723 line:82%
we will definitely meet in the New Year.

1120
01:46:38.476 --> 01:46:39.685 line:82%
So Happy New Year.

1121
01:46:40.812 --> 01:46:43.231 line:82%
-Now what?
-Whatever you please.

1122
01:46:44.273 --> 01:46:46.776 line:82%
You can try and run if you like.

1123
01:46:46.943 --> 01:46:50.071 line:82%
I'll catch you, we'll fight.
Bloodshed and gore. Why?

1124
01:46:51.114 --> 01:46:53.407 line:82%
Or we can settle this amicably.

1125
01:46:54.242 --> 01:46:57.703 line:82%
Get in my car and then jail sweet jail.

1126
01:46:58.621 --> 01:46:59.455 line:82%
It's up to you.

1127
01:47:02.667 --> 01:47:03.501 line:82%
Let's walk.

1128
01:47:18.224 --> 01:47:21.144 line:82%
You're a good actor.

1129
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:25.606 line:82%
You're a good thief.

1130
01:47:25.898 --> 01:47:28.359 line:82%
Good is always two steps ahead of evil.

1131
01:47:29.986 --> 01:47:30.820 line:82%
You're good.

1132
01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.074 line:82%
If you were a thief, we'd be friends.

1133
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:43.624 line:82%
Kabir, you break my heart.

1134
01:47:44.584 --> 01:47:46.460 line:82%
I thought we were friends

1135
01:47:47.003 --> 01:47:48.796 line:82%
and that you would write to me
from prison.

1136
01:47:50.631 --> 01:47:51.799 line:82%
As a friend, can I say something?

1137
01:47:53.551 --> 01:47:54.552 line:82%
You caught me,

1138
01:47:55.803 --> 01:47:57.096 line:82%
but what about the money?

1139
01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:59.140 line:82%
You don't have the money.

1140
01:48:02.894 --> 01:48:03.728 line:82%
I do.

1141
01:48:07.315 --> 01:48:10.818 line:82%
As we speak, Ali is taking the cash
where it belongs.

1142
01:48:12.653 --> 01:48:13.487 line:82%
Nice, no?

1143
01:48:17.825 --> 01:48:18.659 line:82%
Oh, man.

1144
01:48:20.036 --> 01:48:22.163 line:82%
You're wasting time slogging
for the force.

1145
01:48:23.456 --> 01:48:24.498 line:82%
You are very good.

1146
01:48:25.875 --> 01:48:30.171 line:82%
Ali was with you. You planted him--

1147
01:48:31.672 --> 01:48:32.840 line:82%
I didn't.

1148
01:48:34.217 --> 01:48:35.426 line:82%
You did.

1149
01:48:40.514 --> 01:48:43.643 line:82%
That fight was a sham?

1150
01:48:45.978 --> 01:48:50.191 line:82%
He took real blows,
but looks like you got hurt.

1151
01:48:56.948 --> 01:49:02.745 line:82%
You knew that I would need a replacement
and would go to Ali?

1152
01:49:05.122 --> 01:49:06.624 line:82%
No, I hoped.

1153
01:49:09.126 --> 01:49:09.961 line:82%
Mindblowing.

1154
01:49:11.087 --> 01:49:12.964 line:82%
Ali and you.

1155
01:49:14.006 --> 01:49:14.840 line:82%
You got me, man.

1156
01:49:17.176 --> 01:49:20.346 line:82%
-The plan was perfect.
-Not "was."

1157
01:49:22.723 --> 01:49:24.016 line:82%
It is a perfect plan.

1158
01:49:25.935 --> 01:49:27.103 line:82%
One thing, Jai.

1159
01:49:30.898 --> 01:49:32.108 line:82%
Nothing is permanent.

1160
01:49:33.609 --> 01:49:36.195 line:82%
You, me.

1161
01:49:38.072 --> 01:49:41.993 line:82%
Neither the plan or time.

1162
01:49:52.336 --> 01:49:53.337 line:82%
See?

1163
01:49:53.504 --> 01:49:54.964 line:82%
Times are changing.

1164
01:49:58.759 --> 01:50:01.345 line:82%
D'Costa, happened to the lights?
Somebody check the lights.

1165
01:50:10.104 --> 01:50:11.230 line:82%
Run, Kabir.

1166
01:50:13.190 --> 01:50:14.025 line:82%
Run for your life.

1167
01:50:29.415 --> 01:50:30.750 line:82%
I must admit, sweetheart.

1168
01:50:32.251 --> 01:50:33.836 line:82%
There's a lot of money in this line.

1169
01:50:35.171 --> 01:50:36.464 line:82%
But respect? Not a shred.

1170
01:50:40.384 --> 01:50:41.218 line:82%
You fool.

1171
01:50:41.719 --> 01:50:45.139 line:82%
-Kabir won't spare you.
-Kabir has become mincemeat.

1172
01:50:45.723 --> 01:50:49.477 line:82%
You know Jai? He's a dangerous man.

1173
01:50:53.022 --> 01:50:55.232 line:82%
-For 3000 rupees, you--
-Sweetheart.

1174
01:50:55.566 --> 01:50:58.778 line:82%
The job was not just for the money.
I also get to wear a uniform.

1175
01:51:00.404 --> 01:51:03.824 line:82%
And working with Jai made me realize
how respectable this job is.

1176
01:51:04.867 --> 01:51:08.579 line:82%
Tomorrow when we get married,
even you can say with pride

1177
01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:10.498 line:82%
that your husband is in the police.

1178
01:51:12.124 --> 01:51:14.335 line:82%
Tell me you love me and run from here.

1179
01:51:15.336 --> 01:51:16.629 line:82%
I'm not going anywhere.

1180
01:51:18.381 --> 01:51:22.218 line:82%
And even if I run, I won't
come back to you.

1181
01:51:23.344 --> 01:51:27.890 line:82%
I'm sure you will! Ours is a match
made in heaven.

1182
01:51:28.391 --> 01:51:31.394 line:82%
My mother has even decided
the kids' names. Want to know?

1183
01:51:33.187 --> 01:51:35.981 line:82%
Here comes our children's uncle, Jai.

1184
01:51:53.332 --> 01:51:55.376 line:82%
Kabir, Happy New Year.

1185
01:51:55.960 --> 01:52:01.757 line:82%
Took you long enough.
I was just telling Sheena that

1186
01:52:02.258 --> 01:52:04.385 line:82%
you're very late. She's fast asleep.

1187
01:52:04.802 --> 01:52:05.803 line:82%
She got bored.

1188
01:52:09.432 --> 01:52:10.266 line:82%
What?

1189
01:52:10.349 --> 01:52:13.561 line:82%
Everyone warned me. I paid them no heed.

1190
01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:31.579 line:82%
For the first time I made an error
in judgment.

1191
01:52:34.039 --> 01:52:34.874 line:82%
First time.

1192
01:52:46.302 --> 01:52:50.764 line:82%
Sheena, I guess you hate him the most.

1193
01:53:11.285 --> 01:53:16.707 line:82%
Sweetheart. You'll kill me?

1194
01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:47.154 line:82%
Kabir, not here. Let's move out.

1195
01:53:48.405 --> 01:53:49.615 line:82%
Come on, Sheena.

1196
01:53:49.698 --> 01:53:52.117 line:82%
-Come on, let's go.
-Rahul, she won't come.

1197
01:54:01.544 --> 01:54:05.172 line:82%
Sweetheart, those guys left.

1198
01:54:07.258 --> 01:54:08.884 line:82%
You don't want to?

1199
01:54:23.399 --> 01:54:26.151 line:82%
Now I'm feeling a bit relaxed.

1200
01:54:27.403 --> 01:54:30.239 line:82%
Ali, come on, Ali.

1201
01:54:30.322 --> 01:54:31.740 line:82%
-Let's go!
-Now?

1202
01:54:32.199 --> 01:54:33.492 line:82%
Ali, let's go.

1203
01:54:33.659 --> 01:54:35.452 line:82%
I'm not moving from here.

1204
01:54:35.536 --> 01:54:36.370 line:82%
Ali, come on.

1205
01:54:40.207 --> 01:54:41.709 line:82%
Didn't I tell you he's crazy?

1206
01:54:44.753 --> 01:54:45.921 line:82%
I'll be right back.

1207
01:54:48.549 --> 01:54:51.427 line:82%
Sweetheart, don't vanish again.

1208
01:54:54.847 --> 01:54:55.681 line:82%
Come on, Ali.

1209
01:55:13.282 --> 01:55:18.203 line:82%
Yes, thank you, very okay.

1210
01:55:19.955 --> 01:55:21.290 line:82%
Your timing is amazing!

1211
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:24.960 line:82%
For the first time my love life
was looking up and you interrupted.

1212
01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:27.796 line:82%
-I could have been shot.
-Were you?

1213
01:55:28.005 --> 01:55:31.050 line:82%
Where were you when they were
beating me up?

1214
01:55:32.885 --> 01:55:36.472 line:82%
-I did save you, right?
-That was luck and my mother's blessings.

1215
01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.890 line:82%
Thank you, Mommy.

1216
01:55:37.973 --> 01:55:40.142 line:82%
-You didn't get shot at.
-But what if I did?

1217
01:55:40.225 --> 01:55:41.602 line:82%
I would have been a martyr.

1218
01:55:41.769 --> 01:55:43.604 line:82%
My photo would have been framed
and hung in the police station.

1219
01:55:44.396 --> 01:55:48.442 line:82%
-Police station?
-I'm a cop, right?

1220
01:55:50.194 --> 01:55:53.155 line:82%
Till we catch them, you're just Ali.
Understood?

1221
01:55:54.490 --> 01:55:57.993 line:82%
-I'm dying for no reason?
-Are you dead?

1222
01:55:58.369 --> 01:56:00.496 line:82%
No, but I'm done with this.

1223
01:56:00.579 --> 01:56:02.122 line:82%
My life is in danger. I'm out.

1224
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:03.874 line:82%
You know how to swim?

1225
01:56:06.585 --> 01:56:08.629 line:82%
I'll leave when we're on land.

1226
01:56:09.213 --> 01:56:12.925 line:82%
-Take me ashore.
-There they are.

1227
01:57:10.107 --> 01:57:11.650 line:82%
What are you trying to do?

1228
01:57:58.197 --> 01:57:59.031 line:82%
Ali.

1229
01:58:05.287 --> 01:58:07.456 line:82%
Hold on!

1230
01:58:17.216 --> 01:58:18.383 line:82%
What an idiot.

1231
01:58:18.467 --> 01:58:20.302 line:82%
This is meant to be driven in water.

1232
01:58:38.946 --> 01:58:40.447 line:82%
Fast, fast.

1233
01:58:45.702 --> 01:58:46.578 line:82%
Faster, Kabir!

1234
01:58:46.662 --> 01:58:48.747 line:82%
Faster, Jai. Overtake him.

1235
01:59:24.157 --> 01:59:25.117 line:82%
Drive.

1236
02:00:30.974 --> 02:00:31.808 line:82%
Come on!

1237
02:02:24.755 --> 02:02:26.089 line:82%
Jai, brother.

1238
02:02:26.173 --> 02:02:27.466 line:82%
You? All okay?

1239
02:02:27.549 --> 02:02:29.634 line:82%
You're blocking my view.

1240
02:02:29.718 --> 02:02:34.139 line:82%
Why aren't you stopping? Stop.

1241
02:02:34.306 --> 02:02:36.016 line:82%
I made a mistake. Sorry.

1242
02:02:38.101 --> 02:02:39.269 line:82%
Sorry, Jai.

1243
02:02:39.352 --> 02:02:42.022 line:82%
This was fun to drive. I got carried--

1244
02:02:42.105 --> 02:02:43.607 line:82%
-You couldn't see?
-No, I--

1245
02:02:43.690 --> 02:02:44.524 line:82%
I was dangling!

1246
02:04:00.016 --> 02:04:02.644 line:82%
I told you, you're a thief.

1247
02:04:02.727 --> 02:04:04.771 line:82%
You run and I catch you.

1248
02:04:05.105 --> 02:04:06.439 line:82%
And like I said,

1249
02:04:07.357 --> 02:04:11.361 line:82%
I'll walk right past you
and you'll have no clue.

1250
02:05:04.372 --> 02:05:05.582 line:82%
What a waste of life.

1251
02:05:08.126 --> 02:05:12.756 line:82%
If you weren't a thief,
we would be friends.

1252
02:05:19.679 --> 02:05:21.806 line:82%
Now, I'm a policeman, right?

1253
02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:22.933 line:82%
We'll see.

1254
02:05:25.727 --> 02:05:27.103 line:82%
What does that mean?

1255
02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:30.982 line:82%
Even I should get a chance
to make a decent living.

1256
02:05:31.066 --> 02:05:31.983 line:82%
I said we'll see.

1257
02:05:32.901 --> 02:05:35.320 line:82%
Sub Inspector or Inspector?
Who's higher up?

1258
02:05:36.363 --> 02:05:37.405 line:82%
You'll find out soon enough.

1259
02:05:38.073 --> 02:05:42.535 line:82%
-Please don't send Sheena to jail.
-Why? Didn't she steal?

1260
02:05:42.786 --> 02:05:46.790 line:82%
She's going to marry a police officer,
so she should get a discount, no?

1261
02:05:47.499 --> 02:05:52.796 line:82%
-Yes, we'll put her in a women's cell.
-I need to be posted there only.
