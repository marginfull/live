00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.706 line:83%
It looks like the storm has passed, New Yorkers.

2
00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.625 line:83%
A season-high seven inches of rain last night.

3
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.669 line:83%
High winds and flooding in some areas...

4
00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.755 line:83%
even left some New Yorkers stranded.

5
00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.673 line:83%
City crews still working this morning.

6
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.676 line:83%
They're trying to restore power to
several areas in the boroughs.

7
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.138 line:83%
Good news is, today should be sunny
with highs in the low 60s...

8
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.307 line:83%
unseasonably mild...

9
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.685 line:83%
a real change from the relentless
weather of these past few weeks.

10
00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.272 line:83%
So get out there, enjoy the sun,
go to the park, get outside if you can...

11
00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.357 line:83%
because it's not gonna last long.

12
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.359 line:83%
Winter storms are turning later in the week...

13
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.571 line:83%
making for a severe temperature drop over the weekend.

14
00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.616 line:83%
Could be signs for an early
and potentially long winter.

15
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.850 line:83%
What are you doing, John?

16
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.644 line:83%
Looking at you.

17
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.688 line:83%
Come here.

18
00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.446 line:83%
Are you still filming?

19
00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.117 line:83%
Just an anniversary.

20
00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.760 line:83%
It's been a while.

21
00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.722 line:83%
My condolences.

22
00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:08.933 line:83%
How are you holding up?

23
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.812 line:83%
I keep asking, "Why her?"

24
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.190 line:83%
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.

25
00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.652 line:83%
It's days like today scattered among the rest.

26
00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.196 line:83%
Are you sure?

27
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.365 line:83%
Don't blame yourself.

28
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.329 line:83%
What are you really doing here, Marcus?

29
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.543 line:83%
Just checkin' up on an old friend.

30
00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.053 line:83%
Good-bye, John.

31
00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.087 line:83%
- John Wick?
- Yes.

32
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.755 line:83%
Sign here, please.

33
00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.722 line:83%
And the pen.

34
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:31.849 line:83%
Sorry.

35
00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.185 line:83%
- Here you go. Good night.
- Thanks.

36
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.052 line:83%
"John, I'm sorry I can't be there for you.

37
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.556 line:83%
But you still need something, someone to love.

38
00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:14.142 line:83%
So start with this.

39
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:17.228 line:83%
Because the car doesn't count.

40
00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:19.147 line:83%
I love you, John.

41
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.482 line:83%
This illness has loomed over us for a long time...

42
00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:25.069 line:83%
and now that I have found my peace, find yours.

43
00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:29.323 line:83%
Until that day, your best friend, Helen. "

44
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.486 line:83%
Hey.

45
00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.366 line:83%
Hey.

46
00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.623 line:83%
Daisy.

47
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.709 line:83%
Of course.

48
00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.548 line:83%
Hey.

49
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.722 line:83%
Come on.

50
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.332 line:83%
I'm up. I'm up.

51
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.752 line:83%
I'm u- I'm up.

52
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.438 line:83%
Hey.

53
00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:28.609 line:83%
Oh. Right.

54
00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:43.291 line:83%
What?

55
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.636 line:83%
We'll grab you some kibble later.

56
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.038 line:83%
Is this true?

57
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.727 line:83%
Nice ride.

58
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.565 line:83%
Mustang. Boss 429.

59
00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.528 line:83%
- She a '70?
- '69.

60
00:11:37.571 --> 00:11:40.074 line:83%
- Beautiful car.
- Thanks.

61
00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.413 line:83%
- How much?
- Excuse me?

62
00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:47.748 line:83%
How much for the car?

63
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.584 line:83%
She's not for sale.

64
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:55.464 line:83%
Oh, I love dogs.

65
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.728 line:83%
You have good day, sir.

66
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.987 line:83%
All right. Come on, then.

67
00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:47.368 line:83%
How you doin'?

68
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:06.178 line:83%
You need to go?

69
00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:50.347 line:83%
Uh-huh.

70
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.258 line:83%
Yo, Aurelio!

71
00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:54.221 line:83%
Huh? I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.

72
00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:57.307 line:83%
Where'd you get that car?

73
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.403 line:83%
Is it here?

74
00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.749 line:83%
It was.

75
00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:08.629 line:83%
- I asked you where the hell did you get it?
- Who gives a shit?

76
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.632 line:83%
losef Tarasov nicked it.

77
00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:13.634 line:83%
Viggo's son.

78
00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:16.970 line:83%
Yeah.

79
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.267 line:83%
Get out of my shop. Get out right now.

80
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.687 line:83%
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?
Because we own you.

81
00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:33.862 line:83%
What did you say? What did you say to me?

82
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:35.447 line:83%
We own you.

83
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.492 line:83%
You don't own me, punk.

84
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:40.619 line:83%
I work with your father. All right?

85
00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:44.957 line:83%
The owner of that car, did you kill him or what?

86
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.083 line:83%
No.

87
00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:48.794 line:83%
We sure as hell fucked up his dog.

88
00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:51.338 line:83%
You fucked up his dog? That's what you did?

89
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.048 line:83%
Yeah.

90
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:54.842 line:83%
That's crazy shit, man.

91
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.974 line:83%
Oh, look at you. That's great.

92
00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:04.351 line:83%
You're gonna come into
my shop and pull a gun on me.

93
00:19:04.434 --> 00:19:06.937 line:83%
That's great, man. Come on.

94
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.647 line:83%
Now, you kill me right now...

95
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.025 line:83%
or you get the fuck out of my shop.

96
00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:17.364 line:83%
Viggo is not gonna like this.

97
00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:20.284 line:83%
How do you know what Viggo likes or doesn't like?

98
00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:22.703 line:83%
I'll tell you somethin' he's gonna understand.

99
00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:29.042 line:83%
You've got a fuckin' pair on you, old man!

100
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.506 line:83%
I guess we'll be takin' our business someplace else.

101
00:19:38.176 --> 00:19:39.553 line:83%
So what are you gonna do?

102
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.400 line:83%
I need a ride.

103
00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:09.416 line:83%
Aurelio speaking.

104
00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:14.087 line:83%
I heard you struck my son.

105
00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:18.091 line:83%
- Yes, sir, I did.
- And may I ask why?

106
00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:21.720 line:83%
Yeah, well, because he stole John Wick's car, sir...

107
00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:25.223 line:83%
and, uh, killed his dog.

108
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.772 line:83%
Oh.

109
00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.636 line:83%
Viggo.

110
00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:04.054 line:83%
Yeah?

111
00:21:04.137 --> 00:21:05.973 line:83%
They've agreed to your terms.

112
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:10.560 line:83%
It's not like you gave them much
of a choice anyway though, right?

113
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.272 line:83%
Congratulations.

114
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.069 line:83%
Sir?

115
00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:23.657 line:83%
Have you seen my son?

116
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:42.634 line:83%
How was your trip, kid?

117
00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:45.178 line:83%
We won't be hearing from them anytime soon.

118
00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:46.763 line:83%
Or ever.

119
00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.372 line:83%
That's a nice jacket.

120
00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:14.207 line:83%
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

121
00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:28.096 line:83%
Should I go?

122
00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:33.894 line:83%
- Viggo, English, please. Come on.
- Stay, goddamn it!

123
00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:36.146 line:83%
What did I do?

124
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:42.652 line:83%
We did what you asked.
No one saw shit.

125
00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:49.284 line:83%
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.

126
00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:52.162 line:83%
What then?

127
00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:55.415 line:83%
You mean Aurelio's? So I stole a fucking car!

128
00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:56.833 line:83%
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

129
00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:58.752 line:83%
- Christ, Viggo.
- You stay!

130
00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:22.901 line:83%
It's not what you did, son, that angers me so.

131
00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:24.903 line:83%
It's who you did it to.

132
00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:27.614 line:83%
Who? That fucking nobody?

133
00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:31.451 line:83%
That "fuckin' nobody"...

134
00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:34.955 line:83%
is John Wick.

135
00:23:50.178 --> 00:23:52.889 line:83%
He once was an associate of ours.

136
00:23:54.808 --> 00:23:57.060 line:83%
They call him Baba Yaga.

137
00:24:00.063 --> 00:24:01.398 line:83%
The boogeyman?

138
00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:03.608 line:83%
Well, John wasn't exactly
the boogeyman.

139
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:11.658 line:83%
He was the one you sent to kill the fucking boogeyman.

140
00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:17.247 line:83%
Oh.

141
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.000 line:83%
John is a man of focus...

142
00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:22.335 line:83%
commitment...

143
00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:24.462 line:83%
sheer will.

144
00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:28.675 line:83%
Something you know very little about.

145
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.930 line:83%
I once saw him kill three men in a bar...

146
00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:35.182 line:83%
with a pencil.

147
00:24:36.766 --> 00:24:38.018 line:83%
With a fuckin'...

148
00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:42.814 line:83%
pencil.

149
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.867 line:83%
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

150
00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:57.370 line:83%
It's over a woman, of course.

151
00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:05.170 line:83%
So I made a deal with him.

152
00:25:06.463 --> 00:25:10.342 line:83%
I gave him an impossible task.

153
00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:14.679 line:83%
A job no one could have pulled off.

154
00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:23.855 line:83%
The bodies he buried that day...

155
00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:28.151 line:83%
laid the foundation of what we are now.

156
00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:34.199 line:83%
And then, my son...

157
00:25:35.242 --> 00:25:37.869 line:83%
a few days after his wife died...

158
00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:40.413 line:83%
you steal his car...

159
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.376 line:83%
and kill his fuckin' dog.

160
00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:47.420 line:83%
Father, I can make this right.

161
00:25:47.504 --> 00:25:50.507 line:83%
Oh. How do you plan that?

162
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.300 line:83%
By finishing what I started.

163
00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:54.052 line:83%
Did he hear a fucking word I said?

164
00:25:57.013 --> 00:25:59.557 line:83%
losef, My son.

165
00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:04.771 line:83%
John will come for you.

166
00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:12.195 line:83%
And you will do nothing...

167
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.281 line:83%
because you can do nothing.

168
00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:17.033 line:83%
So get the fuck out of my sight.

169
00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:47.731 line:83%
Hello, John.

170
00:26:50.817 --> 00:26:53.069 line:83%
I heard about your wife,
and I'm sorry.

171
00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:54.654 line:83%
My condolences.

172
00:26:57.157 --> 00:27:01.244 line:83%
It seems to be fate, or happenstance...

173
00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:05.415 line:83%
or just bad fuckin' luck caused
our paths to cross once again.

174
00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:11.671 line:83%
John?

175
00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:18.928 line:83%
Let us not resort to our baser instincts...

176
00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:21.598 line:83%
and handle this like civilized men...

177
00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:23.433 line:83%
to move on-

178
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:35.779 line:83%
What'd he say?

179
00:27:38.365 --> 00:27:40.533 line:83%
- Enough.
- Oh, God.

180
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:46.206 line:83%
Task a crew.

181
00:27:47.624 --> 00:27:48.958 line:83%
H- How many?

182
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:51.544 line:83%
How many do you have?

183
00:32:01.377 --> 00:32:02.712 line:83%
Evenin', John.

184
00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:04.881 line:83%
Evenin', Jimmy.

185
00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:06.591 line:83%
Noise complaint?

186
00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.677 line:83%
Noise complaint.

187
00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:24.400 line:83%
- You, uh, workin' again?
- No, just sortin' some stuff out.

188
00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:27.362 line:83%
Ah, well...

189
00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:32.450 line:83%
I'll leave you be then.

190
00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:35.036 line:83%
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Jimmy.

191
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:53.179 line:83%
This is Wick.

192
00:32:53.262 --> 00:32:55.431 line:83%
Yes, John Wick. That's right.

193
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:58.685 line:83%
I'd like to make a dinner reservation for 12.

194
00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:19.455 line:83%
Good to see you, John.

195
00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.082 line:83%
Charlie.

196
00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:35.805 line:83%
You look good.

197
00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:38.933 line:83%
And here I'd feared you'd left all this behind.

198
00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:24.020 line:83%
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?

199
00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:27.398 line:83%
Good-bye, Charlie.

200
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:29.442 line:83%
John.

201
00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.406 line:83%
Of course he did.

202
00:34:37.116 --> 00:34:39.202 line:83%
Put a contract on John Wick.

203
00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:40.912 line:83%
How much?

204
00:34:40.995 --> 00:34:43.039 line:83%
Two million.

205
00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:51.964 line:83%
English, Viggo, please.

206
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:59.680 line:83%
Put losef in the Red Circle and wait.

207
00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:02.767 line:83%
For what?

208
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.603 line:83%
For John Wick, of course.

209
00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:32.088 line:83%
Thank you.

210
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:36.634 line:83%
To what do I owe this visit?

211
00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:43.140 line:83%
I have a job for you.

212
00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:44.851 line:83%
And I've got a phone.

213
00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:49.772 line:83%
I want to offer you this face to face...

214
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:54.360 line:83%
seeing as how you might find it personal.

215
00:35:56.028 --> 00:35:58.698 line:83%
Would you kill John Wick for two million dollars?

216
00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:05.037 line:83%
After all, you were close.

217
00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:10.167 line:83%
- Is the contract exclusive?
- No, it's open.

218
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:13.254 line:83%
It's a timely matter. It has to be handled quickly.

219
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.840 line:83%
Consider it done.

220
00:36:17.383 --> 00:36:20.511 line:83%
Thank you, Marcus.
I know I can trust you.

221
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:22.221 line:83%
Thanks for the drink.

222
00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:28.597 line:83%
Room 918. Do enjoy your stay.

223
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:30.307 line:83%
Thanks.

224
00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:34.020 line:83%
Good seeing you again, John.

225
00:38:34.895 --> 00:38:36.397 line:83%
Perkins.

226
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:41.110 line:83%
I have you for two nights.

227
00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:43.988 line:83%
- Depending on business, it may be more.
- Of course, sir.

228
00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:48.159 line:83%
So when did the old place get a face lift?

229
00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:49.702 line:83%
Around four years ago.

230
00:38:49.785 --> 00:38:51.120 line:83%
But I assure you, sir...

231
00:38:51.203 --> 00:38:53.122 line:83%
she really hasn't changed much.

232
00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:55.875 line:83%
- Same owner?
- Same owner.

233
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:05.217 line:83%
Room 818.

234
00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:08.512 line:83%
And, as always...

235
00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:11.057 line:83%
it is a pleasure...

236
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.685 line:83%
having you with us again, Mr. Wick.

237
00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.869 line:83%
What are you doing, John?

238
00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:34.413 line:83%
Looking at you.

239
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:36.916 line:83%
Come here.

240
00:41:09.675 --> 00:41:11.469 line:83%
Hello, Winston.

241
00:41:13.387 --> 00:41:14.930 line:83%
Jonathan.

242
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:19.101 line:83%
Now, as I recall...

243
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:23.439 line:83%
weren't you the one tasked to dole out
the beatings, not receive them?

244
00:41:23.522 --> 00:41:25.107 line:83%
Rusty, I guess.

245
00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:27.860 line:83%
To what do we owe the pleasure?

246
00:41:29.528 --> 00:41:31.530 line:83%
losef Tarasov.

247
00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:35.367 line:83%
- What about him?
- I'd like to talk with him.

248
00:41:36.076 --> 00:41:39.163 line:83%
A talk, you say.

249
00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:44.293 line:83%
I'm familiar with the parlance, Jonathan.

250
00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:47.630 line:83%
I want to ask you this.

251
00:41:47.713 --> 00:41:49.715 line:83%
Have you returned to the fold?

252
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:53.135 line:83%
Just visiting.

253
00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:55.262 line:83%
Have you thought this through?

254
00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:59.225 line:83%
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

255
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.728 line:83%
You got out once.

256
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:05.814 line:83%
You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond...

257
00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:10.778 line:83%
you may well find something reaches out...

258
00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:13.322 line:83%
and drags you back into its depths.

259
00:42:13.405 --> 00:42:15.449 line:83%
Where do I find him?

260
00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:21.163 line:83%
Hey. Wick's at the Continental.

261
00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:25.501 line:83%
Welcome home, John.

262
00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:28.420 line:83%
We have a contact there who's
willing to take him out for us.

263
00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:30.130 line:83%
Yeah?

264
00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:32.967 line:83%
How brazen.

265
00:42:35.427 --> 00:42:39.223 line:83%
If they're willing to break the rules
of Continental, double the bounty.

266
00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:41.684 line:83%
You know the rules.

267
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:44.019 line:83%
No business can be conducted on these premises...

268
00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:47.940 line:83%
lest incurring heavy penalties.

269
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.403 line:83%
Have a drink...

270
00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:56.115 line:83%
and relax...

271
00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:00.494 line:83%
for now.

272
00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:05.332 line:83%
It's personal.

273
00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:11.505 line:83%
I want caviar for breakfast and champagne every night

274
00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:14.049 line:83%
Holy shit. Jonathan.

275
00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:16.093 line:83%
- Hey, Addy.
- My God!

276
00:43:16.176 --> 00:43:19.096 line:83%
How long has it been? Four years?

277
00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:20.472 line:83%
Five and change.

278
00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:24.435 line:83%
So tell me, how was life on the other side?

279
00:43:24.518 --> 00:43:26.395 line:83%
It was good, Addy.

280
00:43:26.478 --> 00:43:28.522 line:83%
Far better than I deserved.

281
00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:31.608 line:83%
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your-

282
00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:33.277 line:83%
Thanks.

283
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.072 line:83%
I've never seen you like this.

284
00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:38.490 line:83%
Like what?

285
00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:41.118 line:83%
Vulnerable.

286
00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.496 line:83%
I'm retired.

287
00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:47.082 line:83%
Not if you're drinkin' here, you're not.

288
00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:50.669 line:83%
- Usual?
- Please.

289
00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:53.505 line:83%
But I'll empty your pockets

290
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:56.091 line:83%
Leave you in misery

291
00:43:57.176 --> 00:44:00.095 line:83%
- Compliments of the house.
- Thanks.

292
00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:02.181 line:83%
"I'll empty your pockets"

293
00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:06.685 line:83%
"Leave you in misery."

294
00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:13.020 line:83%
Did you see the tits on that girl?

295
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.648 line:83%
I hope Lita is working tonight.

296
00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:35.250 line:83%
Are you scared of the
fuckin' boogeyman?

297
00:46:35.334 --> 00:46:37.336 line:83%
- I'm not.
- No?

298
00:46:38.504 --> 00:46:40.756 line:83%
But you should be.

299
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.386 line:83%
I want another bottle!

300
00:46:48.263 --> 00:46:51.517 line:83%
Right fuckin' now! Go get me a bottle!

301
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.185 line:83%
Come on!

302
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.153 line:83%
Hello, Francis.

303
00:47:04.029 --> 00:47:05.656 line:83%
Mr. Wick.

304
00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:15.290 line:83%
Are you here on business, sir?

305
00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:17.834 line:83%
Afraid so, Francis.

306
00:47:18.877 --> 00:47:21.547 line:83%
Why don't you take the night off.

307
00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:28.303 line:83%
Thank you, sir.

308
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:01.003 line:83%
Fuck you, motherfucker.

309
00:48:07.634 --> 00:48:09.761 line:83%
Where is losef?

310
00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.766 line:83%
Bathhouse, downstairs.

311
00:50:18.223 --> 00:50:19.891 line:83%
Go!

312
00:51:48.688 --> 00:51:52.609 line:83%
Move! He's here! He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!

313
00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:34.461 line:83%
Get in! Get in!

314
00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:36.588 line:83%
Come on! Come on!

315
00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:23.361 line:83%
Good evening, Mr. Wick.

316
00:55:23.445 --> 00:55:24.612 line:83%
Good evening.

317
00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:26.072 line:83%
How may I be of service?

318
00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:29.075 line:83%
- Is the doctor in?
- Yes, sir. 24/7.

319
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:31.036 line:83%
- Send him up, please.
- Yes, sir.

320
00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:32.620 line:83%
How good's your laundry?

321
00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:37.459 line:83%
I'm sorry to say that no one's that good.

322
00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:40.920 line:83%
No. I thought not.

323
00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:43.840 line:83%
May I suggest a drink, sir.

324
00:55:43.923 --> 00:55:45.425 line:83%
Bourbon, perhaps.

325
00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:48.553 line:83%
That sounds perfect.

326
00:56:02.817 --> 00:56:05.278 line:83%
So what sort of movement am I looking at?

327
00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.989 line:83%
Well, if you're lookin' to heal...

328
00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:09.574 line:83%
then keep it marginal.

329
00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:13.995 line:83%
However, if you still have...

330
00:56:14.079 --> 00:56:15.747 line:83%
business to attend to...

331
00:56:18.583 --> 00:56:20.919 line:83%
take two of these beforehand.

332
00:56:22.128 --> 00:56:25.715 line:83%
Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed...

333
00:56:25.799 --> 00:56:28.510 line:83%
but you'll have full function.

334
00:56:28.593 --> 00:56:30.512 line:83%
Do you need anything for the pain?

335
00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:34.224 line:83%
No, I've got that covered.

336
00:57:41.166 --> 00:57:42.167 line:83%
Hey, John.

337
00:57:45.587 --> 00:57:48.339 line:83%
- Perkins?
- I thought I'd let myself in.

338
00:57:49.716 --> 00:57:51.593 line:83%
I noticed.

339
00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:01.853 line:83%
I never knew Ms. Perkins to get
out of bed for less than three.

340
00:58:01.936 --> 00:58:03.771 line:83%
Viggo's giving me four to break hotel rules.

341
00:58:03.855 --> 00:58:06.316 line:83%
That's unwise, I assure you.

342
00:58:12.447 --> 00:58:14.199 line:83%
You were always a pussy.

343
00:59:30.108 --> 00:59:31.025 line:83%
Yes?

344
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:34.112 line:83%
I apologize for calling you at this hour...

345
00:59:34.195 --> 00:59:37.949 line:83%
but we have received a number
of grievances from your floor...

346
00:59:38.032 --> 00:59:39.617 line:83%
concerning the noise.

347
00:59:41.786 --> 00:59:43.079 line:83%
My apologies.

348
00:59:43.162 --> 00:59:47.000 line:83%
I was dealing with an uninvited guest.

349
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.876 line:83%
Have you need then of, say...

350
00:59:49.377 --> 00:59:51.087 line:83%
a dinner reservation, perhaps?

351
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:54.465 line:83%
Perhaps. I'll have to get back to you.

352
01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:03.975 line:83%
No! Aah!

353
01:00:04.058 --> 01:00:05.643 line:83%
Where's losef?

354
01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.061 line:83%
Fuck you.

355
01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:09.814 line:83%
- Where's Viggo?
- I'm not telling you shit!

356
01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:13.192 line:83%
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?

357
01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:16.654 line:83%
Give me somethin'.

358
01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.076 line:83%
Little Russia.

359
01:00:22.618 --> 01:00:24.954 line:83%
There's a church near Cannon Court.

360
01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.832 line:83%
- What about it?
- It's a front.

361
01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:30.335 line:83%
It's where Viggo keeps his private stash.

362
01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:33.504 line:83%
Thank you.

363
01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:42.347 line:83%
Do I know you?

364
01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.767 line:83%
I'm thinkin' so.

365
01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:54.108 line:83%
Hey, John.

366
01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:55.943 line:83%
Hey, Harry.

367
01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.612 line:83%
Everything all right?

368
01:00:57.695 --> 01:01:00.573 line:83%
Yeah. Everything's fine.

369
01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:04.702 line:83%
- I'll leave you to it then.
- Hey, Harry.

370
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.749 line:83%
You keen on earning a coin?
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?

371
01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:12.668 line:83%
- Catch and release?
- Catch and release.

372
01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:46.702 line:83%
My son, how might I help you?

373
01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.085 line:83%
Motherfucker!

374
01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:07.306 line:83%
Let's go to the vault.

375
01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:19.986 line:83%
Open it.

376
01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:28.619 line:83%
Viggo will kill me.

377
01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:35.293 line:83%
Uh-huh.

378
01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:48.306 line:83%
Ladies, out.

379
01:03:01.068 --> 01:03:05.156 line:83%
Honestly, what do you think
you're going to do with all of that?

380
01:03:05.239 --> 01:03:07.492 line:83%
This.

381
01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:56.874 line:83%
Don't worry.

382
01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.961 line:83%
Housekeeping will find you.

383
01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:03.005 line:83%
Treat all your ladies like this?

384
01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:06.300 line:83%
You are no lady. Trust me.

385
01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:15.226 line:83%
Harry, is it?

386
01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:20.231 line:83%
How would you like to earn more than just a gold coin?

387
01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:24.569 line:83%
You've broken the rules.

388
01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.655 line:83%
You've done business on Continental grounds.

389
01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:31.242 line:83%
And management does not take kindly...

390
01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:33.411 line:83%
to that sort of behavior.

391
01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:37.081 line:83%
Fuck management.

392
01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.715 line:83%
Don't worry. Housekeeping'll find you.

393
01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:53.931 line:83%
Ashes to ashes.

394
01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.726 line:83%
Can we recover from this?

395
01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:59.395 line:83%
Viggo, you know what was
in that vault, right?

396
01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:05.943 line:83%
Shit.

397
01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:24.295 line:83%
Come on!

398
01:06:41.622 --> 01:06:44.417 line:83%
I'll say this, John.

399
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.378 line:83%
They sure as fuck broke
the mold with you.

400
01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:03.060 line:83%
You always had a certain...

401
01:07:04.895 --> 01:07:06.856 line:83%
audacity about you, you know.

402
01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:10.067 line:83%
Yeah.

403
01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:18.242 line:83%
I can say you're still very much the John Wick of old.

404
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.745 line:83%
Am I?

405
01:07:23.914 --> 01:07:27.668 line:83%
People don't change. You know that.

406
01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.879 line:83%
Times, they do.

407
01:07:33.674 --> 01:07:36.886 line:83%
Do you know what was in that vault?

408
01:07:36.969 --> 01:07:39.013 line:83%
Artwork, cash, not without its worth.

409
01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:41.557 line:83%
But the leverage I had on this city-

410
01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.644 line:83%
audio recordings, physical evidence, blackmail-

411
01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.271 line:83%
it was fuckin' priceless!

412
01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:49.774 line:83%
Priceless!

413
01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:55.112 line:83%
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

414
01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:57.031 line:83%
Yeah.

415
01:07:57.114 --> 01:08:00.117 line:83%
Yeah, I know you did. Yeah.

416
01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.870 line:83%
Are you really laughing?

417
01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.462 line:83%
So-

418
01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:17.927 line:83%
Ah, then you got married, huh? Settled down.

419
01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:20.846 line:83%
How did you manage that anyways?

420
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.306 line:83%
Luck, I guess.

421
01:08:23.307 --> 01:08:25.518 line:83%
Yeah.

422
01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:28.562 line:83%
Yeah, while you had your wife, I had my son.

423
01:08:28.646 --> 01:08:31.816 line:83%
And believe me,
you had a far better deal.

424
01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:38.572 line:83%
And then you left.

425
01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:41.075 line:83%
And the way you got out...

426
01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:46.497 line:83%
lying to yourself that the past
held no sway over the future.

427
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.332 line:83%
But in the end...

428
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.755 line:83%
a lot of us are rewarded for our misdeeds...

429
01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:58.676 line:83%
which is why God took your wife...

430
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.805 line:83%
and unleashed you upon me.

431
01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.143 line:83%
This life...

432
01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:09.228 line:83%
follows you.

433
01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:13.482 line:83%
It clings to you...

434
01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:18.821 line:83%
infecting everyone who comes close to you.

435
01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.866 line:83%
We are cursed, you and I.

436
01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:26.704 line:83%
On that we agree.

437
01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:32.751 line:83%
Finally, common ground.

438
01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.462 line:83%
Okay.

439
01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.298 line:83%
Step aside.

440
01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:39.884 line:83%
Give me your son.

441
01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:42.177 line:83%
John Wick.

442
01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:51.312 line:83%
It was just a fucking car. Just a fuckin' dog.

443
01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:53.355 line:83%
Just a dog.

444
01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:56.150 line:83%
Viggo.

445
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.277 line:83%
- Yeah?

446
01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:01.030 line:83%
When Helen died,
I lost everything.

447
01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:05.326 line:83%
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep-

448
01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:08.245 line:83%
a final gift from my wife.

449
01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:12.416 line:83%
In that moment, I received some semblance of hope...

450
01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:17.588 line:83%
an opportunity to grieve unalloyed.

451
01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:22.009 line:83%
And your son...

452
01:10:22.092 --> 01:10:23.677 line:83%
took that from me.

453
01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:26.931 line:83%
- Oh, God.
- Stole that from me.

454
01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:29.767 line:83%
Killed that from me!

455
01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:32.353 line:83%
People keep asking if I'm back...

456
01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:35.105 line:83%
and I haven't really had an answer.

457
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:38.651 line:83%
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back.

458
01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.904 line:83%
So you can either hand over your son...

459
01:10:41.987 --> 01:10:45.115 line:83%
or you can die screaming alongside him!

460
01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:24.566 line:83%
Cool it. Cool it.

461
01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:26.985 line:83%
John!

462
01:13:28.612 --> 01:13:30.614 line:83%
- Aah! Jesus.
- Where is he?

463
01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:34.076 line:83%
Shit!

464
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:40.582 line:83%
I have your word then,
if I tell you where he is,

465
01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.043 line:83%
you'll let me walk away?

466
01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:44.461 line:83%
Pull the contract.

467
01:13:49.049 --> 01:13:50.092 line:83%
Done.

468
01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.850 line:83%
He's kept in a safe house. Brooklyn.

469
01:13:57.933 --> 01:14:00.811 line:83%
434 Wallace Place.

470
01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:05.107 line:83%
- They know you're coming.
- Of course.

471
01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:07.901 line:83%
But it won't matter.

472
01:14:59.536 --> 01:15:01.538 line:83%
Will you stop playing the fucking video game?

473
01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:17.888 line:83%
Will you stop playing that fucking video game?

474
01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.193 line:83%
Get down! Get down!

475
01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:42.663 line:83%
Come on! Come on!
Get down! Get down!

476
01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.285 line:83%
Make the arrangements.

477
01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.388 line:83%
Thank you.

478
01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.182 line:83%
Our pleasure, sir.

479
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:31.938 line:83%
A parting gift.
From the management.

480
01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:34.358 line:83%
Compensation for last night's unfortunate...

481
01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:37.527 line:83%
incident.

482
01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:27.327 line:83%
How many times do I have to save your ass?

483
01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:30.414 line:83%
- I appreciate it.
- Of course.

484
01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:32.499 line:83%
You look terrible.

485
01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:34.501 line:83%
No, I look retired.

486
01:18:34.584 --> 01:18:35.919 line:83%
Retired?

487
01:18:36.002 --> 01:18:38.088 line:83%
You really believe that?

488
01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:53.395 line:83%
You made a new life.

489
01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.941 line:83%
You'll find your way back to it.

490
01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:01.403 line:83%
It's time to go home.

491
01:19:54.998 --> 01:19:59.169 line:83%
Let's get on with this, whatever the fuck this is.

492
01:19:59.252 --> 01:20:00.795 line:83%
Hello, Marcus.

493
01:20:13.433 --> 01:20:14.684 line:83%
This is John.

494
01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:19.314 line:83%
I appreciate you granting my son a swift death.

495
01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:24.486 line:83%
I wouldn't know how to reply to that either.

496
01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:28.615 line:83%
Marcus betrayed me.

497
01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:41.628 line:83%
You pulled the contract.

498
01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:46.383 line:83%
And while it was open, you had every chance...

499
01:20:46.466 --> 01:20:49.636 line:83%
every opportunity to kill John Wick.

500
01:20:49.719 --> 01:20:52.973 line:83%
And if you had done your job...

501
01:20:53.056 --> 01:20:55.308 line:83%
my son would be still alive!

502
01:20:58.061 --> 01:20:59.646 line:83%
And in so doing...

503
01:20:59.729 --> 01:21:02.190 line:83%
he broke the cardinal rule.

504
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:05.402 line:83%
Thank you.

505
01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:09.990 line:83%
Ms. Perkins.

506
01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.827 line:83%
Why am I not surprised?

507
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:16.079 line:83%
In for a penny, in for a pound.

508
01:21:17.622 --> 01:21:21.084 line:83%
So, John, I had no choice.

509
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.379 line:83%
I always liked you, Marcus.

510
01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:27.882 line:83%
The last of the old guard.

511
01:21:36.766 --> 01:21:40.645 line:83%
But unlike the others, you go out on my terms.

512
01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:44.190 line:83%
No! No!

513
01:21:46.276 --> 01:21:48.111 line:83%
No, my good sir.

514
01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.615 line:83%
I go out on my own.

515
01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:14.304 line:83%
See?

516
01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:27.692 line:83%
Well played, old friend.

517
01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:37.661 line:83%
- We done, Viggo?
- We're done.

518
01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.121 line:83%
Okay. Here.

519
01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:41.790 line:83%
Thank you.

520
01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:47.420 line:83%
Yeah. Fuel the chopper.

521
01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:14.406 line:83%
Ms. Perkins, I apologize for calling you at this hour.

522
01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:59.033 line:83%
Ms. Perkins.

523
01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.745 line:83%
Your membership to the Continental has been...

524
01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:04.914 line:83%
by thine own hand, revoked.

525
01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:34.235 line:83%
I know what you're thinking, Jonathan.

526
01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:35.904 line:83%
We live by a code.

527
01:24:35.987 --> 01:24:37.655 line:83%
Which is why I'm not the one telling you that...

528
01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.657 line:83%
a certain helicopter at a certain helipad...

529
01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:42.410 line:83%
is being fueled for a certain someone.

530
01:25:01.387 --> 01:25:03.723 line:83%
- Have you got my cigarettes?
- Yeah, I got your cigarettes.

531
01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:28.581 line:83%
Oh, fuck!

532
01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:33.503 line:83%
Yeah. Super. Let's go. Faster!

533
01:25:33.586 --> 01:25:35.839 line:83%
The helicopter's right down there. Come on! Let's go!

534
01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:52.105 line:83%
Shit! Goddamn, I knew he'd come.

535
01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.121 line:83%
What's fuckin' wrong with this guy?

536
01:26:08.955 --> 01:26:10.832 line:83%
Somebody give me a gun. Who's got a gun?

537
01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:15.211 line:83%
Oh, God! My fucking head.

538
01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:18.965 line:83%
- That was a good one.
- Who's got a gun?

539
01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:37.108 line:83%
Fuck!

540
01:26:53.082 --> 01:26:55.919 line:83%
The helicopter's right over there.
We have to get over there.

541
01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:14.562 line:83%
I need a gun.

542
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.379 line:83%
- English, please.
- Good luck.

543
01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:42.966 line:83%
Russian cocksucker.

544
01:27:44.175 --> 01:27:45.468 line:83%
Fuck!

545
01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:12.495 line:83%
No!

546
01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:17.351 line:83%
No more guns, John.

547
01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.397 line:83%
No more bullets.

548
01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:24.275 line:83%
No more bullets.

549
01:29:32.241 --> 01:29:34.327 line:83%
Just you and me, John.

550
01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:36.245 line:83%
You and me.

551
01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:01.437 line:83%
What happened, John?

552
01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:04.899 line:83%
We were professionals. Civilized.

553
01:30:04.982 --> 01:30:07.110 line:83%
Do I look civilized to you?

554
01:31:30.067 --> 01:31:31.944 line:83%
Be seeing you, John.

555
01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:35.531 line:83%
Yeah.

556
01:31:36.532 --> 01:31:38.284 line:83%
Be seeing you.

557
01:32:29.418 --> 01:32:32.421 line:83%
Come on, John. Let's go home.

558
01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.527 line:83%
It's okay.

559
01:34:19.445 --> 01:34:20.696 line:83%
Let's go home.
