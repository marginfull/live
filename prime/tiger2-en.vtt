There's a calm before the storm.

11

I've never felt anything like this
in this city before.

12
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.970 line:82%
But something is wrong.
It feels as if...

13
00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:28.053 line:82%
...a terrifying event
is about to unfold.

14
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:30.595 line:82%
Something that'll change
the world forever.

15

We're sitting on a ticking
time bomb.

16
00:04:33.428 --> 00:04:35.303 line:82%
One that could blow
at any given time.

17
00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:38.595 line:82%
And they're coming. They're all
coming, dressed in black...

18
00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:42.173 line:82%
...and using faith as a cover
to protect their identities.

19
00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:43.220 line:82%
They are...

20
00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:49.136 line:82%

I'm a journalist.

23
00:05:05.303 --> 00:05:07.845 line:82%
And what kind of journalist
keeps a gun with him?

24
00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:12.198 line:82%
When will you Americans stop
thinking that...

25
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.511 line:82%
...we're not as stupid
as you think?

26
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:17.011 line:82%
Please. I'm just a journalist.

27
00:05:17.328 --> 00:05:19.470 line:82%
Why are you doing this to me?

28
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.428 line:82%
Let me tell you a story.

29
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:26.928 line:82%
Once Uncle Sam came to our land...

30
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:31.857 line:82%
...saying the Middle East needs
a new world order.

31
00:05:32.345 --> 00:05:36.928 line:82%
And the real reason behind it
was business and Imperialism.

32
00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:41.011 line:82%
For that, they hired a pack
of local wolves...

33
00:05:41.345 --> 00:05:44.345 line:82%
And made them break their
own countrymen.

34
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.105 line:82%
And when his job was done...

35
00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:55.636 line:82%
...he betrayed the pack leader
of all his promises.

36
00:05:56.178 --> 00:05:57.928 line:82%
And fled with the money...

37
00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:06.928 line:82%
I am that pack leader.

38
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.053 line:82%
And now I will hunt and take
control of my land.

39
00:06:16.303 --> 00:06:17.511 line:82%

No! One phone is for the family.

68
00:08:17.928 --> 00:08:21.053 line:82%
That reminds me. My brother
called from Pakistan.

69

They're going to Lahore from Pindi

71
00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:30.303 line:82%
Tell them to go to Delhi.

72
00:08:30.595 --> 00:08:34.011 line:82%
Contact Dr. Trehan at AIMS Hospital.
He's the best heart surgeon there.

73
00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:36.220 line:82%
I trained under him.

74
00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:39.314 line:82%
Tell your brother to get in touch
with AIMS. I'll see to the rest.

75
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.726 line:82%
- Really?
- Done.

- You go home and then what?

79
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.621 line:82%

00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:14.261 line:82%
Let's get to the hospital. Hurry!

100
00:10:18.303 --> 00:10:19.511 line:82%
Everyone, stay down!

101

Where's the doctor?

109
00:11:15.428 --> 00:11:18.451 line:82%
Open the door now! I kill you.

00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:20.593 line:82%
Only nurses in the bus.

111
00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:26.053 line:82%

00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:44.886 line:82%
Then shut up and work fast.

00:11:45.303 --> 00:11:47.716 line:82%
Ok. I'll do it.

118
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.136 line:82%
Get everyone out of this hospital.
Now!

119
00:11:52.553 --> 00:11:55.636 line:82%
Only Abu Usman and these nurses stay.

120
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.136 line:82%
Let's go. Faster. Put them
in the ambulance.

121
00:12:06.428 --> 00:12:07.928 line:82%

We're terrified, sir.

142
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.303 line:82%
Their leader, Abu Usman, was shot.

How many nurses are you?

148
00:13:27.178 --> 00:13:29.178 line:82%
25 Indian and 15 Pakistani.

149
00:13:29.437 --> 00:13:31.678 line:82%
So that's 25? Ok.

150
00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:33.636 line:82%
Keep your phone close.

151

After their offensive in Syria,
this is ISC's biggest push into Iraq.

156
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.886 line:82%
In the name of religion, they're turning
young men into deadly weapons.

157
00:13:54.178 --> 00:13:58.553 line:82%
You'll soon see a human bomb
in every bus, street and airliner.

158
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.595 line:82%
After Mosul, they've seized
the oil fields in Ikrit.

159
00:14:03.005 --> 00:14:06.511 line:82%
They're the richest terrorist
organisation in the world today...

160
00:14:06.697 --> 00:14:10.555 line:82%
...because they now control
70% of Iraq's oil fields.

161
00:14:12.136 --> 00:14:15.261 line:82%
Sorry to disturb, sir.
You should watch the news.

162
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.928 line:82%
"The horrendous act of terrorism
is nothing short of an act of war.

163
00:14:20.303 --> 00:14:23.136 line:82%
"We've spoken to our British,
German and French allies...

164
00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:26.470 line:82%
...to discuss targets and joint
controlled air strikes."

165
00:14:26.817 --> 00:14:28.428 line:82%
"This act shall not go..."

166
00:14:28.606 --> 00:14:31.470 line:82%
- This is not good news.
- What's happening, Shenoy?

167
00:14:31.729 --> 00:14:33.931 line:82%
The Americans won't take this
lying down.

168
00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:39.345 line:82%
They've been longing to start
air strikes on ISC targets in Iraq.

169
00:14:39.586 --> 00:14:42.261 line:82%
The UN has held them back.

170
00:14:42.595 --> 00:14:47.553 line:82%
James's execution has given them
a reason to turn Ikrit to dust.

171
00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.840 line:82%
- Meaning?
- The Americans...

172
00:14:50.052 --> 00:14:52.511 line:82%
...will strike the hospital where
our nurses are and where...

173
00:14:52.678 --> 00:14:53.817 line:82%
...and Abu Usman is.

174
00:14:54.136 --> 00:14:57.303 line:82%
The Americans will make any excuse.
They cannot be allowed to do this.

175
00:14:57.511 --> 00:14:59.178 line:82%
Stop them, Shenoy!

176
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.789 line:82%
CIA HEADQUARTERS.
LANGLEY, U.S.A.

177
00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:04.011 line:82%
Shenoy! Long time.

178
00:15:04.345 --> 00:15:08.303 line:82%
- When did we last meet?
- 1993. Just after the Gulf War.

179
00:15:09.511 --> 00:15:11.511 line:82%
I've a packed schedule.
Let's walk and talk.

180
00:15:11.803 --> 00:15:14.720 line:82%
- You know why I'm here?
- I know your nurses are there.

181
00:15:15.053 --> 00:15:16.845 line:82%
You can't bomb Ikrit.

182
00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:18.511 line:82%
Yes, we can.

183
00:15:18.886 --> 00:15:21.683 line:82%
You know this game.
You've been here long enough.

184
00:15:21.886 --> 00:15:23.761 line:82%
What would you do if the nurses
were American?

185
00:15:24.095 --> 00:15:26.845 line:82%
- We'd get them out.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

186
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:29.777 line:82%
For old time's sake, Adam.

187
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:31.886 line:82%
Give me some time.

188
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.470 line:82%
Please.

189
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:39.095 line:82%
Ok. Seven days.

190
00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:41.011 line:82%
Get your nurses out of there.

191
00:15:41.595 --> 00:15:43.451 line:82%
Eighth day we bomb Ikrit.

192
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.345 line:82%
- Seven days?
- Yes, sir.

193
00:15:47.678 --> 00:15:50.747 line:82%
That's not enough time to mount
a dangerous mission.

194
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:53.595 line:82%
You're right, sir. But we must.

195
00:15:54.595 --> 00:15:56.053 line:82%
Who will do it?

196
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.386 line:82%
Tiger.

197
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.053 line:82%
Is Tiger alive?

198
00:16:05.053 --> 00:16:07.970 line:82%
I was told that he died on a mission
in Cuba eight years ago.

199
00:16:08.345 --> 00:16:10.303 line:82%
That was for the files.

200
00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:11.886 line:82%
He's hiding somewhere.

201
00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:14.220 line:82%
We'll find him.

202
00:16:14.595 --> 00:16:16.386 line:82%
In so little time...

203
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.095 line:82%
...he's the only person who can
pull it off.

204
00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:22.345 line:82%
Shenoy, I'm seriously not interested.

205
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:25.417 line:82%
Just get our nurses out of there!

206
00:16:25.928 --> 00:16:29.287 line:82%
Karan, get on to all our agents.

207
00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:33.631 line:82%
I want Tiger in 24 hours.

208
00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:39.928 line:82%
Holidays over, Tiger.

209
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.553 line:82%
Let's get back to work.

210
00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.303 line:82%
SOMEWHERE IN THE AUSTRIAN ALPS,
INNSBRUCK, TYROL

211
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:28.636 line:82%
"Nature gave every animal an instinct
to hunt so that it can survive.

212
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.553 line:82%
"Human beings also hunted for years
to survive...

213
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.761 line:82%
Junior! You Brit boy!
Talking English again?

214
00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:37.345 line:82%
What did I tell you?

215
00:17:37.678 --> 00:17:40.553 line:82%
- Man is identified by his...
- ...mother tongue.

216
00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:42.136 line:82%
So what are you?

217
00:17:42.345 --> 00:17:45.803 line:82%
Indian on your side,
Pakistani on Ma's side.

218
00:17:46.136 --> 00:17:47.303 line:82%
Don't know about your Ma...

219
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.928 line:82%
...but when you're with me
you're fully Indian.

220
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.928 line:82%
- Where is he?
- In front of me.

221
00:18:04.386 --> 00:18:06.220 line:82%
- How far?
- 50 ft.

222
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.970 line:82%
Look straight in his eyes.
Don't break eye contact.

223
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.220 line:82%
He's coming closer.

224
00:18:17.803 --> 00:18:20.095 line:82%
I shouldn't have read that chapter
on hunting.

225
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.636 line:82%
Calm down, Junior.

226
00:18:22.095 --> 00:18:23.511 line:82%
I'm his prey today.

227
00:18:24.053 --> 00:18:25.428 line:82%
Everyone hunts.

228
00:18:27.303 --> 00:18:30.095 line:82%
But no one hunts like a tiger.

229
00:19:09.678 --> 00:19:12.678 line:82%
Before he comes round, let's split.

230
00:19:13.053 --> 00:19:13.803 line:82%
Wait, Junior.

231
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.511 line:82%
Wolves don't hunt alone.

232
00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:19.970 line:82%
Wolves hunt in a pack.
There are more coming.

233
00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:24.511 line:82%
Bummer!

234
00:19:25.136 --> 00:19:27.178 line:82%
- You taught you that?
- Ma says it.

235
00:19:27.928 --> 00:19:29.095 line:82%
Bummer!

236
00:19:29.636 --> 00:19:32.511 line:82%
- Now what?
- See our car down there?

237
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.303 line:82%
On my count of three...
fly to the truck and stay there.

238
00:19:39.886 --> 00:19:42.595 line:82%
One second! Are you going
to kill all those wolves?

239
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.970 line:82%
If I don't get your friends...

240
00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.636 line:82%
...you will end up...

241
00:19:50.803 --> 00:19:52.803 line:82%
...a kebab on their menu tonight.

242
00:19:53.053 --> 00:19:53.886 line:82%
Maybe.

243
00:19:54.095 --> 00:19:57.970 line:82%
If you save me, but do not kill
those wolves...

244
00:19:58.345 --> 00:20:00.678 line:82%
...then I'll believe you're
the real Tiger.

245
00:20:03.345 --> 00:20:04.053 line:82%
Deal?

246
00:20:12.136 --> 00:20:12.970 line:82%
Run!

247
00:21:00.095 --> 00:21:02.428 line:82%
Leave me alone! Go!

248
00:21:32.303 --> 00:21:33.095 line:82%
Get away!

249
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.095 line:82%
Go away!

250
00:22:19.178 --> 00:22:20.886 line:82%
Go away!

251
00:22:34.636 --> 00:22:35.511 line:82%
Dad!

252
00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:52.345 line:82%
Get into the truck! Hurry!

253
00:23:17.386 --> 00:23:18.595 line:82%
Stay still!

254
00:23:30.803 --> 00:23:31.678 line:82%
Junior.

255
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.178 line:82%
One.

256
00:23:38.428 --> 00:23:39.178 line:82%
Two...

257
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:50.845 line:82%
Yes!

258
00:24:08.136 --> 00:24:09.595 line:82%
Hi, Zophia. How are you?

259
00:24:09.845 --> 00:24:12.761 line:82%
- Fine. And you?
- I'm good.

260
00:24:13.345 --> 00:24:15.845 line:82%
Finally Arthur and I've booked
our tickets to India.

261
00:24:16.136 --> 00:24:17.970 line:82%
It's his 80th birthday next month.

262
00:24:18.428 --> 00:24:21.511 line:82%
He has dreamt of seeing
the Taj Mahal all his life.

263
00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:23.053 line:82%
The monument of love.

264
00:24:23.803 --> 00:24:24.720 line:82%
How sweet!

265
00:24:25.053 --> 00:24:27.970 line:82%
You think I should take some
vaccinations?

266
00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:31.970 line:82%
For yellow fever, malaria, dengue
and bird flu?

267
00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:34.928 line:82%
What other viruses are brewing there?

268
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.766 line:82%
- Police.
- Never heard of that virus.

269
00:24:38.941 --> 00:24:42.553 line:82%
Call the police. There's a group
of muggers. They have a gun.

270
00:24:43.095 --> 00:24:44.678 line:82%
The money. Hurry up!

271
00:24:45.011 --> 00:24:46.720 line:82%
Come on, gimme the money!

272
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:50.374 line:82%
Give me the money. Hurry up!

273
00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:52.085 line:82%
Or I'll shoot you.

274
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.406 line:82%
Come on.

275
00:25:14.386 --> 00:25:15.553 line:82%
Hurry up!

276
00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:50.220 line:82%
That's what we call
women's empowerment!

277
00:25:51.053 --> 00:25:54.178 line:82%
Zoya darling, please call the cops.

278
00:26:07.178 --> 00:26:10.928 line:82%
Forget that piece of junk. You'll
never find your Indian station.

279
00:26:14.261 --> 00:26:15.095 line:82%
Meaning?

280
00:26:18.178 --> 00:26:21.845 line:82%
There's only one meaning.
You're right and I'm wrong.

281
00:26:22.303 --> 00:26:24.803 line:82%
- Did I say that?
- That's what you meant.

282
00:26:25.095 --> 00:26:28.011 line:82%
I search for shalgum and tinde
all over Austria. Why?

283
00:26:28.261 --> 00:26:29.970 line:82%
Because he only eats
Indian food.

284
00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:32.428 line:82%
Can you remember when we
last ate out?

285
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.428 line:82%
You know what...

286
00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:39.261 line:82%
...you guys eat and leave the plates
on the table.

287
00:26:39.495 --> 00:26:41.636 line:82%
I'll scrub the dishes later.

288
00:26:46.845 --> 00:26:48.218 line:82%
Junior...

289
00:26:48.636 --> 00:26:50.761 line:82%
...your Ma is really mad at me.

290
00:26:55.053 --> 00:26:56.470 line:82%
Dad, let's take a walk.

291
00:26:56.678 --> 00:27:00.720 line:82%
If you loved her, would you forget
your 8th wedding anniversary?

292
00:27:04.678 --> 00:27:05.845 line:82%
Oh!

293
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.928 line:82%
That's why she's sulking.

294
00:27:10.928 --> 00:27:13.845 line:82%
- Now the drama will last for months.
- No.

295
00:27:14.553 --> 00:27:16.386 line:82%
- Here.
- What is it?

296
00:27:16.636 --> 00:27:18.595 line:82%
Tomorrow's programme.

297
00:27:18.928 --> 00:27:20.970 line:82%
I have done all the bookings.

298
00:27:21.261 --> 00:27:24.678 line:82%
Make sure you make her feel
special tomorrow.

299
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.220 line:82%
Your credit card.

300
00:27:27.553 --> 00:27:29.886 line:82%
I've used it six times yesterday.

301
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.842 line:82%
Please add some more credit!

302
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.220 line:82%
You son of a spy!

303
00:27:41.803 --> 00:27:44.011 line:82%
Sat Sri Akal. Namaskar. Adaab.

304
00:27:44.428 --> 00:27:47.345 line:82%
This is All India Radio, Amritsar.

305
00:27:47.886 --> 00:27:52.011 line:82%
We have a request from Shams Alam
from the other side of the border.

306
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.928 line:82%
His wife, Samia Zehra,
is angry with him.

307
00:27:57.135 --> 00:28:01.639 line:82%
A sweet present from us.

308
00:28:07.714 --> 00:28:11.678 line:82%
These unspun threads...

309
00:28:12.303 --> 00:28:15.595 line:82%
...that I have tied around you...

310
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:23.595 line:82%
...make our bond beyond separation.

311
00:28:25.947 --> 00:28:30.152 line:82%
Put aside your fleeting anger...

312
00:28:30.503 --> 00:28:34.131 line:82%
...sweet love, listen...

313
00:28:34.826 --> 00:28:37.428 line:82%
...to the conversations in my heart.

314
00:28:38.886 --> 00:28:41.720 line:82%
We sit side by side...

315
00:28:42.573 --> 00:28:46.001 line:82%
...looking at each other.

316
00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:48.845 line:82%
The conversations in my heart...

317
00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:53.595 line:82%
We'll sit side by side
as the days pass...

318
00:28:54.011 --> 00:28:57.444 line:82%
...and fulfill the truth of our love.

319
00:28:59.345 --> 00:29:03.574 line:82%
Must you torment me?

320
00:29:04.845 --> 00:29:09.040 line:82%
Why pretend you don't hear...

321
00:29:09.255 --> 00:29:12.553 line:82%
...the conversations in my heart?

322
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.343 line:82%
We sit side by side...

323
00:29:16.845 --> 00:29:20.303 line:82%
...looking at each other.

324
00:29:50.595 --> 00:29:55.053 line:82%
I'll hide you from the many.
Put you on a pedestal.

325
00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:57.217 line:82%
You are mine.

326
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:59.678 line:82%
Keep me close to you.

327
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:02.470 line:82%
There will never be any distance
between us.

328
00:30:03.386 --> 00:30:06.221 line:82%
Nothing will keep us apart.

329
00:30:08.928 --> 00:30:13.136 line:82%
I'll hide you from the many.
Put you on a pedestal.

330
00:30:13.434 --> 00:30:15.511 line:82%
You are mine.

331
00:30:16.011 --> 00:30:18.011 line:82%
Keep me close to you.

332
00:30:18.261 --> 00:30:20.720 line:82%
There will never be any distance
between us.

333
00:30:21.595 --> 00:30:25.880 line:82%
Nothing will keep us apart.

334
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:28.886 line:82%
I live this life for you.

335
00:30:35.451 --> 00:30:39.850 line:82%
You are my life.
I am yours.

336
00:30:40.886 --> 00:30:44.925 line:82%
Blow hot and cold but don't ignore...

337
00:30:45.186 --> 00:30:47.845 line:82%
...the conversations in my heart.

338
00:30:49.178 --> 00:30:52.373 line:82%
We sit side by side...

339
00:30:52.893 --> 00:30:56.242 line:82%
...looking at each other.

340
00:30:56.595 --> 00:30:58.680 line:82%
The conversations in my heart...

341
00:31:01.449 --> 00:31:05.347 line:82%
Those dark nights.

342
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:08.470 line:82%
My days are overcast.

343
00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:14.605 line:82%
My sweet beloved...

344
00:31:15.178 --> 00:31:17.595 line:82%
...hold me close.

345
00:31:19.699 --> 00:31:23.979 line:82%
The sky will pale without you.

346
00:31:24.414 --> 00:31:27.894 line:82%
My dreams will remain unfulfilled
without you.

347
00:31:28.634 --> 00:31:31.136 line:82%
The conversations in my heart...

348
00:31:32.595 --> 00:31:35.860 line:82%
We sit side by side...

349
00:31:36.321 --> 00:31:39.635 line:82%
...looking at each other.

350
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.448 line:82%
The conversations in my heart...

351
00:31:44.054 --> 00:31:47.178 line:82%
We'll sit side by side
as the days pass...

352
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.462 line:82%
...and fulfill the truth of our love.

353
00:31:53.136 --> 00:31:57.874 line:82%
I know why you secretly glance
at our names...

354
00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.585 line:82%
...written side by side.

355
00:32:02.885 --> 00:32:05.753 line:82%
The conversations in my heart.

356
00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:10.168 line:82%
We sit side by side...

357
00:32:10.579 --> 00:32:14.414 line:82%
...looking at each other.

358
00:32:28.178 --> 00:32:30.345 line:82%
Are you still up?

359
00:32:30.886 --> 00:32:33.178 line:82%
Dad, you have some friends over.

360
00:32:43.595 --> 00:32:44.981 line:82%
Shenoy sir!

361
00:32:46.272 --> 00:32:48.386 line:82%
Junior! Off to bed.

362
00:32:54.011 --> 00:32:56.630 line:82%
Tiger.

363
00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.761 line:82%
So many tubes? You ok?

364
00:33:01.428 --> 00:33:02.720 line:82%
What to do?

365
00:33:03.095 --> 00:33:06.386 line:82%
Since you left,
I have lost my breath.

366
00:33:09.532 --> 00:33:13.399 line:82%
- My colleague, Karan.
- I know.

367
00:33:16.903 --> 00:33:17.803 line:82%
Zoya.

368
00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:19.345 line:82%
I know.

369
00:33:21.345 --> 00:33:22.220 line:82%
Shall we eat?

370
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:26.220 line:82%
If we're eating black lentils made
by your hands, then we'll eat.

371
00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:34.595 line:82%
Perfect!

372
00:33:35.303 --> 00:33:37.845 line:82%
The same taste. Nothing has changed.

373
00:33:38.303 --> 00:33:43.136 line:82%
He doesn't slice a tomato for me,
and he makes lentils for you.

374
00:33:43.678 --> 00:33:44.682 line:82%
I'm impressed.

375
00:33:44.928 --> 00:33:48.105 line:82%
We go back a long way. You won't
understand.

376
00:33:48.356 --> 00:33:49.720 line:82%
I do, sir.

377
00:33:50.678 --> 00:33:54.595 line:82%
If you've come all this way
looking for your best agent...

378
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.838 line:82%
...you won't be talking in front of me.

379
00:33:59.136 --> 00:34:02.220 line:82%
I'll take your leave.
Call if you need anything.

380
00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:03.845 line:82%
Thank you.

381
00:34:04.136 --> 00:34:07.303 line:82%
You've been hiding for years.

382
00:34:08.636 --> 00:34:10.386 line:82%
But we found you in 24 hours.

383
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:13.803 line:82%
Some rice?

384
00:34:17.903 --> 00:34:23.396 line:82%
For years I've sent you a coded
message: "Saare jahaan se achha."

385
00:34:24.011 --> 00:34:29.178 line:82%
I sent it to you from countries where
the Indian population was small.

386
00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:34.761 line:82%
The IP address always indicates
my exact location.

387
00:34:35.221 --> 00:34:39.678 line:82%
It means that you didn't need
to look for me.

388
00:34:40.095 --> 00:34:43.928 line:82%
I've always let you know
my whereabouts.

389
00:34:45.386 --> 00:34:47.420 line:82%
The lentils are delicious.

390
00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:50.803 line:82%
RAW forgot me.

391
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:54.603 line:82%
I didn't forget RAW.

392
00:34:59.595 --> 00:35:01.261 line:82%
Absolutely unreal.

393
00:35:02.261 --> 00:35:05.011 line:82%
Sir, he has a full-blown RAW
operation room here.

394
00:35:05.678 --> 00:35:07.553 line:82%
He's hacked all our servers.

395
00:35:07.824 --> 00:35:10.678 line:82%
Tiger, the reason we're here...

396
00:35:10.845 --> 00:35:14.845 line:82%
...25 Indian nurses are being held
hostage in an Iraqi hospital.

397
00:35:15.886 --> 00:35:18.178 line:82%
The CIA has given you a week.

398
00:35:18.511 --> 00:35:21.761 line:82%
After that, air strikes and game over.

399
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.220 line:82%
I've done the groundwork.

400
00:35:26.886 --> 00:35:30.553 line:82%
These are the best guys
you could ever find...

401
00:35:31.303 --> 00:35:33.303 line:82%
...to accomplish your mission.

402
00:35:33.761 --> 00:35:35.845 line:82%
Pack your bags, Tiger.

403
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.511 line:82%
There's no time.

404
00:35:39.886 --> 00:35:42.178 line:82%
No, sir. I'm sorry.

405
00:35:43.136 --> 00:35:47.720 line:82%
The Tiger you came looking for,
that Tiger has changed.

406
00:35:49.386 --> 00:35:50.511 line:82%
The reason...

407
00:35:51.428 --> 00:35:55.044 line:82%
...I left RAW was... Zoya.

408
00:35:56.136 --> 00:35:58.385 line:82%
Now I have another reason.

409
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.720 line:82%
Junior.

410
00:36:01.428 --> 00:36:03.720 line:82%
He's my life, my world...

411
00:36:04.636 --> 00:36:05.886 line:82%
...and my weakness.

412
00:36:06.321 --> 00:36:09.011 line:82%
Sir, we need you on this mission.

413
00:36:09.553 --> 00:36:11.178 line:82%
We're wasting precious time.

414
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:15.053 line:82%
Now we know where you live,
and who your family is.

415
00:36:15.345 --> 00:36:18.470 line:82%
Karan, the tiger is sleeping.

416
00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:24.095 line:82%
Don't pull its tail.
It'll devour you.

417
00:36:27.731 --> 00:36:30.720 line:82%
India's honour is at stake.

418
00:36:33.845 --> 00:36:36.511 line:82%
Well, you know better.

419
00:36:44.803 --> 00:36:46.261 line:82%
"Bhagat Singh shouts...

420
00:36:46.886 --> 00:36:52.176 line:82%
"Long live the revolution!"

421
00:37:02.067 --> 00:37:03.882 line:82%
THE HERO WITHIN

422
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:11.370 line:82%
What is it, Tiger?

423
00:37:17.553 --> 00:37:18.886 line:82%
Nothing really.

424
00:37:19.761 --> 00:37:23.095 line:82%
Everyone believes you love me
more than anything in the world.

425
00:37:24.761 --> 00:37:27.928 line:82%
But I know that you love
your country even more.

426
00:37:30.095 --> 00:37:32.136 line:82%
And that's the thing I respect
about you the most.

427
00:37:36.845 --> 00:37:40.090 line:82%
You're the world's biggest hero
for him.

428
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:46.595 line:82%
How will he feel if he knew that his
parents were two agents on the run...

429
00:37:47.345 --> 00:37:51.915 line:82%
...who have put duty behind them,
and live a life of leisure now.

430
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.053 line:82%
In your place, I'd go and rescue
those nurses.

431
00:38:00.595 --> 00:38:01.913 line:82%
And yes...

432
00:38:03.636 --> 00:38:05.273 line:82%
...always remember.

433
00:38:07.136 --> 00:38:09.720 line:82%
Junior and I are not your weakness.

434
00:38:11.095 --> 00:38:12.178 line:82%
We're your strength.

435
00:38:18.011 --> 00:38:23.625 line:82%
5 DAYS TO AIRSTRIKE. SOMEWHERE
IN THE LIWA DESERT - ABU DHABI

436
00:39:03.095 --> 00:39:04.261 line:82%
Hello, sir.

437
00:39:05.803 --> 00:39:07.261 line:82%
Some money, sir.

438
00:39:07.636 --> 00:39:11.303 line:82%
The team will meet you at the
Turkey-Iraq border.

439
00:39:11.678 --> 00:39:13.011 line:82%
I'll send you their details.

440
00:39:13.327 --> 00:39:16.070 line:82%
This is my mission. And my team.

441
00:39:16.635 --> 00:39:19.261 line:82%
- Sir, you're taking over.
- You want to?

442
00:39:19.428 --> 00:39:20.470 line:82%
No, sir.

443
00:39:20.678 --> 00:39:24.136 line:82%
- Time is short.
- So don't waste it.

444
00:39:25.595 --> 00:39:26.678 line:82%
This is my team.

445
00:39:27.428 --> 00:39:30.095 line:82%
Azaan Akbar, the Indian army's
best sniper.

446
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.300 line:82%
If he wasn't busy in covert
operations...

447
00:39:33.553 --> 00:39:36.028 line:82%
...he'd be winning gold medals
for India.

448
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.363 line:82%
Namit Khanna, bombs and
explosives expert.

449
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.301 line:82%
He's diffused 4 bombs in 3 minutes.

450
00:39:54.477 --> 00:39:56.213 line:82%
Saved many lives in the Kashmir
valley.

451
00:40:01.128 --> 00:40:03.440 line:82%
Rakesh Sharma, a senior citizen.

452
00:40:05.511 --> 00:40:11.818 line:82%
A bit frail but has a technical brain
that can outsmart NASA's best.

453
00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:24.053 line:82%
Long live Lord Hanuman!

454
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:28.178 line:82%
Wow, sir. You've done your homework.

455
00:40:28.407 --> 00:40:30.845 line:82%
Mother made sure I did.

456
00:40:31.886 --> 00:40:34.303 line:82%
Sir, will they get here in time?

457
00:40:38.178 --> 00:40:40.511 line:82%
Namit, Azaan.

458
00:40:42.553 --> 00:40:43.761 line:82%
Rakeshji!

459
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:46.053 line:82%
Very nice. Super.

460
00:40:47.053 --> 00:40:47.803 line:82%
Welcome!

461
00:40:48.636 --> 00:40:49.220 line:82%
Yes, Karan?

462
00:40:49.428 --> 00:40:50.966 line:82%
Tiger is insisting on his team.

463
00:40:51.176 --> 00:40:52.720 line:82%
He says it's his mission.

464
00:40:52.886 --> 00:40:54.095 line:82%
I expected this.

465
00:40:54.386 --> 00:40:56.303 line:82%
We won't have any control.

466
00:40:56.595 --> 00:40:58.470 line:82%
We have no choice.

467
00:40:58.886 --> 00:41:01.803 line:82%
There's something worth
remembering...

468
00:41:02.136 --> 00:41:02.845 line:82%
Sir?

469
00:41:03.178 --> 00:41:07.172 line:82%
He has lived with Zoya, a Pakistani
agent, for 8 years.

470
00:41:10.761 --> 00:41:14.345 line:82%
- Make sure she did not turn him.
- Absolutely, sir.

471
00:41:18.345 --> 00:41:22.888 line:82%
Make your way to Al-Nusra on the
Iraq-Turkey border.

472
00:41:23.073 --> 00:41:24.285 line:82%
AL-NUSRA
IRAQ-TURKEY BORDER

473
00:41:25.636 --> 00:41:31.136 line:82%
All illegal human traffic into Iraq
passes through there.

474
00:41:33.803 --> 00:41:34.553 line:82%
That's where...

475
00:41:34.845 --> 00:41:37.953 line:82%
...ISC loads?up their tankers
with oil...

476
00:41:38.261 --> 00:41:41.970 line:82%
...and dispatches them to Mosul
and Ikrit oil refineries.

477
00:41:43.345 --> 00:41:48.720 line:82%
Our man Zulfikar has worked for
RAW for 8 years. He'll meet you there.

478
00:41:49.053 --> 00:41:53.720 line:82%
Zulfikar will hide you in an oil
tanker and smuggle you into Iraq.

479
00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:12.886 line:82%
The convoy usually has 8 trucks.

480
00:42:13.886 --> 00:42:17.928 line:82%
Zulfikar will fill water instead
of oil into one of the trucks.

481
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.803 line:82%
He'll pour oil over the water
to camouflage it.

482
00:42:29.095 --> 00:42:36.111 line:82%
Ikrit is 3 hours from the border.
You'll soon be journeying into Iraq.

483
00:42:50.327 --> 00:42:51.508 line:82%
IRAQ BORDER 10KM

484
00:42:52.678 --> 00:42:55.261 line:82%
Everyone, out!

485
00:42:56.303 --> 00:42:59.845 line:82%
Nothing moves without ISC's
permission.

486
00:43:00.386 --> 00:43:02.970 line:82%
The tankers are often checked
at the border.

487
00:43:35.386 --> 00:43:36.511 line:82%
Long live Lord Hanuman!

488
00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:38.803 line:82%
The plan, sir?

489
00:43:39.345 --> 00:43:41.178 line:82%
We can't walk into the hospital...

490
00:43:42.212 --> 00:43:45.761 line:82%
...so we'll pass off as illegal
oil refinery workers.

491
00:43:46.178 --> 00:43:48.678 line:82%
There, Namit will set off
a controlled blast.

492
00:43:48.928 --> 00:43:50.928 line:82%
They'll think it's an accident.

493
00:43:51.303 --> 00:43:54.053 line:82%
We'll act as if we've suffered burns
in the blast.

494
00:43:54.454 --> 00:43:56.636 line:82%
The ISC will have no choice.

495
00:43:56.928 --> 00:44:01.011 line:82%
They'll have to send the injured
workers to the Ikrit hospital.

496
00:44:01.502 --> 00:44:03.386 line:82%
Once we're in the hospital...

497
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.178 line:82%
...we'll have two days to get
the nurses out.

498
00:44:09.803 --> 00:44:12.011 line:82%
And send Abu Usman...

499
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:17.178 line:82%
You make it sound so easy,
if your plan is that easy...

500
00:44:17.485 --> 00:44:21.303 line:82%
...I'll go straight on a pilgrimage
to Amarnath.

501
00:44:21.579 --> 00:44:25.845 line:82%
If it works or not, you're headed
on a pilgrimage anyway.

502
00:44:26.136 --> 00:44:27.886 line:82%
Pawan's number.

503
00:44:28.345 --> 00:44:29.720 line:82%
The RAW agent there.

504
00:44:30.345 --> 00:44:32.886 line:82%
He'll get you whatever you need.

505
00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.253 line:82%
You'll need to tell him the
recognition code.

506
00:44:36.554 --> 00:44:39.345 line:82%
"Tu tu tu tutu tara."

507
00:44:40.137 --> 00:44:43.303 line:82%
The answer to the code is:
"Our friend is here."

508
00:44:43.845 --> 00:44:45.261 line:82%
Is RAW into comedy these days?

509
00:44:45.636 --> 00:44:48.011 line:82%
Not my idea, sir. It came
from the bosses.

510
00:44:48.678 --> 00:44:49.845 line:82%
Coming to the point.

511
00:44:50.395 --> 00:44:51.970 line:82%
If you're lucky...

512
00:44:52.303 --> 00:44:56.386 line:82%
...and manage to get into this
heavily-guarded oil refinery...

513
00:44:57.011 --> 00:44:58.511 line:82%
...then the mission starts.

514
00:44:58.845 --> 00:44:59.803 line:82%
And yours ends.

515
00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:04.970 line:82%
Tell Mr Shenoy, "Tu tu tu tutu tara."

516
00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:09.386 line:82%
"Tiger is back on the prowl again!"

517
00:45:10.928 --> 00:45:15.511 line:82%
AL FARIDOON OIL REFINERY,
IKRIT

518
00:45:38.928 --> 00:45:40.761 line:82%
Stay in line!

519
00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:50.678 line:82%
Amir Baghdawi is coming.

520
00:46:03.011 --> 00:46:05.247 line:82%
This is Amir al-Baghdawi.

521
00:46:05.595 --> 00:46:07.928 line:82%
ISC's number 2.

522
00:46:08.386 --> 00:46:11.973 line:82%
The oil fields and refineries are
under his control.

523
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.303 line:82%
After Abu Usman, he's the second
in command.

524
00:46:23.678 --> 00:46:26.803 line:82%
He's the ISC oil deal-maker.

525
00:46:27.386 --> 00:46:29.967 line:82%
Watch out for another man.

526
00:46:30.538 --> 00:46:34.970 line:82%
They call him "Thu'ban"
in Arabic. Means "snake."

527
00:46:35.261 --> 00:46:38.970 line:82%
Pasha Baghdawi! My Amir.

528
00:46:39.343 --> 00:46:41.511 line:82%
One meeting.

529
00:46:42.446 --> 00:46:45.199 line:82%
- One meeting.
- Back! Or I'll shoot you.

530
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.011 line:82%
I give you. This is Indian.
Hollywood.

531
00:46:48.447 --> 00:46:49.970 line:82%
One meeting.

532
00:46:50.303 --> 00:46:51.970 line:82%
- Go back!
- Why?

533
00:46:52.215 --> 00:46:54.470 line:82%
I give everything. You show gun.

534
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.095 line:82%
Back! What did I say.

535
00:46:56.428 --> 00:46:58.328 line:82%
Ok!

536
00:46:59.428 --> 00:47:00.886 line:82%
Just you wait, sonny.

537
00:47:01.178 --> 00:47:05.761 line:82%
If I don't hang you out to dry,
my name isn't Thu'ban.

538
00:47:06.136 --> 00:47:07.886 line:82%
His real name is Firdaus.

539
00:47:08.178 --> 00:47:11.095 line:82%
He's an Indian but has lived
in Iraq for 25 years.

540
00:47:12.303 --> 00:47:16.511 line:82%
From the era of Saddam and America
to ISC, he has contacts everywhere.

541
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:21.386 line:82%
He supplies the oil refineries with
illegal labour.

542
00:47:22.178 --> 00:47:25.470 line:82%
He'd sell his parents for money.

543
00:47:26.095 --> 00:47:28.470 line:82%
He has only one purpose now...

544
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.178 line:82%
...to get close to Amir al-Baghdawi.

545
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:36.470 line:82%
- Where from?
- Bangladesh.

546
00:47:37.636 --> 00:47:39.928 line:82%
Work hard or I'll break your legs.

547
00:47:40.261 --> 00:47:44.136 line:82%
If I see you nodding off at work,
I'll sting you in the neck.

548
00:47:44.678 --> 00:47:45.720 line:82%
Go!

549
00:47:46.428 --> 00:47:47.470 line:82%
And listen...

550
00:47:48.303 --> 00:47:50.178 line:82%
...fill out the paperwork correctly.

551
00:47:50.636 --> 00:47:53.636 line:82%
They drop dead and get us into trouble.

552
00:47:54.553 --> 00:47:55.845 line:82%
From India?

553
00:47:57.845 --> 00:48:01.970 line:82%
Are you a newly wed?
So, take off that veil!

554
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.970 line:82%
Now I can see the bride!

555
00:48:08.136 --> 00:48:09.761 line:82%
- A labourer?
- No.

556
00:48:10.178 --> 00:48:11.678 line:82%
Junior engineer.

557
00:48:12.386 --> 00:48:14.303 line:82%
I have an ITI diploma.

558
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:19.220 line:82%
They are the labourers.

559
00:48:19.678 --> 00:48:23.595 line:82%
You're no engineer.
And they're no labourers.

560
00:48:24.053 --> 00:48:25.011 line:82%
Remember...

561
00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.011 line:82%
...I'll be watching you.

562
00:48:27.636 --> 00:48:32.303 line:82%
If you make any trouble, no one
will ever find your dead bodies.

563
00:48:33.595 --> 00:48:34.428 line:82%
Get going!

564
00:48:38.053 --> 00:48:41.428 line:82%
WORKERS' BARRACK, IKRIT

565
00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:45.220 line:82%
You're in room 69.

566
00:48:45.595 --> 00:48:48.303 line:82%
Don't be late for work or the boss
will blow a fuse.

567
00:48:53.636 --> 00:48:55.636 line:82%
My childhood dreams are coming true
in old age.

568
00:48:55.915 --> 00:48:57.845 line:82%
Ah! Sleeping on a bunk bed!

569
00:48:58.345 --> 00:49:01.886 line:82%
Namit, I'm putting my bag up here.

570
00:49:03.178 --> 00:49:04.928 line:82%
I want the upper bed.

571
00:49:05.345 --> 00:49:06.595 line:82%
Let the bag be.

572
00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:10.886 line:82%
What's the big deal about your bag?
Is the Quran in it?

573
00:49:17.979 --> 00:49:20.595 line:82%
What difference does it make
what I have in it?

574
00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.845 line:82%
It stays on the upper bunk.

575
00:49:26.553 --> 00:49:28.595 line:82%
Ok. Leave your bag there.

576
00:49:29.136 --> 00:49:31.470 line:82%
- Thank you.
- Tell me what's in the bag.

577
00:49:31.845 --> 00:49:33.345 line:82%
- I won't.
- Open it!

578
00:49:33.511 --> 00:49:34.636 line:82%
- No.
- Open it!

579
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:35.803 line:82%
Azaan...

580
00:49:45.209 --> 00:49:46.178 line:82%
Here, sir.

581
00:49:50.636 --> 00:49:52.886 line:82%
Fold it properly. Put it away.

582
00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:58.428 line:82%
Why not write "Indian army sniper"
on your forehead instead?

583
00:49:58.761 --> 00:49:59.970 line:82%
"Here to rescue the nurses."

584
00:50:00.345 --> 00:50:03.428 line:82%
The ISC guys fly their flag
everywhere...

585
00:50:03.928 --> 00:50:06.220 line:82%
...when we're done,
I'll fly our flag.

586
00:50:06.761 --> 00:50:12.053 line:82%
So the scum realize that Indians
are no less brave.

587
00:50:12.553 --> 00:50:13.345 line:82%
That's it, sir.

588
00:50:24.803 --> 00:50:25.970 line:82%
Your bag.

589
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.595 line:82%
- Thank you, Namit.
- Ok now?

590
00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:31.220 line:82%
Bravo!

591
00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:33.386 line:82%
But Azaan...

592
00:50:34.845 --> 00:50:38.553 line:82%
Being passionate is one thing,
expressing it is another.

593
00:50:40.928 --> 00:50:42.595 line:82%
We're RAW agents.

594
00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:59.761 line:82%
How many more days I have
to stay here?

595
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:03.220 line:82%
I think you'll recover in about
4 to 5 days.

596
00:51:03.845 --> 00:51:05.095 line:82%
Why did you save my life?

597
00:51:05.303 --> 00:51:06.553 line:82%
It's my duty.

598
00:51:07.178 --> 00:51:11.428 line:82%
My duty doesn't differentiate
between people or what they do.

599
00:51:11.803 --> 00:51:16.011 line:82%
No one has come to rescue us.
Trust me. We'll all be killed.

600
00:51:16.303 --> 00:51:19.428 line:82%
Sana, I've spoken to the Ambassador.
He'll talk to ISC.

601
00:51:19.636 --> 00:51:21.011 line:82%
And they'll listen?

602
00:51:22.011 --> 00:51:24.261 line:82%
They're crazy. Crazy.

603
00:51:25.095 --> 00:51:26.261 line:82%
Are you an Indian?

604
00:51:29.845 --> 00:51:31.303 line:82%
Your Hindi is good.

605
00:51:31.928 --> 00:51:34.428 line:82%
My father was the Syrian ambassador
in Delhi.

606
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:37.511 line:82%
I was 8 when we moved there.

607
00:51:38.871 --> 00:51:40.428 line:82%
Chanakyapuri.

608
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:43.386 line:82%
I went to school for 8 years there.

609
00:51:44.386 --> 00:51:47.011 line:82%
Hindustani is a beautiful language.

610
00:51:48.011 --> 00:51:50.136 line:82%
When I was studying in Oxford...

611
00:51:50.553 --> 00:51:53.178 line:82%
...the subject of my thesis were
the poets Ghalib and Iqbal.

612
00:51:53.511 --> 00:51:54.720 line:82%
Amazing!

613
00:51:55.553 --> 00:51:59.261 line:82%
How could anyone wield a gun having
studied these great poets?

614
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:03.553 line:82%
I'm going. I can't take it.

615
00:52:03.761 --> 00:52:06.053 line:82%
You crazy? If they catch you,
they'll kill you.

616
00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:08.261 line:82%
They'll kill us anyway.

617
00:52:09.803 --> 00:52:10.511 line:82%
Sana...

618
00:52:10.928 --> 00:52:13.636 line:82%
If one of us escapes,
we can get help.

619
00:52:15.136 --> 00:52:17.318 line:82%
- Let me go.
- Sana!

620
00:52:17.845 --> 00:52:21.553 line:82%
I was a professor...at a New York
languages school.

621
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.595 line:82%
I was teaching the world poetry.

622
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:30.136 line:82%
After 9/11, they arrested me at a
train station without any evidence.

623
00:52:30.636 --> 00:52:32.511 line:82%
Only because of my name.

624
00:52:50.095 --> 00:52:51.636 line:82%
Get down! Move.

625
00:52:55.886 --> 00:52:57.803 line:82%
Hurry! Keep your head down.

626
00:53:12.136 --> 00:53:13.595 line:82%
Three years...

627
00:53:14.636 --> 00:53:17.136 line:82%
I was imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay
for three years.

628
00:53:17.553 --> 00:53:20.553 line:82%
I was left naked. They tied a dog
collar around my neck.

629
00:53:21.053 --> 00:53:23.428 line:82%
The American soldiers used
to urinate on us.

630
00:53:35.886 --> 00:53:39.761 line:82%
A man does not die when
he stops breathing...

631
00:53:40.618 --> 00:53:45.345 line:82%
...a man dies when his dignity
is snatched away from him.

632
00:53:49.761 --> 00:53:54.053 line:82%
Now every person that you see here
no longer fears death.

633
00:54:06.678 --> 00:54:07.595 line:82%
Sana!

634
00:54:07.928 --> 00:54:09.678 line:82%
Get back inside!
Or I'll shoot everyone.

635
00:54:17.011 --> 00:54:18.178 line:82%
Allah!

636
00:54:20.095 --> 00:54:21.191 line:82%
A nurse tried to escape.

637
00:54:22.095 --> 00:54:24.176 line:82%
Shoot her!

638
00:54:24.845 --> 00:54:26.136 line:82%
It's ok.

639
00:54:26.714 --> 00:54:30.469 line:82%
Please don't do this.
They're nurses.

640
00:54:30.699 --> 00:54:33.720 line:82%
- Don't panic!
- Don't do this, please.

641
00:54:34.386 --> 00:54:37.261 line:82%
This is going to make you
a much stronger person.

642
00:55:00.178 --> 00:55:01.053 line:82%
Salaam Aleikum.

643
00:55:08.136 --> 00:55:09.011 line:82%
Sir.

644
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.636 line:82%
- I need a month's leave, sir.
- Why?

645
00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:13.761 line:82%
I must go to India.
My wife's pregnant.

646
00:55:15.601 --> 00:55:17.970 line:82%
You're here, and your wife
is pregnant?

647
00:55:18.261 --> 00:55:20.761 line:82%
Didn't that happen last year too?
God be praised!

648
00:55:20.986 --> 00:55:25.803 line:82%
Strong Wi-Fi! It does the business
from this far? Get lost!

649
00:55:31.002 --> 00:55:33.220 line:82%
Wait! Pass me the binoculars.

650
00:55:33.544 --> 00:55:36.803 line:82%
Rakeshji, the control room is yours.

651
00:55:37.303 --> 00:55:41.845 line:82%
Azaan, keep a watch from
a safe place.

652
00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:51.886 line:82%
Namit, your job is the most important
of all.

653
00:55:52.352 --> 00:55:54.678 line:82%
The oil refinery.

654
00:55:54.921 --> 00:55:59.178 line:82%
Make sure your bomb doesn't wipe us
all out.

655
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:04.095 line:82%
I have a wife, and Junior is
very young.

656
00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:05.428 line:82%
Go easy.

657
00:56:07.928 --> 00:56:11.053 line:82%
This damn guy is plotting something.

658
00:56:27.707 --> 00:56:28.803 line:82%
Hello.

659
00:56:29.095 --> 00:56:31.178 line:82%

661
00:56:37.011 --> 00:56:38.178 line:82%
"Our friend is here."

662
00:56:41.031 --> 00:56:43.886 line:82%
Once is ok. You kidding me?

663
00:56:44.878 --> 00:56:46.886 line:82%
- So you're here?
- Arrived yesterday.

664
00:56:47.412 --> 00:56:50.011 line:82%
I have some Indian friends
who want to eat Indian food.

665
00:56:50.385 --> 00:56:51.928 line:82%
What do you want?

666
00:56:52.205 --> 00:56:55.053 line:82%
Half a kilo of Kashmiri chillies...

667
00:56:55.371 --> 00:56:57.970 line:82%
...and some vegetables.

668
00:56:58.404 --> 00:57:02.095 line:82%
Half a kilo of Kashmiri chillies?
Want everyone to get the runs?

669
00:57:02.772 --> 00:57:06.261 line:82%
We're Indians. We love masala.

670
00:57:06.757 --> 00:57:08.470 line:82%
Need anything else?

671
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:13.511 line:82%
The floor plan of the place
where the Indians are held.

672
00:57:14.053 --> 00:57:17.303 line:82%
How many guard them?

673
00:57:17.595 --> 00:57:19.053 line:82%
Slow down!

674
00:57:19.513 --> 00:57:21.678 line:82%
I need more than a day.

675
00:57:23.293 --> 00:57:24.553 line:82%

Number's changed.

679
00:57:44.303 --> 00:57:46.886 line:82%
Sonny, you're sharp.

680
00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:52.053 line:82%
Don't forget, I won't let you do what
you came here to do.

681
00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:00.345 line:82%
Gary! My friend.

682
00:58:00.707 --> 00:58:04.636 line:82%

Mr. Sam Jacobs.

686
00:58:20.803 --> 00:58:23.845 line:82%
Is America planning another
air strike?

687
00:58:26.928 --> 00:58:28.678 line:82%
Why don't you people understand...

688
00:58:28.928 --> 00:58:31.720 line:82%
- ...that God is with us?
- Stop using His name!

689
00:58:32.845 --> 00:58:34.053 line:82%
God is for peace.

690
00:58:34.337 --> 00:58:36.595 line:82%
You think we don't know
what's your plan?

691
00:58:37.345 --> 00:58:38.386 line:82%
Hassan...

692
00:58:40.758 --> 00:58:43.636 line:82%
Your friend, James Forward,
left this for us.

693
00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:49.178 line:82%
He's 13.

694
00:58:49.678 --> 00:58:52.428 line:82%
His whole family died in a drone
strike in Syria.

695
00:58:52.711 --> 00:58:55.345 line:82%
Including his four year-old sister.

696
00:58:57.095 --> 00:59:01.053 line:82%
My father used to say:
"Small coffins are the heaviest."

697
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:04.387 line:82%
For God's sake. Please don't do this.

698
00:59:05.699 --> 00:59:07.411 line:82%
Please don't do this.

699
00:59:20.893 --> 00:59:21.845 line:82%
Hakim...

700
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.345 line:82%

711
01:01:09.971 --> 01:01:11.513 line:82%
Me? Avinash.

01:01:12.346 --> 01:01:13.971 line:82%
Avinash Rathod.

713
01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:16.638 line:82%
My son, Junior...

714
01:01:18.055 --> 01:01:19.055 line:82%
...your age.

715
01:01:19.596 --> 01:01:22.513 line:82%
Nice face. Beautiful eyes.

716
01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:32.471 line:82%
What's going on?

717
01:01:35.263 --> 01:01:37.930 line:82%
- What's the protest?
- He's an Iraqi...

718
01:01:38.888 --> 01:01:40.763 line:82%
...is protesting against ISC.

719
01:01:41.055 --> 01:01:47.180 line:82%
This is the Iraqi army's last hold on
the city. The ISC want to take over.

720
01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:51.138 line:82%
You need this to make a bomb.

721
01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:55.846 line:82%
There are 25 men guarding
the hospital and Abu Usman.

722
01:02:03.138 --> 01:02:04.638 line:82%
I need the hospital floor plan.

723
01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:06.971 line:82%
That'll take more time.

724
01:02:07.555 --> 01:02:10.805 line:82%
It's in the City Council building
under ISC control.

725
01:02:15.138 --> 01:02:17.055 line:82%
Freedom!

726
01:02:57.971 --> 01:02:58.763 line:82%
Bummer.

727
01:03:01.846 --> 01:03:04.596 line:82%
ISC is not Islam.

728
01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.055 line:82%
Someone has taken Hassan.

729
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:13.221 line:82%
Go away!

730
01:03:17.138 --> 01:03:18.013 line:82%
Let go!

731
01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:28.846 line:82%
Bomb. Go!

732
01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:30.555 line:82%
Don't be scared.

733
01:03:31.763 --> 01:03:32.763 line:82%
Don't be scared.

734
01:03:38.763 --> 01:03:41.186 line:82%
Tiger! What are you doing?

735
01:03:42.763 --> 01:03:43.680 line:82%
Bummer!

736
01:03:43.888 --> 01:03:46.346 line:82%
- He's an ISC human bomb.
- I know.

737
01:03:46.638 --> 01:03:48.263 line:82%
This isn't our job.

738
01:03:48.555 --> 01:03:50.024 line:82%
Sure, it is.

739
01:03:50.248 --> 01:03:51.971 line:82%
Tiger! You'll get us all killed.

740
01:03:54.055 --> 01:03:58.596 line:82%
- This innocent boy is my son's age.
- A timer! 45 seconds to go.

741
01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.680 line:82%
Tiger, they're here. No time left.

742
01:04:05.888 --> 01:04:07.346 line:82%
We're right on time.

743
01:04:07.596 --> 01:04:11.015 line:82%
You clear the square. I'll clear them
off this planet.

744
01:04:14.471 --> 01:04:17.055 line:82%
ISC is here! Clear the square.

745
01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:19.805 line:82%
Clear the square!

746
01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:28.180 line:82%
I've found Hassan.

747
01:05:05.346 --> 01:05:07.525 line:82%
- Take care of the kid.
- Let's go.

748
01:06:40.305 --> 01:06:41.305 line:82%
Take a right!

749
01:06:46.096 --> 01:06:47.138 line:82%
Stop!

750
01:07:10.263 --> 01:07:11.555 line:82%
Take a left up ahead.

751
01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.596 line:82%
Damn!

752
01:09:00.513 --> 01:09:02.096 line:82%
Take the kid to the Indian Embassy.

753
01:10:04.263 --> 01:10:06.346 line:82%
No one move!

754
01:10:08.711 --> 01:10:10.878 line:82%
Give me the kid!

755
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.221 line:82%
Or I shoot.

756
01:10:32.971 --> 01:10:36.305 line:82%
- How come you're here?
- I'll tell you. Who's the kid?

757
01:10:37.013 --> 01:10:38.138 line:82%
I'll tell you.

758
01:10:39.305 --> 01:10:40.471 line:82%
Hassan, down!

759
01:11:20.471 --> 01:11:26.379 line:82%
Surround them. Hurry!
Get them out of the car.

760
01:11:57.930 --> 01:11:58.638 line:82%
Now!

761
01:12:44.432 --> 01:12:45.763 line:82%
They're my guys.

762
01:12:46.013 --> 01:12:47.346 line:82%
Meaning?

763
01:12:47.971 --> 01:12:48.930 line:82%
What the...

764
01:12:50.763 --> 01:12:51.430 line:82%
...hell!

765
01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:56.263 line:82%
You and RAW only heard
about the Indian nurses...

766
01:12:57.471 --> 01:12:59.763 line:82%
...but there are 15 Pakistani
nurses too.

767
01:13:07.138 --> 01:13:08.888 line:82%
That's why you came?

768
01:13:09.388 --> 01:13:11.555 line:82%
Must I let those nurses die?

769
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.721 line:82%
I convinced you to help.
And I mustn't?

770
01:13:15.555 --> 01:13:19.430 line:82%
15 minutes ago they shot our agent,
Pawan.

771
01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.596 line:82%
This young Hassan had a bomb...

772
01:13:23.055 --> 01:13:25.263 line:82%
...tied to him. They'd have
blown him up.

773
01:13:25.805 --> 01:13:29.263 line:82%
132 children were killed by terrorists
in Pakistan.

774
01:13:30.013 --> 01:13:32.202 line:82%
Were the kids to blame?

775
01:13:33.346 --> 01:13:38.263 line:82%
Because of a few troublemakers, my
country is misunderstood by the world.

776
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.024 line:82%
Pakistanis want peace...

777
01:13:42.805 --> 01:13:46.263 line:82%
...so that their children can study
without fear.

778
01:13:46.936 --> 01:13:50.305 line:82%
Prosper and bring honour
to their country.

779
01:13:51.085 --> 01:13:54.020 line:82%
This mission is not only about
saving those nurses...

780
01:13:55.721 --> 01:13:58.643 line:82%
...it's also about restoring respect
to my country.

781
01:14:00.283 --> 01:14:03.096 line:82%
And telling the world that
we stand for peace.

782
01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.604 line:82%
Let's do it together.

783
01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:33.506 line:82%
A joint mission.

784
01:14:35.923 --> 01:14:36.964 line:82%
What?

785
01:14:37.381 --> 01:14:38.339 line:82%
You and I.

786
01:14:38.665 --> 01:14:40.173 line:82%
ISI and RAW.

787
01:14:40.674 --> 01:14:43.466 line:82%
First time. We'll carry out
the mission together.

788
01:14:44.591 --> 01:14:48.216 line:82%
Are you in your right senses?
Have you gone mad?

789
01:14:50.966 --> 01:14:52.716 line:82%
What are you saying, sir?

790
01:14:53.258 --> 01:14:54.883 line:82%
You know we're enemies.

791
01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:57.216 line:82%
A mission with Pakistan?

792
01:14:57.966 --> 01:15:01.841 line:82%
Hear that? Didn't I tell you we'd
just be stirring up muck?

793
01:15:02.174 --> 01:15:04.591 line:82%
Muck? What muck?

794
01:15:05.091 --> 01:15:07.133 line:82%
We arrested some of their men
in Kashmir.

795
01:15:07.674 --> 01:15:10.216 line:82%
- We know what you're up to.
- What?

796
01:15:10.591 --> 01:15:12.674 line:82%
Don't get us talking.

797
01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:14.799 line:82%
- If we did...
- Then?

798
01:15:15.258 --> 01:15:16.924 line:82%
If you can talk, so can we.

799
01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:18.133 line:82%
Wow!

800
01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:20.674 line:82%
That's called true enmity!

801
01:15:24.071 --> 01:15:26.466 line:82%
Rakeshji, logic dictates that...

802
01:15:26.699 --> 01:15:29.799 line:82%
...we'll get in each other's way
if we didn't work together.

803
01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:34.008 line:82%
If we worked together,
there's a chance...

804
01:15:34.549 --> 01:15:38.841 line:82%
...we could send our girls home,
safe and sound.

805
01:15:40.383 --> 01:15:45.357 line:82%
I know there are many problems
between our countries.

806
01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:48.685 line:82%
They may never get resolved.

807
01:15:49.799 --> 01:15:51.466 line:82%
But this is about humanity.

808
01:15:57.216 --> 01:15:58.633 line:82%
You guys...

809
01:15:59.466 --> 01:16:00.633 line:82%
...are trained agents...

810
01:16:00.966 --> 01:16:02.466 line:82%
...adults, matured.

811
01:16:02.883 --> 01:16:04.716 line:82%
Now we'll see if you're...

812
01:16:05.758 --> 01:16:07.758 line:82%
...sensible or not.

813
01:16:10.508 --> 01:16:11.716 line:82%
What about Hassan?

814
01:16:12.008 --> 01:16:14.883 line:82%
Capt. Abrar knows an Iraqi safe house.

815
01:16:15.883 --> 01:16:17.508 line:82%
Hassan can stay there.

816
01:16:24.466 --> 01:16:25.633 line:82%
Where's Junior?

817
01:16:26.127 --> 01:16:28.054 line:82%
I sold him.

818
01:16:29.383 --> 01:16:30.758 line:82%
He's in India.

819
01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:32.383 line:82%
With Zophia.

820
01:16:32.633 --> 01:16:35.091 line:82%
Our son is in India at last.

821
01:16:36.549 --> 01:16:38.591 line:82%
I can't accept it.

822
01:16:39.883 --> 01:16:43.133 line:82%
I know that Tiger's logic
makes sense.

823
01:16:44.924 --> 01:16:48.383 line:82%
I was born around the time
of the Partition...

824
01:16:49.008 --> 01:16:50.716 line:82%
That's when I was born.

825
01:16:51.716 --> 01:16:55.049 line:82%
But imagine this, if the border
had not been drawn...

826
01:16:56.216 --> 01:16:58.549 line:82%
...cricketers Akram and Sachin
would play in the same team.

827
01:16:58.883 --> 01:17:00.841 line:82%
Then all the World Cups
would be ours!

828
01:17:01.549 --> 01:17:02.883 line:82%
You're right!

829
01:17:03.174 --> 01:17:05.049 line:82%
My father would agree with you.

830
01:17:05.383 --> 01:17:06.758 line:82%
Just imagine...

831
01:17:07.091 --> 01:17:09.841 line:82%
...if Lata Bibi, Kishore Kumar,
Mohammed Rafi...

832
01:17:10.133 --> 01:17:13.216 line:82%
...Abida Parveen and Nusrat Fateh
Ali Khan sang on stage together.

833
01:17:13.591 --> 01:17:14.841 line:82%
Just imagine...

834
01:17:15.341 --> 01:17:19.424 line:82%
...if the money that both countries
spend on defense budgets...

835
01:17:19.841 --> 01:17:22.966 line:82%
...could be used instead for roads,
education, power and water...

836
01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:25.008 line:82%
...and cutting unemployment.

837
01:17:25.424 --> 01:17:27.056 line:82%
And Pakistani girls?

838
01:17:30.883 --> 01:17:33.341 line:82%
- They're so beautiful.
- Sir!

839
01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:38.008 line:82%
Remember how Sunny Deol eloped
with a Pakistani in Gadar?

840
01:17:38.424 --> 01:17:39.424 line:82%
- So?
- So what?

841
01:17:39.716 --> 01:17:40.883 line:82%
Big deal!

842
01:17:41.216 --> 01:17:43.258 line:82%
Remember our tennis player
fell in love...

843
01:17:43.508 --> 01:17:44.924 line:82%
...with your Pakistani cricketer?

844
01:17:45.133 --> 01:17:46.799 line:82%
Wonderful, no?

845
01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:49.008 line:82%
But he has lost his touch!

846
01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:51.883 line:82%
You intellectuals!

847
01:18:06.466 --> 01:18:08.133 line:82%
- Zoya Bibi!
- Tiger sir!

848
01:18:19.924 --> 01:18:21.008 line:82%
Your decision?

849
01:18:21.508 --> 01:18:22.299 line:82%
RAW?

850
01:18:22.841 --> 01:18:23.549 line:82%
ISI?

851
01:18:27.008 --> 01:18:28.716 line:82%
Let's work together...

852
01:18:29.216 --> 01:18:31.008 line:82%
...against a common enemy.

853
01:18:31.883 --> 01:18:33.299 line:82%
You mean...

854
01:18:33.716 --> 01:18:37.591 line:82%
...the groom's and the bride's families
will work together?

855
01:20:08.258 --> 01:20:11.664 line:82%
4 DAYS TO AIR STRIKE

856
01:20:19.254 --> 01:20:21.504 line:82%
4 DAYS TO AIRSTRIKE. AMERICAN BASE,
IRAQI NORTHERN BORDER 11AM

857

"The latest coming in from Ikrit,
Iraq is that...

858
01:20:24.504 --> 01:20:26.712 line:82%
"...the ISC hold has become stronger."

01:20:30.587 --> 01:20:33.129 line:82%

"...but the Indian government have
not rescued the nurses as yet."

866
01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.545 line:82%
Tiger has teamed up with ISI
for the mission.

867
01:20:51.504 --> 01:20:52.254 line:82%
But why?

868
01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:54.712 line:82%
Zoya wants to save
the Pakistani nurses.

869
01:20:56.545 --> 01:20:58.629 line:82%
The mission is a family affair now.

870
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:03.879 line:82%
You didn't tell me 15 Pakistani
nurses are held hostage, too?

871
01:21:04.129 --> 01:21:08.440 line:82%
We wanted our nurses to be priority.

872
01:21:08.754 --> 01:21:11.629 line:82%
- And get our girls safely home.
- Shenoy...

873
01:21:11.962 --> 01:21:15.170 line:82%
There are many political problems
between India and Pakistan.

874
01:21:15.795 --> 01:21:19.837 line:82%
But we cannot let politics come
in the way of humanity.

875
01:21:20.254 --> 01:21:24.254 line:82%
Make sure the Indian and the
Pakistani nurses are rescued.

876
01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:27.666 line:82%
- I am with Tiger on this.

I love American breakfast.

Gary, why did you remember me?

886
01:23:14.087 --> 01:23:15.920 line:82%
A few days ago, as I am sure
you are aware...

887
01:23:16.212 --> 01:23:17.754 line:82%
...Abu Usman grabbed three
of our soldiers...

888
01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:20.337 line:82%
...and two civilians, journalists.

889
01:23:22.587 --> 01:23:26.170 line:82%
Journalists...? Or CIA agents?

890
01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.426 line:82%
We need you to find out where
he's keeping them.

891
01:23:32.797 --> 01:23:33.922 line:82%
This is for you.

892
01:23:36.297 --> 01:23:38.755 line:82%
Don't think I'm going
to negotiate.

893
01:23:39.589 --> 01:23:40.672 line:82%
Enough!

894
01:23:41.255 --> 01:23:44.339 line:82%
This is my country, my deal!
Or no deal.

895
01:23:44.672 --> 01:23:46.297 line:82%
- Baghdawi?
- Understand?

896
01:23:47.172 --> 01:23:49.297 line:82%
Baghdawi!
What is he doing here?

897
01:23:50.547 --> 01:23:52.714 line:82%
He came to discuss a back end
oil deal.

898
01:23:53.964 --> 01:23:56.089 line:82%
- You're doing terrorist...
- No, no.

899
01:23:56.589 --> 01:23:58.797 line:82%
- He came as a businessman.
- And?

900
01:24:00.255 --> 01:24:02.922 line:82%
- He asked for too much money.
- So, now?

901
01:24:03.214 --> 01:24:06.047 line:82%
So now he's leaving as a terrorist.

902
01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.672 line:82%
What will you do?

903
01:24:09.839 --> 01:24:12.214 line:82%
What do you think we do to terrorists?

904
01:24:30.922 --> 01:24:31.922 line:82%
Baghdawi!

905
01:24:33.255 --> 01:24:34.964 line:82%
Baghdawi! Stop the car!

906
01:24:36.214 --> 01:24:37.214 line:82%
Stop the car!

907
01:24:37.422 --> 01:24:39.547 line:82%
Stop right there! I'll shoot you.

908
01:24:40.089 --> 01:24:42.547 line:82%
Don't shoot! I am a friend of Amir.

909
01:24:46.089 --> 01:24:47.255 line:82%
Get me drones.

910
01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.047 line:82%
All eyes on target.

911
01:24:49.255 --> 01:24:50.297 line:82%
Stop, stop!

912

Amir! Don't shoot!

913
01:24:55.755 --> 01:24:57.005 line:82%
Don't move!

914
01:24:57.297 --> 01:24:58.714 line:82%
America...blast!

915
01:24:58.932 --> 01:25:00.672 line:82%

He's on the move, sir.

917

Target. Locked.

918
01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:10.464 line:82%
Engage.

The dogs!

954

Because of you my men die.

you morons?

960
01:29:57.297 --> 01:29:59.481 line:82%
They're the morons, not us.

961
01:29:59.672 --> 01:30:03.047 line:82%
They were smoking. I warned them
about the gas leak.

962
01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:05.922 line:82%
They were killed in the explosion.
And we suffered burns.

963
01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:07.880 line:82%
So you survived?

964
01:30:08.172 --> 01:30:10.547 line:82%
You dumb fool, you think I am
an idiot?

965
01:30:10.839 --> 01:30:13.464 line:82%
A bullet's coming your way.
Amir Baghdawi!

966
01:30:13.797 --> 01:30:14.964 line:82%
Stop!

967
01:30:15.922 --> 01:30:16.797 line:82%
Ok!

968
01:30:17.331 --> 01:30:19.346 line:82%
Shoot the rascals!

969
01:30:20.922 --> 01:30:23.787 line:82%
One minute...alone.
Talk.

970
01:30:24.464 --> 01:30:25.880 line:82%
Please.

971
01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:28.630 line:82%
The mission's over.

972
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.630 line:82%
Firdaus is a fox.

973
01:30:31.130 --> 01:30:34.089 line:82%
No, he's not a fox, he's fascinating.

974
01:30:34.505 --> 01:30:37.839 line:82%
Labour, lot of money, Amir.
Expensive.

975
01:30:38.255 --> 01:30:40.755 line:82%
One person, ten thousand dinars.

976
01:30:42.130 --> 01:30:44.380 line:82%
- But my men died.
- Accident.

977
01:30:44.922 --> 01:30:46.339 line:82%
Accidents happen.

978
01:30:46.672 --> 01:30:49.755 line:82%
Twenty-five years I worked here,
accidents happen.

979
01:30:50.089 --> 01:30:51.464 line:82%
I teach them a lesson.

980
01:30:51.797 --> 01:30:52.672 line:82%
I cut them...

981
01:30:54.922 --> 01:30:58.672 line:82%
You kill four... four hundred stop.

982
01:30:59.005 --> 01:31:00.297 line:82%
No work. Strike.

983
01:31:00.714 --> 01:31:02.714 line:82%
Labour very close army...

984
01:31:03.005 --> 01:31:06.047 line:82%
...they no work, no refinery.

985
01:31:06.464 --> 01:31:09.047 line:82%
No money. No oil. Loss.

986
01:31:13.086 --> 01:31:16.258 line:82%
Think with a cool head.

987
01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.255 line:82%
Take them to the hospital!

988
01:31:48.797 --> 01:31:52.922 line:82%
Thanks to you guys, I was nearly
killed today.

989
01:31:53.755 --> 01:31:57.005 line:82%
You think you've escaped
death's claws?

990
01:31:57.922 --> 01:32:02.505 line:82%
I saved you from Baghdawi so that
I could shoot you myself.

991
01:32:03.089 --> 01:32:06.380 line:82%
But first tell me, who are you?

992
01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.589 line:82%
I know you're Indian agents.

993
01:32:11.297 --> 01:32:14.380 line:82%
But I want to know what
you're doing here.

994
01:32:15.922 --> 01:32:17.547 line:82%
Speak up! Or I'll shoot.

995
01:32:21.422 --> 01:32:22.505 line:82%
God forbid!

996
01:32:22.755 --> 01:32:25.339 line:82%
You missed from so close!
You scaring us?

997
01:32:25.797 --> 01:32:30.672 line:82%
I'll open those ears of yours!
Me? Scaring you?

998
01:32:31.172 --> 01:32:35.630 line:82%
Fasten your seat belts tight.
Sister-in-law is here!

999
01:32:44.797 --> 01:32:47.422 line:82%
- Who's the shooter?
- Sister-in-law!

1000
01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:15.922 line:82%
Zoya, I was in that car too.

1001
01:33:17.547 --> 01:33:20.089 line:82%
- Dangerous sister-in-law.
- Right!

1002
01:33:20.672 --> 01:33:22.755 line:82%
- Sorry, sorry.
- Goodbye.

1003
01:33:23.089 --> 01:33:24.755 line:82%
"Tu tu tu tutu tara."

1004
01:33:27.547 --> 01:33:30.422 line:82%
"Tu tu tu tutu tara.
Our friend is here."

1005
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.130 line:82%
You know the code?

1006
01:33:32.505 --> 01:33:35.797 line:82%
I've been RAW's agent in Iraq
for 25 years.

1007
01:33:36.255 --> 01:33:38.422 line:82%
My medals are in Saharanpur.

1008
01:33:38.714 --> 01:33:42.380 line:82%
I've slogged for RAW for years,
and you point a gun at my head?

1009
01:33:42.797 --> 01:33:44.613 line:82%
You show me no respect.

1010
01:33:45.255 --> 01:33:47.547 line:82%
- And Pawan?
- My junior.

1011
01:33:48.047 --> 01:33:50.714 line:82%
If you're RAW, why did you nearly
kill us?

1012
01:33:50.964 --> 01:33:52.339 line:82%
Shenoy said:

1013
01:33:52.589 --> 01:33:56.339 line:82%
"Before they get to the hospital,
scare the living daylights out of them.

1014
01:33:56.589 --> 01:33:58.672 line:82%
"If they break, better sooner
than later."

1015
01:34:03.422 --> 01:34:04.964 line:82%
Shenoy sir!

1016
01:34:09.714 --> 01:34:11.880 line:82%
Shenoy must've given you
a double code.

1017
01:34:12.089 --> 01:34:15.755 line:82%
A single code can only work once.

1018
01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:17.672 line:82%
The double code?

1019
01:34:19.589 --> 01:34:20.714 line:82%
What is it?

1020
01:34:21.964 --> 01:34:23.089 line:82%
Tell me!

1021
01:34:24.047 --> 01:34:25.505 line:82%
"Black lentils."

1022
01:34:26.589 --> 01:34:30.130 line:82%
No one cooks black lentils
better than Tiger.

1023
01:34:36.297 --> 01:34:37.630 line:82%
He's RAW.

1024
01:34:41.172 --> 01:34:43.630 line:82%
Brother, is that Abrar?

1025
01:34:44.130 --> 01:34:46.589 line:82%
The ISI captain? What's going on?

1026
01:34:46.922 --> 01:34:49.339 line:82%
RAW and ISI? Together?

1027
01:34:52.055 --> 01:34:53.907 line:82%
Does the PM know?

1028
01:35:02.297 --> 01:35:05.047 line:82%
Abrar and Javed are pretending
to be ISC guards.

1029
01:35:05.797 --> 01:35:07.547 line:82%
...their IDs will get them into
the hospital.

1030
01:35:08.089 --> 01:35:10.089 line:82%
Pawan said there were only 25 guards.

1031
01:35:10.505 --> 01:35:13.005 line:82%
We have three days
to get the nurses out.

1032
01:35:13.339 --> 01:35:17.464 line:82%
The most important thing...
the hospital floor plan.

1033
01:35:18.172 --> 01:35:19.797 line:82%
It's in the City Council building.

1034
01:35:20.062 --> 01:35:23.005 line:82%
Zoya, you'll find a way
to bring it to us.

1035
01:35:24.797 --> 01:35:26.464 line:82%
Our mission starts now.

1036
01:35:30.630 --> 01:35:31.839 line:82%
Firdaus...

1037
01:35:35.339 --> 01:35:36.422 line:82%
Let's do it!

1038
01:35:41.672 --> 01:35:43.505 line:82%
Take care of yourself.

1039
01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:21.839 line:82%
Isn't the security too tight?

1040
01:36:23.089 --> 01:36:24.172 line:82%
Something's wrong.

1041
01:36:24.505 --> 01:36:25.339 line:82%
Stop!

1042
01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:34.089 line:82%
ID?

1043
01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.255 line:82%
- ID?
- Me! ID.

1044
01:36:37.589 --> 01:36:40.047 line:82%
Baghdawi refinery accident.

1045
01:36:41.172 --> 01:36:43.089 line:82%
Burn victims. Hospital.

1046
01:36:43.547 --> 01:36:44.380 line:82%
Ok.

1047
01:36:47.297 --> 01:36:50.422 line:82%
Why so many people here?

1048
01:36:58.255 --> 01:36:59.214 line:82%
Well?

1049
01:36:59.672 --> 01:37:03.755 line:82%
Didn't you check your horoscope
before this mission?

1050
01:37:06.214 --> 01:37:08.214 line:82%
All your planets are haywire.

1051
01:37:10.214 --> 01:37:13.964 line:82%
Last night the Americans bombed Mosul.

1052
01:37:16.089 --> 01:37:19.255 line:82%
So Abu Usman has made this hospital
his base.

1053
01:37:21.464 --> 01:37:26.172 line:82%
This hospital is now ISC's biggest
base in Ikrit.

1054
01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.630 line:82%
Now get the nurses out!

1055
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.047 line:82%
- 300 guards?
- Correct, sir.

1056
01:38:11.464 --> 01:38:14.422 line:82%
Firdaus says the hospital is
Abu Usman's main base.

1057
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.922 line:82%
Using the nurses as a decoy,
Abu Usman is planning a major attack.

1058
01:38:20.714 --> 01:38:23.297 line:82%
Do you have a back-up plan?

1059
01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:25.172 line:82%
War.

1060
01:38:26.255 --> 01:38:28.839 line:82%
- Are you sure, Shenoy?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:38:29.255 --> 01:38:33.005 line:82%
Military intelligence says we must
talk to Iran.

1062
01:38:33.464 --> 01:38:37.214 line:82%
We need helicopters, naval ships
in the Arabian Gulf...

1063
01:38:37.464 --> 01:38:40.714 line:82%
...and Air Force support ready.

1064
01:38:41.797 --> 01:38:42.547 line:82%
Karan...

1065
01:38:43.130 --> 01:38:45.672 line:82%
Go to Iraq. Immediately.

1066
01:38:46.505 --> 01:38:48.547 line:82%
I need someone I can trust there.

1067
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.214 line:82%
"The Prime Minister has finally
ordered...

1068
01:38:51.422 --> 01:38:53.880 line:82%
"...INS Mysore, a guided missile
destroyer...

1069
01:38:54.172 --> 01:38:57.839 line:82%
"...and INS Tarkash to be dispatched
to the Arabian Gulf...

1070
01:38:58.255 --> 01:39:00.547 line:82%
"...to bring home the trapped
nurses."

1071
01:39:00.922 --> 01:39:02.880 line:82%
CITY COUNCIL, IKRIT

1072
01:39:41.339 --> 01:39:42.922 line:82%
Take them in!

1073
01:39:45.672 --> 01:39:48.089 line:82%
Move them. Hurry!

1074
01:40:25.047 --> 01:40:26.797 line:82%
Do you speak Arabic?

1075
01:40:34.672 --> 01:40:35.922 line:82%
English?

1076
01:40:40.714 --> 01:40:41.547 line:82%
Urdu?

1077
01:40:43.797 --> 01:40:45.005 line:82%
Farsi?

1078
01:40:48.422 --> 01:40:49.922 line:82%
What do you want?

1079
01:40:50.255 --> 01:40:52.505 line:82%
I must get into the City Council
building.

1080
01:40:53.005 --> 01:40:54.255 line:82%
It's urgent.

1081
01:40:54.672 --> 01:40:57.130 line:82%
You don't know what goes on there.

1082
01:40:58.755 --> 01:41:01.672 line:82%
My village is in Afghanistan
on the Pakistan border.

1083
01:41:02.214 --> 01:41:04.714 line:82%
I came here to study
at the medical college.

1084
01:41:05.422 --> 01:41:07.964 line:82%
Some of the girls and I
were abducted...

1085
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:09.714 line:82%
...from the college.

1086
01:41:10.047 --> 01:41:12.922 line:82%
They said that girls
should not be studying.

1087
01:41:13.922 --> 01:41:16.297 line:82%
They took us to the
City Council building.

1088
01:41:17.152 --> 01:41:19.422 line:82%
We had to mop the floors.

1089
01:41:20.464 --> 01:41:22.422 line:82%
Baghdawi and his men showed up.

1090
01:41:23.172 --> 01:41:24.797 line:82%
They beat us.

1091
01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:28.297 line:82%
They forced themselves on us.

1092
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:32.922 line:82%
Any girl who tried to escape
was shot.

1093
01:41:34.339 --> 01:41:36.797 line:82%
We are forced to go there
every day.

1094
01:41:38.464 --> 01:41:41.297 line:82%
We have to scrub the floors.

1095
01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:46.255 line:82%
On those same floors, they...

1096
01:42:36.714 --> 01:42:39.964 line:82%
- How were you burned?
- A fire in the refinery.

1097
01:42:40.339 --> 01:42:41.422 line:82%
That's how.

1098
01:42:41.672 --> 01:42:43.297 line:82%
Did you light that fire?

1099
01:42:44.672 --> 01:42:47.214 line:82%
You have anti-fire gel on your skin.

1100
01:42:47.547 --> 01:42:50.464 line:82%
We're RAW agents. We're here to
get you out.

1101
01:42:51.047 --> 01:42:54.214 line:82%
This is my team. Don't react.

1102
01:42:54.714 --> 01:42:55.714 line:82%
Keep listening.

1103
01:42:56.130 --> 01:42:59.380 line:82%
If we don't get you out in 2 days...

1104
01:42:59.839 --> 01:43:02.630 line:82%
...the Americans will start bombing.
Then we're all dead.

1105
01:43:03.047 --> 01:43:05.630 line:82%
We were told there are
40 nurses here.

1106
01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:06.714 line:82%
39.

1107
01:43:07.714 --> 01:43:10.380 line:82%
A Pakistani nurse was shot
2 days ago.

1108
01:43:11.130 --> 01:43:13.755 line:82%
Escaping is impossible.

1109
01:43:15.172 --> 01:43:18.214 line:82%
They're animals, not men.
And Abu Usman...

1110
01:43:29.505 --> 01:43:31.008 line:82%
...is everywhere.

1111
01:43:33.422 --> 01:43:34.881 line:82%
Here he comes.

1112
01:43:49.255 --> 01:43:51.841 line:82%
Will you change my dressing, Poorna?

1113
01:43:54.922 --> 01:43:57.589 line:82%
- Are you an Indian?
- Yes.

1114
01:43:59.755 --> 01:44:02.297 line:82%
You must be happy today,
Miss Poorna.

1115
01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:09.214 line:82%
Nice meeting someone in a foreign land
from back home.

1116
01:44:11.255 --> 01:44:14.130 line:82%
- Your name?

Yes. Just 4.

And the others?

1126
01:44:41.130 --> 01:44:43.172 line:82%
- Are you from the Baghdawi refinery?
- Yes.

1127
01:44:44.797 --> 01:44:47.005 line:82%
Your government is doing nothing.

1128
01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:52.339 line:82%
They're not saving the many Indians
trapped here in Iraq.

An injection, if it's a serious case.

1183

- Does it make them drowsy?
- No.

1184

We usually sedate patients
before surgery.

1185

- How's the supply of sedatives?

1186

We'll just check that, sir.

1187

Their death won't go in vain.

1204

Every single person among us
will avenge their death.

1205

It is not easy to break us.

1206
01:53:10.672 --> 01:53:14.339 line:82%
To destroy our thoughts,
beliefs and our army.

1207
01:53:16.005 --> 01:53:19.505 line:82%
Time for revolution. To show
the world our power...

1208
01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:21.797 line:82%
Sir, the sedatives.

1209
01:53:26.464 --> 01:53:28.797 line:82%
- Call everyone for the speech.
- Ok, copy.

1210
01:53:29.839 --> 01:53:32.172 line:82%
Hurry! The speech has started.

1211
01:53:32.464 --> 01:53:35.089 line:82%
We won't let anyone do what
they want on our land...

1212
01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:36.839 line:82%
...for their own benefit.

1213
01:53:37.464 --> 01:53:38.422 line:82%
How are you?

1214
01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.297 line:82%
They bomb our cities.

1215
01:53:40.714 --> 01:53:42.214 line:82%
They kill our families...

1216
01:53:42.714 --> 01:53:45.755 line:82%
...our fathers, mothers, brothers
and sisters...

1217
01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:47.464 line:82%
...and they call us terrorists.

1218
01:53:48.047 --> 01:53:51.172 line:82%
I've checked, sir. We have
150 sedative injections.

1219
01:53:51.547 --> 01:53:54.755 line:82%
Hurry, switch the labels.
Namit, help them.

1220
01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:08.797 line:82%
You have to decide who's the victim.

1221
01:54:09.547 --> 01:54:11.172 line:82%
Us? Or them?

1222
01:54:12.172 --> 01:54:13.047 line:82%
Make sure...

1223
01:54:13.255 --> 01:54:16.797 line:82%
...the labels read food poisoning
medication.

1224
01:54:23.297 --> 01:54:24.339 line:82%
Lighter?

1225
01:54:27.047 --> 01:54:28.130 line:82%
Thank you.

1226
01:54:38.422 --> 01:54:39.880 line:82%
Ready to die?

1227
01:54:41.255 --> 01:54:42.755 line:82%
Are you ready to die?

1228
01:54:44.922 --> 01:54:46.255 line:82%
Victory is ours!

1229
01:54:49.922 --> 01:54:51.339 line:82%
Victory is ours!

1230
01:54:55.442 --> 01:54:58.864 line:82%
Victory is ours!

1231
01:55:06.755 --> 01:55:10.380 line:82%
Rakeshji, are you sure
you mixed the powder in?

1232
01:55:10.755 --> 01:55:12.547 line:82%
They look fine.

1233
01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:16.505 line:82%
I mixed phenol pills
with ammonia.

1234
01:55:16.839 --> 01:55:20.047 line:82%
Just wait. Their bellies will soon
be on fire.

1235
01:55:22.755 --> 01:55:24.005 line:82%
Azaan...

1236
01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:26.442 line:82%
...what are you looking for?

1237
01:55:26.636 --> 01:55:30.297 line:82%
Once the nurses are freed,
where to hoist our flag?

1238
01:55:30.547 --> 01:55:31.708 line:82%
What?

1239
01:55:31.934 --> 01:55:34.964 line:82%
- You brought your flag too?
- Who else has a flag?

1240
01:55:44.464 --> 01:55:48.380 line:82%
Clearly emotions run high
on both sides of the border.

1241
01:55:56.130 --> 01:55:57.172 line:82%
What's wrong?

1242
01:56:00.297 --> 01:56:02.797 line:82%
See that? They're dropping
like flies.

1244
01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:18.630 line:82%
- How many men are down?
- Nearly half, sir.

1245
01:56:24.797 --> 01:56:26.089 line:82%
How bad is he?

1246
01:56:26.422 --> 01:56:28.255 line:82%
An extreme case of food poisoning.

1247
01:56:28.797 --> 01:56:31.422 line:82%
We've given him glucose.
But he can't hold anything down.

1248
01:56:31.755 --> 01:56:36.464 line:82%
We must give him an injection,
a heavy dose. It will work.

1249
01:56:48.547 --> 01:56:49.505 line:82%
Stop!

1250
01:56:55.047 --> 01:56:56.630 line:82%
Get those 4 Indians.

1251
01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:10.964 line:82%
Not that one.

1252
01:57:14.839 --> 01:57:15.797 line:82%
Here.

1253
01:57:28.672 --> 01:57:29.880 line:82%
Not him.

1254
01:57:35.714 --> 01:57:36.839 line:82%
Inject him.

1255
01:58:29.505 --> 01:58:32.297 line:82%
Administer the injection
to all the sick men.

There's been an attack
at the northern check post.

1264
02:00:24.047 --> 02:00:25.589 line:82%
Sir, we've given them
the sedatives.

1265
02:00:25.839 --> 02:00:27.672 line:82%
The guards won't wake up
for three hours.

1266
02:00:29.797 --> 02:00:31.005 line:82%
Nor will Azaan.

1267
02:00:32.630 --> 02:00:37.089 line:82%
As planned, half the men are down.
The other half is with Abu Usman.

1268
02:00:37.672 --> 02:00:38.880 line:82%
No time to waste...

1269
02:00:40.797 --> 02:00:41.839 line:82%
...let's go.

1270
02:00:44.339 --> 02:00:46.130 line:82%
Post disarmed.

1271
02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:49.005 line:82%
Hi, guys. Our job's done.
Now get out of there.

1272
02:00:49.297 --> 02:00:51.089 line:82%
Copy that. Move out now.

1273
02:00:55.339 --> 02:00:56.797 line:82%
Move out now!

1274
02:00:57.297 --> 02:00:59.047 line:82%
Move! Move! Let's go.

1275
02:00:59.339 --> 02:01:01.964 line:82%
- Let's give it a few minutes.
- We got our orders.

1276
02:01:07.172 --> 02:01:09.172 line:82%
The shooting has stopped.

1277
02:01:09.672 --> 02:01:11.005 line:82%
Copy. Amir.

1278
02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:14.047 line:82%
The shooting at the check post
has suddenly stopped.

1279
02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.130 line:82%
It's a decoy.

1280
02:02:14.255 --> 02:02:15.964 line:82%
Thanks be to God.

1281
02:02:22.839 --> 02:02:24.047 line:82%
Hold fire!

1282
02:02:32.172 --> 02:02:34.964 line:82%
I can see someone
on the second floor.

1283
02:04:20.089 --> 02:04:22.047 line:82%
She's a strong woman.

1284
02:04:22.825 --> 02:04:25.797 line:82%
My guards tell me it took a while
restraining her.

1285
02:04:27.214 --> 02:04:29.922 line:82%
And what she did to Baghdawi.

1286
02:04:30.297 --> 02:04:33.589 line:82%
- She has shaken the Caliphate.
- Usman!

1287
02:04:34.172 --> 02:04:38.505 line:82%
If you touch her again,
I'll bury you alive right here.

1288
02:04:42.755 --> 02:04:44.047 line:82%
Tiger...

1289
02:04:44.839 --> 02:04:46.255 line:82%
...isn't that your name?

1290
02:04:48.130 --> 02:04:52.089 line:82%
You managed to do what both
your countries couldn't do.

1291
02:04:52.714 --> 02:04:56.505 line:82%
Getting India and Pakistan
working on a mission together.

1292
02:04:58.047 --> 02:05:00.505 line:82%
You must be a very
charismatic man, Tiger.

1293
02:05:00.739 --> 02:05:03.589 line:82%
And what are you? A hero?

1294
02:05:04.339 --> 02:05:07.464 line:82%
Waging war on the pretext
of religion.

1295
02:05:07.964 --> 02:05:11.505 line:82%
What do you think? This war
is about religion?

1296
02:05:12.130 --> 02:05:15.797 line:82%
Do you get your information
from the western media?

1297
02:05:18.089 --> 02:05:21.839 line:82%
Where do these bombs, weapons
and money come from?

1298
02:05:22.297 --> 02:05:24.089 line:82%
Who provides them to us?

1299
02:05:25.255 --> 02:05:27.547 line:82%
This war is business.

1300
02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:29.630 line:82%
The whole world's in it.

1301
02:05:30.422 --> 02:05:32.547 line:82%
We're the ones seen
on ground zero.

1302
02:05:33.172 --> 02:05:35.839 line:82%
But the whole world is profiting.

1303
02:05:37.047 --> 02:05:40.964 line:82%
To control this business,
you need power.

1304
02:05:41.464 --> 02:05:44.922 line:82%
And the one who is powerful
controls fear.

1305
02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:47.922 line:82%
Today...

1306
02:05:48.464 --> 02:05:50.464 line:82%
...when you're with your family...

1307
02:05:50.839 --> 02:05:54.464 line:82%
...on the beach or in a mall,
or taking a flight...

1308
02:05:56.130 --> 02:05:58.922 line:82%
...don't you fear
a suicide bomber?

1309
02:06:01.755 --> 02:06:05.089 line:82%
This widespread terror
in the world today...

1310
02:06:05.505 --> 02:06:07.589 line:82%
...that is our strength, Tiger.

1311
02:06:07.922 --> 02:06:12.005 line:82%
So you strap a bomb on Hassan, a kid,
and stand him in a crowd.

1312
02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:16.172 line:82%
For your own interests you brainwash
innocents with hate speeches.

1313
02:06:16.755 --> 02:06:18.672 line:82%
Is that your business investment?

1314
02:06:20.214 --> 02:06:22.755 line:82%
The genesis of this world began
with humanity.

1315
02:06:23.047 --> 02:06:25.672 line:82%
Today the world needs only
one religion...

1316
02:06:26.005 --> 02:06:28.047 line:82%
...and that is humanity.

1317
02:06:28.422 --> 02:06:29.839 line:82%
I know, Tiger.

1318
02:06:30.255 --> 02:06:32.672 line:82%
Your philosophy only works in theory.

1319
02:06:33.797 --> 02:06:36.880 line:82%
We've followed your plan till now.

1320
02:06:37.422 --> 02:06:38.880 line:82%
Now listen to mine.

1321
02:06:40.130 --> 02:06:43.672 line:82%
The Americans will bomb
this hospital shortly.

1322
02:06:44.422 --> 02:06:45.589 line:82%
And you...

1323
02:06:45.964 --> 02:06:47.130 line:82%
...your team...

1324
02:06:47.380 --> 02:06:49.255 line:82%
...and these nurses - all dead.

1325
02:06:49.797 --> 02:06:52.130 line:82%
The Americans will think
they killed me.

1326
02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:56.589 line:82%
The whole world will celebrate
for a few hours.

1327
02:06:57.047 --> 02:07:00.130 line:82%
"The most wanted man on the planet
is dead."

1328
02:07:01.964 --> 02:07:04.297 line:82%
And after that...

1329
02:07:05.047 --> 02:07:06.880 line:82%
...a video will be released.

1330
02:07:07.172 --> 02:07:11.672 line:82%
Showing me executing thirty foreigners
en masse.

1331
02:07:12.464 --> 02:07:15.255 line:82%
That will be my revenge, Tiger.

1332
02:07:24.368 --> 02:07:25.248 line:82%
HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL GAS

1333
02:07:26.630 --> 02:07:27.922 line:82%
Take a good look.

1334
02:07:31.964 --> 02:07:34.964 line:82%
The minute you inhale the gas...

1335
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:39.672 line:82%
...all your past happy years
with her...

1336
02:07:40.130 --> 02:07:44.505 line:82%
...will flash before your eyes
for an instant.

1337
02:07:48.172 --> 02:07:49.339 line:82%
Ryan, take her.

1338
02:07:59.339 --> 02:08:03.797 line:82%
Tiger, if you have the guts,
stop me.

1339
02:08:08.090 --> 02:08:09.047 line:82%
Usman...

1340
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:11.297 line:82%
...if you have the guts...

1341
02:08:11.714 --> 02:08:12.964 line:82%
...then...

1342
02:08:14.630 --> 02:08:15.964 line:82%
...you stop me.

1343
02:08:20.714 --> 02:08:23.505 line:82%
Bring our nurses home!

1344
02:08:24.964 --> 02:08:26.755 line:82%
- Adam.
- 30 minutes.

1345
02:08:27.922 --> 02:08:29.464 line:82%
I need more time, Adam.

1346
02:08:29.672 --> 02:08:31.422 line:82%
30 minutes. That's all you got,
Shenoy.

1347
02:08:31.630 --> 02:08:33.797 line:82%
I'm sorry, we have our orders.
We're moving in.

1348
02:08:52.547 --> 02:08:53.464 line:82%
Bad news.

1349
02:08:53.839 --> 02:08:55.255 line:82%
Tiger was caught.

1350
02:08:57.630 --> 02:08:58.339 line:82%
Yes, sir?

1351
02:08:58.672 --> 02:09:00.630 line:82%
We have only 30 minutes.

1352
02:09:00.839 --> 02:09:02.047 line:82%
30 minutes?

1353
02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:03.255 line:82%
Yes.

1354
02:09:04.214 --> 02:09:05.547 line:82%
That's it.

1355
02:09:06.964 --> 02:09:09.422 line:82%
- What 30 minutes?
- The American air strike starts.

1356
02:09:09.630 --> 02:09:12.672 line:82%
30 minutes? Must we oil our scalps
in the meantime?

1357
02:09:13.005 --> 02:09:14.589 line:82%
Are they crazy?

1358
02:09:17.547 --> 02:09:18.422 line:82%
Oil!

1359
02:09:20.505 --> 02:09:21.339 line:82%
Oil!

1360
02:09:24.089 --> 02:09:25.005 line:82%
Let's go.

1361
02:11:01.255 --> 02:11:02.505 line:82%
Long live Lord Hanuman!

1362
02:11:05.422 --> 02:11:07.380 line:82%
Your blood pressure ok?

1363
02:11:07.672 --> 02:11:11.089 line:82%
I thought the Lord of Death
had brushed past me today.

1364
02:11:26.005 --> 02:11:27.130 line:82%
Amir.

1365
02:11:29.005 --> 02:11:30.422 line:82%
Tiger is alive.

1366
02:11:31.089 --> 02:11:34.005 line:82%
I won't leave this hospital...

1367
02:11:34.339 --> 02:11:36.130 line:82%
...till I see his dead body.

1368
02:11:37.714 --> 02:11:38.672 line:82%
Go!

1369
02:11:59.672 --> 02:12:01.005 line:82%
Grab it all!

1370
02:13:15.255 --> 02:13:18.797 line:82%
All the bombs are connected to her
vest. They could explode.

1371
02:13:19.089 --> 02:13:21.297 line:82%
Shut up, Namit!
You have 4 minutes.

1372
02:13:21.464 --> 02:13:23.964 line:82%
Sir, this is what I do.
This is impossible.

1373
02:13:24.214 --> 02:13:25.089 line:82%
Please sir.

1374
02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:27.380 line:82%
They can't all die because of me.

1375
02:13:27.797 --> 02:13:28.589 line:82%
Come here.

1376
02:13:29.964 --> 02:13:31.339 line:82%
I won't hear a "no."

1377
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:33.297 line:82%
Please understand.
This is not possible.

1378
02:13:35.922 --> 02:13:36.880 line:82%
Look at them.

1379
02:13:39.130 --> 02:13:42.797 line:82%
It's our mission to take them all
home alive.

1380
02:13:43.755 --> 02:13:44.964 line:82%
Namit...

1381
02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:48.922 line:82%
Responsibility is entrusted
by God to a very few.

1382
02:13:49.464 --> 02:13:51.630 line:82%
Only the lucky are so blessed.

1383
02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:54.422 line:82%
Don't let yourself down, man.

1384
02:13:57.297 --> 02:13:59.714 line:82%
If I come, I come with Poorna.

1385
02:14:01.047 --> 02:14:03.589 line:82%
If not, I salute you.
Sat Sri Akal.

1386
02:14:06.130 --> 02:14:08.005 line:82%
She'll be fine. Let's go.

1387
02:14:10.505 --> 02:14:13.589 line:82%
Move into the left gate. And you,
move into the right gate. Now!

1388
02:14:14.922 --> 02:14:17.922 line:82%
Just do me a favour. Don't look down.
Look at me.

1389
02:14:19.047 --> 02:14:20.589 line:82%
Keep looking at me, Poorna.

1390
02:14:21.964 --> 02:14:22.922 line:82%
Just...

1391
02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:26.339 line:82%
...tell my mother...

1392
02:14:28.047 --> 02:14:29.172 line:82%
...I didn't give up.

1393
02:14:30.547 --> 02:14:32.255 line:82%
Didn't stop trying.

1394
02:14:34.922 --> 02:14:36.089 line:82%
I didn't give up.

1395
02:14:37.005 --> 02:14:39.505 line:82%
Tell my father...

1396
02:14:42.255 --> 02:14:43.755 line:82%
I really loved him.

1397
02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:49.297 line:82%
Azaan, in the middle.
Abrar, at the back.

1398
02:14:50.130 --> 02:14:51.464 line:82%
Black?

1399
02:14:54.297 --> 02:14:56.339 line:82%
No, red.

1400
02:14:59.505 --> 02:15:00.255 line:82%
Red!

1401
02:15:07.714 --> 02:15:08.630 line:82%
What is it?

1402
02:15:08.964 --> 02:15:12.130 line:82%
No red wire in the last circuit.
We must prise open the vest.

1403
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:17.255 line:82%
Fifteen minutes to strike!

1404
02:15:17.672 --> 02:15:19.214 line:82%
Let's get drones up and ready.

1405
02:16:01.464 --> 02:16:02.589 line:82%
Jiya, my friend.

1406
02:16:04.464 --> 02:16:05.505 line:82%
Sat Sri Akal!

1407
02:16:11.547 --> 02:16:14.547 line:82%
- Anyone following?
- Not a soul. Step on it!

1408
02:16:19.047 --> 02:16:20.880 line:82%
Bravo, Rakeshji.
Right on time.

1409
02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:28.339 line:82%
Everyone out of here.
Let's go. Now!

1410
02:16:50.755 --> 02:16:52.172 line:82%
Long live Lord Hanuman!

1411
02:16:53.255 --> 02:16:54.964 line:82%
Everyone, take position.

1412
02:17:20.089 --> 02:17:21.422 line:82%
The whole army is here.

1413
02:17:22.005 --> 02:17:23.130 line:82%
Don't worry.

1414
02:17:24.005 --> 02:17:25.255 line:82%
Tiger is alive.

1415
02:19:18.448 --> 02:19:20.005 line:82%
Sir, too many guards about.

1416
02:19:21.714 --> 02:19:24.089 line:82%
- Any ammunition?
- A few rounds, sir.

1417
02:19:28.005 --> 02:19:29.839 line:82%
Azaan, my magazine is empty.

1418
02:19:30.047 --> 02:19:32.464 line:82%
Abrar, go. I'll cover you.

1419
02:19:32.714 --> 02:19:33.547 line:82%
Now!

1420
02:19:40.172 --> 02:19:41.339 line:82%
Azaan, you ok?

1421
02:19:42.130 --> 02:19:44.005 line:82%
I'm ok. Stay down!

1422
02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:48.505 line:82%
The others need you. Go.

1423
02:19:48.755 --> 02:19:50.964 line:82%
No, Azaan. Come with me.
Come!

1424
02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:53.005 line:82%
One of us must stay here.
Go!

1425
02:19:53.464 --> 02:19:55.714 line:82%
- Rakeshji...
- I haven't fired a single bullet.

1426
02:19:56.047 --> 02:19:57.880 line:82%
Switch guns. Take the nurses in.

1427
02:19:58.130 --> 02:19:59.630 line:82%
Move it! Let's go.

1428
02:20:01.672 --> 02:20:02.589 line:82%
Take this.

1429
02:20:11.797 --> 02:20:12.672 line:82%
Just...

1430
02:20:14.005 --> 02:20:14.880 line:82%
...go!

1431
02:20:42.755 --> 02:20:43.922 line:82%
Where's Azaan?

1432
02:20:57.547 --> 02:20:58.380 line:82%
Move!

1433
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:02.672 line:82%
Ready?

1434
02:22:18.380 --> 02:22:21.089 line:82%
Karan, Firdaus. Get the nurses out.

1435
02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:24.089 line:82%
The way out is blocked.
ISC have orders...

1436
02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:27.714 line:82%
...until Abu Usman leaves,
no one else does.

1437
02:22:28.005 --> 02:22:30.589 line:82%
- How much time have we got?
- Ten minutes.

1438
02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:33.755 line:82%
Firdaus. Namit. Take care
of the nurses.

1439
02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:35.380 line:82%
Come with me.

1440
02:23:02.672 --> 02:23:03.854 line:82%
Get it?

1441
02:23:04.214 --> 02:23:05.547 line:82%
Take care of it.

1442
02:24:15.964 --> 02:24:17.839 line:82%
You're unstoppable, Tiger.

1443
02:24:18.672 --> 02:24:19.755 line:82%
Amazing!

1444
02:24:24.714 --> 02:24:26.255 line:82%
Now she must die.

1445
02:24:31.725 --> 02:24:32.726 line:82%
Zoya!

1446
02:25:19.672 --> 02:25:21.797 line:82%
Know why RAW calls me "Tiger?"

1447
02:25:22.339 --> 02:25:25.547 line:82%
Because nothing is more dangerous
than a wounded tiger.

1448
02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:30.214 line:82%
You didn't get it?
The tables have turned.

1449
02:25:30.922 --> 02:25:34.297 line:82%
God will decide if He forgives you
or not.

1450
02:25:34.672 --> 02:25:38.005 line:82%
My job is to send you to Him.

1451
02:25:39.089 --> 02:25:42.589 line:82%
The nurses are going to leave
with my team.

1452
02:25:42.922 --> 02:25:44.214 line:82%
All the hostages too.

1453
02:25:44.714 --> 02:25:46.797 line:82%
Who will free them? You will.

1454
02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:49.172 line:82%
Tomorrow's headlines will read:

1455
02:25:50.047 --> 02:25:54.547 line:82%
"The most wanted man on planet earth
is dead."

1456
02:25:54.755 --> 02:25:55.797 line:82%
Firdaus!

1457
02:25:56.172 --> 02:25:58.589 line:82%
Take him away. He'll be dead
in 5 minutes.

1458
02:25:59.005 --> 02:26:00.797 line:82%
The air strike will start.
Let's go.

1459
02:26:01.255 --> 02:26:02.714 line:82%
Not without Zoya.

1460
02:26:03.297 --> 02:26:05.380 line:82%
- It's suicide, sir.
- Trust me.

1461
02:26:06.339 --> 02:26:07.047 line:82%
Leave!

1462
02:26:09.422 --> 02:26:10.755 line:82%
One minute to strike.

1463
02:26:14.922 --> 02:26:16.255 line:82%
Prime Minister on the line.

1464
02:26:30.196 --> 02:26:33.637 line:82%
Stop, stop the car!

1465
02:26:36.089 --> 02:26:37.464 line:82%
No gun. No.

1466
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:39.880 line:82%
Amir, Amir hurt. Open, fast.

1467
02:26:40.255 --> 02:26:41.714 line:82%
Amir? Amir, are you ok?

1468
02:26:42.797 --> 02:26:44.505 line:82%
Talk to me. Are you ok?

1469
02:26:44.755 --> 02:26:46.297 line:82%
What's in the bus?

1470
02:26:46.505 --> 02:26:47.630 line:82%
American hostages.

1471
02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:50.214 line:82%
Amir's plan is to execute them.

1472
02:26:50.589 --> 02:26:52.464 line:82%
Go, go! Check the bus.

1473
02:26:53.505 --> 02:26:55.922 line:82%
Amir, are you ok? Talk to me.
Are you ok?

1474
02:27:13.172 --> 02:27:15.005 line:82%
He's right. There are hostages
in the bus.

1475
02:27:16.172 --> 02:27:16.922 line:82%
Please!

1476
02:27:17.214 --> 02:27:18.755 line:82%
Ok. Go!

1477
02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.214 line:82%
Thank you.

1478
02:27:28.464 --> 02:27:31.339 line:82%
Target in sight, sir.
Ten seconds till strike.

1479
02:27:35.609 --> 02:27:39.714 line:82%
Tiger, just leave me and go.

1480
02:27:41.714 --> 02:27:44.031 line:82%
One of us must live.

1481
02:27:45.005 --> 02:27:45.964 line:82%
For Junior.

1482
02:27:46.464 --> 02:27:47.214 line:82%
Three...

1483
02:27:47.714 --> 02:27:49.339 line:82%
Two, one.

1484
02:27:49.755 --> 02:27:50.422 line:82%
Fire!

1485
02:27:54.589 --> 02:27:56.217 line:82%
Look after our son.

1486
02:28:00.672 --> 02:28:02.130 line:82%
And tell him I love him.

1487
02:28:51.755 --> 02:28:52.380 line:82%
Yes?

1488
02:28:52.714 --> 02:28:54.755 line:82%
Mission accomplished.
We're out.

1489
02:28:55.214 --> 02:28:58.130 line:82%
With Tiger? Or without Tiger?

1490
02:28:58.839 --> 02:28:59.756 line:82%
Without Tiger.

1491
02:29:04.797 --> 02:29:06.255 line:82%
All the nurses are safe.

1492
02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:09.422 line:82%
We got them out.

1493
02:29:11.005 --> 02:29:12.589 line:82%
Connect me to the Prime Minister.

1494
02:29:20.422 --> 02:29:23.339 line:82%
Azaan saved your life.

1495
02:29:24.422 --> 02:29:27.797 line:82%
In the name of humanity,
it's his right and your duty.

1496
02:29:43.464 --> 02:29:44.589 line:82%
Javed, my friend...

1497
02:29:45.255 --> 02:29:47.089 line:82%
...fly your flag too!

1498
02:29:59.505 --> 02:30:01.297 line:82%
Well done, Tiger!

1499
02:30:09.191 --> 02:30:12.882 line:82%
You'll hear a little whistling.

1500
02:30:13.251 --> 02:30:14.297 line:82%
Bye bye.

1501
02:30:14.538 --> 02:30:15.179 line:82%

11:59PM

1503
02:31:06.714 --> 02:31:08.297 line:82%
- Sir?
- Yes, Karan?

1504
02:31:10.089 --> 02:31:15.172 line:82%
There's an email with a coded message
in Greek: "Saare jahaan se achha."

1505
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:20.880 line:82%
Hello?

1506
02:31:22.698 --> 02:31:23.768 line:82%
Hello?

1507

Greetings on Independence day.

You knew if you had returned
with those nurses...

1509
02:31:33.505 --> 02:31:35.505 line:82%
...RAW would never let you go.

1510
02:31:40.714 --> 02:31:42.630 line:82%
Remember, sir...

1511
02:31:43.268 --> 02:31:45.130 line:82%
...if my country ever needs me...

1512
02:31:47.005 --> 02:31:48.839 line:82%
...Tiger is alive!

1513
02:32:03.255 --> 02:32:04.422 line:82%

02:32:28.797 --> 02:32:30.255 line:82%
'Coz you know there ain't
no other way

1516
02:32:33.547 --> 02:32:34.630 line:82%
Love is the message

1517
02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:38.339 line:82%
You ready?

1518
02:32:38.755 --> 02:32:39.505 line:82%

Yeah... all you got is me and...

1522
02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:48.714 line:82%
Yeah... all I got is you

1523
02:33:02.672 --> 02:33:04.464 line:82%
