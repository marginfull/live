00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.250 line:80%
IN THE NAME OF GOD

2
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:31.250 line:80%
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY.

3
00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:54.583 line:80%
God is great!

4
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:29.958 line:80%
NOT AN ANGEL'S LOVE

5
00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.208 line:80%
You had better break up
with my brother, Adam!

6
00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:54.208 line:80%
Oh, God.

7
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:59.125 line:80%
Dear God, please strengthen my will
to forget Adam.

8
00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:14.125 line:80%
Thank you, Grandma, for bringing me here.

9
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.042 line:80%
This is all God's will.

10
00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:19.167 line:80%
I know

11
00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:23.625 line:80%
that God has planned
something good for you, Dewi.

12
00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.542 line:80%
Stop! Don't move! Arrest her!

13
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:25.333 line:80%
Arrest her.

14
00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:29.500 line:80%
Huh? What is this? Let me go!

15
00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:30.792 line:80%
Please, let me go!

16
00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:32.625 line:80%
That's not mine! Let me go!

17
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:37.417 line:80%
Sir, you arrested the wrong person.

18
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.333 line:80%
I'm a congregation member from Malaysia.

19
00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:41.917 line:80%
Sir…

20
00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:44.708 line:80%
You have to let me go, sir.

21
00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:46.000 line:80%
Help me, sir!

22
00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.042 line:80%
-Daud?
-Yes.

23
00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.542 line:80%
I'm a congregation member.
I have no bad intentions.

24
00:03:52.042 --> 00:03:53.583 line:80%
How are you? Come and sit.

25
00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:00.542 line:80%
Sir.

26
00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.333 line:80%
Why did you throw it?

27
00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:13.667 line:80%
No, sir! I wanted to throw it at him,
not at you.

28
00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:15.750 line:80%
I wanted to throw it at him!

29
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.875 line:80%
Where are you bringing me?

30
00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:24.917 line:80%
Sir! Help me, sir!
I'm a congregation member from Malaysia.

31
00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:53.958 line:80%
Sign here.

32
00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:56.000 line:80%
-Huh?
-Sign here.

33
00:04:57.167 --> 00:04:59.500 line:80%
-Why do I have to sign?
-Do you want to get out?

34
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:17.750 line:80%
-Can I leave now?
-Not yet.

35
00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.667 line:80%
-You are mine now.
-Huh?

36
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.333 line:80%
-Is there any problem?
-No.

37
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.667 line:80%
What did you say? I'm yours?

38
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:35.917 line:80%
Where did you go, Dewi?
I've been waiting for hours.

39
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.042 line:80%
Who is this?

40
00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.875 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-You too.

41
00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.042 line:80%
My name is Reyhan.

42
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.292 line:80%
Dewi was facing some problems earlier.

43
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:49.083 line:80%
Don't worry.
Dewi, don't forget our promise tomorrow.

44
00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:52.083 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-You too.

45
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.583 line:80%
You'll go to jail
if the police find out you lied.

46
00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:02.583 line:80%
I know.

47
00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:04.958 line:80%
That's for sure.

48
00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:06.833 line:80%
And they do know.

49
00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:08.042 line:80%
Huh?

50
00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:09.250 line:80%
They already know?

51
00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:13.292 line:80%
He's an Indonesian working as
the head of welfare here.

52
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.417 line:80%
He told the officer that I was a volunteer
who got lost in Medina.

53
00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:20.875 line:80%
He helped me.

54
00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:25.125 line:80%
Tomorrow, I have to give food to the poor.

55
00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:45.500 line:80%
Only days before,
their lives were just like ours

56
00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:47.875 line:80%
in Malaysia and Indonesia.

57
00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:53.833 line:80%
We were all like family,
happy together at school with friends.

58
00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.542 line:80%
All of a sudden,
everything disappeared just like that.

59
00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:02.042 line:80%
I'm sure…

60
00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:05.833 line:80%
that is what happened to you too.

61
00:07:05.917 --> 00:07:07.958 line:80%
God has a great plan for you.

62
00:07:20.042 --> 00:07:22.875 line:80%
-God is great!
-God is great!

63
00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:28.875 line:80%
-Takbir!
-God is great!

64
00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:49.167 line:80%
Jump, frog, jump

65
00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:51.333 line:80%
You're not sleeping?

66
00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:56.667 line:80%
I'm not sleepy.

67
00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:10.000 line:80%
How long are you planning to do
volunteer work like this?

68
00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.667 line:80%
I mean, you always help those in need.

69
00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:16.667 line:80%
But what about yourself?

70
00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.750 line:80%
Sorry, I don't understand.

71
00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:19.958 line:80%
You know.

72
00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:23.417 line:80%
Your future. Your goals.

73
00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:26.042 line:80%
My future?

74
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:33.333 line:80%
-I trust in God's plan.
-If you don't work for it, it won't work.

75
00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:35.042 line:80%
That's true.

76
00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.208 line:80%
I agree with you.

77
00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:39.000 line:80%
That's why I'm like this.

78
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.750 line:80%
I'm sure I'll return to God's path.

79
00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:47.542 line:80%
Why are you quiet? Any other questions?

80
00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:53.417 line:80%
I know what's in your heart.

81
00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.083 line:80%
You want to know
if I have a family, right?

82
00:08:57.833 --> 00:08:59.458 line:80%
I know what your answer is.

83
00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.667 line:80%
Marriage and fate are in God's hands.

84
00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:10.667 line:80%
What about you? Do you have it?

85
00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:12.167 line:80%
A family?

86
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.750 line:80%
Not yet.

87
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.625 line:80%
Not yet? Not even a boyfriend?

88
00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:31.917 line:80%
What?

89
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.333 line:80%
Enough!

90
00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:41.708 line:80%
Stay calm.

91
00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:01.917 line:80%
Don't push me!

92
00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.375 line:80%
Who are these people?

93
00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:06.958 line:80%
Insurgents. Stay calm and just listen.

94
00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:09.583 line:80%
We free the people. We hold them hostage!

95
00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:13.083 line:80%
Sir! I'm not with them, sir.

96
00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:15.500 line:80%
I'm from Malaysia. Here's my passport.

97
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:18.083 line:80%
I'm from Malaysia.
I'm a congregation member.

98
00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:27.708 line:80%
No!

99
00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.333 line:80%
God is great.

100
00:10:34.417 --> 00:10:36.833 line:80%
I bear witnessthat there's no God but Allah.

101
00:10:36.917 --> 00:10:39.583 line:80%
I bear witness that Muhammadis the messenger of God.

102
00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:42.167 line:80%
GOD, PLEASE PROTECT TERENGGANU

103
00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:46.250 line:80%
PENARIK NEW VILLAGE

104
00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:07.250 line:80%
It's been a while. You didn't call me
after returning from Mecca.

105
00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.583 line:80%
I came earlier. Grandma wasn't home.

106
00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:11.667 line:80%
Where did she go?

107
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.583 line:80%
She went to KT. She'll be home in a bit.

108
00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:17.292 line:80%
Dewi, you're still mad at me.

109
00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.167 line:80%
Who's mad?

110
00:11:21.542 --> 00:11:24.750 line:80%
You just need to accept the fact
that we can't be together.

111
00:11:26.542 --> 00:11:28.000 line:80%
So, we're breaking up?

112
00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.375 line:80%
You want me to forget our love story
that we've had since school?

113
00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.458 line:80%
Just like that?

114
00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:36.917 line:80%
Who ended it?

115
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.167 line:80%
Who forced me to forget about you?

116
00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:44.958 line:80%
Dewi is not wrong! I'm wrong!

117
00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:46.083 line:80%
You're not!

118
00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:49.208 line:80%
If she's that nice,
why would she follow you?

119
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.333 line:80%
I love her! I want to marry her.

120
00:11:51.708 --> 00:11:53.750 line:80%
You want to marry her? Are you crazy?

121
00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:57.875 line:80%
Dad is dying at IJN.
He could go at any moment.

122
00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.083 line:80%
Dad wants you to marry
someone else of his choice.

123
00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.333 line:80%
Two months ago, I got the news
that your dad had passed away.

124
00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:08.583 line:80%
That's why I'm here.
I want you to come back.

125
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.708 line:80%
How can you ignore
your late father's wish?

126
00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:13.917 line:80%
Dewi, he's gone already.

127
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.333 line:80%
Let me make my own life choices.

128
00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:18.792 line:80%
And the rest of your family? Your sister?

129
00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:22.833 line:80%
They have to accept the fact that
I won't marry anyone but you.

130
00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:27.333 line:80%
What if your mom falls sick
and forces you to marry someone else?

131
00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:30.500 line:80%
-That won't happen.
-If it does?

132
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.833 line:80%
-Don't think about it!
-Think about it now and answer.

133
00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:36.917 line:80%
Dewi,

134
00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:39.875 line:80%
I'll always love you no matter what.

135
00:12:41.083 --> 00:12:42.083 line:80%
Yeah, right.

136
00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:47.042 line:80%
Dewi, no other guys can love,
care for, and understand you.

137
00:12:48.292 --> 00:12:50.042 line:80%
I know you liked to eat chicken.

138
00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:54.125 line:80%
Until the doctor told you to stop.

139
00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:57.875 line:80%
You got itchy skin and a swollen face.
You complained about it.

140
00:12:58.875 --> 00:13:01.542 line:80%
When making changes in life,
you would sing…

141
00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:04.167 line:80%
Jump, frog, jump

142
00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:08.250 line:80%
Jump as high as you can

143
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:13.667 line:80%
You can't throw me away just like that.

144
00:13:16.042 --> 00:13:18.292 line:80%
After all that we've been through…

145
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.750 line:80%
I'm willing to do anything for you.

146
00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:26.917 line:80%
Even if I have to
turn my back on my family.

147
00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:46.917 line:80%
Help yourself.

148
00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:53.167 line:80%
These are country dishes.

149
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.875 line:80%
You overdid it, Grandma.
They smell so good.

150
00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:01.042 line:80%
If you come to Terengganu,

151
00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:02.917 line:80%
you have to try
nasi dagang.

152
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.500 line:80%
Yes.

153
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:11.333 line:80%
In the name of God.

154
00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:14.917 line:80%
Bless upon whatever you have given us.
Save us from Hell.

155
00:14:16.042 --> 00:14:17.250 line:80%
Amen.

156
00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:22.417 line:80%
How many times have you been
to Terengganu?

157
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.917 line:80%
This is my first time.

158
00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:31.125 line:80%
Are you guys not eating?

159
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.042 line:80%
Aren't you hungry?

160
00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:03.042 line:80%
Are you okay?

161
00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:07.292 line:80%
I'm okay.

162
00:15:14.792 --> 00:15:15.958 line:80%
Dewi, I'm sorry.

163
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.875 line:80%
You don't like me being here?

164
00:15:23.042 --> 00:15:24.750 line:80%
No. It's not like that.

165
00:15:26.583 --> 00:15:29.708 line:80%
I'm just shocked
because you wanted to come here.

166
00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:38.292 line:80%
Let me destroy his head!

167
00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:41.042 line:80%
Dad! Why do you want to protect them?

168
00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:43.083 line:80%
Our lives were stolen.

169
00:15:43.167 --> 00:15:44.750 line:80%
We must avenge them!

170
00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:50.250 line:80%
Get in!

171
00:16:06.167 --> 00:16:07.375 line:80%
Where are you going?

172
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.250 line:80%
Passport!

173
00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:22.333 line:80%
I know.

174
00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.250 line:80%
Since the first time we met…

175
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.833 line:80%
I've been thinking of
coming to Terengganu.

176
00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:38.417 line:80%
Then I promised myself,

177
00:16:39.292 --> 00:16:40.792 line:80%
that I would come here.

178
00:16:44.875 --> 00:16:46.167 line:80%
God granted it.

179
00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:48.667 line:80%
Now I'm here!

180
00:16:50.917 --> 00:16:55.208 line:80%
And I'm with a beautiful angel like you.

181
00:16:57.667 --> 00:16:59.708 line:80%
I'm Dewi, not an angel.

182
00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:01.125 line:80%
Huh?

183
00:17:01.542 --> 00:17:02.625 line:80%
What did you say?

184
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.250 line:80%
What did you say?

185
00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:09.250 line:80%
I'm not an angel.

186
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:10.917 line:80%
You know what "Dewi" means?

187
00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.833 line:80%
You know what it means?

188
00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:16.542 line:80%
No, you don't know.

189
00:17:18.708 --> 00:17:21.042 line:80%
Dewi means "the queen of all angels."

190
00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:22.125 line:80%
Now you know.

191
00:17:23.583 --> 00:17:24.583 line:80%
It's true.

192
00:17:30.375 --> 00:17:31.375 line:80%
I'm sorry.

193
00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:35.542 line:80%
I didn't mean to offend you.

194
00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.792 line:80%
I owe my life to you, Dewi.

195
00:17:56.833 --> 00:17:58.542 line:80%
You rescued me once too.

196
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.083 line:80%
Do you remember?

197
00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:09.625 line:80%
Our initial contract agreement

198
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:11.833 line:80%
the first time we met?

199
00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:16.875 line:80%
You must remember I saved you
and I told you that you're mine.

200
00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.000 line:80%
And after I rescued you,

201
00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:21.500 line:80%
our debts were settled.

202
00:18:28.792 --> 00:18:31.458 line:80%
I'm not here to claim my debt.

203
00:18:34.833 --> 00:18:35.833 line:80%
I'm here to…

204
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.458 line:80%
I'm sorry. What is it?

205
00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:45.417 line:80%
-You… I'm sorry if my words…
-Sorry?

206
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:48.083 line:80%
Ever since we met,

207
00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:51.208 line:80%
you've said "sorry" a thousand times.

208
00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:54.083 line:80%
-No. Sorry. That's not…
-See!

209
00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:55.958 line:80%
Indonesians like to say sorry.

210
00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:57.833 line:80%
"Indonesians like to say sorry"?

211
00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:02.667 line:80%
As far as I know, Malaysians like it more.

212
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.875 line:80%
-Huh?
-To the point they made songs!

213
00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:06.167 line:80%
I know a song.

214
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.875 line:80%
We're sorry

215
00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:13.042 line:80%
We're sorry

216
00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:16.875 line:80%
We're sorry

217
00:19:18.542 --> 00:19:19.625 line:80%
The whole song!

218
00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:21.375 line:80%
"We're sorry."

219
00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:27.667 line:80%
No…

220
00:19:30.583 --> 00:19:34.042 line:80%
-Dewi, I actually…
-Now I want to apologize.

221
00:19:34.542 --> 00:19:36.542 line:80%
I know what you're going to say.

222
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.417 line:80%
I'm really sorry.

223
00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:41.875 line:80%
I really can't.

224
00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:05.583 line:80%
Jump, frog, jump

225
00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:12.417 line:80%
Jump as high as you can

226
00:20:18.792 --> 00:20:22.250 line:80%
I know you have been worried all along.

227
00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:24.000 line:80%
Just share it with me.

228
00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:31.125 line:80%
Dewi.

229
00:20:40.917 --> 00:20:42.208 line:80%
I love you to death.

230
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.125 line:80%
I want to live with you forever. Really.

231
00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:51.292 line:80%
Give me a chance.

232
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:53.417 line:80%
Look at me.

233
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.583 line:80%
Please look at me.

234
00:20:55.083 --> 00:20:56.083 line:80%
Dewi…

235
00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:12.167 line:80%
You…

236
00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:16.042 line:80%
Dewi, just forget what I said earlier.

237
00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:18.667 line:80%
Just forget it.

238
00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:29.625 line:80%
Dewi.

239
00:21:30.125 --> 00:21:32.875 line:80%
I went that way
because I wanted to leave you.

240
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:37.250 line:80%
I have no other reason
but I just don't know the direction.

241
00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:47.958 line:80%
Where are you going?

242
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.125 line:80%
Back to Indonesia.

243
00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:53.542 line:80%
Thank you, Terengganu!

244
00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:23.208 line:80%
Dewi!

245
00:22:29.375 --> 00:22:30.375 line:80%
Dewi!

246
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:34.667 line:80%
There are no sharks here, right?

247
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.542 line:80%
Huh?

248
00:22:36.625 --> 00:22:38.167 line:80%
Sharks!

249
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.458 line:80%
Are you nuts?

250
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:51.458 line:80%
Dewi.

251
00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:54.375 line:80%
I swear, for God's sake.

252
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:57.125 line:80%
In my entire life,

253
00:22:57.917 --> 00:23:01.292 line:80%
this is the first time
I've confessed my love to a girl.

254
00:23:01.875 --> 00:23:02.875 line:80%
Why me?

255
00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:07.250 line:80%
There are better girls out there.

256
00:23:07.333 --> 00:23:08.333 line:80%
I want you.

257
00:23:09.292 --> 00:23:12.083 line:80%
Thousands of guys would die to have you.

258
00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:14.250 line:80%
-We're not the same.
-Why should we be?

259
00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:15.958 line:80%
I mean, should I…

260
00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:21.000 line:80%
find someone of the same gender?

261
00:23:21.375 --> 00:23:22.917 line:80%
Don't fool around.

262
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.542 line:80%
What?

263
00:23:27.208 --> 00:23:28.833 line:80%
I don't want you to have regrets.

264
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.500 line:80%
Dewi.

265
00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:34.875 line:80%
We should regret only if we sin.

266
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:40.375 line:80%
If we follow our hearts,
what is there to regret?

267
00:23:43.833 --> 00:23:44.833 line:80%
I swear to God.

268
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.875 line:80%
I'll be a good leader for you.

269
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.500 line:80%
I swear to God!

270
00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:56.875 line:80%
I need an answer right now.

271
00:23:57.792 --> 00:23:59.208 line:80%
Why do you have to rush?

272
00:24:01.042 --> 00:24:04.083 line:80%
The sea water is cold. I'm freezing.

273
00:24:05.708 --> 00:24:07.833 line:80%
I can freeze to death. Seriously.

274
00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:09.625 line:80%
You're cold, right?

275
00:24:09.708 --> 00:24:10.708 line:80%
Really cold?

276
00:24:11.792 --> 00:24:13.000 line:80%
Serves you right!

277
00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:16.000 line:80%
Why were you so clever
as to dive in at this time?

278
00:24:16.083 --> 00:24:19.917 line:80%
Not only are there sharks,
but piranhas are also in there.

279
00:24:33.292 --> 00:24:35.958 line:80%
What do you mean?
You promised to come back.

280
00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:39.500 line:80%
-I can't.
-We love each other. What's wrong?

281
00:24:39.583 --> 00:24:42.583 line:80%
I want to hear it now.
Tell me that you love me!

282
00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:45.083 line:80%
-I do love you.
-See! It's easy, right?

283
00:24:45.167 --> 00:24:47.125 line:80%
-What's so hard?
-I can't, Adam.

284
00:24:47.208 --> 00:24:49.708 line:80%
Why? You love me. So, why can't you?

285
00:24:51.667 --> 00:24:53.833 line:80%
Dewi, I'm sorry.

286
00:24:54.417 --> 00:24:56.125 line:80%
I'm sorry, Dewi!

287
00:24:56.208 --> 00:24:58.208 line:80%
Fine, if that's what you want.

288
00:24:59.292 --> 00:25:00.292 line:80%
I'll leave.

289
00:25:03.167 --> 00:25:05.583 line:80%
But please tell me.

290
00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:07.875 line:80%
Why did you change your mind?

291
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.042 line:80%
I won't get mad. You can tell me.

292
00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:21.417 line:80%
I'm seeing someone.

293
00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:24.833 line:80%
I knew it!

294
00:25:28.542 --> 00:25:29.542 line:80%
Who?

295
00:25:32.542 --> 00:25:33.542 line:80%
He's from Indonesia.

296
00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:37.750 line:80%
Indonesia? Where did you meet him?

297
00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:40.458 line:80%
Medina.

298
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.542 line:80%
Dewi, people go there for pilgrimage,
but you went to find some guy!

299
00:25:48.542 --> 00:25:52.083 line:80%
-He's a nice guy, Adam.
-You mean he's better than me?

300
00:25:53.917 --> 00:25:55.292 line:80%
Dewi, listen carefully.

301
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:57.833 line:80%
I'm from a respected family.

302
00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:02.875 line:80%
They want to match me
with a girl of the same status,

303
00:26:02.958 --> 00:26:04.833 line:80%
but I refused it because of you.

304
00:26:05.583 --> 00:26:06.875 line:80%
All for you!

305
00:26:12.333 --> 00:26:13.333 line:80%
Now,

306
00:26:13.833 --> 00:26:14.833 line:80%
please tell me.

307
00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:20.875 line:80%
What does that guy have that I don't?

308
00:26:26.792 --> 00:26:30.708 line:80%
Dewi, I don't blame you.

309
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.458 line:80%
I blame that guy.

310
00:26:36.125 --> 00:26:39.042 line:80%
He took advantage of you
when your mind was a mess.

311
00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:46.417 line:80%
Dewi.

312
00:26:48.958 --> 00:26:50.250 line:80%
I'm here now.

313
00:26:52.083 --> 00:26:53.083 line:80%
Okay?

314
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.958 line:80%
So, you don't have to worry.

315
00:26:56.042 --> 00:26:58.708 line:80%
You don't have to worry about this. Okay?

316
00:27:00.958 --> 00:27:02.875 line:80%
Let's get married.

317
00:27:02.958 --> 00:27:05.917 line:80%
Let's get married in Golok.

318
00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:08.708 line:80%
Let's go there and get married.

319
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.458 line:80%
LONG LIVE THE KING
WELCOME TO TERENGGANU

320
00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:21.375 line:80%
Dewi.

321
00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:28.958 line:80%
What sound is that?

322
00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:31.833 line:80%
Bombs. It's been three times.

323
00:28:32.458 --> 00:28:34.167 line:80%
So, do you want to go across?

324
00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:05.458 line:80%
Go ahead.

325
00:29:05.542 --> 00:29:08.125 line:80%
-Why are you late?
-This is considered fast.

326
00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:09.583 line:80%
Go.

327
00:29:13.458 --> 00:29:14.458 line:80%
Go.

328
00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:17.375 line:80%
As you please.

329
00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:18.833 line:80%
Sit here.

330
00:29:29.042 --> 00:29:31.042 line:80%
How's the payment?

331
00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:33.500 line:80%
They're asking for payment.

332
00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:34.583 line:80%
How much?

333
00:29:35.542 --> 00:29:36.542 line:80%
How much?

334
00:29:36.833 --> 00:29:37.917 line:80%
The price is 3,000 ringgit.

335
00:29:38.708 --> 00:29:40.042 line:80%
He's asking for 3,000.

336
00:29:40.125 --> 00:29:41.292 line:80%
Why so expensive?

337
00:29:41.375 --> 00:29:43.458 line:80%
That's normal. They came from Golok.

338
00:29:43.542 --> 00:29:46.500 line:80%
He always helps Kelantan people
get married at that price.

339
00:29:46.583 --> 00:29:50.417 line:80%
But 3,000 is too expensive.
It's just 500 in Golok.

340
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.917 line:80%
That's the price.
You can go to Golok and see for yourself.

341
00:30:09.333 --> 00:30:10.375 line:80%
Identity card?

342
00:30:10.958 --> 00:30:12.167 line:80%
He's asking for your IC.

343
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:18.250 line:80%
Can you give me your IC?

344
00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:20.417 line:80%
He wants your future wife's card.

345
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.750 line:80%
Identity card?

346
00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:25.042 line:80%
I didn't bring my purse.

347
00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:28.250 line:80%
-The woman's identification card?
-Yes.

348
00:30:28.333 --> 00:30:29.542 line:80%
She doesn't have it.

349
00:30:30.583 --> 00:30:31.792 line:80%
I can't do it then.

350
00:30:31.875 --> 00:30:36.417 line:80%
He can't do it. He needs her identity card
for you to get married.

351
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.667 line:80%
What's so hard?

352
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.625 line:80%
An IC isn't compulsory to get married.

353
00:30:42.083 --> 00:30:44.625 line:80%
Who does Reyhan want to get married to?

354
00:30:44.708 --> 00:30:48.667 line:80%
He called me yesterday.
I just found out too.

355
00:30:49.875 --> 00:30:53.708 line:80%
But, it seems like he got
a girl from Malaysia.

356
00:30:55.292 --> 00:30:58.250 line:80%
Seriously? Thank God.

357
00:30:58.917 --> 00:31:00.750 line:80%
Reyhan finally…

358
00:31:01.167 --> 00:31:05.875 line:80%
He has always been shy with girls.

359
00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:10.417 line:80%
Now he's coming back home,
wanting to get married.

360
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.375 line:80%
Praise be to God.

361
00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:15.208 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-And unto you peace.

362
00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:17.458 line:80%
Aliyah.

363
00:31:18.167 --> 00:31:23.917 line:80%
I cooked some veggies.
I'm here to give this to you.

364
00:31:24.792 --> 00:31:27.583 line:80%
I also bought these meds for you.

365
00:31:27.667 --> 00:31:28.792 line:80%
Wow!

366
00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:31.042 line:80%
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

367
00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:33.625 line:80%
Your meds are running out, right?

368
00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:35.000 line:80%
That's true.

369
00:31:35.083 --> 00:31:38.292 line:80%
-You didn't have to trouble yourself.
-Not at all.

370
00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:40.667 line:80%
I'm glad to help.

371
00:31:43.458 --> 00:31:44.792 line:80%
Oh, I wanted to ask.

372
00:31:45.958 --> 00:31:49.583 line:80%
I heard something earlier.
Is Reyhan coming back soon?

373
00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:00.875 line:80%
Adam?

374
00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:04.750 line:80%
He just came back.
I don't know where he went yesterday.

375
00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:08.875 line:80%
Okay, Mom. Let Adam take care of
everything in Dad's office.

376
00:32:08.958 --> 00:32:11.917 line:80%
You don't have to worry about it.
Just enjoy yourself, okay?

377
00:32:12.458 --> 00:32:14.333 line:80%
You still want to talk to him? Wait.

378
00:32:20.542 --> 00:32:22.000 line:80%
I'll call you back.

379
00:32:23.125 --> 00:32:24.125 line:80%
Bye.

380
00:32:25.542 --> 00:32:27.083 line:80%
What's all this?

381
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.250 line:80%
-This is…
-No need. I know who she is.

382
00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:38.375 line:80%
What's she doing in my house?

383
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.583 line:80%
-Married in Golok?
-Pengkalan Kubor.

384
00:33:02.042 --> 00:33:03.042 line:80%
Golok isn't safe.

385
00:33:03.708 --> 00:33:06.917 line:80%
A marriage official from Golok came
to Pengkalan Kubor.

386
00:33:11.958 --> 00:33:12.958 line:80%
It's okay.

387
00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:15.250 line:80%
I have ten more copies.

388
00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.125 line:80%
Are you okay?

389
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.500 line:80%
Can we talk?

390
00:33:53.958 --> 00:33:55.375 line:80%
I'm going to be frank.

391
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.042 line:80%
I'm really mad about what you have done.

392
00:33:59.417 --> 00:34:02.292 line:80%
-I don't want…
-Listen.

393
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:07.458 line:80%
I have to accept that you and Dewi,
are now legally husband and wife.

394
00:34:10.125 --> 00:34:13.750 line:80%
No matter how wrong
and dumb it was for you to do this,

395
00:34:15.125 --> 00:34:16.208 line:80%
I have to accept it.

396
00:34:18.542 --> 00:34:19.542 line:80%
Dewi.

397
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.417 line:80%
This is your home too now.

398
00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:32.708 line:80%
One more thing.

399
00:34:33.458 --> 00:34:35.083 line:80%
Have dinner tonight with me.

400
00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:40.000 line:80%
I want to celebrate my new sister-in-law.

401
00:34:42.375 --> 00:34:43.708 line:80%
Do your own thing.

402
00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.458 line:80%
Hello. Yes, where are you now?

403
00:35:14.542 --> 00:35:16.875 line:80%
Okay.

404
00:35:17.417 --> 00:35:18.417 line:80%
Okay, bye.

405
00:35:19.625 --> 00:35:20.750 line:80%
Is Adam joining us?

406
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.667 line:80%
No.

407
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:27.375 line:80%
He had to fly to KL for one day or two
for some business.

408
00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.833 line:80%
-Peace be upon you, Ms. Tasya.
-And unto you too.

409
00:35:30.167 --> 00:35:31.833 line:80%
-Please sit down, sir.
-Thank you.

410
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.042 line:80%
Is she the girl you told me about?

411
00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:39.375 line:80%
What's all this?

412
00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:43.208 line:80%
-Who are you?
-Dewi, mind your manners.

413
00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:45.958 line:80%
This is Sir Nasran,

414
00:35:46.042 --> 00:35:48.708 line:80%
from the Syarie Prosecution Division.

415
00:35:48.792 --> 00:35:51.958 line:80%
-Do you want to drink?
-It's okay. I'm in a rush.

416
00:35:52.042 --> 00:35:53.333 line:80%
-Tasya?
-Relax.

417
00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:58.542 line:80%
There are a few things
that can raise doubts.

418
00:35:58.625 --> 00:36:01.125 line:80%
Our marriage followed
the rules and conditions.

419
00:36:01.208 --> 00:36:04.292 line:80%
The problem is,
the marriage official isn't accredited.

420
00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:06.625 line:80%
Our marriage official is accredited.

421
00:36:06.708 --> 00:36:09.500 line:80%
He's accredited in Southern Thailand.

422
00:36:09.583 --> 00:36:12.083 line:80%
He has no credentials here in Kelantan.

423
00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:26.208 line:80%
Those are just the laws.

424
00:36:26.875 --> 00:36:28.792 line:80%
It's valid in Islam.

425
00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:31.875 line:80%
Don't just do whateverfeels good, Ms. Dewi.

426
00:36:31.958 --> 00:36:36.042 line:80%
I was told that your mom passed awayand your dad is still alive.

427
00:36:37.542 --> 00:36:40.792 line:80%
Your dad still holdshis right as your guardian

428
00:36:41.292 --> 00:36:46.583 line:80%
unless he entrusted the marriage officialas a guardian judge.

429
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000 line:80%
You can go to any Syariah court.

430
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.167 line:80%
The judge will decide…

431
00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:00.792 line:80%
that your marriage is annulled

432
00:37:01.792 --> 00:37:02.792 line:80%
and invalid.

433
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.375 line:80%
Where did you go?

434
00:37:37.458 --> 00:37:41.667 line:80%
You didn't come back home for two days.
Where did you sleep yesterday?

435
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.917 line:80%
I slept at my friend's house, Grandma.
What's going on?

436
00:37:45.917 --> 00:37:48.792 line:80%
This is Dewi, my granddaughter.

437
00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:51.333 line:80%
-Ask her yourself, okay?
-Ask what?

438
00:37:52.125 --> 00:37:53.875 line:80%
They came to inquire.

439
00:37:53.958 --> 00:37:55.583 line:80%
Hi, Dewi. How are you?

440
00:37:57.042 --> 00:37:59.417 line:80%
-I'm good.
-Has anyone come to propose?

441
00:38:00.042 --> 00:38:01.042 line:80%
Not yet.

442
00:38:04.375 --> 00:38:05.750 line:80%
If not,

443
00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:09.542 line:80%
we're very happy to convey
our friend's wish to propose to you, Dewi.

444
00:38:09.625 --> 00:38:12.042 line:80%
I don't think there is any problem.

445
00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:13.292 line:80%
Grandma…

446
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:16.875 line:80%
Even you don't know who they are.

447
00:38:17.792 --> 00:38:20.542 line:80%
How come you didn't know?
I'm sure you know him.

448
00:38:20.625 --> 00:38:21.625 line:80%
His name is Reyhan.

449
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.333 line:80%
Peace be upon you.

450
00:38:51.083 --> 00:38:52.417 line:80%
And unto you too.

451
00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:54.917 line:80%
What is this tent for?

452
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.417 line:80%
It's for special guests.

453
00:38:58.333 --> 00:38:59.792 line:80%
-Who?
-You know…

454
00:39:00.583 --> 00:39:03.667 line:80%
I got permission
from the authority to hold an event here.

455
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.167 line:80%
What event? Why didn't you tell me?

456
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.042 line:80%
Why do you like to plan such surprises?

457
00:39:11.833 --> 00:39:13.542 line:80%
I thought you would like it.

458
00:39:14.167 --> 00:39:16.875 line:80%
What? I don't like it.
I've never liked it.

459
00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:20.417 line:80%
-You can't do this.
-Calm down.

460
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000 line:80%
Trust me.

461
00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:23.583 line:80%
Okay?

462
00:39:25.708 --> 00:39:27.333 line:80%
Be patient. You'll like it.

463
00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:32.167 line:80%
Look to your right. Now.

464
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:38.750 line:80%
They are Arab children.

465
00:39:39.958 --> 00:39:42.125 line:80%
They're staying here for three days.

466
00:39:42.208 --> 00:39:43.375 line:80%
Let's go.

467
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.750 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-Unto you too.

468
00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:48.500 line:80%
-How are you?
-Good, praise be to God.

469
00:39:48.583 --> 00:39:49.625 line:80%
This is Dewi.

470
00:40:16.708 --> 00:40:19.375 line:80%
WELCOME TO
CRYSTAL MOSQUE

471
00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:23.917 line:80%
These are donations for the victims
from Pondok Daurah Fateh Annur.

472
00:40:24.667 --> 00:40:25.833 line:80%
Thank you, Mr. Haji.

473
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:33.500 line:80%
It's Asr. What if you lead the Asr prayer?

474
00:40:34.958 --> 00:40:35.958 line:80%
If God wills.

475
00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:43.500 line:80%
Thank God. I hope God eases their lives
and gives more to them.

476
00:40:44.167 --> 00:40:46.583 line:80%
If God wills. This is all because of you.

477
00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:50.042 line:80%
I just told the mosque congregation.

478
00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:54.000 line:80%
You know what you should do?

479
00:40:54.417 --> 00:40:57.208 line:80%
Ask them to pray
so our marriage can be sooner.

480
00:41:01.417 --> 00:41:03.167 line:80%
Dewi…

481
00:41:03.958 --> 00:41:05.000 line:80%
I love you.

482
00:41:06.083 --> 00:41:07.125 line:80%
Dewi?

483
00:41:08.375 --> 00:41:09.667 line:80%
I love you!

484
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.208 line:80%
Let's pray together.

485
00:41:16.292 --> 00:41:18.625 line:80%
I'll take my prayer veil
from the car first, okay?

486
00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:36.417 line:80%
Dewi!

487
00:41:38.875 --> 00:41:40.250 line:80%
What are you doing here?

488
00:41:40.792 --> 00:41:41.792 line:80%
To see my wife.

489
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.625 line:80%
Why didn't you tell me you went back?

490
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.500 line:80%
Didn't Tasya tell you?

491
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.500 line:80%
Tell me what?

492
00:41:51.958 --> 00:41:54.750 line:80%
-I'm going for ablution.
-I want to pray too.

493
00:41:57.958 --> 00:41:59.458 line:80%
Stay close to each other.

494
00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:15.958 line:80%
God is great.

495
00:42:16.042 --> 00:42:18.417 line:80%
-God is great.
-God is great.

496
00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:33.292 line:80%
Where are you going?

497
00:42:33.375 --> 00:42:34.875 line:80%
Grandma told me to go home soon.

498
00:42:35.375 --> 00:42:37.792 line:80%
You don't have to. Let's go eat.

499
00:42:38.542 --> 00:42:41.542 line:80%
Don't do this. I want to eat with Grandma.

500
00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:44.375 line:80%
-She has cooked.
-Even better, I can eat at your place.

501
00:42:44.875 --> 00:42:45.958 line:80%
I want to meet her

502
00:42:47.167 --> 00:42:48.417 line:80%
and inform her about us.

503
00:42:50.542 --> 00:42:52.042 line:80%
Our marriage was invalid.

504
00:42:54.083 --> 00:42:56.542 line:80%
What did you say? Who said it was invalid?

505
00:42:57.917 --> 00:43:00.458 line:80%
-Ask your sister.
-Why do I have to ask her?

506
00:43:00.542 --> 00:43:04.500 line:80%
What do you not understand?
We can't be together.

507
00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:05.708 line:80%
What's this nonsense?

508
00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:09.583 line:80%
Dewi, we're married.

509
00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.917 line:80%
You still don't understand.
Our marriage wasn't invalid!

510
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.792 line:80%
You're just making excuses, right?

511
00:43:17.875 --> 00:43:20.042 line:80%
Because of the guy
who led the prayer earlier.

512
00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:25.750 line:80%
Peace be upon you.

513
00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:29.125 line:80%
-What's going on?
-And unto you too.

514
00:43:29.208 --> 00:43:30.625 line:80%
Ustaz, how are you?

515
00:43:31.708 --> 00:43:32.833 line:80%
I'm Reyhan.

516
00:43:33.417 --> 00:43:34.417 line:80%
I'm not an Ustaz.

517
00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:36.208 line:80%
Dewi, are you okay?

518
00:43:36.917 --> 00:43:39.208 line:80%
-Yes.
-She's okay.

519
00:43:39.667 --> 00:43:41.208 line:80%
You don't have to worry.

520
00:43:43.375 --> 00:43:45.917 line:80%
I have a right to ask anything
to my fiancée.

521
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:49.500 line:80%
-Let's go, Dewi.
-Fiancée?

522
00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:52.917 line:80%
When was the engagement?

523
00:43:55.167 --> 00:43:58.875 line:80%
-That's not your business.
-Two days? Three days? 30 years?

524
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:02.000 line:80%
What is this?

525
00:44:02.833 --> 00:44:06.042 line:80%
You should go back to the beach first.
Go to the beach.

526
00:44:06.125 --> 00:44:08.750 line:80%
-Come with me.
-Let me settle this with Adam.

527
00:44:09.958 --> 00:44:11.083 line:80%
Go first.

528
00:44:12.417 --> 00:44:14.375 line:80%
Can you go, please?

529
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.250 line:80%
What did you say?

530
00:44:21.083 --> 00:44:22.083 line:80%
"Adam"?

531
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.125 line:80%
Sorry, I just realized.

532
00:44:41.208 --> 00:44:42.625 line:80%
I just realized.

533
00:44:43.208 --> 00:44:46.542 line:80%
I wasn't sure of the situation just now,

534
00:44:47.542 --> 00:44:49.292 line:80%
but now I understand.

535
00:44:49.833 --> 00:44:50.833 line:80%
You're Adam?

536
00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:55.667 line:80%
I know your intention.

537
00:44:58.333 --> 00:45:00.250 line:80%
You won't get what you came for!

538
00:45:00.333 --> 00:45:02.542 line:80%
-You don't know who I am!
-Adam!

539
00:45:02.625 --> 00:45:06.583 line:80%
-Don't make a scene. Let's go!
-Do you have anything to say?

540
00:45:07.042 --> 00:45:10.167 line:80%
-Reyhan! Adam, what is this?
-Don't be so arrogant!

541
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:14.208 line:80%
You came here and messed with my family!
You don't know who I am!

542
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.333 line:80%
-Go!
-Dewi, calm down.

543
00:45:17.417 --> 00:45:19.917 line:80%
-Leave now.
-Don't worry. Really.

544
00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:23.125 line:80%
Leave. Leave now!

545
00:45:31.083 --> 00:45:32.083 line:80%
Let's go!

546
00:46:12.958 --> 00:46:14.292 line:80%
I'm sorry, Adam.

547
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000 line:80%
Hey!

548
00:46:27.625 --> 00:46:29.000 line:80%
Can you give me a ride home?

549
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.375 line:80%
Dewi, you can't do this to me.

550
00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:35.083 line:80%
I won't give up, Dewi!

551
00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:37.500 line:80%
Jump, frog, jump

552
00:46:37.583 --> 00:46:40.042 line:80%
Jump as high as you can

553
00:46:40.125 --> 00:46:42.667 line:80%
Dewi!

554
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:17.750 line:80%
Are you okay?

555
00:47:28.042 --> 00:47:30.458 line:80%
I'll go. I understand.

556
00:47:44.208 --> 00:47:45.375 line:80%
I'm ready.

557
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.125 line:80%
Reyhan.

558
00:48:27.958 --> 00:48:30.208 line:80%
-I'm good, Dad.
-Amen!

559
00:48:32.083 --> 00:48:34.042 line:80%
-Uncle.
-Yes.

560
00:48:34.125 --> 00:48:35.500 line:80%
I'm Dewi.

561
00:48:36.292 --> 00:48:38.708 line:80%
Don't call us Aunty or Uncle.

562
00:48:38.792 --> 00:48:40.167 line:80%
Just call me Mom.

563
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.333 line:80%
Dad.

564
00:48:44.375 --> 00:48:46.000 line:80%
I marry you

565
00:48:46.083 --> 00:48:49.000 line:80%
to Dewi Ashikin binti Darun
with the guardian judge

566
00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:51.167 line:80%
and the dowry mentioned paid in cash.

567
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.542 line:80%
I accept this marriage to

568
00:48:53.625 --> 00:48:57.333 line:80%
Dewi Ashikin binti Darun
with the dowry mentioned paid in cash.

569
00:48:57.417 --> 00:48:58.458 line:80%
How is it, witnesses?

570
00:48:58.542 --> 00:49:00.792 line:80%
-Valid.
-Praise be to God.

571
00:49:15.167 --> 00:49:17.125 line:80%
We're still not sure.

572
00:49:17.625 --> 00:49:20.000 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-And unto you too.

573
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.917 line:80%
-You look tired.
-Peace be upon you.

574
00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:31.292 line:80%
Congratulations, Reyhan.
May you both be a loving family.

575
00:49:34.125 --> 00:49:35.125 line:80%
Peace be unto you too.

576
00:49:37.167 --> 00:49:38.208 line:80%
Aliyah?

577
00:49:39.583 --> 00:49:41.083 line:80%
You were here all along?

578
00:49:47.375 --> 00:49:50.000 line:80%
-This is Dewi.
-Aliyah.

579
00:49:52.167 --> 00:49:53.292 line:80%
She's pretty.

580
00:49:53.375 --> 00:49:55.333 line:80%
She's definitely a match for you.

581
00:49:56.958 --> 00:49:57.958 line:80%
How are you?

582
00:49:58.625 --> 00:50:00.125 line:80%
I'm good, thank God.

583
00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:01.625 line:80%
Praise be to God.

584
00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:06.083 line:80%
I'm now engaged too.

585
00:50:11.042 --> 00:50:12.333 line:80%
You're engaged to my brother?

586
00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:19.542 line:80%
I invited Aliyah to come.

587
00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:22.042 line:80%
When your dad was sick,

588
00:50:22.708 --> 00:50:24.625 line:80%
Aliyah would always come to our house

589
00:50:24.708 --> 00:50:26.708 line:80%
to visit and help me take care of him.

590
00:50:26.792 --> 00:50:29.000 line:80%
Aliyah is very hardworking.

591
00:50:30.208 --> 00:50:31.875 line:80%
Even though you're not always here,

592
00:50:32.792 --> 00:50:35.958 line:80%
I still feel as if I have a child at home.

593
00:50:37.417 --> 00:50:38.417 line:80%
Thank God.

594
00:50:39.542 --> 00:50:40.542 line:80%
Thank you.

595
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.917 line:80%
What are you thinking?

596
00:51:19.292 --> 00:51:20.500 line:80%
A lot of things.

597
00:51:30.833 --> 00:51:32.792 line:80%
You don't have to think anymore.

598
00:51:32.875 --> 00:51:34.542 line:80%
Trust me.

599
00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:36.042 line:80%
We'll go through it together.

600
00:52:01.958 --> 00:52:05.958 line:80%
"I seek refuge with God
from the outcast Satan.

601
00:52:06.042 --> 00:52:07.833 line:80%
In the name of God.

602
00:52:09.083 --> 00:52:11.292 line:80%
Have We not opened your breast for you?

603
00:52:11.375 --> 00:52:16.750 line:80%
And removed from you your burden
which weighed down your back?

604
00:52:17.833 --> 00:52:20.292 line:80%
And raised high your fame?

605
00:52:20.375 --> 00:52:22.458 line:80%
Verily, with the hardship,
there is relief.

606
00:52:22.542 --> 00:52:25.125 line:80%
With the hardship, there is relief."

607
00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:45.958 line:80%
-Yes! Must be until eternity.
-I will let her know.

608
00:52:47.542 --> 00:52:50.250 line:80%
If the reunion is done, please come in.

609
00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:53.000 line:80%
There are still a lot of reports pending.

610
00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.542 line:80%
-Take care.
-Let's have coffee soon!

611
00:52:57.375 --> 00:53:00.958 line:80%
Han, where's your report?
You didn't send it after getting married.

612
00:53:01.042 --> 00:53:02.042 line:80%
Yes, I'm getting it.

613
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.333 line:80%
Reyhan, how's Dewi?

614
00:53:05.917 --> 00:53:08.500 line:80%
Everything is all good.

615
00:53:08.583 --> 00:53:10.125 line:80%
Praise be to God.

616
00:53:10.208 --> 00:53:13.000 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-And unto you too.

617
00:53:13.542 --> 00:53:14.542 line:80%
Aliyah?

618
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:31.042 line:80%
The best way to make
your husband stay at home

619
00:53:31.833 --> 00:53:33.917 line:80%
is by taking care of his appetite.

620
00:53:36.292 --> 00:53:37.708 line:80%
Did you know?

621
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:44.208 line:80%
When Reyhan called,
he always talked about Terengganu.

622
00:53:44.292 --> 00:53:46.833 line:80%
How Terengganu is a beautiful state.

623
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:50.208 line:80%
Mom, Bandung is beautiful too!

624
00:53:50.833 --> 00:53:53.708 line:80%
I like it here. It's more calming.

625
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.500 line:80%
I think it's cooked. Try and taste it.

626
00:53:59.583 --> 00:54:00.708 line:80%
In the name of God.

627
00:54:02.583 --> 00:54:03.917 line:80%
Are the spices enough?

628
00:54:05.042 --> 00:54:06.042 line:80%
Yes…

629
00:54:10.292 --> 00:54:11.667 line:80%
I'm not sick.

630
00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:13.458 line:80%
My question was…

631
00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:17.208 line:80%
Your husband did this?
I didn't ask whether it hurts or not.

632
00:54:22.042 --> 00:54:24.125 line:80%
Have you realized all this while?

633
00:54:25.708 --> 00:54:27.958 line:80%
You've never shared
any of your problems with me.

634
00:54:32.208 --> 00:54:35.667 line:80%
I came to Muslim Care
just to ask for legal advice.

635
00:54:36.167 --> 00:54:39.625 line:80%
It's not just that.
Now the problem is different.

636
00:54:48.042 --> 00:54:50.042 line:80%
Why did you marry such a guy?

637
00:54:50.125 --> 00:54:51.792 line:80%
Maybe because of love.

638
00:54:51.875 --> 00:54:53.833 line:80%
Love is not something that is hurtful.

639
00:54:53.917 --> 00:54:55.708 line:80%
Why do you care about me now?

640
00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:57.167 line:80%
Wasn't it clear enough?

641
00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:01.542 line:80%
If you cared about me,
why did you leave me?

642
00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:13.708 line:80%
Congratulations. You're pregnant.

643
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.250 line:80%
Pregnant?

644
00:55:21.542 --> 00:55:23.000 line:80%
-How long?
-Two months.

645
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.208 line:80%
From the document earlier,
you got married yesterday.

646
00:55:33.292 --> 00:55:34.333 line:80%
Where did you go last night?

647
00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:38.708 line:80%
We stayed at a hotel.

648
00:55:42.542 --> 00:55:44.292 line:80%
So, first night at a hotel?

649
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.792 line:80%
Our marriage followedthe terms and conditions.

650
00:55:51.875 --> 00:55:55.042 line:80%
The problem is,the marriage official isn't accredited.

651
00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:03.042 line:80%
He's accredited in Southern Thailand.

652
00:56:03.125 --> 00:56:06.083 line:80%
He has no credentials here in Kelantan.

653
00:56:06.167 --> 00:56:07.375 line:80%
Those are just laws.

654
00:56:08.208 --> 00:56:09.958 line:80%
It's valid in Islam.

655
00:56:12.083 --> 00:56:15.583 line:80%
I accept this marriage
to Dewi Ashikin binti Darun

656
00:56:15.667 --> 00:56:17.792 line:80%
with the dowry mentioned paid in cash.

657
00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:20.125 line:80%
-How is it, witnesses?
-Valid?

658
00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:22.333 line:80%
Thank goodness.

659
00:56:39.042 --> 00:56:40.375 line:80%
What are you doing here?

660
00:56:43.625 --> 00:56:44.708 line:80%
I have a headache.

661
00:56:45.208 --> 00:56:46.208 line:80%
What?

662
00:56:57.083 --> 00:56:58.833 line:80%
Let's go to the doctor.

663
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:01.750 line:80%
I went to the clinic.

664
00:57:02.917 --> 00:57:06.000 line:80%
-You'll get worse. Let's go.
-I'm pregnant.

665
00:57:08.417 --> 00:57:09.417 line:80%
Really?

666
00:57:35.542 --> 00:57:37.375 line:80%
A pregnant lady has to eat a lot.

667
00:57:38.333 --> 00:57:39.917 line:80%
You're eating for two now.

668
00:57:40.375 --> 00:57:41.375 line:80%
Agreed.

669
00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:44.542 line:80%
I will add another room

670
00:57:45.458 --> 00:57:47.458 line:80%
for our first grandchild.

671
00:57:47.542 --> 00:57:51.333 line:80%
The baby won't need a room.
Just sleep with us.

672
00:57:51.417 --> 00:57:52.958 line:80%
No way.

673
00:57:53.042 --> 00:57:56.375 line:80%
The baby should sleep with the parents,
not the grandparents.

674
00:57:56.458 --> 00:57:58.833 line:80%
You don't know how to handle a baby yet.

675
00:57:58.917 --> 00:58:01.125 line:80%
You can just leave the baby with us.

676
00:58:01.208 --> 00:58:02.917 line:80%
We have to learn too.

677
00:58:04.042 --> 00:58:05.042 line:80%
Right?

678
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.542 line:80%
What do you want? Do you want this one?

679
00:58:12.875 --> 00:58:14.042 line:80%
Let's eat.

680
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000 line:80%
What's wrong?

681
00:58:19.333 --> 00:58:20.625 line:80%
Excuse me.

682
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.458 line:80%
I don't have an appetite.

683
00:58:45.542 --> 00:58:46.917 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

684
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:52.250 line:80%
Nothing.

685
00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:55.333 line:80%
I just have a headache.

686
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000 line:80%
That's all?

687
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:02.458 line:80%
I don't believe you.

688
00:59:03.917 --> 00:59:06.000 line:80%
You're thinking about something else.

689
00:59:06.708 --> 00:59:07.750 line:80%
You can tell me.

690
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:24.042 line:80%
I don't like it when your parents try
to get involved in my affairs.

691
00:59:27.167 --> 00:59:29.083 line:80%
I can handle my child's affairs.

692
00:59:37.042 --> 00:59:39.583 line:80%
You'll take care of it, Dewi.

693
00:59:39.667 --> 00:59:40.792 line:80%
You're the mother.

694
00:59:43.583 --> 00:59:46.167 line:80%
Dewi, listen to me.

695
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:50.292 line:80%
They are just happy
to get a grandchild, that's all.

696
00:59:52.333 --> 00:59:53.333 line:80%
Reyhan…

697
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.000 line:80%
I beg you.

698
00:59:57.792 --> 00:59:59.375 line:80%
I want to move out.

699
01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:02.708 line:80%
I'm not comfortable here.
I want to move out.

700
01:00:03.625 --> 01:00:06.042 line:80%
Let's move out.

701
01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.042 line:80%
Stop it, Dewi.

702
01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.125 line:80%
-Calm down.
-Let's move out!

703
01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:12.208 line:80%
Calm yourself, please. Listen to me.

704
01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:14.042 line:80%
Why aren't you comfortable?

705
01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.292 line:80%
Because it's your parents' house.

706
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.708 line:80%
I know why you're reluctant.

707
01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:28.500 line:80%
You want to keep meeting
your pretty ex-girlfriend, right?

708
01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:33.542 line:80%
Behind my back. Right?
That's why you want to stay.

709
01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:37.625 line:80%
I talked to her
because she needed my help.

710
01:00:39.542 --> 01:00:40.750 line:80%
But Reyhan…

711
01:00:40.833 --> 01:00:44.458 line:80%
I'm your wife now!

712
01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:46.708 line:80%
I need your help.

713
01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:52.417 line:80%
I don't understand
what's going through your mind.

714
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.292 line:80%
But listen. I'm your husband,
and I know my responsibilities.

715
01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:19.333 line:80%
I know why you're reluctant.

716
01:01:19.417 --> 01:01:22.625 line:80%
You want to keep meetingyour pretty ex-girlfriend, right?

717
01:01:22.708 --> 01:01:26.042 line:80%
Behind my back. Right?That's why you want to stay.

718
01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:38.917 line:80%
You're not asleep yet?

719
01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.542 line:80%
No, Mom.

720
01:01:45.458 --> 01:01:46.625 line:80%
I'm not sleepy yet.

721
01:01:49.792 --> 01:01:51.000 line:80%
Don't worry…

722
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.458 line:80%
It's normal for pregnant ladies
to act that way.

723
01:02:06.167 --> 01:02:08.000 line:80%
Who's calling me late at night?

724
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:11.750 line:80%
Aliyah.

725
01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:16.708 line:80%
-Hello, Aliyah.
-What kind of wife are you?!

726
01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.500 line:80%
I work hard! What do you want?

727
01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:21.750 line:80%
I work hard for you!

728
01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:25.167 line:80%
Appreciate me as your husband!

729
01:02:26.167 --> 01:02:27.500 line:80%
Keep crying!

730
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.250 line:80%
Aliyah?

731
01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:41.125 line:80%
Mom, Aliyah?

732
01:02:42.042 --> 01:02:44.000 line:80%
She's being hit by her husband again?

733
01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:49.417 line:80%
She told me that her husband is jealous.

734
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.292 line:80%
-If you knew, why didn't you tell me?
-I wasn't sure.

735
01:02:52.375 --> 01:02:54.500 line:80%
She didn't want to lodge a police report.

736
01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:56.458 line:80%
You should have told me about this.

737
01:02:56.542 --> 01:02:58.833 line:80%
-I want to help her.
-Reyhan.

738
01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:05.208 line:80%
It's someone else's marriage.

739
01:03:47.167 --> 01:03:48.250 line:80%
Don't push me.

740
01:04:07.833 --> 01:04:09.875 line:80%
Dewi, someone came to find you.

741
01:04:10.833 --> 01:04:11.833 line:80%
Who is it, Mom?

742
01:04:12.208 --> 01:04:13.708 line:80%
He said he was your family.

743
01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:40.958 line:80%
Peace be upon you, Dewi.

744
01:04:41.875 --> 01:04:47.000 line:80%
We can't help if she doesn't lodge
an official report herself

745
01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.958 line:80%
about this domestic violence.

746
01:04:49.042 --> 01:04:51.000 line:80%
Then why did I bring her here?

747
01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:53.083 line:80%
That's why.

748
01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:54.833 line:80%
Aliyah.

749
01:04:55.542 --> 01:04:57.000 line:80%
Trust us.

750
01:04:58.083 --> 01:04:59.458 line:80%
What are you scared of?

751
01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:01.458 line:80%
We'll protect you.

752
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:08.417 line:80%
But if I report my husband,
that means I'm on the edge of a divorce.

753
01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:10.708 line:80%
Oh, God.

754
01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:13.208 line:80%
Most likely.

755
01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:17.333 line:80%
I don't want to divorce.

756
01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:24.167 line:80%
Aliyah? Aliyah!

757
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.458 line:80%
Look at me!

758
01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.208 line:80%
After last night, you can still say that?

759
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.958 line:80%
How did you find me?

760
01:05:42.583 --> 01:05:44.125 line:80%
I asked your friend

761
01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:45.875 line:80%
and Wazed my way here.

762
01:05:45.958 --> 01:05:47.042 line:80%
It wasn't hard.

763
01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:49.458 line:80%
What do you want?

764
01:05:51.708 --> 01:05:52.750 line:80%
Let's sit first.

765
01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.708 line:80%
There are many things I want to tell you.

766
01:05:56.833 --> 01:05:58.333 line:80%
There is nothing left to say.

767
01:05:58.417 --> 01:05:59.708 line:80%
Those are your words.

768
01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:03.833 line:80%
I know…

769
01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:07.042 line:80%
you're pregnant, right?

770
01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:16.542 line:80%
-What do you want?
-Let's go.

771
01:06:17.542 --> 01:06:19.917 line:80%
Let's go. Follow me back to Malaysia.

772
01:06:20.708 --> 01:06:23.375 line:80%
Adam! I have a husband, Adam.

773
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:27.250 line:80%
Husband?

774
01:06:28.042 --> 01:06:29.167 line:80%
Do you realize?

775
01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:33.583 line:80%
You have to wait three months
before getting married again.

776
01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:35.250 line:80%
Because we slept together.

777
01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:38.917 line:80%
-Don't make up your own terms.
-You think I'm making it up?

778
01:06:41.708 --> 01:06:45.792 line:80%
I've asked the ustaz. Lawyers.
Those who are experts in Islamic marriage.

779
01:06:46.417 --> 01:06:50.458 line:80%
And your marriage with Reyhan was invalid.

780
01:06:55.417 --> 01:07:00.667 line:80%
And I'm sure you're carrying my child.

781
01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:18.583 line:80%
Okay, Dewi.

782
01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:22.958 line:80%
I'm not here to piss you off…

783
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.167 line:80%
or to attack you.

784
01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:31.792 line:80%
I just don't want you to continue sinning.

785
01:07:32.958 --> 01:07:33.958 line:80%
That's all.

786
01:07:41.042 --> 01:07:42.042 line:80%
I…

787
01:07:44.667 --> 01:07:45.958 line:80%
-I…
-Dewi!

788
01:07:46.792 --> 01:07:48.167 line:80%
Go to your room,

789
01:07:49.208 --> 01:07:52.417 line:80%
pack your stuff,
and we'll go back to Malaysia.

790
01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.917 line:80%
I want you to leave now.

791
01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:03.792 line:80%
-Dewi…
-Leave!

792
01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:08.542 line:80%
Leave!

793
01:08:34.958 --> 01:08:37.000 line:80%
I'll still wait for you, Dewi.

794
01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:03.792 line:80%
Just admit it!You just came back from there, right?

795
01:09:05.833 --> 01:09:08.000 line:80%
-Admit it!
-Stop being rough.

796
01:09:08.083 --> 01:09:09.833 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

797
01:09:14.458 --> 01:09:16.042 line:80%
Why are you helping me?

798
01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:17.708 line:80%
I didn't ask for it.

799
01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:22.167 line:80%
Am I wrong to help you as a friend?

800
01:09:23.833 --> 01:09:24.833 line:80%
A friend?

801
01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:30.542 line:80%
Yes.

802
01:09:31.083 --> 01:09:35.208 line:80%
Now, then, and forever,
we'll end up just as friends.

803
01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:43.625 line:80%
I've cared about you all the while.

804
01:09:46.208 --> 01:09:47.250 line:80%
I know.

805
01:09:47.833 --> 01:09:49.625 line:80%
You furthered your study in Syria.

806
01:09:49.708 --> 01:09:52.208 line:80%
You left the country for work purposes.

807
01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:56.042 line:80%
You said that was your world.

808
01:09:58.917 --> 01:09:59.917 line:80%
Did you know?

809
01:10:01.917 --> 01:10:03.875 line:80%
My world disappeared when you left.

810
01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:15.375 line:80%
Aliyah, I've always said.

811
01:10:15.458 --> 01:10:18.333 line:80%
-I had my own reasons to go abroad.
-Yes.

812
01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:19.875 line:80%
Yes.

813
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.917 line:80%
You've always told me to be independent.

814
01:10:23.542 --> 01:10:25.000 line:80%
That's why I got married.

815
01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:28.708 line:80%
If this…

816
01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:33.792 line:80%
If this is a test from God…

817
01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:39.000 line:80%
I'll be strong.

818
01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:40.417 line:80%
Hey, hey.

819
01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.708 line:80%
You don't have to worry.
I can settle my own problems.

820
01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:51.042 line:80%
Yes.

821
01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:53.958 line:80%
Take care.

822
01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:58.458 line:80%
You're going to be a father soon.

823
01:11:02.417 --> 01:11:03.417 line:80%
Aliyah!

824
01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:16.583 line:80%
There is no God but Allah.

825
01:11:18.292 --> 01:11:21.125 line:80%
There is no God but Allah.

826
01:11:26.292 --> 01:11:29.792 line:80%
There is no God but Allah.

827
01:11:30.667 --> 01:11:31.750 line:80%
Peace be upon you.

828
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.458 line:80%
And unto you too.

829
01:11:40.292 --> 01:11:41.458 line:80%
You came home early?

830
01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:44.583 line:80%
I had some work to do.

831
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.500 line:80%
Reyhan…

832
01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.375 line:80%
I have something to tell you.

833
01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:08.792 line:80%
Yes? How can I help?

835
01:12:19.292 --> 01:12:21.250 line:80%
I've made a decision.

836
01:12:21.708 --> 01:12:23.000 line:80%
What decision?

837
01:12:23.667 --> 01:12:25.417 line:80%
It's not you that has to go…

838
01:12:29.292 --> 01:12:30.292 line:80%
but me.

839
01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:35.083 line:80%
We already talked about this yesterday
and everything was clear.

840
01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:38.917 line:80%
It's not my intention
to disappoint you, Reyhan.

841
01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:43.125 line:80%
But I have to go.

842
01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:44.958 line:80%
Don't, please.

843
01:12:47.792 --> 01:12:48.917 line:80%
Don't touch me!

844
01:12:49.583 --> 01:12:50.625 line:80%
What?

845
01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.750 line:80%
I'm your husband, Dewi.

846
01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:56.750 line:80%
I'm your husband!

847
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:58.750 line:80%
I'm your husb…

848
01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:04.375 line:80%
Hello.

849
01:13:05.458 --> 01:13:06.958 line:80%
I can't go to the office.

850
01:13:10.875 --> 01:13:11.875 line:80%
Why?

851
01:13:15.375 --> 01:13:16.833 line:80%
Okay.

852
01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:24.458 line:80%
Sorry, I have to go.

853
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000 line:80%
Listen.

854
01:13:29.292 --> 01:13:32.833 line:80%
All the problems you're facing now
are meant for you.

855
01:13:34.917 --> 01:13:36.875 line:80%
It's a test from God for us.

856
01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:39.958 line:80%
You have to be strong, Dewi.

857
01:13:40.542 --> 01:13:41.625 line:80%
Peace be upon you.

858
01:14:01.417 --> 01:14:02.500 line:80%
Peace be upon you.

859
01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:06.667 line:80%
And unto you too.

860
01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:25.625 line:80%
You're the one who made Dewi change.

861
01:14:27.833 --> 01:14:29.542 line:80%
She's my wife now.

862
01:14:31.875 --> 01:14:33.375 line:80%
I haven't said anything.

863
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000 line:80%
Do you have five minutes?

864
01:14:36.583 --> 01:14:37.917 line:80%
I'll give you a minute.

865
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.792 line:80%
I came from far to tell you

866
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.208 line:80%
something that could change your life,
but you're arrogant.

867
01:14:44.292 --> 01:14:47.125 line:80%
-Your time is up.
-I'm not here to argue.

868
01:14:47.792 --> 01:14:49.792 line:80%
I want to talk to you, man to man.

869
01:14:52.167 --> 01:14:53.625 line:80%
Don't you feel bad for Dewi?

870
01:14:54.792 --> 01:14:55.792 line:80%
What did you say?

871
01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.792 line:80%
Your marriage is invalid!

872
01:15:12.125 --> 01:15:13.125 line:80%
Your time is up!

873
01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:18.250 line:80%
Reyhan!

874
01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:20.042 line:80%
Reyhan!

875
01:16:05.333 --> 01:16:08.625 line:80%
Reyhan!

876
01:16:13.458 --> 01:16:14.917 line:80%
Reyhan!

877
01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:42.417 line:80%
Reyhan!

878
01:17:24.625 --> 01:17:28.500 line:80%
All the problems you're facing noware meant for you.

879
01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:31.042 line:80%
It's a test from God for us.

880
01:17:32.083 --> 01:17:33.417 line:80%
You have to be strong.

881
01:17:53.917 --> 01:17:55.500 line:80%
You know what "Dewi" means?

882
01:17:57.417 --> 01:17:59.583 line:80%
Dewi means "the queen of all angels."

883
01:18:04.667 --> 01:18:07.792 line:80%
I also feel sympathy for Dewi
for the death…

884
01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.458 line:80%
-of her husband.
-And?

885
01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:14.500 line:80%
Why did you ask me to come?

886
01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:20.333 line:80%
You must know that Dewi has been pregnant
for three months.

887
01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:25.292 line:80%
It's been three months, right?
So, you should know who her husband is.

888
01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:33.875 line:80%
I want to take responsibility
for what my brother has done to Dewi.

889
01:18:34.458 --> 01:18:36.125 line:80%
What do you mean by "responsibility"?

890
01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:38.625 line:80%
I'll pay for all the costs
to abort the child.

891
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:41.458 line:80%
I seek forgiveness from God.

892
01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:42.542 line:80%
I know

893
01:18:43.167 --> 01:18:46.958 line:80%
you and Dewi will use the child
against Adam

894
01:18:47.042 --> 01:18:48.125 line:80%
and trap him.

895
01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:49.458 line:80%
Thank you, Ms. Tasya.

896
01:18:50.958 --> 01:18:51.958 line:80%
I'm going now.

897
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000 line:80%
Aunty.

898
01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:56.458 line:80%
You have to understand.

899
01:18:57.042 --> 01:19:00.250 line:80%
I just want to protect my brother
from that crazy girl.

900
01:19:00.708 --> 01:19:02.042 line:80%
Don't you worry.

901
01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:05.792 line:80%
Dewi will leave him alone.

902
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:08.667 line:80%
How can you guarantee that?

903
01:19:09.125 --> 01:19:11.958 line:80%
I swear by God's name,
I won't meet Adam ever again.

904
01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.667 line:80%
That's the only guarantee I can give.

905
01:19:18.875 --> 01:19:21.708 line:80%
This is all a test from God, Dewi.

906
01:19:24.417 --> 01:19:27.083 line:80%
Reyhan may not be together
with me anymore…

907
01:19:33.125 --> 01:19:35.708 line:80%
but his spirit will always be with me.

908
01:19:58.375 --> 01:20:00.167 line:80%
She swore she wouldn't see you anymore.

909
01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:02.292 line:80%
You made her swear.

910
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:04.083 line:80%
Who said so?

911
01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.208 line:80%
She complained to you? Her grandma?

912
01:20:09.333 --> 01:20:11.917 line:80%
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving.

913
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.500 line:80%
-Then where are you staying?
-Wherever!

914
01:20:14.583 --> 01:20:17.625 line:80%
Who's going to take care of Dad's office?

915
01:20:17.708 --> 01:20:19.708 line:80%
You don't have to look for me anymore.

916
01:20:20.417 --> 01:20:21.417 line:80%
What?

917
01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:26.167 line:80%
So? You can settle it on your own.
You're so annoying!

918
01:20:27.167 --> 01:20:28.167 line:80%
Adam!

919
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000 line:80%
Adam!

920
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:31.750 line:80%
Adam!

921
01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:35.125 line:80%
Adam, stop!

922
01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:37.583 line:80%
Adam!

923
01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:39.833 line:80%

Maybe…

962
01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:46.875 line:80%
It's because you knew Reyhan
longer than me.

963

So…

964

01:24:51.125 --> 01:24:53.667 line:80%
Dewi is already traumatized
by yesterday's incident.

976
01:24:54.792 --> 01:24:56.333 line:80%
I can't hurt her anymore.

977
01:24:56.417 --> 01:24:58.625 line:80%
But how long do you want to keep hiding?

978
01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:02.792 line:80%
Until she forgets Adam.

979
01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:06.042 line:80%
-What do you mean?
-Dewi has to choose between me or Adam.

980
01:25:06.708 --> 01:25:10.083 line:80%
Yes, but Dewi has sworn
she'll never be with Adam again.

981
01:25:10.167 --> 01:25:12.333 line:80%
That's because his sister forced her.

982
01:25:15.125 --> 01:25:18.417 line:80%
And the baby in Dewi's tummy is Adam's.

983
01:25:21.167 --> 01:25:22.500 line:80%
Adam has rights regarding her.

984
01:25:22.583 --> 01:25:24.167 line:80%
That's just your excuse.

985
01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:25.667 line:80%
You're confused, right?

986
01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:27.250 line:80%
You still love her.

987
01:25:32.292 --> 01:25:34.458 line:80%
Dewi has moved on.

988
01:25:34.542 --> 01:25:36.000 line:80%
She's accepted that you're gone.

989
01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:39.000 line:80%
Are you sure you can let her go?

990
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.375 line:80%
I told you. You're just confused.

991
01:25:47.917 --> 01:25:49.708 line:80%
Tomorrow, Dewi will go to Terengganu.

992
01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:52.167 line:80%
Yes.

993
01:25:53.917 --> 01:25:55.083 line:80%
You have time

994
01:25:55.167 --> 01:25:57.708 line:80%
to do what's best for you.

995
01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:00.875 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-And unto you too.

996
01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.250 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

997
01:26:35.792 --> 01:26:36.792 line:80%
Nothing.

998
01:26:50.792 --> 01:26:52.167 line:80%
Praise be to God.

999
01:26:54.708 --> 01:26:56.167 line:80%
What's wrong?

1000
01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:57.333 line:80%
Nothing.

1001
01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:05.292 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-And unto you too.

1002
01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:06.417 line:80%
Take care.

1003
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:34.792 line:80%
Dewi has moved on.She's accepted that you're gone.

1004
01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:36.458 line:80%
Are you sure you can let her go?

1005
01:27:51.417 --> 01:27:53.708 line:80%
They look happy, don't they?

1006
01:27:54.542 --> 01:27:56.208 line:80%
As if they don't have any problems.

1007
01:27:57.917 --> 01:28:00.250 line:80%
They've accepted their fate,

1008
01:28:00.333 --> 01:28:02.833 line:80%
so there shouldn't be any problems, right?

1009
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:12.417 line:80%
If we have good intentions,

1010
01:28:13.542 --> 01:28:15.500 line:80%
and God wills, he'll guide us.

1011
01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.958 line:80%
That's what late Reyhan said, Grandma.

1012
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:54.792 line:80%
Forget what happened before.

1013
01:28:54.875 --> 01:28:56.542 line:80%
I'm only asking for one thing.

1014
01:28:57.792 --> 01:28:59.125 line:80%
Go back to Adam.

1015
01:29:02.042 --> 01:29:03.750 line:80%
Did you forget about my oath?

1016
01:29:04.125 --> 01:29:05.292 line:80%
Cancel that oath.

1017
01:29:06.542 --> 01:29:07.708 line:80%
There must be a way.

1018
01:29:13.292 --> 01:29:14.292 line:80%
Dewi…

1019
01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:17.792 line:80%
If this is the way you want to punish me,

1020
01:29:18.542 --> 01:29:21.125 line:80%
you're punishing my whole family.

1021
01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:23.958 line:80%
I beg you so much.

1022
01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:28.875 line:80%
I'm willing to bow at your feet
if that's what you want.

1023
01:29:30.083 --> 01:29:31.083 line:80%
Please.

1024
01:29:31.917 --> 01:29:32.958 line:80%
Go back to Adam.

1025
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.750 line:80%
You can't just throw me awayjust like that.

1026
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:44.375 line:80%
After all that we've been through…

1027
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:48.917 line:80%
I'm willing to do anything for you.

1028
01:29:50.042 --> 01:29:52.833 line:80%
Even though I have to
turn my back on my family.

1029
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:08.250 line:80%
Adam?

1030
01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:12.167 line:80%
Adam, this is your sister.

1031
01:30:13.667 --> 01:30:14.708 line:80%
Adam.

1032
01:30:33.625 --> 01:30:34.625 line:80%
Where is she?

1033
01:30:48.417 --> 01:30:51.208 line:80%
-Her fetus is already big, ma'am.
-Is there a difference?

1034
01:30:51.292 --> 01:30:55.375 line:80%
-It'll put her life at risk.
-They said you can help abort babies.

1035
01:30:55.458 --> 01:30:57.500 line:80%
Just do it. I'll take responsibility.

1036
01:31:05.125 --> 01:31:08.125 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be unto you too.

1037
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:53.333 line:80%
Peace be upon you.

1038
01:31:54.333 --> 01:31:56.958 line:80%
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be unto you too.

1039
01:32:10.708 --> 01:32:11.708 line:80%
Dewi is not here.

1040
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000 line:80%
How do you know?

1041
01:32:16.208 --> 01:32:17.583 line:80%
Grandma Suraya told me.

1042
01:32:18.667 --> 01:32:19.958 line:80%
Grandma is over there?

1043
01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:23.042 line:80%
-I want to meet her.
-For what?

1044
01:32:23.125 --> 01:32:26.792 line:80%
-I want to talk to her…
-Hey. Just wait! She'll be back soon.

1045
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:21.792 line:80%
Peace be upon you.

1046
01:33:24.458 --> 01:33:25.625 line:80%
Help me, Grandma.

1047
01:33:26.208 --> 01:33:27.208 line:80%
Dewi?

1048
01:33:38.292 --> 01:33:39.583 line:80%
Oh!

1049
01:33:39.667 --> 01:33:42.167 line:80%
Oh, God! Dewi…

1050
01:33:42.833 --> 01:33:44.292 line:80%
Dewi!

1051
01:33:45.125 --> 01:33:47.625 line:80%
Dewi!

1052
01:33:48.292 --> 01:33:49.500 line:80%
Oh, God!

1053
01:33:51.083 --> 01:33:52.917 line:80%
Dewi! Oh, God!

1054
01:33:54.208 --> 01:33:56.375 line:80%
-Dewi!
-Dewi!

1055
01:34:19.708 --> 01:34:20.708 line:80%
Dewi.

1056
01:34:28.625 --> 01:34:30.292 line:80%
I knew you were still alive.

1057
01:34:33.292 --> 01:34:34.667 line:80%
Dewi!

1058
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:36.792 line:80%
Dewi.

1059
01:34:39.167 --> 01:34:41.000 line:80%
How did this happen, Dewi?

1060
01:34:42.625 --> 01:34:43.667 line:80%
Oh, God.

1061
01:34:45.333 --> 01:34:48.667 line:80%
-Grandma…
-Dewi? Oh, God.

1062
01:34:49.667 --> 01:34:51.125 line:80%
Oh, my God! Help me.

1063
01:34:51.708 --> 01:34:53.042 line:80%
Hey, you!

1064
01:34:53.875 --> 01:34:57.083 line:80%
Help! Call an ambulance! Now!

1065
01:34:58.542 --> 01:34:59.792 line:80%
Oh, God.

1066
01:34:59.875 --> 01:35:03.375 line:80%
-How did this happen, Dewi?
-Adam!

1067
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.917 line:80%
Shut up, Adam!

1068
01:35:07.417 --> 01:35:13.417 line:80%
How did this happen
to my granddaughter, Adam? Oh, God.

1069
01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.250 line:80%
It's my fault, Grandma.

1070
01:35:16.333 --> 01:35:20.750 line:80%
You are at fault too.
It's because of you two.

1071
01:35:21.375 --> 01:35:22.667 line:80%
We are all at fault…

1072
01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:28.083 line:80%
because we're just humans,

1073
01:35:29.583 --> 01:35:30.583 line:80%
not angels.

1074
01:35:42.042 --> 01:35:43.042 line:80%
Adam.

1075
01:35:46.625 --> 01:35:47.833 line:80%
Oh, God.

1076
01:35:49.208 --> 01:35:52.208 line:80%
You were the first guy that I loved.

1077
01:36:00.333 --> 01:36:02.750 line:80%
But, our love was too fragile…

1078
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.458 line:80%
As fragile as your faith, Adam.

1079
01:36:16.375 --> 01:36:17.833 line:80%
We forgot about God.

1080
01:36:22.167 --> 01:36:24.958 line:80%
But God has never forgotten us.

1081
01:36:39.542 --> 01:36:40.625 line:80%
Reyhan…

1082
01:36:54.958 --> 01:36:58.208 line:80%
You were the first guy
that made me realize…

1083
01:37:02.792 --> 01:37:05.875 line:80%
God won't test His servants with

1084
01:37:07.625 --> 01:37:09.500 line:80%
anything they can't handle.

1085
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:18.583 line:80%
I'm thankful God gathered us all
at such a noble place.

1086
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.917 line:80%
Dewi, let me be with you again.

1087
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.542 line:80%
Let's start over.

1088
01:37:29.083 --> 01:37:31.042 line:80%
Okay? Let's start over.

1089
01:37:37.667 --> 01:37:38.708 line:80%
Dewi…

1090
01:37:38.792 --> 01:37:41.250 line:80%
-Dewi!
-Dewi!

1091
01:37:41.708 --> 01:37:44.750 line:80%
Dewi!

1092
01:39:45.333 --> 01:39:47.917 line:80%
POLICE
