(MAKING AIR WHIZZING NOISES)

1249

It'd sound like lasers.

1250
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:32.905 line:83%
Thank you
for that description.

1251
00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:35.241 line:83%
Mr. Joyner,
let me explain something.

1252
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:36.743 line:83%
Bob's last four psych evals

1253
00:50:36.826 --> 00:50:39.787 line:83%
show a person rapidly
losing his grip on reality.

1254
00:50:39.954 --> 00:50:43.207 line:83%
Bob became obsessed with a ghost,
a figment of his imagination

1255
00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:45.084 line:83%
he started calling
The Black Badger.

1256
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:47.170 line:83%
This obsession led
to an instability,

1257
00:50:47.336 --> 00:50:50.006 line:83%
first reported by
his partner Phil three weeks ago.

1258
00:50:50.089 --> 00:50:52.592 line:83%
Just before Phil
was killed in the field.

1259
00:50:52.759 --> 00:50:54.135 line:83%
Do you know how Phil died?

1260
00:50:54.302 --> 00:50:56.929 line:83%
Yeah, Bob told me that
The Black Badger killed him.

1261
00:51:01.184 --> 00:51:02.226 line:83%
What?

1262
00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:04.270 line:83%
What?

1263
00:51:04.353 --> 00:51:08.024 line:83%
Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone
is The Black Badger.

1264
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:12.320 line:83%
Phil was Bob's partner
of six years. His best friend.

1265
00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:13.404 line:83%
See you on the other side.

1266
00:51:13.571 --> 00:51:14.614 line:83%
See you on the other side.

(BEEPING)

1268
00:51:15.865 --> 00:51:17.325 line:83%
Hey, Bob!

1269
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.994 line:83%
AGENT HARRIS:
After he stole the satellite encryption codes,

1270
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:21.162 line:83%
Bob betrayed Phil.

1271
00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:22.246 line:83%
No!

1272
00:51:22.997 --> 00:51:25.625 line:83%
He killed him
to cover his tracks.

1273
00:51:29.629 --> 00:51:32.757 line:83%
And after that,
Bob went rogue.

1274
00:51:32.924 --> 00:51:34.634 line:83%
This is all
that's left of Phil.

1275
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.222 line:83%
Um...

1276
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:40.973 line:83%
This is Pornhub.

1277
00:51:41.307 --> 00:51:44.560 line:83%
Oh. Shit, shit, shit.
Sorry.

1278
00:51:45.436 --> 00:51:46.479 line:83%
There you go.

1279
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:48.022 line:83%
CALVIN: Oh!

1280
00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:50.608 line:83%
Oh, God!
Oh, I didn't see that coming.

1281
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:52.360 line:83%
Oh, man!

1282
00:51:53.653 --> 00:51:54.695 line:83%
It's a hell
of a way to go.

1283
00:51:54.779 --> 00:51:55.822 line:83%
Okay, wait a minute.

1284
00:51:55.905 --> 00:51:58.533 line:83%
Why wouldn't Bob just
go sell the satellite encryption codes himself?

1285
00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:00.451 line:83%
Because in a black market
blind-bidding situation,

1286
00:52:00.535 --> 00:52:02.286 line:83%
the buyer and seller,
they don't know each other.

1287
00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.039 line:83%
They need the auction site
to tell them exactly where to meet up

1288
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:06.541 line:83%
and when to make
the exchange.

1289
00:52:06.624 --> 00:52:10.086 line:83%
The transaction number
from the auction site gives them that,

1290
00:52:10.169 --> 00:52:12.213 line:83%
which means
Bob still needs you.

1291
00:52:13.005 --> 00:52:16.259 line:83%
Which is why we find ourselves
in a little catch-and-release scenario.

1292
00:52:16.342 --> 00:52:18.594 line:83%
You are the only one Bob trusts.

1293
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:20.721 line:83%
That's why we're
putting you in the field.

1294
00:52:20.805 --> 00:52:22.723 line:83%
The next time
you're with Bob,

1295
00:52:23.808 --> 00:52:25.476 line:83%
press this button.

1296
00:52:25.643 --> 00:52:27.061 line:83%
We're going to have him cold.

1297
00:52:33.442 --> 00:52:35.152 line:83%
Now, go take care
of your marriage.

1298
00:52:35.611 --> 00:52:38.239 line:83%
Oh, one more thing.
Don't tell your wife shit.

1299
00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:40.616 line:83%
All right.

1300
00:52:42.535 --> 00:52:43.870 line:83%
I just don't know what's wrong.

1301
00:52:43.953 --> 00:52:45.496 line:83%
I mean, the man
that I married,

1302
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.790 line:83%
the person I knew
in high school,

1303
00:52:47.874 --> 00:52:51.252 line:83%
he was filled with
drive and desire.

1304
00:52:51.335 --> 00:52:53.588 line:83%
I mean, we used to sneak off
every lunch hour

1305
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:55.131 line:83%
and make out under
the gym bleachers.

1306
00:52:55.214 --> 00:52:57.216 line:83%
Like, that guy, back then,

1307
00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.343 line:83%
he wanted things, you know?

1308
00:52:59.635 --> 00:53:01.971 line:83%
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find the parking.

1309
00:53:02.054 --> 00:53:04.098 line:83%
Hi. No, no. It's okay.
We got started without you.

1310
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.892 line:83%
-Babe, Calvin, this is Dr. Dan.
-Okay.

1311
00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:07.476 line:83%
Hello, Calvin.

1312
00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.769 line:83%
-Hey.
-Oh, shit!

1313
00:53:08.853 --> 00:53:09.854 line:83%
Whoa, what's the matter?

1314
00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:12.189 line:83%
-Holy shit! Get behind me! Get behind me.
-What?

1315
00:53:12.273 --> 00:53:14.734 line:83%
It's okay, Maggie.
It's okay. Just relax.

1316
00:53:14.817 --> 00:53:17.236 line:83%
This is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process.

1317
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.279 line:83%
-It is?
-What?

1318
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:19.405 line:83%
It is. It absolutely is.

1319
00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:22.742 line:83%
Calvin, this is a very safe place.
Please, sit down.

1320
00:53:22.825 --> 00:53:24.702 line:83%
-This is not a safe place!
-No, no, honey, it's a safe place.

1321
00:53:24.785 --> 00:53:26.370 line:83%
No, this is most definitely
not a safe place!

1322
00:53:26.454 --> 00:53:28.372 line:83%
Me and my wife are leaving.
Let's go.

1323
00:53:28.456 --> 00:53:30.499 line:83%
No, no, no!
You are going to sit down

1324
00:53:30.583 --> 00:53:33.628 line:83%
and we are gonna go through
this therapeutic process...

1325
00:53:33.711 --> 00:53:35.546 line:83%
-Yes.
-...together, as a couple.

1326
00:53:36.464 --> 00:53:38.132 line:83%
Fine, fine, fine.

1327
00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:39.634 line:83%
-Sit down. Thank you.
-Fine.

1328
00:53:39.717 --> 00:53:40.760 line:83%
Fine.

1329
00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:42.720 line:83%
Okay, guys.
Why don't we start off

1330
00:53:42.803 --> 00:53:44.680 line:83%
with a little bit
of word association?

1331
00:53:44.764 --> 00:53:45.848 line:83%
Okay.

1332
00:53:46.182 --> 00:53:49.769 line:83%
This is exciting.
I've heard this can really open a couple up.

1333
00:53:49.894 --> 00:53:50.895 line:83%
BOB: Uh...

1334
00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.439 line:83%
Maggie, I'm going to
offer you a word

1335
00:53:53.564 --> 00:53:57.526 line:83%
and you respond
however you're moved to from here.

1336
00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:58.653 line:83%
Okay.

1337
00:53:58.736 --> 00:54:00.071 line:83%
-Black.
-White.

1338
00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:01.697 line:83%
-Water.
-Ocean.

1339
00:54:01.864 --> 00:54:04.033 line:83%
-Sunshine.
-Happy.

1340
00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:07.286 line:83%
-I'm very impressed, Maggie.
-Really?

1341
00:54:07.453 --> 00:54:08.663 line:83%
You're very in tune.

1342
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:10.623 line:83%
I'm very in tune.

1343
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:12.875 line:83%
Calvin, you're next.

1344
00:54:13.042 --> 00:54:15.002 line:83%
I do not want to do this.

1345
00:54:15.086 --> 00:54:17.588 line:83%
Relax, Calvin.
There are no wrong answers.

1346
00:54:17.672 --> 00:54:18.673 line:83%
Up.

1347
00:54:20.383 --> 00:54:21.384 line:83%
Down.

1348

Mmm.

1349
00:54:23.928 --> 00:54:25.221 line:83%
Mmm? What is that?

1350
00:54:25.304 --> 00:54:26.389 line:83%
What're you writing
in your book?

1351
00:54:26.555 --> 00:54:28.349 line:83%
-It's fine. Don't freak out.
-Nobody's freaking out.

1352
00:54:28.432 --> 00:54:29.684 line:83%
I just don't understand
the rules to the game.

1353
00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:30.851 line:83%
Freaking out.

1354
00:54:31.102 --> 00:54:33.145 line:83%
Let's switch gears
for a second, okay?

1355
00:54:33.229 --> 00:54:36.524 line:83%
Why don't we try a simple
role-playing exercise?

1356
00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:40.987 line:83%
Calvin, you be Calvin
and I will become Maggie.

1357
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:42.738 line:83%
(GASPS) Mmm.

1358
00:54:43.364 --> 00:54:44.657 line:83%
I'm confused.

1359
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.122 line:83%
It's called soul gazing.

1360
00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:54.834 line:83%
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

1361

-Maggie, this...
-Hey. Shh.

1362
00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.089 line:83%
There's no talking,
and don't look away.

1363
00:55:00.172 --> 00:55:01.382 line:83%
(WHISPERS)
Stare into my soul.

1364

-You are not my...
-Shh. There's no talking.

1365
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.012 line:83%
Babe, I'm not staring...

00:55:06.595 --> 00:55:09.724 line:83%
(WHISPERS) Me and you.
Stay with me. I'm your wife.

How could you hit your wife?

1370
00:55:15.938 --> 00:55:17.314 line:83%
How can I what?

1371
00:55:17.398 --> 00:55:19.066 line:83%
-You hit your wife!
-No!

1372
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:20.151 line:83%
-He hit me!
-Okay.

1373
00:55:20.234 --> 00:55:21.235 line:83%
-He hit you!
-Okay.

1374
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:22.570 line:83%
You hit us!

1375

-I'm swaddling you.
-I know what you're doing.

1376

-I'm swaddling you.
-I know what you're...

1377
00:55:30.995 --> 00:55:32.079 line:83%
Come here.

1378
00:55:32.163 --> 00:55:33.414 line:83%
Oh, my God!

1379
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.294 line:83%
You know what?
We're leaving! Let's go!

1380
00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:40.546 line:83%
This is not real.

1381
00:55:40.629 --> 00:55:42.256 line:83%
It's real to me.

1382
00:55:42.423 --> 00:55:43.716 line:83%
You know what, Calvin?

1383
00:55:43.799 --> 00:55:45.926 line:83%
If you can't commit
to working on our marriage,

1384
00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:47.678 line:83%
then you need to
let me know.

1385
00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:49.722 line:83%
-Maggie, you...

-Oh, my God!

1388
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.477 line:83%
You're...
Something's not right.

1389
00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.855 line:83%
Come on, Jet.
Come on, listen. Come on, Jet!

1390
00:55:57.938 --> 00:55:59.732 line:83%
Now, I know things
got a little rough there at the end.

1391
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:00.941 line:83%
But the truth is,
with all the heat

1392
00:56:01.025 --> 00:56:02.068 line:83%
that you have
coming down on you,

1393
00:56:02.151 --> 00:56:04.153 line:83%
Maggie is definitely safer
without you.

1394
00:56:05.321 --> 00:56:07.239 line:83%
And, trust me,
when this whole thing is said and done,

1395
00:56:07.323 --> 00:56:10.367 line:83%
and you basically save the entire free world,
she's going to forgive you.

1396
00:56:10.451 --> 00:56:11.952 line:83%
It'll all work itself out.

1397
00:56:12.036 --> 00:56:14.080 line:83%
It'll all work itself out?

1398
00:56:14.163 --> 00:56:16.248 line:83%
Okay, Bob, you know,
I'm sick of playing games with you.

1399

I had nothing to do with this.

1402

He's fine. I'll get you

All right, Jet. I see that Harris
has given you a button to push.

1407
00:56:36.143 --> 00:56:38.771 line:83%
Relax, I would've taken the same deal,
too, if I was in your shoes.

1408
00:56:38.896 --> 00:56:41.190 line:83%
Otherwise,
she wouldn't let you out of her sight, right?

1409
00:56:41.273 --> 00:56:42.691 line:83%
It makes perfect sense.

1410
00:56:44.026 --> 00:56:45.569 line:83%
But you're not going to
press the button, right?

This ain't the time
to bullshit me.

Okay, my ass is sweating.

1415
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.205 line:83%
I'm nervous.
Don't bullshit me!

1416
00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:58.374 line:83%
Of course not, dude.
Hey, come on!

1417
00:56:58.541 --> 00:56:59.959 line:83%
Of course I don't
have the codes.

1418
00:57:00.042 --> 00:57:01.502 line:83%
Why would I go through
all this trouble, then?

1419
00:57:01.669 --> 00:57:03.212 line:83%
I need your skill set, Jet,

1420
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.173 line:83%

numbers to the winning bid.

We already know
it's going down tonight

1422

from the countdown
on your computer.

1423
00:57:09.718 --> 00:57:11.220 line:83%
Now, all we need
is the where.

1424
00:57:11.637 --> 00:57:13.806 line:83%
And the bank transaction numbers
will give us the where.

1425

That's why I need you.

1426

Your job gives you
access to exactly that kind of information.

1427

Then we can get The Badger,
we can get the buyer in one fell swoop.

You gotta believe me.

1431
00:57:36.912 --> 00:57:38.873 line:83%
Can't you just get us
the transaction number?

1432
00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:41.834 line:83%
Not when the money originates
from an offshore account.

1433
00:57:41.917 --> 00:57:43.544 line:83%
When that happens,
then only a certified

international banking
official can access it.

1435
00:57:45.254 --> 00:57:46.755 line:83%
But, I mean,
it shouldn't be a problem.

1436
00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:49.425 line:83%
We just give this guy the offshore account
numbers that you gave me,

1437
00:57:49.508 --> 00:57:51.051 line:83%
then he can give us
the transaction number

1438
00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:53.387 line:83%
without knowing that
he's committing treason when he does it.

Hey, besides, it's only
treason if we're wrong.

It didn't just happen.
I did it.

1504
