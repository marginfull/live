EPISODE 14

2
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:39.915 line:80%
Thank you.

3
00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:47.715 line:80%
The floor's slippery. Careful.

4
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.633 line:80%
It's fine. You don't have to.

5
00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.803 line:80%
I told you not to move!

6
00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.436 line:80%
What are you doing?

7
00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:02.354 line:80%
It's fine.

8
00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:05.524 line:80%
The doctors were just worried.
I don't need all that.

9
00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:09.111 line:80%
The smart doctors know what they're doing.
Listen to them.

10
00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:12.990 line:80%
Don't do anything
on your own from now on, okay?

11
00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.327 line:80%
You don't listen.

12
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.625 line:80%
Are you hungry?

13
00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:30.925 line:80%
What are you doing?

14
00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:35.554 line:80%
Let's just stay like this.

15
00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:54.740 line:80%
When I thought it was the end,
I regretted it so much.

16
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.953 line:80%
I was given another chance
but wasn't honest again.

17
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:07.211 line:80%
You won't die.

18
00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:12.424 line:80%
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

19
00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.183 line:80%
No, I'm sorry.

20
00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:29.567 line:80%
Yu-ra isn't an easy opponent.

21
00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:34.363 line:80%
Even after I saw
her unimaginable true colors,

22
00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:36.991 line:80%
it took over three years
to end it with her.

23
00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:41.787 line:80%
Someone being beyond your imagination...

24
00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:43.789 line:80%
I know what you mean.

25
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.919 line:80%
When you spend a long time with someone,

26
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.255 line:80%
it's hard to see that person properly.

27
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.134 line:80%
You try not to believe it.

28
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.306 line:80%
You only realize it after you see the end.

29
00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.394 line:80%
Your ex-fiancée is trying to kill me,

30
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.189 line:80%
and Min-hwan and Su-min get paid if I die.

31
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.484 line:80%
They joined forces.

32
00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:20.492 line:80%
Ms. Yang's husband's having an affair.

33
00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:25.539 line:80%
I think my fate moved to Ms. Yang.

34
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:29.126 line:80%
It's not over with their marriage.

35
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.046 line:80%
There's something more.
I have to find that out.

36
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.048 line:80%
To protect Ms. Yang.

37
00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.428 line:80%
Just stay by my side.

38
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.142 line:80%
RECENT DESTINATIONS

39
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.527 line:80%
Wait for me.

40
00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:39.196 line:80%
Stop it!

43
00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.849 line:80%
The police think
a drunk driver caused the accident.

44
00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:10.352 line:80%
They'll never catch her.

45
00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:13.814 line:80%
We put someone
on Yu-ra, Min-hwan, and Su-min.

46
00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.608 line:80%
But we haven't caught anything yet.

47
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:21.196 line:80%
We put people on them after the accident,
so there's no lead.

48
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:29.121 line:80%
If you knew in advance,
you should've discussed it with me first.

49
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.882 line:80%
I wasn't sure that you were on my side.

50
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:49.850 line:80%
I'm sorry, Seok-jun.

51
00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:00.861 line:80%
Don't. I'm not that angry.

52
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:07.701 line:80%
The only way is
to find Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk.

53
00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.579 line:80%
They must be heading for Incheon.

54
00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.706 line:80%
And Oh Yu-ra must be looking for them.

55
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.249 line:80%
I'm sure.

56
00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:17.086 line:80%
It's a matter of who's faster.

57
00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.048 line:80%
By the way, how long
do you have to wear the sling?

58
00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.637 line:80%
Until Ji-won tells me to stop wearing it.

59
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.722 line:80%
Honestly, I can take it off now.

60
00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:32.518 line:80%
But she promised to take care of me
while I had it on.

61
00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.206 line:80%
Ji-hyuk.

62
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.417 line:80%
Do you remember anything more
from the accident?

63
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.882 line:80%
Not really.

64
00:07:03.966 --> 00:07:06.426 line:80%
I went to the memorial hall to see you.

65
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.428 line:80%
The car broke down there.

66
00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:10.889 line:80%
Is that all?

67
00:07:13.517 --> 00:07:17.813 line:80%
Maybe not,
but I can't think of anything right now.

68
00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:23.944 line:80%
-Ji-won?
-Yeah?

69
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:26.405 line:80%
-Eggs.
-Okay.

70
00:07:31.243 --> 00:07:32.119 line:80%
What else?

71
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.873 line:80%
I should go. I'll see you tomorrow.

72
00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.169 line:80%
Thanks for today.

73
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:46.842 line:80%
What's wrong?

74
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:48.802 line:80%
Ji-won.

75
00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:50.220 line:80%
Does it hurt again?

76
00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:58.645 line:80%
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:02.399 line:80%
It's the only thing I could think of.

78
00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:09.823 line:80%
I can't believe you.

79
00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:12.951 line:80%
Can you...

80
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:16.997 line:80%
stay the night?

81
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.424 line:80%
Good night.

82
00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:29.384 line:80%
I'll get the light.

83
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:42.940 line:80%
Mr. Yu, what are you doing?

84
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.360 line:80%
I understand what you mean,
so I'll just hold you.

85
00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.240 line:80%
It still hurts. I swear.

86
00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.500 line:80%
Always be by my side.

87
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.296 line:80%
No matter what you do,

88
00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.259 line:80%
do it by my side.

89
00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.056 line:80%
That's all I need.

90
00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.946 line:80%
Are you up? I was going to wake you.

91
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:18.493 line:80%
Do you want strawberries? It's so good.
It's the yummiest I've had...

92
00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.875 line:80%
What? Did you have a nightmare?

93
00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.970 line:80%
Wait. Does your arm not hurt?
Is it okay now?

94
00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:40.307 line:80%
It hurts.

95
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.518 line:80%
No, you were just...

96
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.982 line:80%
Wow. You know how to lie now.

97
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.817 line:80%
It's true.

98
00:10:55.906 --> 00:10:57.449 line:80%
What did you dream about?

99
00:10:58.617 --> 00:10:59.826 line:80%
It's a secret.

100
00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:09.002 line:80%
I know we're both assistant managers,
but I'm acting manager,

101
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:12.005 line:80%
so I have to say this.

102
00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:16.635 line:80%
You take a day off too often,
as if you're part of the owner's family.

103
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.762 line:80%
I had some issues at home.

104
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:24.518 line:80%
You did? Is there anyone here
who doesn't have a home?

105
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.854 line:80%
Is there anyone here
who doesn't have issues at home?

106
00:11:27.938 --> 00:11:31.858 line:80%
Darn it. Why did the personnel decision
have to be made now?

107
00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:34.903 line:80%
That jerk is just so lucky.

108
00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:38.448 line:80%
There's so much work
piling up around us...

109
00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:41.868 line:80%
Unbelievable.

110
00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:45.330 line:80%
Shall I help?

111
00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.251 line:80%
-Ms. Yang!
-Ms. Yang!

112
00:11:52.254 --> 00:11:53.964 line:80%
Is it okay to work now?

113
00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:57.717 line:80%
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

114
00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:08.186 line:80%
What?

115
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.148 line:80%
What are you doing?
Why couldn't I reach you?

116
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.234 line:80%
Kang Ji-won came to work
as if nothing happened.

117
00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:16.486 line:80%
What the hell is going on?

118
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.489 line:80%
Ji-hyuk's been discharged.
That must be why.

119
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.284 line:80%
I told you to act like nothing happened.

120
00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.411 line:80%
What do you think she'll do?

121
00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:29.291 line:80%
It's easy to pull her hair and yell
if you want to fight.

122
00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.752 line:80%
Be patient
if you don't want to live like a bum.

123
00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:36.089 line:80%
Will you come to the gym later?

124
00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.759 line:80%
You'll feel better
after we talk while working out.

125
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.682 line:80%
This brat is so rude.

126
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.977 line:80%
I shouldn't get involved
with such low-standard people,

127
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.189 line:80%
but nothing gets done
if I don't do it myself.

128
00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:56.485 line:80%
We found Man-sik and Hui-suk.
They were scared, so they tried to hide.

129
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.370 line:80%
Hello, it's Jeong Man-sik.

130
00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.414 line:80%
It was hard to find you.

131
00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:13.251 line:80%
Why did you hide? We're in the same boat.

132
00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:17.172 line:80%
No, it's not because
we couldn't trust you.

133
00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:19.341 line:80%
We can't trust my daughter.

134
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.384 line:80%
Just trust me now.

135
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:24.262 line:80%
I never abandon my family.

136
00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:28.141 line:80%
How about going to China for a while?

137
00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:29.935 line:80%
Shanghai is beautiful.

138
00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:34.731 line:80%
You can also have some fun in the water
in Hangzhou and Suzhou.

139
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:54.751 line:80%
Aren't I pathetic?

140
00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.338 line:80%
At this age, when I feel anxious,

141
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.715 line:80%
I have nowhere to go but work.

142
00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.261 line:80%
Because you have friends here.

143
00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.931 line:80%
I was worried
and going to go see you anyway.

144
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.520 line:80%
No, I'm barging in tonight.

145
00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:16.898 line:80%
I reported it to the police for adultery.

146
00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:20.485 line:80%
Right. This was
before the law was abolished.

147
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.574 line:80%
Whenever I was admitted to the hospital,

148
00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.410 line:80%
he brought her home.

149
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.497 line:80%
So I told him I was being admitted today.

150
00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:35.917 line:80%
His car dashcam

151
00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:40.046 line:80%
caught them doing dirty things in the car.

152
00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.717 line:80%
But there's no video. I think it's broken.

153
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.262 line:80%
And the police said
audio wasn't enough proof.

154
00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:50.056 line:80%
The dashcam video's not working?

155
00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:51.933 line:80%
Ridiculous, right?

156
00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:57.147 line:80%
I really didn't want to go this far,

157
00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:02.485 line:80%
but I made up my mind
and broke the door lock on my way out.

158
00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:11.369 line:80%
Ms. Yang.

159
00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:13.830 line:80%
Can I come with you?

160
00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:22.589 line:80%
Is that her?

161
00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:23.882 line:80%
Yes.

162
00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:28.261 line:80%
Okay, your husband went in 30 minutes ago.

163
00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:29.721 line:80%
Let's go in 10 minutes.

164
00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.291 line:80%
Who are you people?

165
00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:00.043 line:80%
What? What is it?

166
00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.212 line:80%
What's going on?

167
00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.101 line:80%
What?

168
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.310 line:80%
Hey.

169
00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.479 line:80%
Why are you here at this hour?

170
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.234 line:80%
What?

171
00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:32.158 line:80%
He said you were in the hospital.
I came to give him some side dishes.

172
00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.160 line:80%
Maybe I was out of line.

173
00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:38.206 line:80%
I see him at the restaurant often,
so I considered him family.

174
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:40.583 line:80%
Hey.

175
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.336 line:80%
Did you suspect me?

176
00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:47.549 line:80%
Do you look down on me
since I work for your dad?

177
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.140 line:80%
-You two...
-What? What is it?

178
00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:59.269 line:80%
Whatever.

179
00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.772 line:80%
Forget it. Just leave, all of you.

180
00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.024 line:80%
Get out. Hey, you too.

181
00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:08.027 line:80%
Don't bring anything here
saying you're worried.

182
00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.238 line:80%
Wow, you're making a joke of me.

183
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.824 line:80%
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

184
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.789 line:80%
Get out.

185
00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.464 line:80%
You should go too. I'll talk to him.

186
00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:33.803 line:80%
You're not leaving?

187
00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.486 line:80%
I'm leaving, but before I go...

188
00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.198 line:80%
What's she doing?

189
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.455 line:80%
What? What are you doing?

190
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.664 line:80%
What?

191
00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:29.901 line:80%
No, don't hit me.

192
00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.987 line:80%
If you touch her, I'll make you pay!

193
00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.368 line:80%
You're crazy!

194
00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.498 line:80%
I'm going to charge you for this!

195
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.083 line:80%
You came with the cops!

196
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.709 line:80%
Sir, this...

197
00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:50.505 line:80%
Isn't this property damage?
This woman used the golf club...

198
00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:51.798 line:80%
Stop it!

199
00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.813 line:80%
You're so shameless.

200
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.816 line:80%
Are you happy you weren't caught?

201
00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:14.946 line:80%
No, I know what you did in the car.

202
00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:19.492 line:80%
What? You wonder how much
insurance money you'll get if I die?

203
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:23.079 line:80%
You laughed about it.
Are you two even human?

204
00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:26.457 line:80%
What?

205
00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:29.002 line:80%
That's the car Yeon-ji rides.

206
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.462 line:80%
Aren't you ashamed?

207
00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.924 line:80%
You're a terrible person.

208
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.388 line:80%
What are you saying?

209
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:42.557 line:80%
You don't even have any proof.

210
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.058 line:80%
Hey, that's--

211
00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:49.898 line:80%
Why you...

212
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:07.916 line:80%
Are you okay?

213
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:14.380 line:80%
No, don't.

214
00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:15.965 line:80%
You crazy bastard!

215
00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.468 line:80%
No, wait! You can't do this.

216
00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.387 line:80%
-Hold her tight.
-Please calm down. Hold her.

217
00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.599 line:80%
Calm down. Please. You can't do this.

218
00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:38.613 line:80%
Are you okay, Ji-won?

219
00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:51.584 line:80%
I'll come back after work tomorrow.
Don't do anything until then.

220
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:55.463 line:80%
Thanks, Ji-won.

221
00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:59.717 line:80%
But it's my business,
so I'll handle it by myself.

222
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.390 line:80%
I realized earlier.
I don't think he'll break up that easily.

223
00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:08.101 line:80%
So I'll see a lawyer.

224
00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:10.687 line:80%
No...

225
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.898 line:80%
Don't ever meet him alone.

226
00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.984 line:80%
Just call me. I'll come.

227
00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:20.363 line:80%
Why are you saying such strange things?

228
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.032 line:80%
You're acting weird.

229
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:26.661 line:80%
I know that.

230
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.207 line:80%
But you would've gotten hurt badly
if it weren't for me earlier.

231
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.502 line:80%
Just do as I say this once.

232
00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:38.047 line:80%
I'll be by your side.

233
00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.682 line:80%
You said you'd meet a lawyer.

234
00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.517 line:80%
You can talk with me.

235
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.330 line:80%
Ms. Yang can trust Mr. Lee.

236
00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:13.458 line:80%
He always does what he says.

237
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.132 line:80%
My fate going to someone else...

238
00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:24.010 line:80%
I don't think it's a coincidence.

239
00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:30.641 line:80%
If the stress from her indifferent husband
caused her cancer,

240
00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:35.188 line:80%
where did the fate of being killed by him
come from?

241
00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:39.942 line:80%
The broken door lock.

242
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.528 line:80%
The red high heels.

243
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:45.073 line:80%
And the candy tin.

244
00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:51.079 line:80%
Husband having an affair
with someone close...

245
00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:57.794 line:80%
Or are those scumbags
after the insurance money?

246
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.429 line:80%
I'll take care of you when my wife dies.

247
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.687 line:80%
I know what I have to do.

248
00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:19.607 line:80%
Ji-hyuk,

249
00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:22.944 line:80%
I have to seduce Min-hwan.

250
00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:35.206 line:80%
Because Min-hwan must have an affair
and not care if his wife dies.

251
00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:47.760 line:80%
JEONG SU-MIN, JI-WON'S FRIEND

252
00:23:58.229 --> 00:24:02.024 line:80%
No, I have to make him think
that he needs to kill her.

253
00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:20.877 line:80%
I know it'll upset you,
but I have to do it.

254
00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:26.883 line:80%
If I don't give the fate of being killed
by a cheating husband to Su-min,

255
00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:30.428 line:80%
Ms. Yang will die.

256
00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:43.566 line:80%
Can I do this?

257
00:24:56.037 --> 00:24:57.038 line:80%
Okay.

258
00:24:58.164 --> 00:25:01.000 line:80%
Do whatever you want.

259
00:25:07.298 --> 00:25:08.799 line:80%
I'll help you.

260
00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:53.052 line:80%
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir?

261
00:25:53.135 --> 00:25:55.554 line:80%
You take over the meal kit project.

262
00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:59.600 line:80%
Pardon? But the person in charge is...

263
00:25:59.684 --> 00:26:02.937 line:80%
You joined the team.
You need a project of your own.

264
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.231 line:80%
You can do it, right?

265
00:26:05.314 --> 00:26:06.732 line:80%
I want you all to help.

266
00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:13.030 line:80%
This isn't right, Mr. Yu!

267
00:26:14.115 --> 00:26:17.243 line:80%
You chose money over me.
Did you not see this coming?

268
00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:19.412 line:80%
You can't have it both ways, Ji-won.

269
00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:25.710 line:80%
Fine. I'll find a new job.

270
00:26:25.793 --> 00:26:29.088 line:80%
In return,
let me finish the meal kit project.

271
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:31.716 line:80%
This project belongs to Ms. Yang and me.

272
00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:33.301 line:80%
It belongs to the company.

273
00:26:35.136 --> 00:26:37.054 line:80%
Don't let personal matters--

274
00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:40.933 line:80%
I gave you the meal kit project
because of my personal feelings.

275
00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:44.061 line:80%
I don't want to see you. Take the day off.

276
00:26:45.021 --> 00:26:46.647 line:80%
Resigning would be better.

277
00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:06.584 line:80%
She took the money and broke up with him?

278
00:27:15.468 --> 00:27:18.429 line:80%
OH YU-RA

279
00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:22.975 line:80%
Forget it.

280
00:27:39.867 --> 00:27:41.702 line:80%
Why are you doing this alone?

281
00:27:43.037 --> 00:27:44.163 line:80%
What?

282
00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:47.500 line:80%
My position turned to crap
because of someone.

283
00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:49.835 line:80%
As I said before,

284
00:27:51.087 --> 00:27:54.715 line:80%
none of this would've happened
if you didn't see Su-min.

285
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.635 line:80%
Don't be ridiculous.

286
00:27:57.718 --> 00:28:00.388 line:80%
You screwed me over to switch to Mr. Yu.

287
00:28:07.436 --> 00:28:08.479 line:80%
You're right.

288
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:11.649 line:80%
I am?

289
00:28:13.109 --> 00:28:16.153 line:80%
But the situation has changed.

290
00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:29.083 line:80%
Do you want to have a drink with me later?

291
00:28:32.002 --> 00:28:33.045 line:80%
Eighty billion won?

292
00:28:37.675 --> 00:28:42.430 line:80%
The chairman said he'd gladly pay me
that much if I broke up with him.

293
00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:46.308 line:80%
Of course, it's not all cash.

294
00:28:46.392 --> 00:28:47.935 line:80%
There's real estate too.

295
00:28:50.688 --> 00:28:52.773 line:80%
He took care of all the taxes too.

296
00:28:53.357 --> 00:28:55.734 line:80%
So I don't even know how much I have.

297
00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:58.904 line:80%
An asset manager? I have that too.

298
00:29:01.866 --> 00:29:06.871 line:80%
Mr. Yu is pretty angry with me
for taking money from the chairman.

299
00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:09.039 line:80%
But what else was I supposed to do?

300
00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:15.588 line:80%
It makes sense.

301
00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:19.842 line:80%
No matter how rich he is, it'd be strange
to just give her that much.

302
00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:23.471 line:80%
But if it's under the condition
that she stops seeing him,

303
00:29:23.554 --> 00:29:24.889 line:80%
that makes more sense.

304
00:29:26.474 --> 00:29:28.350 line:80%
Still, that's a lot...

305
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:34.440 line:80%
JEONG SU-MIN, JI-WON'S FRIEND

306
00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:36.317 line:80%
Why does she have to call now?

307
00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:51.999 line:80%
MIN-HWAN

308
00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:00.090 line:80%
What is it?

309
00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:11.435 line:80%
Shouldn't you be at home at this hour?

310
00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:20.069 line:80%
I know you're busy.
Thanks for making time for me.

311
00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:23.697 line:80%
I've wanted to see you.

312
00:30:25.282 --> 00:30:28.327 line:80%
When I saw you last time,

313
00:30:29.328 --> 00:30:31.664 line:80%
I was reminded of working together.

314
00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:45.052 line:80%
Bye, Su-min.

315
00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:46.887 line:80%
I loved you.

316
00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:50.808 line:80%
I die today.

317
00:30:55.479 --> 00:30:57.982 line:80%
You seem different
now that you're married.

318
00:31:00.276 --> 00:31:04.238 line:80%
Women act like they won't change,
but they change after marriage.

319
00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:07.366 line:80%
Ji-won, who's not married, gets prettier.

320
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:09.952 line:80%
Jeong Su-min.

321
00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:12.121 line:80%
You should be alert.

322
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.081 line:80%
Min-hwan and Ji-won...

323
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:18.294 line:80%
They dated for seven years
since they're a good fit.

324
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:21.422 line:80%
Besides, they see each other often
at work.

325
00:31:21.505 --> 00:31:23.716 line:80%
Old feelings could come back, and...

326
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:41.984 line:80%
Do you remember
the all-you-can-eat restaurant

327
00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:44.153 line:80%
near my old place?

328
00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:45.654 line:80%
We went there often.

329
00:31:46.322 --> 00:31:47.323 line:80%
Yeah.

330
00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:52.620 line:80%
On days we went there,
you wouldn't let me eat breakfast

331
00:31:52.703 --> 00:31:55.748 line:80%
or drink water in case I'd feel full.

332
00:31:55.831 --> 00:31:58.917 line:80%
Why would you remember
something so pathetic?

333
00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:02.379 line:80%
Why is that pathetic? It's cute.

334
00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:07.885 line:80%
Back then, everything felt
precious and priceless.

335
00:32:11.764 --> 00:32:15.351 line:80%
Money wasn't that important to me
when I was with you.

336
00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:19.146 line:80%
You know I really liked you.

337
00:32:20.064 --> 00:32:23.192 line:80%
Well, there was no one like you.

338
00:32:24.318 --> 00:32:26.028 line:80%
You could put up with me too.

339
00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:33.452 line:80%
So...

340
00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:36.747 line:80%
you and Yu Ji-hyuk really broke up?

341
00:32:38.832 --> 00:32:40.250 line:80%
I thought so, but...

342
00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:46.924 line:80%
Actually, I almost had
a big accident recently.

343
00:32:48.384 --> 00:32:49.843 line:80%
Accident?

344
00:32:51.387 --> 00:32:55.391 line:80%
It was with a dump truck,
so I would've died.

345
00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:58.018 line:80%
But Mr. Yu came out of nowhere and...

346
00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:01.814 line:80%
Everything got complicated then.

347
00:33:03.941 --> 00:33:04.983 line:80%
Complicated?

348
00:33:05.067 --> 00:33:07.820 line:80%
Yes, horribly complicated.

349
00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:16.161 line:80%
Do you know
who the driver of that truck was?

350
00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:23.252 line:80%
No, how would I know that?

351
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:25.796 line:80%
It was Su-min's dad.

352
00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:30.759 line:80%
She knew everything.

353
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.938 line:80%
Stop lying.

354
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:44.982 line:80%
You keep lying and lying!

355
00:33:45.816 --> 00:33:46.942 line:80%
I want to.

356
00:33:49.278 --> 00:33:51.196 line:80%
I want to stop it too.

357
00:33:57.244 --> 00:34:00.956 line:80%
Where are you?
Shouldn't you tell me what's going on?

358
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.584 line:80%
I'm going crazy stuck at home.

359
00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:06.211 line:80%
Why won't you come home?

360
00:34:06.295 --> 00:34:08.005 line:80%
Are you with Kang Ji-won...

361
00:34:14.887 --> 00:34:17.264 line:80%
They dated for seven years
since they're a good fit.

362
00:34:20.184 --> 00:34:21.769 line:80%
No.

363
00:34:21.852 --> 00:34:23.520 line:80%
No way.

364
00:34:23.604 --> 00:34:25.731 line:80%
He wanted to kill her...

365
00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:26.899 line:80%
What's going on? Move!

366
00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:29.276 line:80%
Are you really my girlfriend?

367
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:30.360 line:80%
Avocado!

368
00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:32.362 line:80%
Kang Ji-won.

369
00:34:33.614 --> 00:34:34.948 line:80%
I love you.

370
00:34:41.538 --> 00:34:44.374 line:80%
You didn't know she'd stoop so low,
did you?

371
00:34:45.042 --> 00:34:46.210 line:80%
I didn't either.

372
00:34:47.461 --> 00:34:50.798 line:80%
I get she hates me,
but how could she try to kill me?

373
00:34:50.881 --> 00:34:52.341 line:80%
She's crazy.

374
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.804 line:80%
I didn't just see her true colors
with this accident.

375
00:34:57.304 --> 00:34:58.472 line:80%
Mr. Yu...

376
00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:00.682 line:80%
put someone on me.

377
00:35:02.476 --> 00:35:07.314 line:80%
If not, how could he have shown up?
We hadn't met since we broke up.

378
00:35:07.397 --> 00:35:08.732 line:80%
It doesn't make sense.

379
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:13.946 line:80%
I think I'm going crazy.

380
00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:17.157 line:80%
I feel like I'm being watched.
I'm so scared.

381
00:35:19.326 --> 00:35:21.578 line:80%
What do I do in this situation?

382
00:35:21.662 --> 00:35:25.582 line:80%
So you haven't come to work because...

383
00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:29.294 line:80%
It was because of me.
I couldn't just leave him.

384
00:35:30.337 --> 00:35:33.131 line:80%
Fortunately, he wasn't hurt that badly.

385
00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:36.468 line:80%
So he's been discharged.

386
00:35:38.178 --> 00:35:40.889 line:80%
But when I told him we were through,

387
00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:43.392 line:80%
he told me to resign.

388
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.230 line:80%
She's telling the truth.

389
00:35:57.614 --> 00:35:59.741 line:80%
Something felt off, and this was it.

390
00:35:59.825 --> 00:36:03.871 line:80%
Yes, Yu Ji-hyuk is rich,
so she was right to switch over to him.

391
00:36:03.954 --> 00:36:08.667 line:80%
And she was also right
to break up with him for 80 billion won.

392
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.880 line:80%
She wouldn't make a good wife
for a rich guy.

393
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:16.842 line:80%
If she has 80 billion won,
I shouldn't kill her.

394
00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:20.762 line:80%
If she dies, her mom and the others
will split the money.

395
00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:22.681 line:80%
Nothing will come to me.

396
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:27.019 line:80%
But if I seduce her again,
that 80 billion won will come to me.

397
00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:30.856 line:80%
Can you break up with Su-min?

398
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.482 line:80%
What?

399
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:36.194 line:80%
You know how scary she is now.

400
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.280 line:80%
Come back to me.

401
00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:43.911 line:80%
I can't do this alone...

402
00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:49.541 line:80%
Never mind, I should go.

403
00:36:50.751 --> 00:36:52.085 line:80%
Ji-won.

404
00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:06.934 line:80%
I'll call you.

405
00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:31.375 line:80%
I'm sorry. I'm sure you hated to see that.

406
00:37:59.695 --> 00:38:01.029 line:80%
What are you doing?

407
00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:04.950 line:80%
Nothing.

408
00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:10.122 line:80%
If I don't do this,
I don't think I can keep sane.

409
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:18.046 line:80%
You like me a lot, don't you?

410
00:38:28.515 --> 00:38:29.891 line:80%
No, well...

411
00:38:29.975 --> 00:38:33.311 line:80%
Earlier, Min-hwan seemed
to be regretting what he did.

412
00:38:34.479 --> 00:38:35.772 line:80%
Min-hwan?

413
00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:40.694 line:80%
He's probably crunching numbers
in his head right now.

414
00:38:51.997 --> 00:38:53.790 line:80%
-Hey.
-
Are you coming today?

415
00:38:53.874 --> 00:38:55.751 line:80%
I was just about to call.

416
00:38:55.834 --> 00:38:58.462 line:80%
I think things will get easier.

417
00:38:58.545 --> 00:39:00.589 line:80%
I just met with Kang Ji-won.

418
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.758 line:80%
She has no idea I was involved.

419
00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:05.969 line:80%
So you just have to take care

420
00:39:06.053 --> 00:39:08.346 line:80%
of Ji-won's mom and Su-min's dad.

421
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.058 line:80%
Then she'll come to me
with 80 billion won.

422
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:14.895 line:80%
And you can get U&K or Yu Ji-hyuk.
Do whatever you want.

423
00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:19.274 line:80%
We'll become each other's support forever.

424
00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:24.112 line:80%
Yeah, I see.

425
00:39:24.196 --> 00:39:25.864 line:80%
That's nice and easy.

426
00:39:31.036 --> 00:39:33.872 line:80%
He underestimates his ex-girlfriend.

427
00:39:33.955 --> 00:39:35.624 line:80%
I told you, didn't I?

428
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:38.794 line:80%
Men aren't wary
of the women they've slept with.

429
00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:44.549 line:80%
Where's Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk?

430
00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:49.304 line:80%
When you were younger,

431
00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:51.765 line:80%
you looked just like that actor.

432
00:39:51.848 --> 00:39:53.475 line:80%
I looked better.

433
00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:55.519 line:80%
You were handsome.

434
00:39:57.354 --> 00:39:59.648 line:80%
What shall we do in China?

435
00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:00.857 line:80%
Let's kill them.

436
00:40:01.983 --> 00:40:02.818 line:80%
Pardon?

437
00:40:05.237 --> 00:40:07.656 line:80%
Is it because of what Min-hwan said?

438
00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:09.783 line:80%
No, nothing bad can come from it.

439
00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:13.495 line:80%
If Ji-won wants to return to Min-hwan,

440
00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:16.748 line:80%
she shouldn't find out
that he tried to kill her.

441
00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:19.209 line:80%
And even if she's up to something,

442
00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:22.295 line:80%
she can't prove anything
with those two gone.

443
00:40:23.296 --> 00:40:26.716 line:80%
Also, it's easier than stowing them away.

444
00:40:28.552 --> 00:40:29.803 line:80%
Let's get a divorce.

445
00:40:35.725 --> 00:40:37.477 line:80%
We don't have kids.

446
00:40:37.561 --> 00:40:40.188 line:80%
Honestly, I have no reason
to live with you.

447
00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:43.316 line:80%
Nothing good came from being with you.

448
00:40:45.068 --> 00:40:46.069 line:80%
Oh, right.

449
00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:49.823 line:80%
You still can't reach your dad?

450
00:40:54.703 --> 00:40:55.704 line:80%
Did you

451
00:40:57.247 --> 00:40:58.665 line:80%
meet Kang Ji-won?

452
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:05.463 line:80%
Yeah, I saw her at work.

453
00:41:06.256 --> 00:41:07.340 line:80%
Why do you ask?

454
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:12.220 line:80%
I thought about it.

455
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:16.892 line:80%
If you and Ji-won get back together...

456
00:41:24.357 --> 00:41:26.401 line:80%
then only I'll get screwed over.

457
00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:36.203 line:80%
OUT OF BUSINESS

458
00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:38.747 line:80%
What's going on?

459
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.791 line:80%
Did you get a call?

460
00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:45.086 line:80%
He wouldn't do something like this.

461
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.963 line:80%
He could've told us.

462
00:41:47.047 --> 00:41:49.382 line:80%
Are we fired? What's going on?

463
00:41:50.926 --> 00:41:53.803 line:80%
Eun-ho, I'm sorry.

464
00:41:53.887 --> 00:41:57.015 line:80%
I had to close Werther
for personal reasons.

465
00:41:57.098 --> 00:42:01.269 line:80%
It's been great working with you.
I hope we meet again one day.

466
00:42:02.771 --> 00:42:04.439 line:80%
He closed Werther?

467
00:42:05.148 --> 00:42:05.982 line:80%
Suddenly?

468
00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:08.068 line:80%
-This is insane.
-What the hell?

469
00:42:11.446 --> 00:42:12.364 line:80%
Everyone,

470
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:16.743 line:80%
I had to close Werther.
Your severance pay has been wired.

471
00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:18.495 line:80%
-Closed?
-
I'm sorry.

472
00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:19.579 line:80%
What did you get?

473
00:42:19.663 --> 00:42:21.456 line:80%
He'll pay a month's salary...

474
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:22.666 line:80%
We're unemployed.

475
00:42:22.749 --> 00:42:24.751 line:80%
What's going on?

476
00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.753 line:80%
How did this happen?

477
00:42:26.836 --> 00:42:28.296 line:80%
Someone's coming.

478
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:31.925 line:80%
Why were they in there?

479
00:42:40.976 --> 00:42:42.936 line:80%
Chef? Come on in.

480
00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:51.278 line:80%
Double the pay.

481
00:42:52.529 --> 00:42:54.281 line:80%
Your boss here suddenly

482
00:42:54.364 --> 00:42:57.325 line:80%
decided to sell me the restaurant

483
00:42:57.993 --> 00:43:00.161 line:80%
at double the market price.

484
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.915 line:80%
It was a good choice.

485
00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:07.502 line:80%
It's a choice you can make too.

486
00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:10.755 line:80%
If you help me, this expensive restaurant

487
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:12.716 line:80%
will become yours.

488
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:21.224 line:80%
What do I have to do?

489
00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:24.311 line:80%
You have two choices.

490
00:43:25.186 --> 00:43:27.981 line:80%
One, take the restaurant.

491
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:31.985 line:80%
Two, lose your job.

492
00:43:38.867 --> 00:43:40.035 line:80%
Chef!

493
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:42.996 line:80%
My heart fluttered when you contacted me!

494
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.292 line:80%
When Ji-won turned me down,

495
00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:51.421 line:80%
it was nice to get comforted by you.

496
00:43:54.007 --> 00:43:56.176 line:80%
Is something wrong?

497
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.347 line:80%
I'm unemployed now.

498
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:02.849 line:80%
Why?

499
00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:08.813 line:80%
Just because.

500
00:44:11.232 --> 00:44:12.817 line:80%
Come on!

501
00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:16.196 line:80%
Still, you're famous and handsome...

502
00:44:16.279 --> 00:44:18.948 line:80%
Most importantly,
your food tastes so good!

503
00:44:19.032 --> 00:44:20.492 line:80%
So...

504
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:23.078 line:80%
you may be unemployed for a second,

505
00:44:23.161 --> 00:44:25.205 line:80%
-but you--
-This industry's small.

506
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.166 line:80%
The restaurant suddenly closed.

507
00:44:28.249 --> 00:44:30.293 line:80%
So all the gossipers will

508
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.337 line:80%
talk about me.

509
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.174 line:80%
I know that. It's the same with me.

510
00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:41.096 line:80%
People don't believe us
without even trying to know the story.

511
00:44:42.263 --> 00:44:45.100 line:80%
If only a decent chef appeared...

512
00:45:01.408 --> 00:45:02.659 line:80%
Ms. Kang.

513
00:45:05.245 --> 00:45:07.247 line:80%
-Hey!
-Hey.

514
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.457 line:80%
Why didn't I think of you?

515
00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:13.795 line:80%
But I don't know if I can be of any help.

516
00:45:14.462 --> 00:45:16.214 line:80%
What are you talking about?

517
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.804 line:80%
Can we talk privately for a second?

518
00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:26.266 line:80%
-Sure.
-Let's go.

519
00:45:30.103 --> 00:45:33.690 line:80%
So it was a woman?

520
00:45:33.773 --> 00:45:34.607 line:80%
Yeah.

521
00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:43.450 line:80%
Thanks for telling me.

522
00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:46.703 line:80%
And I'm so sorry. No harm will go to you.

523
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.373 line:80%
That's not why I told you.

524
00:45:57.172 --> 00:46:01.009 line:80%
Anyway, I didn't tell Hui-yeon.

525
00:46:04.012 --> 00:46:08.266 line:80%
Oh Yu-ra bought Werther
and asked Eun-ho to help her.

526
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:10.185 line:80%
He said no, and she fired him.

527
00:46:10.727 --> 00:46:13.813 line:80%
And she didn't tell him
what she needed help with.

528
00:46:15.023 --> 00:46:17.025 line:80%
I know what it is. Don't worry.

529
00:46:18.193 --> 00:46:21.738 line:80%
I'll call you back later.
I'm with someone right now.

530
00:46:38.004 --> 00:46:39.923 line:80%
You have two choices.

531
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:43.760 line:80%
One, help me.

532
00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:46.804 line:80%
Two, go down with Oh Yu-ra.

533
00:46:49.557 --> 00:46:52.769 line:80%
I'm sure you know which to choose
if you're not a fool.

534
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:02.487 line:80%
What do I have to do?

535
00:47:13.748 --> 00:47:16.167 line:80%
This is Kang Ji-won, Marketing Team 1.

536
00:47:16.251 --> 00:47:19.546 line:80%
Hello, this is Park Min-hwan
from U&K Marketing Team 3.

537
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.513 line:80%
I was wondering
if you could meet me tonight.

538
00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:31.516 line:80%
For the mistakes I've made,

539
00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:33.017 line:80%
I want to treat you.

540
00:47:34.978 --> 00:47:37.564 line:80%
I'd be grateful.

541
00:47:37.647 --> 00:47:40.567 line:80%
I'm always ready.

542
00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:44.445 line:80%
I hope it marks a new beginning.
You can look forward to it.

543
00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:49.701 line:80%
Okay.

544
00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:51.661 line:80%
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

545
00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:53.121 line:80%
-Just a moment.
-Sure.

546
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.374 line:80%
Yes?

547
00:47:56.457 --> 00:47:58.543 line:80%
Park Min-hwan already has a woman.

548
00:48:00.753 --> 00:48:01.796 line:80%
What?

549
00:48:03.548 --> 00:48:05.383 line:80%
You said you couldn't get them!

550
00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:08.052 line:80%
You seemed down, so I asked around.

551
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:15.727 line:80%
So I sent limited-edition red high heels.

552
00:48:18.938 --> 00:48:21.232 line:80%
Along with the candy tin you spoke of.

553
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:24.527 line:80%
What's this?

554
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:28.239 line:80%
Someone brought it today.
Shall I get rid of it?

555
00:48:34.454 --> 00:48:37.832 line:80%
No, just leave it.
It reminds me of the old days.

556
00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:45.798 line:80%
Then I don't need to play
with Min-hwan anymore.

557
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:53.973 line:80%
Thanks for waiting.

558
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:57.060 line:80%
But I don't think I can do dinner.

559
00:48:58.061 --> 00:49:00.605 line:80%
If it's because of work, it can be helped.

560
00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:03.149 line:80%
I'm free tomorrow too.

561
00:49:03.232 --> 00:49:05.109 line:80%
I'm even free on the weekends.

562
00:49:05.693 --> 00:49:07.945 line:80%
I'm meeting with you after all.

563
00:49:08.029 --> 00:49:09.113 line:80%
I'm free whenever.

564
00:49:09.197 --> 00:49:10.615 line:80%
No.

565
00:49:10.698 --> 00:49:12.200 line:80%
What I mean is...

566
00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:15.912 line:80%
I'll never do business with you.

567
00:49:18.998 --> 00:49:20.083 line:80%
What?

568
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:23.544 line:80%
The only thing you know
how to do is sugarcoat things.

569
00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:27.090 line:80%
You ruin everything you touch,
and aim for insurance fraud.

570
00:49:27.173 --> 00:49:29.300 line:80%
You're too incompetent to work with.

571
00:49:29.384 --> 00:49:32.303 line:80%
What really surprised me
is your HR method.

572
00:49:32.887 --> 00:49:36.307 line:80%
You especially excel
at recruiting female talent.

573
00:49:36.391 --> 00:49:39.018 line:80%
I was surprised,
since you just got married.

574
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:41.688 line:80%
You're amazing in many ways.

575
00:49:44.941 --> 00:49:47.068 line:80%
Good luck in the future.

576
00:49:54.867 --> 00:49:56.869 line:80%
What client is such a scumbag?

577
00:50:17.724 --> 00:50:20.977 line:80%
JI-WON. I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF...

578
00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:32.447 line:80%
What are you waiting for?
Shall I light the fire?

579
00:50:48.838 --> 00:50:51.090 line:80%
It's my first time seeing someone die.

580
00:50:56.012 --> 00:50:57.638 line:80%
But it's boring.

581
00:50:59.474 --> 00:51:02.477 line:80%
Still, I feel better.

582
00:51:11.861 --> 00:51:14.238 line:80%
I don't think I fit in Korea.

583
00:51:14.322 --> 00:51:15.865 line:80%
Nothing goes right here.

584
00:51:17.283 --> 00:51:21.370 line:80%
Right. About that restaurant,
what do I do with that?

585
00:51:21.454 --> 00:51:23.206 line:80%
Shall I tear it down?

586
00:51:31.214 --> 00:51:33.883 line:80%
Okay, fine. Let's divorce.

587
00:51:45.937 --> 00:51:47.647 line:80%
OH

588
00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.524 line:80%
CALL

589
00:51:49.607 --> 00:51:51.192 line:80%
OH

590
00:51:54.237 --> 00:51:56.572 line:80%
Hello, this is Oh Yu-ra.

591
00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:59.867 line:80%
Hello, my name's Jeong Su-min.

592
00:52:14.799 --> 00:52:15.925 line:80%
There.

593
00:52:16.509 --> 00:52:17.885 line:80%
It fits perfectly.

594
00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:22.223 line:80%
Why is everything working out so well?

595
00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:33.609 line:80%
I'll be there in five minutes.
Finish up and come down.

596
00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:50.126 line:80%
Yes, this is Kang Ji-won
of Marketing Team 1.

597
00:52:53.462 --> 00:52:54.630 line:80%
Hello?

598
00:53:06.851 --> 00:53:07.935 line:80%
Who are you?

599
00:53:24.452 --> 00:53:25.536 line:80%
Who are you?

600
00:53:32.877 --> 00:53:35.212 line:80%
Why would you suddenly call here?

601
00:53:35.296 --> 00:53:37.840 line:80%
I'm sorry. You didn't pick up your phone.

602
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.886 line:80%
It's in my purse. I didn't know. Sorry.

603
00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:44.305 line:80%
I'll get there in about 15 minutes.

604
00:53:44.388 --> 00:53:45.431 line:80%
Okay.

605
00:54:36.649 --> 00:54:37.650 line:80%
Kang Ji-won.

606
00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:51.122 line:80%
Ji-won.

607
00:54:57.003 --> 00:54:58.004 line:80%
Are you scared?

608
00:54:59.964 --> 00:55:01.674 line:80%
We need to talk.

609
00:55:02.967 --> 00:55:03.968 line:80%
Come out.

610
00:55:05.386 --> 00:55:06.512 line:80%
Let's talk.

611
00:55:08.222 --> 00:55:09.098 line:80%
Well?

612
00:55:11.183 --> 00:55:12.852 line:80%
We have a lot to talk about.

613
00:55:28.617 --> 00:55:31.328 line:80%
You should've known your place.

614
00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:34.540 line:80%
This is the problem with women.

615
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:40.463 line:80%
Was it fun messing with me?

616
00:56:07.823 --> 00:56:10.242 line:80%
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

617
00:56:10.826 --> 00:56:12.244 line:80%
Hey, Ji-hyuk's calling.

618
00:56:14.413 --> 00:56:15.706 line:80%
Will you not pick up?

619
00:56:18.834 --> 00:56:20.086 line:80%
Then I'll pick it up.

620
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:25.591 line:80%
Damn it...

621
00:56:27.176 --> 00:56:28.344 line:80%
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

622
00:56:32.807 --> 00:56:34.934 line:80%
You've got a strong stomach.

623
00:56:37.144 --> 00:56:38.854 line:80%
I like money.

624
00:56:39.355 --> 00:56:43.609 line:80%
But aren't those rich people disgusting?

625
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:46.237 line:80%
They disgust me.

626
00:56:59.792 --> 00:57:00.918 line:80%
What are you doing?

627
00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:17.518 line:80%
How dare you mess with me?

628
00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:19.103 line:80%
Let go of me! Let go!

629
00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:21.355 line:80%
What? Are you scared?

630
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:23.566 line:80%
Why did you make a mockery of me?

631
00:57:25.067 --> 00:57:26.735 line:80%
Ji-won.

632
00:57:26.819 --> 00:57:30.823 line:80%
I really wanted to go back to you.
I wanted to try hard this time!

633
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.950 line:80%
You tried to kill me.

634
00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:37.163 line:80%
You...

635
00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:39.832 line:80%
tricked me.

636
00:57:39.915 --> 00:57:42.168 line:80%
You treated me like crap!

637
00:57:43.252 --> 00:57:46.422 line:80%
You can kill others,
but your life's that precious?

638
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:50.926 line:80%
I thought about how to pay you back.

639
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:55.014 line:80%
I could just give Su-min to you,
but how do I send you to hell?

640
00:57:56.849 --> 00:57:57.850 line:80%
What?

641
00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:00.060 line:80%
Hell?

642
00:58:01.645 --> 00:58:03.230 line:80%
Do you want to die?

643
00:58:07.985 --> 00:58:09.320 line:80%
This was it.

644
00:58:10.446 --> 00:58:11.655 line:80%
Kill me.

645
00:58:12.531 --> 00:58:14.700 line:80%
But kill me for sure this time.

646
00:58:14.783 --> 00:58:17.036 line:80%
Or I'll kill you.

647
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.382 line:80%
Die.

648
00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:33.344 line:80%
You want me to kill you, so I will.

649
00:58:35.304 --> 00:58:36.305 line:80%
Are you laughing?

650
00:58:37.139 --> 00:58:38.140 line:80%
Just die.

651
00:58:40.226 --> 00:58:41.602 line:80%
Kill me.

652
00:59:19.265 --> 00:59:20.891 line:80%
Ji-won, are you okay?

653
00:59:20.975 --> 00:59:22.643 line:80%
Ji-won, wake up.

654
00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:23.769 line:80%
Ji-won.

655
00:59:23.852 --> 00:59:25.354 line:80%
Ji-won, wake up.

656
00:59:26.272 --> 00:59:27.439 line:80%
Ji-won!

657
00:59:34.613 --> 00:59:36.365 line:80%
You disgusting bastard.

658
00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:45.416 line:80%
Was I destined to die
in Park Min-hwan's hands?

659
01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.443 line:80%
Ji-won!

660
01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.778 line:80%
You can't do this
because you fight better.

661
01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:17.072 line:80%
I hate using my strength.

662
01:00:17.156 --> 01:00:18.574 line:80%
But not to you.

663
01:00:20.034 --> 01:00:23.120 line:80%
-Ji-hyuk.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.

664
01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.872 line:80%
Did you try to kill Ji-won?

665
01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:28.917 line:80%
Why is everyone looking for Kang Ji-won?

666
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.711 line:80%
I'll try to move Min-hwan.

667
01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.964 line:80%
I'll take care of Su-min
so she won't bother you.

668
01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:38.177 line:80%
If Su-min disappears,
there won't be anyone to threaten you.

669
01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.846 line:80%
I have to take care of you to start over.
