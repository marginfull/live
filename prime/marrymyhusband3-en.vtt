All right.

00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:43.002 line:80%
Don't move.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.172 line:80%
Heave...

4
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:48.466 line:80%
ho!

5
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.302 line:80%
It's a delivery!

6
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.765 line:80%
Who...

7
00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:56.682 line:80%
FRY ME

8
00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:59.101 line:80%
Hi! Did you order hot fried chicken,

9
00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:00.269 line:80%
spicy chicken,

10
00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.104 line:80%
and salty soy sauce chicken?

11
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.315 line:80%
No.

12
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:05.733 line:80%
Did you order chicken?

13
00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:07.485 line:80%
How could I?

14
00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:08.694 line:80%
Come. Let's start over.

15
00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:09.987 line:80%
I got it wrong.

16
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.491 line:80%
You got fried, spicy,
and soy sauce chicken.

17
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.285 line:80%
And the large fries
and cola are on the house.

18
00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:19.747 line:80%
-I'm sorry, but--
-Mister.

19
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.916 line:80%
We didn't order it. Okay? Just go.

20
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.335 line:80%
Just a second.

21
00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:27.004 line:80%
Was it a cider, not cola?

22
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.840 line:80%
Mister, we didn't order anything.

23
00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:31.509 line:80%
So just go.

24
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:33.552 line:80%
You didn't order chicken?

25
00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:35.888 line:80%
But this is the address. Apartment 401.

26
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.515 line:80%
I don't care. Just go.

27
00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:39.725 line:80%
I have to check first.

28
00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:40.851 line:80%
What's with you?

29
00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.395 line:80%
You're really pissing me off.

30
00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:45.981 line:80%
What do you want to do? Well?

31
00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:50.569 line:80%
I'm sure this is it.

32
00:01:50.653 --> 00:01:52.655 line:80%
I'll check, so just wait here.

33
00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:57.159 line:80%
Don't check, and don't come back!

34
00:01:57.243 --> 00:01:59.829 line:80%
-I'll be right back.
-Don't come back!

35
00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:01.205 line:80%
Go! Hey!

36
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.498 line:80%
Wait...

37
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.502 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won. Hey!

38
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.631 line:80%
What the heck?

39
00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:15.761 line:80%
Ji-won? Open the door.

40
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.557 line:80%
I don't think we should be doing this.

41
00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:24.144 line:80%
What? What are you talking about? Hey!

42
00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:28.023 line:80%
I'm not the delivery man!
It's me. Open the door!

43
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.528 line:80%
Come on. Hey!

44
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.701 line:80%
I'm flustered by how you're acting.

45
00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:41.120 line:80%
What do you think of our relationship?

46
00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.290 line:80%
What is she talking about?

47
00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:46.542 line:80%
Are you sick or something?

48
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.878 line:80%
This isn't like you. Hey!

49
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:50.963 line:80%
Open the door. What's with you?

50
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.384 line:80%
I think I need some time.
Tell me if it's hard for you.

51
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.553 line:80%
I'll accept whatever you say.

52
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:02.433 line:80%
Is she kidding?

53
00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:20.034 line:80%
I'm leaving! You're being so mean.

54
00:03:44.183 --> 00:03:45.434 line:80%
Ji-won?

55
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:47.519 line:80%
You can hear me, right?

56
00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:51.774 line:80%
I don't think you're easy.

57
00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.110 line:80%
I love your soul more.

58
00:03:56.904 --> 00:04:00.199 line:80%
Honestly, you're all skin and bones.
There's nothing to see.

59
00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:03.994 line:80%
Don't get me wrong.

60
00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:05.829 line:80%
Anyway...

61
00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:08.832 line:80%
Sorry about tonight.

62
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.460 line:80%
Good night.

63
00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:30.354 line:80%
That could've been bad.

64
00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.025 line:80%
This little...

65
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:43.909 line:80%
Damn it.

66
00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:54.837 line:80%
Goodness.

67
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.715 line:80%
I was going to go back up
if he didn't come out.

68
00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:00.634 line:80%
Did I do a good job?

69
00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:02.344 line:80%
Yeah. Good job.

70
00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:04.221 line:80%
I felt like a spy. It was fun.

71
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.265 line:80%
But what's going on?

72
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.147 line:80%
So...

73
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.148 line:80%
Shall I go now?

74
00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.197 line:80%
EPISODE 3

75
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:26.618 line:80%
Hey!

76
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:28.328 line:80%
I swear...

77
00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:30.539 line:80%
Where'd you go with all the chicken?

78
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.375 line:80%
I had to do all the works alone until now!

79
00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:35.335 line:80%
Ji-hyuk urgently needed me.

80
00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.337 line:80%
You little...

81
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:39.631 line:80%
Well...

82
00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:40.674 line:80%
Come on. Try me.

83
00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:42.634 line:80%
-You should've been faster!
-Do it!

84
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:44.970 line:80%
-Try it!
-I thought you ran away.

85
00:05:45.054 --> 00:05:46.055 line:80%
Why you...

86
00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.099 line:80%
But why, all of a sudden?

87
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.101 line:80%
I don't know.

88
00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:53.562 line:80%
He asked me to fake a misdelivery.

89
00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.399 line:80%
I think something's going on.

90
00:05:57.483 --> 00:05:58.484 line:80%
What do you mean?

91
00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:01.361 line:80%
This morning,
he suddenly asked me to find someone,

92
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:02.946 line:80%
so I made over 100 calls.

93
00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:05.032 line:80%
-To find someone?
-Yeah.

94
00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.242 line:80%
-Why?
-I don't know.

95
00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:09.870 line:80%
He had this look on his face.

96
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.791 line:80%
So I couldn't ask.

97
00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:32.684 line:80%
You should've been a celebrity instead.

98
00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:35.104 line:80%
I'm not good in front of people.

99
00:06:35.187 --> 00:06:37.397 line:80%
That's your problem.

100
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:38.649 line:80%
You're too timid...

101
00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:41.026 line:80%
I mean, scrupulous.

102
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.696 line:80%
We could've been huge
if you were a little shameless.

103
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.740 line:80%
If you appear on TV and do...

104
00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:48.242 line:80%
a little of this

105
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:49.576 line:80%
and a little of that,

106
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.704 line:80%
our sales would be through the roof!

107
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.290 line:80%
I almost forgot.

108
00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:59.169 line:80%
I can't come in this Sunday.
I already told the sous-chef.

109
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.088 line:80%
What's up? Do you have a blind date?

110
00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.800 line:80%
Are you ready to start dating now?

111
00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.802 line:80%
No, it's not that.

112
00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.638 line:80%
I have a high school reunion.

113
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.973 line:80%
What?

114
00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:12.933 line:80%
You're going?

115
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:17.396 line:80%
Don't you avoid these events
since your first love broke your heart?

116
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.565 line:80%
She turned you down harshly, right?

117
00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:24.695 line:80%
You're not the type
to be turned down that easily.

118
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.196 line:80%
Come on.

119
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.575 line:80%
By the way,
how did you know about the reunion?

120
00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.035 line:80%
You don't keep in touch.

121
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.413 line:80%
Well...

By any chance,

124
00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:48.594 line:80%
are you free this Sunday?

125
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.438 line:80%
You seem like a decent person,

126
00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.356 line:80%
but I have a girlfriend.

127
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.275 line:80%
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me?

128
00:08:04.026 --> 00:08:06.904 line:80%
That's not what I mean.
What are you thinking?

129
00:08:07.613 --> 00:08:09.323 line:80%
It's not like that. Never.

130
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:14.786 line:80%
There's a high school reunion.

131
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:17.915 line:80%
A man showed up and told me about it.

132
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.834 line:80%
But I don't know who he is.

133
00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:23.420 line:80%
He's not from my school.

134
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.173 line:80%
That sounds suspicious.

135
00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.717 line:80%
It's best not to get involved.

136
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.720 line:80%
Unless you want to see your first love,
don't go.

137
00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.725 line:80%
What did I do?

138
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:39.937 line:80%
You shouldn't be like that.

139
00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.691 line:80%
I never want to speak to you again.

140
00:08:45.943 --> 00:08:47.486 line:80%
Do you miss her?

141
00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:51.490 line:80%
Since that traumatic event,
you didn't want to date anyone.

142
00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:53.533 line:80%
You even wear the fake ring around.

143
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:58.247 line:80%
Right? I shouldn't go, should I?

144
00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.126 line:80%
If you're going to go,

145
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.544 line:80%
dress to the nines.

146
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.075 line:80%
No.

147
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.856 line:80%
To be honest, I was really upset today.

148
00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:09.109 line:80%
You'll pay the price for it
on Sunday at Goseuljung.

149
00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.235 line:80%
Don't be late.

150
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.739 line:80%
I can't make myself pretty overnight.

151
00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:25.751 line:80%
SUNDAY

152
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:36.720 line:80%
My other half, are you coming?
Our date's today!

153
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.223 line:80%
Don't be late. Make yourself pretty!

154
00:10:42.184 --> 00:10:44.853 line:80%
I don't know
how pretty you can get overnight,

155
00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.023 line:80%

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:33.443 line:80%
Since you got the job at the big company,
your vibe feels a bit changed.

167
00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:35.737 line:80%
You feel like a classy city lady now.

168
00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.532 line:80%
I got lucky.

169
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.575 line:80%
Ji-won supported me a lot.

170
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.953 line:80%
Do you still see her?

171
00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.081 line:80%
She's my other half.

172
00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:49.459 line:80%
You're too soft. You're still a pushover.

173
00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:50.961 line:80%
What's she up to?

174
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.338 line:80%
Does she still sponge off of you?

175
00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:54.840 line:80%
She's modest.

176
00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.008 line:80%
Still, she's gotten a lot prettier.

177
00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:59.511 line:80%
She's coming later actually. I called her.

178
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.305 line:80%
Wait, she's coming here?

179
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:05.475 line:80%
Be nice to her when she shows up.

180
00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.437 line:80%
She's going through a hard time.

181
00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:09.813 line:80%
Why is that?

182
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:17.946 line:80%
Remember how I put in a referral
and got her a contract job at U&K?

183
00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.615 line:80%
Now, she has a crush on Mr. Park Min-hwan.

184
00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.076 line:80%
Park Min-hwan?
Isn't he the one you're into?

185
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.619 line:80%
Is he the same person?

186
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.206 line:80%
What?

187
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.334 line:80%
Well...

188
00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.088 line:80%
No. It's not what you think.

189
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.258 line:80%
Don't bring it up to her.

190
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.218 line:80%
-Please, don't.
-Why not?

191
00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.097 line:80%
She's at it again!

192
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:46.975 line:80%
OTHER HALF

193
00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.021 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won.

194
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.606 line:80%
Hey, where are you?

195
00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.615 line:80%
I'll get you if you can't find your way.

196
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.626 line:80%
I'm here. I'm behind you.

197
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:25.430 line:80%
Ji-won...

198
00:13:25.514 --> 00:13:26.765 line:80%
What's going on?

199
00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.558 line:80%
It wasn't just us for dinner?

200
00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:33.980 line:80%
It's been a long time.

201
00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.998 line:80%
I can't make myself pretty overnight.

202
00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:02.968 line:80%
Ms. Kang!

203
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.345 line:80%
You said you had plans on Sunday,

204
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.305 line:80%
so how about we hang out tomorrow?

205
00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.233 line:80%
SATURDAY

206
00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:26.700 line:80%
STOCK BALANCE: 1,403,000 WON

207
00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.952 line:80%
It went up to 1.4 million won.

208
00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:32.706 line:80%
I invested 3 million,
so this means it's 6 million now.

209
00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:35.959 line:80%
Once my next paycheck comes in,

210
00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.419 line:80%
I'll invest it all.

211
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.451 line:80%
What the heck?

212
00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.954 line:80%
It's a lot more different than I thought.

213
00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:23.715 line:80%
That's why the general manager
told me to not wear it.

214
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:26.843 line:80%
I'm such a fool.

215
00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:40.899 line:80%
So pretty.

216
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.574 line:80%
Ji-won!

217
00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.871 line:80%
Sorry I'm late!

218
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.122 line:80%
No, it's fine.

219
00:15:56.706 --> 00:16:01.169 line:80%
You look so pretty today!
You wore the clothes I bought you.

220
00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.339 line:80%
For today, ta-da!

221
00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.549 line:80%
Matching hats.

222
00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:12.555 line:80%
Here's yours.

223
00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.017 line:80%
It looks so great on you!

224
00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:17.560 line:80%
Thanks.

225
00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.814 line:80%
I wish glasses looked good on me too.

226
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.401 line:80%
You'd look prettier without them.

227
00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:29.030 line:80%
Again with your lack of confidence.
You're pretty! So pretty!

228
00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:31.616 line:80%
Where's Min-hwan?

229
00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:33.868 line:80%
He'll be here soon.

230
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:39.541 line:80%
The weather's great today. It's hot.

231
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.043 line:80%
Give me the candy.

232
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.468 line:80%
Sorry. I forgot to buy some more
since we finished it.

233
00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:56.224 line:80%
What? You know how much I like that candy.

234
00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:00.103 line:80%
Sorry.

235
00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:05.358 line:80%
What's up? Did Ji-won upset Su-min again?

236
00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:10.280 line:80%
Hi, Min-hwan.
She doesn't have my favorite candy today.

237
00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:13.366 line:80%
If she cared about me,
she would've prepared them.

238
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.617 line:80%
I'm so upset.

239
00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.829 line:80%
Why did you do that?

240
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.332 line:80%
That's why I bought some!

241
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.460 line:80%
My favorite!

242
00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:26.171 line:80%
-You're the best!
-Great job!

243
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:30.759 line:80%
-Shall we go see the flowers?
-Sounds good! Bring our stuff!

244
00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:35.346 line:80%
-Hurry up!
-Okay.

245
00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:39.684 line:80%
Wait!

246
00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.483 line:80%
Wow, it's so pretty.

247
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.402 line:80%
-Did you get it?
-Yeah.

248
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.781 line:80%
-Look over there. Isn't it pretty?
-Yeah.

249
00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:58.745 line:80%
My long-awaited date with you!

250
00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:00.580 line:80%
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

251
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.333 line:80%
No, that's okay.

252
00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:07.003 line:80%
Authentique...

253
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:13.343 line:80%
Su-min gave it to me as a gift.

254
00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.969 line:80%
But this one's a knockoff.

255
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.679 line:80%
I just learned that.

256
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.562 line:80%
These are real, right?

257
00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.272 line:80%
Yes, they're real.

258
00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.276 line:80%
The shine's different, right?

259
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.111 line:80%
They're beautiful.

260
00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:34.197 line:80%
Thank you. They're pretty, right?

261
00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:41.204 line:80%
Why haven't you been drinking?

262
00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.164 line:80%
It's so nice drinking together.

263
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.292 line:80%
What do you mean? I drink a lot.

264
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.169 line:80%
You said you didn't drink.

265
00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:50.630 line:80%
You said you quit drinking

266
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:53.424 line:80%
since one big drunken mistake
you made before.

267
00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.635 line:80%
Me? A drunken mistake?

268
00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:57.095 line:80%
Are you okay?

269
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.607 line:80%
I did quit drinking for a while.

270
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:12.527 line:80%
But I started drinking again
because of Min-hwan...

271
00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.238 line:80%
Say what?

272
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.575 line:80%
You started drinking again
because of Mr. Park?

273
00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.453 line:80%
Not now, but five years from now.

274
00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:28.084 line:80%
Drinking in moderation is fine.

275
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:32.255 line:80%
Being scared of another mistake
seemed like a dumb idea to quit drinking.

276
00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:36.092 line:80%
-Do you want fried dumplings?
-Yeah!

277
00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:40.263 line:80%
-Can we get six more fried dumplings?
-Okay.

278
00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:43.933 line:80%
Back then, the drunken mistake
felt like a huge deal to me.

279
00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.768 line:80%
I had completely forgotten.

280
00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.898 line:80%
Why did I reflect so much
and become so withdrawn?

281
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.399 line:80%
Here are your dumplings.

282
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:52.859 line:80%
Thank you.

283
00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:54.986 line:80%
I really like you.

284
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.614 line:80%
You're bright and healthy.

285
00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.199 line:80%
Is that where your name comes from?

286
00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:01.576 line:80%
That's right.

287
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.037 line:80%
My name means "joyous connection."

288
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.372 line:80%
"Be a joyous connection to anyone."

289
00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:07.832 line:80%
That's my motto.

290
00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:09.959 line:80%
I knew it.

291
00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:11.628 line:80%
Let's make a toast!

292
00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.547 line:80%
-To a joyous...
-Connection!

293
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.598 line:80%
Try it. It's so good!

294
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.558 line:80%
-Like right now?
-Yeah!

295
00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:26.809 line:80%
Eat it right now?

296
00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.647 line:80%
Isn't it good? It's so good!

297
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.607 line:80%
Isn't it so good?

298
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.359 line:80%
To be honest with you,

299
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.235 line:80%
I'm glad we met today instead.

300
00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:39.906 line:80%
On Sundays, we can't drink so much
because we work the next day.

301
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:41.074 line:80%
You're right.

302
00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.410 line:80%
Isn't your reunion tomorrow?

303
00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.955 line:80%
-Shall we drink in moderation?
-Oh, that.

304
00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:50.291 line:80%
I haven't decided to go yet.

305
00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:56.965 line:80%
To be honest,
I wasn't just an unpopular girl.

306
00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:58.174 line:80%
I've been bullied.

307
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:01.094 line:80%
What? You were bullied?

308
00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:03.304 line:80%
But why?

309
00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:05.807 line:80%
I don't know.

310
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.976 line:80%
Everyone suddenly hated me.

311
00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:12.188 line:80%
So that made me feel small

312
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:14.148 line:80%
and make more mistakes.

313
00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:17.443 line:80%
And everyone hated me more for that.

314
00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.363 line:80%
You should've asked them why.

315
00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:22.573 line:80%
How could I?

316
00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:25.827 line:80%
How will you know if you don't ask?

317
00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.206 line:80%
Honestly, I'm the type to run away
when things get too hard,

318
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.917 line:80%
but you should try
all you can before that.

319
00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:37.463 line:80%
I need to know
if these people are simply crazy

320
00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:40.133 line:80%
or have good reasons

321
00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.135 line:80%
so I won't have regrets later.

322
00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:44.721 line:80%
No regrets?

323
00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:46.389 line:80%
Yeah.

324
00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:50.018 line:80%
It makes so much sense.
Why hasn't this occurred to me?

325
00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:54.939 line:80%
Su-min is just too nice.

326
00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:58.026 line:80%
Ever since high school, Ji-won--

327
00:21:58.109 --> 00:21:59.527 line:80%
Ye-ji, wait.

328
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.613 line:80%
Ji-won wasn't at her seat earlier.

329
00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:07.869 line:80%
I need to hear the rest.

330
00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:08.953 line:80%
You're right.

331
00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:12.999 line:80%
I should go if I don't want to regret it.

332
00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:20.590 line:80%
What is it?

333
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:23.676 line:80%
Turning a shameful past into history...

334
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.969 line:80%
It sounds easy,

335
00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:28.598 line:80%
but it can't be done overnight
for someone like me.

336
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.433 line:80%
That may be true.

337
00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:32.810 line:80%
But you can try.

338
00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:36.939 line:80%
-I can?
-A stitch in time saves nine!

339
00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:40.526 line:80%
Those who are prepared will not fail!

340
00:22:52.205 --> 00:22:53.664 line:80%
What are you doing?

341
00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:55.124 line:80%
I love dumplings.

342
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:58.169 line:80%
I want to eat them at home later.

343
00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:05.885 line:80%
It's finally time for me
to repay your kindness!

344
00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:28.199 line:80%
Hello!

345
00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:30.034 line:80%
It's been a while, Hui-yeon.

346
00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:33.538 line:80%
This is my favorite superior at work.

347
00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:34.664 line:80%
Hello.

348
00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:36.707 line:80%
Hello, I'm Designer Song Jae-min.

349
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.459 line:80%
Shall we go now?

350
00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:40.336 line:80%
Yeah, let's go.

351
00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:48.803 line:80%
I'm going to pay with my membership here.

352
00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:51.222 line:80%
-No, Hui-yeon.
-Hush!

353
00:23:51.305 --> 00:23:52.306 line:80%
My savior.

354
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:54.433 line:80%
Focus.

355
00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:56.727 line:80%
The membership that expires today?

356
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.729 line:80%
That's great news.

357
00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:01.524 line:80%
What would you have done
without her, Hui-yeon?

358
00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:04.569 line:80%
Your hair's so healthy.
Any style would look great.

359
00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:06.404 line:80%
Shall we do an S-curl perm?

360
00:24:06.487 --> 00:24:07.905 line:80%
How about a wavy perm?

361
00:24:09.532 --> 00:24:11.701 line:80%
A too radical change might make you

362
00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:14.579 line:80%
feel like
you're a completely different person.

363
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:18.541 line:80%
Let's do a soft wavy perm.
She needs an eyelash perm too.

364
00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:21.002 line:80%
-Let's trim her eyebrows--
-Wait.

365
00:24:24.797 --> 00:24:26.883 line:80%
I do want to be a different person.

366
00:24:31.888 --> 00:24:33.139 line:80%
Okay, got it.

367
00:24:33.222 --> 00:24:36.976 line:80%
Then you'll be reborn today.

368
00:24:38.853 --> 00:24:41.063 line:80%
Also, grab a new hair part for her.

369
00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:42.190 line:80%
And...

370
00:24:42.273 --> 00:24:43.357 line:80%
Her makeup!

371
00:24:43.441 --> 00:24:44.275 line:80%
Is Ms. Nam here?

372
00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:45.568 line:80%
Yes. I'll call her.

373
00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:50.364 line:80%
I'm going to introduce you to a new you.

374
00:24:50.448 --> 00:24:52.700 line:80%
You'll meet her in front of a mirror.

375
00:25:12.887 --> 00:25:15.306 line:80%
Those who aren't mentally mature like you

376
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:17.850 line:80%
judge others by their looks.

377
00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:21.520 line:80%
If you want something, dress accordingly.

378
00:25:21.604 --> 00:25:22.897 line:80%
That's the start.

379
00:26:03.938 --> 00:26:05.731 line:80%
You look incredible!

380
00:26:05.815 --> 00:26:07.066 line:80%
It looks good on you!

381
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.902 line:80%
You're so pretty. Do you like it?

382
00:27:15.885 --> 00:27:17.053 line:80%
How's this?

383
00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:22.266 line:80%
So nice!

384
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.695 line:80%
No, maybe next time.

385
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.323 line:80%
Why? It's great!

386
00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:41.494 line:80%
This needs to go to someone else.

387
00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:51.170 line:80%
Dude, you're spitting all over the meat.

388
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:52.463 line:80%
Is it a cold?

389
00:27:52.546 --> 00:27:55.049 line:80%
It's from the smoke! I'm not sick.

390
00:27:57.718 --> 00:28:00.513 line:80%
What? Your girl didn't pick up
or call you back?

391
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:02.390 line:80%
I don't call Ji-won.

392
00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:06.185 line:80%

You let them be, and they start to think.

396
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.071 line:80%
Once they start thinking, they'll give in.

397
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.408 line:80%
-You don't know anything.
-Help me with this.

398
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.451 line:80%
Watch.

The hammock!

401
00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:29.375 line:80%
I'm great with this.

402
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:31.502 line:80%
Shall we open it? One, two, three.

403
00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:39.135 line:80%
Come by and have some BBQ later.

404
00:28:52.148 --> 00:28:55.151 line:80%
But this bitch is holding out longer
than I thought.

405
00:28:56.277 --> 00:28:57.903 line:80%
You're going to die anyway.

406
00:28:58.696 --> 00:28:59.697 line:80%
Get lost!

407
00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:44.116 line:80%
The dumplings are cold now.

408
00:29:45.576 --> 00:29:47.119 line:80%
Excuse me. More dumplings...

409
00:29:56.462 --> 00:29:57.755 line:80%
Thanks, Hui-yeon.

410
00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:08.849 line:80%
About the meal kit.

411
00:30:08.933 --> 00:30:10.768 line:80%
I'll look at your proposal.

412
00:30:10.851 --> 00:30:12.728 line:80%
Ju-ran and Su-min will be on the team.

413
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:15.064 line:80%
They'll make up for what you lack.

414
00:30:16.482 --> 00:30:18.067 line:80%
Did he read my proposal?

415
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.820 line:80%
Jeong Su-min will be on the team?

416
00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:25.574 line:80%
Wait.

417
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.081 line:80%
You didn't forget about tomorrow, right?
Goseuljung, 5:30 p.m.

418
00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:35.543 line:80%
OKAY

419
00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:41.757 line:80%
Hello?

420
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.634 line:80%
Ji-won, it's me.

421
00:30:44.927 --> 00:30:46.595 line:80%
What did you do today?

422
00:30:48.347 --> 00:30:50.891 line:80%
I had
tteokbokki
with Hui-yeon today.

423
00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:53.227 line:80%
She's sleeping right now.

424
00:30:54.228 --> 00:30:56.814 line:80%
Yu Hui-yeon is
at your house right now? Why?

425
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:59.108 line:80%
We were talking, and she fell asleep.

426
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.110 line:80%
We had some drinks too.

427
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.491 line:80%
Hello?

428
00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:08.993 line:80%
You should've called me.

429
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.623 line:80%
Did I do something to upset you?

430
00:31:14.707 --> 00:31:18.210 line:80%
No. Did you do something
that might upset me?

431
00:31:18.294 --> 00:31:19.545 line:80%
No, nothing.

432
00:31:23.007 --> 00:31:25.801 line:80%
I called to ask for a favor.

433
00:31:28.637 --> 00:31:30.014 line:80%
What is it?

434
00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:34.727 line:80%
I was wondering...

435
00:31:35.352 --> 00:31:36.395 line:80%
This...

436
00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:37.980 line:80%
It's about your proposal.

437
00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:39.690 line:80%
...is great!

438
00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:41.066 line:80%
It's really great.

439
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.943 line:80%
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

440
00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:45.613 line:80%
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

441
00:31:45.696 --> 00:31:46.989 line:80%
What do you think?

442
00:31:52.286 --> 00:31:54.955 line:80%
No, you can't. It's my proposal.

443
00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:59.043 line:80%
Why not? Yours was rejected.
I got a good feeling.

444
00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:01.170 line:80%
I want to be a full-time employee.

445
00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:02.963 line:80%
Let's succeed together, pal!

446
00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:06.133 line:80%
You should've told me.

447
00:32:06.842 --> 00:32:08.302 line:80%
If I had known,

448
00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:10.179 line:80%
I wouldn't have fixed it.

449
00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:14.725 line:80%
Sorry, I'll give you my next good idea.

450
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:17.478 line:80%
Also...

451
00:32:20.356 --> 00:32:23.275 line:80%
Stop calling me by my name at work.

452
00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:26.570 line:80%
We're friends,
but we have different positions

453
00:32:26.654 --> 00:32:30.949 line:80%
and I'm more experienced. You're crossing
the line by making me run coffee errands

454
00:32:31.033 --> 00:32:32.284 line:80%
and ordering me around.

455
00:32:33.494 --> 00:32:36.580 line:80%
Let's not mix business
with pleasure, okay?

456
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.335 line:80%
-What?
-I've got to go. See you tomorrow.

457
00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:50.636 line:80%
What was that?

458
00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:56.100 line:80%
Ji-won, how dare you do this to me?

459
00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:04.066 line:80%
I changed my reservations for you
to go to the reunion.

460
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:06.151 line:80%
See you tomorrow, girl.

461
00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:09.363 line:80%
I love you. See you tomorrow.

462
00:33:09.446 --> 00:33:11.865 line:80%
I bought new earrings to show you, Ye-ji!

463
00:33:15.536 --> 00:33:16.870 line:80%
I swear.

464
00:33:16.954 --> 00:33:20.666 line:80%
Just when I put my guard down,
she forgets what a loser she is.

465
00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:23.252 line:80%
It's okay.

466
00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:25.504 line:80%
I'll just have to teach her again.

467
00:33:26.255 --> 00:33:28.924 line:80%
Make sure to wear the earrings I got you.

00:33:44.898 --> 00:33:46.942 line:80%
I said I'd be with you, so she's okay.

472

477

Here.

479
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:11.508 line:80%
So what if my mom raised me like this?

480
00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:15.596 line:80%
I need to meet a reliable man like you

-Wait.

484
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.907 line:80%
Of course.

GOSEULJUNG

490
00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:30.587 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won.

491
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.631 line:80%
Hey, where are you?

492
00:35:39.221 --> 00:35:41.598 line:80%
I'll get you if you can't find your way.

493
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:45.853 line:80%
I'm here. I'm behind you.

494
00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:57.114 line:80%
Ji-won...

495
00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:02.202 line:80%
What's going on?
It wasn't just us for dinner?

496
00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:13.130 line:80%
It's been a long time.

497
00:36:18.969 --> 00:36:20.637 line:80%
Wow, what happened?

498
00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:23.348 line:80%
How did the loser Kang Ji-won
get so pretty?

499
00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.353 line:80%
I don't remember you,
so you're pretty much a stranger.

500
00:36:28.437 --> 00:36:29.438 line:80%
You're very rude.

501
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:32.190 line:80%
Was I? Sorry.

502
00:36:32.274 --> 00:36:34.318 line:80%
I'm so clueless.

503
00:36:35.152 --> 00:36:36.653 line:80%
He hasn't changed.

504
00:36:36.737 --> 00:36:38.071 line:80%
He was clueless then.

505
00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:40.073 line:80%
-He's still clueless now.
-Wow.

506
00:36:41.074 --> 00:36:43.493 line:80%
You even copied Su-min's earrings.

507
00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:45.954 line:80%
And you want to talk about manners?

508
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:50.584 line:80%
Earrings?

509
00:36:51.835 --> 00:36:53.462 line:80%
No, they're not the same.

510
00:36:54.046 --> 00:36:56.590 line:80%
These look really nice.

511
00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:02.512 line:80%
Those look a little cheap.

512
00:37:03.138 --> 00:37:04.765 line:80%
Are those knockoffs?

513
00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:06.808 line:80%
Wow, did you copy her?

514
00:37:06.892 --> 00:37:09.645 line:80%
Su-min,
you should've bought authentic ones.

515
00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:11.772 line:80%
There are so many great knockoffs.

516
00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:14.691 line:80%
Forget it. It can happen if you're broke.

517
00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:19.154 line:80%
FIVE HOURS AGO

518
00:37:27.621 --> 00:37:30.415 line:80%
Makeup is a skill.
You get better with practice.

519
00:37:44.638 --> 00:37:46.598 line:80%
When it comes to knockoffs...

520
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:48.350 line:80%
No.

521
00:37:48.433 --> 00:37:49.935 line:80%
For copies,

522
00:37:50.018 --> 00:37:53.313 line:80%
there are different grades.
S grade, A grade, B grade.

523
00:37:53.397 --> 00:37:55.899 line:80%
Anyone can tell
these are super fake dupes.

524
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:58.068 line:80%
They are?

525
00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:02.406 line:80%
They're knockoffs that don't have
the decency to pretend to look real.

526
00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:08.370 line:80%
There's only one reason
for a gift like this.

527
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:12.541 line:80%
Humiliation.

528
00:38:17.129 --> 00:38:18.880 line:80%
-I...
-Let's have a drink.

529
00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:20.590 line:80%
I'm sure you had one more.

530
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:22.342 line:80%
To show that I copied you

531
00:38:22.426 --> 00:38:26.054 line:80%
so yours look real compared to mine.

532
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.557 line:80%
-I...
-But...

533
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.142 line:80%
too bad.

534
00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:31.935 line:80%
Wear mine to dinner!

535
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.023 line:80%
I think I found a real friend.

536
00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:37.649 line:80%
Excuse me.

537
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:14.895 line:80%
Kang Ji-won is incredible.

538
00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:17.272 line:80%
Why did she come? She has no friends here.

539
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.024 line:80%
She must be here to eat.

540
00:39:19.107 --> 00:39:21.318 line:80%
Did you see her? She looks so poor.

541
00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:28.825 line:80%
Kang Ji-won is incredible.

542
00:39:28.909 --> 00:39:30.994 line:80%
Why did she come? She has no friends here.

543
00:39:31.078 --> 00:39:32.579 line:80%
She must be here to brag.

544
00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:34.915 line:80%
Did you see her? Everything looked new.

545
00:39:34.998 --> 00:39:38.335 line:80%
Why are you talking like
you're from Seoul? It's weird.

546
00:39:38.543 --> 00:39:41.338 line:80%
Still, how is she still hanging out
with Su-min?

547
00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:42.547 line:80%
Isn't it obvious?

548
00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:46.134 line:80%
Su-min, that softie is
just too nice to her.

549
00:39:46.218 --> 00:39:48.553 line:80%
She stays by her and steals everything!

550
00:39:48.637 --> 00:39:50.514 line:80%
I hate her.

551
00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:52.224 line:80%
She really is incredible.

552
00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:56.728 line:80%
Su-min is just too nice.

553
00:39:57.187 --> 00:39:58.814 line:80%
We should take care of her.

554
00:39:58.897 --> 00:40:01.983 line:80%
Ever since high school, Ji-won--

555
00:40:02.067 --> 00:40:03.443 line:80%
Ye-ji, wait.

556
00:40:04.486 --> 00:40:05.570 line:80%
What?

557
00:40:05.654 --> 00:40:07.697 line:80%
Ji-won wasn't at her seat earlier.

558
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:51.449 line:80%
Were you here all this time?

559
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.911 line:80%
-Why did you pretend like you weren't? I--
-Then...

560
00:40:55.412 --> 00:40:56.997 line:80%
I came in here first.

561
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.332 line:80%
Do I have to come out to greet you?

562
00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:12.721 line:80%
Don't mind me and keep talking.

563
00:41:12.804 --> 00:41:14.055 line:80%
I'm curious too.

564
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:17.017 line:80%
What did I do to Su-min in high school?

565
00:41:18.518 --> 00:41:19.519 line:80%
You don't know?

566
00:41:19.603 --> 00:41:22.105 line:80%
You coveted and copied everything of hers.

567
00:41:22.355 --> 00:41:24.941 line:80%
Didn't you copy Su-min
with those earrings?

568
00:41:28.862 --> 00:41:29.863 line:80%
These?

569
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.699 line:80%
Su-min gave these to me as a gift.

570
00:41:40.415 --> 00:41:41.541 line:80%
But they were fake.

571
00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:43.251 line:80%
It was too obvious.

572
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:46.463 line:80%
So I bought the authentic ones.

573
00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:49.132 line:80%
Still, they're matching earrings, right?

574
00:41:50.926 --> 00:41:52.135 line:80%
I'm still curious.

575
00:41:53.553 --> 00:41:56.056 line:80%
What else did I covet of hers?

576
00:41:56.806 --> 00:41:58.350 line:80%
A guy!

577
00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:02.562 line:80%
What's his name? Park Min-hwan!
I heard you were interested in her guy.

578
00:42:02.979 --> 00:42:04.564 line:80%
People don't change.

579
00:42:04.648 --> 00:42:08.443 line:80%
Su-min dated Eun-ho in high school,
and you made them break up.

580
00:42:10.487 --> 00:42:13.114 line:80%
I told Su-min to break up with Eun-ho?

581
00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:15.408 line:80%
They were dating?

582
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:18.870 line:80%
And Su-min has something going on
with Min-hwan?

583
00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:21.122 line:80%
She recommended you for a job

584
00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:24.167 line:80%
at a company like U&K,
and you stole her man.

585
00:42:24.251 --> 00:42:25.752 line:80%
That's crossing the line.

586
00:42:27.045 --> 00:42:29.422 line:80%
I can't even deal with this.

587
00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:32.634 line:80%
-What did you say?
-Hey.

588
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.514 line:80%
If you're going to be mean
after hearing one side of the story,

589
00:42:37.597 --> 00:42:40.308 line:80%
at least try to fact-check first.

590
00:42:43.937 --> 00:42:44.938 line:80%
Listen up.

591
00:42:47.065 --> 00:42:48.775 line:80%
U&K FOOD MARKETING
ASSISTANT MANAGER KANG JI-WON

592
00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:50.735 line:80%
I'm an assistant manager at U&K.

593
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:53.947 line:80%
I hear contract workers get cards too.

594
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.991 line:80%
What's this? How can we trust you?

595
00:42:56.074 --> 00:42:59.494 line:80%
I joined the company seven years ago.
When did Su-min join?

596
00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:04.749 line:80%
I remember recommending her
in my second year as assistant manager.

597
00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:07.669 line:80%
-About last year?
-That's right.

598
00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:11.214 line:80%
I asked about her cover letter,
so it was early last year.

599
00:43:13.008 --> 00:43:14.384 line:80%
The strangest thing

600
00:43:14.884 --> 00:43:16.261 line:80%
is about Park Min-hwan.

601
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.555 line:80%
He's my boyfriend.

602
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:24.978 line:80%
PARK MIN-HWAN

603
00:43:25.061 --> 00:43:25.895 line:80%
SPEAKER

604
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:33.945 line:80%
Hey, babe.

605
00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:36.323 line:80%
I'm at my school reunion. Did you call?

606
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.533 line:80%
What?

607
00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:41.369 line:80%
I wanted you to have fun,
so I didn't call.

608
00:43:41.453 --> 00:43:42.787 line:80%
I must've butt-dialed.

609
00:43:44.247 --> 00:43:47.125 line:80%
I see. That's great.

610
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:49.586 line:80%
Say hi to my friends.

611
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:52.422 line:80%
Friends?

612
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:57.177 line:80%
Hello.

613
00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.264 line:80%
Hi, we're Ji-won's friends.

614
00:44:01.348 --> 00:44:04.100 line:80%
Are you really Ji-won's boyfriend?

615
00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:07.437 line:80%
Hello, I'm Ji-won's boyfriend.
Park Min-hwan.

616
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.482 line:80%
I didn't know Ji-won had friends
other than Su-min.

617
00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:12.901 line:80%
Take care of Ji-won for me.

618
00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:14.069 line:80%
I should've said--

619
00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:15.570 line:80%
Hello? Hey?

620
00:44:18.406 --> 00:44:19.407 line:80%
What was that?

621
00:44:23.161 --> 00:44:24.371 line:80%
Good enough?

622
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.391 line:80%
Ji-won!

623
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:48.645 line:80%
-Where are you going?
-You...

624
00:44:48.728 --> 00:44:49.979 line:80%
Hey, Kang Ji-won!

625
00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:55.110 line:80%
Yeah, fine.

626
00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:56.653 line:80%
But back in high school,

627
00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:59.239 line:80%
why did you tell her
to dump her boyfriend?

628
00:45:11.418 --> 00:45:13.128 line:80%
Stop it, guys!

629
00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:16.798 line:80%
You shouldn't torment your friends. Don't!

630
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:17.882 line:80%
So dirty!

631
00:45:20.135 --> 00:45:22.303 line:80%
I almost forgot.

632
00:45:23.638 --> 00:45:25.098 line:80%
That's so strange.

633
00:45:26.015 --> 00:45:28.601 line:80%
I did have feelings for Eun-ho.

634
00:45:28.685 --> 00:45:30.770 line:80%
Su-min never dated him.

635
00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:35.692 line:80%
Did you date Eun-ho?

636
00:45:45.118 --> 00:45:46.119 line:80%
Well...

637
00:45:51.624 --> 00:45:54.919 line:80%
I'm sorry, Ji-won.
I couldn't tell you back then.

638
00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:57.213 line:80%
I knew you liked Eun-ho.

639
00:45:57.797 --> 00:45:59.924 line:80%
How could I tell you we were dating?

640
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:08.016 line:80%
What are you talking about?
You said I told you to dump him.

641
00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:09.767 line:80%
Then shouldn't I have known?

642
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:15.732 line:80%
I made a mistake.

643
00:46:15.815 --> 00:46:18.776 line:80%
It was a secret relationship,
so I didn't tell you.

644
00:46:18.902 --> 00:46:21.196 line:80%
Did I know or not?

645
00:46:24.657 --> 00:46:27.160 line:80%
How terrifying. Ji-won, you're scary!

646
00:46:27.243 --> 00:46:29.746 line:80%
You have no friends
because of your temper.

647
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:33.249 line:80%
-Why are you nitpicking?
-You did the same, so I did too.

648
00:46:34.751 --> 00:46:36.711 line:80%
I didn't ask questions back then.

649
00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:39.797 line:80%
Did you forget how you tormented me
for three years?

650
00:46:41.049 --> 00:46:44.302 line:80%
Even now, I showed you my card
and explained everything.

651
00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:46.346 line:80%
And now you don't like my temper.

652
00:46:46.888 --> 00:46:48.640 line:80%
What if your card is fake?

653
00:46:49.224 --> 00:46:51.476 line:80%
Like the fake bag you brought tonight?

654
00:46:53.102 --> 00:46:55.021 line:80%
What the hell are you saying?

655
00:46:55.104 --> 00:46:57.232 line:80%
I went to the department store

656
00:46:57.315 --> 00:47:00.818 line:80%
and bought this in 12 monthly installments
with my first paycheck!

657
00:47:01.236 --> 00:47:02.278 line:80%
Or not.

658
00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:05.406 line:80%
You're a funny one.

659
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.368 line:80%
You call it fake based on an assumption

660
00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:10.537 line:80%
and now what? "Or not?"

661
00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.914 line:80%
Then what more should I say?

662
00:47:13.456 --> 00:47:15.959 line:80%
You should apologize and say you're sorry!

663
00:47:16.042 --> 00:47:17.794 line:80%
You should apologize to me!

664
00:47:21.256 --> 00:47:22.465 line:80%
You believed Su-min

665
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:24.634 line:80%
and bullied me for three years.

666
00:47:25.677 --> 00:47:28.638 line:80%
Do you still want to do this
at a high school reunion?

667
00:47:32.392 --> 00:47:33.643 line:80%
I understand.

668
00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:37.855 line:80%
You don't want to apologize because
you just wanted to bully me. Right?

669
00:47:37.981 --> 00:47:39.482 line:80%
What are you saying?

670
00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:43.444 line:80%
I'm a very honest person.

671
00:47:43.987 --> 00:47:47.615 line:80%
So you're saying
Su-min and Eun-ho didn't date, right?

672
00:47:47.949 --> 00:47:51.452 line:80%
The parties involved said they did.
Who are you to say that?

673
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:56.416 line:80%
I don't know about anything else...

674
00:48:12.932 --> 00:48:14.642 line:80%
But I can tell you one thing.

675
00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:21.274 line:80%
Su-min and I

676
00:48:24.569 --> 00:48:25.612 line:80%
never dated.

677
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.464 line:80%
It's been a long time, Ji-won.

678
00:48:50.011 --> 00:48:51.638 line:80%
What are you talking about?

679
00:48:54.766 --> 00:48:55.767 line:80%
No need.

680
00:48:59.646 --> 00:49:01.856 line:80%
-I'm sorry.
-Explain yourself.

681
00:49:02.482 --> 00:49:03.733 line:80%
This is a promise.

682
00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:05.026 line:80%
When you break it,

683
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:08.571 line:80%
you must give a suitable reason.
I can't understand it,

684
00:49:09.781 --> 00:49:11.866 line:80%
so how can I ask for understanding?

685
00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:14.077 line:80%
I can't explain.

686
00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:16.079 line:80%
It's not right,

687
00:49:17.455 --> 00:49:18.831 line:80%
so I can't do it.

688
00:49:21.167 --> 00:49:22.627 line:80%
Ji-hyuk,

689
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.047 line:80%
you will inherit U&K Group.

690
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:29.092 line:80%
As the CEO,
is that what you're going to say to people

691
00:49:29.676 --> 00:49:31.886 line:80%
when you make important decisions?

692
00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:34.055 line:80%
Is that how you'll run the company?

693
00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:37.809 line:80%
If I take over,
I'm sure no one will ask me to explain.

694
00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:45.608 line:80%
No matter how good you are,

695
00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:50.029 line:80%
you can't beat someone
who works hand-in-hand with another.

696
00:49:50.113 --> 00:49:51.989 line:80%
Traditionally, a great man

697
00:49:52.615 --> 00:49:54.701 line:80%
must have a partner.

698
00:49:54.784 --> 00:49:56.744 line:80%
A great partner.

699
00:49:58.454 --> 00:49:59.497 line:80%
Do you think so?

700
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.124 line:80%
Yes, even your father...

701
00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:09.132 line:80%
Young people these days

702
00:50:09.215 --> 00:50:12.468 line:80%
talk nonsense about
how it's better not to get married.

703
00:50:12.552 --> 00:50:13.803 line:80%
Do you feel that way too?

704
00:50:14.554 --> 00:50:15.555 line:80%
Marriage...

705
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.182 line:80%
is what I want.

706
00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:21.853 line:80%
There's someone I like.

707
00:50:23.896 --> 00:50:25.148 line:80%
Anyway.

708
00:50:26.899 --> 00:50:27.900 line:80%
That's that.

709
00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:35.908 line:80%
Do I know her?

710
00:50:37.869 --> 00:50:40.455 line:80%
Which family is she from? What's her name?

711
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.042 line:80%
It's one-sided.

712
00:50:49.255 --> 00:50:50.590 line:80%
What?

713
00:50:51.883 --> 00:50:54.260 line:80%
I studied business as told.

714
00:50:54.343 --> 00:50:56.262 line:80%
I went to the US branch as told.

715
00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:59.682 line:80%
I joined the marketing team
after you asked me to return.

716
00:50:59.766 --> 00:51:02.143 line:80%
I did everything you asked, Grandfather.

717
00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:03.853 line:80%
This time,

718
00:51:05.438 --> 00:51:06.606 line:80%
just trust me.

719
00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:08.608 line:80%
How dare you?

720
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:10.568 line:80%
Did you think I wouldn't know?

721
00:51:10.651 --> 00:51:11.652 line:80%
When have you

722
00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:15.072 line:80%
ever done anything you didn't want to?

723
00:51:15.156 --> 00:51:18.534 line:80%
You listened to me
because you didn't have your own dreams.

724
00:51:18.618 --> 00:51:20.036 line:80%
It was always like that.

725
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.998 line:80%
Then you should know
I'll go my way this time too.

726
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:25.333 line:80%
What? You little...

727
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:39.889 line:80%
I'm letting you know.

728
00:51:42.725 --> 00:51:44.060 line:80%
I like someone.

729
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.899 line:80%
I don't want any issues with women.

730
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:18.261 line:80%
Who is this woman he's fallen for?

731
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:20.179 line:80%
Look into it.

732
00:52:20.763 --> 00:52:24.392 line:80%
He's never made a mistake before.

733
00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:26.519 line:80%
That's what scares me more.

734
00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:30.356 line:80%
People don't just turn over
a new leaf like that.

735
00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.777 line:80%
True. He's not the kind of man
who would be persistent

736
00:52:35.528 --> 00:52:36.654 line:80%
about women issues.

737
00:52:38.114 --> 00:52:39.115 line:80%
Then...

738
00:52:40.283 --> 00:52:41.701 line:80%
What about Chairman Oh?

739
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:43.870 line:80%
I can't control my own son.

740
00:52:43.953 --> 00:52:46.163 line:80%
How can I control my grandson?

741
00:52:47.456 --> 00:52:49.792 line:80%
Apart from that, if he can't, he can't.

742
00:52:51.586 --> 00:52:53.629 line:80%
After his mother died,

743
00:52:54.714 --> 00:52:56.382 line:80%
he never spoke for long.

744
00:52:58.342 --> 00:53:00.386 line:80%
Why is he suddenly like this?

745
00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:04.056 line:80%
-Then...
-Look into it.

746
00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:07.643 line:80%
The sooner we nip it in the bud,
the better.

747
00:53:20.281 --> 00:53:21.449 line:80%
This is hard.

748
00:53:22.283 --> 00:53:24.076 line:80%
There's a high school reunion.

749
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.494 line:80%
A high school reunion?

750
00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.582 line:80%
By chance, do I know you?

751
00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:32.585 line:80%
No, I just thought
you should know about it.

752
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:35.212 line:80%
Why would you tell me?

753
00:53:35.296 --> 00:53:36.797 line:80%
Do you remember Kang Ji-won?

754
00:53:39.342 --> 00:53:42.053 line:80%
I know there was
a misunderstanding back then.

755
00:53:42.136 --> 00:53:45.389 line:80%
If it's okay with you,
it'd be good to clear the air.

756
00:53:45.473 --> 00:53:46.891 line:80%
Misunderstanding?

757
00:53:46.974 --> 00:53:50.353 line:80%
No, wait. Who would it be good for?

758
00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:54.065 line:80%
It will benefit Kang Ji-won.

759
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:56.567 line:80%
Please.

760
00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:10.915 line:80%
GOSEULJUNG

761
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:20.633 line:80%
-Yes.
-
Sir, where are you?

762
00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:22.885 line:80%
-Are you on your way?
-
I'm on my way.

763
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:32.353 line:80%
Isn't that Baek Eun-ho?

764
00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:35.189 line:80%
-It is him!
-He's completely fine.

765
00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:37.733 line:80%
Why didn't you answer my calls?

766
00:54:37.817 --> 00:54:39.944 line:80%
Wait, what are you doing here?

767
00:54:40.027 --> 00:54:41.404 line:80%
Actually, never mind.

768
00:54:41.988 --> 00:54:42.989 line:80%
Did you just say

769
00:54:44.115 --> 00:54:46.409 line:80%
you and Su-min never dated?

770
00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:51.664 line:80%
By the way,

771
00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:55.376 line:80%
did you like me?

772
00:54:57.336 --> 00:54:59.880 line:80%
Then why did you do that back then?

773
00:55:13.436 --> 00:55:16.480 line:80%
GOSEULJUNG

774
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:53.768 line:80%
She dressed up like that

775
00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.187 line:80%
to go to the reunion?

776
00:56:18.793 --> 00:56:19.877 line:80%
Wait.

777
00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:23.964 line:80%
Stop.

778
00:56:24.048 --> 00:56:25.883 line:80%
What I mean to say is...

779
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.016 line:80%
Sorry about that.

780
00:56:35.935 --> 00:56:37.269 line:80%
Let me wipe your hand.

781
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.488 line:80%
What am I doing?

782
00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:55.162 line:80%
I have to go now.

783
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.042 line:80%
Yeah. Okay.

784
00:57:01.252 --> 00:57:03.712 line:80%
No.

785
00:57:03.796 --> 00:57:06.966 line:80%
I want to say something.

786
00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:08.467 line:80%
I never liked you.

787
00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:11.220 line:80%
That was

788
00:57:12.596 --> 00:57:14.014 line:80%
just a slip of a tongue.

789
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:22.022 line:80%
I...

790
00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:25.276 line:80%
had a crush on you!

791
00:58:19.205 --> 00:58:24.168 line:80%
From now on, I won't just foolishly
stick to formalities anymore.

792
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:25.794 line:80%
You're so pretty.

793
00:58:25.878 --> 00:58:27.671 line:80%
-I'm sorry.
-It made him crazy.

794
00:58:27.796 --> 00:58:29.215 line:80%
You look really pretty.

795
00:58:29.298 --> 00:58:32.092 line:80%
You bullied her on your own,
don't come at me!

796
00:58:32.176 --> 00:58:35.804 line:80%
Don't worry, my other half.
This time, I really won't let it slide.

797
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:39.934 line:80%
Mr. Yu. It's nice to see you smile.

798
00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:42.478 line:80%
I think Yu Ji-hyuk likes you.

799
00:58:43.312 --> 00:58:45.564 line:80%
Right. There was a scandal about them.

800
00:58:45.648 --> 00:58:46.982 line:80%
Shall I just tell Ji-won?

801
00:58:47.066 --> 00:58:50.194 line:80%
That Min-hwan will cheat
on her with Su-min and hurt her.
