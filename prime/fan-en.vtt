00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.594 line:82%
A connection
is a strange thing.

2
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.888 line:82%
Don't ask how it works.

3
00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.230 line:82%
Our friendship goes back years.

4
00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:05.649 line:82%
Our connection is stronger
than Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.

5
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:08.694 line:82%
The best actor award
goes to Aryan Khanna.

6
00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:10.112 line:82%
First time
I'm getting an award,

7
00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:12.698 line:82%
a major award in the film industry.

8
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.659 line:82%
This one's for you, Mom.
Thank you very much.

9
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.413 line:82%
He taught me everything,
not just how to walk and jump.

10
00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:25.127 line:82%
Aryan? What a moron!

11
00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:29.715 line:82%
Everyone insults him,
so I get into fights.

12
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:37.973 line:82%
If I copy his style,
I get a beating.

13
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.267 line:82%
I don't think I've done enough work.
It's just been five years.

14
00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.187 line:82%
I still have a long way to go
as an actor and as a star.

15
00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:47.149 line:82%
I'll work hard and prove to be
a true superstar.

16
00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:50.486 line:82%
I never compare myself
to others.

17
00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:52.196 line:82%
What is better is to say
that you are the best

18
00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:53.697 line:82%
and not bother about others.

19
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.283 line:82%
You're the greatest.
But I'm better.

20
00:01:56.325 --> 00:02:01.455 line:82%
I never met him,
but I spend all day with him.

21
00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:04.375 line:82%
That's a real connection.

22
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:09.171 line:82%
Whatever he does, I cut, copy,
paste, and replicate.

23
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:10.798 line:82%
There's only a tiny difference.

24
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.466 line:82%
He became a star.

25
00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:14.927 line:82%
And I became his fan.

26
00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.432 line:82%
And something else:

27
00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:22.142 line:82%
We live together...

28
00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:26.146 line:82%
in one movie theater
or the other.

29
00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.904 line:82%
The real drama will start now!

30
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.711 line:82%
All these years, none
of my achievements are my own.

31
00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:52.256 line:82%
Whoever and wherever
I am today,

32
00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:54.341 line:82%
it's all thanks to my fans.

33
00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:57.344 line:82%
Without my fans, I'm nothing.

34
00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:01.265 line:82%
Can't you even get
good grades?

35
00:03:01.307 --> 00:03:03.183 line:82%
It's always "Aryan, Aryan."

36
00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.694 line:82%
My parents don't get it.

37
00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:17.573 line:82%
He's not just a star,
he's my world.

38
00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:20.659 line:82%
But God made a big mistake.

39
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.786 line:82%
When He was making Aryan,
there was some clay left,

40
00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:24.204 line:82%
and God used it to make me.

41
00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.961 line:82%
He and I are different,
worlds apart.

42
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:32.087 line:82%
But we are one.

43
00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:37.509 line:82%
He is Aryan and me,
I'm Aryan Jr.

44
00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:07.081 line:82%
I topped off your phone.
200 rupees.

45
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.000 line:82%
Send the money tomorrow.
Don't worry.

46
00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:11.794 line:82%
Tomorrow is fine.

47
00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.296 line:82%
The shop is closing
early today.

48
00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:16.256 line:82%
Check your phone.

49
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:19.593 line:82%
You're a gem.
Bye, auntie.

50
00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:23.013 line:82%
Okay, Batman, Superman!
Enough slaughter!

51
00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:24.890 line:82%
Stop playing.
Kill the bad guys tomorrow.

52
00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:28.268 line:82%
-Gaurav, what's this?
-It's only 5:30, dude.

53
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.523 line:82%
Don't act smart, I told you.
You're out by 5:30.

54
00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.985 line:82%
Go home, kids.
Don't mess with me.

55
00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:45.995 line:82%
Everything okay?

56
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.247 line:82%
Miss Call Center, where were you?

57
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.249 line:82%
-I'm closing.
-So early?

58
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.543 line:82%
-I have a show.
-Five minutes, please.

59
00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.504 line:82%
No. I'll be late.

60
00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:59.008 line:82%
Only five minutes.
It's urgent.

61
00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.301 line:82%
I need a recommendation letter
for my US visa.

62
00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:03.762 line:82%
I have a costume fitting.

63
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.806 line:82%
Can you do it later...?
Okay, then.

64
00:05:05.848 --> 00:05:06.849 line:82%
Thanks!

65
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.059 line:82%
Five minutes only.

66
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.687 line:82%
You're kicking us out,
but she--

67
00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.898 line:82%
She has urgent business.
You just shoot partridges.

68
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.484 line:82%
Yeah, I get what's urgent.

69
00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:22.698 line:82%
Come back tomorrow.
Get lost!

70
00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:26.744 line:82%
Losers!

71
00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:44.386 line:82%
Sitting here dreaming of America
won't help you.

72
00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:49.308 line:82%
But staring at Aryan's photo
will help you?

73
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.769 line:82%
-Two minutes left.
-All done.

74
00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:54.938 line:82%
Thank you.

75
00:05:56.774 --> 00:06:00.319 line:82%
What do I owe you?

76
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.864 line:82%
Forget it. I can't charge you
for five minutes.

77
00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:07.493 line:82%
-Thanks.
-Enjoy!

78
00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.666 line:82%
Guys, we're closed.

79
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.336 line:82%
So the action just left?

80
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.046 line:82%
What's 30 minutes?

81
00:06:19.088 --> 00:06:21.423 line:82%
I put this notice up a week ago.

82
00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:23.383 line:82%
"Due to the grand Dussehra show,

83
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:27.221 line:82%
organized by the Resident Welfare
Association Inder Vihar, DDA Colony,

84
00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:30.099 line:82%
AK Cyber Chat closes
at 5:30 p.m. sharp

85
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.852 line:82%
by order Gaurav Chandna,
proprietor AK Cyber Chat."

86
00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.229 line:82%
See you again soon.

87
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.399 line:82%
If I knew English well,
I'd be a computer myself.

88
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.779 line:82%
The shop won't stay open,
not even for the Prime Minister.

89
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:45.989 line:82%
I said it's closed.
You'll get extra time tomorrow.

90
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:49.201 line:82%
You Photocopy!
Don't be cruel like Ravan.

91
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:52.162 line:82%
This boy needs to watch porn.
He's upset.

92
00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:54.081 line:82%
Go ahead! Sit there.

93
00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:57.042 line:82%
I don't heal troubled minds
at Cyber Chat.

94
00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:01.213 line:82%
There's no porn allowed here
anyway. Out, you guys!

95
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:06.301 line:82%
You better outgrow Aryan Khanna.
Sid Kapoor is the man now.

96
00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.012 line:82%
Get smart, Photocopy.

97
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.682 line:82%
The store in Sector 28 is open.

98
00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:15.936 line:82%
-Go there.
-Don't you dare touch me!

99
00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:18.480 line:82%
-Don't touch.
-Here, I'm touching.

100
00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:26.446 line:82%
Get out of here.

101
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.436 line:82%
Let go! They need a lesson.

102
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.897 line:82%
Want to see porn? Huh?

103
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.024 line:82%
What are you doing?

104
00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:05.819 line:82%
Nothing. I let you chat,
so they caused trouble.

105
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:07.404 line:82%
I'm fine.

106
00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:09.198 line:82%
You can all go. Thank you!

107
00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:12.784 line:82%
Those unemployed morons!

108
00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:16.580 line:82%
They came to watch dirty movies.
I gave them what for.

109
00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:20.751 line:82%
Why play the hero?
Why didn't you call for help?

110
00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.502 line:82%
But I did call you.

111
00:08:25.297 --> 00:08:26.474 line:82%
My heart did.

112
00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:29.551 line:82%
So you came back.

113
00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:33.847 line:82%
Please, Gaurav!
Stop talking like Aryan!

114
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:36.600 line:82%
Forget it. Are you
coming to the show tonight?

115
00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:39.353 line:82%
I'm too busy.
I don't have free time like you.

116
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.064 line:82%
Today's a birthday special.

117
00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:44.733 line:82%
-No, thank you.
-You're welcome.

118
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.869 line:82%
How did you get hurt?

119
00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:58.956 line:82%
Who hit you? I'll complain
to the association.

120
00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.833 line:82%
It's fine. Don't ruin
my concentration.

121
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:06.255 line:82%
Concentration? You can't move.
How will you go on stage?

122
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:11.426 line:82%
The prize is 20,000.
20 thousand! Cash!

123
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.263 line:82%
You won't give me 20,000
to go and meet Aryan.

124
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.307 line:82%
It's my only chance
to fulfill my dream.

125
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:20.602 line:82%
I don't have money to burn
on your silly dreams.

126
00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:24.106 line:82%
What about your Tuesday trips
to the Hanuman temple?

127
00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.150 line:82%
Doesn't your 101 rupee donation
go up in smoke?

128
00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.320 line:82%
Hanumanji is a god,
and your Aryan--

129
00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:33.532 line:82%
He's important to me.
Most important!

130
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.451 line:82%
Every fool has met him,
except me.

131
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.869 line:82%
Spray me with perfume.

132
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.748 line:82%
-Okay! Okay!
-Here.

133
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.334 line:82%
-Careful.
-If you can't do it, never mind.

134
00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:46.962 line:82%
My fans are waiting.
Get ready.

135
00:09:47.004 --> 00:09:49.172 line:82%
Listen to your mother!
Enough drama!

136
00:09:50.944 --> 00:09:52.643 line:82%
The real drama starts now.

137
00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:55.304 line:82%
Hold on to your hearts.

138
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:59.057 line:82%
You're about to see a performance

139
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:02.602 line:82%
that the Western Union,
"moving money for better,"

140
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:06.898 line:82%
Super Star competition
can never do without.

141
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.443 line:82%
You guessed right.

142
00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:13.322 line:82%
Here he comes.
The two-year winner:

143
00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:17.951 line:82%
Our Aryan Khanna Junior!

144
00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.615 line:82%
Mrs. Jindal!

145
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.617 line:82%
Is your pressure cooker
on the stove?

146
00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.036 line:82%
Because the only whistle
you'll hear today is right here.

147
00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.498 line:82%
My hat trick year.

148
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:09.836 line:82%
Today I'll share something
personal about me and Aryan.

149
00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:11.755 line:82%
I hide nothing from you

150
00:11:11.797 --> 00:11:15.425 line:82%
I'm no ace at romance.

151
00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:20.055 line:82%
But when I see her,
my emotions go haywire.

152
00:11:20.097 --> 00:11:21.973 line:82%
Words escape me.

153
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:28.730 line:82%
Senior is an expert at stealing hearts,

154
00:11:29.724 --> 00:11:32.526 line:82%
so I asked him... to help his Junior.

155
00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:43.703 line:82%
It's delicate.
I must tread carefully.

156
00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.747 line:82%
Don't forget!

157
00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:48.667 line:82%
The heart's job is to beat.

158
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.503 line:82%
When you count the night stars

159
00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:55.173 line:82%
and yearn to etch my name
on every star,

160
00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:58.343 line:82%
you know you're in love.

161
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.513 line:82%
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead,

162
00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:05.767 line:82%
when you look for me in a crowd?

163
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:08.228 line:82%
You know you're in love.

164
00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:11.648 line:82%
If you don't believe me...

165
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.608 line:82%
then hold my hand.

166
00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:19.698 line:82%
If your heart stops,
then you know... you're in love.

167
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.413 line:82%
I don't have your style, Senior.

168
00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:31.251 line:82%
But if anyone insults you,
l want to break their teeth.

169
00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:34.212 line:82%
My Mom tells me,
"Calm down.

170
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.548 line:82%
Aryan is India's sweetheart."

171
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.176 line:82%
But he's a Delhi boy after all.

172
00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:43.597 line:82%
Come, Senior. Let's show them
some Delhi muscle.

173
00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.554 line:82%
Mom used to say:

174
00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.557 line:82%
"Don't weigh
the food you're eating.

175
00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:33.146 line:82%
And don't count the guys
you beat up."

176
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.364 line:82%
Here.

177
00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.366 line:82%
Use this.

178
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:49.871 line:82%
I feel like just staring at the screen.

179
00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.082 line:82%
I have a dream.

180
00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:55.460 line:82%
Keep doing your thing
with your heroines.

181
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.796 line:82%
I've been your fan forever.

182
00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.257 line:82%
I think you owe me a dance.

183
00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.591 line:82%
We'll have a blast.

184
00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:04.761 line:82%
No one will tell who is Senior,
who is Junior. Hit it!

185
00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:24.966 line:82%
One last thing before I go.

186
00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:30.555 line:82%
Whatever and wherever I am today...

187
00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.351 line:82%
It's all thanks to my fans.

188
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.856 line:82%
Without my fans,
I'm nothing.

189
00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.779 line:82%
Brothers and sisters!

190
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.615 line:82%
The Virat act did not impress us.

191
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:51.826 line:82%
The Katrina act didn't impress us either.

192
00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:54.746 line:82%
This year like every other year,

193
00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:57.582 line:82%
the Western Union,
"moving money for better"

194
00:15:57.624 --> 00:16:02.337 line:82%
Super Star competition's trophy
goes to our very own...

195
00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.963 line:82%
Gaurav Chandna!

196
00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.389 line:82%
Give him a big hand!

197
00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:29.030 line:82%
I want to thank my mommy.

198
00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.074 line:82%
My papa.

199
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.160 line:82%
My god,

200
00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:38.331 line:82%
the greatest actor in the world,

201
00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.874 line:82%
the Aryan Khanna!

202
00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.519 line:82%
If you must, then go!

203
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.897 line:82%
But why travel without a ticket?

204
00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.066 line:82%
-Go later.
-Later?

205
00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:10.447 line:82%
Aryan's birthday is in two days,
and I must wait to buy a ticket?

206
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:14.117 line:82%
The inspector will catch you
and beat you up.

207
00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:18.788 line:82%
Remind her how Aryan traveled
to Mumbai for the first time.

208
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.166 line:82%
-WT.
-Without ticket!

209
00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:24.919 line:82%
You want to give him the trophy?
Mail it to him!

210
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.297 line:82%
Papa, count the money again.

211
00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:30.091 line:82%
Fake fans cheer him from afar,

212
00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:35.054 line:82%
but I'll hug him and hand him
the trophy myself.

213
00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.599 line:82%
-Like this.
-Have you gone mad?

214
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.768 line:82%
Control the boy.

215
00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.936 line:82%
Here. 20,000.

216
00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.480 line:82%
Did you spit on the bills?

217
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:48.067 line:82%
Socks, in the outside pocket.
Underwear, inside the bag.

218
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:51.070 line:82%
Any extra underwear? I'll have
no time to wash them.

219
00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.616 line:82%
Here. Give this to him
from your papa and me.

220
00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:55.867 line:82%
Sohan halwa.

221
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:59.871 line:82%
Tell him your father got it
especially for him.

222
00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:03.333 line:82%
-From Chandni Chowk.
-Why tell him? I'll show him.

223
00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:07.629 line:82%
I'll show Aryan a family selfie.
Come, we'll get the background.

224
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.257 line:82%
Mommy, hold the box.
I'll hold the trophy.

225
00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.218 line:82%
Papa, hide those undies.

226
00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.221 line:82%
-Cheese.
-Cheese!

227
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.973 line:82%
-Need a ride to the station?
-No, go to the store.

228
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.850 line:82%
-Can you manage?
-Sure.

229
00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:22.435 line:82%
Don't overstay at Aryan's.

230
00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:24.854 line:82%
I only have four days' leave,
it can't be extended.

231
00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:27.023 line:82%
Don't worry, papa.
Bye, mommy.

232
00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.483 line:82%
Be careful, son.

233
00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:31.194 line:82%
Hey! Hey!

234
00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.446 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-Hi!

235
00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:36.063 line:82%
Did your parents kick you out?

236
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.203 line:82%
You keep dreaming
about moving to America.

237
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.664 line:82%
I'm off to meet Aryan,
face-to-face.

238
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:45.083 line:82%
You told Aryan about it?

239
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:48.628 line:82%
He's my Aryan, not America.
No visa needed.

240
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.839 line:82%
I'm going to America to make a new life.

241
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.924 line:82%
You'll get nothing meeting Aryan.

242
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.345 line:82%
Forget it, you wouldn't understand.

243
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.524 line:82%
Hello, sir. Hello, ma'am.

244
00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.365 line:82%
Your ice cream.

245
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:03.036 line:82%
Sir, can I get a vegetarian meal?

246
00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:04.120 line:82%
Seat number?

247
00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.543 line:82%
100.

248
00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:13.880 line:82%
Right away.

249
00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:20.553 line:82%
If you want to stretch your legs
or your back, let me know.

250
00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:24.307 line:82%
It's only one night.
We'll adjust.

251
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.191 line:82%
Allow me. Go ahead.

252
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:41.240 line:82%
Let me put his plate down.
Don't worry.

253
00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.368 line:82%
You don't have to worry.

254
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.302 line:82%
We're coming.

255
00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:08.059 line:82%
No ticket?

256
00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:12.939 line:82%
Sir, it's a long story.
Let me explain.

257
00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:17.276 line:82%
I'll do the explaining.
Call Ratlam police station.

258
00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:20.571 line:82%
Let him spend two days inside.
No more WT traveling.

259
00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.366 line:82%
Sir, you don't get it.
I could've bought the ticket.

260
00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:26.703 line:82%
-I want to travel without one.
-Come with me.

261
00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:27.745 line:82%
What are you doing?

262
00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.914 line:82%
I'm not a thief or a criminal.

263
00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.250 line:82%
You see, tomorrow is
Aryan Khanna's birthday.

264
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.252 line:82%
If I get there late,
it's all for nothing.

265
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.588 line:82%
-Aryan Khanna?
-Right! He went to Mumbai WT.

266
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.382 line:82%
Stayed at the Hotel Delite,
room number 205.

267
00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:42.677 line:82%
I'll be staying there too.
Get the picture?

268
00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:45.555 line:82%
Let me get to Mumbai.
You won't lose anything.

269
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:48.558 line:82%
Here's the ticket money.
Keep it.

270
00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.309 line:82%
-But I'll travel WT.
-Shut up!

271
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:51.894 line:82%
You need a good slap.

272
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:55.314 line:82%
Take him. He won't listen.

273
00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:57.567 line:82%
Damn you!

274
00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.402 line:82%
Take me to Mumbai or I'll jump!

275
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.950 line:82%
You'll be answering the cops all night.

276
00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:08.077 line:82%
You want to die?
Get back inside!

277
00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:11.039 line:82%
If I can't see Aryan Khanna
on his birthday,

278
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.749 line:82%
there's no point in living!

279
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.460 line:82%
Don't lose your head over
these movie stars.

280
00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:18.171 line:82%
He may be a movie star to you,
but he's special to me!

281
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:20.339 line:82%
Give me your hand or you'll die!

282
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:22.675 line:82%
-Will you take me to Mumbai?
-Okay! Okay! Give me your hand.

283
00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:26.387 line:82%
-One veg meal?
-Done! Give me your hand!

284
00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:29.390 line:82%
Okay, hold me.

285
00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:40.485 line:82%
Is he a relative?
Do you really know him?

286
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:44.197 line:82%
Is he family?
What are you to Aryan Khanna?

287
00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:48.076 line:82%
A fan.

288
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:14.852 line:82%
Room 205 is occupied.

289
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:17.647 line:82%
Why? I had a reservation.

00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:19.649 line:82%
There are no reservations here.

291
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.777 line:82%
First come, first serve.
Pay cash, take the key.

292
00:23:28.032 --> 00:23:30.952 line:82%
I'll pay double,
but only for room 205.

293
00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:35.414 line:82%
If you don't give it to me,
you'll see what I do.

294
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:44.132 line:82%
Hey, boy! Move the stuff

The press over there.

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:29.904 line:82%
Let them come in.

305
00:25:29.946 --> 00:25:31.864 line:82%

Thank you.

308
00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:43.334 line:82%
These two-faced fans.

309
00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:47.797 line:82%
They moan about his films, and
come here to pose with him.

310
00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:50.049 line:82%
Look at them.

311
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:52.718 line:82%
-You can't go there.
-I'm not like them!

312
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.597 line:82%
I'm not one of them.
Those FB types are fake fans.

313
00:25:56.639 --> 00:25:58.891 line:82%
I'm Gaurav! Gaurav Chandna!

314
00:25:58.933 --> 00:26:03.229 line:82%
I've come from Delhi.
WT. Rajdhani Express.

315
00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:04.522 line:82%
Guess where I'm staying?

316
00:26:06.232 --> 00:26:07.400 line:82%
Guess!

317
00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:10.194 line:82%
Guess! Guess!

318
00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:13.281 line:82%
Hotel Delite. Room number 205.
I'm staying at the same place.

319
00:26:13.322 --> 00:26:15.783 line:82%
Don't you get it?

320
00:26:15.825 --> 00:26:17.660 line:82%
I'll show you magic.

321
00:26:17.702 --> 00:26:19.620 line:82%
You'll enjoy it. Look!

322
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:26.836 line:82%
When you count the night stars

323
00:26:26.877 --> 00:26:29.547 line:82%
and yearn to etch her name
on every star,

324
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:33.426 line:82%
you know you're in love.

325
00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:35.219 line:82%
When her breath is carried
by the breeze...

326
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:37.263 line:82%
Let the press go.

327
00:26:37.305 --> 00:26:39.932 line:82%
...you know you're in love.

328
00:26:39.974 --> 00:26:41.934 line:82%
When you turn back as you walk ahead...

329
00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:43.602 line:82%
Check the press IDs.

330
00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:45.438 line:82%
Go inside.

331
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:49.191 line:82%
-Let me in! Let me in!
-Not you! Don't you get it?

332
00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:52.278 line:82%
I want to show him my trophy.

333
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.989 line:82%
l just want him to see it.
Then I'll be gone.

334
00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:00.619 line:82%
Moron!

335
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:03.205 line:82%
If Aryan ever hears that you hit me,

336
00:27:03.247 --> 00:27:04.797 line:82%
he'll beat you up.

337
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.878 line:82%
It's okay. It's nothing.

338
00:27:52.463 --> 00:27:56.384 line:82%
Aryan Khanna!

339
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:01.639 line:82%
Aryan Khanna!

340
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:08.396 line:82%
Aryan Khanna!

341
00:28:18.531 --> 00:28:22.743 line:82%
Mommy sent you special halwa.

342
00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:27.039 line:82%
And this trophy for your birthday!
Mommy sent special halwa!

343
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:32.086 line:82%
Aryan Khanna...

344
00:29:26.557 --> 00:29:28.392 line:82%
Hello, Mommy?

345
00:29:28.434 --> 00:29:29.485 line:82%
I'm fine.

346
00:29:30.895 --> 00:29:34.398 line:82%
Aryan is fine, too.
I haven't met him yet.

347
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.442 line:82%
You're talking to me like a child, Mommy.

348
00:29:36.484 --> 00:29:39.487 line:82%
He's a superstar.
How can I just meet him?

349
00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:42.156 line:82%
There are thousands of people
here to meet him.

350
00:29:42.198 --> 00:29:45.618 line:82%
They've built a 50 ft. wall
in front of him.

351
00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:48.412 line:82%
The poor guy is stuck alone behind it.

352
00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:52.208 line:82%
Scream as loudly as you want,
he can't hear.

353
00:29:55.544 --> 00:29:58.464 line:82%
I'm hanging up.
I'll call later.

354
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:14.021 line:82%
They say common sense deserts
a man in bad times.

355
00:30:14.063 --> 00:30:15.064 line:82%
SLAP ECHO

356
00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:17.149 line:82%
It seems that's Aryan Khanna's fate now.

357
00:30:17.191 --> 00:30:20.945 line:82%
In his twilight years,
his films are bombing.

358
00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:24.490 line:82%
No surprise that he's on edge
and snappy.

359
00:30:24.532 --> 00:30:26.325 line:82%
On his 48th birthday,

360
00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:28.244 line:82%
he showed his irritation

361
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:30.871 line:82%
through his gift to Sid Kapoor.

362
00:30:30.913 --> 00:30:34.083 line:82%
No star had matched Aryan
till now,

363
00:30:34.124 --> 00:30:39.964 line:82%
but Sid Kapoor pulled the rug
from under his feet.

364
00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:45.052 line:82%
The party guests said Sid
Kapoor hinted

365
00:30:45.094 --> 00:30:48.430 line:82%
that Aryan Khanna's days
were over.

366
00:30:48.472 --> 00:30:54.228 line:82%
What did Kapoor tell Aryan Khanna
to make him hit him?

367
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.271 line:82%
SID'S REPLY

368
00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:56.689 line:82%
I went to wish him happy birthday.

369
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.899 line:82%
Look what he did to me!
Look at this!

370
00:30:58.941 --> 00:31:00.234 line:82%
This is totally not cool.

371
00:31:00.276 --> 00:31:03.612 line:82%
He's an elder. I respect him a lot.

372
00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:08.200 line:82%
I always say I've learned how to act
by watching his films.

373
00:31:08.242 --> 00:31:11.453 line:82%
I don't know why I make him insecure.

374
00:31:11.495 --> 00:31:14.206 line:82%
What will you do?
Take legal action?

375
00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:17.668 line:82%
I should.
I'll talk to my legal team.

376
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.836 line:82%
Let's see what they say.

377
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:21.839 line:82%
It's my duty to do something,

378
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.302 line:82%
so no newcomer is mistreated
by a senior star.

379
00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:27.928 line:82%
Thank you.

380
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.722 line:82%
That's all I want to say.

381
00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:32.933 line:82%
We'll talk after
I've consulted my legal team.

382
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:46.739 line:82%
Liar! Cheat!

383
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.396 line:82%
Playing the good boy on TV.
Anyone can see through you.

384
00:31:51.994 --> 00:31:53.787 line:82%
You think he's insecure?

385
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:56.874 line:82%
He's seen off dozens like you.

386
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.543 line:82%
No one has touched Aryan Khanna
for 25 years.

387
00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:02.046 line:82%
Do your worst, sonny!

388
00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:07.009 line:82%
No one can touch him.
Just you wait.

389
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.733 line:82%
Cut!

390
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:32.618 line:82%
Great shot.

391
00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.661 line:82%
Superb!

392
00:32:33.702 --> 00:32:35.621 line:82%
-You liked it?
-Fantastic.

393
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.088 line:82%
Love you! Love you!

394
00:32:46.882 --> 00:32:49.677 line:82%
Sid Kapoor! You swallowed
Aryan Khanna whole!

395
00:32:52.346 --> 00:32:53.430 line:82%
Excuse me.

396
00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:55.641 line:82%
What delivery!

397
00:32:55.683 --> 00:32:56.767 line:82%
What delivery!

398
00:32:58.018 --> 00:33:02.564 line:82%
You've destroyed Aryan Khanna.
Blew him away.

399
00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:05.359 line:82%
I am your biggest fan, sir.

400
00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:07.778 line:82%
At the contest back home--

401
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.239 line:82%
Unfortunately, I look like Aryan,
but I always impersonate you.

402
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.825 line:82%
I always win first place, sir!
I've even won a trophy.

403
00:33:12.866 --> 00:33:14.993 line:82%
I love you, sir.
I love you very much. I...

404
00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:17.871 line:82%
Let me show you my trophy, sir.
Please see my trophy...

405
00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:19.998 line:82%
You let the girls through.
Let the boys go as well, please.

406
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.751 line:82%
-Let him come.
-He says yes. Thank you, sir!

407
00:33:22.793 --> 00:33:24.586 line:82%
Sorry. Give me space.

408
00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:27.256 line:82%
Thank you, sir!
Thank you very much, sir!

409
00:33:27.297 --> 00:33:29.091 line:82%
-I'll show you my act?
-Sure!

410
00:33:29.133 --> 00:33:30.968 line:82%
Okay. All right.

411
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:40.561 line:82%
The mind always outsmarts
the face, Mr. Singhania.

412
00:33:40.602 --> 00:33:43.272 line:82%
You can imitate someone.

413
00:33:43.313 --> 00:33:46.442 line:82%
But you can't imitate his mind.

414
00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:53.407 line:82%
When all doors are shut,
there's a knock at the mind's door.

415
00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:58.078 line:82%
And when that door opens,
you see a new road.

416
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.791 line:82%
I have walked that road to you, Singhania.

417
00:34:02.833 --> 00:34:07.087 line:82%
And through that very door
you shall walk to your peril.

418
00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:11.425 line:82%
Too good, fan.
You're too good, man.

419
00:34:11.467 --> 00:34:13.927 line:82%
Well done, fan.
Well done.

420
00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:15.512 line:82%
-Thank you! Thank you!
-Hey, hey, hey!

421
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:17.723 line:82%
Relax, man!
Just calm down.

422
00:34:17.765 --> 00:34:19.600 line:82%
It's okay.

423
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:22.853 line:82%
I have the same jacket
you're wearing.

424
00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:25.063 line:82%
-That's good. Very nice.
-One chance, sir! One chance!

425
00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:27.733 line:82%
-It's his lunch break now.
-One chance, sir.

426
00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:32.654 line:82%
Santosh, bring me the salad
in half an hour.

427
00:34:32.696 --> 00:34:35.574 line:82%
Come on, fan!

428
00:34:35.616 --> 00:34:37.534 line:82%
Hear that?

429
00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:41.747 line:82%
-Sit down.
-No, thank you.

430
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:48.295 line:82%
Sir, a small question
from a fan.

431
00:34:48.337 --> 00:34:50.964 line:82%
Why fight with Aryan Khanna?

432
00:34:51.006 --> 00:34:54.301 line:82%
Why bother with the police
and police reports?

433
00:34:54.343 --> 00:34:57.721 line:82%
That's nothing, bro.
I'll drag him to court.

434
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:00.974 line:82%
Allow me.

435
00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:02.726 line:82%
Aryan Khanna's time is up.

436
00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:06.980 line:82%
-I'll wring your neck.
-Santosh!

437
00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:11.985 line:82%
-Santosh!
-To hell with Santosh.

438
00:35:13.153 --> 00:35:16.782 line:82%
Shut up! No one is coming.

439
00:35:16.824 --> 00:35:18.992 line:82%
Close your mouth.

440
00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:20.994 line:82%
Shut up! Or I'll--

441
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:23.121 line:82%
Now listen... sit quietly--

442
00:35:23.163 --> 00:35:24.832 line:82%
Listen carefully!

443
00:35:24.873 --> 00:35:26.667 line:82%
Don't open your mouth again
to insult Aryan.

444
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:31.004 line:82%
One peep and I'll crush
your chocolate face with the wrapper.

445
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:38.887 line:82%
No fan will look at you again.

446
00:35:38.929 --> 00:35:43.058 line:82%
Since you like to spout your wisdom
on TV, look at my camera.

447
00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:47.020 line:82%
Read! Here's the script.
Learn the lines.

448
00:35:47.062 --> 00:35:49.481 line:82%
Do your crappy acting.
Come on!

449
00:35:54.403 --> 00:35:56.613 line:82%
Your damn phone never stops ringing.

450
00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:03.537 line:82%
-Answer you phone later.
-Sorry!

451
00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:05.080 line:82%
Now, read it!

452
00:36:08.083 --> 00:36:09.626 line:82%
Start.

453
00:36:13.422 --> 00:36:14.506 line:82%
It's in Hindi, dude.

454
00:36:18.218 --> 00:36:21.221 line:82%
You're a Hindi film hero
and you can't read Hindi?

455
00:36:21.263 --> 00:36:25.642 line:82%
Where do they find you guys?

456
00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:28.979 line:82%
What do you film people say?

457
00:36:29.021 --> 00:36:30.147 line:82%
Action!

458
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:31.773 line:82%
Dear Aryan, sir,

459
00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:33.817 line:82%
I'm really very sorry.

460
00:36:33.859 --> 00:36:36.486 line:82%
My statement to the press
was all lies.

461
00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:39.990 line:82%
I wanted to ruin your name.

462
00:36:40.032 --> 00:36:42.826 line:82%
No one can take your place.
You're the best.

463
00:36:42.868 --> 00:36:47.789 line:82%
The greatest, the most timeless,
super-duper star.

464
00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:50.584 line:82%
I apologize once again.

465
00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:53.629 line:82%
Think of me as your kid brother
and forgive me.

466
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.632 line:82%
Why won't he play with you?
Shall I tell him to?

467
00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:59.885 line:82%
Dad, he bullies me.

468
00:36:59.927 --> 00:37:02.179 line:82%
He bullies you because
he's scared of you.

469
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.223 line:82%
He thinks you'll win.
We'll cheat!

470
00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:07.267 line:82%
-Dhruv, let's play.
-Dad, come on.

471
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:08.769 line:82%
Play with Isha.
I've trained her.

472
00:37:13.482 --> 00:37:16.860 line:82%
-I am so sorry.
-Dad, you made me lose a point.

473
00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:18.570 line:82%
Now she's ahead of you.
Try and win.

474
00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:19.696 line:82%
Go for it.

475
00:37:21.907 --> 00:37:23.116 line:82%
I'm glad Sid realized his mistake.

476
00:37:23.158 --> 00:37:25.869 line:82%
He's a great guy, young and new.

477
00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:27.871 line:82%
Glad it got sorted out.

478
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:32.501 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen,
last point, next point.

479
00:37:33.502 --> 00:37:35.907 line:82%
Nothing is sorted,
it's a game.

480
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:40.592 line:82%
The apology. Say sorry.
It's all a game.

481
00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:43.887 line:82%
But, Aryan, please.
You should've controlled yourself.

482
00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:45.305 line:82%
I tried very hard.

483
00:37:45.347 --> 00:37:47.349 line:82%
I gave him one slap, more like a pat.

484
00:37:48.867 --> 00:37:50.769 line:82%
See the scandal it's created.

485
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.856 line:82%
If someone comes to my house,
drinks my expensive wine,

486
00:37:54.898 --> 00:37:57.693 line:82%
and flirts with my wife,
should I just stand by and watch?

487
00:37:58.694 --> 00:38:02.175 line:82%
You have no time.
Let someone else flirt with me.

488
00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:05.075 line:82%
Actually, you're right. Yeah.

489
00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:09.123 line:82%
But not this moron.

490
00:38:10.664 --> 00:38:14.334 line:82%
The video has gone viral.
Social media is buzzing.

491
00:38:14.376 --> 00:38:18.171 line:82%
Join us for the stock market news
after this short break.

492
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.113 line:82%
Aryan, wake up!
Wake up! Wake up, Aryan!

493
00:38:43.155 --> 00:38:44.531 line:82%
What happened?

494
00:38:44.573 --> 00:38:46.950 line:82%
Did you sleep here all night?

495
00:38:46.992 --> 00:38:50.037 line:82%
I was reading a script. It was
so good that I dozed off.

496
00:38:52.039 --> 00:38:54.875 line:82%
Sunaina is here. She has something
that'll wake you up.

497
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:57.502 line:82%
-Good morning, Aryan.
-It's too early, Sunaina.

498
00:38:57.544 --> 00:39:00.672 line:82%
I know. I'm really sorry,
but I have to tell you something.

499
00:39:00.714 --> 00:39:03.383 line:82%
-Are you pregnant?
-Shut up, Aryan.

500
00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:05.135 line:82%
Watch this.

501
00:39:05.177 --> 00:39:09.139 line:82%
Come on. Look here and say
your lines. Hurry!

502
00:39:09.181 --> 00:39:10.515 line:82%
Dear Aryan, sir...

503
00:39:10.557 --> 00:39:13.393 line:82%
Look here!
Look at the camera!

504
00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:16.541 line:82%
Okay, okay. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

505
00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:20.317 line:82%
-Come on.
-Did Aryan send you?

506
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:21.651 line:82%
Aryan has nothing to do with it.

507
00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:24.237 line:82%
Do as you're told.
Look at the camera.

508
00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:29.117 line:82%
If you want cash, take it.
Just let me go, please. Please!

509
00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:31.578 line:82%
Cash? I'll give you cash.

510
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.206 line:82%
Stop! I'll do it.

511
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:37.334 line:82%
What will you do? Scum!

512
00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:57.521 line:82%
A fan.

513
00:39:57.562 --> 00:40:00.232 line:82%
He calls himself
Aryan Khanna, Jr.

514
00:40:00.273 --> 00:40:01.983 line:82%
He sent a Facebook message.

515
00:40:02.025 --> 00:40:06.404 line:82%
"A small birthday gift to the love
of my life, Aryan Khanna, Sr.

516
00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:10.033 line:82%
Call me once to thank me.
My life is set."

517
00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:22.045 line:82%
-Hello!
-Hello.

518
00:40:23.397 --> 00:40:25.882 line:82%
Aryan Khanna, Jr.?

519
00:40:26.883 --> 00:40:28.260 line:82%
You calling from Aryan's house?

520
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:29.761 line:82%
Yes.

521
00:40:31.346 --> 00:40:34.975 line:82%
Where is Aryan Khanna, Sr.?

522
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:39.187 line:82%
He's busy right now.
He asked me to call you.

523
00:40:39.229 --> 00:40:43.191 line:82%
How come he's so busy?
No time to talk to his Junior?

524
00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:44.609 line:82%
I did so much for him.

525
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:47.612 line:82%
I came to the house
on his birthday, the crowd...

526
00:40:47.654 --> 00:40:49.865 line:82%
Yeah, yeah, hello.

527
00:40:52.742 --> 00:40:53.785 line:82%
Aryan?

528
00:40:56.538 --> 00:40:58.498 line:82%
Aryan Khanna?

529
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.376 line:82%
Gaurav on this side.
Your fan, your Junior.

530
00:41:02.502 --> 00:41:03.879 line:82%
Where are you?

531
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.506 line:82%
Just guess!

532
00:41:10.844 --> 00:41:14.764 line:82%
Delite hotel, in your room.

533
00:41:14.806 --> 00:41:16.141 line:82%
Room no. 205. Charni Road.

534
00:41:16.183 --> 00:41:17.475 line:82%
Remember?

535
00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:22.439 line:82%
But if you're calling to say
thank you, it won't do.

536
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.524 line:82%
I deserve a hug from my brother.

537
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.278 line:82%
-You want to see me?
-Sure!

538
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.488 line:82%
I made a big scandal just to meet you.

539
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:34.868 line:82%
Okay, wait there.
I'll send a car to pick you up.

540
00:41:37.287 --> 00:41:38.955 line:82%
Done, Senior.

541
00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:43.877 line:82%
Thank you! Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much!

542
00:41:43.919 --> 00:41:44.920 line:82%
Hello?

543
00:41:47.172 --> 00:41:48.757 line:82%
Mind blasting.

544
00:41:48.798 --> 00:41:51.676 line:82%
Really?

545
00:41:51.718 --> 00:41:54.179 line:82%
Take a taxi.

546
00:41:54.221 --> 00:41:57.682 line:82%
You're going to Aryan Khanna's.
Don't go by auto-rickshaw.

547
00:41:57.724 --> 00:42:00.810 line:82%
He's sending me his personal car.

548
00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:02.938 line:82%
He's invited me home.

549
00:42:02.979 --> 00:42:05.023 line:82%
Don't forget to take pictures!

550
00:42:05.065 --> 00:42:09.152 line:82%
If he offers you any food,
no pouncing on it like a pauper.

551
00:42:09.194 --> 00:42:11.112 line:82%
Food? I'm not going
for the food.

552
00:42:11.154 --> 00:42:14.032 line:82%
I'm going there to hug him.

553
00:42:14.074 --> 00:42:18.828 line:82%
Tell him to wear the clothes
I had made for him at Diwali.

554
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.707 line:82%
-Make sure he takes the trophy.
-Like he'd forget!

555
00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:27.796 line:82%
-Say hello from me.
-And me, too.

556
00:42:27.837 --> 00:42:28.922 line:82%
Okay. I'll tell him.

557
00:42:28.964 --> 00:42:31.758 line:82%
Call me once you've met him.

558
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.552 line:82%
The car's here.
Call you later, bye-bye.

559
00:42:35.804 --> 00:42:37.639 line:82%
The car is there.

560
00:42:42.102 --> 00:42:43.436 line:82%
Hello.

561
00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:51.611 line:82%
Are you the driver?

562
00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:53.697 line:82%
Aryan Khanna, Jr.?

563
00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:55.448 line:82%
Did you pull a fast one
on Sid Kapoor?

564
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:59.327 line:82%
No. You're mistaken.

565
00:43:01.162 --> 00:43:02.706 line:82%
Did Sid Kapoor send you?

566
00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.582 line:82%
I'll tell you later.
Come on.

567
00:43:04.624 --> 00:43:07.919 line:82%
I'm meeting Aryan.
I won't go anywhere.

568
00:43:07.961 --> 00:43:10.839 line:82%
-Like hell you won't.
-I won't come.

569
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.924 line:82%
Come on! Come on!

570
00:43:12.966 --> 00:43:14.342 line:82%
Don't touch me.

571
00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:17.595 line:82%
No touching!

572
00:43:24.978 --> 00:43:25.979 line:82%
Let me go!

573
00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:41.990 line:82%
Stop!

574
00:46:03.803 --> 00:46:06.556 line:82%
Catch me if you can!

575
00:46:06.598 --> 00:46:09.726 line:82%
-Stop, you punk!
-Please don't hit me.

576
00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:18.026 line:82%
Don't hit him hard.
We have orders.

577
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.618 line:82%
Come on. Let's go.

578
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:29.662 line:82%
Let me call Aryan Khanna.

579
00:46:29.704 --> 00:46:30.830 line:82%
Where are you taking me?

580
00:46:37.504 --> 00:46:39.881 line:82%
Sid Kapoor is evil.
Don't get mixed up with him.

581
00:46:39.923 --> 00:46:41.007 line:82%
Shut up!

582
00:46:41.049 --> 00:46:44.969 line:82%
I did it for Aryan Khanna!
His problem is my problem!

583
00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:53.603 line:82%
If Aryan hears about this,
he'll skin you alive!

584
00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:58.024 line:82%
Stop!

585
00:46:58.066 --> 00:47:02.362 line:82%
Think it over.
We'll be back. Let's go.

586
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.349 line:82%
Good evening, sir.
Please come in.

587
00:47:46.364 --> 00:47:49.617 line:82%
We asked him
why he made the video.

588
00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:51.953 line:82%
He says he'll talk only to you.

589
00:47:51.995 --> 00:47:54.831 line:82%
You told us to go easy on him.

590
00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:57.834 line:82%
-We barely touched him.
-Thank you.

591
00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:00.336 line:82%
-Usman.
-Yes, sir?

592
00:48:01.796 --> 00:48:03.840 line:82%
This is for his expenses.

593
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:05.592 line:82%
Keep him here two days.

594
00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:08.094 line:82%
Get him a ticket to Delhi.
Take him to the station.

595
00:48:08.136 --> 00:48:11.556 line:82%
And like I said before,
don't beat him up too badly,

596
00:48:11.598 --> 00:48:12.765 line:82%
just enough to scare him.

597
00:48:12.807 --> 00:48:15.092 line:82%
No one should hear about this.

598
00:48:16.019 --> 00:48:20.064 line:82%
No police record,
no video statement, please.

599
00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:21.733 line:82%
Sure, sir. Sure.

600
00:48:21.774 --> 00:48:24.008 line:82%
Where is he?

601
00:48:25.194 --> 00:48:28.197 line:82%
-I want to meet him alone. Yeah.
-Okay.

602
00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:29.866 line:82%
-You stay here.
-Yeah.

603
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.464 line:82%
Gaurav.

604
00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:48.885 line:82%
Gaurav!

605
00:49:06.194 --> 00:49:07.612 line:82%
Senior...

606
00:49:07.654 --> 00:49:09.405 line:82%
You're here.

607
00:49:10.406 --> 00:49:12.992 line:82%
I knew you'd come.

608
00:49:13.034 --> 00:49:15.953 line:82%
They hit me and hit me.

609
00:49:15.995 --> 00:49:18.665 line:82%
They broke my bones.

610
00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:23.586 line:82%
I protected my face.

611
00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:26.756 line:82%
It's Aryan Khanna's face.
Nothing must happen to it.

612
00:49:33.513 --> 00:49:37.225 line:82%
See? It's the same face.

613
00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:41.729 line:82%
Everyone calls me
Aryan Khanna, Jr.

614
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:44.691 line:82%
But I say... there's only one
Aryan Khanna.

615
00:49:45.692 --> 00:49:47.318 line:82%
-Relax.
-Let's go.

616
00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:50.571 line:82%
It's okay.

617
00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.413 line:82%
I impersonate you at the yearly
Super Star competition.

618
00:50:00.248 --> 00:50:01.332 line:82%
I always win first prize.

619
00:50:04.711 --> 00:50:07.714 line:82%
The bastards took my bag.
My trophy was in it.

620
00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:09.132 line:82%
I brought it to show you.

621
00:50:13.678 --> 00:50:15.346 line:82%
I could show you my act.

622
00:50:26.733 --> 00:50:29.652 line:82%
I'm nervous in front of you.

623
00:50:29.694 --> 00:50:31.404 line:82%
It's all right. Sit.

624
00:50:31.446 --> 00:50:35.158 line:82%
There's no audience here.

625
00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:36.451 line:82%
Their screaming
and cheering helps.

626
00:50:36.492 --> 00:50:38.661 line:82%
-Are you from Delhi?
-West Delhi.

627
00:50:38.703 --> 00:50:40.580 line:82%
You're from Rajender Nagar,
I'm from Inder Vihar.

628
00:50:40.621 --> 00:50:43.499 line:82%
Two traffic lights from the TV
tower, near DAV Park.

629
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:45.835 line:82%
Listen to me carefully.

630
00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:49.046 line:82%
You did something nasty.

631
00:50:49.957 --> 00:50:51.008 line:82%
It's a crime.

632
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:56.012 line:82%
A crime in the eyes of the law.
Love in your eyes, no?

633
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:58.806 line:82%
Not love, it's stupidity.

634
00:51:01.434 --> 00:51:03.186 line:82%
Do you have any family?

635
00:51:03.227 --> 00:51:07.036 line:82%
There's Papa, Mommy...
and you, too.

636
00:51:07.857 --> 00:51:09.692 line:82%
Have you thought
what your parents would say?

637
00:51:09.734 --> 00:51:12.820 line:82%
They'd be sad seeing you
in that sadistic video.

638
00:51:12.862 --> 00:51:16.491 line:82%
Why would we show it to them?
It was for you.

639
00:51:16.532 --> 00:51:18.618 line:82%
Did you like my birthday gift?

640
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:21.662 line:82%
Sid Kapoor?
I beat the crap out of him.

641
00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:28.211 line:82%
I don't understand how the cops
discovered our little secret.

642
00:51:29.712 --> 00:51:31.108 line:82%
"Our"?

643
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.062 line:82%
There is no "our."

644
00:51:37.136 --> 00:51:39.180 line:82%
The police brought you here
on my orders.

645
00:51:40.473 --> 00:51:42.892 line:82%
You made a mistake.
You had to be punished.

646
00:51:42.934 --> 00:51:45.186 line:82%
So you won't mess up again.

647
00:51:48.439 --> 00:51:52.652 line:82%
On your orders?
I did so much for you.

648
00:51:55.571 --> 00:51:57.615 line:82%
Who are you
to do anything for me?

649
00:52:00.993 --> 00:52:02.368 line:82%
I'm your fan.

650
00:52:03.913 --> 00:52:06.078 line:82%
-You're my star.
-Fan? So you do as you please?

651
00:52:07.166 --> 00:52:09.752 line:82%
Beat people up?
Kill them?

652
00:52:11.003 --> 00:52:14.549 line:82%
If it was necessary,
I could kill for you.

653
00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:19.887 line:82%
You're not my fan.

654
00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:24.225 line:82%
Don't say that.

655
00:52:24.267 --> 00:52:26.936 line:82%
I risked my life to meet you.

656
00:52:26.978 --> 00:52:30.189 line:82%
I hit Sid Kapoor a little,
so you'd meet me.

657
00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.109 line:82%
What did I want in return?

658
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.487 line:82%
To see you, a few photos,
an autograph. That's all.

659
00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:40.867 line:82%
Can't you spare five minutes
of your life?

660
00:52:40.908 --> 00:52:43.160 line:82%
It's my life.

661
00:52:43.202 --> 00:52:46.455 line:82%
Why should I give you
even five seconds?

662
00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:17.653 line:82%
Whoever and wherever
I am today, my stardom...

663
00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:22.575 line:82%
It's all thanks to my fans.

664
00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:27.079 line:82%
If it weren't for my fans...

665
00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:29.790 line:82%
I'd be nothing.

666
00:53:43.054 --> 00:53:46.194 line:82%
Gaurav makes Aryan.

667
00:53:47.934 --> 00:53:51.729 line:82%
Without Gaurav...
Aryan is nothing.

668
00:53:55.524 --> 00:53:57.652 line:82%
Now you listen carefully.

669
00:53:57.693 --> 00:54:01.906 line:82%
When the police let you go,
go straight to Delhi, okay?

670
00:54:01.948 --> 00:54:03.491 line:82%
I'll forget all about Gaurav.

671
00:54:03.532 --> 00:54:06.702 line:82%
And you'll forget
you ever met Aryan.

672
00:54:08.287 --> 00:54:10.498 line:82%
Live your life.
I'll live mine.

673
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:16.128 line:82%
This is your final warning.
Okay?

674
00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:32.687 line:82%
Forget it.
You wouldn't understand.

675
00:55:46.302 --> 00:55:49.013 line:82%
Hello, Mommy.
I'll be home soon.

676
00:55:49.055 --> 00:55:50.848 line:82%
-Everything okay?
-Everything is fine.

677
00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:52.183 line:82%
Why didn't you take my call?

678
00:55:52.224 --> 00:55:53.768 line:82%
I was busy, so I couldn't take it.

679
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:56.353 line:82%
-Gaurav, we're worried about you.
-Don't worry.

680
00:55:56.395 --> 00:56:00.024 line:82%
-You'll be home soon?
-Tell Papa to mind the cyber cafe.

681
00:56:00.066 --> 00:56:03.277 line:82%
-Are you eating well?
-The food is fine here. Okay, bye.

682
00:56:06.197 --> 00:56:07.406 line:82%
Thank you.

683
00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:09.593 line:82%
Come, hero.
The boss wants you.

684
00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:18.144 line:82%
Whatever happened, happened.
Put it behind you. Right?

685
00:57:18.185 --> 00:57:20.354 line:82%
Thank you, man.
I made a mistake. Sorry.

686
00:57:52.011 --> 00:57:55.598 line:82%
Gaurav! Hey!

687
00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:58.058 line:82%
Did you hug Aryan Khanna?

688
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:14.491 line:82%
He didn't meet you? Didn't have
five minutes to spare?

689
00:58:14.533 --> 00:58:16.493 line:82%
Don't feel bad.

690
00:58:16.535 --> 00:58:20.122 line:82%
It's not my loss, it's his!

691
00:58:20.164 --> 00:58:22.416 line:82%
He's happy where he is.
I'm happy where I am.

692
00:58:22.458 --> 00:58:24.501 line:82%
It's okay! Really!

693
00:58:26.712 --> 00:58:28.714 line:82%
Mommy, make me some
rice and beans tonight.

694
00:58:59.203 --> 00:59:02.289 line:82%
Hello, auntie.
You're moving out?

695
00:59:02.331 --> 00:59:05.000 line:82%
Who knows what this boy wants?

696
00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:07.294 line:82%
Got a good price?

697
00:59:07.337 --> 00:59:10.297 line:82%
Don't worry, Papa.
I'll invest wisely.

698
00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.655 line:82%
I wasted too much time on Aryan.

699
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:15.844 line:82%
The store is sold, Mommy.
Let's go.

700
00:59:15.886 --> 00:59:17.972 line:82%
Hurry. You coming?

701
00:59:18.013 --> 00:59:20.182 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Okay, come on.

702
00:59:20.224 --> 00:59:21.433 line:82%
Is everything okay, auntie?

703
01:00:57.446 --> 01:01:01.075 line:82%
Fans chase stars.

704
01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:03.369 line:82%
Now a star will chase a fan.

705
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.082 line:82%
Whenever Aryan Khanna's name
is mentioned...

706
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.586 line:82%
it'll be in the same breath
as Gaurav Chandna's.

707
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:32.856 line:82%
Good morning, London!

708
01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:36.402 line:82%
Welcome to Bollywood Café,
98.1 FM.

709
01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.237 line:82%
Do you know what's special
about the weekend?

710
01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:40.989 line:82%
Guys, this weekend is the
"Aryan Khanna Reloaded" show,

711
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:42.950 line:82%
presented by Hyundai.

712
01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:45.786 line:82%
Stars have a great life.

713
01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:49.373 line:82%
I want a life like Aryan's.
Full-on jet set!

714
01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:50.582 line:82%
One day in London,

715
01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:53.794 line:82%
then he's off to Dubrovnik
for the grand Bhutiani wedding...

716
01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:55.587 line:82%
And then comes back
for the London show.

717
01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.047 line:82%
Wow! Well, by the way, guys,

718
01:01:57.089 --> 01:01:59.883 line:82%
did you know London is
one of his favorite places?

719
01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:02.719 line:82%
In fact, he considers it
his second home after Mumbai.

720
01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:07.766 line:82%
We have some good news
and some bad news.

721
01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:09.393 line:82%
The bad news first, obviously.

722
01:02:09.435 --> 01:02:12.354 line:82%
The Hyundai "Aryan Khanna Reloaded"
show is sold out.

723
01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:14.523 line:82%
Oh, no!
What's the good news?

724
01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:18.360 line:82%
We have 20 free tickets
for our listeners.

725
01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:21.780 line:82%
The first one to answer
my question correctly

726
01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:24.241 line:82%
wins a ticket to the show.

727
01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:28.662 line:82%
The question comes after
this beautiful song.

728
01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.551 line:82%
Here's your tickets.
Enjoy your visit.

729
01:02:44.303 --> 01:02:45.846 line:82%
-Hello, how can I help you?
-One ticket, please.

730
01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:50.142 line:82%
Enjoy your visit.

731
01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:42.402 line:82%
The real drama starts now.

732
01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:48.325 line:82%
Aryan Khanna!

733
01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.745 line:82%
Yes, yes, yes.
Thank you.

734
01:03:51.787 --> 01:03:53.330 line:82%
Tim, come in!
Tim!

735
01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:57.251 line:82%
Hi, everyone!
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

736
01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.127 line:82%
Thank you! All right!

737
01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:02.214 line:82%
Mr. Khanna, Tim Baker,
the manager.

738
01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:03.632 line:82%
Aryan Khanna, the actor.

739
01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.425 line:82%
I know who you are.

740
01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.427 line:82%
I hope it's not a bother.

741
01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.096 line:82%
Fans... never a bother.

742
01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:14.309 line:82%
Thank you!
Thank you very--

743
01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.562 line:82%
Sir, a photo
with your wax figure.

744
01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.438 line:82%
Of course!
And let me say this.

745
01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.774 line:82%
It's amazing, really.

746
01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:25.362 line:82%
You've come all the way to London
to take a photo with my wax figure.

747
01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:28.615 line:82%
Really, that's very sweet.
Is this better?

748
01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:29.866 line:82%
Here.

749
01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:31.201 line:82%
Better now?

750
01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:32.995 line:82%
Yeah!

751
01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:35.330 line:82%
But-- But let me warn you.

752
01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.624 line:82%
I was much younger then.

753
01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.042 line:82%
You like it?

754
01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.628 line:82%
Honestly?
It's very scary.

755
01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:45.340 line:82%
You tell me,
does he look like me?

756
01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:48.302 line:82%
-You look great in real life.
-Exactly, darling!

757
01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:52.014 line:82%
I agree.
What a fat nose he has!

758
01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:55.225 line:82%
My nose is tiny. See?

759
01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:57.311 line:82%
A fake face.

760
01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:58.854 line:82%
A fake smile.

761
01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.772 line:82%
All fake.

762
01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:02.490 line:82%
I don't smile like this.

763
01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:05.902 line:82%
Actually, nobody smiles like this.

764
01:05:07.696 --> 01:05:11.700 line:82%
His hair smells bad,
feels bad and looks bad.

765
01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:13.827 line:82%
Yeah? See?

766
01:05:13.869 --> 01:05:17.331 line:82%
In fact, I don't look like him at all.

767
01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.750 line:82%
This is a fake.

768
01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:22.336 line:82%
Aryan Khanna is a fake.

769
01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:25.964 line:82%
I want a refund!
Aryan Khanna is a fake!

770
01:05:26.006 --> 01:05:28.258 line:82%
Mr. Khanna? Mr. Khanna!

771
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.594 line:82%
This isn't right. You can't do this
to our property.

772
01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:34.806 line:82%
The white man claims
my face is his property.

773
01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.768 line:82%
Mr. Property Agent,
this is me. See?

774
01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.144 line:82%
My face, my property.

775
01:05:39.186 --> 01:05:41.897 line:82%
Stop right now and leave, sir.

776
01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.940 line:82%
I won't leave.

777
01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:45.108 line:82%
Hey, watch out, now.

778
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.860 line:82%
-Okay, okay.
-Mister, let's go.

779
01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:47.903 line:82%
Guys, it's a joke!

780
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:48.945 line:82%
You guys can't take a joke.

781
01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.405 line:82%
Let's go!

782
01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.411 line:82%
Come here. Come.

783
01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.163 line:82%
Who can stop me?

784
01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:02.250 line:82%
Get back! Lie down!
I'll shoot you all!

785
01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.794 line:82%
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

786
01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:05.379 line:82%
You are gonna be
in a lot of trouble over this.

787
01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.132 line:82%
Really? Really? No...

788
01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:10.926 line:82%
You are in trouble too.

789
01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:14.805 line:82%
Stay out of my way!
I'll shoot.

790
01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:25.148 line:82%
You all right?
Come on.

791
01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:12.487 line:82%
Aryan! Aryan!

792
01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:15.782 line:82%
-Aryan!
-Okay.

793
01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:17.993 line:82%
-What?
-Come out.

794
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.494 line:82%
-What are you saying?
-Sir.

795
01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.083 line:82%
Arrest warrant for you.

796
01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:28.754 line:82%
What the hell is this?

797
01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:30.756 line:82%
I didn't go
to Madame Tussauds.

798
01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.466 line:82%
The Indian Ambassador
on line, sir.

799
01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:36.136 line:82%
I'm not talking to any ambassador.
I'm here to arrest him.

800
01:07:36.178 --> 01:07:38.680 line:82%
Sir, Mr. Khanna did not go
to Madame Tussauds--

801
01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:40.891 line:82%
Are you Mr. Khanna?

802
01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:42.934 line:82%
Then just shut up
and let me do my job.

803
01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:44.019 line:82%
Excuse me.

804
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.688 line:82%
So you are doing your job
and we are just faffing, right?

805
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:50.400 line:82%
Must say you have a very polite way
of talking to women, Mr. Duncan.

806
01:07:50.442 --> 01:07:53.987 line:82%
Guess what?
It's my turn to be polite now.

807
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:55.906 line:82%
This, sir, is bullshit.

808
01:07:57.908 --> 01:08:00.577 line:82%
Where were you between
10:00 and 10:30 this morning?

809
01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:03.371 line:82%
-I was at home.
-And who were you with?

810
01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:06.333 line:82%
-I was alone.
-Did anyone see you at home?

811
01:08:07.501 --> 01:08:08.919 line:82%
I just told you I was alone.

812
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.796 line:82%
Aryan, I'll call our lawyer.

813
01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:13.340 line:82%
Can you talk in a language
we all can understand?

814
01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:17.552 line:82%
Let me translate it
in a language you understand.

815
01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:20.018 line:82%
-Lawyer.
-Two options.

816
01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.351 line:82%
Handcuffs if you are nasty,
without handcuffs if you are nice.

817
01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:32.192 line:82%
Nasty.

818
01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:09.813 line:82%
I need just five minutes with him, sir.

819
01:09:09.855 --> 01:09:11.314 line:82%
-Just five minutes.
-You stay here.

820
01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:12.482 line:82%
Just five minutes sir, please.

821
01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:16.194 line:82%
Let's call Akhtar.
Come, come, come.

822
01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:39.175 line:82%
What happened?
Lost your funny bone?

823
01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:42.137 line:82%
That's not me.

824
01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:47.434 line:82%
Behaves like you,
looks like you.

825
01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.313 line:82%
Everybody calls this person
by your name.

826
01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.026 line:82%
I said that's not me.

827
01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:58.153 line:82%
You got any proof?

828
01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:03.575 line:82%
Come on, say something,
Mr. Superstar.

829
01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:08.371 line:82%
Not to you,
Mr. Small-time Cop.

830
01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:09.998 line:82%
Not a word without my lawyer.

831
01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:12.792 line:82%
Suit yourself.

832
01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:17.047 line:82%
Twenty-four hours remand for Mr. Khanna
until he comes out with the truth.

833
01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:20.592 line:82%
-You can't do that.
-Sure I can.

834
01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:30.810 line:82%
Sir, one photograph, please?

835
01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:31.853 line:82%
Yeah.

836
01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:39.653 line:82%
-You have a safe trip, sir.
-Yes, I will.

837
01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:49.723 line:82%
It's time. Let's go.

838
01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:13.830 line:82%
In Croatian, we say "how are you?"

839
01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:18.960 line:82%
I'm fine. My name is Gaurav.

840
01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:26.176 line:82%
Thank you.

841
01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:34.642 line:82%
-Vegetable sandwich... one.
-Yes?

842
01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:38.563 line:82%
-This one?
-Okay. Here we go.

843
01:12:42.067 --> 01:12:44.194 line:82%
-No, no, more. Six more.
-More?

844
01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:48.114 line:82%
Yeah, it's okay. Here.

845
01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.659 line:82%
Thank you.

846
01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:55.371 line:82%
Thank you.

847
01:13:25.777 --> 01:13:28.154 line:82%
It's only bail.

848
01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:29.906 line:82%
We know you're lying.

849
01:13:29.948 --> 01:13:32.659 line:82%
Why would I waste my lies on you?

850
01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.121 line:82%
That was no imposter,
you twisted psycho.

851
01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:37.914 line:82%
We'll have you back in jail in no time.

852
01:13:37.956 --> 01:13:39.541 line:82%
Yeah, please do that.

853
01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:42.168 line:82%
Maybe I'll earn some money suing you
and the entire British police.

854
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.630 line:82%
Aryan, please, control your temper.

855
01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:48.633 line:82%
It's their city, their country.

856
01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:52.137 line:82%
Don't make matters worse for yourself.

857
01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:55.265 line:82%
So we're done
with all the formalities? Yeah?

858
01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:58.726 line:82%
-Thanks a lot.
-Pathetic fool.

859
01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:03.815 line:82%
I'm coming with you to Dubrovnik
in case of any immigration issues.

860
01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:07.944 line:82%
Hey! Not that way.
The press is outside.

861
01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:13.199 line:82%
Aryan, this is the Deputy
High Commissioner, Mr. Murthy.

862
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.201 line:82%
-Thank you for meeting me.
-Pleased to meet you, sir.

863
01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:16.870 line:82%
And I'm really sorry you had
to go through all this,

864
01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:19.414 line:82%
but... we can't interfere
very much.

865
01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.166 line:82%
It is a foreign country after all.

866
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:24.043 line:82%
I know. Rules in every country
are made to get the innocent.

867
01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:27.130 line:82%
Sir, we're diplomats, not detectives.

868
01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:31.342 line:82%
Before the case is solved,
we have permission for you to travel.

869
01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:33.219 line:82%
Now we can only do that much.

870
01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:35.847 line:82%
It's a serious matter, a diplomatic issue.

871
01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:39.267 line:82%
So you must prove it wasn't you
at Madame Tussauds.

872
01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:42.604 line:82%
I must prove it?
Okay, I'll play cop.

873
01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:46.191 line:82%
I really appreciate your help.

874
01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:48.109 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

875
01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.652 line:82%
Thank you.
Thank you, sir, really.

876
01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:51.696 line:82%
Thank you.
You have a good day.

877
01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:56.034 line:82%
In jail or dancing at a wedding,
these stars are so arrogant.

878
01:14:57.535 --> 01:15:02.040 line:82%
Your home CCTV footage has saved us.
It's with the police.

879
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.626 line:82%
It proves an impostor
was at Madame Tussauds

880
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:06.044 line:82%
and you were at home.

881
01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:09.547 line:82%
Yeah, that's okay, but who is he?
What's his motive?

882
01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:11.049 line:82%
Forget the London cops. Find out.

883
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:12.842 line:82%
-We need to get this guy.
-Yeah.

884
01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:16.930 line:82%
We'll know more back in London.

885
01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:18.473 line:82%
So you know you can really relax now.

886
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.601 line:82%
-Wine? Champagne? Anything?
-Everything.

887
01:15:21.643 --> 01:15:23.519 line:82%
Come on, Aryan.
It's over now, okay?

888
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:25.480 line:82%
Sir, a call.

889
01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:29.275 line:82%
He says he knows the imposter
at Madame Tussauds.

890
01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:30.902 line:82%
Give me the phone.
I'll talk to him.

891
01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.278 line:82%
He'll only talk to Mr. Khanna.

892
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.864 line:82%
He won't give me his name.

893
01:15:34.906 --> 01:15:36.003 line:82%
Give it to me.

894
01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:42.872 line:82%
Hello?

895
01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.255 line:82%
Hello!

896
01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:51.464 line:82%
Senior?

897
01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:57.553 line:82%
Chandna?

898
01:15:58.825 --> 01:16:01.099 line:82%
I won't let you forget my name.

899
01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.101 line:82%
It'll be spoken in the same breath
as your name.

900
01:16:03.802 --> 01:16:04.852 line:82%
What do you want?

901
01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:06.646 line:82%
The stage is set.

902
01:16:06.688 --> 01:16:10.775 line:82%
Tell everyone, admit
what you did was wrong.

903
01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:13.695 line:82%
You'll never break a fan's heart again.
Say "I'm sorry."

904
01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:17.532 line:82%
Stop this nonsense!
I'm not apologizing to anyone.

905
01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.993 line:82%
I tried to make you see sense.

906
01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:22.662 line:82%
If you had agreed to give me
five minutes,

907
01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:25.456 line:82%
I would have my life
and you would have yours.

908
01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:28.167 line:82%
But you had to prove you had star power.

909
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.537 line:82%
-Now you'll see a fan's power.
-I'm a star.

910
01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:35.425 line:82%
I took your pranks as childishness,
had you thrown in jail a couple of days.

911
01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:38.177 line:82%
If l knew the real you,
you'd still be inside.

912
01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:41.377 line:82%
In 48 hours you did away
with my devotion of 25 years.

913
01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:46.769 line:82%
If you don't apologize,
your stardom will be over in 48 hours.

914
01:16:47.539 --> 01:16:51.566 line:82%
Do what you want.
I've seen off dozens like you.

915
01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.693 line:82%
The higher you fly,

916
01:16:54.275 --> 01:16:56.736 line:82%
the harder I'll make you fall.

917
01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.867 line:82%
But you must fly as high as me,
Gaurav Chandna.

918
01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:03.036 line:82%
For you, that's impossible.

919
01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.915 line:82%
We'll see how far you get
impersonating me.

920
01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:11.336 line:82%
I don't need to go far.

921
01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:14.130 line:82%
You're getting closer to me.
I'm in Dubrovnik.

922
01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:20.887 line:82%
That idiot!
He's in Dubrovnik.

923
01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:23.723 line:82%
No way...

924
01:17:23.765 --> 01:17:27.518 line:82%
Unknown caller,
unknown location.

925
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:31.189 line:82%
Obviously, Sunaina. He wouldn't
call from a traceable number.

926
01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:37.362 line:82%
Apologize to him.
It's no big deal.

927
01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:41.157 line:82%
He's mad.

928
01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.826 line:82%
Is that so? And what am I?

929
01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:49.791 line:82%
Is the make-up team in place?

930
01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.667 line:82%
They are on their way.
They'll be here in 20 minutes.

931
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:54.754 line:82%
Oh, great. And the props, fireworks,
confetti, all that?

932
01:17:54.796 --> 01:17:56.172 line:82%
We've done a couple of rehearsals.

933
01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:58.591 line:82%
-Everything's perfect.
-Okay. Thank you!

934
01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:02.011 line:82%
Aryan asked for a background check
of all the staff members.

935
01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:03.846 line:82%
-Is it done yet?
-It's going on right now.

936
01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:04.889 line:82%
Okay. Thank you.

937
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:10.812 line:82%
Nicksi Jelopera.

938
01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.368 line:82%
-Medium?
-Medium.

939
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:13.583 line:82%
You're so late, Aryan Khanna.
This is just not done.

940
01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:16.586 line:82%
I apologize.
I'm extremely sorry, Mr. Bhutiani.

941
01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:18.087 line:82%
I had a crisis, I'm sorry.

942
01:19:18.129 --> 01:19:21.632 line:82%
You celebrities always have some crisis,

943
01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:23.885 line:82%
but my daughter doesn't
get married every day.

944
01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.803 line:82%
-I know. I'm sorry.
-You've no idea.

945
01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:30.266 line:82%
That stunt you pulled in London
really embarrassed me.

946
01:19:30.308 --> 01:19:33.598 line:82%
No, no, no, Mr. Bhutiani.
What happened at Madame Tussauds--

947
01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.106 line:82%
You know what?
I'll make it up to you.

948
01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:38.608 line:82%
I swear. Your guests
will always think

949
01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:41.110 line:82%
of the grand Bhutiani wedding.
All right?

950
01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:44.405 line:82%
Well, they better do.
After all, I'm spending a ton on you.

951
01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:50.036 line:82%
Only you can. I'll get ready.

952
01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:54.373 line:82%
Sunaina, find out where
the CCTV cameras are.

953
01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:58.127 line:82%
Usman, watch the guest areas, the bars,
the toilets, the corridors.

954
01:19:58.169 --> 01:20:00.505 line:82%
-Keep an eye on everyone.
-Excuse me, sir.

955
01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:03.049 line:82%
I'm really sorry to interrupt,
but we just have two minutes.

956
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:05.843 line:82%
I don't need two, darling.
Let's go, I'm ready.

957
01:20:05.885 --> 01:20:08.304 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Good luck.

958
01:20:08.346 --> 01:20:09.805 line:82%
Payal, tell me the names.

959
01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:12.183 line:82%
Is Bhutiani's son-in-law
called Amul Mirchandani?

960
01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:13.601 line:82%
It's Anmol Mirchandani.

961
01:20:13.643 --> 01:20:15.645 line:82%
Guys, all the best.
Break a leg and do well.

962
01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:18.064 line:82%
And sisters Anushka, Deepshika?

963
01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:20.900 line:82%
-That's for later, it's all here.
-Yeah.

964
01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:23.819 line:82%
Second entry dance five, six,
seven, eight. You're giving it to me.

965
01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.446 line:82%
-Sir, your shades.
-Thank you, Payal.

966
01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:27.573 line:82%
Okay, guys.
You have 30 seconds to go.

967
01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:30.159 line:82%
All the best, just kill it, all right?

968
01:21:14.245 --> 01:21:15.997 line:82%
Check all entries and exits.

969
01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.582 line:82%
Okay, Sunaina.

970
01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:31.929 line:82%
-Find anything?
-Not yet, sir.

971
01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:35.349 line:82%
I've spoken to the team,
no one enters without an invite.

972
01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:36.851 line:82%
Sir, your cue cards.

973
01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.185 line:82%
And, sir, you have 15 seconds.

974
01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.562 line:82%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

975
01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:40.605 line:82%
Can you go to cam 4?

976
01:21:45.026 --> 01:21:47.486 line:82%
When you count the night stars

977
01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:50.114 line:82%
and yearn to etch her name
on every star...

978
01:21:50.156 --> 01:21:51.866 line:82%
you know you're in love.

979
01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:54.452 line:82%
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead,

980
01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:56.871 line:82%
when you look for her
in a crowd,

981
01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.331 line:82%
you know you're in love.

982
01:22:01.459 --> 01:22:02.877 line:82%
"Say sorry."

983
01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:07.298 line:82%
Check the crew's photos.

984
01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:10.051 line:82%
He's not a guest.
He's a crew member. Quick!

985
01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.093 line:82%
-Check it.
-Got it.

986
01:22:14.989 --> 01:22:16.390 line:82%
Oh... sorry.

987
01:22:29.362 --> 01:22:30.363 line:82%
There. Zoom in.

988
01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:33.824 line:82%
Check the crew backstage.
There are many crew members.

989
01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:34.909 line:82%
Copy!

990
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.913 line:82%
Payal, we need the crew IDs.
Photographs and bio-datas.

991
01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:41.165 line:82%
-Anything serious, sir?
-No, Aryan wants to know.

992
01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:42.541 line:82%
Just general protocol.

993
01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.639 line:82%
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

994
01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:01.977 line:82%
The crew is local.

995
01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:04.939 line:82%
Except one guy. Half Indian,
half Croatian

996
01:23:07.358 --> 01:23:10.027 line:82%
Akhtar is sending you a photo of him.

997
01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:11.195 line:82%
Keep your eyes peeled.

998
01:23:16.701 --> 01:23:18.077 line:82%
Round up all the crew.

999
01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:50.109 line:82%
-Any sign of him?
-Nothing, sir.

1000
01:23:50.151 --> 01:23:51.777 line:82%
He's not responding.

1001
01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:54.739 line:82%
-Sunaina.
-Can't see him on any camera.

1002
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.365 line:82%
-But I'm at it.
-What are you at it?

1003
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.790 line:82%
Where is there no CCTV camera?

1004
01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:07.001 line:82%
Only your make-up room.

1005
01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:17.344 line:82%
Careful, sir.

1006
01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:38.240 line:82%
I AM YOU

1007
01:24:49.168 --> 01:24:51.754 line:82%
You're very stubborn.
You don't listen to me.

1008
01:24:51.796 --> 01:24:55.341 line:82%
Why are you hiding?
Talk face to face.

1009
01:24:56.042 --> 01:24:58.179 line:82%
I stand face to face, Aryan Khanna.

1010
01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:01.153 line:82%
But you never see me.

1011
01:25:01.806 --> 01:25:05.476 line:82%
Now when I'm not there,
you're longing to see me.

1012
01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:09.146 line:82%
I know the feeling.

1013
01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:11.341 line:82%
I felt it in the crowd
in front of your house.

1014
01:25:17.822 --> 01:25:22.201 line:82%
Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting.
The audience interaction--

1015
01:25:22.243 --> 01:25:25.120 line:82%
Yeah, yeah.
I... I'll get ready.

1016
01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:26.622 line:82%
-Yes, sir.
-I'll take care of it.

1017
01:25:26.664 --> 01:25:27.873 line:82%
Thank you.

1018
01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:32.670 line:82%
I'll come back and see you.
Hi, sweetheart.

1019
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:34.338 line:82%
Hope you enjoyed the show.

1020
01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:35.965 line:82%
-Aryan, it was marvelous.
-Thank you.

1021
01:25:36.006 --> 01:25:38.008 line:82%
Aryan, that's my daughter.

1022
01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:41.762 line:82%
She's been practicing a step
to dance with you for two months.

1023
01:25:41.804 --> 01:25:43.764 line:82%
Actually we were both practicing.

1024
01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:45.307 line:82%
How pretty is she!

1025
01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:47.434 line:82%
You know what?
Let me start with the young one.

1026
01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.270 line:82%
And I'll come back for the experience.

1027
01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.004 line:82%
Sir, we've found Chandna.

1028
01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:17.423 line:82%
He's across from where
you're dancing,

1029
01:26:17.464 --> 01:26:19.550 line:82%
-in the corridor.
-I'm not dancing.

1030
01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:22.344 line:82%
Chandna is on the dance floor.

1031
01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:14.021 line:82%
What the hell is wrong with him?

1032
01:27:14.063 --> 01:27:15.522 line:82%
I was just dancing.

1033
01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:17.566 line:82%
He started touching me here,
there, everywhere.

1034
01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:18.609 line:82%
What happened?

1035
01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:20.402 line:82%
I don't know.
You'll have to do something.

1036
01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:23.197 line:82%
-Just get him out.
-I don't care.

1037
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:25.457 line:82%
Where is he?

1038
01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:35.125 line:82%
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

1039
01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:37.211 line:82%
-Mr. Bhutiani?
-Where do you think you are?

1040
01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:38.712 line:82%
Calm down, Mr. Bhutiani.
What happened?

1041
01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:40.714 line:82%
That girl is like my daughter, damn it!

1042
01:27:42.508 --> 01:27:44.468 line:82%
Is this how you film stars behave?

1043
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:46.971 line:82%
I'm really sorry, ladies!
I'm sorry!

1044
01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:50.099 line:82%
I'll explain. The guy who was
here wasn't me--

1045
01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.350 line:82%
-Bullshit!
-I'm telling you,

1046
01:27:51.392 --> 01:27:52.601 line:82%
it was somebody else.
I'm Aryan Khanna.

1047
01:27:52.643 --> 01:27:53.978 line:82%
Do you expect me
to believe this?

1048
01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:55.896 line:82%
-Yes! I'm Aryan Khanna.
-What bullshit!

1049
01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:57.606 line:82%
You have known me for years,
Mr. Bhutiani!

1050
01:27:57.648 --> 01:28:00.567 line:82%
I love you guys.
I'd never harm you people.

1051
01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:02.736 line:82%
-That person wasn't me.
-Aryan...

1052
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:05.864 line:82%
I suggest you leave.

1053
01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:20.879 line:82%
Stay back!

1054
01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:24.091 line:82%
Hold on! Make some room!
Please step back!

1055
01:28:24.133 --> 01:28:26.135 line:82%
Please, sir! Please!

1056
01:28:31.926 --> 01:28:33.079 line:82%
Stop the car!

1057
01:33:54.296 --> 01:33:56.539 line:82%
No one has given me
the interaction script.

1058
01:33:57.758 --> 01:34:00.927 line:82%
Fifteen minutes to showtime.
Is there a delay or something?

1059
01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:06.475 line:82%
What?

1060
01:34:13.190 --> 01:34:14.937 line:82%
The show's canceled.

1061
01:34:15.859 --> 01:34:20.218 line:82%
The fans boycotted the show
after the Buthiani wedding incident.

1062
01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:24.076 line:82%
Sponsors have also pulled out.

1063
01:34:26.328 --> 01:34:29.498 line:82%
Nobody came, not a soul.

1064
01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:31.852 line:82%
The person that you're trying to reach
is not accepting any calls right now.

1065
01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:33.437 line:82%
Please try again later.

1066
01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.279 line:82%
-What's the matter with you?
-You wimp.

1067
01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.613 line:82%
Watch where you're going!

1068
01:35:56.585 --> 01:35:58.962 line:82%
Media is playing up the story.

1069
01:35:59.004 --> 01:36:01.631 line:82%
The wedding video has gone viral.

1070
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:21.234 line:82%
Given Khanna's status, he must take
responsibility for his actions.

1071
01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:22.861 line:82%
You know, I think
it's the attention problem.

1072
01:36:22.903 --> 01:36:25.489 line:82%
These movie stars forget that
one day they'll be has-beens.

1073
01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:27.365 line:82%
I think they go through
some kind of trauma.

1074
01:36:27.407 --> 01:36:28.533 line:82%
Look at what he's done.

1075
01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:30.827 line:82%
If an ordinary man misbehaves,
it's a crime.

1076
01:36:30.869 --> 01:36:33.830 line:82%
If it's a star, it's a stunt.
Why these double standards for stars?

1077
01:36:33.872 --> 01:36:36.416 line:82%
A criminal is a criminal.

1078
01:36:45.717 --> 01:36:46.718 line:82%
Hello?

1079
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.763 line:82%
Hello, sir. It's me, Aryan,
I'm calling from London.

1080
01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:52.974 line:82%
I know you are in London,
but what's going on?

1081
01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:57.771 line:82%
A Delhi boy is impersonating me,
committing crimes.

1082
01:36:57.812 --> 01:36:59.481 line:82%
We have to arrest him.

1083
01:36:59.523 --> 01:37:03.193 line:82%
But the crimes are committed
outside of India.

1084
01:37:03.235 --> 01:37:06.530 line:82%
We can't arrest him.
It's not in our jurisdiction.

1085
01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:08.907 line:82%
Must we wait till he commits
a crime in India?

1086
01:37:09.908 --> 01:37:11.409 line:82%
His name is Gaurav Chandna.

1087
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:14.162 line:82%
Find me his Delhi address.
It will help.

1088
01:37:14.934 --> 01:37:17.290 line:82%
You don't tell me how to do
my job, okay?

1089
01:37:17.332 --> 01:37:19.793 line:82%
But who should we arrest?
You're the accused, Aryan.

1090
01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:23.046 line:82%
No, I'm not! I just...

1091
01:37:23.088 --> 01:37:25.882 line:82%
Come back to India.

1092
01:37:25.924 --> 01:37:29.010 line:82%
Then we'll look into the matter
with the proper procedure. Okay?

1093
01:37:30.345 --> 01:37:32.764 line:82%
-I've been trying to call him all day.
-Hello?

1094
01:37:35.725 --> 01:37:37.185 line:82%
What did he say?

1095
01:37:39.854 --> 01:37:42.274 line:82%
Organize a press conference
first thing tomorrow morning.

1096
01:37:42.315 --> 01:37:44.859 line:82%
-In Mumbai?
-No, here in London.

1097
01:37:45.986 --> 01:37:48.405 line:82%
Well, look at this!
This is gonna get interesting!

1098
01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:53.994 line:82%
You now have the video footage,
and all the documents, copies, etc.

1099
01:37:54.675 --> 01:37:56.955 line:82%
You have proof

1100
01:37:56.997 --> 01:38:00.875 line:82%
that Aryan Khanna did not
commit these crimes.

1101
01:38:00.917 --> 01:38:02.544 line:82%
Question! Question!

1102
01:38:10.343 --> 01:38:13.847 line:82%
You're angry with me,
and you have every right to be.

1103
01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:16.850 line:82%
But believe me.

1104
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:20.312 line:82%
That dangerous and evil face
you see on TV is not me.

1105
01:38:20.353 --> 01:38:21.938 line:82%
That person is not me.

1106
01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:23.231 line:82%
So please give me time.

1107
01:38:23.273 --> 01:38:27.027 line:82%
Time, so that I can prove
I've done nothing wrong.

1108
01:38:28.695 --> 01:38:32.032 line:82%
I'd never do anything that
would make you ashamed

1109
01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:34.242 line:82%
to call me your star.

1110
01:38:34.284 --> 01:38:35.865 line:82%
Whatever I am...

1111
01:38:39.998 --> 01:38:44.628 line:82%
I just want to say,
I would never do anything like this.

1112
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:47.756 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Sir! Sir! Sir!

1113
01:38:47.797 --> 01:38:51.885 line:82%
Sir, do you know this impostor?
Have you met him?

1114
01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:54.262 line:82%
I'm so sorry.
We can't talk now.

1115
01:38:54.304 --> 01:38:56.222 line:82%
The case is in court,
the matter's sealed.

1116
01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:58.016 line:82%
What about the imposter's name?

1117
01:38:58.058 --> 01:39:00.935 line:82%
As soon as we have proof,
you'll be the first to know.

1118
01:39:00.977 --> 01:39:04.189 line:82%
Are you the real Aryan Khanna
or the imposter?

1119
01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:11.738 line:82%
You find this funny?
It's a big joke?

1120
01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:15.700 line:82%
If this happened to a girl in your family,
would you still be grinning?

1121
01:39:17.494 --> 01:39:21.206 line:82%
A woman was molested
and you find it funny?

1122
01:39:22.374 --> 01:39:23.792 line:82%
And one more thing.

1123
01:39:24.626 --> 01:39:27.253 line:82%
This press conference is not
to prove my innocence.

1124
01:39:28.254 --> 01:39:31.174 line:82%
I want to warn you all.

1125
01:39:31.216 --> 01:39:34.719 line:82%
The man who's impersonating me,
tarnishing my name.

1126
01:39:34.761 --> 01:39:37.806 line:82%
He can hurt anyone, any time.

1127
01:39:37.847 --> 01:39:39.307 line:82%
So please be careful.

1128
01:39:41.393 --> 01:39:43.061 line:82%
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you for coming.

1129
01:39:43.103 --> 01:39:45.689 line:82%
Aryan has a flight to catch,
he's going back to India.

1130
01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:47.315 line:82%
So have a great day
and see you soon.

1131
01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:04.290 line:82%
Don't stop, go in the back. Right.

1132
01:40:14.884 --> 01:40:16.010 line:82%
Open up!

1133
01:40:17.929 --> 01:40:20.682 line:82%
One minute, sir.
Your wife said we must inform her.

1134
01:40:20.724 --> 01:40:24.602 line:82%
Good. Hurry up,
before the reporters outside mob me.

1135
01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:33.570 line:82%
-Hello?
-Ma'am, can the boss come in?

1136
01:40:36.156 --> 01:40:37.532 line:82%
No, wait a second.

1137
01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:42.370 line:82%
-Are you sure it's him?
-It sounds like him.

1138
01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:44.789 line:82%
Ask him to face the camera.

1139
01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.127 line:82%
Sir, your wife wants you
to step forward.

1140
01:40:54.174 --> 01:40:55.592 line:82%
Hi, I am Aryan Khanna.

1141
01:40:55.633 --> 01:40:59.679 line:82%
Height 5'10". Hair black,
eyes black and a big nose.

1142
01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:01.598 line:82%
School: Kendriya Vidyalaya,
Sarojini Nagar, New Delhi.

1143
01:41:01.639 --> 01:41:04.476 line:82%
College: Hans Raj College,
Delhi University.

1144
01:41:06.144 --> 01:41:07.812 line:82%
Give me the phone, quick!

1145
01:41:09.731 --> 01:41:12.692 line:82%
The press will surround me.

1146
01:41:12.734 --> 01:41:15.445 line:82%
Let me in, or I'll end up in their arms.

1147
01:41:15.487 --> 01:41:16.738 line:82%
Why is your phone off?

1148
01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:19.532 line:82%
Can I tell you inside, please?

1149
01:41:22.744 --> 01:41:24.496 line:82%
Open the door.

1150
01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.424 line:82%
Guys! Dad's here!

1151
01:41:59.877 --> 01:42:01.037 line:82%
Aryan!

1152
01:42:02.576 --> 01:42:04.118 line:82%
Aryan! You're back?

1153
01:42:05.912 --> 01:42:07.413 line:82%
Give me a hug!

1154
01:42:16.714 --> 01:42:18.508 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

1155
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:21.469 line:82%
-You're back.
-Yeah, I'm back.

1156
01:42:23.805 --> 01:42:24.961 line:82%
Are the kids asleep?

1157
01:42:30.186 --> 01:42:33.064 line:82%
Yes. It's way past their bedtime.

1158
01:42:33.106 --> 01:42:35.191 line:82%
Of course!
Of course.

1159
01:42:35.233 --> 01:42:37.360 line:82%
Let them sleep.

1160
01:42:38.361 --> 01:42:42.365 line:82%
Let's relax and talk quietly
in our room.

1161
01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:47.829 line:82%
Yeah!

1162
01:42:53.668 --> 01:42:58.256 line:82%
-What an entrance exam!
-You passed with flying colors.

1163
01:42:58.298 --> 01:43:01.134 line:82%
Of course, I spent my life
preparing for this moment.

1164
01:43:01.175 --> 01:43:03.970 line:82%
Relax and make yourself a drink.
I'll run the shower for you.

1165
01:43:04.012 --> 01:43:05.221 line:82%
Of course, of course.

1166
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:21.738 line:82%
She was crying.

1167
01:43:21.779 --> 01:43:24.490 line:82%
It wasn't easy getting her
to sleep again.

1168
01:43:28.912 --> 01:43:32.874 line:82%
It's better for us both if Isha
stays asleep.

1169
01:43:39.088 --> 01:43:40.352 line:82%
I did say...

1170
01:43:41.591 --> 01:43:43.927 line:82%
we could talk calmly.

1171
01:43:45.678 --> 01:43:46.846 line:82%
Why do you need that?

1172
01:43:47.847 --> 01:43:49.098 line:82%
Give it to me.

1173
01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:52.977 line:82%
I have nothing against you
or your children.

1174
01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:55.772 line:82%
Give me that!

1175
01:43:58.650 --> 01:44:00.360 line:82%
Senior ignores me.

1176
01:44:01.903 --> 01:44:03.488 line:82%
You can't let him do that.

1177
01:44:05.782 --> 01:44:09.494 line:82%
Show me Aryan's study.
He's always talking about it.

1178
01:44:13.331 --> 01:44:16.751 line:82%
Sound asleep.
Come, come.

1179
01:44:25.255 --> 01:44:28.680 line:82%
Sit down. He lands in 20 minutes,
I don't have much time.

1180
01:44:28.721 --> 01:44:31.474 line:82%
Come on, sit down.

1181
01:44:35.311 --> 01:44:37.313 line:82%
This room has so many stories.

1182
01:44:39.857 --> 01:44:41.945 line:82%
There are many stories
behind these awards.

1183
01:44:43.236 --> 01:44:44.904 line:82%
And these costumes...

1184
01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.825 line:82%
Days that Aryan
does not want to forget.

1185
01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:53.329 line:82%
These are memories he wants
to keep close to his heart.

1186
01:44:59.507 --> 01:45:01.963 line:82%
I treasured his memories too.

1187
01:45:02.877 --> 01:45:06.092 line:82%
Kept them right here...
and here.

1188
01:45:08.636 --> 01:45:13.433 line:82%
At home, on the walls
of my room, in cabinets.

1189
01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:16.019 line:82%
On shelves like these.

1190
01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:27.280 line:82%
Aryan Khanna filled every corner
of my life.

1191
01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:29.490 line:82%
Really.

1192
01:45:29.532 --> 01:45:31.451 line:82%
But he ended it all.

1193
01:45:31.492 --> 01:45:35.455 line:82%
Five minutes! I asked him
for just five minutes.

1194
01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:36.956 line:82%
You know what he said?

1195
01:45:36.998 --> 01:45:40.126 line:82%
"It's my life. Why must I give you
even five seconds of it?"

1196
01:45:45.423 --> 01:45:48.641 line:82%
-I apologize on his behalf.
-Why should you apologize? Why?

1197
01:45:49.761 --> 01:45:51.537 line:82%
I hit Sid Kapoor for him!

1198
01:45:52.764 --> 01:45:54.339 line:82%
He was hassling Aryan!

1199
01:45:55.183 --> 01:45:56.392 line:82%
And what did Aryan do?

1200
01:45:56.434 --> 01:45:58.126 line:82%
He threw me in jail,
had me beaten.

1201
01:45:59.228 --> 01:46:03.858 line:82%
Said: "It's a crime!"

1202
01:46:05.693 --> 01:46:09.363 line:82%
Crime is what I'll do now.

1203
01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:13.868 line:82%
Breaking hearts of fans who are
devoted to you...

1204
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:15.620 line:82%
is a crime too.

1205
01:46:19.373 --> 01:46:21.834 line:82%
You tell me.

1206
01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:23.540 line:82%
Am I so wrong?

1207
01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:28.382 line:82%
When he fights with you,
doesn't he say sorry?

1208
01:46:30.954 --> 01:46:33.888 line:82%
So why can't he say sorry
to me? Tell me!

1209
01:46:33.930 --> 01:46:36.599 line:82%
Please don't do this.
I beg of you.

1210
01:46:36.641 --> 01:46:38.329 line:82%
What do you mean, "please"?

1211
01:46:39.393 --> 01:46:42.355 line:82%
He left me with nothing.
Why must I leave anything for him?

1212
01:46:42.396 --> 01:46:44.564 line:82%
How can l?
It's impossible!

1213
01:46:45.566 --> 01:46:48.319 line:82%
A sham! All lies!

1214
01:46:48.361 --> 01:46:51.175 line:82%
He's a liar! A fake!

1215
01:46:52.532 --> 01:46:54.271 line:82%
The jerk is constantly acting.

1216
01:46:55.493 --> 01:46:56.728 line:82%
He's an actor, after all.

1217
01:47:05.563 --> 01:47:07.633 line:82%
I wanted to give him my trophy.

1218
01:47:12.885 --> 01:47:15.805 line:82%
A belated happy birthday,
Aryan Khanna.

1219
01:47:37.034 --> 01:47:38.870 line:82%
Open the door!

1220
01:47:55.928 --> 01:47:58.347 line:82%
The children are with my parents.

1221
01:47:59.390 --> 01:48:03.352 line:82%
They were terrified.
I didn't know what to tell them.

1222
01:48:03.394 --> 01:48:04.645 line:82%
Isha asked me repeatedly:

1223
01:48:04.687 --> 01:48:07.023 line:82%
"Why did Papa destroy the study?"

1224
01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:11.068 line:82%
-Don't worry, it's okay.
-Why don't we call the police?

1225
01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:13.988 line:82%
The police will do nothing.

1226
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:16.536 line:82%
They'll ask for proof.
They believe I'm the criminal.

1227
01:48:17.783 --> 01:48:20.244 line:82%
I came this far in life
on my own steam.

1228
01:48:21.621 --> 01:48:23.664 line:82%
I'll handle it myself.

1229
01:48:26.918 --> 01:48:28.791 line:82%
I'll play rough, like a thug.

1230
01:48:29.879 --> 01:48:32.632 line:82%
I'll rip him apart, send him back
to where he belongs.

1231
01:48:34.342 --> 01:48:36.761 line:82%
Gaurav Chandna
has seen my star face.

1232
01:48:38.304 --> 01:48:40.598 line:82%
Now he'll see my real face.

1233
01:48:41.891 --> 01:48:43.295 line:82%
I'm a Delhi man too.

1234
01:48:45.228 --> 01:48:49.190 line:82%
The dangerous and evil face
on the news is not me.

1235
01:48:49.232 --> 01:48:51.275 line:82%
That person is not me.
Give me time.

1236
01:48:51.317 --> 01:48:53.444 line:82%
I'll prove I've done nothing wrong.

1237
01:48:53.486 --> 01:48:57.198 line:82%
I'd never do anything to make you ashamed
of calling me your star.

1238
01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:01.118 line:82%
Aryan Khanna's press conference
proves that he is innocent.

1239
01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:05.039 line:82%
A criminal is impersonating him
and committing crimes.

1240
01:49:05.081 --> 01:49:08.793 line:82%
Who is doing it?
What's his name? Where is he?

1241
01:49:08.834 --> 01:49:13.965 line:82%
No one knows the motives
behind his terrible actions.

1242
01:49:14.006 --> 01:49:19.095 line:82%
The police have informed us
that they're very hopeful

1243
01:49:19.136 --> 01:49:22.265 line:82%
this criminal will not escape.

1244
01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:24.934 line:82%
Once he's arrested,
his punishment will be severe.

1245
01:49:49.125 --> 01:49:52.086 line:82%
-Hello, Gauru?
-Mommy?

1246
01:49:52.711 --> 01:49:54.005 line:82%
What's wrong with your phone?

1247
01:49:54.046 --> 01:49:56.674 line:82%
-Where are you, Gauru?
-Right here.

1248
01:49:57.476 --> 01:50:01.012 line:82%
I'm okay. And you?

1249
01:50:01.053 --> 01:50:03.889 line:82%
Son, come home soon.
We're in trouble.

1250
01:50:07.268 --> 01:50:11.063 line:82%
You've roamed the world.
Now return to your home.

1251
01:50:14.942 --> 01:50:15.943 line:82%
Aryan?

1252
01:50:17.903 --> 01:50:19.155 line:82%
You barged into my home?

1253
01:50:19.196 --> 01:50:23.117 line:82%
You can barge into mine.
Why can't I do the same?

1254
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:27.872 line:82%
I came here to throttle
your parents

1255
01:50:27.913 --> 01:50:30.020 line:82%
and ask them why they produced
a nasty son like you.

1256
01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:32.293 line:82%
But I am not a lowlife like you.

1257
01:50:32.335 --> 01:50:34.628 line:82%
Don't drag my parents into this.

1258
01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:36.589 line:82%
They did nothing.

1259
01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:38.257 line:82%
What did my kids do?

1260
01:50:38.299 --> 01:50:42.261 line:82%
I entered your fortress alone.
Did you bring an army?

1261
01:50:42.303 --> 01:50:44.638 line:82%
I am here alone,
Gaurav Chandna.

1262
01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.684 line:82%
No security, no secretary.
No star, no hero.

1263
01:50:48.726 --> 01:50:51.228 line:82%
If you have the guts, face me.

1264
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:52.730 line:82%
Settle the score.

1265
01:50:54.315 --> 01:50:57.026 line:82%
The score will only be settled
when you apologize.

1266
01:50:58.027 --> 01:51:01.364 line:82%
Go on the Inder Vihar contest
stage and apologize.

1267
01:51:01.405 --> 01:51:02.907 line:82%
And listen...

1268
01:51:02.948 --> 01:51:06.369 line:82%
If you touch my parents,
even with a feather,

1269
01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:07.953 line:82%
I know where
your mother-in-law lives

1270
01:51:08.945 --> 01:51:10.414 line:82%
and where your children are hiding.

1271
01:51:11.415 --> 01:51:13.250 line:82%
I swear, your daughter is so cute.

1272
01:51:16.962 --> 01:51:18.547 line:82%
Your son is stubborn like you.

1273
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:20.383 line:82%
Stop this bullshit!

1274
01:51:20.424 --> 01:51:24.011 line:82%
I'll bury you alive if you dream
of harming my kids.

1275
01:51:27.556 --> 01:51:29.683 line:82%
What would my parents think?

1276
01:51:31.435 --> 01:51:32.672 line:82%
Such a big star...

1277
01:51:34.814 --> 01:51:36.148 line:82%
using such foul language.

1278
01:51:39.235 --> 01:51:40.387 line:82%
Forget it.

1279
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:44.407 line:82%
See you at the contest.

1280
01:51:46.617 --> 01:51:48.494 line:82%
Your son has lost his mind.

1281
01:51:49.537 --> 01:51:53.082 line:82%
-He's crossed the line.
-Our Gaurav was not like that.

1282
01:51:53.124 --> 01:51:55.588 line:82%
He was a good boy.

1283
01:51:56.752 --> 01:51:59.171 line:82%
He changed after meeting you.

1284
01:51:59.213 --> 01:52:02.425 line:82%
What would you have lost
if you'd given him five minutes?

1285
01:52:02.466 --> 01:52:05.803 line:82%
Don't blame Aryan.
It's our fault.

1286
01:52:07.555 --> 01:52:11.809 line:82%
We let him get obsessed
with your glamorous life,

1287
01:52:11.851 --> 01:52:13.102 line:82%
not your hard work.

1288
01:52:13.144 --> 01:52:18.691 line:82%
He should've followed your example,
worked hard and become someone.

1289
01:52:20.067 --> 01:52:23.737 line:82%
Then the call center girl
could've become his girlfriend or wife.

1290
01:52:26.991 --> 01:52:29.076 line:82%
He has a girlfriend?

1291
01:52:29.118 --> 01:52:32.580 line:82%
It's unrequited.
Gaurav loves her, but...

1292
01:52:32.621 --> 01:52:36.542 line:82%
Enough. We have to accept things
the way they are.

1293
01:52:36.584 --> 01:52:38.627 line:82%
Where's the contest held?

1294
01:52:39.399 --> 01:52:41.881 line:82%
At the other end of the colony.

1295
01:52:41.922 --> 01:52:45.176 line:82%
Apologize. Put an end
to this terrible situation.

1296
01:52:45.217 --> 01:52:47.011 line:82%
You think I'm wrong, too?

1297
01:52:47.052 --> 01:52:48.804 line:82%
And I must apologize?

1298
01:52:48.846 --> 01:52:50.444 line:82%
Have him arrested.

1299
01:52:52.349 --> 01:52:54.685 line:82%
He must be punished.

1300
01:52:56.145 --> 01:53:00.191 line:82%
Send him to prison for years,
if you must.

1301
01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:05.412 line:82%
But don't beat him up.

1302
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:07.948 line:82%
Please.

1303
01:54:13.264 --> 01:54:16.725 line:82%
Hey, Junior.
Where were you?

1304
01:54:16.767 --> 01:54:19.228 line:82%
-Hello, uncle, hello, auntie.
-Hello.

1305
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:21.772 line:82%
Have you been watching
the news about Aryan on TV?

1306
01:54:22.856 --> 01:54:26.944 line:82%
Never mind.
I have good news.

1307
01:54:26.986 --> 01:54:28.571 line:82%
I've got my American visa!

1308
01:54:28.612 --> 01:54:31.198 line:82%
-I knew it.
-Thank you.

1309
01:54:32.866 --> 01:54:36.537 line:82%
Why is he standing with his back
to me? It's not like him.

1310
01:54:36.579 --> 01:54:40.666 line:82%
He's going on stage soon,
he's just nervous.

1311
01:54:40.708 --> 01:54:42.334 line:82%
Him? And nervous?

1312
01:54:42.376 --> 01:54:45.671 line:82%
Has he done anything in life
besides copying Aryan?

1313
01:54:45.713 --> 01:54:48.966 line:82%
Hey, Mr. Superstar,
your make-up...

1314
01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.602 line:82%
Neha.

1315
01:55:02.688 --> 01:55:04.481 line:82%
I have to talk to you.

1316
01:55:06.942 --> 01:55:09.778 line:82%
A super surprise!

1317
01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:13.365 line:82%
At the Western Union
"moving money for better"

1318
01:55:13.407 --> 01:55:17.369 line:82%
Super Star competition,
I give you our final act.

1319
01:55:17.411 --> 01:55:19.580 line:82%
Our favorite winner.

1320
01:55:19.622 --> 01:55:23.292 line:82%
Our Aryan Khanna, Jr.!

1321
01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:29.632 line:82%
He's a criminal!
We don't want to see him!

1322
01:55:29.673 --> 01:55:32.217 line:82%
Get him off the stage!

1323
01:55:41.268 --> 01:55:42.603 line:82%
Calm down.

1324
01:55:42.645 --> 01:55:44.688 line:82%
It's not the real Aryan Khanna.

1325
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:48.567 line:82%
It's our very own superstar...
Gaurav Chandna.

1326
01:55:48.609 --> 01:55:50.527 line:82%
Give him a big hand!

1327
01:56:24.853 --> 01:56:29.400 line:82%
I do a show
for Aryan every year.

1328
01:56:29.441 --> 01:56:32.861 line:82%
I know, ma'am.
You cheer the loudest.

1329
01:56:32.903 --> 01:56:34.947 line:82%
But this year's show...

1330
01:56:34.988 --> 01:56:37.005 line:82%
The show today is for...

1331
01:56:38.659 --> 01:56:40.577 line:82%
someone else.

1332
01:56:40.619 --> 01:56:44.206 line:82%
The girl over there, who is...

1333
01:56:44.248 --> 01:56:47.084 line:82%
smiling at me.
She's my friend.

1334
01:56:47.126 --> 01:56:51.255 line:82%
Neha!
Come on, babes.

1335
01:56:56.719 --> 01:57:00.339 line:82%
There's something I've kept
in my heart for days.

1336
01:57:04.268 --> 01:57:05.769 line:82%
I love you, Neha.

1337
01:57:07.271 --> 01:57:09.773 line:82%
-I love you too, Aryan.
-Not Aryan!

1338
01:57:09.815 --> 01:57:12.609 line:82%
Gaurav loves you!

1339
01:57:14.778 --> 01:57:17.781 line:82%
Gaurav loves Neha.

1340
01:57:17.823 --> 01:57:20.367 line:82%
-Stop it, Gaurav!
-What nonsense!

1341
01:57:20.409 --> 01:57:21.535 line:82%
Get lost.

1342
01:57:21.577 --> 01:57:24.121 line:82%
-He's nuts.
-Thinks he's real Aryan Khanna.

1343
01:57:24.163 --> 01:57:25.205 line:82%
Get him off.

1344
01:57:25.247 --> 01:57:28.417 line:82%
Wait! He is talking to me.
I'll deal with it.

1345
01:57:28.459 --> 01:57:30.794 line:82%
Say it again.

1346
01:57:30.836 --> 01:57:33.297 line:82%
I love you!

1347
01:57:33.338 --> 01:57:36.341 line:82%
Drop it.
You love only Aryan.

1348
01:57:36.383 --> 01:57:38.302 line:82%
He can go to hell.

1349
01:57:38.343 --> 01:57:41.680 line:82%
-Is that you talking?
-It's not just talk.

1350
01:57:41.722 --> 01:57:43.807 line:82%
I've sent him to hell.

1351
01:57:43.849 --> 01:57:46.310 line:82%
I fixed Aryan Khanna for good.

1352
01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:49.438 line:82%
First in London,
then in Dubrovnik.

1353
01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:53.150 line:82%
I made my way
into his house, too.

1354
01:57:53.192 --> 01:57:58.197 line:82%
Once there, I smashed
everything in sight.

1355
01:57:58.238 --> 01:58:02.409 line:82%
If you don't believe me, read the papers,
or the Internet, or watch TV.

1356
01:58:02.451 --> 01:58:05.204 line:82%
Your Gaurav is famous all over the world.

1357
01:58:06.371 --> 01:58:09.708 line:82%
I'm no less than Aryan.
Not at all.

1358
01:58:10.834 --> 01:58:13.337 line:82%
I am a star in real life.

1359
01:58:13.378 --> 01:58:16.131 line:82%
Not a star. A monster.

1360
01:58:16.173 --> 01:58:17.633 line:82%
What?

1361
01:58:17.674 --> 01:58:20.010 line:82%
They all think you're a star,

1362
01:58:20.052 --> 01:58:22.346 line:82%
and you shamed Inder Vihar.

1363
01:58:22.387 --> 01:58:26.642 line:82%
Listen to her.
I became a monster for her.

1364
01:58:26.683 --> 01:58:28.477 line:82%
I don't want to know a monster.

1365
01:58:28.519 --> 01:58:30.771 line:82%
A monster! Forget it.

1366
01:58:30.813 --> 01:58:33.357 line:82%
Take my hand and say:
"I love you too."

1367
01:58:33.398 --> 01:58:34.650 line:82%
-Let go.
-I won't.

1368
01:58:34.691 --> 01:58:35.692 line:82%
But I'm telling you--

1369
01:58:57.381 --> 01:58:58.799 line:82%
I'm very, very sorry, Neha.

1370
01:58:58.841 --> 01:59:01.093 line:82%
Are you okay?
Thanks for your help!

1371
01:59:01.134 --> 01:59:03.804 line:82%
Aryan!
He's a good guy.

1372
01:59:08.767 --> 01:59:10.143 line:82%
Gaurav!

1373
01:59:18.318 --> 01:59:19.486 line:82%
Get down!

1374
02:03:50.882 --> 02:03:52.175 line:82%
Enough!

1375
02:03:54.261 --> 02:03:55.846 line:82%
Enough of this game.

1376
02:03:56.847 --> 02:03:57.848 line:82%
Come on, get up!

1377
02:04:03.173 --> 02:04:04.497 line:82%
I am happy with my life.

1378
02:04:05.856 --> 02:04:07.482 line:82%
Can't you be happy with yours?

1379
02:04:10.569 --> 02:04:12.539 line:82%
Be a good son to your parents.

1380
02:04:14.281 --> 02:04:16.103 line:82%
A good friend, a good boyfriend.

1381
02:04:18.034 --> 02:04:20.579 line:82%
Stop being a fan.

1382
02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:29.811 line:82%
What's the difference between us?

1383
02:04:31.673 --> 02:04:33.550 line:82%
I came from the same streets.

1384
02:04:33.592 --> 02:04:35.886 line:82%
I had normal parents, like you.

1385
02:04:36.886 --> 02:04:39.723 line:82%
A regular house, regular school,
regular friends.

1386
02:04:56.588 --> 02:04:58.356 line:82%
I made my way up on my own...

1387
02:05:00.744 --> 02:05:02.242 line:82%
not in anyone's shadow.

1388
02:05:05.373 --> 02:05:06.830 line:82%
I'm human.

1389
02:05:08.084 --> 02:05:09.502 line:82%
I laugh and cry,
and get mad like you.

1390
02:05:09.544 --> 02:05:12.923 line:82%
I have a family.
Responsibilities.

1391
02:05:12.964 --> 02:05:15.508 line:82%
I don't have time to meet all my fans.

1392
02:05:23.892 --> 02:05:25.591 line:82%
I'll say it again.

1393
02:05:27.604 --> 02:05:28.980 line:82%
I'll forget all this.

1394
02:05:30.232 --> 02:05:33.276 line:82%
You do the same.
Start over.

1395
02:05:34.846 --> 02:05:36.515 line:82%
Not as Aryan Khanna, Jr.

1396
02:05:41.368 --> 02:05:43.912 line:82%
See what it feels like
to be Gaurav Chandna.

1397
02:05:47.666 --> 02:05:48.833 line:82%
Come!

1398
02:05:54.547 --> 02:05:56.633 line:82%
The joy of living as yourself

1399
02:05:56.675 --> 02:05:59.511 line:82%
cannot be matched
by living as another.

1400
02:06:01.012 --> 02:06:02.188 line:82%
Stop now.

1401
02:06:04.099 --> 02:06:05.725 line:82%
Live your life.

1402
02:06:06.427 --> 02:06:08.270 line:82%
Let me live mine.

1403
02:06:16.444 --> 02:06:17.786 line:82%
Where do I go, Senior?

1404
02:06:19.698 --> 02:06:22.617 line:82%
You destroy me and ask me
to let you live your life?

1405
02:06:26.538 --> 02:06:27.656 line:82%
What about my life?

1406
02:06:30.125 --> 02:06:32.585 line:82%
You took everything from me.

1407
02:06:34.771 --> 02:06:36.417 line:82%
The love of my parents...

1408
02:06:37.424 --> 02:06:38.758 line:82%
Neha's friendship.

1409
02:06:40.844 --> 02:06:43.388 line:82%
My neighbors' respect.

1410
02:06:51.896 --> 02:06:54.899 line:82%
You were my lifeline, Senior.

1411
02:06:57.235 --> 02:06:58.403 line:82%
You cut the connection.

1412
02:07:00.322 --> 02:07:02.907 line:82%
Okay. I'll do as you say.

1413
02:07:05.577 --> 02:07:06.911 line:82%
I'll stop this game.

1414
02:07:11.958 --> 02:07:14.285 line:82%
I can separate myself from you.

1415
02:07:16.845 --> 02:07:21.343 line:82%
But you can never separate
my name from yours.

1416
02:07:27.182 --> 02:07:28.537 line:82%
You said everything.

1417
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:33.818 line:82%
But you never said
"I'm sorry."

1418
02:07:38.818 --> 02:07:40.570 line:82%
No! Gaurav!

1419
02:07:40.612 --> 02:07:43.823 line:82%
No, Gaurav. It's not over.

1420
02:07:43.865 --> 02:07:45.700 line:82%
Think of your parents.

1421
02:07:48.119 --> 02:07:49.120 line:82%
Stop this madness.

1422
02:08:06.888 --> 02:08:10.892 line:82%
Forget it.
You'll never understand.

1423
02:09:56.748 --> 02:10:01.127 line:82%
Aryan Khanna has cleared
his name completely.

1424
02:10:01.169 --> 02:10:05.215 line:82%
But Gaurav Chandna,
from Inder Vihar,

1425
02:10:05.256 --> 02:10:08.510 line:82%
has tied his name to superstar
Aryan's forever.

1426
02:10:08.551 --> 02:10:12.889 line:82%
A wave of love greets Aryan
today, on his birthday.

1427
02:10:12.931 --> 02:10:15.308 line:82%
Thousands of fans
have gathered...

1428
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:19.646 line:82%
-Aryan...
-...and are singing his songs.

1429
02:10:19.687 --> 02:10:20.688 line:82%
It's time.

1430
02:10:24.269 --> 02:10:25.723 line:82%
Everybody is waiting.
