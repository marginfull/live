Customer 34, your latte is ready.

2
00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:55.055 line:80%
Customer 35, your iced Americano is ready.

3
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.106 line:80%
There's no iced Americano.

4
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.524 line:80%
It went out earlier.

5
00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:08.068 line:80%
I think someone else took it.

6
00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.280 line:80%
Customer 34.

7
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:12.990 line:80%
Customer 34.

8
00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:15.326 line:80%
That's me.

9
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.621 line:80%
Where did my coffee go?

10
00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:21.373 line:80%
I'm sorry. I'll make it again.

11
00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:31.884 line:80%
If no one steals it,

12
00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:41.727 line:80%
the coffee remains there.

13
00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.940 line:80%
But if someone takes it...

14
00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:48.984 line:80%
Are you kidding me?
What do you think you're doing?

15
00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.445 line:80%
The coffee will be gone.

16
00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:05.668 line:80%
I need someone to steal my fate.

Strike. You know what that is, right?

19
00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:25.187 line:80%
When I hit the ball,

20
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:26.772 line:80%
it's game over!

21
00:02:27.565 --> 00:02:30.901 line:80%
When I hit it,
it goes out like a bowling ball!

22
00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:32.111 line:80%
They all go flying.

23
00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:35.781 line:80%
When I think about it...

24
00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:37.408 line:80%
Ji-won!

25
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.830 line:80%
If anyone,

26
00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:44.623 line:80%
it has to be you.

27
00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:49.587 line:80%
Because you just have to have
everything that's mine.

28
00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.055 line:80%
Hurry up.

29
00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:16.322 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

30
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:22.369 line:80%
Hello.

31
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.195 line:80%
Did you have a meeting outside the office?

32
00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:59.323 line:80%
Ms. Yang said you didn't come
to work today.

33
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.658 line:80%
Yes, that's right.

34
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.576 line:80%
Something came up this morning.

35
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.744 line:80%
I see.

36
00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.374 line:80%
Ji-won, are you working on your proposal?

37
00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.918 line:80%
I won't hold back if it sucks again.

38
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.003 line:80%
I'm working hard on it.

39
00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:14.630 line:80%
If you say it like that,

40
00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.632 line:80%
it sounds like she's not trying.

41
00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.134 line:80%
Ji-won works so hard.

42
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.388 line:80%
Isn't that the good coffee?

43
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.182 line:80%
From the café across the bus stop.

44
00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:27.643 line:80%
Look at this. You slacker.

45
00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.854 line:80%
You left work during working hours
to buy coffee.

46
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.231 line:80%
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:35.693 line:80%
-I got it on my way back in.
-Women never work.

48
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.152 line:80%
They only want to eat--

49
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:55.879 line:80%
-Ms. Kang?
-Yes?

50
00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.048 line:80%
Just a moment.

51
00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:12.104 line:80%
Drink your coffee.

52
00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:18.152 line:80%
Would you like this?

53
00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:20.571 line:80%
I didn't drink it yet.

54
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.992 line:80%
To be honest, I skipped breakfast.

55
00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.160 line:80%
That's why on my--

56
00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:28.287 line:80%
You should start eating breakfast.

57
00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:33.584 line:80%
Drink it.

58
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.254 line:80%
It'll be awkward for you
to drink it alone in there.

59
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.673 line:80%
That's why I called you out here.

60
00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:43.302 line:80%
Thank you.

61
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.891 line:80%
That's right.

62
00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:52.019 line:80%
I'm not quitting the company.

63
00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:58.025 line:80%
Do you want to see this?

64
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.989 line:80%
My dad gave it to me.

65
00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:06.408 line:80%
Whenever my dad gave me an allowance,

66
00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:08.494 line:80%
he always drew a heart on it.

67
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.664 line:80%
I told him not to draw on money like that,

68
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:15.709 line:80%
but I guess he couldn't suppress
his artistic soul.

69
00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:21.632 line:80%
I'm a daughter who received
this kind of fatherly love.

70
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.387 line:80%
I'm going to try harder.

71
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:36.522 line:80%
Also...

72
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.401 line:80%
You said that I was talented.

73
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:44.363 line:80%
That really helped me make up my mind.
Thank you.

74
00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:51.537 line:80%
Honestly, it's been so long.

75
00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:53.789 line:80%
I forgot what I wanted.

76
00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.126 line:80%
I've been busy just trying to get by.

77
00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.172 line:80%
But I won't live like that anymore.

78
00:07:05.843 --> 00:07:07.010 line:80%
That's a good idea.

79
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:11.265 line:80%
Did you just smile?

80
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.102 line:80%
It's my first time seeing you smile.

81
00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.529 line:80%
By any chance,

82
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.407 line:80%
do you have plans this weekend?

83
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.825 line:80%
This weekend?

84
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.749 line:80%
No.

85
00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:39.543 line:80%
-Then--
-I already made plans

86
00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.170 line:80%
with Ji-won this weekend.

87
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.882 line:80%
Did you forget already? I'm sad.

88
00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:49.469 line:80%
I booked a table at Goseuljung.
It's a great BBQ restaurant.

89
00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.015 line:80%
Goseuljung?

90
00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:54.391 line:80%
Yes. Do you know that place?

91
00:07:58.854 --> 00:08:00.355 line:80%
I've heard of it.

92
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.026 line:80%
Okay.

93
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.284 line:80%
I want that coffee too.

94
00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.452 line:80%
Let's go together.

95
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.289 line:80%
Sorry, I'm a little busy right now.

96
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.291 line:80%
Why? I want to drink it too!

97
00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.210 line:80%
The sandwiches there are good.

98
00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:31.303 line:80%
Ji-won, this is no fun.

99
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.932 line:80%
I saved you from Mr. Yu
asking you to work on the weekend,

100
00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.309 line:80%
and you can't even have coffee with me?

101
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.228 line:80%
All she does is work.

102
00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.271 line:80%
I hate it.

Yes, right now.

It's a pain reliever.

I heard you should take it
if there's any pain.

120
00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:02.686 line:80%
Did you take some?

121
00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.479 line:80%
Your injury must hurt.

122
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.567 line:80%
That's okay. I'm fine.

123
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.324 line:80%
I'm glad you're prepared,
but take care of yourself first.

124

I think you need this more than I do.

125
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.256 line:80%
Thank you.

126
00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:55.530 line:80%
Come out.

127
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:05.624 line:80%
I need Jeong Su-min to steal my fate.

128

Don't tell me...

129
00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.107 line:80%
Did you dump me for Yu Ji-hyuk?

130
00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:31.775 line:80%
What?

131
00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.986 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk is young
and he's a general manager

132
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.030 line:80%
so you think he's got power?

133
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.743 line:80%
You only know half of the story,
you sneaky vixen.

134
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:46.289 line:80%
I told you. You need to see
a man's looks and their tact.

135
00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.374 line:80%
Okay?

136
00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:51.169 line:80%
What's with that look?

137
00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.632 line:80%
You don't have something with him, do you?

138
00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.218 line:80%
I am sorry, Mr. Yu.

139
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:02.639 line:80%
Are you being like this because
he asked me to bring him a bandage?

140
00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.142 line:80%
He asked you for a bandage?

141
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.352 line:80%
That crazy old fart.

142
00:12:07.436 --> 00:12:09.479 line:80%
How could he do that to someone hurt?

143
00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:10.981 line:80%
I won't stand for this.

144
00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:15.610 line:80%
I asked to break up

145
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:21.158 line:80%
because our relationship isn't the same
as it used to be.

146
00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:25.245 line:80%
I don't know.

147
00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.830 line:80%
I don't want to tell you.

148
00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:31.251 line:80%
What is it?

149
00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:35.046 line:80%
Were you upset because you thought
my feelings for you have changed?

150
00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:38.341 line:80%
Yes.

151
00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:43.638 line:80%
I want a relationship
that everyone's envious of.

152
00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.432 line:80%
I wish you were someone

153
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.351 line:80%
that I could be proud of

154
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.062 line:80%
and any women would want to steal.

155
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.731 line:80%
What?

156
00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:56.234 line:80%
Who cares what others think?
Our feelings are what matter.

157
00:12:58.195 --> 00:13:00.155 line:80%
Ji-won. You...

158
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.824 line:80%
I thought you were being silly.
I was wrong.

159
00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.535 line:80%
Okay.

160
00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:08.038 line:80%
I'll pay more attention from now on.

161
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.040 line:80%
Let's make up.

162
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:12.709 line:80%
-Okay.
-Yeah.

163
00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:15.629 line:80%
What is it? What?

164
00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:16.713 line:80%
Let's make up.

165
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.340 line:80%
But why at work?

166
00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:19.466 line:80%
No one's coming.

167
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:20.967 line:80%
-Yes, they will.
-No.

168
00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:25.347 line:80%
Wait, I'm getting a call.

169
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.849 line:80%
It's just my mom calling to take my meds.

170
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.687 line:80%
This won't do.

171
00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.742 line:80%
Oh, hi.

172
00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:48.578 line:80%
It's resolved.

173
00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.007 line:80%
I...

174
00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.512 line:80%
I know it's not my place.

175
00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.806 line:80%
But even between lovers,

176
00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:12.310 line:80%
unwanted physical contact is bad.

177
00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.689 line:80%
So...

178
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.899 line:80%
I was just reminded of my past.

179
00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.068 line:80%
I have a lot of regrets.

180
00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.281 line:80%
You're a smart person.

181
00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.242 line:80%
Don't make mistakes like I did.

182
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.336 line:80%
Did she come
because she was worried about me?

183
00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.052 line:80%
Now, it's time for lunch.

184
00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.596 line:80%
Let's work after we eat.

185
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.140 line:80%
Ms. Yang!

186
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.933 line:80%
Did you make the reservation?

187
00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.277 line:80%
Babe, what should we eat?

188
00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:03.862 line:80%
I crave curry today.

189
00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:06.281 line:80%
Let's get Indian.

190
00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:09.409 line:80%
Sorry, I'm broke lately.

191
00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:12.203 line:80%
Also, we have stir-fried pork
at the cafeteria.

192
00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.498 line:80%
Min-hwan, take Su-min to get Indian.

193
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.587 line:80%
No, if you want to eat stir-fried pork,

194
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.047 line:80%
then I'll eat that too.

195
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.132 line:80%
Yeah, okay.

196
00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.176 line:80%
Then let's go to the cafeteria.

197
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.151 line:80%
Thank you, my other half.

198
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.327 line:80%
Here.

199
00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.089 line:80%
If things didn't go your way,

200
00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:07.509 line:80%
you'd behave perversely. I knew that.

201
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:15.308 line:80%
Let's sit there.

202
00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.148 line:80%
Come on. You should be more careful.

203
00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.317 line:80%
Ji-won, are you okay?

204
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.528 line:80%
Ji-won, are you okay?

205
00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.029 line:80%
What do we do?

206
00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.532 line:80%
I endured it because

207
00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.951 line:80%
I thought you were the only one I had.

208
00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:36.037 line:80%
-I'm sorry.
-You should've dodged it, silly.

209
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.873 line:80%
What do we do?

210
00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.380 line:80%
Let's sit over there.

211
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.353 line:80%
Come on!

212
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.897 line:80%
Damn it.

213
00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:04.941 line:80%
Damn it.

214
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.777 line:80%
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

215
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.195 line:80%
Are you okay?

216
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.823 line:80%
I'm so sorry!

217
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:14.617 line:80%
Su-min, sorry.

218
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.661 line:80%
Did you trip over my foot?

219
00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:19.539 line:80%
Babe.

220
00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:22.500 line:80%
-Are you hurt?
-Damn it.

221
00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:26.379 line:80%
Isn't this your favorite shirt?

222
00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:30.508 line:80%
Authentique?

223
00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:32.969 line:80%
It's all ruined now.

224
00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:34.345 line:80%
What do we do?

225
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:35.930 line:80%
Get me a napkin.

226
00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:38.099 line:80%
Napkin. Right.

227
00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.021 line:80%
I won't just take it anymore.

228
00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.774 line:80%
Excuse me!

229
00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:47.567 line:80%
Is someone there?

230
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:49.861 line:80%
Me?

231
00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.488 line:80%
Yes!

232
00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.656 line:80%
Can I

233
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.617 line:80%
ask you for a favor?

234
00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.579 line:80%
Do you need a sanitary pad?

235
00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.664 line:80%
Yes!

236
00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:02.749 line:80%
Yes!

237
00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.794 line:80%
Just a moment. I'll get it for you.

238
00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.590 line:80%
Thank you! Thank you so much!

239
00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:11.841 line:80%
Thank you so much!

240
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.845 line:80%
I was wondering

241
00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.390 line:80%
who saved my life,
and it's someone I already knew!

242
00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.560 line:80%
I promise to serve you properly one day!

243
00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:25.730 line:80%
There's no need for that. It was nothing.

244
00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.235 line:80%
Hui-yeon, just a second.

245
00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.778 line:80%
Excuse me.

246
00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:35.490 line:80%
I knew it.

247
00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.760 line:80%
Okay.

248
00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:57.637 line:80%
How are you so nice?

249
00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:02.392 line:80%
You're a good Samaritan.
I thought they don't exist anymore.

250
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.477 line:80%
The type of kindness
you only see in films.

251
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:08.189 line:80%
You're the light of my life!
My real savior!

252
00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.070 line:80%
Have you always been like this?

253
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.363 line:80%
Goodness.

254
00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:17.866 line:80%
You're beautiful when you smile.

255
00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.993 line:80%
Why didn't I know that?

256
00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.912 line:80%
You're beautiful and nice.

257
00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.248 line:80%
You live an impressive life.

258
00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:29.794 line:80%
You're overdoing it.

259
00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:32.046 line:80%
Other people would've done the same.

260
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.257 line:80%
No, they wouldn't.

261
00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:37.510 line:80%
Someone came in before you did,

262
00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.470 line:80%
and I sincerely asked for help.

263
00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.307 line:80%
But she just grumbled.

264
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.767 line:80%
She finished her business and left.

265
00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.521 line:80%
Thank you, my other half.

266
00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:57.071 line:80%
Have you eaten?

267
00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.656 line:80%
I haven't yet.

268
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.284 line:80%
I came down to eat unprepared.

269
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.162 line:80%
That's when I fell into a crisis.

270
00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.497 line:80%
That's right.

271
00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:10.418 line:80%
That reminds me.
Why haven't we had a meal together yet?

272
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.672 line:80%
If it's okay with you,
shall we eat together?

273
00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:26.684 line:80%
You left to get napkins.

274
00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.895 line:80%
I wondered what took you so long.

275
00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.151 line:80%
She was in an emergency too.

276
00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.153 line:80%
What kind of emergency?

277
00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.155 line:80%
Well...

278
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.658 line:80%
We figured it out too.

279
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.952 line:80%
You handled it well.

280
00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:47.038 line:80%
You think?

281
00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:51.042 line:80%
I bet Min-hwan is pissed.

282
00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:53.670 line:80%
He begged me for a year to buy that shirt.

283
00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.797 line:80%
I'm really sorry, Mr. Park.

284
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.508 line:80%
I'll buy you another one.

285
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.177 line:80%
It's fine.

286
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.845 line:80%
It's just a shirt.

287
00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.222 line:80%
Don't worry about it.

288
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.059 line:80%
Isn't that a luxury brand?

289
00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:10.645 line:80%
Isn't it 1.5 million won? No, 1.8 million?

290
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.775 line:80%
It's not that expensive.
A little over 1.2 million won.

291
00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.445 line:80%
-Well...
-What do I do?

292
00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:22.824 line:80%
I'm a contract worker,
so I don't make that much.

293
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.543 line:80%
It's fine. Don't worry about it.
Please, just eat.

294
00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.253 line:80%
Is it really okay?

295
00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:38.172 line:80%
Well, you're a really competent man, so...

296
00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:40.258 line:80%
-You're the best.
-You too, Su-min.

297
00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.052 line:80%
I should go buy a shirt.

298
00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.555 line:80%
Eat up. I have a lot of shirts at home.

299
00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.181 line:80%
You're so generous.

300
00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.767 line:80%
I wanted this to happen.
It smells so good.

301
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.563 line:80%
Mr. Park, you're the best.

302
00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:16.711 line:80%
Be careful of the fire.

303
00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.213 line:80%
Slice some more onions.

304
00:22:21.174 --> 00:22:22.508 line:80%
Good. Keep going.

305
00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:23.843 line:80%
Hey, this is burning.

306
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:27.138 line:80%
It'll burn if you leave it. Do it again.

307
00:22:46.491 --> 00:22:47.867 line:80%
Thank you for coming.

308
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:48.951 line:80%
It's so good.

309
00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:50.036 line:80%
Thank you.

310
00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:07.595 line:80%
Chef Baek Eun-ho.

311
00:23:09.263 --> 00:23:10.681 line:80%
Yes?

312
00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:15.978 line:80%
Did you graduate
from Busan's Taeha High School?

313
00:23:16.938 --> 00:23:19.023 line:80%
Yes, I did.

314
00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:28.199 line:80%
Hui-yeon, you've got quite the appetite.

315
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.535 line:80%
You really do.

316
00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:33.246 line:80%
How can a woman eat so much?

317
00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:35.540 line:80%
Women or men,

318
00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:38.084 line:80%
we must eat a lot to do important work.

319
00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:40.044 line:80%
My grandfather taught me this.

320
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.507 line:80%
So? Does your grandfather
do important work?

321
00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.426 line:80%
He sells bean sprouts.

322
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.928 line:80%
Tofu and seasonings too.

323
00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:53.641 line:80%
So he sells side dishes.

324
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.353 line:80%
You must be energetic
thanks to him, Hui-yeon.

325
00:23:57.436 --> 00:23:59.522 line:80%
Koreans get their energy from rice.

326
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.482 line:80%
That's right!

327
00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:05.069 line:80%
As a picky eater, I'm doomed.

328
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:08.406 line:80%
How will you work after eating that?

329
00:24:08.489 --> 00:24:09.740 line:80%
You eat too little.

330
00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:11.534 line:80%
I know.

331
00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:13.619 line:80%
I should eat well like Ji-won.

332
00:24:13.703 --> 00:24:15.079 line:80%
Come to think of it,

333
00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:17.582 line:80%
Ji-won was always able to eat everything.

334
00:24:17.999 --> 00:24:20.084 line:80%
She could digest steel.

335
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:23.421 line:80%
-Right, Ji-won?
-Yes.

336
00:24:24.005 --> 00:24:25.089 line:80%
Is that true?

337
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.885 line:80%
I remember when she ate pork
gukbap
.

338
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:30.428 line:80%
She eats like an old man.

339
00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:32.471 line:80%
She was gobbling it up.

340
00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:34.015 line:80%
Hey, old man!

341
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:37.476 line:80%
Min-hwan, you shouldn't say that.

342
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.270 line:80%
You need to love her no matter what.

343
00:24:39.353 --> 00:24:40.563 line:80%
Love.

344
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.648 line:80%
Right. Love's important.

345
00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:47.403 line:80%
You're lucky to have a friend like that.

346
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:53.659 line:80%
Yeah, Su-min's the best.

347
00:24:53.743 --> 00:24:54.994 line:80%
Why do men...

348
00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:57.580 line:80%
I'll bring you some water.

349
00:24:58.164 --> 00:25:00.291 line:80%
-Mine too.
-What? Why should I?

350
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:02.501 line:80%
Since you're going anyway.

351
00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:05.296 line:80%
-Mine too--
-Since you came to work anyway,

352
00:25:05.379 --> 00:25:06.797 line:80%
could you do my job too?

353
00:25:10.927 --> 00:25:12.053 line:80%
What the...

354
00:25:12.637 --> 00:25:13.888 line:80%
That little...

355
00:25:14.889 --> 00:25:17.558 line:80%
How dare that little chick talk like that?

356
00:25:18.601 --> 00:25:20.144 line:80%
Don't call her like that.

357
00:25:21.103 --> 00:25:22.438 line:80%
We're at work.

358
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:25.107 line:80%
She's young,
but she's the same rank as you.

359
00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:27.360 line:80%
What?

360
00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:33.908 line:80%
Well...

361
00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:37.119 line:80%
Still, I'll talk to her.

362
00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:39.163 line:80%
Yeah. Talk to her, will you?

363
00:25:39.247 --> 00:25:41.749 line:80%
She's so rude. Unbelievable.

364
00:25:41.832 --> 00:25:45.044 line:80%
Finish it up with Su-min.
I'll see you upstairs.

365
00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:46.921 line:80%
You know she's a picky eater.

366
00:25:47.004 --> 00:25:49.090 line:80%
She won't eat unless someone helps.

367
00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:50.299 line:80%
She's not like me.

368
00:25:51.634 --> 00:25:52.802 line:80%
Sure, okay.

369
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:54.804 line:80%
See you later.

370
00:26:05.398 --> 00:26:06.983 line:80%
Hui-yeon, I'm sorry.

371
00:26:07.066 --> 00:26:09.318 line:80%
I cleared your tray. Are you okay?

372
00:26:09.402 --> 00:26:11.946 line:80%
I'm so sorry. I should've held it in.

373
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.660 line:80%
I saw it right away.

374
00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:20.121 line:80%
The woman who ignored me in the restroom

375
00:26:20.288 --> 00:26:21.372 line:80%
was Jeong Su-min.

376
00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:27.962 line:80%
Hi, stranger who just came in.

377
00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:31.090 line:80%
By chance, can you help me?

378
00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:34.427 line:80%
Why would she ask for help?
She should've come prepared.

379
00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:37.471 line:80%
Such a nuisance!

380
00:26:43.853 --> 00:26:46.105 line:80%
Shall we get coffee after the meeting?

381
00:26:46.188 --> 00:26:48.566 line:80%
-I'll buy!
-I said I'd buy.

382
00:26:57.491 --> 00:26:59.160 line:80%
I think Ji-won is angry.

383
00:27:00.494 --> 00:27:03.247 line:80%
I think it's because I ruined your shirt.

384
00:27:04.915 --> 00:27:06.167 line:80%
Come on.

385
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.210 line:80%
You know she's not like that.

386
00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:11.380 line:80%
She was worried about how you eat earlier.

387
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:13.883 line:80%
She cares about you so much.

388
00:27:14.842 --> 00:27:16.052 line:80%
You think so?

389
00:27:18.095 --> 00:27:20.389 line:80%
Ji-won's so indifferent sometimes.

390
00:27:21.724 --> 00:27:24.435 line:80%
She doesn't know how much I like her.

391
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:30.483 line:80%
Come on.

392
00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:32.109 line:80%
It's really okay.

393
00:27:34.487 --> 00:27:36.447 line:80%
-Let's go.
-Go in.

394
00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:39.700 line:80%
Goodness!

395
00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:45.539 line:80%
My hands...

396
00:27:45.623 --> 00:27:47.416 line:80%
Right.

397
00:27:58.177 --> 00:27:59.261 line:80%
This...

398
00:28:01.263 --> 00:28:02.681 line:80%
What do we do about it?

399
00:28:03.474 --> 00:28:04.642 line:80%
Right, well...

400
00:28:08.771 --> 00:28:10.815 line:80%
No, wait.

401
00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:12.525 line:80%
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

402
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.151 line:80%
Sorry about that.

403
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.241 line:80%
What perfume

404
00:28:22.118 --> 00:28:23.452 line:80%
do you use?

405
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.080 line:80%
This is...

406
00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:30.209 line:80%
You smell nice.

407
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:31.544 line:80%
Yeah, well...

408
00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:46.475 line:80%
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

409
00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:48.477 line:80%
Okay.

410
00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:51.439 line:80%
What do you think you're doing?

411
00:28:53.274 --> 00:28:54.733 line:80%
Excuse me?

412
00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:57.987 line:80%
These are the materials for the meeting.

413
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.323 line:80%
I told you not to do this.

414
00:29:01.699 --> 00:29:02.950 line:80%
Well?

415
00:29:03.534 --> 00:29:05.911 line:80%
Let's be honest.

416
00:29:06.412 --> 00:29:08.622 line:80%
The proposals you all write are lame.

417
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.041 line:80%
Just show some sincerity

418
00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:13.544 line:80%
so we can have a meeting in peace!

419
00:29:14.044 --> 00:29:16.755 line:80%
Does this make sense to you?

420
00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:19.175 line:80%
-Does it?
-Those who are incompetent focus

421
00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:22.845 line:80%
on the little things they know
and make a huge deal out of it.

422
00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:25.556 line:80%
Yes, it does look insincere.

423
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.018 line:80%
Hui-yeon, you have to staple it

424
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:30.519 line:80%
like this.

425
00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:32.229 line:80%
At an angle.

426
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.273 line:80%
Stapler?

427
00:29:34.857 --> 00:29:36.233 line:80%
Exactly my point.

428
00:29:36.317 --> 00:29:38.319 line:80%
Su-min, you know your stuff.

429
00:29:39.862 --> 00:29:41.697 line:80%
Go print and staple them again.

430
00:29:43.908 --> 00:29:45.534 line:80%
All of this?

431
00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:49.371 line:80%
It's such a waste of paper.

432
00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:52.625 line:80%
Several trees were wasted because of you.

433
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:54.793 line:80%
I want you to understand that!

434
00:29:54.877 --> 00:29:56.045 line:80%
Sir.

435
00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:58.756 line:80%
I'm sure Ms. Yang understood.

436
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:03.219 line:80%
Ji-won, get the manager some coffee.

437
00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:07.139 line:80%
Sir.

438
00:30:07.223 --> 00:30:10.142 line:80%
Will you take a look at my proposal?

439
00:30:10.726 --> 00:30:13.020 line:80%
I need to become a full-time employee.

440
00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:15.523 line:80%
Shall we go and get some air?

441
00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.358 line:80%
Shall we?

442
00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:27.576 line:80%
I'm so sorry, Ms. Yang.

443
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.161 line:80%
I didn't know.

444
00:30:29.245 --> 00:30:30.996 line:80%
Don't worry about it.

445
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.498 line:80%
It's okay.

446
00:30:39.046 --> 00:30:40.673 line:80%
I can't leave it like this.

447
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.761 line:80%
Ms. Yang.

448
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:47.680 line:80%
Do you want to get some coffee?

449
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:51.684 line:80%
Mr. Kim asked me to do something.

450
00:30:52.268 --> 00:30:53.727 line:80%
Just for a second.

451
00:30:55.771 --> 00:30:59.149 line:80%
You're being kind of weird.

452
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:00.859 line:80%
Next time.

453
00:31:00.943 --> 00:31:04.238 line:80%
Then take a look at this for me at least.

454
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:07.908 line:80%
Single household?

455
00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:12.079 line:80%
Isn't this the proposal Mr. Kim rejected?

456
00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:14.832 line:80%
What's the point of me looking at this?

457
00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:17.585 line:80%
Read it for me.

458
00:31:17.668 --> 00:31:20.546 line:80%
If you still don't have time,
it can't be helped.

459
00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:22.548 line:80%
Bye.

460
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.555 line:80%
You scared me!

461
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.766 line:80%
Where are you running from?

462
00:31:34.018 --> 00:31:35.019 line:80%
Well...

463
00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:39.481 line:80%
The meeting's over.
Let's slack off after I use the restroom.

464
00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:41.775 line:80%
Wait.

465
00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:46.155 line:80%
Min-hwan said he needed to talk to me.

466
00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:47.489 line:80%
Let's chat later.

467
00:31:51.285 --> 00:31:54.872 line:80%
MEAL KIT PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS

468
00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:19.855 line:80%
PAIN RELIEVER

469
00:32:45.047 --> 00:32:46.674 line:80%
Hui-yeon, something came up.

470
00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:48.801 line:80%
I have to go back to the office.

471
00:32:50.803 --> 00:32:53.305 line:80%
You want me to eat all of this on my own?

472
00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:03.148 line:80%
I can't keep receiving like this from you!

473
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:08.028 line:80%
Could you hang out with me
this Sunday so I can pay back?

474
00:33:08.112 --> 00:33:09.029 line:80%
I'll buy!

475
00:33:10.197 --> 00:33:11.365 line:80%
Sunday?

476
00:33:11.448 --> 00:33:13.867 line:80%
In return, let's hang out this weekend.

477
00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:17.329 line:80%
I found a yummy BBQ restaurant.
It's called Goseuljung.

478
00:33:18.622 --> 00:33:20.416 line:80%
I don't think I can do Sunday.

479
00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.418 line:80%
Do you have plans?

480
00:33:24.086 --> 00:33:25.754 line:80%
I do have plans,

481
00:33:25.838 --> 00:33:27.881 line:80%
but I don't think I'm going to go.

482
00:33:27.965 --> 00:33:29.466 line:80%
You don't have to go?

483
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.510 line:80%
What kind of plan is it?

484
00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:35.305 line:80%
A school reunion.

485
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:37.349 line:80%
Then you have to go.

486
00:33:37.433 --> 00:33:40.018 line:80%
You should go to see your first love,

487
00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:41.270 line:80%
and be disappointed

488
00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:43.480 line:80%
so you can move on with your life.

489
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.025 line:80%
No one knows where my first love lives

490
00:33:47.109 --> 00:33:48.694 line:80%
or where he is.

491
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.114 line:80%
I wasn't very popular in school.

492
00:33:53.824 --> 00:33:57.536 line:80%
Is there any reason for me to go
and dig up my shameful past?

493
00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:59.580 line:80%
Isn't that more the reason to go?

494
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:06.336 line:80%
If you don't go,
it'll remain a shameful past.

495
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.965 line:80%
But if you go and fix it,
it'll become your history!

496
00:34:32.112 --> 00:34:33.572 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

497
00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:36.325 line:80%
Yes?

498
00:34:39.453 --> 00:34:42.539 line:80%
You asked me if I was free on Sunday.

499
00:34:42.873 --> 00:34:44.917 line:80%
If it's urgent, I'll come to work.

500
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:46.835 line:80%
Didn't you have plans?

501
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.505 line:80%
I do.

502
00:34:50.714 --> 00:34:53.175 line:80%
But it's not important. Work comes first.

503
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.551 line:80%
I think that's right.

504
00:34:55.928 --> 00:34:57.346 line:80%
You come first, Ms. Kang.

505
00:35:01.809 --> 00:35:03.018 line:80%
Well...

506
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:08.232 line:80%
To be honest, I was debating
whether or not I wanted to go.

507
00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:10.275 line:80%
Go.

508
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:14.071 line:80%
Your answer will differ depending
on the situation,

509
00:35:14.154 --> 00:35:15.697 line:80%
but just try it this time.

510
00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:17.449 line:80%
You can go.

511
00:35:21.328 --> 00:35:23.163 line:80%
Just remember that you owe me.

512
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:25.791 line:80%
What?

513
00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:45.435 line:80%
BASIC NUTRITION FOR MEAL KIT

514
00:35:49.439 --> 00:35:50.941 line:80%
Read it for me.

515
00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:53.861 line:80%
If you really don't have time,
that's okay too.

516
00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:55.612 line:80%
This is good.

517
00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:58.156 line:80%
Ms. Yang?

518
00:36:02.035 --> 00:36:03.328 line:80%
Did you read it?

519
00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:05.789 line:80%
Yes.

520
00:36:05.873 --> 00:36:07.708 line:80%
I read over it.

521
00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:08.917 line:80%
It's good.

522
00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:15.090 line:80%
Do you want to do it together?

523
00:36:19.845 --> 00:36:23.181 line:80%
That's not how things work in the company.

524
00:36:23.974 --> 00:36:26.727 line:80%
Mr. Kim has
a different perspective than us--

525
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.604 line:80%
He didn't even read it.

526
00:36:29.813 --> 00:36:31.523 line:80%
-What?
-I saw him.

527
00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:37.362 line:80%
He pretended to flip through it.

528
00:36:40.616 --> 00:36:42.034 line:80%
He pretended to read it.

529
00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:43.952 line:80%
This isn't the first.

530
00:36:44.036 --> 00:36:46.288 line:80%
When it comes to your work,

531
00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:48.332 line:80%
he shoots everything down.

532
00:36:53.337 --> 00:36:54.588 line:80%
We already know this.

533
00:37:03.472 --> 00:37:05.515 line:80%
Look at the manager. Unbelievable.

534
00:37:06.016 --> 00:37:07.893 line:80%
He thinks that's power.

535
00:37:09.645 --> 00:37:10.896 line:80%
No way.

536
00:37:12.439 --> 00:37:16.109 line:80%
You lose objectivity
if you've been gaslit for too long.

537
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:18.820 line:80%
Aside from everything else,

538
00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:20.781 line:80%
aside from his perspective,

539
00:37:22.157 --> 00:37:23.575 line:80%
what do you think?

540
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:27.871 line:80%
Do you think my proposal is ridiculous?
Really?

541
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:34.586 line:80%
Then I'll talk it over with Mr. Kim.

542
00:37:37.965 --> 00:37:39.466 line:80%
Manager Kim Gyeong-uk...

543
00:37:58.777 --> 00:38:01.697 line:80%
She's getting on my nerves lately.

544
00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:06.952 line:80%
You scared me!

545
00:38:07.035 --> 00:38:08.495 line:80%
Mr. Kim!

546
00:38:08.996 --> 00:38:10.539 line:80%
Did you enjoy your lunch?

547
00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:12.749 line:80%
If it isn't our pretty Su-min.

548
00:38:12.833 --> 00:38:15.002 line:80%
I had something good for my stamina.

549
00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:17.796 line:80%
What about you?

550
00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:21.049 line:80%
I had the stir-fried pork
in the cafeteria.

551
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:22.759 line:80%
That sounds good.

552
00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:27.431 line:80%
By the way,

553
00:38:27.514 --> 00:38:32.102 line:80%
I have a secret to tell you, Mr. Kim.

554
00:38:32.686 --> 00:38:34.229 line:80%
A secret?

555
00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:38.066 line:80%
I must get a full-time position, you know.

556
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:42.320 line:80%
I have this idea,
and I can't seem to organize my thoughts.

557
00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:45.866 line:80%
I can help you with that.

558
00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.118 line:80%
Really?

559
00:38:48.201 --> 00:38:49.536 line:80%
Thank you so much.

560
00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:51.246 line:80%
It's nothing.

561
00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:54.458 line:80%
There are so many hags and ugly women
at this company.

562
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:57.085 line:80%
That's just discouraging for our team.

563
00:38:57.169 --> 00:39:00.005 line:80%
We urgently need
a full-time employee like you.

564
00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.091 line:80%
Stop it.

565
00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:04.968 line:80%
You're so funny.

566
00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:10.807 line:80%
You know he only does
what he wants at work.

567
00:39:11.308 --> 00:39:13.769 line:80%
That's why he opposes everything you say.

568
00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:22.069 line:80%
Ever since he hit on you
and you turned him down.

569
00:39:24.321 --> 00:39:27.324 line:80%
What are you saying? That's so immature.

570
00:39:27.908 --> 00:39:31.411 line:80%
Kim Gyeong-uk has been immature
for the past seven years.

571
00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:35.415 line:80%
I know he was promoted to a manager

572
00:39:35.499 --> 00:39:38.502 line:80%
after he turned in your proposal

573
00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:39.836 line:80%
with his name on it.

574
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.296 line:80%
Just like Jeong Su-min

575
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:44.508 line:80%
became a full-time employee
with my proposal.

576
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:46.301 line:80%
He was my superior.

577
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:51.723 line:80%
It's normal that the boss takes credit
for the entire team's work--

578
00:39:51.807 --> 00:39:53.683 line:80%
But you've never done that.

579
00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:59.564 line:80%
I'm confident in this proposal.

580
00:40:00.232 --> 00:40:03.151 line:80%
You know this is a good proposal.

581
00:40:06.029 --> 00:40:07.781 line:80%
But Mr. Kim...

582
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:11.785 line:80%
My proposal was rejected on Monday.

583
00:40:11.868 --> 00:40:13.829 line:80%
I'll turn it in again as is.

584
00:40:14.121 --> 00:40:15.122 line:80%
What?

585
00:40:15.205 --> 00:40:18.208 line:80%
Once you're sure he rejected it
without reading it,

586
00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:19.835 line:80%
then...

587
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.254 line:80%
will you join me?

588
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.986 line:80%
I'm 100% sure he didn't read it.

589
00:40:50.282 --> 00:40:53.243 line:80%
No, maybe 99%?

590
00:40:54.703 --> 00:40:57.080 line:80%
I'm sure Kim Gyeong-uk didn't read it.

591
00:40:57.164 --> 00:41:01.334 line:80%
However, if he remembers
any of the charts or images...

592
00:41:01.418 --> 00:41:02.711 line:80%
DATING BIBLE

593
00:41:04.004 --> 00:41:05.630 line:80%
Don't be scared. I'm right.

594
00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:10.468 line:80%
I know that he's lazy and doesn't work.

595
00:41:23.315 --> 00:41:25.817 line:80%
Mr. Kim, will you look over this?

596
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:27.152 line:80%
It's a new proposal.

The proposal you gave me last time...

604
00:42:13.865 --> 00:42:15.617 line:80%
I don't believe this.

605
00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:19.037 line:80%
The proposal you gave me last time...

606
00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:21.206 line:80%
was much better than this!

607
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.090 line:80%
Come on.

608
00:42:30.173 --> 00:42:33.134 line:80%
I've seen bad workers,
but you're just terrible.

609
00:42:33.218 --> 00:42:35.095 line:80%
How could you suck this bad?

610
00:42:35.679 --> 00:42:38.807 line:80%
It's so obvious you copied
and pasted them together!

611
00:42:39.391 --> 00:42:43.311 line:80%
Quit if you don't want to work
instead of torturing me like this!

612
00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:51.695 line:80%
Mr. Kim, I'm so sorry.

613
00:42:52.195 --> 00:42:53.613 line:80%
It's the same proposal.

614
00:42:53.697 --> 00:42:55.657 line:80%
I'll reprint it. Just a moment.

615
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.000 line:80%
Here it is. The green one.

616
00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:07.502 line:80%
I'm so sorry, Mr. Kim.

617
00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:13.341 line:80%
He didn't recognize
that it was the same one?

618
00:43:13.425 --> 00:43:15.302 line:80%
He really doesn't work, does he?

619
00:43:15.385 --> 00:43:17.387 line:80%
He never fails to disappoint.

620
00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:46.291 line:80%
I can't believe
that he really didn't know.

621
00:43:46.374 --> 00:43:48.710 line:80%
I mean, even the title was the same.

622
00:43:48.793 --> 00:43:50.420 line:80%
I told you he didn't work.

623
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:53.089 line:80%
We're on the same team now.

624
00:43:53.298 --> 00:43:55.383 line:80%
The meal kits are going to be huge.

625
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:58.636 line:80%
Quick, easy,
and delicious meals for consumers.

626
00:44:01.222 --> 00:44:02.432 line:80%
Okay.

627
00:44:02.515 --> 00:44:06.186 line:80%
Now I get why things never went my way.

628
00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:07.771 line:80%
I can't believe it.

629
00:44:07.854 --> 00:44:10.565 line:80%
How did I trust and work
for someone like him?

630
00:44:12.359 --> 00:44:13.902 line:80%
Why didn't you invite me?

631
00:44:17.364 --> 00:44:18.615 line:80%
Cheers.

632
00:44:22.327 --> 00:44:24.954 line:80%
I can't believe Mr. Kim.
How did he not know?

633
00:44:36.883 --> 00:44:39.010 line:80%
"Meal kits for single households."

Cheers.

637
00:44:57.987 --> 00:45:00.573 line:80%
Why did you ask me out
on a date after work?

638
00:45:03.118 --> 00:45:07.372 line:80%
It's because of the secret
I told you about at work today.

639
00:45:08.456 --> 00:45:10.458 line:80%
The word, "secret"

640
00:45:10.542 --> 00:45:11.960 line:80%
gets me so excited.

641
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:18.550 line:80%
Is pork belly okay?

642
00:45:20.677 --> 00:45:21.678 line:80%
Oh, right.

643
00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:23.763 line:80%
Didn't you eat pork for lunch?

644
00:45:23.847 --> 00:45:26.015 line:80%
Then it's two pork meals in a row.

645
00:45:26.099 --> 00:45:27.600 line:80%
Does that suck for you?

646
00:45:28.518 --> 00:45:29.519 line:80%
No.

647
00:45:29.602 --> 00:45:31.896 line:80%
Korean pork is better than Korean beef.

648
00:45:32.063 --> 00:45:33.398 line:80%
You have good taste.

650
00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:36.734 line:80%
Su-min, you're such a decent woman.

651
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:39.154 line:80%
Stop it.

652
00:45:39.237 --> 00:45:41.739 line:80%
Ji-won is a really decent woman.

653
00:45:45.452 --> 00:45:46.911 line:80%
You always bring her up.

654
00:45:46.995 --> 00:45:49.998 line:80%
Do you like her that much?
I can't understand women.

655
00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:51.291 line:80%
Someone like Ji-won

656
00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:55.086 line:80%
is different from us.
She went to Hankuk University.

657
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.671 line:80%
She's smart.

658
00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:58.006 line:80%

she's ambitious.

660
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.135 line:80%
Hankuk University? So what?

661
00:46:02.218 --> 00:46:05.638 line:80%
Kids from there only know how to study.
They're worthless.

662
00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:08.683 line:80%
Her proposal was ridiculous.
Not realistic at all.

663
00:46:09.142 --> 00:46:11.644 line:80%
But I bet she doesn't think that way.

664
00:46:11.728 --> 00:46:14.814 line:80%
She'll say you won't appreciate it
and has bad taste.

665
00:46:14.898 --> 00:46:16.441 line:80%
That's what she'll think.

666
00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:18.776 line:80%
I have bad taste?

667
00:46:22.906 --> 00:46:26.284 line:80%
You must be a bit insecure
about your academic background.

668
00:46:26.743 --> 00:46:28.119 line:80%
Don't be like that.

669
00:46:28.203 --> 00:46:29.245 line:80%
University?

670
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:30.872 line:80%
It's all pointless.

671
00:46:31.414 --> 00:46:32.415 line:80%
I mean,

672
00:46:33.666 --> 00:46:36.044 line:80%
I'm just saying her idea could be good.

673
00:46:37.337 --> 00:46:39.047 line:80%
Implementing it is different.

674
00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:41.841 line:80%
That Kang Ji-won.

675
00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:43.885 line:80%
She was always so stiff.

676
00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:46.387 line:80%
She's the type to think that way, is she?

677
00:46:47.514 --> 00:46:52.185 line:80%
Still, the meal kit proposal
she printed wrong by accident...

678
00:46:53.186 --> 00:46:55.730 line:80%
It's a mess, but the idea was good.

679
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:57.524 line:80%
You should take it.

680
00:46:57.607 --> 00:46:59.692 line:80%
We could develop it together.

681
00:47:02.237 --> 00:47:03.655 line:80%
I think it'll be a hit!

682
00:47:05.573 --> 00:47:06.533 line:80%
With you?

683
00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:09.536 line:80%
-Together?
-Yes.

684
00:47:10.745 --> 00:47:13.498 line:80%
Jiwon will probably sidetrack and ruin it.

685
00:47:13.581 --> 00:47:16.918 line:80%
If we develop it
with your skills and experience,

686
00:47:18.711 --> 00:47:22.382 line:80%
I feel like this could be my ticket
to a full-time offer.

687
00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:30.098 line:80%
I must feel so comfortable around you.

688
00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:33.434 line:80%
I talk to you
as if we're more than just coworkers.

689
00:47:36.104 --> 00:47:37.522 line:80%
Did she just say

690
00:47:38.731 --> 00:47:40.024 line:80%
what I think she said?

691
00:47:47.991 --> 00:47:50.410 line:80%
Of course. Sure. Yeah.

692
00:47:50.493 --> 00:47:53.162 line:80%
I mean, we are outside of work.

693
00:47:54.372 --> 00:47:55.498 line:80%
Here.

694
00:47:55.582 --> 00:47:57.208 line:80%
Go ahead, Su-min.

695
00:47:57.292 --> 00:47:59.794 line:80%
Talk to me more about this proposal.

696
00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:01.588 line:80%
Sure.

697
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:04.340 line:80%
Let's drink first.

698
00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:06.509 line:80%
Cheers.

699
00:48:10.805 --> 00:48:13.600 line:80%
Here comes the meat!

700
00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:17.687 line:80%
Nice shot!

701
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.609 line:80%
Why is she Ji-won's friend?

702
00:48:22.692 --> 00:48:24.819 line:80%
I can't even try anything.

703
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.863 line:80%
Does it matter?

704
00:48:26.946 --> 00:48:29.866 line:80%
It sounds like she's into you too.
Just go for it.

705
00:48:30.575 --> 00:48:33.286 line:80%
What? This is not some kind
of a second-hand sale.

706
00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:35.413 line:80%
Don't be stupid.

707
00:48:35.955 --> 00:48:37.081 line:80%
Was that a strike?

708
00:48:37.165 --> 00:48:38.291 line:80%
That was amazing.

709
00:48:39.417 --> 00:48:40.668 line:80%
Nice shot!

710
00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:42.253 line:80%
Nice shot!

711
00:48:49.802 --> 00:48:51.054 line:80%
Sang-jong.

712
00:48:51.137 --> 00:48:52.555 line:80%
Do you know any girls?

713
00:48:52.639 --> 00:48:53.848 line:80%
I'm going crazy.

714
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:55.516 line:80%
Jeez.

715
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.935 line:80%
You're too energetic for Friday.

716
00:48:58.019 --> 00:48:59.395 line:80%
Where's your girl?

717
00:48:59.479 --> 00:49:01.856 line:80%
Why would you bring me down like that?

718
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.983 line:80%
She's just marriage material!

719
00:49:05.193 --> 00:49:06.569 line:80%
What's that?

720
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.821 line:80%
Listen.

721
00:49:08.905 --> 00:49:13.159 line:80%
She's nice, frugal,
and she takes care of my parents.

722
00:49:13.493 --> 00:49:16.496 line:80%
And she works hard for money,
but doesn't spend it.

723
00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:17.664 line:80%
-How's that?
-Wow.

724
00:49:17.747 --> 00:49:20.124 line:80%
That's a perfect wife.

725
00:49:20.208 --> 00:49:22.669 line:80%
She's perfectly boring too!

726
00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:26.089 line:80%
She reads the company outlook report.

727
00:49:26.172 --> 00:49:27.924 line:80%
Nobody reads that.

728
00:49:29.175 --> 00:49:32.887 line:80%
I bet she's at work
looking over documents right now.

729
00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:35.348 line:80%
Like this.

730
00:49:44.065 --> 00:49:47.318 line:80%
Getting a second chance in life
means I can do anything.

731
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:50.321 line:80%
I managed to get back at Su-min

732
00:49:50.405 --> 00:49:51.656 line:80%
and also Kim Gyeong-uk.

733
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:54.534 line:80%
I can do anything.

734
00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:28.735 line:80%
It's a matching item. Wear it on Sunday.

735
00:50:28.818 --> 00:50:30.653 line:80%
Your eternal love, Su-min!

736
00:50:31.988 --> 00:50:33.531 line:80%
Did you see her earrings?

737
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.254 line:80%
You've been so distant lately. I'm upset.

738
00:50:48.337 --> 00:50:50.506 line:80%
I'm not saying it because I'm drunk.

739
00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.133 line:80%
I'm sleeping over tonight.

740
00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:55.803 line:80%
Let's spend the weekend together
before going to Goseuljung.

741
00:50:57.221 --> 00:51:00.308 line:80%
GOSEULJUNG

742
00:51:00.391 --> 00:51:01.768 line:80%
Goseuljung.

743
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:03.644 line:80%
I'm sure of it.

744
00:51:07.273 --> 00:51:10.735 line:80%
GOSEULJUNG

745
00:51:19.744 --> 00:51:21.746 line:80%
BUSAN TAEHA HIGH SCHOOL'S 37TH REUNION

746
00:51:29.462 --> 00:51:30.963 line:80%
She really came.

747
00:51:31.047 --> 00:51:32.048 line:80%
Ji-won!

748
00:51:32.965 --> 00:51:34.884 line:80%
Ji-won, you came! Hey!

749
00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:36.093 line:80%
Let's go inside.

750
00:51:36.177 --> 00:51:37.178 line:80%
What is this?

751
00:51:38.304 --> 00:51:40.181 line:80%
Are we not eating alone?

752
00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:43.142 line:80%
I didn't think you'd come
if I told you about it.

753
00:51:43.935 --> 00:51:46.771 line:80%
We're over 30 now. Forget about the past.

754
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:48.397 line:80%
Our friends are all nice.

755
00:51:48.481 --> 00:51:50.107 line:80%
-Let's go.
-Su-min, I...

756
00:51:50.191 --> 00:51:51.234 line:80%
No.

757
00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:02.161 line:80%
I'm going to leave. Will you bring my bag?

758
00:52:02.245 --> 00:52:04.539 line:80%
Kang Ji-won is incredible.

759
00:52:04.622 --> 00:52:06.999 line:80%
Why did she come? She has no friends here.

760
00:52:07.083 --> 00:52:08.459 line:80%
She must be here to eat.

761
00:52:08.543 --> 00:52:11.087 line:80%
Did you see her? She looks so poor.

762
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:14.632 line:80%
Why are you talking like
you're from Seoul? It's weird.

763
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:18.469 line:80%
Still, how is she still hanging out
with Su-min?

764
00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:20.096 line:80%
Isn't it obvious?

765
00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:23.432 line:80%
Su-min, that softie is
just too nice to her.

766
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:27.103 line:80%
She couldn't eat at a place like this
without her.

767
00:52:27.645 --> 00:52:28.813 line:80%
Drink some milk!

768
00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:39.532 line:80%
Stop it!

769
00:52:47.248 --> 00:52:50.585 line:80%
Su-min is just too nice.

770
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:52.378 line:80%
We should take care of her.

771
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:54.005 line:80%
Did you see her earrings?

772
00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:55.631 line:80%
She copied Su-min's style.

773
00:52:55.715 --> 00:52:58.342 line:80%
I could tell it was fake from a mile away.

774
00:53:00.219 --> 00:53:03.097 line:80%
Ever since high school, Ji-won--

775
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.432 line:80%
Ye-ji, wait.

776
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:06.684 line:80%
What?

777
00:53:06.767 --> 00:53:09.061 line:80%
Ji-won wasn't at her seat earlier.

778
00:53:39.634 --> 00:53:41.928 line:80%
Were you here all this time?

779
00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:45.723 line:80%
Why did you pretend like you weren't?

780
00:53:47.767 --> 00:53:49.977 line:80%
You sly little thing.

781
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:58.319 line:80%
There's no way I'm going there.

782
00:54:00.321 --> 00:54:02.239 line:80%
No, don't come. I'm not...

783
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.910 line:80%
I'm coming over tonight.

784
00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:08.621 line:80%
I had a drink, and I miss my love.

785
00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:10.206 line:80%
I'll be there in an hour.

786
00:54:13.209 --> 00:54:16.587 line:80%
Do they think my place is
a motel or something?

787
00:54:17.672 --> 00:54:18.756 line:80%
Those two...

788
00:54:20.299 --> 00:54:21.342 line:80%
Wait.

789
00:54:27.098 --> 00:54:28.140 line:80%
Actually,

790
00:54:28.224 --> 00:54:30.643 line:80%
it's going to happen anyway. So why wait?

791
00:54:32.269 --> 00:54:34.563 line:80%
That passionate love of yours...

792
00:54:36.315 --> 00:54:38.442 line:80%
I'll help make it come true.

793
00:55:03.551 --> 00:55:05.136 line:80%
You can use this gate.

794
00:55:06.929 --> 00:55:08.472 line:80%
Thank you.

795
00:55:10.266 --> 00:55:11.517 line:80%
Are you just leaving?

796
00:55:12.018 --> 00:55:14.687 line:80%
Yes. Are you just getting back to work?

797
00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.857 line:80%
I have some things to do.

798
00:55:20.234 --> 00:55:22.319 line:80%
Goodbye. I should get going now.

799
00:55:23.362 --> 00:55:24.447 line:80%
Wait.

800
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:36.751 line:80%
This?

801
00:55:39.378 --> 00:55:40.546 line:80%
I got it as a gift.

802
00:55:44.008 --> 00:55:45.301 line:80%
That's...

803
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.722 line:80%
a replica brand.

804
00:55:51.766 --> 00:55:53.559 line:80%
People who know can tell.

805
00:56:02.735 --> 00:56:03.736 line:80%
That's...

806
00:56:05.404 --> 00:56:06.530 line:80%
a replica brand.

807
00:56:10.785 --> 00:56:12.286 line:80%
People who know can tell.

808
00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:14.538 line:80%
Me?

809
00:56:14.622 --> 00:56:16.082 line:80%
What do you mean?

810
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.003 line:80%
You shouldn't wear those.

811
00:56:21.504 --> 00:56:23.005 line:80%
You shouldn't wear those.

812
00:56:23.798 --> 00:56:25.257 line:80%
I remember.

813
00:56:26.467 --> 00:56:29.595 line:80%
He said this to me before,
and I thought he was rude.

814
00:56:30.429 --> 00:56:34.391 line:80%
That's because I didn't know what would
happen to me at the reunion.

815
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:38.771 line:80%
It was a gift from a friend,
so I thought his comment was rude.

816
00:56:40.272 --> 00:56:41.482 line:80%
I'm sorry.

817
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:42.983 line:80%
No.

818
00:56:43.943 --> 00:56:44.944 line:80%
Thank you.

819
00:56:49.532 --> 00:56:50.866 line:80%
Shall I take you home?

820
00:56:51.367 --> 00:56:52.660 line:80%
What?

821
00:56:52.743 --> 00:56:54.495 line:80%
It's just so late.

822
00:56:55.704 --> 00:56:57.498 line:80%
No, it's fine.

823
00:56:57.581 --> 00:56:59.542 line:80%
The buses are still running.

824
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:01.669 line:80%
I want to take you home.

825
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:09.635 line:80%
I'll decline.

826
00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:14.140 line:80%
I have plans with my boyfriend.

827
00:57:17.101 --> 00:57:18.185 line:80%
Bye.

828
00:57:34.535 --> 00:57:36.537 line:80%
Thank you. Keep the change.

829
00:57:39.915 --> 00:57:40.916 line:80%
What is it?

830
00:57:42.501 --> 00:57:45.713 line:80%
I was working late. I'm heading home now.

831
00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:48.549 line:80%
She'll drop work and run home for me?

832
00:57:49.508 --> 00:57:52.511 line:80%
Well, she's human too.
She must be hungry for it.

833
00:57:52.595 --> 00:57:55.556 line:80%
I have beer in the fridge.
Have some while waiting.

834
00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:57.892 line:80%
She's so excited!

835
00:57:59.602 --> 00:58:01.478 line:80%
Kang Ji-won. You're dead today.

836
00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:09.195 line:80%
This will get you wasted, right?

837
00:58:14.617 --> 00:58:16.368 line:80%
I love you, my other half.

838
00:58:16.452 --> 00:58:17.912 line:80%
Be nicer to me.

839
00:58:17.995 --> 00:58:19.914 line:80%
I love you! I said, I love you!

840
00:58:32.134 --> 00:58:33.135 line:80%
"Hurry over"?

841
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.805 line:80%
She didn't use any emojis. So cold.

842
00:58:37.306 --> 00:58:38.933 line:80%
She's being so mean.

843
00:58:40.226 --> 00:58:41.769 line:80%
I'm not going.

844
00:58:41.852 --> 00:58:42.853 line:80%
I'm not going!

845
00:58:56.242 --> 00:59:01.789 line:80%
You make my heart flutter and sink

846
00:59:07.628 --> 00:59:09.088 line:80%
Ji-won, you're so dead.

847
00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:11.382 line:80%
Why did he get here so fast?

848
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.853 line:80%
I'm not going. I'm mad. I'm going home!

849
00:59:24.937 --> 00:59:26.272 line:80%
I'm a little upset.

850
00:59:26.355 --> 00:59:28.023 line:80%
What? Why won't she come?

851
00:59:35.406 --> 00:59:36.407 line:80%
Hey, babe.

852
00:59:42.538 --> 00:59:43.956 line:80%
You got here fast!

853
00:59:44.039 --> 00:59:46.083 line:80%
I thought it'd take you longer.

854
00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:48.919 line:80%
I couldn't wait to spend
the night with you,

855
00:59:50.546 --> 00:59:51.630 line:80%
so I took a taxi.

856
00:59:53.424 --> 00:59:54.550 line:80%
You didn't have to.

857
00:59:56.969 --> 00:59:58.512 line:80%
It's been...

858
01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:02.141 line:80%
so long

859
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:04.310 line:80%
for us.

860
01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:05.853 line:80%
Hasn't it?

861
01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:08.939 line:80%
Yeah, it really has.

862
01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:11.942 line:80%
So I was thinking we should talk first...

863
01:00:14.028 --> 01:00:15.237 line:80%
Let's talk

864
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:16.280 line:80%
with our bodies.

865
01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.286 line:80%
Let's put on the clothes--

866
01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:26.915 line:80%
We don't

867
01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:28.792 line:80%
need

868
01:00:28.876 --> 01:00:30.127 line:80%
any clothes

869
01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:33.714 line:80%
right now!

870
01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:43.974 line:80%
All right.

871
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.310 line:80%
Don't move.

872
01:01:10.084 --> 01:01:11.627 line:80%
It looks so great on you!

873
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.630 line:80%
Turning a shameful past into history,

874
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:17.841 line:80%
can't be done overnight
for someone like me.

875
01:01:18.384 --> 01:01:20.511 line:80%
Actually, I've been bullied.

876
01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:23.847 line:80%
She forgets what a loser she is.

877
01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.518 line:80%
I'm so glad I met you, Mr. Park.

878
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.853 line:80%
I'm here. I'm behind you.

879
01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:32.981 line:80%
I had a crush on you!

880
01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:34.233 line:80%
There's someone I like.

881
01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:37.528 line:80%
Who is this woman he's fallen for?

882
01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:39.113 line:80%
Look into it.

883
01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:45.327 line:80%
