just sort of fuck off joking.

43
00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:09.041 line:80%
Well, I can't say I quite
get the "joke" myself,

44
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:12.875 line:80%
and this isn't the first time we've
had to talk about your "soft skills."

Would it be okay
if I went a bit off-piste?

52
00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:34.833 line:80%
I always find improv helps me

Uh, yeah. Sure.

54
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:44.375 line:80%
It's not hard...
it's impossible, Jennifer.

55
00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:48.500 line:80%
Impossible to be in a body
that won't give you what you want.

56
00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:54.041 line:80%
No. Don't, Jennifer. Please.

Don't you do that, Jen.

59
00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:04.291 line:80%
This isn't about you.
I want you so much, but my body--

Sorry, I think--Marlon?
Maybe just one on... script?

you as the intense guy who's seen horrors.

72
00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:44.083 line:80%
I'm an actor, I can be anything.

-West End venue.

-Is this standing about with a sign?
-In the West End.

79
00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:04.916 line:80%
I really think
you can bring something to this.

80
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.250 line:80%
Only thing is, they need someone
to commit for the whole season.

You'll have to get something.

See that was funny
because they weren't trying to be funny.

91
00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.416 line:80%
They just committed to their characters
and rolled with it.

-Um, yup. Trish and Dave, you're up.

-Oh. Well, lucky for you, I'm a doctor.
-No, you're not. You're a plumber.

97
00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:14.250 line:80%
[Trish] A plum--No.

98
00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:17.166 line:80%
-No, I'm a doctor. I do doctoring--
-Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.

100
00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:22.458 line:80%
If she says she's a doctor,
she's a doctor. Right?

101
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:27.083 line:80%
"Yes, and"? "Yes, and" always "yes, and,"
and then build on it.

102
00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:29.000 line:80%
Never hang your partner out to dry.

103
00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:32.875 line:80%
See, improv is all about
being in the moment,

104
00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.291 line:80%
even if the moment is completely insane.

105
00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:41.208 line:80%
Because when you're on that stage,
there are no mistakes...

106
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:43.750 line:80%
-Only opportunity.
-[glass bottle topples]

-Yeah. Come on.
-Okay. Um...

114

-And when in doubt, "yes, and."
-[all] "And."

116
00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:10.958 line:80%
Yes.

117
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:12.833 line:80%
"And."

118
00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:15.208 line:80%
Oh, I was just saying "yes,"

119
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:18.666 line:80%
but yes. And.

120
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.666 line:80%
Yeah. You can just wait
till the scene starts.

121
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.875 line:80%

Uh, sorry I'm late.

125
00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:36.166 line:80%
I was just remembering
what happened over there.

126
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.250 line:80%
Carnage.

127
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.666 line:80%
So where's my boy?

128
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.000 line:80%
Don't overthink it.

129
00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:43.125 line:80%
Uh, crikey...

130
00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:44.416 line:80%
Where's little Timmy?

131
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.500 line:80%
-First thing that pops into your head.
-I...really have no clue.

132
00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:50.041 line:80%
You lost my son?

-Mm-hmm.

136
00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:02.333 line:80%
Hey, Kat. Did you get that
my war vet was anti-vax?

137
00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:05.291 line:80%
Yeah.

138
00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:06.375 line:80%
Good.

139
00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:10.291 line:80%
Signed up to the rest
of the class, and...

140
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:16.125 line:80%
sorry, just trying to improvise
something around the word "class."

141
00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:17.333 line:80%
I wouldn't force it.

142
00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:20.250 line:80%
Right, right. Just relax. Oh, my--Christ!

143
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.625 line:80%
-I'm so sorry.
-Uh, no, it's fine. Leave it.

144
00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:24.125 line:80%
-Are you sure? Okay. Thank you.
-Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.

145
00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:26.000 line:80%
-No problem. I'll see you next week.
-Okay.

146
00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:29.875 line:80%
Hey, Kat. Could we have some advice?

147
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.333 line:80%
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

148
00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:33.750 line:80%
'Cause we've got some agents
coming to the showcase next week.

149
00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:37.833 line:80%
What? Wow, that was fast.

150
00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:40.916 line:80%
So, are there any questions we should ask?

151
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.291 line:80%
Oh. Well, um, see, you could ask,

152
00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:49.125 line:80%
are they looking for a 39-year-old redhead
with an expiring work visa?

153
00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:50.875 line:80%
No, no, no, no, no.

154
00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:56.000 line:80%
I would ask how they're gonna handle it
when the auditions dry up.

155
00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:58.750 line:80%
When you've been hustling for years
and years and years,

156
00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:03.250 line:80%
and you've got nothing to show for it
other than, uh, two lines

157
00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:05.791 line:80%
as "Sassy Barista" in a shitty sitcom.

158
00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.250 line:80%
I mean, that's the question, right?

159
00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:12.833 line:80%
Are they gonna stick around
when things get fucking dark?

160
00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:18.708 line:80%
Thanks, Kat.

161
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.791 line:80%
Yeah. Anytime.

162
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.583 line:80%
[police siren blaring]

163
00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:25.958 line:80%
[dramatic music playing]

164
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:27.500 line:80%
What the fuck?!

165
00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:30.708 line:80%
I mean, obviously,
life is hell at the moment.

166
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:34.208 line:80%
Since Paul and I sold the company,
we're stuck having sex again.

167
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.791 line:80%
-Hence this nightmare.
-[laughter]

168
00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:38.666 line:80%
As if having baby number four
wasn't enough,

169
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.375 line:80%
planning this one's hen-do
has been an absolute mindfuck.

170
00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:42.916 line:80%
God, nothing crazy, guys, please.

171
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.541 line:80%
Oh, no, don't worry. Super chill vibe,
budget's 500 each.

172
00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:47.666 line:80%
[chokes, coughs] Each?

173
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.125 line:80%
Yeah, but that covers literally everything
except food and drink.

174
00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:51.708 line:80%
Where are we going, Dubai?

175
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:52.750 line:80%
[laughter]

176
00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:54.500 line:80%
You are so funny, Kat.

177
00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:57.208 line:80%
Look, I'm not saying I'm getting married
just so we can see you again,

178
00:09:57.291 --> 00:10:00.291 line:80%
-but babes, it's been too long. Crazy.
-Way too long.

179
00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:03.333 line:80%
And you all look so perfect
and professional,

180
00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:06.375 line:80%
and just, um--and this place?

181
00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:08.250 line:80%
Remember our flat in Brixton?

182
00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:11.625 line:80%
[laughs] We were crazy.
I do kind of miss those days.

183
00:10:11.708 --> 00:10:13.250 line:80%
Oh, I don't. Perma hangover.

184
00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:15.375 line:80%
[groans] Greasy takeaway at 5:00 AM.

185
00:10:15.458 --> 00:10:17.583 line:80%
You know, I still order from Zing Palace.

186
00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:19.750 line:80%
Why?

187
00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:23.708 line:80%
Oh, are you joking? Okay.

188
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:25.625 line:80%
-Yeah.
-[laughter]

189
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:29.916 line:80%
Yeah. I mean, I do sometimes,
but, you know. [chuckles]

190
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.625 line:80%
How is it going with the comedy?

191
00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:38.000 line:80%
-Someone said that you're teaching?
-You're a teacher?

192
00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:39.208 line:80%
-Oh, so good to give back.
-Oh, no, no, no.

193
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:41.583 line:80%
I'm not like, um, a teacher-teacher.

194
00:10:41.666 --> 00:10:43.833 line:80%
I'm just doing it for right now, you know?

195
00:10:43.916 --> 00:10:46.166 line:80%
You know, if you need money,
we can always lend you.

196
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.416 line:80%
-Oh, yes!
-Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine, I'm fine.

197
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.541 line:80%
I'm gonna be rewriting my solo show.

198
00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:54.666 line:80%
And, you know,
if I get it produced, that is...

199
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.041 line:80%
Babes... you're obviously crazy talented,

200
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:04.625 line:80%
but it feels like it's been 10 years
of rewriting this solo show

201
00:11:04.708 --> 00:11:10.708 line:80%
and we're just worried that the world
is never gonna see what we see.

202
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.083 line:80%
Right.

203
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:20.916 line:80%
Well, what I see is empty glasses!

204
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000 line:80%
[dramatic music playing]

205
00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:28.458 line:80%
[phone vibrates]

206
00:11:28.541 --> 00:11:29.791 line:80%
Terry?

207
00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:33.041 line:80%
So the Boner Pill guys tell me
you went full Daniel Day-Lewis.

208
00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:34.416 line:80%
Did they like it?

209
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.458 line:80%
[Terry]
Marlon, this actor
you're trying to be,

210
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:38.208 line:80%
sorry, but you don't have it in you.

211
00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:40.166 line:80%
I think maybe it's time we parted ways.

212
00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:48.708 line:80%
Fuck... this.

213
00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:51.958 line:80%
Hugo... [clears throat]

214
00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:54.166 line:80%
-Oh, Sam, it's Hugh.
-[Sam] A quick one, yeah?

215
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.666 line:80%
Uh, I'm just heading out for a pint
and I wondered if you're free.

216
00:11:57.666 --> 00:12:00.583 line:80%
Who, me? Yeah, I got--
sure, yeah, of course.

217
00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:02.250 line:80%
Oh, sweet. Would you mind
popping over to my desk

218
00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:04.041 line:80%
and sorting out the tangled wires
and shit?

219
00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:06.083 line:80%
Cheers, mate. Thanks.

220
00:12:06.166 --> 00:12:09.166 line:80%
[dramatic music playing]

221
00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:16.666 line:80%
[man]
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kat Boyles
.

222
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.583 line:80%
[cheering and applause]

223
00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:21.416 line:80%
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much, everyone.

224
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.041 line:80%
Again, I'm Kat. I coach improv here,

225
00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:25.750 line:80%
which you can tell from how well
I moved that chair.

226
00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:27.000 line:80%
[laughter]

227
00:12:27.083 --> 00:12:29.875 line:80%
These guys have worked so hard
over the last two weeks

228
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.291 line:80%
and they are ready to rock,
so shall we get them in?

229
00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:36.083 line:80%
-[man] Yeah!
-[Kat] Come on in, everyone! [laughs]

230
00:12:36.166 --> 00:12:37.666 line:80%
[applause]

231
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.375 line:80%
-[laughs]
-[woman] Isn't it?

232
00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:42.625 line:80%
[man] Hey.

233
00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:46.333 line:80%
Done a great job with this lot.

234
00:12:48.666 --> 00:12:50.916 line:80%
-Thanks.
-Listen, uh... [clears throat]

235
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.208 line:80%
I don't know what your availabilities are,

236
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:56.750 line:80%
but, um, I'm looking to work
with someone just like you.

237
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.250 line:80%
Oh. Are you like an agent, producer, or...

238
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:05.958 line:80%
Detective Sergeant.

239
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.458 line:80%
It's a program the Met
have been running for the last year.

240
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:15.791 line:80%
Using improvisers for low-level stings
to bust counterfeiters,

241
00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:18.958 line:80%
unlicensed bookies,
you know, that kind of thing.

242
00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:22.625 line:80%
-Why improvisers?
-Crooks spot the police a mile off,

243
00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:25.916 line:80%
plus, we're not so good at thinking
on our feet. But you are.

244
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:29.916 line:80%
In fact, I've been watching you
for a while now,

245
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.083 line:80%
and I can see you're one of the best.

246
00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:33.833 line:80%
[laughs]

247
00:13:33.916 --> 00:13:36.958 line:80%
You'd have backup,
so it's negligible risk.

248
00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:38.833 line:80%
So is this like a volunteer thing?

249
00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:42.208 line:80%
Two hundred quid a pop. Each.

250
00:13:42.291 --> 00:13:43.375 line:80%
Each?

251
00:13:43.458 --> 00:13:47.000 line:80%
Operatives work in threes.
Your call who to bring in.

252
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.333 line:80%
Think it over.

253
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.166 line:80%
[audience laughs]

254
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.833 line:80%
[Hugh] Well, this is the craziest safari
I've ever been on!

255
00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:01.750 line:80%
Is this ride definitely safe?

256
00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.666 line:80%
[makes sound]
Have no complaints. Just funerals.

257
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.916 line:80%
[audience laughs]

258
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.666 line:80%
Hey. So, I've got exciting news.

259
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.083 line:80%
We know. Never thought it would happen
literally on the night.

260
00:14:12.166 --> 00:14:14.583 line:80%
-What? What happened?
-[Laura] We got signed!

261
00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:16.291 line:80%
That's what you meant, right?

262
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.083 line:80%
Yes. Yeah!

263
00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:23.875 line:80%
-She's taking us to Soho House!
-[Laura] Thank you for everything, Kat.

264
00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.750 line:80%
-You are an amazing teacher.
-[Siena] You're the best.

265
00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:27.791 line:80%
[laughs]

266
00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:30.000 line:80%
[sighs]

267
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000 line:80%
[quirky music playing]

268
00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:48.750 line:80%
Okay. So here's the deal.

269
00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:52.541 line:80%
Two hundred each,
and we'd be doing a public service.

270
00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:56.125 line:80%
I dunno. I got into improv to help
my character work, not the cops.

271
00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:57.750 line:80%
This is character work.

272
00:14:57.833 --> 00:14:58.833 line:80%
Well, I suppose...

273
00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:02.041 line:80%
we're sort of going undercover.

274
00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:04.458 line:80%
Well, we just go and buy something.

275
00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:06.250 line:80%
I could write a whole backstory.

276
00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:07.541 line:80%
[Kat] You could.

277
00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:09.125 line:80%
"Who is this guy?

278
00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:13.333 line:80%
Why is he buying fake handbags,
what does he know?"

279
00:15:13.416 --> 00:15:17.041 line:80%
Uh-huh. Hugh? You in?

280
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.375 line:80%
Oh, gosh. Police.

281
00:15:19.458 --> 00:15:22.458 line:80%
Gets your blood pumping
just saying the word, doesn't it?

282
00:15:22.541 --> 00:15:25.333 line:80%
I don't know, it might be tricky
getting time off work.

283
00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:28.458 line:80%
Dude. Can you imagine the stories
you can tell at work

284
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:31.166 line:80%
once you've done stings for the police?

285
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.958 line:80%
What are we thinking for costume?

286
00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:39.041 line:80%
[dramatic music playing]

287
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:55.125 line:80%
The fuck's that on your face?

288
00:15:55.208 --> 00:15:58.083 line:80%
Too much? Fine, I can take notes.

289
00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.875 line:80%
Right, super simple.

290
00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:04.125 line:80%
There's been a citywide uptick in the sale
of counterfeit cigarettes.

291
00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:09.041 line:80%
Chock-full of all sorts of cheap nasties.
Health crisis in the making.

292
00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:13.708 line:80%
We've got intel the shop
down the road is in on it.

293
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:17.708 line:80%
Pay them a visit, ask
for "something more affordable,"

294
00:16:17.791 --> 00:16:21.125 line:80%
that's the code-phrase,
then buy a brick and leave.

295
00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:23.208 line:80%
So we each buy one? Or...

296
00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:27.708 line:80%
Oh, I forgot you're virgins.
Point. Wing. Nest.

297
00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:29.125 line:80%
Point makes the order.

298
00:16:29.208 --> 00:16:31.541 line:80%
Wing browses nearby, there if needed.

299
00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:34.166 line:80%
Nest is in the doorway, on lookout.

300
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.666 line:80%
Here. Take this.

301
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.875 line:80%
Call me before entry
so I can get them on tape.

302
00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.333 line:80%
Don't we need a wire?

303
00:16:41.416 --> 00:16:43.791 line:80%
You'll get them later with the snipers
and proximity mines.

304
00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:46.875 line:80%
Fucking hell. Go on, fuck off.

305
00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:47.958 line:80%
[Kat sighs]

306
00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:53.250 line:80%
Okay. So this is just another
round of improv, yes?

307
00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:55.541 line:80%
So remember the fundamentals. "Yes, and."

308
00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:57.166 line:80%

00:26:21.708 --> 00:26:24.083 line:80%
All right, 50's fair.

He ain't gonna raise.

474
00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:29.375 line:80%

'Cause like what is life?

481
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:49.166 line:80%
Is time really linear, or in a way,
we're just living through everything

482
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.375 line:80%
that ever happened all at the same time?

[Billings] All you had to do
was buy the cigarettes.

504
00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:24.041 line:80%
But no, you come back bleeding, coked up,
and covered in sick.

505
00:28:24.125 --> 00:28:25.791 line:80%
Fly could have killed you.

506
00:28:25.875 --> 00:28:27.416 line:80%
I'm really sorry.

507
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:31.625 line:80%
But he didn't.

508
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.750 line:80%
You have to go back in.

509
00:28:36.833 --> 00:28:37.875 line:80%
What?

510
00:28:37.958 --> 00:28:40.291 line:80%
You could infiltrate his crew.

511
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:42.708 line:80%
Fly moves 10 mil a year.

512
00:28:42.791 --> 00:28:46.958 line:80%
If you get tabs on his next deal,
my God,

513
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:48.625 line:80%
that'll be huge for the Met.

-I mean, we were pretty damn good.

516
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.666 line:80%
Marlon, no fucking way.
This is getting completely out of control.

517
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.250 line:80%
Okay. Okay. Forget the police.

518
00:28:59.333 --> 00:29:00.708 line:80%
This could be huge for you.

You'd be heroes.

522

How many rejections have you faced?

523
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.791 line:80%
How many times have you been made

Penetrating Fly's gang takes you
well beyond the remit of this program.

529
00:29:50.416 --> 00:29:52.333 line:80%
You're going deep cover.

530
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:54.000 line:80%
To all intents and purposes,

531
00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:56.541 line:80%
you are Bonnie,

532
00:29:56.625 --> 00:29:59.250 line:80%
Roach, and The Squire.

533

The only person who knows
your real identities is me.

534
00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:06.666 line:80%
Now, the rules of undercover policing
are simple.

535
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.875 line:80%
Never break character. Say yes.

536
00:30:08.958 --> 00:30:11.500 line:80%
And always, always trust your partner.

537
00:30:11.583 --> 00:30:15.208 line:80%
Remember, we need info
on Fly's next supply deal.

538
00:30:17.583 --> 00:30:18.916 line:80%
I need to frisk ya.

'Cause I need a man?

547

No. God, no.
You are a fantastic, strong, uh, bull.

548
00:30:57.375 --> 00:31:01.875 line:80%
No, I just meant, uh, a lady in need
of a--of a bigger challenge.

549
00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:03.250 line:80%
That's what I...

Yeah. We're gonna close up shop

Lay low.

556

Well, there's nothing really doing
right now.

557
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:22.791 line:80%
But...

558
00:31:24.458 --> 00:31:28.208 line:80%
this prick owes me 20 grand.

559
00:31:28.291 --> 00:31:30.625 line:80%
I want you to go and shake him down.

560

Oh, Pinot noir, lovely drop.

Yeah, it's smooth,
with a chocolate finish.

562
00:31:37.958 --> 00:31:40.083 line:80%
You're strange.

563
00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.875 line:80%
But also polite.

564
00:31:41.958 --> 00:31:43.291 line:80%
And well dressed.

565
00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:45.541 line:80%

Yeah. Uh, so we're going.

570
00:31:52.916 --> 00:31:57.041 line:80%
Um, for what it's worth,
you're quite strange, too.

571
00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:01.125 line:80%
So, we don't actually do this?

572
00:32:01.208 --> 00:32:02.333 line:80%
[Billings]
Of course, you do.

573
00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:05.541 line:80%
Pass the test, go deeper,
gain Fly's trust.

574
00:32:05.625 --> 00:32:07.708 line:80%
I really don't like the sound of it,
what if he's got a gun?

575
00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:09.583 line:80%
Mm. Maybe we should go in strapped.

576
00:32:09.666 --> 00:32:11.583 line:80%
"Strapped," Marlon?
What are you talking about?

577
00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:14.375 line:80%
It's what Roach would say.
Please don't pull me out of character.

578
00:32:14.458 --> 00:32:17.125 line:80%
Listen, this bozo's not gonna fuck
with Fly.

579
00:32:17.208 --> 00:32:20.250 line:80%
And I'm on standby in case
it goes south, but it won't.

580
00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:22.375 line:80%
Worst case, we've got The Squire.

581
00:32:22.458 --> 00:32:23.916 line:80%
That doesn't even mean anything.

582
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.833 line:80%
[Billings]
You're gonna be fine.
Low risk, high reward.

583
00:32:26.916 --> 00:32:29.000 line:80%
Now, shut the fuck up and go.

[Hugh]
What if he doesn't pay?

585
00:32:31.666 --> 00:32:34.833 line:80%
I'll make him. This fuck's crossed me
too many times.

586
00:32:34.916 --> 00:32:36.458 line:80%
Do you know him?
Is he violent?

587
00:32:36.541 --> 00:32:38.125 line:80%
Just ignore him.
He's being method.

588
00:32:38.208 --> 00:32:40.541 line:80%
I'm sorry. What happened
to "commit to your character"?

589
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:43.208 line:80%
If things go sideways,
just throw in a grenade.

590
00:32:43.291 --> 00:32:45.041 line:80%
-A grenade?
-A curveball.

591
00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:46.541 line:80%
Something he won't see coming.

-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, listen, listen.

593
00:32:48.875 --> 00:32:51.875 line:80%
But most important is trust
your gut, remember?

594
00:32:51.958 --> 00:32:53.250 line:80%
Mm-hmm.

595
00:32:53.333 --> 00:32:54.666 line:80%
Right.

596
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.583 line:80%
Time to get revenge
for what happened in Milan.

597
00:33:00.041 --> 00:33:01.416 line:80%
It's this way.

598
00:33:03.208 --> 00:33:07.750 line:80%
