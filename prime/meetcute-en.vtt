the business out of the way,

164

you know, and get to pleasure.

165
00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:30.951 line:80%

179
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:48.677 line:80%
I mean, I kind of figured,

180
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.596 line:80%
-but...
-No, I am.

181
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:52.306 line:80%
I am, actually, very much.
I wouldn't lie about that.

182
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.099 line:80%
But I'm just not from very far
in the future.

183
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.976 line:80%

-I work from home.
-Oh.

208
00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:35.224 line:80%
So, the lonely boy

209
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.062 line:80%
Well, when you say it like that,
I kind of sound sad.

210

No! You're not sad.

211
00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:43.857 line:80%

212
00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.235 line:80%

-Hmm.
-[Sheila] I feel lonelier

in an open-floor plan
from 9:00 to 5:00

218
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.829 line:80%
than I would at the bottom
of a fucking well.

219
00:08:57.955 --> 00:08:59.957 line:80%
Huh. Bottom of a well
can be pretty fucking lonely.

220
00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:01.750 line:80%
-[Sheila] Thank you.
-So, about that... Thank you.

229
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.598 line:80%

231
00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:20.185 line:80%
I mean, it's a total
maintenance nightmare.

232
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.770 line:80%
And they chip all the time.
You know what I'm saying?

233
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.523 line:80%
-[Gary] Mm.
-But I was having the best day.

234
00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:27.025 line:80%
I was walking on 23rd,and I saw this nail salon.

235
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.902 line:80%
It was called, "Nail Me Good."

236
00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:31.321 line:80%
And I just felt it deservedmy money.

237
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.073 line:80%
I was greetedwith the international welcome

238
00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.741 line:80%
of nail salons worldwide.

239
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.660 line:80%
What color?

240
00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.288 line:80%
Hmm. Maybe something that says,
"I've had a really nice day."

241
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:43.292 line:80%
Ooh, Elegant Day! Perfect.

242
00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:44.835 line:80%
So, I get my nails done.

243
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.962 line:80%
And then I have to usethe bathroom.

244
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.588 line:80%
Do you have a restroom here?
I just need to freshen up.

245
00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.634 line:80%
And there in the backwas a large horizontal glowing

246
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.012 line:80%
neon bed that lookedlike a tanning machine.

247
00:09:55.137 --> 00:09:57.014 line:80%
And I was like, "Fuck it.I'm having a great day.

248
00:09:57.139 --> 00:09:58.640 line:80%
I should get a fucking tan".

249
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.392 line:80%

00:10:02.978 --> 00:10:04.479 line:80%
June.

253
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:05.814 line:80%
So, how much to use
the tanning machine?

254
00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.190 line:80%
Oh, no. It's not a tan machine.

255
00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:08.942 line:80%
-It's a time machine.
-Aw.

256
00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.736 line:80%
Yeah. The owner bought it.

257
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:11.820 line:80%
But he doesn't like it.
It only goes back 24 hours.

258
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.447 line:80%
Mm. Damn false advertising.

259
00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:15.032 line:80%
It's such a problem these days,
June.

260
00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:16.450 line:80%
Tell me about it.

261
00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:17.993 line:80%
The owner went back 24 hours
before he bought

262
00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.453 line:80%
the time machine
to not buy the time machine.

263
00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:22.164 line:80%
So, if he... he did that,

264
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:25.000 line:80%
then why is the time machine
still here?

265
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.174 line:80%
-Anyway, you wanna try it?
-Me?

266
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:35.719 line:80%
[chuckles] No, no.
I don't think so.

267
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.471 line:80%
Plus, you know,
I have a sensitive stomach.

268
00:10:37.596 --> 00:10:39.723 line:80%
Try it. It's fun.

269
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.558 line:80%
Okay. Fuck it. I will.

270
00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.852 line:80%

277
00:10:55.197 --> 00:10:56.865 line:80%
Oh my God.
I didn't even think about that.

278

about that!

279

I don't know. I just...

314
00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.822 line:80%
I haven't done this
in a long time.

315
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:19.823 line:80%
I guess I'm awkwardly trying
to say I'm having a good time.

316
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:21.283 line:80%
[chuckles]

317
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.910 line:80%
-So, uh, yeah.
-No, no. I get it.

318
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.704 line:80%
Besides,
there's not guesswork here.

319
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:28.540 line:80%
Lucky for you, my mouth speaks
before my brain tells it to.

320
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.208 line:80%
Oh, I know. I like that.

321
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.127 line:80%
Yeah. Well, that...

322
00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.463 line:80%
You like it now,
but you will not like it later.

323
00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:36.256 line:80%
-[chuckles]
-Mm. I doubt that very much.

324
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.475 line:80%
We're almost there.

325
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.310 line:80%
-Where?
-Dessert!

326
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.311 line:80%
Dessert?

327
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:54.483 line:80%
[♪♪]

328
00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:57.110 line:80%
Oh, that looks good.

329
00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.236 line:80%
-Whoa!
-Whoops! Sorry.

330
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.113 line:80%
-[chuckles]
-[Gary] Hi.

331
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.865 line:80%
Beautiful night.

332
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.575 line:80%
Yes. It is.

333
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.286 line:80%
Um, what do you recommend?

334
00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.872 line:80%
[Chai] We got a flavor
called "Childhood".

335
00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.958 line:80%
It's, uh, ice cream made
out of milk left to soak

336
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.461 line:80%
for two weeks
in Fruity Pebbles cereal

337
00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.838 line:80%
served on a cone made
out of deconstructed

338
00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.632 line:80%
peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches.

339
00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:23.845 line:80%
Um, do you have vanilla?

340
00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:25.847 line:80%
No.

341
00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:27.849 line:80%
[chuckles softly]

342
00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.312 line:80%
[Gary]
You know, it...

343
00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:33.730 line:80%
it really does taste
like my childhood.

344
00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:35.398 line:80%
I know. Mine, too. It's amazing.

345
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.071 line:80%
-[laughs]
-What?

346
00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.614 line:80%
You're just like a little baby.

347
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:43.865 line:80%
-What?
-It's all over your face.

348
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.243 line:80%
-Shut up!
-[chuckles]

349
00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:47.619 line:80%
I grew up
in that apartment building

350
00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.079 line:80%
-right there.
-What?

351
00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:50.080 line:80%
-Literally right there.
-Right there?

352
00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.122 line:80%
-Uh-huh.
-No way!

353
00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:53.166 line:80%
Yep! 600, apartment 1K.

354
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.126 line:80%
That's crazy.
What was that like?

355
00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:57.379 line:80%
Um, the city
was kinda different.

356
00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:59.130 line:80%
It was... it was fine.

357
00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:01.049 line:80%
But... well, it was a little bit
lonely, you know?

358
00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:06.763 line:80%
I'm having a very strange
feeling,

359
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:09.182 line:80%
like a memory right now.

360
00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.894 line:80%
This cable guy showed up
at our house.

361
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:16.064 line:80%
I was really little,
but I don't totally remember,

362
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.983 line:80%
but...

363
00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.652 line:80%
I do remember
he was so nice to me.

364
00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:27.409 line:80%
-Is that so weird?
-Yes.

365
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:28.493 line:80%
-Yeah?
-That’s very weird.

366
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.161 line:80%
[chuckles]

367
00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:33.582 line:80%
I was normal. I had friends.

368
00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.500 line:80%
I didn't, like,
murder animals or anything.

369
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.335 line:80%
Okay. Well, that fact that
you just had to clarify that

370
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.670 line:80%
means you're fucked up.

371
00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.880 line:80%
[laughs]

372
00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.049 line:80%
[chuckles]

373
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:44.968 line:80%
So, should we keep
this adventure up?

374
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.429 line:80%
-Should we go somewhere else?
-I'd love to.

375
00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.055 line:80%
-Do you like polka music?
-No!

376
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.098 line:80%
-What?
-Do you?

377
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.933 line:80%
-Yes!
-Ew!

378
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.185 line:80%
You know, I can't tell
which one I like more.

379
00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:55.729 line:80%
The hoppy one or the wheaty.

380
00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.230 line:80%
Well, you're just
gonna have to keep

381
00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:58.273 line:80%
drinking them,
so you can find out.

382
00:14:58.398 --> 00:14:59.482 line:80%
Right. For science.

383
00:14:59.608 --> 00:15:00.984 line:80%
Obviously, for science, yes.

384
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:01.818 line:80%
That's what we're doing,
an experiment.

385
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.281 line:80%
[Gary]
Oh, absolutely.

386
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.282 line:80%
[Sheila]
You know, Gary, I just...

387
00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:08.908 line:80%
I...

388
00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:10.493 line:80%
I gotta come clean with you
about something.

389
00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:11.995 line:80%
I know, I know.

390
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.163 line:80%
You're from the future.
I... I get it.

391
00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.498 line:80%
-Yes. Yes, I am.
-Mm.

392
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:17.083 line:80%
But um, something else.

393
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:18.835 line:80%
Remember earlier
at the restaurant

394
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.004 line:80%
when you asked me what I did
with my other self

395
00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.048 line:80%
when I traveled back
to her timeline?

396
00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.549 line:80%
And I was like...
[chuckles mockingly]

397
00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:25.884 line:80%
"I didn't even think
about that."

398
00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.135 line:80%
-[chuckles mockingly]
-Mm.

399
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.303 line:80%
-Do you remember?
-Mmhmm.

400
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:29.888 line:80%
-That was a lie.
-Okay.

401
00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:35.852 line:80%
-I killed her.
-[chokes, coughs]

402
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.896 line:80%
I wasn't expecting that.
You killed her?

403
00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.606 line:80%
-I did, yeah.
-Okay.

404
00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:40.649 line:80%
My car just, like...
[imitates car sound]

405
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:41.983 line:80%
...right over her face.

406
00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.485 line:80%
-That... that will do it.
-Yeah.

407
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.028 line:80%
And then I stuffed her
in my trunk.

408
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:48.907 line:80%
-Oh. Um, congrats on that.
-Thank you.

409
00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.033 line:80%
Yeah. You're a murderer.

410
00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.409 line:80%
[chuckles]

411
00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.620 line:80%
So, here's to, uh, dead Sheila.

412
00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.955 line:80%
-Yes! Yes.
-I hope she's in a better place.

413
00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:57.749 line:80%
-Yes, absolutely.
-Absolutely.

414
00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.334 line:80%
I mean, I'm jealous of her
to be honest with you.

415
00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.169 line:80%
Absolutely.
I mean, the world is a...

416
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.421 line:80%
-[crowd gasps]
-Oh! What the fuck?

417
00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.632 line:80%
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
Fuck, I'm so sorry.

418
00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:07.217 line:80%
-It's fine.
-[Gary] I'm sorry. I'm...

419
00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:08.885 line:80%
What are you doing?

420
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.388 line:80%
-Fuck.
-Are you kidding me? Look.

421
00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.391 line:80%
It's okay for things to be
messy sometimes, okay?

422
00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.394 line:80%
-It is?
-Yeah.

423
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.230 line:80%
Uh...

424
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:21.564 line:80%
you still wanna stay
on the date?

425
00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:27.028 line:80%
[kisses, chuckles]

426
00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:33.326 line:80%
[♪♪]

427
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.207 line:80%
-[laughs]
-[Gary] It was like so...

428
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.208 line:80%
[indistinct speech]

429
00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:42.377 line:80%
It's true!

430
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.505 line:80%
[both shriek]

431
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:51.511 line:80%
[yelps]

432
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.140 line:80%
[chuckles]

433
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.487 line:80%
[Gary] I really like that
sentence you said before.

434
00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.115 line:80%
The, uh, the one about things
being messy.

435
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.366 line:80%
Yeah! Me, too.

436
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.784 line:80%
Someone said that to me
a long time ago,

437
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.786 line:80%
and it really stuck.

438
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.164 line:80%
Like it released me from some
sort of mental prison, you know?

439
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.583 line:80%
Yeah. Exactly.
That's exactly how it feels.

440
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.418 line:80%
Yeah.

441
00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.503 line:80%
-What a night.
-Yeah.

442
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.380 line:80%
Was it, uh, worth
all the time travel?

443
00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:28.590 line:80%
Oh, absolutely.

444
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:29.716 line:80%
Nine stars on Yelp.

445
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.760 line:80%
[chuckles]

446
00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.179 line:80%
You know, I could probably
do this forever.

447
00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:37.974 line:80%
But it is getting a little late,
so...

448
00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.434 line:80%
I'd really love to do this
again sometime.

449
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.518 line:80%
Me, too.

450
00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:41.519 line:80%
I'll see you tomorrow.

451
00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.146 line:80%
What?

452
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.106 line:80%
You know, when I travel back
24 hours again.

453
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.193 line:80%
[scoffs] What...
what do you mean again?

454
00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:49.694 line:80%
Oh. Ah.

455
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.237 line:80%
I gotta come clean with you,
Gary.

456
00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:52.739 line:80%
This not our first rodeo.
[chuckles]

457
00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:54.491 line:80%
-What are you talking about?
-Yeah.

458
00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:55.992 line:80%
I've spent the entire week
with you.

459
00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.452 line:80%
This night,
seven times in a row.

460
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.372 line:80%
Okay, wait.
So... so, you weren't kidding?

461
00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.750 line:80%
No, not kidding.
Very serious.

462
00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.920 line:80%
Okay.

463
00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.588 line:80%
Let's just pretend for a second
that I believe your whole

464
00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.298 line:80%
future time-travel bullshit.

465
00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.050 line:80%
Because I... I don't,
because it's bonkers.

466
00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:13.343 line:80%
But let's just pretend
that I do.

467
00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.094 line:80%
-Okay.
-Why would you travel back

468
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.680 line:80%
to the same time
over and over again? Why?

469
00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.766 line:80%
So, you could get it right,
or just to try and like,

470
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.434 line:80%
-win me over, or like...
-[Sheila] No!

471
00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.311 line:80%
-What... what are you doing?
-No!

472
00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.271 line:80%
That would be super weird,
and creepy, and obsessive.

473
00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:27.273 line:80%
No. That's the whole point.
I don't have to be perfect.

474
00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:29.108 line:80%
All this magic you're feeling,
I felt it, too, from night one,

475
00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:30.944 line:80%
and every night after that.

476
00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:32.946 line:80%
And no matter which way
I came at you, awkward, funny,

477
00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:35.073 line:80%
silly, sad, you... you played it
off perfectly.

478
00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:37.408 line:80%
And by the end of the night,
we were always on cloud nine.

479
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.701 line:80%
That's the thing.
I don't have to try.

480
00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.245 line:80%
We just work.

481
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.246 line:80%
Have you ever had a night
like this

482
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.163 line:80%
ever in your entire life?

483
00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:45.667 line:80%
You haven't.

484
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.544 line:80%
See, because you feel
the magic, too.

485
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:50.421 line:80%
You feel it here,
and you feel it here,

486
00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.799 line:80%
-and you feel it here.
-Hey! All right, yes.

487
00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.551 line:80%
-Yes, I... I feel it there.
-Okay.

488
00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.344 line:80%
[chuckles]

489
00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.054 line:80%
That's why I have to keep
revisiting this night.

490
00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:59.264 line:80%
The perfect night.

491
00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:01.057 line:80%
But why would you wanna revisit

492
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.601 line:80%
the same thing
over and over again?

493
00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:05.311 line:80%
You know, wouldn’t you wanna try
something new?

494
00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:07.313 line:80%
And maybe, I don't know,
we go out for like

495
00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:10.233 line:80%
a second date or see
if we have a future

496
00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.901 line:80%
-like the old-fashioned way.
-No.

497
00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.069 line:80%
Gary, I've already done that,
okay?

498
00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:14.654 line:80%
It just... it doesn't end well.

499
00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.614 line:80%
Look. Tomorrow,
Amber's gonna call you,

500
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:18.324 line:80%
and tell you she's pregnant
or you're gonna get killed

501
00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:19.993 line:80%
in a freaky
subway track accident.

502
00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.412 line:80%
It was terrible.
Your body was, like, all...

503
00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:24.372 line:80%
It was everywhere
and very unsettling.

504
00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:25.832 line:80%
Or the entire East Coast
is gonna get nuked, you know?

505
00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.417 line:80%
And we think
it's North Koreans,

506
00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:28.835 line:80%
but realize
it's an inside job, so...

507
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.044 line:80%
What? What do you...

508
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.838 line:80%
Nothing. Gary, it's okay.

509
00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.798 line:80%
Listen, it doesn't matter.
This is just about us.

510
00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:36.676 line:80%
You have to trust me.
This is the cleaner way.

511
00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.054 line:80%
Um...

512
00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:42.932 line:80%
I'm, uh...

513
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.520 line:80%
I'm really tired.
Uh, my head hurts.

514
00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:50.481 line:80%
I think I should
probably get going.

515
00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:53.026 line:80%
I know.

516
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.402 line:80%
It was nice to meet you,
uh, Sheila.

517
00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.614 line:80%
Bye, Gary.

518
00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.449 line:80%

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.294 line:80%
I had coping mechanisms, too.
I mean, not the murdering part.

547
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.922 line:80%
Actually, yeah, I did.
More murdering myself.

548
00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:39.841 line:80%
I more have, like,
these impulses

549
00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.426 line:80%
that I can't control
where things just...

550
00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:46.639 line:80%
It's very hard to live that way.

551
00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.391 line:80%
Yeah. I imagine that could be
quite debilitating.

Let's go to this one.

I kind of wanted to do that
with you, but with burping.

563
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.501 line:80%
I don't know. You know,
a lot of people actually say

564
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.962 line:80%
I remind them

Hmm.

571
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:28.306 line:80%
Okay, since
you're from the future,

572
00:22:28.431 --> 00:22:29.766 line:80%
you can... you can tell

573
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:31.309 line:80%
-what I'm gonna say?
-What I'm gonna say.

574

-You know, because...
-Yeah.

577
00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:38.691 line:80%
So you can get business
out of the way,

578
00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:39.609 line:80%
so you can focus
on the pleasure.

each other for three months,

604
00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:39.627 line:80%
upon this time machine
on a very happy, sunshiney,

605
00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:41.796 line:80%
perfect day, but that's just
really not the case.

606
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:43.422 line:80%
See, on that fateful day,
three months ago

607
00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:45.174 line:80%
when I took my first trip,
I was actually

608
00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:46.801 line:80%

I plan on killing myself,

612
00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:59.188 line:80%
and I'd really like to go out
with some nice nails, you know?

613
00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:00.815 line:80%
For the fans.

614
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.816 line:80%
What?

615
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.735 line:80%
What color?

616
00:24:07.488 --> 00:24:10.992 line:80%
Mm, something more that says
she lived a classy life.

617

Hmm. Elegant Death. I like it.

618

-Great.

619
00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:21.878 line:80%
Do you have a bathroom here?

620
00:24:22.003 --> 00:24:24.505 line:80%
I'd really like to die
on an empty bladder.

621
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.883 line:80%
Yeah. I have a bathroom.

622
00:24:27.008 --> 00:24:30.011 line:80%
Maybe before you straight up
murder yourself, go in there.

623
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:35.808 line:80%
What? Time travel? Why?
Why would I do that?

624
00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:38.060 line:80%
Why would I wanna go back
to yesterday?

625

And those are rare.
So, maybe you should take it.

645

You might see things differently
on the other side.

647

I should not have said
any of that.

-What? [chuckles]
-Oh. I'm sorry.

714

I thought, uh...

715
00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:18.114 line:80%
For some reason,
I thought maybe you might

716
00:28:18.239 --> 00:28:19.365 line:80%
have mentioned.

Okay.

My entire childhood.
Yeah.

That's crazy.
What was that like?

Uh, you know, the city was...

723
00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:35.506 line:80%
was very different then,
but it was kinda lonely.

724

My mom kinda gave up
pretty early.

Um,

727
00:28:45.683 --> 00:28:49.437 line:80%
there was this, like, cable guy
who stopped by one afternoon.

728
00:28:49.562 --> 00:28:51.105 line:80%
I was very little,
so I don't really remember.

729
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.314 line:80%
But he was very nice to me.

why I just told you that.

740
00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:11.709 line:80%
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Well, I think...

741
00:29:11.834 --> 00:29:14.128 line:80%
It's not a big deal.
It's just my phone.

742
00:29:14.253 --> 00:29:15.921 line:80%
-I think I can fix it. I...
-Gary.

I've been saying Zag-at.

I don't think so.
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:08.349 line:80%
So, actually, this was the spot
I was gonna kill myself.

Can you believe it?

760

Wait.

761
00:30:13.062 --> 00:30:15.147 line:80%
-Really?
-I know. Think about it.

762
00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:18.025 line:80%
The... the drop, the dive,
the chill of the water.

763

I mean,

764
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:20.903 line:80%
it's a pretty...
pretty good way to go.

765
00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:22.446 line:80%
Plus, no blood.

766
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:23.906 line:80%
And no, like,
weird forensics like,

767
00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:26.116 line:80%
"What happened to her?"
It'd be very obvious.

768
00:30:26.242 --> 00:30:27.409 line:80%
Pretty selfless way
to kill yourself,

769
00:30:27.535 --> 00:30:29.370 line:80%
don't you think?

00:30:29.495 --> 00:30:31.705 line:80%
I feel like people would call me
"the Mother Teresa of suicides".

771

Maybe not.
But I don't mind if they do.

it's... deep down, it's...

774

it's all jokes, right?

Uh, no. Not all of them.

776
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:49.765 line:80%

777
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.600 line:80%
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

778
00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:53.978 line:80%
I've been waiting for you
my whole life, Gary.

779

Oh. Huh. Um, all right.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.129 line:80%
-You.
-Okay.

1092
00:43:09.254 --> 00:43:10.422 line:80%
Yeah.

1093
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:13.883 line:80%
It started as an accident.

1094
00:43:14.009 --> 00:43:16.720 line:80%
Then I fell in love with you.

1095
00:43:16.845 --> 00:43:19.639 line:80%
And I started spending
a lot of time with you,

1096
00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:22.225 line:80%
365 days to be exact.

1097
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.352 line:80%
I loved everything about you.

1098
00:43:24.477 --> 00:43:26.062 line:80%
Everything.

1099
00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:28.690 line:80%
Until I didn't.
I mean, I do. I did.

1100
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:30.400 line:80%
But I just wanted, you know...
I just needed to, like, change

1101
00:43:30.525 --> 00:43:31.943 line:80%
a couple things,
just a couple little things

1102
00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:34.112 line:80%
to make you...
make you more perfect.

1103
00:43:34.237 --> 00:43:35.822 line:80%
You know, make you more perfect
for me, right?

1104
00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:37.657 line:80%
Because that's relationships.

1105
00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.409 line:80%
You can't love someone
100 percent of the time, right?

1106
00:43:39.534 --> 00:43:41.286 line:80%
Yeah. Sure, I guess.

1107
00:43:41.411 --> 00:43:42.954 line:80%
Is that, like,
from The Bachelor or something?

1108
00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:44.205 line:80%
-Gary.
-Hmm.

1109
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:45.999 line:80%
You know how I always tell you

1110
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:47.208 line:80%
about that time machine,
and the nail salon's a dud,

1111
00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:48.877 line:80%
and it only goes back 24 hours?

1112
00:43:49.002 --> 00:43:50.712 line:80%
No. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking...

1113
00:43:50.837 --> 00:43:52.422 line:80%
Well, I was lying.

1114
00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:53.715 line:80%
See, there's something
that you should know.

1115
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.133 line:80%
It can go anywhere

1116
00:43:55.258 --> 00:43:58.011 line:80%
in the past,
but for only 24 hours.

1117
00:43:58.136 --> 00:43:59.679 line:80%
Then zap, you're back here.

1118
00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:02.098 line:80%
Okay, June.
That is a fascinating story.

1119
00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:04.142 line:80%
But I'd really like to go
kill myself now, all right?

1120
00:44:05.477 --> 00:44:07.520 line:80%
You sure? It's a second chance.

1121
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:09.481 line:80%
You can always kill yourself
later.

1122
00:44:09.606 --> 00:44:13.026 line:80%
Okay. Let's do it.
Let's fuck up some history, huh?

1123
00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:14.486 line:80%
-That's the spirit.
-Mm.

1124
00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:18.239 line:80%
And here I am,
24 hours in the past.

1125
00:44:19.574 --> 00:44:21.534 line:80%
Wow.

1126
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:23.161 line:80%
Wow!

1127
00:44:23.286 --> 00:44:24.788 line:80%
-Mmhmm.
-You can go back

1128
00:44:24.913 --> 00:44:27.791 line:80%
to any point in the past
and you chose yesterday.

1129
00:44:27.916 --> 00:44:29.417 line:80%
-Mmhmm.
-You didn't wanna go

1130
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:31.044 line:80%
somewhere more meaningful,
like I don't know,

1131
00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:32.170 line:80%
like, to kill Hitler?

1132
00:44:32.295 --> 00:44:33.588 line:80%
Well, I did take out Smithson.

1133
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:36.841 line:80%
-Who?
-Exactly.

1134
00:44:36.966 --> 00:44:38.551 line:80%
And Gary, I mean,
why yesterday?

1135
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.261 line:80%
I don't know.
I mean, technically speaking,

1136
00:44:40.387 --> 00:44:41.721 line:80%
it was actually June's fault,
she chose it.

1137
00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:43.223 line:80%
And let me tell you,
when I ended up

1138
00:44:43.348 --> 00:44:45.100 line:80%
24 hours in the past,
I was like,

1139
00:44:45.225 --> 00:44:46.893 line:80%
"What the fuck, June?"
I mean, life is already shit.

1140
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:48.770 line:80%
I don't need a reminder
of yesterday's shit, right?

1141
00:44:48.895 --> 00:44:50.647 line:80%
I kind of preferred, like,
nostalgic childhood shit,

1142
00:44:50.772 --> 00:44:52.649 line:80%
that could really, like...
But what are you gonna do?

1143
00:44:52.774 --> 00:44:54.109 line:80%
So, then I thought alcohol,
and I stumbled into that bar,

1144
00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:55.902 line:80%
and then I met you.

1145
00:44:56.027 --> 00:44:57.237 line:80%
And everything changed.

1146
00:44:59.072 --> 00:45:01.449 line:80%
Right. And that was a year ago.

1147
00:45:01.574 --> 00:45:02.951 line:80%
[clicks tongue] Technically,
yesterday. But, yes.

1148
00:45:03.076 --> 00:45:05.412 line:80%
We've been doing this
for an entire year,

1149
00:45:05.537 --> 00:45:09.165 line:80%
365 days to be exact.
In fact, it's, um...

1150
00:45:11.418 --> 00:45:12.419 line:80%
it's our anniversary, Gary.

1151
00:45:15.088 --> 00:45:16.256 line:80%
[Gary]
Hey.

1152
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:18.091 line:80%
Can I have the check, please?

1153
00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:19.008 line:80%
Happy anniversary.

1154
00:45:20.385 --> 00:45:21.678 line:80%
Gary, thank you so much
for dinner.

1155
00:45:21.803 --> 00:45:23.388 line:80%
It was delicious.

1156
00:45:23.513 --> 00:45:24.764 line:80%
So, should we head out
and find some dessert?

1157
00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:27.016 line:80%
Mm. I don't think so.

1158
00:45:27.142 --> 00:45:28.685 line:80%
You for uh, for Gary?

1159
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:30.395 line:80%
-[Driver] Uh, yeah.
-Yeah.

1160
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.355 line:80%
Look, I actually
have to be up kinda early,

1161
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.192 line:80%
and uh, I need my rest.
But this was great.

1162
00:45:36.317 --> 00:45:37.193 line:80%
This never happened
with old Gary.

1163
00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:38.653 line:80%
Yeah.

1164
00:45:38.778 --> 00:45:40.071 line:80%
I must have really done
a number on you.

1165
00:45:40.196 --> 00:45:42.657 line:80%
Wow. Changes I have made.

1166
00:45:42.782 --> 00:45:44.367 line:80%
-Mm. Yeah? Is that so?
-Hmm.

1167
00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:46.286 line:80%
-Hey, hey!
-Oh, I thought you were...

1168
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:47.954 line:80%
No, listen. Look.

1169
00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.539 line:80%
Not that I'm buying
any of your bullshit,

1170
00:45:49.664 --> 00:45:51.541 line:80%
future girl,
but just out of curiosity,

1171
00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.668 line:80%
just 'cause I wanna know,
what exactly did you change

1172
00:45:53.793 --> 00:45:55.587 line:80%
about me
that was so fucking awful?

1173
00:45:55.712 --> 00:45:57.589 line:80%
Oh, okay. So, we've spent
a lot of time together.

1174
00:45:57.714 --> 00:45:59.466 line:80%
And you've shared
a lot with me. Okay?

1175
00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:01.551 line:80%
Like, I know
all about your childhood,

1176
00:46:01.676 --> 00:46:03.344 line:80%
your disappointments,
the ups and downs,

1177
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:05.805 line:80%
all the traumas, and I've kinda
like narrowed them down

1178
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.849 line:80%
to the moments that aided
in your mental decline.

1179
00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:10.685 line:80%
I call them the "Where things
went wrong for Gary" moments.

1180
00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:11.895 line:80%
Oh. Is that what you call them?

1181
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.521 line:80%
Hey! Dial down the sarcasm.

1182
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:15.398 line:80%
It's our fucking anniversary.

1183
00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:17.066 line:80%
So, anyway, I traveled
back there, and I fixed them.

1184
00:46:17.192 --> 00:46:18.234 line:80%
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1185
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:19.277 line:80%
Give me an example of one.

1186
00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:20.612 line:80%
-One.
-Fine!

1187
00:46:23.114 --> 00:46:25.617 line:80%
-Yes.
-You're Gary, right?

1188
00:46:25.742 --> 00:46:26.868 line:80%
-Mom!
-[Sheila clears throat]

1189
00:46:26.993 --> 00:46:28.495 line:80%
My name is Charlie,

1190
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:29.662 line:80%
and I just moved in
across the street.

1191
00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:31.414 line:80%
Okay.

1192
00:46:31.539 --> 00:46:34.751 line:80%
May I interest you
in a friendly game of catch?

1193
00:46:34.876 --> 00:46:36.461 line:80%
I'm not supposed to talk
to strangers.

1194
00:46:36.586 --> 00:46:38.421 line:80%
Can I tell you a little secret?

1195
00:46:38.546 --> 00:46:41.883 line:80%
I lost my son many years ago
in a boating accident, actually.

1196
00:46:42.008 --> 00:46:43.801 line:80%
And it makes me very, very,
very sad.

1197
00:46:43.927 --> 00:46:45.762 line:80%
And I... I miss him so much.

1198
00:46:45.887 --> 00:46:47.722 line:80%
It would truly mean the world
to me if you would humor

1199
00:46:47.847 --> 00:46:49.474 line:80%
an old man

1200
00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.559 line:80%
and play a friendly game
of catch out in the yard.

1201
00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:52.477 line:80%
What do you say, sport?

1202
00:46:54.354 --> 00:46:55.230 line:80%
Okay.

1203
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.483 line:80%
You should watch more wrestling.

1204
00:46:58.608 --> 00:47:00.360 line:80%
The fake kind.

1205
00:47:00.485 --> 00:47:02.737 line:80%
-It's not fake.
-It’s pretty fake, kid.

1206
00:47:02.862 --> 00:47:05.448 line:80%
A lot of people are gonna say
you're wrong, Gary.

1207
00:47:05.573 --> 00:47:07.116 line:80%
-Fuck 'em.
-Okay.

1208
00:47:09.244 --> 00:47:10.411 line:80%
Oh, God. Gary, no.

1209
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:13.748 line:80%
My miming's good, right?

1210
00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:15.625 line:80%
[Sheila]
Gary, no. Don't do that.

1211
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.502 line:80%
People don't like mimes.

1212
00:47:17.627 --> 00:47:19.128 line:80%
Please don't do that again.

1213
00:47:19.254 --> 00:47:20.129 line:80%
[Gary]
Hey, wait. Just wait a second.

1214
00:47:20.255 --> 00:47:21.256 line:80%
[Sheila]
What?

1215
00:47:21.381 --> 00:47:22.382 line:80%
You were Uncle Charlie?

1216
00:47:22.507 --> 00:47:23.675 line:80%
It was I.

1217
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.134 line:80%
You're so fucking crazy.

1218
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.886 line:80%
-That's fucking crazy.
-Why?

1219
00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:28.555 line:80%
We just played a little catch.
Big deal!

1220
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.181 line:80%
Sheila, I played catch

1221
00:47:30.306 --> 00:47:31.516 line:80%
with Uncle Charlie
every Sunday afternoon

1222
00:47:31.641 --> 00:47:33.226 line:80%
-for like three years!
-I know.

1223
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:35.144 line:80%
Gary, what can I say?
I'm very methodical.

1224
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:36.688 line:80%
I went back a bunch to make
a difference in your life.

1225
00:47:36.813 --> 00:47:38.314 line:80%
You're welcome.

1226
00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:39.649 line:80%
How do you not see
how fucked up this is?

1227
00:47:39.774 --> 00:47:41.943 line:80%
-What?
-What? I loved that guy.

1228
00:47:42.068 --> 00:47:46.739 line:80%
I fucking loved Uncle Charlie.
He was like my dad.

1229
00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:48.324 line:80%
I know! That is the whole point.

1230
00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:49.826 line:80%
No, it's not the point.

1231
00:47:49.951 --> 00:47:51.411 line:80%
You can't just choose
for people.

1232
00:47:51.536 --> 00:47:53.037 line:80%
You can't just do that.

1233
00:47:53.162 --> 00:47:54.789 line:80%
You can't just put
a positive influence,

1234
00:47:54.914 --> 00:47:56.666 line:80%
and pawn 'em on someone,
and hope it all works out.

1235
00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:58.835 line:80%
You can't fucking do that!
That's not how life works!

1236
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.044 line:80%
What else did you change?

1237
00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:01.629 line:80%
Well, just I... a couple things.

1238
00:48:01.754 --> 00:48:03.172 line:80%
I just deleted a few people.

1239
00:48:03.298 --> 00:48:05.258 line:80%
You know, like
your middle school bully,

1240
00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:09.012 line:80%
Patrick, and your math teacher,
Mrs. Kaiser, and Amber, duh!

1241
00:48:09.137 --> 00:48:10.555 line:80%
Oh my God!

1242
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.639 line:80%
But that's all.
That's all. That's all.

1243
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:12.932 line:80%
What, that's all? That's all?

1244
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:14.017 line:80%
Actually, no.
There is one more thing.

1245
00:48:14.142 --> 00:48:14.934 line:80%
[knocking]

1246
00:48:16.436 --> 00:48:17.562 line:80%
[Tatiana]
Hey, kiddo. How's it going?

1247
00:48:17.687 --> 00:48:19.105 line:80%
I heard you ordered a pizza.

1248
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.523 line:80%
Oh, I didn't order a...

1249
00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:21.691 line:80%
Oh my God. Tatiana?

1250
00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:23.359 line:80%
I lost my virginity to her.

1251
00:48:23.484 --> 00:48:25.278 line:80%
-Oh, you're welcome!
-You're unbelievable.

1252
00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:27.322 line:80%
You're un-fucking-believable.
You're fucking psychotic.

1253
00:48:27.447 --> 00:48:28.573 line:80%
Hey! That is not fair!

1254
00:48:28.698 --> 00:48:30.533 line:80%
I've heard you talk
about your pain

1255
00:48:30.658 --> 00:48:32.035 line:80%
over, and over, and over,
night, after night, after night.

1256
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.786 line:80%
And it has broken my heart.

1257
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:35.955 line:80%
I have this unique ability
to take your pain away.

1258
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.415 line:80%
Well, guess what?

1259
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.750 line:80%
It's not yours to take away,
Sheila!

1260
00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:40.126 line:80%
It came from a good place, Gary!

1261
00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:42.211 line:80%
Yeah. So did gender
reveal parties.

1262
00:48:42.337 --> 00:48:44.005 line:80%
You know what? I don't need
your fucking attitude right now.

1263
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.548 line:80%
I'm just gonna go back,
and I'm gonna tweak a few things

1264
00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:46.591 line:80%
and fix this,
so this didn't happen.

1265
00:48:46.716 --> 00:48:48.217 line:80%
Oh, well, go ahead. Go.

1266
00:48:48.343 --> 00:48:49.636 line:80%
Do whatever you want.
'Cause guess what?

1267
00:48:49.761 --> 00:48:50.845 line:80%
I'll still
never wanna be with you.

1268
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:51.888 line:80%
No, not true. I will reset you.

1269
00:48:52.013 --> 00:48:53.181 line:80%
You'll remember nothing.

1270
00:48:53.306 --> 00:48:55.183 line:80%
-Easy.
-[Gary] Yeah, yeah.

1271
00:48:55.308 --> 00:48:56.267 line:80%
-I will remember it actually.
-No, you won't remember it.

1272
00:48:56.392 --> 00:48:57.268 line:80%
[Gary]
Yeah, I will.

1273
00:48:57.393 --> 00:48:58.269 line:80%
-Really?
-Yeah.

1274
00:48:58.394 --> 00:48:59.270 line:80%
A Sharpie, Gary.

1275
00:48:59.395 --> 00:49:00.313 line:80%
You are so dumb!

1276
00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:01.397 line:80%
Yeah. Sheila sucks balls.

1277
00:49:01.522 --> 00:49:03.358 line:80%
You can't even spell.

1278
00:49:03.483 --> 00:49:04.567 line:80%
That's not going to be there
tomorrow, do you understand?

1279
00:49:04.692 --> 00:49:06.194 line:80%
Fine, yeah. Maybe it won't.

1280
00:49:06.319 --> 00:49:07.695 line:80%
Maybe I won't remember
this conversation.

1281
00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.322 line:80%
Maybe I won't remember
this night.

1282
00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:10.823 line:80%
Maybe I won't remember
those two ladies.

1283
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:12.408 line:80%
But I will remember
this feeling.

1284
00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:13.826 line:80%
Gary, I've done this
hundreds of times.

1285
00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:15.787 line:80%
-And you never remember.
-Oh, yeah?

1286
00:49:15.912 --> 00:49:17.497 line:80%
Were all of our dates
this shitty?

1287
00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:19.415 line:80%
Actually, no.
You used to fucking love them!

1288
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.917 line:80%
Oh, I used to fucking love them.

1289
00:49:21.042 --> 00:49:22.710 line:80%
I wonder what happened.
I don't know.

1290
00:49:22.835 --> 00:49:25.171 line:80%
D... do you realize
you can't erase everything?

1291
00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:27.965 line:80%
No. It's because relationships
need work, Gary.

1292
00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:29.801 line:80%
We just have to work on it.
That's all.

1293
00:49:29.926 --> 00:49:31.928 line:80%
Well, maybe, just maybe you try
to make things better,

1294
00:49:32.053 --> 00:49:33.221 line:80%
but you actually
make them worse.

1295
00:49:33.346 --> 00:49:34.931 line:80%
And maybe some shit sticks.

1296
00:49:35.056 --> 00:49:36.557 line:80%
No. That's not how this works.

1297
00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:37.809 line:80%
No, Gary.
I will prove you wrong.

1298
00:49:37.934 --> 00:49:39.102 line:80%
I will fucking prove you wrong!

1299
00:49:39.227 --> 00:49:41.312 line:80%
Oh, yeah? Good luck!

1300
00:49:41.437 --> 00:49:43.106 line:80%
[scream]

1301
00:49:43.231 --> 00:49:44.899 line:80%
Personally, I think
that he should feel touched

1302
00:49:45.024 --> 00:49:46.776 line:80%
that somebody cares so deeply

1303
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:51.197 line:80%
to take away all the pain
of his life.

1304
00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:52.615 line:80%
Oh.

1305
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.035 line:80%
That is a really
romantic gesture.

1306
00:50:00.081 --> 00:50:01.666 line:80%
-[groans]
-Oh, it's okay.

1307
00:50:01.791 --> 00:50:02.917 line:80%
[shushes] No, no, no.
It's fine.

1308
00:50:03.042 --> 00:50:05.044 line:80%
[shushes] Slowly okay, fine.

1309
00:50:05.169 --> 00:50:08.965 line:80%
[both scream]

1310
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.259 line:80%
Gary.
Here's your sexy pizza, Gary.

1311
00:50:11.384 --> 00:50:13.761 line:80%
Yeah, okay.

1312
00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:15.847 line:80%
Dammit! Wait.

1313
00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:17.473 line:80%
And then the karate instructor,

1314
00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:18.641 line:80%
he did not put up
a fight at all.

1315
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:20.476 line:80%
It was very surprising.

1316
00:50:20.601 --> 00:50:22.520 line:80%
But then I came over to get you,
little, cute Tatiana.

1317
00:50:22.645 --> 00:50:24.063 line:80%
She doesn't deserve that.
I couldn't do it.

1318
00:50:24.188 --> 00:50:26.566 line:80%
So, you know,
that's why we're here.

1319
00:50:26.691 --> 00:50:28.901 line:80%
Hmm.

1320
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:30.361 line:80%
Hello?

1321
00:50:30.486 --> 00:50:32.196 line:80%
Oh, maybe next year, Gary.

1322
00:50:32.321 --> 00:50:33.990 line:80%
Shut the door.

1323
00:50:34.115 --> 00:50:34.907 line:80%
Come on.

1324
00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:38.786 line:80%
Cute kid.

1325
00:50:38.911 --> 00:50:40.288 line:80%
He will be.

1326
00:50:40.413 --> 00:50:41.456 line:80%
[time machine whirs]

1327
00:50:44.584 --> 00:50:46.502 line:80%
[Sheila groans]

1328
00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:47.754 line:80%
June.

1329
00:50:47.879 --> 00:50:49.797 line:80%
[sighs] I did it.

1330
00:50:49.922 --> 00:50:54.218 line:80%
Yeah. I did it right.
I... I undid it, rather. Oh.

1331
00:50:54.343 --> 00:50:56.220 line:80%
[chuckles]

1332
00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:59.265 line:80%
Now, me and Gary can go back
to the way things used to be.

1333
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:01.225 line:80%
[chuckles]
Okay.

1334
00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.060 line:80%
Mmhmm. Okay, what?

1335
00:51:03.186 --> 00:51:04.729 line:80%
[June] In all the times
that you've done this,

1336
00:51:04.854 --> 00:51:06.481 line:80%
have things ever gone back
to the way they used to be?

1337
00:51:06.606 --> 00:51:10.234 line:80%
Oh, God. You know, you
sound like evil Gary, R.I.P.

1338
00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:12.487 line:80%
Probably is covered
in black marker by now,

1339
00:51:12.612 --> 00:51:14.739 line:80%
whining, "Oh,
I have residual feelings.

1340
00:51:14.864 --> 00:51:17.158 line:80%
And when will they ever
go away?"

1341
00:51:17.283 --> 00:51:19.535 line:80%
Shit sticks, my ass.

1342
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.746 line:80%
Well, some shit does stick.

1343
00:51:21.871 --> 00:51:22.789 line:80%
Come on, no!

1344
00:51:22.914 --> 00:51:24.290 line:80%
No! That is not fair.

1345
00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:25.917 line:80%
That is not what we talked
about.

1346
00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:29.045 line:80%
Where is the fucking manual
for this thing?

1347
00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.214 line:80%
Sheila, in the 300 plus times
that you've come into this shop,

1348
00:51:31.339 --> 00:51:34.425 line:80%
have you ever once thought
to ask about me, about my life?

1349
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.177 line:80%
No.

1350
00:51:36.302 --> 00:51:38.054 line:80%
I've been very self-involved.
I am not proud of it.

1351
00:51:38.179 --> 00:51:41.182 line:80%
Okay. Well, my parents
wanted a boy.

1352
00:51:41.307 --> 00:51:43.851 line:80%
They wanted a boy so badly
that when I was born,

1353
00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:45.436 line:80%
they called me a mistake.

1354
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:47.104 line:80%
And then they treated me
like a mistake.

1355
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:48.648 line:80%
Oh my God.

1356
00:51:48.773 --> 00:51:51.442 line:80%
June, that's terrible.
I'm so sorry.

1357
00:51:51.567 --> 00:51:53.736 line:80%
Yeah. So, when I was old enough
to fend for myself,

1358
00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:54.695 line:80%
I murdered both of them.

1359
00:51:56.322 --> 00:51:57.782 line:80%
What?

1360
00:51:57.907 --> 00:52:00.076 line:80%
-Really?
-No, not really, Sheila.

1361
00:52:00.201 --> 00:52:02.662 line:80%
But I did move to Bed-Stuy
with a woman who is now my wife.

1362
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:04.038 line:80%
So, in many ways,
I did murder them.

1363
00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:05.998 line:80%
[Sheila]
Oh, wow.

1364
00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:06.999 line:80%
You know, I gotta tell you,
it sounds like you handled

1365
00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:08.167 line:80%
that shit like a champ.

1366
00:52:08.292 --> 00:52:09.919 line:80%
But hello, spoiler alert.

1367
00:52:10.044 --> 00:52:11.379 line:80%
I have a time machine.
I could go back.

1368
00:52:11.504 --> 00:52:12.839 line:80%
Talk to your parents.

1369
00:52:12.964 --> 00:52:14.799 line:80%
Remind them
what a treasure you are.

1370
00:52:14.924 --> 00:52:17.426 line:80%
They'll love you from the start.
And bam, trauma eliminated.

1371
00:52:17.552 --> 00:52:20.263 line:80%
Don't fuck with my trauma,
Sheila.

1372
00:52:20.388 --> 00:52:21.764 line:80%
If I didn't have
these occasional moments

1373
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:24.141 line:80%
of complete
and total worthlessness,

1374
00:52:24.267 --> 00:52:27.520 line:80%
I wouldn't have this
sparkling sense of humor.

1375
00:52:27.645 --> 00:52:29.146 line:80%
Okay. Wow. Cool.

1376
00:52:29.272 --> 00:52:31.190 line:80%
It's good for you.
But you know, for me,

1377
00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:35.361 line:80%
I have realized
that I can undo anything.

1378
00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:36.529 line:80%
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

1379
00:52:36.654 --> 00:52:38.239 line:80%
[June]
No, you can't.

1380
00:52:38.364 --> 00:52:40.658 line:80%
Sometimes, people cut you,
and they leave an imprint

1381
00:52:40.783 --> 00:52:42.577 line:80%
on you, that's like a gash
on your soul.

1382
00:52:42.702 --> 00:52:43.911 line:80%
You just live with it.

1383
00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:45.454 line:80%
And you can't actually
undo that.

1384
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.916 line:80%
If you erase the pain,
you erase the person.

1385
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:50.459 line:80%
Do you get it, Sheila?

1386
00:52:52.086 --> 00:52:53.880 line:80%
No.

1387
00:52:54.005 --> 00:52:55.756 line:80%
I mean, yes.

1388
00:52:55.882 --> 00:52:57.800 line:80%
I mean, I'm just not gonna
apply it to my situation.

1389
00:52:57.925 --> 00:52:58.801 line:80%
Why?

1390
00:52:58.926 --> 00:53:00.887 line:80%
Because I don't know, June.

1391
00:53:01.012 --> 00:53:02.638 line:80%
People apply
other people's lessons

1392
00:53:02.763 --> 00:53:04.640 line:80%
to their lives all the time
very willy-nilly.

1393
00:53:04.765 --> 00:53:06.934 line:80%
And before you know, it, bam,
Smithson's president, okay?

1394
00:53:07.059 --> 00:53:08.603 line:80%
Doesn't matter. Listen.

1395
00:53:08.728 --> 00:53:10.646 line:80%
I have a date

Yeah, Phil. I'm real thirsty,

1941
01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.713 line:80%
but not for your side
commentary.

1942
01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:50.591 line:80%
I'm pretty quenched
on that account. Okay?

1943
01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.468 line:80%
So, I gotta ask.

1944
01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:54.178 line:80%

You know, Michael Beihn
was in that movie.

1947
01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:02.061 line:80%
And... and then... and nothing.

1948
01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:04.146 line:80%
It's all just like a big joke
to you, isn't it?

1949
01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:05.940 line:80%
You just don't take any of it
seriously.

1950
01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:07.692 line:80%
It's fine.

1951
01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:09.193 line:80%
Neurotic. I, like, developed
these coping mechanisms,

1952
01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.028 line:80%
you know, to keep myself sane.

1953
01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.363 line:80%
I wasn't like murdering people!

1954
01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:13.781 line:80%
-Oh, good!
-Like you.

1955
01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:15.116 line:80%
There's a lot of choices
over here.

1956
01:23:15.241 --> 01:23:16.117 line:80%
-There are. Ooh!
-Let's go to this one.

1957
01:23:16.242 --> 01:23:18.035 line:80%
Hi, Amit!

1958
01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.620 line:80%
[Gary] So, you wanna tell me
about the future?

1959
01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:21.539 line:80%
What's the point?
You never believe me anyways.

1960
01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:22.623 line:80%
The point is, it's interesting.

1961
01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:24.750 line:80%
-Mm.
-Mm!

1962
01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.877 line:80%
So, I have a cat. Uh...

-Old-fashioned.
-Old-fashioned.

1964
01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:29.296 line:80%
I'm allergic to them.

1965
01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:30.297 line:80%
So, I had to get
one of those shaved ones.

1968
01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:34.260 line:80%
They're called a "sphinx".

1969
01:23:34.385 --> 01:23:35.886 line:80%
Um, but it's weird.
If you put them up

1970
01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:38.055 line:80%
next to my grandfather,
you kinda can't tell

1971
01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:38.973 line:80%
the difference.

You're not even
gonna remember this.

01:23:44.562 --> 01:23:47.440 line:80%
And it just makes me
so, so, so sad, Gary, you know?

1975
01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:52.486 line:80%
The future is fucked!
Let's liven it up in here.

1983
01:24:07.001 --> 01:24:08.836 line:80%

1990
01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:24.101 line:80%
I guess what I'm tryna say

1991
01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:26.061 line:80%
is I haven't done this
in a long time.
