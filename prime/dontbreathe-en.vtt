-Sure you got the right keys?
-It's the right key.

2
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.224 line:83%
-Okay, then, open the door.
-It shouldn't be taking so long, man.

3
00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:26.230 line:83%
-Twenty, 19, 18...
-Rocky, those are very slow seconds.

4
00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:28.065 line:83%
-...17, 16...
-Yo, kill that already.

5
00:02:28.232 --> 00:02:32.528 line:83%
-Dude, come on.
-...15, 14, 13, 12...

6
00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:36.991 line:83%
-This is what I'm talking about.
-...11, 10, nine....

7
00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:41.787 line:83%
I told you this was gonna be fancy.

8
00:02:44.123 --> 00:02:46.333 line:83%
All right, so just like last time. No cash.

9
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.753 line:83%
-The total take has to fall below 10 G's.
-Yeah, whatever, Judge Judy.

10
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.797 line:83%
-Come on.
-Let's do this.

11
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.330 line:83%
Okay, let's get out of here.

12
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.576 line:83%
Hey, Rocky, did you hear
that Kopecky's moving away?

13
00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.620 line:83%
Everybody's leaving.

14
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:10.209 line:83%
You know, we keep hitting houses
like today's, Rocky, and....

15
00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:12.419 line:83%
Bye-bye, Detroit.

16
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:16.215 line:83%
And
hola,
California.

17
00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:21.387 line:83%
-Wait, wait. You're going away, Rock?
-Yeah, as soon as I can.

18
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.766 line:83%
When are you--
When are you coming back?

19
00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:27.351 line:83%
Never.

20
00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:31.730 line:83%
You should come with us.

21
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:33.983 line:83%
What?

22
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.901 line:83%
Everyone else is gone.

23
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:37.987 line:83%
I got my dad here.

24
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.740 line:83%
I'll miss you, then.

25
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.975 line:83%
Dad?

26
00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:11.270 line:83%
You're home?

27
00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.734 line:83%
Yo, this is it, man?

28
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.320 line:83%
Minus my 40 percent.

29
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.571 line:83%
Take it or leave it.

30
00:06:02.738 --> 00:06:05.616 line:83%
-There's a fucking Rolex in there, bro.
-What do you think...

31
00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:08.452 line:83%
...I'm gonna put it up
for auction at Sotheby's?

32
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:15.501 line:83%
You know how much people on the street
pay for a hot Rolex?

33
00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:17.961 line:83%
You want money?

34
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:21.548 line:83%
-Then steal money.
-Fucking bullshit, bro.

35
00:06:23.175 --> 00:06:25.803 line:83%
You want this new tip or not?

36
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.350 line:83%
All right, let's hear it.

37
00:06:31.517 --> 00:06:35.687 line:83%
1837 Buena Vista Street. House
is with your dad's security company.

38
00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.272 line:83%
I already checked.

39
00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.651 line:83%
Guy who owns it
is an Army vet loner.

40
00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:41.819 line:83%
No family.

41
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.112 line:83%
Just him in the house.

42
00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.906 line:83%
-That part of the city is a ghost town.
-Looks like a dump.

43
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:47.324 line:83%
That's actually good news.

44
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:48.784 line:83%
How is that good news?

45
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.285 line:83%
Well, the story goes...

46
00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.705 line:83%
...some preppy girl a few years ago
ran over this guy's daughter.

47
00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.749 line:83%
-Jesus.
-The daughter dies...

48
00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.836 line:83%
...and this preppy, rich-ass family...

49
00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.839 line:83%
...pays him off,
gives him a big-ass sediment.

50
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.715 line:83%
Settlement.

51
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.342 line:83%
Blow me, Your Honor.

52
00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.097 line:83%
All right, this guy
is sitting on at least...

53
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.267 line:83%
...300K.

54
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.729 line:83%
I mean, if I deliver
this stake to Raul, man...

55
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.398 line:83%
...he will shit his pants.

56
00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:21.733 line:83%
Do you think the money's
in the house?

57
00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.986 line:83%
I don't know. Let's go find out.

58
00:07:24.153 --> 00:07:25.654 line:83%
Guys, no. We don't do cash.

59
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:28.574 line:83%
Above 10 K, it's major larceny.
Ten years if we get caught.

60
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.701 line:83%
-We won't get caught.
-And then what?

61
00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:34.163 line:83%
That amount brings a serious cop
presence. They'll do an investigation.

62
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:37.040 line:83%
-My dad could get in trouble.
-I knew you'd bitch out, man.

63
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.417 line:83%
-I just knew it.
-Alex...

64
00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:41.837 line:83%
...if we do this right,
we never have to do it again.

65
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.095 line:83%
Where are you going?

66
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:53.140 line:83%
We're not doing this one.

67
00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:55.267 line:83%
Seriously?

68
00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.644 line:83%
Give us the fucking keys, man.

69
00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.062 line:83%
-We'll fucking do it.
-Alex!

70
00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:36.683 line:83%
"Gulf War veteran reaches
six-figure settlement."

71
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:40.354 line:83%
Six-figure settlement.

72
00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.898 line:83%
All right.

73
00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.075 line:83%
The suspect was leaving
the rear entrance.

74
00:08:53.242 --> 00:08:55.202 line:83%
You done, Diddy?

75
00:08:57.913 --> 00:09:01.333 line:83%
Be a doll and get your mother
a large four-cheese from Tony's.

76
00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:04.753 line:83%
-So Trevor's living here now?
-Don't be a bitch, Roxanne.

77
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.090 line:83%
It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

78
00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:09.967 line:83%
You have no money in here.

79
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.969 line:83%
You pay for it then.

80
00:09:13.262 --> 00:09:15.013 line:83%
I know you're making money.

81
00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.186 line:83%
I'm done.

82
00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.188 line:83%
Your lips look sore.

83
00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.649 line:83%
That's how you're making
your cash out there?

84
00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:33.657 line:83%
Okay, Diddy, let's go for a walk.

85
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.743 line:83%
I want to go to the beach.

86
00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:40.539 line:83%
Yeah, well,
it's not summer, monkeyhead.

87
00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:42.541 line:83%
I want to be a surfer.

88
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.503 line:83%
There's no surf in Michigan.

89
00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:51.091 line:83%
-Not fair.
-Yeah, well...

90
00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:56.346 line:83%
...some things
you can't change, baby.

91
00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:57.973 line:83%
No matter how unfair they are.

92
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.350 line:83%
What a bummer.

93
00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.190 line:83%
Hey, you know
where there is surf?

94
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:12.362 line:83%
California. What do you say
you and I move there together?

95
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.613 line:83%
Would you like that?

96
00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.825 line:83%
Okay. I promise, then.

97
00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.446 line:83%
Is that a new tattoo?

98
00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.697 line:83%
Yeah.

99
00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.032 line:83%
I got it last night.

100
00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.411 line:83%
-Is it a...?
-Ladybug.

101
00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.579 line:83%
Why a ladybug?

102
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.752 line:83%
What?

103
00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:56.133 line:83%
When my dad left,
my mom started drinking...

104
00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.760 line:83%
...and she told me that...

105
00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:02.472 line:83%
...my dad's leaving was all my fault.

106
00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.769 line:83%
And I missed him a lot, so I'd cry.

107
00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:10.480 line:83%
She got so fed up with the crying...

108
00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:13.483 line:83%
...that she would lock me
in the trunk of her car.

109
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.735 line:83%
Sometimes for hours.

110
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.156 line:83%
But there was this....

111
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.285 line:83%
A little hole in the trunk...

112
00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:25.662 line:83%
...and one time a ladybug flew in...

113
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:28.039 line:83%
...kept me company.

114
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.209 line:83%
It made me feel safe.

115
00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:35.297 line:83%
When I reach California,
I'll color this tat...

116
00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:38.300 line:83%
...and that's the last time
I will mark my body.

117
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:48.643 line:83%
If we get this money,
I'm going away with you guys.

118
00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:53.440 line:83%
I know you will.

119
00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.073 line:83%
At least four blocks around,
houses aren't occupied.

120
00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:05.952 line:83%
No people means no Five-0 on patrol.

121
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.497 line:83%
It's gonna be a piece of cake.

122
00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:11.500 line:83%
The guy's a shut-in,
hasn't left his house in like five days.

123
00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:15.295 line:83%
I say we do it with him in the house.
I'll get a chloro-bomb.

124
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.716 line:83%
-Jesus.
-Get off my fucking car, dog shit!

125
00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.143 line:83%
Shit, that's our guy.

126
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:39.945 line:83%
Wait, is he blind?

127
00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:43.365 line:83%
He lost his sight in Iraq or something.

128
00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:45.867 line:83%
Kind of fucked up to rob a blind guy,
isn't it?

129
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:49.037 line:83%
Just because he's blind
don't mean he's a fucking saint, bro.

130
00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:52.916 line:83%
We do this tonight.

131
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.068 line:83%
The whole neighborhood
is fucking empty.

132
00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:23.321 line:83%
This guy's the last man standing.

133
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:28.243 line:83%
The lights are out. He must be asleep.

134
00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.328 line:83%
He's blind.

135
00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.956 line:83%
-Lights off doesn't mean anything.
-It's 2 a.m.

136
00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.958 line:83%
He's sleeping.

137
00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.628 line:83%
Let's take care
of that dog first, yeah?

138
00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.778 line:83%
Come on, man.

139
00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.000 line:83%
He's chewing it.
It'll be lights out in a sec.

140
00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:26.384 line:83%
There's four locks.
You got the other keys?

141
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:29.512 line:83%
-I only have the one.
-Fuck me.

142
00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:33.808 line:83%
Why wouldn't he give backup keys
to the security company?

143
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.479 line:83%
Because the money's in there and
the paranoid fuck doesn't trust nobody.

144
00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:39.356 line:83%
Let's check for a side door.

145
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.435 line:83%
Sweet dreams, pup.

146
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.502 line:83%
What's that?

147
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:46.464 line:83%
We point this in the general direction
of the master keypad, it'll kill the alarm.

148
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:48.341 line:83%
Okay, open the fucking door, Dexter.

149
00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.389 line:83%
Yes. Got it.

150
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.640 line:83%
Shit.

151
00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.435 line:83%
-What's wrong?
-It won't open it.

152
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.115 line:83%
This guy isn't messing around.

153
00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.826 line:83%
There's a bolt here.

154
00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:16.911 line:83%
I can feel it.

155
00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.456 line:83%
-Come on.
-That's too loud. That's too loud.

156
00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:20.665 line:83%
Fucking stop.

157
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:24.919 line:83%
What about that window?

158
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.130 line:83%
There's no bars on it.

159
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:28.506 line:83%
-I can fit in there.
-What?

160
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.760 line:83%
No, we're not sending you
in there alone.

161
00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.470 line:83%
Nobody's sending me anywhere.

162
00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.638 line:83%
I'm going myself.

163
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.102 line:83%
-Help me up.
-Here, Rocky.

164
00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.605 line:83%
-You only got 30 seconds.
-Okay.

165
00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.648 line:83%
Here. Come here.

166
00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:50.356 line:83%
Slow your roll, fool.

167
00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.734 line:83%
She must have got it by now.
She's fine.

168
00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:57.822 line:83%
-Yeah, like you really give a fuck.
-What'd you say?

169
00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.158 line:83%
That's my bitch in there.

170
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.243 line:83%
Of course I give a fuck.

171
00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:06.372 line:83%
Let me give you some advice.
Be a good friend...

172
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.208 line:83%
...and stay in the fucking
friend zone, all right?

173
00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.130 line:83%
You okay?

174
00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.548 line:83%
Yes.

175
00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.467 line:83%
Shoes off.

176
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.389 line:83%
-What the fuck?
-Hey.

177
00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.772 line:83%
Hey. Hey.

178
00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:56.733 line:83%
Okay.

179
00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:36.564 line:83%
Just three seeds, right?

180
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.649 line:83%
Just three?

181
00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:41.819 line:83%
One, two...

182
00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:44.530 line:83%
...and three.

183
00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:47.450 line:83%
Put three seeds in there...

184
00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:51.162 line:83%
...and the cup is all empty.

185
00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:54.749 line:83%
Now you water it?

186
00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:57.085 line:83%
Okay, now we water it.

187
00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:59.504 line:83%
Okay, Mom.

188
00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:03.007 line:83%
Then it takes the water.

189
00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:12.558 line:83%
Just three seeds.

190
00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:14.560 line:83%
What are you doing?

191
00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:17.146 line:83%
Planting a tree.

192
00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:21.651 line:83%
How big is the tree gonna get?

193
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:24.946 line:83%
As big as the sky!

194
00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:32.787 line:83%
What does a tree need to grow?

195
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.207 line:83%
Water, seeds, soil...

196
00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:38.584 line:83%
...and sun.

197
00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:40.503 line:83%
Sounds good.

198
00:24:07.905 --> 00:24:09.073 line:83%
Then it will grow.

199
00:24:12.743 --> 00:24:15.454 line:83%
Mom, can I have more water?

200
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.325 line:83%
Done.

201
00:24:53.284 --> 00:24:54.285 line:83%
What the fuck, dude?

202
00:24:54.452 --> 00:24:55.536 line:83%
The guy's gassed out.

203
00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:57.997 line:83%
He's out.
He's in Sleeping Beauty mode.

204
00:24:58.164 --> 00:24:59.916 line:83%
-It's fine.
-Guys.

205
00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:05.838 line:83%
That's a big-ass lock.

206
00:25:06.005 --> 00:25:08.591 line:83%
If the money's in the house...

207
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:10.801 line:83%
...probably in there.

208
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.095 line:83%
You think you can crack it open?

209
00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:14.639 line:83%
Yeah, I got this.

210
00:25:24.774 --> 00:25:25.942 line:83%
Fuck.

211
00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:31.489 line:83%
Jesus.

212
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:36.410 line:83%
-Do you have anything else?
-Yeah.

213
00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:38.537 line:83%
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:41.123 line:83%
I've got a more powerful tool.

215
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:45.211 line:83%
-What the hell is that?
-It's a 9 mm Beretta.

216
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.505 line:83%
Gangster-style, bitches.

217
00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:48.965 line:83%
Why'd you bring a gun?

218
00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:52.093 line:83%
This is a soldier's house.
Like I'm gonna come in here...

219
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.596 line:83%
-...without some chrome.
-Money, you've never shot a gun before.

220
00:25:55.763 --> 00:25:57.640 line:83%
Yeah, well, it's time
to pop that cherry.

221
00:25:57.807 --> 00:25:59.642 line:83%
I'm gonna pop that shit
like a tuna can.

222
00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:02.645 line:83%
Do you have any idea what
bringing a gun to a burglary means?

223
00:26:02.812 --> 00:26:06.315 line:83%
Yeah, it gives me a better chance
to defend myself, Alex.

224
00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:09.902 line:83%
No, it means you just gave this guy
the legal right to shoot us.

225
00:26:10.653 --> 00:26:12.196 line:83%
Rocky, let's go.

226
00:26:12.363 --> 00:26:14.573 line:83%
No, no, no. I think we should stay.

227
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.826 line:83%
We have to leave. This is not good.

228
00:26:18.286 --> 00:26:21.789 line:83%
You don't really think just because
you jerk off to her Instagram selfies...

229
00:26:21.956 --> 00:26:23.291 line:83%
...that makes you a Romeo?

230
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:26.377 line:83%
Think again, bitch.

231
00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:40.933 line:83%
Fuck, I'm so out.

232
00:26:43.978 --> 00:26:45.271 line:83%
Alex.

233
00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:02.747 line:83%
Who-- Who's there?

234
00:27:14.967 --> 00:27:17.219 line:83%
Okay, man, just chill, all right?

235
00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:20.681 line:83%
Look...

236
00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:23.351 line:83%
...I was wasted,
and I wandered in...

237
00:27:23.517 --> 00:27:25.102 line:83%
...so that was my bad, all right?

238
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:28.230 line:83%
So I'm just gonna--
I'm just gonna leave, okay?

239
00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:44.455 line:83%
Stay right fucking there.

240
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:46.791 line:83%
Don't you fucking move.

241
00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.503 line:83%
Yeah, that's right.

242
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:53.172 line:83%
I know what's in there,
and I ain't leaving without it.

243
00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:54.882 line:83%
You got me?

244
00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:57.968 line:83%
Now, you do as I say, all right?

245
00:27:58.135 --> 00:28:00.471 line:83%
Don't take one single step, all right?

246
00:28:05.434 --> 00:28:07.436 line:83%
Well, do you hear me or what?

247
00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:11.232 line:83%
What, are you blind and deaf
all of a sudden?

248
00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:14.819 line:83%
Motherfucker, I said stop.

249
00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:16.987 line:83%
I think you fucking heard me.

250
00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:19.532 line:83%
-Sorry.
-Don't you move.

251
00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:23.369 line:83%
What the fuck are you doing,
you old man? I'll fucking shoot you.

252
00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:27.331 line:83%
Don't you fucking test me.

253
00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:34.505 line:83%
You're a fucking pussy.

254
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.759 line:83%
What are you gonna do now, huh?

255
00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:40.803 line:83%
You better fucking stop. Stop!

256
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.692 line:83%
Don't make me fucking kill you, man.

257
00:29:01.824 --> 00:29:04.743 line:83%
Please. Please.

258
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.164 line:83%
Please, just let me walk.

259
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:10.833 line:83%
Let me walk. Leave me alive.

260
00:29:14.712 --> 00:29:19.133 line:83%
-Please.
-How many of you are there?

261
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.635 line:83%
-What?
-How many?

262
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:32.938 line:83%
It's just me, man, all right?
It's just fucking me. Just let me go!

263
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:35.774 line:83%
Please let me go.

264
00:29:37.943 --> 00:29:38.986 line:83%
Please.

265
00:29:42.698 --> 00:29:45.326 line:83%
Just let me go.

266
00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:51.540 line:83%
Okay. Okay.

267
00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:53.834 line:83%
Okay.

268
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.669 line:83%
Okay, I swear to God....

269
00:35:25.582 --> 00:35:27.584 line:83%
Rocky, hey, are you okay?

270
00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:29.837 line:83%
Are you okay?

271
00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:33.257 line:83%
Maybe.... Maybe we should
call the cops before he does.

272
00:35:33.423 --> 00:35:35.175 line:83%
We'll come clean--

273
00:35:35.592 --> 00:35:37.177 line:83%
Wait.

274
00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:40.097 line:83%
What?

275
00:36:04.413 --> 00:36:06.248 line:83%
Oh, my God.

276
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.603 line:83%
There's a lot more than 300 grand.
That's got to be about a million dollars.

277
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.148 line:83%
Okay, let's get out of here.

278
00:36:39.156 --> 00:36:42.159 line:83%
The storm cellar door.
The door's bolted from the inside.

279
00:36:42.326 --> 00:36:44.328 line:83%
That could be our way out.

280
00:36:44.995 --> 00:36:46.204 line:83%
Let's go.

281
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:41.004 line:83%
Let's go.

282
00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:46.009 line:83%
This way.

283
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:48.345 line:83%
What?

284
00:39:48.512 --> 00:39:50.889 line:83%
Oh, shit. The phone died.

285
00:39:51.681 --> 00:39:53.517 line:83%
Fuck.

286
00:41:48.548 --> 00:41:50.425 line:83%
-Where's the door?
-I don't know.

287
00:41:50.592 --> 00:41:52.844 line:83%
Where is it? Do you see it?

288
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:32.008 line:83%
We need to get the fuck
out of here right now.

289
00:42:32.592 --> 00:42:37.389 line:83%
Come on. Let's go.
Look, the door's right here.

290
00:42:44.938 --> 00:42:46.690 line:83%
What?

291
00:42:48.233 --> 00:42:49.734 line:83%
Rocky? Rocky.

292
00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:53.405 line:83%
Rocky, listen. Hey, that's our exit.

293
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.408 line:83%
The door's right fucking there.
We can leave right now.

294
00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:05.125 line:83%
She's the one who killed his daughter.

295
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:11.589 line:83%
-We have to get her out of here.
-No, no, no. We don't have time.

296
00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:13.800 line:83%
We'll get out of here,
we'll call the cops...

297
00:43:13.967 --> 00:43:16.136 line:83%
...and then they'll come find her,
all right?

298
00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:02.682 line:83%
The code from the safe upstairs.
You remember it?

299
00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:07.479 line:83%
-2-9-7-8. 7-8, 7-8. 2-9-7-8.
-2-9-7-8.

300
00:44:09.105 --> 00:44:10.774 line:83%
Okay, got them.

301
00:44:14.277 --> 00:44:15.695 line:83%
He's coming.

302
00:44:16.488 --> 00:44:18.406 line:83%
-Hurry up.
-Okay, one more, one more.

303
00:44:18.907 --> 00:44:20.575 line:83%
Fuck, fuck!

304
00:44:20.742 --> 00:44:23.620 line:83%
I almost have it. Almost.... okay.

305
00:44:23.787 --> 00:44:27.040 line:83%
I don't care what you did.
I'll get you out of here.

306
00:44:27.207 --> 00:44:28.249 line:83%
Go. Go!

307
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:43.431 line:83%
-There's the door.
-There it is.

308
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.730 line:83%
You okay? Okay.

309
00:44:57.487 --> 00:44:58.530 line:83%
What's wrong?

310
00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:03.535 line:83%
-What's wrong?
-It's locked.

311
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:06.955 line:83%
You have the keys.
Don't you have the keys?

312
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:09.082 line:83%
Fuck.

313
00:45:09.249 --> 00:45:11.626 line:83%
-One of these should open it.
-Come on.

314
00:45:14.546 --> 00:45:16.214 line:83%
Come on.

315
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:17.424 line:83%
-Come on.
-Okay.

316
00:45:23.555 --> 00:45:25.098 line:83%
Oh, yes.

317
00:45:29.394 --> 00:45:30.728 line:83%
Come on.

318
00:46:28.495 --> 00:46:30.455 line:83%
He shot her.

319
00:47:02.946 --> 00:47:04.864 line:83%
No.

320
00:47:12.038 --> 00:47:13.581 line:83%
No.

321
00:47:14.707 --> 00:47:16.543 line:83%
No.

322
00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:27.011 line:83%
My baby.

323
00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:35.728 line:83%
No!

324
00:47:36.312 --> 00:47:37.522 line:83%
No!

325
00:47:39.274 --> 00:47:41.693 line:83%
No!

326
00:48:23.693 --> 00:48:25.236 line:83%
We have to go back upstairs.

327
00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:27.405 line:83%
Yeah, listen.

328
00:48:27.572 --> 00:48:31.034 line:83%
Listen, okay? These keys, they match
the locks on the front door.

329
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.746 line:83%
All right? If we get up there,
we can get out.

330
00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:36.039 line:83%
Okay?

331
00:48:46.716 --> 00:48:47.842 line:83%
Let's go now.

332
00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:04.984 line:83%
Shit.

333
00:49:23.336 --> 00:49:24.379 line:83%
Alex?

334
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.833 line:83%
Rocky?

335
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:05.438 line:83%
Please don't....

336
00:51:09.442 --> 00:51:10.902 line:83%
No, please.

337
00:51:32.799 --> 00:51:35.510 line:83%
-Rocky?
-Alex. Alex.

338
00:51:36.552 --> 00:51:38.221 line:83%
Rocky, Rocky. Let's go. Let's go.

339
00:51:38.387 --> 00:51:41.933 line:83%
This way. This way, come on.
This way, come on, come on, come on.

340
00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:43.184 line:83%
Okay.

341
00:51:43.351 --> 00:51:45.853 line:83%
Oh, come on. Where am I?

342
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.146 line:83%
Where is it?

343
00:51:47.313 --> 00:51:49.023 line:83%
Light. I see light!

344
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:51.025 line:83%
Come on, come on.

345
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:10.044 line:83%
Don't...

346
00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:12.129 line:83%
...run.

347
00:52:15.633 --> 00:52:17.051 line:83%
Rocky...

348
00:52:19.804 --> 00:52:21.097 line:83%
...go to the door.

349
00:52:22.014 --> 00:52:24.308 line:83%
Try the blue key.

350
00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:26.561 line:83%
-Do it.
-Okay.

351
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:28.938 line:83%
Easy.

352
00:52:29.105 --> 00:52:31.023 line:83%
Easy, buddy.

353
00:52:35.236 --> 00:52:36.696 line:83%
Fuck.

354
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:41.576 line:83%
-Rocky?
-Yeah.

355
00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:45.580 line:83%
-Come on.
-Easy, buddy.

356
00:52:45.746 --> 00:52:46.873 line:83%
Easy.

357
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:50.585 line:83%
It's okay.

358
00:52:51.961 --> 00:52:54.589 line:83%
Okay, that's a good boy. That's good.

359
00:52:55.089 --> 00:52:56.299 line:83%
All right.

360
00:52:56.465 --> 00:52:57.675 line:83%
That's good.

361
00:52:57.842 --> 00:53:01.178 line:83%
That's good. That's good.

362
00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:03.514 line:83%
Fuck.

363
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:06.517 line:83%
Rocky. Run, now. Go, go, go!

364
00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:08.227 line:83%
Upstairs, now. Go. Go, go!

365
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.857 line:83%
Hurry, hurry!

366
00:53:14.066 --> 00:53:16.027 line:83%
Go! There's a door! Come on!

367
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:19.322 line:83%
Let's go.

368
00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:22.617 line:83%
Hey, move this. Come on.

369
00:53:27.955 --> 00:53:29.498 line:83%
Damn.

370
00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:32.501 line:83%
-Are those blocked up too?
-Yeah.

371
00:53:33.502 --> 00:53:34.545 line:83%
We're trapped in here.

372
00:53:56.067 --> 00:53:58.402 line:83%
Rocky, the remote.
Do you have it with you?

373
00:53:58.569 --> 00:54:00.529 line:83%
Come on. Okay.

374
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.156 line:83%
-What are you doing?
-Pressing the panic button.

375
00:54:02.323 --> 00:54:04.367 line:83%
If I get in range,
the system will call 911.

376
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:06.702 line:83%
-The police will come.
-No. We can't go to jail.

377
00:54:06.869 --> 00:54:10.331 line:83%
No. No, we won't. Okay? This is robbery
versus kidnapping and murder.

378
00:54:10.498 --> 00:54:12.833 line:83%
The police won't care about us
or why we were here.

379
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.128 line:83%
-We helped them get this guy.
-But then we wouldn't keep the money.

380
00:54:18.297 --> 00:54:20.299 line:83%
-We need to get out of this room.
-Up there.

381
00:54:25.346 --> 00:54:26.722 line:83%
Go!

382
00:54:35.147 --> 00:54:36.649 line:83%
Alex!

383
00:54:36.816 --> 00:54:38.818 line:83%
What are you doing? Go!

384
00:54:55.167 --> 00:54:56.627 line:83%
No! No, no, no!

385
00:59:52.423 --> 00:59:53.549 line:83%
Hey!

386
01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.530 line:83%
Please, let me go.

387
01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:31.034 line:83%
Please, let me go!

388
01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.206 line:83%
I....

389
01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:37.874 line:83%
I understand you.

390
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.710 line:83%
She killed your daughter.

391
01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:41.378 line:83%
You wanted her to pay.

392
01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:42.546 line:83%
I understand that.

393
01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:44.298 line:83%
I won't tell anyone.

394
01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:47.092 line:83%
You understand nothing.

395
01:04:48.594 --> 01:04:51.346 line:83%
Only a parent could know...

396
01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:55.642 line:83%
...the bond between
a father and his child.

397
01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:01.898 line:83%
She should have gone to prison, but...

398
01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:04.776 line:83%
...rich girls don't go to jail.

399
01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.365 line:83%
None of this is gonna
bring your daughter back.

400
01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:18.957 line:83%
That's not really true.

401
01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:27.466 line:83%
Cindy took my child away from me.

402
01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.219 line:83%
I thought...

403
01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:34.640 line:83%
...it's only fair...

404
01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:39.561 line:83%
...that she give me a new one.

405
01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.901 line:83%
She was pregnant with my baby.

406
01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:51.448 line:83%
You killed them both.

407
01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:53.617 line:83%
-No.
-Well, they would be alive...

408
01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:57.371 line:83%
...if you hadn't broken into my home.

409
01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.874 line:83%
No.

410
01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.385 line:83%
You have to be held accountable.

411
01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.183 line:83%
Please.

412
01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:28.063 line:83%
-Please, God.
-God?

413
01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:31.316 line:83%
There's no God.

414
01:08:33.735 --> 01:08:35.362 line:83%
It's a joke.

415
01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:38.490 line:83%
It's a bad joke.

416
01:08:39.074 --> 01:08:43.286 line:83%
You tell me what God
would allow this.

417
01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:49.501 line:83%
What are you doing?

418
01:08:53.338 --> 01:08:55.841 line:83%
I'm not a rapist.

419
01:08:57.217 --> 01:08:58.969 line:83%
I never forced myself on her.

420
01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:01.805 line:83%
Stop.

421
01:09:02.556 --> 01:09:04.307 line:83%
I promised I would set her free...

422
01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.643 line:83%
...just as soon
as she gave me a child.

423
01:09:13.275 --> 01:09:15.569 line:83%
But now she's gone.

424
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:18.238 line:83%
But I'm done waiting.

425
01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:21.908 line:83%
No. No, no.

426
01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:58.778 line:83%
You can't do this to me.

427
01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.697 line:83%
There's nothing a man cannot do...

428
01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:04.409 line:83%
...once he accepts the fact
that there is no God.

429
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.953 line:83%
No! No!

430
01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.788 line:83%
No, no, no!

431
01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.874 line:83%
No!

432
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:14.544 line:83%
-No!
-You're strong.

433
01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:18.882 line:83%
-You're young.
-No.

434
01:10:19.049 --> 01:10:20.342 line:83%
You'll breed well.

435
01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:22.469 line:83%
No. Get away from me.

436
01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:25.931 line:83%
No! No!

437
01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:28.058 line:83%
No!

438
01:10:30.352 --> 01:10:32.771 line:83%
No.

439
01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:36.399 line:83%
Stop.

440
01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:39.861 line:83%
Nine months...

441
01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:41.947 line:83%
...and I will give you your life back.

442
01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.572 line:83%
Are you okay? Rocky. Okay, yeah.

443
01:11:25.657 --> 01:11:27.325 line:83%
Rocky, did he--? Did he hurt you?

444
01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:29.285 line:83%
Rocky?

445
01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.664 line:83%
You fucking bastard.

446
01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:39.129 line:83%
Fuck you!

447
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:51.057 line:83%
Hey, Rocky. Rocky. Rocky.
Rocky, it's over. Come on.

448
01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:52.892 line:83%
How's that taste?

449
01:11:58.732 --> 01:12:00.984 line:83%
-Now what?
-Come on.

450
01:12:08.575 --> 01:12:11.494 line:83%
You're gonna rot in prison
for what you've done.

451
01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.164 line:83%
Rocky, we can't involve the cops now.

452
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.958 line:83%
If we steal a million in cash,
then lead the cops here...

453
01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:19.711 line:83%
...he'll tell them about us.
Our blood is all over.

454
01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:24.966 line:83%
-They'll get to us in a second.
-You got what you came for.

455
01:12:27.594 --> 01:12:29.637 line:83%
Now take it.

456
01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:32.140 line:83%
Get out of my house!

457
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:37.187 line:83%
Look, he's buying our silence.

458
01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.938 line:83%
He needs us to take the money.

459
01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:41.858 line:83%
It's one or the other.

460
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.237 line:83%
Whatever you choose, I'm with you.

461
01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.791 line:83%
-Okay.
-This one.

462
01:12:58.208 --> 01:12:59.918 line:83%
Let's get out of here.

463
01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:01.544 line:83%
I have to find the key.

464
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:02.879 line:83%
All right.

465
01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:08.093 line:83%
That key won't....

466
01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.053 line:83%
I got it.

467
01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:01.896 line:83%
You're worthless out here.

468
01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:08.153 line:83%
Fuck.

469
01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:16.995 line:83%
Shit!

470
01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:42.830 line:83%
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!

471
01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:44.624 line:83%
Fuck!

472
01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:50.852 line:83%
I'm sorry, Alex.

473
01:18:51.018 --> 01:18:53.187 line:83%
I'm so sorry.

474
01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.435 line:83%
No!

475
01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:35.188 line:83%
Don't!

476
01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:41.360 line:83%
No. No.

477
01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:54.165 line:83%
Don't....

478
01:20:01.756 --> 01:20:02.965 line:83%
No!

479
01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:10.932 line:83%
No.

480
01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:58.372 line:83%
What is that?

481
01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:01.542 line:83%
You and me at the beach.

482
01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:11.510 line:83%
--will be boarding shortly
on Platform 6.

483
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:15.514 line:83%
This house behind me on Buena Vista
