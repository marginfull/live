1
00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:56.333 line:82%
This is London. The world's
greatest city.

2
00:00:58.098 --> 00:00:59.875 line:82%
I've lived here for 22 years.

3
00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:03.117 line:82%
Every morning I walk down
the same street.

4
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.208 line:82%
And every morning, the street
asks who I am.

5
00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:09.917 line:82%
It asks: "Who is Chaudhary
Baldev Singh?

6
00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:12.942 line:82%
Where is he from?
Why is he here?"

7
00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:16.298 line:82%
How should I answer this?

8
00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:22.378 line:82%
I've spent half my life here, yet
this land and I are still strangers.

9
00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:27.462 line:82%
No one knows me here,
except these pigeons.

10
00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.750 line:82%
They're like me.

11
00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:32.750 line:82%
They have no country either.

12
00:01:33.383 --> 00:01:36.792 line:82%
Wherever they spot grain,
they eat it and take flight.

13
00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:41.038 line:82%
When will I be able to fly away?
I don't know.

14
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.292 line:82%
Necessity has clipped my wings.

15
00:01:44.993 --> 00:01:47.042 line:82%
And the need to eat
has chained my feet.

16
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.125 line:82%
But one day, I will definitely
go back to our country.

17
00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:56.083 line:82%
To our Punjab.

18
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.917 line:82%
When you hear the cuckoo's cry,
memories like bullets fly

19
00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:30.861 line:82%
Come home, stranger,
your country calls you

20
00:02:30.944 --> 00:02:35.882 line:82%
Come home, stranger,
your country calls you

21
00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:41.173 line:82%
The season to stroll
in gardens is back

22
00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:46.552 line:82%
Come home, stranger,
your country calls you

23
00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:51.635 line:82%
Come home, stranger,
your country calls you

24
00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:56.735 line:82%
Come home, stranger,
your country calls you

25
00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:53.984 line:82%
The illiterate souls of the
village can't read your letter

26
00:03:54.307 --> 00:04:01.161 line:82%
If you come and kiss the
motherland, then it'll be happy

27
00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:07.074 line:82%
We agree that you have your
dreams, but we're your own

28
00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:12.403 line:82%
You forgetful guy,
we miss you

29
00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:17.543 line:82%
Come home, stranger,
your country calls you

30
00:04:17.627 --> 00:04:22.824 line:82%
Come home, stranger, your
country calls you

31
00:04:22.907 --> 00:04:28.185 line:82%
Come home, stranger, your
country calls you

32
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.948 line:82%
Glory to Goddess Lakshmi!

33
00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:51.125 line:82%
Yes, Lajjo. I got here safely.

34
00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.292 line:82%
OK, I'll hang up.

35
00:05:08.518 --> 00:05:10.500 line:82%
What's so funny this morning,
Chutki?

36
00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:17.530 line:82%
For the past 20 years, Dad's gone
to the same place.

37
00:05:17.613 --> 00:05:22.050 line:82%
But every day you phone and ask:
"Did you get there safely?"

38
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.967 line:82%
You wouldn't understand.
It's a habit.

39
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.035 line:82%
Miss Lucy is right.

40
00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:31.793 line:82%
"If you can't change your habits,
soon they'll become needs."

41
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:36.835 line:82%
More philosophy? Why can't you
talk like a 12-year-old?

42
00:05:37.172 --> 00:05:38.959 line:82%
Why talk like a grown up?

43
00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:42.460 line:82%
Oh, Mom! Childhood and youth
mean nothing.

44
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.257 line:82%
A person's age depends entirely
on how they feel inside.

45
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.581 line:82%
All right, I give up.

46
00:05:50.664 --> 00:05:52.868 line:82%
Go to school and pick
Miss Lucy's brain instead.

47
00:05:53.097 --> 00:05:54.417 line:82%
- Ok?
- Ok, Mom.

48
00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:58.418 line:82%
Why do you forget to eat
your almonds?

49
00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.736 line:82%
What can I do? It's a habit.

50
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.126 line:82%
Bye, Mom.

51
00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:05.500 line:82%
Simran!

52
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.127 line:82%
For the first time in 18 years

53
00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:27.739 line:82%
a complete stranger

54
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.390 line:82%
has come
into my thoughts

55
00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:33.084 line:82%
That's my diary.
Only I can read it.

56
00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:35.252 line:82%
It's so interesting.
Let me read it.

57
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:37.709 line:82%
No way, it's private.

58
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.717 line:82%
Private? For me, too?

59
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.293 line:82%
When a girl grows up, she becomes
her mother's friend, too.

60
00:06:45.303 --> 00:06:46.651 line:82%
You won't tell anyone?

61
00:06:46.992 --> 00:06:48.000 line:82%
Never.

62
00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:49.502 line:82%
- Promise?
- Yes, promise.

63
00:06:50.456 --> 00:06:52.218 line:82%
I'll read and you listen.

64
00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:53.980 line:82%
Alright.

65
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.211 line:82%
For the first time in 18 years

66
00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:11.960 line:82%
a complete stranger comes
into my thoughts.

67
00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.711 line:82%
A shadow flutters past my eyes.

68
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.795 line:82%
Someone taps at my heart's door.

69
00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:27.752 line:82%
His dark deep eyes ask me
to surrender.

70
00:07:29.045 --> 00:07:30.413 line:82%
The lines on my palm

71
00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:32.911 line:82%
turn into his face.

72
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.168 line:82%
His silken breath
caresses my cheeks.

73
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.752 line:82%
The scent of his hands
lingers in my hair.

74
00:07:42.727 --> 00:07:47.460 line:82%
Yes. For the first time in 18 years

75
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:51.905 line:82%
a complete stranger
comes into my thoughts.

76
00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:59.960 line:82%
Simi, I didn't know you were
such a good poet.

77
00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:03.501 line:82%
The boy sounds wonderful.
Who is he?

78
00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:07.418 line:82%
Unknown. Unseen.

79
00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.085 line:82%
You mean he doesn't exist?

80
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.542 line:82%
If you ask me, you can't
find such boys.

81
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.418 line:82%
You're crazy. You don't even know
him, and you dream of him?

82
00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:25.043 line:82%
No, Ma. This isn't a dream.

83
00:08:26.942 --> 00:08:30.501 line:82%
I know I've never met him
or seen him.

84
00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:35.876 line:82%
But he does exist... somewhere.

85
00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:09.125 line:82%
The one who comes into my dreams

86
00:09:09.338 --> 00:09:13.013 line:82%
Taunts me with his presence

87
00:09:13.592 --> 00:09:17.114 line:82%
The one who comes into my dreams

88
00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:21.108 line:82%
Taunts me with his presence

89
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.667 line:82%
Tell him to come before me

90
00:09:25.908 --> 00:09:29.724 line:82%
The one who comes
into my dreams

91
00:09:30.214 --> 00:09:33.722 line:82%
Taunts me with his presence

92
00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:38.180 line:82%
Tell him to come before me

93
00:09:38.374 --> 00:09:43.049 line:82%
The one who comes
into my dreams

94
00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:17.542 line:82%
What does he look like?
Where he is now?

95
00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:25.997 line:82%
What does he look like?
Where he is now?

96
00:10:26.387 --> 00:10:30.155 line:82%
My lips say yes to him

97
00:10:30.598 --> 00:10:33.338 line:82%
Is he known to me
or is he a stranger?

98
00:10:34.795 --> 00:10:38.475 line:82%
Is he real or a figment of my
imagination?

99
00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:42.746 line:82%
He looks at me from afar

100
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.268 line:82%
Tell him not to steal the sleep
from my eyes

101
00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:51.146 line:82%
The one who comes into my dreams

102
00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:55.232 line:82%
Taunts me with his presence

103
00:10:55.532 --> 00:10:59.745 line:82%
Tell him to come before me

104
00:10:59.828 --> 00:11:05.228 line:82%
The one who comes
into my dreams

105
00:11:30.928 --> 00:11:34.801 line:82%
I feel a spell sweep over me

106
00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:47.148 line:82%
What can I do?
My heart quickens

107
00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:51.163 line:82%
My heart says it's crazy
about you

108
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.543 line:82%
Why does he hide from me?

109
00:11:56.157 --> 00:12:00.104 line:82%
Mistakenly he brought me
flowers

110
00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:04.130 line:82%
Tell him to bring me
the moon instead

111
00:12:04.426 --> 00:12:08.308 line:82%
The one who comes
into my dreams

112
00:12:08.544 --> 00:12:12.346 line:82%
Taunts me with his presence

113
00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:16.605 line:82%
The one who comes
into my dreams

114
00:12:16.907 --> 00:12:20.625 line:82%
Taunts me with his presence

115
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:25.043 line:82%
Tell him to come before me

116
00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:54.253 line:82%
Party all night, never sleep.

117
00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:55.791 line:82%
How can you wake up,
if you never sleep?

118
00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:59.292 line:82%
You're late for the graduation
ceremony. Hurry.

119
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.545 line:82%
Is it a holiday?

120
00:13:13.557 --> 00:13:16.297 line:82%
Fancy being late for graduation,
Raj!

121
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.253 line:82%
No choice. Last night...

122
00:13:21.057 --> 00:13:22.916 line:82%
What's with him?
Has he been drinking?

123
00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:28.336 line:82%
Apparently someone's failed,
It'll be announced in public.

124
00:13:32.848 --> 00:13:34.472 line:82%
- Best of luck.
- Oh, God!

125
00:13:34.555 --> 00:13:37.695 line:82%
Listen, best of luck.

126
00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:41.857 line:82%
And for the first time in the history
of this university

127
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:46.192 line:82%
we have a failure.
Raj Malhotra.

128
00:13:56.162 --> 00:13:59.799 line:82%
I'm proud of you, my son.
I'm really proud of you!

129
00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:03.586 line:82%
Son, you've brought honor to me,
Dharam Veer Malhotra.

130
00:14:06.531 --> 00:14:08.753 line:82%
You didn't hear it right, Pops.

131
00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:12.201 line:82%
I knew you'd make my name shine.

132
00:14:12.544 --> 00:14:16.044 line:82%
The whole family is proud
of you today.

133
00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:18.628 line:82%
See how they smile on you.

134
00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:23.378 line:82%
Your great-grandfather, Diwan Brijnath,
never went to school.

135
00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:28.710 line:82%
My grandfather, Diwan Dwarkanath,
failed fourth grade.

136
00:14:29.472 --> 00:14:33.741 line:82%
My father, Diwan Pushkarnath,
failed eighth grade.

137
00:14:33.952 --> 00:14:36.328 line:82%
And I, your father,
failed matriculation.

138
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.402 line:82%
Failing is a tradition
in our family.

139
00:14:40.602 --> 00:14:45.026 line:82%
Glad you respect this tradition.
But you did even better.

140
00:14:45.109 --> 00:14:48.545 line:82%
We all failed in India.
You failed in London.

141
00:14:52.956 --> 00:14:54.082 line:82%
Pops, are you really happy?

142
00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:55.833 line:82%
Happy? I'm delighted.

143
00:14:55.916 --> 00:15:00.721 line:82%
Studying is pointless.
Doesn't fill your pockets.

144
00:15:00.804 --> 00:15:03.600 line:82%
Take me. I was illiterate
when I left Bhatinda.

145
00:15:03.683 --> 00:15:05.793 line:82%
Now I'm a London millionaire.

146
00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:07.335 line:82%
- Yo, Pops.
- Thank you.

147
00:15:07.418 --> 00:15:09.210 line:82%
Everything happens for the best.

148
00:15:09.293 --> 00:15:11.128 line:82%
Tomorrow you can start
at the office.

149
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.370 line:82%
- The office, Pops?
- Today, if you like.

150
00:15:13.453 --> 00:15:15.917 line:82%
- Not tomorrow either.
- Why not?

151
00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:21.378 line:82%
Pops! You're a man of experience.
You know how hard it is to fail.

152
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.353 line:82%
I've been working so hard at it,
I need rest.

153
00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:29.132 line:82%
Say a long holiday
in Europe. Cheers!

154
00:15:29.215 --> 00:15:32.750 line:82%
- A holiday. How long?
- A month or so.

155
00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:37.209 line:82%
A month or so? Hold this
and turn around.

156
00:15:37.292 --> 00:15:39.836 line:82%
- Surprise present, Pops?
- Yes, surprise.

157
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.961 line:82%
Moron! Is this what I deserve?

158
00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.042 line:82%
Don't break that.

159
00:16:02.903 --> 00:16:04.608 line:82%
You OK, Pops?

160
00:16:10.495 --> 00:16:14.500 line:82%
You're right, Pops. I should
take care of your business.

161
00:16:14.897 --> 00:16:18.661 line:82%
- You're getting old now.
- The hell I am!

162
00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:20.734 line:82%
Exactly, Pops.

163
00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:22.930 line:82%
- Continue...
- Yes.

164
00:16:23.013 --> 00:16:25.966 line:82%
I've decided. No Europe. I'll start
work tomorrow.

165
00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:29.669 line:82%
In this house only your father
makes decisions.

166
00:16:30.036 --> 00:16:33.150 line:82%
I've made up my mind.
You'll go to Europe.

167
00:16:33.233 --> 00:16:37.961 line:82%
No, Pops. I've had it too easy.
My days of youth are over.

168
00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:42.152 line:82%
Never say they're over.

169
00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:47.818 line:82%
I've slogged all my life so you
could do...

170
00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:51.378 line:82%
whatever I couldn't.

171
00:16:54.721 --> 00:16:58.003 line:82%
I never knew when my youth
came or went.

172
00:16:59.473 --> 00:17:04.377 line:82%
But I didn't mind. I knew my son
would enjoy youth for me.

173
00:17:05.577 --> 00:17:08.961 line:82%
If you think you've had
enough fun

174
00:17:09.963 --> 00:17:13.753 line:82%
and the days of youth
are behind you, never mind.

175
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.325 line:82%
Go to Europe. Live my youth
for me.

176
00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:21.169 line:82%
Pops...

177
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.336 line:82%
you'e the greatest.

178
00:17:27.542 --> 00:17:30.544 line:82%
- You are also ok.
- Thank you.

179
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.252 line:82%
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

180
00:17:36.208 --> 00:17:37.250 line:82%
I love you.

181
00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:39.671 line:82%
Thank you.

182
00:17:43.209 --> 00:17:44.333 line:82%
Ajit's letter!

183
00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:53.998 line:82%
Lajjo! Look what's here.

184
00:17:54.132 --> 00:17:55.990 line:82%
A letter from my friend.

185
00:17:56.073 --> 00:17:58.958 line:82%
- Alright.
- From Ajit.

186
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:01.462 line:82%
Go on, smell it.

187
00:18:03.379 --> 00:18:05.107 line:82%
The fragrance of Punjab!

188
00:18:05.368 --> 00:18:06.376 line:82%
It indeed is.

189
00:18:06.472 --> 00:18:09.294 line:82%
The smell of mustard spinach
and cornbread.

190
00:18:09.377 --> 00:18:11.846 line:82%
Long kurtas, short pants.

191
00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:14.598 line:82%
- Cornbread, mustard spinach!
- Oh, God!

192
00:18:14.681 --> 00:18:16.125 line:82%
My dear friend Baldev,

193
00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:18.416 line:82%
we are all well.

194
00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:22.960 line:82%
We pray to God that you and
your family are well too.

195
00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.834 line:82%
You'll be pleased to hear
my son Kuljit has got his BA.

196
00:18:26.917 --> 00:18:29.252 line:82%
He is now working with me.

197
00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:34.711 line:82%
The time has come for our
friendship to turn to kinship.

198
00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:39.044 line:82%
The promise we made 20 years ago
must be fulfilled now.

199
00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:43.961 line:82%
You must come home so Kuljit
and Simran can be married...

200
00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:46.586 line:82%
Go on.

201
00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:53.625 line:82%
She's feeling shy.

202
00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:58.377 line:82%
See, Lajjo? That's our upbringing.
Our culture.

203
00:18:58.733 --> 00:19:01.545 line:82%
My daughter still feels shy
in front of her father.

204
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.294 line:82%
This means I haven't failed

205
00:19:04.583 --> 00:19:09.077 line:82%
to keep the soul of India
alive while in London.

206
00:19:09.608 --> 00:19:14.252 line:82%
Our daughter is engaged. Don't just
stand there. Let's celebrate.

207
00:19:15.102 --> 00:19:17.859 line:82%
- Chutki, I'm so happy.
- Can I say one thing?

208
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.731 line:82%
Not one, you can say four.

209
00:19:21.292 --> 00:19:23.854 line:82%
Shouldn't you consult Simran?

210
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.773 line:82%
She's known since childhood
she was engaged to Kuljit.

211
00:19:28.982 --> 00:19:32.279 line:82%
She may have known, but
after all these years...

212
00:19:32.542 --> 00:19:33.833 line:82%
Don't you worry.

213
00:19:34.167 --> 00:19:39.211 line:82%
Simran will be so happy.
You'll have to cast off the evil eye.

214
00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:42.461 line:82%
I'll write to Ajit tomorrow.

215
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.044 line:82%
Oh, Lord! The day has
finally come.

216
00:20:00.875 --> 00:20:02.710 line:82%
What are you doing, Simran?

217
00:20:05.708 --> 00:20:10.003 line:82%
I forgot, Ma. I have no right
to dream.

218
00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:14.711 line:82%
No, child. Dream away.
You must dream.

219
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.711 line:82%
Just don't count on
dreams coming true.

220
00:20:20.792 --> 00:20:24.252 line:82%
Who knows? Kuljit may be
your dream.

221
00:20:26.167 --> 00:20:29.559 line:82%
I've booked the tickets and you're
coming to Europe with me.

222
00:20:29.642 --> 00:20:30.833 line:82%
- I can't.
- Shut up!

223
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.127 line:82%
Father won't let me out alone.

224
00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:37.843 line:82%
Think he'll let me go to Europe
for a month? It's just impossible.

225
00:20:38.765 --> 00:20:41.377 line:82%
Daddy won't let me.
I have lots of work.

226
00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:45.553 line:82%
Have you learned nothing from me?
Can't you make an excuse? Idiot!

227
00:20:45.785 --> 00:20:49.709 line:82%
I could make an excuse.
But I don't want to lie to Dad.

228
00:20:49.792 --> 00:20:50.875 line:82%
I don't care.

229
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.917 line:82%
Dolly and Payal are coming, too.

230
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.836 line:82%
There's no way out, you have
to come.

231
00:20:58.167 --> 00:21:02.060 line:82%
- OK, I'll talk to Ma tonight
- Ok.

232
00:21:02.376 --> 00:21:03.376 line:82%
Europe?

233
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.145 line:82%
- With friends?
- Yes.

234
00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:09.586 line:82%
- For a month?
- Yes.

235
00:21:10.292 --> 00:21:11.292 line:82%
Very good.

236
00:21:12.457 --> 00:21:16.961 line:82%
Chutki, call the doctor. Tell him
our Simran has gone mad.

237
00:21:18.794 --> 00:21:19.835 line:82%
Mom...

238
00:21:20.222 --> 00:21:21.625 line:82%
Look at this.

239
00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:25.711 line:82%
Crazy! You talk of going to Europe?

240
00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:28.176 line:82%
If your father hears, he'll tear
the house down.

241
00:21:28.471 --> 00:21:30.792 line:82%
Girls shouldn't travel alone.

242
00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:36.226 line:82%
Mom! I won't be alone. My girlfriends
are going, too.

243
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.250 line:82%
No point talking to me.
Even if I agreed...

244
00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:44.003 line:82%
it's your father who decides.
Ask him tonight.

245
00:21:47.155 --> 00:21:50.483 line:82%
God, please put father
in a good mood.

246
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.961 line:82%
Uncle, can I have some beer?

247
00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:10.294 line:82%
Sorry, it's closing time.
Come tomorrow.

248
00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:13.042 line:82%
Come on Uncle, it's just beer.
It's over there.

249
00:22:14.418 --> 00:22:17.958 line:82%
Didn't I say that the store
is closed? Out you go.

250
00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:21.199 line:82%
- Ok... - Relax, take it easy.
- Out! ... - Idiot!

251
00:22:24.167 --> 00:22:26.292 line:82%
- Got the beer?
- No.

252
00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:30.003 line:82%
- You couldn't even do that?
- Uncle is the jumpy type.

253
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.325 line:82%
- I'll go.
- You won't get it...

254
00:22:32.408 --> 00:22:34.041 line:82%
...Duffer!

255
00:22:37.417 --> 00:22:38.455 line:82%
Excuse me, sir.

256
00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:40.712 line:82%
Yes.

257
00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:43.763 line:82%
- Can I buy some aspirin?
- We're closed.

258
00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:45.176 line:82%
Sir, please.

259
00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:48.045 line:82%
Sir, I have a splitting
headache. My sinuses.

260
00:22:48.128 --> 00:22:49.461 line:82%
I'll faint without an aspirin.

261
00:22:49.544 --> 00:22:53.044 line:82%
All the shops are closed.
One aspirin.

262
00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:57.670 line:82%
Only an Indian can help
another Indian.

263
00:23:11.042 --> 00:23:12.448 line:82%
Glory to the Goddess!

264
00:23:12.531 --> 00:23:16.642 line:82%
- Here you go.
- Thank you, very much, sir. Here.

265
00:23:17.532 --> 00:23:22.756 line:82%
Sir, I feel terrible to make you
open the store just for this...

266
00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:25.088 line:82%
No, no, sir! Please.

267
00:23:25.542 --> 00:23:28.420 line:82%
Can I buy something else? Please!

268
00:23:28.827 --> 00:23:30.728 line:82%
I love...

269
00:23:32.888 --> 00:23:34.042 line:82%
I'll take the beer.

270
00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:38.167 line:82%
It's not for me. But my mates
outside, they drink.

271
00:23:38.924 --> 00:23:40.679 line:82%
- Thank you, sir.
- Put it down.

272
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.434 line:82%
Why, sir?

273
00:23:42.757 --> 00:23:45.809 line:82%
Stop play-acting.
Leave that alone.

274
00:23:45.892 --> 00:23:48.990 line:82%
Don't get angry.
You benefit.

275
00:23:49.073 --> 00:23:54.229 line:82%
- Put it down, or I'll...
- Wait. No umbrellas! Control yourself.

276
00:23:55.253 --> 00:23:59.336 line:82%
Here's an extra pound.
Take two. OK?

277
00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:04.836 line:82%
You shameless boy! Do you call
yourself an Indian?

278
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.628 line:82%
People like you give India
a bad name. You liar!

279
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.085 line:82%
Get out of here! Out!

280
00:24:14.167 --> 00:24:16.711 line:82%
OK, I'll go. I'll just take this...

281
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.417 line:82%
Keep the change. Thank you, Uncle.
Bye, good night, see you.

282
00:24:27.017 --> 00:24:29.930 line:82%
Rocky, get the car.

283
00:24:30.013 --> 00:24:31.911 line:82%
- Run, run! Start the car!
- Catch

284
00:24:31.994 --> 00:24:35.674 line:82%
Let's go! Let's get out of here!

285
00:24:58.042 --> 00:24:59.188 line:82%
Father!

286
00:25:11.417 --> 00:25:13.628 line:82%
What's wrong? You're late today.

287
00:25:14.125 --> 00:25:18.752 line:82%
Some insolent, shameless fellow.
Calling himself an Indian.

288
00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:21.669 line:82%
A disgrace to our country.

289
00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:25.294 line:82%
Scoundrels like him should
drown.

290
00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:27.461 line:82%
No shame, no manners.

291
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:30.377 line:82%
No respect for their elders.

292
00:25:31.042 --> 00:25:32.395 line:82%
You fought with someone?

293
00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:35.919 line:82%
Some shameless fellow
wanted to buy beer.

294
00:25:36.273 --> 00:25:39.599 line:82%
I said the store was closed
but he ran off with it.

295
00:25:39.848 --> 00:25:43.544 line:82%
He even broke the statue
of Lakshmi. The rascal!

296
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.378 line:82%
You should be glad you and our
daughters aren't anglicized.

297
00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:53.128 line:82%
Then they'd be neither one thing,
nor the other.

298
00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:55.252 line:82%
Forget those horrible people.

299
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.669 line:82%
Miss Lucy is right.

300
00:26:00.752 --> 00:26:05.044 line:82%
"Never sail in stormy weather,
or you might drown."

301
00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:07.210 line:82%
Sorry.

302
00:26:11.375 --> 00:26:15.246 line:82%
Victory to Vishnu,
Lord of the Universe.

303
00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:18.961 line:82%
Victory to Vishnu,
Lord of the Universe.

304
00:26:19.792 --> 00:26:26.420 line:82%
He who takes away all sorrow from
His devotees.

305
00:26:57.542 --> 00:27:02.503 line:82%
When we came here, you were
that little. Now look at you.

306
00:27:02.874 --> 00:27:07.044 line:82%
They say when a daughter grows up,
her father's shoulders droop.

307
00:27:07.618 --> 00:27:09.124 line:82%
But with a daughter like you

308
00:27:09.207 --> 00:27:13.877 line:82%
my shoulders do not droop,
but my chest swells with pride.

309
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.919 line:82%
My beautiful daughter.

310
00:27:23.182 --> 00:27:28.003 line:82%
- May I ask you something?
- Ask anything you want, child.

311
00:27:29.785 --> 00:27:33.003 line:82%
Father, I'd like to see Europe.

312
00:27:39.313 --> 00:27:43.254 line:82%
I can get a month's Eurail pass.
All my friends are going.

313
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.378 line:82%
Don't be angry, Father.

314
00:27:51.908 --> 00:27:54.503 line:82%
I have never disobeyed you.

315
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.086 line:82%
I'm soon going to a country
I've never seen.

316
00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:05.169 line:82%
To marry a man
I've never met.

317
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.336 line:82%
But I'm not complaining.

318
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.003 line:82%
I know you want what's
best for me.

319
00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:16.211 line:82%
But, Father, I'll never get
another chance like this.

320
00:28:18.232 --> 00:28:20.253 line:82%
I may not come back from India.

321
00:28:21.293 --> 00:28:23.586 line:82%
I may never see my friends again.

322
00:28:24.292 --> 00:28:26.794 line:82%
It's only a month, Father.

323
00:28:27.708 --> 00:28:30.988 line:82%
In that month, I could live
an entire life.

324
00:28:34.085 --> 00:28:35.794 line:82%
To make me happy

325
00:28:36.292 --> 00:28:39.764 line:82%
can't you spare me a month
of my own life?

326
00:28:43.625 --> 00:28:46.880 line:82%
Please, Father. Give me one month.

327
00:28:58.815 --> 00:29:02.436 line:82%
Go. Live your life.

328
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.342 line:82%
Thank you, Dad!

329
00:29:07.263 --> 00:29:08.500 line:82%
My child.

330
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.250 line:82%
Where's Simran?

331
00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:13.975 line:82%
- She's never late.
- That's true.

332
00:29:14.058 --> 00:29:16.918 line:82%
I hope she didn't slip
in the bathroom.

333
00:29:17.001 --> 00:29:18.001 line:82%
Shut up!

334
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.127 line:82%
Didn't I tell you to wake Raj?
Well, did you?

335
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.560 line:82%
Shit!

336
00:30:12.617 --> 00:30:16.252 line:82%
Open the door, darling.

337
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.419 line:82%
Open sesame!

338
00:30:22.875 --> 00:30:24.563 line:82%
Do you have the key?

339
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.752 line:82%
Just joking.
I'll try again.

340
00:30:31.542 --> 00:30:33.919 line:82%
Hello! Anyone there?
Anyone in?

341
00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:39.086 line:82%
No one at home. Hi!

342
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:55.167 line:82%
Excuse me.

343
00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.625 line:82%
I thought so.

344
00:31:06.638 --> 00:31:10.711 line:82%
You and me locked
in a compartment.

345
00:31:34.958 --> 00:31:38.252 line:82%
Haven't I... seen you before?

346
00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:42.085 line:82%
At Robbie's party!

347
00:31:43.057 --> 00:31:46.933 line:82%
- I don't go to parties.
- Good. Me neither.

348
00:31:47.016 --> 00:31:48.669 line:82%
I don't like them at all.

349
00:32:01.583 --> 00:32:03.919 line:82%
You know, your eyes...

350
00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:07.086 line:82%
What about them?

351
00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:11.544 line:82%
- They remind me of someone.
- Who?

352
00:32:12.416 --> 00:32:13.460 line:82%
My grandmother.

353
00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:19.105 line:82%
Your eyes are a little blue,
a little yellow. Just like hers.

354
00:32:19.188 --> 00:32:21.877 line:82%
Please leave me alone.

355
00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:25.252 line:82%
Ok, I don't mind. I mean,
it's all right with me.

356
00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:39.500 line:82%
Keep reading. I was wondering
how you can read upside down.

357
00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:40.862 line:82%
Very interesting style!

358
00:32:41.368 --> 00:32:42.417 line:82%
That's enough.

359
00:32:43.749 --> 00:32:45.543 line:82%
Simran, you're here!

360
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:52.253 line:82%
- I thought you'd missed the train.
- No, I got on.

361
00:32:52.628 --> 00:32:54.125 line:82%
I was worried.

362
00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:56.835 line:82%
- What's your name?
- Sheena.

363
00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:59.419 line:82%
Sheena, I'm here.

364
00:32:59.838 --> 00:33:02.003 line:82%
- Let's go.
- What's the hurry?

365
00:33:02.583 --> 00:33:03.669 line:82%
Allow me.

366
00:33:05.624 --> 00:33:07.211 line:82%
- Bye.
- Bye.

367
00:33:14.417 --> 00:33:16.045 line:82%
I hate girls.

368
00:33:17.167 --> 00:33:19.836 line:82%
Pump it up. You can do
better than that.

369
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.294 line:82%
- Where were you, Raj?
- As usual, a girl stopped me.

370
00:33:25.624 --> 00:33:29.587 line:82%
I helped her onto the train,
and she fell in love with me.

371
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.086 line:82%
He was so boring.

372
00:33:32.337 --> 00:33:37.313 line:82%
He sees me alone and starts
flirting. "I've seen you somewhere."

373
00:33:37.526 --> 00:33:39.377 line:82%
She came closer and closer.

374
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:44.002 line:82%
I got scared. Such a tiny place,
just her and me. No escape.

375
00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:47.418 line:82%
She got lost in my eyes.

376
00:33:48.377 --> 00:33:53.721 line:82%
He went on and on about my eyes.
I tell you, boys today!

377
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:57.237 line:82%
Girls today! I saved my honor
and ran.

378
00:33:57.442 --> 00:34:00.127 line:82%
- What's that?
- A party invite.

379
00:34:00.417 --> 00:34:04.010 line:82%
Eurail cordially invites you to
dinner and dancing in Paris.

380
00:34:04.093 --> 00:34:06.001 line:82%
In Paris, wow!

381
00:34:06.167 --> 00:34:09.669 line:82%
There'll be singing, there'll be
music, there'll be dancing.

382
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.419 line:82%
And boys!

383
00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:26.877 line:82%
Oh, God! This party is so boring.

384
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.910 line:82%
I told you this party
would be boring.

385
00:34:29.993 --> 00:34:33.902 line:82%
You also said the train
would crash.

386
00:34:33.985 --> 00:34:37.127 line:82%
There'd be a fire
and we'd all die.

387
00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:39.169 line:82%
Look! Boys.

388
00:34:43.054 --> 00:34:44.958 line:82%
Oh, God. It's that guy!

389
00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:46.250 line:82%
He's so cute!

390
00:34:46.763 --> 00:34:50.074 line:82%
Where the hell are we?
Your big idea!

391
00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:56.794 line:82%
Is she calling us, or the waiter?

392
00:34:57.273 --> 00:35:00.794 line:82%
No, me. Rocky, stop gawking.

393
00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:04.709 line:82%
Why call him?

394
00:35:04.792 --> 00:35:06.669 line:82%
Come on, Simran, grow up.

395
00:35:10.428 --> 00:35:12.443 line:82%
- Why don't you join us?
- No, actually...

396
00:35:12.863 --> 00:35:13.865 line:82%
Sure.

397
00:35:18.125 --> 00:35:22.210 line:82%
You know, Sheena? I've a feeling
I've seen you somewhere.

398
00:35:22.817 --> 00:35:27.335 line:82%
- Me? Where's that?
- At Robbie's party.

399
00:35:28.982 --> 00:35:31.918 line:82%
Maybe. I go to so many parties.

400
00:35:35.107 --> 00:35:36.752 line:82%
- Know something?
- What?

401
00:35:37.617 --> 00:35:40.084 line:82%
Your eyes remind me of someone.

402
00:35:40.292 --> 00:35:42.043 line:82%
My eyes, really?

403
00:35:42.367 --> 00:35:44.990 line:82%
- Who?
- My grandmother.

404
00:35:45.073 --> 00:35:47.542 line:82%
- Oh! How sweet.
- Thank you.

405
00:35:50.083 --> 00:35:51.875 line:82%
This music is so boring.

406
00:35:51.958 --> 00:35:55.336 line:82%
Yeah, I don't know whether
she's singing or crying.

407
00:35:55.959 --> 00:35:59.667 line:82%
- I play the piano much better.
- You play the piano?

408
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.941 line:82%
I love the piano.

409
00:36:02.024 --> 00:36:03.377 line:82%
I was born on a piano.

410
00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:06.860 line:82%
I've been playing since
I was a kid.

411
00:36:06.943 --> 00:36:08.085 line:82%
- Really?
- Yeah.

412
00:36:09.085 --> 00:36:11.210 line:82%
I have a strange magic
in my fingers.

413
00:36:11.408 --> 00:36:15.586 line:82%
When they land on the keyboard,
the piano plays of its own accord.

414
00:36:17.352 --> 00:36:18.394 line:82%
Lovely fingers.

415
00:36:18.477 --> 00:36:19.752 line:82%
- Thank you.
- May I?

416
00:36:22.293 --> 00:36:25.336 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention please?

417
00:36:25.708 --> 00:36:27.377 line:82%
That voice sounds familiar.

418
00:36:27.958 --> 00:36:31.086 line:82%
We have amongst us tonight
a very great piano player.

419
00:36:31.583 --> 00:36:33.794 line:82%
And he would like to play
something for us.

420
00:36:34.107 --> 00:36:36.877 line:82%
Please welcome... Mr. Raj.

421
00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:47.876 line:82%
Thank you.

422
00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:00.002 line:82%
You shouldn't have done that.

423
00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:02.752 line:82%
Why? Your fingers have magic.

424
00:37:03.458 --> 00:37:06.670 line:82%
When they land on the keyboard,
the piano plays of its own accord.

425
00:37:08.542 --> 00:37:09.708 line:82%
Best of luck!

426
00:37:12.333 --> 00:37:13.625 line:82%
I hate girls.

427
00:39:57.833 --> 00:40:01.950 line:82%
Stop, my crazy heart!
Let me first find out

428
00:40:02.033 --> 00:40:05.212 line:82%
Stop, my crazy heart!
Let me first find out

429
00:40:06.917 --> 00:40:10.462 line:82%
Is she a woman
or is she magic?

430
00:40:11.458 --> 00:40:13.836 line:82%
A fine perfume or
pure intoxication?

431
00:40:34.042 --> 00:40:38.347 line:82%
If she comes near,
let me touch her and see

432
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.978 line:82%
When she looks this way,
smiling unknowingly

433
00:41:26.061 --> 00:41:30.280 line:82%
I stand here clutching
my heart

434
00:41:30.513 --> 00:41:32.068 line:82%
A faraway look

435
00:41:32.834 --> 00:41:35.051 line:82%
in her eyes

436
00:41:35.134 --> 00:41:38.578 line:82%
Many complaints on her lips

437
00:41:39.543 --> 00:41:41.328 line:82%
Do I have a chance with her?

438
00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:43.868 line:82%
Shall I try my luck?

439
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:51.018 line:82%
Stop, my crazy heart!
Let me first find out

440
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.380 line:82%
You're not the only
pretty girl around

441
00:42:31.627 --> 00:42:36.047 line:82%
So why do you turn your back
on me?

442
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:40.651 line:82%
The girl my heart has fallen for

443
00:42:40.734 --> 00:42:44.851 line:82%
is a friend of yours.

444
00:42:45.117 --> 00:42:49.739 line:82%
If she says the word,
I'll take her into my arms

445
00:42:49.822 --> 00:42:53.824 line:82%
Stop, my crazy heart!
Let me first find out

446
00:42:53.907 --> 00:42:57.990 line:82%
Stop, my crazy heart!
Let me first find out

447
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.874 line:82%
You're not the only
pretty girl around

448
00:43:02.957 --> 00:43:07.333 line:82%
You're not the only
pretty girl around

449
00:43:07.828 --> 00:43:12.065 line:82%
So why do you turn your back
on me?

450
00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:07.003 line:82%
I'm very sorry about last night.

451
00:44:09.083 --> 00:44:13.211 line:82%
I really misbehaved with you.

452
00:44:18.933 --> 00:44:20.004 line:82%
I am sorry.

453
00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:31.460 line:82%
I am really very sorry.

454
00:44:32.598 --> 00:44:34.503 line:82%
- It's ok.
- Thank you.

455
00:44:40.083 --> 00:44:42.961 line:82%
- Can I say one more thing?
- What?

456
00:44:56.492 --> 00:44:58.337 line:82%
- This one?
- It's very good.

457
00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.090 line:82%
- All right and this one?

458
00:45:02.173 --> 00:45:05.017 line:82%
- Very good.
- Ok, and this one?

459
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.949 line:82%
- How much is this cowbell?
- 18 francs.

460
00:45:07.032 --> 00:45:09.210 line:82%
Excuse me, I came here before her.

461
00:45:09.293 --> 00:45:10.625 line:82%
I'll buy first.

462
00:45:10.982 --> 00:45:13.960 line:82%
- I'll take this one. How much?
- 12 francs.

463
00:45:14.868 --> 00:45:18.294 line:82%
- Hurry, we'll miss the train
- Where's my money?

464
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.042 line:82%
- Here they are...
- Hurry up.

465
00:45:22.125 --> 00:45:25.128 line:82%
I don't understand
the local money.

466
00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:30.909 line:82%
Just a minute. How much is that?
2, 4, 8?

467
00:45:30.992 --> 00:45:32.711 line:82%
I don't know, keep the change.

468
00:45:34.495 --> 00:45:36.099 line:82%
- Do you want this knife?
- No.

469
00:45:46.357 --> 00:45:47.878 line:82%
The train is gone?

470
00:45:56.941 --> 00:45:59.127 line:82%
Senorita, don't cry.

471
00:46:02.498 --> 00:46:04.665 line:82%
Good girl, Thank you.

472
00:46:05.672 --> 00:46:06.835 line:82%
You've gone quiet.

473
00:46:09.027 --> 00:46:10.972 line:82%
It's raining. Don't cry.

474
00:46:11.055 --> 00:46:12.919 line:82%
Aren't I here?

475
00:46:14.752 --> 00:46:16.670 line:82%
OK! I'm gone!

476
00:46:22.817 --> 00:46:26.586 line:82%
Excuse me, when is the next train
to Zurich?

477
00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:30.462 line:82%
The next train to Zurich will leave
at 8:00 in the evening.

478
00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.292 line:82%
The next train is not for hours.

479
00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:43.586 line:82%
So we'll catch a train from Zurich.

480
00:46:44.667 --> 00:46:47.285 line:82%
Or we could take a bus
or rent a car.

481
00:46:47.368 --> 00:46:50.545 line:82%
Which would you prefer? A bus
or car? Where is she?

482
00:46:54.625 --> 00:46:56.875 line:82%
You've been a pest from
the moment we met.

483
00:46:56.957 --> 00:46:58.002 line:82%
What?

484
00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:00.836 line:82%
Getting on my nerves
from the start.

485
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.861 line:82%
You invite endless trouble.

486
00:47:04.088 --> 00:47:06.545 line:82%
Now we've missed the train,
thanks to you.

487
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.210 line:82%
I want to get to Zurich
in one piece.

488
00:47:09.583 --> 00:47:12.315 line:82%
So I suggest you go your way
and I'll go my way.

489
00:47:12.398 --> 00:47:13.470 line:82%
Ok? Thank you.

490
00:47:13.553 --> 00:47:17.875 line:82%
We're heading for the same place,
catching the same train.

491
00:47:17.958 --> 00:47:19.625 line:82%
So why split up now?

492
00:47:19.708 --> 00:47:23.667 line:82%
Senorita, you really need a guy
like me.

493
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:28.586 line:82%
You're wrong there. A girl like me
doesn't need a guy like you.

494
00:47:28.875 --> 00:47:31.461 line:82%
Now please, stop following me.

495
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.794 line:82%
Keep your distance.

496
00:47:44.208 --> 00:47:48.167 line:82%
I have a needle and thread.
I'll buy you a new dress.

497
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:49.794 line:82%
- I am sorry, Senorita.
- Go!

498
00:48:19.775 --> 00:48:20.913 line:82%
- Hello.
- Hello.

499
00:48:20.996 --> 00:48:22.806 line:82%
Can I see your passport, please?

500
00:48:23.292 --> 00:48:28.418 line:82%
I don't have my passport.
I kind of left it behind on the train.

501
00:48:28.542 --> 00:48:30.679 line:82%
No, you don't understand,
I was on a train.

502
00:48:30.762 --> 00:48:33.889 line:82%
I missed my train.
I was on Eurorail, Paris, Rome.

503
00:48:33.972 --> 00:48:35.519 line:82%
You have to come with us
to the station.

504
00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:38.920 line:82%
- Please sit inside.
- You don't understand.

505
00:48:39.128 --> 00:48:42.748 line:82%
I was on a train, I missed my train.
It's not my fault.

506
00:48:42.831 --> 00:48:45.379 line:82%
My passport, my luggage, everything
is left over there. What can I do?

507
00:48:45.462 --> 00:48:46.832 line:82%
It's not my fault!

508
00:48:47.042 --> 00:48:50.992 line:82%
Oh, darling! My sweetheart!

509
00:48:51.775 --> 00:48:54.927 line:82%
My honey, my sugar, my baby!
I missed yous so much!

510
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:59.197 line:82%
Thank you, officer.

511
00:49:00.042 --> 00:49:03.961 line:82%
Passport. I'm Raj Malhotra,
she's Mrs. Raj Malhotra.

512
00:49:04.874 --> 00:49:07.169 line:82%
What a pain!

513
00:49:07.794 --> 00:49:09.085 line:82%
Thank you very much.

514
00:49:13.167 --> 00:49:14.627 line:82%
My baby.

515
00:49:26.625 --> 00:49:27.625 line:82%
Don't you dare!

516
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.000 line:82%
What the bloody hell do you think
of yourself anyway?

517
00:49:30.083 --> 00:49:32.833 line:82%
I told you not to follow me.
Who do you think you are?

518
00:49:33.083 --> 00:49:34.167 line:82%
Shut up!

519
00:49:35.417 --> 00:49:36.583 line:82%
Who do you think you are?

520
00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:40.292 line:82%
I wasn't following you.
I have no wish to touch you either.

521
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:44.000 line:82%
You should be grateful I came
or you'd be in jail.

522
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.667 line:82%
Why bother?
Hey, take her away!

523
00:50:32.058 --> 00:50:33.082 line:82%
I am sorry.

524
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:36.087 line:82%
What... What did you say?

525
00:50:38.771 --> 00:50:40.001 line:82%
I am sorry.

526
00:50:40.375 --> 00:50:41.792 line:82%
I said too much in anger.

527
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.375 line:82%
Never mind, Senorita.

528
00:50:45.942 --> 00:50:48.792 line:82%
In big countries such
small things do happen.

529
00:50:49.958 --> 00:50:51.708 line:82%
What do you keep calling me
"Senorita"?

530
00:50:53.075 --> 00:50:55.542 line:82%
My first girlfriend was Spanish.

531
00:50:58.208 --> 00:50:59.600 line:82%
Why did you leave her?

532
00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:03.333 line:82%
She didn't like Indians.

533
00:51:06.917 --> 00:51:09.000 line:82%
You like Indians? Right?

534
00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:11.680 line:82%
When do we get to Zurich?

535
00:51:12.003 --> 00:51:15.042 line:82%
What's in Zurich?
This is the real Europe.

536
00:51:16.958 --> 00:51:19.458 line:82%
So splendid, so beautiful.

537
00:51:20.333 --> 00:51:22.458 line:82%
I fear it might get spoiled
one day.

538
00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:26.625 line:82%
- Is this your first visit?
- Yes.

539
00:51:26.708 --> 00:51:27.709 line:82%
Good, very good.

540
00:51:27.792 --> 00:51:28.792 line:82%
Will you step on it?

541
00:51:29.042 --> 00:51:32.542 line:82%
What's the hurry? The train leaves
at 11:30 tomorrow morning.

542
00:51:32.805 --> 00:51:36.292 line:82%
We have a whole night and
half a day. Why worry?

543
00:51:37.208 --> 00:51:38.625 line:82%
Relax, Senorita.

544
00:51:39.208 --> 00:51:43.750 line:82%
It was meant to happen. You're
with me, nothing can go wrong.

545
00:51:58.208 --> 00:52:01.250 line:82%
Europe looks even better
by foot.

546
00:52:10.375 --> 00:52:11.542 line:82%
There are four in the family.

547
00:52:13.125 --> 00:52:15.083 line:82%
Chutki is a bit precocious.

548
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.882 line:82%
Ma is more like a friend than mother.

549
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:22.000 line:82%
So I didn't need friends.

550
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.667 line:82%
You can't spend your life
with friends.

551
00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:31.542 line:82%
One day you'll need a companion

552
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.792 line:82%
who'll walk by your side
all your life.

553
00:52:37.805 --> 00:52:40.958 line:82%
- Can't walk any more.
- Want me to carry you?

554
00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:43.750 line:82%
I don't have money for a hotel.

555
00:52:44.042 --> 00:52:48.292 line:82%
We'll go to that house and ask
if we can stay. Come on.

556
00:52:50.833 --> 00:52:52.833 line:82%
So we can move in now?
Thank you very much.

557
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.250 line:82%
Found a place for the night.

558
00:53:02.625 --> 00:53:04.477 line:82%
Wow! What a beautiful room.

559
00:53:08.183 --> 00:53:09.235 line:82%
Where's your room?

560
00:53:12.708 --> 00:53:16.457 line:82%
The situation is, Senorita...
there's only one room.

561
00:53:18.653 --> 00:53:22.427 line:82%
Were you hoping we'd spend
the night together?

562
00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.573 line:82%
We have no choice.

563
00:53:25.083 --> 00:53:27.667 line:82%
I do. I'm not staying here.

564
00:53:28.083 --> 00:53:31.780 line:82%
You sleep on the bed, I'll sleep
on the sofa. No problem.

565
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.417 line:82%
No way. I'm off.

566
00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.617 line:82%
Ok, bye.

567
00:53:35.792 --> 00:53:38.184 line:82%
I'm not joking. I'm off.

568
00:53:38.267 --> 00:53:40.417 line:82%
You mean I can have
the whole bed?

569
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.713 line:82%
Good and goodbye.

570
00:53:43.625 --> 00:53:46.182 line:82%
- Ok, bye.
- Bye.

571
00:54:23.203 --> 00:54:26.519 line:82%
Wow! What a beautiful room.

572
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:30.211 line:82%
Isn't it nice and clean?

573
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.711 line:82%
Beautiful curtains!
Gorgeous. See?

574
00:54:37.208 --> 00:54:38.794 line:82%
And the view!

575
00:54:41.007 --> 00:54:42.128 line:82%
No horses?

576
00:54:43.292 --> 00:54:45.794 line:82%
Isn't it cosy here?

577
00:54:46.588 --> 00:54:49.652 line:82%
Oh, you've lit the fire!

578
00:54:52.252 --> 00:54:56.502 line:82%
Simran, I must admit you have
impeccable taste.

579
00:54:58.042 --> 00:55:02.211 line:82%
Can't think of a better place
to spend the night. Right?

580
00:55:07.625 --> 00:55:09.210 line:82%
We had a perfectly good room.

581
00:55:09.857 --> 00:55:14.461 line:82%
But you'd rather sleep in a stable,
than stay with me.

582
00:55:15.138 --> 00:55:17.252 line:82%
Oh, God. I hate girls.

583
00:55:18.312 --> 00:55:19.564 line:82%
Have your dinner.

584
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:22.124 line:82%
Not hungry.

585
00:55:24.542 --> 00:55:28.544 line:82%
OK, don't eat.
What's it to me?

586
00:56:05.132 --> 00:56:06.961 line:82%
Here. Eat it.

587
00:56:08.507 --> 00:56:10.132 line:82%
I told you, I'm not hungry.

588
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.168 line:82%
Come on, eat it.

589
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:17.171 line:82%
I am sorry.

590
00:56:19.318 --> 00:56:20.369 line:82%
What did you say?

591
00:56:26.293 --> 00:56:28.460 line:82%
I said too much in anger.

592
00:56:31.204 --> 00:56:32.254 line:82%
It's ok.

593
00:56:33.095 --> 00:56:36.199 line:82%
In big countries such
small things do happen.

594
00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:40.669 line:82%
You had the right idea, Senorita.

595
00:56:41.168 --> 00:56:44.002 line:82%
This barn is more exciting
than that room.

596
00:56:45.326 --> 00:56:47.168 line:82%
How will we get to Zurich?

597
00:56:47.735 --> 00:56:51.461 line:82%
Forget Zurich. Tomorrow night
we'll get the train from Bern.

598
00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:55.792 line:82%
We'll catch the 8 a.m. bus.
I have it all sorted.

599
00:56:55.875 --> 00:56:58.002 line:82%
You don't worry at all.

600
00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.334 line:82%
From now on, nothing can go wrong.

601
00:57:02.417 --> 00:57:03.501 line:82%
Nothing.

602
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.002 line:82%
- What's that?
- Life!

603
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:38.502 line:82%
Cognac? Aren't you ashamed to
drink in front of a girl?

604
00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:41.127 line:82%
Better than dying in front of
a girl.

605
00:57:41.318 --> 00:57:44.592 line:82%
And if you want to stay alive,
you'd better drink too.

606
00:57:44.895 --> 00:57:46.553 line:82%
Keep away.

607
00:57:46.953 --> 00:57:48.835 line:82%
Alright, don't drink.

608
00:58:02.213 --> 00:58:07.375 line:82%
See you tomorrow morning, if
you're still alive. Until then...

609
00:58:07.458 --> 00:58:08.502 line:82%
Good night.

610
00:59:04.706 --> 00:59:08.212 line:82%
- Let me sway a little.
- Oh, no!

611
00:59:08.445 --> 00:59:11.933 line:82%
- Let me spin around.
- Oh, no!

612
00:59:12.133 --> 00:59:15.449 line:82%
- Let's give you a kiss.
- Oh, no!

613
00:59:15.659 --> 00:59:18.844 line:82%
Watch me fly

614
00:59:19.108 --> 00:59:22.463 line:82%
Like the wind

615
00:59:22.723 --> 00:59:25.981 line:82%
Oh, my God!

616
00:59:26.363 --> 00:59:28.502 line:82%
Save me.

617
01:00:25.921 --> 01:00:28.238 line:82%
The cold breeze

618
01:00:29.643 --> 01:00:31.827 line:82%
Sets my body on fire

619
01:00:33.225 --> 01:00:37.246 line:82%
I'm in the mood to make you

620
01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:40.010 line:82%
my sweetheart

621
01:00:40.313 --> 01:00:43.878 line:82%
This has never happened before

622
01:00:43.961 --> 01:00:47.277 line:82%
I have never behaved like this

623
01:00:47.488 --> 01:00:54.322 line:82%
Watch me fly like the wind

624
01:00:54.642 --> 01:00:57.918 line:82%
Oh, my God!

625
01:00:58.229 --> 01:01:01.815 line:82%
Save me!

626
01:01:02.456 --> 01:01:06.035 line:82%
- Let me dance a bit.
- No, no no!

627
01:01:06.118 --> 01:01:09.668 line:82%
- Let me stroll a bit.
- No, no no!

628
01:01:09.751 --> 01:01:13.764 line:82%
- Let me kiss you.
- No! Not at all!

629
01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.795 line:82%
Where are you going?

630
01:01:43.202 --> 01:01:45.798 line:82%
My little darling

631
01:01:46.835 --> 01:01:53.437 line:82%
You're a gorgeous girl.
And I'm a young man

632
01:01:53.957 --> 01:01:57.089 line:82%
Let me hug you

633
01:01:57.583 --> 01:02:00.755 line:82%
Let me hide you in my eyes

634
01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:07.865 line:82%
I feel drunk already

635
01:02:08.133 --> 01:02:11.787 line:82%
Oh, my God!

636
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:15.646 line:82%
Save me!

637
01:02:15.886 --> 01:02:19.379 line:82%
- Let me sway a little.
- Oh, no!

638
01:02:19.573 --> 01:02:22.879 line:82%
- Let me spin around.
- Oh, no!

639
01:02:23.376 --> 01:02:26.242 line:82%
- Let's give you a kiss.
- Oh, no!

640
01:02:26.845 --> 01:02:30.070 line:82%
Now, I'm...

641
01:02:30.153 --> 01:02:33.699 line:82%
intoxicated!

642
01:02:33.943 --> 01:02:37.464 line:82%
Oh, God of mine

643
01:02:37.547 --> 01:02:42.209 line:82%
Save me

644
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:30.923 line:82%
Good morning.

645
01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:40.461 line:82%
You look even prettier
in the morning.

646
01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:52.085 line:82%
How did I get here?

647
01:03:54.208 --> 01:03:57.211 line:82%
With me, last night.

648
01:03:58.985 --> 01:04:00.966 line:82%
I don't think you've
ever drunk before.

649
01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:04.863 line:82%
You had a bit too much.

650
01:04:06.458 --> 01:04:07.546 line:82%
Here.

651
01:04:09.876 --> 01:04:11.253 line:82%
What happened last night, Raj?

652
01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:15.502 line:82%
Last night...

653
01:04:18.507 --> 01:04:21.087 line:82%
It was meant to happen, Simran.

654
01:04:24.275 --> 01:04:27.920 line:82%
But I never thought it would
happen like this.

655
01:04:28.901 --> 01:04:31.752 line:82%
Tell me the truth.
What happened?

656
01:04:32.838 --> 01:04:34.711 line:82%
How can I tell you, Simran?

657
01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:43.295 line:82%
Look into my eyes. Aren't they
telling the truth?

658
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.669 line:82%
No. It can't be.

659
01:04:50.709 --> 01:04:54.711 line:82%
- It's not true.
- But it is, it is true.

660
01:04:57.383 --> 01:05:00.211 line:82%
We can't change what happened.

661
01:05:00.709 --> 01:05:03.501 line:82%
Lying. You're lying. Right?

662
01:05:03.584 --> 01:05:07.086 line:82%
- No, Simran.
- Please tell me.

663
01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:10.045 line:82%
Alright, I'm lying.

664
01:05:11.213 --> 01:05:16.100 line:82%
My eyes are lying. But are these
love bites lying, too?

665
01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:22.294 line:82%
Tell me, Simran.
Aren't they yours?

666
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.295 line:82%
Don't cry, Simran. I was joking.

667
01:05:29.235 --> 01:05:31.377 line:82%
Here, look. I used your lipstick.

668
01:05:33.386 --> 01:05:36.731 line:82%
You drank too much Cognac.
I had to bring you here.

669
01:05:36.814 --> 01:05:42.253 line:82%
I had no choice, I swear.
You slept alone in the bed.

670
01:05:43.249 --> 01:05:46.265 line:82%
Please, I was joking.

671
01:05:46.678 --> 01:05:50.041 line:82%
Listen to me, Simran.

672
01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:56.295 line:82%
I know what you think of me.

673
01:05:57.626 --> 01:06:01.422 line:82%
You think I'm a good-for-nothing
rascal.

674
01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.961 line:82%
But I'm not that despicable.

675
01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:09.127 line:82%
I'm an Indian man.

676
01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:13.836 line:82%
And I know what honor means
to an Indian woman.

677
01:06:15.335 --> 01:06:18.420 line:82%
I wouldn't take advantage of you,
not in my wildest dreams.

678
01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:22.959 line:82%
Please believe me,
I'm telling you the truth.

679
01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:28.918 line:82%
Nothing happened last night.
It was only a joke.

680
01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:31.876 line:82%
Believe me.

681
01:06:39.959 --> 01:06:43.794 line:82%
Don't joke like that. I don't know
what I would've done.

682
01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:45.917 line:82%
Never joke like that again.

683
01:06:46.584 --> 01:06:47.626 line:82%
I am sorry.

684
01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:52.650 line:82%
I'll never do it again,
I promise... I'm sorry.

685
01:07:15.747 --> 01:07:18.472 line:82%
Hurry, get dressed.
We have a bus to catch.

686
01:07:19.833 --> 01:07:21.983 line:82%
Can I have my shirt back?

687
01:07:40.548 --> 01:07:43.500 line:82%
The bus leaves in ten minutes.
Want something to eat?

688
01:07:45.583 --> 01:07:47.000 line:82%
No, I'm not hungry.

689
01:07:51.615 --> 01:07:53.858 line:82%
Wow! What a beautiful church.

690
01:07:54.458 --> 01:07:55.575 line:82%
Let's take a look.

691
01:07:55.788 --> 01:07:58.160 line:82%
Who wants to look
inside a church?

692
01:07:58.583 --> 01:08:00.653 line:82%
Come on, Raj. It's so beautiful.

693
01:08:02.418 --> 01:08:04.294 line:82%
Yes. It's really beautiful.

694
01:08:04.662 --> 01:08:05.708 line:82%
You go and look.

695
01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.412 line:82%
- What?
- We'll miss our bus.

696
01:09:24.348 --> 01:09:28.419 line:82%
- Shall we go?
- Let's have tea first.

697
01:09:33.497 --> 01:09:34.711 line:82%
What did you pray for?

698
01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:37.836 line:82%
I don't tell what I ask God.

699
01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:41.708 line:82%
You're sure He'll grant your
wishes?

700
01:09:42.983 --> 01:09:47.002 line:82%
I am sure the pure get what
they ask for.

701
01:09:50.583 --> 01:09:51.917 line:82%
You go ahead. I'll join you.

702
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.169 line:82%
- What's wrong?
- Go! I'm coming.

703
01:10:06.792 --> 01:10:08.919 line:82%
Hi, I'm Raj.

704
01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:13.043 line:82%
I'm sorry I don't know
any prayers.

705
01:10:13.487 --> 01:10:16.127 line:82%
I don't want anything for myself.
I'm very happy.

706
01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:20.043 line:82%
But the girl who was here,
Simran...

707
01:10:21.505 --> 01:10:24.169 line:82%
She's lovely. Goodness itself.

708
01:10:25.285 --> 01:10:27.710 line:82%
Whatever she wants,
please give it to her.

709
01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:31.078 line:82%
Please. Thank you.

710
01:10:42.917 --> 01:10:44.016 line:82%
Where were you?

711
01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:48.462 line:82%
In the church?

712
01:11:00.352 --> 01:11:03.380 line:82%
Half a sugar, a drop of milk
and a little cream.

713
01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:04.792 line:82%
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.

714
01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:08.127 line:82%
Want a postcard to send home?

715
01:11:09.617 --> 01:11:13.544 line:82%
If Pops gets a postcard, he'll think
I've died and gone to heaven.

716
01:11:14.417 --> 01:11:15.918 line:82%
Are you ever serious?

717
01:11:16.001 --> 01:11:19.445 line:82%
Never. And if I ever am,
it'll be just one time.

718
01:11:19.528 --> 01:11:23.419 line:82%
- When will that be?
- When I fall in love with someone.

719
01:11:23.695 --> 01:11:26.694 line:82%
Don't tell me a guy like you
has never been in love.

720
01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:30.794 line:82%
I've had lots of affairs. But love?
Never.

721
01:11:31.592 --> 01:11:33.002 line:82%
Didn't find the right girl.

722
01:11:33.382 --> 01:11:34.809 line:82%
What kind of girl do you want?

723
01:11:36.475 --> 01:11:37.580 line:82%
Shall I tell you?

724
01:11:39.653 --> 01:11:42.876 line:82%
The moment I see that girl...

725
01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:46.876 line:82%
she'll awaken my every
dream and desire.

726
01:11:47.152 --> 01:11:48.297 line:82%
How sweet.

727
01:11:48.703 --> 01:11:50.011 line:82%
It's never happened.

728
01:11:50.862 --> 01:11:54.460 line:82%
But I feel someone I've never
seen or met

729
01:11:55.958 --> 01:11:57.793 line:82%
calls me from behind the clouds.

730
01:11:58.833 --> 01:12:00.863 line:82%
Who knows when the clouds
will part...

731
01:12:01.754 --> 01:12:04.169 line:82%
or when she will appear before me.

732
01:12:08.663 --> 01:12:10.711 line:82%
Has that ever happened to you?

733
01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.871 line:82%
Has a complete stranger ever crept
into your thoughts?

734
01:12:18.288 --> 01:12:21.087 line:82%
I've no room in my thoughts
for a stranger.

735
01:12:24.313 --> 01:12:25.899 line:82%
My marriage has been arranged.

736
01:12:31.862 --> 01:12:33.597 line:82%
Your marriage has been arranged?

737
01:12:35.175 --> 01:12:36.515 line:82%
Congratulations!

738
01:12:36.598 --> 01:12:38.261 line:82%
Where does the groom live?
London?

739
01:12:38.628 --> 01:12:40.043 line:82%
No, in India.

740
01:12:40.126 --> 01:12:43.092 line:82%
What does he look like?
Tall? Dark? Handsome...?

741
01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:46.211 line:82%
Don't know. I've never met him.

742
01:12:48.403 --> 01:12:52.420 line:82%
You've never met the man
you're going to marry?

743
01:12:53.042 --> 01:12:54.503 line:82%
I don't need to.

744
01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:58.086 line:82%
Father has met him. He's a
family friend's son.

745
01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:03.586 line:82%
You're willing to spend
the rest of your life...

746
01:13:04.418 --> 01:13:07.211 line:82%
with a man you've never met?

747
01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:10.877 line:82%
A man who is a complete
stranger?

748
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.752 line:82%
It's the tradition of our family.

749
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:19.610 line:82%
Are you happy about the decision?

750
01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:32.795 line:82%
The train is here.

751
01:13:58.458 --> 01:13:59.627 line:82%
This is nice.

752
01:14:01.417 --> 01:14:02.877 line:82%
Yeah, this is also good.

753
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.171 line:82%
I like this one.

754
01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:19.500 line:82%
Simran, lovely photographs.

755
01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:23.604 line:82%
Send me copies of the pictures.
And your wedding photos.

756
01:14:24.465 --> 01:14:28.138 line:82%
- Aren't you coming?
- Not all that way.

757
01:14:28.417 --> 01:14:32.777 line:82%
- Sheena, you must.
- I'll be there. I was joking.

758
01:14:33.038 --> 01:14:38.100 line:82%
I must meet your husband to see
which idiot you're marrying.

759
01:14:42.026 --> 01:14:43.091 line:82%
Excuse me.

760
01:14:43.458 --> 01:14:44.668 line:82%
This fell.

761
01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.336 line:82%
I'll be right back.

762
01:15:22.857 --> 01:15:25.372 line:82%
Why are you looking at me
like that?

763
01:15:26.617 --> 01:15:29.919 line:82%
There's something I want
to tell you, Simran.

764
01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:32.084 line:82%
Go ahead.

765
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.426 line:82%
I've fallen in love with you.

766
01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:42.104 line:82%
I love you, Simran.

767
01:15:55.917 --> 01:15:57.669 line:82%
Look at your face.

768
01:16:00.333 --> 01:16:02.502 line:82%
You thought I was telling
the truth.

769
01:16:04.292 --> 01:16:06.127 line:82%
You're amazing, Simran.

770
01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:09.544 line:82%
You still haven't figured me out.

771
01:16:10.337 --> 01:16:13.919 line:82%
Remember I told you
I've never been serious.

772
01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:17.128 line:82%
- Just look at your face.
- You're just too much.

773
01:16:17.417 --> 01:16:20.419 line:82%
This love business isn't for me.

774
01:16:21.107 --> 01:16:26.223 line:82%
How can a man spend his entire
life with the same girl?

775
01:16:26.306 --> 01:16:29.334 line:82%
There are so many pretty girls
in this world.

776
01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:33.917 line:82%
Some have great eyes, others
have great lips, great hair...

777
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.290 line:82%
...You men are all the same.

778
01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:37.169 line:82%
That's me all over.

779
01:16:37.337 --> 01:16:39.834 line:82%
But you've outsmarted me.

780
01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:45.170 line:82%
You can spend the rest
of your life with a man

781
01:16:46.125 --> 01:16:49.170 line:82%
whose face you've never
even seen.

782
01:16:50.792 --> 01:16:54.003 line:82%
Bravo! That's true love.

783
01:17:01.847 --> 01:17:03.500 line:82%
Well, never mind.

784
01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:06.375 line:82%
But what if you fell in love
with someone else?

785
01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:08.336 line:82%
Imagine you met someone
on this holiday

786
01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:10.347 line:82%
and fell in love with him.

787
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:15.586 line:82%
Anyone, say me. What if
we fell for each other.

788
01:17:19.333 --> 01:17:20.529 line:82%
What would you do then?

789
01:17:22.042 --> 01:17:25.878 line:82%
Would you still go back and
marry that total stranger?

790
01:17:27.583 --> 01:17:31.502 line:82%
Or would you have the guts
to love me?

791
01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:35.745 line:82%
What would you do?

792
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.419 line:82%
I don't want to miss
the train again.

793
01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:51.044 line:82%
I want us to miss it always.

794
01:17:51.808 --> 01:17:52.811 line:82%
What?

795
01:17:54.184 --> 01:17:55.203 line:82%
Nothing.

796
01:18:00.083 --> 01:18:04.294 line:82%
Raj, if she loves you,
she'll turn around and look.

797
01:18:08.602 --> 01:18:09.616 line:82%
Turn around.

798
01:18:16.413 --> 01:18:17.445 line:82%
Turn.

799
01:18:49.453 --> 01:18:52.586 line:82%
Bye, Ponchi. I'll give you a call.

800
01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:57.294 line:82%
See you, Rocky. I'll call you.
Bye, Sheena.

801
01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:06.252 line:82%
This is it.

802
01:19:07.408 --> 01:19:08.567 line:82%
Back in London.

803
01:19:10.042 --> 01:19:11.625 line:82%
How the month flew by!

804
01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:16.292 line:82%
Thank you for everything.

805
01:19:17.917 --> 01:19:20.458 line:82%
- It's all right.
- Friends?

806
01:19:34.526 --> 01:19:37.161 line:82%
- Thanks, see you.
- Bye.

807
01:19:37.924 --> 01:19:41.695 line:82%
Raj, you didn't give me
your address.

808
01:19:42.208 --> 01:19:44.592 line:82%
I'll send you a wedding invite.
Will you come?

809
01:19:47.922 --> 01:19:49.918 line:82%
No, I won't come.

810
01:20:18.249 --> 01:20:21.127 line:82%
I don't know what has

811
01:20:22.375 --> 01:20:25.085 line:82%
come over my heart

812
01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:33.419 line:82%
I had it here with me

813
01:20:36.775 --> 01:20:39.713 line:82%
Now it's gone missing

814
01:20:40.167 --> 01:20:42.822 line:82%
I don't know what has

815
01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:47.382 line:82%
come over my heart

816
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:51.730 line:82%
I had it here with me

817
01:20:52.265 --> 01:20:53.750 line:82%
Now it's gone missing

818
01:20:55.311 --> 01:20:57.915 line:82%
I don't know what has

819
01:20:57.998 --> 01:21:02.384 line:82%
come over my heart

820
01:21:03.043 --> 01:21:09.694 line:82%
I had it here with me.
Now it's gone missing

821
01:21:09.992 --> 01:21:13.835 line:82%
Oh, darling, you've fallen in love

822
01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:18.669 line:82%
Deny it a hundred times
if you must

823
01:21:28.915 --> 01:21:33.106 line:82%
Sweet love, this is what
love is all about

824
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:26.671 line:82%
You didn't turn around
and look at me

825
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.545 line:82%
I waited for a while

826
01:22:31.742 --> 01:22:36.462 line:82%
I felt like stopping you
from leaving

827
01:22:36.833 --> 01:22:40.212 line:82%
but you were already gone

828
01:22:40.875 --> 01:22:42.878 line:82%
What is happening?

829
01:22:43.419 --> 01:22:45.575 line:82%
I don't know

830
01:22:45.658 --> 01:22:47.959 line:82%
Why is my heart

831
01:22:48.042 --> 01:22:49.794 line:82%
so crazed?

832
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:54.544 line:82%
Oh, darling, you've fallen in love

833
01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:59.545 line:82%
Deny it a hundred times
if you must

834
01:23:48.376 --> 01:23:52.669 line:82%
Oh time, slow down, stay awhile

835
01:23:53.125 --> 01:23:57.215 line:82%
Go back to days gone past

836
01:23:57.917 --> 01:24:02.336 line:82%
The place where I left my heart

837
01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:06.586 line:82%
is far behind me now

838
01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:11.378 line:82%
- Where am I?
- Where are you?

839
01:24:11.725 --> 01:24:15.961 line:82%
- What is this...
- ... Magic?

840
01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:21.045 line:82%
Oh, darling, you've fallen in love

841
01:24:21.628 --> 01:24:26.088 line:82%
Deny it a hundred times
if you must

842
01:24:35.667 --> 01:24:40.503 line:82%
Sweet love, this is what
love is about

843
01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:21.587 line:82%
What has come over my heart?

844
01:25:27.069 --> 01:25:32.377 line:82%
I had it here with me

845
01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.333 line:82%
Now it's gone missing

846
01:25:58.293 --> 01:26:01.377 line:82%
Ma, remember that dream
in my diary?

847
01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:06.294 line:82%
The face I saw in the palm
of my hand?

848
01:26:07.535 --> 01:26:09.911 line:82%
The one I wanted to meet.

849
01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:13.956 line:82%
I met him, Ma. He came to me.

850
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:18.961 line:82%
What? What are you saying?

851
01:26:19.847 --> 01:26:24.878 line:82%
Yes, Ma. When I left home,
I could see the future clearly.

852
01:26:25.617 --> 01:26:28.836 line:82%
I wanted to live a lifetime
in a month.

853
01:26:29.763 --> 01:26:32.545 line:82%
Then go back to my own country

854
01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:35.836 line:82%
and get married to a total stranger.

855
01:26:36.667 --> 01:26:38.920 line:82%
I had made peace with destiny, Ma.

856
01:26:40.667 --> 01:26:44.003 line:82%
How could I have guessed
this would happen?

857
01:26:45.817 --> 01:26:47.545 line:82%
He entered my life like a storm.

858
01:26:47.875 --> 01:26:50.753 line:82%
And like a falling leaf
I flew with him.

859
01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:58.420 line:82%
I once read that love could be
all sorts of things.

860
01:26:58.958 --> 01:27:00.544 line:82%
But I never understood it.

861
01:27:01.625 --> 01:27:05.922 line:82%
Not even when he held my hand
for the first time.

862
01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:08.669 line:82%
I spent so much time with him.

863
01:27:09.628 --> 01:27:11.086 line:82%
I still didn't get it.

864
01:27:12.288 --> 01:27:16.463 line:82%
But today at the station when he
was leaving...

865
01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:19.503 line:82%
I suddenly realized

866
01:27:20.667 --> 01:27:24.420 line:82%
that I would never see him again.

867
01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:29.586 line:82%
I kept looking back
as he was walking away.

868
01:27:30.292 --> 01:27:31.690 line:82%
I wanted to stop him.

869
01:27:31.773 --> 01:27:33.252 line:82%
Say something.

870
01:27:34.167 --> 01:27:35.544 line:82%
Hear him.

871
01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:38.669 line:82%
He didn't stop.

872
01:27:39.752 --> 01:27:43.045 line:82%
But I understood that's what
love is all about.

873
01:27:44.188 --> 01:27:46.752 line:82%
Now he is in my every dream.

874
01:27:49.227 --> 01:27:51.754 line:82%
I don't know whether
he loves me or not.

875
01:27:52.398 --> 01:27:55.835 line:82%
All I know is that...
he is my life.

876
01:27:57.187 --> 01:27:58.919 line:82%
I can't belong to someone else.

877
01:27:59.458 --> 01:28:01.387 line:82%
I love him, Ma. I really...

878
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.209 line:82%
Oh, you're up!

879
01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:22.628 line:82%
Simi and I were chatting.
I didn't realize the time.

880
01:28:39.167 --> 01:28:43.794 line:82%
I asked you not to betray my trust.

881
01:28:46.542 --> 01:28:48.419 line:82%
I made you promise.

882
01:28:50.167 --> 01:28:51.543 line:82%
But you deceived me.

883
01:28:52.242 --> 01:28:53.292 line:82%
No, Father.

884
01:28:54.685 --> 01:28:56.221 line:82%
I won't hear a word!

885
01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:03.914 line:82%
Pack your bags. We're leaving
for India tomorrow.

886
01:29:05.917 --> 01:29:07.318 line:82%
For good.

887
01:29:13.167 --> 01:29:14.627 line:82%
Let her cry.

888
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:18.627 line:82%
She gave her fate those tears.

889
01:29:19.583 --> 01:29:23.669 line:82%
She'll learn how to stop them.
Let her cry.

890
01:29:54.162 --> 01:29:55.627 line:82%
Good evening.

891
01:29:56.875 --> 01:29:57.961 line:82%
Beer?

892
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.419 line:82%
- What's the girl's name?
- Simran.

893
01:30:05.625 --> 01:30:07.211 line:82%
What girl, Pops?

894
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:12.211 line:82%
The one you're looking for
in the face of the moon.

895
01:30:12.542 --> 01:30:15.959 line:82%
You know me, I never fall
for one girl.

896
01:30:16.042 --> 01:30:20.167 line:82%
Oh, I forgot. Some have great lips
others have great eyes.

897
01:30:20.375 --> 01:30:22.252 line:82%
- Exactly...
- ...Exactly.

898
01:30:24.292 --> 01:30:26.711 line:82%
- Where does she live?
- Who, Pops?

899
01:30:28.542 --> 01:30:29.586 line:82%
Simran.

900
01:30:35.833 --> 01:30:36.877 line:82%
I don't know.

901
01:30:38.792 --> 01:30:40.128 line:82%
What's she like?

902
01:30:41.208 --> 01:30:42.544 line:82%
Very lovely.

903
01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:46.033 line:82%
What's the problem?

904
01:30:47.722 --> 01:30:51.878 line:82%
The problem is... she's about
to be married.

905
01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:54.420 line:82%
We'll stop the wedding.

906
01:30:55.708 --> 01:30:58.995 line:82%
Your time was different.
Times have changed.

907
01:31:01.167 --> 01:31:06.159 line:82%
Love is still called love.
Some things never change.

908
01:31:06.242 --> 01:31:08.211 line:82%
No, Pops. It's too late now.

909
01:31:09.167 --> 01:31:11.128 line:82%
She'll soon belong to another.

910
01:31:12.125 --> 01:31:14.961 line:82%
A bride belongs to the man
who brings her home.

911
01:31:15.833 --> 01:31:17.959 line:82%
I didn't father you to strum
your banjo.

912
01:31:19.042 --> 01:31:22.462 line:82%
We folk don't stare at the moon,
we bring the moon home.

913
01:31:23.083 --> 01:31:27.723 line:82%
Now go. Don't come back till
you bring your bride home.

914
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:45.144 line:82%
Good!

915
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:13.250 line:82%
They've moved out.

916
01:32:13.333 --> 01:32:16.835 line:82%
Their daughter's marrying. They're
resettling in Punjab.

917
01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:47.211 line:82%
I'm coming, Simran.

918
01:32:49.507 --> 01:32:50.519 line:82%
I'm coming.

919
01:33:46.688 --> 01:33:52.128 line:82%
Come home, now.
We wait for you

920
01:33:52.211 --> 01:33:55.234 line:82%
You can hear the girls' anklets
chime at the riverbank for you

921
01:33:55.317 --> 01:33:57.765 line:82%
Mustard sways in the fields.
Another year has passed

922
01:33:57.848 --> 01:34:02.978 line:82%
Come home to me. I wait for you

923
01:34:03.061 --> 01:34:08.206 line:82%
Come home, oh stranger.
Your country calls you

924
01:34:08.289 --> 01:34:13.345 line:82%
Come home, oh stranger.
Your country calls you

925
01:34:32.771 --> 01:34:34.683 line:82%
Bless me, Mother.

926
01:34:44.155 --> 01:34:46.958 line:82%
No, Mother. No.

927
01:34:49.261 --> 01:34:50.593 line:82%
Son,

928
01:34:51.624 --> 01:34:57.146 line:82%
I have held these tears back
for 20 years.

929
01:35:00.608 --> 01:35:03.108 line:82%
They won't be stopped today.

930
01:35:11.816 --> 01:35:13.399 line:82%
My darling Simran.

931
01:35:14.316 --> 01:35:16.566 line:82%
My sweet little doll.

932
01:35:20.774 --> 01:35:23.608 line:82%
- How are you?
- Same as ever.

933
01:35:24.274 --> 01:35:28.626 line:82%
Now you're the bride's aunt,
find yourself a groom.

934
01:35:28.858 --> 01:35:34.269 line:82%
I've tried for years, but there's
no one worthy.

935
01:35:34.631 --> 01:35:37.593 line:82%
I think a handsome foreigner
has to come for me.

936
01:35:37.858 --> 01:35:40.068 line:82%
You haven't changed a bit.

937
01:35:42.476 --> 01:35:46.946 line:82%
You made us wait for ages.
Better late than never.

938
01:35:47.231 --> 01:35:49.985 line:82%
My dear wife, will you excuse us?

939
01:35:54.108 --> 01:35:55.316 line:82%
Guess who she is.

940
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:59.518 line:82%
You don't recognize her?

941
01:35:59.734 --> 01:36:02.610 line:82%
She's my daughter, Preeti,
Kuljit's sister.

942
01:36:02.896 --> 01:36:05.233 line:82%
May you live long!

943
01:36:06.701 --> 01:36:11.499 line:82%
Amazing. 20 years and she's all
grown up. She's gorgeous.

944
01:36:11.731 --> 01:36:14.402 line:82%
- Like her father.
- Come off it!

945
01:36:15.026 --> 01:36:16.870 line:82%
Where is Kuljit?
- Yes, where is he?

946
01:36:17.133 --> 01:36:19.983 line:82%
He went hunting.
He'll be back soon.

947
01:36:44.066 --> 01:36:46.066 line:82%
- My respects.
- May you live long.

948
01:36:50.608 --> 01:36:54.649 line:82%
- He's a real Punjabi lad.
- Like his father.

949
01:36:56.399 --> 01:36:57.899 line:82%
Come and have breakfast.

950
01:36:58.194 --> 01:37:00.441 line:82%
Let's go. Come.

951
01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:04.733 line:82%
This is for you,
this is for you...

952
01:37:06.858 --> 01:37:10.066 line:82%
- Will you show me around?
- Yes, Sister.

953
01:37:40.399 --> 01:37:42.899 line:82%
Children, grandma wants you
downstairs.

954
01:38:03.776 --> 01:38:05.073 line:82%
You know something, Simi?

955
01:38:05.319 --> 01:38:09.191 line:82%
When I was young, your
grandfather used to say

956
01:38:10.649 --> 01:38:13.608 line:82%
there's no difference between
a man and a woman.

957
01:38:14.733 --> 01:38:17.441 line:82%
They both have equal rights.

958
01:38:19.024 --> 01:38:21.608 line:82%
I grew up believing
this was true.

959
01:38:22.774 --> 01:38:27.524 line:82%
But as I grew older, I realized
what a big lie that was.

960
01:38:30.524 --> 01:38:31.899 line:82%
I had to give up my studies.

961
01:38:32.608 --> 01:38:34.858 line:82%
My brothers' education
was more important.

962
01:38:36.816 --> 01:38:38.483 line:82%
That was my first sacrifice.

963
01:38:40.316 --> 01:38:41.858 line:82%
The sacrifices never ended.

964
01:38:42.566 --> 01:38:47.941 line:82%
First as a daughter, then as a sister.
Then as a wife. My choices ended.

965
01:38:50.733 --> 01:38:52.358 line:82%
But when you were born...

966
01:38:53.608 --> 01:38:56.733 line:82%
and I held you for the
first time

967
01:38:58.108 --> 01:39:00.441 line:82%
I made myself a promise.

968
01:39:01.858 --> 01:39:05.858 line:82%
My daughter would never suffer
what I suffered.

969
01:39:07.774 --> 01:39:12.566 line:82%
She would not make sacrifices
at every stage in life.

970
01:39:14.108 --> 01:39:15.733 line:82%
So what if she is a girl?

971
01:39:16.774 --> 01:39:18.566 line:82%
She will live her life
as she pleases.

972
01:39:19.441 --> 01:39:21.691 line:82%
She'll have her share of happiness.

973
01:39:23.566 --> 01:39:25.233 line:82%
But I was wrong, Simran.

974
01:39:25.899 --> 01:39:30.316 line:82%
I forgot women have no right
to make promises either.

975
01:39:31.649 --> 01:39:35.524 line:82%
They're born to sacrifice
themselves for men.

976
01:39:36.733 --> 01:39:41.733 line:82%
But men don't sacrifice anything
for women. Nor will they.

977
01:39:43.566 --> 01:39:46.358 line:82%
This is why today, your mother

978
01:39:47.524 --> 01:39:49.191 line:82%
asks you to find happiness.

979
01:39:51.899 --> 01:39:54.816 line:82%
Forget him, my daughter.
Forget him.

980
01:39:56.691 --> 01:39:59.441 line:82%
Your father won't understand.
your tears.

981
01:40:01.339 --> 01:40:05.399 line:82%
I beg you. Keep peace
in this house.

982
01:40:07.983 --> 01:40:09.191 line:82%
Forget him, child.

983
01:40:10.256 --> 01:40:11.374 line:82%
Forget him.

984
01:40:28.858 --> 01:40:30.108 line:82%
You're right, Ma.

985
01:40:31.858 --> 01:40:33.274 line:82%
I'm so naive.

986
01:40:35.163 --> 01:40:39.233 line:82%
I don't even know if
he loves me or not.

987
01:40:41.524 --> 01:40:46.691 line:82%
I know my father would
only think of my happiness.

988
01:40:49.608 --> 01:40:53.608 line:82%
Can't I make a little sacrifice
so he's happy?

989
01:40:56.381 --> 01:40:57.419 line:82%
Go, Ma.

990
01:40:58.548 --> 01:41:02.906 line:82%
Tell Father I'm ready
to get married.

991
01:41:05.816 --> 01:41:07.691 line:82%
I will not make any trouble.

992
01:41:54.824 --> 01:41:58.441 line:82%
Lucky man, Kuljit! Your girl is
an eye-grabber.

993
01:41:59.066 --> 01:42:02.649 line:82%
Forget Kuljit's girl.
I'm the lucky man.

994
01:42:04.191 --> 01:42:05.816 line:82%
Chukti, you're so cute.

995
01:42:06.608 --> 01:42:09.058 line:82%
Excuse me, I am not a baby.

996
01:42:09.441 --> 01:42:13.444 line:82%
My name is Miss Rajeshwari Singh.

997
01:42:14.341 --> 01:42:18.399 line:82%
She's pretty sassy.
What about her sister?

998
01:42:19.381 --> 01:42:22.441 line:82%
Let me get married first.
Then I'll tell you.

999
01:42:25.484 --> 01:42:26.646 line:82%
Listen to me.

1000
01:42:27.016 --> 01:42:30.816 line:82%
The engagement is in two days.
The wedding on the 25th.

1001
01:42:36.274 --> 01:42:38.316 line:82%
Let's have some sweets.

1002
01:43:10.881 --> 01:43:12.774 line:82%
Here comes the kheer!

1003
01:43:26.566 --> 01:43:28.816 line:82%
Something is troubling me,
Baldev.

1004
01:43:29.899 --> 01:43:34.171 line:82%
I don't know why,
but in Simran's eyes

1005
01:43:34.858 --> 01:43:36.316 line:82%
I see sadness.

1006
01:43:37.524 --> 01:43:40.399 line:82%
She doesn't laugh with
an open heart.

1007
01:43:41.899 --> 01:43:43.108 line:82%
Is everything all right?

1008
01:43:44.233 --> 01:43:45.441 line:82%
Don't worry, Mother.

1009
01:43:45.983 --> 01:43:49.858 line:82%
It's a new place, new people.
A different climate.

1010
01:43:50.483 --> 01:43:54.816 line:82%
She'll be fine in a few days.
Don't worry about it.

1011
01:43:57.441 --> 01:43:58.774 line:82%
Have some kheer.

1012
01:44:01.808 --> 01:44:03.566 line:82%
Hasn't Simran forgotten him yet?

1013
01:44:04.693 --> 01:44:07.691 line:82%
She's agreed to the marriage.

1014
01:44:08.358 --> 01:44:10.649 line:82%
She'll forget everything
bit by bit.

1015
01:44:11.566 --> 01:44:14.399 line:82%
If she keeps thinking of him,
she'll regret it.

1016
01:45:24.899 --> 01:45:30.097 line:82%
When I saw you I knew

1017
01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:32.999 line:82%
my beloved

1018
01:45:37.788 --> 01:45:44.221 line:82%
Love is a crazy thing

1019
01:46:38.899 --> 01:46:43.953 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1020
01:46:44.036 --> 01:46:48.446 line:82%
Love is a crazy thing

1021
01:46:49.003 --> 01:46:54.040 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1022
01:46:54.123 --> 01:46:58.962 line:82%
Love is a crazy thing

1023
01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:04.108 line:82%
Where do we go from here?

1024
01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:08.385 line:82%
I could just die in your arms

1025
01:47:09.441 --> 01:47:14.196 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1026
01:47:14.567 --> 01:47:19.156 line:82%
Love is a crazy thing

1027
01:47:19.416 --> 01:47:24.354 line:82%
Where do we go from here?

1028
01:47:24.733 --> 01:47:28.878 line:82%
I could just die in your arms

1029
01:47:29.727 --> 01:47:34.025 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1030
01:48:08.441 --> 01:48:09.899 line:82%
These eyes of mine

1031
01:48:11.025 --> 01:48:12.566 line:82%
dream of you

1032
01:48:13.108 --> 01:48:15.566 line:82%
This heart of mine
longs only for you

1033
01:48:18.566 --> 01:48:23.142 line:82%
There's nothing I can call my own,
it all belongs to you

1034
01:48:23.225 --> 01:48:25.628 line:82%
My very life is yours

1035
01:48:27.858 --> 01:48:32.780 line:82%
Your tears fill my eyes

1036
01:48:32.863 --> 01:48:36.897 line:82%
Sadness breaks into a smile

1037
01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.649 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1038
01:48:43.082 --> 01:48:47.755 line:82%
Love is a crazy thing

1039
01:48:48.038 --> 01:48:52.998 line:82%
Where do we go from here?

1040
01:48:53.233 --> 01:48:57.388 line:82%
I could just die in your arms

1041
01:48:58.268 --> 01:49:03.162 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1042
01:49:24.358 --> 01:49:28.838 line:82%
This heart of mine finds
happiness nowhere

1043
01:49:29.054 --> 01:49:32.482 line:82%
What can I say?
What can I do?

1044
01:49:34.566 --> 01:49:39.171 line:82%
Sit right here, in front of me

1045
01:49:39.254 --> 01:49:42.181 line:82%
So I can keep looking at you

1046
01:49:43.858 --> 01:49:48.391 line:82%
You called me. See, here I am

1047
01:49:48.875 --> 01:49:53.653 line:82%
Is there a bigger oath
than love?

1048
01:49:53.736 --> 01:49:58.506 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1049
01:49:58.968 --> 01:50:02.515 line:82%
Love is a crazy thing

1050
01:50:03.928 --> 01:50:08.744 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1051
01:50:09.134 --> 01:50:13.135 line:82%
Love is a crazy thing

1052
01:50:13.817 --> 01:50:17.831 line:82%
Where do we go from here?

1053
01:50:19.057 --> 01:50:23.887 line:82%
I could just die in your arms

1054
01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:34.171 line:82%
I could just die in your arms

1055
01:51:12.983 --> 01:51:15.829 line:82%
Take me away from here, Raj.

1056
01:51:16.641 --> 01:51:17.661 line:82%
What?

1057
01:51:19.747 --> 01:51:22.110 line:82%
You don't know what's going on.

1058
01:51:22.941 --> 01:51:26.360 line:82%
I'm getting engaged in two days,
and married in two weeks.

1059
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:29.360 line:82%
The arrangements are made.

1060
01:51:30.399 --> 01:51:35.152 line:82%
My father gave his friend his word,
and his word is his life.

1061
01:51:36.524 --> 01:51:40.736 line:82%
He'd do anything, but could never
go back on his word.

1062
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:45.124 line:82%
We have to run away, Raj.

1063
01:51:46.163 --> 01:51:51.319 line:82%
No, Simran. I didn't come here
to run away with you.

1064
01:51:52.483 --> 01:51:56.569 line:82%
I may have been born in
England, but I'm Indian.

1065
01:51:58.774 --> 01:52:01.611 line:82%
I came here to make you
my bride.

1066
01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:04.902 line:82%
I'll only take you away

1067
01:52:05.317 --> 01:52:08.884 line:82%
when your father gives
your hand to me.

1068
01:52:09.482 --> 01:52:11.608 line:82%
You don't know my father, Raj.

1069
01:52:12.899 --> 01:52:16.361 line:82%
We have to run away, Raj.
Please! Take me away.

1070
01:52:21.483 --> 01:52:25.276 line:82%
- Do you love me?
- More than anything.

1071
01:52:26.774 --> 01:52:30.179 line:82%
- Do you trust me?
- More than myself.

1072
01:52:32.524 --> 01:52:35.402 line:82%
So listen to me carefully.

1073
01:52:36.941 --> 01:52:41.069 line:82%
From today we're strangers. I don't
know you, you don't know me.

1074
01:52:41.733 --> 01:52:45.652 line:82%
Go home. Let things go as planned.
Leave the rest to me.

1075
01:52:47.942 --> 01:52:50.444 line:82%
I know what I'm trying isn't easy.

1076
01:52:51.024 --> 01:52:54.027 line:82%
But I have complete faith
in our love.

1077
01:52:54.899 --> 01:52:58.777 line:82%
But, Simran, I cannot walk
this path alone.

1078
01:52:59.566 --> 01:53:03.111 line:82%
You must be my strength
and walk by my side.

1079
01:53:05.816 --> 01:53:07.082 line:82%
Will you stand by me?

1080
01:53:12.399 --> 01:53:13.985 line:82%
Remember one thing.

1081
01:53:15.108 --> 01:53:17.735 line:82%
I came here for you.

1082
01:53:19.149 --> 01:53:22.031 line:82%
Until you belong to me forever,

1083
01:53:23.632 --> 01:53:25.483 line:82%
I won't leave.

1084
01:53:32.983 --> 01:53:36.777 line:82%
What's the name of the man
you're marrying?

1085
01:53:37.483 --> 01:53:38.860 line:82%
Kuljit Singh.

1086
01:54:07.983 --> 01:54:09.068 line:82%
Help!

1087
01:54:09.733 --> 01:54:10.943 line:82%
Anyone there?

1088
01:54:11.524 --> 01:54:12.610 line:82%
Help me.

1089
01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:16.068 line:82%
Where is everyone?

1090
01:54:16.983 --> 01:54:18.068 line:82%
Help!

1091
01:54:50.275 --> 01:54:53.857 line:82%
If Raj hadn't saved me, the hunter
would have become the hunted.

1092
01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:54.983 line:82%
Come on.

1093
01:54:55.066 --> 01:54:59.237 line:82%
- You've won me over, Raj
- What are you saying?

1094
01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.109 line:82%
Are you new here?
Never seen you before.

1095
01:55:03.484 --> 01:55:05.786 line:82%
I'm from London. Cheers!

1096
01:55:05.869 --> 01:55:07.834 line:82%
A guest from abroad.

1097
01:55:10.563 --> 01:55:12.429 line:82%
What brings you here?

1098
01:55:14.441 --> 01:55:16.545 line:82%
I need to achieve something.

1099
01:55:17.399 --> 01:55:19.139 line:82%
What? Tell us.

1100
01:55:20.649 --> 01:55:22.084 line:82%
Some land.

1101
01:55:23.399 --> 01:55:27.319 line:82%
I want to buy some land
and build a factory.

1102
01:55:28.109 --> 01:55:29.443 line:82%
What kind of factory?

1103
01:55:31.983 --> 01:55:34.458 line:82%
A beer factory. Stroh's Beer.
Everybody, cheers!

1104
01:55:36.651 --> 01:55:40.700 line:82%
Kuljit, is 10 million pounds
enough to buy a factory?

1105
01:55:42.736 --> 01:55:45.698 line:82%
- What's wrong?
- 10 million pounds?

1106
01:55:45.941 --> 01:55:47.904 line:82%
Not enough? I could get more.

1107
01:55:49.066 --> 01:55:51.399 line:82%
No, pal. That's a lot.
More than enough.

1108
01:55:51.482 --> 01:55:53.735 line:82%
Oh, thank God! You're so nice.

1109
01:55:54.192 --> 01:55:56.860 line:82%
God works miracles like
introducing you to me.

1110
01:55:57.359 --> 01:56:00.224 line:82%
- We'll get along well, superbly....
- Sure. Of course.

1111
01:56:00.307 --> 01:56:03.152 line:82%
You want to build a factory?
It's done.

1112
01:56:03.447 --> 01:56:04.692 line:82%
Done, my friend!

1113
01:56:04.924 --> 01:56:06.028 line:82%
Thank you.

1114
01:56:06.238 --> 01:56:07.429 line:82%
Raj...

1115
01:56:09.650 --> 01:56:11.821 line:82%
Where are you staying?

1116
01:56:12.442 --> 01:56:17.557 line:82%
I don't know a soul here. So I'm
staying at the Circuit House.

1117
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:21.861 line:82%
Like hell you are!
Now you know someone.

1118
01:56:22.151 --> 01:56:26.829 line:82%
I've a huge house and you're staying
at a guest house? No way!

1119
01:56:27.067 --> 01:56:29.525 line:82%
Binda, bring his luggage over.

1120
01:56:29.608 --> 01:56:32.653 line:82%
- It's not...
- I won't hear another word.

1121
01:56:32.924 --> 01:56:36.609 line:82%
You saved my life, Kuljit's life.
It's the least I can do.

1122
01:56:37.438 --> 01:56:41.108 line:82%
I know you're a London big shot,
but I'm a lion from Punjab.

1123
01:56:41.608 --> 01:56:43.401 line:82%
We'll have a riot.

1124
01:56:44.718 --> 01:56:47.275 line:82%
If you insist, I'll do
as you please.

1125
01:56:47.358 --> 01:56:50.777 line:82%
- That's more like it.
- Meet young ladies?

1126
01:56:53.261 --> 01:56:54.442 line:82%
We'll have a blast!

1127
01:56:55.442 --> 01:56:57.151 line:82%
Aren't you going?

1128
01:56:58.775 --> 01:57:01.901 line:82%
Hurry, on the double.
And get some Black Label.

1129
01:57:01.984 --> 01:57:04.486 line:82%
We'll have some Scotch whisky.

1130
01:57:09.026 --> 01:57:11.191 line:82%
- Cheers.
- Pass me the lighter.

1131
01:57:16.692 --> 01:57:20.619 line:82%
We're deeply indebted to you
for saving Kuljit's life.

1132
01:57:20.702 --> 01:57:25.069 line:82%
- No, Maaji. It was my duty.
- May you live long, son.

1133
01:57:27.192 --> 01:57:29.901 line:82%
Preeti, some sweets for Raj.

1134
01:57:31.233 --> 01:57:32.334 line:82%
Thank you.

1135
01:57:37.737 --> 01:57:38.860 line:82%
That's enough.

1136
01:57:40.151 --> 01:57:42.608 line:82%
10 million pounds?
Why didn't you say so?

1137
01:57:43.358 --> 01:57:46.699 line:82%
Raj, my son!

1138
01:57:46.984 --> 01:57:48.740 line:82%
- Give him the sweets!
- I have some already.

1139
01:57:48.823 --> 01:57:50.271 line:82%
Have some from me.

1140
01:57:50.348 --> 01:57:54.354 line:82%
That's it! You want to build
a factory? We'll get it done.

1141
01:57:56.067 --> 01:57:58.441 line:82%
Get ready for a party
at Baldev's.

1142
01:57:58.524 --> 01:58:01.735 line:82%
- Baldev?
- A dear friend of mine.

1143
01:58:02.443 --> 01:58:05.027 line:82%
Kuljit is marrying his daughter.

1144
01:58:07.674 --> 01:58:11.941 line:82%
- What will I do there?
- He's right. What will he do?

1145
01:58:12.024 --> 01:58:16.361 line:82%
- But if you insist...
- That's my boy!

1146
01:58:17.899 --> 01:58:22.194 line:82%
But Baldev is an English type.
We can't be late.

1147
01:58:22.731 --> 01:58:24.484 line:82%
That's my boy!

1148
01:58:24.859 --> 01:58:27.734 line:82%
Come on. We're always late
because of you.

1149
01:58:28.359 --> 01:58:30.083 line:82%
Kuljit, I need to talk to you.

1150
01:58:30.166 --> 01:58:33.226 line:82%
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.
- Sure, no problem.

1151
01:58:37.355 --> 01:58:39.535 line:82%
I'll have them all. Thank you

1152
01:58:48.691 --> 01:58:50.275 line:82%
Welcome.

1153
01:58:55.316 --> 01:58:56.803 line:82%
My respects, Father-in-law.

1154
01:59:01.413 --> 01:59:02.691 line:82%
Congratulations!

1155
01:59:18.316 --> 01:59:19.400 line:82%
Listen.

1156
01:59:23.388 --> 01:59:24.858 line:82%
The mean shopkeeper.

1157
01:59:26.650 --> 01:59:27.775 line:82%
Hello, how are you?

1158
01:59:28.858 --> 01:59:34.108 line:82%
- I've seen you before.
- Me? I never leave the house.

1159
01:59:34.816 --> 01:59:40.089 line:82%
London? I never got beyond
Ludhiana or the Punjab border.

1160
01:59:40.172 --> 01:59:42.943 line:82%
This is my friend Raj,
just arrived from London.

1161
01:59:45.808 --> 01:59:49.485 line:82%
Oh, here you are, Raj! He saved my
Kuljit's life.

1162
01:59:50.496 --> 01:59:55.027 line:82%
Know who he is? My dearest
and oldest friend, and my in-law.

1163
01:59:56.608 --> 01:59:58.444 line:82%
Don't stare! Pay your respects.

1164
01:59:59.983 --> 02:00:02.864 line:82%
The doctor is waiting to meet you.

1165
02:00:05.153 --> 02:00:07.402 line:82%
The doctor is a gem.

1166
02:00:08.733 --> 02:00:11.022 line:82%
The old geezer has an
amazing memory.

1167
02:00:11.105 --> 02:00:12.634 line:82%
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1168
02:00:12.717 --> 02:00:16.569 line:82%
Amazing! This old mansion
is amazing. Let's go.

1169
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:25.360 line:82%
This is my friend Raj.
He's from London, too.

1170
02:00:26.090 --> 02:00:27.652 line:82%
And this is Simran...

1171
02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:31.860 line:82%
Hello, Simran.

1172
02:00:32.441 --> 02:00:37.569 line:82%
You know, if it wasn't for him,
today we may not...

1173
02:00:38.008 --> 02:00:39.025 line:82%
What are you saying?

1174
02:00:39.108 --> 02:00:41.485 line:82%
Where in London do you stay, Mr. Raj?

1175
02:00:41.941 --> 02:00:42.985 line:82%
Tell her.

1176
02:00:44.608 --> 02:00:49.361 line:82%
- I live in Hampstead, miss...
- Miss Rajeshwari.

1177
02:00:50.816 --> 02:00:54.694 line:82%
I'm very pleased to meet you,
Miss Rajeshwari.

1178
02:00:55.141 --> 02:01:01.528 line:82%
- What's this?
- A small gift for a small bride.

1179
02:01:02.608 --> 02:01:06.486 line:82%
This is so sweet.
Thank you, Mr. Raj.

1180
02:01:06.738 --> 02:01:08.692 line:82%
You're most welcome Miss Rajeshwari.

1181
02:01:10.650 --> 02:01:15.194 line:82%
The people that I like usually
call me Chutki.

1182
02:01:15.733 --> 02:01:17.110 line:82%
Ok, Chutki.

1183
02:01:17.733 --> 02:01:22.861 line:82%
And the people I like
may call me Raj. Just Raj.

1184
02:01:23.233 --> 02:01:25.944 line:82%
- Alright, Raj.
- Alright.

1185
02:01:39.233 --> 02:01:41.319 line:82%
This is my British friend, Raj.

1186
02:01:41.696 --> 02:01:45.193 line:82%
- I told you about him.
- Bless you, son.

1187
02:01:46.631 --> 02:01:49.111 line:82%
- Have some.
- Thank you, Maaji.

1188
02:01:50.725 --> 02:01:52.775 line:82%
Allow me, Maaji. I'll pass it round.

1189
02:01:52.858 --> 02:01:56.162 line:82%
You're from the groom's side.
You're our guest.

1190
02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:58.985 line:82%
You're amazing, Maaji.

1191
02:01:59.528 --> 02:02:03.124 line:82%
First you call me son, now you
treat me as an outsider.

1192
02:02:12.483 --> 02:02:15.903 line:82%
I made the lassi with my own
hands for all the aunties.

1193
02:02:19.108 --> 02:02:21.069 line:82%
I love your sari.

1194
02:02:26.650 --> 02:02:27.901 line:82%
After you.

1195
02:02:36.506 --> 02:02:39.608 line:82%
No! Let the young people do that.

1196
02:02:39.691 --> 02:02:42.108 line:82%
That's what I say, but who listens?

1197
02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.902 line:82%
- They dump all the work on me.
- That's what I say.

1198
02:02:45.941 --> 02:02:48.358 line:82%
- Who are you?
- Me? I'm Raj.

1199
02:02:48.441 --> 02:02:50.110 line:82%
Raj! Raj who?

1200
02:02:50.391 --> 02:02:51.902 line:82%
Your future son-in-law.

1201
02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:55.652 line:82%
Your future son-in-law's
close friend.

1202
02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:58.607 line:82%
Sweet boy! Put it over there.

1203
02:02:59.483 --> 02:03:01.027 line:82%
Sweetheart!

1204
02:03:06.233 --> 02:03:08.027 line:82%
Today is a lucky day.

1205
02:03:08.645 --> 02:03:13.235 line:82%
I saw Simran laugh
for the first time.

1206
02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.069 line:82%
You're right, Mother.

1207
02:03:24.525 --> 02:03:28.971 line:82%
Simran is looking very happy
today. Congratulations.

1208
02:03:40.775 --> 02:03:42.027 line:82%
Sir, beer?

1209
02:03:42.983 --> 02:03:44.736 line:82%
Lassi? This is a lassi, sir...

1210
02:03:46.025 --> 02:03:49.694 line:82%
Sweet lassi? No? Plain, then.

1211
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:59.193 line:82%
Raj, you won't make it.
Book your ticket home.

1212
02:05:04.858 --> 02:05:06.872 line:82%
English boy! Get up.

1213
02:05:07.650 --> 02:05:10.319 line:82%
Aren't you coming? Hunting?

1214
02:05:13.983 --> 02:05:17.200 line:82%
Come off it, Raj. Get up!

1215
02:05:17.283 --> 02:05:19.900 line:82%
I'm ill. I have a fever.

1216
02:05:19.983 --> 02:05:23.402 line:82%
I was so cold last night, I went
to bed with my shoes on.

1217
02:05:23.608 --> 02:05:27.527 line:82%
- You have only one shoe on.
- That's my cold foot.

1218
02:05:27.858 --> 02:05:31.819 line:82%
I'm very sorry I can't go hunting
with you.

1219
02:05:32.233 --> 02:05:35.942 line:82%
Don't worry. You British
are so feeble.

1220
02:05:36.025 --> 02:05:38.775 line:82%
I'll send some medicine.
You'll be better by tonight.

1221
02:05:38.858 --> 02:05:40.317 line:82%
We're having fowl tonight.

1222
02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:41.860 line:82%
Don't worry, you'll be alright.

1223
02:05:43.525 --> 02:05:46.569 line:82%
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

1224
02:05:46.945 --> 02:05:48.235 line:82%
Idiot.

1225
02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:51.481 line:82%
Raj, now you better start.

1226
02:05:53.150 --> 02:05:56.944 line:82%
- What's all this?
- Keep moving.

1227
02:05:59.695 --> 02:06:02.108 line:82%
Something amazing happened.

1228
02:06:02.191 --> 02:06:07.025 line:82%
I happened to bump into Father's
childhood friend.

1229
02:06:07.108 --> 02:06:10.775 line:82%
He gave me all this.
Here, let me hold it.

1230
02:06:10.858 --> 02:06:15.111 line:82%
But what can I do with all this
wheat and sugar?

1231
02:06:15.984 --> 02:06:18.736 line:82%
You're having a wedding.
Might come in handy.

1232
02:06:19.874 --> 02:06:23.069 line:82%
The bride's family can't
accept presents from you.

1233
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:26.525 line:82%
Maaji, not again. Decide.

1234
02:06:26.608 --> 02:06:30.317 line:82%
If you call me "son," then you
must treat me as a son.

1235
02:06:30.861 --> 02:06:33.568 line:82%
- How's that?
- No arguing with sons.

1236
02:06:34.316 --> 02:06:37.110 line:82%
- OK, I won't.
- That's more like it.

1237
02:06:37.661 --> 02:06:41.525 line:82%
Now listen to this.
My mother used to say

1238
02:06:41.608 --> 02:06:45.776 line:82%
boys who help out at weddings
marry lovely brides.

1239
02:06:47.316 --> 02:06:49.860 line:82%
Is that why you're helping?

1240
02:06:50.275 --> 02:06:52.485 line:82%
Only the lucky get
a good bride these days.

1241
02:06:53.191 --> 02:06:54.293 line:82%
What's a good bride?

1242
02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:02.896 line:82%
Let's say this.
She must have shades of you.

1243
02:07:04.525 --> 02:07:06.524 line:82%
Don't tick me off. Bless me.

1244
02:07:06.607 --> 02:07:08.984 line:82%
You'll get the bride
of your choice.

1245
02:07:09.715 --> 02:07:13.068 line:82%
- I must be off.
- Open this for me, please.

1246
02:07:13.275 --> 02:07:14.693 line:82%
Of course, I'll...

1247
02:07:20.311 --> 02:07:24.192 line:82%
Don't think about it too much,
just buy it.

1248
02:07:24.275 --> 02:07:26.617 line:82%
You won't find such workmanship
in Delhi or Mumbai.

1249
02:07:26.893 --> 02:07:30.318 line:82%
All the girls will be jealous
of you.

1250
02:07:30.525 --> 02:07:32.359 line:82%
As for the boys...

1251
02:07:33.025 --> 02:07:34.567 line:82%
It's lovely.

1252
02:07:41.275 --> 02:07:44.943 line:82%
It's not that special.
Show me... that one!

1253
02:07:46.983 --> 02:07:50.608 line:82%
Here, that's a beautiful piece.
Just look at it.

1254
02:07:50.691 --> 02:07:52.811 line:82%
It'll make you glow.

1255
02:07:54.816 --> 02:07:59.172 line:82%
Dreadful saris. I want something
special for the wedding.

1256
02:08:01.566 --> 02:08:03.191 line:82%
Look at this one.

1257
02:08:03.274 --> 02:08:06.526 line:82%
I'll lose my reputation if you
don't look good in this.

1258
02:08:06.899 --> 02:08:10.925 line:82%
Made with real gold thread.
You shimmer.

1259
02:08:11.268 --> 02:08:14.693 line:82%
Stop this nonsense.
I don't like it.

1260
02:08:18.941 --> 02:08:21.944 line:82%
I suppose it's not that bad.

1261
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:23.901 line:82%
I'll keep it.

1262
02:08:29.566 --> 02:08:31.735 line:82%
Pack it. Don't overcharge.

1263
02:08:32.983 --> 02:08:35.284 line:82%
Exhausting, all these saris.

1264
02:08:35.558 --> 02:08:39.944 line:82%
One grain, two grains.
Grain upon grain.

1265
02:08:47.715 --> 02:08:52.194 line:82%
The girl dances on the roof.
The boy is crazy.

1266
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:10.755 line:82%
- Raj, sing us a song.
- I can't sing.

1267
02:09:10.838 --> 02:09:12.745 line:82%
Don't be coy like a girl. Sing.

1268
02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:14.902 line:82%
Go on, sing.

1269
02:09:15.976 --> 02:09:17.069 line:82%
Please.

1270
02:09:18.426 --> 02:09:21.015 line:82%
If you're in love,
what is there to fear?

1271
02:09:21.216 --> 02:09:24.734 line:82%
If you're in love,
what is there to fear?

1272
02:09:35.528 --> 02:09:40.068 line:82%
Live and die by love.
That's all

1273
02:09:46.858 --> 02:09:50.743 line:82%
You eye one girl
and aim at another

1274
02:09:55.358 --> 02:09:57.113 line:82%
Let it drop

1275
02:09:57.196 --> 02:09:59.735 line:82%
What will you sing now?

1276
02:10:07.975 --> 02:10:13.152 line:82%
The brave of heart will come to
take the bride away

1277
02:10:18.191 --> 02:10:23.794 line:82%
And everyone in the house
will be left gawking

1278
02:10:37.818 --> 02:10:41.233 line:82%
- Simran, listen.
- They're sitting right there. Let go.

1279
02:10:41.316 --> 02:10:44.900 line:82%
- On one condition. A kiss, Senorita.
- You nuts?

1280
02:10:44.983 --> 02:10:46.444 line:82%
Just one kiss.

1281
02:10:47.125 --> 02:10:48.568 line:82%
Ma will see us.

1282
02:10:51.173 --> 02:10:52.276 line:82%
Let her.

1283
02:10:54.183 --> 02:10:57.401 line:82%
- Chutki will see us.
- Let her.

1284
02:10:59.733 --> 02:11:02.815 line:82%
- My aunt will see us.
- Let her.

1285
02:11:14.456 --> 02:11:17.561 line:82%
Her dear father will be
the end of me.

1286
02:11:21.233 --> 02:11:24.943 line:82%
Stop thinking, Baldev.
You can't win.

1287
02:11:25.316 --> 02:11:28.943 line:82%
For the first time in 20 years,
I'll beat you.

1288
02:11:30.441 --> 02:11:35.652 line:82%
That was a good move.
I think I've lost this time.

1289
02:11:41.403 --> 02:11:43.576 line:82%
Brilliant!

1290
02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:53.652 line:82%
- I'll put it back.
- Wait. Let me see.

1291
02:11:55.691 --> 02:11:58.933 line:82%
You are a genius. You're not only
genius you're indigenous.

1292
02:12:19.567 --> 02:12:20.570 line:82%
What's wrong?

1293
02:12:23.775 --> 02:12:25.733 line:82%
You know what's happening
tomorrow?

1294
02:12:25.816 --> 02:12:27.694 line:82%
No. What?

1295
02:12:30.025 --> 02:12:32.306 line:82%
I'm getting engaged to Kuljit.

1296
02:12:32.389 --> 02:12:35.118 line:82%
Oh yes! Congratulations.

1297
02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:38.026 line:82%
Be serious Raj.

1298
02:12:41.476 --> 02:12:46.068 line:82%
Kuljit will make me wear
his ring on this finger.

1299
02:12:48.570 --> 02:12:52.423 line:82%
Know why an engagement ring
is worn on this finger?

1300
02:12:56.006 --> 02:12:59.859 line:82%
Because the veins from this finger
go straight to the heart.

1301
02:13:03.276 --> 02:13:06.018 line:82%
I can only wear your ring, Raj.

1302
02:13:06.808 --> 02:13:12.280 line:82%
Want me to put a ring
on your finger in full view?

1303
02:13:12.363 --> 02:13:13.526 line:82%
No problem.

1304
02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:19.069 line:82%
It's all a joke to you. You don't
know what I'm going through.

1305
02:13:19.858 --> 02:13:21.243 line:82%
Look at me.

1306
02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:29.861 line:82%
I understand your suffering
and impatience. Your tears.

1307
02:13:30.983 --> 02:13:33.944 line:82%
But can't you see?
This is only the beginning.

1308
02:13:34.566 --> 02:13:37.361 line:82%
No one knows me well here.

1309
02:13:38.525 --> 02:13:40.776 line:82%
I need more time, Simran.

1310
02:13:41.733 --> 02:13:46.319 line:82%
And I need you to be strong.
I need your laughter.

1311
02:13:48.691 --> 02:13:55.193 line:82%
No idiot can give you a ring
and take you away from me.

1312
02:13:56.858 --> 02:14:00.527 line:82%
You're mine. Only mine.

1313
02:14:08.566 --> 02:14:11.194 line:82%
Chutki will wake up. Go.
Hurry!

1314
02:14:13.441 --> 02:14:14.610 line:82%
Listen.

1315
02:14:38.155 --> 02:14:39.318 line:82%
Sister?

1316
02:14:41.736 --> 02:14:43.193 line:82%
Can I say something?

1317
02:14:45.275 --> 02:14:49.027 line:82%
I really don't like Kuljit.
Don't marry him.

1318
02:14:51.996 --> 02:14:54.003 line:82%
It's late. Go to sleep.

1319
02:14:58.766 --> 02:15:00.788 line:82%
I like the man on the roof.

1320
02:15:12.275 --> 02:15:15.445 line:82%
Isn't Raj the man you met
in Europe?

1321
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:24.841 line:82%
I like him a lot. Marry him.

1322
02:15:26.608 --> 02:15:29.624 line:82%
Don't worry. I'll marry him.

1323
02:15:35.608 --> 02:15:36.818 line:82%
I love you, Sister.

1324
02:15:38.692 --> 02:15:42.111 line:82%
Give these almonds to Ramu
to add to the sherbet.

1325
02:15:44.066 --> 02:15:47.400 line:82%
- Where are the flowers?
- You left them by the stairs.

1326
02:15:47.483 --> 02:15:50.652 line:82%
I forgot. How would we
manage without you?

1327
02:15:51.525 --> 02:15:54.818 line:82%
The brave of heart will win
the bride.

1328
02:15:56.066 --> 02:15:59.997 line:82%
Weren't you on the groom's side?
When did you switch sides?

1329
02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:05.508 line:82%
Hey, pal. I'll get married one day,
so I'm practicing. Get it?

1330
02:16:05.591 --> 02:16:07.985 line:82%
- What the hell!
- Dimwit.

1331
02:16:26.986 --> 02:16:29.569 line:82%
What a lucky fellow Kuljit is!

1332
02:16:36.850 --> 02:16:38.694 line:82%
Now for the ring.

1333
02:16:42.733 --> 02:16:45.027 line:82%
Simran, your hand.

1334
02:16:46.192 --> 02:16:48.527 line:82%
Simran, your hand.

1335
02:16:58.788 --> 02:17:00.068 line:82%
What happened?

1336
02:17:00.892 --> 02:17:05.778 line:82%
I cut my fingers when I took
my bangles off.

1337
02:17:09.524 --> 02:17:10.529 line:82%
Never mind.

1338
02:17:10.816 --> 02:17:12.443 line:82%
The other hand, then.

1339
02:17:22.883 --> 02:17:26.693 line:82%
These girls make your head spin

1340
02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:31.335 line:82%
These boys are just street rascals

1341
02:17:49.983 --> 02:17:54.373 line:82%
Paint your hands with henna.
Decorate the bridal palanquin

1342
02:17:54.977 --> 02:17:59.356 line:82%
Paint your hands with henna.
Decorate the bridal palanquin

1343
02:17:59.946 --> 02:18:04.782 line:82%
Fair girl, your beloved
is coming to take you away

1344
02:18:21.817 --> 02:18:23.629 line:82%
Behind the groom's garland

1345
02:18:24.441 --> 02:18:26.235 line:82%
Hide your face

1346
02:18:31.733 --> 02:18:36.386 line:82%
Keep your feelings hidden
in your heart

1347
02:19:14.475 --> 02:19:19.274 line:82%
As your hair flies in the wind,
what is it trying to tell me?

1348
02:19:19.357 --> 02:19:23.275 line:82%
All these unmarried lovers wait,
heart in hand

1349
02:19:24.233 --> 02:19:29.025 line:82%
Hide the girls in the house,
out of modesty

1350
02:19:29.108 --> 02:19:33.481 line:82%
Our village is overrun by
crazy boys from the city

1351
02:19:33.861 --> 02:19:38.259 line:82%
Don't meet their eye.
Protect your modesty

1352
02:19:43.673 --> 02:19:47.583 line:82%
Fair girl, your beloved is coming
to take you away

1353
02:20:27.653 --> 02:20:32.277 line:82%
I'm a young man.
You're a beautiful girl

1354
02:20:32.633 --> 02:20:36.801 line:82%
If my heart skips a beat,
am I to blame?

1355
02:20:37.359 --> 02:20:42.102 line:82%
Hold onto your heart.
Beauty is sheer magic

1356
02:20:42.328 --> 02:20:46.769 line:82%
If it casts its spell,
am I to blame?

1357
02:20:47.113 --> 02:20:51.437 line:82%
Keep an eye out for me.
Leave the door ajar

1358
02:20:56.985 --> 02:21:01.840 line:82%
Fair girl, your beloved is coming
to take you away

1359
02:21:01.923 --> 02:21:05.862 line:82%
Say nothing more.
Do nothing more

1360
02:21:11.726 --> 02:21:15.819 line:82%
Hide your feelings in your heart

1361
02:22:29.228 --> 02:22:32.028 line:82%
My goddess of beauty

1362
02:22:33.798 --> 02:22:38.233 line:82%
My goddess of beauty,
how unaware you are

1363
02:22:38.316 --> 02:22:42.400 line:82%
That you're still beautiful,
and I am young

1364
02:22:42.693 --> 02:22:47.057 line:82%
I could give my life for you,
my love

1365
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:18.039 line:82%
Paint your hands with henna.
Decorate the bridal palanquin

1366
02:24:27.983 --> 02:24:30.011 line:82%
Father, you were wonderful yesterday.

1367
02:24:30.288 --> 02:24:32.985 line:82%
How you danced!
Outdid them all.

1368
02:24:34.206 --> 02:24:36.027 line:82%
Good, very good.

1369
02:24:45.788 --> 02:24:49.152 line:82%
Just a bit of dirt. It's gone.

1370
02:24:55.310 --> 02:25:00.402 line:82%
Father, aren't there fewer
white doves today?

1371
02:25:03.114 --> 02:25:05.986 line:82%
One, two, three...

1372
02:25:08.173 --> 02:25:10.735 line:82%
No, maybe not.

1373
02:25:31.441 --> 02:25:32.899 line:82%
I've made up my mind.

1374
02:25:32.982 --> 02:25:37.152 line:82%
Today I'll talk to Raj.
Why be embarrassed?

1375
02:25:38.016 --> 02:25:40.854 line:82%
- Raj is here.
- Already?

1376
02:25:41.112 --> 02:25:44.819 line:82%
Raj, my dear boy!
Come and sit down.

1377
02:25:51.195 --> 02:25:55.069 line:82%
Raj, I have something
important to tell you.

1378
02:25:55.758 --> 02:25:58.986 line:82%
Usually this is discussed
with the elders.

1379
02:25:59.066 --> 02:26:03.403 line:82%
But we're so close,
why not talk directly?

1380
02:26:05.141 --> 02:26:08.866 line:82%
I want our friendship
to become kinship.

1381
02:26:09.081 --> 02:26:10.110 line:82%
Why not?

1382
02:26:10.193 --> 02:26:12.364 line:82%
My daughter Preeti...

1383
02:26:12.827 --> 02:26:15.650 line:82%
I want you to marry her.

1384
02:26:19.361 --> 02:26:23.577 line:82%
Raj, old boy, think fast or
you're done for.

1385
02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:25.943 line:82%
Raj, do you have any objections?

1386
02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:29.027 line:82%
How could I?

1387
02:26:32.066 --> 02:26:35.305 line:82%
But I can't decide on my own.
You'll have to talk to Pops.

1388
02:26:35.388 --> 02:26:37.068 line:82%
- Pops?
- My father.

1389
02:26:38.275 --> 02:26:40.609 line:82%
What a good boy he is!

1390
02:26:40.861 --> 02:26:42.947 line:82%
I never do anything
against his wishes.

1391
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:47.652 line:82%
No problem. Give me his number.
I'll phone him.

1392
02:26:50.566 --> 02:26:53.569 line:82%
Actually, he's gone to America
on business.

1393
02:26:54.691 --> 02:26:58.681 line:82%
- I'll ask him to come here
- Why not?

1394
02:27:03.641 --> 02:27:06.400 line:82%
My country! My soil!

1395
02:27:06.483 --> 02:27:09.027 line:82%
Raj, my son. Here I am!

1396
02:27:11.673 --> 02:27:15.110 line:82%
You can find everything
outside of India.

1397
02:27:15.316 --> 02:27:17.944 line:82%
But not your wife's great cooking.

1398
02:27:18.650 --> 02:27:21.515 line:82%
Or our language and culture.

1399
02:27:21.598 --> 02:27:25.403 line:82%
When you love the Ganges,
how can the Thames move you?

1400
02:27:25.705 --> 02:27:29.777 line:82%
I told Raj, "Come back only
when you're married."

1401
02:27:30.566 --> 02:27:33.403 line:82%
Anyway, what do you do
in London?

1402
02:27:34.316 --> 02:27:36.358 line:82%
- In London?
- Forget London.

1403
02:27:36.441 --> 02:27:40.152 line:82%
My philosophy is "Go East,
go West. Punjab is the best."

1404
02:27:47.048 --> 02:27:50.233 line:82%
Don't worry. All is well.
They're very innocent.

1405
02:27:50.316 --> 02:27:52.568 line:82%
I missed you, my son.

1406
02:27:55.691 --> 02:27:57.952 line:82%
You didn't say your daddy
was here?

1407
02:27:58.185 --> 02:28:02.900 line:82%
A miracle! We were talking about
him and I met him at the bazaar.

1408
02:28:02.983 --> 02:28:05.425 line:82%
He had your photo and was looking
for you.

1409
02:28:05.508 --> 02:28:10.361 line:82%
I knew it!
The Lord wants this marriage.

1410
02:28:11.138 --> 02:28:13.150 line:82%
- My in-law.
- In-law?

1411
02:28:13.233 --> 02:28:16.892 line:82%
Of course! Why do you need me to
approve a good deed?

1412
02:28:16.975 --> 02:28:19.650 line:82%
Have I ever refused you anything?

1413
02:28:19.733 --> 02:28:22.443 line:82%
Let's sweeten your
son-in-law's mouth.

1414
02:28:22.983 --> 02:28:26.297 line:82%
Let them marry at once.
Never delay a good deed.

1415
02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:30.235 line:82%
Terrific!
We'll have a double wedding.

1416
02:28:30.775 --> 02:28:32.027 line:82%
So it's settled!

1417
02:28:37.396 --> 02:28:40.027 line:82%
- Happy?
- Yes, Pops.

1418
02:28:40.525 --> 02:28:44.068 line:82%
Let's celebrate.
My son is happy.

1419
02:28:47.038 --> 02:28:52.441 line:82%
So you're marrying Preeti and
Kuljit is Preeti's brother.

1420
02:28:52.524 --> 02:28:55.193 line:82%
And Kuljit is marrying Simran.

1421
02:28:55.815 --> 02:28:59.067 line:82%
But you love Simran, not Preeti.

1422
02:28:59.150 --> 02:29:02.943 line:82%
- So why was Preeti in London?
- Not Preeti. Simran.

1423
02:29:04.275 --> 02:29:05.858 line:82%
Who's Simran?

1424
02:29:05.941 --> 02:29:09.569 line:82%
- Pops, please stop thinking.
- I need to.

1425
02:29:11.094 --> 02:29:14.197 line:82%
Don't worry. I'm here.
I'll sort things out.

1426
02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:17.275 line:82%
Thank you, Pops.
Just like you've done already.

1427
02:29:17.358 --> 02:29:20.692 line:82%
"Let them marry at once.
Never delay a good deed."

1428
02:29:20.775 --> 02:29:24.611 line:82%
- Pops, why did you come?
- I was missing you, son.

1429
02:29:27.673 --> 02:29:30.525 line:82%
OK, I made a mistake. I'll fix it.

1430
02:29:30.608 --> 02:29:35.778 line:82%
I'll say it's the anniversary of
your mother's death, so no wedding.

1431
02:29:38.278 --> 02:29:40.606 line:82%
- Preeti!
- May I come in?

1432
02:29:40.689 --> 02:29:44.482 line:82%
Of course. You will have
a long life.

1433
02:29:44.565 --> 02:29:48.070 line:82%
Raj and I were just talking
about you.

1434
02:29:50.090 --> 02:29:52.319 line:82%
Milk? For me?

1435
02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:55.569 line:82%
Tomorrow is Karwa Chauth.

1436
02:29:56.733 --> 02:29:59.608 line:82%
Can I fast for my future husband?

1437
02:29:59.691 --> 02:30:02.778 line:82%
- Of course. What's the problem?
- A fast for husbands, Pops.

1438
02:30:03.361 --> 02:30:06.819 line:82%
- Oh, no! Never.
- Why not?

1439
02:30:08.151 --> 02:30:12.025 line:82%
In our family, girls fasting before
marriage brings bad luck.

1440
02:30:12.108 --> 02:30:17.194 line:82%
Besides, we can't discuss
the wedding for a month.

1441
02:30:17.441 --> 02:30:22.820 line:82%
This month is the anniversary of
my wife's death.

1442
02:30:23.858 --> 02:30:28.069 line:82%
It's not the right time.
Let's talk to your father.

1443
02:30:35.433 --> 02:30:36.523 line:82%
Simran!

1444
02:30:40.695 --> 02:30:43.994 line:82%
Raj, do you know what tomorrow is?

1445
02:30:46.508 --> 02:30:47.523 line:82%
What now?

1446
02:30:49.215 --> 02:30:51.485 line:82%
My first Karwa Chauth.

1447
02:30:51.995 --> 02:30:56.692 line:82%
I want you to give me a drop of
water and a morsel of food

1448
02:30:56.775 --> 02:30:58.084 line:82%
so I can break the fast.

1449
02:30:58.310 --> 02:31:00.016 line:82%
- Hands off.
- Why?

1450
02:31:00.210 --> 02:31:01.776 line:82%
I said, "hands off."

1451
02:31:05.581 --> 02:31:09.612 line:82%
If you don't love me, just say so
and I will go away quietly.

1452
02:31:09.695 --> 02:31:14.065 line:82%
Then you can marry Kuljit and I'll
be spared these daily scenes.

1453
02:31:14.381 --> 02:31:18.819 line:82%
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, impossible.

1454
02:31:19.233 --> 02:31:23.400 line:82%
"I want you to give me a drop of
water and a morsel of food

1455
02:31:23.483 --> 02:31:24.840 line:82%
to break the fast."

1456
02:31:24.923 --> 02:31:27.455 line:82%
Are you nuts? I say publicly:

1457
02:31:27.538 --> 02:31:31.901 line:82%
"Hi, Simran. I'm your future
husband. Drink the water."

1458
02:31:32.415 --> 02:31:33.592 line:82%
I'll starve to death.

1459
02:31:33.675 --> 02:31:37.525 line:82%
But I'll only take water
and food from you.

1460
02:31:42.663 --> 02:31:44.360 line:82%
Like father, like daughter.

1461
02:31:52.163 --> 02:31:54.193 line:82%
Mr. Malhotra, you're amazing.

1462
02:31:54.891 --> 02:31:58.358 line:82%
No one would guess you're Indian
judging by your clothes.

1463
02:31:58.631 --> 02:32:04.062 line:82%
Don't be fooled by appearances.
I carry India deep in my heart.

1464
02:32:04.301 --> 02:32:08.845 line:82%
Bravo! Such fine thoughts!

1465
02:32:11.611 --> 02:32:15.297 line:82%
I believe you want to start
a factory here.

1466
02:32:15.820 --> 02:32:18.269 line:82%
The factory is just an excuse.

1467
02:32:18.505 --> 02:32:21.678 line:82%
The truth is I came looking
for a wife for Raj.

1468
02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:26.276 line:82%
All the men are hiding behind
the house.

1469
02:32:26.943 --> 02:32:30.610 line:82%
They say today's women's day.
So we can't disturb them.

1470
02:32:31.276 --> 02:32:34.568 line:82%
Are you fasting too, darling?

1471
02:32:38.308 --> 02:32:39.985 line:82%
May you live long, child.

1472
02:32:40.371 --> 02:32:44.402 line:82%
My son is blessed to have
a bride like you.

1473
02:32:46.745 --> 02:32:48.486 line:82%
Careful, children.

1474
02:32:50.175 --> 02:32:52.610 line:82%
This is Pops. I mean, my father.

1475
02:32:54.558 --> 02:32:59.069 line:82%
- Raj has enchanted us all.
- Like father, like son.

1476
02:33:00.631 --> 02:33:02.318 line:82%
I'll be right back.

1477
02:33:06.278 --> 02:33:08.011 line:82%
- Pops, this is...
- I know.

1478
02:33:09.486 --> 02:33:10.968 line:82%
This can only be Simran.

1479
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:24.986 line:82%
Beautiful.

1480
02:33:25.851 --> 02:33:26.936 line:82%
Bless you.

1481
02:33:31.185 --> 02:33:33.860 line:82%
- Pops?
- Excellent, fantastic done. Let's go.

1482
02:33:39.816 --> 02:33:43.069 line:82%
Watch where you're going.
The flowers...

1483
02:33:47.288 --> 02:33:48.527 line:82%
I am sorry.

1484
02:33:49.441 --> 02:33:53.650 line:82%
Oh spring! Shower us with flowers

1485
02:33:53.733 --> 02:33:57.987 line:82%
My beloved is here

1486
02:34:14.151 --> 02:34:16.861 line:82%
Kammo, where are the flowers?
Hurry.

1487
02:34:19.507 --> 02:34:20.693 line:82%
Excuse me.

1488
02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:24.862 line:82%
I'm Raj's father, from London.

1489
02:34:26.183 --> 02:34:30.279 line:82%
Born in Bhatinda but lived in
London for years. And you?

1490
02:34:31.418 --> 02:34:33.736 line:82%
- I'm Simran's aunt.
- Impossible!

1491
02:34:34.171 --> 02:34:36.277 line:82%
You look like her sister.

1492
02:34:39.193 --> 02:34:41.444 line:82%
Aren't you fasting?

1493
02:34:42.983 --> 02:34:46.194 line:82%
- I'm not married.
- That's great news.

1494
02:34:47.066 --> 02:34:48.611 line:82%
Your flower.

1495
02:34:49.858 --> 02:34:54.403 line:82%
Perhaps it was meant for you.
You keep it.

1496
02:35:07.705 --> 02:35:11.817 line:82%
Raj, when will the moon rise?
I'm starving.

1497
02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:14.317 line:82%
Starving? I told you not to fast.

1498
02:35:20.766 --> 02:35:23.235 line:82%
Eat, no one's watching.

1499
02:35:23.715 --> 02:35:25.873 line:82%
- Stop it!
- Don't eat.

1500
02:35:28.705 --> 02:35:32.776 line:82%
Hey, Simran. The moon is out.
Look over there.

1501
02:36:02.275 --> 02:36:05.696 line:82%
In her eyes, a prayer

1502
02:36:07.455 --> 02:36:11.321 line:82%
A prayer for her husband's
long life

1503
02:36:13.733 --> 02:36:18.862 line:82%
To see the moon,
I fold my hands in prayer

1504
02:36:19.066 --> 02:36:23.047 line:82%
To break the fast of
Karwa Chauth

1505
02:36:25.888 --> 02:36:31.642 line:82%
When I drink the water you offer,
this devotee will become your queen

1506
02:36:31.725 --> 02:36:36.730 line:82%
Whatever you pray for tonight
will be yours

1507
02:36:36.933 --> 02:36:41.929 line:82%
Oh stranger, come home.
Your country is calling you

1508
02:36:53.873 --> 02:36:56.653 line:82%
What's wrong?
Hurry, some water.

1509
02:37:02.703 --> 02:37:05.703 line:82%
- What's wrong?
- She was a bit dizzy.

1510
02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:09.445 line:82%
Come, child.

1511
02:37:12.191 --> 02:37:15.486 line:82%
- What happened?
- She was just a little dizzy.

1512
02:37:17.423 --> 02:37:20.351 line:82%
Come on, brothers. Let's eat.

1513
02:37:22.746 --> 02:37:25.111 line:82%
She's so delicate, poor thing.

1514
02:37:27.526 --> 02:37:29.812 line:82%
What's wrong?
Are you fasting, too?

1515
02:37:30.068 --> 02:37:32.437 line:82%
- No way.
- Then come along.

1516
02:37:34.006 --> 02:37:36.557 line:82%
It isn't easy for him to come.

1517
02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:41.153 line:82%
They don't let Raj out of their sight.

1518
02:37:41.466 --> 02:37:44.983 line:82%
He won't come. Please, eat.

1519
02:37:45.066 --> 02:37:47.736 line:82%
No. I'd rather starve to death.

1520
02:37:48.433 --> 02:37:51.069 line:82%
Very well, then.
Don't eat. Die.

1521
02:37:58.816 --> 02:38:00.819 line:82%
I am sorry. Hi, Chutki.

1522
02:38:01.016 --> 02:38:05.233 line:82%
Sorry, I'm late. What could I do?
They wouldn't let me go.

1523
02:38:05.316 --> 02:38:08.862 line:82%
It was hell getting away.
Please eat.

1524
02:38:09.225 --> 02:38:10.610 line:82%
Eat, Sister.

1525
02:38:13.631 --> 02:38:18.153 line:82%
I said I'm sorry. Now eat
or you'll faint for real.

1526
02:38:21.643 --> 02:38:26.569 line:82%
Chutki, please tell him
not to worry about me.

1527
02:38:27.141 --> 02:38:29.608 line:82%
When I was dying of hunger.

1528
02:38:29.691 --> 02:38:33.653 line:82%
he was eating to
his heart's content.

1529
02:38:34.308 --> 02:38:37.233 line:82%
Besides, it's my first
Karwa Chauth.

1530
02:38:37.316 --> 02:38:41.486 line:82%
Is he bothered? What's it to him
if I live or die?

1531
02:38:41.725 --> 02:38:46.234 line:82%
Oh God, Sister. Raj hasn't
eaten since this morning.

1532
02:38:46.725 --> 02:38:51.942 line:82%
He said he'd eat with you, and
made me promise not to tell.

1533
02:38:52.025 --> 02:38:54.590 line:82%
Sorry, Raj. I couldn't keep quiet
any longer.

1534
02:39:04.871 --> 02:39:05.985 line:82%
Come here.

1535
02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:08.985 line:82%
Are you talking to me?

1536
02:39:26.663 --> 02:39:30.609 line:82%
- I said too much in anger.
- Don't worry, Senorita.

1537
02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:34.695 line:82%
In big countries such small
things do happen.

1538
02:39:41.755 --> 02:39:44.344 line:82%
It's my turn. You feed me now.

1539
02:40:04.601 --> 02:40:07.652 line:82%
I told you not to betray me.

1540
02:40:15.288 --> 02:40:18.382 line:82%
My daughter will not suffer
what I suffered.

1541
02:40:18.465 --> 02:40:23.017 line:82%
She will not make sacrifices either
as a daughter, sister or wife.

1542
02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:27.044 line:82%
She'll live her life as she pleases.
Find happiness.

1543
02:40:33.232 --> 02:40:34.318 line:82%
Come in.

1544
02:41:00.478 --> 02:41:01.609 line:82%
Take this.

1545
02:41:03.275 --> 02:41:04.860 line:82%
I won't hear a word.

1546
02:41:05.858 --> 02:41:10.237 line:82%
I know everything. I've seen
everything I need to see.

1547
02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:14.146 line:82%
I know Raj is the boy
you met in Europe.

1548
02:41:14.983 --> 02:41:17.923 line:82%
I also know you love each other
very much.

1549
02:41:18.858 --> 02:41:20.570 line:82%
I was wrong, Simran.

1550
02:41:21.381 --> 02:41:27.104 line:82%
My daughter will not sacrifice
her happiness or her love.

1551
02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:34.444 line:82%
Raj, I know you'll make
her happy.

1552
02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:39.327 line:82%
You both have my blessings.
Take my daughter away.

1553
02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:40.973 line:82%
Go away.

1554
02:41:41.816 --> 02:41:44.819 line:82%
No one here will understand
your love.

1555
02:41:45.941 --> 02:41:47.023 line:82%
Take her away.

1556
02:41:48.631 --> 02:41:50.193 line:82%
I'll take care of things here.

1557
02:41:50.987 --> 02:41:53.027 line:82%
I won't hear a word.

1558
02:41:53.566 --> 02:41:57.277 line:82%
Go, before I weaken.

1559
02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:00.453 line:82%
Please go.

1560
02:42:01.025 --> 02:42:05.528 line:82%
- I implore you, take her away.
- I'll take her away, Maaji.

1561
02:42:10.131 --> 02:42:11.819 line:82%
Please sit, Maaji.

1562
02:42:14.233 --> 02:42:15.610 line:82%
Here.

1563
02:42:20.941 --> 02:42:23.527 line:82%
I was very young when
my mother died.

1564
02:42:24.691 --> 02:42:27.611 line:82%
But I owe what I am today
to her.

1565
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:31.819 line:82%
She told me something
I've never forgotten.

1566
02:42:32.538 --> 02:42:38.153 line:82%
She said: "Son, at every turn
in life, you'll find two paths.

1567
02:42:38.581 --> 02:42:41.152 line:82%
The right and the wrong path.

1568
02:42:42.048 --> 02:42:45.945 line:82%
The wrong path is the easy one.
It'll draw you to it.

1569
02:42:46.525 --> 02:42:50.944 line:82%
The right path will be strewn
with difficulties.

1570
02:42:52.441 --> 02:42:54.652 line:82%
If you take the wrong path,

1571
02:42:55.233 --> 02:42:59.153 line:82%
at first you'll be rewarded
with success and joy.

1572
02:43:00.183 --> 02:43:03.528 line:82%
But in the end, you'll be
the loser.

1573
02:43:04.590 --> 02:43:06.861 line:82%
If you take the right path

1574
02:43:07.818 --> 02:43:13.069 line:82%
at every step you'll be faced
with hardship and trouble.

1575
02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:18.652 line:82%
But in the end, you'll be
the winner."

1576
02:43:22.066 --> 02:43:23.610 line:82%
Tell me, Maaji.

1577
02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:29.537 line:82%
Is my path the right one
or the wrong one?

1578
02:43:33.631 --> 02:43:36.111 line:82%
Yours is the right path, son.

1579
02:43:37.766 --> 02:43:39.791 line:82%
But you don't know my husband.

1580
02:43:42.174 --> 02:43:46.619 line:82%
Maaji, your husband doesn't
know me.

1581
02:43:48.775 --> 02:43:53.987 line:82%
If I'd wanted to elope with Simran,
I'd have done it by now.

1582
02:43:55.433 --> 02:43:59.694 line:82%
But I don't want to snatch her away.
I want to win her.

1583
02:44:00.566 --> 02:44:05.487 line:82%
I don't want to steal her. I want us
to leave with our heads held high.

1584
02:44:06.441 --> 02:44:11.362 line:82%
Now I'm here, I'll take my bride
away with me.

1585
02:44:12.316 --> 02:44:13.987 line:82%
But I'll only leave

1586
02:44:14.775 --> 02:44:19.737 line:82%
when her father gives me
her hand.

1587
02:44:21.558 --> 02:44:24.986 line:82%
Simran is not your problem
any more. She's mine.

1588
02:44:25.691 --> 02:44:28.570 line:82%
You've said goodbye to
your daughter.

1589
02:44:29.415 --> 02:44:33.168 line:82%
Now let the bridal palanquin depart.

1590
02:44:44.650 --> 02:44:46.201 line:82%
Excuse me.

1591
02:44:46.284 --> 02:44:50.485 line:82%
Does this crying disorder
run in the family?

1592
02:44:59.923 --> 02:45:01.609 line:82%
Good shot, my God.

1593
02:45:02.038 --> 02:45:04.740 line:82%
Kuljeet, now that we are friends

1594
02:45:04.823 --> 02:45:06.642 line:82%
I hope you won't mind if I tell
you something.

1595
02:45:06.725 --> 02:45:08.560 line:82%
Go ahead, Uncle.

1596
02:45:08.643 --> 02:45:12.858 line:82%
That girl... what's her name?
Ah, Simran!

1597
02:45:12.941 --> 02:45:16.085 line:82%
You're not a good match,
to be very frank with you.

1598
02:45:16.168 --> 02:45:20.032 line:82%
- Why not, Uncle?
- She doesn't deserve you.

1599
02:45:20.115 --> 02:45:23.797 line:82%
You're a strong young man
from Punjab.

1600
02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:28.678 line:82%
That girl is too quiet and shy.
Not a good match.

1601
02:45:29.108 --> 02:45:32.692 line:82%
You need a feisty girl.
Real feisty.

1602
02:45:32.775 --> 02:45:37.985 line:82%
Come to London. I'll introduce you
to real sparklers. You'll go nuts.

1603
02:45:39.316 --> 02:45:41.259 line:82%
No problem, Uncle.

1604
02:45:41.405 --> 02:45:44.692 line:82%
After I marry Simran
she'll stay here

1605
02:45:44.775 --> 02:45:48.944 line:82%
and I'll come to London
to meet the sparklers.

1606
02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:53.400 line:82%
Two birds, one in hand, one in the bush.

1607
02:45:53.483 --> 02:45:58.071 line:82%
- We'll raise hell.
- Like hell you will, you fool!

1608
02:46:04.195 --> 02:46:09.027 line:82%
I was very young when my father
sat me on his shoulders

1609
02:46:09.691 --> 02:46:12.194 line:82%
and brought me to these fields.

1610
02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:16.278 line:82%
I've been friends with
the pigeons ever since.

1611
02:46:17.661 --> 02:46:20.110 line:82%
I feel at peace here.

1612
02:46:21.358 --> 02:46:26.318 line:82%
I love spending time
with these pigeons.

1613
02:46:28.151 --> 02:46:30.028 line:82%
Tell me something, Father.

1614
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:35.444 line:82%
Are these pigeons different
from the ones in London?

1615
02:46:41.041 --> 02:46:42.694 line:82%
There's a difference.

1616
02:46:43.310 --> 02:46:48.403 line:82%
These pigeons know me.
They belong to my land.

1617
02:46:49.445 --> 02:46:52.111 line:82%
In London, they're strangers.

1618
02:46:52.816 --> 02:46:57.361 line:82%
Maybe the difference lies
in your perception.

1619
02:46:59.441 --> 02:47:03.944 line:82%
One of those London pigeons
might have flown from here.

1620
02:47:04.558 --> 02:47:09.551 line:82%
It comes from your land.
It knows you.

1621
02:47:11.735 --> 02:47:13.816 line:82%
But perhaps you can't
recognize it.

1622
02:47:23.550 --> 02:47:24.735 line:82%
What's happened?

1623
02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:30.777 line:82%
What are you doing?

1624
02:47:31.871 --> 02:47:37.236 line:82%
My mother always said our country's
soil is very strong. It'll be fine.

1625
02:47:37.923 --> 02:47:40.903 line:82%
But who did this insane thing?

1626
02:47:44.330 --> 02:47:45.490 line:82%
Kuljit?

1627
02:47:45.806 --> 02:47:48.809 line:82%
Look, Father.

1628
02:47:56.018 --> 02:47:57.235 line:82%
Let's go.

1629
02:48:00.413 --> 02:48:03.152 line:82%
Are you still angry about
that beer incident?

1630
02:48:05.391 --> 02:48:08.952 line:82%
It was a folly of youth.
Forgive me.

1631
02:48:10.983 --> 02:48:12.690 line:82%
I've forgotten all about it.

1632
02:48:14.245 --> 02:48:16.569 line:82%
I was wrong about you.

1633
02:48:17.361 --> 02:48:21.924 line:82%
You're right. Maybe I didn't
recognize it.

1634
02:48:28.066 --> 02:48:29.195 line:82%
Sorry.

1635
02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:40.153 line:82%
What's wrong, Mother? You called me.

1636
02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:47.075 line:82%
The doctor may say what he wants,

1637
02:48:47.886 --> 02:48:50.151 line:82%
but I know my time is up.

1638
02:48:50.683 --> 02:48:54.483 line:82%
Don't say such inauspicious things,
Mother.

1639
02:48:54.566 --> 02:48:59.111 line:82%
Nothing to worry about.
It's time to leave.

1640
02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:05.986 line:82%
I've had a wonderful life.

1641
02:49:08.475 --> 02:49:11.153 line:82%
I have no complaints, dear.

1642
02:49:12.108 --> 02:49:15.986 line:82%
But now that I've seen Simran

1643
02:49:17.066 --> 02:49:21.486 line:82%
a wish fills my heart.

1644
02:49:23.601 --> 02:49:27.861 line:82%
I want to see my granddaughter
as a bride.

1645
02:49:29.131 --> 02:49:32.986 line:82%
I hope I don't die
before she marries.

1646
02:49:33.266 --> 02:49:36.445 line:82%
Don't say that, Mother.

1647
02:49:40.465 --> 02:49:42.278 line:82%
The bridal palanquin

1648
02:49:42.483 --> 02:49:45.486 line:82%
needs only to go from one
neighboring house to another.

1649
02:49:45.941 --> 02:49:48.111 line:82%
And you're all here with me.

1650
02:49:48.955 --> 02:49:54.640 line:82%
Don't wait another week.
Can't they marry tomorrow?

1651
02:49:54.893 --> 02:49:58.894 line:82%
You're right. Let them
marry tomorrow.

1652
02:49:58.977 --> 02:50:01.010 line:82%
Isn't it, Baldev? The wedding
procession will come tomorrow.

1653
02:50:01.093 --> 02:50:02.238 line:82%
- Yes, Mom.
- Tomorrow.

1654
02:50:02.321 --> 02:50:03.628 line:82%
It'll come tomorrow only.

1655
02:50:13.816 --> 02:50:15.511 line:82%
We must take Simran away.

1656
02:50:18.153 --> 02:50:19.777 line:82%
There's no other way.

1657
02:50:20.941 --> 02:50:23.110 line:82%
I've got it all planned.

1658
02:50:23.381 --> 02:50:25.330 line:82%
We'll take the morning train.

1659
02:50:25.735 --> 02:50:30.233 line:82%
I'll get the tickets and wait
for you. Bring Simran somehow.

1660
02:50:30.316 --> 02:50:32.027 line:82%
We'll face whatever happens later.

1661
02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:34.818 line:82%
Are you listening?

1662
02:50:36.591 --> 02:50:40.818 line:82%
I know you don't want to
take Simran like this.

1663
02:50:41.316 --> 02:50:42.985 line:82%
But it's too late now.

1664
02:50:43.476 --> 02:50:47.319 line:82%
If you love her and want
to marry her

1665
02:50:47.566 --> 02:50:50.777 line:82%
you'll have to elope, understand?

1666
02:50:52.650 --> 02:50:53.652 line:82%
Good.

1667
02:50:59.233 --> 02:51:01.565 line:82%
Take me away from here, Raj.

1668
02:51:01.891 --> 02:51:06.495 line:82%
You don't know my father, Raj.
We'll have to elope.

1669
02:51:07.141 --> 02:51:09.693 line:82%
I came here to make you
my bride.

1670
02:51:10.090 --> 02:51:14.971 line:82%
I'll only take you away when
your father gives me your hand.

1671
02:51:15.775 --> 02:51:18.569 line:82%
I don't know what will
happen tomorrow.

1672
02:51:22.399 --> 02:51:26.527 line:82%
I myself don't know what
I'm going to do.

1673
02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:33.027 line:82%
But you'll have to trust me.

1674
02:51:36.816 --> 02:51:38.860 line:82%
Whatever I do tomorrow

1675
02:51:42.233 --> 02:51:43.705 line:82%
it'll be for both of us.

1676
02:51:49.766 --> 02:51:50.912 line:82%
Do you love me?

1677
02:51:53.858 --> 02:51:55.079 line:82%
Do you trust me?

1678
02:51:58.685 --> 02:52:03.027 line:82%
All that's left is for the bridal
palanquin to depart.

1679
02:52:13.108 --> 02:52:16.949 line:82%
Oh, my friend

1680
02:52:21.025 --> 02:52:23.612 line:82%
Oh, my love

1681
02:52:29.525 --> 02:52:32.195 line:82%
I give you

1682
02:52:36.316 --> 02:52:40.364 line:82%
into the hands of God

1683
02:53:00.108 --> 02:53:02.650 line:82%
How strange are the ways
of the world

1684
02:53:02.733 --> 02:53:05.808 line:82%
How many blows our crazy hearts
must suffer

1685
02:53:05.891 --> 02:53:11.050 line:82%
What is left for me to hear or say?
Let our feelings stay unspoken

1686
02:53:15.650 --> 02:53:18.192 line:82%
No more hide and seek

1687
02:53:18.275 --> 02:53:21.152 line:82%
Tomorrow my bridal palanquin
will depart

1688
02:53:26.650 --> 02:53:31.403 line:82%
Is it the start or end of life?

1689
02:53:31.691 --> 02:53:36.694 line:82%
Simi, come. It's time for
the Mehndi ceremony.

1690
02:55:08.644 --> 02:55:12.692 line:82%
Father, I was going to tell you...

1691
02:55:15.983 --> 02:55:21.204 line:82%
You were right. It was I
who didn't recognize you.

1692
02:55:23.580 --> 02:55:25.860 line:82%
You've snuck into my home.

1693
02:55:26.650 --> 02:55:28.861 line:82%
Among my family.

1694
02:55:29.566 --> 02:55:32.204 line:82%
And played with my honor.

1695
02:55:33.818 --> 02:55:35.860 line:82%
You deceived me.

1696
02:55:36.275 --> 02:55:38.319 line:82%
You abused my trust.

1697
02:55:39.025 --> 02:55:41.309 line:82%
You mocked our decency.

1698
02:55:42.983 --> 02:55:46.317 line:82%
How dare you love Simran?

1699
02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:51.395 line:82%
How can you be worthy of her when
you're unworthy yourself?

1700
02:55:53.691 --> 02:55:56.275 line:82%
I was right about you.

1701
02:55:56.358 --> 02:56:00.650 line:82%
Scoundrels and liars like you
never change. They get worse.

1702
02:56:13.858 --> 02:56:16.442 line:82%
Didn't I tell you to
take me away?

1703
02:56:16.525 --> 02:56:19.694 line:82%
Didn't I say no one here
would understand our love?

1704
02:56:20.150 --> 02:56:22.068 line:82%
Didn't I tell you we must run?

1705
02:56:22.151 --> 02:56:25.002 line:82%
No, Simran. No.

1706
02:56:26.108 --> 02:56:28.234 line:82%
You can run away from strangers.

1707
02:56:29.892 --> 02:56:33.903 line:82%
But if you run away from your own,
where would you run to?

1708
02:56:40.459 --> 02:56:42.401 line:82%
They're our elders.

1709
02:56:43.621 --> 02:56:45.193 line:82%
Our parents.

1710
02:56:47.358 --> 02:56:50.902 line:82%
They spend their lives
raising us.

1711
02:56:51.816 --> 02:56:54.236 line:82%
They give us boundless love.

1712
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:59.777 line:82%
They can decide things for us
better then we can.

1713
02:57:01.608 --> 02:57:07.386 line:82%
We've no right to make them suffer
for the sake of our happiness.

1714
02:57:13.941 --> 02:57:15.777 line:82%
Father is right.

1715
02:57:17.858 --> 02:57:21.569 line:82%
I'm a liar and a cheat.

1716
02:57:24.775 --> 02:57:28.319 line:82%
So what if I lied to win you?

1717
02:57:29.983 --> 02:57:32.361 line:82%
A lie is still a lie.

1718
02:57:36.066 --> 02:57:37.777 line:82%
Father is right.

1719
02:57:40.233 --> 02:57:42.068 line:82%
I'm unworthy of you.

1720
02:57:44.858 --> 02:57:48.943 line:82%
So what if I see no one else
but you?

1721
02:57:51.275 --> 02:57:55.527 line:82%
So what if yours is the only name
I recall?

1722
02:57:57.525 --> 02:58:01.652 line:82%
Father is right. I am a good-for-nothing.

1723
02:58:04.066 --> 02:58:07.611 line:82%
How did I imagine that
I could marry you?

1724
02:58:09.942 --> 02:58:13.902 line:82%
So what if this good-for-nothing
loves you madly?

1725
02:58:23.400 --> 02:58:25.137 line:82%
Love isn't everything.

1726
02:58:29.191 --> 02:58:31.069 line:82%
Father is right, Simran.

1727
02:58:33.191 --> 02:58:34.443 line:82%
Father is right.

1728
02:58:42.096 --> 02:58:46.819 line:82%
Here, Father.
I return what's yours.

1729
02:59:00.608 --> 02:59:04.027 line:82%
I didn't come here to break
anyone's heart.

1730
02:59:05.900 --> 02:59:07.943 line:82%
I came to win a heart.

1731
02:59:11.525 --> 02:59:14.194 line:82%
There must be something
lacking in me

1732
02:59:14.441 --> 02:59:16.777 line:82%
if I couldn't win your heart.

1733
02:59:19.983 --> 02:59:24.153 line:82%
If you think Kuljit will make
Simran happier than I can,

1734
02:59:28.733 --> 02:59:30.443 line:82%
then you must be right.

1735
02:59:32.816 --> 02:59:37.648 line:82%
You, better than anyone,
know what's best for Simran.

1736
02:59:42.150 --> 02:59:45.610 line:82%
Forgive me, Father.

1737
03:00:43.941 --> 03:00:45.902 line:82%
Forgive me, Preeti.

1738
03:00:47.525 --> 03:00:49.763 line:82%
I know I hurt you.

1739
03:01:43.025 --> 03:01:46.027 line:82%
Raj, where is Simran?

1740
03:01:49.191 --> 03:01:50.860 line:82%
She will come, Pops.

1741
03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:56.729 line:82%
Her father will bring her.

1742
03:01:57.816 --> 03:01:59.902 line:82%
He'll have to.

1743
03:02:24.775 --> 03:02:29.027 line:82%
I won't hear another word.
Go away.

1744
03:02:29.566 --> 03:02:33.902 line:82%
Your son has deceived us all.
Showed us his true colors.

1745
03:02:34.108 --> 03:02:37.243 line:82%
- I won't let a liar...
- Enough!

1746
03:02:40.608 --> 03:02:42.610 line:82%
My son is my pride.

1747
03:02:43.316 --> 03:02:44.988 line:82%
Don't insult my pride.

1748
03:04:02.108 --> 03:04:08.194 line:82%
They're fighting at the station.
Someone might get killed.

1749
03:04:08.485 --> 03:04:10.652 line:82%
Stop them. Please come.

1750
03:04:18.983 --> 03:04:21.021 line:82%
Simran, come with me.

1751
03:05:14.275 --> 03:05:15.777 line:82%
Stop it!

1752
03:06:52.858 --> 03:06:55.916 line:82%
Let me go, Father. Let me go.

1753
03:06:59.398 --> 03:07:03.568 line:82%
Raj is my life, Father.
I can't live without him.

1754
03:07:03.900 --> 03:07:05.990 line:82%
Let me go to my Raj.

1755
03:07:10.358 --> 03:07:12.569 line:82%
Father, please I beg of you.

1756
03:07:31.233 --> 03:07:32.557 line:82%
Go, Simran.

1757
03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:40.065 line:82%
No one could ever love you
more than this boy.

1758
03:07:41.316 --> 03:07:43.069 line:82%
Go, child. Go.

1759
03:07:43.608 --> 03:07:45.257 line:82%
Go to your Raj.

1760
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:47.350 line:82%
Go, Simran.

1761
03:07:47.698 --> 03:07:49.412 line:82%
Go, live your life.

1762
03:08:49.734 --> 03:08:52.527 line:82%
- I am sorry.
- It's alright, Senorita.

1763
03:08:53.071 --> 03:08:56.902 line:82%
In big countries such small things
do happen.

1764
03:09:00.399 --> 03:09:05.527 line:82%
The brave of heart always win
the bride.

1765
03:09:08.650 --> 03:09:12.007 line:82%
When I saw you I knew,
my beloved

1766
03:09:13.733 --> 03:09:16.448 line:82%
Love is a crazy thing

1767
03:09:28.607 --> 03:09:31.688 line:82%
Where do I go from here?

1768
03:09:33.956 --> 03:09:38.777 line:82%
I could just die in your arms
