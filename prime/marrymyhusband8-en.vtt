00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.505 line:80%
Your necklace.

3
00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:47.840 line:80%
It's really pretty.

4
00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:55.973 line:80%
Let's go.

5
00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.859 line:80%
The flag is just down here.

6
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:08.652 line:80%
Flag one.

7
00:01:09.904 --> 00:01:10.863 line:80%
What?

8
00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:12.448 line:80%
-What's that?
-What?

9
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.995 line:80%
I think someone already got it.

10
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.601 line:80%
Goodness.

11
00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.645 line:80%
You're incredible.

12
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.564 line:80%
I wondered who'd dare go in there.

13
00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:46.816 line:80%
It was you?

14
00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:49.235 line:80%
You're incredible.

15
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:53.823 line:80%
I want to be solid land.

16
00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:56.617 line:80%
-Hui-yeon.
-Yeah?

17
00:01:57.993 --> 00:02:00.788 line:80%
What does it mean
when someone wants to be land?

18
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:06.252 line:80%
Like when asked what you want to become
or do in the future.

19
00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:09.547 line:80%
Maybe they meant lamb?

20
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:11.757 line:80%
Oh, man. Now I'm hungry.

21
00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:17.263 line:80%
Maybe it was something else.

22
00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:19.890 line:80%
Who said it? You should just ask them.

23
00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:21.809 line:80%
Well...

24
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:25.145 line:80%
It's hard to ask them.

25
00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:26.939 line:80%
Is it Mr. Park?

26
00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.359 line:80%
You shouldn't be like that.

27
00:02:30.943 --> 00:02:36.907 line:80%
My husband said things I never understood,
and I couldn't ask him too.

28
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.910 line:80%
Especially between lovers,

29
00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:42.746 line:80%
you should share
future goals or bucket lists!

30
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.250 line:80%
You won the camper today.

31
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.129 line:80%
Sneak him into your car and ask him.

32
00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:53.757 line:80%
What are you saying? So dirty!

33
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.092 line:80%
Married women are so...

34
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.970 line:80%
I can't do that.

35
00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.140 line:80%
Min-hwan can't be with me tonight.

36
00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.731 line:80%
In the past, I got number four
which was the single tent,

37
00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:11.066 line:80%
and Su-min got number one, the camper.

38
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:13.027 line:80%
And that night...

39
00:03:14.987 --> 00:03:18.866 line:80%
Hey, I can't sleep in a sleeping bag.

40
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.993 line:80%
Let's go sleep somewhere else.

41
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.537 line:80%
We left and came back at dawn.

42
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:25.414 line:80%
I'll die if I sleep here.

43
00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:29.084 line:80%
We drank so we were overheated.
It was horrifying.

44
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:30.586 line:80%
Hey.

45
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.256 line:80%
-Hey!
-If I'm in the camper,

46
00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:40.012 line:80%
Su-min will be in the single tent.

47
00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:42.848 line:80%
If so...

48
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.769 line:80%
Today could be D-Day.

49
00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:47.728 line:80%
What?

50
00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:50.314 line:80%
Nothing.

51
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.942 line:80%
I should go out.

52
00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:54.485 line:80%
You're going out again?

53
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.363 line:80%
You found the number one. Just rest.

54
00:03:57.446 --> 00:04:00.407 line:80%
We still have time.
I have to follow the rules.

55
00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.535 line:80%
Goodness.

56
00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.204 line:80%
She's so inflexible.

57
00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.633 line:80%
That was dangerous and reckless.

58
00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:22.596 line:80%
I know I won't die from drowning.

59
00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.642 line:80%
What scares me the most

60
00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:31.230 line:80%
is living the same life as before
with this second chance.

61
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:36.610 line:80%
In order to not do that,
I can do anything.

62
00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.836 line:80%
So since you have the number one flag,

63
00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.129 line:80%
has fate changed?

64
00:04:55.963 --> 00:05:01.051 line:80%
Or is there a chance that Su-min will
take it before you sleep in the camper?

65
00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.220 line:80%
I don't know.

66
00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:05.139 line:80%
Then...

67
00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.517 line:80%
But there's one thing that's certain.

68
00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:12.396 line:80%
Park Min-hwan borrowed money from me,

69
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.150 line:80%
and he bought a necklace
before coming here.

70
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.070 line:80%
He's simple-minded.

71
00:05:20.154 --> 00:05:23.282 line:80%
It's his killer move
to get into a woman's pants.

72
00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.452 line:80%
I got it too.

73
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.958 line:80%
It's so pretty, babe.

74
00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:34.501 line:80%
It's nothing much.

75
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.632 line:80%
Are you saying
he bought the same necklace?

76
00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:43.218 line:80%
No, it's a bit different. This one...

77
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.096 line:80%
It looked quite expensive.

78
00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.849 line:80%
I must've been easier to him.

79
00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:55.731 line:80%
It's okay.

80
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.650 line:80%
I'm doing all this to escape
someone like him.

81
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:03.781 line:80%
I'll only take what's good.

82
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.911 line:80%
You should.

83
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:11.288 line:80%
That's how you'll make today D-Day?

84
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:15.084 line:80%
Yes. First, I'll make sure
Su-min gets number four.

85
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:18.337 line:80%
Then I'll get Min-hwan wasted.

86
00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:22.007 line:80%
Okay, I'll be rooting for you.

87
00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:23.300 line:80%
As much as I can.

88
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.469 line:80%
Okay, I'll root for...

89
00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:30.516 line:80%
By the way, what did you say
you wanted to be earlier?

90
00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:34.228 line:80%
Lamb? Lamp?

91
00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:38.524 line:80%
What was it? Or maybe champ?

92
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:41.443 line:80%
Was that it?

93
00:06:41.527 --> 00:06:43.237 line:80%
Not me! Get someone else!

94
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.072 line:80%
Can't you get someone else?

95
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.573 line:80%
Someone else!

96
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.703 line:80%
You're out.

97
00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.546 line:80%
Who the heck has number one?

98
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.757 line:80%
No one here would go in the water.

99
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.184 line:80%
Except for Ji-won.

100
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.651 line:80%
I've never had nice things before,
so protecting this is so hard.

101
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:55.851 line:80%
Sorry, Ji-won!

102
00:08:01.732 --> 00:08:02.774 line:80%
Let go!

103
00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:05.277 line:80%
You scared me!

104
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.695 line:80%
My bracelet's stuck!

105
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.947 line:80%
Be still. Don't move.

106
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:10.616 line:80%
That hurts!

107
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:20.584 line:80%
Are you mad?

108
00:08:23.212 --> 00:08:24.421 line:80%
This is just a game.

109
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:28.926 line:80%
And this wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't tried to get me.

110
00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:04.753 line:80%
What's wrong with me?

111
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.630 line:80%
Why am I worried?

112
00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:40.622 line:80%
Ji-won, you're out!

113
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.921 line:80%
I knew you'd come back.

114
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.134 line:80%
Did you really go into the water?

115
00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.803 line:80%
So this is why you impress everyone.

116
00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.596 line:80%
Find someone who's glamping.

117
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.223 line:80%
Thanks for this.

118
00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:03.979 line:80%
Hello, everyone.

119
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.898 line:80%
I hope you're having fun.

120
00:10:06.982 --> 00:10:10.777 line:80%
Anyway, I didn't know
you'd all participate so enthusiastically.

121
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.071 line:80%
You're all so great.

122
00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:14.823 line:80%
Now,

123
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:18.160 line:80%
which female employee
will get to sleep in the camper?

124
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.953 line:80%
Number one, come out!

MARRY MY HUSBAND

126
00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:37.721 line:80%
Who is it?

127
00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:41.808 line:80%
What? Really?

128
00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:44.895 line:80%
It's me!

129
00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:52.027 line:80%
Please come forward.

130
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.287 line:80%
I'll give you the key to your camper!

131
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.122 line:80%
Congratulations!

132
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.667 line:80%
Find someone who's glamping.

133
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.252 line:80%
Thanks for this!

134
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:23.725 line:80%
Isn't sleeping in a camper
better than glamping?

135
00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:30.732 line:80%
The camper is right in front of me,

136
00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:32.359 line:80%
so why would I consider glamping?

137
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:51.128 line:80%
Congratulations, Ms. Kang Ji-won
from Marketing Team 1!

138
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.588 line:80%
Let's give her a round of applause!

139
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.257 line:80%
Congratulations!

140
00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:03.682 line:80%
Next, let's see which male employee
won the camper.

141
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:06.810 line:80%
Who found the number one flag?

142
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.770 line:80%
Please come to the front!

143
00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:09.896 line:80%
Come on up!

144
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:20.949 line:80%
Happy you beat me?

145
00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:27.622 line:80%
You know I can't just sleep anywhere.

146
00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.420 line:80%
Same goes for me.

147
00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:34.963 line:80%
Really?

148
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.967 line:80%
Then why did I think
you could sleep just about anywhere?

149
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.471 line:80%
Because I did so for you.

150
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:44.764 line:80%
What?

151
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.142 line:80%
Nothing, I'm going.

152
00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.527 line:80%
Why are you like this to me?

153
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.571 line:80%
What do you mean?

154
00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.114 line:80%
You won't let me win.

155
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.328 line:80%
How much longer will you keep this up?

156
00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:10.499 line:80%
I feel like I've become a bad person now.

157
00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:12.417 line:80%
You're too harsh to me lately.

158
00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:26.306 line:80%
I don't...

159
00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.435 line:80%
like you anymore.

160
00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:37.817 line:80%
I tried not to show it, but I failed.
I'll just tell you.

161
00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.570 line:80%
I just started to hate you.

162
00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.823 line:80%
You whine and try to act cute.

163
00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:46.576 line:80%
You think my things are yours.
It's annoying.

164
00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.164 line:80%
You yielded them to me!

165
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.335 line:80%
Is it bad I took that for granted?

166
00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.880 line:80%
You made me this way.
What am I supposed to do now?

167
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.303 line:80%
You're right. I always yielded

168
00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.180 line:80%
and let you whine.

169
00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:10.433 line:80%
So I'm going to stop now.

170
00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:15.981 line:80%
I'm marrying Min-hwan.

171
00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:18.984 line:80%
I'll start a new family.

172
00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.611 line:80%
I can't be tied to you forever.

173
00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:32.289 line:80%
Thanks for bringing it up first. Bye.

174
00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:50.140 line:80%
I feel like a bad person.

175
00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.977 line:80%
She's the one that was wrong.

176
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.355 line:80%
She's the bad one.
I only said what I should say, but...

177
00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:58.773 line:80%
You're just too good.

178
00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:05.530 line:80%
You're not bad enough to hurt others.

179
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.248 line:80%
But I know better than anyone.

180
00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:21.921 line:80%
You did what you had to.

181
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.136 line:80%
Good job.

182
00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.820 line:80%
Su-min must want to punish me.

183
00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.575 line:80%
If she thinks I'm being like this
because of Min-hwan,

184
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.788 line:80%
it's obvious how she'll try to punish me.

185
00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:58.333 line:80%
-I can't drink anymore.
-What? You have to finish your shot.

186
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.418 line:80%
-Gosh, I...
-Drink it.

187
00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:39.624 line:80%
What are you doing here?

188
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.880 line:80%
Shall we talk?

189
00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.103 line:80%
How did you know that I wanted...

190
00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:02.897 line:80%
to talk to you?

191
00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.529 line:80%
I can tell by your face.

192
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.115 line:80%
Did you drink a lot?

193
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.076 line:80%
Do you have a lot on your mind?

194
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.916 line:80%
Just a little.

195
00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:25.670 line:80%
I feel uneasy.

196
00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:37.724 line:80%
Just a little.

197
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.402 line:80%
Do you want...

198
00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.074 line:80%
to sleep with me?

199
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.121 line:80%
Will it change anything?

200
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.250 line:80%
You're Ji-won's boyfriend,
and I'm her other half.

201
00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.548 line:80%
Is it the alcohol?

202
00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.719 line:80%
I only care about who's in front of me.

203
00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:35.782 line:80%
Me too.

204
00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:39.786 line:80%
I drank a lot.

205
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.397 line:80%
I only need you too.

206
00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.445 line:80%
Maybe I'll push her off somewhere.

207
00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.498 line:80%
You can't check your wounds

208
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.878 line:80%
or your opponent's on the mat.

209
00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.089 line:80%
Focus only on two things.

210
00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.844 line:80%
"I decided to fight."

211
00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:23.473 line:80%
"And I will win."

212
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.733 line:80%
I decided to fight.

213
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.736 line:80%
And I will win...

214
00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.862 line:80%
The entire company is excited

215
00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:22.740 line:80%
about our marketing team lately!

216
00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:25.785 line:80%
Of course,
since the project's going so well.

217
00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:28.746 line:80%
We could go down
in U&K history at this rate!

218
00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.833 line:80%
I'm sorry, Hui-yeon.

219
00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.168 line:80%
Why would you be sorry?

220
00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.462 line:80%
The original sin is with Mr. Kim.

221
00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.131 line:80%
And the boomer is Mr. Yu.

222
00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:41.634 line:80%
No wonder this is so fun!

223
00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:43.219 line:80%
Mr. Kim isn't here!

224
00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:52.895 line:80%
I hear aroused elks always appear
during workshops.

225
00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.605 line:80%
I finally get to see it!

226
00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.024 line:80%
Are you insane?

227
00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:57.608 line:80%
-What? I want to...
-Let's go.

228
00:21:57.692 --> 00:21:59.110 line:80%
Seriously! Just once!

229
00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:01.112 line:80%
No, let's go.

230
00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:10.455 line:80%
I think I found Su-min so pretty.

231
00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.253 line:80%
When I first met her at 15,

232
00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:23.384 line:80%
I couldn't believe
someone so pretty and nice was my friend.

233
00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.014 line:80%
I was so proud. It was nice.

234
00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:31.476 line:80%
So I wanted to protect her.

235
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.647 line:80%
And Min-hwan...

236
00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:42.028 line:80%
He was such a jerk.

237
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.116 line:80%
But I needed someone to trust and lean on.

238
00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:51.412 line:80%
And after we got married,

239
00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:55.166 line:80%
I put up with him even more.

240
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:00.588 line:80%
Aren't I such a fool?

241
00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:04.884 line:80%
It's all over now.

242
00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:08.846 line:80%
Stop thinking about them.

243
00:23:09.764 --> 00:23:11.432 line:80%
Think about one thing today.

244
00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:13.601 line:80%
Kang Ji-won won.

245
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:25.571 line:80%
I haven't...

246
00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:30.326 line:80%
had someone touch my hand
this affectionately

247
00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:32.328 line:80%
in a long time.

248
00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:45.758 line:80%
Since I came back to 2013,

249
00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:50.596 line:80%
I've felt so lonely since I was alone.

250
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:59.147 line:80%
So I'm glad I have you.

251
00:24:01.232 --> 00:24:02.650 line:80%
Thank you.

252
00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:11.033 line:80%
To be honest,

253
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:16.414 line:80%
my life is like a well-written novel.

254
00:24:20.084 --> 00:24:23.129 line:80%
A life without any worries or obstacles.

255
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:24.338 line:80%
Just well-written.

256
00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:32.430 line:80%
So I'm glad I came back,

257
00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:36.058 line:80%
and I'm happy
I get to talk to you like this.

258
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:46.944 line:80%
I should thank you.

259
00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:01.792 line:80%
You never keep it simple.

260
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:04.212 line:80%
Is that so?

261
00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:11.010 line:80%
What did you say earlier?
What do you want to be?

262
00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:14.513 line:80%
I'll help you for helping me too.

263
00:25:15.973 --> 00:25:19.101 line:80%
I told you,
I don't want anything from you in return.

264
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:22.021 line:80%
I'm being honest, but you're not.

265
00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:24.982 line:80%
Then I won't let you help me.

266
00:25:25.942 --> 00:25:27.568 line:80%
Let's say I said champ.

267
00:25:28.236 --> 00:25:29.779 line:80%
No, you didn't.

268
00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:31.197 line:80%
Are you lying?

269
00:25:32.615 --> 00:25:33.783 line:80%
It's true.

270
00:25:45.753 --> 00:25:46.629 line:80%
Ji-won.

271
00:25:48.297 --> 00:25:52.426 line:80%
Did you sleep well when your boyfriend was
sleeping in a sleeping bag?

272
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.845 line:80%
You're so cold-hearted.

273
00:25:55.805 --> 00:25:57.598 line:80%
Did you really sleep there?

274
00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:00.017 line:80%
Where else, then?

275
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:02.436 line:80%
My selfish girlfriend slept in the camper.

276
00:26:03.187 --> 00:26:08.234 line:80%
Weren't you even worried your boyfriend
might be too cold overnight?

277
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:12.697 line:80%
I was, so I went to you with hand warmers,
but you weren't there.

278
00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:18.744 line:80%
I guess I was in the bathroom then.

279
00:26:18.828 --> 00:26:19.996 line:80%
Yes.

280
00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:22.206 line:80%
You could've just left them there.

281
00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.083 line:80%
Where's your common sense?

282
00:26:25.001 --> 00:26:25.960 line:80%
Where's Su-min?

283
00:26:29.547 --> 00:26:31.882 line:80%
How should I know where your friend is?

284
00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:35.386 line:80%
Where did she sleep?

285
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:38.347 line:80%
I don't know.

286
00:26:39.974 --> 00:26:43.853 line:80%
Something happened between us yesterday,
and it's uncomfortable.

287
00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:46.772 line:80%
Uncomfortable?

288
00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:49.817 line:80%
Did you fight?

289
00:26:50.568 --> 00:26:54.113 line:80%
Women are always fighting
and making up. Goodness.

290
00:26:59.744 --> 00:27:00.786 line:80%
What?

291
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.080 line:80%
Let's go eat breakfast.

292
00:27:19.597 --> 00:27:20.806 line:80%
Su-min.

293
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.185 line:80%
This isn't your tent.

294
00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:25.978 line:80%
Where were you last night?

295
00:27:26.562 --> 00:27:30.149 line:80%
I was drunk, so I slept over there.
I just left my stuff here.

296
00:27:31.734 --> 00:27:33.486 line:80%
Did you drink a lot too?

297
00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:38.991 line:80%
I was able to sober up a bit
after a walk with Hui-yeon last night.

298
00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:40.701 line:80%
I see.

299
00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:50.544 line:80%
Let's not tell Ji-won.

300
00:27:51.921 --> 00:27:52.755 line:80%
What?

301
00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:57.301 line:80%
It's not like she'll break up with me.
She'll only get hurt.

302
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:02.014 line:80%
You're close friends. It's unnecessary.

303
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:08.145 line:80%
Let's just be realistic.

304
00:28:08.813 --> 00:28:12.775 line:80%
As you said,
things are too complicated between us.

305
00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:18.906 line:80%
Instead of rolling around
in a messy reality,

306
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.659 line:80%
let's keep it as a beautiful memory.

307
00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:23.702 line:80%
Is it too greedy of me?

308
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.500 line:80%
Let's go eat.

309
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:30.960 line:80%
I'm so hungover.

310
00:28:31.794 --> 00:28:32.711 line:80%
Okay.

311
00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:41.053 line:80%
Why can I never get the best?

312
00:28:41.137 --> 00:28:41.971 line:80%
What?

313
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:46.642 line:80%
The workshop sucked.

314
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:49.770 line:80%
I wanted to sleep in a camper
or a glamping tent.

315
00:28:52.148 --> 00:28:53.899 line:80%
You'll have other chances.

316
00:28:53.983 --> 00:28:56.068 line:80%
Failure is the mother of success.

317
00:28:58.195 --> 00:29:02.074 line:80%
You're right. Nothing's impossible.

318
00:29:02.158 --> 00:29:04.076 line:80%
This is so nice!

319
00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:11.542 line:80%
Babe!

320
00:29:12.668 --> 00:29:13.502 line:80%
Here.

321
00:29:15.713 --> 00:29:17.298 line:80%
I'm so hungry.

322
00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:19.758 line:80%
Let's see the food over here first.

323
00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:22.219 line:80%
Babe, here. You like this.

324
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.145 line:80%
Wow! It's been so long
since I had an orange!

325
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.315 line:80%
Here's a melon!

326
00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:37.860 line:80%
Avocado! Wow!

327
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:41.489 line:80%
Let's see.

328
00:29:41.572 --> 00:29:43.115 line:80%
Can this help digestion?

329
00:30:16.774 --> 00:30:19.026 line:80%
I don't think it went as expected.

330
00:30:19.109 --> 00:30:22.780 line:80%
I've been with Su-min for 26 years,
and 17 years with Min-hwan.

331
00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:24.990 line:80%
I'm sure something happened.

332
00:30:25.074 --> 00:30:26.033 line:80%
Then...

333
00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:32.039 line:80%
When I felt something was off, all my
ex-boyfriends broke up with me right away.

334
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:36.126 line:80%
Min-hwan was the first to do it
behind my back.

335
00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:40.339 line:80%
I thought it was because of marriage.

336
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:47.054 line:80%
But if Min-hwan is
more of a scumbag than I thought...

337
00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:52.685 line:80%
It means

338
00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:55.354 line:80%
it's not over yet.

339
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.537 line:80%
Why are you so full of energy?

340
00:31:53.621 --> 00:31:57.041 line:80%
I hit a homerun!

341
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.002 line:80%
What? With your girlfriend's friend?

342
00:32:03.172 --> 00:32:04.381 line:80%
Shut up!

343
00:32:04.465 --> 00:32:06.550 line:80%
Wow! Seriously?

344
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.845 line:80%
But she's her best friend.

345
00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:11.764 line:80%
I'll tell you in one sentence.

346
00:32:13.349 --> 00:32:14.725 line:80%
Autumn was coming,

347
00:32:15.893 --> 00:32:17.770 line:80%
and the night air was sexy!

348
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:30.074 line:80%
What the... Okay, let's try again.

349
00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:35.204 line:80%
Can you handle the consequences?
You work in the same office.

350
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.838 line:80%

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.639 line:80%
You're going to Jomart.

355
00:32:53.722 --> 00:32:54.932 line:80%
It'll be tiring.

356
00:32:57.226 --> 00:32:59.019 line:80%
Why me?

357
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.480 line:80%
Shouldn't you go instead?

358
00:33:01.563 --> 00:33:03.440 line:80%
Right, you guys fought.

359
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:08.362 line:80%
Don't talk nonsense.
I have a presentation today.

360
00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:11.532 line:80%
A presentation?
The slides must be all ready, right?

361
00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:12.700 line:80%
I'll do it.

362
00:33:13.242 --> 00:33:14.702 line:80%
Is there a problem?

363
00:33:17.454 --> 00:33:19.707 line:80%
No, not at all, sir.

364
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:28.674 line:80%
Mr. Park, shall we go?

365
00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:30.300 line:80%
Yes.

366
00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:42.271 line:80%
I'll get going, Ms. Kang.

367
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:55.325 line:80%
Su-min's so smart.

368
00:33:56.577 --> 00:34:00.414 line:80%
She's working so hard.
I hope she becomes a full-time employee.

369
00:34:08.547 --> 00:34:10.924 line:80%
To my other half, Ji-won.

370
00:34:11.008 --> 00:34:13.469 line:80%
I'm sorry I didn't know how you felt.

371
00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:15.512 line:80%
You're everything to me,

372
00:34:15.596 --> 00:34:18.348 line:80%
and I think it made me
blind to your feelings.

373
00:34:18.432 --> 00:34:22.436 line:80%
I just blindly believed you loved me.

374
00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:25.689 line:80%
I didn't think
about whether I deserved your love.

375
00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:31.111 line:80%
So everything you said
and everything you feel towards me...

376
00:34:31.195 --> 00:34:32.696 line:80%
It's all my fault.

377
00:34:33.906 --> 00:34:39.578 line:80%
Still, can't you forgive me?

378
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:43.832 line:80%
You're too precious to me.
I can't live without you.

379
00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:47.753 line:80%
I'm going to wait until you feel better.

380
00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:52.633 line:80%
If I knock and you ever want to reopen
your closed heart to me,

381
00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:55.344 line:80%
will you smile as if nothing happened?

382
00:34:56.553 --> 00:34:58.096 line:80%
You're my other half.

383
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:01.433 line:80%
We can't just end things like this.

384
00:35:10.692 --> 00:35:13.070 line:80%
If I hadn't seen the end,

385
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.115 line:80%
would I have been able

386
00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:20.369 line:80%
to not be swayed after reading this?

387
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.550 line:80%
She's a good writer.

388
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:42.432 line:80%
Maybe she really means it.

389
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:01.785 line:80%
-You're doing well. Hurry up.
-Yes, Chef.

390
00:36:31.064 --> 00:36:32.858 line:80%
I don't want to see you face.

391
00:36:33.775 --> 00:36:34.776 line:80%
I'm jealous.

392
00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:45.037 line:80%
My life is like a well-written novel.

393
00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:52.419 line:80%
But if Kang Ji-won is
the one wrong sentence in it...

394
00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:55.797 line:80%
How would you feel?

395
00:36:58.133 --> 00:36:59.843 line:80%
Don't talk nonsense. Get up.

396
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:04.348 line:80%
It's short and crooked.

397
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:08.185 line:80%
The content and writing is a mess too.

398
00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:11.939 line:80%
So it keeps catching my eye
and bothering me.

399
00:37:13.857 --> 00:37:15.859 line:80%
It opens to her page when thrown.

400
00:37:18.528 --> 00:37:22.407 line:80%
There's nothing special
to find or remember in my life.

401
00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:25.869 line:80%
But only that part is so clear.

402
00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:32.709 line:80%
Nevertheless...

403
00:37:36.505 --> 00:37:38.882 line:80%
You're more qualified.

404
00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:44.972 line:80%
Because you'll be alive after ten years.

It's so good. I think it'll be a hit.

-Okay?
-Okay!

416

Also...

417
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.123 line:80%
I'll get the allergy sign.

Those who shop after work

and housewives.

420
00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:50.180 line:80%
We have to check preference too. So...

421
00:39:50.263 --> 00:39:51.389 line:80%
I need to go pee.

422

Mr. Park!

Why haven't you started?

What are you doing?

Can you check this?

Yeah, sure.

427
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.841 line:80%
What the...

428
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.301 line:80%
What is this?

429

What do you think?

You just had no other choice

I'm sure that's why you suggested it.
Still, I was very thankful...

I just wanted to thank you...

That's not why.

00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:48.965 line:80%
I thought you would be capable
of doing it.

448
00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:50.842 line:80%
Pardon?

449
00:41:51.468 --> 00:41:53.011 line:80%
And finish your sentences.

450
00:41:53.803 --> 00:41:57.682 line:80%
Don't trail off whenever you speak.

451
00:41:57.766 --> 00:42:01.102 line:80%
Just say, "Thank you."

452
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:04.481 line:80%
Yes, sir.

feedback, remember the good one too.

454

Pardon?

455
00:42:12.197 --> 00:42:15.784 line:80%
I said you would be capable of doing it.

456
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.536 line:80%
Right.

457
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.996 line:80%

Let it go. Nothing happened.

490
00:44:37.258 --> 00:44:40.887 line:80%
Things like this can happen
while you work.

491
00:44:41.513 --> 00:44:42.389 line:80%
Yes, sir.

492
00:44:42.472 --> 00:44:44.599 line:80%
Since it's just us, we'll let it go.

493
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:46.351 line:80%
If my daughter were here...

494
00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:48.353 line:80%
We apologize one more time.

495
00:44:55.402 --> 00:44:56.820 line:80%
Toss the receipt.

496
00:45:06.663 --> 00:45:08.998 line:80%
The ambulance fees and hospital bills.

497
00:45:09.082 --> 00:45:10.834 line:80%
But compensation too?

498
00:45:12.544 --> 00:45:17.173 line:80%
If he had such a dangerous allergy,
shouldn't he have been more careful?

499
00:45:17.257 --> 00:45:18.842 line:80%
Everyone likes money.

500
00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:21.428 line:80%
If the company finds out about this,

501
00:45:21.511 --> 00:45:23.430 line:80%
it'll be bad for us.

502
00:45:24.806 --> 00:45:27.809 line:80%
Paying them off is the easiest.

503
00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:32.480 line:80%
Still, you spent
so much of your own money.

504
00:45:32.564 --> 00:45:35.733 line:80%
It's okay. It's me!

505
00:45:35.817 --> 00:45:38.069 line:80%
I've gotten a good return on stocks.

506
00:45:38.153 --> 00:45:39.612 line:80%
-The CEO of TKU,
-So... What?

507
00:45:39.696 --> 00:45:43.450 line:80%
Oh Chang-gyu, fled overseas,
and it's been revealed only now.

508
00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:45.702 line:80%
A political emergency is happening.

509
00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:49.330 line:80%
Oh was once investigated
for his relationship with politician Choi.

510
00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:52.292 line:80%
He claimed he was innocent,
expressing his...

511
00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:54.210 line:80%
According to TMB's coverage,

512
00:45:54.294 --> 00:45:57.088 line:80%
it's been 27 days
since he fled the country.

513
00:45:57.172 --> 00:45:59.799 line:80%
It has been revealed that TKU employees

514
00:45:59.883 --> 00:46:02.594 line:80%
haven't been paid wages for two months.

515
00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:07.724 line:80%
What do I do? Seriously? Damn it!

516
00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:11.019 line:80%
How about selling everything now?

517
00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:12.187 line:80%
Who will buy it?

518
00:46:15.482 --> 00:46:17.734 line:80%
I already put it up for sale.

519
00:46:17.817 --> 00:46:19.986 line:80%
But everyone's trying to sell now.

520
00:46:21.446 --> 00:46:23.156 line:80%
Then what do you have to do?

521
00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:27.035 line:80%
The transaction will be...

522
00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:29.162 line:80%
Why are you asking? So annoying!

523
00:46:30.622 --> 00:46:33.791 line:80%
Then you can't get a cent?

524
00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:41.799 line:80%
Ji-won.

525
00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:46.429 line:80%
The situation is much more serious
than you think.

526
00:46:47.013 --> 00:46:48.097 line:80%
I used credit.

527
00:46:50.266 --> 00:46:52.352 line:80%
Credit? What do you mean?

528
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:54.354 line:80%
Then what do you have to do?

529
00:46:57.232 --> 00:47:00.360 line:80%
What's the point of talking to you?

530
00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:06.449 line:80%
Yes, Ms. Yang.

531
00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:10.578 line:80%
Yes, I'm in the bathroom.

532
00:47:12.664 --> 00:47:15.083 line:80%
You dummy. The credit isn't important.

533
00:47:16.793 --> 00:47:19.128 line:80%
I even took out a private loan.

534
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:22.048 line:80%
He didn't mention the private loan.

535
00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:23.508 line:80%
He didn't before too.

536
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:27.512 line:80%
He never says things to hurt his pride.
He's not the type.

537
00:47:29.514 --> 00:47:31.724 line:80%
Just in case, keep an eye on him.

538
00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:35.979 line:80%
I loved you.

539
00:47:40.024 --> 00:47:41.192 line:80%
What are you doing?

540
00:47:43.403 --> 00:47:45.071 line:80%
Was it our fate

541
00:47:45.738 --> 00:47:48.074 line:80%
to be a threesome, not just two of us?

542
00:47:49.701 --> 00:47:52.620 line:80%
Are you possessed? I don't understand you.

543
00:47:57.584 --> 00:48:00.128 line:80%
I'm going to marry Ji-won.

544
00:48:01.337 --> 00:48:02.922 line:80%
If we had more time,

545
00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:06.092 line:80%
I would've fallen for you completely.

546
00:48:06.175 --> 00:48:08.261 line:80%
But this fate puts the brake down.

547
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.222 line:80%
Then...

548
00:48:13.433 --> 00:48:14.851 line:80%
Goodbye.

549
00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:19.939 line:80%
So keep my mouth shut?

550
00:48:22.525 --> 00:48:23.568 line:80%
What?

551
00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:29.073 line:80%
I won't...

552
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:36.414 line:80%
say anything, Min-hwan. Don't worry.

553
00:48:37.957 --> 00:48:41.169 line:80%
I just want you to be happy.

554
00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:44.380 line:80%
What?

555
00:48:45.757 --> 00:48:46.633 line:80%
Happy?

556
00:49:02.899 --> 00:49:05.026 line:80%
Why does life suck so bad?

557
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:06.319 line:80%
Drink slowly.

558
00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:10.323 line:80%
Hey.

559
00:49:12.992 --> 00:49:14.285 line:80%
Do you like me?

560
00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:20.625 line:80%
Of course, I do.

561
00:49:23.044 --> 00:49:26.756 line:80%
Thank you for liking someone like me.

562
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.307 line:80%
You said to drink slowly, so I should.

563
00:49:38.726 --> 00:49:39.977 line:80%
I'm sorry.

564
00:49:41.646 --> 00:49:44.190 line:80%
I wanted to marry you next year,

565
00:49:45.775 --> 00:49:46.984 line:80%
but what's left...

566
00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:50.655 line:80%
is the Han River for me.

567
00:49:51.447 --> 00:49:54.283 line:80%
He's asking for money
in such a literary way.

568
00:50:00.248 --> 00:50:01.249 line:80%
Damn it!

569
00:50:01.874 --> 00:50:05.378 line:80%
You're young. You can earn it again.
I'm in no rush.

570
00:50:08.715 --> 00:50:10.800 line:80%
You can't say that.

571
00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:14.887 line:80%
Think of your age. What about kids?

572
00:50:14.971 --> 00:50:16.639 line:80%
You don't want any kids.

573
00:50:16.723 --> 00:50:19.016 line:80%
You're more important to me.

574
00:50:19.934 --> 00:50:21.352 line:80%
That's true.

575
00:50:22.437 --> 00:50:24.605 line:80%
I'm a third-generation only son.

576
00:50:24.689 --> 00:50:26.691 line:80%
How can I only think of myself?

577
00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:28.526 line:80%
That's true.

578
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.362 line:80%
Then what should we do?

579
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:40.246 line:80%
Ji-won?

580
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:44.125 line:80%
Shall we get married?

581
00:50:47.378 --> 00:50:50.089 line:80%
I can't give you a glamorous life
as I planned.

582
00:50:51.466 --> 00:50:56.596 line:80%
But we'll be
a better family tomorrow than we are now.

583
00:50:57.722 --> 00:50:59.182 line:80%
I promise.

584
00:51:05.354 --> 00:51:06.355 line:80%
Family?

585
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:08.149 line:80%
Family.

586
00:51:08.733 --> 00:51:12.695 line:80%
I know you get weak when I mention family.

587
00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:18.326 line:80%
What a crappy way to say you'll sponge off
me for life. You call that family?

588
00:51:20.578 --> 00:51:23.706 line:80%
It took courage for me to say that.
What's with you?

589
00:51:25.208 --> 00:51:27.418 line:80%
Is it because I'm broke now?

590
00:51:28.419 --> 00:51:30.630 line:80%
You're not that type of snob.

591
00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:38.971 line:80%
How funny, right?

592
00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:42.016 line:80%
He wants to marry without a penny.

593
00:51:42.517 --> 00:51:46.437 line:80%
No, he must want to marry me
now that he's broke.

594
00:51:48.731 --> 00:51:50.525 line:80%
This is the same as before.

595
00:51:51.526 --> 00:51:55.321 line:80%
He proposed to me, saying
he'd invest with his parents' money.

596
00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:03.120 line:80%
My debt started to get bigger
when that went south.

597
00:52:03.204 --> 00:52:07.333 line:80%
But he was the person I chose,
so I thought we'd work it out together.

598
00:52:08.084 --> 00:52:10.211 line:80%
He was selfish.

599
00:52:11.963 --> 00:52:15.007 line:80%
Anyway, all my choices were backwards.

600
00:52:31.691 --> 00:52:33.609 line:80%
You'll get fat if you eat like that.

601
00:52:40.241 --> 00:52:45.538 line:80%
I used to give a stray cat food
in college.

602
00:52:48.249 --> 00:52:50.209 line:80%
I wanted to bring him home,

603
00:52:51.085 --> 00:52:54.005 line:80%
but I was scared
I couldn't raise him properly.

604
00:52:54.922 --> 00:52:55.923 line:80%
Then...

605
00:52:57.466 --> 00:53:00.344 line:80%
the cat disappeared one day.

606
00:53:00.428 --> 00:53:01.971 line:80%
It was a cold winter.

607
00:53:02.763 --> 00:53:05.391 line:80%
I regretted it so much then.

608
00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:11.731 line:80%
He was so tiny. Like this big.

609
00:53:12.607 --> 00:53:14.483 line:80%
He had such a temper.

610
00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:19.780 line:80%
He got chased away
after trying to fight other cats.

611
00:53:21.157 --> 00:53:24.201 line:80%
He hated people,
so I don't think anyone took him.

612
00:53:37.089 --> 00:53:38.549 line:80%
To tell the truth,

613
00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:41.010 line:80%
I was discharged early.

614
00:53:42.136 --> 00:53:44.472 line:80%
It was similar to a car accident.

615
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:48.476 line:80%
Similar to a car accident?

616
00:54:10.873 --> 00:54:12.792 line:80%
Are you okay?

617
00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:13.918 line:80%
Yeah, I'm fine.

618
00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:24.136 line:80%
Are you okay?

619
00:54:33.354 --> 00:54:34.855 line:80%
I ruptured my knee ligaments.

620
00:54:39.819 --> 00:54:42.863 line:80%
I jumped in front of a car to save a cat.

621
00:54:42.947 --> 00:54:44.532 line:80%
I didn't get hit, though.

622
00:54:50.121 --> 00:54:51.288 line:80%
Then...

623
00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:56.794 line:80%
the cat you're raising now...

624
00:54:57.795 --> 00:54:59.797 line:80%
It was the winter of 2005.

625
00:55:01.882 --> 00:55:04.635 line:80%
A cheese tabby with a bad temper.

626
00:55:07.763 --> 00:55:09.098 line:80%
Doesn't like people.

627
00:55:23.696 --> 00:55:25.573 line:80%
Are you going to work out?

628
00:55:26.615 --> 00:55:27.783 line:80%
Hello?

629
00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:29.410 line:80%
Where'd they go?

630
00:55:30.703 --> 00:55:33.873 line:80%
Was it you? It was you all along!

631
00:55:34.957 --> 00:55:37.960 line:80%
I thought you looked similar.
It was really you!

632
00:55:39.587 --> 00:55:41.172 line:80%
It's 20130419.

633
00:55:41.756 --> 00:55:42.798 line:80%
My passcode.

634
00:55:42.882 --> 00:55:44.091 line:80%
Come anytime.

635
00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:46.177 line:80%
Really? Can I?

636
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.889 line:80%
Let's see each other more often!

637
00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:52.975 line:80%
You're so cute!

638
00:56:01.776 --> 00:56:04.612 line:80%
Either way, Mr. Park must get married now.

639
00:56:06.197 --> 00:56:09.033 line:80%
Yes. Since he needs
to get money from his family.

640
00:56:11.327 --> 00:56:15.873 line:80%
His debts are probably
about half a billion won in total.

641
00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:18.084 line:80%
Maybe more.

642
00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:21.337 line:80%
It was worthwhile lending him

643
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.381 line:80%
my money to make him go all in with TKU.

644
00:56:24.924 --> 00:56:28.969 line:80%
But at this rate, I don't think
he'll give up marrying you.

645
00:56:31.263 --> 00:56:33.224 line:80%
So I came up with this plan.

646
00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:36.477 line:80%
Although,

647
00:56:38.562 --> 00:56:40.773 line:80%
I'll have to get his crappy proposal.

648
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:46.779 line:80%
It must be so annoying for me, right?

649
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:50.407 line:80%
But if I want to live a long life,
I must work hard.

650
00:56:53.285 --> 00:56:55.204 line:80%
He proposed on my birthday.

651
00:56:55.913 --> 00:57:00.084 line:80%
Everything he did was tolerable back then.

652
00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:01.752 line:80%
But I hated it.

653
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:04.296 line:80%
One, two, three.

654
00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:42.710 line:80%
I have to see that again?

655
00:57:45.337 --> 00:57:46.422 line:80%
Terrible, right?

656
00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:50.342 line:80%
It's my first birthday after being reborn.

657
00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:01.353 line:80%
Ji-hyuk did?

658
00:58:01.437 --> 00:58:03.022 line:80%
Yes, sir.

659
00:58:03.105 --> 00:58:04.607 line:80%
Oh, right. Also...

660
00:58:12.323 --> 00:58:13.365 line:80%
NECESSITY OF R&D

661
00:58:13.449 --> 00:58:15.451 line:80%
TEST FLIGHT RESULTS

662
00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:18.120 line:80%
Wait, so this technology is possible?

663
00:58:18.204 --> 00:58:21.999 line:80%
Apparently, the development team says
we can finally try it.

664
00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:26.128 line:80%
As you can see,
those are the test flight results.

665
00:58:28.088 --> 00:58:30.299 line:80%
U&K Aerobotics.

666
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:32.051 line:80%
Shall I secure more stocks?

667
00:58:32.134 --> 00:58:34.261 line:80%
If this is possible, of course.

668
00:58:34.345 --> 00:58:36.347 line:80%
That's that. About Ji-hyuk again.

669
00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:42.561 line:80%
What on earth is he thinking right now?

670
00:59:23.185 --> 00:59:24.186 line:80%
Ji-won?

671
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:31.777 line:80%
Min-hwan, what is all--

672
00:59:35.281 --> 00:59:36.532 line:80%
Don't say anything.

673
00:59:38.158 --> 00:59:40.035 line:80%
Tonight's for you.

674
00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:45.416 line:80%
My princess.

675
00:59:53.257 --> 00:59:54.258 line:80%
Kang Ji-won.

676
01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:03.934 line:80%
I love you.

677
01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:37.343 line:80%
Let me.

678
01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:54.109 line:80%
I'll do everything I can for you, Ji-won.

679
01:00:54.193 --> 01:00:56.570 line:80%
She won't know this is cubic, right?

680
01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.864 line:80%
But it's not like she'll toss it.

681
01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.951 line:80%
I won't let them marry.

682
01:01:04.203 --> 01:01:06.997 line:80%
You'd hate to see me happy.

683
01:01:16.632 --> 01:01:17.800 line:80%
Yes.

684
01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:21.220 line:80%
Please use whatever means necessary

685
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.682 line:80%
to marry my husband.

686
01:01:40.948 --> 01:01:44.118 line:80%
Ji-won jumped in the water for me.

687
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:45.285 line:80%
Ji-won.

688
01:01:46.078 --> 01:01:48.747 line:80%
It's your turn to make me happy.

689
01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:52.793 line:80%
It was the best first birthday.

690
01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:56.755 line:80%
I'm engaged!

691
01:01:57.339 --> 01:02:01.260 line:80%
I'm going to milk him
for the first and last time.

692
01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:02.803 line:80%
She bought all this?

693
01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.139 line:80%
My mother-in-law has high standards.

694
01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.015 line:80%
Why are you here?

695
01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:08.559 line:80%
Isn't the family meeting today?

696
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.894 line:80%
I'm happy with now.

697
01:02:11.437 --> 01:02:16.316 line:80%
It's obvious what kind of family
she'll marry into.
