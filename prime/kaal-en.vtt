Go ahead! Go ahead!

00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.000 line:82%
Stop. No, go close!

00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:03.000 line:82%
Oh, God!

4
00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:05.583 line:82%
Go back. Run! Run! Run!

5
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.125 line:82%
Oh, God!

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.750 line:82%
"Despite being wounded,

7
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:35.666 line:82%
the tiger managed to killthe foreigners.

8
00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:39.250 line:82%
We often call tigers "man-eaters"and put all the blame on them,

9
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:41.083 line:82%
but aren't they justifiedin protecting themselves?

10
00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.166 line:82%
By flouting the rulesof the preserve,

11
00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:46.750 line:82%
such tourists not only losetheir lives,

12
00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:48.250 line:82%
but reduce even more

13
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:51.666 line:82%
the already diminishing numberof tigers in our country.

14
00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.458 line:82%
Save the tiger,

15
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.250 line:82%
or the day when futuregenerations

16
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:59.166 line:82%
will only get to see the tigerin books won't be far away.

17
00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:00.958 line:82%
Orbit Park."

18
00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:30.125 line:82%
Krish!

19
00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:43.583 line:82%
London head office!

20
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.583 line:82%
Hello?

21
00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:50.708 line:82%
-Mr. Krish Thapar?
-Yeah!

22
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.125 line:82%
-You've been assigned a new project.
-Okay.

23
00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:54.666 line:82%
You'll be receiving the details soon.

24
00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:56.791 line:82%
-Kindly get back to us.
-Okay.

25
00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:58.250 line:82%
Thank you very much.

26
00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:02.833 line:82%
Our vacation is over.
There's something more exciting.

27
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.083 line:82%
Krish, there's a courier,

28
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.208 line:82%
from
National Geographic,
Washington.

29
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.416 line:82%
The head office has been
researching for over a year.

30
00:13:21.458 --> 00:13:25.708 line:82%
Their goal is to save
the tiger and its habitat.

31
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.583 line:82%
According to the
National Geographic
findings,

32
00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:33.000 line:82%
tiger poaching is at an all time high.

33
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.791 line:82%
The incident with the tiger experts
from the British office two months ago

34
00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.125 line:82%
remains unsolved.

35
00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:41.083 line:82%
But the report clearly states

36
00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:43.666 line:82%
that the foreigners foolishly
confronted the tiger.

37
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:51.250 line:82%
We always tend to believe
what they write and what we read.

38
00:13:51.291 --> 00:13:56.125 line:82%
Riya, the people who died were experienced
researchers, not amateurs.

39
00:13:56.166 --> 00:14:01.208 line:82%
After that incident, there have been
similar ones in two months.

40
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:06.125 line:82%
Two more specialists and several tourists
have died mysteriously.

41
00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:11.583 line:82%
Basheer Khan, main suspect
behind tiger poaching.

42
00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:15.083 line:82%
Three years posted at Ranthambore forest,
then at Kanha forest,

43
00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:16.708 line:82%
and now, Orbit Park.

44
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.000 line:82%
Ever since he has been appointed,
the tiger killings have increased.

45
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:25.125 line:82%
Once the forest preserve shuts down,
illegal activities become easier.

46
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.291 line:82%
What do you think?

47
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.458 line:82%
I don't know.

48
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.291 line:82%
But I'm sure these deaths
are not just tiger-related.

49
00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:39.166 line:82%
There could be more to it.

50
00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:43.375 line:82%
Whenever there's an incident
with a tourist or a researcher,

51
00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:46.625 line:82%
people use it to create terror.

52
00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:48.166 line:82%
What's the plan?

53
00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:50.875 line:82%
We must go to Orbit
and find the truth.

54
00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.500 line:82%
We can only be sure when we go there.

55
00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:59.083 line:82%
-We'll go to Orbit, then.
-We'll leave tomorrow morning.

56
00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:01.708 line:82%
But, Krish, the rain.

57
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.666 line:82%
The forest preserve will shut down
in two to three days.

58
00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:07.083 line:82%
I don't think it's advisable to go there
in this weather.

59
00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:09.000 line:82%
I'm sure two to three days
will be enough.

60
00:15:10.458 --> 00:15:13.291 line:82%
Besides, you are with me,
my ace photographer.

61
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.125 line:82%
Riya, if our research is successful,
we'll be solving a big mystery.

62
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.166 line:82%
The thrill of a first date
and the first drive is something else!

63
00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:11.041 line:82%
Hey, gorgeous!
I waited two years for this day.

64
00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:17.500 line:82%
I always knew
you were made just for me.

65
00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:25.500 line:82%
Cut the crap.

66
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.041 line:82%
Cut the crap!

67
00:16:49.916 --> 00:16:51.875 line:82%
Hey, guys.

68
00:16:51.916 --> 00:16:53.208 line:82%
Why aren't you talking?

69
00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.750 line:82%
How's my new cruiser truck?
You want more?

70
00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:22.916 line:82%
-Indian roads!
-Stop cribbing.

71
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.750 line:82%
-Ranjit Singh farm house.
-Rocking, man.

72
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.166 line:82%
These truck drivers!
I feel like killing them!

73
00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:35.000 line:82%
-Ishika, he's talking to you.
-Yeah, right!

74
00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:37.416 line:82%
-Recoil operated.
-Do I care?

75
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:40.000 line:82%
Single action, semi-automatic.

76
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:43.083 line:82%
That's nothing.
I have a double automatic.

77
00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:44.750 line:82%
It's a toy. A toy!

78
00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:51.958 line:82%
It's not funny. One pull of a trigger
and there lies the prey.

79
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.708 line:82%
-You won't improve, will you?
-One shot.

80
00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:56.625 line:82%
One kill.

81
00:17:56.666 --> 00:17:59.250 line:82%
I feel like killing you.

82
00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:00.958 line:82%
-Ishika.
-Have you got the car blessed?

83
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.708 line:82%
-Black car!
-It's a new car, isn't it?

84
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.583 line:82%
-Cut the crap!
-It's inauspicious!

85
00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:05.625 line:82%
Cut the crap.

86
00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:11.291 line:82%
Dev, please.
I beg you. Slow down!

87
00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:12.791 line:82%
I tell you,
it's very inauspicious.

88
00:18:12.833 --> 00:18:14.625 line:82%
Black nitron. GSR.

89
00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:17.583 line:82%
-As long as I'm around, you can't hunt.
-You guys are impossible.

90
00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:19.250 line:82%
I'll pull the trigger
and you will be the prey.

91
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:20.833 line:82%
-Watch out!
-You guys want to stop somewhere?

92
00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:22.375 line:82%
What are you doing, man?

93
00:18:22.416 --> 00:18:23.625 line:82%
-100 kilometers.
-Dev!

94
00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:25.041 line:82%
-Black Friday!
-He's mad!

95
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:26.708 line:82%
-How many times have I told you, Dev?
-God.

96
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.208 line:82%
-Everything is black.
-Barrel length.

97
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.958 line:82%
-Stop it!
-Look here for a minute.

98
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.250 line:82%
-Yes?
-Five inches.

99
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:33.166 line:82%
-It's inauspicious.
-Beefcake!

100
00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:36.291 line:82%
-What, me?
-Hey, Ishika.

101
00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:39.166 line:82%
-One shot, two kill.
-It's not funny.

102
00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:40.208 line:82%
Cut the crap!

103
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.500 line:82%
Dev, black cat, watch out!

104
00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:56.791 line:82%
Dev! Dev, I told you so many times!
Slow down, slow down!

105
00:18:56.833 --> 00:19:00.291 line:82%
You have killed a black cat.
Do you know what that means?

106
00:19:00.333 --> 00:19:02.458 line:82%
It's very inauspicious.
It's unlucky!

107
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.958 line:82%
-I swear. Very unlucky.
-Just shut up, Vishal. Just shut up!

108
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.166 line:82%
Jaan, just cool down. Relax!
Enough of your superstitions.

109
00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:14.416 line:82%
-Give me a break here!
-Dev, today is a Friday.

110
00:19:14.458 --> 00:19:17.500 line:82%
The cat was black, the car is black.
It's all black!

111
00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:18.541 line:82%
Hey, hey!

112
00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:20.791 line:82%
My hair's also black. My eyes are black,
and even my tongue!

113
00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:23.458 line:82%
What do you want me to do?
It's cool, just calm down!

114
00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:32.791 line:82%
Hey, guys, why are you fighting?
There's no dead cat.

115
00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:35.666 line:82%
-It escaped. Relax.
-Thank God!

116
00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.000 line:82%
All right? Happy?
Can we go now?

117
00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:03.041 line:82%
You know, guys, that's the difference
between our cars and the imported ones.

118
00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:04.833 line:82%
They are so sturdy, solid.

119
00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:08.291 line:82%
Even if you drive at 200 km/h,
they never wobble, you know?

120
00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:23.375 line:82%
Come on, guys! Of course
it's the Indian roads, man.

121
00:20:23.416 --> 00:20:27.875 line:82%
Any car will wobble, right?
But ours is different.

122
00:20:27.916 --> 00:20:31.583 line:82%
It doesn't heat up after some wobbling
or the engine starts making noises.

123
00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:43.125 line:82%
But at least you know there's
no smoke coming,

124
00:20:43.166 --> 00:20:44.625 line:82%
that never happens.

125
00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:50.708 line:82%
And bumps? That's the last thing
you can expect, right?

126
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.041 line:82%
You bet! I mean,
this car never chokes...

127
00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:06.916 line:82%
Dev, I told you something
was wrong, inauspicious.

128
00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:11.416 line:82%
C'mon, Ishk. What's inauspicious?
Your black cat is safe and sound.

129
00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:14.625 line:82%
What's inauspicious? Me?
I think I'm jinxed.

130
00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:17.333 line:82%
Damn!

131
00:21:26.875 --> 00:21:28.125 line:82%
Holy shit!

132
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:39.791 line:82%
Dev, what happened?

133
00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:42.000 line:82%
Nothing, nothing,
we're just unlucky.

134
00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:47.833 line:82%
Give it everything you got!

135
00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:49.791 line:82%
Very good, very good.

136
00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:52.083 line:82%
Push harder. Okay.

137
00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:53.625 line:82%
Are you guys pushing too
or it'll be just me?

138
00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:55.541 line:82%
I'm pushing too.

139
00:21:55.583 --> 00:21:58.083 line:82%
Vishal, are you going to push
or do you want me to push you?

140
00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:00.916 line:82%
Push harder!
What are you doing?

141
00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:06.250 line:82%
-Okay. I'm tired.
-Sajid, you push, I'll just come.

142
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.625 line:82%
Sajid, push well, man.
Okay, I'll help you.

143
00:22:10.666 --> 00:22:14.375 line:82%
Gopal Pure Vegetarian Dhaba!
Bad day!

144
00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:21.083 line:82%
The car's broken down.
Any mechanic around?

145
00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:23.625 line:82%
Yes, sir, there's paratha, there's
potatoes and cabbage curry.

146
00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:24.750 line:82%
What?

147
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:27.833 line:82%
There's also glucose biscuits
and, of course, the two of us.

148
00:22:27.875 --> 00:22:30.166 line:82%
And, sir, the business is quite slow.

149
00:22:30.208 --> 00:22:32.458 line:82%
No one uses this road these days.

150
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.625 line:82%
I don't know what made us
leave in a bad moment.

151
00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:39.125 line:82%
-The trip has begun on a wrong note.
-It's okay, darling.

152
00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:43.583 line:82%
It's not a big deal, just depressing,
my new car and... Anyway.

153
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:47.000 line:82%
This is nothing! You know my car,
the brand new one.

154
00:22:47.041 --> 00:22:50.750 line:82%
It broke down standing in the showroom.
This is nothing!

155
00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:55.333 line:82%
Anyway, you just take care of the car
while I get down to the food business.

156
00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:56.666 line:82%
It's hot!

157
00:22:57.875 --> 00:23:01.333 line:82%
Baby, you are hot! You eat something
while I make a call.

158
00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:05.625 line:82%
Hey, give me 15 to 20 parathas.
With butter.

159
00:23:05.666 --> 00:23:08.000 line:82%
And ask them what they want.

160
00:23:08.041 --> 00:23:09.291 line:82%
Come on!

161
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:15.250 line:82%
There's no signal.
The new car broke down.

162
00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:19.083 line:82%
Looks like something's
inauspicious!

163
00:23:26.041 --> 00:23:28.625 line:82%
-Poor Dev, he's upset.
-Totally ruined my mood.

164
00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:29.875 line:82%
-I'm very upset.
-Why are you upset?

165
00:23:29.916 --> 00:23:33.083 line:82%
-I'm really, truly upset.
-Come on, guys.

166
00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:35.041 line:82%
I've made arrangements
for us to leave. Come on, let's go.

167
00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:37.375 line:82%
-At least let us to eat.
-Come on, now!

168
00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:40.916 line:82%
Come on.

169
00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:42.708 line:82%
Come on, guys.

170
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.458 line:82%
-What did you say your name was?
-Bagga.

171
00:24:11.458 --> 00:24:13.041 line:82%
Hail Lord of Death.

172
00:24:32.875 --> 00:24:36.500 line:82%
Hey, you, bearded man.

173
00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:39.333 line:82%
Play some music, man.
You've got some hip-hop?

174
00:24:50.291 --> 00:24:53.583 line:82%
Why are you playing
these ghost songs?

175
00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:56.958 line:82%
Why don't you lower the volume?
Stop bugging us.

176
00:24:59.083 --> 00:25:01.791 line:82%
What was it that you
were chanting earlier?

177
00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:06.125 line:82%
-I have never heard that one.
-Mrityunjay chant, to ward off death.

178
00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:09.791 line:82%
People chant the Gayatri,
they think of Ganpati.

179
00:25:09.833 --> 00:25:12.083 line:82%
This Mrityunjay thing?

180
00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:25.833 line:82%
Oh, God!

181
00:25:25.875 --> 00:25:30.625 line:82%
Did you see that, ma'am?
An accident with the truck.

182
00:25:32.083 --> 00:25:34.583 line:82%
And it's just broken skulls
and fried brains.

183
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.333 line:82%
Only pieces left.
A dog's death.

184
00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:43.500 line:82%
That's why I chant "Hail Lord of Death."

185
00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:45.625 line:82%
At any rate,

186
00:25:45.666 --> 00:25:49.208 line:82%
in weather like this you have to leave
everything to your fate and judgment.

187
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.416 line:82%
What?

188
00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:55.833 line:82%
That's nothing, sir. If we stop,
we need to get our brakes in order.

189
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:04.833 line:82%
Sir, do you have a
ghoda
?

190
00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:08.083 line:82%
-What?
-A gun?

191
00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:12.625 line:82%
Yes. I own a farmhouse,
so sometimes small--

192
00:26:12.666 --> 00:26:15.125 line:82%
You hunt game?

193
00:26:15.166 --> 00:26:18.833 line:82%
So? What's the big deal?
Just drive quietly.

194
00:26:27.958 --> 00:26:30.375 line:82%
Why did you stop the car?

195
00:26:30.416 --> 00:26:32.375 line:82%
What are you going to kill?

196
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:36.541 line:82%
Boar, rabbit, or just a jungle cat?

197
00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:39.291 line:82%
Just mind your own bloody business.

198
00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:40.916 line:82%
Dev, just a minute.
What are you trying to say?

199
00:26:40.958 --> 00:26:43.250 line:82%
Do you want to make a big kill, sir?

200
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:45.875 line:82%
No one goes
on the Ranjitgadh road anymore.

201
00:26:45.916 --> 00:26:47.250 line:82%
And there's an electricity problem there.

202
00:26:47.291 --> 00:26:51.500 line:82%
Come with me. It's close by,
a huge jungle. Orbit.

203
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:55.083 line:82%
-I'll get you a big kill.
-Just cut the crap, man.

204
00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:56.625 line:82%
Just take the car on the road
to the farmhouse.

205
00:26:56.666 --> 00:26:59.500 line:82%
-And stop this crap about hunting.
-Dev, just wait.

206
00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:02.125 line:82%
This sounds damn interesting.
It will be an adventure.

207
00:27:02.166 --> 00:27:05.458 line:82%
We keep going to the farmhouse
all the time. Let's try something new!

208
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.083 line:82%
No, man! What's this Orbit nonsense?
Are you nuts?

209
00:27:08.125 --> 00:27:10.750 line:82%
Sajid, where will we stay?
There are no hotels, nothing.

210
00:27:10.791 --> 00:27:12.791 line:82%
-How will we manage?
-All that can be organized, madam.

211
00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:15.708 line:82%
-Leave the
jugaad
to me.
-
Jugaad
? Who's that?

212
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.791 line:82%
Just take a left from here.

213
00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:19.875 line:82%
Sajid, behave yourself!
Stop getting carried away.

214
00:27:19.916 --> 00:27:22.000 line:82%
His plan is crap! Stop the car!
Listen, just take the right.

215
00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:26.750 line:82%
Dev, we have come here for a holiday.
It will be a new place.

216
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:28.791 line:82%
-It sounds like fun!
-Sajid.

217
00:27:28.833 --> 00:27:31.875 line:82%
I know you want to go there
because you want to hunt.

218
00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:36.541 line:82%
And I will not allow that.
I hate it, you know that.

219
00:27:36.583 --> 00:27:38.791 line:82%
All right! You have a problem
with hunting.

220
00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:42.416 line:82%
So here. I won't even think
about going on a hunt, okay?

221
00:27:42.458 --> 00:27:45.291 line:82%
But, Dev, it sounds very exciting!
Let's go.

222
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:48.250 line:82%
It'll only be one or two nights.
Vishal! Ishika!

223
00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:51.083 line:82%
Come on, if he is saying he won't
do it, then he won't.

224
00:27:51.125 --> 00:27:53.708 line:82%
Vishal! Have you lost it?
He's a dumbass.

225
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.083 line:82%
-l am going to kill him one day.
-If he's insisting so much, it's okay.

226
00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:58.708 line:82%
-It might be fun.
-But, love.

227
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.541 line:82%
Besides, you are with me.
I don't care where we go.

228
00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:03.750 line:82%
-How far is it from here?
-Half an hour, ma'am.

229
00:28:03.791 --> 00:28:06.666 line:82%
Ishika, you are such a sweetheart!

230
00:28:08.125 --> 00:28:12.250 line:82%
If you weren't Dev's girlfriend,
I would have proposed a long time ago.

231
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.250 line:82%
It's a joke!

232
00:28:18.166 --> 00:28:19.250 line:82%
It better be.

233
00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:24.958 line:82%
So we're on, then!
It's going to be very cold, sir.

234
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.333 line:82%
It's going to be fun!
And there will be a lot of food too.

235
00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:29.708 line:82%
Hail Lord of Death.

236
00:28:56.791 --> 00:29:01.125 line:82%
This is where the forest preserve begins.Don't make a sound, sir.

237
00:29:01.166 --> 00:29:03.916 line:82%
1,300 square kilometers.An animal world.

238
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.541 line:82%
There are dense mountainsand deep ravines.

239
00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:17.458 line:82%
They say this preserve has India'slargest number of tigers.

240
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.916 line:82%
The fear of the tiger is kept alivethrough its paw prints.

241
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.291 line:82%
You can't see any sign of life around you,

242
00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:32.250 line:82%
but the animals are watching all the time.

243
00:29:33.875 --> 00:29:37.458 line:82%
What's alive todaycan become food tomorrow.

244
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.458 line:82%
There's no sound of vehiclesor cell phones here.

245
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:46.250 line:82%
This place has other sounds.

246
00:29:46.291 --> 00:29:49.333 line:82%
Do you hear those screams?
It's the monkeys.

247
00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:51.916 line:82%
They are the first ones to know
where the tiger is hunting.

248
00:29:55.041 --> 00:29:57.458 line:82%
Sir, walking on the ground here
is forbidden.

249
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.750 line:82%
No one dares to walk
where there are tiger paw prints.

250
00:30:04.333 --> 00:30:05.500 line:82%
Really?

251
00:30:07.208 --> 00:30:08.500 line:82%
This is nothing!

252
00:30:08.541 --> 00:30:11.041 line:82%
At our farmhouse I have
seen double marks! Double marks!

253
00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:12.416 line:82%
Shut up, Vishal.

254
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:16.291 line:82%
Tigers don't attack humans, do they?

255
00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:20.166 line:82%
Madam, if some strangers
got into your house,

256
00:30:20.208 --> 00:30:22.166 line:82%
wouldn't you try to throw them out?

257
00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:25.750 line:82%
This is their home, you are the stranger.

258
00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:28.125 line:82%
So if you make a mistake...

259
00:30:29.125 --> 00:30:31.375 line:82%
-What do you say, Sajid?
-Come on, now.

260
00:30:40.625 --> 00:30:42.333 line:82%
The jungle lives only by one rule.

261
00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:44.833 line:82%
As long as you are alive, you shine.

262
00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:46.875 line:82%
The day you become the prey, the light
of your existence is extinguished.

263
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.583 line:82%
ORBIT TIGER PRESERVE: PLEASE HELP
THE ANIMALS IN THE PRESERVE

264
00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:50.875 line:82%
KINDLY REFRAIN FROM HARASSING
OR BOTHERING THEM

265
00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:57.458 line:82%
What is there to talk, sir?
It's rained quite heavily.

266
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.458 line:82%
Just listen to me and go back.

267
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.333 line:82%
But we've made such a long trip.

268
00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:04.833 line:82%
Sir, please listen to me.
Go home.

269
00:31:04.875 --> 00:31:07.041 line:82%
-Or you will be in trouble.
-How can you say that?

270
00:31:07.083 --> 00:31:09.416 line:82%
At least give us an entry for a day.
We have come all the way from Delhi.

271
00:31:09.458 --> 00:31:14.000 line:82%
People come here from London and America,
they spend dollars and pounds.

272
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:18.333 line:82%
What's so special about you
coming from Delhi? Stop arguing.

273
00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:21.500 line:82%
Dev, just leave.
Let me handle this. Go on.

274
00:31:21.541 --> 00:31:24.208 line:82%
Bagga, just explain to them.

275
00:31:30.166 --> 00:31:34.000 line:82%
-Here. Take this. All done?
-That was so unnecessary, sir.

276
00:31:34.041 --> 00:31:36.500 line:82%
Before you enter the forest preserve,
please read the rules.

277
00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:38.958 line:82%
-They will be useful.
-Bagga, come on.

278
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.541 line:82%
Make it quick, Bagga.
Let's go!

279
00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:43.958 line:82%
-Come on, Sajid.
-Come on.

280
00:32:16.625 --> 00:32:18.791 line:82%
It's been such a long journey, Krish.

281
00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:21.125 line:82%
And now the car has broken down.
This is all we need.

282
00:32:24.166 --> 00:32:28.041 line:82%
It's so beautiful.
I think it's romantic.

283
00:32:29.291 --> 00:32:33.416 line:82%
Yeah, sure!
It all looks beautiful.

284
00:32:33.458 --> 00:32:36.625 line:82%
But only up to the tree line.

285
00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:41.666 line:82%
There's another world beyond that,
isn't it?

286
00:32:43.833 --> 00:32:45.458 line:82%
A world that's not ours.

287
00:32:47.375 --> 00:32:52.041 line:82%
Beautiful and just as dangerous.

288
00:32:52.083 --> 00:32:54.125 line:82%
Krish, look here.

289
00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:12.625 line:82%
How much longer?

290
00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:25.791 line:82%
Stop the car, stop the car!

291
00:33:25.833 --> 00:33:27.083 line:82%
Back up.

292
00:33:31.125 --> 00:33:33.833 line:82%
-What's this road?
-Sir, this is the core area.

293
00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:35.125 line:82%
There's no access.

294
00:33:35.166 --> 00:33:38.791 line:82%
-Only forest officials can go in.
-Why?

295
00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:42.083 line:82%
Just for census or other special work.
It's dangerous.

296
00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:46.375 line:82%
But the most poaching takes place
in the core area, right?

297
00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:50.583 line:82%
Hey! Are you okay?

298
00:33:56.375 --> 00:34:00.958 line:82%
There's a stream down there.
I'll get some water.

299
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.500 line:82%
Krish, there's a river.
Let's go.

300
00:34:04.541 --> 00:34:07.625 line:82%
-You wait here.
-We are coming too.

301
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:23.416 line:82%
You rear ended me!

302
00:35:23.458 --> 00:35:26.750 line:82%
You damn fool, you rear ended me!

303
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:30.791 line:82%
-Your car was in the middle of the road.
-And you're blind?

304
00:35:30.833 --> 00:35:33.250 line:82%
-It was in the middle!
-You son of a bitch!

305
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:35.291 line:82%
-It's not my fault.
-Of course it is!

306
00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:38.708 line:82%
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is. Why did you crash?

307
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:39.833 line:82%
Your car was in the way.

308
00:35:39.875 --> 00:35:42.333 line:82%
-It's my father's road!
-You'll say this jungle is your father's.

309
00:35:42.375 --> 00:35:44.000 line:82%
-Yes, it belongs to my father!
-So it's all yours?

310
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.958 line:82%
Okay! What are you doing?

311
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.625 line:82%
-Stop it, Bagga. Stop.
-Don't try to play it cool.

312
00:35:48.666 --> 00:35:49.750 line:82%
-You don't know who I am!
-Who are you?

313
00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:52.333 line:82%
-Stop it. Listen, man.
-Get off me!

314
00:35:52.375 --> 00:35:54.250 line:82%
Who do you think you are?

315
00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:57.708 line:82%
How dare you touch me?
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

316
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.375 line:82%
What are you looking at?
I'll kill you!

317
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.625 line:82%
-Cool down, man.
-Krish, Krish.

318
00:36:06.666 --> 00:36:08.500 line:82%
-Are you guys all right?
-Dev, are you okay?

319
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.916 line:82%
-What's happening, Krish?
-Hey, you okay?

320
00:36:10.958 --> 00:36:15.500 line:82%
Sorry, I was trying to explain
that the car had slipped on a stone

321
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:18.583 line:82%
and the driver
couldn't control it. I'm sorry.

322
00:36:20.875 --> 00:36:24.125 line:82%
Why was your car
in the middle of the road?

323
00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:26.791 line:82%
We were on our way to the Dhikala
guesthouse, the car broke down.

324
00:36:26.833 --> 00:36:31.041 line:82%
-We've been here for over an hour.
-Is there no help? I mean, phones?

325
00:36:31.083 --> 00:36:32.083 line:82%
There's no network here.

326
00:36:32.125 --> 00:36:34.916 line:82%
Madam, there are no phones
in the forest range.

327
00:36:34.958 --> 00:36:38.125 line:82%
And even if you found one, the rain
would have rendered it useless.

328
00:36:38.166 --> 00:36:40.666 line:82%
Anyone hurt?
You need any medication?

329
00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:44.625 line:82%
Thanks, we're all right.

330
00:36:44.666 --> 00:36:48.625 line:82%
It doesn't matter if it was
because of the accident or to help you,

331
00:36:48.666 --> 00:36:51.500 line:82%
we were destined to meet either way,
right, Dev?

332
00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:55.708 line:82%
We are going to the same place,
so we can give you a ride if you want.

333
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.916 line:82%
-I don't think we have a choice.
-Neither do we.

334
00:37:00.791 --> 00:37:05.083 line:82%
By the way, I'm God. Dev.

335
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:09.083 line:82%
Krish. My wife, Riya.

336
00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:12.208 line:82%
-Hi.
-Ishika!

337
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.083 line:82%
-Hi. Vishal!
-Sajid.

338
00:37:17.666 --> 00:37:22.958 line:82%
Listen. Just get the car to the guesthouse
after it's fixed.

339
00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:33.375 line:82%
Guys, you all carry on.
I'll catch up. Nature's call.

340
00:37:50.458 --> 00:37:51.708 line:82%
Stop the car.

341
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.750 line:82%
Back up.

342
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.166 line:82%
What happened?
Why are you backing up?

343
00:38:18.291 --> 00:38:19.750 line:82%
Please don't get down, sir.

344
00:38:19.791 --> 00:38:23.625 line:82%
It's just an illusion.
There's no paw print.

345
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.291 line:82%
The headlight on my car is broken.
We must leave before it gets dark.

346
00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:31.708 line:82%
I have to make arrangements
for your stay.

347
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:35.291 line:82%
As for your crazy driver, he must
have gone down to get some water.

348
00:38:35.333 --> 00:38:38.083 line:82%
-There's a stream there.
-Come on, Krish.

349
00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:41.541 line:82%
-Let's leave before it gets too late.
-Yes, let's leave.

350
00:38:41.583 --> 00:38:43.083 line:82%
There's nothing here. If it gets dark,
we will be in trouble.

351
00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:44.583 line:82%
Come on, Bagga. Start the car.

352
00:39:47.833 --> 00:39:52.458 line:82%
Pandey. D.S. Pandey.
World's best guide of forest.

353
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.291 line:82%
-Who?
-Myself, sir.

354
00:39:56.333 --> 00:40:01.833 line:82%
Orbit Park.
Land of tigers, isn't it?

355
00:40:01.875 --> 00:40:05.000 line:82%
Have you seen a tiger?
Has there been a sighting?

356
00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:06.875 line:82%
We have just arrived in the forest.

357
00:40:06.916 --> 00:40:11.708 line:82%
We haven't seen
the preserve yet. Tiger!

358
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.250 line:82%
I will take you tomorrow.
I guarantee you'll see a tiger.

359
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:18.500 line:82%
You must be saying that
to every tourist.

360
00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:21.166 line:82%
-How long have you been here?
-Two years.

361
00:40:21.208 --> 00:40:23.166 line:82%
So you have been fooling
the tourists for two years?

362
00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:25.333 line:82%
Smoke?

363
00:40:25.375 --> 00:40:26.958 line:82%
It kills.

364
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:35.500 line:82%
Pandey, there was an incident
two months ago.

365
00:40:35.541 --> 00:40:38.750 line:82%
Would you tell us more about it?

366
00:40:38.791 --> 00:40:41.791 line:82%
Oh, the one with the foreigners?

367
00:40:41.833 --> 00:40:44.250 line:82%
They deserved to die, sir.

368
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:47.250 line:82%
They think the forest is like a garden.

369
00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:50.666 line:82%
They were in the core area.
Route 5.

370
00:40:50.708 --> 00:40:54.000 line:82%
It's been marked as
the territory of the man-eater.

371
00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:56.500 line:82%
Now they walked up to the tiger.

372
00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:59.791 line:82%
They had to be eaten, right?

373
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:04.125 line:82%
But they say there have been more
accidents in the two months since then.

374
00:41:06.958 --> 00:41:12.833 line:82%
Well, if you aren't careful in the jungle,
anything can happen.

375
00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:16.041 line:82%
But this man-eater...

376
00:41:16.083 --> 00:41:20.500 line:82%
-The locals here say strange things.
-As I said,

377
00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:23.833 line:82%
it's a jungle area,
there are villages, mountains.

378
00:41:23.875 --> 00:41:27.083 line:82%
Anything can happen here.
You guys should enjoy yourselves.

379
00:41:28.083 --> 00:41:30.583 line:82%
-I want to see it.
-You want to see it?

380
00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:37.875 line:82%
Sure, why not? Tomorrow
I'll take you down route 5.

381
00:41:38.875 --> 00:41:42.416 line:82%
But, sir, remember it's the core area!

382
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:47.000 line:82%
Pandey, tell us a story
involving a tiger or a leopard.

383
00:41:47.041 --> 00:41:49.625 line:82%
Madam, Orbit has become
famous for no reason.

384
00:41:49.666 --> 00:41:53.625 line:82%
I have so many stories that a special park
can be opened in my name.

385
00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:58.958 line:82%
Daya Shankar Pandey
International Park!

386
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.833 line:82%
He speaks such nonsense.
I feel want to kill--

387
00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:07.041 line:82%
-Did you say anything?
-Nothing.

388
00:42:07.083 --> 00:42:09.958 line:82%
Madam, when you live in a forest,

389
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.958 line:82%
you encounter death at close quarters
every now and then.

390
00:42:14.166 --> 00:42:16.958 line:82%
Nobody move!
Nobody move!

391
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.958 line:82%
Sir, did you hear that roar?
Did you hear it?

392
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.791 line:82%
What's he talking about?

393
00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:24.833 line:82%
Where are you going, sir?

394
00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:27.916 line:82%
Where are you going?
Don't cross that fence.

395
00:42:27.958 --> 00:42:30.250 line:82%
It's dangerous beyond that!

396
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:32.375 line:82%
Silence, silence!

397
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.125 line:82%
-He's gone.
-Who?

398
00:42:38.166 --> 00:42:40.625 line:82%
He's gone towards the stream,
the tiger!

399
00:42:40.666 --> 00:42:44.000 line:82%
He has killed about two hours ago.

400
00:42:44.041 --> 00:42:47.083 line:82%
Now he's going to drink water.

401
00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:51.750 line:82%
-Do tigers come here?
-Don't worry, madam.

402
00:42:51.791 --> 00:42:55.625 line:82%
You know what?
Can you see that fence?

403
00:42:55.666 --> 00:43:00.041 line:82%
Tigers cannot come past that.
In any case, it's Pandey's territory.

404
00:43:00.083 --> 00:43:03.541 line:82%
Now there can't be two tigers
in one territory, can there?

405
00:44:57.666 --> 00:44:58.916 line:82%
It kills.

406
00:47:49.375 --> 00:47:54.041 line:82%
It's like the previous one.
Strange!

407
00:47:55.958 --> 00:48:01.708 line:82%
Usually it kills once a week,
twice at most.

408
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.625 line:82%
Sir, it looks like a tiger's kill.

409
00:48:05.666 --> 00:48:10.541 line:82%
It is a tiger's kill,
but it hasn't eaten him.

410
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:15.791 line:82%
It went for the neck...

411
00:48:15.833 --> 00:48:19.375 line:82%
until the head was severed
from the body.

412
00:48:21.375 --> 00:48:26.375 line:82%
The rain wiped out the paw prints.

413
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.791 line:82%
I don't understand.

414
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.083 line:82%
The forest has become dangerous
in the last two months.

415
00:48:42.083 --> 00:48:45.500 line:82%
Accidents have increased.

416
00:48:45.541 --> 00:48:50.625 line:82%
When a tiger turns into a man-eater,
it's difficult to control it.

417
00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:55.791 line:82%
And under what conditions does
a tiger turn into a man-eater?

418
00:48:55.833 --> 00:48:59.958 line:82%
Normally when it grows old
or when its teeth become weak,

419
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.958 line:82%
or at times due to the climate,
when food becomes scarce,

420
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.708 line:82%
it turns to humans.

421
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:11.833 line:82%
The bodies of the two foreigners
that were buried vanished after two days.

422
00:49:11.875 --> 00:49:15.791 line:82%
You seem to know a lot about this area.

423
00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:17.250 line:82%
Is it the same tiger?

424
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:20.208 line:82%
Can't say.

425
00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:25.708 line:82%
Maybe, maybe not.

426
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:29.208 line:82%
Yesterday the driver vanished
in front of my eyes.

427
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:34.000 line:82%
I'm sure even he became prey.

428
00:49:36.916 --> 00:49:39.250 line:82%
The forest preserve is closed
for tourists at this time.

429
00:49:39.291 --> 00:49:41.333 line:82%
You should leave now.

430
00:49:42.333 --> 00:49:44.416 line:82%
Mr. Khan, if we can be
of any help to you...

431
00:49:45.875 --> 00:49:50.083 line:82%
First help yourselves.
Leave before it gets too dangerous.

432
00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:51.833 line:82%
What do you mean?

433
00:49:56.541 --> 00:49:59.208 line:82%
It's in English
and on the reverse in Hindi too.

434
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:04.208 line:82%
Rule number one: Don't walk.
And the driver was on foot.

435
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:08.250 line:82%
When fate plots against you,
you don't get a second chance.

436
00:50:09.666 --> 00:50:14.250 line:82%
Tourists flout the rules
and the poor animal is blamed.

437
00:50:23.333 --> 00:50:27.750 line:82%
Dev, I'm worried about Sajid.
He left this morning.

438
00:50:30.541 --> 00:50:36.000 line:82%
He's gone towards the core area.
Must have gone hunting, the idiot!

439
00:50:36.041 --> 00:50:37.958 line:82%
Why didn't you stop him?

440
00:53:21.041 --> 00:53:23.250 line:82%
He took the forest ranger's jeep.

441
00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:26.541 line:82%
Where will we look for Sajid?
The core area is so large!

442
00:53:28.375 --> 00:53:31.208 line:82%
Bagga, be careful!
This is the wrong road!

443
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:33.458 line:82%
It's nothing, sir. Don't worry.

444
00:53:44.416 --> 00:53:46.208 line:82%
Sir, you will have to push.

445
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:49.958 line:82%
Dev! Krish! Stop being foolish.
Getting down here is suicide.

446
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.041 line:82%
Nothing will happen.
Come on, Krish, push!

447
00:53:58.166 --> 00:54:02.666 line:82%
This is the tiger hunting ground.
Anything can happen here.

448
00:54:03.666 --> 00:54:07.083 line:82%
Vishal, why don't you get off?
Are you scared?

449
00:54:07.125 --> 00:54:09.416 line:82%
If you have the guts,
why don't you get off and push?

450
00:54:31.166 --> 00:54:33.291 line:82%
Dev, that's enough.
Just come in now.

451
00:54:35.083 --> 00:54:38.541 line:82%
Krish, this is the sign of a kill.
Tigers can come anytime.

452
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.666 line:82%
Crap!

453
00:55:20.041 --> 00:55:22.916 line:82%
-Dev, careful.
-This is all we needed.

454
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:52.250 line:82%
Dev!

455
00:59:36.875 --> 00:59:37.958 line:82%
Who are you?

456
00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:41.416 line:82%
Kaali.

457
00:59:41.458 --> 00:59:43.791 line:82%
Kaali Pratap Singh.

458
00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:47.958 line:82%
Just give me your gun.

459
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.708 line:82%
It's mine.

460
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:51.750 line:82%
It's my jungle.

461
00:59:56.583 --> 01:00:00.500 line:82%
First mistake: It's the core area.

462
01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:04.375 line:82%
Second mistake:
You are carrying a gun.

463
01:00:04.416 --> 01:00:09.500 line:82%
Third mistake:
You are on foot without a guide.

464
01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:17.416 line:82%
I hate tourists that break the law.

465
01:00:17.458 --> 01:00:21.000 line:82%
We have come here for research.

466
01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:26.041 line:82%
Research? A lot of them
have come here for that.

467
01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:31.208 line:82%
How did it feel?
To see death up close?

468
01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:39.375 line:82%
Many times Death just touches you
and passes by and you don't even know it.

469
01:00:39.416 --> 01:00:42.375 line:82%
It gives you one more chance.

470
01:00:42.416 --> 01:00:47.166 line:82%
These... These tigers?

471
01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:52.416 line:82%
Tiger does not eat the prey
lying in front of it.

472
01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:54.833 line:82%
It plays with its kill.

473
01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:58.333 line:82%
First, it keeps watch.

474
01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:02.250 line:82%
Then it chooses its prey.

475
01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:05.250 line:82%
Then makes it run, tires it.

476
01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:11.125 line:82%
And when the prey is breathless,
it leaps on it.

477
01:01:11.166 --> 01:01:15.500 line:82%
And attacks the neck. Slowly.

478
01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:16.583 line:82%
Stop it.

479
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.500 line:82%
You are on foot here.

480
01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:25.166 line:82%
The jungle is Kaali's home.

481
01:01:25.208 --> 01:01:30.000 line:82%
You guys leave now. I might not be able
to save you next time.

482
01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:32.166 line:82%
Do you know the road? Or would you
like me to come with you?

483
01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:36.083 line:82%
No, we are fine.
We don't need you.

484
01:01:38.666 --> 01:01:42.833 line:82%
One, two, three, four, five.

485
01:01:42.875 --> 01:01:46.625 line:82%
What are you counting?

486
01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:48.541 line:82%
What are you staring at?

487
01:01:50.041 --> 01:01:55.708 line:82%
Some people come here to hunt
and become the hunted.

488
01:01:55.750 --> 01:02:00.583 line:82%
Go carefully.
If you live, we'll meet again.

489
01:02:35.958 --> 01:02:38.208 line:82%
Stop the car. Stop!

490
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.000 line:82%
That's Khan's jeep. Sajid must be
somewhere here. Sajid!

491
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:42.958 line:82%
-Sajid!
-Sajid!

492
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.375 line:82%
-Sajid! Sajid!
-Sajid!

493
01:02:47.166 --> 01:02:49.500 line:82%
Sajid!

494
01:02:49.541 --> 01:02:53.291 line:82%
-Sajid!
-Sajid!

495
01:02:53.333 --> 01:02:57.708 line:82%
-Sajid!
-Sajid!

496
01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:02.041 line:82%
-Sajid!
-Sajid!

497
01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.833 line:82%
-Sajid!
-Sajid!

498
01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:09.166 line:82%
Hunting. The mad fool!

499
01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:11.208 line:82%
Sajid!

500
01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.666 line:82%
Sajid!

501
01:03:20.458 --> 01:03:23.458 line:82%
-Sajid!
-Sajid! Sajid!

502
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.500 line:82%
-Sajid!
-Sajid!

503
01:03:25.541 --> 01:03:27.000 line:82%
Sajid!

504
01:03:33.666 --> 01:03:35.000 line:82%
Sajid?

505
01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:44.208 line:82%
Sajid?

506
01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:49.083 line:82%
Sajid!

507
01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:55.833 line:82%
Sajid!

508
01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:18.333 line:82%
Never seen or heardof this kind of killing.

509
01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:22.041 line:82%
The feeling that something strange wasafoot increased with each passing moment.

510
01:04:22.083 --> 01:04:25.500 line:82%
Perhaps I was somewhere closeto the truth.

511
01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:28.750 line:82%
If this wasn't the act of any tigeror animal...

512
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.041 line:82%
then who could it be?

513
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:40.291 line:82%
I warned you earlier,
but you didn't listen.

514
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:42.125 line:82%
This is a jungle, not a hill station.

515
01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:45.000 line:82%
The weather is going to get worse.

516
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:50.250 line:82%
Leave, before you become four
instead of five.

517
01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:52.583 line:82%
But Sajid's death...

518
01:05:52.625 --> 01:05:57.000 line:82%
What can you do?
What had to happen, happened.

519
01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:59.750 line:82%
This is the only way to reach the gate.

520
01:05:59.791 --> 01:06:02.791 line:82%
There are reports of landslides.
The road can shut anytime.

521
01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:06.958 line:82%
The other route has a river on its way.
It can get flooded.

522
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.291 line:82%
-You'll never be able to get out then.
-All right.

523
01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:14.041 line:82%
We will leave soon.

524
01:06:16.083 --> 01:06:19.833 line:82%
All the best.
Have a safe journey.

525
01:06:20.833 --> 01:06:23.041 line:82%
Mr. Khan, thank you.

526
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.750 line:82%
You have very little time.
Goodbye.

527
01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:50.375 line:82%
Ishika.

528
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.416 line:82%
Please take me away from here, Dev.

529
01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.625 line:82%
Sajid...

530
01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:11.375 line:82%
We are getting out of here.
Right now. Okay?

531
01:07:15.208 --> 01:07:21.208 line:82%
Vishal, come on, pack your things.
Get ready to leave.

532
01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:26.791 line:82%
Vishal?

533
01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:32.625 line:82%
Vishal. Vishal!

534
01:07:34.166 --> 01:07:35.208 line:82%
Sajid...

535
01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:42.750 line:82%
-Vishal.
-Dev, Sajid.

536
01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:44.500 line:82%
Dev, Sajid.

537
01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:46.625 line:82%
-Vishal!
-Dev, Sajid.

538
01:07:46.666 --> 01:07:47.708 line:82%
Dev...

539
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:49.458 line:82%
He was a fool.

540
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.208 line:82%
I warned him his habit
would get him in trouble.

541
01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.208 line:82%
We have to leave. Come on.

542
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:57.000 line:82%
How did you get the gun?

543
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.250 line:82%
What?

544
01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:09.416 line:82%
Well, we were going to the farmhouse,
so I kept it.

545
01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:12.250 line:82%
It could come in handy.

546
01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:14.791 line:82%
And it did. So?

547
01:08:15.833 --> 01:08:19.250 line:82%
You were angry with Sajid
because he had a gun.

548
01:08:21.041 --> 01:08:24.083 line:82%
He used to keep it for poaching
and I keep it for safety.

549
01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:27.958 line:82%
A weapon is a weapon.

550
01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:30.750 line:82%
Whatever!

551
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:37.875 line:82%
The driver, Pandey, Sajid...

552
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:42.500 line:82%
Who's next, Dev?

553
01:08:42.541 --> 01:08:44.958 line:82%
What? What do you mean?

554
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.916 line:82%
Yesterday, you had a problem
with the driver.

555
01:08:50.791 --> 01:08:52.375 line:82%
He vanished.

556
01:08:54.541 --> 01:08:58.166 line:82%
Last night you felt like killing Pandey.

557
01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:04.333 line:82%
And you hated Sajid's passion
for hunting anyway.

558
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.375 line:82%
What are you trying to say?

559
01:09:08.416 --> 01:09:12.041 line:82%
That I did all this? Me?

560
01:09:16.458 --> 01:09:20.125 line:82%
I killed everyone? Is that
what you're trying to say?

561
01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:23.625 line:82%
Have I lost it? Have I gone mad?

562
01:09:23.666 --> 01:09:26.750 line:82%
You are losing it, Krish.

563
01:09:26.791 --> 01:09:30.958 line:82%
And if you say one more word,
I'll kill you.

564
01:09:35.208 --> 01:09:38.333 line:82%
I saw you going towards Pandey
last night.

565
01:09:40.583 --> 01:09:43.166 line:82%
-You damn...
-Dev! Krish! Stop it!

566
01:09:43.208 --> 01:09:45.625 line:82%
-Are you insane? What are you doing?
-Just stop it, okay?

567
01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:53.041 line:82%
Listen, no one is sadder
about Sajid's death than me.

568
01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:58.500 line:82%
He was a crazy guy, but he
was my closest friend. Understand?

569
01:09:59.625 --> 01:10:01.291 line:82%
Yes, Sajid was very close to us.

570
01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:05.500 line:82%
Dev would never
even think of killing him.

571
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:10.375 line:82%
Please stop fighting.
I can't breathe.

572
01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:15.333 line:82%
Dev, please get me out of here.
I want to go home.

573
01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:19.791 line:82%
Krish, you know
that this is the work of a tiger.

574
01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:21.208 line:82%
An animal can't do this.

575
01:10:22.625 --> 01:10:28.375 line:82%
Krish, research, passion, profession
all this is fine up to a point.

576
01:10:29.666 --> 01:10:33.291 line:82%
We know there are some strange things
happening in the jungle,

577
01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:37.208 line:82%
but we never thought
it would happen to one of us.

578
01:10:38.458 --> 01:10:41.750 line:82%
We have to leave
before it gets too late.

579
01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:45.083 line:82%
Didn't you hear
what Khan said before he left?

580
01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:51.541 line:82%
If you want to live, leave.
If you want to die, then stay.

581
01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:54.958 line:82%
Come on, Vishal.

582
01:11:04.666 --> 01:11:06.208 line:82%
Come on, Krish.

583
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500 line:82%
Krish...

584
01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:17.041 line:82%
I know our project is incomplete...

585
01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:22.875 line:82%
but we must leave right now.

586
01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:28.041 line:82%
It's dangerous to spend even one more day
in this jungle.

587
01:11:30.666 --> 01:11:33.541 line:82%
Let's leave, please.

588
01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.333 line:82%
Everything will be all right.

589
01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:43.750 line:82%
-Vishal!
-Sajid?

590
01:11:43.791 --> 01:11:45.000 line:82%
-Vishal! Vishal!
-Sajid?

591
01:11:45.041 --> 01:11:47.166 line:82%
Sajid!

592
01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:50.291 line:82%
-Come on! Hurry up!
-Vishal? Vishal!

593
01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:52.666 line:82%
There's nobody there, Vishal!

594
01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:56.833 line:82%
Vishal, where are you going?
Take me along.

595
01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:58.583 line:82%
-Hurry up!
-Sajid isn't there, Vishal.

596
01:11:58.625 --> 01:12:02.458 line:82%
-Let me go, Dev!
-There's nobody there, Vishal!

597
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:06.166 line:82%
Sajid, hurry up!
Why don't you stop the jeep?

598
01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:10.666 line:82%
Sajid! Sajid! Come.

599
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:47.125 line:82%
Landslide. Khan was right.

600
01:12:48.375 --> 01:12:52.000 line:82%
Sir, if we'd been here earlier,
we would've been buried under it.

601
01:12:52.041 --> 01:12:57.166 line:82%
-We'll have to take route B.
-Dev, I doubt this is the right way.

602
01:12:57.208 --> 01:12:59.166 line:82%
To me, all the roads look the same.

603
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:05.666 line:82%
"The path you chose to tread on,
though reluctantly perhaps,

604
01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:10.541 line:82%
it still leads you closer to her!
Even if fate shows you the signs.

605
01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:14.500 line:82%
You can neither see or dream
what's ahead in your life.

606
01:13:14.541 --> 01:13:19.750 line:82%
You've just finished living
the few moments that were loaned to you.

607
01:13:19.791 --> 01:13:23.791 line:82%
She will take you away, no doubt.
Just look at your palm.

608
01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:28.041 line:82%
The line that chained you to life
no longer exists.

609
01:13:28.083 --> 01:13:30.583 line:82%
Come, embrace me.

610
01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:34.458 line:82%
I am your end."

611
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:38.333 line:82%
It's a poem, sir.
Didn't you read it in school?

612
01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:42.208 line:82%
I told you we'd meet again
if you survived, didn't I?

613
01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:46.625 line:82%
You are alive,
and we have met again.

614
01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:52.958 line:82%
When an animal is killed in the jungle,
no man knows about it.

615
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.750 line:82%
But when a human is killed,
all the animals know about it.

616
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.375 line:82%
What happened to your friend was sad.

617
01:14:04.166 --> 01:14:09.166 line:82%
Earlier I mentioned that some people
come here to hunt,

618
01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:10.750 line:82%
and become the hunted.

619
01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:12.583 line:82%
Which road leads to the gate?

620
01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:17.208 line:82%
The jungle is bad. It's hungry.

621
01:14:19.041 --> 01:14:21.375 line:82%
Which is the road to the gate?

622
01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:29.125 line:82%
Route B is shut down due to flooding.

623
01:14:29.166 --> 01:14:31.416 line:82%
The bridge has collapsed,
getting out is difficult.

624
01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:35.250 line:82%
Difficult? What's difficult?

625
01:14:37.041 --> 01:14:41.083 line:82%
I know a way, a shortcut.

626
01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:45.166 line:82%
But I won't take you that way.
It's dangerous.

627
01:14:50.541 --> 01:14:52.833 line:82%
We have to get out of here.

628
01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:57.125 line:82%
No, sir. I'm not going to put you
in danger for that amount.

629
01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:12.083 line:82%
The route is very dangerous.
It goes through the core area.

630
01:15:13.166 --> 01:15:15.708 line:82%
Some strange incidents have occurred
in the last two months.

631
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:19.708 line:82%
Cut the crap. Take us if you
want, if not...

632
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:24.291 line:82%
Some very weird incidents
have happened. Village gossip.

633
01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:28.500 line:82%
-But I don't believe them.
-Skip the nonsense.

634
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:32.041 line:82%
Lead us, quietly. If you want
more money, you will get it.

635
01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:36.833 line:82%
What's money, sir?
All that matters is life.

636
01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:38.833 line:82%
If there is life, there is the world.

637
01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:42.833 line:82%
-How boring! I want to kill--
-Dev, calm down.

638
01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:47.750 line:82%
Sir, he is from the jungle.
Maybe he's right.

639
01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:10.458 line:82%
Last year around the same time,
there was a camp from the college.

640
01:16:11.458 --> 01:16:14.333 line:82%
They lost their way
and were searching around, like you did.

641
01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:16.458 line:82%
They were caught in a landslide.

642
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.583 line:82%
Three months later when the forest
preserve opened, they only found the bus.

643
01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:23.041 line:82%
Not even the bones are spared
in the jungle.

644
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:27.500 line:82%
Another thing. It's important
to know the correct way.

645
01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:30.625 line:82%
It's foolish to trust the roads here.

646
01:16:30.666 --> 01:16:33.625 line:82%
You never know when a tree
will fall down and close the road.

647
01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:39.666 line:82%
Apart from the wild animals,

648
01:16:39.708 --> 01:16:42.625 line:82%
there are a lot of other beings
you need to be careful about.

649
01:16:42.666 --> 01:16:43.875 line:82%
Other beings? Meaning?

650
01:16:43.916 --> 01:16:48.791 line:82%
You, me. Humans!
The most dangerous of all.

651
01:16:50.291 --> 01:16:54.750 line:82%
Research, hunting, business
could only be a facade.

652
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:56.166 line:82%
You can't trust humans.

653
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.833 line:82%
Your friend made a tiny mistake
and paid for it in spades.

654
01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:08.333 line:82%
Nature makes a rule, man breaks it.
He never learns.

655
01:17:12.958 --> 01:17:15.541 line:82%
Hey, easy on the speed.

656
01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:18.583 line:82%
Bagga, are you crazy?

657
01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:23.375 line:82%
Bagga, careful!

658
01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:26.541 line:82%
What are you doing?

659
01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:39.375 line:82%
It's okay. You're okay?

660
01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:47.541 line:82%
Whatever happens
happens for the best.

661
01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:51.791 line:82%
We stopped at the right place.

662
01:17:58.708 --> 01:18:03.208 line:82%
This is the wooden bridge.
We'll wait here till the jeep is repaired.

663
01:18:04.208 --> 01:18:05.708 line:82%
Then we'll cross the river.

664
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:10.125 line:82%
There's too much water.
They must be lying there, waiting.

665
01:18:10.166 --> 01:18:13.000 line:82%
Who? Who must be waiting?

666
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.125 line:82%
The crocodiles.

667
01:18:27.541 --> 01:18:32.041 line:82%
I don't know why I feel
there's danger at every corner.

668
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.208 line:82%
Crocodiles are all right,

669
01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:43.708 line:82%
but is there any other danger here?

670
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.750 line:82%
Krish. You scared me.

671
01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:19.166 line:82%
I want to go home right now.

672
01:19:21.708 --> 01:19:24.166 line:82%
Riya, don't worry.

673
01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:27.333 line:82%
You're just scared.
Am I not with you?

674
01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:33.208 line:82%
That's what scares me the most.
If something happens to you...

675
01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:37.583 line:82%
Just a few more hours.

676
01:19:37.625 --> 01:19:43.166 line:82%
Then everything will be over.
Please don't be troubled.

677
01:20:01.875 --> 01:20:03.125 line:82%
Bagga.

678
01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:07.041 line:82%
Bagga, is the jeep repaired?

679
01:20:07.083 --> 01:20:11.250 line:82%
The connection is broken.
It'll take time.

680
01:20:14.166 --> 01:20:17.500 line:82%
-How long are we going to be stuck here?
-Just a bit longer.

681
01:20:17.541 --> 01:20:21.291 line:82%
It's getting colder, warm yourselves.
You may not get a chance again.

682
01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:24.250 line:82%
Can we get something to eat here?

683
01:20:26.166 --> 01:20:29.500 line:82%
Has my father set up a restaurant
in the middle of the jungle?

684
01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:31.166 line:82%
Kaali...

685
01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:34.500 line:82%
I want to know something.

686
01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:37.625 line:82%
Sit down.

687
01:20:42.208 --> 01:20:45.625 line:82%
The circumstances
in which Pandey and Sajid died,

688
01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:48.125 line:82%
-do you think a tiger--
-I told you earlier.

689
01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:52.333 line:82%
It's not an animal.

690
01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:59.208 line:82%
What do you know?
I want to know everything.

691
01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:05.916 line:82%
Forget it, sir.
You won't believe it.

692
01:21:09.791 --> 01:21:11.041 line:82%
What's this?

693
01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:13.375 line:82%
You keep throwing money at me.

694
01:21:16.875 --> 01:21:21.750 line:82%
Two months ago,
two foreigners had a accident.

695
01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:26.833 line:82%
They were killed by a tiger.

696
01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:32.500 line:82%
There was a guide with them.
People say he was mad.

697
01:21:32.541 --> 01:21:35.291 line:82%
Why?

698
01:21:35.333 --> 01:21:38.125 line:82%
Poaching and hunting were on the rise.

699
01:21:38.166 --> 01:21:41.083 line:82%
Lack of food was killing the animals.

700
01:21:42.833 --> 01:21:47.000 line:82%
If it is left to the humans,
they will turn a jungle into a city.

701
01:21:49.166 --> 01:21:50.708 line:82%
He couldn't bear that.

702
01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:55.500 line:82%
He had lived all his life in the jungle,
this was his home.

703
01:21:55.541 --> 01:21:57.708 line:82%
He would mislead the tourists.

704
01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:00.625 line:82%
A lot of people died
because of his madness.

705
01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:04.791 line:82%
The danger was on the rise.

706
01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:09.166 line:82%
Kill him. Mad man!

707
01:22:10.666 --> 01:22:13.708 line:82%
Kill him! Kill him!

708
01:22:18.875 --> 01:22:21.500 line:82%
They slashed his neck.

709
01:22:21.541 --> 01:22:26.791 line:82%
-Was he really mad?
-I don't think so.

710
01:22:26.833 --> 01:22:29.500 line:82%
Hey, cut the crap.
If your story is over--

711
01:22:29.541 --> 01:22:31.458 line:82%
It's not over yet, just hear it out.

712
01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:37.250 line:82%
Since then, the villagers say
that his spirit will kill everyone.

713
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:40.166 line:82%
Just shut up. Give me a break.
He's talking nonsense.

714
01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:42.791 line:82%
Just trying to scare the girls.
It's crap.

715
01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.041 line:82%
Stop scaring us, please.

716
01:22:45.083 --> 01:22:46.958 line:82%
Krish, I don't want to hear any more.

717
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.375 line:82%
Didn't I say you wouldn't believe it?

718
01:22:51.416 --> 01:22:56.125 line:82%
You're city folks.
But one day, you'll believe it.

719
01:22:56.166 --> 01:22:58.041 line:82%
I'll go find some food.

720
01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:02.041 line:82%
I'm tired, Dev.

721
01:23:06.875 --> 01:23:09.916 line:82%
-Please don't leave me.
-I'm right here.

722
01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:51.291 line:82%
Dev. Dev!

723
01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:54.041 line:82%
Dev!

724
01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:57.416 line:82%
Dev!

725
01:23:59.375 --> 01:24:00.791 line:82%
Dev!

726
01:24:09.625 --> 01:24:11.250 line:82%
Dev!

727
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:14.125 line:82%
Vishal!

728
01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:23.791 line:82%
Dev!

729
01:25:45.416 --> 01:25:48.958 line:82%
Ishk, what happened?
I'm here. I'm okay.

730
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.500 line:82%
What's the matter, baby?

731
01:25:52.875 --> 01:25:56.000 line:82%
What happened?
Ishk, what happened?

732
01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:59.500 line:82%
-You must've had a nightmare.
-Are you all right?

733
01:25:59.541 --> 01:26:01.166 line:82%
Calm down.

734
01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:02.833 line:82%
Bagga!

735
01:26:05.041 --> 01:26:06.375 line:82%
Bagga!

736
01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:11.083 line:82%
This is Bagga's. I wonder why--

737
01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:14.416 line:82%
He's dead. He's been killed too.

738
01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:20.041 line:82%
We're all gonna die.
We're gonna die!

739
01:26:20.083 --> 01:26:23.500 line:82%
-Krish, is he--
-How can that be, Riya?

740
01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:26.041 line:82%
We were all here.
Nothing happened in our presence.

741
01:26:26.083 --> 01:26:29.416 line:82%
Sir, what you see
is not what happens.

742
01:26:29.458 --> 01:26:33.625 line:82%
And what you don't see,
you don't believe.

743
01:26:33.666 --> 01:26:36.750 line:82%
Bagga must have satisfied
some wild animal's hunger.

744
01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:40.250 line:82%
-Good, at least he was of some use.
-Shut your trap.

745
01:26:41.375 --> 01:26:43.500 line:82%
You're the only one that understands
what you say.

746
01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:49.375 line:82%
Not necessarily.

747
01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:54.333 line:82%
Bagga!

748
01:26:56.083 --> 01:27:00.833 line:82%
Once we cross this bridge,
there's an old guesthouse.

749
01:27:00.875 --> 01:27:03.291 line:82%
The gate is only
two kilometers from there.

750
01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:09.125 line:82%
-But is it safe with the river so high?
-We must leave before it gets dark.

751
01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:13.833 line:82%
That's the first time you've said
something sensible. We should leave.

752
01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:19.041 line:82%
I don't want the lady to be troubled
anymore. It's time to leave.

753
01:27:19.083 --> 01:27:21.833 line:82%
But the jeep can get stuck in the water.
Let's wait for a while.

754
01:27:21.875 --> 01:27:24.500 line:82%
No. We can't stay here.

755
01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:30.250 line:82%
It's river water, anything can happen.

756
01:27:30.291 --> 01:27:32.250 line:82%
You can't have it both ways.

757
01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:38.041 line:82%
I'm just saying it's dangerous
to make a move,

758
01:27:38.083 --> 01:27:40.458 line:82%
but we have no choice.

759
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.291 line:82%
You guys decide what to do.

760
01:27:50.333 --> 01:27:53.166 line:82%
Vishal, wait!
The bridge is weak, let me drive.

761
01:27:54.875 --> 01:27:59.625 line:82%
We can't trust the waters.
Trust me, wait a while.

762
01:27:59.666 --> 01:28:03.500 line:82%
I don't trust anyone anymore.

763
01:28:03.541 --> 01:28:07.500 line:82%
-I want to live.
-Don't be stupid, Vishal. It's risky.

764
01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:11.625 line:82%
Looks like Kaali's words
have scared you. I'm leaving.

765
01:28:11.666 --> 01:28:16.791 line:82%
Sir, I'll come with you.
But don't say I didn't warn you.

766
01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:20.416 line:82%
I'm leaving.
If you want to come, join me.

767
01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:25.833 line:82%
Vishal, I'm telling you!
Let me drive.

768
01:28:25.875 --> 01:28:27.583 line:82%
Vishal, just go slow.

769
01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:35.333 line:82%
Careful. Slow down. Slow.

770
01:28:35.375 --> 01:28:37.166 line:82%
The wood is wet, the bridge is weak.

771
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.541 line:82%
Vishal! What are you doing?

772
01:28:47.041 --> 01:28:49.625 line:82%
Vishal, what are you doing?
Are you nuts? Go slow.

773
01:28:50.875 --> 01:28:53.458 line:82%
Stop the car. Let me drive.

774
01:29:05.416 --> 01:29:06.500 line:82%
Vishal!

775
01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:20.500 line:82%
-Everybody, just get out of the car!
-I'll remove it.

776
01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:23.333 line:82%
Get off the vehicle! Ishika!

777
01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:25.583 line:82%
Come on, everybody, get off.
Get out of the car, come on!

778
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.833 line:82%
-I'll take it out!
-Come on. Give me your hand.

779
01:29:30.875 --> 01:29:32.833 line:82%
Come on, Vish! Come on!

780
01:29:39.083 --> 01:29:40.416 line:82%
-Where are you guys going?
-Vishal.

781
01:29:42.625 --> 01:29:45.208 line:82%
Start, start. Goddamn it!

782
01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:47.458 line:82%
-Vishal, what are you doing? Come on!
-Don't go. I'm telling you.

783
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.791 line:82%
-Come on, Vishal, don't be foolish!
-Give me a hand.

784
01:29:49.833 --> 01:29:51.166 line:82%
-Vishal!
-I'll save you!

785
01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:52.208 line:82%
Vishal!

786
01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.541 line:82%
Come on, Vishal, give me your hand.

787
01:29:55.541 --> 01:29:58.541 line:82%
No, I won't go.
You are making a mistake.

788
01:29:58.583 --> 01:30:01.208 line:82%
-Vishal, get out of there!
-You are making a mistake. Come back!

789
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:02.416 line:82%
The bridge is weak. Come on!

790
01:30:02.458 --> 01:30:05.875 line:82%
Start, goddamn it!
Start! Come on!

791
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:08.791 line:82%
He's going to die!

792
01:30:10.125 --> 01:30:13.416 line:82%
-Ishika, come here!
-Stop being foolish! Get off!

793
01:30:14.458 --> 01:30:15.833 line:82%
Vishal!

794
01:30:15.875 --> 01:30:18.208 line:82%
-Start! Goddamn it!
-Get out of the car!

795
01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:19.250 line:82%
Vishal, come on!

796
01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:21.250 line:82%
Vishal!

797
01:30:27.791 --> 01:30:29.250 line:82%
-Vishal!
-Vishal!

798
01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:34.583 line:82%
-Vishal! Vishal!
-No, Dev!

799
01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:39.125 line:82%
-Calm down, Dev!
-Let me go! Vishal!

800
01:30:41.291 --> 01:30:44.875 line:82%
-Vishal! Vishal... Vishal...
-Vishal!

801
01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:49.000 line:82%
Vishal!

802
01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:52.541 line:82%
Vishal...

803
01:31:12.875 --> 01:31:14.250 line:82%
-Vishal, come out!
-Vishal!

804
01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:18.250 line:82%
Hurry up!

805
01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.583 line:82%
Quickly!

806
01:31:26.666 --> 01:31:28.208 line:82%
Come out!

807
01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.583 line:82%
Come on, Vishal!

808
01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:37.666 line:82%
Dev. Ishika.

809
01:31:42.375 --> 01:31:45.666 line:82%
Come on, Vishal.
Come out, Vishal

810
01:31:47.958 --> 01:31:50.500 line:82%
Come on, Vishal!

811
01:31:50.541 --> 01:31:55.041 line:82%
Vishal, why didn't you take me?Why did you leave me alone?

812
01:31:55.083 --> 01:31:58.500 line:82%
Vishal! Vishal!

813
01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:15.750 line:82%
No!

814
01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.500 line:82%
Come on, Vishal!

815
01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:30.625 line:82%
Dev! I'm alive!

816
01:32:30.666 --> 01:32:33.458 line:82%
-Come on, Vishal!
-Dev, I'm coming!

817
01:32:34.875 --> 01:32:37.000 line:82%
-Come!
-I won't let anyone die!

818
01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:06.500 line:82%
He's right!
It's going to kill all of us.

819
01:34:06.541 --> 01:34:10.083 line:82%
Nothing is going to happen.
I won't let anything to happen to you.

820
01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:13.750 line:82%
-It will kill all of us.
-He was innocent.

821
01:34:16.875 --> 01:34:18.958 line:82%
He acted so foolishly.

822
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.708 line:82%
I had warned you all.

823
01:34:21.958 --> 01:34:24.708 line:82%
It's a violent river,
anything can happen.

824
01:34:28.458 --> 01:34:29.541 line:82%
Isn't it, sir?

825
01:34:35.291 --> 01:34:38.750 line:82%
Cold piercing water,

826
01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:41.541 line:82%
like a sword drawn
by some mysterious power.

827
01:34:41.583 --> 01:34:43.250 line:82%
Such a death!

828
01:34:43.291 --> 01:34:49.291 line:82%
Like you said, we should've waited.
He would probably have been saved.

829
01:34:50.458 --> 01:34:54.875 line:82%
But we had to leave before dark.

830
01:34:54.916 --> 01:35:00.250 line:82%
In this situation, I think even I
am going to be in trouble.

831
01:35:00.291 --> 01:35:01.666 line:82%
Shall we?

832
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:23.583 line:82%
There was this honeymoon couple
from Nainital.

833
01:35:23.625 --> 01:35:26.583 line:82%
Their car broke down on the way,
in the dark.

834
01:35:26.625 --> 01:35:28.500 line:82%
And they had to walk.

835
01:35:28.541 --> 01:35:31.625 line:82%
In the morning,
first they found the boy's hand.

836
01:35:31.666 --> 01:35:35.416 line:82%
-And then the girl's head.
-Then?

837
01:35:35.458 --> 01:35:37.916 line:82%
What then? That was
the end of the honeymoon!

838
01:35:37.958 --> 01:35:39.750 line:82%
Enough!

839
01:35:39.791 --> 01:35:44.291 line:82%
I've had enough!
Just shut up or I'll kill you.

840
01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:52.041 line:82%
Oh, no, you cannot kill
an already lifeless poor man.

841
01:35:52.083 --> 01:35:55.125 line:82%
Your friend died,
and you're taking it out on me, eh?

842
01:35:55.166 --> 01:36:01.166 line:82%
I just wanted to tell you how risky
it is to walk, but we have no choice.

843
01:36:40.291 --> 01:36:42.000 line:82%
Krish...

844
01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:45.500 line:82%
Water.

845
01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:54.541 line:82%
Sir, be careful.

846
01:36:54.583 --> 01:36:56.958 line:82%
Where there is water,
there are animals.

847
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.041 line:82%
Did you have to say that?

848
01:38:16.041 --> 01:38:18.041 line:82%
What happened? What happened?

849
01:38:20.208 --> 01:38:21.541 line:82%
What happened?

850
01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:29.458 line:82%
-Water.
-What?

851
01:38:30.791 --> 01:38:32.250 line:82%
The driver.

852
01:38:36.666 --> 01:38:38.041 line:82%
There's nobody there.

853
01:38:42.666 --> 01:38:44.000 line:82%
It's nothing.

854
01:38:48.291 --> 01:38:52.250 line:82%
It happens.
Death, fear, shock.

855
01:38:52.291 --> 01:38:55.833 line:82%
You imagine strange things.
It's just fear.

856
01:39:01.166 --> 01:39:03.166 line:82%
Let's go. Come.

857
01:39:07.791 --> 01:39:09.041 line:82%
Come.

858
01:40:22.083 --> 01:40:24.250 line:82%
Don't go near the well.

859
01:40:24.291 --> 01:40:25.750 line:82%
Why?

860
01:40:25.791 --> 01:40:28.208 line:82%
There are a lot of stories about it.
You want to hear them?

861
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:31.625 line:82%
Keep your tall tales with you.
They're all crap.

862
01:40:31.666 --> 01:40:35.083 line:82%
I keep talking,
but you guys don't listen.

863
01:40:35.125 --> 01:40:37.416 line:82%
What did you say?

864
01:40:37.458 --> 01:40:39.708 line:82%
Nothing. Just don't go near the well.

865
01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:00.625 line:82%
I can't forget Vishal and Sajid.

866
01:41:00.666 --> 01:41:04.416 line:82%
Why is this happening to us?

867
01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:09.000 line:82%
Just sleep for a while.
Everything will be all right.

868
01:41:18.625 --> 01:41:19.875 line:82%
What's the matter?

869
01:41:19.916 --> 01:41:25.125 line:82%
Riya, today I realized how much
you mean to me.

870
01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.875 line:82%
I have never seen death
so close before.

871
01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:34.500 line:82%
I realized I can't live if I lose you.

872
01:41:35.875 --> 01:41:37.750 line:82%
We will always be together.

873
01:41:43.541 --> 01:41:45.375 line:82%
Now your Krish will change.

874
01:41:46.541 --> 01:41:49.500 line:82%
He will now concentrate on his Riya,

875
01:41:49.541 --> 01:41:51.541 line:82%
before all the snakes,
scorpions and tigers.

876
01:46:42.458 --> 01:46:43.833 line:82%
Riya?

877
01:46:47.208 --> 01:46:49.500 line:82%
Riya?

878
01:46:49.541 --> 01:46:50.791 line:82%
Riya!

879
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:54.000 line:82%
Riya!

880
01:46:54.041 --> 01:46:57.250 line:82%
-What happened, Krish?
-Perhaps the tiger took her.

881
01:46:57.291 --> 01:47:00.416 line:82%
Why? This time your other beings
haven't done anything?

882
01:47:03.541 --> 01:47:06.375 line:82%
So... you do believe me.

883
01:47:11.666 --> 01:47:15.000 line:82%
Don't go near the well, sir.
I warned you earlier too.

884
01:47:32.333 --> 01:47:36.000 line:82%
Riya! Riya!

885
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:24.791 line:82%
Don't go on foot,
don't go near the river,

886
01:48:24.833 --> 01:48:27.958 line:82%
don't go near the well.

887
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.375 line:82%
You did everything that was prohibited.

888
01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:36.041 line:82%
I slept a short while.

889
01:48:36.083 --> 01:48:40.375 line:82%
I'd have helped her
if she'd only asked.

890
01:48:41.458 --> 01:48:44.625 line:82%
I warned her not to go to the well.
She had to die there.

891
01:48:44.666 --> 01:48:47.083 line:82%
Kaali!

892
01:48:47.125 --> 01:48:49.625 line:82%
What are you screaming Kaali for?

893
01:48:49.666 --> 01:48:52.666 line:82%
People are dying here
and you are angry with me.

894
01:48:57.666 --> 01:49:02.333 line:82%
There's only one thing you can't trust
in this world. Death.

895
01:49:02.375 --> 01:49:04.791 line:82%
You never know when, where,
and how she comes.

896
01:49:05.833 --> 01:49:10.083 line:82%
She must have been parched,
wanted to have some water.

897
01:49:10.125 --> 01:49:14.625 line:82%
If she'd only known she'd find
so much water that it'd kill her...

898
01:49:26.125 --> 01:49:28.416 line:82%
You cannot killan already lifeless, poor man.

899
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:35.458 line:82%
Sir, what you see is not what happens.

900
01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:40.500 line:82%
And what you don't see,you don't believe.

901
01:49:43.166 --> 01:49:46.250 line:82%
You cannot killan already lifeless poor man.

902
01:49:46.291 --> 01:49:49.833 line:82%
Come, embrace me. I am your end.

903
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:08.083 line:82%
Kaali, you brought us this far.

904
01:50:09.666 --> 01:50:13.125 line:82%
You helped us a lot.

905
01:50:14.541 --> 01:50:16.250 line:82%
Thank you very much.

906
01:50:17.875 --> 01:50:21.791 line:82%
That's my duty, I'm your guide.

907
01:50:22.791 --> 01:50:25.000 line:82%
But the journey isn't over.

908
01:50:25.041 --> 01:50:27.333 line:82%
I have to guide the three of you
to the end of your journey.

909
01:50:30.375 --> 01:50:36.208 line:82%
Kaali, just one more favor.

910
01:50:37.791 --> 01:50:41.416 line:82%
If you can get us some wood...

911
01:50:43.875 --> 01:50:46.583 line:82%
we can do the final rites for Riya.

912
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.208 line:82%
I'll look on this side.

913
01:50:53.041 --> 01:50:57.291 line:82%
You look over there.

914
01:50:57.333 --> 01:51:01.250 line:82%
Sure, sir.
We will need a lot of wood.

915
01:51:02.625 --> 01:51:03.958 line:82%
Why?

916
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.583 line:82%
There's three of you. We will need
torches in the dark.

917
01:51:11.125 --> 01:51:14.416 line:82%
The road on the right is our road.

918
01:51:14.458 --> 01:51:17.375 line:82%
I'll be right back.

919
01:51:17.416 --> 01:51:22.833 line:82%
Here, in the hills, they say
that if the last rites are not done,

920
01:51:22.875 --> 01:51:25.458 line:82%
the spirit wanders around.

921
01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:01.083 line:82%
Many times Death touches you,and passes by, and you don't even know it.

922
01:52:01.125 --> 01:52:05.166 line:82%
The tiger does not eat the preylying in front of it.

923
01:52:05.208 --> 01:52:06.500 line:82%
It's not over yet, just hear me out.

924
01:52:06.541 --> 01:52:10.583 line:82%
Since then, the villagers saythat his spirit kills everyone.

925
01:52:10.625 --> 01:52:12.625 line:82%
Just shut up! Give me a break.

926
01:52:12.666 --> 01:52:14.833 line:82%
Stop scaring the girls.

927
01:52:14.875 --> 01:52:16.750 line:82%
Stop scaring us, please.

928
01:52:16.791 --> 01:52:18.833 line:82%
Krish, I don't want to hear any more.

929
01:52:18.875 --> 01:52:23.541 line:82%
Didn't I say you wouldn't believeany of this? You are city folks...

930
01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.583 line:82%
My hunch was right.

931
01:52:31.166 --> 01:52:32.708 line:82%
Kaali...

932
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:36.958 line:82%
Dev, now what?

933
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.291 line:82%
There's no way out
of this situation.

934
01:52:43.166 --> 01:52:48.666 line:82%
We can't kill our enemy.

935
01:52:48.708 --> 01:52:51.833 line:82%
Because he is not alive.

936
01:52:51.875 --> 01:52:57.875 line:82%
The only way out is to escape alive.

937
01:52:59.458 --> 01:53:04.791 line:82%
Fate brought us here,
and only fate can save us.

938
01:53:05.875 --> 01:53:09.625 line:82%
We just have to hold on.

939
01:53:09.666 --> 01:53:12.916 line:82%
It might help us.

940
01:53:35.541 --> 01:53:37.541 line:82%
Ran away.

941
01:53:51.125 --> 01:53:55.250 line:82%
The story was incomplete.
I wish you'd heard it!

942
01:54:05.833 --> 01:54:10.500 line:82%
He was then taken
to the core area. Route 5.

943
01:54:17.375 --> 01:54:20.208 line:82%
They threw him to hungry tigers?

944
01:54:27.291 --> 01:54:32.166 line:82%
A tiger likes the sound of his own breath,
not a human's.

945
01:54:45.166 --> 01:54:49.958 line:82%
He likes the sound of crunching bones,
not your screams.

946
01:54:52.541 --> 01:54:56.208 line:82%
He wants your blood, not you.

947
01:54:57.291 --> 01:54:58.833 line:82%
When his sharp teeth...

948
01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:03.291 line:82%
...sink into your flesh,

949
01:55:04.458 --> 01:55:07.041 line:82%
do you know how it feels?

950
01:55:30.041 --> 01:55:32.833 line:82%
-Dev, the road on the right.
-No.

951
01:55:32.875 --> 01:55:35.333 line:82%
Kaali will be waiting for us there,
like Death.

952
01:55:35.375 --> 01:55:38.291 line:82%
We have to find our own way.
That way.

953
01:55:38.333 --> 01:55:39.416 line:82%
Come on.

954
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.375 line:82%
A tiger tears its prey apart, sir!

955
01:56:09.958 --> 01:56:14.541 line:82%
This jungle is ruled by the tiger!
No one can take its place!

956
01:56:35.916 --> 01:56:40.875 line:82%
It's my jungle!
They are my animals!

957
01:56:56.875 --> 01:56:59.916 line:82%
I hate those who break the laws
of the jungle.

958
01:57:01.416 --> 01:57:02.708 line:82%
Get the car to the guesthouse
after it's fixed.

959
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:04.041 line:82%
Tomorrow I shall take you on route 5.

960
01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:06.041 line:82%
Looks like Kaali's words
have scared you.

961
01:57:08.458 --> 01:57:13.333 line:82%
Every human being who crosses
the limit will learn a lesson.

962
01:57:23.708 --> 01:57:25.125 line:82%
Come on.

963
01:57:25.166 --> 01:57:27.708 line:82%
-Dev, my leg.
-Just a little further.

964
01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:59.000 line:82%
Sit, sit.

965
01:58:01.041 --> 01:58:03.375 line:82%
Come on, come on.

966
01:58:05.458 --> 01:58:07.333 line:82%
-Nothing will happen to you.
-Shit!

967
01:58:07.375 --> 01:58:08.708 line:82%
I won't let anything happen to you.

968
01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:12.125 line:82%
Krish, try the wireless.
Come on, Ishika.

969
01:58:12.166 --> 01:58:14.791 line:82%
It's okay, it's okay.
It's not that bad. Come on.

970
01:58:18.625 --> 01:58:21.000 line:82%
You'll be fine.
Everything will be fine.

971
01:58:34.166 --> 01:58:35.500 line:82%
Watch out!

972
01:59:29.666 --> 01:59:32.416 line:82%
Bagga!

973
01:59:32.458 --> 01:59:34.416 line:82%
Come, sir.

974
01:59:38.291 --> 01:59:40.250 line:82%
Let's go, Bagga.

975
01:59:58.250 --> 02:00:01.791 line:82%
They escaped.

976
02:00:01.833 --> 02:00:03.708 line:82%
But more will come.

977
02:00:05.291 --> 02:00:09.166 line:82%
Orbit Park, research,
man-eater tiger.

978
02:00:18.666 --> 02:00:24.500 line:82%
Dev was right.Staying alive was our victory.

979
02:00:24.541 --> 02:00:28.291 line:82%
We helped our fate and fatehelped us.

980
02:00:29.541 --> 02:00:32.166 line:82%
My research was successful,

981
02:00:32.208 --> 02:00:37.333 line:82%
but I never thought it would beat the cost of losing Riya.

982
02:00:37.375 --> 02:00:42.125 line:82%
And yes, we can never forgetKaali Pratap Singh.

983
02:00:42.166 --> 02:00:45.666 line:82%
Or rather he will neverlet us forget him.

984
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:51.166 line:82%
The newspaperscontinued to spread the same rumors.

985
02:00:51.208 --> 02:00:54.500 line:82%
"Man-eater tiger attacks!"

986
02:00:54.541 --> 02:00:58.125 line:82%
But only we know the truth.

987
02:01:28.666 --> 02:01:31.500 line:82%
I hope we get to hunt
like the last time.

988
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:34.041 line:82%
Find out how long it'll take.

989
02:01:34.083 --> 02:01:36.333 line:82%
-What?
-Just find out what's taking so long.

990
02:01:41.708 --> 02:01:42.958 line:82%
How much longer?

991
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.791 line:82%
There's a river down there.
Go get some water.

992
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.666 line:82%
Listen, be careful.

993
02:01:52.708 --> 02:01:54.000 line:82%
Yeah, man.

994
02:02:02.125 --> 02:02:06.625 line:82%
I asked him to be careful.
But they don't listen to me.

995
02:02:06.666 --> 02:02:08.958 line:82%
My job is to warn them.

996
02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.583 line:82%
Come on, let me escort you
to the gate.

997
02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:33.125 line:82%
Feel the fire, my desire,take me higher, beautiful

998
02:02:33.166 --> 02:02:38.000 line:82%
You´re my pleasure, only treasure you,forever beautiful

999
02:02:38.041 --> 02:02:42.791 line:82%
Come, beloved,my eyes are searching for you

1000
02:02:42.833 --> 02:02:46.791 line:82%
Oh, my, I'm tired waiting for you

1001
02:02:47.791 --> 02:02:52.375 line:82%
I'm yearning every moment,being your devotee

1002
02:02:52.416 --> 02:02:56.916 line:82%
I'll find my world if I find you

1003
02:02:56.958 --> 02:03:02.291 line:82%
You're my passion, you're my vagrancy

1004
02:03:02.333 --> 02:03:06.833 line:82%
Oh, my God, you're my life

My God, I don't like anything anymore

1020
02:04:19.416 --> 02:04:21.750 line:82%
My God, I've lost my senses

1021
02:04:21.791 --> 02:04:23.583 line:82%
My God, there are prayers on my lips

1022
02:04:23.625 --> 02:04:26.416 line:82%
My love is praying for all this

1023
02:04:26.458 --> 02:04:31.083 line:82%
The freshness of a soul,the simplicity of a body

1024
02:04:31.125 --> 02:04:35.666 line:82%
Oh, my God, you're my life
