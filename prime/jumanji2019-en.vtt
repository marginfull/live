Leaving this to come see you.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.577 line:83%
And I can't wait.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.984 line:83%
Taxi! Over here.

4
00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:57.743 line:83%
Taxi!

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:00.329 line:83%
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

6
00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:02.540 line:83%
Excuse me. Excuse me.

7
00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:25.646 line:83%
Gilpin!

8
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.607 line:83%
You still on the toothpaste? Are you on your phone?

9
00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:31.402 line:83%
I'm just-- I'm going home for the holidays tonight, so...

10
00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.530 line:83%
Does it look like tonight to you?
Because to me, it looks like today.

11
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.117 line:83%
-Finish the toothpaste.
-Okay. Sorry.

12
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.814 line:83%
Dad, we're home!

13
00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.483 line:83%
I'm in the kitchen!

14
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:55.277 line:83%
Jan, Spencer!

15
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:56.862 line:83%
In the kitchen!

16
00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:01.575 line:83%
Dad, are you on a ladder?

17
00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:02.952 line:83%
-What are you doing?
-Grandpa.

18
00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:04.495 line:83%
-What's it look like?
-Get down.

19
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:05.913 line:83%
I'm changing your light bulb.

20
00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.123 line:83%
I leave you alone for 10 minutes, you're climbing ladders?

21
00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:11.835 line:83%
-I don't think you should be doing that.
-What? Think I can't change a light bulb?

22
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.295 line:83%
-Okay.
-There.

23
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.883 line:83%
-No, no, no. I got it. I'm fine.
-Okay.

24
00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:20.427 line:83%
Hey, kiddo.

25
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.013 line:83%
Hey, how's New York City?

26
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:25.849 line:83%
-It's great.
-How's school?

27
00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.644 line:83%
It's okay. How you doing?

28
00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:32.856 line:83%
-I'm terrific. I don't even know what I'm doing here.
-You're recovering from hip surgery.

29
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.652 line:83%
-I'll be out of here in no time.
-It's not a prison.

30
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.363 line:83%
I want to get back to my apartment. Is that so terrible?

31
00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.573 line:83%
Your apartment? Yes, it's terrible.

32
00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:43.200 line:83%
Is it really cold in here?

33
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.412 line:83%
Yeah, the downstairs heater isn't working.
The guy's coming in the morning.

34
00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.580 line:83%
It's like a goddamn icebox.

35
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:51.000 line:83%
Did you ever call Milo?

36
00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:52.710 line:83%
-What? No.
-Dad.

37
00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:55.045 line:83%
He's called five times. Would you just call him back?

38
00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.673 line:83%
I'm not calling him back because I don't wanna talk to him.

39
00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.843 line:83%
Come on, I'll help you with your bags.

40
00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:05.556 line:83%
Oh, you're staying in here.

41
00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.057 line:83%
We're roommates.

42
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:10.519 line:83%
Yeah. I could just stay downstairs on the couch.

43
00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.730 line:83%
-What? Don't be ridiculous.
-If you want, yeah.

44
00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:16.567 line:83%
It's a couple weeks. It's gonna be fine.
Come on in. Make yourself comfortable.

45
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:18.902 line:83%
You're gonna...

46
00:05:22.114 --> 00:05:24.158 line:83%
-You okay?
-Don't tell your mother!

47
00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.536 line:83%
This goes there.

48
00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.288 line:83%
There.

49
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.789 line:83%
That's in there.

50
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:36.336 line:83%
All right, let's try it. Okay, let's see. All right, so there's that.

51
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.213 line:83%
There's this. There's this.

52
00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:41.592 line:83%
The blue light, the red, the green light.

53
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.513 line:83%
Oh, look at you two. How sweet is this?

54
00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:49.892 line:83%
Okay, I have to leave for work before either of you gets up.

55
00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.810 line:83%
But the heater guy's coming in the morning.

56
00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:55.939 line:83%
-I think I'm gonna meet my friends for brunch at 10.
-That'll be nice. Where are you going?

57
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.860 line:83%
-Nora's.
-What are you going there for?

58
00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.321 line:83%
All the restaurants in Brantford, you gotta go to that one?

59
00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:04.323 line:83%
-I didn't pick.
-What difference does it make?

60
00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.033 line:83%
It's been years, okay?

61
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:09.495 line:83%
-I love you, honey. I'm so glad you're home.
-Love you too, Mom.

62
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.712 line:83%
Getting old sucks. Don't let anybody tell you any different.

63
00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:21.965 line:83%
You still got that little girlfriend?

64
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.634 line:83%
No.

65
00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:26.678 line:83%
We're not together anymore.

66
00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:27.971 line:83%
I don't think.

67
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:29.932 line:83%
Was it her or you?

68
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.561 line:83%
-It's complicated.
-Try me. We'll see if I can understand.

69
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:38.774 line:83%
Well, when we first got together,

70
00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:41.151 line:83%
we were...

71
00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:46.824 line:83%
sort of different people than we are now.

72
00:06:48.117 --> 00:06:50.702 line:83%
I mean, last year was...

73
00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:52.579 line:83%
amazing.

74
00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:54.581 line:83%
I was a senior in high school.

75
00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:56.291 line:83%
I had a girlfriend.

76
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.796 line:83%
Like, I finally figured out who I was or something.

77
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.342 line:83%
I wish I could just feel like that again, I guess.

78
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.516 line:83%
I don't know. Long-distance relationships are hard.

79
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:16.145 line:83%
I mean, I know everybody says that, but turns out it's true.

80
00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:20.899 line:83%
Can I give you a little advice? Listen to me.

81
00:07:20.983 --> 00:07:26.822 line:83%
Every single day on every single subway car,
there's lots of ladies in New York City.

82
00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:31.577 line:83%
And one in five of them, I would marry, no questions asked.

83
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.871 line:83%
This is the best time of your life.

84
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.832 line:83%
-It is?
-Yes, it is.

85
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:39.918 line:83%
So pull it together! Because it doesn't get any better than this.

86
00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:42.296 line:83%
It's all downhill from here.

87
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.014 line:83%
Bravestone.

88
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.239 line:83%
-Hi!
-Hi!

89
00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:35.200 line:83%
-Hey.
-Oh, gosh, how are you?

90
00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:38.161 line:83%
-Oh, my God, you look amazing.
-Thank you.

91
00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:41.415 line:83%
-Fridge.
-Fridge!

92
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.916 line:83%
Come here.

93
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.502 line:83%
So we were building houses for two months,

94
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:50.549 line:83%
and then on the way home,
we stopped in Costa Rica, which was also amazing.

95
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.926 line:83%
That is so awesome. I am so happy for you.

96
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.136 line:83%
That is so cool.

97
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:57.764 line:83%
So, "M," that's what we're supposed to call you now?

98
00:09:57.848 --> 00:10:01.852 line:83%
You don't have to. It's just a nickname.
One of my college friends gave me that.

99
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.271 line:83%
You don't have to call me that if you don't want to.

100
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.440 line:83%
M. I love it. It's so hot.

101
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.485 line:83%
-Okay.
-But you and Spencer, you're still not...?

102
00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:14.114 line:83%
Yeah. No. We're-- We're still, like, taking a break.

103
00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:18.285 line:83%
Where is he, by the way?

104
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.181 line:83%
Christ.

105
00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.600 line:83%
What do you want, Milo?

106
00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.435 line:83%
Nice to see you too.

107
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.191 line:83%
Yes, I'd love to come in for a cup of coffee.

108
00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.817 line:83%
Thanks for asking.

109
00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.116 line:83%
You mind if I make some eggs?

110
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.870 line:83%
Do whatever you want. I don't care.
Just hurry up. I don't have all day.

111
00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.246 line:83%
You going somewhere?

112
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.001 line:83%
Have...?

113
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:12.464 line:83%
Have you been in touch with Spencer much?

114
00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:13.465 line:83%
Yeah...

115
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.510 line:83%
You know what?

116
00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.012 line:83%
Not really, actually.

117
00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:22.599 line:83%
I text him a lot, but he doesn't always text me back.

118
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:23.809 line:83%
-I know.
-It's just--

119
00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:27.813 line:83%
I've been crazed lately with, you know, classes and practices,

120
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.523 line:83%
and I got games on the weekends.

121
00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.316 line:83%
Yeah. Totally. Totally.

122
00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:36.613 line:83%
I've just-- I've been-- I've been a little worried about him.

123
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:43.203 line:83%
Okay, look, where--? Where is this guy? For real.

124
00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:47.999 line:83%
Good?

125
00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.670 line:83%
What do you mean, "Meh"?

126
00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:54.464 line:83%
What do you want already?

127
00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:58.385 line:83%
You've been calling and calling.
You show up out of the blue after 15 years.

128
00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:01.179 line:83%
Why? Because you wanna make some eggs?

129
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.186 line:83%
You remember when we first opened,

130
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.440 line:83%
we had that little dishwasher, Morris?

131
00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:13.859 line:83%
Yeah, of course I remember Morris.

132
00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.902 line:83%
Worked the dinner shift.

133
00:12:15.986 --> 00:12:18.822 line:83%
Six days a week, 2 in the morning most nights.

134
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.159 line:83%
-The dishwasher.
-Little Morris.

135
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.746 line:83%
He wouldn't even touch those saucepans until he was done

136
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.042 line:83%
with every single utensil in the bin.

137
00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.504 line:83%
The man knew his craft.

138
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:36.965 line:83%
Little Morris.

139
00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:42.220 line:83%
Well, get--

140
00:12:42.304 --> 00:12:46.766 line:83%
Just get to it, would you?
I mean, it's always the scenic route with you.

141
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.603 line:83%
I know what you want, you want to apologize.

142
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:52.939 line:83%
And I hate to tell you, I'm not interested.

143
00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:55.817 line:83%
You think I'm supposed to apologize to you?

144
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.903 line:83%
Oh, heater guy.

145
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.949 line:83%
-Grandpa Eddie?
-Anthony?

146
00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.159 line:83%
Yes, sir, it's me.

147
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.994 line:83%
Anthony!

148
00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.287 line:83%
How are you?

149
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.164 line:83%
Come on in. Come on in.

150
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.794 line:83%
-How you doing?
-Oh, getting old sucks.

151
00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:17.506 line:83%
Don't ever let anybody tell you any different.

152
00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:21.593 line:83%
Oh, this is Martha and Bethany.
This is Spencer's grandfather, Eddie.

153
00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.470 line:83%
Martha? You're the little girlfriend.

154
00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:26.765 line:83%
-Morning!
-Morning, sir.

155
00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.475 line:83%
Sorry to barge in on you.

156
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.852 line:83%
You're not barging. He's barging.

157
00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:32.062 line:83%
Milo Walker.

158
00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:36.900 line:83%
-Wait, Milo? Like-- Like Milo and Eddie's.
-Pleased to meet you.

159
00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.611 line:83%
Man, my dad said you guys had the best restaurant in town.

160
00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.405 line:83%
We were just there. Well, it's called Nora's now.

161
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:47.827 line:83%
Nora's. It's barely even a restaurant.
It's more like a breakfast place now.

162
00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:54.084 line:83%
-Were you with Spencer?
-No, we came here looking for him, actually.

163
00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.252 line:83%
You all hungry?

164
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.420 line:83%
-Eggs on the griddle.
-Might have to take a look.

165
00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:02.217 line:83%
-Hey, man, you can do more than take a look at it.
-All right, all right. My man.

166
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:09.099 line:83%
-Do you need a hand?
-Do I look like I need a hand?

167
00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:15.897 line:83%
Martha?

168
00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:20.902 line:83%
Hey.

169
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:23.863 line:83%
Where is he?

170
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.543 line:83%
-Do you hear that?
-Yes.

171
00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.009 line:83%
You hear something?

172
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.344 line:83%
It's probably the heater, it's broken.

173
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:52.976 line:83%
How did it even get here?

174
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.811 line:83%
I don't know.

175
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.690 line:83%
Maybe he-- I don't know,
maybe he went back for it or something?

176
00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:03.069 line:83%
Is he trying to fix it?

177
00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:05.739 line:83%
Why would anyone try to fix that thing?

178
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.490 line:83%
I don't know.

179
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.660 line:83%
I don't know. Maybe he went to buy parts or something?

180
00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.662 line:83%
Okay, I'm calling him again.

181
00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.790 line:83%
I'm sure everything's... fine.

182
00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.187 line:83%
Fourteen texts and four missed calls.

183
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:42.025 line:83%
I don't think he went out.

184
00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:44.944 line:83%
I think...

185
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:47.989 line:83%
I think he went back in.

186
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:53.078 line:83%
-No, no, no.
-What? No. Why--?

187
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.664 line:83%
-Come on. Remember what it was like?
-Why would he do that?

188
00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.792 line:83%
-I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
-I got killed by a piece of cake!

189
00:15:58.875 --> 00:15:59.793 line:83%
Guys, guys.

190
00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.295 line:83%
How is he gonna get out?

191
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.175 line:83%
He's gotta take the-- The green jewel.

192
00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.678 line:83%
And stick it back in the statue thing.

193
00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:10.929 line:83%
By himself?

194
00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:27.612 line:83%
We gotta go get him.

195
00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.155 line:83%
Are you crazy?

196
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.449 line:83%
-I'm coming with you.
-Are you out of your minds?

197
00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:34.327 line:83%
We can do this. We've been there. We know what to expect.

198
00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:37.789 line:83%
I gotta stop hanging out with white people.
I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.

199
00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:42.043 line:83%
-She's right. We played before and we won.
-We barely survived!

200
00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.628 line:83%
You know he would do it for you.

201
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.005 line:83%
For any of us.

202
00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.849 line:83%
Be careful. It looks pretty busted.

203
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:03.148 line:83%
Welcome to Jumanji.

204
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.693 line:83%
What...? We haven't even picked our guys yet!

205
00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:08.528 line:83%
What?

206
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:13.450 line:83%
Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I hate this part. All right. Okay.

207
00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.413 line:83%
This is not happening!

208
00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.088 line:83%
You guys?

209
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:32.427 line:83%
No!

210
00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:52.322 line:83%
Am I--?

211
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.158 line:83%
Is it--? I can't believe--

212
00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.415 line:83%
Oh, it's her.

213
00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:03.500 line:83%
I'm her.

214
00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.133 line:83%
Spencer.

215
00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:14.469 line:83%
Spencer?

216
00:18:18.681 --> 00:18:21.601 line:83%
What in tarnation?

217
00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.102 line:83%
Where am I?

218
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.814 line:83%
What the hell is this?

219
00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:29.317 line:83%
Oh, my God.

220
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.485 line:83%
Eddie?

221
00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:35.990 line:83%
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?

222
00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:37.617 line:83%
Milo?

223
00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.411 line:83%
What on earth? What--?

224
00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:41.788 line:83%
-What the--?
-Oh, my.

225
00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:42.997 line:83%
Wait a minute.

226
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.582 line:83%
Oh, Lord.

227
00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:47.001 line:83%
-This isn't happening.
-Pardon me?

228
00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:50.213 line:83%
-Who are you?
-You're Spencer's grandfather.

229
00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.466 line:83%
-Yeah, no kidding.
-And you are Milo.

230
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.968 line:83%
I certainly am.

231
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.262 line:83%
I'm Martha, Spencer's...

232
00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.888 line:83%
You're the little girlfriend?

233
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.099 line:83%
-Look out!
-What?

234
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.395 line:83%
Oh, Lord.

235
00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:09.148 line:83%
-That hurt like a goddamn--
-Bethany?

236
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.442 line:83%
What? I'm not--

237
00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.319 line:83%
No.

238
00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:17.866 line:83%
No, no, no.

239
00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.117 line:83%
Yo!

240
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.080 line:83%
Oh, no, no, no. This can't be happening!

241
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.123 line:83%
Fridge?

242
00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:28.751 line:83%
Yes, I'm Fridge, goddamn it! The hell, man?

243
00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:30.295 line:83%
Okay.

244
00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.714 line:83%
Okay, something went wrong.

245
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:33.715 line:83%
You think?!

246
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.137 line:83%
Holy...

247
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.054 line:83%
Wait.

248
00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.599 line:83%
If I'm-- Then you--?

249
00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.894 line:83%
-Spencer?
-Why does everybody keep calling me Spencer?

250
00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:47.729 line:83%
No, that is Grandpa Eddie.

251
00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:50.565 line:83%
And that... is Milo.

252
00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.108 line:83%
Pleased to meet you.

253
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.234 line:83%
What?!

254
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.572 line:83%
-Then where's Bethany? And where's Spencer?
-I don't know! Okay?

255
00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.949 line:83%
The game, it didn't let us pick our avatars, so--

256
00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:01.910 line:83%
-Because it's busted!
-Yeah, okay.

257
00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:03.328 line:83%
Are we dead?

258
00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:06.164 line:83%
You know, I was just wondering the same thing.

259
00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:11.085 line:83%
Did I die and turn into some kind
of a small, muscular Boy Scout?

260
00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:14.172 line:83%
-We're not dead.
-So then what's going on here?

261
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:20.053 line:83%
Okay, this is gonna sound very strange,
but we are in a video game called
Jumanji,

262
00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:24.766 line:83%
and we are in the bodies of video game characters.

263
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.685 line:83%
-And we've been here before, Fridge and I.
-Last time, I was you.

264
00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:31.314 line:83%
We're in a game!

265
00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.566 line:83%
We gotta find Spencer because he's in here too.

266
00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:35.777 line:83%
-Spencer?
-Yes.

267
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.654 line:83%
-He's here?
-Yes.

268
00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.364 line:83%
Spencer, Eddie's grandson?

269
00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.282 line:83%
Yes. Spencer.

270
00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:42.867 line:83%
He's here too?

271
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.286 line:83%
-Yes!
-Yes! He's here, and we gotta find him.

272
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.789 line:83%
So it's like a hide-and-go-seek situation.

273
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.916 line:83%
I'm not "it."

274
00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:56.714 line:83%
My hip feels pretty good now.

275
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.803 line:83%
Oh, my joints feel like butter.

276
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.723 line:83%
Oh, yeah, look at those.

277
00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:08.434 line:83%
Look at these. Look at what I got.

278
00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.605 line:83%
-We have some issues here.
-You're telling me this?

279
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:14.399 line:83%
I'm the old fat dude.

280
00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:18.611 line:83%
I came back, and things actually got worse.
At least last time I was still black.

281
00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:23.157 line:83%
Look at this little fella.

282
00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.369 line:83%
Hello there.

283
00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:28.705 line:83%
Mr. Walker, don't get too close to the water!

284
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.999 line:83%
-Get away from there!
-I'm sorry, what'd you say?

285
00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:37.005 line:83%
Hey!

286
00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:41.175 line:83%
Get on out of here!

287
00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:45.179 line:83%
-What just happened?
-What the hell was that thing?!

288
00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:53.771 line:83%
Well, that there was a hippopotamus.

289
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.275 line:83%
And they are awfully fast.

290
00:21:57.358 --> 00:22:00.111 line:83%
Faster than a horse, if you can believe that.

291
00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:03.740 line:83%
And they've got an awful ferocious bite.

292
00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.199 line:83%
How about that?

293
00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:08.786 line:83%
You know, the funny thing is, I don't remember...

294
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.373 line:83%
knowing much about hippos until right now.

295
00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:13.916 line:83%
You're a zoologist.

296
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.753 line:83%
-I'm sorry, what now?
-Are we in Florida?

297
00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:19.005 line:83%
Just listen.

298
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:21.591 line:83%
This is a dangerous place.

299
00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:22.967 line:83%
Crazy dangerous.

300
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:26.137 line:83%
But Martha and I, we've been here before.
We know what we're doing.

301
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.432 line:83%
You gotta stay alert all the time.

302
00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:33.519 line:83%
If I'm near water, I got one eye on the water, you hear me?

303
00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:36.105 line:83%
You got to have eyes in the back of your--

304
00:22:40.651 --> 00:22:42.528 line:83%
Oh, God.

305
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:46.741 line:83%
What in the Sam Hill just happened to him?

306
00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:55.666 line:83%
-Shut the front door.
-What the hell happened to you?!

307
00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:58.961 line:83%
Damn!

308
00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:03.049 line:83%
A plane?

309
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.051 line:83%
What?

310
00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:08.846 line:83%
-Come on! Follow me!
-Come on, let's go. Let's go. Follow us.

311
00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:19.440 line:83%
Welcome to Jumanji.

312
00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:21.692 line:83%
-Why is he in a plane?
-I don't know.

313
00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:23.861 line:83%
Well, don't just stand there. Hop in!

314
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:30.868 line:83%
Strap in. There's no time to spare.

315
00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:39.127 line:83%
Dr. Bravestone, famed archeologist
and international explorer,

316
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.878 line:83%
I'm so glad you've returned.

317
00:23:40.962 --> 00:23:43.047 line:83%
I've been so anxious for your arrival.

318
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:45.216 line:83%
-You talking to me?
-Yes.

319
00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:48.845 line:83%
Once again, Jumanji is in great peril and only you can help.

320
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:51.889 line:83%
Nigel, we're looking for our friend.
Have you seen, like, anyone--?

321
00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:55.184 line:83%
Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men, welcome to Jumanji.

322
00:23:55.726 --> 00:23:59.438 line:83%
-"Killer of men"?
-Yeah, I-- I kill guys.

323
00:23:59.522 --> 00:24:03.568 line:83%
I'm so glad you've returned.
I've been so anxious for your arrival.

324
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:07.572 line:83%
-What's with this fella?
-My dearest Mouse, surely you remember me.

325
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.365 line:83%
Nigel Billingsly at your service.

326
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:11.951 line:83%
Hey. Nigel, I thought that was you.

327
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.620 line:83%
He's a-- What is it called?

328
00:24:14.704 --> 00:24:17.999 line:83%
-NPC, a non-player character.
-He's not a real person.

329
00:24:18.082 --> 00:24:20.751 line:83%
He only has, like, a limited number of things he can say.

330
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:23.504 line:83%
My friend Carl is just like that.

331
00:24:23.588 --> 00:24:25.214 line:83%
Nigel, we're looking for someone.

332
00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:28.509 line:83%
-Has anyone else arrived here in Jumanji--?
-Jumanji is in great peril.

333
00:24:28.593 --> 00:24:31.262 line:83%
It's all detailed in the letter I sent you, Dr. Bravestone.

334
00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:32.930 line:83%
Perhaps you should read it aloud.

335
00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:34.432 line:83%
Grandpa Eddie.

336
00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:36.517 line:83%
Do you have a letter?

337
00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:38.769 line:83%
-Do I have a letter?
-Check your pockets.

338
00:24:38.853 --> 00:24:41.731 line:83%
-Why would I have a letter?
-Because Nigel wrote you a letter.

339
00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:43.399 line:83%
I didn't get a letter from this guy.

340
00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:47.403 line:83%
-But we are in a video game, and--
-We're in a video game?

341
00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:48.571 line:83%
We're gonna die.

342
00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:50.615 line:83%
-We did die.
-Are we in hell?

343
00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:52.116 line:83%
-I knew it.
-Oh, my God.

344
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.702 line:83%
It's all detailed in the letter I sent you, Dr. Bravestone.

345
00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:57.205 line:83%
-Perhaps you should read it aloud.
-I don't have a letter!

346
00:24:57.288 --> 00:25:01.626 line:83%
-How many times I gotta tell you that?
-Oh, no, Eddie. It's in your hand.

347
00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:04.754 line:83%
Where did this come from?

348
00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:07.965 line:83%
You got to pay attention to what's in your hand.

349
00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:09.550 line:83%
Perhaps you should read it aloud.

350
00:25:12.887 --> 00:25:14.222 line:83%
"Dr. Bravestone,

351
00:25:14.305 --> 00:25:19.101 line:83%
it is my solemn hope that this letter finds you, for again..."

352
00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:23.564 line:83%
Jumanji is in grave danger. We need your help at once.

353
00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:25.816 line:83%
-What's going on here?
-It's a cutscene.

354
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.444 line:83%
It's how we find out the-- I'll explain afterwards.

355
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:31.739 line:83%
You see, our worst nightmare has come to pass,

356
00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:34.951 line:83%
for Jurgen the Brutal has returned.

357
00:25:35.034 --> 00:25:38.287 line:83%
Indeed, that most vicious Jumanjian conqueror is back.

358
00:25:39.163 --> 00:25:41.749 line:83%
And he's brought with him his savage horde.

359
00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:46.420 line:83%
They descended from their fortress atop Mount Zhatmire

360
00:25:46.504 --> 00:25:49.423 line:83%
and made their way south to the Avian Province,

361
00:25:50.633 --> 00:25:53.302 line:83%
home of the sacred Falcon Jewel,

362
00:25:53.386 --> 00:25:55.680 line:83%
worn around the neck of the village elder.

363
00:25:55.763 --> 00:25:58.182 line:83%
The Falcon is the fertility jewel of Jumanji,

364
00:25:58.266 --> 00:26:02.895 line:83%
and it has been guarded by the people
of the Avian Province for hundreds of years.

365
00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:05.189 line:83%
So long as the jewel can see the sun,

366
00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:08.442 line:83%
the waters will flow and the land will flourish.

367
00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:16.993 line:83%
Yeah!

368
00:26:25.543 --> 00:26:31.048 line:83%
Many brave souls died that day,
but Jurgen got what he came for.

369
00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:33.467 line:83%
He stowed the jewel in darkness,

370
00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:35.052 line:83%
hidden from the sun.

371
00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:48.816 line:83%
A drought befell the land.

372
00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:51.027 line:83%
The crops dried out and died.

373
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.572 line:83%
And if the jewel is not returned soon, it may be too late.

374
00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:58.743 line:83%
Which is why we called for you and your brilliant associates.

375
00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:02.872 line:83%
I understand the enormous weight
that this must carry for you, Dr. Bravestone,

376
00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:04.999 line:83%
how this adventure is like no other,

377
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.169 line:83%
since it was Jurgen the Brutal

378
00:27:08.252 --> 00:27:10.254 line:83%
who killed your parents.

379
00:27:13.674 --> 00:27:15.259 line:83%
No, no, no!

380
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:20.306 line:83%
He killed Dr. Bravestone's parents?

381
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:22.725 line:83%
Indeed, he did. When the doctor was just a boy.

382
00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:24.810 line:83%
Oh, well, that's terrible.

383
00:27:24.894 --> 00:27:26.354 line:83%
I can't say this enough:

384
00:27:26.437 --> 00:27:27.855 line:83%
We're in a video game.

385
00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:32.151 line:83%
You must recover the jewel
from Jurgen the Brutal and show it to the sun.

386
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:35.029 line:83%
He's making his way north across the desert now.

387
00:27:35.112 --> 00:27:37.990 line:83%
Jurgen the Brutal. Is that Barbara's boy?

388
00:27:38.074 --> 00:27:40.368 line:83%
And remember, the goal is to recover the loot.

389
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:42.370 line:83%
To wrest it from the hands of the Brute.

390
00:27:42.453 --> 00:27:46.457 line:83%
And if you wish to leave the game,
you must save Jumanji and call out its name.

391
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.625 line:83%
Excuse me.

392
00:27:48.042 --> 00:27:49.960 line:83%
Who is Jumanji?

393
00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:53.506 line:83%
Well, if I was listening correctly, that is her sister.

394
00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:54.590 line:83%
Here's your map.

395
00:27:56.717 --> 00:28:00.096 line:83%
Find an oasis and follow the flame to the desert fruit.

396
00:28:00.763 --> 00:28:04.100 line:83%
-I can't land here, so you're going to have to drop in.
-What?

397
00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:05.976 line:83%
-No, no. Nigel--
-I'll get as low as I can.

398
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.103 line:83%
-Hold on.
-Get ready.

399
00:28:07.186 --> 00:28:10.189 line:83%
-What do you mean?
-We don't have parachutes. Shouldn't we have--?

400
00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:12.024 line:83%
-What the hell?!
-Good luck.

401
00:28:12.108 --> 00:28:14.193 line:83%
The future of Jumanji is in your hands.

402
00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:17.405 line:83%
-Why did we take a plane if there's nowhere to land?
-And go!

403
00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:47.309 line:83%
The hell, man?!

404
00:28:58.487 --> 00:28:59.613 line:83%
Where are we?

405
00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:01.365 line:83%
Where's the jungle?

406
00:29:01.824 --> 00:29:05.286 line:83%
-What are we doing here?!
-We've got to keep it together, okay?

407
00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:06.871 line:83%
-"Keep it together"?
-Yes.

408
00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:10.499 line:83%
This is a whole new thing.
Nobody said we'd have to do a whole new thing.

409
00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:13.461 line:83%
And by the way, what the hell happened to Bethany?

410
00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:36.609 line:83%
So, what part of New Hampshire is this exactly?

411
00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:38.652 line:83%
We're not in New Hampshire, Milo.

412
00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:41.864 line:83%
That's right. Exactly. Not New Hampshire.
You're starting to get it now?

413
00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:45.284 line:83%
Nope. I don't have the foggiest clue what's going on here.

414
00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:49.163 line:83%
That guy kept calling me Dr. Braverman,
which is the name of my orthopedist.

415
00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:52.708 line:83%
What I'm thinking is, I just had another hip surgery
and now I'm coming out of it.

416
00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:54.126 line:83%
Hey!

417
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.128 line:83%
Check this out!

418
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.927 line:83%
Okay.

419
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.553 line:83%
We have to find Spencer.

420
00:30:04.637 --> 00:30:07.348 line:83%
In order to do that, I think we have to start playing the game.

421
00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:08.641 line:83%
I'm sure that's what he did.

422
00:30:08.724 --> 00:30:12.937 line:83%
We find him, we finish the game and we go home.

423
00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:15.481 line:83%
Ed, you okay?

424
00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:17.191 line:83%
Would you look at me?

425
00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:19.735 line:83%
I'm back.

426
00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:23.822 line:83%
-I mean, I haven't looked like this since--
-Never.

427
00:30:23.906 --> 00:30:26.033 line:83%
You looked like this never.

428
00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:28.410 line:83%
What? When I was younger, I was in great shape.

429
00:30:28.494 --> 00:30:33.707 line:83%
I remember you when you were younger,
and this is not what you looked like.

430
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:35.876 line:83%
I think my eyes are a different color.

431
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.837 line:83%
All of you is a different color.

432
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:40.631 line:83%
It's a good look on me, huh?

433
00:30:42.258 --> 00:30:44.593 line:83%
Okay. They're headed north.

434
00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:46.971 line:83%
-Which way is north?
-I have no idea.

435
00:30:47.054 --> 00:30:50.724 line:83%
-Well, you wanna check the map?
-Right. I'm the map guy now.

436
00:30:50.808 --> 00:30:54.812 line:83%
"Find an oasis and follow the flame to the desert fruit."

437
00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:57.731 line:83%
Follow the flame to the desert fruit.

438
00:30:57.815 --> 00:31:00.734 line:83%
-You know there is nothing on that?
-He can see it, you can't.

439
00:31:00.818 --> 00:31:04.154 line:83%
Each place on the map is a different level,
and the levels get harder as we go.

440
00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:07.283 line:83%
This one is called...

441
00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:09.451 line:83%
"Dunes."

442
00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:11.203 line:83%
No shit.

443
00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:14.999 line:83%
Who the hell is that?

444
00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:22.840 line:83%
That's an ostrich.

445
00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:23.799 line:83%
Oh, no.

446
00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:26.802 line:83%
Yes, indeed.

447
00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:30.556 line:83%
That is an ostrich.

448
00:31:30.639 --> 00:31:33.642 line:83%
The ostrich is a flightless bird,

449
00:31:33.726 --> 00:31:36.020 line:83%
one of 60 species.

450
00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:40.816 line:83%
You got the penguin, you got the emu and you got the kiwi.

451
00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:43.110 line:83%
Funny thing is, I don't remember knowing--

452
00:31:43.193 --> 00:31:44.403 line:83%
You're a zoologist.

453
00:31:44.486 --> 00:31:46.905 line:83%
I was a zoologist last time. It's an important job.

454
00:31:46.989 --> 00:31:49.241 line:83%
Maybe if we could get through this a little quicker.

455
00:31:49.325 --> 00:31:54.288 line:83%
Well, another thing is,
they can run up to 45 miles per hour,

456
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:58.042 line:83%
which makes them the world's fastest two-legged animal.

457
00:31:58.125 --> 00:31:59.585 line:83%
Did you know that?

458
00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:01.128 line:83%
Fascinating.

459
00:32:02.588 --> 00:32:06.175 line:83%
-What a magnificent creature.
-We should get out of here.

460
00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:09.428 line:83%
What else do you know about them?

461
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:13.891 line:83%
Well, here's another interesting fact,
they have three stomachs.

462
00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:15.142 line:83%
How about that?

463
00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:19.688 line:83%
Come on. Beat it!

464
00:32:19.772 --> 00:32:21.440 line:83%
Don't get so close.

465
00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:24.860 line:83%
Just a bird, okay? Come on, get moving. Get out of here.

466
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:27.279 line:83%
-Is there anything else we need to know?
-Beat it, bird.

467
00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:29.698 line:83%
Another interesting thing about the ostrich...

468
00:32:29.782 --> 00:32:31.784 line:83%
I said scram, you stupid bird!

469
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:33.952 line:83%
-...is when threatened...
-Get out of here!

470
00:32:34.036 --> 00:32:35.120 line:83%
...they attack.

471
00:32:38.123 --> 00:32:39.500 line:83%
Oh, my!

472
00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:43.671 line:83%
Eddie! Eddie!

473
00:32:44.171 --> 00:32:46.298 line:83%
Where's Eddie? Is he dead?

474
00:32:46.382 --> 00:32:47.257 line:83%
-No!
-Yes.

475
00:32:47.341 --> 00:32:49.009 line:83%
Yes, he died, but he's fine.

476
00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:52.888 line:83%
Did I just kill Eddie...

477
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.640 line:83%
by talking too slow...

478
00:32:56.392 --> 00:32:57.935 line:83%
like he always said I would?

479
00:33:09.113 --> 00:33:11.990 line:83%
Why does everybody keep dropping from the sky?!

480
00:33:13.117 --> 00:33:16.912 line:83%
Nurse, I'm gonna need
to see Dr. Braverman right now, please.

481
00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:19.957 line:83%
I'm not your nurse. Okay, listen.

482
00:33:20.374 --> 00:33:23.877 line:83%
These tattoos on our arms, that is your life count.

483
00:33:24.378 --> 00:33:25.754 line:83%
We each have three lives.

484
00:33:25.838 --> 00:33:28.340 line:83%
You and Fridge each have two left.

485
00:33:28.424 --> 00:33:30.008 line:83%
If you lose all three,

486
00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:32.803 line:83%
listen to me, it is game over.

487
00:33:32.886 --> 00:33:37.015 line:83%
-That's it. You're dead.
-Dead like... "kaputski"?

488
00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:38.475 line:83%
Yes.

489
00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:39.768 line:83%
Kaputski.

490
00:33:44.982 --> 00:33:46.150 line:83%
What the hell is that?

491
00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:47.818 line:83%
-That's not good.
-Look.

492
00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:59.997 line:83%
There's one more thing about ostriches.

493
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.081 line:83%
Oh, no.

494
00:34:01.165 --> 00:34:02.291 line:83%
Say it!

495
00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:04.710 line:83%
They travel in herds.

496
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:11.341 line:83%
We gotta get out of here!

497
00:34:11.425 --> 00:34:14.136 line:83%
-Dune buggies, let's go!
-Come on, come on! Shake a leg!

498
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:17.097 line:83%
-Why am I so slow?
-Haul ass, girl. Let's go!

499
00:34:17.181 --> 00:34:19.433 line:83%
-Come on, come on, come on!
-I'm coming, Eddie. Go.

500
00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:20.851 line:83%
Do you see the key anywhere?

501
00:34:20.934 --> 00:34:23.645 line:83%
-Okay, how do I do this?
-I don't know. I've never driven one of these before!

502
00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:29.485 line:83%
Maybe under the dash.

503
00:34:30.611 --> 00:34:31.612 line:83%
Green button!

504
00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:32.738 line:83%
Green button. Go.

505
00:34:32.821 --> 00:34:34.114 line:83%
Go, go, go!

506
00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:37.534 line:83%
Go, go.

507
00:34:46.919 --> 00:34:48.045 line:83%
Oh, my God!

508
00:35:01.058 --> 00:35:01.892 line:83%
Go.

509
00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:04.937 line:83%
You are a terrible driver.

510
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.106 line:83%
-What are you talking about? We're fine.
-Nobody fine. You--

511
00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:11.443 line:83%
Oh, no.

512
00:35:12.653 --> 00:35:13.987 line:83%
Oh, help!

513
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.990 line:83%
Hold on, Eddie. Please don't let go.

514
00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:21.161 line:83%
Oh, help.

515
00:35:27.918 --> 00:35:29.294 line:83%
Help. Eddie.

516
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.008 line:83%
Beat it!

517
00:35:36.218 --> 00:35:37.469 line:83%
Get out of here!

518
00:35:41.807 --> 00:35:42.766 line:83%
I think we lost them.

519
00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:43.892 line:83%
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

520
00:36:00.033 --> 00:36:01.785 line:83%
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

521
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:05.914 line:83%
Oh, no.

522
00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:13.338 line:83%
-What do we do?
-I don't know!

523
00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:19.553 line:83%
Get in! Hurry!

524
00:36:30.981 --> 00:36:32.065 line:83%
Suckers!

525
00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.490 line:83%
Eddie...

526
00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:49.207 line:83%
Oh, dear.

527
00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:52.544 line:83%
What do we do?

528
00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:54.922 line:83%
What do we do?!

529
00:36:59.301 --> 00:37:00.510 line:83%
What are you doing?

530
00:37:00.594 --> 00:37:03.931 line:83%
-Birds, birds, birds!
-Birds!

531
00:37:11.313 --> 00:37:14.441 line:83%
-What the hell, man?!
-They're flightless birds.

532
00:37:14.524 --> 00:37:16.818 line:83%
This is a flightless dune buggy!

533
00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.863 line:83%
Oh, no!

534
00:37:22.908 --> 00:37:23.992 line:83%
No, no, no!

535
00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:26.912 line:83%
-We're not gonna make it.
-We're gonna make it.

536
00:37:26.995 --> 00:37:28.121 line:83%
No, we're not!

537
00:37:28.205 --> 00:37:30.415 line:83%
-I don't think we're gonna make it.
-We're gonna make it.

538
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.340 line:83%
We're not gonna make it.

539
00:37:48.934 --> 00:37:51.728 line:83%
That was fantastic.

540
00:37:53.522 --> 00:37:54.856 line:83%
Horrible driver.

541
00:37:56.316 --> 00:37:57.859 line:83%
Yeah, you see that, birds?

542
00:37:57.943 --> 00:38:01.029 line:83%
You don't mess with the kid. Right there!

543
00:38:05.117 --> 00:38:06.118 line:83%
Did you see me?

544
00:38:06.994 --> 00:38:08.120 line:83%
I was incredible.

545
00:38:08.537 --> 00:38:11.039 line:83%
I mean, I saved you, I saved you,

546
00:38:11.123 --> 00:38:15.585 line:83%
I saved this guy from a bird while I was driving a car.

547
00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:18.046 line:83%
I was a machine. I was relentless.

548
00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:21.925 line:83%
-I was fearless.
-Yes. Exactly. Fearless.

549
00:38:22.009 --> 00:38:25.262 line:83%
That's Bravestone. Okay, check this out.

550
00:38:27.264 --> 00:38:28.724 line:83%
Oh, goodness.

551
00:38:30.517 --> 00:38:32.894 line:83%
-What the hell?
-It's your strengths and weaknesses.

552
00:38:32.978 --> 00:38:37.649 line:83%
I-- I mean your avatar,
Dr. Bravestone's strengths and weaknesses.

553
00:38:37.733 --> 00:38:39.526 line:83%
"Fearless," check.

554
00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:42.070 line:83%
"Speed. Climbing. Boomerang"?

555
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.032 line:83%
"Smoldering intensity"?

556
00:38:45.115 --> 00:38:47.325 line:83%
It's this stupid face you make.

557
00:38:51.455 --> 00:38:52.622 line:83%
There it is.

558
00:38:54.708 --> 00:38:56.793 line:83%
Old man. Get it together.

559
00:38:56.877 --> 00:38:59.379 line:83%
Eddie, you okay? You having a heart attack?

560
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.799 line:83%
His whole left side is shutting down. Eddie, look at me!

561
00:39:02.883 --> 00:39:05.510 line:83%
-Yeah?
-There you go. Now you're back.

562
00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.056 line:83%
"Weakness: switchblade."

563
00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:11.558 line:83%
Switchblade? Hey, that's new.

564
00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:14.770 line:83%
-Bravestone didn't have any weaknesses last time.
-Yeah, bugged the hell out of me.

565
00:39:15.562 --> 00:39:16.688 line:83%
I wonder if...

566
00:39:22.027 --> 00:39:23.612 line:83%
"Nunchucks"?

567
00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:24.529 line:83%
That's new.

568
00:39:24.613 --> 00:39:27.908 line:83%
-Damn, that's a good list.
-Milo, push on your left, like, chest area.

569
00:39:28.825 --> 00:39:30.869 line:83%
-I'm sorry, what?
-Come on, man.

570
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.163 line:83%
Hey!

571
00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:35.373 line:83%
Oh, I got one too. What--?

572
00:39:35.457 --> 00:39:37.834 line:83%
My. "Zoology."

573
00:39:38.877 --> 00:39:42.964 line:83%
-That's what you were talking about earlier.
-Yes. Exactly. Your avatar is a zoologist.

574
00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:48.136 line:83%
You know, my nephew Maxwell is a veterinarian.
What a fascinating--

575
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.514 line:83%
-"Linguistics"?
-I didn't have that last time.

576
00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:52.933 line:83%
-The study of languages.
-Makes sense.

577
00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:56.186 line:83%
He studies the entire language on his way to the point.

578
00:39:56.269 --> 00:39:59.439 line:83%
Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?

579
00:39:59.523 --> 00:40:02.442 line:83%
-Time does fly.
-Okay, let's get it over with.

580
00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:08.448 line:83%
You gotta be kidding me.

581
00:40:08.532 --> 00:40:10.909 line:83%
Well, geometry is...

582
00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:12.452 line:83%
-Is new.
-Yeah.

583
00:40:12.536 --> 00:40:14.663 line:83%
Who wouldn't want to be better at geometry?

584
00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:17.040 line:83%
And for weaknesses, "Endurance."

585
00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:21.044 line:83%
And what else? Let's see, "Heat, sun and sand."

586
00:40:23.797 --> 00:40:25.006 line:83%
Shouldn't be a problem.

587
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.927 line:83%
It's not like we're in the middle
of a goddamn desert or anything.

588
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.638 line:83%
What's the point of this guy? Who even needs this guy?

589
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:35.016 line:83%
-He can read the map.
-Easy for you to say, you got nunchucks!

590
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.353 line:83%
I've been training four hours a day for six months.

591
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.230 line:83%
Now look at me!

592
00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:42.858 line:83%
Man, it is hot out here!

593
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:46.695 line:83%
How is this guy a character in an adventure game?

594
00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:49.489 line:83%
Okay, okay, okay.

595
00:40:49.573 --> 00:40:52.492 line:83%
I just gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.

596
00:40:52.576 --> 00:40:53.743 line:83%
I know how to do that.

597
00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:55.453 line:83%
Burpees. Five burpees, right now.

598
00:40:55.537 --> 00:40:56.788 line:83%
Get it going!

599
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:01.501 line:83%
-That's one.
-One!

600
00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:09.926 line:83%
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah, come on!

601
00:41:12.053 --> 00:41:14.514 line:83%
North is that way!

602
00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:28.778 line:83%
You know, it's...

603
00:41:28.862 --> 00:41:32.282 line:83%
-It's really good to see you, Ed.
-I don't wanna hear it.

604
00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:34.826 line:83%
You don't wanna hear that it's good to see you?

605
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.538 line:83%
-You sold me out, Milo.
-I did not sell you out.

606
00:41:38.622 --> 00:41:40.749 line:83%
We sold our business. It was time.

607
00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:43.210 line:83%
-Yeah, time for who?
-Well, it was time for me.

608
00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:48.173 line:83%
Okay? Standing on my feet,
serving a hundred plates a night for 35 years?

609
00:41:48.256 --> 00:41:49.466 line:83%
I was done.

610
00:41:50.217 --> 00:41:52.093 line:83%
I was ready, man.

611
00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:53.929 line:83%
I was ready to retire.

612
00:41:54.012 --> 00:41:55.305 line:83%
I'm done talking!

613
00:42:10.362 --> 00:42:11.905 line:83%
"The Oasis."

614
00:42:14.407 --> 00:42:16.201 line:83%
I guess that's the next level.

615
00:42:20.789 --> 00:42:23.166 line:83%
The next level of the game.

616
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.668 line:83%
We're in a game?

617
00:42:24.751 --> 00:42:28.004 line:83%
-Yes, Grandpa Eddie, we are in a game.
-You can't be serious.

618
00:42:28.088 --> 00:42:29.506 line:83%
Did you know about this?

619
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:31.508 line:83%
I thought you were done talking.

620
00:42:43.687 --> 00:42:45.438 line:83%
-Bethany?
-Yep.

621
00:42:46.856 --> 00:42:49.276 line:83%
-My name's Bethany too.
-Really?

622
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:51.403 line:83%
Daddy, her name's Bethany too.

623
00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:57.784 line:83%
Sure is, sweetie.

624
00:42:58.827 --> 00:43:00.704 line:83%
Can I talk to you for a minute?

625
00:43:03.957 --> 00:43:05.625 line:83%
Sure, yeah. Come in.

626
00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:09.379 line:83%
I'm sorry, I just-- I didn't know where else to go.

627
00:43:09.462 --> 00:43:11.256 line:83%
No, no, no, it's okay.

628
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:12.966 line:83%
I'm glad you came.

629
00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:16.303 line:83%
Do you think you can help me get the machine to start?

630
00:43:19.806 --> 00:43:21.266 line:83%
That is so dangerous.

631
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:22.309 line:83%
I know.

632
00:43:24.436 --> 00:43:25.854 line:83%
But I have to try.

633
00:43:28.273 --> 00:43:29.274 line:83%
They're my team.

634
00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:45.415 line:83%
So, what exactly are we looking for again?

635
00:43:45.498 --> 00:43:47.250 line:83%
We're looking for my grandson, genius.

636
00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:50.337 line:83%
Okay, "Follow the flame to the desert fruit."

637
00:43:53.548 --> 00:43:54.424 line:83%
Look.

638
00:43:56.468 --> 00:43:57.677 line:83%
They're here.

639
00:43:57.761 --> 00:43:59.387 line:83%
Hyenas.

640
00:43:59.471 --> 00:44:02.182 line:83%
Unusual for their bone-crushing teeth.

641
00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:06.895 line:83%
Smoke Stack.

642
00:44:07.937 --> 00:44:09.773 line:83%
Where there's smoke...

643
00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:10.940 line:83%
There's fire.

644
00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:12.984 line:83%
Come on.

645
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:16.529 line:83%
You call that a roll?

646
00:44:16.613 --> 00:44:19.407 line:83%
-Not bad at all.
-I'll bet you two more, fellas!

647
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:21.659 line:83%
Drinks! Drinks over here!

648
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.328 line:83%
Another round here!

649
00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:25.372 line:83%
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

650
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.102 line:83%
I thought you'd never come back.

651
00:44:49.813 --> 00:44:51.564 line:83%
I need to talk to you.

652
00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.276 line:83%
Absolutely.

653
00:44:56.361 --> 00:44:58.905 line:83%
Not here, not now.

654
00:44:58.988 --> 00:45:00.365 line:83%
Not around them.

655
00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:08.081 line:83%
Leave me alone!

656
00:45:15.547 --> 00:45:16.798 line:83%
Fiery.

657
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:18.842 line:83%
Not a real person.

658
00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:19.884 line:83%
What'd she say?

659
00:45:19.968 --> 00:45:22.387 line:83%
She said she thought I was never gonna come back here,

660
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.432 line:83%
she wants to get together later,
and we all know what that means.

661
00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:28.893 line:83%
It means that she's got a clue for you.

662
00:45:28.977 --> 00:45:31.354 line:83%
Oh, that's a coincidence because I got a clue for her.

663
00:45:31.438 --> 00:45:33.106 line:83%
-You got a clue for her.
-Wait a minute.

664
00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:36.151 line:83%
She's your ex-girlfriend. She's the flame.

665
00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:38.027 line:83%
-"Follow the flame."
-What?

666
00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:51.332 line:83%
The jewel, it's here.

667
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.392 line:83%
Wait, is that the guy that killed my parents?

668
00:46:09.476 --> 00:46:11.936 line:83%
No. Well, yeah. Kind of.

669
00:46:14.481 --> 00:46:16.774 line:83%
We lost a good man today.

670
00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:19.611 line:83%
The very best of us.

671
00:46:21.488 --> 00:46:23.490 line:83%
For Dagfinn...

672
00:46:23.573 --> 00:46:25.742 line:83%
wasn't just my hyena master.

673
00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:28.745 line:83%
He was my friend.

674
00:46:29.078 --> 00:46:30.705 line:83%
I loved him like a brother.

675
00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:34.834 line:83%
And now he's gone.

676
00:46:35.585 --> 00:46:38.296 line:83%
And his beloved hyenas are left

677
00:46:38.379 --> 00:46:40.048 line:83%
without their master.

678
00:46:44.177 --> 00:46:45.595 line:83%
Long live Dagfinn.

679
00:46:45.678 --> 00:46:48.598 line:83%
Long live Dagfinn!

680
00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:50.934 line:83%
Why did he have to die?

681
00:46:53.478 --> 00:46:55.730 line:83%
He died because...

682
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:57.357 line:83%
he made a mistake.

683
00:46:58.024 --> 00:47:01.361 line:83%
He tried to steal something quite precious from me.

684
00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:04.364 line:83%
He left me no choice.

685
00:47:05.323 --> 00:47:06.366 line:83%
And now...

686
00:47:07.408 --> 00:47:11.913 line:83%
I feed him to his beloved hyenas.

687
00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:16.501 line:83%
That's messed up.

688
00:47:17.335 --> 00:47:19.504 line:83%
I loved Dagfinn!

689
00:47:21.214 --> 00:47:23.466 line:83%
There's none among you I love as much.

690
00:47:24.801 --> 00:47:25.635 line:83%
And so...

691
00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:32.392 line:83%
The key!

692
00:47:33.935 --> 00:47:34.769 line:83%
It's gone.

693
00:47:36.771 --> 00:47:37.897 line:83%
Thief!

694
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:40.775 line:83%
I got her. I got the thief.

695
00:47:41.734 --> 00:47:43.444 line:83%
Wait.

696
00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:45.446 line:83%
-Are you guys--?
-Come here.

697
00:47:45.989 --> 00:47:48.116 line:83%
-Catch her!
-Don't let her get away.

698
00:47:51.828 --> 00:47:54.330 line:83%
Trying to steal the key to my chest?

699
00:47:55.582 --> 00:47:56.958 line:83%
Nope.

700
00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.626 line:83%
Shake her down.

701
00:48:01.588 --> 00:48:03.298 line:83%
I'm sorry, I did it. It was my fault.

702
00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:04.424 line:83%
I...

703
00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:07.260 line:83%
I just--

704
00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:08.970 line:83%
I don't--

705
00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:11.556 line:83%
I don't know what I was... Oy vey.

706
00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:16.269 line:83%
It's like... It's like I'm hyperventilating.

707
00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:19.022 line:83%
Does anyone have, like, a eucalyptus inhaler?

708
00:48:19.105 --> 00:48:20.857 line:83%
Or a brown paper bag?

709
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:21.899 line:83%
Spencer?

710
00:48:21.983 --> 00:48:24.402 line:83%
-Is it really hot in here?
-You mean...?

711
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:27.488 line:83%
-That's him. Right there.
-What?

712
00:48:28.156 --> 00:48:31.868 line:83%
That ain't Spencer.
I know my grandson. My grandson's a guy.

713
00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:34.954 line:83%
Did he change his hair?

714
00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:38.041 line:83%
-Cut off her head.
-Yeah!

715
00:48:38.124 --> 00:48:39.876 line:83%
-Cut off her head!
-Wait, wait, wait.

716
00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:42.086 line:83%
I just think maybe don't cut off my head?

717
00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:45.006 line:83%
-Spencer!
-Oh, my.

718
00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:46.799 line:83%
-Did he just--?
-Oh, Lord.

719
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.303 line:83%
That's my Life Alert.

720
00:48:50.386 --> 00:48:51.888 line:83%
I gotta take my pill.

721
00:48:58.645 --> 00:48:59.729 line:83%
Come on!

722
00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:02.857 line:83%
Spencer!

723
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.734 line:83%
Oh, my God, you're alive.

724
00:49:05.193 --> 00:49:06.694 line:83%
What are you guys doing here?

725
00:49:06.778 --> 00:49:09.572 line:83%
What are we doing here? We came to get you, fool!

726
00:49:09.656 --> 00:49:11.532 line:83%
-Bethany?
-Not Bethany. Fridge, goddamn it!

727
00:49:12.784 --> 00:49:13.785 line:83%
What? So...

728
00:49:14.827 --> 00:49:16.913 line:83%
Milo Walker, darling.

729
00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:19.707 line:83%
Milo?

730
00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:25.171 line:83%
-Spencer? Is that you, kiddo?
-Grandpa?

731
00:49:25.254 --> 00:49:29.384 line:83%
Guys, I found Spencer.
Here's Spencer. What are you stealing for?

732
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:31.719 line:83%
I'm still me.

733
00:49:32.887 --> 00:49:33.888 line:83%
Hey.

734
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:36.140 line:83%
-Hey.
-Hey.

735
00:49:41.187 --> 00:49:42.230 line:83%
Come on.

736
00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:47.485 line:83%
Let's go.

737
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.707 line:83%
Damn it, I was so close. I had the key in my hand.

738
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.125 line:83%
Why'd you stop me?

739
00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:04.210 line:83%
Someone yelled "thief," so I grabbed you.
What do you want?

740
00:50:04.669 --> 00:50:07.797 line:83%
You guys shouldn't have come here. I had it under control.

741
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.841 line:83%
Did you? It looked like you just got murdered.

742
00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:12.635 line:83%
I mean, what the hell, Spencer? Why are you even here?

743
00:50:12.719 --> 00:50:14.011 line:83%
Why did you have the game?

744
00:50:14.095 --> 00:50:17.181 line:83%
We destroyed it so that this would never happen!

745
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.559 line:83%
I went back and got it, okay?

746
00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:22.895 line:83%
I don't know why I did it, but I did.

747
00:50:22.979 --> 00:50:24.856 line:83%
And then last night...

748
00:50:25.982 --> 00:50:29.360 line:83%
I've been in kind of a weird place,
and something came over me, okay?

749
00:50:29.444 --> 00:50:31.696 line:83%
And now we're all stuck here again!

750
00:50:31.779 --> 00:50:33.823 line:83%
I thought that I would be him.

751
00:50:34.449 --> 00:50:35.533 line:83%
Bravestone!

752
00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:38.745 line:83%
I wanted to feel like that again.

753
00:50:40.747 --> 00:50:43.583 line:83%
Like... I could do anything.

754
00:50:46.127 --> 00:50:47.253 line:83%
But instead, I'm...

755
00:50:48.671 --> 00:50:50.006 line:83%
Ming Fleetfoot.

756
00:50:52.425 --> 00:50:55.136 line:83%
"Cat burglar, pickpocket, safecracker."

757
00:50:55.428 --> 00:50:56.929 line:83%
Another better character.

758
00:50:57.013 --> 00:50:59.307 line:83%
-"Weakness: pollen."
-Yeah.

759
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:03.519 line:83%
She's small and crafty, and has allergies.
I mean, she's basically me.

760
00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.398 line:83%
I swear, man, if we survive, I am gonna kill you.

761
00:51:08.441 --> 00:51:11.194 line:83%
I just can't believe you came back here on purpose.

762
00:51:11.277 --> 00:51:13.237 line:83%
I'm sorry. Okay?

763
00:51:15.448 --> 00:51:16.282 line:83%
I'm sorry.

764
00:51:18.284 --> 00:51:19.535 line:83%
Wait!

765
00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:21.078 line:83%
Oh, there she is.

766
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:22.747 line:83%
-Who?
-My ex.

767
00:51:23.664 --> 00:51:24.499 line:83%
Okay.

768
00:51:25.458 --> 00:51:26.292 line:83%
Hi.

769
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.838 line:83%
If my husband knew I was talking to you,

770
00:51:30.922 --> 00:51:32.507 line:83%
you'd be dead by morning.

771
00:51:34.342 --> 00:51:35.802 line:83%
Don't tell him?

772
00:51:35.885 --> 00:51:40.264 line:83%
Listen to me, Jurgen and his army are returning
to his fortress.

773
00:51:40.348 --> 00:51:43.601 line:83%
There, they will meet the Brothers Kababik.

774
00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:47.188 line:83%
He will trade the Falcon Jewel, and an alliance will be formed.

775
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:50.817 line:83%
You must get the jewel before that happens.

776
00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.401 line:83%
You're our only hope,

777
00:51:52.485 --> 00:51:54.570 line:83%
so you must hurry.

778
00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:57.824 line:83%
Oh, my.

779
00:52:00.618 --> 00:52:02.245 line:83%
-Now you must go.
-Gotta go.

780
00:52:02.328 --> 00:52:05.289 line:83%
-Wait, they're gonna meet the Brothers who?
-The Brothers Kababik.

781
00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:07.375 line:83%
The Brothers Bababik.

782
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:11.212 line:83%
-Kababik?
-You must get the jewel before that happens.

783
00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:14.757 line:83%
You are our only hope, so you must hurry.

784
00:52:22.557 --> 00:52:25.935 line:83%
-I think you should explain it to us one more time.
-Wait a second.

785
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:29.564 line:83%
What about the desert fruit? Aren't you gonna lead us to that?

786
00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:31.107 line:83%
Now I must go...

787
00:52:31.649 --> 00:52:33.860 line:83%
before Switchblade realizes I'm gone.

788
00:52:35.528 --> 00:52:36.529 line:83%
What?

789
00:52:36.612 --> 00:52:38.739 line:83%
-Switchblade?
-That's his weakness.

790
00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:42.743 line:83%
I love you, Dr. Bravestone.

791
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:46.080 line:83%
And I always will.

792
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:47.039 line:83%
That...

793
00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:49.542 line:83%
is my curse.

794
00:52:53.713 --> 00:52:55.131 line:83%
I love you too!

795
00:52:56.841 --> 00:52:58.342 line:83%
Well, she seems like a nice girl.

796
00:53:03.639 --> 00:53:04.765 line:83%
We need camels.

797
00:53:06.058 --> 00:53:09.270 line:83%
Okay, if we're gonna catch up with Jurgen, we need camels.

798
00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:12.607 line:83%
And we need to find the desert fruit, whatever that is.

799
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.192 line:83%
"Follow the flame." I mean, I guess we have to follow her.

800
00:53:15.276 --> 00:53:17.862 line:83%
You guys follow her, we'll go steal some camels.

801
00:54:05.493 --> 00:54:07.328 line:83%
"Jumanji Berry Tree."

802
00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:09.330 line:83%
Jumanji berry?

803
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:10.748 line:83%
That's a desert fruit?

804
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:12.959 line:83%
I guess.

805
00:54:14.168 --> 00:54:17.338 line:83%
"In the moment of need, remember the seed."

806
00:54:18.339 --> 00:54:20.257 line:83%
A little bit of Jumanji wisdom there.

807
00:54:25.846 --> 00:54:26.847 line:83%
There it is.

808
00:54:31.852 --> 00:54:34.105 line:83%
Okay, Milo and I will break in and get the camels.

809
00:54:34.188 --> 00:54:36.941 line:83%
Grandpa, you stay here on lookout, all right?
Keep a low profile.

810
00:54:37.024 --> 00:54:39.360 line:83%
Got it? Low profile.

811
00:54:39.443 --> 00:54:43.990 line:83%
If anyone tries to enter the livery,
just, I don't know, whistle or something.

812
00:54:44.073 --> 00:54:45.449 line:83%
Sure thing.

813
00:54:49.745 --> 00:54:51.205 line:83%
That's not when you smolder.

814
00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:53.165 line:83%
It's not the moment for it.

815
00:54:53.249 --> 00:54:55.459 line:83%
-Forget it.
-I just did it. I don't know what it was.

816
00:54:55.543 --> 00:54:57.753 line:83%
Look like your stomach is upset.

817
00:54:57.837 --> 00:54:59.547 line:83%
Like you ate something bad.

818
00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:03.509 line:83%
Oh, man.

819
00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:04.969 line:83%
I'm sweating.

820
00:55:05.052 --> 00:55:06.137 line:83%
I'm sweating.

821
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:11.100 line:83%
Stealing makes me very uncomfortable,
which is not ideal for a burglar.

822
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.874 line:83%
So the fruit is in the tree.

823
00:55:35.833 --> 00:55:40.296 line:83%
But you can't get to it without going
through the water or whatever that is.

824
00:55:40.588 --> 00:55:43.257 line:83%
Get boiled or eaten by piranhas or something.

825
00:55:47.053 --> 00:55:48.512 line:83%
"Follow the flame."

826
00:55:49.972 --> 00:55:51.599 line:83%
I think that's how we get there.

827
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:55.519 line:83%
But I don't know how I'm supposed to make that jump.

828
00:55:55.603 --> 00:55:57.229 line:83%
I mean, it's doable...

829
00:55:58.314 --> 00:56:00.608 line:83%
but I don't have my usual explosiveness.

830
00:56:02.735 --> 00:56:03.778 line:83%
Yo!

831
00:56:15.748 --> 00:56:16.707 line:83%
Yes!

832
00:56:20.044 --> 00:56:21.045 line:83%
Martha!

833
00:56:25.299 --> 00:56:26.717 line:83%
Martha!

834
00:56:32.473 --> 00:56:35.059 line:83%
-Martha!
-Oh, it's really heavy.

835
00:56:37.269 --> 00:56:39.146 line:83%
You okay? Give me your hand.

836
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.064 line:83%
There you go.

837
00:56:53.494 --> 00:56:54.495 line:83%
Wait a second.

838
00:56:55.246 --> 00:56:56.705 line:83%
-What...?
-The hell, man?

839
00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.291 line:83%
Oh, my God!

840
00:56:59.375 --> 00:57:01.210 line:83%
-The hell, man?!
-Oh, my God.

841
00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:05.381 line:83%
-Fridge?
-Yeah.

842
00:57:06.132 --> 00:57:07.133 line:83%
Martha?

843
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:09.051 line:83%
Yeah.

844
00:57:15.558 --> 00:57:17.560 line:83%
Hey, move along. Nothing to see here.

845
00:57:18.727 --> 00:57:19.854 line:83%
What'd you say?

846
00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:22.898 line:83%
I said, keep walking, pal. Nothing to see here. Beat it.

847
00:57:24.275 --> 00:57:27.820 line:83%
-What'd you say?
-I said, beat it, get out of here.

848
00:57:28.737 --> 00:57:29.864 line:83%
What'd you say?

849
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:41.959 line:83%
I said, scram!

850
00:57:49.884 --> 00:57:51.135 line:83%
You want a piece of me?

851
00:57:51.427 --> 00:57:53.179 line:83%
Yeah, come on, come on.

852
00:57:54.096 --> 00:57:56.182 line:83%
What do you got? What do you got? Come on!

853
00:57:57.641 --> 00:57:59.810 line:83%
Come and get it. Yeah!

854
00:58:03.272 --> 00:58:05.274 line:83%
Come on, you bastards!

855
00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:10.779 line:83%
Here, camel, camel.

856
00:58:12.156 --> 00:58:13.574 line:83%
Come on, let's go.

857
00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:18.329 line:83%
They are proud and majestic animals, aren't they?

858
00:58:23.334 --> 00:58:24.376 line:83%
You're welcome.

859
00:58:26.795 --> 00:58:29.715 line:83%
Did you--? Were you just talking to them?

860
00:58:31.759 --> 00:58:33.719 line:83%
Press your menu. It's right here.

861
00:58:36.263 --> 00:58:37.681 line:83%
"Linguistics."

862
00:58:37.765 --> 00:58:39.475 line:83%
You can talk to animals.

863
00:58:39.558 --> 00:58:40.601 line:83%
Yes.

864
00:58:40.684 --> 00:58:43.145 line:83%
It appears that I speak camel.

865
00:58:43.229 --> 00:58:46.899 line:83%
-Can you ask them to, like, come with us and be--?
-Excuse me.

866
00:58:49.318 --> 00:58:51.111 line:83%
They're willing to talk.

867
00:58:51.195 --> 00:58:54.573 line:83%
They wanna know what's in it for them
and how much luggage we have.

868
00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:57.618 line:83%
Will you look at me?

869
00:58:58.994 --> 00:59:01.538 line:83%
I mean, what am I supposed to do with this?

870
00:59:01.622 --> 00:59:03.165 line:83%
You read the map.

871
00:59:03.249 --> 00:59:05.584 line:83%
I don't wanna read the map. I'm supposed to be her.

872
00:59:05.668 --> 00:59:08.671 line:83%
Instead, there's actual hair growing out of my face!

873
00:59:08.754 --> 00:59:12.091 line:83%
Sorry. All bodies are beautiful, even this one.

874
00:59:13.217 --> 00:59:14.134 line:83%
Wait a second.

875
00:59:21.058 --> 00:59:22.977 line:83%
-This is amazing!
-Careful.

876
00:59:24.228 --> 00:59:25.062 line:83%
Fridge...

877
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:31.193 line:83%
Yo, this thing is insane!

878
00:59:31.277 --> 00:59:34.738 line:83%
-Be careful. That body is not a toy.
-No, it's a machine.

879
00:59:34.822 --> 00:59:35.990 line:83%
And on top of that...

880
00:59:37.324 --> 00:59:38.367 line:83%
boobs.

881
00:59:38.951 --> 00:59:40.953 line:83%
Touch my boobs and I will murder you.

882
00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:42.913 line:83%
Too late. It was the first thing I did.

883
00:59:46.375 --> 00:59:48.377 line:83%
Hey, hey, don't do that.

884
00:59:49.336 --> 00:59:52.840 line:83%
-Let's take this Jumanji berry and go meet them.
-Relax, girl.

885
00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:55.092 line:83%
I'm trying that flying acrobat thing you did.

886
00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:57.928 line:83%
-Don't. We have the berry. It's not necessary.
-Check this out.

887
00:59:58.012 --> 01:00:00.180 line:83%
-Omaha, Omaha! Hut, hut, hike!
-Wait.

888
01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.686 line:83%
Fridge, be careful! I am telling you, that body's a weapon.

889
01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.355 line:83%
-You don't even know what it's capable of.
-This is amazing!

890
01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:12.651 line:83%
-That body's a loaded gun!
-Yeah! And this gun's about to go off!

891
01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.405 line:83%
Oh, my God!

892
01:00:17.156 --> 01:00:18.198 line:83%
Fridge!

893
01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:19.825 line:83%
Come here.

894
01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:23.203 line:83%
-Oh, my God.
-Goddamn it!

895
01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:25.039 line:83%
Here, I got you. I got ya.

896
01:00:37.176 --> 01:00:40.054 line:83%
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

897
01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.264 line:83%
Oh, my God, that was awful.

898
01:00:42.348 --> 01:00:44.308 line:83%
I hate being the map guy!

899
01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:48.979 line:83%
Let's get out of here.

900
01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:55.944 line:83%
Switchblade!

901
01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:57.029 line:83%
There he is.

902
01:00:58.364 --> 01:00:59.531 line:83%
Bravestone!

903
01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:02.242 line:83%
I told you to stay the hell away from my wife!

904
01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:09.041 line:83%
-We got company.
-What did you do?

905
01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:12.211 line:83%
All right, guys, this is the moment. We need you now.

906
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.342 line:83%
They said that we can get away out the back door.

907
01:01:19.927 --> 01:01:21.470 line:83%
Are you talking to that camel?

908
01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:22.805 line:83%
Yes.

909
01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:24.681 line:83%
That's Lucille and Hank.

910
01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:26.392 line:83%
And Jeffrey's in the back.

911
01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:35.609 line:83%
-Hey!
-Hey.

912
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.155 line:83%
-We should get going.
-What happened?

913
01:01:40.239 --> 01:01:44.034 line:83%
My grandpa beat up 45 strangers for no reason,
and now that woman's husband is trying to kill him.

914
01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.079 line:83%
Is that the desert fruit?

915
01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:50.749 line:83%
Yeah. It's a Jumanji berry, and it weighs like 100 pounds.

916
01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.292 line:83%
My grandpa will carry it.

917
01:01:55.838 --> 01:01:58.298 line:83%
-We should get out of here. Come on, Grandpa.
-Let's go.

918
01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:00.634 line:83%
-I could take them.
-What?

919
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.387 line:83%
-What are you talking about? We escaped.
-I said, I could take them.

920
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.515 line:83%
-Oh, Eddie.
-No, Grandpa Eddie, that's Switchblade!

921
01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:08.684 line:83%
I'm telling you, there's a time when you run,

922
01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:12.062 line:83%
then there's a time in life, like right now, where you stay...

923
01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.194 line:83%
Yeah!

924
01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:20.863 line:83%
-Yeah!
-Switchblade! Switchblade!

925
01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.781 line:83%
Nice shot, Switchblade!

926
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.841 line:83%
What?

927
01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:56.607 line:83%
We should see Mount Zhatmire pretty soon.

928
01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:02.821 line:83%
You know, Gladys and I took a road trip before she passed.

929
01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:05.282 line:83%
We went on a ceramics tour

930
01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:06.909 line:83%
through the Southwest.

931
01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:10.621 line:83%
I lost my restaurant so you could drive around
and look at ashtrays?

932
01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:11.747 line:83%
Yes, Ed.

933
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:14.291 line:83%
That's what you do when you retire.

934
01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:16.168 line:83%
You explore your interests.

935
01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:18.420 line:83%
I don't have interests.

936
01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:21.215 line:83%
Guys like me, we don't retire!

937
01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:25.177 line:83%
We work, and then we keep working,
and then, eventually, we die.

938
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.553 line:83%
But you retired me.

939
01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:28.180 line:83%
You retired me.

940
01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:31.683 line:83%
-It's a wonder I lasted as long as I did.
-What?

941
01:03:31.767 --> 01:03:35.687 line:83%
-You're a difficult man, Ed.
-You don't abandon your best friend, Milo.

942
01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:38.232 line:83%
When I lost the restaurant, I lost everything!

943
01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:39.566 line:83%
You--?

944
01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:42.986 line:83%
Yes. Yes, I know he is.

945
01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:46.240 line:83%
-What? Are you talking to my camel?
-Yes, I'm talking to the camel.

946
01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.491 line:83%
And he can tell

947
01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.826 line:83%
that you're a pain in the ass.

948
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.287 line:83%
My camel's taking your side?

949
01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:55.832 line:83%
And he's not your camel.

950
01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:57.709 line:83%
He's just giving you a ride.

951
01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:02.005 line:83%
Well, how about the both of you go screw yourselves?

952
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:04.216 line:83%
-What did you just say?
-Guys!

953
01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.636 line:83%
You and me, we gonna settle this right here, right now!

954
01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:10.889 line:83%
-I'll show you.
-What are you doing?

955
01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:13.016 line:83%
-Don't worry about it.
-Milo, what are you doing?

956
01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:16.687 line:83%
Hold on. Wait, wait. Here we go.

957
01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:24.319 line:83%
You want a piece of me, huh? That's what you want?

958
01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:26.989 line:83%
You do not want a piece of him, Milo, I'm telling you.

959
01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:29.491 line:83%
Oh, that's where you're wrong, young man.

960
01:04:29.575 --> 01:04:31.660 line:83%
Because I do want a piece.

961
01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:33.245 line:83%
I want a big piece.

962
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:39.042 line:83%
See, Eddie, what you don't know is that for the last 15 years,

963
01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:41.503 line:83%
I've been studying tai chi.

964
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.005 line:83%
And right now,

965
01:04:43.088 --> 01:04:45.382 line:83%
I am harnessing my chi.

966
01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:48.594 line:83%
And when I'm done, I'm gonna whup your ass.

967
01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:51.722 line:83%
Milo, I am telling you, this is not a good idea.

968
01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.144 line:83%
No!

969
01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:05.986 line:83%
Dude!

970
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.280 line:83%
You gotta stop killing everybody.

971
01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:17.914 line:83%
All right, then.

972
01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:19.583 line:83%
I guess that's settled.

973
01:05:33.305 --> 01:05:35.140 line:83%
The camels just stopped.

974
01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:40.604 line:83%
This is as far as they go.

975
01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:42.731 line:83%
To get to Jurgen's fortress,

976
01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:46.151 line:83%
they said that we can head down this path here
and make a right.

977
01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:47.778 line:83%
Then we're in his territory.

978
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.906 line:83%
And they don't wanna go there
because they don't want to die.

979
01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.493 line:83%
We don't wanna die either.

980
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.917 line:83%
The worst Bravestone of all time.

981
01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:39.329 line:83%
So we have to get across... this.

982
01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.627 line:83%
Okay, we can do this. We can do this.

983
01:06:45.711 --> 01:06:48.130 line:83%
We just have to take our time and make careful decisions.

984
01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:49.965 line:83%
What are you talking about? It's obvious.

985
01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:53.927 line:83%
We start on that bridge right there,
then jump to that one that heads to right at 30 degrees,

986
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:57.681 line:83%
and then those two that look like two sides of a trapezoid...

987
01:06:57.764 --> 01:06:59.266 line:83%
Geometry.

988
01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:00.767 line:83%
That's what it's for!

989
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.687 line:83%
Maybe this character's not totally worthless.

990
01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.815 line:83%
-I'll go first.
-Really?

991
01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:13.613 line:83%
You see? It's no big deal.

992
01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:17.826 line:83%
-What's going on?
-No, no, no.

993
01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:18.910 line:83%
Oh, no.

994
01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:22.748 line:83%
-No.
-Grandpa!

995
01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.836 line:83%
Oh, crap.

996
01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:33.175 line:83%
What the hell?

997
01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:38.972 line:83%
-It's okay. We can do this.
-Yeah?

998
01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.807 line:83%
It's just about finding the right timing.

999
01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:42.684 line:83%
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Follow me.

1000
01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:48.648 line:83%
Come on!

1001
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.276 line:83%
Come on, Milo, come on!

1002
01:07:57.699 --> 01:07:58.950 line:83%
-Oh, Lord.
-Here.

1003
01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:00.535 line:83%
Okay.

1004
01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:07.501 line:83%
Hey, you guys.

1005
01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.669 line:83%
Is that rock moving?

1006
01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:17.219 line:83%
-Oh, no.
-What?

1007
01:08:17.302 --> 01:08:19.554 line:83%
Well, now, this is a problem.

1008
01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.139 line:83%
Come on, what is it?

1009
01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:22.265 line:83%
-Oh, my.
-What?

1010
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:23.517 line:83%
-Spit it out!
-What is it?

1011
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.685 line:83%
-Just tell us!
-Tell us! Milo!

1012
01:08:31.525 --> 01:08:33.235 line:83%
Those are mandrills.

1013
01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:35.529 line:83%
-We should go. Go, go!
-Go!

1014
01:08:39.574 --> 01:08:41.701 line:83%
That one! Obtuse angle!

1015
01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:47.958 line:83%
Note the distinctive and colorful pigment
around their face and buttocks.

1016
01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:54.381 line:83%
Mandrills are the heaviest of all monkeys.

1017
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:58.593 line:83%
Even heavier than baboons,
with which they are often confused.

1018
01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:03.348 line:83%
And now head for the rhombus!

1019
01:09:03.431 --> 01:09:04.933 line:83%
Come on. Hurry up.

1020
01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:06.810 line:83%
-Rhombus! Rhombus!
-Come on.

1021
01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.654 line:83%
No, Martha!

1022
01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.781 line:83%
-Not that one! You're on the wrong bridge!
-What?

1023
01:09:19.865 --> 01:09:21.366 line:83%
The perpendicular one!

1024
01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:29.708 line:83%
Martha!

1025
01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:37.173 line:83%
Martha!

1026
01:09:40.302 --> 01:09:41.678 line:83%
No!

1027
01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.598 line:83%
No!

1028
01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:46.975 line:83%
Spencer, behind you!

1029
01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:50.604 line:83%
Jump!

1030
01:09:51.771 --> 01:09:52.981 line:83%
Come on, I got you!

1031
01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:56.318 line:83%
Spencer!

1032
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.786 line:83%
Oh, no! No! No!

1033
01:10:17.005 --> 01:10:18.173 line:83%
Oh, no! No!

1034
01:10:19.424 --> 01:10:20.508 line:83%
Get off!

1035
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.266 line:83%
Come on.

1036
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.774 line:83%
All right, bring it on.

1037
01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:39.402 line:83%
Come on, come here.

1038
01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:43.782 line:83%
Grandpa!

1039
01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:46.534 line:83%
Grandpa! Enough!

1040
01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:48.078 line:83%
-Grandpa, stop!
-Yeah!

1041
01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.329 line:83%
They're gone!

1042
01:11:00.632 --> 01:11:01.466 line:83%
Come on!

1043
01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.099 line:83%
Give me your hand!

1044
01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:10.642 line:83%
-What?!
-Trust me!

1045
01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:33.248 line:83%
Go.

1046
01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:37.460 line:83%
Last one. Aim for the center of the parabola!

1047
01:11:40.714 --> 01:11:42.549 line:83%
Oh, damn.

1048
01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:43.550 line:83%
Son of a...

1049
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.185 line:83%
-Eddie?
-Milo!

1050
01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:55.729 line:83%
Eddie!

1051
01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.147 line:83%
Hey, Eddie, where you going?

1052
01:11:58.356 --> 01:11:59.899 line:83%
I need your help, Eddie.

1053
01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:02.861 line:83%
Eddie!

1054
01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.293 line:83%
Eddie! Milo!

1055
01:12:39.606 --> 01:12:41.733 line:83%
-Seriously?
-Later.

1056
01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:43.902 line:83%
-Run!
-Run!

1057
01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:19.729 line:83%
Hey, guys.

1058
01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:21.648 line:83%
Who the hell's this?

1059
01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:25.735 line:83%
-Alex, what are you doing here?
-Bethany thought you might need some help.

1060
01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:28.863 line:83%
-Where is Bethany?
-She's right here.

1061
01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.032 line:83%
You mean...?

1062
01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:38.623 line:83%
"Oh, my God, right?

1063
01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:40.917 line:83%
Like, I'm a total horse.

1064
01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:44.045 line:83%
I can't believe that we found you guys.

1065
01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.757 line:83%
-Hi."
-Yep, that's Bethany.

1066
01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:50.927 line:83%
-What's up, girl?
-Hey.

1067
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:54.305 line:83%
Oh, we brought you some clothes. You must be freezing.

1068
01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:03.189 line:83%
So this horse is a character in the game?

1069
01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:04.107 line:83%
Yeah.

1070
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:05.400 line:83%
Cyclone's his name.

1071
01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:10.655 line:83%
-How's that feel?
-I don't know. I sprained it pretty good.

1072
01:14:11.239 --> 01:14:12.866 line:83%
Where'd you get these clothes?

1073
01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:16.119 line:83%
When I realized how far north we were going,
we stopped to go shopping.

1074
01:14:16.703 --> 01:14:17.787 line:83%
You can shop here?

1075
01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:21.332 line:83%
-How did you know how to do that?
-I was here for 20 years, kiddo.

1076
01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:23.418 line:83%
At least I got rid of that stupid hat.

1077
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.919 line:83%
Now I got this stupid hat.

1078
01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:43.021 line:83%
It's something, isn't it?

1079
01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:46.024 line:83%
Yeah, it's something.

1080
01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:50.236 line:83%
You know, Eddie,

1081
01:14:51.446 --> 01:14:55.074 line:83%
you didn't lose everything when you lost the restaurant.

1082
01:14:56.284 --> 01:14:57.952 line:83%
You still got a lot, man.

1083
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.125 line:83%
I lost my friend.

1084
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.463 line:83%
So did I.

1085
01:15:22.477 --> 01:15:23.895 line:83%
I'm sorry, Milo.

1086
01:15:31.069 --> 01:15:32.904 line:83%
Hey, I'm sorry too, Eddie.

1087
01:15:34.072 --> 01:15:36.532 line:83%
I should have tracked you down a long time ago.

1088
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.745 line:83%
I'm glad you came over for coffee.

1089
01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:46.417 line:83%
What made you do it, huh?

1090
01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:49.295 line:83%
I mean, why now?

1091
01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:54.384 line:83%
Milo, what's going on?

1092
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:01.557 line:83%
You're sick.

1093
01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:06.896 line:83%
How bad?

1094
01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:10.733 line:83%
I don't have much time left.

1095
01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:16.114 line:83%
Son of a bitch.

1096
01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:18.116 line:83%
But I count myself lucky, Eddie.

1097
01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:20.994 line:83%
I was married to a wonderful woman.

1098
01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:24.247 line:83%
I got to live a wonderful life.

1099
01:16:24.706 --> 01:16:27.250 line:83%
And not everybody can say that.

1100
01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:29.794 line:83%
That's why I wanted to make things better with you.

1101
01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:32.297 line:83%
And now that they are...

1102
01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:34.507 line:83%
well, I'm...

1103
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:37.218 line:83%
I'm happy about that too.

1104
01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.817 line:83%
Grandpa, Milo.

1105
01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:54.777 line:83%
Come on, we gotta go.

1106
01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:03.244 line:83%
"The Fortress."

1107
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:05.496 line:83%
Looks like the last level.

1108
01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.417 line:83%
Okay, so we climb that mountain
and then we sneak in somehow.

1109
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.920 line:83%
Yeah, and then we steal the jewel
before the Brothers Kababik get there.

1110
01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:15.757 line:83%
-And then show it to the sun?
-Sounds like a plan.

1111
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.758 line:83%
What?!

1112
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.928 line:83%
I'm sorry, I think I missed the "plan" part of the plan.

1113
01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:24.349 line:83%
That last level almost killed us all. I can barely walk.

1114
01:17:24.432 --> 01:17:26.517 line:83%
Your grandpa beats the hell out of the wrong guy,

1115
01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:29.645 line:83%
or we get attacked by a polar bear,
what am I supposed to do?

1116
01:17:29.729 --> 01:17:31.272 line:83%
I'm not gonna beat up the wrong guy.

1117
01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:34.359 line:83%
You are gonna beat up the wrong guy!
You're not a good Bravestone!

1118
01:17:34.776 --> 01:17:38.071 line:83%
You're too stubborn and pissed off,
and you keep getting us killed.

1119
01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:39.739 line:83%
What the hell you talking about?

1120
01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:41.407 line:83%
And Milo--

1121
01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.493 line:83%
And I say this with all due respect, sir.

1122
01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:45.912 line:83%
--is not a good person to be the zoologist.

1123
01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:49.874 line:83%
He talks too slow, and by the time
he gets to the point, you're dead!

1124
01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.334 line:83%
Once again, no offense.

1125
01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:52.335 line:83%
None taken.

1126
01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.045 line:83%
And let me tell you why.

1127
01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:56.339 line:83%
-Because my friend Bernard--
-You see?

1128
01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:00.927 line:83%
You're a thief who's too neurotic to steal anything,
Bethany's a horse...

1129
01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:04.931 line:83%
All I know is, we are stuck here again,

1130
01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:08.601 line:83%
we are running out of lives and my ankle is killing me!

1131
01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:11.145 line:83%
-Oh, my God!
-Fridge!

1132
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:13.564 line:83%
Fridge! Are you okay?

1133
01:18:14.774 --> 01:18:17.318 line:83%
Yo, you guys gotta see this!

1134
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:32.041 line:83%
That's what the water looked like at the tree.

1135
01:18:33.418 --> 01:18:34.752 line:83%
When we...

1136
01:18:34.836 --> 01:18:36.838 line:83%
-switched bodies.
-Switched bodies.

1137
01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:20.214 line:83%
Goddamn, that is cold!

1138
01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.760 line:83%
Oh, man! It's freezing!

1139
01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.053 line:83%
What the hell, man?

1140
01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.348 line:83%
Yes!

1141
01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:30.725 line:83%
I missed you so much.

1142
01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:32.727 line:83%
Oh, my God, you guys, hi.

1143
01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:34.645 line:83%
Spencer?

1144
01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.524 line:83%
-Hey.
-Hey.

1145
01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.572 line:83%
-Grandpa?
-Yeah, what?

1146
01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:48.451 line:83%
Milo?

1147
01:19:51.496 --> 01:19:52.914 line:83%
You should see the size of your--

1148
01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:56.167 line:83%
Damn.

1149
01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:58.544 line:83%
I never thought I'd be this happy to shrink.

1150
01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:01.923 line:83%
I have never seen anything quite like that before.

1151
01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:05.718 line:83%
Oh, my God, it's so good to be able to talk again with words.

1152
01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.929 line:83%
Spencer, hi!

1153
01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:10.181 line:83%
-Hey, Bethany.
-We have so much catching up to do.

1154
01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:11.682 line:83%
I wanna hear about New York.

1155
01:20:11.766 --> 01:20:14.560 line:83%
But it feels like maybe this isn't the perfect, like, moment.

1156
01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:16.938 line:83%
Right. Like, later.

1157
01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:17.980 line:83%
Later.

1158
01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:20.650 line:83%
Better?

1159
01:20:21.526 --> 01:20:22.652 line:83%
Yeah.

1160
01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:23.569 line:83%
Much.

1161
01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:29.659 line:83%
I got hair!

1162
01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:33.538 line:83%
For the first time in 40 years. I gotta go tell Milo.

1163
01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:35.706 line:83%
-Be careful out there, Grandpa.
-Yeah.

1164
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:37.250 line:83%
How's your ankle?

1165
01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:38.167 line:83%
Your ankle.

1166
01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:41.295 line:83%
It's a little sore, but definitely not as bad
as you were making it seem.

1167
01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:43.130 line:83%
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

1168
01:20:43.214 --> 01:20:46.050 line:83%
You were making a really big deal of it and it's not that bad.

1169
01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:54.725 line:83%
-Hey! Get the hell away from that horse!
-Freeze!

1170
01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.186 line:83%
Milo! Hey!

1171
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:58.813 line:83%
Wait, which ankle was it?

1172
01:20:58.896 --> 01:21:00.106 line:83%
-Hold it.
-Hey, hey, hey.

1173
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.732 line:83%
Get your hands off of me.

1174
01:21:01.816 --> 01:21:04.026 line:83%
Hey! I'm with you, Milo.

1175
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.194 line:83%
I'm right here.

1176
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.783 line:83%
Guys, guys.

1177
01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.327 line:83%
Eddie and Milo.

1178
01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:14.412 line:83%
They got them.

1179
01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.421 line:83%
There's ice everywhere,

1180
01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.631 line:83%
and there's only one road in.

1181
01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:28.009 line:83%
It's covered with guards though.
I don't know how we'll get in there.

1182
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:32.597 line:83%
Oh, okay.

1183
01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.808 line:83%
I see a dungeon at the top of this ice wall.

1184
01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.019 line:83%
That must be where they're keeping your grandpa.

1185
01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:42.732 line:83%
And Milo is probably in this, like, barn thing
all the way on the other side of the place.

1186
01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:44.984 line:83%
Okay. We gotta split up.

1187
01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.695 line:83%
One team goes to get Milo,
the other team busts out my grandpa.

1188
01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:49.739 line:83%
But how do we get in?

1189
01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:52.908 line:83%
Fridge, do you have any ice-climbing equipment
in your backpack?

1190
01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:57.204 line:83%
You mean something like this?

1191
01:21:58.331 --> 01:22:00.625 line:83%
-Just like that.
-See?

1192
01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:02.835 line:83%
That's why I'm the backpack guy.

1193
01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.795 line:83%
-That's why.
-Yeah. You're great at that.

1194
01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:06.047 line:83%
Yeah, I know.

1195
01:22:06.881 --> 01:22:09.300 line:83%
Martha, will you come with me?

1196
01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.801 line:83%
Of course.

1197
01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:22.980 line:83%
I forgot what this part feels like.

1198
01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:25.149 line:83%
It's scary.

1199
01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:28.861 line:83%
-Yeah.
-Hey.

1200
01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:32.406 line:83%
We can do it. This team can do anything.

1201
01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:35.493 line:83%
Nobody knows that better than me.

1202
01:22:35.993 --> 01:22:38.329 line:83%
-Yeah.
-Come on, you guys.

1203
01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.247 line:83%
Bring it in.

1204
01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:46.003 line:83%
Be aggressive.

1205
01:22:46.087 --> 01:22:47.546 line:83%
Be, be aggressive.

1206
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:50.341 line:83%
Be aggressive. Be, be aggressive.

1207
01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:51.467 line:83%
Come on, guys.

1208
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:54.512 line:83%
-That's not what I thought this was. No.
-We should just go.

1209
01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.514 line:83%
Okay, just-- Go, team.

1210
01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:16.117 line:83%
Okay. I'm gonna try to sneak in with them.

1211
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:20.621 line:83%
-In this outfit, I might be able to pass. You guys stay here--
-What? No way.

1212
01:23:20.705 --> 01:23:22.123 line:83%
Now's the moment. Stay here.

1213
01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:24.500 line:83%
-Alex, no!
-Go. Good luck, Alex.

1214
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.382 line:83%
-Come on.
-What are you talking about, "Come on"? Bethany.

1215
01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:32.341 line:83%
Bethany!

1216
01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:37.096 line:83%
Turn right.

1217
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:57.074 line:83%
You there. Stay where you are.

1218
01:23:57.158 --> 01:23:58.534 line:83%
Who, us?

1219
01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:00.786 line:83%
Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1220
01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:04.498 line:83%
-Are we the who?
-Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1221
01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:07.126 line:83%
Yes.

1222
01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:09.462 line:83%
We are them. It is we. Us.

1223
01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.631 line:83%
We are the Brothers Cadabra-- Kadabrik.

1224
01:24:13.591 --> 01:24:14.633 line:83%
He is one brother,

1225
01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:18.596 line:83%
and I am the other brother.

1226
01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:21.599 line:83%
We-- We got different mothers.

1227
01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:26.771 line:83%
But we... We came to get the thing that we came to get.

1228
01:24:29.190 --> 01:24:30.524 line:83%
Brothers Kababik,

1229
01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:32.443 line:83%
on behalf of Jurgen the Brutal,

1230
01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:34.862 line:83%
welcome to Zhatmire Stronghold.

1231
01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:36.906 line:83%
Thank you.

1232
01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:57.593 line:83%
There's something I have to ask you.

1233
01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:00.262 line:83%
Okay.

1234
01:25:00.346 --> 01:25:03.224 line:83%
Why didn't you come visit when you were supposed to?

1235
01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:06.185 line:83%
You cancel the first time,
then you were gonna come for Halloween.

1236
01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:07.895 line:83%
You cancel again.

1237
01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:11.106 line:83%
And then the next time I hear from you,
you tell me we should take a break?

1238
01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:18.113 line:83%
It's just... I saw all your pictures on Instagram,

1239
01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:20.533 line:83%
and you looked like you were having so much fun, and...

1240
01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:26.330 line:83%
I just got really insecure or something.
Like I wasn't the guy I thought I was.

1241
01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:32.503 line:83%
Or I wasn't the guy you thought I was.
Which would be even worse.

1242
01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:36.632 line:83%
Spencer, do you think I'm not...

1243
01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:39.677 line:83%
totally terrified all the time?

1244
01:25:40.094 --> 01:25:44.348 line:83%
I got to school, and suddenly,
for the first time ever, people really liked me.

1245
01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:47.852 line:83%
But I'm always thinking that...

1246
01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:50.187 line:83%
I don't know, like it's...

1247
01:25:50.271 --> 01:25:54.275 line:83%
Like it's just a matter of time
before somebody figures out who I really am.

1248
01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:56.402 line:83%
But then I see you.

1249
01:25:58.404 --> 01:26:01.240 line:83%
And you're the person who makes me feel good...

1250
01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:02.741 line:83%
about who I really am.

1251
01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:06.579 line:83%
When you're, like, scared and insecure,

1252
01:26:07.621 --> 01:26:09.832 line:83%
that's when you need your people the most.

1253
01:26:21.427 --> 01:26:22.636 line:83%
Hey, Mr. Walker.

1254
01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:25.764 line:83%
Why the long face?

1255
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:29.727 line:83%
Dad joke. Sorry. Can't help it.

1256
01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:33.439 line:83%
Let's get you out of here.

1257
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.094 line:83%
Okay.

1258
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.931 line:83%
It's just an obstacle course.

1259
01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:08.390 line:83%
You were good at those.

1260
01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:26.867 line:83%
All right, all right, get a room.

1261
01:27:30.663 --> 01:27:33.457 line:83%
Grandpa... let's get you out of there.

1262
01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:34.750 line:83%
Here.

1263
01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:42.508 line:83%
-Let's blow this joint, huh?
-We still have to find the jewel, Grandpa.

1264
01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:45.094 line:83%
It must be in a vault or a treasure room or something.

1265
01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:46.971 line:83%
Yeah, that's how it works in these games.

1266
01:27:47.513 --> 01:27:51.809 line:83%
I passed a vault on the way up to this dump.
Single access, 3-foot-thick steel door.

1267
01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:54.019 line:83%
Only way in is through a grate in the ceiling.

1268
01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:07.992 line:83%
I think I got it now.

1269
01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:12.287 line:83%
Just stay on...

1270
01:28:13.414 --> 01:28:14.623 line:83%
the raised ones.

1271
01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:40.065 line:83%
Jurgen the Brutal awaits.

1272
01:28:42.443 --> 01:28:46.530 line:83%
So, tell me, which brother is which?

1273
01:28:49.783 --> 01:28:50.993 line:83%
How do you mean?

1274
01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:52.661 line:83%
Which brother is which?

1275
01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:57.374 line:83%
Which of you is Augustus and which is Tomatoli?

1276
01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.671 line:83%
I am Augustus.

1277
01:29:03.881 --> 01:29:05.966 line:83%
And I'm Tomatolik.

1278
01:29:07.217 --> 01:29:09.303 line:83%
Augustus Kababik.

1279
01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:12.389 line:83%
The cleverest man in all of Jumanji.

1280
01:29:13.891 --> 01:29:15.434 line:83%
Yes, I'm totally that man.

1281
01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:18.729 line:83%
-And Tomatoli Kababik.
-That's me.

1282
01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:20.105 line:83%
The bravest eunuch.

1283
01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.568 line:83%
-Wait a minute, what?
-Did you say, "Eunuch"?

1284
01:29:24.651 --> 01:29:25.986 line:83%
Tomatoli Kababik,

1285
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:29.990 line:83%
everyone knows the tale
of your great and generous sacrifice.

1286
01:29:30.074 --> 01:29:35.204 line:83%
How you gave your testicles
in order to save the region from the floods.

1287
01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:37.456 line:83%
-I think there might be a little confusion.
-Of course.

1288
01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:42.044 line:83%
Everybody knows the story about my little brother
and his famous testicles.

1289
01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:45.464 line:83%
-Wherever they may be.
-Wherever they may be.

1290
01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:47.091 line:83%
All right, let's back up.

1291
01:29:47.174 --> 01:29:50.427 line:83%
-Let's go back a little bit. Let's clear some stuff up.
-He's super brave.

1292
01:29:50.511 --> 01:29:54.807 line:83%
I've always been the super clever one,
and he's always been super brave.

1293
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.225 line:83%
And super ball-less.

1294
01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:59.603 line:83%
-Stop saying that! Both of my balls are right here!
-In spirit.

1295
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:02.648 line:83%
They're here in spirit.

1296
01:30:03.774 --> 01:30:04.691 line:83%
Always.

1297
01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:07.027 line:83%
Of course.

1298
01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:09.029 line:83%
Right, bro?

1299
01:30:14.243 --> 01:30:15.244 line:83%
Right.

1300
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:18.205 line:83%
I got no balls.

1301
01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:26.004 line:83%
There's the chest.

1302
01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:29.049 line:83%
Okay. You're up, Grandpa.

1303
01:30:29.133 --> 01:30:31.844 line:83%
-Who, me?
-Yes. You're the cat burglar.

1304
01:30:32.845 --> 01:30:34.221 line:83%
Your character, Ming.

1305
01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:35.222 line:83%
Ming?

1306
01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:37.349 line:83%
Yes, Ming. That's your avatar. That's her name.

1307
01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:39.351 line:83%
In your satchel, you have a set of lockpicks.

1308
01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:42.104 line:83%
Lockpicks? Why would I have lockpicks?

1309
01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:43.939 line:83%
Because Ming's the cat burglar.

1310
01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:47.568 line:83%
-Don't you think one of you should do this?
-You have the skills.

1311
01:30:47.651 --> 01:30:48.986 line:83%
I have the skills?

1312
01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:51.155 line:83%
Not you. Ming.

1313
01:30:51.697 --> 01:30:52.698 line:83%
Right.

1314
01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:53.782 line:83%
Ming.

1315
01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:57.161 line:83%
Please don't ask who Ming is.

1316
01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:08.672 line:83%
Not bad, huh?

1317
01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:13.510 line:83%
Now we just gotta figure out how to get you out of here.

1318
01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:25.814 line:83%
Shall we?

1319
01:31:30.444 --> 01:31:31.653 line:83%
Now, that's cool.

1320
01:31:35.782 --> 01:31:39.494 line:83%
Welcome. May I offer you a piece of cake?

1321
01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:41.872 line:83%
No! No!

1322
01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:43.540 line:83%
No!

1323
01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.212 line:83%
No, thank you.

1324
01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:00.182 line:83%
Steady.

1325
01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.199 line:83%
I'd like to see your friend Ming do that!

1326
01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.957 line:83%
We got an issue here.

1327
01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:29.211 line:83%
Oh, thank you.

1328
01:32:31.838 --> 01:32:32.673 line:83%
Thank you.

1329
01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:45.310 line:83%
Brothers Kababik, I present Jurgen the Brutal.

1330
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:56.488 line:83%
At last,

1331
01:32:56.571 --> 01:33:00.075 line:83%
we meet on this historic day.

1332
01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:03.578 line:83%
Yes, it is so great to meet you.

1333
01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:07.916 line:83%
Your Honor, if that be the Falcon Jewel

1334
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.461 line:83%
upon your thick and meaty neck,

1335
01:33:12.045 --> 01:33:13.255 line:83%
perhaps we should...

1336
01:33:14.464 --> 01:33:15.549 line:83%
take it.

1337
01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:20.012 line:83%
Today we forge an unbreakable alliance.

1338
01:33:20.554 --> 01:33:22.556 line:83%
Your family will join me,

1339
01:33:23.015 --> 01:33:26.768 line:83%
and land by land, we'll take the world.

1340
01:33:27.894 --> 01:33:30.314 line:83%
So I ask, on this historic day,

1341
01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.524 line:83%
where is she?

1342
01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:37.029 line:83%
-Where's who?
-Who you talking about?

1343
01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:38.947 line:83%
Your sister.

1344
01:33:39.031 --> 01:33:40.741 line:83%
Soon to be my bride.

1345
01:33:44.161 --> 01:33:48.040 line:83%
You know what?
I think that there's been a misunderstanding.

1346
01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:51.001 line:83%
Where is your sister?

1347
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.423 line:83%
Which sister were we talking about?

1348
01:33:56.506 --> 01:33:59.343 line:83%
Debbie or... Brooke?

1349
01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:02.387 line:83%
Or Sierra?

1350
01:34:02.929 --> 01:34:06.183 line:83%
Where is your sister?

1351
01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:10.687 line:83%
She's getting ready, back at the hotel.

1352
01:34:10.771 --> 01:34:13.190 line:83%
She's just doing what brides do on their wedding day.

1353
01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:17.235 line:83%
Hanging with the girls, getting her hair done, mani-pedi.

1354
01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:22.240 line:83%
If you've come here without your sister...

1355
01:34:25.327 --> 01:34:27.454 line:83%
I just might have to cut off your heads.

1356
01:34:27.537 --> 01:34:29.748 line:83%
-Oh, no! No, no, no. Don't.
-Hey. Hey.

1357
01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:31.375 line:83%
-God, no.
-Hey, get off!

1358
01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:35.045 line:83%
-No. No.
-So I'll ask one last time:

1359
01:34:35.128 --> 01:34:38.382 line:83%
-Getting a mani-pedi!
-Where is your sister?

1360
01:34:38.465 --> 01:34:39.758 line:83%
I'm right here.

1361
01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:51.520 line:83%
Gwendolyn Hortencia Lewelda Kababik?

1362
01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:52.646 line:83%
Is that you?

1363
01:34:54.106 --> 01:34:55.273 line:83%
Yes.

1364
01:34:55.357 --> 01:34:56.525 line:83%
That is me.

1365
01:34:57.734 --> 01:34:59.152 line:83%
Now, please,

1366
01:34:59.236 --> 01:35:02.989 line:83%
O Brutal One, release my brothers.

1367
01:35:06.118 --> 01:35:08.453 line:83%
And is it your intention, on this day,

1368
01:35:08.537 --> 01:35:12.499 line:83%
at this hour, to wed Jurgen the Brutal of Zhatmire?

1369
01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:16.336 line:83%
Yep. That's my plan.

1370
01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:19.214 line:83%
And is it your intention to mother his children

1371
01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:22.342 line:83%
and forge in blood this union with your family?

1372
01:35:24.386 --> 01:35:25.470 line:83%
Yes.

1373
01:35:25.554 --> 01:35:27.597 line:83%
Gwendolyn Kababik...

1374
01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:29.599 line:83%
known throughout the world

1375
01:35:29.683 --> 01:35:32.436 line:83%
for your beauty and cunning.

1376
01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:35.981 line:83%
And now you're mine.

1377
01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:43.697 line:83%
May I hold the Falcon Jewel?

1378
01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:47.367 line:83%
Of course, my bride.

1379
01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:49.327 line:83%
Thank you.

1380
01:35:51.037 --> 01:35:52.038 line:83%
Get it.

1381
01:35:55.125 --> 01:35:56.918 line:83%
Jurgen the Brutal!

1382
01:35:57.002 --> 01:36:01.590 line:83%
The Brothers Kababik have been delayed in Gorek.

1383
01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.425 line:83%
These are impostors!

1384
01:36:03.925 --> 01:36:05.760 line:83%
-Impostors?
-Seize them!

1385
01:36:05.844 --> 01:36:07.721 line:83%
No, no, no. Oh, no. We can explain.

1386
01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:08.889 line:83%
Oh, no, no, no.

1387
01:36:08.972 --> 01:36:10.891 line:83%
I forgot to tell you one thing.

1388
01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:14.561 line:83%
I have a boyfriend.

1389
01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:28.283 line:83%
-Get back.
-Stay back.

1390
01:36:28.366 --> 01:36:29.367 line:83%
-Stay away.
-Get back!

1391
01:36:30.327 --> 01:36:31.578 line:83%
Get back!

1392
01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:54.851 line:83%
Get out of here! I will torch you, bitches.

1393
01:36:54.935 --> 01:36:57.062 line:83%
I will literally burn your face.

1394
01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:21.378 line:83%
I'll meet the brothers in Gorek.

1395
01:37:21.461 --> 01:37:22.546 line:83%
Kill them all!

1396
01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:26.466 line:83%
Go get him!

1397
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:27.634 line:83%
Go get the jewel!

1398
01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:29.844 line:83%
Don't worry about us. Just go!

1399
01:37:31.972 --> 01:37:32.889 line:83%
Backpack.

1400
01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:38.853 line:83%
Get away! I know geometry.

1401
01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:42.065 line:83%
I'm not messing around, you guys. Get away!

1402
01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:44.317 line:83%
Fridge, we're gonna die!

1403
01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:57.372 line:83%
Anybody wanna dance with the bride?

1404
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.314 line:83%
You want a piece?

1405
01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:06.775 line:83%
Come on!

1406
01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:14.115 line:83%
Nunchucks.

1407
01:39:26.336 --> 01:39:27.462 line:83%
Awesome.

1408
01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:35.053 line:83%
We did it.

1409
01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:36.012 line:83%
Let's go!

1410
01:39:45.897 --> 01:39:47.732 line:83%
-Come on, come on!
-Hurry!

1411
01:40:09.337 --> 01:40:10.171 line:83%
Look!

1412
01:40:12.215 --> 01:40:13.925 line:83%
-Is that Spencer?
-Oh, my God.

1413
01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:05.810 line:83%
No!

1414
01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:12.734 line:83%
Spencer!

1415
01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:23.912 line:83%
Who are you?

1416
01:41:29.584 --> 01:41:31.711 line:83%
I'm Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

1417
01:41:57.028 --> 01:41:57.904 line:83%
Spencer!

1418
01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:03.827 line:83%
-He says to get on his back.
-Who, me?

1419
01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:14.295 line:83%
Oh, no!

1420
01:42:36.526 --> 01:42:38.528 line:83%
Oh, no. Milo!

1421
01:42:38.611 --> 01:42:39.946 line:83%
-Oh, my God.
-What's he doing?

1422
01:42:40.029 --> 01:42:41.114 line:83%
Wait.

1423
01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:43.616 line:83%
Milo!

1424
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:54.168 line:83%
Yeah, Milo!

1425
01:42:55.753 --> 01:42:57.088 line:83%
Go!

1426
01:42:59.674 --> 01:43:01.467 line:83%
We're coming, Spencer!

1427
01:43:05.346 --> 01:43:06.681 line:83%
"Show it to the sun."

1428
01:43:07.223 --> 01:43:08.641 line:83%
Grandpa, the jewel!

1429
01:43:08.725 --> 01:43:11.519 line:83%
You gotta show it to the sun! Get ready!

1430
01:43:18.318 --> 01:43:20.194 line:83%
Come on, Milo!

1431
01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:22.864 line:83%
-Go!
-Come on, come on!

1432
01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:38.838 line:83%
Yeah!

1433
01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.184 line:83%
-Call out its name.
-Call out its name.

1434
01:43:51.267 --> 01:43:52.852 line:83%
Call out its name!

1435
01:43:52.936 --> 01:43:55.688 line:83%
Jumanji!

1436
01:43:55.772 --> 01:43:58.942 line:83%
Jumanji!

1437
01:43:59.025 --> 01:44:00.026 line:83%
What'd they say?

1438
01:44:02.236 --> 01:44:03.529 line:83%
Jumanji?

1439
01:44:34.394 --> 01:44:35.436 line:83%
Yes!

1440
01:44:36.104 --> 01:44:37.397 line:83%
We won!

1441
01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.273 line:83%
-We did it!
-Hey.

1442
01:44:40.441 --> 01:44:42.568 line:83%
-Yes!
-Put me down.

1443
01:44:42.652 --> 01:44:44.362 line:83%
-Put me down, goddamn it. Stop it.
-Okay.

1444
01:44:44.445 --> 01:44:47.198 line:83%
Is this what you were looking for? This little thing?

1445
01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:48.908 line:83%
Grandpa, you guys were incredible.

1446
01:44:48.992 --> 01:44:52.620 line:83%
Yeah, that's the thing about Milo. He's got a lot of skills.

1447
01:44:52.704 --> 01:44:54.038 line:83%
Milo and Eddie.

1448
01:44:55.623 --> 01:44:56.791 line:83%
Milo and Eddie.

1449
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:06.092 line:83%
What are we doing here now?

1450
01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:18.563 line:83%
Well done, intrepid adventurers.

1451
01:45:18.646 --> 01:45:21.315 line:83%
You have saved Jumanji. Again.

1452
01:45:22.483 --> 01:45:27.155 line:83%
And now, with your permission, Dr. Bravestone,
I will take the jewel from here.

1453
01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:32.493 line:83%
I will protect it with my life and return it to the care
of the elder at the Avian Province.

1454
01:45:32.577 --> 01:45:34.787 line:83%
And so your work here is done.

1455
01:45:34.871 --> 01:45:38.750 line:83%
All of Jumanji thanks you. And, sadly, this is where we part.

1456
01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:41.586 line:83%
I don't know what's sad about it.
I'm ready to get the hell out of here.

1457
01:45:46.716 --> 01:45:47.592 line:83%
What?

1458
01:45:49.594 --> 01:45:50.428 line:83%
Really?

1459
01:45:53.765 --> 01:45:56.809 line:83%
-Hey, guys, you're not gonna believe this.
-What'd he say?

1460
01:45:58.269 --> 01:46:00.521 line:83%
-He says that he--
-He wants to stay.

1461
01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:05.026 line:83%
He says somebody's gotta stay and look after this place.

1462
01:46:06.569 --> 01:46:09.614 line:83%
And that he's 75 years old and he just learned how to fly.

1463
01:46:12.867 --> 01:46:15.328 line:83%
But he won't be able to get out.

1464
01:46:16.621 --> 01:46:17.622 line:83%
He knows.

1465
01:46:21.667 --> 01:46:23.586 line:83%
Oh, Milo.

1466
01:46:26.923 --> 01:46:29.050 line:83%
I feel like I just got you back.

1467
01:46:30.051 --> 01:46:31.761 line:83%
Now I'm losing you for good.

1468
01:46:34.097 --> 01:46:37.642 line:83%
"You're not losing me, buddy. I'll always be with you."

1469
01:46:44.107 --> 01:46:46.275 line:83%
Being your partner...

1470
01:46:46.359 --> 01:46:49.320 line:83%
is one of the best things I ever got to be.

1471
01:46:52.907 --> 01:46:54.158 line:83%
He says, "Thank you."

1472
01:46:54.242 --> 01:46:55.201 line:83%
No, no.

1473
01:46:56.202 --> 01:46:57.537 line:83%
Thank you, Milo.

1474
01:47:26.399 --> 01:47:27.483 line:83%
Yes!

1475
01:47:28.276 --> 01:47:30.111 line:83%
-Take care, Milo!
-Bye!

1476
01:47:30.194 --> 01:47:31.487 line:83%
-Go, Milo!
-So long, Milo!

1477
01:47:31.571 --> 01:47:33.322 line:83%
Bye-bye, Mr. Walker!

1478
01:47:36.576 --> 01:47:38.744 line:83%
That's my partner right there.

1479
01:47:44.584 --> 01:47:47.920 line:83%
Everybody should be so lucky to have a friend like Milo.

1480
01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:05.062 line:83%
Come on, Grandpa.

1481
01:48:05.563 --> 01:48:06.606 line:83%
Let's go home.

1482
01:48:11.152 --> 01:48:12.153 line:83%
Hey, guys.

1483
01:48:14.864 --> 01:48:16.073 line:83%
Thanks for coming to get me.

1484
01:48:21.913 --> 01:48:25.875 line:83%
You do it again, your ass is gonna be stuck here, Spencer!
Because I'm not coming back!

1485
01:48:49.232 --> 01:48:50.650 line:83%
Everybody okay?

1486
01:48:52.193 --> 01:48:53.819 line:83%
Yeah.

1487
01:48:53.903 --> 01:48:55.279 line:83%
Grandpa, you okay?

1488
01:48:57.031 --> 01:48:58.699 line:83%
Yeah, I'm good.

1489
01:49:00.701 --> 01:49:02.870 line:83%
Holy shit.

1490
01:49:16.592 --> 01:49:18.678 line:83%
Strike. Square one. Counterstrike.

1491
01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:22.515 line:83%
-The fat one on the bottom?
-The fat-- No, the fat one above the R.

1492
01:49:22.598 --> 01:49:23.808 line:83%
-Okay.
-Atop number two.

1493
01:49:23.891 --> 01:49:26.394 line:83%
-Yeah. Yeah.
-So strike, strike.

1494
01:49:26.477 --> 01:49:28.604 line:83%
-Yeah.
-Counterstrike.

1495
01:49:28.688 --> 01:49:31.440 line:83%
Then kick me. O.

1496
01:49:35.569 --> 01:49:36.946 line:83%
Let me tell you something.

1497
01:49:37.029 --> 01:49:40.283 line:83%
-Getting old--
-I know. Getting old sucks.

1498
01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:43.452 line:83%
Getting old...

1499
01:49:46.706 --> 01:49:48.165 line:83%
is a gift.

1500
01:49:50.543 --> 01:49:52.753 line:83%
I forget that sometimes.

1501
01:49:53.963 --> 01:49:55.172 line:83%
But it is.

1502
01:49:59.719 --> 01:50:02.013 line:83%
What more could a guy possibly want?

1503
01:50:08.227 --> 01:50:09.145 line:83%
Hey, guys.

1504
01:50:10.271 --> 01:50:11.689 line:83%
How was your day?

1505
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:13.566 line:83%
It was really great.

1506
01:50:14.775 --> 01:50:16.485 line:83%
Yeah.

1507
01:50:16.569 --> 01:50:19.363 line:83%
Spencer taught me how to play a video game.

1508
01:50:34.045 --> 01:50:35.379 line:83%
Oh, hell, no.

1509
01:50:47.183 --> 01:50:48.476 line:83%
You okay, Grandpa?

1510
01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:52.813 line:83%
Yeah.

1511
01:50:52.897 --> 01:50:54.732 line:83%
A lot of good memories here.

1512
01:51:06.619 --> 01:51:07.745 line:83%
Eddie.

1513
01:51:07.828 --> 01:51:09.580 line:83%
Eddie, is that you?

1514
01:51:09.663 --> 01:51:11.123 line:83%
Nora.

1515
01:51:11.207 --> 01:51:13.000 line:83%
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

1516
01:51:13.084 --> 01:51:14.001 line:83%
Hey, guys.

1517
01:51:14.085 --> 01:51:15.378 line:83%
-Hi.
-Hi.

1518
01:51:16.796 --> 01:51:18.255 line:83%
What's up, bro?

1519
01:51:18.839 --> 01:51:20.966 line:83%
So how's business?

1520
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:22.551 line:83%
Oh, you know how it is.

1521
01:51:22.635 --> 01:51:25.805 line:83%
My manager quit six months ago, moved to Philly.

1522
01:51:25.888 --> 01:51:28.516 line:83%
Place has been kind of a mess ever since.

1523
01:51:28.599 --> 01:51:32.186 line:83%
It's hard to find people who really know how to do this.

1524
01:51:32.269 --> 01:51:33.562 line:83%
Oh, well...

1525
01:51:34.563 --> 01:51:36.565 line:83%
I don't have to tell you this.

1526
01:51:40.027 --> 01:51:41.821 line:83%
So you need some help around here?

1527
01:51:43.364 --> 01:51:44.782 line:83%
You mean it?

1528
01:51:44.865 --> 01:51:46.951 line:83%
I mean, I--

1529
01:51:47.034 --> 01:51:48.494 line:83%
I'd be honored.

1530
01:51:48.911 --> 01:51:49.912 line:83%
Well...

1531
01:51:52.164 --> 01:51:53.791 line:83%
It's really good to see you, Eddie.

1532
01:51:55.251 --> 01:51:57.211 line:83%
Likewise.

1533
01:52:07.471 --> 01:52:09.974 line:83%
I'm... I'm gonna take this

1534
01:52:10.474 --> 01:52:13.853 line:83%
where I was going and...

1535
01:52:13.936 --> 01:52:15.229 line:83%
I'll be right back.

1536
01:52:15.312 --> 01:52:17.815 line:83%
You guys gotta come to New York too.

1537
01:52:17.898 --> 01:52:19.400 line:83%
Yeah, I can't wait.

1538
01:52:20.443 --> 01:52:22.194 line:83%
This team, forever.

1539
01:52:23.279 --> 01:52:24.447 line:83%
Forever.

1540
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:25.531 line:83%
Always.

1541
01:52:26.907 --> 01:52:30.411 line:83%
Always and forever?

1542
01:52:30.494 --> 01:52:33.497 line:83%
-Yeah, let's keep close though.
-Of course, yeah.

1543
01:52:33.581 --> 01:52:35.124 line:83%
One thing.

1544
01:52:35.207 --> 01:52:36.792 line:83%
Can we all agree?

1545
01:52:36.876 --> 01:52:38.711 line:83%
Let's never go back there.

1546
01:52:38.794 --> 01:52:40.421 line:83%
-I thought we already agreed on that.
-That's fine.

1547
01:53:21.295 --> 01:53:23.005 line:83%
Sorry, it's so late.

1548
01:53:23.088 --> 01:53:25.633 line:83%
Yeah, it's that time of year. Everyone's heaters are broken.

1549
01:53:25.716 --> 01:53:28.636 line:83%
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just glad you made it.

1550
01:53:28.719 --> 01:53:30.429 line:83%
The furnace is right over here.

1551
01:53:35.601 --> 01:53:37.770 line:83%
Is that an old video game console?

1552
01:53:40.022 --> 01:53:42.024 line:83%
Oh, yeah, probably.

1553
01:53:42.107 --> 01:53:43.984 line:83%
It belongs to my son.

1554
01:53:46.028 --> 01:53:47.655 line:83%
Yeah, I'm a big gamer.

1555
01:53:48.697 --> 01:53:50.407 line:83%
I've never seen anything like it.

1556
01:53:55.663 --> 01:53:57.581 line:83%
Well, it looks like it's broken.

1557
01:53:58.874 --> 01:54:00.876 line:83%
Maybe you shouldn't touch it.
