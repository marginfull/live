00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:22.125 line:83%
Like, it sounds like they hate each other,
but they just keep smiling

307
00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:24.833 line:83%
-while they're saying
all this real mean stuff.
-Yeah, that checks out. Mm.

308
00:13:24.916 --> 00:13:27.000 line:83%
-Yeah, that's 100%
how we do it in our family.
-Yeah.

309
00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:30.208 line:83%
So I'm gonna fill you in a little bit.

310
00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:31.708 line:83%
-Mama's judging the shit
out of everything.
-[Margot] Mm-hmm.

311
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:33.125 line:83%
[Neve] Gwynny's complaining
about her problems.

312
00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:35.416 line:83%
She thinks they're problems
but actually aren't problems.

313
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.500 line:83%
And Colton's already called Rebecca
"the wife" at least three times.

314
00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:41.750 line:83%
Wait, what is Pastor Jerry doing here?
Pastor Luther is marrying y'all.

315
00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:43.083 line:83%
-He's coming on Saturday.
-It's fine.

316
00:13:43.166 --> 00:13:44.833 line:83%
I think Mom invited Pastor Jerry.
It's no big deal.

317
00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:48.000 line:83%
He hit on you during
our premarital counseling session.

318
00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:49.333 line:83%
-Ugh.
-He's a handsy Colonel Sanders,

319
00:13:49.416 --> 00:13:51.500 line:83%
-and I'm also pregnant, by the way.
-What?

320
00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:54.041 line:83%
Oh, my God, congratulations!

321
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.375 line:83%
[hushed] Thank you.
I don't want anyone to know.

322
00:13:56.458 --> 00:13:58.375 line:83%
-I cannot be having a premarital baby
in my stomach...
-Oh.

323
00:13:58.458 --> 00:14:00.125 line:83%
-...if you know what I mean.
-Yes, yes, yes.

324
00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:01.541 line:83%
But you're gonna be the cutest mom ever.

325
00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.291 line:83%
-[Neve laughs]
-And I'm having a really hard time
keeping quiet

326
00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.416 line:83%
because I'm very, very excited
for both of y'all.

327
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.666 line:83%
Yeah, I-I think we should just tell 'em.
You know, I think they'd be happy.

328
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.250 line:83%
[both laughing]

329
00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:13.791 line:83%
-No. No.
-No. No, sweetie.

330
00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:15.458 line:83%
-Hey.
-Hey.

331
00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:16.708 line:83%
[Margot] Hi, Mama.

332
00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:18.541 line:83%
Well, aren't we looking Hollywood?

333
00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:20.750 line:83%
Oh, I'm... wearing a blazer
and some shorts.

334
00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:23.458 line:83%
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-But, yeah, th-thank you.

335
00:14:23.541 --> 00:14:28.375 line:83%
And what an interesting choice
to get married here on Palmetto Island.

336
00:14:28.458 --> 00:14:30.708 line:83%
Yeah. Neve and I loved
our summers here with Nana.

337
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.875 line:83%
You two girls and my mother,

338
00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.125 line:83%
-just thick as thieves.
-That's right.

339
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.166 line:83%
Probably 'cause she gave you
all that candy.

340
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.541 line:83%
Or the unconditional love
and support we needed.

341
00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:41.500 line:83%
But you know what? It's not important.
How are you, Gwynny?

342
00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:44.041 line:83%
I'm okay. I mean, you know
I've been through a lot lately.

343
00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:46.000 line:83%
I-I got a lot going on at the house.

344
00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:48.583 line:83%
You know, I wanted a new birdbath,
and they brought this birdbath,

345
00:14:48.666 --> 00:14:50.875 line:83%
and then they put a big border around it,
looks like a grave.

346
00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.208 line:83%
-[Neve gasps] Wow.
-Looks like somebody's buried out there.

347
00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:55.750 line:83%
And I've had to get off of sugar...
for this wedding.

348
00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:57.958 line:83%
I've been on a cleanse for three days.

349
00:14:58.041 --> 00:14:59.916 line:83%
I'm weak as water.

350
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.083 line:83%
I can't even make a fist.

351
00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:05.000 line:83%
It'll be fine. I'll be okay.
I'll push through for you.

352
00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:06.375 line:83%
[Neve] Thank you, Gwynny.

353
00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:08.458 line:83%
Well, you remember Pastor Jerry.

354
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:10.375 line:83%
[Neve chuckles]

355
00:15:10.458 --> 00:15:12.416 line:83%
The wife was so happy to see you,
Pastor Jerry.

356
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.791 line:83%
Well, I'm blessed to see all of you.

357
00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:18.125 line:83%
And you, too, Margot.

358
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:20.833 line:83%
-Aw.
-Thank you, I feel very blessed
without the touching.

359
00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:22.250 line:83%
Please don't touch me. Thanks.

360
00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:24.541 line:83%
Wait, is that your kid in the tree?

361
00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:27.458 line:83%
Yeah. Yeah, Dawson Scott. There he is.

362
00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:29.166 line:83%
Hi, Aunt Margot.

363
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.708 line:83%
[Colton] Do kids
not climb trees in California?

364
00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:33.541 line:83%
Probably... probably too busy smoking 'em.

365
00:15:33.625 --> 00:15:34.875 line:83%
[laughter]

366
00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.458 line:83%
[inhaling]

367
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:37.666 line:83%
Are you smoking?

368
00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:40.625 line:83%
No.

369
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.208 line:83%
[quietly] Right.

370
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:43.625 line:83%
[excited chattering nearby]

371
00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:46.125 line:83%
[chanting] Shot! Shot!
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

372
00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:48.458 line:83%
Okay, well, I'm gonna go check us in.

373
00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:50.625 line:83%
-I'm gonna go get us checked in.
-Okay.

-Oh. After you.

377
00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:14.166 line:83%
No, please. You go first.

378
00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:19.000 line:83%
Hi there.
I'm checking into the bridal suite.

379
00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:20.166 line:83%
My name is Margot Buckley.

380
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.875 line:83%
My sister is Neve Buckley,
and she's getting married this weekend.

381
00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.041 line:83%
Oh, oh, h-hold on, hold on.
I-I think there might be a little mistake.

382
00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:27.625 line:83%
Uh, 'cause my daughter is getting married.

383
00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:29.000 line:83%
Jenni Caldwell.

384
00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.583 line:83%
Uh, i-it's booked.
We-we booked the weekend.

385
00:16:30.666 --> 00:16:34.666 line:83%
Well, now, I only have Neve Buckley
written down here.

386
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.916 line:83%
No, that's not possible.
That's literally impossible.

387
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.166 line:83%
I'm looking at the book.

388
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.583 line:83%
-Okay, well, look at the book again.
-[Margot] Yeah.

389
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.750 line:83%
I spoke to your mother Scarlett.
She booked it.

390
00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:42.958 line:83%
In fact, bring her out.

391
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:44.458 line:83%
Scarlett! Get out here!

392
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:45.750 line:83%
Scarlett, it's Jim!

393
00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.750 line:83%
Oh, she passed last summer.

394
00:16:47.833 --> 00:16:49.375 line:83%
[Margot] Oh.

395
00:16:49.458 --> 00:16:50.791 line:83%
-That's terrible. I'm sorry.
-Sorry for your loss.

396
00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:53.208 line:83%
Thank you. Uh, she meant
so much to this place...

397
00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:55.416 line:83%
That being said. [chuckles]

398
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.250 line:83%
I, uh, I spoke with her last summer.

399
00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:58.541 line:83%
Oh, when?

400
00:16:58.625 --> 00:17:00.333 line:83%
Uh, June 15th.

401
00:17:00.416 --> 00:17:03.000 line:83%
That is the day that she died.

402
00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:04.916 line:83%
Here, give me the book.

403
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.375 line:83%
What are you doing?

404
00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:08.458 line:83%
What are...
Are you letting him touch the book?

405
00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:10.541 line:83%
He can't do that to the book.

406
00:17:10.625 --> 00:17:12.625 line:83%
What is...

It's the last thing

What is this David Copperfield shit?

413
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.708 line:83%
Oh, no.

414
00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:33.750 line:83%
We've double-booked your weddings.

415
00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:35.083 line:83%
-What?
-What?

416
00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:36.625 line:83%
Uh, I'm sure we can figure this out.

417
00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:37.958 line:83%
There's no way to figure it out.

418
00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:39.333 line:83%
We're on a tiny island.
There's nowhere else to stay.

419
00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:41.208 line:83%
And there's nowhere to get married
except the dock.

420
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:44.375 line:83%
There's nowhere else to have the reception
or the rehearsal dinner but the farmhouse.

421
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:45.583 line:83%
And you only have one bridal suite.

422
00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:47.875 line:83%
I understand that this is very stressful.

423
00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.250 line:83%
Uh, I've got a lot of stuff going on, too.

424
00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:52.250 line:83%
-I don't give a shit.
-Yeah, I don't have the bandwidth

425
00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:54.458 line:83%
for anything but this
"double-booked" situation.

426
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:55.875 line:83%
What, you double-booked?

427
00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.583 line:83%
What do you mean you double-booked?

428
00:17:57.666 --> 00:18:01.208 line:83%
We booked your wedding and his
daughter's wedding on the same weekend.

429
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:03.333 line:83%
Oh, Jesus.

430
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.666 line:83%
Well, of course this would happen here.

431
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.625 line:83%
It's Nana's ghost haunting us. [laughing]

432
00:18:08.708 --> 00:18:10.416 line:83%
Well, I've got the situation
under control.

433
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.291 line:83%
Doesn't seem like it.

434
00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:14.666 line:83%
Okay, well, why don't you guys go get
one of the specialty welcome cocktails,

435
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.541 line:83%
and I'll just iron out this little snafu.

436
00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:19.083 line:83%
-Margot's so good at this stuff,
so I'm sure she'll have it all fixed up.
-Okay. Hold our... hold our luggage.

437
00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:20.625 line:83%
[mouthing]

438
00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:26.416 line:83%
Wait a second.
Whose credit card's on file?

439
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.166 line:83%
Wait, wh-what does that
have to do with anything?

440
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.000 line:83%
We only have yours, ma'am.

441
00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:31.666 line:83%
-Yes, of course.
-O-Okay.

442
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.291 line:83%
But Scarlett said she didn't need
to see my credit card

443
00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:34.541 line:83%
'cause I'm a friend of the family.

444
00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:37.583 line:83%
And then my daughter's wedding planner,
who is a drunk child,

445
00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:38.875 line:83%
took over the planning.

446
00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:40.666 line:83%
Shh. Whose credit card
do you have on file?

447
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.583 line:83%
-Let me finish explaining.
-Yours.

448
00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:44.666 line:83%
-So the place is legally...
-Yours.

449
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:45.750 line:83%
So, whose credit card's on file?

450
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:47.208 line:83%
You know damn well
whose credit card he has on file.

451
00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:48.291 line:83%
Stop saying "credit card."

452
00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:49.625 line:83%
Credit card, credit card, credit card.

453
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:50.958 line:83%
Let's just all calm down.

454
00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:52.291 line:83%
-Oh, I'm clam.
-Oh, I'm super calm.

455
00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:54.541 line:83%
-[scoffs] You don't seem calm.
-I'm dead calm.

456
00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:55.666 line:83%
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

457
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.958 line:83%
But let's get something straight:

458
00:18:57.041 --> 00:18:58.750 line:83%
My sweet little pumpkin's
gonna have her special day,

459
00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:00.000 line:83%
and no one's getting in the way of that.

460
00:19:00.083 --> 00:19:03.125 line:83%
Not you, not some dead lady
who can't keep her shit together.

461
00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:04.750 line:83%
No one. And come Saturday,

462
00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:07.666 line:83%
if I look out on that dock
and that bride's not my baby girl,

463
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.916 line:83%
that bride's going in the fucking lake!

464
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.458 line:83%
Okay?

465
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:13.916 line:83%
Splish-splash, bitch taking a bath.

466
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.333 line:83%
Okay, you listen to me.

467
00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:18.291 line:83%
My sister is a literal angel
who walks on this Earth.

468
00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:19.791 line:83%
-Oh.
-And I'm gonna watch that dock

469
00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:23.000 line:83%
night and day and make sure
she gets married there.

470
00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:24.708 line:83%
-And if you try to fuck with me...
-Mm-hmm.

471
00:19:24.791 --> 00:19:27.291 line:83%
-...I'm gonna bust your face.
-Mm.

472
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.375 line:83%
Because I've been doing Pilates
for over 20 years now,

473
00:19:29.458 --> 00:19:32.208 line:83%
-and my core is a solid-ass rock.
-Oh, really?

474
00:19:32.291 --> 00:19:33.291 line:83%
Doesn't look like a rock.

475
00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:35.125 line:83%
Try me. You're gonna break
your fucking hand,

476
00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:37.083 line:83%
and I'm gonna kick your ass,
and it's gonna be embarrassing.

477
00:19:37.166 --> 00:19:38.708 line:83%
-[Jim scoffs]
-'Cause you're big and I'm little.

478
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:39.833 line:83%
Okay, you're gonna love it in the lake.

479
00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:42.083 line:83%
You're gonna become a local legend
like the Loch Ness Monster.

[Jim sighs]

483
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:51.875 line:83%
When you end up in the lake,
it's gonna wash off your terrible dye job.

484
00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.041 line:83%
[scoffs] I don't dye my hair.

485
00:19:54.125 --> 00:19:55.250 line:83%
Nice try.

486
00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:56.416 line:83%
I don't.

487
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.083 line:83%
I know.

488
00:19:58.166 --> 00:20:01.208 line:83%
Listen to me. I have legally,
officially booked this place,

489
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:04.958 line:83%
so you and your daughter
and all of her friends can go take a walk.

490
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:06.291 line:83%
Now, key me.

491
00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:08.333 line:83%
Welcome to the Palmetto House.

492
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.666 line:83%
Thank you. You've been a delight.

493
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.958 line:83%
You said you handled it!

494
00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:13.500 line:83%
Why didn't you just give them
your credit card?!

495
00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:16.750 line:83%
Well, you said it was reserved!
I didn't know I had to double-check!

496
00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:18.458 line:83%
So, you never even called this place?

497
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:21.458 line:83%
I have social anxiety,
so I just sent emails.

498
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:23.708 line:83%
You get anxiety from dialing a phone?

499
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:26.166 line:83%
I can do anything
that doesn't require a phone call!

500
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.791 line:83%
Where's all the money
we Venmo'd you for this place?

501
00:20:28.875 --> 00:20:31.625 line:83%
I have it with me on my phone!

502
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:34.291 line:83%
I'm sorry! What else do you want?!

503
00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.541 line:83%
I don't know,
aren't you the wedding planner?

504

[bridesmaids gasping]

505
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.500 line:83%
-Yeah, and she just apologized.
-[Jim] I'm sorry, I'm just...

506
00:20:38.583 --> 00:20:42.416 line:83%
That sister of the bride,
she got me... really riled up.

507
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.083 line:83%
That lady, I mean, she got under my skin.

508
00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:45.625 line:83%
Don't call her "lady."

509
00:20:45.708 --> 00:20:47.291 line:83%
Why not? She is a lady.

510
00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:49.333 line:83%
Yeah, but men only use the term "lady"
when they're mad at a woman.

511
00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.500 line:83%
It's super sexist.

512
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:51.583 line:83%
-Mm-hmm.
-You're a sexist.

513
00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:52.833 line:83%
What? No.

514
00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:54.208 line:83%
L-Lady's an honorific.

515
00:20:54.291 --> 00:20:56.291 line:83%
Not when you're like,
"that lady" with a sexist tone.

516
00:20:56.375 --> 00:20:58.458 line:83%
[Jim] Okay, well, that woman

517
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:00.416 line:83%
is a real skanky bitch.

-Oh, my God!

519

-Oh, yeah!
-Dad, cut it with the "lady" shit!

520
00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:05.666 line:83%
Okay? Why can't you just drop it?

521
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.166 line:83%
Sounds like you don't want me around.
Is that right?

522
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.750 line:83%
-No, not really.
-Guess what, I'm out of here.

523
00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:09.958 line:83%
-'Kay, bye.
-See ya, bye.

524
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:11.541 line:83%
-See ya, bye!
-Bye!

525
00:21:12.833 --> 00:21:14.750 line:83%
Can you believe that?

526
00:21:14.833 --> 00:21:16.458 line:83%
He, like, is totally inappropriate,
and then he just, like,

527
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:20.125 line:83%
comes back and he apologizes
and expects me to just, like, dissolve...

528
00:21:20.208 --> 00:21:21.333 line:83%
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

529
00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:22.958 line:83%
-I love you so much.
-[crying] I'm sorry.

530
00:21:23.041 --> 00:21:24.291 line:83%
I love you, too.

531
00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:25.791 line:83%
It's just that I want your wedding
to be perfect,

532
00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:27.916 line:83%
-and it's freaking me out.
-I'm freaking out, too,

533
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.875 line:83%
and you freaking out
doesn't help me not freak out,

534
00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:31.041 line:83%
and do you get that?

535
00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:33.375 line:83%
-I hear your truth.
-And I hear your truth.

536
00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:37.875 line:83%
This has been an emotional roller coaster.

-Don't feel terrible.

-[Neve] I feel guilty.
-[Margot] Don't feel guilty.

-Are we bad people for kicking them out?
-We are not kicking them out.

541
00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:49.291 line:83%
-Well, we kind of are.
-They didn't make a proper reservation.

542
00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:51.291 line:83%
I mean, we are kind of
kicking them out, though.

543
00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:52.791 line:83%
I have done three separate site visits.

544
00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:54.625 line:83%
And meanwhile,
their wedding planner hasn't done one.

545
00:21:54.708 --> 00:21:56.250 line:83%
-She hasn't been here once.
-Okay, that's true.

546
00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:58.208 line:83%
Listen, you're gonna have
the greatest weekend of your lives.

547
00:21:58.291 --> 00:21:59.666 line:83%
I want you to focus on that.

No, you're not a shitty person.

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:07.958 line:83%
We're just doing a shitty thing.

552
00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:13.875 line:83%
Oh, no, you can, uh,
just put it on my tab.

553
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.250 line:83%
You don't have to do that.

554
00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:17.166 line:83%
Accept it as an apology...

555
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.375 line:83%
for calling you the Loch Ness Monster.

556
00:22:19.458 --> 00:22:21.000 line:83%
[sighs] Well, thank you.

And-and you know what?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.875 line:83%
I want to apologize for suggesting
that you dye your hair.

559
00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:28.291 line:83%
Because clearly you don't.

560
00:22:31.875 --> 00:22:33.583 line:83%
So, where are you guys gonna go?

561
00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:37.291 line:83%
There's a Wet 'N Wild Water Park,
uh, and a...

a Super 8 nearby,
about 200 miles from here,

-Uh-huh.
-So...

565
00:22:43.958 --> 00:22:46.291 line:83%
We're hoping that will all work out.

566
00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:48.833 line:83%
-Hmm.
-Uh, I also baked
my daughter's wedding cake.

567
00:22:48.916 --> 00:22:50.333 line:83%
You baked it?

568
00:22:50.416 --> 00:22:53.083 line:83%
I don't know how I'm gonna get it
out there, but we'll make do.

569
00:22:53.166 --> 00:22:54.375 line:83%
That'll be part of the fun,
part of the adventure.

570
00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:56.458 line:83%
Hmm.

571
00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:57.625 line:83%
So, why the Palmetto?

572
00:22:57.708 --> 00:22:59.625 line:83%
My grandmother used to have
a house on the island,

573
00:22:59.708 --> 00:23:02.416 line:83%
and my sister and I would come
every summer to visit her.

574
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.833 line:83%
So we have all these great memories here.
How about you?

575
00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:06.208 line:83%
My wife and I got married here.

Oh. Well, that's...

577
00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:10.166 line:83%
Which one is she?
I'll make sure and avoid her,

578
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.375 line:83%
'cause I'm sure she's lovely,
and then I'm gonna feel guilty.

579
00:23:12.458 --> 00:23:14.083 line:83%
-Oh, sh-she's not here.
-Where is she?

580
00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:15.791 line:83%
[singsongy] She's dead.

581
00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:19.541 line:83%
That's a weird way to say that.

582
00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:20.791 line:83%
She's dead.

583
00:23:20.875 --> 00:23:22.416 line:83%
[sighs] He married his dead wife here.

584
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.416 line:83%
[gasps] Oh.

585
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.333 line:83%
And he's so into his daughter that
he baked her fucking wedding cake.

586
00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:29.208 line:83%
-No. No, no, no, no, no.
-[Dixon sighs]

587

I think you're right.
I think we're gonna have to let them stay.

588
00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:33.916 line:83%
Okay.

589
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000 line:83%
[Margot] Excuse me.

590
00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:36.625 line:83%
Yes?

591
00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.666 line:83%
If you're willing to be reasonable
and accommodating,

592

we're willing to split the venue.

Oh, my God, that's incredible.

594
00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:44.416 line:83%
Uh, I'm so sorry.
I don't know if that would be possible.

595
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.083 line:83%
My inn is not large enough
to accommodate everyone here.

596
00:23:47.166 --> 00:23:49.750 line:83%
Whatever we say in front of you, Leslie,
will be our legal negotiated agreement.

597
00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:52.291 line:83%
Negotiation on, Leslie.
You're our legal mediator.

598
00:23:52.375 --> 00:23:53.458 line:83%
I don't even know what that is.

599
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:55.375 line:83%
-Start writing. Yeah.
-Figure it out.

600
00:23:55.458 --> 00:23:57.583 line:83%
Rehearsal dinner. You take outside,
and we'll take the farmhouse.

601
00:23:57.666 --> 00:23:59.416 line:83%
-Ceremony? We need the dock.
-Oh, we're gonna need the dock.

602
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.541 line:83%
Well, okay,
we're willing to split the dock.

603
00:24:01.625 --> 00:24:03.625 line:83%
It-it's too tiny and narrow.
I don't think we can split it.

604
00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:05.750 line:83%
-He's correct about that.
-Maybe we could split it by time.

605
