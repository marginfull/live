00:00:38.456 --> 00:00:43.627 line:82%
A MATCH MADE BY GOD

2
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.857 line:82%
Just a minute, I'll be back.

3
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.327 line:82%
Yesterday, I saw her for the first time,

4
00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:47.830 line:82%
and fell in love instantly.

5
00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:48.998 line:82%
Hey, Taani!

6
00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:56.547 line:82%
Taani, look, your trousseau is here!

7
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.675 line:82%
Nobody sees my trousseau before I do!

8
00:05:02.678 --> 00:05:03.595 line:82%
Wait!

9
00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:18.110 line:82%
Taani, my child, what about
the henna application?

10
00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.113 line:82%
Dad, today is my wedding day.
No time tables, please.

11
00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.449 line:82%
And if you're such a rush,
you get henna applied on your hands.

12
00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:24.658 line:82%
She's unbelievable.

13
00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.452 line:82%
Did you see that, Surinder?

14
00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:29.038 line:82%
I have disciplined many kids in my life,

15
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:31.373 line:82%
but I couldn't discipline my own child.

16
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.126 line:82%
The princess has even chosen
her own Prince Charming.

17
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.335 line:82%
It's a love marriage.

18
00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.879 line:82%
It's fashionable these days.

19
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.298 line:82%
Taani, come here for a second.

20
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.595 line:82%
Guess who this is.

21
00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:50.601 line:82%
This is Surinder,
my most favorite student.

22
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.062 line:82%
Remember? I used to tell you about him.

23
00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:58.525 line:82%
Yes.

24
00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:00.360 line:82%
You have no idea, mister,

25
00:06:00.444 --> 00:06:03.405 line:82%
how much I've had to go through
because of you!

26
00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:05.699 line:82%
Because of me?

27
00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:09.203 line:82%
Yes. Throughout school and college,
I've only heard one thing.

28
00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.537 line:82%
Why don't you get marks like Surinder?

29
00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:12.206 line:82%
Learn how to respect elders like Surinder.

30
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.792 line:82%
Surinder did this, Surinder did that.

31
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.878 line:82%
And he even wanted to get us married.

32
00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.588 line:82%
No, no.

33
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.423 line:82%
What no, no? I am telling you.

34
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.008 line:82%
He told me very seriously

35
00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:25.469 line:82%
that only a very fortunate girl
can get a guy like Surinder.

36
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.223 line:82%
You don't know, but he loves you
more than he loves me.

37
00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:31.225 line:82%
Are you going to stop talking or what?

38
00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:32.893 line:82%
-Taani, come here.
-I am coming.

39
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.502 line:82%
Yes, it's true, I fell in love with her
the moment I saw her.

40
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:03.799 line:82%
Her beautiful face, her joyous dance,
her unhesitant laughter,

41
00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:07.886 line:82%
I thought I was seeing a girl
for the first time.

42
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.931 line:82%
It was a strange feeling.

43
00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:14.434 line:82%
I was happy and in pain
at the same time.

44
00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:40.586 line:82%
What happened?

45
00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.880 line:82%
The bus carrying the groom
and his family has met with an accident.

46
00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.298 line:82%
They're saying nobody survived.

47
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.508 line:82%
Please come, everyone.

48
00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:49.595 line:82%
Get a car fast!

49
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.613 line:82%
It was a massive heart attack.

50
00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:11.200 line:82%
We have done our best.

51
00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.826 line:82%
The rest is in God's hands.

52
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.913 line:82%
Who is Surinder?

53
00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:23.003 line:82%
Look, son, I have pampered Taani a lot.

54
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:25.505 line:82%
She is a child.

55
00:08:26.632 --> 00:08:27.883 line:82%
Very fragile.

56
00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:32.012 line:82%
She'll break under these circumstances.

57
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.182 line:82%
If you think it's right,

58
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.770 line:82%
then please marry Taani.

59
00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:49.029 line:82%
With you by her side, I can die in peace.

60
00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:54.701 line:82%
I don't have a lot of time, son.

61
00:08:57.496 --> 00:09:00.958 line:82%
If you say yes, I'll speak to Taani.

62
00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:19.893 line:82%
I know this is not the right time
to talk to you about this.

63
00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.521 line:82%
But what do I do?

64
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.901 line:82%
God has designed it to be this way.

65
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:34.408 line:82%
I have never forced you for anything.

66
00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:38.161 line:82%
And I won't force you today either.

67
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.541 line:82%
But, before I leave,

68
00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.418 line:82%
I'll give you a bit of advice.

69
00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:50.507 line:82%
In life, we choose some relationships

70
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.179 line:82%
and some relationships God chooses for us.

71
00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:02.602 line:82%
Just assume that God has chosen
Surinder for you.

72
00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:08.275 line:82%
The rest is up to you.

73
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:15.198 line:82%
But if I leave you alone like this,

74
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:19.745 line:82%
I won't die peacefully, sweet one.

75
00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:23.749 line:82%
I won't be able to rest in peace.

76
00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:27.252 line:82%
I won't ever rest in peace.

77
00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:38.555 line:82%
I'll do whatever you say, father.

78
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.225 line:82%
Bless you my child, bless you.

79
00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:57.282 line:82%
Long life and happiness, my children.

80
00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:28.915 line:82%
I will always sleep
in the attic upstairs.

81
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:34.629 line:82%
This room and cupboard
is all yours.

82
00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.885 line:82%
And if you need anything,
please let me know.

83
00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.609 line:82%
There was a delay in the meter delivery.

84
00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.071 line:82%
It has arrived now.
I have checked the inventory myself.

85
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:29.656 line:82%
Yes, within 48 hours.

86
00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:35.412 line:82%
Thank you.

87
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:40.375 line:82%
Punjab Power at your service.
Lighting up your life.

88
00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.547 line:82%
So, Surinder!

89
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.841 line:82%
What is this I'm hearing?

90
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.217 line:82%
Nothing.

91
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.721 line:82%
So Suri, you didn't come
to office for two days.

92
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.013 line:82%
Is everything all right, my friend?

93
00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:56.391 line:82%
Yes! Everything is fine.

94
00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.018 line:82%
Then why didn't you come to office?

95
00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:04.566 line:82%
Actually, I had to attend
someone's wedding.

96
00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:08.695 line:82%
Someone's wedding or your own?

97
00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.073 line:82%
No, nothing like that.

98
00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.034 line:82%
Do you think you can hide it from us?

99
00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.662 line:82%
You turned out to be so covert!

100
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.372 line:82%
You kept such a big secret from us.

101
00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:20.540 line:82%
Listen to me.

102
00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.295 line:82%
So, when do we get to meet your wife?

103
00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:26.713 line:82%
Come on, not like this.

104
00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.424 line:82%
Surinder is our dear buddy,
he will throw us a party.

105
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.720 line:82%
There's a party at Surinder's
tonight at 8!

106
00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.222 line:82%
Come on, not like this.

107
00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.975 line:82%
No, Khanna, not today, not today.

108
00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:12.258 line:82%
Surinder, open the door!

109
00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.053 line:82%
Why are you hiding inside?

110
00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:21.309 line:82%
Are you ashamed to see Bobby Khosla
in the eye?

111
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.315 line:82%
I say, open the door.

112
00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.194 line:82%
I don't want see you either.

113
00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.489 line:82%
I just came by to tell you
that we're no longer friends!

114
00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.617 line:82%
I don't need a friend like you.

115
00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:45.041 line:82%
The one person who did everything
together with you

116
00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.419 line:82%
hears about your wedding
from neighbors.

117
00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.465 line:82%
Is this the value of Bobby Khosla
in your life?

118
00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.134 line:82%
What a shame!

119
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.220 line:82%
Look, I know everything.

120
00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.640 line:82%
I know you are inside,
you left office an hour back.

121
00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.351 line:82%
I know everything, Suri.

122
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.602 line:82%
Bobby?

123
00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.321 line:82%
Hey, Bobby.

124
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.447 line:82%
Bobby is dead to you!

125
00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:21.870 line:82%
How can Bobby die
when Suri is still alive?

126
00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.373 line:82%
Come in, I'll explain everything.

127
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.633 line:82%
So, where is she?

128
00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:38.887 line:82%
Downstairs, in my room.

129
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.099 line:82%
And you sleep here?

130
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:46.477 line:82%
Yes.

131
00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:53.318 line:82%
And now what?

132
00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:57.530 line:82%
Whatever God decides.

133
00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.411 line:82%
Here come the caretakers
of Punjab Power.

134
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:07.081 line:82%
Always late to work but always on time
for free food and booze.

135
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.586 line:82%
You entertain them for a bit.
I'll check on Taani.

136
00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.720 line:82%
Don't worry, it will all be okay.

137
00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:26.100 line:82%
What's the rush?
Is your mother dead? Punks!

138
00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:41.824 line:82%
Some friends from office have come home.

139
00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:47.372 line:82%
They found out about the wedding
and invited themselves over.

140
00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:50.124 line:82%
I tried my best to dissuade them.

141
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:57.548 line:82%
I just have a small request.

142
00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:02.136 line:82%
Could you come out and meet them
for two minutes?

143
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:14.107 line:82%
You don't worry about it.

144
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.693 line:82%
I'll tell them you're unwell.

145
00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:17.860 line:82%
I'll manage.

146
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:42.260 line:82%
Hey, Sahni! Where is your wife?

147
00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.595 line:82%
We are all so eager to meet her.

148
00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:48.850 line:82%
He won't let us meet her so early.

149
00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.601 line:82%
He must be hiding her somewhere.

150
00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:56.274 line:82%
She is not feeling too well.
It was a long journey.

151
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:58.609 line:82%
Let me go get her.

152
00:21:58.693 --> 00:21:59.819 line:82%
Mrs. Surinder!

153
00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:04.073 line:82%
Hey, Chaddha!
You have still not had a drink with me.

154
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:07.326 line:82%
Okay, then, let's have a drink
and then go get Suri's wife.

155
00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.579 line:82%
Okay, Surinder , we'll take your leave.

156
00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:12.165 line:82%
We'll meet your wife some other time.

157
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:17.754 line:82%
Not a big deal.

158
00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:19.380 line:82%
No, she actually wanted to meet
all of you.

159
00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:12.493 line:82%
I wanted to talk to you.
Could you step outside for a minute?

160
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.496 line:82%
Yes.

161
00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:50.364 line:82%
I'm sorry for the way
I behaved today.

162
00:24:52.408 --> 00:24:54.327 line:82%
I married you willingly.

163
00:24:55.203 --> 00:24:58.497 line:82%
I have no right
to take my frustration out on you.

164
00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:05.254 line:82%
I promise to be a good wife.

165
00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:10.259 line:82%
Just be a bit patient with me.

166
00:25:12.762 --> 00:25:14.055 line:82%
The thing is,

167
00:25:15.223 --> 00:25:18.351 line:82%
I have to kill the old Taani
and become a new one.

168
00:25:20.353 --> 00:25:21.729 line:82%
That might take some time.

169
00:25:32.365 --> 00:25:33.908 line:82%
There's one more thing.

170
00:25:38.246 --> 00:25:39.914 line:82%
I will never be able to
fall in love with you.

171
00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:45.503 line:82%
There is no love left
to give anyone.

172
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.134 line:82%
I don't know
if it's possible for you

173
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:55.805 line:82%
to be in a loveless marriage.

174
00:25:58.349 --> 00:26:03.896 line:82%
If it's not, then I don't want to
be a burden.

175
00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:11.779 line:82%
I don't know what love is, Taani.

176
00:26:13.614 --> 00:26:17.034 line:82%
I wasn't lucky enough
to fall in love with a woman.

177
00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:21.330 line:82%
Actually, I don't even know
any women.

178
00:26:22.164 --> 00:26:23.582 line:82%
Falling in love with a woman
is unimaginable.

179
00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:29.130 line:82%
Today, the way you kept my dignity
in front of my friends,

180
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:32.049 line:82%
that is love for me.

181
00:26:35.303 --> 00:26:38.597 line:82%
I'm not used to any more love than this.

182
00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:41.851 line:82%
I don't need it either.

183
00:26:46.814 --> 00:26:51.444 line:82%
You are very lucky that
you have never been in love.

184
00:26:55.197 --> 00:27:00.161 line:82%
There is nothing more painful
than love.

185
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:05.875 line:82%
Okay, then.

186
00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:22.892 line:82%
Now I understand why I've been in pain
for the past two days.

187
00:27:25.478 --> 00:27:29.774 line:82%
I fell in love the first time I saw you.

188
00:29:22.136 --> 00:29:25.723 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow

189
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:36.442 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow

190
00:29:38.402 --> 00:29:40.779 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow, the winds blow

191
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.199 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow, the healing glow

192
00:29:43.908 --> 00:29:47.369 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
They bless us

193
00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:51.457 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
Is the rise of the moon

194
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.126 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
Lift the veil maroon

195
00:29:54.502 --> 00:29:57.671 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
We get high and we swoon

196
00:29:59.089 --> 00:30:01.342 line:82%
Take it slow now, let it sink

197
00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:04.136 line:82%
Take a breath
Step back from the brink

198
00:30:04.512 --> 00:30:06.889 line:82%
Toss your cares away
With a wink

199
00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:10.100 line:82%
'Cause life goes by
In a blink

200
00:30:10.184 --> 00:30:12.728 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
Love will flow

201
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:14.980 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
Love will flow

202
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:18.150 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
Love will flow

203
00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:20.653 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
Love will flow

204
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.174 line:82%
Raj.
You must have heard of me.

205
00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:37.646 line:82%
The streets of love lie hassled

206
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.274 line:82%
Tied up in shy coy tassels

207
00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:45.613 line:82%
They fight a war with themselves

208
00:31:45.696 --> 00:31:48.449 line:82%
This heart's uncertain in every beat

209
00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:50.993 line:82%
It shies away in coy retreat

210
00:31:51.327 --> 00:31:55.497 line:82%
It says something
Does something else

211
00:31:55.748 --> 00:32:01.462 line:82%
This mischievous heart
Is a riddle, surprise

212
00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:05.633 line:82%
Rushes into love
And pays the price

213
00:32:06.592 --> 00:32:09.094 line:82%
Slow down, love
Let it sink

214
00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:11.555 line:82%
Take a breath
Step back from the brink

215
00:32:11.764 --> 00:32:14.433 line:82%
Toss your cares away
With a wink

216
00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:17.478 line:82%
'Cause life goes by
In a blink

217
00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:22.441 line:82%
Love will flow now
Soft, sweet, slow

218
00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:27.780 line:82%
Love will flow now
Soft, sweet, slow

219
00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:31.909 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow

220
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:43.796 line:82%
Love will flow now
Soft, sweet, slow

221
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:35.013 line:82%
God must have his own God too

222
00:33:35.264 --> 00:33:37.766 line:82%
Who will work His magic ways on you

223
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:42.896 line:82%
And you will see in me
What I see in you

224
00:33:43.272 --> 00:33:45.774 line:82%
In the name of God, let's go

225
00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:48.610 line:82%
Beyond horizons, let's go

226
00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:52.948 line:82%
Carry me away, let's go

227
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.034 line:82%
Remember the words

228
00:33:56.118 --> 00:33:59.037 line:82%
Of the prophet's poem

229
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:03.125 line:82%
In the river of fire
You sink to swim

230
00:34:03.917 --> 00:34:06.420 line:82%
Slow down, love
Let it sink

231
00:34:06.712 --> 00:34:09.131 line:82%
Take a breath
Step back from the brink

232
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:12.134 line:82%
Toss your cares away
With a wink

233
00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:14.803 line:82%
'Cause life goes by
In a blink

234
00:34:14.887 --> 00:34:19.850 line:82%
Love will flow now
Soft, sweet, slow

235
00:34:20.309 --> 00:34:25.189 line:82%
Love will flow now
Soft, sweet, slow

236
00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:29.234 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow

237
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:35.949 line:82%
Love will flow now
Soft, sweet, slow

238
00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:41.747 line:82%
Soft, sweet, slow
They bless us so

239
00:34:58.347 --> 00:34:59.389 line:82%
I'll take that.

240
00:35:07.397 --> 00:35:08.941 line:82%
What is this?

241
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.735 line:82%
These people are teaching dance here.

242
00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:14.196 line:82%
They're a famous company from Bombay.

243
00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:17.741 line:82%
I have always been fond of dancing

244
00:35:18.659 --> 00:35:21.537 line:82%
and I get bored at home all day.

245
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.791 line:82%
If you're not okay with it,

246
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:27.543 line:82%
I won't do it.

247
00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:39.531 line:82%
Bobby, my friend.

248
00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:40.908 line:82%
Yes, Suri, my friend.

249
00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:44.202 line:82%
If I tell you something,
will you tell anyone?

250
00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:47.831 line:82%
Never, my friend.

251
00:36:51.084 --> 00:36:54.338 line:82%
I have fallen in love.

252
00:36:55.839 --> 00:36:58.508 line:82%
Congratulations,
celebrations, fireworks!

253
00:36:58.759 --> 00:37:00.135 line:82%
But, with whom?

254
00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:05.015 line:82%
My wife, Taani.

255
00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:11.980 line:82%
Congratulations, celebrations, fireworks!

256
00:37:12.064 --> 00:37:15.025 line:82%
Cheers! Now that's more like it.

257
00:37:19.488 --> 00:37:24.159 line:82%
But she's not in love with me.

258
00:37:25.786 --> 00:37:27.496 line:82%
How dare she? She's your wife.

259
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:29.915 line:82%
Two slaps and she'll be all right.

260
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:30.958 line:82%
How dare you?

261
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.627 line:82%
You want to slap my wife?

262
00:37:34.378 --> 00:37:37.464 line:82%
No, I want you to slap her.

263
00:37:39.132 --> 00:37:40.759 line:82%
The day I raise my hand on her,

264
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:44.638 line:82%
cut it off with one of your scissors.

265
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:50.435 line:82%
You love her so much?

266
00:37:54.773 --> 00:37:58.568 line:82%
But she says she'll never fall in love
with me.

267
00:38:00.821 --> 00:38:03.782 line:82%
She wants to change herself.

268
00:38:04.408 --> 00:38:09.913 line:82%
She says she'll kill the old Taani
and become a new one.

269
00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:13.375 line:82%
But I'm in love with the old Taani.

270
00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:20.716 line:82%
I want her to remain the same.

271
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:24.678 line:82%
The bubbly, happy-go-lucky Taani.

272
00:38:26.054 --> 00:38:28.306 line:82%
The one I fell in love with

273
00:38:30.142 --> 00:38:33.353 line:82%
the moment I set eyes on her.

274
00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:37.774 line:82%
I don't want her to change.

275
00:38:39.151 --> 00:38:42.904 line:82%
I want her to fall in love with me.

276
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.535 line:82%
Make her fall in love with me, my friend.

277
00:38:49.161 --> 00:38:52.873 line:82%
Do something that makes me
the hero of her life.

278
00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:58.587 line:82%
Like the ones she sees in movies

279
00:38:59.046 --> 00:39:00.255 line:82%
and lights up.

280
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:07.721 line:82%
I wish she could see me the same way
and come into my arms.

281
00:39:15.604 --> 00:39:17.856 line:82%
Work your magic, Bobby.

282
00:39:19.649 --> 00:39:21.651 line:82%
Make my love story, my friend.

283
00:39:24.154 --> 00:39:26.198 line:82%
Bobby, make my love story.

284
00:39:30.577 --> 00:39:32.537 line:82%
Balwinder a.k.a. Bobby Khosla

285
00:39:33.455 --> 00:39:36.083 line:82%
was destined for this job
only to see this day, Suri.

286
00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:41.838 line:82%
You just wait and watch
how I orchestrate your love story.

287
00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:03.235 line:82%
Bobby, will she really
not be able to recognize me?

288
00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:05.070 line:82%
Suri, my friend,

289
00:40:05.278 --> 00:40:11.076 line:82%
if she does, I will close this salon
and go back to my village.

290
00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:12.869 line:82%
That would be fantastic.

291
00:40:13.453 --> 00:40:16.081 line:82%
The thing is,
Taani has joined dance class.

292
00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:20.544 line:82%
I'm dying to see her dancing.
I'll go there first,

293
00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:24.756 line:82%
quietly watch her dancing
to my heart's content,

294
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.925 line:82%
then I'll go home
and surprise her.

295
00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:32.764 line:82%
Hey, what are you doing?
I don't want to shave my mustache.

296
00:40:32.848 --> 00:40:36.601 line:82%
Relax, I am not shaving it,
just trimming it.

297
00:40:36.726 --> 00:40:39.563 line:82%
Girls don't like
thick mustaches nowadays.

298
00:40:40.063 --> 00:40:42.816 line:82%
Be careful!

299
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:45.443 line:82%
You idiot!

300
00:40:47.404 --> 00:40:49.281 line:82%
-What is this?
-It will be back in a minute.

301
00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:51.324 line:82%
-Let me check.
-Where are you going?

302
00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:54.161 line:82%
-I'm so tensed!
-But why?

303
00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:57.956 line:82%
Will Taani like this new Suri?

304
00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:02.586 line:82%
She will come dancing into your arms

305
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.797 line:82%
and will softly whisper in your ears...

306
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:07.132 line:82%
What?

307
00:41:07.299 --> 00:41:08.425 line:82%
Suri.

308
00:41:08.508 --> 00:41:10.552 line:82%
-Yes.
-I love you.

309
00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:11.678 line:82%
How much?

310
00:43:26.396 --> 00:43:27.897 line:82%
We, the people from Mumbai,
never knew

311
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:30.859 line:82%
that people in Amritsar
could dance so well.

312
00:43:40.201 --> 00:43:43.038 line:82%
You must have noticed that we have
divided you all into two groups.

313
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:44.706 line:82%
Group Green and Group Red.

314
00:43:45.332 --> 00:43:47.792 line:82%
Now, one person from Group Red
will be paired with

315
00:43:47.876 --> 00:43:49.586 line:82%
one person from Group Green.

316
00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:53.089 line:82%
Because after all, the real fun
of dancing lies in partner dancing.

317
00:43:53.173 --> 00:43:57.677 line:82%
Okay, people of Amritsar,
find your partner!

318
00:44:31.086 --> 00:44:33.004 line:82%
What is this madness?

319
00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:39.469 line:82%
I'm sorry.

320
00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:41.554 line:82%
There has been a misunderstanding.

321
00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:43.264 line:82%
I can't dance for nuts.

322
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:46.476 line:82%
Please listen to me.
I have never danced before.

323
00:44:46.893 --> 00:44:49.187 line:82%
Don't do this.

324
00:44:58.655 --> 00:45:01.908 line:82%
No, Surinder.
No running away now.

325
00:45:02.075 --> 00:45:04.077 line:82%
You have to become Taani's hero!

326
00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.123 line:82%
You are not "Suri, I work
For Punjab Power" anymore.

327
00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:10.583 line:82%
You are not Taani's hero.

328
00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:13.336 line:82%
You sing songs,
you dance,

329
00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:19.175 line:82%
you save the girl,
you kill the bad guys.

330
00:45:31.104 --> 00:45:34.149 line:82%
And I am your hero.

331
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:35.275 line:82%
What?

332
00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:36.734 line:82%
I mean...

333
00:45:57.005 --> 00:45:58.673 line:82%
You must have heard of me.

334
00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:04.179 line:82%
No, I haven't.

335
00:46:04.304 --> 00:46:08.224 line:82%
Don't worry. You will
keep hearing it from now on.

336
00:46:10.268 --> 00:46:11.686 line:82%
All right, then, I'll see you tomorrow.

337
00:46:12.479 --> 00:46:15.773 line:82%
No, I mean,

338
00:46:18.985 --> 00:46:21.196 line:82%
Never say good bye.

339
00:46:22.947 --> 00:46:26.868 line:82%
Always say,
we are traveling the love lane,

340
00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:32.665 line:82%
we will meet again along the way.

341
00:46:35.585 --> 00:46:36.669 line:82%
Okay.

342
00:46:52.185 --> 00:46:56.272 line:82%
Raj, we are traveling the love lane,

343
00:46:56.356 --> 00:46:58.691 line:82%
we will meet again along the way.

344
00:46:59.317 --> 00:47:03.196 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane,
we will meet again along the way.

345
00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:30.139 line:82%
I just don't get it.

346
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:34.060 line:82%
You said you'll watch Taani dance
and then go home and surprise her.

347
00:47:34.352 --> 00:47:36.688 line:82%
And now you are making me
make this fake mustache?

348
00:47:36.771 --> 00:47:37.814 line:82%
You fool.

349
00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:40.066 line:82%
I have gotten the opportunity to dance
with Taani everyday,

350
00:47:40.149 --> 00:47:41.651 line:82%
and you want me to let it go?

351
00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:43.486 line:82%
What do you think?

352
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.155 line:82%
When Taani finds out
that I am her partner,

353
00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:48.533 line:82%
do you think she'll dance with someone
as lame as me?

354
00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:49.826 line:82%
Never.

355
00:47:50.243 --> 00:47:52.036 line:82%
And even if she did,

356
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:56.165 line:82%
she wouldn't be
the same Taani I saw today.

357
00:47:57.166 --> 00:47:58.876 line:82%
-Understood?
-What are you trying to say?

358
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.753 line:82%
You just don't get it.

359
00:48:01.212 --> 00:48:06.593 line:82%
Suri reminds Taani of her tragedy,
her sadness.

360
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.139 line:82%
She can never be the old Taani
around Suri.

361
00:48:12.557 --> 00:48:15.393 line:82%
By pretending to be Raj,

362
00:48:15.977 --> 00:48:18.313 line:82%
I have the chance
to spend some time with her.

363
00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:23.568 line:82%
Tell me something.
Amongst all those people,

364
00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:27.238 line:82%
why did I get to be
Taani's dance partner?

365
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.948 line:82%
How do I know?

366
00:48:30.033 --> 00:48:31.576 line:82%
I'll tell you.

367
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.000 line:82%
It was God's will.

368
00:48:42.378 --> 00:48:45.840 line:82%
If he wanted, she could have
easily recognized me in a second.

369
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.717 line:82%
But He didn't do that,

370
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.218 line:82%
do you know why?

371
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:50.553 line:82%
Why?

372
00:48:54.474 --> 00:48:57.018 line:82%
Listen to what God is saying.

373
00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:06.527 line:82%
God is saying,

374
00:49:09.322 --> 00:49:15.203 line:82%
"Suri, look,
I've set things in motion.

375
00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:20.291 line:82%
Dance with Taani
to your heart's content,

376
00:49:21.209 --> 00:49:25.588 line:82%
get to know her better,
make her laugh,

377
00:49:26.422 --> 00:49:32.136 line:82%
give her heaps of happiness,
so that she forgets all her pain

378
00:49:33.262 --> 00:49:37.767 line:82%
and becomes your fun-loving Taani forever.

379
00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:44.565 line:82%
Become Raj
and express your feelings to her.

380
00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:50.321 line:82%
Tell her everything Suri cannot tell her.

381
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:55.410 line:82%
Now go live your love story."

382
00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:08.047 line:82%
You got me all emotional again.

383
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:12.927 line:82%
Here is your mustache,

384
00:50:14.095 --> 00:50:16.723 line:82%
and Suri is back.

385
00:50:30.445 --> 00:50:32.905 line:82%
I am sorry I got late,
I'll just change and come.

386
00:50:32.989 --> 00:50:34.949 line:82%
-Give me your lunch box.
-All right.

387
00:50:35.825 --> 00:50:36.868 line:82%
What is the matter?

388
00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:39.912 line:82%
Nothing. I seem to have sprained
my neck.

389
00:50:39.996 --> 00:50:41.748 line:82%
I'll come. Please re-heat the food.

390
00:50:57.305 --> 00:51:00.641 line:82%
Taani, I'll be late every night.

391
00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:04.103 line:82%
I am working overtime
at the office this month.

392
00:51:05.146 --> 00:51:08.024 line:82%
You'll be busy with dance class
in the evenings,

393
00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:11.277 line:82%
so I thought it best
to take on some more work.

394
00:51:12.445 --> 00:51:13.529 line:82%
Okay.

395
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:40.199 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane,
we will meet again along the way.

396
00:52:40.283 --> 00:52:41.492 line:82%
She's my sister, dude.

397
00:52:48.457 --> 00:52:50.626 line:82%
You must have heard of me, right?

398
00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:58.175 line:82%
The thing is there was
no other color left in the store.

399
00:52:58.259 --> 00:52:59.719 line:82%
These mama's boys bought them all.

400
00:52:59.802 --> 00:53:03.222 line:82%
But even if there were any other color,
I would have picked this one.

401
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:07.435 line:82%
Yellow has become my favorite color
since yesterday,

402
00:53:07.935 --> 00:53:10.479 line:82%
because I saw you
for the first time yesterday

403
00:53:10.563 --> 00:53:12.857 line:82%
and you were in yellow too.

404
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.486 line:82%
Listen, Mr. Raj!

405
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:19.447 line:82%
I do not appreciate such talk.

406
00:53:19.822 --> 00:53:22.241 line:82%
Please stop trying to flirt with me.

407
00:53:22.325 --> 00:53:23.659 line:82%
But where am I flirting?

408
00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:25.745 line:82%
It would be flirting
if I told you that

409
00:53:25.828 --> 00:53:28.748 line:82%
I have never seen a girl
more beautiful than you.

410
00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:32.543 line:82%
And when you were dancing,

411
00:53:32.627 --> 00:53:36.881 line:82%
your hair was swinging left and right
and took my heart away.

412
00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:40.885 line:82%
But I didn't say anything like that.

413
00:53:47.642 --> 00:53:49.727 line:82%
Sorry, Mr. Raj, but I wont be able
to dance with you.

414
00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:51.437 line:82%
No, I am sorry, I apologize.

415
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.314 line:82%
See, the thing is
I am a loud-mouthed rowdy.

416
00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:55.316 line:82%
I don't know how to converse
with decent women

417
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:56.984 line:82%
and you are very simple.

418
00:53:57.068 --> 00:53:58.319 line:82%
So, I will never talk around you.

419
00:53:58.402 --> 00:53:59.445 line:82%
I'll be absolutely quiet.

420
00:53:59.528 --> 00:54:00.446 line:82%
I promise.

421
00:54:01.364 --> 00:54:06.118 line:82%
Sorry, wrong finger.
One chance, just one chance.

422
00:54:13.668 --> 00:54:14.919 line:82%
Okay, then.

423
00:54:15.836 --> 00:54:19.173 line:82%
Taani partner, you didn't say anything,
but this dress is sexy, no?

424
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.763 line:82%
My outfit is quite cool.

425
00:54:41.779 --> 00:54:43.906 line:82%
-Raj, come here.
-Coming, coming.

426
00:55:15.896 --> 00:55:20.693 line:82%
Punjab's number one bike
and number one dude at your service.

427
00:55:20.985 --> 00:55:22.737 line:82%
No, it's all right. I'll manage.

428
00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.155 line:82%
Don't think so much.

429
00:55:24.238 --> 00:55:28.034 line:82%
It's raining, you'll get wet.
Come on, I'll drop you home.

430
00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:30.077 line:82%
Sit down, please.

431
00:55:30.494 --> 00:55:32.913 line:82%
Why are you saying thank you?
I should thank you.

432
00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:36.083 line:82%
All right then, ready steady go.

433
00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:38.461 line:82%
Damn, my hair will get messed up.

434
00:55:47.553 --> 00:55:49.430 line:82%
They say whatever you wish for
while getting wet in the first rain

435
00:55:49.513 --> 00:55:51.724 line:82%
is surely granted.

436
00:55:51.807 --> 00:55:52.892 line:82%
-Really?
-Of course!

437
00:55:52.975 --> 00:55:54.685 line:82%
Superb! So, what did you ask for?

438
00:55:54.769 --> 00:55:56.312 line:82%
It was granted
as soon as I asked for it.

439
00:55:56.395 --> 00:55:59.899 line:82%
That the world's most beautiful girl
should sit on my pillion.

440
00:55:59.982 --> 00:56:03.486 line:82%
Raj, you are flirting with me again.
Stop the bike, I'll go on my own.

441
00:56:03.569 --> 00:56:06.530 line:82%
Okay, I am sorry, I apologize,
never again.

442
00:56:13.579 --> 00:56:16.207 line:82%
So, Taani partner, what did you wish for
in this first rain?

443
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:17.166 line:82%
Nothing.

444
00:56:17.249 --> 00:56:18.584 line:82%
Taani partner, I am sure
your heart wants something.

445
00:56:18.667 --> 00:56:19.960 line:82%
No, my heart does not want anything.

446
00:56:20.044 --> 00:56:22.379 line:82%
How is that possible, Taani partner?
Everyone's heart wants something.

447
00:56:22.463 --> 00:56:23.506 line:82%
You seem to know everything,

448
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:25.549 line:82%
so why don't you tell me
what my heart wants?

449
00:56:26.425 --> 00:56:27.510 line:82%
Should I?

450
00:56:28.177 --> 00:56:29.220 line:82%
Yeah.

451
00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:33.808 line:82%
Your heart wants to stop hurting.

452
00:56:38.938 --> 00:56:42.149 line:82%
Caught you now, didn't I?
Now you are not saying anything?

453
00:56:42.316 --> 00:56:43.567 line:82%
Say something, yes or no?

454
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:59.375 line:82%
Taani partner, close your eyes
and let every raindrop reach your heart.

455
00:56:59.458 --> 00:57:02.086 line:82%
What are you doing, Raj?
Who will watch the road?

456
00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:04.463 line:82%
You are watching it, right?

457
00:57:04.588 --> 00:57:06.132 line:82%
Please look straight and drive properly.

458
00:57:06.215 --> 00:57:08.801 line:82%
Okay. Here we go.

459
00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:13.472 line:82%
This is it. Please stop here.

460
00:57:13.556 --> 00:57:16.016 line:82%
Okay then, your stop has come.

461
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.226 line:82%
Okay, thank you, bye!

462
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:23.607 line:82%
Right! We'll meet again.

463
00:57:28.237 --> 00:57:31.907 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane,
down the road, we will meet again. Happy?

464
00:57:35.077 --> 00:57:36.662 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane.

465
00:57:43.043 --> 00:57:48.007 line:82%
Have you ever tasted the first raindrops?
They taste heavenly.

466
00:58:18.954 --> 00:58:24.335 line:82%
Taani partner, close your eyes
and let every raindrop reach your heart.

467
00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:47.942 line:82%
I am sorry. I had some trouble
with the car and got late.

468
00:58:51.612 --> 00:58:53.656 line:82%
Taani, can you please close the windows?

469
00:58:54.073 --> 00:58:55.991 line:82%
The floor will get spoilt
because of the rainwater.

470
00:58:56.909 --> 00:58:57.993 line:82%
All right.

471
00:59:27.106 --> 00:59:28.065 line:82%
This is milk with turmeric.

472
00:59:29.149 --> 00:59:30.359 line:82%
It's good for your cold.

473
00:59:32.152 --> 00:59:33.195 line:82%
Thank you.

474
01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:39.720 line:82%
Raj, what on earth are you doing?

475
01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:40.971 line:82%
Chill, I am all right.

476
01:00:45.434 --> 01:00:48.562 line:82%
Hey why are you sticking your finger
in my nose?

477
01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:50.898 line:82%
Would you like it if I stick my finger
in your nose?

478
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.191 line:82%
At least not my nose.

479
01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:56.695 line:82%
I have got it now.

480
01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:03.869 line:82%
Where are you going?

481
01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:05.496 line:82%
Raj, leave me.

482
01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:07.039 line:82%
Why are you going into my armpits now?

483
01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:08.707 line:82%
What the hell are you doing?

484
01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:09.833 line:82%
Please don't get over familiar with me.

485
01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:10.959 line:82%
Do what they are teaching.

486
01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:12.836 line:82%
Look how well the other girls
are dancing, come, come.

487
01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:15.672 line:82%
Give me your hand.

488
01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:17.800 line:82%
Take my hand, take my nose,
take whatever you want.

489
01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:22.763 line:82%
Do you know this one?
Ringaa Ringaa Roses?

490
01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:25.391 line:82%
What the hell is your problem?

491
01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:28.018 line:82%
They do this in villages,
during festivals.

492
01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:29.228 line:82%
I don't want to do it!

493
01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:36.068 line:82%
Listen up, everyone, from Monday,
we will start the dance competition.

494
01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.779 line:82%
Every couple will get points each week,

495
01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.907 line:82%
and then, the top ten couples
will compete in the finals.

496
01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:44.785 line:82%
Whoever wins will be proclaimed

497
01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.329 line:82%
the best dancing pair in Amritsar.

498
01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.464 line:82%
This Madonna madam is 100% correct.

499
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.551 line:82%
I have a strong feeling from within,
Taani partner,

500
01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:04.221 line:82%
that we will be the winning pair.

501
01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:05.264 line:82%
What do you think?

502
01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:09.476 line:82%
We'll come last, not first.

503
01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.541 line:82%
It isn't raining today,
I can go on my own. Thank you.

504
01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:34.751 line:82%
No, that's not why I am here.

505
01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:39.590 line:82%
Taani partner, I think you should
change your dance partner.

506
01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:47.055 line:82%
See, I know that my dancing
is even worse than my talking,

507
01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:52.102 line:82%
but you are amazing.

508
01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.229 line:82%
You will surely come first.

509
01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:58.942 line:82%
But if I am your partner,
you will certainly lose

510
01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:05.282 line:82%
and I really won't like
to see that happen.

511
01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.286 line:82%
Okay?

512
01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:14.917 line:82%
So then, it's sure that from Monday,
you'll find a new partner.

513
01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:16.210 line:82%
All right, then.

514
01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:19.963 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane,
down the road, we will meet again.

515
01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:32.809 line:82%
Here, buddy, you can end Raj's story.

516
01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.436 line:82%
Just think again, Suri.

517
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.981 line:82%
I have thought about it enough.
I can't see Taani upset.

518
01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:39.441 line:82%
She was so disappointed

519
01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:41.818 line:82%
when she heard about the competition
and looked at me.

520
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:45.280 line:82%
How long was this going to last anyway?

521
01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:48.951 line:82%
So, it's best we end this here.

522
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:53.163 line:82%
Anyway, I am happy with this much.

523
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:57.960 line:82%
Moreover, this damn Raj
wears really tight clothes.

524
01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.712 line:82%
It hurts a lot
in the front and the back.

525
01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:04.049 line:82%
Hey buddy,
I have to take Taani out for a film.

526
01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:06.385 line:82%
I am late. I'll leave now.
I'll see you later.

527
01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:14.351 line:82%
All right then, Raj buddy,
your role ends here.

528
01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:16.353 line:82%
I could not be yours
in this lifetime, Rahul.

529
01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:23.819 line:82%
But I promise that I'll be yours
in all the others.

530
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.490 line:82%
I'll wait for you in all my lives to come.

531
01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:37.874 line:82%
Taani partner.

532
01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:45.215 line:82%
Getting bored, right?

533
01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:49.136 line:82%
Modern love stories
have lost their charm.

534
01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:55.559 line:82%
I have learnt about love
from the Gods of love.

535
01:04:55.934 --> 01:05:01.148 line:82%
So, I'll show you love and romance,
Hindi movie style.

536
01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:34.181 line:82%
I'm in love, I feel so high

537
01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:38.143 line:82%
Here's where I live
And here I'll die

538
01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:41.605 line:82%
Away from your arms, your streets

539
01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.484 line:82%
I wouldn't know where to fly

540
01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:49.655 line:82%
My heart's a tramp
With two left feet

541
01:05:49.738 --> 01:05:54.409 line:82%
Now tell me
Are we to ever meet?

542
01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:57.788 line:82%
In every life
We change our form

543
01:05:58.038 --> 01:06:01.792 line:82%
On dream's curtains are we reborn

544
01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:05.462 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

545
01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:09.383 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

546
01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:13.178 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

547
01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:17.265 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

548
01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.627 line:82%
Bees buzz inside my heart

549
01:06:45.711 --> 01:06:49.381 line:82%
When I smell the flower of love

550
01:06:49.715 --> 01:06:53.093 line:82%
Come on, love
Now sing your part

551
01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:57.389 line:82%
My heart flutters like a dove

552
01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:05.063 line:82%
Opposite your house
I'll build one smaller

553
01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:06.648 line:82%
Even though it won't do

554
01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:12.195 line:82%
Someone love me just for a moment
even if it's untrue

555
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:16.241 line:82%
Even if it's untrue

556
01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:20.495 line:82%
In every life
We change our form

557
01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:24.291 line:82%
On dream's curtains are we reborn

558
01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:28.253 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

559
01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:32.215 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

560
01:07:32.299 --> 01:07:36.011 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

561
01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:39.681 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

562
01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:04.623 line:82%
Oh, pretty woman
With the lush long hair

563
01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:12.589 line:82%
To the world I'm Junglee
Without a care

564
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:18.094 line:82%
Roam the night, you do,
Singing "Yahoo, yahoo!"

565
01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:21.681 line:82%
Roam the night, you do,
Singing "Yahoo, yahoo!"

566
01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:25.727 line:82%
With stars wrapped around you

567
01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:29.731 line:82%
In every life
We change our form

568
01:08:29.815 --> 01:08:33.735 line:82%
On dream's curtains are we reborn

569
01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:37.364 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

570
01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:41.326 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

571
01:08:41.409 --> 01:08:45.247 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

572
01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:49.167 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

573
01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:09.688 line:82%
Praise the lord Shiv Shankar

574
01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:11.606 line:82%
'Cause you just can't strike or junk Him

575
01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:15.360 line:82%
However hard you try

576
01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.237 line:82%
You're my soul-mate, it seems

577
01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.406 line:82%
The princess of my dreams

578
01:09:19.614 --> 01:09:22.909 line:82%
I think now I can fly

579
01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:28.957 line:82%
The world will talk, don't heed it

580
01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:36.506 line:82%
Pray I find peace, I need it

581
01:09:38.884 --> 01:09:42.804 line:82%
In every life
We change our form

582
01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:46.683 line:82%
On dream's curtains are we reborn

583
01:09:46.766 --> 01:09:50.478 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

584
01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:54.399 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

585
01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:58.403 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

586
01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:02.449 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

587
01:10:23.637 --> 01:10:25.305 line:82%
Oh, this ache in my heart

588
01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.932 line:82%
I ache in every part

589
01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:31.269 line:82%
But I'll show the world still

590
01:10:31.353 --> 01:10:32.896 line:82%
Oh, this ache in my heart

591
01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:34.606 line:82%
I ache in every part

592
01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:38.902 line:82%
But I'll show the world still

593
01:10:39.361 --> 01:10:42.739 line:82%
I'm as good as the best

594
01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:46.534 line:82%
I want you to know

595
01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:49.788 line:82%
You have my vow

596
01:10:50.705 --> 01:10:53.625 line:82%
My love

597
01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:58.254 line:82%
In every life
We change our form

598
01:10:58.338 --> 01:11:02.342 line:82%
On dream's curtains are we reborn

599
01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.971 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

600
01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:09.766 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

601
01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:13.770 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

602
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.774 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

603
01:11:25.532 --> 01:11:28.994 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane

604
01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:32.914 line:82%
Down the road we'll meet again

605
01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:49.931 line:82%
Taani, please sit down.

606
01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.395 line:82%
Need some water?

607
01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:23.339 line:82%
Actually, my partner, Raj,
hasn't come in today.

608
01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:25.383 line:82%
Do you have his number or address?

609
01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:31.014 line:82%
Yes, Raj Kapoor.

610
01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:32.057 line:82%
There's no number,

611
01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:36.061 line:82%
but the address is
Raju Motors, 21, Gol Maseed.

612
01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:37.395 line:82%
Raju Motors?

613
01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:57.707 line:82%
How much longer, Raju?

614
01:12:57.832 --> 01:13:01.336 line:82%
Almost done, buddy,
but tell me something,

615
01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:03.880 line:82%
why does Suri keep riding your bike?

616
01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:07.008 line:82%
I just sold him
a brand New Hyundai i10.

617
01:13:07.092 --> 01:13:10.345 line:82%
Long story. I'll tell you some other time.
Hurry up, please.

618
01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:11.471 line:82%
Almost done, buddy.

619
01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:15.183 line:82%
Raju sir, some lady is here
looking for Raj Kapoor.

620
01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:20.605 line:82%
Idiot, even my mother has been looking
for Raj Kapoor for years.

621
01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:24.484 line:82%
Listen. Ask her to sit
and tell her that Raj

622
01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.486 line:82%
is coming in some time.

623
01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.905 line:82%
Raj Kapoor, the actor is coming here?
I'll just call my mother...

624
01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:32.700 line:82%
Not Raj Kapoor, the actor,
Suri is the Raj she's looking for.

625
01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:35.036 line:82%
How did Suri become Raj Kapoor?
What is going on?

626
01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.499 line:82%
Like I said, long story.
I'll tell you later. Now, hide the bike.

627
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.838 line:82%
Buddy, there is something important
you have to do.

628
01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:54.180 line:82%
Hey Suri, I am calling from Raju's garage.

629
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:59.853 line:82%
Your wife is here looking for Raj.

630
01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.354 line:82%
Taani has reached there?

631
01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:03.815 line:82%
Now what do I do?

632
01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:06.109 line:82%
I told you
that I have ended the Raj episode

633
01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:08.236 line:82%
so she can come first
in the competition.

634
01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:11.364 line:82%
I know that,
but you seem to have forgotten

635
01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:16.119 line:82%
that now this story is being written
by God, not you.

636
01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:20.915 line:82%
And how and when Raj's episode will end,
is upto Him, not you.

637
01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:24.335 line:82%
You just get here fast.
I have made her wait here.

638
01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:27.547 line:82%
Buddy, I am coming right away.

639
01:14:28.548 --> 01:14:30.800 line:82%
But, where are my clothes?

640
01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:32.886 line:82%
In my cupboard.

641
01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.180 line:82%
All right, I'll be there in ten minutes.

642
01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:50.862 line:82%
Here you go.

643
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.368 line:82%
So, Taani partner, did my boys
take care of you properly?

644
01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:40.036 line:82%
Absolutely. Lovely hospitality.

645
01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.913 line:82%
They learnt from the best.
Now, come on.

646
01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:44.040 line:82%
What are you looking at?

647
01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:45.792 line:82%
Enough of your singing,

648
01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:49.254 line:82%
I am not paying you
to idle away your time.

649
01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:51.172 line:82%
Go do some work, come on.

650
01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:55.260 line:82%
Have to keep them under control.

651
01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:57.136 line:82%
Did they serve you biscuits?

652
01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.221 line:82%
I am sorry.

653
01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.181 line:82%
Trying to impress the girl
with your English?

654
01:16:00.265 --> 01:16:02.767 line:82%
Come on, you oaf, get to work now.

655
01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:11.484 line:82%
Why didn't you come
to dance school today?

656
01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:15.238 line:82%
The thing is I have I stopped dancing.
It is quite boring

657
01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:17.824 line:82%
and not something
dudes like me can do.

658
01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:23.955 line:82%
You don't want to dance with me

659
01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:25.498 line:82%
so I don't end up losing. Right?

660
01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.543 line:82%
No, nothing like that.

661
01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:31.296 line:82%
Neither am I going to leave my partner,

662
01:16:32.964 --> 01:16:34.590 line:82%
nor am I going to lose.

663
01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:39.721 line:82%
You know, earlier I thought
you were a cheap thug.

664
01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:44.309 line:82%
But now I have realized that

665
01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:46.102 line:82%
under all this, you're a good hearted guy.

666
01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:49.605 line:82%
If you can worry about me losing,

667
01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:52.108 line:82%
can't I worry about your dance?

668
01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:55.403 line:82%
Now that we are partners,
we will remain partners till the end.

669
01:16:56.487 --> 01:17:01.159 line:82%
And anyway if you promise
to work hard and practice,

670
01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:03.828 line:82%
I also promise you
that we will definitely win.

671
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:11.210 line:82%
Taani partner, I had told you
that you'd miss me.

672
01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:14.339 line:82%
Looks like Raj's magic has worked on you.

673
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.258 line:82%
You have started again, Raj?

674
01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:19.719 line:82%
Please promise me one more thing.

675
01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:22.138 line:82%
You will never flirt with me again.

676
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:26.476 line:82%
No way, I can promise to do
extra practice, to work harder,

677
01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:29.562 line:82%
but I can't promise to stop flirting.

678
01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:32.523 line:82%
You see this flirting
comes naturally to me,

679
01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.150 line:82%
I cannot control it.

680
01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:35.777 line:82%
It's God's gift.

681
01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.614 line:82%
Raj, we are friends from today
and you will behave like one.

682
01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:45.036 line:82%
Okay then, we'll meet
tomorrow at dance class.

683
01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.415 line:82%
Taani partner,

684
01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:53.252 line:82%
you are forgetting something.

685
01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:58.591 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane,
down the road, we will meet again.

686
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:03.054 line:82%
Man, I'll die of happiness.

687
01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:09.102 line:82%
It's a match made in heaven

688
01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:14.315 line:82%
You may agree or not with thing

689
01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:19.821 line:82%
But it's in the song
The minstrel sings

690
01:18:20.822 --> 01:18:25.660 line:82%
It's a match made in heaven

691
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.138 line:82%
Bobby, are you sleeping?

692
01:18:48.975 --> 01:18:50.393 line:82%
Here, hold this.

693
01:18:52.812 --> 01:18:54.772 line:82%
Come on, buddy,
we were having such great fun.

694
01:18:57.692 --> 01:19:00.570 line:82%
Where are my pants now and when...

695
01:19:01.988 --> 01:19:05.324 line:82%
There you are.

696
01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:10.663 line:82%
Suri buddy, did you see Raj's style?

697
01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:14.959 line:82%
Taani partner couldn't resist coming here.

698
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.336 line:82%
Did you hear what she said?

699
01:19:17.837 --> 01:19:20.923 line:82%
From today, we are friends.

700
01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.138 line:82%
And you have seen enough Hindi films

701
01:19:27.221 --> 01:19:30.892 line:82%
to know that a girl and a guy
can never be friends.

702
01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:34.270 line:82%
After friendship,

703
01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:40.860 line:82%
comes love and romance.

704
01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:47.492 line:82%
So now, I will hold Taani's hand
and while I dance and romance her,

705
01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:53.581 line:82%
you can happily hold onto
your lunch box.

706
01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:58.836 line:82%
Why are you standing
like a villain between us?

707
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.464 line:82%
You married her and spoilt her life.

708
01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:03.341 line:82%
She's like Miss World

709
01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:06.260 line:82%
and you are Suri
"I work for Punjab Power."

710
01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:09.347 line:82%
Listen, buddy,

711
01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:12.433 line:82%
before she runs away with me,

712
01:20:13.643 --> 01:20:15.853 line:82%
and you are left in shock,

713
01:20:16.604 --> 01:20:19.190 line:82%
you should step aside.

714
01:20:20.525 --> 01:20:22.902 line:82%
So that this lover boy

715
01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:25.905 line:82%
can take his bride away gloriously
into the sunset

716
01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:28.741 line:82%
and the audience bursts
into a thunderous applause at the end.

717
01:20:33.204 --> 01:20:36.707 line:82%
Hey, why are you so quiet?

718
01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.002 line:82%
All right, take your time,
think it over,

719
01:20:40.628 --> 01:20:41.546 line:82%
we'll talk tomorrow.

720
01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:47.218 line:82%
Did you think about it?

721
01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:49.971 line:82%
I will tell you what you are thinking.

722
01:20:51.681 --> 01:20:56.602 line:82%
You are worried that Taani

723
01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:00.606 line:82%
will completely forget Suri.

724
01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:06.612 line:82%
What if she never falls in love with Suri?

725
01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:12.785 line:82%
What if in the end,
Suri is the one left saying

726
01:21:14.579 --> 01:21:15.913 line:82%
"We are traveling the love lane,

727
01:21:17.248 --> 01:21:21.377 line:82%
"down the road, we will meet again."

728
01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:28.069 line:82%
Put your left leg in

729
01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:30.029 line:82%
And your right leg out

730
01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.573 line:82%
Come on, baby, let's start

731
01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:35.618 line:82%
Turn your head around

732
01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:37.495 line:82%
Swing your legs up and down

733
01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.789 line:82%
That's all it takes, let's start

734
01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:42.792 line:82%
Hey dude, check it out

735
01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:44.627 line:82%
Sing, dance, twist and shout

736
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:48.047 line:82%
Take my hand and hit the floor now

737
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:52.218 line:82%
Take a chance on this dance
Oh my beloved

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:46.230 line:82%
Now flick your hand to the tune

742
01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:49.483 line:82%
Like a clock hand
From seven to noon

743
01:23:49.567 --> 01:23:52.987 line:82%
You've got yourself a step

744
01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:56.949 line:82%
A step that's made you hep

745
01:23:57.575 --> 01:24:01.245 line:82%
Now swing your hip without a care

746
01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:04.540 line:82%
Like a figure of eight in the air

747
01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:08.169 line:82%
You've got yourself a step

748
01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:12.006 line:82%
A step that's made you hep

749

Throw a hand up, shake it well

Like you're ringing a temple bell

758
01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:21.408 line:82%
You've got yourself a step

759
01:25:21.492 --> 01:25:24.495 line:82%
A step that's made you hep

760

Shake the other hand below

761
01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:32.711 line:82%
Like you'd tug a kite
To make it soar

762
01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:36.298 line:82%
You've got yourself a step

763
01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:39.552 line:82%

764

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.230 line:82%
You both have been selected

775
01:26:33.314 --> 01:26:35.816 line:82%
to compete in the finals!

776
01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:05.220 line:82%
What will you have?

777
01:27:05.304 --> 01:27:06.388 line:82%
Gol guppa.

778
01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.266 line:82%
How many?

779
01:27:10.059 --> 01:27:11.352 line:82%
Sweetheart,

780
01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:14.188 line:82%
you just keep bringing them,
today there's no limit.

781
01:27:14.355 --> 01:27:15.689 line:82%
Very well then.

782
01:27:15.773 --> 01:27:16.815 line:82%
What's so good, huh?

783
01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:18.692 line:82%
What do you mean by no limit?

784
01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:21.820 line:82%
Raj partner, gol guppa competition.

785
01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:24.073 line:82%
Competition in this too?

786
01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:27.284 line:82%
Then, tell me.

787
01:27:28.285 --> 01:27:30.663 line:82%
What prize does the winner get?

788
01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:36.835 line:82%
The winner can get the loser
to do anything once.

789
01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:39.380 line:82%
-Anything?
-Absolutely.

790
01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:40.839 line:82%
And the loser can't refuse.

791
01:27:41.382 --> 01:27:43.092 line:82%
In that case, Taani partner,
you have lost,

792
01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:46.095 line:82%
because Raj will eat
all the gol guppas in Amritsar,

793
01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:47.388 line:82%
but won't lose.

794
01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:53.602 line:82%
Bring on the gol guppas!

795
01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:11.996 line:82%
Bring it on.

796
01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:23.215 line:82%
Bring it on.

797
01:28:26.844 --> 01:28:29.263 line:82%
Taani partner, if you are tired,
feel free to give up.

798
01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:41.418 line:82%
Congratulate me?

799
01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:45.714 line:82%
I have been selected to compete
in the finals.

800
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.227 line:82%
I have made biryani today.

801
01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:00.813 line:82%
Let me heat it up
while you freshen up.

802
01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:02.898 line:82%
Biryani?

803
01:30:04.525 --> 01:30:05.567 line:82%
You don't like it?

804
01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:10.906 line:82%
Of course I like it, I love it!

805
01:30:16.203 --> 01:30:17.454 line:82%
I'll be right back.

806
01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:48.318 line:82%
Your plate?

807
01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:51.405 line:82%
I am full. I actually ate
a lot of snacks on the way.

808
01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:54.324 line:82%
Raj and I went out to celebrate.

809
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:58.996 line:82%
Raj? Who is Raj?

810
01:31:01.165 --> 01:31:02.916 line:82%
I totally forgot to tell you.

811
01:31:03.333 --> 01:31:05.419 line:82%
Raj is my dance partner.

812
01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:07.421 line:82%
This dance competition is in pairs.

813
01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:09.298 line:82%
Each person is given a partner.

814
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:12.301 line:82%
He has his own garage,
Raju Garage.

815
01:31:12.718 --> 01:31:15.387 line:82%
He is a very funny guy.
Always makes me laugh!

816
01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:26.398 line:82%
You didn't like the biryani?

817
01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:36.491 line:82%
Brilliant!

818
01:31:59.056 --> 01:32:00.349 line:82%
Suri buddy,

819
01:32:01.183 --> 01:32:03.227 line:82%
Taani was right.

820
01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:06.730 line:82%
This love is a very painful thing.

821
01:32:08.106 --> 01:32:11.777 line:82%
There's pain in disguising oneself,
pain in dancing,

822
01:32:12.653 --> 01:32:14.947 line:82%
and now pain even in eating.

823
01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:19.868 line:82%
This love will surely
kill you one day, Suri!

824
01:32:39.763 --> 01:32:40.889 line:82%
Are you hurt?

825
01:32:45.227 --> 01:32:47.521 line:82%
Keep quiet,
I know people like you.

826
01:32:47.604 --> 01:32:48.939 line:82%
You hit intentionally
and then say sorry

827
01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:50.816 line:82%
so that the best of the competition

828
01:32:50.983 --> 01:32:52.359 line:82%
goes out right at the beginning.

829
01:32:53.277 --> 01:32:55.237 line:82%
Hey you, Miss Wannabe!

830
01:32:55.362 --> 01:32:58.448 line:82%
If you say 'bitch' once more,
you won't know what hit you.

831
01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.618 line:82%
Taani partner,
you just ignore this fool.

832
01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.747 line:82%
Raj is here, so why fear?
I'll talk to her!

833
01:33:10.419 --> 01:33:11.712 line:82%
-Talk!
-What?

834
01:33:12.296 --> 01:33:13.338 line:82%
Talk to me!

835
01:33:13.422 --> 01:33:15.173 line:82%
To hell with the talk,

836
01:33:15.257 --> 01:33:19.303 line:82%
I'll just say sorry
on my partner's behalf

837
01:33:19.386 --> 01:33:21.805 line:82%
and you say sorry
on your partner's behalf.

838
01:33:22.306 --> 01:33:23.849 line:82%
-Make me say it!
-What?

839
01:33:24.141 --> 01:33:27.352 line:82%
Tiny! See what happened to my leg.

840
01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:29.521 line:82%
Tiny?

841
01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:34.109 line:82%
My name is Tiny Singh.
You have a problem?

842
01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:36.320 line:82%
No. Size doesn't matter.

843
01:33:36.403 --> 01:33:38.655 line:82%
Men should be tough like you.

844
01:33:38.739 --> 01:33:42.451 line:82%
My own pet name is "Little."
Chicken Little.

845
01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:44.119 line:82%
Let's just put this behind us.

846
01:33:44.328 --> 01:33:45.704 line:82%
I'll say sorry on everyone's behalf.

847
01:33:48.874 --> 01:33:50.751 line:82%
Wanna hug? Okay, no hug.

848
01:33:51.668 --> 01:33:52.794 line:82%
Let's get out of here.

849
01:33:55.088 --> 01:33:56.131 line:82%
What did she say?

850
01:33:56.214 --> 01:34:00.135 line:82%
"Itch," she said "itch."

851
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:03.221 line:82%
And man, your biceps are glowing
in this light, I must say.

852
01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:04.348 line:82%
Where did you get this tattoo?

853
01:34:04.431 --> 01:34:05.724 line:82%
-Leave it, man!
-Left it, left it.

854
01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:07.684 line:82%
Who am I to catch you anyway?

855
01:34:12.439 --> 01:34:14.691 line:82%
Bloody bitch!
I should have given her one tight slap

856
01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:16.443 line:82%
and she'd be dancing all her life.

857
01:34:18.278 --> 01:34:20.030 line:82%
Taani partner, can I say something?

858
01:34:20.113 --> 01:34:22.074 line:82%
Abusing doesn't suit you.

859
01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:23.241 line:82%
When did I abuse?

860
01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:27.371 line:82%
You just said b for bitch.

861
01:34:27.454 --> 01:34:29.164 line:82%
I know C, D, F as well.
Wanna hear?

862
01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:31.083 line:82%
No, no thank you.
This is enough for today.

863
01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:32.751 line:82%
I had no idea--

864
01:34:37.381 --> 01:34:38.590 line:82%
Move it.

865
01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.426 line:82%
What are you doing?

866
01:34:41.968 --> 01:34:43.804 line:82%
They've gone. Let it go.

867
01:34:46.473 --> 01:34:50.268 line:82%
Son of a gun, take it easy, man.

868
01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.403 line:82%
There they are.

869
01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:02.447 line:82%
No, that's a different couple.

870
01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:11.415 line:82%
Dolly, bitch.

871
01:35:18.088 --> 01:35:19.339 line:82%
I'll show you now.

872
01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:31.184 line:82%
What is happening?
Taani!

873
01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:39.359 line:82%
Raj, get off.

874
01:35:39.443 --> 01:35:41.445 line:82%
Please come.
Let's hang together.

875
01:35:42.779 --> 01:35:44.281 line:82%
You turned out pretty smart.

876
01:36:09.723 --> 01:36:11.766 line:82%
I'm ready, Taani partner,

877
01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:14.311 line:82%
but what's the plan?

878
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:54.184 line:82%
Tiny, I suggest you mess with people
your own size next time.

879
01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:56.645 line:82%
And Dolly, dance now!

880
01:36:57.729 --> 01:36:59.689 line:82%
Hell with Tiny!

881
01:37:03.026 --> 01:37:05.820 line:82%
Taani partner, you are Dhoom 3.

882
01:37:06.655 --> 01:37:09.241 line:82%
My best friend's brother
had a bike,

883
01:37:09.324 --> 01:37:11.368 line:82%
and we used to steal
and ride it every night.

884
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:12.285 line:82%
Great!

885
01:37:12.369 --> 01:37:13.703 line:82%
I have three years of practice.

886
01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:15.705 line:82%
Any more surprises, Taani partner?

887
01:37:15.789 --> 01:37:17.791 line:82%
You won't fly away
like Superman, right?

888
01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:21.545 line:82%
I have only been waiting and watching.

889
01:37:25.215 --> 01:37:26.883 line:82%
So your wife was riding the bike?

890
01:37:27.676 --> 01:37:28.760 line:82%
Yes.

891
01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:31.179 line:82%
That too at the speed of 120?

892
01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.098 line:82%
Yes.

893
01:37:34.391 --> 01:37:35.725 line:82%
And what were you doing?

894
01:37:36.309 --> 01:37:38.019 line:82%
I was sitting behind her.

895
01:37:39.938 --> 01:37:41.147 line:82%
What were you doing behind her?

896
01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:43.441 line:82%
I had to hold the handbag, right?

897
01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:45.694 line:82%
Man! A lady is riding the bike,

898
01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:48.154 line:82%
and you are sitting behind
holding a ladies' handbag.

899
01:37:48.238 --> 01:37:50.115 line:82%
You have spoilt
the whole macho image.

900
01:37:51.616 --> 01:37:55.412 line:82%
Sorry, Bobby,
which part of the bike is macho.

901
01:37:58.707 --> 01:37:59.791 line:82%
Is it very expensive?

902
01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:02.752 line:82%
Man it's not a bike part,
it's a man's part.

903
01:38:03.253 --> 01:38:04.796 line:82%
You, come with me.

904
01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:08.466 line:82%
Why do men ride bikes?
To look macho.

905
01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:10.218 line:82%
Why do they wear jeans?

906
01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:11.678 line:82%
To look macho.

907
01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:13.305 line:82%
But who is this macho?

908
01:38:13.388 --> 01:38:16.516 line:82%
Macho means manhood.

909
01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:20.020 line:82%
They show in films, right,
that if heroines don't listen,

910
01:38:20.103 --> 01:38:21.521 line:82%
the heroes just pick them up
and take them.

911
01:38:21.605 --> 01:38:23.023 line:82%
That is macho.

912
01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:26.109 line:82%
Our action king Dharmendra is macho.

913
01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:29.529 line:82%
Our Stallone Rambo is macho.

914
01:38:29.738 --> 01:38:32.991 line:82%
And you are sitting behind
holding a bag,

915
01:38:33.074 --> 01:38:34.659 line:82%
you destroyed everything macho.

916
01:38:34.743 --> 01:38:37.329 line:82%
But now how can I rectify this macho?

917
01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:40.040 line:82%
To start with,
never sit on the backseat,

918
01:38:40.665 --> 01:38:42.167 line:82%
whether it is the bike
or your house.

919
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.711 line:82%
The handle must always be
in your hands,

920
01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:48.340 line:82%
otherwise your wife
will never respect you.

921
01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:50.508 line:82%
And when you walk,

922
01:38:50.592 --> 01:38:53.386 line:82%
you must swell your chest
high like this.

923
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:55.490 line:82%
Hey, Bobby.

924
01:39:55.573 --> 01:39:57.033 line:82%
What , macho man?

925
01:39:57.117 --> 01:40:00.453 line:82%
Girls are tying rakhi all around here.

926
01:40:00.537 --> 01:40:02.414 line:82%
Every girl is making her partner
her brother.

927
01:40:03.123 --> 01:40:05.875 line:82%
What if Taani gets into the mood
to do the same?

928
01:40:07.252 --> 01:40:09.379 line:82%
Do one thing.
Go hide in the bathroom.

929
01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:10.547 line:82%
That's exactly where I am.

930
01:40:10.672 --> 01:40:11.756 line:82%
Even I have that much intelligence.

931
01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.091 line:82%
But now what do I do?

932
01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:15.719 line:82%
Do anything but just don't come out.

933
01:40:16.344 --> 01:40:19.264 line:82%
You can die
but you cannot let her tie the rakhi.

934
01:40:19.347 --> 01:40:21.516 line:82%
Okay, best of luck, buddy!

935
01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:26.020 line:82%
Raj!

936
01:40:27.105 --> 01:40:28.565 line:82%
Raj, are you inside?

937
01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:31.526 line:82%
Yes, I am here.

938
01:40:32.736 --> 01:40:35.071 line:82%
My stomach doesn't feel good.

939
01:40:35.989 --> 01:40:37.699 line:82%
So I won't be able to dance.

940
01:40:37.866 --> 01:40:40.952 line:82%
I have diarrhea, I am afraid.

941
01:40:41.244 --> 01:40:42.370 line:82%
Oh okay,

942
01:40:42.454 --> 01:40:44.372 line:82%
so then, we'll shop
for costumes today.

943
01:40:44.456 --> 01:40:47.083 line:82%
Anyway, nobody seems to be interested
in dancing here

944
01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:51.379 line:82%
Is it irritating you?

945
01:40:51.463 --> 01:40:53.047 line:82%
In that case, I'll just be out.

946
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:05.268 line:82%
The festival of Rakhi
has been made into a joke in this country.

947
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:07.479 line:82%
Wherever you go,
everyone is tying Rakhi.

948
01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:09.439 line:82%
Just so that people
don't make any wrong notions

949
01:41:09.522 --> 01:41:10.857 line:82%
about a boy and girl relationship.

950
01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:13.651 line:82%
Can't a boy and girl just be friends,

951
01:41:13.735 --> 01:41:15.403 line:82%
can't they be professional partners?

952
01:41:15.487 --> 01:41:17.864 line:82%
10 on 10 correct, Taani partner.

953
01:41:18.323 --> 01:41:20.867 line:82%
But actually, it's the girls
who are responsible for this charade.

954
01:41:21.409 --> 01:41:22.702 line:82%
Given a choice,

955
01:41:22.786 --> 01:41:24.871 line:82%
no boy would ever make
a girl his sister.

956
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:27.248 line:82%
Now look at Tiny and Dolly itself.

957
01:41:27.457 --> 01:41:29.083 line:82%
Till yesterday, we thought

958
01:41:29.167 --> 01:41:31.920 line:82%
that they were girlfriend
and boyfriend, right?

959
01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:35.173 line:82%
But just today Dolly tied a huge rakhi
on Tiny's hand.

960
01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:37.342 line:82%
Poor chap, he was crying. Boohoo.

961
01:41:37.801 --> 01:41:40.804 line:82%
What do the poor guys do?

962
01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:44.015 line:82%
These girls don't even say
what they really want.

963
01:41:44.474 --> 01:41:47.268 line:82%
No girl wants a bodyguard
in the name of a boyfriend,

964
01:41:47.352 --> 01:41:49.604 line:82%
who does nothing but goes around
showing his muscles like some macho.

965
01:41:50.563 --> 01:41:51.564 line:82%
Here. Try these.

966
01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:55.944 line:82%
What, no macho?
But Bobby--

967
01:41:56.694 --> 01:41:57.737 line:82%
Raj.

968
01:41:57.821 --> 01:41:59.864 line:82%
-Yes, am here.
-Come on, let's go.

969
01:42:09.123 --> 01:42:11.167 line:82%
I am confused.

970
01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:13.503 line:82%
Why? Is the size not right?

971
01:42:13.586 --> 01:42:15.129 line:82%
No, no not in the clothes.

972
01:42:16.005 --> 01:42:19.634 line:82%
There is some confusion
in my mind and heart.

973
01:42:20.885 --> 01:42:22.011 line:82%
What confusion?

974
01:42:25.682 --> 01:42:28.601 line:82%
Taani partner, tell me one thing

975
01:42:29.561 --> 01:42:33.064 line:82%
what does a girl really want?

976
01:42:39.821 --> 01:42:41.531 line:82%
You've asked
a very difficult question.

977
01:42:43.575 --> 01:42:47.912 line:82%
The answer to what a girl wants
can be understood only by a girl.

978
01:42:48.037 --> 01:42:49.539 line:82%
I have to become a girl now?

979
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:52.041 line:82%
The answer is very simple

980
01:42:52.959 --> 01:42:56.212 line:82%
but by the time a guy understands it,
both of them turn old.

981
01:42:56.296 --> 01:42:57.672 line:82%
No, Taani partner,

982
01:42:57.755 --> 01:42:59.591 line:82%
please explain it to me
in a shorter way.

983
01:43:00.216 --> 01:43:06.055 line:82%
I don't want to turn old alone.

984
01:43:11.227 --> 01:43:16.983 line:82%
The only thing a girl desires
is that someone loves her

985
01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:21.029 line:82%
like no one has ever
been loved before.

986
01:43:26.784 --> 01:43:32.415 line:82%
There is nothing else
a girl wants from life.

987
01:43:45.929 --> 01:43:47.055 line:82%
So now you understand?

988
01:43:47.305 --> 01:43:50.725 line:82%
If Dolly thought
Tiny loved her like this,

989
01:43:51.476 --> 01:43:53.227 line:82%
she would have
never tied him a rakhi.

990
01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:55.104 line:82%
Come on now, let's go.

991
01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:06.991 line:82%
Suri loves you even more
than you can imagine, Taani.

992
01:44:08.868 --> 01:44:10.495 line:82%
But you are just
not being able to see it.

993
01:44:13.081 --> 01:44:14.332 line:82%
Never mind,

994
01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:20.880 line:82%
now Raj will show Suri's love to you.

995
01:44:40.525 --> 01:44:43.361 line:82%
Taani partner, tomorrow is my birthday.

996
01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:45.154 line:82%
-Wow.
-Thank you.

997
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:49.158 line:82%
I wanted to spend the whole day with you,
what say.

998
01:44:49.492 --> 01:44:51.661 line:82%
Full day? I don't think--

999
01:44:57.583 --> 01:45:00.628 line:82%
So today I am asking you for my prize
and you can't say no.

1000
01:45:02.338 --> 01:45:03.673 line:82%
And anyway, Taani partner,

1001
01:45:04.799 --> 01:45:06.759 line:82%
every year,
I spend this day alone.

1002
01:45:07.468 --> 01:45:09.762 line:82%
So I thought let's do something different
this year.

1003
01:45:11.347 --> 01:45:12.515 line:82%
But I don't--

1004
01:45:12.598 --> 01:45:14.142 line:82%
Now don't tell me

1005
01:45:14.767 --> 01:45:16.978 line:82%
you will have to tie a rakhi on my hand
to spend the day with me.

1006
01:45:23.401 --> 01:45:26.237 line:82%
All right, Raj partner,
tomorrow, the whole day is yours.

1007
01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.156 line:82%
Way to go!

1008
01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:31.117 line:82%
I will pick you at 9 am tomorrow,
Amritsar time.

1009
01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:35.830 line:82%
We are traveling the love lane,
down the road, we will meet again.

1010
01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:06.110 line:82%
You are my heaven

1011
01:46:06.444 --> 01:46:08.905 line:82%
My final tryst

1012
01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:11.908 line:82%
You are my prayer

1013
01:46:12.158 --> 01:46:15.119 line:82%
My soul's bliss

1014
01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:18.081 line:82%
You are the calm that I seek

1015
01:46:18.164 --> 01:46:20.833 line:82%
You are in every heart beat

1016
01:46:20.917 --> 01:46:23.795 line:82%
I know nothing else

1017
01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:26.839 line:82%
Now except

1018
01:46:26.923 --> 01:46:29.884 line:82%
I see my God in you

1019
01:46:29.967 --> 01:46:32.762 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1020
01:46:32.845 --> 01:46:35.640 line:82%
I see my God in you

1021
01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:38.434 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1022
01:46:38.518 --> 01:46:41.187 line:82%
I can't help but bow before you

1023
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:44.023 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1024
01:46:44.107 --> 01:46:46.776 line:82%
I see my God in you

1025
01:46:46.859 --> 01:46:50.988 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1026
01:47:17.974 --> 01:47:20.518 line:82%
So far apart somehow

1027
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:22.770 line:82%
I'm helpless now

1028
01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:28.276 line:82%
But I touch you with my gaze

1029
01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:30.736 line:82%
Your scent

1030
01:47:32.155 --> 01:47:34.157 line:82%
Your words

1031
01:47:34.323 --> 01:47:39.412 line:82%
I'm in paradise in a daze

1032
01:47:40.163 --> 01:47:42.832 line:82%
You're the light inside my heart

1033
01:47:42.915 --> 01:47:45.751 line:82%
You're the treasure I'd never part

1034
01:47:45.835 --> 01:47:48.838 line:82%
I know nothing else

1035
01:47:48.921 --> 01:47:51.841 line:82%
Now except

1036
01:47:51.924 --> 01:47:54.719 line:82%
I see my God in you

1037
01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:57.722 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1038
01:47:57.805 --> 01:48:00.266 line:82%
I see my God in you

1039
01:48:00.349 --> 01:48:03.102 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1040
01:48:03.186 --> 01:48:05.980 line:82%
I can't help but bow before you

1041
01:48:06.063 --> 01:48:08.733 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1042
01:48:08.816 --> 01:48:11.736 line:82%
I see my God in you

1043
01:48:11.819 --> 01:48:16.324 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1044
01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:36.093 line:82%
It's a match

1045
01:48:36.719 --> 01:48:42.099 line:82%
Made by God

1046
01:48:54.111 --> 01:48:56.030 line:82%
With anklets that ring

1047
01:48:56.864 --> 01:48:58.616 line:82%
Leave me longing

1048
01:48:59.116 --> 01:49:04.080 line:82%
Your shadow teases with its touch

1049
01:49:05.331 --> 01:49:07.208 line:82%
When you go by

1050
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:10.127 line:82%
Smiling so shy

1051
01:49:10.586 --> 01:49:15.383 line:82%
Even my God can't take so much

1052
01:49:16.259 --> 01:49:18.886 line:82%
You are that shine

1053
01:49:18.970 --> 01:49:21.847 line:82%
My light divine

1054
01:49:21.931 --> 01:49:24.809 line:82%
I know nothing else

1055
01:49:24.892 --> 01:49:27.937 line:82%
Now except

1056
01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:30.856 line:82%
I see my God in you

1057
01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:33.484 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1058
01:49:33.567 --> 01:49:36.404 line:82%
I see my God in you

1059
01:49:36.487 --> 01:49:39.156 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1060
01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:41.867 line:82%
I can't help but bow before you

1061
01:49:41.951 --> 01:49:44.954 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1062
01:49:45.037 --> 01:49:47.832 line:82%
I see my God in you

1063
01:49:47.915 --> 01:49:51.252 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1064
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:12.606 line:82%
It's a match

1065
01:50:12.815 --> 01:50:16.777 line:82%
Made by God

1066
01:50:30.249 --> 01:50:31.292 line:82%
Hey Khanna, ready, steady go...

1067
01:51:41.779 --> 01:51:42.696 line:82%
This.

1068
01:51:43.572 --> 01:51:44.824 line:82%
What is this, Raj?

1069
01:51:46.450 --> 01:51:48.160 line:82%
It's love, Taani partner,

1070
01:51:48.244 --> 01:51:50.162 line:82%
swear to God, it's true love.

1071
01:51:52.415 --> 01:51:54.542 line:82%
See, I am a rough tough guy.

1072
01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:55.960 line:82%
Had I gone to express my love
through words,

1073
01:51:56.043 --> 01:51:57.294 line:82%
something stupid
would have come out.

1074
01:51:57.378 --> 01:52:00.923 line:82%
So I thought let me get the whole
of Amritsar to express my love,

1075
01:52:03.050 --> 01:52:06.429 line:82%
Did you not like it?

1076
01:52:08.305 --> 01:52:09.557 line:82%
Like it!

1077
01:52:10.641 --> 01:52:14.061 line:82%
Every girl dreams that someone
loves her this madly.

1078
01:52:15.396 --> 01:52:18.149 line:82%
But this kind of madness
no girl can even dream of.

1079
01:52:20.025 --> 01:52:21.318 line:82%
I really liked it, Raj,

1080
01:52:22.361 --> 01:52:23.779 line:82%
but at the same time,
I am feeling sad.

1081
01:52:25.823 --> 01:52:26.949 line:82%
I have made a huge mistake.

1082
01:52:28.075 --> 01:52:31.912 line:82%
I should have told you
that I am a married girl, Raj.

1083
01:52:34.582 --> 01:52:39.670 line:82%
I know everything,
his name is Surinder Sahni

1084
01:52:39.753 --> 01:52:44.175 line:82%
and he works for Punjab Power
and you reside at B-52 Hussain Pura.

1085
01:52:44.258 --> 01:52:46.260 line:82%
I know everything.

1086
01:52:48.387 --> 01:52:51.056 line:82%
But I did not do all this
with any wrong expectations,

1087
01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:52.183 line:82%
no, absolutely not.

1088
01:52:52.808 --> 01:52:57.188 line:82%
I just wanted you to know
how special you are to me.

1089
01:52:58.856 --> 01:53:02.026 line:82%
And you don't worry,
nothing has changed between us

1090
01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:05.029 line:82%
we were friends
and we will remain friends

1091
01:53:05.488 --> 01:53:07.615 line:82%
the only difference
is that you are married

1092
01:53:07.698 --> 01:53:10.201 line:82%
and I will get married
somehow someday.

1093
01:53:10.534 --> 01:53:12.411 line:82%
Nothing has changed,

1094
01:53:13.662 --> 01:53:16.081 line:82%
everything is the same.

1095
01:53:18.167 --> 01:53:19.126 line:82%
No, Raj,

1096
01:53:21.128 --> 01:53:22.505 line:82%
everything has changed.

1097
01:53:29.136 --> 01:53:32.014 line:82%
When a girl begins to dream
with open eyes,

1098
01:53:33.474 --> 01:53:35.226 line:82%
then her whole world changes.

1099
01:53:37.186 --> 01:53:38.729 line:82%
Nothing remains the same after that.

1100
01:53:47.738 --> 01:53:49.406 line:82%
Please leave, Raj.

1101
01:53:51.659 --> 01:53:53.536 line:82%
I want to be here alone for sometime.

1102
01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.288 line:82%
Please.

1103
01:54:45.296 --> 01:54:48.591 line:82%
Suri, I think it's enough now.

1104
01:54:48.674 --> 01:54:53.637 line:82%
Now put an end to this double role
and tell her the truth.

1105
01:54:53.929 --> 01:54:56.432 line:82%
No, buddy, not now.

1106
01:54:57.224 --> 01:54:58.601 line:82%
But why not?

1107
01:55:02.271 --> 01:55:04.064 line:82%
Because I want to know

1108
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:10.029 line:82%
whether she loves Raj or Suri.

1109
01:55:10.529 --> 01:55:13.198 line:82%
Come on, buddy!
They are both the same.

1110
01:55:13.282 --> 01:55:15.993 line:82%
Whoever she loves,
she'll be loving you only.

1111
01:55:19.371 --> 01:55:21.790 line:82%
But she does not know
they are the same, right?

1112
01:55:23.250 --> 01:55:25.419 line:82%
For her, there is a lot of difference
between them.

1113
01:55:27.296 --> 01:55:28.756 line:82%
Suri is her husband

1114
01:55:30.132 --> 01:55:34.720 line:82%
and Raj is nobody.

1115
01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.227 line:82%
In that case,
there is another difference.

1116
01:55:44.271 --> 01:55:49.568 line:82%
Raj expresses his love for her,
loud and clear.

1117
01:55:51.278 --> 01:55:52.488 line:82%
And Suri,

1118
01:55:53.238 --> 01:55:55.783 line:82%
keeps his love shut
in his lunch box.

1119
01:55:58.827 --> 01:56:01.455 line:82%
Buddy, nobody here is God,

1120
01:56:01.538 --> 01:56:03.207 line:82%
all of us are human

1121
01:56:03.457 --> 01:56:05.584 line:82%
and humans are hungry for love.

1122
01:56:05.876 --> 01:56:08.671 line:82%
We get pulled wherever we find love.

1123
01:56:10.089 --> 01:56:12.424 line:82%
You are being unfair
to your wife, Suri.

1124
01:56:12.508 --> 01:56:15.010 line:82%
On one hand, as Raj,
you are showing her heaven

1125
01:56:15.219 --> 01:56:18.222 line:82%
and on the other hand, as Suri,
you show her your grandfather's cottage.

1126
01:56:18.681 --> 01:56:22.976 line:82%
Buddy, show her Suri's love

1127
01:56:23.268 --> 01:56:26.689 line:82%
and then see she'll never even look
at another Raj.

1128
01:56:29.566 --> 01:56:31.276 line:82%
Bobby, my friend,

1129
01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:34.905 line:82%
to make Taani laugh,

1130
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.782 line:82%
to keep her happy,

1131
01:56:36.865 --> 01:56:40.494 line:82%
Suri can do comedy,
Suri can dance,

1132
01:56:40.577 --> 01:56:43.622 line:82%
Suri can change himself completely
and become Raj.

1133
01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.917 line:82%
But to win her love,

1134
01:56:48.252 --> 01:56:49.670 line:82%
Suri won't change.

1135
01:56:51.755 --> 01:56:56.593 line:82%
She will have to love this "Suri,
I work for Punjab Power" for who he is.

1136
01:56:58.262 --> 01:57:02.641 line:82%
And she will have to understand
Suri's love soft, sweet, slow.

1137
01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:08.230 line:82%
Otherwise, we are
traveling the love lane,

1138
01:57:09.523 --> 01:57:10.941 line:82%
down the road,

1139
01:57:13.152 --> 01:57:14.570 line:82%
we will meet again.

1140
01:57:23.912 --> 01:57:25.080 line:82%
Oh God!

1141
01:57:25.497 --> 01:57:29.042 line:82%
Why are you adding spice
to his sugar sweet love story?

1142
01:57:59.531 --> 01:58:01.408 line:82%
So, how is your dance practice going?

1143
01:58:05.662 --> 01:58:08.165 line:82%
And how is your partner,

1144
01:58:09.583 --> 01:58:10.876 line:82%
what was his name?

1145
01:58:24.348 --> 01:58:26.767 line:82%
So, is this Mr. Raj married?

1146
01:58:32.606 --> 01:58:33.649 line:82%
No, he isn't.

1147
01:58:50.707 --> 01:58:54.419 line:82%
I have got two passes for a trade fair
from the company.

1148
01:58:55.587 --> 01:58:56.755 line:82%
Tomorrow is Sunday,

1149
01:58:58.173 --> 01:58:59.925 line:82%
would you like to go?

1150
01:59:01.844 --> 01:59:02.928 line:82%
Yes.

1151
01:59:47.764 --> 01:59:50.642 line:82%
Hi, hello, hope you're fine.

1152
01:59:50.726 --> 01:59:53.729 line:82%
This game here will blow your mind.

1153
01:59:53.812 --> 01:59:58.150 line:82%
If you're not here, it's your loss.

1154
01:59:58.233 --> 02:00:00.152 line:82%
And to all who are here,
at this Japan fun fair.

1155
02:00:00.235 --> 02:00:01.445 line:82%
Welcome.

1156
02:00:01.528 --> 02:00:06.742 line:82%
We have for you, imported specially
from Japan, Mr. Sumo!

1157
02:00:06.825 --> 02:00:10.537 line:82%
If you can last ten minutes in the ring,

1158
02:00:10.621 --> 02:00:13.999 line:82%
you will win two return tickets to Japan.

1159
02:00:14.082 --> 02:00:15.876 line:82%
So I ask you,
where is the son of this soil,

1160
02:00:15.959 --> 02:00:18.462 line:82%
who can make this warrior toil?

1161
02:00:18.587 --> 02:00:21.590 line:82%
Come on, my hero.

1162
02:00:21.673 --> 02:00:23.842 line:82%
Smash him down to zero.

1163
02:00:28.472 --> 02:00:32.517 line:82%
If there's someone here
who had a love in Japan

1164
02:00:32.601 --> 02:00:35.729 line:82%
tripped up, lost out,
failed in his plan,

1165
02:00:36.104 --> 02:00:39.149 line:82%
here's your chance
to make her smile.

1166
02:00:39.232 --> 02:00:43.570 line:82%
Win two return tickets,
go the extra mile.

1167
02:00:43.654 --> 02:00:49.034 line:82%
Is there a braveheart here

1168
02:00:50.035 --> 02:00:54.247 line:82%
who can blow this monster
to little bits?

1169
02:01:14.476 --> 02:01:17.396 line:82%
So we have here,
an Amritsar hound

1170
02:01:17.479 --> 02:01:20.065 line:82%
who'll bring this sumo wrestler
down to the ground.

1171
02:01:20.691 --> 02:01:22.025 line:82%
Your name, please?

1172
02:01:22.651 --> 02:01:23.694 line:82%
Surinder Sahni.

1173
02:01:23.777 --> 02:01:25.362 line:82%
Dear brothers and sisters...

1174
02:01:25.445 --> 02:01:29.658 line:82%
put your hands together
for Mr. Surinder Sahni.

1175
02:01:34.538 --> 02:01:37.624 line:82%
Buddy, are you sure?

1176
02:01:39.543 --> 02:01:40.585 line:82%
Yes.

1177
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:42.921 line:82%
Then why delay further?

1178
02:01:43.005 --> 02:01:45.215 line:82%
Just walk this way.

1179
02:02:32.637 --> 02:02:35.140 line:82%
Sir, you said you were sure,
so fight now.

1180
02:02:35.474 --> 02:02:38.727 line:82%
This is wrong, Sir.

1181
02:02:40.687 --> 02:02:42.355 line:82%
Let go.

1182
02:03:23.355 --> 02:03:25.816 line:82%
The line is out.
The line is out.

1183
02:05:58.385 --> 02:06:00.136 line:82%
It's a miracle.

1184
02:06:03.098 --> 02:06:05.725 line:82%
Mr. Sumo's been flung to the ground.

1185
02:06:05.809 --> 02:06:08.645 line:82%
It's a resounding victory
for Punjab in this round.

1186
02:06:09.479 --> 02:06:13.316 line:82%
And Mr. Surinder Sahni
has won himself

1187
02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:18.071 line:82%
two round trip tickets to Japan
from Amadeus, your technology partner,

1188
02:06:18.154 --> 02:06:19.531 line:82%
absolutely free!

1189
02:07:11.916 --> 02:07:13.209 line:82%
What was this drama?

1190
02:07:14.753 --> 02:07:16.338 line:82%
What was the need
for you to do this?

1191
02:07:18.173 --> 02:07:21.843 line:82%
Aren't you aware that
you are an average working class man,

1192
02:07:22.385 --> 02:07:24.095 line:82%
who everyday puts on his glasses,

1193
02:07:24.179 --> 02:07:27.474 line:82%
sits in a 4 by 4 cubicle
and works in front of a computer.

1194
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:29.559 line:82%
You are not a hero

1195
02:07:29.642 --> 02:07:31.811 line:82%
to go and fight with someone
four times your size.

1196
02:07:32.812 --> 02:07:34.939 line:82%
What were you trying to prove?

1197
02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:42.447 line:82%
Please tell me what was
the need to do all this?

1198
02:07:43.907 --> 02:07:45.950 line:82%
You were very quiet at the fair.

1199
02:07:47.243 --> 02:07:50.038 line:82%
Only at the Japan stall,
you showed some interest.

1200
02:07:50.914 --> 02:07:53.666 line:82%
I knew with my salary,
you'd never be able to see Japan.

1201
02:07:54.376 --> 02:07:56.086 line:82%
I thought that if I could win,

1202
02:07:56.294 --> 02:07:59.047 line:82%
you'd be able to see Japan
and feel happy.

1203
02:07:59.589 --> 02:08:02.509 line:82%
Please stop worrying
about my happiness.

1204
02:08:02.926 --> 02:08:03.927 line:82%
I am happy,

1205
02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:06.513 line:82%
but I can't keep laughing
all the time.

1206
02:08:07.555 --> 02:08:10.850 line:82%
If I am quiet,
it doesn't mean I'm not happy

1207
02:08:11.643 --> 02:08:14.813 line:82%
and if I want something,
I will ask you for it.

1208
02:08:18.191 --> 02:08:21.069 line:82%
You have already done enough for me.

1209
02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:23.822 line:82%
Please don't do so much

1210
02:08:23.905 --> 02:08:26.074 line:82%
that I am never able
to pay you back all my life.

1211
02:08:28.618 --> 02:08:29.452 line:82%
Please,

1212
02:08:31.037 --> 02:08:32.705 line:82%
don't do anything more for me.

1213
02:08:47.095 --> 02:08:49.264 line:82%
I was not doing you a favor, Taani,

1214
02:08:50.056 --> 02:08:51.641 line:82%
I was just loving you.

1215
02:08:54.394 --> 02:08:56.271 line:82%
And love can never be paid back.

1216
02:10:23.942 --> 02:10:25.818 line:82%
Hey Suri, look who is here.

1217
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:27.362 line:82%
Just look now!

1218
02:10:30.323 --> 02:10:33.284 line:82%
That day's dinner was just amazing.

1219
02:10:33.368 --> 02:10:36.704 line:82%
The tandoori chicken you made
was out of this world.

1220
02:10:49.717 --> 02:10:52.262 line:82%
Okay, let's get back to work, good day.

1221
02:10:57.141 --> 02:10:59.769 line:82%
You forgot this.

1222
02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:25.878 line:82%
Actually--

1223
02:11:26.588 --> 02:11:27.505 line:82%
I wanted to say--

1224
02:11:29.507 --> 02:11:31.134 line:82%
There is a new film playing at Rialto,

1225
02:11:33.428 --> 02:11:34.887 line:82%
would you like to see it?

1226
02:11:35.972 --> 02:11:38.391 line:82%
All right, I'll be ready.

1227
02:12:56.302 --> 02:13:00.848 line:82%
Taani partner, I had told you
that you'd miss me.

1228
02:13:00.932 --> 02:13:03.476 line:82%
Looks like Raj's magic
has worked on you.

1229
02:13:03.559 --> 02:13:07.271 line:82%
It's love, Taani partner,
swear to God, it's true love.

1230
02:13:07.355 --> 02:13:09.607 line:82%
Taani partner, close your eyes and

1231
02:13:09.691 --> 02:13:12.652 line:82%
let every raindrop reach your heart

1232
02:14:20.344 --> 02:14:21.554 line:82%
There's nobody inside.

1233
02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:42.909 line:82%
Hello Suri, your wife is here.
She is asking for Raj.

1234
02:14:50.124 --> 02:14:51.167 line:82%
I am coming.

1235
02:16:08.578 --> 02:16:10.955 line:82%
I thought you have
forgotten your partner,

1236
02:16:11.289 --> 02:16:14.375 line:82%
the lights and the I love
you must have scared you a bit?

1237
02:16:14.458 --> 02:16:19.213 line:82%
Forget it all
and drink Punjab's number one tea.

1238
02:16:31.183 --> 02:16:33.185 line:82%
How can you be so happy?

1239
02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.275 line:82%
How can you love me

1240
02:16:40.234 --> 02:16:41.903 line:82%
without expecting love in return?

1241
02:16:45.781 --> 02:16:47.658 line:82%
Don't you feel pain in love?

1242
02:16:49.744 --> 02:16:50.870 line:82%
Pain?

1243
02:16:52.204 --> 02:16:54.540 line:82%
Love is God's gift,

1244
02:16:55.625 --> 02:16:57.293 line:82%
so how can there be pain in love?

1245
02:16:58.502 --> 02:17:00.546 line:82%
Regarding expecting love in return,

1246
02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:03.174 line:82%
one doesn't love
only if the love is reciprocated.

1247
02:17:03.466 --> 02:17:07.678 line:82%
Look, I see God in you,
so I fell in love with you.

1248
02:17:08.179 --> 02:17:10.640 line:82%
You saw God in someone else,
so you fell in love with him.

1249
02:17:10.765 --> 02:17:12.183 line:82%
It's that simple.

1250
02:17:12.892 --> 02:17:15.019 line:82%
Now you should not worry
about all this,

1251
02:17:15.394 --> 02:17:19.398 line:82%
you just drink this hot tea.

1252
02:17:22.944 --> 02:17:25.571 line:82%
My life is not that simple, Raj.

1253
02:17:29.075 --> 02:17:30.534 line:82%
I don't see God in anyone.

1254
02:17:36.582 --> 02:17:37.917 line:82%
I don't see God in anyone.

1255
02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:50.680 line:82%
I had shut all my doors to love.

1256
02:17:53.099 --> 02:17:54.642 line:82%
And then you come along,

1257
02:17:54.725 --> 02:17:56.686 line:82%
laughing, making me laugh,
singing, dancing.

1258
02:17:58.521 --> 02:18:01.899 line:82%
And declared I love you.

1259
02:18:06.696 --> 02:18:08.406 line:82%
From you, I learnt

1260
02:18:09.991 --> 02:18:11.492 line:82%
what true love is.

1261
02:18:13.828 --> 02:18:15.663 line:82%
That there is no pain in true love.

1262
02:18:20.626 --> 02:18:22.920 line:82%
You awakened love in me
once again,

1263
02:18:24.630 --> 02:18:25.756 line:82%
the same love

1264
02:18:26.966 --> 02:18:28.884 line:82%
that I had killed
within me long back.

1265
02:18:31.554 --> 02:18:33.597 line:82%
Why did you come
into my life, Raj?

1266
02:18:36.642 --> 02:18:37.893 line:82%
What do I do now?

1267
02:18:41.063 --> 02:18:42.565 line:82%
I am a married girl.

1268
02:18:46.235 --> 02:18:50.740 line:82%
So now why don't you answer
a very simple question?

1269
02:18:56.203 --> 02:18:57.288 line:82%
What do I do now?

1270
02:19:00.041 --> 02:19:01.333 line:82%
What do I do now?

1271
02:19:12.595 --> 02:19:13.804 line:82%
Run away with me.

1272
02:19:18.684 --> 02:19:20.644 line:82%
If you are not happy with him,

1273
02:19:22.521 --> 02:19:24.315 line:82%
if you don't love him,

1274
02:19:25.566 --> 02:19:27.318 line:82%
then come along with me.

1275
02:19:29.862 --> 02:19:32.198 line:82%
God does not give all of us
equal happiness.

1276
02:19:33.866 --> 02:19:35.451 line:82%
Some of us

1277
02:19:36.619 --> 02:19:40.289 line:82%
have to snatch our share
of happiness from Him.

1278
02:19:45.336 --> 02:19:46.712 line:82%
You also snatch your share.

1279
02:19:50.549 --> 02:19:52.009 line:82%
Run away with me.

1280
02:20:27.128 --> 02:20:28.420 line:82%
Take me away, Raj,

1281
02:20:29.421 --> 02:20:30.506 line:82%
take me away.

1282
02:20:31.423 --> 02:20:33.092 line:82%
I have seen a lot of unhappiness

1283
02:20:33.634 --> 02:20:35.344 line:82%
I can't handle the pain anymore.

1284
02:20:36.804 --> 02:20:39.473 line:82%
I want to be happy,
I want to laugh,

1285
02:20:39.557 --> 02:20:41.725 line:82%
I want to live,
I want to love again.

1286
02:20:42.685 --> 02:20:43.978 line:82%
Take me away Raj,
I can't take it anymore please.

1287
02:20:49.441 --> 02:20:51.527 line:82%
I promise, Taani partner,

1288
02:20:52.403 --> 02:20:54.238 line:82%
that tomorrow,
the night of the competition,

1289
02:20:55.197 --> 02:20:57.283 line:82%
will be our last night
in Amritsar.

1290
02:21:24.727 --> 02:21:26.103 line:82%
I lost, buddy.

1291
02:21:27.938 --> 02:21:29.773 line:82%
I had set out to make Taani happy,

1292
02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:32.776 line:82%
to make my love story a success,

1293
02:21:34.570 --> 02:21:36.155 line:82%
but it's become the end of me.

1294
02:21:36.655 --> 02:21:39.408 line:82%
I just don't understand,

1295
02:21:39.491 --> 02:21:41.660 line:82%
why are you not telling her
the truth now?

1296
02:21:41.744 --> 02:21:43.078 line:82%
Try and understand, man,

1297
02:21:44.496 --> 02:21:45.873 line:82%
when a married woman

1298
02:21:47.875 --> 02:21:49.376 line:82%
especially someone like Taani,

1299
02:21:50.294 --> 02:21:52.546 line:82%
is ready to run away
with someone else,

1300
02:21:54.798 --> 02:21:57.509 line:82%
how unhappy she must be
in her marriage. Just think.

1301
02:22:03.933 --> 02:22:05.601 line:82%
Taani does not love me,

1302
02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:08.020 line:82%
she is not happy with me.

1303
02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:10.731 line:82%
So isn't it my duty to set her free?

1304
02:22:13.234 --> 02:22:14.902 line:82%
So that she can find
her Raj somewhere.

1305
02:22:14.985 --> 02:22:18.030 line:82%
But no Raj will have Suri's heart

1306
02:22:18.113 --> 02:22:21.867 line:82%
and Taani has fallen in love
with that heart, don't you get it?

1307
02:22:21.951 --> 02:22:23.077 line:82%
No, buddy,

1308
02:22:23.953 --> 02:22:26.163 line:82%
if she had fallen in love
with that heart,

1309
02:22:28.290 --> 02:22:30.751 line:82%
she would have understood
what is in Suri's heart.

1310
02:22:32.795 --> 02:22:35.047 line:82%
She would have recognized
Suri's love for her.

1311
02:22:40.386 --> 02:22:42.054 line:82%
I have decided,

1312
02:22:43.597 --> 02:22:45.224 line:82%
tomorrow after the competition,

1313
02:22:46.141 --> 02:22:47.393 line:82%
... I will leave a letter and be gone.

1314
02:22:48.727 --> 02:22:50.396 line:82%
I have put this house on her name

1315
02:22:51.105 --> 02:22:53.774 line:82%
and have requested for a transfer
to the Delhi office.

1316
02:22:54.066 --> 02:22:55.401 line:82%
You have gone mad,

1317
02:22:55.484 --> 02:22:56.735 line:82%
you have gone mad totally.

1318
02:22:56.819 --> 02:22:58.904 line:82%
I am telling her everything.

1319
02:22:58.988 --> 02:23:00.239 line:82%
You have given me your word, Bobby.

1320
02:23:01.407 --> 02:23:02.700 line:82%
You have sworn.

1321
02:23:06.787 --> 02:23:09.039 line:82%
Remember you had stopped me once
by telling me

1322
02:23:10.207 --> 02:23:11.333 line:82%
that this love story,

1323
02:23:11.417 --> 02:23:14.878 line:82%
that this love story
is being written by God.

1324
02:23:18.882 --> 02:23:20.884 line:82%
So now leave the end of this story

1325
02:23:23.304 --> 02:23:24.555 line:82%
to God.

1326
02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:57.796 line:82%
I come here to seek blessings
before every important event in my life.

1327
02:23:59.089 --> 02:24:00.924 line:82%
Today is a big day for you,

1328
02:24:01.925 --> 02:24:05.721 line:82%
so I wanted God to be with you.

1329
02:24:45.761 --> 02:24:49.306 line:82%
God! Wherever
and with whomever Taani may be,

1330
02:24:49.807 --> 02:24:51.016 line:82%
let her be happy

1331
02:24:51.934 --> 02:24:55.020 line:82%
I don't want anything else from you.

1332
02:24:55.687 --> 02:24:57.648 line:82%
He says that he sees God in me,

1333
02:24:58.399 --> 02:25:00.526 line:82%
but I am nothing like you.

1334
02:25:00.984 --> 02:25:02.986 line:82%
In what way do people see you?

1335
02:25:03.821 --> 02:25:05.030 line:82%
Even I want to see you.

1336
02:25:05.656 --> 02:25:07.241 line:82%
Please show me God too.

1337
02:25:07.533 --> 02:25:08.992 line:82%
Please show me God too.

1338
02:25:30.681 --> 02:25:32.558 line:82%
You asked no questions

1339
02:25:33.684 --> 02:25:35.644 line:82%
You asked for nothing

1340
02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:42.151 line:82%
You gave me all
straight from the heart

1341
02:25:43.402 --> 02:25:45.779 line:82%
Didn't say one word

1342
02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:48.449 line:82%
Or judge me

1343
02:25:49.158 --> 02:25:55.080 line:82%
While you gave me all
With a smile

1344
02:25:55.664 --> 02:25:58.792 line:82%
You're my sun, you're my shade

1345
02:25:58.876 --> 02:26:01.879 line:82%
You're my own you'll never fade

1346
02:26:02.171 --> 02:26:05.215 line:82%
I know nothing else

1347
02:26:05.299 --> 02:26:09.052 line:82%
Now all I know is this

1348
02:26:09.136 --> 02:26:12.097 line:82%
I see my God in you

1349
02:26:12.181 --> 02:26:15.392 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1350
02:26:15.476 --> 02:26:18.479 line:82%
I see my God in you

1351
02:26:18.562 --> 02:26:21.690 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1352
02:26:21.773 --> 02:26:24.943 line:82%
I can't help but bow before you

1353
02:26:25.027 --> 02:26:28.071 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1354
02:26:28.197 --> 02:26:31.366 line:82%
I see my God in you

1355
02:26:31.450 --> 02:26:36.622 line:82%
I don't know what to do

1356
02:27:08.654 --> 02:27:11.114 line:82%
So this was couple no. 6.

1357
02:27:11.198 --> 02:27:13.242 line:82%
The judges will now mark them.

1358
02:27:13.325 --> 02:27:14.785 line:82%
Without any further delay,

1359
02:27:14.868 --> 02:27:17.329 line:82%
straight from heaven,
here's couple no. 7.

1360
02:27:17.412 --> 02:27:19.831 line:82%
Please welcome Dolly and Tiny.

1361
02:27:29.132 --> 02:27:30.759 line:82%
I cannot come with you, Raj.

1362
02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:41.478 line:82%
For some time,
your love had made me weak,

1363
02:27:42.688 --> 02:27:44.231 line:82%
it had made me selfish.

1364
02:27:46.316 --> 02:27:47.568 line:82%
I had forgotten

1365
02:27:48.402 --> 02:27:50.153 line:82%
that he had held my hand

1366
02:27:51.446 --> 02:27:53.240 line:82%
when I was all alone.

1367
02:27:54.866 --> 02:27:56.785 line:82%
Now I can't leave his hand.

1368
02:28:06.545 --> 02:28:07.713 line:82%
He is a little boring,

1369
02:28:09.381 --> 02:28:10.757 line:82%
he doesn't speak much.

1370
02:28:12.676 --> 02:28:14.177 line:82%
Looks very simple in his ways,

1371
02:28:14.928 --> 02:28:17.514 line:82%
and is simple in his work
and lifestyle too.

1372
02:28:18.432 --> 02:28:21.560 line:82%
In everything, he is just
a common ordinary man.

1373
02:28:24.146 --> 02:28:25.772 line:82%
But I see God in him.

1374
02:28:34.281 --> 02:28:35.157 line:82%
Yes, Raj,

1375
02:28:35.907 --> 02:28:37.200 line:82%
I see God in him.

1376
02:28:41.663 --> 02:28:43.415 line:82%
It's possible to leave a man

1377
02:28:44.291 --> 02:28:45.959 line:82%
but how does one leave God?

1378
02:28:47.711 --> 02:28:49.630 line:82%
Wherever I may run to,

1379
02:28:50.172 --> 02:28:51.381 line:82%
God will be present.

1380
02:28:53.133 --> 02:28:56.178 line:82%
And wherever there is God,
he will be there.

1381
02:29:00.891 --> 02:29:02.601 line:82%
I can't leave my husband, Raj.

1382
02:29:14.946 --> 02:29:16.156 line:82%
Please forgive me.

1383
02:29:20.285 --> 02:29:21.495 line:82%
Please forgive me.

1384
02:30:06.373 --> 02:30:10.460 line:82%
So, ladies and gentlemen,
that was your couple no. 9.

1385
02:30:10.544 --> 02:30:15.048 line:82%
And now you all must be waiting
to know who is couple no. 10.

1386
02:30:15.382 --> 02:30:17.551 line:82%
So now coming in front of you,

1387
02:30:17.634 --> 02:30:19.845 line:82%
to show their scintillating performance,

1388
02:30:19.928 --> 02:30:21.304 line:82%
is our last couple
of the competition.

1389
02:30:21.388 --> 02:30:25.142 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen
please welcome Miss Taani,

1390
02:30:33.108 --> 02:30:35.986 line:82%
and Mr. Raj.

1391
02:30:48.123 --> 02:30:51.293 line:82%
Wow, nowadays guys
seem to be more shy than girls

1392
02:30:51.376 --> 02:30:54.045 line:82%
the girl is here but the boy isn't,
not a problem.

1393
02:30:54.129 --> 02:30:56.006 line:82%
Let's just try again.

1394
02:30:56.465 --> 02:31:00.927 line:82%
So ladies and gentlemen
please welcome Mr. Raj.

1395
02:31:07.017 --> 02:31:10.270 line:82%
Maybe he is in the bathroom
doing last minute dance practice.

1396
02:31:10.604 --> 02:31:12.355 line:82%
Let's try once again loudly.

1397
02:31:12.647 --> 02:31:15.567 line:82%
So ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome--

1398
02:31:18.445 --> 02:31:20.113 line:82%
My dance partner won't be coming.

1399
02:31:20.655 --> 02:31:22.616 line:82%
Please disqualify us.

1400
02:31:23.784 --> 02:31:24.826 line:82%
Are you sure?

1401
02:33:04.551 --> 02:33:05.760 line:82%
Raj.

1402
02:33:05.844 --> 02:33:07.637 line:82%
You must have heard of me.

1403
02:33:07.721 --> 02:33:10.181 line:82%
Nothing, I have sprained my neck.

1404
02:33:10.265 --> 02:33:14.644 line:82%
I'll be late every night.
I am doing overtime at office.

1405
02:33:14.728 --> 02:33:17.689 line:82%
Your heart wants to stop hurting.

1406
02:33:17.772 --> 02:33:19.733 line:82%
I am sorry I had some trouble
with the car so got late.

1407
02:33:54.059 --> 02:33:56.811 line:82%
And how is your partner,
what was his name?

1408
02:33:56.895 --> 02:34:00.398 line:82%
His name is Surinder Sahni
and he works for Punjab Power.

1409
02:34:27.968 --> 02:34:29.761 line:82%
It's love, Taani partner,

1410
02:34:30.971 --> 02:34:32.931 line:82%
swear to God, it's true love.

1411
02:34:34.474 --> 02:34:36.977 line:82%
I see God in you,
so I fell in love with you.

1412
02:34:38.228 --> 02:34:41.106 line:82%
You saw God in someone else,
so you fell in love with him.

1413
02:35:13.179 --> 02:35:15.056 line:82%
If you are not happy with him,

1414
02:35:18.601 --> 02:35:20.562 line:82%
if you don't love him,

1415
02:35:22.897 --> 02:35:24.566 line:82%
then come along with me.

1416
02:36:19.204 --> 02:36:20.288 line:82%
Lies.

1417
02:36:20.872 --> 02:36:21.915 line:82%
No, Taani.

1418
02:36:22.373 --> 02:36:23.416 line:82%
All lies.

1419
02:36:24.209 --> 02:36:25.251 line:82%
No, no.

1420
02:36:26.044 --> 02:36:27.504 line:82%
You lied to me,

1421
02:36:29.631 --> 02:36:32.092 line:82%
that you don't know
what is love.

1422
02:36:35.970 --> 02:36:37.013 line:82%
All lies.

1423
02:36:40.016 --> 02:36:43.394 line:82%
How easily you turned
all my sadness into joy,

1424
02:36:45.563 --> 02:36:47.482 line:82%
all my tears into laughter.

1425
02:36:51.611 --> 02:36:55.573 line:82%
I did not give you
a single drop of love,

1426
02:36:56.950 --> 02:37:02.705 line:82%
and you just kept showering
your love on me.

1427
02:37:05.416 --> 02:37:08.253 line:82%
How can you love me so much?

1428
02:37:10.505 --> 02:37:12.006 line:82%
It's very simple,

1429
02:37:12.841 --> 02:37:15.426 line:82%
I see God in you.

1430
02:37:16.636 --> 02:37:20.223 line:82%
When I pray to Him,
my heart feels solace.

1431
02:37:21.474 --> 02:37:24.227 line:82%
And when I see you laugh,
I see you happy,

1432
02:37:24.310 --> 02:37:26.980 line:82%
my heart feels even more solace.

1433
02:37:28.106 --> 02:37:29.816 line:82%
Taani, if this is love,

1434
02:37:30.650 --> 02:37:34.571 line:82%
then I love you even more than God.

1435
02:37:48.543 --> 02:37:49.836 line:82%
What's this?

1436
02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:51.921 line:82%
Please don't cry.

1437
02:37:57.552 --> 02:37:59.053 line:82%
-Handkerchief?
-Oh, yes.

1438
02:38:00.513 --> 02:38:02.265 line:82%
I think I forgot it at home.

1439
02:38:07.312 --> 02:38:11.858 line:82%
Taani, I hope God won't be angry with me

1440
02:38:13.067 --> 02:38:16.029 line:82%
that I love you more than him.

1441
02:38:22.076 --> 02:38:24.662 line:82%
No, no.

1442
02:38:25.747 --> 02:38:27.207 line:82%
Then that's the best that can happen.

1443
02:38:31.085 --> 02:38:32.128 line:82%
The best.

1444
02:38:38.927 --> 02:38:43.097 line:82%
So ladies and gentlemen,
this is Amritsar's dancing couple No. 1

1445
02:38:43.181 --> 02:38:45.433 line:82%
Mr. Raj and Ms. Taani.

1446
02:39:00.990 --> 02:39:03.534 line:82%
A new story begins from here.

1447
02:40:07.432 --> 02:40:10.727 line:82%
Like they say,
"All is well that ends well."

1448
02:40:10.810 --> 02:40:13.563 line:82%
After this, it was our honeymoon in Japan.

1449
02:40:16.524 --> 02:40:19.110 line:82%
This is a famous park in Japan.

1450
02:40:19.319 --> 02:40:22.864 line:82%
There's Taani, me
and a Buddha in this picture.

1451
02:40:23.573 --> 02:40:25.575 line:82%
This is the back side of the same park.

1452
02:40:25.700 --> 02:40:27.368 line:82%
This is quite famous, too.

1453
02:40:29.454 --> 02:40:32.749 line:82%
This is one of Japan's famous bridges.

1454
02:40:34.125 --> 02:40:36.669 line:82%
Like they say,
"When in Rome, do as Romans do."

1455
02:40:36.753 --> 02:40:40.840 line:82%
So, Japanese hats, goggles
and even underwear!

1456
02:40:41.549 --> 02:40:44.093 line:82%
Just the kiss is very Indian.

1457
02:40:45.386 --> 02:40:46.721 line:82%
Taani, I tell you.

1458
02:40:49.098 --> 02:40:51.851 line:82%
This is Japan's traditional attire.

1459
02:40:52.185 --> 02:40:56.230 line:82%
They also do yoga and meditation
in this outfit,

1460
02:40:56.314 --> 02:40:57.982 line:82%
just like us Indians.

1461
02:40:59.984 --> 02:41:01.819 line:82%
Not sure why Taani is laughing here.

1462
02:41:01.903 --> 02:41:04.155 line:82%
I don't think
I'm looking that funny.

1463
02:41:04.947 --> 02:41:06.157 line:82%
I think I look fine.

1464
02:41:06.991 --> 02:41:09.786 line:82%
Orange is my second most
favorite color.

1465
02:41:09.869 --> 02:41:11.871 line:82%
You already know
how much I like yellow.

1466
02:41:13.164 --> 02:41:14.957 line:82%
Taani is clinging to me here.

1467
02:41:15.666 --> 02:41:18.002 line:82%
I'm a little shy about these things.

1468
02:41:19.545 --> 02:41:21.005 line:82%
This is Mount Fujiyama.

1469
02:41:21.464 --> 02:41:23.925 line:82%
Used to be an active volcano,
not anymore.

1470
02:41:25.885 --> 02:41:27.720 line:82%
Here it was necessary to hug.

1471
02:41:28.513 --> 02:41:29.931 line:82%
It was very cold.

1472
02:41:30.890 --> 02:41:36.729 line:82%
This is a Japanese sign board
that probably says "Mount Fujiyama."

1473
02:41:38.231 --> 02:41:41.109 line:82%
This sign board says "Shikotsu Lake."

1474
02:41:41.275 --> 02:41:42.777 line:82%
I know this much English.

1475
02:41:42.902 --> 02:41:44.695 line:82%
Taani is being very romantic here.

1476
02:41:45.071 --> 02:41:47.448 line:82%
She became very comfortable
during our trip.

1477
02:41:47.907 --> 02:41:50.451 line:82%
Just so the Japanese
don't stare too much at her short dress,

1478
02:41:50.535 --> 02:41:52.954 line:82%
I sat down in front of her
to cover her legs.

1479
02:41:53.037 --> 02:41:55.164 line:82%
Typical Indian men mentality.

1480
02:41:58.376 --> 02:42:01.170 line:82%
I even visited a famous temple
with Taani.

1481
02:42:02.338 --> 02:42:03.923 line:82%
All Gods are the same, right?

1482
02:42:04.507 --> 02:42:06.175 line:82%
I felt very nice being there.

1483
02:42:09.178 --> 02:42:11.013 line:82%
I'm feeling very shy,

1484
02:42:11.097 --> 02:42:13.433 line:82%
but this was my first public kiss.

1485
02:42:14.976 --> 02:42:16.352 line:82%
We had a lot of fun.

1486
02:42:16.894 --> 02:42:19.605 line:82%
Got dressed and went around town.

1487
02:42:20.523 --> 02:42:22.358 line:82%
We even danced on the streets,

1488
02:42:22.567 --> 02:42:24.152 line:82%
now that I've learned to dance.

1489
02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:30.908 line:82%
We ate, drank, danced,
sang, had lots of fun.

1490
02:42:31.159 --> 02:42:32.535 line:82%
It was a lot of fun.

1491
02:42:32.618 --> 02:42:37.707 line:82%
To tell you the truth, being with Taani
reminded me of my childhood.

1492
02:42:38.249 --> 02:42:39.250 line:82%
Really.

1493
02:42:39.917 --> 02:42:41.419 line:82%
This is Mickey Mouse's hat.

1494
02:42:41.544 --> 02:42:43.754 line:82%
I'm sure you know Mickey.

1495
02:42:45.339 --> 02:42:49.093 line:82%
We even went to snow capped mountains.

1496
02:42:49.302 --> 02:42:53.139 line:82%
I won a snow fight 10-5.

1497
02:42:53.723 --> 02:42:55.766 line:82%
Once, it was a close contest.

1498
02:42:57.810 --> 02:42:59.061 line:82%
It is true,

1499
02:42:59.187 --> 02:43:03.024 line:82%
I got to meet the old, happy,
bubbly Taani.

1500
02:43:03.107 --> 02:43:07.153 line:82%
I became quite happy-go-lucky myself.

1501
02:43:07.570 --> 02:43:09.989 line:82%
I missed Bobby a lot.

1502
02:43:10.114 --> 02:43:12.575 line:82%
Bobby, this hug is for you.

1503
02:43:12.783 --> 02:43:15.786 line:82%
You should have come along
for our honeymoon.

1504
02:43:16.370 --> 02:43:19.081 line:82%
These are our private moments
in the hotel room.

1505
02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:21.334 line:82%
Taani was being very naughty.

1506
02:43:23.044 --> 02:43:25.546 line:82%
She wore my fake mustache
and started complaining

1507
02:43:25.630 --> 02:43:28.883 line:82%
that everything else is fine
but my mustache is a problem.

1508
02:43:29.133 --> 02:43:33.262 line:82%
I said, "Let me find out what it's like
to kiss someone with a mustache."

1509
02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:38.184 line:82%
So, this is Amritsar's No. 1--

1510
02:43:38.643 --> 02:43:41.062 line:82%
No, the world's No. 1 couple.
