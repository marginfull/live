00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.830 line:82%
"You get me golden earrings"

2
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.120 line:82%
"I'll kiss them and
wear them in my ears."

3
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.740 line:82%
"You get me golden earrings"

4
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.200 line:82%
"I'll kiss them and
wear them in my ears."

5
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.660 line:82%
"You get me golden earrings"

6
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.990 line:82%
"I'll kiss them and
wear them in my ears."

7
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.370 line:82%
"Please agree,"
- You call this an arrangement?

8
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.200 line:82%
"Take me shopping..."
- Everything is so dull.

9
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.370 line:82%
Our reputation is at stake.

10
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.040 line:82%
All the guests are
just eating and leaving.

11
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.870 line:82%
At this pace, by the time the ceremony
starts, there will be no guests left.

12
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.700 line:82%
How can you blame the
arrangements for that, sir?

13
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.580 line:82%
Did I ask you to invite boring people?

14
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.910 line:82%
If your guests are irresponsible
and don't care about your respect...

15
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.240 line:82%
How is it my fault?

16
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.080 line:82%
The DJ is blasting his speakers

17
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.620 line:82%
new, old English,
he's got all kinds of songs.

18
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.290 line:82%
But it is your guests
who have to dance, right?

19
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.450 line:82%
This is neither a movie
nor am I Ranveer Singh...

20
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.160 line:82%
...to start dancing at your wedding.

21
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.740 line:82%
Imagine how stupid I
will look dancing over here.

22
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.080 line:82%
The wedding got delayed
because of the beautician.

23
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.580 line:82%
Because at the last
moment Pinky decided...

24
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.740 line:82%
...to go for the platinum
package instead of the gold one.

25
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.950 line:82%
How is that my fault now?

26
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.290 line:82%
We have planned everything
according to the gold package.

27
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.290 line:82%
Tell me if there is anything
lacking in my arrangements.

28
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.950 line:82%
Sir, we are running out of plates.

29
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.950 line:82%
What do you mean?

30
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.580 line:82%
Uncle...

31
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.540 line:82%
Your relatives' sons
are standing right there.

32
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.740 line:82%
I asked them to count before
I placed the plates there.

33
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.950 line:82%
It was you who thought that 700 plates
would be enough for 1200 guests.

34
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.790 line:82%
Others will only hog on snacks.

35
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.790 line:82%
Now make them eat snacks.

36
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.990 line:82%
Okay, don't look so distressed.

37
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.990 line:82%
I will place some more.

38
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.620 line:82%
But I will charge
400 per plate for these.

39
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.660 line:82%
400 per plate?

40
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.990 line:82%
What kind of a person are you?

41
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.830 line:82%
I am charging you 400 instead
of 1400 at the time of your need.

42
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.870 line:82%
If it were someone else,
he would have charged 2000.

43
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.450 line:82%
What now?

44
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.450 line:82%
Sonu!

45
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.040 line:82%
Sonu...

46
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.240 line:82%
Sonu, Pihu...

47
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.740 line:82%
Is she dead?

48
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.410 line:82%
Why are you saying that?

49
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.580 line:82%
I am already crying.

50
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.740 line:82%
Did I make you cry?

51
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.580 line:82%
You can at least stop me.

52
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.410 line:82%
For what?

53
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.620 line:82%
She'll just make you cry again.

54
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.740 line:82%
She makes you cry,
I make you stop.

55
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.740 line:82%
She makes you cry,
I make you stop.

56
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.910 line:82%
She makes you cry,
I make you stop.

57
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.290 line:82%
This girl has this vicious
circle going forever!

58
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.080 line:82%
There is a limit to being stupid!

59
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.290 line:82%
We have been doing nothing
but this since the past two years.

60
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.120 line:82%
You started crying on
the first month anniversary...

61
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.120 line:82%
And you still haven't stopped.

62
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.830 line:82%
She didn't do anything.

63
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.330 line:82%
It is my fault.

64
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.990 line:82%
What an...

65
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.830 line:82%
What's your fault?

66
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.040 line:82%
I checked her Tinder account.

67
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.700 line:82%
You checked her Tinder account,
that's the issue?

68
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.370 line:82%
I apologized to her as well.

69
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.580 line:82%
But she feels that I
don't respect her privacy.

70
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.740 line:82%
And that I doubt her.

71
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.040 line:82%
Please talk to her.

72
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.450 line:82%
You fool, why does she have a
Tinder account in the first place?

73
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.620 line:82%
How does that matter?

74
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.790 line:82%
Talk to her, please.

75
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.290 line:82%
I swear if you weren't
my childhood friend...

76
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.450 line:82%
...I would have disowned you
long back.

77
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.450 line:82%
How did you become such an idiot?

78
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.290 line:82%
People become blind in love,
not stupid in love.

79
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.450 line:82%
I mean, how?

80
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.160 line:82%
I don't even control myself
as much as she controls you.

81
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.990 line:82%
From your food, to clothes,
even our toothpaste is of her choice!

82
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.200 line:82%
We have been using
Colgate since childhood...

83
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.160 line:82%
...and now because of
her 'herbal' nonsense...

84
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.040 line:82%
...my mouth tastes like mud all day.

85
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.040 line:82%
She takes care of us.

86
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.910 line:82%
Otherwise,
you know how I hog at the shop.

87
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.410 line:82%
That's grandpa's kurta, isn't it?

88
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.410 line:82%
Yeah, I flicked it.

89
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.370 line:82%
It's nice, right?

90
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.410 line:82%
Get more kachoris (fried snacks).

91
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.410 line:82%
Okay, sir.

92
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.790 line:82%
It's very nice.

93
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.950 line:82%
You should wear such kurtas,
grandpa types.

94
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.120 line:82%
Why wear t-shirts?

95
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.120 line:82%
They'll have good fit,
make you look young.

96
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.120 line:82%
Yuck!

97
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.160 line:82%
Shouldn't we just
eat kachoris instead?

98
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.950 line:82%
Listen...

99
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.660 line:82%
Also get jalebis (sweets) for him.

100
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.450 line:82%
Okay, ma'am.

101
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.660 line:82%
This is how she takes care?

102
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.870 line:82%
She could have mentioned
health or cholesterol.

103
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.870 line:82%
She could have said that
you'd get a heart attack.

104
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.200 line:82%
But no, she isn't worried
about your health.

105
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.700 line:82%
She is more worried that
if she's seen around with a fat guy...

106
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.240 line:82%
...then her image will get ruined.

107
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.580 line:82%
Hmm?

108
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.580 line:82%
But it means the same.

109
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.950 line:82%
There is way of saying things.

110
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.240 line:82%
Those who have to take
care don't taunt to do so.

111
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.990 line:82%
She manipulates under the
disguise of taking care of you, Titu.

112
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.660 line:82%
She is not at all manipulative.

113
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.830 line:82%
Don't make me say it.

114
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.660 line:82%
I didn't want to go that way,
but let's go there as well.

115
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.540 line:82%
'Scoundrels, no one at the
police station could find my uniform?'

116
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.200 line:82%
'Shame on you!'

117
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.240 line:82%
'Sir, you are the one who is naked.'

118
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.410 line:82%
'Why should we feel ashamed?'

119
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.910 line:82%
'Bloodshot eyes and an officer...'

120
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.240 line:82%
- He means...
- Please.

121
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.790 line:82%
I'm glad I don't understand.

122
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.950 line:82%
She grew up in Jalandhar, right?

123
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.120 line:82%
She attended college in Delhi.

124
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.490 line:82%
Then how can she not know Punjabi?

125
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.660 line:82%
She understands Honey
Singh perfectly well.

126
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.120 line:82%
But she scrunches her nose
when it comes to Malkit Singh.

127
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.950 line:82%
It is all a pretense, Titu.

128
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.160 line:82%
I am telling you, she is a liar.

129
00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.700 line:82%
And that day...

130
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.580 line:82%
Which day?

131
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.910 line:82%
You know very well know which day.

132
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.740 line:82%
Not that.

133
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.740 line:82%
Don't go there.

134
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.540 line:82%
Why not?

135
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.080 line:82%
Because you know that I am right?

136
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.950 line:82%
You will have to come along.

137
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.120 line:82%
Come on.

138
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.950 line:82%
Come on!

139
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.790 line:82%
Hi.

140
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.700 line:82%
Hey, hi.

141
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.700 line:82%
- How are you?
- What's up!

142
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.580 line:82%
Good, good...

143
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.580 line:82%
My friend Sonu.

144
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.740 line:82%
Hi, Anshul.

145
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.040 line:82%
My friend Titu.

146
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.410 line:82%
Hi, Anshul.

147
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.540 line:82%
What's up!

148
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.240 line:82%
And... how are you?

149
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.620 line:82%
Not too bad. You were leaving?

150
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.290 line:82%
No.

151
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.790 line:82%
You know why a girl Introduces
her boyfriend as a friend, right?

152
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.160 line:82%
Don't say anything.

153
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160 line:82%
I am not saying anything.

154
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.990 line:82%
Now her Instagram will do the talking.

155
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.200 line:82%
Where are you in this?

156
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:49.910 line:82%
Where?

157
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.240 line:82%
Tell me.

158
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.080 line:82%
Yeah?

159
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.410 line:82%
Where?

160
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.290 line:82%
Just show it to me.

161
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.790 line:82%
I will shut up.

162
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.120 line:82%
You have even given
her the keys to the shop.

163
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.450 line:82%
She also knows the
code of the cash counter.

164
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.950 line:82%
And she doesn't let you
check her Tinder account?

165
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.160 line:82%
So, what should I do?

166
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.830 line:82%
What do you mean by, what should I do?

167
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.830 line:82%
End it!

168
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.830 line:82%
Call her up and ask
her to return the keys.

169
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.160 line:82%
I will change the code.

170
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.700 line:82%
I should break up
over such a small thing?

171
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.160 line:82%
Small thing?

172
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.700 line:82%
In two years, 24 months, 104 weeks...

173
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.370 line:82%
She has made you cry for a 102 weeks.

174
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.910 line:82%
What kind of a relationship averages
one week of happiness per year?

175
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.740 line:82%
We don't need it, bro we don't need it

176
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.450 line:82%
It is not like that, Sonu.

177
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.620 line:82%
Things will get better.

178
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.290 line:82%
Look, I was hoping
that you would understand.

179
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.620 line:82%
But I have no other option.

180
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.330 line:82%
I can only let you jump
into ditches I can get you out of.

181
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.490 line:82%
I waited for two years.

182
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.660 line:82%
But not anymore.

183
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.870 line:82%
I never wanted to do this in life.

184
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.700 line:82%
But I have no other
option to save you.

185
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.410 line:82%
Think of it this way,
it's either her, or me.

186
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.490 line:82%
"Boy, you don't have
to be the last one standing."

187
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.290 line:82%
"Boy show me,
you could be the one, one, one..."

188
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.490 line:82%
"Look into my eyes...
and come closer."

189
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.830 line:82%
"You wear high heels...
and I am crazy about you."

190
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.370 line:82%
"You make tall claims...
prove it to me."

191
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.790 line:82%
"Come closer, handsome."

192
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.450 line:82%
"I wanna see you
whine like Rihanna..."

193
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.490 line:82%
"Get all the pounder,
Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

194
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.120 line:82%
"She burnin' up like the summer..."

195
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.830 line:82%
"She'd tell me, I'm good
at Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom ."

196
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.830 line:82%
"You've got me like crazy."

197
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.700 line:82%
"That you callin' me..."

198
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.490 line:82%
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

199
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.200 line:82%
"You've got me like crazy."

200
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.540 line:82%
"That you callin' me..."

201
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.200 line:82%
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

202
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:09.740 line:82%
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

203
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.950 line:82%
"Girl, I know you want me..."

204
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.620 line:82%
"It was love at first sight for me."

205
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.490 line:82%
"You know, believe me..."

206
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.490 line:82%
"This is me expressing
my feelings to you."

207
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.490 line:82%
"You went behind my
back and ogled others."

208
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.160 line:82%
"You stole my heart and
then stabbed me in the back."

209
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.870 line:82%
"You talk a lot..."

210
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.700 line:82%
"Let me explain."

211
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.540 line:82%
"Come closer, handsome."

212
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.910 line:82%
"I wanna see you
whine like Rihanna..."

213
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.790 line:82%
"Get all the pounder,
Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

214
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.490 line:82%
"She burnin' up like the summer..."

215
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.160 line:82%
"She'd tell me,
I'm good at Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

216
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.990 line:82%
"You've got me like crazy."

217
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.990 line:82%
"That you callin' me..."

218
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.870 line:82%
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

219
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.700 line:82%
"You've got me like crazy."

220
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.870 line:82%
"That you callin' me..."

221
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.540 line:82%
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

222
00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.240 line:82%
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

223
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.240 line:82%
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

224
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.580 line:82%
"Oh baby, give me one more dance..."

225
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.950 line:82%
"One more dance, one more dance."

226
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.240 line:82%
"Oh baby, we can make it last..."

227
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.660 line:82%
"Make it last, make it last."

228
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.990 line:82%
"Give me girl,
give me just like that..."

229
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.490 line:82%
"Cause you're body's
like a hourglass."

230
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.660 line:82%
"To the left, to the right..."

231
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.040 line:82%
"Everybody in the club...
- Diggy-Diggy Bom Bom."

232
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.370 line:82%
"I wanna see you, I wanna see you..."

233
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.330 line:82%
"I wanna see you
whine like Rihanna..."

234
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.200 line:82%
"Get all the pounder,
Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

235
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.870 line:82%
"She burnin' up like the summer..."

236
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.790 line:82%
"She'd tell me,
I'm good at Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

237
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.580 line:82%
"You've got me like crazy."

238
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.790 line:82%
"That you callin' me..."

239
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.330 line:82%
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

240
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.120 line:82%
"You've got me like crazy."

241
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.490 line:82%
"That you callin' me..."

242
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.660 line:82%
"Bom Diggy-Diggy... Bom Bom!"

243
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.700 line:82%
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

244
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.370 line:82%
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

245
00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:03.240 line:82%
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

246
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.450 line:82%
Just yesterday, I told uncle
that we wouldn't be able to make it...

247
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.330 line:82%
We have a lot of work in Delhi.

248
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.950 line:82%
We will come to Meerut
after four days.

249
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.490 line:82%
Now he'll censure me.

250
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.660 line:82%
"You say you have work
when I ask you to come down."

251
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.200 line:82%
"And you come immediately
when mother asks you to."

252
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.040 line:82%
Don't drink on Tuesdays at least.

253
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.870 line:82%
I didn't.

254
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.990 line:82%
Did you get the lotus stem?

255
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.870 line:82%
He informed me at night.

256
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.040 line:82%
What nonsense is this?

257
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.580 line:82%
Will it be right for Ghasitarams
to take Haldiram's sweets with them?

258
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.740 line:82%
Where are you going?

259
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.740 line:82%
What do you mean?

260
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.620 line:82%
No matter where he is going...

261
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.330 line:82%
It'd never be right for Haldiram
to take Ghasitaram's sweets with him.

262
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.450 line:82%
You are getting the names wrong.

263
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.450 line:82%
I am wrong?

264
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.330 line:82%
You are wrong.

265
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:40.990 line:82%
Tell papa.

266
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.830 line:82%
He is talking about Ghasitaram
taking Haldiram's sweets...

267
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.490 line:82%
...and not the other way around.

268
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.660 line:82%
Obviously.

269
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.040 line:82%
Why would they take ours?

270
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.160 line:82%
Theirs is better.

271
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.540 line:82%
Which side are you on?

272
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.540 line:82%
I am on your side.

273
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.040 line:82%
- We won't take someone else's sweet.
- Right.

274
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.700 line:82%
But papa is also right.

275
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.580 line:82%
The quality of our sweets
has gone down, hasn't it?

276
00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.740 line:82%
That's what brother is saying.

277
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.240 line:82%
When did our quality deteriorate?

278
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.910 line:82%
Your sweets were
never of good quality.

279
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.910 line:82%
It's the same.

280
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.120 line:82%
Just as yours.

281
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.620 line:82%
There was either no quality even then,
or it's there even now.

282
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.740 line:82%
Take that back!

283
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.120 line:82%
Take it back!

284
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.990 line:82%
Rukmani, I will shoot him.

285
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.660 line:82%
You'd compare your
shit with my sweets?

286
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.490 line:82%
I used to make them with my own hands.

287
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.540 line:82%
Confectioners of Mathura used to send
spies to find out how our Pedas were made.

288
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.330 line:82%
And those Alwar's...?

289
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.910 line:82%
Alwar's shopkeepers used to send
men with money to get our recipes.

290
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.200 line:82%
Take that back!

291
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.990 line:82%
Rukmani, tell him to take it back.

292
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.700 line:82%
Otherwise, I will shoot him for real.

293
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.870 line:82%
Okay, I take it back.

294
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.580 line:82%
Yours were better but...

295
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.450 line:82%
Better? The question of better
arises when there's competition

296
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.620 line:82%
- Yours is...
- Lalu...

297
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:47.950 line:82%
Yes.

298
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.120 line:82%
Put Haldiram's sweets
in our box and take them.

299
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.660 line:82%
End this topic now.
Dinner is being served.

300
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.330 line:82%
This is a limit.

301
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.990 line:82%
Why don't we take
chocolate pastry instead?

302
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.660 line:82%
This is what was left to be said.

303
00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.330 line:82%
I will take chocolates with me to go
meet my grandson's prospective wife?

304
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.290 line:82%
Prospective wife?

305
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.160 line:82%
Which grandson?

306
00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.660 line:82%
Titu, you didn't tell him?

307
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.370 line:82%
Surprise.

308
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.540 line:82%
See, I am doing as you said.

309
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.200 line:82%
You asked me to get married,
so I am getting married.

310
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:06.870 line:82%
Are you nuts...

311
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.540 line:82%
He isn't getting married.

312
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:07.990 line:82%
He's just going to meet a girl.

313
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.870 line:82%
There is a prospective match for him.

314
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.040 line:82%
I met 19 girls before
I met your mother.

315
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.540 line:82%
But all of a sudden?

316
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.580 line:82%
You made only rice?

317
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.370 line:82%
Where's the chicken?

318
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.240 line:82%
It's Tuesday.

319
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.240 line:82%
How about cottage
cheese with peas then?

320
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.410 line:82%
You could have made
something more appetizing.

321
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.080 line:82%
Mr. Malhotra got a
heart attack last week.

322
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.410 line:82%
He was just 48 years old.

323
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.080 line:82%
No oily food from today.

324
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.540 line:82%
My stomach is acting weird.

325
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.490 line:82%
Go for a walk?

326
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.740 line:82%
Yes, let's go for a walk.

327
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.910 line:82%
I too will join you.

328
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.740 line:82%
He fed me chickpeas in the evening.

329
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.950 line:82%
I am feeling heavy.

330
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240 line:82%
I will eat after I come back.

331
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.790 line:82%
My stomach is upset as well.

332
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.950 line:82%
Yes, of course, it is upset.

333
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.740 line:82%
I know how you'd react
if I had made mince meat.

334
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.290 line:82%
Let me see how often your stomach
gets upset after you get married.

335
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.290 line:82%
Stay.

336
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.290 line:82%
Bro, I know you have needs.

337
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.160 line:82%
But you don't need
marriage to fulfill them.

338
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.160 line:82%
Needs?

339
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.830 line:82%
Have you lost it?

340
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:57.790 line:82%
No, seriously.

341
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.990 line:82%
There are hundreds of girls who don't
want to be in a serious relationship...

342
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.870 line:82%
And just, you know, want to have fun?

343
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.040 line:82%
How do you think I am surviving?

344
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.490 line:82%
Everyone has needs.

345
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.700 line:82%
Sonu, my darling, I know.

346
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.580 line:82%
I am not getting married for sex.

347
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.200 line:82%
Shall we change the cook?

348
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.580 line:82%
We've already purchased
a new washing machine and dryer.

349
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.620 line:82%
I want to get married,
not open a laundry service.

350
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.790 line:82%
But why do you want get married?

351
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.120 line:82%
I am of the right age to get married.

352
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.620 line:82%
I feel I should have
someone in my life...

353
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.160 line:82%
...who would stay with me,
love me, take care of me.

354
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.450 line:82%
Someone?

355
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.450 line:82%
What about me?

356
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.990 line:82%
Am I not enough?

357
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.370 line:82%
Don't I give you enough love?

358
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.200 line:82%
My love isn't enough?

359
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.160 line:82%
Don't I take care of you?

360
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.370 line:82%
Will your wife clean your
vomit every Friday and Saturday?

361
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.540 line:82%
As if you do.

362
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.700 line:82%
At least I encourage you.

363
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.870 line:82%
Who holds your forehead?

364
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.240 line:82%
Didn't I take care of
you when you had fever in May?

365
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.580 line:82%
I had to go on my third date.

366
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.080 line:82%
I was going to get lucky, but
I canceled and stayed back with you.

367
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.080 line:82%
"I don't take care of you!"

368
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.950 line:82%
What is it that your wife
will give you that I cannot?

369
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.120 line:82%
Except for one thing.

370
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.790 line:82%
And I can arrange for that as well.

371
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.620 line:82%
Just tell me.

372
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.620 line:82%
But I am not getting married for sex.

373
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.990 line:82%
Ghasitey, talk to him. He has lost it.

374
00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.450 line:82%
We are still so young.

375
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.290 line:82%
Who gets married
at a tender age of 27?

376
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.160 line:82%
Ghasitey, support?

377
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.490 line:82%
Forget it. How does it concern us?

378
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.160 line:82%
He will be the one getting laid.

379
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.700 line:82%
He will be the one buying a condom.

380
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.200 line:82%
We just have to go there to get drunk.

381
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.330 line:82%
I am not getting married for sex.

382
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.870 line:82%
Then why are you getting married?

383
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.040 line:82%
Because he is nuts.

384
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.450 line:82%
Who's behind this shit?

385
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.740 line:82%
Who found the girl?

386
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.950 line:82%
They approached us.

387
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.450 line:82%
How is that possible?

388
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.950 line:82%
What do you mean?

389
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.450 line:82%
No one approached for me.

390
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.660 line:82%
As you are not my heir.

391
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.160 line:82%
For someone to approach...

392
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.660 line:82%
That hurt, Ghasitey!

393
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.200 line:82%
I'll leave something
for you too in my will.

394
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.540 line:82%
You still haven't made your will?

395
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.370 line:82%
Listen...

396
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.830 line:82%
No nonsense, no arguments, no fights.

397
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.370 line:82%
I swear I'll use my sandals
if anyone behaves badly.

398
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.580 line:82%
Except for you two,
mother will use her sandals for y'all.

399
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.870 line:82%
Titu...

400
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.580 line:82%
Ready?

401
00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:55.910 line:82%
- Let's go already.
- Let's go.

402
00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.450 line:82%
Hello.

403
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.290 line:82%
Hi.

404
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.620 line:82%
Hello.

405
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.290 line:82%
Hi.

406
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.700 line:82%
Have you tried our milk cake?

407
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.540 line:82%
Only from your Delhi Branch.

408
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.700 line:82%
I swear, I haven't tried
such milk cake anywhere in Alwar.

409
00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.870 line:82%
Come to Meerut and try our Pedas.

410
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.120 line:82%
Confectioners of Mathura
send spies to find out the recipe.

411
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.620 line:82%
- Really?
- Yes.

412
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.740 line:82%
Sonu, are you a business partner?

413
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.160 line:82%
Forget the business,
these two are partners in everything.

414
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.120 line:82%
He owns an event company.

415
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:13.990 line:82%
Okay.

416
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.660 line:82%
We will handle the formalities.

417
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.660 line:82%
You go and talk to each other.

418
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.490 line:82%
I was just going to say that.

419
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.370 line:82%
Where are you going?

420
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.700 line:82%
If he could have his way, he would
accompany them on their honeymoon.

421
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.740 line:82%
Mummy, they aren't going to
get romantic on their first meeting.

422
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.410 line:82%
And what will I do over here?

423
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.740 line:82%
Let them spend some time alone.

424
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.580 line:82%
You can join them later.

425
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.330 line:82%
I hope your family is not
pressurizing you to get married.

426
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:50.990 line:82%
Why?

427
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.990 line:82%
Then I'd say that I am not interested.

428
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.370 line:82%
No, I asked them myself to arrange it.

429
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:56.370 line:82%
Why?

430
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.870 line:82%
You couldn't find someone on your own?

431
00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.040 line:82%
I had a breakup six months ago.

432
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:01.700 line:82%
We were together for two years.

433
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:03.870 line:82%
Then?

434
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.240 line:82%
Sonu was convinced
that she is wrong for me.

435
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.240 line:82%
So he broke us off.

436
00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.410 line:82%
Sonu must be dying to
know what we are talking about.

437
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:14.950 line:82%
Who is elder, Sonu or you?

438
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.580 line:82%
I am, around three months.

439
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.990 line:82%
He was born in September
and I was born in June.

440
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.620 line:82%
I thought you were real brothers.

441
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.790 line:82%
Best friends.

442
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.490 line:82%
Since kindergarten.

443
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.160 line:82%
Oh, he addressed aunty as mummy,
so I thought...

444
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.490 line:82%
We were in school when
his mother passed away.

445
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.830 line:82%
Our mothers were close friends.

446
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.200 line:82%
Ever since then...

447
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.870 line:82%
Uncle is alive hence,
he doesn't address papa as 'papa.'

448
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.240 line:82%
I mean my papa.

449
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.740 line:82%
We grew up in the same house.

450
00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.540 line:82%
He used to visit
uncle once a week or so.

451
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.240 line:82%
Then uncle shifted to Canada
so the visits ended as well.

452
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.450 line:82%
We stay together in Delhi as well.

453
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.240 line:82%
Sonu didn't shift to Canada?

454
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.290 line:82%
Leaving me alone?

455
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.450 line:82%
Forget thinking,
no one even bothered asking about it.

456
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.160 line:82%
I'll go see where they are.

457
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.490 line:82%
Relax, she won't kidnap your Titu.

458
00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.160 line:82%
Stay here.

459
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.870 line:82%
When grandpa opened the shop uncle
Lalu used to work there as a cleaner.

460
00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.740 line:82%
Then grandma started
treating him as her brother.

461
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.740 line:82%
Ghasita and Lalu uncle
are like Batman and Robin.

462
00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:14.910 line:82%
He stays with you?

463
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:15.580 line:82%
Yes.

464
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.620 line:82%
Grandpa and he drink every
night at his bedroom's balcony.

465
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.240 line:82%
He owns 7% of the company.

466
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.950 line:82%
Technically the company belongs
to grandpa and uncle Lalu.

467
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.620 line:82%
But it's grandma who rules the house.

468
00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.330 line:82%
Because grandma controls the cash.

469
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.120 line:82%
All the cash is stored
in her cupboard.

470
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.830 line:82%
And she gives the
keys only to uncle Lalu.

471
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.200 line:82%
You can say that even my
mother has never touched those keys.

472
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.370 line:82%
Do you tell all girls where you keep
the cash in the first meeting itself?

473
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.240 line:82%
You like kids a lot?

474
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.410 line:82%
Hmm.

475
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.950 line:82%
I never had the motivation
to make a lot of money.

476
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.290 line:82%
I just intended on
being happy in what I do.

477
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.990 line:82%
You can open your NGO after marriage.

478
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.990 line:82%
Why?

479
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.330 line:82%
Do you mind if I have
a job after marriage?

480
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.040 line:82%
And what do you mean
by after marriage?

481
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.160 line:82%
Aren't you going too fast ?

482
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.200 line:82%
That's why Sonu is always so worried.

483
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.240 line:82%
Are you going to say no?

484
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.700 line:82%
Go with them.

485
00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.950 line:82%
- Lalu?
- Yes, sister?

486
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.290 line:82%
Send someone to Delhi.

487
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.830 line:82%
Start getting information
from all the shops near their house.

488
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.160 line:82%
I have already found out.

489
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.160 line:82%
No one smokes,
neither openly nor stealthily...

490
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.330 line:82%
Hiding from the wife.

491
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.200 line:82%
Isn't NGO a place where they
first rescue dogs and then sell them?

492
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.700 line:82%
Not all NGOs deal with dogs.

493
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.200 line:82%
She works for a children's NGO.

494
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.410 line:82%
Mrs. Renu had told us.

495
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.080 line:82%
We only heard NGO.

496
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.910 line:82%
Did you have a private
word with Mrs. Renu?

497
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.580 line:82%
Isn't she too slim?

498
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.910 line:82%
It gets problematic
while delivering a child.

499
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:30.950 line:82%
We are confectioners.

500
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.120 line:82%
We will make her fat
before we make her pregnant.

501
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.580 line:82%
'We will make her' means?

502
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.290 line:82%
Do you think before you speak?

503
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.950 line:82%
'We are confectioners' means?

504
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.660 line:82%
Do you think before you speak?

505
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.330 line:82%
Mummy?

506
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.660 line:82%
Don't you think she is too short?

507
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.660 line:82%
Do you want to play
basketball with her?

508
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.540 line:82%
Did anyone see what car they drive?

509
00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.490 line:82%
I think Volkswagen.

510
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.540 line:82%
What kind of guesswork is that?

511
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.660 line:82%
It's not guesswork.

512
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.830 line:82%
I am from a jeweler family.

513
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.700 line:82%
We can extract the biodata about a family
just by looking at the necklace.

514
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.660 line:82%
Car is such a small thing.

515
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.540 line:82%
They own a Skoda.

516
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.700 line:82%
I asked the valet.

517
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:56.370 line:82%
When?

518
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.910 line:82%
When you were busy greeting them.

519
00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.740 line:82%
Do you have anything to say now?

520
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.580 line:82%
Skoda and Volkswagen
are one and the same company.

521
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.740 line:82%
They also own a Volkswagen.

522
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:02.910 line:82%
That's Polo.

523
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.290 line:82%
Volkswagen nevertheless.

524
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.450 line:82%
How many friends does she have?

525
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.620 line:82%
How would he know?

526
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.790 line:82%
I mean Facebook friends.

527
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.790 line:82%
It's on the internet.

528
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.620 line:82%
How do you know?

529
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:10.830 line:82%
He has a Facebook account.

530
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:12.990 line:82%
900 friends?

531
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.120 line:82%
Don't you think that's a lot?

532
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:14.620 line:82%
Why?

533
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.830 line:82%
I have 540 friends.

534
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.160 line:82%
How many of them are boys?

535
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.660 line:82%
Come on, mummy.

536
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.160 line:82%
I am asking about Sweety's friends.

537
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.540 line:82%
Come on, grandma.

538
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.540 line:82%
She votes.

539
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.540 line:82%
But how will we find out who for?

540
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.200 line:82%
- Yes.
- That's confidential.

541
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.410 line:82%
Oh my, it's confidential
when it comes to her?

542
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.240 line:82%
We always discuss before we vote.

543
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.240 line:82%
Titu will feel bad but she
doesn't have any style sense...

544
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240 line:82%
...in spite of staying in Delhi.

545
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.410 line:82%
She is looking good.

546
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.120 line:82%
I am talking about the
mother and not the daughter, son.

547
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.450 line:82%
Not even engaged yet and
he's already fighting with his mother.

548
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.620 line:82%
Who is fighting? I am just saying.

549
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.790 line:82%
First, say the thing
which is of utmost importance.

550
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.160 line:82%
We have already said it.

551
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.160 line:82%
What do I say?

552
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.160 line:82%
What's there to say?

553
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.160 line:82%
If nothing is wrong then it is right.

554
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.660 line:82%
Yes, we didn't find anything wrong.

555
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.660 line:82%
You say.

556
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:54.870 line:82%
What do you think?

557
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.540 line:82%
She's the first girl he has met.

558
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.370 line:82%
So?

559
00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.870 line:82%
Where does it say that
the first girl can't be good?

560
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.870 line:82%
Are we shopping for clothes here...

561
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.540 line:82%
...that we should go to
a few shops before buying one?

562
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.410 line:82%
Mummy, I mean,
what should I compare it with?

563
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.700 line:82%
Whom do you want to compare her with?

564
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.580 line:82%
We aren't buying a car.

565
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.910 line:82%
Tell us whether you
like the girl or not.

566
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.950 line:82%
What's there to compare?

567
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.290 line:82%
I'll think over it and let you know.

568
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.740 line:82%
Yes, think over it,
discuss it and let us know.

569
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:17.290 line:82%
We like her.

570
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:17.990 line:82%
Let's go.

571
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.370 line:82%
Rebound is having sex
after a week in anger,

572
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.080 line:82%
Not marrying after 6 months in sorrow.

573
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.290 line:82%
I am not sad, bro.

574
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.580 line:82%
Then how did you get this idea?

575
00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.410 line:82%
You are the one who
always talks about settling.

576
00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.120 line:82%
By settling, I mean, expanding
the business, making more money.

577
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.120 line:82%
So, this will take care
of one department, right?

578
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.950 line:82%
Marriage will cover 20
percent of the "settling" part.

579
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.290 line:82%
Then we will make more money.

580
00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.160 line:82%
First, you stop smiling.

581
00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.870 line:82%
I swear, I will break your teeth.

582
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.450 line:82%
Why aren't you giving
an answer to mummy?

583
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.240 line:82%
Are you?

584
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.950 line:82%
When I seriously do not understand
why you are getting married...

585
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.120 line:82%
...then how do I decide about the girl?

586
00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.450 line:82%
Look, I know you are doubtful.

587
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.620 line:82%
But I seriously think
that I should get married.

588
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.660 line:82%
Otherwise,
I'll again fall for some girl.

589
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.290 line:82%
She will make me cry
and you will make me stop.

590
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.490 line:82%
She will make me cry
and you will make me stop.

591
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.830 line:82%
She will make me cry
and you will make me stop.

592
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.330 line:82%
That irritates you as well.

593
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.490 line:82%
I don't have any problem with that.

594
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.370 line:82%
I will handle it.

595
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.370 line:82%
I promise.

596
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.540 line:82%
You can cry as much as you want.

597
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.540 line:82%
What do you think about Sweety?

598
00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.740 line:82%
Who can tell whether a girl is the right
girl to marry in only one meeting?

599
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.580 line:82%
I mean there should
be some compatibility...

600
00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.240 line:82%
...a chance to know each other better,
matching wavelengths.

601
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.120 line:82%
I hope you are getting me.

602
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:49.790 line:82%
Of course.

603
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.620 line:82%
How can you get married
after just one meeting...

604
00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.790 line:82%
...because you didn't
find anything wrong?

605
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.120 line:82%
Correct, you cannot.

606
00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.950 line:82%
And you are all smiles these days.

607
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.660 line:82%
You were better off crying.

608
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.330 line:82%
But one can at least
get betrothed, right?

609
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.160 line:82%
People get betrothed so that
they can know each other better...

610
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.870 line:82%
...understand their compatibility,
wavelength and everything else.

611
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.040 line:82%
Is she good enough
to get betrothed to?

612
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.540 line:82%
She is okay.

613
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.740 line:82%
Yes, mom?

614
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.910 line:82%
She is good.

615
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.740 line:82%
Say yes.

616
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:20.700 line:82%
Yes.

617
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.410 line:82%
Yes, okay.

618
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.120 line:82%
Okay, bye.

619
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.830 line:82%
"Restlessness I feel from
the first moment itself..."

620
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.240 line:82%
"What the future beholds
I can't foretell."

621
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:56.410 line:82%
"Why my heart is inclining
towards you, I can't tell."

622
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.790 line:82%
"New beginnings..."

623
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:03.790 line:82%
"These are new things..."

624
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.660 line:82%
"The darkness has faded away..."

625
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.330 line:82%
"It seems."

626
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:17.870 line:82%
"A new dawn, when I met you..."

627
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.080 line:82%
"When I met you..."

628
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.910 line:82%
"I found new air to breathe."

629
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:33.080 line:82%
"A new dawn, when I met you..."

630
00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.120 line:82%
"When I met you..."

631
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.830 line:82%
"I found new air to breathe."

632
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.790 line:82%
"When I met you..."

633
00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.870 line:82%
"A new dawn..."

634
00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:11.290 line:82%
"Now my heartbeats
travel as per your wish."

635
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.160 line:82%
"When you looked at me,
I felt alive..."

636
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.700 line:82%
"Magical are your eyes."

637
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.160 line:82%
"You are..."

638
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.200 line:82%
"My world..."

639
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.040 line:82%
"You are...
the one my heart belongs to..."

640
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.700 line:82%
"You are
the one my world revolves around..."

641
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:34.540 line:82%
"You are
the one my heart belongs to..."

642
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.950 line:82%
"You are the one who
makes me aware of myself."

643
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:46.160 line:82%
"A new dawn, when I met you..."

644
00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.290 line:82%
"When I met you..."

645
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:53.990 line:82%
"I found new air to breathe."

646
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.490 line:82%
"When I met you..."

647
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.200 line:82%
"A new dawn..."

648
00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.450 line:82%
"When I met you..."

649
00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.080 line:82%
Can't you hear the violins?

650
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.370 line:82%
Why would I hear violins?

651
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.950 line:82%
They are playing so loud for me.

652
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.620 line:82%
Listen carefully and
you too will hear it.

653
00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.660 line:82%
You have confused me.

654
00:30:59.040 --> 00:30:59.660 line:82%
Why?

655
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.700 line:82%
I don't understand whether ours is an
arranged marriage or love marriage.

656
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.370 line:82%
Let's go, sister.

657
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.450 line:82%
Rebound is having sex after
a week in anger, you idiot.

658
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.870 line:82%
Not marrying after
six months if you are sad

659
00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.200 line:82%
What's this?

660
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.330 line:82%
It's from home.

661
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.830 line:82%
From Meerut?

662
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.370 line:82%
Shall I send it back?

663
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.370 line:82%
Set the table.

664
00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.910 line:82%
She is so cute.

665
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.790 line:82%
Too cute to be true.

666
00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:58.450 line:82%
What happened?

667
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.790 line:82%
Spill it out.

668
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.660 line:82%
You are so happy these days,
Titu that its...

669
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.490 line:82%
I don't know how to say it.

670
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.200 line:82%
You don't like Sweety?

671
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.040 line:82%
She is a case of 'too good to be true.'

672
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.370 line:82%
When you see a very good deal
you get this thought in your mind...

673
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.370 line:82%
...that something is
surely wrong about it.

674
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.410 line:82%
I mean the last time I
saw such a family was in '96...

675
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.740 line:82%
In the movie Hum Apke Hain Kaun.

676
00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.740 line:82%
That's '94.

677
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:24.120 line:82%
It was in the theaters for two years.

678
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.790 line:82%
I saw it again in '96.

679
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:27.790 line:82%
Stick to the point.

680
00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.950 line:82%
Look, I am still not
getting the right feeling.

681
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:32.620 line:82%
A feeling is a feeling...

682
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.990 line:82%
There is no reason
or proof to back it.

683
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.450 line:82%
Instead, I have only proof against it.

684
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.330 line:82%
She works at a children's NGO.

685
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.990 line:82%
She is polite to everyone.

686
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.370 line:82%
She sends tiffins.

687
00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.490 line:82%
She does all the correct things.

688
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.330 line:82%
But that's the issue.

689
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.990 line:82%
She does all the correct things.

690
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.540 line:82%
No one can be so perfect.

691
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.540 line:82%
Something has to be fishy.

692
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.240 line:82%
This is your motherly instinct for me.

693
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.200 line:82%
Look, you have always got
me out of shit girls have put me in.

694
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.580 line:82%
You are being protective of me.

695
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.290 line:82%
I am not saying it is wrong
for you to get these feelings.

696
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.620 line:82%
But this time the feeling
that you are getting is wrong.

697
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.290 line:82%
I think you should spend
more time with Sweety.

698
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.790 line:82%
I am telling you...

699
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.330 line:82%
Once you get to know her,
you'll feel differently.

700
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.490 line:82%
I guarantee that.

701
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:10.330 line:82%
It's just a bad feeling.

702
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.330 line:82%
Are you seriously sure about this?

703
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.330 line:82%
Because I am not at all convinced.

704
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:15.700 line:82%
I am sure.

705
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:16.830 line:82%
100 percent.

706
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.200 line:82%
She is different.

707
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.700 line:82%
You know every idiot in this
world thinks his girl is different.

708
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:28.040 line:82%
And after hearing you say
that I am sure that you are so F.

709
00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:49.700 line:82%
Titu told me that you couldn't believe
that he found such a nice girl.

710
00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:55.200 line:82%
Yes, I told her that you couldn't
believe that she's actually so nice.

711
00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.370 line:82%
Just consider him lucky.

712
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.740 line:82%
Like he found such
a good friend like you...

713
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.410 line:82%
...he also found such
a good girl for himself.

714
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.790 line:82%
Do I look like a liar?

715
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:26.830 line:82%
Whom will the husband
tell if not his wife?

716
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.410 line:82%
Is this something you share?

717
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.740 line:82%
It's not the conversation
but the people who matter.

718
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.910 line:82%
Like I tell everything to Lalu.

719
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080 line:82%
Like you tell everything to Titu.

720
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.410 line:82%
And Titu tells Sweety.

721
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.910 line:82%
Everything is going wrong, Ghasita.

722
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.450 line:82%
My feelings are getting stronger.

723
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.790 line:82%
I don't know what to do now.

724
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.120 line:82%
He is getting out of my control.

725
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:46.120 line:82%
What you thought was a strong
thread was just a weak string.

726
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:46.990 line:82%
It broke.

727
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.990 line:82%
And the kite is floating
in the sky, Sonu.

728
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.950 line:82%
Don't feel disheartened.

729
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:51.660 line:82%
It will fall on Sweety's roof.

730
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.200 line:82%
He will run and grab it.

731
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.200 line:82%
Sonu is no less.

732
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.370 line:82%
Wanna bet?

733
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.540 line:82%
Sonu...

734
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040 line:82%
Should I bet on you?

735
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:00.870 line:82%
Go ahead... pull my leg.

736
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.240 line:82%
I am warning you,
if they get married...

737
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.410 line:82%
"I think you should spend
more time with Sweety."

738
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.410 line:82%
"I am telling you..."

739
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.240 line:82%
"Once you get to know her,
you'll feel differently."

740
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.290 line:82%
"I guarantee it."

741
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.450 line:82%
"It's just a bad feeling."

742
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:52.160 line:82%
Who are you?

743
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.660 line:82%
- Babu?
- Sister?

744
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.160 line:82%
Sonu...

745
00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:57.660 line:82%
Okay, sister.

746
00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:59.330 line:82%
Make some lemonade for him.

747
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:00.490 line:82%
Okay.

748
00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.370 line:82%
You met Babu?

749
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:06.200 line:82%
Why is he here?

750
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.080 line:82%
He's here for us.

751
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.040 line:82%
I don't need him.

752
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.240 line:82%
Even public toilets
are cleaner than these.

753
00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.910 line:82%
We have a maid who cleans them.

754
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.410 line:82%
Why did you call Babu for it?

755
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.410 line:82%
What will he do the rest of the time?

756
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.740 line:82%
What do you mean by what will he do?

757
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:16.620 line:82%
Babu...

758
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.620 line:82%
Call the plumber in the afternoon
and get the flush repaired.

759
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.620 line:82%
Send the bedsheets to the laundry.

760
00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.450 line:82%
And make watermelon juice for Titu.

761
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.450 line:82%
What's the use of
making so much money...

762
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.120 line:82%
...when you are still
living like in a hostel?

763
00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.160 line:82%
There has to be a quality
of life as well, right?

764
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.200 line:82%
What's your full name?

765
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.240 line:82%
Babu... Jaidev Babu.

766
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.370 line:82%
Your egg white omelette.

767
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.240 line:82%
Who asked you to
make the omelet?

768
00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:48.410 line:82%
Sister.

769
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.740 line:82%
Who asked you to make
it using only egg whites?

770
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.290 line:82%
Sister.

771
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.290 line:82%
He is her squealer.

772
00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:59.160 line:82%
Squealer?

773
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.120 line:82%
A spy, you dunce!

774
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:00.830 line:82%
James Bond.

775
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.490 line:82%
She is M and he is her 007.

776
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:03.330 line:82%
I am telling you.

777
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.330 line:82%
Whom am I even telling!

778
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.740 line:82%
Babu, where are my jeans?

779
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.580 line:82%
They're still wet.

780
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.080 line:82%
Why?

781
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.080 line:82%
I washed it.

782
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.580 line:82%
Who asked you to wash it?

783
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.950 line:82%
Sister.

784
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.660 line:82%
What is this?

785
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.200 line:82%
Bread made from pearl millet flour.

786
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.870 line:82%
Sister asked me to make it.

787
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:56.580 line:82%
Sister asked me to do it.

788
00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.290 line:82%
Babu, where are my shoes?

789
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:07.290 line:82%
Sister asked me to do it.

790
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.950 line:82%
But idiot, where are they?

791
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.950 line:82%
Outside, on the rack.

792
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:14.160 line:82%
Yes.

793
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.910 line:82%
Babu... what are you doing, Babu?

794
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.950 line:82%
Forgive me, please?

795
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:31.950 line:82%
Babu... what are you doing, Babu?

796
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.120 line:82%
Babu... no!

797
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:35.620 line:82%
Sister asked me to do it!

798
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:50.540 line:82%
Hey you...

799
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:51.700 line:82%
Yes?

800
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:52.870 line:82%
Whose t-shirt is that?

801
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.040 line:82%
Mine.

802
00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.870 line:82%
Really?

803
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:55.910 line:82%
Where did you buy it from?

804
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:56.580 line:82%
Sister...

805
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.540 line:82%
You bought it from sister?

806
00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.200 line:82%
Sister sells t-shirts?

807
00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.080 line:82%
You liar...

808
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:00.740 line:82%
Sister!

809
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:01.740 line:82%
What happened, Babu?

810
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.240 line:82%
Brother wants my t-shirt.

811
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:06.620 line:82%
I am so sorry, Sonu.

812
00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.120 line:82%
I found it with Titu's
old clothes so I thought...

813
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:10.790 line:82%
Return it, Babu.

814
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.160 line:82%
Have you gone crazy?

815
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.490 line:82%
You can buy a new one, Sonu.

816
00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:16.620 line:82%
I wasn't asking for it, I was just...

817
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.830 line:82%
I am really sorry, Sonu...

818
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:18.870 line:82%
I didn't think...

819
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.990 line:82%
Babu, give it back.

820
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.370 line:82%
I wasn't asking for it,
Sweety, I was just asking...

821
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.040 line:82%
Babu, I just asked you, didn't I?

822
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.080 line:82%
You are just too much.

823
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.580 line:82%
You made the poor boy cry.

824
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:20.950 line:82%
Babu...

825
00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.490 line:82%
Yes, brother.

826
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.870 line:82%
Can I have the remote?

827
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.370 line:82%
Thank you.

828
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:41.580 line:82%
Babu...

829
00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.120 line:82%
Can I have the other one as well?

830
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.740 line:82%
Can I have some water, please?

831
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:55.240 line:82%
Babu...

832
00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:55.790 line:82%
Hmm?

833
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.740 line:82%
- Babu...
- Yes?

834
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.330 line:82%
Babu... wake up!

835
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:57.950 line:82%
Yes?

836
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:59.830 line:82%
Can I have some salad, please?

837
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:21.910 line:82%
Babu!

838
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:22.910 line:82%
Yes, brother!

839
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.290 line:82%
Can you help me wash it, please?

840
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.160 line:82%
Babu!

841
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:52.410 line:82%
You work so hard, Babu.

842
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.080 line:82%
You'll die if you
keep working like this.

843
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.240 line:82%
You are so young.

844
00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.450 line:82%
There is something called
quality of life as well, right?

845
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.240 line:82%
Leave that and come with me.

846
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.160 line:82%
Learn to relax a little.

847
00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.330 line:82%
Look what I brought for you.

848
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:15.370 line:82%
Don't worry.

849
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.160 line:82%
Sister won't find out.

850
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:23.870 line:82%
You relax over here.

851
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.410 line:82%
I'll be back.

852
00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.870 line:82%
Babu, porn? That too Bhojpuri?

853
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:53.370 line:82%
Disgusting.

854
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:57.200 line:82%
Sister, it is not what it looks like.

855
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.740 line:82%
I am being trapped.

856
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:11.120 line:82%
I am innocent.

857
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:50.490 line:82%
"Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la,
ooh la la You are my fantasy..."

858
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.410 line:82%
Hi.

859
00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:03.410 line:82%
Hi.

860
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.290 line:82%
At least tell me that you
have given her the house keys.

861
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:15.290 line:82%
What if I was naked?

862
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.160 line:82%
That wouldn't have tipped
you when she is going to show up.

863
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:18.990 line:82%
You should be doing it in the bedroom.

864
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.490 line:82%
Is there a sofa here?

865
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:21.620 line:82%
You have a bed!

866
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:22.620 line:82%
I like sofas.

867
00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:23.660 line:82%
I want to do it on the sofa.

868
00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.490 line:82%
It's my wish I'll
do it wherever I want to.

869
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.160 line:82%
Then get the sofa in your bedroom.

870
00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.660 line:82%
22nd December, 27th December...

871
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:54.160 line:82%
After that there's 24th February.

872
00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.830 line:82%
No no, why wait till February?

873
00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.490 line:82%
22nd October is fine.

874
00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:00.490 line:82%
Not October, he said December.

875
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:02.200 line:82%
You said December?

876
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:05.870 line:82%
I said October.

877
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:07.700 line:82%
- October.
- October.

878
00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.910 line:82%
It falls on a Saturday.

879
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.540 line:82%
It will be easy for
everyone to attend as well.

880
00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.740 line:82%
It's perfect.

881
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.120 line:82%
So 22nd October is fixed.

882
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:16.740 line:82%
Good.

883
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:17.790 line:82%
Offer sweets to everyone.

884
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.450 line:82%
Whatever date it is,
I just want everything to go smoothly.

885
00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.950 line:82%
Here, the date is fixed.

886
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.790 line:82%
Have as much fun as
you want with your friend.

887
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.950 line:82%
- You don't have much time with him now.
- Congratulations.

888
00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.330 line:82%
Then say it.

889
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.160 line:82%
Why are you feeling shy?

890
00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:31.160 line:82%
What is it?

891
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:31.990 line:82%
It's nothing, grandma.

892
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.700 line:82%
She had thought of
something but now...

893
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.040 line:82%
Just say it Sweety.

894
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.160 line:82%
Grandma, I had said that
I'd hold a prayer function at home...

895
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.200 line:82%
...when my wedding date gets fixed.

896
00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:43.410 line:82%
Then do that, dear.

897
00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.410 line:82%
We will definitely attend it.

898
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.040 line:82%
Mummy, at 'home.'

899
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:51.620 line:82%
Sonu...

900
00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:52.740 line:82%
Titu...

901
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:54.080 line:82%
Make preparations for it.

902
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.700 line:82%
What is it?

903
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:17.910 line:82%
What's wrong?

904
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.410 line:82%
Ghasitey,
I am telling you, this girl is wrong.

905
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:24.910 line:82%
Have you ever met such a sweet girl,
such a nice family?

906
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:25.950 line:82%
It's a sham.

907
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:27.580 line:82%
Well I'm convinced it's a sham.

908
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.290 line:82%
How can anyone trust anything about
a person who praises our milk cake?

909
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:36.660 line:82%
The way he did it. That
too of the Delhi Branch.

910
00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:37.790 line:82%
Right, Lalu?

911
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:39.830 line:82%
Looked like cheats to me.

912
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:40.870 line:82%
True.

913
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.870 line:82%
Then why aren't you saying anything?

914
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:44.870 line:82%
Why should I?

915
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.370 line:82%
Who cares!

916
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.740 line:82%
Everyone in this house
thinks that they are over-smart.

917
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:50.870 line:82%
Good for them.

918
00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.240 line:82%
They will learn a hard lesson.

919
00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.740 line:82%
He is your grandson.

920
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.580 line:82%
That doesn't make me
responsible for his life.

921
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:56.620 line:82%
I taught him how to earn.

922
00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.910 line:82%
Opened a shop for him.

923
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:59.120 line:82%
I have done my duty.

924
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.790 line:82%
It won't make any difference to you
if a wrong girl comes to your house?

925
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:03.120 line:82%
How would it make
any difference to me?

926
00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:05.830 line:82%
It is my house, my money, my company.

927
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.490 line:82%
And I haven't made a will
either that she'd kill me.

928
00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:11.290 line:82%
And I won't let him eat anything she
cooks before tasting it first, so...

929
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:12.830 line:82%
What are you saying?

930
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.700 line:82%
Look, we know that
she is a wrong girl.

931
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:16.700 line:82%
Even if she were right...

932
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.200 line:82%
...it wouldn't have
made any difference to us.

933
00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.540 line:82%
Now at least there is some scope
of entertainment in the house.

934
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.580 line:82%
Now the fun will begin
when she has to pick sides.

935
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.240 line:82%
Titu's grandma vs Titu's mom.

936
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.240 line:82%
There were just two of them so far...

937
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:28.080 line:82%
...so it was smooth sailing.

938
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:30.910 line:82%
Now with three, groupism will start.

939
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:32.120 line:82%
We know everything.

940
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:33.620 line:82%
Don't bore us.

941
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:35.290 line:82%
Don't ruin our night.

942
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.830 line:82%
Have a drink if you want
to otherwise go to sleep.

943
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:43.450 line:82%
Hey, you...

944
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.950 line:82%
Close the door.

945
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.410 line:82%
Rukmani, if even after
52 years you don't trust me...

946
00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.040 line:82%
...then I swear, all these
years have just been an utter waste.

947
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.910 line:82%
I am telling you, I don't have it.

948
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.240 line:82%
I was just praying.

949
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.120 line:82%
Untie your pajama.

950
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:07.240 line:82%
Show me the pockets
of your underpants.

951
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.080 line:82%
I don't have it.

952
00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.450 line:82%
From the time you have
made me take an oath...

953
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:10.620 line:82%
I haven't even seen them.

954
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:14.330 line:82%
He hasn't even touched them for
nine years after he pledged to you.

955
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.330 line:82%
You consider him to be your brother.

956
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:17.950 line:82%
Believe in your brother.

957
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.540 line:82%
Lalu...

958
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:20.330 line:82%
Sister?

959
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.160 line:82%
Swear on our bond,
and say that he doesn't smoke.

960
00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.410 line:82%
I swear on our bond, my sister...

961
00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.740 line:82%
He doesn't smoke.

962
00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.450 line:82%
The guest list has exceeded 2000.

963
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.290 line:82%
Have you found a farmhouse?

964
00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:41.290 line:82%
What's the hurry?

965
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:42.790 line:82%
It's not like the wedding is tomorrow.

966
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:44.620 line:82%
Right, so we'll look for a
farmhouse one day before the wedding?

967
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.490 line:82%
Then you can talk to the decorator
on the day of the wedding itself.

968
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:48.330 line:82%
But we have such a
nice farmhouse ourselves.

969
00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:49.950 line:82%
But it cannot accommodate 2000 guests.

970
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.660 line:82%
Why are we spending so much money?

971
00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.330 line:82%
Let's invite relatives who will
actually be pleased with our marriage.

972
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:56.490 line:82%
2000 people will attend the wedding.

973
00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:57.990 line:82%
Out of them 900 wouldn't even know us,

974
00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.370 line:82%
And we wouldn't know 900,

975
00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:00.870 line:82%
We'll only be wasting money.

976
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.370 line:82%
We will have to invite those
whose weddings we have attended.

977
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:04.700 line:82%
Otherwise everyone will taunt...

978
00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:05.910 line:82%
...that we took the
cheap way out on our turn.

979
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.370 line:82%
And why are you getting
worried about the money?

980
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.790 line:82%
I had a word with your father
that we'll spilt the expenses.

981
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.120 line:82%
It's not about the expenses.

982
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:13.790 line:82%
Who else do they have but me?

983
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.450 line:82%
And who else do y'all have but Titu?

984
00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.120 line:82%
So whoever spends it,
it's our money that's getting wasted.

985
00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:21.990 line:82%
Sweety and I have
been discussing this...

986
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.490 line:82%
...why don't we go for a destination
wedding with a few close relatives?

987
00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.160 line:82%
Now that's a money saver!

988
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.870 line:82%
You want to do a destination
wedding to save money?

989
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.200 line:82%
You will end up spending
double the amount.

990
00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.540 line:82%
I am telling you,
he will make you go bankrupt.

991
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.910 line:82%
Destination weddings
cost half as much in reality.

992
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.910 line:82%
Shall I recommend
a good event manager?

993
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:38.740 line:82%
You can get it checked.

994
00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.790 line:82%
Your grandpa has made a lot of
money and worked very hard to make it.

995
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:51.290 line:82%
Titu's my only grandson.

996
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.120 line:82%
This isn't going
to be any small wedding.

997
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.330 line:82%
You just think about
what more we can do!

998
00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:56.990 line:82%
Do you want to drive off
from the wedding in a Jaguar?

999
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:59.660 line:82%
Sonu, check the delivery period.

1000
00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.040 line:82%
Better idea, just give me the money.

1001
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.990 line:82%
I will make a fixed deposit.

1002
00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.370 line:82%
Hahaha...

1003
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:07.910 line:82%
Such girls bring prosperity to
the house.

1004
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.450 line:82%
Lalu...

1005
00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.330 line:82%
Take another percent.

1006
00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:30.330 line:82%
It would be better if you take the
other 7 percent back as well, Ghasitey.

1007
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:32.660 line:82%
I am going to tell
the truth to sister today.

1008
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.540 line:82%
What's the big deal today?

1009
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.200 line:82%
We have been settling every lie with
one percent since the last 52 years.

1010
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.370 line:82%
Take two this time.

1011
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.370 line:82%
You'll become a 9 percent
owner of my wealth.

1012
00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.040 line:82%
Two percent?

1013
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.580 line:82%
Mr. Ghasitaram...

1014
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.790 line:82%
This wasn't a small lie.

1015
00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.620 line:82%
You don't have a sister!

1016
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:58.160 line:82%
You don't know the
difference between lying...

1017
00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:01.990 line:82%
...and lying by swearing on
the bond, Mr. Ghasita.

1018
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:10.200 line:82%
Does that chair belong to your father?

1019
00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.870 line:82%
Is it your father's?

1020
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.240 line:82%
That chair belongs to Lalu!

1021
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.240 line:82%
Can you explain the difference?

1022
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:23.580 line:82%
There is a difference of six percent!

1023
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.620 line:82%
Four... four percent.

1024
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:30.950 line:82%
Seven and four,
settle on eleven percent.

1025
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:33.830 line:82%
It's an auspicious number too

1026
00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:39.490 line:82%
That's better.

1027
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.370 line:82%
Hey you...

1028
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:43.040 line:82%
Move!

1029
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.700 line:82%
Come, sit.

1030
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:50.740 line:82%
Here.

1031
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.410 line:82%
It's all going wrong.

1032
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:03.580 line:82%
Here...

1033
00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:05.450 line:82%
Go give it to Titu's father.

1034
00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:07.490 line:82%
- Reena...
- Yes?

1035
00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.620 line:82%
That's not how it's done.

1036
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:29.120 line:82%
What is this?

1037
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:31.950 line:82%
Bill... of the wedding agency.

1038
00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:33.450 line:82%
150,000?

1039
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:35.620 line:82%
Yes, we took the platinum package.

1040
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:36.790 line:82%
They are good.

1041
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:37.790 line:82%
They match everything.

1042
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:40.490 line:82%
They find out about all expectations,
budgets and then fix a meeting.

1043
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.120 line:82%
So Titu's wedding is through them?

1044
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.330 line:82%
Through them? Yes.

1045
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:46.660 line:82%
We took their package for Titu...

1046
00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.040 line:82%
And Sweety's family too
must have taken a package.

1047
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.370 line:82%
They must have seen
the biodata and called.

1048
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:51.990 line:82%
What are you doing?

1049
00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:53.540 line:82%
A joke.

1050
00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.240 line:82%
I will frame it and
gift it to Titu and Sweety.

1051
00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.370 line:82%
Strange.

1052
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.080 line:82%
A joke?

1053
00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:01.910 line:82%
Hello?

1054
00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:03.450 line:82%
Is this Vivah's office?

1055
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:06.080 line:82%
I am calling from Ghasitaram's place.

1056
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:08.240 line:82%
Can we meet today?

1057
00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.240 line:82%
Yes, sure.

1058
00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:58.370 line:82%
Take this, we are getting late.

1059
00:54:58.540 --> 00:54:59.160 line:82%
Take this as well.

1060
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.370 line:82%
Grandma, Titu is asking for fifty.

1061
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:02.540 line:82%
Lalu...

1062
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:05.910 line:82%
Get fifty.

1063
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:09.080 line:82%
"What are you doing?"

1064
00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:12.120 line:82%
"Why have you forgotten Goddess?"

1065
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:13.740 line:82%
Grandma wants to talk to you.

1066
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:21.330 line:82%
"Why have you forgotten Goddess?"

1067
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:22.830 line:82%
Yes, grandma?

1068
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:34.370 line:82%
Sweety, Sonu is saying that
there is a boy called Rahul who...

1069
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.370 line:82%
...you were earlier betrothed to?

1070
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:37.700 line:82%
- Grandma...
- Yes, grandma.

1071
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.740 line:82%
We were almost engaged.

1072
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:40.910 line:82%
You never informed us?

1073
00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:43.240 line:82%
I thought the agency
must have informed.

1074
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.580 line:82%
Rahul told Sonu some things
about why it was called off.

1075
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:49.450 line:82%
What did he say, mummy?

1076
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.950 line:82%
He must've said I was too controlling?

1077
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:53.830 line:82%
That I didn't trust him?

1078
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:55.120 line:82%
That I used to check his messages?

1079
00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.160 line:82%
After we got betrothed I
learned that he has a girlfriend.

1080
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.040 line:82%
Who he never officially broke up with.

1081
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.370 line:82%
For two months he kept asking
me for time...

1082
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.700 line:82%
...and kept talking to her under
the pretext of trying to break off.

1083
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.580 line:82%
He never asked for dowry.

1084
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.240 line:82%
Of course,
because all of us are quite modern.

1085
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.580 line:82%
Who asks for dowry nowadays?

1086
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.950 line:82%
He just got it conveyed
through the agency that...

1087
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.450 line:82%
...my parents would gift me a
'C Class' at least, as a wedding gift.

1088
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:22.450 line:82%
By their own wish.

1089
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:26.990 line:82%
Did he tell you what happened in Goa?

1090
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.830 line:82%
I got drunk, created a scene,

1091
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:32.540 line:82%
Embarrassed him.

1092
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:34.370 line:82%
Pushed him so hard...

1093
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.660 line:82%
That it broke his arm.

1094
00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.040 line:82%
He had taken me to Goa.

1095
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.700 line:82%
Saying that even though
it is an arranged marriage...

1096
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.580 line:82%
...he wants to propose to
me in a proper romantic manner.

1097
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.740 line:82%
After two drinks, he thought he
got permission to have sex with me.

1098
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:58.290 line:82%
He wanted to check
our sexual compatibility.

1099
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:02.290 line:82%
Very important for a married life,
apparently.

1100
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:05.490 line:82%
When I refused,
he forced himself upon me.

1101
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.370 line:82%
Hence I pushed him.

1102
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.540 line:82%
Did he mention that?

1103
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:20.910 line:82%
This topic shall never
be discussed again.

1104
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.450 line:82%
What happened?

1105
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:27.120 line:82%
Nothing, mummy.

1106
00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:30.290 line:82%
- Welcome.
- Come, dear.

1107
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:31.830 line:82%
Hello.

1108
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.830 line:82%
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1109
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:34.660 line:82%
Yes, sure.

1110
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:37.120 line:82%
Hello.

1111
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:51.080 line:82%
All the devotees are welcomed here.

1112
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:52.910 line:82%
Come on.

1113
00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:56.290 line:82%
"It is a very auspicious occasion."

1114
00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.910 line:82%
"It is a very auspicious night."

1115
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:03.450 line:82%
"Today we offer our prayers..."

1116
00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:06.660 line:82%
Titu...

1117
00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:08.290 line:82%
She had told me in
the first meeting itself.

1118
00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:11.990 line:82%
She said it was important that I know.

1119
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.830 line:82%
I didn't inform everyone because...

1120
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:17.040 line:82%
Because it's our personal matter

1121
00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.080 line:82%
You could have just asked me.

1122
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:33.790 line:82%
I thought we have that relation.

1123
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.790 line:82%
You doubt me?

1124
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:40.450 line:82%
Am I so bad?

1125
00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:50.330 line:82%
You know, when we got betrothed,
I told my mother that I found both...

1126
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:55.200 line:82%
A husband, as well as a brother.

1127
00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:00.040 line:82%
Go get ready.

1128
01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.540 line:82%
I must be the first bride ever to
be waiting for the groom on the stage.

1129
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.040 line:82%
Sonu wasn't ready.

1130
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.540 line:82%
Is he ready now?

1131
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:40.370 line:82%
I am.

1132
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:11.200 line:82%
"Yo yo Honey Singh!"

1133
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.910 line:82%
"Hey..."

1134
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:18.790 line:82%
"Hey..."

1135
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:25.120 line:82%
"Listen to last night's tale..."

1136
01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:27.490 line:82%
"I had some old red wine."

1137
01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.830 line:82%
"My friends tried to stop me..."

1138
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.370 line:82%
"I shouldn't get pushy."

1139
01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:34.540 line:82%
"Listen to last night's tale..."

1140
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:36.870 line:82%
"I had some old red wine."

1141
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.490 line:82%
"My friends tried to stop me..."

1142
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.870 line:82%
"I shouldn't get pushy."

1143
01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.410 line:82%
"I met an angel..."

1144
01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.740 line:82%
"She said, come close to me."

1145
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:51.790 line:82%
"Tell me, is your heart missing?"

1146
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:54.410 line:82%
"My heart got stolen..."

1147
01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.620 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1148
01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:58.990 line:82%
"My heart got stolen..."

1149
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.450 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1150
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:03.990 line:82%
"It's lost in someone's eyes..."

1151
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:06.330 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1152
01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:08.700 line:82%
"O madam, your gait..."

1153
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:11.160 line:82%
"Your silky tresses..."

1154
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.490 line:82%
"What more do I say?"

1155
01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.870 line:82%
"I got inebriated..."

1156
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.240 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1157
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.580 line:82%
"My heart got stolen..."

1158
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.410 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1159
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:27.620 line:82%
"All guys and girls will mingle..."

1160
01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.120 line:82%
"When they will go crazy
and come to the dance floor."

1161
01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:34.990 line:82%
"Everyone will shower money around..."

1162
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.620 line:82%
"And they will zoom
and make videos of it."

1163
01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.700 line:82%
"All my friends and cousins..."

1164
01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:44.160 line:82%
"Let's celebrate the
pre-wedding ritual..."

1165
01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.490 line:82%
"A single heart I too seek..."

1166
01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.700 line:82%
"For whom my heart shall beat."

1167
01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:51.080 line:82%
"Many would form new
relationships today..."

1168
01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.410 line:82%
"Those who are ogling around."

1169
01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:55.790 line:82%
"You too are eying me..."

1170
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:57.790 line:82%
"Tell me what do I do?"

1171
01:02:57.950 --> 01:03:00.290 line:82%
"My heart got stolen..."

1172
01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:02.740 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1173
01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:05.120 line:82%
"It's lost in someone's eyes..."

1174
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.490 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1175
01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.990 line:82%
"O madam, your gait..."

1176
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:12.160 line:82%
"Your silky tresses..."

1177
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.700 line:82%
"What more do I say?"

1178
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.200 line:82%
"I got inebriated..."

1179
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.540 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1180
01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.740 line:82%
"My heart got stolen..."

1181
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:24.410 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1182
01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.370 line:82%
"All..."

1183
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.410 line:82%
"All night,
all liquor, I finished it all."

1184
01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:31.910 line:82%
"If it's your friend's wedding,
come party with me."

1185
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:34.240 line:82%
"Tell me quietly, who'd hide shoes?"

1186
01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.620 line:82%
"Whoever does will get beaten up!"

1187
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.950 line:82%
"We have to create
a superb atmosphere."

1188
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:41.160 line:82%
"We also have to make
all aunts and uncles dance."

1189
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.790 line:82%
"We will have a lot of fun."

1190
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:46.200 line:82%
"Get drunk, no one will say a thing."

1191
01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:48.540 line:82%
"Girls get cajoled
in a Punjabi wedding..."

1192
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.990 line:82%
"There is free flowing liquor too."

1193
01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.490 line:82%
"As liquor is served,
it lasts till the end..."

1194
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.540 line:82%
"The catering guy will be in trouble,
my friend."

1195
01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.870 line:82%
"My heart got stolen..."

1196
01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:00.240 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1197
01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.580 line:82%
"My heart got stolen..."

1198
01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.950 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1199
01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.450 line:82%
"It's lost in someone's eyes..."

1200
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.950 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1201
01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.290 line:82%
"O madam, your gait..."

1202
01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:14.490 line:82%
"Your silky tresses..."

1203
01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.160 line:82%
"What more do I say?"

1204
01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:19.490 line:82%
"I got inebriated..."

1205
01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.870 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1206
01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.200 line:82%
"My heart got stolen..."

1207
01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:26.660 line:82%
"What do I do?"

1208
01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:29.410 line:82%
"Yo yo Honey Singh!"

1209
01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.370 line:82%
I am sorry.

1210
01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:58.700 line:82%
Why?

1211
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.370 line:82%
Because you think I am cunning?

1212
01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.080 line:82%
- No, I am...
- Well, I am.

1213
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:10.290 line:82%
Are you thinking...

1214
01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.790 line:82%
...why I'm telling this to you now?

1215
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:17.450 line:82%
Just. I feel like
showing you your place.

1216
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:22.660 line:82%
Go, run, and tell Titu...

1217
01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:24.490 line:82%
Go.

1218
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.200 line:82%
What happened?

1219
01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040 line:82%
Titu won't believe you?

1220
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:32.830 line:82%
But you are his best
friend since childhood, right?

1221
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.580 line:82%
And I have just come into your lives.

1222
01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:37.910 line:82%
Go.

1223
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:43.950 line:82%
The engagement is done.

1224
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:46.240 line:82%
So will the marriage.

1225
01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:49.620 line:82%
And guess who'll be the first person
to get kicked out of Titu's life?

1226
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:01.490 line:82%
It's very nice.

1227
01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:03.490 line:82%
Do you like it, grandma?

1228
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:04.790 line:82%
It's beautiful, dear.

1229
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.660 line:82%
Get it registered and
start with the interiors.

1230
01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.040 line:82%
Under whose name will the registry be?

1231
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.200 line:82%
Under a joint name.

1232
01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:12.700 line:82%
What do you mean by joint names?

1233
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.040 line:82%
Yeah, Titu and mine.

1234
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:22.450 line:82%
I am leaving my house
and my family to be with him.

1235
01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.620 line:82%
The least I can get
is a little security.

1236
01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.290 line:82%
You talk about security?

1237
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:29.290 line:82%
You don't think there should be some
trust in your future in-laws?

1238
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:30.790 line:82%
Trust is a two-way street, mummy.

1239
01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:33.160 line:82%
If it's about trust then why don't
we register it under my name alone?

1240
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:34.790 line:82%
Did you hear what she said?

1241
01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:36.990 line:82%
They aren't even married yet and she
is already talking about separation?

1242
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:38.490 line:82%
I always knew this
family is the wrong family

1243
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.160 line:82%
Who talks about splitting the wedding
expenses in the first meeting itself?

1244
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.040 line:82%
What kind of a family have you
forged a relationship with, sister?

1245
01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.870 line:82%
Titu is my grandson too!

1246
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.540 line:82%
I am not letting this happen!

1247
01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.910 line:82%
Enough!

1248
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:55.580 line:82%
All property registries in
this family have only seen one name.

1249
01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.080 line:82%
Ghasitaram.

1250
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.450 line:82%
Go inform your father,
that this wedding...

1251
01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.790 line:82%
...stands canceled!

1252
01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.330 line:82%
What do you mean by joint names?

1253
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:27.370 line:82%
We've decided that our first home
should be in the names of the people...

1254
01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.950 line:82%
...because of whom
this has been possible.

1255
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.120 line:82%
Ma and grandma.

1256
01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:38.950 line:82%
You mean Ma and grandma will
have to stand in the registry queue?

1257
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:40.990 line:82%
If they have to stand in the
queue when we have uncle Lalu...

1258
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.660 line:82%
...then it's a shame,
right, uncle Lalu?

1259
01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:48.370 line:82%
The loan will get cleared on Monday.

1260
01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.870 line:82%
We will register it on Wednesday.

1261
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:50.830 line:82%
Loan?

1262
01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.540 line:82%
Grandpa, you have
set up everything for us.

1263
01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.240 line:82%
We wanted to build this house,
slowly, with our own money.

1264
01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:01.910 line:82%
What do you mean with your own money?

1265
01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.910 line:82%
Who does this money belong to?

1266
01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.290 line:82%
You've learned to
act like grown-ups now?

1267
01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:07.450 line:82%
Lalu...

1268
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.080 line:82%
Yes.

1269
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.450 line:82%
Make the full payment
tomorrow itself...

1270
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.290 line:82%
...and have it registered
under Sweety and Titu's name.

1271
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:14.830 line:82%
We have built a house not to
see that my grand-daughter-in-law...

1272
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.290 line:82%
...comes in a house bought with loan.

1273
01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:18.830 line:82%
- Lalu...
- Yes

1274
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.370 line:82%
Make sure Sweety doesn't
have to go anywhere.

1275
01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:42.450 line:82%
Yes.

1276
01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.120 line:82%
They are going to make
the payment for the new house.

1277
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:47.160 line:82%
Ask grandma for fifty cash.

1278
01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:01.370 line:82%
Grandma,
need fifty cash for the house.

1279
01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.410 line:82%
- Lalu...
- Sweety...

1280
01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:26.990 line:82%
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1281
01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.660 line:82%
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1282
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:34.040 line:82%
"Don't move like a bullet."

1283
01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.910 line:82%
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1284
01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.240 line:82%
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1285
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:46.790 line:82%
"Don't move like a bullet."

1286
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.450 line:82%
"Twisty-curvy is the road."

1287
01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:52.830 line:82%
"Your speed is on super fast mode."

1288
01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:54.790 line:82%
"There is no brake on your sandals."

1289
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:57.660 line:82%
"Oh my God... oh my God..."

1290
01:10:57.790 --> 01:11:01.700 line:82%
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1291
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:06.200 line:82%
"Don't move like a bullet."

1292
01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.740 line:82%
"This world is rude."

1293
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:12.410 line:82%
"Oh my..."

1294
01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.580 line:82%
"This world is rude."

1295
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:16.740 line:82%
"They will tease."

1296
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:19.120 line:82%
"Don't run like this..."

1297
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:21.450 line:82%
"Listen to me, please."

1298
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.870 line:82%
Sweety... just a sec please.

1299
01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.080 line:82%
Hmm?

1300
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.790 line:82%
You've chosen the wrong battle.

1301
01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:56.290 line:82%
Well, the choice is made now.

1302
01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.450 line:82%
But it's a sweet battle.

1303
01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:00.120 line:82%
No one can hear you

1304
01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:01.660 line:82%
Why're you acting?

1305
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:03.120 line:82%
Acting?

1306
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:04.660 line:82%
What do you mean?

1307
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:06.490 line:82%
What are you saying, Sonu?

1308
01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.040 line:82%
You can try as much as you want.

1309
01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.700 line:82%
I promise you I'll
break this marriage off.

1310
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:13.700 line:82%
What is wrong with you, Sonu?

1311
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:16.580 line:82%
Please say that you're lying...

1312
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.450 line:82%
That you're joking.

1313
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.870 line:82%
She is so cheap, Ghasitey,

1314
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:45.200 line:82%
She has started recording
our conversations.

1315
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:46.540 line:82%
You do the same.

1316
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:49.200 line:82%
It is not ethical.

1317
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:51.580 line:82%
I can't forget my ethics for this.

1318
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:53.740 line:82%
What what would be the
difference between me and her then?

1319
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.660 line:82%
Come Sonu,
Sweety has made curry for us.

1320
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.040 line:82%
Sorry, Sweety,

1321
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.700 line:82%
I brought kebabs.

1322
01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:25.040 line:82%
Nothing beats kebabs!

1323
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:49.700 line:82%
Today I will make chicken
for Sonu and grandpa.

1324
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:50.370 line:82%
Oh!

1325
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:51.540 line:82%
They love it, don't they?

1326
01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:52.370 line:82%
Absolutely.

1327
01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:42.620 line:82%
Rukmani, you asked me not
to eat meat on Tuesdays and I agreed.

1328
01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:44.330 line:82%
But this is so not fair!

1329
01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:46.330 line:82%
- Lalu...
- Sister.

1330
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:47.620 line:82%
Throw it.

1331
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:50.330 line:82%
But this one is already dead!

1332
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.330 line:82%
Will you let its sacrifice go in vain?

1333
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:54.490 line:82%
Lalu, you are under the oath of...

1334
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:08.040 line:82%
No meat will be cooked or
brought inside this house henceforth.

1335
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.950 line:82%
Come on Manju, let's have dinner.

1336
01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:18.120 line:82%
- Well, I...
- Have an upset stomach?

1337
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:22.490 line:82%
I know where you go for your walks.

1338
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.120 line:82%
Quietly eat the dinner
or else I will tell grandma...

1339
01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.540 line:82%
...that the bond she shares with her
brother was traded for four percent.

1340
01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.080 line:82%
Sweety has made Soya Chaap.

1341
01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240 line:82%
At least try it.

1342
01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:39.540 line:82%
They call it veg mutton.

1343
01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.950 line:82%
In Mayur Vihar, a boy promised a girl
to get married, and had sex with her.

1344
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:24.450 line:82%
But didn't marry her.

1345
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:25.950 line:82%
So?

1346
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:27.790 line:82%
He's in jail now

1347
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:31.790 line:82%
Under section 375 it
is a punishable offense to...

1348
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:33.870 line:82%
...have sex by giving
a false promise of marriage.

1349
01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.040 line:82%
Why are you telling me that?

1350
01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:37.040 line:82%
Just.

1351
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:38.700 line:82%
It was in the news.

1352
01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:41.370 line:82%
Yes!

1353
01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.080 line:82%
You will lose.

1354
01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.830 line:82%
Excuse me.

1355
01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.290 line:82%
I will be right back.

1356
01:17:58.290 --> 01:17:59.450 line:82%
Where are you going?

1357
01:17:59.790 --> 01:18:00.290 line:82%
Inside.

1358
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:02.950 line:82%
There is hardly any
time left for the wedding.

1359
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:04.790 line:82%
Don't do it.

1360
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:06.490 line:82%
What if she objects?

1361
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:07.990 line:82%
Have you lost your mind?

1362
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:09.330 line:82%
I am just...

1363
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:11.160 line:82%
I'm not going that far.

1364
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.330 line:82%
Relax...

1365
01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:14.950 line:82%
What happened?

1366
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:18.160 line:82%
I don't know.

1367
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:21.200 line:82%
I don't know what happened to me.

1368
01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.410 line:82%
What will she think of me now?

1369
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.990 line:82%
It's okay.

1370
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:59.200 line:82%
It's okay.

1371
01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:04.580 line:82%
I know we decided to wait but it's us.

1372
01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.580 line:82%
I am already your wife, right?

1373
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:11.950 line:82%
We just make it official
on 22nd October.

1374
01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.120 line:82%
I am sorry.

1375
01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:16.790 line:82%
Are you mad?

1376
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:33.870 line:82%
I love you.

1377
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:36.910 line:82%
I love you too.

1378
01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.790 line:82%
Now go and get ready.

1379
01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:44.950 line:82%
Drop me home.

1380
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:03.870 line:82%
I am not the heroine...

1381
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.040 line:82%
I am the villain.

1382
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:08.040 line:82%
Villain.

1383
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:13.870 line:82%
"Yes, I'm a villain"

1384
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:22.450 line:82%
"I am not the hero, I am the villain!"

1385
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:30.490 line:82%
"I am not the hero, I am the villain!"

1386
01:21:32.490 --> 01:21:36.540 line:82%
"I am cruel and vicious."

1387
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:40.540 line:82%
"I don't know about love."

1388
01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:45.410 line:82%
"I'm just worthy of hatred."

1389
01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:51.740 line:82%
"I am not the hero, I am the villain!"

1390
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:55.950 line:82%
"I am cruel and vicious."

1391
01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:01.830 line:82%
Ghasitey, she's won me over.

1392
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.330 line:82%
What is wrong with him?

1393
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:04.950 line:82%
He is in shock.

1394
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:09.870 line:82%
She made Titu do what
she wanted him to do.

1395
01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.540 line:82%
And she made him do it in such a
way that Titu thinks he did it.

1396
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:17.410 line:82%
And Titu thinks that what he did
is wrong.

1397
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:22.450 line:82%
Then to make Titu apologize,
she first forgave him.

1398
01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:27.450 line:82%
And when Titu started to apologize,
she even stopped him from doing that.

1399
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:30.330 line:82%
Hats off to that girl.

1400
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.620 line:82%
We should be taking lessons from her.

1401
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:34.620 line:82%
This woman is the
greatest manipulator.

1402
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:37.830 line:82%
She deserves it, Ghasitey.

1403
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:39.330 line:82%
Let her get married.

1404
01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:40.490 line:82%
What do you mean 'let her'?

1405
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:41.540 line:82%
I am not stopping her.

1406
01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:42.870 line:82%
You cannot stop her either.

1407
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200 line:82%
I don't want to either.

1408
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:45.540 line:82%
You're not even capable of it.

1409
01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.540 line:82%
Lalu... how old are you?

1410
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:51.910 line:82%
68.

1411
01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.370 line:82%
You couldn't pull it for 28, kid.

1412
01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.620 line:82%
I underestimated her.

1413
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:05.290 line:82%
Now I don't know how to prove it.

1414
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:06.120 line:82%
Look...

1415
01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:09.950 line:82%
When you are losing the race,
it is better if you pretend to fall...

1416
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:12.490 line:82%
You get an excuse for your failure.

1417
01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.700 line:82%
You should back off.

1418
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:16.870 line:82%
At least you will be
able to console yourself...

1419
01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.830 line:82%
...that if you had fully tried, you
could have broken off their marriage.

1420
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:23.910 line:82%
Here...

1421
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:26.240 line:82%
No ice, sore throat.

1422
01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.080 line:82%
Have it, you will feel better.

1423
01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.910 line:82%
Poison fights poison.

1424
01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:56.410 line:82%
Titu, where is your passport?

1425
01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:57.410 line:82%
Right here, why?

1426
01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:58.580 line:82%
We are going to Amsterdam.

1427
01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.240 line:82%
Not even 10 days left for the wedding

1428
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:01.410 line:82%
They want to go to Amsterdam.

1429
01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.580 line:82%
This isn't a discussion.

1430
01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:03.240 line:82%
I am informing everyone.

1431
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:04.080 line:82%
Everything will be arranged.

1432
01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.290 line:82%
No one is going anywhere.

1433
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:06.580 line:82%
The band is not finalized.

1434
01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:07.950 line:82%
Titu hasn't done the final
trial for his wedding outfit.

1435
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:11.830 line:82%
Mummy, forget Meerut, even
if I bring the best band in India...

1436
01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.120 line:82%
...they too will play
just that one song on repeat.

1437
01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.450 line:82%
"This country of young brave men..."

1438
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:19.660 line:82%
And I promise that the groom
won't show up in his knickers.

1439
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:22.370 line:82%
I will have a tailor on location.

1440
01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.700 line:82%
He has been possessed.

1441
01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040 line:82%
I have agreed to everything till now

1442
01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:27.870 line:82%
But this is nonnegotiable

1443
01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:31.740 line:82%
I am not letting Titu get
married without a bachelor party.

1444
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:37.580 line:82%
Sweety, you tell them,
don't we deserve a bachelor party?

1445
01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:41.620 line:82%
How can I refuse?

1446
01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:43.950 line:82%
I am stealing your
friend away from you.

1447
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:45.990 line:82%
I have to give you at least that much.

1448
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.990 line:82%
Sweety...

1449
01:24:51.330 --> 01:24:52.660 line:82%
I am mailing you the itinerary.

1450
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:56.040 line:82%
You'll book the tickets
for this, right?

1451
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:19.990 line:82%
They have hardly faced the real world.

1452
01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:21.830 line:82%
They are only kids.

1453
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.290 line:82%
They have just aged a little.

1454
01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:25.990 line:82%
They've never been to Bangkok.

1455
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.540 line:82%
I hope they don't go
overboard in Amsterdam.

1456
01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:31.700 line:82%
There's hardly any
days left for the wedding.

1457
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.200 line:82%
Are you understanding?

1458
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:35.700 line:82%
Yes, I am.

1459
01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:36.870 line:82%
Lalu...

1460
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:37.580 line:82%
Yes!

1461
01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.910 line:82%
Get your passports.

1462
01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.240 line:82%
You too will go with him.

1463
01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.410 line:82%
But there is a lot of
work to be done here as well.

1464
01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:47.580 line:82%
Let him go alone.

1465
01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.290 line:82%
I can smell it burning.

1466
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:50.120 line:82%
Right.

1467
01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:51.790 line:82%
You stay back then.

1468
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:57.330 line:82%
Your medicines?

1469
01:25:57.490 --> 01:25:58.700 line:82%
Write them down for him.

1470
01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:04.040 line:82%
And outside food...?

1471
01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.700 line:82%
It's Europe, Lalu.

1472
01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.700 line:82%
Even outside food is healthy there.

1473
01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:11.410 line:82%
Yes.

1474
01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:13.580 line:82%
You want to go?

1475
01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:14.740 line:82%
Yes.

1476
01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.740 line:82%
Then stop the drama.

1477
01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.450 line:82%
Okay, sister.

1478
01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.620 line:82%
Hey, you!

1479
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:20.950 line:82%
Come.

1480
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:26.160 line:82%
We fly business.

1481
01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:28.120 line:82%
Go.

1482
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:32.830 line:82%
"She has long silky hair."

1483
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:35.160 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1484
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:36.660 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1485
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:40.370 line:82%
"She has an awesome
tattoo on her waist."

1486
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:42.700 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1487
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:44.660 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1488
01:28:04.290 --> 01:28:05.290 line:82%
Hi!

1489
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.990 line:82%
Hi.

1490
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:07.160 line:82%
Congrats.

1491
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:07.990 line:82%
For?

1492
01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:09.160 line:82%
For?

1493
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:10.990 line:82%
Forgotten as soon
as you reached Amsterdam?

1494
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:12.330 line:82%
Sonu told me that
you're getting married.

1495
01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:13.490 line:82%
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1496
01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.200 line:82%
Thanks.

1497
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:15.540 line:82%
So, what's her name?

1498
01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.490 line:82%
Sweety Sharma.

1499
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:18.040 line:82%
Already Sharma?

1500
01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.370 line:82%
No, she is also a Sharma.

1501
01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.080 line:82%
I mean from before.

1502
01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.540 line:82%
From before!

1503
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:25.240 line:82%
Perfect.

1504
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.540 line:82%
What are you doing here?

1505
01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.910 line:82%
Holiday!

1506
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:29.740 line:82%
With whom?

1507
01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.330 line:82%
I've come alone.

1508
01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:42.490 line:82%
Excuse me.

1509
01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.540 line:82%
'I've come alone.'

1510
01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.540 line:82%
'I've come alone!'

1511
01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:01.040 line:82%
It's not a sad statement.

1512
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.040 line:82%
You're supposed to look happy.

1513
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.410 line:82%
I've come alone!

1514
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:07.950 line:82%
What happened?

1515
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:09.790 line:82%
Stop crying, Pihu.
What if Titu sees you?

1516
01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.290 line:82%
What do you mean stop it?

1517
01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:12.490 line:82%
It's not a tap!

1518
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:13.990 line:82%
It's just happening!

1519
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:16.660 line:82%
Look, if you cry he will think
that you still have feelings for him.

1520
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:18.330 line:82%
But I do.

1521
01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:19.660 line:82%
That's why I am here.

1522
01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.660 line:82%
Yes, but he cannot know that.

1523
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:23.700 line:82%
You need to show him
that you have moved on.

1524
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:25.870 line:82%
Only then will he spend time with you.

1525
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.040 line:82%
Look, be it a girl or a boy...

1526
01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.910 line:82%
...one feels sad about losing
their ex only when they see them happy.

1527
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.580 line:82%
Only then you feel
like getting him back.

1528
01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:33.540 line:82%
Try to understand.

1529
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:35.740 line:82%
He is happy with Sweety, Sonu.

1530
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:37.450 line:82%
I saw it in his eyes.

1531
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:39.620 line:82%
And I am here dancing in
a backless dress for no reason!

1532
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:41.290 line:82%
Hey, listen, calm down.

1533
01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:43.290 line:82%
Does anyone know Titu better than me?

1534
01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:45.450 line:82%
He still loves you.

1535
01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.120 line:82%
He's getting married in a rebound.

1536
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.490 line:82%
And he doesn't realize it either.

1537
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:51.830 line:82%
I've always believed that
you and Titu are made for each other.

1538
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:54.200 line:82%
And it just got confirmed
when I saw him with Sweety.

1539
01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.540 line:82%
And the way he looked at you today...

1540
01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:00.370 line:82%
I was sure that if Titu belongs
to a girl, that girl is Pihu!

1541
01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.540 line:82%
Please don't get distracted.

1542
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:05.080 line:82%
Let me strategize this.

1543
01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.540 line:82%
You stay in your character.

1544
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:08.790 line:82%
I brought you here, right?

1545
01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:11.950 line:82%
I guarantee you that
I'll get you Titu.

1546
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:13.290 line:82%
I promise.

1547
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:15.950 line:82%
Just do as I say.

1548
01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:17.290 line:82%
Got it?

1549
01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:18.950 line:82%
Now wipe your tears...

1550
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.330 line:82%
And come two minutes after me...

1551
01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:22.990 line:82%
...and say you
got a call from Anshul.

1552
01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:24.290 line:82%
Who's Anshul?

1553
01:30:24.330 --> 01:30:25.660 line:82%
The guy from your office.

1554
01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.200 line:82%
I don't see the connection.

1555
01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:28.330 line:82%
Again?

1556
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:29.870 line:82%
You won't get Titu like this.

1557
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.330 line:82%
You won't be able to
do this if you overthink.

1558
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:33.540 line:82%
You want Titu, right?

1559
01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.370 line:82%
Then follow me.

1560
01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:38.080 line:82%
Huh... follow...

1561
01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.040 line:82%
Come after two minutes.

1562
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:46.950 line:82%
- Did you see her anywhere?
- No.

1563
01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.120 line:82%
Two shots, please.

1564
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.950 line:82%
I think she got a little
uncomfortable seeing me.

1565
01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:55.950 line:82%
Hi.

1566
01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.660 line:82%
Sorry, had to attend a call.

1567
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:00.830 line:82%
Boyfriend?

1568
01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.040 line:82%
Anshul.

1569
01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.040 line:82%
Y'all have met him too.

1570
01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.200 line:82%
Oh yes, at the pub, right?

1571
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:10.910 line:82%
Shots!

1572
01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:20.950 line:82%
My song!

1573
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:34.870 line:82%
Now just get drunk and make a mess!

1574
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.990 line:82%
I'll handle the rest.

1575
01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.870 line:82%
They're crooks,
mixing water in the drinks.

1576
01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.410 line:82%
8 shots down,
haven't even started to feel drunk.

1577
01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:43.080 line:82%
And now you're a method actor.

1578
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.080 line:82%
Can't even pretend to be drunk.

1579
01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.540 line:82%
He's looking here.

1580
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:50.240 line:82%
Shall I call him?

1581
01:31:50.410 --> 01:31:51.450 line:82%
Not yet, wait.

1582
01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:56.290 line:82%
Now. Call him.

1583
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:59.990 line:82%
Drag him here.

1584
01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.040 line:82%
You are getting married.

1585
01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:14.910 line:82%
Come on.

1586
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:30.120 line:82%
What is this?

1587
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:31.950 line:82%
Poison.

1588
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:35.490 line:82%
You told me, remember?

1589
01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:37.330 line:82%
That only poison fights poison.

1590
01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:43.830 line:82%
How is this poison
better than that poison?

1591
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:45.540 line:82%
I have tasted this poison.

1592
01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:48.870 line:82%
And even spewed it out when needed.

1593
01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:51.240 line:82%
And most importantly, Ghasitey...

1594
01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.040 line:82%
She never challenged me.

1595
01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:00.790 line:82%
Come on, let's go.

1596
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:02.790 line:82%
Ghasitey didn't like this place.
We're leaving.

1597
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:04.660 line:82%
Shots! Shots!

1598
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:05.790 line:82%
No!

1599
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:07.330 line:82%
She's coming with us?

1600
01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:10.490 line:82%
You want to leave
her alone in this state?

1601
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:13.990 line:82%
I mean it's your call.

1602
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:16.540 line:82%
I can tell her not to
come if you feel uncomfortable.

1603
01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.700 line:82%
Titu... Titu...

1604
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:53.040 line:82%
Titu... Titu...

1605
01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.790 line:82%
Just a moment...

1606
01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:10.620 line:82%
Good night.

1607
01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:15.990 line:82%
- Titu, you are so sweet.
- Okay.

1608
01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:16.990 line:82%
Go to sleep.

1609
01:34:18.330 --> 01:34:19.330 line:82%
Good night.

1610
01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:29.740 line:82%
Yes, Sweety?

1611
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:31.370 line:82%
- Sonu?
- My sister-in-law!

1612
01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:32.910 line:82%
Titu is at his bachelor party.

1613
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:33.870 line:82%
He cannot take your call.

1614
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:34.370 line:82%
Give it to me.

1615
01:34:34.410 --> 01:34:35.950 line:82%
No phone calls for
the next three days.

1616
01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:37.950 line:82%
Don't you worry.

1617
01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.790 line:82%
I took good care of him
before you showed up, didn't I?

1618
01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.580 line:82%
I can do that for
another three days too.

1619
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:43.450 line:82%
Bye.

1620
01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:47.330 line:82%
No phone calls for
the next three days.

1621
01:34:59.370 --> 01:35:03.240 line:82%
"She has long silky hair."

1622
01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.580 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1623
01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.080 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1624
01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.740 line:82%
"She has an awesome
tattoo on her waist."

1625
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:13.080 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1626
01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.450 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1627
01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:18.290 line:82%
"She has long silky hair."

1628
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:20.620 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1629
01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:21.990 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1630
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:25.830 line:82%
"She has an awesome
tattoo on her waist."

1631
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:28.040 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1632
01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:29.330 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1633
01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:33.200 line:82%
"I fell for you, how is it my fault?"

1634
01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.040 line:82%
"You are my love, how is my fault?"

1635
01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.740 line:82%
"What do you feel about me?"

1636
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:43.080 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1637
01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.950 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1638
01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:03.870 line:82%
"Your attitude is worth millions."

1639
01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.870 line:82%
"Your swag is out of this world."

1640
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:10.740 line:82%
"She's causing a storm in the club."

1641
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:13.040 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1642
01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.370 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1643
01:36:14.410 --> 01:36:17.790 line:82%
"She has long silky hair."

1644
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:20.580 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1645
01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.290 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1646
01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.700 line:82%
"Why don't you open
your heart for me?"

1647
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:37.700 line:82%
"Why don't you say
sweet nothings to me?"

1648
01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:41.700 line:82%
"Why don't you...?"

1649
01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.950 line:82%
"Why don't you open
your heart for me?"

1650
01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.950 line:82%
"Why don't you say
sweet nothings to me?"

1651
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:55.790 line:82%
"She is still a mystery for me."

1652
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:57.950 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1653
01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.490 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1654
01:36:59.490 --> 01:37:03.160 line:82%
"She has long silky hair."

1655
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:05.490 line:82%
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1656
01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:06.990 line:82%
"Who's dancing there?"

1657
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:22.040 line:82%
Done packing?

1658
01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.290 line:82%
Yes, done.

1659
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:28.290 line:82%
I really had a great time.

1660
01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.290 line:82%
Me too.

1661
01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:29.950 line:82%
Liar.

1662
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:31.620 line:82%
I ruined your party.

1663
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:33.490 line:82%
You got stuck with
your ex at your bachelor's.

1664
01:37:33.490 --> 01:37:34.790 line:82%
Didn't even get to do anything.

1665
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:35.990 line:82%
I didn't want to do anything.

1666
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:38.990 line:82%
But I just feel weird
that Sweety doesn't know.

1667
01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.200 line:82%
You didn't tell her?

1668
01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:42.040 line:82%
Sonu has my phone since
the past three days.

1669
01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:44.490 line:82%
But I think she'll be fine.

1670
01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:46.540 line:82%
So what will you tell her?

1671
01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.700 line:82%
That we are friends now?

1672
01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:49.910 line:82%
What are you two talking about?

1673
01:37:50.410 --> 01:37:52.040 line:82%
This scoundrel says
that we are friends now.

1674
01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.040 line:82%
He is getting married...
and hasn't even invited me for it.

1675
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:55.080 line:82%
And he says that we are friends.

1676
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.450 line:82%
What are you saying?

1677
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:57.910 line:82%
Who is he to invite you?

1678
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:59.120 line:82%
I am inviting you.

1679
01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:00.620 line:82%
Please be my guest.

1680
01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:03.410 line:82%
Only you truly love me!

1681
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:05.790 line:82%
Okay then, I'll go and pack.

1682
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:11.290 line:82%
Have you lost it?

1683
01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:12.490 line:82%
What?

1684
01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.700 line:82%
Why would you invite her?

1685
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:16.040 line:82%
The way she said it,
did I have a choice?

1686
01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:17.990 line:82%
But why are you worried?

1687
01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:20.910 line:82%
Tell me the truth...

1688
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:23.080 line:82%
Do you still have feelings for her?

1689
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.580 line:82%
Are you mad?

1690
01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:26.580 line:82%
It just feels a little odd.

1691
01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:29.450 line:82%
Look, if you have no feelings for
her then there's no problem.

1692
01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:32.290 line:82%
But if you have a problem, then
that means that you have feelings.

1693
01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:33.790 line:82%
You decide.

1694
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:34.950 line:82%
I can ask her not to come, but...

1695
01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.080 line:82%
Let her come.

1696
01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:36.990 line:82%
As you wish.

1697
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:16.830 line:82%
Sweety, you! Here!

1698
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:18.290 line:82%
What a surprise!

1699
01:39:18.330 --> 01:39:19.830 line:82%
Sweety, Pihu.

1700
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:21.990 line:82%
A very old friend of Titu's.

1701
01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:22.870 line:82%
I know.

1702
01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:24.870 line:82%
Titu told me

1703
01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:26.870 line:82%
Hi.

1704
01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:30.240 line:82%
We bumped into her.

1705
01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.580 line:82%
She was coming back to Delhi,
so I invited her for the wedding.

1706
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:37.240 line:82%
- Hi, I am Shalu, Sweety's cousin.
- Pihu. Hi.

1707
01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:38.620 line:82%
Shall we?

1708
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:57.040 line:82%
Come, Titu.

1709
01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.580 line:82%
Sister-in-law Pihu...

1710
01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.080 line:82%
Sister, how are you?

1711
01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.410 line:82%
- How are you, Babbu?
- Fine.

1712
01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:46.450 line:82%
How is you mother-in-law?

1713
01:40:46.450 --> 01:40:46.950 line:82%
Good.

1714
01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:47.950 line:82%
Good.

1715
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:51.120 line:82%
Keep it in.

1716
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:53.830 line:82%
Come on...

1717
01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:56.160 line:82%
Get the bags.

1718
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:08.910 line:82%
"Go for it!"

1719
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:22.450 line:82%
You had made tall
claims before leaving.

1720
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:24.160 line:82%
"I'll do this! I'll do that!"

1721
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:25.290 line:82%
Where's your tailor?

1722
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:26.790 line:82%
Grandma was right.

1723
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:28.990 line:82%
You only know how to ruin weddings.

1724
01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.330 line:82%
Isn't that her?

1725
01:41:33.330 --> 01:41:34.160 line:82%
Who?

1726
01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:36.870 line:82%
When did you meet her?

1727
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:38.540 line:82%
I have Facebook too.

1728
01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.200 line:82%
What is she doing her?

1729
01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:42.040 line:82%
We bumped into her.

1730
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:42.740 line:82%
She was coming back to Delhi,

1731
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:43.910 line:82%
Titu invited her for the wedding.

1732
01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:47.040 line:82%
Every half an hour mummy
gets these dhols started.

1733
01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:50.080 line:82%
Even the Ghazal night yesterday
became a Bhangra night.

1734
01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:50.950 line:82%
What?

1735
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:51.950 line:82%
Mummy!

1736
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:54.080 line:82%
Who is she?

1737
01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.120 line:82%
Pihu.

1738
01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:56.990 line:82%
Oh!

1739
01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.660 line:82%
- Who is she?
- What?

1740
01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:02.660 line:82%
Who is she?

1741
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:04.490 line:82%
She's Titu and Sonu's friend.

1742
01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.040 line:82%
Is she single?

1743
01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.200 line:82%
- Titu, my bag.
- Grandma...

1744
01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:12.870 line:82%
Grandma, Pihu.

1745
01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:15.040 line:82%
An old friend of ours.

1746
01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:15.700 line:82%
We bumped into her.

1747
01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:16.540 line:82%
She was coming back to Delhi.

1748
01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:17.540 line:82%
So we invited her for the wedding.

1749
01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:18.740 line:82%
Very good.

1750
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:20.080 line:82%
She is a very nice girl.

1751
01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:21.740 line:82%
You will be staying with us, right?

1752
01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:23.740 line:82%
- Yes, I mean...
- Stay with us.

1753
01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:24.740 line:82%
Okay.

1754
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:25.790 line:82%
I have a dance performance
on the musical night.

1755
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:26.620 line:82%
You teach me.

1756
01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:28.120 line:82%
Just dance, grandma?

1757
01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.410 line:82%
You should hear her sing.

1758
01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:30.660 line:82%
She is an amazing singer.

1759
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:31.330 line:82%
Oh.

1760
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:35.490 line:82%
"This... this is a world of brass..."

1761
01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.830 line:82%
"This is a world of brass..."

1762
01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.490 line:82%
"And I am a golden baby doll."

1763
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:42.700 line:82%
"I am a golden baby doll."

1764
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:44.040 line:82%
"I am a golden baby doll."

1765
01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:44.870 line:82%
Oh.

1766
01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.410 line:82%
"I am a golden baby doll."

1767
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:49.240 line:82%
I'll get you some water.

1768
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:50.040 line:82%
Yes, dear.

1769
01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:54.240 line:82%
- Grandma...
- Hey.

1770
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:57.450 line:82%
Come, I'll show you your room.

1771
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:04.450 line:82%
Oh! I'm so exhausted.

1772
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:07.160 line:82%
Have you lost your mind, Titu?

1773
01:43:07.290 --> 01:43:09.290 line:82%
Who invites their ex-girlfriend
for their wedding?

1774
01:43:09.330 --> 01:43:11.120 line:82%
How will Sweety's family
react when they find out?

1775
01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:12.830 line:82%
- I didn't...
- She cannot stay here.

1776
01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:14.040 line:82%
If Titu doesn't have a problem,
why are you...

1777
01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.040 line:82%
Does Sweety know?

1778
01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:15.540 line:82%
Know what?

1779
01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.540 line:82%
That she is his ex?

1780
01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:18.040 line:82%
Of course she knows.

1781
01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.540 line:82%
He never hides anything from Sweety.

1782
01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.040 line:82%
Titu may not have
a problem but Sweety can.

1783
01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:21.700 line:82%
Oh.

1784
01:43:22.410 --> 01:43:23.240 line:82%
Sweety.

1785
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:24.240 line:82%
What are you doing?

1786
01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:26.910 line:82%
What are you doing?

1787
01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:32.450 line:82%
Mummy feels that you might
have a problem with Pihu staying here.

1788
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:35.790 line:82%
Not at all, mummy.

1789
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:36.450 line:82%
Happy?

1790
01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:38.290 line:82%
They have already become friends.

1791
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:51.700 line:82%
Do you think that Titu
still has feelings for Pihu?

1792
01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:01.910 line:82%
"She's a golden baby doll."

1793
01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.450 line:82%
"She's a golden baby doll."

1794
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:15.490 line:82%
That sari was looking good on you.

1795
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:19.490 line:82%
I never wore one after the betrothal.

1796
01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.540 line:82%
So I thought I should...

1797
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:22.870 line:82%
Then why did you change?

1798
01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:25.540 line:82%
Uncomfortable.

1799
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:29.540 line:82%
Should I ask Pihu not to stay here?

1800
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:31.410 line:82%
What if she agrees?

1801
01:44:32.370 --> 01:44:33.040 line:82%
Why?

1802
01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:35.450 line:82%
No chance.

1803
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:37.410 line:82%
Uncomfortable?

1804
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:39.450 line:82%
Are you?

1805
01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:41.120 line:82%
No.

1806
01:44:41.290 --> 01:44:43.080 line:82%
She'll look weak if she agrees.

1807
01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.290 line:82%
Then why will I be?

1808
01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:57.660 line:82%
Go and change.

1809
01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:58.870 line:82%
Why?

1810
01:44:59.040 --> 01:44:59.870 line:82%
Go.

1811
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:01.540 line:82%
Okay.

1812
01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:07.410 line:82%
Hey...

1813
01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.040 line:82%
Where to?

1814
01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:08.740 line:82%
Shopping.

1815
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.580 line:82%
I can't wear my Amsterdam
clothes at the wedding.

1816
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:13.910 line:82%
Come on, sister-in-law.

1817
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:18.120 line:82%
Oh!

1818
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:55.830 line:82%
Can I ask you something?

1819
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.490 line:82%
Hmm.

1820
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:02.040 line:82%
What's the difference
between Sweety and me?

1821
01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.370 line:82%
Does she love you more?

1822
01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:10.910 line:82%
Does she take better care of you?

1823
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:13.740 line:82%
Why do you ask?

1824
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:14.540 line:82%
Just.

1825
01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:16.620 line:82%
Just want to know.

1826
01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:20.120 line:82%
What is it that I did?
Or what it is I did not do?

1827
01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:23.620 line:82%
That it's her name on the
wedding card instead of mine.

1828
01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:42.700 line:82%
(Laughter)

1829
01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:43.910 line:82%
How've you been?

1830
01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:44.580 line:82%
I hate doing this.

1831
01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:47.040 line:82%
- But we will do it.
- Sure.

1832
01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:51.450 line:82%
Hold on.

1833
01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.290 line:82%
Let me know if anyone needs
anything.

1834
01:46:54.450 --> 01:46:55.450 line:82%
Titu's near home.

1835
01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:56.620 line:82%
Can he go to Sarojini?

1836
01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:58.620 line:82%
Why not, auntie? Of course he can.

1837
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:59.830 line:82%
I'll message the address.

1838
01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:00.990 line:82%
I have to get a dressed picked up.

1839
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:02.660 line:82%
I'm sending you an address.
Pick up a dress.

1840
01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:04.660 line:82%
If he is going to Sarojini
then CP is right next to it.

1841
01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:06.160 line:82%
Hop skip and jump.

1842
01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:07.160 line:82%
Tell me, what do you want?

1843
01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.370 line:82%
I feel like having Wenger's pastry.

1844
01:47:08.490 --> 01:47:09.370 line:82%
It's the best.

1845
01:47:09.490 --> 01:47:11.370 line:82%
Write down what everyone
wants and give me.

1846
01:47:11.370 --> 01:47:12.700 line:82%
Sweety, do you want anything?

1847
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:13.700 line:82%
Titu and Pihu are close to home.

1848
01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:15.200 line:82%
Titu and Pihu can get it.

1849
01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:18.200 line:82%
Titu knows what I like from there.

1850
01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:20.700 line:82%
Aunt's mobile phone was
given for repair in Karol Bagh.

1851
01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:21.740 line:82%
Ask them to get that as well

1852
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:25.410 line:82%
Titu, aunt's mobile phone
is given for repair in Karol Bagh.

1853
01:47:25.450 --> 01:47:26.240 line:82%
Get that as well.

1854
01:47:26.290 --> 01:47:29.790 line:82%
And wait, let me ask dad as well.

1855
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:41.830 line:82%
Sweety...

1856
01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:43.540 line:82%
Strolling in the garden?

1857
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:44.700 line:82%
So late in the night?

1858
01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:46.330 line:82%
That too all by yourself?

1859
01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:49.410 line:82%
Has Titu still not returned?

1860
01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:54.410 line:82%
Oh.

1861
01:47:58.450 --> 01:48:01.580 line:82%
HeenaGulati91 says,
"Best couple ever."

1862
01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:04.120 line:82%
I totally agree with Heena.

1863
01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.790 line:82%
Do you have any kohl?

1864
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:09.450 line:82%
There are just 48 hours left.

1865
01:48:10.330 --> 01:48:13.830 line:82%
Try convincing as many people
as you can to agree with Heena.

1866
01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.870 line:82%
I just need to convince one.

1867
01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.660 line:82%
Where have you been, Titu?

1868
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:20.410 line:82%
Sweety has been waiting for you

1869
01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:21.910 line:82%
She didn't even eat.

1870
01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:23.410 line:82%
Go have dinner with her first.

1871
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:26.080 line:82%
One more bite and he'll burst.

1872
01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:27.540 line:82%
She eats more than me.

1873
01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:28.790 line:82%
She even ate from the parcel.

1874
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:31.620 line:82%
I hope she didn't eat my pastry.

1875
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:32.790 line:82%
Your pastry?

1876
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:34.620 line:82%
Sorry, it wasn't
mentioned in the message.

1877
01:48:48.370 --> 01:48:50.870 line:82%
Can you carry my bags to my bedroom?

1878
01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.200 line:82%
Yes, let's go to sleep.

1879
01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.370 line:82%
We have to get up
early morning tomorrow.

1880
01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:07.790 line:82%
"These troublesome bangles
won't stop clinking today."

1881
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:09.950 line:82%
"My wrist will stay out of reach."

1882
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:11.950 line:82%
"You won't be able to hold them."

1883
01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.990 line:82%
"These troublesome bangles
won't stop clinking today."

1884
01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.160 line:82%
"My wrist will stay out of reach."

1885
01:49:18.330 --> 01:49:20.330 line:82%
"You won't be able to hold them."

1886
01:49:24.370 --> 01:49:26.370 line:82%
"You have your attention
focused at me."

1887
01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:29.040 line:82%
"I look ravishing today."

1888
01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:37.240 line:82%
"You insist on dancing only with me."

1889
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:42.950 line:82%
"You have your attention
focused at me."

1890
01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:45.120 line:82%
"I look ravishing today."

1891
01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:49.330 line:82%
"You insist on dancing only with me."

1892
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:51.330 line:82%
"Hey drunkard..."

1893
01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:53.370 line:82%
"We are inviting trouble today."

1894
01:49:53.490 --> 01:49:58.200 line:82%
"We swing a little to the
beats of the drum with the group."

1895
01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.080 line:82%
"My moves are a hit, beloved..."

1896
01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.200 line:82%
"My moves are a hit, beloved..."

1897
01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:06.200 line:82%

the beats of your drums."

01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:29.200 line:82%
"I am called a beauty queen here."

1904
01:50:29.370 --> 01:50:33.040 line:82%
"I am up-to-date with
the latest fashion."

1905
01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.040 line:82%
"My dresses are imported."

1906
01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.370 line:82%
"I am here to steal hearts."

1907
01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:43.450 line:82%
"Whenever you praise me,
I feel a little shy, beloved..."

1908
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:45.620 line:82%
"My moves..."

1909

"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1921
01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:20.740 line:82%
Why did you break up with me?

1922
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:32.120 line:82%
My being in Amsterdam
was no coincidence.

1923
01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.450 line:82%
Sonu called me there.

1924
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:39.330 line:82%
He said...

1925
01:53:39.450 --> 01:53:42.330 line:82%
"Titu was depressed for
months after breaking up with you.

1926
01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.330 line:82%
Then he agreed for
an arranged marriage.

1927
01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:46.990 line:82%
He still loves you.

1928
01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.660 line:82%
You and Titu make a perfect couple.

1929
01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:55.540 line:82%
I promise to get Titu back to you.

1930
01:53:56.370 --> 01:53:58.540 line:82%
You just follow me.

1931
01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.290 line:82%
And I, like a fool, just to
see my name on the wedding card...

1932
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:07.120 line:82%
...kept agreeing
to everything he said.

1933
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:10.790 line:82%
He said "Sweety is the wrong girl,"
and I believed him.

1934
01:54:11.290 --> 01:54:13.990 line:82%
He said "Titu is unhappy with her,"
and I believed him.

1935
01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:18.870 line:82%
He said "Titu still loves you,"
and I believed him.

1936
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:24.370 line:82%
I am such a fool.

1937
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:26.200 line:82%
The same person who
took you away from me...

1938
01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:29.540 line:82%
...promised to help me get you back,
and I believed him.

1939
01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:36.240 line:82%
I am stupid, I am selfish too.

1940
01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:41.450 line:82%
But I am not a wretch.

1941
01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:00.870 line:82%
Titu, I know what this looks like,
but I had no other option.

1942
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:03.410 line:82%
You don't know her.
She is playing a game.

1943
01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:06.410 line:82%
She accepted that herself,
on the day of your engagement...

1944
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:10.910 line:82%
And what do you think, whatever...

1945
01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:23.330 line:82%
I am getting married tomorrow.

1946
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:24.450 line:82%
You're invited for drinks.

1947
01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:26.790 line:82%
"If you stay upset
then who would smile?"

1948
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:32.330 line:82%
"If you go
then who would stay back?"

1949
01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:37.660 line:82%
"When you stay quiet,
I feel scared..."

1950
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:43.700 line:82%
"Who would claim me as his own, now?"

1951
01:56:55.950 --> 01:57:00.620 line:82%
"If you stay upset
then who would smile?"

1952
01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:06.330 line:82%
"If you go
then who would stay back?"

1953
01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:11.540 line:82%
"When you stay quiet,
I feel scared..."

1954
01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:18.240 line:82%
"Who would claim me as his own, now?"

1955
01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:21.580 line:82%
"You are the reason..."

1956
01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:30.240 line:82%
"Without you,
I am useless, without a cause."

1957
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:33.160 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

1958
01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:39.990 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

1959
01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:42.160 line:82%
I feel so strange.

1960
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:45.490 line:82%
I know I'm getting married...

1961
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:47.870 line:82%
But today...

1962
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:51.700 line:82%
You know to think that
it's happening today...

1963
01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:55.540 line:82%
I've just been smiling
since the time I woke up.

1964
01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.240 line:82%
You are happy, aren't you?

1965
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:01.580 line:82%
I am getting married today.

1966
01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:03.580 line:82%
I just want everyone to be happy.

1967
01:59:07.290 --> 01:59:09.290 line:82%
I was wondering what
to do with your room.

1968
01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:12.330 line:82%
I mean I knew you'd be kicked out...

1969
01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:15.830 line:82%
...just didn't know
it would happen so soon.

1970
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:22.200 line:82%
We were in school...

1971
01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:26.370 line:82%
There was a boy who
used to trouble Titu a lot.

1972
01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:29.740 line:82%
Every day he'd sit behind
Titu and poke him with a pencil.

1973
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:31.740 line:82%
Titu would cry a lot.

1974
01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:34.700 line:82%
One day I sat behind that boy.

1975
01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:39.120 line:82%
And as he was about to sit,
I put a compass below him.

1976
01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:40.910 line:82%
That boy cried a lot.

1977
01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:42.450 line:82%
Complained to the teacher.

1978
01:59:42.450 --> 01:59:43.790 line:82%
I was severely beaten up.

1979
01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:48.620 line:82%
But after that day,
no one in school troubled Titu.

1980
01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:53.540 line:82%
Titu tells you everything, right?

1981
01:59:54.330 --> 01:59:55.490 line:82%
You know everything?

1982
01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:00.160 line:82%
You know everything Titu tells you.

1983
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:03.410 line:82%
I know everything that
Titu doesn't even tell himself.

1984
02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:08.080 line:82%
You haven't spent
as many months with him...

1985
02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:09.910 line:82%
...as I've spent years.

1986
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:12.910 line:82%
I've always kept him
safe from people like you.

1987
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:18.120 line:82%
My Titu is naïve...

1988
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:20.450 line:82%
...gets influenced quite easily.

1989
02:00:21.450 --> 02:00:23.160 line:82%
Then doesn't understand
any reasoning.

1990
02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:26.160 line:82%
That's why I have
to resort to such methods.

1991
02:00:28.830 --> 02:00:29.870 line:82%
It is actually my fault.

1992
02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:32.160 line:82%
I started trying to defeat you.

1993
02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:37.700 line:82%
I forgot that it was never about
defeating you, it was about saving Titu.

1994
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:45.620 line:82%
And if it's about saving Titu,
then come what may...

1995
02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.290 line:82%
You will not get married tonight.

1996
02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:53.830 line:82%
I swear on my life.

1997
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:02.370 line:82%
You can try.

1998
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:06.160 line:82%
But let me warn you.

1999
02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:08.700 line:82%
Between a friend and a girl...

2000
02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:10.080 line:82%
...the girl always wins.

2001
02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:36.040 line:82%
What's your plan now?

2002
02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:39.870 line:82%
No more plans, Ghasitey.

2003
02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:44.910 line:82%
Wait, let me sort this nonsense.

2004
02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.080 line:82%
No, Ghasitey.

2005
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:51.950 line:82%
If you have to sort,
then there's nothing left to sort.

2006
02:01:54.450 --> 02:01:55.620 line:82%
She warned me...

2007
02:01:57.450 --> 02:01:58.620 line:82%
That between a friend and a girl...

2008
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:59.950 line:82%
...the girl always wins.

2009
02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:03.290 line:82%
So now either the
friend will make me win...

2010
02:02:04.330 --> 02:02:05.290 line:82%
Or else...

2011
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:11.040 line:82%
Like others, even Sonu and Titu
will meet once in three months...

2012
02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:15.700 line:82%
Call each other on birthdays...

2013
02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:21.410 line:82%
Get drunk and tell tales
of their friendship...

2014
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:32.620 line:82%
"It's my best friend's wedding today."

2015
02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:35.330 line:82%
"It's my best friend's wedding today."

2016
02:02:36.330 --> 02:02:38.160 line:82%
"It's my best friend's wedding..."

2017
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:48.540 line:82%
"Come, let's fight over toys again."

2018
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:54.870 line:82%
"You can win, I will lose."

2019
02:02:55.620 --> 02:03:00.580 line:82%
"Come, let's be mischievous again."

2020
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:06.290 line:82%
"You can run away,
I will stay to get beaten up."

2021
02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:12.830 line:82%
"Even your abuses sound sweet."

2022
02:03:13.330 --> 02:03:19.200 line:82%
"I am all ears for them."

2023
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:22.700 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

2024
02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:28.910 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

2025
02:03:31.290 --> 02:03:34.450 line:82%
"I am your best friend..."

2026
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:47.040 line:82%
"It is the time to celebrate."

2027
02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:50.040 line:82%
"It is an auspicious occasion..."

2028
02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:52.870 line:82%
"Music will play,
buddies will dance..."

2029
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:55.700 line:82%
"It's time to congratulate."

2030
02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:01.240 line:82%
"I am dancing with joy."

2031
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:06.790 line:82%
"I keep my tears at bay."

2032
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:17.330 line:82%
"Old relations don't fade away..."

2033
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:24.160 line:82%
"When new relations are formed."

2034
02:04:24.370 --> 02:04:29.040 line:82%
"If I am leaving, then let me go."

2035
02:04:29.410 --> 02:04:34.700 line:82%
"Why are you upset that I am leaving?"

2036
02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:37.910 line:82%
"Why fix what's broken?"

2037
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:40.620 line:82%
"Why did you turn towards me?"

2038
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:43.290 line:82%
"You have no right to say..."

2039
02:04:43.290 --> 02:04:46.830 line:82%
"That we are no longer friends."

2040
02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:52.490 line:82%
"It's only of your friendship..."

2041
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:59.370 line:82%
"That I have a right over, forever."

2042
02:04:59.370 --> 02:05:02.740 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

2043
02:05:22.330 --> 02:05:25.660 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

2044
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:32.540 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

2045
02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:37.410 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

2046
02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:42.910 line:82%
"I am your best friend."

2047
02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:06.330 line:82%
To heck with her truth
and to heck with my lies.

2048
02:06:14.410 --> 02:06:16.240 line:82%
It's as simple as this, Titu.

2049
02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:21.290 line:82%
It's either her, or me.

2050
02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:45.200 line:82%
You have two options.

2051
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:49.080 line:82%
Either believe that
I am telling the truth...

2052
02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:52.580 line:82%
And then keep thinking all
your life that maybe he was right.

2053
02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:56.080 line:82%
Or believe that he
is telling the truth...

2054
02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.410 line:82%
And then keep thinking
all your life that I was right.

2055
02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:10.950 line:82%
We were 13 when aunty passed away.

2056
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:17.660 line:82%
I didn't move from Sonu's side
for three days, as he hadn't cried...

2057
02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:23.370 line:82%
I couldn't not be with him when he did.

2058
02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:29.410 line:82%
The fourth day he cried, in my arms.

2059
02:08:30.410 --> 02:08:31.450 line:82%
Kept on crying...

2060
02:08:31.450 --> 02:08:32.950 line:82%
For three hours straight.

2061
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:37.450 line:82%
I locked the door so
no one else could come in.

2062
02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:43.330 line:82%
Then he cried himself to sleep.

2063
02:08:48.370 --> 02:08:53.700 line:82%
Since that day, I've never
seen a tear in his eyes, come what may.

2064
02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:00.700 line:82%
You may be honest, and he may be lying.

2065
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:10.490 line:82%
But if it is between you and him...

2066
02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:31.540 line:82%
I'll break your teeth.

2067
02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:39.700 line:82%
We'll die single this way.

2068
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:40.910 line:82%
What do you mean by "we"?

2069
02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:42.580 line:82%
Why would I die single?

2070
02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:45.290 line:82%
It's not me who always.
falls for the wrong girl

2071
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:47.450 line:82%
When did you realize
that she is wrong?

2072
02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:49.950 line:82%
She told me on the
day of your engagement.

2073
02:10:49.950 --> 02:10:51.290 line:82%
Then you should have
told me that day itself.

2074
02:10:51.450 --> 02:10:52.620 line:82%
Would've saved us a
few lakhs and some respect.

2075
02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:56.290 line:82%
After twelve years,
I had made sweets with my own hands.

2076
02:10:57.450 --> 02:10:59.330 line:82%
I almost booked a Jaguar.

2077
02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:01.990 line:82%
You don't say a word, Ghasitey.

2078
02:11:02.330 --> 02:11:03.370 line:82%
I fought all by myself.

2079
02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:04.870 line:82%
You were enjoying this.

2080
02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:08.700 line:82%
This is my principle of life.

2081
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:12.910 line:82%
Never tell an idiot that he's an idiot.

2082
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:22.950 line:82%
What's happening out there?

2083
02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:27.490 line:82%
Lalu had given me two new
notes of 500.

2084
02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:30.330 line:82%
I had fixed it for 22nd December
and he got it changed to 22nd October.

2085
02:11:30.450 --> 02:11:33.160 line:82%
If you marry them on the wrong date
then it's bound to happen.

2086
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:34.830 line:82%
Here's the catering bill.

2087
02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:36.490 line:82%
The light bill.

2088
02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:38.160 line:82%
Decoration bill.

2089
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:40.200 line:82%
And this is the location bill.

2090
02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:41.580 line:82%
And here's another
rough estimated bill.

2091
02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:44.040 line:82%
Okay, but wasn't
splitting a part of the deal?

2092
02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:45.410 line:82%
Well so was a marriage.

2093
02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:46.410 line:82%
Where's the groom?

2094
02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:48.080 line:82%
You are being disgustingly rude.

2095
02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:48.740 line:82%
I am being rude?

2096
02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:50.450 line:82%
I am disgusting?

2097
02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:52.080 line:82%
You disgusting, your father disgusting.

2098
02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:53.120 line:82%
Your entire family is disgusting.

2099
02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:54.080 line:82%
Even your sweets are disgusting!

2100
02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:55.740 line:82%
Don't say a word against my sweets!

2101
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:57.330 line:82%
But please, try to understand.

2102
02:11:57.450 --> 02:11:58.830 line:82%
- I...
- Don't try to make me understand.

2103
02:11:58.830 --> 02:12:00.330 line:82%
Make your characterless
son understand!

2104
02:12:00.330 --> 02:12:02.330 line:82%
Hey! How dare you
call my son characterless?

2105
02:12:02.330 --> 02:12:04.120 line:82%
You characterless,
your daughter characterless!

2106
02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:06.330 line:82%
I can see who is characterless!
Look at the way you talk.

2107
02:12:06.370 --> 02:12:08.200 line:82%
Give the necklace back!

2108
02:12:08.490 --> 02:12:09.990 line:82%
Did you leave alone or
did everyone leave with you?

2109
02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:12.330 line:82%
I don't know who left behind me.

2110
02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:14.200 line:82%
How could I turn back to see?

2111
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:16.040 line:82%
Would've ruined the impact.

2112
02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:22.580 line:82%
I swear on God,
God has stopped making good girls.

2113
02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:24.910 line:82%
Don't worry. I am there for you.

2114
02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:26.450 line:82%
What do you mean?

2115
02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:28.950 line:82%
Think I'm crazy to
ruin my life with you?

2116
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:32.290 line:82%
I think I've had
enough of this nonsense.

2117
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:33.660 line:82%
I am 28.

2118
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:36.490 line:82%
I should find a nice girl
and settle down before I turn 30.

2119
02:12:37.290 --> 02:12:41.200 line:82%
Sonu, my darling,
I know that you too have some needs.

2120
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:44.200 line:82%
I am not getting married for sex.

2121
02:12:44.370 --> 02:12:45.370 line:82%
Why're you thinking
of marrying at all?

2122
02:12:45.370 --> 02:12:46.540 line:82%
He's an idiot.

2123
02:12:56.410 --> 02:12:58.120 line:82%
Idiot, at least tell me that...

2124
02:12:58.950 --> 02:13:00.450 line:82%
I like sofas.

2125
02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:03.080 line:82%
I am telling you Ghasita...

2126
02:13:04.290 --> 02:13:05.620 line:82%
What a...

2127
02:13:06.490 --> 02:13:08.330 line:82%
Not at all, aunty... ah mummy.

2128
02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:10.490 line:82%
Send all the bed sheets
to the laundry.

2129
02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:13.160 line:82%
Call the plumber in the afternoon
and get the inside bathroom...

2130
02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:18.200 line:82%
I am telling... you are protective...

2131
02:13:18.330 --> 02:13:19.200 line:82%
One second, sir. One second.

2132
02:13:19.330 --> 02:13:20.580 line:82%
Sir, dropped the kurta.

2133
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:22.370 line:82%
One second, sir.
The mic has fallen again.

2134
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:23.740 line:82%
Malkit Singh is...

2135
02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:26.200 line:82%
Damn it...

2136
02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:28.740 line:82%
Your mother-in-law's health...
is not good.

2137
02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:29.240 line:82%
I am sorry.

2138
02:13:29.290 --> 02:13:31.080 line:82%
- Just dance, grandma?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2139
02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:31.950 line:82%
One more.

2140
02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.910 line:82%
Tell me something... come again.

2141
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:38.450 line:82%
"Get me..."

2142
02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:39.490 line:82%

"When I get tipsy,
I tend to get risky."

2149
02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:56.740 line:82%
"Serve me the drink I'm crazy about,
get me tipsy."

2150

"Your scene is beyond
any reasoning of mine."

2164

"I know that you'll
get a hangover, baby."

2165
02:14:33.410 --> 02:14:35.580 line:82%
"That's why I carry
lemons in pockets already."

"In a single shot, I wooed you."

2167
02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:40.240 line:82%
"I took the risk of chasing you."

2168

"What's the use of
living a sober life?"

2173
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:54.160 line:82%
"One should learn
how to drink from you."
