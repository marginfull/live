-Gurukul?
-Yeah.

2
00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:39.225 line:82%
My name is Karan. Karan Choudhary.

3
00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:42.561 line:82%
Sameer. Sameer Sharma.

4
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.203 line:82%
Let's go.

5
00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:32.693 line:82%
Hey, gus. Gurukul?

6
00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:33.853 line:82%
-Yeah.
-Cool.

7
00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.838 line:82%
-Vicky.
-Sameer.

8
00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.488 line:82%
Okay.

9
00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:42.246 line:82%
This was the first meeting
for these three.

10
00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.039 line:82%
They did not know then,

11
00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:48.002 line:82%
that this little rendezvous was to pave
the path for a lifelong friendship.

12
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:37.468 line:82%
GURUKUL

13
00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:48.562 line:82%
Quite a big room.

14
00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:53.797 line:82%
Excuse me.

15
00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:57.988 line:82%
This bed is mine.

16
00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.792 line:82%
Is this a bed or a rock?

17
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.080 line:82%
Now that we are in Gurukul,
We have to study.

18
00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:09.029 line:82%
Even if the bed is as hard as rock,
we still have to sleep.

19
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.541 line:82%
Hey, guys. Cool, right? My poem?

20
00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:15.589 line:82%
No one is listening. No reaction.

21
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:21.220 line:82%
Hey guys, if any of you snore at night,
just let me know,

22
00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:23.221 line:82%
so I can rustle up
some cotton for my ears.

23
00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.188 line:82%
The thing is, I really need
my eight hours of sleep,

24
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:29.353 line:82%
dreaming of pretty girls.
So let me know, thanks.

25
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.024 line:82%
What's that?

26
00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:36.312 line:82%
Who's voice is that?

27
00:04:44.827 --> 00:04:47.235 line:82%
Who is that?

28
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.545 line:82%
That is the principal of Gurukul.
The one and only, Mr. Narayan Shankar.

29
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:48.891 line:82%
No, thanks.

30
00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:01.653 line:82%
GURUKUL

31
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.711 line:82%
Tradition,

32
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.967 line:82%
honor

33
00:06:22.608 --> 00:06:23.634 line:82%
and discipline.

34
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.680 line:82%
These are the three pillars of Gurukul.

35
00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:35.854 line:82%
These are the values with which
we shape your future.

36
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:41.860 line:82%
Those who have gone before you
have set very high standards for you.

37
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.496 line:82%
Today, all of them are successful men
in their own respective fields.

38
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:51.620 line:82%
Some are great writers, great businessmen
and some great politicians.

39
00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:58.115 line:82%
But all of them have one thing in common.
All their lives,

40
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.547 line:82%
they have followed the principles
taught to them by this Gurukul.

41
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:09.012 line:82%
Today, you have the opportunity
to be a part of this great lineage.

42
00:07:12.384 --> 00:07:15.602 line:82%
You have been summoned
from all over the country

43
00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:20.607 line:82%
because we believe that you
have what it takes to be great men.

44
00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:25.112 line:82%
But success never comes so easily.

45
00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:29.867 line:82%
Behind every great success
lies a great sacrifice.

46
00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.664 line:82%
By entering this institution today,

47
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.966 line:82%
you have left behind the world outside.

48
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:42.045 line:82%
As long as you are here,
Gurukul is your world.

49
00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:47.968 line:82%
We expect that you will study
with complete dedication

50
00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.470 line:82%
and follow the rules and regulations

51
00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:52.723 line:82%
of this institution
with strict discipline.

52
00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:56.852 line:82%
If any one is found guilty of misconduct,

53
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.250 line:82%
he will be expelled immediately.

54
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:06.361 line:82%
And remember,
if you are expelled from here,

55
00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:11.825 line:82%
then the doors to every other institute in
this country will be shut for you as well.

56
00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:19.518 line:82%
So if there is anyone here who
is not willing to make this sacrifice,

57
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.297 line:82%
then he is free to walk
out of that gate right now.

58
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:29.176 line:82%
But if you have decided to stay here,

59
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:34.181 line:82%
then that gate and the world outside
does not exist for you anymore.

60
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:47.194 line:82%
Now I want all of you to close
your eyes, bow your heads,

61
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.609 line:82%
and think of every word I have said to you

62
00:08:52.658 --> 00:08:54.409 line:82%
and to come to your respective decisions.

63
00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:36.345 line:82%
MOHABBATEIN

64
00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:35.547 line:82%
Cool.

65
00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:38.647 line:82%
-Vicky. That's my photograph.
-I can see that, man,

66
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.219 line:82%
-but who's this lady in red with you?
-Nobody, give it back.

67
00:12:41.303 --> 00:12:42.387 line:82%
Sameer has a girlfriend.

68
00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:44.639 line:82%
Stop it, Vicky. What are you doing?

69
00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:46.016 line:82%
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, shit.

70
00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:52.594 line:82%
Oh, God! It's you. You scared us.

71
00:12:52.668 --> 00:12:55.435 line:82%
Come here, quickly.
I've got something to show you.

72
00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:57.595 line:82%
-Okay, tell me.
-Vicky.

73
00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.446 line:82%
-Who is this?
-This?

74
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.659 line:82%
Romeo and Juliet. Heer, Ranjha.
Soni, Mahiwal.

75
00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.798 line:82%
Sameer and... Sameer and?

76
00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:08.060 line:82%
Sanjana. And it's not
what you're making it out to be.

77
00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:12.784 line:82%
She's just a good friend of mine,
actually, she was a friend.

78
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:15.504 line:82%
She was a friend?

79
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:19.633 line:82%
Sanju was my childhood friend.
We were best friends.

80
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.389 line:82%
We were neighbors
and literally grew up together.

81
00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:29.216 line:82%
We had this photograph taken
at a funfair. It was her birthday.

82
00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:33.355 line:82%
And the next day,
she was supposed to leave. Forever.

83
00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:38.693 line:82%
Her father had been transferred
and that was the last time that I saw her.

84
00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:45.507 line:82%
That was six years ago.
I was just 14 years old.

85
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.328 line:82%
But do you know where she is now?

86
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:51.498 line:82%
I heard a few months ago
that she could be in this very town.

87
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.397 line:82%
That's great! Which means
that you know where she lives?

88
00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:56.807 line:82%
No, I don't. And I don't want to find out.

89
00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.261 line:82%
-Why not?
-Because it's been a long time

90
00:14:00.522 --> 00:14:03.085 line:82%
and I don't know if she will recognize me

91
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.286 line:82%
or whether she would like to meet me
or not. So if we are fated to meet,

92
00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:12.477 line:82%
then we will happen across each other's
paths. And if we don't, then so be it.

93
00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:16.314 line:82%
Hey, Sameer. You really love this girl.

94
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:20.026 line:82%
No, nothing of the sort.
She's just an old friend.

95
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.861 line:82%
Shut up. Just an old friend.

96
00:14:22.075 --> 00:14:25.031 line:82%
Tell me something. How many other
old friends' photos

97
00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:27.247 line:82%
have you been carrying
for the last six years?

98
00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.536 line:82%
That's the bell for your love.

99
00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.037 line:82%
Come on, it's time to sleep.

100
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:32.497 line:82%
Old friend, my foot.

101
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:34.416 line:82%
I wish I had that photograph in my pocket.

102
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:38.712 line:82%
By now I'd have been in her house,
making her feed me jalebi.

103
00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.760 line:82%
And look at you! "We'll meet if we're
destined to, otherwise, we won't."

104
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:44.940 line:82%
Nonsense, man.

105
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.682 line:82%
Know what, Karan.
There's a girls' college behind ours?

106
00:14:51.165 --> 00:14:53.268 line:82%
-So what should I do?
-No. You don't do anything.

107
00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:56.094 line:82%
You just think. I'll be the one doing it.

108
00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:01.026 line:82%
I'm late. Why do we've to begin so early?

109
00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.147 line:82%
Shit, come on, Vicky. Let's go.

110
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.834 line:82%
Who's that? Stop there!

111
00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:20.962 line:82%
Stop it! You thief.

112
00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.590 line:82%
Where are you running off to?

113
00:15:23.675 --> 00:15:25.467 line:82%
I'll kill you.

114
00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:49.324 line:82%
Ishika! Miss Monica is coming! Hurry up!

115
00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:06.800 line:82%
Ishika. Love.

116
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:23.483 line:82%
We're through at last. Can we go now?
I'm terribly hungry.

117
00:16:23.578 --> 00:16:27.529 line:82%
-We've still got to buy mineral water.
-It was available in the shop back there.

118
00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:29.521 line:82%
You guys take the stuff to the jeep.

119
00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:30.990 line:82%
-I'll go and get it.
-Okay.

120
00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.957 line:82%
You're always thinking about food.
You know nothing else, do you?

121
00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.416 line:82%
-How much is it for?
-One and a half rupees.

122
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.723 line:82%
How is it one and a half?
It's price is two and a half.

123
00:16:41.796 --> 00:16:43.196 line:82%
No, ma'am, it's for one and a half.

124
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.880 line:82%
Look, I know everything.
The price is two and a half rupees

125
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.342 line:82%
and I will pay you accordingly,
not a penny more, not a penny less.

126
00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:52.345 line:82%
-Please try to understand what I say.
-I will listen to nothing.

127
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.414 line:82%
Do you want to give it or not?
Tell me clearly.

128
00:16:54.487 --> 00:16:57.027 line:82%
But ma'am, it costs one and a half rupees,
not two and a half!

129
00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:01.438 line:82%
Only last week my friend bought
the same thing from your shop

130
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.106 line:82%
-for two and a half bucks.
-Maybe...

131
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:06.443 line:82%
-but the price now is one and a half.
-But I'll pay two and a half rupees.

132
00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.015 line:82%
-Quickly, pack it.
-Somebody, please make her see reason.

133
00:17:09.098 --> 00:17:10.864 line:82%
Please hold this. Thank you.

134
00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:15.452 line:82%
We'll meet, if we are destined to.

135
00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.621 line:82%
-Are you giving it or not?
-How can I charge

136
00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:20.081 line:82%
two and a half for one and a half?

137
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:23.491 line:82%
I don't know. I'll pay two and a half.
Here's the money, if you want it.

138
00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:27.050 line:82%
By the way, one and a half rupees
is less than two and a half rupees.

139
00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.642 line:82%
Is it really?

140
00:17:30.756 --> 00:17:32.519 line:82%
That's just what I was trying to explain.

141
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.763 line:82%
How much is one and a half?

142
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:36.378 line:82%
One and a half rupees.

143
00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.810 line:82%
Okay, so give it to me
for one and a half rupees.

144
00:17:40.897 --> 00:17:42.057 line:82%
As you wish.

145
00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.399 line:82%
-Your bangles and change.
-Thank you.

146
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.077 line:82%
Thanks.

147
00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:54.866 line:82%
Show me these bangles, please.

148
00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.037 line:82%
-For you?
-Yes.

149
00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:58.244 line:82%
-What?
-No, for a friend of mine.

150
00:17:58.309 --> 00:17:59.370 line:82%
Which one's?

151
00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:02.457 line:82%
-That red one, yes, the green one.
-That one?

152
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.169 line:82%
Sameer. Sameer Sharma!

153
00:18:09.011 --> 00:18:10.012 line:82%
Sanju.

154
00:18:10.947 --> 00:18:13.738 line:82%
It's you! I don't believe this, Sameer.

155
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.388 line:82%
-What are you doing here?
-Me? I am a student at Gurukul.

156
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:19.682 line:82%
-Not bad, Mr. Sharma.
-Cool, huh?

157
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:23.520 line:82%
Which means you've been here for so long,

158
00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:27.315 line:82%
-and did not even bother to call me.
-I didn't have your...

159
00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:29.092 line:82%
Stop making excuses!

160
00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.945 line:82%
The truth is that
you didn't even think of me,

161
00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:35.532 line:82%
so it did not bother you
whether I was in this town or not,

162
00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:37.905 line:82%
what is my phone number. Right? Stupid!

163
00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:40.094 line:82%
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Hey, that's mine. Thank you.

164
00:18:40.338 --> 00:18:41.690 line:82%
-What is it?
- Nothing,

165
00:18:41.764 --> 00:18:43.623 line:82%
just the list of things I had to buy.

166
00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:49.441 line:82%
-Have you found everything?
-Yes. I've found everything.

167
00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:52.512 line:82%
So come with me.
I'm going to set you straight.

168
00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:55.106 line:82%
Who do you think you are?
Being a Gurukul student,

169
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.978 line:82%
it has gotten to your head.
We're going home straight away.

170
00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:01.463 line:82%
-Papa will be so happy to see you.
-Sanju, I cannot come now...

171
00:19:01.554 --> 00:19:04.117 line:82%
-I've to return to Gurukul.
-Promise you'll come on Sunday.

172
00:19:04.198 --> 00:19:06.456 line:82%
I promise.

173
00:19:18.471 --> 00:19:22.848 line:82%
Khan Baba, when does the train
from Aligarh usually arrive?

174
00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:29.144 line:82%
The train should be here any moment.
Whom have you come to receive?

175
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.838 line:82%
-The professor of my college.
-I see...

176
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.465 line:82%
The train should be here any moment.

177
00:19:48.102 --> 00:19:51.396 line:82%
Khan Baba, who's that girl?

178
00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:57.488 line:82%
That's Kiran. She comes here quite often.

179
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:01.761 line:82%
Kiran.

180
00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:36.819 line:82%
-Hey. Gurukul. Are you from Gurukul?
-Yes, sir.

181
00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:39.072 line:82%
-Sir, your luggage?
-No, it's okay.

182
00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.324 line:82%
Take this.

183
00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:52.877 line:82%
-Shall we leave?
-Yes, sir.

184
00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:13.071 line:82%
Okay, guys, this is it. I have decided.
First thing tomorrow morning,

185
00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.922 line:82%
I'm going to cross that gate,
enter that girls' hostel

186
00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:18.773 line:82%
and wherever that girl is,
I am going to find her

187
00:21:19.362 --> 00:21:24.125 line:82%
and look deep into her eyes
and tell her, "You're beautiful."

188
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:26.764 line:82%
I am going to do it, guys!

189
00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.860 line:82%
Now you guys tell me
what you have decided.

190
00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.582 line:82%
What say, Sameer?

191
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.867 line:82%
Is she going to be
just a friend all your life?

192
00:21:36.656 --> 00:21:37.706 line:82%
No...

193
00:21:39.357 --> 00:21:41.426 line:82%
for too many years,
I've just been a friend of her

194
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:46.305 line:82%
-But now it's time to take it further.
-That's the spirit, my boy.

195
00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.224 line:82%
Hey, Karan. What have you thought?

196
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:51.394 line:82%
I am going to think of her
as a beautiful dream

197
00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:55.023 line:82%
-and forget about her.
-What? Don't be such a sissy.

198
00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:59.819 line:82%
You guys must've forgotten,
but I still remember every word

199
00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:03.364 line:82%
Narayan Shankar uttered.
If you break the rules of Gurukul,

200
00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:04.949 line:82%
you will be expelled.

201
00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:07.555 line:82%
Come on, Karan. Don't be so scared.

202
00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:10.204 line:82%
People usually go overboard
during a speech,

203
00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:12.582 line:82%
that doesn't mean it is set in stone.

204
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.418 line:82%
Every word Narayan Shankar says
is set in stone.

205
00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:19.172 line:82%
He has done it earlier,
and he can do it again.

206
00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:20.673 line:82%
What has he done earlier?

207
00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:23.687 line:82%
It's a famous story.

208
00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:26.738 line:82%
There used to be this student here
a few years ago.

209
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:31.945 line:82%
He was brilliant. Everyone thought
he would do something in life.

210
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:34.986 line:82%
But he made one mistake.

211
00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:40.610 line:82%
He broke a rule of Gurukul,
he fell in love.

212
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.710 line:82%
Narayan Shankar expelled him without
even seeing him or meeting him.

213
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:47.517 line:82%
And, as everyone knows,

214
00:22:48.331 --> 00:22:51.559 line:82%
once you're expelled from here,
you cannot get admission elsewhere.

215
00:22:52.747 --> 00:22:54.332 line:82%
Today, no one knows

216
00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:59.754 line:82%
where he is or what has happened to him.
He is just a nameless joke now.

217
00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:07.261 line:82%
As for the girl he loved,
she committed suicide.

218
00:23:09.764 --> 00:23:11.905 line:82%
She was Narayan Shankar's
one and only child.

219
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.859 line:82%
Everyone thought that this incident
would soften Narayan Shankar.

220
00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:26.531 line:82%
Instead, it only made him harder.

221
00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:32.619 line:82%
So I'm neither a sissy nor weak,

222
00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:37.305 line:82%
but I am not strong enough
to fight Mr. Narayan Shankar.

223
00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:40.419 line:82%
I am not that strong.

224
00:23:48.302 --> 00:23:52.755 line:82%
I guess she is destined to be
just a friend of mine.

225
00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:58.668 line:82%
You will have to wait a little, Ishq,

226
00:24:00.398 --> 00:24:03.067 line:82%
till someone comes and saves us
from Narayan Shankar.

227
00:24:08.739 --> 00:24:10.700 line:82%
What do you want? You can't get inside.

228
00:24:10.783 --> 00:24:12.869 line:82%
Go away. Go!

229
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:36.818 line:82%
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

230
00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:41.856 line:82%
-Where have you been?
-I'd gone to buy supplies.

231
00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:44.358 line:82%
I told you before going.
You needed a new bulb.

232
00:24:44.442 --> 00:24:45.912 line:82%
Why do you ask me to work, then?

233
00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:53.784 line:82%
Mr Sriram, I had asked you
for some paperwork. Is it ready?

234
00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:56.871 line:82%
-It's ready, sir. Yes, sir.
-Please leave it on my table. Thank you.

235
00:25:30.154 --> 00:25:31.530 line:82%
What's happening here?

236
00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:43.292 line:82%
Good morning, sir. My name is Raj Aryan.

237
00:25:43.626 --> 00:25:46.212 line:82%
-I have an appointment with you, sir.
-Don't you know

238
00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:48.743 line:82%
that there're students here
who are trying to study?

239
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:52.677 line:82%
Don't you think you mustn't
make noise in a place like this?

240
00:25:53.261 --> 00:25:54.345 line:82%
I'm sorry, sir.

241
00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:56.722 line:82%
It's just that the little girl
saw the violin in my hand,

242
00:25:56.806 --> 00:26:00.338 line:82%
and insisted on hearing it.
I just couldn't break her heart, sir.

243
00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:03.187 line:82%
It is more important
not to break rules here.

244
00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:04.897 line:82%
Follow me.

245
00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:22.081 line:82%
Sorry, sir.

246
00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:34.880 line:82%
So you teach music.

247
00:26:36.281 --> 00:26:37.291 line:82%
Yes, sir.

248
00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:41.228 line:82%
And you want to be given the opportunity
to teach music here?

249
00:26:42.518 --> 00:26:43.581 line:82%
Yes, sir.

250
00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:47.789 line:82%
Being fully aware
of the traditions of the Gurukul?

251
00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:49.105 line:82%
Yes.

252
00:26:49.567 --> 00:26:54.363 line:82%
Knowing for a fact that no form of music
has ever been taught here

253
00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:59.118 line:82%
-nor probably will it ever be?
-Yes, sir.

254
00:27:03.414 --> 00:27:07.235 line:82%
I read here that you have already been
offered jobs in three other universities

255
00:27:07.877 --> 00:27:09.128 line:82%
and yet you have come here,

256
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:14.308 line:82%
all the way to seek a job. Why?

257
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.694 line:82%
I was told that you would not allow me
to teach music here.

258
00:27:22.892 --> 00:27:25.728 line:82%
They said that it was impossible.
That it was difficult.

259
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:33.444 line:82%
But I like challenges. Facing challenges
is something I enjoy.

260
00:27:36.822 --> 00:27:40.211 line:82%
And what makes you think that
you can make me change my mind?

261
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:45.274 line:82%
From what I have heard about you, sir,

262
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.200 line:82%
I think even you like challenges.
Right, sir?

263
00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:02.315 line:82%
How can your music help my students?

264
00:28:03.813 --> 00:28:06.421 line:82%
Students remain buried in their books
the whole day, sir.

265
00:28:07.144 --> 00:28:10.990 line:82%
Music will rejuvenate them and make
their learning process less stressful.

266
00:28:11.065 --> 00:28:14.443 line:82%
Besides, they will end up learning music,
which is a joy in itself.

267
00:28:14.527 --> 00:28:16.320 line:82%
Music is a wonderful thing, sir. It's...

268
00:28:16.404 --> 00:28:19.865 line:82%
What happens if you do not find enough
students, who want to learn music?

269
00:28:19.949 --> 00:28:21.162 line:82%
That's no problem, sir.

270
00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:26.145 line:82%
I'll pack this small bag, and leave.

271
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:28.369 line:82%
I'll be gone.

272
00:28:29.667 --> 00:28:30.751 line:82%
Yeah.

273
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:38.573 line:82%
-I like your self confidence, Mr. Aryan.
-Thank you, sir.

274
00:28:39.677 --> 00:28:41.323 line:82%
I will give you one opportunity.

275
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:47.852 line:82%
If you do find enough students wishing
to learn music in their spare time,

276
00:28:47.935 --> 00:28:50.146 line:82%
-you've got yourself a job.
-No problem.

277
00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:51.389 line:82%
Otherwise, you will leave.

278
00:28:57.653 --> 00:29:00.977 line:82%
-It's a deal, sir. Yeah?
-All the best. Mr Aryan.

279
00:29:08.456 --> 00:29:09.457 line:82%
Thank you, sir.

280
00:29:15.713 --> 00:29:18.096 line:82%
-Sir, where do I keep this?
-Bring it. Set it here.

281
00:29:18.191 --> 00:29:20.414 line:82%
Yes, keep it here, please. Thank you.

282
00:29:21.635 --> 00:29:23.965 line:82%
I'll do it. Thank you very much.

283
00:31:17.835 --> 00:31:20.995 line:82%
That's quite a classroom
you've made for yourself, Mr. Aryan.

284
00:31:22.256 --> 00:31:25.551 line:82%
I'm sorry sir. I just thought,
that at the end of the day,

285
00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:29.186 line:82%
the students would feel much
better being outside. That's all.

286
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:33.244 line:82%
You already have ten more students
registered since yesterday.

287
00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:34.555 line:82%
Yes.

288
00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:40.316 line:82%
-That's quite an achievement in one day.
-Thank you, sir. As I said,

289
00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:43.486 line:82%
-Music is such a wonderful thing, sir...
-You have the job, Mr. Aryan.

290
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:48.571 line:82%
This is the contract.
Please read it carefully and sign it.

291
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.827 line:82%
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

292
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:58.527 line:82%
Mr. Aryan, you're about
to become a part of Gurukul.

293
00:31:58.621 --> 00:32:00.753 line:82%
-Yes, sir.
-I would like to explain something.

294
00:32:02.338 --> 00:32:03.376 line:82%
Please, sir.

295
00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:07.301 line:82%
For the last 25 years,

296
00:32:07.384 --> 00:32:10.703 line:82%
I have run this place with tradition,
honor, and discipline.

297
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:15.942 line:82%
Nothing has changed in 25 years.

298
00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:21.732 line:82%
Which is why Gurukul has retained
its pristine glory.

299
00:32:24.068 --> 00:32:26.510 line:82%
Yesterday, you changed
the order of a few chairs.

300
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:29.448 line:82%
Tomorrow, you might change something else.

301
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:34.831 line:82%
I do not like change of any kind,
Mr. Aryan.

302
00:32:36.914 --> 00:32:41.210 line:82%
I just don't like changes.

303
00:32:47.758 --> 00:32:48.796 line:82%
I understand, sir.

304
00:32:51.095 --> 00:32:54.807 line:82%
Good. Welcome to Gurukul, Mr. Aryan.

305
00:32:57.851 --> 00:32:58.881 line:82%
Thank you, sir.

306
00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:42.051 line:82%
Love. The greatest inspiration for music.

307
00:33:46.275 --> 00:33:48.452 line:82%
Love and music are very closely related.

308
00:33:48.569 --> 00:33:50.279 line:82%
Because both originate from the heart,

309
00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:54.408 line:82%
and the destinies of both depend on
whether the heart expresses it or not.

310
00:33:55.534 --> 00:34:00.956 line:82%
If you love somebody,
just go and tell her.

311
00:34:01.874 --> 00:34:04.300 line:82%
Don't worry about whether
she accepts or refuses.

312
00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:08.469 line:82%
Similarly, if you feel like playing
the instrument in front of you,

313
00:34:08.552 --> 00:34:13.510 line:82%
just pick it up and play it,
do not worry about being good or bad.

314
00:34:14.428 --> 00:34:20.392 line:82%
Listen to your heart, and do what it says.

315
00:34:23.604 --> 00:34:28.317 line:82%
Now carefully look at that gate.
It's the gate you look at everyday.

316
00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:34.531 line:82%
It's the gate you guys pass by every day,
but can never cross.

317
00:34:36.325 --> 00:34:37.563 line:82%
Look at that gate carefully.

318
00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:42.247 line:82%
And if you have every truly loved someone,

319
00:34:44.792 --> 00:34:46.710 line:82%
then visualize her

320
00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:49.880 line:82%
waiting for you behind that gate.

321
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:11.985 line:82%
What? Nobody's ever been in love before?

322
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:14.112 line:82%
Come on, guys.

323
00:35:23.247 --> 00:35:26.834 line:82%
Yes, yes. She's calling out to you.

324
00:35:28.308 --> 00:35:30.419 line:82%
She's asking you to come
and break down that gate,

325
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.334 line:82%
so that it never closes again.

326
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:36.593 line:82%
Come on, guys, get up and go.

327
00:35:37.219 --> 00:35:41.390 line:82%
She's not going to wait forever.
Listen to your heart.

328
00:35:41.807 --> 00:35:43.812 line:82%
Come on. Get up and break open that gate.

329
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:49.314 line:82%
Come on. Just listen to your heart.
Get up. And get going.

330
00:35:49.523 --> 00:35:50.607 line:82%
Go.

331
00:36:21.722 --> 00:36:23.926 line:82%
No matter how much hatred
there is in the world,

332
00:36:24.011 --> 00:36:25.801 line:82%
love still survives.

333
00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:27.841 line:82%
Go forth and tell the world,

334
00:36:28.353 --> 00:36:33.400 line:82%
the earth, the sky,
nothing can stop these love stories now.

335
00:37:22.407 --> 00:37:27.162 line:82%
In the midst of a walk
I find myself to have stopped

336
00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:32.334 line:82%
Left to myself
I find myself to be lost

337
00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:37.047 line:82%
Mid-sentence, I find
That I have lapsed into silence

338
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:42.112 line:82%
Is this love?

339
00:37:42.217 --> 00:37:47.307 line:82%
Yes, this is love

340
00:37:47.391 --> 00:37:51.937 line:82%
In the midst of a walk
I find myself to have stopped

341
00:37:52.229 --> 00:37:56.608 line:82%
Left to myself
I find myself to be lost

342
00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.822 line:82%
Mid-sentence, I find
That I have lapsed into silence

343
00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:06.702 line:82%
Is this love?

344
00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:12.249 line:82%
Yes, this is love

345
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:16.188 line:82%
Why do I die to see you?

346
00:39:17.481 --> 00:39:20.650 line:82%
I don't know

347
00:39:27.324 --> 00:39:31.286 line:82%
Why do I die to see you?

348
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:35.832 line:82%
I don't know

349
00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:40.295 line:82%
Why do I do what I do?

350
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.925 line:82%
I don't know

351
00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:52.015 line:82%
I have begun to discreetly make my way

352
00:39:52.099 --> 00:39:56.394 line:82%
Through blind alleys

353
00:39:57.104 --> 00:40:01.608 line:82%
Everything in the world lately

354
00:40:01.715 --> 00:40:06.613 line:82%
Has begun to frighten me

355
00:40:06.696 --> 00:40:10.534 line:82%
Oh, what is the matter with me?

356
00:40:10.867 --> 00:40:15.539 line:82%
Is this love?

357
00:40:15.622 --> 00:40:20.752 line:82%
Yes, this is love

358
00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:25.392 line:82%
In the midst of a walk
I find myself to have stopped

359
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:30.262 line:82%
Left to myself
I find myself to be lost

360
00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:35.308 line:82%
Mid-sentence, I find
That I have lapsed into silence

361
00:40:35.517 --> 00:40:40.063 line:82%
Is this love?

362
00:40:40.397 --> 00:40:45.026 line:82%
Yes, this is love

363
00:41:55.847 --> 00:41:59.684 line:82%
In your speech I find

364
00:42:00.769 --> 00:42:03.897 line:82%
The glimmer of mischievousness

365
00:42:11.279 --> 00:42:15.450 line:82%
In your speech I find

366
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:19.663 line:82%
The glimmer of mischievousness

367
00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:25.377 line:82%
On my lips

368
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.797 line:82%
There lingers something of a grievance

369
00:42:30.465 --> 00:42:37.458 line:82%
I make love to your eyes with mine

370
00:42:40.267 --> 00:42:47.241 line:82%
Embracing you, I go into raptures

371
00:42:50.235 --> 00:42:54.197 line:82%
Oh, what is the matter with me?

372
00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:58.827 line:82%
Is this love?

373
00:42:58.912 --> 00:43:04.040 line:82%
Yes, this is love

374
00:43:04.124 --> 00:43:08.712 line:82%
In the midst of a walk
I find myself to have stopped

375
00:43:08.794 --> 00:43:13.466 line:82%
Left to myself
I find myself to be lost

376
00:43:13.633 --> 00:43:18.263 line:82%
Mid-sentence, I find
That I have lapsed into silence

377
00:43:19.014 --> 00:43:23.601 line:82%
Is this love?

378
00:43:23.685 --> 00:43:28.148 line:82%
Yes, this is love

379
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:15.862 line:82%
Mr. Aryan do you know
what you are asking for?

380
00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:17.861 line:82%
Have you forgotten the rules of Gurukul?

381
00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:21.409 line:82%
Please, sir. Think about it,
he has no other choice.

382
00:44:21.493 --> 00:44:23.370 line:82%
Mr. Aryan, you are asking me to allow

383
00:44:23.453 --> 00:44:26.081 line:82%
a student of Gurukul
to do a part time job.

384
00:44:26.344 --> 00:44:28.251 line:82%
It's impossible.

385
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.667 line:82%
Sir, Sameer's father has passed away.

386
00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:34.047 line:82%
His mother works day and night
to support him.

387
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:37.717 line:82%
Thats why, he thinks by getting a job
he can share his mother's burden.

388
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:41.054 line:82%
And I think, we should help him out.
Sorry.

389
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.890 line:82%
May I? Please?

390
00:44:48.176 --> 00:44:49.342 line:82%
Please. Sir--

391
00:44:49.433 --> 00:44:50.688 line:82%
Good morning, sir.

392
00:44:51.231 --> 00:44:52.664 line:82%
Let me talk to him for a minute. Sir.

393
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:54.711 line:82%
Sameer.

394
00:44:55.902 --> 00:44:57.729 line:82%
You must be back before 10 every night.

395
00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.197 line:82%
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

396
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.833 line:82%
-That's really sweet--
-I don't like changes, Mr. Aryan.

397
00:45:02.784 --> 00:45:03.910 line:82%
I know, sir.

398
00:45:04.536 --> 00:45:05.662 line:82%
I'm good, aren't I?

399
00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:07.455 line:82%
You're the best, sir.

400
00:45:16.506 --> 00:45:19.008 line:82%
How can one live without love?

401
00:45:20.609 --> 00:45:23.370 line:82%
How can one die unloved?

402
00:45:24.472 --> 00:45:28.184 line:82%
How can one live without love?
How can one die unloved?

403
00:45:28.601 --> 00:45:30.630 line:82%
Sweeter than sugarcane!
Love, Love

404
00:45:30.724 --> 00:45:32.689 line:82%
More sour than tamarind.
Love, Love

405
00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:36.526 line:82%
This is love
Yes, this is love

406
00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:43.980 line:82%
Uncle, what happened why did you stop?

407
00:45:46.828 --> 00:45:48.153 line:82%
Preeto's come.

408
00:45:48.496 --> 00:45:53.626 line:82%
Follow closely the route I have taken

409
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.653 line:82%
O turbaned one, watch out, for while
Returning home, I lost my nose pin

410
00:45:56.748 --> 00:45:59.799 line:82%
You came close

411
00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:04.512 line:82%
And smiled at me

412
00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:09.267 line:82%
You have no idea

413
00:46:09.642 --> 00:46:11.936 line:82%
What sort of dreams
You've made me see

414
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:15.899 line:82%
Now, my heart

415
00:46:15.984 --> 00:46:18.401 line:82%
Neither wakes nor sleeps

416
00:46:18.818 --> 00:46:23.656 line:82%
What am I to do
Something stirs within me

417
00:46:29.746 --> 00:46:32.248 line:82%
Jaggi, Preeto's coming here.

418
00:46:33.374 --> 00:46:35.084 line:82%
Yes, but today she is coming,

419
00:46:35.168 --> 00:46:38.796 line:82%
with a smile on her face
and not with her shoe in her hand.

420
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.049 line:82%
-What are you saying?
-Yeah!

421
00:46:42.509 --> 00:46:46.596 line:82%
-Excuse me, Kake ji.
-One minute. Go away.

422
00:46:47.555 --> 00:46:48.640 line:82%
Yes?

423
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:52.482 line:82%
-Kakeji.
-Yes, ma'am?

424
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:57.190 line:82%
-Something stirs within you?
-Yes, ma'am.

425
00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.966 line:82%
-Where?
-No, here.

426
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:05.732 line:82%
To tell you the truth, Kakeji,
something stirs within me too.

427
00:47:06.658 --> 00:47:07.998 line:82%
-Oh, really.
-Yes.

428
00:47:08.952 --> 00:47:10.011 line:82%
Where?

429
00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:12.912 line:82%
Here.

430
00:47:16.918 --> 00:47:22.215 line:82%
-Kakeji, did you remember something?
-Yes, ma'am, I remembered.

431
00:47:22.632 --> 00:47:27.062 line:82%
-So, now does something stir within you?
-No, ma'am, nothing is stirring.

432
00:47:27.637 --> 00:47:30.624 line:82%
-Jolly good.
-Very good, ma'am.

433
00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:34.143 line:82%
Eat sugar and die! Stupid.

434
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.123 line:82%
Next time I'll kill you.

435
00:47:36.226 --> 00:47:39.190 line:82%
Oh, this is love

436
00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.144 line:82%
Ishika, Ishika!
Miss Monica is calling you!

437
00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:54.409 line:82%
Oh, my.

438
00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.971 line:82%
Come in.

439
00:48:01.004 --> 00:48:02.338 line:82%
Did you call me, Ma'am?

440
00:48:02.422 --> 00:48:07.135 line:82%
Yes, Ishika come in.
Your cousin, Viren, has come to see you.

441
00:48:08.087 --> 00:48:13.061 line:82%
I told him that I do not like visitors
who do not take prior permission,

442
00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:16.115 line:82%
but I believe
there is some sort of emergency,

443
00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:18.061 line:82%
so I have given him permission.

444
00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:20.936 line:82%
But make sure it doesn't happen again.

445
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:22.567 line:82%
Yes, ma'am.

446
00:48:28.531 --> 00:48:30.867 line:82%
Excuse me... You!

447
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:35.038 line:82%
My dear Ishika, how have you been?
Quickly put your arm around me,

448
00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:38.875 line:82%
otherwise I will tell Miss Monica
about your morning visits to Gurukul.

449
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:46.883 line:82%
I am seeing you after so many years

450
00:48:46.966 --> 00:48:49.052 line:82%
and just look at how you've really grown.

451
00:48:49.135 --> 00:48:51.861 line:82%
Come, let's sit down. Come!

452
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.266 line:82%
Miss Monica...

453
00:48:55.683 --> 00:48:58.102 line:82%
Keep smiling, keep smiling, that's lovely.

454
00:48:58.519 --> 00:49:01.731 line:82%
Now you must be wondering what
the hell I am doing here, right?

455
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:04.317 line:82%
The thing is, Ishika,
ever since I've seen you,

456
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.319 line:82%
Your face keeps flashing before my eyes

457
00:49:06.402 --> 00:49:09.280 line:82%
and you've even started appearing
in my dreams at night.

458
00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:14.035 line:82%
And I am sure I must be in your dreams
too, right? I knew it...

459
00:49:14.327 --> 00:49:16.663 line:82%
I feel like there is no point
in wasting any time now.

460
00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:19.032 line:82%
If I keep seeing you
and you keep seeing me,

461
00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:23.086 line:82%
but we never say anything to each other,
wouldn't that be so stupid?

462
00:49:23.169 --> 00:49:25.812 line:82%
I feel we should
take our love story further.

463
00:49:26.583 --> 00:49:30.423 line:82%
So I will wait for you on Sunday
at the Mall Road Coffee House at 4:00.

464
00:49:31.052 --> 00:49:35.473 line:82%
-Just be there. Okay?
-Never.

465
00:49:35.556 --> 00:49:38.685 line:82%
-Never? Miss Monica...
-Okay.

466
00:49:38.768 --> 00:49:41.145 line:82%
So sweet. Come.
Let's say bye to Miss Monica.

467
00:49:52.865 --> 00:49:55.271 line:82%
Excuse me. My name is Karan, and yours?

468
00:49:57.078 --> 00:49:58.805 line:82%
Hi! I'm Karan.

469
00:50:00.746 --> 00:50:02.792 line:82%
What did you say your name was?

470
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:06.568 line:82%
How do you end up hurting yourself
in the same place, all the time?

471
00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:08.881 line:82%
Sorry, what?

472
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:12.896 line:82%
I asked how you end up hurting yourself
in the same place all the time?

473
00:50:13.553 --> 00:50:18.474 line:82%
I do not know, maybe
my mind is elsewhere these days.

474
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:21.680 line:82%
Did you always want to be a doctor?

475
00:50:23.091 --> 00:50:24.313 line:82%
I am not a doctor.

476
00:50:24.397 --> 00:50:27.601 line:82%
-Oh! So you're a nurse
in this hospital, right?

477
00:50:28.202 --> 00:50:29.485 line:82%
I do not work here.

478
00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:32.035 line:82%
My father built this hospital

479
00:50:32.488 --> 00:50:34.771 line:82%
and he had left the decoration
of this room to me.

480
00:50:35.408 --> 00:50:39.120 line:82%
Since then I just come here
to spend some time with these kids.

481
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:43.291 line:82%
-So, what do you do?
-Nothing.

482
00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:45.960 line:82%
Wow. I wish I could do nothing.

483
00:50:49.297 --> 00:50:52.842 line:82%
Excuse me? I have been wanting
to ask you something.

484
00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:58.473 line:82%
The other night I saw you at the station.
You were standing all alone.

485
00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:02.188 line:82%
The train came, and I turned to look
at you and you had walked away,

486
00:51:02.727 --> 00:51:06.647 line:82%
I couldn't understand anything,
were you waiting for someone?

487
00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:11.903 line:82%
If you do not want to talk about it
it's okay, no problem.

488
00:51:15.615 --> 00:51:18.596 line:82%
You saw the girl standing at the station,

489
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:22.371 line:82%
but you did not see her red, bridal dress,

490
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:29.003 line:82%
the henna on her hands,
the vermilion on her forehead,

491
00:51:30.346 --> 00:51:34.634 line:82%
It was Karva Chauth.
I was waiting for my husband.

492
00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:48.940 line:82%
No, no, son, if you can't pay today,
pay it tomorrow.

493
00:51:50.691 --> 00:51:51.859 line:82%
What are you doing, man?

494
00:51:53.152 --> 00:51:56.047 line:82%
-Hey, Sameer, come here.
-Yes?

495
00:51:56.371 --> 00:52:00.318 line:82%
Why are girls and boys giving red
and yellow flowers to one another today?

496
00:52:00.409 --> 00:52:01.806 line:82%
Kakeji, today is rose day.

497
00:52:01.887 --> 00:52:04.444 line:82%
-Rose day? You mean, the flower Rose day.
-Yes, sir.

498
00:52:05.081 --> 00:52:08.626 line:82%
I have heard about Republic day
Independence day, Happy Birthday.

499
00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:12.004 line:82%
-What is this Rose day all about?
-It is a very special day, sir.

500
00:52:12.088 --> 00:52:15.800 line:82%
Today, you can give any girl a rose
and tell her what you feel for her

501
00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:19.136 line:82%
-and she cannot refuse it.
-This is a very nice day.

502
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.388 line:82%
Definitely, sir, see.

503
00:52:20.513 --> 00:52:22.962 line:82%
Yellow rose is for friendship,
and red rose is for love.

504
00:52:23.046 --> 00:52:25.638 line:82%
Hey, keep the yellow in your pocket,
I need only the red rose.

505
00:52:26.102 --> 00:52:28.159 line:82%
Why do you leave
all the cleaning up to me?

506
00:52:28.263 --> 00:52:29.627 line:82%
Navneet, these days you are...

507
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.651 line:82%
Preetoji, where did you go?

508
00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:43.651 line:82%
Never mind Kakeji, never mind.

509
00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:47.568 line:82%
-Happy loose day, ma'am.
-What?

510
00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:50.751 line:82%
I mean, happy Rose day, ma'am.
Happy Rose day!

511
00:52:50.835 --> 00:52:51.836 line:82%
Rose day?

512
00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:53.588 line:82%
Yes, ma'am, today is a very special day.

513
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:57.023 line:82%
Today you will have to accept Kake's
rose today you cannot refuse me.

514
00:52:57.717 --> 00:53:00.011 line:82%
-Is that so?
-Yes, ma'am, you can ask anyone.

515
00:53:00.094 --> 00:53:03.523 line:82%
No, Kakeji, why ask anyone?

516
00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:06.475 line:82%
Since you are saying today is Rose day,

517
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:08.936 line:82%
why don't you put it with your own hands.

518
00:53:09.437 --> 00:53:11.279 line:82%
-What?
-Yes.

519
00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:15.843 line:82%
-Preetoji?
-Yes, sir.

520
00:53:15.927 --> 00:53:17.854 line:82%
You are really looking like Juliet.

521
00:53:18.863 --> 00:53:24.410 line:82%
Oh, my Romeo, on this occasion,

522
00:53:24.493 --> 00:53:26.794 line:82%
I want to give you something special.

523
00:53:27.788 --> 00:53:30.143 line:82%
-So give it, ma'am.
-Should I?

524
00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.540 line:82%
Then, here it is.

525
00:53:33.294 --> 00:53:35.046 line:82%
Eat sugar and die,

526
00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:38.471 line:82%
to hell with your Rose day,
do not mess with Preeto.

527
00:53:38.534 --> 00:53:40.968 line:82%
Happy Rose day. Happy Republic day.

528
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:43.046 line:82%
One cheese burger for table three.

529
00:53:54.607 --> 00:53:58.986 line:82%
Forget friendship today, just say it.

530
00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:11.516 line:82%
-Hey, babe.
-Where the hell have you been, Deepak?

531
00:54:11.602 --> 00:54:14.961 line:82%
I have been waiting for you
for half an hour.

532
00:54:15.074 --> 00:54:16.128 line:82%
I'm sorry, babe.

533
00:54:16.212 --> 00:54:19.548 line:82%
What sorry, Deepak. You just do not care
for anyone else's time.

534
00:54:19.632 --> 00:54:23.174 line:82%
You see, I got late trying
to find you these beautiful flowers.

535
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.008 line:82%
Happy Rose day, babe.

536
00:54:27.999 --> 00:54:30.267 line:82%
-Last time.
-Okay, my princess.

537
00:54:30.363 --> 00:54:32.316 line:82%
Now, give me a hug. Come on. Yeah!

538
00:54:37.248 --> 00:54:38.275 line:82%
That's my girl.

539
00:54:38.359 --> 00:54:41.438 line:82%
-Come on, let me introduce you to Sameer.
-Who's that?

540
00:54:45.908 --> 00:54:47.118 line:82%
-Sameer.
-Hi, Sanju.

541
00:54:47.368 --> 00:54:49.892 line:82%
This is my friend
whom I wanted you to meet.

542
00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:54.425 line:82%
-Shocked you, didn't I?
-Definitely, shocked me.

543
00:54:54.959 --> 00:54:59.338 line:82%
Deepak, this is Sameer,
my oldest and dearest friend.

544
00:54:59.922 --> 00:55:02.777 line:82%
And Sameer, this is Deepak,
the love of my life.

545
00:55:04.593 --> 00:55:07.939 line:82%
Nice to see you, man. Is this cafe yours?

546
00:55:08.389 --> 00:55:09.974 line:82%
No, I work here.

547
00:55:10.224 --> 00:55:13.452 line:82%
-You mean to say you're a waiter here.
-Yes.

548
00:55:14.805 --> 00:55:15.834 line:82%
Excuse me.

549
00:55:15.928 --> 00:55:18.482 line:82%
Okay, come on, come with us.
We have come to pick you up.

550
00:55:18.566 --> 00:55:20.164 line:82%
We're going for a movie with friends.

551
00:55:20.247 --> 00:55:22.319 line:82%
I can't come, Sanju. I have a lot of work.

552
00:55:22.403 --> 00:55:25.031 line:82%
Come on, Sameer,
you can take leave for one day.

553
00:55:25.356 --> 00:55:27.199 line:82%
No, I cannot. I have just joined here.

554
00:55:27.283 --> 00:55:29.702 line:82%
Okay, Sanjana. Let's go, we gotta go.
See you, dude.

555
00:55:30.202 --> 00:55:32.163 line:82%
-Come, no, Sameer.
-Really can't.

556
00:55:32.231 --> 00:55:33.686 line:82%
Come on, Sanjana.

557
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:36.917 line:82%
Okay, see you.

558
00:55:37.001 --> 00:55:38.169 line:82%
And, Sanju...

559
00:55:40.212 --> 00:55:41.329 line:82%
Happy Rose day, Sanju.

560
00:55:45.612 --> 00:55:46.660 line:82%
Thanks.

561
00:55:59.065 --> 00:56:01.335 line:82%
So, what are you going to do now?

562
00:56:02.777 --> 00:56:03.863 line:82%
Nothing.

563
00:56:06.014 --> 00:56:07.490 line:82%
I'll just never meet her again.

564
00:56:09.849 --> 00:56:10.929 line:82%
Never go in front of her.

565
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:14.829 line:82%
I'll just forget her.

566
00:56:15.664 --> 00:56:16.832 line:82%
Wonderful.

567
00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:22.622 line:82%
Very good. You're doing very well.

568
00:56:23.005 --> 00:56:24.381 line:82%
You're on the right track.

569
00:56:25.202 --> 00:56:28.583 line:82%
If I'm not mistaken, she's the same girl
for whom you crossed the gate that night.

570
00:56:28.666 --> 00:56:30.011 line:82%
-Right?
-Yes, sir.

571
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:33.974 line:82%
And today you want to forget her,
just because she loves someone else.

572
00:56:34.767 --> 00:56:37.311 line:82%
Very good, that's really great.

573
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:41.771 line:82%
Excuse me, sir, there are some people
who fall in love, but their love

574
00:56:42.525 --> 00:56:46.572 line:82%
is not reciprocated.
Everyone does not have your kind of luck.

575
00:56:49.115 --> 00:56:52.645 line:82%
I pray to God everyday, Karan,
that no one has my kind of luck,

576
00:56:54.245 --> 00:56:55.871 line:82%
especially not you three.

577
00:56:59.708 --> 00:57:01.394 line:82%
At least Sameer loves someone,

578
00:57:02.498 --> 00:57:07.299 line:82%
who he can see, whose laughter he can
hear, who he can speak to.

579
00:57:09.677 --> 00:57:11.053 line:82%
I can't even do that.

580
00:57:12.054 --> 00:57:13.139 line:82%
Why not, sir?

581
00:57:16.267 --> 00:57:21.063 line:82%
Because the girl I love... is no more.

582
00:57:24.066 --> 00:57:25.442 line:82%
She's dead.

583
00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:31.115 line:82%
-I'm sorry, sir.
-No, don't be.

584
00:57:32.074 --> 00:57:33.200 line:82%
I'm not.

585
00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:36.303 line:82%
I did not fall in love with her
on the condition

586
00:57:36.376 --> 00:57:37.955 line:82%
that she would live longer than me.

587
00:57:38.998 --> 00:57:43.127 line:82%
There are no conditions in love,
so there shouldn't be any regrets.

588
00:57:45.045 --> 00:57:50.509 line:82%
So what if today she is not with me,
I still love her the same way,

589
00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:53.678 line:82%
not because
I can't find someone else to love,

590
00:57:54.889 --> 00:57:59.518 line:82%
but because loving her makes me happy.

591
00:58:02.021 --> 00:58:07.151 line:82%
Whenever I miss her, I close my eyes
and she is with me.

592
00:58:09.658 --> 00:58:10.678 line:82%
Sameer...

593
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.324 line:82%
You didn't fall in love with her

594
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:16.744 line:82%
on the condition
that she will love you too,

595
00:58:18.078 --> 00:58:21.142 line:82%
but today, just because she loves
someone else, you wish to forget her.

596
00:58:23.792 --> 00:58:26.712 line:82%
Don't let your love be defeated so easily.

597
00:58:31.884 --> 00:58:33.666 line:82%
Love is just like life,

598
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.483 line:82%
it's not always easy,
and it does not always bring happiness,

599
00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:44.855 line:82%
but when we do not abandon life,
why should we abandon love?

600
00:58:48.484 --> 00:58:51.528 line:82%
I'm sorry, that lecture dragged on a bit.

601
00:58:52.821 --> 00:58:55.282 line:82%
If Mr. Narayan Shankar sees you here,

602
00:58:55.616 --> 00:58:58.699 line:82%
then all the love stories will come
to an end today itself. Come on, go on.

603
00:58:59.063 --> 00:59:01.497 line:82%
-Thank you, good night. Go on, fast.
-Good night, sir.

604
00:59:04.792 --> 00:59:09.088 line:82%
Love is just like life,
it's not always easy

605
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:11.280 line:82%
and it does not always bring happiness.

606
00:59:12.007 --> 00:59:16.025 line:82%
But when we do not abandon life,
why should we abandon love?

607
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:26.522 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

608
00:59:28.691 --> 00:59:30.206 line:82%
Made you wait for a long time?

609
00:59:34.818 --> 00:59:35.906 line:82%
I'm sorry.

610
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:37.962 line:82%
It's okay.

611
00:59:39.578 --> 00:59:40.606 line:82%
Dance?

612
01:00:38.052 --> 01:00:43.717 line:82%
This is for hugging me that day.
I know what guys like you are all about.

613
01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.949 line:82%
But this time you have messed
with the wrong girl.

614
01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:50.541 line:82%
My name is Ishika Dhanrajgir,

615
01:00:50.754 --> 01:00:54.380 line:82%
and I can employ 100 boys
like you as servants in my house.

616
01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:58.447 line:82%
So next time, before fooling around

617
01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:02.590 line:82%
with any girl, remember this slap
and Ishika Dhanrajgir.

618
01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:05.589 line:82%
Come on, girls, let's go.

619
01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:10.773 line:82%
-You're okay.
-Excuse me?

620
01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.216 line:82%
Thank you, Miss Dhanrajgir.

621
01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:32.868 line:82%
By slapping me,
you have taught me a lesson.

622
01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.013 line:82%
Thank you very much.

623
01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:40.572 line:82%
But ma'am, this really was my first time,

624
01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:43.597 line:82%
and I was unaware
of the rules of this game.

625
01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:49.832 line:82%
I did not know one had to exchange one's
bank accounts before asking a girl out.

626
01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:51.834 line:82%
I didn't know.

627
01:01:52.418 --> 01:01:55.712 line:82%
If I knew this, I would have introduced
myself much earlier to you,

628
01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:57.381 line:82%
my name is Vikram Oberoi,

629
01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.488 line:82%
and my father is one of the leading
industrialists of this nation,

630
01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:06.765 line:82%
and if he wants, he can employ
your father, but I am so naive,

631
01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:10.329 line:82%
I was not aware of the importance
of all this.

632
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:17.526 line:82%
I just knew
that I had seen a beautiful girl,

633
01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:22.781 line:82%
who I wanted to get to know,
and become friends with.

634
01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:29.329 line:82%
I thought this was enough to ask someone
out for a date. How stupid I was, right?

635
01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:34.793 line:82%
But now I have understood.
Next time I won't get slapped.

636
01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:39.381 line:82%
Thank you once again, Miss Dhanrajgir.

637
01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.229 line:82%
Thank you.

638
01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.220 line:82%
Come on, Ishika, come, let's go.

639
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.870 line:82%
Hey, Vicky, well done, man.
You shut her up, man,

640
01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:59.985 line:82%
And I was not aware that my friend
was the son of such a rich man.

641
01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:03.906 line:82%
What do you think
if I was the son of such a rich man,

642
01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.700 line:82%
-would I be a waiter's friend?
-What? What do you mean?

643
01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.952 line:82%
-My dad works in a bank.
-What?

644
01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:12.414 line:82%
-Yes.
-Then, what was all this?

645
01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:15.498 line:82%
I had to shut the daughter of a rich man,
so I just made myself richer

646
01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:18.103 line:82%
and she shut up. Simple as that.
Give me a coke, man.

647
01:03:18.209 --> 01:03:20.174 line:82%
-I don't believe you.
-Okay, forget this,

648
01:03:20.267 --> 01:03:23.486 line:82%
tell me, are all beautiful girls snooty?

649
01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.364 line:82%
Well, since they're beautiful,
they are bound to be a little proud.

650
01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.968 line:82%
-Is your Sanjana also like this?
-Not at all.

651
01:03:30.781 --> 01:03:34.019 line:82%
-She is very sweet.
-Then she must be very ugly.

652
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:37.898 line:82%
Hey, Vicky! I'll kill you!
If you say anything about her...

653
01:03:38.774 --> 01:03:40.442 line:82%
Sameer, we're friends, right?

654
01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:45.364 line:82%
I had seen Kiran for the first time
on this very platform.

655
01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.940 line:82%
She'd gotten married
with great pomp and ceremony.

656
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:54.623 line:82%
And it was also the last time
I saw her smile,

657
01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:01.171 line:82%
because her husband had to leave
that very night.

658
01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:08.929 line:82%
There's some tension at the border
and he's a pilot in the Indian Air Force.

659
01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:14.476 line:82%
He left his newly-wed wife
to serve his duty.

660
01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.939 line:82%
Since then, she often comes here,

661
01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:21.921 line:82%
hoping to see her husband

662
01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:26.488 line:82%
get down from the train.

663
01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:29.612 line:82%
But everybody knows
that isn't gonna happen.

664
01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.578 line:82%
Because two years ago, we got to hear

665
01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:35.102 line:82%
that two planes were found
missing at the border.

666
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:39.668 line:82%
I feel that even she knows
that her husband is no more

667
01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:45.966 line:82%
But she still comes here to please
one man, her husband's father,

668
01:04:46.573 --> 01:04:47.593 line:82%
Major General Khanna.

669
01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:48.760 line:82%
Dad?

670
01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.306 line:82%
A retired army officer,

671
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:55.809 line:82%
and one of the richest men
in this town, who believes

672
01:04:55.892 --> 01:05:01.398 line:82%
that till he does not see the dead body
of his son, he is not dead.

673
01:05:02.316 --> 01:05:05.032 line:82%
He insists that Kiran dutifully fulfills

674
01:05:05.596 --> 01:05:07.779 line:82%
all the customs expected
of a married girl.

675
01:05:08.739 --> 01:05:12.528 line:82%
Kiran's only friend is her sister-in-law,

676
01:05:12.961 --> 01:05:14.332 line:82%
-Nandini.
-Sis.

677
01:05:14.416 --> 01:05:18.832 line:82%
She is the wife
of Major Khanna's elder son,

678
01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.674 line:82%
who's a computer engineer in the military

679
01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:24.004 line:82%
and is away most of the time.

680
01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:28.967 line:82%
Nandini loves Kiran like a sister
and wants to see her happy.

681
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.576 line:82%
She has a naughty son named Ayush.

682
01:05:32.819 --> 01:05:36.433 line:82%
He is the bright light
in Kiran's dark life,

683
01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:41.688 line:82%
He makes her laugh, cry,
he plays with her and fights with her.

684
01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:46.943 line:82%
Kiran forgets all her pains and sorrows
and she becomes a child with him.

685
01:05:47.486 --> 01:05:52.157 line:82%
She is, after all, just 19 years old.

686
01:05:52.908 --> 01:05:57.329 line:82%
This is Kiran, who had had come here
to laugh and love

687
01:05:58.372 --> 01:06:00.582 line:82%
hope she gets her share of happiness.

688
01:06:03.085 --> 01:06:08.674 line:82%
I promise you, Khan Baba, she will
definitely get her share of happiness.

689
01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:11.301 line:82%
For sure.

690
01:06:27.943 --> 01:06:30.780 line:82%
-Good morning, Mr. Aryan.
-Good morning, sir.

691
01:06:31.617 --> 01:06:32.836 line:82%
What exactly are you doing?

692
01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:35.338 line:82%
The same thing you were doing, sir.

693
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.279 line:82%
I was doing the Sun Salutation.

694
01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:45.293 line:82%
So am I. It's just that you do it
your way and I do it my way.

695
01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:53.927 line:82%
Excuse me, sir.
I wanted to ask you, why do you do it?

696
01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:59.224 line:82%
It makes we feel good
to stare directly at the sun,

697
01:07:00.429 --> 01:07:02.829 line:82%
-without having to blink my eyes.
-Okay.

698
01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:06.203 line:82%
I feel I am not weaker than the sun.

699
01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:10.402 line:82%
I like it. Why do you do it?

700
01:07:11.174 --> 01:07:14.276 line:82%
Just like that, sir, unlike you,
I don't have a battle going on with sun,

701
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:19.566 line:82%
I just enjoy basking in the sunshine.
That is what I call Sun Salutation.

702
01:07:21.013 --> 01:07:24.713 line:82%
Excuse me, sir.
I wanted to ask you for something.

703
01:07:26.149 --> 01:07:27.169 line:82%
Yes, go on.

704
01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.671 line:82%
Sir, I do not know if you're aware,
today is Holi,

705
01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:31.882 line:82%
and I wanted the students to celebrate it.

706
01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:35.015 line:82%
But I have been told that Holi
has never been celebrated here in Gurukul.

707
01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:39.473 line:82%
Holi has never been celebrated here
for the simple reason that

708
01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:42.641 line:82%
no one has ever wanted to, at least,
no one has asked me before.

709
01:07:43.185 --> 01:07:46.220 line:82%
Sir, no one has asked you
because everybody is scared of you.

710
01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:49.524 line:82%
And you are not scared of me, Mr. Aryan?

711
01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:55.238 line:82%
No, sir. I have never been scared
of doing the right thing.

712
01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:57.699 line:82%
As long as I am convinced

713
01:07:58.325 --> 01:08:02.037 line:82%
that I am not asking for anything wrong,
I am not scared.

714
01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:07.804 line:82%
Holi has never been and never will be
celebrated inside Gurukul,

715
01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.296 line:82%
however, I have nothing
against this festival.

716
01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:15.122 line:82%
If some of them wish to celebrate,
they can go outside Gurukul and do so.

717
01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:17.636 line:82%
Thank you very much, sir.

718
01:08:19.721 --> 01:08:20.972 line:82%
Excuse me, sir.

719
01:08:31.483 --> 01:08:35.278 line:82%
Where I come from, there
is a tradition of starting this day

720
01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:38.740 line:82%
by putting a tilaka
on the eldest of the family.

721
01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:41.451 line:82%
If you do not mind,

722
01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:44.209 line:82%
on behalf of my students and me,
I'd like to put this on you.

723
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.545 line:82%
I'll just put a little, sir.

724
01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:02.806 line:82%
Happy Holi, sir.

725
01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:12.524 line:82%
Hey, Raj...

726
01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.239 line:82%
What?

727
01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:20.949 line:82%
Happy Holi.

728
01:10:09.998 --> 01:10:13.752 line:82%
O' golden-eyed one

729
01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:18.882 line:82%
Whether you give me your heart
Or whether you chide me

730
01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:23.345 line:82%
O' golden-eyed one

731
01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:28.892 line:82%
Whether you give me your heart
Or whether you chide me

732
01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:33.584 line:82%
We're crazy about you

733
01:10:34.481 --> 01:10:39.152 line:82%
We're your playful paramours

734
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.614 line:82%
We're crazy about you

735
01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:47.869 line:82%
We're your playful paramours

736
01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:57.504 line:82%
You liars

737
01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:02.801 line:82%
That innocent face hides a black heart

738
01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:07.847 line:82%
You liars

739
01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:12.060 line:82%
That innocent face hides a black heart

740
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.357 line:82%
These Romeos are ruinous

741
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.570 line:82%
They will break every heart

742
01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:27.534 line:82%
These Romeos are ruinous

743
01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:31.788 line:82%
They will break every heart

744
01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:24.674 line:82%
Go on, lass

745
01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:26.968 line:82%
Do what you will

746
01:12:27.052 --> 01:12:31.306 line:82%
Your whole body is now smeared with color

747
01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:33.808 line:82%
Hey, you

748
01:12:34.347 --> 01:12:36.311 line:82%
I swear

749
01:12:36.648 --> 01:12:40.857 line:82%
I'm going to have you hung from a noose

750
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:45.667 line:82%
I'll brave the noose for you
Just tell me, I'll die right now

751
01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:48.114 line:82%
If I am ever scared by you

752
01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:50.533 line:82%
My heart will then be yours

753
01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:52.827 line:82%
Remember my words

754
01:12:52.911 --> 01:12:55.288 line:82%
These two hearts will be one, one day

755
01:12:55.830 --> 01:13:00.043 line:82%
We're crazy about you

756
01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:05.173 line:82%
We're playful paramours

757
01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:10.011 line:82%
These Romeos are ruinous

758
01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:14.682 line:82%
They will break every heart

759
01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:16.202 line:82%
Why are you standing so far away?

760
01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.999 line:82%
Are you high on something?

761
01:14:23.168 --> 01:14:28.089 line:82%
Why are you standing so far away?
You're so close to my heart

762
01:14:28.173 --> 01:14:31.301 line:82%
Embrace me, just find an excuse

763
01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:39.976 line:82%
Are you high on something?
So what, if the girl is far away

764
01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:43.855 line:82%
I still came when you beckoned

765
01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.400 line:82%
You should've thought
Before taking the leap

766
01:14:47.475 --> 01:14:50.153 line:82%
Now that you've come,
Don't go away

767
01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:53.990 line:82%
We're crazy about you

768
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:58.578 line:82%
We're playful paramours

769
01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:03.249 line:82%
These Romeos are ruinous

770
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:08.963 line:82%
They will break every heart

771
01:15:53.508 --> 01:15:57.637 line:82%
Be there sorrow, or be there joy

772
01:15:58.513 --> 01:16:02.058 line:82%
The easterly still blows

773
01:16:03.268 --> 01:16:07.814 line:82%
One comes, another goes

774
01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:12.318 line:82%
Why are you holding
Your heart back?

775
01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:17.657 line:82%
I'm not holding my heart back

776
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:22.495 line:82%
My heart holds me back

777
01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:27.750 line:82%
Will someone please tell me

778
01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:31.921 line:82%
What's is true and what deception

779
01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:33.923 line:82%
Everything in the world

780
01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:36.092 line:82%
Is so lovely

781
01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:38.845 line:82%
That's the only truth

782
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:42.181 line:82%
Aren't these colors so lovely?

783
01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:46.561 line:82%
We're crazy about you

784
01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:50.940 line:82%
We're playful paramours

785
01:16:51.901 --> 01:16:56.404 line:82%
These Romeos are ruinous

786
01:16:56.779 --> 01:17:00.867 line:82%
They will break every heart

787
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:05.163 line:82%
O' golden-eyed one

788
01:17:06.331 --> 01:17:10.293 line:82%
Either give me your heart,
Or chide me

789
01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:14.130 line:82%
You liars

790
01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:20.762 line:82%
That innocent face hides a black heart

791
01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:25.850 line:82%
We're crazy about you

792
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:30.480 line:82%
We're playful paramours

793
01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:35.151 line:82%
These Romeos are ruinous

794
01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:39.614 line:82%
They will break every heart

795
01:17:40.448 --> 01:17:44.452 line:82%
I'm crazy about you

796
01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:48.790 line:82%
I'm your playful paramour

797
01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:53.628 line:82%
These Romeos are ruinous

798
01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.591 line:82%
They will break every heart

799
01:18:32.722 --> 01:18:34.085 line:82%
Hey, guys, listen to my new song?

800
01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:37.213 line:82%
Oh, Vicky, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind

801
01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:38.324 line:82%
Hey, Vicky.

802
01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:45.888 line:82%
Go on.

803
01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:00.279 line:82%
Yeah, what?

804
01:19:01.988 --> 01:19:06.556 line:82%
My friends think
that I was very rude to you at the cafe,

805
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:09.829 line:82%
the other day, and I must apologize.

806
01:19:10.098 --> 01:19:12.523 line:82%
Oh...and what do you think?

807
01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.329 line:82%
I think they are right.

808
01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:19.197 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

809
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:23.009 line:82%
My friends think
that you were in the wrong, too,

810
01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.791 line:82%
and you should also apologize.

811
01:19:26.304 --> 01:19:27.730 line:82%
And what do you think?

812
01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.975 line:82%
I think they are right.

813
01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.788 line:82%
Okay. I'm sorry.

814
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.052 line:82%
Good. Now we are quits.

815
01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:40.346 line:82%
-No, we are not.
-Why not?

816
01:19:41.194 --> 01:19:44.457 line:82%
Because that day you slapped me
and I have still not hit you.

817
01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:48.082 line:82%
So, you want to slap me?

818
01:19:48.609 --> 01:19:49.724 line:82%
Yeah, I'd like to.

819
01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.769 line:82%
You want to hit a girl?

820
01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:56.196 line:82%
Well, if the girl insists
on quitting things, what can I do.

821
01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:02.048 line:82%
All right, I want to finish this,
once and for all.

822
01:20:03.898 --> 01:20:07.887 line:82%
Hit me. Hit me.

823
01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:11.912 line:82%
Come on, hit me.

824
01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:21.789 line:82%
Actually, let it be,
my hands will get dirty.

825
01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:25.695 line:82%
What the hell do you think of yourself?

826
01:20:26.781 --> 01:20:29.347 line:82%
My friends were totally wrong
about you and I was right.

827
01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:35.425 line:82%
You donkey, you monkey.

828
01:20:36.207 --> 01:20:37.208 line:82%
You dog!

829
01:20:47.051 --> 01:20:48.714 line:82%
You, how come you are here?

830
01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:50.651 line:82%
I have come to tell you something.

831
01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:52.608 line:82%
-To tell me something?
-Yes.

832
01:20:53.266 --> 01:20:56.182 line:82%
But before that you will have
to promise me that you won't get angry.

833
01:20:56.889 --> 01:20:58.263 line:82%
Okay, I won't.

834
01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:04.986 line:82%
I found out everything about your life,
about why you go to the station,

835
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:09.198 line:82%
about your husband,
Major Khanna, everything.

836
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:14.579 line:82%
I was brought up with the belief
that boys are the tough ones

837
01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:19.667 line:82%
and girls are weak,
but you made me realize how untrue it is.

838
01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:23.796 line:82%
You are very different from other girls
and it would be an honor for me

839
01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.339 line:82%
if we could be friends.

840
01:21:27.206 --> 01:21:29.332 line:82%
You promised me
that you will not get angry.

841
01:21:32.138 --> 01:21:33.409 line:82%
I am not angry.

842
01:21:35.016 --> 01:21:38.018 line:82%
It is just that I am not used
to hearing nice things about myself.

843
01:21:40.566 --> 01:21:43.190 line:82%
I am a married girl,
living in a small town.

844
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.779 line:82%
Here, a boy and a girl
can never be friends.

845
01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:53.451 line:82%
It is considered wrong, and I
don't have the strength to prove it right.

846
01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:57.562 line:82%
You overestimated me.

847
01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:01.626 line:82%
I'm not that strong.

848
01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:06.027 line:82%
Who are you and me to decide
what is wrong and right?

849
01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:10.343 line:82%
That's his job. Let's leave it to him.

850
01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:15.890 line:82%
We can only follow our hearts.
That's exactly what I am doing.

851
01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:21.312 line:82%
Now, it's your turn.
If your heart says that it is right,

852
01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:22.920 line:82%
then extend your hand.

853
01:22:23.898 --> 01:22:25.791 line:82%
But if your heart says that this is wrong,

854
01:22:26.694 --> 01:22:31.070 line:82%
then walk away, and I promise
never to cross paths with you again.

855
01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.266 line:82%
Hi. My name is Karan. And yours?

856
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:48.964 line:82%
Friends don't address each other
so formally. I'm Kiran.

857
01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:53.177 line:82%
-Great, lets go.
-Hey. At least do your prayers.

858
01:22:54.512 --> 01:22:57.816 line:82%
No need, my prayers are done. Let's leave.

859
01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:04.522 line:82%
I don't believe this, Sameer,
can't you find yourself a decent job?

860
01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:07.338 line:82%
Sanju, who is going to give
a student a part-time job here?

861
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.461 line:82%
And in any case, my mother says
that no work is big or small,

862
01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:14.822 line:82%
as long as you do it with all your heart.

863
01:23:14.912 --> 01:23:20.326 line:82%
-Okay, okay, stop giving me a lecture.
-I can't see Tom uncle, where is he?

864
01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:22.456 line:82%
-Don't ask.
-Why?

865
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.584 line:82%
For the past three hours,
he has locked himself in the room,

866
01:23:25.668 --> 01:23:26.961 line:82%
opening all the old trunks,

867
01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:30.283 line:82%
and whenever I ask him
what he is looking for, he doesn't reply.

868
01:23:30.374 --> 01:23:32.967 line:82%
I wish for neither gold nor silver

869
01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:35.344 line:82%
I wish for neither diamonds nor pearls

870
01:23:35.561 --> 01:23:39.306 line:82%
Of what use are they to me?

871
01:23:41.148 --> 01:23:42.554 line:82%
Papa, what are you doing?

872
01:23:42.632 --> 01:23:45.187 line:82%
I'm dancing, my love, I'm dancing.

873
01:23:45.272 --> 01:23:50.009 line:82%
I can see that, but why are you
wearing this pre-historic costume?

874
01:23:50.112 --> 01:23:53.506 line:82%
Because I am going for a date with Jenny.

875
01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:55.868 line:82%
Jenny aunt is going out with you?

876
01:23:55.961 --> 01:24:01.496 line:82%
Yes, after six months of wooing her,
she has finally agreed.

877
01:24:01.829 --> 01:24:04.522 line:82%
But you never wear a suit, so why today?

878
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:08.586 line:82%
You see, Jenny likes classy gentlemen,

879
01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:11.514 line:82%
thats why I thought I'll impress her
with the suit. How am I looking?

880
01:24:11.587 --> 01:24:14.091 line:82%
You are not looking good at all.
Remove this.

881
01:24:14.175 --> 01:24:15.176 line:82%
What are you saying?

882
01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:18.056 line:82%
This was your mother's favorite suit,
wasn't it, tell me?

883
01:24:18.142 --> 01:24:20.014 line:82%
Papa, that was 20 years ago.

884
01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:22.855 line:82%
So what, does a suit change
in 20 years. What say, Sameer?

885
01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.433 line:82%
I think you are looking terrific, Uncle.
Smashing, superb.

886
01:24:27.021 --> 01:24:29.332 line:82%
He doesn't know anything,
you aren't looking nice,

887
01:24:29.412 --> 01:24:31.060 line:82%
and you won't go out like this.

888
01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:35.321 line:82%
-I am going, my love. Bye bye, Sameer.
-Bye.

889
01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:41.993 line:82%
Papa. You're looking stupid, fat and ugly
and don't you dare a step out of door.

890
01:24:56.467 --> 01:25:01.772 line:82%
Relax, uncle, Sanju just talks rubbish.
Would you like some chips? Bye.

891
01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.054 line:82%
Lift your arms up.

892
01:25:16.403 --> 01:25:17.620 line:82%
Now that's my Pa.

893
01:25:18.237 --> 01:25:21.283 line:82%
Sweet, cute and adorable.

894
01:25:24.847 --> 01:25:30.599 line:82%
One should love you the way you are.

895
01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:33.600 line:82%
If someone changes you in order
to love you,

896
01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:37.258 line:82%
then they should not love,
but try their hand at business.

897
01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:43.722 line:82%
And, sweetheart, there is no room
for business in love, right?

898
01:25:46.851 --> 01:25:48.060 line:82%
Right.

899
01:25:51.564 --> 01:25:56.944 line:82%
Darling, no compromises in love

900
01:26:01.068 --> 01:26:05.494 line:82%
Me and you locked in a room

901
01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:08.581 line:82%
Sameer, have you gone mad?
Stop it, I'll hit you, behave yourself.

902
01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.416 line:82%
And the key gets lost

903
01:26:10.878 --> 01:26:13.085 line:82%
I'll be back from the conference
by tomorrow morning,

904
01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.713 line:82%
until then,
Gurukul is your responsibility.

905
01:26:15.796 --> 01:26:17.673 line:82%
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you, Mr. Sriram.

906
01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:20.765 line:82%
Good morning, sir.

907
01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:27.067 line:82%
Morning, Mr Aryan, what changes
would you like to make in Gurukul today?

908
01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:30.853 line:82%
Just a small change,
I would like you to begin the day

909
01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:33.739 line:82%
with some sweets. Today is my birthday.

910
01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:38.292 line:82%
-Congratulations, Mr Aryan.
-Thank you very much, sir.

911
01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:41.832 line:82%
I'm sorry I am not allowed
to have sweets. All the best to you.

912
01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:45.112 line:82%
Actually, sir, there was something
I wanted to ask you for.

913
01:26:48.185 --> 01:26:53.125 line:82%
I knew you would ask me for something
tell me what can I do for you.

914
01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:57.212 line:82%
Sir, I was thinking of throwing
a small party for the students,

915
01:26:57.504 --> 01:26:59.840 line:82%
they've given me so much respect
in such short time.

916
01:26:59.924 --> 01:27:04.303 line:82%
I will be very happy to do something
for them, sir, only if you permit.

917
01:27:09.516 --> 01:27:12.561 line:82%
All right, Mr Aryan.
You can have the party.

918
01:27:12.645 --> 01:27:13.690 line:82%
Thank you, sir.

919
01:27:14.141 --> 01:27:18.150 line:82%
But make sure that you do not do anything
that will spoil Gurukul's reputation.

920
01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:19.311 line:82%
No, no, not at all, sir.

921
01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:22.960 line:82%
One more small request, sir.

922
01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:25.491 line:82%
Now what, Mr Aryan?

923
01:27:25.908 --> 01:27:28.285 line:82%
Sir, most of the students
are learning music,

924
01:27:28.494 --> 01:27:30.162 line:82%
so I was thinking of having a dance party.

925
01:27:30.257 --> 01:27:33.165 line:82%
We can have a party
and they'll learn music as well.

926
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:35.334 line:82%
I was wondering
if I could invite our neighbors,

927
01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:38.350 line:82%
Miss Monica's girls to join us,
that is only if you permit, sir.

928
01:27:39.505 --> 01:27:42.322 line:82%
Till today, girls
have never entered Gurukul, Mr. Aryan,

929
01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:45.969 line:82%
and I would like
to maintain that tradition.

930
01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:52.959 line:82%
You are right, sir, but we really cannot
have a dance party without girls, sir.

931
01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:57.439 line:82%
And actually, sir,
I have sort of promised the boys.

932
01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.367 line:82%
You should have asked me
before making the promise, Mr Aryan.

933
01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:02.542 line:82%
You know that I don't like changes.

934
01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:07.866 line:82%
Come on, Ram Singh.

935
01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:04.756 line:82%
There was this infatuated girl

936
01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:08.237 line:82%
Who loved a boy to death

937
01:30:09.863 --> 01:30:11.323 line:82%
Her eyes downcast

938
01:30:12.032 --> 01:30:13.200 line:82%
She blushed

939
01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:15.564 line:82%
As she traipse down the alley

940
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:21.875 line:82%
On the sly, she'd pen her love-letters

941
01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:27.589 line:82%
Was it something she wished to say?
Oh, but whom was she afraid of?

942
01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:33.345 line:82%
And whenever we met, she'd ask me

943
01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:36.366 line:82%
How does love happen?

944
01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:39.560 line:82%
How does this love happen?

945
01:30:40.519 --> 01:30:43.063 line:82%
All I could tell her was

946
01:30:49.027 --> 01:30:52.823 line:82%
Whether your eyes are open or shut

947
01:30:57.202 --> 01:31:01.165 line:82%
You will always dream
Of your loved one

948
01:31:05.544 --> 01:31:09.339 line:82%
Oh, how do I tell you, my love

949
01:31:09.715 --> 01:31:13.677 line:82%
How love happens

950
01:31:21.643 --> 01:31:25.314 line:82%
Whether your eyes are open or shut

951
01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:29.318 line:82%
You will always dream
Of your loved one

952
01:31:29.526 --> 01:31:33.238 line:82%
Whether your eyes are open or shut

953
01:31:33.322 --> 01:31:37.242 line:82%
You will always dream
Of your loved one

954
01:31:37.451 --> 01:31:41.205 line:82%
Oh, how do I tell you, my love

955
01:31:41.288 --> 01:31:45.250 line:82%
How love happens

956
01:31:53.148 --> 01:31:56.803 line:82%
Whether your eyes are open or shut

957
01:31:57.119 --> 01:32:00.766 line:82%
You will always dream
Of your loved one

958
01:32:01.084 --> 01:32:04.728 line:82%
Oh, how do I tell you, my love?

959
01:32:05.041 --> 01:32:08.857 line:82%
How love happens

960
01:33:17.843 --> 01:33:21.722 line:82%
Today, let's see what dying

961
01:33:21.805 --> 01:33:24.725 line:82%
For someone is like

962
01:33:25.726 --> 01:33:31.648 line:82%
Let's see how it is
That love comes to be

963
01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:36.987 line:82%
I was lost thinking of someone

964
01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:41.325 line:82%
When I wove my dreams

965
01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:45.162 line:82%
I was lost in someone's arms

966
01:33:45.245 --> 01:33:49.291 line:82%
When I fell in love with him

967
01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:53.036 line:82%
When you're in love

968
01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:04.556 line:82%
You're neither awake nor asleep

969
01:34:04.973 --> 01:34:08.945 line:82%
Oh, how do I tell you, my love

970
01:34:09.036 --> 01:34:12.933 line:82%
How love happens

971
01:35:16.002 --> 01:35:21.967 line:82%
What is this spell
That binds you?

972
01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.305 line:82%
A thousand hurdles

973
01:35:27.389 --> 01:35:30.600 line:82%
The heart will overcome

974
01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:35.272 line:82%
Far away, somewhere in the Heavens,

975
01:35:35.595 --> 01:35:39.359 line:82%
All this is decided

976
01:35:39.559 --> 01:35:42.855 line:82%
Who knows when and how one will meet

977
01:35:43.205 --> 01:35:47.325 line:82%
His companion for life

978
01:35:47.409 --> 01:35:51.288 line:82%
The name that's writ on the heart

979
01:35:59.214 --> 01:36:02.549 line:82%
Is the one you will fall for

980
01:36:03.158 --> 01:36:06.845 line:82%
Oh how do I tell you, my love

981
01:36:07.118 --> 01:36:10.932 line:82%
How love happens

982
01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:22.444 line:82%
Whether your eyes are open or shut

983
01:36:22.903 --> 01:36:26.615 line:82%
You will always dream
Of your loved one

984
01:36:26.823 --> 01:36:30.202 line:82%
Whether your eyes are open or shut

985
01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:34.623 line:82%
You will always dream
Of your loved one

986
01:36:34.706 --> 01:36:40.670 line:82%
Oh how do I tell you, my love
How love happens?

987
01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:16.498 line:82%
Over.

988
01:37:23.046 --> 01:37:24.130 line:82%
No.

989
01:37:26.241 --> 01:37:27.300 line:82%
Please.

990
01:37:27.384 --> 01:37:30.386 line:82%
-Come on, Miss Monica.
-Stop it!

991
01:38:16.641 --> 01:38:20.312 line:82%
Monica, oh, my darling

992
01:40:06.418 --> 01:40:07.984 line:82%
You will have to leave, Mr. Aryan.

993
01:40:14.467 --> 01:40:16.827 line:82%
I am sorry that I had to take this step,

994
01:40:18.708 --> 01:40:20.348 line:82%
because I had begun to like you.

995
01:40:21.891 --> 01:40:24.310 line:82%
I thought that,
in spite of your new-fangled ideas,

996
01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:26.354 line:82%
I had begun to think that

997
01:40:26.438 --> 01:40:30.358 line:82%
you could become an important part
of Gurukul...but I was wrong.

998
01:40:35.071 --> 01:40:36.961 line:82%
My first instinct about you was correct,

999
01:40:39.701 --> 01:40:43.484 line:82%
you are a very arrogant
and undisciplined man.

1000
01:40:44.414 --> 01:40:46.270 line:82%
And we do not need people like you here.

1001
01:40:48.752 --> 01:40:51.591 line:82%
I want your resignation on my table
by the end of day today.

1002
01:40:59.888 --> 01:41:04.058 line:82%
Why the sniggering, Mr Aryan?

1003
01:41:06.644 --> 01:41:10.572 line:82%
I'm sorry, sir. Till today,
I had a lot of respect for you.

1004
01:41:12.168 --> 01:41:14.409 line:82%
I thought you were a very intelligent

1005
01:41:14.736 --> 01:41:19.060 line:82%
and sharp man,
a man who would never miss anything,

1006
01:41:21.201 --> 01:41:23.828 line:82%
but I am afraid...I am disappointed.

1007
01:41:24.906 --> 01:41:26.562 line:82%
What are you trying to say, Mr Aryan?

1008
01:41:29.117 --> 01:41:30.141 line:82%
Do you remember sir...

1009
01:41:31.132 --> 01:41:35.560 line:82%
when I first came here for a job,
I told you my name, Raj Aryan.

1010
01:41:37.675 --> 01:41:39.886 line:82%
Today I am going to tell you
my full name...

1011
01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:46.059 line:82%
Mr. Narayan Shankar, my full name is...

1012
01:41:47.435 --> 01:41:49.437 line:82%
Raj Aryan Malhotra.

1013
01:41:51.898 --> 01:41:54.734 line:82%
Raj A. Malhotra.

1014
01:42:03.326 --> 01:42:04.374 line:82%
Yes...

1015
01:42:06.635 --> 01:42:07.944 line:82%
I am the same Raj Malhotra...

1016
01:42:09.749 --> 01:42:12.460 line:82%
who had dared
to fall in love with your daughter.

1017
01:42:14.921 --> 01:42:19.968 line:82%
The same Raj Malhotra
whom your daughter loved very much,

1018
01:42:22.288 --> 01:42:23.680 line:82%
The same Raj Malhotra

1019
01:42:24.657 --> 01:42:27.892 line:82%
who you hated so much
that you threw him out of Gurukul

1020
01:42:27.976 --> 01:42:29.575 line:82%
without even seeing his face.

1021
01:42:32.178 --> 01:42:37.861 line:82%
Without meeting him
or giving him a chance to explain.

1022
01:42:40.864 --> 01:42:41.884 line:82%
The same Raj Malhotra

1023
01:42:42.705 --> 01:42:45.384 line:82%
who couldn't get into any university
because of you.

1024
01:42:46.864 --> 01:42:52.705 line:82%
Who could not get a decent job anywhere,
but he stood on his own two feet.

1025
01:42:54.627 --> 01:42:58.798 line:82%
And today, he's been employed by country's
most prestigious educational institution.

1026
01:42:59.132 --> 01:43:03.469 line:82%
Yes...the same man
who promised to destroy me

1027
01:43:04.679 --> 01:43:08.266 line:82%
has welcomed me with open arms.

1028
01:43:11.519 --> 01:43:17.150 line:82%
And as far as my resignation goes,
I am sorry, I cannot.

1029
01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:24.407 line:82%
I have a contract in my hand
which clearly states

1030
01:43:24.699 --> 01:43:26.641 line:82%
that I cannot leave or be expelled

1031
01:43:27.243 --> 01:43:29.996 line:82%
till the end of the term,

1032
01:43:31.164 --> 01:43:35.335 line:82%
signed...Narayan Shankar.

1033
01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:40.497 line:82%
And Mr. Narayan Shankar,
by the time this term is over,

1034
01:43:42.258 --> 01:43:44.974 line:82%
I promise you,
Gurukul will not be the same.

1035
01:43:52.352 --> 01:43:54.812 line:82%
I loved only one woman all my life,

1036
01:43:56.898 --> 01:43:59.197 line:82%
and I will love her forever.

1037
01:44:01.653 --> 01:44:06.157 line:82%
She gave up her life for you,
believing that it would make you kinder,

1038
01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:11.283 line:82%
and bring love into this place
and that everything would change.

1039
01:44:13.665 --> 01:44:16.254 line:82%
You have denied me my only love.

1040
01:44:18.962 --> 01:44:22.681 line:82%
This is a truth
that I will have to live with all my life.

1041
01:44:24.641 --> 01:44:29.305 line:82%
But there is one more truth
that I cannot live with.

1042
01:44:30.598 --> 01:44:34.433 line:82%
And that is the fact
that nothing around here has changed.

1043
01:44:36.187 --> 01:44:40.650 line:82%
That the girl I loved died in vain.

1044
01:44:44.324 --> 01:44:45.997 line:82%
And this, I cannot accept.

1045
01:44:52.829 --> 01:44:58.793 line:82%
I promise you, Mr. Shankar,
by the time I leave,

1046
01:45:00.586 --> 01:45:02.587 line:82%
I will fill this place with so much love

1047
01:45:03.968 --> 01:45:06.596 line:82%
that it will take you ten lifetimes
to remove it.

1048
01:45:09.137 --> 01:45:11.796 line:82%
I will fill this place
with so much sunshine,

1049
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:16.086 line:82%
that the man who has been staring
at the sun for 50 years,

1050
01:45:16.547 --> 01:45:18.703 line:82%
even he will have to lower his eyes.

1051
01:45:21.399 --> 01:45:26.404 line:82%
What happened to us...
will not happen to anyone else.

1052
01:45:34.424 --> 01:45:35.566 line:82%
I can promise you that.

1053
01:45:58.102 --> 01:46:02.852 line:82%
Even if the lovers meet their end

1054
01:46:03.316 --> 01:46:07.940 line:82%
Even if their beloveds perish

1055
01:46:08.446 --> 01:46:13.470 line:82%
Their loves live on, forever

1056
01:47:42.637 --> 01:47:43.791 line:82%
Good morning, Dad.

1057
01:47:50.592 --> 01:47:53.846 line:82%
Today's newspaper and your tea
both are kept next to your chair.

1058
01:47:54.719 --> 01:47:58.181 line:82%
I had made the tea ten minutes ago,
so it's already cold,

1059
01:47:58.306 --> 01:47:59.515 line:82%
just the way you like.

1060
01:48:00.183 --> 01:48:01.778 line:82%
I am leaving early for college today,

1061
01:48:02.018 --> 01:48:04.312 line:82%
but I have told Bahadur
to prepare your breakfast,

1062
01:48:04.395 --> 01:48:07.408 line:82%
and I have also given your clothes
for ironing, and by the way,

1063
01:48:07.517 --> 01:48:10.087 line:82%
today is my birthday,
you can wish me if you want.

1064
01:48:15.323 --> 01:48:16.382 line:82%
I forgot once again.

1065
01:48:19.368 --> 01:48:20.453 line:82%
Come here.

1066
01:48:31.756 --> 01:48:34.258 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1067
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:37.894 line:82%
I must be the world's worst father.

1068
01:48:38.888 --> 01:48:42.225 line:82%
No, not at all. You are
the best father in the world.

1069
01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:48.281 line:82%
Happy birthday, my child.

1070
01:48:49.565 --> 01:48:52.357 line:82%
I pray that you get everything
you ever want,

1071
01:48:53.337 --> 01:48:54.580 line:82%
and all your dreams come true.

1072
01:49:04.378 --> 01:49:07.124 line:82%
Pretty, but still not as beautiful as mom.

1073
01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:08.501 line:82%
Let me see.

1074
01:49:09.046 --> 01:49:12.546 line:82%
Oh, it's you! When did you come?
I was just...

1075
01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:18.094 line:82%
Wait a minute, let me see.

1076
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:31.476 line:82%
I think my daughter
is more beautiful than her mother.

1077
01:49:33.526 --> 01:49:34.628 line:82%
What do you think?

1078
01:49:38.281 --> 01:49:41.867 line:82%
Do you know ever since you were a kid,
you have been wearing

1079
01:49:41.951 --> 01:49:45.663 line:82%
your mother's mangala sutra
and scarf and dressing up as a bride.

1080
01:49:46.664 --> 01:49:52.734 line:82%
I think, now, the time has come
to get you married.

1081
01:49:53.045 --> 01:49:54.521 line:82%
-Stop it, Papa.
-Why?

1082
01:49:57.591 --> 01:50:01.554 line:82%
Hello, Hi. I am busy right now.

1083
01:50:01.637 --> 01:50:04.432 line:82%
I'll call you later. Okay? Bye.

1084
01:50:05.156 --> 01:50:06.173 line:82%
Who was that?

1085
01:50:06.267 --> 01:50:09.136 line:82%
That was Priya.
She keeps calling and boring me.

1086
01:50:09.562 --> 01:50:13.387 line:82%
Now you go change your clothes,
and I will make you some hot coffee.

1087
01:50:14.442 --> 01:50:17.403 line:82%
-Hey. Who's that Priya bothering you?
-Let it go, Papa.

1088
01:50:39.175 --> 01:50:44.540 line:82%
Papa, I have come to apologize to you.

1089
01:50:45.723 --> 01:50:47.367 line:82%
Apologize? For what?

1090
01:50:52.146 --> 01:50:57.568 line:82%
Papa, you always taught me never to lie,

1091
01:50:59.236 --> 01:51:01.030 line:82%
but I lied to you.

1092
01:51:02.865 --> 01:51:07.078 line:82%
That day, when you were in my room
and the phone rang,

1093
01:51:08.245 --> 01:51:13.135 line:82%
I told you it was Priya
but it was not Priya, Papa.

1094
01:51:15.294 --> 01:51:16.310 line:82%
It was someone else.

1095
01:51:17.296 --> 01:51:18.332 line:82%
Who was it?

1096
01:51:21.092 --> 01:51:22.385 line:82%
It was a boy.

1097
01:51:26.972 --> 01:51:29.801 line:82%
A boy whom I have known
for a very long time,

1098
01:51:31.852 --> 01:51:35.775 line:82%
someone who has come to be
more than a friend to me.

1099
01:51:38.776 --> 01:51:42.279 line:82%
A boy who loves me very much.

1100
01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:46.894 line:82%
Someone I also love very much.

1101
01:51:51.015 --> 01:51:55.110 line:82%
I know I should have told you earlier.

1102
01:51:56.919 --> 01:51:59.260 line:82%
But I was scared that you would get angry.

1103
01:52:00.798 --> 01:52:06.720 line:82%
You have always told me
that love leads to pain.

1104
01:52:09.765 --> 01:52:12.601 line:82%
But I do not know what it is about him,

1105
01:52:13.769 --> 01:52:16.555 line:82%
but I just could not stop myself
from walking this path.

1106
01:52:18.607 --> 01:52:24.326 line:82%
When you meet him,
you will realize that how different he is,

1107
01:52:25.531 --> 01:52:29.151 line:82%
how sweet he is, how true he is.

1108
01:52:31.454 --> 01:52:36.375 line:82%
You had prayed
that all my wishes come true,

1109
01:52:37.209 --> 01:52:38.513 line:82%
all my dreams come true.

1110
01:52:41.382 --> 01:52:46.762 line:82%
He is my one and only dream.

1111
01:52:48.637 --> 01:52:51.826 line:82%
-I do not want anything else. I--
-What's his name?

1112
01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:59.460 line:82%
Raj. Raj Malhotra.

1113
01:53:00.608 --> 01:53:01.817 line:82%
What does he do?

1114
01:53:03.903 --> 01:53:07.254 line:82%
He's a student in Gurukul.

1115
01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.610 line:82%
You are not angry, Papa, are you?

1116
01:53:17.041 --> 01:53:18.460 line:82%
Papa, please don't be angry.

1117
01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:26.301 line:82%
I... I love him, Papa, I love him.

1118
01:53:28.482 --> 01:53:29.757 line:82%
I love him, Papa.

1119
01:53:31.058 --> 01:53:32.232 line:82%
I love him.

1120
01:53:59.416 --> 01:54:00.668 line:82%
I am here to inform you

1121
01:54:00.751 --> 01:54:02.896 line:82%
that Raj Malhotra has been expelled
from Gurukul.

1122
01:54:05.089 --> 01:54:09.260 line:82%
I did not meet him,
I do not know what he looks like,

1123
01:54:09.343 --> 01:54:11.291 line:82%
and I hope I never see him.

1124
01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.976 line:82%
I have sent him somewhere
far away from here,

1125
01:54:17.059 --> 01:54:18.700 line:82%
and I would like you to forget him.

1126
01:54:21.313 --> 01:54:24.239 line:82%
I know you must be thinking

1127
01:54:26.193 --> 01:54:29.613 line:82%
that my decision is cruel and wrong,

1128
01:54:29.697 --> 01:54:35.077 line:82%
but I know that this is the best thing

1129
01:54:35.828 --> 01:54:37.442 line:82%
for your future.

1130
01:55:17.828 --> 01:55:19.163 line:82%
Good morning, Papa.

1131
01:55:32.051 --> 01:55:36.138 line:82%
Your tea is over there,
but the newspaper guy has still not come.

1132
01:55:36.587 --> 01:55:39.212 line:82%
It's Sunday,
so I think he is running a little late.

1133
01:55:40.059 --> 01:55:42.603 line:82%
By the way, Bahadur is unwell.

1134
01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:46.062 line:82%
So let me know what you will have
for breakfast, I will make it myself.

1135
01:55:55.699 --> 01:55:56.867 line:82%
Are you all right?

1136
01:55:58.786 --> 01:56:01.954 line:82%
I am absolutely fine, Papa
I am absolutely fine.

1137
01:56:07.419 --> 01:56:10.797 line:82%
Thats enough, it's quite late.

1138
01:56:11.173 --> 01:56:13.989 line:82%
And you have to get up early
in the morning. Open your mouth.

1139
01:56:27.272 --> 01:56:30.492 line:82%
Do you know that
you are the world's best daughter?

1140
01:56:34.321 --> 01:56:35.406 line:82%
Are you happy?

1141
01:56:36.532 --> 01:56:39.172 line:82%
-Are you happy, Papa?
-Very much.

1142
01:56:40.285 --> 01:56:44.566 line:82%
Then I am also very happy.
Good night, Papa.

1143
01:57:21.688 --> 01:57:25.664 line:82%
I'm sorry, Papa.
I tried really hard to forget him.

1144
01:57:26.814 --> 01:57:29.227 line:82%
I tried very hard not to think about him,

1145
01:57:30.252 --> 01:57:34.656 line:82%
to stop loving him...but I just could not.

1146
01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:38.552 line:82%
I love you very much, Papa.

1147
01:57:39.344 --> 01:57:44.499 line:82%
And I can never see you upset,
but I love him, too,

1148
01:57:45.494 --> 01:57:47.274 line:82%
and I cannot live without him.

1149
01:57:50.663 --> 01:57:55.302 line:82%
I hope, someday,
you realize that love is very beautiful,

1150
01:57:56.653 --> 01:58:00.407 line:82%
even if it comes with a little pain.

1151
01:58:03.866 --> 01:58:05.200 line:82%
I am sorry, Papa.

1152
01:58:07.331 --> 01:58:08.332 line:82%
I am sorry.

1153
01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:15.005 line:82%
Megha!

1154
01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:26.451 line:82%
Ever since the day she told me
about you, I have hated you.

1155
01:59:28.537 --> 01:59:33.000 line:82%
I hated you so much
that I never wanted to see your face.

1156
01:59:34.376 --> 01:59:36.086 line:82%
I never ever wanted to hear your voice,

1157
01:59:38.255 --> 01:59:40.941 line:82%
and today you are standing
in front of me on my doorstep.

1158
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:47.055 line:82%
If I wished, I could drag you
out of that gate, and throw you out

1159
01:59:47.571 --> 01:59:52.936 line:82%
and no piece of paper can stop me,
but I am not going to do that.

1160
01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:56.563 line:82%
Because now I want you to stay.

1161
01:59:59.234 --> 02:00:03.864 line:82%
You have given a 55-year-old, tired man

1162
02:00:05.032 --> 02:00:07.075 line:82%
a reason to fight again,

1163
02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:15.876 line:82%
He has to prove all over again that,
for 25 years whatever,

1164
02:00:15.959 --> 02:00:18.579 line:82%
he has stood for and believed in,
still holds true.

1165
02:00:22.466 --> 02:00:24.020 line:82%
You were right about me, Mr. Aryan.

1166
02:00:26.929 --> 02:00:30.432 line:82%
Like you, even I love challenges.

1167
02:00:32.893 --> 02:00:34.556 line:82%
So, now you do what you have to,

1168
02:00:36.438 --> 02:00:39.066 line:82%
and I'll do what I have been doing
for the last 25 years.

1169
02:00:41.693 --> 02:00:43.487 line:82%
The foundation of this structure

1170
02:00:44.363 --> 02:00:48.533 line:82%
is so strong that no Raj Aryan,

1171
02:00:48.617 --> 02:00:52.484 line:82%
with a violin in his hand
and a smile on his face,

1172
02:00:53.455 --> 02:00:56.184 line:82%
will ever dare to walk in here
to change things around.

1173
02:00:58.547 --> 02:00:59.715 line:82%
Never, Mr. Raj Aryan.

1174
02:01:02.255 --> 02:01:03.674 line:82%
Never.

1175
02:01:15.143 --> 02:01:18.814 line:82%
Megha, you were right.

1176
02:01:20.190 --> 02:01:22.487 line:82%
It's not easy to win from your father.

1177
02:01:23.706 --> 02:01:30.589 line:82%
He is one tough man, but we are no less.

1178
02:01:52.921 --> 02:01:57.398 line:82%
Hey, Vicky! Vicky, give it back.
Sameer, I am warning you.

1179
02:02:01.658 --> 02:02:02.691 line:82%
Oh, shit!

1180
02:02:02.774 --> 02:02:04.433 line:82%
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

1181
02:02:04.528 --> 02:02:06.194 line:82%
Do any of you know how to play the piano?

1182
02:02:06.987 --> 02:02:10.657 line:82%
It's okay.
I needed somebody to teach

1183
02:02:10.741 --> 02:02:15.162 line:82%
Major Khanna's grandson, but never mind,
maybe someone else would know.

1184
02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:16.732 line:82%
Cool room.

1185
02:02:19.499 --> 02:02:20.913 line:82%
-Vicky, man.
-Hey, Vicky,

1186
02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:25.391 line:82%
haven't we heard
this name before, Major Khanna.

1187
02:02:26.506 --> 02:02:27.507 line:82%
Oh, shit.

1188
02:02:29.509 --> 02:02:30.527 line:82%
Oh, shit.

1189
02:02:36.975 --> 02:02:39.401 line:82%
So, you would like to learn the piano,
right?

1190
02:02:40.062 --> 02:02:41.081 line:82%
Yes, sir.

1191
02:02:42.773 --> 02:02:43.857 line:82%
Major Khanna.

1192
02:02:44.564 --> 02:02:46.908 line:82%
Come down in 10 minutes,
we have a lot of work to do.

1193
02:02:47.477 --> 02:02:50.489 line:82%
-Yes, sir.
-And do come with some clothes on.

1194
02:03:15.639 --> 02:03:17.808 line:82%
-Well done, Karan.
-Thank you, sir.

1195
02:03:18.225 --> 02:03:22.854 line:82%
Now, Ayush, I want you
to learn to play the piano

1196
02:03:23.605 --> 02:03:25.107 line:82%
before your father comes back.

1197
02:03:25.190 --> 02:03:28.819 line:82%
Do not worry, sir, in one month
he will be playing even better than me.

1198
02:03:29.071 --> 02:03:30.779 line:82%
-Right, Ayush?
-Right.

1199
02:03:31.012 --> 02:03:33.183 line:82%
-Okay, Karan, I am leaving, you carry on.
-Yes, sir.

1200
02:03:33.646 --> 02:03:34.699 line:82%
Right, Ayush?

1201
02:03:34.786 --> 02:03:36.243 line:82%
-Right.
-Good.

1202
02:03:37.804 --> 02:03:39.351 line:82%
Come on, let's start.

1203
02:03:39.438 --> 02:03:44.470 line:82%
Karan, just a minute, this is
our younger daughter-in-law Kiran,

1204
02:03:44.918 --> 02:03:47.552 line:82%
and this is Karan Choudhary,
Ayush's piano teacher.

1205
02:03:48.338 --> 02:03:49.920 line:82%
Hi, nice to meet you.

1206
02:03:50.579 --> 02:03:52.845 line:82%
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

1207
02:03:53.927 --> 02:03:56.096 line:82%
Karan, if you do not mind,

1208
02:03:56.337 --> 02:03:59.266 line:82%
-can you teach her too, along with Ayush?
-Bhabhi!

1209
02:03:59.349 --> 02:04:03.603 line:82%
Hold on, she loves music,
in fact she has learned classical dance.

1210
02:04:03.687 --> 02:04:05.053 line:82%
-Bhabhi.
-Okay.

1211
02:04:05.586 --> 02:04:07.190 line:82%
Okay, she does not do it anymore.

1212
02:04:07.315 --> 02:04:12.362 line:82%
Thank God she doesn't, otherwise
she used to disturb me every morning.

1213
02:04:12.445 --> 02:04:14.197 line:82%
-Ayush, stop it.
-You stop it.

1214
02:04:18.076 --> 02:04:19.121 line:82%
All the best.

1215
02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.540 line:82%
Okay. Time out.
Ayush, get me a glass of water.

1216
02:04:23.832 --> 02:04:24.886 line:82%
Sister, get water.

1217
02:04:25.584 --> 02:04:29.295 line:82%
Ayush, this is wrong, your sister is elder
than you, you go and get me water.

1218
02:04:29.838 --> 02:04:31.840 line:82%
Okay. In this house
I have to do all the work.

1219
02:04:31.923 --> 02:04:32.924 line:82%
Shut up.

1220
02:04:33.842 --> 02:04:35.427 line:82%
Ramu kaka, water!

1221
02:04:36.887 --> 02:04:39.332 line:82%
You never told me that you used to dance?

1222
02:04:39.973 --> 02:04:46.188 line:82%
What is there to say in that?
Anyway, I used to dance, I do not anymore.

1223
02:04:46.938 --> 02:04:48.028 line:82%
Why?

1224
02:04:48.648 --> 02:04:52.101 line:82%
-You ask too many questions.
-That's because you never answer.

1225
02:04:53.111 --> 02:04:56.035 line:82%
Have you come here to teach Ayush
piano lessons or to chat with me?

1226
02:04:58.241 --> 02:04:59.284 line:82%
What do you think?

1227
02:05:11.421 --> 02:05:16.887 line:82%
Ishika, my child, meet your new dance
partner Vikram, not Viren, right?

1228
02:05:17.177 --> 02:05:18.178 line:82%
Right.

1229
02:05:18.678 --> 02:05:22.098 line:82%
Okay, Vikram, I want you know
that this dance competition

1230
02:05:22.174 --> 02:05:24.925 line:82%
is a matter of prestige for our college,

1231
02:05:25.602 --> 02:05:31.035 line:82%
and that is why, on my request,
Mr. Raj Aryan has sent you to help us out.

1232
02:05:31.441 --> 02:05:33.946 line:82%
What a wonderful man he is. God bless him.

1233
02:05:34.611 --> 02:05:38.371 line:82%
Ishika, I want you both
to befriend each other

1234
02:05:38.907 --> 02:05:42.318 line:82%
and in a month's time,
show me something really special.

1235
02:05:42.911 --> 02:05:44.037 line:82%
-Okay?
-Yes, ma'am.

1236
02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:46.957 line:82%
-But no fighting. Okay?
- -Yes, ma'am.

1237
02:05:50.795 --> 02:05:54.632 line:82%
Don't make your already stupid face
look even more stupid.

1238
02:05:55.674 --> 02:06:00.350 line:82%
In case you don't know, I've won this
dance competition for three years running,

1239
02:06:01.179 --> 02:06:05.091 line:82%
and I am not going to end up losing
this year because of an idiot like you.

1240
02:06:06.017 --> 02:06:10.438 line:82%
So if you do not wish to make
a fool of yourself, just leave quietly.

1241
02:06:10.522 --> 02:06:14.567 line:82%
No, please, don't do that.
I have been waiting for this all my life.

1242
02:06:14.818 --> 02:06:19.216 line:82%
All I have ever wanted is to be able
to dance with you. That's it.

1243
02:06:19.572 --> 02:06:25.078 line:82%
After this, even if I die I will have
no regrets. Please dance with me.

1244
02:06:25.726 --> 02:06:27.281 line:82%
Please!

1245
02:06:27.902 --> 02:06:32.666 line:82%
Your sense of humor is just like you,
sick and disgusting.

1246
02:06:33.187 --> 02:06:34.204 line:82%
Hey, Ishq.

1247
02:06:34.379 --> 02:06:39.050 line:82%
-My name is lshika!
-My friends feel that I was rude

1248
02:06:39.301 --> 02:06:42.804 line:82%
to you the other day,
when you had come to apologize.

1249
02:06:43.573 --> 02:06:49.019 line:82%
-And what do you feel?
-I think they are right. I am sorry.

1250
02:06:50.145 --> 02:06:51.988 line:82%
-It's okay.
-Friends?

1251
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:54.649 line:82%
-Friends.
-Cool.

1252
02:06:54.983 --> 02:06:56.318 line:82%
Now, can you let me go?

1253
02:06:57.385 --> 02:06:58.674 line:82%
I don't feel like it.

1254
02:06:59.529 --> 02:07:01.990 line:82%
Oh? Do you feel like getting a slap?

1255
02:07:03.658 --> 02:07:04.701 line:82%
Sure.

1256
02:07:06.473 --> 02:07:08.204 line:82%
-If the girl smiles, she's yours.
-What?

1257
02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:09.831 line:82%
Nothing.

1258
02:07:10.415 --> 02:07:13.321 line:82%
-Okay, let me go.
-Let you go?

1259
02:07:13.918 --> 02:07:14.961 line:82%
Please.

1260
02:07:16.421 --> 02:07:17.547 line:82%
Okay.

1261
02:07:17.988 --> 02:07:19.024 line:82%
Stupid.

1262
02:07:20.175 --> 02:07:21.176 line:82%
I love her.

1263
02:07:57.128 --> 02:07:59.433 line:82%
-Mr. Aryan, you didn't join us?
-I am just...

1264
02:08:01.925 --> 02:08:03.343 line:82%
-Hi, how are you?
-Morning, sir.

1265
02:08:03.426 --> 02:08:05.178 line:82%
Come, come,
I need to talk to you guys.

1266
02:08:05.261 --> 02:08:06.304 line:82%
Mr. Raj Aryan.

1267
02:08:09.224 --> 02:08:10.595 line:82%
-You guys carry on.
-Yes, sir.

1268
02:08:16.898 --> 02:08:19.585 line:82%
I would like to remind you
that till you are a part of Gurukul,

1269
02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:23.029 line:82%
it is your duty to follow
the traditions of this place.

1270
02:08:23.988 --> 02:08:27.634 line:82%
Next time, I do not want to see you
outside the temple.

1271
02:08:28.451 --> 02:08:31.700 line:82%
I'm sorry, sir,
but I will not come into the temple.

1272
02:08:34.124 --> 02:08:36.061 line:82%
I have an old score to settle with him,

1273
02:08:36.835 --> 02:08:40.839 line:82%
he took the one person
who believed in him the most.

1274
02:08:42.465 --> 02:08:44.509 line:82%
Challenging us mortals
was not enough for you,

1275
02:08:44.592 --> 02:08:46.153 line:82%
that you have decided to take on God.

1276
02:08:46.594 --> 02:08:49.872 line:82%
No, sir, my God is within me.

1277
02:08:52.725 --> 02:08:54.294 line:82%
I do not believe in any other God.

1278
02:08:57.397 --> 02:08:58.857 line:82%
Mr. Raj Aryan...

1279
02:09:03.528 --> 02:09:07.449 line:82%
Take this, prasad, for all your battles.

1280
02:09:08.575 --> 02:09:11.536 line:82%
I'm sorry, sir,
but I cannot take even this.

1281
02:09:12.704 --> 02:09:16.916 line:82%
Because to take this, I would have
to touch your feet, like the others.

1282
02:09:18.126 --> 02:09:20.628 line:82%
And that is something
that my heart will not allow me to do.

1283
02:09:20.712 --> 02:09:23.339 line:82%
I do not force anyone to touch my feet,
Mr. Aryan.

1284
02:09:24.424 --> 02:09:27.677 line:82%
They do it out of respect.

1285
02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:33.224 line:82%
They touch your feet out of fear
and you mistake their fear for respect.

1286
02:09:34.135 --> 02:09:35.179 line:82%
But I'm...

1287
02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:38.813 line:82%
But you are not scared of me, Mr. Aryan.
I know that...

1288
02:09:41.232 --> 02:09:43.483 line:82%
The other day you had put the tilaka
on my forehead,

1289
02:09:44.694 --> 02:09:47.405 line:82%
but I had nothing to give you.

1290
02:09:49.199 --> 02:09:51.913 line:82%
Today, accept this as a blessing
for that day,

1291
02:09:53.578 --> 02:09:55.218 line:82%
it would relieve a burden from my head,

1292
02:09:56.456 --> 02:09:59.054 line:82%
and make us even.

1293
02:10:00.502 --> 02:10:01.521 line:82%
And yes,

1294
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:05.003 line:82%
you do not have to touch my feet.

1295
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:10.053 line:82%
Okay, sir, if this is just about
clearing debts,

1296
02:10:11.679 --> 02:10:13.389 line:82%
then I accept.

1297
02:10:16.893 --> 02:10:19.979 line:82%
-Best of luck, Mr. Aryan.
-You too, sir.

1298
02:10:56.683 --> 02:10:58.761 line:82%
Sameer! What are you doing here?

1299
02:10:59.118 --> 02:11:00.311 line:82%
Working, what else?

1300
02:11:00.495 --> 02:11:02.783 line:82%
For the opportunity to earn 500 rupees
on a Sunday

1301
02:11:03.398 --> 02:11:05.525 line:82%
and to get to see
a Singhania party for free,

1302
02:11:05.608 --> 02:11:07.860 line:82%
only a fool can refuse such an offer.

1303
02:11:07.944 --> 02:11:10.572 line:82%
I don't believe you, anyway,
it's great that I found you,

1304
02:11:10.655 --> 02:11:11.781 line:82%
now just stay with me.

1305
02:11:11.864 --> 02:11:13.888 line:82%
Sanjana, leave my hand,
it does not look good.

1306
02:11:13.981 --> 02:11:17.083 line:82%
I'm supposed to be working.
This is your boyfriend's party,

1307
02:11:17.323 --> 02:11:18.621 line:82%
so you must know everyone.

1308
02:11:18.701 --> 02:11:21.958 line:82%
I don't. These are all
Deepak's friends. I don't know them.

1309
02:11:22.041 --> 02:11:24.517 line:82%
Sorry, but I don't want
to get fired because of you. Okay?

1310
02:11:24.593 --> 02:11:27.399 line:82%
-Sameer!
-Hey, Sanjana. How you are doing, babes?

1311
02:11:28.241 --> 02:11:30.466 line:82%
Let me introduce you.
Where have you been?

1312
02:11:30.542 --> 02:11:33.052 line:82%
-I'll come in a bit, Deepak.
-What do you mean "In a bit"?

1313
02:11:33.136 --> 02:11:35.271 line:82%
What are you doing?
Don't embarrass me. Put me down.

1314
02:11:35.357 --> 02:11:37.056 line:82%
Deepak, what are you doing?
Put me down.

1315
02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:39.482 line:82%
Sanjana, come on, you want to get
into the pool right now?

1316
02:11:39.855 --> 02:11:42.109 line:82%
-Deepak. No!
-And here we go!

1317
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:51.070 line:82%
Yeah.

1318
02:11:53.281 --> 02:11:54.866 line:82%
Go, Sanjana.

1319
02:11:57.605 --> 02:11:58.852 line:82%
Guys, relax.

1320
02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:07.617 line:82%
Come on, Sanjana, don't cry.
I was just kidding.

1321
02:12:08.463 --> 02:12:11.674 line:82%
I'm sorry, okay?
Come on, give me your hand, come on.

1322
02:12:11.799 --> 02:12:12.884 line:82%
Deepak.

1323
02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:52.135 line:82%
Listen, Sanjana I'm sorry, okay.
I should not have done that.

1324
02:12:53.174 --> 02:12:55.510 line:82%
Enough, Deepak, enough.

1325
02:13:01.863 --> 02:13:04.143 line:82%
One, two, three, four and turn.

1326
02:13:19.951 --> 02:13:21.285 line:82%
All guys are alike.

1327
02:13:21.953 --> 02:13:23.037 line:82%
You said something?

1328
02:13:24.205 --> 02:13:26.165 line:82%
You know, you boys are so stupid.

1329
02:13:26.958 --> 02:13:30.101 line:82%
It's so easy for any girl
to draw your attention.

1330
02:13:31.129 --> 02:13:34.055 line:82%
All she needs to do is dress
suggestively like our dear friend, Sonia,

1331
02:13:34.417 --> 02:13:37.148 line:82%
and she's got you all
wrapped around her little finger.

1332
02:13:39.053 --> 02:13:40.870 line:82%
That's all you boys ever think of, right?

1333
02:13:41.305 --> 02:13:44.434 line:82%
You never think of what kind of person
she is, what is in her heart,

1334
02:13:44.517 --> 02:13:47.311 line:82%
how she talks, right?

1335
02:13:47.843 --> 02:13:50.955 line:82%
You're right,
we never think of such things, never.

1336
02:13:53.735 --> 02:13:54.944 line:82%
You're disgusting.

1337
02:13:56.946 --> 02:14:01.272 line:82%
Do you know what your problem is?
You are jealous of Sonia.

1338
02:14:02.410 --> 02:14:04.662 line:82%
Me? Jealous of Sonia?

1339
02:14:04.746 --> 02:14:07.812 line:82%
Yes. Because basically you want
to be just like Sonia,

1340
02:14:08.291 --> 02:14:10.379 line:82%
but you know that is impossible.
Let's face it,

1341
02:14:10.998 --> 02:14:15.310 line:82%
you do not have what it takes,
and that makes you hate her even more.

1342
02:14:15.923 --> 02:14:19.761 line:82%
I think you have a big complex
and you should deal with it.

1343
02:14:20.762 --> 02:14:21.971 line:82%
Think about it.

1344
02:14:23.306 --> 02:14:27.725 line:82%
Listen, Mr Vikram Oberoi, neither am I
jealous, nor do I hate anyone.

1345
02:14:28.186 --> 02:14:31.989 line:82%
I am very happy the way I am.
As for your Sonia,

1346
02:14:32.732 --> 02:14:34.984 line:82%
I can be like her anytime, if I want to.

1347
02:14:35.067 --> 02:14:39.030 line:82%
But she can never be like me ever,
understand?

1348
02:14:39.113 --> 02:14:41.866 line:82%
Believe me, lshika,
you can never look like Sonia.

1349
02:14:42.241 --> 02:14:43.708 line:82%
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

1350
02:14:43.977 --> 02:14:47.315 line:82%
-Yes, I can!
-No, you can't

1351
02:14:47.413 --> 02:14:50.900 line:82%
Vicky, I am not getting this dance step.

1352
02:14:51.501 --> 02:14:53.945 line:82%
Do help me, please.

1353
02:14:54.005 --> 02:14:57.465 line:82%
Sure, of course. If you ever have
any problems, just come to Vicky.

1354
02:15:09.310 --> 02:15:12.438 line:82%
Why are you not ready yet?
We have to go to Mr. Sharma's house.

1355
02:15:12.522 --> 02:15:14.742 line:82%
I do not feel like going.

1356
02:15:15.566 --> 02:15:16.667 line:82%
Every time the same excuse.

1357
02:15:18.408 --> 02:15:21.309 line:82%
Listen, sometimes it is good to go out,

1358
02:15:21.739 --> 02:15:23.658 line:82%
to meet people, to make friends.

1359
02:15:24.742 --> 02:15:27.274 line:82%
You cannot shut yourself
from the world forever, can you?

1360
02:15:30.816 --> 02:15:33.543 line:82%
Okay, take your time.

1361
02:15:36.879 --> 02:15:39.480 line:82%
We will be late.
Make sure that Ayush sleeps on time.

1362
02:15:39.557 --> 02:15:41.092 line:82%
And no MTV or Zee TV for him.

1363
02:15:41.509 --> 02:15:42.838 line:82%
-Okay, Sis.
-Bye.

1364
02:16:02.488 --> 02:16:06.784 line:82%
A small gift, for a girl
who is incomplete without this.

1365
02:16:10.544 --> 02:16:14.417 line:82%
What happened? You did not like the gift.

1366
02:16:14.792 --> 02:16:17.403 line:82%
You, what are you doing here?
Have you gone mad?

1367
02:16:17.703 --> 02:16:19.685 line:82%
do you know what will happen
if you're caught?

1368
02:16:19.765 --> 02:16:21.173 line:82%
Relax, no one has seen me.

1369
02:16:21.450 --> 02:16:23.017 line:82%
I don't know anything, just go.

1370
02:16:23.097 --> 02:16:26.260 line:82%
Okay, okay, I will go on one condition.

1371
02:16:26.512 --> 02:16:27.555 line:82%
What?

1372
02:16:27.638 --> 02:16:30.191 line:82%
I want to see you dance
wearing these ankle-bells, just once.

1373
02:16:30.925 --> 02:16:33.768 line:82%
-I cannot do it.
-Hey, you can't say no.

1374
02:16:34.769 --> 02:16:36.230 line:82%
It's the first rule of friendship.

1375
02:16:36.606 --> 02:16:39.358 line:82%
You can never say no
to anything that a friend asks for.

1376
02:16:39.451 --> 02:16:41.554 line:82%
-Karan, stop it. I'm very scared.
-Nandini.

1377
02:16:42.745 --> 02:16:44.922 line:82%
Nandini, hurry up, we are getting late.

1378
02:16:45.022 --> 02:16:46.669 line:82%
Yes, Father, I am downstairs.

1379
02:16:47.323 --> 02:16:49.174 line:82%
Karan, you please go from here.

1380
02:16:49.493 --> 02:16:50.522 line:82%
First promise me.

1381
02:16:51.233 --> 02:16:53.083 line:82%
I do not know how to dance.

1382
02:16:53.456 --> 02:16:56.286 line:82%
I used to do it before,
but now I have forgotten.

1383
02:16:56.667 --> 02:16:57.960 line:82%
Listen,

1384
02:16:59.337 --> 02:17:05.009 line:82%
I wanted to make my friend happy,
so I got her a gift.

1385
02:17:06.052 --> 02:17:09.847 line:82%
Now, if you feel like making
your friend happy,

1386
02:17:10.848 --> 02:17:14.923 line:82%
then come to the terrace wearing
those ankle-bells, it's as simple as that.

1387
02:17:19.023 --> 02:17:21.150 line:82%
Why are you doing all this, Karan?

1388
02:17:23.569 --> 02:17:26.982 line:82%
Because there is this friend
of mine who is scared to be happy,

1389
02:17:27.949 --> 02:17:32.745 line:82%
I want to show her how easy it is,
to be happy.

1390
02:17:47.802 --> 02:17:49.262 line:82%
Why did this happen, Sameer?

1391
02:17:51.222 --> 02:17:53.224 line:82%
How could I make such a big mistake?

1392
02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:57.525 line:82%
Do you really want to know?

1393
02:18:16.205 --> 02:18:19.928 line:82%
This was your mistake,
this is not Sanjana,

1394
02:18:21.002 --> 02:18:22.086 line:82%
this is someone else.

1395
02:18:23.504 --> 02:18:24.588 line:82%
One minute.

1396
02:18:51.143 --> 02:18:56.084 line:82%
This is my Sanju,
clumsy, messy, cute, boyish.

1397
02:18:58.039 --> 02:19:00.258 line:82%
You'd forgotten yourself,
when you were with Deepak.

1398
02:19:01.375 --> 02:19:07.131 line:82%
You had become the way he wanted
to see you. This was your mistake.

1399
02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:21.031 line:82%
If one must love, let them love you.

1400
02:19:23.689 --> 02:19:26.705 line:82%
The way you are,
let them love you for that.

1401
02:19:28.486 --> 02:19:30.304 line:82%
If someone tries to change you
to love you,

1402
02:19:31.614 --> 02:19:34.745 line:82%
then it is not love, but a business deal.

1403
02:19:36.994 --> 02:19:40.691 line:82%
And darling, there is no room
for business in love.

1404
02:19:42.522 --> 02:19:45.437 line:82%
You forgot your own rule.

1405
02:19:51.509 --> 02:19:52.510 line:82%
Let's go.

1406
02:19:58.390 --> 02:19:59.665 line:82%
Sameer,

1407
02:20:01.227 --> 02:20:03.313 line:82%
take me in your arms.

1408
02:20:06.065 --> 02:20:07.108 line:82%
Please.

1409
02:20:08.943 --> 02:20:10.778 line:82%
Yes. Sure.

1410
02:20:14.115 --> 02:20:15.282 line:82%
Thank you.

1411
02:20:16.492 --> 02:20:18.881 line:82%
Thank you, Sameer,
for being my best friend.

1412
02:28:28.553 --> 02:28:31.556 line:82%
You won.

1413
02:28:32.571 --> 02:28:36.110 line:82%
Their love stories have begun, you won.

1414
02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:38.228 line:82%
We won.

1415
02:29:08.982 --> 02:29:12.819 line:82%
Come, steal me from myself

1416
02:29:14.556 --> 02:29:19.284 line:82%
Hide me somewhere in your heart

1417
02:29:20.243 --> 02:29:25.040 line:82%
Come, steal me from myself

1418
02:29:25.893 --> 02:29:30.363 line:82%
Hide me somewhere in your heart

1419
02:29:30.712 --> 02:29:35.342 line:82%
Don't let me get lost in loneliness

1420
02:29:36.551 --> 02:29:40.681 line:82%
Don't let me lose you

1421
02:29:42.065 --> 02:29:46.784 line:82%
Come to me, take me in your arms

1422
02:29:48.355 --> 02:29:52.578 line:82%
Come, steal me from myself

1423
02:29:54.037 --> 02:29:58.541 line:82%
Hide me somewhere in your heart

1424
02:29:58.783 --> 02:30:03.161 line:82%
Don't let me get lost in loneliness

1425
02:30:04.733 --> 02:30:09.644 line:82%
Don't let me lose you

1426
02:30:10.293 --> 02:30:15.006 line:82%
Come to me, take me in your arms

1427
02:30:16.555 --> 02:30:21.398 line:82%
Come, steal me from myself

1428
02:30:22.139 --> 02:30:26.476 line:82%
Hide me somewhere in your heart

1429
02:31:12.397 --> 02:31:16.151 line:82%
Make my heart beat faster

1430
02:31:17.986 --> 02:31:22.449 line:82%
Let your hair spread out

1431
02:31:23.548 --> 02:31:28.693 line:82%
With your customary coyness

1432
02:31:29.164 --> 02:31:33.511 line:82%
Let the wind catch your veil

1433
02:31:33.919 --> 02:31:39.481 line:82%
What if, on spreading my hair
Night consumes the day

1434
02:31:39.571 --> 02:31:45.013 line:82%
l could let my veil wave with the wind
But what if it brings the rain?

1435
02:31:45.222 --> 02:31:50.235 line:82%
Let it pour

1436
02:31:50.887 --> 02:31:55.774 line:82%
We have something to talk about

1437
02:31:56.608 --> 02:32:01.112 line:82%
Come to me, take me in your arms

1438
02:32:02.823 --> 02:32:06.451 line:82%
Come, steal me from myself

1439
02:32:08.411 --> 02:32:12.969 line:82%
Hide me somewhere in your heart

1440
02:32:13.416 --> 02:32:18.465 line:82%
Don't let me get lost in loneliness

1441
02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:23.635 line:82%
Don't let me lose you

1442
02:32:24.719 --> 02:32:29.057 line:82%
Come to me, take me in your arms

1443
02:32:30.976 --> 02:32:35.230 line:82%
Come, steal me from myself

1444
02:32:36.613 --> 02:32:40.433 line:82%
Hide me somewhere in your heart

1445
02:33:43.965 --> 02:33:47.844 line:82%
l could die for you

1446
02:33:49.554 --> 02:33:53.808 line:82%
I'm going to die

1447
02:33:54.976 --> 02:34:00.174 line:82%
Everyone says this

1448
02:34:00.649 --> 02:34:04.871 line:82%
But I'll be the one to do it

1449
02:34:05.487 --> 02:34:08.198 line:82%
Put a little vermilion

1450
02:34:08.281 --> 02:34:11.076 line:82%
On my forehead

1451
02:34:11.159 --> 02:34:13.745 line:82%
Who has seen tomorrow?

1452
02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:16.706 line:82%
Do it all, today, now

1453
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:21.894 line:82%
Whether or not everyone agrees

1454
02:34:22.379 --> 02:34:24.464 line:82%
If our hearts are convinced

1455
02:34:25.173 --> 02:34:27.759 line:82%
The Lord will approve

1456
02:34:28.093 --> 02:34:32.597 line:82%
Come to me, take me in your arms

1457
02:34:34.015 --> 02:34:38.144 line:82%
Come, steal me from myself

1458
02:34:40.021 --> 02:34:44.234 line:82%
Hide me somewhere in your heart

1459
02:34:45.735 --> 02:34:49.614 line:82%
Come, steal me from myself

1460
02:34:51.197 --> 02:34:55.078 line:82%
Hide me somewhere in your heart

1461
02:34:56.204 --> 02:35:00.917 line:82%
Don't let me get lost in loneliness

1462
02:35:01.668 --> 02:35:06.506 line:82%
Don't let me lose you

1463
02:35:07.507 --> 02:35:12.836 line:82%
Come to me, take me in your arms

1464
02:35:13.221 --> 02:35:18.236 line:82%
Come to me, take me in your arms

1465
02:36:51.611 --> 02:36:52.616 line:82%
What is your name?

1466
02:36:53.947 --> 02:36:56.374 line:82%
Vikram, sir.

1467
02:36:58.034 --> 02:37:02.048 line:82%
-Are you aware of the rules of Gurukul?
-Yes, sir.

1468
02:37:03.123 --> 02:37:05.792 line:82%
So you know that you have broken
one of the rules,

1469
02:37:07.418 --> 02:37:09.616 line:82%
and that you can be expelled for it.

1470
02:37:11.087 --> 02:37:12.090 line:82%
Yes, sir.

1471
02:37:12.966 --> 02:37:17.570 line:82%
So tell me, Vikram,
what is the reason for your carelessness?

1472
02:37:18.471 --> 02:37:20.543 line:82%
Sir, I was, I was...

1473
02:37:25.186 --> 02:37:27.772 line:82%
Vicky! Vicky!

1474
02:37:34.028 --> 02:37:36.193 line:82%
Hey, Vicky.
Did you reach the station on time?

1475
02:37:37.676 --> 02:37:38.741 line:82%
Station, sir?

1476
02:37:39.242 --> 02:37:42.662 line:82%
The parcel that I gave you,
did the station master accept it?

1477
02:37:43.653 --> 02:37:48.251 line:82%
Parcel? Yes, sir. The station master
accepted your parcel, sir.

1478
02:37:49.002 --> 02:37:53.859 line:82%
Great. It's very late, you go to bed.
And Vicky, thank you very much.

1479
02:37:54.465 --> 02:37:55.592 line:82%
My pleasure, sir.

1480
02:37:56.843 --> 02:37:57.886 line:82%
Good night, sir.

1481
02:38:13.401 --> 02:38:17.980 line:82%
It's very late, sir. You should also
go to sleep, otherwise for the first time,

1482
02:38:18.535 --> 02:38:21.451 line:82%
the sun will rise before you do.
Good night.

1483
02:38:45.391 --> 02:38:47.518 line:82%
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, Rushad.

1484
02:38:47.770 --> 02:38:51.606 line:82%
Hey, Karan, why is there
a sudden assembly being held on Tuesday?

1485
02:38:51.724 --> 02:38:52.874 line:82%
-No idea, man.
-Hey, guys.

1486
02:38:53.608 --> 02:38:56.277 line:82%
Hey, Vicky, not bad.
Only five minutes late.

1487
02:38:56.361 --> 02:38:57.856 line:82%
I'm trying, man. I'm trying my best.

1488
02:39:13.544 --> 02:39:15.588 line:82%
I have called all of you here, today,

1489
02:39:15.672 --> 02:39:17.882 line:82%
because I have found out
that a few students

1490
02:39:17.966 --> 02:39:19.947 line:82%
are trying
to break the discipline of Gurukul.

1491
02:39:22.328 --> 02:39:26.347 line:82%
Some students are leaving the campus
regularly and not returning on time.

1492
02:39:29.686 --> 02:39:34.691 line:82%
I would like to remind them and everyone
else that breaking the rules of Gurukul

1493
02:39:34.774 --> 02:39:37.177 line:82%
will not be tolerated at any cost.

1494
02:39:40.919 --> 02:39:46.369 line:82%
I think my silence has been misunderstood
to be my weakness by some of you.

1495
02:39:49.706 --> 02:39:52.168 line:82%
So from today, the Gurukul gate
will be shut at all times.

1496
02:39:53.876 --> 02:39:57.119 line:82%
From now on,no one will leave the campus,
under any circumstance.

1497
02:39:58.631 --> 02:40:04.053 line:82%
Anyone caught will be
expelled immediately. I repeat,

1498
02:40:06.347 --> 02:40:09.475 line:82%
anyone caught will be

1499
02:40:09.559 --> 02:40:12.668 line:82%
expelled immediately.

1500
02:40:14.981 --> 02:40:16.004 line:82%
You all can go now.

1501
02:40:41.299 --> 02:40:42.675 line:82%
Mr. Aryan,

1502
02:40:45.386 --> 02:40:51.835 line:82%
I know everything that goes on in Gurukul.

1503
02:40:54.103 --> 02:40:56.189 line:82%
Nothing escapes my eyes.

1504
02:40:58.358 --> 02:41:01.235 line:82%
Those three boys
will have to stop going out.

1505
02:41:03.363 --> 02:41:05.490 line:82%
There will be no part-time job,

1506
02:41:06.616 --> 02:41:09.619 line:82%
no piano-playing, and no dancing.

1507
02:41:12.663 --> 02:41:15.666 line:82%
I would like you to be the one
to break this news to them.

1508
02:41:21.506 --> 02:41:22.590 line:82%
Yes, sir.

1509
02:41:23.753 --> 02:41:24.759 line:82%
Thank you, Mr. Aryan.

1510
02:41:49.033 --> 02:41:51.911 line:82%
It's nice to see you smiling, Mr. Shankar.

1511
02:41:54.664 --> 02:41:56.206 line:82%
It must be a very special morning.

1512
02:41:57.583 --> 02:41:58.793 line:82%
Definitely, Mr. Aryan.

1513
02:42:00.294 --> 02:42:01.538 line:82%
Do you see these winds?

1514
02:42:03.214 --> 02:42:04.674 line:82%
These are the winds of Gurukul.

1515
02:42:04.757 --> 02:42:06.653 line:82%
For years they've been blowing
from East.

1516
02:42:08.386 --> 02:42:13.224 line:82%
A few days ago,
they'd begun to blow from the West.

1517
02:42:15.435 --> 02:42:16.462 line:82%
But now,

1518
02:42:18.146 --> 02:42:20.304 line:82%
they are back to normal.

1519
02:42:22.942 --> 02:42:26.185 line:82%
Today, everything is back to normal,
Mr. Aryan.

1520
02:42:28.948 --> 02:42:30.450 line:82%
It is a very special morning.

1521
02:42:30.867 --> 02:42:34.638 line:82%
Congratulations, Mr. Shankar,
even the winds are scared of you.

1522
02:42:35.288 --> 02:42:37.861 line:82%
Maybe even they know
that you do not like changes.

1523
02:42:39.208 --> 02:42:41.961 line:82%
It just shows the power of your fear.

1524
02:42:44.839 --> 02:42:48.268 line:82%
You were the one who made me aware
of the power of my fear, Mr. Aryan.

1525
02:42:51.262 --> 02:42:53.686 line:82%
You were the one who told me
that everyone is scared of me,

1526
02:42:54.932 --> 02:42:57.548 line:82%
that they love you, and fear me, right?

1527
02:42:59.687 --> 02:43:01.525 line:82%
But I want you to know something,
Mr. Aryan.

1528
02:43:03.194 --> 02:43:08.419 line:82%
That in the battle of love and fear,
fear will always win.

1529
02:43:08.738 --> 02:43:10.101 line:82%
No, Mr. Shankar.

1530
02:43:12.617 --> 02:43:14.634 line:82%
Till now you have only seen
the power of fear.

1531
02:43:16.162 --> 02:43:18.289 line:82%
You have not even seen
what power love can wield.

1532
02:43:19.665 --> 02:43:23.686 line:82%
Love, if it so wishes,
can crumble all the bricks

1533
02:43:24.269 --> 02:43:26.631 line:82%
of this building
with just this single leaf.

1534
02:43:29.884 --> 02:43:32.303 line:82%
I would like to see such power, Mr. Aryan.

1535
02:43:37.930 --> 02:43:39.357 line:82%
I'd really like to see that happen.

1536
02:43:43.525 --> 02:43:48.819 line:82%
Now, you'll definitely see
the power of love. You definitely will.

1537
02:44:08.881 --> 02:44:11.092 line:82%
-Good morning, boys.
-Good morning, sir.

1538
02:44:11.187 --> 02:44:15.137 line:82%
Today is 14th February, Valentines Day,
the day of love.

1539
02:44:16.137 --> 02:44:19.684 line:82%
Today, I am going to begin
by telling you a love story.

1540
02:44:20.768 --> 02:44:25.314 line:82%
A story of a boy, a girl and a leaf.

1541
02:44:26.065 --> 02:44:28.609 line:82%
It is a story of a boy from Gurukul,
like you,

1542
02:44:28.734 --> 02:44:31.700 line:82%
the only difference was, he was in love.

1543
02:44:32.697 --> 02:44:34.621 line:82%
And he had decided that on this day,

1544
02:44:35.575 --> 02:44:38.215 line:82%
he would tell her everything,

1545
02:44:40.121 --> 02:44:41.623 line:82%
No matter what.

1546
02:44:45.251 --> 02:44:47.753 line:82%
She was standing at the bus stop
with her friends,

1547
02:44:47.837 --> 02:44:50.131 line:82%
waiting to leave for the college picnic.

1548
02:44:50.923 --> 02:44:53.586 line:82%
The boy snuck out of Gurukul
and came running to see her.

1549
02:44:54.719 --> 02:44:56.762 line:82%
He saw her getting into the bus.

1550
02:44:57.096 --> 02:44:59.515 line:82%
He immediately
took out a pen from his pocket

1551
02:44:59.599 --> 02:45:01.559 line:82%
and tried to find some paper.

1552
02:45:02.435 --> 02:45:05.053 line:82%
Then he picked up a leaf
from the ground and wrote on it.

1553
02:45:05.605 --> 02:45:10.276 line:82%
"Dear Megha, I love you."
He gave it to a kid on the street

1554
02:45:10.401 --> 02:45:11.824 line:82%
and pointed towards the girl.

1555
02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:14.447 line:82%
The kid ran towards the girl,

1556
02:45:14.530 --> 02:45:16.152 line:82%
who was just about to enter the bus.

1557
02:45:17.158 --> 02:45:20.326 line:82%
Just then, there was a convoy of army
trucks which blocked his view,

1558
02:45:20.594 --> 02:45:22.607 line:82%
and he couldn't see the girl for a while.

1559
02:45:23.623 --> 02:45:26.605 line:82%
Calming himself
he kept looking in her direction.

1560
02:45:27.209 --> 02:45:30.588 line:82%
As the last truck passed, he saw that
all the girls were in the bus.

1561
02:45:33.257 --> 02:45:36.594 line:82%
Looking around, he saw the kid
hand the same leaf to him.

1562
02:45:37.261 --> 02:45:39.116 line:82%
Something was written
on the other side,

1563
02:45:39.764 --> 02:45:42.225 line:82%
"I have waited
so long to hear this. Megha."

1564
02:45:43.976 --> 02:45:45.645 line:82%
By that time,
the bus had already left.

1565
02:45:45.728 --> 02:45:48.536 line:82%
He ran behind the bus like a lunatic.
But the bus had left.

1566
02:45:49.398 --> 02:45:51.442 line:82%
He stood there in the middle of the road.

1567
02:45:54.570 --> 02:45:58.366 line:82%
He turned, only to see her
standing in front of him.

1568
02:46:42.326 --> 02:46:44.402 line:82%
So this was a true love story

1569
02:46:45.788 --> 02:46:50.075 line:82%
that happened on Valentines Day.

1570
02:46:52.044 --> 02:46:53.212 line:82%
Sir, what happened next?

1571
02:46:53.295 --> 02:46:57.252 line:82%
Then, they got married and they lived
happily ever after, right, sir?

1572
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:05.850 line:82%
Wrong. What happened next, you all know.

1573
02:47:07.601 --> 02:47:10.020 line:82%
Because this is the story
of the one and only student

1574
02:47:10.604 --> 02:47:12.453 line:82%
who was thrown out of Gurukul.

1575
02:47:13.149 --> 02:47:17.653 line:82%
The one who some of you call
the crazy lover.

1576
02:47:18.946 --> 02:47:22.033 line:82%
Was he crazy or was he mad,

1577
02:47:23.534 --> 02:47:25.324 line:82%
or was he a normal boy like you,

1578
02:47:25.828 --> 02:47:27.037 line:82%
I do not know.

1579
02:47:28.914 --> 02:47:34.128 line:82%
I just know that he listened
to his heart all his life.

1580
02:47:36.046 --> 02:47:41.427 line:82%
I just know that he gave up
everything he could do or be

1581
02:47:42.970 --> 02:47:45.681 line:82%
for the woman he loved.

1582
02:47:47.310 --> 02:47:49.143 line:82%
All I know is

1583
02:47:50.311 --> 02:47:52.940 line:82%
that he stills loves that woman.

1584
02:47:55.232 --> 02:48:00.905 line:82%
And that each day,
the love deepens more and more.

1585
02:48:05.075 --> 02:48:08.218 line:82%
How do you know so much about him?

1586
02:48:14.376 --> 02:48:16.541 line:82%
How do I know so much about him?

1587
02:48:30.643 --> 02:48:32.981 line:82%
DEAR MEGHA, I LOVE YOU
RAJ

1588
02:48:49.745 --> 02:48:54.375 line:82%
Happy Valentines Day, Megha.
Happy Valentines Day.

1589
02:49:40.588 --> 02:49:43.716 line:82%
My name is not Vikram Oberoi,
but Vikram Kapoor.

1590
02:49:45.381 --> 02:49:50.010 line:82%
My father is not a rich industrialist,
but a bank accountant.

1591
02:49:51.891 --> 02:49:54.125 line:82%
And the friendship
that I had started with a lie,

1592
02:49:55.477 --> 02:49:56.953 line:82%
I want to end with a truth.

1593
02:49:58.772 --> 02:50:04.372 line:82%
And the truth is, Miss Dhanrajgir,
that I am madly in love with you.

1594
02:50:10.951 --> 02:50:14.705 line:82%
I know it is not easy to love you.

1595
02:50:16.332 --> 02:50:20.996 line:82%
Because you are stubborn,
proud and spoiled.

1596
02:50:23.172 --> 02:50:27.509 line:82%
But behind this stubborn girl,
is a normal, little girl,

1597
02:50:28.928 --> 02:50:31.972 line:82%
who reads love stories at night.

1598
02:50:33.724 --> 02:50:35.512 line:82%
And dreams about love, even in the day.

1599
02:50:37.519 --> 02:50:41.106 line:82%
Behind this proud girl,
there is a girl with a clean heart,

1600
02:50:43.067 --> 02:50:48.864 line:82%
who sweetly accepts her mistakes
and says sorry.

1601
02:50:50.824 --> 02:50:53.145 line:82%
Behind this spoiled lshika Dhanrajgir

1602
02:50:54.745 --> 02:50:58.666 line:82%
is my cute, stupid, little lshq,

1603
02:51:00.209 --> 02:51:04.797 line:82%
whom I love and cannot live without.

1604
02:51:07.633 --> 02:51:11.727 line:82%
I love you, Ishq. I love you.

1605
02:51:47.214 --> 02:51:48.479 line:82%
You talk a lot.

1606
02:51:50.384 --> 02:51:54.805 line:82%
If you keep quieting me like this,
I will never shut up.

1607
02:52:04.231 --> 02:52:07.693 line:82%
I want you to leave Karan, for ever.

1608
02:52:08.902 --> 02:52:12.480 line:82%
But why? What have I done?

1609
02:52:13.574 --> 02:52:19.329 line:82%
You've not done anything, Karan.
iI fact, you have only given me happiness.

1610
02:52:19.859 --> 02:52:23.086 line:82%
You brought back music
and gave me your friendship,

1611
02:52:23.719 --> 02:52:26.628 line:82%
for which I will always be grateful.

1612
02:52:27.755 --> 02:52:30.998 line:82%
But you also brought back those dreams

1613
02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:35.035 line:82%
that I had kept locked away
in a little corner of my heart,

1614
02:52:36.138 --> 02:52:40.309 line:82%
Those dreams that belonged
to a 17-year-old Kiran,

1615
02:52:41.351 --> 02:52:46.303 line:82%
those dreams that have no place
in this Kiran's life.

1616
02:52:48.984 --> 02:52:51.887 line:82%
I do not have the strength
to be your friend anymore, Karan.

1617
02:52:53.781 --> 02:52:58.554 line:82%
Please forgive me and, if possible,
forget me.

1618
02:53:00.954 --> 02:53:05.125 line:82%
There is a rule of friendship, Kiran,
that once you put your hand forward,

1619
02:53:05.951 --> 02:53:07.753 line:82%
it can never be taken back.

1620
02:53:07.920 --> 02:53:09.755 line:82%
Please, Karan, go from here.

1621
02:53:09.838 --> 02:53:12.166 line:82%
Today I had come here
to tell you something, Kiran,

1622
02:53:13.425 --> 02:53:15.677 line:82%
and I am not going back till I say it.

1623
02:53:15.761 --> 02:53:16.800 line:82%
-Please.
-Karan!

1624
02:53:34.238 --> 02:53:38.592 line:82%
What did you want to tell her,
even I would like to hear it.

1625
02:53:53.132 --> 02:53:58.053 line:82%
Sir, I came here to tell her
that I love her.

1626
02:54:00.556 --> 02:54:05.832 line:82%
That I love her very much
and I know that even she--

1627
02:54:20.701 --> 02:54:23.245 line:82%
I think you have got your answer.

1628
02:54:25.107 --> 02:54:29.126 line:82%
Now leave and never come back.

1629
02:54:42.890 --> 02:54:43.932 line:82%
Wait, Karan.

1630
02:54:56.069 --> 02:54:58.562 line:82%
-Do you love this boy?
-Nandini!

1631
02:54:58.906 --> 02:55:02.659 line:82%
Tell me the truth, Kiran, do you love him?

1632
02:55:02.743 --> 02:55:05.120 line:82%
Nandini, do you realize
what you are saying?

1633
02:55:05.204 --> 02:55:09.490 line:82%
For my sake, ask your heart for once
and tell me if you love Karan.

1634
02:55:09.563 --> 02:55:12.336 line:82%
Nandini, you are talking
to a married girl.

1635
02:55:12.419 --> 02:55:13.662 line:82%
No, Major General Khanna.

1636
02:55:13.745 --> 02:55:16.210 line:82%
I am talking to a girl
whose husband is dead.

1637
02:55:17.007 --> 02:55:19.181 line:82%
I am talking to a widow,
Major General Khanna.

1638
02:55:20.178 --> 02:55:21.261 line:82%
I am talking to a widow.

1639
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:25.557 line:82%
Nandini.

1640
02:55:25.641 --> 02:55:27.226 line:82%
Look at this girl closely.

1641
02:55:27.768 --> 02:55:32.737 line:82%
And for once, do not look at her
as your youngest daughter-in-law,

1642
02:55:34.650 --> 02:55:35.969 line:82%
but look at her as that girl

1643
02:55:37.027 --> 02:55:38.612 line:82%
whom you had brought into this house

1644
02:55:38.695 --> 02:55:41.156 line:82%
with promises and dreams of a happy life.

1645
02:55:43.325 --> 02:55:47.746 line:82%
Look at her as the girl, who has,
for two years,

1646
02:55:47.829 --> 02:55:50.320 line:82%
quietly played the role
of a married girl just for you.

1647
02:55:50.701 --> 02:55:54.082 line:82%
So that by seeing her,
you can keep believing your son is alive.

1648
02:55:58.924 --> 02:56:03.866 line:82%
Look at her, and ask yourself,

1649
02:56:08.475 --> 02:56:10.889 line:82%
what is wrong
if someone falls in love with her?

1650
02:56:13.730 --> 02:56:16.233 line:82%
What is wrong
if she falls in love with someone?

1651
02:56:19.194 --> 02:56:20.352 line:82%
What is so wrong, father?

1652
02:56:24.825 --> 02:56:26.830 line:82%
Your son is dead.

1653
02:56:29.162 --> 02:56:30.419 line:82%
At least let her live.

1654
02:56:36.378 --> 02:56:37.708 line:82%
My son is not dead.

1655
02:56:40.189 --> 02:56:41.619 line:82%
My son is not dead.

1656
02:57:29.097 --> 02:57:35.236 line:82%
Ever since we used to laugh and cry
about small things, I have loved you.

1657
02:57:35.854 --> 02:57:41.735 line:82%
Ever since we used to dance
in the rains, I have loved you.

1658
02:57:43.293 --> 02:57:47.618 line:82%
When we used to sneak
out to the terrace and count the stars,

1659
02:57:48.742 --> 02:57:50.189 line:82%
I have loved you.

1660
02:57:51.578 --> 02:57:56.249 line:82%
Now, I myself have forgotten
since when, I have loved you.

1661
02:57:57.597 --> 02:58:02.672 line:82%
I can only say that I have loved you
and only you.

1662
02:58:30.826 --> 02:58:32.652 line:82%
You love me so much?

1663
02:58:37.249 --> 02:58:38.417 line:82%
Since when?

1664
02:58:40.986 --> 02:58:42.045 line:82%
Always.

1665
02:58:43.255 --> 02:58:45.814 line:82%
And till today, you never said a thing?

1666
02:58:49.594 --> 02:58:54.981 line:82%
Idiot, stupid, now what are you standing
and staring at my face for?

1667
02:58:56.726 --> 02:58:59.563 line:82%
Come on, take me in your arms.

1668
02:59:18.457 --> 02:59:22.300 line:82%
Kakeji, you used to give me roses
and all that jazz.

1669
02:59:23.170 --> 02:59:24.963 line:82%
Today am I not getting a leaf?

1670
02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:32.429 line:82%
No, Preetoji, from now on
Kake will never trouble you.

1671
02:59:34.264 --> 02:59:39.978 line:82%
Seeing these kids, I have figured
out what a perfect pair looks like.

1672
02:59:41.771 --> 02:59:44.608 line:82%
You are very pretty, very beautiful.

1673
02:59:46.485 --> 02:59:49.748 line:82%
And I'm a stupid looking and uneducated.

1674
02:59:50.071 --> 02:59:51.213 line:82%
This pair is all wrong.

1675
02:59:53.373 --> 02:59:56.083 line:82%
You need not worry, from today,

1676
02:59:56.870 --> 02:59:59.061 line:82%
you'll never have to take your shoes
in your hand,

1677
03:00:00.765 --> 03:00:03.017 line:82%
Kake will never trouble you.

1678
03:00:05.253 --> 03:00:07.001 line:82%
This is my final goodbye to you.

1679
03:00:07.964 --> 03:00:12.513 line:82%
And what if, after today,
Preeto starts troubling Kake.

1680
03:00:13.136 --> 03:00:14.137 line:82%
What?

1681
03:00:15.222 --> 03:00:19.059 line:82%
Then what. Eat sugar and die.
What do you think of yourself?

1682
03:00:19.524 --> 03:00:21.102 line:82%
Since so many years, every day,

1683
03:00:21.186 --> 03:00:25.398 line:82%
you have been giving me weird stuff,
and saying rubbish,

1684
03:00:25.815 --> 03:00:28.417 line:82%
and now you are saying
that from today you will never trouble me.

1685
03:00:28.632 --> 03:00:31.482 line:82%
Why will you not trouble me?
You'll have to trouble me!

1686
03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:35.216 line:82%
Because Preeto
has now gotten used to Kake's nonsense.

1687
03:00:36.034 --> 03:00:40.463 line:82%
And hear this too, Preeto likes Kake.

1688
03:00:41.248 --> 03:00:42.249 line:82%
You like me?

1689
03:00:42.457 --> 03:00:47.443 line:82%
Yes, and who said you are stupid looking?

1690
03:00:48.421 --> 03:00:49.798 line:82%
You are very cute.

1691
03:00:50.465 --> 03:00:51.591 line:82%
-Cute?
-Yes.

1692
03:00:52.467 --> 03:00:56.068 line:82%
Yes, and what do they say in English?
I love you.

1693
03:00:57.305 --> 03:00:59.510 line:82%
-What?
-I love you.

1694
03:01:02.936 --> 03:01:04.753 line:82%
Preetoji, come here.

1695
03:01:20.078 --> 03:01:24.916 line:82%
I can hear the bricks crumbling,
Mr. Shankar, can you hear it?

1696
03:01:27.228 --> 03:01:29.431 line:82%
The winds have changed
their direction once again.

1697
03:01:32.674 --> 03:01:37.137 line:82%
The power of love, Mr. Shankar,

1698
03:01:40.724 --> 03:01:43.603 line:82%
You better lock your windows
and doors properly, sir,

1699
03:01:44.606 --> 03:01:48.315 line:82%
because love has mingled
with the winds of your beloved Gurukul.

1700
03:01:51.594 --> 03:01:53.194 line:82%
It's not going to stop.

1701
03:01:54.654 --> 03:01:56.114 line:82%
It isn't going to give up.

1702
03:02:48.708 --> 03:02:50.960 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1703
03:02:56.508 --> 03:02:58.551 line:82%
The anklets have created a ruckus

1704
03:02:59.094 --> 03:03:01.596 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1705
03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:04.057 line:82%
The anklets have created a ruckus

1706
03:03:04.307 --> 03:03:09.300 line:82%
Shut all the doors

1707
03:03:09.479 --> 03:03:11.940 line:82%
Look, the thieves are coming

1708
03:03:12.065 --> 03:03:14.442 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1709
03:03:17.362 --> 03:03:20.281 line:82%
Break all your shackles

1710
03:03:22.573 --> 03:03:25.097 line:82%
Break all your shackles

1711
03:03:25.198 --> 03:03:27.622 line:82%
Let your anklets make their noise

1712
03:03:27.872 --> 03:03:30.333 line:82%
Break all your shackles

1713
03:03:30.427 --> 03:03:32.961 line:82%
Let your anklets make their noise

1714
03:03:33.044 --> 03:03:37.966 line:82%
Open the doors of your heart

1715
03:03:38.258 --> 03:03:40.844 line:82%
Let the thieves in

1716
03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:44.180 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1717
03:04:16.591 --> 03:04:21.676 line:82%
Oh what do I say, what do I do?
I feel so shy

1718
03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:26.723 line:82%
Don't make me pine
This is killing me

1719
03:04:27.056 --> 03:04:32.228 line:82%
First let me believe
That you truly love me

1720
03:04:32.312 --> 03:04:37.275 line:82%
If there's any doubt in
Your heart, let's forget it

1721
03:04:38.026 --> 03:04:40.820 line:82%
l won't give myself up so easily

1722
03:04:40.884 --> 03:04:43.448 line:82%
I won't unveil myself

1723
03:04:43.531 --> 03:04:45.450 line:82%
I'll think it over first

1724
03:04:45.617 --> 03:04:48.286 line:82%
Then I'll tell you tomorrow
Or the day after

1725
03:04:48.620 --> 03:04:52.874 line:82%
If you won't say yes today
Then, lady, your marital procession

1726
03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.211 line:82%
May set its path to someone else's house

1727
03:04:56.628 --> 03:04:59.130 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1728
03:05:01.777 --> 03:05:04.073 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1729
03:05:04.414 --> 03:05:06.930 line:82%
The anklets have created a ruckus

1730
03:05:07.055 --> 03:05:11.817 line:82%
Shut all the doors

1731
03:05:12.143 --> 03:05:14.727 line:82%
Look, the thieves are coming

1732
03:05:14.791 --> 03:05:17.857 line:82%
Break all your shackles

1733
03:05:22.612 --> 03:05:25.140 line:82%
Let your anklets make their noise

1734
03:05:25.242 --> 03:05:27.826 line:82%
Open the doors of your heart

1735
03:05:30.453 --> 03:05:32.956 line:82%
Let the thieves in

1736
03:05:33.122 --> 03:05:37.233 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1737
03:06:50.533 --> 03:06:55.580 line:82%
Those who are destined to meet
Shall meet, come what may

1738
03:06:55.824 --> 03:07:00.835 line:82%
Hearts blossom, even in autumn

1739
03:07:01.085 --> 03:07:05.757 line:82%
My friends, the whole world says
The heart is crazy

1740
03:07:06.301 --> 03:07:11.763 line:82%
Loving hearts say that
The world is crazy

1741
03:07:12.180 --> 03:07:16.935 line:82%
l have come, my love
I have left the world behind

1742
03:07:17.560 --> 03:07:22.065 line:82%
l have severed all ties
To bind myself to you

1743
03:07:22.482 --> 03:07:24.984 line:82%
Let's bind ourselves
To each other

1744
03:07:25.068 --> 03:07:30.531 line:82%
Let us fly together
Like kite and string

1745
03:07:30.615 --> 03:07:33.201 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1746
03:07:35.411 --> 03:07:38.039 line:82%
Our feet have been bound

1747
03:07:38.122 --> 03:07:40.500 line:82%
The anklets have created a ruckus

1748
03:07:40.959 --> 03:07:45.800 line:82%
Shut all the doors

1749
03:07:46.255 --> 03:07:48.841 line:82%
Look, the thieves are coming

1750
03:07:48.925 --> 03:07:51.928 line:82%
Break all your shackles

1751
03:07:54.014 --> 03:07:56.292 line:82%
Break all your shackles

1752
03:07:56.621 --> 03:07:59.227 line:82%
Let your anklets make their noise

1753
03:07:59.310 --> 03:08:01.813 line:82%
Open the doors of your heart

1754
03:08:04.524 --> 03:08:07.151 line:82%
Let the thieves in

1755
03:08:07.235 --> 03:08:09.612 line:82%
Shut all the doors

1756
03:08:12.198 --> 03:08:14.384 line:82%
Look, the thieves are coming

1757
03:08:14.473 --> 03:08:17.161 line:82%
Let the thieves in

1758
03:08:17.245 --> 03:08:19.252 line:82%
Look, the thieves are coming

1759
03:08:19.352 --> 03:08:22.125 line:82%
Let the thieves in

1760
03:08:56.826 --> 03:08:59.620 line:82%
No, Preetoji, I won't let you go
until you hug me.

1761
03:09:41.204 --> 03:09:45.416 line:82%
For all the hatred in the world

1762
03:09:46.501 --> 03:09:50.880 line:82%
There still exists love within hearts

1763
03:09:51.756 --> 03:09:56.010 line:82%
For all the hatred in the world

1764
03:09:57.015 --> 03:10:01.119 line:82%
There still exists love within hearts

1765
03:10:01.477 --> 03:10:06.145 line:82%
Even after the lovers meet their end

1766
03:10:06.729 --> 03:10:11.400 line:82%
Even after their beloveds have perished

1767
03:10:12.148 --> 03:10:16.758 line:82%
Their loves live on, forever

1768
03:10:17.276 --> 03:10:22.427 line:82%
Their loves live on, forever

1769
03:11:09.083 --> 03:11:13.629 line:82%
Even after the lovers have met their end

1770
03:11:14.198 --> 03:11:18.661 line:82%
Even after their beloveds have perished

1771
03:11:19.468 --> 03:11:24.218 line:82%
Their loves live on, forever

1772
03:11:24.589 --> 03:11:29.339 line:82%
Their loves live on, forever

1773
03:12:09.518 --> 03:12:12.765 line:82%
I know that this is not the first time
that you have broken the rules of Gurukul.

1774
03:12:16.734 --> 03:12:20.152 line:82%
I also know that you are responsible
for the others behaving in the same way.

1775
03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.122 line:82%
You have left me with no choice,

1776
03:12:39.149 --> 03:12:40.731 line:82%
but before I take a decision,

1777
03:12:42.635 --> 03:12:44.456 line:82%
I'd like to ask
the three of you a question,

1778
03:12:46.257 --> 03:12:48.884 line:82%
and I'd like you to think
very carefully before answering.

1779
03:12:52.103 --> 03:12:56.640 line:82%
Because whatever you say
will decide your fate.

1780
03:13:09.370 --> 03:13:12.331 line:82%
Did the three of you take this step
out of your own free will,

1781
03:13:13.804 --> 03:13:15.327 line:82%
or is someone else responsible?

1782
03:13:18.242 --> 03:13:19.900 line:82%
Someone who encouraged

1783
03:13:20.786 --> 03:13:25.024 line:82%
and forced you all to do this.

1784
03:13:29.348 --> 03:13:30.765 line:82%
Think carefully and answer.

1785
03:13:38.566 --> 03:13:42.180 line:82%
We are responsible for all our actions,

1786
03:13:43.654 --> 03:13:45.058 line:82%
and no one else.

1787
03:13:45.990 --> 03:13:49.952 line:82%
We did what our hearts told us to do.

1788
03:13:50.911 --> 03:13:52.739 line:82%
And we do not regret anything,

1789
03:13:54.018 --> 03:13:56.350 line:82%
because we do not think
we did anything wrong.

1790
03:14:06.469 --> 03:14:10.804 line:82%
This is your last day in Gurukul,
start packing your bags.

1791
03:14:12.016 --> 03:14:14.234 line:82%
You'll will be expelled in the morning.

1792
03:16:12.803 --> 03:16:16.038 line:82%
You won...I lost.

1793
03:16:18.476 --> 03:16:20.608 line:82%
But do not punish them for my mistakes.

1794
03:16:21.854 --> 03:16:23.271 line:82%
Do not do this to them, please.

1795
03:16:25.524 --> 03:16:27.609 line:82%
I did not come here
to make another Raj Aryan.

1796
03:16:29.695 --> 03:16:34.408 line:82%
I came here to make sure
that no one else becomes a Raj Aryan.

1797
03:16:35.910 --> 03:16:37.173 line:82%
Forgive them.

1798
03:16:40.206 --> 03:16:44.020 line:82%
Your battle is with me
and I am in front of you.

1799
03:16:45.169 --> 03:16:47.630 line:82%
Defeated...and lost.

1800
03:16:49.423 --> 03:16:54.455 line:82%
Whatever you say will happen.
I will do whatever you want.

1801
03:16:56.597 --> 03:16:58.057 line:82%
Just forgive them, please.

1802
03:17:00.851 --> 03:17:04.313 line:82%
You won...I lost.

1803
03:17:27.419 --> 03:17:29.421 line:82%
I want you to come tomorrow morning

1804
03:17:29.505 --> 03:17:31.402 line:82%
and tell the students

1805
03:17:33.150 --> 03:17:35.192 line:82%
that whatever you have taught them,

1806
03:17:36.428 --> 03:17:41.267 line:82%
and believed in, was a lie,
was a deception.

1807
03:17:44.895 --> 03:17:49.650 line:82%
I want you to tell them,
that you do not believe in love.

1808
03:17:51.193 --> 03:17:55.185 line:82%
And that you consider it a joke yourself.

1809
03:17:58.909 --> 03:18:02.618 line:82%
Then apologize for misleading them.

1810
03:18:05.708 --> 03:18:11.672 line:82%
And then...quietly leave Gurukul.

1811
03:18:15.843 --> 03:18:21.807 line:82%
And go so far, that even if you wished,
you could not find your way back.

1812
03:18:26.770 --> 03:18:27.813 line:82%
Yes.

1813
03:18:33.152 --> 03:18:35.738 line:82%
Good, you can go now.

1814
03:18:48.539 --> 03:18:53.554 line:82%
I had told you, Mr. Aryan,
in the battle of love and fear,

1815
03:18:55.090 --> 03:18:56.467 line:82%
fear will always win.

1816
03:18:57.760 --> 03:18:59.859 line:82%
I had told you I would win, Mr. Aryan.

1817
03:19:02.806 --> 03:19:03.836 line:82%
I had told you.

1818
03:19:18.113 --> 03:19:19.273 line:82%
I am sorry, sir,

1819
03:19:21.033 --> 03:19:24.961 line:82%
but from where I stand, you lost.

1820
03:19:27.456 --> 03:19:31.974 line:82%
Because from where I stand,
I see a 55-year-old father standing

1821
03:19:34.254 --> 03:19:37.598 line:82%
below a garlanded photograph
of his 19-year-old daughter.

1822
03:19:41.261 --> 03:19:46.100 line:82%
You lost then...and you lost now.

1823
03:19:54.483 --> 03:19:57.305 line:82%
You ever wondered, Mr. Shankar,
about why I returned?

1824
03:19:59.196 --> 03:20:00.280 line:82%
For whom?

1825
03:20:02.199 --> 03:20:06.829 line:82%
The girl I love is no more.

1826
03:20:08.330 --> 03:20:11.375 line:82%
Who are Vicky, Sameer, and Karan to me?

1827
03:20:12.918 --> 03:20:17.715 line:82%
I did not even know them.
I did not know anyone here.

1828
03:20:21.844 --> 03:20:26.115 line:82%
I came back for you, Mr. Shankar.

1829
03:20:28.851 --> 03:20:33.939 line:82%
I came back
for the father of the girl I loved.

1830
03:20:38.444 --> 03:20:39.694 line:82%
I came back...

1831
03:20:41.321 --> 03:20:44.783 line:82%
...because she always told me
that you were a very loving man.

1832
03:20:45.367 --> 03:20:49.433 line:82%
That you were just hard from the outside,
but very soft from the inside.

1833
03:20:51.373 --> 03:20:54.334 line:82%
I came to break that hardness.

1834
03:20:57.906 --> 03:21:02.558 line:82%
Do you know, Mr. Shankar,
I do not have any photograph of Megha.

1835
03:21:04.511 --> 03:21:06.013 line:82%
I never felt the need for it.

1836
03:21:07.389 --> 03:21:12.394 line:82%
Because I see Megha wherever I see love.

1837
03:21:14.772 --> 03:21:18.111 line:82%
I thought if I could make just one
love story bloom in front of your eyes,

1838
03:21:20.402 --> 03:21:21.862 line:82%
you too would see her.

1839
03:21:23.781 --> 03:21:29.411 line:82%
And you would see how happy she is,
and maybe that will take your pain away.

1840
03:21:33.207 --> 03:21:35.428 line:82%
I had come to share your pain,
Mr. Shankar.

1841
03:21:37.503 --> 03:21:39.046 line:82%
I had come to show you love.

1842
03:21:42.174 --> 03:21:44.235 line:82%
I came here because l realized one thing,

1843
03:21:46.094 --> 03:21:47.892 line:82%
that Megha was incomplete without you,

1844
03:21:50.224 --> 03:21:55.395 line:82%
but you fail to realize even now,
that she was incomplete without me too.

1845
03:21:58.023 --> 03:22:00.150 line:82%
We together made her complete.

1846
03:22:02.110 --> 03:22:06.990 line:82%
I came to complete
what you couldn't do in her lifetime.

1847
03:22:09.868 --> 03:22:11.702 line:82%
I came to complete Megha.

1848
03:22:20.838 --> 03:22:22.965 line:82%
You won every battle of life,

1849
03:22:25.425 --> 03:22:27.756 line:82%
but you lost everything
that was worth living for.

1850
03:22:31.056 --> 03:22:32.599 line:82%
You lost a daughter, then.

1851
03:22:36.270 --> 03:22:37.729 line:82%
And today, you have lost a son.

1852
03:22:41.608 --> 03:22:42.736 line:82%
I am sorry, sir,

1853
03:22:44.945 --> 03:22:49.303 line:82%
but from where I stand,
you lost everything.

1854
03:22:51.577 --> 03:22:54.913 line:82%
Because I see

1855
03:22:55.150 --> 03:22:58.643 line:82%
a stubborn, ill-fated man...

1856
03:23:00.252 --> 03:23:04.766 line:82%
...standing with his back turned
to the two people

1857
03:23:06.675 --> 03:23:08.844 line:82%
who loved him the most in the world.

1858
03:23:20.814 --> 03:23:24.526 line:82%
I am sorry, sir, I am sorry.

1859
03:25:25.731 --> 03:25:28.576 line:82%
For 25 years,
I have been very proud of the fact

1860
03:25:28.661 --> 03:25:31.236 line:82%
that I've run this institution

1861
03:25:31.319 --> 03:25:34.531 line:82%
with tradition, honor, and discipline.

1862
03:25:36.908 --> 03:25:39.619 line:82%
Believing that I have made my students

1863
03:25:41.538 --> 03:25:42.956 line:82%
stronger,

1864
03:25:44.332 --> 03:25:48.545 line:82%
more complete, and better men.

1865
03:25:50.797 --> 03:25:53.703 line:82%
Men who will win every battle in life.

1866
03:25:56.553 --> 03:25:58.847 line:82%
I have been very proud of the fact...

1867
03:26:00.390 --> 03:26:03.310 line:82%
...that in every student of Gurukul,

1868
03:26:05.353 --> 03:26:06.930 line:82%
there lives a bit of Narayan Shankar.

1869
03:26:10.025 --> 03:26:13.766 line:82%
But, today, as I stand before you,
I am not feeling so proud.

1870
03:26:17.282 --> 03:26:19.863 line:82%
Because, today,
the Narayan Shankar that stands before you

1871
03:26:22.245 --> 03:26:23.361 line:82%
is not one I admire.

1872
03:26:28.668 --> 03:26:34.591 line:82%
Today, Narayan Shankar
is a man who did not win

1873
03:26:36.801 --> 03:26:38.015 line:82%
the battle of life.

1874
03:26:43.475 --> 03:26:47.020 line:82%
He has lost.

1875
03:26:49.898 --> 03:26:52.211 line:82%
He is a stubborn, ill-fated man...

1876
03:26:54.611 --> 03:26:56.750 line:82%
...who just didn't understand
the meaning of life.

1877
03:27:02.744 --> 03:27:04.794 line:82%
And today, when he looks back,

1878
03:27:07.165 --> 03:27:10.214 line:82%
He sees all his students sad and lonely,

1879
03:27:12.101 --> 03:27:13.713 line:82%
just like him.

1880
03:27:16.716 --> 03:27:19.242 line:82%
Because he knows,
he never smiled at them...

1881
03:27:20.929 --> 03:27:23.056 line:82%
...when they were scared.

1882
03:27:26.184 --> 03:27:31.356 line:82%
He never patted their backs
when they did well.

1883
03:27:33.900 --> 03:27:37.195 line:82%
He never embraced them when they were sad.

1884
03:27:41.658 --> 03:27:44.051 line:82%
Because he always believed in one law,

1885
03:27:44.141 --> 03:27:46.329 line:82%
that love and affection leads to pain.

1886
03:27:47.956 --> 03:27:51.293 line:82%
And pain makes man weak.

1887
03:27:54.087 --> 03:28:00.051 line:82%
And, in this process, he became so hard,
that he forgot how to love.

1888
03:28:05.348 --> 03:28:11.062 line:82%
And today, he wants to go back
to each of his students,

1889
03:28:13.356 --> 03:28:18.111 line:82%
hold them in his arms
apologize to them

1890
03:28:18.195 --> 03:28:20.227 line:82%
and tell them one simple thing,

1891
03:28:22.866 --> 03:28:24.618 line:82%
that life is about giving

1892
03:28:24.701 --> 03:28:27.621 line:82%
and receiving love, and nothing else.

1893
03:28:35.545 --> 03:28:40.425 line:82%
But he knows he cannot do that,
he cannot go back.

1894
03:28:44.012 --> 03:28:45.870 line:82%
But there is something he can do.

1895
03:28:48.266 --> 03:28:50.598 line:82%
Something that he has not done
for 25 years.

1896
03:28:52.020 --> 03:28:54.356 line:82%
Something that he should
have done a long time back,

1897
03:28:56.024 --> 03:29:01.071 line:82%
And that is change.
He will have to change.

1898
03:29:04.199 --> 03:29:07.186 line:82%
The old generation will have to change
their old traditions,

1899
03:29:08.616 --> 03:29:13.059 line:82%
so that the new generation
can create a new tradition.

1900
03:29:20.715 --> 03:29:25.220 line:82%
Now, it's time for me to step down

1901
03:29:28.139 --> 03:29:31.205 line:82%
and to give you someone
who has shown me

1902
03:29:32.727 --> 03:29:36.690 line:82%
that respect is not earned by fear,
but by love.

1903
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:48.243 line:82%
Mr. Raj Aryan, please come up.

1904
03:30:32.746 --> 03:30:34.664 line:82%
I request you to please take over

1905
03:30:36.624 --> 03:30:39.002 line:82%
the responsibility of managing Gurukul,

1906
03:30:41.338 --> 03:30:42.547 line:82%
and to teach my students

1907
03:30:44.591 --> 03:30:47.427 line:82%
the meaning of love and life.

1908
03:30:49.888 --> 03:30:54.684 line:82%
So that, from today onwards,
I can proudly say

1909
03:30:56.603 --> 03:30:59.022 line:82%
that there is a Raj Aryan

1910
03:31:00.815 --> 03:31:03.142 line:82%
in each and every student of Gurukul.

1911
03:31:07.572 --> 03:31:08.620 line:82%
And maybe then...

1912
03:31:14.704 --> 03:31:16.706 line:82%
...my daughter will forgive me.

1913
03:31:29.677 --> 03:31:32.263 line:82%
GURUKUL

1914
03:32:23.727 --> 03:32:26.901 line:82%
Yes, the doors to Gurukul opened forever.

1915
03:32:27.402 --> 03:32:30.780 line:82%
And the colors of Holi
colored the winds forever.

1916
03:32:31.322 --> 03:32:33.375 line:82%
Now singing, dancing, laughter, happiness,

1917
03:32:33.658 --> 03:32:35.608 line:82%
became the new identity of Gurukul.

1918
03:32:36.119 --> 03:32:37.370 line:82%
Everything changed.

1919
03:32:37.745 --> 03:32:39.706 line:82%
Yes, Surya Namaskar too.

1920
03:32:40.201 --> 03:32:45.282 line:82%
Now we do not stare at the sun.
Instead we open our arms,

1921
03:32:45.643 --> 03:32:47.523 line:82%
close our eyes, and bask in the sunshine.

1922
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:49.090 line:82%
Now there is everything here,

1923
03:32:49.191 --> 03:32:52.209 line:82%
music, friendship, love

1924
03:32:52.719 --> 03:32:53.895 line:82%
and Megha.
