1
00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:48.299 line:80%
Thanks for bringing me home.

2
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:50.760 line:80%
Ji-won.

3
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.013 line:80%
Are you not feeling well?

4
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.684 line:80%
To be honest, my stomach has been hurting
since earlier.

5
00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:00.186 line:80%
Your stomach...

6
00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.291 line:80%
Mr. Yu...

7
00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:24.752 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

8
00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:26.003 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

9
00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:27.588 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

10
00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:55.783 line:80%
Welcome. Where can I take you?

11
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.285 line:80%
Sir, do you see that man sitting there?

12
00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.372 line:80%
-Go over there.
-What? Right up there?

13
00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:10.589 line:80%
Min-hwan?

14
00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:16.679 line:80%
Are you hurt?

15
00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.098 line:80%
Goodness!

16
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.892 line:80%
Did you get into a fight?

17
00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:52.798 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

18
00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:02.808 line:80%
You passed out,
so I brought you to the hospital.

19
00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:07.104 line:80%
You woke up. Your results just came out.

20
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.737 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk, 30, type A blood.
Is that correct?

21
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.863 line:80%
Yes.

22
00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:17.865 line:80%
You must've lacked sleep lately.

23
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.034 line:80%
A little.

24
00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:21.702 line:80%
You eat irregular meals.

25
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.454 line:80%
You must've drank a lot too.

26
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:26.749 line:80%
Has something been stressing you out?

27
00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:34.006 line:80%
You pushed yourself too hard,
so your brain decided to shut down.

28
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.802 line:80%
Your autonomic nervous system has issues.
We should run more tests.

29
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.721 line:80%
How's your digestion?

30
00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:43.140 line:80%
I'm sure you had stomach problems.

31
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.476 line:80%
Oh, right. Does your stomach hurt?

32
00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:47.478 line:80%
Me?

33
00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.648 line:80%
She has stomach issues. Can you run tests?

34
00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:51.815 line:80%
Excuse me?

35
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.694 line:80%
Your guardian?
Do you have a medical history?

36
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:58.614 line:80%
No, it's just gastritis.
I don't need tests.

37
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.617 line:80%
No, you looked like
you were in pain earlier.

38
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.244 line:80%
It might feel okay because you're shocked.

39
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.205 line:80%
Let's have her tested.

40
00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:08.540 line:80%
No, I had CT scans done recently.

41
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:09.833 line:80%
It's just gastritis.

42
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.128 line:80%
You had CT scans done?

43
00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:15.547 line:80%
Why?

44
00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:22.262 line:80%
Well, just because.

45
00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:24.056 line:80%
Just because? CT scans?

46
00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:29.645 line:80%
But how did you know I had a bad stomach?

47
00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.147 line:80%
Because...

48
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.151 line:80%
I saw you take medicine often at work.

49
00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:42.449 line:80%
Then to be fair,
why don't we run tests on both of you?

50
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.724 line:80%
Min-hwan...

51
00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:28.787 line:80%
No, stop.

52
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.291 line:80%
I can't hurt Ji-won.

53
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.334 line:80%
I would rather die...

54
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:38.255 line:80%
I...

55
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.008 line:80%
will leave.

56
00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:45.554 line:80%
Well, I...

57
00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.849 line:80%
Not so easily.

58
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.194 line:80%
Don't cry, you dummy.

59
00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:02.154 line:80%
What do we do?

60
00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.867 line:80%
Ji-won...

61
00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.037 line:80%
What do we do?

62
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.468 line:80%
-You can keep the change. Yes.
-Are you sure?

63
00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:08.637 line:80%
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

64
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.062 line:80%
So he got out of the cab here?

65
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.527 line:80%
Get home safely, then.

66
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.323 line:80%
I'll take you home.
My car's near there anyway.

67
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.033 line:80%
Right...

68
00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:41.461 line:80%
I'm a good person.

69
00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:50.512 line:80%
He is a good person.

70
00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:55.350 line:80%
But is it possible for me to trust someone

71
00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:57.227 line:80%
and start over?

72
00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.022 line:80%
I have a boyfriend.

73
00:08:01.732 --> 00:08:03.442 line:80%
He's your subordinate.

74
00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:07.821 line:80%
And I'm in an awkward situation
because of what happened today.

75
00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:13.160 line:80%
I bet he's thinking about this
a lot right now, so...

76
00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.370 line:80%
Then tell him to be more thoughtful.

77
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.083 line:80%
Tell him to always treat you

78
00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.046 line:80%
more thoughtfully and carefully.

79
00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.262 line:80%
You'll take a cab, right?

80
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.483 line:80%
I like you.

81
00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:52.074 line:80%
But I won't do anything
if you don't want me to

82
00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:53.700 line:80%
or put you in a fix.

83
00:08:57.663 --> 00:08:59.748 line:80%
You just need to say,

84
00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:01.625 line:80%
"No."

85
00:09:06.964 --> 00:09:07.798 line:80%
I...

86
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.008 line:80%
But not right now.

87
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.219 line:80%
Think about it first.

88
00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:19.268 line:80%
I won't do anything if you say no.
So before then...

89
00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.813 line:80%
Mr. Park should be a little...

90
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:26.316 line:80%
No, I hope he'll be a lot more thoughtful.

91
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.403 line:80%
And as for you,

92
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.783 line:80%
I hope you take your time
thinking about it positively.

93
00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:42.791 line:80%
I promise choosing me
will be a good choice.

94
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.920 line:80%
I know it's difficult to prove,

95
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.631 line:80%
but I'm a really good person.

96
00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:00.559 line:80%
I won't get in, so don't worry.

97
00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.550 line:80%
Wow, I seriously couldn't sleep a wink.

98
00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:40.552 line:80%
Good morning. I'm bringing you coffee
on my way to the restaurant.

99
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.728 line:80%
You were waiting outside.

100
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:53.773 line:80%
But traffic is bad.
Did you come all the way to give me this?

101
00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:55.442 line:80%
Well, yes.

102
00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.028 line:80%
-Thanks.
-Sure.

103
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:01.364 line:80%
I had business here.

104
00:13:17.214 --> 00:13:20.342 line:80%
Emergency!
Mr. Yu's in a terrible mood today!

105
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:21.760 line:80%
Don't stand out today.

106
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.599 line:80%
He seems the same.

107
00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.810 line:80%
No, he's not happy and not feeling well.

108
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.566 line:80%
How do you know, Hui-yeon?

109
00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:39.152 line:80%
Because they're siblings.

110
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.781 line:80%
But they don't resemble each other at all.

111
00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.533 line:80%
I would never have guessed it.

112
00:13:49.538 --> 00:13:52.707 line:80%
You're the one who doesn't look well.
Are you not well?

113
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.045 line:80%
Hello. Good morning!

114
00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:01.925 line:80%
Did you sleep well?

115
00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:03.426 line:80%
Yeah.

116
00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:12.727 line:80%
Hello, good...

117
00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:28.618 line:80%
What? Why?

118
00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:49.222 line:80%
Why act up if she was going
to walk on eggshells?

119
00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:52.601 line:80%
This is why women need to be stomped on
every three days.

120
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.520 line:80%
This is a no smoking area.

121
00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:57.439 line:80%
Right. Sure, sir!

122
00:14:58.857 --> 00:14:59.691 line:80%
No, wait.

123
00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.361 line:80%
What was yesterday about?

124
00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:06.323 line:80%
Office relationships are banned at U&K.

125
00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:09.701 line:80%
A dating ban?

126
00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:13.038 line:80%
In this day and age? That's so outdated.

127
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.665 line:80%
That's why
it hasn't been applied for long.

128
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.418 line:80%
So most people don't know,
but it still exists.

129
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.087 line:80%
-I mean--
-It exists

130
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.048 line:80%
because it affects work.

131
00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:26.635 line:80%
Like how you acted today, Mr. Park.

132
00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:35.435 line:80%
Enough with the stupid company rules.
Let's talk about common sense.

133
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.606 line:80%
Explain yesterday.
Are you stalking my girlfriend?

134
00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:40.940 line:80%
Or is it mutual?

135
00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.280 line:80%
Right behind that alley,

136
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.742 line:80%
there's our company's warehouse.

137
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:51.785 line:80%
What?

138
00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.621 line:80%
U&K WAREHOUSE

139
00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.666 line:80%
So there is. Yes.

140
00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.794 line:80%
On my way there,
I saw a staff's safety compromised.

141
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:04.547 line:80%
But before she's your subordinate,

142
00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:07.425 line:80%
she's my girlfriend.
That's our private lives.

143
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.344 line:80%
It's affecting work.

144
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.639 line:80%
Like how you acted when you came to work.

145
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:19.020 line:80%
Not everyone becomes an adult with age.

146
00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:20.689 line:80%
Or become a man.

147
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:24.526 line:80%
Women are unhappy when they date a boy
instead of a man.

148
00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:29.114 line:80%
So for Ji-won's sake, you should break up.

149
00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:33.576 line:80%
Break up...

150
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.331 line:80%
Don't you think you're out of line?

151
00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:41.209 line:80%
Then let's say it's because I like her.

152
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:42.919 line:80%
You like her?

153
00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:44.421 line:80%
What are you...

154
00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:48.591 line:80%
Either way.

155
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.554 line:80%
Don't lay a finger on her again.

156
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.228 line:80%
You don't know her that well...

157
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:02.313 line:80%
-What time is it?
-What?

158
00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:06.484 line:80%
What are you doing?

159
00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:08.153 line:80%
It's 11:30 a.m.

160
00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:09.904 line:80%
What are you doing?

161
00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.783 line:80%
You didn't hit her, right?

162
00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:15.577 line:80%
Excuse me? What?

163
00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.580 line:80%
You didn't hit her, right?

164
00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:20.665 line:80%
No, I didn't!

165
00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.919 line:80%
And will you not threaten her again?

166
00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:29.883 line:80%
I won't!

167
00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.093 line:80%
And about what happened yesterday?

168
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.055 line:80%
Fine, I'll let it go!

169
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.570 line:80%
What was that?

170
00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:51.821 line:80%
What's his problem?

171
00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:54.699 line:80%
Damn it.

172
00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.788 line:80%
-Min-hwan!
-Oh, God!

173
00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:02.791 line:80%
Why would you sneak up on me?

174
00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:06.753 line:80%
You're getting on my nerves more and more.

175
00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:09.506 line:80%
Are you angry about yesterday?

176
00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.468 line:80%
I thought about it, and maybe we should...

177
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:16.679 line:80%
If we break up now,
will something happen with Su-min?

178
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.848 line:80%
It think it's progressing.

179
00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.563 line:80%
Did it hurt yesterday?

180
00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.733 line:80%
I'm sorry I grabbed you.

181
00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:33.154 line:80%
But you know you were wrong too, right?

182
00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:36.491 line:80%
If you hadn't overreacted,
he never would've stepped in!

183
00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:39.494 line:80%
I'm not a piece of trash
that would hurt women!

184
00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:41.329 line:80%
Violence is a crime. A crime!

185
00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:43.373 line:80%
You treated me like a criminal.

186
00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.837 line:80%
You're so dumb that it drives me crazy.

187
00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:53.633 line:80%
I've held back all this time
since you were so nice to me, but...

188
00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.014 line:80%
I should discipline you now.

189
00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:02.767 line:80%
Let's go.

190
00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.898 line:80%
He let it go so easily.

191
00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.442 line:80%
Will we not break up over this?

192
00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.403 line:80%
Or is something changed?

193
00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:16.781 line:80%
I have nothing solid against Yu Ji-hyuk.

194
00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:20.410 line:80%
He claims he saw us
on his way to the warehouse.

195
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.787 line:80%
And I didn't do anything praiseworthy.

196
00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:25.623 line:80%
Hurry up.

197
00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:26.749 line:80%
Okay...

198
00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.253 line:80%
-Did you go straight home last night?
-What?

199
00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.053 line:80%
I'll go inside now.

200
00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.140 line:80%
Yeah, sure. Of course.

201
00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.600 line:80%
I should go too.

202
00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.644 line:80%
So this is where you live.

203
00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:49.898 line:80%
The neighborhood is so pretty and nice.

204
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.691 line:80%
I like being with you.

205
00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:54.360 line:80%
What?

206
00:19:57.989 --> 00:19:59.157 line:80%
But...

207
00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:03.161 line:80%
it's too complicated, right?

208
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.457 line:80%
Yeah, it is.

209
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:20.345 line:80%
But just for tonight,
I want to be honest to myself.

210
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:36.611 line:80%
Thanks for taking me home. Get home safe!

211
00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:43.701 line:80%
Of course. Where else would I go?

212
00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:53.211 line:80%
Something's up.
Or he wouldn't let it go like this.

213
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:57.090 line:80%
It's hard to find
better marriage material than her.

214
00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.175 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk is the problem.

215
00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:01.302 line:80%
She only has eyes for me.

216
00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:04.764 line:80%
-I have to get it together.
-You'd better get it together.

217
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.651 line:80%
I like you.

218
00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.572 line:80%
But I won't do anything
if you don't want me to

219
00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.366 line:80%
or put you in a fix.

220
00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:39.549 line:80%
Kang Ji-won.

221
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:42.802 line:80%
Let's have lunch.

222
00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:47.473 line:80%
Ms. Yang, you know where it is, right?
Meet me there.

223
00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:56.149 line:80%
You saw it.

224
00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.443 line:80%
Let's pass on lunch today.

225
00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:00.069 line:80%
Then...

226
00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.239 line:80%
Su-min's by herself.

227
00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.409 line:80%
I'm not hungry.

228
00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:09.579 line:80%
I'll just drink some coffee
in the lounge alone.

229
00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:11.706 line:80%
No, you shouldn't...

230
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.668 line:80%
Something really has started.

231
00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:21.966 line:80%
Okay...

232
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.426 line:80%
You shouldn't do that.

233
00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:26.721 line:80%
You can't skip a meal.
You're already too skinny.

234
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:31.434 line:80%
Don't do that.
Take her out and get her something good.

235
00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:36.355 line:80%
-Something good?
-I'd treat you,

236
00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:38.649 line:80%
but because of Mr. Kim...

237
00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:40.443 line:80%
Oh, right.

238
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:44.238 line:80%
Do this for me.
You can pay for it with my credit card.

239
00:22:44.322 --> 00:22:46.574 line:80%
-Can I really?
-Go somewhere nice.

240
00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:48.159 line:80%
Okay.

241
00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:55.291 line:80%
Steak?

242
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:06.552 line:80%
Sorry I'm late. I'm just so busy.

243
00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:08.054 line:80%
Did you wait long?

244
00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:14.352 line:80%
Do you know Director Wang Heung-in?
The marketing director.

245
00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:16.896 line:80%
Do I have to see this for you to decide?

246
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.858 line:80%
He's my father-in-law's cousin.

247
00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:22.693 line:80%
So I have to help a lot.

248
00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:28.282 line:80%
You have no idea how comfortable it is
to get paid without knowing anything.

249
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:39.377 line:80%
I'm not a fan of soy sauce.

250
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.213 line:80%
This goes better with
chojang
, right?

251
00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:46.467 line:80%
Why aren't you eating? Eat up.

252
00:23:56.394 --> 00:23:58.938 line:80%
You don't know how to eat this.

253
00:23:59.564 --> 00:24:02.066 line:80%
Who eats sushi with chopsticks?

254
00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:08.322 line:80%
I guess you're just lucky to be here.
Where can you find a boss like me?

255
00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:13.119 line:80%
All you did was bring me an idea,
and I give you the hardworking Ms. Yang

256
00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:14.579 line:80%
and the pretty Su-min.

257
00:24:14.662 --> 00:24:17.373 line:80%
I'm even having the director help you.

258
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.545 line:80%
The proposal's a little sloppy,
but we need to make it work.

259
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:25.173 line:80%
I'll work hard.

260
00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:28.718 line:80%
Goodness. That's not the problem.

261
00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:31.512 line:80%
It's not something
an assistant manager can do.

262
00:24:32.263 --> 00:24:35.099 line:80%
I don't plan on interrupting your work.

263
00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:38.936 line:80%
However, I'm lending you my name.

264
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.149 line:80%
I want to make sure this works out.
Why else would I do this?

265
00:24:43.232 --> 00:24:48.196 line:80%
So he's saying he'll have me do
all the work and he'll take the credit?

266
00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:53.034 line:80%
Come to think of it, that's unrealistic.

267
00:24:53.117 --> 00:24:54.702 line:80%
It won't progress.

268
00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:57.580 line:80%
It'll take forever to make the meal kits.

269
00:24:57.663 --> 00:25:00.583 line:80%
Let's change the wrapping and ingredients.

270
00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:01.918 line:80%
What's that called?

271
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:06.339 line:80%
Right. Borrow a famous chef's name
and turn it into a brand.

272
00:25:06.422 --> 00:25:08.841 line:80%
We can use our company's distribution.

273
00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:13.221 line:80%
If we push this well,
we can launch it by this summer.

274
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:14.931 line:80%
But...

275
00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:17.391 line:80%
Package three-minute meatball well

276
00:25:17.475 --> 00:25:20.311 line:80%
and put a chef's name on it.
It's luxurious steak.

277
00:25:20.394 --> 00:25:21.562 line:80%
We can't do that.

278
00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:24.607 line:80%
What?

279
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:29.570 line:80%
The point is to cook famous restaurants'
food conveniently at home.

280
00:25:29.654 --> 00:25:31.113 line:80%
What logic is that?

281
00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:35.868 line:80%
That's your point!
My point is to get promoted with this!

282
00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:38.788 line:80%
Ms. Yang will get promoted too.

283
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:41.415 line:80%
That's how your future will open.

284
00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:44.752 line:80%
Someone in your position
should just do what she's told.

285
00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:48.839 line:80%
You're hopeless.

286
00:25:48.923 --> 00:25:51.425 line:80%
You're too stubborn and foolish to work.

287
00:25:52.218 --> 00:25:53.219 line:80%
However,

288
00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:54.929 line:80%
-this proposal--
-Forget it.

289
00:25:55.429 --> 00:25:56.555 line:80%
You're out.

290
00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:00.268 line:80%
Mr. Kim.

291
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:02.186 line:80%
This is my proposal.

292
00:26:04.522 --> 00:26:06.399 line:80%
You're funny.

293
00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:07.817 line:80%
Why is this yours?

294
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.654 line:80%
Technically, it belongs to the company.

295
00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:13.864 line:80%
I approved it to be developed.

296
00:26:13.948 --> 00:26:15.700 line:80%
Ms. Yang also helped. Right?

297
00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.410 line:80%
What about Ms. Yang's idea?

298
00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:23.499 line:80%
Ji-won, we all worked together.
Why do you try to do it your way?

299
00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:25.001 line:80%
Are you not invested?

300
00:26:26.377 --> 00:26:27.962 line:80%
You're off the team.

301
00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:31.924 line:80%
Hand it over to Ms. Yang and Su-min.

302
00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:54.655 line:80%
Isn't this a really nice place?

303
00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:57.950 line:80%
I wish I could take you somewhere nicer.

304
00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:00.202 line:80%
Really?

305
00:27:01.412 --> 00:27:02.663 line:80%
I'm so happy.

306
00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:06.792 line:80%
You know that lunch?

307
00:27:06.876 --> 00:27:08.169 line:80%
Bring me my usual.

308
00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:11.047 line:80%
What about wine, sir?

309
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:15.343 line:80%
Keep my bottle.

310
00:27:16.093 --> 00:27:17.970 line:80%
Is there any good wine today?

311
00:27:18.054 --> 00:27:21.015 line:80%
I recommend Henri Brion 2008

312
00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:23.809 line:80%
to pair with today's course.

313
00:27:23.893 --> 00:27:27.146 line:80%
The flavors are deep
with the French oak aging method...

314
00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:29.690 line:80%
He really is a decent guy.

315
00:27:29.774 --> 00:27:34.028 line:80%
He's got great manners, and he's smart.
He works for a conglomerate too.

316
00:27:34.904 --> 00:27:37.782 line:80%
He's the most decent man
Ji-won has ever met.

317
00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:49.960 line:80%
You pretty thing.
Has she fallen for me yet?

318
00:27:50.503 --> 00:27:52.421 line:80%
You can really feel the flavors.

319
00:27:52.963 --> 00:27:54.590 line:80%
Which wine shall I prepare?

320
00:27:57.051 --> 00:28:00.805 line:80%
-The last one with the flavors.
-Yes, sir. I'll prepare it.

321
00:28:06.394 --> 00:28:09.230 line:80%
Did you rest well last night?

322
00:28:11.816 --> 00:28:14.568 line:80%
I couldn't sleep at all.

323
00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:24.787 line:80%
What about you?

324
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:29.083 line:80%
Do you think I could sleep?

325
00:28:52.606 --> 00:28:53.607 line:80%
Flavorful.

326
00:29:01.824 --> 00:29:02.700 line:80%
Mr. Kim.

327
00:29:03.784 --> 00:29:05.953 line:80%
Are you really going to take her out?

328
00:29:07.204 --> 00:29:09.707 line:80%
Why? You can't do it without her?

329
00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:13.169 line:80%
She proposed it. Taking her out is...

330
00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:16.088 line:80%
She wasn't wrong either.

331
00:29:16.172 --> 00:29:18.340 line:80%
Even in my humble opinion,

332
00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:21.886 line:80%
we shouldn't just change the packaging.

333
00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:24.054 line:80%
-Who says we'll do that?
-Pardon?

334
00:29:25.306 --> 00:29:28.934 line:80%
We'll have to simplify the process,
but we can't do that.

335
00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:31.520 line:80%
It'll be a proper meal kit.

336
00:29:32.438 --> 00:29:36.066 line:80%
Pick out good restaurants first.
Places people know of.

337
00:29:39.278 --> 00:29:40.321 line:80%
But earlier--

338
00:29:40.404 --> 00:29:42.698 line:80%
Director Wang will support this.

339
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.867 line:80%
But there are too many names on it.

340
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.328 line:80%
The director's name has to be added too.

341
00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:52.333 line:80%
So that was intentional?

342
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:54.585 line:80%
Yes, it was.

343
00:29:57.505 --> 00:30:01.842 line:80%
Meals are all similar anyway, so find
restaurants that know the business.

344
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.012 line:80%
Find those with pretty faces if you could.

345
00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:14.396 line:80%
Focus. Shall I take you out instead?

346
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:17.358 line:80%
If it weren't for me,

347
00:30:18.651 --> 00:30:22.196 line:80%
who would get promoted for this?
You or Kang Ji-won?

348
00:30:34.375 --> 00:30:37.336 line:80%
I'm determined to fight, but how?

349
00:30:41.423 --> 00:30:43.551 line:80%
CREDIT CARD APPROVED
340,000 WON

350
00:30:43.634 --> 00:30:46.929 line:80%
340,000 WON

351
00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:49.014 line:80%
They spent 340,000 won?

352
00:30:49.557 --> 00:30:51.016 line:80%
What...

353
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.268 line:80%
Is he crazy?

354
00:30:55.938 --> 00:30:59.567 line:80%
I lived a terrible life
because I didn't know how to fight.

355
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.318 line:80%
I can just learn how.

356
00:31:01.402 --> 00:31:05.781 line:80%
I have to stop letting shameless people
take things from me.

357
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:06.907 line:80%
No.

358
00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:12.746 line:80%
I won't let anyone take anything
from me this time.

359
00:31:16.709 --> 00:31:21.088 line:80%
He didn't go behind your back
and come straight to me.

360
00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:24.675 line:80%
Mr. Kim is a distant cousin.

361
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:28.554 line:80%
He's a good worker,
but he's been so unlucky.

362
00:31:30.598 --> 00:31:34.018 line:80%
But he told me a good idea this time.

363
00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:36.270 line:80%
I'm planning a meal kit proposal.

364
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:40.691 line:80%
I'm not supporting him
because he's a cousin.

365
00:31:40.774 --> 00:31:44.028 line:80%
I checked with the development team,
and it's good.

366
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:45.654 line:80%
Proceed with it.

367
00:31:45.738 --> 00:31:48.073 line:80%
Speaking of which,

368
00:31:48.157 --> 00:31:50.909 line:80%
you're so tight
with performance evaluation.

369
00:31:50.993 --> 00:31:55.789 line:80%
A leader should know
how to nurture subordinates.

370
00:31:55.873 --> 00:31:59.084 line:80%
If water is too clear, fish can't live.

371
00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:03.464 line:80%
He's been in that position for too long.

372
00:32:03.547 --> 00:32:04.715 line:80%
Think of his age.

373
00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:09.219 line:80%
I'll look into it.

374
00:32:09.303 --> 00:32:10.846 line:80%
Yeah, okay. Do that.

375
00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:13.515 line:80%
Work hard.

376
00:32:17.019 --> 00:32:18.979 line:80%
Why is he so stiff all the time?

377
00:32:19.063 --> 00:32:22.566 line:80%
So what if he's a Yu?
Is he related to the chairman or what?

378
00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:35.871 line:80%
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

379
00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:42.044 line:80%
What happened
to the proposal you told me about?

380
00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.425 line:80%
I'M WORKING HARD ON IT. THANK YOU.

381
00:32:53.097 --> 00:32:55.307 line:80%
He's more keen than he looks.

382
00:32:56.392 --> 00:32:57.434 line:80%
I like you a lot.

383
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.314 line:80%
But I have to do it on my own.

384
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:07.736 line:80%
Do you have plans tonight?

385
00:33:16.578 --> 00:33:19.832 line:80%
I HAVE TO WORK UNTIL LATE TONIGHT.

386
00:33:22.793 --> 00:33:25.254 line:80%
It's more important, so make time.

387
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:34.221 line:80%
This isn't a date. Don't worry.

388
00:33:50.738 --> 00:33:52.656 line:80%
Can you tell me what it's about?

389
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.742 line:80%
I don't think you'll ask for help.

390
00:33:56.285 --> 00:33:57.828 line:80%
I just want to be helpful.

391
00:33:59.163 --> 00:34:01.540 line:80%
-Mr. Yu, I--
-There's no price.

392
00:34:04.585 --> 00:34:07.880 line:80%
It's uncomfortable when you act this way.

393
00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:10.257 line:80%
Why? Do you want there to be a price?

394
00:34:14.136 --> 00:34:16.638 line:80%
How about just accepting it? A free favor.

395
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:20.517 line:80%
I don't want to be repaid
for what I do willingly.

396
00:34:21.268 --> 00:34:24.062 line:80%
It's not easy to meet someone like me.

397
00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:27.024 line:80%
-However--
-If that's uncomfortable too,

398
00:34:28.108 --> 00:34:29.359 line:80%
this is as your boss.

399
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.059 line:80%
Hey, Ji-hyuk!

400
00:35:02.893 --> 00:35:04.061 line:80%
Hello!

401
00:35:04.978 --> 00:35:06.647 line:80%
You're still so beautiful.

402
00:35:07.564 --> 00:35:09.274 line:80%
Have we met before?

403
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:15.697 line:80%
He's like this with any pretty woman.
Hi, I'm Kim Sin-u. This is Jo Dong-suk.

404
00:35:15.781 --> 00:35:17.032 line:80%
Yes, hello.

405
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.200 line:80%
Hello.

406
00:35:19.993 --> 00:35:21.245 line:80%
Friends from college.

407
00:35:21.662 --> 00:35:23.163 line:80%
By any chance, do you like judo?

408
00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:26.875 line:80%
I was on the national team as a reserve.

409
00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:29.795 line:80%
For Taekwondo, I mean.
But I'm good at judo too.

410
00:35:29.878 --> 00:35:31.088 line:80%
I see.

411
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.342 line:80%
-What's going on?
-Here.

412
00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:36.260 line:80%
KANG JI-WON

413
00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.056 line:80%
What is this?

414
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:42.891 line:80%
Go change.

415
00:35:46.436 --> 00:35:47.646 line:80%
Into this?

416
00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:56.196 line:80%
Just as you saw,
flip your opponent with one go.

417
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.533 line:80%
Judo is all about physics.
Think of it as a lever.

418
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:00.993 line:80%
Grab and flip.

419
00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:02.536 line:80%
-Grab and flip.
-Yes.

420
00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:04.621 line:80%
Do you want to try?

421
00:36:04.705 --> 00:36:05.998 line:80%
Oh, right.

422
00:36:08.292 --> 00:36:09.626 line:80%
Grab.

423
00:36:10.127 --> 00:36:11.628 line:80%
-Grab. That's good.
-Grab.

424
00:36:11.712 --> 00:36:13.297 line:80%
Position your foot.

425
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.756 line:80%
Flip!

426
00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:17.843 line:80%
-Flip!
-Flip...

427
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:22.764 line:80%
-Why won't you flip?
-And flip!

428
00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:26.435 line:80%
Now, scream louder.

429
00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:30.314 line:80%
Again!

430
00:36:31.732 --> 00:36:33.025 line:80%
One more time!

431
00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:53.003 line:80%
With all your strength!

432
00:37:02.471 --> 00:37:04.598 line:80%
You did it! You really did it!

433
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:07.059 line:80%
-You did it!
-I flipped you!

434
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:09.394 line:80%
You really did it! You did it.

435
00:37:10.604 --> 00:37:13.941 line:80%
That covers the basics.
Let's do the practical part.

436
00:37:15.817 --> 00:37:17.235 line:80%
Practical part?

437
00:37:21.365 --> 00:37:23.200 line:80%
The first step to win

438
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.286 line:80%
is to get on the mat
and face your opponent.

439
00:37:28.372 --> 00:37:29.831 line:80%
This is how to fight.

440
00:37:32.209 --> 00:37:33.210 line:80%
Grab me.

441
00:37:39.007 --> 00:37:40.842 line:80%
It's not easy to grab someone.

442
00:37:41.677 --> 00:37:42.719 line:80%
However,

443
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.640 line:80%
at times they yield.

444
00:37:54.523 --> 00:37:56.316 line:80%
They know you can't flip them.

445
00:38:06.076 --> 00:38:08.286 line:80%
I will flip you.

446
00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:11.957 line:80%
If you're not sure, don't get on the mat.

447
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.835 line:80%
Once you're on the mat,
focus on one thing only.

448
00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:17.838 line:80%
"I will flip."

449
00:38:19.381 --> 00:38:20.757 line:80%
I will flip.

450
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:23.051 line:80%
Grab him properly!

451
00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:28.974 line:80%
-Shout!
-Shout!

452
00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:51.288 line:80%
Judo is all about push and pull.

453
00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.625 line:80%
Use your opponent's strength
when you're not strong enough.

454
00:38:58.086 --> 00:38:59.463 line:80%
Of course,

455
00:38:59.546 --> 00:39:01.923 line:80%
I think it's okay to not fight directly.

456
00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:04.801 line:80%
Ask for help.

457
00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:09.806 line:80%
Ask someone who can fight for you.
Someone like me.

458
00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:39.419 line:80%
I did it! I really did it!

459
00:39:39.503 --> 00:39:40.754 line:80%
I did it!

460
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.423 line:80%
I did it!

461
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:48.011 line:80%
You doubted me, didn't you?

462
00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:51.515 line:80%
You had your guard down a little, right?

463
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:15.872 line:80%
Good job.

464
00:40:38.895 --> 00:40:41.857 line:80%
Didn't he tell me not to go easy on her?

465
00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:45.402 line:80%
-Didn't he flip too easily just now?
-Yes.

466
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:47.154 line:80%
He even jumped in the air.

467
00:40:47.237 --> 00:40:48.822 line:80%
He jumped so high.

468
00:41:04.713 --> 00:41:06.548 line:80%
Thank you for tonight.

469
00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:08.008 line:80%
Don't forget to shout.

470
00:41:08.091 --> 00:41:10.302 line:80%
You're capable of fighting well.

471
00:41:12.012 --> 00:41:13.263 line:80%
Like a gamecock?

472
00:41:14.598 --> 00:41:17.017 line:80%
The most righteous gamecock in the world.

473
00:41:19.853 --> 00:41:22.647 line:80%
Once you're on the mat,
focus on one thing only.

474
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.240 line:80%
What are you doing, Ms. Kim?
How's your performance?

475
00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:37.287 line:80%
You can get fired over performance.

476
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.999 line:80%
First, get on the mat
and face my opponent.

477
00:41:51.218 --> 00:41:53.678 line:80%
I reflected on the points you made,

478
00:41:53.762 --> 00:41:55.430 line:80%
and I redid the proposal.

479
00:42:03.647 --> 00:42:04.981 line:80%
Also, about yesterday,

480
00:42:06.316 --> 00:42:07.525 line:80%
I apologize.

481
00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.127 line:80%
This is mine.

482
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:31.132 line:80%
I'm giving you this because you seem
to think no one else thought of it.

483
00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:36.263 line:80%
PROPOSERS:
KIM GYEONG-UK, YANG JU-RAN, JEONG SU-MIN

484
00:42:38.014 --> 00:42:40.141 line:80%
What? Is it because your name's missing?

485
00:42:40.225 --> 00:42:42.185 line:80%
Isn't it natural?

486
00:42:42.269 --> 00:42:43.687 line:80%
It was originally mine,

487
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:48.566 line:80%
but now the director will move it forward.
There's no room for your name.

488
00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:56.700 line:80%
Mr. Kim, can you give me a chance?

489
00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:00.245 line:80%
Really?

490
00:43:01.788 --> 00:43:03.206 line:80%
Then...

491
00:43:04.457 --> 00:43:07.002 line:80%
Integrate what you edited
and bring it back.

492
00:43:07.085 --> 00:43:09.796 line:80%
Whether I'll add your name or not,

493
00:43:09.879 --> 00:43:11.673 line:80%
I'll decide then.

494
00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:14.009 line:80%
Yes, sir.

495
00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:22.267 line:80%
I'm sorry

496
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:26.313 line:80%
You helped me a lot,
but the situation is bad.

497
00:43:26.396 --> 00:43:27.480 line:80%
I'm really sorry.

498
00:43:29.316 --> 00:43:32.694 line:80%
So Jeong Su-min's name has to be on it?

499
00:43:34.154 --> 00:43:37.991 line:80%
He's even threatening
to take your name out of it.

500
00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:39.617 line:80%
Thanks for thinking of me.

501
00:43:41.453 --> 00:43:42.537 line:80%
Eat up.

502
00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:55.258 line:80%
How is it?

503
00:43:56.885 --> 00:43:58.053 line:80%
It's as if...

504
00:43:58.136 --> 00:43:59.888 line:80%
this Basque cheesecake is made

505
00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:05.018 line:80%
with the fresh milk from a mountain goat
in New Zealand that just gave birth.

506
00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:06.102 line:80%
What?

507
00:44:06.186 --> 00:44:07.604 line:80%
Where did you buy this?

508
00:44:10.106 --> 00:44:11.399 line:80%
Werther?

509
00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:14.486 line:80%
My friend runs the restaurant.

510
00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:17.655 line:80%
Speak of the devil.

511
00:44:18.615 --> 00:44:20.116 line:80%
-Shall I take it?
-Yeah.

512
00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:24.996 line:80%
Hello?

513
00:44:26.206 --> 00:44:27.665 line:80%
Did you get the cake?

514
00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:31.795 line:80%
Yeah, I'm eating it with a coworker.

515
00:44:31.878 --> 00:44:34.714 line:80%
Who's the person
that sent such a great cake?

516
00:44:34.798 --> 00:44:37.133 line:80%
This is love itself!

517
00:44:37.217 --> 00:44:39.552 line:80%
What?

518
00:44:39.636 --> 00:44:41.638 line:80%
-It means it's good.
-
Really?

519
00:44:41.721 --> 00:44:44.766 line:80%
I'm glad. I made it myself.

520
00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:46.726 line:80%
You did?

521
00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.145 line:80%
-You bake too?
-
Yeah.

522
00:44:49.229 --> 00:44:52.857 line:80%
I make the desserts
for important people myself.

523
00:44:54.567 --> 00:44:55.777 line:80%
Enjoy it.

524
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.237 line:80%
Thanks, I'll enjoy it.

525
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:02.784 line:80%
My savior.

526
00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:05.954 line:80%
Are you dating him?

527
00:45:07.163 --> 00:45:08.081 line:80%
No.

528
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.419 line:80%
What are you talking about?
I have a boyfriend.

529
00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.213 line:80%
That's right.

530
00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:19.592 line:80%
Then I'm positive this friend likes you.

531
00:45:19.676 --> 00:45:23.179 line:80%
It's not easy to send a cake like this
if he doesn't.

532
00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:29.018 line:80%
Speaking of which,
will you proceed it as Mr. Kim said?

533
00:45:31.438 --> 00:45:34.315 line:80%
I was a fool for losing my temper.

534
00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:37.694 line:80%
He never planned on doing as he said.

535
00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.029 line:80%
What?

536
00:45:40.113 --> 00:45:45.034 line:80%
The proposal he gave me
only had a few words different from mine.

537
00:45:45.118 --> 00:45:46.828 line:80%
Unbelievable.

538
00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:50.498 line:80%
So he was just trying
to get you off of it?

539
00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:57.005 line:80%
Wow, he's the worst.
How can he work with that terrible mind?

540
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:59.716 line:80%
How can you stand looking at him?

541
00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:02.760 line:80%
Did you know judo is about push and pull?

542
00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:08.224 line:80%
Mr. Kim underestimated me.

543
00:46:08.308 --> 00:46:10.560 line:80%
So he yielded his sleeve to me.

544
00:46:12.187 --> 00:46:14.147 line:80%
He didn't think I could flip him.

545
00:46:15.815 --> 00:46:17.734 line:80%
Judo? All of a sudden?

546
00:46:24.073 --> 00:46:26.743 line:80%
I don't want to imagine him in a uniform.

547
00:46:29.579 --> 00:46:34.876 line:80%
Judo seems like a good sport.
You feel different when you shout too.

548
00:46:35.502 --> 00:46:38.922 line:80%
Shouting? I know it all too well!

549
00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:41.549 line:80%
It's nothing, but things change after it.

550
00:46:46.346 --> 00:46:48.598 line:80%
Sorry about that! I'm sorry!

551
00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:50.225 line:80%
-Sorry.
-Sorry about that.

552
00:46:54.062 --> 00:46:56.105 line:80%
But where's Ms. Yang?

553
00:47:03.696 --> 00:47:07.659 line:80%
This must be uncomfortable for you.

554
00:47:07.742 --> 00:47:11.788 line:80%
You didn't do it on purpose,
but because of Mr. Kim's decision...

555
00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:17.585 line:80%
Being a good worker
can be a headache sometimes, right?

556
00:47:18.086 --> 00:47:20.171 line:80%
It's not because I'm a good worker.

557
00:47:20.255 --> 00:47:22.799 line:80%
I really love Ji-won so much,

558
00:47:23.716 --> 00:47:27.095 line:80%
but a person should be reasonable at work.

559
00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:31.766 line:80%
Don't worry about it.
You didn't do anything wrong.

560
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:35.436 line:80%
Ji-won is great,

561
00:47:36.145 --> 00:47:38.648 line:80%
but she's not flexible and so upright.

562
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:43.319 line:80%
What can we do about it?
That's why she got into Hankuk University.

563
00:47:43.403 --> 00:47:45.363 line:80%
We should just accept her for it.

564
00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:49.033 line:80%
You really are a good friend.

565
00:47:52.912 --> 00:47:56.416 line:80%
I can be a good friend
to you too, Ms. Yang.

566
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:03.006 line:80%
I'm not as smart as Ji-won. I'm a dummy.

567
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:07.802 line:80%
If you do well, I'll do well too.

568
00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:09.846 line:80%
That's what I think.

569
00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:14.434 line:80%
You're not a dummy.

570
00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:16.519 line:80%
You're good at work and so clever.

571
00:48:17.645 --> 00:48:20.940 line:80%
And that's the right way.
Work should be done together.

572
00:48:21.024 --> 00:48:23.484 line:80%
-Especially company work.
-Right?

573
00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:27.864 line:80%
Let's work really hard on this project.

00:48:56.351 --> 00:48:57.977 line:80%
How dare you?

579
00:48:58.061 --> 00:49:02.231 line:80%
Let go of me! I'm warning you! Let go!

580
00:49:03.483 --> 00:49:06.152 line:80%
I've grabbed Mr. Kim's sleeve.

581
00:49:06.235 --> 00:49:09.238 line:80%
The problem is, how do I flip him?

582
00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:11.491 line:80%
Ji-won?

583
00:49:11.574 --> 00:49:12.825 line:80%
We bought snacks.

584
00:49:26.214 --> 00:49:29.676 line:80%
The flower is just for Ji-won.
You're the flower of our team.

585
00:49:30.635 --> 00:49:32.178 line:80%
And for Hui-yeon and Min-hwan.

586
00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.930 line:80%
Thanks.

587
00:49:35.348 --> 00:49:38.434 line:80%
Su-min really looks after you a lot.

588
00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:39.852 line:80%
Yeah.

589
00:49:44.232 --> 00:49:45.316 line:80%
Well...

590
00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:48.528 line:80%
When will you be done with the proposal?

591
00:49:49.696 --> 00:49:52.156 line:80%
Before it's shown to Mr. Kim,

592
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.117 line:80%
it'd be nice if you share it.

593
00:49:55.326 --> 00:49:56.452 line:80%
With me...

594
00:49:58.621 --> 00:49:59.664 line:80%
and Su-min.

595
00:50:02.417 --> 00:50:06.337 line:80%
Well, if there's anything new. You know?

596
00:50:11.217 --> 00:50:14.220 line:80%
Actually, I thought about
the marketing strategy.

597
00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:17.682 line:80%
I'll share them right away.

598
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:22.103 line:80%
It'd be good to use
Director Wang's name to promote it.

Director Wang!

618
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:03.830 line:80%
Did you call me?

619
00:52:03.913 --> 00:52:05.915 line:80%
Who is this?

620
00:52:05.998 --> 00:52:08.543 line:80%
Manager Kim... No.

621
00:52:08.626 --> 00:52:10.962 line:80%
Deputy General Manager Kim!

622
00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:13.714 line:80%
Director Wang!

623
00:52:13.798 --> 00:52:16.008 line:80%
I'm so proud of you!

624
00:52:16.092 --> 00:52:19.554 line:80%
Who thought of putting my name
on it like that?

625
00:52:21.222 --> 00:52:23.975 line:80%
For marketing, we need a star
to gain attention fast.

626
00:52:24.058 --> 00:52:27.937 line:80%
Instead of using a celebrity,
we need a trustworthy expert.

627
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:32.608 line:80%
And I think Director Wang Heung-in
will be a trustworthy face.

628
00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:35.862 line:80%
Of course, it was my idea!

629
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:39.156 line:80%
You're handsome and competent!
You're U&K's icon!

630
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.409 line:80%
There's no one better than you!

631
00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:43.536 line:80%
Great job!

632
00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:44.871 line:80%
Make this big.

633
00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:47.832 line:80%
I leave the country tomorrow.

634
00:52:48.457 --> 00:52:49.292 line:80%
You are?

635
00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:52.837 line:80%
Ji-hyuk got his position
because of his work in the States.

636
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.631 line:80%
I was going to try next year,

637
00:52:55.715 --> 00:52:57.884 line:80%
but I got a good feeling about this.

638
00:52:58.634 --> 00:53:02.346 line:80%
Don't be satisfied with being the first.
We must keep pushing.

639
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.557 line:80%
Until we're the only one left!

640
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.893 line:80%
I'll push ruthlessly!

641
00:53:06.976 --> 00:53:08.936 line:80%
Do a good job.

642
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.439 line:80%
I'll be supporting you. Do what you want.

643
00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:13.190 line:80%
Yes, sir.

644
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.569 line:80%
Good. This is great!

U&K EXECUTIVE BUSINESS TRIP NOTICE

646
00:53:31.292 --> 00:53:34.670 line:80%
Finally, Wang Heung-in goes
on his business trip tomorrow.

647
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:40.760 line:80%
What are you doing?

648
00:53:41.677 --> 00:53:43.137 line:80%
You haven't left yet?

649
00:53:45.389 --> 00:53:46.974 line:80%
We bought chicken.

650
00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:55.733 line:80%
You work so hard lately.
It's been so long since we all hung out.

651
00:53:55.816 --> 00:53:58.027 line:80%
It's hard for me to see her too.

652
00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:02.490 line:80%
You should just let it go.

653
00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:05.785 line:80%
It's a bus that has already left.
Stop chasing it.

654
00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:10.206 line:80%
Min-hwan, she's just working hard.

655
00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:15.503 line:80%
It might not be now,
but I'm sure it'll be helpful one day.

656
00:54:16.045 --> 00:54:17.046 line:80%
Lately,

657
00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:19.256 line:80%
I've come to hate it.

658
00:54:19.882 --> 00:54:20.883 line:80%
What?

659
00:54:22.134 --> 00:54:24.428 line:80%
That it might be good for me one day.

660
00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:28.808 line:80%
I want to be rewarded
for the work I do now.

661
00:54:31.143 --> 00:54:32.186 line:80%
What the hell?

662
00:54:33.938 --> 00:54:35.940 line:80%
You sound like you're possessed.

663
00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:37.984 line:80%
Did you understand her?

664
00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:41.070 line:80%
Let's just eat chicken.

665
00:54:42.113 --> 00:54:44.949 line:80%
Min-hwan bought this,
so I'll buy the next round!

666
00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:51.455 line:80%
It's soy sauce chicken. Your favorite.

667
00:54:52.581 --> 00:54:53.958 line:80%
You're right.

668
00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:58.879 line:80%
It's such a shame.
I have a meeting outside today.

669
00:55:00.047 --> 00:55:01.382 line:80%
You should've told me.

670
00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:03.968 line:80%
Then you should've told us sooner.

671
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:05.511 line:80%
Come on.

672
00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:08.931 line:80%
It's such a shame.

673
00:55:09.015 --> 00:55:11.517 line:80%
I love eating chicken at night.

674
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.730 line:80%
Min-hwan, do you remember? We ate chicken
while seeing the night view.

675
00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:17.231 line:80%
The mood was great then.

676
00:55:17.732 --> 00:55:19.275 line:80%
That was nice.

677
00:55:19.358 --> 00:55:20.693 line:80%
It tasted so good!

678
00:55:21.944 --> 00:55:23.154 line:80%
Really?

679
00:55:24.697 --> 00:55:26.949 line:80%
-I want to try it too.
-Yeah, sure.

680
00:55:27.033 --> 00:55:31.037 line:80%
You should do that tonight.
I'm late, so I'll get going now.

681
00:55:31.537 --> 00:55:33.664 line:80%
I'm so disappointed, but enjoy!

682
00:55:33.748 --> 00:55:36.083 line:80%
But... Wait, Ji-won.

683
00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:37.960 line:80%
-Are you really going?
-Ji-won?

684
00:56:00.858 --> 00:56:01.859 line:80%
Who is it?

685
00:56:01.942 --> 00:56:03.569 line:80%
Hello, Director Wang.

686
00:56:03.652 --> 00:56:06.906 line:80%
We met at the NurTV Showcase.

687
00:56:06.989 --> 00:56:08.324 line:80%
I'm Kang Ji-won.

688
00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:09.366 line:80%
What?

689
00:56:10.618 --> 00:56:12.787 line:80%
Wait, is she insane?

690
00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:15.956 line:80%
How did someone like you get my number?

691
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:20.461 line:80%
As you know, the meal kit business
you're doing was originally mine.

692
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.590 line:80%
And I'm going to complain
about being left out of it.

693
00:56:27.676 --> 00:56:28.886 line:80%
Hey, hang up!

694
00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:36.102 line:80%
I did my best to flip them over.

695
00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:40.898 line:80%
So flip!

696
00:56:42.149 --> 00:56:45.361 line:80%
You're going to go down anyway,
so go down now! Please!

697
00:56:53.327 --> 00:56:55.204 line:80%
Hey, come here.

698
00:57:01.252 --> 00:57:03.254 line:80%
I'm pissed as it is. What is this?

699
00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:06.966 line:80%
Why is there someone sitting beside me?

700
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:12.388 line:80%
This is the seat you booked.
Is there a problem?

701
00:57:13.264 --> 00:57:15.599 line:80%
Do you not know who I am?

702
00:57:15.683 --> 00:57:19.770 line:80%
Why is there someone sitting beside me?

703
00:57:22.523 --> 00:57:24.400 line:80%
Are you ignoring me now?

704
00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:26.652 line:80%
I don't believe this. Seriously?

705
00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:31.657 line:80%
This evil little assistant manager thinks
the proposal is hers because she wrote it.

706
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.326 line:80%
Now a mere flight attendant
is ignoring me?

707
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:39.331 line:80%
Think about why you get paid.

708
00:57:39.957 --> 00:57:42.543 line:80%
Then you'd know what you should say.

709
00:57:45.045 --> 00:57:47.214 line:80%
Shall I check if there's an empty seat?

710
00:57:47.882 --> 00:57:51.093 line:80%
No one does their job properly.

711
00:57:51.177 --> 00:57:53.179 line:80%
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

712
00:57:55.389 --> 00:57:56.557 line:80%
MANAGER KIM GYEONG-UK

713
00:58:00.936 --> 00:58:01.770 line:80%
Mr. Kim?

714
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:06.442 line:80%
Did you not take care of Kang Ji-won,
who wrote the proposal?

715
00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:10.487 line:80%
What? She's still working on it?

716
00:58:11.614 --> 00:58:17.036 line:80%
So that's why she went on about
making a complaint about it.

717
00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:19.121 line:80%
What? She called you?

718
00:58:19.205 --> 00:58:22.541 line:80%
Yes, she said she'd make an issue
of leaving her out.

719
00:58:22.625 --> 00:58:25.419 line:80%
Tear that clueless thing to pieces!

720
00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:27.296 line:80%
God, it's pissing me off.

721
00:58:28.339 --> 00:58:31.300 line:80%
What on earth is he doing on a plane?

722
00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:33.928 line:80%
What's wrong with him?

723
00:58:41.936 --> 00:58:44.271 line:80%
Hey, you. Come here.

724
00:58:48.817 --> 00:58:51.320 line:80%
-Did you laugh earlier?
-Excuse me?

725
00:58:51.403 --> 00:58:55.282 line:80%
You laughed while I was on the phone.
Are you looking down on me?

726
00:58:56.325 --> 00:58:59.036 line:80%
I'm sorry, Director.
I'll educate her again.

727
00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:01.038 line:80%
And I'll serve you myself.

728
00:59:07.044 --> 00:59:08.879 line:80%
You should've done so earlier.

729
00:59:08.963 --> 00:59:13.133 line:80%
Director? Your seat must be upright
for takeoff.

730
00:59:13.217 --> 00:59:15.052 line:80%
Please put your seatbelt on...

731
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:18.555 line:80%
Are you joking?

732
00:59:19.348 --> 00:59:21.308 line:80%
This won't do.

733
00:59:21.392 --> 00:59:22.643 line:80%
Hey.

734
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.396 line:80%
Bring someone higher than you.

735
00:59:26.981 --> 00:59:31.652 line:80%
I'm the manager of business class.
And assaulting a crew member is illegal--

736
00:59:32.903 --> 00:59:35.990 line:80%
Assault? What do you mean?
I just tapped you.

737
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:38.409 line:80%
Sir, assaulting a crew member...

738
00:59:38.492 --> 00:59:40.035 line:80%
Why you...

739
00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:43.747 line:80%
I was just holding this,
and you bumped into it.

740
00:59:43.831 --> 00:59:45.374 line:80%
Right?

741
00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:48.711 line:80%
How dare you do this to me?

742
00:59:48.794 --> 00:59:50.879 line:80%
What are you looking at?

743
00:59:51.463 --> 00:59:54.717 line:80%
He's assaulting a crew member?
Unbelievable.

744
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.510 line:80%
He's famous for being nice.

745
00:59:57.678 --> 01:00:01.098 line:80%
Executive A of U&K Food,
who caused a commotion on a plane

746
01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:04.351 line:80%
that is known
as the Mole Director Incident,

747
01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:05.853 line:80%
was dismissed today.

748
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:11.066 line:80%
He had appeared on a variety show
and built an amicable reputation.

749
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:15.404 line:80%
The action was taken a week after
his video was posted on social media.

750
01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:25.122 line:80%
U&K DIRECTOR ASSAULTS CREW
VIDEOS SPREAD, REPORT LEAKED

751
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.458 line:80%
U&K EXECUTIVE DISMISSED AFTER ASSAULT

752
01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.502 line:80%
U&K FIRES EXECUTIVE A
AFTER HIS CLIP CAUSED A STIR

753
01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:32.671 line:80%
ALL PRODUCTS TO BE DISPOSED

754
01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:40.054 line:80%
CAUGHT SAYING,
"TEAR KANG JI-WON INTO PIECES!"

755
01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.930 line:80%
KANG JI-WON

756
01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:44.641 line:80%
WANG HEUNG-IN'S SPECIAL PROPOSAL
FINAL REPORT

757
01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:48.395 line:80%
PROPOSERS:
KIM GYEONG-UK, YANG JU-RAN, JEONG SU-MIN

758
01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:55.736 line:80%
Executive A was the model
of U&K's meal kit product commercial.

759
01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:59.073 line:80%
As many people are
boycotting the products,

760
01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.451 line:80%
U&K Group has posted an apology

761
01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:05.329 line:80%
and announced
they'd dispose of all products

762
01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:07.498 line:80%
with the executive's face on them.

763
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:11.126 line:80%
Did you not take care of Kang Ji-won,
who wrote the proposal?

764
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.252 line:80%
Let go of me!

765
01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:16.340 line:80%
Let go of me! I'm warning you! Let go!

766
01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:19.760 line:80%
Hey! How dare you touch me?

767
01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.011 line:80%
Let go of me!

768
01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:24.640 line:80%
So this is when U&K's power-tripping mole
was still here.

769
01:01:25.808 --> 01:01:29.395 line:80%
It'd be good to use
Director Wang's name to promote it.

770
01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:31.480 line:80%
You'll all get fired!

771
01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:04.513 line:80%
Oh, my God!

772
01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:10.894 line:80%
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

773
01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:14.356 line:80%
No, it's fine.

774
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:16.942 line:80%
I came to tell you something.

775
01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:21.238 line:80%
Director Wang will be dismissed.

776
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:25.868 line:80%
And Mr. Kim will be disciplined
for stealing your proposal.

777
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.165 line:80%
Great job.

778
01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:43.427 line:80%
Well, then.

779
01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.096 line:80%
Wait, Mr. Yu!

780
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.280 line:80%
BTS? I like them too.

781
01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:07.868 line:80%
To be honest,
I want to listen to "Dynamite" right now,

782
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.536 line:80%
but I can't find it.

783
01:03:10.496 --> 01:03:13.290 line:80%
"Dynamite" is great.
I like "Spring Day," though.

784
01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:15.250 line:80%
I like "Spring Day" too.

785
01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.304 line:80%
That's...

786
01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:29.973 line:80%
a replica brand.

787
01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:32.518 line:80%
People who know can tell.

788
01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:34.603 line:80%
But just try it this time. You can go.

789
01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:37.356 line:80%
He's the one that told me
about the reunion.

790
01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:40.317 line:80%
Oh, right. Does your stomach hurt?

791
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.570 line:80%
I'm worried Mr. Park might hurt you.

792
01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:45.322 line:80%
People don't change.

793
01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.575 line:80%
They repeat their actions.

794
01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:01.380 line:80%
"Spring Day"?

795
01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:09.429 line:80%
Did you say "Dynamite"?

796
01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:22.109 line:80%
"DYNAMITE"
RELEASED IN 2020

797
01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:36.039 line:80%
"SPRING DAY"
RELEASED IN 2017

798
01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:44.548 line:80%
CURRENTLY JULY 10, 2013

799
01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:03.358 line:80%
Either way, the inevitable will happen.

800
01:05:03.442 --> 01:05:04.693 line:80%
I won't run away.

801
01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:07.404 line:80%
My time already ended then.

802
01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:09.823 line:80%

You left work together,

803
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.743 line:80%
and you went to your house.
Was that overtime?

804
01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:14.369 line:80%
I'll help with everything.

805
01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:16.955 line:80%
Ji-won, well? How does it feel to have me?

806
01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:20.375 line:80%
I'll do what I can to get
what I want by any means.

807
01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.586 line:80%
That's what it means to want it.

808
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.254 line:80%
You're more qualified.

809
01:05:26.006 --> 01:05:28.592 line:80%
You'll still be alive in ten years.
