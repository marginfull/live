00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.300 line:82%
How did you move into this apartment?

2
00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.700 line:82%
A friend of mine moved in first
and recommended that I come visit.

3
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.333 line:82%
The new apartment was very clean.

4
00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.266 line:82%
There was a school nearby,

5
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.300 line:82%
so I moved for my children's education.

6
00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:41.200 line:82%
I see.

7
00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:44.633 line:82%
There aren't any kids who transfer out.

8
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.333 line:82%
But many kids transfer in.

9
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.867 line:82%
APARTMENTS ARE RUSHING IN

10
00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.900 line:82%
While the original plan was to accept
the applications until the 27th,

11
00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:57.900 line:82%
the application period ended today
as the number of applications exceeded

12
00:00:57.967 --> 00:00:59.500 line:82%
the 2,634 available units.

13
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.867 line:82%
If you foster property speculation,

14
00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:05.967 line:82%
how are people supposed to live?

15
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.667 line:82%
At the underground parking lot
of an apartment in Seoul this morning,

16
00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.133 line:82%
a man in his sixties was found dead.

17
00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.633 line:82%
Is this a murder case?

18
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.900 line:82%
My gosh.

19
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.900 line:82%
Come on! Don't do that!

20
00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:32.333 line:82%
Gosh, you startled me!

21
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.734 line:82%
-What?
-What?

22
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.166 line:82%
-Why would you go that far?
-Why would you do that?

23
00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:42.266 line:82%
It's too realistic.

24
00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.600 line:82%
Lightning power!

25
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.433 line:82%
I feel like I'm going to die.

26
00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:10.133 line:82%
What should I do?

27
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.300 line:82%
JENNIE, hello.

28
00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:19.633 line:82%
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

29
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.133 line:82%
JENNIE, how have you been?

30
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.867 line:82%
I really missed you.

31
00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.133 line:82%
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

32
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.333 line:82%
-Won't you be cold?
-Hello.

33
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.600 line:82%
I wore a T-shirt inside.

34
00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:29.967 line:82%
-Is that so?
-Hello.

35
00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:31.667 line:82%
-Hello.
-You're so awkward.

36
00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:33.233 line:82%
-We haven't met before.
-Hey.

37
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.533 line:82%
-Don't be awkward.
-I hope

38
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.734 line:82%
-we get along.
-Go closer.

39
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.867 line:82%
-Hi.
-She's JENNIE, a superstar.

40
00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.333 line:82%
-She's Na-ra.
-Hello.

41
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.834 line:82%
I asked them to disperse
so that you wouldn't feel pressured.

42
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.000 line:82%
-You'll know when this airs.
-We didn't want to make you nervous.

43
00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.166 line:82%
No, you didn't need to worry.

44
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.433 line:82%
JENNIE is the only one who isn't here.

45
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.967 line:82%
I haven't seen her in a while.

46
00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:55.800 line:82%
-Right.
-It's my first time meeting her.

47
00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:57.667 line:82%
If we wait for her like this…

48
00:02:57.734 --> 00:02:59.367 line:82%
JENNIE will feel pressured.

49
00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:01.834 line:82%
-Go back into your car.
-Disperse.

50
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.967 line:82%
-Don't make her uncomfortable.
-Disperse.

51
00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.133 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Go.

52
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200 line:82%
-I told you so.
-What are you doing?

53
00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.133 line:82%
We didn't want to make you nervous.

54
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.233 line:82%
-By the way, JENNIE…
-Yes?

55
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.734 line:82%
…I am very happy that you joined the show,

56
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.400 line:82%
but why did you agree to join?

57
00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:20.433 line:82%
-Seriously. Ask her that.
-Come here, JENNIE.

58
00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.300 line:82%
-We go back five years.
-Five years?

59
00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:24.900 line:82%
-Yes.
-With the producer.

60
00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:28.266 line:82%
Even back then, she was a star.

61
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.100 line:82%
Now, JENNIE is practically
a walking company.

62
00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:31.200 line:82%
That isn't true.

63
00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:32.834 line:82%
It's true.

64
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.033 line:82%
-Quit after today if you don't like it.
-No.

65
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.266 line:82%
Today, it feels like relatives
gathered around

66
00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:42.533 line:82%
to visit the ancestors' graves.

67
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.667 line:82%
Bong-seok, you look like an idol.

68
00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:46.734 line:82%
-Me?
-He's so skinny.

69
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.934 line:82%
I was surprised when Jung-ha joined.

70
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.834 line:82%
I really wanted to be in this show.

71
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.233 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

72
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.400 line:82%
MOVING

73
00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:00.500 line:82%
Actor Lee Jung-ha.

74
00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:02.200 line:82%
Actor Lee Jung-ha.

75
00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:06.300 line:82%
You played an innocent high schooler,
Kim Bong-seok.

76
00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:09.333 line:82%
You look like an idol.

77
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.100 line:82%
-Me?
-He's so skinny.

78
00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:13.500 line:82%
-Thanks.
-People don't recognize him as Bong-seok.

79
00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.867 line:82%
-I know. I didn't recognize him.
-He lost weight.

80
00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:17.433 line:82%
How much did you gain for the role?

81
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.400 line:82%
I gained about 30 kg.

82
00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.600 line:82%
For the role?

83
00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:22.633 line:82%
How did you gain 30 kg?

84
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.767 line:82%
I ate all sorts of ramyeon.

85
00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:28.367 line:82%
Since he's young,
he can easily gain and lose weight.

86
00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.633 line:82%
-That's right.
-For me, losing weight is hard.

87
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.367 line:82%
It's like that when you're old.

88
00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:35.734 line:82%
It's true. When you're old…

89
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.633 line:82%
-Why are you dressed like that?
-It's about age.

90
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.467 line:82%
-Only I focused on the concept.
-You…

91
00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:43.200 line:82%
Why are you dressed for
Comedy Big League?

92
00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:45.667 line:82%
-Only I…
-You're wearing vinyl pants.

93
00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.367 line:82%
-I'm Seo Tai-ji.
-Seo Tai-ji.

94
00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:52.433 line:82%
What do you think of my style?

95
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.533 line:82%
You look a bit like a thief.

96
00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:57.533 line:82%
I'm Ko So-young.

97
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.133 line:82%
-Ko So-yong.
-Ko So-yong.

98
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.767 line:82%
Yes. You might get sued.

99
00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:04.200 line:82%
Ko So-yong.

100
00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:06.567 line:82%
Ko So-yong.

101
00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:08.000 line:82%
Are you dressed like a student?

102
00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:09.767 line:82%
No, I just wore what they gave me.

103
00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:12.333 line:82%
Isn't it too much?

104
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.333 line:82%
Seriously.

105
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.433 line:82%
-I brought this item.
-Of course.

106
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.767 line:82%
-It completes the style.
-Tinted glasses.

107
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.934 line:82%
You look so lackluster.

108
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.200 line:82%
Jung-ha is an idol.

109
00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:24.467 line:82%
It's the 1998 style.

110
00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.800 line:82%
It's the SECHSKIES style.

111
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.667 line:82%
He does look like a teenage star.

112
00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:31.767 line:82%
-I was born in 1998.
-In 1998.

113
00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:34.500 line:82%
-In 1998? Are you younger than JENNIE?
-Yes.

114
00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:35.633 line:82%
In 1998?

115
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.000 line:82%
Yes, I was born in 1998.

116
00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:55.266 line:82%
What? Where are you going?

117
00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.467 line:82%
There's no place to hide it.

118
00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:04.734 line:82%
I'm in detective mode.

119
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.934 line:82%
I'll turn off the engine a few times.

120
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.667 line:82%
-How should we split up?
-How?

121
00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:12.166 line:82%
Team Actors.

122
00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:14.333 line:82%
-Team Actors, Team Entertainers.
-Team Actors.

123
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.200 line:82%
Team Actors, Team Entertainers. I see.

124
00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:18.066 line:82%
-Team Entertainers.
-I have

125
00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:19.533 line:82%
released many songs.

126
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.266 line:82%
That puts you on Team Singers.

127
00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:22.934 line:82%
I've released a few albums.

128
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.400 line:82%
You want to team up with JENNIE.

129
00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:29.700 line:82%
Gosh, what a smell.

130
00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:31.500 line:82%
It's that old car smell.

131
00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:34.000 line:82%
No more perfume on you

132
00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:36.633 line:82%
This is an actual LeMans.

133
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.900 line:82%
It's incredible.

134
00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:41.900 line:82%
-Shall we get going?
-Shall we go?

135
00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.867 line:82%
I don't know
if he can drive a stick shift.

136
00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:46.800 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

137
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.066 line:82%
This is an actual LeMans.

138
00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:53.200 line:82%
It's fascinating.

139
00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:56.834 line:82%
This is the beginning.

140
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.333 line:82%
The government decided to request

141
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.734 line:82%
for a relief loan from the IMF.

142
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.700 line:82%
Despite showing impressive economic growth
in the past,

143
00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:09.467 line:82%
Korea has entered a painful phase.

144
00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:16.233 line:82%
Although the nation experienced
the pain of mass unemployment last year,

145
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.100 line:82%
the issue shows no signs of improvement.

146
00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:25.967 line:82%
The gold-collecting campaign
continued on with the citizens' support.

147
00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:28.033 line:82%
Three months into the financial crisis,

148
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.600 line:82%
public security
is getting shaken to the core.

149
00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:35.400 line:82%
Theft, assault, and bank robberies
are rampant.

150
00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:38.633 line:82%
Crimes that are tied to livelihood
are skyrocketing.

151
00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:40.533 line:82%
Thus, the government

152
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.567 line:82%
set out to eradicate crimes
that affect livelihood.

153
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.133 line:82%
Does that mean we're in 1998?

154
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.066 line:82%
-
Yes.
-
That's right.

155
00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:04.967 line:82%
-JENNIE, you were born in 1996.
-That's right.

156
00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:06.166 line:82%
She's ten years younger than me.

157
00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:10.967 line:82%
-Wait, does that mean you're 29?
-She's 28. No, she's 26.

158
00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:12.734 line:82%
-I'm 27.
-Your birthday has passed.

159
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.467 line:82%
Yes, my birthday has passed.
My international age is 27.

160
00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:19.200 line:82%
JENNIE, you've become touchy
about your age.

161
00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.066 line:82%
I really don't know what to do.

162
00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:24.633 line:82%
Now that I'm back in Korea
after working abroad,

163
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.734 line:82%
I've become a senior to other idols.

164
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.900 line:82%
-Already? Time passes so quickly.
-Yes.

165
00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:32.633 line:82%
-Yes, it's like that now.
-I can't get used to it.

166
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.000 line:82%
Everyone is seven years younger than me.

167
00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:42.433 line:82%
It's the sound of the antenna retracting.

168
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.834 line:82%
-Really?
-The antenna.

169
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.567 line:82%
For a second, I thought JENNIE farted.

170
00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:48.233 line:82%
I thought, "She's good at variety shows."

171
00:08:48.734 --> 00:08:51.000 line:82%
-It's my first time…
-I guess it's stuck.

172
00:08:51.066 --> 00:08:53.133 line:82%
…seeing a car with an antenna. What?

173
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.166 line:82%
-This is fun.
-What a ruckus.

174
00:08:57.233 --> 00:08:59.300 line:82%
-It's funny.
-What a ruckus.

175
00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.200 line:82%
I'm amazed
that this car is still drivable.

176
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.567 line:82%
Can you guess who I'm supposed to be?

177
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:08.600 line:82%
-You're JENNIE.
-No.

178
00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:10.467 line:82%
-I'm not JENNIE today.
-Who are you?

179
00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:14.100 line:82%
-Who are you?
-I'm Kim Hee-seon from
Tomato
.

180
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.500 line:82%
I thought you looked familiar.

181
00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:19.900 line:82%
Tomato
.

182
00:09:19.967 --> 00:09:21.934 line:82%
That's right. I see the resemblance.

183
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.367 line:82%
-That explains the headband.
-Yes, I wore one.

184
00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:26.700 line:82%
Still, you're just you.

185
00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.934 line:82%
-That's right. You're JENNIE.
-You're JENNIE.

186
00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:30.934 line:82%
Who are you supposed to be?

187
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.633 line:82%
I'm just my younger self.
I was around back then.

188
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.700 line:82%
-You were an obscure celebrity.
-That's right.

189
00:09:36.767 --> 00:09:38.333 line:82%
You were poor and lost.

190
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.567 line:82%
I was a bit lost.

191
00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:41.734 line:82%
In 1998, you had already debuted.

192
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.934 line:82%
I had debuted.

193
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.433 line:82%
-
Garden Balsam School
.
-Back then, I was in…

194
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.700 line:82%

195
00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:51.066 line:82%
GRASSHOPPER HUSBAND

196
00:09:53.266 --> 00:09:54.567 line:82%
Give me a break!

197
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.200 line:82%
Grasshopper Husband
soon got canceled.

198
00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.700 line:82%
It was a skit about a jobless man.

199
00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:07.200 line:82%
-Times were tough.
-Many people lost their jobs.

200
00:10:07.266 --> 00:10:08.734 line:82%
-It ended up reflecting the era.
-Yes.

201
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.066 line:82%
-They said it'd be too painful to watch…
-How sad.

202
00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:14.333 line:82%
-…so the skit got pulled.
-I see.

203
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.700 line:82%
Why is this year the backdrop?

204
00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:18.533 line:82%
-The year of 1998.
-I'm curious.

205
00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:24.133 line:82%
Yes, I got it.

206
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.567 line:82%
I got it!

207
00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:29.300 line:82%
Yes! The engine isn't turning off now.

208
00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:32.133 line:82%
Oh, yes. I got it.

209
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.100 line:82%
Nice. I have a good feeling about this.

210
00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.433 line:82%
I'm set with the second gear.

211
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.367 line:82%
Gosh, I have a cramp in my left foot.

212
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.033 line:82%
It's been a while since

213
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.767 line:82%
-I used a clutch.
-Switch gears when you go uphill.

214
00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:47.133 line:82%
Uphill? I hope there won't be a hill.

215
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.000 line:82%
It would be a disaster.

216
00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:55.433 line:82%
-Is this a hill?
-It's a hill.

217
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.934 line:82%
Press hard.

218
00:10:57.767 --> 00:10:58.700 line:82%
Will the engine turn off?

219
00:10:58.767 --> 00:11:00.800 line:82%
Either that or the car will go backward.

220
00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:02.000 line:82%
-Backward?
-Yes.

221
00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:03.900 line:82%
This is a crucial moment.

222
00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:06.734 line:82%
-I'm nervous.
-Me too.

223
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.266 line:82%
Why did we have to stop on a hill?

224
00:11:09.867 --> 00:11:12.700 line:82%
-It's like a hill from a driving test.
-Yes.

225
00:11:12.767 --> 00:11:15.200 line:82%
One, two, three.

226
00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:17.233 line:82%
-Come on!
-My goodness.

227
00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:20.000 line:82%
-Come on!
-My goodness.

228
00:11:21.767 --> 00:11:24.033 line:82%
My goodness.

229
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.667 line:82%
The car is practically screaming.

230
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.767 line:82%
Isn't it thrilling?

231
00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:36.266 line:82%
I'm a bit bored.
Why don't we listen to music?

232
00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:38.700 line:82%
-I'll turn on the radio.
-Please turn on the radio.

233
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.633 line:82%
That's right. My goodness.

234
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.934 line:82%
What is this song?

235
00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:50.000 line:82%
-This song--
-Doesn't it go, "I skipped school"?

236
00:11:50.066 --> 00:11:51.033 line:82%
Yes. "An Amusement Hall."

237
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.233 line:82%
-Gosh, you like this kind of music?
-You're right.

238
00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.400 line:82%
It's my go-to song.

239
00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:00.100 line:82%
-Really?
-Really? Then sing along.

240
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.734 line:82%
I don't know the lyrics very well.

241
00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:06.567 line:82%
Back in 1998…

242
00:12:08.066 --> 00:12:10.533 line:82%
-Na-ra, what did you do in 1998?
-I made money.

243
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.800 line:82%
Same here. In 1998,

244
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:14.867 line:82%
I had just started--

245
00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:19.467 line:82%
How should I put it?
I had just started getting bigger roles.

246
00:12:19.533 --> 00:12:22.900 line:82%
-That was how it was. I wasn't a kid.
-As for me,

247
00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:24.600 line:82%
I debuted in 1997.

248
00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:26.200 line:82%
I debuted in 1995.

249
00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:27.900 line:82%
-You debuted early.
-Yes.

250
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.967 line:82%
That's right. Han's Band.

251
00:12:34.667 --> 00:12:36.633 line:82%
I was a newborn.

252
00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:42.967 line:82%
I remember everything clearly.
I bet you don't remember anything.

The construction workers were shaken up

259
00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:07.033 line:82%
by the unbelievable sight.

260
00:13:08.066 --> 00:13:10.400 line:82%
It was first discovered early last month.

261
00:13:10.467 --> 00:13:12.567 line:82%
The personnel couldn't believe their eyes.

262
00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:14.800 line:82%
I was shocked. There was so much…

263
00:13:14.867 --> 00:13:17.400 line:82%
Construction might be delayed.

264
00:13:17.467 --> 00:13:20.233 line:82%
It's a residential area, after all.

265
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.800 line:82%
As the prospective residents' anxiety
is on the rise,

266
00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:25.033 line:82%
what was found at the construction site…

267
00:13:26.266 --> 00:13:27.867 line:82%

It isn't a murder case, is it?

285
00:14:09.533 --> 00:14:12.200 line:82%
Seriously. It's too early for that.

286
00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:14.734 line:82%
-It's too early to talk about a murder.
-Right.

-JENNIE, that doesn't matter.
-Really?

It's morning.

290
00:14:22.066 --> 00:14:23.233 line:82%
The subject is too heavy.

291

Is the subject too heavy?

292
00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:27.533 line:82%
It's too heavy. I was quite surprised.

293
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.667 line:82%
I don't think it's something that serious.

They didn't go, "I was so scared."

299
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.633 line:82%
That wasn't the vibe.

300
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.467 line:82%
What can be found in the ground?

301
00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:46.633 line:82%
Are we supposed to find it?

302
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.533 line:82%
-It can't be oil, right?
-Oil.

303
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.066 line:82%

-What?

304

-I see.

305

Relics from the Joseon Dynasty

-That's Gyeongju.

313
00:15:12.734 --> 00:15:15.300 line:82%
-JENNIE, are you jetlagged?
-And she's from New Zealand.

314
00:15:15.367 --> 00:15:18.300 line:82%
-Okay.
-I don't know about these things.

315
00:15:18.367 --> 00:15:20.333 line:82%
-I haven't been on a school trip here.
-It's--

316
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.133 line:82%
-Gyeongju. Seriously.
-You've become quick-witted.

317
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.500 line:82%
Back in the day,
you would've gotten flustered.

318
00:15:27.967 --> 00:15:29.200 line:82%
How about a hot spring?

319
00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:32.567 line:82%
Do such things happen in Korea?

320
00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:34.700 line:82%
-There are hot springs in Korea.
-Really?

321
00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:37.166 line:82%
There are hot springs, JENNIE.

322
00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:38.667 line:82%
-What am I going to do?
-JENNIE.

323
00:15:38.734 --> 00:15:40.834 line:82%
-I think you're jetlagged.
-What are you doing?

324
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.033 line:82%
-Snap out of it.
-Being global is nice, but stop.

325
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.800 line:82%
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm going to get out of the car.

326
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.633 line:82%
So people were shocked.

327
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.800 line:82%
I think something big happened.

328
00:15:54.567 --> 00:15:57.000 line:82%
Didn't they say that they were scared?

329
00:15:57.066 --> 00:15:58.567 line:82%
That means it's something bad.

330
00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:29.200 line:82%
What?

331
00:16:37.367 --> 00:16:39.900 line:82%
Who's there? Who are you?

332
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.266 line:82%
This is an apartment complex.

333
00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:52.166 line:82%
People actually live here.

334
00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.300 line:82%
Let's get out.

335
00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:07.300 line:82%
-
Thank you for driving.
-
Thank you.

336
00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:11.233 line:82%
-
Thank you.
-
Thank you.

337
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.166 line:82%
We got here safely.

338
00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:17.767 line:82%
-I have a cramp in my left leg.
-Why?

339
00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:19.433 line:82%
Because of the gear stick?

340
00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:21.266 line:82%
Are you exhausted?

341
00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:23.400 line:82%
I was scared. He drove dangerously.

342
00:17:23.467 --> 00:17:26.000 line:82%
-Did you hear the news?
-What news?

343
00:17:26.734 --> 00:17:28.000 line:82%
-About a case.
-That's right.

344
00:17:28.066 --> 00:17:29.166 line:82%
-We did.
-We heard it.

345
00:17:29.233 --> 00:17:30.500 line:82%
We made deductions.

346
00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:31.734 line:82%
-What deductions?
-Yes.

347
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.166 line:82%
-We can't tell you.
-It's a team competition.

348
00:17:34.233 --> 00:17:36.767 line:82%
-Is it a team competition?
-Of course.

349
00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:39.500 line:82%
-Of course, it is.
-Is it a team competition?

350
00:17:41.633 --> 00:17:44.100 line:82%
You seem to be unaware,
but we're Team Superpowers.

351
00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:45.500 line:82%
-What?
-Team Superpowers.

352
00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:47.600 line:82%
-What's your superpower?
-Looking young for my age.

353
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.000 line:82%
That isn't a superpower.
You just get treatments.

354
00:17:51.066 --> 00:17:52.300 line:82%
You saw a dermatologist.

355
00:17:52.367 --> 00:17:53.734 line:82%
-Seriously.
-It's a talent.

356
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.633 line:82%
-You saw a dermatologist.
-While it is a talent…

357
00:17:57.767 --> 00:17:59.133 line:82%
Is there security?

358
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.800 line:82%
-An actual security guard?
-Is he an actor?

359
00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:03.200 line:82%
There's no way of knowing.

360
00:18:15.266 --> 00:18:17.433 line:82%
-An actual security guard?
-Is he an actor?

361
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.967 line:82%
There's no way of knowing.

362
00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:21.133 line:82%
-We…
-My goodness.

363
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.200 line:82%
-Woo-il, it's you.
-Woo-il.

364
00:18:23.266 --> 00:18:24.734 line:82%
-No way.
-What brings you here?

365
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.467 line:82%
-Woo-il, it's you.
-Woo-il.

366
00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:30.633 line:82%
-No way.
-What brings you here?

367
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.000 line:82%
Woo-il.

368
00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:33.567 line:82%
Guess what happens at universities.

369
00:18:33.633 --> 00:18:35.533 line:82%
Students get drunk at retreats.

370
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.133 line:82%
Why are you so ugly?

371
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.333 line:82%
Ask my mom.

372
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.500 line:82%
Who are you, you punk?

373
00:18:39.567 --> 00:18:41.700 line:82%
-I'm just Woo-il, born in 1981.
-Born in 1981.

374
00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:44.066 line:82%
-What brings you here?
-My goodness.

375
00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:47.667 line:82%
-Woo-il.
-Gosh.

376
00:18:47.734 --> 00:18:52.200 line:82%
I'm not Woo-il. You must be the ones
who moved into apartment 104.

377
00:18:52.266 --> 00:18:54.033 line:82%
Then you should take the keys.

378
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.100 line:82%
Unbelievable.

379
00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:57.133 line:82%
How is a security guard's hair so long?

380
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.633 line:82%
-By the way, sir…
-Yes?

381
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.333 line:82%
…JENNIE likes you so much.

382
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.367 line:82%
-I'm a big fan.
-Really?

383
00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:06.967 line:82%
-She's a big fan.
-Have we met before?

384
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.433 line:82%
-Don't you know JENNIE?
-Don't you?

385
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.934 line:82%
-Sir.
-Woo-il, you seem to be shaken up.

386
00:19:12.767 --> 00:19:15.467 line:82%
-Seriously.
-I've seen you often on TV.

387
00:19:15.533 --> 00:19:18.734 line:82%
-Thank you.
-This is yours, Cha Tae-hyun. Unit 406.

388
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.934 line:82%
The key for unit 407
is for you, Yu Jae-seok.

389
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.800 line:82%
-Okay.
-Take the key and go upstairs.

390
00:19:23.867 --> 00:19:27.200 line:82%
There are residency guidelines
for the new residents.

391
00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.200 line:82%
Read the guidelines,

392
00:19:29.266 --> 00:19:31.066 line:82%
but do it separately.

393
00:19:31.133 --> 00:19:33.700 line:82%
-You must not share the information.
-We can't share it?

394
00:19:33.767 --> 00:19:35.300 line:82%
-Keep it to yourself.
-Why?

395
00:19:35.367 --> 00:19:38.233 line:82%
-Why are there two? Hey, come on.
-Don't do that.

396
00:19:39.066 --> 00:19:42.500 line:82%
-Why are there two? Hey, come on.
-Don't do that.

397
00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:45.333 line:82%
-That's-- For goodness' sake.
-Hey.

398
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.467 line:82%
-As for him…
-He plays dirty.

399
00:19:47.533 --> 00:19:49.900 line:82%
…he should be watched separately.

400
00:19:49.967 --> 00:19:52.500 line:82%
-This is his style.
-He wreaks havoc.

401
00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:54.300 line:82%
-He startled me.
-He wreaks havoc.

402
00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:56.200 line:82%
Be careful.

403
00:19:56.834 --> 00:19:58.900 line:82%
-In any case, be careful.
-Why is he Apple?

404
00:19:58.967 --> 00:20:00.867 line:82%
-Is that what it says?
-Apple? I'm Apple.

405
00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:02.300 line:82%
JENNIE is Goose.

406
00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.700 line:82%
Se-chan is Bat.

407
00:20:09.734 --> 00:20:11.400 line:82%
She wants to know why she's Pig.

408
00:20:11.467 --> 00:20:12.500 line:82%
Why am I Pig?

409
00:20:12.567 --> 00:20:14.600 line:82%
-Ms. Baby Face wants to know.
-Baby face.

410
00:20:22.367 --> 00:20:25.333 line:82%
Why do I need to read this alone?

411
00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:28.233 line:82%
WE WELCOME YOU
TO WOOSANG APARTMENT

412
00:20:30.033 --> 00:20:32.400 line:82%
"Woosang Apartment holds a secret.

413
00:20:32.467 --> 00:20:35.767 line:82%
The resident who unravels the mystery
by 5 p.m.

414
00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:37.667 line:82%
will receive an amazing benefit."

415
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.233 line:82%
"The apartment's secret

416
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.066 line:82%
is based on a true event from 1998."

417
00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:54.133 line:82%
I guess that was the actual news.

418
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.166 line:82%
It was news about this apartment.

419
00:20:56.233 --> 00:20:58.300 line:82%
At an apartment construction site…

420
00:20:58.367 --> 00:21:00.266 line:82%
…was found.

421
00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:04.400 line:82%
Will I be able to do it?
Will I be able to do well?

422
00:21:18.066 --> 00:21:21.033 line:82%
If you're done reading it,
return it to me.

423
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.400 line:82%
-Okay.
-Thank you.

424
00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:24.633 line:82%
-Na-ra, what are you? Pig?
-Pig.

425
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.700 line:82%
You're Pig. JENNIE is…

426
00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:28.734 line:82%
-Goose.
-I'm Apple.

427
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.200 line:82%
-I'm Bat.
-Bat.

428
00:21:30.266 --> 00:21:31.867 line:82%
-It suits you.
-You are a bat.

429
00:21:31.934 --> 00:21:33.667 line:82%
-It suits you.
-Only mine suits me.

430
00:21:33.734 --> 00:21:34.867 line:82%
He's a bat.

431
00:21:35.533 --> 00:21:37.233 line:82%
-What are you?
-Well…

432
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.700 line:82%
-It's Nutria, right?
-No.

433
00:21:38.767 --> 00:21:40.734 line:82%
-It's Nutria, right?
-Isn't it Octopus?

434
00:21:41.834 --> 00:21:43.266 line:82%
-Toad.
-I think it said Nutria.

435
00:21:43.333 --> 00:21:44.734 line:82%
The nicknames make sense.

436
00:21:46.066 --> 00:21:48.033 line:82%
-JENNIE is Goose.
-Shall we go up?

437
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.567 line:82%
-You can go up and rest.
-Okay.

438
00:21:50.633 --> 00:21:51.600 line:82%
-Can we rest?
-Yes.

439
00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:55.100 line:82%
JENNIE, let's go. Let's go.

440
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:56.900 line:82%
-See you later.
-Okay.

441
00:21:56.967 --> 00:21:58.233 line:82%
See you later.

442
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.767 line:82%
I'll patrol the area, so go up and rest.

443
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.500 line:82%
Hold on. Gosh, it's so…

444
00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:31.767 line:82%
-Hold on.
-Hold on.

445
00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:33.467 line:82%
Gosh, it's so…

446
00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:36.467 line:82%
-Hold on.
-Hold on.

447
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.967 line:82%
What's that?

448
00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:44.533 line:82%
-What?
-What's that?

449
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.400 line:82%
-Don't do that. I'm serious.
-What's going on?

450
00:22:47.467 --> 00:22:49.433 line:82%
-Is this a murder case?
-Hold on a second.

451
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.934 line:82%
It's a murder case.

452
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.867 line:82%
You said it wouldn't be serious.
You said it wouldn't be heavy.

453
00:22:53.934 --> 00:22:55.533 line:82%
It's a murder case.

454
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.967 line:82%
-You said it'd be too heavy.
-Wait.

455
00:22:57.033 --> 00:22:59.333 line:82%
Wait. A murder case in broad daylight?

456
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.033 line:82%
-Hey, get the car.
-Hey.

457
00:23:02.734 --> 00:23:04.533 line:82%
-Hey.
-Hey, get the car.

458
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.300 line:82%
He'll leave for real.

459
00:23:06.367 --> 00:23:07.967 line:82%
I can't do this.

460
00:23:08.033 --> 00:23:09.800 line:82%
-Don't leave.
-It's a murder case.

461
00:23:09.867 --> 00:23:12.233 line:82%
-I got goosebumps.
-I can't do this.

462
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.800 line:82%
Tae-hyun, the vibe is spooky.
It must be a murder case.

463
00:23:15.533 --> 00:23:17.767 line:82%
-Tae-hyun tried to leave for real.
-I'm sorry, but…

464
00:23:18.867 --> 00:23:21.000 line:82%
-Are there individual quests?
-Of course not.

465
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:25.266 line:82%
Let me make myself clear.
I can't go down the basement. Okay?

466
00:23:25.333 --> 00:23:26.667 line:82%
-What a coward.
-I…

467
00:23:26.734 --> 00:23:28.433 line:82%
I might push you.

468
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.767 line:82%
-Be careful. I'll do it.
-He will…

469
00:23:30.834 --> 00:23:32.166 line:82%
-He'll do it for real.
-Seriously.

470
00:23:32.233 --> 00:23:33.266 line:82%
-Really?
-Be careful.

471
00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:34.667 line:82%
Maybe zombies will pour out.

472
00:23:34.734 --> 00:23:35.967 line:82%
Why would there be zombies in 1998?

473
00:23:36.033 --> 00:23:36.867 line:82%
REAL INCIDENT

474
00:23:36.934 --> 00:23:38.533 line:82%
-I was so startled.
-Same here.

475
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.233 line:82%
They mentioned a construction site.

476
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.700 line:82%
Construction must be taking place
in the basement.

477
00:23:42.767 --> 00:23:44.333 line:82%
I bet something happened there.

478
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.266 line:82%
We heard static, right?
We need to figure out what happened.

479
00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:49.600 line:82%
Was there a murder or a fall?

480
00:23:49.667 --> 00:23:52.433 line:82%
Did a construction worker
get crushed to death?

481
00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:54.600 line:82%
You're incredible.

482
00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:57.066 line:82%
-Why aren't you going in?
-What?

483
00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.867 line:82%
You should go in.

484
00:23:59.934 --> 00:24:02.834 line:82%
Let's go together. I'm scared.

485
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.433 line:82%
-You have me.
-Take the lead.

486
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.333 line:82%
Even ghosts get scared of me.

487
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.233 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

488
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.834 line:82%
Na-ra is going.

489
00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:18.467 line:82%
Old apartments have
a basement like this one.

490
00:24:18.533 --> 00:24:21.033 line:82%
-It isn't a set.
-It's real.

491
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.767 line:82%
-It's real.
-It's real.

492
00:24:24.834 --> 00:24:27.600 line:82%
These cobwebs aren't props.

493
00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:29.333 line:82%
They aren't props. They're real.

494
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.066 line:82%
The surroundings are a bit scary here.

495
00:24:33.867 --> 00:24:34.800 line:82%
What?

496
00:24:40.266 --> 00:24:41.367 line:82%
What?

497
00:24:42.367 --> 00:24:45.233 line:82%
"Nothing should be dug up or buried"?

498
00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:50.166 line:82%
Something got dug up.

499
00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:55.400 line:82%
"Nothing should be dug up…"

500
00:24:55.467 --> 00:24:56.500 line:82%
"Or buried."

501
00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.433 line:82%
At an apartment construction site…

502
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.533 line:82%
…was found.

503
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.333 line:82%
What kind of case is this?

504
00:25:04.166 --> 00:25:06.967 line:82%
…what was found at the construction site…

505
00:25:07.033 --> 00:25:09.066 line:82%
…is being watched with keen interest.

506
00:25:09.567 --> 00:25:11.300 line:82%
So construction is underway.

507
00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:14.834 line:82%
What is this?

508
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.233 line:82%
I can see that they shoveled here.

509
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.800 line:82%
This is the scene of an incident.

510
00:25:23.734 --> 00:25:27.467 line:82%
Jae-seok, I don't think it's a murder case
since it's too…

511
00:25:30.567 --> 00:25:32.633 line:82%
It doesn't seem like a murder case, right?

512
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.734 line:82%
I don't think they tried to bury a body.

513
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.400 line:82%
There are too many shovels
for it to be a murder case.

514
00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:46.367 line:82%
I think there are three culprits.

515
00:25:46.433 --> 00:25:47.333 line:82%
What?

516
00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:50.200 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

517
00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:52.233 line:82%
-I don't think that's it.
-No?

518
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.500 line:82%
You need to get a grip.

519
00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.333 line:82%
-Get a grip, Jung-ha.
-No?

520
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.867 line:82%
-Bong-seok, get a grip.
-Okay.

521
00:25:56.934 --> 00:25:59.800 line:82%
If it's a murder scene,
the tapes don't read, "Keep out."

522
00:25:59.867 --> 00:26:03.000 line:82%
-"Police." That's right.
-Yes, it says, "Police line."

523
00:26:03.066 --> 00:26:05.600 line:82%
-This isn't a police line.
-It's a construction site.

524
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.500 line:82%
I see. You're right.

525
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.834 line:82%
-It isn't a murder.
-Treasure?

526
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.100 line:82%
Treasure.

527
00:26:12.867 --> 00:26:15.400 line:82%
I think treasure is more plausible.

528
00:26:15.467 --> 00:26:19.266 line:82%
Jae-seok, it's based on a true event.
No treasure was found in Korea in 1998.

529
00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:20.300 line:82%
It makes no sense.

530
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.633 line:82%
I don't know.

531
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.600 line:82%
It's…

532
00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:25.467 line:82%
-Gosh, you startled me.
-Mister.

533
00:26:27.567 --> 00:26:29.233 line:82%
My gosh.

534
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.767 line:82%
-Gosh, you startled me.
-Mister.

535
00:26:32.834 --> 00:26:34.467 line:82%
-What's wrong with you?
-Gosh.

536
00:26:34.533 --> 00:26:36.166 line:82%
Why are you so into character?

537
00:26:36.233 --> 00:26:37.867 line:82%
Sir, you startled me.

538
00:26:38.967 --> 00:26:40.467 line:82%
-I was so startled.
-Seriously.

539
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.800 line:82%
You were startled, weren't you?

540
00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:44.734 line:82%
I told you to go up.
Why did you come here?

541
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.600 line:82%
-We heard a noise.
-What?

542
00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:47.700 line:82%
What did you hear?

543
00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:51.200 line:82%
You shouldn't be down here.
Go to your respective unit.

544
00:26:51.266 --> 00:26:52.233 line:82%
Go up.

545
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.867 line:82%
Go up. You shouldn't be down here.

546
00:26:54.934 --> 00:26:55.800 line:82%
It's off-limits.

547
00:26:55.867 --> 00:26:58.133 line:82%
-Go to your unit.
-Something happened.

548
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.767 line:82%
-Something happened here.
-Where?

549
00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:03.367 line:82%
-I don't know anything about that. Go up.
-A security guard would know.

550
00:27:03.433 --> 00:27:06.100 line:82%
-I don't know anything. Go up.
-Come on.

551
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:08.133 line:82%
-Na-ra, go up.
-Okay.

552
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.266 line:82%
I'm Shim Eun-ha.

553
00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:10.900 line:82%
Eun-ha, go up.

554
00:27:17.233 --> 00:27:20.433 line:82%
You look for meaning in every single hint.

555
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.333 line:82%
That's right.

556
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.600 line:82%
-
We need to figure out what happened.
-
We need to make deductions.

557
00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:26.500 line:82%
That's right.

558
00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:30.500 line:82%
It's scary.

559
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:32.433 line:82%
-It's an old elevator.
-An old elevator.

560
00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:34.200 line:82%
It's scary.

561
00:27:34.266 --> 00:27:36.166 line:82%
-It's an old elevator.
-An old elevator.

562
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.533 line:82%
It's scary.

563
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.000 line:82%
-Shall we use the stairs?
-Let's walk.

564
00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:47.934 line:82%
-Let's walk.
-It's an old apartment.

565
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.934 line:82%
Which unit is ours? Unit 407?

566
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.133 line:82%
-I think so.
-Unit 407.

567
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.567 line:82%
Your unit is here.

568
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.967 line:82%
Which unit is ours? Unit 407?

569
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.500 line:82%
-Are we neighbors?
-It seems that way.

570
00:27:58.567 --> 00:28:00.500 line:82%
Why did we get a key? The door is open.

571
00:28:00.567 --> 00:28:04.166 line:82%
Jae-seok, you should've pretended
to unlock the door.

572
00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:06.867 line:82%
Close the door. They need an insert shot.

573
00:28:07.734 --> 00:28:11.033 line:82%
Gosh, you're such an amateur.

574
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.166 line:82%
This isn't a drama. We don't need that.

575
00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:15.367 line:82%
What Tae-hyun said seems plausible.

576
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.667 line:82%
That's it. That's the shot we need.

577
00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:20.533 line:82%
Does it work?

578
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.734 line:82%
Gosh, I haven't seen this in a while.

579
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.233 line:82%
It's my first time seeing one.

580
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.600 line:82%
-A screen door.
-Right.

581
00:28:29.667 --> 00:28:30.834 line:82%
Gosh, the living room.

582
00:28:34.934 --> 00:28:36.300 line:82%
Isn't this someone's home?

583
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.367 line:82%
It looks that way.

584
00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:40.100 line:82%
-Do you know this? GoldStar?
-No.

585
00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:41.734 line:82%
Jae-seok, it's a GoldStar.

586
00:28:53.633 --> 00:28:54.734 line:82%
Gosh, the living room.

587
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.600 line:82%
"A happy family makes all go well."

588
00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:06.200 line:82%
Usually…

589
00:29:09.633 --> 00:29:11.066 line:82%
It's Seung-hun.

590
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.100 line:82%
It works.

591
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.400 line:82%
It's Seung-hun.

592
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.767 line:82%
This is cool.

593
00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.834 line:82%
-I don't know why I'm scared.
-I know.

594
00:29:32.066 --> 00:29:33.700 line:82%
JENNIE's mom would know.

595
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.066 line:82%
It's fascinating.

596
00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:43.633 line:82%
-I've only heard about this.
-What?

597
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.734 line:82%
-CaptainQ.
-Yes.

598
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.000 line:82%
CaptainQ.

599
00:29:46.066 --> 00:29:48.033 line:82%
It's fascinating.

600
00:29:48.533 --> 00:29:50.333 line:82%
-It gives you a headache.
-I heard that

601
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.700 line:82%
it won't give you a hangover.

602
00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:55.467 line:82%
-But you pass out for three days.
-So I heard.

603
00:29:55.533 --> 00:29:58.500 line:82%
And it blurs your vision.
Those were the rumors.

604
00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:02.200 line:82%
This room seems to have many things.

605
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.233 line:82%
Is this an actual residence?

606
00:30:06.133 --> 00:30:08.333 line:82%
The owner of the room is a SECHSKIES fan.

607
00:30:11.967 --> 00:30:14.900 line:82%
SECHSKIES. In 1998,
SECHSKIES and H.O.T. were everywhere.

608
00:30:15.467 --> 00:30:17.867 line:82%
It feels like a drama set.

609
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.633 line:82%
It's like
Reply 1998,
Jae-seok.

610
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.900 line:82%
This is incredible.

611
00:30:27.133 --> 00:30:30.734 line:82%
-These details can't be meaningless.
-That's right.

612
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.100 line:82%
-I agree, JENNIE.
-Aren't these props for the vibe?

613
00:30:33.867 --> 00:30:37.000 line:82%
I think they're here to create a vibe.

614
00:30:41.567 --> 00:30:44.200 line:82%
-I locked the door.
-The door was open.

615
00:30:45.867 --> 00:30:47.533 line:82%
My goodness.

616
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.000 line:82%
What's this?

617
00:30:50.433 --> 00:30:53.300 line:82%
It's an exact replica
of an old apartment. Unbelievable.

618
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.767 line:82%
It's a nice layout.

619
00:30:57.533 --> 00:30:59.467 line:82%
It has a typical old apartment layout.

620
00:30:59.533 --> 00:31:01.266 line:82%
It's nice and big.

621
00:31:02.934 --> 00:31:07.133 line:82%
This apartment is set in 1998.

622
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.867 line:82%
-Yes.
-That's the backdrop.

623
00:31:12.066 --> 00:31:14.767 line:82%
-Isn't that Joey Wong?
-Where?

624
00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:16.967 line:82%
-Isn't that Joey Wong?
-That's Joey Wong.

625
00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:18.734 line:82%
Is this your room?

626
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.200 line:82%
I don't know whose room it is.

627
00:31:20.266 --> 00:31:22.600 line:82%
Tae-hyun, did you like Joey Wong?

628
00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:32.233 line:82%
But

629
00:31:32.867 --> 00:31:36.800 line:82%
why is the jewelry out in the open?

630
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.467 line:82%
Why are expensive items out in the open?

631
00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.600 line:82%
Isn't it strange
that the jewelry is out in the open?

632
00:31:44.667 --> 00:31:46.100 line:82%
Was a thief here?

633
00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:48.600 line:82%
I don't think a thief was here.

634
00:31:48.667 --> 00:31:51.266 line:82%
But people don't leave jewelry boxes open.

635
00:31:51.333 --> 00:31:55.200 line:82%
Since we can see them,
don't you think they could be a clue?

636
00:31:55.266 --> 00:31:57.467 line:82%
So it isn't about finding something.

637
00:31:57.533 --> 00:31:59.033 line:82%
Wouldn't they be a clue?

638
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.100 line:82%
This is an announcement.

639
00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:11.533 line:82%
For a clue on the apartment's secret…

640
00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:20.667 line:82%
the resident gathering will begin.

641
00:32:20.734 --> 00:32:22.900 line:82%
-You must have many questions.
-Yes.

642
00:32:22.967 --> 00:32:28.000 line:82%
I came here to give you a clue

643
00:32:28.066 --> 00:32:29.734 line:82%
-on those matters.
-We…

644
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.633 line:82%
We don't know what we're supposed to do
in this apartment.

645
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.133 line:82%
-I'll give you a clue on those matters.
-Okay.

646
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.266 line:82%
But it wouldn't be fun
without a challenge.

647
00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:39.166 line:82%
-Okay.
-So you'll play a game…

648
00:32:39.233 --> 00:32:41.433 line:82%
-Okay.
-…and win clues.

649
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.867 line:82%
That's how clues should be provided.

650
00:32:42.934 --> 00:32:43.767 line:82%
The game is easy.

651
00:32:43.834 --> 00:32:47.433 line:82%
You'll play the apartment version
of Red Light, Green Light.

652
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.166 line:82%
-Yes.
-It's the Apartment Game.

653
00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:51.133 line:82%
-What?
-Apartment, Apartment. Which floor?

654
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.667 line:82%
-The 50th floor.
-
When you go to an apartment

655
00:32:53.734 --> 00:32:54.767 line:82%
That's a different game.

656
00:32:56.033 --> 00:32:58.567 line:82%
It's "When you go to a market."

657
00:32:58.633 --> 00:33:00.767 line:82%
-It doesn't matter where you go.
-Apartment.

658
00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:02.967 line:82%
The Apartment Game.

659
00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:06.200 line:82%
The members will be divided into
escapers and chasers.

660
00:33:06.266 --> 00:33:09.900 line:82%
When you hear "Apartment,"
you can only take one step.

661
00:33:10.567 --> 00:33:12.166 line:82%
-Let's get up.
-Touch.

662
00:33:12.767 --> 00:33:14.467 line:82%
-Is there a lot of water?
-Yes.

663
00:33:14.533 --> 00:33:16.667 line:82%
-There. Jae-seok, keep going that way.
-Okay.

664
00:33:16.734 --> 00:33:18.400 line:82%
Apartment.

665
00:33:18.467 --> 00:33:19.300 line:82%
It's cold.

666
00:33:19.367 --> 00:33:23.433 line:82%
But if the water goes below the red line,
the chasers are out.

667
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.367 line:82%
The escapers have a mission.

668
00:33:26.433 --> 00:33:27.734 line:82%
Apartment.

669
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.567 line:82%
-Be careful.
-Let me steady the water.

670
00:33:29.633 --> 00:33:31.133 line:82%
I escaped.

671
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.867 line:82%
Good. Go ahead.

672
00:33:39.433 --> 00:33:41.800 line:82%
-I don't have a blindfold.
-What? A blindfold?

673
00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.800 line:82%
-Tae-hyun, here it is.
-A blindfold?

674
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.467 line:82%
It's a sock.

675
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.200 line:82%
It's a sock.

676
00:33:54.367 --> 00:33:56.667 line:82%
It's my sock. Hey, it's my sock.

677
00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:59.133 line:82%
-I thought it was a blindfold.
-Hey.

678
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.767 line:82%
I put it over Tae-hyun's eyes.

679
00:34:00.834 --> 00:34:02.066 line:82%
It's my sock.

680
00:34:03.934 --> 00:34:05.600 line:82%
What should I do?

681
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.233 line:82%
-There is a lot of water.
-Okay.

682
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.800 line:82%
"Cha Tae-hyun" is too long.

683
00:34:23.867 --> 00:34:25.200 line:82%
I'll call you guys Cha and Lee.

684
00:34:25.266 --> 00:34:27.633 line:82%
I'll go, "Cha, two o'clock."

685
00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.934 line:82%
-"Cha, ten" is "Ten o'clock."
-Ten o'clock.

686
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.166 line:82%
-Good.
-Good.

687
00:34:31.233 --> 00:34:33.567 line:82%
Above all, playing a game with JENNIE

688
00:34:33.633 --> 00:34:36.233 line:82%
-is so fun.
-It's so exciting.

689
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.934 line:82%
It's so exciting.

690
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.200 line:82%
Playing with her is so fun.

691
00:34:39.266 --> 00:34:41.233 line:82%
It's like a long weekend.

692
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.400 line:82%
-Please come here.
-Let's check the mission.

693
00:34:45.467 --> 00:34:46.300 line:82%
Here you go.

694
00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:48.166 line:82%
-You can't read it yet.
-What?

695
00:34:48.233 --> 00:34:49.834 line:82%
-He didn't read it.
-Change it.

696
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.533 line:82%
-He didn't read it.
-No.

697
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.734 line:82%
You know, I've been in this industry
for way longer than you.

698
00:34:56.934 --> 00:34:59.033 line:82%
I've been in this industry
for way longer than you.

699
00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:02.734 line:82%
Woo-il, it's Jae-seok.

700
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.166 line:82%
I'm a seventh generation comedian.

701
00:35:04.233 --> 00:35:06.000 line:82%
But-- Is that so?

702
00:35:07.934 --> 00:35:10.400 line:82%
-Be good to your seniors.
-I'll pick a new one for you.

703
00:35:10.467 --> 00:35:12.567 line:82%
All right. Let's do this.

704
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.200 line:82%
-Check your mission now.
-Can we read it?

705
00:35:40.734 --> 00:35:42.734 line:82%
Point to eleven o'clock.

706
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.900 line:82%
Three o'clock. There you go.

707
00:35:44.967 --> 00:35:47.100 line:82%
Nine o'clock. That's the direction. Okay.

708
00:35:47.166 --> 00:35:50.133 line:82%
Is nine o'clock this way?

709
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.266 line:82%
Hold on. The direction is different
for each one.

710
00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:53.467 line:82%
I don't know what to do.

711
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.633 line:82%
I don't know what to do.

712
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.066 line:82%
-Just use left and right.
-Okay.

713
00:35:57.133 --> 00:35:59.567 line:82%
Let's begin. Apartment.

714
00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:03.734 line:82%
Apartment.

715
00:36:06.734 --> 00:36:09.266 line:82%
-Go back into the room.
-But…

716
00:36:12.867 --> 00:36:15.834 line:82%
What was that?
A grasshopper suddenly jumped out.

717
00:36:16.734 --> 00:36:19.200 line:82%
Gosh, he's playing dirty again.

718
00:36:19.266 --> 00:36:21.767 line:82%
What was that? He jumped.

719
00:36:22.533 --> 00:36:25.400 line:82%
-You jumped too high.
-It was one step.

720
00:36:25.467 --> 00:36:26.934 line:82%
-Go back inside.
-One step.

721
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.900 line:82%
Go back inside.

722
00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:29.900 line:82%
Jae-seok, why did you fly out?

723
00:36:29.967 --> 00:36:30.934 line:82%
Let's continue.

724
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.166 line:82%
-Toad is causing trouble.
-It was one step.

725
00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:34.900 line:82%
Go back inside. Let's continue.

726
00:36:34.967 --> 00:36:36.533 line:82%
Apartment.

727
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.633 line:82%
Look at that.

728
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.667 line:82%
Look at that.

729
00:36:39.734 --> 00:36:42.900 line:82%
Tae-hyun, Jae-seok is
right in front of you.

730
00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.066 line:82%
-Apartment.
-Take a big step.

731
00:36:45.133 --> 00:36:46.333 line:82%
Go to the right. That's it.

732
00:36:52.667 --> 00:36:54.934 line:82%
That's it. No.

733
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.600 line:82%
-No. Over there.
-Apartment.

734
00:36:56.667 --> 00:36:59.367 line:82%
What was it called?
He's going toward the door.

735
00:36:59.433 --> 00:37:02.667 line:82%
What was it called?
He's going toward the door.

736
00:37:02.734 --> 00:37:04.333 line:82%
Go toward the door. Yes.

737
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.533 line:82%
What was it called?
He's going toward the door.

738
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.033 line:82%
Go toward the door.

739
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.567 line:82%
-Yes.
-Apartment.

740
00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:13.166 line:82%
The door.
Be careful not to spill the water.

741
00:37:13.233 --> 00:37:15.700 line:82%
The door.
Be careful not to spill the water.

742
00:37:17.066 --> 00:37:18.667 line:82%
Be careful not to spill the water.

743
00:37:19.233 --> 00:37:20.800 line:82%
I got it. I got the hang of it.

744
00:37:31.467 --> 00:37:32.834 line:82%
Apartment.

745
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.600 line:82%
Hold on. They're at the door already.
We're in trouble.

746
00:37:35.667 --> 00:37:38.667 line:82%
Hold on. They're at the door already.
We're in trouble.

747
00:37:40.033 --> 00:37:42.667 line:82%
One escaper remains. Let's get him.

748
00:37:42.734 --> 00:37:44.734 line:82%
-Apartment.
-Give up on the other two.

749
00:37:45.433 --> 00:37:47.100 line:82%
Apartment.

750
00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:49.934 line:82%
How did we escape so easily?

751
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.266 line:82%
Success.

752
00:37:53.266 --> 00:37:56.600 line:82%
-Gosh, Na-ra is so funny.
-We have a talent for this.

753
00:37:56.667 --> 00:37:58.233 line:82%
Na-ra is so funny.

754
00:37:59.266 --> 00:38:00.233 line:82%
Lee, go to the left.

755
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.233 line:82%
-Apartment.
-Nine o'clock.

756
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.133 line:82%
Cha, give up.

757
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.367 line:82%
Go to the left. One escaper remains.

758
00:38:07.433 --> 00:38:09.533 line:82%
Nine o'clock.

759
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.967 line:82%
-The small room.
-The small room.

760
00:38:11.033 --> 00:38:12.800 line:82%
-Okay.
-We'll turn to the small room.

761
00:38:12.867 --> 00:38:14.433 line:82%
-Where is the small room?
-Okay.

762
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.166 line:82%
-It's to the left.
-Okay.

763
00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:18.633 line:82%
-It's to the left.
-Okay.

764
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.533 line:82%
Make a big turn.

765
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.900 line:82%
Apartment.

766
00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:24.967 line:82%
No. Water spilled on me just now.

767
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.333 line:82%
No. Water spilled on me just now.

768
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.633 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-Hold on a second.

769
00:38:33.233 --> 00:38:34.166 line:82%
Hold on a second.

770
00:38:34.233 --> 00:38:35.967 line:82%
-Apartment.
-Heave-ho.

771
00:38:36.033 --> 00:38:38.133 line:82%
-Be careful with the water.
-Water.

772
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.533 line:82%
-Stop for a second.
-Hey.

773
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.300 line:82%
-Stop for a second. Good.
-Water.

774
00:38:42.367 --> 00:38:43.900 line:82%
-Watch the water.
-Wait.

775
00:38:43.967 --> 00:38:45.934 line:82%
-All right.
-Apartment.

776
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.200 line:82%
-You need to take a step forward.

777
00:38:51.266 --> 00:38:53.400 line:82%
He went out.

778
00:38:53.467 --> 00:38:55.066 line:82%
He'll come around.

779
00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.934 line:82%
Take a big step. Go to the door.

780
00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:08.533 line:82%
Apartment.

781
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.066 line:82%
Take a big step. There you go.

782
00:39:10.133 --> 00:39:12.700 line:82%
I think he's over here.

783
00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:15.400 line:82%
-Yes, he's over there.
-Apartment.

784
00:39:15.467 --> 00:39:16.533 line:82%
Gosh, it's hot.

785

-Yes, he's over there.
-Apartment.

786

Gosh, it's hot.

787
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.800 line:82%

Apartment.

789
00:39:25.066 --> 00:39:26.233 line:82%
Cha, take a step back.

790
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.834 line:82%
Tae-hyun spilled most of his water.
If he spills more, he'll be out.

791
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.000 line:82%
All right.

792
00:39:31.066 --> 00:39:32.033 line:82%
Apartment.

793
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.367 line:82%
A small step. There you go.

794

-He's in the middle right now.
-Apartment.

795
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.834 line:82%

That little punk. Hold on.

00:39:49.066 --> 00:39:51.533 line:82%
That little punk. Hold on.

802
00:39:53.767 --> 00:39:54.867 line:82%
Apartment.

803
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.166 line:82%
-"That little punk."
-You're spilling water.

804
00:39:58.233 --> 00:39:59.700 line:82%
That sneaky punk.

805
00:39:59.767 --> 00:40:01.734 line:82%
You're spilling water. Apartment.

806
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.700 line:82%
-Not yet. Hey.
-I got him.

807
00:40:04.767 --> 00:40:06.100 line:82%
Who's this?

808
00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:07.934 line:82%
-Apartment.
-Not yet. Hey.

809

Okay.

813

I got him. Who's this?

814
00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:18.066 line:82%
Okay.

815
00:40:18.133 --> 00:40:19.133 line:82%
Who's this?

816
00:40:19.734 --> 00:40:21.200 line:82%
What? Jung-ha.

817
00:40:21.266 --> 00:40:23.433 line:82%
Tae-hyun kicked him in the groin.

818
00:40:23.934 --> 00:40:26.066 line:82%
-Who's this?
-It's me.

819
00:40:26.133 --> 00:40:28.533 line:82%
-What? Jung-ha.
-It's Jung-ha.

820
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.100 line:82%
-It's Jung-ha.
-I'm sorry.

821
00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:31.233 line:82%
I'm sorry.

822
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.467 line:82%
-Tae-hyun's water is below the red line.
-Out due to the water.

823
00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:36.900 line:82%
Okay.

824
00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.066 line:82%
It was so hard.

825
00:40:38.133 --> 00:40:40.000 line:82%
Tae-hyun, you kicked him in the groin.

826
00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:42.967 line:82%
You kicked Jung-ha in the groin.

827
00:40:43.033 --> 00:40:46.400 line:82%
Tae-hyun, why did you grab
the back of Jung-ha's neck?

828
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.834 line:82%
The Yus won this round
of the Apartment Game.

829
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.266 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

830
00:40:53.867 --> 00:40:55.166 line:82%
Yes.

831
00:40:55.233 --> 00:40:56.567 line:82%
Did two members escape?

832
00:40:56.633 --> 00:40:58.367 line:82%
-Two members escaped.
-Gosh.

833
00:40:58.433 --> 00:40:59.533 line:82%
We did well.

834
00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:04.166 line:82%
-You should dance properly.
-We did well.

835
00:41:04.734 --> 00:41:06.667 line:82%
-You should dance properly.
-Go ahead.

836
00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:10.700 line:82%
-
Na-ra is good at variety shows.
-
She's good.

837
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.400 line:82%
-
Come on.
-
What?

838
00:41:34.433 --> 00:41:36.066 line:82%
Still, we're quick.

839
00:41:36.133 --> 00:41:37.033 line:82%
It was fun.

840
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.200 line:82%
-They spilled water everywhere and left.
-Seriously.

841
00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:43.066 line:82%
They really did that.

842
00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:45.200 line:82%
I know. There is water everywhere.

843
00:41:45.266 --> 00:41:47.367 line:82%
Without a hint,
I don't know what's going on.

844
00:41:47.433 --> 00:41:48.834 line:82%
I know. I'm still lost.

845
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.266 line:82%
-Right?
-Yes.

846
00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:51.433 line:82%
Your food is here.

847
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.900 line:82%
The security guard is here.

848
00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:57.000 line:82%
-The winning team gets meat.
-It's pork belly.

849
00:41:58.433 --> 00:41:59.834 line:82%
Pork belly?

850
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.367 line:82%
It looks delicious.

851
00:42:01.433 --> 00:42:03.800 line:82%
You can cook your own meal.

852
00:42:03.867 --> 00:42:05.500 line:82%
What is this tofu for?

853
00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:07.800 line:82%
Is it for stew? Is it raw tofu?

854
00:42:07.867 --> 00:42:10.166 line:82%
I'm sorry, but is there ramyeon?

855
00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:11.633 line:82%
Ramyeon is for the losing team.

856
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.734 line:82%
-What? We prefer ramyeon.
-Then…

857
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.000 line:82%
You prefer ramyeon?

858
00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:16.333 line:82%
We won, so give us one packet.

859
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.133 line:82%
Give us two packets.

860
00:42:18.734 --> 00:42:19.567 line:82%
-Really?
-You can do it.

861
00:42:19.633 --> 00:42:23.100 line:82%
Mister, whose permission do you need?
You're the boss here.

862
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.433 line:82%
The losing team's food is here.

863
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.600 line:82%
-Nice.
-Your food is here.

864
00:42:28.667 --> 00:42:30.367 line:82%
-You can cook it and eat it.
-Okay.

865
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.100 line:82%
-Jung-ha, will you cook it?
-Of course, Na-ra.

866
00:42:37.834 --> 00:42:40.433 line:82%
You're good at measuring
the right amount of water.

867
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.266 line:82%
-I eyeball it, Na-ra.
-Really?

868
00:42:42.333 --> 00:42:45.100 line:82%
-Then I'll take out some kimchi.
-That sounds great.

869
00:42:55.066 --> 00:42:56.500 line:82%
What is it?

870
00:42:57.533 --> 00:42:58.533 line:82%
What is it?

871
00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.867 line:82%
Jung-ha.

872
00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:04.767 line:82%
No way.

873
00:43:09.533 --> 00:43:10.533 line:82%
"Look at unit 406."

874
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.066 line:82%
What are we supposed to look at?

875
00:43:25.133 --> 00:43:26.367 line:82%
This is our apartment.

876
00:43:26.433 --> 00:43:27.667 line:82%
"Look at unit 406."

877
00:43:28.233 --> 00:43:29.166 line:82%
Isn't this it?

878
00:43:29.233 --> 00:43:30.233 line:82%
"Look at unit 406."

879
00:43:30.834 --> 00:43:33.033 line:82%
Maybe we're supposed to look inside.

880
00:43:34.233 --> 00:43:37.367 line:82%
I see. We're supposed to look inside.

881
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.266 line:82%
I'm sorry.

882
00:43:40.333 --> 00:43:42.834 line:82%
We're novices, so…

883
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.433 line:82%
This is unit 406.

884
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.033 line:82%
I'm sorry.

885
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.633 line:82%
I've been on variety shows
for over ten years.

886
00:43:51.033 --> 00:43:55.166 line:82%
Everyone, I made a big mistake.
I'm sorry to disappoint.

887
00:43:55.233 --> 00:43:56.467 line:82%
-He looked at the door.
-I thought

888
00:43:56.533 --> 00:43:58.600 line:82%
something was written on the door.

889
00:43:59.667 --> 00:44:01.533 line:82%
"Look at unit 406" is confusing.

890
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.734 line:82%
Looking inside is the answer.

891
00:44:09.266 --> 00:44:12.867 line:82%
Maybe there is a hint somewhere.

892
00:44:12.934 --> 00:44:14.533 line:82%
Look around carefully.

893
00:44:17.567 --> 00:44:20.500 line:82%
Apple.

894
00:44:20.567 --> 00:44:21.967 line:82%
Apple?

895
00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:24.767 line:82%
-Apple.
-I'm Apple.

896
00:44:28.967 --> 00:44:30.967 line:82%
-Pig.
-Maybe not.

897
00:44:31.033 --> 00:44:31.867 line:82%
Pig.

898
00:44:33.066 --> 00:44:34.066 line:82%
Pig. What are you?

899
00:44:34.133 --> 00:44:36.133 line:82%
-I'm Kiwi.
-Where is kiwi?

900
00:44:36.867 --> 00:44:38.467 line:82%
There is no kiwi. Why is there no kiwi?

901
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.133 line:82%
Look for anything
that's similar to a kiwi.

902
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.200 line:82%
Kiwi. I can't find a kiwi-related item.

903
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.867 line:82%
Let's rinse the rice.

904
00:44:54.433 --> 00:44:55.667 line:82%
We need to make the rice.

905
00:44:58.467 --> 00:44:59.367 line:82%
What?

906
00:45:01.233 --> 00:45:02.867 line:82%
What is it?

907
00:45:02.934 --> 00:45:04.000 line:82%
Is there something there?

908
00:45:06.233 --> 00:45:07.266 line:82%
What is it?

909
00:45:07.967 --> 00:45:09.667 line:82%
-What's that?
-We don't need that.

910
00:45:09.734 --> 00:45:11.033 line:82%
Hold on.

911
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.166 line:82%
-What's that?
-We don't need that.

912
00:45:13.233 --> 00:45:14.100 line:82%
Hold on.

913
00:45:14.166 --> 00:45:15.633 line:82%
I was startled.

914
00:45:16.934 --> 00:45:20.100 line:82%
-There must be a hint inside.
-We played a game for it.

915
00:45:20.166 --> 00:45:22.834 line:82%
-We should watch the video.
-Seriously.

916
00:45:24.367 --> 00:45:25.300 line:82%
This is incredible.

917
00:45:26.633 --> 00:45:28.467 line:82%
JENNIE, isn't this fun?

918
00:45:28.533 --> 00:45:31.000 line:82%
-Yes, it's so much fun.
-JENNIE is excited.

919
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.767 line:82%
"Look at unit 406"?

920
00:45:33.834 --> 00:45:36.266 line:82%
"Look at unit 406"? It's the other unit.

921
00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:37.367 line:82%
It's the other unit.

922
00:45:37.967 --> 00:45:40.667 line:82%
-What's this?
-Thirteen at sign?

923
00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:49.266 line:82%
That unit holds a secret.

924
00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:50.400 line:82%
-Shall I play it?
-Play it.

925
00:45:56.033 --> 00:45:57.333 line:82%
-There we go.
-It's playing.

926
00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:00.300 line:82%
How on earth did we use videotapes
in the past?

927
00:46:02.867 --> 00:46:04.667 line:82%
"Copying is prohibited at all times…"

928
00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.500 line:82%
KVN News?
Is this real?

929
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.100 line:82%
At an apartment reconstruction site
in Mapo-gu, Seoul…

930
00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:18.000 line:82%
…was found.

931
00:46:18.066 --> 00:46:19.100 line:82%
-It's Su-kyung.
-Yes.

932
00:46:19.166 --> 00:46:21.433 line:82%
Reporter Lee Seok-ho covered the story.

933
00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.867 line:82%
It's an actual news story.

934
00:46:22.934 --> 00:46:25.467 line:82%
-It's an actual event from 1998.
-That's right.

935
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.467 line:82%
At a reconstruction site in Seoul,

936

of the Reconstruction Association

937
00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:33.033 line:82%
are absorbed in digging the ground.

938
00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.600 line:82%
-Do you see it?
-There it is. I see it.

939
00:46:36.834 --> 00:46:38.633 line:82%
-What is it?
-What is it?

940
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.000 line:82%
What could it be?

941
00:46:40.934 --> 00:46:43.967 line:82%
The construction workers
couldn't believe their eyes at first.

942
00:46:44.967 --> 00:46:47.934 line:82%
But since the construction
is scheduled to be done by next year,

943
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.867 line:82%
it can't be delayed.

944
00:46:50.967 --> 00:46:52.600 line:82%
I was shocked. There was so much…

945
00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:55.233 line:82%
-We heard this.
-The construction might be delayed.

946
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.333 line:82%
It's a residential area, after all.

947
00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.500 line:82%
Kim, an employee
of the construction company,

948
00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:00.800 line:82%
got caught while trying to steal…

949
00:47:00.867 --> 00:47:02.567 line:82%
…in the middle of the night.

950
00:47:03.133 --> 00:47:04.367 line:82%
-He tried to steal something.
-Yes.

951
00:47:04.433 --> 00:47:06.600 line:82%
So it must be something valuable.

952
00:47:07.166 --> 00:47:10.433 line:82%
Kim was handed over to the police,
who came upon receiving a report,

953
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.367 line:82%
but the retrieved…

954
00:47:11.433 --> 00:47:14.400 line:82%
…has gone missing again.

955
00:47:14.467 --> 00:47:18.433 line:82%
The police are trying to get
the full story through witness accounts

956
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.934 line:82%
and are looking for the whereabouts
of the missing…

957
00:47:22.133 --> 00:47:23.400 line:82%
Whose whereabouts?

958
00:47:26.834 --> 00:47:29.734 line:82%
What went missing, a person or an object?

959
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.700 line:82%
Both went missing.

960
00:47:31.767 --> 00:47:33.066 line:82%
-Listen.
-A person took the object.

961
00:47:33.133 --> 00:47:35.934 line:82%
-It's the missing "Blank."
-Yes.

962
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.100 line:82%
It's a two-syllable word.

963
00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:39.333 line:82%
JENNIE?

964
00:47:40.633 --> 00:47:43.166 line:82%
-JENNIE. It's a two-syllable word.
-Don't be absurd.

965
00:47:43.233 --> 00:47:47.834 line:82%
-Wouldn't that be the actual silhouette?
-A man?

966
00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:49.533 line:82%
A man?

967
00:47:53.433 --> 00:47:55.400 line:82%
Unit 406 holds the clue to what it is.

968
00:47:55.467 --> 00:47:57.667 line:82%
-The secret is in unit 406.
-That's right.

969
00:47:58.266 --> 00:48:00.900 line:82%
-If we go now, it'll look suspicious.
-Of course.

970
00:48:00.967 --> 00:48:04.600 line:82%
We can go with some pork belly.

971
00:48:04.667 --> 00:48:06.367 line:82%
-That's a good idea.
-Yes.

972
00:48:06.433 --> 00:48:07.767 line:82%
I think they'll like it.

973
00:48:07.834 --> 00:48:09.400 line:82%
JENNIE is so meticulous.

974
00:48:09.467 --> 00:48:11.200 line:82%
-Was that good?
-So meticulous.

975
00:48:11.834 --> 00:48:13.500 line:82%
I see that you've changed a lot.

976
00:48:13.567 --> 00:48:14.600 line:82%
"Was that good?"

977
00:48:15.266 --> 00:48:16.500 line:82%
That was good.

978
00:48:25.967 --> 00:48:27.400 line:82%
-I'll try it.
-Okay.

979
00:48:27.467 --> 00:48:29.467 line:82%
-JENNIE, prepare the rice.
-I'll try it.

980
00:48:29.533 --> 00:48:31.967 line:82%
-I'll grill the meat.
-Grill the meat.

981
00:48:32.033 --> 00:48:34.033 line:82%
When else would I get to eat rice
made by JENNIE?

982
00:48:45.867 --> 00:48:47.700 line:82%
It's just rice.

983
00:48:47.767 --> 00:48:50.233 line:82%
-Do you know how to cook rice?
-Yes. I'm rinsing it.

984
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.800 line:82%
-Why are you rinsing it like this?
-I…

985
00:48:52.867 --> 00:48:54.166 line:82%
-Why squeeze it?
-For rice balls?

986
00:48:54.233 --> 00:48:55.300 line:82%
You're squeezing it?

987
00:48:55.367 --> 00:48:57.533 line:82%
-I think she's making rice balls.
-Is that so?

988
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.066 line:82%
Girl, can't you do it right?

989
00:48:59.133 --> 00:49:01.834 line:82%
Mother, please wait.

990
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.333 line:82%
-Rinse the rice properly. Gosh.
-I'm doing it.

991
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.567 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-I'm in trouble.

992
00:49:08.633 --> 00:49:10.934 line:82%
This won't do.
I'm going into serious mode.

993
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.467 line:82%
What's going on? There's no cook button.

994
00:49:13.533 --> 00:49:15.000 line:82%
-It's this one.
-This one.

995
00:49:15.066 --> 00:49:17.300 line:82%
-Pull it down.
-Pull it down. Yes.

996
00:49:17.867 --> 00:49:21.000 line:82%
You have to keep your hand on the cooker
for the rice to cook.

997
00:49:21.066 --> 00:49:23.333 line:82%
Don't lie, Se-chan.

998
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.900 line:82%
-JENNIE was cute just now.
-She was cute.

999
00:49:26.967 --> 00:49:28.734 line:82%
"Don't lie."

1000
00:49:29.233 --> 00:49:31.200 line:82%
"Don't lie."

1001
00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.033 line:82%
"Don't lie."

1002
00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:48.000 line:82%
Now, the egg.

1003
00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:04.934 line:82%
-My goodness.
-All right.

1004
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.367 line:82%
-Enjoy the food.
-We'll eat the meal Bong-seok cooked.

1005
00:50:08.433 --> 00:50:11.867 line:82%
Bong-seok, you added
green onion and kkakdugi.

1006
00:50:11.934 --> 00:50:13.200 line:82%
I added the available ingredients.

1007
00:50:13.266 --> 00:50:14.700 line:82%
It looks delicious.

1008
00:50:14.767 --> 00:50:15.767 line:82%
Thank you for the food.

1009
00:50:17.934 --> 00:50:18.767 line:82%
Na-ra, eat this.

1010
00:50:18.834 --> 00:50:20.333 line:82%
-You can eat it. It's okay.
-It's okay.

1011
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.567 line:82%
Thank you.

1012
00:50:21.633 --> 00:50:24.200 line:82%
-Jung-ha is a talented man.
-Shall I get yours?

1013
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.233 line:82%
Shall I get yours?

1014
00:50:27.033 --> 00:50:28.633 line:82%
Shall I get yours?

1015
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.133 line:82%
What's this?
You scooped out food for each other.

1016
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.767 line:82%
Because of you,
she keeps having to wait to eat.

1017
00:50:33.834 --> 00:50:35.900 line:82%
-This is ridiculous.
-Bravo, Tae-hyun.

1018
00:50:35.967 --> 00:50:38.533 line:82%
I'm sorry. I'll be speedy next time.

1019
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.633 line:82%
-Let's scoop out our own food.
-Let's do that.

1020
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.734 line:82%
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

1021
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.133 line:82%
-Thank you for the food.
-Cheers.

1022
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.266 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1023
00:50:46.433 --> 00:50:49.133 line:82%
-You keep delaying your first bite.
-Cheers.

1024
00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.934 line:82%
-Is it good?
-Yes.

1025
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.000 line:82%
Do you know what kind of ramyeon is
the most delicious?

1026
00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:06.800 line:82%
-The one someone else cooked.
-Yes.

1027
00:51:07.867 --> 00:51:09.834 line:82%
Even married couples
should cook ramyeon for each other.

1028
00:51:11.367 --> 00:51:12.700 line:82%
JENNIE, is the rice done?

1029
00:51:12.767 --> 00:51:14.567 line:82%
-
I'll open it. I think it's done.
-
Let's see.

1030
00:51:21.233 --> 00:51:22.934 line:82%
-Let's close it.
-Why?

1031
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000 line:82%
-Let's close it.
-What's wrong?

1032
00:51:25.066 --> 00:51:28.800 line:82%
-Let's see it.
-It's no good.

1033
00:51:28.867 --> 00:51:30.100 line:82%
It turned into porridge.

1034
00:51:30.633 --> 00:51:33.567 line:82%
You can eat this rice after a colonoscopy.

1035
00:51:37.333 --> 00:51:39.100 line:82%
You can eat it after a colonoscopy.

1036
00:51:39.166 --> 00:51:41.767 line:82%
A colonoscopy or other procedures.

1037
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.734 line:82%
It smells delicious.

1038
00:51:47.033 --> 00:51:48.433 line:82%
It looks tasty.

1039
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.867 line:82%
-It's so tasty.
-It's tasty.

1040
00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.967 line:82%
It's tasty.

1041
00:52:02.567 --> 00:52:05.934 line:82%
The radio news talked
about people who needed to move in.

1042
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.533 line:82%
But because something was found,

1043
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.667 line:82%
-the schedule got delayed.
-That's right.

1044
00:52:10.233 --> 00:52:11.166 line:82%
Breaking news.

1045
00:52:11.233 --> 00:52:13.300 line:82%
At an apartment construction site…

1046
00:52:13.367 --> 00:52:15.100 line:82%
…was found.

1047
00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:17.300 line:82%
Something bad or relics.

1048
00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:18.500 line:82%
That's right.

1049
00:52:19.066 --> 00:52:20.233 line:82%
Celadon.

1050
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.533 line:82%
Am I a genius?

1051
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.000 line:82%
Judging by the size of the hole,
there must've been one relic.

1052
00:52:29.934 --> 00:52:32.000 line:82%
How could there be only one relic?

1053
00:52:33.367 --> 00:52:35.166 line:82%
Don't they usually get discovered in bulk?

1054
00:52:36.467 --> 00:52:37.533 line:82%
You have a point.

1055
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.433 line:82%
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

1056
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.567 line:82%
-What's up with this show?
-Hey.

1057
00:52:41.633 --> 00:52:44.767 line:82%
-We're more ignorant than you think.
-Seriously.

1058
00:52:44.834 --> 00:52:46.800 line:82%
It's my first time
being in a show like this.

1059
00:52:46.867 --> 00:52:49.667 line:82%
The year 1998, my foot. Seriously.

1060
00:52:49.734 --> 00:52:53.300 line:82%
The year 1998, my foot. Seriously.

1061
00:52:53.367 --> 00:52:54.900 line:82%
I don't even remember it.

1062
00:52:58.233 --> 00:53:00.500 line:82%
Is there something in the house?
Maybe we should look for it.

1063
00:53:01.667 --> 00:53:03.333 line:82%
What are we supposed to look for?

1064
00:53:03.934 --> 00:53:05.033 line:82%
The year 1997.

1065
00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:07.767 line:82%
Mr. Kim Man-bok. Remember the name.

1066
00:53:07.834 --> 00:53:09.333 line:82%
Mr. Kim Man-bok.

1067
00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.600 line:82%
It's so funny.
Are they looking down on us?

1068
00:53:11.667 --> 00:53:13.033 line:82%
Why wasn't "Man-bok" written
in Chinese characters?

1069
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.133 line:82%
PLAQUE OF APPRECIATION

1070
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.934 line:82%
Na-ra, we wouldn't be able
to read it if it were in Chinese.

1071
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.233 line:82%
-They're looking down on us.
-Maybe.

1072
00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:23.233 line:82%
We should look more thoroughly.

1073
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.400 line:82%
October 2nd.

1074
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.633 line:82%
October 2nd is circled.

1075
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.467 line:82%
October 2nd is circled on the calendar.

1076
00:53:36.533 --> 00:53:37.567 line:82%
-October 2nd?
-So let's

1077
00:53:37.633 --> 00:53:39.734 line:82%
check the newspaper and see what happened.

1078
00:53:41.734 --> 00:53:42.767 line:82%
October 2nd?

1079
00:53:47.533 --> 00:53:49.100 line:82%
Was the date given at random?

1080
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.533 line:82%
The Chinese character for gold.

1081
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.600 line:82%
Gold.

1082
00:54:00.667 --> 00:54:02.133 line:82%
-Did they find gold?
-What?

1083
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.600 line:82%
Did they find gold in the basement?

1084
00:54:08.734 --> 00:54:10.800 line:82%
Maybe they found gold in the basement.

1085
00:54:10.867 --> 00:54:12.600 line:82%
-Goldfish.
-Goldfish.

1086
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:17.066 line:82%
-All the medals are gold too.
-Keep your voice down.

1087
00:54:17.133 --> 00:54:18.934 line:82%
-Kim means gold too.
-Kim Man-bok.

1088
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.166 line:82%
That's right. Gold.

1089
00:54:21.233 --> 00:54:22.467 line:82%
-Gold.
-Gold Rice.

1090
00:54:24.667 --> 00:54:26.100 line:82%
Gold.

1091
00:54:26.166 --> 00:54:28.400 line:82%
Na-ra.

1092
00:54:28.467 --> 00:54:29.700 line:82%
-What?
-Golden apples.

1093
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.433 line:82%
Golden apples.

1094
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.934 line:82%
-Kiwi.
-Gold kiwis.

1095
00:54:38.667 --> 00:54:40.166 line:82%
-Kiwi.
-Gold kiwis.

1096
00:54:46.033 --> 00:54:48.767 line:82%
-We need to keep it down.
-Okay.

1097
00:54:48.834 --> 00:54:51.333 line:82%
What was Jae-seok?

1098
00:54:52.133 --> 00:54:53.266 line:82%
Golden toad.

1099
00:54:53.333 --> 00:54:55.200 line:82%
Golden toad. Golden goose.

1100
00:54:55.266 --> 00:54:56.600 line:82%
And the bat-- Gold bat?

1101
00:54:56.667 --> 00:54:58.400 line:82%
Gold bat, silver bat.

1102
00:54:58.467 --> 00:55:00.633 line:82%
-Gold bat?
-Gold bat, silver bat.

1103
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.266 line:82%
Golden bat.

1104
00:55:03.834 --> 00:55:05.133 line:82%
Golden bat.

1105
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.300 line:82%
A VEIN OF GOLD FOUND

1106
00:55:23.367 --> 00:55:26.200 line:82%
At an apartment reconstruction site
in Mapo-gu, Seoul,

1107
00:55:26.266 --> 00:55:28.633 line:82%
a vein of gold was found.

1108
00:55:29.233 --> 00:55:30.700 line:82%
-Do you see it?
-There it is.

1109
00:55:30.767 --> 00:55:31.700 line:82%
I see it.

1110
00:55:31.767 --> 00:55:34.433 line:82%
It's a lump of gold.

1111
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.900 line:82%
It's my first time seeing gold.

1112
00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:41.834 line:82%
I'm shocked that so much is coming out.

1113
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.133 line:82%
An extensive analysis revealed
the vein of gold to be profitable.

1114
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.200 line:82%
But due to the move-in schedule,

1115
00:55:47.266 --> 00:55:48.967 line:82%
they decided to give up on development

1116
00:55:49.033 --> 00:55:51.867 line:82%
and name the apartment Gold Apartment.

1117
00:56:01.734 --> 00:56:04.033 line:82%
Isn't it strange
that the jewelry is out in the open?

1118
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.633 line:82%
NO SMOKING, GOLD SMOKING

1119
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.100 line:82%
Golden Week.

1120
00:56:08.166 --> 00:56:09.266 line:82%
GOLD

1121
00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:10.867 line:82%
This is a GoldStar microwave.

1122
00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:12.200 line:82%
-GoldStar.
-Everything is gold.

1123
00:56:12.266 --> 00:56:13.367 line:82%
It's gold.

1124
00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.367 line:82%
Go and take a peek.

1125
00:56:24.433 --> 00:56:26.100 line:82%
-
Should I go and see?
-
Yes.

1126
00:56:29.867 --> 00:56:31.000 line:82%
-Yes?
-No.

1127
00:56:31.567 --> 00:56:32.400 line:82%
Knock, knock.

1128
00:56:32.467 --> 00:56:34.100 line:82%
-JENNIE, what is it?
-JENNIE.

1129
00:56:34.166 --> 00:56:36.767 line:82%
-I brought some meat.
-Come on in.

1130
00:56:36.834 --> 00:56:38.300 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Can I come in?

1131
00:56:38.367 --> 00:56:39.333 line:82%
Come on in.

1132
00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:44.667 line:82%
JENNIE, did the older members send you?

1133
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:47.066 line:82%
-No, I wanted to share the meat.
-Thank you.

1134
00:56:47.133 --> 00:56:48.100 line:82%
We were going to visit.

1135
00:56:48.166 --> 00:56:50.300 line:82%
-Seriously.
-I wanted to share the meat.

1136
00:56:50.367 --> 00:56:51.600 line:82%
-Are you staying?
-Yes.

1137
00:56:51.667 --> 00:56:52.934 line:82%
Give me some information.

1138
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:53.834 line:82%
What is it?

1139
00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.533 line:82%
Why are you here? Tell us honestly.

1140
00:56:56.133 --> 00:56:57.266 line:82%
I guess it's human nature.

1141
00:56:58.633 --> 00:56:59.967 line:82%
Now that JENNIE is here,

1142
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.000 line:82%
I want to share what I know.

1143
00:57:04.033 --> 00:57:05.166 line:82%
Hey.

1144
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.467 line:82%
Is there something you know?

1145
00:57:08.433 --> 00:57:09.567 line:82%
Are you insane?

1146
00:57:11.033 --> 00:57:12.800 line:82%
It's the JENNIE effect.

1147
00:57:12.867 --> 00:57:15.734 line:82%
If the other two had come,
I would've slapped them.

1148
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.333 line:82%
Maybe he's a spy.

1149
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.500 line:82%
I'm not a spy.

1150
00:57:26.133 --> 00:57:27.200 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-What?

1151
00:57:27.266 --> 00:57:28.667 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-What?

1152
00:57:28.734 --> 00:57:29.734 line:82%
No. That man

1153
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.934 line:82%
-isn't allowed inside.
-You need to eat.

1154
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.300 line:82%
Thank you for the food.

1155
00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:34.967 line:82%
-Bye.
-All right.

1156
00:57:35.033 --> 00:57:38.000 line:82%
JENNIE, you looked like their daughter.

1157
00:57:39.433 --> 00:57:40.867 line:82%
Jae-seok, big news.

1158
00:57:40.934 --> 00:57:42.667 line:82%
-What?
-I have big news.

1159
00:57:42.734 --> 00:57:44.433 line:82%
-Hurry up.
-What is it?

1160
00:57:45.567 --> 00:57:47.400 line:82%
-I figured it out. I saw it.
-What is it?

1161
00:57:47.467 --> 00:57:48.300 line:82%
What did you see?

1162
00:57:48.367 --> 00:57:49.734 line:82%
-Did you find it?
-What?

1163
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.233 line:82%
On the fridge was a flyer
for the Golden Week sales.

1164
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.000 line:82%
"Golden" was in a different color.

1165
00:58:04.166 --> 00:58:05.633 line:82%
So I looked around.

1166
00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.300 line:82%
There was a goldfish.

1167
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.834 line:82%
And many videotapes
had a homophone for gold.

1168
00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:15.734 line:82%
And there were seeds
for a flower with "gold" in the name.

1169
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.266 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

1170
00:58:18.333 --> 00:58:20.333 line:82%
-Then it's gold.
-Maybe it's a gold bar.

1171
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.934 line:82%
It's the same thing.

1172
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.467 line:82%
Go ahead and eat.

1173
00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:26.000 line:82%
Then where is the gold now?

1174
00:58:42.533 --> 00:58:45.600 line:82%
This is an announcement for the residents.

1175
00:58:45.667 --> 00:58:47.867 line:82%
-Hold on.
-What is it?

1176
00:58:47.934 --> 00:58:51.367 line:82%
Every single resident

1177
00:58:51.433 --> 00:58:54.533 line:82%
must gather at the Senior Center.

1178
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:55.700 line:82%
The Senior Center?

1179
00:58:55.767 --> 00:58:57.867 line:82%
-It's the security guard.
-The Senior Center.

1180
00:58:58.367 --> 00:59:00.500 line:82%
I think I can drive.

1181
00:59:01.266 --> 00:59:03.767 line:82%
-Let me get a feel for it.
-I'll hold this.

1182
00:59:03.834 --> 00:59:04.667 line:82%
Okay.

1183
00:59:06.367 --> 00:59:08.500 line:82%
My goodness, hello.

1184
00:59:12.667 --> 00:59:16.834 line:82%
The elders are excited because of you.

1185
00:59:17.433 --> 00:59:21.033 line:82%
I was eating snacks over there,
but they showed no interest.

1186
00:59:25.333 --> 00:59:26.934 line:82%
First gear.

1187
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.533 line:82%
-What? Na-ra is leaving.
-What?

1188
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.900 line:82%
She's leaving.

1189
00:59:38.967 --> 00:59:41.400 line:82%
-Is she practicing?
-Is she practicing?

1190
00:59:41.967 --> 00:59:43.900 line:82%
Na-ra, you're so cool.

1191
00:59:46.033 --> 00:59:47.233 line:82%
My goodness.

1192
00:59:47.967 --> 00:59:50.266 line:82%
So far, it's the same as an automatic.

1193
00:59:50.333 --> 00:59:52.333 line:82%
I'll know when I get on the main road.

1194
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.734 line:82%
-She's back.
-She's back.

1195
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.066 line:82%
-I'm sorry. You're scared, right?
-No.

1196
01:00:06.633 --> 01:00:07.500 line:82%
No, I'm not.

1197
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.400 line:82%
There we go.

1198
01:00:10.467 --> 01:00:12.400 line:82%
There we go.

1199
01:00:12.967 --> 01:00:14.100 line:82%
Driving a stick shift is hard.

1200
01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.633 line:82%
Gosh, what should I do?

1201
01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.233 line:82%
What should I do? Oh, no.

1202
01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.700 line:82%
Gosh, what should I do?

1203
01:00:26.767 --> 01:00:28.800 line:82%
What should I do? Oh, no.

1204
01:00:28.867 --> 01:00:30.834 line:82%
I can't do it.

1205
01:00:33.266 --> 01:00:34.266 line:82%
I can't do it.

1206
01:00:42.834 --> 01:00:45.000 line:82%
Gosh, what should I do?

1207
01:00:45.066 --> 01:00:48.567 line:82%
What should I do? I can't do it.

1208
01:00:50.133 --> 01:00:52.133 line:82%
My goodness. No.

1209
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.300 line:82%
One, two, three.

1210
01:00:55.367 --> 01:00:57.033 line:82%
I can't do it. It has been a while.

1211
01:00:58.967 --> 01:01:01.000 line:82%
That was so close just now.

1212
01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.667 line:82%
Who's the awesome driver? Na-ra?

1213
01:01:04.233 --> 01:01:05.400 line:82%
-You should drive.
-Sorry.

1214
01:01:05.467 --> 01:01:07.900 line:82%
-I can't. I realize that now.
-It's okay.

1215
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.066 line:82%
Hey, Na-ra!

1216
01:01:11.066 --> 01:01:11.967 line:82%
Hey, Na-ra!

1217
01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:14.066 line:82%
-I thought we were going to die.
-Just now…

1218
01:01:14.133 --> 01:01:16.200 line:82%
-It was scary, right?
-Yes, it was.

1219
01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:29.100 line:82%
I'm sure the other team figured out
that they need to find gold

1220
01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:31.600 line:82%
just like we did.

1221
01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:33.600 line:82%
-It seems that way.
-Right?

1222
01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:36.900 line:82%
-On what we saw earlier…
-Yes.

1223
01:01:36.967 --> 01:01:40.133 line:82%
-…it said, "13 at sign T-H."
-T-H.

1224
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:47.734 line:82%
We found the clues for gold in unit 406.

1225
01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.233 line:82%
The clue to where that 13 thing is.

1226
01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.033 line:82%
What could it mean?

1227
01:01:53.967 --> 01:01:57.066 line:82%
-The next game will give us a clue.
-Will there be a clue?

1228
01:01:57.133 --> 01:02:00.633 line:82%
It's about time
we get closer to the answer.

1229
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:04.667 line:82%
So someone hid the gold somewhere and…

1230
01:02:05.233 --> 01:02:06.800 line:82%
I don't know what's happening.

1231
01:02:06.867 --> 01:02:08.000 line:82%
Here it is.

1232
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.734 line:82%
Hello.

1233
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.100 line:82%
-Welcome.
-Here you are.

1234
01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:17.467 line:82%
Did you eat something?

1235
01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.033 line:82%
Yes, I did.

1236
01:02:20.367 --> 01:02:22.900 line:82%
Is that so? Why are you so dazed?

1237
01:02:22.967 --> 01:02:25.734 line:82%
-Did you use up your energy?
-You seem exhausted.

1238
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.867 line:82%
-I guess you got a lot of information.
-I think

1239
01:02:27.934 --> 01:02:29.734 line:82%
you're memorizing things.

1240
01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.800 line:82%
There are so many things to do.

1241
01:02:31.867 --> 01:02:34.200 line:82%
Judging by his pallor,

1242
01:02:34.266 --> 01:02:36.567 line:82%
I can tell he received
a lot of information.

1243
01:02:36.633 --> 01:02:37.734 line:82%
-His face is pale.
-Yes.

1244
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.066 line:82%
-I've been memorizing lines.
-Is that so?

1245
01:02:40.133 --> 01:02:40.967 line:82%
Yes.

1246
01:02:41.667 --> 01:02:44.967 line:82%
Let's take a seat.
The two teams should alternate.

Na-ra is really loud.

1252
01:03:01.567 --> 01:03:03.667 line:82%
She's no joke. This ear will rot.

1253
01:03:04.667 --> 01:03:05.800 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1254

1262
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.166 line:82%
The two of us will play the game
to demonstrate. If I go…

1263

-Right.

1264

1269
01:03:38.533 --> 01:03:41.367 line:82%
-I was too focused on memorization.
-Okay.

1270
01:03:41.433 --> 01:03:42.500 line:82%

Okay.

1286
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.700 line:82%

1289
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.533 line:82%

01:05:07.633 --> 01:05:08.900 line:82%
That's stage one.

1309
01:05:08.967 --> 01:05:10.233 line:82%
I'll mess up in round one.

1310
01:05:11.734 --> 01:05:13.066 line:82%
-That's hard.
-Right.

1311
01:05:13.133 --> 01:05:14.667 line:82%
I doubt there'll be more moves.

Since you messed up twice,
you'll advance to stage two.

1338

Comedian Kim Jeong-ryeol used to do this.

1339

1357
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.433 line:82%

-You said you were good at this.
-When did I say that?

1375
01:08:14.767 --> 01:08:16.433 line:82%
Why are you so stern with me?

1376
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.900 line:82%
You should try doing this. I can't focus.

1377
01:08:19.967 --> 01:08:22.800 line:82%
My mind goes totally blank.

1378

How do you expect Na-ra to do that?

Try it.

Let me try it.

1385

We don't need to do it just yet.

01:09:12.834 --> 01:09:13.667 line:82%
What's up with you?

1400
01:09:13.734 --> 01:09:16.166 line:82%
-It's correct.
-The teams alternate.

1401
01:09:16.233 --> 01:09:17.967 line:82%
Woo-il, anyone can see
that the teams alternate.

1402
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.567 line:82%
-Let's resume the game.
-Okay.

1403
01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:24.433 line:82%
-
Say it backward, way to go
-
Say it backward, way to go

1404
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.400 line:82%
You're going to kick me.

1405
01:09:25.467 --> 01:09:26.433 line:82%
Two-syllable person name.

1406
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.400 line:82%
Chan-se.

1407
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.567 line:82%
Two-syllable color.

1408
01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:31.533 line:82%
Soncrim.

1409
01:09:32.166 --> 01:09:33.233 line:82%
Two-syllable country name.

1410
01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:35.400 line:82%
Rupe.

1411
01:09:35.467 --> 01:09:36.600 line:82%
Two-syllable country name.

1412
01:09:37.467 --> 01:09:38.567 line:82%
Panja.

1413
01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:40.200 line:82%
Two-syllable vegetable name.

1414
01:09:40.266 --> 01:09:41.100 line:82%
Rotcar.

1415
01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.533 line:82%
Two-syllable animal name.

1416
01:09:43.667 --> 01:09:44.600 line:82%
Dog poop.

1417
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:47.433 line:82%
Dog poop.

1418
01:09:49.467 --> 01:09:52.400 line:82%
-Shouldn't it count as an answer?
-No.

1419
01:09:52.467 --> 01:09:53.834 line:82%
That's utter dog poop.

1420
01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.033 line:82%
I wanted to try it.

1421
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.266 line:82%
That's utter dog poop.

1422
01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:58.333 line:82%
He's bad at this game. He's a weak link.

1423
01:09:58.834 --> 01:09:59.867 line:82%
The Yus won.

1424
01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:02.500 line:82%
-We won.
-We won?

1425
01:10:02.567 --> 01:10:04.734 line:82%
Hey, we're the gods of games.

1426
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.567 line:82%
-That's incredible.
-Jae-seok was abysmal at it.

1427
01:10:07.633 --> 01:10:10.767 line:82%
-Well done.
-Since Jae-seok's team won,

1428
01:10:10.834 --> 01:10:12.867 line:82%
-they'll receive a hint.
-That's good.

1429
01:10:12.934 --> 01:10:14.400 line:82%
It's the Yus, not Jae-seok's team.

1430
01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:16.767 line:82%
-The Yus.
-Yes.

1431
01:10:17.567 --> 01:10:19.934 line:82%
Woo-il, will we see you next week?

1432
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.667 line:82%
Let me ask you that. Will we?

1433
01:10:21.734 --> 01:10:25.800 line:82%
Woo-il might say he's busy
even if the producers ask him to come.

1434
01:10:25.867 --> 01:10:27.166 line:82%
He might decline the offer.

1435
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.133 line:82%
-Woo-il is in a daze.
-That's understandable.

1436
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.300 line:82%
This is for the Yus.

1437
01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.834 line:82%
-It's just for us three.
-Yes.

1438
01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:38.133 line:82%
Please check it
upon returning to the apartment.

1439
01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.033 line:82%
We're good at deductions.

1440
01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.200 line:82%
That's right. We can figure it out
even without a hint.

1441
01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.200 line:82%
We're home. I feel comfortable at home.

1442
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.734 line:82%
Let's watch it.

1443
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.800 line:82%
-Jae-seok, let's go.
-Hey.

1444
01:10:50.867 --> 01:10:52.667 line:82%
Let's watch it. We're nearly done.

1445
01:10:52.734 --> 01:10:53.667 line:82%
Okay.

1446
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.066 line:82%
We have nothing more to find here.

1447
01:10:56.133 --> 01:11:00.300 line:82%
Let's see how they react
and plan our next move.

1448
01:11:00.367 --> 01:11:03.000 line:82%
It's frustrating
since we don't know what's happening.

1449
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.900 line:82%
Was the title the same?

1450
01:11:04.967 --> 01:11:07.500 line:82%
-Yes, the title was the same.
-Really?

1451
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.133 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

1452
01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.166 line:82%
-Then it's gold.
-Maybe it's a gold bar.

1453
01:11:12.233 --> 01:11:13.700 line:82%
It's the same thing.

1454
01:11:13.767 --> 01:11:17.000 line:82%
Last month, a gold mine
that contains 14.5 g of gold per ton

1455
01:11:17.066 --> 01:11:19.066 line:82%
was discovered.

1456
01:11:19.133 --> 01:11:21.934 line:82%
As the residents' move-in date was near,

1457
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.166 line:82%
the vein of gold wasn't examined further.

1458
01:11:24.233 --> 01:11:27.467 line:82%
But the apartment was named
the Mapo Gold Apartment.

1459
01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.734 line:82%
Kim, an employee
of the construction company,

1460
01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.800 line:82%
got caught while trying to steal gold
in the middle of the night.

1461
01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.400 line:82%
What?

1462
01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:48.166 line:82%
It's on.
3 p.m. Paradise Bath House?

1463
01:11:53.066 --> 01:11:53.934 line:82%
What?

1464
01:12:01.967 --> 01:12:05.433 line:82%
-Is there a bathhouse nearby?
-A bathhouse?

1465
01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:18.066 line:82%
-What is it?
-Kg?

1466
01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:19.333 line:82%
-Five kilograms?
-Five kilograms.

1467
01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.533 line:82%
Is there 5 kg of gold?

1468
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.800 line:82%
-What?
-Kg?

1469
01:12:23.867 --> 01:12:25.233 line:82%
-Five kilograms?
-Five kilograms.

1470
01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.567 line:82%
Is there 5 kg of gold?

1471
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.433 line:82%
-Again.
-Let's watch it again.

1472
01:12:31.133 --> 01:12:33.533 line:82%
Jae-seok, do you have the first tape?

1473
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.600 line:82%
Of course.

1474
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.467 line:82%
Thirteen at sign?

1475
01:12:45.533 --> 01:12:46.900 line:82%
The 13th floor?

1476
01:12:47.667 --> 01:12:48.500 line:82%
The 13th floor?

1477
01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:50.800 line:82%
But there is no 13th floor.

1478
01:12:58.934 --> 01:13:02.266 line:82%
Five kilograms of gold isn't a lot, is it?

1479
01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:03.433 line:82%
Right.

1480
01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.834 line:82%
Do you think it's "Bath"?

1481
01:13:05.567 --> 01:13:06.900 line:82%
Do you think it's "Bath"?

1482
01:13:08.066 --> 01:13:10.100 line:82%
B-A-T-H. Bath.

1483
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.467 line:82%
B-A-T-H. Bath.

1484
01:13:19.266 --> 01:13:21.300 line:82%
-It's a B, not the number 13.
-Yes.

1485
01:13:21.367 --> 01:13:24.100 line:82%
-That's right.
-Bath.

1486
01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.033 line:82%
Bath. It's "Bath."

1487
01:13:27.633 --> 01:13:28.600 line:82%
It's "Bath."

1488
01:13:30.066 --> 01:13:32.333 line:82%
-It's "Bath."
-You don't disappoint.

1489
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.467 line:82%
-Nice pronunciation.
-You studied in New Zealand.

1490
01:13:34.533 --> 01:13:36.600 line:82%
-That's a bathhouse too.
-A bathhouse.

1491
01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:41.233 line:82%
The whereabouts-- You know--

1492
01:13:42.333 --> 01:13:44.867 line:82%
I think it means
the gold is in the bathtub.

1493
01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:45.834 line:82%
I think so too.

1494
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.467 line:82%
I think it means
the gold is in the bathtub.

1495
01:13:48.533 --> 01:13:49.433 line:82%
I think so too.

1496
01:13:50.934 --> 01:13:52.033 line:82%
Our bathroom?

1497
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.433 line:82%
I mean-- JENNIE. Jae-seok.

1498
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.300 line:82%
It's unit 406, not this one.
We're in unit 407.

1499
01:14:06.033 --> 01:14:08.367 line:82%
Now, we know that the item is gold.

1500
01:14:08.433 --> 01:14:10.333 line:82%
-We're looking for gold.
-Gold.

1501
01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.266 line:82%
I think the other team knows that too.

1502
01:14:12.333 --> 01:14:13.266 line:82%
Really?

1503
01:14:14.066 --> 01:14:16.033 line:82%
-Bath.
-That's right.

1504
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.533 line:82%
-We need to go.
-Let's go.

1505
01:14:19.033 --> 01:14:20.133 line:82%
It was an actual event.

1506
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.433 line:82%
-That's right.
-In that case…

1507
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.967 line:82%
If all of us barge in,

1508
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.100 line:82%
they'll become suspicious.

1509
01:14:27.166 --> 01:14:30.066 line:82%
Are you saying that you'll go alone?
Jae-seok.

1510
01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:33.033 line:82%
Are you saying that you'll go alone?
Jae-seok.

1511
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.400 line:82%
-Don't be ridiculous.
-I didn't say that.

1512
01:14:35.467 --> 01:14:38.567 line:82%
How could you go alone
when JENNIE and I made deductions?

1513
01:14:38.633 --> 01:14:39.934 line:82%
Let's go together.

1514
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.667 line:82%
-He's quicker to act now.
-I know.

1515
01:14:42.734 --> 01:14:43.734 line:82%
I'm nervous.

1516
01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.333 line:82%
-What is it?
-What are you guys doing?

1517
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.867 line:82%
-Nothing.
-What is it?

1518
01:14:52.934 --> 01:14:54.300 line:82%
Tae-hyun, your unit…

1519
01:14:54.367 --> 01:14:55.700 line:82%
Why are you entering without permission?

1520
01:14:55.767 --> 01:14:58.333 line:82%
Why can't we do that?
You entered our apartment.

1521
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.200 line:82%
Neighbors should be able
to visit each other.

1522
01:15:00.266 --> 01:15:03.834 line:82%
-That's right.
-I bet the hint led you guys to unit 406.

1523
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:04.800 line:82%
The what?

1524
01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:06.200 line:82%
-The hint.
-So everyone came.

1525
01:15:06.266 --> 01:15:07.100 line:82%
-No.
-No.

1526
01:15:07.734 --> 01:15:09.900 line:82%
Why else would you come to our apartment?

1527
01:15:09.967 --> 01:15:11.867 line:82%
To be honest, I don't know.

1528
01:15:12.934 --> 01:15:14.500 line:82%
I'm frustrated. Tell us what you know.

1529
01:15:14.567 --> 01:15:16.133 line:82%
-We have info too.
-Let's team up.

1530
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.166 line:82%
-We have information too.
-Let's team up.

1531
01:15:18.233 --> 01:15:20.133 line:82%
-Will you share information?
-Yes.

1532
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.066 line:82%
Let's share. Okay.

1533
01:15:21.133 --> 01:15:23.633 line:82%
-In that case, spend five minutes…
-Okay.

1534
01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.233 line:82%
Spend five minutes in unit 407.

1535
01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.467 line:82%
Why?

1536
01:15:27.533 --> 01:15:29.000 line:82%
That's how you share.

1537
01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:31.066 line:82%
-This unit--
-That's nonsense.

1538
01:15:31.133 --> 01:15:33.333 line:82%
-This unit--
-That's nonsense.

1539
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.266 line:82%
No, thank you.

1540
01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:36.934 line:82%
-You want to ransack this unit without us.
-No.

1541
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.800 line:82%
You've heard of office sharing, right?
It's the same thing.

1542
01:15:39.867 --> 01:15:42.100 line:82%
-Nonsense.
-Then put a spy in each group.

1543
01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:44.633 line:82%
-What's wrong?
-Yes. One member will remain.

1544
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.000 line:82%
-One member will remain?
-Just one.

1545
01:15:46.066 --> 01:15:47.133 line:82%
Just one.

1546
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.600 line:82%
-Fine.
-Fine.

1547
01:15:48.667 --> 01:15:50.033 line:82%
-Really?
-It's a good idea.

1548
01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:53.734 line:82%
One member will share the clues
in the other unit,

1549
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.600 line:82%
so let two members stay here.

1550
01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.400 line:82%
-With one of us?
-Okay.

1551
01:15:59.467 --> 01:16:02.533 line:82%
-Do you guys want to go? I'll stay.
-That sounds good.

1552
01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.400 line:82%
-Stay then. We'll go.
-I'll stay.

1553
01:16:04.467 --> 01:16:06.166 line:82%
One? Two? Okay.

1554
01:16:06.233 --> 01:16:08.000 line:82%
-Go and share the hints.
-Okay.

1555
01:16:09.867 --> 01:16:11.166 line:82%
This is good, right?

1556
01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.767 line:82%
-We're grateful.
-Seriously.

1557
01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:14.266 line:82%
Tae-hyun.

1558
01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.734 line:82%
-Can we look around the place?
-Of course.

1559
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.734 line:82%
-We did that.
-Tae-hyun, do well.

1560
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.133 line:82%
There is nothing to do well.

1561
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.500 line:82%
-We did that.
-Tae-hyun, do well.

1562
01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:30.033 line:82%
There is nothing to do well.

1563
01:16:38.633 --> 01:16:40.567 line:82%
What's this for?

1564
01:16:40.633 --> 01:16:42.800 line:82%
Tae-hyun, it's hard.

1565
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.100 line:82%
He goes up on the scale.

1566
01:17:22.066 --> 01:17:23.567 line:82%
Why are they showing a scale?

1567
01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:31.800 line:82%
Is anything there, JENNIE?

1568
01:17:39.834 --> 01:17:43.300 line:82%
There's a dumbbell. Put it on the scale.

1569
01:17:47.367 --> 01:17:50.500 line:82%
You know…

1570
01:17:50.567 --> 01:17:52.767 line:82%
What are you doing? Is something there?

1571
01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.133 line:82%
We're just looking.

1572
01:17:54.633 --> 01:17:55.467 line:82%
You know…

1573
01:18:15.266 --> 01:18:16.300 line:82%
Did you find something?

1574
01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:23.233 line:82%
-What?
-Did you find something?

1575
01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.734 line:82%
I was just looking.

1576
01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.300 line:82%
-Seriously. We checked the entire place.
-Right.

1577
01:18:27.367 --> 01:18:29.133 line:82%
I just want to check more thoroughly.

1578
01:18:29.934 --> 01:18:33.400 line:82%
-Tae-hyun, in that case-- Tae-hyun.
-What?

1579
01:18:33.467 --> 01:18:36.867 line:82%
-You guys just received the clues.
-Yes.

1580
01:18:36.934 --> 01:18:39.567 line:82%
You guys received the clues.

1581
01:18:39.633 --> 01:18:42.133 line:82%
-So--
-We don't know what to do next.

1582
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.066 line:82%
We want to know what we're supposed to do.

1583
01:19:01.033 --> 01:19:02.400 line:82%
Breaking news.

1584
01:19:02.467 --> 01:19:05.533 line:82%
At an apartment construction site,
a vein of gold was found.

1585
01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.700 line:82%
-What?
-What was found?

1586
01:19:06.767 --> 01:19:09.433 line:82%
It's a lump of gold.

1587
01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.333 line:82%
-That's a good idea.
-Yes.

1588
01:19:18.166 --> 01:19:19.934 line:82%
I can't believe it.

1589
01:19:23.667 --> 01:19:25.200 line:82%
Where's the gold?

1590
01:19:27.033 --> 01:19:28.834 line:82%
Where's the gold?

1591
01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:37.233 line:82%
What's the meaning of this?
There's no gold.

1592
01:19:43.166 --> 01:19:44.934 line:82%
Where's the gold?

1593
01:19:51.633 --> 01:19:53.834 line:82%
"If you escape the apartment
with the briefcase

1594
01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.233 line:82%
between 4:30 and 5 p.m.,

1595
01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.967 line:82%
all the gold bars will be yours."

1596
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.300 line:82%
What does that mean? The gold isn't here.

1597
01:20:11.934 --> 01:20:13.200 line:82%
Seriously.

1598
01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:16.400 line:82%
-What is she doing?
-It's a reality check.

1599
01:20:16.967 --> 01:20:18.467 line:82%
-What is she doing?
-It's a reality check.

1600
01:20:18.533 --> 01:20:20.767 line:82%
What are you doing?

1601
01:20:24.367 --> 01:20:25.367 line:82%
What are you doing?

1602
01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:31.233 line:82%
What are you doing?

1603
01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.133 line:82%
What are you doing?

1604
01:20:35.867 --> 01:20:37.533 line:82%
I was thinking.

1605
01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.900 line:82%
-Is there something inside?
-No.

1606
01:20:40.533 --> 01:20:42.633 line:82%
-Is it this room?
-I checked the bathroom.

1607
01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.367 line:82%
I mean…

1608
01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:47.600 line:82%
I checked all the rooms earlier.

1609
01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.600 line:82%
There's nothing here, right?

1610
01:20:50.667 --> 01:20:52.200 line:82%
Right.

1611
01:20:53.233 --> 01:20:54.700 line:82%
What's in this unit?

1612
01:20:58.033 --> 01:21:01.000 line:82%
What's in this unit?

1613
01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:04.400 line:82%
What is he doing?

1614
01:21:04.467 --> 01:21:07.133 line:82%
-Hey.
-You know, I really think…

1615
01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:12.934 line:82%
-Hey.
-You know, I really think…

1616
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.834 line:82%
Hold on. Hey, mister.

1617
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.533 line:82%
-What?
-There's a leak.

1618
01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:20.367 line:82%
-There's a leak.
-What?

1619
01:21:20.433 --> 01:21:22.166 line:82%
-Stop.
-He's washing his face.

1620
01:21:22.233 --> 01:21:23.667 line:82%
I'm washing my face.

1621
01:21:23.734 --> 01:21:25.000 line:82%
-Come on out.
-I was hot.

1622
01:21:25.066 --> 01:21:26.333 line:82%
What's in here?

1623
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.133 line:82%
Can't I wash my face to cool down?

1624
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.700 line:82%
-What's in here?
-Nothing.

1625
01:21:30.767 --> 01:21:32.166 line:82%
I feel refreshed.

1626
01:21:32.867 --> 01:21:34.066 line:82%
What's in here?

1627
01:21:34.834 --> 01:21:36.200 line:82%
-Did you open it?
-Yes, I did.

1628
01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:38.367 line:82%
-It's empty.
-It's empty, right?

1629
01:21:38.433 --> 01:21:40.500 line:82%
I guess someone took it already.

1630
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.400 line:82%
-Their team has it.
-It seems that way.

1631
01:21:45.266 --> 01:21:46.800 line:82%
Come on. Come into the room.

1632
01:21:46.867 --> 01:21:49.834 line:82%
Their purpose was crystal clear.

1633
01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:50.800 line:82%
Here's what we saw.

1634
01:21:50.867 --> 01:21:53.700 line:82%
They dug a hole
to reconstruct an apartment

1635
01:21:53.767 --> 01:21:54.767 line:82%
and found something.

1636
01:21:54.834 --> 01:21:56.767 line:82%
-A two-syllable word.
-Two syllables.

1637
01:21:56.834 --> 01:22:00.367 line:82%
But someone stole it.

1638
01:22:00.433 --> 01:22:02.100 line:82%
Did you find it?

1639
01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:05.266 line:82%
-That team took it already.
-It was empty.

1640
01:22:05.834 --> 01:22:07.100 line:82%
They know the secret.

1641
01:22:07.166 --> 01:22:08.600 line:82%
They already know it.

1642
01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:11.800 line:82%
-Did they search the unit and find it?
-I think so.

1643
01:22:11.867 --> 01:22:13.900 line:82%
But it makes no sense.

1644
01:22:13.967 --> 01:22:15.967 line:82%
It hasn't been long since we got the clue.

1645
01:22:16.033 --> 01:22:17.567 line:82%
The clue. Yes.

1646
01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:19.133 line:82%
-They couldn't have known.
-Right.

1647
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.533 line:82%
It's pure gold.

1648
01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.734 line:82%
-See? It's gold.
-But…

1649
01:22:44.967 --> 01:22:46.700 line:82%
Gosh, it could've ended badly.

1650
01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.333 line:82%
"In 1998,

The construction company employee

1659

Kim was handed over to the police

Kiwi. I can't find a kiwi-related item.

Unit 406.

The other unit?

Keep them from coming here.

1677
01:24:44.133 --> 01:24:47.834 line:82%
I'll put away the golden pig
and other items.

1678

Okay.

1679

Gosh, it's heavy.

1680
01:24:52.767 --> 01:24:54.066 line:82%
Gold.

1681
01:24:56.934 --> 01:24:58.233 line:82%
I need to use the bathroom.

1682

Could there be a meaning behind it?

1683
01:25:03.667 --> 01:25:05.600 line:82%
There must be something.

1684
01:25:28.533 --> 01:25:30.033 line:82%
…but the retrieved gold

1685
01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:32.166 line:82%
has gone missing again.

1686
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.333 line:82%
Now, we know that the item is gold.

1687
01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.100 line:82%
-We're looking for gold.
-Gold.

1688
01:25:36.166 --> 01:25:38.233 line:82%
I think the other team knows it too.

1690

you can take out two gold bars at a time.

1692
01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:51.500 line:82%
You can put in two gold bars at a time.

-Did they move the gold bars?
-There were ten.

1694
01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.133 line:82%
There were ten,
but I don't know where they went.

1695

Danger Man?

1696
01:25:59.166 --> 01:26:01.266 line:82%
Shall we turn it on?
Maybe the video works.

1697
01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.500 line:82%
There was 5 kg. What does it mean?
Is there 5 kg of gold?

1698
01:26:07.567 --> 01:26:08.834 line:82%
I didn't watch the hint.

1699
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.233 line:82%
On the tape,

1700
01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:14.100 line:82%
it only said, "Unit 406."
That was why I came back right away.

Didn't you say something?

1705
01:26:56.834 --> 01:26:59.400 line:82%
These movies must hold a clue.

1706
01:27:08.166 --> 01:27:09.767 line:82%
It's an announcement.

1707

1715
01:27:32.667 --> 01:27:36.734 line:82%
Among you there are people who know
about the secret of the gold bars.

1716
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.734 line:82%
The two construction company employees.

1717
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.734 line:82%
Two construction company employees.

1718
01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.266 line:82%
Among us?

1719
01:27:49.333 --> 01:27:51.567 line:82%
-Is that so?
-Hey.

1720
01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:54.734 line:82%

1722
01:27:59.333 --> 01:28:01.700 line:82%

-Hold on.

1723
01:28:01.767 --> 01:28:03.333 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-My goodness.

1724
01:28:04.033 --> 01:28:05.100 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-It isn't me.

1725
01:28:05.166 --> 01:28:06.233 line:82%
There are two.

1726
01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.000 line:82%
-It isn't me. Seriously.
-Tae-hyun.

1727
01:28:08.066 --> 01:28:10.166 line:82%
-So they've been playing with us?
-Yes.

1728
01:28:10.233 --> 01:28:12.266 line:82%
-There are two employees.
-It isn't me.

1729
01:28:12.333 --> 01:28:13.533 line:82%
-What? JENNIE.
-No way.

1730
01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.967 line:82%
-It really isn't me.
-Seriously.

1731
01:28:16.033 --> 01:28:17.867 line:82%
-Does that mean you tricked me?
-It isn't me.

1732
01:28:17.934 --> 01:28:19.000 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-Jae-seok.

1733
01:28:19.066 --> 01:28:19.900 line:82%
Seriously.

1734
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.934 line:82%
Breaking news.

1735
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.867 line:82%
At 3 p.m. today
at an apartment construction site in Seoul

1736
01:28:27.934 --> 01:28:30.333 line:82%

due to a vein of gold,

1737
01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.400 line:82%
gold bars disappeared
and shocked everyone.

1738
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.900 line:82%
According to eyewitness accounts,

1739
01:28:36.967 --> 01:28:39.834 line:82%
two construction employees went missing.

1740
01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:43.567 line:82%
Since one of them ran away secretly
with the gold bars,

1741
01:28:43.633 --> 01:28:45.000 line:82%
the police began to investigate.

1742
01:28:45.066 --> 01:28:47.166 line:82%
To find the whereabouts
of the missing gold,

1743
01:28:47.233 --> 01:28:50.600 line:82%
the police are trying to get
the full story through witness accounts.

1744
01:28:51.166 --> 01:28:53.000 line:82%
This has been Park Ji-man of
KVN News
.

1745
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.066 line:82%
If one of the employees

1746
01:29:01.133 --> 01:29:03.734 line:82%
escapes with the briefcase of gold bars,

1747
01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.800 line:82%
he or she will take all the gold.

1748
01:29:07.867 --> 01:29:09.667 line:82%
If one of the residents

1749
01:29:09.734 --> 01:29:12.533 line:82%
finds the briefcase of gold bars
and escapes,

1750
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:16.467 line:82%
he or she will take all the gold.

1751
01:29:17.734 --> 01:29:19.667 line:82%
-I can't believe you.
-It isn't me.

1752
01:29:19.734 --> 01:29:21.567 line:82%
-It's you.
-Don't suspect me.

1753
01:29:21.633 --> 01:29:22.867 line:82%
-We--
-I shared information.

1754
01:29:22.934 --> 01:29:23.967 line:82%
-The three of us worked hard.
-You.

1755
01:29:24.567 --> 01:29:27.300 line:82%
-I can't believe you.
-I think it's him.

1756
01:29:27.367 --> 01:29:30.700 line:82%
Can't you believe me? Please believe me.
I really don't know.

1757
01:29:30.767 --> 01:29:32.166 line:82%
I feel so victimized.

1758
01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.500 line:82%
I'm not acting.

1759
01:29:34.567 --> 01:29:37.000 line:82%
I'm not acting. I'm serious.

1760
01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:41.400 line:82%
Other than the time I came here briefly,
I didn't do anything alone.

1761
01:29:41.467 --> 01:29:42.467 line:82%
Hey.

1762
01:29:43.266 --> 01:29:46.000 line:82%
-What is it?
-It isn't me.

1763
01:29:46.066 --> 01:29:48.667 line:82%
What? He's suspicious.

1764
01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.066 line:82%
It isn't me. Don't look at me.

1765
01:29:52.133 --> 01:29:54.400 line:82%
The bathroom? It really isn't me.

1766
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.433 line:82%
-Tae-hyun.
-My microphone. I don't have it on me.

1767
01:30:03.166 --> 01:30:04.500 line:82%
My microphone.

1768
01:30:04.567 --> 01:30:06.834 line:82%
A microphone? For goodness' sake.

1769
01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:08.533 line:82%
I thought he was a professional.

1770
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.266 line:82%
Unbelievable. While he was pooping…

1771
01:30:12.834 --> 01:30:16.300 line:82%
If all of us barge in,
they'll become suspicious.

1772
01:30:16.367 --> 01:30:19.266 line:82%
Are you saying that you'll go alone?
Jae-seok.

1773
01:30:19.333 --> 01:30:21.600 line:82%
-He's quicker to act now.
-I know.

1774
01:30:21.667 --> 01:30:22.834 line:82%
I'm nervous.

1775
01:30:25.266 --> 01:30:27.567 line:82%
-Can I use the bathroom?
-Now?

1776
01:30:27.633 --> 01:30:29.400 line:82%
-There's a camera.
-I see.

1777
01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.400 line:82%
Where is the briefcase hidden?

1778
01:30:40.467 --> 01:30:42.400 line:82%
Hold on. Did we hide it?

1779
01:30:42.467 --> 01:30:43.600 line:82%
-No.
-No?

1780
01:30:43.667 --> 01:30:48.033 line:82%
The two construction employees
who took the gold

1781
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.133 line:82%
-hid it somewhere.
-When did they hide…

1782
01:30:51.033 --> 01:30:53.333 line:82%
-I'm really sorry.
-It isn't me.

1783
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.834 line:82%
Se-chan, I'm sorry,
but it can't be anyone else.

1784
01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.567 line:82%
-It's you.
-It isn't me.

1785
01:30:57.633 --> 01:31:01.700 line:82%
-Jae-seok, I really left the microphone.
-The circumstances point to you.

1786
01:31:01.767 --> 01:31:04.800 line:82%
Se-chan, how many years
have you starred in variety shows?

1787
01:31:04.867 --> 01:31:07.433 line:82%
-Let me begin the interview.
-You little…

1788
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.133 line:82%
-How many years has it been?
-About ten years.

1789
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.166 line:82%
Is it common for an expert
to leave a microphone in the bathroom?

1790
01:31:13.233 --> 01:31:16.000 line:82%
It isn't common, but it does happen.
Right? Think about it.

1791
01:31:16.066 --> 01:31:17.400 line:82%
-It happens.
-Seriously.

1792
01:31:17.467 --> 01:31:21.400 line:82%
-Of course, there's a 2% chance.
-You know how it is.

1793
01:31:21.467 --> 01:31:25.000 line:82%
You only forget a microphone
when you leave it someplace else.

1794
01:31:25.066 --> 01:31:25.900 line:82%
Isn't that right?

1795
01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:29.300 line:82%
Does that mean someone hid it already?

1796
01:31:29.367 --> 01:31:31.400 line:82%
-Or are we--
-Someone hid it already.

1797
01:31:31.467 --> 01:31:32.767 line:82%
-We're looking for it.
-Yes.

1798
01:31:32.834 --> 01:31:34.734 line:82%
But that employee knows where it is.

1799
01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.367 line:82%
Of course.

1800
01:31:36.433 --> 01:31:37.567 line:82%
I think the rice cooker--

1801
01:31:37.633 --> 01:31:39.300 line:82%
So the gold…

1802
01:31:39.367 --> 01:31:40.400 line:82%
Come on.

1803
01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:42.734 line:82%
-…the rice cooker--
-So the gold…

1804
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.400 line:82%
-Come on.
-Hold on.

1805
01:31:44.467 --> 01:31:46.500 line:82%
It's one of us three.

1806
01:31:48.633 --> 01:31:50.667 line:82%
We need to suspect Jae-seok's backpack.

1807
01:31:50.734 --> 01:31:51.867 line:82%
-But--
-Jae-seok.

1808
01:31:51.934 --> 01:31:54.367 line:82%
-We can go to the rooftop, right?
-Yes, we can.

1809
01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.266 line:82%
-Se-chan, be honest.
-You're wrong.

1810
01:32:04.333 --> 01:32:05.667 line:82%
What if it isn't me?

1811
01:32:05.734 --> 01:32:06.834 line:82%
Then I…

1812
01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.300 line:82%
I can't help but suspect you from now on.

1813
01:32:09.867 --> 01:32:11.500 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1814
01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:13.967 line:82%
I'll be here. Tae-hyun, I'll be here.

1815
01:32:14.033 --> 01:32:17.033 line:82%
JENNIE is sure it's me.
You might as well go and find Jae-seok.

1816
01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.033 line:82%
-Where is Jae-seok?
-He went to the rooftop.

1817
01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.200 line:82%
-The rooftop?
-Hey, it might be

1818
01:32:20.266 --> 01:32:21.900 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-You let him go?

1819
01:32:21.967 --> 01:32:23.367 line:82%
He went to find the bag.

1820
01:32:23.433 --> 01:32:25.433 line:82%
You don't know if he plans to run away.

1821
01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:26.433 line:82%
I can't believe you.

1822
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.700 line:82%
It's game over if he escapes.

1823
01:32:33.033 --> 01:32:35.500 line:82%
-What? Jung-ha disappeared.
-Tae-hyun.

1824
01:32:35.567 --> 01:32:36.767 line:82%
It's him.

1825
01:32:44.166 --> 01:32:46.000 line:82%
It's him.

1826
01:32:46.066 --> 01:32:48.133 line:82%
He went downstairs. He did, right?

1827
01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.100 line:82%
He went downstairs.

1828
01:32:50.333 --> 01:32:53.600 line:82%
Jae-seok is alone on the rooftop.

1829
01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.500 line:82%
Why is no one watching him?

1830
01:33:00.633 --> 01:33:01.900 line:82%
Why are you so relaxed?

1831
01:33:01.967 --> 01:33:04.567 line:82%
-JENNIE, who are you?
-Yes?

1832
01:33:04.633 --> 01:33:06.500 line:82%
-Who are you?
-I…

1833
01:33:06.567 --> 01:33:08.467 line:82%
I'm investigating.

1834
01:33:08.533 --> 01:33:11.100 line:82%
-You're too-- Why are you so relaxed?
-JENNIE.

1835
01:33:11.166 --> 01:33:12.533 line:82%
-What's up with you?
-Tae-hyun.

1836
01:33:13.033 --> 01:33:15.233 line:82%
He didn't go downstairs. Where is he?

1837
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:16.900 line:82%
Maybe he's upstairs.

1838
01:33:16.967 --> 01:33:18.133 line:82%
Where is he?

1839
01:33:21.567 --> 01:33:24.233 line:82%
No one is here, right? I'm scared.

1840
01:33:24.934 --> 01:33:26.533 line:82%
Hey, what are you doing?

1841
01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.600 line:82%
No!

1842
01:33:28.834 --> 01:33:30.300 line:82%
No one is here, right?

1843
01:33:34.834 --> 01:33:36.300 line:82%
I'm scared.

1844
01:33:36.367 --> 01:33:38.066 line:82%
Hey, what are you doing?

1845
01:33:38.133 --> 01:33:40.300 line:82%
No!

1846
01:33:45.166 --> 01:33:47.100 line:82%
-No!
-What?

1847
01:33:48.066 --> 01:33:49.834 line:82%
-What's going on?
-He ran away!

1848
01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.433 line:82%
-It isn't you.
-It isn't me.

1849
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.633 line:82%
No!

1850
01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:57.667 line:82%
Mister.

1851
01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:01.967 line:82%
These gold bars are mine.

1852
01:34:10.633 --> 01:34:12.800 line:82%
"We welcome you to Woosang Apartment.

1853
01:34:12.867 --> 01:34:14.834 line:82%
Woosang Apartment holds a secret."

1854
01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.834 line:82%
I'm a construction company employee.

1855
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.367 line:82%
Okay.

1856
01:34:19.667 --> 01:34:21.800 line:82%
-Apartment.
-Sir.

1857
01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.533 line:82%
-Come on.
-Sir. Hold on.

1858
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.300 line:82%
It should be enough.

1859
01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:31.767 line:82%
All done.

1860
01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:34.367 line:82%
All right. Nice.

1861
01:34:34.433 --> 01:34:35.900 line:82%
My goodness.

1862
01:34:43.066 --> 01:34:44.700 line:82%
There's another employee.

1863
01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.000 line:82%
In that case…

1864
01:35:10.533 --> 01:35:13.567 line:82%
-Is there something there?
-What?

1865
01:35:13.633 --> 01:35:15.600 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-Searching.

1866
01:35:15.667 --> 01:35:17.633 line:82%
For what? Something must be in here.

1867
01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:19.600 line:82%
No.

1868
01:35:21.667 --> 01:35:25.800 line:82%
You know that unit 406 is the key.
Unit 406.

1869
01:35:25.867 --> 01:35:27.867 line:82%
-Unit 406.
-You know that unit 406 is the key.

1870
01:35:29.333 --> 01:35:31.233 line:82%
-Unit 406.
-Unit 406.

1871
01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.600 line:82%
If I take it in a thermos…

1872
01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.266 line:82%
-Tae-hyun.
-My microphone.

1873
01:35:38.333 --> 01:35:40.433 line:82%
A microphone? For goodness' sake.

1874
01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.166 line:82%
I thought he was a professional.

1875
01:35:42.233 --> 01:35:43.500 line:82%
Unbelievable.

1876
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.967 line:82%
Is that it? I don't know what to do.

1877
01:36:13.233 --> 01:36:15.700 line:82%
-Hey, Yang Se-chan.
-I'm sorry.

1878
01:36:15.767 --> 01:36:17.066 line:82%
You left it by the toilet.

1879
01:36:17.133 --> 01:36:20.133 line:82%
Gosh, my microphone.

1880
01:36:26.066 --> 01:36:27.834 line:82%
He went out!

1881
01:36:28.867 --> 01:36:31.734 line:82%
Tell me that it isn't Se-chan.

1882
01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.700 line:82%
Please. I'm going to feel so hurt.

1883
01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:39.066 line:82%
-It's over.
-Seriously, Se-chan.

1884
01:36:39.133 --> 01:36:41.033 line:82%
Isn't this too much?

1885
01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.633 line:82%
-Seriously.
-It's over, right?

1886
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:45.200 line:82%
Se-chan.

1887
01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:48.600 line:82%
Seriously. He escaped. It was him.

1888
01:36:48.667 --> 01:36:50.467 line:82%
He's so mean.

1889
01:36:50.533 --> 01:36:52.033 line:82%
CONGRATULATIONS
ON FINDING GOLD BARS

1890
01:36:52.667 --> 01:36:53.734 line:82%
My goodness.

1891
01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.233 line:82%
Tae-hyun.

1892
01:36:58.367 --> 01:36:59.934 line:82%
You're incredible.

1893
01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.533 line:82%
-What's Jae-seok doing?
-I don't know.

1894
01:37:05.633 --> 01:37:07.100 line:82%
What's Jae-seok doing?

1895
01:37:07.166 --> 01:37:09.166 line:82%
He went to the rooftop by himself.

1896
01:37:12.033 --> 01:37:13.734 line:82%
I don't think it's here.

1897
01:37:14.367 --> 01:37:15.433 line:82%
It's over.

1898
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.700 line:82%
Why?

1899
01:37:17.967 --> 01:37:20.166 line:82%
Who was it? For goodness' sake.

1900
01:37:24.934 --> 01:37:27.033 line:82%
JENNIE, is it over?

1901
01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.600 line:82%
It was Se-chan.

1902
01:37:29.166 --> 01:37:30.500 line:82%
That little…

1903
01:37:30.567 --> 01:37:31.934 line:82%
He behaved strangely, right?

1904
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.467 line:82%
Seriously. The microphone made no sense.

1905
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000 line:82%
-I'm a resident who found the briefcase.
-What?

1906
01:37:40.066 --> 01:37:42.934 line:82%
I'm not a construction company employee
but a resident who--

1907
01:37:44.133 --> 01:37:45.567 line:82%
A resident who--

1908
01:37:45.633 --> 01:37:47.133 line:82%
-What?
-You punk.

1909
01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.633 line:82%
-You jerk.
-Hey.

1910
01:37:49.667 --> 01:37:51.967 line:82%
It was so much work
to transfer those bars, you jerk.

1911
01:37:52.033 --> 01:37:53.767 line:82%
-What?
-Was it you?

1912
01:37:53.834 --> 01:37:55.934 line:82%
-What?
-Was it you?

1913
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.934 line:82%
-I knew it was the two of them.
-Really?

1914
01:37:59.233 --> 01:38:01.734 line:82%
He pulled the rug out from under my feet.
I did all the work.

1915
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.834 line:82%
Really?

1916
01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.500 line:82%
I did all the work.

1917
01:38:05.567 --> 01:38:08.367 line:82%
He readied the briefcase tastefully.
It was hidden

1918
01:38:08.433 --> 01:38:09.567 line:82%
under some clothes.

1919
01:38:09.633 --> 01:38:11.533 line:82%
It was begging to be picked up.

1920
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.800 line:82%
So I picked it up, hid it someplace quiet

1921
01:38:14.867 --> 01:38:16.033 line:82%
and carried it out later.

1922
01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:18.166 line:82%
I get it now.

1923
01:38:18.233 --> 01:38:20.066 line:82%
-Get what?
-Variety shows.

1924
01:38:21.066 --> 01:38:22.233 line:82%
Variety shows.

1925
01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:24.233 line:82%
What do you know?

1926
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:25.200 line:82%
I get it now.

1927
01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.433 line:82%
I'm so shocked.

1928
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.834 line:82%
Na-ra.

1929
01:38:30.033 --> 01:38:31.934 line:82%
-"The rooftop isn't it."
-I'll trust you only.

1930
01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.367 line:82%
-Trust me only.
-At that moment…

1931
01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.734 line:82%
At an apartment reconstruction site
in Mapo-gu, Seoul,

1932
01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.066 line:82%
a vein of gold was found.

1933
01:38:42.133 --> 01:38:44.567 line:82%
Since the move-in date was near,

1934
01:38:44.633 --> 01:38:46.900 line:82%
the Reconstruction Association
forwent an analysis

1935
01:38:46.967 --> 01:38:50.667 line:82%
and named the apartment
Mapo Gold Apartment.

1936
01:39:10.066 --> 01:39:12.233 line:82%
My heart dropped.

1937
01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:14.033 line:82%
-
We don't know what the topic will be.
-
No.

1938
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:16.667 line:82%
It's about a crime.

1939
01:39:16.734 --> 01:39:19.300 line:82%
"Increasing penalty levels for poisoning.

1940
01:39:19.367 --> 01:39:20.834 line:82%
Eradicating antisocial crimes.

1941
01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.834 line:82%
String of kidnappings
involving high school girls."

1942
01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:25.734 line:82%
Are we looking for a missing person today?

1943
01:39:26.433 --> 01:39:28.967 line:82%
Hello? Is that you, Mi-young?

1944
01:39:29.533 --> 01:39:30.567 line:82%
Who are you?

1945
01:39:30.633 --> 01:39:31.700 line:82%
Catch him!

1946
01:39:36.433 --> 01:39:37.266 line:82%
That startled me.

1947
01:39:37.834 --> 01:39:40.667 line:82%
"…time to listen to Lee Moon-sae."

1948
01:39:40.734 --> 01:39:42.066 line:82%
-Gosh.
-What?

1949
01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.734 line:82%
I did it.

1950
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000 line:82%
The phone is ringing.

1951
01:39:48.066 --> 01:39:49.667 line:82%
-Hold on. Hello?
-Hold on.

1952
01:39:50.967 --> 01:39:52.433 line:82%
-Hello?
-Let me listen as well.

1953
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.033 line:82%
What was it?

1954
01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.333 line:82%
-Why did you hang up?
-Why did you hang up?

1955
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.000 line:82%
-Come here.
-For goodness' sake.

1956
01:39:58.066 --> 01:39:59.033 line:82%
Unbelievable.

1957
01:39:59.533 --> 01:40:01.233 line:82%
Are you a delinquent?

1958
01:40:01.734 --> 01:40:03.700 line:82%
That isn't how you do it.

1959
01:40:03.767 --> 01:40:05.533 line:82%
Are they doing it out in the open?

1960
01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.333 line:82%
Na-ra, where are you going?

1961
01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.300 line:82%
You jerk, how dare you…

1962
01:40:09.367 --> 01:40:11.033 line:82%
Gosh, it's getting dirty.

1963
01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:13.834 line:82%
-Let's see.
-You're too much.

1964
01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.400 line:82%
Come on. Hey.

1965
01:40:15.467 --> 01:40:17.300 line:82%
Where is he?

1966
01:40:17.367 --> 01:40:18.567 line:82%
Yu Jae-seok is hitting people.

1967
01:40:18.633 --> 01:40:19.734 line:82%
Come on out.

1968
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.533 line:82%
No! Someone is hitting me.
