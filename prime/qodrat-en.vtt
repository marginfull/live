1
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.375 line:83%
I seek refuge in Allah

2
00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:35.458 line:83%
from the outcast Shaitan.

3
00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:47.042 line:83%
In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate.

4
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.792 line:83%
And to Allah belongs

5
00:00:54.875 --> 00:01:00.542 line:83%
the dominion of the heavens and the earth.

6
00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:09.167 line:83%
And to Allah is the destination.

7
00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:15.375 line:83%
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

8
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.042 line:83%
In the name of Allah…

9
00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:31.042 line:83%
…so fight against the allies of Shaitan.

10
00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:45.875 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah!

11
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.125 line:83%
In the name of Shaitan,

12
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.583 line:83%
I swore!

13
00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:17.792 line:83%
You'll suffer

14
00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:21.583 line:83%
from your guilt!

15
00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:48.708 line:83%
Alif.

16
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.292 line:83%
Help me.

17
00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.625 line:83%
Help me.

18
00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:02.625 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

19
00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:11.167 line:83%
As Su'ala.

20
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.292 line:83%
Enemy of Allah.

21
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.833 line:83%
Praise be to Allah.

22
00:04:41.542 --> 00:04:44.833 line:83%
In the dawn, you'll find sustenance.

23
00:04:46.292 --> 00:04:50.583 line:83%
In the dawn, you'll find solutions.

24
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.208 line:83%
-Ath…
-At-Talaq.

25
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.042 line:83%
Verses 2 and 3.

26
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.792 line:83%
I know that.

27
00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:03.750 line:83%
Seek Allah's forgiveness, Qodrat.

28
00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:09.167 line:83%
It's been almost three years since
Allah gave you His blessing.

29
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.750 line:83%
To wake up each dawn.

30
00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:14.792 line:83%
I never asked to be woken up.

31
00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:21.125 line:83%
I also never asked
to be released from this hell.

32
00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:24.500 line:83%
Qodrat!

33
00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:27.542 line:83%
I've been here for decades.

34
00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:31.375 line:83%
You're the only inmate to get a remission.

35
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.833 line:83%
You'll soon be a free man.

36
00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:38.042 line:83%
This blessing should make you remember

37
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.667 line:83%
-…that Allah…
-I have nothing left out there.

38
00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:50.000 line:83%
After Azizah.

39
00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:54.250 line:83%
Then Alif.

40
00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:58.667 line:83%
He took everything I had.

41
00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:28.042 line:83%
Help!

42
00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:29.375 line:83%
Help!

43
00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:30.750 line:83%
Help!

44
00:07:06.208 --> 00:07:08.958 line:83%
I already told you.

45
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.500 line:83%
You'll suffer for the rest of your life.

46
00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:20.042 line:83%
The only way

47
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:24.333 line:83%
you can get out of this hell, Qodrat,

48
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.542 line:83%
is inside a body bag.

49
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:40.333 line:83%
As Su'ala!

50
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.375 line:83%
Qodrat! Help!

51
00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:01.208 line:83%
Help!

52
00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:02.833 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

53
00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:05.875 line:83%
-Hold him.
-Let go.

54
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.333 line:83%
Quick!

55
00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:18.708 line:83%
Qodrat, wake up!

56
00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:37.208 line:83%
Allah is the greatest.

57
00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:13.917 line:83%
Allah is the greatest.

58
00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:28.417 line:83%
There is no god but Allah.

59
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:39.458 line:83%
There is no god but Allah.

60
00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:49.875 line:83%
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.

61
00:09:51.583 --> 00:10:01.125 line:83%
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.

62
00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:11.625 line:83%
Hasten to prayer.

63
00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:20.042 line:83%
Hasten to prayer.

64
00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:31.875 line:83%
Hasten to victory.

65
00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:42.042 line:83%
Hasten to victory.

66
00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:55.583 line:83%
Allah is the greatest.

67
00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:07.542 line:83%
There's no god except Allah.

68
00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:05.292 line:83%
Mama!

69
00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:42.583 line:83%
Mama!

70
00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:51.083 line:83%
Let's go!

71
00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:01.500 line:83%
THIS LAND BELONGS TO PESANTREN KAHURIPAN
LOCALS ARE NOT ALLOWED

72
00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:06.583 line:83%
Come, hurry up.

73
00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:09.083 line:83%
Come on.

74
00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:49.292 line:83%
Thank you.

75
00:16:55.042 --> 00:16:56.375 line:83%
How's Jihan?

76
00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:03.917 line:83%
She's getting worse.

77
00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:11.375 line:83%
She's even paler.

78
00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.583 line:83%
She has a fever.

79
00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:21.417 line:83%
She doesn't want to eat.

80
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.625 line:83%
She wakes up in the middle
of the night screaming in pain.

81
00:17:27.792 --> 00:17:32.208 line:83%
If not for you and the others…

82
00:17:37.542 --> 00:17:40.083 line:83%
I wouldn't know what to do.

83
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.125 line:83%
Ti…

84
00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:57.625 line:83%
Aside from coming to today's prayers,

85
00:17:57.708 --> 00:17:59.792 line:83%
I also need to see you.

86
00:18:01.292 --> 00:18:06.000 line:83%
Sorry, but I need you to pay back
your debt to my late husband.

87
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.417 line:83%
I haven't paid my children's tuition
for three months now.

88
00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:13.917 line:83%
-The farm is not producing. No harvest.
-Yas!

89
00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:18.167 line:83%
You're not the only one.

90
00:18:18.917 --> 00:18:22.083 line:83%
Nobody's farm in this village
is producing any crops.

91
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.500 line:83%
Jihan!

92
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.125 line:83%
-Jihan!
-Jihan.

93
00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:32.625 line:83%
Jihan!

94
00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:34.083 line:83%
Jihan!

95
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.875 line:83%
Jihan!

96
00:18:38.375 --> 00:18:40.000 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

97
00:18:40.542 --> 00:18:41.625 line:83%
Jihan.

98
00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:44.375 line:83%
Look at Mom! Enough!

99
00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:47.125 line:83%
Enough, please! Have mercy on your mother!

100
00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:50.667 line:83%
That's enough, Jihan!

101
00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:55.792 line:83%
That's enough, my child! It's Mom.

102
00:18:56.167 --> 00:18:59.917 line:83%
Please… that's enough, my love.

103
00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:07.125 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

104
00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:09.042 line:83%
Enough.

105
00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:11.292 line:83%
Jihan, enough!

106
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.375 line:83%
Enough, Jihan!

107
00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:17.167 line:83%
Have mercy on your mother. Please.

108
00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:22.417 line:83%
Jihan?

109
00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:24.250 line:83%
Jihan?

110
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.792 line:83%
Jihan!

111
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:29.792 line:83%
My god, Jihan!

112
00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:34.375 line:83%
Jihan!

113
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.500 line:83%
Jihan!

114
00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:45.542 line:83%
Jihan!

115
00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:37.917 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

116
00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:58.500 line:83%
One, two.

117
00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:03.958 line:83%
-I hit it, right?
-You're okay, right?

118
00:21:04.042 --> 00:21:06.042 line:83%
-You're fine.
-Come on, stand up.

119
00:21:06.125 --> 00:21:09.125 line:83%
I told you, you'll be fine.

120
00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:11.000 line:83%
Peace be unto you.

121
00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:12.083 line:83%
Who are you?

122
00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:14.000 line:83%
How dare you trespass here.

123
00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:17.000 line:83%
-Pardon my intrusion. I'm…
-Qodrat!

124
00:21:18.708 --> 00:21:20.125 line:83%
Good Lord!

125
00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:22.875 line:83%
Jafar.

126
00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.125 line:83%
When did they let you out?

127
00:21:36.792 --> 00:21:37.875 line:83%
I got a remission.

128
00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:41.292 line:83%
Thank goodness.

129
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.125 line:83%
Jafar, why is the
pesantren
in this condition?

130
00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:51.000 line:83%
Where's Kyai Rochim?

131
00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:56.458 line:83%
Since you left…

132
00:21:58.458 --> 00:22:01.167 line:83%
At first, he was fine.

133
00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:06.958 line:83%
Even when he heard news about you,

134
00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:10.667 line:83%
he'd be smiling proudly.

135
00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.333 line:83%
Until…

136
00:22:22.792 --> 00:22:24.667 line:83%
Until Alif's death three years ago.

137
00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:29.083 line:83%
We're all convinced,
that was not an ordinary accident.

138
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.958 line:83%
Every night he recited remembrances

139
00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:35.583 line:83%
and did night prayers just for you.

140
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.083 line:83%
He neglected his own health.

141
00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:42.750 line:83%
Then, one day, for no reason,

142
00:22:44.542 --> 00:22:45.958 line:83%
he fell ill.

143
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.958 line:83%
The villagers started experiencing
strange things.

144
00:22:54.083 --> 00:22:56.667 line:83%
The crops were infested.

145
00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.708 line:83%
Floods came. Diseases.

146
00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:03.167 line:83%
Even evil disturbances.

147
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.875 line:83%
Were these attacks
related to Kyai Rochim's illness?

148
00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:16.792 line:83%
I don't know.

149
00:23:26.333 --> 00:23:27.917 line:83%
What happened, Qodrat?

150
00:23:31.083 --> 00:23:33.708 line:83%
You and your unbelievable gift.

151
00:23:35.458 --> 00:23:37.583 line:83%
You, who never fails to exorcise people.

152
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:41.708 line:83%
You saved countless lives because of it.

153
00:23:43.667 --> 00:23:45.708 line:83%
And this is what we got in return?

154
00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:52.250 line:83%
What sin did you commit,

155
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.042 line:83%
that Alif became the victim?

156
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.917 line:83%
Ustadz.

157
00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:06.542 line:83%
I have to go.

158
00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:10.458 line:83%
You'll sleep at the
pesantren
?

159
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000 line:83%
Yes.

160
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.875 line:83%
Forgive me, teacher.

161
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:54.750 line:83%
Mom, I'm full.

162
00:24:54.833 --> 00:24:57.000 line:83%
The food was delicious.

163
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:03.042 line:83%
Why is your face like that?

164
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.792 line:83%
Nothing.

165
00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:13.708 line:83%
-I just miss you, Alif.
-If you miss me, why are you sad?

166
00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:15.958 line:83%
You should smile.

167
00:25:16.958 --> 00:25:19.208 line:83%
That's better.

168
00:25:22.667 --> 00:25:25.625 line:83%
Why isn't my sister Asha home yet, Mom?

169
00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:31.542 line:83%
So, you'll be playing with me, Mom?

170
00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:34.417 line:83%
Go to bed after you've finished dinner.

171
00:25:36.917 --> 00:25:40.458 line:83%
If you don't want to,
I'm gonna play with Dad.

172
00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:21.375 line:83%
Dad.

173
00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:23.875 line:83%
Where is it, Dad?

174
00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:25.125 line:83%
Alif.

175
00:26:25.958 --> 00:26:27.500 line:83%
Go to bed now.

176
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.000 line:83%
What's his name, Dad?

177
00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:36.000 line:83%
Who is with you, Dad?

178
00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:37.542 line:83%
Alif?

179
00:26:43.333 --> 00:26:44.583 line:83%
What are you doing?

180
00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:53.000 line:83%
I'm playing with Dad.

181
00:26:54.375 --> 00:26:57.125 line:83%
If you miss Dad, that's not how you play.

182
00:27:03.958 --> 00:27:05.125 line:83%
Peace be unto you.

183
00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.375 line:83%
And unto you peace.

184
00:27:12.708 --> 00:27:14.250 line:83%
Where have you been?

185
00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:19.208 line:83%
I told you before, Mom.

186
00:27:19.792 --> 00:27:21.792 line:83%
I went to the plantation
before going home.

187
00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:24.958 line:83%
You shouldn't be out this late, Asha.

188
00:27:25.583 --> 00:27:28.625 line:83%
You know how the village is nowadays.

189
00:27:29.917 --> 00:27:32.208 line:83%
Stop exaggerating like the others, Mom.

190
00:27:32.583 --> 00:27:33.583 line:83%
Asha.

191
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:50.833 line:83%
Jihan passed away this afternoon.

192
00:27:56.042 --> 00:27:58.500 line:83%
-I went there for the prayers…
-Mom.

193
00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:01.792 line:83%
I told you, Jihan was sick.

194
00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:05.292 line:83%
-She needed a doctor, not some spells!
-Seek Allah's forgiveness, Asha!

195
00:28:05.375 --> 00:28:07.792 line:83%
Those are prayers, not spells.

196
00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:10.208 line:83%
What are spells?

197
00:28:23.125 --> 00:28:24.542 line:83%
Have you eaten, Alif?

198
00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:27.833 line:83%
Now go to sleep, Alif.

199
00:28:28.167 --> 00:28:30.375 line:83%
I still want to talk to Mom.

200
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:32.833 line:83%
Having a talk or a fight?

201
00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:37.625 line:83%
-A talk.
-Sounds like a fight.

202
00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:39.708 line:83%
Come on, go to sleep.

203
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.875 line:83%
The village is in a dire state.

204
00:28:46.917 --> 00:28:50.375 line:83%
Crops failed. Many got sick.

205
00:28:54.792 --> 00:28:55.917 line:83%
Now, Alif.

206
00:28:56.958 --> 00:28:57.958 line:83%
Did you know?

207
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.458 line:83%
He's started talking to the wardrobe.

208
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.208 line:83%
He said he was playing with Dad.

209
00:29:04.292 --> 00:29:05.875 line:83%
There are only the three of us now.

210
00:29:06.708 --> 00:29:10.625 line:83%
I only have you and Alif.

211
00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:13.500 line:83%
Why we should live like we're in prison?

212
00:29:13.583 --> 00:29:15.667 line:83%
Alif…

213
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.333 line:83%
We have to believe
everything will be better.

214
00:29:19.208 --> 00:29:21.375 line:83%
Alif should have hope, not fear.

215
00:29:22.417 --> 00:29:24.000 line:83%
We need money.

216
00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:30.667 line:83%
That's why I kept trying to earn money.

217
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.625 line:83%
For your and Alif's tuitions.

218
00:29:34.375 --> 00:29:36.167 line:83%
So you can go to college in town.

219
00:29:37.167 --> 00:29:39.917 line:83%
So we won't have to sell
Dad's plantations.

220
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.500 line:83%
What did you say?
Your life is like a prison?

221
00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:50.958 line:83%
I'm sure there are solutions
for everything.

222
00:29:51.625 --> 00:29:53.250 line:83%
But we shouldn't stay silent.

223
00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.292 line:83%
We shouldn't lose to the fear that…

224
00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:58.708 line:83%
Did you forget what happened because
of your hope and courage for living?

225
00:30:04.917 --> 00:30:06.375 line:83%
I know!

226
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.458 line:83%
Our family is not complete
because of Asha, right?

227
00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:11.542 line:83%
Alif is paralyzed because of me, right?

228
00:30:12.083 --> 00:30:13.417 line:83%
If any…

229
00:30:20.417 --> 00:30:22.583 line:83%
-Alif!
-Alif!

230
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.125 line:83%
-Alif!
-Alif!

231
00:30:26.208 --> 00:30:27.958 line:83%
Alif!

232
00:30:28.042 --> 00:30:29.792 line:83%
-Alif!
-Let's move him.

233
00:30:30.167 --> 00:30:33.333 line:83%
-Alif!
-Alif!

234
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.792 line:83%
Alif!

235
00:30:39.125 --> 00:30:40.750 line:83%
He's got a fever, Sha.

236
00:30:41.458 --> 00:30:44.542 line:83%
-Alif!
-I'll get a cold towel.

237
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:46.417 line:83%
-Make hot sweet tea too.
-All right.

238
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.458 line:83%
Alif, wake up, son.

239
00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:52.750 line:83%
Son. It's Mom. Wake up. Alif!

240
00:30:52.833 --> 00:30:56.083 line:83%
Alif, do you hear me? Open your eyes.

241
00:30:56.167 --> 00:30:58.250 line:83%
Alif!

242
00:31:13.792 --> 00:31:15.417 line:83%
Alif.

243
00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:20.292 line:83%
Yesterday, I went to the plantation
because I missed Dad.

244
00:31:22.125 --> 00:31:23.125 line:83%
Look, Alif.

245
00:31:26.833 --> 00:31:28.333 line:83%
I drew this.

246
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.083 line:83%
Dad used to tell me stories.

247
00:31:32.708 --> 00:31:34.917 line:83%
This was the yard for you to play in.

248
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.833 line:83%
Alif still has a fever?

249
00:31:40.958 --> 00:31:43.042 line:83%
Yes, Mom. He still has a fever.

250
00:31:52.875 --> 00:31:54.875 line:83%
Go to school, you'll be late.

251
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.417 line:83%
Sha, I'm…

252
00:32:00.708 --> 00:32:01.917 line:83%
Me too, Mom.

253
00:32:02.792 --> 00:32:03.875 line:83%
Me too.

254
00:32:09.792 --> 00:32:12.292 line:83%
-Peace be unto you.
-And unto you peace.

255
00:32:22.292 --> 00:32:23.958 line:83%
Where's my wardrobe?

256
00:32:27.667 --> 00:32:31.000 line:83%
I moved it into storage.

257
00:32:31.458 --> 00:32:33.167 line:83%
We will buy a new one later.

258
00:32:37.125 --> 00:32:40.000 line:83%
Alif, I made this for you.

259
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:41.917 line:83%
Have a bite. Come on, eat.

260
00:32:46.458 --> 00:32:48.208 line:83%
Why did you do that?

261
00:32:52.417 --> 00:32:54.292 line:83%
If you don't want it, just say so.

262
00:32:57.917 --> 00:33:00.792 line:83%
I'll cook your favorite dish.

263
00:33:01.083 --> 00:33:02.208 line:83%
Get some rest.

264
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.875 line:83%
Glory be to Allah
and all praise be to Allah.

265
00:33:14.958 --> 00:33:16.958 line:83%
There is none worthy
of worship except Allah.

266
00:33:17.042 --> 00:33:20.250 line:83%
Glory be to Allah
and all praise be to Allah.

267
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:22.875 line:83%
Glory be to Allah…

268
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.583 line:83%
Where's Alif?

269
00:34:07.542 --> 00:34:09.875 line:83%
-What is it, Mom?
-Where's Alif?

270
00:34:10.417 --> 00:34:12.792 line:83%
I don't know. He's not with me.

271
00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.667 line:83%
Alif!

272
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.708 line:83%
Alif!

273
00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:24.875 line:83%
-Alif!
-Alif!

274
00:34:27.083 --> 00:34:29.167 line:83%
-Alif!
-I mean it.

275
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.250 line:83%
I'm not lying.

276
00:34:31.958 --> 00:34:33.042 line:83%
Alif?

277
00:34:33.458 --> 00:34:35.625 line:83%
I want to go with you.

278
00:34:38.542 --> 00:34:39.875 line:83%
Really?

279
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.208 line:83%
We can just play together.

280
00:34:43.292 --> 00:34:45.125 line:83%
I want to go with you.

281
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:47.125 line:83%
What are you doing here, Alif?

282
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.125 line:83%
We've been looking everywhere for you.

283
00:34:55.458 --> 00:34:56.542 line:83%
Dad said

284
00:34:57.583 --> 00:34:59.833 line:83%
that I don't need the others.

285
00:34:59.917 --> 00:35:01.375 line:83%
Alif, that's enough.

286
00:35:01.458 --> 00:35:02.625 line:83%
As long as I obey him,

287
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.750 line:83%
Dad said I can walk again.

288
00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:09.917 line:83%
Dad is gone. He's dead!

289
00:35:11.708 --> 00:35:15.083 line:83%
Don't talk trash about Dad!

290
00:35:30.333 --> 00:35:31.958 line:83%
Alif!

291
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:35.708 line:83%
Alif, it's me! It's Mom, son!

292
00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:39.833 line:83%
Dad is dead!

293
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.667 line:83%
Shut up, you bitch!

294
00:35:49.042 --> 00:35:51.583 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah!

295
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.250 line:83%
-Alif!
-Mom!

296
00:36:15.708 --> 00:36:18.000 line:83%
Why did you lock him up, Mom? Alif!

297
00:36:18.083 --> 00:36:20.083 line:83%
Watch the door! Don't let him out.

298
00:36:20.167 --> 00:36:22.125 line:83%
-Why are you leaving him?
-Wait till I get back!

299
00:36:23.667 --> 00:36:24.875 line:83%
Alif!

300
00:36:36.583 --> 00:36:39.083 line:83%
Peace be unto you!

301
00:36:40.583 --> 00:36:43.083 line:83%
Peace be unto you! Help!

302
00:36:43.875 --> 00:36:46.083 line:83%
-And unto you peace.
-Help.

303
00:36:46.167 --> 00:36:47.917 line:83%
Just a moment.

304
00:36:48.958 --> 00:36:53.333 line:83%
-I need to see Ustadz Jafar now!
-Be calm, ma'am. Seek Allah's forgiveness.

305
00:36:53.417 --> 00:36:56.208 line:83%
-How did you get wounded?
-Where's Ustadz Jafar?

306
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.917 line:83%
He's out, I don't know where.

307
00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:01.250 line:83%
Are you an Ustadz?

308
00:37:01.708 --> 00:37:04.333 line:83%
My son is possessed. Please exorcise him.

309
00:37:04.417 --> 00:37:06.875 line:83%
I beg you! Help him.

310
00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:10.958 line:83%
Sorry, Ma'am. You can come back
when Ustadz Jafar returns.

311
00:37:11.042 --> 00:37:13.167 line:83%
-Excuse me.
-I can pay you!

312
00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:21.417 line:83%
As I said before,

313
00:37:21.833 --> 00:37:24.500 line:83%
you can come back
when Ustadz Jafar is back.

314
00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:26.083 line:83%
-Please leave.
-Please, Ustadz, I can't.

315
00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:27.625 line:83%
-I'll give him your message.
-I can't lose my son!

316
00:37:27.708 --> 00:37:29.292 line:83%
Please help him, Ustadz!

317
00:37:35.292 --> 00:37:36.625 line:83%
Please, help my son.

318
00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:44.042 line:83%
Open up. Open the door, sis.

319
00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:54.875 line:83%
What did I do wrong?

320
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.333 line:83%
Why are you mean like Mom?

321
00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:04.250 line:83%
-Mom locked you up, not me.
-Liar!

322
00:38:04.333 --> 00:38:07.250 line:83%
You're the one who wants to lock me up.

323
00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:13.458 line:83%
You and Mom always left me alone at home.

324
00:38:13.542 --> 00:38:16.250 line:83%
No. I love you, Alif.

325
00:38:16.583 --> 00:38:18.125 line:83%
If you love me,

326
00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:24.000 line:83%
why don't you celebrate
your birthday with the family?

327
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.958 line:83%
Dad and I went looking for you.

328
00:38:30.042 --> 00:38:32.250 line:83%
I love you, Alif.

329
00:38:34.833 --> 00:38:36.292 line:83%
If you love me,

330
00:38:37.083 --> 00:38:40.042 line:83%
why did you make me paralyzed?

331
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.708 line:83%
If you love me,

332
00:38:45.208 --> 00:38:48.958 line:83%
why did you cause the accident that night?

333
00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:55.542 line:83%
Dad was right.

334
00:38:57.167 --> 00:39:01.958 line:83%
You and Mom don't love me anymore.

335
00:39:08.958 --> 00:39:11.583 line:83%
Dad's gone, Alif!

336
00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:13.417 line:83%
Dad is here.

337
00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:16.958 line:83%
You still don't believe me?

338
00:39:19.042 --> 00:39:20.750 line:83%
Come see for yourself.

339
00:39:34.458 --> 00:39:35.542 line:83%
Alif?

340
00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:47.583 line:83%
Come here, sis.

341
00:39:49.083 --> 00:39:52.208 line:83%
Come here. You said you loved me.

342
00:40:00.292 --> 00:40:02.167 line:83%
Alif, come on out.

343
00:40:03.417 --> 00:40:05.167 line:83%
Let's go home.

344
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.292 line:83%
I don't want to.

345
00:40:06.875 --> 00:40:08.708 line:83%
I want to play with Dad.

346
00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:11.125 line:83%
Listen to me, Alif.

347
00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:12.500 line:83%
Come out now!

348
00:40:12.958 --> 00:40:14.417 line:83%
All right.

349
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:17.208 line:83%
But give me back my feet!

350
00:40:55.375 --> 00:40:57.958 line:83%
Let's put it here.

351
00:40:58.458 --> 00:41:00.542 line:83%
Looks nice in here.

352
00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:03.750 line:83%
Looks nice.

353
00:41:04.667 --> 00:41:08.125 line:83%
We're busted, Mom.

354
00:41:09.417 --> 00:41:12.625 line:83%
-Happy birthday, Asha.
-Happy birthday, sweetie.

355
00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:20.000 line:83%
Happy birthday, Asha.

356
00:41:22.167 --> 00:41:25.542 line:83%
Dad and Alif were going to pick you up.

357
00:41:26.708 --> 00:41:30.625 line:83%
But it seems my gorgeous daughter
has come home.

358
00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:34.833 line:83%
What's wrong, Asha?

359
00:41:35.708 --> 00:41:38.083 line:83%
Tell Daddy all about it.

360
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.625 line:83%
Don't cry.

361
00:42:15.208 --> 00:42:18.792 line:83%
May Asha be smarter, more mature,

362
00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:21.792 line:83%
and a great and famous painter.

363
00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:24.667 line:83%
And love Alif even more.

364
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:28.583 line:83%
And I hope we can always be together.

365
00:42:29.583 --> 00:42:32.958 line:83%
So, I can always celebrate your birthday.

366
00:42:34.208 --> 00:42:35.292 line:83%
Always, Dad.

367
00:42:36.417 --> 00:42:38.000 line:83%
But now.

368
00:42:39.708 --> 00:42:41.542 line:83%
Let's cut the cake.

369
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:47.125 line:83%
So all of our prayers and hopes

370
00:42:47.417 --> 00:42:48.917 line:83%
can come true.

371
00:43:16.708 --> 00:43:18.667 line:83%
What's wrong, Asha?

372
00:43:20.875 --> 00:43:23.167 line:83%
I don't know. Suddenly, my hand hurts.

373
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.250 line:83%
If everything is all right…

374
00:43:28.792 --> 00:43:30.917 line:83%
then come on, cut the cake.

375
00:43:32.292 --> 00:43:34.250 line:83%
Come on. Try again.

376
00:43:34.917 --> 00:43:38.667 line:83%
-But it hurts.
-It's okay. Just do it slowly.

377
00:43:40.333 --> 00:43:42.333 line:83%
Mom?

378
00:43:44.542 --> 00:43:45.792 line:83%
Let me help.

379
00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:18.625 line:83%
Don't stop.

380
00:44:19.583 --> 00:44:21.542 line:83%
-But it hurts, Dad!
-Again.

381
00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:23.250 line:83%
-Mom.
-Again!

382
00:44:25.292 --> 00:44:27.375 line:83%
You don't want me to leave again, right?

383
00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:30.417 line:83%
Don't want to lose me again, right?

384
00:44:34.375 --> 00:44:35.958 line:83%
Then,

385
00:44:37.542 --> 00:44:38.833 line:83%
cut the cake.

386
00:44:39.542 --> 00:44:40.625 line:83%
Cut!

387
00:44:41.292 --> 00:44:42.417 line:83%
Cut!

388
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.125 line:83%
Asha?

389
00:44:54.708 --> 00:44:56.083 line:83%
Mom?

390
00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.292 line:83%
Mom?

391
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.125 line:83%
Asha!

392
00:45:05.042 --> 00:45:06.333 line:83%
Mom?

393
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.125 line:83%
Mom!

394
00:45:19.625 --> 00:45:21.000 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

395
00:45:23.292 --> 00:45:26.250 line:83%
Asha…

396
00:45:28.542 --> 00:45:30.375 line:83%
It hurts, Dad.

397
00:45:33.917 --> 00:45:36.750 line:83%
In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate.

398
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.583 line:83%
There is neither might nor power
but with Allah.

399
00:46:00.042 --> 00:46:02.167 line:83%
Asha.

400
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.958 line:83%
Mom.

401
00:46:21.917 --> 00:46:25.667 line:83%
Endure it, Asha. Endure it.

402
00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:33.542 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

403
00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:34.958 line:83%
-Oh, Lord.
-Alif.

404
00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:42.667 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

405
00:46:47.042 --> 00:46:48.167 line:83%
Who are you?

406
00:46:48.792 --> 00:46:50.708 line:83%
Alif.

407
00:46:52.542 --> 00:46:53.792 line:83%
Who are you?

408
00:46:56.292 --> 00:46:57.542 line:83%
Tell me your name!

409
00:47:04.667 --> 00:47:07.417 line:83%
You're a hypocrite, Son of Adam!

410
00:47:08.708 --> 00:47:11.250 line:83%
You call on Allah's name,

411
00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:14.208 line:83%
but you have no faith in Him.

412
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.583 line:83%
You kneel to Allah,

413
00:47:20.458 --> 00:47:23.625 line:83%
but you question His power.

414
00:47:31.167 --> 00:47:32.500 line:83%
Alif!

415
00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:38.792 line:83%
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

416
00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:40.875 line:83%
In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate.

417
00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:44.417 line:83%
Those who believe do battle
for the cause of Allah

418
00:47:45.458 --> 00:47:48.417 line:83%
and those who disbelieve
do battle for the cause of idols.

419
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.208 line:83%
So, fight the minions of the devil…

420
00:47:51.292 --> 00:47:53.625 line:83%
You're beneath me!

421
00:47:54.042 --> 00:47:58.000 line:83%
Remember, hypocrites belong in hell.

422
00:47:58.083 --> 00:47:59.583 line:83%
…the devil's strategy is ever weak.

423
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.542 line:83%
Once again, tell me your name.

424
00:48:09.625 --> 00:48:11.292 line:83%
Khadaab!

425
00:48:13.167 --> 00:48:14.667 line:83%
What's your faith?

426
00:48:15.042 --> 00:48:17.083 line:83%
Dajjalul Mustafan.

427
00:48:17.167 --> 00:48:19.833 line:83%
I only worship Shaitan.

428
00:48:20.167 --> 00:48:21.833 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

429
00:48:24.458 --> 00:48:25.458 line:83%
Alif!

430
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:35.542 line:83%
Glory be to Allah
and all praise be to Allah.

431
00:48:35.625 --> 00:48:37.292 line:83%
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah, and Allah is the Greatest!

432
00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:41.958 line:83%
You'll convert to Islam.

433
00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:50.750 line:83%
With Allah's permission,
leave this child's body.

434
00:48:51.875 --> 00:48:54.042 line:83%
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

435
00:48:54.125 --> 00:48:56.750 line:83%
In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate.

436
00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:58.792 line:83%
O company of jinn and men.

437
00:48:58.875 --> 00:49:03.000 line:83%
If ye have the power to penetrate
all regions of the heavens and the earth,

438
00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:06.500 line:83%
then penetrate them! Ye will never
penetrate them save with our sanction.

439
00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:09.583 line:83%
Which is it, of the favors of your Lord,
that ye deny?

440
00:49:10.792 --> 00:49:11.917 line:83%
Just you wait!

441
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.833 line:83%
Soon, those who are stronger will come

442
00:49:15.917 --> 00:49:20.458 line:83%
to destroy Muhammad's people.

443
00:49:20.542 --> 00:49:23.500 line:83%
There is neither might nor power
but with Allah.

444
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.042 line:83%
Alif?

445
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.125 line:83%
Alif!

446
00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:36.875 line:83%
Thank you, Allah.

447
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:42.917 line:83%
My job is done.

448
00:49:44.458 --> 00:49:45.958 line:83%
Thank you.

449
00:49:48.125 --> 00:49:49.333 line:83%
Ustadz.

450
00:49:51.167 --> 00:49:52.250 line:83%
Qodrat.

451
00:49:54.417 --> 00:49:55.875 line:83%
My name is Qodrat.

452
00:50:20.375 --> 00:50:22.167 line:83%
As Su'ala.

453
00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:27.792 line:83%
Help me, Dad.

454
00:51:19.792 --> 00:51:20.958 line:83%
What's wrong, Mom?

455
00:51:21.042 --> 00:51:22.042 line:83%
Asha!

456
00:51:47.958 --> 00:51:49.042 line:83%
Dear Lord.

457
00:51:50.625 --> 00:51:51.792 line:83%
Dear Lord.

458
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:16.958 line:83%
Asha!

459
00:52:18.833 --> 00:52:21.500 line:83%
Find Ustadz Qodrat. Quick!

460
00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:23.000 line:83%
Mom!

461
00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:28.167 line:83%
Mom? It's Alif.

462
00:52:31.708 --> 00:52:33.083 line:83%
Mom?

463
00:52:36.875 --> 00:52:37.917 line:83%
Good evening.

464
00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:40.458 line:83%
We've come for Alif.

465
00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:51.875 line:83%
Wait!

466
00:52:53.542 --> 00:52:54.833 line:83%
Jafar?

467
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.833 line:83%
Where's Alif?

468
00:52:57.458 --> 00:52:58.458 line:83%
Alif!

469
00:52:59.375 --> 00:53:00.375 line:83%
Alif!

470
00:53:00.458 --> 00:53:01.583 line:83%
Alif!

471
00:53:01.667 --> 00:53:04.458 line:83%
-Alif!
-Qodrat!

472
00:53:04.542 --> 00:53:06.625 line:83%
-What are you doing?
-I must save Alif. There's no time.

473
00:53:06.708 --> 00:53:08.417 line:83%
Qodrat! Let's talk.

474
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.167 line:83%
-There's no time. I must save Alif.
-Alif?

475
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.375 line:83%
-I must save him.
-He's my responsibility now.

476
00:53:13.458 --> 00:53:15.750 line:83%
You don't know who you're dealing with.

477
00:53:15.833 --> 00:53:18.917 line:83%
He's a sorcerer.
A direct descendant of Shaitan.

478
00:53:20.333 --> 00:53:21.458 line:83%
As Su'ala.

479
00:53:28.042 --> 00:53:29.458 line:83%
Jafar!

480
00:53:29.875 --> 00:53:31.458 line:83%
Look at Alif, Jafar!

481
00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:33.750 line:83%
Look!

482
00:53:33.833 --> 00:53:35.625 line:83%
He is feasting on our faith!

483
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.667 line:83%
Our lives are just his playthings.

484
00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:43.625 line:83%
The jinn I eradicated from Alif's body
was only one of his henchmen.

485
00:53:45.208 --> 00:53:46.583 line:83%
So, please.

486
00:53:46.917 --> 00:53:48.458 line:83%
Let me exorcise Alif.

487
00:53:49.042 --> 00:53:52.667 line:83%
Qodrat, every day I exorcise
the villagers in this village,

488
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.292 line:83%
so I know more about…

489
00:53:54.375 --> 00:53:56.333 line:83%
But that's the infidel jinn
that murdered my son!

490
00:54:00.792 --> 00:54:02.500 line:83%
He also tried to kill me in the prison.

491
00:54:02.917 --> 00:54:04.792 line:83%
And now he's here in the village.

492
00:54:06.833 --> 00:54:07.833 line:83%
Please.

493
00:54:08.292 --> 00:54:11.125 line:83%
That's why I don't need your help.

494
00:54:11.667 --> 00:54:13.333 line:83%
Look at that kid.

495
00:54:15.167 --> 00:54:16.458 line:83%
He's Alif Amri.

496
00:54:17.708 --> 00:54:19.417 line:83%
Not Alif Al-Fathanah.

497
00:54:19.792 --> 00:54:23.000 line:83%
And for now, he's still breathing.

498
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.625 line:83%
Don't make the same mistake twice.

499
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.625 line:83%
Look deep within your heart.

500
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.125 line:83%
Are you helping in the name of Allah,

501
00:54:40.833 --> 00:54:42.708 line:83%
or for your revenge?

502
00:54:53.417 --> 00:54:55.417 line:83%
I testify there is no god except Allah.

503
00:54:56.708 --> 00:54:58.542 line:83%
I testify Muhammad is Allah's messenger.

504
00:55:07.208 --> 00:55:08.958 line:83%
Peace be unto you.

505
00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:40.083 line:83%
Why us, Ustadz?

506
00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:42.667 line:83%
Why Alif?

507
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:45.667 line:83%
Seek Allah's forgiveness, Sha.

508
00:55:46.792 --> 00:55:48.750 line:83%
That's what Shaitan wants.

509
00:55:49.792 --> 00:55:51.750 line:83%
For us to doubt Allah.

510
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.583 line:83%
Allah is the greatest.

511
00:55:56.125 --> 00:55:58.458 line:83%
And Islam is the perfect religion.

512
00:55:59.625 --> 00:56:01.292 line:83%
But you and me…

513
00:56:02.583 --> 00:56:04.625 line:83%
We're weak.

514
00:56:06.542 --> 00:56:09.708 line:83%
Every day, we breathe to reach heaven,
but we forget.

515
00:56:11.542 --> 00:56:13.958 line:83%
We don't realize we're full of sins.

516
00:56:14.875 --> 00:56:17.167 line:83%
Is there a place for me in heaven?

517
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:28.750 line:83%
I have caused harm
to the two people I love the most.

518
00:56:34.167 --> 00:56:35.708 line:83%
Did you do it on purpose?

519
00:56:38.542 --> 00:56:40.958 line:83%
Allah knows everything we have done.

520
00:56:42.417 --> 00:56:45.292 line:83%
And everything we did
will have consequences.

521
00:56:47.167 --> 00:56:49.583 line:83%
But not in our human minds.

522
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.583 line:83%
We don't have the right to question.

523
00:56:54.375 --> 00:56:58.125 line:83%
Allah won't burden humans
beyond their limits.

524
00:56:59.292 --> 00:57:02.125 line:83%
Allah does not burden a soul
beyond its capacity.

525
00:57:03.333 --> 00:57:07.000 line:83%
Each will enjoy what good he earns.

526
00:57:09.333 --> 00:57:11.083 line:83%
You can recite the Qur'an?

527
00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:18.125 line:83%
Praise be to Allah.

528
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:25.500 line:83%
-What are you doing here?
-Peace unto you, sir.

529
00:57:25.583 --> 00:57:28.000 line:83%
-Peace unto you.
-You're from Pesantren Kahuripan?

530
00:57:28.083 --> 00:57:29.708 line:83%
Yes, that's correct.

531
00:57:30.167 --> 00:57:32.583 line:83%
So, you're one of Jafar's men.

532
00:57:33.167 --> 00:57:34.417 line:83%
Tell him!

533
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.750 line:83%
My daughter is dead!

534
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:38.917 line:83%
So, there's no one to exorcise anymore.

535
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.333 line:83%
Wait, sir. I don't understand.

536
00:57:40.417 --> 00:57:42.000 line:83%
If Jihan were alive

537
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:44.167 line:83%
and you still took
our land and plantations,

538
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:48.750 line:83%
we'd still die anyway from starving
because there's nothing left.

539
00:57:48.833 --> 00:57:50.542 line:83%
-Do you know that?
-Wait, sir. What land?

540
00:57:50.625 --> 00:57:52.167 line:83%
The whole village knows!

541
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:54.417 line:83%
You're using religion for your greed!

542
00:57:55.042 --> 00:57:59.500 line:83%
For wealth and money! Go away!
Go away from here!

543
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:02.958 line:83%
The village has become a dreadful place
because of your people!

544
00:58:03.042 --> 00:58:04.583 line:83%
-Ustadz!
-Enough, sir.

545
00:58:05.833 --> 00:58:07.083 line:83%
Go away!

546
00:58:31.458 --> 00:58:35.208 line:83%
Tanti!

547
00:58:46.708 --> 00:58:49.500 line:83%
-Mom!
-Sha, that's Alif.

548
00:58:50.042 --> 00:58:53.000 line:83%
-Alif!
-Praise be to Allah.

549
00:58:53.083 --> 00:58:55.625 line:83%
-Thank you.
-Your son has been healed.

550
00:59:06.708 --> 00:59:08.208 line:83%
Thank goodness.

551
00:59:09.333 --> 00:59:11.833 line:83%
Alif's exorcism went well.

552
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.417 line:83%
He can go home now.

553
00:59:16.875 --> 00:59:19.875 line:83%
-What did you get from Yasmin's family?
-Let's go.

554
00:59:21.042 --> 00:59:22.542 line:83%
Money?

555
00:59:23.917 --> 00:59:25.708 line:83%
Or a piece of their land?

556
00:59:27.917 --> 00:59:29.792 line:83%
Who told you that nonsense?

557
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.250 line:83%
-That's slander.
-That's blackmail.

558
00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:38.167 line:83%
-They were gifts from the villagers.
-You robbed them!

559
00:59:39.667 --> 00:59:42.708 line:83%
-They gave it themselves.
-If they don't give it, you won't help.

560
00:59:43.417 --> 00:59:44.917 line:83%
Just like Tanti's daughter.

561
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.333 line:83%
It was only a matter of time for Jihan.

562
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:52.833 line:83%
-Many villagers need my help.
-So, who do you help first?

563
00:59:54.417 --> 00:59:55.875 line:83%
Those who can pay? Am I right?

564
00:59:56.958 --> 01:00:00.375 line:83%
The land and plantations
that I asked from them

565
01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:02.875 line:83%
are for the new
pesantren

566
01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:04.292 line:83%
and a new mosque.

567
01:00:05.042 --> 01:00:08.250 line:83%
You said it yourself,
why is this
pesantren
a mess?

568
01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:13.375 line:83%
I want to make this
pesantren
alive again.

569
01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:15.250 line:83%
All of it is useless…

570
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.833 line:83%
if the people around here
are living in misery because of you.

571
01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:21.792 line:83%
Which is more important?

572
01:00:21.875 --> 01:00:23.333 line:83%
A new
pesantren

573
01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:25.500 line:83%
or the greater good?

574
01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.875 line:83%
Don't touch Yasmin's land and plantations.

575
01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:49.333 line:83%
And never again
ask for payment for exorcism.

576
01:00:51.167 --> 01:00:52.625 line:83%
It's our duty, Jafar.

577
01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.375 line:83%
Don't disgrace Kyai Rochim.

578
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.625 line:83%
Kobar.

579
01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:05.375 line:83%
Go pack Ustadz Qodrat's things.

580
01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:09.500 line:83%
He's too holy to stay here.

581
01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:11.208 line:83%
Yes, Ustadz.

582
01:01:24.125 --> 01:01:26.208 line:83%
What kind of horse gets tired the most?

583
01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:30.000 line:83%
Sis?

584
01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:35.333 line:83%
-I'm sorry, Alif.
-No.

585
01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:43.167 line:83%
-Alif, will you forgive me?
-No.

586
01:01:43.708 --> 01:01:47.583 line:83%
-Forgive me. You'll forgive me, right?
-Yes, stop it.

587
01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:50.542 line:83%
-Forgive me.
-Stop it!

588
01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.542 line:83%
Why aren't you asleep?

589
01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:55.667 line:83%
-Mom, look at what Asha did.
-Why me?

590
01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:58.500 line:83%
Alif.

591
01:01:59.042 --> 01:02:03.208 line:83%
Ustadz Jafar said a prayer
over this water for you to drink.

592
01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:06.042 line:83%
A spell, right?

593
01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:08.583 line:83%
A prayer, not a spell.

594
01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:10.375 line:83%
So, what is a spell?

595
01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:13.333 line:83%
Say, "In the name of Allah, the merciful
and compassionate," before drinking.

596
01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:17.792 line:83%
Oh, you're right. "In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate."

597
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.875 line:83%
Sha. I need to talk to you about payment…

598
01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:29.208 line:83%
Mom.

599
01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.375 line:83%
-I'm gonna check it out.
-I'm coming with you.

600
01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.292 line:83%
Stay here with Asha.

601
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:39.917 line:83%
-Mom!
-I'm here. Calm down.

602
01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:06.500 line:83%
Where's Mom?

603
01:06:07.583 --> 01:06:09.500 line:83%
What's taking her so long?

604
01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:18.542 line:83%
-Alif, what horse…
-No.

605
01:06:25.208 --> 01:06:27.542 line:83%
-Wait here, Alif.
-Sis!

606
01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:30.250 line:83%
Sister!

607
01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:38.875 line:83%
-Sis!
-Just a moment, Alif.

608
01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:47.250 line:83%
Mom?

609
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.500 line:83%
Mom?

610
01:06:52.625 --> 01:06:53.625 line:83%
Sis?

611
01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:57.000 line:83%
Is that Mom?

612
01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:11.458 line:83%
-Mom?
-Sis!

613
01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:13.292 line:83%
Be patient, Alif.

614
01:07:20.542 --> 01:07:21.750 line:83%
Mom?

615
01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:31.292 line:83%
-Mom?
-Asha?

616
01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:35.458 line:83%
Is that Mom, sis?

617
01:07:36.542 --> 01:07:38.875 line:83%
Mom?

618
01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:52.708 line:83%
Asha.

619
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:02.167 line:83%
Mom? Why…

620
01:08:02.542 --> 01:08:04.875 line:83%
Go to the
pesantren
now
and find Ustadz Jafar.

621
01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:08.083 line:83%
-Now, Mom?
-Now, Asha.

622
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.625 line:83%
All right. Peace be upon you.

623
01:08:16.083 --> 01:08:17.375 line:83%
Asha. Sister!

624
01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:23.292 line:83%
Sis?

625
01:08:24.542 --> 01:08:26.042 line:83%
Where are you, sis?

626
01:08:44.792 --> 01:08:46.167 line:83%
Please forgive me, Kyai.

627
01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:49.208 line:83%
I have to go.

628
01:08:52.417 --> 01:08:53.833 line:83%
I'm ashamed that I can't do anything
for this
pesantren
.

629
01:08:53.917 --> 01:08:56.125 line:83%
Qodrat…

630
01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:00.750 line:83%
Glory be to Allah.

631
01:09:03.708 --> 01:09:05.208 line:83%
Kyai?

632
01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:13.042 line:83%
Jafar…

633
01:09:14.042 --> 01:09:16.375 line:83%
Idols.

634
01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:21.208 line:83%
It's late. Kyai Rochim need his rest.

635
01:09:21.708 --> 01:09:24.042 line:83%
-You should go now.
-Kyai.

636
01:09:25.708 --> 01:09:27.167 line:83%
-Wake up, Kyai.
-Hey!

637
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:34.667 line:83%
-Where's Jafar?
-Ustadz Jafar is busy, so please leave.

638
01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:36.250 line:83%
Hey!

639
01:09:38.708 --> 01:09:39.708 line:83%
Hey!

640
01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:49.958 line:83%
Hey!

641
01:09:58.375 --> 01:10:01.042 line:83%
Go home while you still can.

642
01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:03.833 line:83%
Thank you.

643
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.083 line:83%
Jafar!

644
01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:27.667 line:83%
I'll summon this spell for jinn and ghost.

645
01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:31.625 line:83%
I worship Shaitan with all my heart.

646
01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:35.583 line:83%
Give all your power to me.

647
01:10:36.958 --> 01:10:41.083 line:83%
I made these sacrifices to please you.

648
01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:44.083 line:83%
So, please receive it.

649
01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:46.833 line:83%
Give me the power to rule the world.

650
01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:54.208 line:83%
For all Shaitan…

651
01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:58.042 line:83%
…jinn and ghost.

652
01:10:58.125 --> 01:11:02.542 line:83%
I give it all to you.

653
01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:05.417 line:83%
The soul of Alif Amri.

654
01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:14.500 line:83%
Take it all to complete the ritual.

655
01:11:20.083 --> 01:11:21.542 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

656
01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:24.792 line:83%
Welcome, Qodrat.

657
01:11:26.917 --> 01:11:28.458 line:83%
Jafar, you infidels!

658
01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:38.375 line:83%
Hypocrite! All of this time,
you said Allah's name, but…

659
01:11:42.333 --> 01:11:44.958 line:83%
Since when have you heard me
reciting Allah's verses?

660
01:11:52.167 --> 01:11:56.625 line:83%
I forget when the last time was
that I said His name.

661
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:06.375 line:83%
All this time you lived off
this
pesantren
and Kyai Rochim.

662
01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:09.125 line:83%
This is how you repay him?

663
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.375 line:83%
Lived? Rats are alive too.

664
01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.292 line:83%
Drink this blood.

665
01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:56.167 line:83%
Follow me.

666
01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:58.750 line:83%
We'll worship As Su'ala.

667
01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:04.625 line:83%
You filth!

668
01:13:10.292 --> 01:13:12.042 line:83%
One more time.

669
01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:14.167 line:83%
Follow me.

670
01:13:15.167 --> 01:13:16.583 line:83%
Worship As Su'ala.

671
01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:23.542 line:83%
Or I'll force you to worship As Su'ala.

672
01:13:25.583 --> 01:13:30.625 line:83%
We worship You, Allah, alone,

673
01:13:32.417 --> 01:13:34.292 line:83%
and no one else.

674
01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:40.458 line:83%
And only in Allah do I seek protection.

675
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:47.250 line:83%
Then it's your fate
to die by my hand today!

676
01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:35.167 line:83%
Ustadz!

677
01:15:59.625 --> 01:16:02.000 line:83%
What are you doing to me, Mom?

678
01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:05.750 line:83%
I can't move.

679
01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:20.917 line:83%
Why can't I move, Mom?

680
01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:25.417 line:83%
Enough, Mom.

681
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.125 line:83%
Help.

682
01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:38.917 line:83%
Mom?

683
01:16:50.042 --> 01:16:52.708 line:83%
-Mom?
-Asha!

684
01:16:59.542 --> 01:17:00.875 line:83%
Where's Alif, Mom?

685
01:17:03.125 --> 01:17:04.792 line:83%
Where's Alif?

686
01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:09.708 line:83%
A prophecy told me

687
01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:13.750 line:83%
there'd be one of Muhammad's people

688
01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:17.792 line:83%
who stood in the way
of my misleading human souls.

689
01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:21.000 line:83%
Where's Alif?

690
01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:33.792 line:83%
Every time, I failed to kill you.

691
01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:37.625 line:83%
Failed to overthrow your faith.

692
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:44.375 line:83%
But not today.

693
01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:48.208 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

694
01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:59.917 line:83%
Peace be unto you, Ustadz Qodrat.

695
01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:08.083 line:83%
Mom!

696
01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:14.500 line:83%
In the name of Allah and Prophet Muhammad,
where's Alif?

697
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:17.750 line:83%
Which Alif?

698
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.833 line:83%
The one whose neck I broke?

699
01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:29.917 line:83%
Or the Alif I just buried alive?

700
01:18:30.625 --> 01:18:34.375 line:83%
Alif!

701
01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:45.333 line:83%
As Su'ala. Allah have mercy.

702
01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:06.708 line:83%
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

703
01:19:06.792 --> 01:19:08.958 line:83%
In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate.

704
01:19:09.042 --> 01:19:11.625 line:83%
Your god is one god;
there is no god save Him.

705
01:19:11.708 --> 01:19:14.833 line:83%
…the Beneficent, the Merciful.

706
01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.583 line:83%
In the creation of the heavens
and the earth.

707
01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:19.875 line:83%
And the difference of night and day.

708
01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:25.833 line:83%
And the ships which run upon the sea
with that which is of use to men, and…

709
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:31.333 line:83%
Repent.

710
01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.625 line:83%
I seek forgiveness in Allah.

711
01:19:42.792 --> 01:19:46.708 line:83%
And the water which Allah
sendeth down from the sky,

712
01:19:46.792 --> 01:19:49.542 line:83%
thereby reviving the earth
after its death,

713
01:19:49.625 --> 01:19:56.625 line:83%
and dispersing all kinds
of beasts therein,

714
01:19:58.792 --> 01:20:02.167 line:83%
and in the ordinance of the winds

715
01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:05.167 line:83%
and the clouds obedient
between heaven and earth,

716
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:09.208 line:83%
are signs of Allah's sovereignty

717
01:20:09.292 --> 01:20:13.042 line:83%
for people who have sense.

718
01:20:30.417 --> 01:20:32.958 line:83%
In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate.

719
01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:46.875 line:83%
Ustadz!

720
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:13.375 line:83%
I'll kill all religious men.

721
01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:17.083 line:83%
So, no one will pray.

722
01:22:17.167 --> 01:22:20.000 line:83%
And the sound of
adhan
will vanish.

723
01:22:41.417 --> 01:22:43.750 line:83%
Allah is the best place
for us to surrender.

724
01:22:47.042 --> 01:22:49.083 line:83%
Our best protector and the best helper.

725
01:22:49.583 --> 01:22:51.458 line:83%
Glory be to Allah
and all praise be to Allah.

726
01:22:51.542 --> 01:22:52.708 line:83%
There is none worthy
of worship except Allah.

727
01:22:52.792 --> 01:22:54.000 line:83%
And Allah is the Greatest.

728
01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:55.458 line:83%
Glory be to Allah
and all praise be to Allah.

729
01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:56.708 line:83%
There is none worthy
of worship except Allah.

730
01:22:56.792 --> 01:22:58.042 line:83%
And Allah is the Greatest.

731
01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:02.875 line:83%
I won't let you mock Allah's verse.

732
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.375 line:83%
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

733
01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:07.875 line:83%
In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate.

734
01:23:07.958 --> 01:23:11.625 line:83%
Say O Muhammad: It is revealed unto me
that a company of the Jinn gave ear.

735
01:23:11.708 --> 01:23:15.125 line:83%
And they said: Lo! We have
heard a marvelous Qur'an

736
01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:25.458 line:83%
Allah is the greatest.

737
01:23:28.167 --> 01:23:30.625 line:83%
I testify that there's no god
except Allah.

738
01:23:58.375 --> 01:24:01.417 line:83%
which guideth unto righteousness

739
01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:08.042 line:83%
so we believe in it and we ascribe
no partner unto our Lord.

740
01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:23.167 line:83%
Mom!

741
01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:35.708 line:83%
Asha.

742
01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:39.417 line:83%
Asha.

743
01:24:44.083 --> 01:24:47.167 line:83%
Where's Alif?

744
01:24:51.417 --> 01:24:54.708 line:83%
Where's Alif, Sha?

745
01:25:18.583 --> 01:25:20.375 line:83%
-Alif!
-Mom!

746
01:25:20.458 --> 01:25:23.292 line:83%
-Alif!
-Mom!

747
01:25:23.375 --> 01:25:24.792 line:83%
Dig him up! Alif!

748
01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:29.250 line:83%
Dig, Sha. Get him out! Help me!

749
01:25:31.833 --> 01:25:33.833 line:83%
-Help him, Asha!
-Mom!

750
01:25:33.917 --> 01:25:38.375 line:83%
Save him! Alif!

751
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.375 line:83%
Alif!

752
01:25:41.458 --> 01:25:44.000 line:83%
My son! Wait for me!

753
01:25:45.708 --> 01:25:47.875 line:83%
Wait for me!

754
01:25:48.375 --> 01:25:52.833 line:83%
Asha! Help Alif!

755
01:25:58.333 --> 01:25:59.458 line:83%
Quick!

756
01:26:49.833 --> 01:26:51.792 line:83%
You came, Dad.

757
01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:56.333 line:83%
I knew you'd come to find me.

758
01:27:07.292 --> 01:27:08.625 line:83%
What's wrong, Dad?

759
01:27:10.042 --> 01:27:13.083 line:83%
I'm scared. It's dark down there.

760
01:27:13.167 --> 01:27:14.458 line:83%
Ustadz?

761
01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:17.500 line:83%
I'm alone there.

762
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.417 line:83%
Please come with me, Dad.

763
01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:27.333 line:83%
I don't want to lose you again.

764
01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:30.417 line:83%
And we'll find Mom there.

765
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.583 line:83%
And we'll be together again.

766
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.208 line:83%
Please help me, Dad.

767
01:27:38.417 --> 01:27:40.333 line:83%
Help me.

768
01:27:45.917 --> 01:27:47.458 line:83%
Help me.

769
01:27:54.458 --> 01:27:55.583 line:83%
Come on, Asha.

770
01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:13.375 line:83%
I love you, Alif.

771
01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:20.000 line:83%
I'll always miss you.

772
01:28:24.708 --> 01:28:29.292 line:83%
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

773
01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:32.875 line:83%
In the name of Allah,
the merciful and compassionate.

774
01:28:32.958 --> 01:28:37.125 line:83%
All praise to be to Allah.

775
01:28:37.208 --> 01:28:41.458 line:83%
Lord of all the Words.
King of the Day of Judgment.

776
01:28:41.542 --> 01:28:44.750 line:83%
You alone we worship,
and to you alone turn for help.

777
01:28:44.833 --> 01:28:47.792 line:83%
-Guide us, O Lord, to the straight path.
-But we all belong to Allah.

778
01:28:47.875 --> 01:28:50.750 line:83%
The path of those You blessed.

779
01:28:50.833 --> 01:28:54.542 line:83%
-Not of those who…
-And to Allah we shall return.

780
01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:12.750 line:83%
Indeed, to Allah we belong
and to Allah we shall return.

781
01:29:17.083 --> 01:29:19.375 line:83%
Blasted human!

782
01:29:24.458 --> 01:29:27.042 line:83%
If I can't destroy you,

783
01:29:27.875 --> 01:29:30.292 line:83%
I'll make you lose everything!

784
01:29:31.542 --> 01:29:34.208 line:83%
He said: Now, because
Thou hast sent me astray,

785
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.458 line:83%
verily I shall lurk in ambush for them
on Thy Right Path.

786
01:29:55.833 --> 01:29:58.000 line:83%
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Shaitan.

787
01:29:58.083 --> 01:29:59.917 line:83%
And I came to them…

788
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.125 line:83%
-…from the front, behind them…
-In the name of Allah…

789
01:30:03.208 --> 01:30:06.083 line:83%
-…left and right.
-Allah! There is no god but He.

790
01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:10.667 line:83%
-And you'll find most of them ungrateful.
-The Living, The Self-subsisting, Eternal.

791
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:14.000 line:83%
His are all things
in the heavens and on earth.

792
01:30:14.667 --> 01:30:18.292 line:83%
Who is there can intercede
in His presence except as He permitted?

793
01:30:18.375 --> 01:30:21.000 line:83%
He knoweth what appeareth
to His creatures as…

794
01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:23.375 line:83%
…before or after or behind them…

795
01:30:23.458 --> 01:30:25.625 line:83%
…nor shall they encompass aught
of His knowledge except as He willeth.

796
01:30:25.708 --> 01:30:27.875 line:83%
His throne doth extend over the heavens
and on earth.

797
01:30:27.958 --> 01:30:29.750 line:83%
And on earth, and He feeleth no fatigue
in guarding and preserving them…

798
01:30:29.833 --> 01:30:32.458 line:83%
…for He is the most high.
The Supreme in glory.

799
01:30:32.542 --> 01:30:35.917 line:83%
With Allah's permission,
come out from this child's body!

800
01:30:36.875 --> 01:30:39.667 line:83%
Let Allah punish you in the afterlife!

801
01:30:40.167 --> 01:30:44.750 line:83%
I testify that there's no god
except Allah.

802
01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:48.125 line:83%
And I testify that Prophet Muhammad
is Allah's messenger.

803
01:30:49.333 --> 01:30:52.750 line:83%
Allah is the greatest.

804
01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:57.458 line:83%
There is neither might nor power
but with Allah.

805
01:30:57.542 --> 01:30:59.583 line:83%
-Alif!
-Alif!

806
01:31:01.208 --> 01:31:02.917 line:83%
Alif!

807
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.583 line:83%
Indeed, to Allah we belong,
and to Allah we shall return.

808
01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:16.708 line:83%
-Walk slowly, Kyai.
-Let's go.

809
01:32:16.792 --> 01:32:18.750 line:83%
Allah willing, I'll stay healthy.

810
01:32:20.292 --> 01:32:22.417 line:83%
Can't you stay a little longer?

811
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:26.583 line:83%
Six months flies.

812
01:32:26.667 --> 01:32:28.708 line:83%
-Peace be unto you, Kyai.
-And peace unto you.

813
01:32:28.792 --> 01:32:30.792 line:83%
And peace unto you.

814
01:32:31.667 --> 01:32:33.667 line:83%
-Take care, Kyai Rochim.
-All right.

815
01:32:37.167 --> 01:32:40.167 line:83%
Almost every day
we fixed up this

01:32:40.958 --> 01:32:42.833 line:83%
I lost track of time.

817
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:48.292 line:83%
It's time for me to go.

818
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.667 line:83%
The time has come for me to find out
what happened to Azizah.

This journey is a mandate for bearing
the gift that Allah gave to you.

820
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:05.500 line:83%
But never forget this place,
and don't hesitate to come back.

821
01:33:07.125 --> 01:33:09.167 line:83%
Because this is your home.

822
01:33:11.083 --> 01:33:12.292 line:83%
Allah willing.

823
01:33:13.583 --> 01:33:14.583 line:83%
And

824
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:19.875 line:83%
for a while, before this old geezer…

825
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.167 line:83%
Let my old bike keep you company
on your journey.

826
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:34.417 line:83%
Good Lord!

827
01:33:37.875 --> 01:33:41.417 line:83%
-Thank you, Kyai.
-You're welcome.

828
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:44.875 line:83%
-I'll be going now.
-Take care.

829
01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:52.917 line:83%
There's no one comparable to Him.

830
01:34:11.625 --> 01:34:13.542 line:83%
Ustadz Qodrat!

831
01:34:54.125 --> 01:34:55.250 line:83%
Mom?

832
01:34:57.458 --> 01:35:00.250 line:83%
Ustadz Qodrat will be back, right?
