00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.126 line:80%
I...

2
00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:44.044 line:80%
had a crush on you!

3
00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.495 line:80%
What I mean is...

4
00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.122 line:80%
I...

5
00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:22.666 line:80%
Sorry.

GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

7
00:01:25.628 --> 00:01:28.255 line:80%
-Yes, sir?
-
I'm sorry to call on the weekend.

8
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.925 line:80%
But I think I need your help.

9
00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:34.011 line:80%
Do you have time to help me?

10
00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:38.057 line:80%
It's about the group's advertising budget.
I'm at Winton Hotel.

11
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.064 line:80%
Hello? Ms. Kang?

12
00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:48.818 line:80%
Right. I see.

13
00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.072 line:80%
I think I can get there in 30 minutes.

14
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:57.243 line:80%
Okay, I'll see you later.

15
00:01:57.827 --> 00:01:58.953 line:80%
Okay.

16
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.384 line:80%
Sorry, I really have to go.

17
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.638 line:80%
Yeah, okay.

18
00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.182 line:80%
By any chance...

19
00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:23.602 line:80%
Can I have your number?

20
00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:30.985 line:80%
Wait.

21
00:02:49.962 --> 00:02:51.005 line:80%
Bye.

22
00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.179 line:80%
Bye!

23
00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.213 line:80%
EPISODE 4

24
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:38.385 line:80%
Mr. Yu has never called me out
on a weekend before.

25
00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:51.315 line:80%
I'm sorry I'm late.

26
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.859 line:80%
You're not late. Thanks for coming.

27
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.446 line:80%
I'm sure of it. This has never happened.

28
00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.864 line:80%
Let's talk as we go.

29
00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:03.077 line:80%
There is a showcase going on right now.

30
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.664 line:80%
It's a proposal to shift
marketing expenses online.

31
00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:10.209 line:80%
-It will change our advertising strategy.
-A bold suggestion.

32
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.629 line:80%
Which means online marketing
must increase,

33
00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:17.216 line:80%
but the group is conservative
and says it's early to invest.

34
00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:19.885 line:80%
How can I help?

35
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.514 line:80%
Support my opinion.

36
00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.873 line:80%
It's NurTV! I can't believe it.

37
00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:53.210 line:80%
It will be a platform used by all ages
within ten years.

38
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.300 line:80%
Wow, this is...

39
00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.136 line:80%
I sense success here.

40
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.483 line:80%
Though not everyone may agree.

41
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.862 line:80%
Mr. Yu. You're here.

42
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:23.907 line:80%
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Wang.
This is Assistant Manager Kang Ji-won.

43
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:29.329 line:80%
So this is when U&K's power-tripping mole,
Wang Heung-in, was still here.

44
00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:30.497 line:80%
Do you know who I am?

45
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:34.752 line:80%
The so-called "Mole" executive
was filmed assaulting a crew member.

46
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.838 line:80%
It's spreading through social media
and causing a stir.

47
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.631 line:80%
What are you looking at?

48
00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:45.846 line:80%
Hello.

49
00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.557 line:80%
It's so interesting to meet you...

50
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.686 line:80%
I mean, it's an honor.

51
00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.233 line:80%
You know your stuff, Mr. Yu.

52
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.994 line:80%
It's smart to hire pretty girls.

53
00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:11.455 line:80%
It makes working more fun, doesn't it?

54
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:14.833 line:80%
I almost forgot.

55
00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:18.462 line:80%
Kim Gyeong-uk's connection
was the mole guy. They're similar.

56
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.131 line:80%
I bet working isn't fun for you here.

57
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.981 line:80%
I told you to be nicer to Ji-won.

58
00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.944 line:80%
Hey, are you really
a contract worker for U&K?

59
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.365 line:80%
Who said that? Was it Ji-won?

60
00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:50.744 line:80%
Yeah, she said you are a contract worker,
and she's an assistant manager.

61
00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:53.372 line:80%
Since we're on it, can I see your card?

62
00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.166 line:80%
Ji-won's an assistant manager,
so what are you?

63
00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.502 line:80%
I'm just a staff member.

64
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.337 line:80%
She got promoted quickly.

65
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.256 line:80%
-It's my turn--
-Are you joking?

66
00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.968 line:80%
How was she promoted first
if you got her the job?

67
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:09.680 line:80%
I bought you all the meals
for your job hunting tips,

68
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:13.517 line:80%
when you got your job through a referral?

69
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.979 line:80%
You said that the first, second,
and third interview rounds

70
00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.857 line:80%
for big companies
should be approached differently.

71
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:23.527 line:80%
Apart from all that,
what was it about dating Eun-ho?

72
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:29.283 line:80%
No one could even reach Eun-ho.
How did he come to the reunion?

73
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:36.081 line:80%
Are you still talking about that?

74
00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:39.042 line:80%
That was when we were kids. We're 31 now.

75
00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:41.837 line:80%
-Stop it.
-Are you kidding me?

76
00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:45.340 line:80%
You've been playing us with your lies.

77
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.719 line:80%
Is it true you gave Ji-won the knockoffs?

78
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.929 line:80%
It wasn't that she was copying you.

79
00:07:51.013 --> 00:07:53.640 line:80%
You're the one
that gave it to her as a gift!

80
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.853 line:80%
Why did she say all that?

81
00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.065 line:80%
Have you been trying to screw her over?

82
00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:09.865 line:80%
Why would I do that?

83
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.283 line:80%
I'm her friend.

84
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.911 line:80%
It's true.

85
00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:17.247 line:80%
It's your fault Ji-won was dissed
all through school.

86
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:21.293 line:80%
You said she stole your man, copied you,
and wanted all your things.

87
00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.794 line:80%
You were always whining!

88
00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.131 line:80%
I never told you to diss her.

89
00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:29.009 line:80%
You bullied her on your own,
don't come at me!

90
00:08:36.892 --> 00:08:38.685 line:80%
What a creatively

91
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.146 line:80%
crazy bitch.

92
00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.567 line:80%
I'm going to the restroom.

93
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.364 line:80%
-Can you believe her?
-Jeez.

94
00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.540 line:80%
When did I ask them to bully her?

95
00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:02.042 line:80%
Why are they blaming me?

96
00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:04.753 line:80%
What a bunch of losers!

97
00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.891 line:80%
OTHER HALF

98
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:30.195 line:80%
The person you are trying to call...

99
00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:31.405 line:80%
Darn it.

100
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.283 line:80%
Why did Eun-ho have to show up now?

101
00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:07.566 line:80%
Come on.

102
00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.943 line:80%
You think this is a joke?

103
00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:12.446 line:80%
Why do I pay you?

104
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:15.741 line:80%
Do I have to see this for you to decide?

105
00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.410 line:80%
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.787 line:80%
Still, it's a really...

107
00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:22.748 line:80%
A really good...

108
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.126 line:80%
I've accessed this site too.

109
00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:29.796 line:80%
What do you mean, it's good?
It's full of indecent content.

110
00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:43.393 line:80%
It seems the targeting effectiveness
works. It's called algorithm.

111
00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:47.064 line:80%
That's probably because
it was your first time on the site.

112
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:48.940 line:80%
What?

113
00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:51.902 line:80%
When I first accessed the site,

114
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.863 line:80%
He Was Delicious
was on.

115
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.740 line:80%
To attract attention at first,

116
00:10:56.823 --> 00:11:00.327 line:80%
the site recommends
provocative content first.

117
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.745 line:80%
As time passes,

118
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:05.332 line:80%
it will recommend content
that you're interested in.

119
00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.958 line:80%
It's actually pretty useful.

120
00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:10.170 line:80%
It keeps you from content
you're not interested in.

121
00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.963 line:80%
Hey.

122
00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.591 line:80%
Your job here is to smile like a flower.

123
00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.177 line:80%
Know your place and cut the chatter.

124
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.806 line:80%
She's Ms. Kang Ji-won, not "Hey".

125
00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.059 line:80%
What, Mr. Yu?

126
00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:27.729 line:80%
I called this promising employee in today
to hear her opinion.

127
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:30.565 line:80%
No, I mean...

128
00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.238 line:80%
Mr. Yu is giving you praise.

129
00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:40.367 line:80%
I know.
I've never heard him say that before.

130
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.701 line:80%
Mr. Yu is...

131
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.871 line:80%
so hard to approach
and doesn't keep anyone close.

132
00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:48.125 line:80%
A good and competent person
should be kept close.

133
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.715 line:80%
Did you just smile? Are you insane?

134
00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.969 line:80%
Are you in your right mind or not?

135
00:12:11.148 --> 00:12:12.149 line:80%
Mr. Yu?

136
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:16.069 line:80%
Thank you for your kinds words earlier.

137
00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:21.158 line:80%
It's because you're kind.

138
00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.955 line:80%
I wouldn't have said so if you weren't.

139
00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:36.840 line:80%
You said we could get girls
if we go camping!

140
00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.633 line:80%
We could.

141
00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.636 line:80%
But you can't.
You can't even get your girlfriend.

142
00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.724 line:80%
You struck out and had to go home.

143
00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.896 line:80%
So what? Is your wife any different?

144
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.107 line:80%
Man, my wife only cares about me.

145
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:55.942 line:80%
Whenever I leave the house,

146
00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:58.361 line:80%
she'll call and text nonstop.

147
00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.238 line:80%
"I miss you. What did you do?"

148
00:13:00.322 --> 00:13:03.825 line:80%
"Did you eat?" I'm so tired of it.

149
00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:05.118 line:80%
This one time...

150
00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.163 line:80%
Honestly, I don't get it.

151
00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.873 line:80%
She called me already

152
00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:13.001 line:80%
-only five minutes after I left home.
-What is this?

153
00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.794 line:80%
-It's good, right?
-Yeah.

154
00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.922 line:80%
My wife got that for me.

155
00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.759 line:80%
A delicious treat
to refresh myself without coffee.

156
00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:21.843 line:80%
That's nice.

157
00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:24.095 line:80%
Unlike your indifferent girlfriend.

158
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.180 line:80%
Damn it.

159
00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.184 line:80%
I think your girl is seeing another guy,

160
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.895 line:80%
and saving you for the marriage.

161
00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.481 line:80%
Who says she can't do it either?

162
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.150 line:80%
You don't know anything.

163
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:39.069 line:80%
She couldn't pull that off!

164
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.403 line:80%
What do you know...

165
00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:43.406 line:80%
Damn it.

166
00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:47.327 line:80%
Why are you taking that?

167
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.704 line:80%
Because it's good!
I'll use it for flirting!

168
00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.581 line:80%
-Stop the car.
-Come on.

169
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:54.876 line:80%
Get in.

170
00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:56.836 line:80%
That's okay.

171
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.463 line:80%
I'm not okay with it.

172
00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:01.550 line:80%
You didn't have to work
and hear all that nonsense.

173
00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.843 line:80%
I think I should treat you to a meal.

174
00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.660 line:80%
We're going to go eat if you keep that up.

175
00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.081 line:80%
What is it?

176
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.962 line:80%
Because you feel bad
over something like this.

177
00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:44.843 line:80%
There are people who were terrible to me,
and they're not sorry at all.

178
00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:48.221 line:80%
Don't get into the habit
of conforming to others.

179
00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.433 line:80%
Okay.

180
00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:55.854 line:80%
I learned I don't have to be good
to the people who treat me badly.

181
00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.858 line:80%
I'll use that energy
to be nicer to good people.

182
00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:02.569 line:80%
That's a good idea.

183
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.531 line:80%
All you need now is
to recognize the good ones.

184
00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.994 line:80%
How did you know
I was a terrible judge of character?

185
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:16.541 line:80%
I thought I was a good judge of character,
but I wasn't at all.

186
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.126 line:80%
So it seems.

187
00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.171 line:80%
What about me?

188
00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:29.220 line:80%
A good person.

189
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.723 line:80%
You're not that terrible.

190
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:36.394 line:80%
By the way,

191
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:40.190 line:80%
how was
"He Was Delicious"
?

192
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:45.904 line:80%
No.

193
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:50.283 line:80%
I was just saying that earlier
to make Mr. Wang feel better.

194
00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.202 line:80%
I don't know. It felt too real.

195
00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.496 line:80%
Tell me. Shall I watch it or not?

196
00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:55.622 line:80%
No, I swear...

197
00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.499 line:80%
I haven't seen it!

198
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.126 line:80%
This is unfair.

199
00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.672 line:80%
You must've watched it closely.

200
00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:05.757 line:80%
That's unfair. I mean it.

201
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.884 line:80%
I really didn't watch it.

202
00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.764 line:80%
OTHER HALF

203
00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.101 line:80%
REMIND ME LATER

204
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.686 line:80%
IN 1 HOUR
CALL DECLINED

205
00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.316 line:80%
If you had plans, I can take you there.

206
00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:26.736 line:80%
No need.

207
00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:37.038 line:80%
Sorry, I said I'd wait
but I'm texting again.

208
00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:40.250 line:80%
Seeing you after all this time,
I can't settle myself.

209
00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.714 line:80%
Someone must've said something funny.

210
00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.340 line:80%
A friend.

211
00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.175 line:80%
Who?

212
00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:50.969 line:80%
A friend from school.

213
00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.722 line:80%
I went to a high school reunion today.

214
00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:56.307 line:80%
It's been so long,
so we exchanged numbers.

215
00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.979 line:80%
It's momentarily nice
to see an old friend.

216
00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:03.815 line:80%
Even if it's all in the past.

217
00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.818 line:80%
I used to like him a lot.

218
00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:09.988 line:80%
He was my first love.

219
00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.121 line:80%
Well...

220
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:22.459 line:80%
You could be reminded of old feelings
when seeing him again,

221
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:23.668 line:80%
but it's dangerous.

222
00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:27.505 line:80%
So you should let go
of your old feelings...

223
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.299 line:80%
It's not like that.

224
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.344 line:80%
I have a boyfriend.

225
00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.279 line:80%
PARK MIN-HWAN

226
00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:52.447 line:80%
REMIND ME LATER
IN 1 HOUR

227
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.364 line:80%
CALL DECLINED

228
00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.040 line:80%
Ms. Kang?

229
00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.124 line:80%
Yes?

230
00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:35.448 line:80%
Everyone drives a nice car these days.

231
00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:37.450 line:80%
It's hard to see inside the car.

232
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.743 line:80%
What? No, I...

233
00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.829 line:80%
It's not for that reason.

234
00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:45.041 line:80%
-I thought you were trying to hide.
-No, why would I?

235
00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.400 line:80%
Su-min?

236
00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.076 line:80%
Mr. Park.

237
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.496 line:80%
What's going on? What are you doing here?

238
00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:25.957 line:80%
Well...

239
00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:31.045 line:80%
What is it?

240
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.381 line:80%
The thing is...

241
00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:35.717 line:80%
What's wrong?

242
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:52.358 line:80%
What?

243
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.569 line:80%
Something's wrong.

244
00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:01.367 line:80%
The passcode is the day
Ji-won and I started dating.

245
00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:02.827 line:80%
Zero, six, two, two.

246
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.287 line:80%
Am I wrong?

247
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.747 line:80%
June 22. It's right.

248
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.334 line:80%
I'll try calling her now.

249
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.629 line:80%
She won't pick up.

250
00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:17.967 line:80%
The person you are...

251
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.260 line:80%
This isn't like her.

252
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.472 line:80%
It's okay.

253
00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.016 line:80%
I'll keep waiting outside.

254
00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.853 line:80%
No. I came to see her too.

255
00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:29.979 line:80%
It's just that...

256
00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.482 line:80%
What do we do?

257
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.868 line:80%
Let's go get
something warm to drink and talk.

258
00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:45.745 line:80%
You can tell me what happened.

259
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.833 line:80%
Stop crying.

260
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.172 line:80%
Then shall we go outside?

261
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:57.256 line:80%
Okay.

262
00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.650 line:80%
Mr. Yu caught me acting strange.

263
00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:16.943 line:80%
How do I explain it?

264
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:26.160 line:80%
Thank you.

265
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.920 line:80%
It tastes good, and it's warm too.

266
00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:49.559 line:80%
Since Park Min-hwan and I
are an office couple,

267
00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.394 line:80%
I'm sure you're also curious.

268
00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:55.732 line:80%
However, it's my personal life.
So I don't want to explain.

269
00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:58.276 line:80%
Sure.

270
00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.822 line:80%
I'm curious,
but don't explain if you don't want to.

271
00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:07.785 line:80%
As long as you're making
a good decision for yourself,

272
00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:09.912 line:80%
that's enough for me.

273
00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:14.834 line:80%
I'm sure of that.

274
00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:17.628 line:80%
I figured something out lately.

275
00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:22.300 line:80%
I've been conforming to others
my whole life,

276
00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:24.135 line:80%
so I didn't know who I was.

277
00:22:26.054 --> 00:22:28.639 line:80%
So?
Did you learn something about yourself?

278
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:32.643 line:80%
I'm still learning.

279
00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:37.106 line:80%
I'm planning a meal kit proposal.

280
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.275 line:80%
Meal kit?

281
00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:41.360 line:80%
Yeah.

282
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:45.615 line:80%
Show me when you're done.

283
00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.575 line:80%
No, that's okay.

284
00:22:47.658 --> 00:22:50.453 line:80%
I'll look forward to it.
The sooner the better.

285
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.124 line:80%
If that's the case,

286
00:22:55.792 --> 00:22:56.834 line:80%
okay.

287
00:22:58.044 --> 00:22:59.712 line:80%
What else do you want to do?

288
00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:02.590 line:80%
Well, what else...

289
00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:05.343 line:80%
I want to do interior design.

290
00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:09.263 line:80%
Also, I want to learn self-defense.

291
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.975 line:80%
Self-defense? Shall I teach you that?

292
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.398 line:80%
Self-defense from you?

293
00:23:19.982 --> 00:23:21.442 line:80%
What was that reaction?

294
00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:23.236 line:80%
It's just...

295
00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:26.697 line:80%
I just didn't picture you as the type.

296
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.408 line:80%
What? I was an athlete.

297
00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:34.038 line:80%
I did judo, hapkido, special martial arts,
taekwondo, Muay Thai, kickboxing...

298
00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:41.462 line:80%
I mean...

299
00:23:45.341 --> 00:23:48.886 line:80%
I've had this thought for a while.

300
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:56.102 line:80%
Have you considered wearing contacts?

301
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:12.910 line:80%
DRIED YOUNG POLLACK
GRILLED DRIED POLLACK

302
00:24:15.288 --> 00:24:17.707 line:80%
Don't drink so fast. You'll get drunk.

303
00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:22.628 line:80%
I don't know how things got this bad.

304
00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:26.090 line:80%
I'm scared Ji-won will get the wrong idea.

305
00:24:26.174 --> 00:24:27.675 line:80%
Come on.

306
00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:30.178 line:80%
You know she's not the type to do that.

307
00:24:30.761 --> 00:24:32.430 line:80%
She's been acting strange.

308
00:24:34.015 --> 00:24:36.976 line:80%
It feels like
she's getting distant from me.

309
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:42.315 line:80%
Our relationship wasn't like that.

310
00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:45.359 line:80%
She's been strange indeed.

311
00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:49.697 line:80%
Wait, is something really going on
with Yu Ji-hyuk?

312
00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:51.449 line:80%
No way.

313
00:24:51.532 --> 00:24:53.284 line:80%
Ji-won likes me, and it means

314
00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:56.120 line:80%
she cares
about both looks and personality.

315
00:24:58.414 --> 00:25:00.750 line:80%
It's because she's been busy.

316
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:02.376 line:80%
She's one-track minded.

317
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.378 line:80%
She only thinks about one thing.

318
00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:07.423 line:80%
-Do you think so?
-Of course.

319
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:09.967 line:80%
Everyone knows what type of relationship

320
00:25:10.051 --> 00:25:11.302 line:80%
you have with Ji-won.

321
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:14.972 line:80%
Right?

322
00:25:15.723 --> 00:25:16.724 line:80%
Yeah.

323
00:25:20.603 --> 00:25:23.898 line:80%
I'm so glad I met you, Mr. Park.

324
00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:29.570 line:80%
If I hadn't,
I would've gone through such a hard time.

325
00:25:33.783 --> 00:25:35.076 line:80%
Thanks so much.

326
00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:39.372 line:80%
You're the best! You're the coolest!

327
00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:44.752 line:80%
Thanks.

328
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.380 line:80%
The coolest...

329
00:25:57.181 --> 00:25:58.182 line:80%
Eat this...

330
00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:19.787 line:80%
We're here.

331
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.335 line:80%
Thanks for the ride.

332
00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:29.213 line:80%
-I'll go inside.
-Shall I walk you to your door?

333
00:26:29.672 --> 00:26:30.756 line:80%
What?

334
00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:33.384 line:80%
Never mind.

335
00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:36.929 line:80%
Ms. Kang?

336
00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:42.351 line:80%
I think we need to meet

337
00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:45.604 line:80%
as many people as possible
before getting married.

338
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:52.820 line:80%
You're more free-spirited than I thought.

339
00:26:53.404 --> 00:26:54.655 line:80%
I wasn't, but now...

340
00:26:56.991 --> 00:26:58.409 line:80%
No, wait.

341
00:26:58.492 --> 00:26:59.910 line:80%
I won't be from now on.

342
00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:04.415 line:80%
Anyway, I don't think marriage is a must.

343
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:08.878 line:80%
So you don't want to get married.

344
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:11.505 line:80%
No. I'm going to get married.

345
00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:15.801 line:80%
What I wanted to say was...

346
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.471 line:80%
I mean...

347
00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:20.890 line:80%
Well...

348
00:27:25.394 --> 00:27:26.479 line:80%
I swear...

349
00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:33.736 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

350
00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:38.741 line:80%
It's nice to see you smile.

351
00:28:01.097 --> 00:28:04.058 line:80%
Interior design proposal
for my savior's happiness!

352
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:11.565 line:80%
She's so cute.

353
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:34.171 line:80%
In order to do all of this,
I recommend moving to somewhere new!

354
00:28:34.922 --> 00:28:36.006 line:80%
Moving...

355
00:28:38.843 --> 00:28:40.261 line:80%
That's a good idea.

356
00:28:55.276 --> 00:28:57.695 line:80%
OTHER HALF

357
00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:04.034 line:80%
OTHER HALF
MISSED CALL

358
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:10.833 line:80%
I can't reach you.

359
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:14.253 line:80%
I don't know why they acted that way
at the reunion.

360
00:29:15.254 --> 00:29:18.299 line:80%
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you about it.

361
00:29:18.382 --> 00:29:20.509 line:80%
I just wanted us to all get along.

362
00:29:23.012 --> 00:29:26.015 line:80%
I don't think this should be done
over text or call.

363
00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:28.267 line:80%
Let's talk tomorrow.

364
00:29:35.024 --> 00:29:36.901 line:80%
PARK MIN-HWAN

365
00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:46.619 line:80%
Ji-won.

366
00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:55.628 line:80%
Su-min's crying right now.

367
00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:58.631 line:80%
It sounds like a misunderstanding.
Where are you?

368
00:30:02.092 --> 00:30:04.303 line:80%
I'm glad you're with her.

369
00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:06.722 line:80%
Take care of her and get her home.

370
00:30:07.223 --> 00:30:09.767 line:80%
I have a lot on my mind,
so I need time to think.

371
00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:16.732 line:80%
-Are you okay?
-Are you?

372
00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:17.942 line:80%
Yeah, I'm okay.

373
00:30:21.237 --> 00:30:23.906 line:80%
Still, I don't think
I can do this for long.

374
00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:29.411 line:80%
So hurry up and get married. Please.

375
00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:54.812 line:80%
-Hello?
-
Hey.

376
00:30:55.938 --> 00:30:58.816 line:80%
I'm not the type to be clingy

377
00:30:58.899 --> 00:31:00.818 line:80%
but I couldn't help but call you.

378
00:31:01.402 --> 00:31:04.697 line:80%
Sorry, I got home late and couldn't call.

379
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.032 line:80%
No, that's okay. It's not late.

380
00:31:08.242 --> 00:31:11.745 line:80%
I was just feeling impatient.

381
00:31:14.123 --> 00:31:16.875 line:80%
But it feels weird talking to you
like this.

382
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.795 line:80%
You think so?

383
00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:22.673 line:80%
Have we never spoken on the phone before?

384
00:31:22.756 --> 00:31:25.426 line:80%
No, you told me not to speak...

385
00:31:28.262 --> 00:31:29.263 line:80%
Never mind.

386
00:31:29.847 --> 00:31:30.848 line:80%
What is it?

387
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:34.852 line:80%
No. Actually, no, no.

388
00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:36.270 line:80%
Don't say it.

389
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:41.191 line:80%
How many times will you say "no"?

390
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:43.402 line:80%
Okay.

391
00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:48.240 line:80%
In the past, you told me
not to speak to you again.

392
00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:49.742 line:80%
It was because of that.

393
00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:53.120 line:80%
Hey! Ji-won.

394
00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:13.474 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won!

395
00:32:16.852 --> 00:32:17.978 line:80%
What did I do?

396
00:32:20.689 --> 00:32:22.399 line:80%
You shouldn't be like that.

397
00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:28.280 line:80%
I never want to speak to you again.

398
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.878 line:80%
What's wrong with him?
I didn't say anything.

399
00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.215 line:80%
Sorry, Ji-won.

400
00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:50.928 line:80%
I told him that you had feelings for him.

401
00:32:55.099 --> 00:32:58.560 line:80%
Does it make him feel
that awful that I like him?

402
00:33:10.364 --> 00:33:14.493 line:80%
That's because you rejected me.

403
00:33:15.077 --> 00:33:17.329 line:80%
I rejected you?

404
00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:18.831 line:80%
Yeah.

405
00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:22.960 line:80%
I still have that letter.

406
00:33:25.462 --> 00:33:26.714 line:80%
-Letter?
-
Yeah.

407
00:33:26.797 --> 00:33:28.173 line:80%
Your reply.

408
00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:31.969 line:80%
I wanted to throw it away, but I couldn't.

409
00:33:32.553 --> 00:33:35.472 line:80%
So you asked me out through a letter,

410
00:33:35.556 --> 00:33:37.224 line:80%
and I replied?

411
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.144 line:80%
Did you forget?

412
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.606 line:80%
I worked hard to write that letter.

413
00:33:46.483 --> 00:33:47.818 line:80%
I stayed up all night.

414
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:50.904 line:80%
Oh, well.

415
00:33:52.072 --> 00:33:54.032 line:80%
-
Eun-ho.
-Yeah?

416
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:56.910 line:80%
Shall we meet up?

417
00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.496 line:80%
Can you bring

418
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.916 line:80%
my reply letter?

419
00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.432 line:80%
Where is she? She's usually early.

420
00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:41.997 line:80%
What's this, Ms. Kang?

421
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.665 line:80%
You look like a celebrity!

422
00:34:43.749 --> 00:34:45.083 line:80%
Is it a special day?

423
00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.127 line:80%
No, it's not like that.

424
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:49.755 line:80%
Wow, you look so pretty.

425
00:34:51.548 --> 00:34:54.593 line:80%
Actually, I went shopping
with Hui-yeon on Saturday.

426
00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:56.136 line:80%
So while I was at it...

427
00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.388 line:80%
Great job.

428
00:34:58.472 --> 00:35:00.057 line:80%
Right? You look amazing.

429
00:35:00.641 --> 00:35:02.976 line:80%
-Ji-won.
-What's going on? Move!

430
00:35:04.186 --> 00:35:05.270 line:80%
Babe.

431
00:35:06.146 --> 00:35:08.023 line:80%
Are you really my girlfriend?

432
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.566 line:80%
You look so different.

433
00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:12.486 line:80%
I wanted to surprise you.

434
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:14.404 line:80%
You did surprise me.

435
00:35:14.988 --> 00:35:16.198 line:80%
Babe.

436
00:35:18.075 --> 00:35:21.495 line:80%
You look like someone else
without your glasses. So pretty.

437
00:35:22.621 --> 00:35:26.208 line:80%
You talk as if you've never seen her
without her glasses.

438
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:27.584 line:80%
Come on.

439
00:35:27.668 --> 00:35:29.127 line:80%
Of course, I've seen it.

440
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:30.963 line:80%
She just looks so new.

441
00:35:31.046 --> 00:35:32.297 line:80%
So new!

442
00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:45.477 line:80%
What was that?

443
00:35:49.273 --> 00:35:50.649 line:80%
I'm sorry.

444
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.611 line:80%
I'm sorry.

445
00:35:58.407 --> 00:36:01.285 line:80%
I'll clean it up, Mr. Yu.

446
00:36:02.286 --> 00:36:03.453 line:80%
Thank you.

447
00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:06.290 line:80%
What? But...

448
00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:10.836 line:80%
Your outfit...

449
00:36:11.879 --> 00:36:14.089 line:80%
doesn't seem suitable for work today.

450
00:36:15.257 --> 00:36:16.550 line:80%
Excuse me?

451
00:36:16.633 --> 00:36:17.634 line:80%
I...

452
00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:19.928 line:80%
It's very suitable for work, so why

453
00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:22.806 line:80%
are you criticizing her?

454
00:36:25.976 --> 00:36:29.813 line:80%
I must've felt that way because
I haven't seen her without her glasses.

455
00:36:29.897 --> 00:36:30.731 line:80%
Excuse me.

456
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.441 line:80%
You saw it yesterday.

457
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:34.902 line:80%
What?

458
00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:42.492 line:80%
That was the weekend,
and it's the first time at work.

459
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.079 line:80%
What?

460
00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:50.250 line:80%
I see you're wearing contacts too.

461
00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:56.465 line:80%
She's right.

462
00:36:57.049 --> 00:36:58.258 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

463
00:36:58.842 --> 00:37:00.093 line:80%
You look much better.

464
00:37:04.765 --> 00:37:07.768 line:80%
That's why you look
somewhat different today.

465
00:37:07.851 --> 00:37:09.019 line:80%
You look much...

466
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.151 line:80%
I...

467
00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:20.656 line:80%
Did you get contacts together?

468
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:22.199 line:80%
What are you saying?

469
00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:23.659 line:80%
Why?

470
00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:24.743 line:80%
Go to your seat.

471
00:37:28.872 --> 00:37:29.873 line:80%
Goodness.

472
00:37:29.957 --> 00:37:31.291 line:80%
Stop it.

473
00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:35.587 line:80%
Mr. Park, good for you.

474
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:39.049 line:80%
We were just talking about Ms. Kang.

475
00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:43.428 line:80%
You have a really great eye.

476
00:37:43.512 --> 00:37:47.307 line:80%
Who knew Ms. Kang was that beautiful?

477
00:37:47.391 --> 00:37:50.352 line:80%
You probably didn't know
but she's always been pretty.

478
00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:55.941 line:80%
-You'll need a good defense.
-What?

479
00:37:56.024 --> 00:38:00.028 line:80%
Just because there's a goalkeeper
doesn't mean a goal can't be made.

480
00:38:00.362 --> 00:38:01.488 line:80%
There's Seo Jin-su.

481
00:38:01.571 --> 00:38:04.157 line:80%
He's been talking about Ms. Kang all day.

482
00:38:04.241 --> 00:38:05.659 line:80%
He's right.

483
00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:07.869 line:80%
Come on. No.

484
00:38:07.953 --> 00:38:09.830 line:80%
The ball wouldn't like that.

485
00:38:10.414 --> 00:38:12.082 line:80%
The ball is crazy about me...

486
00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:21.675 line:80%
Over here.

487
00:38:25.262 --> 00:38:26.263 line:80%
What's going on?

488
00:38:26.346 --> 00:38:28.223 line:80%
I have a meeting outside later.

489
00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:30.017 line:80%
It'll just take a second.

490
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.436 line:80%
Here. This coffee's for you. Drink it.

491
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:34.730 line:80%
Thanks.

492
00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:38.859 line:80%
Did you rest up?

493
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:41.903 line:80%
How do you feel?

494
00:38:42.529 --> 00:38:44.865 line:80%
Sorry about Friday.

495
00:38:46.158 --> 00:38:48.910 line:80%
Did you feel better after the reunion?

496
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:54.833 line:80%
And...

497
00:38:57.002 --> 00:38:58.128 line:80%
By the way,

498
00:38:59.755 --> 00:39:03.550 line:80%
how did you meet Yu Ji-hyuk yesterday?

499
00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:06.678 line:80%
Oh, that.

500
00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:12.059 line:80%
I feel bad for using Mr. Yu so much.

501
00:39:12.142 --> 00:39:14.811 line:80%
Something urgent came up
and he called me out.

502
00:39:14.895 --> 00:39:17.564 line:80%
I left my school reunion because of that.

503
00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:20.108 line:80%
What a jerk! How could he do that?

504
00:39:22.444 --> 00:39:24.321 line:80%
I think Yu Ji-hyuk

505
00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:26.990 line:80%
likes you.

506
00:39:31.286 --> 00:39:32.537 line:80%
No, it's not like that.

507
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:34.956 line:80%
Yes, it is. I know it as a man.

508
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.167 line:80%
It's like an antenna for males.

509
00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:40.420 line:80%
No matter how urgent,
why would he call you?

510
00:39:40.504 --> 00:39:44.800 line:80%
Just this morning, he went on
about your outfit being unsuitable.

511
00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:47.427 line:80%
You're so pretty

512
00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:49.971 line:80%
that it made him crazy.

513
00:39:50.847 --> 00:39:52.349 line:80%
What a jerk.

514
00:39:56.686 --> 00:39:57.687 line:80%
By the way,

515
00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:02.609 line:80%
you look really pretty today.

516
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:08.865 line:80%
You're so pretty, and it makes me angry
that other jerks are looking at you.

517
00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:10.951 line:80%
I should be the only one.

518
00:40:11.451 --> 00:40:12.577 line:80%
You're mine, right?

519
00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.166 line:80%
What's this?

520
00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:20.794 line:80%
Right here.

521
00:40:25.507 --> 00:40:27.551 line:80%
Oh, no! What do we do?

522
00:40:27.634 --> 00:40:29.761 line:80%
What do we do? Go to the restroom!

523
00:40:29.845 --> 00:40:31.721 line:80%
Hurry and go to the restroom!

524
00:40:31.805 --> 00:40:34.015 line:80%
It's seeping through my underwear!

525
00:40:35.725 --> 00:40:36.977 line:80%
Wait!

526
00:40:45.986 --> 00:40:47.154 line:80%
Ji-won.

527
00:40:53.368 --> 00:40:56.037 line:80%
You didn't take it the wrong way, did you?

528
00:40:58.582 --> 00:41:00.667 line:80%
I don't know why they said that.

529
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.170 line:80%
They're so immature. It was ten years ago.

530
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:11.636 line:80%
How could I not trust you?

531
00:41:12.762 --> 00:41:16.224 line:80%
If I hadn't seen the end,
it would've been impossible

532
00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.019 line:80%
for me to not trust you.

533
00:41:21.771 --> 00:41:23.648 line:80%
I could've made a mistake,

534
00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:26.401 line:80%
but you know I get confused easily.

535
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.243 line:80%
Yeah, I was mad yesterday,

536
00:41:35.327 --> 00:41:36.745 line:80%
but it did seem strange.

537
00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:39.664 line:80%
There was no reason for you to lie

538
00:41:39.748 --> 00:41:42.876 line:80%
about dating Eun-ho
and say I told you to dump him.

539
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:47.797 line:80%
Unless you wanted to make me
look like a bad person.

540
00:41:50.217 --> 00:41:51.676 line:80%
But...

541
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.845 line:80%
only a crazy person would do that.

542
00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:58.892 line:80%
That's right.
I wouldn't do something like that.

543
00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:06.399 line:80%
Ye-ji and her friends always picked on me
for the strangest things.

544
00:42:06.483 --> 00:42:07.609 line:80%
It must be you now.

545
00:42:08.568 --> 00:42:09.569 line:80%
Yeah.

546
00:42:09.653 --> 00:42:13.448 line:80%
I won't let it slide this time.
We're not in high school anymore.

547
00:42:15.158 --> 00:42:17.369 line:80%
I'm going to meet Eun-ho and ask him.

548
00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:20.830 line:80%
You're going to see him?

549
00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:24.292 line:80%
Yeah, he gave me his number.
He wants to meet up.

550
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:28.171 line:80%
Don't worry, my other half.

551
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.591 line:80%
This time,

552
00:42:31.675 --> 00:42:33.468 line:80%
I really won't let it slide.

553
00:42:36.346 --> 00:42:37.347 line:80%
Okay.

554
00:42:43.144 --> 00:42:45.772 line:80%
But don't you think
Min-hwan wouldn't like it

555
00:42:45.855 --> 00:42:47.274 line:80%
if you met another man?

556
00:42:48.233 --> 00:42:49.734 line:80%
Min-hwan isn't like that.

557
00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:54.739 line:80%
He wants me to feel at ease.

558
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.741 line:80%
Also,

559
00:42:57.909 --> 00:43:01.288 line:80%
his stocks went through the roof
and made a lot of money.

560
00:43:06.001 --> 00:43:09.129 line:80%
His stocks did that well?

561
00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:11.881 line:80%
He said to look forward
to our newlywed house.

562
00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:14.926 line:80%
Lucky you.

563
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:29.524 line:80%
We haven't left work on time in ages,
right, Ji-won?

564
00:43:35.196 --> 00:43:36.906 line:80%
Right, Ms. Kang?

565
00:43:41.036 --> 00:43:42.620 line:80%
To celebrate,

566
00:43:43.413 --> 00:43:45.081 line:80%
who wants to get chicken?

567
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.711 line:80%
I have to pick up my kid.

568
00:43:50.462 --> 00:43:51.796 line:80%
I'm meeting a client.

569
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.923 line:80%
-I can--
-Seriously?

570
00:43:54.007 --> 00:43:56.343 line:80%
You deserve an incentive, Ji-won.

571
00:43:56.426 --> 00:43:58.386 line:80%
You do all the work on your own.

572
00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:27.582 line:80%
Excuse me.

573
00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:32.003 line:80%
Sorry about that.

574
00:44:42.138 --> 00:44:43.807 line:80%
That hair looks good on you.

575
00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:47.185 line:80%
Everyone was talking about you today,

576
00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:49.896 line:80%
saying how they were all jealous
of Mr. Park.

577
00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:51.981 line:80%
Stop it.

578
00:44:52.065 --> 00:44:55.735 line:80%
Ms. Kang, you and Mr. Park
make a great couple.

579
00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:57.445 line:80%
I'm so jealous.

580
00:45:13.044 --> 00:45:14.045 line:80%
Ms. Kang.

581
00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:15.839 line:80%
Yes, Mr. Yu?

582
00:45:25.432 --> 00:45:28.351 line:80%
Why did you dress like that
for work today?

583
00:45:32.647 --> 00:45:35.650 line:80%
Do I look that strange today?

584
00:45:36.484 --> 00:45:37.944 line:80%
No, it's not that.

585
00:45:41.114 --> 00:45:43.700 line:80%
Never mind. I shouldn't have said that.

586
00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:50.748 line:80%
I wore my contacts today
after what you said.

587
00:45:58.673 --> 00:46:01.301 line:80%
So I was wondering
if you dressed like this

588
00:46:01.843 --> 00:46:03.803 line:80%
because of or for someone.

589
00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:06.389 line:80%
It makes me feel good.

590
00:46:08.808 --> 00:46:12.437 line:80%
I dressed up for the first time like this,
and it felt good.

591
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.400 line:80%
And people started treating me differently
because I dressed up like this.

592
00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:21.571 line:80%
Wouldn't it be wrong for others

593
00:46:21.654 --> 00:46:24.741 line:80%
to treat you differently
over how you're dressed?

594
00:46:25.617 --> 00:46:26.618 line:80%
You're right.

595
00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:30.121 line:80%
But there are people who do that.

596
00:46:31.748 --> 00:46:37.337 line:80%
I think this is the right way to deal
with those type of people.

597
00:46:38.087 --> 00:46:39.380 line:80%
From now on,

598
00:46:40.048 --> 00:46:43.510 line:80%
I won't just foolishly
stick to formalities anymore.

599
00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:45.261 line:80%
For my sake.

600
00:46:45.929 --> 00:46:48.139 line:80%
For your sake?

601
00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:50.600 line:80%
Yeah.

602
00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:59.317 line:80%
I swear,
you look different when you smile.

603
00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:02.278 line:80%
I hope you smile more often.

604
00:47:07.575 --> 00:47:08.785 line:80%
Also,

605
00:47:08.868 --> 00:47:11.371 line:80%
I'm not an expert on this either,

606
00:47:13.414 --> 00:47:16.417 line:80%
but I think it would be better
if you change

607
00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:18.461 line:80%
your style a little.

608
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:21.005 line:80%
I recommend that. Bye now.

609
00:47:26.553 --> 00:47:27.887 line:80%
Yeah.

610
00:47:27.971 --> 00:47:30.390 line:80%
Foolishly sticking to formalities is bad.

611
00:47:37.981 --> 00:47:39.357 line:80%
Hey, where are you?

612
00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:44.654 line:80%
We'll leave it to you, Ms. Kang.

613
00:47:44.737 --> 00:47:47.323 line:80%
You can take the bus
at the shopping street.

614
00:47:47.407 --> 00:47:49.409 line:80%
Okay, thank you for your time.

615
00:47:58.918 --> 00:48:01.754 line:80%
I wore my contacts today
after what you said.

616
00:48:01.838 --> 00:48:03.631 line:80%
I think Yu Ji-hyuk likes you.

617
00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:13.474 line:80%
Yes, it's mine!

618
00:48:13.558 --> 00:48:15.476 line:80%
It's mine!

619
00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.231 line:80%
Isn't that Hui-yeon?

620
00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:23.192 line:80%
Yeah!

621
00:48:23.276 --> 00:48:24.277 line:80%
What's she doing?

622
00:48:24.861 --> 00:48:26.070 line:80%
Hui-yeon...

623
00:48:26.154 --> 00:48:27.530 line:80%
What are you doing?

624
00:48:27.614 --> 00:48:29.490 line:80%
-What are you doing?
-I'm happy!

625
00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:32.410 line:80%
Yes, it's mine!

626
00:48:32.493 --> 00:48:35.204 line:80%
Okay, I get that you're happy,
but please stop.

627
00:48:37.457 --> 00:48:38.458 line:80%
Thank you!

628
00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:42.253 line:80%
I won't forget your kindness
of buying me this limited edition!

629
00:48:42.337 --> 00:48:45.506 line:80%
I would be thankful if you calmed down.

630
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.925 line:80%
-Come on!
-Wait!

631
00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:00.605 line:80%
Right. There was a scandal about them.

632
00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:02.899 line:80%
PERSONNEL TRANSFER STAFF YU HUI-YEON

633
00:49:09.322 --> 00:49:12.241 line:80%
Mr. Kim said
they had an inappropriate relationship

634
00:49:12.325 --> 00:49:13.951 line:80%
so she was even transferred.

635
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:16.621 line:80%
I can't believe this.

636
00:49:17.413 --> 00:49:21.501 line:80%
We kept bumping into each other
because I'm friends with Hui-yeon now.

637
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.254 line:80%
I had no idea.

638
00:49:26.255 --> 00:49:27.256 line:80%
Gosh.

639
00:49:28.383 --> 00:49:29.759 line:80%
That could've been bad.

640
00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:34.055 line:80%
Park Min-hwan, you useless jerk.

641
00:49:34.555 --> 00:49:36.182 line:80%
Male's antenna, my foot.

642
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:45.274 line:80%
Mr. Yu and Hui-yeon

643
00:49:47.193 --> 00:49:48.653 line:80%
were dating.

644
00:49:55.702 --> 00:49:59.914 line:80%
The successor of U&K
does get treated differently.

645
00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:02.083 line:80%
I always had to wait in line,

646
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.585 line:80%
but he went straight to the VVIP room.

647
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:08.047 line:80%
"What did you want?
Give her everything she wants."

648
00:50:08.131 --> 00:50:09.799 line:80%
That's what he said!

649
00:50:10.925 --> 00:50:14.554 line:80%
-Is that why you're happy?
-I haven't been this happy in ages!

650
00:50:14.887 --> 00:50:17.598 line:80%
And he acted like
he's not into luxurious brands.

651
00:50:17.682 --> 00:50:19.350 line:80%
It was so cool, Grandfather.

652
00:50:19.475 --> 00:50:21.394 line:80%
I always want to buy things.

653
00:50:21.477 --> 00:50:25.606 line:80%
I asked him to buy me
all the clothes, bags, and shoes I wanted.

654
00:50:25.982 --> 00:50:29.527 line:80%
Clothes, bags, shoes, coats...
Because it's his credit card.

655
00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:32.405 line:80%
He bought me everything.
That was pretty cool.

656
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:37.243 line:80%
I want to stay a little longer.
I'm sorry to leave so early.

657
00:50:37.869 --> 00:50:38.870 line:80%
That's okay.

658
00:50:42.582 --> 00:50:44.709 line:80%
-Hello, Mr. Lee.
-Hi.

659
00:50:44.876 --> 00:50:48.880 line:80%
Who's doing the strategic planning
if you're always with Grandfather?

660
00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:50.339 line:80%
He's my right-hand man.

661
00:50:50.423 --> 00:50:53.134 line:80%
No, that's me. I'm your right-hand person.

662
00:50:55.303 --> 00:50:57.847 line:80%
Take care of yourself. I'll visit soon.

663
00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:00.099 line:80%
Okay, come back whenever.

664
00:51:00.183 --> 00:51:01.476 line:80%
-You too.
-Okay.

665
00:51:02.852 --> 00:51:07.523 line:80%
-Ji-hyuk, you'll give me a ride, right?
-It's the opposite direction.

666
00:51:08.316 --> 00:51:10.401 line:80%
What are you saying? Take her home.

667
00:51:10.485 --> 00:51:12.737 line:80%
It's late. Will you make her go alone?

668
00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:14.781 line:80%
-Get in.
-Bye, Grandfather!

669
00:51:14.864 --> 00:51:15.698 line:80%
Bye.

670
00:51:19.952 --> 00:51:21.037 line:80%
Bye.

671
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:30.421 line:80%
Bye, Grandfather!

672
00:51:40.348 --> 00:51:42.016 line:80%
Did you look into the woman?

673
00:51:43.392 --> 00:51:45.311 line:80%
I left the report in your study.

674
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:54.028 line:80%
FRY ME

675
00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:05.248 line:80%
Ji-hyuk? Why?

676
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:08.376 line:80%
Hey, Ji-hyuk.

677
00:52:12.797 --> 00:52:13.881 line:80%
Right now?

678
00:52:52.795 --> 00:52:55.256 line:80%
If I want to teach a woman self-defense,

679
00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:57.091 line:80%
judo would be best, right?

680
00:52:58.968 --> 00:53:00.803 line:80%
Wait, all of this is because...

681
00:53:00.887 --> 00:53:04.181 line:80%
All of this so you can teach a woman
self-defense skills?

682
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:06.559 line:80%
Wait. That hurts so bad.

683
00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:09.520 line:80%
Great job.

684
00:53:12.982 --> 00:53:14.942 line:80%
He's so cold.

685
00:53:30.124 --> 00:53:34.337 line:80%
Whenever my dad gave me an allowance,
he always drew a heart on it.

686
00:53:55.149 --> 00:53:56.359 line:80%
Yeah, I know.

687
00:53:56.442 --> 00:53:58.444 line:80%
I didn't know it'd be this hard.

688
00:53:58.945 --> 00:54:01.906 line:80%
But I can't be honest
and it's complicating things.

689
00:54:04.951 --> 00:54:06.452 line:80%
What would you have done?

690
00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:11.874 line:80%
Shall I just tell Ji-won?

691
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:15.252 line:80%
That Min-hwan will cheat
on her with Su-min and hurt her.

692
00:54:20.049 --> 00:54:22.009 line:80%
No, if I say that,

693
00:54:22.093 --> 00:54:25.554 line:80%
I can't avoid telling her
that I'm living my second life.

694
00:54:31.811 --> 00:54:34.355 line:80%
She won't believe me.
Even I can't believe this.

695
00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:41.821 line:80%
I haven't figured everything out yet.

696
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.349 line:80%
APRIL 13, 2023

697
00:55:30.494 --> 00:55:34.999 line:80%
Mr. Park Min-hwan? You're under arrest
on suspicion of murdering Kang Ji-won.

698
00:55:36.959 --> 00:55:39.211 line:80%
Ms. Jeong Su-min? Please come with us.

699
00:55:39.712 --> 00:55:40.713 line:80%
What?

700
00:55:40.796 --> 00:55:42.339 line:80%
Damn it.

701
00:55:43.257 --> 00:55:44.633 line:80%
Stop right there!

702
00:55:46.427 --> 00:55:48.012 line:80%
What's going on?

703
00:55:48.095 --> 00:55:49.930 line:80%
Why are you doing this?

704
00:55:50.014 --> 00:55:52.058 line:80%
Why are you doing this? Let me go.

705
00:55:52.141 --> 00:55:53.934 line:80%
You have the right to remain silent.

706
00:55:54.018 --> 00:55:57.897 line:80%
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

707
00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:01.901 line:80%
-Do you understand your rights?
-Murder? What do you mean, murder?

708
00:56:01.984 --> 00:56:04.403 line:80%
I didn't kill anyone!

709
00:56:04.487 --> 00:56:08.282 line:80%
It was an accident!
It was culpable homicide!

710
00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:09.450 line:80%
Okay?

711
00:56:10.451 --> 00:56:12.870 line:80%
She was going to die anyway, right?

712
00:56:12.953 --> 00:56:14.497 line:80%
Those are the charges.

713
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.541 line:80%
Jeong Su-min will be arrested
as the accomplice.

714
00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:20.544 line:80%
Whatever you have to say,
save it for the station.

715
00:56:20.628 --> 00:56:21.837 line:80%
-What?
-Take them.

716
00:56:21.921 --> 00:56:23.297 line:80%
What? Why me?

717
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.549 line:80%
No, I didn't do it!

718
00:56:25.633 --> 00:56:26.884 line:80%
Take them quickly!

719
00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:30.471 line:80%
-It wasn't me! I didn't do it!
-Let go!

720
00:56:30.554 --> 00:56:31.555 line:80%
Let go!

721
00:56:42.733 --> 00:56:44.151 line:80%
What's going on?

722
00:56:44.777 --> 00:56:49.240 line:80%
So Jeong Su-min was
having an affair with Ji-won's husband?

723
00:56:49.782 --> 00:56:51.200 line:80%
This is unbelievable.

724
00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:53.786 line:80%
If that's true,
where did she get the nerve

725
00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:55.830 line:80%
to suddenly ask us to come here?

726
00:56:55.913 --> 00:56:59.583 line:80%
Honestly, I came because I felt bad.
Was it ten years ago?

727
00:56:59.667 --> 00:57:01.627 line:80%
We had a reunion at Goseuljung.

728
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:04.630 line:80%
We ganged up on her,
and I felt bad about it.

729
00:57:05.714 --> 00:57:10.970 line:80%
You're right. Do you really think
Ji-won told Eun-ho to dump Su-min?

730
00:57:12.138 --> 00:57:14.014 line:80%
-I don't know.
-Ji-won...

731
00:57:14.723 --> 00:57:15.850 line:80%
said what?

732
00:57:16.559 --> 00:57:18.561 line:80%
Eun-ho? What are you doing here?

733
00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:21.856 line:80%
Hey, come here!
It was so chaotic just now!

734
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:28.946 line:80%
What did you just say?

735
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:31.574 line:80%
Don't get me started.
Your ex, Jeong Su-min,

736
00:57:31.907 --> 00:57:34.743 line:80%
-conspired with Ji-won's husband--
-Wait.

737
00:57:34.827 --> 00:57:37.037 line:80%
I never dated Su-min.

738
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:38.873 line:80%
Is that true?

739
00:57:38.956 --> 00:57:40.791 line:80%
You never dated her?

740
00:57:40.875 --> 00:57:42.251 line:80%
Is that so?

741
00:57:45.129 --> 00:57:49.383 line:80%
There wasn't much to say about
what I heard regarding Kang Ji-won's life.

742
00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:51.886 line:80%
After that,

743
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.972 line:80%
I regretted everything like crazy.

744
00:57:57.433 --> 00:57:58.475 line:80%
But then...

745
00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:43.229 line:80%
I was given a second chance.

746
00:58:44.396 --> 00:58:47.983 line:80%
APRIL 19, 2013

747
00:59:05.834 --> 00:59:08.212 line:80%
Thinking back, I had a few chances.

748
00:59:08.796 --> 00:59:10.506 line:80%
But it's different this time.

749
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:11.632 line:80%
I do feel better.

750
00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:13.717 line:80%
Ji-won, let me tell you about men.

751
00:59:13.801 --> 00:59:15.261 line:80%
All men cheat.

752
00:59:15.344 --> 00:59:18.472 line:80%
Min-hwan,
you should control Ji-won better.

753
00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:20.015 line:80%
When something's changed,

754
00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:23.185 line:80%
what wasn't a problem in the past
could become one.

755
00:59:23.269 --> 00:59:26.188 line:80%
Where'd you go after work?
Tell me the truth.

756
00:59:26.272 --> 00:59:29.316 line:80%
I'm worried Mr. Park might hurt you.

757
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.818 line:80%
Are you crazy--

758
00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:31.735 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

759
00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:38.325 line:80%
