Here's an iris scanner.

Why?

They could've killed Tiger.

You know why they didn't?

739
01:06:21.209 --> 01:06:23.875 line:82%
Because treachery is worse than death
for an agent, Zoya.

740
01:06:26.042 --> 01:06:28.875 line:82%
The only reason you're still alive is
because you're Nazar saab's daughter.

Don't forget that.

You have no idea what's
in this briefcase, right?

758
01:07:37.459 --> 01:07:39.667 line:82%
Remember the nuclear triad

760
01:07:42.917 --> 01:07:44.750 line:82%
It has the Permissive

You and Tiger stole them together.

764
01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:54.084 line:82%
Pakistan will believe you stole them
for India.

765

Nothing you can do now, Zoya.

766
01:07:57.792 --> 01:08:00.125 line:82%
Neither India nor Pakistan
will ever trust you again.

767

Your choice is simple.

768
01:08:03.334 --> 01:08:06.709 line:82%
Would you prefer R&AW to kill you,
or the ISI?

769
01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:11.250 line:82%
Zoya, by stealing the PAL codes,

770
01:08:11.875 --> 01:08:14.792 line:82%
you have given India and Pakistan
the face of a new enemy.

Rakesh-ji, unlock the signal jammers.

Javed.

Aatish does not know
you're following him.

1430
02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.459 line:82%
Keep sending us his real-time location.

1431
02:05:05.167 --> 02:05:07.542 line:82%
He'll pass through the stables
to get to the bunker.

1432
02:05:07.834 --> 02:05:11.334 line:82%
You, Zoya and I will ambush him here.

1433
02:05:11.625 --> 02:05:13.709 line:82%
Sixty seconds is all we need.

1434
02:05:14.209 --> 02:05:17.834 line:82%
Then it makes no difference
what Aatish does or doesn't do.

1435
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.459 line:82%
By then, PM ma'am, you would've told
all Pakistan the truth.

[militant 3] Put your guns down!

1448
02:07:34.542 --> 02:07:36.709 line:82%
You used the whole Pakistan army…

1449
02:07:38.292 --> 02:07:40.042 line:82%
but we used only one of your men.

1450
02:07:42.209 --> 02:07:43.209 line:82%
Javed.

1451
02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:44.875 line:82%
Your cell phones.

1452
02:07:45.667 --> 02:07:47.250 line:82%
[Zoya]
We checked all the phones,

1453
02:07:47.334 --> 02:07:50.709 line:82%
and discovered Javed used to call
Rawalpindi every day.

1454

-[phone ringing]
-Hello.

1455

Same number. Javed's mother.
-Yes?

1456
02:07:55.459 --> 02:08:01.209 line:82%
[Tiger]
They have-- They had
a daughter too. Javed's sister. Shaheen.

1457
02:08:02.834 --> 02:08:04.500 line:82%
Your wife…

1458
02:08:05.125 --> 02:08:10.000 line:82%
who sacrificed her life
and unborn child for you.

1459
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:15.084 line:82%
Before you got into the PMO,

1460
02:08:15.625 --> 02:08:18.709 line:82%
we were sure Javed would bring you to us.

1461
02:08:18.792 --> 02:08:21.417 line:82%
Once we enter the PMO,
I'll watch Javed.

1462
02:08:21.667 --> 02:08:22.584 line:82%
[in English] I'll mark him.

1463

"A lot of healing!"

1464
02:08:30.209 --> 02:08:31.625 line:82%
Isn't that what you said?

1465
02:08:31.959 --> 02:08:33.500 line:82%
[Javed] There's more healing
to come, Tiger!

1466
02:08:35.084 --> 02:08:37.042 line:82%
And revenge for my sister Shaheen.

1467
02:09:00.542 --> 02:09:02.750 line:82%
[Aatish] Men must do men's work, Tiger.

1468
02:09:03.459 --> 02:09:04.750 line:82%
You shouldn't leave it to kids.

1469
02:09:10.375 --> 02:09:11.917 line:82%
Enjoy your family time!

1470
02:09:12.417 --> 02:09:14.417 line:82%
I'll go meet Irani sahiba

1471
02:09:15.125 --> 02:09:17.167 line:82%
and persuade her not to surrender.

1472
02:09:17.667 --> 02:09:19.000 line:82%
Better to die a martyr.

1473
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:24.417 line:82%
Sorry, Tiger.

1474
02:09:27.625 --> 02:09:29.292 line:82%
It's just like the
first time we met,

1475
02:09:30.917 --> 02:09:31.917 line:82%
in Ikrit.

1476
02:09:33.334 --> 02:09:34.709 line:82%
Same situation.

1477
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.834 line:82%
I owe my life to you.

1478
02:09:38.875 --> 02:09:39.792 line:82%
Today,

1479
02:09:41.250 --> 02:09:43.000 line:82%
I'm returning it to you.

Hassan!

1484

I wanted to invite you and Zoya
to hear my PM speech.

1485
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:57.709 line:82%
Find Zoya.

1486
02:11:00.167 --> 02:11:01.125 line:82%
Shall we go to the bunker?

1487
02:12:06.167 --> 02:12:08.417 line:82%
Zoya can't make it to hear
your speech.

1488
02:12:09.625 --> 02:12:11.959 line:82%
She's busy getting Irani sahiba's
speech ready.

[Zoya]
Hassan!

[Tiger] Hassan!

1491
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.250 line:82%
There's not much time, Zoya.
Take the PM to her chamber.

1492
02:12:22.334 --> 02:12:24.375 line:82%
You can't stop Aatish alone.

1493
02:12:24.459 --> 02:12:27.917 line:82%
No need for me to stop him. He must
be brought to the bunker. Go!

1494
02:12:28.542 --> 02:12:31.125 line:82%
Zoya has taken the PM
out of the bunker.

1495
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:37.042 line:82%
There was a reason we gave you
those bunker codes.

1496
02:12:37.167 --> 02:12:39.917 line:82%
-The entry code.
-280…

1497

You did everything right,

1498
02:12:42.042 --> 02:12:43.584 line:82%
but forgot one thing.

1499
02:12:44.542 --> 02:12:46.417 line:82%
Till the day Tiger breathes.

1500
02:12:48.042 --> 02:12:50.209 line:82%
Never will Tiger accept defeat.

[PM Irani]
My compatriots,

1508
02:14:59.667 --> 02:15:01.500 line:82%
your PM is still alive.

1509
02:15:02.167 --> 02:15:04.834 line:82%
But you must wait to celebrate
Independence Day…

1510
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:08.625 line:82%
because the PM's enclave
is under siege.

1511
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:12.084 line:82%
Pakistan's freedom is under siege.

1512
02:15:12.459 --> 02:15:15.875 line:82%
The terrorist is not an Indian.
He's a Pakistani.

1513
02:15:16.167 --> 02:15:19.334 line:82%
Pakistan's freedom is being threatened
by a Pakistani.

1514
02:15:19.667 --> 02:15:20.625 line:82%
Freedom!

1515
02:15:21.417 --> 02:15:24.334 line:82%
It's just a small word,
but it means a lot.

1516
02:15:24.417 --> 02:15:25.459 line:82%
[man 1] The PM is live.

1517
02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:29.417 line:82%
Freedom, democracy.

1518
02:15:30.167 --> 02:15:32.209 line:82%
You cannot put a price on them.

1519
02:15:33.334 --> 02:15:35.459 line:82%
But a price has been paid today

1520
02:15:36.167 --> 02:15:38.375 line:82%
for your freedom and mine.

1521
02:15:39.042 --> 02:15:41.250 line:82%
For Pakistan's democracy.

and other brave hearts who are
not even Pakistanis have died.

1525
02:15:52.875 --> 02:15:55.209 line:82%
The man we assumed
to be a terrorist,

1526
02:15:55.584 --> 02:15:58.667 line:82%
was the man who stopped the threat
of dictatorship.

1527
02:15:59.167 --> 02:16:00.834 line:82%
In his greed for power,

1528
02:16:01.459 --> 02:16:04.500 line:82%
Aatish Rehman,
with General Haq's support,

1529
02:16:04.584 --> 02:16:09.459 line:82%
wanted to declare martial law in Pakistan
and so entered the PMO.

1530
02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:14.625 line:82%
Between their plans
and Pakistan's democracy

1531
02:16:15.625 --> 02:16:17.417 line:82%
stood an Indian…

1532

it is thanks to Tiger.

If democracy is alive in Pakistan,

1537
02:16:34.625 --> 02:16:37.459 line:82%
it's because of Tiger and his team.

02:26:10.542 --> 02:26:12.584 line:82%
What I'm about to ask you, Kabir,

1636
02:26:14.667 --> 02:26:17.792 line:82%
no officer has the right
to ask of any soldier.

1637
02:26:19.209 --> 02:26:21.834 line:82%
Nor should a father ask of his son.

1638
02:26:22.709 --> 02:26:23.750 line:82%
But this job

1639
02:26:25.375 --> 02:26:27.250 line:82%
only you can do, Kabir.

1640
02:26:30.917 --> 02:26:32.542 line:82%
India has a new enemy.

1641
02:26:33.459 --> 02:26:36.250 line:82%
This enemy is dangerous and evil.

1642
02:26:37.667 --> 02:26:39.084 line:82%
An evil beyond your nightmares.

1643
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:52.084 line:82%
He has no name.

1644
02:26:52.959 --> 02:26:53.959 line:82%
Nor face.

1645
02:26:55.334 --> 02:26:56.792 line:82%
He thrives in darkness.

1646
02:26:59.459 --> 02:27:02.750 line:82%
And to stop him you'll have to enter
that darkness.

1647
02:27:03.875 --> 02:27:07.084 line:82%
You'll have to cross every line
between right and wrong.

1648
02:27:07.834 --> 02:27:11.709 line:82%
You'll have to erase your feelings
of good and bad.

1649
02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.125 line:82%
You'll have to do things, Kabir,

1650
02:27:14.209 --> 02:27:17.625 line:82%
that you won't forgive yourself
for having done.

1651
02:27:22.584 --> 02:27:23.959 line:82%
And if you survive,

1652
02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.292 line:82%
you'll face a threat greater than death.

1653
02:27:32.834 --> 02:27:34.459 line:82%
Because it's possible,

1654
02:27:36.125 --> 02:27:38.209 line:82%
when fighting a monster,

1655
02:27:40.167 --> 02:27:41.834 line:82%
you become a monster yourself.
