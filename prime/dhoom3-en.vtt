CHICAGO 1990.

2
00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:44.750 line:82%
That's it?

3
00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:05.208 line:82%
1st December 1990.

4
00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:12.583 line:82%
This was perhaps the most important
and dangerous day of our lives.

5
00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:19.208 line:82%
Like a boat in a storm...

6
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.292 line:82%
...we were neither sinking...

7
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.458 line:82%
...nor reaching the shore.

8
00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:28.292 line:82%
Today we shall look the storm
in the eye.

9
00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:30.667 line:82%
Will the storm quell...

10
00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:33.458 line:82%
...or swallow us?

11
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.208 line:82%
What you got?

12
00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:38.417 line:82%
Give it here.

13
00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.000 line:82%
Trying to get away, kid?

14
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.583 line:82%
Every storm and danger to us...

15
00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:47.625 line:82%
...was a challenge.

16
00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:48.958 line:82%
What else you got?

17
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.750 line:82%
Time to amaze the world.

18
00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.542 line:82%
Show them an impossible feat.

19
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.125 line:82%
Get him. Come on!

20
00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:03.375 line:82%
Stop! You're mine.

21
00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.125 line:82%
Don't let him go.

22
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.417 line:82%
He's getting away.

23
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.542 line:82%
THE GREAT INDIAN CIRCUS.

24
00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:55.333 line:82%
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

25
00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.458 line:82%
Sorry, sorry...

26
00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:20.792 line:82%
What's that?

27
00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:21.917 line:82%
Magic!

28
00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:31.583 line:82%
25$, Papa.

29
00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:34.625 line:82%
I know the bank loan is lots more.

30
00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.917 line:82%
Give them this.
It will help a little.

31
00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:50.958 line:82%
If I gave them your 25$...

32
00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.625 line:82%
...they'd be in our debt, son.

33
00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.917 line:82%
It's way too much.

34
00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:01.000 line:82%
As long as you have these 25$...

35
00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.667 line:82%
...no bank in the world can
shut our circus down.

36
00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.083 line:82%
But Papa...

37
00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:13.792 line:82%
...I heard you say the bank
won't listen to you.

38
00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:15.833 line:82%
But they have.

39
00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:20.542 line:82%
I said I'd put on a special show
for them.

40
00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:24.000 line:82%
"Don't shut us down if you like
the show."

41
00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:25.833 line:82%
What if they don't like it?

42
00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:27.875 line:82%
How is that possible?

43
00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.583 line:82%
They'll have to like it.

44
00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:33.500 line:82%
They'll have to.

45
00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:37.500 line:82%
It'll go brilliantly today.

46
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.625 line:82%
Because I have a great magician
performing in my act.

47
00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:47.417 line:82%
- And who is he?
- I know.

48
00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:50.708 line:82%
Me...Sahir.

49
00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:53.833 line:82%
My name means magician.

50
00:05:56.417 --> 00:06:00.250 line:82%
Dazzle the bankers with
your magic, son.

51
00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:03.000 line:82%
You bankers...

52
00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:09.083 line:82%
WESTERN.

53
00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:20.083 line:82%
THE GREAT INDIAN CIRCUS.

54
00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:59.167 line:82%
People of God are we.
Who can defy us?

55
00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:06.000 line:82%
Basking under a thousand suns
of hope.

56
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.917 line:82%
With steely resolve.

57
00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:12.250 line:82%
With fearless step.

58
00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:14.875 line:82%
Today we set forth...

59
00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:17.292 line:82%
...to write our destiny.

60
00:07:54.292 --> 00:07:55.500 line:82%
Gentlemen.

61
00:07:56.083 --> 00:08:00.000 line:82%
The Great Indian Circus.

62
00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:48.292 line:82%
And now, gentlemen.

63
00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:51.375 line:82%
My new act.

64
00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:55.958 line:82%
An act that has never been
seen before.

65
00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:30.583 line:82%
Papa...

66
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.542 line:82%
The boy...

67
00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:40.125 line:82%
...in the box.

68
00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:43.333 line:82%
What do you think, Mr. Anderson?

69
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.292 line:82%
You have 5 days to
hand over this place...

70
00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:01.167 line:82%
...and everything in it
we can auction.

71
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.833 line:82%
I just showed you the best act
ever seen in a circus.

72
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.583 line:82%
This is not a circus.

73
00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:19.417 line:82%
Circus is a woman in a short skirt
putting her head in a hippo's mouth.

74
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.583 line:82%
Circus is stupid.

75
00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:23.458 line:82%
That's what people pay money for.

76
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.833 line:82%
This is the future of circus,
Anderson.

77
00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:29.333 line:82%
We are bankers, Mr. Iqbal.

78
00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:32.000 line:82%
We understand the world of money.

79
00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:35.542 line:82%
You have defaulted on your payments.
You owe us.

80
00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:39.000 line:82%
This circus has not been running.

81
00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:40.833 line:82%
And it never will.

82
00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.083 line:82%
Please...

83
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.375 line:82%
My decision is final.

84
00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:07.167 line:82%
Sir, one minute, sir.

85
00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:09.750 line:82%
Sir, please sir, don't shut us.

86
00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:12.000 line:82%
My Papa is very good.
He's the best.

87
00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:17.250 line:82%
Ours will be the best circus
in the world, sir.

88
00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:19.875 line:82%
The greatest show on earth.

89
00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:21.667 line:82%
Sir...

90
00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:25.250 line:82%
Sir...

91
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.083 line:82%
Sir, we'll rouse the sleeping.
Look!

92
00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:35.208 line:82%
Make the sad laugh.

93
00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:40.667 line:82%
We'll show the world
feats never seen before.

94
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.583 line:82%
No one can match us, sir.

95
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.667 line:82%
Sir...

96
00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:55.375 line:82%
Please...

97
00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.542 line:82%
Please, please.

98
00:12:58.958 --> 00:12:59.875 line:82%
I beg you.

99
00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:01.333 line:82%
Give us one chance.

100
00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:02.542 line:82%
Sahir!

101
00:13:04.708 --> 00:13:05.625 line:82%
No.

102
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.250 line:82%
You must never beg.

103
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.542 line:82%
Preserving our honour...

104
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.292 line:82%
...is in our hands, always.

105
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.375 line:82%
This circus is my life.
You're tearing it from me.

106
00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:24.208 line:82%
Tearing it from me.

107
00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:35.958 line:82%
Don't try and threaten me.

108
00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:49.125 line:82%
You bankers...

109
00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:55.917 line:82%
May you rot in hell!

110
00:13:56.583 --> 00:13:57.917 line:82%
Papa...

111
00:14:43.042 --> 00:14:48.000 line:82%
People of God are we.
Who can defy us?

112
00:14:50.917 --> 00:14:55.167 line:82%
Basking under a thousand suns
of hope.

113
00:14:57.167 --> 00:14:59.000 line:82%
With steely resolve.

114
00:14:59.708 --> 00:15:01.667 line:82%
With fearless step.

115
00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.708 line:82%
Today we set forth...

116
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.625 line:82%
...to write our destiny.

117
00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:30.833 line:82%
WESTERN BANK OF CHICAGO.

118
00:15:32.417 --> 00:15:34.750 line:82%
Help. I'm homeless.

119
00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.833 line:82%
Won't somebody please help?

120
00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:56.708 line:82%
The suspect is trapped in the garage.

121
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.667 line:82%
I want a perimeter around
this building.

122
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000 line:82%
He's in the basement.
He can't run anywhere.

123
00:21:01.292 --> 00:21:02.208 line:82%
We've got him.

124
00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:38.583 line:82%
Captain, you're never
going to believe this one.

125
00:21:38.917 --> 00:21:40.625 line:82%
He went in there,
came out somewhere else.

126
00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:42.375 line:82%
How does he do it?

127
00:22:02.292 --> 00:22:05.875 line:82%
We have lost visual on the suspect.

128
00:22:06.083 --> 00:22:08.750 line:82%
I repeat we have lost visual contact.

129
00:22:10.875 --> 00:22:15.042 line:82%
YASH RAJ FILMS
PRESENTS.

130
00:25:12.792 --> 00:25:17.250 line:82%
DHOOM 3.

131
00:25:33.208 --> 00:25:34.667 line:82%
Where is Jai?

132
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.542 line:82%
Means?

133
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.792 line:82%
Is Jai showing up?

134
00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:40.083 line:82%
He's not taking my calls.

135
00:25:48.208 --> 00:25:50.750 line:82%
Non-stick pans. Pressure cookers
on sale.

136
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.833 line:82%
Buy them for your missus?
Damn good deal, boss.

137
00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:06.667 line:82%
You'll shoot me?

138
00:26:07.167 --> 00:26:07.625 line:82%
Yes.

139
00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:12.458 line:82%
Look at my face. Take your time.

140
00:26:13.292 --> 00:26:14.417 line:82%
Short version?

141
00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:16.708 line:82%
Star material, no?

142
00:26:18.042 --> 00:26:21.417 line:82%
With a great face like mine,
I end up in the police force.

143
00:26:21.833 --> 00:26:24.292 line:82%
And you'll blow me away?
For free?

144
00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:26.917 line:82%
Your hands will tremble.

145
00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:30.458 line:82%
Your gun will see me and say:
"Wow! Handsome guy.

146
00:26:30.792 --> 00:26:31.917 line:82%
"Let him go."

147
00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:34.958 line:82%
Forget what I say.
Listen to your gun, brother.

148
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:38.375 line:82%
So you figured you'd just
stroll in here...

149
00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:40.458 line:82%
...and arrest me?

150
00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:44.583 line:82%
And I'd go with you to jail,
all meek?

151
00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:48.458 line:82%
Why think that?

152
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.292 line:82%
- Truth?
- Please.

153
00:26:55.708 --> 00:27:00.667 line:82%
On 15 August, Independence Day,
we all take an oath.

154
00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:02.708 line:82%
That India is free.

155
00:27:03.417 --> 00:27:07.417 line:82%
And all Indians are equal.
I take the oath, too.

156
00:27:08.167 --> 00:27:10.000 line:82%
But I've got this nagging doubt.

157
00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:11.625 line:82%
Everyone equal? Means what?

158
00:27:11.917 --> 00:27:13.375 line:82%
You and me? Equal?

159
00:27:13.792 --> 00:27:16.375 line:82%
Aunty next door and the star
Hema Malini, equal?

160
00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:21.083 line:82%
No, boss.

161
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000 line:82%
Something fishy.

162
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.833 line:82%
Hot air!

163
00:27:26.542 --> 00:27:27.292 line:82%
You stand here...

164
00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:28.625 line:82%
...in your shiny suit.

165
00:27:28.917 --> 00:27:33.042 line:82%
While poor Raju there can't even
afford plastic rain cover.

166
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.750 line:82%
How come? Sure, India is free.

167
00:27:39.292 --> 00:27:40.875 line:82%
But people like you enslave her.

168
00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:42.792 line:82%
Made two Indias.

169
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.000 line:82%
One for us punters.

170
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.667 line:82%
One for you big shots.

171
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000 line:82%
Whose horse wins?

172
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.833 line:82%
Who wins the match?
Who wins the elections?

173
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.833 line:82%
The answers are in your pocket.

174
00:27:53.083 --> 00:27:54.333 line:82%
I want that pocket.

175
00:27:54.708 --> 00:27:56.792 line:82%
And the scum that live in it.

176
00:27:57.083 --> 00:27:58.708 line:82%
I'll wring their necks.

177
00:27:59.042 --> 00:28:01.875 line:82%
The day your sort is rotting
in jail...

178
00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:04.083 line:82%
...that day India will be truly free.

179
00:28:11.417 --> 00:28:13.292 line:82%
All your noble thoughts?

180
00:28:15.042 --> 00:28:17.375 line:82%
Actually, all Jai's ideas.

181
00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:20.208 line:82%
Gave you the short version.
You see...

182
00:28:21.708 --> 00:28:25.542 line:82%
I arrest guys. But Jai's fists
do the talking.

183
00:28:26.375 --> 00:28:28.375 line:82%
Makes pulp out of guys.

184
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:30.542 line:82%
Tried aunty's chutney?

185
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000 line:82%
That smooth.

186
00:28:32.292 --> 00:28:35.000 line:82%
So he'll come with an army
to save your face?

187
00:28:35.208 --> 00:28:38.750 line:82%
An army? One Jai is all I need.

188
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.625 line:82%
But no one makes an entry
quite like him.

189
00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:47.125 line:82%
And that brain of his?
No one can match him.

190
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.625 line:82%
You're not going to believe...

191
00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:53.583 line:82%
...what he'll do to you.

192
00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:08.375 line:82%
Solid entry, brother.

193
00:29:17.042 --> 00:29:18.042 line:82%
What the hell?

194
00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:33.750 line:82%
Rot in jail!

195
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.500 line:82%
Ali!

196
00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:24.167 line:82%
Hey! They keep coming.

197
00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:29.250 line:82%
Grind those brakes!

198
00:31:29.833 --> 00:31:33.000 line:82%
- They aren't working
- Mummy, help!

199
00:31:51.792 --> 00:31:52.917 line:82%
- Ali.
- Yes.

200
00:31:54.042 --> 00:31:55.083 line:82%
Run!

201
00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:54.042 line:82%
Excuse me, ma'am.

202
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.167 line:82%
Ma'am, what can you tell us
about the robbery?

203
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.333 line:82%
A bank robbery in this
day and age?

204
00:35:14.917 --> 00:35:16.042 line:82%
Mr. Anderson.

205
00:35:19.625 --> 00:35:21.208 line:82%
Who's this guy robbing us?

206
00:35:21.458 --> 00:35:24.542 line:82%
It's a thief, sir.
That's all I can say now.

207
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.583 line:82%
I mean this.

208
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:29.000 line:82%
"Bankers! May you rot in hell!"

209
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.625 line:82%
This is the second robbery at one
of our branches in a year.

210
00:35:33.083 --> 00:35:35.333 line:82%
First the Wacker Street branch
and now this.

211
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.292 line:82%
He takes the money and what he can't
take he destroys.

212
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.958 line:82%
My bank is going down
and I don't like it.

213
00:35:46.292 --> 00:35:47.792 line:82%
THE GREAT INDIAN CIRCUS.

214
00:35:57.792 --> 00:35:58.333 line:82%
25$.

215
00:35:59.042 --> 00:36:01.375 line:82%
I know the bank loan is lots more.

216
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.333 line:82%
As long as you have these 25$...

217
00:36:03.833 --> 00:36:06.250 line:82%
...no bank in the world can
shut our circus down.

218
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.333 line:82%
This circus has not been running
and it never will.

219
00:36:09.875 --> 00:36:12.042 line:82%
Ours will be the best circus
in the world.

220
00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:14.375 line:82%
- The greatest show on earth.
- This is not a circus.

221
00:36:14.708 --> 00:36:17.333 line:82%
This the future of circus, Anderson.

222
00:36:17.917 --> 00:36:22.125 line:82%
This circus is my life.
You're tearing it away from me.

223
00:36:38.833 --> 00:36:40.292 line:82%
My Papa is very good.

224
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.542 line:82%
He's the best.

225
00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:30.708 line:82%
THE GREAT INDIAN CIRCUS.

226
00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:40.417 line:82%
I've come home, Papa.

227
00:37:43.042 --> 00:37:44.500 line:82%
I've come home.

228
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.542 line:82%
Ali, this is a new city.
Let's see a new you.

229
00:38:21.958 --> 00:38:26.083 line:82%
Eyes to yourself. No girl here
is going to fall for you.

230
00:38:26.458 --> 00:38:29.000 line:82%
Ali is an international cop now.

231
00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:32.792 line:82%
Means...Ali's eyes are glued tight
on thieves.

232
00:38:33.292 --> 00:38:36.125 line:82%
And Ali's ears...

233
00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:37.875 line:82%
What?

234
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.833 line:82%
I can tell. A four-cylinder.

235
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:47.750 line:82%
Fabulous compression! It's a BMW.

236
00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:34.458 line:82%
I am officer Victoria Williams.

237
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.833 line:82%
Chicago Police Department,
Intelligence Wing.

238
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:40.333 line:82%
We've met before. London?
Crime conference last year?

239
00:39:41.042 --> 00:39:42.750 line:82%
Ah yes, sorry.

240
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.375 line:82%
I know I shouldn't forget
somebody like you but...

241
00:39:45.708 --> 00:39:47.042 line:82%
...I'm not a conference kind of guy.

242
00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.250 line:82%
Conferences make me go batty as well.

243
00:39:49.583 --> 00:39:51.958 line:82%
I mean who wants to talk about
criminals all day. It's boring.

244
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.000 line:82%
The food is always...

245
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.292 line:82%
Horrible!

246
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.708 line:82%
- I am glad you came.
- Me, too.

247
00:39:59.042 --> 00:40:01.042 line:82%
Coming here. Catching the thief.

248
00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:03.667 line:82%
Officer Ali Akbar. Mumbai Police.

249
00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:10.625 line:82%
Not crazy about conferences.
Only non-veg food for me.

250
00:40:12.167 --> 00:40:15.000 line:82%
Unfortunately that's my colleague.

251
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:17.708 line:82%
She doesn't speak Hindi.

252
00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:22.583 line:82%
Hindi? That's all the English
words I know.

253
00:40:23.125 --> 00:40:25.250 line:82%
I speak a little Hindi.
I have Indian friends so...

254
00:40:25.583 --> 00:40:28.667 line:82%
Wow! So where's our shack?

255
00:40:29.083 --> 00:40:32.208 line:82%
How do we get there? Bet three
can't ride pillion here, eh?

256
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.792 line:82%
Made off with Victoria.
Ali gets a mighty zero.

257
00:40:45.792 --> 00:40:49.625 line:82%
3 days. And Victoria will
be planning our wedding.

258
00:40:49.917 --> 00:40:53.917 line:82%
Confirmed. 3 days. Only Ali...

259
00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:05.875 line:82%
Hi.

260
00:41:07.292 --> 00:41:11.250 line:82%
I need the ventilation fixed
by tonight. OK?

261
00:41:11.833 --> 00:41:17.917 line:82%
We've rehearsed for a year.
Never imagined we'd perform here.

262
00:41:18.917 --> 00:41:21.917 line:82%
How did you do it? A real miracle.

263
00:41:22.417 --> 00:41:25.417 line:82%
Didn't do it alone.
The bank lent a hand.

264
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000 line:82%
See you.

265
00:41:28.208 --> 00:41:34.000 line:82%
- Where's the girl for my act?
- Auditioned dozens. No luck.

266
00:41:34.417 --> 00:41:36.875 line:82%
What kind of girl are you
looking for?

267
00:41:41.708 --> 00:41:44.667 line:82%
I want a girl passionate about
proving herself.

268
00:41:45.125 --> 00:41:48.125 line:82%
Someone with guts and lots
of craziness.

269
00:41:48.667 --> 00:41:51.667 line:82%
Auditions are now closed.
Thank you for coming.

270
00:42:02.292 --> 00:42:03.333 line:82%
Stop.

271
00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:06.042 line:82%
Ma'am, please stop.

272
00:42:06.542 --> 00:42:08.167 line:82%
Does such a girl exist?

273
00:42:09.542 --> 00:42:11.625 line:82%
You need a jeweler's eye.

274
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.750 line:82%
Stop her, catch her.

275
00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:17.625 line:82%
Oh no, not this girl again.

276
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.750 line:82%
Who is she?

277
00:42:18.958 --> 00:42:21.000 line:82%
She's nuts. I keep throwing her out.

278
00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:23.375 line:82%
Hey miss, listen
you cannot do this.

279
00:42:23.792 --> 00:42:24.958 line:82%
Wait! Just give me a minute.

280
00:42:25.958 --> 00:42:28.750 line:82%
- I won't leave today.
- You're crazy.

281
00:42:29.208 --> 00:42:30.542 line:82%
Give me a chance, please.

282
00:42:30.833 --> 00:42:33.000 line:82%
- This isn't a reality show
- It's a circus?

283
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.250 line:82%
I am a circus myself.

284
00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:43.792 line:82%
No, wait put me down.
Listen, let go.

285
00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:45.333 line:82%
One minute.

286
00:42:45.542 --> 00:42:46.875 line:82%
Put me down.

287
00:42:48.167 --> 00:42:49.333 line:82%
Stupid man.

288
00:42:53.708 --> 00:42:54.250 line:82%
You are...?

289
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.667 line:82%
The girl you're looking for.

290
00:42:59.625 --> 00:43:02.667 line:82%
Asian Goddess who sings and dances
like liquid electricity.

291
00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:08.375 line:82%
He won't believe me.
Please, one audition.

292
00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:10.542 line:82%
5 minutes.

293
00:43:11.125 --> 00:43:15.167 line:82%
If my eyes move off you,
even for a second, you're out.

294
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.875 line:82%
And no coming back.

295
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000 line:82%
Promise. I swear on my
unborn children.

296
00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:46.292 line:82%
I'll pacify the lover who turns away.

297
00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:52.625 line:82%
Blow away all veils.

298
00:43:54.125 --> 00:43:59.667 line:82%
I will melt Raanjha's heart of stone.

299
00:44:01.542 --> 00:44:06.625 line:82%
Then they'll call me
the love-crazed one.

300
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.667 line:82%
Then they'll call me
the love-crazed one.

301
00:44:33.875 --> 00:44:36.042 line:82%
He's my eternal lover.

302
00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:38.458 line:82%
I am forever his.

303
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:41.083 line:82%
Evening passes, the world sleeps.

304
00:44:42.167 --> 00:44:44.042 line:82%
And I wait for you.

305
00:44:44.917 --> 00:44:47.167 line:82%
He's my eternal lover.

306
00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:49.500 line:82%
I am forever his.

307
00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:52.083 line:82%
Evening passes, the world sleeps.

308
00:44:53.042 --> 00:44:54.667 line:82%
And I wait for you.

309
00:44:55.917 --> 00:45:00.917 line:82%
I am the love-crazed one.

310
00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:06.125 line:82%
I am the love-crazed one.

311
00:45:07.167 --> 00:45:11.833 line:82%
Feelings flow like a river.

312
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:17.083 line:82%
I look for you in every lane
as evening falls.

313
00:45:17.708 --> 00:45:20.000 line:82%
Evening passes, the world sleeps.

314
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.750 line:82%
And I wait for you.

315
00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:25.375 line:82%
He's my eternal lover.

316
00:45:25.958 --> 00:45:28.000 line:82%
I am forever his.

317
00:45:28.708 --> 00:45:30.708 line:82%
Evening passes, the world sleeps.

318
00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:33.500 line:82%
And I wait for you.

319
00:45:58.875 --> 00:46:03.917 line:82%
Wearing saffron clothes,
I become a devotee.

320
00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:09.208 line:82%
My dark eyes will enchant you.

321
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.708 line:82%
The love-crazed one.

322
00:46:12.625 --> 00:46:14.042 line:82%
The love-crazed one.

323
00:46:15.417 --> 00:46:20.292 line:82%
Like the cool morning dew,
I steal the garden's scent.

324
00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:23.458 line:82%
I can turn into a roaring flood.

325
00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:25.958 line:82%
Or split a mountain.

326
00:46:26.292 --> 00:46:31.458 line:82%
I am the love-crazed one.

327
00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:36.917 line:82%
I am the love-crazed one.

328
00:46:37.708 --> 00:46:39.958 line:82%
You are everywhere.

329
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:42.417 line:82%
In every speck.

330
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:47.542 line:82%
In every shining star above.

331
00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:50.542 line:82%
Evening passes, the world sleeps.

332
00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:53.125 line:82%
And I wait for you.

333
00:46:53.792 --> 00:46:55.958 line:82%
He's my eternal lover.

334
00:46:56.542 --> 00:46:58.792 line:82%
I am forever his.

335
00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:01.417 line:82%
Evening passes, the world sleeps.

336
00:47:01.958 --> 00:47:03.958 line:82%
And I wait for you.

337
00:47:05.125 --> 00:47:09.542 line:82%
I am the love-crazed one.

338
00:47:10.208 --> 00:47:15.125 line:82%
I am the love-crazed one.

339
00:47:21.208 --> 00:47:26.000 line:82%
I am the love-crazed one.

340
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:31.542 line:82%
I am the love-crazed one.

341
00:47:42.667 --> 00:47:44.042 line:82%
5 minutes are done.

342
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.042 line:82%
Now look away.

343
00:47:46.958 --> 00:47:48.625 line:82%
I've been trying for ages.

344
00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:52.750 line:82%
Liar.

345
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:54.542 line:82%
Swear on my unborn children.

346
00:47:59.542 --> 00:48:02.792 line:82%
Asian goddess who sings and dances
like liquid electricity.

347
00:48:03.375 --> 00:48:05.208 line:82%
Isn't that name a bit too long?

348
00:48:05.958 --> 00:48:06.750 line:82%
Aliya.

349
00:48:11.625 --> 00:48:13.958 line:82%
Welcome to the Great
Indian Circus, Aliya.

350
00:48:15.417 --> 00:48:19.208 line:82%
- Kiki, you are fired
- What? What have I done?

351
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:28.167 line:82%
Two big robberies in a year.

352
00:48:28.625 --> 00:48:31.042 line:82%
Both times a message left in Hindi.

353
00:48:31.292 --> 00:48:33.333 line:82%
"Bankers! May you rot in hell!"

354
00:48:33.708 --> 00:48:36.208 line:82%
Both times a clown's face
left smiling.

355
00:48:38.375 --> 00:48:41.667 line:82%
Both times he robs different branches
of the same bank.

356
00:48:42.125 --> 00:48:43.458 line:82%
Two suppositions. A:

357
00:48:44.125 --> 00:48:46.000 line:82%
This bank is easier to rob
than the others.

358
00:48:46.625 --> 00:48:49.667 line:82%
B: That he only wants to rob
this bank.

359
00:48:50.292 --> 00:48:51.333 line:82%
He's good.

360
00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:53.917 line:82%
That's my boy.

361
00:48:54.333 --> 00:48:56.667 line:82%
Does this bank have any enemies?
People who hate it?

362
00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:59.667 line:82%
We're bankers. Everybody hates us.

363
00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:04.083 line:82%
All the lives you have wrecked,
people you've laid off...

364
00:49:04.458 --> 00:49:06.125 line:82%
...we're going to need
to know about it all.

365
00:49:06.375 --> 00:49:09.000 line:82%
Until then we can only hope
and pray for one thing.

366
00:49:09.375 --> 00:49:11.208 line:82%
That we don't get robbed again.

367
00:49:11.583 --> 00:49:12.333 line:82%
No.

368
00:49:12.708 --> 00:49:13.958 line:82%
That you do get robbed again.

369
00:49:14.542 --> 00:49:15.042 line:82%
And soon.

370
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:18.000 line:82%
You want him to rob us?

371
00:49:18.667 --> 00:49:19.542 line:82%
If you want to catch him.

372
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000 line:82%
What are you saying?

373
00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.000 line:82%
We make him rob again.

374
00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:24.125 line:82%
How?

375
00:49:26.083 --> 00:49:27.292 line:82%
We just ask him.

376
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.042 line:82%
Really nicely.

377
00:49:34.458 --> 00:49:36.500 line:82%
Welcome back to Max at 12.

378
00:49:36.875 --> 00:49:38.417 line:82%
Further on the Sunday news.

379
00:49:38.708 --> 00:49:41.958 line:82%
The clown thief who is laughing
all the way from the bank.

380
00:49:42.875 --> 00:49:47.292 line:82%
The Chicago police believe the thief
is an Asian. Leaves Hindi messages.

381
00:49:47.792 --> 00:49:50.708 line:82%
So they've asked the Indian police
to help.

382
00:49:51.083 --> 00:49:55.458 line:82%
Today we have with us India's
top cop, Mr. Jai Dixit.

383
00:49:57.333 --> 00:50:00.708 line:82%
What do you make of
our bank robber?

384
00:50:01.167 --> 00:50:02.500 line:82%
He's an amateur.

385
00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.375 line:82%
A "nausikhiya" in Hindi.

386
00:50:04.667 --> 00:50:08.083 line:82%
But he's managed to pull off
two daring heists.

387
00:50:09.042 --> 00:50:10.083 line:82%
Just got lucky.

388
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:12.083 line:82%
Why?

389
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000 line:82%
I don't think he's a pro.

390
00:50:16.417 --> 00:50:19.792 line:82%
A clever thief doesn't leave
so many clues behind.

391
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.125 line:82%
One thing is for sure. He runs fast.

392
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.583 line:82%
My advice to him is...

393
00:50:28.167 --> 00:50:29.458 line:82%
Get the hell out of town!

394
00:50:30.042 --> 00:50:32.083 line:82%
Do you think he'll strike again?

395
00:50:33.042 --> 00:50:34.708 line:82%
Not if he's smart.

396
00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:37.708 line:82%
It'll be a suicide mission.

397
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.083 line:82%
Everyone is scared.

398
00:50:39.417 --> 00:50:42.375 line:82%
They're not sure if the bank is safe.
They don't know what to do.

399
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.583 line:82%
No one needs to fear this thief.

400
00:50:46.458 --> 00:50:47.417 line:82%
He's a clown.

401
00:50:48.083 --> 00:50:49.875 line:82%
He makes a lot of empty noise.

402
00:50:50.375 --> 00:50:54.750 line:82%
When we catch him, he's bound
to entertain his fellow in-mates.

403
00:50:55.208 --> 00:50:58.167 line:82%
You're very confident.
You sure you'll catch him?

404
00:50:58.583 --> 00:51:01.333 line:82%
The destiny of thieves is in
the hands of the police.

405
00:51:02.042 --> 00:51:04.875 line:82%
And I have Mr. Clown's fate in mine.

406
00:51:24.708 --> 00:51:25.417 line:82%
- Hi.
- Hi.

407
00:51:25.917 --> 00:51:27.875 line:82%
I'd like to meet Mr.Jai Dixit, please.

408
00:51:39.708 --> 00:51:42.708 line:82%
Mr. Jai Dixit. India's finest cop.

409
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.875 line:82%
Delighted to meet you.
I'm Sahir Khan.

410
00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:49.292 line:82%
What can I do for you, Mr. Khan?

411
00:51:49.917 --> 00:51:51.917 line:82%
I wanted to share something.

412
00:51:52.333 --> 00:51:54.542 line:82%
I know it may sound strange.

413
00:51:55.333 --> 00:51:56.792 line:82%
But I can't stay silent.

414
00:51:58.125 --> 00:51:59.083 line:82%
Actually...

415
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:01.875 line:82%
I am the thief.

416
00:52:04.167 --> 00:52:05.208 line:82%
No one knows.

417
00:52:05.583 --> 00:52:07.083 line:82%
Except you, of course.

418
00:52:08.083 --> 00:52:09.042 line:82%
I don't get you.

419
00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:12.917 line:82%
The Great Indian Circus.

420
00:52:13.125 --> 00:52:14.750 line:82%
The name of my new circus.

421
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.250 line:82%
I stole a trick from the thief
you're after.

422
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.375 line:82%
It's my new circus act.

423
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.292 line:82%
Your Mr. Clown, your joker.

424
00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:27.125 line:82%
I know him.

425
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.083 line:82%
2005.
Circus Fantastico.

426
00:52:36.708 --> 00:52:38.083 line:82%
Michigan's travelling circus.

427
00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:39.667 line:82%
That's me.

428
00:52:39.958 --> 00:52:41.708 line:82%
And that's him.

429
00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:43.375 line:82%
He was a star.

430
00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:45.125 line:82%
Deservedly so.

431
00:52:45.917 --> 00:52:47.667 line:82%
We were mere circus artists.

432
00:52:48.042 --> 00:52:50.292 line:82%
But he wove pure magic.

433
00:52:52.167 --> 00:52:56.125 line:82%
He had no friends, no enemies.
Never spoke to anyone.

434
00:52:57.042 --> 00:53:00.083 line:82%
Show over. Back in his room
behind locked doors.

435
00:53:01.542 --> 00:53:03.083 line:82%
I used to call him:

436
00:53:03.542 --> 00:53:05.333 line:82%
Closemouthed Charlie.

437
00:53:08.583 --> 00:53:10.167 line:82%
He did the most amazing trick.

438
00:53:10.458 --> 00:53:12.833 line:82%
He'd fly in one direction.
And reappear from another.

439
00:53:13.417 --> 00:53:15.417 line:82%
He showed his act to our boss,
Mr. Robert.

440
00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:18.875 line:82%
I was sure he'd make our circus
famous.

441
00:53:21.042 --> 00:53:23.958 line:82%
But Mr. Robert wasn't keen
and said no.

442
00:53:25.542 --> 00:53:27.583 line:82%
Closemouthed Charlie was offended.

443
00:53:29.083 --> 00:53:31.083 line:82%
I heard him speak for the first time.

444
00:53:33.167 --> 00:53:35.250 line:82%
I can still remember
what he said that day.

445
00:53:35.917 --> 00:53:36.625 line:82%
Well?

446
00:53:38.333 --> 00:53:39.833 line:82%
"May you rot in hell!"

447
00:53:43.292 --> 00:53:46.042 line:82%
The next day he was gone.

448
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:50.583 line:82%
They say never hurt a clown's
feelings.

449
00:53:51.292 --> 00:53:52.333 line:82%
You'll get cursed.

450
00:53:53.833 --> 00:53:56.417 line:82%
How do you know the thief
is Closemouthed Charlie?

451
00:53:56.917 --> 00:54:01.167 line:82%
The press say the thief leaves
a clown's mask and a message.

452
00:54:02.083 --> 00:54:06.125 line:82%
How many clowns say:
"May you rot in hell?"

453
00:54:07.042 --> 00:54:09.333 line:82%
But why? Why rob a bank?

454
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:14.542 line:82%
I don't know. If he's the thief,
he must have a good reason.

455
00:54:15.792 --> 00:54:18.292 line:82%
Can you identify him in a line-up?

456
00:54:20.042 --> 00:54:21.250 line:82%
No one saw his face.

457
00:54:21.667 --> 00:54:23.917 line:82%
Always had his make-up on.

458
00:54:25.208 --> 00:54:27.958 line:82%
No one knows what he looks like.

459
00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:30.958 line:82%
But I think...

460
00:54:31.667 --> 00:54:32.833 line:82%
...I can help you.

461
00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:34.000 line:82%
How?

462
00:54:34.458 --> 00:54:37.667 line:82%
He and I are men of the circus.
We seek applause.

463
00:54:38.333 --> 00:54:41.417 line:82%
The only difference is that
I act on the stage.

464
00:54:42.042 --> 00:54:45.167 line:82%
While he has turned the whole city
into his stage.

465
00:54:46.708 --> 00:54:48.708 line:82%
Closemouthed Charlie is a genius.

466
00:54:49.417 --> 00:54:50.917 line:82%
I'm not. But...

467
00:54:51.458 --> 00:54:53.667 line:82%
I can think somewhat like him.

468
00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:56.583 line:82%
But why?

469
00:54:58.833 --> 00:55:01.875 line:82%
- Why help me?
- Actually I want to help him.

470
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.917 line:82%
Helping you is helping him.

471
00:55:05.375 --> 00:55:07.333 line:82%
I want him caught.

472
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.583 line:82%
Because he isn't a thief.

473
00:55:10.708 --> 00:55:12.958 line:82%
Maybe he's lost his way.
Something has gone wrong.

474
00:55:13.708 --> 00:55:15.542 line:82%
This is the only way I can save him.

475
00:55:15.875 --> 00:55:18.042 line:82%
I want to, at any cost.

476
00:55:19.125 --> 00:55:20.708 line:82%
He's done so much for me.

477
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:22.958 line:82%
I owe it to him.

478
00:55:23.458 --> 00:55:25.958 line:82%
It may be your last chance
to save him.

479
00:55:26.583 --> 00:55:28.000 line:82%
Because this time...

480
00:55:28.542 --> 00:55:30.250 line:82%
...we put an end to the heists.

481
00:55:31.667 --> 00:55:32.708 line:82%
Or to the thief.

482
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.833 line:82%
Wow! I love your confidence.

483
00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:41.167 line:82%
Sahir, what you're doing
is a great help.

484
00:55:44.042 --> 00:55:45.292 line:82%
See you at the bank tomorrow.

485
00:55:45.708 --> 00:55:46.708 line:82%
At 9?

486
00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.083 line:82%
Done.

487

WESTERN BANK OF CHICAGO.

488
00:56:27.708 --> 00:56:29.417 line:82%
Comic, comedian, funny man.

489
00:56:29.958 --> 00:56:31.958 line:82%
Fool, joker, clown.

490
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:34.208 line:82%
I go by many names.

491
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:36.750 line:82%
My personal favourite: jester.

492
00:56:37.208 --> 00:56:38.667 line:82%
The very name is amusing.

493
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.458 line:82%
Thanks for coming.

494
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.375 line:82%
Thank me once I've helped you.

495
00:57:02.167 --> 00:57:02.958 line:82%
This way.

496
00:57:09.417 --> 00:57:11.667 line:82%
Playing the clown is serious business.

497
00:57:13.083 --> 00:57:16.083 line:82%
Because a clown's tricks
are all about deception.

498
00:57:25.958 --> 00:57:26.708 line:82%
Excuse me.

499
00:57:30.958 --> 00:57:33.583 line:82%
A good clown is a meticulous planner.

500
00:57:34.667 --> 00:57:37.583 line:82%
Because our mission is no joke.
It's a fight.

501
00:57:38.458 --> 00:57:39.083 line:82%
A battle.

502
00:58:27.458 --> 00:58:31.000 line:82%
A battle the audience thinks
they're winning.

503
00:58:31.917 --> 00:58:33.417 line:82%
But we win.

504
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.333 line:82%
Always.

505
00:58:37.708 --> 00:58:40.708 line:82%
Flies in one direction,
reappears from another?

506
00:58:41.625 --> 00:58:43.917 line:82%
How do you do it,
Closemouthed Charlie?

507
00:58:46.125 --> 00:58:49.667 line:82%
If I were Closemouthed Charlie,
I'd rob today.

508
00:58:50.083 --> 00:58:51.917 line:82%
Why today?

509
00:58:54.292 --> 00:58:55.125 line:82%
1st April.

510
00:58:55.542 --> 00:58:56.917 line:82%
Clown's Day.

511
00:58:57.583 --> 00:58:59.125 line:82%
We're rehearsing for the
opening show tonight.

512
00:58:59.417 --> 00:59:01.792 line:82%
Can't take calls.
Thought I'd warn you.

513
00:59:02.167 --> 00:59:02.833 line:82%
Thank you.

514
00:59:03.125 --> 00:59:05.542 line:82%
You're most welcome.
All the best.

515
00:59:09.042 --> 00:59:10.125 line:82%
It's showtime.

516

WESTERN BANK OF CHICAGO.

517
00:59:27.417 --> 00:59:30.208 line:82%
Victoria, where are you?

518
00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:35.458 line:82%
My eyes have turned to stone,
looking for you.

519
00:59:38.958 --> 00:59:40.875 line:82%
Your brain has turned to stone.

520
00:59:41.375 --> 00:59:43.958 line:82%
You're looking for a thief,
not a girl. Got it?

521
00:59:44.167 --> 00:59:46.417 line:82%
Passing time. Swear on Mummy.

522
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.750 line:82%
He's going to strike today.

523
00:59:49.625 --> 00:59:50.583 line:82%
Be alert.

524
00:59:50.875 --> 00:59:52.625 line:82%
Alert.

525
00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:57.250 line:82%
Alert.

526
01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:01.792 line:82%
Alert? Means?

527
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000 line:82%
"Bankers! May you rot in hell!"

528
01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:30.917 line:82%
Don't move!

529
01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:34.208 line:82%
Turn around. Let's see your hands.

530
01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:43.292 line:82%
Show me your hands.

531
01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:50.667 line:82%
Bomb! Back up!

532
01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:30.750 line:82%
Police headquarters? Suspect
heading east on a black bike.

533
01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:59.250 line:82%
- Don't let him get to the lakeshore.
- Where is it?

534
01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:10.250 line:82%
- What are you doing?
- Police work.

535
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:47.250 line:82%
Move.

536
01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:08.250 line:82%
That's my boat.

537
01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:33.542 line:82%
Help!

538
01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:58.292 line:82%
Let the thief run, the boat smash.
Ali is here! Ladies, no danger.

539
01:08:03.583 --> 01:08:04.292 line:82%
Stop!

540
01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:07.875 line:82%
Stop! Or we'll shoot.

541
01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:09.792 line:82%
Stop!

542
01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:05.125 line:82%
Suspect is heading to Lower Wacker.

543
01:10:06.292 --> 01:10:09.958 line:82%
He's shot. I repeat, he's shot.
Do you copy?

544
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:42.792 line:82%
Vanished into thin air.
How does he do it?

545
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:44.833 line:82%
I'm his fan.

546
01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:47.750 line:82%
- Let's go
- Where to?

547
01:10:48.375 --> 01:10:50.333 line:82%
From where he can't escape.

548
01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:52.083 line:82%
The Great Indian Circus.

549
01:10:52.583 --> 01:10:53.958 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen.

550
01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:57.583 line:82%
Welcome to the opening night of
the Great Indian Circus.

551

Please proceed towards your seats.

552
01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:16.833 line:82%
People of God are we.

553
01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:19.667 line:82%
Who can defy us?

554
01:11:20.583 --> 01:11:24.833 line:82%
Basking under a thousand suns
of hope.

555
01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:27.292 line:82%
With steely resolve.

556
01:11:27.792 --> 01:11:29.625 line:82%
With fearless step.

557
01:11:30.083 --> 01:11:32.542 line:82%
Today we set forth to write...

558
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.333 line:82%
...our destiny.

559
01:12:30.625 --> 01:12:32.125 line:82%
Love on my lips.

560
01:12:33.333 --> 01:12:36.542 line:82%
Love in my prayers. In body...

561
01:12:36.875 --> 01:12:38.000 line:82%
...in soul.

562
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.292 line:82%
Love is all.

563
01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:43.333 line:82%
Love in my eyes.

564
01:12:44.417 --> 01:12:45.833 line:82%
Love in mankind.

565
01:12:46.708 --> 01:12:49.083 line:82%
Love in image and dance.

566
01:12:49.333 --> 01:12:51.333 line:82%
Love is everywhere.

567
01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:57.667 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

568
01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:01.792 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

569
01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:08.792 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

570
01:13:09.292 --> 01:13:13.042 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

571
01:13:26.042 --> 01:13:31.167 line:82%
Love is a wanderer.

572
01:13:31.625 --> 01:13:36.542 line:82%
Love flows through life.

573
01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:42.417 line:82%
Be washed away by love.

574
01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:45.542 line:82%
Crazed by love.

575
01:13:48.292 --> 01:13:52.625 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

576
01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:57.333 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

577
01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:04.250 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

578
01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:08.375 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

579
01:14:43.458 --> 01:14:48.125 line:82%
All my prayers.

580
01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:53.583 line:82%
You intoxicate my world.

581
01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:58.750 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

582
01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:04.792 line:82%
Your light shines on me.

583
01:15:05.583 --> 01:15:10.167 line:82%
My heart is yours.

584
01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:15.125 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

585
01:15:16.875 --> 01:15:19.542 line:82%
I see you wherever I go.

586
01:15:19.917 --> 01:15:22.042 line:82%
I pine and yearn for you.

587
01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:26.000 line:82%
Lost in devotion and love for you.

588
01:15:27.708 --> 01:15:33.083 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

589
01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:36.917 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

590
01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:10.625 line:82%
I descend from the sky
to find you.

591
01:17:10.958 --> 01:17:13.292 line:82%
You are boundless faith.

592
01:17:13.792 --> 01:17:16.250 line:82%
I will live in your care.

593
01:17:16.667 --> 01:17:20.917 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

594
01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:24.542 line:82%
Words don't console,
nor stories distract.

595
01:17:24.708 --> 01:17:27.167 line:82%
Only you bring peace.

596
01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:28.583 line:82%
You are my guide.

597
01:17:28.917 --> 01:17:30.083 line:82%
You are my friend.

598
01:17:30.292 --> 01:17:32.792 line:82%
You affect my whole being.

599
01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:37.167 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

600
01:17:38.625 --> 01:17:41.458 line:82%
Overcome with love for you.

601
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:43.917 line:82%
A fire burns in my heart for you.

602
01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:48.250 line:82%
I am yours. Lost in love for you.

603
01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:55.000 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

604
01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:59.208 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

605
01:18:00.667 --> 01:18:06.000 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

606
01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:10.333 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

607
01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:17.125 line:82%
I am crazed with love for you.

608
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.958 line:82%
Crazed with love for you.

609
01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:41.042 line:82%
- Come on, guys. Pack up fast
- Great show tonight, boss.

610
01:20:03.375 --> 01:20:05.708 line:82%
Sir, put your hands behind
your head, please.

611
01:20:08.417 --> 01:20:10.083 line:82%
You really can endure pain.

612
01:20:11.292 --> 01:20:12.458 line:82%
What's this about, Jai?

613
01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:14.417 line:82%
Closemouthed Charlie.

614
01:20:16.208 --> 01:20:18.208 line:82%
The mysterious clown.

615
01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:20.375 line:82%
Unseen by all.

616
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.375 line:82%
Nice story.

617
01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:25.958 line:82%
I'd like to believe you, but...

618
01:20:26.375 --> 01:20:28.917 line:82%
...believing stories isn't my job.

619
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:34.292 line:82%
I believe only what my eyes see.

620
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.917 line:82%
Trying to help us was a smart way...

621
01:20:40.208 --> 01:20:43.792 line:82%
...of checking the bank's
security systems.

622
01:20:44.583 --> 01:20:46.792 line:82%
Only three men knew...

623
01:20:47.583 --> 01:20:50.250 line:82%
...the new security codes.

624
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.375 line:82%
Two officers and...

625
01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:54.542 line:82%
...a thief.

626
01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:56.792 line:82%
Me?

627
01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:59.625 line:82%
The jacket and shirt,
take it off.

628
01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:01.000 line:82%
What?

629
01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:04.000 line:82%
Why?

630
01:21:04.958 --> 01:21:06.708 line:82%
A 9mm bullet...

631
01:21:07.708 --> 01:21:10.125 line:82%
...always leaves a mark.

632
01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:12.250 line:82%
Take it off.

633
01:21:13.292 --> 01:21:14.250 line:82%
Making a mistake, Jai.

634
01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:16.042 line:82%
Now!

635
01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:42.000 line:82%
Not a scratch.

636
01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:43.708 line:82%
What?

637
01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:44.750 line:82%
Nothing.

638
01:21:51.042 --> 01:21:52.208 line:82%
Sergeant, body scanner.

639
01:21:57.542 --> 01:21:58.333 line:82%
He's clean, sir.

640
01:21:58.708 --> 01:22:00.000 line:82%
It can't be. Give it to me.

641
01:22:06.042 --> 01:22:07.125 line:82%
What do you want?

642
01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:11.458 line:82%
No one can hide a bullet wound
that easily.

643
01:22:11.792 --> 01:22:13.250 line:82%
How did you do it?

644
01:22:15.375 --> 01:22:16.833 line:82%
I'm a circus man.

645
01:22:17.292 --> 01:22:18.667 line:82%
Tricks are my trade.

646
01:22:18.958 --> 01:22:20.708 line:82%
That bullet came from my gun.

647
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.583 line:82%
I showed you a hand of friendship.

648
01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:30.708 line:82%
A cop and thief can only be enemies.

649
01:22:32.042 --> 01:22:34.583 line:82%
Let's go.

650
01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:37.875 line:82%
Sir, we have to go now.
We're very sorry, sir.

651
01:22:39.292 --> 01:22:40.833 line:82%
Actually I am sorry.

652
01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:43.417 line:82%
I regret...

653
01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:46.000 line:82%
...I didn't aim between your eyes.

654
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.667 line:82%
Promise I won't make that
mistake again.

655
01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:01.958 line:82%
What's your trick?

656
01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:07.208 line:82%
Pity we aren't friends.

657
01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:09.125 line:82%
Or I'd tell you for sure.

658
01:23:09.917 --> 01:23:11.792 line:82%
Don't know about friendship.

659
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:17.042 line:82%
But I'm a real good enemy.
Never forget it.

660
01:25:04.125 --> 01:25:06.000 line:82%
Is it hurting a lot?

661
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:14.250 line:82%
People of God are we.

662
01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:18.500 line:82%
Who can defy us?

663
01:25:20.083 --> 01:25:22.333 line:82%
People of God are we.

664
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.917 line:82%
Who can defy us?

665
01:25:27.792 --> 01:25:33.417 line:82%
Basking under a thousand suns
of hope.

666
01:25:36.917 --> 01:25:39.000 line:82%
With steely resolve.

667
01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:41.458 line:82%
With fearless step.

668
01:25:43.667 --> 01:25:46.708 line:82%
Today we set forth to write...

669
01:25:47.958 --> 01:25:50.333 line:82%
...our destiny.

670
01:26:33.667 --> 01:26:36.042 line:82%
- Where's my box?
- Your box?

671
01:26:36.833 --> 01:26:38.167 line:82%
No time for fun and games.

672
01:26:38.875 --> 01:26:40.000 line:82%
Say please.

673
01:26:41.125 --> 01:26:41.917 line:82%
Are you nuts?

674
01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:46.458 line:82%
Please, His Highness
Samar the Great.

675
01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:48.083 line:82%
Where's my box?

676
01:26:52.167 --> 01:26:54.208 line:82%
The pawnshop closes at 6.

677
01:27:06.083 --> 01:27:08.083 line:82%
You'll get nothing for that.

678
01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:10.708 line:82%
Here.

679
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.917 line:82%
Keep your watch.
You'll be crying later.

680
01:27:13.542 --> 01:27:14.792 line:82%
Two rings.

681
01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:16.708 line:82%
Silver symbol AG.

682
01:27:17.208 --> 01:27:19.167 line:82%
5.5 grams.

683
01:27:19.708 --> 01:27:23.583 line:82%
Total price: 6.070 dollars.

684
01:27:25.083 --> 01:27:29.750 line:82%
Casio G Shock. DW 5000.

685
01:27:30.417 --> 01:27:32.708 line:82%
Street price: 20 dollars.

686
01:27:33.292 --> 01:27:34.917 line:82%
Don't be too smart.

687
01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:36.583 line:82%
I am smart.

688
01:27:39.667 --> 01:27:42.083 line:82%
His Highness Samar the Great.
Thank you.

689
01:27:47.875 --> 01:27:49.667 line:82%
People of God are we.

690
01:27:50.125 --> 01:27:51.500 line:82%
Who can defy us?

691
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.542 line:82%
Basking under a thousand suns...

692
01:27:54.458 --> 01:27:55.625 line:82%
...of hope.

693
01:27:56.375 --> 01:27:58.417 line:82%
With steely resolve.

694
01:27:59.042 --> 01:28:00.958 line:82%
With fearless step.

695
01:28:02.125 --> 01:28:04.250 line:82%
Today we set forth...

696
01:28:05.083 --> 01:28:06.958 line:82%
...to write our destiny.

697
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:17.917 line:82%
And now, gentlemen, my new act.

698
01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:22.583 line:82%
An act that has never
been seen before.

699
01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:38.583 line:82%
We were father's two hands.

700
01:28:39.667 --> 01:28:40.875 line:82%
One unseen.

701
01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:42.625 line:82%
The other seen.

702
01:28:44.208 --> 01:28:47.042 line:82%
Papa would say everyone has
a secret.

703
01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:50.250 line:82%
I was his secret. Me.

704
01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:53.542 line:82%
The ace in his deck of cards.

705
01:28:55.042 --> 01:29:00.375 line:82%
Papa, you had another secret
you hid from us that day.

706
01:29:09.417 --> 01:29:13.917 line:82%
You said: "You're my secret,
the key to the trick.

707
01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:18.125 line:82%
"No one must know.
Always stay invisible."

708
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.083 line:82%
So no one saw me.
No one heard me.

709
01:29:25.917 --> 01:29:29.708 line:82%
I stayed hidden in the box.
I wasn't scared.

710
01:29:30.292 --> 01:29:34.208 line:82%
But seeing you like that...
terrified me.

711
01:29:35.292 --> 01:29:39.167 line:82%
Scared I shan't walk on your back
anymore.

712
01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:41.000 line:82%
Who'd massage you?

713
01:29:41.292 --> 01:29:44.417 line:82%
Who'd tell you: "Papa, you've
missed that bit."

714
01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:50.917 line:82%
- Nothing escapes you
- I see all. Remember all.

715
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:53.500 line:82%
That's why I hide you.

716
01:29:54.625 --> 01:29:56.167 line:82%
You're my secret.

717
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.583 line:82%
My angel. If anyone saw you,
they'd steal you away from me.

718
01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:07.500 line:82%
Still carrying him?

719
01:30:08.042 --> 01:30:09.750 line:82%
He's a big boy now. You spoil him.

720
01:30:10.292 --> 01:30:12.167 line:82%
I'm father's angel.

721
01:30:12.667 --> 01:30:14.958 line:82%
Angels don't touch the ground.

722
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.500 line:82%
Angel? You pistachio.
I'll eat you up.

723
01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:23.000 line:82%
I smell the bad smell of jealousy.

724
01:30:31.417 --> 01:30:32.208 line:82%
Bravo!

725
01:30:45.792 --> 01:30:46.875 line:82%
Say thank you.

726
01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.792 line:82%
Don't let go, Samar.

727
01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:56.083 line:82%
Never let go of Sahir's hand.

728
01:30:57.917 --> 01:30:59.000 line:82%
Never.

729
01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:01.375 line:82%
Never leave his side.

730
01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:06.250 line:82%
Never let go of his hand.
Never leave his side.

731
01:31:08.583 --> 01:31:11.292 line:82%
Never let go of his hand.
Never leave his side.

732
01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:14.542 line:82%
His Highness Samar the Great.

733
01:31:15.208 --> 01:31:16.708 line:82%
Have your medicine.

734
01:31:19.542 --> 01:31:20.958 line:82%
Papa was gone.

735
01:31:21.708 --> 01:31:22.750 line:82%
But the bank is still here.

736
01:31:23.208 --> 01:31:26.833 line:82%
Always will be. Because no one
can destroy a bank.

737
01:31:28.875 --> 01:31:30.417 line:82%
It's made of stone.

738
01:31:31.042 --> 01:31:32.500 line:82%
The bank's face and heart.

739
01:31:32.875 --> 01:31:34.833 line:82%
And mind...all stone.

740
01:31:36.667 --> 01:31:38.167 line:82%
That day we both knew...

741
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.667 line:82%
...we'd destroy it.

742
01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:42.500 line:82%
They didn't like our act.

743
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.042 line:82%
We'll show them.

744
01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:45.625 line:82%
Again and again.

745
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.750 line:82%
We won't stop till we perish.

746
01:31:48.958 --> 01:31:50.208 line:82%
Or the bank perishes.

747
01:32:26.042 --> 01:32:27.292 line:82%
The world sees one.

748
01:32:27.917 --> 01:32:28.917 line:82%
But we're two.

749
01:32:29.250 --> 01:32:30.292 line:82%
One seen.

750
01:32:31.542 --> 01:32:32.375 line:82%
The other unseen.

751
01:33:04.375 --> 01:33:06.958 line:82%
Papa said I was his angel.

752
01:33:08.375 --> 01:33:10.250 line:82%
Angels have blessed me.

753
01:33:11.292 --> 01:33:12.375 line:82%
I forget nothing.

754
01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:16.000 line:82%
That's my great talent.

755
01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:19.083 line:82%
God's gift to me. His reward.

756
01:33:20.292 --> 01:33:22.667 line:82%
A reward shared with the bank.

757
01:33:28.917 --> 01:33:31.125 line:82%
This passage is very narrow.

758
01:34:23.292 --> 01:34:24.792 line:82%
What's in it?

759
01:34:26.375 --> 01:34:28.083 line:82%
What smells so good?

760
01:34:29.292 --> 01:34:31.125 line:82%
It's a secret.

761
01:34:36.667 --> 01:34:40.125 line:82%
Some things are best left a secret.

762
01:34:41.083 --> 01:34:43.708 line:82%
Maybe everyone has a secret...

763
01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.292 line:82%
...they never share.

764
01:34:47.292 --> 01:34:49.292 line:82%
They just can't.

765
01:34:50.542 --> 01:34:51.917 line:82%
Haven't even told Sahir.

766
01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:54.958 line:82%
But I'll tell you, Papa.

767
01:34:56.083 --> 01:34:57.708 line:82%
My secret is...

768
01:35:04.167 --> 01:35:05.042 line:82%
Aliya.

769
01:35:09.625 --> 01:35:13.708 line:82%
No one in the world is as lovely
as Aliya.

770
01:35:16.833 --> 01:35:18.792 line:82%
The most beautiful girl.

771
01:35:19.583 --> 01:35:21.583 line:82%
With the nicest name.

772
01:35:23.917 --> 01:35:24.833 line:82%
Aliya.

773
01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:32.917 line:82%
Even when I'm far from her
it's all right.

774
01:36:34.083 --> 01:36:37.208 line:82%
I like saying her name.

775
01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:40.750 line:82%
I like thinking of her.

776
01:36:42.792 --> 01:36:44.250 line:82%
It's silly, but...

777
01:36:45.125 --> 01:36:46.333 line:82%
...I like it.

778
01:36:48.833 --> 01:36:50.750 line:82%
Good night, Aliya.

779
01:37:01.542 --> 01:37:03.042 line:82%
Mr. Jai Dixit...

780
01:37:03.875 --> 01:37:05.125 line:82%
...we regret to inform you...

781
01:37:05.542 --> 01:37:08.375 line:82%
...that your services are no longer
required on this case.

782
01:37:08.875 --> 01:37:11.000 line:82%
The bank and the police...

783
01:37:11.917 --> 01:37:13.708 line:82%
...no longer have confidence in you.

784
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:17.958 line:82%
From today all your access and
special powers are revoked.

785
01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:19.833 line:82%
You'll hand over...

786
01:37:20.083 --> 01:37:23.958 line:82%
...any materials you have
and any firearms.

787
01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:33.625 line:82%
- Where are we going?
- Home.

788
01:37:34.167 --> 01:37:38.708 line:82%
Mumbai's lock-up? Rum at night?
Michael Jackson's tea at dawn?

789
01:37:39.208 --> 01:37:42.542 line:82%
The airport train leaves in
5 minutes. Quiet now.

790
01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:47.125 line:82%
Ali was a punter. Now a cop.
Respected...

791
01:37:47.792 --> 01:37:49.042 line:82%
...thanks to you.

792
01:37:49.667 --> 01:37:51.625 line:82%
Being with you is scary.

793
01:37:52.167 --> 01:37:54.083 line:82%
The fear of death looms over us.

794
01:37:54.833 --> 01:37:56.625 line:82%
But never the risk of losing face.

795
01:37:57.042 --> 01:37:58.417 line:82%
Today you might...

796
01:37:59.417 --> 01:38:00.292 line:82%
...lose face.

797
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:06.542 line:82%
Know what they'll say?

798
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.125 line:82%
Those idiot cops ran back to India,
tail between their legs.

799
01:38:13.583 --> 01:38:16.667 line:82%
The impression we make
in foreign countries sticks.

800
01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:20.917 line:82%
When did a mad cap like you need
an invite to catch a thief?

801
01:38:22.542 --> 01:38:25.792 line:82%
Anyone dumping on your name
must be screwed.

802
01:38:27.625 --> 01:38:31.792 line:82%
Think of a cracking idea.
Wash away this humiliation.

803
01:38:34.583 --> 01:38:38.375 line:82%
I live in your shadow. No problem
for me.

804
01:38:39.292 --> 01:38:44.917 line:82%
At home every overworked, underpaid
cop pins his hopes on you.

805
01:38:46.292 --> 01:38:50.208 line:82%
For us your name is another word
for honour, Jai.

806
01:38:52.917 --> 01:38:54.125 line:82%
Don't change that.

807
01:39:05.667 --> 01:39:06.708 line:82%
What now?

808
01:39:08.083 --> 01:39:11.000 line:82%
Running tail between the legs
is cancelled.

809
01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:14.583 line:82%
Operation screw him starts!

810
01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:17.458 line:82%
Jai-Ali style.

811
01:39:21.958 --> 01:39:23.625 line:82%
This isn't our country.

812
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.750 line:82%
But we're police officers.

813
01:39:26.292 --> 01:39:28.917 line:82%
Till now we were bound by rules
and protocol.

814
01:39:29.958 --> 01:39:31.667 line:82%
We came here all compliant.

815
01:39:32.458 --> 01:39:35.542 line:82%
But when we leave,
we go with a blast.

816
01:39:40.042 --> 01:39:42.083 line:82%
Glad we stayed.

817
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.375 line:82%
But how do we figure out
how he operates?

818
01:39:46.958 --> 01:39:48.542 line:82%
Remember his circus trick?

819
01:39:48.833 --> 01:39:52.000 line:82%
He's the king of the circus.
I'm his great fan.

820
01:39:53.417 --> 01:39:55.917 line:82%
To understand how he robs banks...

821
01:39:56.708 --> 01:39:58.250 line:82%
...we must understand his circus act.

822
01:39:58.875 --> 01:40:01.750 line:82%
Brother, my brain is raisin-size.
Small but sweet.

823
01:40:02.167 --> 01:40:04.750 line:82%
Don't overload it. You decide
how we get him.

824
01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:06.375 line:82%
We find answers.

825
01:40:07.125 --> 01:40:08.000 line:82%
Victoria.

826
01:40:09.458 --> 01:40:10.875 line:82%
And all our answers...

827
01:40:12.208 --> 01:40:13.292 line:82%
...are here.

828
01:40:14.625 --> 01:40:16.333 line:82%
Sahir is hiding something.

829
01:40:19.375 --> 01:40:22.583 line:82%
Finding the hidden is something
I enjoy.

830
01:40:45.042 --> 01:40:47.208 line:82%
You're like dappled sunlight.

831
01:40:48.583 --> 01:40:51.000 line:82%
Golden like the sunset.

832
01:40:52.167 --> 01:40:55.250 line:82%
My heart tells me to let myself go...

833
01:40:55.833 --> 01:40:58.125 line:82%
...as I say your name.

834
01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:31.292 line:82%
You're like dappled sunlight.

835
01:41:32.458 --> 01:41:34.583 line:82%
Golden like the sunset.

836
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.833 line:82%
My heart tells me to let myself go...

837
01:41:39.625 --> 01:41:41.667 line:82%
...as I say your name.

838
01:41:43.208 --> 01:41:45.000 line:82%
If you go, the day goes by.

839
01:41:46.792 --> 01:41:48.458 line:82%
If you down, the night goes by.

840
01:41:50.333 --> 01:41:52.667 line:82%
My heart tells me to sacrifice life...

841
01:41:53.917 --> 01:41:55.000 line:82%
...for you.

842
01:41:56.417 --> 01:41:59.000 line:82%
You're my affliction.

843
01:41:59.958 --> 01:42:01.583 line:82%
You're my cure.

844
01:42:03.625 --> 01:42:06.333 line:82%
You're my affliction.

845
01:42:07.125 --> 01:42:08.375 line:82%
You're my cure.

846
01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:40.042 line:82%
All the stars.

847
01:42:44.583 --> 01:42:47.458 line:82%
Have lost their shine.

848
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.250 line:82%
All day.

849
01:42:53.458 --> 01:42:59.250 line:82%
I dream of you.

850
01:43:05.583 --> 01:43:11.167 line:82%
Enchaining me with love.

851
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:15.417 line:82%
My heart tells me...

852
01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:18.583 line:82%
...to surrender to you.

853
01:43:19.917 --> 01:43:22.250 line:82%
You're a quivering arrow.

854
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.000 line:82%
A two-edged sword.

855
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.625 line:82%
My heart tells me with a smile...

856
01:43:30.583 --> 01:43:32.542 line:82%
...to endure all suffering
you inflict.

857
01:43:33.125 --> 01:43:35.583 line:82%
You're my affliction.

858
01:43:36.708 --> 01:43:38.250 line:82%
You're my cure.

859
01:43:40.208 --> 01:43:43.042 line:82%
You're my affliction.

860
01:43:43.875 --> 01:43:45.333 line:82%
You're my cure.

861
01:44:06.250 --> 01:44:10.708 line:82%
The dark sky seems to brighten.

862
01:44:13.458 --> 01:44:18.042 line:82%
The clouds seem to part now.

863
01:44:20.583 --> 01:44:25.417 line:82%
Night has turned to day
since I have found you.

864
01:44:27.792 --> 01:44:32.167 line:82%
The scars on the moon
are washed away now.

865
01:44:35.083 --> 01:44:37.625 line:82%
I have etched your name...

866
01:44:38.708 --> 01:44:40.708 line:82%
...on my heart.

867
01:44:42.292 --> 01:44:47.125 line:82%
Tied your name in an amulet
to wear forever.

868
01:44:49.458 --> 01:44:51.250 line:82%
If you go, the day goes by.

869
01:44:53.042 --> 01:44:54.792 line:82%
If you down, the night goes by.

870
01:44:56.625 --> 01:44:58.917 line:82%
My heart tells me to sacrifice life...

871
01:45:00.167 --> 01:45:01.458 line:82%
...for you.

872
01:45:02.708 --> 01:45:04.792 line:82%
You're my affliction.

873
01:45:06.208 --> 01:45:08.042 line:82%
You're my cure.

874
01:45:09.833 --> 01:45:11.792 line:82%
You're my affliction.

875
01:45:13.375 --> 01:45:15.000 line:82%
You're my cure.

876
01:45:17.875 --> 01:45:19.500 line:82%
You're my affliction.

877
01:45:21.917 --> 01:45:23.125 line:82%
You're my cure.

878
01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:25.750 line:82%
You're my affliction.

879
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:29.208 line:82%
You're my cure.

880
01:45:31.375 --> 01:45:33.167 line:82%
You're my affliction.

881
01:45:35.167 --> 01:45:36.750 line:82%
You're my cure.

882
01:45:38.458 --> 01:45:40.125 line:82%
You're my affliction.

883
01:45:42.042 --> 01:45:43.542 line:82%
You're my cure.

884
01:46:55.667 --> 01:46:57.750 line:82%
You wore my costume again.

885
01:46:58.083 --> 01:47:01.042 line:82%
How does it matter? No time
for fun and games.

886
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000 line:82%
I know you wore my costume
on purpose.

887
01:47:19.458 --> 01:47:22.125 line:82%
On purpose? Your costume?
I smell jealousy.

888
01:47:29.792 --> 01:47:34.000 line:82%
- My cable is tight. Loosen it.
- No, safety first.

889
01:47:34.875 --> 01:47:35.792 line:82%
I'll be fine.

890
01:47:36.458 --> 01:47:40.750 line:82%
I fly across 400ft and land on
the stage in 34 seconds.

891
01:47:41.792 --> 01:47:43.250 line:82%
Loosen the cable and...

892
01:47:43.625 --> 01:47:46.583 line:82%
...I'll somersault and make it
in 29 seconds.

893
01:47:47.083 --> 01:47:48.542 line:82%
Don't be too smart.

894
01:47:50.042 --> 01:47:52.083 line:82%
But I am smart. So?

895
01:47:52.667 --> 01:47:55.667 line:82%
Don't you think your entry is...

896
01:47:56.542 --> 01:47:59.958 line:82%
...too quick? Slow it down.
It'll look better.

897
01:48:00.292 --> 01:48:01.875 line:82%
More real. No?

898
01:48:03.375 --> 01:48:06.375 line:82%
Real? They come to see magic.
Why not show it?

899
01:48:06.875 --> 01:48:10.667 line:82%
- What time are rehearsals?
- Tomorrow's Sunday. Day off.

900
01:48:11.917 --> 01:48:14.792 line:82%
Samar, don't go out tomorrow.
Let's work on our new act.

901
01:48:15.542 --> 01:48:17.417 line:82%
I go to Six Flags tomorrow.

902
01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.083 line:82%
Please listen to me.

903
01:48:24.042 --> 01:48:25.708 line:82%
Why are you so stubborn?

904
01:48:27.917 --> 01:48:30.750 line:82%
Mr. Absent-Minded!
Forgot the box again.

905
01:48:31.958 --> 01:48:33.333 line:82%
Where's your mind?

906
01:48:43.417 --> 01:48:45.833 line:82%
He's a deadly mix, boss.

907
01:48:46.583 --> 01:48:48.375 line:82%
One seen, the other unseen.

908
01:48:49.417 --> 01:48:51.625 line:82%
One shot, the other checked.

909
01:48:52.375 --> 01:48:54.417 line:82%
Doesn't one brother look retarded?

910
01:48:55.292 --> 01:48:56.708 line:82%
Bit less than you.

911
01:48:57.750 --> 01:49:01.000 line:82%
Let me handle the retard.
You two go after Sahir.

912
01:49:02.042 --> 01:49:02.583 line:82%
What?

913
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.333 line:82%
The case is as transparent
as Lonavla's waterfall.

914
01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:10.000 line:82%
We know their secret now.

915
01:49:10.417 --> 01:49:14.583 line:82%
We walk in there and handcuff
those dead ringers.

916
01:49:14.958 --> 01:49:19.625 line:82%
- On what charge?
- They're twins. Two-in-one.

917
01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:22.333 line:82%
No crime in being twins, Ali.

918
01:49:22.875 --> 01:49:25.792 line:82%
If we arrest them now, we won't
get a stolen dime back.

919
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:27.542 line:82%
Sahir is too smart for that.

920
01:49:28.583 --> 01:49:30.000 line:82%
Slide over.

921
01:49:30.667 --> 01:49:34.208 line:82%
So, how? They won't ask
us before robbing again.

922
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.708 line:82%
Sahir's strength is his twin.
His weakness, too.

923
01:49:41.042 --> 01:49:43.833 line:82%
You're way above my head.

924
01:49:44.167 --> 01:49:45.833 line:82%
Be direct. What do we do?

925
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:26.792 line:82%
Sunday 14th May.

926
01:50:27.542 --> 01:50:30.000 line:82%
Sahir says I look like
a hip hop artist.

927
01:50:30.833 --> 01:50:31.583 line:82%
I told him:

928
01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:33.708 line:82%
"Six days a week I look like you."

929
01:50:34.375 --> 01:50:36.750 line:82%
"One day of the week I look like me."

930
01:50:38.458 --> 01:50:41.833 line:82%
Every Sunday he makes some excuse
asking me not to go out.

931
01:50:43.167 --> 01:50:45.208 line:82%
I know why he says that.

932
01:50:45.708 --> 01:50:48.875 line:82%
Because it scares him when
I go out alone.

933
01:50:49.833 --> 01:50:51.167 line:82%
No problem for me.

934
01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:52.833 line:82%
I can look after myself.

935
01:50:53.292 --> 01:50:56.042 line:82%
The truth? I have great fun.

936
01:50:56.708 --> 01:50:58.792 line:82%
I live in that box for days.

937
01:50:59.083 --> 01:51:02.500 line:82%
Only on Sundays do I feel the air
caress my face.

938
01:51:03.625 --> 01:51:06.458 line:82%
My nose turns cold as ice.

939
01:51:07.125 --> 01:51:08.083 line:82%
Love it.

940
01:51:11.208 --> 01:51:12.792 line:82%
Love scrawling my name.

941
01:51:13.542 --> 01:51:14.542 line:82%
My name.

942
01:51:15.250 --> 01:51:16.958 line:82%
Only my name.

943
01:51:17.292 --> 01:51:19.083 line:82%
SAMAR.

944
01:51:19.667 --> 01:51:23.167 line:82%
For two minutes I tell the world
my secret.

945
01:51:25.083 --> 01:51:28.042 line:82%
Then the secret vanishes,
all on its own.

946
01:51:28.917 --> 01:51:30.250 line:82%
Just like me.

947
01:51:48.792 --> 01:51:51.250 line:82%
- Two burgers. One Mountain Dew.
- Yes, sir.

948
01:51:53.083 --> 01:51:54.625 line:82%
8$ 20.

949
01:52:08.667 --> 01:52:11.625 line:82%
Thief, thief! Stop!
Stop that thief.

950
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:31.958 line:82%
Hey you Indian, come back.

951
01:52:32.250 --> 01:52:33.958 line:82%
I'll kill you.

952
01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:38.333 line:82%
I'll kill you.

953
01:52:39.917 --> 01:52:40.958 line:82%
Excuse me, please.

954
01:52:41.167 --> 01:52:44.042 line:82%
You see Indian thief? Tall chap?
This much, you see him?

955
01:52:44.375 --> 01:52:46.208 line:82%
I kill him with this.

956
01:52:47.083 --> 01:52:47.792 line:82%
Thank you.

957
01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.125 line:82%
I kill you, I kill you.

958
01:52:53.208 --> 01:52:57.833 line:82%
I no kill you. I kill Indian. Coming,
taking your phone number.

959
01:52:58.083 --> 01:52:59.208 line:82%
Thank you.

960
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.625 line:82%
Stealing? Very bad.

961
01:53:12.875 --> 01:53:14.167 line:82%
I'm not a thief.

962
01:53:15.917 --> 01:53:19.458 line:82%
If you don't eat for 4 days, your
sense of morality vanishes.

963
01:53:22.667 --> 01:53:25.708 line:82%
Happy Burger! Makes you happy
if you eat it.

964
01:53:39.917 --> 01:53:41.917 line:82%
Know who the real big thieves are?

965
01:53:43.417 --> 01:53:44.417 line:82%
The banks.

966
01:53:47.208 --> 01:53:49.917 line:82%
They can ruin a man in a matter
of days.

967
01:53:50.958 --> 01:53:52.708 line:82%
Everyone steals.

968
01:53:54.167 --> 01:53:56.833 line:82%
But you must find something
worth stealing.

969
01:53:57.542 --> 01:53:58.625 line:82%
What do you steal?

970
01:54:06.625 --> 01:54:07.583 line:82%
Fun!

971
01:54:56.625 --> 01:54:58.750 line:82%
Terrific ride. But there's one
even better.

972
01:54:59.042 --> 01:55:01.000 line:82%
- Which one?
- Raging Bull.

973
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000 line:82%
Let's go.

974
01:55:07.917 --> 01:55:08.917 line:82%
Where are you going?

975
01:55:09.167 --> 01:55:11.958 line:82%
I come here every Sunday
from 11.45 to 3.

976
01:55:12.625 --> 01:55:14.542 line:82%
Can't miss the bus home.

977
01:55:18.583 --> 01:55:22.042 line:82%
See you next Sunday? Same time?
We'll steal some fun.

978
01:55:24.208 --> 01:55:26.500 line:82%
The Great Indian Circus.
Great fun.

979
01:55:29.417 --> 01:55:30.542 line:82%
Thanks, my friend.

980
01:55:33.208 --> 01:55:35.958 line:82%
I've never had any friends.

981
01:55:36.958 --> 01:55:38.625 line:82%
Neither have I.

982
01:55:39.958 --> 01:55:40.792 line:82%
Good.

983
01:55:42.708 --> 01:55:43.500 line:82%
Good.

984
01:55:48.167 --> 01:55:49.000 line:82%
See you.

985
01:55:54.042 --> 01:55:57.083 line:82%
Papa, I thought I didn't know
how to make friends.

986
01:55:57.542 --> 01:56:02.875 line:82%
But friendship isn't maths.
No rules like maths.

987
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.417 line:82%
My first friend.

988
01:56:05.833 --> 01:56:09.208 line:82%
I felt like telling Sahir.
But he won't like it.

989
01:56:10.083 --> 01:56:12.417 line:82%
He has no time for friendship.

990
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:15.917 line:82%
Some things are best left a secret.

991
01:56:17.125 --> 01:56:19.583 line:82%
I have two secrets now.

992
01:56:20.958 --> 01:56:22.042 line:82%
Aliya.

993
01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:23.833 line:82%
And my friend.

994
01:56:24.458 --> 01:56:26.167 line:82%
FRIEND.

995
01:56:39.083 --> 01:56:42.583 line:82%
That's real brains.
Brains in Hindi is...?

996
01:56:43.708 --> 01:56:44.583 line:82%
That's real brains.

997
01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:48.542 line:82%
God gave me movie star looks.

998
01:56:48.875 --> 01:56:52.458 line:82%
And gave Jai brains as sharp
as Karim's razor.

999
01:56:53.125 --> 01:56:56.458 line:82%
Karim? Who? He bleaches
my face, cuts my hair.

1000
01:56:57.542 --> 01:56:59.750 line:82%
You think she's researching
your life?

1001
01:57:00.125 --> 01:57:02.167 line:82%
I'm researching hers.

1002
01:57:02.542 --> 01:57:05.958 line:82%
I have her horoscope. Native place,
beauty parlour, the lot.

1003
01:57:06.375 --> 01:57:10.250 line:82%
You're here to catch a thief.
Do your job. Got it?

1004
01:57:11.417 --> 01:57:14.875 line:82%
This is the list of things
I need to know.

1005
01:57:15.125 --> 01:57:16.792 line:82%
Sahir and the Great Indian Circus.

1006
01:57:17.042 --> 01:57:18.542 line:82%
Think you can find out for me?

1007
01:57:18.958 --> 01:57:19.833 line:82%
I'll get on it.

1008
01:57:20.083 --> 01:57:21.792 line:82%
How will his history help us?

1009
01:57:22.042 --> 01:57:25.625 line:82%
Because it'll tell us what
Sahir plans to do next.

1010
01:57:26.042 --> 01:57:29.458 line:82%
You really won't get it.
So don't act like you do.

1011
01:57:29.958 --> 01:57:31.375 line:82%
Shall I act like she's my date?

1012
01:57:31.833 --> 01:57:34.708 line:82%
Focus on your work.
Not on the Kamasutra.

1013
01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:03.250 line:82%
- Mr.Iqbal Khan, how are you?
- I'm fine, Jennifer.

1014
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:04.750 line:82%
My locker, please.

1015
01:58:05.375 --> 01:58:07.583 line:82%
I've been well. Just my knees,
you know.

1016
01:58:08.083 --> 01:58:10.000 line:82%
This weekend my boyfriend
was playing basketball...

1017
01:58:29.917 --> 01:58:34.667 line:82%
This is for you. Here.

1018
01:58:35.083 --> 01:58:37.375 line:82%
Thank you. See you in a minute.

1019
01:59:01.083 --> 01:59:05.417 line:82%
Papa, you said as long as
I have these 25$...

1020
01:59:06.167 --> 01:59:10.083 line:82%
...no bank in the world can
shut our circus down.

1021
01:59:13.958 --> 01:59:16.125 line:82%
This is the bank's last day, Papa.

1022
01:59:19.458 --> 01:59:21.042 line:82%
The bank is about to close.

1023
01:59:23.208 --> 01:59:24.500 line:82%
Forever.

1024
01:59:55.958 --> 01:59:58.500 line:82%
Adding two and two? Eh?

1025
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.417 line:82%
Tomorrow you'll see four.

1026
02:00:11.042 --> 02:00:12.625 line:82%
His Highness the Great.

1027
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.250 line:82%
The burger thief?

1028
02:00:15.833 --> 02:00:18.583 line:82%
I found myself a job.
Today it's my treat.

1029
02:00:19.875 --> 02:00:21.375 line:82%
I saw your circus act.

1030
02:00:21.625 --> 02:00:22.792 line:82%
Too good.

1031
02:00:23.083 --> 02:00:25.667 line:82%
I want your autograph.
And a photograph.

1032
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.458 line:82%
I clapped like crazy at the end.
But you didn't see me.

1033
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000 line:82%
Forget me. You didn't even notice
your girlfriend Aliya.

1034
02:00:33.458 --> 02:00:35.042 line:82%
The Wonder Girl.

1035
02:00:36.958 --> 02:00:38.917 line:82%
She isn't my GF.

1036
02:00:39.875 --> 02:00:41.792 line:82%
Aliya isn't your GF?

1037
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:44.417 line:82%
Why not?

1038
02:00:45.167 --> 02:00:47.875 line:82%
What makes you think
she's my girlfriend?

1039
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.708 line:82%
I have very sharp eyes.

1040
02:00:51.125 --> 02:00:53.375 line:82%
I read minds at a glance.

1041
02:00:53.792 --> 02:00:58.417 line:82%
The way she looked at you only
a GF looks at her BF like that.

1042
02:00:59.167 --> 02:01:01.167 line:82%
Thought she'd kiss you.

1043
02:01:02.042 --> 02:01:03.417 line:82%
She's not that kind.

1044
02:01:05.083 --> 02:01:06.792 line:82%
You know nothing.

1045
02:01:07.167 --> 02:01:08.167 line:82%
Stupid.

1046
02:01:34.333 --> 02:01:37.833 line:82%
- Makes you happy...
- I know.

1047
02:01:46.250 --> 02:01:48.500 line:82%
I love her.

1048
02:01:53.167 --> 02:01:54.833 line:82%
So? I was spot on.

1049
02:01:55.917 --> 02:01:58.167 line:82%
But she isn't my GF.

1050
02:01:59.917 --> 02:02:03.375 line:82%
She doesn't even know
that I like her.

1051
02:02:04.875 --> 02:02:06.875 line:82%
Impossible, my friend.

1052
02:02:09.417 --> 02:02:12.000 line:82%
When you stand near her
and hold her hand...

1053
02:02:12.292 --> 02:02:14.000 line:82%
Know how she looks at you?

1054
02:02:14.208 --> 02:02:17.708 line:82%
The way Laila looks at her
beloved Majnu.

1055
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.083 line:82%
When you dance with her...

1056
02:02:21.417 --> 02:02:22.875 line:82%
...she looks at you the way...

1057
02:02:23.167 --> 02:02:24.958 line:82%
...Angelina looks at Brad.

1058
02:02:26.250 --> 02:02:28.583 line:82%
When she stands close to you...

1059
02:02:29.542 --> 02:02:30.917 line:82%
...know how she looks?

1060
02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:32.708 line:82%
The way Aliya looks at Sahir.

1061
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:34.625 line:82%
Yes!

1062
02:02:35.292 --> 02:02:38.042 line:82%
She sees no one but Sahir.

1063
02:02:42.875 --> 02:02:44.458 line:82%
She looks the way...

1064
02:02:45.167 --> 02:02:47.792 line:82%
...Aliya looks at Sahir.

1065
02:02:48.458 --> 02:02:50.375 line:82%
See? I knew it.

1066
02:02:51.708 --> 02:02:54.208 line:82%
Sees no one but Sahir.

1067
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:58.167 line:82%
The way Aliya looks at Sahir...

1068
02:03:00.125 --> 02:03:06.375 line:82%
But Samar sees only Aliya.

1069
02:03:33.208 --> 02:03:36.833 line:82%
I'm doing your act today.

1070
02:03:37.917 --> 02:03:41.125 line:82%
You will take my place
and I'll take yours.

1071
02:03:41.792 --> 02:03:43.292 line:82%
Are you crazy?

1072
02:03:43.708 --> 02:03:45.750 line:82%
Want the circus to close down?

1073
02:03:46.792 --> 02:03:48.000 line:82%
Why say that?

1074
02:03:48.625 --> 02:03:50.375 line:82%
Why? Don't you know why?

1075
02:03:50.667 --> 02:03:53.750 line:82%
That's our trick. The world sees one,
but we're two.

1076
02:03:54.208 --> 02:03:57.500 line:82%
As if anyone would find out.

1077
02:03:59.000 --> 02:03:59.875 line:82%
No.

1078
02:04:01.042 --> 02:04:02.500 line:82%
I'm doing it.

1079
02:04:03.167 --> 02:04:05.167 line:82%
You can't. We haven't rehearsed.

1080
02:04:05.583 --> 02:04:07.458 line:82%
Don't need to.

1081
02:04:09.083 --> 02:04:12.792 line:82%
I'm always Sahir. Today see what
being Samar is like.

1082
02:04:13.917 --> 02:04:16.625 line:82%
- Stop it! You can't do it.
- Sure I can.

1083
02:04:17.792 --> 02:04:19.542 line:82%
We swap places today.

1084
02:04:26.542 --> 02:04:28.500 line:82%
5 minutes. And you're on.

1085
02:04:34.417 --> 02:04:35.458 line:82%
All right.

1086
02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:37.583 line:82%
You're Sahir today.

1087
02:04:39.208 --> 02:04:40.125 line:82%
I'm Samar.

1088
02:04:42.625 --> 02:04:43.792 line:82%
For the first...

1089
02:04:44.583 --> 02:04:45.583 line:82%
...and the last time.

1090
02:05:02.917 --> 02:05:06.000 line:82%
People of God are we.
Who can defy us?

1091
02:05:06.250 --> 02:05:08.708 line:82%
I'd never forget Papa's words.
No need reminding me.

1092
02:06:52.708 --> 02:06:54.292 line:82%
You're totally crazy, boss.

1093
02:06:54.875 --> 02:06:56.125 line:82%
Always have been.

1094
02:07:12.583 --> 02:07:14.667 line:82%
I thought it was just me.

1095
02:07:15.167 --> 02:07:17.542 line:82%
But I think you were flirting too.

1096
02:07:19.375 --> 02:07:21.167 line:82%
I love this "flirting" term.

1097
02:07:21.625 --> 02:07:26.875 line:82%
Something happened today.
No! A lot happened.

1098
02:07:27.708 --> 02:07:31.375 line:82%
Something electric flowed
between us.

1099
02:07:36.833 --> 02:07:38.500 line:82%
I can still feel it.

1100
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:41.208 line:82%
Well?

1101
02:07:43.292 --> 02:07:45.417 line:82%
What do we do about
this electricity?

1102
02:07:46.667 --> 02:07:47.708 line:82%
What do we do?

1103
02:07:48.125 --> 02:07:52.458 line:82%
When some things happen in life,
you can't let them pass.

1104
02:07:53.125 --> 02:07:56.292 line:82%
Everything has its moment.
It's all timing.

1105
02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.292 line:82%
One second late.

1106
02:07:58.917 --> 02:08:00.083 line:82%
It's all over.

1107
02:08:01.625 --> 02:08:02.875 line:82%
If I walk away, all shy.

1108
02:08:03.125 --> 02:08:06.167 line:82%
A year later, I'm throwing petals
on your wedding day.

1109
02:08:07.167 --> 02:08:10.167 line:82%
Blaming my bad luck. If only I had
spoken out.

1110
02:08:10.625 --> 02:08:14.125 line:82%
If only I had said something.
If only, if only.

1111
02:08:14.833 --> 02:08:18.042 line:82%
I'm not an "if only" person.

1112
02:08:21.875 --> 02:08:22.875 line:82%
How about a date?

1113
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.958 line:82%
- You and me.
- OK.

1114
02:08:30.708 --> 02:08:31.875 line:82%
- Ten minutes?
- OK.

1115
02:08:32.083 --> 02:08:33.292 line:82%
At the gate.

1116
02:08:59.083 --> 02:09:00.792 line:82%
Going somewhere?

1117
02:09:01.875 --> 02:09:03.542 line:82%
It's not Sunday.

1118
02:09:05.083 --> 02:09:06.875 line:82%
I have a date.

1119
02:09:08.292 --> 02:09:09.583 line:82%
With Aliya.

1120
02:09:14.917 --> 02:09:15.833 line:82%
Aliya.

1121
02:09:20.042 --> 02:09:22.917 line:82%
So you like her?

1122
02:09:24.833 --> 02:09:26.833 line:82%
Does she like you?

1123
02:09:29.625 --> 02:09:31.833 line:82%
But who does she really like?

1124
02:09:33.125 --> 02:09:37.458 line:82%
- Me, of course
- Yes? Like all the others...

1125
02:09:38.625 --> 02:09:40.792 line:82%
...she knows only me.

1126
02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:45.250 line:82%
- Why didn't she speak before?
- Never gave her the chance.

1127
02:09:49.083 --> 02:09:51.917 line:82%
We're this close to our goal.
This close.

1128
02:09:52.667 --> 02:09:55.583 line:82%
We're winning, the bank's losing
because we're two.

1129
02:09:56.458 --> 02:09:58.042 line:82%
Papa's secret.

1130
02:09:58.833 --> 02:10:01.000 line:82%
Our lives have a purpose.

1131
02:10:01.542 --> 02:10:05.917 line:82%
So don't do anything to
threaten that purpose.

1132
02:10:11.583 --> 02:10:14.667 line:82%
She'll feel bad if I don't show up.

1133
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:17.750 line:82%
I'll feel bad too.

1134
02:10:19.083 --> 02:10:21.125 line:82%
It's just one evening.

1135
02:10:21.583 --> 02:10:23.167 line:82%
I'm not a kid anymore.

1136
02:10:27.167 --> 02:10:28.750 line:82%
What did you imagine?

1137
02:10:29.583 --> 02:10:32.000 line:82%
You see her and she'll fall
head over heels for you?

1138
02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:34.000 line:82%
How?

1139
02:10:34.542 --> 02:10:37.000 line:82%
How will you talk to her?
Stammer away?

1140
02:10:37.458 --> 02:10:39.875 line:82%
You'll get all tongue-tied.

1141
02:10:41.625 --> 02:10:44.250 line:82%
You're a secret. Hidden in
that box for good reason.

1142
02:10:44.667 --> 02:10:46.625 line:82%
Because you're weak.

1143
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.000 line:82%
We've always protected you.
First Papa. Then me.

1144
02:10:53.917 --> 02:10:58.000 line:82%
Never faced the world. That's
why you're inside and I'm out.

1145
02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:01.625 line:82%
On the stage we can pass as one.
Not in the real world.

1146
02:11:03.292 --> 02:11:07.083 line:82%
In two minutes, she'll realise
you're not Sahir.

1147
02:11:08.292 --> 02:11:12.208 line:82%
Stick that in your skull
till it totally sinks in.

1148
02:11:14.208 --> 02:11:17.250 line:82%
You're my shadow. Stay that way.
You bloody idiot.

1149
02:11:30.542 --> 02:11:32.125 line:82%
I'm not a shadow.

1150
02:11:32.625 --> 02:11:34.000 line:82%
I'm Samar.

1151
02:11:38.917 --> 02:11:41.708 line:82%
I'm not weak. I'm Samar.

1152
02:11:45.083 --> 02:11:46.833 line:82%
Papa's two hands.

1153
02:11:47.208 --> 02:11:48.875 line:82%
Sahir and Samar.

1154
02:11:50.458 --> 02:11:53.625 line:82%
You get all the praise for my act.

1155
02:11:54.708 --> 02:11:56.875 line:82%
My ideas. Applause for you.

1156
02:11:57.208 --> 02:12:00.667 line:82%
Now you're the mastermind
and I'm the threat?

1157
02:12:05.667 --> 02:12:08.417 line:82%
We have the same face.
But we have two minds.

1158
02:12:08.958 --> 02:12:10.250 line:82%
Two hearts.

1159
02:12:12.292 --> 02:12:15.083 line:82%
You want me to obey your
every command.

1160
02:12:16.125 --> 02:12:20.250 line:82%
I must want what you want.
Feel what you feel. Why?

1161
02:12:21.250 --> 02:12:22.417 line:82%
Why always me?

1162
02:12:25.375 --> 02:12:28.250 line:82%
You be my shadow. Rot in that box.
You're weak.

1163
02:13:35.917 --> 02:13:38.000 line:82%
Sorry. Date cancelled.

1164
02:13:41.417 --> 02:13:42.000 line:82%
Why?

1165
02:13:42.708 --> 02:13:44.917 line:82%
Don't date boys with untied
shoelaces.

1166
02:13:49.917 --> 02:13:50.708 line:82%
Come on.

1167
02:13:52.167 --> 02:13:53.917 line:82%
What if I told you...

1168
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:56.583 line:82%
...I don't know how to tie them.

1169
02:13:57.792 --> 02:13:59.250 line:82%
Sweet trick!

1170
02:13:59.917 --> 02:14:02.750 line:82%
Girl at your feet on the very
first date.

1171
02:14:03.792 --> 02:14:05.167 line:82%
I like it.

1172
02:14:06.250 --> 02:14:07.167 line:82%
Albert Einstein.

1173
02:14:08.833 --> 02:14:10.792 line:82%
He couldn't tie his shoelaces either.

1174
02:14:11.417 --> 02:14:12.167 line:82%
It's a fact.

1175
02:14:13.333 --> 02:14:16.042 line:82%
Mr. Einstein of the circus.

1176
02:14:16.875 --> 02:14:19.042 line:82%
The man who knows every trick
in the book.

1177
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.042 line:82%
Except this.

1178
02:14:23.125 --> 02:14:24.875 line:82%
It's kind of cute.

1179
02:14:25.917 --> 02:14:27.292 line:82%
Almost sexy.

1180
02:14:36.583 --> 02:14:38.458 line:82%
I can't brush my teeth with
my right hand.

1181
02:14:38.792 --> 02:14:39.792 line:82%
So what am I?

1182
02:14:45.167 --> 02:14:46.125 line:82%
What is it?

1183
02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:49.375 line:82%
Electricity.

1184
02:14:52.583 --> 02:14:55.125 line:82%
- So where are we going?
- I don't know.

1185
02:14:57.042 --> 02:15:01.750 line:82%
A dead ringer just walked by
with a sexy babe in tow.

1186
02:15:02.083 --> 02:15:02.875 line:82%
Follow them.

1187
02:15:03.125 --> 02:15:04.667 line:82%
Roger. Over and out.

1188
02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:06.000 line:82%
What?

1189
02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:08.667 line:82%
Since I got here...

1190
02:15:08.958 --> 02:15:11.208 line:82%
I've been dying to say:
"Over and out."

1191
02:15:11.583 --> 02:15:13.417 line:82%
Never had the chance.

1192
02:15:14.042 --> 02:15:15.250 line:82%
- Ali.
- Yes.

1193
02:15:15.708 --> 02:15:16.375 line:82%
Buzz off!

1194
02:15:16.750 --> 02:15:19.250 line:82%
Buzzing off. Let's buzz.

1195
02:15:20.583 --> 02:15:21.417 line:82%
Gentlemen.

1196
02:15:21.875 --> 02:15:24.708 line:82%
Thank you for coming at short notice
for this emergency meeting.

1197
02:15:25.542 --> 02:15:27.750 line:82%
Whatever it is, it had better be good.

1198
02:15:28.083 --> 02:15:30.167 line:82%
I don't have much time.
Time is money.

1199
02:15:30.625 --> 02:15:33.208 line:82%
Absolutely right, Mr. Anderson.
You don't have much time.

1200
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:36.667 line:82%
And if you don't be quiet, soon you
won't have any money either.

1201
02:15:39.417 --> 02:15:42.708 line:82%
The Western Bank of Chicago
is being robbed for a reason.

1202
02:15:43.208 --> 02:15:45.250 line:82%
That reason is the Great
Indian Circus.

1203
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.583 line:82%
Sahir Khan, the owner of the circus,
is Iqbal Haroon Khan's son.

1204
02:15:51.667 --> 02:15:53.000 line:82%
A gentleman who 25 years ago...

1205
02:15:53.250 --> 02:15:56.000 line:82%
...took his life because of you
and your bank, Mr. Anderson.

1206
02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:57.542 line:82%
What's your point?

1207
02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.875 line:82%
My point isn't for you.
It's for the Chicago Police.

1208
02:16:02.375 --> 02:16:03.250 line:82%
What do you need?

1209
02:16:04.583 --> 02:16:08.417 line:82%
Cooperation. I'm bringing him in.
Tonight.

1210
02:16:14.292 --> 02:16:15.125 line:82%
You cheated.

1211
02:16:25.125 --> 02:16:26.458 line:82%
What is it?

1212
02:16:32.042 --> 02:16:34.083 line:82%
When you're in a crowd...

1213
02:16:34.708 --> 02:16:36.625 line:82%
...you're the only one I see.

1214
02:16:38.792 --> 02:16:40.750 line:82%
Now there's only you.

1215
02:16:41.292 --> 02:16:44.083 line:82%
And I don't know how
to look at you.

1216
02:16:45.125 --> 02:16:46.292 line:82%
Careful, boss.

1217
02:16:46.667 --> 02:16:49.833 line:82%
Talk like that and people will think
you're my boyfriend.

1218
02:16:50.458 --> 02:16:51.875 line:82%
Let them.

1219
02:16:54.083 --> 02:16:56.167 line:82%
So which one is my boyfriend?

1220
02:16:58.042 --> 02:16:59.250 line:82%
You really are two people.

1221
02:16:59.750 --> 02:17:00.833 line:82%
You know that, right?

1222
02:17:03.875 --> 02:17:05.708 line:82%
One is my boss.

1223
02:17:06.458 --> 02:17:09.917 line:82%
Nice, but has a big ego.

1224
02:17:11.208 --> 02:17:13.750 line:82%
He always ignores me.

1225
02:17:16.042 --> 02:17:17.292 line:82%
And there's you.

1226
02:17:17.958 --> 02:17:20.500 line:82%
When you look at me, I feel...

1227
02:17:22.042 --> 02:17:24.250 line:82%
...as though I'm the answer
to every question.

1228
02:17:26.042 --> 02:17:27.667 line:82%
Like I'm the rain.

1229
02:17:28.167 --> 02:17:30.583 line:82%
Falling only for you.

1230
02:17:33.417 --> 02:17:35.333 line:82%
You look at me...

1231
02:17:37.792 --> 02:17:39.458 line:82%
The way you're looking now.

1232
02:17:42.250 --> 02:17:43.250 line:82%
Tell me.

1233
02:17:44.292 --> 02:17:45.458 line:82%
Which me...

1234
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:47.958 line:82%
...do you like?

1235
02:17:50.917 --> 02:17:52.875 line:82%
You're my affliction.

1236
02:17:54.458 --> 02:17:55.875 line:82%
You're my cure.

1237
02:17:58.042 --> 02:17:59.583 line:82%
You're my affliction.

1238
02:18:01.417 --> 02:18:02.292 line:82%
You're my cure.

1239
02:18:17.083 --> 02:18:18.125 line:82%
This one.

1240
02:18:48.875 --> 02:18:49.833 line:82%
Good evening, sir.

1241
02:18:50.083 --> 02:18:54.042 line:82%
Sorry, the park is closing in 5 minutes.
Hope you had a great day here.

1242
02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:05.000 line:82%
You're my best friend.

1243
02:19:05.958 --> 02:19:09.000 line:82%
All thanks to you, best friend.

1244
02:19:14.417 --> 02:19:16.417 line:82%
You think of me as a friend?

1245
02:19:18.167 --> 02:19:20.875 line:82%
Will you keep my secret?

1246
02:19:41.708 --> 02:19:43.833 line:82%
ACP Jai Dixit. Mumbai Police.

1247
02:19:46.125 --> 02:19:47.167 line:82%
Jai Dixit?

1248
02:19:47.583 --> 02:19:49.333 line:82%
I made friends for a reason.

1249
02:19:50.167 --> 02:19:52.208 line:82%
But I know the meaning
of friendship now.

1250
02:19:52.667 --> 02:19:54.500 line:82%
Friends don't use each other.

1251
02:19:56.708 --> 02:19:59.375 line:82%
Don't be scared. It was all a sham.

1252
02:20:00.250 --> 02:20:02.583 line:82%
The friendship wasn't.

1253
02:20:02.917 --> 02:20:04.500 line:82%
Friends don't lie.

1254
02:20:04.792 --> 02:20:06.583 line:82%
Samar, I'm here to help you.

1255
02:20:06.833 --> 02:20:08.125 line:82%
You lied to me.

1256
02:20:09.958 --> 02:20:15.667 line:82%
The bank wronged your father.
They've been punished enough.

1257
02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:18.792 line:82%
They've lost all face. Their shares
have plummeted.

1258
02:20:19.042 --> 02:20:20.083 line:82%
They're bust.

1259
02:20:20.417 --> 02:20:21.750 line:82%
But it's still around.

1260
02:20:22.208 --> 02:20:23.208 line:82%
Papa isn't.

1261
02:20:23.917 --> 02:20:26.375 line:82%
Forgiveness is better than revenge.

1262
02:20:27.125 --> 02:20:29.208 line:82%
You've had your revenge.

1263
02:20:29.667 --> 02:20:31.417 line:82%
Time to stop your fight.

1264
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:33.917 line:82%
You lied to me.

1265
02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:36.750 line:82%
I know you and Sahir are twins.

1266
02:20:40.083 --> 02:20:43.125 line:82%
You're the secret of Sahir's
great circus.

1267
02:20:45.667 --> 02:20:48.458 line:82%
The police know you pulled off
the heists together.

1268
02:20:51.208 --> 02:20:54.042 line:82%
You know our secret? Not good.

1269
02:20:57.375 --> 02:20:58.625 line:82%
You're my friend.

1270
02:20:59.125 --> 02:21:00.667 line:82%
I'm here for you.

1271
02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.833 line:82%
But you must help me.

1272
02:21:03.375 --> 02:21:06.875 line:82%
Come with me. Give a statement
to the police. Turn yourself in.

1273
02:21:07.458 --> 02:21:08.375 line:82%
Trust me.

1274
02:21:08.708 --> 02:21:10.875 line:82%
I'll help you both in court.

1275
02:21:11.250 --> 02:21:13.167 line:82%
We'll make an leniency plea.

1276
02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:14.583 line:82%
No.

1277
02:21:14.917 --> 02:21:16.917 line:82%
Samar, you've no option.

1278
02:21:17.458 --> 02:21:20.000 line:82%
I'm asking you because Sahir
won't listen to me.

1279
02:21:20.375 --> 02:21:22.000 line:82%
He won't stop his mission.

1280
02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.625 line:82%
Do you know how this ends?
In death.

1281
02:21:27.958 --> 02:21:29.917 line:82%
Only you can save the situation.

1282
02:21:30.208 --> 02:21:33.333 line:82%
Save your brother. Save yourself.
And Aliya's love.

1283
02:21:35.542 --> 02:21:37.417 line:82%
Trust me. There's no way out.

1284
02:21:39.542 --> 02:21:42.500 line:82%
I'm your friend. Please trust me.

1285
02:22:16.375 --> 02:22:21.542 line:82%
You're like a bad cold
one can't shake.

1286
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.500 line:82%
Sahir the Wizard.

1287
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:29.792 line:82%
I'm a circus man. We don't
only fool the eye...

1288
02:22:30.417 --> 02:22:33.125 line:82%
...but death too. Every day.

1289
02:22:33.667 --> 02:22:35.583 line:82%
I like your trick.

1290
02:22:37.042 --> 02:22:38.458 line:82%
You're a real magician.

1291
02:22:39.708 --> 02:22:40.917 line:82%
Guile.

1292
02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.250 line:82%
Invention.

1293
02:22:43.917 --> 02:22:45.250 line:82%
And deception.

1294
02:22:45.833 --> 02:22:48.458 line:82%
Put them together and that's
magic for you.

1295
02:24:17.708 --> 02:24:21.208 line:82%
So a cop and thief can only
be enemies? Right, Mr.Dixit?

1296
02:24:21.708 --> 02:24:23.417 line:82%
Making a mistake.

1297
02:24:24.292 --> 02:24:25.750 line:82%
I can help you.

1298
02:24:29.417 --> 02:24:31.375 line:82%
It was never your fight, Jai.

1299
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:34.083 line:82%
I gave you the chance to
go back to India.

1300
02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:36.500 line:82%
But you...

1301
02:24:37.417 --> 02:24:39.042 line:82%
...you conned us.

1302
02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:41.958 line:82%
Samar is innocent, weak.

1303
02:24:42.167 --> 02:24:44.042 line:82%
You're weak without him.

1304
02:24:48.792 --> 02:24:51.042 line:82%
You're right.

1305
02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:56.042 line:82%
But you weren't right by Samar.

1306
02:24:57.208 --> 02:24:59.000 line:82%
Played with his feelings.

1307
02:24:59.708 --> 02:25:01.125 line:82%
Used him.

1308
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.583 line:82%
They say think good thoughts
before dying.

1309
02:25:09.458 --> 02:25:13.000 line:82%
So remember your few good deeds.

1310
02:25:17.667 --> 02:25:19.708 line:82%
I'd happily watch you die.

1311
02:25:20.208 --> 02:25:21.292 line:82%
But...

1312
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.792 line:82%
I have a bank to wipe out.

1313
02:25:27.167 --> 02:25:28.208 line:82%
Enjoy the ride.

1314
02:25:47.792 --> 02:25:49.833 line:82%
It's all about timing, brother.

1315
02:26:16.542 --> 02:26:17.792 line:82%
22nd May.

1316
02:26:18.417 --> 02:26:22.042 line:82%
The most important and dangerous
day of our lives.

1317
02:26:29.833 --> 02:26:33.792 line:82%
The storm that shook our souls...

1318
02:26:34.625 --> 02:26:37.167 line:82%
...will smile and still itself.

1319
02:26:44.625 --> 02:26:48.750 line:82%
Today we wrap the bank in a shroud.

1320
02:26:50.125 --> 02:26:54.000 line:82%
Today the Western Bank of Chicago
gets buried.

1321
02:26:58.542 --> 02:27:01.667 line:82%
WESTERN BANK OF CHICAGO.

1322
02:27:15.667 --> 02:27:16.583 line:82%
Move!

1323
02:27:16.875 --> 02:27:18.792 line:82%
Take your positions.

1324
02:27:32.583 --> 02:27:33.167 line:82%
Go, go.

1325
02:28:03.583 --> 02:28:06.250 line:82%
Gas! Get everybody out.
Go!

1326
02:28:19.958 --> 02:28:20.833 line:82%
Come on.

1327
02:28:31.417 --> 02:28:32.583 line:82%
Come on. Go!

1328
02:28:35.250 --> 02:28:36.000 line:82%
Damn it!

1329
02:29:52.875 --> 02:29:53.833 line:82%
Samar, ready?

1330
02:29:54.292 --> 02:29:55.167 line:82%
Always.

1331
02:32:04.417 --> 02:32:07.708 line:82%
Thank you, Mummy.
Spotted us from heaven?

1332
02:32:08.667 --> 02:32:09.792 line:82%
Let's go.

1333
02:36:08.875 --> 02:36:11.375 line:82%
Never caught a thief by moonlight.

1334
02:36:15.083 --> 02:36:18.875 line:82%
If I wasn't a cop, I'd write a poem
right now.

1335
02:36:19.208 --> 02:36:22.042 line:82%
I can think of one. May I?

1336
02:36:25.833 --> 02:36:26.417 line:82%
Next time.

1337
02:37:08.625 --> 02:37:12.583 line:82%
Got a poem for this situation, too.
May I?

1338
02:37:15.625 --> 02:37:17.125 line:82%
Forget them!

1339
02:37:17.542 --> 02:37:19.542 line:82%
Can't catch them. Confirmed.

1340
02:37:21.250 --> 02:37:23.083 line:82%
The night belongs to thieves.

1341
02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.167 line:82%
Let him run.

1342
02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.125 line:82%
The morning belongs to us.

1343
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:30.042 line:82%
How? He always has a new card
up his sleeve.

1344
02:37:30.458 --> 02:37:32.083 line:82%
But I hold an ace.

1345
02:37:35.417 --> 02:37:39.167 line:82%
I need choppers and a SWAT team
at sunrise.

1346
02:38:11.083 --> 02:38:11.750 line:82%
Samar.

1347
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:33.583 line:82%
We'll find a way.

1348
02:38:34.167 --> 02:38:35.042 line:82%
Samar, let's go.

1349
02:38:37.375 --> 02:38:39.417 line:82%
She's crying.

1350
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:41.292 line:82%
It's a set-up. Come.

1351
02:39:16.875 --> 02:39:17.792 line:82%
Sahir.

1352
02:39:19.833 --> 02:39:20.958 line:82%
It's over.

1353
02:40:13.458 --> 02:40:15.000 line:82%
Don't want to run any more, Jai.

1354
02:40:15.458 --> 02:40:17.542 line:82%
No place left to run.

1355
02:40:20.250 --> 02:40:22.042 line:82%
You can arrest me, but...

1356
02:40:22.625 --> 02:40:24.708 line:82%
...you've no proof to show in court.

1357
02:40:25.542 --> 02:40:27.000 line:82%
It'll take a lifetime to prove.

1358
02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.875 line:82%
Here's all the proof you need.

1359
02:40:31.375 --> 02:40:33.333 line:82%
How and when I pulled off the heists.

1360
02:40:33.833 --> 02:40:34.833 line:82%
Everything.

1361
02:40:35.583 --> 02:40:36.958 line:82%
Take me in.

1362
02:40:38.958 --> 02:40:40.167 line:82%
Let Samar go.

1363
02:40:40.667 --> 02:40:42.167 line:82%
The guilty must be punished.

1364
02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:43.833 line:82%
Not my brother.

1365
02:40:44.708 --> 02:40:45.667 line:82%
Not Samar.

1366
02:40:46.042 --> 02:40:47.542 line:82%
It was all me, Jai.

1367
02:40:47.917 --> 02:40:50.042 line:82%
All my planning. I did everything.

1368
02:40:50.875 --> 02:40:53.542 line:82%
You have the thief.
What more do you want?

1369
02:40:55.458 --> 02:40:58.750 line:82%
Samar is innocent...
let him go.

1370
02:41:02.667 --> 02:41:03.292 line:82%
Come on, Jai.

1371
02:41:03.625 --> 02:41:04.708 line:82%
It's a good deal.

1372
02:41:13.375 --> 02:41:14.292 line:82%
It's a deal.

1373
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:15.708 line:82%
You promise?

1374
02:41:56.042 --> 02:41:58.708 line:82%
You don't need to pretend
you're Sahir anymore.

1375
02:42:01.542 --> 02:42:04.375 line:82%
You're not a shadow now.
You're Samar.

1376
02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:09.750 line:82%
You're not weak. You're Samar.

1377
02:42:12.250 --> 02:42:13.625 line:82%
Time for hiding is over.

1378
02:42:14.125 --> 02:42:16.792 line:82%
Time you live and dream.

1379
02:42:20.083 --> 02:42:21.583 line:82%
We were two.

1380
02:42:22.125 --> 02:42:23.250 line:82%
We lived as one.

1381
02:42:25.083 --> 02:42:28.417 line:82%
One will live now...
for us two.

1382
02:42:45.667 --> 02:42:47.167 line:82%
Where to?

1383
02:42:48.208 --> 02:42:49.000 line:82%
Let go!

1384
02:42:51.167 --> 02:42:53.083 line:82%
They can't touch you, Samar.

1385
02:42:53.583 --> 02:42:55.375 line:82%
It ends with me.

1386
02:42:55.708 --> 02:42:57.958 line:82%
You'll be with Aliya. Free.

1387
02:42:59.417 --> 02:43:00.833 line:82%
I won't let go.

1388
02:43:01.583 --> 02:43:02.542 line:82%
Let go, Samar.

1389
02:43:02.917 --> 02:43:05.375 line:82%
Papa said: "Never let go of his hand.

1390
02:43:05.667 --> 02:43:07.958 line:82%
"Never leave his side."

1391
02:43:08.417 --> 02:43:09.833 line:82%
Let go, brother.

1392
02:43:10.583 --> 02:43:11.833 line:82%
This world isn't for me.

1393
02:43:22.083 --> 02:43:23.792 line:82%
People of God are we.

1394
02:43:24.125 --> 02:43:26.458 line:82%
Who can defy us?

1395
02:43:30.875 --> 02:43:32.917 line:82%
People of God are we.

1396
02:43:33.875 --> 02:43:35.708 line:82%
Who can defy us?

1397
02:43:36.625 --> 02:43:39.708 line:82%
Basking under a thousand suns
of hope.

1398
02:43:40.292 --> 02:43:42.500 line:82%
With steely resolve.

1399
02:43:43.042 --> 02:43:44.583 line:82%
With fearless step.

1400
02:43:45.292 --> 02:43:47.167 line:82%
Today we set forth to write...

1401
02:43:47.583 --> 02:43:48.792 line:82%
...our destiny.

1402
02:44:06.167 --> 02:44:09.000 line:82%
High up in the sky.

1403
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.458 line:82%
Is our world.

1404
02:44:13.833 --> 02:44:19.958 line:82%
In its shimmering folds
is our happiness.

1405
02:44:21.458 --> 02:44:25.792 line:82%
With the moon's mesh.

1406
02:44:29.042 --> 02:44:33.500 line:82%
We'll gather the stars.

1407
02:44:36.667 --> 02:44:40.958 line:82%
This place is a place of magic.

1408
02:44:44.250 --> 02:44:48.625 line:82%
Free of all sorrow.

1409
02:44:55.667 --> 02:44:58.292 line:82%
People of God are we.

1410
02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:02.000 line:82%
Who can defy us?

1411
02:45:03.292 --> 02:45:09.125 line:82%
Basking under a thousand suns
of hope.

1412
02:45:10.542 --> 02:45:13.667 line:82%
With steely resolve.

1413
02:45:14.792 --> 02:45:16.708 line:82%
With fearless step.

1414
02:45:17.583 --> 02:45:21.458 line:82%
Today we set forth to write...

1415
02:45:22.375 --> 02:45:24.292 line:82%
...our destiny.

1416
02:45:25.292 --> 02:45:27.792 line:82%
The Western Bank of Chicago
shuts down today.

1417
02:45:28.042 --> 02:45:29.917 line:82%
Closes its doors forever.

1418
02:45:30.167 --> 02:45:31.208 line:82%
Their stocks have crashed.

1419
02:45:31.500 --> 02:45:33.875 line:82%
It's a huge disaster
for Mr.Warren Anderson.

1420
02:45:38.583 --> 02:45:41.792 line:82%
What happened? Did the robber
bring you down?

1421
02:45:42.042 --> 02:45:44.083 line:82%
- No questions.
- We need answers.

1422
02:45:45.167 --> 02:45:48.167 line:82%
The Western Bank of Chicago's
final day.

1423
02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:52.000 line:82%
It can no longer undo lives now.

1424
02:45:54.542 --> 02:45:59.750 line:82%
Some people break the law to fix
what's broken inside of them.

1425
02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:02.917 line:82%
Who knows what's right or wrong.

1426
02:46:03.667 --> 02:46:09.042 line:82%
All I can say is you have won,
Sahir and Samar.

1427
02:46:16.125 --> 02:46:19.917 line:82%
But true victory belongs to dreams,
not to revenge.

1428
02:46:20.667 --> 02:46:25.667 line:82%
And that dream will flourish forever.
Live forever.

1429
02:46:26.042 --> 02:46:28.583 line:82%
Always bringing joy.

1430
02:46:29.250 --> 02:46:31.542 line:82%
The greatest show on earth.

1431
02:46:32.167 --> 02:46:35.208 line:82%
The Great Indian Circus.
