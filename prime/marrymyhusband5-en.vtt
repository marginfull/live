00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.010 line:80%
-Yu Ji-hyuk!
-Yu Ji-hyuk!

3
00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:52.511 line:80%
-Congrats!
-Congrats!

4
00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:54.764 line:80%
-On your 100-day
-On your 100-day...

5
00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:56.182 line:80%
vacation!

6
00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:10.112 line:80%
Did you sign up for manual labor
instead of the military?

7
00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:11.530 line:80%
What's with your face?

8
00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:13.616 line:80%
I thought you renounced the world.

9
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.076 line:80%
Haven't you heard of sunscreen?

10
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.871 line:80%
Of course,
it was around before you joined too.

11
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.332 line:80%
What shall we eat now?

12
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.417 line:80%
We spent a lot of money.

13
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:26.128 line:80%
Let's buy soju and go back to school.

14
00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:27.755 line:80%
It's a good night!

15
00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:35.095 line:80%
Thank you.

16
00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.477 line:80%
What's that?

17
00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:46.690 line:80%
Go.

18
00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:49.652 line:80%
She shouldn't have drank so much.
That scared me.

19
00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:51.320 line:80%
Sorry about that!

20
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.864 line:80%
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:02.414 line:80%
Is she alone? Shall we take her?

22
00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:04.458 line:80%
She's begging for it.

23
00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:06.377 line:80%
Ignoring her wouldn't be polite.

24
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.921 line:80%
Absolutely. That wouldn't be chivalrous.

25
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.381 line:80%
Attack!

26
00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:15.052 line:80%
-Who's that?
-Who's that?

27
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.973 line:80%
Are you okay?

28
00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.266 line:80%
A pole...

29
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.559 line:80%
Sorry.

30
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.187 line:80%
Are you okay?

31
00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:28.941 line:80%
Are you alone? Are you with anyone?

32
00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:30.901 line:80%
I'm alone.

33
00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:34.989 line:80%
I'm completely alone. Seriously alone.

34
00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:41.203 line:80%
My dad passed away on March 2nd.

35
00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:42.413 line:80%
So,

36
00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:44.290 line:80%
I'm alone.

37
00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.961 line:80%
Also, my boyfriend and I broke up.

38
00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.880 line:80%
So I'm seriously alone.

39
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.050 line:80%
What about a friend?

40
00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:56.886 line:80%
I'm sure you have a friend.

41
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:01.807 line:80%
A friend...

42
00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:29.209 line:80%
People don't like me,
so I have no friends.

43
00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:36.842 line:80%
I smell alcohol.

44
00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:51.231 line:80%
What's wrong?

45
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.196 line:80%
It smells good.

46
00:03:57.947 --> 00:03:58.948 line:80%
Excuse me?

47
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.730 line:80%
EPISODE 5

48
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.662 line:80%
What do you want to know?

49
00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:52.501 line:80%
I want to know if this is beer or soju.

50
00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.629 line:80%
I have terrible vision.

51
00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:59.174 line:80%
You can tell this is beer
with your eyes shut!

52
00:04:59.258 --> 00:05:00.634 line:80%
If you can't tell that,

53
00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:03.220 line:80%
then you
probably shouldn't drink any more.

54
00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.560 line:80%
But I bought this beer.

55
00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:12.354 line:80%
Goodness.

56
00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:14.398 line:80%
Thank you.

57
00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.608 line:80%
Doesn't your forehead hurt?

58
00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:17.818 line:80%
It doesn't hurt.

59
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.949 line:80%
But I really am allowed to drink tonight.

60
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.452 line:80%
Then drink at your place.

61
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.166 line:80%
You want me to drink alone?
I'm always alone.

62
00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:41.884 line:80%
My dad passed away three months ago.

63
00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.052 line:80%
March 2nd.

64
00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:45.971 line:80%
I know, and you broke up
with your boyfriend too.

65
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:50.642 line:80%
Do you have other family?
Where's your mom? Do you have siblings?

66
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.271 line:80%
I don't have siblings.

67
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.068 line:80%
My mom left home 3,193 days ago.

68
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:02.112 line:80%
I was in middle school.

69
00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:05.282 line:80%
Also, friends--

70
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.785 line:80%
No one likes you, so you have no friends.

71
00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.162 line:80%
How did you know?

72
00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.086 line:80%
Are you a fortune teller?

73
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.385 line:80%
Here's your beer.

74
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.970 line:80%
Thank you.

75
00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.148 line:80%
Beer's the best!

76
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.498 line:80%
Actually, I do have one friend.

77
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.503 line:80%
But I can't reach her

78
00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:04.049 line:80%
when I need her
and am having a really hard time.

79
00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:06.510 line:80%
Maybe she's busy.

80
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:10.514 line:80%
I know. We have such bad timing.

81
00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:15.060 line:80%
I'm sure she wants to be with me too.

82
00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:16.311 line:80%
I'm sure she's sad.

83
00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.029 line:80%
But...

84
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.366 line:80%
I think if I was with Su-min

85
00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:33.954 line:80%
on a day like this,

86
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.957 line:80%
I'd feel like a loser.

87
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.803 line:80%
My boyfriend

88
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:52.389 line:80%
suddenly started being busy,

89
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.726 line:80%
and he said he was always tired.

90
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:01.607 line:80%
When my dad passed,

91
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.317 line:80%
he didn't even come.

92
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.279 line:80%
That's when it hit me.

93
00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:11.408 line:80%
Still, I pretended not to know.

94
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.785 line:80%
For three months at that!

95
00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:16.705 line:80%
Because...

96
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.585 line:80%
being alone

97
00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:25.214 line:80%
would only be sadder.

98
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:39.853 line:80%
So my boyfriend...

99
00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:47.277 line:80%
I noticed that he's been smiling
at Su-min a lot.

100
00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:50.781 line:80%
But that's natural.

101
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:56.286 line:80%
Su-min's nice, pretty, and cute.

102
00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:02.334 line:80%
Also, she's my only friend.

103
00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:10.092 line:80%
Do you know that feeling?

104
00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:15.347 line:80%
I'm sure Su-min's nice,

105
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.434 line:80%
pretty, and cute.

106
00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.398 line:80%
But when I stand beside her,

107
00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:28.652 line:80%
I feel so shabby.

108
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.491 line:80%
Like a big fat loser.

109
00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:39.413 line:80%
If that's how she makes you feel,
don't be her friend.

110
00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:43.208 line:80%
Who cares if she's good or bad?
You're uncomfortable.

111
00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:44.668 line:80%
Isn't she bad for you?

112
00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.928 line:80%
Do you know what it means
to not have a family?

113
00:10:00.017 --> 00:10:01.435 line:80%
Have you been on a boat?

114
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.815 line:80%
After my dad died,

115
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:10.485 line:80%
it feels like I'm on a boat every day.

116
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.825 line:80%
My feet are firmly planted,
but the boat keeps rocking.

117
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.286 line:80%
I feel anxious.

118
00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:25.792 line:80%
I want stability.

119
00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.798 line:80%
I want to step on solid land.

120
00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:38.930 line:80%
Su-min's the only one who will be my land.

121
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:44.269 line:80%
I only have her.

122
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.319 line:80%
But this is because I'm a loser. The end.

123
00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.407 line:80%
I guess that makes me a loser too.

124
00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.912 line:80%
My mom passed away 15 years ago.

125
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.580 line:80%
Exactly 5,328 days ago.

126
00:11:05.374 --> 00:11:08.377 line:80%
After some time, I got a stepmother
and a younger sibling.

127
00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:13.006 line:80%
They're good people, but I feel strange.

128
00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:14.925 line:80%
I hate it.

129
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.345 line:80%
Wow, you really are a loser.

130
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.433 line:80%
I should get a grip.

131
00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:26.520 line:80%
The real loser was right here.

132
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:31.400 line:80%
I mean, what happened to your mom is sad,

133
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:35.404 line:80%
but the fact that your dad
could start over is a good thing, right?

134
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:41.034 line:80%
My dad should've done that.

135
00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.120 line:80%
If he had...

136
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.417 line:80%
he wouldn't have died.

137
00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.676 line:80%
My dad was able to start over,
but he died too.

138
00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.511 line:80%
Don't think that way.

139
00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:07.436 line:80%
Cheers.

140
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.356 line:80%
You're so warm.

141
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:32.169 line:80%
Let's just say we're both not losers.

142
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:39.009 line:80%
Still, you're right about one thing.
My dad was happy before he died.

143
00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:46.725 line:80%
Your dad left you with a new family.

144
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:47.851 line:80%
Congratulations!

145
00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:53.815 line:80%
Congrats on having a solid friend.

146
00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.194 line:80%
No.

147
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.909 line:80%
You're able to have
a good and solid friend.

148
00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.038 line:80%
Congratulations.

Jo Dong-suk,
a reserve for the national team,

153
00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.452 line:80%
has been beaten by
an ordinary economics student.

154
00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:58.041 line:80%
Why?

155
00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:01.628 line:80%
Why are you going this far?

156
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.546 line:80%
You're a civilian!

157
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.423 line:80%
You're not a pro athlete!

158
00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.801 line:80%
You're a soldier. Let's take ten.

159
00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.052 line:80%
What?

160
00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.014 line:80%
You want to go again?

161
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.724 line:80%
I think he does.

162
00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.185 line:80%
Why did he go into economics then?

163
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.360 line:80%
I woke up,

164
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:29.406 line:80%
and I was snoring beside
an unpleasant-looking old man!

165
00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:36.204 line:80%
I was so surprised.

166
00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.458 line:80%
I hope he doesn't go to our school.

167
00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.086 line:80%
That would be so embarrassing.

168
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.504 line:80%
I hate that.

169
00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:47.799 line:80%
But he was strange too.

170
00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.843 line:80%
Why do that with a drunk girl?

171
00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.637 line:80%
-I mean...
-True.

172
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:54.806 line:80%
I need to get a grip.

173
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.434 line:80%
I'm already 23.

174
00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.768 line:80%
When will I grow up?

175
00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:08.903 line:80%
She was an upperclassman?

176
00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:16.453 line:80%
Since we're at it, can you beat Sin-u too?
For real!

177
00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.289 line:80%
-I quit judo.
-Please, I'm begging you.

178
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.540 line:80%
Well?

179
00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:24.377 line:80%
Why?

180
00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.754 line:80%
Is something wrong?

181
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.892 line:80%
I was snoring beside
an unpleasant-looking old man!

182
00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.145 line:80%
Hey.

183
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.356 line:80%
Am I an unpleasant-looking old man?

184
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.400 line:80%
Which part do you mean?

185
00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.819 line:80%
The unpleasant-looking or old man part?

186
00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.614 line:80%
Do you want me to recommend a sunscreen?

187
00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.242 line:80%
What about now?

188
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.495 line:80%
-That's good.
-Good.

189
00:17:58.578 --> 00:17:59.829 line:80%
Really nice.

190
00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.331 line:80%
-You're so pretty.
-Yeah.

191
00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:02.540 line:80%
Yeah.

192
00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:06.336 line:80%
Hey, wait! Stop!

193
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.433 line:80%
Hey.

194
00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:25.605 line:80%
You're eating well.

195
00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.483 line:80%
Here's four.

196
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.364 line:80%
I'll give you nine. Eat it all.

197
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.660 line:80%
Eat it slowly.

198
00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:41.830 line:80%
Drink some water.

199
00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.755 line:80%
You'll get fat if you eat like that.

200
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.191 line:80%
CAT SNACKS

201
00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:24.223 line:80%
Ji-hyuk. Why are you always here
during your break?

202
00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.269 line:80%
-What is it?
-What is he doing?

203
00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:32.982 line:80%
-Did his senior ask him to make something?
-His service must be tough.

204
00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:09.686 line:80%
Thinking back, I had a few chances.

205
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.737 line:80%
I didn't seize it because I didn't know.

206
00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:25.618 line:80%
Or I couldn't seize it.

207
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.832 line:80%
2011 U&K FOOD
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FOOD BRAND

208
00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:33.668 line:80%
I would like to introduce our team.

209
00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:34.961 line:80%
Yes...

210
00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:38.089 line:80%
-And if that wasn't it...
-She's a Hankuk University alum.

211
00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:39.590 line:80%
Her name's Kang Ji-won.

212
00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:41.217 line:80%
Say hello.

213
00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:46.055 line:80%
As of today, Mr. Yu Ji-hyuk
will be our general manager.

214
00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:51.227 line:80%
Ji-won graduated from Hankuk University,

215
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.896 line:80%
but she slacks in her work. Yeah.

216
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.899 line:80%
I have to pay a lot of attention to her.

217
00:21:56.983 --> 00:22:01.320 line:80%
-What happened to the proposal plan?
-You said it was due tomorrow...

218
00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:03.948 line:80%
See? What did I tell you?

219
00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:05.867 line:80%
Let's keep moving.

220
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.243 line:80%
Yeah, well...

221
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.920 line:80%
It was a chance I shouldn't seize.

222
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.773 line:80%
But it's different this time.

223
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:42.904 line:80%
APRIL 19, 2013

224
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:34.705 line:80%
I do feel better.

225
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.211 line:80%
What was that?

226
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:44.966 line:80%
What?

227
00:23:50.263 --> 00:23:51.389 line:80%
What's with that smile?

228
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:54.600 line:80%
Follow me.

229
00:24:02.275 --> 00:24:04.777 line:80%
Didn't I tell you? He's interested in you.

230
00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:07.572 line:80%
What are you saying? He has a girlfriend.

231
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:11.117 line:80%
Is that what he said?
Did he say that himself?

232
00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:12.869 line:80%
You're acting so naive.

233
00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:15.204 line:80%
What does that matter?

234
00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:17.206 line:80%
Let me tell you about men.

235
00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:19.750 line:80%
All men cheat.

236
00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:21.919 line:80%
So he has a girlfriend?

237
00:24:22.003 --> 00:24:25.548 line:80%
He could have a wife
and still like someone else! That's men!

238
00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:27.633 line:80%
Do you know what a guy's ideal type is?

239
00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:30.428 line:80%
An unfamiliar woman.

240
00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:32.263 line:80%
That's men! Okay?

241
00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:34.849 line:80%
Are all men like you?

242
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.602 line:80%
Don't be foolish.

243
00:24:37.685 --> 00:24:39.937 line:80%
That's why you're the problem.

244
00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:42.815 line:80%
Guys are playing tricks
because you look easy.

245
00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:47.528 line:80%
You wouldn't do

246
00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:50.823 line:80%
something like that, would you?

247
00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:54.327 line:80%
What?

248
00:24:57.455 --> 00:24:58.539 line:80%
Never mind.

249
00:24:58.623 --> 00:25:01.667 line:80%
I must've thought all men were like you.

250
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:04.754 line:80%
Yeah.

251
00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:08.674 line:80%
They're all like that except for me.

252
00:25:08.758 --> 00:25:09.759 line:80%
That's why I know.

253
00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:11.719 line:80%
I'm telling you to be careful.

254
00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:13.512 line:80%
-You don't even know.
-Okay.

255
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:16.182 line:80%
Ms. Kang?

256
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.560 line:80%
-Bye.
-Yeah, okay.

257
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.689 line:80%
I mean...

258
00:25:30.655 --> 00:25:33.407 line:80%
She's acting strange.

259
00:25:36.786 --> 00:25:38.287 line:80%
Strangely good.

260
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:40.915 line:80%
She's prettier too.

261
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:56.013 line:80%
This is revolutionary.

262
00:25:57.348 --> 00:25:59.183 line:80%
We didn't have this before!

263
00:25:59.267 --> 00:26:02.186 line:80%
This is what you call perks!

264
00:26:03.354 --> 00:26:06.023 line:80%
Did you see those broad shoulders!

265
00:26:06.107 --> 00:26:07.900 line:80%
His shoulders?

266
00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:10.486 line:80%
I was looking at his waist and back.

267
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.863 line:80%
I couldn't see his shoulders!

268
00:26:12.947 --> 00:26:16.117 line:80%
It'll take two days
to look at him closely.

269
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.120 line:80%
Did you see how tall he is?
He has everything!

270
00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:22.456 line:80%
-He's insanely hot!
-He's insanely hot!

271
00:26:27.878 --> 00:26:29.005 line:80%
Yes, hello.

272
00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:30.339 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

273
00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:33.843 line:80%
The finance team has raised
your stock transaction details.

274
00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:35.386 line:80%
I called to check.

275
00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:39.098 line:80%
Does it include personal accounts?

276
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:43.352 line:80%
The amount was significant,
and you don't normally buy other stocks.

277
00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:46.647 line:80%
If you want,
shall I advise against reporting it?

278
00:26:46.731 --> 00:26:48.774 line:80%
Please, thank you.

279
00:26:48.858 --> 00:26:51.819 line:80%
Don't you usually avoid unfamiliar fields?

280
00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:56.615 line:80%
That's right.

281
00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:02.705 line:80%
GENERAL MANAGER YU JI-HYUK

282
00:27:03.706 --> 00:27:05.666 line:80%
That means he knows something.

283
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.543 line:80%
Did you say it was Roijental?

284
00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:10.588 line:80%
Are you sure there's nothing special?

285
00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:12.465 line:80%
Yes, there was a sharp rise,

286
00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:15.676 line:80%
but it's still uncertain from our data.

287
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.429 line:80%
It's not a company
Ji-hyuk is affiliated with.

288
00:27:19.388 --> 00:27:21.557 line:80%
But he still hasn't sold it?

289
00:27:22.433 --> 00:27:23.851 line:80%
Let's keep an eye on it.

290
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.771 line:80%
And see if he has a borrowed-name account.

291
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.315 line:80%
Make sure he doesn't know.

292
00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:31.317 line:80%
Yes, I understand.

293
00:27:35.154 --> 00:27:37.198 line:80%
When something's changed,

294
00:27:37.281 --> 00:27:40.368 line:80%
what wasn't a problem in the past
could become one.

295
00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:52.338 line:80%
He was so sexy!

296
00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:55.383 line:80%
-I mean it, that bottom...
-He looked so tall!

297
00:27:57.426 --> 00:28:01.263 line:80%
Are we the only ones who don't care
about Mr. Yu's transformation?

298
00:28:01.347 --> 00:28:03.057 line:80%
Everyone's surprised by it.

299
00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:06.018 line:80%
That's not my type.

300
00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:10.481 line:80%
People realize their partners
aren't their type once they start dating.

301
00:28:10.564 --> 00:28:13.109 line:80%
I'm married. Getting excited is illegal.

302
00:28:15.319 --> 00:28:17.988 line:80%
Anyway, let's talk about the meal kit.

303
00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:23.911 line:80%
Green bell peppers are good nutritionally,
but there aren't many farms that sell it.

304
00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:25.204 line:80%
So...

305
00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:29.166 line:80%
About that, green bell peppers
aren't different bell peppers.

306
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.627 line:80%
They're harvested before fully ripening.

307
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.964 line:80%
-They'll supply with a purchase guarantee.
-What?

308
00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:37.174 line:80%
That's right. I just found out too.

309
00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:41.679 line:80%
I bet all you did was study in school!

310
00:28:41.762 --> 00:28:43.973 line:80%
I grew up on a farm.

311
00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:47.977 line:80%
Which means I played barefoot in the dirt
when I was a kid.

312
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:49.645 line:80%
Really?

313
00:28:52.106 --> 00:28:55.526 line:80%
We played in the dirt a lot too!

314
00:28:56.694 --> 00:28:58.279 line:80%
Wait, was it sand?

315
00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:01.615 line:80%
We played on the beach a lot.

316
00:29:03.284 --> 00:29:04.827 line:80%
This brings back memories.

317
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:09.081 line:80%
Do you remember the lady that sold
jjokja
?
We ate so much!

318
00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:11.417 line:80%
Jjokja
?

319
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.668 line:80%
Dalgona.

320
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.796 line:80%
Eating that at the beach is so good.

321
00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:19.341 line:80%
You always broke yours,
so I did it for you.

322
00:29:21.343 --> 00:29:23.971 line:80%
Please take after Ji-won for me.

323
00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:26.474 line:80%
You have no idea
how high-maintenance she is.

324
00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:29.768 line:80%
I was upset when she went to college
in Seoul,

325
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.232 line:80%
but she couldn't make any friends
and spent her time in the library.

326
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:38.402 line:80%
I kept going back and forth from Busan.

327
00:29:42.323 --> 00:29:47.495 line:80%
So did you come to Seoul to see Ms. Kang
while you went to school in Busan?

328
00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:49.830 line:80%
Yeah, every week.

329
00:29:49.914 --> 00:29:51.540 line:80%
It was so difficult for me!

330
00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:53.584 line:80%
I had classes four days a week.

331
00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:55.586 line:80%
I was in Seoul for three days once.

332
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:57.671 line:80%
Is that why she couldn't make friends?

333
00:30:00.716 --> 00:30:03.719 line:80%
That's too far even for a weekly visit
to see a guy.

334
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.763 line:80%
That's how close we were.

335
00:30:09.934 --> 00:30:13.479 line:80%
She's your other half.
Friends like that are hard to come by.

336
00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:18.651 line:80%
"Friends like that" shouldn't exist.

337
00:30:18.734 --> 00:30:22.112 line:80%
Why did you go
to school in Seoul, Ms. Kang?

338
00:30:22.196 --> 00:30:24.156 line:80%
To go to Hankuk University.

339
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.201 line:80%
You have to give it to her,
it's Hankuk University.

340
00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:32.540 line:80%
Are you here to have fun?

341
00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:38.212 line:80%
You should be working,
but you're all here chatting away.

342
00:30:38.879 --> 00:30:41.423 line:80%
Hey, Hankuk University. Go move my car.

343
00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:43.717 line:80%
The parking spots all sucked.

344
00:30:43.801 --> 00:30:47.638 line:80%
I parked on the fourth basement floor.
The plate's 75NA 1109.

345
00:30:53.936 --> 00:30:56.355 line:80%
Why? Is it out of your league?

346
00:30:57.815 --> 00:30:59.817 line:80%
Do you want to keep chatting here?

347
00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:04.863 line:80%
Women are all the same.

348
00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:06.282 line:80%
Hey, get back to work.

349
00:31:06.824 --> 00:31:08.409 line:80%
Get up right now!

350
00:31:10.369 --> 00:31:12.746 line:80%
I should blow up the breakroom.

351
00:31:24.717 --> 00:31:26.010 line:80%
There you are.

352
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:33.225 line:80%
It's not your fault
you have a crappy owner.

353
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:46.572 line:80%
If my guess is right,

354
00:31:46.655 --> 00:31:48.449 line:80%
you'll be waiting for me.

355
00:31:53.537 --> 00:31:55.414 line:80%
Because you have to comfort me.

356
00:31:56.957 --> 00:32:00.294 line:80%
To teach me that you're the only one
who's on my side.

357
00:32:05.007 --> 00:32:06.759 line:80%
I was worried, so I waited.

358
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.432 line:80%
Did you move the car well?

359
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:15.142 line:80%
Yeah.

360
00:32:17.353 --> 00:32:21.482 line:80%
If you can't give me your proposal,
at least let me join.

361
00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:25.527 line:80%
I'll go to the farm and factory.
I'll work really hard.

362
00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:27.905 line:80%
I have to become a full-time employee.

363
00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:30.532 line:80%
Please? Let me join.

364
00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:32.576 line:80%
I'll think about it.

365
00:32:37.081 --> 00:32:39.249 line:80%
You're not still mad at me, are you?

366
00:32:40.751 --> 00:32:42.252 line:80%
I'm not just saying this.

367
00:32:45.714 --> 00:32:49.593 line:80%
Let's talk it out if you're mad.
You're going to hurt my feelings.

368
00:32:58.852 --> 00:33:02.106 line:80%
We're meant to be together forever!
It's our fate.

369
00:33:03.482 --> 00:33:07.152 line:80%
If I become a full-timer with this,
let's work here until we die!

370
00:33:09.071 --> 00:33:10.072 line:80%
Okay?

371
00:33:11.115 --> 00:33:13.701 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won! Get over here if you're done.

372
00:33:22.376 --> 00:33:26.922 line:80%
When will I get the revised proposal?
You didn't report the team to me either!

373
00:33:28.757 --> 00:33:30.509 line:80%
I'm sorry. It's not done yet.

374
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:33.053 line:80%
I'm sure. Yeah.

375
00:33:33.137 --> 00:33:35.639 line:80%
That's how far your skills go.

376
00:33:36.348 --> 00:33:37.683 line:80%
You can't do it alone,

377
00:33:37.766 --> 00:33:41.103 line:80%
I'll talk to Yang Ju-ran for you.
I already told Su-min.

378
00:33:41.687 --> 00:33:44.106 line:80%
Ms. Yang is already helping me.

379
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:46.984 line:80%
-Hui-yeon is helping too.
-Is she useful at all?

380
00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:48.902 line:80%
What did she say? Forget it.

381
00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:51.613 line:80%
You already submitted your proposal,

382
00:33:51.697 --> 00:33:54.491 line:80%
I didn't say anything
but it overlaps with mine.

383
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:56.618 line:80%
Can I take you out of it?

384
00:33:58.454 --> 00:33:59.788 line:80%
Once my name is on it,

385
00:33:59.872 --> 00:34:02.583 line:80%
it becomes a whole new level.

386
00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:05.085 line:80%
But I'm willing to add you.

387
00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:07.296 line:80%
So stop arguing.

388
00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:08.380 line:80%
Get out.

389
00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:17.222 line:80%
Is this how it plays out?

390
00:34:18.098 --> 00:34:20.517 line:80%
Since I don't give Su-min my proposal,

391
00:34:20.601 --> 00:34:22.519 line:80%
Kim Gyeong-uk will steal it.

392
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:28.066 line:80%
Then he'll add Su-min's name to it.

393
00:34:32.362 --> 00:34:33.363 line:80%
Ms. Kang?

394
00:34:35.616 --> 00:34:36.825 line:80%
Hello, sir.

395
00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:42.247 line:80%
Are you free tonight?

396
00:34:43.749 --> 00:34:45.083 line:80%
Do you need something?

397
00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:47.377 line:80%
No, it's not that.

398
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:52.257 line:80%
I want to buy you dinner.
Let's try to pick a time.

399
00:34:55.886 --> 00:34:58.597 line:80%
I have personal plans tonight.

400
00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:01.350 line:80%
If it's work-related...

401
00:35:03.185 --> 00:35:06.688 line:80%
tell me the TPO and I'll schedule
a time and place to eat.

402
00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:11.026 line:80%
No, you don't need to do all that.

403
00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:15.489 line:80%
Okay.

404
00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:17.366 line:80%
Okay.

405
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.621 line:80%
Personal plans?

406
00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:46.854 line:80%
Eun-ho, I think you have a guest.

407
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.022 line:80%
A guest?

408
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:55.153 line:80%
Ji-won!

409
00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:05.747 line:80%
I thought this was just a restaurant.
Do you know this place?

410
00:36:05.831 --> 00:36:08.917 line:80%
Yeah, our restaurant makes deals
with this wine shop.

411
00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:13.171 line:80%
I wanted to show you a taste
that's out of this world.

412
00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:22.097 line:80%
Doesn't it smell good?
It's a Château Olrang 1999.

413
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.935 line:80%
It was produced the year we first met
in high school.

414
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:29.855 line:80%
It has notes of cedar and cassis.

415
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:32.858 line:80%
Also, it's not easy
to get rich blackberry notes.

416
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.611 line:80%
I can really smell it!

417
00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:38.363 line:80%
I can smell grapes and trees.

418
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.119 line:80%
-It's nice.
-Is it?

419
00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.954 line:80%
Wait a second.

420
00:36:46.038 --> 00:36:47.414 line:80%
The wholesale price

421
00:36:47.497 --> 00:36:50.167 line:80%
for all the wines here
are over a million won.

422
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.460 line:80%
Let's try all of it.

423
00:36:52.127 --> 00:36:53.712 line:80%
Eun-ho.

424
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:56.298 line:80%
To be honest,
I came out to buy you dinner.

425
00:36:56.381 --> 00:36:57.382 line:80%
Have you eaten?

426
00:36:58.467 --> 00:36:59.676 line:80%
Me?

427
00:37:01.803 --> 00:37:05.599 line:80%
I tend to eat dinner a little early.

428
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:07.517 line:80%
I didn't think that far ahead.

429
00:37:08.143 --> 00:37:10.604 line:80%
No, that's okay. Come and sit.

430
00:37:10.687 --> 00:37:12.648 line:80%
It's been so long. Let's talk.

431
00:37:14.316 --> 00:37:15.734 line:80%
Okay.

432
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:36.338 line:80%
What is she doing right now?

433
00:37:37.714 --> 00:37:40.217 line:80%
I wanted to take care of her tonight.

434
00:37:40.884 --> 00:37:42.302 line:80%
She's got terrible luck.

435
00:37:45.889 --> 00:37:46.890 line:80%
Wait a minute.

436
00:38:14.042 --> 00:38:15.877 line:80%
Hey, Min-hwan.

437
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:17.212 line:80%
Hi, Su-min.

438
00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:19.381 line:80%
Are you with Ji-won by any chance?

439
00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:21.008 line:80%
I can't reach her.

440
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:22.551 line:80%
Ji-won left earlier.

441
00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:26.888 line:80%
She looked pretty.
She kept looking in the mirror.

442
00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:30.225 line:80%
I figured she was going on
a date with you. Was I wrong?

443
00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:31.685 line:80%
What?

444
00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:34.187 line:80%
She looked pretty and left?

445
00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:38.150 line:80%
Min-hwan,
you should control Ji-won better.

446
00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:40.277 line:80%
Control? Come on.

447
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.696 line:80%
She wouldn't run off or anything.

448
00:38:42.779 --> 00:38:45.991 line:80%
Why not?
She suddenly changed her style too.

449
00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:47.743 line:80%
You never know with women.

450
00:38:47.826 --> 00:38:51.413 line:80%
Her mom found her soulmate
after she had Ji-won.

451
00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:56.126 line:80%
Still, as a woman,
I think that's really cool.

452
00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:58.920 line:80%
But it's a shame for Ji-won though.

453
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:04.384 line:80%
No, wait...

454
00:39:04.468 --> 00:39:06.178 line:80%
Ji-won's mom...

455
00:39:07.304 --> 00:39:08.430 line:80%
had an affair?

456
00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:10.015 line:80%
What?

457
00:39:11.725 --> 00:39:13.143 line:80%
Did you not know?

458
00:39:15.771 --> 00:39:17.230 line:80%
What do I do?

459
00:39:17.314 --> 00:39:19.066 line:80%
Did I make a mistake?

460
00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:21.276 line:80%
Never mind!

461
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:24.237 line:80%
It wasn't Ji-won. It was another friend...

462
00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.406 line:80%
I mean...

463
00:39:27.574 --> 00:39:32.537 line:80%
I just figured that you already knew.

464
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:33.955 line:80%
Yeah, well...

465
00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:35.540 line:80%
I know her mom left her

466
00:39:35.624 --> 00:39:39.169 line:80%
when she was just a kid.
I knew that already.

467
00:39:39.252 --> 00:39:40.879 line:80%
But the affair hit later...

468
00:39:41.338 --> 00:39:42.881 line:80%
I mean...

469
00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:48.929 line:80%
But you didn't know that she left
because she found true love, right?

470
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.810 line:80%
What do I do?

471
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.689 line:80%
This is driving me crazy.

472
00:40:01.191 --> 00:40:02.275 line:80%
Min-hwan?

473
00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:05.070 line:80%
Just pretend like you didn't hear that.

474
00:40:05.153 --> 00:40:07.155 line:80%
I made a mistake.

475
00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:11.201 line:80%
Having an affair isn't genetics.
It's not a big problem.

476
00:40:12.035 --> 00:40:13.411 line:80%
Of course. Yeah.

477
00:40:13.495 --> 00:40:15.122 line:80%
It's not a problem.

478
00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:22.587 line:80%
I knew it. You're a great guy, Min-hwan.

479
00:40:23.213 --> 00:40:27.384 line:80%
In return, I'll find out
what Ji-won did tonight and let you know.

480
00:40:27.467 --> 00:40:30.095 line:80%
I'm sure she's just working though.

481
00:40:31.304 --> 00:40:34.432 line:80%
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah.

482
00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:37.644 line:80%
Okay, well. Call me.

483
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.271 line:80%
Okay.

484
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:10.135 line:80%
So you told me to never speak to you again
because you thought I turned you down?

485
00:41:10.218 --> 00:41:13.638 line:80%
I never want to speak to you again.

486
00:41:13.722 --> 00:41:16.183 line:80%
No, no, no, no.

487
00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:19.436 line:80%
Don't bring that up.

488
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:22.898 line:80%
You didn't just turn me down--

489
00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:25.150 line:80%
What did I say?

490
00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:28.111 line:80%
By any chance, do you have the letter
I wrote you?

491
00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:32.574 line:80%
Yeah, I do.
You told me to bring it, so I did.

492
00:41:34.326 --> 00:41:35.368 line:80%
Let's see.

493
00:41:39.623 --> 00:41:42.751 line:80%
DO YOU THINK EVERYONE LIKES YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE POPULAR?

494
00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:45.045 line:80%
YOU MAKE ME VOMIT. DON'T SPEAK TO ME!

495
00:41:45.128 --> 00:41:45.962 line:80%
KANG JI-WON

496
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.716 line:80%
Isn't that your handwriting?

497
00:41:52.385 --> 00:41:53.970 line:80%
Yeah, it is.

498
00:41:56.598 --> 00:41:58.433 line:80%
But I really didn't write this.

499
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:04.731 line:80%
That means Su-min is able
to copy my handwriting.

500
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.777 line:80%
I can't believe it.

501
00:42:11.446 --> 00:42:12.656 line:80%
Are you cold?

502
00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:15.200 line:80%
Wait a second.

503
00:42:15.283 --> 00:42:16.493 line:80%
No.

504
00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:19.788 line:80%
I think the air conditioning
is strong here.

505
00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:21.248 line:80%
Shall we go?

506
00:42:21.331 --> 00:42:23.375 line:80%
Sure.

507
00:42:24.292 --> 00:42:25.293 line:80%
Let's do that.

508
00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:35.929 line:80%
Go ahead...

509
00:42:40.517 --> 00:42:41.726 line:80%
Eun-ho.

510
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:47.816 line:80%
I can see through Eun-ho at 31.

511
00:42:49.651 --> 00:42:50.735 line:80%
However...

512
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:55.532 line:80%
I have a boyfriend.

513
00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:01.871 line:80%
Really?

514
00:43:03.873 --> 00:43:08.670 line:80%
By any chance, is he tall
and wears horn-rimmed glasses?

515
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:11.339 line:80%
Horn-rimmed glasses?

516
00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:13.049 line:80%
Yeah.

517
00:43:13.133 --> 00:43:16.219 line:80%
He wore a three button suit.

518
00:43:16.303 --> 00:43:17.721 line:80%
He wasn't fashionable...

519
00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:26.396 line:80%
I mean, he looked classic,
and he had an expensive watch.

520
00:43:28.148 --> 00:43:29.441 line:80%
Was it Mr. Yu?

521
00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:33.820 line:80%
How do you know him?

522
00:43:36.406 --> 00:43:38.950 line:80%
He's the one that told me
about the reunion.

523
00:43:41.036 --> 00:43:42.620 line:80%
How does he know you?

524
00:43:44.748 --> 00:43:47.417 line:80%
Come to think of it, you're right.

525
00:43:48.376 --> 00:43:52.213 line:80%
I thought he was your boyfriend.

526
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:55.216 line:80%
He was really worried about you.

527
00:44:15.737 --> 00:44:17.364 line:80%
You drank six bottles?

528
00:44:17.447 --> 00:44:18.990 line:80%
So six million won?

529
00:44:19.074 --> 00:44:20.658 line:80%
Then she turned you down?

530
00:44:23.995 --> 00:44:26.623 line:80%
-She didn't turn me down.
-Yeah, she did.

531
00:44:26.706 --> 00:44:31.419 line:80%
If she hadn't, you wouldn't
be sitting here sulking like this.

532
00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:35.215 line:80%
Before I give up on her,

533
00:44:35.298 --> 00:44:36.925 line:80%
she didn't turn me down.

534
00:44:38.051 --> 00:44:39.719 line:80%
Even if she has a boyfriend.

535
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:47.185 line:80%
Even if...

536
00:44:47.769 --> 00:44:50.271 line:80%
another man has feelings for her.

537
00:44:51.856 --> 00:44:54.401 line:80%
Did you even take her home?

538
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.779 line:80%
-What?
-She turned you down.

539
00:44:57.862 --> 00:44:59.114 line:80%
Just give up.

540
00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:02.617 line:80%
Darn it...

541
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.623 line:80%
Goodness.

542
00:45:24.305 --> 00:45:25.807 line:80%

MISSED CALL

546
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:07.265 line:80%
It's just stomach cramps.

547
00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:10.143 line:80%
It's not good to drink wine
on an empty stomach.

548
00:46:10.226 --> 00:46:11.186 line:80%
Okay.

549
00:46:13.146 --> 00:46:16.733 line:80%
Once the pain subsides,
take the medicine with warm soups.

550
00:46:16.816 --> 00:46:18.568 line:80%
Okay, here you go.

551
00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:39.380 line:80%
Wine isn't good on an empty stomach.

552
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:16.251 line:80%
You scared me!

553
00:47:19.254 --> 00:47:21.631 line:80%
Are you crazy? Why are you overreacting?

554
00:47:22.966 --> 00:47:24.342 line:80%
Was it you?

555
00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:26.427 line:80%
Why?

556
00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.597 line:80%
Were you hoping it was another man?

557
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.141 line:80%
No...

558
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:36.521 line:80%
Why would you follow me like that?
You could've just called out.

559
00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:40.525 line:80%
Why should I make you comfortable?
You don't even pick up my calls!

560
00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:42.986 line:80%
What?

561
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:44.737 line:80%
Be real.

562
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:47.198 line:80%
You're being overly self-conscious.

563
00:47:47.657 --> 00:47:51.536 line:80%
Men aren't interested in you! Got it?

564
00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:53.913 line:80%
Still, seeing you scared

565
00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:55.790 line:80%
made it more fun.

566
00:47:56.541 --> 00:47:57.750 line:80%
Is this fun for you?

567
00:47:58.418 --> 00:47:59.419 line:80%
Yeah, it's fun.

568
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:05.633 line:80%
By the way...

569
00:48:06.676 --> 00:48:07.677 line:80%
Where were you?

570
00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:11.931 line:80%
Did you reapply lipstick after work?

571
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:14.434 line:80%
What are you saying?

572
00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:15.685 line:80%
See!

573
00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:19.856 line:80%
Why are your lips so red?

574
00:48:22.442 --> 00:48:26.029 line:80%
Who were you hitting on now?
What's on your face?

575
00:48:26.112 --> 00:48:28.281 line:80%
Is that blush?

576
00:48:29.324 --> 00:48:30.325 line:80%
Your face is rosy.

577
00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:34.537 line:80%
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

578
00:48:39.334 --> 00:48:40.668 line:80%
What did you just say?

579
00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:43.546 line:80%
What?

580
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.506 line:80%
What did you just say, Min-hwan?

581
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:46.424 line:80%
What?

582
00:48:47.383 --> 00:48:48.718 line:80%
I didn't say anything.

583
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:52.930 line:80%
I'm only being like this
because you're being shady!

584
00:48:54.474 --> 00:48:55.808 line:80%
It was Su-min.

585
00:48:55.892 --> 00:48:58.394 line:80%
She told him about my mom.

586
00:48:58.478 --> 00:48:59.604 line:80%
What?

587
00:48:59.687 --> 00:49:01.648 line:80%
You are acting strange lately.

588
00:49:01.731 --> 00:49:03.775 line:80%
You don't normally buy clothes!

589
00:49:04.692 --> 00:49:05.693 line:80%
What's this?

590
00:49:07.654 --> 00:49:08.696 line:80%
Is that perfume?

591
00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:11.908 line:80%
What perfume? It's soap!

592
00:49:14.494 --> 00:49:16.037 line:80%
Where'd you go after work?

593
00:49:17.121 --> 00:49:18.206 line:80%
Tell me the truth.

594
00:49:21.918 --> 00:49:22.919 line:80%
Let go of me!

595
00:49:25.672 --> 00:49:26.964 line:80%
That hurts.

596
00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:28.549 line:80%
This little...

597
00:49:29.509 --> 00:49:31.636 line:80%
I'll see what time you clocked out.

598
00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:33.137 line:80%
So tell me the truth.

599
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:34.806 line:80%
What did you do?

600
00:49:34.889 --> 00:49:36.516 line:80%
What the hell?

601
00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:51.447 line:80%
Is that you, Mr. Yu?

602
00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:56.327 line:80%
Sir?

603
00:49:59.914 --> 00:50:03.251 line:80%
What's your deal?
So what if you're the general manager?

604
00:50:04.377 --> 00:50:06.045 line:80%
What's going on between you?

605
00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:08.131 line:80%
Are you crazy--

606
00:50:09.882 --> 00:50:11.217 line:80%
Wait...

607
00:50:12.719 --> 00:50:14.887 line:80%
She was going to die anyway, right?

608
00:50:16.556 --> 00:50:17.807 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

609
00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:20.935 line:80%
You can't do this!

610
00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:28.234 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

611
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:32.488 line:80%
Let go of me!

612
00:50:34.282 --> 00:50:35.283 line:80%
Damn it...

613
00:50:37.702 --> 00:50:38.703 line:80%
Damn it.

614
00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:02.477 line:80%
Wait. Why did I run away?

615
00:51:04.187 --> 00:51:08.065 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk, that bastard.
I could've taken him any other day...

616
00:51:14.614 --> 00:51:17.950 line:80%
It's Yu Ji-hyuk.
He has no reason to follow me.

617
00:51:18.993 --> 00:51:20.036 line:80%
What?

618
00:51:22.497 --> 00:51:24.040 line:80%
But why didn't Ji-won follow me?

619
00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:27.668 line:80%
Is she out of her mind?

620
00:51:28.252 --> 00:51:29.504 line:80%
What?

621
00:51:30.046 --> 00:51:31.047 line:80%
Together?

622
00:51:32.215 --> 00:51:33.299 line:80%
Crap!

623
00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:46.813 line:80%
Leaving a woman behind
in a situation like this

624
00:51:47.939 --> 00:51:49.565 line:80%
was my husband.

625
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:58.157 line:80%
How's your wrist?

626
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.079 line:80%
But what are you doing here?

627
00:52:05.748 --> 00:52:08.918 line:80%
I had business in the area.

628
00:52:10.169 --> 00:52:11.629 line:80%
What business?

629
00:52:13.714 --> 00:52:14.966 line:80%
Well, the thing is...

630
00:52:20.847 --> 00:52:23.432 line:80%
you wouldn't answer your phone.

631
00:52:26.477 --> 00:52:29.981 line:80%
I figured nothing happened,
but just to be sure.

632
00:52:30.565 --> 00:52:32.316 line:80%
Why are you worried about me?

633
00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:35.444 line:80%
It's after work hours.

634
00:52:35.528 --> 00:52:38.614 line:80%
Even if something were to happen to me,

635
00:52:39.365 --> 00:52:42.243 line:80%
-it has nothing to do with you.
-Yes, it does.

636
00:52:47.081 --> 00:52:48.499 line:80%
I'm worried

637
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:51.460 line:80%
Mr. Park might hurt you.

638
00:52:56.507 --> 00:52:59.886 line:80%
Why would you think that way?

639
00:52:59.969 --> 00:53:01.596 line:80%
People don't change.

640
00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:05.224 line:80%
They repeat their actions.

641
00:53:06.017 --> 00:53:09.520 line:80%
He does have violent tendencies,
did he catch on to that?

642
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:12.773 line:80%
I didn't know before I got married.

643
00:53:13.608 --> 00:53:16.319 line:80%
-Min-hwan has never touched me like--
-I just saw him.

644
00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:22.742 line:80%
This isn't that bad.

645
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.870 line:80%
No, don't say it like that.

646
00:53:26.454 --> 00:53:29.081 line:80%
No one is allowed to touch you like that.

647
00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:33.419 line:80%
It's no big deal?

648
00:53:34.462 --> 00:53:36.714 line:80%
I should've broken all of his fingers.

649
00:53:37.298 --> 00:53:40.384 line:80%
I could tell he is insightful
because of NurTV.

650
00:53:40.968 --> 00:53:42.136 line:80%
The problem is...

651
00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.512 line:80%
No.

652
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:48.351 line:80%
It was fun seeing Min-hwan so scared.

653
00:53:51.854 --> 00:53:55.608 line:80%
So that's not the problem.

654
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:03.616 line:80%
What's going on?

655
00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:08.162 line:80%
I came to see her fight with Min-hwan.

656
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.377 line:80%
PARK MIN-HWAN

657
00:54:16.379 --> 00:54:17.213 line:80%
SLIDE TO ANSWER

658
00:54:19.215 --> 00:54:20.341 line:80%
Hello?

659
00:54:20.925 --> 00:54:22.176 line:80%
Yes, Min-hwan?

660
00:54:24.637 --> 00:54:26.973 line:80%
The way you're acting is uncomfortable.

661
00:54:27.932 --> 00:54:29.058 line:80%
I'm just worried...

662
00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:31.602 line:80%
I don't want you to worry.

663
00:54:33.396 --> 00:54:35.731 line:80%
Your feelings make me uncomfortable.

664
00:54:38.234 --> 00:54:40.820 line:80%
Do you know how I feel?

665
00:54:46.409 --> 00:54:49.120 line:80%
I don't like cheating
for personal reasons.

666
00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:52.790 line:80%
I don't think a person
should betray anyone.

667
00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:56.711 line:80%
I've taken care of that.

668
00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.548 line:80%
You what?

669
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:07.263 line:80%
Is your girlfriend
a task to be taken care of?

670
00:55:07.346 --> 00:55:10.641 line:80%
-No, that's not--
-Wow, I didn't take you for that type.

671
00:55:11.183 --> 00:55:12.977 line:80%
You're worse than I thought.

672
00:55:15.062 --> 00:55:18.774 line:80%
Hui-yeon is a very precious person to me.

673
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.445 line:80%
Hui-yeon is so nice and pretty.

674
00:55:22.528 --> 00:55:24.363 line:80%
She's very lovable...

675
00:55:26.907 --> 00:55:30.036 line:80%
Forget it.
I'm going to talk to her myself.

676
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.248 line:80%
No, wait, Ji-won. Just a second.

677
00:55:34.999 --> 00:55:36.167 line:80%
Calm down first.

678
00:55:38.169 --> 00:55:39.503 line:80%
Will you hear me out?

679
00:55:42.298 --> 00:55:44.592 line:80%
You think I'm dating Yu Hui-yeon

680
00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:46.969 line:80%
and I'm trying to cheat on her?

681
00:55:47.553 --> 00:55:49.472 line:80%
Because I have feelings for you.

682
00:55:49.722 --> 00:55:51.182 line:80%
Are you not?

683
00:55:52.892 --> 00:55:54.226 line:80%
You're right.

684
00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:58.397 line:80%
Just the part about me liking you.

685
00:56:02.902 --> 00:56:03.903 line:80%
Now...

686
00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:12.787 line:80%
MOST BEAUTIFUL

687
00:56:17.291 --> 00:56:20.127 line:80%
Why are you calling so late at night?
It's scary.

688
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:22.755 line:80%
-Hui-yeon.
-
This phone will self-destruct

689
00:56:22.838 --> 00:56:25.341 line:80%
in five seconds
if you don't get to the point.

690
00:56:25.424 --> 00:56:26.801 line:80%
-
Five, four--
-I love you.

691
00:56:30.638 --> 00:56:32.306 line:80%
Does she sound like my girlfriend?

692
00:56:34.683 --> 00:56:35.768 line:80%
MOST BEAUTIFUL

693
00:56:38.104 --> 00:56:40.815 line:80%
Just so you know,
Hui-yeon saved it like this.

694
00:56:46.445 --> 00:56:49.198 line:80%
I shouldn't see you for a month
after that!

695
00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:52.034 line:80%
But I'll have to see you at work tomorrow.

696
00:56:52.118 --> 00:56:56.622 line:80%
Are you terminally ill or something?
Are you leaving the family register now?

697
00:56:56.747 --> 00:56:58.290 line:80%
END CALL

698
00:57:00.042 --> 00:57:01.544 line:80%
I...

699
00:57:04.797 --> 00:57:05.798 line:80%
Wait...

700
00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:10.719 line:80%
So, she's your sister!

701
00:57:12.012 --> 00:57:13.264 line:80%
Yu Hui-yeon.

702
00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:14.640 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk.

703
00:57:20.104 --> 00:57:22.815 line:80%
What do I do? I'm so sorry!

704
00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:27.111 line:80%
Please forget everything I said today.

705
00:57:27.194 --> 00:57:29.655 line:80%
I have made a huge misunderstanding.

706
00:57:31.574 --> 00:57:33.659 line:80%
You didn't misunderstand all of it.

707
00:57:35.536 --> 00:57:36.620 line:80%
I...

708
00:57:44.628 --> 00:57:45.838 line:80%
like you a lot.

709
00:58:09.195 --> 00:58:10.863 line:80%
Thanks for bringing me home.

710
00:58:34.386 --> 00:58:35.930 line:80%
Mr. Yu...

711
00:58:38.224 --> 00:58:39.225 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

712
00:58:39.308 --> 00:58:40.392 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

713
00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:43.395 line:80%
What do I do?

714
00:58:44.313 --> 00:58:45.481 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

715
00:58:45.564 --> 00:58:46.565 line:80%
Mr. Yu?

716
00:58:48.901 --> 00:58:50.361 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

717
00:59:06.293 --> 00:59:08.087 line:80%
So for Ji-won's sake,

718
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:09.463 line:80%
you should break up.

719
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:11.257 line:80%
Don't you think you're out of line?

720
00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:15.261 line:80%
The first step to win is to get
on the mat and face your opponent.

721
00:59:15.594 --> 00:59:19.807 line:80%
I have to stop letting shameless people
take things from me.

722
00:59:20.224 --> 00:59:23.352 line:80%
He's the most decent man
Ji-won has ever met.

723
00:59:23.435 --> 00:59:24.270 line:80%
You're out.

724
00:59:24.645 --> 00:59:28.315 line:80%
It'd be good to use
Director Wang's name to promote it.

725
00:59:28.399 --> 00:59:30.109 line:80%
You're capable of fighting well.

726
00:59:30.859 --> 00:59:33.362 line:80%
First, get on the mat
and face my opponent.

727
00:59:33.445 --> 00:59:35.781 line:80%
The problem is, how do I flip it?

728
00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:43.289 line:80%
