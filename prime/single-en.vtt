The
tilakam
on your forehead
doesn't sit right. Check it, dear boy.

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:54.875 line:80%
My life isn't right either.

Lord!

00:03:57.776 --> 00:03:58.735 line:80%
Lord of the Seven Hills!

00:03:59.193 --> 00:04:01.943 line:80%
I've been worshipping you
for seven years.

7
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:03.735 line:80%
But you've chosen to leave me single.

8
00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.151 line:80%
Please find me a companion, Lord.

12
00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:19.026 line:80%
Please help me find love, Lord.
What's this, Lord?

13
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.443 line:80%
Just this. I know you'll
make my wish come true.

Lord, don't let him know
I already have a girlfriend.

Lord!

Whether I land a girl or not,
please make sure this guy doesn't.

17
00:04:31.573 --> 00:04:33.568 line:80%
This is my sincere request. Please!

18
00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:40.193 line:80%
Why did you call at this hour?
He's right next to me.

19
00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:41.943 line:80%
I asked you to bring Vijay to the metro.

20
00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:44.151 line:80%
I asked you not to.
He'll feel jealous.

21
00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:46.860 line:80%
-It doesn't matter. Just bring him.
-Why're you using a phone in the temple?

22
00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:48.651 line:80%
-Come fast!
-Okay. Call you back.

23
00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:51.651 line:80%
-I have to go somewhere urgently.
-I'm fasting today.

24
00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:55.318 line:80%
-Prasadam
is allowed.
-Come, I need you for something.

25
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:01.068 line:80%
Why did he bring me here?

26
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.693 line:80%
Why did you bring me here?

27
00:05:04.526 --> 00:05:05.735 line:80%
What, are you scared?

28
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.235 line:80%
I'm not scared.

29
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.735 line:80%
I'm just shy.

30
00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:10.568 line:80%
Shy? What did you do
to be so ashamed?

31
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.485 line:80%
Can't you tell the difference

32
00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:14.943 line:80%
between guilt and shyness
from an achievement?

33
00:05:15.318 --> 00:05:19.110 line:80%
-Achievement? What have you done?
-Hey, Vijay. Look into my eyes.

34
00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:21.193 line:80%
-What do you see?
-Do you have pink eye?

35
00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:22.401 line:80%
Don't be silly!

36
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:24.568 line:80%
I'm not single anymore!

37
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.276 line:80%
Last night, Gayathri said yes
to my proposal.

38
00:05:28.693 --> 00:05:29.735 line:80%
I'm a lover boy!

39
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.943 line:80%
-What!
-She fell for this guy?

40
00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:34.360 line:80%
-I'm feeling sick. I need to go.
-Are you disappointed?

41
00:05:34.443 --> 00:05:37.235 line:80%
-Why would I be disappointed?
-Gayathri's here!

42
00:05:37.318 --> 00:05:38.235 line:80%
-Is it?
-Yes.

43
00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:39.610 line:80%
Who? Who? Who?

44
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:42.235 line:80%
Is it the woman
cleaning the platform there?

45
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.735 line:80%
Or the blind woman with
the glasses over there?

46
00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:47.401 line:80%
Is that her? Tell me. Tell me.
Who is that lucky girl?

47
00:05:47.443 --> 00:05:48.901 line:80%
You seem pretty disappointed already.

48
00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:50.151 line:80%
Don't be shocked.

49
00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:51.485 line:80%
She's over there.

50
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.610 line:80%
She's in a blue dress.
That's Gayathri!

51
00:05:54.026 --> 00:05:55.943 line:80%
Hey! I brought her here
to introduce you.

52
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.276 line:80%
Hey, can you do me a favor?

53
00:05:57.443 --> 00:05:59.026 line:80%
Just like that skinny guy
carries Rajinikanth's movie,

54
00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:00.568 line:80%
can you please elevate me a bit?

55
00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:03.068 line:80%
-Just watch Nandamuri Thaman elevate--
-Don't do anything physical.

56
00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:05.318 line:80%
Hello, Ms. Gayathri.

57
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.026 line:80%
Is your pet name Lakshmi?
Because you look graceful.

58
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.110 line:80%
-Who are these? Your kids?
-My kids.

59
00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:11.276 line:80%
I have no chain right now.

60
00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:14.068 line:80%
-Can you call me "uncle," dear?
-Uncle!

61
00:06:14.276 --> 00:06:15.401 line:80%
-Balayya!
-Yeah?

62
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:17.818 line:80%
I can't meet your "high" expectations,

63
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.360 line:80%
-but Gayathri is over there.
-Who are these people then?

64
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.068 line:80%
They're just random passersby.

65
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.610 line:80%
-They're more your type!
-I said, over there!

66
00:06:22.818 --> 00:06:23.901 line:80%
There, huh?

67
00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:26.110 line:80%
-Gayathri, this is Vijay.
-Hi, Vijay.

68
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.360 line:80%
She looks so awful up close.

69
00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:31.193 line:80%
Gayathri, do you know
how lucky you are?

70
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.860 line:80%
Do you know how much he loves you?

71
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.068 line:80%
He wakes up at 4:30 and
listens to the Gayathri mantra.

72
00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:39.443 line:80%
When asked why, he says,
"Because it has Gayathri in it."

73
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:44.193 line:80%
For instance, he watches the Rajnikanth
starrer
Gayathri
every night.

74
00:06:44.235 --> 00:06:46.901 line:80%
When asked why, he says,
"Because it has Gayathri in it."

75
00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:49.651 line:80%
-Oh! So sweet!
-How's my elevation?

76
00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:51.401 line:80%
Even though my friend's salary
is just 30,000,

77
00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:53.526 line:80%
he will treat you like a queen.

78
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:58.110 line:80%
-You told me it's 60,000.
-It is, in fact, 60,000, dear.

79
00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.526 line:80%
According to Narmada Raghuram...

80
00:06:59.568 --> 00:07:01.693 line:80%
I asked you to elevate me,
but you're trying to eliminate me.

81
00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:02.985 line:80%
Ruined.
It's all ruined!

82
00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:04.943 line:80%
Anyway, how did you two meet?

83
00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:07.026 line:80%
We had a crush on the same girl.
But that didn't work out.

84
00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:08.485 line:80%
She fell for an attendant, though.
That day...

85
00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:10.026 line:80%
-For an attendant?
-This idiot overreacted.

86
00:07:10.068 --> 00:07:12.276 line:80%
-He said I was his first love.
-Well, you are his first love.

87
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.360 line:80%
Overall, he tried to
propose to two or three girls at school.

88
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:17.443 line:80%
One even filed a police complaint
and they stripped and thrashed him.

89
00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:19.110 line:80%
I wanted you to praise me
but you're burying me.

90
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:20.693 line:80%
Anirudh, please go back to
Chennai, dude.

91
00:07:20.818 --> 00:07:24.068 line:80%
Hey, hold on. Vijay, I want to know
everything about Aravind.

92
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.818 line:80%
-In a nutshell, our guy here is...
-In a single word!

93
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.818 line:80%
Just the summary.

94
00:07:26.943 --> 00:07:29.276 line:80%
Whenever he feels like drinking,
he never drinks in Ameerpet.

95
00:07:29.318 --> 00:07:32.360 line:80%
He drives five kilometers and only
drinks at the Erragadda wine shop.

96
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:33.943 line:80%
-Do you know why?
-Why?

97
00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:36.651 line:80%
That wine shop's name is
Gayathri Wines.

98
00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:38.485 line:80%
-Dude, are you satisfied now?
-Shit!

99
00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:39.651 line:80%
You never told me you drink!

100
00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:41.985 line:80%
My goodness, drinking? If only
you saw his medical reports...

101
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:43.818 line:80%
-Excuse me.
-Huh?!

102
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.193 line:80%
Hmm. How did you like my elevation?

103
00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:47.026 line:80%
Why did you spill all my secrets,
like "Wiki Leaks"?

104
00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:48.068 line:80%
What's your intention?

105
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.568 line:80%
Being in love means
being open and honest.

106
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.151 line:80%
Keeping things to yourself now
may cause problems later.

107
00:07:51.193 --> 00:07:52.693 line:80%
Later? I'm already in trouble here.

108
00:07:52.776 --> 00:07:54.776 line:80%
She even has buck teeth.
Look at her.

109
00:07:54.901 --> 00:07:56.026 line:80%
Why are you staring at her teeth?

110
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.735 line:80%
Okay! You've fallen in love.
Why should I come between you two?

111
00:07:59.818 --> 00:08:02.735 line:80%
I will step aside.
Please resolve any remaining matters.

112
00:08:02.776 --> 00:08:04.860 line:80%
It's alright. will see
after getting married.

113
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:05.735 line:80%
-Bye, Vijay.
-Hey, Anirudh...

114
00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.401 line:80%
He's like an old crow!
And a love story!

115
00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:09.068 line:80%
-You only earn 30,000.
-That's just how friends are.

116
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.360 line:80%
-Do you drink?
-They joke like that.

Good morning, sir.
How can I help you?

124
00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.401 line:80%
-Excuse me, sir.

125

-A Benz. A Benz.

126
00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:15.443 line:80%
Sir, this is an Audi showroom.

127
00:10:15.943 --> 00:10:16.818 line:80%
Oh!

128
00:10:17.443 --> 00:10:19.818 line:80%
-How much is this car?
-1.8 crores, sir.

129
00:10:19.901 --> 00:10:20.860 line:80%
Very, very cheap.

130
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:23.110 line:80%
Are there no cars worth ₹10 crores
in our company?

131
00:10:23.526 --> 00:10:26.193 line:80%
₹10 crores?
You'd have to pre-book that, sir.

132
00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:27.651 line:80%
Thanks for reminding me.

133
00:10:29.485 --> 00:10:31.068 line:80%
-Are you booking it, sir?
-Hmm.

134
00:10:31.193 --> 00:10:34.193 line:80%
-Oh, what are you booking, sir?
-A Happido ride.

135
00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:36.776 line:80%
Ugh!

136
00:10:38.235 --> 00:10:40.193 line:80%
-Good morning, everybody!
-Present, sir.

137
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:43.901 line:80%
-The bank is like a temple.
-May all beings everywhere be happy.

138
00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.735 line:80%
It's a bit much. Sit down.

139
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:47.151 line:80%
Excuse me, sir?

140
00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:51.068 line:80%
You're always late to the bank.

141
00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:54.193 line:80%
You could at least
be on time for the meeting.

142
00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:58.818 line:80%
-The meeting's also at the bank, sir!
-You dare imitate me? I'm coming to you.

143
00:10:58.901 --> 00:11:00.526 line:80%
You're very good at counters!

144
00:11:00.651 --> 00:11:06.068 line:80%
We'll get more business if you
use counters with the customers too!

145
00:11:06.568 --> 00:11:08.068 line:80%
I'm starting again!

146
00:11:08.193 --> 00:11:09.651 line:80%
The bank is a temple!

147
00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:14.610 line:80%
Earlier, people
stored money in the temple.

148
00:11:14.651 --> 00:11:16.526 line:80%
Now, they store it in a bank.

149
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:18.735 line:80%
So, the customer is a dog!

150
00:11:18.943 --> 00:11:20.943 line:80%
Sir, the customer is god!

151
00:11:21.235 --> 00:11:22.860 line:80%
You heard correctly!

152
00:11:23.026 --> 00:11:24.610 line:80%
Customer is a dog!

153
00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:30.235 line:80%
Treat customers with the same affection
and respect as your beloved pets.

154
00:11:31.318 --> 00:11:35.026 line:80%
-Only then will our business grow.
-See?

155
00:11:35.651 --> 00:11:37.360 line:80%
Manufacturing defect.

156
00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:43.568 line:80%
So, did you reach your target?

157
00:11:44.776 --> 00:11:46.110 line:80%
I have to lose two kilos.

158
00:11:46.193 --> 00:11:48.860 line:80%
I'm not asking about your weight loss!

159
00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:51.860 line:80%
I'm asking about the insurance policy.

160
00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:53.401 line:80%
Two policies are pending, sir.

161
00:11:53.443 --> 00:11:56.401 line:80%
-Isn't two your target?
-Those two are pending.

162
00:11:56.485 --> 00:11:57.860 line:80%
A small doubt, sir.

163
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.401 line:80%
-You said the bank is a temple. Right?
-Yes.

164
00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:01.901 line:80%
Temple can get donations.

165
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:03.901 line:80%
There's a temple next door.

166
00:12:03.943 --> 00:12:05.943 line:80%
Collect the donations.

167
00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:08.818 line:80%
Eat
pulihora
and go home.

168
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.693 line:80%
-Both get out.
-Okay, sir

169
00:12:09.735 --> 00:12:11.151 line:80%
Come, I have to tell you something.

170
00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:24.360 line:80%
Who's that girl?

171
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.568 line:80%
Oh, shit! How do you know?

172
00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:30.360 line:80%
Do you think I didn't see you
following her desperately

173
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:31.610 line:80%
like a pamphlet distributor?

174
00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:33.651 line:80%
Who's she? What is she doing?
What's the story?

175
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.568 line:80%
I don't know her.

176
00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:37.526 line:80%
She has a big job in an Audi showroom.

177
00:12:37.568 --> 00:12:39.235 line:80%
-Main.
-Main?

178
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.235 line:80%
Why are you delaying it?!
Propose to her!

179
00:12:41.526 --> 00:12:43.401 line:80%
I proposed to Ileana in 10th grade.

180
00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:45.235 line:80%
-What happened?
-Ileana?

181
00:12:45.318 --> 00:12:46.276 line:80%
Ileana?!

182
00:12:48.776 --> 00:12:50.610 line:80%
-Hey! She's coming. Go now.
-Wait!

183
00:12:50.735 --> 00:12:51.985 line:80%
-Ileana!
-Yes?

184
00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:54.443 line:80%
I love you.

185
00:12:54.985 --> 00:12:56.068 line:80%
I love you, too!

186
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.693 line:80%
What happened, bro?

187
00:12:58.235 --> 00:13:01.193 line:80%
-She's already in love with two guys.
-Two lovers?

188
00:13:02.193 --> 00:13:04.860 line:80%
It was a little mix-up
from not knowing English.

189
00:13:04.943 --> 00:13:06.193 line:80%
Give her a love letter!

190
00:13:06.235 --> 00:13:07.860 line:80%
I gave one to
Mamata Kulkarni in 11th grade!

191
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:08.318 line:80%
Mamata?

192
00:13:08.401 --> 00:13:10.610 line:80%
It was a love letter!
Don't give such silly ideas!

193
00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:14.818 line:80%
God, please ensure
this works out this time.

194
00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:16.276 line:80%
Mamata!

195
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.401 line:80%
Two rupees.

196
00:13:26.985 --> 00:13:28.276 line:80%
It was the wrong place
to give the letter!

197
00:13:28.818 --> 00:13:30.026 line:80%
I won't repeat such mistakes.

198
00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:32.193 line:80%
I'll craft a master plan to win her over!

199
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.276 line:80%
Dude!

200
00:13:33.318 --> 00:13:35.860 line:80%
Out of curiosity... how's the girl?

201
00:13:35.985 --> 00:13:37.443 line:80%
She's more beautiful than Gayathri!

202
00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.360 line:80%
Why bring up Gayathri now?
Why bring up her beauty?

203
00:13:40.443 --> 00:13:42.485 line:80%
Hey, I didn't say anything about
Gayathri's buck teeth.

204
00:13:42.526 --> 00:13:44.985 line:80%
I just said my lover is
more beautiful than Gayathri.

205
00:13:48.901 --> 00:13:49.943 line:80%
Wait here.

206
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:53.693 line:80%
I've devised the perfect plan
to win over the Audi girl!

207
00:13:53.943 --> 00:13:55.818 line:80%
You saw her just today
and that too with full makeup!

208
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:56.901 line:80%
Why are you in such haste?

209
00:13:56.985 --> 00:13:59.526 line:80%
Should I delay it for
several years like you?

210
00:13:59.735 --> 00:14:00.735 line:80%
One week is plenty!

211
00:14:00.818 --> 00:14:03.526 line:80%
It took you years to impress
someone like Gayathri with her buck teeth.

212
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.693 line:80%
Are you giving me useless ideas?

213
00:14:04.735 --> 00:14:07.776 line:80%
If you dare utter pure Gayathri's
name again, you'll face my wrath!

214
00:14:07.818 --> 00:14:09.568 line:80%
There are three ways
to win a girl's heart!

215
00:14:09.818 --> 00:14:11.318 line:80%
Number one, good boys.

216
00:14:11.443 --> 00:14:13.318 line:80%
Helping old people cross the road,

217
00:14:13.401 --> 00:14:15.443 line:80%
covering beggars on the road
with blankets,

218
00:14:15.526 --> 00:14:17.193 line:80%
distributing
pulihora
packets to kids.

219
00:14:17.318 --> 00:14:18.901 line:80%
This is a time-consuming process.

220
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.985 line:80%
Number two, show off a bad-boy attitude!

221
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.318 line:80%
Use foul language unnecessarily.

222
00:14:23.443 --> 00:14:26.068 line:80%
Talk about the alpha male theory,
even if no one asked!

223
00:14:26.901 --> 00:14:28.568 line:80%
Such antics won't suit my image!

224
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:29.568 line:80%
You need an image first!

225
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.860 line:80%
And number three, mass boys!

226
00:14:32.026 --> 00:14:35.360 line:80%
-That's me.
-Do you even know what you're doing?

227
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.693 line:80%
We went up and came down
for number two.

228
00:14:39.151 --> 00:14:41.776 line:80%
Mass boys... when someone harasses them

229
00:14:43.735 --> 00:14:44.901 line:80%
And recite Sanskrit shlokas.

230
00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:48.276 line:80%
If someone tries to throw acid
on a girl, step in and shield her.

231
00:14:48.443 --> 00:14:50.943 line:80%
Even if it's the most painful,
the results will be very fast!

232
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.401 line:80%
If anyone passes a comment
on Purva, I'll threaten him.

233
00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:57.735 line:80%
Purva is not Gayathri
to be commented upon!

234
00:14:57.901 --> 00:14:59.776 line:80%
Revenge! Who will comment?

235
00:15:03.026 --> 00:15:04.443 line:80%
These are my rowdy boys!

236
00:15:06.776 --> 00:15:09.235 line:80%
What's up, my rowdy boys?

237
00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:10.901 line:80%
Hello, bro!

238
00:15:10.985 --> 00:15:12.485 line:80%
Tell us whom to threaten!

239
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.651 line:80%
-No threats!
-Then, let's go!

240
00:15:14.776 --> 00:15:16.485 line:80%
Pass a comment on a girl I show you.

241
00:15:16.526 --> 00:15:19.776 line:80%
Then, I'll come in and say that
divinity blossoms where women are honored.

242
00:15:19.901 --> 00:15:22.235 line:80%
I'll come and hit you!

243
00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:24.110 line:80%
-We have to pass comments?
-Yes.

244
00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:26.360 line:80%
Sorry, sir. We can't do it!

245
00:15:26.443 --> 00:15:27.985 line:80%
What?! You are rowdies, right?

246
00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:30.276 line:80%
Aren't rowdies also humans, sir?

247
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.360 line:80%
We also have families.

248
00:15:33.526 --> 00:15:34.860 line:80%
We have sisters.

249
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:37.318 line:80%
Films portray us in a bad light.

250
00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:38.776 line:80%
We are not that bad.

251
00:15:38.943 --> 00:15:41.151 line:80%
You are rowdies! You shouldn't
have any sentiments.

252
00:15:41.318 --> 00:15:43.360 line:80%
We're sentimental rowdies!

253
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.276 line:80%
We can't do it. Bye.
Let's go.

254
00:15:45.318 --> 00:15:47.776 line:80%
Looks like they're
Venkatesh fans! Too sentimental!

255
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.401 line:80%
Hey! You asked about
recovery agent jobs in a bank.

256
00:15:50.485 --> 00:15:52.235 line:80%
Don't you want it? 101 people
are eagerly waiting for this job.

257
00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.401 line:80%
We're up for the job.

258
00:15:55.693 --> 00:15:56.901 line:80%
-Okay, sir.
-Alright.

259
00:15:57.485 --> 00:15:58.818 line:80%
I'll just make two comments.

260
00:15:59.235 --> 00:16:00.235 line:80%
What will you say?

261
00:16:01.985 --> 00:16:04.526 line:80%
That girl is absolutely gorgeous, brother!

262
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.568 line:80%
[in unison] Yes. She's traditional.

263
00:16:06.818 --> 00:16:09.943 line:80%
Place the blouse piece, coconut,
and vermilion on the
thamboolam.

264
00:16:09.985 --> 00:16:12.985 line:80%
Why do they sound like
elderly women at an engagement?

265
00:16:13.818 --> 00:16:14.860 line:80%
Hey!

266
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.610 line:80%
I'll tell you what to comment.
Round up here.

267
00:16:18.318 --> 00:16:19.401 line:80%
Think of me as the girl.

268
00:16:19.526 --> 00:16:20.526 line:80%
He, a girl?!

269
00:16:20.568 --> 00:16:22.443 line:80%
Just assume. Don't put me
in a trolley and leave.

270
00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:23.443 line:80%
Hey, girl!

271
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.651 line:80%
-You're like a
puri!
-Don't touch!

272
00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:28.068 line:80%
-Hey
Chiquita!
-Not
Chiquita.
I'm Samantha!

273
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.943 line:80%
Como estas?

274
00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:30.401 line:80%
Don't touch there. I'm telling you.

275
00:16:30.443 --> 00:16:32.110 line:80%
Come. I'll give you!

276
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:33.985 line:80%
That's it!

277
00:16:34.068 --> 00:16:35.651 line:80%
-Is that it?
-That's all!

278
00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:37.943 line:80%
-Super, bro!
-Very good!

279
00:16:38.026 --> 00:16:39.735 line:80%
-See that old woman?
-Yeah, for now.

280
00:16:40.026 --> 00:16:42.235 line:80%
She'll take the girl to the washroom.

281
00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:43.901 line:80%
Look for the right time and begin!

282
00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:46.818 line:80%
Follow, follow, follow, follow, you!

283
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.151 line:80%
Let's go check how far Purva has reached.

284
00:16:57.068 --> 00:16:58.401 line:80%
Who's recording there?

285
00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:01.068 line:80%
Hello...Hello...Hey...
Pink dress...Over.

286
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.151 line:80%
The girl looks like a
parota!

287
00:17:14.526 --> 00:17:16.651 line:80%
Not
parota!
She looks like puri!

288
00:17:17.443 --> 00:17:19.276 line:80%
She's neither a
puri!
nor a parota

289
00:17:19.318 --> 00:17:20.735 line:80%
she's a
punugu!

290
00:17:21.026 --> 00:17:22.610 line:80%
Not a bisque cake like you?

291
00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:24.276 line:80%
Hey! Pig-assed fellow!

292
00:17:24.568 --> 00:17:25.901 line:80%
When did you see that?

293
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.610 line:80%
-Bear.
-Were you the one who saw it?

294
00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:34.568 line:80%
Follow girls on Instagram.

295
00:17:35.443 --> 00:17:36.443 line:80%
There's nothing wrong.

296
00:17:36.818 --> 00:17:38.443 line:80%
Comment on Facebook.

297
00:17:39.193 --> 00:17:40.526 line:80%
Not a problem.

298
00:17:40.651 --> 00:17:44.401 line:80%
Why do you harass girls in real life?

299
00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:45.568 line:80%
-Bloody fool!
-Instead of harassing

300
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.151 line:80%
Do you want me to take her to Chilkur?

301
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.526 line:80%
Brother!

302
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.860 line:80%
Do you know what Nandhi said?

303
00:17:51.735 --> 00:17:57.401 line:80%
The day a girl can happily shoot reels
on a cable bridge at midnight...

304
00:17:58.485 --> 00:18:00.693 line:80%
is the day we will be
truly independent.

305
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.485 line:80%
Nandhi talked about the cable bridge?

306
00:18:03.651 --> 00:18:04.818 line:80%
Rohul Nandhi!

307
00:18:04.901 --> 00:18:06.901 line:80%
Done. Tata!

308
00:18:21.818 --> 00:18:25.110 line:80%
If I find out you guys
are harassing women,

309
00:18:25.193 --> 00:18:26.943 line:80%
you won't celebrate your next birthday!

310
00:18:28.443 --> 00:18:29.360 line:80%
Let's go!

311
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.568 line:80%
I guess it's government property.

312
00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.776 line:80%
Find out if there's any damage.

313
00:18:34.068 --> 00:18:36.360 line:80%
-We'll pay it from the taxes.
-Let's Gpay.

314
00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:46.235 line:80%
-Thank you.
-It's okay!

315
00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:48.193 line:80%
My friend gets mad
if he sees a girl being harassed.

316
00:18:48.318 --> 00:18:50.151 line:80%
Because he wants to do it himself.

317
00:18:50.276 --> 00:18:51.735 line:80%
If you hadn't come...

318
00:18:51.776 --> 00:18:53.235 line:80%
-Someone would've come if you hadn't.
-Why will he come?

319
00:18:53.276 --> 00:18:54.943 line:80%
I'm here. Did I come?
No! I won't!

320
00:18:54.985 --> 00:18:56.235 line:80%
No one but him will come.

321
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.568 line:80%
Be careful. Leave.

322
00:18:57.651 --> 00:18:59.985 line:80%
Wait! Wait! The pink dress looks good!
Where did you buy it?

323
00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:01.568 line:80%
-From Gudiya?
-Yes.

324
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.360 line:80%
I knew it! Looks like you
got it for a 50% off! Bye!

325
00:19:04.568 --> 00:19:05.610 line:80%
Don't worry!

326
00:19:05.776 --> 00:19:07.401 line:80%
He'll take care of all the issues.

327
00:19:08.235 --> 00:19:10.568 line:80%
Even though the plan isn't great,
you have superb taste!

328
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:12.610 line:80%
She's not the one.
It's a different girl!

329
00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:13.860 line:80%
-Is it?
-Yes.

330
00:19:13.985 --> 00:19:15.735 line:80%
When those idiots said she
was not a
puri
but a punugu,

331
00:19:15.776 --> 00:19:16.776 line:80%
shouldn't my brain have lit up?

332
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.901 line:80%
It didn't. Why?

333
00:19:17.943 --> 00:19:19.860 line:80%
Hey, you've loved
punugulu
since childhood, right?

334
00:19:19.943 --> 00:19:21.026 line:80%
Why don't you say yes?

335
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:22.401 line:80%
That was when I was young.

336
00:19:22.485 --> 00:19:24.485 line:80%
I'm an adult now!

337
00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:26.193 line:80%
Only burgers!

338
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:29.693 line:80%
Pizzas, jalapenos, alapenos!

339
00:19:29.818 --> 00:19:31.776 line:80%
Salt and pepper packets must!

340
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.901 line:80%
-She looks gorgeous.
-Hey! Go away.

341
00:19:41.026 --> 00:19:42.526 line:80%
-She is the one, dude.
-Amazing!

342
00:19:42.568 --> 00:19:43.985 line:80%
She'll never fall for you.

343
00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:46.610 line:80%
Why?

344
00:19:46.693 --> 00:19:50.526 line:80%
A handsome man like me took two years
to win over a girl like Gayathri.

345
00:19:50.568 --> 00:19:53.401 line:80%
It'll take you a minimum of
eight years to win this girl's heart.

346
00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:56.860 line:80%
Do you know when? It'll happen only after
her kids start calling you uncle!

347
00:19:57.068 --> 00:19:58.026 line:80%
No.

348
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:01.026 line:80%
I feel like she's the one for me.

349
00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:04.235 line:80%
Does her mother have no job
other than giving birth to girls for you?

350
00:20:04.276 --> 00:20:08.026 line:80%
Every idiot says the same thing.
Look at her. She is glamorous.

351
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.485 line:80%
What do you have?

352
00:20:09.568 --> 00:20:11.276 line:80%
Apart from the old Hero Honda Glamour?

353
00:20:11.693 --> 00:20:13.651 line:80%
Don't you think I've fans for my glamour?

354
00:20:14.276 --> 00:20:15.151 line:80%
You do.

355
00:20:15.235 --> 00:20:17.818 line:80%
-You have humor.
-I'll win her over with humor. Watch!

356
00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:18.860 line:80%
In your dreams!

357
00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:20.276 line:80%
Let's be frank.

358
00:20:20.318 --> 00:20:23.026 line:80%
A girl that beautiful
will definitely have a boyfriend!

359
00:20:23.068 --> 00:20:25.235 line:80%
You know about us men!

360
00:20:25.276 --> 00:20:27.276 line:80%
My token number was 12 for Gayathri.

361
00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:31.068 line:80%
Oh my god! Token number 12
for that blanket-faced girl!

362
00:20:31.151 --> 00:20:32.651 line:80%
She's Miss Amberpet.

363
00:20:32.693 --> 00:20:34.526 line:80%
-The station is here. Come on.
-Wait!

364
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.235 line:80%
You made me doubt
if she has a boyfriend.

365
00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:37.901 line:80%
We'll check if he's really there.

366
00:20:39.735 --> 00:20:41.526 line:80%
I told you she has a boyfriend.

367
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.943 line:80%
He looks like a brother between
Salman Khan and Sohail Khan.

368
00:20:43.985 --> 00:20:45.318 line:80%
You should just drop out!

369
00:20:45.485 --> 00:20:47.651 line:80%
Hey! Let's follow them home
and find out.

370
00:20:55.943 --> 00:20:58.318 line:80%
-They're chatting away happily.
-They could be cousins.

371
00:20:59.068 --> 00:21:00.610 line:80%
Would cousins laugh this much?

372
00:21:00.651 --> 00:21:02.735 line:80%
-They must be in-laws.
-I hope he's wrong.

373
00:21:02.818 --> 00:21:05.651 line:80%
Oh, Lord!
Watch over me.

374
00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:11.193 line:80%
Thank you! Scan, please!

375
00:21:13.401 --> 00:21:16.235 line:80%
Who came up with using
Royal Enfield for Happido rides?

376
00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.110 line:80%
I guess he's a nepo kid with self-respect.

377
00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:19.860 line:80%
-Can you give me a 5-star rating?
-Yeah. Sure.

378
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:20.860 line:80%
I'll give you a ten star rating.

379
00:21:20.943 --> 00:21:22.235 line:80%
He's gone already.

380
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.318 line:80%
This is the way
to my mother-in-law's home!

381
00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.943 line:80%
Go! They'll serve you
sarvapindi.

382
00:21:28.068 --> 00:21:30.193 line:80%
I'll go at an auspicious time.
Today is no moon day!

383
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:33.151 line:80%
Purva, dear?
Come, let's eat.

384
00:21:33.318 --> 00:21:34.776 line:80%
Yeah! I'm coming.

385
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:37.735 line:80%
Oh no! Mom!

386
00:21:43.776 --> 00:21:47.235 line:80%
I begged you not to do
any chores before your surgery.

387
00:21:47.318 --> 00:21:49.360 line:80%
Mom! The insurance got approved.

388
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.860 line:80%
We can get your surgery done
once I arrange the remaining amount.

389
00:21:52.985 --> 00:21:54.610 line:80%
I've already sold four cars.

390
00:21:54.943 --> 00:21:58.526 line:80%
If I sell two more,
I'll get an incentive. We can use that.

391
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.193 line:80%
Okay. Eat up.

392
00:22:03.651 --> 00:22:07.026 line:80%
-What's the curry?
-Mom made chickpea curry.

393
00:22:07.276 --> 00:22:10.693 line:80%
Oh, my Jolly Joseph!
Be careful! You might die.

394
00:22:10.776 --> 00:22:11.860 line:80%
What about yours?

395
00:22:11.901 --> 00:22:13.568 line:80%
What's he doing?
Using Bumble?

396
00:22:13.985 --> 00:22:14.818 line:80%
Me?

397
00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:18.318 line:80%
I've got liver fry from
Kumari aunty...

398
00:22:18.485 --> 00:22:21.235 line:80%
They gave me two extra pieces
when I mentioned your name.

399
00:22:21.276 --> 00:22:22.526 line:80%
What else?

400
00:22:22.943 --> 00:22:24.151 line:80%
Get lost!

401
00:22:24.901 --> 00:22:28.235 line:80%
-Okay. What's Vijay up to?
-He's focusing on his career.

402
00:22:28.276 --> 00:22:31.443 line:80%
Time stops while speaking to you.

403
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.735 line:80%
Your watch isn't working?
It's a cringe joke!

404
00:22:36.318 --> 00:22:37.401 line:80%
Look, baby!

405
00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:39.193 line:80%
You're meeting my friends tomorrow,

406
00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:40.901 line:80%
so come clean shaved.

407
00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:42.693 line:80%
Don't wear a T-shirt, baby.

408
00:22:42.818 --> 00:22:44.485 line:80%
Your paunch is showing.

409
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.943 line:80%
If I wear a hoody,
even my head won't show.

410
00:22:47.026 --> 00:22:48.735 line:80%
It's a cringe joke again.

411
00:22:49.943 --> 00:22:51.526 line:80%
Okay. Good night.

412
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:54.735 line:80%
What are you thinking about so deeply?

413
00:22:55.193 --> 00:22:58.026 line:80%
It's now confirmed that Purva
doesn't have a boyfriend.

414
00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:01.360 line:80%
I'm thinking where to go
on our honeymoon.

415
00:23:01.568 --> 00:23:03.068 line:80%
You mean...

416
00:23:03.735 --> 00:23:06.485 line:80%
Just because no one picks her up,
you say she's single?

417
00:23:06.735 --> 00:23:08.776 line:80%
He may have dropped her off.
How would you know?

418
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.276 line:80%
You idiot!

419
00:23:10.526 --> 00:23:14.276 line:80%
Girls without a boyfriend,
and guys not on Bumble, were never real.

420
00:23:14.985 --> 00:23:18.068 line:80%
-Washing face with milk...
-Where have you been?

421
00:23:18.526 --> 00:23:20.026 line:80%
You asked for curd right?

422
00:23:20.068 --> 00:23:21.735 line:80%
-Gayathri!
-Gayathri?

423
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:23.235 line:80%
-Hospital!
-Hospital?

424
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.860 line:80%
Gayathri's in the hospital?

425
00:23:24.943 --> 00:23:26.568 line:80%
I don't need this
Korean mask anymore.

426
00:23:26.735 --> 00:23:29.401 line:80%
Let's go!
Because she's so sturdy and healthy,

427
00:23:29.443 --> 00:23:31.193 line:80%
I didn't even get her health insurance.

428
00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:33.443 line:80%
She wanted to introduce me
to her friends.

429
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.693 line:80%
That's why I was sleeping with
a face mask on.

430
00:23:36.068 --> 00:23:37.776 line:80%
Everyone who saw me would say,

431
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:40.110 line:80%
"He's so handsome. Like a hero!"

432
00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:42.443 line:80%
I wanted to see the happiness in her eyes.

433
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.110 line:80%
She's my girl!

434
00:23:44.193 --> 00:23:45.985 line:80%
-She's my girl...
-We know she's your girl, man!

435
00:23:46.026 --> 00:23:47.401 line:80%
Don't move. We may fall.

436
00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:49.526 line:80%
Oh no!
Are we here?

437
00:23:49.735 --> 00:23:51.151 line:80%
Hey, hey!

438
00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:53.068 line:80%
Why did you stop here?

439
00:23:54.068 --> 00:23:56.485 line:80%
This is a matter of life and death!
Gayathri?

440
00:23:56.526 --> 00:23:59.651 line:80%
You said her boyfriend might
drop her off, didn't you?

441
00:23:59.776 --> 00:24:02.151 line:80%
That's why I came to check
if Purva has a boyfriend.

442
00:24:02.401 --> 00:24:03.776 line:80%
But Gayathri? Hospital?

443
00:24:03.901 --> 00:24:05.401 line:80%
There! That's Gayathri Hospital.

444
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.235 line:80%
Oh! Did you think
your Gayathri was in the hospital?

445
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.693 line:80%
If she was in the hospital,
why would I get the news before you?

446
00:24:15.235 --> 00:24:18.068 line:80%
I suspected this would be a prank
when I didn't tear up earlier!

447
00:24:18.151 --> 00:24:20.901 line:80%
If I ever hear you utter
Gayathri's sacred name again,

448
00:24:20.943 --> 00:24:22.860 line:80%
I'll strangle you
in your sleep, you fool!

449
00:24:25.901 --> 00:24:27.193 line:80%
Hey,
coolie!

450
00:24:27.276 --> 00:24:29.443 line:80%
-Not you, that
coolie!
-Your cousin's calling.

451
00:24:29.485 --> 00:24:32.568 line:80%
-I'll pay you 500 rupees per day.
-You stout Buckingham Palace!

452
00:24:32.693 --> 00:24:34.068 line:80%
You think
coolies
are that cheap?

453
00:24:34.318 --> 00:24:37.151 line:80%
Lokesh Kanagaraj's movie is also titled
Coolie.
Rajnikanth is the hero.

454
00:24:37.235 --> 00:24:38.943 line:80%
Let's go. This guy sounds crazy.

455
00:24:40.318 --> 00:24:42.818 line:80%
-Did they ask you to work as a
coolie?
-Get lost!

456
00:24:43.068 --> 00:24:44.860 line:80%
-Shut up!
-You should give it a try once.

457
00:24:44.943 --> 00:24:46.943 line:80%
-I'll say this for the last tim--
-Do you know masonry work?

458
00:24:47.068 --> 00:24:50.235 line:80%
2,000 rupees per day,
plus biriyani for lunch. Interested?

459
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.401 line:80%
Get in!

460
00:24:51.485 --> 00:24:53.068 line:80%
-Sit in the back!
-I'll sit in the front!

461
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.651 line:80%
-Hey! Don't bite him.
-Have you gone nuts?

462
00:24:54.693 --> 00:24:55.943 line:80%
Stop, you idiot.

463
00:24:55.985 --> 00:24:57.568 line:80%
-I'm a bank employee!
-Leave me!

464
00:24:57.735 --> 00:24:59.110 line:80%
I'm a freaking bank employee!

465
00:25:00.485 --> 00:25:03.610 line:80%
He said 2,000 rupees per day.
Isn't that more than your salary?

466
00:25:03.651 --> 00:25:05.360 line:80%
Why don't you give it a thought?

467
00:25:05.443 --> 00:25:07.401 line:80%
Ugh! I should have
cut him off in the childhood itself.

468
00:25:07.485 --> 00:25:09.276 line:80%
Hey! Purva!

469
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.901 line:80%
She came alone.

470
00:25:10.943 --> 00:25:13.860 line:80%
-Come on, come on.
-My clothes! The
lungi,
you idiot!

471
00:25:14.026 --> 00:25:16.526 line:80%
I just called to check if you're
ready to initiate the payment.

472
00:25:16.568 --> 00:25:19.193 line:80%
If you can do it at the earliest,
we can give you some--

473
00:25:19.276 --> 00:25:21.276 line:80%
Hey! It's Gayathri.
Shall I hang up?

474
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.360 line:80%
You're going to mess everything up!
I'm supposed to meet her friends today.

475
00:25:24.818 --> 00:25:27.026 line:80%
Hi, Bumblebee! How are you?

476
00:25:27.068 --> 00:25:28.776 line:80%
I'm good. Where are you?

477
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:34.026 line:80%
Uh... Vijay is not feeling well.
So I brought him to a hospital.

478
00:25:34.068 --> 00:25:36.068 line:80%
You noisy crow.
She's brought her whole flock along!

479
00:25:36.151 --> 00:25:38.568 line:80%
-Which hospital? Gayathri Hospital!
-He's finished.

480
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.818 line:80%
-Oh really?
-Hey! It's Gayathri, dude!

481
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.151 line:80%
Oh no! What happened?

482
00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:45.276 line:80%
He ate chicken yesterday and
got Chicken pox.

483
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.026 line:80%
-Tell your friends I'm sorry.
-Do it yourself.

484
00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:51.485 line:80%
Me? How can I tell them directly?

485
00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:52.526 line:80%
Like that.

486
00:25:54.985 --> 00:25:56.776 line:80%
Gayathri, I'll call you back. I love you.

487
00:25:57.776 --> 00:25:59.401 line:80%
Seems like KPHB batch.

488
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.943 line:80%
Like the airport look,
this is a metro look.

489
00:26:01.985 --> 00:26:04.860 line:80%
You look like Salman Khan in this outfit!

490
00:26:04.943 --> 00:26:06.610 line:80%
Hey, you're kidding, right?

491
00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:08.360 line:80%
This is the guy you fell for?

492
00:26:08.485 --> 00:26:12.818 line:80%
Besides his bank job, does he
also clean septic tanks part-time?

493
00:26:12.901 --> 00:26:14.276 line:80%
Hey, that's enough!

494
00:26:14.485 --> 00:26:16.443 line:80%
You guys are just
the friends of a side character,

495
00:26:16.485 --> 00:26:17.651 line:80%
yet you act so high and mighty!

496
00:26:17.693 --> 00:26:19.860 line:80%
He's a full-fledged
side character himself!

497
00:26:19.943 --> 00:26:21.235 line:80%
Just imagine his attitude!

498
00:26:21.401 --> 00:26:23.985 line:80%
He may look like a guy who
hangs out at IMAX, reviewing movies,

499
00:26:24.026 --> 00:26:27.151 line:80%
but he's actually a B-grade
employee at SDFC Bank!

500
00:26:27.235 --> 00:26:30.276 line:80%
-It's grade B.
-B-grade? Wow!

501
00:26:30.318 --> 00:26:32.693 line:80%
-Gayathri. Actually, baby...
-Stop it!

502
00:26:32.985 --> 00:26:35.193 line:80%
-I hate you.
-I love you. I love you!

503
00:26:35.235 --> 00:26:37.485 line:80%
-Bumblebee! I love you.
-Please! Let's go, girls!

504
00:26:37.568 --> 00:26:40.526 line:80%
-Wait, dude! Hey!
-Gayathri! Gayathri!

505
00:26:40.651 --> 00:26:42.235 line:80%
Let them go. They'll come back.

506
00:26:42.401 --> 00:26:44.901 line:80%
Why are you laughing?
Have you never seen anyone in a
lungi?

507
00:26:44.985 --> 00:26:48.485 line:80%
Lungi
is a big part of Tamil Nadu's
culture! "Mersal" was all about it!

508
00:26:48.526 --> 00:26:50.401 line:80%
Their culture is to wear it, buddy.
Not walking around without it!

509
00:26:50.443 --> 00:26:52.235 line:80%
When did I...
Oh no!

510
00:26:52.318 --> 00:26:54.235 line:80%
Hey! Nothing has happened yet.
Don't jump.

511
00:26:54.318 --> 00:26:55.568 line:80%
Oh shit!

512
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.568 line:80%
Hey! What are you staring at?
Turn away! It's nothing special.

513
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.193 line:80%
Since when did you
start wearing underwear?

514
00:27:04.235 --> 00:27:06.693 line:80%
You need to cover it below.
Cover it below, dude!

515
00:27:06.735 --> 00:27:08.776 line:80%
You should cover up.
What if they take pics and upload them?

516
00:27:08.776 --> 00:27:09.193 line:80%
What if they take pics and upload them?

517
00:27:12.735 --> 00:27:13.735 line:80%
Hey! Close that.

518
00:27:15.526 --> 00:27:16.360 line:80%
Sit right here.

519
00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:19.401 line:80%
If you come in looking like this,
Purva might think I'm crazy like you!

520
00:27:19.485 --> 00:27:21.776 line:80%
Got it? They're selling underwear
under that tree. Buy one.

521
00:27:21.818 --> 00:27:23.735 line:80%
But in a larger size.
I can't stand the sight of it.

522
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.901 line:80%
You need one, too. Take that.
Give that to him.

523
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.110 line:80%
Excuse me.

524
00:27:28.193 --> 00:27:29.110 line:80%
Hi, sir.

525
00:27:29.151 --> 00:27:30.568 line:80%
-How can I help you?
-Audi, Audi.

526
00:27:30.776 --> 00:27:32.193 line:80%
Okay, sir. Please be seated.

527
00:27:32.235 --> 00:27:34.651 line:80%
-I'll call my executive. She'll explain.
-Thank you.

528
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.943 line:80%
Yeah! Please

529
00:27:47.818 --> 00:27:48.860 line:80%
Hey! Please!

530
00:27:52.276 --> 00:27:53.318 line:80%
Hey! Hey!

531
00:27:55.901 --> 00:27:57.151 line:80%
Hey! Hey!

532
00:28:02.318 --> 00:28:03.526 line:80%
I'll kill you my...

533
00:28:03.568 --> 00:28:04.860 line:80%
-Sir, where are you going?
-Khansar seal here.

534
00:28:04.901 --> 00:28:06.026 line:80%
You dare to stop me?

535
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.318 line:80%
Hey! Didn't I tell you
not to come inside?

536
00:28:13.943 --> 00:28:15.568 line:80%
-Hey!
-Sorry, should I remove it?

537
00:28:15.651 --> 00:28:16.776 line:80%
-Tie it.
-Tie it?

538
00:28:16.901 --> 00:28:17.818 line:80%
-Hey!
-Come on.

539
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.526 line:80%
-Anybody there?
-Don't shout, dude.

540
00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:25.860 line:80%
-First deal of the day is here!
-Hey, Purva's coming.

541
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.443 line:80%
Wow! What a complexion!

542
00:28:31.276 --> 00:28:32.485 line:80%
Hi, sir. I'm Purva.

543
00:28:32.818 --> 00:28:35.568 line:80%
-Hi! I'm Vijay, SDFC Bank Manager.
-Nice to meet you.

544
00:28:35.818 --> 00:28:37.610 line:80%
-Okay.
-I'm Bala from Shambala.

545
00:28:37.776 --> 00:28:39.568 line:80%
-My friend is a special kid.
-Hi!

546
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:40.568 line:80%
He's my father.

547
00:28:40.943 --> 00:28:43.818 line:80%
-Notice the vibration in the name Purva?
-Even the name sounds broke, dude.

548
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.110 line:80%
Shut up, you negative fellow!

549
00:28:45.193 --> 00:28:47.318 line:80%
So... what's your budget?

550
00:28:47.485 --> 00:28:49.276 line:80%
-Is there any specific--
-Legs off!

551
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.651 line:80%
Is this a cot to stretch out on?

552
00:28:52.235 --> 00:28:54.026 line:80%
Which model are you considering, sir?

553
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.693 line:80%
Model? Uh...

554
00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:57.068 line:80%
She's asking which model you want.

555
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.985 line:80%
Did you come to check her out or the car?

556
00:29:00.026 --> 00:29:01.110 line:80%
Q series.

557
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.401 line:80%
-For you?
-No. For my brother.

558
00:29:05.235 --> 00:29:07.276 line:80%
Not him. My brother in the US.

559
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.151 line:80%
-I heard he lost his job.
-So what?

560
00:29:09.193 --> 00:29:11.318 line:80%
He's making good money in distribution.

561
00:29:11.485 --> 00:29:14.026 line:80%
This is the latest model.
Check it out.

562
00:29:14.068 --> 00:29:16.568 line:80%
-It also has Wi-Fi.
-Oh, it has Wi-Fi?

563
00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:17.776 line:80%
What's the password?

564
00:29:18.735 --> 00:29:20.068 line:80%
Does it have AC?

565
00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:22.026 line:80%
Is it a split AC or central AC?

566
00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:23.485 line:80%
Do we need to fill water?

567
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.610 line:80%
-We have a water problem, dude!
-Not in Jubilee Hills.

568
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:28.360 line:80%
This is an Audi car.
It's a high-end model.

569
00:29:28.443 --> 00:29:30.401 line:80%
Ma'am, I know this is an Audi car.

570
00:29:30.526 --> 00:29:33.443 line:80%
I'm talking about
the showroom AC. It's very hot!

571
00:29:33.485 --> 00:29:34.568 line:80%
She might fall for me.

572
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.235 line:80%
Don't get any closer.
She may faint.

573
00:29:36.276 --> 00:29:39.693 line:80%
-Would you like a test drive, sir?
-No, no, no test drives.

574
00:29:39.776 --> 00:29:41.151 line:80%
I guess he can't drive.

575
00:29:41.235 --> 00:29:43.860 line:80%
Who are you?
Are you the car and floor cleaner?

576
00:29:43.985 --> 00:29:45.610 line:80%
Bring us two coffees.
Please go.

577
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:47.693 line:80%
-So, do you like this car?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

578
00:29:47.735 --> 00:29:49.360 line:80%
What's its mileage? 30 kmpl?

579
00:29:49.443 --> 00:29:51.526 line:80%
Is it an Ape auto to give you 30kmpl?

580
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.901 line:80%
-It's an Audi.
-Six kmpl.

581
00:29:53.985 --> 00:29:55.943 line:80%
Six?! Six is my lucky number!

582
00:29:56.026 --> 00:29:56.901 line:80%
I like that number.

583
00:29:56.943 --> 00:29:58.235 line:80%
Is that per liter or half a liter?

584
00:29:58.568 --> 00:30:00.401 line:80%
Who measures mileage
for half a liter, sir?

585
00:30:00.485 --> 00:30:01.985 line:80%
Are you really here to buy a car?

586
00:30:02.026 --> 00:30:03.443 line:80%
Nice voice! You should insure it.

587
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.068 line:80%
If you'd dubbed for Sai Pallavi,
Thandel
would've been a disaster.

588
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.235 line:80%
This is making me feel confused.

589
00:30:08.401 --> 00:30:11.068 line:80%
It'd be helpful if you explain in live
for better understanding...

590
00:30:11.151 --> 00:30:12.568 line:80%
-Please come.
-Planning to flirt with her in the car?

591
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.026 line:80%
It's nice to talk to Purva.
Please don't disturb this, dude.

592
00:30:15.068 --> 00:30:17.151 line:80%
Don't you remember what
you did with Gayatri?

593
00:30:17.235 --> 00:30:18.235 line:80%
-Do you remember?
-Yeah. I remember.

594
00:30:18.485 --> 00:30:19.151 line:80%
I won't do it again.

595
00:30:19.193 --> 00:30:20.693 line:80%
-Promise me you won't do it!
-Promise!

596
00:30:20.776 --> 00:30:21.901 line:80%
Don't lift the
lungi.

597
00:30:22.276 --> 00:30:24.485 line:80%
Miss Purva. I'm a huge Audi fan.

598
00:30:24.735 --> 00:30:26.443 line:80%
I wanted to gift it to my wife
after our wedding.

599
00:30:26.568 --> 00:30:29.235 line:80%
I earn two lakh rupees per month
as an Executive Manager at SDFC.

600
00:30:29.401 --> 00:30:31.485 line:80%
-Oh! That's nice.
-I don't have many expenses as I'm single.

601
00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:32.901 line:80%
That's why I'm here.

602
00:30:32.943 --> 00:30:35.235 line:80%
I recently shortlisted a flat in Bhuja.

603
00:30:35.276 --> 00:30:37.360 line:80%
I must ensure all kinds of
comforts for my future partner.

604
00:30:37.443 --> 00:30:39.776 line:80%
All my friends tell me I'm very lucky!

605
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.443 line:80%
Just recently...

606
00:30:41.526 --> 00:30:43.818 line:80%
You know what an astrologer
told me recently?

607
00:30:43.985 --> 00:30:46.568 line:80%
That my future wife's name
would start with P.

608
00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:50.193 line:80%
I don't usually believe in these things,
but this time, I really want to.

609
00:30:50.693 --> 00:30:53.193 line:80%
Parvathi... bring two cups of coffee.

610
00:30:53.401 --> 00:30:55.526 line:80%
-Who is Parvathi?
-The worker.

611
00:30:55.651 --> 00:30:58.943 line:80%
Oh! Nice sense of humor!

612
00:30:58.985 --> 00:31:00.110 line:80%

-Oh, Purva.

00:31:22.985 --> 00:31:26.235 line:80%
Your details are too detailed!
I think it is because of your sweet voice.

-Yeah, that's right.

What's the initial payment on this car?

620
00:31:35.151 --> 00:31:36.401 line:80%
What will be my discount?

621
00:31:36.443 --> 00:31:38.193 line:80%

WhatsApp,

622

These days in the US,

632

Telugu movie distribution is booming

Sir. So, your brother
liked the car, didn't he?

655

Why the formalities?
Call me Vijay.

Okay. Vijay!

657
00:33:03.318 --> 00:33:06.360 line:80%
So, Vijay! The initial payment
is just five lakhs.

658

Oh! Five lakhs?

659
00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:10.193 line:80%
Yeah! And in two weeks,
your car will be delivered.

Two weeks?
Nice! Nice!

-No, no.

Do you see that guy?

664
00:33:16.485 --> 00:33:19.193 line:80%
He borrowed five lakhs from me
last week, saying it was urgent.

665
00:33:19.318 --> 00:33:22.026 line:80%
I wanted to ask him, but he's my friend.
So, I'm hesitant to ask.

666
00:33:22.193 --> 00:33:23.610 line:80%
I haven't even told my brother about this.

667
00:33:23.693 --> 00:33:27.735 line:80%
But I'll figure out the right time
to get the money from him this week.

668
00:33:27.818 --> 00:33:29.735 line:80%
As soon as I get the money,
I'll make the payment.

669
00:33:29.776 --> 00:33:31.193 line:80%
Okay. No problem.

I have now confirmed that she's single!

Once we're settled in love,
we can go abroad--

00:33:38.526 --> 00:33:42.985 line:80%
A strong coffee with regular sugar.

-Hey! The smoke is good.
-Hey, why are you wasting the cigarette?

674
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:53.985 line:80%
It's tough to quit smoking
and drinking while on this job.

675
00:33:54.068 --> 00:33:55.276 line:80%
You can go home and
return in the gap.

I'll be back in two minutes.

Hey, Vijay, you're falling behind.

How did you know
I was after that girl, sir?

Hey, I'm not talking about girls.

I'm talking about your job performance.

682

Hey!

683
00:34:17.735 --> 00:34:19.735 line:80%
-I'm still going to give you a chance.
-Please, sir.

684
00:34:19.818 --> 00:34:22.693 line:80%
We received an inquiry for
a ten lakh policy.

685
00:34:22.735 --> 00:34:24.693 line:80%
I'm sending you
the details on WhatsApp.

686
00:34:24.776 --> 00:34:26.443 line:80%
You both go and get it.

687
00:34:26.485 --> 00:34:28.026 line:80%
-Done.
-Okay, sir.

688
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.901 line:80%
Why would anyone
take a policy during a wedding?

689
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.068 line:80%
They probably want the groom to get one.

690
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.610 line:80%
They're killing people
with life insurance.

691
00:34:34.735 --> 00:34:36.068 line:80%
-Huh?!
-Women!

692
00:34:37.651 --> 00:34:40.610 line:80%
She doesn't answer my call.
But this stupid girl asks me to come.

693
00:34:40.651 --> 00:34:42.026 line:80%
I feel too shy to attend functions.

Not heart attack.

758
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.693 line:80%
Heartbreak.

759
00:38:26.901 --> 00:38:28.693 line:80%
We don't provide insurance
for heartbreaks at all.

00:38:36.526 --> 00:38:38.443 line:80%
-Why're you standing in the hot sun?
-Sir?

765
00:38:38.568 --> 00:38:40.568 line:80%
Your skin will be tanned like him.

766
00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.610 line:80%
Come, I'll drop you.

767
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:43.568 line:80%
-No, no. It's okay, sir.
-Hey, come.

768
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:45.193 line:80%
Get off.
Take this bag.

769
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.860 line:80%
-You come. Come on!
-It's okay, sir. I'll...

770
00:38:47.943 --> 00:38:50.193 line:80%
Hey! I can't balance on one side.

771
00:38:50.235 --> 00:38:52.276 line:80%
-Put legs on both sides.
-Let me hold it for you.

772
00:38:52.318 --> 00:38:53.735 line:80%
Don't disturb me for one hour.

773
00:38:53.901 --> 00:38:56.401 line:80%
-Don't be jealous, dude!
-Put this in between.

774
00:38:56.735 --> 00:38:59.360 line:80%
Trust Happidos but not desperados.

775
00:38:59.401 --> 00:39:01.568 line:80%
Go home and cook some rice.
I'll see you there.

776
00:39:55.235 --> 00:39:57.526 line:80%
-I don't understand a single word.
-We only know coffee.

777
00:39:57.568 --> 00:39:59.276 line:80%
-How much for the coffee?
-It's two fifty rupees, sir.

778
00:39:59.401 --> 00:40:00.818 line:80%
Two cups for fifty rupees?

779
00:40:01.485 --> 00:40:02.818 line:80%
Bring me two.

780
00:40:03.485 --> 00:40:04.526 line:80%
Hello!

781
00:40:04.651 --> 00:40:07.526 line:80%
Not two for fifty.
It's two hundred and fifty per cup.

782
00:40:08.151 --> 00:40:10.610 line:80%
-Yes, sir.
-Then make it a one-by-two cup.

783
00:40:10.776 --> 00:40:11.943 line:80%
Sorry, sir.

784
00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.401 line:80%
-We don't offer one-by-two servings.
-You don't?

785
00:40:14.901 --> 00:40:16.235 line:80%
-Get lost!
-I'll order later.

786
00:40:16.276 --> 00:40:17.526 line:80%
I didn't come with him.

787
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.443 line:80%
-Pick one of these two fingers.
-Why?

788
00:40:20.526 --> 00:40:21.943 line:80%
Should I say "I love you"
after telling the truth?

789
00:40:21.985 --> 00:40:23.568 line:80%
Or should I tell the truth
after saying "I love you"?

790
00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.610 line:80%
Whatever you say,
tell the truth, dude.

791
00:40:25.818 --> 00:40:28.443 line:80%
Because girls like boys
who admit their mistakes

792
00:40:28.485 --> 00:40:30.193 line:80%
more than those who brag.

793
00:40:31.443 --> 00:40:32.901 line:80%
She's coming. Be careful.

794
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.818 line:80%
They said, "Speak a thousand truths
and break a marriage." He's finished.

795
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.901 line:80%
-Hi. Purva.
-Hi!

796
00:40:42.026 --> 00:40:43.276 line:80%
-Take your seat.
-Thank you.

797
00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:47.693 line:80%
-Hey, Kenya!
-Sir?

798
00:40:48.235 --> 00:40:49.068 line:80%
Come.

799
00:40:49.318 --> 00:40:51.818 line:80%
-Coffee here is so good. I like it.
-Yes, sir.

800
00:40:52.443 --> 00:40:53.735 line:80%
Two cups of coffee.

801
00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.818 line:80%
Sir, we don't offer
one-by-two servings here.

802
00:40:56.943 --> 00:40:58.568 line:80%
One is 250 rupees.
Fixed price.

803
00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.276 line:80%
Hey... do I look like someone
who drinks a one-by-two cup?

804
00:41:01.776 --> 00:41:05.610 line:80%
Two cups of coffee.
Two cups and two saucers. Bring! Get lost!

805
00:41:05.693 --> 00:41:06.735 line:80%
Kenya!

806
00:41:09.318 --> 00:41:10.235 line:80%
Purva!

807
00:41:10.943 --> 00:41:13.026 line:80%
Why do you seem so dull?
Are you hungry?

808
00:41:13.151 --> 00:41:14.318 line:80%
Shall I order some snacks?

809
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.485 line:80%
Vijay, I have been following up
with you for two weeks now.

810
00:41:17.735 --> 00:41:21.151 line:80%
You're talking about
everything except the car.

811
00:41:21.235 --> 00:41:23.276 line:80%
Don't think I'm pressuring you.

812
00:41:23.443 --> 00:41:25.943 line:80%
I've got my own commitments
based on your purchase.

813
00:41:26.026 --> 00:41:30.568 line:80%
If you tell me clearly when
you'll buy the car, I'll plan accordingly.

814
00:41:33.276 --> 00:41:34.485 line:80%
Actually, Purva...

815
00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:37.485 line:80%
you can lie a thousand times
to get married, as per our elders.

816
00:41:38.318 --> 00:41:41.068 line:80%
But the problem here is that we must
tell many lies in the name of love.

817
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:43.151 line:80%
-I don't like lying.
-Excuse me, sir.

818
00:41:43.235 --> 00:41:45.526 line:80%
This good-for-nothing guy
drops at the right time!

819
00:41:45.776 --> 00:41:50.943 line:80%
Purva, I saw you on the train fifteen
days ago, I fell for you instantly.

820
00:41:51.943 --> 00:41:53.360 line:80%
I feared that
if I came and proposed,

821
00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:56.443 line:80%
you would say,
"Sorry, brother, I'm committed."

822
00:41:56.568 --> 00:42:00.735 line:80%
I told a small lie about
purchasing a car and stuff like that.

823
00:42:03.985 --> 00:42:05.485 line:80%
Are you even human?

824
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:09.360 line:80%
How dare you mess with a girl's job?
Aren't you ashamed?

825
00:42:11.318 --> 00:42:12.651 line:80%
-Let's sit and--
-Stop it.

826
00:42:12.985 --> 00:42:15.610 line:80%
If I hadn't asked you today,
you would've kept me chasing you.

827
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:17.776 line:80%
Don't you have common sense?

828
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.568 line:80%
You have a job too.
How could you cheat someone?

829
00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:21.693 line:80%
You are a fraud!

830
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.360 line:80%
Alright. Let us sit and talk.
Two minutes.

831
00:42:24.526 --> 00:42:27.610 line:80%
Had you been in my place,
you would've understood my pain.

832
00:42:29.443 --> 00:42:31.110 line:80%
-Game over!
-I'm honest.

833
00:42:31.693 --> 00:42:33.068 line:80%
That's why
I told the truth.

834
00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.401 line:80%
Did everyone watch what just happened now?

835
00:42:42.401 --> 00:42:43.651 line:80%
Why all this drama, dude?

836
00:42:43.735 --> 00:42:46.860 line:80%
That's why they say your prayers are
in vain when your respect is in the drain.

837
00:42:47.485 --> 00:42:49.026 line:80%
I will buy that Audi, dude.

838
00:42:49.193 --> 00:42:50.568 line:80%
I will deposit five lakhs this month,

839
00:42:50.651 --> 00:42:52.776 line:80%
pay sixty lakhs in six months,
and buy Audi, dude.

840
00:42:52.818 --> 00:42:54.235 line:80%
-I will buy it from her showroom.
-Sir!

841
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.068 line:80%
Your bill, sir?
It comes up to five hundred.

842
00:42:58.443 --> 00:42:59.651 line:80%
You're ripping me off by
five hundred rupees.

843
00:42:59.735 --> 00:43:00.610 line:80%
Can't you even put sugar in the coffee?

844
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:04.735 line:80%
Add another four hundred
and give it to me.

845
00:43:04.776 --> 00:43:05.860 line:80%
Keep this as a tip.

846
00:43:06.443 --> 00:43:08.026 line:80%
-I'll pay the bill.
-Okay, sir.

847
00:43:09.526 --> 00:43:11.151 line:80%
-Oh my god, not her again!
-Thank you, sir.

848
00:43:11.276 --> 00:43:12.985 line:80%
She's been nagging me about
the deposit for fifteen days now!

849
00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:15.026 line:80%
I'll handle her today.
Just wait. Come on.

850
00:43:25.026 --> 00:43:26.276 line:80%
Always with the dancing.

851
00:43:26.318 --> 00:43:27.985 line:80%
Don't her parents have
anything to say about that?

852
00:43:33.443 --> 00:43:34.985 line:80%
Hey, I'll be back in a minute.

853
00:43:35.985 --> 00:43:37.026 line:80%
Hey!

854
00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.276 line:80%
Let's sit over there and talk.

855
00:43:39.485 --> 00:43:40.526 line:80%
Let's go.

856
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:45.026 line:80%
Why do you seem dull, Vijay?

857
00:43:45.318 --> 00:43:46.443 line:80%
Harini...

858
00:43:47.235 --> 00:43:49.568 line:80%
we have been following up with you
about the policy for several weeks.

859
00:43:49.735 --> 00:43:51.776 line:80%
But instead of discussing the policy,

860
00:43:51.985 --> 00:43:54.360 line:80%
you're gossiping about everything else,
like an old woman at the market.

861
00:43:54.526 --> 00:43:56.568 line:80%
Please don't get me wrong
when I say it like this.

862
00:43:56.776 --> 00:43:58.735 line:80%
It's because we have
some targets to meet.

863
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.610 line:80%
We also have pressures from above.

864
00:44:01.901 --> 00:44:03.985 line:80%
If you tell me when you'll pay,
I can plan accordingly.

865
00:44:04.318 --> 00:44:05.443 line:80%
So please understand.

866
00:44:07.651 --> 00:44:11.485 line:80%
Having come this far,
I don't want to hide it anymore, Vijay.

867
00:44:12.193 --> 00:44:14.610 line:80%
My friend applied for
a housing loan at your bank.

868
00:44:14.776 --> 00:44:15.610 line:80%
Okay.

869
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:17.985 line:80%
After making her run around
the bank for four months...

870
00:44:18.068 --> 00:44:20.443 line:80%
they rejected the loan
at the last minute.

871
00:44:21.276 --> 00:44:23.860 line:80%
-Did you get it?
-If they had told her this sooner,

872
00:44:24.526 --> 00:44:26.485 line:80%
-things would have gone smoother.
-Right!

873
00:44:26.568 --> 00:44:29.360 line:80%
To ensure that your staff
understood that pain,

874
00:44:29.401 --> 00:44:32.735 line:80%
all of our friends approached
your bank manager.

875
00:44:33.401 --> 00:44:34.651 line:80%
But...

876
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.193 line:80%
I didn't expect you to show up.

877
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.401 line:80%
Didn't expect?
Are you even a woman?

878
00:44:45.443 --> 00:44:48.651 line:80%
You've turned two decent young men
with jobs into idiots, haven't you?

879
00:44:48.693 --> 00:44:50.235 line:80%
-It's not like that.
-Shut up.

880
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:52.943 line:80%
You told us only because we asked.
Or else?

881
00:44:53.026 --> 00:44:54.901 line:80%
You would have kept us
running around you like puppies.

882
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:57.068 line:80%
Oh my!

883
00:44:57.193 --> 00:44:59.360 line:80%
We should never trust these
Gen Z girls.

884
00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:03.485 line:80%
-If you are... in my...
-Place... property?

885
00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:05.485 line:80%
If you are in my property...

886
00:45:05.526 --> 00:45:06.568 line:80%
you'll know my pain.

887
00:45:06.693 --> 00:45:08.443 line:80%
Vijay...
Hey, V...

888
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.568 line:80%
-Come on, dude.
-Towel!

889
00:45:10.693 --> 00:45:12.860 line:80%
Put towel. Keep her warm.

890
00:45:18.026 --> 00:45:19.860 line:80%
What happened?
Why are you so sad?

891
00:45:20.068 --> 00:45:22.068 line:80%
I'll get the treatment done
when I have the money.

892
00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:23.901 line:80%
Come on.
Let's have some food.

893
00:45:30.068 --> 00:45:32.485 line:80%
I never thought he'd trick me, Mom.

894
00:45:32.693 --> 00:45:33.693 line:80%
Purva!

895
00:45:43.151 --> 00:45:45.151 line:80%
Knock, knock.
All good?

896
00:45:45.276 --> 00:45:46.151 line:80%
Hey!

897
00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:47.776 line:80%
I'm more handsome than you.

898
00:45:47.901 --> 00:45:50.276 line:80%
-Skin tone is a little better.
-I've got a better salary than you.

899
00:45:50.818 --> 00:45:53.068 line:80%
Even then, Gayatri fell for you.

900
00:45:53.235 --> 00:45:55.318 line:80%
But Purva rejected me.

901
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.860 line:80%
I don't think you're crying
because the girl scolded you.

902
00:45:57.943 --> 00:45:59.151 line:80%
It's like you are jealous of me.

903
00:45:59.235 --> 00:46:00.443 line:80%
-Hey!
-Sir.

904
00:46:01.193 --> 00:46:03.651 line:80%
Hey, Pakodi.
Give me two Balayya special bottles.

905
00:46:03.693 --> 00:46:04.193 line:80%
Okay, sir.

906
00:46:04.276 --> 00:46:07.151 line:80%
And two leg pieces fried in
Mahesh Babu brand oil.

907
00:46:07.276 --> 00:46:10.360 line:80%
And two bottles of water
with self-confidence in every drop.

908
00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.526 line:80%
-Take this.
-Hey, you can pay later.

909
00:46:12.568 --> 00:46:15.276 line:80%
We'll be drunk later.
What if they dupe us?

910
00:46:15.401 --> 00:46:16.318 line:80%
-Get going, Pakodi.
-Okay.

911
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.401 line:80%
Your aggressiveness suggests
that's my money.

912
00:46:18.568 --> 00:46:22.776 line:80%
-You're such a cheat.
-Come on. Out with it.

913
00:46:23.151 --> 00:46:24.693 line:80%
Hello, Srujana!

914
00:46:24.985 --> 00:46:26.151 line:80%
Did you eat?

915
00:46:26.401 --> 00:46:27.318 line:80%
Hello?

916
00:46:27.401 --> 00:46:28.485 line:80%
Hey, Srujana?

917
00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:29.526 line:80%
Hello?

918
00:46:29.568 --> 00:46:31.443 line:80%
-You, Srujana!
-Go away, you!

919
00:46:32.193 --> 00:46:33.568 line:80%
Did you eat at all?

920
00:46:33.651 --> 00:46:35.193 line:80%
I'm boozing because of her.

921
00:46:35.276 --> 00:46:36.360 line:80%
Never drank like this.

922
00:46:36.485 --> 00:46:37.360 line:80%
Is it Harini?

923
00:46:37.485 --> 00:46:40.318 line:80%
-No! It's Purva.
-Oh, sorry.

924
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.276 line:80%
Wait. Let me mix some water.

925
00:46:42.401 --> 00:46:44.318 line:80%
Roamed around so much for her.

926
00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:46.110 line:80%
How could she cheat us?

927
00:46:46.193 --> 00:46:47.360 line:80%
-Purva?
-Harini!

928
00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:48.318 line:80%
Sorry, sorry!

929
00:46:48.443 --> 00:46:51.943 line:80%
Usually, girls fall for a guy's looks
or his wealth.

930
00:46:52.151 --> 00:46:54.985 line:80%
But I've come to realize.
They also fall for stupidity.

931
00:46:55.818 --> 00:46:58.610 line:80%
-Don't mind me asking. Harini or Purva?
-Gayathri, dude.

932
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:00.818 line:80%
-Gayathri?
-She fell for you.

933
00:47:01.026 --> 00:47:04.235 line:80%
Just like switching metro trains
at the Ameerpet station,

934
00:47:04.276 --> 00:47:06.818 line:80%
why do you bring up Gayathri
for every damn topic in the world?

935
00:47:06.943 --> 00:47:11.026 line:80%
How is Harini telling me
the same things I tell Purva?

936
00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.776 line:80%
It's because you both are cheaters.

937
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.651 line:80%
The frequency might have matched.

938
00:47:15.735 --> 00:47:17.818 line:80%
Actually, Harini is the right person
to you.

939
00:47:17.943 --> 00:47:19.276 line:80%
Like eaters club,

940
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.776 line:80%
you can start a cheaters club.

941
00:47:20.818 --> 00:47:23.360 line:80%
-Have you eaten or not? Tell me.
-She will eat.

942
00:47:23.443 --> 00:47:25.318 line:80%
Or if she'll die.

943
00:47:26.235 --> 00:47:28.026 line:80%
-Get lost!
-I think this guy is single, Srujana.

944
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.068 line:80%
Bro!

945
00:47:29.193 --> 00:47:30.985 line:80%

Hey! Hey! Hey!

975
00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:22.485 line:80%
You were upset that you had
coffee thrown in your face.

976
00:50:22.526 --> 00:50:24.568 line:80%
You were sad that the
stink never went away.

977
00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:26.693 line:80%
You are back at it! Why?

978
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:30.735 line:80%
You took me to the
bar to forget everything.

979
00:50:31.235 --> 00:50:32.443 line:80%
Then, you haven't forgotten.

980
00:50:32.985 --> 00:50:34.568 line:80%
I forgot that it happened yesterday.

981
00:50:34.693 --> 00:50:36.401 line:80%
That's why I'm back afresh!

982
00:50:37.318 --> 00:50:38.651 line:80%
Why did you get me here?

983
00:50:39.318 --> 00:50:42.776 line:80%
Hey! Yesterday, it was almost
conveyed that I love Purva.

984
00:50:43.068 --> 00:50:46.151 line:80%
If she takes it seriously, it means
she doesn't have feelings.

985
00:50:46.526 --> 00:50:50.110 line:80%
If she goes away without saying
anything, she could have some feelings.

986
00:50:51.485 --> 00:50:52.943 line:80%
And if she doesn't have any feelings?

987
00:50:53.026 --> 00:50:55.693 line:80%
I'll create the feelings, Zimbabwe!

988
00:50:57.193 --> 00:50:58.985 line:80%
So, I'll have to endure this torture...

989
00:51:00.151 --> 00:51:01.401 line:80%
for a while now.

990
00:51:05.235 --> 00:51:07.610 line:80%
Purva! Purva!
Purva! Purva!

991
00:51:07.943 --> 00:51:09.318 line:80%
-Hey, don't walk on the tracks.
-What?

992
00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.235 line:80%
-Sorry, Purva.

993
00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:11.276 line:80%
Hey!

994
00:51:11.651 --> 00:51:14.526 line:80%
It's wrong of us to raise your hopes
of buying a car and then do that.

995
00:51:14.651 --> 00:51:16.151 line:80%
He was the one who gave the idea.

996
00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:19.443 line:80%
I'd told him. Buddy...

997
00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:23.693 line:80%
women need their incentive earnings
to fulfill many responsibilities.

998
00:51:23.735 --> 00:51:24.818 line:80%
Do you know what he said, Purva?

999
00:51:24.901 --> 00:51:27.568 line:80%
What responsibilities do women have,

1000
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:30.985 line:80%
besides Korean skincare
products, manicure, and pedicure?

1001
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.318 line:80%
He was dismissive in his comments.

1002
00:51:33.485 --> 00:51:35.235 line:80%
That's why I got him to apologize to you.

1003
00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.401 line:80%
Say sorry.

1004
00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:39.318 line:80%
-In the Telugu language, I--
-Shut up! Say you're sorry!

1005
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:40.360 line:80%
Sorry.

1006
00:51:40.443 --> 00:51:41.943 line:80%
Hey, say, "Sorry, sister."

1007
00:51:44.651 --> 00:51:46.651 line:80%
Sorry, sister. I'm a Lannister.

1008
00:51:46.985 --> 00:51:48.360 line:80%
Huh! Idiot!

1009
00:51:48.443 --> 00:51:50.526 line:80%
You touched the dupatta?
Even I haven't touched it.

1010
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:51.693 line:80%
We're Lannisters, buddy.

1011
00:51:51.776 --> 00:51:53.818 line:80%
-Is she convinced?
-No way! She was scolding you!

1012
00:51:54.235 --> 00:51:56.360 line:80%
Can you fall at her feet?
I'll plan something else.

1013
00:51:56.526 --> 00:51:59.943 line:80%
-Are you mad? The train is here.
-Please, bro, help me.

1014
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.568 line:80%
Even though I scolded him a lot,
he still came to the station.

1015
00:52:06.651 --> 00:52:09.860 line:80%
We shouldn't let go of such guys, Purva.
We should hand them over to the police.

1016
00:52:09.943 --> 00:52:12.443 line:80%
I know someone in the SHE team.
Shall we complain?

1017
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:15.110 line:80%
SHE team?
It's not a good idea.

1018
00:52:16.693 --> 00:52:20.151 line:80%
I know a gang. I'll get them
to the metro station tomorrow.

1019
00:52:20.193 --> 00:52:22.068 line:80%
He'll try to talk to you as usual.

1020
00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:23.901 line:80%
Don't talk. Just scream.

1021
00:52:24.026 --> 00:52:26.193 line:80%
The gang will think it's a case of
eve teasing and bash him! That works.

1022
00:52:26.318 --> 00:52:27.151 line:80%
You are right!

1023
00:52:27.235 --> 00:52:29.610 line:80%
Once they are beaten up,
they won't bother you again.

1024
00:52:29.776 --> 00:52:31.776 line:80%
Don't worry.
We'll take care of it tomorrow.

1025
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.110 line:80%
Hey, Purva!

1026
00:53:18.276 --> 00:53:19.485 line:80%
I sent you two emojis yesterday.

1027
00:53:19.568 --> 00:53:21.026 line:80%
There's only one tick.
Don't think you saw it.

1028
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.318 line:80%
I think the internet is not on.
Switch it on.

1029
00:53:23.401 --> 00:53:26.068 line:80%
The profile photo was beautiful.
I look at it every morning.

1030
00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:27.901 line:80%
Excuse me, sir.
I think she has blocked you.

1031
00:53:27.985 --> 00:53:28.776 line:80%
Why?

1032
00:53:28.943 --> 00:53:31.943 line:80%
Block? What did I do to deserve
being blocked?

1033
00:53:33.568 --> 00:53:35.776 line:80%
-Why are you crying?
-Will you stop torturing me?

1034
00:53:35.818 --> 00:53:37.818 line:80%
-Stop talking to me.
-Don't cry. Don't cry.

1035
00:53:37.901 --> 00:53:39.985 line:80%
Let's talk and solve.
Why are you crying?

1036
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:41.068 line:80%
Hey!

1037
00:53:41.443 --> 00:53:42.651 line:80%
Why's the girl crying?

1038
00:53:42.901 --> 00:53:44.068 line:80%
She is my friend.

1039
00:53:44.943 --> 00:53:47.026 line:80%
-Who is he, dude?
-They are public, brother!

1040
00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:48.568 line:80%
They're defending the girl.

1041
00:53:48.735 --> 00:53:50.651 line:80%
Don't lie.
You're clearly harassing her.

1042
00:53:50.693 --> 00:53:52.110 line:80%
We are friends since
Happy Days!

1043
00:53:52.276 --> 00:53:54.360 line:80%
Don't you know English?
You may ask her.

1044
00:53:54.776 --> 00:53:55.860 line:80%
Is he your friend?

1045
00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:57.318 line:80%
I don't know, sir.

1046
00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.235 line:80%
She's saying no.

1047
00:53:59.651 --> 00:54:03.026 line:80%
How's the expression?

1048
00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.193 line:80%
You're pan-world, bro.

1049
00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:07.443 line:80%
Hit him!

1050
00:54:08.235 --> 00:54:10.943 line:80%
KENYA...KOREA...

1051
00:54:11.985 --> 00:54:14.818 line:80%
The emotion worked.
Increase the dose.

1052
00:54:16.276 --> 00:54:17.110 line:80%
Harder!

1053
00:54:17.193 --> 00:54:18.901 line:80%
I'm unable to bear!

1054
00:54:18.985 --> 00:54:21.693 line:80%
Are we supposed to bend just the steel?

1055
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:24.110 line:80%
Please save me!

1056
00:54:25.651 --> 00:54:28.693 line:80%
Hey, someone's hitting me for real!
It's hurting me. Take it slow.

1057
00:54:29.068 --> 00:54:31.068 line:80%
Before we could hit him,
the public started hitting him, man.

1058
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:32.026 line:80%
What do we do, then?

1059
00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:33.860 line:80%
If we don't beat them,
they'll ask for a refund.

1060
00:54:33.985 --> 00:54:35.610 line:80%
-Then, let's beat them up! Hey, come.
-Let's get going.

1061
00:54:35.735 --> 00:54:37.651 line:80%
-Hey, get out of the way.
-Hey, move.

1062
00:54:37.901 --> 00:54:39.485 line:80%
Hey, why are you hitting?

1063
00:54:39.568 --> 00:54:41.443 line:80%
Punches! I'm losing my grip!

1064
00:54:41.526 --> 00:54:43.735 line:80%
These guys are hitting us for real!

1065
00:54:43.776 --> 00:54:44.651 line:80%
Hey, hold him tightly.

1066
00:54:44.693 --> 00:54:45.735 line:80%
My shoulder is slipping, man!

1067
00:54:45.943 --> 00:54:46.693 line:80%
Stop it, guys!

1068
00:54:46.735 --> 00:54:48.318 line:80%
Along with our guys,
the public will also join them!

1069
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.651 line:80%
You're now on a pan-universe level.

1070
00:54:49.693 --> 00:54:51.151 line:80%
What's this?

1071
00:54:51.235 --> 00:54:53.151 line:80%
Wait up!
They're hitting.

1072
00:54:55.235 --> 00:54:57.860 line:80%
Hurt me as much as you want to.
Look at my friend there.

1073
00:54:57.985 --> 00:54:59.151 line:80%
Please don't hit him.

1074
00:54:59.235 --> 00:55:01.735 line:80%
-Get him!
-Careful with his back. He's got piles.

1075
00:55:01.818 --> 00:55:02.651 line:80%
Hey, stop!

1076
00:55:02.735 --> 00:55:04.568 line:80%
Yeah, that's my stop.
That's my stop. Stop!

1077
00:55:04.693 --> 00:55:05.610 line:80%
Sir...Sir...Sir...

1078
00:55:05.651 --> 00:55:07.443 line:80%
He's got piles. Hit him hard.

1079
00:55:07.526 --> 00:55:10.610 line:80%
-Hold him tight.
-Hit him hard.

1080
00:55:10.735 --> 00:55:11.610 line:80%
From behind.

1081
00:55:14.943 --> 00:55:16.151 line:80%
-Come out.
-Oh my!

1082
00:55:18.485 --> 00:55:19.651 line:80%
Did I act well?

1083
00:55:20.235 --> 00:55:22.276 line:80%
-Emotion worked out well.
-What about my job?

1084
00:55:23.485 --> 00:55:24.818 line:80%
-Confirm.
-Sure?

1085
00:55:24.901 --> 00:55:26.610 line:80%
Come to the office in an hour.

1086
00:55:29.901 --> 00:55:31.943 line:80%
The emotion has worked out!

1087
00:55:31.985 --> 00:55:35.526 line:80%
-Have you seen how they beat me up?
-It's alright, the plan worked.

1088
00:55:47.485 --> 00:55:49.735 line:80%
-Hey! One strong Coffee.
-Okay, sir.

1089
00:55:50.401 --> 00:55:52.610 line:80%
If the emotion works out in a love story,
it's a blockbuster, man.

1090
00:55:52.776 --> 00:55:54.276 line:80%
-Hey, Aravind!
-Who is that?

1091
00:55:54.318 --> 00:55:55.985 line:80%
Sir. Is that you?
Sir...Sorry, sir.

1092
00:55:56.068 --> 00:55:57.026 line:80%
Namaskaram,
sir.

1093
00:55:57.151 --> 00:55:58.568 line:80%
Greetings, sir.

1094
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:02.193 line:80%
Who are these guys?
They look like street rowdies.

1095
00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:03.943 line:80%
You asked for recovery
agents for the bank. Right?

1096
00:56:04.026 --> 00:56:06.110 line:80%
I got great candidates.
Give them a job.

1097
00:56:06.193 --> 00:56:07.776 line:80%
Oh no!
These fellows?

1098
00:56:08.318 --> 00:56:11.318 line:80%
Alright, what is your
educational background?

1099
00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:13.068 line:80%
Sir, keep the qualifications aside.

1100
00:56:13.193 --> 00:56:14.735 line:80%
They are my best friends.
Give them the job.

1101
00:56:15.693 --> 00:56:18.443 line:80%
Educational background is all fine.

1102
00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:20.401 line:80%
But you said they are your friends.

1103
00:56:20.568 --> 00:56:22.110 line:80%
So, no job. Leave!

1104
00:56:22.235 --> 00:56:23.568 line:80%
I said get out, man.

1105
00:56:23.693 --> 00:56:24.610 line:80%
Let's leave, guys!

1106
00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.110 line:80%
Irresponsible!

1107
00:56:26.735 --> 00:56:28.943 line:80%
-Who did this?
-They hit me.

1108
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:30.110 line:80%
-Was it him?
-Yes.

1109
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.026 line:80%
-Hey! Boar, come here.
-He's calling us.

1110
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.276 line:80%
Did you beat up both of them?

1111
00:56:36.401 --> 00:56:37.901 line:80%
Yes. I beat them up.

1112
00:56:38.026 --> 00:56:40.401 line:80%
-I bashed them with these hands.
-Then take a hug!

1113
00:56:40.485 --> 00:56:41.735 line:80%
He smells like horse shit.

1114
00:56:41.776 --> 00:56:43.860 line:80%
I must give you a gift.

1115
00:56:43.943 --> 00:56:45.443 line:80%
No. I don't want the watch.
I just need the job.

1116
00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:48.776 line:80%
I'll give you the job as well.
This is for puncturing their face.

1117
00:56:48.901 --> 00:56:52.151 line:80%
Go! The job is not inside.
It's outside!

1118
00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:53.610 line:80%
Okay? All set.

1119
00:56:54.068 --> 00:56:56.735 line:80%
-Bro! Thank you bro.
-Congratulations, my boys.

1120
00:56:56.901 --> 00:56:59.860 line:80%
Come on, let's have a party.
What should we drink? Ten orange teas.

1121
00:57:01.068 --> 00:57:02.568 line:80%
-Excuse me!
-Yes, ma'am.

1122
00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:04.818 line:80%
-I'm looking for Mr. Vijay.
-How may I help you?

1123
00:57:14.693 --> 00:57:17.193 line:80%
-Vijay sir, a girl is here to meet you.
-Okay.

1124
00:57:17.485 --> 00:57:19.068 line:80%
You guys sit there for a while.

1125
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:20.110 line:80%
Hey, it might be Purva.

1126
00:57:20.193 --> 00:57:22.276 line:80%
The emotion worked, right?
Maybe she'll say sorry and kiss me.

1127
00:57:22.401 --> 00:57:24.818 line:80%
If that situation arises,
please leave, dude. Please.

1128
00:57:25.276 --> 00:57:26.485 line:80%
-A kiss?
-Yes.

1129
00:57:26.568 --> 00:57:27.776 line:80%
That too for you?

1130
00:57:29.026 --> 00:57:30.485 line:80%
Gosh!

1131
00:57:30.568 --> 00:57:33.026 line:80%
Why is she entering every single time?

1132
00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.276 line:80%
Hail Lord Rama!

1133
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.110 line:80%
-Why are you here?
-I came here to apologize.

1134
00:57:38.943 --> 00:57:40.068 line:80%
She wants me to apologize?

1135
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:41.318 line:80%
Do you see the level she has
stooped to?

1136
00:57:41.443 --> 00:57:43.193 line:80%
Maybe you couldn't hear
due to the beatings!

1137
00:57:43.276 --> 00:57:44.485 line:80%
She wants to say sorry.

1138
00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:45.651 line:80%
She said she's here to get an apology.

1139
00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.443 line:80%
It's a grammar mistake, dude.
You carry on, dear.

1140
00:57:47.651 --> 00:57:49.943 line:80%
What I did was wrong.
Forgive me.

1141
00:57:50.235 --> 00:57:51.360 line:80%
I'm really sorry.

1142
00:57:51.443 --> 00:57:53.818 line:80%
I don't want to hear your apologies.
Get out!

1143
00:57:54.193 --> 00:57:56.526 line:80%
What should I do to make you
accept my apology?

1144
00:57:57.735 --> 00:57:58.860 line:80%
Take the policy.

1145
00:57:58.985 --> 00:58:00.318 line:80%
I don't have the amount.

1146
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.901 line:80%
Don't you have money?
Just leave, then.

1147
00:58:03.901 --> 00:58:04.943 line:80%
What are these scars?

1148
00:58:05.485 --> 00:58:08.693 line:80%
My foot slipped while training
the agents in Kung Fu.

1149
00:58:08.776 --> 00:58:11.151 line:80%
I got away with a minor injury.
They are undergoing surgery.

1150
00:58:11.193 --> 00:58:12.651 line:80%
-How's their condition?
-They went to Guruvareddy.

1151
00:58:12.776 --> 00:58:14.110 line:80%
Okay. Okay.
You can leave now.

1152
00:58:15.776 --> 00:58:18.151 line:80%
One hit from me, and you'll be
an egg paratha.

1153
00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:21.485 line:80%
I feel for her.
You are going overboard.

1154
00:58:21.776 --> 00:58:23.485 line:80%
She's doing exactly what
you did to Purva.

1155
00:58:23.568 --> 00:58:25.235 line:80%
Think of it from her perspective.

1156
00:58:27.985 --> 00:58:30.401 line:80%
Did Harini do the same to me
as I did to Purva?

1157
00:58:30.735 --> 00:58:33.151 line:80%
I thought from her perspective.
I'm right!

1158
00:58:34.485 --> 00:58:36.651 line:80%
Hey! That doesn't
mean standing in her place--

1159
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:41.443 line:80%
I don't know if I'm explaining it
poorly or if he's just not convinced.

1160
00:58:41.485 --> 00:58:42.568 line:80%
Karma!

1161
00:58:42.818 --> 00:58:44.193 line:80%
Hi, girls! What's up?

1162
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.818 line:80%
Hey! The setup of the guys
who hit him was also his.

1163
00:58:48.026 --> 00:58:49.860 line:80%
He did that to gain sympathy.

1164
00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:51.818 line:80%
What planning!

1165
00:58:51.901 --> 00:58:54.068 line:80%
He's disturbing me a lot.

1166
00:58:54.151 --> 00:58:56.943 line:80%
I don't know how to get rid of him.

1167
00:58:57.985 --> 00:59:00.110 line:80%
Just him? You also love him.

1168
00:59:01.776 --> 00:59:03.443 line:80%
What are you talking about, Rishi?

1169
00:59:03.776 --> 00:59:06.485 line:80%
He's been acting so far.
It's your turn now.

1170
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.235 line:80%
You act and make him
fall in love with you.

1171
00:59:09.443 --> 00:59:10.485 line:80%
Use him as much as possible.

1172
00:59:10.693 --> 00:59:13.151 line:80%
-How's the idea?
-It's a nice idea.

1173
00:59:13.318 --> 00:59:16.651 line:80%
Take him shopping and to the movies.
He'll run away after a point!

1174
00:59:16.776 --> 00:59:19.235 line:80%
Listen to me.
He won't be able to handle it.

1175
00:59:35.401 --> 00:59:36.276 line:80%
Hi.

1176
00:59:36.401 --> 00:59:38.110 line:80%
It looks like you are
searching for something.

1177
00:59:38.151 --> 00:59:39.651 line:80%
I'm searching for you.

1178
00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:42.985 line:80%
Oh, no! What's this for?
Do you want to get me beaten again?

1179
00:59:43.068 --> 00:59:44.318 line:80%
This is too much.

1180
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.276 line:80%
What do you have to lose
by calling me your friend?

1181
00:59:47.526 --> 00:59:50.026 line:80%
I'm so sorry, Vijay.

1182
00:59:50.985 --> 00:59:52.693 line:80%
Did you get hurt badly?

1183
00:59:52.776 --> 00:59:53.943 line:80%
It's okay.

1184
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.985 line:80%
It looks like everyone on the
train is frustrated.

1185
00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:57.568 line:80%
They bashed mercilessly, Purva.

1186
00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:59.818 line:80%
The hospital bill came to 30,000 rupees.

1187
00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:03.776 line:80%
They said it'll take about three months
after physiotherapy. I'm clueless now!

1188
01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:06.610 line:80%
I'm very sorry, Vijay.

1189
01:00:06.651 --> 01:00:07.901 line:80%
It's okay.

1190
01:00:07.985 --> 01:00:10.401 line:80%
I came up with many acts to woo you.

1191
01:00:10.526 --> 01:00:13.401 line:80%
God wrote a different act
and gave me this return gift.

1192
01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:14.860 line:80%
Oh my!
It's my fate.

1193
01:00:14.943 --> 01:00:17.485 line:80%
-Did you get hurt here?
-All over here.

1194
01:00:17.651 --> 01:00:19.901 line:80%
-I'm so sorry.
-Close to my heart.

1195
01:00:19.943 --> 01:00:21.776 line:80%
-Here?
-It feels so good now.

1196
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.818 line:80%
I'm feeling hungry,
as I'm taking antibiotics.

1197
01:00:23.901 --> 01:00:26.318 line:80%
Can we have coffee, snacks, or biscuits?

1198
01:00:26.693 --> 01:00:28.901 line:80%
Bye, Vijay.

1199
01:00:29.235 --> 01:00:31.610 line:80%
Purva, say something.
What do you say?

1200
01:00:31.735 --> 01:00:32.693 line:80%
Cold coffee?

1201
01:00:32.943 --> 01:00:33.860 line:80%
Bullet coffee?

1202
01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:34.985 line:80%
Butterflies!

1203
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:37.110 line:80%
Butterflies are moving in my body.

1204
01:00:37.235 --> 01:00:40.860 line:80%
-Butterfly, butterfly, where are...
-What an actor!

1205
01:00:41.693 --> 01:00:44.485 line:80%

doing here at this time?

1219
01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.068 line:80%
My scooty isn't starting.

1220
01:02:19.776 --> 01:02:20.693 line:80%
Okay, hop on.
I'll drop you off.

1221
01:02:20.776 --> 01:02:22.818 line:80%
I'll only come if you accept my apology.

1222
01:02:22.943 --> 01:02:24.735 line:80%
I'll punch you in the face.
Come and get on.

1223
01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.110 line:80%
Okay. Accepted.
Get on.

1224
01:02:28.985 --> 01:02:30.318 line:80%
Say it with a smile.

1225
01:02:32.693 --> 01:02:35.443 line:80%
Will you get on?
I accept your apology.

1226
01:02:36.276 --> 01:02:37.318 line:80%
Come.

1227
01:02:42.443 --> 01:02:45.068 line:80%
Instead of driving so seriously,
why not smile a little?

1228
01:02:45.318 --> 01:02:47.235 line:80%
If you don't smile now...

1229
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.610 line:80%
Don't move! We may fall.
I'm ticklish.

1230
01:02:51.735 --> 01:02:53.943 line:80%
-Oh really?
-Hey... Hey... I'm sensitive.

I'm in love.

1250
01:04:08.151 --> 01:04:10.735 line:80%
Hi, Purva!
Happy...

1251
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.026 line:80%
birthday.
Oh no! Happy...

1252
01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:14.651 line:80%
Valentine's Day, Purva.

1253
01:04:14.735 --> 01:04:17.485 line:80%
A flower for you.
A pink flower for a pink girl.

1254
01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:18.735 line:80%
-Hi.
-Pink Lips--

1255
01:04:18.776 --> 01:04:20.193 line:80%
Hey, Purva.

1256
01:04:20.318 --> 01:04:22.568 line:80%
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-Thank you.

1257
01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:24.901 line:80%
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-Thank you.

1258
01:04:24.985 --> 01:04:27.776 line:80%
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Wow!

1259
01:04:27.943 --> 01:04:29.735 line:80%
Aren't the ducks so beautifully white?

1260
01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:33.235 line:80%
What's a good honeymoon destination
after getting married?

1261
01:04:33.401 --> 01:04:34.443 line:80%
Snowy places?

1262
01:04:34.568 --> 01:04:35.651 line:80%
Mountains and hills?

1263
01:04:35.735 --> 01:04:36.610 line:80%
Beaches?

1264
01:04:36.735 --> 01:04:39.193 line:80%
What is it, Vijay?
Why are you looking up?

1265
01:04:40.068 --> 01:04:41.068 line:80%
Valentine's Day.

1266
01:04:41.276 --> 01:04:44.360 line:80%
When Valentine's Day comes,
it's not just me,

1267
01:04:44.568 --> 01:04:47.943 line:80%
but all the singles like me
also wake up early that day

1268
01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:50.818 line:80%
and look at the sky like this
for fifteen or twenty minutes.

1269
01:04:50.943 --> 01:04:54.151 line:80%
It's because this day reminds us that
we don't have anyone.

1270
01:04:54.318 --> 01:04:56.276 line:80%
Do you even know what singles do
when Valentine's Day comes?

1271
01:04:56.318 --> 01:04:57.735 line:80%
After staring at the sky like that,
they come back,

1272
01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.651 line:80%
they have a full breakfast and
start watching
Premikula Roju
on TV.

1273
01:05:00.735 --> 01:05:03.985 line:80%
We have a good lunch in the afternoon
and watch
Manmadhudu.

1274
01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:05.943 line:80%
But only the first half.
Not the second half.

1275
01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.818 line:80%
because, you know,
he hates women and love. Right?

1276
01:05:08.068 --> 01:05:11.943 line:80%
After that, we take a small
power nap and wake up at four.

1277
01:05:12.068 --> 01:05:13.651 line:80%
After waking up, we swiftly enter

1278
01:05:13.693 --> 01:05:16.110 line:80%
some lovely parks and
thoroughly check them.

1279
01:05:16.193 --> 01:05:19.276 line:80%
Because that's where all these
lovebirds come, right?

1280
01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.651 line:80%
So, if there's any movement
in the bushes in that park...

1281
01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:25.526 line:80%
we used to pick up stones and hit them.
Then, we would go to the theater.

1282
01:05:25.651 --> 01:05:28.735 line:80%
We would always book corner seats
even if the entire hall was vacant.

1283
01:05:28.818 --> 01:05:31.860 line:80%
If any lovers came,
we used to tease and annoy them.

1284
01:05:32.026 --> 01:05:34.026 line:80%
Do you know that the forwarded
messages on Valentine's Day

1285
01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:35.860 line:80%
made me cry and drive me crazy?

1286
01:05:35.943 --> 01:05:39.735 line:80%
No one else knows how often we cried
except our blankets and pillows.

1287
01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:44.693 line:80%
Unable to bear that pain, by evening,
we would get completely drunk.

1288
01:05:44.901 --> 01:05:47.151 line:80%
We would watch
Salaar,
fold our lungis, and go to bed.

1289
01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:51.568 line:80%
So, at a time when we singles thought
that no girls would ever enter

1290
01:05:51.693 --> 01:05:52.860 line:80%
our lives again,

1291
01:05:53.276 --> 01:05:55.068 line:80%
a beautiful girl like you came

1292
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:58.818 line:80%
and proposed "I love you" to me
on Valentine's Day.

1293
01:05:59.068 --> 01:06:01.860 line:80%
I honestly don't even know
how to describe this feeling, Purva!

1294
01:06:01.943 --> 01:06:03.776 line:80%
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Purva.

1295
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.943 line:80%
Thank you for loving me.
This is an auspicious day.

1296
01:06:06.068 --> 01:06:08.235 line:80%
So, this is the first time.
It's the first time for me.

1297
01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:12.026 line:80%
-Hug me and make me breathless, dear.
-No, dear. I have to go now.

1298
01:06:12.193 --> 01:06:15.235 line:80%
-Go?
-Our manager has changed.

1299
01:06:15.276 --> 01:06:16.401 line:80%
I have to attend a meeting.

1300
01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:19.360 line:80%
You know we'll plan something special.
Okay?

1301
01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:20.860 line:80%
Bye!

1302
01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.401 line:80%
Bye.
See you.

1303
01:06:23.485 --> 01:06:25.276 line:80%
Have a good day.
Yeah!

1304
01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:26.568 line:80%
God exists.

1305
01:06:26.735 --> 01:06:27.860 line:80%
Lord Rama exists.

1306
01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:29.026 line:80%
Allah exists.

1307
01:06:29.193 --> 01:06:31.151 line:80%
Holy Jesus also exists.

1308
01:06:31.276 --> 01:06:33.735 line:80%
Hey, youngsters. Don't roll
in the bushes for long.

1309
01:06:33.776 --> 01:06:34.693 line:80%
-Your skin may get rashes.
-Sir, sir!

1310
01:06:34.776 --> 01:06:36.026 line:80%
This fell down, sir.

1311
01:06:36.318 --> 01:06:38.651 line:80%
-Hey! Thank you.
-I saw you there. You spoke well, sir.

1312
01:06:38.818 --> 01:06:40.401 line:80%
-Who are you?
-We are singles, sir.

1313
01:06:42.443 --> 01:06:43.901 line:80%
Don't be discouraged that you're single.

1314
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:45.776 line:80%
Don't worry that your age is increasing.

1315
01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.401 line:80%
Don't get agitated that you're
getting grey hair.

1316
01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:50.235 line:80%
Having baldness on top and a
belly below isn't a big problem.

1317
01:06:50.401 --> 01:06:51.443 line:80%
You must keep trying.

1318
01:06:51.526 --> 01:06:54.026 line:80%
If you keep trying,
our Valentine will come

1319
01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.110 line:80%
right before our eyes for us one day.

1320
01:06:56.235 --> 01:06:59.193 line:80%
If our efforts are sincere, why just one?
We might even get two.

1321
01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.235 line:80%
-Vijay...
-Who's that?

1322
01:07:01.401 --> 01:07:04.235 line:80%
Hey, Gen Z kid.
What are you doing here?

1323
01:07:04.485 --> 01:07:06.776 line:80%
Oh! It's Valentine's Day.
Right?

1324
01:07:06.901 --> 01:07:09.860 line:80%
Wearing a red T-shirt, you've brought a
red flower and a red box,

1325
01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:13.151 line:80%
which means you teen types have
no control over yourselves today.

1326
01:07:13.276 --> 01:07:16.110 line:80%
Who, who, who is that crazy guy?
Tell me, tell me, please!

1327
01:07:16.318 --> 01:07:18.443 line:80%
Is it that guy selling peanuts over there?

1328
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.610 line:80%
Or else

1329
01:07:19.693 --> 01:07:22.360 line:80%
Is it that guy over there plucking and
eating leaves from the tree?

1330
01:07:22.485 --> 01:07:24.151 line:80%
Tell me. Tell me. Even your height
matches perfectly with that guy.

1331
01:07:24.193 --> 01:07:25.110 line:80%
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.

1332
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:28.151 line:80%
-Who, who, who is that red flower?
-It's you!

1333
01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.110 line:80%
Hey, stop joking.

1334
01:07:31.235 --> 01:07:33.526 line:80%
Did you have a pint in the morning?
Get lost!

1335
01:07:33.735 --> 01:07:34.860 line:80%
I love you, Vijay.

1336
01:07:35.735 --> 01:07:37.068 line:80%
Are you out of your mind?

1337
01:07:37.193 --> 01:07:39.526 line:80%
Don't you get it when I say?
I don't have any such feelings for you.

1338
01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:40.735 line:80%
-I do.
-Hey...

1339
01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.485 line:80%
-I don't have feelings!
-We do have.

1340
01:07:53.443 --> 01:07:54.568 line:80%
Brother, we are just friends, brother.

1341
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.485 line:80%
I'm in a high-ranking position at the
bank. What do you even know about me?

1342
01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:00.110 line:80%
Do you hear that?
They're just friends.

1343
01:08:01.068 --> 01:08:03.735 line:80%
Hey, don't we know about
what you guys do here?

1344
01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:04.651 line:80%
True, brother.

1345
01:08:04.735 --> 01:08:06.693 line:80%
Don't we know what
you guys do in parks?

1346
01:08:06.735 --> 01:08:07.610 line:80%
I've never come to this park.

1347
01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:08.985 line:80%
-We are lovers!
-Hey! What do you mean?

1348
01:08:09.026 --> 01:08:10.568 line:80%
-You crazy? They'll get us married
-Hey!

1349
01:08:10.651 --> 01:08:11.776 line:80%
That girl says you both are lovers, right?

1350
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.443 line:80%
-We are just friends, brother.
-Brother, give me a minute.

1351
01:08:16.901 --> 01:08:18.651 line:80%
Look at this.
Who's this for?

1352
01:08:18.776 --> 01:08:20.401 line:80%
My girlfriend gave it to me
and just left.

1353
01:08:20.485 --> 01:08:21.526 line:80%
As it's Valentine's Day...

1354
01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:23.110 line:80%
Another girlfriend?

1355
01:08:23.193 --> 01:08:25.360 line:80%
Hey! Another girlfriend?
What the hell?

1356
01:08:25.485 --> 01:08:27.735 line:80%
Brother, we loved
each other so sincerely.

1357
01:08:27.818 --> 01:08:29.776 line:80%
Didn't you say
I was your sweetie and cutie?

1358
01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.151 line:80%
Brother, he gave me so many kisses!

1359
01:08:31.235 --> 01:08:32.901 line:80%
Brother, if you have poison,
give it to me.

1360
01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:34.818 line:80%
-I'm going to drink it here and die.
-Hey, come here.

1361
01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:36.485 line:80%
Come here.

1362
01:08:36.943 --> 01:08:38.235 line:80%
I said come here!

1363
01:08:38.485 --> 01:08:39.985 line:80%
You go there.

1364
01:08:41.193 --> 01:08:42.318 line:80%
Tie it.

1365
01:08:42.776 --> 01:08:45.360 line:80%
-Jai Bhagavan!
-Tie it.

1366
01:08:45.443 --> 01:08:46.735 line:80%
-Jai Bhagavan!
-[crowd] Jai Bhagavan!

1367
01:08:46.943 --> 01:08:48.026 line:80%
-Please!
-Tie it.

1368
01:08:48.151 --> 01:08:52.985 line:80%
Jai Bhagavan! Jai Bhagavan!
Jai Bhagavan! Jai Bhagavan!

1369
01:08:53.068 --> 01:08:57.193 line:80%
Oh dear almighty!

1370
01:08:57.318 --> 01:09:01.818 line:80%
[crowd] Jai Bhagavan!

1371
01:09:05.235 --> 01:09:06.360 line:80%
Oh my!

1372
01:09:11.443 --> 01:09:14.110 line:80%
It was a good thing I acted like
I fainted due to heatstroke.

1373
01:09:14.235 --> 01:09:15.776 line:80%
Otherwise, those marriage bureau boys...

1374
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.860 line:80%
would've married me
to Harini by now, man.

1375
01:09:18.068 --> 01:09:19.568 line:80%
When they were saying "tie the knot,"

1376
01:09:19.651 --> 01:09:21.776 line:80%
why is she bending her neck
and saying, "Tie it"?

1377
01:09:21.818 --> 01:09:22.818 line:80%
Is that a shoe lace?

1378
01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:25.235 line:80%
I don't understand where this
society is headed.

1379
01:09:25.735 --> 01:09:27.651 line:80%
Which park did they go to?
Are they still there?

1380
01:09:27.693 --> 01:09:30.276 line:80%
-Indira Park. They are still there.
-Okay. Why do I care?

1381
01:09:30.401 --> 01:09:31.860 line:80%
Why are you taking the phone out?

1382
01:09:32.818 --> 01:09:35.068 line:80%
Anyway, the nuptial chain
is also sponsored.

1383
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:36.985 line:80%
If I take Gayathri there, at least
I can save on wedding expenses.

1384
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:38.818 line:80%
We should head
in the same direction as society.

1385
01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:39.776 line:80%
Get lost.

1386
01:09:39.901 --> 01:09:41.443 line:80%
Society, he says!

1387
01:09:41.485 --> 01:09:45.693 line:80%
As if he's some bigshot, he's telling us
we should align with society.

1388
01:09:45.735 --> 01:09:47.568 line:80%
He's overacting.

1389
01:09:48.401 --> 01:09:50.401 line:80%
-Hello.
-Sir, there's a girl here to see you.

1390
01:09:50.443 --> 01:09:52.068 line:80%
-Who is it?
-Some Harini, it seems.

1391
01:09:52.151 --> 01:09:53.110 line:80%
Harini?

1392
01:09:54.318 --> 01:09:55.568 line:80%
Looks like the girl is here.

1393
01:09:55.818 --> 01:09:57.235 line:80%
Come on, let's go and discuss.

1394
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.151 line:80%
Why get me involved in this?

1395
01:09:58.193 --> 01:10:01.235 line:80%
-You are my only friend.
-I'm turning into a sidekick.

1396
01:10:01.276 --> 01:10:03.193 line:80%
It's okay, you still got a full length.

1397
01:10:09.776 --> 01:10:12.068 line:80%
-Hi.
-Why are you shaking hands with her?

1398
01:10:12.151 --> 01:10:14.526 line:80%
-Why did you come?
-What have you thought about my love?

1399
01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:15.985 line:80%
Hey!

1400
01:10:16.526 --> 01:10:17.693 line:80%
This, this...

1401
01:10:17.818 --> 01:10:18.818 line:80%
All this is dust.

1402
01:10:18.901 --> 01:10:20.818 line:80%
Beauty is not permanent.
Love is permanent.

1403
01:10:21.068 --> 01:10:24.235 line:80%
Six months ago, I gave that kind of love
to a girl named Purva.

1404
01:10:24.651 --> 01:10:26.610 line:80%
I know why you love me so much.

1405
01:10:26.818 --> 01:10:28.943 line:80%
That day at the metro station, you were
impressed by my fighting style, right?

1406
01:10:29.151 --> 01:10:29.985 line:80%
To be frank,

1407
01:10:30.151 --> 01:10:31.235 line:80%
had it been anyone else
in that situation,

1408
01:10:31.318 --> 01:10:33.568 line:80%
even Gayathri, my friend's
girlfriend, I would've done the same.

1409
01:10:33.776 --> 01:10:35.610 line:80%
Because...
that's my self-respect.

1410
01:10:35.735 --> 01:10:37.735 line:80%
Not self-respect. Values.

1411
01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:39.276 line:80%
That's what I meant.
Of mistake.

1412
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.318 line:80%
Even by mistake,
you won't forget to mention Gayathri.

1413
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.568 line:80%
I spoke out of emotion.

1414
01:10:43.735 --> 01:10:46.693 line:80%
Emotion? You wanted privacy, right?
Have your privacy.

1415
01:10:46.818 --> 01:10:47.651 line:80%
I'm out of here.

1416
01:10:47.735 --> 01:10:48.776 line:80%
Hear to me.

1417
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:50.818 line:80%
It's not "hear to me".
It's "listen to me".

1418
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.235 line:80%
What a fate!

1419
01:10:52.943 --> 01:10:53.818 line:80%
Why are you laughing?

1420
01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:55.318 line:80%
Making that funny noise.

1421
01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:57.401 line:80%
-You saved me?
-Yes.

1422
01:10:57.568 --> 01:11:01.193 line:80%
You thought I didn’t know
that you had hired those rowdies.

1423
01:11:01.235 --> 01:11:02.735 line:80%
How did she know?

1424
01:11:02.901 --> 01:11:04.693 line:80%
Shall I tell you another shocking news?

1425
01:11:05.026 --> 01:11:06.985 line:80%
Purva isn't in love with you.

1426
01:11:07.068 --> 01:11:09.235 line:80%
She has been pretending to love you.

1427
01:11:14.318 --> 01:11:15.235 line:80%
Hey!

1428
01:11:15.318 --> 01:11:16.401 line:80%
Since you can't have me,

1429
01:11:16.568 --> 01:11:19.818 line:80%
are you trying to separate us
with a random story?

1430
01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:20.776 line:80%
I don't believe you.

1431
01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.776 line:80%
Believe it or not, it's your choice.

1432
01:11:23.068 --> 01:11:25.318 line:80%
If not today, you will know
the truth tomorrow.

1433
01:11:25.526 --> 01:11:26.776 line:80%
Whatever!

1434
01:11:28.026 --> 01:11:31.068 line:80%
Oh no, I didn't say 'send nudes',
I said 'send address'.

1435
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:34.068 line:80%
By mistake, it came out that way.
Sorry. I'll call you back.

1436
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:38.526 line:80%
Why are you so frustrated?
Enjoying the love triangle, are you?

1437
01:11:39.318 --> 01:11:41.610 line:80%
This girl is saying
random things about Purva.

1438
01:11:41.776 --> 01:11:44.318 line:80%
-Crazy girl. She is killing me.
-Forget about Harini.

1439
01:11:44.776 --> 01:11:45.943 line:80%
What are your plans for Purva?

1440
01:11:45.985 --> 01:11:48.318 line:80%
I am already going mad
with what Harini told me.

1441
01:11:48.401 --> 01:11:49.693 line:80%
Should we booze?

1442
01:11:51.818 --> 01:11:52.818 line:80%
Purva!

1443
01:11:53.651 --> 01:11:55.485 line:80%
-Hello!
-Hi, Vijay.

1444
01:11:55.651 --> 01:11:56.485 line:80%
Hi.

1445
01:11:56.651 --> 01:11:59.610 line:80%
I am free this evening.
Where shall we go?

1446
01:11:59.735 --> 01:12:01.360 line:80%
Yes, yes. Where shall we go?

1447
01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:02.485 line:80%
Shall we go to a pub?

1448
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:03.818 line:80%
Pub?

1449
01:12:04.026 --> 01:12:04.943 line:80%
Let's go.

1450
01:12:05.026 --> 01:12:06.735 line:80%
For sure, but which one?

1451
01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:09.943 line:80%
-Carpe Diem...
-Oh, Carpe Diem, definitely.

1452
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:11.193 line:80%
I go there frequently.

1453
01:12:11.318 --> 01:12:12.568 line:80%
Okay, bye, see you.

1454
01:12:12.818 --> 01:12:13.735 line:80%
Bye.

1455
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.443 line:80%
Dude! Are you going to a pub?

1456
01:12:15.568 --> 01:12:20.443 line:80%
In the evening, I am going
to a pub with Purva.

1457
01:12:21.151 --> 01:12:25.360 line:80%
I will dance with Purva at the pub.

1458
01:12:25.485 --> 01:12:26.568 line:80%
Wow.

1459
01:12:26.651 --> 01:12:29.860 line:80%
-That's the surprise!
-The entry fee will be 5000 rupees.

1460
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:33.151 line:80%
If you have drinks there, then
your bill will be 20,000 rupees.

1461
01:12:33.318 --> 01:12:38.068 line:80%
Do you think I can't even spend
25000 for my love?

1462
01:12:38.193 --> 01:12:40.235 line:80%
Just yesterday,
I applied for a personal loan.

1463
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.151 line:80%
-Applied for a personal loan?
-Yes.

1464
01:12:42.276 --> 01:12:44.443 line:80%
I will shake the pub
with my dance moves.

1465
01:12:46.901 --> 01:12:48.735 line:80%
Oh! Ladies are smoking.

1466
01:12:48.943 --> 01:12:50.526 line:80%
-Hello, sir.
-How much is the entry fee?

1467
01:12:50.693 --> 01:12:52.568 line:80%
-3000, sir.
-Very cheap.

1468
01:12:52.943 --> 01:12:56.526 line:80%
Why did that Aravind say
the entry fee is 10,000 rupees? Whatever.

1469
01:12:56.651 --> 01:12:58.568 line:80%
Okay, do you have a girlfriend?

1470
01:12:58.651 --> 01:12:59.985 line:80%
-No, sir.
-So sad.

1471
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.943 line:80%
I have a girlfriend.

1472
01:13:01.026 --> 01:13:02.360 line:80%
-Oh!
-She is coming now.

1473
01:13:02.485 --> 01:13:03.943 line:80%
We both will dance.

1474
01:13:05.068 --> 01:13:06.526 line:80%
-Do you play Balayya's songs?
-Yes, sir.

1475
01:13:06.651 --> 01:13:08.651 line:80%
Oh wow, that's fantastic,
fantastic, fantastic.

1476
01:13:11.318 --> 01:13:13.401 line:80%
-Hi!
-Hi.

1477
01:13:15.026 --> 01:13:16.485 line:80%
Why is she bringing her brigade?

1478
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:18.068 line:80%
-Hi, bros!
-Hello!

1479
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:20.110 line:80%
-These are...?
-My friends. Do you have any problem?

1480
01:13:20.193 --> 01:13:22.068 line:80%
No problem, no problem.
It's okay.

1481
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:37.818 line:80%
I know women in Hyderabad drink,

1482
01:13:37.943 --> 01:13:39.860 line:80%
but oh my god,

1483
01:13:39.943 --> 01:13:41.776 line:80%
the bill might explode!

1484
01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.318 line:80%
Look at them knocking back shots!

1485
01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.193 line:80%
Even I can't drink them.
It burns!

1486
01:13:46.318 --> 01:13:48.235 line:80%
Forty beers and twenty shots,
oh my god!

1487
01:13:49.193 --> 01:13:51.901 line:80%
My ears are throbbing, oh my god!
What are these noises?

1488
01:13:53.151 --> 01:13:57.235 line:80%
♪ This gold is old
Didn't you buy new? ♪

1489
01:13:57.318 --> 01:13:59.568 line:80%
♪ It's old
I didn't buy anything new ♪

1490
01:13:59.901 --> 01:14:01.401 line:80%
Hello kiddo...

1491
01:14:01.526 --> 01:14:02.860 line:80%
What are you doing?

1492
01:14:02.943 --> 01:14:04.526 line:80%
On Valentine's Day.

1493
01:14:04.651 --> 01:14:05.693 line:80%
Having fun with your girlfriend,
I suppose.

1494
01:14:05.735 --> 01:14:07.026 line:80%
Having a candlelight dinner?

1495
01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.568 line:80%
Because of a beggar,

1496
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.318 line:80%
she's at her place and I am at mine,
enjoying Valentine's Day.

1497
01:14:11.401 --> 01:14:12.276 line:80%
Why so?

1498
01:14:12.526 --> 01:14:15.235 line:80%
I gave you space
so that you guys could enjoy.

1499
01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.526 line:80%
And I am roaming outside.

1500
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:17.485 line:80%
Aren't you enjoying?

1501
01:14:17.818 --> 01:14:20.193 line:80%
I don't need your sympathy,
tell me what you want.

1502
01:14:20.568 --> 01:14:21.651 line:80%
Nothing much.

1503
01:14:21.818 --> 01:14:23.651 line:80%
I thought she would
come alone to the pub.

1504
01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:25.401 line:80%
But she brought 20 others.

1505
01:14:25.485 --> 01:14:27.693 line:80%
I'm scared just seeing them drink.

1506
01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:29.610 line:80%
You opted for a personal loan, right?

1507
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.276 line:80%
Even a home loan wouldn't cover
what they're drinking.

1508
01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:35.318 line:80%
Send me 50,000 rupees.

1509
01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:40.776 line:80%
Just to save 10,000, you left
your childhood friend behind.

1510
01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:42.943 line:80%
In the US, they'd call you
a potential immigrant.

1511
01:14:43.026 --> 01:14:44.568 line:80%
-In China, they will call you a parasite.
-Hello? Hello?

1512
01:14:44.651 --> 01:14:46.026 line:80%
I know you can hear me.

1513
01:14:46.068 --> 01:14:47.485 line:80%
In Korea, they'd call you a psycho.

1514
01:14:47.568 --> 01:14:49.693 line:80%
-Love you kiddo!
-In India, you are a bloody fool!

1515
01:15:00.443 --> 01:15:02.151 line:80%
I just took a shot.

1516
01:15:02.318 --> 01:15:06.443 line:80%
Now, if I go and do that
Adhi Dha Surprisu
step with Purva...

1517
01:15:20.943 --> 01:15:24.235 line:80%
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Coming with snake dance.

1518
01:15:25.026 --> 01:15:25.985 line:80%
Hey! Hey!

1519
01:15:26.068 --> 01:15:27.943 line:80%
You damn fools!
Why are you taking me--

1520
01:15:28.235 --> 01:15:29.860 line:80%
Leave me, guys.

1521
01:15:30.068 --> 01:15:32.735 line:80%
They're like buffaloes.
Did they drink and get high?

1522
01:15:35.735 --> 01:15:38.443 line:80%
Oh my!
How is she so strong?

1523
01:15:38.651 --> 01:15:40.735 line:80%
The sense of touch isn't working at all.

1524
01:15:42.443 --> 01:15:44.526 line:80%
What's with them?

1525
01:16:00.693 --> 01:16:01.776 line:80%
Hey, move aside.

1526
01:16:03.235 --> 01:16:04.818 line:80%
He's escaped. Yeah!

1527
01:16:06.443 --> 01:16:08.193 line:80%
Hey! Have you gone nuts?

1528
01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.026 line:80%
What are you thinking about me?
Why are you torturing me?

1529
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:11.526 line:80%
I wanted to dance with you
for two minutes.

1530
01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:13.901 line:80%
Why me?
Am I Icon Star Allu Arjun?

1531
01:16:14.026 --> 01:16:16.610 line:80%
-Then, love me and I will teach you.
-Hey!

1532
01:16:16.693 --> 01:16:17.735 line:80%
These legs don't bend.

1533
01:16:17.818 --> 01:16:19.901 line:80%
Look, I have to
bend so much to talk to you.

1534
01:16:19.943 --> 01:16:21.110 line:80%
Our heights don't match.

1535
01:16:21.235 --> 01:16:22.318 line:80%
Love, is it?

1536
01:16:22.443 --> 01:16:24.693 line:80%
Love should come from here.

1537
01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.818 line:80%
That already happened to me with Purva.

1538
01:16:26.985 --> 01:16:28.443 line:80%
If I marry you...

1539
01:16:28.485 --> 01:16:29.360 line:80%
See, girl.

1540
01:16:29.401 --> 01:16:31.776 line:80%
I'll have to bend down and walk,
all my life.

1541
01:16:34.485 --> 01:16:35.485 line:80%
Bend down.

1542
01:16:35.568 --> 01:16:38.443 line:80%
Height isn't important,
only love is important.

1543
01:16:38.485 --> 01:16:40.485 line:80%
Don't you see the love in my eyes?

1544
01:16:42.651 --> 01:16:45.693 line:80%
Not love, I only see
exhaustion from lack of sleep. Take rest.

1545
01:16:45.776 --> 01:16:47.693 line:80%
Don't you see
that she's cheating you?

1546
01:16:47.776 --> 01:16:50.235 line:80%
If she really loves you,
would she bring so many people along?

1547
01:16:50.318 --> 01:16:52.485 line:80%
You'll come to know
when you pay the bill.

1548
01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:54.651 line:80%
Why do you care?
I'll pay it, get lost.

1549
01:16:57.026 --> 01:16:59.693 line:80%
-Bro! What a party, bro!
-Hey!

1550
01:16:59.776 --> 01:17:00.985 line:80%
Wait, why don't you
have two more drinks?

1551
01:17:01.026 --> 01:17:02.568 line:80%
-We haven't danced yet.
-We have danced already.

1552
01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:03.526 line:80%
I haven't gotten high yet.

1553
01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:05.568 line:80%
-Bill?
-We got high and enjoyed it a lot.

1554
01:17:05.651 --> 01:17:06.735 line:80%
No, I haven't gotten into the vibe yet.

1555
01:17:06.818 --> 01:17:08.610 line:80%
Party yours. Bill yours.
Congratulations, bro.

1556
01:17:08.693 --> 01:17:11.401 line:80%
-Bye, bro.
-Thanks, Vijay. Bye.

1557
01:17:12.776 --> 01:17:13.693 line:80%
One lakh rupees?

1558
01:17:13.776 --> 01:17:16.443 line:80%
No sir, 99,999 only.

1559
01:17:16.651 --> 01:17:18.985 line:80%
You're overdoing it, man.

1560
01:17:19.276 --> 01:17:20.651 line:80%
One lakh rupee bill?

1561
01:17:20.735 --> 01:17:23.110 line:80%
With one lakh, I could eat
from Swiggy for a whole year.

1562
01:17:23.151 --> 01:17:24.860 line:80%
What do I do?

1563
01:17:26.818 --> 01:17:30.651 line:80%
Like a wild boar directly running
into a hunter's jeep,

1564
01:17:30.735 --> 01:17:32.860 line:80%
he walked right into it, lover boy!

1565
01:17:32.943 --> 01:17:34.776 line:80%
I'm coming.

1566
01:17:40.151 --> 01:17:42.776 line:80%
Sir, smile.
Closely. Lively.

1567
01:17:42.818 --> 01:17:44.110 line:80%
Made for each other.

1568
01:17:44.235 --> 01:17:46.401 line:80%
Kiss each other.
Come on. Come on.

1569
01:17:46.526 --> 01:17:48.776 line:80%
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Wow!

1570
01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.568 line:80%
-You! Delete them first.
-Are the young couple enjoying

1571
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:55.985 line:80%
on Valentine's Day?
Is this a secret?

1572
01:17:56.026 --> 01:17:57.735 line:80%
Nothing like that.

1573
01:17:57.776 --> 01:17:58.985 line:80%
All that's fine. I need 50,000.

1574
01:17:59.276 --> 01:18:01.443 line:80%
What! I don't have 50,000.

1575
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:03.568 line:80%
You don't? Alright, I'm leaving.

1576
01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:05.818 line:80%
I'll post this on Insta
and tag ma'am.

1577
01:18:05.901 --> 01:18:09.026 line:80%
Why are you creating a scene like this?

1578
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:11.360 line:80%
This card's limit is 50,000.

1579
01:18:11.401 --> 01:18:12.735 line:80%
Okay. Leave.

1580
01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:16.276 line:80%
Hey, please delete those photos.

1581
01:18:16.443 --> 01:18:19.901 line:80%
I'll delete it after emailing it
to myself. In case I need it later.

1582
01:18:20.693 --> 01:18:22.693 line:80%
This little one said she'd leave me alone
if I visited the temple.

1583
01:18:23.235 --> 01:18:26.443 line:80%
What is she going to say at the temple?
Let's settle this today.

1584
01:18:27.193 --> 01:18:29.235 line:80%
Sir. Sir! Please come.

1585
01:18:33.526 --> 01:18:36.110 line:80%
-Why don't you buy a lamp?
-I don't believe in all this.

1586
01:18:36.151 --> 01:18:39.901 line:80%
Dear, I don't think you know
about this temple.

1587
01:18:40.235 --> 01:18:43.943 line:80%
If you light a lamp
and pray at this temple,

1588
01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:45.985 line:80%
all your wishes will be granted.

1589
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:49.776 line:80%
Then, why don't you light a lamp
and pray for good fortune?

1590
01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:53.443 line:80%
Tell these stories to Saxis Bank
employees, not SDFC employees.

1591
01:18:53.651 --> 01:18:55.360 line:80%
Is it Karthika Deepam?

1592
01:19:02.485 --> 01:19:04.776 line:80%
I should use this to hit on the head.

1593
01:19:05.235 --> 01:19:06.651 line:80%
Hey, Vijay.

1594
01:19:06.985 --> 01:19:09.776 line:80%
Light a lamp in this temple,
and your wishes come true, you know?

1595
01:19:10.401 --> 01:19:11.485 line:80%
Who told you this?

1596
01:19:11.568 --> 01:19:13.318 line:80%
The guy sitting outside the temple?

1597
01:19:13.943 --> 01:19:15.776 line:80%
Even if you don't believe, I do.

1598
01:19:15.901 --> 01:19:18.110 line:80%
That's why I lit the lamp
for love to be successful.

1599
01:19:20.651 --> 01:19:22.235 line:80%
This one, right?

1600
01:19:22.526 --> 01:19:23.526 line:80%
Oh my god!

1601
01:19:23.568 --> 01:19:24.693 line:80%
I didn't pray for my love,

1602
01:19:24.818 --> 01:19:26.818 line:80%
I prayed for the success
of your love story.

1603
01:19:28.651 --> 01:19:30.901 line:80%
Why would I pray for your love?

1604
01:19:30.943 --> 01:19:33.776 line:80%
I prayed for my love
and that I'd get you to light the lamp.

1605
01:19:33.818 --> 01:19:34.860 line:80%
And I did it!

1606
01:19:34.943 --> 01:19:36.568 line:80%
So my love will be a success!
Thanks my god.

1607
01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:38.276 line:80%
How dare you make me
light a lamp for your love story?

1608
01:19:38.401 --> 01:19:40.568 line:80%
You are a psycho. Are you mad?
Why did you call me at all?

1609
01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:42.443 line:80%
Every Tuesday, Purva
comes to this temple.

1610
01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:43.443 line:80%
Purva?

1611
01:19:43.526 --> 01:19:46.860 line:80%
If she sees us like this, she's going
to avoid you totally.

1612
01:19:47.068 --> 01:19:48.985 line:80%
Look at me and
how I came trusting you.

1613
01:19:52.568 --> 01:19:53.401 line:80%
Vijay?

1614
01:19:53.985 --> 01:19:55.610 line:80%
Do you also come to this temple?

1615
01:19:55.693 --> 01:19:57.276 line:80%
I sometimes come here for the
prasad.

1616
01:19:57.610 --> 01:19:58.568 line:80%
Who is this girl?

1617
01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:01.235 line:80%
Client.

1618
01:20:01.443 --> 01:20:04.110 line:80%
I'm clearing her doubts
about a policy she took.

1619
01:20:04.235 --> 01:20:06.235 line:80%
Purva! Did you know?

1620
01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.776 line:80%
If you light a lamp in this temple,
all your wishes will come true.

1621
01:20:09.901 --> 01:20:11.360 line:80%
-Is it, Vijay?
-Yes.

1622
01:20:11.526 --> 01:20:14.818 line:80%
-Then, can you bring me a lamp?
-Sure, I'll bring it right away.

1623
01:20:14.901 --> 01:20:18.235 line:80%
Wait here, you'll get tanned
from the light of these lamps.

1624
01:20:19.401 --> 01:20:20.776 line:80%
You won't get tanned.

1625
01:20:25.401 --> 01:20:26.485 line:80%
Here he comes.

1626
01:20:27.235 --> 01:20:28.651 line:80%
Give me a lamp.

1627
01:20:28.818 --> 01:20:30.568 line:80%
I don't sell to non-believers.

1628
01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.985 line:80%
Hey! I was just joking a while ago.
Give me one.

1629
01:20:34.068 --> 01:20:36.985 line:80%
From today, I don't sell lamps.

1630
01:20:37.151 --> 01:20:41.026 line:80%
I'll light all the lamps
and become a millionaire.

1631
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:43.193 line:80%
Take this 100 rupees, stop talking
and give me the lamp.

1632
01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:45.818 line:80%
Not 100, each diya is now 1000.

1633
01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.068 line:80%
It is only ten rupees, right?

1634
01:20:47.193 --> 01:20:50.776 line:80%
That is for Saxis Bank employees.
For SDFC employees it's 1000 rupees.

1635
01:20:50.943 --> 01:20:52.735 line:80%
-Hand me the matchbox.
-Pay 500 rupees.

1636
01:20:53.276 --> 01:20:55.568 line:80%
-Even for SDFC Bank employees?
-Yes.

1637
01:20:56.151 --> 01:21:00.401 line:80%
Okay, I'll see you when you come
to our bank for a home loan.

1638
01:21:00.443 --> 01:21:02.026 line:80%
-I'm letting you go because it's a temple.
-I'll also see.

1639
01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:07.068 line:80%
Wow, what did you wish for, Purva?

1640
01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.276 line:80%
-If you say it out loud, it won't happen.
-Right.

1641
01:21:10.401 --> 01:21:12.026 line:80%
It looks like she wished
to get married to me.

1642
01:21:12.151 --> 01:21:14.068 line:80%
Come on. Come on.
It's Karthika Deepam's time.

1643
01:21:16.235 --> 01:21:18.193 line:80%
Hmm. Hmm.
Be careful.

1644
01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:36.818 line:80%
Please, little one.

1645
01:21:37.818 --> 01:21:38.943 line:80%
That's it!

1646
01:21:39.485 --> 01:21:41.860 line:80%
As it's a temple,
I'm walking with my head bowed.

1647
01:21:41.943 --> 01:21:43.235 line:80%
I'll give it back to her.

1648
01:21:44.026 --> 01:21:46.360 line:80%
Shit! Even after
my love is set,

1649
01:21:47.151 --> 01:21:49.110 line:80%
I can't enjoy it
because of this Harini.

1650
01:21:49.276 --> 01:21:50.485 line:80%
How?

1651
01:21:50.526 --> 01:21:53.818 line:80%
Is it the same way
you're torturing me?

1652
01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:54.818 line:80%
That's nothing.

1653
01:21:55.276 --> 01:21:56.401 line:80%
Hey!

1654
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:58.401 line:80%
Purva calling!

1655
01:22:00.235 --> 01:22:02.068 line:80%
-Hello, Purva!
-Vijay...

1656
01:22:02.193 --> 01:22:04.193 line:80%
Can we go for a movie?

1657
01:22:04.318 --> 01:22:05.401 line:80%
One second, Purva.

1658
01:22:05.443 --> 01:22:06.318 line:80%
Dude!

1659
01:22:06.401 --> 01:22:08.943 line:80%
Purva is on the line. She is asking
me out for a movie.

1660
01:22:09.026 --> 01:22:11.360 line:80%
Today we are going to enjoy
in the corner seats.

1661
01:22:11.818 --> 01:22:12.693 line:80%
He's screwed.

1662
01:22:12.818 --> 01:22:14.401 line:80%
-Yes Purva!
-Pushpa 2,
Vijay.

1663
01:22:14.651 --> 01:22:17.151 line:80%
-Sure we'll go, Purva.
-Tell him 20 members are coming.

1664
01:22:17.318 --> 01:22:18.485 line:80%
-Yeah, tell him.
-Tell him.

1665
01:22:18.568 --> 01:22:20.401 line:80%
My twenty friends are also joining.

1666
01:22:20.693 --> 01:22:24.485 line:80%
-So, we'll have fun.
-Ask for recliner seats.

1667
01:22:24.651 --> 01:22:27.318 line:80%
-Twenty friends?
-Yes, is there a problem, Vijay?

1668
01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:30.985 line:80%
Nothing, nothing.
Can you send their Ids?

1669
01:22:31.235 --> 01:22:32.401 line:80%
Okay, we'll meet at the theatre.

1670
01:22:32.485 --> 01:22:33.818 line:80%
Yeah. See you soon.

1671
01:22:33.901 --> 01:22:35.526 line:80%
-Bye.
-Bye.

1672
01:22:40.151 --> 01:22:43.610 line:80%
Hey! You, me and Purva are watching
Pushpa 2
in the evening.

1673
01:22:43.693 --> 01:22:46.318 line:80%
Should I waste my time,
while you have fun with Purva?

1674
01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.235 line:80%
I'm not a side-kick.

1675
01:22:47.276 --> 01:22:49.943 line:80%
Then we'll do one thing.
We can take Gayathri along.

1676
01:22:50.026 --> 01:22:53.026 line:80%
-Gayathri hasn't met Purva, right?
-You're right.

1677
01:22:53.276 --> 01:22:55.610 line:80%
I haven't been able to take her out
because of this torture.

1678
01:22:55.693 --> 01:22:58.151 line:80%
She'll also feel happy.
Let me ask her once.

1679
01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:01.568 line:80%
-Hello, Gayathri!
-Yes, baby.

1680
01:23:01.651 --> 01:23:03.443 line:80%
-Shall we go for
Pushpa 2--
-We'll go.

1681
01:23:03.526 --> 01:23:05.068 line:80%
-Yes, she'll come.
-She will.

1682
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.026 line:80%
-Book twenty tickets quickly.
-Okay!

1683
01:23:07.985 --> 01:23:11.860 line:80%
You liar! I should've known when
you dragged Gayathri into this plan.

1684
01:23:11.901 --> 01:23:14.360 line:80%
I don't have the money to book.
Do whatever you want.

1685
01:23:15.735 --> 01:23:16.985 line:80%
-You don't have the money?
-No.

1686
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:19.110 line:80%
Sounds like a big problem.

1687
01:23:19.235 --> 01:23:21.110 line:80%
-This time a diamond ring--
-Oh!

1688
01:23:21.443 --> 01:23:23.860 line:80%
I saw everything ...

1689
01:23:23.901 --> 01:23:27.193 line:80%
How can you enter my cabin,
without my permission?

1690
01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:28.360 line:80%
Are you wearing clothes, sir?

1691
01:23:28.443 --> 01:23:30.360 line:80%
-Can we look?
-Open your eyes, man.

1692
01:23:31.276 --> 01:23:33.151 line:80%
Nothing happened here, man.

1693
01:23:34.026 --> 01:23:35.901 line:80%
Sir, it's an emergency.

1694
01:23:36.026 --> 01:23:37.235 line:80%
What's the emergency?

1695
01:23:37.276 --> 01:23:38.568 line:80%
I'm bleeding inside.
Heavy emergency.

1696
01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:39.610 line:80%
What?

1697
01:23:39.693 --> 01:23:40.610 line:80%
We need the OTP sir.

1698
01:23:40.735 --> 01:23:41.776 line:80%
Which OTP?

1699
01:23:41.901 --> 01:23:42.776 line:80%
BMS OTP, sir.

1700
01:23:42.818 --> 01:23:44.068 line:80%
You'll receive a four-digit
code to your phone.

1701
01:23:44.151 --> 01:23:46.401 line:80%
Is this Aha OTP?
To send it whenever you feel like it?

1702
01:23:46.526 --> 01:23:48.860 line:80%
No, sir, not that OTP.
It's your bank OTP. Please send it.

1703
01:23:48.985 --> 01:23:50.985 line:80%
-It's not going to happen.
-Sir, we are in love.

1704
01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:53.193 line:80%
You know everything, sir.
Expenses are increasing.

1705
01:23:53.235 --> 01:23:54.860 line:80%
Since you two young
lovebirds are in love,

1706
01:23:54.943 --> 01:23:56.568 line:80%
we'll understand and
keep your secrets to ourselves.

1707
01:23:56.651 --> 01:23:58.776 line:80%
If you help us with a big heart,

1708
01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.526 line:80%
Congratulations, Kalyani.

1709
01:24:01.485 --> 01:24:03.193 line:80%
Why are you congratulating her?

1710
01:24:03.235 --> 01:24:05.151 line:80%
Didn't you tell him?
She is pregnant, sir.

1711
01:24:05.485 --> 01:24:06.901 line:80%
Pregnancy?

1712
01:24:08.485 --> 01:24:10.443 line:80%
Why didn't you tell me?

1713
01:24:10.485 --> 01:24:12.068 line:80%
How can she tell, sir?
You are the one who made her pregnant.

1714
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:13.568 line:80%
They feel feverish when they imagine it.

1715
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:17.068 line:80%
Hey! I'll share the OTP on WhatsApp,
you go now.

1716
01:24:17.235 --> 01:24:18.693 line:80%
-Okay, sir. Okay, sir.
-Get out.

1717
01:24:18.735 --> 01:24:19.818 line:80%
Name the child after me.

1718
01:24:19.943 --> 01:24:21.151 line:80%
Kalyani!

1719
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:24.485 line:80%
I didn't do anything.

1720
01:24:24.568 --> 01:24:26.443 line:80%
Sir, gender reveal party!

1721
01:24:26.776 --> 01:24:28.860 line:80%
Hey! I'll send it.

1722
01:24:29.485 --> 01:24:31.026 line:80%
I'm not feeling good about this.

1723
01:24:31.068 --> 01:24:32.985 line:80%
Just yesterday we made a bill
for one lakh at the pub.

1724
01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:36.276 line:80%
-The brigade is already here.
-Don't worry. Listen to me.

1725
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.318 line:80%
-Got it?
-Hey, Purva.

1726
01:24:37.443 --> 01:24:39.193 line:80%
-Hi, all!
-Hi, bro.

1727
01:24:39.318 --> 01:24:40.860 line:80%
You didn't bring your friends?

1728
01:24:41.068 --> 01:24:42.485 line:80%
I don't have a gang of friends like you.

1729
01:24:42.526 --> 01:24:44.526 line:80%
I only have one friend,
he's as good as a gang.

1730
01:24:44.568 --> 01:24:45.443 line:80%
She is his girlfriend.

1731
01:24:45.526 --> 01:24:47.401 line:80%
-She is my girlfriend.
-Yes, his girlfriend. Girlfriend!

1732
01:24:47.485 --> 01:24:49.026 line:80%
-Hi! Hi!
-Hello!

1733
01:24:49.151 --> 01:24:53.360 line:80%
You're all Purva's friends.
So you can order anything you want.

1734
01:24:53.443 --> 01:24:55.235 line:80%
-They also have pancakes?
-Yes, for you.

1735
01:24:55.276 --> 01:24:56.151 line:80%
You should go and sit on the stove.

1736
01:24:56.193 --> 01:24:57.193 line:80%
I'll pay for the money.

1737
01:24:57.318 --> 01:24:59.151 line:80%
Because you are all Purva's friends,
you're like my friends, too.

1738
01:24:59.235 --> 01:25:00.068 line:80%
Go. Go.

1739
01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:01.110 line:80%
Yeah!

1740
01:25:01.235 --> 01:25:02.151 line:80%
Thank you, bro.

1741
01:25:02.276 --> 01:25:04.360 line:80%
Go, go, you pig.
My shirt's getting messed up, leave.

1742
01:25:07.151 --> 01:25:11.360 line:80%
Oh my god! 450 rupees for one combo?

1743
01:25:11.401 --> 01:25:13.610 line:80%
Purva, you want something
special like ice cream with nuts?

1744
01:25:13.651 --> 01:25:15.818 line:80%
-I'll just get a coke.
-Cool drinks are not good for health.

1745
01:25:15.943 --> 01:25:18.693 line:80%
As a manager if I think like this,

1746
01:25:18.776 --> 01:25:22.901 line:80%
how can someone who works under me
afford this with his family?

1747
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:26.193 line:80%
-Can you get me a bottle of water?
-Okay, sir.

1748
01:25:27.901 --> 01:25:29.693 line:80%
Find out who this is?

1749
01:25:29.818 --> 01:25:31.401 line:80%
Hey!

1750
01:25:31.651 --> 01:25:32.526 line:80%
You!

1751
01:25:33.151 --> 01:25:34.526 line:80%
What are you doing here?

1752
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:36.151 line:80%
We came to watch a movie.

1753
01:25:43.568 --> 01:25:45.193 line:80%
Wait a moment I've got a message.

1754
01:25:47.193 --> 01:25:48.776 line:80%
What? 18000?!

1755
01:25:48.818 --> 01:25:50.526 line:80%
Did Kalyani not come with you, sir?

1756
01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:52.360 line:80%
Kalyani? Who is Kalyani?

1757
01:25:52.443 --> 01:25:55.026 line:80%
-Who is she, sir? Your neighbor?
-She's my wife...

1758
01:25:55.068 --> 01:25:56.318 line:80%
-Oh gosh!
-Who is Kalyani?

1759
01:25:56.526 --> 01:25:59.235 line:80%
Just shut up.
Kalyani is a boy, not a girl.

1760
01:25:59.276 --> 01:26:01.901 line:80%
My friend, Kalyani Priyadarshan.

1761
01:26:01.943 --> 01:26:03.610 line:80%
-He's from Kerala.
-He's a good actor.

1762
01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:04.485 line:80%
Her dance is graceful.

1763
01:26:04.568 --> 01:26:07.693 line:80%
-He is not an actor. Director.
-Right. Her father. Good director.

1764
01:26:07.776 --> 01:26:09.276 line:80%
-Really?
-You're a very good couple.

1765
01:26:09.318 --> 01:26:11.110 line:80%
That is not she. He.

1766
01:26:11.193 --> 01:26:12.526 line:80%
Sir...Sir...at least, have some popcorn.

1767
01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:15.235 line:80%
Ma'am, you didn't take anything.
At least, have popcorn.

1768
01:26:15.485 --> 01:26:18.151 line:80%
-She'll not eat outside.
-It's on the house.

1769
01:26:18.193 --> 01:26:21.818 line:80%
You won't buy and won't let others buy.
What is your problem if he pays?

1770
01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.610 line:80%
-Thank you.
-You don't know them fully, dear.

1771
01:26:24.693 --> 01:26:25.318 line:80%
Please come.

1772
01:26:25.401 --> 01:26:26.610 line:80%
Please increase the limit, sir.

1773
01:26:26.693 --> 01:26:27.735 line:80%
-The money isn't enough.
-Okay, bye.

1774
01:26:27.818 --> 01:26:28.610 line:80%
Bye.

1775
01:26:30.235 --> 01:26:32.443 line:80%
Purva you might slip, be careful.
Go slowly dear.

1776
01:26:32.735 --> 01:26:34.693 line:80%
Yeah, Rishi.
Even I thought the same.

1777
01:26:34.943 --> 01:26:36.151 line:80%
Popcorn?

1778
01:26:37.276 --> 01:26:39.068 line:80%
I'll give it to you later.
You need it now? Take it.

1779
01:26:40.026 --> 01:26:41.318 line:80%
Why are you sitting there,
we'll sit here.

1780
01:26:41.401 --> 01:26:42.860 line:80%
Someone else reserved it.

1781
01:26:42.943 --> 01:26:45.318 line:80%
It's just the next seat, right?
Let's tell them to leave, come on.

1782
01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:47.901 line:80%
-I'm so excited!
-This is the first time

1783
01:26:47.943 --> 01:26:50.110 line:80%
we're coming to a movie with girlfriends.

1784
01:26:52.526 --> 01:26:55.860 line:80%
You look like
Rashmika from the side.

1785
01:26:55.943 --> 01:26:57.901 line:80%
God! He is irritating me.

1786
01:26:58.651 --> 01:27:00.485 line:80%
What's the perfume?
Chanel?

1787
01:27:02.151 --> 01:27:03.610 line:80%
Yeah!

1788
01:27:03.776 --> 01:27:05.651 line:80%
-Yay!
-The jealous master has come out again.

1789
01:27:05.901 --> 01:27:07.651 line:80%
Icon star!

1790
01:27:08.026 --> 01:27:10.568 line:80%
I can happily romance with
my girlfriend now.

1791
01:27:16.651 --> 01:27:18.526 line:80%
Do you think this is a theater?
Or Kuyo room?

1792
01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:19.610 line:80%
Watch the movie first.

1793
01:27:21.776 --> 01:27:24.443 line:80%
-Sir, this is my seat.
-Let's go to corner seats after interval.

1794
01:27:24.485 --> 01:27:25.360 line:80%
That part. That part.

1795
01:27:25.485 --> 01:27:27.901 line:80%
We're all couples.
So can you go back and sit please?

1796
01:27:27.985 --> 01:27:30.401 line:80%
Because "Feelings" songs is coming.
And we want to feel with our couples.

1797
01:27:30.485 --> 01:27:31.735 line:80%
Hello!

1798
01:27:32.026 --> 01:27:33.068 line:80%
Hey!

1799
01:27:33.151 --> 01:27:35.401 line:80%
Will you get up, or do you want me to
call the staff?

1800
01:27:35.443 --> 01:27:36.818 line:80%
How's she following me everywhere?

1801
01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:38.068 line:80%
Thank god you didn't
call the cops.

1802
01:27:38.110 --> 01:27:39.276 line:80%
-Move.

-Just like that.
-You idiot!

1807
01:27:50.443 --> 01:27:52.360 line:80%
-Movie is playing over there.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1808
01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:54.360 line:80%
Dirty face! If I get crazy...

1809
01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:57.860 line:80%
Purva. I can't remember
the second half in part one.

1810
01:27:57.943 --> 01:27:59.735 line:80%
Hey, I remember that.
Should I tell you?

1811
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:03.193 line:80%
♪ Your looks have become
As pricey as gold ♪

1812
01:28:03.235 --> 01:28:04.443 line:80%
I need to pee. Let's go.

1813
01:28:06.235 --> 01:28:08.526 line:80%
Over there.

1814
01:28:10.526 --> 01:28:12.651 line:80%
Purva...Just say it.

1815
01:28:12.735 --> 01:28:14.485 line:80%
What is it, dude?
What's with her calling the staff?

1816
01:28:14.818 --> 01:28:17.068 line:80%
I can't even watch the movie peacefully.

1817
01:28:17.151 --> 01:28:18.901 line:80%
Come on, let's get two Dil pasand.

1818
01:28:18.985 --> 01:28:20.110 line:80%
-Get it.
-Get lost!

1819
01:28:23.943 --> 01:28:25.901 line:80%

Did you come for surgery?

1820
01:28:25.985 --> 01:28:28.568 line:80%
No. Knee implant surgery is finished.

1821
01:28:28.735 --> 01:28:31.318 line:80%
The doctor asked us to come
for a follow-up every two weeks.

1822
01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.776 line:80%
I, too, need the same surgery.

1823
01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:37.568 line:80%
I feel sad to spend
ten lakhs for surgery at this age.

1824
01:28:37.651 --> 01:28:39.276 line:80%
Don't you have insurance, ma'am?

1825
01:28:39.318 --> 01:28:41.735 line:80%
The insurance covers five lakhs.

1826
01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:44.110 line:80%
I have to arrange the remaining
five lakhs myself.

1827
01:28:45.943 --> 01:28:47.485 line:80%
-Excuse me.
-Yes, ma'am.

1828
01:28:47.568 --> 01:28:49.318 line:80%
Could you please explain this bill to me?

1829
01:28:49.443 --> 01:28:50.860 line:80%
Yeah. Give me a second.

1830
01:28:52.651 --> 01:28:54.901 line:80%
-They charged ten lakhs, ma'am.
-No.

1831
01:28:56.110 --> 01:28:58.068 line:80%
But my insurance covers only five lakh.

1832
01:28:58.485 --> 01:28:59.818 line:80%
One second. I'll check.

1833
01:29:01.318 --> 01:29:02.360 line:80%
No, ma'am.

1834
01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:04.276 line:80%
Vijay, an SDFC executive,

1835
01:29:04.401 --> 01:29:06.943 line:80%
upgraded your insurance
policy to ten lakhs.

1836
01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.318 line:80%
-Vijay?
-Yes, ma'am.

1837
01:29:40.943 --> 01:29:42.776 line:80%
Happy birthday to...

1838
01:29:43.193 --> 01:29:44.318 line:80%
Gayathri!

1839
01:29:45.610 --> 01:29:48.193 line:80%
Happy birthday to Gayathri.

1840
01:29:48.651 --> 01:29:50.818 line:80%
-Happy birthday...
-What're you doing, dude?

1841
01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.318 line:80%
Someone's spying on me.

1842
01:29:54.485 --> 01:29:57.568 line:80%
That shorty is coming to know about
everything I'm doing with Purva.

1843
01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:58.901 line:80%
What's that?

1844
01:29:58.985 --> 01:30:01.026 line:80%
It's a bug detector.
Have you seen this in
Dhruva
movie?

1845
01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.318 line:80%
Who would invest so much on you?

1846
01:30:03.401 --> 01:30:05.985 line:80%
You can't trust
the technology these days.

1847
01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.068 line:80%
They could do anything.

1848
01:30:08.901 --> 01:30:10.068 line:80%
Watch it.
You!

1849
01:30:10.401 --> 01:30:12.651 line:80%
-What about me?
-Tripod.

1850
01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:17.360 line:80%
This will remain turned on.
Let me know if you doubt something.

1851
01:30:17.568 --> 01:30:19.151 line:80%
It'll sound the signals.

1852
01:30:19.901 --> 01:30:21.360 line:80%
I need to meet Purva.

1853
01:30:21.485 --> 01:30:22.693 line:80%
-Where to?
-To the park.

1854
01:30:22.901 --> 01:30:24.735 line:80%
-Which one?
-Botanical.

1855
01:30:26.943 --> 01:30:29.610 line:80%
Happy birthday to Gayathri.

1856
01:30:30.068 --> 01:30:32.610 line:80%
Manager's card is with him. Okay.

1857
01:30:35.026 --> 01:30:38.693 line:80%
Harini, he just left to meet Purva
at the Botanical Garden. Roger that. Over.

1858
01:30:38.735 --> 01:30:39.985 line:80%
Copy. Over.

1859
01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:48.193 line:80%
Sure. I'm leaving then.

1860
01:30:48.318 --> 01:30:50.235 line:80%
Make the most of it, okay?

1861
01:30:54.318 --> 01:30:55.568 line:80%
Why?

1862
01:30:59.026 --> 01:31:03.610 line:80%
Since childhood...

1863
01:31:04.776 --> 01:31:06.526 line:80%
A... Aravind!

1864
01:31:06.776 --> 01:31:09.193 line:80%
I thought
you were a good person like Allu Aravind.

1865
01:31:09.276 --> 01:31:10.151 line:80%
I'm a good guy only, dude.

1866
01:31:10.235 --> 01:31:14.651 line:80%
But I didn't expect you to be
Aravind Swami from
Dhruva
movie.

1867
01:31:14.693 --> 01:31:16.276 line:80%
-Listen to--
-Shut up!

1868
01:31:16.735 --> 01:31:18.776 line:80%
I expected someone to bug me. But...

1869
01:31:19.985 --> 01:31:24.235 line:80%
I couldn't guess all this was
because of you, bloody burger!

1870
01:31:24.401 --> 01:31:26.068 line:80%
Can I get you a burger from
Vac's pastries? Heard it's good.

1871
01:31:26.110 --> 01:31:27.443 line:80%
Shut up!

1872
01:31:27.568 --> 01:31:31.068 line:80%
They mention pigeons and parrots
in the history, but...

1873
01:31:31.235 --> 01:31:34.193 line:80%
none mentioned a crow like you!

1874
01:31:34.735 --> 01:31:37.110 line:80%
Tell me. Tell me!

1875
01:31:37.193 --> 01:31:39.276 line:80%
Tell me. Why did you do this?
Tell me!

1876
01:31:39.318 --> 01:31:39.943 line:80%
Leave me.

1877
01:31:40.026 --> 01:31:41.776 line:80%
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1878
01:31:43.068 --> 01:31:46.735 line:80%
Whoever wrote Aurangazeb was great
in the books are people like you.

1879
01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:48.068 line:80%
Die, you idiot!

1880
01:31:48.193 --> 01:31:50.735 line:80%
-Tell me!
-Har har mahadev!

1881
01:31:50.776 --> 01:31:51.901 line:80%
-Get lost!
-Hey!

1882
01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:53.568 line:80%
Hey, wait!
Aravind, wait!

1883
01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:05.235 line:80%
This is the best.

1884
01:32:05.401 --> 01:32:06.693 line:80%
My knee got hurt.

1885
01:32:07.693 --> 01:32:08.610 line:80%
Hi!

1886
01:32:10.568 --> 01:32:11.776 line:80%
I'm beautiful.

1887
01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:14.193 line:80%
Wish my husband leaves early today.

1888
01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.776 line:80%
She's happy with her phone.
There's no need for the husband.

1889
01:32:17.318 --> 01:32:19.568 line:80%
I heard someone else is coming home
after I leave for office.

1890
01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.610 line:80%
Don't suspect without proof.

1891
01:32:21.776 --> 01:32:24.401 line:80%
Because of you, the gas and milkmen
stopped coming this way.

1892
01:32:24.443 --> 01:32:26.568 line:80%
So? Will you invite
just about anyone inside the house?

1893
01:32:26.735 --> 01:32:28.318 line:80%
You stopped thinking about me.

1894
01:32:28.735 --> 01:32:32.026 line:80%
Who's this guy? How dare he
enter the house when I'm right here?

1895
01:32:32.068 --> 01:32:33.360 line:80%
What's he searching for?

1896
01:32:33.401 --> 01:32:34.276 line:80%
Am I caught?

1897
01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:36.735 line:80%
Come! Come!
Come out!

1898
01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:38.318 line:80%
Did you hide another under the bed?

1899
01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.318 line:80%
Hey! Hey!

1900
01:32:39.526 --> 01:32:41.110 line:80%
I have no clue who this is either, dear.

1901
01:32:41.235 --> 01:32:42.818 line:80%
-Where?
-Stop.

1902
01:32:43.776 --> 01:32:45.485 line:80%
Harini is gold! Don't miss her.

1903
01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:48.360 line:80%
You said you didn't know him?
But he's certifying you as gold?

1904
01:32:48.401 --> 01:32:49.901 line:80%
-Is your wife's name too, Harini?
-Yes.

1905
01:32:49.943 --> 01:32:52.651 line:80%
-Never knew that.
-You morons! Who the hell are you?

1906
01:32:52.693 --> 01:32:53.526 line:80%
Wait!

1907
01:32:54.026 --> 01:32:56.526 line:80%
I'm just the Superman. Batman
is under the bed in the Gotham City.

1908
01:32:56.568 --> 01:32:57.818 line:80%
-Batman?
-You ruined everything.

1909
01:32:57.901 --> 01:32:59.735 line:80%
-Hey! Wait!
-I'll choke you to death!

1910
01:33:01.318 --> 01:33:02.818 line:80%
Hey! Stop there!

1911
01:33:03.068 --> 01:33:05.610 line:80%
Hey! Stop!
Stop you pirate of the Caribbean!

1912
01:33:05.776 --> 01:33:07.026 line:80%
I cannot. I'm man on the fire.

1913
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:09.318 line:80%
How dare you mess with
my Game of Thrones? Stop.

1914
01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.568 line:80%
-Winter is coming, dude.
-Hey!

1915
01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:11.985 line:80%
Shut up and stop.

1916
01:33:12.151 --> 01:33:13.985 line:80%
-Oh my!
-I'm throwing the knife.

1917
01:33:14.026 --> 01:33:15.276 line:80%
With his hit, I will be done for the day.

1918
01:33:15.443 --> 01:33:16.901 line:80%
Better if I escape to Mirzapur.

1919
01:33:23.776 --> 01:33:25.776 line:80%
Where the hell are you, Aravind?
Come outside.

1920
01:33:26.026 --> 01:33:28.068 line:80%
Gayathri is in the hospital
with loose motions.

1921
01:33:28.526 --> 01:33:29.235 line:80%
Yes?

1922
01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.485 line:80%
Have you seen a crazy guy
in an underwear?

1923
01:33:31.568 --> 01:33:33.901 line:80%
-No, bro.
-Serve the needy. Always!

1924
01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:35.651 line:80%
He'll take care.

1925
01:33:36.151 --> 01:33:38.485 line:80%
-Sorry, sister. Sorry.
-God bless you, my child.

1926

♪ This gold is old
Didn't you buy new? ♪

1927

-What's Vijay wearing?

1929

You've no clue what dress I'm wearing.

1930
01:33:50.151 --> 01:33:51.985 line:80%
Hang up now.
My life is at risk because of you.

What's wrong, bro?
Hello?

1932
01:33:55.401 --> 01:33:56.401 line:80%
You're right here.
Huh?

1933
01:33:59.568 --> 01:34:01.985 line:80%
I'm sparing you
because you're wearing a mum's dress.

1934
01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.193 line:80%
-Not mum but Nun.
-Shut up!

1935
01:34:04.276 --> 01:34:05.485 line:80%
You're hurting me.

1936
01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.151 line:80%
Who is Harini? Isn't she
your Dad's illegitimate daughter?

1937
01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:11.985 line:80%
You thought the guy is handsome
and earns well.

1938
01:34:12.151 --> 01:34:14.401 line:80%
So you decided
to get me married to her, right?

1939
01:34:14.485 --> 01:34:15.485 line:80%
Hey, stop it!

1940
01:34:15.943 --> 01:34:17.943 line:80%
I'm okay with you
hitting me for what I did.

1941
01:34:18.318 --> 01:34:21.110 line:80%
But don't use the same reason to give
yourself imaginary value. You have none.

1942
01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.526 line:80%
-Who the hell is Harini, then?
-Hey, stop it.

1943
01:34:22.985 --> 01:34:24.818 line:80%
Harini is to Gayathri like you're to me.

1944
01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:28.151 line:80%
Remember I introduced you to Gayathri
at the metro station?

1945
01:34:28.235 --> 01:34:30.443 line:80%
It was intended for Harini to meet you.

1946
01:34:30.735 --> 01:34:32.235 line:80%
But that day, you saw Purva.

1947
01:34:32.776 --> 01:34:34.818 line:80%
She was confused how to approach you

1948
01:34:34.943 --> 01:34:36.943 line:80%
and asked me for help
and Gayathri pushed me.

1949
01:34:37.568 --> 01:34:39.818 line:80%
She blackmailed saying
love is greater than friendship.

1950
01:34:42.026 --> 01:34:44.651 line:80%
See Aravind. Vijay must forget Purva.

1951
01:34:44.943 --> 01:34:46.651 line:80%
Or I'll be forgetting you.

1952
01:34:47.401 --> 01:34:48.901 line:80%
-Do you want that?
-No.

1953
01:34:49.193 --> 01:34:51.818 line:80%
We were plotting new plans
to bring you and Harini close.

1954
01:34:52.318 --> 01:34:55.818 line:80%
We aren't that intelligent.
So we just copied yours.

1955
01:34:56.276 --> 01:34:57.985 line:80%
We didn't even give credit to you.

1956
01:34:58.110 --> 01:35:01.235 line:80%
You know the crazy episode after that.

1957
01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:03.693 line:80%
Yeah. Okay.

1958
01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:24.610 line:80%
Our bond of friendship...

1959
01:35:25.443 --> 01:35:27.818 line:80%
You've killed it with pesticide.

1960
01:35:28.235 --> 01:35:29.860 line:80%
You seem ignorant of plantology.

1961
01:35:29.985 --> 01:35:32.235 line:80%
Pesticides help plants grow.
They won't kill them.

1962
01:35:32.276 --> 01:35:33.526 line:80%
Hey!
Purva asked me to come.

1963
01:35:33.568 --> 01:35:34.818 line:80%
-Don't tell me.
-I'm going.

1964
01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.276 line:80%
Find out where Harini is.
I'll see her end today.

1965
01:35:37.901 --> 01:35:39.610 line:80%
God bless you, my child!

1966
01:35:58.693 --> 01:36:00.276 line:80%
Why did you hide this from me?

1967
01:36:01.026 --> 01:36:02.568 line:80%
Did she find out about Harini?

1968
01:36:03.068 --> 01:36:05.193 line:80%
Actually... Purva...

1969
01:36:05.735 --> 01:36:09.068 line:80%
Harini pretended that
she came to me for a policy.

1970
01:36:09.151 --> 01:36:12.193 line:80%
I only found out that
she loved me on Valentine's Day.

1971
01:36:12.318 --> 01:36:14.693 line:80%
Even I didn't understand
how to tell you that.

1972
01:36:14.818 --> 01:36:17.360 line:80%
Because she always
used to say about you,

1973
01:36:17.693 --> 01:36:20.651 line:80%
that your love for me isn't genuine,
that it's fake,

1974
01:36:20.735 --> 01:36:22.943 line:80%
that you're deliberately making me
spend money on you.

1975
01:36:23.026 --> 01:36:24.610 line:80%
She told me a lot of such things.

1976
01:36:24.651 --> 01:36:26.943 line:80%
Even I didn't understand
how to tell you such things.

1977
01:36:27.151 --> 01:36:28.318 line:80%
That's why I kept all this from you.

1978
01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.360 line:80%
Otherwise, I had no
intention of hiding it, Purva.

1979
01:36:33.193 --> 01:36:34.026 line:80%
Hey...

1980
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:35.110 line:80%
don't feel bad.

1981
01:36:35.193 --> 01:36:37.735 line:80%
Oh, no!
Why are you crying?

1982
01:36:37.901 --> 01:36:39.735 line:80%
-Vijay...
-Yes.

1983
01:36:40.151 --> 01:36:41.943 line:80%
What Harini said is true.

1984
01:36:42.401 --> 01:36:45.860 line:80%
Until now, I've only
acted like I loved you.

1985
01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:52.860 line:80%
Even though I tortured you so much,
you continued to love me.

1986
01:36:53.985 --> 01:36:57.276 line:80%
Despite helping so much
with my mom's surgery,

1987
01:36:58.443 --> 01:37:00.901 line:80%
you never mentioned that to me.

1988
01:37:01.776 --> 01:37:08.651 line:80%
From that day onwards,
I truly started loving you.

1989
01:37:10.985 --> 01:37:13.401 line:80%
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh no!

1990
01:37:13.568 --> 01:37:15.735 line:80%
-I love you, Vijay.
-Don't cry! Thank you.

1991
01:37:15.818 --> 01:37:17.443 line:80%
Stop crying first.
I can't see you like that.

1992
01:37:17.735 --> 01:37:19.610 line:80%
Please. I can't bear to watch girls cry.

1993
01:37:19.735 --> 01:37:20.693 line:80%
Smile.

1994
01:37:20.818 --> 01:37:21.860 line:80%
Smile.

1995
01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:37.443 line:80%
-Hello?
-Vijay, I found out where Harini is.

1996
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:39.151 line:80%
-Where is she?
-She's near Naresh Steel Shop.

1997
01:37:39.235 --> 01:37:40.693 line:80%
Send me the address.
She's done for today.

1998
01:37:40.818 --> 01:37:42.443 line:80%
She's a good girl.
Be a little careful with her.

1999
01:37:42.526 --> 01:37:44.193 line:80%
Send me the location. I'll go
to her home and deal with her.

2000
01:37:44.276 --> 01:37:45.276 line:80%
Cut the call now.

2001
01:38:08.276 --> 01:38:10.776 line:80%
Harini... in this house...

2002
01:38:16.235 --> 01:38:17.235 line:80%
Mr. Murthy...

2003
01:38:17.401 --> 01:38:21.151 line:80%
Our friendship is an example
of age not mattering in friendship.

2004
01:38:21.276 --> 01:38:24.443 line:80%
A bar is one of the few places
where we can be ourselves.

2005
01:38:24.610 --> 01:38:28.776 line:80%
That's why friendships formed there
are so deeply rooted.

2006
01:38:28.901 --> 01:38:31.193 line:80%
He's a typical middle-class person

2007
01:38:31.276 --> 01:38:34.360 line:80%
who calculates current and
future hardships to live.

2008
01:38:34.526 --> 01:38:38.776 line:80%
That's why he hates debt or owing
even a single rupee to anyone.

2009
01:38:39.443 --> 01:38:40.693 line:80%
Hey, Vijay!

2010
01:38:40.776 --> 01:38:43.235 line:80%
What kind of crazy moves
are you performing?

2011
01:38:43.318 --> 01:38:44.318 line:80%
Come on!

2012
01:38:45.235 --> 01:38:47.026 line:80%
What's up, boy?
Tell me now.

2013
01:38:47.401 --> 01:38:49.860 line:80%
Guruji, you haven't paid your EMI
for six months.

2014
01:38:49.943 --> 01:38:51.443 line:80%
How long can I manage this?

2015
01:38:51.526 --> 01:38:54.568 line:80%
Usually, the file goes to
the collection agent

2016
01:38:54.735 --> 01:38:56.860 line:80%
after five months of unpaid EMIs.

2017
01:38:57.610 --> 01:39:00.735 line:80%
So, did you pay those
five months of EMI?

2018
01:39:02.693 --> 01:39:07.193 line:80%
So I don't have to pay
for another five months. Right?

2019
01:39:07.318 --> 01:39:10.860 line:80%
On this happy occasion,
drink whatever you want today.

2020
01:39:11.068 --> 01:39:12.651 line:80%
I'm taking care of the whole bill.

2021
01:39:12.776 --> 01:39:16.026 line:80%
Why are you kidding me?
I paid by taking a personal loan.

2022
01:39:16.235 --> 01:39:18.943 line:80%
The bridegroom's family is coming to
see the girl tomorrow.

2023
01:39:18.985 --> 01:39:21.943 line:80%
As soon as that is over,
I'll bring my daughter's jewelry

2024
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:24.693 line:80%
and mortgage it at your bank
and start paying EMIs.

2025
01:39:25.276 --> 01:39:29.901 line:80%
-Do you have a lover?
-I'm single, sir.

2026
01:39:30.026 --> 01:39:32.110 line:80%
Huh?!
You are single?

2027
01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.360 line:80%
I knew it when you started
drinking with me every day.

2028
01:39:35.526 --> 01:39:37.485 line:80%
I knew you were a single goofball guy.

2029
01:39:37.901 --> 01:39:39.026 line:80%
Stop here.

2030
01:39:39.318 --> 01:39:41.235 line:80%
Go home happily.
Good night.

2031
01:39:41.443 --> 01:39:42.985 line:80%
Boss...Boss...
Careful, boss.

2032
01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:44.610 line:80%
It's alright.

2033
01:39:44.776 --> 01:39:46.276 line:80%
I love you!

2034
01:39:47.151 --> 01:39:47.901 line:80%
Booze breath!

2035
01:39:47.943 --> 01:39:49.235 line:80%
-Good night.
-Good night.

2036
01:40:23.110 --> 01:40:27.651 line:80%
He even took a personal loan for me
and paid our EMIs.

2037
01:40:28.026 --> 01:40:31.526 line:80%
As soon as our land is sold, I will get
your gold from the mortgage

2038
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:32.860 line:80%
and return it to you.

2039
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.151 line:80%
Oh, don't worry, Dad.

2040
01:40:35.318 --> 01:40:37.151 line:80%
First, you return the due amount to him.

2041
01:40:37.401 --> 01:40:40.068 line:80%
Tell him I told him thanks.
Love you, Dad.

2042
01:40:51.693 --> 01:40:53.026 line:80%
-Hello, Guru.
-Hey, Vijay.

2043
01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.235 line:80%
-Where are you?
-Over here.

2044
01:40:55.651 --> 01:40:57.026 line:80%
Hey!

2045
01:41:00.235 --> 01:41:01.360 line:80%
I'm coming. Hold on.

2046
01:41:01.526 --> 01:41:03.151 line:80%
Hey! Don't come here.

2047
01:41:03.276 --> 01:41:04.860 line:80%
-I'm coming to you.
-Alright.

2048
01:41:14.443 --> 01:41:15.943 line:80%
Watch your back, boss!

2049
01:41:16.401 --> 01:41:17.610 line:80%
What is it?

2050
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:19.193 line:80%
Behind you!

2051
01:41:19.735 --> 01:41:21.193 line:80%
What are you saying?

2052
01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:23.985 line:80%
What?

2053
01:41:25.443 --> 01:41:26.276 line:80%
What?

2054
01:41:28.776 --> 01:41:31.026 line:80%
I'm coming. Stay right there.

2055
01:43:00.776 --> 01:43:02.526 line:80%
You know my dad. Don't you?

2056
01:43:03.943 --> 01:43:07.110 line:80%
After my father passed away,
the prospective match

2057
01:43:07.235 --> 01:43:09.693 line:80%
left me saying
my horoscope was not good.

2058
01:43:09.818 --> 01:43:13.610 line:80%
A few days later,
you came to our house.

2059
01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.943 line:80%
Sir's housing insurance is still active.

2060
01:43:18.318 --> 01:43:20.401 line:80%
Starting this month,
you don't have to pay the EMI.

2061
01:43:20.526 --> 01:43:21.860 line:80%
Here's my visiting card.

2062
01:43:22.026 --> 01:43:24.443 line:80%
Please feel free to ask
if you need anything.

2063
01:43:24.818 --> 01:43:25.651 line:80%
See you.

2064
01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:39.401 line:80%
I didn't have the courage to
directly propose to you, Vijay.

2065
01:43:39.485 --> 01:43:42.735 line:80%

What are you thinking
so much about?

2070
01:44:00.401 --> 01:44:01.526 line:80%
Poor Harini.

I feel pity for her

2072

01:45:35.235 --> 01:45:36.151 line:80%
Vijay?

2087
01:45:39.693 --> 01:45:44.026 line:80%
What's wrong? You aren't answering calls.
Nor are you replying to messages.

2088
01:45:46.776 --> 01:45:48.318 line:80%
Any problem?

2089
01:45:48.818 --> 01:45:50.776 line:80%
Actually, Purva...

2090
01:45:52.651 --> 01:45:54.318 line:80%
I need to tell you something.

2091
01:46:07.443 --> 01:46:11.735 line:80%
I was shocked to find out
Harini is Mr. Murthy's daughter.

2092
01:46:13.651 --> 01:46:16.818 line:80%
I, too, hold a responsibility towards
Mr. Murthy's family.

2093
01:46:17.276 --> 01:46:18.193 line:80%
So?

2094
01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.693 line:80%
What about us, Vijay?

2095
01:46:21.068 --> 01:46:22.401 line:80%
Yes, Purva...

2096
01:46:24.068 --> 01:46:25.818 line:80%
Whenever I think about you...

2097
01:46:27.901 --> 01:46:29.610 line:80%
I can only remember Harini's family.

2098
01:46:31.568 --> 01:46:32.610 line:80%
But that's wrong.

2099
01:46:45.401 --> 01:46:49.193 line:80%
It's difficult for a girl to
generate love for a guy.

2100
01:46:49.901 --> 01:46:52.276 line:80%
We have no issues between us.

2101
01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:55.151 line:80%
But we are in this situation now.

2102
01:46:56.485 --> 01:46:58.776 line:80%
More than me being in your life...

2103
01:47:01.610 --> 01:47:04.568 line:80%
you being in her life is correct.

2104
01:47:05.901 --> 01:47:07.735 line:80%
After knowing all this,

2105
01:47:08.026 --> 01:47:09.860 line:80%
even if you're with me,

2106
01:47:10.026 --> 01:47:14.485 line:80%
I don't think our relationship
would remain the same.

2107
01:47:14.776 --> 01:47:15.610 line:80%
Bye, Vijay.

2108
01:47:32.526 --> 01:47:34.985 line:80%
I came eagerly as soon as you
called me. I don't understand anything.

2109
01:47:35.276 --> 01:47:36.526 line:80%
My head is about to explode.

2110
01:47:37.276 --> 01:47:39.651 line:80%
-If this is correct--
-Hey!

2111
01:47:39.818 --> 01:47:41.735 line:80%
Don't think too much about it, buddy.
I'm begging you.

2112
01:47:41.818 --> 01:47:44.235 line:80%
Purva's chapter is closed.
A new chapter has begun.

2113
01:47:44.443 --> 01:47:45.776 line:80%
Harini is madly in love with you, dude.

2114
01:47:45.985 --> 01:47:47.818 line:80%
Why is she calling you here?
It's definitely to propose.

2115
01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.235 line:80%
Accept it right away.
Please.

2116
01:48:09.193 --> 01:48:11.776 line:80%
-Who's this?
-I think he's the trainer, dude.

2117
01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:13.985 line:80%
Girls are hanging out
with their trainers these days.

2118
01:48:14.068 --> 01:48:16.443 line:80%
If she gets us to meet,
we'll join his class.

2119
01:48:16.568 --> 01:48:18.443 line:80%
She'll get the training for free.
A pyramid scheme.

2120
01:48:29.193 --> 01:48:30.776 line:80%
What are you looking at, man?

2121
01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.235 line:80%
-Hi.
-Hi, Harini.

2122
01:48:36.401 --> 01:48:38.651 line:80%
Hi. Who is he?
Your Pilates trainer?

2123
01:48:38.776 --> 01:48:39.818 line:80%
No, no. He's not.

2124
01:48:39.985 --> 01:48:42.151 line:80%
Brother?
No, you don't look alike. Cousins...?

2125
01:48:42.235 --> 01:48:43.110 line:80%
Uncle's son...?

2126
01:48:43.193 --> 01:48:47.443 line:80%
You know that a match came for me.
He is that same guy.

2127
01:48:49.026 --> 01:48:54.193 line:80%
When my parents fixed my marriage
with Harini, I was thrilled.

2128
01:49:05.943 --> 01:49:09.651 line:80%
I had to go to the US urgently for work
at that time.

2129
01:49:10.235 --> 01:49:12.651 line:80%
That's why I asked my parents to go
and talk to them personally.

2130
01:49:12.943 --> 01:49:14.860 line:80%
Before I returned from the US,

2131
01:49:15.235 --> 01:49:17.651 line:80%
I learned that Harini's father
died in an accident.

2132
01:49:17.985 --> 01:49:22.235 line:80%
At the same time,
my parents canceled the wedding.

2133
01:49:22.318 --> 01:49:24.860 line:80%
I was distraught, man.
I can understand.

2134
01:49:25.401 --> 01:49:28.693 line:80%
She must be very sad.
I can't ask about marriage at that time.

2135
01:49:28.901 --> 01:49:33.693 line:80%
So I waited until she became normal
and thought I'd express my love.

2136
01:49:33.818 --> 01:49:36.360 line:80%
By then, she had already
started loving you.

-Chasing.

2138
01:49:43.568 --> 01:49:46.318 line:80%
-That's what. I saw him.
-Watch out! Don't fall.

2139
01:49:46.693 --> 01:49:50.235 line:80%
That's why I started getting closer to her
without hiding my feelings.

2140
01:49:52.068 --> 01:49:54.485 line:80%

2141

But Nitin understood my situation and
gave me space.

You used to say that

2144
01:50:03.985 --> 01:50:05.610 line:80%

2145
01:50:05.943 --> 01:50:09.443 line:80%
-He used to say this.
-He says a lot of quotes like this.

2146

2147
01:50:12.026 --> 01:50:13.985 line:80%
-The date of our wedding is locked.
-Oh!

2148
01:50:14.235 --> 01:50:17.026 line:80%
That's why I brought
Nitin to introduce him to you.

2149

Nice to meet you, actually.

2151

Our day is your night.

2152
01:50:25.193 --> 01:50:26.318 line:80%

2153
01:50:26.443 --> 01:50:28.526 line:80%
-But congratulations.
-Thank you.

-Thank... Thank...

-Why does everyone zone me out?

2158
01:50:41.776 --> 01:50:43.610 line:80%
Hey! Listen to me.

2159

-Shall we go near Purva? I'll talk.
-What for?

2160
01:50:46.693 --> 01:50:48.193 line:80%
Actually...

2161
01:50:49.568 --> 01:50:50.860 line:80%
Let's call her, at least.

2162
01:50:51.276 --> 01:50:52.318 line:80%
We may sort it out.

2163
01:50:52.485 --> 01:50:54.443 line:80%
I have already called her
a hundred times and

2164
01:50:54.526 --> 01:50:55.568 line:80%
texted her fifty times shamelessly.

2165
01:50:55.651 --> 01:50:56.901 line:80%
You did? What did she say?

2166
01:50:57.901 --> 01:50:59.568 line:80%
-She blocked me.
-Block?

2167
01:51:01.568 --> 01:51:04.693 line:80%
I met Purva because I was confused

2168
01:51:04.985 --> 01:51:07.985 line:80%
and went to ask for a solution
to what would be best.

2169
01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:11.068 line:80%
But she told me Harini is right for me
and asked me to move on.

2170

And this shorty.

2171
01:51:12.818 --> 01:51:15.776 line:80%
She brought some random guy and
said she had found her life and true love.

2172
01:51:15.901 --> 01:51:18.068 line:80%
She blabbered something
and asked me to move on.

2173
01:51:18.276 --> 01:51:21.193 line:80%
Which can only mean...
Is moving on that easy?

2174
01:51:22.026 --> 01:51:23.818 line:80%
Maybe for the girls.

2175
01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.985 line:80%
It's really hard for us.

2176
01:51:26.568 --> 01:51:27.651 line:80%
I'm unable to take it.

2177

Maybe that's why,

2178

2182

I won't get drunk like that...

-Surya son of Krishnan.

2208

I saved all those secretly
and sent them to Gayathri.

By now, she would have
even gotten ready

2212
01:52:42.235 --> 01:52:43.443 line:80%
