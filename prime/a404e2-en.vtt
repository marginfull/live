You guys must be well off.

-He generates electricity.
-Yes.

99
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.633 line:82%
Shall we watch TV together?

100

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.467 line:82%
-It's this place.
-This place.

164
00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:47.600 line:82%
Around 7 p.m.,

165
00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:50.667 line:82%
she headed out after saying
that she was getting ramyeon

166
00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:52.433 line:82%
and never came back.

167
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.633 line:82%
That's scary.

168
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.700 line:82%
Using the accounts
of her acquaintances and eyewitnesses,

169
00:08:56.767 --> 00:09:01.300 line:82%
the police made 60,000 copies
of Ms. Kim's facial composite

170
00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:04.100 line:82%
and distributed them
around the Woosang Apartment complex.

171
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.300 line:82%
We await any information
that can help us find Ms. Kim.

172
00:09:08.367 --> 00:09:11.433 line:82%
We'll share Ms. Kim's characteristics now.

173
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.900 line:82%
What?

174
00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:15.100 line:82%
She stands tall at 165 centimeters

175
00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.734 line:82%
and has shoulder-length hair

176
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.567 line:82%
and a round face.

177
00:09:19.633 --> 00:09:21.100 line:82%
If you know Ms. Kim's whereabouts

178
00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:23.767 line:82%
or have seen a student
who matches the description,

179
00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:25.834 line:82%
please call the number below.

180
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.900 line:82%
Wind, please stop

181
00:09:29.967 --> 00:09:31.467 line:82%
It was an actual news story.

182
00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:36.333 line:82%
Is it our goal to find
a missing person today?

183
00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:40.533 line:82%
What do we need to do?

184
00:09:41.233 --> 00:09:43.266 line:82%
She has shoulder-length hair.

185
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.633 line:82%
-A round face.
-A round face.

186
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.166 line:82%
It's based on an actual incident.

187
00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:48.834 line:82%
-Yes.
-That's the inspiration for today's case.

188
00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:57.400 line:82%
The girl who disappeared
on the 30th of last month

189
00:09:57.467 --> 00:09:59.767 line:82%
went missing ten days ago.

190
00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:03.734 line:82%
I declare war on crimes and violence.

191
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.734 line:82%
She stands tall at 165 centimeters
and has shoulder-length hair…

192
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.100 line:82%
The police will crack down
on organized violence,

193
00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:12.100 line:82%
human trafficking, and drugs

194
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:14.033 line:82%
to create an anxiety-free society.

195
00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:25.166 line:82%
-Today, we need to find Ms. Kim.
-Ms. Kim.

196
00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:26.633 line:82%
There must be a story.

197
00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.667 line:82%
Come on! What's wrong with you?

198
00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:35.900 line:82%
You startled me.

199
00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:37.567 line:82%
Don't do that in broad daylight.

200
00:10:37.633 --> 00:10:38.834 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

201
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.700 line:82%
Horror stories and ghosts
scare me the most.

202
00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:45.200 line:82%
-Everyone here is a scaredy-cat.
-JENNIE, weren't you scared?

203
00:10:45.266 --> 00:10:47.400 line:82%
-She jumped like this.
-You jumped.

204
00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:49.066 line:82%
-Is it Woo-il?
-For goodness' sake.

205
00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.166 line:82%
I think it's him.

206
00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.133 line:82%
-That startled me.
-Seriously.

207
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.767 line:82%
For goodness' sake.
Don't pound on the door like that.

208
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.867 line:82%
-I'm so…
-You cried back then.

209
00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.166 line:82%
-I'm so… I'm so scared.
-You cried back then.

210
00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:12.233 line:82%
-Why?
-Why?

211
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.767 line:82%
-No one's out there.
-What?

212
00:11:13.834 --> 00:11:14.900 line:82%
No one's out there.

213
00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:16.633 line:82%
-Don't lie.
-No one's out there!

214
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.333 line:82%
-You're lying.
-Why?

215
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.500 line:82%
-No one's out there.
-JENNIE.

216
00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:21.200 line:82%
-Here I come!
-JENNIE.

217
00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:23.500 line:82%
-Here I come!
-JENNIE.

218
00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:25.333 line:82%
JENNIE might come back crying.

219
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.000 line:82%
-What's going on?
-Are we supposed to go out?

220
00:11:29.066 --> 00:11:30.500 line:82%
No one's out here.

221
00:11:30.567 --> 00:11:32.533 line:82%
There must be something to the story.

222
00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:35.133 line:82%
After pounding--

223
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.333 line:82%
-JENNIE, you're brave.
-What?

224
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.066 line:82%
-Because it's daytime.
-Daytime.

225
00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:43.233 line:82%
Since the sun is up,
I can be a bit braver.

226
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.233 line:82%
I was so surprised.

227
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.133 line:82%
Who pounded on the door?

228
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.033 line:82%
-Seriously.
-I know. They pounded hard.

229
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.200 line:82%
-Catch him!
-My goodness.

230
00:11:50.767 --> 00:11:53.200 line:82%
-Catch him!
-My goodness.

231
00:11:53.266 --> 00:11:56.333 line:82%
-Catch him!
-My goodness.

232
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.333 line:82%
That startled me.

233
00:12:01.934 --> 00:12:03.600 line:82%
Catch that man!

234
00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:14.333 line:82%
-It's a thief.
-My goodness.

235
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.633 line:82%
Stop right there!

236
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.767 line:82%
It's a thief. Hey!

237
00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:19.533 line:82%
-Out of the way!
-No!

238
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.567 line:82%
Move out of the way.

239
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.967 line:82%
Move out of the way.

240
00:12:25.066 --> 00:12:27.166 line:82%
-Move out of the way.
-Move out of the way.

241
00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:28.834 line:82%
-I'm scared.
-What?

242
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.633 line:82%
You should've caught him.

243
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.967 line:82%
I'm scared.

244
00:12:33.233 --> 00:12:34.533 line:82%
It's dangerous.

245
00:12:35.533 --> 00:12:36.834 line:82%
It's dangerous.

246
00:12:37.433 --> 00:12:39.033 line:82%
Mister!

247
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.900 line:82%
What the…

248
00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:44.834 line:82%
Mister!

249
00:12:46.734 --> 00:12:47.900 line:82%
What are you doing? Jump!

250
00:12:58.734 --> 00:13:00.633 line:82%
-Gosh.
-What's going on?

251
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.800 line:82%
This is a real situation.

252
00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:04.300 line:82%
Detective Kim.

253
00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:07.100 line:82%
Oh, he's a detective.

254
00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:08.633 line:82%
He's a detective.

255
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.834 line:82%
They really jumped from here.

256
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.600 line:82%
-I was so startled.
-Seriously.

257
00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.567 line:82%
-I mean…
-Look.

258
00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:25.633 line:82%
-I was so startled.
-Seriously.

259
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.500 line:82%
-He filmed it.
-Why did they go that far?

260
00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:29.066 line:82%
Why did you go that far?

261
00:13:29.133 --> 00:13:30.133 line:82%
That was too realistic.

262
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.867 line:82%
-What are you trying to do?
-What's wrong with you?

263
00:13:32.934 --> 00:13:35.367 line:82%
You know, we did one thing right.

264
00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:38.200 line:82%
It would've been bad
if we caught the team in the back.

265
00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:39.667 line:82%
We could've caught the police.

266
00:13:39.734 --> 00:13:41.867 line:82%
We almost caught the police just now.

267
00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:44.266 line:82%
Na-ra told me to catch them.

268
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.934 line:82%
Why didn't you men do anything?

269
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.033 line:82%
-I was scared.
-For goodness' sake.

270
00:13:49.467 --> 00:13:50.433 line:82%
It's a thief. Hey!

271
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.533 line:82%
-Out of the way!
-No!

272
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.734 line:82%
Hey!

273
00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.900 line:82%
-Move out of the way.
-Move out of the way.

274
00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:02.967 line:82%
There's a notebook here.

275
00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:04.400 line:82%
Did they drop it on purpose?

276
00:14:12.433 --> 00:14:14.166 line:82%
What's going on?

277
00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:16.166 line:82%
What's that notebook you picked up?

278
00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:18.700 line:82%
Let's see it.

279

-This is…
-"Hazard pay"?

282
00:14:24.066 --> 00:14:25.300 line:82%
"K, one person."

283
00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:27.934 line:82%
-"Three hundred thousand won"?
-What?

284
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000 line:82%
-What's this? "Arrested"?
-Arrested.

285

286
00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:34.367 line:82%
-Why does it say "hazard pay"?
-"Hazard pay."

287
00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:36.066 line:82%

-Come on.
-What?

292
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.600 line:82%
Don't play dirty like that.

293
00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:48.500 line:82%
-Memorize it.
-I'm sharing information, okay?

294
00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:50.400 line:82%
-I'll forget.
-Put the phone away.

295
00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:52.333 line:82%
-What are you doing, Jung-ha?
-Take a photo.

296
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.734 line:82%
I'll forget.

297
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.100 line:82%
Tae-hyun, take a photo.

298
00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:56.633 line:82%
You know…

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.633 line:82%
What?

300
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.467 line:82%
Had it been the delinquent Se-chan
who found the notebook,

301
00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:03.467 line:82%
-he would've hidden it.
-Let's share.

302
00:15:03.533 --> 00:15:05.967 line:82%
Earlier, your hand moved
to your back pocket.

303
00:15:06.033 --> 00:15:08.667 line:82%
I thought you were at it again,
but you took it back out.

304
00:15:08.734 --> 00:15:11.066 line:82%
-I…

00:15:55.767 --> 00:15:58.567 line:82%
-Unit 104. C, one person.
-C, one person?

320
00:16:00.567 --> 00:16:02.266 line:82%
C. So there are K and C.

321
00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:04.367 line:82%
-Names.
-They're names.

322
00:16:04.867 --> 00:16:07.100 line:82%
-K, C, Y.
-K, C, Y.

323
00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.433 line:82%
K, C. They sound like…

324
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.200 line:82%
KCM?

325
00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:14.166 line:82%
Come on.

326
00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:15.600 line:82%
That can't be it.

327
00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:18.200 line:82%
-Woosang Apartment.
-Is this related to the news story?

328
00:16:18.266 --> 00:16:19.967 line:82%
-Six hundred thousand.
-The missing person.

329
00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:23.700 line:82%
-In any case, someone tried to run…
-K, C, Y.

330
00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:25.600 line:82%
…and got arrested.

331
00:16:26.533 --> 00:16:29.233 line:82%
We await any information
that can help us find Ms. Kim.

332
00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:33.467 line:82%
-You should've caught him.
-I'm scared.

333
00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.633 line:82%
This is Woosang Apartment, right?

334
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.100 line:82%
What's up with this place?

335
00:16:45.166 --> 00:16:47.000 line:82%
WOOSANG APARTMENT, UNIT 209

336
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.433 line:82%
-This is unit 209.
-This is unit 209.

337
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.600 line:82%
This is unit 209.

338
00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:54.900 line:82%
-Unit 209.
-The detectives caught him here.

339
00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:01.834 line:82%
This is it. This is the place…

340
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.367 line:82%
-Unit 209.
-…that holds a clue.

341
00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:05.500 line:82%
A man jumped out of this unit.

342
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.967 line:82%
What's the secret today?

343
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.967 line:82%
We need to find the missing girl.

344
00:17:16.033 --> 00:17:17.900 line:82%
-This is it, everyone.
-This unit is bigger.

345
00:17:17.967 --> 00:17:20.567 line:82%
-This is the crime scene.
-You're like a prosecutor.

346
00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:23.867 line:82%
This is the unit
that man ran out of, right?

347
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.467 line:82%
He ran out of this unit.

348
00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:33.200 line:82%
Last time, there were
many clues inside the apartment.

349
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.767 line:82%
These details are incredible.

350
00:17:39.734 --> 00:17:42.400 line:82%
Jae-seok, I guess
there was something worth stealing.

351
00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:45.667 line:82%
What was the culprit doing?

352
00:17:45.734 --> 00:17:47.367 line:82%
Everything is suspicious.

353
00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.433 line:82%
-Why do you think he stole something?
-What?

354
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.567 line:82%
Maybe he was visiting.

355
00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:53.567 line:82%
Why would a visitor run away like that?

356
00:17:58.266 --> 00:18:00.834 line:82%
Since there's nothing,
I'm beginning to get curious.

357
00:18:14.033 --> 00:18:16.066 line:82%
-What's this?
-That man…

358
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.400 line:82%
What is it? It seems important.

359
00:18:19.467 --> 00:18:21.533 line:82%
-There was something worth stealing.
-Hey.

360
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.433 line:82%
"Eradicating antisocial crimes."

361
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.233 line:82%
It's all in the newspaper.

362
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.133 line:82%
"Increasing penalty levels for poisoning."

363
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.600 line:82%
Thank goodness we have you.

364
00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:36.834 line:82%
It's about crimes.

365
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.100 line:82%
Look. It's the same thing.

366
00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:40.133 line:82%
"A middle schooler's suicide"? What?

367
00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:44.934 line:82%
Why is there an article
about a repeater's suicide?

368
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.834 line:82%
"A sudden drop in grades
is a dangerous sign."

369
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.500 line:82%
A SUDDEN DROP IN GRADES
IS A DANGEROUS SIGN

370
00:19:00.533 --> 00:19:01.934 line:82%
Am I…

371
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.533 line:82%
the only one who can read this newspaper?

372
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.633 line:82%
-Seriously. It's so frustrating.
-Are there Chinese characters?

373
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.834 line:82%
-Yes.
-So many of them.

374
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.000 line:82%
-Are there?
-Yes.

375
00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:14.066 line:82%
Even if they give us a newspaper,
we can't read it.

376
00:19:14.133 --> 00:19:15.400 line:82%
Hold on.

377
00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:16.900 line:82%
I'm anxious.

378
00:19:16.967 --> 00:19:17.800 line:82%
What is it?

379
00:19:17.867 --> 00:19:19.934 line:82%
"String of kidnappings
of high school girls."

380
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.633 line:82%
-Hold on. Are we going in that direction?
-Kidnappings?

381
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.633 line:82%
-Was that man a kidnapper?
-A kidnapper.

382
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.400 line:82%
I think everything is connected.

383
00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:29.633 line:82%
It's a kidnapping case.

384
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.767 line:82%
How about the man
who got arrested earlier?

385
00:19:31.834 --> 00:19:33.934 line:82%
-He attempted to kidnap girls.
-I see.

386
00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:47.166 line:82%
Hodori.

387
00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:51.233 line:82%
The room's owner must be a student too.

388
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.767 line:82%
-I think so.
-Right?

389
00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:12.533 line:82%
I figured out the student's name.

390
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.567 line:82%
What? What is it?

391
00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:18.166 line:82%
It's Kim Mi-young.

392
00:20:18.934 --> 00:20:21.033 line:82%
The student… the student on the news?

393
00:20:21.734 --> 00:20:24.567 line:82%
The police began the search
for the missing person.

394
00:20:24.633 --> 00:20:27.800 line:82%
We await any information
that can help us find Ms. Kim.

395
00:20:28.667 --> 00:20:30.300 line:82%
-See?
-Kim Mi-young.

396
00:20:30.367 --> 00:20:31.500 line:82%
He found it.

397
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.133 line:82%
-Her grades weren't bad.
-I know.

398
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.300 line:82%
-Her grades improved.
-Let me see.

399
00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:41.667 line:82%
-Let me see.
-Look.

400
00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:43.500 line:82%
They weren't good in the first semester.

401
00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:46.233 line:82%
They weren't good in the first semester.

402
00:20:48.734 --> 00:20:51.433 line:82%
-Hold on. What's this?
-I mean…

403
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.834 line:82%
Na-ra is coming.

404
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.567 line:82%
-Hold on. I'll give a briefing.
-A briefing.

405
00:20:56.633 --> 00:20:58.867 line:82%
-Jae-seok, I found it.
-This is…

406
00:20:58.934 --> 00:21:01.633 line:82%
Delinquents like Se-chan
don't share information like this.

407
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.266 line:82%
-What is it?
-Show us.

408
00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:04.600 line:82%
-Kim Mi-young.
-Kim Mi-young.

409
00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:06.433 line:82%
-Jung-ha found it.
-Yes.

410
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.433 line:82%
Jung-ha just focused on the name.

411
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.767 line:82%
But what are the details here?

412
00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:11.800 line:82%
-The grades.
-What about them?

413
00:21:11.867 --> 00:21:14.000 line:82%
-They improved.
-Yes. That's exactly right.

414
00:21:14.834 --> 00:21:17.834 line:82%
In the first semester,
her grades were just okay.

415
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.266 line:82%
-But in the second semester…
-They suddenly improved.

416
00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:23.266 line:82%
Her grades improved.

417
00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:24.500 line:82%
What does this mean?

418
00:21:24.567 --> 00:21:26.200 line:82%
Did she study harder? Did she cheat?

419
00:21:26.266 --> 00:21:27.233 line:82%
She was stressed.

420
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.767 line:82%
-Use it for deductions.
-But…

421
00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:31.533 line:82%
-What does it mean?
-I don't know.

422
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600 line:82%
That's ridiculous.

423
00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.333 line:82%
-What does it mean?
-I don't know.

424
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.500 line:82%
That's ridiculous.

425
00:21:35.567 --> 00:21:37.700 line:82%
-How am I supposed to know?
-We can say that too.

426
00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:39.233 line:82%
I thought there was more.

427
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.934 line:82%
-Perhaps Mi-young suddenly studied hard.
-We should keep this in mind.

428
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.934 line:82%
We don't know.

429
00:21:46.233 --> 00:21:47.500 line:82%
Isn't that a diary?

430
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.300 line:82%
-I'll read it.
-Hey.

431
00:21:56.367 --> 00:21:57.500 line:82%
JENNIE, read it.

432
00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.433 line:82%
"Today, I'm feeling rad."

433
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.667 line:82%
Right. We used to say "rad."

434
00:22:00.734 --> 00:22:03.900 line:82%
-"My midterm grades went up a lot."
-They went up.

435
00:22:03.967 --> 00:22:05.100 line:82%
"Because of that,

436
00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:07.567 line:82%
my friends asked me
about my studying methods.

437
00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:10.500 line:82%
The whole time I was studying,
I wondered if I was going too far.

438
00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:12.700 line:82%
But the good results
took a weight off my shoulders.

439
00:22:12.767 --> 00:22:15.266 line:82%
For the first time ever,
my mom smiled when she saw my grades.

440
00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:17.200 line:82%
I should keep this up."

441
00:22:17.266 --> 00:22:19.533 line:82%
What? There's a star.

442
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.367 line:82%
-What is it?
-You have to read that.

443
00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:24.233 line:82%
"Soon, I'll need to listen
to Lee Moon-sae again.

444
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.000 line:82%
I'm tired of Lee Moon-sae now."

445
00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:27.533 line:82%
-Lee Moon-sae?
-
A Starry Night
.

446
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.867 line:82%
-I liked Lee Moon-sae too.
-
A Starry Night
.

447
00:22:29.934 --> 00:22:33.200 line:82%
-Lee Moon-sae.
-"Lullaby…"

448
00:22:33.266 --> 00:22:35.834 line:82%
-There's more.
-Read it.

449
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.266 line:82%
"I've listened to Lee Moon-sae
every night for two weeks.

450
00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:39.900 line:82%
My ears have had enough."

451
00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:42.834 line:82%
-She likes Lee Moon-sae.
-"I want to watch
Love and Ambition
."

452
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.767 line:82%
No, look. "Soon, I'll need to listen
to Lee Moon-sae again."

453
00:22:45.834 --> 00:22:48.867 line:82%
-Does she not like him? I guess not.
-"I'm tired of Lee Moon-sae now."

454
00:22:51.467 --> 00:22:52.967 line:82%
-There it is.
-Let's play it.

455
00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:54.367 line:82%
Look at those.

456
00:22:54.433 --> 00:22:55.433 line:82%
LEE MOON-SAE

457
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.033 line:82%
-Lee Moon-sae.
-Yes.

458
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.100 line:82%
Bring it over here.

459
00:22:58.166 --> 00:23:01.000 line:82%
You remember everything. I don't remember.

460
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.333 line:82%
It's Moon-sae's song.

461
00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:08.166 line:82%
-Moon-sae's songs are nice.
-
By my side

462
00:23:08.734 --> 00:23:10.633 line:82%
-
Don't leave
-
Don't leave

463
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.233 line:82%
It's an equalizer.

464
00:23:13.834 --> 00:23:15.000 line:82%
Really?

465
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.200 line:82%
It's an equalizer.

466
00:23:18.934 --> 00:23:20.300 line:82%
Really?

467
00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:21.934 line:82%
What? I didn't know about this.

468
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.734 line:82%
We'll learn a few idioms.

469
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.367 line:82%
Al Capone, who ruled the US underworld
for five years…

470
00:23:28.433 --> 00:23:31.133 line:82%
-What is she saying?
-
…was eventually charged with tax evasion,

471
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.800 line:82%
-
sentenced to 11 years…
-It's a lecture.

472
00:23:32.867 --> 00:23:35.633 line:82%
-You understand, right?
-
…and an 80,000 dollar fine.

473
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.533 line:82%
Why is this coming
from Lee Moon-sae's tape?

474
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.533 line:82%
"Charged with."

475
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.734 line:82%
-
"Capone was charged with tax evasion."
-The content is unrelated.

476
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.166 line:82%
That's the sentence.

477
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.500 line:82%
Is that the end?

478
00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:49.734 line:82%
It was a lecture.

479
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.467 line:82%
Lee Moon-sae's song played at first.

480
00:23:51.533 --> 00:23:53.467 line:82%
-She recorded it on this tape.
-Is that it?

481
00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:56.000 line:82%
That's the end of the tape.

482
00:23:56.066 --> 00:23:58.567 line:82%
We'll learn a few idioms.

483
00:23:58.633 --> 00:24:01.367 line:82%
Al Capone, who ruled the US underworld…

484
00:24:01.433 --> 00:24:03.767 line:82%
"A sudden drop in grades
is a dangerous sign."

485
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:09.333 line:82%
It seems like Mi-young
was under academic stress.

486
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.133 line:82%
-She didn't like it.
-Listen to this.

487
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.834 line:82%
"In 30 minutes, I'm going to prison."

488
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.734 line:82%
What?

489
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.000 line:82%
"It only exists in this apartment.

490
00:24:19.066 --> 00:24:21.000 line:82%
Every night, I go to prison."

491
00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:25.100 line:82%
Hold on. She goes to prison?
What does she mean by that?

492
00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:26.567 line:82%
-A study room?
-A reading room?

493
00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:28.633 line:82%
That must be it. A reading room
can feel like prison.

494
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.300 line:82%
That's what we called it too.

495
00:24:31.066 --> 00:24:35.266 line:82%
They dedicate every waking moment
to studying for the college entrance exam.

496
00:24:39.934 --> 00:24:40.967 line:82%
Salute the teacher.

497
00:24:41.033 --> 00:24:43.066 line:82%
-Sir!
-Sir!

498
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.000 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

499
00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.066 line:82%
12 A.M., INSPECTION

500
00:24:46.133 --> 00:24:47.467 line:82%
Class Four, at ease.

501
00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:48.867 line:82%
-At ease.
-At ease.

502
00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:51.467 line:82%
Like the dolls that close their eyes
when in a lying position,

503
00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:54.300 line:82%
they fall asleep as soon as they lie down.

504
00:24:55.467 --> 00:24:57.333 line:82%
Did you refer to academies as prisons?

505
00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.266 line:82%
-Yes. We didn't want to go.
-Really?

506
00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:00.633 line:82%
Yes.

507
00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:05.367 line:82%
In any case, Kim Mi-young

508
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.433 line:82%
was under a lot of stress for some reason.

509
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.100 line:82%
But her grades went up a lot.

510
00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:11.934 line:82%
What? The phone is ringing.

511
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.900 line:82%
They won't let us rest for even a second.

512
00:25:15.033 --> 00:25:16.433 line:82%
The phone is ringing.

513
00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:20.367 line:82%
-Hello?
-Why is Jae-seok doing everything?

514
00:25:20.433 --> 00:25:21.467 line:82%
Hold on. Okay.

515
00:25:21.533 --> 00:25:22.633 line:82%
Hold on.

516
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.000 line:82%
-Hello?
-Let's listen as well.

517
00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:25.834 line:82%
Hello? Hold on. Hello?

518
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.700 line:82%
Hello?

519
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.000 line:82%
-Wait.
-What was that? Why did you hang up?

520
00:25:31.066 --> 00:25:33.900 line:82%
-Why did you hang up after listening?
-Come here.

521
00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:35.700 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-Unbelievable.

522
00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:37.166 line:82%
You hung up after "Hello."

523
00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:38.500 line:82%
Mi-young… It's ringing.

524
00:25:38.567 --> 00:25:41.066 line:82%
-Put it on speaker.
-Speaker.

525
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.867 line:82%
Hello?

526
00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:45.467 line:82%
Hello, residents.

527
00:25:45.533 --> 00:25:48.600 line:82%
Don't share this phone conversation
with anyone else.

528
00:25:48.667 --> 00:25:51.900 line:82%
Listen by yourself.

529
00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.400 line:82%
-Hello?
-Hold on.

530
00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:55.967 line:82%
Hello?

531
00:25:56.033 --> 00:25:57.233 line:82%
Jae-seok.

532
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.967 line:82%
Only one person can take this call.

533
00:25:59.033 --> 00:26:00.934 line:82%
-Why are you so obsessed…
-Everyone, come here.

534
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.934 line:82%
-…with the phone?
-Come. Gosh, Jae-seok.

535
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.266 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-He got to it so fast.

536
00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:05.333 line:82%
Go into the room.

537
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.233 line:82%
Will he become a spy?

538
00:26:07.867 --> 00:26:09.800 line:82%
-Go into the room.
-He picked it up

539
00:26:09.867 --> 00:26:11.400 line:82%
-in such a hurry.
-It won't take long.

540
00:26:11.467 --> 00:26:13.333 line:82%
Jae-seok changed upon hearing the rules.

541
00:26:14.734 --> 00:26:16.467 line:82%
Go on in. Go into the room.

542
00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:18.200 line:82%
-I'll close the door.
-Close the door.

543
00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:19.333 line:82%
What could it be?

544
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.400 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-Listen.

545
00:26:20.467 --> 00:26:23.100 line:82%
-Last week, we got a piece of paper.
-Yes.

546
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:25.734 line:82%
-I guess that's the method today.
-It keeps us suspicious.

547
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.900 line:82%
Seriously.

548
00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:30.800 line:82%
I'm alone right now.

549
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.967 line:82%
Go on.

550
00:26:35.033 --> 00:26:37.834 line:82%
The atmosphere is chaotic
at the apartment these days.

551
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.900 line:82%
Someone at the apartment has gone missing.

552
00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:42.467 line:82%
Residents…

553
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.233 line:82%
Okay. Go on.

554
00:26:48.533 --> 00:26:49.533 line:82%
Okay.

555
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.333 line:82%
That was nothing important.

556
00:26:54.567 --> 00:26:56.033 line:82%
Seriously, Jae-seok!

557
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.367 line:82%
You startled me.

558
00:26:57.433 --> 00:26:58.667 line:82%
My shoulder hurts.

559
00:26:58.734 --> 00:27:00.233 line:82%
I almost got a cramp.

560
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.233 line:82%
-Who wants to go next? I'll go.
-Go ahead.

561
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.700 line:82%
Were you told not to share it?

562
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.300 line:82%
It isn't something
that should be a secret.

563
00:27:08.367 --> 00:27:10.667 line:82%
-But your voice became louder.
-No.

564
00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:14.367 line:82%
He just said that many people went missing
at the apartment,

565
00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:15.900 line:82%
and I should be careful.

566
00:27:18.066 --> 00:27:21.800 line:82%
It was nothing special. I don't know
why they made it seem suspicious.

567
00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:23.767 line:82%
-Maybe it doesn't exist.
-But…

568
00:27:23.834 --> 00:27:26.100 line:82%
Jae-seok, why can't we share it?

569
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.300 line:82%
It's nothing.
We could've heard it together.

570
00:27:28.367 --> 00:27:29.667 line:82%
I mean…

571
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.700 line:82%
Hello. Who are you?

572
00:27:39.233 --> 00:27:40.233 line:82%
Okay.

573
00:27:44.633 --> 00:27:45.767 line:82%
Hello?

574
00:27:46.467 --> 00:27:47.467 line:82%
Okay.

575
00:27:47.533 --> 00:27:48.500 line:82%
You're…

576
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.867 line:82%
…today.

577
00:28:00.867 --> 00:28:05.133 line:82%
If you don't drink
four bottles of orange juice by 2 p.m.,

578
00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:09.333 line:82%
your identity will be revealed.

579
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.533 line:82%
…your identity will be revealed.

580
00:28:13.633 --> 00:28:14.934 line:82%
Is that it?

581
00:28:15.567 --> 00:28:16.967 line:82%
Understood.

582
00:28:39.867 --> 00:28:41.300 line:82%
What are you doing?

583
00:28:48.967 --> 00:28:51.000 line:82%
This is an announcement.

584
00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:54.467 line:82%
For a clue regarding
the apartment's secret,

585
00:28:54.533 --> 00:28:57.934 line:82%
the resident gathering will begin.

586
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.333 line:82%
To unit 207.

587
00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:04.900 line:82%
-Okay. Don't touch anything.
-Okay.

588
00:29:04.967 --> 00:29:07.300 line:82%
I'll explain the rules…

589
00:29:07.367 --> 00:29:09.300 line:82%
-Go on.
-…of the game.

590
00:29:09.367 --> 00:29:11.867 line:82%
-Last week, the game was quite complex.
-Yes.

591
00:29:11.934 --> 00:29:13.967 line:82%
-I'm sure it was confusing.
-Yes.

592
00:29:14.033 --> 00:29:16.266 line:82%
You were the most confused.

593
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.734 line:82%
Yes.

594
00:29:18.834 --> 00:29:19.734 line:82%
-Thus…
-Okay.

595
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.266 line:82%
-…I prepared a simple game.
-That's good.

596
00:29:24.433 --> 00:29:28.233 line:82%
Escape the Goblin Apartment.

597
00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:31.233 line:82%
-
There will be an offense and a defense.
-
Okay.

598
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.200 line:82%
An offense and a defense.

599
00:29:33.266 --> 00:29:37.033 line:82%
-
Pick the leader of the offense.
-
Okay.

600
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.700 line:82%
You need to carry out the mission
on the mission note,

601
00:29:39.767 --> 00:29:42.200 line:82%
but it won't be a simple task.

602
00:29:42.266 --> 00:29:44.433 line:82%
A bell will be attached to your ankle.

603
00:29:45.934 --> 00:29:49.066 line:82%
Someone is here. Hey!

604
00:29:49.133 --> 00:29:50.433 line:82%
Hey!

605
00:29:52.467 --> 00:29:55.767 line:82%
You will get 100 points if you
succeed in carrying out the mission.

606
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.700 line:82%
Every time a member of the defense
hits the leader with a goblin bat,

607
00:29:59.767 --> 00:30:01.967 line:82%
ten points will be deducted.

608
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.867 line:82%
-Hey, come on.
-What's this?

609
00:30:05.934 --> 00:30:07.266 line:82%
Isn't someone here?

610
00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:10.133 line:82%
Isn't someone here? Who's this?

611
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.633 line:82%
-Jae-seok, I think we failed.
-Hey.

612
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.133 line:82%
Come on out. You failed.

613
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.033 line:82%
-Where is he?
-Come on out.

614
00:30:17.834 --> 00:30:19.133 line:82%
My goodness.

615
00:30:23.967 --> 00:30:26.233 line:82%
The team with the higher total will win.

616
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.133 line:82%
-Good.
-All right.

617
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.367 line:82%
-So cute. Look at the bats.
-So cute.

618
00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:30.967 line:82%
They're the goblin bats.

619
00:30:31.734 --> 00:30:33.967 line:82%
-Shall we play defense?
-Okay.

620
00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:35.467 line:82%
Let's wear the blindfolds.

621
00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:37.400 line:82%
JENNIE, your face is so small.

622
00:30:37.467 --> 00:30:41.667 line:82%
The blindfold covers
two-thirds of your face, JENNIE.

623
00:30:41.734 --> 00:30:43.433 line:82%
It covers all of her face.

624
00:30:45.867 --> 00:30:47.133 line:82%
I want to get hit.

625
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:54.033 line:82%
-Woo-il, don't hit JENNIE.
-It wasn't me.

626
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.467 line:82%
-Mr. Security Guard.
-It wasn't me.

627
00:30:56.533 --> 00:30:58.500 line:82%
-Mr. Security Guard.
-It wasn't me.

628
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.266 line:82%
Woo-il.

629
00:31:03.233 --> 00:31:04.367 line:82%
Woo-il.

630
00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:06.867 line:82%

I hear it coming from the master bedroom.

806
00:39:31.934 --> 00:39:32.834 line:82%
My bat!

835
00:41:14.633 --> 00:41:17.066 line:82%
Tae-hyun, I got him.

836
00:41:17.133 --> 00:41:20.066 line:82%
What do we have here?

837
00:41:20.133 --> 00:41:21.300 line:82%
What do we have here?

838
00:41:22.767 --> 00:41:25.533 line:82%
She's moving around. Hey, you!

839
00:41:27.667 --> 00:41:28.834 line:82%
Where are you?

-Na-ra, it's me.
-The producer.

844
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.467 line:82%
Gosh, you bad producer!

845
00:41:41.533 --> 00:41:44.266 line:82%
Bad producer! For goodness' sake.

846
00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:45.467 line:82%
What?

847
00:41:45.533 --> 00:41:48.433 line:82%
She ran away.

848
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.467 line:82%
Where did my bat go?

849
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.633 line:82%
Why do I only hear one bell?

850
00:41:55.834 --> 00:41:58.200 line:82%
I hear the bell. She's here.

851
00:41:58.266 --> 00:41:59.100 line:82%
She's here.

852

859
00:42:30.266 --> 00:42:33.033 line:82%
-Chewing?
-Tae-hyun, hold on.

860
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.367 line:82%

-Where?

861
00:42:35.433 --> 00:42:37.600 line:82%
-I'm done.
-He's mine.

862
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.100 line:82%
Jae-seok is eating rice
with dried seaweed.

863
00:42:42.166 --> 00:42:43.633 line:82%
Take the dried seaweed.

864
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.700 line:82%

871
00:42:57.367 --> 00:42:59.133 line:82%
-Na-ra is beating me.
-I said Jae-seok was mine.

872
00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.433 line:82%
Who's this?

873
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.900 line:82%
-You little…
-Oh Na-ra is hitting me.

874
00:43:02.967 --> 00:43:04.133 line:82%
Five.

875
00:43:08.834 --> 00:43:10.967 line:82%
Tae-hyun, JENNIE was here.

876
00:43:11.033 --> 00:43:11.967 line:82%
Who's this? Jae-seok?

877
00:43:12.033 --> 00:43:13.700 line:82%
-My bat.
-Oh, no.

878
00:43:13.767 --> 00:43:16.600 line:82%
My bat. What?

879
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:19.600 line:82%
My bat. What?

880
00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:20.767 line:82%
I'm here. Come here.

881
00:43:20.834 --> 00:43:23.800 line:82%
-Where is he?
-I dropped my bat.

882
00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:26.433 line:82%
-I dropped my bat.

883
00:43:27.066 --> 00:43:30.767 line:82%

885
00:43:32.934 --> 00:43:34.767 line:82%
-Hey, Jae-seok.
-My bat.

886
00:43:34.834 --> 00:43:36.734 line:82%
-Who's this?
-It was Jae-seok, wasn't it?

887
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.100 line:82%
-Hey.
-Jae-seok stole our bats.

888
00:43:39.834 --> 00:43:42.166 line:82%
-Give me back my bat.
-Jae-seok.

889
00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:43.233 line:82%
This isn't it.

890
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.533 line:82%
This is a mess.

891
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.633 line:82%
-Give me back my bat.
-Jae-seok.

892
00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:48.367 line:82%

00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:57.567 line:82%
-My bat.
-Who is it?

897
00:43:57.633 --> 00:43:59.567 line:82%
Someone is hitting me.

898
00:43:59.633 --> 00:44:02.767 line:82%
Gosh, someone is hitting me.

899
00:44:02.834 --> 00:44:04.066 line:82%
I'll hit you with my hands then.

900
00:44:04.133 --> 00:44:05.700 line:82%
Can't I use my hands?

901
00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:07.200 line:82%
Give me back my bat.

902
00:44:07.266 --> 00:44:09.333 line:82%
Give me back my bat.

903
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.834 line:82%
-Give me back my bat.
-Jae-seok.

904
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.433 line:82%
Where's my bat?

905
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.500 line:82%
I mean…

906
00:44:15.266 --> 00:44:16.633 line:82%
Where's my bat?

907
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.867 line:82%
So that's how you play the game.

908
00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:20.200 line:82%
See? JENNIE, you're good.

909
00:44:20.266 --> 00:44:21.967 line:82%
-You're good.
-My goodness.

910
00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:24.867 line:82%
-Where's my bat?
-How could you steal our bats?

911
00:44:25.467 --> 00:44:27.900 line:82%
So it's fine to steal the bat? Okay.

912
00:44:27.967 --> 00:44:30.166 line:82%
-The game is over.
-It's over?

913
00:44:30.233 --> 00:44:33.934 line:82%
-I was going to steal their bats.
-Someone stepped on me like this.

914
00:44:35.633 --> 00:44:38.367 line:82%
Yu Jae-seok's team won. The Yus.

915
00:44:38.433 --> 00:44:39.800 line:82%
Yes!

916
00:44:39.867 --> 00:44:40.900 line:82%
Okay.

917
00:44:40.967 --> 00:44:44.066 line:82%
Since the Yus won,

918
00:44:44.133 --> 00:44:46.700 line:82%
they can call Woosang Chinese Restaurant

919
00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:50.633 line:82%
and order the dishes of their choice.

920
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.667 line:82%
The Yus are the best.

921
00:44:53.767 --> 00:44:54.834 line:82%
I want some too.

922
00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:07.467 line:82%
I'm exhausted.

923
00:45:08.533 --> 00:45:11.033 line:82%
-Let's switch.
-Let's switch.

924
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.000 line:82%
Let's get food delivered.
What do you want?

925
00:45:22.066 --> 00:45:23.533 line:82%
-Jjajangmyeon.
-Same here.

926
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.533 line:82%
-Regular?

927
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.734 line:82%
-Jjajangmyeon, jjamppong…
-Yes.

928
00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.867 line:82%
Yes.

929
00:45:29.867 --> 00:45:31.533 line:82%
Come here. I'll cook ramyeon.

930
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.834 line:82%
-Hey.
-Yes?

931
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.734 line:82%
Share what you know with me.

932
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.500 line:82%
-What?
-I just spotted something strange.

933
00:45:39.567 --> 00:45:41.433 line:82%
What?

934
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.834 line:82%
-It's about Na-ra.
-About Na-ra?

935
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.500 line:82%
JENNIE saw it too.

936
00:45:45.567 --> 00:45:46.734 line:82%
What did she see?

937
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.200 line:82%
The two of us burst out laughing.

938
00:45:50.667 --> 00:45:51.600 line:82%
What is it?

939
00:45:51.667 --> 00:45:54.533 line:82%
What should I eat? Should I eat jjamppong?

940
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.266 line:82%
Jung-ha, I'll have…

941
00:46:02.133 --> 00:46:04.433 line:82%
Jung-ha, I'll have jjamppong.

942
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.066 line:82%
And two bowls of jjajangmyeon,
one plate of fried dumplings…

943
00:46:08.133 --> 00:46:09.500 line:82%
and one sweet and sour pork.

944
00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.266 line:82%
Okay.

945
00:46:14.333 --> 00:46:16.900 line:82%
She downed the entire bottle
while we were watching.

946
00:46:16.967 --> 00:46:19.333 line:82%
She downed the entire bottle?

947
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.934 line:82%
JENNIE and I found it so funny.

948
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

949
00:46:23.066 --> 00:46:29.500 line:82%
Hold on. Before Na-ra left,
she downed this bottle.

950
00:46:29.567 --> 00:46:31.433 line:82%
-Go on.
-It's a bit suspicious.

951
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.567 line:82%
You're sharp.

952
00:46:32.633 --> 00:46:34.667 line:82%
Yes. She suddenly chugged it.

953
00:46:34.734 --> 00:46:36.467 line:82%
Maybe she was thirsty.

954
00:46:36.533 --> 00:46:40.834 line:82%
-But--
-It obviously looks like a mission item.

955
00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.000 line:82%
And earlier,

956
00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:44.934 line:82%
-the producer told us not to drink them.
-He said that.

957
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.433 line:82%
You can drink them,
but the bottles are a bit dirty.

958
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.533 line:82%
-The look in your eyes…
-Why are you…

959
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.533 line:82%
-The look in your eyes…
-Why are you…

960
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.767 line:82%
-Why are you covering for her?
-Hold on.

961
00:46:54.834 --> 00:46:56.900 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Why are you covering for her?

962
00:46:56.967 --> 00:46:58.300 line:82%
Goodness, these two…

963
00:46:58.367 --> 00:47:00.400 line:82%
How did they change so much in a week?

964
00:47:00.467 --> 00:47:01.700 line:82%
-You're sharp.
-Right?

965
00:47:01.767 --> 00:47:02.767 line:82%
-I had no idea.
-Hey.

966
00:47:02.834 --> 00:47:06.200 line:82%
I've known you for a while,
but that look in your eyes is new.

967
00:47:06.266 --> 00:47:07.500 line:82%
I've changed.

968
00:47:07.567 --> 00:47:08.967 line:82%
-Is that so?
-Yes.

969
00:47:09.033 --> 00:47:11.333 line:82%
-Are you carrying out a mission?
-No.

970
00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:14.033 line:82%
-I don't believe you guys.
-Oran-C.

971
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.500 line:82%
Let's have a drink.

972
00:47:15.567 --> 00:47:17.233 line:82%
Is there any ice?

973
00:47:19.734 --> 00:47:21.700 line:82%
I guess it doesn't have that function.

974
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.000 line:82%
Before Na-ra left,
she downed this bottle.

975
00:47:25.066 --> 00:47:26.367 line:82%
It's a bit suspicious.

976
00:47:27.667 --> 00:47:29.900 line:82%
-Why are you…
-Why are you covering for her?

977
00:47:43.233 --> 00:47:44.767 line:82%
Wait, she's back.

978
00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:52.000 line:82%
They need to give us ramyeon to cook.

979
00:47:52.066 --> 00:47:53.900 line:82%
-What did you two talk about?
-What?

980
00:47:53.967 --> 00:47:55.767 line:82%
-What did you two talk about?
-We shared information.

981
00:47:55.834 --> 00:47:58.133 line:82%
Tell me honestly.

982
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.000 line:82%
Na-ra, be honest. You're full, right?

983
00:48:01.066 --> 00:48:02.400 line:82%
I'm full.

984
00:48:02.467 --> 00:48:05.700 line:82%
I'm full. Why? Why do you ask?

985
00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:07.066 line:82%
-Why?
-Tae-hyun.

986
00:48:07.133 --> 00:48:10.600 line:82%
Just wait for three more hours.
We promised to play dumb, remember?

987
00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:11.967 line:82%
I'm full. Why?

988
00:48:12.033 --> 00:48:14.000 line:82%
-Is there something going on?
-No, not at all.

989
00:48:14.667 --> 00:48:17.567 line:82%
Na-ra, when you feel hot
after working out,

990
00:48:17.633 --> 00:48:19.333 line:82%
do you normally down a beverage?

991
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.300 line:82%
-Don't you?
-I don't down it.

992
00:48:21.367 --> 00:48:23.700 line:82%
Well, I do.

993
00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:26.233 line:82%
Why? Are you suspecting me?

994
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.600 line:82%
-Okay, Na-ra.
-Come on.

995
00:48:27.667 --> 00:48:30.266 line:82%
-Come on. Let's feign ignorance.
-Seriously, I'm not a spy.

996
00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:31.500 line:82%
Let's feign ignorance.

997
00:48:31.567 --> 00:48:32.667 line:82%
-All right.
-Okay.

998
00:48:33.467 --> 00:48:36.433 line:82%
What are you guys doing
at Kim Mi-young's place?

999
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.633 line:82%
It's our place now.

1000
00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.533 line:82%
-Na-ra, why did you down the orange juice?
-What?

1001
00:48:43.633 --> 00:48:45.066 line:82%
Why do you keep drinking beverages?

1002
00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:46.467 line:82%
I'm hot. Aren't you hot?

1003
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.500 line:82%
-What's going on?
-There must be a parasite in her body.

1004
00:48:51.567 --> 00:48:54.867 line:82%
Everyone is filming
Deranged
.

1005
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.533 line:82%
Did she receive a mission?

1006
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.033 line:82%
But she did it openly.

1007
00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.066 line:82%
She did the mission openly.

1008
00:49:07.133 --> 00:49:08.100 line:82%
Come here.

1009
00:49:08.166 --> 00:49:10.400 line:82%
What? Where did Jung-ha go?

1010
00:49:10.467 --> 00:49:12.600 line:82%
-Was something there?
-Jung-ha disappeared.

1011
00:49:12.667 --> 00:49:14.567 line:82%
Was something there?

1012
00:49:16.967 --> 00:49:18.333 line:82%
Come on.

1013
00:49:20.734 --> 00:49:23.433 line:82%
Huh? Where did Jung-ha go?

1014
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.367 line:82%
Huh? Where did Jung-ha go?

1015
00:49:27.333 --> 00:49:29.033 line:82%
-Why are you suddenly…
-What?

1016
00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.767 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-Washing my hands.

1017
00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:32.700 line:82%
I'm innocent.

1018
00:49:32.767 --> 00:49:34.033 line:82%
I'm really innocent.

1019
00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.934 line:82%
What were you doing here alone?

1020
00:49:36.633 --> 00:49:38.867 line:82%
-Are we really on the same team?
-Of course.

1021
00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:40.500 line:82%
They need to give us a hint.

1022
00:49:40.567 --> 00:49:42.400 line:82%
-Did you see it?
-No. We haven't gotten it.

1023
00:49:42.467 --> 00:49:44.800 line:82%
-Did you see the other team's clue?
-No.

1024
00:49:44.867 --> 00:49:46.567 line:82%
-There was a clue?
-Yes, I saw it.

1025
00:49:46.633 --> 00:49:48.033 line:82%
-What did you see?
-What is it?

1026
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.233 line:82%
"Look at the books and newspaper
in unit 207."

1027
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.400 line:82%
Your lunch is here.

1028
00:49:53.467 --> 00:49:55.166 line:82%
Cook this for lunch.

1029
00:49:55.233 --> 00:49:57.767 line:82%
LOOK AT THE BOOKS AND NEWSPAPER
IN UNIT 207

1030
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:04.667 line:82%
-Books and a newspaper?
-I see.

1031
00:50:04.734 --> 00:50:06.500 line:82%
Books and a newspaper.

1032
00:50:21.433 --> 00:50:23.467 line:82%
Jae-seok, I shared what I saw.

1033
00:50:23.533 --> 00:50:24.934 line:82%
We're a team.

1034
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.433 line:82%
-Your delivery is here.
-Okay. That was fast.

1035
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.100 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1036
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.033 line:82%
-Jae-seok, the hint is here.
-Really?

1037
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.266 line:82%
Thank you.

1038
00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:52.867 line:82%
-May I take it?
-Yes.

1039
00:50:52.934 --> 00:50:54.033 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1040
00:51:03.567 --> 00:51:04.867 line:82%
Shall we hurry up and watch it?

1041
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.233 line:82%
All right. It's playing.

1042
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.300 line:82%
Let's watch it.

1043
00:51:12.266 --> 00:51:14.166 line:82%
THE 1293RD EPISODE

1044
00:51:14.233 --> 00:51:16.567 line:82%
The younger generations…

1045
00:51:17.834 --> 00:51:22.333 line:82%
should no longer be tormented by…

1046
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.333 line:82%
All forms of… should be prohibited.

1047
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.633 line:82%
-What is it?
-I figured it out.

1048
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:29.800 line:82%
Apartment noise.

1049
00:51:29.867 --> 00:51:31.600 line:82%
No.

1050
00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:33.934 line:82%
The Social Purification Committee
had been in charge of…

1051
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.567 line:82%
REPORT THE CRIME
OF PRIVATE LESSONS

1052
00:51:35.633 --> 00:51:38.567 line:82%
…but the police and prosecution
have taken over.

1053
00:51:38.633 --> 00:51:41.900 line:82%
According to the Social Purification
Committee, from July of 1980 to now,

1054
00:51:41.967 --> 00:51:44.166 line:82%
a total of 2,375 people were arrested for…

1055
00:51:44.233 --> 00:51:46.200 line:82%
…during the crackdown.

1056
00:51:46.266 --> 00:51:48.633 line:82%
Forty-four people were charged criminally,

1057
00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.433 line:82%
twenty-six people were dismissed,

1058
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.900 line:82%
and 40 people underwent
a tax investigation.

1059
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.100 line:82%
-I figured it out.
-Really?

1060
00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:58.066 line:82%
What is it?

1061
00:51:58.133 --> 00:52:01.367 line:82%
-The crackdown that took place back then.
-Yes.

1062
00:52:01.433 --> 00:52:04.400 line:82%
It restricts students far too much.

1063
00:52:04.467 --> 00:52:05.767 line:82%
It's regrettable

1064
00:52:05.834 --> 00:52:08.767 line:82%
that the beautiful youths
are losing their light.

1065
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:12.700 line:82%
I'm dissatisfied
with the extreme pressure.

1066
00:52:12.767 --> 00:52:14.200 line:82%
A government official promised

1067
00:52:14.266 --> 00:52:17.033 line:82%
to establish countermeasures against…

1068
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.800 line:82%
-
As authority has been delegated…
-The news makes it clear.

1069
00:52:19.867 --> 00:52:24.300 line:82%
…the government is examining the functions
of the Social Purification Committee.

1070
00:52:24.367 --> 00:52:26.266 line:82%
Take it out and come here.

1071
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.800 line:82%
Illegal private tutoring.

1072
00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:34.700 line:82%
My goodness.

1073
00:52:35.266 --> 00:52:37.400 line:82%
Private tutoring was prohibited back then.

1074
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.467 line:82%
ILLEGAL PRIVATE TUTORING

1075
00:52:43.233 --> 00:52:45.567 line:82%
…should no longer be tormented

1076
00:52:45.633 --> 00:52:49.166 line:82%
by the hellish entrance examinations
and excessive private tutoring.

1077
00:52:49.233 --> 00:52:52.800 line:82%
The leaders of the society
should set an example

1078
00:52:52.867 --> 00:52:56.734 line:82%
and refrain from providing
private tutoring of any kind

1079
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.734 line:82%
to their children.

1080
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.166 line:82%
EXPENSIVE, ILLEGAL
PRIVATE TUTORING - HAZARD PAY

1081
00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.233 line:82%
Music and art aren't covered in tests,
so why not exclude them?

1082
00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.000 line:82%
Reduce lunchtime
from 50 minutes to 20 minutes,

1083
00:53:27.066 --> 00:53:28.867 line:82%
and let the students study for 30 minutes.

1084
00:53:28.934 --> 00:53:30.834 line:82%
You need to be number one

1085
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.800 line:82%
so that I can be a number-one mom.

1086
00:53:38.934 --> 00:53:40.300 line:82%
Let us in.

1087
00:53:44.133 --> 00:53:47.333 line:82%
We await any information
that can help us find Ms. Kim.

1088
00:53:49.033 --> 00:53:51.233 line:82%
That was why Mi-young

1089
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.200 line:82%
-was tormented.
-That was why

1090
00:53:53.266 --> 00:53:56.200 line:82%
her grades went up.
It was illegal private tutoring.

1091
00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:57.600 line:82%
-That's right.
-So…

1092
00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:59.200 line:82%
-Hey.
-That man was a tutor.

1093
00:53:59.266 --> 00:54:00.567 line:82%
I got goosebumps.

1094
00:54:02.567 --> 00:54:04.400 line:82%
-These are tutoring fees.
-He was a tutor.

1095
00:54:04.467 --> 00:54:06.767 line:82%
-"Hazard pay, 200,000 won."
-So expensive.

1096
00:54:06.834 --> 00:54:08.834 line:82%
-So the total is 500,000 won.
-Yes.

1097
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.500 line:82%
Then K, Y, and S
must represent universities.

1098
00:54:11.567 --> 00:54:15.433 line:82%
Korea University, Yonsei University,
and Seoul National University. That's it.

1099
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.467 line:82%
There's hazard pay since it's illegal.

1100
00:54:18.533 --> 00:54:19.867 line:82%
I got goosebumps.

1101
00:54:21.633 --> 00:54:24.633 line:82%
That's it. Everything adds up.

1102
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.500 line:82%
My goodness.

1103
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.400 line:82%
Is something written there?

1104
00:54:31.467 --> 00:54:33.300 line:82%
What does it say? What is it?

1105
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.300 line:82%
We should always check the food.

1106
00:54:36.367 --> 00:54:37.700 line:82%
What does it say?

1107
00:54:38.467 --> 00:54:40.300 line:82%
"Look at the books and newspaper
in unit 207."

1108
00:54:40.367 --> 00:54:41.233 line:82%
Which unit is this?

1109
00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.700 line:82%
-It's unit 209.
-Which books?

1110
00:54:45.133 --> 00:54:46.867 line:82%
Eat before the noodles get soggy.

1111
00:54:46.934 --> 00:54:47.967 line:82%
Okay.

1112
00:54:48.033 --> 00:54:49.333 line:82%
The Yus are the best.

1113
00:54:50.266 --> 00:54:52.533 line:82%
Since I'm with the younger members,

1114
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.633 line:82%
I don't even need to get up.

1115
00:54:56.266 --> 00:54:57.400 line:82%
It's tasty.

1116
00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.934 line:82%
-It's really tasty, right?
-Yes.

1117
00:55:00.066 --> 00:55:04.934 line:82%
I'm happy that we won the lunchtime game
for two consecutive weeks.

1118
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.200 line:82%
Producer, can I join the Yus
next week as well?

1119
00:55:08.033 --> 00:55:09.767 line:82%
Seriously.

1120
00:55:09.834 --> 00:55:11.300 line:82%
It's so nice.

1121
00:55:11.367 --> 00:55:13.200 line:82%
When I'm over there…

1122
00:55:13.266 --> 00:55:15.967 line:82%
Here, things get narrowed down.
There, things get broadened.

1123
00:55:17.166 --> 00:55:18.834 line:82%
-I didn't know anything.
-Things broaden?

1124
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.133 line:82%
I brought all the books.

1125
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.367 line:82%
I couldn't find the newspaper.

1126
00:55:23.433 --> 00:55:24.734 line:82%
My goodness.

1127
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.467 line:82%
-I couldn't find the newspaper.
-We need the newspaper.

1128
00:55:28.934 --> 00:55:31.433 line:82%
Here, things get narrowed down.
There, things get broadened.

1129
00:55:33.266 --> 00:55:35.667 line:82%
-Tae-hyun.
-What?

1130
00:55:35.734 --> 00:55:37.467 line:82%
-What's that?
-A newspaper.

1131
00:55:37.533 --> 00:55:39.333 line:82%
-Where was it?
-Where was it?

1132
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.367 line:82%
It was inside the shoes
in the master bedroom.

1133
00:55:41.433 --> 00:55:42.400 line:82%
Really?

1134
00:55:42.467 --> 00:55:43.567 line:82%
This is it, right?

1135
00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.100 line:82%
Isn't this it?

1136
00:55:57.767 --> 00:55:58.867 line:82%
This must be it.

1137
00:56:00.633 --> 00:56:03.700 line:82%
Everything is about private tutoring.
"Perverse tutoring."

1138
00:56:03.767 --> 00:56:04.734 line:82%
Here.

1139
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.200 line:82%
-Private tutoring?
-That's what it's about.

1140
00:56:07.266 --> 00:56:09.934 line:82%
Look at this.
"Crackdown on illegal tutoring."

1141
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.967 line:82%
Don't they know about this?

1142
00:56:12.033 --> 00:56:13.333 line:82%
-No, they don't.
-That's amazing.

1143
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.033 line:82%
-You found it over there?
-That's amazing.

1144
00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.100 line:82%
-They didn't hide it.
-No.

1145
00:56:18.166 --> 00:56:20.066 line:82%
That's amazing. How did you know?

1146
00:56:22.533 --> 00:56:23.500 line:82%
"Where."

1147
00:56:23.567 --> 00:56:26.166 line:82%
"Typewriter, bottle opener,
math workbook."

1148
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:34.767 line:82%
TYPEWRITER,
BOTTLE OPENER, MATH WORKBOOK

1149
00:56:34.834 --> 00:56:37.600 line:82%
We await any information
that can help us find Ms. Kim.

1150
00:56:46.467 --> 00:56:48.333 line:82%
I saw a typewriter somewhere.

1151
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.834 line:82%
Hold on.

1152
00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:02.700 line:82%
Where are you?

1153
00:57:03.266 --> 00:57:04.900 line:82%
Yu Jae-seok, you need to move.

1154
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.000 line:82%
What's this?

1155
00:57:07.066 --> 00:57:08.500 line:82%
Shall I look it over?

1156
00:57:10.734 --> 00:57:11.867 line:82%
Go ahead.

1157
00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.333 line:82%
What could it be?

1158
00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.800 line:82%
Was that why Na-ra
opened a bottle earlier?

1159
00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:19.300 line:82%
-What is it?
-Jae-seok.

1160
00:57:19.367 --> 00:57:21.900 line:82%
-What is it?
-Only some letters can be pressed.

1161
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.667 line:82%
-Only some letters work.
-Yes.

1162
00:57:29.734 --> 00:57:30.900 line:82%
Try it. Hold on.

1163
00:57:30.967 --> 00:57:32.533 line:82%
The ones that work are…

1164
00:57:58.066 --> 00:57:59.133 line:82%
This is it.

1165
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.734 line:82%
O* BEER - CALL POLICE

1166
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.033 line:82%
What is it?

1167
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.400 line:82%
"What's A?" It's minus one.

1168
00:58:27.467 --> 00:58:29.467 line:82%
Since it's minus one, minus seven…

1169
00:58:30.533 --> 00:58:33.700 line:82%
So, 72, 77. Minus one.

1170
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.734 line:82%
I see.

1171
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.166 line:82%
-I solved the problems.
-Really?

1172
00:58:43.233 --> 00:58:45.066 line:82%
-The answers are the same.
-What is it?

1173
00:58:45.133 --> 00:58:46.800 line:82%
Minus one.

1174
00:58:46.867 --> 00:58:48.734 line:82%
-All the answers are minus one?
-Yes.

1175
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.467 line:82%
-I figured it out.
-What is it?

1176
00:58:53.533 --> 00:58:54.700 line:82%
-It came out.
-What is it?

1177
00:58:54.767 --> 00:58:55.600 line:82%
What is it?

1178
00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.266 line:82%
Hold on. I think it's right.
It contains a
rieul,
right?

1179
00:59:00.333 --> 00:59:02.700 line:82%
"Basement"?

1180
00:59:02.767 --> 00:59:04.533 line:82%
B is missing from OB Beer.

1181
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.600 line:82%
B1.

1182
00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:07.300 line:82%
-Basement.
-And there's minus one.

1183
00:59:07.367 --> 00:59:09.200 line:82%
-The basement we saw.
-Basement.

1184
00:59:22.467 --> 00:59:25.066 line:82%
BASEMENT

1185
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.033 line:82%
Can we go there now?

1186
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.767 line:82%
-I want to eat some more.
-Go ahead.

1187
00:59:32.834 --> 00:59:35.200 line:82%
Can I eat some more? Thank you.

1188
00:59:35.266 --> 00:59:36.467 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1189
00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:37.834 line:82%
I love it here.

1190
00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:40.867 line:82%
-We're the elites.
-The elites.

1191
00:59:40.934 --> 00:59:42.700 line:82%
We're the elites.

1192
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.567 line:82%
-Is it tasty?
-Yes.

1193
00:59:48.266 --> 00:59:49.567 line:82%
-Is it tasty?
-Yes.

1194
00:59:49.633 --> 00:59:51.133 line:82%
-I'm so full.
-I know.

1195
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.600 line:82%
Would you like to…

1196
00:59:53.633 --> 00:59:54.700 line:82%
What?

1197
00:59:56.233 --> 00:59:58.133 line:82%
-Did you guys not eat?
-We did.

1198
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.300 line:82%
Look at this. Who opened it?

1199
01:00:00.867 --> 01:00:02.467 line:82%
Who opened it? See? It wasn't me.

1200
01:00:02.533 --> 01:00:04.100 line:82%
I just had a drink earlier.

1201
01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:07.500 line:82%
These people are scary.

1202
01:00:08.066 --> 01:00:10.800 line:82%
We need to go to the basement.

1203
01:00:13.934 --> 01:00:16.433 line:82%
There's something in this unit.

1204
01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.934 line:82%
-My goodness.
-What?

1205
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.133 line:82%
Why are you making it so obvious?

1206
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.300 line:82%
You guys seem to know something.

1207
01:00:24.367 --> 01:00:25.934 line:82%
What's this?

1208
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.367 line:82%
-Why did you do this?
-It's…

1209
01:00:27.433 --> 01:00:29.300 line:82%
-It must be important.
-No.

1210
01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:31.500 line:82%
Gosh, I almost fell down.

1211
01:00:31.567 --> 01:00:34.166 line:82%
-It must be important.
-No.

1212
01:00:34.233 --> 01:00:37.400 line:82%
There must be something
about the typewriter.

1213
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.633 line:82%
-It's tasty.
-Yes.

1214
01:00:40.367 --> 01:00:43.166 line:82%
Why did you suddenly bring out
this typewriter?

1215
01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.233 line:82%
I find it strange.

1216
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.500 line:82%
The items represent the era,

1217
01:00:47.567 --> 01:00:48.934 line:82%
-I think.
-It wasn't here.

1218
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.967 line:82%
-Listen, Tae-hyun.
-Does it work?

1219
01:00:52.033 --> 01:00:52.867 line:82%
Tae-hyun.

1220
01:00:53.433 --> 01:00:55.166 line:82%
-Listen, Tae-hyun. Tae-hyun.
-Does it work?

1221
01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.500 line:82%
-Let's take it.
-Why would you take it?

1222
01:01:00.567 --> 01:01:01.867 line:82%
-It's a clue.
-Let's take it.

1223
01:01:01.934 --> 01:01:03.467 line:82%
-Why would you take it?
-Let's go.

1224
01:01:03.533 --> 01:01:05.066 line:82%
-Why would you take it?
-Let's go.

1225
01:01:05.133 --> 01:01:06.367 line:82%
Isn't it a clue?

1226
01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:08.867 line:82%
-Is it okay for them to take it?
-Yes. Tae-hyun, let's go.

1227
01:01:11.767 --> 01:01:13.433 line:82%
We'll take it with us.

1228
01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:20.000 line:82%
Tae-hyun, come on.

1229
01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:26.300 line:82%
Let's go.

1230
01:01:30.266 --> 01:01:31.300 line:82%
Hurry.

1231
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.967 line:82%
Let's go.

1232
01:01:45.467 --> 01:01:46.667 line:82%
Let's go.

1233
01:01:55.133 --> 01:01:57.667 line:82%
What? Some keys don't work,
while the others do.

1234
01:01:57.734 --> 01:01:59.800 line:82%
-Hold on. In that case…

1235

I need a pen.

1236

-They'll come anyway.
-Yes.

1237
01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:06.667 line:82%
They'll come anyway,
so we should get there first.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.734 line:82%
Hurry.

1243
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.000 line:82%
The Yus are the best.

1244
01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:20.200 line:82%
-We work really fast, don't we?
-Yes.

1245
01:02:20.266 --> 01:02:21.867 line:82%
-What?
-Ha…

1246
01:02:22.767 --> 01:02:23.633 line:82%

-Ja…

1249
01:02:27.667 --> 01:02:28.967 line:82%
Basement.

1250
01:02:29.033 --> 01:02:30.166 line:82%
-Yes.
-Basement.

1251
01:02:30.233 --> 01:02:31.266 line:82%
That's right.

1252
01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:33.033 line:82%
Basement.

1253
01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.133 line:82%
It's basement, right?

1254
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.967 line:82%
-I solved it, okay?
-Okay.

1255
01:02:36.967 --> 01:02:38.300 line:82%
My urge to pee went away.

1256

-It's so scary. What's going on?
-What?

1257
01:02:44.367 --> 01:02:46.266 line:82%
Someone's studying.

1258
01:03:09.266 --> 01:03:10.300 line:82%
Hold on.

1259
01:03:10.367 --> 01:03:11.567 line:82%
What's going on?

01:03:12.734 --> 01:03:15.200 line:82%
Hold on. Ms. Kim Mi-young?

1261
01:03:15.266 --> 01:03:16.300 line:82%
What?

1262
01:03:19.934 --> 01:03:21.500 line:82%
NAME: KIM MI-YOUNG

1263
01:03:28.734 --> 01:03:31.867 line:82%
The girl who disappeared
on the 30th of last month

1264
01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:34.300 line:82%
went missing ten days ago.

1265
01:03:34.367 --> 01:03:37.834 line:82%
The police opened up the case
to the public

1266
01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.100 line:82%
and began the search
for the missing person.

1267
01:03:45.066 --> 01:03:46.600 line:82%
Are you Ms. Kim Mi-young?

1268
01:03:46.667 --> 01:03:48.767 line:82%
Yes, I'm Kim Mi-young.

1269
01:03:49.834 --> 01:03:52.100 line:82%
You're all over the news,
and people are looking for you.

1270
01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:53.867 line:82%
-Me?
-Isn't that you?

1271
01:03:53.934 --> 01:03:56.200 line:82%
I have no reason to be on the news.

1272
01:04:01.066 --> 01:04:02.834 line:82%
Where's Kim Mi-young?

1273
01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.667 line:82%
-I'm Kim Mi-young.
-She said so.

1274
01:04:05.233 --> 01:04:06.800 line:82%
-She said so in the beginning.
-I see.

1275
01:04:07.367 --> 01:04:08.633 line:82%
Hello.

1276
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.233 line:82%
Are you saying
that you never went missing?

1277
01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:15.934 line:82%
No, I never went missing.

1278
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.567 line:82%
Kim Mi-young isn't the missing girl.
It's another Ms. Kim.

1279
01:04:26.633 --> 01:04:27.800 line:82%
I see.

1280
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.100 line:82%
Aren't you the student who went missing?

1281
01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:44.433 line:82%
Oh, she's a university student
who tutors me.

1282
01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:46.700 line:82%
I see.

1283
01:04:47.367 --> 01:04:49.467 line:82%
The missing Kim must be the tutor.

1284
01:04:49.533 --> 01:04:51.300 line:82%
What's your tutor's name?

1285
01:04:51.367 --> 01:04:52.867 line:82%
It's Kim Ji-eun.

1286
01:04:57.433 --> 01:04:58.900 line:82%
This is the equation.

1287
01:05:01.467 --> 01:05:04.133 line:82%
Don't get it mixed up. Plus ab.

1288
01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:08.900 line:82%
A squared minus ab plus b squared is…

1289
01:05:10.033 --> 01:05:11.567 line:82%
This is important.

1290
01:05:18.033 --> 01:05:20.734 line:82%
Why did your tutor go missing?

1291
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.567 line:82%
I don't know much
since my mom got me a tutor,

1292
01:05:23.633 --> 01:05:25.467 line:82%
but this is apparently illegal.

1293
01:05:25.533 --> 01:05:29.000 line:82%
I think my tutor wants to come clean
in order to clear her conscience.

1294
01:05:30.767 --> 01:05:33.200 line:82%
As the prosecution began
an investigation to eradicate

1295
01:05:33.266 --> 01:05:35.900 line:82%
the illegal private tutoring
that is rampant,

1296
01:05:35.967 --> 01:05:39.166 line:82%
a student at a prestigious university
who has done illegal private tutoring

1297
01:05:39.233 --> 01:05:42.700 line:82%
called the police and voiced
her intention to turn herself in.

1298
01:05:42.767 --> 01:05:44.600 line:82%
But the university student

1299
01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:46.300 line:82%
suddenly went missing,

1300
01:05:46.367 --> 01:05:49.200 line:82%
and her whereabouts
have been unknown for days.

1301
01:05:57.967 --> 01:05:59.934 line:82%
Where is your tutor?

1302
01:06:00.867 --> 01:06:02.300 line:82%
I can't tell you that.

1303
01:06:02.367 --> 01:06:04.633 line:82%
Would you just tell us
before we force you to?

1304
01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.967 line:82%
I really can't. After all,

1305
01:06:07.533 --> 01:06:10.700 line:82%
among you are the parents
who have hired illegal private tutors

1306
01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.800 line:82%
and are now threatening the tutor.

1307
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.900 line:82%
…and are now threatening the tutor.

1308
01:06:29.967 --> 01:06:31.433 line:82%
I knew it.

1309
01:06:33.367 --> 01:06:35.000 line:82%
I need to study now.

1310
01:06:35.066 --> 01:06:36.633 line:82%
Of course. Come here.

1311
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.333 line:82%
Let's go. Bye.

1312
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.467 line:82%
This is…

1313
01:06:39.533 --> 01:06:41.266 line:82%
Jae-seok, hold on.

1314
01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:43.300 line:82%
-It's one of us.
-Don't threaten her.

1315
01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:45.867 line:82%
-It's one of us.
-Don't threaten her.

1316
01:06:45.934 --> 01:06:48.333 line:82%
What are you doing? What?

1317
01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.967 line:82%
What are you doing? What?

1318
01:06:51.033 --> 01:06:52.333 line:82%
-What?
-My goodness.

1319
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.066 line:82%
What's going on?

1320
01:06:54.133 --> 01:06:56.533 line:82%
You found it. What's in the basement?

1321
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.867 line:82%
-Hey.
-Yes?

1322
01:06:57.934 --> 01:07:00.133 line:82%
-Did you figure out the typewriter clue?
-Yes.

1323
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.233 line:82%
We figured it out.

1324
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.900 line:82%
Na-ra, come here. We'll get going.

1325
01:07:02.967 --> 01:07:03.967 line:82%
-Go on in.
-Okay.

1326
01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:05.133 line:82%
We'll get going.

1327
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.934 line:82%
-They're fast.
-They're so fast.

1328
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.500 line:82%
-She's being threatened.
-So one of us is that parent.

1329
01:07:11.567 --> 01:07:12.900 line:82%
I think so.

1330
01:07:12.967 --> 01:07:15.633 line:82%
-I understood correctly, right?
-That's right.

1331
01:07:18.533 --> 01:07:19.967 line:82%
-Kim Mi-young's tutor…
-Yes.

1332
01:07:20.033 --> 01:07:21.633 line:82%
…went missing.

1333
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.767 line:82%
She went missing

1334
01:07:23.834 --> 01:07:26.333 line:82%
because she wanted to confess
to the police,

1335
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.000 line:82%
and a parent threatened her.

1336
01:07:28.066 --> 01:07:29.600 line:82%
-She was stopped.
-Yes.

1337
01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:30.567 line:82%
So she ran away.

1338
01:07:30.633 --> 01:07:32.633 line:82%
I see. That was why she went missing.

1339
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.767 line:82%
Yes.

1340
01:07:33.834 --> 01:07:36.166 line:82%
Why did Mi-young call it prison?

1341
01:07:36.233 --> 01:07:38.934 line:82%
She was just saying
that illegal private tutoring

1342
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.100 line:82%
is like a prison.

1343
01:07:41.934 --> 01:07:44.033 line:82%
The tutor. Where's your tutor?

1344
01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.834 line:82%
This is the prison.

1345
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.266 line:82%
I can't tell you.
I'll get scolded by my mom.

1346
01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:50.567 line:82%
You won't get scolded.

1347
01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:52.567 line:82%
-I can't.
-Please tell us.

1348
01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:53.967 line:82%
I can't tell you

1349
01:07:54.033 --> 01:07:55.800 line:82%
because among you are the parents

1350
01:07:55.867 --> 01:07:57.467 line:82%
who are threatening the tutor.

1351
01:07:57.533 --> 01:08:00.400 line:82%
Gosh, this is so annoying.

1352
01:08:00.467 --> 01:08:02.500 line:82%
This is so annoying. Seriously.

1353
01:08:02.567 --> 01:08:04.000 line:82%
Is that it?

1354
01:08:04.066 --> 01:08:05.000 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Wait.

1355
01:08:05.066 --> 01:08:06.667 line:82%
-Among us?
-Among us?

1356
01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:09.567 line:82%
-Among us?
-Someone is threatening the tutor.

1357
01:08:09.633 --> 01:08:11.333 line:82%
Who's being threatened?

1358
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.266 line:82%
Hello?

1359
01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:17.300 line:82%
You're

1360
01:08:17.367 --> 01:08:19.934 line:82%
a parent who requested illegal tutoring.

1361
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.233 line:82%
My goodness.

1362
01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:26.967 line:82%
If you don't drink
four orange beverages by 2 p.m…

1363
01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:33.967 line:82%
your identity will be revealed.

1364
01:08:34.033 --> 01:08:35.500 line:82%
Understood.

1365
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.800 line:82%
-There's more.
-Someone is acting.

1366
01:08:39.867 --> 01:08:41.300 line:82%
-Hold on. Tae-hyun.
-Hold on.

1367
01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:42.233 line:82%
-It's me.
-Earlier…

1368
01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.600 line:82%
-I know.
-It's me.

1369
01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:44.834 line:82%
-Yes.
-I'm eating something.

1370
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.533 line:82%
Na-ra drives me crazy.

1371
01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.133 line:82%
It must be me, right?

1372
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.734 line:82%
I think drinking orange juice is something

1373
01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.834 line:82%
the parent needs to do.

1374
01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:58.633 line:82%
So the member
who was drinking it diligently,

1375
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.767 line:82%
Na-ra, is my guess.

1376
01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600 line:82%
That's my guess.

1377
01:09:08.367 --> 01:09:10.367 line:82%
Ms. Kim, a student,

1378
01:09:10.433 --> 01:09:12.734 line:82%
went missing ten days ago.

1379
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.900 line:82%
…and refrain from providing

1380
01:09:22.967 --> 01:09:24.900 line:82%
private tutoring of any kind
to their children.

1381
01:09:26.066 --> 01:09:27.200 line:82%
This is an announcement.

1382
01:09:27.266 --> 01:09:29.834 line:82%
I ask every resident to come
to the Senior Center.

1383
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.400 line:82%
Let's go, punks.

1384
01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:32.400 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

1385
01:09:32.467 --> 01:09:33.467 line:82%
It's her, right?

1386
01:09:33.533 --> 01:09:35.233 line:82%
Jae-seok. It's Na-ra, right?

1387
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.000 line:82%
Hey, you should defend Na-ra.

1388
01:09:37.066 --> 01:09:38.633 line:82%
-I'm going insane.
-Hey,

1389
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.166 line:82%
-I'm drinking the Fanta.
-Don't drink it.

1390
01:09:41.233 --> 01:09:43.500 line:82%
-Get in the car.
-Let's get in.

1391
01:09:43.567 --> 01:09:46.000 line:82%
-Hey.
-Hey, come on.

1392
01:09:46.066 --> 01:09:48.467 line:82%
Back in the day, this van looked so big.

1393
01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.033 line:82%
I used to ride one
to go to a tae kwon do academy.

1394
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.667 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

1395
01:10:00.266 --> 01:10:03.066 line:82%
The fragrance is refreshing.

1396
01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:05.900 line:82%
This van…

1397
01:10:05.967 --> 01:10:07.300 line:82%
My goodness.

1398
01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.300 line:82%
-Jung-ha, did you meet Na-ra here?
-Yes.

1399
01:10:11.367 --> 01:10:13.900 line:82%
-I hadn't met him before.
-I see.

1400
01:10:13.967 --> 01:10:16.133 line:82%
-I thought you were in your twenties.
-Who?

1401
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.266 line:82%
You. I thought that when I first met you.

1402
01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:19.900 line:82%
Me? In my twenties?

1403
01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:21.300 line:82%
Yes. You looked so young.

1404
01:10:21.367 --> 01:10:22.900 line:82%
I had no idea

1405
01:10:22.967 --> 01:10:25.500 line:82%
that you were older than Tae-hyun.

1406
01:10:25.567 --> 01:10:28.367 line:82%
I had no idea. I found out today.

1407
01:10:29.734 --> 01:10:31.500 line:82%
My goodness.

1408
01:10:31.567 --> 01:10:33.367 line:82%
You guys are good
at sucking up to your seniors.

1409
01:10:35.266 --> 01:10:36.500 line:82%
-You're good too.
-Yes.

1410
01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:38.967 line:82%
-You're good too.
-The youngest members are the best.

1411
01:10:39.033 --> 01:10:42.633 line:82%
The youngest members are the best.
We know how to survive in society.

1412
01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.333 line:82%
Se-chan, you shouldn't group yourself
with the youngest members.

1413
01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.667 line:82%
Jae-seok, I'm part of Generation MZ.

1414
01:10:47.734 --> 01:10:48.700 line:82%
How old are you?

1415
01:10:48.767 --> 01:10:50.734 line:82%
-I'm the captain among them.
-Gosh.

1416
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.367 line:82%
I'm 38 years old.

1417
01:10:52.433 --> 01:10:53.567 line:82%

I can't believe
I'm on the same show with you guys.

1438

Don't mention it.

1443
01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:41.433 line:82%
Give us an allowance of 50,000 won
after the shoot.

1444
01:11:42.233 --> 01:11:44.000 line:82%

1455
01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.066 line:82%
Chas.

1456
01:12:07.133 --> 01:12:10.100 line:82%
The security guard isn't here today.

1457
01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:11.600 line:82%
Hold on. Where did he go?

1458
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.767 line:82%
We'll begin the game.

1459
01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:16.700 line:82%
Is Woo-il not coming?

1460
01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:18.400 line:82%
-Where's Woo-il?
-Please.

1461
01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:19.533 line:82%
Did he go home?

1462
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.934 line:82%
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

1463
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.033 line:82%
You won't see me next week.

1464
01:12:24.533 --> 01:12:26.367 line:82%
-Woo-il.
-Please.

1465
01:12:26.433 --> 01:12:27.767 line:82%
Did he go home?

1466
01:12:27.834 --> 01:12:29.400 line:82%
-You should give him another chance.
-Yes.

1467
01:12:29.467 --> 01:12:32.633 line:82%
He's doing something else.
He delegated the responsibility.

1468
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.967 line:82%
-Today, I'll move things along quickly.
-Okay.

1469
01:12:35.033 --> 01:12:35.867 line:82%
Understood.

1470
01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:39.233 line:82%
We need to win the game
in order to receive a clue.

1471
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.967 line:82%
You get a good clue if you win.

1472
01:12:41.033 --> 01:12:44.233 line:82%
The winners will receive a clue
on the missing tutor.

1473
01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.200 line:82%
The winners?

1474
01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:47.600 line:82%

The winners?

1476
01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:51.734 line:82%
My goodness.

1477
01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.333 line:82%
Why is a bottle of orange juice here?

1478
01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.367 line:82%
Why is a bottle of orange juice here?

1479
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.200 line:82%
Be quiet.

1480
01:12:58.266 --> 01:13:01.300 line:82%
Feign ignorance.

1481
01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:03.200 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Yes?

1482
01:13:03.266 --> 01:13:04.600 line:82%
Don't drink that. Seriously.

1483
01:13:06.033 --> 01:13:08.166 line:82%
Don't drink that. I'll stop you.

1484
01:13:08.233 --> 01:13:09.500 line:82%
Let's feign ignorance.

1485
01:13:09.567 --> 01:13:13.066 line:82%
I won't let you drink it so openly.

1486
01:13:42.433 --> 01:13:46.467 line:82%
All right. We'll play a game called
Make It Make Sense.

1487
01:13:46.533 --> 01:13:49.066 line:82%
-Make It Make Sense.
-Make It Make Sense.

1488
01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:52.133 line:82%
Gosh, it sounds like a difficult game.

1489
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.467 line:82%
-Make It Make Sense.
-Let me explain the rules of the game.

1490
01:13:55.533 --> 01:13:57.166 line:82%
I'll give you a syllable.

1491
01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:58.667 line:82%
Let's say I go, "Ty."

1492
01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:01.900 line:82%
Ty. Ranno. Saur. Us. Make it make sense.

1493

01:14:06.834 --> 01:14:09.367 line:82%
Gang. Doenjang. Bi. Bimbap.

1497
01:14:09.433 --> 01:14:10.734 line:82%

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.633 line:82%
-We give a syllable or two.
-Okay.

1499
01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.000 line:82%
-Not bad.
-Okay.

1500
01:14:14.066 --> 01:14:16.400 line:82%
You can only give one or two syllables.

1501
01:14:16.467 --> 01:14:17.600 line:82%
One or two. Okay.

1502
01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:18.900 line:82%
-Let's try it.
-Let's go.

-It doesn't exist.

1517
01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:55.867 line:82%
You never went

-Okay. It doesn't exist.
-Why not?

1524
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.400 line:82%
-It exists in Gyeongju.
-Then adding Daegu or Busan would work.

1525
01:15:10.467 --> 01:15:12.233 line:82%
-It doesn't exist.
-No?

1526
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.700 line:82%
-There's no bibimbap in Gyeongju?
-It should be a representative dish.

1527
01:15:15.767 --> 01:15:16.800 line:82%

1570
01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:47.667 line:82%
It was an actual show.
People Are Good
.

1571
01:16:47.734 --> 01:16:49.567 line:82%
The title was
Human Documentary, People Are Good
.

1572
01:16:49.633 --> 01:16:51.934 line:82%
-Then it doesn't work.
-It works, right?

1573
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.967 line:82%
Human Documentary
.

1574
01:16:53.033 --> 01:16:55.300 line:82%

Human Documentary, People Are Good

-So close.

1575
01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.367 line:82%
Ready, go.

1576
01:16:58.433 --> 01:16:59.767 line:82%
Yu.

1577
01:16:59.834 --> 01:17:01.900 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-Face.

1578
01:17:01.967 --> 01:17:04.066 line:82%
-Bad.
-That's it.

1579
01:17:04.133 --> 01:17:06.033 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-Face.

1580
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:08.667 line:82%
-Bad.
-That's it.

1581
01:17:08.734 --> 01:17:10.233 line:82%
-Face.
-Bad.

1582
01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.400 line:82%
-That's it.
-Hey.

1583
01:17:12.467 --> 01:17:14.433 line:82%
-That's it.
-Hey.

1584
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.633 line:82%
His face is bad. Look at his face.

1585
01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.266 line:82%
Look at his face. It's bad.

1586
01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.633 line:82%
-Hey.
-What?

1587
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.867 line:82%
His face is bad. Just look.

1588
01:17:21.934 --> 01:17:23.467 line:82%
Look at his face. It sucks.

1589
01:17:23.533 --> 01:17:24.867 line:82%
-Hey.
-What?

1590
01:17:25.967 --> 01:17:29.166 line:82%
It makes sense.
It's suitable for variety shows.

1591
01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:30.600 line:82%
-Seriously.
-For variety shows.

1592
01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:32.633 line:82%
-I'll look it up on Naver.
-Hey.

1593
01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:33.800 line:82%
Why would it be on Naver?

1594
01:17:33.867 --> 01:17:35.500 line:82%
-Every Korean…
-Don't look it up.

1595
01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:37.533 line:82%
…knows that Jae-seok's face is bad.

1596
01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.734 line:82%
-That's right.
-Are there no results?

1597
01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.000 line:82%
-No results.
-There are no results.

1598
01:17:43.066 --> 01:17:46.033 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-No results.

1599
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.333 line:82%
Naver. No results.

1600
01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.100 line:82%
It was a good answer.

1601
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.533 line:82%
See? Naver acknowledges my face.

1602
01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.600 line:82%
Naver. No results.

1603
01:17:55.667 --> 01:17:56.867 line:82%
I'll give you another chance.

1604
01:17:56.934 --> 01:17:58.800 line:82%
-Okay.
-Let's go. Tae-hyun first.

1605
01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:00.066 line:82%
Okay.

1606
01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:03.467 line:82%
Let's begin. Make It Make Sense.
Ready, go.

1607
01:18:03.533 --> 01:18:04.967 line:82%
Ro.

1608
01:18:05.033 --> 01:18:06.500 line:82%
Hong-chul.

1609
01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.567 line:82%
Store.

1610
01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:10.600 line:82%
Hong-chul.

1611
01:18:11.834 --> 01:18:12.834 line:82%
Store.

1612
01:18:14.333 --> 01:18:15.734 line:82%
Good.

1613
01:18:16.967 --> 01:18:18.834 line:82%
Good.

1614
01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.767 line:82%
-Hey.
-Hong-chul's store is great.

1615
01:18:20.834 --> 01:18:23.266 line:82%
-Hong-chul's store is great.
-This is ridiculous.

1616
01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:27.567 line:82%
What's up with you guys?
Was that a sponsored ad?

1617
01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:31.166 line:82%
-They're suspicious.
-What are you guys doing?

1618
01:18:31.233 --> 01:18:32.700 line:82%
-What are you guys doing?
-You know,

1619
01:18:32.767 --> 01:18:35.967 line:82%
-it was nice. Look it up.
-Ro.

1620
01:18:36.033 --> 01:18:37.700 line:82%
-And--
-Na-ra, don't use names.

1621
01:18:37.767 --> 01:18:40.333 line:82%
-He says things like "bad."
-I know.

1622
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.533 line:82%
-I--
-"Bad" and "good."

1623
01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.867 line:82%
How annoying. We were so close.

1624
01:18:44.934 --> 01:18:47.300 line:82%
Anyone can see
that was a landslide victory.

1625
01:18:47.367 --> 01:18:49.800 line:82%
-The Yus won.
-Yes.

1626
01:18:51.667 --> 01:18:52.834 line:82%
Yes.

1627
01:18:53.667 --> 01:18:54.834 line:82%
Okay.

1628
01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.100 line:82%
-All right.
-Se-chan is a delinquent.

1629
01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:58.266 line:82%
Give it to us.

1630
01:19:12.533 --> 01:19:15.934 line:82%
Jae-seok, we don't know how it feels
to fail to receive a hint.

1631
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.066 line:82%
-You're the best.
-See, Jung-ha?

1632
01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:19.500 line:82%
We have incredible teamwork.

1633
01:19:19.567 --> 01:19:21.033 line:82%
The clues for where.

1634
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.066 line:82%
-"Paper."
-"Paper, world, and ramyeon"?

1635
01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:25.333 line:82%
"Paper and world and ramyeon"?

1636
01:19:26.233 --> 01:19:27.233 line:82%
"Ramyeon"?

1637
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:32.934 line:82%
Kim Mi-young isn't the missing girl.
It's another Ms. Kim.

1638
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.266 line:82%
I see.

1639
01:19:34.834 --> 01:19:36.467 line:82%
Where is your tutor?

1640
01:19:36.533 --> 01:19:39.200 line:82%
I can't tell you that.

1641
01:19:43.967 --> 01:19:46.967 line:82%
Okay. Let's watch it.

1642
01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.233 line:82%
What? It's "To You."

1643
01:19:57.066 --> 01:19:58.500 line:82%
What? It's "To You."

1644
01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.333 line:82%
Those were the days.

1645
01:20:16.467 --> 01:20:18.533 line:82%
A tiger.

1646
01:20:28.133 --> 01:20:29.133 line:82%
What?

1647
01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:40.400 line:82%
What?

1648
01:20:40.467 --> 01:20:41.367 line:82%
Is that all?

1649
01:20:42.367 --> 01:20:43.600 line:82%
Maybe it's broken.

1650
01:20:43.667 --> 01:20:45.433 line:82%
-What?
-Is that really the hint?

1651
01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:46.500 line:82%
What's this?

1652
01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:49.667 line:82%
The '88 Olympics.

1653
01:21:09.066 --> 01:21:10.266 line:82%
-What?
-I think I know.

1654
01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:12.133 line:82%
-What?
-I think I know.

1655
01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.633 line:82%
What is it?

1656
01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.266 line:82%
-I think I know too.
-What?

1657
01:21:17.333 --> 01:21:18.233 line:82%
Go ahead.

1658
01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:19.867 line:82%

Deok-sun gets tutored
by her older sister, Bo-ra.

1660
01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:25.033 line:82%
-Maybe Ji-eun is Mi-young's older sister.
-No.

1661
01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.467 line:82%
You're completely wrong.

1662
01:21:27.533 --> 01:21:30.133 line:82%
You're completely wrong.

1663
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.266 line:82%
Am I wrong?

1664
01:21:31.333 --> 01:21:33.033 line:82%
What is it?

1665
01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.600 line:82%
-It's too… Maybe I'm wrong.
-Guess.

1666
01:21:34.667 --> 01:21:36.934 line:82%
-It's too easy.
-What is it?

1667
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.133 line:82%
What was written on the tape?

1668
01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.266 line:82%
-Paper…
-World and ramyeon.

1669
01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:44.467 line:82%
PAPER AND WORLD AND RAMYEON

1670
01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.800 line:82%
-World.
-"World" tipped me off. Paper cup.

1671
01:21:52.867 --> 01:21:54.600 line:82%
World Cup.

1672
01:21:54.667 --> 01:21:57.600 line:82%
Paper cup. World Cup.

1673
01:21:57.667 --> 01:21:59.800 line:82%
-Cup ramyeon.
-Cup ramyeon.

1674
01:21:59.867 --> 01:22:01.000 line:82%
So it's cup.

1675
01:22:13.133 --> 01:22:14.166 line:82%
See? Cup.

1676
01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:16.867 line:82%
-Cup.
-Water is being poured.

1677
01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:21.300 line:82%
I guess we need to pour water into a cup.

1678
01:22:29.834 --> 01:22:31.834 line:82%
Hodori.

1679
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:36.166 line:82%
Maybe we should pour water
into a cup with Hodori.

1680
01:22:39.734 --> 01:22:41.066 line:82%
I saw that cup.

1681
01:22:43.066 --> 01:22:44.233 line:82%
What could it be?

1682
01:22:48.567 --> 01:22:49.500 line:82%
Hodori.

1683
01:22:52.633 --> 01:22:54.000 line:82%
I saw a glass like that.

1684
01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.233 line:82%
Hey, hurry.

1685
01:22:58.300 --> 01:22:59.700 line:82%
We're the best.

1686
01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.066 line:82%
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

1687
01:23:05.266 --> 01:23:09.700 line:82%
They were eavesdropping
outside the window.

1688
01:23:11.033 --> 01:23:14.934 line:82%
They were eavesdropping
outside the window.

1689
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.200 line:82%
Come on.

1690
01:23:16.266 --> 01:23:19.400 line:82%
JENNIE looked right at me.

1691
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.600 line:82%
-But…
-"Hand in Hand."

1692
01:23:22.667 --> 01:23:25.467 line:82%
-I couldn't hear anything.
-The '88 Olympics.

1693
01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:26.734 line:82%
We heard "Hand in Hand."

1694
01:23:27.467 --> 01:23:28.900 line:82%
We were too careless.

1695
01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:30.066 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1696
01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.667 line:82%
-Did you hear it?
-We couldn't hear anything.

1697
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.800 line:82%
There must be a clue here.

1698
01:23:36.867 --> 01:23:38.800 line:82%
-Why is everyone coming here?
-Is there a clue here?

1699
01:23:38.867 --> 01:23:40.333 line:82%
Is there a clue here?

1700
01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.367 line:82%
What is it?

1701
01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:50.567 line:82%
There must be a clue here.

1702
01:23:50.633 --> 01:23:52.200 line:82%
-We're here to catch him.
-Se-chan.

1703
01:23:52.266 --> 01:23:54.967 line:82%
-No. I couldn't hear.
-Are you a delinquent?

1704
01:23:55.033 --> 01:23:56.633 line:82%
-I couldn't hear.
-What did you hear?

1705
01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.433 line:82%
Se-chan is a delinquent.

1706
01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.667 line:82%
I didn't hear anything.

1707
01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.600 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Se-chan is a delinquent.

1708
01:24:05.934 --> 01:24:07.567 line:82%
-Se-chan is a delinquent.
-Come here.

1709
01:24:07.633 --> 01:24:09.333 line:82%
How much did you hear?

1710
01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.000 line:82%
World Cup.

1711
01:24:11.066 --> 01:24:12.867 line:82%
-You heard that?
-I just heard, "cup."

1712
01:24:12.934 --> 01:24:15.500 line:82%
-What's "cup"?
-Well…

1713
01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:28.567 line:82%
Hold on. Hodori.

1714
01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.433 line:82%
Hold on. Hodori.

1715
01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.333 line:82%
Hodori. Why is Hodori important?

1716
01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.600 line:82%
Seriously. Did you come here for this?

1717
01:24:36.667 --> 01:24:38.934 line:82%
We won't give it away.

1718
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.100 line:82%
We won't give it away.

1719
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.133 line:82%
We won't give it away.

1720
01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.500 line:82%
We won't give it away. What's going on?

1721
01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.033 line:82%
Why this?

1722
01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:57.300 line:82%
They came for this.

1723
01:24:57.367 --> 01:24:58.467 line:82%
For Hodori? Why?

1724
01:24:58.533 --> 01:24:59.834 line:82%
They came for this.

1725
01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.166 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1726
01:25:01.233 --> 01:25:03.533 line:82%
What are you looking for?
Let's go over there

1727
01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.667 line:82%
-and watch the videotape.
-Tell us. We don't have a clue.

1728
01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:09.266 line:82%
Go to our unit and check out the hint.

1729
01:25:09.333 --> 01:25:12.200 line:82%
Or the gap will be too big.

1730
01:25:12.266 --> 01:25:13.700 line:82%
Go and watch it.

1731
01:25:13.767 --> 01:25:15.800 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Here.

1732
01:25:15.867 --> 01:25:17.033 line:82%
I'm giving you a chance.

1733
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.233 line:82%
-Really?
-Or the gap will be too big.

1734
01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.633 line:82%
-Na-ra, let's watch it.
-Okay. Let's do that.

1735
01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.266 line:82%
You have to watch it first.

1736
01:25:23.333 --> 01:25:24.800 line:82%
It's best that you watch it.

1737
01:25:31.166 --> 01:25:33.233 line:82%
Let's put away Hodori.

1738
01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:36.600 line:82%
-Hodori.
-Can I drink some juice?

1739
01:25:36.667 --> 01:25:38.433 line:82%
-No.
-Can I drink Fanta?

1740
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:39.533 line:82%
Let's drink it.

1741
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.000 line:82%
-No, Na-ra.
-Come on.

1742
01:25:42.066 --> 01:25:44.934 line:82%
-Let's watch it.
-I'll watch it as I drink.

1743
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.133 line:82%
Okay.

1744
01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.700 line:82%
Hold on. Let's see what the clue is.

1745
01:25:52.667 --> 01:25:55.633 line:82%
Where is it? I can't find it.

1746
01:26:09.266 --> 01:26:11.166 line:82%
Can you see anything?

1747
01:26:11.233 --> 01:26:12.500 line:82%
Were we wrong?

1748
01:26:17.433 --> 01:26:18.500 line:82%
What?

1749
01:26:19.734 --> 01:26:21.400 line:82%
This is insane.

1750
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.100 line:82%
This is insane.

1751
01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:27.166 line:82%
What?

1752
01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:29.867 line:82%
This is insane.

1753
01:26:29.934 --> 01:26:31.066 line:82%
What?

1754
01:26:31.133 --> 01:26:32.600 line:82%
This is insane.

1755
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.266 line:82%
LET'S PASS
THE PUBLIC SERVICE EXAMINATION

1756
01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:44.600 line:82%
IT'S OVER IF I GET CAUGHT

1757
01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:46.233 line:82%
STUDY BEFORE GOING TO BED

1758
01:26:46.867 --> 01:26:48.533 line:82%
GIVE ME A PASS OR GIVE ME DEATH

1759
01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.333 line:82%
-What?
-This is insane.

1760
01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.533 line:82%
-This is insane.
-What?

1761
01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.967 line:82%
The tutor is here.

1762
01:27:02.033 --> 01:27:03.433 line:82%
We found the tutor.

1763
01:27:04.467 --> 01:27:06.300 line:82%
Private tutoring companies

1764
01:27:06.367 --> 01:27:09.100 line:82%
that sell workbooks
to middle school and high school students

1765
01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:11.500 line:82%
and offer lessons are on the rise.

1766
01:27:11.567 --> 01:27:15.300 line:82%
Perverse private tutoring methods
are beginning to pop up.

1767
01:27:15.367 --> 01:27:17.633 line:82%
-What?
-What? I didn't know about this.

1768
01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.967 line:82%
We'll learn a few idioms.

1769
01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.700 line:82%
Al Capone, who ruled the US…

1770
01:27:22.767 --> 01:27:23.767 line:82%
Hello?

1771
01:27:26.934 --> 01:27:27.867 line:82%
What was that?

1772
01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.000 line:82%
Perverse private tutoring methods

1773
01:27:30.066 --> 01:27:33.433 line:82%
include tape tutoring which involves
recording lessons on tapes…

1774
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.934 line:82%
We'll learn a few idioms. Al Capone…

1775
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.667 line:82%
…phone tutoring over home phones…

1776
01:27:40.367 --> 01:27:43.333 line:82%
car tutoring in which students study
in a moving car

1777
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.900 line:82%
on the highway…

1778
01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:57.100 line:82%
and live-in tutoring, where the tutor
pretends to be a housekeeper,

1779
01:27:57.166 --> 01:27:58.633 line:82%
and lives with the student.

1780
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.900 line:82%
The Social Purification Committee
decided to strengthen regulations

1781
01:28:03.967 --> 01:28:06.000 line:82%
because perverse private tutoring methods

1782
01:28:06.066 --> 01:28:08.767 line:82%
are predicted to become popular.

1783
01:28:08.834 --> 01:28:09.967 line:82%
Thus, the committee

1784
01:28:10.033 --> 01:28:12.567 line:82%
will collect intel
and conduct an internal investigation

1785
01:28:12.633 --> 01:28:15.033 line:82%
to find and penalize
those who are involved

1786
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.300 line:82%
with illegal tutoring.

1787
01:28:33.467 --> 01:28:35.867 line:82%
The tutor is here. We found the tutor.

1788
01:28:35.934 --> 01:28:38.633 line:82%
-Hurry up and come with us.
-Hurry up.

1789
01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:40.367 line:82%
-It's okay. Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

1790
01:28:40.433 --> 01:28:42.166 line:82%
-Hurry up.
-It's okay.

1791
01:28:42.233 --> 01:28:43.533 line:82%
Are you okay?

1792
01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.367 line:82%
What should we do? How can we help you?

1793
01:28:45.433 --> 01:28:46.433 line:82%
Ms. Kim.

1794
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.066 line:82%
-I'm the one who was reported missing.
-The tutor.

1795
01:28:49.133 --> 01:28:50.133 line:82%
Ms. Kim.

1796
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.400 line:82%
I'm going to drink the juice.

1797
01:28:55.467 --> 01:28:59.900 line:82%
-Se-chan, I'm drinking the juice.
-Go ahead. What?

1798
01:28:59.967 --> 01:29:02.233 line:82%
-Go back inside.
-Go back inside.

1799
01:29:02.867 --> 01:29:06.000 line:82%
-Go back inside.
-Go back inside.

1800
01:29:08.066 --> 01:29:09.867 line:82%
-Go inside.
-Hurry up.

1801
01:29:10.667 --> 01:29:12.200 line:82%
One, two.

1802
01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.033 line:82%
I can't find it.

1803
01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.367 line:82%
-You locked the door. Hey.
-Why did you lock it?

1804
01:29:17.433 --> 01:29:19.367 line:82%
-You locked the door. Hey.
-Why did you lock it?

1805
01:29:19.433 --> 01:29:20.934 line:82%
You locked the door.

1806
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.900 line:82%
I don't know how to open it.

1807
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:28.033 line:82%
-I can't find it.
-Seriously.

1808
01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:29.300 line:82%
-I don't know.
-What?

1809
01:29:29.367 --> 01:29:31.033 line:82%
Guys, I'm drinking juice.

1810
01:29:33.266 --> 01:29:36.033 line:82%
Why did you give us a fake video?

1811
01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:37.767 line:82%
It isn't fake. You must watch it.

1812
01:29:37.834 --> 01:29:39.934 line:82%
-There was nothing on it.
-Nothing was on it.

1813
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.667 line:82%
It isn't fake. You must watch it.

1814
01:29:41.734 --> 01:29:43.734 line:82%
-There was nothing on it.
-Nothing was on it.

1815
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.367 line:82%
There's another video, isn't there?

1816
01:29:45.867 --> 01:29:47.467 line:82%
-There must be.
-No.

1817
01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.000 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-To the room.

1818
01:29:52.066 --> 01:29:53.667 line:82%
-What are you looking for?
-Where is she going?

1819
01:29:53.734 --> 01:29:57.000 line:82%
Catch JENNIE. What's in this unit?

1820
01:30:00.467 --> 01:30:03.734 line:82%
Gosh, it hurts my pride.
I'm drinking the juice.

1821
01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.767 line:82%
Gosh, it hurts my pride.
I'm drinking the juice.

1822
01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:08.100 line:82%
No one's stopping me.

1823
01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:09.900 line:82%
Gosh.

1824
01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.166 line:82%
Hey.

1825
01:30:16.233 --> 01:30:17.967 line:82%
Eat one.

1826
01:30:18.033 --> 01:30:19.200 line:82%
Hold on.

1827
01:30:19.967 --> 01:30:22.133 line:82%
This is… I…

1828
01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.500 line:82%
-What?
-Why is no one stopping JENNIE?

1829
01:30:29.433 --> 01:30:31.500 line:82%
-What?
-Why is no one stopping JENNIE?

1830
01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:35.633 line:82%
-I'm drinking it.
-Okay.

1831
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.166 line:82%
What? What's that?

1832
01:30:41.233 --> 01:30:42.867 line:82%
-What?
-What's that?

1833
01:30:43.934 --> 01:30:44.834 line:82%
What's that?

1834
01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.367 line:82%
Why did you go in there?

1835
01:30:47.433 --> 01:30:49.400 line:82%
-What's this?
-What's this?

1836
01:30:49.467 --> 01:30:51.400 line:82%
-What's this?
-What's this?

1837
01:30:51.467 --> 01:30:52.834 line:82%
Hold on.

1838
01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.400 line:82%
What's this? Who are you?

1839
01:30:54.467 --> 01:30:57.000 line:82%
In order to avoid the crackdown,

1840
01:30:57.066 --> 01:30:59.934 line:82%
I hid here every day.

1841
01:31:04.066 --> 01:31:06.033 line:82%
I hid here every day.

1842
01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:07.300 line:82%
Ms. Kim.

1843
01:31:07.367 --> 01:31:09.266 line:82%
-I always felt anxious.
-Are you the tutor?

1844
01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:11.600 line:82%
She used to do illegal tutoring.

1845
01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:13.133 line:82%
She's the missing tutor.

1846
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.633 line:82%
-The tutor?
-Who found her?

1847
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:18.100 line:82%
We found the tutor,
but I think there's more to it.

1848
01:31:18.166 --> 01:31:19.066 line:82%
Please tell us.

1849
01:31:19.133 --> 01:31:22.967 line:82%
I planned to hold a press conference
and come clean.

1850
01:31:23.033 --> 01:31:27.367 line:82%
I have a list of parents
who hired me for illegal tutoring.

1851
01:31:27.433 --> 01:31:29.433 line:82%
This is the ledger
of my illegal tutoring sessions.

1852
01:31:35.667 --> 01:31:40.033 line:82%
But since I'm getting blackmailed,
I can't tell the truth.

1853
01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:42.700 line:82%
There's one thing I know.

1854
01:31:42.767 --> 01:31:44.600 line:82%
-What is it?
-Please tell us.

1855
01:31:44.667 --> 01:31:46.433 line:82%
-What is it?
-Please tell us.

1856
01:31:47.533 --> 01:31:53.967 line:82%
In this group, there are parents
who hired me for illegal tutoring.

1857
01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.166 line:82%
-We know.
-There are four.

1858
01:32:00.233 --> 01:32:01.166 line:82%
Four?

1859
01:32:01.233 --> 01:32:02.433 line:82%
-We know.
-There are four.

1860
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.600 line:82%
Four?

1861
01:32:03.667 --> 01:32:04.667 line:82%
-Four?
-Hey.

1862
01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.133 line:82%
-There are four.
-Four?

1863
01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.867 line:82%
-Four?
-Hey.

1864
01:32:09.934 --> 01:32:11.100 line:82%
-Hey.
-Hey.

1865
01:32:11.166 --> 01:32:13.266 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-Come here.

1866
01:32:13.333 --> 01:32:15.333 line:82%
-It isn't me. Is it you?
-Come here.

1867
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.467 line:82%
It isn't me.

1868
01:32:16.533 --> 01:32:18.800 line:82%
-Is it you?
-No, it isn't me.

1869
01:32:25.533 --> 01:32:27.567 line:82%
-Juice drinkers, come forward.
-Juice.

1870
01:32:27.633 --> 01:32:28.767 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-Juice.

1871
01:32:28.834 --> 01:32:31.100 line:82%
-You drank it.
-I only did when everyone else did.

1872
01:32:31.166 --> 01:32:32.867 line:82%
Who didn't drink juice?

1873
01:32:33.367 --> 01:32:35.667 line:82%
There must be a parasite in her body.

1874
01:32:35.734 --> 01:32:36.900 line:82%
Everyone is…

1875
01:32:48.266 --> 01:32:49.266 line:82%
I got chills.

1876
01:32:49.333 --> 01:32:53.600 line:82%
I… I just know the faces
of the students I taught.

1877
01:32:53.667 --> 01:32:55.734 line:82%
I don't know the faces of the parents.

1878
01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.266 line:82%
I ask the two innocent civilians

1879
01:32:58.333 --> 01:33:00.200 line:82%
to pluck up their courage

1880
01:33:00.266 --> 01:33:03.400 line:82%
to stop the four parents
who hired illegal tutors

1881
01:33:03.467 --> 01:33:05.567 line:82%
and report them.

1882
01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.867 line:82%
-Four of us?
-What?

1883
01:33:13.934 --> 01:33:15.033 line:82%
-Hold on.
-Hold on.

1884
01:33:15.633 --> 01:33:17.300 line:82%
-Hold on.
-Hold on.

1885
01:33:17.367 --> 01:33:19.000 line:82%
Gosh, things are getting dirty.

1886
01:33:19.066 --> 01:33:20.100 line:82%
What should I do?

1887
01:33:20.166 --> 01:33:21.567 line:82%
-Jung-ha, give it to me.
-This is…

1888
01:33:21.633 --> 01:33:23.867 line:82%
-This is…
-Give it to me.

1889
01:33:23.934 --> 01:33:26.166 line:82%
-Let's see it.
-You guys are too much. Seriously.

1890
01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.266 line:82%
Bong-seok.

1891
01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:29.934 line:82%
-Let's see it.
-You guys are too much. Seriously.

1892
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.133 line:82%
I really am a civilian.

1893
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.500 line:82%
I really am a civilian.

1894
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.467 line:82%
Come here.

1895
01:33:35.533 --> 01:33:38.033 line:82%
-What's up with you?
-Is that how it's going to be?

1896
01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:39.934 line:82%
-Come on out.
-Come on out.

1897
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.133 line:82%
-Come on out.
-Come on out.

1898
01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.700 line:82%
-I feel so betrayed.
-My goodness.

1899
01:33:44.767 --> 01:33:46.266 line:82%
I really am a civilian.

1900
01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:48.600 line:82%
I can confidently say
that I'm one of the two.

1901
01:33:48.667 --> 01:33:52.333 line:82%
-I'm a civilian too.
-I'm a civilian too.

1902
01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.633 line:82%
I really am a civilian.

1903
01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:56.734 line:82%
-Hey. Jung-ha, I'm the other one.
-Four?

1904
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.700 line:82%
I'm the other one.

1905
01:33:57.767 --> 01:33:59.734 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-Jae-seok, I'm a civilian

1906
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.300 line:82%
-this time.
-My goodness.

1907
01:34:01.367 --> 01:34:02.800 line:82%
Na-ra isn't a civilian.

1908
01:34:02.867 --> 01:34:04.500 line:82%
Na-ra isn't a civilian.

1909
01:34:04.567 --> 01:34:06.600 line:82%
Na-ra isn't a civilian.

1910
01:34:06.667 --> 01:34:07.967 line:82%
-Stay out.
-She's a parent.

1911
01:34:08.033 --> 01:34:11.200 line:82%
-Na-ra, you need to make the call.
-She got caught.

1912
01:34:12.133 --> 01:34:13.834 line:82%
-Let's take a look.
-Shall we?

1913
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:14.900 line:82%
Let's take a look first.

1914
01:34:22.934 --> 01:34:24.834 line:82%
"The house that plucks stars
from the sky"?

1915
01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:25.900 line:82%
"Seoul slicker"?

1916
01:34:25.967 --> 01:34:28.367 line:82%
"The house that plucks stars from the sky.
Seoul slicker."

1917
01:34:28.433 --> 01:34:31.066 line:82%
Three and four. I mean, three and one.

1918
01:34:31.567 --> 01:34:33.166 line:82%
Three people and one person.

1919
01:34:33.233 --> 01:34:35.266 line:82%
NUMBER OF PEOPLE: THREE, ONE

1920
01:34:36.233 --> 01:34:38.700 line:82%
Here it is.
"Lee Jung-ha doesn't have children."

1921
01:34:38.767 --> 01:34:41.066 line:82%
So Jung-ha isn't a parent.

1922
01:34:41.133 --> 01:34:43.300 line:82%
I'm an innocent civilian.

1923
01:34:51.934 --> 01:34:53.033 line:82%
Testing.

1924
01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:56.467 line:82%
This is an announcement for the residents.

1925
01:34:56.533 --> 01:35:02.333 line:82%
In the group, there are four parents
who requested illegal tutoring

1926
01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.200 line:82%
and two innocent civilians.

1927
01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:09.967 line:82%
The two innocent civilians

1928
01:35:10.033 --> 01:35:12.900 line:82%
must come to the press conference
at the rooftop by 3 p.m.

1929
01:35:12.967 --> 01:35:15.734 line:82%
and reveal your identity.

1930
01:35:16.567 --> 01:35:18.500 line:82%
While tutoring is prohibited by law,

1931
01:35:18.567 --> 01:35:20.700 line:82%
a university student
who did illegal tutoring

1932
01:35:20.767 --> 01:35:22.433 line:82%
turned herself in.

1933
01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.100 line:82%
She confessed to tutoring students

1934
01:35:25.166 --> 01:35:28.133 line:82%
while living in the houses
of high-ranking officials.

1935
01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:31.033 line:82%
The fact that these parents
threatened the tutor

1936
01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.000 line:82%
before she turned herself in

1937
01:35:33.066 --> 01:35:34.533 line:82%
shocked everyone.

1938
01:35:35.233 --> 01:35:38.867 line:82%
The police promised
a thorough investigation

1939
01:35:38.934 --> 01:35:42.834 line:82%
and to keep a watchful eye on
the crackdown of illegal tutoring.

1940
01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.800 line:82%
The two innocent civilians,
come to the press conference

1941
01:35:56.867 --> 01:36:00.233 line:82%
and reveal your identity.

1942
01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:03.500 line:82%
If a parent who requested illegal tutoring

1943
01:36:03.567 --> 01:36:05.934 line:82%
pairs up with one innocent civilian

1944
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.133 line:82%
and reveals his or her identity,

1945
01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.934 line:82%
punishing the illegal tutoring will fail.

1946
01:36:14.433 --> 01:36:16.400 line:82%
LEE JUNG-HA
DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN

1947
01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.867 line:82%
This is…

1948
01:36:18.934 --> 01:36:22.066 line:82%
-I want to read it.
-Okay.

1949
01:36:27.867 --> 01:36:29.800 line:82%
"Seoul slicker" is Jae-seok.

1950
01:36:29.867 --> 01:36:30.900 line:82%
Right.

1951
01:36:30.967 --> 01:36:32.800 line:82%
No, it isn't me.

1952
01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.700 line:82%
What? "The house
that plucks stars from the sky"?

1953
01:36:36.767 --> 01:36:40.567 line:82%
Plucking stars from the sky

1954
01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:46.100 line:82%
I'll pluck stars from the sky
I'll pluck the moon from the sky

1955
01:36:46.166 --> 01:36:50.367 line:82%
-
I'll put them in your hands
-
Oran-C

1956
01:36:50.934 --> 01:36:52.300 line:82%
Oran-C.

1957
01:36:52.367 --> 01:36:53.667 line:82%
-Oran-C?
-Oran-C.

1958
01:36:53.734 --> 01:36:54.734 line:82%
It was in our unit.

1959
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.400 line:82%
Unit 209.

1960
01:37:04.133 --> 01:37:06.467 line:82%
These are drinks from back in the day.

1961
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.033 line:82%
-Unit 209.
-Oran-C.

1962
01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:15.100 line:82%
NUMBER OF PEOPLE: THREE

1963
01:37:15.166 --> 01:37:17.667 line:82%
-I don't know.
-Unit 209.

1964
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:22.500 line:82%
-Hold on.
-What?

1965
01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.800 line:82%
-Hold on.
-What?

1966
01:37:24.867 --> 01:37:27.000 line:82%
All three of them are parents.

1967
01:37:27.066 --> 01:37:29.233 line:82%
-That unit has Oran-C.
-Yes.

1968
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:30.734 line:82%
-Three.
-They're parents. Leave.

1969
01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.333 line:82%
Hey!

1970
01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.300 line:82%
-You punk! Today, you… You punk!
-No.

1971
01:37:35.367 --> 01:37:38.800 line:82%
How could you make a fool out of me?

1972
01:37:39.767 --> 01:37:41.066 line:82%
Hello. Who are you?

1973
01:37:41.567 --> 01:37:44.500 line:82%
You're a parent
who requested illegal tutoring.

1974
01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:45.500 line:82%
Okay.

1975
01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.967 line:82%
-I don't hear the bell.
-You'll hear it.

1976
01:37:57.033 --> 01:37:58.700 line:82%
-Really?
-How cool.

1977
01:38:06.367 --> 01:38:08.266 line:82%
The three of you are parents.

1978
01:38:08.333 --> 01:38:11.166 line:82%
-These punks attacked me.
-They're leaving.

1979
01:38:11.233 --> 01:38:13.066 line:82%
The three of you are parents.

1980
01:38:13.133 --> 01:38:15.767 line:82%
-These punks attacked me.
-They're leaving.

1981
01:38:15.834 --> 01:38:17.233 line:82%
What? Are they civilians?

1982
01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:18.767 line:82%
You got it wrong.

1983
01:38:18.834 --> 01:38:20.200 line:82%
We're civilians.

1984
01:38:20.266 --> 01:38:22.266 line:82%
-Are they civilians?
-You got it wrong.

1985
01:38:22.333 --> 01:38:24.867 line:82%
-Hey, you got it wrong.
-Hurry up.

1986
01:38:24.934 --> 01:38:26.600 line:82%
Hey, Jung-ha.

1987
01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:28.967 line:82%
-Hurry up.
-You got it wrong.

1988
01:38:29.033 --> 01:38:30.033 line:82%
Let's go.

1989
01:38:32.667 --> 01:38:34.100 line:82%
Hey. I can't believe him.

1990
01:38:34.166 --> 01:38:35.467 line:82%
Hey, Jung-ha.

1991
01:38:36.166 --> 01:38:38.834 line:82%
JENNIE isn't a civilian. Hey. Jung-ha.

1992
01:38:41.133 --> 01:38:42.767 line:82%
It was me from the start.

1993
01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:44.500 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-Hurry up.

1994
01:38:44.567 --> 01:38:46.100 line:82%
-Come on.
-Please.

1995
01:38:46.166 --> 01:38:48.000 line:82%
JENNIE is the Seoul…

1996
01:38:48.066 --> 01:38:49.834 line:82%
-Come on.
-Please.

1997
01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:53.066 line:82%
JENNIE is the Seoul… Stop for a second.

1998
01:38:53.133 --> 01:38:54.934 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-We need to go.

1999
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.867 line:82%
-Hurry up, Jung-ha.
-Stop for a second. Hey, JENNIE…

2000
01:38:57.934 --> 01:38:59.200 line:82%
-Jung-ha, come on.
-Jung-ha.

2001
01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:01.767 line:82%
-Three people.
-Come here for a second.

2002
01:39:01.834 --> 01:39:03.800 line:82%
-I'm serious, Jung-ha.
-Come here.

2003
01:39:03.867 --> 01:39:06.000 line:82%
-JENNIE is the Seoul slicker.
-No.

2004
01:39:06.066 --> 01:39:08.667 line:82%
We need to go.
Jae-seok is the Seoul slicker.

2005
01:39:08.734 --> 01:39:11.333 line:82%
-I told you from the start.
-Hey.

2006
01:39:12.266 --> 01:39:14.700 line:82%
-Hey.
-We need to go.

2007
01:39:14.767 --> 01:39:16.266 line:82%
-Hey.
-Hurry up.

2008
01:39:16.333 --> 01:39:17.900 line:82%
Jung-ha, I need to do this.

2009
01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.000 line:82%
-Come here.
-We're a team…

2010
01:39:20.066 --> 01:39:21.066 line:82%
-JENNIE.
-…for a reason.

2011
01:39:21.567 --> 01:39:23.400 line:82%
JENNIE, come on.

2012
01:39:24.567 --> 01:39:25.834 line:82%
Wait.

2013
01:39:26.834 --> 01:39:29.567 line:82%
-The press conference hasn't begun.
-No, it hasn't.

2014
01:39:29.633 --> 01:39:30.834 line:82%
I want to check.

2015
01:39:31.867 --> 01:39:33.367 line:82%
Let's go.

2016
01:39:33.433 --> 01:39:34.900 line:82%
-Are you a civilian?
-Yes, I am.

2017
01:39:34.967 --> 01:39:37.433 line:82%
-I suspected Jae-seok from the start.
-Why?

2018
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.800 line:82%
I thought the parents were
Jae-seok and Na-ra.

2019
01:39:39.867 --> 01:39:41.100 line:82%
I'm certain.

2020
01:39:41.166 --> 01:39:43.567 line:82%
-Jae-seok, it's time to choose.
-Okay.

2021
01:39:43.633 --> 01:39:46.900 line:82%
-Jung-ha, hold my hand.
-Jung-ha.

2022
01:39:46.967 --> 01:39:49.066 line:82%
-JENNIE is the Seoul slicker.
-Jung-ha.

2023
01:39:50.066 --> 01:39:52.333 line:82%
Are the three of us parents?

2024
01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.767 line:82%
I don't know what Jae-seok is.

2025
01:39:54.834 --> 01:39:58.467 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-JENNIE is the Seoul slicker.

2026
01:39:58.533 --> 01:40:00.200 line:82%
I'll explain it from the start.

2027
01:40:00.266 --> 01:40:02.500 line:82%
Na-ra was a parent from the start.

2028
01:40:02.567 --> 01:40:05.400 line:82%
Whenever Na-ra did something suspicious,

2029
01:40:05.467 --> 01:40:07.200 line:82%
Jae-seok defended her

2030
01:40:07.266 --> 01:40:09.433 line:82%
so that we wouldn't suspect her.

2031
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.100 line:82%
-When she drank Oran-C…
-That's right.

2032
01:40:12.166 --> 01:40:14.467 line:82%
I was like, "Isn't that suspicious?"

2033
01:40:14.533 --> 01:40:17.700 line:82%
Jae-seok was like,
"I guess she was thirsty."

2034
01:40:17.767 --> 01:40:19.433 line:82%
-I'm going crazy.
-It made no sense.

2035
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.533 line:82%
Before Na-ra left,

2036
01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.500 line:82%
she downed this bottle.

2037
01:40:22.567 --> 01:40:24.567 line:82%
-Go on.
-It's a bit suspicious.

2038
01:40:24.633 --> 01:40:28.000 line:82%
-You're sharp.
-Yes. She suddenly chugged it.

2039
01:40:28.066 --> 01:40:30.867 line:82%
Maybe she was thirsty.

2040
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.667 line:82%
Is that strange?

2041
01:40:32.734 --> 01:40:34.700 line:82%
It's natural to drink a beverage.

2042
01:40:34.767 --> 01:40:38.233 line:82%
-The Oran-C makes me suspicious.
-Maybe she drank it without thinking.

2043
01:40:38.767 --> 01:40:41.700 line:82%
-Why are you covering for her? Hold on.
-Why are you covering for her?

2044
01:40:41.767 --> 01:40:45.100 line:82%
You're a parent who requested
illegal tutoring.

2045
01:40:45.166 --> 01:40:46.767 line:82%
I'm a civilian.

2046
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.934 line:82%
I'll check in on them. Come with me.

2047
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.066 line:82%
Okay.

2048
01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.500 line:82%
-JENNIE, what are you doing?
-What?

2049
01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:00.900 line:82%
What did you do?

2050
01:41:00.967 --> 01:41:02.934 line:82%
It was hot, so I wanted cold water.

2051
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.567 line:82%
-That was all it was, right?
-Yes.

2052
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.700 line:82%
Where are you going?

2053
01:41:09.767 --> 01:41:10.967 line:82%
To the room.

2054
01:41:11.033 --> 01:41:13.767 line:82%
Where is she going? Catch JENNIE.

2055
01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:15.600 line:82%
What's in this unit?

2056
01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.900 line:82%
JENNIE, what did you do alone earlier?

2057
01:41:17.967 --> 01:41:20.133 line:82%
-Nothing.
-Was there something?

2058
01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.834 line:82%
Don't suspect me, Jae-seok.

2059
01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:24.266 line:82%
-Come on.
-You…

2060
01:41:24.333 --> 01:41:26.934 line:82%
If I have a secret mission, it shows.

2061
01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:32.700 line:82%
Jung-ha.

2062
01:41:32.767 --> 01:41:35.233 line:82%
Seoul slicker. I'm from Seoul.

2063
01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:36.700 line:82%
-But…
-It's you.

2064
01:41:36.767 --> 01:41:38.533 line:82%
Jae-seok, I have a question.

2065
01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.033 line:82%
She's from New Zealand,
and you're from Seoul.

2066
01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:42.367 line:82%
Right.

2067
01:41:42.433 --> 01:41:46.166 line:82%
But JENNIE only studied in New Zealand.

2068
01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:47.667 line:82%
You're from Seoul, right?

2069
01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.333 line:82%
-Bundang.
-I got this.

2070
01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.100 line:82%
-Bundang.
-I got this.

2071
01:41:54.166 --> 01:41:55.867 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

2072
01:41:55.934 --> 01:41:57.333 line:82%
Jae-seok.

2073
01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:58.767 line:82%
-She's from Bundang?
-I don't know.

2074
01:41:58.834 --> 01:42:00.600 line:82%
Hey, but…

2075
01:42:00.667 --> 01:42:02.367 line:82%
Jae-seok, what's your identity?

2076
01:42:02.433 --> 01:42:06.400 line:82%
No, I'm… I'm a civilian.

2077
01:42:06.467 --> 01:42:07.967 line:82%
Let's have a press conference.

2078
01:42:08.033 --> 01:42:09.934 line:82%
-I'm a civilian.
-We'll go up.

2079
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.200 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-Jae-seok, be honest with us.

2080
01:42:12.266 --> 01:42:14.066 line:82%
-Tell us.
-I'm not a parent.

2081
01:42:14.133 --> 01:42:15.667 line:82%
That way, we can help you.

2082
01:42:15.734 --> 01:42:17.667 line:82%
I'm not a parent.

2083
01:42:17.734 --> 01:42:20.233 line:82%
-Don't fall for it.
-I'm not a parent.

2084
01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.800 line:82%
JENNIE, you're from Bundang?

2085
01:42:22.867 --> 01:42:23.800 line:82%
I'm from Bundang.

2086
01:42:23.867 --> 01:42:24.834 line:82%
Bundang?

2087
01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:26.266 line:82%
-Then it's you.
-It's so hard.

2088
01:42:26.333 --> 01:42:27.900 line:82%
Aren't you from Seoul?

2089
01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.333 line:82%
Jae-seok, I'm sorry. JENNIE, let's go.

2090
01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.233 line:82%
Bye.

2091
01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:37.533 line:82%
What's your identity?

2092
01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.266 line:82%
-Jae-seok, I'm sorry. JENNIE, let's go.
-Bye.

2093
01:42:39.333 --> 01:42:41.000 line:82%
What's your identity?

2094
01:42:41.066 --> 01:42:43.467 line:82%
I'm an innocent civilian.

2095
01:42:43.533 --> 01:42:46.433 line:82%
I'm here to expose illegal tutoring today.

2096
01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:47.533 line:82%
It's her.

2097
01:42:50.567 --> 01:42:51.567 line:82%
I'm…

2098
01:42:54.066 --> 01:42:55.066 line:82%
I'm…

2099
01:42:56.533 --> 01:42:57.800 line:82%
I'm…

2100
01:42:58.767 --> 01:43:00.066 line:82%
I'm…

2101
01:43:00.734 --> 01:43:03.433 line:82%
also an innocent civilian.

2102
01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.433 line:82%
Not. I'm a parent
who requested illegal tutoring.

2103
01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.633 line:82%
Not. I'm a parent
who requested illegal tutoring.

2104
01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:15.166 line:82%
Not. I'm a parent
who requested illegal tutoring.

2105
01:43:15.233 --> 01:43:16.500 line:82%
We won.

2106
01:43:16.567 --> 01:43:19.600 line:82%
This ledger is filled with lies.
It's nonsense.

2107
01:43:19.667 --> 01:43:22.700 line:82%
This ledger is filled with lies.
It's nonsense.

2108
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.633 line:82%
-We won.
-JENNIE.

2109
01:43:29.233 --> 01:43:32.100 line:82%
What's your hometown? Where are you from?

2110
01:43:32.166 --> 01:43:34.834 line:82%
-I'm from Seoul.
-Why did you say you were from Bundang?

2111
01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.533 line:82%
-JENNIE, well done.
-Hey.

2112
01:43:38.767 --> 01:43:42.033 line:82%
You're a parent
who requested illegal tutoring.

2113
01:43:43.533 --> 01:43:46.600 line:82%
If you don't drink four orange beverages,

2114
01:43:46.667 --> 01:43:49.333 line:82%
your identity will be revealed.

2115
01:43:55.133 --> 01:43:57.367 line:82%
-It's nothing.
-What?

2116
01:43:57.433 --> 01:44:00.166 line:82%
-It's nothing, right?
-There wasn't much information.

2117
01:44:00.233 --> 01:44:01.734 line:82%
I think…

2118
01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.367 line:82%
-Do you want some water?
-It's okay. I'll drink orange juice.

2119
01:44:11.367 --> 01:44:12.867 line:82%
-Come with me.
-Okay.

2120
01:44:18.867 --> 01:44:20.333 line:82%
JENNIE, what are you doing?

2121
01:44:25.433 --> 01:44:26.367 line:82%
All right.

2122
01:44:27.133 --> 01:44:29.900 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-To the room.

2123
01:44:29.967 --> 01:44:32.934 line:82%
Where is she going? Catch JENNIE.

2124
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.533 line:82%
What's in this unit?

2125
01:44:56.467 --> 01:44:58.734 line:82%
-Jae-seok, I'm sorry. JENNIE, let's go.
-Bye.

2126
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.266 line:82%
What's your identity?

2127
01:45:05.867 --> 01:45:08.300 line:82%
JENNIE, help us today.

2128
01:45:08.367 --> 01:45:10.033 line:82%
We're a team.

2129
01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:13.066 line:82%
Don't lie to me, okay? Seriously.

2130
01:45:13.133 --> 01:45:14.400 line:82%
Let's not do that.

2131
01:45:14.467 --> 01:45:15.567 line:82%
You can lie to me,

2132
01:45:15.633 --> 01:45:18.100 line:82%
but you'll have to deal
with the repercussions.

2133
01:45:21.066 --> 01:45:22.166 line:82%
Before Na-ra left,

2134
01:45:22.233 --> 01:45:24.767 line:82%
-she downed this bottle.
-Go on.

2135
01:45:24.834 --> 01:45:26.000 line:82%
It's a bit suspicious.

2136
01:45:26.066 --> 01:45:27.667 line:82%
-You're sharp.
-Yes.

2137
01:45:27.734 --> 01:45:29.000 line:82%
She suddenly chugged it.

2138
01:45:29.567 --> 01:45:31.033 line:82%
Maybe she was thirsty.

2139
01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:33.667 line:82%
-Why are you… Hold on.
-Why are you covering for her?

2140
01:45:33.734 --> 01:45:35.100 line:82%
-You're sharp.
-Right?

2141
01:45:35.166 --> 01:45:36.333 line:82%
-I had no idea.
-Hey.

2142
01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:39.100 line:82%
Isn't there any ice?

2143
01:45:41.367 --> 01:45:43.567 line:82%
I guess it doesn't have that function.

2144
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.300 line:82%
I can confidently say
that I'm one of the two.

2145
01:45:47.367 --> 01:45:49.233 line:82%
-I'm a civilian.
-I'm a civilian too.

2146
01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.367 line:82%
I really am a civilian.

2147
01:45:51.433 --> 01:45:54.000 line:82%
-Four?
-I really am.

2148
01:45:54.066 --> 01:45:55.734 line:82%
-It isn't me. Is it you?
-Come here.

2149
01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:56.800 line:82%
It isn't me.

2150
01:45:56.867 --> 01:45:58.600 line:82%
Except for us, everyone is a parent.

2151
01:45:58.667 --> 01:46:01.700 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-Except for us, everyone is a parent.

2152
01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.300 line:82%
Come to the press conference

2153
01:46:05.367 --> 01:46:07.934 line:82%
and reveal your identity.

2154
01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:12.734 line:82%
They're leaving.

2155
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.633 line:82%
-Hurry up. Let's go.
-JENNIE.

2156
01:46:18.834 --> 01:46:20.000 line:82%
-Hurry up.
-Jung-ha.

2157
01:46:20.667 --> 01:46:21.834 line:82%
-Come on.
-Please.

2158
01:46:26.266 --> 01:46:28.166 line:82%
I just realized it now.

2159
01:46:30.367 --> 01:46:32.967 line:82%
I just realized it now.

2160
01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:35.033 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

2161
01:46:37.066 --> 01:46:39.500 line:82%
Hey, you… My goodness.

2162
01:46:41.333 --> 01:46:43.100 line:82%
Is this a hidden camera prank?

2163
01:46:43.166 --> 01:46:45.166 line:82%
You're a civilian, right?

2164
01:46:45.233 --> 01:46:46.800 line:82%
What are you saying?

2165
01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:48.734 line:82%
-A hidden camera prank?
-Jung-ha, it's over.

2166
01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.767 line:82%
Where did that come from?

2167
01:46:50.834 --> 01:46:54.266 line:82%
He fell head over heels for JENNIE.

2168
01:46:54.333 --> 01:46:55.867 line:82%
JENNIE stayed close to him.

2169
01:46:55.934 --> 01:46:58.300 line:82%
He made a big impact today.

2170
01:46:58.367 --> 01:46:59.800 line:82%
-He really did.
-Bundang.

2171
01:46:59.867 --> 01:47:02.033 line:82%
Why did you say Bundang?

2172
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:05.467 line:82%
It was a nearby city that came to mind.

2173
01:47:05.533 --> 01:47:08.433 line:82%
-JENNIE doesn't disappoint. She's good.
-She's good.

2174
01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:09.834 line:82%
She's the Seoul slicker.

2175
01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:12.667 line:82%
Even I was confused.

2176
01:47:12.734 --> 01:47:15.200 line:82%
Did I mishear the mission?

2177
01:47:15.266 --> 01:47:17.834 line:82%
You're the master of the rooftop.

2178
01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:19.767 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-Every time he's here…

2179
01:47:19.834 --> 01:47:21.834 line:82%
I told you so.

2180
01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:24.767 line:82%
-The two of them look very…
-Seriously.

2181
01:47:24.834 --> 01:47:26.166 line:82%
They look like fools.

2182
01:47:26.233 --> 01:47:27.867 line:82%
-They look alike.
-A bit.

2183
01:47:29.533 --> 01:47:31.600 line:82%
…should no longer be tormented

2184
01:47:31.667 --> 01:47:35.100 line:82%
by the hellish entrance examinations
and excessive private tutoring.

2185
01:47:35.166 --> 01:47:38.633 line:82%
Attending academies during school breaks
will be allowed.

2186
01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:42.567 line:82%
Four instances of corruption on
college entrance exams have been exposed.

2187
01:47:42.633 --> 01:47:45.433 line:82%
