Have you ever read a novel
on the internet?

The popularity has now gone offline.

7
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.900 line:82%
After getting made into a movie,
it became a new genre.

8
00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.500 line:82%
The movies that are based on
internet novels are

They evoke fantasies among female fans.

Teenagers who like to set trends

became the target
of the new marketing strategy.

14
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.567 line:82%
Due to copycat consumption,
which involves blindly purchasing

15
00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.567 line:82%
what others have,

16
00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:16.700 line:82%
the number of teenagers
with bad credit is rising.

17
00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:19.867 line:82%
The need for money has led to crimes.

18
00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.900 line:82%
From theft and fraud

Did he flunk a few years?

32
00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:52.867 line:82%
Did he flunk three years?

33
00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:54.266 line:82%
About four years

34
00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:56.300 line:82%
-due to personal reasons.

35
00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:58.333 line:82%
-Your jacket is small.
-No, it's perfect.

36
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.700 line:82%
-Did you gain a lot of weight?
-No, I didn't.

37
00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:02.734 line:82%
I just prefer wearing tight clothes.

38
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.667 line:82%
I'm sorry, but we're high schoolers.
Why are you wearing rings?

39
00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.533 line:82%
Look at those rings.
Don't you know today's theme?

40
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.533 line:82%
One for friendship and one for love.

41

CHO ANNOUNCES HIS MARRIAGE

42
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.467 line:82%
This watch isn't for a high schooler.

43
00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:13.834 line:82%
I borrowed my mother's watch.

44
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.033 line:82%
He comes from a rich family.

45
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.066 line:82%
The backdrop is 2003.

46
00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:19.300 line:82%
It's 2003?

47
00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:21.400 line:82%
See? The North Face was trendy then.

48
00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.400 line:82%
You know, Se-chan isn't here.

49
00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:25.333 line:82%
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

50
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.333 line:82%
Do I immerse myself in the situation?

51
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.600 line:82%
I think it'll be fine
even if you keep still.

52
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.734 line:82%
I think it'll be fine

Sae-ho is like a peddler
in the world of variety shows.

55
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.867 line:82%
I brought many funny stories with me.

56
00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:43.233 line:82%
-Don't I need to share them?
-No.

57
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.967 line:82%
Inviting Sae-ho to fill in for Se-chan
was a cliché move.

58
00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:47.900 line:82%
To me, Jae-seok is
the father of variety shows.

59
00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:49.667 line:82%
Tae-hyun is the uncle of variety shows.

60

We aren't that close yet,
so I need some time.

62
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.500 line:82%
The in-law of variety shows.

63
00:03:58.567 --> 00:03:59.633 line:82%
There's still a wall.

64
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.934 line:82%
-The in-law of variety shows.
-Yes. The in-law.

65
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.433 line:82%
You're a substitute, so don't act up.

66
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.767 line:82%
A substitute.

67
00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:08.166 line:82%
I haven't heard that in a while.

68
00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:09.967 line:82%
Since it's your command, I'll follow.

69
00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.834 line:82%
The weather is cold today.

70
00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:20.033 line:82%
-You should've worn a jacket.
-I'm regretting my choices.

71
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.834 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Gosh, it's cold.

72
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.367 line:82%
Do you want to wear my jacket?

73
00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:26.133 line:82%
-No, thank you.
-Is it okay? All right.

74
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.934 line:82%
Don't wear it. It reeks of cologne.

75
00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:31.967 line:82%
It reeks of cologne.

76
00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:34.900 line:82%
No more perfume on you

77
00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:36.600 line:82%
-Isn't that it?
-That's right.

78
00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.967 line:82%
-There are students behind us.
-Students are coming.

79
00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:41.400 line:82%
They must be going to school.

80
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.266 line:82%
They're going to the same school.

81
00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.667 line:82%
This is fun. This is fascinating.

82
00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:47.300 line:82%

85
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.800 line:82%
-Hi.
-You guys look old too.

86
00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:55.266 line:82%
-I'm a bit sentimental.
-Okay.

87
00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:57.767 line:82%
I feel like I'm meeting my friends
on my way to school.

88
00:04:57.834 --> 00:04:59.667 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes, it's a strange feeling.

89
00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:00.834 line:82%
Gosh.

90
00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:02.300 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

91
00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:03.867 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes, it's a strange feeling.

92
00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:04.767 line:82%
Gosh.

93
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.633 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

94
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.033 line:82%
-What? That's…
-What?

95
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.500 line:82%
-What? That's…
-What?

96
00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:14.000 line:82%

-What?

107
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.266 line:82%
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

108
00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:44.800 line:82%
YEONJUN is handsome.

109
00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:48.633 line:82%
I don't have an ordinary face.

110
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.600 line:82%
You're handsome.

111
00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:53.567 line:82%
YEONJUN, you're a sight for sore eyes.

112
00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.533 line:82%
You look very cold.

113
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.533 line:82%
-Is he a student?
-No.

114
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.900 line:82%
He's a returning student.

115
00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:02.533 line:82%
-He's a middle-aged man.
-I mean…

116
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.700 line:82%
This isn't easy.

117
00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:04.734 line:82%
-He's a librarian.
-Really?

118
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.633 line:82%
I thought he was someone's uncle.

119
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.967 line:82%
He's good.

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.633 line:82%
It's Si-eun.

133
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.367 line:82%

Who's he?

142
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.300 line:82%
YEONJUN, your girlfriend is leaving.

143
00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:30.934 line:82%
Si-eun, wait for me.

144

Is he her boyfriend?

148
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.667 line:82%
Why are you running after her?

149

What was that?

150
00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:44.300 line:82%
Why are you running after her?

151

All right. The school gates

All right. The school gates

Is this an action school?

348
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.867 line:82%
An action school?

349
00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:00.700 line:82%

-You guys don't have one, right?
-Anycall.

YEONJUN left the classroom.

450
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.600 line:82%
Yesterday, there was
a disgraceful incident.

451

Yesterday, a jewelry shop near the school

452

Among them is an expensive item…

456

a teardrop necklace.

457
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.934 line:82%
We received a tip-off that the culprit is

458
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.567 line:82%
a student at this school.

459
00:21:38.633 --> 00:21:41.800 line:82%
So I want to give you an opportunity.

460
00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:43.667 line:82%
Everyone, close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

465
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.433 line:82%

467
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.367 line:82%

-Did you loaf around?

473
00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:12.333 line:82%
He took care of children.

474
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.934 line:82%
Aren't you a high schooler?

475
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.400 line:82%
-He has a nephew and a niece.
-Yes.

476
00:22:16.467 --> 00:22:18.600 line:82%
-Is this
Teenage Parent
?
-A nephew and a niece.

477
00:22:19.734 --> 00:22:23.100 line:82%
-
Teenage Parent
doesn't exist yet.
-Yes.

478
00:22:23.166 --> 00:22:24.500 line:82%
He's a wild child.

479
00:22:24.567 --> 00:22:26.233 line:82%
-Woo-il is on fire.
-Yes.

480
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.433 line:82%
-
Teenage Parent
was a good one. Sorry.
-Okay.

481
00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:30.800 line:82%
So you looked after children.

482
00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:32.734 line:82%
Cha Tae-hyun, what did you do yesterday?

483
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.533 line:82%
I watched a
Radio Star
episode
starring Im Woo-il yesterday.

484
00:22:37.266 --> 00:22:38.266 line:82%
Well done.

485
00:22:39.233 --> 00:22:40.633 line:82%
-Nice.
-Oh Na-ra, how about you?

486
00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.800 line:82%
It's gotten a lot of views.

487
00:22:41.867 --> 00:22:44.100 line:82%
-Na-ra, what did you do?
-I watched
Radio Star
too.

488
00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:46.266 line:82%
Im Woo-il only talked about JENNIE.

489
00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:48.000 line:82%
-That's right.
-So I was disappointed.

490
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.567 line:82%
-JENNIE, what did you do yesterday?
-Yes?

491
00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:53.033 line:82%
Me? I stayed at home.

492
00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:54.700 line:82%
What did you do at home?

493
00:22:54.767 --> 00:22:56.667 line:82%
-I read a book.
-I see.

494
00:22:56.734 --> 00:22:59.867 line:82%
-Which book?
-Why are you asking her so many questions?

495
00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:03.200 line:82%
-Are you interested in her?
-You asked her so many questions.

496
00:23:03.266 --> 00:23:05.300 line:82%
I did it in order to find the culprit.

497
00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:08.600 line:82%
-Sae-ho, what did you do yesterday?
-Yes?

498
00:23:08.667 --> 00:23:09.967 line:82%
I went on a date.

499
00:23:10.033 --> 00:23:10.867 line:82%
What?

500
00:23:10.934 --> 00:23:12.967 line:82%
-You're a high schooler.
-A date?

501
00:23:13.033 --> 00:23:15.066 line:82%
He has a serious girlfriend
he plans to marry.

502
00:23:15.133 --> 00:23:16.433 line:82%
Already?

503
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.767 line:82%
To be honest, I had a highball.

504
00:23:19.834 --> 00:23:21.533 line:82%
-Isn't that bad?
-A highball?

505
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.500 line:82%
Mr. Im.

506
00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.800 line:82%
-A high schooler drinking highballs?
-Are you insane?

507
00:23:24.867 --> 00:23:26.700 line:82%
Did you kiss your girlfriend yesterday?

508
00:23:26.767 --> 00:23:28.266 line:82%
Yesterday…

509
00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:30.934 line:82%
-Hey. "Yesterday"?
-"Yesterday"?

510
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.200 line:82%
Yesterday, we didn't get to kiss.

511
00:23:34.066 --> 00:23:36.400 line:82%
You drank a highball
but didn't kiss your girlfriend.

512
00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:41.000 line:82%
I think I saw a highball
in a movie yesterday.

513
00:23:41.066 --> 00:23:44.100 line:82%
-A student shouldn't drink highballs.
-No.

514
00:23:44.166 --> 00:23:45.367 line:82%
I got confused.

515
00:23:45.934 --> 00:23:49.266 line:82%
In any case, I gave you a chance.

516
00:23:49.333 --> 00:23:51.967 line:82%
Place your bag on your desk.

517
00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:54.500 line:82%
-But…
-Place it on your desk.

518
00:23:54.567 --> 00:23:57.633 line:82%
Place it on your desk.
Don't touch it further.

519
00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.967 line:82%
Si-eun.

520
00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:03.367 line:82%
All right, Si-eun.

521
00:24:11.967 --> 00:24:13.767 line:82%
-What's this?
-What?

522
00:24:13.834 --> 00:24:15.633 line:82%
-What's this?
-What?

523
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.633 line:82%
What's this teardrop necklace?
Why did it come out of your bag?

524
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.633 line:82%
It wasn't me.

525
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.133 line:82%
-You didn't steal it?
-It really wasn't me.

526
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.533 line:82%
-Don't play dumb.
-But…

527
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.500 line:82%
Should I keep quiet?

528
00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:29.767 line:82%
-What? Do you know something, Sae-ho?
-What?

529
00:24:29.834 --> 00:24:30.767 line:82%
Does Sae-ho know something?

530
00:24:30.834 --> 00:24:33.667 line:82%
-Say something.
-It came out of Si-eun's bag.

531
00:24:33.734 --> 00:24:34.867 line:82%
What is it?

532
00:24:34.934 --> 00:24:37.967 line:82%
-Spill. It's okay.
-Hurry up. I feel so victimized.

533
00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:39.333 line:82%
Cho Sae-ho, spill.

534
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.500 line:82%
-YEONJUN…
-Okay.

535
00:24:40.567 --> 00:24:44.767 line:82%
YEONJUN put something
in Si-eun's bag earlier.

536
00:24:44.834 --> 00:24:46.033 line:82%
Where's YEONJUN?

537
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.100 line:82%
-YEONJUN suddenly left.
-He left in a cool way.

538
00:24:48.166 --> 00:24:49.567 line:82%
-He left?
-He's cool.

539
00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:50.667 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

540
00:24:50.734 --> 00:24:53.633 line:82%
All right. Si-eun, follow me
to the teacher's office.

541
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.633 line:82%
-It wasn't Si-eun.
-She didn't do it.

542
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.400 line:82%
-Follow me.
-Si-eun.

543
00:24:57.967 --> 00:24:59.500 line:82%
-Follow me.
-Why?

544
00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:01.667 line:82%
I feel so victimized.

545
00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:04.600 line:82%
What's this teardrop necklace?
Why did it come out of your bag?

546
00:25:08.667 --> 00:25:11.600 line:82%
YEONJUN put something
in Si-eun's bag earlier.

547
00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:13.433 line:82%
-Oh, no.
-The main characters.

548
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.200 line:82%
-Why did you tattle?
-But I…

549
00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:19.633 line:82%
-What will you do if YEONJUN finds out?
-YEONJUN will beat you up.

550
00:25:20.266 --> 00:25:22.367 line:82%
Seriously, what's going on?

551
00:25:22.433 --> 00:25:24.934 line:82%
-Si-eun almost took the fall.
-Hey,

552
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.233 line:82%
-look.
-What's that?

553
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.500 line:82%
-What's that?
-What?

554
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:29.066 line:82%
-A photo.
-There's a photo.

555
00:25:30.834 --> 00:25:31.834 line:82%
We saw it earlier.

556
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.533 line:82%
-Right? We saw it earlier.
-A field trip photo.

557
00:25:40.867 --> 00:25:43.000 line:82%
It's a field trip photo. What's this?

558
00:25:43.066 --> 00:25:44.633 line:82%
Isn't that YEONJUN?

559
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.233 line:82%
Is YEONJUN in the photo?

560
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.633 line:82%
You know,

561
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.667 line:82%
judging by the photo,
it looks like the students are close.

562
00:25:52.533 --> 00:25:55.266 line:82%
This man. Who's this man?
Isn't he the one who dropped Si-eun off?

563
00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:56.667 line:82%
-That's right.
-Who? Where?

564
00:25:56.734 --> 00:25:57.867 line:82%
-The motorcycle.
-Earlier.

565
00:25:57.934 --> 00:25:59.400 line:82%
-The man in the back?
-The helmet.

566
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.100 line:82%
Who's he? He didn't seem like
a high schooler.

567
00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:10.533 line:82%
I know. Maybe he's…

568
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.900 line:82%
-He didn't come to school.
-He gave Si-eun a ride earlier.

569
00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:15.767 line:82%
-Is he a stalker?
-Who's he?

570
00:26:15.834 --> 00:26:16.934 line:82%
What?

571
00:26:18.033 --> 00:26:19.734 line:82%
Where did YEONJUN go?

572
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.533 line:82%
-We must find him.
-Shall we find him?

573
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.133 line:82%
-What?
-Where are you going?

574
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.867 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-So sudden.

575
00:26:25.934 --> 00:26:27.900 line:82%
-What about me?
-Hey.

576
00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:31.200 line:82%
-I feel so victimized.
-Of course, you do.

577
00:26:31.266 --> 00:26:32.200 line:82%
Of course.

578
00:26:32.266 --> 00:26:34.467 line:82%
The reason behind
the violent teenage crimes

579
00:26:34.533 --> 00:26:37.500 line:82%
was… much to everyone's shock.

580
00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:42.333 line:82%
-The period ended.
-It's break time.

581
00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:43.967 line:82%
Class President.

582
00:26:44.033 --> 00:26:45.066 line:82%
-Guys.
-Yes?

583
00:26:45.133 --> 00:26:49.133 line:82%
The superior and inferior classes
will be divided for the next period.

584
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.834 line:82%
The superior class will stay here,

585
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.767 line:82%
and the inferior class
will go to the library.

586
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.400 line:82%
Don't just sit there. Go.

587
00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:03.567 line:82%
-Are we in the inferior class?
-Really?

588
00:27:03.633 --> 00:27:05.800 line:82%
-Are we in the inferior class?
-Are we?

589
00:27:05.867 --> 00:27:08.500 line:82%
All of us? I see.

590
00:27:08.567 --> 00:27:11.433 line:82%
-All of us.
-See you later.

591
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.100 line:82%
Let's go to the inferior class.

592
00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:15.300 line:82%
-Yes. We need to go.
-We're in the inferior class.

593
00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:18.600 line:82%
It hurts my pride
that we're in the inferior class.

594
00:27:18.667 --> 00:27:20.233 line:82%
-I know.
-The inferior class.

595
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.500 line:82%
I'm okay with it.

596
00:27:23.333 --> 00:27:25.700 line:82%
My path has been decided.

597
00:27:26.467 --> 00:27:28.600 line:82%
I don't care which class I'm in.

598
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.500 line:82%
What do you want to be?

599
00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:33.233 line:82%
-What?
-What do you want to be?

600
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.200 line:82%
-I want to be a comedian.
-No comedian.

601
00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:36.834 line:82%
-I want to be a comedian.
-No comedian.

602
00:27:38.133 --> 00:27:39.433 line:82%
Don't be a comedian.

603
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.834 line:82%
I want to be a comedian, okay?

604
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.867 line:82%
The inferior class will take place
in the library.

605
00:27:43.934 --> 00:27:44.967 line:82%
LIBRARY

606
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.400 line:82%
My mom bought something for you guys.

607
00:27:50.467 --> 00:27:51.633 line:82%
Really?

608
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.333 line:82%
Ta-da. My mom bought fried chicken
for us to share.

609
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:58.467 line:82%
-
We're eating chicken at the library?
-
Ta-da.

610
00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:00.367 line:82%
-
Wow.
-
Yeah.

611
00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:01.900 line:82%
My mom bought it for us to share.

612
00:28:01.967 --> 00:28:03.934 line:82%
-
Thank you, ma'am.
-
Your mom?

613
00:28:04.734 --> 00:28:06.266 line:82%
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

614
00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:07.467 line:82%
Chicken.

615
00:28:07.533 --> 00:28:09.567 line:82%
-It's really tasty.
-My goodness.

616
00:28:10.367 --> 00:28:12.500 line:82%
It really suits my taste. Seriously.

617
00:28:15.133 --> 00:28:17.533 line:82%
-The boneless leg meat is tender.
-This one?

618
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.633 line:82%
-Really?
-It's incredible.

619
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.834 line:82%
It's tasty.

620
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.433 line:82%
It's spicy, tangy, and sweet.

621
00:28:25.266 --> 00:28:28.133 line:82%
What's the nature
of YEONJUN's relationship with Si-eun?

622
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.934 line:82%
If she's his girlfriend,
why would he slip her the necklace…

623
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.967 line:82%
-Seriously.
-…and back her into a corner?

624
00:28:34.033 --> 00:28:37.166 line:82%
-Right. She isn't his girlfriend.
-I think she's his crush.

625
00:28:37.233 --> 00:28:38.367 line:82%

They groomed the students
by giving them an allowance

908
00:41:53.867 --> 00:41:55.433 line:82%
and made them join…

909
00:42:00.133 --> 00:42:04.266 line:82%
The seniors made the others greet them.

910
00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:05.667 line:82%

913
00:42:12.233 --> 00:42:14.300 line:82%
For each school, they appointed a leader

914

and used them as…

915
00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:19.734 line:82%
They gave the students an allowance
and money for entertainment regularly.

916
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.266 line:82%
It's like a scouting process.

917
00:42:25.333 --> 00:42:26.734 line:82%
Since it looked cool…

918
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.967 line:82%

were forced to engage in
criminal activities to become members.

921
00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:41.166 line:82%

-Seriously.

934

Top dogs at the schools…

938
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.533 line:82%
-A dragon tattoo. Isn't that it?
-That's right.

939
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.133 line:82%

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.567 line:82%
If we study the rampant juvenile violence,

943
00:44:28.633 --> 00:44:32.767 line:82%
a tendency to imitate the violent scenes
in animated works and movies

944
00:44:32.834 --> 00:44:34.333 line:82%
can be clearly seen.

945
00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:40.033 line:82%
2003
WOOSANG GANGSTER HIGH SCHOOL

946
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.500 line:82%
The gangs that were dormant
for a short while

947
00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:44.734 line:82%
are growing
like poisonous mushrooms again.

948
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.166 line:82%
The fact that middle and high schoolers
are also in these gangs

949
00:44:48.233 --> 00:44:49.233 line:82%
has shocked the nation.

950
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.333 line:82%
Violent cliques in middle and high school

951
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.967 line:82%
were found to be the breeding ground
for gangsters,

952
00:44:54.033 --> 00:44:55.500 line:82%
much to everyone's shock.

953
00:44:55.567 --> 00:44:58.300 line:82%
The schools were raising
aspiring gangsters.

954
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.100 line:82%
Adult gangsters groomed the students

955
00:45:04.166 --> 00:45:05.967 line:82%
by giving them an allowance

956
00:45:06.033 --> 00:45:08.834 line:82%
and made them join the gang
upon graduation.

957
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.467 line:82%
Students who were deemed useful
due to their fighting skills and physique

958
00:45:12.533 --> 00:45:14.367 line:82%
were groomed since high school

959
00:45:14.433 --> 00:45:16.233 line:82%
with drinks and spending money.

960
00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.400 line:82%
Some members of the gang
were made to work as scouters.

961
00:45:24.433 --> 00:45:27.934 line:82%
The government has set out
to cut the schools' ties with the gangs.

962
00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:31.633 line:82%
-I think it's a gang.
-Yes.

963
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.166 line:82%
Top dogs at the schools…

964
00:45:34.133 --> 00:45:35.700 line:82%
They're after "A."

965
00:45:37.133 --> 00:45:39.934 line:82%
The police are after "A's" gang

966
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.834 line:82%
that is behind
the high school gang recruitment.

967
00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.300 line:82%
There was more.

968
00:45:53.367 --> 00:45:54.934 line:82%
There were strange symbols.

969
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.533 line:82%
-Chemical symbols.
-What does that mean?

970
00:45:58.533 --> 00:45:59.533 line:82%
It's Cl.

971
00:46:02.633 --> 00:46:05.433 line:82%
-I saw Cl.
-Cl is chlorine.

972
00:46:11.533 --> 00:46:14.200 line:82%
Perhaps we're here because of that reason.

973
00:46:14.767 --> 00:46:16.200 line:82%
-The biology lab.
-"Plus."

974
00:46:16.266 --> 00:46:17.834 line:82%
Let me see the videotape.

975
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.900 line:82%
WHERE: PLUS, B, CL, FINE DUST

976
00:46:25.834 --> 00:46:27.967 line:82%
I can't figure it out
no matter how much I look at it.

977
00:46:28.033 --> 00:46:30.033 line:82%
-B.
-B.

978
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.100 line:82%
-B, Pac-Man.
-B, Pac.

979
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.100 line:82%
CL.

980
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:35.467 line:82%
-CL.
-Yes.

981
00:46:35.533 --> 00:46:37.300 line:82%
-My goodness.
-What's B?

982
00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:39.166 line:82%
-What's B?
-B.

983
00:46:39.233 --> 00:46:41.967 line:82%
My goodness. Why is this boiling?

984
00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:44.433 line:82%
Shall we go to Grade One, Class Three?

985
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.633 line:82%
-Yes.
-What's Cl?

986
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.300 line:82%
Are there more clues here? There must be.

987
00:46:49.367 --> 00:46:52.700 line:82%
They might destroy the clues
we need to see.

988
00:47:05.266 --> 00:47:06.667 line:82%
Which way did they go?

989
00:47:06.734 --> 00:47:08.433 line:82%
-They went this way.
-Here?

990
00:47:11.567 --> 00:47:13.900 line:82%
The video player is here.
This must be where we watch it.

991
00:47:14.867 --> 00:47:16.433 line:82%
They took out the video.

992
00:47:18.166 --> 00:47:19.266 line:82%
You know,

993
00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:22.667 line:82%
there must be a gang in this school.

994
00:47:22.734 --> 00:47:24.433 line:82%
-It seems that way.
-Right.

995
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.967 line:82%
There's a gangster among us.

996
00:47:27.033 --> 00:47:28.767 line:82%
Is YEONJUN a gangster?

997
00:47:29.433 --> 00:47:31.200 line:82%
Is YEONJUN a gangster?

998
00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.367 line:82%
That's the plot of
My Boss, My Hero
.

999
00:47:37.934 --> 00:47:39.533 line:82%
He was the boss of a gang.

1000
00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:42.000 line:82%
Does that mean YEONJUN is

1001
00:47:42.066 --> 00:47:44.266 line:82%
-a gangster who enrolled in school?
-Maybe.

1002
00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:52.967 line:82%
Where's "A"?

1003
00:47:53.033 --> 00:47:55.367 line:82%
We need to solve the clue for "Where".
Grade One, Class Three.

1004
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.767 line:82%
Grade One, Class Three.

1005
00:48:07.834 --> 00:48:09.934 line:82%
What? Grade One, Class Three. Where?

1006
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.166 line:82%
Where? It's a location.

1007
00:48:12.233 --> 00:48:14.300 line:82%
A cross. The plus symbol is a cross.

1008
00:48:14.367 --> 00:48:17.433 line:82%
A cross. The plus symbol is a cross.
Jung-ha.

1009
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.533 line:82%
The plus symbol is a cross. Jung-ha.

1010
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.300 line:82%
-Jung-ha, a cross. B.
-I mean…

1011

-Jung-ha, a cross. B.
-I mean…

-What else was there, Jung-ha?
-B.

1014
00:48:29.834 --> 00:48:31.200 line:82%
Plus, B.

1015
00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:32.934 line:82%
-Jung-ha, a cross. B.
-I mean…

1016
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.467 line:82%
Is Grade One, Class Three
the answer to "where"?

1017
00:48:35.533 --> 00:48:39.166 line:82%
-Cl.
-Hey, erase it.

1018
00:48:42.867 --> 00:48:44.200 line:82%
-Excited about something?
-No.

1019
00:48:44.967 --> 00:48:46.033 line:82%

1026
00:49:08.066 --> 00:49:09.333 line:82%
Is that a Chinese character?

1027
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.367 line:82%
The one for "top."

1028
00:49:10.433 --> 00:49:12.900 line:82%
-Saturday.

1029
00:49:12.967 --> 00:49:14.633 line:82%

Dust.

Watch.

1049
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.600 line:82%
What does the face
after "fine dust" tell us?

1050
00:49:57.667 --> 00:49:59.367 line:82%
The face that comes after "fine dust."

1051
00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.266 line:82%

-It isn't bad.

1053
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.834 line:82%
-Good. Moderate.
-It means moderate.

1054
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.467 line:82%
If the fine dust level is moderate…

1055
00:50:09.033 --> 00:50:10.367 line:82%
Moderate.

1056
00:50:10.433 --> 00:50:12.467 line:82%
It's a homophone for "infirmary."

1057
00:50:12.533 --> 00:50:14.467 line:82%
Bed. A red cross.

1058
00:50:14.533 --> 00:50:16.367 line:82%
It means hospital.

1059
00:50:16.433 --> 00:50:17.533 line:82%

A cross. Let's go.

1065

Think of me as the brain of the team.

1071
00:51:06.467 --> 00:51:07.734 line:82%
You're the brain.

1072
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.967 line:82%
Of course.

1073
00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.333 line:82%
My school had it too.

1074

NURSE'S OFFICE

1075
00:51:12.834 --> 00:51:14.800 line:82%
-That's the nurse's office.
-There it is.

1076
00:51:15.934 --> 00:51:17.834 line:82%
The nurse's office. Go slowly.

1077
00:51:18.734 --> 00:51:20.033 line:82%
Let's slide in.

1078
00:51:22.333 --> 00:51:23.400 line:82%

Are you Gangster "A"?

1095

Are you Gangster "A"?

1096

What?

1099
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.700 line:82%
What?

1100
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.900 line:82%
I mean, YEONJUN…

1101
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.066 line:82%
Why did you put a necklace
in Si-eun's backpack?

1102
00:52:47.133 --> 00:52:48.066 line:82%
Why did you do that?

1103
00:52:48.133 --> 00:52:50.967 line:82%
Tell us honestly. We can help you.

1104
00:52:51.033 --> 00:52:53.200 line:82%
I stole the necklace.

1105
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.467 line:82%
Did you steal the necklace
because you wanted to be a gangster?

1106
00:53:02.333 --> 00:53:05.734 line:82%
I needed to do it to pass the test
and join the gang.

1107
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.967 line:82%
Meanwhile, adult gangsters
forced high school students

1108
00:53:10.033 --> 00:53:12.066 line:82%
to commit violent crimes

1109
00:53:12.133 --> 00:53:14.633 line:82%
under the guise of them
being a rite of passage.

1110
00:53:30.734 --> 00:53:32.400 line:82%
I stole the necklace. I'm sorry.

1111
00:53:32.934 --> 00:53:35.000 line:82%
-Someone made you do it.
-Right?

1112
00:53:35.066 --> 00:53:36.133 line:82%
Who was it?

1113
00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.967 line:82%
I can't tell you.

1114
00:53:39.033 --> 00:53:40.900 line:82%
-I really like TXT.
-Okay.

1115
00:53:40.967 --> 00:53:42.700 line:82%
-I really like TXT.
-Okay.

1116
00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:44.700 line:82%
Would you please tell me?

1117
00:53:46.734 --> 00:53:49.066 line:82%
-To be honest…
-Okay.

1118
00:53:49.133 --> 00:53:51.400 line:82%
-You watched the news, right?
-Yes.

1119
00:53:52.233 --> 00:53:55.166 line:82%
The police are after "A's" gang

1120
00:53:55.233 --> 00:53:58.100 line:82%
that is behind
the high school gang recruitment.

1121
00:53:59.066 --> 00:54:02.567 line:82%
-The one the police are after, "A"…
-Yeah?

1122
00:54:06.066 --> 00:54:07.667 line:82%
What?

1123
00:54:07.734 --> 00:54:08.900 line:82%
What?

1124
00:54:09.633 --> 00:54:11.233 line:82%
-What?
-What?

1125
00:54:13.033 --> 00:54:15.700 line:82%
JENNIE, Na-ra. Let's eat.

1126
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.166 line:82%
Woo-il, is this where we eat?

1127
00:54:18.233 --> 00:54:20.166 line:82%
Come on in.

1128
00:54:20.233 --> 00:54:21.967 line:82%
-I'll serve the food…
-Okay.

1129
00:54:22.033 --> 00:54:23.900 line:82%
-…when the rest of the team comes.
-Okay.

1130
00:54:23.967 --> 00:54:25.767 line:82%
The spoons and chopsticks are missing.

1131
00:54:25.834 --> 00:54:27.467 line:82%
They were inside.

1132
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.233 line:82%
Where's that one teammate of yours?

1133
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.834 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Na-ra.

1134
00:54:49.133 --> 00:54:51.166 line:82%
-Oh Na-ra.
-Yes?

1135
00:54:51.233 --> 00:54:53.467 line:82%
You don't listen, do you?

1136
00:54:53.533 --> 00:54:54.567 line:82%
Did you call me?

1137
00:54:54.633 --> 00:54:56.800 line:82%
-Let's eat.
-It's time for lunch.

1138
00:54:56.867 --> 00:54:58.233 line:82%
-Here.
-Does everyone get food?

1139
00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.500 line:82%
-Wipe your hands.
-Okay. Thank you.

1140
00:55:00.567 --> 00:55:04.300 line:82%
-The one the police are after, "A"…
-Yeah?

1141
00:55:07.934 --> 00:55:10.700 line:82%
It's Si-eun.

1142
00:55:10.767 --> 00:55:11.700 line:82%
What?

1143
00:55:11.767 --> 00:55:13.000 line:82%
-What?
-What?

1144
00:55:14.867 --> 00:55:18.900 line:82%
Si-eun is a scouter for the gang.

1145
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.533 line:82%
-You saw the man on the motorcycle.
-Yes.

1146
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.266 line:82%
-He's a scouter.
-Yes. He's a scouter too.

1147
00:55:29.233 --> 00:55:30.700 line:82%
I like you.

1148
00:55:33.233 --> 00:55:34.200 line:82%
It wasn't me.

1149
00:55:34.266 --> 00:55:35.433 line:82%
It wasn't me.

1150
00:55:39.567 --> 00:55:42.066 line:82%
It looks like the students are close.

1151
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.367 line:82%
Is it him or me?

1152
00:55:52.433 --> 00:55:54.266 line:82%
I like both of you guys.

1153
00:55:56.967 --> 00:55:58.266 line:82%
I like you.

1154
00:55:58.767 --> 00:56:00.767 line:82%
I like both of you guys.

1155
00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.867 line:82%
You're saying Si-eun is a scouter
who's a part of the gang.

1156
00:56:08.934 --> 00:56:11.734 line:82%
The police are after "A's" gang

1157
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.667 line:82%
that is behind
the high school gang recruitment.

1158
00:56:20.834 --> 00:56:22.300 line:82%
-It's a secret, but…
-Okay.

1159
00:56:22.367 --> 00:56:25.300 line:82%
-How were you led astray?
-Here's the important thing.

1160
00:56:25.367 --> 00:56:28.467 line:82%
-Here's the important thing.
-Sorry. I was too absorbed.

1161
00:56:28.533 --> 00:56:31.433 line:82%
Among the transfer students…

1162
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.500 line:82%
Okay.

1163
00:56:33.834 --> 00:56:35.233 line:82%
There are two scouters.

1164
00:56:35.734 --> 00:56:37.266 line:82%
There are two scouters.

1165
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.834 line:82%
Among the transfer students?

1166
00:56:41.367 --> 00:56:42.567 line:82%
I knew that'd be the case.

1167
00:56:43.567 --> 00:56:46.567 line:82%
Among the transfer students,
there are two scouters.

1168
00:56:46.633 --> 00:56:47.667 line:82%
Yes.

1169
00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:51.400 line:82%
The police are after "A's" gang

1170
00:56:51.467 --> 00:56:54.567 line:82%
that is behind
the high school gang recruitment.

1171
00:56:56.333 --> 00:57:00.900 line:82%
Scouters select and recruit students
for the gang.

1172
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.300 line:82%
Once they select the students,

1173
00:57:03.367 --> 00:57:05.633 line:82%
-they tell Si-eun.
-Si-eun?

1174
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.800 line:82%
Then Si-eun recruits them.

1175
00:57:08.433 --> 00:57:10.066 line:82%
I see. In that case,

1176
00:57:10.834 --> 00:57:11.967 line:82%
two transfer students

1177
00:57:12.033 --> 00:57:14.533 line:82%
must be carrying out
a secret mission for Si-eun.

1178
00:57:15.133 --> 00:57:16.400 line:82%
That's right.

1179
00:57:17.266 --> 00:57:18.700 line:82%
Right. They're doing it now.

1180
00:57:20.667 --> 00:57:22.200 line:82%
What do they do for Si-eun?

1181
00:57:27.233 --> 00:57:29.500 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Oh Na-ra.

1182
00:57:29.567 --> 00:57:30.800 line:82%
Yes?

1183
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.567 line:82%
The two of you are the scouters of a gang

1184
00:57:37.633 --> 00:57:41.700 line:82%
who infiltrated the school
in order to recruit gangsters.

1185
00:57:42.934 --> 00:57:45.633 line:82%
From now on, you'll…

1186
00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:52.100 line:82%
It's a very difficult mission.

1187
00:57:54.433 --> 00:57:57.834 line:82%
-Gosh, this is… Fish snack.
-My goodness.

1188
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.800 line:82%
Na-ra.

1189
00:58:14.867 --> 00:58:17.000 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Oh Na-ra.

1190
00:58:17.066 --> 00:58:18.066 line:82%
Yes?

1191
00:58:31.633 --> 00:58:34.900 line:82%
-There could be a scouter among us three.
-Yes.

1192
00:58:38.734 --> 00:58:40.934 line:82%
I don't know. You guys have to find them.

1193
00:58:41.633 --> 00:58:44.333 line:82%
-Okay. YEONJUN, see you later.
-Well done.

1194
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.633 line:82%
My niece likes you very much.

1195
00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.800 line:82%
You have a niece.

1196
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:51.867 line:82%
You're my friend's whole life.

1197
00:58:51.934 --> 00:58:54.400 line:82%
-All right. See you later.
-YEONJUN.

1198
00:58:54.467 --> 00:58:56.100 line:82%
-Don't get hurt.
-Thank you.

1199
00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:57.100 line:82%
We'll get going.

1200
00:58:59.066 --> 00:59:00.433 line:82%
Let's join the others.

1201
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.333 line:82%
-Let's go to the cafeteria.
-The cafeteria.

1202
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.500 line:82%
-Tae-hyun, it's not you.
-This is hard.

1203
00:59:04.567 --> 00:59:06.367 line:82%
It's not me either.

1204
00:59:06.433 --> 00:59:09.000 line:82%
Should we tell the others or not?

1205
00:59:11.166 --> 00:59:12.967 line:82%
I think we should do that.

1206
00:59:14.333 --> 00:59:16.367 line:82%
All right. Do you want us

1207
00:59:16.934 --> 00:59:19.066 line:82%
to share what we found out?

1208
00:59:19.567 --> 00:59:21.367 line:82%
Sure. Go ahead.

1209
00:59:22.433 --> 00:59:25.700 line:82%
There are spies among us.

1210
00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.600 line:82%
No way.

1211
00:59:35.834 --> 00:59:38.233 line:82%
Judging by the timing,

1212
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.300 line:82%
it'd make sense for Jae-seok
to do it last.

1213
00:59:41.367 --> 00:59:42.600 line:82%
No.

1214
00:59:42.667 --> 00:59:45.867 line:82%
His dependable supporter, Tae-hyun,
must be a spy too.

1215
00:59:45.934 --> 00:59:47.700 line:82%
The
Pinggyego
duo.

1216
00:59:51.767 --> 00:59:54.967 line:82%
Although it's Sae-ho's first visit,
he talks a lot.

1217
00:59:55.033 --> 00:59:57.200 line:82%
-He acts out.
-It's suspicious.

1218
00:59:58.633 --> 01:00:01.567 line:82%
-We tend to make deductions openly.
-That's right.

1219
01:00:01.633 --> 01:00:03.767 line:82%
We were whispering. Why did you eavesdrop?

1220
01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:05.500 line:82%
Did you hear us?

1221
01:00:05.567 --> 01:00:07.700 line:82%
-We were talking to ourselves, okay?
-Unbelievable.

1222
01:00:07.767 --> 01:00:10.867 line:82%
I don't know what game you're playing,
but it has nothing to do with me.

1223
01:00:11.367 --> 01:00:13.233 line:82%
I'm not playing a role.

1224
01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.066 line:82%
If you're holding back information,
I'll end you.

1225
01:00:16.133 --> 01:00:17.133 line:82%
Trust me.

1226
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.734 line:82%
How about a punch for 100 won?

1227
01:00:21.867 --> 01:00:24.834 line:82%
Na-ra and JENNIE, did you guys
get into fights when you were in school?

1228
01:00:25.533 --> 01:00:26.900 line:82%
I didn't fight at all.

1229
01:00:26.967 --> 01:00:27.967 line:82%
Me neither.

1230
01:00:28.533 --> 01:00:29.767 line:82%
Did you?

1231
01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:31.667 line:82%
Me? I never lost.

1232
01:00:33.166 --> 01:00:35.900 line:82%
-Because I never fought anyone.
-You never fought?

1233
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.400 line:82%
Where's Si-eun? Do we need to find her?

1234
01:00:53.834 --> 01:00:54.934 line:82%
Mr. Im is here.

1235
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.533 line:82%
Did you enjoy your lunch?

1236
01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.834 line:82%
-Yes.
-Yes, we did.

1237
01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:01.433 line:82%
-
Shall we leave for a game?
-
Shall we?

1238
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.667 line:82%
Let's go next door.

1239
01:01:02.734 --> 01:01:04.166 line:82%
-
Okay.
-
Next door.

1240
01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.500 line:82%
Your special activity for the day
is called

1241
01:01:07.567 --> 01:01:09.533 line:82%
-Bell Tag.
-What's that?

1242
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.266 line:82%
-Bell Tag.
-Bell Tag.

1243
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000 line:82%
-
The catchers will begin on this side.
-
Okay.

1244
01:01:15.066 --> 01:01:18.667 line:82%
The runners will begin in the corner
that's diagonal to the catchers.

1245
01:01:18.734 --> 01:01:22.166 line:82%
The representative catcher
will wear a blindfold.

1246
01:01:22.233 --> 01:01:25.166 line:82%
The key is the sound of the bell.

1247
01:01:28.567 --> 01:01:29.967 line:82%
Take three steps.

1248
01:01:30.033 --> 01:01:32.300 line:82%
One, two, three. Stop.

1249
01:01:34.934 --> 01:01:37.200 line:82%
Take large steps
toward your eleven o'clock.

1250
01:01:37.266 --> 01:01:39.600 line:82%
That's good. Keep going. One more step.

1251
01:01:42.467 --> 01:01:44.200 line:82%
If the bat touches you, you're out.

1252
01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:46.734 line:82%
Let's go again.

1253

Okay. Swing your bat.

1334
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.734 line:82%
Why-- My team is really bad at this.

1335
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.600 line:82%
Seriously. I can't get anyone.

1336
01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:44.367 line:82%
I mean…

1337

-Good.

1340
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.533 line:82%
The winning team.

1341
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.567 line:82%
The losing team will get this.

1342
01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:57.500 line:82%

Two spoons?

1347
01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.767 line:82%
Does it mean that there are two people?

1348
01:07:19.867 --> 01:07:21.467 line:82%
Among the transfer students…

1349
01:07:21.533 --> 01:07:23.033 line:82%
There are two scouters.

1350
01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.767 line:82%
What do the spoons mean?

1351
01:07:32.834 --> 01:07:35.667 line:82%
-Two spoons are the hint.
-What did we get?

1352
01:07:35.734 --> 01:07:38.000 line:82%
What do the two spoons mean?

1353
01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.300 line:82%
You don't think they symbolize
a gold or silver spoon, do you?

1354
01:07:41.867 --> 01:07:44.066 line:82%
The cafeteria? Rooms 103 and 102?

Here is a recording of a conversation

It isn't easy to do that.

1369

I told you to recruit
some transfer students.

1370
01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.266 line:82%
Who's that?

1371
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.333 line:82%
It isn't easy to do that.

1372
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.967 line:82%
Just bring
the transfer students' fingerprints then.

1373
01:08:59.767 --> 01:09:02.633 line:82%
We can put their thumbprints
on the application form.

1374
01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.133 line:82%

1376
01:09:12.533 --> 01:09:14.400 line:82%
hand over the fingerprints to Si-eun.

1377
01:09:14.467 --> 01:09:16.133 line:82%
Yes, Boss.

1378
01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.333 line:82%
-Si-eun.
-Si-eun?

1379
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.567 line:82%
From now on,

1380
01:09:22.633 --> 01:09:25.500 line:82%
you'll collect the members' fingerprints.

1381
01:09:25.567 --> 01:09:27.700 line:82%
…you'll collect the members' fingerprints.

1382
01:09:27.767 --> 01:09:30.834 line:82%
Between 5 to 5:10 p.m.,

1383
01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.834 line:82%
you must deliver them to Si-eun.

1384
01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.967 line:82%
Fingerprints?

1385
01:09:34.567 --> 01:09:36.767 line:82%
Bring the items

1386
01:09:36.834 --> 01:09:38.667 line:82%
to the biology lab

1387
01:09:38.734 --> 01:09:41.300 line:82%
and hand them over to the researcher.

1388
01:09:41.367 --> 01:09:43.367 line:82%
If the fingerprints can be collected

1389
01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:45.367 line:82%
from the item, it's a success.

1390
01:09:45.433 --> 01:09:47.633 line:82%
If they can't be collected,
it's a failure.

1391
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.400 line:82%
It's a very difficult mission.

1392
01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:04.667 line:82%
Na-ra.

1393
01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.233 line:82%

1396
01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.433 line:82%
You don't listen, do you?

1397
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:13.900 line:82%
Did you call me?

1398
01:10:33.367 --> 01:10:34.667 line:82%
-Si-eun.
-Si-eun?

1399
01:10:36.734 --> 01:10:37.667 line:82%
I see.

1400
01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:42.000 line:82%
I get it now. It seems like the spy
was collecting our fingerprints.

1401
01:10:42.066 --> 01:10:44.166 line:82%
…the spy was collecting our fingerprints.

1402
01:10:44.667 --> 01:10:47.533 line:82%
The police are looking
for the two scouters

1403

who collected
students' fingerprints illegally

1404
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.166 line:82%
and drew up false contracts.

1405
01:10:59.066 --> 01:11:01.000 line:82%
We need to find the two scouters.

1406
01:11:01.934 --> 01:11:05.867 line:82%
-Second locker, third-floor chemistry lab.
-All right.

1407
01:11:05.934 --> 01:11:08.433 line:82%
If you know the whereabouts
of the two scouters,

1408
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.200 line:82%
please report them

-Let's go.

1411
01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:25.300 line:82%
The chemistry lab.

1412
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.867 line:82%
Chemistry lab's second locker.

1413
01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:39.767 line:82%
The third-floor chemistry lab.

1414
01:11:39.834 --> 01:11:41.800 line:82%
CHECK OUT THE 2ND LOCKER
IN THE CHEM LAB ON THE 3RD FLOOR

1415
01:11:41.867 --> 01:11:44.533 line:82%
Let's go to the chemistry lab
on the third floor. Let's hurry.

1416
01:11:45.066 --> 01:11:46.867 line:82%
Chemistry lab's second locker.

1417
01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.066 line:82%
Chemistry lab's second locker.

1418
01:11:53.233 --> 01:11:55.233 line:82%
The second locker. This is it.

1419
01:11:57.533 --> 01:11:59.600 line:82%
The second locker. This is it.

1420
01:12:03.633 --> 01:12:05.200 line:82%
-What's inside?
-It's here.

1421
01:12:05.266 --> 01:12:06.567 line:82%
A notebook.

1422
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.633 line:82%
-My goodness.
-What is it?

1423
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.834 line:82%
-I bet there's a hint.
-What is it?

1424
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.767 line:82%
"The Gangster Code of Conduct."

1425
01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:22.133 line:82%
THE GANGSTER CODE OF CONDUCT

1426
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.667 line:82%
Since the violent cliques in the school
form ties with the gangs,

1427
01:12:25.734 --> 01:12:29.533 line:82%
the violence toward students
is becoming crueler by the day.

1428
01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.233 line:82%
The violent cliques make
a code of conduct

1429
01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.300 line:82%
and take revenge on members
who want to leave.

1430
01:12:35.367 --> 01:12:38.600 line:82%
They aren't much different from the gangs.

1431
01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.367 line:82%
"Bow at a 90-degree angle
when you greet someone."

1432
01:12:46.433 --> 01:12:48.333 line:82%
"Hug the gang members three times a day."

1433
01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.700 line:82%
"Shout out loud two times a day."

1434
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.900 line:82%
So the spies would do these things.

1435
01:12:53.967 --> 01:12:55.333 line:82%
-Hold on.
-They did already.

1436
01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.467 line:82%
I bet they already have.

1437
01:13:05.967 --> 01:13:07.233 line:82%
Did they speak out loud?

1438
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.233 line:82%
Hold on. A 90-degree bow?

1439
01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.834 line:82%
"Hug three times a day"?

1440
01:13:13.533 --> 01:13:15.734 line:82%
Who shouted when we first met?

1441
01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:20.667 line:82%
Since we got the code of conduct,
they'll avoid doing these actions.

1442
01:13:20.734 --> 01:13:22.000 line:82%
They'll continue to do them.

1443
01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:26.233 line:82%
Come on.

1444
01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.700 line:82%
Please.

1445
01:13:28.767 --> 01:13:30.700 line:82%
3. SHOUT OUT LOUD
TWO TIMES A DAY

1446
01:13:30.767 --> 01:13:31.834 line:82%
Okay.

1447
01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.633 line:82%
-YEONJUN, see you later.
-Okay.

1448
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.133 line:82%
2. HUG THE GANG MEMBERS
THREE TIMES A DAY

1449
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.533 line:82%
1. BOW AT A 90-DEGREE ANGLE
WHEN YOU GREET SOMEONE

1450
01:13:46.633 --> 01:13:48.667 line:82%
Hold on. A 90-degree bow?

1451
01:13:50.567 --> 01:13:52.467 line:82%
-The schoolyard.
-Hug three times a day?

1452
01:13:52.533 --> 01:13:53.767 line:82%
-The schoolyard.
-"Check out the schoolyard."

1453
01:13:53.834 --> 01:13:56.166 line:82%
WHERE: CHECK OUT THE SCHOOLYARD

1454
01:13:56.233 --> 01:13:57.367 line:82%
Let's go to the schoolyard.

1455
01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:59.867 line:82%
-Bow.
-Bow.

1456
01:14:01.066 --> 01:14:02.066 line:82%
Here it is.

1457
01:14:03.767 --> 01:14:04.900 line:82%
My goodness.

1458
01:14:04.967 --> 01:14:07.300 line:82%
-
What?
-
There's something. A notebook.

1459
01:14:11.767 --> 01:14:13.233 line:82%
Did anyone do these things?

1460
01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.667 line:82%
Hold on. Didn't people hug earlier?

1461
01:14:17.533 --> 01:14:18.533 line:82%
What?

1462
01:14:21.367 --> 01:14:22.367 line:82%
What?

1463
01:14:28.533 --> 01:14:29.867 line:82%
-Who is it?
-I figured it out.

1464
01:14:29.934 --> 01:14:31.467 line:82%
-What?
-Who is it?

1465
01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:32.500 line:82%
What?

1466
01:14:32.567 --> 01:14:34.333 line:82%
I'll go and check the schoolyard.

1467
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.834 line:82%
JENNIE, why are you leaving us
hanging? Hold on.

1468
01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.000 line:82%
I need to check the schoolyard.

1469
01:14:39.066 --> 01:14:40.500 line:82%
Let's check the schoolyard.

1470
01:14:40.567 --> 01:14:42.834 line:82%
Where should we go?
Can we see it from the classroom?

1471
01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.033 line:82%
Someone definitely hugged.

1472
01:14:45.867 --> 01:14:47.633 line:82%
I didn't hug anyone.

1473
01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.200 line:82%
-Someone hugged earlier.
-I didn't hug anyone.

1474
01:14:51.934 --> 01:14:53.233 line:82%
Where did the others go?

1475
01:14:55.033 --> 01:14:56.567 line:82%
Where did the others go?

1476
01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.900 line:82%
People hugged in front of me earlier.

1477
01:14:59.967 --> 01:15:01.166 line:82%
You know,

1478
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:02.900 line:82%
earlier…

1479
01:15:03.567 --> 01:15:06.367 line:82%
You know, earlier…

1480
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.133 line:82%
Earlier…

1481
01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.500 line:82%
-Sae-ho…
-Okay.

1482
01:15:13.567 --> 01:15:15.667 line:82%
-…and Na-ra hugged.
-Right?

1483
01:15:15.734 --> 01:15:16.633 line:82%
Yes.

1484
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.867 line:82%
-Sae-ho…
-Okay.

1485
01:15:18.934 --> 01:15:20.867 line:82%
-…and Na-ra hugged.
-Right?

1486
01:15:22.467 --> 01:15:24.934 line:82%
I've been a fan of hers for years.

1487
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.033 line:82%
-I love her.
-Go easy on us.

1488
01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.266 line:82%
2. HUG THE GANG MEMBERS
THREE TIMES A DAY

1489
01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:31.133 line:82%

1490
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.133 line:82%

get your hands off me.

1492
01:15:36.967 --> 01:15:38.900 line:82%
-…and Na-ra hugged.
-Right?

1493
01:15:40.467 --> 01:15:42.066 line:82%
-They…
-It was during a game.

1494
01:15:42.133 --> 01:15:43.300 line:82%
-During a game?
-Yes.

1495
01:15:44.867 --> 01:15:47.734 line:82%
Are the gangsters a team?

1496
01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:54.100 line:82%
-Where did Na-ra go?
-Where did she go?

1497
01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.533 line:82%
-Where did Na-ra go?
-Where did she go?

1498
01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.734 line:82%
Na-ra.

1499
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.767 line:82%
Oh Na-ra.

1500
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.333 line:82%
Give me the fingerprints.

1501
01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:16.567 line:82%
Give me the fingerprints.

1502
01:16:17.834 --> 01:16:19.166 line:82%
Give me the fingerprints.

1503
01:16:20.133 --> 01:16:21.533 line:82%
I'll take it out.

1504
01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:30.333 line:82%
Am I done?

1505
01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.066 line:82%
Just bring
the transfer students' fingerprints then.

1506
01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.967 line:82%
We can put their thumbprints
on the application form.

1507
01:16:43.467 --> 01:16:45.000 line:82%
Is anyone outside?

1508
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:47.934 line:82%
No?

1509
01:16:56.467 --> 01:16:59.200 line:82%
Si-eun. I don't know where Si-eun is.

1510
01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:00.867 line:82%
Is she in the schoolyard?

1511
01:17:00.934 --> 01:17:02.333 line:82%
Where is she?

1512
01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:04.967 line:82%
Si-eun!

1513
01:17:08.567 --> 01:17:10.500 line:82%
The schoolyard. Something is happening.

1514
01:17:11.266 --> 01:17:13.734 line:82%
They're playing soccer. I love soccer.

1515
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.734 line:82%
They're suddenly exercising.

1516
01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:19.767 line:82%
"Check out the schoolyard."

1517
01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:22.166 line:82%
"Check out the schoolyard."

1518
01:17:30.734 --> 01:17:32.300 line:82%
Is that Si-eun?

1519
01:17:34.467 --> 01:17:37.667 line:82%
Is that Si-eun? I can't see
because I have bad eyesight.

1520
01:17:38.533 --> 01:17:39.533 line:82%
Is that Si-eun?

1521
01:17:40.033 --> 01:17:41.700 line:82%
I don't think she's Si-eun.

1522
01:17:41.767 --> 01:17:44.567 line:82%
How frustrating. I can't see.

1523
01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.667 line:82%
Nice.

1524
01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:51.867 line:82%
What? Something's written on it.

1525
01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:53.600 line:82%
-What? Hold on.
-What?

1526
01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.133 line:82%
-Something's written on it. What? Hold on.
-What?

1527
01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.633 line:82%
-Something's written on it.
-What?

1528
01:18:03.266 --> 01:18:05.934 line:82%
Something's written on it.

1529
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.133 line:82%
-Why did you kick it?
-Something's written on it.

1530
01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.500 line:82%
Saeng.

1531
01:18:18.233 --> 01:18:19.934 line:82%
Pass. Thank you.

1532
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.734 line:82%
Hak.

1533
01:18:23.734 --> 01:18:25.900 line:82%
My goodness. I figured it out.

1534
01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:28.433 line:82%
Tae-hyun, hurry.

1535
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.667 line:82%
What? What is it?

1536
01:18:32.433 --> 01:18:34.400 line:82%
I saw the letters.
They made "Student Union."

1537
01:18:34.467 --> 01:18:35.800 line:82%
Student Union.

1538
01:18:35.867 --> 01:18:37.266 line:82%
-What's that?
-
Gwan.

1539
01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:39.300 line:82%
-Student Union Building.
-That's right.

1540
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.433 line:82%
-It was on the soccer balls.
-Student Union Building.

1541
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.934 line:82%
Student Union Building.

1542
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.667 line:82%
It's right there.

1543
01:18:46.734 --> 01:18:47.967 line:82%
-There.
-There it is.

1544
01:18:50.233 --> 01:18:52.066 line:82%
STUDENT UNION BUILDING

1545
01:18:52.133 --> 01:18:54.300 line:82%
Sae-ho, I don't think you're a spy.

1546
01:18:54.367 --> 01:18:55.867 line:82%
-I'm not a spy.
-Right.

1547
01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:59.100 line:82%
The code of conduct

1548
01:18:59.166 --> 01:19:00.400 line:82%
we found…

1549
01:19:00.467 --> 01:19:01.433 line:82%
Oh, my God.

1550
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.467 line:82%
The code of conduct we found…

1551
01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.033 line:82%
Oh, my God.

1552
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.100 line:82%
-What?
-Fill it out.

1553
01:19:10.033 --> 01:19:11.767 line:82%
Violent cliques in middle and high school

1554
01:19:11.834 --> 01:19:14.266 line:82%
were found to be the breeding ground
for gangsters,

1555
01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.000 line:82%
much to everyone's shock.

1556
01:19:16.066 --> 01:19:19.567 line:82%
Gangsters managed
the violent cliques in high schools

1557
01:19:19.633 --> 01:19:22.600 line:82%
and lured students into the gang.

1558
01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.033 line:82%
-What?
-It's scary.

1559
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.700 line:82%
Hey.

1560
01:19:36.767 --> 01:19:38.533 line:82%
-YEONJUN.
-Hey.

1561
01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:41.033 line:82%
What are you doing? Don't join the gang.

1562
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.400 line:82%
Hurry up and fill it out.

1563
01:19:42.467 --> 01:19:44.033 line:82%
Don't do it, YEONJUN.

1564
01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.066 line:82%
-Stop.
-I'm going to be a gangster.

1565
01:19:46.133 --> 01:19:47.533 line:82%
I'll become stronger.

1566
01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.166 line:82%
-Are these our application forms?
-Yes.

1567
01:19:50.233 --> 01:19:52.266 line:82%
-Are these our application forms?
-Yes.

1568
01:19:52.333 --> 01:19:54.500 line:82%
Our filled-out application forms are here.

1569
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:58.033 line:82%
-But I never filled one out.
-Me neither.

1570
01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.066 line:82%
Bike Gang.

1571
01:19:59.133 --> 01:20:00.300 line:82%
Bike Gang.

1572
01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:06.533 line:82%
Si-eun, what are you doing here?

1573
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.100 line:82%
Do I still look like your friend?

1574
01:20:10.166 --> 01:20:11.967 line:82%
-You're a gangster.
-What?

1575
01:20:12.033 --> 01:20:13.300 line:82%
-So scary.
-You're a gangster.

1576
01:20:13.367 --> 01:20:14.367 line:82%
It's so scary.

1577
01:20:14.433 --> 01:20:17.867 line:82%
What are we supposed to do?
Are we supposed to join the gang?

1578
01:20:17.934 --> 01:20:20.900 line:82%
YEONJUN, you shouldn't do that.

1579
01:20:20.967 --> 01:20:22.467 line:82%
Don't try to stop me.

1580
01:20:22.533 --> 01:20:24.433 line:82%
I don't know what's going on.

1581
01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.200 line:82%
-Maybe I should just join.
-Tae-hyun.

1582
01:20:26.266 --> 01:20:27.667 line:82%
He's a spy.

1583
01:20:27.734 --> 01:20:29.367 line:82%
-Maybe I should just join.
-Tae-hyun.

1584
01:20:29.433 --> 01:20:31.000 line:82%
He's a spy.

1585
01:20:31.767 --> 01:20:32.667 line:82%
Why would you join?

1586
01:20:32.734 --> 01:20:34.800 line:82%
Maybe I should join the gang.

1587
01:20:34.867 --> 01:20:36.533 line:82%
-Do you want to join?
-No.

1588
01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.834 line:82%
Tae-hyun and Na-ra are the spies.

1589
01:20:39.934 --> 01:20:41.734 line:82%
Tae-hyun and Na-ra are the spies.

1590
01:20:44.467 --> 01:20:48.033 line:82%
There were a dragon and a tiger.

1591
01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.800 line:82%
Tae-hyun's sign is the dragon,
Na-ra's sign is the tiger.

1592
01:20:52.834 --> 01:20:55.667 line:82%
Tae-hyun's sign is the dragon,
Na-ra's sign is the tiger.

1593
01:20:58.033 --> 01:20:58.967 line:82%
-You're right.
-Right?

1594
01:20:59.033 --> 01:21:03.233 line:82%
His sign is the dragon.
And when we met this morning…

1595
01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.767 line:82%
-Come to think of it…
-That's right.

1596
01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:07.567 line:82%
…he was being filmed
with a cell phone camera.

1597
01:21:08.333 --> 01:21:09.767 line:82%
…with a cell phone camera.

1598
01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:12.500 line:82%
Tae-hyun is a spy.

1599
01:21:13.867 --> 01:21:15.800 line:82%
I noticed something about Na-ra too.

1600
01:21:15.867 --> 01:21:16.934 line:82%
-Someone is here.
-What?

1601
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.367 line:82%
-We found them.
-Yes.

1602
01:21:18.433 --> 01:21:19.867 line:82%
-Na-ra and Tae-hyun.
-We found them.

1603
01:21:19.934 --> 01:21:21.133 line:82%
-We found them.
-Yes.

1604
01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.767 line:82%
-Na-ra and Tae-hyun.
-We found them.

1605
01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:24.100 line:82%
Na-ra and Tae-hyun.

1606
01:21:24.166 --> 01:21:25.467 line:82%
Me and Tae-hyun?

1607
01:21:25.533 --> 01:21:27.200 line:82%
-Na-ra and Tae-hyun. I know.
-Why me?

1608
01:21:27.266 --> 01:21:28.800 line:82%
-How do you know?
-It's them.

1609
01:21:28.867 --> 01:21:31.033 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1610
01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:32.800 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-He talks a lot,

1611
01:21:32.867 --> 01:21:33.967 line:82%
-right?
-Yes.

1612
01:21:34.033 --> 01:21:36.900 line:82%
Who could the scouters be?

1613
01:21:38.433 --> 01:21:40.133 line:82%
-Tell me what you know.
-What?

1614
01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.166 line:82%
Did you read the notebook?

1615
01:21:42.233 --> 01:21:43.700 line:82%
-Yes.
-I saw that.

1616
01:21:43.767 --> 01:21:45.600 line:82%
-The hug.
-During the game…

1617
01:21:46.533 --> 01:21:47.667 line:82%
Isn't that it?

1618
01:21:48.767 --> 01:21:49.767 line:82%
Yes, it is.

1619
01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.200 line:82%
I saw people do this.

1620
01:21:54.266 --> 01:21:55.734 line:82%
-Na-ra?
-Yes.

1621
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.000 line:82%
Isn't Sae-ho also a scouter?

1622
01:21:58.066 --> 01:21:59.333 line:82%
Let me read it.

1623
01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.333 line:82%
I saw them do this twice.

1624
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.367 line:82%
-This one.
-Who?

1625
01:22:04.934 --> 01:22:08.500 line:82%
That's why I'm not saying anything
right now.

1626
01:22:08.567 --> 01:22:10.367 line:82%
I know that it's him.

1627
01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:33.266 line:82%
Dear students, this is an announcement.

1628
01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:37.433 line:82%
From now on, the scouters can hand over

1629
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.633 line:82%
the collected fingerprints.

1630
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.133 line:82%
When did they get our fingerprints?

1631
01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.133 line:82%
If the collected fingerprints
get delivered to Si-eun

1632
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.567 line:82%
by 5:10 p.m., Team Scouters will win.

1633
01:22:49.633 --> 01:22:53.900 line:82%
If they fail,
Team Transfer Students will win.

1634
01:22:53.967 --> 01:22:58.166 line:82%
Both teams, I ask you to do your best
until the very end.

1635
01:22:59.533 --> 01:23:01.266 line:82%
Si-eun is over there.

1636
01:23:01.333 --> 01:23:02.767 line:82%
-We found her.
-Si-eun.

1637
01:23:02.834 --> 01:23:04.400 line:82%
-Stop her.
-Tae-hyun is going closer.

1638
01:23:04.467 --> 01:23:06.433 line:82%
Stop Si-eun.

1639
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.600 line:82%
Tae-hyun is going closer.

1640
01:23:10.967 --> 01:23:13.734 line:82%
-Si-eun.
-Hold on.

1641
01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.834 line:82%
-Si-eun.
-Hold on.

1642
01:23:16.367 --> 01:23:17.734 line:82%
Sae-ho is going closer.

1643
01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.266 line:82%
-Hold on.
-I mean…

1644
01:23:19.333 --> 01:23:20.467 line:82%
-Come here.
-Listen.

1645
01:23:20.533 --> 01:23:22.567 line:82%
It isn't me. In my opinion…

1646
01:23:22.633 --> 01:23:23.900 line:82%
Sae-ho, step away from her.

1647
01:23:23.967 --> 01:23:26.233 line:82%
-Jung-ha, don't you trust me?
-I don't.

1648
01:23:26.934 --> 01:23:28.700 line:82%
-Don't you trust me?
-I don't.

1649
01:23:28.767 --> 01:23:30.433 line:82%
-Wipe your snot.
-Snot?

1650
01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.166 line:82%
-Are you getting a fingerprint?
-No.

1651
01:23:32.233 --> 01:23:33.400 line:82%
What?

1652
01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:34.800 line:82%
You did this.

1653
01:23:35.367 --> 01:23:38.033 line:82%
I'm very suspicious of Tae-hyun today.
It's him, right?

1654
01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.000 line:82%
The dragon and tiger signs.

1655
01:23:40.066 --> 01:23:42.000 line:82%
I'd appreciate it if you could come here.

1656
01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.100 line:82%
I'm blocking the path
so that no one gets to Si-eun.

1657
01:23:46.734 --> 01:23:48.834 line:82%
-Come here. Don't stand there.
-Seriously.

1658
01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.000 line:82%
-Don't stand next to Si-eun.
-No.

1659
01:23:51.066 --> 01:23:53.700 line:82%
-Come here.
-I'm blocking the path.

1660
01:23:53.767 --> 01:23:56.400 line:82%
-Come here.
-I'm blocking the path.

1661
01:23:56.467 --> 01:23:58.900 line:82%
-We need to block it.
-Why did you guys come so close?

1662
01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:01.100 line:82%
-It really isn't me.
-I mean…

1663
01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:03.700 line:82%
It really isn't me.

1664
01:24:04.233 --> 01:24:05.500 line:82%
-Come on out.
-Who is it?

1665
01:24:05.567 --> 01:24:07.533 line:82%
If time runs out,
the transfer students win.

1666
01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.734 line:82%
-Okay.
-Block the path.

1667
01:24:10.834 --> 01:24:12.967 line:82%
-Okay.
-Block the path.

1668
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.600 line:82%
-Okay.
-Block the path.

1669
01:24:20.367 --> 01:24:23.900 line:82%
All right. Let's start.

1670
01:24:23.967 --> 01:24:25.600 line:82%
-Who are they?
-Let's win.

1671
01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:27.000 line:82%
Who are the scouters?

1672
01:24:27.767 --> 01:24:30.000 line:82%
-Who are they? Who are the scouters?
-Let's win.

1673
01:24:32.633 --> 01:24:34.033 line:82%
-Tae-hyun.
-It isn't me.

1674
01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.433 line:82%
-Who are they? Who are the scouters?
-Let's win.

1675
01:24:43.166 --> 01:24:45.033 line:82%
-Tae-hyun.
-It isn't me.

1676
01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.133 line:82%
Si-eun!

1677
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.867 line:82%
-What?
-Here!

1678
01:24:47.934 --> 01:24:49.300 line:82%
Si-eun!

1679
01:24:49.367 --> 01:24:50.834 line:82%
-What?
-Here!

1680
01:24:52.834 --> 01:24:53.834 line:82%
What?

1681
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.734 line:82%
-What?
-Here!

1682
01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.333 line:82%
-Si-eun!
-What?

1683
01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:08.633 line:82%
-Si-eun!
-What?

1684
01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.567 line:82%
-Si-eun!
-What?

1685
01:25:11.633 --> 01:25:12.667 line:82%
Hurry up.

1686
01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:14.867 line:82%
-Si-eun!
-What?

1687
01:25:14.934 --> 01:25:18.900 line:82%
-Si-eun!
-Hurry!

1688
01:25:18.967 --> 01:25:21.000 line:82%
-Hurry!
-Si-eun!

1689
01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.633 line:82%
-Si-eun.
-Why is Si-eun so strong?

1690
01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.500 line:82%
-Why are you so strong?
-Si-eun!

1691
01:25:42.133 --> 01:25:44.100 line:82%
-Where are they?
-Hey.

1692
01:25:44.166 --> 01:25:45.734 line:82%
Si-eun, no. Protect them.

1693
01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:50.133 line:82%
Si-eun, no. Protect them.

1694
01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.834 line:82%
-Protect them.
-Okay.

1695
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.400 line:82%
-Si-eun.
-I got them!

1696
01:26:02.533 --> 01:26:04.767 line:82%
-Si-eun.
-I got them!

1697
01:26:07.667 --> 01:26:09.367 line:82%
Well done, Si-eun.

1698
01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.600 line:82%
Well done, Si-eun.

1699
01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:20.967 line:82%
-Was it JENNIE?
-We won.

1700
01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.900 line:82%
-Was it JENNIE?
-Si-eun.

1701
01:26:29.066 --> 01:26:31.834 line:82%
The two of you are the scouters of a gang.

1702
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.600 line:82%
-What?
-What?

1703
01:26:33.667 --> 01:26:36.233 line:82%
We're in school uniforms.
That's unbelievable.

1704
01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:38.867 line:82%
-So we're spies.
-We're spies.

1705
01:26:38.934 --> 01:26:40.533 line:82%
We must win today.

1706
01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.667 line:82%
-How exciting.
-From now on,

1707
01:26:42.734 --> 01:26:45.300 line:82%
you'll collect the members' fingerprints

1708
01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:48.066 line:82%
and deliver them to Si-eun.

1709
01:26:48.667 --> 01:26:49.800 line:82%
-Fingerprints.
-Fingerprints.

1710
01:26:52.133 --> 01:26:53.600 line:82%
Here.

1711
01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.600 line:82%
It'll have fingerprints.

1712
01:26:56.266 --> 01:26:57.767 line:82%
It's my first time winning.

1713
01:27:01.266 --> 01:27:03.967 line:82%
Mr. Researcher, do I just give it to you?

1714
01:27:18.467 --> 01:27:20.967 line:82%
This is for Cha Tae-hyun,
and this is for Cho Sae-ho.

1715
01:27:26.266 --> 01:27:30.233 line:82%
Also, there's another mission
other than the one about the fingerprints.

1716
01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:31.233 line:82%
It sounds fun.

1717
01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.333 line:82%
JENNIE, can you shout out loud?

1718
01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:34.400 line:82%
No.

1719
01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.266 line:82%
-We're in trouble.
-I'll give it a go.

1720
01:27:39.066 --> 01:27:41.133 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1721
01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.533 line:82%
-Mr. Im, thank you.
-Thank you.

1722
01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.767 line:82%
1. BOW AT A 90-DEGREE ANGLE
WHEN YOU GREET SOMEONE

1723
01:27:47.834 --> 01:27:49.667 line:82%
It was so frustrating.

1724
01:27:49.734 --> 01:27:52.100 line:82%
-You're the best.
-Why…

1725
01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:53.500 line:82%
You're so good.

1726
01:27:53.567 --> 01:27:55.667 line:82%
We did it. We did it.

1727
01:27:55.734 --> 01:27:57.767 line:82%
2. HUG THE GANG MEMBERS
THREE TIMES A DAY

1728
01:27:57.834 --> 01:27:58.967 line:82%
Why?

1729
01:28:00.266 --> 01:28:02.033 line:82%
-Go first.
-Go first, okay?

1730
01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.533 line:82%
3. SHOUT OUT LOUD TWO TIMES A DAY

1731
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.100 line:82%
Oh, no. We'll be late!

1732
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.500 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1733
01:28:09.567 --> 01:28:11.133 line:82%
-Okay.
-Get ready.

1734
01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.767 line:82%
Where's Si-eun?

1735
01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.000 line:82%
First floor.

1736
01:28:19.066 --> 01:28:21.133 line:82%
-Did we collect them all?
-Yes.

1737
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.266 line:82%
We need to find Si-eun.

1738
01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:24.333 line:82%
JENNIE, I'm being suspected.

1739
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.934 line:82%
You should use me.

1740
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.000 line:82%
-Don't move.
-You shouldn't do that.

1741
01:28:34.066 --> 01:28:36.200 line:82%
-I love her.
-Go easy on us.

1742
01:28:36.266 --> 01:28:37.900 line:82%
-I…
-Go easy on us.

1743
01:28:37.967 --> 01:28:39.767 line:82%
-Sae-ho…
-Okay.

1744
01:28:39.834 --> 01:28:41.934 line:82%
-…and Na-ra hugged.
-Right?

1745
01:28:43.166 --> 01:28:46.200 line:82%
-Na-ra?
-Yes. Isn't Sae-ho also a scouter?

1746
01:28:46.266 --> 01:28:48.367 line:82%
I saw them do this twice.

1747
01:28:48.433 --> 01:28:50.533 line:82%
-Na-ra and Sae-ho?
-Yes.

1748
01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:53.533 line:82%
All right.

1749
01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.633 line:82%
JENNIE.

1750
01:28:56.266 --> 01:28:57.266 line:82%
Okay.

1751
01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.867 line:82%
I…

1752
01:29:17.166 --> 01:29:19.066 line:82%
Gosh, I'm so disappointed.

1753
01:29:19.133 --> 01:29:20.967 line:82%
-Is the shoot over?
-Yes.

1754
01:29:21.033 --> 01:29:22.433 line:82%
I feel like there should be more.

1755
01:29:23.166 --> 01:29:25.633 line:82%
Let's give brief greetings
to wrap up Season One.

1756
01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:26.633 line:82%
Jung-ha.

1757
01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:29.033 line:82%
I was clumsy at first.
But if there's a Season Two,

1758
01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:32.266 line:82%
I'll become the brain of the show
and solve cases diligently.

1759
01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:33.233 line:82%
Thank you.

1760
01:29:38.367 --> 01:29:41.166 line:82%
What should I do to make good deductions?

1761
01:29:41.233 --> 01:29:42.934 line:82%
Please leave comments.

1762
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.667 line:82%
I'm frustrated with myself.

1763
01:29:45.767 --> 01:29:48.333 line:82%
Oh Na-ra's brain is evolving.

1764
01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:52.100 line:82%
-
I'm confident in solving all mysteries.
-
She's suddenly bragging.

1765
01:29:52.166 --> 01:29:55.233 line:82%
She says that
just because she got it right once.

1766
01:30:01.467 --> 01:30:04.266 line:82%
I felt like I was here to play.
It was so much fun.

1767
01:30:04.333 --> 01:30:08.533 line:82%
I'm happy that I made a new family.

1768
01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.367 line:82%
I hope this won't be
our last time together.

1769
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.600 line:82%
-
I'll pray with desperation.
-
There should be more.

1770
01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:20.800 line:82%
Thank you very much
for watching
Apartment404.

1771
01:30:20.867 --> 01:30:22.100 line:82%
-
Thank you.

Thank you.

1772
01:30:22.166 --> 01:30:24.000 line:82%
-
Thank you.

Thank you.

1773
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.834 line:82%

Thank you.
