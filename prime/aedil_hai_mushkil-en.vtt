00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.980 line:82%
Mic check.

2
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.930 line:82%
Sounds good... Checking focus.

3
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.290 line:82%
Roll sound!

4
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.320 line:82%
Ready, Ayan?

5
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.650 line:82%
Yeah.

6
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.170 line:82%
Great... Let's start!

7
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.220 line:82%
So... The reclusive Ayan Sanger!

8
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.650 line:82%
5 years... 4 big songs...

9
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.160 line:82%
all hits and all non-film!
Congratulations!

10
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.870 line:82%
Thanks... and thanks to all of you.

11
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.950 line:82%
The lyrics of your
songs are by a certain

12
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.750 line:82%
Saba Taliyar Khan,

13
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.830 line:82%
and she's a lesser
known poet, right?

14
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.890 line:82%
We had a very special relationship...

15
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.940 line:82%
Past tense! And now?

16
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.950 line:82%
She's a really good friend.

17
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.650 line:82%
And all your songs hint at
unrequited loved... Does that mean...

18
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.700 line:82%
No, no, no...
My love isn't unfulfilled.

19
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.370 line:82%
And still... unrequited?

20
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.200 line:82%
I'd only heard of the
power of one-sided love...

21
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.160 line:82%
now I understand it.

22
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.790 line:82%
Does this love have a name?

23
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.200 line:82%
What kind of hug was that?

24
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.080 line:82%
-Means?
-'Mmmmm'!

25
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.000 line:82%
I wasn't aware that
hugs had standards.

26
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.870 line:82%
Listen... Save these sentimental
hugs for your family,

27
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.330 line:82%
not girls you're hooking up with!

28
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.710 line:82%
And what was that kiss?

29
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.230 line:82%
Excuse me! All my ex-girlfriends
say I'm a great kisser!

30
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.950 line:82%
Really? People will say
anything these days...

31
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.250 line:82%
Great kisser...
what kind of guy are you?

32
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.190 line:82%
A guilty one.

33
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.790 line:82%
Guilty?

34
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.280 line:82%
Why?

35
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.080 line:82%
I have a girlfriend.

36
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.410 line:82%
So? I've got a boyfriend.

37
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.580 line:82%
And you're not guilty?

38
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.580 line:82%
Look... boyfriends are like movies...

39
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.290 line:82%
Some flops... some blockbusters!

40
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.500 line:82%
And Dr. Faisal was
chosen by my father...

41
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.450 line:82%
Won't take too long to flop.

42
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.830 line:82%
Anyway...

43
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.120 line:82%
this was...

44
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.160 line:82%
alright.

45
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.860 line:82%
No, no... it's... done.

46
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.510 line:82%
-Sure?
-Definitely!

47
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.370 line:82%
Nice meeting you.

48
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.870 line:82%
Bye!

49
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.410 line:82%
Are you following me?

50
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.120 line:82%
I don't know anyone here.

51
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.200 line:82%
What do you want me to do?

52
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.200 line:82%
Take you around like a tour guide?

53
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.830 line:82%
"Hello, Party! Meet Hugh Heffner...
world's best kisser!"

54
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.580 line:82%
Hello!

55
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.500 line:82%
What's with the attitude?

56
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.200 line:82%
Hello, hello, hello!

57
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.500 line:82%
Did you feel bad?

58
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.790 line:82%
Why so touchy, baby?

59
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.040 line:82%
Just... fought with my girlfriend.

60
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.160 line:82%
I fought with my boyfriend, too!

61
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.080 line:82%
Just two lost souls
swimming in a fish bowl!

62
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.440 line:82%
-Filmy!
-Totally! Why'd you guys fight?

63
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.950 line:82%
If I tell you, you'll judge me...

64
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.630 line:82%
Oh, I've already judged
you with that kiss.

65
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.070 line:82%
Just tell me!

66
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.370 line:82%
So... we were late for this party,

67
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.490 line:82%
so when I saw Lisa, I asked her why
she hadn't worn her clothes yet.

68
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.450 line:82%
And she said...
"I'm already dressed!"

69
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.030 line:82%
No way!
Short or skimpy?

70
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.620 line:82%
Both! She showed up
in a bikini, I swear!

71
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.750 line:82%
Man... It's up to her!

72
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.410 line:82%
You stink of male chauvinism!

73
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.450 line:82%
Are you saying it's my fault?

74
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.830 line:82%
I know too many boys like you!

75
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.800 line:82%
You're so judgmental!

76
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.910 line:82%
Happily judgmental!

77
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.370 line:82%
Now... If you're done,
can we get out of here?

78
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.620 line:82%
Where to?

79
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.780 line:82%
Bar hopping!

80
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.860 line:82%
With me?

81
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.980 line:82%
Well, I'm not going alone!

82
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.370 line:82%
Okay, let's go!

83
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.700 line:82%
Let's go!

84
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.370 line:82%
We haven't been properly introduced!

85
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.870 line:82%
My name is Alizeh Khan.
Khan, and I'm not a terrorist!

86
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.290 line:82%
Rahul...

87
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.410 line:82%
like in "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai".

88
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.450 line:82%
Are you joking or
is that really your name?

89
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.160 line:82%
It was a joke!

90
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.750 line:82%
I don't like jokes!

91
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.290 line:82%
I don't like you!

92
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.430 line:82%
-Name?
-Ayan... Ayan Sanger.

93
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.890 line:82%
Ayan Sanger...
It's the time to disco!

94
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.320 line:82%
Look! My girlfriend's apologizing!

95
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.040 line:82%
She's apologizing?

96
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.330 line:82%
Yeah... I feel bad...

97
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.410 line:82%
How rich are you?

98
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.910 line:82%
What does that have
to do with anything?

99
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.830 line:82%
Well, it's not because
of your good looks, is it?

100
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.500 line:82%
-Yes!
-Sure...

101
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.410 line:82%
So... you're rich, right?

102
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.430 line:82%
Yeah... I'm rich.

103
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.450 line:82%
First Class or Private Jet?

104
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.290 line:82%
Private Jet.

105
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.620 line:82%
I knew it!

106
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.250 line:82%
She's a gold-digger!

107
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.410 line:82%
Are you poor?

108
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.540 line:82%
Well, my father's rich...
I'm wealthy. Big difference.

109
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.020 line:82%
What's the difference?

110
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.220 line:82%
I'm the 4th of 4 daughters.

111
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.790 line:82%
Youngest kids usually get
the most love, but not in my family...

112
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.580 line:82%
My mom left me when I was 2.

113
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.450 line:82%
What?

114
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.120 line:82%
She ran away.

115
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.360 line:82%
Mothers are like Teresa...
yours is Usain Bolt!

116
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.610 line:82%
My mom...

117
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.450 line:82%
I'm so sorry.
That's wrong.

118
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.160 line:82%
Why did she leave?

119
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.160 line:82%
I was never allowed to ask...

120
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.290 line:82%
Now...

121
00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.540 line:82%
What difference does it make?

122
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.620 line:82%
You must be close to your dad, right?

123
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.940 line:82%
Yeah...

124
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.290 line:82%
What do you do
in London, anyway?

125
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.790 line:82%
M.B.A!

126
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.200 line:82%
You don't look the
the business type!

127
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.200 line:82%
Another one of your Daddy's dreams?

128
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.700 line:82%
Don't you have a dream of your own?

129
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.580 line:82%
I...

130
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.620 line:82%
What? Is it illegal?

131
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.000 line:82%
I want to sing.

132
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:42.830 line:82%
Sing!

133
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.250 line:82%
But my voice won't help
my father's company... so...

134
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.770 line:82%
Sink it, maybe!

135
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.330 line:82%
-Hey!
-Sorry...

136
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.350 line:82%
I sing really well! Lots of people

137
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.690 line:82%
think I sing like Mohammed Rafi.

138
00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.040 line:82%
Shall I sing for you?

139
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.080 line:82%
What did I ever do to you?

140
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.620 line:82%
And doesn't Mohammed Rafi
always sound like he's crying?

141
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.080 line:82%
What's better than crying?

142
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.990 line:82%
I'm not a fan...

143
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.870 line:82%
And not of laughing, either!
I take the road less taken.

144
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:15.810 line:82%
Which is?

145
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.290 line:82%
Life.

146
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.790 line:82%
-You talk like you're Amitabh Bachchan!
-I wish!

147
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.410 line:82%
Do you do anything but talk?

148
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.660 line:82%
Or do you rip apart
men's ego's for a living?

149
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.700 line:82%
Please... I'm really busy!

150
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.280 line:82%
Sometimes I do yoga.

151
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.660 line:82%
Buddhist chanting...
I'm learning French...

152
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.660 line:82%
Bollywood Dance class,
sometimes...

153
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.620 line:82%
Like the wind,
I'm everywhere.

154
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.330 line:82%
My name is registered
in any and every course.

155
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.910 line:82%
But this register
has someone else's name.

156
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.080 line:82%
Who's Ali?

157
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.140 line:82%
Nobody.

158
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.200 line:82%
Hello, Ali... Who you?

159
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.750 line:82%
Let me go, he's no one!

160
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.850 line:82%
-Look, the train is here.
-Who is Ali?

161
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.910 line:82%
Who is Ali?

162
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.200 line:82%
My apocalypse.

163
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.750 line:82%
I was studying in Lucknow
when I first met Ali.

164
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.550 line:82%
The sexy, smouldering, deep DJ Ali...

165
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.450 line:82%
It was like music
was a part of his soul.

166
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.200 line:82%
He was as absorbed in his music...
as I was in him.

167
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.420 line:82%
I thought we were in love...
he never bothered to correct me.

168
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.200 line:82%
But in truth,
he was the love of my life,

169
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330 line:82%
and I was just his habit.

170
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.120 line:82%
So, what happened?

171
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.540 line:82%
What could happen?
He found another habit.

172
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.910 line:82%
Decided that was love.

173
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.620 line:82%
She was this goddamned
beautiful airhostess.

174
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.070 line:82%
She showed him where
her emergency exits were...

175
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.830 line:82%
and that was that.

176
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.350 line:82%
And me and my broken
heart found our way to London.

177
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.830 line:82%
But you still love him?

178
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.620 line:82%
That question makes me feel weak.

179
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.000 line:82%
So thank God for Dr. Faisal.

180
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.790 line:82%
At least he's nice to look at...

181
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.870 line:82%
Great distraction!

182
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.410 line:82%
My Lisa is very, very hot.

183
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.620 line:82%
What do you mean, "very hot"?

184
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.410 line:82%
Very hot.

185
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.540 line:82%
Wanna bet?

186
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.910 line:82%
Bet what?

187
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.200 line:82%
Come on...
I bet mine's hotter than yours.

188
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.200 line:82%
Done! Double date... tomorrow night?

189
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.120 line:82%
It's on.

190
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.200 line:82%
What if I win?

191
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.730 line:82%
Then I'll let you kiss me again.

192
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.870 line:82%
But you won't win!

193
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.330 line:82%
Shall we?
I'm very drunk...

194
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.620 line:82%
Listen! Don't puke or anything!

195
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.700 line:82%
No, no, no, I'm okay, I'm okay!

196
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.410 line:82%
-You didn't have to do that!
-Where are we?

197
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.160 line:82%
This! This is my happy place.

198
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.660 line:82%
I come here when the
world gets too much,

199
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.450 line:82%
when I want to
spend time with myself

200
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.870 line:82%
because this is the only place
on earth that knows

201
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.540 line:82%
love is crooked.

202
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.450 line:82%
Crooked!

203
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.540 line:82%
I'll make you an
offer you can't refuse.

204
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:36.570 line:82%
I see... Can you offer me
your address?

205
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.150 line:82%
-Wine?
-Yes, please.

206
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.330 line:82%
Two, please.

207
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.250 line:82%
Hi! I'm looking for Alizeh Khan.

208
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.880 line:82%

Hi... Hi, guys!

I'm Lisa D'souza,
but you can call me Lisa.

214
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.750 line:82%
That's your first name...
what else would we call you?

215
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.290 line:82%
Exactly!

216
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.620 line:82%
Your last names are Khan, right?

217
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.990 line:82%
'Cuz I've been practicing
this all day long.

218
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.290 line:82%
Here, honey, hold my bag...

219
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.790 line:82%

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.410 line:82%
Salaam Waalequm!

221
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.950 line:82%
Waalequm Salaam...

222
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.500 line:82%
Was that good?

223
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.370 line:82%
That was good, right?

224
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.760 line:82%
Great.

225
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.410 line:82%
And what... No namaste for us?

226
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.890 line:82%
Okay! The table's ready!

227
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.350 line:82%
Where do you practise?

228
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.540 line:82%
You look ill...

229
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.700 line:82%
Do you have the flu?

230
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.160 line:82%
'Cuz it's kind of in the air...

231
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.160 line:82%
No, I'm alright.

232
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.910 line:82%
Alizeh...

233
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.040 line:82%
I never asked...
How do you two know each other?

234
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.200 line:82%
We're family friends.

235
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.910 line:82%
Oh, but we're family friends...
I've never met him.

236
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.410 line:82%
Well... He's my friend's family...

237
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.080 line:82%
So... family friends!

238
00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.700 line:82%
Honey, see...

239
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.140 line:82%
It's amazing...
how we're all so connected!

240
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.710 line:82%
How long have you'll been together?

241
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.720 line:82%
How long has it been?

242
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.040 line:82%
Honey!

243
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.330 line:82%
Tomorrow is our
one-month anniversary!

244
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.530 line:82%
Happy anniversary...

245
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.410 line:82%
How sweet!
Where'd you meet?

246
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.410 line:82%
-Gym!
-Online!

247
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.910 line:82%
Gym.

248
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.320 line:82%
It's a gym called Online.
Really good.

249
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.000 line:82%
Yeah, and he was so cute.

250
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.700 line:82%
He saw me going into the sauna
and he started singing,

251
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.700 line:82%
"Feeling hot, hot, hot!"

252
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.490 line:82%
Adorable.

253
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.000 line:82%
And you guys?

254
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.670 line:82%
Well, our fathers are
very dear to one another.

255
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.500 line:82%
Why not turn such
a close bond into family?

256
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.040 line:82%
Wow... Urdu is so exotic...

257
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.870 line:82%
Like French... but not French!

258
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.450 line:82%
Because it's Urdu?

259
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.870 line:82%
Exactly!

260
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.290 line:82%
Hindi's beautiful, too.

261
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.950 line:82%
Only when Mr. Bachchan speaks
on Who Wants to be a Millionaire!

262
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.170 line:82%
She loves that show.

263
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.610 line:82%
Yeah, I love it!
He totally nails hindi!

264
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.290 line:82%
He used this word once...

265
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.140 line:82%
'Vaatavaran'!

266
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.050 line:82%
And I was like, "Oh my God!

267
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.830 line:82%
I love that word!
What does it mean?

268
00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.870 line:82%
Ayan said it means...

269
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.750 line:82%
"Vibe"!

270
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.160 line:82%
So me and the girls
use it all the time.

271
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.160 line:82%
I just love the
"vaatavaran" of this club...

272
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.620 line:82%
I just love the
"vaatavaran" of this bar...

273
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.290 line:82%
I just love the word.

274
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.370 line:82%
Alizeh, you should come
out with my girlfriends some time.

275
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.750 line:82%
We could do like a girly lunch!

276
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.870 line:82%
I have food allergies...
and people allergies, too.

277
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.490 line:82%
-You'll could go watch a movie, Alizeh!
-Yeah! You love movies!

278
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.080 line:82%
Yeah, we should see a movie!

279
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.700 line:82%
Actually, I just watched
a great French film... Priceless!

280
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.860 line:82%
-I've seen it!
-Oh, yeah?

281
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.580 line:82%
-I really love it!
-What's it about?

282
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.000 line:82%
This immoral hussy...

283
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:26.010 line:82%
-Prostitute.
-...lures rich men for their money...

284
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.000 line:82%
You know what, Lisa,
you should watch it.

285
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.320 line:82%
I think you'll like it.

286
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.950 line:82%
Why? What do you mean?

287
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.000 line:82%
Just... It's a good film.

288
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.870 line:82%
How dare you?

289
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.830 line:82%
Honey, how dare she?

290
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.500 line:82%
How dare you?

291
00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.950 line:82%
They're asking, "how dare you?"

292
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.290 line:82%
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

293
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.080 line:82%
I had no idea you could think...

294
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.660 line:82%
I think we should place the...
Yes, excuse me.

295
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.410 line:82%
Wow, you're even
stupider than you look...

296
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.410 line:82%
Who throws red wine on black?

297
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.290 line:82%
Oh my God,
I can't believe she did this to me!

298
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.320 line:82%
She's a very weird, weird girl!

299
00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.410 line:82%
Stop touching me right now!

300
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.200 line:82%
Come on, let's get a cab.

301
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.120 line:82%
Baby... don't cry...

302
00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.950 line:82%
Okay... Who wants
some low fat yogurt!

303
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.580 line:82%
Go away!

304
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.370 line:82%
She humiliated me...

305
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.660 line:82%
insulted me.

306
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.330 line:82%
But you, Ayan...

307
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.830 line:82%
you never stand up for me!

308
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.660 line:82%
I... always stand up for you.

309
00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.330 line:82%
I have a heart...

310
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.720 line:82%
Yeah.

311
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.870 line:82%
I have a heart, Goddamnit!

312
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.710 line:82%
Come... Come here!

313
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.760 line:82%
Open doors and open drawers!

314
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.880 line:82%
Hi!

315
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.330 line:82%
Hello!

316
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.940 line:82%
Here... why?

317
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.480 line:82%
I was just doing yoga...

318
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.610 line:82%
If I may say,
your form is remarkable.

319
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.150 line:82%
Where is
Mademoiselle Skimpy, anyway?

320
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.860 line:82%
Lisa was really upset yesterday!

321
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.100 line:82%
Why? She couldn't
find your chequebook?

322
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.320 line:82%
Hey!

323
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.480 line:82%
Have some respect!

324
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.940 line:82%
For your boxers?

325
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.110 line:82%
What is this?

326
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.200 line:82%
It's for you!

327
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.270 line:82%
To hell with Lisa!

328
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.060 line:82%
You're cute...

329
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.770 line:82%
I came to apologise.

330
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.980 line:82%
With this?

331
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.860 line:82%
What, you want flowers?

332
00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.080 line:82%
Yes!

333
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.100 line:82%
I hate flowers.

334
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.650 line:82%
What did flowers ever do to you?

335
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.900 line:82%
Flowers are so overrated!

336
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.520 line:82%
Yeah, they look pretty,
smell nice,

337
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.280 line:82%
but colours fade
and scent disappears,

338
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.270 line:82%
and what you're left with
is lifeless, wilted, and diseased.

339
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.980 line:82%
Thorns, on the other hand...

340
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.150 line:82%
They're not so fragile...

341
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.730 line:82%
Thorns are fearless.

342
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.980 line:82%
I don't want to be just a flower...

343
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.690 line:82%
I want to be a thorn.

344
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.020 line:82%
I want to smack you!

345
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.110 line:82%
Though she be little,
but she is fierce!

346
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.360 line:82%
Please, sir, share your gruel.

347
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.890 line:82%
God, take it already.

348
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.310 line:82%
May a thousand
Gods shine upon you.

349
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.980 line:82%
You have to admit...
songs of the 80's were amazing...

350
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.560 line:82%
Cheap, vulgar, and extra tacky!

351
00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.560 line:82%
My playlist is "Cheap Thrills"!

352
00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.230 line:82%
No way... mine is
"Jolly Good Bollywood"!

353
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.120 line:82%
Most famous song of the 80's?

354
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.940 line:82%
-Film?
-Himmatwala!

355
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.770 line:82%
Cheapest song?

356
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.160 line:82%
Film?

357
00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.860 line:82%
Maqsad, 1984!

358
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.020 line:82%
You're not my long
lost brother, are you?

359
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.860 line:82%
No but maybe the Doctor is!

360
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.480 line:82%
Hopefully he'll
just be long lost!

361
00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.400 line:82%
So... what are you
doing at 4 PM today?

362
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.180 line:82%
I'm very busy...
Meetings, appointments...

363
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.290 line:82%
Shut up! You're free!

364
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.730 line:82%
Okay... I am!

365
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.670 line:82%
Sir!
Please give me a little more.

366
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.050 line:82%
Get lost!

367
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.480 line:82%
-What's the problem?
-Problem?

368
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.640 line:82%
I saw you busting
your moves at home,

369
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.860 line:82%
what's with the
dainty flailing now?

370
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.520 line:82%
It's embarrassing.

371
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.110 line:82%
Embarrassing?

372
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.480 line:82%
Embarrassment is just a fancy
word for self-importance.

373
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.980 line:82%
You're nobody here!

374
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:41.150 line:82%
So you're not shaming
Daddy Dearest...

375
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.220 line:82%
Nor are you embarrassing yourself!

376
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.730 line:82%
Just dance, man!

377
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.730 line:82%
I can't dance in groups... only sing.

378
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.800 line:82%
Oh, really?
And that's amazing,

379
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.360 line:82%
but this isn't choir
practice it's a dance class!

380
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.110 line:82%
It's just not my scene...

381
00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.900 line:82%
Shh! Just dance!

382
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.650 line:82%
Forget your inner Lois Lane,

383
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.650 line:82%
you were born to be Wonder Woman!

384
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.520 line:82%
In the name of JLo's sex appeal,

385
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.360 line:82%
show this cruel world,
you truly are a Baby Doll!

386
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.650 line:82%
Baby Doll!

387
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.520 line:82%
You're off your rocker...

388
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.480 line:82%
Get ready.

389
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.310 line:82%
See that girl...

390
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.560 line:82%
Watch that scene...

391
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.690 line:82%
Digging the Dancing Queen!

392
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.150 line:82%
That was awesome!

393
00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.430 line:82%
You were right, I feel great!

394
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.730 line:82%
Told ya!

395
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.991 line:82%
But if you thought
this was impressive...

396
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.560 line:82%
wait 'til you hear me sing.

397
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.650 line:82%
You'll be a fan!

398
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.270 line:82%
God...

399
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.660 line:82%
Sing!

400
00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.650 line:82%
-What?
-Sing!

401
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.690 line:82%
-What do you mean "sing"?
-Sing means sing... Sing!

402
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.680 line:82%
-Here?
-Where else?

403
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.020 line:82%
On this sidewalk?

404
00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.860 line:82%
Not again!

405
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.400 line:82%
Why are you getting annoyed?

406
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.060 line:82%
Because, Celine Dion...

407
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:51.650 line:82%
Your self-praise is
driving me up the wall!

408
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.140 line:82%
You're not taking me seriously...
My voice is a gift from God!

409
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.900 line:82%
Then sing for Him!

410
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.190 line:82%
No!

411
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.450 line:82%
Don't be so attention seeking, man!

412
00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.690 line:82%
What if you fall in love with me?

413
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.960 line:82%
Well, Mr. Casablanca...

414
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.440 line:82%
I'll take my chances!

415
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.230 line:82%
Come on... Sing.

416
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.770 line:82%
No.

417
00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.840 line:82%
Not singing?

418
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.610 line:82%
This is your last chance.

419
00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.520 line:82%
No?

420
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.440 line:82%
Okay... then get lost!

421
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.940 line:82%
How was that?

422
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.410 line:82%
Abhorrent!

423
00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.930 line:82%
Ab-what?

424
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.860 line:82%
That sounded like
an ad for constipation!

425
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:10.980 line:82%
Yuck!

426
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.020 line:82%
Following a tune isn't singing...

427
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.400 line:82%
It had no pain, no emotion.

428
00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.060 line:82%
-And you're an expert, so...
-I'm the audience!

429
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.810 line:82%
There was no feeling.

430
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.660 line:82%
Because this...
has never been broken.

431
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.770 line:82%
You'll only really sing
when it does break.

432
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.770 line:82%
Till then, you can do your MBA,
make some money

433
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.230 line:82%
and leave music alone.

434
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.720 line:82%
See you later... Bye!

435
00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.360 line:82%
Charlie Brown...
are you feeling blue?

436
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.690 line:82%
Hmmm...

437
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.060 line:82%
Hm!

438
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.920 line:82%
-I knew you'd call to apologise.
-You wish!

439
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.480 line:82%
No sorry, no thank you
in the bro code.

440
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.205 line:82%
-Whatever.
-Listen!

441
00:30:34.306 --> 00:30:36.420 line:82%
I've made another
great plan for a double date!

442
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:37.940 line:82%
No, I've had enough!

443
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.400 line:82%
Just hear me out!

444
00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.400 line:82%
The plan involves not
listening to Lisa's crap,

445
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.360 line:82%
and watching you dance!

446
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.980 line:82%
Because you're my dancing star!

447
00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.170 line:82%
What?

448
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.560 line:82%
Silent Disco, bro!

449
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.700 line:82%
I'm not your bro.

450
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.440 line:82%
Because you're my dancing star!

451
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.020 line:82%
Bye.

452
00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:07.860 line:82%
Here!

453
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.810 line:82%
Excuse us!

454
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.440 line:82%
-Doctor!
-Hi.

455
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.020 line:82%
Alizeh and I wanted to
apologise for the other day...

456
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.350 line:82%
What? No!

457
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.560 line:82%
Shush!

458
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.650 line:82%
Thank you, Doctor.

459
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.900 line:82%
That's so sweet...

460
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.150 line:82%
Eid Mubarak.

461
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.250 line:82%
Eid Mubarak?

462
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.610 line:82%
-Today's not Eid...
-Let it go, let it go!

463
00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.630 line:82%
So! If you like the
"vaatavaran" of this place...

464
00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.100 line:82%
wear your headphones,

465
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.520 line:82%
switch to a channel you like,
and dance!

466
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:40.650 line:82%
And here's an added bonus...

467
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.350 line:82%
-What's this?
-This is the nectar of love...

468
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.690 line:82%
Like dreaming while you're awake.

469
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.550 line:82%
-Cheers! Cheers?
-Cheers!

470
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.970 line:82%
I'll be right back.

471
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.190 line:82%
Alizeh!

472
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.350 line:82%
You've just disappeared!
Where have you been?

473
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.150 line:82%
-In London!
-Shut up!

474
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.980 line:82%
You broke up with Ali
and forgot us all!

475
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.060 line:82%
-Are you okay?
-Yeah! Okay, listen...

476
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.020 line:82%
Play a desi song, man!

477
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.720 line:82%
This EDM is making my head spin...

478
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.150 line:82%
What? Here?

479
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.440 line:82%
Just one!

480
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.060 line:82%
Well... I have one...

481
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.650 line:82%
But it's a break up song...

482
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.310 line:82%
Then for sure!

483
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.900 line:82%
-Okay, tune into 4!
-Okay.

484
00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:05.580 line:82%
God, I have to pee!

485
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.230 line:82%
Excuse me, there's a queue.

486
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.230 line:82%
I know, but I really
have to go... Please?

487
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.860 line:82%
Where'd Lisa disappear?

488
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.900 line:82%
Screw this, I'm going to the men's.

489
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.400 line:82%
Excuse me, this is the men's loo.

490
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.520 line:82%
I know... but sometimes even
I feel like I could be a man...

491
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.900 line:82%
Doctor... Can you check my pulse?

492
00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.400 line:82%
Don't cry, don't cry...

493
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.980 line:82%
My boyfriend's a douchebag, too!
Don't cry!

494
00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:52.480 line:82%
I'll get us a cab, okay?

495
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.230 line:82%
Tell him your address!

496
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.310 line:82%
I don't want to be alone tonight.

497
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.770 line:82%
Take me with you.

498
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.560 line:82%
You've gone insane!

499
00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.920 line:82%
Ayan, get up!

500
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.520 line:82%
No? Fine, go to hell!

501
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.060 line:82%
Bye, Ayan!

502
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.480 line:82%
Sit there!

503
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:50.650 line:82%
There?

504
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.520 line:82%
Alizeh...

505
00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.150 line:82%
What was in that drink?

506
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.360 line:82%
Nectar of love...

507
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.230 line:82%
My foot!

508
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.400 line:82%
Lost my love...

509
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.230 line:82%
My heart is shattered!

510
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.320 line:82%
Now little pieces of my heart

511
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.630 line:82%
are buzzing around me like flies...

512
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.610 line:82%
Done?

513
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.310 line:82%
Stop behaving like a spoilt child!

514
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.060 line:82%
Someone just snatched
your favourite toy!

515
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.980 line:82%
Your heart is just fine!

516
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.860 line:82%
What do you even
know about heartbreak!

517
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.940 line:82%
Sorry, only you know everything!

518
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.310 line:82%
Listen!

519
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.020 line:82%
A thousand people have
their heart broken every day...

520
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.940 line:82%
And I've been down that road!

521
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:06.560 line:82%
You've never even been
in the neighbourhood!

522
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.940 line:82%
You're not even in love!

523
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:12.690 line:82%
You know what...

524
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.190 line:82%
Come.

525
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.180 line:82%
Lie down here.

526
00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.980 line:82%
-Alizeh, I'm not in the mood for sex...
-I'll slap you again!

527
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:22.110 line:82%
Lie down!

528
00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.060 line:82%
Lie down!

529
00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.020 line:82%
Now...

530
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.900 line:82%
Does it hurt?

531
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:34.940 line:82%
That's heartbreak.

532
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.760 line:82%
-Now?
-I'm okay.

533
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:38.940 line:82%
This is Lisa!

534
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.900 line:82%
Heartbreak!
Lisa!

535
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:42.750 line:82%
Heartbreak!
Lisa!

536
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.310 line:82%
I understood, I've got it!

537
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:46.980 line:82%
Good!

538
00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:51.110 line:82%
Now please go home!
The high must have worn off.

539
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.610 line:82%
This is Heartbreak Hotel, my friend...
You have to be qualified!

540
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.730 line:82%
You've driven me mad all night...
Go away!

541
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.340 line:82%
There she is... Ms. Gone Girl, herself.

542
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.090 line:82%
I'm sorry, Ayan.

543
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.840 line:82%
I truly am.

544
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.920 line:82%
Will you call me?

545
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.770 line:82%
No.

546
00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.430 line:82%
No.

547
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:25.420 line:82%
Jesus be with you.

548
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:27.970 line:82%
Both of you.

549
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.560 line:82%
Lisa!

550
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.870 line:82%
Lisa!

551
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.050 line:82%
Lisa!

552
00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.220 line:82%
Ye evil shrew!

553
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.550 line:82%
Ye wayward wench!

554
00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.850 line:82%
May thee be attack'd by
the fireth of a thousand suns!

555
00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.970 line:82%
Burneth, thee shrew! This is the
beshrew of a wrong'd mistress!

556
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.340 line:82%
Beshrew!

557
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:54.830 line:82%
Beshrew?

558
00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:56.490 line:82%
What's that?

559
00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.000 line:82%
Curse!

560
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.510 line:82%
Please don't curse me.

561
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.470 line:82%
Be gone, evil wench!

562
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.920 line:82%
If thee ev'r showeth thy face again,
thee shall be ruin'd!

563
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.300 line:82%
I'll help her with the bags.

564
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.910 line:82%
Are you crazy?

565
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.970 line:82%
Out of here, black-hearted wench!

566
00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.950 line:82%
I've been dreaming of
talking like that for years!

567
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.390 line:82%
I'm having the best time!

568
00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.490 line:82%
Now what?

569
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:29.020 line:82%
Now?

570
00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.920 line:82%
Now! Recovery Retreat!

571
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.130 line:82%
Recovery Retreat?

572
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.820 line:82%
Recovery Retreat!
Heartbreak Holiday, dude...

573
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.120 line:82%
I told Dad that I've been
hurt because of him,

574
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:42.880 line:82%
now I need to go and recover!

575
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.340 line:82%
The plan is... Paris!

576
00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.590 line:82%
What are you doing this weekend?

577
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.170 line:82%
I'm very busy... Classes,
appointments...

578
00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.630 line:82%
Shuddap! You're free!

579
00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.090 line:82%
Tell your father...
I've kidnapped you.

580
00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:05.250 line:82%
I'll call the travel agent and
confirm it. I'll message him.

581
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.440 line:82%
He never responds in time!

582
00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:10.390 line:82%
Excited!

583
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.310 line:82%
Why are you so clingy?

584
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.590 line:82%
What's the rating of this place?

585
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.590 line:82%
5 stars! 3 for the hotel
and 2 for us!

586
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.090 line:82%
1 you, plus 1 me equals 1 room?

587
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.670 line:82%
2 hotel rooms equals over budget!

588
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:51.340 line:82%
What if you take advantage of me?

589
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.010 line:82%
Shut up!

590
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.630 line:82%
Wow, nice!

591
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:01.420 line:82%
Yeah, man! I love hotel rooms!

592
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.520 line:82%
I wish I could live
in a hotel forever!

593
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:08.970 line:82%
Exactly!!

594
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.830 line:82%
New beds, new pillows!

595
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.690 line:82%
New soap, new shampoo! For free!

596
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.560 line:82%
Minibar!

597
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.630 line:82%
That's not free!
You have to pay for it!

598
00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.300 line:82%
And you know what the best part is?

599
00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:25.580 line:82%
Room service!

600
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.260 line:82%
I'll find a menu.

601
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.850 line:82%
Alizeh, have you ever
had paratha and eggs?

602
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:31.050 line:82%
Like you'll get that here!

603
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.340 line:82%
No, no...

604
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.510 line:82%
That feeling I get when I eat that...

605
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:41.500 line:82%
I'm getting that feeling today...

606
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:44.800 line:82%
Like my heart is full.

607
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.260 line:82%
You know?

608
00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.360 line:82%
I never want to lose this feeling.

609
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.300 line:82%
I know that feeling.

610
00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:58.010 line:82%
I feel like I'm
starring in my own film.

611
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:04.060 line:82%
I want to dance, I want to sing,
I want to go crazy on the streets!

612
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.090 line:82%
Feeling hot, hot, hot...

613
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.630 line:82%
You think I'm nuts.

614
00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.510 line:82%
No, dude... I've got
Bollywood in my blood, too.

615
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.800 line:82%
I want to wear sarees
and run around mountains, too!

616
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.170 line:82%
The hills are alive...

617
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.130 line:82%
But you know what?

618
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.040 line:82%
I still have one
unrequited Bollywood dream...

619
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.380 line:82%
Which one?

620
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.920 line:82%
The airport dream.

621
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.170 line:82%
The airport dream. For so long
I dreamed that I would be that girl

622
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.720 line:82%
the one the boy chased through
the airport and confessed his love.

623
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.590 line:82%
Twice I thought he'd come...

624
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.550 line:82%
Both times I waited for him.

625
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.880 line:82%
And both times, he didn't come.

626
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.840 line:82%
Mademoiselle, we are Private Jet
people. We don't have airport dreams.

627
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.870 line:82%
We're young,
we're free and you're in Paris

628
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.300 line:82%
with the future Mohd. Rafi!

629
00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:57.840 line:82%
What's your point, dude?

630
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:32.470 line:82%
-Now?
-Now what?

631
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:33.800 line:82%
Plan?

632
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:35.630 line:82%
Plan?

633
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.930 line:82%
Wait for it...

634
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.050 line:82%
Oi, Hero!

635
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:02.130 line:82%
Come up!

636
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.440 line:82%
Help!

637
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.590 line:82%
Do you know how to tie a saree?

638
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:09.340 line:82%
I know how to take it off.

639
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.170 line:82%
Disgusting.

640
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.680 line:82%
Now, let's learn how
to tie a simple saree.

641
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.970 line:82%
Ensure your petticoat
and blouse are matching.

642
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.490 line:82%
Now, this is how to
start draping a saree...

643
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.250 line:82%
Okay?

644
00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:26.350 line:82%
Okay...

645
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:31.550 line:82%
Alizeh, if I go around you again...
we'll have to get married!

646
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.380 line:82%
Just shut up.

647
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.420 line:82%
I'll slap you!

648
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.510 line:82%
Start pleating like so...

649
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:59.600 line:82%
and tuck it in.

650
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:07.221 line:82%
Sexy.

651
00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.670 line:82%
Not sexier than you.

652
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.720 line:82%
Shot's ready!

653
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:18.840 line:82%
And so am I!

654
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:29.340 line:82%
My morning prayer!

655
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.970 line:82%
Are you serious?

656
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:42.420 line:82%
Do you even see what I'm wearing?

657
00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:44.300 line:82%
Idiot!

658
00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.340 line:82%
Get up now! Come on!

659
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.760 line:82%
Where's my jacket?

660
00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.920 line:82%
You know, you're useless!

661
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.510 line:82%
Dude... Bollywood people are nuts!

662
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.120 line:82%
It's too freaking cold for romance!

663
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.340 line:82%
Come on in!

664
00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.930 line:82%
You should be called Henessy,
not Alizeh.

665
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.100 line:82%
Cognac's not really liquor.

666
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.010 line:82%
Of course it is! Give it here!

667
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.550 line:82%
You really like me, right?

668
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:39.510 line:82%
You really like me.

669
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:44.800 line:82%
Like really, really, really like me.

670
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:47.420 line:82%
Don't lie... because I've noticed.

671
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.250 line:82%
Yeah.

672
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.800 line:82%
I really like you!

673
00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:52.760 line:82%
Why? Quick, tell me.

674
00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:55.380 line:82%
I don't know, man.

675
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.790 line:82%
The first time we met,

676
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.030 line:82%
when we spent the night talking,

677
00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:06.500 line:82%
I just got the feeling
that you're my friend...

678
00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.340 line:82%
My best friend

679
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:11.670 line:82%
and always will be.

680
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:13.280 line:82%
I don't know...

681
00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.470 line:82%
You know, I wasn't popular in school.

682
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:26.970 line:82%
They thought I was a weirdo,
freak, introverted...

683
00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:30.800 line:82%
And honestly, it made no difference.

684
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:32.840 line:82%
You know why?

685
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.170 line:82%
Because I knew I was
holding on to my personality.

686
00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.510 line:82%
I was waiting to find that one person,

687
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.840 line:82%
who got my weirdness.

688
00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.380 line:82%
So... best friend, huh?

689
00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.470 line:82%
Bestest friend!

690
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.090 line:82%
And you're not attracted to me?

691
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.370 line:82%
No.

692
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.960 line:82%
What's wrong?

693
00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.760 line:82%
Ego's a bit bruised.

694
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:35.800 line:82%
Are you attracted?

695
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:37.940 line:82%
Like...

696
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:39.700 line:82%
a lot?

697
00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:44.570 line:82%
Not a lot... But... yeah, I am.

698
00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.510 line:82%
Don't feel weird...
I don't love you or anything.

699
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:57.800 line:82%
No, no... I know that.

700
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:06.010 line:82%
You know,
I'm really happy we're friends...

701
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:10.440 line:82%
I feel that sometimes lust

702
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.910 line:82%
just kills friendship...

703
00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.170 line:82%
Love is passion,

704
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.470 line:82%
but friendship is peace.

705
00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:27.010 line:82%
And I never, ever want
to lose the peace between us.

706
00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.000 line:82%
Girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife...

707
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:33.920 line:82%
when those relationships die,
the people just leave.

708
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:41.940 line:82%
And I never want to leave you, Ayan.

709
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.170 line:82%
-Never?
-Never.

710
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:53.090 line:82%
Wow, I feel all mushy...

711
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.340 line:82%
What do I do?

712
00:54:58.610 --> 00:54:59.620 line:82%
Go ahead...

713
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.340 line:82%
I'm feeling a little mushy, myself...

714
00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:04.920 line:82%
Give me a hug.

715
00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:35.670 line:82%
-I've decided that...
-What?

716
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:39.050 line:82%
I've decided we're
staying here another week!

717
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:44.300 line:82%
Oh, no... I'm really busy...
Meetings, appointments...

718
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:46.380 line:82%
Shuddap! You're free!

719
00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.800 line:82%
Okay, I am!

720
00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.320 line:82%
-So good?
-Yes, poopie! Yes!

721
00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:58.220 line:82%
Can we get two beers and
something to eat... like peanuts...

722
00:55:58.350 --> 00:55:59.810 line:82%
Peanuts... you know, peanuts?

723
00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.450 line:82%
Kidding... just beer, please!

724
00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:04.010 line:82%
Stop staring and pay!

725
00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:29.220 line:82%
Ayan, I need to go back.

726
00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.300 line:82%
I need to get out of here.

727
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:35.400 line:82%
You can stay if you want,
I just need to go.

728
00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:37.000 line:82%
One sec, I'll organize the plane...

729
00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:39.800 line:82%
I'll walk home if I have to,
I just need to go right now!

730
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.340 line:82%
Where's my stuff?

731
00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.220 line:82%
This room is such a mess.

732
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.260 line:82%
Alizeh, are you okay?

733
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.550 line:82%
Alizeh... are you alright?

734
00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:07.840 line:82%
Are you okay, Alizeh?

735
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.670 line:82%
I'm fine, Ayan! Just stop! I'm fine!

736
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.170 line:82%
I'm fine!

737
00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.670 line:82%
I'm fine!

738
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.130 line:82%
He can't come back...

739
00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.550 line:82%
I don't want to see him.

740
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:31.050 line:82%
He was gone.
I erased every trace of him...

741
00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:36.370 line:82%
He can't come back,
do you understand?

742
00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.840 line:82%
Yeah, Captain...
Terminal FBO 4, right?

743
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.970 line:82%
Okay... 45 minutes.

744
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:12.800 line:82%
Thank you so much!

745
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:15.380 line:82%
Alizeh... Alizeh!

746
00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.970 line:82%
Sir, please!
She doesn't want to talk to you!

747
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:18.500 line:82%
Who the hell is this?
Your lover?

748
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:20.130 line:82%
-I'm her friend.
-I wasn't speaking to you!

749
00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:21.560 line:82%
Well, she doesn't
want to speak to you!

750
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:24.340 line:82%
Stay out of it, man!
This is between us!

751
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:26.630 line:82%
Sir, please!

752
00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.000 line:82%
-Hands off!
-Or else?

753
00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:29.760 line:82%
Stop it! Stop it!

754
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:34.080 line:82%
Stop it!

755
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.050 line:82%
I love you, Alizeh...

756
00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.670 line:82%
Come on, Alizeh.

757
00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:48.630 line:82%
I know I made mistakes, but
how much longer will you punish me...

758
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:55.170 line:82%
You can't just cut me out
of your life after all these years...

759
01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.970 line:82%
Come on, let's go.

760
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.760 line:82%
Alizeh, please give me a chance.

761
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.420 line:82%
Ayan...

762
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.040 line:82%
Go.

763
01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.010 line:82%
Go.

764
01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.760 line:82%
Okay, I'm right here... I'll wait...

765
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.170 line:82%
No, Ayan,

766
01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.010 line:82%
go.

767
01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.180 line:82%
To London?

768
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:39.670 line:82%
Alizeh, the plane
won't come back for you.

769
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.420 line:82%
I'll find my way.

770
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:46.860 line:82%
Okay...

771
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:51.970 line:82%
Take care.

772
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:21.150 line:82%
Ever been suddenly slapped?

773
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.090 line:82%
That's love.

774
01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:29.840 line:82%
And it only hits you harder,
when there's someone else involved.

775
01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.670 line:82%
Why is there ever someone else?

776
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.160 line:82%
-Hello?
-Ayan?

777
01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:50.290 line:82%
Alizeh! Hi!

778
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.210 line:82%
Where are you?

779
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:56.660 line:82%
Where are you?
I've been calling you for days!

780
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:00.370 line:82%
Please leave a message
after the tone.

781
01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.460 line:82%
Please leave a message...
Even your voicemail's full!

782
01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.500 line:82%
I am unable to reach you over
the phone. Where are you?

783
01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.830 line:82%
In Lucknow...

784
01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.790 line:82%
Lucknow... why?

785
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.830 line:82%
I'm here with Ali.

786
01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.910 line:82%
Ali... Right...

787
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:17.200 line:82%
Same flight.

788
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:19.410 line:82%
Passenger seat.

789
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.560 line:82%
Together... Same plane?

790
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:25.500 line:82%
What are you saying?
I'm with Ali.

791
01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.610 line:82%
Did you sleep with him?

792
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:28.950 line:82%
Ayan! What?

793
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.910 line:82%
Don't lie to me...

794
01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.260 line:82%
I know you had sex with him.

795
01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:34.410 line:82%
He's your lover now...

796
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:35.780 line:82%
Boyfriend...

797
01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.910 line:82%
Back together.

798
01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.750 line:82%
Are you drunk?

799
01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.200 line:82%
You're the one who's drunk!

800
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:44.580 line:82%
You said you never
wanted to see him again!

801
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.810 line:82%
I know, Ayan...

802
01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.020 line:82%
But people in love are liars.

803
01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.440 line:82%
This isn't love... it's weakness!

804
01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.810 line:82%
Ali's my weakness.

805
01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:01.760 line:82%
Alizeh, he's going to leave you.

806
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:04.480 line:82%
Then don't call me...
I'm very busy!

807
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:07.000 line:82%
I know you're being protective.

808
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.520 line:82%
You're a goddamn fraud!

809
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.150 line:82%
Fake! Liar!

810
01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:13.560 line:82%
You can say what you want...

811
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.850 line:82%
But I love him.

812
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:20.230 line:82%
I can't help it.
I really love him.

813
01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:22.770 line:82%
He's very sorry.

814
01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.890 line:82%
He even cried!

815
01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.650 line:82%
But, Alizeh, I cry all the time.

816
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.980 line:82%
Where do you fit
in to all of this?

817
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.360 line:82%
Yeah...

818
01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:32.270 line:82%
What does it have to do with me?

819
01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:35.190 line:82%
Ayan, listen... It's important.

820
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.400 line:82%
Ali's going on tour for a year...
and he wants me to go with him.

821
01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.310 line:82%
He wants to marry me and...

822
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.310 line:82%
he proposed.

823
01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.190 line:82%
What did you say?

824
01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.980 line:82%
Yes, what else?

825
01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.530 line:82%
Mum and Dad have kicked me out,

826
01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.900 line:82%
they won't come for
the wedding, either.

827
01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.970 line:82%
Some of Ali's useless cousins
will be at the wedding.

828
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.850 line:82%
Will you come from my side...
For me?

829
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.060 line:82%
I don't have a visa.

830
01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:11.190 line:82%
Yo, Mr. Britain!
I'll organize all of that.

831
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:13.960 line:82%
So... You'll come?

832
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.850 line:82%
Hello? Ayan?

833
01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.990 line:82%
Ayan?

834
01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.730 line:82%
Of course I will!

835
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.730 line:82%
Thank you, man.

836
01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.020 line:82%
Dude, I love you.

837
01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:27.900 line:82%
Say congratulations!

838
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.100 line:82%
Hi, bro!

839
01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:21.900 line:82%
Alizeh...

840
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:23.520 line:82%
Weds...

841
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560 line:82%
Ayan!

842
01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:05.770 line:82%
Ayan!
You're spinning like a top!

843
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:06.940 line:82%
You're seriously like Mohd. Rafi!

844
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.150 line:82%
I was wrong about you, man!

845
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:12.150 line:82%
You really can sing!

846
01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:19.440 line:82%
Forget this MBA...
Follow your dreams!

847
01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:22.150 line:82%
Not like you can't afford to!

848
01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.770 line:82%
Today you sang with such...

849
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.060 line:82%
Pain?

850
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:37.520 line:82%
Love?

851
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.220 line:82%
Ayan...

852
01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.020 line:82%
Tell me, Alizeh...

853
01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:45.770 line:82%
did I sing with love today?

854
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:50.600 line:82%
Who was it for?

855
01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:56.020 line:82%
Who was it for...

856
01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.440 line:82%
Should I tell you?

857
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.050 line:82%
-No...
-But you must know.

858
01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:04.350 line:82%
I love you, Alizeh.

859
01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.520 line:82%
I love you.

860
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:10.400 line:82%
I'm madly in love with you.

861
01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:17.310 line:82%
And now, it's too late...

862
01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:28.770 line:82%
Now, I want that DJ Ali
to die in the wedding procession.

863
01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:32.600 line:82%
And from that shock,
I want you to die, too.

864
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.350 line:82%
If I can't have you, no one can.

865
01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:40.150 line:82%
Ayan...

866
01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.450 line:82%
Ayan... Please...

867
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:45.020 line:82%
Please, Ayan!

868
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:49.900 line:82%
You want to know what it feels like?

869
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.020 line:82%
I'll show you.

870
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.730 line:82%
Ayan!

871
01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.160 line:82%
-Alizeh...
-Ayan...

872
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:04.020 line:82%
Alizeh...

873
01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.070 line:82%
Alizeh...

874
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:06.440 line:82%
Alizeh...

875
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:07.560 line:82%
Alizeh...

876
01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:08.650 line:82%
Alizeh...

877
01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.760 line:82%
Alizeh...

878
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:10.830 line:82%
Alizeh...

879
01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.100 line:82%
Alizeh!

880
01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:22.520 line:82%
May death do you'll part, Mrs. DJ Ali.

881
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.060 line:82%
Have a great life.

882
01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:28.020 line:82%
It's all good.

883
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:59.160 line:82%
May I sit here?

884
01:15:59.370 --> 01:16:01.200 line:82%
My wife's sitting there.

885
01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.040 line:82%
I don't see anyone.

886
01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.040 line:82%
Excuse me, ma'am...

887
01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:13.830 line:82%
May I sit there?

888
01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:18.580 line:82%
Yeah, sure.

889
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.990 line:82%
Thank you.

890
01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.200 line:82%
Hello!

891
01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.110 line:82%
Hello.

892
01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:30.540 line:82%
Grapes?

893
01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:39.660 line:82%
There are a lot of empty seats...

894
01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.160 line:82%
But I don't want to be alone.

895
01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:50.700 line:82%
I was at a wedding.

896
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:52.330 line:82%
My best friend's wedding!

897
01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.910 line:82%
I left that halfway.

898
01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:58.950 line:82%
Book or the wedding?

899
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:02.370 line:82%
Both.

900
01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.700 line:82%
British Passport!

901
01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:11.580 line:82%
British Passport!

902
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:15.120 line:82%
I was born in England. You too?

903
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:18.240 line:82%
Same pinch...

904
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:22.240 line:82%
I'm on my way to
Frankfurt... Via Dubai.

905
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:24.760 line:82%
You?

906
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:26.120 line:82%
Vienna.

907
01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:27.870 line:82%
Via Dubai?

908
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:31.910 line:82%
Same pinch!

909
01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:37.580 line:82%
So what's up?
What do you do?

910
01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.870 line:82%
Write.

911
01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:44.280 line:82%
Nice to meet you, Ms. Wright.
I'm Ayan.

912
01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:46.620 line:82%
I write poetry.

913
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:48.740 line:82%
My name is Saba.

914
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.700 line:82%
Oh!

915
01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.950 line:82%
Too good...

916
01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.530 line:82%
We'll chat on the flight.

917
01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.740 line:82%
Wait 'til you hear
some of my stories.

918
01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:07.410 line:82%
What's up?

919
01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:11.200 line:82%
Chatter is a fool's pursuit.

920
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:15.910 line:82%
Your eyes can't hide
what your words conceal.

921
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.130 line:82%
Why hide your tears?

922
01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.030 line:82%
Don't imprison them.

923
01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:33.080 line:82%
Let them be free.

924
01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.580 line:82%
I'm very sad.

925
01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:23.280 line:82%
-That's me.
-That's me.

926
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.450 line:82%
Listen, it was really
amazing meeting you.

927
01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:27.770 line:82%
Thanks for listening.

928
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.860 line:82%
And sorry... I think...
I fell asleep, talking.

929
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:32.650 line:82%
Well, you were even
talking in your sleep...

930
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.280 line:82%
Shit! What did I say?

931
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:35.600 line:82%
Relax.

932
01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:40.240 line:82%
Ayan...

933
01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.870 line:82%
I know words can't always
heal scars that run so deep...

934
01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.080 line:82%
But words are all I have.

935
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.740 line:82%
So here, this is for you!

936
01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.370 line:82%
I hope it helps a little.

937
01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:55.240 line:82%
And if words aren't your thing,

938
01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.330 line:82%
maybe the number will help.

939
01:19:58.650 --> 01:19:59.950 line:82%
Have a nice flight.

940
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:03.080 line:82%
Thank you! Same to you!

941
01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:21.390 line:82%
"When you miss your lover,

942
01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.610 line:82%
when you suffer alone in agony,

943
01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.990 line:82%
when your tears aren't
accompanied by a smile,

944
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:27.850 line:82%
when your lips can't find words,

945
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:30.680 line:82%
when you are merely existing,

946
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.510 line:82%
when the mornings are gloomy,

947
01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.920 line:82%
when you wait indefinitely,

948
01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.170 line:82%
when you miss that idiot,

949
01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.540 line:82%
why do I take this path when
he is not meant to be mine?

950
01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.280 line:82%
My heart has given up.

951
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.720 line:82%
Love is complicated."

952
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:06.700 line:82%
People always say
heart over mind.

953
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:09.370 line:82%
But when the heart breaks...

954
01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.420 line:82%
shouldn't you follow your mind?

955
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.240 line:82%
Hello?

956
01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:28.410 line:82%
Chatter is a fool's
pursuit... or so I've heard.

957
01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.780 line:82%
But old habits die hard.

958
01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:34.490 line:82%
I've been rather
impatient for this call.

959
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:40.870 line:82%
Hello?

960
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.160 line:82%
Sorry, my cheeks are turning pink...

961
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:46.240 line:82%
You make me blush.

962
01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:49.700 line:82%
It's true, though.

963
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:53.280 line:82%
You've told me
everything about you,

964
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.870 line:82%
and you know nothing about me.

965
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:59.780 line:82%
-Why do you think I'm here?
-Where?

966
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:01.780 line:82%
Vienna...

967
01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:04.450 line:82%
What are you doing here?

968
01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.330 line:82%
Crossed the boundary
to cross some boundaries.

969
01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.660 line:82%
That's tough...

970
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:13.490 line:82%
I can handle tough.

971
01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:17.280 line:82%
Get to work, then.
See you tonight at 8?

972
01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:18.440 line:82%
I'll send you the address...

973
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:20.160 line:82%
Okay... Of your house, right?

974
01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.580 line:82%
You wish.

975
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.130 line:82%
Good morning.

976
01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:10.200 line:82%
Morning.

977
01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.700 line:82%
Slept well?

978
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:12.990 line:82%
Hmm...

979
01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:16.630 line:82%
I made breakfast for myself,
I hope you don't mind...

980
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:19.740 line:82%
I'd have made you some,

981
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.200 line:82%
but I didn't know
what you'd like.

982
01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:24.580 line:82%
You know nothing about me.

983
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.730 line:82%
I got to know quite
a bit last night.

984
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.740 line:82%
Passion isn't familiarity.

985
01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:33.990 line:82%
I'm blushing again.

986
01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:37.120 line:82%
Change of topic!

987
01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:39.330 line:82%
I read some of your poetry...

988
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:42.370 line:82%
It's beautiful.

989
01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:50.620 line:82%
Glad you liked them.

990
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:54.580 line:82%
I don't get much
appreciation for my poetry.

991
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.700 line:82%
There's so much angst
in your poems.

992
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:03.200 line:82%
Angst will always find angst.

993
01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:05.830 line:82%
Can I steal it for my music?

994
01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.940 line:82%
Careful.
I have an excellent lawyer.

995
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:12.330 line:82%
He didn't even spare
my ex-husband!

996
01:26:12.670 --> 01:26:14.200 line:82%
Divorced!

997
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:15.910 line:82%
Why so pleased?

998
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.740 line:82%
Of course!
You're single...

999
01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:19.660 line:82%
Happily divorced...

1000
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.580 line:82%
and I have no regrets.

1001
01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:24.280 line:82%
Tahir and I are
very good friends.

1002
01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:27.280 line:82%
Every poetess should
marry at least once.

1003
01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:30.870 line:82%
A happy marriage means
a good life...

1004
01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:34.990 line:82%
an unhappy one means
good poetry!

1005
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:37.910 line:82%
By the way, I was kidding.

1006
01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.990 line:82%
If you need my poetry,
go ahead.

1007
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:43.240 line:82%
Thanks.

1008
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:45.780 line:82%
But what I need is you.

1009
01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.450 line:82%
I don't want to be needed...

1010
01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:51.780 line:82%
I want to be desired.

1011
01:26:58.470 --> 01:27:00.205 line:82%
You're relentless.

1012
01:27:00.696 --> 01:27:01.940 line:82%
Like a walking-talking Ghalib,

1013
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:03.530 line:82%
what am I supposed to say?

1014
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:07.120 line:82%
Your silence said
more than enough.

1015
01:27:08.110 --> 01:27:09.120 line:82%
Don't worry.

1016
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:12.030 line:82%
I have no room for
a relationship in my life.

1017
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:14.620 line:82%
Not anymore.

1018
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:18.700 line:82%
There's more than
one kind of relationship,

1019
01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:22.780 line:82%
but only if you're up for it.

1020
01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.780 line:82%
What are the rules like?

1021
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.910 line:82%
Easily broken.

1022
01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.530 line:82%
So you get my poetry.

1023
01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:37.080 line:82%
The chance to drown your sorrows.

1024
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:40.410 line:82%
What do I get?

1025
01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.120 line:82%
I thought I was enough.

1026
01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:46.620 line:82%
"I seek the truth that
pierces the darkest night...

1027
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:51.200 line:82%
I seek the devotion
I surrendered in your stead...

1028
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:54.240 line:82%
I have known the virtue
that surrender proffers...

1029
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:58.060 line:82%
But I seek that heaven
for which I have bled."

1030
01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.720 line:82%
Is this supposed to be good?

1031
01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:08.830 line:82%
I don't get it.

1032
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:12.920 line:82%
Didn't you say he was world famous?

1033
01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:14.830 line:82%
He is.

1034
01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:18.670 line:82%
People really admire his work.

1035
01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.960 line:82%
And you?

1036
01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.920 line:82%
You're awkward.

1037
01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:29.870 line:82%
A little.

1038
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:36.250 line:82%
You can leave, if you like...

1039
01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:38.620 line:82%
And leave you alone with him?

1040
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:40.870 line:82%
No way.

1041
01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.000 line:82%
I'm dying to meet your ex-husband.

1042
01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.120 line:82%
How come?

1043
01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:51.620 line:82%
Just...

1044
01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:57.120 line:82%
-Tahir.
-Hi.

1045
01:33:58.790 --> 01:34:02.370 line:82%
Your Facebook tells me
too many things have changed...

1046
01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.170 line:82%
Like the colour of your walls,

1047
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.620 line:82%
and the claim to your heart.

1048
01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.250 line:82%
Ayan. Tahir.

1049
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:10.740 line:82%
Fantastic work, sir!

1050
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:13.000 line:82%
Sir? Really? Sir?

1051
01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:16.170 line:82%
Are you trying to
make me sound old?

1052
01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:19.540 line:82%
By the way, he doesn't
call you ma'am, does he?

1053
01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:21.420 line:82%
-You think?
-I don't know!

1054
01:34:23.670 --> 01:34:27.310 line:82%
So you're the one...
who's keeping her up at night.

1055
01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:29.830 line:82%
Why waste time on sleep?

1056
01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:33.250 line:82%
Sleep is critical...

1057
01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:36.170 line:82%
for her to dream about me?

1058
01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:37.800 line:82%
Oh, now I definitely
won't let her sleep.

1059
01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:39.500 line:82%
I can't see this...

1060
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.920 line:82%
Change of topic!

1061
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:43.150 line:82%
Yes!

1062
01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:47.330 line:82%
Besides, you've fulfilled
your dreams.

1063
01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:50.160 line:82%
Your new work is very interesting.

1064
01:34:50.290 --> 01:34:52.000 line:82%
Actually, fantastic!

1065
01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:57.830 line:82%
Without a lover in his arms,
what else is a man to do?

1066
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:02.790 line:82%
-Do you guys rehearse these lines?
-No, totally natural!

1067
01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.210 line:82%
Ah, natural...

1068
01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.920 line:82%
People often shroud
their fear with words.

1069
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:14.540 line:82%
Our relationship
may have changed,

1070
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:17.250 line:82%
but the fear remains.

1071
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:19.370 line:82%
Why did it change...

1072
01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:20.980 line:82%
if I may ask?

1073
01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.920 line:82%
Maybe you should
be asking the person...

1074
01:35:24.210 --> 01:35:26.290 line:82%
whose nights are now yours.

1075
01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.420 line:82%
People often falter...

1076
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:33.000 line:82%
on the slippery slopes
of relationships.

1077
01:35:33.670 --> 01:35:34.830 line:82%
Yeah.

1078
01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:39.620 line:82%
You could have shown
me a better way.

1079
01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:43.540 line:82%
Let the one who is lost,
find his own way.

1080
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:51.530 line:82%
I hate you.

1081
01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:54.250 line:82%
A little... no, a lot.

1082
01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.990 line:82%
Such hatred... so soon?
Give me a chance...

1083
01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:00.790 line:82%
Hating you is
completely justified...

1084
01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:04.080 line:82%
Because I still love Saba.

1085
01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:08.790 line:82%
I gave your love a chance.

1086
01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:12.250 line:82%
It's time for you to
give my friendship a chance.

1087
01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:14.960 line:82%
Isn't that hard?

1088
01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.310 line:82%
What?

1089
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:20.500 line:82%
To love someone...
who doesn't love you in return?

1090
01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:28.790 line:82%
It's the most beautiful
feeling in the world.

1091
01:36:31.290 --> 01:36:34.170 line:82%
-Doesn't it make you feel weak?
-Not at all.

1092
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:38.580 line:82%
There's nothing like
the power of unrequited love...

1093
01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:42.540 line:82%
Unlike other bonds,
it isn't shared.

1094
01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.670 line:82%
It's mine...
and mine alone.

1095
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.220 line:82%
For a love like this,
I don't need Saba to love her.

1096
01:36:55.570 --> 01:36:57.790 line:82%
There's no better love than that.

1097
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:03.580 line:82%
"If you gamble in
the name of love...

1098
01:37:04.290 --> 01:37:07.080 line:82%
Stake what you like...
what's to fear?

1099
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:10.120 line:82%
How wonderful if you win...

1100
01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:14.839 line:82%
Even if you lose...
all is not lost."

1101
01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.870 line:82%
Don't hang up!

1102
01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:11.330 line:82%
Hello?

1103
01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.400 line:82%
Hello?

1104
01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:13.500 line:82%
Shit!

1105
01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:31.920 line:82%
-Hello?
-Ayan!

1106
01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.040 line:82%
Where the hell are you?

1107
01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:36.990 line:82%
I've been trying to call you forever!

1108
01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.530 line:82%
You blocked my number!

1109
01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.830 line:82%
What did you think I'd do?

1110
01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.210 line:82%
Walk you down the aisle?

1111
01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.080 line:82%
Did you marry him?

1112
01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:46.160 line:82%
Yeah... I did.

1113
01:38:46.210 --> 01:38:47.620 line:82%
Congratulations!

1114
01:38:48.710 --> 01:38:51.170 line:82%
Now you're Mrs. DJ Ali!

1115
01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:54.500 line:82%
Must be stuck on
him like headphones...

1116
01:38:55.230 --> 01:38:57.370 line:82%
Ayan, stop your crap
before I hang up.

1117
01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:00.000 line:82%
Hello!
You don't scare me!

1118
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.330 line:82%
Control yourself!

1119
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:03.500 line:82%
I have a girlfriend now.

1120
01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:06.870 line:82%
She's really hot!

1121
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:08.530 line:82%
And she writes poetry.

1122
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.250 line:82%
You'll never get it!

1123
01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:13.620 line:82%
Are you jealous?

1124
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.330 line:82%
I think you're jealous.

1125
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.870 line:82%
No, dude...

1126
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:25.830 line:82%
I'm just really glad you called.

1127
01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.590 line:82%
I'm so happy!

1128
01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:35.250 line:82%
I have to go back
to my dinner date now.

1129
01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:39.500 line:82%
Candlelit... Romantic!

1130
01:39:39.730 --> 01:39:41.750 line:82%
Ayan, listen...

1131
01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.620 line:82%
I really missed you.

1132
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:48.000 line:82%
I hate you.

1133
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.500 line:82%
Okay.
But I missed you.

1134
01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:55.730 line:82%
Bye.

1135
01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.580 line:82%
This is Saba. My girlfriend.

1136
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.710 line:82%
Wow.

1137
01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:22.870 line:82%
What's she doing with you?

1138
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.160 line:82%
She's gorgeous!

1139
01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:26.660 line:82%
Yeah... Way better than you.

1140
01:40:27.130 --> 01:40:28.580 line:82%
-Like it's a competition!
-Of course it is!

1141
01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:32.850 line:82%
Is DJ Ali still handsome
or did my curses work?

1142
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.330 line:82%
My prayers worked!

1143
01:40:34.690 --> 01:40:35.830 line:82%
Are you happy?

1144
01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:41.040 line:82%
Yeah. I'm happy.

1145
01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:44.460 line:82%
Feels like I'm finally
a part of Ali's life.

1146
01:40:45.170 --> 01:40:47.540 line:82%
Our lives are wrapped in luggage.

1147
01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:51.120 line:82%
And hotel rooms are home.

1148
01:40:53.210 --> 01:40:54.420 line:82%
But it's nice.

1149
01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.370 line:82%
There's the occasional
dark cloud,

1150
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.170 line:82%
but other than that,
the sun is always shining.

1151
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:06.500 line:82%
I'm really, really happy.

1152
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:09.450 line:82%
I hate you.

1153
01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.370 line:82%
I'm coming to Vienna!

1154
01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:25.790 line:82%
What plans?

1155
01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.260 line:82%
I'm very busy.

1156
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:30.390 line:82%
Meetings, appointments...

1157
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.000 line:82%
Shuddap! You're free!

1158
01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:33.500 line:82%
Okay, I am!

1159
01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:36.750 line:82%
Saba and I would
love to host you,

1160
01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:39.080 line:82%
but leave that DJ Ali behind.

1161
01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:41.960 line:82%
He has a concert,
anyway... I'll be there!

1162
01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.330 line:82%
-Hi!
-Hi!

1163
01:41:59.750 --> 01:42:02.580 line:82%
You're dying to wait
by the window.

1164
01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:06.040 line:82%
Check if she called.
Walk around restlessly.

1165
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:09.080 line:82%
You're not fooling
anyone with this pose.

1166
01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.410 line:82%
What? Me? Why?
I'm totally chill...

1167
01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:12.790 line:82%
I'm cool!

1168
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:15.540 line:82%
Someone's at the door.

1169
01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:18.330 line:82%
Go... She's here.

1170
01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:25.580 line:82%
Hi!

1171
01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:26.710 line:82%
Ayan!

1172
01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.500 line:82%
Hi... Cold outside?

1173
01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:30.830 line:82%
What are you doing?

1174
01:42:31.130 --> 01:42:33.080 line:82%
Didn't bring any wine?
Flowers? Thorns? Nothing?

1175
01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:34.160 line:82%
Should I have?

1176
01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:35.420 line:82%
Saba!

1177
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:36.970 line:82%
Alizeh.

1178
01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:39.580 line:82%
-Welcome home.
-Thank you.

1179
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:41.320 line:82%
-So, Alizeh...
-So nice to good to see you.

1180
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:44.080 line:82%
Heard so much about you.
All good things, I hope!

1181
01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:46.690 line:82%
What?

1182
01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:50.460 line:82%
No... just... trying to
ease the tension!

1183
01:42:50.710 --> 01:42:51.950 line:82%
Get a hold on yourself...

1184
01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.870 line:82%
The tension will disappear.
Come.

1185
01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.700 line:82%
-You know how girls can be!
-Sexist remark.

1186
01:42:57.830 --> 01:43:00.170 line:82%
-Not appreciated!
-Not at all!

1187
01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.540 line:82%
Give our intelligence its due!

1188
01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.160 line:82%
Wine?

1189
01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:08.450 line:82%
Maybe later...

1190
01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:09.620 line:82%
Ah, okay...

1191
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:10.870 line:82%
But, Saba...

1192
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.920 line:82%
Beauty like yours often
overshadows intelligence.

1193
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:18.170 line:82%
Ask those of us who
live off our personality.

1194
01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.250 line:82%
Beauty fades, Alizeh.

1195
01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:23.080 line:82%
But Death, himself,
can't kill personality.

1196
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:26.960 line:82%
Wow... So the poetry
really was yours!

1197
01:43:27.210 --> 01:43:31.370 line:82%
I thought Ayan was just
copying it off the internet!

1198
01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:34.710 line:82%
If it weren't for poetry...

1199
01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.540 line:82%
I'd have died a thousand
living deaths already.

1200
01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:40.460 line:82%
Cheese?

1201
01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:48.210 line:82%
Will I sound phony
if I praise you some more?

1202
01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.790 line:82%
Not at all.
Please go ahead.

1203
01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.210 line:82%
No judgments.

1204
01:43:52.710 --> 01:43:54.380 line:82%
Pictures do you no justice...

1205
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:56.620 line:82%
You're even more
beautiful in person.

1206
01:43:58.810 --> 01:44:02.330 line:82%
Oh, so those pictures
were to show you...

1207
01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.420 line:82%
To make her jealous...

1208
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:07.830 line:82%
but why waste
envy on the resentful?

1209
01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:09.250 line:82%
Wow, Ayan.

1210
01:44:09.630 --> 01:44:11.170 line:82%
Saba, looks like you've
had an influence.

1211
01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.290 line:82%
A little bit of it.

1212
01:44:12.370 --> 01:44:13.580 line:82%
A little to go.

1213
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:19.210 line:82%
Well, it's not envy...

1214
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.910 line:82%
But you can't sing
to a mute person,

1215
01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.790 line:82%
and expect them
not to feel inferior!

1216
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:30.120 line:82%
Speaking of singing.
This is my favourite song.

1217
01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:34.170 line:82%
"O lover, don't ask me
to love like I did before..."

1218
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:37.270 line:82%
"O lover, don't ask me..."

1219
01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:38.960 line:82%
"To love like I did before."

1220
01:44:49.210 --> 01:44:50.250 line:82%
Dinner?

1221
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:51.580 line:82%
Bread?

1222
01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:53.750 line:82%
-No, thank you.
-Sure?

1223
01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:56.490 line:82%
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1224
01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:59.080 line:82%
Why didn't you bring Ali?

1225
01:45:00.210 --> 01:45:02.660 line:82%
He had a concert, so...

1226
01:45:02.710 --> 01:45:04.540 line:82%
DJ Ali's super busy, you see...

1227
01:45:06.230 --> 01:45:09.330 line:82%
Why do you keep calling him that?
Like it's an insult...

1228
01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:10.750 line:82%
Not at all!

1229
01:45:11.170 --> 01:45:14.169 line:82%
Who doesn't dream of making
people dance on their fingertips?

1230
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:19.330 line:82%
Alizeh, may I ask
you something personal?

1231
01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.210 line:82%
If you don't mind...

1232
01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.870 line:82%
Sure.

1233
01:45:24.370 --> 01:45:28.170 line:82%
How did you not fall in love
with someone so charming?

1234
01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:36.120 line:82%
Charming for you, maybe...

1235
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:38.800 line:82%
He was a big baby
when I met him...

1236
01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:43.570 line:82%
He cried on the streets,
cried in my arms...

1237
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:45.040 line:82%
Really?

1238
01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:49.290 line:82%
Ayan... Is this a compliment
or a slight?

1239
01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:51.540 line:82%
You've never cried in my arms.

1240
01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:55.000 line:82%
How could I cry in your arms...

1241
01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:58.870 line:82%
when I'm so distracted by
my other feelings.

1242
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:44.670 line:82%
You got lucky, Ayan!

1243
01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.790 line:82%
Saba's wonderful.

1244
01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.420 line:82%
Anyway...

1245
01:46:57.090 --> 01:46:58.670 line:82%
-Thank you for dinner.
-Go to hell!

1246
01:46:59.330 --> 01:47:01.250 line:82%
"Thank you for dinner?"

1247
01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:05.040 line:82%
You're soulless!

1248
01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.380 line:82%
Don't you have any feelings?

1249
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.080 line:82%
Not jealousy, not guilt...

1250
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:13.480 line:82%
-Nothing?
-I feel everything, Ayan.

1251
01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:16.000 line:82%
But you'd never
understand if I told you...

1252
01:47:16.130 --> 01:47:17.630 line:82%
You'd just misconstrue it all!

1253
01:47:19.130 --> 01:47:20.670 line:82%
You're a goddamn child!

1254
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:22.420 line:82%
You've got everything!

1255
01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.290 line:82%
Goals, passion,
a relationship...

1256
01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:26.510 line:82%
Why are you still so stubborn?

1257
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:27.650 line:82%
Because I am!

1258
01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:29.670 line:82%
I'm stubborn
because it's my heart!

1259
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.500 line:82%
What are you going
to do about it?

1260
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:41.630 line:82%
Why can't you love me?

1261
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.160 line:82%
I do love you, Ayan...

1262
01:47:50.650 --> 01:47:53.380 line:82%
Just not the way
you want me to.

1263
01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.170 line:82%
Why?

1264
01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:00.380 line:82%
I can't... Please...

1265
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:13.250 line:82%
-I don't want to be selfish, Ayan--
-Get lost.

1266
01:48:55.170 --> 01:48:56.250 line:82%
It's over, Ayan.

1267
01:48:58.870 --> 01:49:00.080 line:82%
It's over.

1268
01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.290 line:82%
I lied...

1269
01:49:19.330 --> 01:49:20.670 line:82%
First to you...

1270
01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.500 line:82%
then to myself.

1271
01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:32.000 line:82%
I lied that I don't
have place for love...

1272
01:49:40.210 --> 01:49:43.880 line:82%
I'm falling in love
with you, Ayan.

1273
01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:51.170 line:82%
And today, I finally understood
that you can never love me...

1274
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:53.960 line:82%
the way you love Alizeh...

1275
01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.330 line:82%
And still...

1276
01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:01.830 line:82%
I love you...

1277
01:50:08.250 --> 01:50:09.420 line:82%
What do I do?

1278
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:12.960 line:82%
Saba, you've always known...

1279
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:17.630 line:82%
I can't do this, Ayan.

1280
01:50:20.250 --> 01:50:23.380 line:82%
I've been down this road.

1281
01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.500 line:82%
It's broken me once before.

1282
01:50:28.630 --> 01:50:29.630 line:82%
Saba...

1283
01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:35.130 line:82%
Please don't try to
change my mind...

1284
01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:39.380 line:82%
If you try...

1285
01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:43.460 line:82%
I'll give in...

1286
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:47.460 line:82%
If I give in...

1287
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:52.170 line:82%
I'll fall apart again.

1288
01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:59.500 line:82%
We can't choose who
to fall in love with...

1289
01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:07.380 line:82%
but we can choose
when to walk away.

1290
01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:11.040 line:82%
Go, Ayan...

1291
01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:13.330 line:82%
Go...

1292
01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.710 line:82%
Let me go.

1293
01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:39.670 line:82%
Please.

1294
01:52:41.130 --> 01:52:43.460 line:82%
Please... let me go.

1295
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:48.670 line:82%
I can't go on like this...

1296
01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.380 line:82%
So I have to go, okay?

1297
01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.380 line:82%
Okay?

1298
01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:02.170 line:82%
I have to go...

1299
01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:09.290 line:82%
If I can't do it,

1300
01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:11.460 line:82%
then you have to be
the stronger one.

1301
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:13.500 line:82%
Okay?

1302
01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:18.170 line:82%
-Okay?
-Okay...

1303
01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:10.580 line:82%
Thanks...
Good job on the mix!

1304
01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.080 line:82%
Thanks.

1305
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:34.000 line:82%
Hey, Ayan!

1306
01:59:35.170 --> 01:59:36.790 line:82%
-Hey, Ali!
-What's up, man?

1307
01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:40.000 line:82%
-Avoiding me?
-Avoid... no.

1308
01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:41.880 line:82%
Congratulations.
You sang really well.

1309
01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:43.040 line:82%
Thanks.

1310
01:59:44.150 --> 01:59:45.200 line:82%
Looks like you're doing well.

1311
01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:48.380 line:82%
Well, I couldn't be
Mohammad Rafi...

1312
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:51.000 line:82%
but I've found some
love on the internet.

1313
01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:52.540 line:82%
Great.

1314
01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:56.130 line:82%
-All good, otherwise?
-Yeah, all good... Superb.

1315
02:00:01.130 --> 02:00:02.290 line:82%
Sorry.

1316
02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:04.710 line:82%
I'm finding this
formality really funny.

1317
02:00:06.210 --> 02:00:09.420 line:82%
The truth is that I'd been
hoping to run into you...

1318
02:00:09.690 --> 02:00:11.250 line:82%
so I could beat you up.

1319
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.250 line:82%
You have no idea how much
I wanted to beat you up, DJ Ali!

1320
02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:19.160 line:82%
Nice.

1321
02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:21.080 line:82%
Why'd you feel that way?

1322
02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.830 line:82%
Because of how you felt.

1323
02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:28.460 line:82%
Your love was so strong that
mine couldn't live up to it.

1324
02:00:29.250 --> 02:00:31.040 line:82%
What else have
I ever done...

1325
02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:33.710 line:82%
Sang some songs...
and fell in love.

1326
02:00:35.210 --> 02:00:36.540 line:82%
You're fortunate.

1327
02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:40.710 line:82%
Not everyone can love
so faithfully...

1328
02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:45.080 line:82%
How's Alizeh doing?

1329
02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.540 line:82%
You're serious?
You don't know?

1330
02:00:54.170 --> 02:00:55.540 line:82%
I don't know... what?

1331
02:00:58.690 --> 02:01:00.080 line:82%
Congratulations, man.

1332
02:01:00.330 --> 02:01:01.630 line:82%
She left me.

1333
02:01:10.110 --> 02:01:12.580 line:82%
Maybe I couldn't love
her the way she wanted me to.

1334
02:01:13.670 --> 02:01:15.290 line:82%
I haven't seen her in two years.

1335
02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:18.630 line:82%
Even her parents
haven't heard from her.

1336
02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:23.250 line:82%
Last I heard, she was in London,
but I don't have the details...

1337
02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:26.210 line:82%
Why didn't she call you?

1338
02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:46.710 line:82%
Everyone knows love is crooked...

1339
02:01:47.290 --> 02:01:49.710 line:82%
But to find peace
in that crooked love...

1340
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.580 line:82%
is a gift only few have.

1341
02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:53.500 line:82%
This?

1342
02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:55.380 line:82%
This is my happy place!

1343
02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:58.710 line:82%
And when there's nothing left...

1344
02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:02.250 line:82%
they find shelter
in that crookedness.

1345
02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:06.380 line:82%
I come here when the
world gets too much...

1346
02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:08.670 line:82%
Crooked love.

1347
02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:11.960 line:82%
When I want to spend
time with myself,

1348
02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:16.330 line:82%
because this is the only
place on earth that knows

1349
02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:18.170 line:82%
that love is crooked.

1350
02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:19.890 line:82%
Crooked.

1351
02:03:36.590 --> 02:03:37.610 line:82%
Ayan?

1352
02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:42.670 line:82%
Ayan?

1353
02:03:52.210 --> 02:03:53.250 line:82%
Hi!

1354
02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:07.290 line:82%
Where have you been?

1355
02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:09.330 line:82%
Where the hell were you?

1356
02:04:12.450 --> 02:04:13.960 line:82%
Where the hell were you?

1357
02:04:14.290 --> 02:04:17.040 line:82%
No one has a clue
where you are...

1358
02:04:17.710 --> 02:04:19.130 line:82%
Who are you?

1359
02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:22.330 line:82%
-Ayan..
-Malaysian Airlines?

1360
02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:25.710 line:82%
You think it'll make a
difference if you disappear?

1361
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:29.200 line:82%
I've been lying here for
2 days like a homeless man...

1362
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:31.000 line:82%
I'm frozen through!

1363
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:34.210 line:82%
This is the cone and
this is the ice cream!

1364
02:04:35.130 --> 02:04:37.910 line:82%
Haven't eaten, haven't slept...
Not used the loo for any business!

1365
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.910 line:82%
What if you'd showed up?

1366
02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:42.080 line:82%
-Where the hell were you?
-Slap you!

1367
02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.710 line:82%
Why'd you shave your head?

1368
02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.580 line:82%
Why are you bald?

1369
02:04:57.540 --> 02:04:59.040 line:82%
I'm dying, you idiot!

1370
02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:04.570 line:82%
Means?

1371
02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:10.250 line:82%
What?

1372
02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:12.610 line:82%
Why did you shave your head?

1373
02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:14.750 line:82%
At least give me a hug!

1374
02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:25.380 line:82%
Dying means what?

1375
02:05:26.090 --> 02:05:27.670 line:82%
Dying means what?

1376
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:40.540 line:82%
Love is like cancer.

1377
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:43.580 line:82%
Comes without warning...

1378
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.040 line:82%
and destroys you in its wake.

1379
02:05:48.590 --> 02:05:50.500 line:82%
This can't be happening, Alizeh...

1380
02:05:53.670 --> 02:05:56.830 line:82%
Well... It's happened.

1381
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:05.540 line:82%
I thought I was so cool.

1382
02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:10.040 line:82%
Love turned me
into such a loser.

1383
02:06:13.710 --> 02:06:16.380 line:82%
Ali was making me act insane...

1384
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:19.750 line:82%
From checking his phone,
to following him around...

1385
02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:24.880 line:82%
I'd stopped being his wife
to act like a parole officer.

1386
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:29.130 line:82%
I can't even really complain.

1387
02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:34.920 line:82%
I was even willing
to overlook the cheating.

1388
02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:38.420 line:82%
Thankfully...

1389
02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:42.420 line:82%
I finally gathered the
last shreds of my dignity...

1390
02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:46.170 line:82%
and left him.

1391
02:06:47.010 --> 02:06:50.330 line:82%
I decided that my husband does
not control my self-worth.

1392
02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:53.420 line:82%
All that anger, hatred,

1393
02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.630 line:82%
balled up in my throat...

1394
02:06:58.790 --> 02:07:01.540 line:82%
I dismissed it as an
effect of the circumstance.

1395
02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:05.000 line:82%
The doctors called it cancer.

1396
02:07:05.210 --> 02:07:07.330 line:82%
Straight to 4th stage!

1397
02:07:08.330 --> 02:07:14.130 line:82%
I never even scored
that high in school, man!

1398
02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:18.130 line:82%
But look at you!

1399
02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:22.830 line:82%
You've gone from just
Ayan Sanger to Mr. Ayan Singer!

1400
02:07:26.130 --> 02:07:30.380 line:82%
If you even think of dying...
I'll kill you.

1401
02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:36.330 line:82%
Now that you're here...
I don't ever want to die.

1402
02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:25.000 line:82%
So, what will you have?

1403
02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:28.440 line:82%
Hi... Just some muesli
with strawberries, please.

1404
02:08:28.570 --> 02:08:31.070 line:82%
Muesli with strawberries...

1405
02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:32.980 line:82%
And how about you?

1406
02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:34.690 line:82%
Same!

1407
02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:36.480 line:82%
Okay!

1408
02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:50.480 line:82%
Oh, nothing.
Just donated my hair online.

1409
02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:53.400 line:82%
iBhakti.com?

1410
02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:57.320 line:82%
May this bald head shower
you with blessings.

1411
02:08:59.190 --> 02:09:00.190 line:82%
Cool.

1412
02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:14.480 line:82%
Seriously?

1413
02:09:15.490 --> 02:09:18.360 line:82%
You call that a reaction?
So low-key?

1414
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:23.650 line:82%
Alizeh, I just donated my hair... And
you're giving me an Irfan Khan stare?

1415
02:09:24.650 --> 02:09:26.820 line:82%
A little over-the-top won't hurt!

1416
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:29.610 line:82%
Ayan, have you gone nuts?

1417
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:32.230 line:82%
Take a look at yourself!

1418
02:09:33.670 --> 02:09:35.570 line:82%
You look hot, man!

1419
02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:37.070 line:82%
Hot!

1420
02:09:37.590 --> 02:09:40.950 line:82%
You'll be fighting girls off...
We'll have to call security!

1421
02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:45.230 line:82%
Seriously?

1422
02:09:46.940 --> 02:09:48.650 line:82%
-Really?
-Yeah!

1423
02:09:51.190 --> 02:09:53.630 line:82%
-Should I come there to try my luck?
-Come on over!

1424
02:09:57.760 --> 02:09:59.360 line:82%
You're mad!

1425
02:10:03.010 --> 02:10:05.110 line:82%
Goodbye, hairbrush!

1426
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:08.570 line:82%
Now, listen...

1427
02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:11.320 line:82%
I have no real religion...

1428
02:10:11.550 --> 02:10:13.230 line:82%
But I only believe in one religion.

1429
02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:15.250 line:82%
-Who?
-R.D. Burman's music!

1430
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:16.330 line:82%
Okay.

1431
02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:21.610 line:82%
If we both look like Captain Picard
anyway, let the Starship Enterprise fly!

1432
02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:25.900 line:82%
We're young, we're free
and we're ready

1433
02:10:26.150 --> 02:10:28.290 line:82%
to let the freak flag fly

1434
02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:30.730 line:82%
with Jolly Good Bollywood!

1435
02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:10.230 line:82%
Your tea, madam!

1436
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:13.690 line:82%
Careful, it's hot!

1437
02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.530 line:82%
-Did it burn you?
-A little...

1438
02:14:28.330 --> 02:14:29.900 line:82%
-Hi...
-Hi!

1439
02:14:51.590 --> 02:14:52.610 line:82%
Ayan...

1440
02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.150 line:82%
Sorry.

1441
02:15:06.630 --> 02:15:09.280 line:82%
Actually, sorry but I'm not sorry.

1442
02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:13.280 line:82%
What do you want from me?

1443
02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:15.940 line:82%
What do I do?

1444
02:15:17.170 --> 02:15:20.170 line:82%
You think I'm dying
to sleep with you...

1445
02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:26.320 line:82%
I'm dying for you to love me.

1446
02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:28.810 line:82%
I've tried everything...

1447
02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:32.370 line:82%
Staying away, staying close,
another relationship.

1448
02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:35.939 line:82%
But I can't...
I can't get you out of my head!

1449
02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:42.730 line:82%
What does DJ Ali have that I don't?

1450
02:15:44.230 --> 02:15:48.560 line:82%
If I get some tattoos
and start spouting poetry...

1451
02:15:48.690 --> 02:15:50.480 line:82%
Will you love me then?

1452
02:15:51.570 --> 02:15:55.730 line:82%
Will I finally be worthy of your love?

1453
02:15:56.410 --> 02:15:57.940 line:82%
Because I'll do it.

1454
02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:00.030 line:82%
I can do it.

1455
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:07.940 line:82%
I'm talking to you.

1456
02:16:08.930 --> 02:16:10.610 line:82%
Yeah, run away...

1457
02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:13.440 line:82%
Not like you have anything to say.

1458
02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:15.070 line:82%
Alizeh.

1459
02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:22.030 line:82%
-I can break things, too!
-That's a pressure cooker!

1460
02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:24.070 line:82%
Let it burst then!

1461
02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:27.150 line:82%
What do you want me to do?

1462
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:28.980 line:82%
-Lie to you?
-Yes, lie to me!

1463
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:31.490 line:82%
-I can't lie!
-Why not? You're dying, anyway!

1464
02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:34.170 line:82%
Live or die, I will not lie to you!

1465
02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:38.150 line:82%
This is the only honest thing
in my life, Ayan!

1466
02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.150 line:82%
Can't you love me
instead of DJ Ali?

1467
02:16:41.770 --> 02:16:43.730 line:82%
This is love, Ayan.

1468
02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:48.280 line:82%
-This isn't love.
-This is love for me, Ayan!

1469
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:52.200 line:82%
Ayan,
this is bigger than love...

1470
02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:55.200 line:82%
This is the greatest
love of my life.

1471
02:16:56.190 --> 02:16:57.840 line:82%
I don't want this kind of love.

1472
02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:02.310 line:82%
You're my friend...

1473
02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:04.480 line:82%
My family...

1474
02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:06.360 line:82%
My everything!

1475
02:17:06.610 --> 02:17:08.070 line:82%
You're just not my lover.

1476
02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:11.540 line:82%
Why not?
I can be your lover, too!

1477
02:17:11.670 --> 02:17:12.980 line:82%
Ayan!!

1478
02:17:13.670 --> 02:17:16.370 line:82%
That kind of love has only destroye me!
Do you want to be destroyed?

1479
02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:19.989 line:82%
Yes, I do.
I want to be destroyed.

1480
02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:24.400 line:82%
This thing we have between us...
Our friendship...

1481
02:17:24.740 --> 02:17:26.980 line:82%
it's my greatest strength.

1482
02:17:27.570 --> 02:17:29.940 line:82%
Love is my weakness...

1483
02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:32.730 line:82%
Why don't you understand that?

1484
02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:37.690 line:82%
Because a man and a woman
cannot be just friends!

1485
02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.030 line:82%
Go.

1486
02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:52.820 line:82%
Get out of here.

1487
02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:54.780 line:82%
Go.

1488
02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:58.150 line:82%
I can't explain this to you anymore.

1489
02:17:58.230 --> 02:18:01.690 line:82%
If you can't understand, just leave.

1490
02:18:01.890 --> 02:18:05.150 line:82%
Take your stuff and get out!

1491
02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:07.900 line:82%
Get out!

1492
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:09.690 line:82%
Get out, Ayan!

1493
02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:17.940 line:82%
Alizeh...

1494
02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:21.360 line:82%
Alizeh, I'm sorry...

1495
02:18:32.610 --> 02:18:35.480 line:82%
It's a strange story
of love and friendship.

1496
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:38.690 line:82%
Love, the hero...
and Friendship, the heroine.

1497
02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:42.230 line:82%
The awful thing is that
Love never understood Friendship.

1498
02:18:42.450 --> 02:18:46.780 line:82%
I do love you, Ayan...
Just not the way you want me to.

1499
02:18:47.070 --> 02:18:48.900 line:82%
Love is passion...

1500
02:18:49.810 --> 02:18:52.820 line:82%
but friendship is peace.

1501
02:18:55.780 --> 02:19:00.370 line:82%
One night, tired and weary,
Love threw a tantrum...

1502
02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:02.730 line:82%
Like a spoilt child... Stupid!

1503
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:04.940 line:82%
And what did Friendship do?

1504
02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:07.959 line:82%
Alizeh...

1505
02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:11.360 line:82%
Friendship threw a tantrum, too,
and left in a huff.

1506
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:17.110 line:82%
And where else do heroines go?

1507
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:18.920 line:82%
The airport.

1508
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:22.150 line:82%
"Ayan, I'm going back home."

1509
02:19:22.450 --> 02:19:24.530 line:82%
And Love freaked out...

1510
02:19:24.690 --> 02:19:28.320 line:82%
"I hope one day you'll
understand my love."

1511
02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:32.320 line:82%
When Love realised that Friendship
is leaving him forever... He ran.

1512
02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:35.480 line:82%
And how he ran!

1513
02:19:40.530 --> 02:19:41.549 line:82%
In taxis...

1514
02:19:41.610 --> 02:19:42.670 line:82%
Heathrow Airport!

1515
02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:46.780 line:82%
...in trains...

1516
02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:52.440 line:82%
He ran!

1517
02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:57.070 line:82%
He didn't stop to breathe...

1518
02:19:58.370 --> 02:20:02.070 line:82%
Because Love knew... Friendship
was about to breathe her last...

1519
02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:06.360 line:82%
And he wanted to be with
her 'til her last moments.

1520
02:20:07.290 --> 02:20:08.480 line:82%
That was Love's right.

1521
02:20:19.650 --> 02:20:21.980 line:82%
I need to get to BA 109!

1522
02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:25.980 line:82%
I'm sorry, the gate closed
20 minutes ago!

1523
02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:27.570 line:82%
Has the flight taken off?

1524
02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:29.070 line:82%
It's about to go!

1525
02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:37.440 line:82%
-Hello?
-Alizeh!

1526
02:20:37.650 --> 02:20:39.650 line:82%
I'm at the airport!
I'm here!

1527
02:20:39.970 --> 02:20:41.780 line:82%
Please don't go, Alizeh, please stay!

1528
02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:46.360 line:82%
Ayan, I'm taking off.

1529
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:28.320 line:82%
Hello?

1530
02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:04.320 line:82%
Alizeh...

1531
02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:07.530 line:82%
You can't die.

1532
02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:14.560 line:82%
Ma'am, keep that oxygen mask on.

1533
02:22:14.650 --> 02:22:17.780 line:82%
Alizeh, listen to him...
Put it back.

1534
02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:22.190 line:82%
Ayan...

1535
02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:26.360 line:82%
I'm acting, I'm not really dying.

1536
02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:29.370 line:82%
Don't react, we'll get caught.

1537
02:22:36.530 --> 02:22:39.400 line:82%
How else do you runaway
from a runway?

1538
02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:43.070 line:82%
Cancer's got to have some perks...

1539
02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:51.360 line:82%
You came to the airport, Ayan.

1540
02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:55.440 line:82%
You fulfilled my dream!

1541
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:59.900 line:82%
Alizeh, I'm sorry for last night.

1542
02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:06.320 line:82%
Friendship doesn't know
sorry's and thank you's.

1543
02:23:10.610 --> 02:23:14.690 line:82%
I swear I'll never trouble
you about this again.

1544
02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:17.570 line:82%
Because, Ayan,

1545
02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:22.190 line:82%
it's a lot like love!

1546
02:23:25.050 --> 02:23:26.900 line:82%
I friend you.

1547
02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:29.790 line:82%
I friend you, too.

1548
02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:32.230 line:82%
I friend you for life.

1549
02:23:33.310 --> 02:23:36.170 line:82%
I friend you, too,
for whatever life is left.

1550
02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:48.730 line:82%
Come, now, sing something...

1551
02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:51.940 line:82%
Anything you like... I'm sick!

1552
02:24:09.010 --> 02:24:10.150 line:82%
Interview done?

1553
02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:12.280 line:82%
Okay...

1554
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:15.190 line:82%
Hey... can I sing something?

1555
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:45.010 line:82%
Done.
