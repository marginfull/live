00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.933 line:82%
What about me, my lovely wife?

2
00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:05.853 line:82%
-Stop it. Think about your health.
-Yes, my friend.

3
00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:08.606 line:82%
I still don't understand
why you're going to London.

4
00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.735 line:82%
You're the scion of one
of the richest families of Shimla.

5
00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:15.654 line:82%
-He's not going for the money.
-What then?

6
00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:19.783 line:82%
Have you seen the babes in England?

7
00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.994 line:82%
Forget the babes.

8
00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:25.456 line:82%
It's not about money.
This is about the dot-com revolution.

9
00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:30.461 line:82%
Someday, computer technology
will be a huge industry.

10
00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.672 line:82%
That's where my ideas can
best be put to use.

11
00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:35.591 line:82%
Why else would I leave home?

12
00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:40.054 line:82%
-Will you forget us once you're there?
-How can you say that, Mr. Khanna?

13
00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:42.014 line:82%
We could never forget this friendship.

14
00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.237 line:82%
Tina, come, come.

15
00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:50.011 line:82%
If our parents' friendship isn't going to
end, why would our friendship end?

16
00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.512 line:82%
Our friendship will never end, Raj.

17
00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:56.320 line:82%
-Tina, you will write to me, won't you?
-Yeah, I'll write.

18
00:03:56.403 --> 00:04:01.241 line:82%
-I'll email you regularly.
-But I don't have a computer.

19
00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:03.953 line:82%
That's right, you don't own a computer.

20
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:05.746 line:82%
But I do.

21
00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:09.291 line:82%
Excellent, I'll email you
through Pooja's computer.

22
00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:12.461 line:82%
Pooja, you always help me out.
You're such a good friend.

23
00:04:12.545 --> 00:04:14.838 line:82%
Raj, the train's leaving.

24
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.939 line:82%
Bye, Pooja. Bye, Tina.

25
00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:19.635 line:82%
Bye.

26
00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:24.640 line:82%
Bye. I'll miss you, Raj.

27
00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.104 line:82%
Take care of yourself. Okay.

28
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.466 line:82%
-Call us, please.
-Bye.

29
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:02.678 line:82%
Dear Tina, London is such a big city.

30
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.911 line:82%
Such tall buildings and Big Ben is so
much bigger than the Shimla clock tower.

31
00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:11.687 line:82%
We live in Hampstead.
We're the only Indian family here.

32
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.689 line:82%
Everyone else is British.

33
00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:18.235 line:82%
"The best part about school here is,
you don't have to wear uniforms,

34
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:23.699 line:82%
everything's straight out
of an Archie comic. London is..."

35
00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:27.786 line:82%
-I'm bored.
-"...such a big and beautiful city.

36
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:31.040 line:82%
But I miss home, India, and you.

37
00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:38.024 line:82%
I'm waiting to hear from you.
Do write. Love, Raj."

38
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.174 line:82%
Raj has turned into a big bore.

39
00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:45.637 line:82%
Oh, god. Do I have to email him
back now? No way.

40
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:49.743 line:82%
-Tina, you promised him you'd write.
-Sure, right.

41
00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.319 line:82%
-Tina.
-Pooja.

42
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.000 line:82%
You're so mean. Raj is so sweet.

43
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.023 line:82%
You're always making Raj miserable.

44
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.151 line:82%
So now I have to email him?

45
00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.487 line:82%
If you're so keen,
why don't you write him?

46
00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:03.363 line:82%
-Bye.
-Bye.

47
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:13.377 line:82%
Dear Raj, London sounds so exciting.

48
00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:15.375 line:82%
Shimla is the same.

49
00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:19.074 line:82%
I thought about you at lunch today.
I ate your favorite gobi parathas.

50
00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:25.636 line:82%
Do you have gobi parathas in London?
Bye for now. I have to do my homework.

51
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:30.474 line:82%
Lots of love, Pooja.

52
00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:35.854 line:82%
Tina.

53
00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:47.032 line:82%
Dear Tina, I'm so happy you replied.
Now we'll always be friends.

54
00:06:47.366 --> 00:06:49.576 line:82%
Yes, I do have gobi parathas here.

55
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.539 line:82%
Our Italian chef makes them
under Mommy's supervision.

56
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:55.519 line:82%
But they don't taste the same.

57
00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:58.022 line:82%
Guess what, I came first in my class.

58
00:06:58.127 --> 00:07:02.840 line:82%
Wow, I didn't know you were as sharp
as Pooja in school.

59
00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:06.343 line:82%
Guess what,
I made the school's cricket team.

60
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.971 line:82%
Someday even I might become
a famous cricketer.

61
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.974 line:82%
I've made a new friend, Ronnie Mendonca.

62
00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:15.102 line:82%
l go to church every Sunday with Ronnie.

63
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:18.647 line:82%
Something strange happened
when I went to church today.

64
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.610 line:82%
l started humming a tune.
Now, I'm emailing you the tune.

65
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.523 line:82%
Your tune is as much of a habit with me
as you are.

66
00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.740 line:82%
Whenever I'm in church, I hum your tune.

67
00:07:45.424 --> 00:07:47.634 line:82%
For me, you're like a habit.

68
00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:53.015 line:82%
Unless I've written to you
about everything, I can't sleep.

69
00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.893 line:82%
You should take up reading.

70
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.853 line:82%
Try Love Story. It's such a nice story.

71
00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:02.149 line:82%
You know something, I only have
a 15 year old photo of you and Pooja.

72
00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:05.402 line:82%
I've asked you so many times,
please send me a photo.

73
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.447 line:82%
Considering that you say
you know me so well,

74
00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:12.910 line:82%
l want to see if you recognize me
when we're face to face.

75
00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:18.165 line:82%
Come on, I don't need a picture.
I'll recognize you the instant I see you.

76
00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.336 line:82%
Your image is in my heart.

77
00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:21.425 line:82%
Liar.

78
00:08:21.488 --> 00:08:26.048 line:82%
We'll know who the liar is soon.
l have some good news. I'm coming home.

79
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:30.252 line:82%
I'm coming back to India.
I'm going to see you again.

80
00:08:30.336 --> 00:08:33.116 line:82%
After so long, it'll be like seeing you
for the first time.

81
00:08:33.222 --> 00:08:34.973 line:82%
Gosh, I can't wait to see you, Tina.

82
00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:38.227 line:82%
You must be so beautiful, I'm sure.

83
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:44.233 line:82%
Still the prettiest,
still the most beautiful.

84
00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:50.656 line:82%
That's not me, Raj.
That's someone else, someone else.

85
00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:56.345 line:82%
-He's coming back.
-Who?

86
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.265 line:82%
-Raj.
-Who's Raj?

87
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.267 line:82%
-Pooja!
-Tina!

88
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.229 line:82%
What have you done, Pooja?
Why did you write letters in my name?

89
00:10:04.313 --> 00:10:06.690 line:82%
Okay, it was stupid.

90
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:10.527 line:82%
But you have to help me.
He'll only be here for two weeks.

91
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.364 line:82%
Just pretend for two weeks that
you wrote those letters, that's all.

92
00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:18.076 line:82%
-It's as simple as that.
-It's so stupid.

93
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.454 line:82%
Tina, after all I've done for you?

94
00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:25.625 line:82%
The only reason you've passed every year
is because I did your homework.

95
00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:28.295 line:82%
And you can't even do
this much for me?

96
00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:31.923 line:82%
Okay, stop trying to get my sympathy.

97
00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.967 line:82%
Just leave it to Tina.

98
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:36.762 line:82%
So, tell me, what does Raj look like?

99
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:40.932 line:82%
He's very handsome.
Six feet tall, blue eyes and--

100
00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.810 line:82%
Enough, let him come.

101
00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.647 line:82%
Let's see what this Raj is all about.

102
00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:38.990 line:82%
The one from my dreams

103
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:43.745 line:82%
l wonder what she'll be like

104
00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:49.167 line:82%

105
00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:52.629 line:82%
l wonder what she'll be like

106
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:58.677 line:82%
She's hiding in my heart for so long

107
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.597 line:82%
l wonder what she'll be like

108
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.061 line:82%

114
00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:37.257 line:82%

I've seen him in many different ways

117
00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:34.022 line:82%
It seems like I've seen him
all these days

118
00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:39.569 line:82%
The heavens are deciding

119
00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:43.490 line:82%
The fate of two hearts

120
00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:49.287 line:82%
Even without seeing him
I'm so restless

121
00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:53.667 line:82%
Oh, my God, what will happen to you
When you meet him?

122
00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:59.172 line:82%
Taking my dreams away

123
00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:02.926 line:82%
They're in my way
What will she be like?

124
00:14:03.552 --> 00:14:06.304 line:82%
In my eyes he has a place

125
00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.848 line:82%
In my heart since forever

126
00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:12.686 line:82%

It's the first time I'll meet the one

130
00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.367 line:82%
The only one of my dreams

131
00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:15.624 line:82%
I am so nervous
l don't know why

132
00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:19.628 line:82%
It's like hiding the moon in the sky

133
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.466 line:82%
l won't say a word to her

134
00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:29.512 line:82%
I'll just stare into her eyes

135
00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:35.185 line:82%
Oh, this restlessness
This eagerness

Wow. That's Raj? Not bad.
So how long does the act last?

150
00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:13.950 line:82%
Two weeks? Leave it to Tina.
What are friends for?

151
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.120 line:82%
Hey, Uncle Arjun, how are you?

152
00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.830 line:82%
-How are you, young man?
-Good.

153
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.541 line:82%
Raj has become so handsome.

154
00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:30.716 line:82%
Here comes my friend from London.
Play it up for my friend.

155
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.262 line:82%
Eat, drink, and be merry.

156
00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:36.514 line:82%
Hey, quit playing.

157
00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:40.351 line:82%
Come on. Give me a hug.

158
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.482 line:82%
-My dearest friend.
-What are you doing?

159
00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.234 line:82%
Taking a chance.

160
00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.384 line:82%
You must be Tina, right?

161
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.054 line:82%
"I'll recognize you the instant
I see you."

162
00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.723 line:82%
"Your image is in my heart."

163
00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:27.565 line:82%
You're even more beautiful
than I'd imagined.

164
00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:33.571 line:82%
l am, but you're not
so bad yourself, Mr. America.

165
00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:37.158 line:82%
America? But I'm from London.

166
00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:40.765 line:82%
London, America, who cares?
Anyway, once I've said it, I've said it.

167
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.413 line:82%
Understand, Mr. America?

168
00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.041 line:82%
God, you're too much.

169
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.544 line:82%
-Hey, Pooja!
-Yeah.

170
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.588 line:82%
Wow, you're all grown up too.

171
00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:53.675 line:82%
But I never thought Tina would grow up
to look like this.

172
00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:56.427 line:82%
So, what did you think?

173
00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.265 line:82%
How do I tell you
what I've thought about you?

174
00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:05.603 line:82%
Those who think, don't do,
and those who do, don't think.

175
00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.480 line:82%
Uncle!

176
00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:12.119 line:82%
Kids, what are you doing here?
Come on, let's get home.

177
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:15.154 line:82%
I'm celebrating your return
with a "kirtan" at home.

178
00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:17.824 line:82%
Oh, no, Uncle. Another prayer session?

179
00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:21.953 line:82%
Yes, one more.
Hail to the Mother Goddess!

180
00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:18.426 line:82%
I've heard that people sometimes forget
their culture when they go abroad.

181
00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:22.847 line:82%
l may have gone abroad,
but my heart was always here.

182
00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:30.146 line:82%
Now there's culture for you.
Mr. America's actually winking.

183
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:31.898 line:82%
-Tina!
-Pooja!

184
00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:46.704 line:82%
Amazing, you even look beautiful
in a "churidar."

185
00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:50.875 line:82%
l wish I could say the same for you.

186
00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:56.798 line:82%
Son, won't you join in the prayer?

187
00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:07.433 line:82%
l wonder what he'll be like

188
00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:12.605 line:82%
It's not that I don't like him.
He's good looking,

189
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:16.693 line:82%
but good looking guys tend to
have their noses up in the air.

190
00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.988 line:82%
-They need to be brought down to earth.
-No, Tina, Raj isn't like that.

191
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:23.074 line:82%
Really? You seem to be into Raj.

192
00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:28.329 line:82%
While writing all those letters,
l hope you didn't fall in love with him.

193
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:33.209 line:82%
I'm so stupid.
You're not going to fall in love.

194
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:39.257 line:82%
You only have time for your books
and computer. And you're a good daughter.

195
00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:43.219 line:82%
You're gonna marry the person
your parents choose for you.

196
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.429 line:82%
Tina!

197
00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.514 line:82%
And what kind of a marriage
are you going to have?

198
00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:49.308 line:82%
Me? I'm definitely going to marry
for love.

199
00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.686 line:82%
Are you in love with Raj?

200
00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:55.480 line:82%
Tina doesn't fall in love with boys.
Boys fall in love with Tina.

201
00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:58.235 line:82%
If you're talking about love,
then you must be talking about me.

202
00:21:58.309 --> 00:21:59.444 line:82%
You wish.

203
00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:00.528 line:82%
-Hi, Raj.
-Hi.

204
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:04.866 line:82%
Tina, remember when we were kids?
We'd skip school and come skiing here?

205
00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:08.661 line:82%
And Pooja used to bring our homework.
Pooja, what did you bring today?

206
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:10.204 line:82%
-Raj.
-Me? How's that?

207
00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:15.418 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America, bet? I'll win today
just like I used to when we were kids.

208
00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:20.798 line:82%
God, she's crazy. And I'm crazy about her.

209
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:23.718 line:82%
Hey, Tina, here I come.

210
00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:28.389 line:82%
Let's see who wins.

211
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.809 line:82%
l never accept defeat, Raj.

212
00:22:31.893 --> 00:22:34.103 line:82%
l really enjoy losing.

213
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.689 line:82%
You enjoy losing a race?

214
00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:38.399 line:82%
Who's talking about the race?

215
00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:42.070 line:82%
-What then?
-I'm talking about losing my heart.

216
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:46.949 line:82%
-Why are you in such a rush to lose?
-I'm not in a rush. I've already lost.

217
00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:51.162 line:82%
l don't shake hands with losers.

218
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:26.572 line:82%
Let me congratulate the winner.

219
00:23:31.035 --> 00:23:33.204 line:82%
That's how you turn defeat
into victory.

220
00:23:33.287 --> 00:23:34.497 line:82%
Very clever.

221
00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:38.584 line:82%
-Hey, Tina!
-Bye, Raj.

222
00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:42.797 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hey.

223
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:47.385 line:82%
-Who won?
-l lost a long time ago.

224
00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:48.511 line:82%
And now?

225
00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:50.513 line:82%
Now, it's in His hands.

226
00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:01.858 line:82%
For the first time, I've looked
at a guy and felt something.

227
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:05.486 line:82%
But this can't be love.

228
00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.573 line:82%
Love can't happen like this.

229
00:24:10.366 --> 00:24:13.244 line:82%
l thought when I fell in love,

230
00:24:13.661 --> 00:24:17.748 line:82%
I'd be on cloud nine.

231
00:24:17.832 --> 00:24:21.752 line:82%
l thought I'd feel shy around him,
but this is nothing like that.

232
00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:25.590 line:82%
Still, I like him.

233
00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:28.217 line:82%
It's easy to be friendly with people,

234
00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:33.598 line:82%
but love is something
l know nothing about.

235
00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:36.642 line:82%
This is where you come in.

236
00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:40.188 line:82%
Come on, you have to help me out
with this love thing, okay?

237
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:44.233 line:82%
Okay, good night.

238
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.985 line:82%
I'm sleepy.

239
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.747 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

240
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.875 line:82%
-I'm sorry, am I disturbing you?
-Not at all. Come in.

241
00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:04.086 line:82%
This is the same room, isn't it?

242
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.173 line:82%
This is the room that
Tina used to write to me from?

243
00:25:07.256 --> 00:25:10.968 line:82%
Same room, same computer and same me.

244
00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:14.138 line:82%
Wow, 15 years.

245
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:17.808 line:82%
It's exactly how I imagined it.

246
00:25:21.312 --> 00:25:23.397 line:82%
You're still working?

247
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:25.566 line:82%
I'm applying to some London universities.

248
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.986 line:82%
London? You're coming to London
and I didn't know?

249
00:25:29.487 --> 00:25:32.657 line:82%
-l wanted to surprise you.
-What will you be studying?

250
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.283 line:82%
-Art.
-Art?

251
00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:37.036 line:82%
Tina likes art too.
Which university are you applying to?

252
00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:38.454 line:82%
London University.

253
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.790 line:82%
-That's my university.
-l know.

254
00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:43.751 line:82%
Pooja, why didn't you ever email me?

255
00:25:44.752 --> 00:25:48.506 line:82%
If I had, would you have replied to me
like you replied to Tina?

256
00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:53.094 line:82%
-What's that supposed to mean?
-That's the point. Anyway, forget it.

257
00:25:53.178 --> 00:25:55.179 line:82%
You really like Tina, don't you?

258
00:25:56.681 --> 00:26:01.102 line:82%
You're her friend. I can tell you.

259
00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:05.189 line:82%
You know, Pooja,
without meeting each other,

260
00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:08.442 line:82%
without having seen each other, we...

261
00:26:08.526 --> 00:26:10.820 line:82%
We know everything about each other.

262
00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:12.238 line:82%
Not just that.

263
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.284 line:82%
-Perhaps we started falling in love.
-Without meeting.

264
00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:19.954 line:82%
-Without having seen each other.
-It's such a beautiful bond.

265
00:26:20.037 --> 00:26:23.249 line:82%
And what makes it so perfect
is that Tina is so beautiful.

266
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:25.126 line:82%
Yes, she is.

267
00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:27.920 line:82%
Pooja, we're going to be good friends.

268
00:26:28.004 --> 00:26:30.798 line:82%
You know, I've never had a friend
who's been a girl.

269
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:34.385 line:82%
You'll be my first girl friend.
Will you be my friend?

270
00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:06.334 line:82%
Would you be that special friend?

271
00:27:06.417 --> 00:27:10.755 line:82%
That special friend till the end

272
00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:15.134 line:82%
Would you be that special friend?

273
00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:19.115 line:82%
That special friend till the end

274
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:24.143 line:82%
If it's worth being friends with you

275
00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:28.064 line:82%
Let me tell you in a day or two

276
00:27:29.273 --> 00:27:33.057 line:82%
Would you be that special friend?

277
00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:37.114 line:82%
That special friend till the end

278
00:27:37.198 --> 00:27:42.119 line:82%
If it's worth being friends with you

279
00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:46.707 line:82%
Let me tell you in a day or two

280
00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:18.155 line:82%
If we've been friends for a long time

281
00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:23.328 line:82%
Then why behave in such different ways

282
00:28:23.411 --> 00:28:27.852 line:82%
Who knows what color this will bring

283
00:28:27.957 --> 00:28:32.336 line:82%
This childhood friendship

284
00:28:32.545 --> 00:28:36.465 line:82%
You never know when you'll fall in love

285
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.843 line:82%
That's so true
There is no clue

286
00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:41.137 line:82%
Who'll take your heart
And just go through

287
00:28:41.429 --> 00:28:46.058 line:82%
So, would you be that special friend?

288
00:28:46.142 --> 00:28:49.562 line:82%
If it's worth being friends with you

289
00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:54.483 line:82%
That special friend till the end

290
00:28:55.025 --> 00:28:58.737 line:82%
Let me tell you in a day or two

291
00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:04.034 line:82%
Would you be that special friend?

292
00:29:04.118 --> 00:29:08.164 line:82%
That special friend till the end

293
00:29:45.034 --> 00:29:48.662 line:82%
You are a friend of mine too

294
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:53.959 line:82%
So help me through your sunny ways

295
00:29:54.043 --> 00:29:57.755 line:82%
Go ask your friend the reason why

296
00:29:58.589 --> 00:30:02.593 line:82%
She is so clueless, she is so shy

297
00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:07.181 line:82%
There is no reason why
She is so clueless and so shy

298
00:30:07.598 --> 00:30:11.727 line:82%
I want to know if she wants to be
A friend, a friend for eternity?

299
00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:16.607 line:82%
So, would you be that special friend?

300
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.736 line:82%
That special friend till the end

301
00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:25.699 line:82%
If it's worth being friends with you

302
00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:29.370 line:82%
Let me tell you in a day or two

303
00:30:30.287 --> 00:30:34.917 line:82%
I said I'd be that special friend

304
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.712 line:82%
You say you'll be friends with me too

305
00:30:38.796 --> 00:30:43.717 line:82%
We'll see
I'll think about it

306
00:30:43.801 --> 00:30:48.222 line:82%
I'll tell you in a day or two

307
00:31:14.498 --> 00:31:16.166 line:82%
-Good morning, Pooja.
-Raj!

308
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:20.463 line:82%
What?

309
00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:25.551 line:82%
Aren't you ashamed,
walking into a girl's bedroom uninvited?

310
00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:29.471 line:82%
Aren't you, sleeping with your door
open with a young man in the house?

311
00:31:29.555 --> 00:31:31.599 line:82%
Never expected a shameless young man.

312
00:31:31.682 --> 00:31:34.476 line:82%
That's me.
Anyway, what are you doing today?

313
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.621 line:82%
Why?

314
00:31:35.699 --> 00:31:37.976 line:82%
Have lunch with Tina and me today.

315
00:31:38.022 --> 00:31:42.318 line:82%
-No, Raj, not today. I have to go...
-I'm not listening then. Too bad. Bye.

316
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.613 line:82%
Bye, Raj.

317
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.450 line:82%
This is such a romantic place.

318
00:31:50.492 --> 00:31:54.038 line:82%
There must a special reason
to bring me to such a romantic place.

319
00:31:54.622 --> 00:31:56.582 line:82%
-Yes, there is.
-What?

320
00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:57.791 line:82%
I'm hungry.

321
00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:06.175 line:82%
Tina, look.

322
00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:12.139 line:82%
Raj, why are you looking at a boy?

323
00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:14.308 line:82%
Don't you see what he's reading?

324
00:32:14.892 --> 00:32:16.185 line:82%
Love Story. So?

325
00:32:16.268 --> 00:32:18.228 line:82%
Tina, Love Story.

326
00:32:18.312 --> 00:32:20.939 line:82%
Love stories are so boring.

327
00:32:21.023 --> 00:32:22.232 line:82%
You don't remember?

328
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:27.946 line:82%
If you hang on to old memories,
how will you create new ones, Raj?

329
00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:30.532 line:82%
Okay.

330
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.586 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America.

331
00:32:43.921 --> 00:32:45.255 line:82%
What will you have?

332
00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:48.967 line:82%
You know what I like.

333
00:32:49.051 --> 00:32:50.760 line:82%
Gobi parathas.

334
00:32:50.844 --> 00:32:52.680 line:82%
-Hi, Pooja.
-Hi.

335
00:32:52.764 --> 00:32:54.014 line:82%
-Hello.
-You're late.

336
00:32:54.098 --> 00:32:55.182 line:82%
I completely forgot.

337
00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:57.017 line:82%
Coming. I'm coming.
Raj, I have to go.

338
00:32:57.101 --> 00:33:01.438 line:82%
The youth festival is coming up. As usual,
my dance performance will be the best.

339
00:33:01.522 --> 00:33:05.359 line:82%
Watch me, okay? Gotta go.
Everyone's waiting for me.

340
00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:08.654 line:82%
Bye. Thanks, you saved us today.

341
00:33:11.573 --> 00:33:14.159 line:82%
Youth festival? Every year?

342
00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:18.288 line:82%
Strange. She never wrote about that.

343
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:22.710 line:82%
You know, Pooja,

344
00:33:23.377 --> 00:33:28.799 line:82%
l can't figure out why Tina seems
so different in person.

345
00:33:29.925 --> 00:33:33.104 line:82%
Look, Raj, you guys just met
for the first time.

346
00:33:33.637 --> 00:33:35.347 line:82%
Give her some time.

347
00:33:35.431 --> 00:33:38.350 line:82%
You know, Tina's a bit forgetful.

348
00:33:39.143 --> 00:33:42.896 line:82%
Anyway, writing to someone
and meeting face to face is so different.

349
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.414 line:82%
You know, I'd just die to be with her.

350
00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:52.114 line:82%
When I'm not with her, I imagine
what it will be like when we're together,

351
00:33:53.282 --> 00:33:58.954 line:82%
but when we're together,
it's so different.

352
00:33:59.872 --> 00:34:02.708 line:82%
Have you heard that song?
You're in that state of mind.

353
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:04.251 line:82%
Which song?

354
00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:07.463 line:82%
If I don't see you, I worry

355
00:34:07.555 --> 00:34:09.548 line:82%
But when I see you, I feel shy

356
00:34:09.631 --> 00:34:14.981 line:82%
What's wrong with you?

357
00:34:15.095 --> 00:34:19.578 line:82%
What's wrong with me?

358
00:34:19.683 --> 00:34:21.977 line:82%
Hey, parathas! Who ordered them?

359
00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:24.897 line:82%
Raj, you're such a little kid.

360
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:30.903 line:82%
It's still hot.

361
00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:36.116 line:82%
-Dip hot parathas into cool yogurt...
-And then straight into your mouth.

362
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:42.270 line:82%
It's more fun when someone feeds you.

363
00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:52.883 line:82%
-When will Tina's rehearsal be over?
-This evening.

364
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:55.451 line:82%
Did you go to a rehearsal
or to a wholesale market?

365
00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:58.556 line:82%
l have to have the perfect look.

366
00:34:58.889 --> 00:35:00.649 line:82%
All this shopping is just for that?

367
00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:02.761 line:82%
l couldn't make up my mind.

368
00:35:02.935 --> 00:35:04.561 line:82%
So you bought out the store.

369
00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:07.147 line:82%
-Pooja.
-Tina.

370
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.859 line:82%
Pooja, Tina, we're home.

371
00:35:13.529 --> 00:35:18.492 line:82%
Tina, don't you have something
to say to me?

372
00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:23.080 line:82%
-What?
-Do I have to tell you?

373
00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:29.086 line:82%
-Not so fast.
-Fifteen years is a long time.

374
00:35:29.419 --> 00:35:31.129 line:82%
What do you think, Pooja? Pooja?

375
00:35:31.547 --> 00:35:35.342 line:82%
Hey, Pooja, don't you think
15 years is a long time?

376
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.595 line:82%
Fifteen years wasn't long enough.

377
00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:43.846 line:82%
Why can't girls ever give a simple answer
to a simple question?

378
00:35:44.059 --> 00:35:45.853 line:82%
-What?
-Bye.

379
00:35:45.936 --> 00:35:46.979 line:82%
Good night, Raj.

380
00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:50.774 line:82%
That's not how we say good night
in London.

381
00:35:52.526 --> 00:35:57.281 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America, tell me, how
do you say good night in London?

382
00:35:58.031 --> 00:35:59.658 line:82%
You need to be a little closer.

383
00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:05.414 line:82%
Your eyes need to be closed.

384
00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:18.385 line:82%
Good night.

385
00:36:19.553 --> 00:36:20.554 line:82%
Good night.

386
00:36:28.698 --> 00:36:32.232 line:82%

-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.615 line:82%
Hand me the cereal.

391
00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:44.119 line:82%
Cereal-eater, what about the parathas?

392
00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.996 line:82%
Those parathas are adding
to your paunch.

393
00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:49.140 line:82%
There's a cauliflower one, a potato one
and a radish one. It all shows.

394
00:36:49.244 --> 00:36:53.587 line:82%
-No. That's my wife's love.
-Here's some more. With love.

395
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.799 line:82%
-We've had a really good proposal.
-Are you crazy?

396
00:36:57.883 --> 00:37:00.010 line:82%
I can't get remarried
when you're still alive.

397
00:37:00.093 --> 00:37:02.012 line:82%
-Poor fool. Look at him.
-Keep quiet.

398
00:37:02.095 --> 00:37:04.097 line:82%
Do you always have to joke around?

399
00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:07.225 line:82%
It's not for you. It's for Pooja.

400
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:09.227 line:82%
-For Pooja?
-Yes.

401
00:37:09.478 --> 00:37:13.398 line:82%
Nice people, the Vermas from London.
They own three restaurants. Nice boy.

402
00:37:13.482 --> 00:37:14.691 line:82%
-What?
-Really.

403
00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:19.154 line:82%
Proposals for Pooja from London.
After all, whose daughter is she?

404
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.238 line:82%
Pooja, hold on.

405
00:37:20.322 --> 00:37:23.241 line:82%
What is it, Mama? I'm in a hurry.
I'm meeting Raj at 9:30.

Listen, there's been a proposal for you.

407
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.872 line:82%
I already told you,
I'm not ready to get married.

408
00:37:30.707 --> 00:37:34.128 line:82%
Hear me out. It's from London.

409
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:35.462 line:82%

411
00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:45.889 line:82%
Mama, I'm not interested.
Tell what's-his-name, Rohan Verma.

412
00:37:46.348 --> 00:37:49.184 line:82%
She turned it down
without even seeing the boy.

413
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.354 line:82%
-After all, whose daughter is it?
-Eat.

414
00:37:59.903 --> 00:38:01.697 line:82%
Raj, what's going on?

415
00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.579 line:82%
Raj...

416
00:38:11.081 --> 00:38:12.749 line:82%
How will this look on Tina?

417
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.712 line:82%
It would look beautiful on anyone.

418
00:38:17.713 --> 00:38:20.716 line:82%
This is no ordinary pendant. Look.

419
00:38:24.386 --> 00:38:26.388 line:82%
You really know how to break hearts.

420
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.598 line:82%
No, I'm reuniting hearts.

421

and the other with Tina.

422
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:36.815 line:82%
Isn't it amazing?

423
00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:39.526 line:82%

426
00:38:43.196 --> 00:38:45.907 line:82%
-I'll have one of these, please. Thanks.
-Yes, sir.

427
00:38:47.701 --> 00:38:49.870 line:82%
Actually, give me one more.

428
00:38:50.704 --> 00:38:53.165 line:82%
-One more?
-For you.

429
00:38:53.248 --> 00:38:54.499 line:82%
For me?

430
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:59.087 line:82%
When you find someone special,
you can give him half.

431
00:39:00.922 --> 00:39:03.133 line:82%
Finding someone special isn't so easy.

432
00:39:04.176 --> 00:39:05.761 line:82%
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

433
00:39:12.763 --> 00:39:15.062 line:82%
l thought you wanted to wait.

434
00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:19.775 line:82%
You? What are you doing here?
What if Daddy sees you?

435
00:39:19.827 --> 00:39:23.028 line:82%
What if Daddy doesn't see me?

436
00:39:24.154 --> 00:39:28.325 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America,
maybe you're not as smart as you look.

437
00:39:29.242 --> 00:39:34.081 line:82%
Hey, Miss Universe,
maybe you're not as beautiful as you look.

438
00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:39.002 line:82%
You're much more beautiful than that.

439
00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:47.135 line:82%
Look at this,
one half of this heart will be with me

440
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.265 line:82%
and the other half with you.

441
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:54.684 line:82%

of the night and declare their love.

443
00:40:03.193 --> 00:40:06.655 line:82%
I'll believe it when you say it
in front of everyone.

444
00:40:08.532 --> 00:40:11.535 line:82%
Then I will make you wear this pendant
in front of everyone.

445
00:40:14.121 --> 00:40:17.833 line:82%
Where do you think you're going?
What if Daddy sees you?

446
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.670 line:82%
Anyone can come in through the window.

447
00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:26.591 line:82%
Not bad.

448
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.636 line:82%

Right here, right now, all I'll say is

464
00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:50.383 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

465
00:41:51.301 --> 00:41:54.221 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

466
00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:58.172 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

467
00:41:58.266 --> 00:42:01.686 line:82%
Today's guys, I tell you

468
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.731 line:82%
Such morons, what to do?

469
00:42:40.058 --> 00:42:43.103 line:82%
They want to meet up
Hiding from everyone

470
00:42:43.186 --> 00:42:46.022 line:82%
They want to go out
Hiding from everyone

471
00:42:49.818 --> 00:42:53.238 line:82%
They want to meet up
Hiding from everyone

472
00:42:53.655 --> 00:42:56.491 line:82%
They want to go out
Hiding from everyone

473
00:42:56.783 --> 00:43:00.412 line:82%
I'm not scared of anyone

474
00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:03.832 line:82%
l just want you to be the only one

475
00:43:04.082 --> 00:43:07.460 line:82%
How am I supposed to know?

476
00:43:07.544 --> 00:43:10.338 line:82%
Hold my hand and prove it

477
00:43:10.422 --> 00:43:14.217 line:82%
Holding your hand
You know what I will do

478
00:43:14.426 --> 00:43:17.512 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

479
00:43:17.846 --> 00:43:20.765 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

480
00:43:21.016 --> 00:43:24.144 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

481
00:43:24.894 --> 00:43:27.939 line:82%
Today's guys, I tell you

482
00:43:28.023 --> 00:43:30.859 line:82%
Such morons, what to do?

483
00:44:12.734 --> 00:44:15.987 line:82%
Then let's cross the seven seas

484
00:44:16.071 --> 00:44:19.366 line:82%
Together we will always be

485
00:44:19.449 --> 00:44:21.910 line:82%
Where will you do such a thing?

486
00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:26.331 line:82%
Then let's cross the seven seas

487
00:44:26.414 --> 00:44:29.834 line:82%
Together we will always be

488
00:44:29.918 --> 00:44:33.129 line:82%
With you I would never go

489
00:44:33.213 --> 00:44:36.758 line:82%
Risking my life to do so

490
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:40.178 line:82%
Only if you drown in love

491
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:43.473 line:82%
Will you not fear God above?

492
00:44:43.556 --> 00:44:47.060 line:82%
If that's the case then I'll tell you

493
00:44:47.143 --> 00:44:50.522 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

494
00:44:50.594 --> 00:44:53.900 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

495
00:44:53.983 --> 00:44:56.861 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

496
00:44:56.945 --> 00:44:59.989 line:82%
Hey, modern girl, I tell you

497
00:45:00.782 --> 00:45:03.618 line:82%
Hey, modern boy, I tell you

498
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:07.288 line:82%
l won't say, how are you?

499
00:45:07.747 --> 00:45:10.750 line:82%
l won't say, how do you do?

500
00:45:11.167 --> 00:45:14.462 line:82%
Right here, right now
I'm going to say it

501
00:45:14.537 --> 00:45:17.715 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

502
00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:21.386 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

Come on, everybody, sing with me

505
00:45:33.356 --> 00:45:35.024 line:82%
I love you

506
00:45:36.651 --> 00:45:38.403 line:82%
I love you

507
00:45:38.486 --> 00:45:41.739 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

508
00:45:41.823 --> 00:45:45.118 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

509
00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:48.496 line:82%
Oh, my darling, I love you

510
00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:52.208 line:82%

I love you

514
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:11.102 line:82%
Oh, yeah?

515
00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:17.400 line:82%
This year, once again,
the winner is Tina Kapoor.

516
00:46:22.662 --> 00:46:23.781 line:82%
Ready?

517
00:46:23.865 --> 00:46:26.284 line:82%
Don't move. I'm coming in.

518
00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:31.122 line:82%
Look ahead. Smile.

519
00:46:34.334 --> 00:46:36.252 line:82%
Okay, now, only the winners.

520
00:46:36.336 --> 00:46:38.046 line:82%
Failures out, failures out.

521
00:46:38.838 --> 00:46:40.340 line:82%
Come, Pooja.

522
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.300 line:82%
Excellent. Hold that.

523
00:46:43.593 --> 00:46:47.472 line:82%
-Tell me again that you love me.
-Again?

524
00:46:48.348 --> 00:46:52.852 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America, that was just a song.
Did you really believe it?

525
00:46:52.936 --> 00:46:56.189 line:82%
Hey, Miss Universe, I was declaring
my love for you in the song.

526
00:46:57.023 --> 00:46:58.274 line:82%
Too bad for you.

527
00:46:59.776 --> 00:47:01.694 line:82%
Say that you love me.

528
00:47:08.284 --> 00:47:09.953 line:82%
Pooja, where are you? Come on.

529
00:47:10.203 --> 00:47:12.330 line:82%
Hey, come on, Pooja. Come on, come on.

530
00:47:13.623 --> 00:47:15.166 line:82%
Okay.

531
00:47:16.793 --> 00:47:17.877 line:82%
Say that you love me.

532
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.384 line:82%
It's late. Bye, good night.

533
00:47:24.717 --> 00:47:26.386 line:82%
Good night, everybody.

534
00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:53.788 line:82%
I'm going to change.

535
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:56.309 line:82%
-Hey, Kapoor.
-Yes.

536
00:47:56.374 --> 00:47:59.419 line:82%
My son seems to have won two trophies.

537
00:48:00.253 --> 00:48:01.504 line:82%
Really, and what's that?

538
00:48:02.088 --> 00:48:03.381 line:82%
Should I say it?

539
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:10.263 line:82%
-Here's my son's real victory.
-Really?

540
00:48:12.015 --> 00:48:13.016 line:82%
Yes.

541
00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:20.023 line:82%
My daughter is naive.

542
00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:22.442 line:82%
But we're sensible.

543
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:28.823 line:82%
l like Tina. What do you say?

544
00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:32.499 line:82%
I've been hoping for a daughter-in-law,
and Tina is like our own daughter.

545
00:48:32.584 --> 00:48:33.870 line:82%
Right.

546
00:48:34.871 --> 00:48:36.451 line:82%
l can't believe this.

547
00:48:37.165 --> 00:48:40.793 line:82%
You're such a successful man and
you want Tina for a daughter-in-law?

548
00:48:40.877 --> 00:48:43.713 line:82%
Hey, this isn't a movie.

549
00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:49.677 line:82%
Money doesn't make you successful.
Can we put a value on friendship?

550
00:48:51.346 --> 00:48:55.558 line:82%
This is my promise to you.
Tina will marry Raj.

551
00:48:55.642 --> 00:48:56.809 line:82%
Yes.

552
00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:01.856 line:82%
Wonderful. Wonderful.
We have to have a picture.

553
00:49:02.732 --> 00:49:03.983 line:82%
Action.

554
00:49:08.363 --> 00:49:12.992 line:82%
What's happening to me?
Nothing ever embarrassed me before.

555
00:49:13.618 --> 00:49:17.538 line:82%
I've never felt anything in my heart
for anyone before, but now,

556
00:49:18.206 --> 00:49:22.627 line:82%
whenever Raj...
You know what I'm trying to say.

557
00:49:22.835 --> 00:49:26.714 line:82%
But I don't know.
What are you trying to say?

558
00:49:28.174 --> 00:49:30.510 line:82%
-Raj.
-Hey.

559
00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:33.016 line:82%
l didn't know you prayed to Radha
and Krishna.

560
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:36.432 line:82%
l thought I knew everything about you.

561
00:49:37.433 --> 00:49:39.696 line:82%
You've hidden quite a lot from me.

562
00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:43.106 line:82%
Raj, you shouldn't eavesdrop.

563
00:49:43.815 --> 00:49:46.226 line:82%
But you were talking about me.

564
00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:49.654 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America, what do you think?

565
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:52.740 line:82%
l only think about you all the time?

566
00:49:53.282 --> 00:49:58.204 line:82%
Not all the time, maybe just all day,
when you're awake?

567
00:49:59.539 --> 00:50:03.042 line:82%
Well, I could be dreaming of you
when I'm asleep too.

568
00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:06.754 line:82%
-Looks like that's where we'll meet next.
-Why?

569
00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:10.550 line:82%
l have to go back, Tina. Tomorrow.

570
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.553 line:82%
Tomorrow? So soon?

571
00:50:15.555 --> 00:50:18.683 line:82%
l did write to you
that I was only coming for two weeks.

572
00:50:19.892 --> 00:50:23.312 line:82%
Wrote? Your emails.

573
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.024 line:82%
Raj, can't you stay for a few more days?

574
00:50:28.109 --> 00:50:29.694 line:82%
Nope, not possible.

575
00:50:29.777 --> 00:50:32.330 line:82%
We're launching a website
for a British company.

576
00:50:33.865 --> 00:50:35.331 line:82%
What's the matter?

577
00:50:35.575 --> 00:50:38.161 line:82%
You're the one who's leaving.

578
00:50:38.244 --> 00:50:44.125 line:82%
Come on. I'm going away, but I'll be back.

579
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:47.503 line:82%
I'll be back. Promise.

580
00:50:49.297 --> 00:50:53.342 line:82%
But I still haven't heard
what I've been waiting to hear.

581
00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:59.137 line:82%
Won't you say it once before I leave?

582
00:51:00.475 --> 00:51:04.812 line:82%
Go. I won't say it till you come back.

583
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.369 line:82%
Now I'll have to come back.

584
00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:16.908 line:82%
You have to bring him back. Fast.

585
00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:25.458 line:82%
-You're still awake?
-You too?

586
00:51:26.209 --> 00:51:30.254 line:82%
-l was saying bye to Tina.
-Bye? Oh, right.

587
00:51:30.922 --> 00:51:33.883 line:82%
It's been two weeks.
You have to launch that website.

588
00:51:34.509 --> 00:51:36.385 line:82%
You remember everything.

589
00:51:36.469 --> 00:51:38.638 line:82%
Tina didn't even remember I was leaving.

590
00:51:38.888 --> 00:51:40.810 line:82%
Maybe she didn't want to remember.

591
00:51:41.474 --> 00:51:44.602 line:82%
She still hasn't told me she loves me.

592
00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:46.234 line:82%
Have you told her?

593
00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:50.113 line:82%
Do I need to?
It should just be understood.

594
00:51:50.233 --> 00:51:52.893 line:82%
Then maybe you don't understand
matters of the heart.

595
00:51:56.614 --> 00:52:00.868 line:82%
How do you do it, Pooja?
How do you understand me so well?

596
00:52:00.952 --> 00:52:04.121 line:82%
If I take you for a friend,
l have to live up to that, right?

597
00:52:04.205 --> 00:52:05.403 line:82%
Right.

598
00:52:05.498 --> 00:52:07.250 line:82%
-Hey.
-What is it?

599
00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:10.503 line:82%
-That's a beautiful song.
-It's one of your favorites.

600
00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:13.464 line:82%
I love this song. Raj Kapoor is a genius.
Play it a little louder?

601
00:52:13.548 --> 00:52:14.674 line:82%
Okay.

602
00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:19.846 line:82%
That's the problem
with these old cassettes.

603
00:52:20.596 --> 00:52:24.642 line:82%
I've fallen in love

604
00:52:25.017 --> 00:52:28.855 line:82%
Then why is my heart so afraid of love?

605
00:52:30.106 --> 00:52:31.683 line:82%
Come on.

606
00:52:32.066 --> 00:52:35.746 line:82%
My heart says the road ahead is difficult

607
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.782 line:82%
And the destination is unknown

608
00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:43.786 line:82%
My heart says the road ahead is difficult

609
00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:47.665 line:82%
And the destination is unknown

610
00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:51.085 line:82%
I've fallen in love

611
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.675 line:82%
I'm in love, yet I am so afraid of love?

612
00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:01.743 line:82%
I'll miss you, buddy.

613
00:53:02.722 --> 00:53:04.015 line:82%
You know what?

614
00:53:04.807 --> 00:53:07.894 line:82%
You have to do your admissions interview
at some point.

615
00:53:07.977 --> 00:53:09.520 line:82%
Why don't you come with me?

616
00:53:10.897 --> 00:53:13.244 line:82%
How can I go until I hear from them?

617
00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:17.417 line:82%
It'd be nice if you're there.
l won't feel so far away from Tina.

618
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:20.967 line:82%
Oh, so that's why you want me there?

619
00:53:21.032 --> 00:53:23.409 line:82%
Come on, Pooja. I'm just joking.

620
00:53:24.452 --> 00:53:27.805 line:82%
You've become such a good friend
in these few days.

621
00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:30.535 line:82%
What if I need my friend?

622
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:34.378 line:82%
Close your eyes, think of me
and I'll be there.

623
00:53:34.462 --> 00:53:36.297 line:82%
-Promise?
-l swear.

624
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.758 line:82%
I'll take you up on that. Bye.

625
00:53:41.177 --> 00:53:42.595 line:82%
I'll miss you.

626
00:53:43.095 --> 00:53:44.388 line:82%
Bye, Raj.

627
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:47.850 line:82%
I'll miss you, Raj.

628
00:53:51.062 --> 00:53:53.522 line:82%
You're lucky that she turned out
the way she did.

629
00:53:53.606 --> 00:53:56.776 line:82%
If she'd been not so easy on the eye,
you'd be in trouble.

630
00:53:56.859 --> 00:53:59.028 line:82%
Ronnie, do you only go by
physical appearances?

631
00:53:59.111 --> 00:54:02.156 line:82%
Isn't that what you're doing?
You're not looking at the other one.

632
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:05.201 line:82%
-Who? Pooja?
-Pooja? Who's Pooja?

633
00:54:05.284 --> 00:54:07.536 line:82%
Pooja is our childhood friend.

634
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.081 line:82%
You had some childhood.

635
00:54:10.164 --> 00:54:12.375 line:82%
Tina on one side and Pooja on the other.

636
00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:13.537 line:82%
Ronnie.

637
00:54:15.836 --> 00:54:18.130 line:82%
So tell me how was she,
this childhood friend?

638
00:54:19.757 --> 00:54:24.178 line:82%
She knows me so well.
She knows what I like to eat.

639
00:54:24.887 --> 00:54:27.223 line:82%
She loves Hindi music like I do.

640
00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:29.266 line:82%
She's such a great girl, Pooja.

641
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:32.979 line:82%
Pooja? I thought
you were talking about Tina.

642
00:54:36.399 --> 00:54:38.442 line:82%
Hey, Raj, coming?

643
00:54:39.944 --> 00:54:41.112 line:82%
Coming.

644
00:54:41.821 --> 00:54:45.408 line:82%
Papa, even though I really want to,
l can't express what's in my heart.

645
00:54:45.992 --> 00:54:48.619 line:82%
Some things are better left unsaid.

646
00:54:49.328 --> 00:54:52.456 line:82%
And what if they're not heard
because they're left unsaid?

647
00:54:52.957 --> 00:54:56.752 line:82%
If you say them with a true heart,
they'll always be heard.

648
00:54:58.671 --> 00:55:02.508 line:82%
That's a big risk. What if Mr. America
turns out to be Mr. Stupid?

649
00:55:03.926 --> 00:55:05.928 line:82%
You're really opening up.

650
00:55:06.012 --> 00:55:08.389 line:82%
You were so shy in front of the others.

651
00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:13.144 line:82%
Watch me. Next time, I'll say it
in front of everyone that Raj and I...

652
00:55:39.129 --> 00:55:42.381 line:82%
Close your eyes, think of me
and I'll be there.

653
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.732 line:82%
Gobi parathas?

654
00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.580 line:82%
Ronnie, did you bring lunch from home?

655
00:56:14.663 --> 00:56:17.666 line:82%
No, Mom is away. I'm having a burger.

656
00:56:29.261 --> 00:56:32.056 line:82%
You? What are you doing here?

657
00:56:32.139 --> 00:56:33.265 line:82%
Gobi parathas.

658
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:36.644 line:82%
-l was just thinking about you.
-What did I tell you?

659
00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:40.439 line:82%
If you miss me, just close your eyes,
think of me and I'll be there. Here I am.

660
00:56:41.273 --> 00:56:44.026 line:82%
Gobi parathas, in London,
mind blowing.

661
00:56:45.653 --> 00:56:48.906 line:82%
What's with Mummy and Daddy?
They don't seem to want to return.

662
00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:51.408 line:82%
Are they planning to settle down
in Shimla again?

663
00:56:51.492 --> 00:56:54.411 line:82%
Your father keeps postponing
their tickets.

664
00:56:54.495 --> 00:56:57.164 line:82%
-And you? When's your interview?
-Tomorrow.

665
00:56:57.248 --> 00:57:00.084 line:82%
-And then?
-I'm thinking of staying a week.

666
00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:01.168 line:82%
I'll go shopping.

667
00:57:01.252 --> 00:57:05.714 line:82%
Go shopping another time. You're in
my town. I'm going to show you around.

668
00:57:05.798 --> 00:57:09.510 line:82%
No work for a week.
I'll show you London City.

669
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:42.645 line:82%
Raj? This is a lovely church.

670
00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:45.147 line:82%
Isn't it? I come here every Sunday.

671
00:58:45.231 --> 00:58:47.024 line:82%
Oh, this is the church.

672
00:59:11.423 --> 00:59:12.883 line:82%
-What will you be studying?
-Art.

673
00:59:12.967 --> 00:59:15.239 line:82%
Art? Tina likes art too.

674
00:59:15.344 --> 00:59:17.137 line:82%
Love stories are so boring.

675
00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:20.891 line:82%
Your letters?

676
00:59:20.943 --> 00:59:24.019 line:82%
Writing to someone and
meeting face to face is so different.

677
00:59:24.228 --> 00:59:27.731 line:82%
l thought I knew everything about you.
You've hidden quite a lot from me.

678
00:59:27.815 --> 00:59:29.566 line:82%
Finding someone special isn't so easy.

679
00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:31.068 line:82%
Pooja, what did you bring today?

680
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:32.236 line:82%
-Raj.
-Me?

681
00:59:32.695 --> 00:59:34.530 line:82%
But you never emailed me.

682
00:59:35.447 --> 00:59:37.616 line:82%
You don't understand matters of the heart.

683
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:41.662 line:82%
Maybe you don't understand
matters of the heart.

684
01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.319 line:82%
Tina doesn't even know this tune.

685
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.407 line:82%
The cricket posters in your room,

686
01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:22.911 line:82%
the crucifix on your wall.

687
01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.458 line:82%
Every Sunday, you go to church.

688
01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.962 line:82%
The copy of Love Story on your shelf.

689
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.216 line:82%
Gobi parathas.

690
01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:38.844 line:82%
Nothing.

691
01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:44.391 line:82%
Tina knows nothing about any of them.

692
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.272 line:82%
Tina isn't different from her letters.

693
01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:56.445 line:82%
Tina is different from your letters.

694
01:00:58.572 --> 01:00:59.823 line:82%
It was you.

695
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.328 line:82%
It was you?

696
01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:11.251 line:82%
Answer me, Pooja.

697
01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:16.590 line:82%
Why did you lie to me? Why the act?

698
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:22.471 line:82%
Why did you play this cruel joke on me?
Why did you play with my heart?

699
01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:27.684 line:82%
Why, Pooja? Why?

700
01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:34.608 line:82%
"I'll recognize you the instant I see you.
Your image is in my heart."

701
01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:38.112 line:82%
Isn't that what you wrote?

702
01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:41.824 line:82%
l was waiting for you, Raj.

703
01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:45.327 line:82%
But at the station
you didn't even look at me.

704
01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:48.580 line:82%
You just walked past me.

705
01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:56.338 line:82%
You never thought Tina could be Pooja
because Tina is so beautiful.

706
01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:04.179 line:82%
Didn't we decide, Raj, that we would
recognize each other's hearts?

707
01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:08.767 line:82%
But you fell for Tina's beauty.

708
01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:11.937 line:82%
You fell for her immediately.

709
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:20.279 line:82%
Raj, the truth is that we always want
the one we love to be most exotic.

710
01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:25.951 line:82%
But that's not me, Raj, that's not me.

711
01:02:27.828 --> 01:02:33.208 line:82%
Tina won't admit it,
but I know she's in love with you,

712
01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:36.879 line:82%
and you know it too.

713
01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:41.550 line:82%
It's not right.
This love wasn't Tina's to begin with.

714
01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.428 line:82%
Tina will have to understand

715
01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:49.308 line:82%
that I've always loved the person
who wrote me those letters,

716
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:55.981 line:82%
and it wasn't Tina.

717
01:02:58.233 --> 01:02:59.735 line:82%
She's completely different.

718
01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:07.743 line:82%
If we make this lie into the truth,
then we'll suffer for it, Pooja,

719
01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.206 line:82%
you, Tina and l.

720
01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:17.836 line:82%
There's only one truth in this lie, Pooja.

721
01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:20.672 line:82%
Only one truth.

722
01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:24.326 line:82%
The truth...

723
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.680 line:82%
is that I love...

724
01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:34.269 line:82%
I've always...

725
01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.731 line:82%
loved only you.

726
01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:41.276 line:82%
Only you.

727
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.479 line:82%
No, Raj.

728
01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:51.578 line:82%
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else, Pooja.

729
01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:56.124 line:82%
This was meant to be, Pooja.

730
01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.337 line:82%
Your coming for the interview,

731
01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.173 line:82%
humming that tune in this church,

732
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:10.806 line:82%
this all happened for a reason.

733
01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.645 line:82%
He decided we should be together, Pooja.

734
01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:18.981 line:82%
He brought us together.

735
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:24.152 line:82%
And He will make sure
we stay together forever.

736
01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:27.155 line:82%
Together forever.

737
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:38.709 line:82%
No, Raj, it's too late.

738
01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:40.460 line:82%
Pooja...

739
01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:46.800 line:82%
It's too late, Raj. Too late.

740
01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:03.775 line:82%
Only God knows how long
You've been in my heart

741
01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:09.865 line:82%
It seems you've always been with me

742
01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:14.953 line:82%
l promise...

743
01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:22.416 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

744
01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:27.507 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

745
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:04.127 line:82%
Only God knows how long
You've been in my heart

746
01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:08.548 line:82%
It seems you've always been with me

747
01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:11.927 line:82%
l promise...

748
01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:17.516 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

749
01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:22.479 line:82%
Only God knows how long
You've been in my heart

750
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:26.901 line:82%
It seems you've always been with me

751
01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:31.446 line:82%
l promise...

752
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.844 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

753
01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:40.664 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

754
01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:33.550 line:82%
Life is like a long path

755
01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:37.471 line:82%
Where people just keep walking by

756
01:07:38.305 --> 01:07:42.476 line:82%
Who are you waiting for then?

757
01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:47.022 line:82%
Walk along till the end

758
01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:51.193 line:82%
I've been waiting all this while

759
01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:56.031 line:82%
Since the day I met you

760
01:07:56.531 --> 01:08:00.869 line:82%
Only God knows how long
You've been in my heart

761
01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:05.040 line:82%
It seems you've always been with me

762
01:08:05.499 --> 01:08:09.127 line:82%
l promise...

763
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:14.007 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

764
01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:19.137 line:82%
There will never be another

765
01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:09.521 line:82%
Love is like a sacrifice

766
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:13.650 line:82%
Which people always have to bare

767
01:09:14.568 --> 01:09:18.697 line:82%
Let us take this sacrifice

768
01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:22.492 line:82%
To show that we really care

769
01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:28.122 line:82%
I'd do anything for you

770
01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:32.002 line:82%
To show that I love you too

771
01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:37.132 line:82%
Only God knows how long
You've been in my heart

772
01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:41.553 line:82%

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:08.955 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

779
01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:13.585 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

780
01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:36.900 line:82%
Come, let's go back to Shimla
and tell everyone the truth.

781
01:10:49.955 --> 01:10:53.083 line:82%
These bangles have been
in our family for years.

782
01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.460 line:82%
Every daughter-in-law wears them.

783
01:10:56.628 --> 01:11:00.507 line:82%
When Ma sees you wearing them,
she'll understand everything.

784
01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:05.470 line:82%
Now I've given you
all my gold and my diamonds.

785
01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:10.266 line:82%
-And now, one time?
-Not now. After the wedding.

786
01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:14.145 line:82%
That's the problem with Indian girls.
It's all "after we're married."

787
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:16.648 line:82%
If you're in such a rush,
find an English girl.

788
01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.274 line:82%
"After we're married."

789
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.102 line:82%
Raj.

790
01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:39.439 line:82%
People come and go from our lives
without us realizing it.

791
01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:45.528 line:82%
Raj came into my life and my life changed.

792
01:12:47.614 --> 01:12:52.535 line:82%
Daddy's gone from my life
and once again my life has changed.

793
01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:58.124 line:82%
l don't know what else
life has in store for me.

794
01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:04.005 line:82%
As soon as we think
we have control of our lives,

795
01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:06.633 line:82%
life takes control.

796
01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:11.054 line:82%
We can't make any major decisions
on our own.

797
01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.640 line:82%
Life decides them for us.

798
01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:18.144 line:82%
But my life's decisions
have always been connected to you.

799
01:13:19.813 --> 01:13:24.692 line:82%
l lost my mother and your mother
made up for that loss.

800
01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:29.823 line:82%
Even now you're the one
who brought Raj to me.

801
01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.784 line:82%
You're the one who gave me my life.

802
01:13:33.118 --> 01:13:36.329 line:82%
l haven't given you your life,
I've given you mine.

803
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:41.626 line:82%
Hey, Tina, look what I've got for you.
Hot parathas.

804
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:44.420 line:82%
-No, Raj.
-What do you mean?

805
01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:46.923 line:82%
You haven't eaten properly
in the last 15 days.

806
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.592 line:82%
Come on, no excuses today.
Let's all eat together.

807
01:13:51.678 --> 01:13:55.515 line:82%
-Excellent parathas.
-Mr. America, you're very ill-mannered.

808
01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:58.600 line:82%
-Why is that?
-Are you going to eat by yourself?

809
01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:01.271 line:82%
I'm not stopping you.
Why don't you join me?

810
01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:06.234 line:82%
No, you have to feed me.
It's more fun when someone else feeds you.

811
01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:09.070 line:82%
Excuse me.

812
01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.031 line:82%
I'm waiting.

813
01:14:20.582 --> 01:14:22.083 line:82%
Hey, Tina.

814
01:14:36.598 --> 01:14:38.766 line:82%
The school authorities.

815
01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:42.145 line:82%
They want the house back
for the new principal.

816
01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:47.025 line:82%
We'll have to think of something for Tina.
She's all alone now.

817
01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:49.569 line:82%
How can you say that?

818
01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:53.156 line:82%
She's like our daughter,
she'll live with us.

819
01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:57.118 line:82%
Only until the day she marries, Raj.

820
01:14:57.327 --> 01:14:59.996 line:82%
-Ranjit?
-Yes, Gurmeet.

821
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.625 line:82%
l promised Arjun right here
that Tina would marry Raj

822
01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.252 line:82%
and I'm going to keep that promise.

823
01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:09.965 line:82%
The astrologer can decide
on an auspicious date tomorrow.

824
01:15:10.048 --> 01:15:12.467 line:82%
Arjun always used to say,

825
01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:17.555 line:82%
"When I give Tina away,
l won't even shed a tear."

826
01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:21.059 line:82%
Tina is like a daughter to me.
I'll give her away.

827
01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:36.157 line:82%
I'm really disappointed, Tina.
l bought you delicious chocolates.

828
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:39.202 line:82%
In return,
l should've at least gotten a smile,

829
01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:42.205 line:82%
but there doesn't seem to be
a hint of that.

830
01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:46.084 line:82%
Careful now, I can see
the beginnings of a smile on your face.

831
01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:49.254 line:82%
What's this? A full smile.
What if someone sees you?

832
01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:52.382 line:82%
Stop it, Raj.
Thanks for being there for me.

833
01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:53.925 line:82%
Thanks for smiling.

834
01:15:55.176 --> 01:16:00.098 line:82%
l want to tell you something, Raj.
Something I should've told you long ago.

835
01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.935 line:82%
You traveled all the way to India
just to hear it.

836
01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:08.731 line:82%
But I only realized
after you left that l...

837
01:16:08.815 --> 01:16:11.234 line:82%
It's getting too late.

838
01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:14.946 line:82%
-Good night, Tina.
-Hey.

839
01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:18.658 line:82%
That's not how you say good night
in London.

840
01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:21.703 line:82%
You need to be a little closer.

841
01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.539 line:82%
Your eyes need to be closed.

842
01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:28.418 line:82%
I love you, Raj. I love you.

843
01:16:43.433 --> 01:16:47.020 line:82%
Pooja, where were you last night?

844
01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:52.567 line:82%
You went to bed so early.
l was only a little late.

845
01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:55.320 line:82%
Not a little late, Raj. It was too late.

846
01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:59.032 line:82%
-Whenever you think best.
-The date suits me fine.

847
01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:02.118 line:82%
-Give me a hug.
-Pooja, how about some sweets?

848
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.870 line:82%
-Sure, why not?
-One minute.

849
01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.205 line:82%
Hey, Astrologer,
any second chances for me?

850
01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:09.375 line:82%
-Stop it. I'm going to tell Tina.
-Okay, okay.

851
01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:23.514 line:82%
l can't believe you're getting married.
When did you grow up, my baby?

852
01:17:23.598 --> 01:17:27.602 line:82%
He deserves a sweet.
Hey, bring up some sweets.

853
01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.781 line:82%
-Raj, look who's here.
-Welcome, welcome.

854
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.076 line:82%
Tina dear, your engagement is fixed.

855
01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.744 line:82%
Only three months away.

856
01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:48.706 line:82%
But no waiting after the engagement.
The wedding is two weeks later.

857
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:51.542 line:82%
Both the wedding and the engagement
will be in London.

858
01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:56.047 line:82%
You're the boy's mother.
We have to agree to everything you say.

859
01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:57.799 line:82%
-Tina.
-Pooja.

860
01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:02.011 line:82%
I'm very happy for you.

861
01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.516 line:82%
Here's a gift from me, a token.

862
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.978 line:82%
l wish I could've given you the
family bracelets, but they're in London,

863
01:18:11.062 --> 01:18:14.232 line:82%
so let them be your wedding gift.

864
01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:16.943 line:82%
l won't forget. I'll look forward to it.

865
01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.488 line:82%
They look so cute together.
God spare them the evil eye.

866
01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:23.866 line:82%
But we won't spare a photo, will we?

867
01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:38.005 line:82%
-What are you praying for?
-Courage.

868
01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:40.675 line:82%
Courage? For what?

869
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:44.262 line:82%
That I can bear seeing
you and Tina marry.

870
01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:47.181 line:82%
What rubbish. I can't marry Tina.

871
01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:52.770 line:82%
Come with me,
let's tell everyone the truth. Come on.

872
01:18:54.522 --> 01:18:57.233 line:82%
No, Raj, it's too late now.

873
01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:01.696 line:82%
Tina has nothing but your love.

874
01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:08.744 line:82%
She's all alone.
If she loses this, she'll break down.

875
01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:10.918 line:82%
Will she?

876
01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:17.170 line:82%
What about when she knows that the man
she's marrying loves someone else?

877
01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:22.008 line:82%
And don't say marriage needs compromise.
How many marriages has it ruined?

878
01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:26.012 line:82%
These things should've been buried
and gone in the last century.

879
01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:29.056 line:82%
A marriage is a faith,

880
01:19:29.599 --> 01:19:32.977 line:82%
love is a promise we make to each other.

881
01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:36.814 line:82%
It was also a promise
your father made to Tina's father,

882
01:19:37.023 --> 01:19:39.901 line:82%
a promise made in friendship.
Friendship,

883
01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:44.739 line:82%
which is above all other relationships.
Every relationship begins with it.

884
01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:47.408 line:82%
Now friendship is killing a relationship.

885
01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:50.786 line:82%
Our relationship hasn't ended.

886
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:53.706 line:82%
All relationships change with time.

887
01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:58.753 line:82%
Ours began with a friendship,
and now, again, we're...

888
01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:03.216 line:82%
What are we, Pooja?
Are we going to be friends again?

889
01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:10.473 line:82%
This isn't easy for me, Raj.
But I can't make Tina unhappy.

890
01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:15.978 line:82%
How can I ask her to
give me the Raj she loves?

891
01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:18.898 line:82%
How can you tell your parents

892
01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:22.151 line:82%
to forget the promise they made
to their friend who's no more?

893
01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:25.947 line:82%
No, Raj. Marry Tina.
It's best for everyone.

894
01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:30.826 line:82%
You say you love me.
Then for the sake of my love...

895
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:36.874 line:82%
Begging in the name of love is easy,
but acting in the name of love is hard.

896
01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:39.544 line:82%
That's what makes it a sacrifice.

897
01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:41.921 line:82%
Fine.

898
01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:47.051 line:82%
If it's for the sake of your love,
l won't let you down.

899
01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:53.808 line:82%
l will make the sacrifice.
For the sake of your love, I'll do it.

900
01:20:56.269 --> 01:20:59.355 line:82%
But I'm not making this sacrifice alone.

901
01:21:00.565 --> 01:21:04.026 line:82%
For the sake of our love,
you'll make a sacrifice too.

902
01:21:05.403 --> 01:21:07.446 line:82%
We'll make the sacrifice together.

903
01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:11.409 line:82%
l swear by you, Pooja,

904
01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:16.789 line:82%
l will marry Tina without fail,

905
01:21:17.582 --> 01:21:22.044 line:82%
but only on the day
that you marry someone else.

906
01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:28.593 line:82%
Yes, Pooja, only on the day
that you marry someone else.

907
01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:34.056 line:82%
I'll marry Tina only on that day.

908
01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.644 line:82%
l promise.

909
01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:43.649 line:82%
Wound in my heart

910
01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:48.362 line:82%
A wound I conceal

911
01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:53.618 line:82%
It's a wound my beloved gave me

912
01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:59.165 line:82%
Alas, my wound can never heal

913
01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:03.544 line:82%
And ever since you went away

914
01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:08.883 line:82%
Even my heart I cannot feel

915
01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:14.305 line:82%
Even my heart I cannot feel

916
01:22:14.764 --> 01:22:19.060 line:82%
Only God knows how long
You've been in my heart

917
01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:24.732 line:82%
It seems you've always been with me

918
01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:28.277 line:82%
l promise...

919
01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:35.117 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

920
01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:39.997 line:82%
There will never be another in my heart

921
01:23:44.979 --> 01:23:47.273 line:82%
Tina, it's you.

922
01:23:52.487 --> 01:23:55.782 line:82%
Raj, I love you.

923
01:23:55.876 --> 01:23:59.158 line:82%
-And I have missed you so much.
-I'm so happy to see you.

924
01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.996 line:82%
-Raj, how did you do that?
-Don't be too impressed.

925
01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:05.666 line:82%
I've a friend who works in the airport.
And a friend in need is a friend indeed.

926
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:07.249 line:82%
-Right, Pooja?
-Yeah, Raj.

927
01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:09.295 line:82%
-How are you, Pooja?
-Good, and you?

01:37:37.561 --> 01:37:40.355 line:82%
Up early? Something important?

1083
01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:41.982 line:82%
Tina...

1084
01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:45.277 line:82%
-Son, consider this your home.
-And put on some muscle.

1085
01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:51.449 line:82%
-Excuse me, come with me.
-Where to? So early in the morning?

1086
01:37:51.533 --> 01:37:52.592 line:82%
Shameless.

1087
01:37:53.952 --> 01:37:57.831 line:82%
-Rohan, you're a good singer.
-l can sing too.

1088
01:37:58.999 --> 01:38:00.875 line:82%
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

1089
01:38:01.293 --> 01:38:07.173 line:82%
But seriously, Rohan, Raj isn't here,
so what are you doing here?

1090
01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:11.052 line:82%
l was just passing by. Thought I'd say hi.

1091
01:38:11.136 --> 01:38:12.469 line:82%
Now?

1092
01:38:12.554 --> 01:38:17.475 line:82%
Tina, you're too much.
Rohan, don't mind her. She's like that.

1093
01:38:17.559 --> 01:38:21.605 line:82%
-What would you like? Some tea?
-Yes, I think I need it now.

1094
01:38:21.688 --> 01:38:25.275 line:82%
-I'll have some tea too.
-Come on, Uncle.

1095
01:38:25.358 --> 01:38:28.236 line:82%
-What about tea?
-I'll make tea for you. Come on.

1096
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.363 line:82%
-Okay, have tea.
-l will.

1097
01:38:30.447 --> 01:38:31.906 line:82%
-Bye, Rohan.
-Bye.

1098
01:38:33.617 --> 01:38:36.911 line:82%
-Sweet girl.
-Follow me, come on.

1099
01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:38.079 line:82%
For me?

1100
01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:51.760 line:82%
Look, I know why you're here,
but I'm not going to lead you on.

1101
01:38:54.346 --> 01:38:55.972 line:82%
You're a really nice guy, Rohan,

1102
01:38:57.182 --> 01:39:00.560 line:82%
and I know that you would make
any girl really happy,

1103
01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:02.646 line:82%
but I'm not ready yet.

1104
01:39:03.521 --> 01:39:05.732 line:82%
I'm not ready for marriage.

1105
01:39:05.815 --> 01:39:08.151 line:82%
Who said I was ready?

1106
01:39:11.071 --> 01:39:14.491 line:82%
What do you think? I go around
chasing girls all over the place?

1107
01:39:16.326 --> 01:39:19.454 line:82%
You know, Pooja,
l don't believe in arranged marriages.

1108
01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:22.666 line:82%
l just happened to see your photo...

1109
01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:28.922 line:82%
and I don't know why,
l felt I had to meet you.

1110
01:39:30.632 --> 01:39:35.261 line:82%
Then I heard that you weren't ready
to meet, so I forgot all about it.

1111
01:39:36.596 --> 01:39:40.100 line:82%
Then all of a sudden, yesterday,
there you were,

1112
01:39:41.601 --> 01:39:44.979 line:82%
and I thought you could use a friend.

1113
01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:50.235 line:82%
That's why I'm here,
just to get to know you better.

1114
01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:56.491 line:82%
No promises, no strings, just friendship.

1115
01:39:57.117 --> 01:39:59.828 line:82%
If nothing else, you'll make a friend.

1116
01:40:01.454 --> 01:40:02.872 line:82%
Will you be my friend?

1117
01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:08.253 line:82%
Try me. My friends say I'm a good friend.

1118
01:40:11.089 --> 01:40:14.676 line:82%
Let me warn you, Pooja,
when girls make friends with me,

1119
01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.096 line:82%
the friendship usually changes into love.

1120
01:40:18.304 --> 01:40:21.641 line:82%
-Tea?
-Here or somewhere else?

1121
01:40:21.725 --> 01:40:22.976 line:82%
Rohan.

1122
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:30.293 line:82%
Raj.

1123
01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:35.238 line:82%
You don't have to tell me, I know.
What are you doing? Thinking about me?

1124
01:40:35.655 --> 01:40:37.282 line:82%
What else do I do in the office?

1125
01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:39.993 line:82%
-Liar.
-That's right, I was working.

1126
01:40:40.326 --> 01:40:44.631 line:82%
-Your lies are better than the truth.
-Okay, don't disturb me. Let me work.

1127
01:40:44.706 --> 01:40:47.834 line:82%
Working? Ten days before our wedding?

1128
01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:52.380 line:82%
Ten days and so much to do.

1129
01:40:52.839 --> 01:40:57.886 line:82%
Enough. Take me out.
I'm bored sitting at home.

1130
01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:01.681 line:82%
We'll go out this evening.
Go shopping with Pooja.

1131
01:41:02.182 --> 01:41:05.351 line:82%
Pooja's out. Why else would I call you?

1132
01:41:05.435 --> 01:41:07.312 line:82%
Gone out? Where?

1133
01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:09.731 line:82%
-To the movies with Rohan.
-With Rohan?

1134
01:41:09.814 --> 01:41:11.691 line:82%
Yes, he's too cool.

1135
01:41:11.775 --> 01:41:15.278 line:82%
l think they have something going.
Wouldn't that be great?

1136
01:41:15.365 --> 01:41:19.199 line:82%
-Yeah. Where'd they go?
-How should I know?

1137
01:41:19.282 --> 01:41:22.911 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America, tell me now,
are you taking me out or not?

1138
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:27.665 line:82%
Hey, Miss Universe,
I'll be there in ten minutes. Be ready.

1139
01:41:27.999 --> 01:41:30.126 line:82%
-I love you, Raj!
-Bye.

1140
01:41:53.191 --> 01:41:57.278 line:82%
The film starts in three minutes.
l don't want to miss the beginning.

1141
01:41:57.362 --> 01:42:00.031 line:82%
We're next.
You won't miss the beginning.

1142
01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.451 line:82%
Even the line for the popcorn is long.

1143
01:42:03.535 --> 01:42:07.330 line:82%
Up to you. The beginning of the movie
or popcorn? Decide.

1144
01:42:08.331 --> 01:42:11.626 line:82%
Okay, go watch the beginning,
I'll get the popcorn.

1145
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:14.045 line:82%
-Raj, you're so sweet.
-Next, please.

1146
01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:21.970 line:82%
-Two popcorns.
-Hey, make that four.

1147
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.849 line:82%
-Where were you guys?
-Showing Pooja around London.

1148
01:42:25.932 --> 01:42:30.645 line:82%
But she's seen everything already.
so I figured we'd catch a movie.

1149
01:42:30.728 --> 01:42:33.439 line:82%
-Maybe she hasn't seen it already.
-Where's Tina?

1150
01:42:33.523 --> 01:42:37.652 line:82%
-Inside. She wanted to catch the start.
-The movie has started?

1151
01:42:37.735 --> 01:42:43.116 line:82%
Then what are we doing here?
Come on, let's go. Raj, you talk too much.

1152
01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:44.367 line:82%
Thank you.

1153
01:42:49.831 --> 01:42:51.332 line:82%
-Hi, Pooja.
-Hi.

1154
01:42:51.416 --> 01:42:54.252 line:82%
-What are you doing here?
-Playing cricket.

1155
01:42:54.335 --> 01:42:56.880 line:82%
Anyways, never mind.
The movie's started.

1156
01:43:12.437 --> 01:43:16.274 line:82%
Raj, where did you learn to make
such wonderful chicken tikka?

1157
01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:20.445 line:82%
-Rohan, are those scratches on your arm?
-Take a look.

1158
01:43:20.653 --> 01:43:25.199 line:82%
Look, fingernail scratches.

1159
01:43:25.283 --> 01:43:27.285 line:82%
Look what your daughter did to my arm.

1160
01:43:27.327 --> 01:43:28.369 line:82%
What?

1161
01:43:28.453 --> 01:43:31.247 line:82%
That's why I never sit next to Pooja
when I watch a horror movie.

1162
01:43:31.331 --> 01:43:34.500 line:82%
And you don't even want to know
what she's like on an airplane.

1163
01:43:34.584 --> 01:43:40.214 line:82%
When she was a kid, I clipped her nails.
Now she won't listen anymore.

1164
01:43:40.965 --> 01:43:43.635 line:82%
Papa, they're making fun of me.

1165
01:43:43.718 --> 01:43:45.929 line:82%
Look, she just scratched me!

1166
01:43:47.096 --> 01:43:49.057 line:82%
I'm lucky it was only 90 minutes.

1167
01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:52.977 line:82%
Had it been a Hindi film,
I'd have said goodbye to my arm.

1168
01:43:53.061 --> 01:43:55.939 line:82%
Laugh it up.
l hope you're enjoying yourselves.

1169
01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:59.984 line:82%
Darling, are you angry?
It's all just a bit of comedy.

1170
01:44:00.193 --> 01:44:02.487 line:82%
-Tina, this is all your fault.
-Really?

1171
01:44:02.582 --> 01:44:06.656 line:82%
-Now go and pacify my daughter.
-I'll do that.

1172
01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:09.171 line:82%
Yes, only my Raj can pacify her.

1173
01:44:09.744 --> 01:44:12.121 line:82%
Hey, Raj, I'll go.

1174
01:44:13.164 --> 01:44:14.203 line:82%
Sure.

1175
01:44:21.798 --> 01:44:25.393 line:82%
Somebody said that being friends
means never having to say you're sorry.

1176
01:44:25.885 --> 01:44:27.470 line:82%
Still, I've come to apologize.

1177
01:44:30.181 --> 01:44:33.828 line:82%
If you're friends you don't do something
that you have to apologize for.

1178
01:44:34.352 --> 01:44:36.354 line:82%
You're right, but what can I do?

1179
01:44:36.437 --> 01:44:39.524 line:82%
If I'm in the mood for a joke,
I sometimes cross the line.

1180
01:44:41.651 --> 01:44:43.835 line:82%
Did I cross the line this time?

1181
01:44:46.322 --> 01:44:49.659 line:82%
Rohan you're too much.
Nobody can stay angry with you.

1182
01:44:49.909 --> 01:44:52.620 line:82%
That's because I'm so cute and adorable.

1183
01:44:53.371 --> 01:44:57.041 line:82%
Okay, Mr. Cute-and-adorable,
it's late. Good night.

1184
01:44:57.333 --> 01:45:01.713 line:82%
Good night? That means get out.
Okay, I'm going.

1185
01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.257 line:82%
-Bye.
-Bye.

1186
01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.051 line:82%
-Good night.
-Good night.

1187
01:45:08.469 --> 01:45:11.431 line:82%
-You've calmed down, right?
-Yes, Rohan.

1188
01:45:12.765 --> 01:45:13.891 line:82%
Just checking.

1189
01:45:15.435 --> 01:45:18.187 line:82%
-So we're still friends, right?
-Yes.

1190
01:45:20.106 --> 01:45:23.108 line:82%
-So we'll see each other tomorrow, right?
-Yes, Rohan.

1191
01:45:23.192 --> 01:45:24.235 line:82%
Cool.

1192
01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:28.031 line:82%
-Will you marry me?
-What?

1193
01:45:28.823 --> 01:45:31.743 line:82%
You were saying yes to everything,
so I thought I'd give it a shot.

1194
01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:34.662 line:82%
-Rohan.
-Is that a yes or a no?

1195
01:45:36.581 --> 01:45:38.113 line:82%
That's a no.

1196
01:45:38.207 --> 01:45:40.376 line:82%
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

1197
01:45:41.711 --> 01:45:42.879 line:82%
Rohan.

1198
01:45:47.008 --> 01:45:48.176 line:82%
Raj.

1199
01:45:58.561 --> 01:45:59.562 line:82%
Raj.

1200
01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.003 line:82%
Tina.

1201
01:46:27.131 --> 01:46:28.424 line:82%
Penny for your thoughts.

1202
01:46:28.674 --> 01:46:32.929 line:82%
I'm starting a new chapter of my life,

1203
01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:36.581 line:82%
but it's based on a lie.

1204
01:46:37.225 --> 01:46:39.852 line:82%
Before I start this new life,

1205
01:46:39.936 --> 01:46:44.398 line:82%
l want to tell Raj the truth,
that I didn't write those letters.

1206
01:46:45.566 --> 01:46:50.697 line:82%
Tina, forget about the past.
The important thing is,

1207
01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:54.992 line:82%
you love Raj and you're marrying him.
Nothing else matters.

1208
01:46:55.076 --> 01:46:58.641 line:82%
-But, Pooja--
-No buts. You're the one who says

1209
01:46:58.746 --> 01:47:01.958 line:82%
if you hang on to old memories,
you won't create new ones.

1210
01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:04.418 line:82%
So, come on, forget the past.
Come on. Let's go.

1211
01:47:04.502 --> 01:47:06.462 line:82%
-Pooja.
-Tina.

1212
01:47:10.633 --> 01:47:12.552 line:82%
Hey, Raj. Look at this.

1213
01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:14.988 line:82%
Do you think Pooja will like it?

1214
01:47:16.305 --> 01:47:19.225 line:82%
No, Pooja would never wear that color.

1215
01:47:20.351 --> 01:47:22.269 line:82%
Then which color does she like?

1216
01:47:22.353 --> 01:47:24.814 line:82%
Green, Raj loves green.

1217
01:47:24.897 --> 01:47:28.234 line:82%
Tell me more about what Raj likes.

1218
01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:32.080 line:82%
You used to talk about him all the time,
but not anymore.

1219
01:47:32.155 --> 01:47:35.908 line:82%
She loves the little things,
popcorn, books.

1220
01:47:35.992 --> 01:47:37.118 line:82%
Gobi parathas.

1221
01:47:37.326 --> 01:47:38.744 line:82%
Songs from old Hindi films.

1222
01:47:38.828 --> 01:47:40.446 line:82%
Raj is a very different kind of guy.

1223
01:47:40.637 --> 01:47:42.665 line:82%
Pooja is a completely different sort.

1224
01:47:44.417 --> 01:47:46.318 line:82%
And you never fell in love with Raj?

1225
01:47:47.837 --> 01:47:51.007 line:82%
l did, but you stole him from me.

1226
01:47:55.303 --> 01:47:57.430 line:82%
-Just joking.
-Pooja.

1227
01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.975 line:82%
-Here they are.
-Shopping done?

1228
01:48:01.058 --> 01:48:02.226 line:82%
Let's pay.

1229
01:48:16.157 --> 01:48:19.827 line:82%
Hey, Love Story. Can I buy this for you?

1230
01:48:19.911 --> 01:48:22.580 line:82%
No, thanks. I already have Love Story.

1231
01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:25.166 line:82%
You can only have one love story.

1232
01:48:25.249 --> 01:48:26.709 line:82%
Pooja, come on, let's go.

1233
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:30.630 line:82%
But I haven't a love story.

1234
01:48:31.172 --> 01:48:33.049 line:82%
I must buy it. This one too.

1235
01:48:33.299 --> 01:48:38.304 line:82%
This better be a nice picture.
Back home in India, I'm a VIP.

1236
01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:47.605 line:82%
The bride's people are always
thrown out of the picture.

1237
01:48:48.147 --> 01:48:50.775 line:82%
How can this family be complete
without me?

1238
01:48:59.659 --> 01:49:03.162 line:82%
Pictures. And nobody told me?

1239
01:49:03.246 --> 01:49:05.832 line:82%
Now you know what we think of you.

1240
01:49:05.915 --> 01:49:09.001 line:82%
At least you think about me.

1241
01:49:13.173 --> 01:49:14.257 line:82%
Excuse me.

1242
01:49:17.177 --> 01:49:18.469 line:82%
What am I doing here?

1243
01:49:20.263 --> 01:49:22.682 line:82%
-Tina, where are you going?
-I'll be right back.

1244
01:49:23.516 --> 01:49:26.644 line:82%
If you won't marry me,
at least take a picture with me.

1245
01:49:26.727 --> 01:49:32.358 line:82%
I can show it around. I'll say I tried
my best, but she wouldn't have me.

1246
01:49:35.736 --> 01:49:39.323 line:82%
-Raj, he's the boy I want for Pooja.
-Okay.

1247
01:49:40.283 --> 01:49:43.369 line:82%
You can convince her. Talk to her.

1248
01:49:46.289 --> 01:49:51.627 line:82%
They look good together, don't they?
l think Pooja will agree to marry Rohan.

1249
01:49:51.711 --> 01:49:53.671 line:82%
What do you think?

1250
01:49:54.505 --> 01:49:56.632 line:82%
I'm waiting for her to agree too.

1251
01:49:58.342 --> 01:50:00.011 line:82%
I'm waiting for her to say yes.

1252
01:50:17.903 --> 01:50:19.655 line:82%
You wanted to see me?

1253
01:50:19.739 --> 01:50:21.157 line:82%
Hi, Pooja.

1254
01:50:22.533 --> 01:50:23.569 line:82%
Chips?

1255
01:50:27.872 --> 01:50:30.583 line:82%
Pooja, I have to talk to you
about something important.

1256
01:50:31.876 --> 01:50:34.086 line:82%
Your mom gave me a big responsibility.

1257
01:50:36.255 --> 01:50:37.840 line:82%
She approves of Rohan.

1258
01:50:39.633 --> 01:50:43.387 line:82%
She thinks I'm the only one
who can talk to you about him,

1259
01:50:46.098 --> 01:50:50.019 line:82%
that I'm the only one who can
convince you to marry him.

1260
01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:54.523 line:82%
What do you think?

1261
01:50:56.525 --> 01:50:57.565 line:82%
Stop it.

1262
01:50:59.695 --> 01:51:03.324 line:82%
I'm not joking, Pooja.
l have to give your mother an answer.

1263
01:51:05.493 --> 01:51:06.952 line:82%
What should I tell her?

1264
01:51:08.829 --> 01:51:11.957 line:82%
l can't say yes to marrying someone.

1265
01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:16.504 line:82%
Why not? In our country,
arranged marriages are very common.

1266
01:51:17.338 --> 01:51:19.340 line:82%
Our parents' marriages were arranged.

1267
01:51:19.965 --> 01:51:22.009 line:82%
They hadn't even met each other.

1268
01:51:22.093 --> 01:51:27.932 line:82%
You know Rohan and from what I see,
you seem to like him.

1269
01:51:31.435 --> 01:51:33.896 line:82%
Of course, if you're in love
with someone else,

1270
01:51:34.855 --> 01:51:36.315 line:82%
that's different.

1271
01:51:40.569 --> 01:51:42.738 line:82%
Are you in love with someone else?

1272
01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:49.286 line:82%
Tell me, Pooja, are you in love
with someone else?

1273
01:51:50.413 --> 01:51:52.498 line:82%
Stop it, Raj, stop it.

1274
01:51:52.581 --> 01:51:56.669 line:82%
Stop it. That's exactly what
I've been wanting to tell you, Pooja.

1275
01:51:56.752 --> 01:51:59.130 line:82%
Stop it. Stop it now.

1276
01:52:02.049 --> 01:52:04.635 line:82%
Do you enjoy playing
with people's hearts?

1277
01:52:05.594 --> 01:52:09.140 line:82%
First me, then Tina, then Rohan,
and now your parents too.

1278
01:52:11.517 --> 01:52:13.727 line:82%
How many hearts
do you want to break, Pooja?

1279
01:52:15.187 --> 01:52:17.731 line:82%
How many hearts do you want to play with?

1280
01:52:19.066 --> 01:52:21.652 line:82%
What you call play could be real.

1281
01:52:21.735 --> 01:52:24.864 line:82%
Turn this lie into the truth, Pooja,
l dare you.

1282
01:52:25.364 --> 01:52:29.076 line:82%
Agree to marry Rohan, I dare you.

1283
01:52:37.251 --> 01:52:41.255 line:82%
You will never agree to marry, Rohan.

1284
01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:45.676 line:82%
You love me too much, Pooja.

1285
01:52:47.845 --> 01:52:50.347 line:82%
You'll never belong to anyone else.

1286
01:52:53.184 --> 01:52:55.394 line:82%
You love me too much, Pooja.

1287
01:52:58.439 --> 01:53:01.859 line:82%
Enough, Raj. Enough. Stop it now.

1288
01:53:01.942 --> 01:53:07.031 line:82%
Not before you say yes to Rohan.

1289
01:53:09.867 --> 01:53:11.952 line:82%
Then will I hold my silence.

1290
01:53:13.662 --> 01:53:16.582 line:82%
Seven days from now,
Tina and I are getting married.

1291
01:53:17.333 --> 01:53:22.046 line:82%
Listen carefully. Now it's your turn
to make the sacrifice.

1292
01:53:23.547 --> 01:53:26.467 line:82%
If by tomorrow
you haven't said yes to Rohan,

1293
01:53:26.967 --> 01:53:29.803 line:82%
I'll announce in front of everyone
that I love you.

1294
01:53:31.597 --> 01:53:36.393 line:82%
Tomorrow, nobody will be able to stop me.
Tomorrow, don't even try to stop me.

1295
01:53:37.478 --> 01:53:38.854 line:82%
Now you can go.

1296
01:54:08.968 --> 01:54:14.932 line:82%
What desire ravages my heart?

1297
01:54:17.977 --> 01:54:23.816 line:82%
If you ask, I will tell you

1298
01:54:28.862 --> 01:54:33.492 line:82%
Not gold, not diamonds

1299
01:54:33.867 --> 01:54:37.329 line:82%
They are no use to me

1300
01:54:38.497 --> 01:54:43.127 line:82%
Not mansions, not cars

1301
01:54:43.794 --> 01:54:47.172 line:82%
They are no more than showpieces

1302
01:54:48.757 --> 01:54:53.178 line:82%
Give me a heart if you will
Take my heart if you will

1303
01:54:53.637 --> 01:54:57.975 line:82%
Give me a heart if you will
Take my heart if you will

1304
01:54:58.475 --> 01:55:03.082 line:82%
Take, take all I have

1305
01:55:03.147 --> 01:55:06.025 line:82%
But there's no trade in love

1306
01:55:08.694 --> 01:55:12.531 line:82%
Take, take all I have

1307
01:55:13.282 --> 01:55:16.327 line:82%
But there's no trade in love

1308
01:55:17.953 --> 01:55:20.581 line:82%
That's a lie

1309
01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:25.544 line:82%
If you tell a lie, a crow will bite you

1310
01:55:26.295 --> 01:55:28.714 line:82%
You should be afraid of the black crow

1311
01:55:28.922 --> 01:55:31.425 line:82%
I'll go back to my house

1312
01:55:31.508 --> 01:55:33.761 line:82%
You wait and see

1313
01:55:33.863 --> 01:55:36.305 line:82%
I'll go back to my house

1314
01:55:36.388 --> 01:55:38.557 line:82%
You wait and see

1315
01:55:39.183 --> 01:55:44.772 line:82%
If you tell a lie, a crow will bite you

1316
01:55:45.022 --> 01:55:47.316 line:82%
You should be afraid of the black crow

1317
01:55:47.566 --> 01:55:52.363 line:82%
I'll go back to my house
You wait and see

1318
01:55:52.455 --> 01:55:57.201 line:82%
I'll go back to my house
You wait and see

1319
01:55:57.618 --> 01:56:02.706 line:82%
But the brave will carry
Their brides away

1320
01:56:08.545 --> 01:56:14.259 line:82%
But the brave will carry
Their brides away

1321
01:56:14.468 --> 01:56:19.682 line:82%
But the brave will carry
Their brides away

1322
01:56:19.765 --> 01:56:22.434 line:82%
The brave will carry their brides away

1323
01:56:22.518 --> 01:56:25.688 line:82%
While the bride's people watch

1324
01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:28.440 line:82%
The brave will carry their brides away

1325
01:56:28.774 --> 01:56:30.859 line:82%
While the bride's people watch

1326
01:56:30.943 --> 01:56:36.740 line:82%
And I will carry my bride away

1327
01:56:42.287 --> 01:56:47.626 line:82%
Don't come looking for me again

1328
01:56:48.043 --> 01:56:53.299 line:82%
Don't come looking for me again

1329
01:56:53.424 --> 01:56:57.720 line:82%
Now we're estranged

1330
01:56:58.345 --> 01:57:02.266 line:82%
Your beloved is no more

1331
01:57:02.349 --> 01:57:06.937 line:82%
Your beloved is no more

1332
01:57:07.688 --> 01:57:10.607 line:82%
So leave with your memories

1333
01:57:10.691 --> 01:57:13.557 line:82%
Memories of laughter and tears

1334
01:57:13.652 --> 01:57:18.031 line:82%
Now we're estranged

1335
01:57:18.115 --> 01:57:22.161 line:82%
Your beloved is no more

1336
01:57:22.411 --> 01:57:26.039 line:82%
Your beloved is no more

1337
01:57:26.915 --> 01:57:32.880 line:82%
Beauties, beware
Here I come

1338
01:57:34.131 --> 01:57:40.095 line:82%
Beauties, beware
Here I come

1339
01:57:41.096 --> 01:57:44.558 line:82%
I'm your Casanova and I'm your foe

1340
01:57:44.975 --> 01:57:47.436 line:82%
I'm different

1341
01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:53.734 line:82%
Beauties, beware
Here I come

1342
01:57:55.778 --> 01:57:58.947 line:82%
What brings you here?

1343
01:57:59.406 --> 01:58:02.284 line:82%
You wanted me to be here

1344
01:58:02.993 --> 01:58:06.371 line:82%
Then you'll tell me why

1345
01:58:06.955 --> 01:58:09.958 line:82%
Only if you'll give me a smile

1346
01:58:10.667 --> 01:58:13.170 line:82%
Why have you come?

1347
01:58:13.462 --> 01:58:17.257 line:82%
I've driven all the way

1348
01:58:23.388 --> 01:58:26.308 line:82%
I've driven all the way

1349
01:58:26.391 --> 01:58:32.356 line:82%
l traveled the roads and highways
Till I came to the crossroads

1350
01:58:32.731 --> 01:58:35.859 line:82%
Where I lost my heart

1351
01:58:36.777 --> 01:58:42.199 line:82%
l traveled the roads and highways
Till I came to the crossroads

1352

God knows, cities and towns flew past

1353
01:58:46.787 --> 01:58:52.740 line:82%
Past Amritsar, then came Lahore

1354
01:58:52.835 --> 01:58:56.421 line:82%
In Lahore, I lost my heart

1355
01:58:56.797 --> 01:59:02.761 line:82%

Where I lost my heart

1356

If you're so silent
Something is surely up

1357
01:59:12.312 --> 01:59:15.566 line:82%

Darling, will you set
The hearts of maidens on fire?

1386
02:01:34.913 --> 02:01:40.210 line:82%
The sight of such beauties

1387
02:01:41.128 --> 02:01:46.675 line:82%
Darling, of course
The men will steal glances

1388
02:01:51.138 --> 02:01:54.599 line:82%
Listen, my heart pines

1389
02:01:54.933 --> 02:01:57.936 line:82%
To hear it

1390
02:01:59.312 --> 02:02:02.607 line:82%
Say you love me

1391
02:02:02.816 --> 02:02:06.028 line:82%
Say you love me

1392
02:02:06.528 --> 02:02:09.364 line:82%
Say you love me

1393
02:02:09.865 --> 02:02:12.951 line:82%
Say you love me

1394
02:02:14.036 --> 02:02:15.537 line:82%
From love

1395
02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:17.456 line:82%
You and I came to be

1396
02:02:17.539 --> 02:02:18.957 line:82%
From love

1397
02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:21.585 line:82%
Came all of creation

1398
02:02:22.085 --> 02:02:25.297 line:82%
Say you love me

1399
02:02:25.714 --> 02:02:28.967 line:82%
Say you love me

1400
02:02:29.301 --> 02:02:32.054 line:82%
Say you love me

1401
02:02:32.554 --> 02:02:35.265 line:82%
Say you love me

1402
02:02:42.105 --> 02:02:45.567 line:82%
Ours is a strange story

1403
02:02:46.234 --> 02:02:49.946 line:82%
Where did it begin, where will it end?

1404
02:02:50.489 --> 02:02:54.284 line:82%
What are we destined for?

1405
02:02:54.785 --> 02:02:58.747 line:82%
He doesn't know and I don't know

1406
02:02:59.247 --> 02:03:02.793 line:82%
Congratulations

1407
02:03:03.710 --> 02:03:07.005 line:82%
You have found someone's love

1408
02:03:08.048 --> 02:03:11.593 line:82%
You are so close to her

1409
02:03:12.344 --> 02:03:16.056 line:82%
And now you're distant from me

1410
02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:19.601 line:82%
Ours is a strange story

1411
02:03:24.064 --> 02:03:27.359 line:82%
But who knows what tomorrow holds?

1412
02:03:27.984 --> 02:03:31.446 line:82%
Life is a wonderful journey

1413
02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:35.992 line:82%
And no one knows what tomorrow holds

1414
02:03:59.599 --> 02:04:01.726 line:82%
You came up to me

1415
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:04.604 line:82%
Then you smiled

1416
02:04:06.439 --> 02:04:11.027 line:82%
You came to me and with a smile

1417
02:04:11.903 --> 02:04:16.700 line:82%
You gave me such wonderful dreams

1418
02:04:17.159 --> 02:04:22.372 line:82%
Dreamlike, I am always awake

1419
02:04:22.914 --> 02:04:28.253 line:82%
Alas, something is happening to me

1420
02:04:28.336 --> 02:04:33.758 line:82%
Something is happening to me

1421
02:04:33.842 --> 02:04:36.728 line:82%
Something is happening to me

1422
02:04:36.803 --> 02:04:39.514 line:82%
Something is happening to me

1423
02:04:40.932 --> 02:04:43.185 line:82%
Wear the color of the henna

1424
02:04:43.268 --> 02:04:46.155 line:82%
Make sure the bride's palanquin
Is decked with flowers

1425
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:50.442 line:82%
The henna stain and the hues
Of flowers, remember

1426
02:04:50.734 --> 02:04:55.697 line:82%
For your beloved is coming
To take you away

1427
02:04:55.947 --> 02:05:00.202 line:82%
Wear the color of the henna

1428
02:05:00.744 --> 02:05:05.207 line:82%
Wear the color of the henna

1429
02:05:05.665 --> 02:05:10.670 line:82%
For your beloved is coming
To take you away

1430
02:05:10.754 --> 02:05:15.175 line:82%
Wear the color of the henna

1431
02:05:15.634 --> 02:05:20.013 line:82%
Wear the color of the henna

1432
02:05:53.213 --> 02:05:55.131 line:82%
Last night's party was fun.

1433
02:05:55.215 --> 02:05:58.718 line:82%
Thank god the rain came late.

1434
02:05:58.802 --> 02:06:01.638 line:82%
-The rain made it more fun.
-How did I look?

1435
02:06:01.721 --> 02:06:05.976 line:82%
Great. And you danced so well.

1436
02:06:06.476 --> 02:06:08.228 line:82%
-Here, have something.
-No.

1437
02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:09.853 line:82%
-Mama.
-Yes, dear?

1438
02:06:12.065 --> 02:06:13.566 line:82%
I'm ready to marry Rohan.

1439
02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:15.110 line:82%
Pooja, what?

1440
02:06:20.824 --> 02:06:26.788 line:82%
-Your daughter said yes.
-What, wife? Are you saying yes?

1441
02:06:27.038 --> 02:06:32.419 line:82%
Sorry. Or was it my daughter?
Pooja, soon I'm going to marry too.

1442
02:06:32.919 --> 02:06:35.463 line:82%
Watch what you say.
It's your daughter's wedding.

1443
02:06:35.547 --> 02:06:38.100 line:82%
Let's have two weddings
on the same day.

1444
02:06:38.174 --> 02:06:40.510 line:82%
-I'll give Mrs. Verma the good news.
-Do that.

1445
02:06:40.969 --> 02:06:44.139 line:82%
We're getting married on the same day.
I'm going to call Rohan.

1446
02:06:45.932 --> 02:06:51.563 line:82%
Son, I know that you convinced
Pooja to agree to get married.

1447
02:06:51.813 --> 02:06:54.607 line:82%
You really are a good son. Come here.

1448
02:06:56.359 --> 02:06:58.653 line:82%
Well, what did Mrs. Verma say?

1449
02:07:02.657 --> 02:07:07.162 line:82%
-Congratulations, Pooja.
-Thank you.

1450
02:07:09.247 --> 02:07:13.793 line:82%
Aunt's right.
You're marrying because of me, right?

1451
02:07:20.467 --> 02:07:25.472 line:82%
We're getting married on the same day
to two different people.

1452
02:07:27.682 --> 02:07:30.268 line:82%
What better news could there possibly be?

1453
02:07:35.106 --> 02:07:40.653 line:82%
Rohan will make you very happy.
You couldn't find a nicer guy.

1454
02:07:43.656 --> 02:07:46.034 line:82%
No one could love you more than him.

1455
02:07:49.621 --> 02:07:51.039 line:82%
Pooja.

1456
02:07:52.749 --> 02:07:55.668 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America,
why are you making my friend cry?

1457
02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:00.048 line:82%
You too?

1458
02:08:01.257 --> 02:08:03.468 line:82%
How come I never cry of happiness?

1459
02:08:04.719 --> 02:08:07.927 line:82%
How come I never cry like that?
Not fair.

1460
02:08:09.933 --> 02:08:14.646 line:82%
Sometimes some things

1461
02:08:14.729 --> 02:08:19.609 line:82%
Won't even let me cry

1462
02:08:20.068 --> 02:08:24.989 line:82%
She loves me
But she won't say it

1463
02:08:25.073 --> 02:08:28.284 line:82%
Oh, why?

1464
02:08:30.286 --> 02:08:34.749 line:82%
But your eyes are speaking

1465
02:08:35.083 --> 02:08:39.254 line:82%
In silence, you are seeking

1466
02:08:40.130 --> 02:08:44.300 line:82%
In silence, you are seeking

1467
02:08:56.896 --> 02:09:00.114 line:82%
The first time the four of us
were together was in this hall.

1468
02:09:00.191 --> 02:09:03.987 line:82%
For our engagement.
Now it's for your engagement.

1469
02:09:04.821 --> 02:09:08.450 line:82%
Who would have guessed
so much would happen so fast?

1470
02:09:10.076 --> 02:09:11.161 line:82%
True.

1471
02:09:12.078 --> 02:09:16.624 line:82%
So much has happened so fast,
hasn't it, Pooja?

1472
02:09:17.625 --> 02:09:21.796 line:82%
Come on, Pooja, answer Raj's question.
The bottle's pointing at you.

1473
02:09:22.172 --> 02:09:23.715 line:82%
Tina.

1474
02:09:23.798 --> 02:09:27.135 line:82%
Let's play spin the bottle.
Whoever the bottle points to

1475
02:09:27.218 --> 02:09:30.750 line:82%
has to answer the question truthfully.

1476
02:09:30.847 --> 02:09:33.224 line:82%
Okay? Let's start.

1477
02:09:33.308 --> 02:09:35.518 line:82%
-I'll spin the bottle.
-Tina...

1478
02:09:38.354 --> 02:09:40.648 line:82%
Rohan, you're first.

1479
02:09:40.732 --> 02:09:42.817 line:82%
Who's asking him the question?

1480
02:09:43.401 --> 02:09:46.112 line:82%
How much do you love Pooja?

1481
02:09:48.031 --> 02:09:51.743 line:82%
As much as you love Tina
plus a little more.

1482
02:09:53.411 --> 02:09:54.746 line:82%
Okay.

1483
02:09:58.082 --> 02:09:59.876 line:82%
-Pooja!
-I'm asking. I'm asking.

1484
02:09:59.959 --> 02:10:01.628 line:82%
Sure, go ahead.

1485
02:10:01.711 --> 02:10:05.924 line:82%
Pooja, why did you agree to marry me?

1486
02:10:08.176 --> 02:10:12.013 line:82%
My best friends are getting married
and I needed a friend.

1487
02:10:12.555 --> 02:10:15.141 line:82%
I hear you can be a good friend.

1488
02:10:15.225 --> 02:10:16.851 line:82%
Which I am.

1489
02:10:17.268 --> 02:10:18.770 line:82%
Okay, next.

1490
02:10:21.147 --> 02:10:22.273 line:82%
Tina!

1491
02:10:22.357 --> 02:10:23.691 line:82%
Your turn.

1492
02:10:25.568 --> 02:10:28.321 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America, this is your chance.

1493
02:10:29.197 --> 02:10:32.408 line:82%
You can ask me whatever you want.

1494
02:10:33.409 --> 02:10:35.578 line:82%
What should I ask?

1495
02:10:36.454 --> 02:10:41.251 line:82%
If you have anything to confess to me,
go ahead.

1496
02:10:41.333 --> 02:10:43.169 line:82%
l have nothing to confess.

1497
02:10:44.712 --> 02:10:46.422 line:82%
Then you're getting off easily.

1498
02:10:47.590 --> 02:10:50.760 line:82%
Wait, I do have something to tell you.

1499
02:10:56.140 --> 02:10:58.184 line:82%
l didn't write those letters, Raj.

1500
02:10:59.978 --> 02:11:02.689 line:82%
We'll be married soon.

1501
02:11:02.897 --> 02:11:05.858 line:82%
l don't want our new life
to begin with a lie.

1502
02:11:07.068 --> 02:11:11.322 line:82%
For 15 years what you believed
to be true is a lie.

1503
02:11:12.407 --> 02:11:17.120 line:82%
l didn't write those letters to you.
l didn't want to lie to you, Raj.

1504
02:11:18.288 --> 02:11:20.915 line:82%
And I can't keep lying to you.

1505
02:11:22.834 --> 02:11:24.877 line:82%
Please forgive me, Raj.

1506
02:11:25.753 --> 02:11:27.171 line:82%
Please forgive me.

1507
02:11:29.841 --> 02:11:32.510 line:82%
You only need to forgive
those you don't love,

1508
02:11:32.594 --> 02:11:35.263 line:82%
the ones you love
you never even get angry with.

1509
02:11:35.346 --> 02:11:36.973 line:82%
Forget the apology.

1510
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:38.433 line:82%
It's okay.

1511
02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:41.686 line:82%
Raj, you're not angry with me?

1512
02:11:42.979 --> 02:11:45.148 line:82%
I've promised you a lifetime.

1513
02:11:46.232 --> 02:11:48.359 line:82%
How can I get angry with you?

1514
02:11:54.949 --> 02:11:57.702 line:82%
This game has gotten far too serious.

1515
02:11:58.911 --> 02:12:03.541 line:82%
Do you know who wrote those letters?
Pooja did.

1516
02:12:05.168 --> 02:12:06.961 line:82%
Then I should be marrying Pooja.

1517
02:12:15.928 --> 02:12:19.307 line:82%
Raj, you turn everything into a joke.

1518
02:12:20.558 --> 02:12:23.519 line:82%
Joke. Yes, this is one big joke.

1519
02:12:25.313 --> 02:12:26.564 line:82%
Next.

1520
02:12:33.655 --> 02:12:37.450 line:82%
Where is Raj? I told him to meet
us at three o'clock outside of Harrod's.

1521
02:12:38.409 --> 02:12:40.161 line:82%
Hey, Mr. America.

1522
02:12:45.875 --> 02:12:47.126 line:82%
Pooja!

1523
02:12:50.546 --> 02:12:51.839 line:82%
Are you all right?

1524
02:13:00.848 --> 02:13:04.268 line:82%
Raj, it's really not important,
but suppose,

1525
02:13:05.478 --> 02:13:09.649 line:82%
just now when we were crossing the road,

1526
02:13:10.733 --> 02:13:14.028 line:82%
you could only save one of us
from being run over by that truck.

1527
02:13:16.030 --> 02:13:20.785 line:82%
Which one would you have saved,
Pooja or me?

1528
02:13:20.868 --> 02:13:22.745 line:82%
Tina, what kind of question is that?

1529
02:13:25.748 --> 02:13:30.378 line:82%
One of them is my love
and the other is my friend.

1530
02:13:32.296 --> 02:13:34.924 line:82%
Of the three of us
if I could save only two,

1531
02:13:35.842 --> 02:13:40.388 line:82%
l would've saved the two of you
and let myself be run over by the truck.

1532
02:13:40.471 --> 02:13:43.850 line:82%
Raj, what rubbish are you talking?
What's come over you two?

1533
02:13:43.933 --> 02:13:47.103 line:82%
What if the choice was between
love and friendship?

1534
02:13:49.063 --> 02:13:50.314 line:82%
What would you do?

1535
02:13:50.398 --> 02:13:52.024 line:82%
Forget about me.

1536
02:13:52.108 --> 02:13:56.028 line:82%
l command you to sacrifice love.

1537
02:13:57.321 --> 02:14:00.658 line:82%
Save your friendship.

1538
02:14:00.742 --> 02:14:03.244 line:82%
Tina, sometimes you're so silly.

1539
02:14:03.327 --> 02:14:06.372 line:82%
Sacrifice, friendship, love,
what nonsense.

1540
02:14:06.456 --> 02:14:09.584 line:82%
-Pooja, listen to me.
-No, I don't want to.

1541
02:14:11.919 --> 02:14:13.755 line:82%
That's exactly what I did, Tina.

1542
02:14:14.922 --> 02:14:18.968 line:82%
For the sake of friendship,
l sacrificed love.

1543
02:14:25.725 --> 02:14:26.851 line:82%
Raj.

1544
02:14:28.478 --> 02:14:30.855 line:82%
I'm marrying Pooja tomorrow.

1545
02:14:33.107 --> 02:14:34.400 line:82%
Scared?

1546
02:14:35.067 --> 02:14:40.239 line:82%
No, but I think Pooja is.

1547
02:14:41.032 --> 02:14:43.159 line:82%
What do you mean?

1548
02:14:43.242 --> 02:14:47.955 line:82%
l don't know why, but I think
Pooja is upset about something.

1549
02:14:48.039 --> 02:14:53.920 line:82%
You're her friend,
do you know what's bothering her?

1550
02:14:56.422 --> 02:15:00.635 line:82%
Raj, I don't want Pooja
to just be my life partner,

1551
02:15:00.718 --> 02:15:02.804 line:82%
l want her to be a part of my heart.

1552
02:15:05.056 --> 02:15:07.058 line:82%
But I think her heart is somewhere else.

1553
02:15:09.644 --> 02:15:13.189 line:82%
Even though she's with me,
she doesn't belong to me.

1554
02:15:15.525 --> 02:15:16.651 line:82%
It's nothing, Rohan.

1555
02:15:18.236 --> 02:15:22.490 line:82%
Every girl gets nervous
before her wedding.

1556
02:15:23.366 --> 02:15:28.329 line:82%
It's a strange restlessness.
Her life is going to change forever.

1557
02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:33.501 line:82%
A man can never really understand.

1558
02:15:35.461 --> 02:15:36.838 line:82%
But you understand.

1559
02:15:40.258 --> 02:15:46.222 line:82%
Pooja and you know each other really well.
You're really good friends, right?

1560
02:15:49.392 --> 02:15:51.352 line:82%
That friendship never became love?

1561
02:15:54.063 --> 02:15:56.524 line:82%
If I'd have been you,
l would've fallen for Pooja.

1562
02:16:00.194 --> 02:16:02.572 line:82%
-Are you telling me or asking me?
-Both.

1563
02:16:06.075 --> 02:16:10.872 line:82%
Rohan, love doesn't just mean
saying I love you to someone.

1564
02:16:13.499 --> 02:16:16.836 line:82%
Love is love even without saying anything.

1565
02:16:19.797 --> 02:16:25.136 line:82%
And love is sacrifice. It means
keeping quiet for each other's sakes.

1566
02:16:28.681 --> 02:16:30.808 line:82%
Loving isn't merely possessing.

1567
02:16:33.811 --> 02:16:38.774 line:82%
Love is also giving up your own happiness
for someone else's happiness.

1568
02:16:48.701 --> 02:16:50.536 line:82%
Love also means Raj and Pooja.

1569
02:17:14.602 --> 02:17:15.770 line:82%
Gobi parathas.

1570
02:17:19.273 --> 02:17:21.442 line:82%
For the first time,
l made them myself.

1571
02:17:22.693 --> 02:17:24.779 line:82%
l don't know if they're any good.

1572
02:17:32.203 --> 02:17:34.747 line:82%
During the past few days,
l have hated you, Pooja.

1573
02:17:36.165 --> 02:17:37.541 line:82%
Really hated you.

1574
02:17:39.543 --> 02:17:41.587 line:82%
l thought you were being stubborn,

1575
02:17:42.964 --> 02:17:45.800 line:82%
that you didn't know
what you were doing.

1576
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:50.471 line:82%
I realize now you did.

1577
02:17:51.722 --> 02:17:55.685 line:82%
I was in the wrong.

1578
02:17:59.313 --> 02:18:05.277 line:82%
I'm proud to have loved you, Pooja,
and I'm happy for the love you gave me.

1579
02:18:07.989 --> 02:18:10.157 line:82%
Even if we couldn't be together,

1580
02:18:11.826 --> 02:18:15.830 line:82%
our love will always be there.

1581
02:18:19.083 --> 02:18:21.836 line:82%
l don't know the true meaning of love,

1582
02:18:22.837 --> 02:18:24.380 line:82%
but I do know...

1583
02:18:27.258 --> 02:18:31.971 line:82%
that whatever happens to us now
is what love really means.

1584
02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:46.944 line:82%
We have to end one chapter
in our lives and begin another.

1585
02:18:50.072 --> 02:18:53.492 line:82%
We started off as friends

1586
02:18:53.701 --> 02:18:57.872 line:82%
and now again we'll have to be
just friends.

1587
02:19:00.041 --> 02:19:01.889 line:82%
This time...

1588
02:19:02.793 --> 02:19:04.128 line:82%
forever.

1589
02:19:06.714 --> 02:19:07.840 line:82%
So, no tears.

1590
02:19:16.474 --> 02:19:17.850 line:82%
Will you be my friend?

1591
02:19:51.258 --> 02:19:54.762 line:82%
He'll dance the whole day away.
We have to get to the temple.

1592
02:19:54.845 --> 02:19:57.681 line:82%
The priest has phoned twice. Let's go.

1593
02:19:57.765 --> 02:20:01.435 line:82%
-Do you have the bracelets?
-What bracelets?

1594
02:20:03.729 --> 02:20:07.858 line:82%
Pooja, I didn't know you owned
bracelets like these.

1595
02:20:08.692 --> 02:20:13.395 line:82%
There are the bracelets.
I've been looking all over for them.

1596
02:20:13.489 --> 02:20:17.326 line:82%
Raj is always up to his antics.
He always had his eye on these.

1597
02:20:17.827 --> 02:20:21.539 line:82%
He told me that when he found his girl,

1598
02:20:21.622 --> 02:20:24.917 line:82%
he'd get the bracelets re-sized
to fit her wrists

1599
02:20:25.126 --> 02:20:29.588 line:82%
and then he'd present her to me,
so I'd know who my son's bride will be.

1600
02:20:31.173 --> 02:20:35.469 line:82%
Well, Raj kept his word.
Put them on and get ready quickly.

1601
02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:38.806 line:82%
Hurry up.

1602
02:20:42.434 --> 02:20:45.020 line:82%
The bracelets don't fit.

1603
02:20:45.104 --> 02:20:47.690 line:82%
Mr. America is kind of stupid.

1604
02:20:47.773 --> 02:20:49.567 line:82%
He never got it sized for me.

1605
02:20:51.443 --> 02:20:54.155 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-They fit you so well.

1606
02:20:54.238 --> 02:20:55.865 line:82%
Stop it, Tina.

1607
02:21:32.818 --> 02:21:37.528 line:82%
Pooja wants to decorate the platter
for Tina and Raj's wedding ceremony.

1608
02:21:37.615 --> 02:21:40.910 line:82%
Of course, why not?
But where is the other bride?

1609
02:21:40.993 --> 02:21:44.288 line:82%
The other bride takes a little
longer getting dressed.

1610
02:21:44.371 --> 02:21:47.833 line:82%
-Mr. Sahani is escorting her.
-Tell them to hurry up.

1611
02:21:47.917 --> 02:21:48.959 line:82%
Take this.

1612
02:21:58.844 --> 02:22:00.346 line:82%
What are we doing, Raj?

1613
02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:04.016 line:82%
We're fulfilling the wish of someone

1614
02:22:07.061 --> 02:22:08.520 line:82%
we both love.

1615
02:22:10.773 --> 02:22:12.566 line:82%
Are we doing the right thing?

1616
02:22:14.610 --> 02:22:16.612 line:82%
What's right and wrong...

1617
02:22:19.073 --> 02:22:20.824 line:82%
is now up to them.

1618
02:23:45.951 --> 02:23:50.581 line:82%
Do you remember when I asked you
to choose between love and friendship?

1619
02:23:51.623 --> 02:23:54.251 line:82%
l didn't know I was
such a good friend of yours

1620
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:58.422 line:82%
that you would sacrifice your love
for the sake of my friendship.

1621
02:23:59.923 --> 02:24:04.386 line:82%
How could I not notice that Pooja
was there in your every heartbeat?

1622
02:24:05.679 --> 02:24:11.143 line:82%
How could I not see
that you love Pooja, not me.

1623
02:24:12.686 --> 02:24:14.980 line:82%
Your friendship has triumphed
over my love.

1624
02:24:16.523 --> 02:24:19.318 line:82%
Sometimes even true love eludes us.

1625
02:24:20.611 --> 02:24:22.863 line:82%
Radha too.

1626
02:24:23.947 --> 02:24:27.034 line:82%
She loved Krishna,
but he was Rukmani's husband.

1627
02:24:27.659 --> 02:24:31.121 line:82%
Even today, it's Radha and Krishna
who have brought you together.

1628
02:24:31.622 --> 02:24:37.002 line:82%
What could be a greater truth than this?
Who could have a greater love than this?

1629
02:24:38.379 --> 02:24:40.506 line:82%
Why did you think I would be alone?

1630
02:24:41.632 --> 02:24:45.010 line:82%
You don't know how important
your friendship is to my life.

1631
02:24:45.594 --> 02:24:49.681 line:82%
Everything I have comes in twos,
two good friends,

1632
02:24:50.182 --> 02:24:55.270 line:82%
two mothers, the love of two fathers.
And Radha and Krishna are always with me.

1633
02:24:56.772 --> 02:25:02.528 line:82%
When there are so many people around me,
how can I be alone?

1634
02:25:09.535 --> 02:25:12.663 line:82%
I'm not alone, Pooja. I'm not alone.

1635
02:25:18.836 --> 02:25:19.878 line:82%
Raj...

1636
02:25:21.547 --> 02:25:22.923 line:82%
You talk too much.

1637
02:25:24.633 --> 02:25:26.301 line:82%
Can I say something?

1638
02:25:30.722 --> 02:25:32.391 line:82%
Will you be my friend?

1639
02:25:36.437 --> 02:25:39.606 line:82%
I'll see. I'll think about it.

1640
02:25:40.983 --> 02:25:42.818 line:82%
I'll let you know in a day or two.

1641
02:25:59.334 --> 02:26:00.544 line:82%
Rohan?

1642
02:26:05.632 --> 02:26:11.096 line:82%
l haven't lost the one I love,
I've made three new friends.

1643
02:26:12.890 --> 02:26:15.851 line:82%
Your friends are right,
they say you're a great friend.

1644
02:26:17.728 --> 02:26:18.937 line:82%
Which I am.

1645
02:26:19.646 --> 02:26:24.151 line:82%
I don’t know since when
You reside in my heart

1646
02:26:24.234 --> 02:26:28.155 line:82%
I think that you are there
Inside me since I exist

1647
02:26:28.697 --> 02:26:33.243 line:82%
I swear this in the name of God

1648
02:26:33.619 --> 02:26:37.623 line:82%
That you are more important to me
Than everything

1649
02:26:37.715 --> 02:26:42.627 line:82%
I don’t know since when
You reside in my heart

1650
02:26:42.711 --> 02:26:46.590 line:82%
I think that you are there
Inside me since I exist

1651
02:26:46.882 --> 02:26:51.094 line:82%
I swear this in the name of God

1652
02:26:51.386 --> 02:26:55.849 line:82%
That you are more important to me
Than everything

1653
02:26:55.933 --> 02:27:00.687 line:82%
Yes, you are more important to me
Than everything

1654
02:27:39.810 --> 02:27:44.231 line:82%
Even if the travelers walk on it or not

1655
02:27:44.314 --> 02:27:48.902 line:82%
These roads keep on moving

1656
02:27:48.986 --> 02:27:53.479 line:82%
Let’s go, why have you stopped

1657
02:27:53.574 --> 02:27:57.953 line:82%
In the middle of our journey

1658
02:27:58.036 --> 02:28:02.541 line:82%
I’m standing here only

1659
02:28:02.624 --> 02:28:07.004 line:82%
Since I’ve met you

1660
02:28:07.087 --> 02:28:11.967 line:82%
I don’t know since when
You reside in my heart

1661
02:28:12.050 --> 02:28:16.346 line:82%
I think that you are there
Inside me since I exist

1662
02:28:16.597 --> 02:28:20.851 line:82%
I swear this in the name of God

1663
02:28:20.934 --> 02:28:25.147 line:82%
That you are more important to me
Than everything

1664
02:28:25.230 --> 02:28:29.776 line:82%
Yes, you are more important to me
Than everything
