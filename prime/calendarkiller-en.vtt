KNOWING THE DATE OF YOUR DEATH

Hello, this is Anna on Prenzlauer Allee,

8
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.040 line:80%
And I think somebody died.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.440 line:80%

Hi, this is Caro.

31
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.520 line:80%
Hello, Caro.

32
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.440 line:80%
I'm at the bus stop at Mexikoplatz and...

33
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.960 line:80%
There are some guys across the street.

34
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.720 line:80%
They keep staring.
I'm scared they're going to come over.

35
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.000 line:80%
Are you waiting for the bus?

36
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.320 line:80%
Yeah, for the 109.
It should be here by now.

37
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.120 line:80%
Okay, Caro.

38
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.120 line:80%
How many guys are there? How old?

39
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.840 line:80%
Five.

40
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.080 line:80%
I have no idea how old they are.

41
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.680 line:80%
Young. They're all wearing hoodies.

42
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.240 line:80%
Okay. Don't show them your fear.

43
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.480 line:80%
Stand under a streetlight,
so you're well-lit.

44
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.720 line:80%
-They're coming over. What do I do?
-Stay calm.

45
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.800 line:80%
-Are there any parked cars there?
-Yes.

46
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.480 line:80%
-Go over there and hit the hood.
-Why?

47
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.680 line:80%
Just do it.

48
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.760 line:80%
-What are you doing?
-Stupid bitch.

49
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.240 line:80%
Okay. They ran off.

50
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.080 line:80%
Well done.

51
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.880 line:80%
-Here comes my bus.
-Very good.

52
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.560 line:80%
Stay on the line
until you're on the bus, okay?

53
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.720 line:80%
Okay.

54
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.800 line:80%
Are you safe?

55
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.400 line:80%
Yes.

56
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.560 line:80%
Thank you.

57
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.800 line:80%
Well, have a nice evening.

58
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.520 line:80%
Have a nice evening.

59
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.040 line:80%
In the darkest depths of the oceans
where the game of predator and prey...

60
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.320 line:80%
I think nowadays
you cannot believe anyone anymore.

61
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.080 line:80%
Then say it. What do you think?

62
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.280 line:80%
The date of the victim's death was written
on the wall in blood each time.

63
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.640 line:80%
This is the modus operandi to which
the murderer now owes his name,

64
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.960 line:80%
Calendar Killer.

65
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.440 line:80%
So far, this handwriting
is the only lead to the murderer.

66
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.800 line:80%
Pay attention to the particular squiggle
at the end of the number "2."

67
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.920 line:80%
Do you recognize this handwriting?

68
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000 line:80%
Have you ever seen it--

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.520 line:80%
This is the Walk Me Home Helpline.
You just called us.

73
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.520 line:80%
How can I help you?

74
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.920 line:80%
As you're not answering, I'll ask...
Are you being harassed or threatened?

75
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.160 line:80%
Cough if you're being threatened.

76
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.160 line:80%
-Hello?
-Who's there?

77
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.240 line:80%
-The Walk Me Home Helpline.
-Why did you call me?

78
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.600 line:80%
That's not possible.
I don't know who you are.

79
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.800 line:80%
-I don't have your number until now.
-Then it was probably my phone.

80
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.160 line:80%
Would you rather speak
to a female colleague?

81
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.840 line:80%
I can connect you right away.

82
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.000 line:80%
No. There's no need.

83
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.000 line:80%
Don't hang up, please.

84
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.200 line:80%
I can hear that you're in trouble.

85
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.560 line:80%
-Are you injured?
-It's too late.

86
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.680 line:80%
What happened? How can I help you?

87
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.880 line:80%
It's too late.

88
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.040 line:80%
Too late? Why?

89
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.360 line:80%
I'm going to be killed tonight.

90
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.360 line:80%
Killed?

91
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.600 line:80%
-Why do you think that?
-He announced it.

92
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.400 line:80%
May I ask your name?

93
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.000 line:80%
My name is Jules. Jules Tannberg.

94
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040 line:80%
Klara...

95
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.520 line:80%
Klara Vernet.

96
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.200 line:80%
All right, Klara.

97
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.920 line:80%
Who wants to kill you?

98
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.240 line:80%
I'm very tired.

99
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.760 line:80%
Nobody will believe me anyway.

100
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.760 line:80%
Yes, I believe you.

101
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.800 line:80%
Talking to you is pointless. I'm sorry.

102
00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.800 line:80%
It's too late.

103
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.120 line:80%
It's too late.

104
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.480 line:80%
Do you know who wants to kill you?

105
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.480 line:80%
Yes.

106
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.880 line:80%
Who?

107
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.400 line:80%
The Calendar Killer.

108
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.080 line:80%
You don't believe me, do you?

109
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.640 line:80%
I do.

110
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.960 line:80%
Of course, I do.

111
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.080 line:80%
What makes you think it's him?

112
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.840 line:80%
He wrote it on the wall...

113
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.200 line:80%
with a photo of me and my husband.

114
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.680 line:80%
Underneath, it said...

115
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.720 line:80%
12-06. One of you will die. Him or you.

I don't see any other option than...

121
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.360 line:80%
Klara, if you're being threatened,
you have to tell the police.

122
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.720 line:80%
I already did. But they didn't believe me.

123
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.360 line:80%
...that I woke up in a basement
with a death threat on the wall...

124
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.720 line:80%
I couldn't prove anything.

125
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.120 line:80%
When was that?

126
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.280 line:80%
A few weeks ago.

127
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.680 line:80%
I can't remember properly.

128
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.440 line:80%
I woke up in a park

129
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.040 line:80%
and went straight home.

130
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.080 line:80%
-Are you at home now?
-No.

131
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.200 line:80%
Why not?

132
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.040 line:80%
Are you scared that the killer is there?

133
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.400 line:80%
What about your husband?

134
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.840 line:80%
-He won't help me.
-Why not?

135
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.440 line:80%
Because he thinks I imagined it all.

136
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.520 line:80%
That's also what he told the police.

137
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.320 line:80%
He was so embarrassed
and I was very ashamed.

138
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.480 line:80%
But no one makes up something like that.
Isn't your husband worried?

139
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.840 line:80%
He's being threatened, too.

140
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.440 line:80%
He just laughed at me.

141
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.680 line:80%
It's nothing to laugh about.

142
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.280 line:80%
NO STREET NOISE
QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD

143
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.600 line:80%
Where are you now, Klara?

144
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.200 line:80%
I shouldn't have told you any of this.
I'm sorry. I...

145
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.280 line:80%
But at least I've made it this far.

146
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.320 line:80%
What do you mean "this far"?

147
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.760 line:80%
Are you in a garage?

148
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.240 line:80%
Are you driving away?

149
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680 line:80%
Klara?

150
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.240 line:80%
What are you going to do?

151
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.080 line:80%
What are you up to?

152
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.760 line:80%
Please wait a moment.

153
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.880 line:80%
Stay on the line for a moment.

154
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.400 line:80%
Klara...

155
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.800 line:80%
-Don't do anything hasty, please.
-I'm not. Why do you think that?

156
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.000 line:80%
I worked at the Berlin Fire Department's
call center for many years.

157
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.960 line:80%
I know how it sounds
when someone is in major distress.

158
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.400 line:80%
You've called us three times already...

159
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.840 line:80%
but not because of the Calendar Killer.

160
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.520 line:80%
-Why did you call then?
-I was scared to walk home in the dark.

161
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.720 line:80%
Isn't that what this service is for?

162
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800 line:80%
Yes, of course.

163
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.160 line:80%
Forgive me.

164
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.560 line:80%
VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
CREDIBLE?

165
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.200 line:80%
May I ask you a question?

166
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.760 line:80%
What?

167
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.200 line:80%
Is everything okay at home?

168
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.480 line:80%
Yes, absolutely.

169
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.840 line:80%
Where's your husband now?

170
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.360 line:80%
-Why are you walking alone at night?
-Why are you asking all these questions?

171
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.960 line:80%
Because in our notes, it says
there's a suspicion of domestic violence.

172
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.160 line:80%
-These conversations are recorded?
-Yes, why?

173
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.720 line:80%
So everything I tell you is documented?

174
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.160 line:80%
Yes, but only for 48 hours.
And it's covered by data protection.

175
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.640 line:80%
-Why?
-So...

176
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.600 line:80%
So if something were
to happen to me tonight,

177
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.200 line:80%
then the police would find out
about this conversation?

178
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.400 line:80%
What are you getting at?

179
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.920 line:80%
A killer is after you.

180
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.360 line:80%
And you won't go to the police
or home to your husband. Why?

181
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.800 line:80%
27 RENATA STREET

182
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.400 line:80%
You don't believe me either.

183
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.760 line:80%
Are you being abused?

184
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.200 line:80%
Yes.

185
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.200 line:80%
I am sorry.

186
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.680 line:80%
You're afraid.

187
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.040 line:80%
It's even worse than that.

188
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.640 line:80%
It's the kind of fear...

189
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.440 line:80%
that makes you want to tear your skin off,

190
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.600 line:80%
so that you'll stop
from burning up inside.

191
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.240 line:80%
Hell's most evil trick is
to disguise itself as paradise.

192
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.000 line:80%
Good evening.

193
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.880 line:80%
Thank you.

194
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.280 line:80%
Good evening, Mr. Gerrich.

195
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.200 line:80%
Oh, the von Bülows.

196
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.360 line:80%
They made a big donation
to the election campaign. Nice people.

197
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.800 line:80%
Thank you for dressing
the way I've asked you to, Klara.

198
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.400 line:80%
You look fantastic.

199
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.240 line:80%
My pleasure.

200
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.720 line:80%
Klara.

201
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.000 line:80%
My goodness.

202
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.440 line:80%
How are you? We never see you anymore.

203
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.000 line:80%
Wow.

204
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.760 line:80%
-Martin, congratulations on the new job.
-Thank you.

205
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.480 line:80%
-How's the air up there?
-Quite thin.

206
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.160 line:80%
But it can blow right in your face
if you're not careful.

207
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.880 line:80%
-You look fantastic, Meret.
-Thank you.

208
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.480 line:80%
May I introduce you?
Dr. Paul Wassmann, our new associate.

209
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.320 line:80%
-Nice to meet you.
-This is Dr. Martin Vernet.

210
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.560 line:80%
Our State Secretary of the Interior
for three weeks now.

211
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.720 line:80%
And this is my traitorous friend, Klara,
one of the best lawyers at our firm,

212
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.440 line:80%
until she discovered life
as a full-time mom.

213
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.240 line:80%
-Don't you miss work just a little?
-I do sometimes.

214
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.720 line:80%
I really hope you'll come back to us.

215
00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.080 line:80%
-Maybe when Amelie starts school--
-If Klara prefers to raise our daughter,

216
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.840 line:80%
then she should do it.

217
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.080 line:80%
I miss her.

218
00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.840 line:80%
Let's go for coffee, at least.
And you can bring Amelie.

219
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.480 line:80%
I promise.

220
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.840 line:80%
-Martin.
-Enjoy your evening.

221
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.400 line:80%
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

222
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.680 line:80%
Dear Lord, doesn't she ever stop?

223
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.000 line:80%
Be glad you don't have
to deal with her anymore.

224
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.040 line:80%
Actually, it's a shame
I don't see her anymore.

225
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.200 line:80%
But you have me and Amelie.

226
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.480 line:80%
That's true.

227
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.200 line:80%
So... let's celebrate our anniversary.

228
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.080 line:80%
-Evening.
-Thank you.

229
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.240 line:80%
Thank you.

230
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.920 line:80%
So here's to an exciting night.

231
00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.960 line:80%
Enjoy your meal.

232
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.160 line:80%
I know you don't like seafood,

233
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.560 line:80%
but you need protein
for what's planned later.

234
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.680 line:80%
What do we have planned tonight?

235
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240 line:80%
I am sorry.

236
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.840 line:80%
So sorry.

237
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.160 line:80%
Have you stopped taking your pills?

238
00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.520 line:80%
Damn it, Klara.

239
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.000 line:80%
Do I need to have you admitted
to the clinic again?

240
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.000 line:80%
-Martin, I'm fine.
-I'm warning you.

241
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.120 line:80%
I won't let Amelie have
a mentally deranged mother.

242
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.520 line:80%
-I can't stomach the pills.
-The doctor can prescribe something else.

243
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.160 line:80%
-Forgive me.
-So...

244
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.560 line:80%
Time to eat.

245
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.280 line:80%
How long is the babysitter staying?

246
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.920 line:80%
Vigo will stay until we get home.

247
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.240 line:80%
Give me your phone.

248
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.760 line:80%
Welcome to our VP Night.

249
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.600 line:80%
I'm here for you,
whatever you might desire.

250
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.240 line:80%
What's a VP Night?

251
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.960 line:80%
Very exclusive.

252
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.520 line:80%
Martin, please. I'd like to go.

253
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.840 line:80%
You haven't even finished your drink.

254
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.320 line:80%
What's the matter? These women are
being paid very well for their services.

255
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.760 line:80%
The entrance fee is donated
to the Children's Foundation.

256
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.920 line:80%
It's a good thing.

257
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.200 line:80%
Martin, please.

258
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.280 line:80%
It's for a good cause.

259
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.760 line:80%
He must have put something
in the champagne.

260
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.800 line:80%
That's horrible.

261
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.960 line:80%
I only regained consciousness
because of the pain.

262
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.600 line:80%
Martin, please...

263
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.680 line:80%
Klara, you must leave your husband.

264
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.080 line:80%
Yes.

265
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.080 line:80%
I should have done it
a long time ago. It's just...

266
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.320 line:80%
I don't want Amelie to find out
what he's done to me.

267
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.680 line:80%
That's understandable.
You didn't want to hurt her...

268
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.680 line:80%
-How old is your daughter?
-Amelie is six.

269
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.240 line:80%
I have a daughter, too.
Her name is Fabienne.

270
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.880 line:80%
She's six, too.

271
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.200 line:80%
-Where is your daughter now?
-She's asleep.

272
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.560 line:80%
And who's looking after her? Is she alone?

273
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.040 line:80%
Of course not.

274
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.320 line:80%
We've got a babysitter.

275
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.040 line:80%
Can you believe that he's a good father?

276
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.000 line:80%
It's hard to believe, but it's true.

277
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.720 line:80%
Amelie loves him.

278
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.320 line:80%
I have to go, now, before he finds me.

279
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.360 line:80%
Where are you?

280
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.960 line:80%
You are closing a garage door.

281
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.080 line:80%
You opened a car door.
What are you planning?

282
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.520 line:80%
For what I'm planning to do,
it's better if I'm alone.

283
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.480 line:80%
No.

284
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.200 line:80%
No, don't do that.

285
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.440 line:80%
Please don't do it.

286
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.880 line:80%
Don't tell me what to do.

287
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.520 line:80%
I'm sorry.

288
00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.480 line:80%
I'm so sorry, but you cannot do this.

289
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.360 line:80%
Don't do this! Don't do this, please!

290
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.040 line:80%
I am begging you.

291
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.360 line:80%
Klara! Klara, please!

292
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.640 line:80%
MARTIN - I always know where you are!
Brace yourself!

293
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.920 line:80%
Either the Calendar Killer
or Martin will kill me.

294
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.560 line:80%
So I'd rather do it myself.

295
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.000 line:80%
If you do this...

296
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.720 line:80%
Amelie will never get over it.

297
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.640 line:80%
Believe me.

298
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.840 line:80%
I can hear that you're not driving.

299
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.320 line:80%
I am begging you. Please stop.
We'll find a way.

300
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.240 line:80%
Klara?

301
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.760 line:80%
Hello? Klara, please.

302
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.360 line:80%
Enough!

303
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.200 line:80%
I don't want to have
to take her to the ER.

304
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.360 line:80%
I don't want to have
to take her to the ER.

305
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.240 line:80%
You did well, darling.

306
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.720 line:80%
Let's take a little break, okay?

307
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.640 line:80%
Please take care of my wife.

308
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.480 line:80%
Come. I'll show you to our powder room.

309
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.080 line:80%
I'll go get you a stronger painkiller.

310
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.320 line:80%
Did your wife enjoy it?

311
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.800 line:80%
You never forget the first time.

312
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.040 line:80%
Excuse me, please.

313
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.440 line:80%
-Where's my wife?
-She must still be in the powder room.

314
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.640 line:80%
Yo, this is Vigo. Feel free to leave
a message after the beep.

315
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.720 line:80%
Hi, Vigo.

316
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.640 line:80%
This message is for Amelie.

317
00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.800 line:80%
Hi, sweetie.

318
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.320 line:80%
Mommy!

319
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.560 line:80%
I just wanted to tell you
how much I love you.

320
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.120 line:80%
It wasn't your fault, you hear me?

321
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.400 line:80%
I love you so much.

322
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.000 line:80%
CALLING

323
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.320 line:80%
DAD
INCOMING CALL

324
00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.560 line:80%
I have no time right now. Call tomorrow.

325
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.000 line:80%
How come? What's wrong?

326
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.560 line:80%
-An emergency.
-An emergency?

327
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.400 line:80%
I thought you were still on leave?

328
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.920 line:80%
-I'm not at the emergency switchboard.
-So where are you?

329
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.640 line:80%
Walk Me Home Helpline. Voluntary.

330
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.880 line:80%
There's a woman who wants to kill herself.

331
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.120 line:80%
Then call the police.

332
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.560 line:80%
I don't know where she is.

333
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.920 line:80%
-Maybe I can help you?
-That would be a first.

334
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.600 line:80%
Tell me her name,
and I'll find out where she is.

335
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.080 line:80%
No, I'm not allowed to.

336
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.040 line:80%
Jules, you're talking to a woman
who wants to kill herself.

337
00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.960 line:80%
I can imagine what that's doing to you.

338
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.480 line:80%
-You can?
-Yes. I can.

339
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.640 line:80%
You want to save her,

340
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.400 line:80%
-after the incident with Dajana--
-Stop it!

341
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.680 line:80%
-Where are you?
-At home. Where else?

342
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.560 line:80%
What?

343
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.240 line:80%
Jules, I want to help you. Damn it.
I'm your father.

344
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.760 line:80%
-Congrats on that realization.
-Tell me what you know.

345
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.360 line:80%
So, what's her name?

346
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.600 line:80%
All right. It's up to you.

347
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.040 line:80%
-If it all goes wrong and you haven't--
-Her name is Klara.

348
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.360 line:80%
-Klara... Klara what?
-Vernet.

349
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.360 line:80%
That's it?

350
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.440 line:80%
She was at the Le Zen Hotel today.

351
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.960 line:80%
There must be
some secret pervert club there.

352
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.880 line:80%
That's news to me.

353
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.280 line:80%
But I'll ask around.
I still know someone there.

354
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.040 line:80%
Stay out of everything else, okay?

355
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.960 line:80%
Further snow showers
are expected in Berlin tonight.

356
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.480 line:80%
So please drive carefully,
or make yourself comfortable at home.

357
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.520 line:80%
It's 10:03 p.m.
The next news will be at 11:00 p.m.

358
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.680 line:80%
Thank God. How are you feeling?

359
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.800 line:80%
Shitty.

360
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.040 line:80%
I feel sick. I threw up.

361
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.400 line:80%
I can't go on. I am so tired.

362
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.960 line:80%
Where are you now?

363
00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.240 line:80%
Where the Calendar Killer
will never find me...

364
00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.520 line:80%
Why is this so important to you?

365
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.800 line:80%
Why can't you just leave me alone?

366
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.280 line:80%
I'm sure you can't imagine it, but...

367
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.080 line:80%
I know exactly what you're going through.

368
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.880 line:80%
I've been on the phone
with women like you for a long time.

369
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.120 line:80%
Women who were crying because their men
had beaten them half to death.

370
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.880 line:80%
And were you able to help them?

371
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.720 line:80%
I tried.

372
00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.200 line:80%
Over and over again.

373
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.040 line:80%
But as soon as the police arrived,

374
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.240 line:80%
suddenly everything was only half as bad,
and the men got away with it.

375
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.720 line:80%
I don't understand it.

376
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.680 line:80%
Why do women put up with it?

377
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.640 line:80%
Because they're financially dependent.

378
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.000 line:80%
Or they don't want
to take the kids from their dad.

379
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.120 line:80%
Because they're ashamed.

380
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.200 line:80%
Because they don't know where to go.

381
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.480 line:80%
Or they think
they're to blame for the beatings.

382
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.280 line:80%
Because they're terrified it'll only
get worse, and they'll be killed.

383
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.080 line:80%
Or the husband has some hold
over the woman and is blackmailing her.

384
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.440 line:80%
Klara, put an end to this misery,
but don't end your life.

385
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.160 line:80%
Why is it so important to you?
You don't know me at all.

386
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.240 line:80%
I told you about my daughter. Fabienne?

387
00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.520 line:80%
Yes.

388
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.080 line:80%
Her mother killed herself.

389
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.680 line:80%
Ever since that,
Fabienne hasn't been doing--

390
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.280 line:80%
Why are you telling me all this?

391
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.680 line:80%
To make me feel guilty?

392
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.440 line:80%
No.

393
00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.440 line:80%
Her mother was in a clinic.

394
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.680 line:80%
At first, it seemed things would be okay.

395
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.160 line:80%
The doctors at Berger Hof...

396
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.520 line:80%
-That was the clinic she was in.
-Berger Hof?

397
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.640 line:80%
-I was there, too.
-What? What for?

398
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.840 line:80%
Dissociative disorders.

399
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.920 line:80%
Sometimes, I see things that aren't there.

400
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000 line:80%
-Were they able to help you?
-Yes, they did.

401
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.200 line:80%
But I have to take medication.

402
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.240 line:80%
And Martin threatens to have me
admitted again for every little thing.

403
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.360 line:80%
Dajana suffered from severe depression.

404
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.920 line:80%
I had hoped that they would
be able to help her, but...

405
00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.480 line:80%
It was too late.

406
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.560 line:80%
You're not the only one
who's been through hell.

407
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.360 line:80%
Mommy! Please open the door!

408
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.640 line:80%
Mommy! It's on fire!

409
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.840 line:80%
Mommy!

410
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.560 line:80%
Mommy!

411
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.280 line:80%
Mommy!

412
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.520 line:80%
We can't get out!

413
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.000 line:80%
Hurry, there's a fire,
and I hear someone screaming.

414
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.160 line:80%
It's a child.

415
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.520 line:80%
The firefighters will be there
in under two minutes.

416
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.160 line:80%
Do not open the door!

417
00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.720 line:80%
It could cause a back draft,
and you'll be in flames.

418
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.880 line:80%
-Please leave the building.
-But what about the kid? The screams...

419
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.600 line:80%
My colleagues will take care of it.
Please get out of there.

420
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.720 line:80%
Just a moment.

421
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.520 line:80%
-Yes?
-Incident command vehicle 26. Stelling.

422
00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.680 line:80%
Tannberg, what's going on?
There's nothing here.

423
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.440 line:80%
-What do you mean?
-There's no fire anywhere here.

424
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.360 line:80%
Okay.

425
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.080 line:80%
-Mr. Damelow?
-Yes? Where are you?

426
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.000 line:80%
There's no fire
in Brandenburgische Street.

427
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:06.960 line:80%
What?

428
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.680 line:80%
-That prank will be expensive.
-Oh, God.

429
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.120 line:80%
I was in a panic,
and I gave you the wrong address.

430
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.600 line:80%
-Where are you?
-I am so sorry.

431
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.240 line:80%
I'm at 24 Prince Regent Street.
Third floor.

432
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.400 line:80%
-Please repeat that.
-24 Prince Regent Street. Hello?

433
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.600 line:80%
Let me through! Damn it!

434
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.640 line:80%
What happened?

435
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.680 line:80%
Dajana locked up the kids in their rooms.

436
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.640 line:80%
She wanted to spare them the sight
of their dead mother in the bathtub.

437
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.920 line:80%
My little ones
tried desperately to get out.

438
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.120 line:80%
Fabienne managed to hide in the closet.

439
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.480 line:80%
She was taken to the hospital.

440
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.120 line:80%
My son was probably playing
with a leftover birthday candle.

441
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.400 line:80%
She must have noticed the smoke.

442
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.400 line:80%
But it was too late.

443
00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.880 line:80%
She wanted to unlock the door.

444
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.880 line:80%
But she had no strength left.

445
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.840 line:80%
I am sorry.

446
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.520 line:80%
Look at me.

447
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.800 line:80%
Just a moment. I need to check something.

448
00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.000 line:80%
Stay on the line.

449
00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.720 line:80%
Turn around!

450
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.520 line:80%
Come over here.

451
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.480 line:80%
Show your face.

452
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.280 line:80%
Klara!

453
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.640 line:80%
12-06
HIM OR YOU

454
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.880 line:80%
Look at me. Look at me.

455
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.920 line:80%
Now... turn around.

456
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.040 line:80%
Show me your face.

457
00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.400 line:80%
Klara! Look at me!

458
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.320 line:80%
Look at me! Look at me!

459
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.960 line:80%
Turn around.

460
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.520 line:80%
Now show me your face.

461
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.600 line:80%
Klara!

462
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.120 line:80%
Look at me!

463
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.000 line:80%
Mommy?

464
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.520 line:80%
Klara, I'm back.

465
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.560 line:80%
Jules... he was here.

466
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.440 line:80%
-He was here.
-Who?

467
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.240 line:80%
The Calendar Killer.
He was here in the cabin.

468
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.680 line:80%
Listen. This is what we'll do.

469
00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.480 line:80%
I'll send a cab to take you straight home.

470
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.680 line:80%
Give me the address.

471
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.280 line:80%
I'd rather take my car.

472
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.640 line:80%
No, wait.

473
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.520 line:80%
I'll send you something.

474
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.640 line:80%
12-06
HIM OR YOU

475
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.960 line:80%
Now they'll have to believe me.

476
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.720 line:80%
The police and Martin.

477
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.440 line:80%
He said it was
just another one of my delusions.

478
00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.400 line:80%
He asked how anyone would know
when I was in the parking garage.

479
00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.960 line:80%
Martin wanted to have me
readmitted to Berger Hof.

480
00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.080 line:80%
He has left you completely alone
with your fear.

481
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.440 line:80%
The more I think about it...

482
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.560 line:80%
the more I believe...

483
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.080 line:80%
I believe that Martin's behind it all.

484
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.760 line:80%
Why?

485
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.960 line:80%
He's the only one
who always knows where I am.

486
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.320 line:80%
He knows the cabin.

487
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.800 line:80%
He's got the videos.

488
00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.080 line:80%
He's using my illness against me.

489
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.120 line:80%
And on December 6...

490
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.560 line:80%
We got married on December 6.

491
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.560 line:80%
Please drive home right away
and get your child.

492
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.200 line:80%
We'll meet in front of your apartment.

493
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.800 line:80%
I'll help you.

494
00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.560 line:80%
You don't know him.

495
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.080 line:80%
He always wins.

496
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:05.920 line:80%
Not this time.

497
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:13.960 line:80%
Jules.

498
00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.880 line:80%
He's here.

499
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.800 line:80%
Klara, is someone there?

500
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.760 line:80%
Klara, tell me what's happening?

501
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.080 line:80%
Klara, is there someone in your house?

502
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.880 line:80%
Can you hear me? Is someone there?

503
00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.040 line:80%
Can you hear me? Klara, please...

504
00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.360 line:80%
DECEMBER 6

505
00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.200 line:80%
-What?
-Is the woman still on the line?

506
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.280 line:80%
Where are you?

507
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.640 line:80%
I'm standing here in front of Le Zen.

508
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.880 line:80%
And you?

509
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.080 line:80%
-Did you find out anything?
-The manager was beside himself.

510
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.080 line:80%
Obviously, he's going to deny it.

511
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.120 line:80%
He would have told me. Trust me.

512
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.000 line:80%
-Did you really look everywhere?
-Yes, there's nothing there.

513
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.240 line:80%
Jules, do you hear me?
The woman lied to you.

514
00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.840 line:80%
Why should I believe you more than her?

515
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.480 line:80%
-Given all the times you lied to Mom--
-The woman is lying.

516
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:10.200 line:80%
And I swear to you.
Her suicide story doesn't add up.

Please. I'm begging you.

Hey!

522
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.600 line:80%
Calm down. Just calm down.

523
00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.600 line:80%
Hey, calm down.

Hey, calm down!

Come. It's alright.

Klara!

532
00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.440 line:80%
It's Hendrik, right?

533
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.000 line:80%
Just let me out somewhere
when we get to the city.

534
00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.320 line:80%
It looks like you need a doctor.

535
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.160 line:80%
I'll get you to the next ER.

536
00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.520 line:80%
It's nice that you're concerned.
But I'm fine.

537
00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.000 line:80%
Just let me out anywhere in the city.

539
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.520 line:80%
How come you're driving around
at night in a Santa costume?

540
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.480 line:80%
Bachelor's party.

541
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.320 line:80%
I'm a stripper.

542
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.200 line:80%
You should see my underpants.

543
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.840 line:80%
Red with a white pom-pom
in front of the family jewels.

544
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.440 line:80%

Klara! Are you all right? What happened?

548
00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.280 line:80%
I saw him.

549
00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.840 line:80%
The Calendar Killer was in our cabin.

550
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.720 line:80%
But I made it out.

551
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:13.000 line:80%
-Where are you now?
-On my way to the city. I got a ride.

552
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.000 line:80%
-Who with?
-Santa Claus.

553
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.560 line:80%
-Excuse me?
-Don't worry about it.

554
00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.240 line:80%
Listen. Martin must be on his way home.
I have to get to Amelie before him.

555
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.840 line:80%
Please be careful.

556
00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.600 line:80%
You shouldn't trust anyone tonight.

557
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.440 line:80%
Daddy!

558
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.840 line:80%
Please stay on the line.
I need to check on my daughter.

559
00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.520 line:80%
Mommy.

560
00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:38.960 line:80%
Daddy.

561
00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.360 line:80%
Is everything okay?

562
00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.160 line:80%
No. No, she is burning up.

563
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.800 line:80%
I need to check if there's
any liquid fever medication left.

564
00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.800 line:80%
Mommy.

565
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.000 line:80%
Mommy.

566
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.640 line:80%
Daddy.

567
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.640 line:80%
Mommy.

568
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.240 line:80%
Can you sing?

569
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.120 line:80%
-What?
-Sing?

570
00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.840 line:80%
Well...

571
00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.560 line:80%
Put the phone next to Fabienne's ear.

572
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:05.160 line:80%
Behold, the moon has risen

573
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000 line:80%
The golden stars, they glisten

574
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:17.080 line:80%
Upon the heavens bright

575
00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.480 line:80%
The forests rest in shadows

576
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:30.160 line:80%
And from the quiet meadows

577
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:36.400 line:80%
White haze rises into the night

578
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.880 line:80%
Dajana used to
always sing that to Fabienne.

579
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.960 line:80%
Is she calmer now?

580
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.880 line:80%
Yes, she is.

581
00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.760 line:80%
Thank you.

582
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.520 line:80%
I can't leave Amelie all alone.

583
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.040 line:80%
I have to be there for her.

584
00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.000 line:80%
I mustn't destroy her life.

585
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.920 line:80%
I've let that happen to me
all these years.

586
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.240 line:80%
I loved Martin.

587
00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:34.240 line:80%
But I can't do it anymore.

588
00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.200 line:80%
I have to go home to my daughter...

589
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.560 line:80%
and finally leave Martin.

590
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.920 line:80%
I'll help you if you want.

591
00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.640 line:80%
I can make sure you and Amelie are safe.

592
00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.760 line:80%
Just tell me where you are and...

593
00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.680 line:80%
-I'll come.
-You've already helped me enough.

594
00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.600 line:80%
I have to do this alone.

595
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.600 line:80%
And with the photo,
I have proof that the Calendar...

596
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.760 line:80%
That I didn't just imagine it all.
Now they have to believe me.

597
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.040 line:80%
Just another hour
and December 6 will be over.

598
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.840 line:80%
My offer still stands.

599
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.360 line:80%
Thank you, Jules.

600
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.880 line:80%
My pleasure, Klara.

601
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.280 line:80%
What was that all about?

602
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.760 line:80%
The Calendar Killer is after you?

603
01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.560 line:80%
Can I get one of those?

604
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.120 line:80%
Sure.

605
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.680 line:80%
Another pack should be
in the box back there.

606
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.080 line:80%
My first one in 15 years.

607
01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.520 line:80%
Do you have a light?

608
01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.680 line:80%
Where is it?

609
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.360 line:80%
-Stop the car. Right now!
-Hey, calm down.

610
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.040 line:80%
I always have the taser with me.

611
01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.920 line:80%
-Calm down!
-Open the door!

612
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.120 line:80%
-Take it easy!
-Open!

613
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.640 line:80%
I won't hurt you.

614
01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.880 line:80%
Okay?

615
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.520 line:80%
Everything is fine. Really.

616
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.000 line:80%
I'm not going to hurt you.

617
01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.400 line:80%
Hey, what...

618
01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.040 line:80%
Martin!

619
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.400 line:80%
Stop it!

620
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.040 line:80%
It wasn't nice of you to take off earlier.

621
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.200 line:80%
Get in!

622
01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.200 line:80%
-We can't just leave him. He'll freeze!
-Get in. Now!

623
01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.240 line:80%
Let go!

624
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.200 line:80%
I'm so sorry.

625
01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.920 line:80%
I'm so sorry.

626
01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.000 line:80%
You must have known I'd find you.

627
01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.840 line:80%
Who was that?

628
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.920 line:80%
I saw footprints in front of the house.

629
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.880 line:80%
Didn't you go into the bedroom?

630
01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.400 line:80%
The bedroom?

631
01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320 line:80%
What's that?

632
01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.160 line:80%
A death threat from the Calendar Killer.

633
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.160 line:80%
The Calendar Killer?

634
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.960 line:80%
Klara, don't start with all that again.

635
01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.160 line:80%
I'll drive back there tomorrow.

636
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.360 line:80%
If it's really written there,
I'll call the police.

637
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.520 line:80%
But if you're just making it up again,
I'll take you back to Berger Hof.

638
01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.720 line:80%
I was in the garage. I saw the tube.

639
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.120 line:80%
Don't ever do that again.

640
01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.000 line:80%
What are you doing?

641
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.240 line:80%
I'm checking if Vigo texted me.

642
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.520 line:80%
I was thinking about us.

643
01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.680 line:80%
Last year, after I took you
to the ER in Potsdam...

644
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.320 line:80%
When we went back home
and I cooked for you,

645
01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.240 line:80%
you asked me for the thousandth time
why I don't get therapy.

646
01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.920 line:80%
The truth is, I started therapy.

647
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.560 line:80%
But the guy just reeled off
the usual spiel.

648
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.680 line:80%
How I lacked confidence

649
01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.560 line:80%
because I had an abusive father
and a mother who ran away.

650
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.160 line:80%
I don't need a therapist for that.

651
01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.080 line:80%
You see?

652
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.840 line:80%
I have no problem saying it.

653
01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.440 line:80%
If there was a self-help group like the AA
where you had to introduce yourself,

654
01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.360 line:80%
I'd do it.

655
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.560 line:80%
I'd stand up and say,

656
01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.800 line:80%
"Hello. My name is Martin.
I'm 44 and I beat my wife."

657
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.840 line:80%
And that's supposed to justify everything?

658
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.280 line:80%
You need to stop provoking me, Klara.

659
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.120 line:80%
Provoking you?

660
01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.640 line:80%
-I'm provoking you?
-Yes.

661
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.280 line:80%
How?

662
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.880 line:80%
Why didn't you leave a long time ago?

663
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.600 line:80%
You just put up with it.
The beatings, the shouting.

664
01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.400 line:80%
You let it all happen, Klara.
Every punch, every kick.

665
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.400 line:80%
Let it happen?

666
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.240 line:80%
I let you...

667
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.400 line:80%
drag me to that perverted club?

668
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.280 line:80%
Let you offer me up...

669
01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.360 line:80%
to be whipped like a piece of meat?

670
01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.640 line:80%
-Are you serious?
-I didn't say that.

671
01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.520 line:80%
But you make me angry so often,
just by being there.

672
01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.520 line:80%
How can I respect you
if you don't even respect yourself?

673
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.160 line:80%
You scare the shit out of me
every day, Martin.

674
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.840 line:80%
I know.

675
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.680 line:80%
And I'm sorry about that.

676
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.400 line:80%
Do you believe me?

677
01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.000 line:80%
Do you believe that I love you?

678
01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.000 line:80%
I'll tell you something.
You won't leave me!

679
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.920 line:80%
Do you understand me?

680
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.040 line:80%
Drive me home.

681
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.000 line:80%
I want to be with my daughter.

682
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.040 line:80%
I can help you.

683
01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280 line:80%
So...

684
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.480 line:80%
brace yourself for what's coming.

685
01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.320 line:80%
You won't touch me in front of Amelie.

686
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.800 line:80%
Don't tell me what to do.

687
01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.680 line:80%
Never touch me again.

688
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.480 line:80%
Klara!

689
01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.760 line:80%
Klara!

690
01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.280 line:80%
Vigo?

691
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.280 line:80%
Vigo?

692
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.880 line:80%
Behold, the moon has risen

693
01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:31.040 line:80%
The golden stars, they glisten

694
01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.320 line:80%
Upon the heavens bright

695
01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.880 line:80%
Amelie?

696
01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.920 line:80%
The forests rest in shadows

697
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.800 line:80%
And from the quiet meadows

698
01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:00.520 line:80%
White haze rises into the night

699
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.240 line:80%
Hello, Klara.

700
01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.440 line:80%
Jules?

701
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.080 line:80%
What's wrong with Amelie?

702
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.680 line:80%
Don't worry. She's fine.

703
01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.280 line:80%
Just a sleeping pill.

704
01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.840 line:80%
Where's Martin?

705
01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.760 line:80%
Where's Vigo?

706
01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.480 line:80%
Let's leave her bedroom.

707
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.480 line:80%
Or she'll wake up.

708
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.000 line:80%
Jules, why are you here?

709
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.000 line:80%
Let her sleep.

710
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.720 line:80%
12-06
HIM OR YOU

711
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.320 line:80%
Please don't.

712
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.080 line:80%
It's time.

713
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.000 line:80%
Where's your husband?

714
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.240 line:80%
Please.

715
01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.360 line:80%
Let me show you something.

716
01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.000 line:80%
I saw everything he did to you.

717
01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.520 line:80%
There are cameras in every room.

718
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.440 line:80%
What I saw is unbearable.

719
01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.440 line:80%
Drop it.

720
01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.400 line:80%
Don't make it so difficult.

721
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.560 line:80%
Ten minutes left.

722
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.440 line:80%
Now it's Klara or Martin.

723
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.400 line:80%
So, where is he?

724
01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.440 line:80%
Jules...

725
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.920 line:80%
It's close to midnight.

726
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.120 line:80%
I told you I'm leaving Martin.
Why does he have to die?

727
01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.320 line:80%
I just want to leave him
and take Amelie with me.

728
01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.560 line:80%
Why do you still stand up for him?

729
01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.480 line:80%
You know he deserves it.

730
01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.960 line:80%
Jules, stop this madness.

731
01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.000 line:80%
The madness is what you let him do to you.

732
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.520 line:80%
Where is your husband?

733
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.960 line:80%
Now it's your chance
to take back control of your life.

734
01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.560 line:80%
It's him or you.

735
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.560 line:80%
Four more minutes.

736
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.280 line:80%
You have to kill him.

737
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.200 line:80%
Stay quiet.

738
01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.560 line:80%
And Fabienne?

739
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.520 line:80%
What happened to Fabienne?

740
01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.720 line:80%
Fabienne is dead. She didn't make it.

741
01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.720 line:80%
She died in the hospital.

742
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.120 line:80%
You have to get
this bastard out of your life.

743
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:06.800 line:80%
And then?

744
01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.600 line:80%
What happens then?
You can't just let me go.

745
01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.760 line:80%
Trust me.

746
01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.720 line:80%
I have a plan.

747
01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.720 line:80%
I'm on your side.

748
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.440 line:80%
It's 11.57 p.m.

749
01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.120 line:80%
You will kill him.

750
01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.120 line:80%
Or I will kill you.

751
01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.720 line:80%
Three minutes.

752
01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.040 line:80%
Take it.

753
01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.440 line:80%
-I can't do it. Please.
-Come on.

754
01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.600 line:80%
Jules, please.

755
01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.440 line:80%
Think of everything he did to you.

756
01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.640 line:80%
This man made your life a living hell!

757
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.640 line:80%
Do you even realize
the chance I'm giving you?

758
01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:51.920 line:80%
Two minutes.

759
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.920 line:80%
Jules, please...

760
01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.920 line:80%
-What?
-Don't you...

761
01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.640 line:80%
Don't you understand?

762
01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.120 line:80%
Martin's death won't bring Dajana back.

763
01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.200 line:80%
Well...

764
01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.520 line:80%
That's true.

765
01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.800 line:80%
You're smart.

766
01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.320 line:80%
So was Dajana.

767
01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.480 line:80%
But what she went through as a child,
her father's abuse,

768
01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.720 line:80%
a mother who kept quiet
and looked the other way...

769
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.800 line:80%
It broke her.

770
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.080 line:80%
And when she took her own life,
she took my children's lives with her.

771
01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.480 line:80%
And she took mine, too.

772
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.240 line:80%
I do what I do to give women like you

773
01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.040 line:80%
the chance to fight back.

774
01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.080 line:80%
One minute.

775
01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.040 line:80%
You can do it.

776
01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.320 line:80%
Think of Amelie.

777
01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.280 line:80%
She needs you.

778
01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.040 line:80%
But not a father like him.

779
01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.200 line:80%
I'm sorry.

780
01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.120 line:80%
Okay, please...

781
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.960 line:80%
Be still.

782
01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.880 line:80%
How? Where?

783
01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.240 line:80%
The carotid artery.

784
01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.840 line:80%
Like this?

785
01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.280 line:80%
Yes.

786
01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.240 line:80%
Forgive me.

787
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.840 line:80%
Klara!

788
01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.360 line:80%
You two deserve each other.

789
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.000 line:80%
He's my son.

790
01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.000 line:80%
I'm sorry.

791
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.320 line:80%
I wanted to protect you from him.

792
01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.520 line:80%
But I was too late.

793
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.280 line:80%
I was too late.

794
01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.560 line:80%
I recognized his handwriting on TV.

795
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:11.360 line:80%
-How did he survive that?
-A nightmare.

796
01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.520 line:80%
It must have been a nightmare.

797
01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.760 line:80%
Yes, you could say that.

798
01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.200 line:80%
My wife and I were incredibly lucky.

799
01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.520 line:80%
It was unimaginable.

800
01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.280 line:80%
And our daughter is still so young.

801
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.720 line:80%
Ladies and gentlemen,

802
01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.080 line:80%
may I ask you to switch off your phones
and take your seats.

803
01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:46.280 line:80%
We will now begin with the award
