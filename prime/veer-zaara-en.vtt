00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.620 line:82%
One morning

2
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.582 line:82%
lifting the veil of darkness

3
00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:45.671 line:82%
when the sun showed itself

4
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:50.759 line:82%
it saw the pleasant weather of love

5
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:57.224 line:82%
and the innumerable memories of the past

6
00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:59.685 line:82%
blooming like flowers.

7
00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.646 line:82%
Unsaid, unheard desires

8
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:06.316 line:82%
partially awake

9
00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.444 line:82%
peep on the sly.

10
00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:14.825 line:82%
Life flows like a river.

11
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:19.079 line:82%
It moves, yet stays still.

12
00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.456 line:82%
Yes, that very life

13
00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:25.294 line:82%
in which resides love

14
00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:28.005 line:82%
as well as desires.

15
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:32.301 line:82%
There's closeness. There are distances.

16
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:37.306 line:82%
There is this feeling
that time is like a waterfall.

17
00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:40.892 line:82%
It moves on with the message

18
00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:44.521 line:82%
that there is love all around.

19
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.815 line:82%
There are innumerable
memories of the past

20
00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:50.861 line:82%
blooming like a flower.

21
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:15.021 line:82%
Why is the breeze humming?

22
00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:39.201 line:82%
Why is the breeze humming?

23
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:44.373 line:82%
Why does the atmosphere feel lively?

24
00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:49.086 line:82%
I wonder what's about to happen today

25
00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:53.882 line:82%
Why does the moon appear
during the day?

26
00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:59.012 line:82%
Where is my life headed?

27
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:03.767 line:82%
What's going on around me?

28
00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:08.438 line:82%
Why is the breeze humming?

29
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:13.652 line:82%
It's humming...

30
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:40.762 line:82%
Whose face

31
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:46.435 line:82%
am I seeing in every flower?

32
00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:55.694 line:82%
Whose face

33
00:03:55.694 --> 00:04:00.490 line:82%
am I seeing in every flower?

34
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.370 line:82%
Whose voice

35
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.000 line:82%
echoes in my ears?

36
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.880 line:82%
Whose footsteps are these?

37
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.093 line:82%
What kind of dreams are these?

38
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:24.723 line:82%
I wonder who's coming

39
00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:29.436 line:82%
Why is the breeze humming?

40
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:34.399 line:82%
It's humming...

41
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:59.067 line:82%
Your dream is going to come true today.

42
00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:02.612 line:82%
Today is your daughter's first case.

43
00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:06.866 line:82%
You spent all your life
fighting for truth and justice.

44
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:11.788 line:82%
I am about to take my
first step in the same field.

45
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:17.836 line:82%
Like always,
I have your faith and blessings.

46
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.953 line:82%
Kareem Khan,
you do know to cook, don't you?

47
00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:55.248 line:82%
No, my wife cooks.

48
00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:58.084 line:82%
Start learning tomorrow.

49
00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:02.339 line:82%
Because now, women have started
taking up the jobs of men.

50
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.550 line:82%
Who knows,
we might starve someday.

51
00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:09.679 line:82%
Can I meet that Indian prisoner now?

52
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.352 line:82%
Absolutely. It's your right, ma'am.

53
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.105 line:82%
Come, let me take you to him.

54
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:24.277 line:82%
I'll get to spend
some more time with you.

55
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.779 line:82%
Shall we?

56
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.073 line:82%
Well, please don't mind.

57
00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:31.451 line:82%
I feel like you're only wasting time.

58
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.663 line:82%
This man has been
here for the past 22 years.

59
00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:38.833 line:82%
No one has heard a single word from him.

60
00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:44.756 line:82%
I think he's happy here.
He never fights or complains.

61
00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:47.676 line:82%
As if he doesn't want to be free at all.

62
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:50.261 line:82%
Freedom is every person's birth right,

63
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.514 line:82%
and it's my duty
to make sure he gets it.

64
00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:56.017 line:82%
You do your duty, and let me do mine.

65
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:04.651 line:82%
Hey, 786! Look who's here to see you.

66
00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:10.365 line:82%
Hey, you idiot!
The lawyer is here. Say hello!

67
00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:17.080 line:82%
There are orders to reopen
the cases of a few Indian prisoners.

68
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.167 line:82%
Find your lost voice,
and say what you have to.

69
00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.379 line:82%
You won't get this opportunity again.

70
00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:33.805 line:82%
-I told you.
-Open the cell.

71
00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.725 line:82%
I want to talk to him in private.

72
00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:40.270 line:82%
You've signed the papers.
What do I care?

73
00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:46.526 line:82%
Kareem Khan! Keep a watch.

74
00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:52.949 line:82%
Here you are.
I've done my duty.

75
00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:57.579 line:82%
Now, the prisoner is your problem.

76
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:19.267 line:82%
Let's start with the names.

77
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:22.187 line:82%
I'm Samya Siddique. You are?

78
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.819 line:82%
Do you want me to call you 786,
like the others do?

79
00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:35.033 line:82%
I'm sure your name isn't that bad
that you'd like to be known by numbers.

80
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.208 line:82%
Veer Pratap Singh.

81
00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:51.007 line:82%
You're hearing your name
after ages, right?

82
00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.307 line:82%
Veer Pratap Singh, please talk to me.

83
00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.601 line:82%
I'm here to help you.

84
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.981 line:82%
You were silent 22 years ago.

85
00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.442 line:82%
Hence, no one could defend you.

86
00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:14.989 line:82%
God is giving you another chance today.

87
00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:17.033 line:82%
Talk to me.

88
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:21.120 line:82%
I promise to get you back to India.

89
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:25.625 line:82%
Please talk to me. Please.

90
00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:34.509 line:82%
I don't know why
you don't want to be free.

91
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.805 line:82%
But let me tell you why your
freedom is important to me

92
00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.641 line:82%
and to the other girls of this country.

93
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.895 line:82%
My father, Tamaam Siddique

94
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.731 line:82%
fought for the rights
of women in this country.

95
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.903 line:82%
But he couldn't
accomplish what he wanted to.

96
00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.410 line:82%
After toiling for years,
I've got my first case.

97
00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:06.457 line:82%
But everyone knows
that winning this case is impossible.

98
00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.004 line:82%
They want me to lose.

99
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:15.091 line:82%
So that no woman dares to
step into the world of men again.

100
00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:22.515 line:82%
But I'm not going to lose.
I won't let my father's dream

101
00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.184 line:82%
and the strength of women fall weak.

102
00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:29.439 line:82%
I only need your help.

103
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:34.736 line:82%
Please talk to me. Please.

104
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.489 line:82%
Talk to me, Veer Pratap Singh.

105
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.949 line:82%
That´s an F16.

106
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:25.244 line:82%
It flew at the speed of
1,200 miles per hour.

107
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:33.461 line:82%
Piercing through the skies,
playing with the clouds

108
00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.589 line:82%
when a plane travels

109
00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:43.012 line:82%
no one else but a pilot
can understand how it feels.

110
00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:53.064 line:82%
I could actually
feel the heat in my palms

111
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.651 line:82%
the adrenaline rush

112
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.406 line:82%
and the gush of the winds

113
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:06.661 line:82%
when I was

114
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:12.542 line:82%
flying my helicopter.

115
00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.233 line:82%
Ahead, go left.

116
00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:44.157 line:82%
Help! Help, please.

117
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.492 line:82%
-Yes.
-Let's go get them.

118
00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.643 line:82%
Help! Help!

119
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:19.275 line:82%
That was me and that was my life.

120
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.444 line:82%
Squadron Leader, Veer Pratap Singh.

121
00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.781 line:82%
A rescue pilot with
the Indian Air Force.

122
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.242 line:82%
I enjoyed my job

123
00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:31.120 line:82%
because flying was my childhood hobby

124
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.791 line:82%
and rescuing people
was my father's heritage.

125
00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:39.545 line:82%
He was an army officer
who became a martyr.

126
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:44.133 line:82%
I was alone, free

127
00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:47.678 line:82%
and lived every moment to the fullest.

128
00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:50.890 line:82%
I didn't know that three days later

129
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.603 line:82%
I would lose the ability to sleep,
and the reason would be a girl.

130
00:14:56.938 --> 00:15:01.192 line:82%
A girl who was sleeping
peacefully in Pakistan.

131
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.574 line:82%
Wake up, dear Zaara! It's 7 a.m.

132
00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:11.994 line:82%
7 a.m.! I've never woken up this early!

133
00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:15.540 line:82%
Do what you haven't done before.

134
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.667 line:82%
Your match has been fixed.

135
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.253 line:82%
You're here only for a few more days.

136
00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:23.256 line:82%
You'll soon get
married and go to your in-laws.

137
00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:26.551 line:82%
Hence, change your mannerisms.

138
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:30.847 line:82%
Wake up at 7 a.m. and make your bed.

139
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:34.684 line:82%
And then, learn to cook from Iqbal.

140
00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.228 line:82%
I'm not going to change for anyone.

141
00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:39.021 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am.

142
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:44.026 line:82%
-Go and tell him.
-You can't throw tantrums now.

143
00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:47.780 line:82%
Be thankful that they only
saw you and fixed the alliance.

144
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.158 line:82%
What if they refuse on
seeing your behavior?

145
00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.951 line:82%
You'll remain a spinster for good.

146
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:10.553 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

147
00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:25.443 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

148
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:30.531 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

149
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:35.494 line:82%
Whether you like it or not,
I don't care

150
00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:40.374 line:82%
I'm not going to change for anyone

151
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:45.087 line:82%
Whether anyone understands
or not, this is how it's going to be

152
00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:50.009 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

153
00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:55.348 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

154
00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:39.558 line:82%
I'm the queen of hearts
I do as I please

155
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:49.068 line:82%
I'm the queen of hearts
I do as I please

156
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:54.073 line:82%
Why should I cover my head?
I don't care if the veil drops

157
00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:59.078 line:82%
Whether this makes
someone happy or upset

158
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:03.541 line:82%
this is set in stone

159
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:08.296 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

160
00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:13.718 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

161
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:07.855 line:82%
I don't dream of getting married

162
00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:17.281 line:82%
I don't dream of getting married

163
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:21.994 line:82%
My home is my paradise

164
00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:27.333 line:82%
Listen to this, boys

165
00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:31.670 line:82%
I don't think I'm ever
going to be ready

166
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:36.592 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

167
00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:41.764 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

168
00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:46.685 line:82%
Whether you like it or not,
I don't care

169
00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:51.273 line:82%
I'm not going to change for anyone

170
00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:56.195 line:82%
Whether anyone understands or not,
this is how it's going to be

171
00:19:56.195 --> 00:20:01.117 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am

172
00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:06.414 line:82%
I'm going to be the way I am.

173
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:39.613 line:82%
Mr. Yusuf, is everything all right?

174
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:44.034 line:82%
Pray to God. There's no time
to take her to the hospital either.

175
00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:48.038 line:82%
She's been calling out to Zaara.

176
00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:51.250 line:82%
Mr. Yusuf, I'm Zaara's mother.

177
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.670 line:82%
But it was her who fulfilled
all the duties.

178
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.046 line:82%
Where is Zaara?

179
00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:59.758 line:82%
She's gone to the mosque
to get holy water.

180
00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:04.763 line:82%
I'll give this news to Zaara myself.
No one else will say a word to her.

181
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:25.826 line:82%
Zaara, you're back!

182
00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:32.374 line:82%
Yes, Grandma. I'm back.
And look what I've got you.

183
00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:34.919 line:82%
I've got the special holy water for you.

184
00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:37.838 line:82%
-And I...
-I know, dear.

185
00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:41.091 line:82%
-No holy water is going to work.
-Listen--

186
00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:45.179 line:82%
You've been chattering
since you were little.

187
00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:47.723 line:82%
And I've only listened.

188
00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:51.310 line:82%
But today,
I'm going to talk and you'll listen.

189
00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:01.877 line:82%
You know,
I'm as old as Pakistan.

190
00:22:02.192 --> 00:22:04.532 line:82%
I was 16 years old

191
00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:09.203 line:82%
when your grandpa left India after
the partition, and came here.

192
00:22:09.703 --> 00:22:11.539 line:82%
He brought me along.

193
00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:16.085 line:82%
Your family and this
country have given me a lot.

194
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:19.255 line:82%
And I've been happy with you all, too.

195
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:23.467 line:82%
But today, I have one last wish.

196
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.845 line:82%
Will you fulfill that?

197
00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:32.977 line:82%
I want you to immerse my
ashes in the rivers of India, dear.

198
00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:37.523 line:82%
I may be an orphan,
but I am Indian, after all.

199
00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:40.943 line:82%
This is my only identity, dear.

200
00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:44.655 line:82%
I told you about Kiratpur, right?

201
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:48.284 line:82%
It's the biggest
pilgrimage for us Sikhs.

202
00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:50.869 line:82%
All my ancestors are there.

203
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.373 line:82%
Take my ashes there.

204
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:57.418 line:82%
I'll find salvation.

205
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.756 line:82%
You'll do this for me, won't you?

206
00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:07.553 line:82%
No.

207
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.474 line:82%
There won't be a need to do that.

208
00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:15.477 line:82%
All of us have got our Delhi visas.

209
00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:20.399 line:82%
Just get well soon
and then we'll go to Kiratpur together.

210
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:23.652 line:82%
So that you can pay homage.

211
00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:26.196 line:82%
Come on, drink this holy water now.

212
00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:29.408 line:82%
Grandma.

213
00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:33.579 line:82%
Grandma?

214
00:23:34.997 --> 00:23:37.082 line:82%
Grandma...

215
00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:07.696 line:82%
She was in Pakistan,
and you were in India.

216
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:11.784 line:82%
Then, when and how
did you two meet?

217
00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:19.833 line:82%
Three days later.

218
00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.838 line:82%
And that moment

219
00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:28.217 line:82%
was priceless.

220
00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:30.177 line:82%
Hurry up.

221
00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:35.474 line:82%
A bus had met with
an accident on the hills.

222
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:37.476 line:82%
There weren't many casualties.

223
00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:40.646 line:82%
All the passengers were rescued.

224
00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:43.273 line:82%
Only one girl was left.

225
00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:47.528 line:82%
And I got down once again
to rescue her.

226
00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:19.935 line:82%
Pull us up.

227
00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:29.319 line:82%
I'd be lying if I said
I never saw a girl as pretty as her.

228
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:34.950 line:82%
But I wonder why
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

229
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:39.747 line:82%
She was looking down.
She was breathing fast.

230
00:25:40.414 --> 00:25:42.374 line:82%
She was petrified.

231
00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.670 line:82%
A strand of hair was
getting in her right eye.

232
00:25:47.796 --> 00:25:50.090 line:82%
She was trying to move it,

233
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.802 line:82%
but the winds were strong
and the strand was still there.

234
00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:58.015 line:82%
I moved that strand
of hair from her face

235
00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:00.851 line:82%
and she looked at me nervously.

236
00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:05.731 line:82%
That was the first time
we looked at each other.

237
00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:09.109 line:82%
She kept staring at me in fear.

238
00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:12.571 line:82%
Then, slowly

239
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:16.241 line:82%
she looked down,
but I kept looking at her.

240
00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:19.495 line:82%
And then, the rope broke.

241
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.957 line:82%
Stop!

242
00:26:23.957 --> 00:26:25.959 line:82%
-Ranjit, stop it!
-What happened!

243
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:27.503 line:82%
Stop!

244
00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:29.963 line:82%
What happened?

245
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:32.049 line:82%
I've dropped my bag. Please put me down.

246
00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:33.634 line:82%
It's only a bag, ma'am. Let it go.

247
00:26:33.634 --> 00:26:36.762 line:82%
No, I can't let it go.
It's precious to me.

248
00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:38.597 line:82%
Is it more precious than our lives?

249
00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:41.433 line:82%
Yes, it is. Now will you please
take me down or should I go myself?

250
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.227 line:82%
Get me down! Now!

251
00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:44.728 line:82%
-Hold on!
-My bag!

252
00:26:44.728 --> 00:26:46.480 line:82%
Stop it!

253
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.524 line:82%
-Ranjit, take us down.
-Veer, have you gone mad!

254
00:26:48.524 --> 00:26:50.901 line:82%
Do as I say! Take us down!

255
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.790 line:82%
Here. Ranjit, pull us up.

256
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:24.226 line:82%
You risked the lives of several
people today just for a bag.

257
00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:27.521 line:82%
What kind of a person are you?!

258
00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:29.982 line:82%
Do you know?

259
00:27:30.232 --> 00:27:33.277 line:82%
We risk our lives every day
to save people's lives.

260
00:27:33.277 --> 00:27:36.655 line:82%
They are strangers.
They are not related to us in any way.

261
00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:41.076 line:82%
Still, when we go home, we feel proud.

262
00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:45.664 line:82%
Since we saved the life of someone's
sister, wife, brother or mother.

263
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:48.125 line:82%
We gave someone a new life.

264
00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:51.670 line:82%
But today, for the first time
in all these years, I'm doubting myself.

265
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:53.797 line:82%
For the first time,

266
00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:58.510 line:82%
I feel it's futile risking
my life for someone else's.

267
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.471 line:82%
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but it was disgusting.

268
00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:12.357 line:82%
Get lost!
I don't wish to see your face!

269
00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:15.736 line:82%
Who told you to give Zaara your money!

270
00:28:15.736 --> 00:28:19.489 line:82%
You know I can't refuse Zaara.

271
00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:21.867 line:82%
Even if I did,
she would have snatched it from me.

272
00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:25.329 line:82%
Couldn't you have told me
that she was going to India,

273
00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:27.080 line:82%
not to the local market?!

274
00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:30.876 line:82%
She made me swear on our friendship.

275
00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:34.588 line:82%
You swore on your friendship?
There's a limit to being childish!

276
00:28:34.588 --> 00:28:36.214 line:82%
Who helped her board the bus?

277
00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:38.717 line:82%
Call Akram, immediately!

278
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.219 line:82%
-How could someone be so irresponsible!
-Hello.

279
00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.888 line:82%
-Zaara!
-Zaara!

280
00:28:42.888 --> 00:28:44.306 line:82%
Zaara, how are you?

281
00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:45.891 line:82%
-Give it to me!
-Zaara!

282
00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:49.353 line:82%
Mom, I'm fine. Don't worry.

283
00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.438 line:82%
What kind of insolence is this, Zaara!

284
00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:54.942 line:82%
Do you know how worried I am here?

285
00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:58.987 line:82%
I was about to inform the police
when this Shabbo told me the truth.

286
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:04.618 line:82%
-Just come home immediately.
-Mom, the border closes at 4:30.

287
00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:08.038 line:82%
And I haven't even reached Kiratpur yet.

288
00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:13.335 line:82%
Dear Lord! What am I being
punished for? It's almost dusk and...

289
00:29:13.335 --> 00:29:15.087 line:82%
How could you go all by yourself!

290
00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:18.840 line:82%
I promised you that
I'd send the ashes to India.

291
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.259 line:82%
But I made a promise to grandma too

292
00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:23.136 line:82%
that I'd personally take the ashes.

293
00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:25.639 line:82%
Zaara, you're not in Lahore anymore.

294
00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:27.265 line:82%
You're in another country.

295
00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:30.268 line:82%
-Are you crazy?
-I'm really sorry, Mom.

296
00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:36.316 line:82%
But you couldn't understand me
even though I tried.

297
00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:40.529 line:82%
I've never done anything
special in my life, Mom.

298
00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:44.825 line:82%
And I'm not going to do
anything great in my future.

299
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:47.536 line:82%
My life will also be spent

300
00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:50.664 line:82%
trying to be a good wife
and mother, just like you.

301
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:55.127 line:82%
But if I do this, I'll be proud

302
00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:58.380 line:82%
that I did something to
help someone's soul rest in peace.

303
00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:06.054 line:82%
Since I've come this far,
I'll return only once I'm done.

304
00:30:07.097 --> 00:30:10.892 line:82%
But if you stay upset with me,
then my journey will be jinxed.

305
00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:14.146 line:82%
Stop this nonsense! A mother
can never jinx her daughter's happiness.

306
00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:15.480 line:82%
I've been crying
for the past eight hours.

307
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.649 line:82%
Don't make me cry anymore.

308
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:20.152 line:82%
Relax, Mom. I'm cool.

309
00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:23.447 line:82%
Yes, you're cool and we're all fools.

310
00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:26.950 line:82%
If your father returns
before you, then...

311
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.620 line:82%
Don't worry, Mom.
Dad will return next week.

312
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.832 line:82%
-I'll be back by tomorrow. Okay?
-Ma'am, please.

313
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.710 line:82%
Yes. Mom, I'm hanging up.
There's a line behind me.

314
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.005 line:82%
Listen, take care.
And be careful about what you eat.

315
00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:43.341 line:82%
Don't interact with strangers
and do keep calling me.

316
00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:47.721 line:82%
Okay? And don't worry,
my blessings are with you.

317
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:51.391 line:82%
-Okay, dear. Bye.
-Bye.

318
00:30:51.391 --> 00:30:54.936 line:82%
-How much do I have to pay?
-You were worrying for no reason.

319
00:30:54.936 --> 00:31:00.067 line:82%
Zaara is no less than a boy.
She can have her way anywhere.

320
00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:02.694 line:82%
Thank God, she's all right.

321
00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:06.865 line:82%
This girl almost killed me.

322
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.325 line:82%
Why are you talking to me?

323
00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:10.077 line:82%
I told you to get lost!

324
00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:12.662 line:82%
You say that every time.

325
00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:16.666 line:82%
-We're cool!
-Shut up! To hell with you!

326
00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:20.045 line:82%
Get to work now!
What are you standing here for! Go!

327
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:27.803 line:82%
Ranjit, my leave has been approved.

328
00:31:27.803 --> 00:31:29.888 line:82%
Mom and dad wanted
me to come home for Lohri.

329
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:32.099 line:82%
I'll reach faster if
I leave from here in the morning.

330
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:33.517 line:82%
Negi will accompany you back.

331
00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:36.728 line:82%
-Okay. See you on Monday. Enjoy.
-Thank you. Praise the Lord.

332
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:40.190 line:82%
Excuse me. Is there a bus here
that goes to Kiratpur?

333
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.067 line:82%
No, there's no bus as of now.

334
00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:44.236 line:82%
There's a bus for
Kiratpur at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

335
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.656 line:82%
Is there a hotel around
to spend the night?

336
00:31:47.656 --> 00:31:51.910 line:82%
Hotel? Sure! There's an eatery.

337
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.954 line:82%
That's like a five-star hotel for us.

338
00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:57.207 line:82%
A blanket for 10 rupees
and a bed for 25 rupees.

339
00:31:57.207 --> 00:32:00.669 line:82%
Okay, ma'am,
I'll take your leave. Good night.

340
00:32:42.836 --> 00:32:46.131 line:82%
You risk your lives
to save the lives of strangers.

341
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.301 line:82%
Nothing could be nobler than that.

342
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:55.223 line:82%
I don't want you to feel
less proud of your job because of me.

343
00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:57.809 line:82%
That's why I'm here
to tell you why I was being stupid.

344
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:01.980 line:82%
These are my grandmother's ashes.

345
00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:06.026 line:82%
She was Indian.

346
00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:10.405 line:82%
She spent her life serving
my family in Pakistan.

347
00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:15.202 line:82%
She never asked for anything in return.
Just one last wish.

348
00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:19.331 line:82%
She wanted her ashes to be
immersed in the rivers of Kiratput,

349
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:21.166 line:82%
with her ancestors.

350
00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:25.754 line:82%
This is more precious than my life.

351
00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:30.550 line:82%
Perhaps, you weren't
too keen on saving my life.

352
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.054 line:82%
But I believe that
you must certainly be proud

353
00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:38.350 line:82%
after knowing that you saved
this urn in my bag.

354
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.940 line:82%
Please forgive me if you can.

355
00:33:47.234 --> 00:33:49.027 line:82%
I'm sorry.

356
00:33:56.076 --> 00:33:59.537 line:82%
-Sir, here's your buttermilk.
-Give me.

357
00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:04.125 line:82%
If I had buttermilk in the morning,
I wouldn't be hot-headed.

358
00:34:17.681 --> 00:34:20.725 line:82%
Listen, I have a ticket! Look...

359
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:23.561 line:82%
Go in. Let them on.

360
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.523 line:82%
-Listen...
-Watch out!

361
00:34:26.523 --> 00:34:28.733 line:82%
Easy... Careful...

362
00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:31.403 line:82%
That's it. No more passengers.

363
00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:34.656 line:82%
-Listen, I have a ticket.
-Everyone has a ticket, ma'am.

364
00:34:34.656 --> 00:34:36.616 line:82%
We believe in first come, first serve.

365
00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:39.327 line:82%
-So, then, where do I sit?
-Go up.

366
00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:47.460 line:82%
Hey! Back off.

367
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.130 line:82%
-Why should I move?
-Why not?

368
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:54.301 line:82%
Is my wife your sister
that you want to sit with her?

369
00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:56.594 line:82%
Move, or I'll break your teeth.

370
00:34:56.594 --> 00:35:00.932 line:82%
-Please sit. I wasn't aware.
-Hey...

371
00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:08.773 line:82%
You must be wondering why I'm here.

372
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:14.029 line:82%
Well, do you see that bus over there?

373
00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:17.615 line:82%
Actually,
I should have been on that bus.

374
00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:19.034 line:82%
I was even seated inside.

375
00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:23.455 line:82%
But then, I saw you.
I saw how easily

376
00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:25.415 line:82%
you took this luxurious seat.

377
00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:31.546 line:82%
I thought, either you're brave,
or you're stupid.

378
00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:35.008 line:82%
You've come alone
on such a long journey.

379
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.970 line:82%
Then, I also thought
that I will reach my village

380
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.183 line:82%
but all my life, I'll keep wondering

381
00:35:43.183 --> 00:35:45.518 line:82%
whether that silly girl from Pakistan

382
00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:48.438 line:82%
reached her destination safely or not.

383
00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:52.817 line:82%
So, don't be under the impression
that I'm here to help you.

384
00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.486 line:82%
I'm here

385
00:35:55.028 --> 00:35:58.031 line:82%
so that I'm not bothered
by this thought forever.

386
00:35:58.031 --> 00:35:59.741 line:82%
Thank you.

387
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:01.993 line:82%
Would you like to have chole?

388
00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:09.250 line:82%
I'm Squadron Leader,
Veer Pratap Singh.

389
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:12.629 line:82%
I'm Zaara. Zaara Hayat Khan.

390
00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:32.565 line:82%
The land is below the blue skies

391
00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:37.946 line:82%
The weather is always beautiful

392
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:46.913 line:82%
This is how beautiful my country is

393
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:57.287 line:82%
This is how beautiful my country is

394
00:37:10.437 --> 00:37:16.401 line:82%
The land is golden,
and the skies are blue

395
00:37:16.401 --> 00:37:21.698 line:82%
The land is golden, the skies
are blue and every season is colorful

396
00:37:21.698 --> 00:37:27.328 line:82%
That's my country
That's my country

397
00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:33.334 line:82%
That's my country

398
00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:39.257 line:82%
The birds are singing

399
00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:44.721 line:82%
The birds are singing while it rains

400
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:50.351 line:82%
That's my country
That's my country

401
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:57.108 line:82%
That's my country

402
00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:43.112 line:82%
Winds gush through the fields

403
00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:49.702 line:82%
Many colorful veils are flying

404
00:38:54.624 --> 00:39:00.129 line:82%
When the ladies come
to the lake to fill their pots

405
00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:05.510 line:82%
someone plays the flute melodiously

406
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:10.765 line:82%
At every step...

407
00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:17.355 line:82%
At every step, you'll find a love story

408
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:22.819 line:82%
That's my country

409
00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:29.117 line:82%
That's my country

410
00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:47.385 line:82%
My beloved passes by

411
00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:49.554 line:82%
the one who has fallen in love with her

412
00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:51.931 line:82%
Oh, my beloved!

413
00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:57.228 line:82%
My beloved is amazing,
she chants the name of God

414
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:07.488 line:82%
You impressed me, sweetheart!

415
00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:17.415 line:82%
Kids hop on their father's shoulders
and see the fair

416
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:23.421 line:82%
There are plays and
ice-cream stalls at the fair

417
00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:34.766 line:82%
You'll find all sorts
of refreshments here

418
00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:40.104 line:82%
The innocent kids
are no less than dolls

419
00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:46.694 line:82%
Their grandmothers...

420
00:40:46.694 --> 00:40:52.158 line:82%
Their grandmothers tell them
tales of fairies every day

421
00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:57.455 line:82%
That's my country

422
00:40:57.455 --> 00:41:00.917 line:82%
That's my country

423
00:41:00.917 --> 00:41:04.170 line:82%
That's my country

424
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:14.180 line:82%
You're going out of control, lady

425
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:19.143 line:82%
You seem to be flying in the air

426
00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:24.649 line:82%
You seem to be flying in the air

427
00:41:25.733 --> 00:41:30.071 line:82%
Who's going to bear
your tantrums, lady?

428
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:35.076 line:82%
Who's going to bear
your attitude, lady?

429
00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:41.082 line:82%
Who's going to bear your attitude, lady?

430
00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:52.969 line:82%
Guests are revered in my country

431
00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:59.517 line:82%
The one who comes here
doesn't want to leave, ever

432
00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:10.570 line:82%
I've seen and known your country

433
00:42:16.075 --> 00:42:21.831 line:82%
I've seen and known your country

434
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:27.295 line:82%
I wonder why it seems familiar to me

435
00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:33.634 line:82%
It's the same dusk and dawn here

436
00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:36.721 line:82%
It's the same dawn and dusk

437
00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:39.140 line:82%
My country is

438
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.895 line:82%
the same as yours

439
00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:47.565 line:82%
My country is the same as yours

440
00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:53.404 line:82%
That's my country,
it's just like yours

441
00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:59.368 line:82%
My country is just like yours

442
00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:02.413 line:82%
My country...

443
00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:06.667 line:82%
Is just like mine.

444
00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:47.208 line:82%
-What are these people doing?
-Last rites are being performed.

445
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:49.836 line:82%
They do this before immersing the ashes.

446
00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:51.671 line:82%
So, why aren't we doing this?

447
00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:56.676 line:82%
We aren't doing this because you are
a Muslim, and this is a Sikh Gurudwara.

448
00:43:56.676 --> 00:44:01.013 line:82%
So, you better immerse
the ashes in the water and leave.

449
00:44:01.013 --> 00:44:05.476 line:82%
No. I want to immerse
the ashes ritualistically.

450
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:10.231 line:82%
No, Zaara. You see,
some priests are very strict.

451
00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:11.899 line:82%
Not only will you be humiliated,

452
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:14.026 line:82%
but I'll be beaten too.

453
00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:15.278 line:82%
Can I ask them?

454
00:44:15.278 --> 00:44:18.072 line:82%
No, you don't go.
Stay here. I'll ask them.

455
00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:20.950 line:82%
Have a seat here, please.

456
00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:26.122 line:82%
The Lord's name is the ultimate.

457
00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:30.418 line:82%
I told you about Kiratpur, right?

458
00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:34.964 line:82%
Immerse my ashes in the rivers
over there. I'll find salvation.

459
00:44:52.899 --> 00:44:54.942 line:82%
-Is your name Zaara?
-Yes.

460
00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:57.486 line:82%
-Are you from Pakistan?
-Yes.

461
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:03.868 line:82%
I've been serving this
holy place for the past 42 years.

462
00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.203 line:82%
I've never seen such
devotion in a person before.

463
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:12.543 line:82%
Even one's own child wouldn't have done
what you're doing, dear.

464
00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:16.339 line:82%
I'd be fortunate to conduct
prayers for your grandmother.

465
00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:19.967 line:82%
Come with me, dear. Come.

466
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.808 line:82%
Thank you, dear Lord!
You're great.

467
00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:56.587 line:82%
Please come here.

468
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:02.468 line:82%
What is it now?

469
00:46:02.468 --> 00:46:07.098 line:82%
Bring your hand forward, and fulfill
grandma's last wish along with me.

470
00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:11.143 line:82%
But, how can I...

471
00:46:11.143 --> 00:46:14.855 line:82%
Look, neither am I grandma's
biological child, nor are you.

472
00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:19.777 line:82%
But if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have been able

473
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.862 line:82%
to bring grandma's
ashes here so easily.

474
00:46:23.572 --> 00:46:27.451 line:82%
You too have formed
a bond with my grandma now.

475
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:32.248 line:82%
So, along with me, you have the right
to perform this last ritual too. Come.

476
00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:07.533 line:82%
Zaara, here's your bus ticket.

477
00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:10.911 line:82%
This will take you to Atari,
and then, take a train to Lahore.

478
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:14.040 line:82%
Here's the change.
Have you finished eating?

479
00:47:15.708 --> 00:47:21.047 line:82%
-Anything else?
-No, thanks. You've already done a lot.

480
00:47:21.047 --> 00:47:25.051 line:82%
I don't know how to thank you.

481
00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:26.635 line:82%
I'm quite frank about all this.

482
00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:28.721 line:82%
If you insist, I'll tell you.

483
00:47:28.721 --> 00:47:32.641 line:82%
Please tell me.
What can I do for you?

484
00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:34.727 line:82%
Think about it.
I'll ask you for it,

485
00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:37.146 line:82%
but you might not be able
to give it to me.

486
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:41.442 line:82%
You have no idea how
big a favor you've done me.

487
00:47:41.442 --> 00:47:44.904 line:82%
You can ask for whatever you want.
I promise, I'll fulfill it.

488
00:47:46.197 --> 00:47:49.575 line:82%
You're promising without
even knowing what it is.

489
00:47:49.575 --> 00:47:51.869 line:82%
You might repent later.

490
00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:54.580 line:82%
A Pakistani has promised an Indian.

491
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.583 line:82%
This concerns the honor of my country.

492
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:59.877 line:82%
I can't go back on
my word now even if I want to.

493
00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:02.797 line:82%
Tell me, what can I do for you?

494
00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:07.885 line:82%
Give me another day of your life.

495
00:48:11.097 --> 00:48:15.935 line:82%
-What?
-You brought me close to your life.

496
00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:19.897 line:82%
You made me form a bond
with your grandmother.

497
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:23.567 line:82%
You've given me a lifelong memory.

498
00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:30.324 line:82%
I want to show you my world
and introduce you to my people.

499
00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:34.912 line:82%
I want to give you
a lifelong memory too.

500
00:48:38.791 --> 00:48:42.378 line:82%
I know this day is
quite precious for you

501
00:48:42.378 --> 00:48:44.713 line:82%
but I promise,

502
00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:47.133 line:82%
you'll never be able
to forget this day.

503
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:58.519 line:82%
I told you, you'd regret
making that promise.

504
00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:18.372 line:82%
So, you fell in love with her.

505
00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:25.045 line:82%
I still couldn't understand...

506
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:30.551 line:82%
what was wrong with me.

507
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:37.600 line:82%
I don't know why I asked
her for another day. I just did.

508
00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:43.522 line:82%
But even then, I knew

509
00:49:43.522 --> 00:49:47.818 line:82%
that our meeting could not end there.

510
00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:52.239 line:82%
We didn't meet to separate eventually.

511
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:58.495 line:82%
Our relationship was incomplete.

512
00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:01.665 line:82%
There was something left to be done.

513
00:50:04.877 --> 00:50:06.670 line:82%
That's what I thought

514
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.798 line:82%
and hence, I kept saying
what came to mind.

515
00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:13.761 line:82%
And she quietly listened.

516
00:50:16.597 --> 00:50:18.182 line:82%
Did she stay back?

517
00:50:21.477 --> 00:50:23.354 line:82%
Samya...

518
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:26.857 line:82%
it concerned the honor of your Pakistan.

519
00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:32.655 line:82%
She had to come.

520
00:50:42.331 --> 00:50:46.502 line:82%
Why are you upset?
Did your mom scold you over the phone?

521
00:50:46.502 --> 00:50:51.173 line:82%
-I'm scared of heights!
-Oh! Why didn't you tell me that?

522
00:50:51.674 --> 00:50:54.468 line:82%
You said it was a shortcut.

523
00:50:54.468 --> 00:50:58.055 line:82%
The other route would take us
half the day. I had no choice.

524
00:50:58.055 --> 00:51:02.059 line:82%
So, are you going to be
petrified throughout the journey?

525
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:04.895 line:82%
Please smile as you're
scaring me with that face.

526
00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:09.817 line:82%
Okay, look. Eat some nuts.
It'll take your mind off it.

527
00:51:10.693 --> 00:51:14.196 line:82%
-Bring your hand forward.
-No.

528
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.532 line:82%
Okay, open your mouth.

529
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:23.289 line:82%
You want more?

530
00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:41.077 line:82%
Brother Veer is here!

531
00:51:41.167 --> 00:51:44.893 line:82%
Brother Veer is here!
There's a girl with him!

532
00:51:45.311 --> 00:51:49.398 line:82%
Brother Veer is here!
There's a girl with him!

533
00:51:49.398 --> 00:51:53.777 line:82%
Pappu's mother, look,
Veer has brought along his fiancée.

534
00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:56.905 line:82%
No! His fiancée
couldn't have come with him.

535
00:51:56.905 --> 00:51:59.116 line:82%
Veer must have married her.

536
00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:01.201 line:82%
She must be his wife.

537
00:52:01.201 --> 00:52:05.998 line:82%
Aunt! Aunt!

538
00:52:07.249 --> 00:52:09.877 line:82%
Aunt!

539
00:52:10.544 --> 00:52:13.172 line:82%
Aunt! Aunt!

540
00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:20.054 line:82%
What is it? What's wrong?

541
00:52:20.054 --> 00:52:22.848 line:82%
-Aunt, Veer is back!
-Veer!

542
00:52:22.848 --> 00:52:26.185 line:82%
Yes, and his wife is with him.

543
00:52:26.185 --> 00:52:31.065 line:82%
That's ridiculous! Veer can never
get married without my permission.

544
00:52:31.065 --> 00:52:35.152 line:82%
I'm telling the truth, Aunt.
The village is out to see him.

545
00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:43.160 line:82%
Fine! Let him come.
I won't talk to him.

546
00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:50.042 line:82%
Chaudhary Sumer Singh!
Listen! Where is he?

547
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:00.844 line:82%
Behind me!

548
00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:11.522 line:82%
Chaudhary Sumer Singh!

549
00:53:13.315 --> 00:53:15.359 line:82%
Chaudhary Sumer Singh!

550
00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:19.530 line:82%
-Sir, your wife is calling you.
-Yes.

551
00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:21.824 line:82%
She always calls me at the wrong time.

552
00:53:21.824 --> 00:53:24.076 line:82%
Come here, dear.
Let me tell you something.

553
00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:29.289 line:82%
Don't ever get married. If you do,
you'll never do well in sports.

554
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.458 line:82%
-Chaudhary Sumer Singh!
-Okay.

555
00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:34.837 line:82%
Coming... Oh, my wife!

556
00:53:35.337 --> 00:53:37.965 line:82%
I've told you several times not to
disturb me when I'm playing. What is it?

557
00:53:37.965 --> 00:53:42.678 line:82%
I've also told you several
times that you must die on the bed.

558
00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:46.849 line:82%
Why do you want to break
your bones by playing with kids?

559
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:49.143 line:82%
You know what?

560
00:53:49.143 --> 00:53:52.688 line:82%
No player in this village
can beat Sumer Singh.

561
00:53:52.688 --> 00:53:56.024 line:82%
You have no idea what
a player your son had proved to be.

562
00:53:56.024 --> 00:53:57.609 line:82%
Veer is back!

563
00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.486 line:82%
But he's not alone.

564
00:53:59.486 --> 00:54:01.447 line:82%
-Then?
-He's married.

565
00:54:01.447 --> 00:54:03.824 line:82%
Look over there.

566
00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:06.243 line:82%
Come. That's uncle and that's my aunt.

567
00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:08.162 line:82%
Brother Veer!

568
00:54:11.165 --> 00:54:14.293 line:82%
How are you all?

569
00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.091 line:82%
-How are you, Kamli?
-I'm fine.

570
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.427 line:82%
Let me go meet dad.
Greetings, Dad.

571
00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:24.803 line:82%
-You idiot!
-What's wrong?

572
00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:27.264 line:82%
You got married without
even asking or informing us!

573
00:54:27.264 --> 00:54:29.266 line:82%
Married... Who got married?

574
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:31.518 line:82%
-Who's she, then? My wife?
-No...

575
00:54:31.518 --> 00:54:33.353 line:82%
-She's your wife.
-I'll smack you.

576
00:54:33.353 --> 00:54:35.898 line:82%
-Then who's she?
-You're too much, Mom.

577
00:54:35.898 --> 00:54:39.276 line:82%
Can there be only one
relationship between a boy and a girl?

578
00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:42.154 line:82%
Greetings!
She's our guest, Dad.

579
00:54:42.154 --> 00:54:45.657 line:82%
I rescued her and brought her
here to see my village and family.

580
00:54:45.657 --> 00:54:47.618 line:82%
You think she's my wife?

581
00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:56.210 line:82%
The minute I saw her, I knew

582
00:54:56.210 --> 00:55:00.506 line:82%
that this idiot could never get
a girl as beautiful as her.

583
00:55:00.506 --> 00:55:05.052 line:82%
-What's your name, dear?
-Zaara. Zaara Hayat Khan.

584
00:55:05.052 --> 00:55:08.388 line:82%
That's a lovely name.
Where are you from, dear?

585
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:11.642 line:82%
-Well, from Pakistan.
-There you go! That's amazing!

586
00:55:11.642 --> 00:55:14.520 line:82%
You've become our
extra special guest now.

587
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.065 line:82%
Look, we've always served
the people of our country.

588
00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:20.943 line:82%
This is our first opportunity to serve
someone from the neighboring country.

589
00:55:20.943 --> 00:55:23.237 line:82%
What would you like?
Should I get you milk or buttermilk?

590
00:55:23.237 --> 00:55:24.988 line:82%
Stop it now.

591
00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:28.492 line:82%
Come with me, dear.
He'll go on chattering till night.

592
00:55:28.492 --> 00:55:30.035 line:82%
-Come with me.
-Never mind...

593
00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:31.703 line:82%
-Excuse us.
-With pleasure.

594
00:55:34.373 --> 00:55:36.708 line:82%
-Hey, Veer! Where are you going?
-Well, I...

595
00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:38.460 line:82%
Wait a minute.

596
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.712 line:82%
-Okay, get back to work, everyone!
-We're going.

597
00:55:40.712 --> 00:55:42.965 line:82%
-Yes. What happened?
-Wait...

598
00:55:42.965 --> 00:55:45.133 line:82%
Tell me.

599
00:55:45.133 --> 00:55:47.928 line:82%
Well, did you get
what I had asked you to?

600
00:55:47.928 --> 00:55:52.349 line:82%
Yes, here is your bottle of rum.

601
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:53.934 line:82%
-But you can't drink alone.
-No, absolutely not.

602
00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:56.937 line:82%
Listen, if mom catches
you this time, I won't lie.

603
00:55:57.563 --> 00:56:00.107 line:82%
Just once... One last time.

604
00:56:01.275 --> 00:56:04.528 line:82%
-Okay, one last time.
-Go on. Go...

605
00:56:06.989 --> 00:56:08.949 line:82%
Cheers to the neighboring country!

606
00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:22.963 line:82%
-Let me do it.
-No, I'll manage.

607
00:56:22.963 --> 00:56:25.048 line:82%
The way you're doing it clearly shows

608
00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:27.384 line:82%
that someone else
does your hair at home.

609
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:29.553 line:82%
Come, let me do it.

610
00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:32.806 line:82%
Consider this your home. Come.

611
00:56:34.433 --> 00:56:37.144 line:82%
-Is this Veer's room?
-Yes.

612
00:56:38.145 --> 00:56:42.649 line:82%
Whenever he brought a medal
or a picture, I'd put it up here.

613
00:56:43.942 --> 00:56:46.236 line:82%
And when he isn't at home

614
00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:49.448 line:82%
his father and I have
a look at his things here.

615
00:56:50.991 --> 00:56:52.826 line:82%
The three of you love each other a lot.

616
00:56:54.202 --> 00:56:57.831 line:82%
We have no one else
to share our love with.

617
00:56:57.831 --> 00:57:01.418 line:82%
He was very young
when his parents died.

618
00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:03.086 line:82%
Since then, it's just us.

619
00:57:03.879 --> 00:57:07.049 line:82%
We're actually his uncle and aunt

620
00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:10.594 line:82%
but he addresses us as his parents.

621
00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:14.848 line:82%
We don't have a child of our own.

622
00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:19.019 line:82%
It's just the three of us.

623
00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:22.314 line:82%
Hey! Here you go.
Your braid is done.

624
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:27.361 line:82%
Wow! I look just like you guys.

625
00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:29.071 line:82%
This is nothing.

626
00:57:29.071 --> 00:57:31.657 line:82%
You'll look like
a true Punjabi at night.

627
00:57:31.657 --> 00:57:35.869 line:82%
Today is Lohri,
and we celebrate it on a grand scale.

628
00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:39.539 line:82%
I'll give you the dress
that I wore on my first Lohri.

629
00:57:39.539 --> 00:57:41.708 line:82%
No, ma'am. I'll wear my clothes...

630
00:57:41.708 --> 00:57:45.462 line:82%
Hey! Don't argue with me.

631
00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:48.006 line:82%
Look, you've come for just a day

632
00:57:48.006 --> 00:57:50.592 line:82%
and for this one day,
be one with us.

633
00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:12.072 line:82%
-Are you comfortable?
-Yes.

634
00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:14.241 line:82%
Let me tell you,
when I was young

635
00:58:14.866 --> 00:58:17.619 line:82%
I used to take my wife
to Amritsar on a bicycle just like that.

636
00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:19.621 line:82%
What do I tell you?

637
00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:22.040 line:82%
She's put on so much weight
now that she can't sit on the bicycle.

638
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.960 line:82%
-But she's not that fat.
-I know better than you.

639
00:58:26.878 --> 00:58:30.966 line:82%
Veer was telling me that your wife
and you have built this village.

640
00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:35.053 line:82%
Yes. When we came here,
there were only farms.

641
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:38.974 line:82%
Earlier, we'd write letters
to request electricity.

642
00:58:38.974 --> 00:58:41.685 line:82%
-Do you see this hospital?
-Yes.

643
00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:43.520 line:82%
There used to be
a cowshed here.

644
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.855 line:82%
-How are you, Doctor?
-Hello.

645
00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:45.901 line:82%
Hello!

646
00:58:45.981 --> 00:58:47.858 line:82%
This is a school.

647
00:58:48.984 --> 00:58:53.822 line:82%
My wife and I were the first teachers.
No one was educated enough.

648
00:58:53.822 --> 00:58:56.825 line:82%
Now kids study through
the eighth grade here.

649
00:58:56.825 --> 00:59:02.205 line:82%
Later, we send the boys
to Kartarpur for further studies.

650
00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:06.376 line:82%
-What about the girls?
-How can we send the girls so far?

651
00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:09.296 line:82%
They have to stay back
and look after the household.

652
00:59:09.296 --> 00:59:12.257 line:82%
And anyway, what's the point of
getting them higher education?

653
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:13.884 line:82%
That's unfair, sir.

654
00:59:17.345 --> 00:59:22.559 line:82%
-Unfair? How?
-Don't misunderstand me, sir.

655
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:26.855 line:82%
What your wife and you have done
for this village is commendable.

656
00:59:26.855 --> 00:59:30.609 line:82%
You encouraged the
boys to fight the world.

657
00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:33.195 line:82%
But you made the girls weak.

658
00:59:33.779 --> 00:59:37.199 line:82%
That's why Veer is an Air Force pilot

659
00:59:37.199 --> 00:59:40.076 line:82%
but the girls in the village
remained illiterate.

660
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:44.372 line:82%
Girls have reached great heights, sir.

661
00:59:44.372 --> 00:59:47.375 line:82%
They are equal to boys.

662
00:59:47.375 --> 00:59:50.879 line:82%
Who knows,
maybe after being educated

663
00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:52.923 line:82%
a girl from this village could have been
much more successful than Veer.

664
00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:55.050 line:82%
Don't you think?

665
00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:57.761 line:82%
Chaudhary Sumer Singh!

666
00:59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.013 line:82%
-Where have you been?
-Oh, no!

667
01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:04.309 line:82%
Whenever I'm in the middle
of something important, she interrupts.

668
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:05.936 line:82%
Yes, what is it now?

669
01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:07.604 line:82%
It's time to perform
the rituals for Lohri.

670
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.898 line:82%
Come and change.

671
01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:13.985 line:82%
Okay, I'm coming.
Let's go, dear. Let's celebrate Lohri.

672
01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:25.121 line:82%
O' beautiful girl!
Who'll think of you?

673
01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:29.000 line:82%
Dulla of the Bhatti clan will,
she got married

674
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.964 line:82%
He gifted sugar,
the girl's shawl is torn

675
01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:38.426 line:82%
Who will stitch her shawl?
The landlords looted it

676
01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:42.764 line:82%
O' beautiful girl!
Who'll think of you?

677
01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:47.185 line:82%
Dulla of the Bhatti clan will,
she got married

678
01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:51.565 line:82%
Who'll think of you?
Dulla of the Bhatti clan will

679
01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:55.902 line:82%
O' beautiful girl!
Who'll think of you?

680
01:00:55.902 --> 01:01:00.073 line:82%
Dulla of the Bhatti clan will
Who'll think of you?

681
01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:05.161 line:82%
Dulla of the Bhatti clan will
O' beautiful girl!

682
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:10.500 line:82%
Come here, all of you!
Come on!

683
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.838 line:82%
Coming, Dad!
Let's go there. Coming!

684
01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:18.675 line:82%
Yes, listen.
Listen to me, everyone.

685
01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:24.347 line:82%
Look, we're not going to build
the cricket field here.

686
01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.182 line:82%
-Why, sir?
-I'll tell you the reason.

687
01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:30.353 line:82%
Instead, we're going to build
a high school for girls here.

688
01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.732 line:82%
The girls are happy.

689
01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:38.987 line:82%
I promise, once the school is built

690
01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:42.824 line:82%
no girl in the village will have to
leave the village for higher studies.

691
01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:45.285 line:82%
One more thing.

692
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:50.874 line:82%
Neither I, nor my wife will lay
the foundation of this school.

693
01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:55.462 line:82%
The one because of whom this school
is being built, will lay its foundation.

694
01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:57.005 line:82%
Ms. Zaara Hayat Khan.

695
01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.723 line:82%
Come here, dear.

696
01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:11.811 line:82%
Come.

697
01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:15.190 line:82%
-This is great.
-Sir, how can I...

698
01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:18.526 line:82%
Why not, dear?
You're so young

699
01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:21.154 line:82%
and yet you taught me
something so significant.

700
01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.239 line:82%
So, can't you do this for me?

701
01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.116 line:82%
Come on. Come.

702
01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.348 line:82%
Hey, listen! I'm Ginda Singh.

703
01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:51.309 line:82%
I really like you, beautiful!

704
01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:20.672 line:82%
Listen! I, Darshan Singh Aunkha,
am crazy about you!

705
01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:34.853 line:82%
-Aunt, is this a custom of Lohri?
-No, this custom was made by my husband.

706
01:03:35.302 --> 01:03:37.104 line:82%
What do you mean?

707
01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:42.360 line:82%
Look, in our times,
falling in love was forbidden.

708
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.447 line:82%
Moreover, I'm a South Indian,
whereas he's a Punjabi.

709
01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:50.535 line:82%
On the night of Lohri,
he proposed to me in front of everyone.

710
01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:54.539 line:82%
My parents couldn't refuse,
and we got married.

711
01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:59.461 line:82%
After that, whenever we celebrate
Lohri, he made it a custom.

712
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:03.673 line:82%
If a boy likes a girl, then
he has to confess in front of everyone.

713
01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.967 line:82%
If the girl wants to refuse,

714
01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.470 line:82%
then she should quietly
make offerings to the holy fire.

715
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.013 line:82%
And if she agrees,

716
01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:12.307 line:82%
then she should take the name
of the boy in front of everyone

717
01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:13.516 line:82%
and break a sugarcane.

718
01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:18.897 line:82%
-And then, we get them married.
-Wow! That's a lovely custom.

719
01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:23.026 line:82%
This means, if the boy and the girl
are willing, no one can do anything.

720
01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.320 line:82%
Saraswati Kaur!

721
01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:34.496 line:82%
My beloved!
I, Chaudhary Sumer Singh

722
01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:37.207 line:82%
propose marriage to you
for the next seven lives.

723
01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:49.094 line:82%
What do you think?
Come on, lady.

724
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.638 line:82%
I'll bring him to his senses.

725
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:55.517 line:82%
She'll break the sugarcane now.
Come on.

726
01:05:07.395 --> 01:05:08.404 line:82%
Mom!

727
01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.115 line:82%
What have you done!
She rejected my proposal!

728
01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:13.993 line:82%
No... Mom...
What have you done?

729
01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.162 line:82%
I mean, does dad stand no chance?

730
01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:20.166 line:82%
Tell him that if he wants to spend
the next seven lives with me,

731
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.127 line:82%
then he'll have to make
certain promises to me.

732
01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:25.922 line:82%
-Does he agree?
-What kind of promises? Mom...

733
01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:30.135 line:82%
I'm sorry, Dad, but I think
you should let go of the sugarcane now.

734
01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:33.721 line:82%
What? There you go.

735
01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:46.609 line:82%
I'm crazy about you

736
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:49.112 line:82%
Tell me what you want

737
01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:53.032 line:82%
All your demands will
be fulfilled, sweetheart

738
01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:55.952 line:82%
I'm crazy about you

739
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.830 line:82%
Tell me what you want

740
01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:02.876 line:82%
All your demands will
be fulfilled, sweetheart

741
01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:06.337 line:82%
I'm crazy about you

742
01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:10.967 line:82%
I know you
I understand your intentions

743
01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:16.014 line:82%
If you want to have me,
then listen to my conditions

744
01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:18.016 line:82%
I know you

745
01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:20.768 line:82%
I understand your intentions

746
01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:25.732 line:82%
If you want to have me,
then listen to my conditions

747
01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:28.026 line:82%
I know you

748
01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:31.279 line:82%
I understand your intentions...

749
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.624 line:82%
It's Lohri

750
01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:45.126 line:82%
Let's get together

751
01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:49.380 line:82%
I'll hold you in a way
that you won't be able to leave me

752
01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:52.300 line:82%
You won't be able to leave me

753
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.510 line:82%
Don't lie

754
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.180 line:82%
Don't act smart

755
01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:01.684 line:82%
You've broken all
the promises that you had made

756
01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:05.104 line:82%
You've broken all your promises

757
01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:11.694 line:82%
As soon as the sun sets,
he starts to drink with his friends

758
01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:16.115 line:82%
He gets totally drunk
What kind of a life is that?

759
01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.705 line:82%
You've got a point

760
01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.083 line:82%
I'll be careful

761
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:29.504 line:82%
Let me drink tonight
I promise I won't drink again

762
01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:35.885 line:82%
Once he starts drinking,
he'll lose his mind

763
01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:40.390 line:82%
-I'm crazy about you...
-Beloved...

764
01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:08.793 line:82%
I see you playing cards every day

765
01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:13.423 line:82%
You love gambling more than me

766
01:08:17.302 --> 01:08:22.098 line:82%
I won't act stupid
and play cards again

767
01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:26.728 line:82%
Now, it's just going to be you and me

768
01:08:28.146 --> 01:08:33.109 line:82%
Forget about the cards
and concentrate on me

769
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.403 line:82%
I know you

770
01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:38.614 line:82%
I understand your intentions...

771
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.792 line:82%
It's Lohri

772
01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.003 line:82%
Let's get together

773
01:08:52.503 --> 01:08:57.383 line:82%
I'll hold you in a way that
you won't be able to leave me

774
01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:59.761 line:82%
You won't be able to leave me

775
01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.929 line:82%
Don't lie

776
01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:04.057 line:82%
Don't act smart

777
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:09.604 line:82%
You've broken all
the promises that you made

778
01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:12.023 line:82%
You've broken all the promises...

779
01:09:21.574 --> 01:09:26.371 line:82%
You always forget
to bring what I ask for

780
01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:31.292 line:82%
You bring what you're not supposed to

781
01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.298 line:82%
I have a notebook now

782
01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.717 line:82%
I'll write it down

783
01:09:39.717 --> 01:09:44.514 line:82%
I'll get whatever you ask me to

784
01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:49.811 line:82%
It'll take time,
but he'll mend his ways

785
01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:55.483 line:82%
-I'm crazy about you...
-Beloved...

786
01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:20.800 line:82%
Whether you change or not,
you're mine

787
01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.722 line:82%
I want you to be mine forever...

788
01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:37.900 line:82%
I'm going to be
yours forever, sweetheart

789
01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:42.405 line:82%
You were, are and will always be mine

790
01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:47.994 line:82%
Where will he go without you?

791
01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:54.125 line:82%
I'm crazy about you...

792
01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:14.979 line:82%
It's Lohri

793
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:17.273 line:82%
Let's get together

794
01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:21.277 line:82%
I'll hold you in a way that
you won't be able to leave me

795
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.279 line:82%
Don't lie

796
01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:25.448 line:82%
Don't act smart

797
01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:29.911 line:82%
You've broken all
the promises that you made.

798
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:48.137 line:82%
Dad! Dad, you're here?

799
01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:50.515 line:82%
Mom asked me to look for you.

800
01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:53.142 line:82%
Come on, hurry up. The food is
getting cold. I need to leave. Come on.

801
01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.770 line:82%
Dear, come here.
Sit with me.

802
01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:03.486 line:82%
What's the matter, Dad?
What are you looking at?

803
01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:09.992 line:82%
I'm looking at my efforts, dear.

804
01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.869 line:82%
My treasure, my village.

805
01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:19.418 line:82%
I used to be proud of myself,
as I've helped this village develop.

806
01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:24.507 line:82%
But yesterday, that lovely girl

807
01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.509 line:82%
asked me an innocent question.

808
01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.219 line:82%
That made me realize

809
01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:31.222 line:82%
that I've done nothing
for the village yet.

810
01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.558 line:82%
There's still a lot to be done.

811
01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:39.814 line:82%
Dear, considering my age,
I don't think I'll be able to do a lot.

812
01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.483 line:82%
This village will be
abandoned after I'm gone.

813
01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:44.485 line:82%
Everything will remain incomplete.

814
01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:50.366 line:82%
I was wondering how
I'm going to do this.

815
01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:57.665 line:82%
What are you talking about, Dad?

816
01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:03.713 line:82%
I had a vision.
After your mom and I are gone

817
01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:07.675 line:82%
you're riding a cycle,
and your wife is seated behind you.

818
01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:09.510 line:82%
Then the village won't be abandoned,

819
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.762 line:82%
and nothing will be incomplete.
That's what I was thinking.

820
01:13:12.513 --> 01:13:15.266 line:82%
Why won't this dream come true?

821
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:21.397 line:82%
Well, you're Squadron Leader
Veer Pratap Singh now.

822
01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.816 line:82%
You'll settle down in the city.
Why would you come back to the village?

823
01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:26.902 line:82%
No, Dad.
I'm your son first.

824
01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:29.655 line:82%
Since you've told me about
your dream, I will make it come true.

825
01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:33.326 line:82%
The only difference is, I won't
ride a bicycle, but fly a helicopter.

826
01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:35.202 line:82%
Would that be okay?

827
01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:38.247 line:82%
Hurry up now,
or mom will get angry. Come on.

828
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.124 line:82%
There's one more thing.

829
01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:47.173 line:82%
In my dream,
I saw the girl sitting on the backseat

830
01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.801 line:82%
of your bicycle.

831
01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.605 line:82%
I think you're drunk
early in the morning.

832
01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.149 line:82%
Dad, she's a Pakistani.
A Pakistani.

833
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:08.319 line:82%
She may be a Pakistani,
Chinese or Japanese.

834
01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:10.821 line:82%
I don't care.

835
01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:14.033 line:82%
All I can see

836
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.995 line:82%
is that when this girl sits
behind you on your bicycle

837
01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.623 line:82%
she will place
her hand on your shoulder.

838
01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:24.460 line:82%
She won't let you fall.

839
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.296 line:82%
She will never let
you take the wrong turn.

840
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.883 line:82%
Come here. Sit here. Look.

841
01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:37.306 line:82%
When the right
woman enters a man's life

842
01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.725 line:82%
only then he can live
his life to the fullest.

843
01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:44.188 line:82%
I, Chaudhary Sumer Singh,
am incomplete without your mom.

844
01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:50.027 line:82%
And you,
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh

845
01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:53.364 line:82%
will be incomplete without Zaara.

846
01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:56.784 line:82%
Hence, first understand
what's in your heart

847
01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.203 line:82%
and then,
tell her how you feel.

848
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.707 line:82%
Or else, it'll be too late.
Believe me.

849
01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:08.212 line:82%
-Dad, you know what?
-What?

850
01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:10.256 line:82%
-Your dream...
-Yes.

851
01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:12.710 line:82%
Would it do if my wife sat
in front of me on the bicycle?

852
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:13.806 line:82%
Absolutely.

853
01:15:13.856 --> 01:15:15.511 line:82%
-Should I talk to her?
-No, I will.

854
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.513 line:82%
-Let me talk.
-I'll talk to her.

855
01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.223 line:82%
-She'll listen to me.
-How does that matter?

856
01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.641 line:82%
-I'll talk to her.
-Let me...

857
01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.852 line:82%
-Do you have to marry her or do I?
-It's the same thing.

858
01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.979 line:82%
-How can it be the same thing?
-Listen... Hey!

859
01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:27.064 line:82%
Stop! Listen...

860
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:41.787 line:82%
-Bye, Aunt.
-What? You're leaving?

861
01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:46.125 line:82%
I'll allow you to leave
only if you promise to return.

862
01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:49.670 line:82%
I promise, I'll return.

863
01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:52.757 line:82%
But you'll have to give me
one more approval in return.

864
01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:54.258 line:82%
For what?

865
01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:58.971 line:82%
Can I call you mom?

866
01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:19.200 line:82%
I think we should get going.

867
01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.326 line:82%
We'll be late.

868
01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:23.412 line:82%
I'm completely ready.
I'll get my bag.

869
01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:27.958 line:82%
-Are you leaving?
-Yes, Mom.

870
01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:32.296 line:82%
You ordered me to be here
anyhow on Lohri, and I did come.

871
01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:34.924 line:82%
I could get only two days off.

872
01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.884 line:82%
I have to report
to headquarters this evening.

873
01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:39.428 line:82%
I'll get Zaara on a bus to Amritsar
and leave from there.

874
01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:40.756 line:82%
Absolutely not.

875
01:16:40.863 --> 01:16:44.016 line:82%
Drop Zaara to the Atari station
and only then can you leave.

876
01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.352 line:82%
She's alone.
What if something untoward happens?

877
01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:49.980 line:82%
Wow! She has become
very dear to you in just a day.

878
01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.900 line:82%
You'd sulk every time I left.

879
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.028 line:82%
You'd try stopping me,
and today you're asking me to hurry up.

880
01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:59.365 line:82%
Go away! I don't wish to hear
your nonsense.

881
01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:02.910 line:82%
I've made gram flour sweets
for Ranjit and you. Take them.

882
01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:12.086 line:82%
What are you doing?
Veer is getting late.

883
01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.797 line:82%
-I was getting oil refilled in it.
-Is this the time to do that?

884
01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:16.215 line:82%
It's okay, Dad.

885
01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:18.926 line:82%
-Greetings!
-It's okay...

886
01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:23.180 line:82%
Bless you!
Do tell her.

887
01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:25.933 line:82%
-I will. Don't pressurize me.
-Should I...

888
01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.435 line:82%
-Mom, control him.
-Where do you think you're going?

889
01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:29.562 line:82%
What's in this?

890
01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:32.648 line:82%
-It's not for you.
-It's not for me... Oh, I see.

891
01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:33.816 line:82%
Your son is leaving. So, for him...

892
01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.234 line:82%
-Sir.
-Yes?

893
01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:39.113 line:82%
Hey! What are you doing, dear?

894
01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:40.990 line:82%
We don't allow girls
to touch our feet here.

895
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:44.869 line:82%
But girls seek
blessings before they leave.

896
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:49.081 line:82%
Bless you.

897
01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:55.838 line:82%
Dear, give your parents my message.

898
01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:01.427 line:82%
Tell them that a 60-year-old Indian

899
01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:05.347 line:82%
saluted the values that
they've instilled in their daughter.

900
01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.130 line:82%
-How long is it going to take?
-Around half an hour.

901
01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.466 line:82%
Take care of each other, Mom and Dad!

902
01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:44.136 line:82%
I'll tell her.

903
01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:53.437 line:82%
What do you think?
Will Veer tell her?

904
01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:57.566 line:82%
He's my son.
Why wouldn't he tell her? He will.

905
01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:01.195 line:82%
-Didn't I tell you?
-Come on! You're too much.

906
01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.739 line:82%
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Listen...

907
01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:16.543 line:82%
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
thank you very much.

908
01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.136 line:82%
For what?

909
01:19:18.716 --> 01:19:24.176 line:82%
In just a day, you've given me
such precious memories

910
01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.553 line:82%
and relationships that
I´ll cherish for a lifetime.

911
01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:30.265 line:82%
Well, an Indian had
made a promise to a Pakistani.

912
01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:34.269 line:82%
If I hadn't fulfilled it, it would have
tarnished the reputation of my country.

913
01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:40.526 line:82%
I think it was God's excuse
to make me bring grandma's ashes here.

914
01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:43.153 line:82%
I was destined to meet you all.

915
01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:46.532 line:82%
Do you believe in destiny?

916
01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:49.410 line:82%
Of course. Don't you?

917
01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:54.581 line:82%
I didn't before, but now I do.

918
01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:04.508 line:82%
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

919
01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.555 line:82%
Careful. Come.

920
01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:12.516 line:82%
-Oh, my!
-Hey!

921
01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:19.356 line:82%
You're not all right. You're hurt.
You should rest here for a while.

922
01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:22.359 line:82%
-No, I'll miss my train.
-You won't...

923
01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:28.240 line:82%
You won't miss your train.
I'll support you. Put your hand here.

924
01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:33.954 line:82%
Your... Your anklet.

925
01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:38.459 line:82%
Let me keep it.
I'll give it to you later.

926
01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:41.420 line:82%
Come. Hold onto me.

927
01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:51.263 line:82%
How many times
are you going to save my life?

928
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.267 line:82%
Stop risking your life, then.

929
01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:43.023 line:82%
Actually,
seats are not readily available.

930
01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:45.901 line:82%
Eid is approaching. A lot of people
cross the border during this period.

931
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.695 line:82%
But don't worry.
I'll do something.

932
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.433 line:82%
Great! I'm glad you're all right.

933
01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:21.019 line:82%
I just got off the train from Lahore.

934
01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:24.189 line:82%
I was trying to understand
the routes, and I spotted you.

935
01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:27.484 line:82%
Your dad is back home.

936
01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:30.612 line:82%
He has sent me. Let's go.

937
01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.156 line:82%
Let's call everyone
so that they're relieved.

938
01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:34.449 line:82%
Then we'll make arrangements to return.

939
01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:38.954 line:82%
Well, who are you?

940
01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:43.125 line:82%
Oh! This is Veer.
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

941
01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:45.961 line:82%
I've been able
to come this far because of him.

942
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.839 line:82%
And this is Raza.
Raza Sharazi, my fiancé.

943
01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:07.524 line:82%
Come.

944
01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.491 line:82%
Passengers traveling to Lahore

945
01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:19.828 line:82%
are requested to check their
belongings before boarding the train.

946
01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.998 line:82%
We wish you a pleasant journey.
Thank you.

947
01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:26.919 line:82%
We've got the seats.
We'll leave now.

948
01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:32.841 line:82%
I'm so silly.
We spent so much time together

949
01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.260 line:82%
but I completely forgot
to tell you about Raza.

950
01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:39.139 line:82%
-You certainly made a big mistake.
-What?

951
01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:45.229 line:82%
You made a big mistake.

952
01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:55.530 line:82%
Zaara, I'm a very simple man.

953
01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.534 line:82%
I don't beat around the bush.

954
01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:00.118 line:82%
I get to the point.

955
01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:04.289 line:82%
For the first time,
because of mom and dad

956
01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:05.749 line:82%
I started thinking otherwise.

957
01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:12.464 line:82%
Throughout the journey, I kept
thinking of ways to make you stay back.

958
01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.925 line:82%
I wanted to tell you

959
01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:16.635 line:82%
that I really like you.

960
01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:22.432 line:82%
And if you like me too

961
01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:24.059 line:82%
then we could get married.

962
01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:29.815 line:82%
We'd spend our lives happily,
like we did in the last two days.

963
01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.361 line:82%
But God's ways are strange.

964
01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:36.738 line:82%
He kept encouraging me

965
01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:40.575 line:82%
but as soon as we got here

966
01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.411 line:82%
there was a twist in the tale.

967
01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:53.213 line:82%
You must be wondering
why I'm saying all this to you now.

968
01:24:53.213 --> 01:24:55.882 line:82%
Please, don't misunderstand me.

969
01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.971 line:82%
I know that you belong
to someone else.

970
01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:05.309 line:82%
There is no such relationship between us

971
01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.770 line:82%
nor can there ever be.

972
01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:14.401 line:82%
But at any point in time

973
01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:17.237 line:82%
if you ever need a friend

974
01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:20.032 line:82%
do remember me.

975
01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:22.993 line:82%
Across the border,
there is someone

976
01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:25.120 line:82%
who is willing
to sacrifice his life for you.

977
01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:35.589 line:82%
Come on, Zaara.
We must leave.

978
01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:37.049 line:82%
Mr. Veer.

979
01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:41.762 line:82%
Zaara mentioned
how you saved her life.

980
01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:44.056 line:82%
I'm indebted to you.

981
01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:47.351 line:82%
Tell me, how can I repay the favor?

982
01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:50.062 line:82%
Just keep Zaara happy forever.

983
01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.355 line:82%
That'll repay the favor.

984
01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:54.566 line:82%
Control yourself, Mr. Veer.

985
01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:57.486 line:82%
Why do I feel like
you're in love with Zaara?

986
01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:03.075 line:82%
I don't know what love is.

987
01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:07.565 line:82%
But I do pray

988
01:26:09.503 --> 01:26:13.212 line:82%
that Zaara never has to cry.
That she keeps smiling always.

989
01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:17.422 line:82%
If you call this love

990
01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.050 line:82%
so be it.

991
01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:23.887 line:82%
Mr. Veer...

992
01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:28.642 line:82%
I hope you know that
you're talking about my fiancée.

993
01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:32.771 line:82%
I don't understand

994
01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:35.690 line:82%
whether I should take
this as a compliment or an insult.

995
01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:39.569 line:82%
Don't think of this as anything.

996
01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:42.656 line:82%
Because the truth is,

997
01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:44.324 line:82%
I'm no one to her.

998
01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:47.994 line:82%
And you mean the world to her.

999
01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:57.879 line:82%
Goodbye. Shall we?

1000
01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:36.251 line:82%
My dreams lasted a few moments

1001
01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:42.424 line:82%
And then, we went our separate ways

1002
01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:47.679 line:82%
This love story lasted a few moments

1003
01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:53.351 line:82%
And then, we went our separate ways

1004
01:27:53.351 --> 01:28:00.066 line:82%
And then, we went our separate ways

1005
01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:24.799 line:82%
When you were with me,
my life seemed bright

1006
01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:30.055 line:82%
When you were with me,
the flowers blossomed

1007
01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:36.186 line:82%
When you were with me,
my dreams seemed real

1008
01:28:36.186 --> 01:28:42.442 line:82%
When you were with me,
I was happy

1009
01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:47.572 line:82%
When you were with me,
the flowers bloomed

1010
01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:53.828 line:82%
When you were with me,
my world seemed different

1011
01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:59.209 line:82%
My dreams lasted a few moments

1012
01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:05.340 line:82%
And then, we went our separate ways

1013
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:10.554 line:82%
The love story lasted a few moments

1014
01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:17.102 line:82%
And then, we went our separate ways.

1015
01:29:28.238 --> 01:29:30.782 line:82%
Hey, 786!

1016
01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:35.912 line:82%
Dinner time.

1017
01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:41.876 line:82%
And ma'am, your visiting time is up.

1018
01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:44.087 line:82%
You must leave now.

1019
01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:56.975 line:82%
I'll be back tomorrow.

1020
01:29:57.809 --> 01:30:01.771 line:82%
I'm sorry.
Your story is left incomplete.

1021
01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:03.523 line:82%
Let's go, ma'am.

1022
01:30:15.619 --> 01:30:19.414 line:82%
Hey, 786! I'll send someone
to get the plate in 10 minutes.

1023
01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:23.168 line:82%
Eat quickly, or you'll have to sleep on
an empty stomach again.

1024
01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:27.088 line:82%
Have you ever thought about

1025
01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:31.092 line:82%
-why his number is 786?
-What?

1026
01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:34.971 line:82%
Have you ever noticed

1027
01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.266 line:82%
why, among thousands of prisoners

1028
01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:41.936 line:82%
this auspicious number

1029
01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:44.272 line:82%
was assigned to a Hindu prisoner?

1030
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:50.695 line:82%
This can't be a mere coincidence.

1031
01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:53.615 line:82%
This is the miracle of God.

1032
01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:56.576 line:82%
It's His way of telling you all

1033
01:30:56.576 --> 01:31:00.080 line:82%
that he's a man of God.

1034
01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:03.124 line:82%
Respect him.

1035
01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:07.879 line:82%
So, before you
misbehave with him the next time

1036
01:31:07.879 --> 01:31:09.923 line:82%
do think about what I said.

1037
01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:07.689 line:82%
Gram flour sweets.
Mom has sent these for you.

1038
01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:13.737 line:82%
Please have some.
Mom has sent these with a lot of love.

1039
01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:29.169 line:82%
What happened? Didn't you like it?

1040
01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:30.545 line:82%
No...

1041
01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:35.300 line:82%
These are just like

1042
01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.845 line:82%
the ones that my mom used to make.

1043
01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:43.892 line:82%
Everything that
mothers make tastes similar.

1044
01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:48.688 line:82%
Can I have one more?

1045
01:32:48.688 --> 01:32:51.858 line:82%
-Sure! It's all for you.
-Samya...

1046
01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:57.572 line:82%
Tell your mom...

1047
01:32:57.572 --> 01:33:00.408 line:82%
that she gave me my childhood back

1048
01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:04.829 line:82%
through this tiny box.
These are delicious.

1049
01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:11.711 line:82%
I told your tale to mom all night.

1050
01:33:12.504 --> 01:33:15.590 line:82%
She cried for a while
and then went to sleep.

1051
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:18.593 line:82%
But I kept waiting for dawn.

1052
01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:23.097 line:82%
I kept wondering what
made you land up here.

1053
01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:29.395 line:82%
I kept wondering how the story
ended at the railway station.

1054
01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:35.985 line:82%
This story couldn't have ended there.

1055
01:33:37.987 --> 01:33:43.117 line:82%
Because this was only
Veer's love story so far.

1056
01:33:45.078 --> 01:33:49.040 line:82%
Zaara's love hadn't even begun.

1057
01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:57.799 line:82%
And without knowing
about Zaara's feelings

1058
01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:01.553 line:82%
Veer's story, and his life

1059
01:34:03.763 --> 01:34:05.640 line:82%
would be incomplete.

1060
01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:13.481 line:82%
Jahangir Hayat Khan
was Zaara's father,

1061
01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:15.525 line:82%
and the pride of Lahore.

1062
01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.863 line:82%
Ever since Pakistan was formed

1063
01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:23.366 line:82%
the Hayat Khan family of Lahore

1064
01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:27.662 line:82%
was recognized as a symbol
of respect, etiquette and honor.

1065
01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:35.295 line:82%
Jahangir Hayat Khan
was stepping into politics.

1066
01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:40.091 line:82%
And the one who was helping
him in it was Abdul Sharazi.

1067
01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:47.056 line:82%
Another well-known
man in Lahore, Abdul Sharazi

1068
01:34:47.056 --> 01:34:49.559 line:82%
was Raza Sharazi's father.

1069
01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:56.774 line:82%
Zaara and Raza's
alliance wasn't ordinary.

1070
01:34:56.774 --> 01:35:00.111 line:82%
The fates of all of them
were connected to it.

1071
01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:05.033 line:82%
In such a situation,
Zaara leaving for India all by herself

1072
01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:08.119 line:82%
was considered an
irresponsible behavior.

1073
01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:10.830 line:82%
And forgiving such behavior

1074
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:14.709 line:82%
was not what
Jahangir Hayat Khan would do.

1075
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:18.338 line:82%
It had been a month
since Zaara returned.

1076
01:35:18.338 --> 01:35:22.258 line:82%
But her father hadn't spoken to her.

1077
01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:25.303 line:82%
Oh, my! This is amazing!

1078
01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.597 line:82%
It's so beautiful!

1079
01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:33.144 line:82%
Look at this one. It's an antique set.
It belongs to Raza's ancestors.

1080
01:35:33.144 --> 01:35:36.648 line:82%
Our Zaara is so fortunate.
Raza has everything one could ask for.

1081
01:35:36.648 --> 01:35:41.611 line:82%
-A well-known family, wealth...
-There's no doubt.

1082
01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:44.530 line:82%
By God's grace,
they have everything.

1083
01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:47.367 line:82%
She couldn't have got a better alliance.

1084
01:35:47.367 --> 01:35:50.536 line:82%
-I just...
-There's someone across the border

1085
01:35:50.536 --> 01:35:52.747 line:82%
who can even sacrifice his life for you.

1086
01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:55.500 line:82%
Mom.

1087
01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:58.586 line:82%
Would you sacrifice your life for dad?

1088
01:36:00.046 --> 01:36:03.549 line:82%
Obviously, he's my husband.
I would do anything for him.

1089
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:07.762 line:82%
Would dad sacrifice his life for you?

1090
01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:09.180 line:82%
What kind of a question is that?!

1091
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.766 line:82%
I pray that never happens!

1092
01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:16.312 line:82%
But if the need arose

1093
01:36:16.312 --> 01:36:20.358 line:82%
are you certain he
would sacrifice his life for you?

1094
01:36:20.358 --> 01:36:22.110 line:82%
Have you lost your mind?

1095
01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:25.029 line:82%
Shabbo, give me a lemon.
My hands are sticky.

1096
01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:29.242 line:82%
That means, you aren't certain,
are you?

1097
01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:38.126 line:82%
Listen, dear,
there's difference between

1098
01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:41.713 line:82%
a woman's love
and a man's love.

1099
01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:48.094 line:82%
A woman sacrifices everything she has
and loves wholeheartedly.

1100
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:52.682 line:82%
Men don't have the power
to love that way.

1101
01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:58.229 line:82%
I know why you're asking me this.

1102
01:36:58.229 --> 01:37:00.815 line:82%
But don't expect this from Raza.

1103
01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:07.196 line:82%
Just fulfill your duties towards him.

1104
01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:12.326 line:82%
I'm certain that he will perform
his duties well, too.

1105
01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:17.081 line:82%
But he won't sacrifice
his life for me, will he?

1106
01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:18.875 line:82%
Stop all this!

1107
01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:21.711 line:82%
Shabbo, you apply this.
This girl will drive me crazy!

1108
01:37:21.711 --> 01:37:26.507 line:82%
There is someone across the border
who would sacrifice his life for you.

1109
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:30.470 line:82%
But Mom, I know a person

1110
01:37:31.262 --> 01:37:33.723 line:82%
who can happily
sacrifice his life for me.

1111
01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:42.315 line:82%
A person who is honest.

1112
01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:45.651 line:82%
Someone who is decent.

1113
01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:48.321 line:82%
A man

1114
01:37:48.905 --> 01:37:53.159 line:82%
who would sacrifice
all he has to love a woman.

1115
01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:58.915 line:82%
A person who doesn't
care that I'm a Pakistani

1116
01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.045 line:82%
and he's Indian.

1117
01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:11.677 line:82%
Who are you talking about?
What did you do there?

1118
01:38:11.677 --> 01:38:14.555 line:82%
Tell the truth. For my sake.

1119
01:38:15.431 --> 01:38:18.559 line:82%
He didn't even touch me, Mom.

1120
01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:21.646 line:82%
But I gave him everything I had.

1121
01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:24.565 line:82%
Don't you know your father?

1122
01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:26.984 line:82%
He's stopped talking to you.

1123
01:38:26.984 --> 01:38:30.279 line:82%
If he finds out
about this, he'll kill you.

1124
01:38:30.279 --> 01:38:32.740 line:82%
Don't you know that
you're getting officially engaged today?

1125
01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:35.201 line:82%
You're about to get married.

1126
01:38:35.201 --> 01:38:38.037 line:82%
Even thinking about
someone else is forbidden now, Zaara.

1127
01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:42.750 line:82%
Silly! Love sounds good in books

1128
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:46.087 line:82%
and poetry, not in real life.

1129
01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:50.424 line:82%
That's what I thought too, Mom.

1130
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.010 line:82%
-Until now...
-Listen.

1131
01:38:55.638 --> 01:38:57.598 line:82%
Shabbo, talk her out of it,

1132
01:38:57.598 --> 01:39:00.476 line:82%
or it'll be a disaster.

1133
01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:07.817 line:82%
Listen to me, Zaara.
You're destined to marry Raza.

1134
01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:12.405 line:82%
You can't change it,
and nor can God.

1135
01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:18.077 line:82%
Zaara, what's this?

1136
01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:21.831 line:82%
It's love, Shabbo.

1137
01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:25.209 line:82%
It just happens.

1138
01:39:29.505 --> 01:39:36.499 line:82%
A cob of millet...
It's easy for me to break it

1139
01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:43.749 line:82%
A cob of millet...
It's easy for me to break it

1140
01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:50.999 line:82%
My beloved is upset...
It's easy for me to pacify him

1141
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:53.654 line:82%
A cob of millet

1142
01:39:58.618 --> 01:40:03.539 line:82%
Have you forgotten the day I was walking
by myself, minding my own business?

1143
01:40:03.539 --> 01:40:07.418 line:82%
You fell for my beauty
and mesmerizing youth

1144
01:40:07.418 --> 01:40:10.004 line:82%
You kept exchanging glances

1145
01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:13.716 line:82%
You kept pleading...

1146
01:40:16.052 --> 01:40:18.012 line:82%
Sit.

1147
01:40:21.557 --> 01:40:24.518 line:82%
You're my only child.

1148
01:40:25.394 --> 01:40:29.815 line:82%
Hence, I've pampered you
and given you freedom.

1149
01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:33.194 line:82%
You've been raised not like a girl,

1150
01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:35.112 line:82%
but like a boy.

1151
01:40:37.573 --> 01:40:41.035 line:82%
Usually, the mother has to explain
to her daughters about her duties.

1152
01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:45.039 line:82%
But since I think of you as my son

1153
01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:48.292 line:82%
I'll explain your duties to you.

1154
01:40:52.797 --> 01:40:54.298 line:82%
You already know that

1155
01:40:54.298 --> 01:40:58.052 line:82%
your grandfather was
a respected politician of this nation.

1156
01:40:59.637 --> 01:41:03.724 line:82%
But he died a few days
before he could attain success.

1157
01:41:05.768 --> 01:41:10.231 line:82%
Since that day, as his heir

1158
01:41:11.107 --> 01:41:15.653 line:82%
I've been trying
to take his party to great heights,

1159
01:41:17.989 --> 01:41:20.408 line:82%
but I've been unsuccessful so far.

1160
01:41:21.409 --> 01:41:23.911 line:82%
But with the help of Raza's father,

1161
01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:26.330 line:82%
I feel I can attain that success.

1162
01:41:28.624 --> 01:41:32.003 line:82%
Soon, you'll get
married into their family.

1163
01:41:33.879 --> 01:41:36.382 line:82%
It's your duty

1164
01:41:37.591 --> 01:41:40.886 line:82%
to understand the importance
of this relationship.

1165
01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:46.100 line:82%
Spread happiness,
whether the times are good or bad.

1166
01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:50.021 line:82%
Strengthen the bond
of every relationship.

1167
01:41:51.022 --> 01:41:55.109 line:82%
And protect the honor
of both families at all costs.

1168
01:41:56.694 --> 01:42:01.532 line:82%
A small mistake or bit of carelessness
from your end could ruin everything.

1169
01:42:04.493 --> 01:42:08.164 line:82%
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say.

1170
01:42:08.164 --> 01:42:09.540 line:82%
Yes.

1171
01:42:10.416 --> 01:42:12.793 line:82%
Is there anything you wish to say?

1172
01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:19.717 line:82%
Come here.

1173
01:42:24.764 --> 01:42:29.143 line:82%
It's been long since I saw
the dimples on my daughter's face.

1174
01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:34.190 line:82%
Have you left them in India?

1175
01:42:36.609 --> 01:42:38.611 line:82%
Now that's like it!

1176
01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:53.376 line:82%
Sweetheart, look!

1177
01:42:53.918 --> 01:42:58.964 line:82%
The distances are over

1178
01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:06.847 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1179
01:43:07.556 --> 01:43:12.770 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1180
01:43:42.842 --> 01:43:48.431 line:82%
Sweetheart, look!
The distances are over

1181
01:43:48.431 --> 01:43:53.978 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1182
01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:59.608 line:82%
Sweetheart, look!
The distances are over

1183
01:43:59.608 --> 01:44:05.281 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1184
01:44:05.281 --> 01:44:10.786 line:82%
There are no borders anymore,
nor any helplessness

1185
01:44:10.786 --> 01:44:16.500 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1186
01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:47.114 line:82%
I'm the secret you can't hide

1187
01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:52.328 line:82%
I'm the style you can never forget

1188
01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:03.797 line:82%
Why are you
surprised to hear my voice?

1189
01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:09.220 line:82%
I'm the voice of your heart

1190
01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:15.059 line:82%
Listen to your heartbeats if you can

1191
01:45:15.059 --> 01:45:20.648 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1192
01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:26.195 line:82%
There are no borders anymore,
nor any helplessness

1193
01:45:26.195 --> 01:45:31.867 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1194
01:46:07.987 --> 01:46:13.659 line:82%
I'm in your thoughts now

1195
01:46:13.659 --> 01:46:19.039 line:82%
I'm in your answers
I'm in your questions

1196
01:46:24.753 --> 01:46:30.426 line:82%
I'm in every dream of yours

1197
01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:35.973 line:82%
I reside in your vision

1198
01:46:35.973 --> 01:46:41.604 line:82%
Wherever you look,
you'll find me

1199
01:46:41.604 --> 01:46:47.401 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1200
01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:52.781 line:82%
Sweetheart, look!
The distances are over

1201
01:46:52.781 --> 01:46:58.495 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1202
01:46:58.495 --> 01:47:04.001 line:82%
There are no borders anymore,
nor any helplessness

1203
01:47:04.001 --> 01:47:10.591 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1204
01:47:25.731 --> 01:47:31.737 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here

1205
01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:38.786 line:82%
I'm here
I'm here.

1206
01:47:38.786 --> 01:47:41.497 line:82%
-Zaara.
-Shabbo.

1207
01:47:42.956 --> 01:47:44.833 line:82%
Tell him to get
away from my sight, Shabbo!

1208
01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:46.877 line:82%
I don't know why
I'm seeing him everywhere.

1209
01:47:47.878 --> 01:47:49.630 line:82%
He's in my soul, Shabbo.

1210
01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:51.006 line:82%
Ask him to leave.

1211
01:47:51.006 --> 01:47:53.801 line:82%
Ask him to leave.
Just tell him to leave.

1212
01:47:54.259 --> 01:47:56.970 line:82%
Shabbo, ask him to leave, please.

1213
01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:58.847 line:82%
Shabbo, please tell him.

1214
01:47:59.348 --> 01:48:01.934 line:82%
Tell him, Shabbo.

1215
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:12.361 line:82%
Yes? Squadron Leader
Veer Pratap Singh.

1216
01:48:12.778 --> 01:48:15.489 line:82%
Hello. Captain Veer Singh.

1217
01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:18.784 line:82%
This is Shabbo.

1218
01:48:19.493 --> 01:48:23.497 line:82%
Shabbo?
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.

1219
01:48:27.501 --> 01:48:30.003 line:82%
I'm calling from Zaara's house.

1220
01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:40.389 line:82%
An unknown girl,
who I never met or saw

1221
01:48:41.557 --> 01:48:44.601 line:82%
gave me the greatest news of my life.

1222
01:48:45.602 --> 01:48:48.230 line:82%
She very easily said

1223
01:48:48.731 --> 01:48:51.108 line:82%
that Zaara loved me.

1224
01:48:51.525 --> 01:48:55.612 line:82%
That she was going to get
married and I should come to Lahore.

1225
01:48:55.612 --> 01:48:57.823 line:82%
She wanted me to take Zaara along,

1226
01:48:57.823 --> 01:49:00.159 line:82%
and she wouldn't be
able to do this by herself.

1227
01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:04.538 line:82%
She told her I could
sacrifice my life for her.

1228
01:49:05.622 --> 01:49:08.167 line:82%
And then,
she asked me one last question.

1229
01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:13.464 line:82%
She asked me how much I loved Zaara.

1230
01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:19.344 line:82%
She asked me how much I loved Zaara.

1231
01:49:21.346 --> 01:49:24.099 line:82%
I didn't have the answer
to this question then.

1232
01:49:25.434 --> 01:49:27.186 line:82%
Nor do I have it now.

1233
01:49:28.771 --> 01:49:31.565 line:82%
I don't know how much

1234
01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:36.904 line:82%
-I love Zaara.
-But I do.

1235
01:49:40.574 --> 01:49:45.287 line:82%
An Indian Air Force pilot
is not permitted to enter Pakistan.

1236
01:49:47.581 --> 01:49:52.336 line:82%
I know that you must have first
resigned on hearing this news.

1237
01:49:54.087 --> 01:49:57.800 line:82%
In spite of knowing that
you will never be able to rejoin.

1238
01:50:00.052 --> 01:50:02.387 line:82%
Then, without telling anyone,

1239
01:50:02.387 --> 01:50:04.139 line:82%
you headed to Lahore.

1240
01:50:05.057 --> 01:50:08.936 line:82%
Without even thinking
about the result of this journey.

1241
01:50:10.979 --> 01:50:13.148 line:82%
Will you get there in time?

1242
01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:16.443 line:82%
Will you be able to meet Zaara?

1243
01:50:17.903 --> 01:50:20.155 line:82%
Will Zaara go with you?

1244
01:50:21.198 --> 01:50:23.700 line:82%
Will you ever be able to return?

1245
01:50:25.661 --> 01:50:27.955 line:82%
You knew nothing.

1246
01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:31.667 line:82%
Yet you left.

1247
01:50:33.335 --> 01:50:36.171 line:82%
Perhaps, you don't know

1248
01:50:36.171 --> 01:50:40.843 line:82%
but I do know how much
you love Zaara.

1249
01:50:41.802 --> 01:50:43.053 line:82%
I know it.

1250
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:11.707 line:82%
Greetings, sir. I'm Shabbo.

1251
01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:14.668 line:82%
Greetings.

1252
01:51:26.305 --> 01:51:30.475 line:82%
I'm sorry, this is the best I could do.

1253
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:39.484 line:82%
Wow! This has a view of the entire city.

1254
01:51:42.154 --> 01:51:45.991 line:82%
I couldn't have found
a better room in the whole of Lahore.

1255
01:51:47.993 --> 01:51:50.829 line:82%
I didn't tell Zaara about your arrival.

1256
01:51:55.125 --> 01:51:58.086 line:82%
She would have been petrified.

1257
01:51:58.086 --> 01:52:00.088 line:82%
She's getting
married the day after tomorrow.

1258
01:52:00.088 --> 01:52:02.341 line:82%
She can't leave her house.

1259
01:52:03.008 --> 01:52:06.595 line:82%
But she'll be going to
the durgah with everyone tomorrow.

1260
01:52:06.595 --> 01:52:09.723 line:82%
This is Munir, my younger brother.

1261
01:52:09.723 --> 01:52:12.643 line:82%
He'll take you to the durgah.

1262
01:52:12.643 --> 01:52:15.187 line:82%
The rest is God's will.

1263
01:52:15.187 --> 01:52:18.732 line:82%
Okay, Munir.
My fate rests in your hands.

1264
01:52:20.359 --> 01:52:23.153 line:82%
Okay, I'll leave.

1265
01:52:23.153 --> 01:52:25.822 line:82%
-What?
-I'll be leaving.

1266
01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:28.825 line:82%
If I go missing for too long,
they'll start interrogating me.

1267
01:52:28.825 --> 01:52:31.662 line:82%
If you need anything,
Munir is here for you.

1268
01:52:34.539 --> 01:52:36.375 line:82%
Thank you, Shabbo.

1269
01:52:38.961 --> 01:52:41.880 line:82%
I never thought that you'd come.

1270
01:52:42.881 --> 01:52:46.802 line:82%
Now that you're here, I'm certain

1271
01:52:47.803 --> 01:52:50.389 line:82%
that you will take Zaara away.

1272
01:52:51.306 --> 01:52:55.143 line:82%
I had to come.
My dad says

1273
01:52:55.143 --> 01:52:58.772 line:82%
that true love
happens only once in life.

1274
01:52:58.772 --> 01:53:01.169 line:82%
And when it does happen

1275
01:53:01.305 --> 01:53:05.278 line:82%
God makes sure you get your love.

1276
01:53:06.655 --> 01:53:09.094 line:82%
We'll find out tomorrow...

1277
01:53:09.209 --> 01:53:13.412 line:82%
if God thinks that my love is true.

1278
01:53:13.412 --> 01:53:19.918 line:82%
I've broken the bonds of the society

1279
01:53:21.128 --> 01:53:24.840 line:82%
I've forsaken the world

1280
01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:30.637 line:82%
for your sake

1281
01:53:32.139 --> 01:53:37.102 line:82%
He's come to you

1282
01:53:37.102 --> 01:53:41.690 line:82%
He's come to you

1283
01:53:41.982 --> 01:53:46.611 line:82%
He's come...
He's crazy about you

1284
01:53:46.611 --> 01:53:50.949 line:82%
He's come to you

1285
01:53:50.949 --> 01:53:55.954 line:82%
He's come to you

1286
01:53:56.621 --> 01:54:00.625 line:82%
He's crazy about you
He's crazy about you

1287
01:54:00.625 --> 01:54:05.172 line:82%
He's come to you

1288
01:54:05.172 --> 01:54:09.843 line:82%
He's come to you

1289
01:54:09.843 --> 01:54:14.306 line:82%
He's yours
He belongs to you

1290
01:54:14.306 --> 01:54:18.977 line:82%
He's yours
He belongs to you

1291
01:54:18.977 --> 01:54:23.857 line:82%
He wants to die in your love

1292
01:54:23.857 --> 01:54:28.111 line:82%
He's come to you

1293
01:54:28.111 --> 01:54:32.866 line:82%
He's come to you

1294
01:54:48.632 --> 01:54:52.886 line:82%
When I see you,
I forget all sorrow

1295
01:54:52.886 --> 01:54:57.891 line:82%
When I see you,
I forget all sorrow

1296
01:54:57.891 --> 01:55:02.521 line:82%
The tears in my eyes

1297
01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:06.775 line:82%
regret the distances,
but I'm here now

1298
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:13.031 line:82%
Have mercy!

1299
01:55:13.657 --> 01:55:19.704 line:82%
Take a look at me once

1300
01:55:19.704 --> 01:55:24.251 line:82%
Have mercy!
Take a look at me once

1301
01:55:24.251 --> 01:55:28.964 line:82%
My life and soul
are dedicated to you

1302
01:55:28.964 --> 01:55:33.510 line:82%
My life and soul
are dedicated to you

1303
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:38.014 line:82%
You're the one
I'm crazy about

1304
01:55:38.014 --> 01:55:42.352 line:82%
He's come to you

1305
01:55:42.352 --> 01:55:47.023 line:82%
He's come to you

1306
01:55:47.023 --> 01:55:51.153 line:82%
He's come...

1307
01:56:01.705 --> 01:56:05.792 line:82%
He's come to you

1308
01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:09.880 line:82%
He's come to you

1309
01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.967 line:82%
He's crazy about you
He's crazy about you

1310
01:56:13.967 --> 01:56:18.096 line:82%
He's crazy about you
He's crazy about you

1311
01:56:18.096 --> 01:56:21.558 line:82%
He's crazy about you

1312
01:56:26.313 --> 01:56:32.611 line:82%
He's crazy about you
He's crazy about you

1313
01:56:32.611 --> 01:56:36.281 line:82%
He's come to you

1314
01:56:36.698 --> 01:56:40.452 line:82%
What has this story come to?

1315
01:56:40.452 --> 01:56:44.789 line:82%
What has this story come to?

1316
01:56:44.789 --> 01:56:48.877 line:82%
He wants to die in your love

1317
01:56:48.877 --> 01:56:52.756 line:82%
What has this story come to?

1318
01:56:52.756 --> 01:56:57.010 line:82%
What has this story come to?

1319
01:56:57.010 --> 01:57:01.014 line:82%
What has this story come to?

1320
01:57:01.014 --> 01:57:06.311 line:82%
What has this story come to?

1321
01:57:25.038 --> 01:57:27.374 line:82%
He's conscious,
but doesn't want to come to his senses.

1322
01:57:28.375 --> 01:57:31.294 line:82%
He can hear everything,
but doesn't wish to listen.

1323
01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:35.382 line:82%
He's in trauma.

1324
01:57:35.382 --> 01:57:39.427 line:82%
As if he were punishing himself.

1325
01:57:42.055 --> 01:57:44.724 line:82%
The next 24 hours are critical.

1326
01:57:45.308 --> 01:57:48.228 line:82%
He may not be able
to take another shock.

1327
01:57:50.272 --> 01:57:54.401 line:82%
The nurse is here.
I'll keep visiting every four hours.

1328
01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:58.071 line:82%
Thank you.

1329
01:58:07.122 --> 01:58:09.457 line:82%
Don't worry.

1330
01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:11.960 line:82%
They were our own people.

1331
01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.630 line:82%
Thank God, this news hasn't spread.

1332
01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:19.968 line:82%
After the wedding tomorrow,
everyone will shut their mouths.

1333
01:58:19.968 --> 01:58:22.429 line:82%
After all that's happened

1334
01:58:22.429 --> 01:58:24.806 line:82%
Raza is still willing to marry her?

1335
01:58:24.806 --> 01:58:28.393 line:82%
Well, this isn't just
Raza and Zaara's wedding.

1336
01:58:29.477 --> 01:58:33.815 line:82%
There's a deep and strong compromise
that lies behind it.

1337
01:58:33.815 --> 01:58:36.568 line:82%
On its foundation,
your husband's

1338
01:58:36.985 --> 01:58:40.363 line:82%
and after him,
my son Raza's career rests.

1339
01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.118 line:82%
Raza understands this.

1340
01:58:45.118 --> 01:58:49.622 line:82%
Now Zaara must understand the same.

1341
01:58:49.622 --> 01:58:52.542 line:82%
If the wedding doesn't
take place tomorrow

1342
01:58:52.542 --> 01:58:57.756 line:82%
then Jahangir Hayat Khan's daughter

1343
01:58:57.756 --> 01:59:00.425 line:82%
will marry an Indian boy.

1344
01:59:01.468 --> 01:59:04.763 line:82%
Mr. Khan's efforts of
all these years will be ruined.

1345
01:59:04.763 --> 01:59:06.973 line:82%
He will not only
lose in the elections.

1346
01:59:07.891 --> 01:59:10.769 line:82%
but also face humiliation
for the rest of his life.

1347
01:59:12.145 --> 01:59:16.900 line:82%
Mr. Khan won't be able to endure

1348
01:59:18.276 --> 01:59:20.528 line:82%
such humiliation.

1349
01:59:21.363 --> 01:59:23.073 line:82%
He won't be able to take it.

1350
01:59:31.915 --> 01:59:34.751 line:82%
Come with the wedding
procession tomorrow, Mr. Abdul.

1351
01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:40.256 line:82%
There will be a wedding in
this house tomorrow. I promise you.

1352
01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:56.439 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-To Zaara's house.

1353
01:59:57.649 --> 02:00:01.111 line:82%
Please don't go now.
Let the night pass.

1354
02:00:01.111 --> 02:00:05.949 line:82%
Raza has been looking for you.
There's silence in the house.

1355
02:00:05.949 --> 02:00:08.284 line:82%
You can't do anything there.

1356
02:00:08.284 --> 02:00:12.330 line:82%
-Her father's in trauma.
-And I'm the reason for it.

1357
02:00:12.330 --> 02:00:13.915 line:82%
Only I can cure him.

1358
02:00:15.542 --> 02:00:18.586 line:82%
I didn't come here
to just look at Zaara.

1359
02:00:19.838 --> 02:00:23.758 line:82%
When everyone's quiet,
there has to be silence.

1360
02:00:25.427 --> 02:00:27.887 line:82%
Someone has to utter the first word.

1361
02:00:29.681 --> 02:00:32.851 line:82%
I don't care what the result is.

1362
02:01:33.745 --> 02:01:37.373 line:82%
My name is Mariam Hayat Khan.

1363
02:01:38.875 --> 02:01:41.336 line:82%
I'm Zaara's mother.

1364
02:01:41.878 --> 02:01:47.050 line:82%
Perhaps, I've lost the right
to call her my own today.

1365
02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:51.930 line:82%
Because my daughter
is not mine anymore.

1366
02:01:52.597 --> 02:01:56.142 line:82%
She belongs to you.

1367
02:02:00.188 --> 02:02:02.815 line:82%
I've come to ask
for my daughter back.

1368
02:02:04.108 --> 02:02:07.028 line:82%
Give me my daughter back.

1369
02:02:08.029 --> 02:02:10.573 line:82%
Or else, her father will die.

1370
02:02:15.537 --> 02:02:18.373 line:82%
He won't be able
to take the humiliation.

1371
02:02:19.499 --> 02:02:21.417 line:82%
He'll die.

1372
02:02:24.128 --> 02:02:28.508 line:82%
I've heard that you save people's lives.

1373
02:02:31.052 --> 02:02:33.846 line:82%
You saved Zaara's life too.

1374
02:02:35.848 --> 02:02:40.395 line:82%
So, please save her father's life today.

1375
02:02:43.147 --> 02:02:46.901 line:82%
I beg of you.

1376
02:02:46.901 --> 02:02:49.070 line:82%
Please save his life.

1377
02:02:51.364 --> 02:02:54.242 line:82%
He'll die.

1378
02:02:55.618 --> 02:02:59.247 line:82%
He'll die.

1379
02:03:01.457 --> 02:03:05.128 line:82%
A mother shouldn't
beg to her child.

1380
02:03:05.128 --> 02:03:06.921 line:82%
She should order him.

1381
02:03:10.675 --> 02:03:14.887 line:82%
Zaara belongs to you.
She'll always be yours.

1382
02:03:19.142 --> 02:03:24.188 line:82%
Do you think I'd take your
Zaara along without your permission?

1383
02:03:28.192 --> 02:03:31.904 line:82%
People say that love is blind.

1384
02:03:33.406 --> 02:03:37.118 line:82%
So, even we couldn't
See anything in love.

1385
02:03:38.494 --> 02:03:40.830 line:82%
We only saw each other.

1386
02:03:41.331 --> 02:03:44.459 line:82%
We didn't even see
if someone was harmed.

1387
02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:48.254 line:82%
We didn't see if someone was hurt.

1388
02:03:49.631 --> 02:03:51.966 line:82%
Or if someone was dying.

1389
02:03:53.718 --> 02:03:56.054 line:82%
We saw nothing.

1390
02:03:57.930 --> 02:04:00.850 line:82%
But now, everything is clear.

1391
02:04:01.351 --> 02:04:05.772 line:82%
Love can't be
greater than a person's life.

1392
02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:13.905 line:82%
Don't worry.
Zaara will marry...

1393
02:04:14.906 --> 02:04:18.493 line:82%
the one that her father
and mother have chosen for her.

1394
02:04:20.286 --> 02:04:24.165 line:82%
Make arrangements for the wedding.
I'll talk to Zaara.

1395
02:04:28.294 --> 02:04:30.463 line:82%
And I promise

1396
02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:35.301 line:82%
Zaara will accept
the wedding with a smile.

1397
02:04:44.394 --> 02:04:48.648 line:82%
Is every son in your
country just like you?

1398
02:04:52.193 --> 02:04:54.237 line:82%
I don't know that.

1399
02:04:55.029 --> 02:04:58.991 line:82%
But what I do know is
that every mother in my country

1400
02:04:59.909 --> 02:05:01.953 line:82%
is just like you.

1401
02:05:59.886 --> 02:06:03.848 line:82%
If you feel that my decision is wrong

1402
02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.976 line:82%
then give me a sign.

1403
02:06:07.977 --> 02:06:10.354 line:82%
No one can stop me
from taking you to India.

1404
02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:22.241 line:82%
Your decision is right.

1405
02:06:22.241 --> 02:06:26.954 line:82%
This has happened
because of my carelessness.

1406
02:06:26.954 --> 02:06:32.043 line:82%
I had promised myself
not to get shattered.

1407
02:06:32.043 --> 02:06:34.587 line:82%
If I had controlled
myself on seeing you...

1408
02:06:34.587 --> 02:06:35.922 line:82%
That...

1409
02:06:37.507 --> 02:06:41.886 line:82%
That one carelessness is enough
for me to live the rest of my life.

1410
02:06:44.806 --> 02:06:48.893 line:82%
If you had taken that away from me

1411
02:06:48.893 --> 02:06:51.729 line:82%
then what would I have returned with?

1412
02:06:54.941 --> 02:07:00.071 line:82%
Why is God doing this?
I've never done anything wrong.

1413
02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:04.158 line:82%
Then what am I being punished for?

1414
02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:15.670 line:82%
I've grabbed a few moments

1415
02:07:15.670 --> 02:07:18.047 line:82%
of your life.

1416
02:07:20.633 --> 02:07:23.970 line:82%
And I've given you
a few moments of mine.

1417
02:07:25.805 --> 02:07:28.558 line:82%
Now these moments
are our mementos

1418
02:07:29.517 --> 02:07:32.478 line:82%
and our love story.

1419
02:07:35.481 --> 02:07:38.860 line:82%
We'll live the rest of
our lives with these moments.

1420
02:07:42.488 --> 02:07:46.325 line:82%
But, with a smile.

1421
02:07:47.201 --> 02:07:49.412 line:82%
Happily.

1422
02:07:52.039 --> 02:07:55.001 line:82%
We'll still love each other.

1423
02:07:57.795 --> 02:08:00.673 line:82%
But we will fulfill all our duties.

1424
02:08:06.095 --> 02:08:11.350 line:82%
You'll be a good wife and
maintain the honor of your parents

1425
02:08:13.185 --> 02:08:18.149 line:82%
and I will fulfill my
father's dreams in my village.

1426
02:08:22.778 --> 02:08:26.782 line:82%
The day you become
a mother of ten babies

1427
02:08:26.782 --> 02:08:31.579 line:82%
bring them all, over there.

1428
02:08:33.122 --> 02:08:35.791 line:82%
I'll make you sit on my bicycle

1429
02:08:37.293 --> 02:08:40.588 line:82%
and show you around a new village.

1430
02:08:42.089 --> 02:08:46.177 line:82%
But if I have ten babies,

1431
02:08:46.469 --> 02:08:48.638 line:82%
I won't be able to sit on the bicycle.

1432
02:08:51.599 --> 02:08:54.018 line:82%
That's true.

1433
02:08:54.018 --> 02:08:55.603 line:82%
I'll...

1434
02:08:55.603 --> 02:08:59.815 line:82%
...arrange for a tractor, then.

1435
02:09:35.101 --> 02:09:40.314 line:82%
When you were around,
the breeze seemed fragrant

1436
02:09:40.314 --> 02:09:46.445 line:82%
When you were around,
the directions seemed meaningful

1437
02:09:46.445 --> 02:09:51.784 line:82%
When you were around, there was light

1438
02:09:51.784 --> 02:09:57.665 line:82%
When you were around,
the atmosphere seemed lively

1439
02:09:57.999 --> 02:10:03.254 line:82%
When I met you,
I felt like I found my destination

1440
02:10:03.254 --> 02:10:09.385 line:82%
When you were around,
everything seemed magical

1441
02:10:09.385 --> 02:10:14.724 line:82%
My dreams lasted a few moments

1442
02:10:14.724 --> 02:10:20.813 line:82%
and then, we went our separate ways

1443
02:10:20.813 --> 02:10:26.152 line:82%
This love story lasted a few moments

1444
02:10:26.152 --> 02:10:31.741 line:82%
and then, we went our separate ways

1445
02:10:31.741 --> 02:10:37.455 line:82%
And then, we went our separate ways

1446
02:10:37.455 --> 02:10:43.753 line:82%
And then, we went our separate ways.

1447
02:11:22.416 --> 02:11:24.794 line:82%
It's my wedding day, Dad.

1448
02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:29.924 line:82%
Won't you bid me farewell?

1449
02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:34.512 line:82%
Won't you give me your blessings?

1450
02:11:44.647 --> 02:11:48.317 line:82%
Forgive me, dear.

1451
02:11:49.235 --> 02:11:52.488 line:82%
I don't know whether
this is my helplessness

1452
02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.326 line:82%
or my weakness.

1453
02:12:00.454 --> 02:12:03.457 line:82%
Forgive me.

1454
02:12:22.726 --> 02:12:26.105 line:82%
This is the holy thread.

1455
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:29.608 line:82%
It'll protect you.

1456
02:12:30.401 --> 02:12:34.989 line:82%
As soon as you cross
the border, take it off

1457
02:12:34.989 --> 02:12:38.617 line:82%
and offer the money
tied in it to a needy person.

1458
02:12:47.042 --> 02:12:50.796 line:82%
My religion doesn't permit me to do this.

1459
02:12:50.796 --> 02:12:56.135 line:82%
Still, I'll pray to God every day

1460
02:12:56.135 --> 02:12:59.763 line:82%
so that you can have
Zaara in all your lives.

1461
02:13:22.536 --> 02:13:24.330 line:82%
I'm leaving.

1462
02:13:49.271 --> 02:13:50.397 line:82%
Excuse me.

1463
02:13:54.485 --> 02:13:56.445 line:82%
Please sign here.

1464
02:13:58.030 --> 02:14:00.199 line:82%
-What's this?
-Over here.

1465
02:14:02.201 --> 02:14:05.913 line:82%
It says my name is Rajesh Rathore.

1466
02:14:05.913 --> 02:14:10.751 line:82%
That I work for the Indian Intelligence,
RAW. Critical, political, secrecy...

1467
02:14:10.751 --> 02:14:13.128 line:82%
I send Pakistan's
secret information to India.

1468
02:14:13.128 --> 02:14:15.047 line:82%
-That's correct.
-No.

1469
02:14:15.547 --> 02:14:17.800 line:82%
My name is Veer Pratap Singh,
ex-Indian Air Force.

1470
02:14:18.592 --> 02:14:22.846 line:82%
I came here two days ago
to meet someone. I'm going back now.

1471
02:14:22.846 --> 02:14:24.932 line:82%
My bag contains
my passport. You can check it.

1472
02:14:24.932 --> 02:14:26.433 line:82%
We found this in your bag.

1473
02:14:26.892 --> 02:14:30.145 line:82%
Your name is clearly written here.
It's Rajesh Rathore.

1474
02:14:30.145 --> 02:14:31.355 line:82%
Let me see it...

1475
02:14:31.355 --> 02:14:33.649 line:82%
We have witnesses
who can identify you.

1476
02:14:35.818 --> 02:14:37.736 line:82%
What's going on here?

1477
02:14:37.736 --> 02:14:39.154 line:82%
Why are you doing this?

1478
02:14:39.154 --> 02:14:42.491 line:82%
You just said that you
came here to meet someone.

1479
02:14:42.491 --> 02:14:45.202 line:82%
Tell us their name.
We'll call them here.

1480
02:14:45.202 --> 02:14:47.997 line:82%
Sure. I...

1481
02:14:50.416 --> 02:14:54.211 line:82%
-I...
-Go ahead.

1482
02:14:57.715 --> 02:15:01.677 line:82%
-I didn't come to meet anyone.
-Wow! Your love is commendable.

1483
02:15:01.677 --> 02:15:04.972 line:82%
If you say her name,
she'll be disgraced.

1484
02:15:12.187 --> 02:15:14.815 line:82%
You prefer getting into trouble instead.

1485
02:15:14.815 --> 02:15:18.986 line:82%
But you can never
let your love be disgraced.

1486
02:15:18.986 --> 02:15:24.096 line:82%
Wow, Mr. Veer!
I expected the same from you.

1487
02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:31.123 line:82%
Mr. Veer, there's something
special about our countries.

1488
02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.339 line:82%
A person can do anything
if he has the power and money.

1489
02:15:43.594 --> 02:15:47.890 line:82%
What did you think?
That you could just walk in here

1490
02:15:47.890 --> 02:15:52.978 line:82%
and confess your love
to my wife to-be in public

1491
02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:55.397 line:82%
and return, and I...

1492
02:15:56.815 --> 02:15:59.943 line:82%
I'd be a silent spectator!

1493
02:16:03.197 --> 02:16:05.449 line:82%
Mr. Veer.

1494
02:16:05.449 --> 02:16:09.161 line:82%
I'm about to spend
the rest of my life with a girl

1495
02:16:10.496 --> 02:16:12.915 line:82%
who is in love with someone else.

1496
02:16:14.041 --> 02:16:18.670 line:82%
And unfortunately,
I cannot back off now.

1497
02:16:21.590 --> 02:16:23.384 line:82%
Think about it.

1498
02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:29.056 line:82%
Think about...

1499
02:16:29.056 --> 02:16:32.726 line:82%
how much I'll have to suffer
for the rest of my life.

1500
02:16:35.604 --> 02:16:38.440 line:82%
Zaara and you loved each other,

1501
02:16:41.193 --> 02:16:43.821 line:82%
but I'll have to pay for it.

1502
02:16:50.202 --> 02:16:54.081 line:82%
Either you will pay for it

1503
02:16:55.374 --> 02:16:58.752 line:82%
or Zaara will pay for it.

1504
02:16:58.752 --> 02:17:00.504 line:82%
I won't.

1505
02:17:07.219 --> 02:17:10.097 line:82%
You're very proud of your love,
aren't you?

1506
02:17:11.515 --> 02:17:14.643 line:82%
This is a test of your love.

1507
02:17:15.769 --> 02:17:19.690 line:82%
Whether I turn Zaara's life
into paradise or a living hell

1508
02:17:20.774 --> 02:17:23.026 line:82%
depends on you.

1509
02:17:24.486 --> 02:17:29.366 line:82%
Until you're silently
confined behind bars

1510
02:17:31.076 --> 02:17:35.289 line:82%
Zaara's life will be even
more beautiful than paradise.

1511
02:17:37.458 --> 02:17:39.877 line:82%
As soon as you open your mouth

1512
02:17:39.877 --> 02:17:44.089 line:82%
Zaara's life will
turn into a living hell.

1513
02:17:47.968 --> 02:17:51.305 line:82%
Veer Pratap Singh's identity
has to be erased

1514
02:17:51.555 --> 02:17:54.975 line:82%
so that Zaara Hayat Khan
can have a better life.

1515
02:18:03.442 --> 02:18:07.321 line:82%
Now this is a true test of love.

1516
02:18:10.657 --> 02:18:12.618 line:82%
I'll make a move.

1517
02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:18.081 line:82%
It's time for the wedding.

1518
02:18:18.916 --> 02:18:22.669 line:82%
Either choose freedom at the cost
of the honor of Zaara and her family

1519
02:18:23.337 --> 02:18:27.549 line:82%
or sign on that document and
give Zaara a life full of happiness.

1520
02:18:29.510 --> 02:18:31.970 line:82%
The decision is yours.

1521
02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:34.515 line:82%
Good bye.

1522
02:18:46.735 --> 02:18:53.687 line:82%
Why is cruelty a certainty?

1523
02:18:55.202 --> 02:19:02.084 line:82%
Why is the society like that?

1524
02:19:02.084 --> 02:19:06.004 line:82%
These are the norms of the world

1525
02:19:06.004 --> 02:19:10.259 line:82%
I have no control of them now

1526
02:19:10.259 --> 02:19:14.555 line:82%
I don't know why
I was destined with sorrow

1527
02:19:14.555 --> 02:19:18.892 line:82%
I wonder why love is considered a crime

1528
02:19:18.892 --> 02:19:21.144 line:82%
Why does anyone have to cry?

1529
02:19:21.144 --> 02:19:23.355 line:82%
Why does this happen?

1530
02:19:23.355 --> 02:19:25.274 line:82%
Why does anyone have to cry?

1531
02:19:25.274 --> 02:19:27.401 line:82%
Why does this happen?

1532
02:19:27.401 --> 02:19:31.822 line:82%
Why is everyone unaware
of the feeling of love?

1533
02:19:31.822 --> 02:19:38.773 line:82%
What has the story come to?
What has the story come to?

1534
02:19:39.371 --> 02:19:43.709 line:82%
What kind of an atmosphere is there?
There is joy, yet there is sorrow

1535
02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:47.921 line:82%
What kind of an atmosphere is this?
There is joy, yet there is sorrow

1536
02:19:47.921 --> 02:19:52.050 line:82%
Who is my own,
and who is a stranger here?

1537
02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:58.912 line:82%
What has the story come to?
What has the story come to?

1538
02:20:03.478 --> 02:20:08.108 line:82%
Ms. Zaara Hayat Khan,
daughter of Jahangir Hayat Khan

1539
02:20:08.108 --> 02:20:11.069 line:82%
your alliance is
fixed with Raza Sharazi,

1540
02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:14.448 line:82%
son of Abdul Malik Sharazi

1541
02:20:14.448 --> 02:20:20.829 line:82%
at a dowry of five million rupees.

1542
02:20:20.829 --> 02:20:22.998 line:82%
Do you accept this marriage?

1543
02:20:22.998 --> 02:20:29.879 line:82%
What has my story come to?
What has my story come to?

1544
02:20:31.632 --> 02:20:34.635 line:82%
Do you accept that your
name is Rajesh Rathore or not?!

1545
02:20:35.177 --> 02:20:41.350 line:82%
My story... My story...

1546
02:20:41.350 --> 02:20:44.311 line:82%
What has the story come to...

1547
02:20:44.311 --> 02:20:45.562 line:82%
I do.

1548
02:20:48.348 --> 02:20:49.352 line:82%
I do.

1549
02:21:08.377 --> 02:21:13.465 line:82%
The bus that left from Lahore met with
an accident before it could reach India.

1550
02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:20.097 line:82%
Everyone was killed. My name
was in the list of passengers too.

1551
02:21:22.307 --> 02:21:27.312 line:82%
I was glad that mom and dad
would get the news of my demise.

1552
02:21:29.690 --> 02:21:32.963 line:82%
If they had got the news
of me going missing

1553
02:21:33.153 --> 02:21:38.490 line:82%
they'd neither be able
to live, nor die in peace.

1554
02:21:39.074 --> 02:21:42.411 line:82%
In India, Veer Singh was dead.

1555
02:21:42.828 --> 02:21:46.957 line:82%
And there was no one
by the name of Veer Singh in Pakistan.

1556
02:21:50.001 --> 02:21:54.131 line:82%
He had just one identity now.

1557
02:21:56.133 --> 02:22:00.011 line:82%
Prisoner number 786.

1558
02:22:10.689 --> 02:22:15.819 line:82%
786...

1559
02:22:18.655 --> 02:22:22.033 line:82%
My country owes
you 22 years of your life.

1560
02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:27.247 line:82%
I can't get you those 22 years back.

1561
02:22:30.542 --> 02:22:33.295 line:82%
But I promise you.

1562
02:22:33.295 --> 02:22:36.131 line:82%
I won't offer flowers
on my father's coffin

1563
02:22:36.131 --> 02:22:38.592 line:82%
until Veer Pratap Singh
gets his name,

1564
02:22:38.592 --> 02:22:41.970 line:82%
identity and country back.

1565
02:23:06.703 --> 02:23:08.832 line:82%
So, Ms. Samya Siddique,
this is your first case.

1566
02:23:08.872 --> 02:23:09.940 line:82%
Yes.

1567
02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:11.708 line:82%
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.

1568
02:23:11.708 --> 02:23:14.795 line:82%
And you're the defense council
on behalf of the Human Rights Commission.

1569
02:23:14.795 --> 02:23:17.839 line:82%
-That's right, sir.
-Good. That's good.

1570
02:23:17.839 --> 02:23:20.300 line:82%
There's no one from the prosecution yet.

1571
02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:22.844 line:82%
-Well, sir, he's on his way.
-May I come in, sir?

1572
02:23:23.386 --> 02:23:25.263 line:82%
Mr. Zakir, come in.

1573
02:23:26.598 --> 02:23:28.266 line:82%
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

1574
02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:30.310 line:82%
-Please come.
-Thank you.

1575
02:23:30.769 --> 02:23:33.480 line:82%
-That's Mr. Zakir Ahmed.
-I know.

1576
02:23:34.689 --> 02:23:37.108 line:82%
I know him quite well.

1577
02:23:38.819 --> 02:23:40.028 line:82%
Please come.

1578
02:23:40.028 --> 02:23:42.989 line:82%
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
You're aware of the traffic in Lahore.

1579
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:45.659 line:82%
Mr. Zakir,

1580
02:23:45.659 --> 02:23:48.787 line:82%
are you presenting this case on
be half of the Government of Pakistan?

1581
02:23:48.787 --> 02:23:51.832 line:82%
Yes. Actually, it's been a long time
since I came to court.

1582
02:23:52.123 --> 02:23:54.084 line:82%
People might think that Zakir Ahmed

1583
02:23:54.084 --> 02:23:55.836 line:82%
has forgotten how to fight a case.

1584
02:23:55.836 --> 02:23:58.630 line:82%
And anyway, this case seems interesting.

1585
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:59.840 line:82%
What do you think, Samya?

1586
02:24:01.758 --> 02:24:06.304 line:82%
-Do you know each other?
-Yes.

1587
02:24:06.304 --> 02:24:09.683 line:82%
Samya used to work for me,

1588
02:24:09.683 --> 02:24:11.643 line:82%
but perhaps, she didn't
like the way I functioned and so,

1589
02:24:11.643 --> 02:24:14.187 line:82%
she joined the Human Rights camp.

1590
02:24:14.729 --> 02:24:19.526 line:82%
She's a talented lady.
It'll be fun to argue against her.

1591
02:24:21.778 --> 02:24:25.657 line:82%
Look, I had a special motive
behind calling you two here.

1592
02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:32.038 line:82%
I'd be better if both the parties
compromised outside the court.

1593
02:24:33.081 --> 02:24:35.834 line:82%
Or else, the date for the day
after tomorrow is fixed for the hearing.

1594
02:24:35.834 --> 02:24:39.296 line:82%
If the case doesn't
commence the day after tomorrow

1595
02:24:39.296 --> 02:24:42.173 line:82%
then you might have
to wait for another six months

1596
02:24:42.173 --> 02:24:43.675 line:82%
or even a year for the next hearing.

1597
02:24:43.675 --> 02:24:45.135 line:82%
We're ready, sir.

1598
02:24:45.135 --> 02:24:48.096 line:82%
-But if the defense lawyer needs time...
-I'm ready, sir.

1599
02:24:48.096 --> 02:24:49.931 line:82%
But Samya...

1600
02:24:49.931 --> 02:24:51.933 line:82%
Sir, let's have the hearing
the day after tomorrow.

1601
02:24:52.517 --> 02:24:56.146 line:82%
My client has been awaiting
justice for the past 22 years.

1602
02:24:56.146 --> 02:25:00.609 line:82%
-I can't make him wait anymore.
-Okay, then. That's fixed.

1603
02:25:02.444 --> 02:25:05.322 line:82%
Thank you for coming here.

1604
02:25:05.322 --> 02:25:07.157 line:82%
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1605
02:25:10.035 --> 02:25:15.206 line:82%
Okay, Samya.
I'll see you in court. Good bye.

1606
02:25:21.504 --> 02:25:23.757 line:82%
This case seemed impossible
to win since the beginning.

1607
02:25:23.757 --> 02:25:26.509 line:82%
And now that Zakir Ahmed
is against us, we stand no chance.

1608
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:31.306 line:82%
But this case is way below his standards.
Then, I wonder why...

1609
02:25:31.806 --> 02:25:33.892 line:82%
I just don't understand.

1610
02:25:33.892 --> 02:25:37.479 line:82%
Look, make some excuse and
withdraw yourself from this case.

1611
02:25:37.896 --> 02:25:39.648 line:82%
This is your first case.

1612
02:25:39.648 --> 02:25:43.193 line:82%
You know how Zakir Ahmed
humiliates his opposition.

1613
02:25:43.193 --> 02:25:47.113 line:82%
-He'll destroy your career.
-That's what he wants.

1614
02:25:47.113 --> 02:25:48.365 line:82%
What do you mean?

1615
02:25:48.365 --> 02:25:49.741 line:82%
Sahir, I'll tell you what.

1616
02:25:49.741 --> 02:25:52.118 line:82%
Go to the office and
prepare a list of the witnesses.

1617
02:25:52.118 --> 02:25:53.495 line:82%
I'll be right there.

1618
02:25:53.495 --> 02:25:55.538 line:82%
-But where are you going?
-To meet Zakir Ahmed.

1619
02:25:55.538 --> 02:25:59.042 line:82%
Okay... What! Samya...

1620
02:26:00.835 --> 02:26:03.421 line:82%
Ms. Samya Siddique.

1621
02:26:04.005 --> 02:26:08.593 line:82%
You had sworn to never again
step inside my office.

1622
02:26:08.593 --> 02:26:11.638 line:82%
How come you're here
to see my face today?

1623
02:26:11.638 --> 02:26:13.848 line:82%
It's nothing like that, sir.

1624
02:26:13.848 --> 02:26:17.560 line:82%
Our principles were different,
that's all.

1625
02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:21.564 line:82%
And I thought that if
I can't respect your principles

1626
02:26:21.564 --> 02:26:24.651 line:82%
then I should quit.

1627
02:26:24.651 --> 02:26:28.780 line:82%
Interesting. Very interesting.

1628
02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:31.449 line:82%
You have such great
principles at a very young age.

1629
02:26:31.449 --> 02:26:34.536 line:82%
I've inherited my
principles from my father, sir.

1630
02:26:35.829 --> 02:26:37.789 line:82%
Do you know, Samya?

1631
02:26:37.789 --> 02:26:42.961 line:82%
You're the first person to have
refused a case offered by Zakir Ahmed.

1632
02:26:42.961 --> 02:26:46.506 line:82%
People wait for several years
to have their first case.

1633
02:26:47.424 --> 02:26:51.678 line:82%
But I recognized your
talent and chose you.

1634
02:26:51.678 --> 02:26:53.722 line:82%
I didn't even consider
your age and experience,

1635
02:26:53.722 --> 02:26:57.267 line:82%
or even the fact that you're a woman.

1636
02:26:57.267 --> 02:27:01.229 line:82%
And what did you do in return?
You bluntly rejected that case.

1637
02:27:02.313 --> 02:27:05.191 line:82%
That case would
have freed a criminal, sir,

1638
02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:07.110 line:82%
and the way I saw it,
that was wrong.

1639
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:10.113 line:82%
It's not the lawyer's job to think
about what's right and wrong!

1640
02:27:10.113 --> 02:27:11.656 line:82%
The court does that.

1641
02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:16.328 line:82%
A lawyer's job is to win the case,
no matter what! That's it!

1642
02:27:17.579 --> 02:27:20.415 line:82%
That's the difference
between you and me, sir.

1643
02:27:20.415 --> 02:27:25.378 line:82%
Your principle is to fight to win,
whereas I want to fight for the truth.

1644
02:27:25.378 --> 02:27:28.631 line:82%
Interesting. Very interesting.

1645
02:27:30.133 --> 02:27:33.219 line:82%
So, now,
you're going to teach me the law.

1646
02:27:33.219 --> 02:27:35.764 line:82%
This is all that was
left for me to experience.

1647
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:42.687 line:82%
All right, forget it. The incidents of
the past will only freshen our wounds.

1648
02:27:42.687 --> 02:27:46.941 line:82%
Since you've come this far,
I'm sure it's something important.

1649
02:27:47.901 --> 02:27:51.988 line:82%
Have a seat.
Tell me, how may I help you?

1650
02:27:57.077 --> 02:28:00.955 line:82%
Sir, this is my first case.

1651
02:28:00.955 --> 02:28:03.958 line:82%
Obviously, I'm going to make mistakes.

1652
02:28:04.959 --> 02:28:08.421 line:82%
And it'll be even more difficult
for me if you're in the opposition.

1653
02:28:09.381 --> 02:28:12.884 line:82%
I don't want that Indian prisoner

1654
02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:15.678 line:82%
to be deprived of freedom
because of my mistakes.

1655
02:28:15.678 --> 02:28:19.974 line:82%
Because the truth is, he is innocent.

1656
02:28:19.974 --> 02:28:23.311 line:82%
Whatever happened
with him was unfair, sir.

1657
02:28:23.311 --> 02:28:26.481 line:82%
And he deserves freedom
in all senses.

1658
02:28:29.776 --> 02:28:33.238 line:82%
So, you've fallen
to my standards eventually.

1659
02:28:33.238 --> 02:28:37.617 line:82%
Basically, you're here to seek
help to win your first case, right?

1660
02:28:40.245 --> 02:28:44.582 line:82%
Defeating Zakir Ahmed will
escalate your career, right?

1661
02:28:45.375 --> 02:28:49.379 line:82%
Perhaps, you're forgetting
that Zakir Ahmed has never lost a case.

1662
02:28:49.379 --> 02:28:52.799 line:82%
And it's all the more
important for me to win this case.

1663
02:28:52.799 --> 02:28:57.345 line:82%
Because I want to teach
a lesson to people like you

1664
02:28:57.345 --> 02:29:02.308 line:82%
for refusing to follow the principles
of Zakir Ahmed.

1665
02:29:05.478 --> 02:29:08.148 line:82%
What happened, Ms. Samya Siddique?

1666
02:29:08.148 --> 02:29:11.317 line:82%
Don't you believe in the
principles of truth anymore?

1667
02:29:11.317 --> 02:29:13.653 line:82%
Why have you come
here to beg for your win?

1668
02:29:14.654 --> 02:29:18.783 line:82%
I'm sorry, sir.
I mistook you for a human being.

1669
02:29:20.577 --> 02:29:24.414 line:82%
I only came to discuss if there is a way

1670
02:29:24.414 --> 02:29:29.294 line:82%
to resolve this outside
of court to get this man freedom.

1671
02:29:29.294 --> 02:29:32.672 line:82%
But you consider my
humanity as my weakness.

1672
02:29:34.966 --> 02:29:39.762 line:82%
Now I'll see you in court, sir.
Be prepared to face your first defeat.

1673
02:29:40.972 --> 02:29:46.477 line:82%
Because now, even the government
of Pakistan cannot stop me

1674
02:29:46.477 --> 02:29:48.688 line:82%
from sending prisoner number
786 back to India, let alone you.

1675
02:29:54.861 --> 02:29:58.072 line:82%
Interesting. Very interesting.

1676
02:30:03.494 --> 02:30:05.872 line:82%
May I ask you something?

1677
02:30:06.915 --> 02:30:10.335 line:82%
You didn't talk to anyone
all these years.

1678
02:30:10.335 --> 02:30:12.545 line:82%
Then why did you tell me your story?

1679
02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:21.012 line:82%
You called me by my name.

1680
02:30:22.138 --> 02:30:24.015 line:82%
What?

1681
02:30:24.724 --> 02:30:30.104 line:82%
You're the first person
who thought I was innocent.

1682
02:30:30.104 --> 02:30:35.526 line:82%
You're the first person
who believed that I'm Veer Singh.

1683
02:30:39.697 --> 02:30:45.578 line:82%
The truth is, in all these years,
I had forgotten who I am.

1684
02:30:48.373 --> 02:30:52.502 line:82%
You reminded me of my identity.

1685
02:30:53.378 --> 02:30:56.339 line:82%
You called me by my
name and gave me respect.

1686
02:30:57.257 --> 02:31:01.803 line:82%
Veer. Veer Pratap Singh.

1687
02:31:06.975 --> 02:31:09.978 line:82%
22 years...

1688
02:31:09.978 --> 02:31:14.399 line:82%
For a prisoner who's been
humiliated for the past 22 years

1689
02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:19.904 line:82%
this was a great deal.
A great deal.

1690
02:31:29.247 --> 02:31:32.709 line:82%
I'm going to eat more.

1691
02:31:38.548 --> 02:31:40.425 line:82%
Tomorrow's our
first hearing in the court.

1692
02:31:40.425 --> 02:31:42.302 line:82%
I hope you remember your promise.

1693
02:31:43.428 --> 02:31:45.888 line:82%
You have to change your
appearance from prisoner number 786

1694
02:31:45.888 --> 02:31:48.516 line:82%
and come as
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

1695
02:31:50.282 --> 02:31:53.521 line:82%
-No.
-What?

1696
02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:55.481 line:82%
Do you remember your promise?

1697
02:31:55.481 --> 02:32:01.279 line:82%
Absolutely. Zaara or the Hayat Khan
family won't be mentioned in court.

1698
02:32:01.279 --> 02:32:06.326 line:82%
You stay true to your promise,
and I'll fulfill mine.

1699
02:32:35.521 --> 02:32:40.360 line:82%
Your Honor, the defense would
like to call its first witness.

1700
02:32:44.155 --> 02:32:47.283 line:82%
The defense calls its first witness.

1701
02:32:49.577 --> 02:32:51.996 line:82%
The defense rests, Your Honor.

1702
02:33:54.851 --> 02:33:58.229 line:82%
The prosecution is
permitted to present their case.

1703
02:34:00.898 --> 02:34:02.650 line:82%
Your Honor,

1704
02:34:03.317 --> 02:34:08.281 line:82%
a person was confined
in prison for the past 22 years.

1705
02:34:09.782 --> 02:34:13.578 line:82%
That prison is in Pakistan.

1706
02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:20.460 line:82%
And the person who's been imprisoned in
a Pakistani prison for the past 22 years

1707
02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:24.088 line:82%
is an Indian.

1708
02:34:25.256 --> 02:34:30.178 line:82%
On hearing this, you, I

1709
02:34:30.178 --> 02:34:34.098 line:82%
and the people
here might get a bit emotional.

1710
02:34:35.099 --> 02:34:40.521 line:82%
We'd want this person to return
to his country somehow.

1711
02:34:41.647 --> 02:34:43.900 line:82%
We'd like him to go home.

1712
02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:45.485 line:82%
Because we're humans.

1713
02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:49.322 line:82%
And we've been taught to value humans.

1714
02:34:50.615 --> 02:34:52.617 line:82%
But, Your Honor,

1715
02:34:53.075 --> 02:34:58.331 line:82%
what humans can't analyze
in court, the law does.

1716
02:34:58.331 --> 02:35:01.834 line:82%
And for the law,
a country is greater than any human.

1717
02:35:01.834 --> 02:35:04.879 line:82%
And the person who
works against a country

1718
02:35:04.879 --> 02:35:08.049 line:82%
deserves not just 22 years
of imprisonment, but the death penalty!

1719
02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:19.227 line:82%
This case is absolutely transparent,
Your Honor.

1720
02:35:19.227 --> 02:35:22.063 line:82%
There's no scope for doubt in this case.

1721
02:35:22.438 --> 02:35:24.440 line:82%
The prosecution
will prove in 30 minutes,

1722
02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:27.818 line:82%
with the help
of only three witnesses

1723
02:35:27.818 --> 02:35:32.949 line:82%
that the accused Rajesh Rathore does
not deserve to go back to his country.

1724
02:35:34.242 --> 02:35:35.743 line:82%
That's all, Your Honor.

1725
02:35:37.119 --> 02:35:40.373 line:82%
I now permit the defense
to present their case.

1726
02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:46.212 line:82%
Ms. Siddique, best of luck.

1727
02:36:14.824 --> 02:36:19.203 line:82%
Your Honor, the prosecution council,
Mr. Zahir Khan, easily...

1728
02:36:19.203 --> 02:36:20.371 line:82%
Zakir Ahmed.

1729
02:36:20.371 --> 02:36:23.583 line:82%
He easily said that this case
is absolutely transparent.

1730
02:36:23.583 --> 02:36:25.167 line:82%
But Mr. Zahir Khan has forgotten...

1731
02:36:25.167 --> 02:36:27.420 line:82%
Samya Siddique,
my name is Zakir Ahmed.

1732
02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:30.798 line:82%
You got furious on being
called by the wrong name just once.

1733
02:36:30.798 --> 02:36:32.049 line:82%
Just imagine!

1734
02:36:32.049 --> 02:36:34.885 line:82%
What would you go
through if people called you

1735
02:36:34.885 --> 02:36:36.429 line:82%
by the wrong name for 22 years?

1736
02:36:41.058 --> 02:36:47.106 line:82%
Your Honor, this case isn't being
fought only to send an Indian back home.

1737
02:36:47.565 --> 02:36:52.445 line:82%
This case is being fought
to get a person his identity back.

1738
02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:56.324 line:82%
A man is asking for
his name back, Your Honor.

1739
02:36:56.616 --> 02:37:00.494 line:82%
He says he is Veer Pratap Singh.

1740
02:37:00.995 --> 02:37:04.749 line:82%
Ex-Indian Air Force Officer,
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

1741
02:37:06.626 --> 02:37:09.879 line:82%
All he wants is his name back,

1742
02:37:09.879 --> 02:37:12.298 line:82%
with respect. That's it.

1743
02:37:12.298 --> 02:37:16.802 line:82%
Your Honor, I may need more than 30
minutes, unlike the prosecution council

1744
02:37:16.802 --> 02:37:22.183 line:82%
but I will prove that he is
Veer Pratap Singh, not Rajesh Rathore.

1745
02:37:22.183 --> 02:37:27.480 line:82%
Then, whether you send him to India
or keep him in Pakistan is your decision.

1746
02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:29.732 line:82%
That's all, Your Honor.

1747
02:37:30.358 --> 02:37:33.027 line:82%
The prosecution may
now present his witnesses.

1748
02:37:33.027 --> 02:37:37.073 line:82%
Your Honor,
I'd like to call upon my first witness,

1749
02:37:37.073 --> 02:37:39.367 line:82%
Police Inspector Dilbaaz Khan.

1750
02:37:39.367 --> 02:37:44.538 line:82%
22 years ago, he was the one
who arrested Rajesh Rathore.

1751
02:37:44.538 --> 02:37:47.375 line:82%
Dilbaaz Khan be summoned.

1752
02:37:47.375 --> 02:37:49.377 line:82%
Can you tell the court

1753
02:37:49.377 --> 02:37:53.839 line:82%
without any hesitations
as to who this man is?

1754
02:37:53.839 --> 02:37:56.509 line:82%
Yes, I remember clearly.

1755
02:37:56.509 --> 02:38:00.680 line:82%
This man is a spy from India,
a RAW agent, Rajesh Rathore.

1756
02:38:01.597 --> 02:38:04.809 line:82%
Around 22 years ago,
Anwar Ali and I

1757
02:38:04.809 --> 02:38:08.229 line:82%
made him get off the bus heading
to India from Lahore, and arrested him.

1758
02:38:09.105 --> 02:38:11.315 line:82%
We had information
from the intelligence

1759
02:38:11.315 --> 02:38:14.527 line:82%
that this man was
conspiring against Pakistan.

1760
02:38:14.527 --> 02:38:16.946 line:82%
-Good.
-Mr. Anwar Ali,

1761
02:38:16.946 --> 02:38:19.323 line:82%
tell me something.

1762
02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:24.412 line:82%
If you found a passport in
his bag with the name of Rajesh Rathore

1763
02:38:24.412 --> 02:38:28.708 line:82%
then how is it possible
for that man to travel

1764
02:38:28.708 --> 02:38:31.168 line:82%
by the name of Veer Pratap Singh?

1765
02:38:31.168 --> 02:38:34.130 line:82%
That's the catch, sir.

1766
02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:39.719 line:82%
Sir, this man had a passport
in the name of Veer Pratap Singh too.

1767
02:38:39.719 --> 02:38:43.889 line:82%
How can one man have two passports?

1768
02:38:43.889 --> 02:38:47.143 line:82%
That's why our suspicion turned true.

1769
02:38:47.518 --> 02:38:49.729 line:82%
And when we inquired

1770
02:38:49.729 --> 02:38:52.982 line:82%
this man signed
on the statement himself,

1771
02:38:52.982 --> 02:38:55.359 line:82%
stating that he was Rajesh Rathore.

1772
02:38:57.027 --> 02:39:01.157 line:82%
I've been seeing him
for the past 10 years.

1773
02:39:01.157 --> 02:39:04.076 line:82%
He's always quiet and isolated.

1774
02:39:04.076 --> 02:39:06.245 line:82%
He minds his own business.

1775
02:39:07.204 --> 02:39:12.835 line:82%
But, whenever a prisoner
fell ill or was in distress

1776
02:39:13.544 --> 02:39:16.881 line:82%
he'd help him
and encourage him.

1777
02:39:18.132 --> 02:39:22.845 line:82%
I don't know whether he's
Veer Pratap Singh or Rajesh Rathore.

1778
02:39:23.804 --> 02:39:27.558 line:82%
For me,
he's only prisoner number 786.

1779
02:39:29.059 --> 02:39:31.187 line:82%
A man of God.

1780
02:39:32.855 --> 02:39:37.777 line:82%
Sir, this Hindu man is a kind man.

1781
02:39:39.069 --> 02:39:44.950 line:82%
He spent the last 22 years in prison.
What could be a bigger punishment?

1782
02:39:47.036 --> 02:39:51.916 line:82%
Please, send him back to his country.

1783
02:39:53.042 --> 02:39:56.587 line:82%
Please send him back, sir.

1784
02:39:56.587 --> 02:40:02.343 line:82%
Mr. Majid Khan, perhaps, you're
not too fond of your country Pakistan.

1785
02:40:03.385 --> 02:40:08.891 line:82%
You'd want every person who
spies on and conspires against Pakistan

1786
02:40:08.891 --> 02:40:12.144 line:82%
to be proved not guilty by court.

1787
02:40:12.144 --> 02:40:13.646 line:82%
That's not what I meant, sir...

1788
02:40:13.646 --> 02:40:16.398 line:82%
Just answer in a yes or a no,
Mr. Majid Khan.

1789
02:40:16.398 --> 02:40:19.318 line:82%
Yes or no!

1790
02:40:21.362 --> 02:40:22.988 line:82%
-No.
-Good.

1791
02:40:23.405 --> 02:40:24.410 line:82%
Your witness.

1792
02:40:27.451 --> 02:40:29.328 line:82%
No questions, Your Honor.

1793
02:40:36.043 --> 02:40:41.632 line:82%
The next hearing of this case
is exactly one week from now

1794
02:40:41.632 --> 02:40:44.051 line:82%
on Monday, March 21.

1795
02:40:44.677 --> 02:40:47.471 line:82%
We'll listen to the defense's case then.

1796
02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:51.267 line:82%
And after that,
I will announce my decision.

1797
02:40:51.267 --> 02:40:53.561 line:82%
The defense should prepare their case.

1798
02:40:54.144 --> 02:40:56.939 line:82%
The court is adjourned for the day.

1799
02:41:20.796 --> 02:41:23.674 line:82%
-I'll have to mention Zaara.
-No.

1800
02:41:23.674 --> 02:41:29.805 line:82%
Please. Once I bring Zaara or any
member of the Hayat Khan family in court

1801
02:41:29.805 --> 02:41:33.350 line:82%
-the decision will fall in our favor.
-Absolutely not.

1802
02:41:34.685 --> 02:41:39.690 line:82%
Why don't you understand?
We're losing this case.

1803
02:41:39.690 --> 02:41:42.860 line:82%
The court has no time
for prisoners like you.

1804
02:41:44.737 --> 02:41:47.990 line:82%
There are too many prisoners
and too little courts in this country.

1805
02:41:49.199 --> 02:41:53.162 line:82%
Some prisoners get their
hearing dates after they're dead.

1806
02:41:54.705 --> 02:41:56.999 line:82%
You won't get this opportunity again.

1807
02:41:57.625 --> 02:42:02.713 line:82%
You'll die here someday.
You'll die! Why don't you understand?

1808
02:42:11.472 --> 02:42:14.308 line:82%
Zaara must be a mother of two by now.

1809
02:42:19.188 --> 02:42:24.443 line:82%
She might have a 21-year-old daughter

1810
02:42:24.443 --> 02:42:26.195 line:82%
and a 19-year-old son.

1811
02:42:27.613 --> 02:42:30.866 line:82%
She must have passed every good
and bad phase of her life already.

1812
02:42:33.285 --> 02:42:39.041 line:82%
Every morning and evening
of hers must be in a fine rhythm now.

1813
02:42:42.753 --> 02:42:46.799 line:82%
Zaara must be leading her life in peace.

1814
02:42:47.424 --> 02:42:49.218 line:82%
Zaara.

1815
02:42:51.512 --> 02:42:54.682 line:82%
And tomorrow,
you'll bring her to court and ask her

1816
02:42:54.682 --> 02:42:56.767 line:82%
who Veer Pratap Singh is.

1817
02:42:57.434 --> 02:42:59.561 line:82%
Questions will be raised.

1818
02:43:00.229 --> 02:43:02.523 line:82%
Questions will be
raised on our relationship

1819
02:43:02.856 --> 02:43:07.152 line:82%
and no one will be able
to understand the answer. No one!

1820
02:43:08.654 --> 02:43:12.419 line:82%
And in a moment,
Raza Sharazi will divorce her.

1821
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:16.412 line:82%
Zaara's life will be ruined.

1822
02:43:19.581 --> 02:43:22.626 line:82%
Zaara must be happy.

1823
02:43:26.046 --> 02:43:30.134 line:82%
I've been protecting her honor
for the past 22 years.

1824
02:43:31.844 --> 02:43:35.180 line:82%
How can I destroy that honor

1825
02:43:36.432 --> 02:43:37.975 line:82%
just to go home?

1826
02:43:47.318 --> 02:43:50.029 line:82%
I can't do this, Samya.

1827
02:43:50.029 --> 02:43:53.949 line:82%
And I know that you
can't do this either.

1828
02:44:01.749 --> 02:44:03.417 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1829
02:44:05.586 --> 02:44:08.630 line:82%
I forgot my humanity for a while.

1830
02:44:10.678 --> 02:44:11.717 line:82%
I had forgotten...

1831
02:44:11.717 --> 02:44:16.388 line:82%
That Veer and Zaara's
name can't be taken together.

1832
02:44:22.603 --> 02:44:26.857 line:82%
There's only one way now.
I'll have to go to India.

1833
02:44:31.111 --> 02:44:35.115 line:82%
I'll have to bring Veer Pratap Singh's
identity back from his country.

1834
02:44:36.492 --> 02:44:41.246 line:82%
I don't have much time.
I'll go soon. Goodbye.

1835
02:44:46.168 --> 02:44:47.669 line:82%
Samya.

1836
02:44:52.132 --> 02:44:56.762 line:82%
This talisman has
been protecting me so far.

1837
02:44:58.263 --> 02:45:01.141 line:82%
It'll protect you now.

1838
02:45:08.899 --> 02:45:13.403 line:82%
Will you forgive me if I lose?

1839
02:45:17.574 --> 02:45:19.326 line:82%
On one condition.

1840
02:45:21.954 --> 02:45:26.416 line:82%
If you bring me
gram flour sweets every day.

1841
02:45:31.797 --> 02:45:33.006 line:82%
Goodbye.

1842
02:45:55.612 --> 02:45:57.698 line:82%
Excuse me, mister.

1843
02:46:05.622 --> 02:46:09.793 line:82%
Excuse me. Can you tell me where
Chaudhary Sumer Singh's house is?

1844
02:46:09.793 --> 02:46:13.881 line:82%
Yes, sure. The biggest house
in that corner is his house.

1845
02:46:13.881 --> 02:46:16.717 line:82%
-Thank you.
-But, whom do you want to meet?

1846
02:46:16.717 --> 02:46:19.761 line:82%
Mr. Chaudhary or his wife.

1847
02:46:19.761 --> 02:46:23.223 line:82%
-Well, they died several years ago.
-What!

1848
02:46:27.978 --> 02:46:33.483 line:82%
You can have a look at the house
if you want. It's open.

1849
02:46:33.483 --> 02:46:36.987 line:82%
I'm in a rush.
Please excuse me. Bye.

1850
02:47:28.163 --> 02:47:30.958 line:82%
Zaara! Zaara!

1851
02:47:43.428 --> 02:47:45.931 line:82%
I won't spare you.

1852
02:48:09.246 --> 02:48:11.790 line:82%
Who are you?
What do you want?

1853
02:48:14.501 --> 02:48:16.420 line:82%
Why are you crying?

1854
02:48:20.132 --> 02:48:22.509 line:82%
Say something.
Are you deaf?

1855
02:48:25.387 --> 02:48:27.514 line:82%
Shabbo, look who's at the door!

1856
02:48:27.514 --> 02:48:29.558 line:82%
Jassi, come here!

1857
02:48:32.978 --> 02:48:35.397 line:82%
Take this. Silly!

1858
02:48:36.857 --> 02:48:39.401 line:82%
I'll tell your mother
that you don't study.

1859
02:48:40.569 --> 02:48:45.115 line:82%
Yes? Hello there.
What do you want?

1860
02:48:45.115 --> 02:48:49.494 line:82%
-Are you Shabbo?
-Who else could I be?

1861
02:48:50.037 --> 02:48:55.292 line:82%
And... And that's Zaara?

1862
02:48:56.251 --> 02:49:00.797 line:82%
-Is that what you're here to ask?
-Is she Zaara Hayat Khan?

1863
02:49:03.425 --> 02:49:05.552 line:82%
How do you know that name?

1864
02:49:05.552 --> 02:49:10.432 line:82%
Is she the daughter of
Jahangir Hayat Khan from Lahore?

1865
02:49:14.436 --> 02:49:16.146 line:82%
Who are you?

1866
02:49:21.193 --> 02:49:26.156 line:82%
Zaara called off her marriage
on hearing about Veer's death.

1867
02:49:29.159 --> 02:49:31.870 line:82%
Her father got her the divorce.

1868
02:49:33.747 --> 02:49:38.960 line:82%
Zaara wanted to help Veer's
parents in fulfilling their dream.

1869
02:49:41.546 --> 02:49:44.383 line:82%
Raza is settled abroad.

1870
02:49:45.384 --> 02:49:47.969 line:82%
Her father quit politics.

1871
02:49:49.054 --> 02:49:52.265 line:82%
He died two years later.

1872
02:49:53.934 --> 02:49:58.438 line:82%
Then, a few years later,
her mother died too.

1873
02:50:00.023 --> 02:50:04.069 line:82%
The Hayat Khan family vanished.

1874
02:50:06.196 --> 02:50:09.282 line:82%
Now, Veer's parents are no more either.

1875
02:50:10.283 --> 02:50:12.452 line:82%
And she doesn't want to return.

1876
02:50:12.994 --> 02:50:16.540 line:82%
She says that her soul is settled here.

1877
02:50:18.417 --> 02:50:22.504 line:82%
Now she has to live here,
and die here.

1878
02:50:22.504 --> 02:50:24.548 line:82%
Do this...

1879
02:50:29.344 --> 02:50:32.806 line:82%
What kind of people are they, Shabbo?

1880
02:50:32.806 --> 02:50:37.227 line:82%
Veer sacrificed 22 years of his life

1881
02:50:37.227 --> 02:50:40.480 line:82%
so easily.

1882
02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:44.109 line:82%
So that Zaara could have a better life.

1883
02:50:44.109 --> 02:50:49.364 line:82%
And Zaara dedicated
22 years of her life

1884
02:50:49.364 --> 02:50:52.284 line:82%
to an unknown country,
to unknown people.

1885
02:50:53.243 --> 02:50:55.787 line:82%
So that Veer's dream
could remain alive.

1886
02:50:57.873 --> 02:51:00.834 line:82%
Are they humans disguised as God

1887
02:51:02.002 --> 02:51:04.921 line:82%
or God disguised as humans?

1888
02:51:34.159 --> 02:51:35.952 line:82%
This...

1889
02:51:37.662 --> 02:51:40.707 line:82%
-This is...
-That's what it is.

1890
02:51:42.751 --> 02:51:47.881 line:82%
22 years ago,
Mariam Hayat Khan

1891
02:51:47.881 --> 02:51:52.886 line:82%
gave this talisman to an Indian

1892
02:51:52.886 --> 02:51:55.180 line:82%
while bidding him farewell,
to protect him.

1893
02:51:57.307 --> 02:52:00.185 line:82%
He couldn't make it to India.

1894
02:52:00.894 --> 02:52:05.315 line:82%
But this talisman
protected him for 22 years.

1895
02:52:08.401 --> 02:52:10.487 line:82%
That person is

1896
02:52:11.905 --> 02:52:13.740 line:82%
Veer Pratap Singh.

1897
02:52:21.957 --> 02:52:27.045 line:82%
He's imprisoned in Lahore.

1898
02:52:29.589 --> 02:52:31.716 line:82%
I'm his lawyer.

1899
02:52:33.134 --> 02:52:37.430 line:82%
And I'm here to take you to him.

1900
02:52:48.400 --> 02:52:52.779 line:82%
For 22 years...

1901
02:52:53.863 --> 02:52:56.366 line:82%
God has been testing you two immensely.

1902
02:52:58.368 --> 02:53:02.747 line:82%
But now, even God won't be
able to keep Zaara away from Veer.

1903
02:53:04.374 --> 02:53:08.461 line:82%
Not even God can keep
Zaara away from Veer.

1904
02:53:22.934 --> 02:53:26.021 line:82%
Mr. Sahil Farouqui,
I'd like to ask you.

1905
02:53:26.021 --> 02:53:27.606 line:82%
Where is the defense council?

1906
02:53:27.606 --> 02:53:29.399 line:82%
Your Honor, she's on her way.

1907
02:53:29.399 --> 02:53:31.318 line:82%
Perhaps, she's decided
to withdraw herself from the case,

1908
02:53:31.318 --> 02:53:33.403 line:82%
Your Honor. Please proceed.

1909
02:53:33.403 --> 02:53:35.405 line:82%
Irresponsible!

1910
02:53:35.405 --> 02:53:39.993 line:82%
This is highly irresponsible.
The defense counsel isn't here yet.

1911
02:53:39.993 --> 02:53:43.163 line:82%
Mr. Sahil Farouqui,
is there anything you'd like to say?

1912
02:53:43.163 --> 02:53:48.668 line:82%
Your Honor, Samya... I mean,
my learned colleague is on her way.

1913
02:53:48.668 --> 02:53:49.678 line:82%
There's no problem.

1914
02:53:49.738 --> 02:53:53.214 line:82%
There is a problem, Farouqui.
There certainly is.

1915
02:53:54.633 --> 02:53:59.304 line:82%
Wasting the precious
time of the court is a big deal.

1916
02:53:59.304 --> 02:54:05.018 line:82%
When I had clearly said that
the defense will present her case today,

1917
02:54:05.018 --> 02:54:07.520 line:82%
what's the reason behind her absence?

1918
02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:08.938 line:82%
It's obvious, Your Honor.

1919
02:54:08.938 --> 02:54:13.026 line:82%
The defense has no case.
The accused...

1920
02:54:13.026 --> 02:54:15.695 line:82%
From the defense...

1921
02:55:12.377 --> 02:55:17.924 line:82%
I lived for you

1922
02:55:17.924 --> 02:55:22.137 line:82%
with my lips sealed

1923
02:55:22.137 --> 02:55:27.642 line:82%
I lived for you

1924
02:55:27.642 --> 02:55:31.646 line:82%
hiding my tears

1925
02:55:31.646 --> 02:55:37.527 line:82%
But my heart kept

1926
02:55:37.527 --> 02:55:41.531 line:82%
the fire of love burning

1927
02:55:41.531 --> 02:55:46.786 line:82%
for you

1928
02:55:46.786 --> 02:55:52.208 line:82%
I lived for you

1929
02:55:52.208 --> 02:55:56.421 line:82%
hiding my tears

1930
02:55:56.421 --> 02:56:01.968 line:82%
I lived for you

1931
02:56:01.968 --> 02:56:06.014 line:82%
with my lips sealed

1932
02:56:06.014 --> 02:56:11.644 line:82%
But my heart kept

1933
02:56:11.644 --> 02:56:17.984 line:82%
the fire of love burning, for you

1934
02:56:17.984 --> 02:56:21.571 line:82%
For you

1935
02:56:46.095 --> 02:56:50.975 line:82%
Life has brought back

1936
02:56:50.975 --> 02:56:55.772 line:82%
memories of the past

1937
02:56:55.772 --> 02:57:00.735 line:82%
Life has brought back

1938
02:57:00.735 --> 02:57:05.698 line:82%
memories of the past

1939
02:57:05.698 --> 02:57:10.662 line:82%
We've been surrounded

1940
02:57:10.662 --> 02:57:15.375 line:82%
by innumerable incidents of the past

1941
02:57:15.375 --> 02:57:20.421 line:82%
I've got several answers

1942
02:57:20.421 --> 02:57:24.425 line:82%
without even asking for them

1943
02:57:24.425 --> 02:57:30.306 line:82%
I've got what I didn't even ask for

1944
02:57:30.306 --> 02:57:34.102 line:82%
Look at our fate!

1945
02:57:34.102 --> 02:57:39.941 line:82%
But my heart kept

1946
02:57:39.941 --> 02:57:46.447 line:82%
the fire of love burning, for you

1947
02:57:46.447 --> 02:57:50.410 line:82%
For you

1948
02:58:09.429 --> 02:58:14.350 line:82%
You have no idea

1949
02:58:14.350 --> 02:58:19.355 line:82%
how unfair the world has been to me

1950
02:58:19.355 --> 02:58:24.193 line:82%
You have no idea

1951
02:58:24.193 --> 02:58:28.990 line:82%
how unfair the world has been to me

1952
02:58:28.990 --> 02:58:33.912 line:82%
I was ordered

1953
02:58:33.912 --> 02:58:38.750 line:82%
to live without you

1954
02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:43.755 line:82%
Naive are those who say

1955
02:58:43.755 --> 02:58:48.051 line:82%
that you're unknown to me

1956
02:58:48.051 --> 02:58:53.598 line:82%
People have been committing

1957
02:58:53.598 --> 02:58:57.560 line:82%
atrocities on us

1958
02:58:57.560 --> 02:59:03.483 line:82%
But my heart kept

1959
02:59:03.483 --> 02:59:07.362 line:82%
the fire of love burning

1960
02:59:07.362 --> 02:59:12.408 line:82%
for you...

1961
02:59:12.408 --> 02:59:17.956 line:82%
I lived for you

1962
02:59:17.956 --> 02:59:22.418 line:82%
with my lips sealed

1963
02:59:22.418 --> 02:59:27.924 line:82%
I lived for you

1964
02:59:27.924 --> 02:59:31.761 line:82%
hiding my tears

1965
02:59:31.761 --> 02:59:37.809 line:82%
But my heart kept

1966
02:59:37.809 --> 02:59:41.771 line:82%
the fire of love burning

1967
02:59:41.771 --> 02:59:46.484 line:82%
for you...

1968
02:59:46.484 --> 02:59:49.362 line:82%
For you

1969
02:59:49.362 --> 02:59:51.656 line:82%
For you

1970
02:59:51.656 --> 02:59:54.158 line:82%
For you

1971
02:59:54.158 --> 02:59:57.537 line:82%
For you.

1972
03:00:12.051 --> 03:00:15.221 line:82%
Zaara Hayat Khan's testimony

1973
03:00:16.264 --> 03:00:21.227 line:82%
and the pictures and
proof that she has brought along

1974
03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:25.982 line:82%
prove that this man
isn't Rajesh Rathore,

1975
03:00:25.982 --> 03:00:28.109 line:82%
but Veer Pratap Singh.

1976
03:00:29.444 --> 03:00:34.949 line:82%
And in order to keep the honor
of a Pakistani girl intact

1977
03:00:35.950 --> 03:00:38.953 line:82%
Veer Pratap Singh had
signed that confession.

1978
03:00:40.204 --> 03:00:42.999 line:82%
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

1979
03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.836 line:82%
The court declares you not guilty.

1980
03:00:52.842 --> 03:00:55.344 line:82%
Order! Order!

1981
03:00:55.344 --> 03:00:58.556 line:82%
Go on, Veer Pratap Singh.

1982
03:00:59.682 --> 03:01:03.061 line:82%
You have the right to go
back to your country with pride.

1983
03:01:07.648 --> 03:01:10.485 line:82%
You've wasted 22 precious years
of your life

1984
03:01:11.527 --> 03:01:14.322 line:82%
in prison.

1985
03:01:14.322 --> 03:01:17.241 line:82%
The Government
of Pakistan and the court

1986
03:01:17.241 --> 03:01:20.036 line:82%
wish to apologize to you.

1987
03:01:21.245 --> 03:01:25.625 line:82%
If there's something that you'd
like to say, you have my permission.

1988
03:01:44.644 --> 03:01:46.604 line:82%
I...

1989
03:01:48.314 --> 03:01:51.359 line:82%
When I, prisoner number 786

1990
03:01:51.359 --> 03:01:53.903 line:82%
look outside the bars of prison

1991
03:01:55.321 --> 03:01:59.784 line:82%
I see days,
months and years turn into eras.

1992
03:02:01.911 --> 03:02:05.498 line:82%
The land here smells of

1993
03:02:05.498 --> 03:02:08.209 line:82%
my father's farms.

1994
03:02:09.919 --> 03:02:14.924 line:82%
The heat here reminds me
of the buttermilk my mom used to make.

1995
03:02:17.844 --> 03:02:22.682 line:82%
The rains here bring
back memories of monsoons.

1996
03:02:23.933 --> 03:02:28.813 line:82%
The winters here remind
me of the holy fire of Lohri.

1997
03:02:31.816 --> 03:02:36.028 line:82%
They say that it's not my country.

1998
03:02:37.196 --> 03:02:40.158 line:82%
But why does it seem like my own?

1999
03:02:42.785 --> 03:02:46.622 line:82%
They say I'm not one of them.

2000
03:02:46.622 --> 03:02:50.376 line:82%
But why do I feel like I'm part of them?

2001
03:02:51.711 --> 03:02:56.757 line:82%
When I, prisoner number 786,
look outside the bars of prison

2002
03:02:58.801 --> 03:03:03.222 line:82%
I see a little angel
from a village of dreams.

2003
03:03:04.557 --> 03:03:07.560 line:82%
She calls herself Samya

2004
03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:10.062 line:82%
and calls me Veer.

2005
03:03:11.564 --> 03:03:16.569 line:82%
She's a stranger,
but treats me like a dear one.

2006
03:03:18.321 --> 03:03:23.451 line:82%
Her honesty encourages me to live again.

2007
03:03:25.536 --> 03:03:30.458 line:82%
Her promises give me
the courage to do something again.

2008
03:03:32.251 --> 03:03:35.421 line:82%
They say that she's not related to me.

2009
03:03:36.756 --> 03:03:39.800 line:82%
But then,
why does she fight the world for me?

2010
03:03:41.385 --> 03:03:45.389 line:82%
They say that I'm not one of them.

2011
03:03:45.389 --> 03:03:48.226 line:82%
But, why does she feel like a dear one?

2012
03:03:55.650 --> 03:03:58.319 line:82%
When I, prisoner number 786,

2013
03:03:59.237 --> 03:04:02.156 line:82%
look outside the bars of prison

2014
03:04:04.408 --> 03:04:07.662 line:82%
wrapped in the colors of my village.

2015
03:04:07.662 --> 03:04:09.538 line:82%
I see a new Zaara,

2016
03:04:12.124 --> 03:04:18.047 line:82%
She has forgotten her own
dreams while trying to fulfill mine.

2017
03:04:18.047 --> 03:04:23.094 line:82%
She has left her people
to serve mine.

2018
03:04:25.888 --> 03:04:27.640 line:82%
I want to fill...

2019
03:04:28.683 --> 03:04:31.185 line:82%
her life with happiness now.

2020
03:04:32.853 --> 03:04:37.942 line:82%
I want to live once again for her.

2021
03:04:40.695 --> 03:04:43.197 line:82%
They say that she doesn't belong
to my country.

2022
03:04:46.284 --> 03:04:49.287 line:82%
Then why does she live in my house?

2023
03:04:49.287 --> 03:04:51.831 line:82%
They say I'm not one of them.

2024
03:04:52.999 --> 03:04:55.876 line:82%
But why does she feel like a dear one?

2025
03:04:58.587 --> 03:05:01.382 line:82%
When I, prisoner number 786

2026
03:05:03.801 --> 03:05:08.097 line:82%
look outside the bars of prison...

2027
03:05:51.515 --> 03:05:52.641 line:82%
Thank you.

2028
03:05:52.641 --> 03:05:53.768 line:82%
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

2029
03:05:53.768 --> 03:05:54.935 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

2030
03:05:54.935 --> 03:05:56.145 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

2031
03:05:56.145 --> 03:05:57.438 line:82%
Thank you.

2032
03:05:58.189 --> 03:06:03.152 line:82%
Samya. Congratulations.

2033
03:06:04.737 --> 03:06:06.739 line:82%
Thank you.

2034
03:06:09.492 --> 03:06:12.370 line:82%
This was my last case.

2035
03:06:12.370 --> 03:06:14.872 line:82%
I'm retiring.

2036
03:06:16.707 --> 03:06:21.087 line:82%
Because today, you've taught
me that I'm not worthy of doing this.

2037
03:06:22.880 --> 03:06:25.216 line:82%
I always thought

2038
03:06:25.216 --> 03:06:28.719 line:82%
that the progress of every nation
is based on its law.

2039
03:06:29.720 --> 03:06:34.392 line:82%
But today, I realized that the fates
of these two countries

2040
03:06:34.392 --> 03:06:36.894 line:82%
lie in the hands of the youth,
like you.

2041
03:06:37.395 --> 03:06:40.022 line:82%
You don't differentiate people
on the basis of rich and poor

2042
03:06:40.022 --> 03:06:43.776 line:82%
man and woman,
or Hindu and Muslim.

2043
03:06:45.820 --> 03:06:48.030 line:82%
You don't remind people
of the bitter memories of 1947,

2044
03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:52.868 line:82%
1965 and 1999 every time.

2045
03:06:52.868 --> 03:06:54.745 line:82%
You want to make the future better

2046
03:06:54.745 --> 03:06:58.958 line:82%
only with the help of truth.

2047
03:07:00.126 --> 03:07:05.214 line:82%
And a country where
truth prevails has to progress.

2048
03:07:08.843 --> 03:07:10.928 line:82%
Thank you, Samya.

2049
03:07:10.928 --> 03:07:14.765 line:82%
Thank you for teaching
me the value of truth and justice.

2050
03:07:18.227 --> 03:07:22.690 line:82%
Your father would have
been proud of you today. Really.

2051
03:07:25.943 --> 03:07:28.112 line:82%
Bless you.

2052
03:07:30.739 --> 03:07:32.491 line:82%
Good bye.

2053
03:08:17.453 --> 03:08:20.956 line:82%
Veer lost Zaara in Pakistan.

2054
03:08:20.956 --> 03:08:24.919 line:82%
So, Veer and Zaara have
to unite in Pakistan itself.

2055
03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:35.846 line:82%
Here. Make Zaara yours for good.

2056
03:08:37.056 --> 03:08:38.557 line:82%
Come on.

2057
03:08:56.450 --> 03:09:02.248 line:82%
You'd say that Veer and Zaara's name
can never be taken together.

2058
03:09:02.248 --> 03:09:05.501 line:82%
But look, Veer and Zaara

2059
03:09:05.501 --> 03:09:07.836 line:82%
are now together forever.

2060
03:09:11.674 --> 03:09:16.011 line:82%
Veer is right.
You're an angel.

2061
03:09:16.011 --> 03:09:18.973 line:82%
God has sent you for us.

2062
03:09:23.561 --> 03:09:28.566 line:82%
Come on.
Look, your country awaits you.

2063
03:09:49.712 --> 03:09:51.380 line:82%
Let's go, Zaara.

2064
03:09:53.132 --> 03:09:55.050 line:82%
Let's go home.

2065
03:10:10.190 --> 03:10:16.864 line:82%
The land is golden
and the skies are blue

2066
03:10:16.864 --> 03:10:20.451 line:82%
The land is golden
and the skies are blue

2067
03:10:20.451 --> 03:10:22.953 line:82%
Every season seems colorful

2068
03:10:22.953 --> 03:10:26.582 line:82%
That's my country...

2069
03:10:26.582 --> 03:10:29.460 line:82%
That's my country...

2070
03:10:29.460 --> 03:10:33.339 line:82%
That's my country...

2071
03:10:33.339 --> 03:10:36.592 line:82%
That's my country.

2072
03:10:50.147 --> 03:10:55.569 line:82%
I lived for you

2073
03:10:55.569 --> 03:10:59.865 line:82%
Just for you

2074
03:10:59.865 --> 03:11:05.329 line:82%
I lived for you

2075
03:11:05.329 --> 03:11:09.208 line:82%
Just for you

2076
03:11:09.208 --> 03:11:14.046 line:82%
The distances
between us in all these years

2077
03:11:15.089 --> 03:11:19.134 line:82%
have been erased...

2078
03:11:19.134 --> 03:11:24.348 line:82%
For you...

2079
03:11:24.348 --> 03:11:29.853 line:82%
I lived for you

2080
03:11:29.853 --> 03:11:34.066 line:82%
Just for you

2081
03:11:34.066 --> 03:11:39.697 line:82%
I lived for you

2082
03:11:39.697 --> 03:11:43.617 line:82%
Just for you

2083
03:11:43.617 --> 03:11:49.373 line:82%
The distances
between us in all these years

2084
03:11:49.373 --> 03:11:53.377 line:82%
have been erased...

2085
03:11:53.377 --> 03:11:58.340 line:82%
For you...

2086
03:11:58.340 --> 03:12:00.926 line:82%
For you...

2087
03:12:00.926 --> 03:12:03.387 line:82%
For you...

2088
03:12:03.387 --> 03:12:06.098 line:82%
For you...

2089
03:12:06.098 --> 03:12:10.644 line:82%
For you.
