555
00:30:17.333 --> 00:30:18.625 line:82%
When they arrived at Mexico City,

556
00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:20.458 line:82%
they would've typically headed
to one of three areas

557
00:30:20.541 --> 00:30:22.083 line:82%
to cross into Texas and the United States:

558
00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:25.041 line:82%
El Paso, Del Rio, McAllen.

559
00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.375 line:82%
In this case, they crossed
the Rio Grande into McAllen.

560
00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:28.541 line:82%
Why McAllen?

561
00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:30.000 line:82%
A gallon of water weighs eight pounds.

562
00:30:30.083 --> 00:30:31.500 line:82%
A human being requires
between one and a half

563
00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:33.833 line:82%
and two gallons of water a day
to survive in the desert.

564
00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:35.250 line:82%
So that's 36 to 48 pounds

Edith Sanchez.

571
00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:56.750 line:82%
No, you can't possibly know
that this woman in the photo

572
00:30:56.833 --> 00:31:00.208 line:82%
is the same Edith Sanchez on these 1040s.

573
00:31:00.291 --> 00:31:01.541 line:82%
Yes, it's a certainty.

574
00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:03.041 line:82%
She claimed one dependent, a child.

575
00:31:03.125 --> 00:31:05.041 line:82%
Of the three 1040s she filed,
two had incomes

576
00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:06.333 line:82%
of roughly $15,000.

577
00:31:06.416 --> 00:31:08.916 line:82%
The third was $60,250.

578
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.666 line:82%
That's twice as much in one year
than the previous two combined.

579
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.333 line:82%
Yes. That's not the strangest part.

580
00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:14.958 line:82%
She checked "married"
but filed separately.

581
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:16.666 line:82%
Had she filed jointly,
she could've taken advantage

582
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.083 line:82%
of the child and dependent care exemption.

583
00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:19.958 line:82%
Four times as much money
in the third year,

584
00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:22.750 line:82%

has a child and no child care.

only one with a Latino surname:

587
00:31:26.791 --> 00:31:30.333 line:82%
Emiliano "Emi" Gonzalez,
Fort Worth, Texas.

588
00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:42.166 line:82%
So, if Emi was Edith's father,

589
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:43.583 line:82%
why didn't she call him for help?

590
00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:45.000 line:82%
I have no way of knowing that.

591

596

I'm not a fan of getting
pistol-whipped and robbed.

597

No, I don't remember any Edith.

598
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.166 line:82%
Sorry. Can't help you.

599

600
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.583 line:82%
-Looks great.
-Mm-hmm.

601
00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:28.500 line:82%
Why would an employee not take
all the exemptions she's eligible for?

602
00:32:28.583 --> 00:32:30.666 line:82%
'Cause she's dumb?

Neither one.

Well, I don't see people
as legal or illegal.

606

I see 'em as human beings,
and I give 'em a chance.

607
00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:40.625 line:82%
Anything else?

608
00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:42.541 line:82%
No, sir. Thanks for your time.

609
00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:44.541 line:82%
You're welcome.

Two thirds of your business
is takeout, correct?

Got my tax reports, huh?

612
00:32:54.583 --> 00:32:56.041 line:82%
You people.

613
00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:58.625 line:82%
That's right-- two thirds.

614
00:32:58.708 --> 00:32:59.708 line:82%
Ask me anything.

615
00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:01.500 line:82%
Unit costs, payroll, promotions.

616
00:33:01.583 --> 00:33:03.583 line:82%
You name it, I know where every dime goes.

617
00:33:03.666 --> 00:33:04.958 line:82%
Last year's earnings before interest,

Let's go.

624
00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:18.291 line:82%
Setting aside the amateur nature
of this preparation,

625
00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:19.708 line:82%
considering you could've deducted

626
00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:21.375 line:82%
considerably more
from your taxable income,

627
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:23.541 line:82%
what is the most frequently
ordered size of pizza?

628
00:33:23.625 --> 00:33:24.958 line:82%
Large, 90%.

629
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:30.625 line:82%
Large pizza is $17.35,
which accounts for 1,484,315 large pizzas.

630
00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.125 line:82%
What's your point?

631
00:33:32.208 --> 00:33:33.958 line:82%
Your paper costs are $360,000,

632
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:37.166 line:82%
which only accounts
for 900,000 large pizza boxes.

633
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.875 line:82%
You are making my head hurt.

634
00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:40.458 line:82%
[Christian] It's considerably less
than the aforementioned

635
00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:43.208 line:82%
1,484,315 large pizzas.

636
00:33:43.291 --> 00:33:44.750 line:82%
Right, that's because, uh,
we do it by the slice.

637
00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:46.000 line:82%
-By the slice? No.
-Yeah.

638
00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:48.750 line:82%
Impossible. You're fraudulently claiming
more income than you're receiving

639
