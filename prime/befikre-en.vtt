00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:38.911 line:82%
CAREFREE

2
00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:54.090 line:82%
What the...the TV!

3
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.175 line:82%
Psycho! You need meds!

4
00:03:56.425 --> 00:03:59.136 line:82%
How will I watch the
Arsenal-Leicester match?

5
00:03:59.303 --> 00:04:01.096 line:82%
Stupid French witch!

6
00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:04.474 line:82%
Delhi idiot, go watch the match
with the other idiot, Mehra.

7
00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.728 line:82%
And as for the TV, this French witch won
it at the Christmas fair. Remember?

8
00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:11.272 line:82%
But I paid for the fair tickets. Remember?

9
00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:13.190 line:82%
Tough luck, Desi boy.

10
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:15.006 line:82%
Get your own TV, if you can afford it.

11
00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.860 line:82%
You wanna go there? Fine!

12
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.613 line:82%
Wasn't even HD. I'll get the latest.
3D, HD TV

13
00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:23.492 line:82%
7.1 surround sound. It's
Game of Thrones all night.

14
00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:26.703 line:82%
No more "turn the sound down,
I have an early start."

15
00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:29.330 line:82%
You can't take that. I bought it.

16
00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:31.791 line:82%
It was my birthday present.

17
00:04:33.457 --> 00:04:36.420 line:82%
Actually, you know what?
I don't want your stupid present.

18
00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:40.048 line:82%
Just because I like Tweety doesn't mean
you stuff the house with them.

19
00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:42.551 line:82%
- Bloody twit.
- That's my t-shirt!

20
00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:51.184 line:82%
You're impossible!

21
00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:53.477 line:82%
No swearing in French.

22
00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:55.062 line:82%
You know what.

23
00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:59.316 line:82%
You left Delhi but your hooligan
Delhi talk didn't leave you.

24
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:00.760 line:82%
Oh yeah?

25
00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:05.071 line:82%
At least I'm not a French slut,
sleeping with every man in Paris.

26
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:20.627 line:82%
You know what?

27
00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:23.797 line:82%
I thought it was my bad.

28
00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:27.175 line:82%
Thank you for clearing that up.

29
00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:28.926 line:82%
Goodbye.

30
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.980 line:82%
Taxi.

31
00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:04.167 line:82%
Miss...

32
00:06:04.793 --> 00:06:05.793 line:82%
Ok.

33
00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:25.770 line:82%
Hi, baby!

34
00:06:26.104 --> 00:06:28.606 line:82%
Shyra darling, what a surprise!

35
00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:33.861 line:82%
If I can use my room without
the third degree, I'll stay.

36
00:06:34.504 --> 00:06:36.656 line:82%
Or I go to Kim's. You guys decide.

37
00:06:52.274 --> 00:06:54.839 line:82%
Delete his number from your phones.

38
00:06:55.843 --> 00:06:57.883 line:82%
Mum, block him on Facebook too.

39
00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:02.262 line:82%
You're on Facebook?

40
00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:07.183 line:82%
I'm from Delhi,
she's from Paris.

41
00:07:08.768 --> 00:07:11.896 line:82%
Delhi and Paris? Not happening, boss.

42
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.981 line:82%
No connection.

43
00:07:14.406 --> 00:07:16.650 line:82%
It was too good to last.

44
00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:21.446 line:82%
Sat for an English exam, the questions
came in French. Had to fail.

45
00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:26.701 line:82%
Falling in love is like investing
in mutual funds.

46
00:07:27.496 --> 00:07:31.164 line:82%
We think they'll pay dividends
when they mature.

47
00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:35.793 line:82%
But we don't think, "mutual funds
are subject to market risks.

48
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.463 line:82%
Please read the offer document
carefully before investing." Otherwise...

49
00:07:39.838 --> 00:07:41.381 line:82%
it's breakup.

50
00:07:43.632 --> 00:07:45.719 line:82%
Breakups are a pain in the...

51
00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:47.804 line:82%
When a boy gets dumped...

52
00:07:48.096 --> 00:07:51.849 line:82%
his mates get busy perfecting
the vanishing act.

53
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.060 line:82%
The married guys are busy with
their wives. You married?

54
00:07:55.312 --> 00:07:56.604 line:82%
- Yes.
- It shows.

55
00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:01.141 line:82%
The single guys are busy at work.

56
00:08:01.603 --> 00:08:06.613 line:82%
When a girl goes through a breakup,
that's another ball game.

57
00:08:07.772 --> 00:08:10.616 line:82%
Hi, Shyra. Heard about your breakup.
You ok?

58
00:08:11.275 --> 00:08:14.703 line:82%
I'm ok. No sweat. I'm on my
way to work. I'll call later.

59
00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:20.250 line:82%
Hi, Shyra. I heard the news.
Are you ok?

60
00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.016 line:82%
It's ok.

61
00:08:23.115 --> 00:08:24.879 line:82%
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

62
00:08:25.543 --> 00:08:27.757 line:82%
Hi, Shyra. I heard
what happened last night.

63
00:08:28.094 --> 00:08:29.941 line:82%
- You ok?
- I'm all right. I'm not depressed.

64
00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:32.678 line:82%
Not drinking, I'm not planning
to kill myself.

65
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.347 line:82%
Busy at work. I'll call you later.

66
00:08:37.648 --> 00:08:39.528 line:82%
Welcome to Paris Sidewalk Tours.

67
00:08:39.793 --> 00:08:43.104 line:82%
One of the most romantic bridges
in Paris: Pont des Arts.

68
00:08:43.608 --> 00:08:45.940 line:82%
It's famously called
"The Love Lock Bridge."

69
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:49.527 line:82%
There were over a million
padlocks here a year ago.

70
00:08:49.922 --> 00:08:52.144 line:82%
Couples would pledge their love
with a signed padlock

71
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.407 line:82%
and then they'd throw the key
into the river.

72
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.368 line:82%
They believed that their love,
like the padlocks,

73
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.858 line:82%
would stay locked forever.

74
00:09:00.327 --> 00:09:03.498 line:82%
A year ago the city authorities
removed all the love locks...

75
00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:07.752 line:82%
because the weight was
weakening the bridge.

76
00:09:08.305 --> 00:09:10.213 line:82%
Now padlocks are banned.

77
00:09:11.123 --> 00:09:13.716 line:82%
Even the world's most romantic
city understood that

78
00:09:14.008 --> 00:09:16.260 line:82%
few can carry the weight
of love.

79
00:09:17.274 --> 00:09:19.012 line:82%
We stop here for 15 minutes.

80
00:09:19.304 --> 00:09:23.475 line:82%
So if anybody wants to click photos,
please do.

81
00:09:26.102 --> 00:09:29.564 line:82%
The only way to avoid the sting
of a breakup...

82
00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:33.609 line:82%
is never to fall in love's trap.

83
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.237 line:82%
If you don't hook up,
you won't break up.

84
00:09:38.198 --> 00:09:42.034 line:82%
The wisest of the wise haven't
escaped from hooking up.

85
00:09:42.408 --> 00:09:44.452 line:82%
So how could a fool like me stay free?

86
00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:46.788 line:82%
- A poem!
- Please...

87
00:09:47.122 --> 00:09:48.122 line:82%
Thank you!

88
00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:51.501 line:82%
A guy called Dharam
came to Paris...

89
00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:52.792 line:82%
Bravo!

90
00:09:53.024 --> 00:09:56.505 line:82%
A guy called Dharam came to
make Parisians laugh out loud.

91
00:09:57.067 --> 00:10:00.203 line:82%
A girl stripped him so bare...

92
00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:02.886 line:82%
All he's left with now
is his underwear.

93
00:10:16.273 --> 00:10:19.193 line:82%
9 rue Théodule Ribot?
What an address!

94
00:10:19.824 --> 00:10:21.236 line:82%
Welcome to Paris, Dharam.

95
00:10:23.128 --> 00:10:24.365 line:82%
Hi, I'm Natalie.

96
00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:29.410 line:82%
You are Dharma, right?

97
00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:32.246 line:82%
Dharam! No "a" at the end.

98
00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:34.915 line:82%
Sorry. Come with me.

99
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:39.503 line:82%
So this is your room,
window opens to the church.

100
00:10:44.716 --> 00:10:45.925 line:82%
I love Jesus.

101
00:10:46.486 --> 00:10:49.387 line:82%
Bathroom - just one.
You and I using same, ok?

102
00:10:58.579 --> 00:11:01.108 line:82%
Great. Superb, Natalie!

103
00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:05.252 line:82%
So you have butter, eggs, fruit...

104
00:11:05.696 --> 00:11:06.879 line:82%
coffee, tea.

105
00:11:07.108 --> 00:11:09.405 line:82%
Everything you need.
So just please yourself, ok?

106
00:11:09.847 --> 00:11:10.990 line:82%
Catch you later.

107
00:11:13.586 --> 00:11:15.744 line:82%
Yes! Paradise at last!

108
00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:20.791 line:82%
How are you?

109
00:11:21.124 --> 00:11:22.326 line:82%
Good, darling.

110
00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:26.004 line:82%
This is my girlfriend, Naomi.

111
00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:27.666 line:82%
Naomi...Dharma.

112
00:11:35.914 --> 00:11:36.914 line:82%
Bonjour!

113
00:11:39.976 --> 00:11:42.769 line:82%
You're terrific, Mehra.
The flat's paradise.

114
00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:44.188 line:82%
The ultimate!

115
00:11:44.464 --> 00:11:47.355 line:82%
Don't need Internet.
I've got free live shows.

116
00:11:48.731 --> 00:11:50.952 line:82%
Very nice people, the French.

117
00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.270 line:82%
Forget about caste! They don't
differentiate betweenboys from girls.

118
00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:56.322 line:82%
What a culture! I love the French.

119
00:11:56.614 --> 00:11:58.574 line:82%
Started your old tricks?

120
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:02.160 line:82%
You're here to work,
not to enjoy Paris.

121
00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:05.455 line:82%
If your jokes go limp,
it's the next flight home for you, boy.

122
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.998 line:82%
Relax, Mehra!

123
00:12:07.373 --> 00:12:09.667 line:82%
My jokes have made you double up
since college.

124
00:12:09.986 --> 00:12:12.173 line:82%
Now no confidence in your bro?

125
00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:15.047 line:82%
Your bro's not out of gas.
I'm pure kickass!

126
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.259 line:82%
I'll make your Delhi Belly Bar the No.1
Paris bar, or change my name.

127
00:12:19.676 --> 00:12:22.387 line:82%
That's why I spent so many euros
jetting you here.

128
00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:26.483 line:82%
Pull in all the Indians of Paris
with your comedy nights...

129
00:12:26.808 --> 00:12:28.518 line:82%
then we'll print money!

130
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:31.437 line:82%
Ok, Mr. Slumdog Millionaire.

131
00:12:31.866 --> 00:12:34.148 line:82%
Print and mint we will.

132
00:12:34.594 --> 00:12:37.151 line:82%
But first tell me where's
the hottest bar in Paris.

133
00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:41.196 line:82%
Dharam, tomorrow's your first show...

134
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.574 line:82%
Mehra, my love. For the show
to rock tomorrow...

135
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.235 line:82%
Dharam needs to rock today!

136
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.461 line:82%
So sorry.

137
00:13:45.646 --> 00:13:47.924 line:82%
François, water. Quick!

138
00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:51.135 line:82%
Thank you.

139
00:13:59.893 --> 00:14:03.313 line:82%
- You're a lifesaver, François.
- No worries.

140
00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:12.029 line:82%
- Buy you a drink?
- Thanks, not drinking today.

141
00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:15.824 line:82%
Vodka? Bacardi?
Petrol? Jägerbomb?

142
00:14:18.368 --> 00:14:19.411 line:82%
No French, eh?

143
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.081 line:82%
- Indian?
- I'm French. Parents Indian.

144
00:14:27.252 --> 00:14:28.253 line:82%
Sorry.

145
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.197 line:82%
I thought French might score.

146
00:14:32.089 --> 00:14:34.216 line:82%
I've tried for hours. No luck.

147
00:14:34.632 --> 00:14:36.552 line:82%
In desperation I tried French.

148
00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:40.472 line:82%
Now that's quite honest.
I'm impressed.

149
00:14:41.419 --> 00:14:44.254 line:82%
See, for something like that,
my friend, I'm gonna buy you a drink.

150
00:14:45.226 --> 00:14:46.352 line:82%
What are you having?

151
00:14:49.272 --> 00:14:51.983 line:82%
François, the same. Two.

152
00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.068 line:82%
Come on up.

153
00:14:55.433 --> 00:14:56.945 line:82%
- I'm Shyra.
- Dharam.

154
00:14:57.696 --> 00:14:59.114 line:82%
So, Desperate Dharam...

155
00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:02.242 line:82%
scan the lovelies.
Who catches your eye?

156
00:15:03.318 --> 00:15:07.080 line:82%
My eyes are stuck on you,
they won't unstick.

157
00:15:07.747 --> 00:15:10.789 line:82%
Ah! That's sweet but it's not
gonna work.

158
00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:13.961 line:82%
- Not into Indian guys.
- I can understand.

159
00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:18.590 line:82%
I'm not into Indian guys either.
I think they smell of fenugreek.

160
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:24.012 line:82%
Wicked sense of humor!
Not bad, impressed again.

161
00:15:24.846 --> 00:15:27.932 line:82%
- Are we doing this or not?
- Come! Yeah.

162
00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:31.727 line:82%
Okay, point out the girl you like.

163
00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:34.438 line:82%
I'll tell you your chances.

164
00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:41.528 line:82%
Choosy, aren't we?

165
00:15:42.352 --> 00:15:43.572 line:82%
No one?

166
00:15:44.214 --> 00:15:45.993 line:82%
They're all gorgeous.

167
00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:48.451 line:82%
But I'm stuck on you.

168
00:15:49.202 --> 00:15:50.828 line:82%
No one else will do.

169
00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:53.507 line:82%
Thank you for helping me out.

170
00:15:54.048 --> 00:15:56.500 line:82%
One drink with you
is enough for me.

171
00:15:57.358 --> 00:16:01.380 line:82%
You'll ditch me soon. So until then
let's savor the moment. Cheers!

172
00:16:02.482 --> 00:16:05.467 line:82%
Everybody, get ready for the
chicken wings contest!

173
00:16:12.682 --> 00:16:16.101 line:82%
Whoever wins by eating
the maximum amount of chicken wings

174
00:16:16.354 --> 00:16:18.729 line:82%
gets free food and drinks for a year!

175
00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:20.605 line:82%
Now you're talking!

176
00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:23.731 line:82%
You know what? I dare you!

177
00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:28.112 line:82%
You win, I party with you.

178
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.114 line:82%
Really?

179
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.495 line:82%
Delhi folk can be weak in matters
of the heart, but not in dares.

180
00:16:37.388 --> 00:16:38.388 line:82%
You're on.

181
00:16:39.414 --> 00:16:40.414 line:82%
Ok.

182
00:16:41.677 --> 00:16:44.336 line:82%
Here's a contestant!

183
00:17:40.024 --> 00:17:44.139 line:82%
Your smile is bewitching
I'm crazy about you

184
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.559 line:82%
Desire takes me over
Your voice melts me

185
00:18:05.116 --> 00:18:07.869 line:82%
The girl's like a heady drink

186
00:18:10.037 --> 00:18:12.581 line:82%
Like a soaring kite
cutting another

187
00:18:25.135 --> 00:18:28.262 line:82%
She reeled me in,
no time to cut loose

188
00:18:39.648 --> 00:18:43.944 line:82%
Like a lofty kite, a dervish entranced
In a flash I was high

189
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:46.529 line:82%
Like a shock wave,
a search warrant

190
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.948 line:82%
Like a secret download

191
00:18:49.657 --> 00:18:51.617 line:82%
The girl's like a heady drink

192
00:18:54.643 --> 00:18:56.455 line:82%
Like a soaring kite
cutting another

193
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.357 line:82%
Like new spring,
like a clean slate

194
00:19:26.774 --> 00:19:28.776 line:82%
Like cement filling
the cracks

195
00:19:29.027 --> 00:19:31.195 line:82%
Like sparring sexy eyes

196
00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.447 line:82%
Hitting the jackpot at last

197
00:19:34.323 --> 00:19:36.033 line:82%
Her name is all over my lips

198
00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.954 line:82%
She runs in my veins

199
00:19:44.124 --> 00:19:46.084 line:82%
Like a crazy tale,
she's wild youth

200
00:19:46.459 --> 00:19:48.461 line:82%
Like ice melting through
your fingers

201
00:19:48.795 --> 00:19:51.088 line:82%
Like a river flowing,
mischief smiling

202
00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:53.340 line:82%
Like a favor that's big trouble

203
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.593 line:82%
She reeled me in,
no time to cut loose

204
00:19:59.012 --> 00:20:00.889 line:82%
The girl's like a heady drink

205
00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:05.643 line:82%
Like a kite cutting another

206
00:20:19.195 --> 00:20:21.450 line:82%
Like a kite flying over rooftops

207
00:20:24.212 --> 00:20:27.163 line:82%
Crossing the crossroads
of my heart

208
00:20:29.123 --> 00:20:32.418 line:82%
Smiling she wanders,
she roams

209
00:20:34.065 --> 00:20:36.648 line:82%
She grabs my heart

210
00:20:40.008 --> 00:20:44.012 line:82%
Your smile is bewitching
I'm crazy about you

211
00:20:44.975 --> 00:20:48.808 line:82%
Desire takes me over
Your voice melts me

212
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.641 line:82%
Leaving?

213
00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:37.770 line:82%
Party's over, back to real life.

214
00:21:38.629 --> 00:21:42.569 line:82%
Without my number, how will you
call when you miss me?

215
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:46.151 line:82%
Cute!

216
00:21:49.383 --> 00:21:52.783 line:82%
You know I recently broke up.
Wanna be single for a bit.

217
00:21:53.218 --> 00:21:56.662 line:82%
In fact, I wasn't looking
to hook up last night...

218
00:21:57.238 --> 00:22:00.999 line:82%
but you got me with you goofy lines
and your sexy dance moves.

219
00:22:02.002 --> 00:22:03.293 line:82%
I just let go.

220
00:22:04.581 --> 00:22:06.671 line:82%
So no phone calls, please.

221
00:22:10.984 --> 00:22:12.510 line:82%
Leave me your number.

222
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.220 line:82%
Don't know a soul in Paris.

223
00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.556 line:82%
If I get molested or mugged,
I could call you for help.

224
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.890 line:82%
- Bonjour
- One minute, ok?

225
00:22:19.323 --> 00:22:22.477 line:82%
An Indian has a duty
to help another Indian.

226
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:24.562 line:82%
Shyra! Where's your patriotism?

227
00:22:38.025 --> 00:22:40.744 line:82%
So, she didn't like what you had?

228
00:22:41.369 --> 00:22:43.496 line:82%
What to do? She also likes girls.

229
00:22:44.095 --> 00:22:45.582 line:82%
I'm going back to India.

230
00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:49.898 line:82%
What is this?

231
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:53.146 line:82%
- Cornflakes.
- I hate cornflakes!

232
00:22:53.287 --> 00:22:55.240 line:82%
- Ok.
- Ok!

233
00:23:12.565 --> 00:23:13.565 line:82%
Hello, hi.

234
00:23:13.906 --> 00:23:16.110 line:82%
Can you tell me, which cornflake is this?

235
00:23:17.962 --> 00:23:18.966 line:82%
Follow me.

236
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:23.950 line:82%
- Here.
- So many?

237
00:23:24.531 --> 00:23:28.599 line:82%
Madam! You don't understand.
My ex girlfriend, she's crazy!

238
00:23:29.205 --> 00:23:32.500 line:82%
She takes out the cornflakes from
the box, puts in a jar...

239
00:23:32.984 --> 00:23:36.003 line:82%
throws away the box. I don't know
the name of this cornflake.

240
00:23:36.078 --> 00:23:38.256 line:82%
I can't have breakfast without it,
this is my favorite.

241
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.090 line:82%
Please tell me which is this cornfla...

242
00:23:51.392 --> 00:23:53.936 line:82%
- Sorry, we don't have this one.
- Did you have to eat it?

243
00:23:54.345 --> 00:23:56.105 line:82%
My last cornflake! Now what?

244
00:23:56.239 --> 00:23:59.399 line:82%
- You want anything else, sir?
- Poison? I want to give you a present.

245
00:24:25.767 --> 00:24:28.676 line:82%
Narrow escape, sonny.
Almost bowled out.

246
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.209 line:82%
The witch has special powers.
She sprouts up out of the air.

247
00:24:33.707 --> 00:24:35.876 line:82%
Time to chill, sonny.

248
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.534 line:82%
Hiding from me?

249
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:44.274 line:82%
It's you!

250
00:24:45.278 --> 00:24:48.027 line:82%
What brings you here?
Sorry, I didn't see you.

251
00:24:48.774 --> 00:24:49.774 line:82%
How are you?

252
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.324 line:82%
Mehra was asking after you,
you should call him sometime.

253
00:24:53.706 --> 00:24:54.706 line:82%
Cut it out, Dharam.

254
00:24:54.992 --> 00:24:57.411 line:82%
Politeness doesn't suit
Delhi boys.

255
00:24:58.078 --> 00:25:00.497 line:82%
And you don't have to run
when you see me.

256
00:25:01.931 --> 00:25:06.836 line:82%
I thought if we spoke, you'd get
a flashback of our past.

257
00:25:07.397 --> 00:25:09.964 line:82%
Look at me! Think I'm
the flashback type?

258
00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:16.428 line:82%
If we bump into each other again,
can I say hi?

259
00:25:18.287 --> 00:25:19.287 line:82%
Just hi!

260
00:25:21.525 --> 00:25:23.959 line:82%
Put them in a jar, they spoil
in the box.

261
00:25:25.377 --> 00:25:27.230 line:82%
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

262
00:25:28.815 --> 00:25:31.525 line:82%
Who's single tonight, besides me?

263
00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:34.416 line:82%
Bravo!

264
00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:39.741 line:82%
A beer from the singles for
the unlucky hooked-up guys.

265
00:25:43.296 --> 00:25:45.330 line:82%
When you're single again...

266
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:48.485 line:82%
every girl looks appealing.

267
00:26:04.222 --> 00:26:07.282 line:82%
But the girls may not
find you appealing.

268
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.727 line:82%
Only one rule to avoid being single:

269
00:26:10.173 --> 00:26:11.270 line:82%
Never give up!

270
00:26:39.343 --> 00:26:42.257 line:82%
Alcohol is not the only cure.

271
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.469 line:82%
There are healthier options:
Gardens, parks.

272
00:26:48.145 --> 00:26:51.724 line:82%
There's an old saying: "You make
girls laugh and they're yours."

273
00:26:52.297 --> 00:26:55.954 line:82%
I say: "Make kids happy,
their Moms are yours."

274
00:26:56.537 --> 00:26:58.105 line:82%
Especially single moms.

275
00:27:00.232 --> 00:27:01.733 line:82%
Antoine Griezmann!

276
00:27:06.044 --> 00:27:07.739 line:82%
Come, careful.

277
00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:17.664 line:82%
Papa's here for the night.

278
00:27:18.424 --> 00:27:20.544 line:82%
- Papa?
- He's not your Papa.

279
00:27:23.212 --> 00:27:24.870 line:82%
- You all right?
- Yeah.

280
00:27:25.285 --> 00:27:27.423 line:82%
- Hi. Dharam.
- Hi. Marie.

281
00:27:27.863 --> 00:27:29.383 line:82%
- Very nice to meet you.
- Me, too.

282
00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:31.649 line:82%
I can see where he gets his smile from.

283
00:27:32.053 --> 00:27:33.929 line:82%
Thank you very much.

284
00:27:34.418 --> 00:27:35.418 line:82%
My pleasure.

285
00:27:37.516 --> 00:27:39.559 line:82%
Long live Mommy love!

286
00:27:44.383 --> 00:27:50.027 line:82%
I love Indian food, Indian music,
everything about India.

287
00:27:50.504 --> 00:27:53.656 line:82%
I'm the most Indian thing
you'll find in Paris.

288
00:27:54.109 --> 00:27:59.661 line:82%
One hundred percent pure Indian.
Exotic, like the jungle boy Mowgli.

289
00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:03.123 line:82%
Would you like to see incredible India?

290
00:28:03.637 --> 00:28:04.637 line:82%
Tonight!

291
00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:08.339 line:82%
Tonight. At your service, madame.
Chin-chin.

292
00:28:12.165 --> 00:28:14.216 line:82%
Here's the menu. Good evening.

293
00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:23.183 line:82%
I'm so sorry. Should I show you
the men's room?

294
00:28:24.893 --> 00:28:26.436 line:82%
I'll be right back.

295
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.647 line:82%
- Where?
- This way, please.

296
00:28:36.726 --> 00:28:38.227 line:82%
Why did you have to ruin my date?

297
00:28:38.477 --> 00:28:41.230 line:82%
Zip up your jealousy. We broke up
6 months ago.

298
00:28:41.647 --> 00:28:44.975 line:82%
Have you completely lost it, Dharam?
Couldn't you find another restaurant?

299
00:28:45.067 --> 00:28:47.444 line:82%
How did I know you switched
from guide to waitress?

300
00:28:47.778 --> 00:28:49.196 line:82%
- It's Sunday night.
- So?

301
00:28:49.446 --> 00:28:52.449 line:82%
So, I help my parents on Sundays.
Remember?

302
00:28:53.366 --> 00:28:56.619 line:82%
- Is this your Dad's restaurant?
- Thought I flipped seeing your date?

303
00:28:56.873 --> 00:28:58.896 line:82%
- Wasn't it the "Indian Summer?"
- Name change.

304
00:28:58.981 --> 00:29:00.539 line:82%
But why? It was doing ok.

305
00:29:00.831 --> 00:29:03.792 line:82%
- The chutney was bland, but...
- That's not...

306
00:29:04.668 --> 00:29:05.794 line:82%
...the point. Goddamnit!

307
00:29:06.128 --> 00:29:09.464 line:82%
If my parents see you here
on a date, they'll freak out.

308
00:29:10.006 --> 00:29:12.217 line:82%
Our breakup still upsets them.

309
00:29:12.486 --> 00:29:14.802 line:82%
Indian parents are too sentimental.

310
00:29:15.595 --> 00:29:17.680 line:82%
Baby, what about table number 18?

311
00:29:34.362 --> 00:29:35.488 line:82%
Bless me, uncle.

312
00:29:37.532 --> 00:29:38.783 line:82%
Bless me, auntie.

313
00:29:44.872 --> 00:29:47.499 line:82%
- He came to apologize?
- No, Mum. He's on a date.

314
00:29:53.004 --> 00:29:54.631 line:82%
On a date?

315
00:29:55.298 --> 00:29:59.051 line:82%
Scumbag! I could shove
a skewer up his...

316
00:30:02.012 --> 00:30:04.765 line:82%
Bad service, bad restaurant,
my bad.

317
00:30:05.182 --> 00:30:07.225 line:82%
I'm a bad boy, punish me.
Come, let's go.

318
00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:09.811 line:82%
- This is our specialty.
- Thank you.

319
00:30:12.313 --> 00:30:15.358 line:82%
You may be my ex, but you've no right
to run Dad's restaurant down.

320
00:30:15.733 --> 00:30:17.777 line:82%
- It's delicious.
- Thank you.

321
00:30:18.361 --> 00:30:19.445 line:82%
So you mean...

322
00:30:19.945 --> 00:30:22.740 line:82%
you have no problem with me
eating here?

323
00:30:23.157 --> 00:30:25.701 line:82%
I mean my ex serving my new girlfriend?

324
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:27.034 line:82%
No.

325
00:30:28.245 --> 00:30:30.246 line:82%
You really are French.

326
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:32.082 line:82%
Always was.

327
00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:36.210 line:82%
- I'm Shyra.
- Delighted. I'm Marie.

328
00:30:36.544 --> 00:30:39.088 line:82%
- We lived together ages ago.
- I see.

329
00:30:39.714 --> 00:30:41.715 line:82%
Shyra and me are good friends.
Old friends.

330
00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:44.843 line:82%
Don't overdo it.
She knows you're my ex.

331
00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:47.137 line:82%
And, we were never friends.

332
00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:50.015 line:82%
We were lovers and they
can't be friends.

333
00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:53.893 line:82%
Spoken like a true Delhi boy!
Some free advice, though?

334
00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:58.272 line:82%
Don't lay it on too thick. I told her
you can't last long.

335
00:30:58.648 --> 00:31:00.274 line:82%
So typical of you!

336
00:31:01.483 --> 00:31:05.362 line:82%
She's gone mad. She's jealous.
It's cute, but you don't listen to her.

337
00:31:06.154 --> 00:31:07.447 line:82%
How's the kebab?

338
00:31:08.865 --> 00:31:10.742 line:82%
The witch must have spat on it.

339
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:12.911 line:82%
Chin-chin!

340
00:31:26.506 --> 00:31:28.813 line:82%
- Good morning, guys!
- Good morning!

341
00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:32.178 line:82%
We start our tour in the
Tuileries Garden.

342
00:31:32.554 --> 00:31:34.264 line:82%
As you can see,

343
00:31:34.514 --> 00:31:37.975 line:82%
Tuileries Garden lies between
the Place de la Concorde and the Louvre.

344
00:31:42.104 --> 00:31:45.774 line:82%
Catherine of Medici built
the Tuileries Palace in 1564.

345
00:31:46.108 --> 00:31:48.568 line:82%
France's famous cultural hub.

346
00:31:49.402 --> 00:31:51.738 line:82%
It became a public garden after
the French revolution.

347
00:31:52.072 --> 00:31:53.740 line:82%
And it's a very famous tourist spot.

348
00:31:54.073 --> 00:31:55.073 line:82%
Wow.

349
00:31:58.411 --> 00:31:59.411 line:82%
Slow down!

350
00:32:02.247 --> 00:32:03.247 line:82%
Love it!

351
00:32:05.042 --> 00:32:07.127 line:82%
- This is the Arc de Triomphe.
- Paris's India Gate.

352
00:32:07.502 --> 00:32:09.171 line:82%
This is one of the
most important avenues.

353
00:32:09.546 --> 00:32:12.257 line:82%
- Home to many celebrities.
- Like Delhi's Vasant Vihar.

354
00:32:12.715 --> 00:32:16.219 line:82%
The Notre Dame, the world's
most famous cathedral.

355
00:32:16.844 --> 00:32:17.844 line:82%
Wow!

356
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.848 line:82%
There's a beautiful story
about the Notre Dame.

357
00:32:21.182 --> 00:32:23.600 line:82%
A beautiful story.

358
00:32:24.393 --> 00:32:26.979 line:82%
The love story of Esmeralda
and Quasimodo.

359
00:32:27.854 --> 00:32:29.022 line:82%
Beautiful.

360
00:32:32.525 --> 00:32:33.818 line:82%
Happy honeymoon.

361
00:32:35.403 --> 00:32:36.404 line:82%
Thank you.

362
00:32:37.697 --> 00:32:40.116 line:82%
I'll be off, auntie. See you!
Lovely.

363
00:32:41.951 --> 00:32:42.951 line:82%
Bye!

364
00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:46.455 line:82%
Hello, hello.

365
00:32:48.498 --> 00:32:50.166 line:82%
Is our meeting a random coincidence?

366
00:32:50.458 --> 00:32:53.836 line:82%
Or is God trying to unite lovers
who were made for each other?

367
00:32:54.545 --> 00:32:56.905 line:82%
You honestly didn't know
I worked here?

368
00:32:57.423 --> 00:32:58.924 line:82%
How the hell would I know?

369
00:32:59.592 --> 00:33:02.177 line:82%
We're not in India where
two people can get lost

370
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:03.721 line:82%
and never meet again.

371
00:33:09.392 --> 00:33:14.689 line:82%
Actually, I begged barman
François to lead me to you.

372
00:33:17.608 --> 00:33:22.363 line:82%
You're forever blurting out the truth.
It makes you seem cute.

373
00:33:22.946 --> 00:33:24.031 line:82%
But I am cute.

374
00:33:24.531 --> 00:33:27.325 line:82%
Try your cuteness elsewhere.
I'm not in that headspace.

375
00:33:27.617 --> 00:33:30.036 line:82%
Not looking for any space
in your head right now,

376
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.748 line:82%
just one night, some drinks,
some dancing, some...

377
00:33:36.316 --> 00:33:39.021 line:82%
No! You'll fall in love with me.
It's just gonna get complicated.

378
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:40.504 line:82%
Are you crazy?

379
00:33:40.838 --> 00:33:44.633 line:82%
It's beyond me why people fall into
the love trap. Total time waste.

380
00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:46.593 line:82%
Come on, Shyra. Don't be a bore.

381
00:33:46.927 --> 00:33:47.927 line:82%
One night...

382
00:33:48.136 --> 00:33:51.139 line:82%
And if you don't have a good time,
I won't show my face again. Promise!

383
00:33:58.145 --> 00:33:59.730 line:82%
- Ok.
- Ok.

384
00:34:01.565 --> 00:34:03.108 line:82%
See that cop? Right there.

385
00:34:03.859 --> 00:34:04.859 line:82%
Yeah.

386
00:34:05.277 --> 00:34:09.030 line:82%
Slap him hard. I'll go out
on a date with you.

387
00:34:11.658 --> 00:34:15.495 line:82%
You don't want to date me, it's ok.
But I'm no suicide bomber.

388
00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:19.540 line:82%
I want to date you!
I just gotta know if you're worth my time.

389
00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:23.127 line:82%
He's a bloody cop. I'll get deported.

390
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:25.587 line:82%
I know. Life's a bitch.

391
00:34:32.385 --> 00:34:33.970 line:82%
You're psycho, right?

392
00:34:51.403 --> 00:34:53.863 line:82%
If I die, I won't spare you.

393
00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:21.138 line:82%
Run!

394
00:36:55.183 --> 00:36:56.851 line:82%
Carefree hearts fly free

395
00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:00.896 line:82%
Like sparks rising from embers

396
00:37:13.032 --> 00:37:14.325 line:82%
Swinging all night long

397
00:37:15.368 --> 00:37:17.078 line:82%
Touching the blue sky

398
00:37:17.578 --> 00:37:18.871 line:82%
Kissing the moon

399
00:37:19.413 --> 00:37:20.915 line:82%
Circling the stars

400
00:37:22.082 --> 00:37:23.834 line:82%
Carefree hearts fly free

401
00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.838 line:82%
Like sparks rising from embers

402
00:37:50.984 --> 00:37:52.819 line:82%
Hearts beating

403
00:37:53.027 --> 00:37:54.404 line:82%
Pulse racing - breathless

404
00:37:55.363 --> 00:37:56.989 line:82%
Eyes sparkling when they meet

405
00:38:00.034 --> 00:38:01.827 line:82%
Faltering, fluttering

406
00:38:02.244 --> 00:38:03.871 line:82%
Fumbling - breathless

407
00:38:04.496 --> 00:38:06.373 line:82%
Hands trembling when they meet

408
00:38:09.376 --> 00:38:10.710 line:82%
Rolling the dice

409
00:38:11.336 --> 00:38:12.545 line:82%
Gambling with hearts

410
00:38:13.671 --> 00:38:14.797 line:82%
Rolling the dice

411
00:38:15.548 --> 00:38:17.133 line:82%
Gambling with hearts

412
00:38:18.175 --> 00:38:19.927 line:82%
Carefree hearts fly free

413
00:38:22.554 --> 00:38:24.056 line:82%
Like sparks rising from embers

414
00:38:44.908 --> 00:38:47.702 line:82%
There's no holding them back

415
00:38:49.371 --> 00:38:51.373 line:82%
They swim in the deep end

416
00:38:53.917 --> 00:38:56.586 line:82%
Caring not if they win or lose

417
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:00.422 line:82%
Caring not if they sink or swim

418
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:04.885 line:82%
Reigning in emotions

419
00:39:05.385 --> 00:39:06.762 line:82%
is chasing clouds.

420
00:39:07.637 --> 00:39:09.389 line:82%
Desires are the whims of souls

421
00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:13.935 line:82%
Carefree hearts fly free

422
00:39:16.395 --> 00:39:17.855 line:82%
Like sparks rising from embers

423
00:40:07.567 --> 00:40:08.567 line:82%
Look, son...

424
00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.906 line:82%
We know what it means if a daughter
brings a boy home. Parents know.

425
00:40:14.554 --> 00:40:16.576 line:82%
She knows all about
Shyra's boyfriends.

426
00:40:17.058 --> 00:40:20.012 line:82%
We don't question her. This is
Paris after all, not Patiala.

427
00:40:23.016 --> 00:40:24.733 line:82%
Son, are your parents in Delhi?

428
00:40:25.052 --> 00:40:28.462 line:82%
Auntie, Mum's a housewife,
Dad was in the army.

429
00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:30.171 line:82%
I'm so sorry, son.

430
00:40:35.048 --> 00:40:40.846 line:82%
Why not call your mother?
Let's fix the wedding date.

431
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:44.268 line:82%
Relax, Mum. He's not proposing.

432
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.560 line:82%
Then?

433
00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:47.312 line:82%
He's helping me to move out.

434
00:40:47.646 --> 00:40:49.273 line:82%
Moving out? Where to?

435
00:40:49.706 --> 00:40:51.691 line:82%
- Are you leaving Paris?
- No.

436
00:40:52.085 --> 00:40:54.652 line:82%
Dharam and I have so little
time together.

437
00:40:54.944 --> 00:40:58.030 line:82%
He has his stand-up at nights,
and I work all day.

438
00:40:58.406 --> 00:41:01.033 line:82%
His roommates are moving out.
It's just more practical.

439
00:41:01.503 --> 00:41:02.503 line:82%
All good?

440
00:41:02.701 --> 00:41:03.701 line:82%
You mean...

441
00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:07.108 line:82%
you'll live together? Out of wedlock?

442
00:41:07.493 --> 00:41:09.271 line:82%
Auntie, you see...

443
00:41:09.811 --> 00:41:13.795 line:82%
if we live together, we'll find out
if we're a good fit.

444
00:41:14.149 --> 00:41:18.263 line:82%
She's my daughter,
not a free yoga class.

445
00:41:18.852 --> 00:41:21.885 line:82%
Papa, I'm not asking for permission,
I'm just letting you know.

446
00:41:22.325 --> 00:41:24.866 line:82%
Don't make a scene now.
We're 10 mins away.

447
00:41:25.232 --> 00:41:28.475 line:82%
It's not like a marriage, just a live-in.

448
00:41:33.182 --> 00:41:34.605 line:82%
I think we should leave now.

449
00:41:46.878 --> 00:41:48.685 line:82%
- "Just a live-in?"
- What does that mean?

450
00:41:49.321 --> 00:41:50.545 line:82%
Bless me, uncle.

451
00:41:52.413 --> 00:41:53.631 line:82%
Bless me, auntie.

452
00:41:55.869 --> 00:41:57.543 line:82%
Paying respect? In Paris?

453
00:42:03.298 --> 00:42:04.883 line:82%
Why did you touch their feet?

454
00:42:05.908 --> 00:42:09.763 line:82%
Didn't want them to think you're
living with a jerk.

455
00:42:10.055 --> 00:42:11.765 line:82%
Had to reassure them.

456
00:42:12.056 --> 00:42:14.892 line:82%
You overdid it. Now they're waiting
for the wedding.

457
00:42:15.268 --> 00:42:17.395 line:82%
Well can you blame them?

458
00:42:17.812 --> 00:42:20.899 line:82%
Living with a guy for the first time...
it's a biggish sort of deal, yeah?

459
00:42:21.658 --> 00:42:23.649 line:82%
We're never getting married.
Ever.

460
00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.400 line:82%
I know! Relax.

461
00:42:25.901 --> 00:42:27.569 line:82%
Think I'm dying to get married?

462
00:42:29.529 --> 00:42:30.572 line:82%
Stop the car!

463
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.775 line:82%
- Just stop the car on the side!
- What?

464
00:42:39.656 --> 00:42:42.207 line:82%
- In the middle of the road?
- Shut up!

465
00:42:43.125 --> 00:42:45.127 line:82%
- We want to live together?
- Absolutely!

466
00:42:45.451 --> 00:42:47.380 line:82%
Are we one of those stupid
coochie coo couples

467
00:42:47.504 --> 00:42:50.845 line:82%
- who go, "honey, baby, sweetie?"
- Never!

468
00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:53.176 line:82%
Why won't we say silly things
like "I love you?"

469
00:42:53.446 --> 00:42:56.071 line:82%
Because it turns all emotional,
sentimental. End of fun times.

470
00:42:56.888 --> 00:42:57.888 line:82%
Perfect.

471
00:42:59.604 --> 00:43:00.641 line:82%
Let's move in.

472
00:43:01.748 --> 00:43:02.748 line:82%
I dare you!

473
00:43:03.185 --> 00:43:04.185 line:82%
Now.

474
00:43:04.603 --> 00:43:06.521 line:82%
Right here, right now.

475
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:14.611 line:82%
You're on!

476
00:43:27.165 --> 00:43:28.208 line:82%
Dharam!

477
00:43:30.794 --> 00:43:32.879 line:82%
Dharam! Open the door.

478
00:43:33.487 --> 00:43:35.631 line:82%
Where's the fire? My game...

479
00:43:37.592 --> 00:43:39.635 line:82%
It stinks! Oh my God.

480
00:43:49.279 --> 00:43:52.105 line:82%
- What is it? The lights?
- Where's my charger?

481
00:43:52.625 --> 00:43:54.565 line:82%
Lights off! I've an early start.

482
00:43:54.899 --> 00:43:56.901 line:82%
Switch off the bloody lights, God dammit!

483
00:43:57.443 --> 00:43:59.695 line:82%
- Are you insane?
- You're too much!

484
00:43:59.987 --> 00:44:01.196 line:82%
Shyra, get up, help me.

485
00:44:02.114 --> 00:44:04.449 line:82%
The cleaner has the same phone.
She took it.

486
00:44:06.743 --> 00:44:07.744 line:82%
Who's that?

487
00:44:09.371 --> 00:44:10.497 line:82%
What are you doing?

488
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.376 line:82%
Shut the music off!
I came home at three.

489
00:44:15.835 --> 00:44:18.838 line:82%
Is this revenge for the other night?
So immature.

490
00:44:20.172 --> 00:44:21.715 line:82%
Music off! Or else...

491
00:44:22.132 --> 00:44:23.425 line:82%
You evil witch!

492
00:44:24.176 --> 00:44:25.302 line:82%
Good morning!

493
00:44:27.929 --> 00:44:29.764 line:82%
I hope you have a crap day!

494
00:44:30.849 --> 00:44:32.100 line:82%
- The keys?
- You had them.

495
00:44:32.193 --> 00:44:34.330 line:82%
Are you're kidding me?
I was just asking for the house keys.

496
00:44:34.409 --> 00:44:36.018 line:82%
- No, check.
- What do you mean check?

497
00:44:36.089 --> 00:44:39.607 line:82%
Look at the size of this bag.
There's no space for house keys!

498
00:44:41.191 --> 00:44:42.860 line:82%
You know what, just check it!

499
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.611 line:82%
Let's check it.

500
00:44:48.281 --> 00:44:50.325 line:82%
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

501
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:59.375 line:82%
Honey, I'm home.

502
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:03.128 line:82%
Mehra took me to a great place.
We ate like pigs.

503
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:06.214 line:82%
I've got acid reflux.
Expecting guests?

504
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:09.801 line:82%
- I told you I was cooking tonight.
- Wasn't that on Thursday?

505
00:45:11.845 --> 00:45:13.057 line:82%
Today is Thursday.

506
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:45.750 line:82%
Yeah?

507
00:45:45.834 --> 00:45:48.003 line:82%
Hi! You well? All good?

508
00:45:48.503 --> 00:45:51.256 line:82%
Mummy, Papa doing well?
Sorry. Am I disturbing?

509
00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:54.926 line:82%
Didn't I say? Politeness
doesn't suit you. What's up?

510
00:45:55.885 --> 00:45:57.136 line:82%
I'm at the police station.

511
00:45:59.222 --> 00:46:03.350 line:82%
Mehra is in Delhi. Who could I call
but you?

512
00:46:03.892 --> 00:46:05.769 line:82%
- Which station?
- Place Dauphine.

513
00:46:06.561 --> 00:46:07.604 line:82%
Coming.

514
00:46:08.104 --> 00:46:10.467 line:82%
Could you bring 500 euros?

515
00:46:14.539 --> 00:46:16.492 line:82%
Money coming! Ten minutes.

516
00:46:21.784 --> 00:46:22.993 line:82%
Don't hit me.

517
00:46:25.317 --> 00:46:28.623 line:82%
- Is that it? Can we go?
- Yes. You can go.

518
00:46:29.124 --> 00:46:30.750 line:82%
Very well. Thank you.

519
00:46:31.276 --> 00:46:33.795 line:82%
I paid the fine. Collect
your car tomorrow.

520
00:46:35.174 --> 00:46:37.256 line:82%
See you tomorrow. The car...

521
00:46:37.715 --> 00:46:39.914 line:82%
Merci. No thanks?

522
00:46:45.013 --> 00:46:46.139 line:82%
Thanks.

523
00:46:47.432 --> 00:46:49.226 line:82%
I'll return your money tomorrow.

524
00:46:50.524 --> 00:46:54.522 line:82%
If they catch you driving drunk
again, licence cancelled.

525
00:46:54.814 --> 00:46:55.815 line:82%
I know.

526
00:46:58.567 --> 00:47:00.194 line:82%
How come your wallet was stolen?

527
00:47:03.572 --> 00:47:06.426 line:82%
My date ran away with it.

528
00:47:09.953 --> 00:47:13.039 line:82%
- She just left with your wallet?
- Yeah.

529
00:47:25.717 --> 00:47:28.470 line:82%
- Oh God, Dharam, you're unbelievable.
- She was classy and hot.

530
00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.180 line:82%
She didn't look a criminal.

531
00:47:35.143 --> 00:47:37.645 line:82%
How come you're all alone
on a Saturday night?

532
00:47:38.437 --> 00:47:39.437 line:82%
Just...

533
00:47:39.772 --> 00:47:43.192 line:82%
I am enjoying being on my own
these days.

534
00:47:44.067 --> 00:47:45.402 line:82%
No boyfriend?

535
00:47:46.653 --> 00:47:48.071 line:82%
What can I do, Dharma?

536
00:47:48.488 --> 00:47:51.241 line:82%
Since you left, my heart
beats for no one.

537
00:47:51.533 --> 00:47:53.618 line:82%
But I have a new girlfriend
every week.

538
00:47:53.868 --> 00:47:54.868 line:82%
Is that so?

539
00:47:55.217 --> 00:47:56.871 line:82%
You started much later than me.

540
00:47:57.246 --> 00:48:00.791 line:82%
You need a lot of catching up
to become a slut like me.

541
00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:08.006 line:82%
I'm sorry, Shyra.

542
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:13.678 line:82%
I shouldn't have said all that stuff
the day we broke up.

543
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:18.724 line:82%
I was judging you because
of my lack of experience.

544
00:48:19.073 --> 00:48:20.351 line:82%
Totally uncool.

545
00:48:22.895 --> 00:48:26.314 line:82%
I wanted to apologize right away.
But I was so mad.

546
00:48:27.917 --> 00:48:29.109 line:82%
I'm sorry.

547
00:48:30.652 --> 00:48:31.971 line:82%
Forgive me.

548
00:48:40.786 --> 00:48:42.885 line:82%
When did you grow up, Dharma?

549
00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.720 line:82%
The day you left me, Ma!

550
00:48:48.472 --> 00:48:51.504 line:82%
Since you left, I haven't peed
with the toilet seat up.

551
00:48:51.963 --> 00:48:54.674 line:82%
The remotes are in one place.
I wash up before I sleep.

552
00:48:54.924 --> 00:48:56.300 line:82%
Make the bed every day.

553
00:48:56.551 --> 00:48:59.178 line:82%
And there's not a single empty
milk carton in the fridge.

554
00:48:59.553 --> 00:49:00.553 line:82%
Wow!

555
00:49:02.014 --> 00:49:03.849 line:82%
- Should I come back?
- Come.

556
00:49:05.767 --> 00:49:06.859 line:82%
I dare you!

557
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.862 line:82%
Actually, you know what?
Breaking up has reformed us.

558
00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.031 line:82%
You've learned how to say sorry,
I've stopped partying.

559
00:49:21.365 --> 00:49:23.509 line:82%
At least something good has
come out of it.

560
00:49:24.248 --> 00:49:27.287 line:82%
But you gotta admit,
it was fun while it lasted.

561
00:49:28.371 --> 00:49:29.414 line:82%
Too much fun.

562
00:49:30.081 --> 00:49:31.081 line:82%
Shyra?

563
00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:34.794 line:82%
Hi, Mum. Hi, Papa.
Late night at the restaurant?

564
00:49:35.164 --> 00:49:37.213 line:82%
Bless me, uncle.

565
00:49:38.172 --> 00:49:40.382 line:82%
Bless me, auntie.

566
00:49:42.259 --> 00:49:43.259 line:82%
Good night.

567
00:49:43.844 --> 00:49:44.887 line:82%
Thank you.

568
00:49:46.847 --> 00:49:49.307 line:82%
Are you back together?

569
00:49:49.724 --> 00:49:50.725 line:82%
No, Mum.

570
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:56.147 line:82%
Modern relationships! You're too old
to get it. Don't stress.

571
00:49:56.522 --> 00:49:57.607 line:82%
Let's go in.

572
00:50:13.121 --> 00:50:14.122 line:82%
So, Jasmine!

573
00:50:14.747 --> 00:50:18.542 line:82%
I tried dating you for a year,
how come I got lucky today?

574
00:50:20.544 --> 00:50:23.213 line:82%
Because my boyfriend is an ass.
He cheated on me.

575
00:50:24.214 --> 00:50:26.258 line:82%
Today's my birthday.
My turn to cheat.

576
00:50:27.759 --> 00:50:30.168 line:82%
I chose you because you are
a frivolous kind of a guy...

577
00:50:30.303 --> 00:50:31.888 line:82%
You're cool with this, right?

578
00:50:32.597 --> 00:50:33.597 line:82%
Right, right.

579
00:50:34.974 --> 00:50:37.226 line:82%
So happy freaking birthday to me!

580
00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:41.771 line:82%
One more.

581
00:50:43.524 --> 00:50:44.650 line:82%
Your moron?

582
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.443 line:82%
For the 100th time.

583
00:50:47.152 --> 00:50:50.113 line:82%
- No way am I taking him back.
- Absolutely not. Why should you?

584
00:50:51.406 --> 00:50:55.118 line:82%
Anyway, 11th of December? Sagittarius?

585
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.037 line:82%
My first Delhi girlfriend
was a Sagitt...

586
00:51:00.581 --> 00:51:01.832 line:82%
Is today the 11th of December?

587
00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:05.258 line:82%
May I borrow your phone?
I need to make an urgent phone call.

588
00:51:15.845 --> 00:51:18.014 line:82%
- Hello.
- Today is the 11th.

589
00:51:18.931 --> 00:51:20.307 line:82%
Whose cell is that?

590
00:51:20.599 --> 00:51:22.903 line:82%
Long story, not important.
December 11th, remember?

591
00:51:23.811 --> 00:51:26.021 line:82%
I remember 9/11.
What's with 12/11?

592
00:51:26.396 --> 00:51:29.065 line:82%
A bigger crisis than 9/11: our breakup.

593
00:51:30.734 --> 00:51:32.193 line:82%
You called to tell me this?

594
00:51:32.485 --> 00:51:34.541 line:82%
Come on, Shyra!
It's our breakup anniversary.

595
00:51:34.877 --> 00:51:37.365 line:82%
People celebrate birthdays,
wedding anniversaries

596
00:51:37.657 --> 00:51:39.533 line:82%
so can't we celebrate our breakup?

597
00:51:40.159 --> 00:51:42.369 line:82%
I really don't have time
for this stupidity.

598
00:51:42.703 --> 00:51:44.329 line:82%
I am on the night shift.

599
00:51:44.705 --> 00:51:48.083 line:82%
You finish at 9:30. See you
at the Pont des Arts at 10:00.

600
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.500 line:82%
No way.

601
00:51:49.834 --> 00:51:53.087 line:82%
Are you scared? Still haunted
by flashbacks of me?

602
00:51:53.546 --> 00:51:54.839 line:82%
You wish!

603
00:51:55.239 --> 00:51:56.889 line:82%
I've an early start. I have to leave...

604
00:51:57.008 --> 00:51:58.050 line:82%
I dare you!

605
00:52:03.555 --> 00:52:04.848 line:82%
I'll see you at 10:00.

606
00:52:11.563 --> 00:52:14.357 line:82%
All right, people.
Trocadero is to your left.

607
00:52:14.607 --> 00:52:17.318 line:82%
If anyone wants a selfie,
move to this side.

608
00:52:21.447 --> 00:52:22.447 line:82%
Hello. Sidharth?

609
00:52:22.948 --> 00:52:26.201 line:82%
Jasmine is at the Pink Flamingos,
bawling her eyes out for you.

610
00:52:26.451 --> 00:52:27.869 line:82%
Get over here now.

611
00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:30.580 line:82%
Me? I'm your lucky charm.

612
00:52:45.886 --> 00:52:49.431 line:82%
- What's this new drama, Dharam?
- No drama, just a goodbye.

613
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:52.308 line:82%
We were together for a year.

614
00:52:52.934 --> 00:52:55.269 line:82%
Our love story was like
a desi version of Titanic.

615
00:52:55.948 --> 00:53:00.816 line:82%
But the end was bad Bollywood.
Hasty, imperfect.

616
00:53:01.692 --> 00:53:04.278 line:82%
Now that we've
both moved on...

617
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.363 line:82%
You have, right?

618
00:53:06.738 --> 00:53:09.366 line:82%
Or do you still have the hots for me?

619
00:53:11.826 --> 00:53:15.538 line:82%
To celebrate the joy of
moving on, here we are

620
00:53:15.703 --> 00:53:18.624 line:82%
a year later, saying goodbye in style.

621
00:53:18.999 --> 00:53:21.502 line:82%
Let's celebrate our breakup
anniversary.

622
00:53:21.877 --> 00:53:22.961 line:82%
Alright...

623
00:53:25.839 --> 00:53:26.839 line:82%
What's the plan?

624
00:53:27.048 --> 00:53:28.925 line:82%
- Whatever you want.
- That's a first.

625
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:31.553 line:82%
You said I grew up.

626
00:53:32.554 --> 00:53:34.263 line:82%
- Shall we go to Montmartre?
- No.

627
00:53:34.764 --> 00:53:36.974 line:82%
The soft breeze, the stars,
the silent night...

628
00:53:37.391 --> 00:53:40.686 line:82%
you'll bore me with
your life's woes. Can't do it.

629
00:53:41.239 --> 00:53:42.920 line:82%
There's a new nightclub in the Marais.

630
00:53:43.139 --> 00:53:44.139 line:82%
A nightclub?

631
00:53:44.266 --> 00:53:46.691 line:82%
You'll get drunk on vodka,
dance on the table,

632
00:53:46.942 --> 00:53:49.069 line:82%
start a brawl and then
we'll get kicked out.

633
00:53:49.402 --> 00:53:52.322 line:82%
You've got a point. Drive to Lyon?

634
00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.909 line:82%
I was driving all day. Besides,
only one of us can drink.

635
00:53:57.201 --> 00:54:01.955 line:82%
Oh no! Today we have a drinking
contest. Long drive cancelled.

636
00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:04.625 line:82%
Want to see Salman's new film
at the Metro?

637
00:54:05.959 --> 00:54:08.587 line:82%
I've seen enough Hindi films
to please you.

638
00:54:08.962 --> 00:54:12.966 line:82%
Now that I'm your ex, I can pass on
those macho stunts.

639
00:54:13.299 --> 00:54:15.968 line:82%
Ok. Let's see something French
and artsy.

640
00:54:16.344 --> 00:54:18.429 line:82%
Last time, you got worked up
at the sex scene.

641
00:54:18.679 --> 00:54:20.431 line:82%
Can't do that now.

642
00:54:20.806 --> 00:54:22.808 line:82%
- I don't trust you.
- I don't trust me either.

643
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.185 line:82%
Let's hang out in your
favorite park.

644
00:54:25.798 --> 00:54:29.113 line:82%
There'll be couples making out everywhere.
We're just gonna look like fools.

645
00:54:29.314 --> 00:54:32.202 line:82%
Is there no place in Paris where
we can chat,

646
00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:34.986 line:82%
peacefully without romancing?

647
00:54:37.655 --> 00:54:40.658 line:82%
- Have we grown old?
- You sure have. A little.

648
00:54:41.909 --> 00:54:42.951 line:82%
Very funny.

649
00:54:43.639 --> 00:54:45.787 line:82%
So basically there's nothing
we can do together.

650
00:54:46.163 --> 00:54:49.165 line:82%
Or have we done everything already?

651
00:54:51.419 --> 00:54:54.212 line:82%
- We parted at the perfect time.
- Perfect.

652
00:54:56.797 --> 00:54:58.924 line:82%
Your breakup anniversary
is a bad flop.

653
00:54:59.175 --> 00:55:00.217 line:82%
No way!

654
00:55:05.597 --> 00:55:06.681 line:82%
I'll be right back.

655
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.151 line:82%
You won't leave?

656
00:55:10.894 --> 00:55:13.062 line:82%
I've already left. Forgotten?

657
00:55:25.991 --> 00:55:26.991 line:82%
Will you marry me?

658
00:55:30.412 --> 00:55:32.121 line:82%
Yes, you ass. Yes!

659
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:54.183 line:82%
One thing we haven't done together.

660
00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:55.810 line:82%
Drink beer?

661
00:55:57.478 --> 00:55:58.979 line:82%
- Padlocks are for lovers.
- I know.

662
00:55:59.188 --> 00:56:00.523 line:82%
They're banned here.

663
00:56:00.773 --> 00:56:02.483 line:82%
Do we the carefree
bother with bans?

664
00:56:02.775 --> 00:56:05.068 line:82%
No way! I was in jail once,
thanks to you.

665
00:56:05.402 --> 00:56:06.820 line:82%
- Enough.
- Listen.

666
00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.509 line:82%
This bridge was witness
to the start of our love.

667
00:56:09.649 --> 00:56:12.200 line:82%
Today it will see its end.

668
00:56:12.798 --> 00:56:16.662 line:82%
Let's clip the padlock to the bridge,
throw the key in the Seine...

669
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:20.749 line:82%
and promise never to fall
in love with each other again.

670
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.209 line:82%
Good idea?

671
00:56:23.245 --> 00:56:25.545 line:82%
The boy is older and smarter.

672
00:56:26.729 --> 00:56:28.632 line:82%
- Okay, Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

673
00:56:29.257 --> 00:56:30.592 line:82%
Lock. Yeah!

674
00:56:34.303 --> 00:56:35.303 line:82%
Look at that.

675
00:56:37.139 --> 00:56:39.100 line:82%
- There!
- My master.

676
00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.100 line:82%
You have my blessings!

677
00:56:44.333 --> 00:56:46.773 line:82%
Congrats on your breakup!

678
00:56:52.695 --> 00:56:54.781 line:82%
Miss Shyra Gill...

679
00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:57.992 line:82%
why did our love story flop?

680
00:56:58.497 --> 00:57:02.890 line:82%
Because it wasn't a love story,
it was a lust story.

681
00:57:04.794 --> 00:57:07.876 line:82%
You mean we were
lovers of lust?

682
00:57:08.627 --> 00:57:09.627 line:82%
Exactly!

683
00:57:10.513 --> 00:57:14.173 line:82%
We were in lust. But we mistook it
for love.

684
00:57:14.704 --> 00:57:18.886 line:82%
Before we got to know each other,
we started bickering about nothing.

685
00:57:19.491 --> 00:57:23.640 line:82%
If we were friends first, we'd be
more forgiving of our flaws.

686
00:57:24.148 --> 00:57:28.728 line:82%
Then our love would have
had a better chance.

687
00:57:32.067 --> 00:57:33.358 line:82%
So what are we now?

688
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.277 line:82%
I mean, we're not lovers?

689
00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:38.820 line:82%
Not enemies?

690
00:57:40.698 --> 00:57:42.700 line:82%
So, who am I to you?

691
00:57:45.758 --> 00:57:48.038 line:82%
I think now we're friends.

692
00:57:51.375 --> 00:57:52.458 line:82%
Friends?

693
00:57:54.168 --> 00:57:55.171 line:82%
You mean...

694
00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:58.589 line:82%
I'm my ex-girlfriend's friend?

695
00:58:02.122 --> 00:58:03.635 line:82%
You finally made me French.

696
00:58:04.595 --> 00:58:07.431 line:82%
Ok, Mr. Frenchy, let's see what
you've got.

697
00:58:08.181 --> 00:58:09.181 line:82%
Come on.

698
00:59:04.898 --> 00:59:06.942 line:82%
Wet shoes flung about

699
00:59:07.234 --> 00:59:08.985 line:82%
It's you and me

700
00:59:09.986 --> 00:59:12.030 line:82%
No coffee in the coffee jar

701
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.032 line:82%
It's you and me

702
00:59:14.991 --> 00:59:17.159 line:82%
That silly umbrella never opens

703
00:59:17.677 --> 00:59:19.328 line:82%
It's you and me

704
00:59:20.412 --> 00:59:24.208 line:82%
That window never closes
It's you and me

705
00:59:24.791 --> 00:59:28.962 line:82%
Our life is topsy-turvy
like our friendship

706
00:59:29.879 --> 00:59:34.217 line:82%
Upside down but seems
right side up

707
00:59:35.343 --> 00:59:37.303 line:82%
We shop and no taxi in sight

708
00:59:37.595 --> 00:59:39.013 line:82%
It's you and me

709
00:59:40.472 --> 00:59:44.434 line:82%
We walk, shoe strap snaps
It's you and me

710
00:59:45.602 --> 00:59:49.022 line:82%
The traffic is at standstill
It's you and me

711
00:59:50.648 --> 00:59:53.276 line:82%
The bus takes ages to show

712
00:59:54.277 --> 00:59:55.570 line:82%
You and me

713
01:00:16.047 --> 01:00:18.507 line:82%
When the path ahead
seems thorny

714
01:00:19.842 --> 01:00:22.261 line:82%
Or changes shape and size

715
01:00:23.303 --> 01:00:25.305 line:82%
Or feels just like a swamp

716
01:00:26.181 --> 01:00:27.224 line:82%
Smile!

717
01:00:27.516 --> 01:00:31.561 line:82%
Spread your arms wide,
breathe in the fresh air

718
01:00:33.479 --> 01:00:35.022 line:82%
It's free!

719
01:00:37.024 --> 01:00:40.694 line:82%
Wandering sailors, lost mariners

720
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:45.615 line:82%
Ever-ready to sail the rough seas,
turning the tide as we go

721
01:00:47.117 --> 01:00:48.660 line:82%
A little nuts

722
01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:51.412 line:82%
A little wise

723
01:00:52.205 --> 01:00:53.706 line:82%
We're old-time sinners

724
01:00:54.248 --> 01:00:55.458 line:82%
Lovers of life

725
01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:58.669 line:82%
Stumbling along the path

726
01:00:59.253 --> 01:01:00.879 line:82%
It's you and me

727
01:01:01.797 --> 01:01:05.550 line:82%
Smiling through life
It's you and me

728
01:01:06.843 --> 01:01:08.762 line:82%
Frozen and melting

729
01:01:09.179 --> 01:01:11.097 line:82%
It's you and me

730
01:01:11.973 --> 01:01:13.641 line:82%
Done and undone

731
01:01:14.183 --> 01:01:15.977 line:82%
It's you and me

732
01:01:16.727 --> 01:01:20.773 line:82%
Our life is topsy-turvy
like our friendship

733
01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:25.610 line:82%
Upside down but seems
right side up

734
01:01:55.638 --> 01:01:56.806 line:82%
- Yeah?
- What's up?

735
01:01:56.999 --> 01:01:58.000 line:82%
Getting ready.

736
01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:00.894 line:82%
- Meet me downstairs.
- Where are we going?

737
01:02:01.602 --> 01:02:04.187 line:82%
Babe, t's Friday night!
Deadpool 2 come out today.

738
01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:06.440 line:82%
I completely forgot.

739
01:02:07.592 --> 01:02:09.359 line:82%
So why were you dolling up?

740
01:02:09.901 --> 01:02:10.901 line:82%
I have a date.

741
01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:12.361 line:82%
You have a what?

742
01:02:12.779 --> 01:02:15.296 line:82%
Kim's idea. He works in her office.

743
01:02:15.637 --> 01:02:18.602 line:82%
I finally agreed. Why not?

744
01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.830 line:82%
Hell, no! Shyra, who can I go with?
Make an excuse and cancel.

745
01:02:23.497 --> 01:02:27.334 line:82%
I'm not in the mood, but if
I cancel now, it'd be rude.

746
01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:30.462 line:82%
You had to choose tonight to go
on a date.

747
01:02:30.712 --> 01:02:31.796 line:82%
Who's the loser?

748
01:02:32.046 --> 01:02:34.424 line:82%
He's not a loser. He's a hotshot
investment banker.

749
01:02:34.674 --> 01:02:36.425 line:82%
If he's dating you,
he gotta be a loser.

750
01:02:36.676 --> 01:02:38.636 line:82%
This "investment banker"
will bore you to bits.

751
01:02:39.053 --> 01:02:41.347 line:82%
He works at Citibank. Kim's boss.

752
01:02:41.638 --> 01:02:42.973 line:82%
She thinks he's perfect for me.

753
01:02:43.307 --> 01:02:45.151 line:82%
Have a glass of wine
and send him packing.

754
01:02:46.643 --> 01:02:49.319 line:82%
- I was silly saying yes.
- Think community service.

755
01:02:49.511 --> 01:02:52.023 line:82%
Take him to a bar. I'll call you
in ten minutes.

756
01:02:52.315 --> 01:02:55.860 line:82%
Say there's an emergency, a friend
is in hospital. Bye bye, later.

757
01:02:56.277 --> 01:03:00.155 line:82%
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
Where will you be? What if he sees you?

758
01:03:00.447 --> 01:03:02.574 line:82%
Ms. Dumbo, how will he know me?
I'll be at the bar.

759
01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.286 line:82%
- He's here.
- No, it's me.

760
01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:09.872 line:82%
Bonsoir!

761
01:03:10.498 --> 01:03:11.498 line:82%
Bonsoir!

762
01:03:13.418 --> 01:03:15.044 line:82%
No laundry today, thanks.

763
01:03:15.419 --> 01:03:16.754 line:82%
Give me two minutes.

764
01:03:17.838 --> 01:03:18.838 line:82%
Hi!

765
01:03:21.633 --> 01:03:24.011 line:82%
- Where to?
- Wherever. It's only for one drink.

766
01:03:24.344 --> 01:03:26.471 line:82%
In fact, I can't have a late night
either.

767
01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:28.265 line:82%
Have an early start.

768
01:03:28.807 --> 01:03:32.810 line:82%
And you might get a call from
a friend. Hospital...emergency.

769
01:03:35.897 --> 01:03:39.751 line:82%
- Ok, bye. I'll see you guys later...
- Aren't you coming with us?

770
01:03:40.075 --> 01:03:43.403 line:82%
- It's Friday. I'm fasting.
- Think community service.

771
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:48.395 line:82%
Guys, relax, it's cool.
I'm Anay, the boring banker.

772
01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.407 line:82%
I'm sorry.

773
01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:52.327 line:82%
"Sorry?"

774
01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:55.540 line:82%
Never heard that name before.
Your parents must've thought hard.

775
01:03:56.536 --> 01:03:58.125 line:82%
- Shyra.
- Hi, Shyra.

776
01:03:58.584 --> 01:03:59.584 line:82%
Dharam.

777
01:03:59.876 --> 01:04:03.088 line:82%
Call me whatever you want.
I deserve punishment.

778
01:04:03.463 --> 01:04:06.716 line:82%
Your punishment? You'll party
with this boring banker.

779
01:04:07.146 --> 01:04:08.718 line:82%
There's a karaoke bar in Belleville.

780
01:04:09.098 --> 01:04:11.387 line:82%
A Bollywood night.
You guys sing well?

781
01:04:12.222 --> 01:04:13.222 line:82%
No?

782
01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:16.017 line:82%
Perfect. I'm a lousy singer too.
Let's go.

783
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.868 line:82%
Guys, guys, guys!

784
01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:08.662 line:82%
That's me.

785
01:06:09.855 --> 01:06:12.228 line:82%
- Don't go.
- Have to, man.

786
01:06:13.093 --> 01:06:14.902 line:82%
Thank you so much. I had a blast.

787
01:06:15.419 --> 01:06:16.919 line:82%
Brought back my college days.

788
01:06:19.022 --> 01:06:21.507 line:82%
- It's lovely meeting you, Shyra.
- Ditto.

789
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.387 line:82%
Dharam, my brother!
You're a rock star.

790
01:06:27.721 --> 01:06:29.723 line:82%
Sorry for screwing up your date.

791
01:06:30.056 --> 01:06:33.122 line:82%
Thanks to you, I serenaded
a girl for the first time ever...

792
01:06:33.495 --> 01:06:37.146 line:82%
and a lovely one, too. No date
could be as memorable.

793
01:06:37.796 --> 01:06:38.981 line:82%
Thank you, my friend.

794
01:06:41.608 --> 01:06:42.818 line:82%
Good night.

795
01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:02.795 line:82%
He's not going to look back.

796
01:07:03.749 --> 01:07:05.839 line:82%
Waiting for someone to look back
is so 90s.

797
01:07:06.248 --> 01:07:08.216 line:82%
I was just checking out his ass.

798
01:07:08.967 --> 01:07:09.967 line:82%
Cute, no?

799
01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:12.010 line:82%
Really?

800
01:07:14.736 --> 01:07:17.016 line:82%
I haven't partied like that in a year!
I had a blast.

801
01:07:17.475 --> 01:07:19.059 line:82%
The banker is a cool guy.

802
01:07:19.393 --> 01:07:21.937 line:82%
Cool, decent and fun.
A rare combination.

803
01:07:22.509 --> 01:07:23.814 line:82%
Come to think of it,

804
01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:27.108 line:82%
he's everything you
wanted me to be.

805
01:07:28.068 --> 01:07:29.235 line:82%
Hook him!

806
01:07:29.983 --> 01:07:32.822 line:82%
He was my date, but you're
the one swooning.

807
01:07:33.601 --> 01:07:37.044 line:82%
Ok. You stay cool. But if he
throws you a line, grab it.

808
01:07:39.212 --> 01:07:41.647 line:82%
I'm done with the whole
"hooking up, breaking up" thing.

809
01:07:42.138 --> 01:07:45.792 line:82%
I want to stop. Be still.
Stay in one place.

810
01:07:47.043 --> 01:07:48.545 line:82%
You're scaring me.

811
01:07:50.171 --> 01:07:54.255 line:82%
I'm scared too. I feel as though
I've finally grown up.

812
01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.595 line:82%
I don't want to be stupid anymore.

813
01:07:59.188 --> 01:08:01.473 line:82%
So when will I get this
"grown up" feeling?

814
01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:07.279 line:82%
Not in this lifetime for sure.
But you know what? Don't lose heart!

815
01:08:07.628 --> 01:08:11.075 line:82%
Guys like you are assured a rebirth
to repent for all your sins.

816
01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:15.820 line:82%
- You've sinned more than me, witch.
- But I paid for them by being with you.

817
01:08:16.423 --> 01:08:18.197 line:82%
Now I get it.

818
01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:22.117 line:82%
So all the boyfriends before me
were your sins.

819
01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:26.388 line:82%
And I, your atonement.
Anay, your reward.

820
01:08:26.845 --> 01:08:27.998 line:82%
Exactly!

821
01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:30.125 line:82%
I don't believe it.

822
01:08:30.894 --> 01:08:32.585 line:82%
I'm your atonement?

823
01:08:33.129 --> 01:08:36.214 line:82%
- That's worse than sin.
- Get over it!

824
01:08:37.742 --> 01:08:40.939 line:82%
Walk home alone.
Hope you're mugged.

825
01:08:43.929 --> 01:08:45.472 line:82%
Shyra, wait!

826
01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.419 line:82%
Bonjour. Paris Sidewalks.
Can I help you?

827
01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.823 line:82%
May I speak to Ms. Sunidhi Chauhan?

828
01:08:54.153 --> 01:08:56.215 line:82%
- Pardon?
- Sonu Nigam here.

829
01:08:57.121 --> 01:08:58.121 line:82%
Anay!

830
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.844 line:82%
You remember my name.
That's a good sign.

831
01:09:01.562 --> 01:09:03.388 line:82%
I had a good time last night.

832
01:09:03.847 --> 01:09:06.349 line:82%
Your pal Dharam is nuts. He's mad.

833
01:09:06.724 --> 01:09:08.643 line:82%
He has a crush on you too.

834
01:09:09.018 --> 01:09:11.687 line:82%
If you want to get rid of me,
give me his number...

835
01:09:12.275 --> 01:09:14.356 line:82%
I'll try my luck with him.

836
01:09:16.193 --> 01:09:18.062 line:82%
Seriously, Shyra, I really like you.

837
01:09:19.049 --> 01:09:22.802 line:82%
If you don't think I'm an
avoidable boring banker,

838
01:09:23.974 --> 01:09:25.478 line:82%
let me take you out next week.

839
01:09:27.986 --> 01:09:29.112 line:82%
Next month?

840
01:09:30.488 --> 01:09:31.864 line:82%
How about next year?

841
01:09:32.865 --> 01:09:33.865 line:82%
Tonight?

842
01:09:37.494 --> 01:09:40.247 line:82%
Tonight? I can't. I have a date.
I'm sorry.

843
01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:44.626 line:82%
I'm kidding! Pick you up at 8.

844
01:09:45.543 --> 01:09:46.543 line:82%
Ok.

845
01:09:56.804 --> 01:09:58.097 line:82%
Off to Disneyland?

846
01:10:02.642 --> 01:10:04.728 line:82%
Yes? Looks hot, right?

847
01:10:06.271 --> 01:10:07.271 line:82%
Did someone die?

848
01:10:10.691 --> 01:10:11.776 line:82%
Hello!

849
01:10:12.401 --> 01:10:14.612 line:82%
Meeting in a restaurant?
Or booked a hotel room?

850
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:17.239 line:82%
- Idiot.
- Please change.

851
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:22.410 line:82%
Perfect!

852
01:10:26.206 --> 01:10:27.206 line:82%
Enjoy!

853
01:10:51.979 --> 01:10:53.564 line:82%
So, did you have sex?

854
01:10:53.856 --> 01:10:56.066 line:82%
- Dharam, it was our first date.
- So what?

855
01:10:56.442 --> 01:10:58.694 line:82%
On our first date you rocked
the Eiffel Tower.

856
01:10:59.027 --> 01:11:02.364 line:82%
- That's why we're just friends today.
- Oh, this is the forever guy.

857
01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:05.367 line:82%
Is that why you're being so
goody-goody with Mr. Banker?

858
01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:08.328 line:82%
- Shut up.
- Did you kiss?

859
01:11:08.619 --> 01:11:10.663 line:82%
No, he's not a pervert like you.
He's a gentleman!

860
01:11:10.955 --> 01:11:11.998 line:82%
Oh God, what a loser!

861
01:11:12.832 --> 01:11:16.085 line:82%
So you just whispered
sweet nothings in his ear?

862
01:11:16.752 --> 01:11:17.752 line:82%
How sweet!

863
01:11:18.462 --> 01:11:20.130 line:82%
You're giving me diabetes.

864
01:11:20.464 --> 01:11:21.506 line:82%
Oh, get lost.

865
01:11:23.758 --> 01:11:27.387 line:82%
The girl who fell into my cornflakes...

866
01:11:45.653 --> 01:11:49.407 line:82%
Every time I go to the opera,
it feels like the first time.

867
01:11:50.116 --> 01:11:51.576 line:82%
I can't explain it but...

868
01:11:52.243 --> 01:11:54.453 line:82%
Am I boring you?

869
01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.082 line:82%
Not at all. You know so much
about the opera.

870
01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:02.085 line:82%
In fact, if you hadn't explained,
it would've bored me.

871
01:12:05.547 --> 01:12:06.923 line:82%
I like you, Shyra.

872
01:12:10.384 --> 01:12:11.886 line:82%
I really like you.

873
01:12:30.486 --> 01:12:33.280 line:82%
So no kissy-wissy last night?

874
01:12:33.739 --> 01:12:34.739 line:82%
No.

875
01:12:34.949 --> 01:12:37.076 line:82%
I hope this banker isn't gay?

876
01:12:37.743 --> 01:12:39.536 line:82%
You better find out.

877
01:12:39.911 --> 01:12:41.496 line:82%
You're finally serious
about a guy...

878
01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:44.499 line:82%
don't want you crying on
my shoulder, wetting my t-shirt.

879
01:12:44.874 --> 01:12:47.252 line:82%
- He's not gay.
- How do you know?

880
01:12:48.711 --> 01:12:52.256 line:82%
You would know. You have
a lifetime of experience.

881
01:12:53.716 --> 01:12:56.093 line:82%
So it's the opera every Friday?

882
01:12:56.844 --> 01:12:59.471 line:82%
What about our Friday movie night?
That's damn gay.

883
01:13:00.013 --> 01:13:01.431 line:82%
That's very rude.

884
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:02.922 line:82%
Not you!

885
01:13:03.343 --> 01:13:05.894 line:82%
- You ant to go to a movie Friday night?
- I don't think so.

886
01:13:06.352 --> 01:13:07.478 line:82%
You want ball?

887
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:34.795 line:82%
Anay, my man.

888
01:13:35.129 --> 01:13:37.381 line:82%
Dharam, my man. Am I disturbing?

889
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:39.299 line:82%
I have a rule.

890
01:13:39.925 --> 01:13:43.845 line:82%
Never work so hard that
a friend would disturb you.

891
01:13:44.471 --> 01:13:48.891 line:82%
Nice. Need a favour. Can you
gatecrash my date again?

892
01:13:49.308 --> 01:13:52.311 line:82%
Of course. That's my specialty.

893
01:13:53.312 --> 01:13:54.813 line:82%
When and where?

894
01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:59.193 line:82%
I have a yacht in Cannes. I'd like
Shyra to come for the weekend.

895
01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:03.071 line:82%
Come with us, it'll be fun. And
Shyra will feel more comfortable.

896
01:14:03.697 --> 01:14:06.616 line:82%
You must have a special friend.
Bring her too.

897
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.493 line:82%
Of course, of course.

898
01:14:08.785 --> 01:14:10.953 line:82%
My special friend and I'll be there.

899
01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:13.956 line:82%
Great! I'll text you the time
and place.

900
01:14:14.331 --> 01:14:15.624 line:82%
Awesome!

901
01:14:17.167 --> 01:14:18.293 line:82%
You like French music?

902
01:14:19.211 --> 01:14:21.505 line:82%
I like French girls who like
French music.

903
01:15:33.877 --> 01:15:35.614 line:82%
Baby, I love your skin.

904
01:15:36.118 --> 01:15:38.492 line:82%
So nice and silky!

905
01:15:39.139 --> 01:15:41.750 line:82%
You know, you're like French rasmalai.

906
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:43.580 line:82%
- You know "rasmalai?"
- No.

907
01:15:43.969 --> 01:15:45.667 line:82%
It's like...mille-feuille.

908
01:15:58.106 --> 01:16:00.191 line:82%
New bikini for new boyfriend?

909
01:16:01.019 --> 01:16:04.445 line:82%
Your Miss Playboy is here, so I'd
better put up a good fight.

910
01:16:04.996 --> 01:16:05.996 line:82%
Hot, no?

911
01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:09.158 line:82%
- Do you ever talk or just...
- I have you for talking.

912
01:16:09.353 --> 01:16:10.380 line:82%
Oh, yeah. Right.

913
01:16:10.492 --> 01:16:13.537 line:82%
I have only one life.
Can't blow it talking.

914
01:16:13.954 --> 01:16:15.789 line:82%
Guys, ice-lollies.

915
01:16:16.081 --> 01:16:17.165 line:82%
- I want one!
- Cool!

916
01:16:17.457 --> 01:16:18.750 line:82%
Give me one.

917
01:16:19.194 --> 01:16:20.520 line:82%
Give me the other one, actually.

918
01:16:20.752 --> 01:16:22.378 line:82%
Baby, you want an ice-lolly?

919
01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:25.131 line:82%
I can't. I have a Vogue shoot
on Monday.

920
01:16:25.464 --> 01:16:26.840 line:82%
A Vogue shoot on Monday?

921
01:16:27.132 --> 01:16:30.219 line:82%
Poor girl. She's a model.
I'll take both.

922
01:17:10.339 --> 01:17:14.301 line:82%
- Come!
- I don't know how to swim, baby.

923
01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.513 line:82%
Hey, Shyra. Can you please
explain to her in French?

924
01:17:18.888 --> 01:17:22.892 line:82%
- Come on! It's only a Jet Ski.
- Dharam, I'll save you.

925
01:17:37.614 --> 01:17:38.614 line:82%
Mama...

926
01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.759 line:82%
I hope you're not bored
with the boring banker.

927
01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:03.012 line:82%
Because the banker is bored stiff.

928
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.192 line:82%
Good night, Shyra.

929
01:18:12.145 --> 01:18:13.355 line:82%
I better go.

930
01:18:28.285 --> 01:18:30.037 line:82%
Oh, what a gentleman.

931
01:18:32.205 --> 01:18:33.205 line:82%
Round 2.

932
01:18:34.416 --> 01:18:35.875 line:82%
What an idiot!

933
01:19:36.389 --> 01:19:39.809 line:82%
"Shyra, please meet me at 8:00
at the top of the Eiffel Tower.

934
01:19:40.393 --> 01:19:41.911 line:82%
Something very important.

935
01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:45.231 line:82%
Wear that blue dress
I bought you, please.

936
01:19:45.689 --> 01:19:47.024 line:82%
Love you. See you there."

937
01:20:43.826 --> 01:20:47.454 line:82%
Shyra, I live in the modern world
but I'm old-fashioned.

938
01:20:47.955 --> 01:20:51.917 line:82%
I follow the traditional path
when taking life decisions.

939
01:20:52.459 --> 01:20:56.629 line:82%
Oxford-educated, work in an old
finance company and now...

940
01:20:58.088 --> 01:20:59.912 line:82%
romancing at the top
of the Eiffel Tower.

941
01:21:01.008 --> 01:21:02.218 line:82%
I know it's a cliché.

942
01:21:04.178 --> 01:21:05.471 line:82%
But it's classic...

943
01:21:06.388 --> 01:21:09.809 line:82%
and beautiful...just like you.

944
01:21:11.078 --> 01:21:15.897 line:82%
I know it's the live-in age. Couples
try it out before the big leap.

945
01:21:16.981 --> 01:21:19.859 line:82%
But I don't need time to choose
my life partner.

946
01:21:21.569 --> 01:21:25.865 line:82%
I'm a banker, so I know a good
investment when I see one.

947
01:21:28.033 --> 01:21:29.785 line:82%
So Miss Shyra Gill...

948
01:21:36.374 --> 01:21:37.584 line:82%
will you marry me?

949
01:22:02.565 --> 01:22:03.607 line:82%
WITCH.

950
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:09.690 line:82%
I can't talk right now, call tomorrow.

951
01:22:09.863 --> 01:22:11.740 line:82%
Meet me at the Place des Vosges.

952
01:22:13.074 --> 01:22:18.121 line:82%
Shyra, I'm in a highly sensitive
position right now. Can't leave.

953
01:22:18.496 --> 01:22:20.998 line:82%
I don't care, Dharam Gulati.
15 minutes!

954
01:22:44.854 --> 01:22:48.232 line:82%
If it's anything less than cancer,
I'll kill you myself.

955
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:51.443 line:82%
I sacrificed the hottest moment
of my life for you.

956
01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:57.532 line:82%
- Anay proposed to me.
- Proposed, as in...?

957
01:22:58.324 --> 01:22:59.659 line:82%
Marriage?

958
01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:18.218 line:82%
Do you think I'm a girl someone
can spend a lifetime with?

959
01:23:21.304 --> 01:23:23.472 line:82%
I don't know why I'm asking you.

960
01:23:24.932 --> 01:23:27.976 line:82%
No one has spent as much time
with me as you.

961
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.730 line:82%
I never lived with anyone else.

962
01:23:38.569 --> 01:23:41.531 line:82%
I never felt scared getting into
a relationship before.

963
01:23:43.199 --> 01:23:46.744 line:82%
I didn't believe any relationship
was forever.

964
01:23:49.371 --> 01:23:51.498 line:82%
But a marriage is forever, right?

965
01:23:52.666 --> 01:23:54.918 line:82%
I have often failed in love.

966
01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.297 line:82%
I don't want to fail in marriage.

967
01:24:06.553 --> 01:24:08.222 line:82%
I'll tell you a little secret.

968
01:24:09.431 --> 01:24:13.602 line:82%
This forever kind of love is an idea
you girls are born with.

969
01:24:14.102 --> 01:24:17.116 line:82%
And you'd just have to wait
for the right guy to show up.

970
01:24:17.856 --> 01:24:22.151 line:82%
But till now you've only met lusty fools
like me. How could you think "forever?"

971
01:24:22.818 --> 01:24:27.156 line:82%
Now the right guy has finally
shown up.

972
01:24:28.574 --> 01:24:29.992 line:82%
Don't overthink it.

973
01:24:30.701 --> 01:24:32.452 line:82%
Anay is perfect for you.

974
01:24:33.787 --> 01:24:36.289 line:82%
And he couldn't dream of
a better life-partner.

975
01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:39.035 line:82%
It's Dharam's guarantee!
You're 24-hour entertainment.

976
01:24:39.167 --> 01:24:41.085 line:82%
He'll never get bored.

977
01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:43.379 line:82%
Just say yes.

978
01:24:45.339 --> 01:24:47.132 line:82%
No chance you'll fail.

979
01:24:53.889 --> 01:24:55.015 line:82%
I can't believe

980
01:24:55.265 --> 01:24:57.976 line:82%
I'm asking you for advice in making
my biggest decision.

981
01:25:02.146 --> 01:25:05.316 line:82%
- I'll be finished.
- Not really. You'll just get fat.

982
01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:09.027 line:82%
You'll walk in the park
with a milk bottle in one hand

983
01:25:09.278 --> 01:25:11.613 line:82%
and a stroller in the other! What a life!

984
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:16.117 line:82%
I'm kidding!

985
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:18.411 line:82%
You'll be just fine.

986
01:25:19.829 --> 01:25:21.831 line:82%
Mr. Citibank will keep you happy.

987
01:25:22.373 --> 01:25:24.375 line:82%
Open your account with him.

988
01:25:27.294 --> 01:25:29.463 line:82%
Marriage! Intense.

989
01:25:30.547 --> 01:25:33.008 line:82%
It's forever, like a tattoo.

990
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:40.681 line:82%
- Thank you.
- Thank you?

991
01:25:43.267 --> 01:25:45.936 line:82%
I needed reassurance from someone
who knows me.

992
01:25:46.395 --> 01:25:47.730 line:82%
You're welcome, Ma.

993
01:25:55.779 --> 01:25:57.655 line:82%
If I die, I won't spare you.

994
01:25:58.156 --> 01:25:59.991 line:82%
Don't. I'll be right here.

995
01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:43.572 line:82%
It's final? We'll never say
I love you, right?

996
01:26:43.823 --> 01:26:45.074 line:82%
- Right.
- Cool.

997
01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:47.843 line:82%
How do you say: "Never say
I love you" in French?

998
01:26:48.003 --> 01:26:50.333 line:82%
"Ne dis jamais je t'aime."

999
01:26:50.621 --> 01:26:54.291 line:82%
"Ne dis jamais je t'aime."
Ah! So sexy!

1000
01:27:06.343 --> 01:27:10.180 line:82%
Never say I love you,
never say je t'aime

1001
01:27:14.226 --> 01:27:17.729 line:82%
Never say you're in love

1002
01:27:18.396 --> 01:27:20.898 line:82%
Never say je t'aime

1003
01:27:22.066 --> 01:27:25.152 line:82%
Your heart will desert you

1004
01:27:26.028 --> 01:27:28.572 line:82%
Go easy on yourself

1005
01:27:29.948 --> 01:27:33.326 line:82%
You won't sleep at nights

1006
01:27:33.869 --> 01:27:36.162 line:82%
Go easy on yourself

1007
01:27:38.081 --> 01:27:41.751 line:82%
Never say I love you,
never say je t'aime

1008
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:49.007 line:82%
Never say you're in love

1009
01:27:49.925 --> 01:27:52.177 line:82%
Never say je t'aime

1010
01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:13.363 line:82%
You'll end up weeping,
losing your friend too

1011
01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:16.741 line:82%
Don't. No, don't say those words

1012
01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:21.037 line:82%
Why sleep on a bed of thorns
for no reason?

1013
01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:24.665 line:82%
Don't. No, don't say those words

1014
01:28:25.082 --> 01:28:28.419 line:82%
Your breath will freeze on your lips

1015
01:28:29.002 --> 01:28:31.171 line:82%
I promise you

1016
01:28:32.964 --> 01:28:36.051 line:82%
You'll be all tied up in knots

1017
01:28:36.885 --> 01:28:39.262 line:82%
Go easy on yourself

1018
01:28:41.222 --> 01:28:44.517 line:82%
Never say I love you,
never say je t'aime

1019
01:28:48.687 --> 01:28:52.190 line:82%
Don't. No, don't say those words

1020
01:29:13.251 --> 01:29:15.378 line:82%
A girl calls you 24/7.

1021
01:29:17.255 --> 01:29:19.590 line:82%
Shall I buy this phone? You advise.

1022
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:22.551 line:82%
What should I wear? You suggest.

1023
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:24.804 line:82%
Her car breaks down. You fix it.

1024
01:29:26.222 --> 01:29:27.264 line:82%
Meaning...

1025
01:29:27.931 --> 01:29:30.309 line:82%
her life cannot function
without you.

1026
01:29:31.977 --> 01:29:35.271 line:82%
She's the heroine, you her hero.

1027
01:29:38.816 --> 01:29:40.276 line:82%
Then one fine day...

1028
01:29:41.319 --> 01:29:43.988 line:82%
another guy enters her life.

1029
01:29:45.614 --> 01:29:47.449 line:82%
You realize that

1030
01:29:47.825 --> 01:29:50.619 line:82%
the real hero is another man.

1031
01:29:51.828 --> 01:29:53.788 line:82%
You're the supporting act,
the side hero.

1032
01:29:58.376 --> 01:30:01.212 line:82%
Uncle, looks like you've been there.

1033
01:30:01.671 --> 01:30:04.924 line:82%
You've probably played many
supporting roles too.

1034
01:30:05.341 --> 01:30:09.303 line:82%
Let's raise a toast to that.
Cheers to side heroes!

1035
01:30:09.761 --> 01:30:11.263 line:82%
Cheers, my boy!

1036
01:31:21.452 --> 01:31:22.578 line:82%
Anay and Shyra!

1037
01:31:26.332 --> 01:31:28.834 line:82%
Wow! You've become
Shah Rukh Khan!

1038
01:31:30.335 --> 01:31:31.712 line:82%
Where the hell have you been?

1039
01:31:32.087 --> 01:31:35.757 line:82%
No phone call, no message. I've been
going crazy wedding shopping alone.

1040
01:31:36.174 --> 01:31:38.885 line:82%
Sorry. I was in Courchevel with
Christine's family. Skiing.

1041
01:31:39.135 --> 01:31:40.303 line:82%
No network.

1042
01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.597 line:82%
- Christine has a family?
- A massive one!

1043
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.683 line:82%
Two brothers, two fathers.
All footballers.

1044
01:31:46.016 --> 01:31:47.184 line:82%
By the way...

1045
01:31:47.768 --> 01:31:50.729 line:82%
very soon a new member
is joining her family.

1046
01:31:52.355 --> 01:31:53.355 line:82%
What?

1047
01:31:53.607 --> 01:31:54.607 line:82%
Yeah!

1048
01:31:55.317 --> 01:31:57.110 line:82%
I'm marrying Christine.

1049
01:31:59.278 --> 01:32:00.321 line:82%
You, what?

1050
01:32:00.613 --> 01:32:03.699 line:82%
She doesn't know yet. I'll surprise her
when the moment's right.

1051
01:32:04.158 --> 01:32:05.618 line:82%
Had to tell you first.

1052
01:32:11.039 --> 01:32:13.792 line:82%
One doesn't just get married.
Think about it.

1053
01:32:14.167 --> 01:32:16.544 line:82%
You and Christine have nothing in common.

1054
01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.505 line:82%
You're not thinking from your head,
but from elsewhere!

1055
01:32:20.131 --> 01:32:21.131 line:82%
Wow!

1056
01:32:22.133 --> 01:32:25.469 line:82%
You decide with your head and your heart.
Me? From elsewhere!

1057
01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:30.827 line:82%
You asked for advice about Anay.
I was so supportive! But you?

1058
01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:33.968 line:82%
Okay, don't be under the impression
that I was following your advice.

1059
01:32:34.144 --> 01:32:36.104 line:82%
- It was my decision.
- And this is mine.

1060
01:32:36.479 --> 01:32:39.732 line:82%
Stop it, Dharam. Big difference
between Anay and Christine.

1061
01:32:40.358 --> 01:32:44.653 line:82%
Christine is probably a nice girl,
but she's not right for you.

1062
01:32:45.654 --> 01:32:47.698 line:82%
You need someone
to balance you.

1063
01:32:48.031 --> 01:32:50.993 line:82%
Someone who can can
control your immaturity.

1064
01:32:51.535 --> 01:32:54.120 line:82%
She is half-crazy too,
how will she handle you?

1065
01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:58.708 line:82%
I know you very well. You're
not ready for marriage.

1066
01:32:59.083 --> 01:33:01.711 line:82%
You're definitely not
marrying her. Got it?

1067
01:33:07.341 --> 01:33:08.550 line:82%
I get it.

1068
01:33:10.761 --> 01:33:11.845 line:82%
You get what?

1069
01:33:14.264 --> 01:33:15.348 line:82%
Nothing.

1070
01:33:19.102 --> 01:33:21.521 line:82%
- You laughing at me?
- No. I'm laughing at me.

1071
01:33:23.856 --> 01:33:25.524 line:82%
It's crystal clear.

1072
01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:28.986 line:82%
What's clear?

1073
01:33:33.073 --> 01:33:34.949 line:82%
You're not over me.

1074
01:33:37.076 --> 01:33:38.578 line:82%
You're still not over me.

1075
01:33:41.956 --> 01:33:45.501 line:82%
That's why you can't bear
to see me with someone else.

1076
01:33:47.252 --> 01:33:49.755 line:82%
You can't bear me settling down

1077
01:33:50.022 --> 01:33:53.341 line:82%
because it reminds you of
your own shortcomings.

1078
01:33:55.427 --> 01:33:59.180 line:82%
And what you lack that stops me
from marrying you.

1079
01:34:01.557 --> 01:34:02.767 line:82%
I get it.

1080
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:17.488 line:82%
First you broke my heart
as a boyfriend.

1081
01:34:20.074 --> 01:34:22.410 line:82%
Now you're breaking it
as a friend.

1082
01:34:27.706 --> 01:34:28.791 line:82%
It's good.

1083
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.671 line:82%
Finally it's over between us.
You can't hurt me anymore.

1084
01:34:39.008 --> 01:34:41.260 line:82%
You know what? Do whatever.

1085
01:35:50.449 --> 01:35:51.449 line:82%
What?

1086
01:35:52.742 --> 01:35:53.952 line:82%
I'll be back in a minute.

1087
01:35:55.912 --> 01:35:57.413 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen,

1088
01:35:57.747 --> 01:35:58.752 line:82%
Shyra's best friend Dharam

1089
01:35:58.863 --> 01:36:01.417 line:82%
has just proposed
to his beautiful girlfriend, Christine!

1090
01:36:01.638 --> 01:36:04.545 line:82%
so please join me in raising a toast
to this wonderful surprise!

1091
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:09.841 line:82%
My man, fix the date now.

1092
01:36:10.133 --> 01:36:13.136 line:82%
We're getting married
on the same day as you.

1093
01:36:13.428 --> 01:36:15.055 line:82%
Same time, same place?
Done?

1094
01:36:15.347 --> 01:36:16.347 line:82%
Done!

1095
01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:19.902 line:82%
Okay everyone, you're no longer invited
to the Anay and Shyra wedding.

1096
01:36:21.519 --> 01:36:25.648 line:82%
But you are invited to a double wedding
of Dharam and Christine...

1097
01:36:26.023 --> 01:36:30.777 line:82%
and Anay and Shyra on the 21st of April
at the exclusive region of Picardie.

1098
01:37:34.794 --> 01:37:37.672 line:82%
Why did Christine bring bodyguards?

1099
01:37:38.095 --> 01:37:41.217 line:82%
They're not bodyguards. They're her
footballer brothers and Dads.

1100
01:37:41.551 --> 01:37:43.302 line:82%
Her mother is behind them.

1101
01:37:44.845 --> 01:37:48.182 line:82%
Christine's brother is such
a gentleman, so loving.

1102
01:37:48.807 --> 01:37:53.386 line:82%
- Like an Indian son, not very French.
- That's Christine's stepfather.

1103
01:37:55.105 --> 01:37:56.481 line:82%
Don't drink with them.

1104
01:37:56.731 --> 01:38:00.026 line:82%
They love punching their
drinking pals. It'd be the end of you.

1105
01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:06.365 line:82%
That group is Anay's banker friends.

1106
01:38:07.282 --> 01:38:09.368 line:82%
Highly educated, very rich.

1107
01:38:09.743 --> 01:38:11.370 line:82%
Keep away, out of your league.

1108
01:38:16.916 --> 01:38:18.334 line:82%
They're Shyra's friends.

1109
01:38:19.002 --> 01:38:22.755 line:82%
There's no telling who is straight
and who is gay.

1110
01:38:23.089 --> 01:38:25.216 line:82%
So protect your family jewels.
Stay away.

1111
01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:28.093 line:82%
So must I just say "bonjour, merci"
and run?

1112
01:38:28.427 --> 01:38:29.803 line:82%
No silly jokes, please.

1113
01:38:30.095 --> 01:38:32.639 line:82%
You're my only guest.
I have a reputation to protect.

1114
01:38:33.014 --> 01:38:35.600 line:82%
- Must I wear a burqa?
- Yeah! You'll look slimmer.

1115
01:38:36.976 --> 01:38:37.977 line:82%
Hi, guys!

1116
01:38:43.193 --> 01:38:45.359 line:82%
Why the hell is Shyra getting married?

1117
01:38:46.277 --> 01:38:48.987 line:82%
If I knew, I'd be
an expert on women.

1118
01:38:50.655 --> 01:38:51.907 line:82%
Why are you getting married?

1119
01:38:54.363 --> 01:38:56.870 line:82%
If I knew, I'd be
an expert on life.

1120
01:39:02.083 --> 01:39:05.753 line:82%
Maybe she's getting married for
the same reason you are.

1121
01:39:07.504 --> 01:39:09.173 line:82%
Hello, darling!

1122
01:39:10.549 --> 01:39:13.385 line:82%
- So you're a Kamasutra expert?
- Learn from me.

1123
01:39:16.224 --> 01:39:21.517 line:82%
Jogi, don't you feel like a guest
at a neighbour's wedding?

1124
01:39:22.069 --> 01:39:25.729 line:82%
If we were in India, shehnais
would be playing.

1125
01:39:26.188 --> 01:39:30.734 line:82%
There'd be a dessert counter there,
laden with goodies.

1126
01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.361 line:82%
And there would be drums.

1127
01:39:33.987 --> 01:39:37.407 line:82%
We raised her as a French girl.
Why cry now?

1128
01:39:38.008 --> 01:39:40.451 line:82%
Sip your champagne.
Calm your nerves.

1129
01:39:41.202 --> 01:39:43.871 line:82%
I feel like giving her a hard slap.

1130
01:39:44.205 --> 01:39:47.458 line:82%
And bringing her up all over again,
in full Punjabi style.

1131
01:39:47.895 --> 01:39:48.959 line:82%
You're silly.

1132
01:39:49.495 --> 01:39:53.046 line:82%
We don't bring up kids anymore.
They bring us up.

1133
01:39:53.881 --> 01:39:55.590 line:82%
Bless me!

1134
01:39:55.965 --> 01:40:00.803 line:82%
Mehra has ordered Indian snacks.
The waiter will serve you hot chai.

1135
01:40:01.221 --> 01:40:02.930 line:82%
We'll make do with champagne.

1136
01:40:03.222 --> 01:40:07.428 line:82%
No way, sir. My guests must
enjoy my style.

1137
01:40:07.751 --> 01:40:10.128 line:82%
- Are you ok?
- Tip top! Doesn't it show?

1138
01:40:10.587 --> 01:40:12.880 line:82%
Shows too much. That's what
worries me.

1139
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:16.802 line:82%
I can smell pakoras.
I'll be right back.

1140
01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:21.849 line:82%
This rascal made Shyra's life hell.

1141
01:40:24.643 --> 01:40:29.314 line:82%
Did Shyra behave any better?
Two nuts off the same tree.

1142
01:40:29.898 --> 01:40:32.525 line:82%
Maybe that's why I could
never dislike him.

1143
01:40:38.989 --> 01:40:40.783 line:82%
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

1144
01:40:44.912 --> 01:40:48.999 line:82%
The real problem is Shyra can't
really dislike him either.

1145
01:40:50.125 --> 01:40:52.835 line:82%
- It's piping hot.
- Thank you.

1146
01:40:56.297 --> 01:40:57.673 line:82%
Shall I get you a napkin?

1147
01:40:57.923 --> 01:40:59.341 line:82%
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

1148
01:41:08.475 --> 01:41:10.727 line:82%
Shyra! Remember my crazy friend
Chris from college?

1149
01:41:11.102 --> 01:41:13.062 line:82%
- He wants to meet you.
- Really?

1150
01:41:26.116 --> 01:41:27.826 line:82%
Good evening, everyone!

1151
01:41:28.485 --> 01:41:32.029 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Sangeet night.

1152
01:41:32.455 --> 01:41:36.459 line:82%
In India, no wedding is complete
without this musical night.

1153
01:41:36.792 --> 01:41:40.212 line:82%
Traditionally, it's a battle between
the boy's side and the girl's.

1154
01:41:40.588 --> 01:41:44.007 line:82%
Tonight it's Dharam vs. Shyra.

1155
01:41:46.802 --> 01:41:47.802 line:82%
All right!

1156
01:41:48.261 --> 01:41:52.098 line:82%
We've seen their crazy anytime-
anywhere dancing.

1157
01:41:52.682 --> 01:41:56.394 line:82%
Tonight they'll be dancing
together for one last time.

1158
01:41:56.978 --> 01:42:00.314 line:82%
So put your hands together
for Dharam and Shyra.

1159
01:42:00.856 --> 01:42:01.856 line:82%
No way!

1160
01:42:03.692 --> 01:42:05.068 line:82%
No, I'm not dancing.

1161
01:42:06.028 --> 01:42:07.696 line:82%
No seriously, Come on!

1162
01:42:12.909 --> 01:42:14.035 line:82%
Yes!

1163
01:42:15.263 --> 01:42:18.805 line:82%
Seriously, I don't think it's a good idea
I really am not in the mood, please.

1164
01:42:21.208 --> 01:42:24.127 line:82%
Come on, guys! Make some noise
for Dharam and Shyra.

1165
01:47:16.027 --> 01:47:19.940 line:82%
You still need Mummy's help
for some things in life.

1166
01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:24.528 line:82%
How do you make a paratha
without a rolling pin?

1167
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:28.240 line:82%
That's cool.

1168
01:47:28.725 --> 01:47:32.911 line:82%
How do you think your parents
became chefs in France?

1169
01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:34.662 line:82%
That's true.

1170
01:47:35.956 --> 01:47:40.167 line:82%
Why is my French child craving
a Punjabi paratha today?

1171
01:47:41.710 --> 01:47:46.048 line:82%
You used to make parathas for me
to take to school till 3rd grade.

1172
01:47:46.923 --> 01:47:50.218 line:82%
I remember. I also remember
you making...

1173
01:47:50.817 --> 01:47:53.638 line:82%
peanut butter sandwiches instead.

1174
01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:57.224 line:82%
You stopped eating Indian food
from that day.

1175
01:48:00.102 --> 01:48:04.690 line:82%
When I opened my lunch box, all the
kids would run away from me.

1176
01:48:05.315 --> 01:48:08.902 line:82%
They hated the smell of your
Punjabi ghee-parathas.

1177
01:48:09.806 --> 01:48:12.405 line:82%
No one would play with me.
I was always alone.

1178
01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:17.159 line:82%
But with sandwiches - that's when
I made friends.

1179
01:48:18.619 --> 01:48:20.996 line:82%
From that day I became
completely French.

1180
01:48:21.738 --> 01:48:23.832 line:82%
Disliked everything Indian.

1181
01:48:25.959 --> 01:48:27.878 line:82%
The strange thing was...

1182
01:48:28.837 --> 01:48:30.672 line:82%
whenever I got upset...

1183
01:48:31.256 --> 01:48:34.550 line:82%
did badly at exams or fought with
a friend or...

1184
01:48:35.384 --> 01:48:37.219 line:82%
broke-up with a boyfriend...

1185
01:48:37.843 --> 01:48:40.139 line:82%
I quietly made myself a paratha

1186
01:48:40.494 --> 01:48:42.558 line:82%
and enjoyed eating it all alone.

1187
01:48:43.798 --> 01:48:46.561 line:82%
Don't know why it changed
my mood.

1188
01:48:47.562 --> 01:48:49.773 line:82%
It had the warm feeling of Dad's hug,

1189
01:48:50.759 --> 01:48:52.775 line:82%
The fragrance of your clothes.

1190
01:48:55.190 --> 01:48:58.030 line:82%
It made me feel like no matter what...

1191
01:48:59.782 --> 01:49:01.075 line:82%
I was fine.

1192
01:49:01.964 --> 01:49:03.660 line:82%
- I know.
- How?

1193
01:49:04.077 --> 01:49:07.078 line:82%
Who cleaned up the kitchen after
the mess you made?

1194
01:49:10.576 --> 01:49:13.670 line:82%
What's the reason you want
a paratha today?

1195
01:49:15.713 --> 01:49:19.592 line:82%
No reason. I just felt like having
a paratha.

1196
01:49:20.551 --> 01:49:21.551 line:82%
Don't know why.

1197
01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:26.139 line:82%
Today you're fighting yourself.

1198
01:49:27.412 --> 01:49:30.310 line:82%
You're getting married but you're unsure

1199
01:49:30.566 --> 01:49:33.187 line:82%
if this guy is as comforting as a paratha.

1200
01:49:35.287 --> 01:49:38.651 line:82%
It's not Papa's hug you seek,
or the fragrance of my clothes.

1201
01:49:40.163 --> 01:49:41.718 line:82%
Today you're looking for love...

1202
01:49:43.572 --> 01:49:47.075 line:82%
wrapped in laughter and fun,
in songs and dances.

1203
01:49:47.701 --> 01:49:52.705 line:82%
Someone who makes up after
silly fights. A lifetime best friend.

1204
01:50:00.254 --> 01:50:04.883 line:82%
Find what you're looking for.
If you don't find it, don't marry.

1205
01:50:07.052 --> 01:50:10.899 line:82%
This is not India. Take advantage
of being French.

1206
01:50:56.234 --> 01:50:57.277 line:82%
What is it?

1207
01:51:00.947 --> 01:51:02.240 line:82%
I don't want to get married.

1208
01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:11.290 line:82%
What an idiot!

1209
01:51:15.043 --> 01:51:17.546 line:82%
You're the biggest ass
in the world. Know that, right?

1210
01:51:17.921 --> 01:51:18.921 line:82%
I know.

1211
01:51:19.256 --> 01:51:22.615 line:82%
You've always said that. I totally agree
that I'm the biggest ass in the world.

1212
01:51:29.682 --> 01:51:31.642 line:82%
How did you get into
this marriage mess?

1213
01:51:32.101 --> 01:51:33.143 line:82%
It's your fault.

1214
01:51:33.394 --> 01:51:35.103 line:82%
- My fault?
- What else?

1215
01:51:35.562 --> 01:51:37.856 line:82%
You suddenly decided to get married.

1216
01:51:38.231 --> 01:51:40.900 line:82%
I didn't want to be left alone.
Damn it!

1217
01:51:41.317 --> 01:51:42.735 line:82%
I'll get married too.

1218
01:51:43.319 --> 01:51:47.281 line:82%
- You were marrying because I was?
- What else?

1219
01:51:47.865 --> 01:51:52.092 line:82%
I was angry, upset, alone.

1220
01:51:52.411 --> 01:51:54.079 line:82%
Why were you upset?

1221
01:51:55.247 --> 01:51:56.331 line:82%
I don't know.

1222
01:51:57.416 --> 01:52:00.460 line:82%
You know I don't know
why I do what I do.

1223
01:52:01.002 --> 01:52:03.546 line:82%
Also, I had to be
your best friend.

1224
01:52:04.297 --> 01:52:08.551 line:82%
You were happy. I was trying
to be mature and a good friend.

1225
01:52:09.135 --> 01:52:13.263 line:82%
And what if you didn't need to behave
or to be mature?

1226
01:52:14.556 --> 01:52:16.224 line:82%
What would you have done?

1227
01:52:18.435 --> 01:52:19.561 line:82%
I don't know.

1228
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:23.022 line:82%
Anyway, what's the point now?

1229
01:52:27.485 --> 01:52:28.611 line:82%
You're right.

1230
01:52:30.404 --> 01:52:32.948 line:82%
- No point now.
- Tell me what can I do

1231
01:52:33.407 --> 01:52:34.908 line:82%
to get out of this mess?

1232
01:52:36.076 --> 01:52:37.452 line:82%
Can I fake my death?

1233
01:52:38.245 --> 01:52:40.622 line:82%
Mehra could say I drowned.
Body missing.

1234
01:52:41.539 --> 01:52:43.082 line:82%
Should I leave a note and run?

1235
01:52:44.005 --> 01:52:46.559 line:82%
Or say I have a bad heart:
"I've only got six months to live."

1236
01:52:46.711 --> 01:52:48.004 line:82%
Tell her straight.

1237
01:52:48.587 --> 01:52:50.005 line:82%
What do you mean?

1238
01:52:51.382 --> 01:52:54.426 line:82%
Look Christine in the eye,
and tell her the truth.

1239
01:52:55.677 --> 01:52:57.637 line:82%
Truth and nothing but the truth.

1240
01:52:58.346 --> 01:53:00.098 line:82%
That's the only way.

1241
01:53:02.183 --> 01:53:04.811 line:82%
If you say I love you
or break a heart...

1242
01:53:05.603 --> 01:53:07.438 line:82%
there are no shortcuts.

1243
01:53:10.191 --> 01:53:11.483 line:82%
Go and tell her.

1244
01:53:11.942 --> 01:53:14.987 line:82%
At first she may cry.
But she'll be ok soon.

1245
01:53:16.029 --> 01:53:17.531 line:82%
The most important thing is...

1246
01:53:17.906 --> 01:53:21.117 line:82%
you would've finally gone from a Delhi lad
to a gentleman.

1247
01:53:31.126 --> 01:53:32.169 line:82%
I'm off.

1248
01:53:32.711 --> 01:53:35.589 line:82%
Don't know about you, but I'm
marrying in the morning.

1249
01:53:39.634 --> 01:53:40.634 line:82%
Shyra.

1250
01:53:55.190 --> 01:53:57.609 line:82%
I would've been such an idiot
without you.

1251
01:53:58.318 --> 01:53:59.318 line:82%
True!

1252
01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:04.115 line:82%
Another truth?

1253
01:54:06.742 --> 01:54:09.787 line:82%
When I see you with another man,
I'm sick to my stomach.

1254
01:54:18.044 --> 01:54:22.173 line:82%
I hope your marriage breaks up
tomorrow.

1255
01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:26.219 line:82%
If you have the guts, you break it.

1256
01:54:28.512 --> 01:54:29.764 line:82%
I dare you!

1257
01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:39.438 line:82%
No.

1258
01:54:42.901 --> 01:54:45.486 line:82%
I can only destroy
one marriage in a day.

1259
01:55:11.135 --> 01:55:14.513 line:82%
Don't ever look back

1260
01:55:15.389 --> 01:55:18.183 line:82%
At the street you left behind.

1261
01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:22.103 line:82%
If you see him somewhere

1262
01:55:23.271 --> 01:55:25.440 line:82%
Turn and walk away

1263
01:55:26.983 --> 01:55:30.694 line:82%
Never say I love you,
never say je t'aime

1264
01:55:34.823 --> 01:55:38.118 line:82%
Never say you're in love

1265
01:55:38.952 --> 01:55:41.454 line:82%
Never say je t'aime

1266
01:55:42.705 --> 01:55:45.958 line:82%
Thorns are strewn on this path

1267
01:55:46.584 --> 01:55:49.086 line:82%
Careful where you tread

1268
01:55:50.546 --> 01:55:53.966 line:82%
Impossible desires will
swallow up your heart

1269
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:56.760 line:82%
Go easy on yourself

1270
01:56:36.338 --> 01:56:37.338 line:82%
Come, come.

1271
01:56:41.259 --> 01:56:42.469 line:82%
One minute.

1272
01:56:43.928 --> 01:56:44.928 line:82%
Just wait.

1273
01:56:48.474 --> 01:56:49.809 line:82%
Anay, my friend!

1274
01:56:50.518 --> 01:56:53.395 line:82%
Let me tell you,
you're my worst enemy.

1275
01:56:54.104 --> 01:56:55.898 line:82%
You're taking Shyra away from me.

1276
01:56:56.523 --> 01:56:58.775 line:82%
I wanted to wish you bad luck.

1277
01:56:59.359 --> 01:57:01.736 line:82%
Now you're marrying Shyra,
I don't need to.

1278
01:57:06.365 --> 01:57:07.575 line:82%
I'm not joking.

1279
01:57:08.826 --> 01:57:12.037 line:82%
This girl has destroyed so many guys.

1280
01:57:12.997 --> 01:57:14.331 line:82%
Me, too.

1281
01:57:15.249 --> 01:57:17.000 line:82%
She'll turn you into a lap dog.

1282
01:57:17.626 --> 01:57:20.503 line:82%
Has she told you how many guys
she's messed around with?

1283
01:57:20.772 --> 01:57:21.822 line:82%
Oh sorry.

1284
01:57:22.005 --> 01:57:24.632 line:82%
She hasn't messed around with you.
Your love story is platonic.

1285
01:57:25.008 --> 01:57:27.218 line:82%
She's done everything with me.

1286
01:57:27.552 --> 01:57:31.680 line:82%
Now she's being a saint.
She's a cheat. Careful!

1287
01:57:31.972 --> 01:57:34.308 line:82%
She'll make your life hell.

1288
01:57:35.392 --> 01:57:40.188 line:82%
She deserves a supporting act
like me. I'm already doomed.

1289
01:57:40.522 --> 01:57:44.233 line:82%
Careful. Don't blow your life
by marrying her. Run!

1290
01:57:46.777 --> 01:57:47.777 line:82%
Shyra...

1291
01:57:49.113 --> 01:57:50.781 line:82%
will you handle your friend?

1292
01:57:51.907 --> 01:57:52.950 line:82%
Or must I?

1293
01:58:04.794 --> 01:58:07.046 line:82%
Behaving like a Delhi idiot again!

1294
01:58:09.006 --> 01:58:10.341 line:82%
What did I tell you?

1295
01:58:10.841 --> 01:58:13.177 line:82%
Look straight into her eyes
and tell her...

1296
01:58:13.886 --> 01:58:16.930 line:82%
the truth, nothing but the truth.

1297
01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:23.937 line:82%
I love you. There's no
greater truth in my life.

1298
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:27.607 line:82%
I can't live without you. I tried.

1299
01:58:28.399 --> 01:58:30.276 line:82%
I could manage without
the old Shyra.

1300
01:58:30.568 --> 01:58:33.612 line:82%
But I can't live without
this best friend Shyra.

1301
01:58:35.072 --> 01:58:36.490 line:82%
I'm going to kiss you now.

1302
01:58:37.115 --> 01:58:39.534 line:82%
Slap me. Stop me forever.

1303
01:58:40.201 --> 01:58:41.786 line:82%
Or never ever stop me.

1304
01:59:24.993 --> 01:59:25.993 line:82%
You're dead.

1305
01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:36.169 line:82%
Let go of me!

1306
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:52.935 line:82%
Wait! What is this?

1307
02:00:43.356 --> 02:00:44.899 line:82%
Hail Mother Goddess!

1308
02:01:29.357 --> 02:01:31.859 line:82%
See how I saved you from
that silent terminator?

1309
02:01:32.276 --> 02:01:34.486 line:82%
You were marrying a serial killer.

1310
02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:38.365 line:82%
Never trusted him. No one can
be that sugary.

1311
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:40.992 line:82%
Go back to Delhi. They won't
spare you here.

1312
02:01:41.326 --> 02:01:43.912 line:82%
I'm French now. Paris is my home.

1313
02:01:44.287 --> 02:01:46.414 line:82%
You still haven't learned
a word of French.

1314
02:01:46.706 --> 02:01:49.000 line:82%
You're with me. My French dictionary.

1315
02:01:49.333 --> 02:01:51.252 line:82%
I tried living with you once.
Not interested.

1316
02:01:52.503 --> 02:01:53.754 line:82%
Marry me.

1317
02:01:56.131 --> 02:01:59.367 line:82%
The biggest dare of your life.
Do you have the guts?

1318
02:02:00.885 --> 02:02:02.554 line:82%
Know what marriage means?

1319
02:02:03.096 --> 02:02:05.056 line:82%
Your life is in another's hands forever.

1320
02:02:05.681 --> 02:02:07.808 line:82%
Very few get it right.
That's why it's a dare.

1321
02:02:08.142 --> 02:02:10.728 line:82%
It's one dare that
no one does alone.

1322
02:02:11.562 --> 02:02:12.938 line:82%
It's a dare for two.

1323
02:02:14.731 --> 02:02:15.731 line:82%
I know.

1324
02:02:31.664 --> 02:02:35.000 line:82%
Ok, Dharam Gulati.
I put my life in your hands.

1325
02:02:36.627 --> 02:02:39.963 line:82%
If you have the guts,
then put your life in mine.

1326
02:03:14.912 --> 02:03:17.622 line:82%
If I die, I won't spare you.

1327
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:33.470 line:82%
After three years of
French kissing Shyra...

1328
02:03:33.804 --> 02:03:35.764 line:82%
I finally understood what love is.

1329
02:03:37.432 --> 02:03:39.392 line:82%
Love is a bungee jump.

1330
02:03:40.810 --> 02:03:42.562 line:82%
Jump if you dare.

1331
02:03:44.355 --> 02:03:47.149 line:82%
No guarantee of a safe landing.

1332
02:03:48.901 --> 02:03:52.363 line:82%
The one who thinks will be
left behind. The one who jumps...

1333
02:03:53.781 --> 02:03:54.781 line:82%
will fly!

1334
02:03:56.658 --> 02:03:59.244 line:82%
So till you're in the air,
be carefree...

1335
02:03:59.786 --> 02:04:01.246 line:82%
and enjoy the flight.

1336
02:04:01.704 --> 02:04:04.082 line:82%
Maybe you won't need to land
after all.

1337
02:07:41.031 --> 02:07:42.866 line:82%
I told you the knife
would be useless.

1338
02:07:43.157 --> 02:07:46.119 line:82%
I'm no carpenter. Why would I be
carrying a hammer?

1339
02:07:47.409 --> 02:07:48.409 line:82%
I'm going.

1340
02:07:48.537 --> 02:07:50.956 line:82%
Whose idea was
this love lock anyway?

1341
02:07:52.124 --> 02:07:53.513 line:82%
- It's still your fault.
- Mine?

1342
02:07:53.667 --> 02:07:55.877 line:82%
Obviously, all my ideas are stupid.

1343
02:07:56.211 --> 02:07:58.505 line:82%
Why did this breakup love lock
excite you?

1344
02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:00.173 line:82%
You knew you weren't over me.

1345
02:08:00.465 --> 02:08:03.885 line:82%
But you insisted we'd promise
not to love each other.

1346
02:08:04.093 --> 02:08:05.219 line:82%
You're so stupid.

1347
02:08:05.373 --> 02:08:07.331 line:82%
I can't believe you're putting
the blame on me!

1348
02:08:07.422 --> 02:08:08.729 line:82%
Of course I'll put the blame on you!

1349
02:08:08.834 --> 02:08:11.016 line:82%
Some days you say,
"Never say 'I love you.'"

1350
02:08:11.308 --> 02:08:14.186 line:82%
Then you say, "Look into my eyes
and say you love me."

1351
02:08:14.478 --> 02:08:16.897 line:82%
You're nuts. You break the lock.

1352
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:21.109 line:82%
You know what. Forget it.
I'm done with you. Goodbye.

1353
02:08:21.484 --> 02:08:22.902 line:82%
- Where to?
- Anay's.

1354
02:08:23.278 --> 02:08:27.156 line:82%
- I'll beg him to marry me.
- The psycho is in the madhouse.

1355
02:08:27.531 --> 02:08:29.116 line:82%
I'm not coming after you.

1356
02:08:29.492 --> 02:08:30.492 line:82%
Ok.

1357
02:08:30.784 --> 02:08:32.119 line:82%
Fine.
