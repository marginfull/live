Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:58.417 line:82%
Bomb suit for major Anand, sir...

3
00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:00.334 line:82%
He won't wear it.

4
00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:01.834 line:82%
But sir... I mean...

5
00:02:02.626 --> 00:02:03.792 line:82%
Keep watching.

6
00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.459 line:82%
What is it, Dewan?

7
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.792 line:82%
I can't figure it out, sir...

8
00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:11.584 line:82%
...it looks like a radio
control servo with a switch...

9
00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:14.250 line:82%
...but I can't locate the receiver...

10
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.542 line:82%
...and the x-ray hasn't
shown up anything either.

11
00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:19.459 line:82%
You rest, I'll take a look.

12
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:20.626 line:82%
OK, sir.

13
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.751 line:82%
Sir, is this the same
Major Samar Anand.

14
00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.334 line:82%
Who has the record for the
maximum number of bombs defused?

15
00:02:56.417 --> 00:02:59.125 line:82%
Yup, 97 bombs...

16
00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.751 line:82%
...this is the 98th...

17
00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:03.751 line:82%
...and he goes into the lap
of each bomb just like this...

18
00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:05.125 line:82%
...without any protection...

19
00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.334 line:82%
...as if it's not a bomb...

20
00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.501 line:82%
...but the arms of his girlfriend.

21
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.667 line:82%
Sir, is that why they call
him 'the man who cannot die'?

22
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.751 line:82%
Yes, 'The Man Who Cannot Die.'

23
00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:21.209 line:82%
All of us have to die one day...

24
00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.083 line:82%
...and so will he...

25
00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:27.042 line:82%
...until today I've never seen
the fear of death in his eyes.

26
00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:30.626 line:82%
I can't understand the kind of
fate he's had written for him.

27
00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.375 line:82%
They had hidden the receiver within
the RDX and covered it with lead...

28
00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:11.042 line:82%
...that's why the X-ray
couldn't catch it.

29
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.250 line:82%
Singh, open up the market.

30
00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:17.459 line:82%
Okay sir.

31
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:20.250 line:82%
- Amaanullah, sir, open the market.
- Okay.

32
00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:43.250 line:82%
Your eyes, impish and mischievous.

33
00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:47.042 line:82%
Your laughter's nonchalant insolence.

34
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.584 line:82%
Your hair unfurled their waves undone.

35
00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.751 line:82%
Never shall I forget.

36
00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:56.209 line:82%
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.

37
00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:08.584 line:82%
Your hand that abandoned mine.

38
00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:11.000 line:82%
Your shadow that turned away it's gaze.

39
00:05:11.334 --> 00:05:13.626 line:82%
Your look that never looked back.

40
00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:15.834 line:82%
Never shall I forgive.

41
00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:19.292 line:82%
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.

42
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.876 line:82%
Your unabashed dancing in the rain.

43
00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.501 line:82%
Your silly sulkings
at all things small.

44
00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:40.792 line:82%
Your innocent childlike mischief.

45
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.209 line:82%
Always I will love.

46
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:46.501 line:82%
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.

47
00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:10.542 line:82%
Your false vows and promises.

48
00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:13.334 line:82%
Your burning scorching dreams.

49
00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:16.125 line:82%
Your cruel ruthless prayers.

50
00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.042 line:82%
Always I will hate.

51
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:21.292 line:82%
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.

52
00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.876 line:82%
In the name of God...

53
00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:17.876 line:82%
Oh shit!

54
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:20.334 line:82%
The water is freezing...

55
00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:24.959 line:82%
Freezing!

56
00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:31.709 line:82%
Help!

57
00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:34.459 line:82%
Help!

58
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.501 line:82%
Soldier!

59
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:41.667 line:82%
Water... col...
cold... freezing... please...

60
00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:43.959 line:82%
...help please...

61
00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:47.501 line:82%
...please.

62
00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.000 line:82%
What if I had died?

63
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.209 line:82%
Couldn't you have come earlier?

64
00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:29.584 line:82%
You're a soldier...

65
00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:33.125 line:82%
...you'll... have taken
some oath haven't you...

66
00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:35.250 line:82%
...to save lives of fellow Indians?

67
00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:40.417 line:82%
I was in such a dangerous situation...

68
00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:42.375 line:82%
I could have died...

69
00:08:52.334 --> 00:08:54.125 line:82%
Arcehole!

70
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.042 line:82%
Nice!

71
00:09:07.292 --> 00:09:09.250 line:82%
Oh God!

72
00:09:09.334 --> 00:09:10.918 line:82%
Akira!

73
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.834 line:82%
I can't believe you actually did it!

74
00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:13.834 line:82%
Just pay up guys!

75
00:09:13.918 --> 00:09:16.167 line:82%
I'm going bankrupt because of you...

76
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.667 line:82%
...this is the fifth dare in 3 weeks...

77
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.292 line:82%
...for once can you not
complete a dare?

78
00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:22.626 line:82%
Stop being such a wuss, Sam...

79
00:09:22.709 --> 00:09:25.292 line:82%
...two more days and you all will
be in the London discovery office...

80
00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:26.876 line:82%
...and I will be stuck in Delhi...

81
00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.834 line:82%
...and then you will miss
me and you'll be like.

82
00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:30.876 line:82%
I wish I had given Akira
all my money...

83
00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.626 line:82%
...after all she got
paid shit as an intern.

84
00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:33.751 line:82%
I won't miss you.

85
00:09:33.834 --> 00:09:36.626 line:82%
Alright, you lot listen up,
stop whatever it is you are doing...

86
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:38.834 line:82%
...it's my day off...

87
00:09:38.918 --> 00:09:41.584 line:82%
...so I don't want to see any
of your ugly faces today...

88
00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:43.542 line:82%
...but tomorrow morning I
want your boney arces...

89
00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:45.501 line:82%
...back here at 7 o'clock sharp.

90
00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.250 line:82%
Aye, aye, captain.

91
00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:48.292 line:82%
Catherine!

92
00:09:48.459 --> 00:09:49.501 line:82%
Piss off, Akira.

93
00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:51.417 line:82%
Did you think about
taking me with you to London?

94
00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:54.751 line:82%
Yes I did and the answer
is no, so get out of my face.

95
00:09:56.209 --> 00:09:57.542 line:82%
Bitch!

96
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:09.751 line:82%
Oh, God, man...

97
00:10:11.626 --> 00:10:15.876 line:82%
Arjun, I told you it's
over between us man...

98
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.334 line:82%
...stop calling me.

99
00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:21.042 line:82%
Arjun...

100
00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:24.501 line:82%
...it's only a 6-month relationship,
why are you getting so hyper?

101
00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:29.417 line:82%
You still love me but
now I don't, simple...

102
00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:32.250 line:82%
...come on, get over it,
we'll talk later!

103
00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:52.501 line:82%
Samar Anand...

104
00:10:55.709 --> 00:10:58.459 line:82%
In a way, I had already
lived twenty-five years...

105
00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:02.959 line:82%
...but my life,
actually began on this day.

106
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:15.709 line:82%
The first day of my story...

107
00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:19.042 line:82%
...the first time I saw snow fall...

108
00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:23.375 line:82%
...the first time I saw an
angel glide across the snow.

109
00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.375 line:82%
Did You to have to make
the snow fall right now...

110
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.167 line:82%
...couldn't You have
waited 10 minutes more?

111
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.083 line:82%
Such an expensive dress,
it got wet...

112
00:11:55.501 --> 00:11:57.792 line:82%
...anyway, my results are out.

113
00:11:57.876 --> 00:11:59.417 line:82%
I topped the university.

114
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.918 line:82%
Dad is very happy.

115
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.959 line:82%
Thank You...

116
00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:04.417 line:82%
...and yes, like I promised You,
no more chocolates from today...

117
00:12:04.501 --> 00:12:06.125 line:82%
...never, I promise...

118
00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:09.375 line:82%
...okay, now listen carefully,
today our work is very important.

119
00:12:10.918 --> 00:12:13.250 line:82%
There's a music
ceremony at Bina aunty's...

120
00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:18.000 line:82%
...and Mrs Sanger wants to hook me
up with her wall street banker son.

121
00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:22.501 line:82%
Please, please, please make
sure that he doesn't fancy me.

122
00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.626 line:82%
I will also fully try
to make sure but...

123
00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:29.834 line:82%
...you know how Indian boys behave
stupid when they're around me...

124
00:12:29.918 --> 00:12:32.876 line:82%
...and in any case, I am not
going to marry an Indian boy...

125
00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:34.709 line:82%
...remember me telling You this?

126
00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:37.209 line:82%
Please don't get me
married to any Indian boy...

127
00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:38.626 line:82%
...they are all very brown.

128
00:12:38.751 --> 00:12:41.042 line:82%
Please find me a nice
handsome white boy...

129
00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:43.501 line:82%
...please, please, please.

130
00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:46.876 line:82%
But You have to make sure that
Dad doesn't like that banker...

131
00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:49.834 line:82%
...because You know... I
can never fight with Dad...

132
00:12:49.918 --> 00:12:53.125 line:82%
...so please, please, please don't
let this happen and I promise that...

133
00:12:53.667 --> 00:12:56.501 line:82%
I promise, I will stop
wearing fur coats from today...

134
00:12:56.584 --> 00:12:58.876 line:82%
...and You know how much I love fur.

135
00:12:58.959 --> 00:12:59.876 line:82%
Okay?

136
00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:01.375 line:82%
Deal?

137
00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:03.959 line:82%
Please take care of this.

138
00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:07.959 line:82%
Thanks.

139
00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:23.792 line:82%
Wow, sir Jesus, what specimens
You have to bear...

140
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.709 line:82%
...very hard work, sir.

141
00:13:27.667 --> 00:13:29.375 line:82%
God bless You, sir.

142
00:13:43.918 --> 00:13:46.501 line:82%
Hey Samar, what you doing man?

143
00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:48.209 line:82%
You were supposed to be
finished by lunch time.

144
00:13:48.334 --> 00:13:49.167 line:82%
No worry, Jack Sir.

145
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.042 line:82%
I finish twenty minutes
fully clean, shaving and shining.

146
00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.501 line:82%
I'm picking you up in half
an hour, make sure it's done.

147
00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:57.584 line:82%
Done, done, okay,
ta-ta, see you, bye bye...

148
00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:03.626 line:82%
...from the ground in this country
grows snow, grows white white snow.

149
00:14:13.501 --> 00:14:16.083 line:82%
Come on Zain, it's morning, get up.

150
00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:19.167 line:82%
London's opened her
arms and is calling you.

151
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.083 line:82%
Come on, get up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.

152
00:14:21.167 --> 00:14:22.334 line:82%
Oh man.

153
00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:25.751 line:82%
London is upset with me,
my friend...

154
00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.709 line:82%
...it does not give me
even a half day of work.

155
00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:31.834 line:82%
It's rubbish she has
her arms open for me.

156
00:14:31.918 --> 00:14:35.417 line:82%
Oh London, do something for me...

157
00:14:38.083 --> 00:14:41.167 line:82%
...it seems I might
have to return to Lahore.

158
00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:46.250 line:82%
Oh man, Kapoor uncle,
was asking for the rent...

159
00:14:46.542 --> 00:14:48.167 line:82%
...he was saying we have
to vacate the flat today.

Where is my home?

170
00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:51.834 line:82%
He asks every passer-by.

171
00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:54.042 line:82%
Wanders with a smile...

172
00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:56.083 line:82%
...and a tear.

173
00:15:56.167 --> 00:15:59.417 line:82%
Wanders aimless from street to street.

174
00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.250 line:82%
Belonging to all.

175
00:16:02.334 --> 00:16:04.250 line:82%
Yet none to call my own.

176
00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:07.959 line:82%

00:16:56.292 --> 00:17:00.459 line:82%
Dipped in rainbow colors...

00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:04.501 line:82%
...with voice of a nightingale.

184
00:17:04.584 --> 00:17:08.542 line:82%
With steps radiating sunlight...

185
00:17:08.626 --> 00:17:12.542 line:82%
...with palanquin of cooling shade

186
00:17:12.626 --> 00:17:16.709 line:82%
Dipped in rainbow colors...

190
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:33.667 line:82%
Seeking the moon amidst dark clouds.

191
00:17:33.751 --> 00:17:37.584 line:82%
Listening for the mute wind's song.

192
00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:41.876 line:82%
This friend of mine is everywhere.

193
00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:46.083 line:82%
Unseen to the eye,
fragrant to the smell.

With the beloved, no union,
nor separation.

200
00:18:50.501 --> 00:18:58.542 line:82%
Prisoner of love, never unchained.

201
00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:03.292 line:82%
Your promise of appearing in a dream.

202
00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:07.375 line:82%
Keeps sleep far from my eyes.

203
00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:11.501 line:82%
The breath I take quickens.

204
00:19:11.542 --> 00:19:15.209 line:82%

226
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.584 line:82%
Thank you, Samar, you
always come through for me.

227
00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:42.792 line:82%
Look, if you ever get tired of this.

228
00:20:42.876 --> 00:20:45.918 line:82%
I have a job waiting for
you in one of my restaurants.

229
00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:48.250 line:82%
Thank you, sir.

230
00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:53.167 line:82%
Fodegrass.

231
00:21:27.751 --> 00:21:29.584 line:82%
Ladies and gentleman...

232
00:21:29.626 --> 00:21:35.792 line:82%
...the newly engaged couple Roger
and my beautiful daughter Meera.

233
00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:14.501 line:82%
Hey, aren't you that guy
who sings that Challa song?

234
00:22:16.292 --> 00:22:17.834 line:82%
Yes, same to same, ma'am.

235
00:22:18.542 --> 00:22:20.000 line:82%
What are you doing here?

236
00:22:20.417 --> 00:22:23.292 line:82%
Madam, in your London it is
very difficult to earn pounds...

237
00:22:23.876 --> 00:22:27.292 line:82%
...it is not possible to buy food
with one job, so double shift

238
00:22:31.501 --> 00:22:34.792 line:82%
So, sir Jesus did not listen to you?

239
00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:37.667 line:82%
What?

240
00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:40.542 line:82%
That day in the church,
you told sir Jesus...

241
00:22:40.584 --> 00:22:42.209 line:82%
...to make that boy not like you...

242
00:22:42.292 --> 00:22:44.834 line:82%
...but today it is your arrangement.

243
00:22:45.709 --> 00:22:46.709 line:82%
Engagement.

244
00:22:46.792 --> 00:22:48.250 line:82%
Yes, yes, same.

245
00:22:48.626 --> 00:22:50.417 line:82%
How do you know all this?

246
00:22:50.876 --> 00:22:54.834 line:82%
That day outside the church,
I'm cleaning snow.

247
00:22:55.918 --> 00:22:59.000 line:82%
Listening to others' confessions
is not a good thing...

248
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.083 line:82%
...and for your information on that day
it did not work out with that boy...

249
00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:12.125 line:82%
...so sir Jesus did
listen to me like always.

250
00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:16.167 line:82%
I have known Roger for many years...

251
00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:19.292 line:82%
...he's a really nice guy...

252
00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:21.751 line:82%
...and I am very happy.

253
00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:25.209 line:82%
It does not look like it.

254
00:23:25.292 --> 00:23:26.542 line:82%
What the f?

255
00:23:27.292 --> 00:23:29.626 line:82%
It's the biggest day
of my life today...

256
00:23:29.709 --> 00:23:31.876 line:82%
...and I am very, very happy...

257
00:23:32.626 --> 00:23:33.959 line:82%
...got it?

258
00:23:36.167 --> 00:23:37.501 line:82%
Not got...

259
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:42.000 line:82%
...because when that nice guy,
was making you wear the ring...

260
00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:44.375 line:82%
...you were not looking
into his eyes...

261
00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:45.918 line:82%
...you were looking at everyone else...

262
00:23:46.375 --> 00:23:50.834 line:82%
...and now, you've left your
own engagement celebration...

263
00:23:50.918 --> 00:23:52.584 line:82%
...and are sitting here alone, why?...

264
00:23:52.751 --> 00:23:57.250 line:82%
...and why are you trying to
explain your decision to a stranger.

265
00:24:01.501 --> 00:24:02.501 line:82%
Go... got it.

266
00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:06.000 line:82%
Common Meera uncle's
going nuts looking for you.

267
00:24:06.083 --> 00:24:07.709 line:82%
Will... I found her.

268
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:20.918 line:82%
What the f...

269
00:24:22.792 --> 00:24:26.626 line:82%
The new logo will reflect the
ideals and images of both chains...

270
00:24:26.709 --> 00:24:31.125 line:82%
...a total of 25 new supermarkets
will be opened in six new towns...

271
00:24:31.209 --> 00:24:34.209 line:82%
...and the whole merger and
expansion will take six months.

272
00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:35.542 line:82%
Thank you.

273
00:24:39.584 --> 00:24:42.834 line:82%
Well done. Roger, you've
thought about everything.

274
00:24:43.083 --> 00:24:45.334 line:82%
I think it's time for me to
think about my retirement.

275
00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:49.083 line:82%
I am turning 50,
best time to retire.

276
00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:51.083 line:82%
When is your Golden Jubilee?

277
00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:53.042 line:82%
Meera, we should plan a big party.

278
00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:55.918 line:82%
Don't worry, I've been planning
this party for more than a year now...

279
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.709 line:82%
...it's going to be the most special
party for the most special father.

280
00:24:59.792 --> 00:25:02.250 line:82%
Yes, and after that my daughter
will get married and then...

281
00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:06.584 line:82%
...from a very special father I'll
turn into a very lonely father.

282
00:25:07.083 --> 00:25:10.417 line:82%
But that will only happen
if I leave you alone...

283
00:25:10.959 --> 00:25:12.959 line:82%
...after our marriage
Roger will stay with us.

284
00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:15.250 line:82%
When did this happen?

285
00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:18.459 line:82%
Just now, just a small little
clause I've added in the contract...

286
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:19.834 line:82%
...and it's nonnegotiable.

287
00:25:20.709 --> 00:25:25.542 line:82%
Sorry Roger, she's gone on me,
a very stubborn business woman...

288
00:25:25.626 --> 00:25:27.000 line:82%
...you will have to deal with it.

289
00:25:27.083 --> 00:25:28.834 line:82%
I am trying, I am trying.

290
00:25:37.334 --> 00:25:39.000 line:82%
Here, 500 pounds...

291
00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:42.709 line:82%
...for an hour of your time
every day, for one month.

292
00:25:42.792 --> 00:25:44.292 line:82%
Who do I have to kill?

293
00:25:45.876 --> 00:25:47.792 line:82%
You'll have to teach me how to sing.

294
00:25:50.542 --> 00:25:53.083 line:82%
Why do you want to
learn how to sing from me?

295
00:25:54.709 --> 00:25:56.334 line:82%
My Dad's from Jalandhar...

296
00:25:56.834 --> 00:25:59.334 line:82%
...and he's always wished
that I could speak Punjabi...

297
00:25:59.459 --> 00:26:01.834 line:82%
...but I was never able to learn it.

298
00:26:02.501 --> 00:26:04.125 line:82%
It's his 50th birthday next month.

299
00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:07.501 line:82%
...and I want to surprise him
by singing a Punjabi song...

300
00:26:07.834 --> 00:26:11.459 line:82%
...like the kind that you sing...

301
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.834 line:82%
...so will you teach me?

302
00:26:16.334 --> 00:26:18.667 line:82%
That way 500 pounds
will turn my life around...

303
00:26:19.209 --> 00:26:21.542 line:82%
...but if I take these then I
may also completely turn around.

304
00:26:21.626 --> 00:26:23.083 line:82%
I'll explain.

305
00:26:23.209 --> 00:26:24.834 line:82%
My mother has taught me...

306
00:26:24.918 --> 00:26:27.042 line:82%
...never take money for
teaching someone...

307
00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:30.667 line:82%
...so now you understanding my,
uh, problem?

308
00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:33.667 line:82%
So in that case teach
me without taking money.

309
00:26:33.876 --> 00:26:34.751 line:82%
Madam, I only look like...

310
00:26:34.834 --> 00:26:37.375 line:82%
...but I am not that
big a fool, not dumbo.

311
00:26:39.167 --> 00:26:40.459 line:82%
Fine.

312
00:26:41.792 --> 00:26:45.834 line:82%
Okay, one minute, one second,
can we do a deal?

313
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:48.459 line:82%
I teach you beautiful Punjabi song...

314
00:26:48.501 --> 00:26:52.918 line:82%
...and return gift you teach
me good gentleman's English...

315
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.042 line:82%
...this is now fair and
handsome deal ma'am...

316
00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:57.792 line:82%

the Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar...

317
00:26:57.876 --> 00:26:58.876 line:82%

00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:03.125 line:82%
...and I speak fit-fat constipation
with the white in full tip-top English.

319
00:27:03.834 --> 00:27:05.083 line:82%
Conversation.

320
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:07.584 line:82%
Same to same.

321
00:27:09.542 --> 00:27:11.292 line:82%
Done, done, London let's do it.

322
00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:16.542 line:82%
Done, done,
- London.

323
00:27:19.751 --> 00:27:21.876 line:82%
Uh sorry.

324
00:27:27.876 --> 00:27:29.959 line:82%
Please make sure my Punjabi rocks.

325
00:27:30.042 --> 00:27:33.167 line:82%
I wish that day to
be Dad's happiest day.

326
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.584 line:82%
Please help me and I promise...

327
00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:41.501 line:82%
I promise... I will
never smoke again... ever.

328
00:28:37.459 --> 00:28:40.667 line:82%
O good... good morning.

329
00:28:42.209 --> 00:28:47.042 line:82%
Salmon, salmon... salmon!

330
00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:49.834 line:82%
salmon... salmon!

331
00:28:49.918 --> 00:28:52.334 line:82%
salmon... salmon!

332
00:28:52.417 --> 00:28:53.959 line:82%
SALMON!

333
00:28:56.459 --> 00:28:57.918 line:82%
SALMON!

334
00:29:06.501 --> 00:29:10.709 line:82%
Steak for the lady and
Salmon for the gentleman...

335
00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:13.334 line:82%
...enjoy.

336
00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:28.626 line:82%
Meera.

337
00:29:29.417 --> 00:29:31.250 line:82%
Meera listen, I was joking...

338
00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:33.083 line:82%
Excuse me sir you haven't paid.

339
00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:36.584 line:82%
Meera I don't have money.

340
00:29:43.876 --> 00:29:47.167 line:82%
Sirsa is the name of
my village, in Punjab.

341
00:29:47.417 --> 00:29:48.751 line:82%
My father and forefathers
all served in the army...

342
00:29:48.834 --> 00:29:51.417 line:82%
...but in some war or other
they gave their lives fighting.

343
00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:55.292 line:82%
When it was my time my mother
refused to let me join...

344
00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:58.375 line:82%
...she somehow saved up
money and sent me here.

345
00:29:58.959 --> 00:30:02.209 line:82%
She had this unsaid faith in me
and felt that I'd do well here...

346
00:30:02.751 --> 00:30:05.083 line:82%
...she says that I can
win people's love...

347
00:30:05.167 --> 00:30:07.501 line:82%
...and those who can win
love will never lose.

348
00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:09.667 line:82%
Solid maternal instant.

349
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:12.292 line:82%
- Instinct
- Instant.

350
00:30:12.417 --> 00:30:13.834 line:82%
Okay, what eves...

351
00:30:13.918 --> 00:30:16.959 line:82%
Come, please come, bon appetite.

352
00:30:17.042 --> 00:30:22.167 line:82%
Come, come in.

353
00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:24.292 line:82%
Bon appetite...

354
00:30:24.792 --> 00:30:26.667 line:82%
Bon appetite...

355
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.626 line:82%
Do you come here every Friday?

356
00:30:29.709 --> 00:30:30.959 line:82%
Yes!

357
00:30:31.709 --> 00:30:33.417 line:82%
Just here?

358
00:30:33.501 --> 00:30:37.417 line:82%
No, there's a Bangladeshi
orphanage that I go to on Mondays.

359
00:30:37.501 --> 00:30:39.000 line:82%
And...

360
00:30:39.876 --> 00:30:42.459 line:82%
On Wednesdays I go
to a women's shelter.

361
00:30:42.792 --> 00:30:43.626 line:82%
And...

362
00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:46.209 line:82%
A senior citizens' home on Sundays.

363
00:30:46.292 --> 00:30:47.584 line:82%
And...

364
00:30:49.501 --> 00:30:51.042 line:82%
That's it.

365
00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:53.083 line:82%
That's it...

366
00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:56.042 line:82%
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays,
they're all wasted, very bad.

367
00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:58.042 line:82%
Mother Teresa gave up her
whole life...

368
00:30:58.125 --> 00:31:00.417 line:82%
...oye, explain something
to this girl.

369
00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:03.292 line:82%
Oye, fatty, how much
will you eat, start a diet...

370
00:31:03.375 --> 00:31:05.292 line:82%
...come all, free food
for everyone

371
00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:07.667 line:82%
How much you give is
how much you get.

372
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:09.792 line:82%
I've learnt this in life...

373
00:31:10.292 --> 00:31:13.000 line:82%
...but if everybody keeps asking
for more and no one gives back...

374
00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:15.334 line:82%
...then how will anything be shared?

375
00:31:15.417 --> 00:31:18.209 line:82%
To get something you
have to lose something.

376
00:31:18.626 --> 00:31:20.083 line:82%
Ahh!

377
00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:23.083 line:82%
So that's why you keep making
deals with sir Jesus.

378
00:31:23.167 --> 00:31:28.042 line:82%
Not deals... prayers
that I make earnestly...

379
00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:32.083 line:82%
...and that's why your sir Jesus has
agreed to everything I've told him.

380
00:31:32.167 --> 00:31:35.000 line:82%
Okay, so tell Him to
teach how to sing.

381
00:31:35.459 --> 00:31:38.000 line:82%
Don't worry, I've
already spoken to Him.

382
00:31:38.083 --> 00:31:39.334 line:82%
Really...

383
00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:42.417 line:82%
Sir Jesus knows Punjabi too?

384
00:31:42.501 --> 00:31:45.918 line:82%
O friends, do not call me Heer.

385
00:31:46.042 --> 00:31:48.918 line:82%
I am Sahiban now.

386
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.876 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

387
00:31:54.959 --> 00:31:59.792 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

388
00:32:07.167 --> 00:32:08.834 line:82%
This is so not fair.

389
00:32:08.918 --> 00:32:11.083 line:82%
I've managed to improve
your English so much...

390
00:32:11.292 --> 00:32:13.209 line:82%
...and you're not able to
teach me even one song.

391
00:32:13.292 --> 00:32:15.292 line:82%
You've already learnt
how to sing...

392
00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:16.792 line:82%
...you're also speaking
perfect Punjabi...

393
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.959 line:82%
...the tune is also fine.

394
00:32:18.042 --> 00:32:19.167 line:82%
What's the problem then?

395
00:32:19.292 --> 00:32:22.626 line:82%
The problem is that there
is no joy when you sing...

396
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:23.792 line:82%
...only fear...

397
00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:27.876 line:82%
...you're scared this white
woman will be disturbed...

398
00:32:27.959 --> 00:32:29.417 line:82%
...scared that these
guys playing football...

399
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:31.042 line:82%
...will think you have runaway
from some poor Indian village.

400
00:32:31.125 --> 00:32:33.751 line:82%
Come on, if you can't sing in front
of two or three strangers...

401
00:32:33.834 --> 00:32:35.626 line:82%
...how will you sing to a
hundred people at the party?

402
00:32:35.709 --> 00:32:36.876 line:82%
Oh fu... off!

403
00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:40.000 line:82%
Now this you enjoyed doing.

404
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:42.709 line:82%
Miss Meera Thapar, the girl
you are when you act dignified...

405
00:32:42.792 --> 00:32:44.000 line:82%
...you're not...

406
00:32:44.542 --> 00:32:46.959 line:82%
...you're that girl who sneaks
out to smoke a cigarette...

407
00:32:47.042 --> 00:32:49.834 line:82%
...and keeps cussing this what
the f...? What the f...? word.

408
00:32:50.542 --> 00:32:52.167 line:82%
I am not that girl.

409
00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:54.334 line:82%
I need your phone please...

410
00:32:54.417 --> 00:32:55.459 line:82%
...excuse me...

411
00:32:56.459 --> 00:32:57.501 line:82%
...one second.

412
00:32:58.459 --> 00:33:00.667 line:82%
Hello Maria, Samar this side...

413
00:33:00.751 --> 00:33:05.417 line:82%
...yes I want you to bring a friend
of mine to the tunnel tonight ok...

414
00:33:05.501 --> 00:33:07.167 line:82%
...she will call you...
and Maria...

415
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.834 line:82%
...she is a little shy type
so make her like you...

416
00:33:09.959 --> 00:33:14.042 line:82%
...little sexy, un dos tres, ok bye.

417
00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:16.042 line:82%
Maria works in the restaurant
with me...

418
00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:18.000 line:82%
...and every Sunday night
all of us party together.

419
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:21.501 line:82%
You have the number in your
phone, call her after six.

420
00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:25.667 line:82%
And no one knows you there...

421
00:33:26.375 --> 00:33:29.709 line:82%
...so for just one night
listen to your heart.

422
00:33:30.459 --> 00:33:31.876 line:82%
Why are you doing this?

423
00:33:33.375 --> 00:33:37.542 line:82%
Because I want to show
you who you really are.

424
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.626 line:82%
Un dos tres...

425
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.000 line:82%
Come on babe.

426
00:34:00.167 --> 00:34:01.083 line:82%
Hey Maria!

427
00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:02.375 line:82%
Oh hi.

428
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:03.834 line:82%
What's up?

429
00:34:15.876 --> 00:34:17.584 line:82%
Go get her tiger!

430
00:34:23.334 --> 00:34:24.250 line:82%
Hey Maria!

431
00:34:24.334 --> 00:34:25.542 line:82%
Hi...

432
00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:39.667 line:82%
I'll be right back.

433
00:34:48.834 --> 00:34:50.125 line:82%
Hello...

434
00:34:54.918 --> 00:34:56.042 line:82%
I'm Raj...

435
00:34:58.209 --> 00:34:59.542 line:82%
...you are?

436
00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.375 line:82%
Tina...

437
00:35:05.167 --> 00:35:06.334 line:82%
Italian?

438
00:35:07.501 --> 00:35:08.709 line:82%
Indian.

439
00:35:10.209 --> 00:35:12.000 line:82%
You don't look Indian at all.

440
00:35:13.918 --> 00:35:16.000 line:82%
And you look completely Indian.

441
00:35:16.584 --> 00:35:17.918 line:82%
Why?

442
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:20.459 line:82%
You don't like Indian men?

443
00:35:20.959 --> 00:35:23.417 line:82%
They're very boring.

444
00:35:23.876 --> 00:35:26.667 line:82%
I like a bit of danger in a man.

445
00:35:26.751 --> 00:35:28.834 line:82%
So then this place is
like a buffet for you...

446
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:32.167 line:82%
...and in any case since you've come
they're all just waiting for your cue.

447
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.542 line:82%
Take your pick.

448
00:35:35.292 --> 00:35:36.709 line:82%
I don't see anybody here...

449
00:35:36.751 --> 00:35:39.042 line:82%
...somebody who'd walk
side by side with me...

450
00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:43.501 line:82%
...who'd look into my
eyes and steal my heart.

451
00:35:45.918 --> 00:35:47.918 line:82%
Best of luck, Indian girl.

452
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:53.000 line:82%
Raj...

453
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:57.751 line:82%
You give up too easily.

454
00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.876 line:82%
I wasn't even trying.

455
00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:03.667 line:82%
Why, you don't like me?

456
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:07.501 line:82%
I like you, but at the moment
you're looking for something else.

457
00:36:07.584 --> 00:36:10.375 line:82%
When you get tired
you'll come back here.

458
00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:12.667 line:82%
And if I don't?

459
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.167 line:82%
You'll come.

460
00:36:19.334 --> 00:36:21.918 line:82%
...because for someone
who'd walk by your side...

461
00:36:22.125 --> 00:36:23.918 line:82%
...for someone who'd look
into your eyes...

462
00:36:24.626 --> 00:36:26.709 line:82%
...for someone who'd steal your heart...

463
00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:29.250 line:82%
...there's no one else here.

464
00:40:39.334 --> 00:40:42.501 line:82%
Love is all. Love is sweet.

465
00:40:42.584 --> 00:40:45.751 line:82%
Welcome to the world of love.

466
00:40:45.834 --> 00:40:49.083 line:82%
Love is all. Love is sweet.

467
00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:52.250 line:82%
Welcome to the world of love.

468
00:40:52.501 --> 00:40:55.584 line:82%
Come, look me in the eye.

469
00:40:55.792 --> 00:40:59.125 line:82%
My heart is on fire.

470
00:40:59.209 --> 00:41:02.542 line:82%
Come, just a little closer.

471
00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:05.876 line:82%
Welcome to the world of love.

472
00:41:05.959 --> 00:41:07.709 line:82%
Love is all.

473
00:41:09.125 --> 00:41:11.292 line:82%
Love is sweet.

474
00:41:12.501 --> 00:41:15.751 line:82%
Love is all. Love is sweet.

475
00:41:15.834 --> 00:41:19.334 line:82%
Welcome to the world of love.

476
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:51.876 line:82%
Burning with love is bliss.

477
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.042 line:82%
Let your breath mingle with mine.

478
00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:02.626 line:82%
Tonight is our night of love.

479
00:42:02.709 --> 00:42:05.834 line:82%
Tomorrow it belongs to another.

480
00:42:05.918 --> 00:42:08.918 line:82%
Let's toss the moon like a coin.

481
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.667 line:82%
See what lands, your face or my life.

482
00:42:12.751 --> 00:42:14.918 line:82%
Love is all.

483
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.542 line:82%
Love is sweet.

484
00:42:19.375 --> 00:42:22.375 line:82%
Love is all. Love is sweet.

485
00:42:22.667 --> 00:42:25.959 line:82%
Welcome to the world of love.

486
00:42:26.042 --> 00:42:28.959 line:82%
Come, look me in the eye.

487
00:42:29.334 --> 00:42:32.209 line:82%
My heart is on fire.

488
00:42:32.584 --> 00:42:36.000 line:82%
Come, just a little closer.

489
00:42:36.083 --> 00:42:39.334 line:82%
Welcome to the world of love.

490
00:42:39.417 --> 00:42:41.667 line:82%
Love is all.

491
00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:45.375 line:82%
Love is sweet.

492
00:43:11.501 --> 00:43:17.792 line:82%
Love is an unstoppable river.

493
00:43:18.209 --> 00:43:24.209 line:82%
Float on its waves and see.

494
00:43:24.292 --> 00:43:27.501 line:82%
Step lightly on a cloud.

495
00:43:27.709 --> 00:43:30.959 line:82%
Your feet will find no ground.

496
00:43:31.042 --> 00:43:34.000 line:82%
The heart is without borders.

497
00:43:34.083 --> 00:43:37.751 line:82%
No lines can divide it.

498
00:43:37.834 --> 00:43:39.876 line:82%
Love is all.

499
00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:43.083 line:82%
Love is sweet.

500
00:43:44.501 --> 00:43:47.501 line:82%
Love is all. Love is sweet.

501
00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:51.000 line:82%
Welcome to the world of love.

502
00:43:51.083 --> 00:43:54.083 line:82%
Come, look me in the eye.

503
00:43:54.334 --> 00:43:57.417 line:82%
My heart is on fire.

504
00:43:57.834 --> 00:44:01.083 line:82%
Come, just a little closer.

505
00:44:01.167 --> 00:44:04.417 line:82%
Welcome to the world of love.

506
00:44:04.501 --> 00:44:06.459 line:82%
Love is all.

507
00:44:07.709 --> 00:44:09.876 line:82%
Love is sweet.

508
00:44:11.167 --> 00:44:13.501 line:82%
Love is all.

509
00:44:14.375 --> 00:44:16.542 line:82%
Love is sweet.

510
00:44:17.709 --> 00:44:20.250 line:82%
Love is all.

511
00:44:20.918 --> 00:44:23.501 line:82%
Love is sweet.

512
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:26.918 line:82%

Love is all.

515
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:36.292 line:82%
Love is sweet.

516
00:44:51.626 --> 00:44:54.501 line:82%
I've had the best
time of my life, Samar...

517
00:44:54.584 --> 00:44:56.626 line:82%
...thank you so much...

518
00:44:56.709 --> 00:44:59.334 line:82%
...thank you, thank you, thank you.

519
00:45:00.083 --> 00:45:02.667 line:82%
You know you're actually
this bad ass girl...

520
00:45:02.792 --> 00:45:05.000 line:82%
...how you were born into such a
fancy family, I can't understand.

521
00:45:05.083 --> 00:45:08.250 line:82%
If I'm that bad,
don't be friends with me.

522
00:45:08.334 --> 00:45:10.209 line:82%
Who wants to be friends?

523
00:45:10.292 --> 00:45:13.584 line:82%
Now that I have fallen for you,
what do I do about that?

524
00:45:18.876 --> 00:45:21.751 line:82%
I'm not joking, I
have really fallen in...

525
00:45:22.792 --> 00:45:24.083 line:82%
...love.

526
00:45:28.876 --> 00:45:30.959 line:82%
It's this bad ass behavior of yours...

527
00:45:31.042 --> 00:45:33.542 line:82%
...hiding behind this
well behaved suave person...

528
00:45:35.334 --> 00:45:36.834 line:82%
...that's trapped me.

529
00:45:43.209 --> 00:45:44.292 line:82%
Samar...

530
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:47.751 line:82%
Yes, I know... you're getting
married to that English guy...

531
00:45:47.834 --> 00:45:50.959 line:82%
...and now our contract is also
over so there's no reason to meet.

532
00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:52.334 line:82%
So no tension...

533
00:45:53.292 --> 00:45:56.209 line:82%
...your train's come, you
go your way and I go mine...

534
00:45:56.292 --> 00:45:57.584 line:82%
...the end.

535
00:46:46.375 --> 00:46:49.751 line:82%
This train terminates at Stanborne.

536
00:46:49.834 --> 00:46:51.125 line:82%
Meera...

537
00:46:53.501 --> 00:46:55.292 line:82%
If I kiss you...

538
00:46:56.459 --> 00:46:58.834 line:82%
...will you slap me?

539
00:47:11.042 --> 00:47:13.000 line:82%
I don't think you will slap me.

540
00:48:18.292 --> 00:48:19.959 line:82%
You didn't slap me...

541
00:48:24.417 --> 00:48:26.000 line:82%
...you didn't slap me.

542
00:49:05.334 --> 00:49:08.459 line:82%
O friends, do not call me Heer.

543
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:11.125 line:82%
I am Sahiban now.

544
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:17.292 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

545
00:49:17.501 --> 00:49:21.626 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

546
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:33.626 line:82%
...and abduct me.

547
00:49:34.918 --> 00:49:37.959 line:82%
O friends, do not call me Heer.

548
00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:40.834 line:82%
I am Sahiban now.

549
00:49:41.125 --> 00:49:46.584 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

550
00:49:47.125 --> 00:49:51.834 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

551
00:50:10.501 --> 00:50:13.209 line:82%
I am just like him.
He's just like me.

552
00:50:13.292 --> 00:50:16.250 line:82%
His laughter is like
the morning sunlight.

553
00:50:16.334 --> 00:50:21.334 line:82%
Soothing darkness falls
when he closes his eyes.

554
00:50:22.417 --> 00:50:25.167 line:82%
I am just like him.
He's just like me.

555
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:28.334 line:82%
His laughter is like
the morning sunlight.

556
00:50:28.417 --> 00:50:33.167 line:82%
Soothing darkness falls
when he closes his eyes.

557
00:50:34.209 --> 00:50:39.459 line:82%
I am just like him.
He's just like me.

558
00:50:40.042 --> 00:50:45.459 line:82%
I am just like him.
He's just like me.

559
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:49.334 line:82%
O friends, do not call me Heer.

560
00:50:49.417 --> 00:50:52.334 line:82%
I am Sahiban now.

561
00:50:52.417 --> 00:50:58.000 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

562
00:50:58.292 --> 00:51:02.459 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

563
00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:15.042 line:82%
...and abduct me.

564
00:51:15.667 --> 00:51:18.792 line:82%
O friends, do not call me Heer.

565
00:51:18.876 --> 00:51:21.709 line:82%
I am Sahiban now.

566
00:51:21.959 --> 00:51:27.501 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

567
00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:32.501 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

568
00:51:38.667 --> 00:51:40.626 line:82%
Good evening, Meera.

569
00:51:56.209 --> 00:51:57.501 line:82%
I'm famished.

570
00:51:57.876 --> 00:51:59.417 line:82%
You want to eat?

571
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:14.125 line:82%
Chum va fa.

572
00:52:14.834 --> 00:52:17.834 line:82%
So, Miss Meera Thapar, so
you've also fallen in love.

573
00:52:18.542 --> 00:52:20.542 line:82%
You couldn't live without me
for more than two days, right?

574
00:52:20.626 --> 00:52:25.083 line:82%
Let's do the done done London deal.

575
00:52:28.417 --> 00:52:29.792 line:82%
I am going to get married...
to Roger...

576
00:52:29.834 --> 00:52:31.959 line:82%
...because that's what my
father wants.

577
00:52:35.542 --> 00:52:38.250 line:82%
He's always given me everything
I've ever wanted.

578
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:42.167 line:82%
This is the first time
he's asked something of me.

579
00:52:44.876 --> 00:52:46.792 line:82%
I can't say no to him.

580
00:52:55.417 --> 00:52:58.792 line:82%
My mother left my father and
ran away with someone else.

581
00:53:02.626 --> 00:53:04.501 line:82%
I was twelve then...

582
00:53:07.042 --> 00:53:09.709 line:82%
...my father has taken
care of me by himself.

583
00:53:11.542 --> 00:53:14.292 line:82%
He has always fulfilled my wishes...

584
00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:19.209 line:82%
...we're the only family we have...

585
00:53:20.417 --> 00:53:22.542 line:82%
...there's no one else...

586
00:53:27.375 --> 00:53:32.125 line:82%
I haven't told this to anyone
before now, not even Roger.

587
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:40.542 line:82%
I'm telling you this because
you have to help me.

588
00:54:02.375 --> 00:54:05.083 line:82%
Both of us, have to make a
promise in front of Him...

589
00:54:05.167 --> 00:54:07.250 line:82%
...that we'll remain just friends...

590
00:54:08.209 --> 00:54:11.167 line:82%
...and will never cross this line...

591
00:54:15.209 --> 00:54:17.334 line:82%
...and if we break this promise.

592
00:54:18.542 --> 00:54:21.292 line:82%
He can punish us in
any way He chooses.

593
00:54:27.834 --> 00:54:30.000 line:82%
I can't be friends
with you, Meera...

594
00:54:30.334 --> 00:54:34.083 line:82%
...but don't worry I will
never cross any line...

595
00:54:34.459 --> 00:54:38.584 line:82%
...and for that I don't need to
make any kind of promise to God.

596
00:54:42.542 --> 00:54:44.626 line:82%
This isn't for you, Samar...

597
00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:49.375 line:82%
...this is for me...

598
00:54:51.834 --> 00:54:54.375 line:82%
...so that I don't make any mistake...

599
00:54:57.834 --> 00:54:59.959 line:82%
...so that I may not grow weak...

600
00:55:01.626 --> 00:55:04.250 line:82%
...so that I may not cross the line.

601
00:55:10.042 --> 00:55:11.334 line:82%
Please Samar...

602
00:55:12.918 --> 00:55:14.292 line:82%
...for me.

603
00:55:37.292 --> 00:55:40.167 line:82%
Walk by my side leaving
a space between us.

604
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:43.083 line:82%
Put your heart or hand there.

605
00:55:43.334 --> 00:55:48.292 line:82%
I walk in the shade
cast by your shadow.

606
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:52.125 line:82%
Walk by my side leaving
a space between us.

607
00:55:52.209 --> 00:55:55.000 line:82%
Put your heart or hand there.

608
00:55:55.083 --> 00:56:00.209 line:82%
I walk in the shade
cast by your shadow.

609
00:56:01.083 --> 00:56:06.501 line:82%
I am just like him.
He's just like me.

610
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.292 line:82%
I am just like him.
He's just like me.

611
00:56:12.375 --> 00:56:16.042 line:82%
O friends, do not call me Heer.

612
00:56:16.292 --> 00:56:19.167 line:82%
I am Sahiban now.

613
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:25.083 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

614
00:56:25.167 --> 00:56:35.459 line:82%
...and abduct me.

615
00:56:36.584 --> 00:56:39.918 line:82%
O friends, do not call me Heer.

616
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.751 line:82%
I am Sahiban now.

617
00:56:43.042 --> 00:56:48.709 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

618
00:56:48.959 --> 00:56:53.918 line:82%
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

619
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.542 line:82%
- Good morning ma'am
- Good morning.

620
00:57:02.626 --> 00:57:04.792 line:82%
Here is a parcel for you.

621
00:57:16.792 --> 00:57:18.501 line:82%
My dearest Meera.

622
00:57:18.709 --> 00:57:23.709 line:82%
I read about your marriage in a
magazine and couldn't help myself.

623
00:57:23.834 --> 00:57:26.626 line:82%
It's been so many years
and not one day has gone by...

624
00:57:26.751 --> 00:57:29.292 line:82%
...when I haven't thought of you...

625
00:57:29.417 --> 00:57:35.042 line:82%
...but I promised your father
that I would never contact you.

626
00:57:35.584 --> 00:57:37.626 line:82%
For all your birthdays.

627
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:39.417 line:82%
I'd buy a gift...

628
00:57:39.626 --> 00:57:41.501 line:82%
...and write a long
letter addressed to you...

629
00:57:41.584 --> 00:57:44.209 line:82%
...and then put them both
away in the cupboard...

630
00:57:44.751 --> 00:57:47.334 line:82%
...but this time I couldn't
stop myself.

631
00:57:47.667 --> 00:57:49.626 line:82%
Every mother has a dream...

632
00:57:49.918 --> 00:57:53.000 line:82%
...to dress her daughter in
her wedding sari herself...

633
00:57:53.125 --> 00:57:54.501 line:82%
...but I know that...

634
00:57:54.542 --> 00:57:57.542 line:82%
I lost this right many years ago.

635
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.542 line:82%
The wedding sari that I wore
and came to your father's house.

636
00:58:01.626 --> 00:58:05.459 line:82%
I've kept very carefully
for this day.

637
00:58:05.584 --> 00:58:08.501 line:82%
If you think it is okay, wear it.

638
00:58:08.667 --> 00:58:12.375 line:82%
I will feel like I am also
a part of your wedding.

639
00:58:12.626 --> 00:58:16.000 line:82%
I know that you hate me...

640
00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:18.792 line:82%
...but I pray to God everyday...

641
00:58:19.042 --> 00:58:22.667 line:82%
...hoping that one day
you'll forgive me.

642
00:58:22.959 --> 00:58:24.751 line:82%
Lots and lots of love...

643
00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:27.042 line:82%
...and lots of happiness...

644
00:58:27.167 --> 00:58:29.751 line:82%
...your mother, Pooja.

645
00:58:30.834 --> 00:58:32.834 line:82%
Punjab, as English say...

646
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:36.250 line:82%
Bob Dylan was from there.

647
00:58:36.334 --> 00:58:41.167 line:82%
Babbar Singh Dhillon,
Bob became Bub.

648
00:59:02.667 --> 00:59:04.542 line:82%
So now what do you want to do?

649
00:59:06.501 --> 00:59:07.918 line:82%
I don't know.

650
00:59:09.417 --> 00:59:11.042 line:82%
Meera doesn't know...

651
00:59:11.959 --> 00:59:14.167 line:82%
...but Tina knows what to do.

652
00:59:19.417 --> 00:59:20.751 line:82%
Should we go?

653
01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:13.876 line:82%
What are you doing?

654
01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:16.083 line:82%
The same thing you're doing.

655
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.542 line:82%
Aren't you taking it a
little too easy today?

656
01:00:18.918 --> 01:00:21.292 line:82%
These days you are so busy.

657
01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:24.042 line:82%
I don't get a chance
to spend time with you.

658
01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:27.292 line:82%
Even with you so close to
me you're still not with me...

659
01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:30.250 line:82%
...awaiting your return I
can't see the end of the day.

660
01:00:30.334 --> 01:00:33.334 line:82%
Stop this boring
poetry of yours, Imran.

661
01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:35.000 line:82%
- It's annoying.
- Okay.

662
01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:37.042 line:82%
Miss P! Miss P!

663
01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:39.959 line:82%
Where is the fire, Henry?

664
01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:42.375 line:82%
Someone's waiting for
you at the porch, Miss P.

665
01:00:42.459 --> 01:00:44.292 line:82%
For me?
I've no appointments today.

666
01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.709 line:82%
It's those people
from the restaurant.

667
01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:47.918 line:82%
I told them to come
and sample the wines.

668
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.667 line:82%
So why are they asking for me?

669
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.918 line:82%
Because they're very boring,
like you.

670
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.918 line:82%
I told them I'm mostly out
and they should meet you.

671
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.250 line:82%
It's not funny, Imran.

672
01:00:58.501 --> 01:01:00.334 line:82%
- Listen.
- Hmm?

673
01:01:00.709 --> 01:01:01.834 line:82%
I love you.

674
01:01:01.918 --> 01:01:02.959 line:82%
I know.

675
01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:08.083 line:82%
What's so hehehe, kiddo...

676
01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:11.125 line:82%
...you never said I love
you to a girl before?

677
01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:02.417 line:82%
My baby...

678
01:02:11.584 --> 01:02:12.918 line:82%
My baby...

679
01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:37.584 line:82%
I was 19 years old...

680
01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:40.375 line:82%
...when I married your
father and came from India.

681
01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:43.042 line:82%
Until then I had learnt...

682
01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:46.501 line:82%
...that a girl goes from her
father's home to her husband's...

683
01:02:46.584 --> 01:02:48.751 line:82%
...and that becomes her new life.

684
01:02:49.292 --> 01:02:51.501 line:82%
Your father was a very nice man...

685
01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:55.542 line:82%
...but I could never love him...

686
01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:59.125 line:82%
...and for a long time I didn't
feel like anything was missing.

687
01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:03.876 line:82%
He was busy with his business and
I was busy bringing up my daughter...

688
01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:06.125 line:82%
...and then one day.

689
01:03:06.626 --> 01:03:08.792 line:82%
I met Imran...

690
01:03:09.292 --> 01:03:10.792 line:82%
...and that's when...

691
01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:13.667 line:82%
...you fell in love.

692
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.417 line:82%
Yes, I fell in love.

693
01:03:18.834 --> 01:03:22.501 line:82%
You were four then that's
why I stopped myself...

694
01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:24.834 line:82%
...but when you turned twelve.

695
01:03:26.334 --> 01:03:29.083 line:82%
I gave up...

696
01:03:29.709 --> 01:03:32.626 line:82%
...and I went away with Imran.

697
01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:37.083 line:82%
By then I understood one thing...

698
01:03:37.834 --> 01:03:40.000 line:82%
...if you aren't happy yourself...

699
01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:42.959 line:82%
...you can never keep
others happy...

700
01:03:44.209 --> 01:03:45.375 line:82%
...never.

701
01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.584 line:82%
You know...

702
01:04:00.459 --> 01:04:02.501 line:82%
When I told Imran.

703
01:04:02.542 --> 01:04:05.209 line:82%
I do not want another
child other than you...

704
01:04:05.459 --> 01:04:08.709 line:82%
...he smiled and said that we
didn't need to get married...

705
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:14.250 line:82%
...that he didn't need a piece of
paper or the consent of a priest...

706
01:04:14.334 --> 01:04:16.417 line:82%
...to be with me for life.

707
01:04:17.167 --> 01:04:20.125 line:82%
He's crazy... just like me...

708
01:04:20.501 --> 01:04:23.542 line:82%
...that's probably why we can't
survive without each other.

709
01:04:33.918 --> 01:04:36.876 line:82%
For all these years
I've only hated you.

710
01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:42.959 line:82%
But the fault was also mine...

711
01:04:43.542 --> 01:04:44.709 line:82%
No...

712
01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:47.000 line:82%
It wasn't your fault.

713
01:04:48.334 --> 01:04:51.501 line:82%
A 12-year-old girl
could not understand this...

714
01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:55.125 line:82%
...but a 21-year-old girl can...

715
01:04:55.751 --> 01:04:57.501 line:82%
...that what you did...

716
01:04:58.501 --> 01:05:00.292 line:82%
...was absolutely right.

717
01:05:06.792 --> 01:05:08.501 line:82%
I missed you mama...

718
01:05:10.584 --> 01:05:12.417 line:82%
I missed you so much.

719
01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.709 line:82%
Oh, do you know...

720
01:05:23.792 --> 01:05:26.709 line:82%
...since, childhood I've wished someone
would give me a doll like this?

721
01:05:27.292 --> 01:05:29.083 line:82%
Thank you, Pooja,
thank you very much.

722
01:05:29.167 --> 01:05:30.792 line:82%
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

723
01:05:30.876 --> 01:05:31.792 line:82%
Should I take you for a bike ride?

724
01:05:31.876 --> 01:05:33.167 line:82%
Come on, let's go.

725
01:05:36.209 --> 01:05:37.250 line:82%
Thank you...

726
01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:41.417 line:82%
...you've given mama so much love.

727
01:05:43.209 --> 01:05:45.459 line:82%
I should actually thank you...

728
01:05:45.959 --> 01:05:47.209 line:82%
...it's been many years...

729
01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:50.334 line:82%
...that I've been clowning about,
to make up for your absence...

730
01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:52.584 line:82%
...but now I can retire.

731
01:05:53.959 --> 01:05:56.459 line:82%
Now Pooja will never stop smiling.

732
01:05:57.959 --> 01:06:00.584 line:82%
Thank you for coming
my child, thank you.

733
01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.709 line:82%
Can I ask you one thing?

734
01:06:05.542 --> 01:06:09.375 line:82%
Mama told me you waited
eight years for her...

735
01:06:09.667 --> 01:06:11.584 line:82%
...without any promises.

736
01:06:12.918 --> 01:06:17.167 line:82%
How were you so sure that...
you would be together one day?

737
01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:23.042 line:82%
Every love has its time.
That time was not ours...

738
01:06:23.417 --> 01:06:26.083 line:82%
...but that doesn't mean
it wasn't love.

739
01:06:26.667 --> 01:06:28.876 line:82%
I had faith in my love.

740
01:06:29.584 --> 01:06:32.083 line:82%
If God can bow down
in the face of love...

741
01:06:32.167 --> 01:06:33.501 line:82%
...how does time stand a chance?

742
01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:35.125 line:82%
It had to change...

743
01:06:36.876 --> 01:06:37.751 line:82%
...thank you darling...

744
01:06:39.834 --> 01:06:40.876 line:82%
...thank you.

745
01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:46.167 line:82%
- Cheers Imran.
- Bye.

746
01:06:49.667 --> 01:06:52.542 line:82%
- I love you.
- I know.

747
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:22.501 line:82%
Coffee.

748
01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:28.000 line:82%
I love you.

749
01:07:35.459 --> 01:07:37.250 line:82%
I love you Samar.

750
01:07:42.209 --> 01:07:43.626 line:82%
I love you.

751
01:07:51.751 --> 01:07:54.334 line:82%
You're crossing the line, Meera.

752
01:08:12.501 --> 01:08:14.167 line:82%
I love you.

753
01:08:55.250 --> 01:09:03.959 line:82%
As my breath mingles with yours.

754
01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:14.501 line:82%
I can breathe again.

755
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:27.459 line:82%
As my breath mingles with yours.

756
01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:37.167 line:82%
I can breathe again.

757
01:09:49.209 --> 01:09:55.209 line:82%
The fragrance of your
body touches my soul.

758
01:09:55.501 --> 01:10:04.626 line:82%
If you come near.

759
01:10:39.334 --> 01:10:45.125 line:82%
How long can I control my senses?

760
01:10:45.209 --> 01:10:50.792 line:82%
Let them fly if they will.

761
01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:56.751 line:82%
When has the heart walked
the straight and narrow?

762
01:10:56.959 --> 01:11:02.751 line:82%
Let it wander if it will.

763
01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:08.667 line:82%
Lost in thoughts of you.

764
01:11:08.751 --> 01:11:14.000 line:82%
Solitude pleases me.

765
01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:20.209 line:82%
As my breath mingles with yours.

766
01:11:20.292 --> 01:11:31.083 line:82%
I can breathe again.

767
01:12:33.584 --> 01:12:39.292 line:82%
If the sweet night
is spent by your side.

768
01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:45.083 line:82%
The dawn will break with
light and air.

769
01:12:45.375 --> 01:12:51.209 line:82%
Since my eyes caught sight of you.

770
01:12:51.292 --> 01:12:56.959 line:82%
They brim over with you alone.

771
01:12:57.042 --> 01:13:02.792 line:82%
Touch me again and tell me...

772
01:13:02.876 --> 01:13:08.292 line:82%
...what did you wish for?

773
01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:14.292 line:82%
As my breath mingles with yours.

774
01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:24.918 line:82%
I can breathe again.

775
01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:32.125 line:82%
The fragrance of your
body touches my soul.

776
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:35.167 line:82%
- If you come near.
- I can breathe again.

777
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:37.876 line:82%
- If you come near.
- I can breathe again.

778
01:13:37.959 --> 01:13:42.334 line:82%
- If you come near.
- I can breathe again.

779
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:47.334 line:82%
If you come near.

780
01:14:03.876 --> 01:14:07.042 line:82%
Wish Charlotte a happy
birthday for me, with a kiss.

781
01:14:08.584 --> 01:14:11.834 line:82%
I am going to speak with papa today,
he'll agree, won't he?

782
01:14:11.918 --> 01:14:13.792 line:82%
He'll agree, if he doesn't call me.

783
01:14:13.918 --> 01:14:15.959 line:82%
I'll convince him with a kiss.

784
01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:19.375 line:82%
I'm leaving now, or because
of your papa I'll lose my job.

785
01:14:19.459 --> 01:14:21.459 line:82%
Listen, what about mine...

786
01:14:28.584 --> 01:14:29.751 line:82%
Meera!!

787
01:14:30.042 --> 01:14:31.626 line:82%
I love you.

788
01:14:33.375 --> 01:14:34.501 line:82%
Samar!!

789
01:14:40.792 --> 01:14:41.959 line:82%
Samar!!

790
01:14:48.501 --> 01:14:49.542 line:82%
Madam!

791
01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:52.042 line:82%
Madam you cannot go through.

792
01:14:52.125 --> 01:14:54.876 line:82%
just give me one minute...
please. just give me one minute...

793
01:14:54.918 --> 01:14:56.375 line:82%
just give me one minute...
you don't understand...

794
01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:58.000 line:82%
You cannot come through here.

795
01:14:58.125 --> 01:14:59.417 line:82%
Stay here please...

796
01:15:04.334 --> 01:15:05.876 line:82%
..please, please, please...

797
01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:08.250 line:82%
...please God!

798
01:15:09.792 --> 01:15:11.334 line:82%
...please, please, please...

799
01:15:12.042 --> 01:15:13.292 line:82%
...please don't do this...

800
01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.125 line:82%
...please let him be okay...

801
01:15:15.542 --> 01:15:17.459 line:82%
...don't punish him for my mistake.

802
01:15:23.167 --> 01:15:24.375 line:82%
You keep him alive...

803
01:15:24.542 --> 01:15:27.000 line:82%
...don't let anything
happen to him and I promise.

804
01:15:28.042 --> 01:15:30.334 line:82%
I promise I will never meet him...

805
01:15:31.334 --> 01:15:32.959 line:82%
...please God! Let him be okay.

806
01:15:37.626 --> 01:15:39.250 line:82%
I promise... I promise...

807
01:15:39.626 --> 01:15:41.167 line:82%
Please bring him back...

808
01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:44.209 line:82%
...and I promise You I
will never meet him again...

809
01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:46.918 line:82%
...after this I will never meet him,
please, please, please, God.

810
01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.709 line:82%
I will leave him forever.

811
01:15:48.792 --> 01:15:49.959 line:82%
Sir...

812
01:15:51.459 --> 01:15:54.000 line:82%
...please, bring him back...

813
01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:57.209 line:82%
Okay clear shock!

814
01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:45.584 line:82%
Shit ya, I still can't
get through Meera's phone.

815
01:17:45.959 --> 01:17:47.959 line:82%
For four days she hasn't called,
nor did she come to the hospital.

816
01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:50.042 line:82%
Do you think her father's
upset with her...

817
01:17:50.501 --> 01:17:52.167 line:82%
...did you find out from her store?

818
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:55.042 line:82%
Yes, the guard was saying that
she hasn't come there either.

819
01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:56.417 line:82%
I don't know what the scene is.

820
01:17:56.626 --> 01:17:59.000 line:82%
Son of a... learn to
make a simple cup of tea.

821
01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:00.918 line:82%
My friend, adjust for
one more week...

822
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.709 line:82%
...after that neither
will I be here, nor my tea.

823
01:18:02.792 --> 01:18:05.125 line:82%
Why, you've got a job at
Buckingham Palace, as a guard?

824
01:18:05.959 --> 01:18:07.584 line:82%
No, ya, I am going back to Lahore.

825
01:18:08.042 --> 01:18:10.167 line:82%
Nothing is going to
happen for me in London.

826
01:18:10.584 --> 01:18:12.542 line:82%
Till when will I live off your
money and keep looking for a job?

827
01:18:12.834 --> 01:18:15.667 line:82%
And now Meera is also coming...

828
01:18:15.751 --> 01:18:19.542 line:82%
...so I called my mother and
told her your son is useless...

829
01:18:20.334 --> 01:18:21.459 line:82%
...he's coming back.

830
01:18:21.584 --> 01:18:23.417 line:82%
Oh deal with it, what to do?

831
01:18:24.626 --> 01:18:28.792 line:82%
Kapoor Uncle, come in,
think of it as your home...

832
01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:30.459 line:82%
...oh shucks.

833
01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:34.417 line:82%
Meera!

834
01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:36.667 line:82%
Ahh shucks...

835
01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:43.501 line:82%
I'll... get that tea, that sugar.

836
01:18:43.667 --> 01:18:46.083 line:82%
I'll get something, hello Meera.

837
01:18:46.167 --> 01:18:47.709 line:82%
- Bye
- Bye

838
01:19:04.292 --> 01:19:05.501 line:82%
So papa didn't agree?

839
01:19:07.501 --> 01:19:08.959 line:82%
I didn't speak with him.

840
01:19:09.626 --> 01:19:11.334 line:82%
So what were you doing
all these days?

841
01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.459 line:82%
I was praying.

842
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:18.501 line:82%
To sir Jesus?

843
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:22.667 line:82%
Was it fulfilled?

844
01:19:25.125 --> 01:19:26.334 line:82%
Of course.

845
01:19:28.834 --> 01:19:30.000 line:82%
What did you ask for?

846
01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:32.167 line:82%
Your life.

847
01:19:33.334 --> 01:19:34.792 line:82%
And in return, what did you give up?

848
01:19:36.626 --> 01:19:37.834 line:82%
You!

849
01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:43.834 line:82%
What do you mean?

850
01:19:45.167 --> 01:19:48.042 line:82%
I prayed that He, by
any means, keep you alive...

851
01:19:49.292 --> 01:19:52.000 line:82%
...and in return, the one thing
that is most precious to me,

852
01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:54.834 line:82%
I will leave that...

853
01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:57.667 line:82%
...forever.

854
01:19:59.125 --> 01:20:01.417 line:82%
- You've gone mad?
- Samar, please...

855
01:20:01.918 --> 01:20:04.375 line:82%
...it's been very difficult
for me to come here to you.

856
01:20:05.083 --> 01:20:07.334 line:82%
I realize that you
think all this is rubbish...

857
01:20:07.584 --> 01:20:08.792 line:82%
...you won't understand...

858
01:20:09.417 --> 01:20:10.584 line:82%
...but this is my belief...

859
01:20:10.667 --> 01:20:12.834 line:82%
...that you were punished
for my faults...

860
01:20:13.959 --> 01:20:18.125 line:82%
...that if I remain
with you, your life...

861
01:20:20.667 --> 01:20:23.000 line:82%
...now no one can break this belief...

862
01:20:23.959 --> 01:20:26.125 line:82%
...neither you nor God.

863
01:20:28.292 --> 01:20:29.834 line:82%
I have come here only to tell you...

864
01:20:30.334 --> 01:20:31.876 line:82%
...that I am marrying Roger.

865
01:20:36.501 --> 01:20:38.042 line:82%
I've come to ask you for one thing...

866
01:20:40.042 --> 01:20:42.709 line:82%
...that if possible, leave this city,
and go away somewhere far...

867
01:20:43.375 --> 01:20:44.334 line:82%
...please...

868
01:20:45.876 --> 01:20:47.125 line:82%
...for my sake.

869
01:20:53.876 --> 01:20:55.167 line:82%
You won't say anything?

870
01:21:10.459 --> 01:21:11.751 line:82%
Congratulations...

871
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.584 line:82%
Done, done London.

872
01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:22.167 line:82%
- Samar, I'm sorry...
- Don't...

873
01:21:25.292 --> 01:21:26.459 line:82%
Don't...

874
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.125 line:82%
Don't...

875
01:21:55.417 --> 01:21:57.751 line:82%
Uh, what's this?

876
01:22:08.792 --> 01:22:11.417 line:82%
Call your mother and tell her
that her son is not useless...

877
01:22:11.501 --> 01:22:12.667 line:82%
...that he's not coming back...

878
01:22:12.751 --> 01:22:15.709 line:82%
...and also tell her that her
other son is going back to India...

879
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.584 line:82%
...ask her to pray for him.

880
01:22:18.334 --> 01:22:20.667 line:82%
I am leaving all my money
for you and going.

881
01:22:20.751 --> 01:22:22.125 line:82%
Now make something big out of it.

882
01:22:22.876 --> 01:22:24.876 line:82%
I'll come back one
day to take my share.

883
01:22:26.125 --> 01:22:28.000 line:82%
I'll really miss that tea
of yours...

884
01:22:28.501 --> 01:22:31.209 line:82%
...your friend, Samar, bye.

885
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:50.459 line:82%
This isn't right...

886
01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:53.250 line:82%
...it's all wrong...

887
01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:55.834 line:82%
...completely wrong...

888
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.083 line:82%
...the war between you
and me has begun.

889
01:23:03.042 --> 01:23:04.959 line:82%
You stole my love from me...

890
01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:09.042 line:82%
I'll steal her belief from You.

891
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.334 line:82%
She believes if I am not with her.

892
01:23:14.876 --> 01:23:16.000 line:82%
I will live...

893
01:23:19.626 --> 01:23:21.000 line:82%
So from now on.

894
01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:24.125 line:82%
I will embrace death every day...

895
01:23:29.042 --> 01:23:30.209 line:82%
...let's see...

896
01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:34.209 line:82%
...till how long You keep me alive.

897
01:25:00.167 --> 01:25:01.375 line:82%
Thank you...

898
01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:06.459 line:82%
Samar Anand.

899
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:10.292 line:82%
If you're Samar that means...

900
01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:12.250 line:82%
...there's also a Meera.

901
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:17.501 line:82%
Why didn't you go back?

902
01:25:18.209 --> 01:25:19.417 line:82%
Didn't you meet Meera ever again?

903
01:25:20.584 --> 01:25:23.000 line:82%
Look soldier, I shouldn't
actually involve myself in this...

904
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:24.876 line:82%
...but I am already involved now.

905
01:25:26.083 --> 01:25:29.000 line:82%
You don't know me.

906
01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.501 line:82%
I'm a hardcore, kinda girl.

907
01:25:30.584 --> 01:25:31.834 line:82%
I never cry and all...

908
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:34.751 line:82%
...but your love story
made me fully sentimental

909
01:25:36.751 --> 01:25:39.250 line:82%
Look, I'm this 21 year old...

910
01:25:39.584 --> 01:25:41.042 line:82%
...from this instant make out...

911
01:25:41.167 --> 01:25:42.834 line:82%
...instant breakup generation.

912
01:25:43.167 --> 01:25:45.834 line:82%
First we have sex and then
we think if it was love or not...

913
01:25:46.834 --> 01:25:50.501 line:82%
...with these fundamentals of
love there's solid confusion.

914
01:25:51.834 --> 01:25:55.292 line:82%
Soldier, all I want to know is...

915
01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:57.417 line:82%
...is there such kind of love?

916
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.125 line:82%
...what I mean is...

917
01:25:59.417 --> 01:26:02.667 line:82%
...if it's happened to you it
could happen to anybody...

918
01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:05.501 line:82%
...maybe even me?

919
01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:10.626 line:82%
So tell me now...

920
01:26:11.042 --> 01:26:12.417 line:82%
...was all this true or...

921
01:26:13.125 --> 01:26:14.876 line:82%
...just a story you wrote
to pass time?

922
01:26:16.792 --> 01:26:17.918 line:82%
What's your name?

923
01:26:18.375 --> 01:26:20.250 line:82%
- Akira!
- From Japan?

924
01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:22.709 line:82%
Delhi.

925
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.167 line:82%
You're cool...

926
01:26:24.876 --> 01:26:27.209 line:82%
...consider this a story
and let it go.

927
01:26:28.334 --> 01:26:29.459 line:82%
...you'll remain cool...

928
01:26:40.125 --> 01:26:41.250 line:82%
Arjun...

929
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:43.792 line:82%
...do you love me?

930
01:26:46.792 --> 01:26:48.375 line:82%
Can you wait ten years for me?

931
01:26:50.667 --> 01:26:51.751 line:82%
No?

932
01:26:52.292 --> 01:26:54.417 line:82%
Then you don't stand a chance!
Put the phone down!

933
01:26:57.584 --> 01:26:58.876 line:82%
I give you this, soldier...

934
01:26:59.542 --> 01:27:00.918 line:82%
...if it's love it better be this way!

935
01:27:07.334 --> 01:27:09.292 line:82%
At least let me make
a mock presentation...

936
01:27:09.334 --> 01:27:12.125 line:82%
...you're not going to regret this,
please let me do it.

937
01:27:12.209 --> 01:27:14.292 line:82%
No! no! Akira, I can't allow it.

938
01:27:14.334 --> 01:27:16.542 line:82%
Please, Catherine, it's
the chance of a lifetime.

939
01:27:16.626 --> 01:27:17.834 line:82%
No! It's too dangerous...

940
01:27:17.918 --> 01:27:19.667 line:82%
...you don't have enough experience...

941
01:27:19.751 --> 01:27:20.876 line:82%
...so just forget it.

942
01:27:20.959 --> 01:27:22.584 line:82%
C'mon you lot, get a move on...

943
01:27:23.042 --> 01:27:25.250 line:82%
...it's a wrap, we've
got a flight to catch.

944
01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:29.501 line:82%
Please, Catherine, this is
my dream since I was a kid...

945
01:27:29.584 --> 01:27:31.584 line:82%
...to work for Discovery Channel...
travel...

946
01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:33.250 line:82%
...make films, features...

947
01:27:33.834 --> 01:27:35.334 line:82%
...please let me do it

948
01:27:37.584 --> 01:27:38.751 line:82%
Alright...

949
01:27:39.626 --> 01:27:41.083 line:82%
...two weeks, that's it!

950
01:27:41.334 --> 01:27:42.417 line:82%
And you'll be on your own...

951
01:27:42.584 --> 01:27:44.751 line:82%
...you'll have to do the camera
and the sound by yourself...

952
01:27:44.876 --> 01:27:46.334 line:82%
...and I'm making no promises.

953
01:27:46.626 --> 01:27:47.751 line:82%
I get the first look
at the footage...

954
01:27:47.834 --> 01:27:50.250 line:82%
...and I get to decide if it's
good enough for the channel.

955
01:27:50.959 --> 01:27:52.334 line:82%
Thank you!

956
01:27:52.417 --> 01:27:55.334 line:82%
- Thank you!
- Get off me, you mad woman!

957
01:27:55.626 --> 01:27:57.375 line:82%
I'll speak to General Natarajan.

958
01:27:59.959 --> 01:28:02.167 line:82%
London! Iraq!

959
01:28:02.626 --> 01:28:03.959 line:82%
Afghanistan!

960
01:28:04.334 --> 01:28:06.417 line:82%
Drug wars in Mexico!

961
01:28:06.834 --> 01:28:10.292 line:82%
The whole frigging world...

962
01:28:10.459 --> 01:28:11.834 line:82%
Here comes Akira!

963
01:28:11.918 --> 01:28:13.417 line:82%
Here comes Akira!

964
01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.459 line:82%
General Natarajan called himself.

965
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:22.626 line:82%
This documentary will benefit
the Indian Army a lot.

966
01:28:22.959 --> 01:28:27.167 line:82%
You know how difficult it is to
recruit soldiers for the Bomb Squad.

967
01:28:27.584 --> 01:28:30.501 line:82%
So I felt that by hearing
about stories of your bravery...

968
01:28:30.834 --> 01:28:33.459 line:82%
...by seeing you working, these
youngsters will be motivated...

969
01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:35.792 line:82%
...and want to become like you...

970
01:28:36.751 --> 01:28:39.334 line:82%
...and it's only a matter of
two weeks.

971
01:28:39.584 --> 01:28:41.042 line:82%
I appreciate your support on this.

972
01:28:41.209 --> 01:28:42.334 line:82%
Sir.

973
01:29:03.834 --> 01:29:06.542 line:82%
Akira Rai, Discovery Channel,
reporting for duty, sir.

974
01:29:07.751 --> 01:29:08.959 line:82%
Is this stolen or for real?

975
01:29:09.501 --> 01:29:11.334 line:82%
It's a 100% authentic soldier...

976
01:29:11.501 --> 01:29:15.083 line:82%
...now for two weeks,
wherever you go, I go.

977
01:29:18.375 --> 01:29:19.792 line:82%
How many more have
come to die with you?

978
01:29:19.876 --> 01:29:21.876 line:82%
Just me, One Woman Crew.

979
01:29:29.209 --> 01:29:30.375 line:82%
C'mon eat...

980
01:29:31.459 --> 01:29:33.918 line:82%
- Hello, I'm Captain Kamal Singh!
- Singh!

981
01:29:33.959 --> 01:29:36.542 line:82%
- And I'm Captain Jagdeep Dewan!
- Dewan!

982
01:29:36.626 --> 01:29:37.918 line:82%
Lieutenant Hari Krishnan, madam.

983
01:29:38.292 --> 01:29:40.918 line:82%
You can stop this formality
of calling me madam.

984
01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:43.125 line:82%
I'm Akira, short and sweet Akira.

985
01:29:43.209 --> 01:29:45.250 line:82%
- Hello, Akira!
- Now that's perfect

986
01:29:45.459 --> 01:29:49.626 line:82%
Now look, for the next two weeks
I am going to trouble you a lot...

987
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:51.334 line:82%
...so for speaking excessively,
for eating excessively...

988
01:29:51.375 --> 01:29:52.584 line:82%
...and for abusing uncontrollably.

989
01:29:52.667 --> 01:29:53.918 line:82%
I ask you'll to forgive me now.

990
01:29:54.501 --> 01:29:55.709 line:82%
I have one question.

991
01:29:55.792 --> 01:29:58.375 line:82%
I just hope that you aren't
as grumpy as your boss.

992
01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:01.209 line:82%
No, no, not at all,
we are very jolly guys.

993
01:30:01.292 --> 01:30:04.042 line:82%
Then I am afraid we are going
to have a lot of fun, guys.

994
01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:05.667 line:82%
By the way, where do
I dump this stuff?

995
01:30:05.751 --> 01:30:07.959 line:82%
I will show you, I will show you.

996
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:14.584 line:82%
Make sure the distance
is maintained.

997
01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:23.083 line:82%
Miss Akira Rai.

998
01:30:24.626 --> 01:30:26.459 line:82%
Akira Rai reporting for duty, sir.

999
01:30:27.083 --> 01:30:29.334 line:82%
This action-packed army
life is really exciting.

1000
01:30:29.667 --> 01:30:31.292 line:82%
You will always remain
behind this barricade...

1001
01:30:31.334 --> 01:30:32.959 line:82%
...and 350 meters behind me.

1002
01:30:33.292 --> 01:30:36.834 line:82%
If you break any rule you'll be
sent back to barracks, any doubts?

1003
01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:41.584 line:82%
Can I listen to music on my IPod?

1004
01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:45.334 line:82%
Is that a yes or no?

1005
01:30:56.292 --> 01:30:57.584 line:82%
Oh man.

1006
01:30:59.417 --> 01:31:01.125 line:82%
- Daisy Chain uh...
- Yes sir.

1007
01:31:06.334 --> 01:31:07.584 line:82%
Safe to disable cap.

1008
01:31:07.709 --> 01:31:09.042 line:82%
Yes sir, I've checked it.

1009
01:31:16.209 --> 01:31:17.876 line:82%
I think there might be
another switch Dewan.

1010
01:31:17.959 --> 01:31:19.083 line:82%
Quite possible.

1011
01:31:19.751 --> 01:31:20.959 line:82%
In sequence.

1012
01:31:22.584 --> 01:31:24.083 line:82%
Cut cap.

1013
01:31:25.626 --> 01:31:27.626 line:82%
- Go in sequence.
- Okay sir.

1014
01:31:31.918 --> 01:31:33.167 line:82%
Where is this going?

1015
01:31:33.417 --> 01:31:34.626 line:82%
No idea sir.

1016
01:31:35.667 --> 01:31:36.751 line:82%
Let me check this.

1017
01:31:50.501 --> 01:31:52.209 line:82%
- Lowering seat.
- Okay sir.

1018
01:32:02.042 --> 01:32:03.959 line:82%
- There's a switch Dewan.
- Be careful sir.

1019
01:32:39.375 --> 01:32:40.501 line:82%
Akira!!

1020
01:32:45.834 --> 01:32:47.042 line:82%
Akira!!

1021
01:33:16.042 --> 01:33:17.375 line:82%
- Are you okay.
- Are you okay.

1022
01:33:18.584 --> 01:33:19.751 line:82%
Are you okay.

1023
01:33:23.918 --> 01:33:26.334 line:82%
What did you think was
going on, some film shoot...

1024
01:33:26.626 --> 01:33:27.751 line:82%
...or some kind of adventure trip...

1025
01:33:27.834 --> 01:33:29.792 line:82%
...that you'll go home and
show off to your friends?

1026
01:33:30.417 --> 01:33:32.459 line:82%
We are dealing with
bloody bombs here.

1027
01:33:32.834 --> 01:33:35.083 line:82%
Today, because of you, the lives
of my entire team was compromised.

1028
01:33:36.334 --> 01:33:39.626 line:82%
- I'm sorry.
- 350 meters I said.

1029
01:33:41.042 --> 01:33:44.042 line:82%
Now you will not come with us,
you'll go back from here.

1030
01:33:45.542 --> 01:33:48.542 line:82%
No, soldier, I am not going back,
I am coming with you.

1031
01:33:48.626 --> 01:33:50.542 line:82%
The road ahead is dangerous,
you will not be able to manage.

1032
01:33:50.626 --> 01:33:52.334 line:82%
Soldier, this is my life's
one and only chance...

1033
01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:53.542 line:82%
I'll cope with anything.

1034
01:33:53.626 --> 01:33:55.250 line:82%
- Please, I am sorry!
- Akira!

1035
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:59.459 line:82%
Look, you're an okay girl,
you're brave too...

1036
01:34:00.292 --> 01:34:02.334 line:82%
...but this is not possible
for untrained girls or boys.

1037
01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:06.083 line:82%
Listen to me and...
forget this story.

1038
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:09.626 line:82%
If I asked you to forget Meera,
will you forget her?

1039
01:34:13.167 --> 01:34:16.083 line:82%
There is always this one passion,
that a person has...

1040
01:34:17.042 --> 01:34:18.209 line:82%
...for you it's Meera...

1041
01:34:18.501 --> 01:34:20.042 line:82%
...for me my passion is your story.

1042
01:34:20.959 --> 01:34:22.125 line:82%
I'm not going!

1043
01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:51.876 line:82%
Sorry.

1044
01:34:58.709 --> 01:35:00.751 line:82%
Oh Krishnan! Where is sir going?

1045
01:35:00.834 --> 01:35:03.334 line:82%
Sir always goes for some quiet
time after defusing a bomb.

1046
01:35:03.459 --> 01:35:04.542 line:82%
Quiet!

1047
01:35:08.334 --> 01:35:12.042 line:82%
O Akira, never mess around
with a lion that's sleeping.

1048
01:35:12.459 --> 01:35:15.417 line:82%
O Singhe, I haven't
come here to shoot birds.

1049
01:35:15.667 --> 01:35:17.083 line:82%
I've come here to shoot the Lion.

1050
01:35:17.459 --> 01:35:19.292 line:82%
And this Lion I will shoot for sure.

1051
01:35:19.667 --> 01:35:20.751 line:82%
- Dewan.
- Yes.

1052
01:35:20.792 --> 01:35:24.000 line:82%
Keep the chicken cooking,
I'll be back in a bit.

1053
01:35:31.209 --> 01:35:35.042 line:82%
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1054
01:35:37.292 --> 01:35:41.334 line:82%
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1055
01:35:41.375 --> 01:35:45.334 line:82%
Where is my home?

1056
01:35:45.417 --> 01:35:48.584 line:82%
He asks every passer-by.

1057
01:35:48.667 --> 01:35:50.792 line:82%
Wanders with a smile...

1058
01:35:50.876 --> 01:35:52.751 line:82%
...and a tear.

1059
01:35:52.834 --> 01:35:56.125 line:82%
Wanders aimless from street to street.

1060
01:35:56.876 --> 01:35:58.876 line:82%
Belonging to all.

1061
01:35:58.959 --> 01:36:00.876 line:82%
Yet none to call my own.

1062
01:36:00.959 --> 01:36:04.334 line:82%
Wanders aimless from street to street.

1063
01:36:05.792 --> 01:36:10.667 line:82%
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1064
01:36:11.876 --> 01:36:15.876 line:82%
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1065
01:36:15.959 --> 01:36:19.918 line:82%
Where is my home?

1066
01:36:20.083 --> 01:36:23.167 line:82%
He asks every passer-by.

1067
01:36:24.334 --> 01:36:30.125 line:82%
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1068
01:36:32.918 --> 01:36:34.959 line:82%
You play around with bombs
in the day...

1069
01:36:36.417 --> 01:36:38.250 line:82%
...and sing romantic songs by night.

1070
01:36:40.417 --> 01:36:41.959 line:82%
How is it possible not
to fall in love with you?

1071
01:36:43.334 --> 01:36:44.459 line:82%
You wait...

1072
01:36:45.042 --> 01:36:47.584 line:82%
...in two weeks you will sing
Punjabi songs for Akira...

1073
01:36:48.209 --> 01:36:49.542 line:82%
...this is my challenge...

1074
01:36:50.501 --> 01:36:52.667 line:82%
...good night, sexy.

1075
01:37:21.959 --> 01:37:26.042 line:82%
- What the...
- Sorry... ball! Sorry... ball.

1076
01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:30.083 line:82%
Afzal.

1077
01:37:30.584 --> 01:37:32.042 line:82%
Pass..

1078
01:37:50.167 --> 01:37:52.792 line:82%
Oh shucks, the camera broke.

1079
01:37:58.834 --> 01:38:02.167 line:82%
No ya, Akira,
now this will not work...

1080
01:38:03.125 --> 01:38:04.959 line:82%
...and we won't get these
parts even in Jammu...

1081
01:38:05.834 --> 01:38:08.042 line:82%
...this can be fixed only in Delhi.

1082
01:38:10.626 --> 01:38:11.834 line:82%
I'm sorry, Akira I'm... I'm...

1083
01:38:11.918 --> 01:38:14.042 line:82%
Hey it's okay, Krishnan,
it's not your fault.

1084
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:15.292 line:82%
After seeing my Messi like kick...

1085
01:38:15.334 --> 01:38:16.584 line:82%
...anybody would have
dropped the camera...

1086
01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:20.709 line:82%
...and in any case where was
Discovery Channel going to take me?

1087
01:38:21.167 --> 01:38:23.250 line:82%
It was just a one-off
chance I was taking.

1088
01:38:23.959 --> 01:38:25.834 line:82%
Okay good night.

1089
01:38:34.167 --> 01:38:35.375 line:82%
Soldier.

1090
01:38:36.459 --> 01:38:38.584 line:82%
Akira's entertainment
was only till here...

1091
01:38:39.042 --> 01:38:41.125 line:82%
...tomorrow morning it's about-turn,
back to Delhi...

1092
01:38:41.876 --> 01:38:43.292 line:82%
...finally you get rid of me...

1093
01:38:43.334 --> 01:38:45.042 line:82%
...at least now give me
one sexy smile.

1094
01:38:48.209 --> 01:38:49.542 line:82%
Fine then, remain grumpy...

1095
01:38:49.959 --> 01:38:52.667 line:82%
Oye, Akira, at least eat your food.

1096
01:38:53.417 --> 01:38:54.834 line:82%
No ya, Singhe, I'm not hungry.

1097
01:38:57.501 --> 01:38:58.584 line:82%
Both of you'll eat.

1098
01:38:59.542 --> 01:39:00.626 line:82%
No sir.

1099
01:39:03.959 --> 01:39:05.209 line:82%
Fine don't eat.

1100
01:39:17.792 --> 01:39:19.375 line:82%
Akira! Smile...

1101
01:39:19.459 --> 01:39:20.709 line:82%
And now we have.

1102
01:39:20.751 --> 01:39:24.042 line:82%
Discovery Channel's Oscar-winning
film-maker miss Akira Rai...

1103
01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:25.584 line:82%
...a few words for your fans...

1104
01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:26.709 line:82%
Hey! How is it fixed?

1105
01:39:26.792 --> 01:39:29.792 line:82%
Samar did it, he's
an electronics genius...

1106
01:39:29.876 --> 01:39:31.125 line:82%
...he worked all night on it.

1107
01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:34.334 line:82%
Where's that genius?

1108
01:39:44.125 --> 01:39:45.834 line:82%
Why are you so complicated?

1109
01:39:46.501 --> 01:39:49.501 line:82%
Neither can one fully
hate you nor love you.

1110
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:53.751 line:82%
Actually I've understood now...

1111
01:39:54.167 --> 01:39:57.209 line:82%
...after seeing me in my swimsuit,
you've changed your mind...

1112
01:39:57.792 --> 01:39:59.042 line:82%
...now I've started looking
hot to you, right?

1113
01:40:01.876 --> 01:40:04.167 line:82%
Don't give me such
intense looks, soldier...

1114
01:40:04.459 --> 01:40:07.125 line:82%
...it fills me with this
weird kind of sensation.

1115
01:40:07.209 --> 01:40:09.709 line:82%
Stop talking rubbish or
I'll break the camera again.

1116
01:40:10.334 --> 01:40:13.667 line:82%
First tell me... why did you stay
up all night and fix my camera?

1117
01:40:18.792 --> 01:40:20.292 line:82%
You spoke about passion.

1118
01:40:21.584 --> 01:40:23.667 line:82%
When someone is passionate about
something and doesn't get it...

1119
01:40:24.918 --> 01:40:27.209 line:82%
...he spends a lifetime
going mad chasing it.

1120
01:40:29.042 --> 01:40:30.876 line:82%
There's one mad man
standing in front of you...

1121
01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:34.334 line:82%
...there is no place here
for another mad person...

1122
01:40:36.334 --> 01:40:39.918 line:82%
...so pick your camera,
fulfill your passion...

1123
01:40:40.876 --> 01:40:41.834 line:82%
...and leave.

1124
01:40:46.459 --> 01:40:50.626 line:82%
Try as hard as you can, you
won't save me from going mad.

1125
01:40:53.292 --> 01:40:55.125 line:82%
Towards me, more towards me...

1126
01:40:55.209 --> 01:40:56.709 line:82%
...nice, nice.

1127
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:59.334 line:82%
A little bit, a little bit.

1128
01:41:00.042 --> 01:41:01.334 line:82%
Let me see the device.

1129
01:41:01.792 --> 01:41:03.709 line:82%
Yup! Exactly!

1130
01:41:09.083 --> 01:41:11.626 line:82%
- What's happened, Dewan? - Sir, it's
bang in the center of the bridge.

1131
01:41:11.918 --> 01:41:13.542 line:82%
- Any timer?
- Yes, sir.

1132
01:41:13.709 --> 01:41:15.959 line:82%
And the wires to go to the
dynamite through the relay.

1133
01:41:16.334 --> 01:41:18.125 line:82%
They're wrapped around
cans filled with Anfo.

1134
01:41:18.209 --> 01:41:19.334 line:82%
Ya.

1135
01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:22.209 line:82%
Oye Kurusawa...

1136
01:41:23.334 --> 01:41:26.042 line:82%
...come fulfill your passion.

1137
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.834 line:82%
Wow great!

1138
01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:39.250 line:82%
You're not scared?

1139
01:41:40.334 --> 01:41:42.626 line:82%
I'm hanging here with
'The man who cannot die'...

1140
01:41:43.584 --> 01:41:44.626 line:82%
...literally!

1141
01:41:45.209 --> 01:41:46.834 line:82%
There's no chance of being scared...

1142
01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:49.751 line:82%
...your destiny is working on
a strike rate of 100%, boss.

1143
01:41:50.667 --> 01:41:53.626 line:82%
In our line of work destiny
betrays you just once.

1144
01:41:54.334 --> 01:41:56.417 line:82%
Don't worry,
today's not that day...

1145
01:41:56.876 --> 01:41:59.626 line:82%
...'cause I have no plans
of dying so quickly.

1146
01:41:59.876 --> 01:42:01.959 line:82%
I have to make many more
documentaries...

1147
01:42:02.167 --> 01:42:03.918 line:82%
...and show them in every
country in the world.

1148
01:42:03.959 --> 01:42:06.292 line:82%
I have to have sex with
guys with different accents.

1149
01:42:07.834 --> 01:42:09.501 line:82%
Did you grow up reading
the Kama Sutra?

1150
01:42:10.042 --> 01:42:11.250 line:82%
Is this all you think of?

1151
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:15.042 line:82%
Soldier, at my age,
this is all we think of.

1152
01:42:15.209 --> 01:42:17.751 line:82%
When I grow older like you,
I'll start thinking of love.

1153
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.042 line:82%
Being a good citizen,
the ways of God, okay?

1154
01:42:22.501 --> 01:42:23.667 line:82%
Okay.

1155
01:42:27.375 --> 01:42:28.459 line:82%
By the way, soldier...

1156
01:42:29.250 --> 01:42:32.042 line:82%
...do you plan on being in
love with Meera all your life...

1157
01:42:32.125 --> 01:42:34.083 line:82%
...or is there a chance for
someone else in between?

1158
01:42:37.375 --> 01:42:40.125 line:82%
There's a mind blowing offer,
do you want to hear it?

1159
01:42:41.334 --> 01:42:42.792 line:82%
- Is there a choice?
- No

1160
01:42:43.167 --> 01:42:44.334 line:82%
Make me your girlfriend.

1161
01:42:46.083 --> 01:42:47.250 line:82%
Why?

1162
01:42:47.334 --> 01:42:50.959 line:82%
I'm young... I'm entertaining...
I'm sexy...

1163
01:42:51.209 --> 01:42:52.709 line:82%
...you've already checked
my body out...

1164
01:42:52.918 --> 01:42:55.334 line:82%
...actually I'm like a jackpot
for you...

1165
01:42:55.501 --> 01:42:57.292 line:82%
...it's a limited offer...
think about it.

1166
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:05.083 line:82%
Soldier, soldier, listen...

1167
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:09.918 line:82%
I never ask God for anything...

1168
01:43:10.125 --> 01:43:11.292 line:82%
...so by making promises and all...

1169
01:43:11.334 --> 01:43:13.417 line:82%
...and leaving you is out
of the question.

1170
01:43:19.501 --> 01:43:21.584 line:82%
I made you laugh, you're mine now.

1171
01:43:54.667 --> 01:44:02.626 line:82%
Away I go, carried on wings
of passion.

1172
01:44:03.959 --> 01:44:11.751 line:82%
Drinking droplets of time.

1173
01:44:13.042 --> 01:44:17.417 line:82%
My heart has flown from its cage.

1174
01:44:17.501 --> 01:44:21.375 line:82%
Falling in love with myself.

1175
01:44:21.792 --> 01:44:24.125 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1176
01:44:24.209 --> 01:44:26.334 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1177
01:44:26.584 --> 01:44:28.626 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1178
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:29.834 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1179
01:44:31.501 --> 01:44:33.250 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1180
01:44:33.334 --> 01:44:35.501 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1181
01:44:35.667 --> 01:44:37.751 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1182
01:44:37.834 --> 01:44:38.959 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1183
01:44:40.042 --> 01:44:47.959 line:82%
Away I go, carried on
wings of passion.

1184
01:44:49.292 --> 01:44:53.542 line:82%
My heart has flown from its cage.

1185
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:57.959 line:82%
Falling in love with myself.

1186
01:44:58.083 --> 01:45:00.417 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1187
01:45:00.501 --> 01:45:02.626 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1188
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:04.918 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1189
01:45:04.959 --> 01:45:06.167 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1190
01:45:07.709 --> 01:45:09.417 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1191
01:45:09.501 --> 01:45:11.709 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1192
01:45:11.792 --> 01:45:13.959 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1193
01:45:14.083 --> 01:45:15.250 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1194
01:45:47.584 --> 01:45:56.167 line:82%
Clasping the moment in your
fingertips like a butterfly.

1195
01:45:56.542 --> 01:46:04.959 line:82%
As it takes wing it
leaves traces of color.

1196
01:46:06.501 --> 01:46:15.250 line:82%
The moment moves on,
leaving its color behind, Akira.

1197
01:46:15.667 --> 01:46:23.792 line:82%
I clasp another
moment as it takes flight.

1198
01:46:24.209 --> 01:46:26.459 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1199
01:46:26.584 --> 01:46:28.876 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1200
01:46:28.959 --> 01:46:31.042 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1201
01:46:31.125 --> 01:46:32.250 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1202
01:46:33.834 --> 01:46:35.584 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1203
01:46:35.667 --> 01:46:37.918 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1204
01:46:38.042 --> 01:46:40.167 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1205
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:41.334 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1206
01:46:42.375 --> 01:46:50.417 line:82%
Away I go, carried
on wings of passion.

1207
01:46:51.626 --> 01:46:56.083 line:82%
My heart has flown from its cage.

1208
01:46:56.209 --> 01:47:00.459 line:82%
Falling in love with myself.

1209
01:47:03.959 --> 01:47:06.417 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1210
01:47:06.501 --> 01:47:08.667 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1211
01:47:08.751 --> 01:47:10.959 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1212
01:47:11.042 --> 01:47:12.167 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1213
01:47:13.667 --> 01:47:15.459 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1214
01:47:15.542 --> 01:47:17.876 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1215
01:47:17.959 --> 01:47:20.042 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1216
01:47:20.125 --> 01:47:21.250 line:82%
Embracing life with open arms.

1217
01:47:33.667 --> 01:47:34.918 line:82%
So Major Samar Anand...

1218
01:47:35.834 --> 01:47:37.209 line:82%
...the last question of our trip...

1219
01:47:38.876 --> 01:47:40.876 line:82%
...why haven't you worn
a bomb suit till now?

1220
01:47:43.542 --> 01:47:44.584 line:82%
Um...

1221
01:47:46.083 --> 01:47:48.167 line:82%
Bomb suits are meant to
protect you from danger...

1222
01:47:49.334 --> 01:47:52.125 line:82%
...to protect you from getting
hurt, or being wounded...

1223
01:47:54.083 --> 01:47:56.334 line:82%
...but more than bombs
it's life, that hurts you...

1224
01:47:57.751 --> 01:48:00.959 line:82%
...at every corner there's betrayal,
some pain...

1225
01:48:04.083 --> 01:48:07.250 line:82%
...so if we don't wear bomb suits to
save us from the dangers of life...

1226
01:48:09.459 --> 01:48:11.250 line:82%
...what's the point of wearing it
to save us from death?

1227
01:48:14.125 --> 01:48:16.250 line:82%
Every day, life kills us a little...

1228
01:48:17.834 --> 01:48:19.501 line:82%
...a bomb will kill us just once.

1229
01:48:29.459 --> 01:48:32.042 line:82%
Okay soldier, that's a wrap...

1230
01:48:32.459 --> 01:48:35.584 line:82%
...the end of my film
and your torture.

1231
01:48:42.584 --> 01:48:43.792 line:82%
Are you checking me out?

1232
01:48:44.876 --> 01:48:46.959 line:82%
I was thinking how
wrong I was about you.

1233
01:48:47.959 --> 01:48:50.334 line:82%
I'd thought that you wouldn't
last more than two days with us...

1234
01:48:51.667 --> 01:48:53.334 line:82%
...but you turned to be
really tough boss.

1235
01:48:54.417 --> 01:48:56.751 line:82%
Have you ever asked me
anything about myself?

1236
01:48:57.083 --> 01:48:58.959 line:82%
All you gave were intense
angry looks.

1237
01:48:59.667 --> 01:49:03.042 line:82%
I'm a national level swimmer,
a state level tennis player.

1238
01:49:03.375 --> 01:49:05.209 line:82%
I can run a kilometer
in four minutes.

1239
01:49:05.667 --> 01:49:06.834 line:82%
I'm a deep sea diver...

1240
01:49:06.918 --> 01:49:08.542 line:82%
...basically I'm Super Girl,
make me do anything.

1241
01:49:09.667 --> 01:49:12.292 line:82%
So, there's nothing that
you can't do?

1242
01:49:14.334 --> 01:49:15.667 line:82%
There's one thing.

1243
01:49:16.834 --> 01:49:17.959 line:82%
What?

1244
01:49:18.918 --> 01:49:20.334 line:82%
I couldn't make you fall for me.

1245
01:49:22.209 --> 01:49:23.125 line:82%
There, you've started again.

1246
01:49:25.167 --> 01:49:26.459 line:82%
I'm in love with you, Samar.

1247
01:49:33.334 --> 01:49:36.876 line:82%
Totally, completely, madly.

1248
01:49:38.125 --> 01:49:39.667 line:82%
Akira has fallen flat
in love with you.

1249
01:49:46.501 --> 01:49:47.876 line:82%
There's no need to say anything.

1250
01:49:48.667 --> 01:49:52.459 line:82%
I know you're not at all interested,
and it's... it's totally cool.

1251
01:49:54.083 --> 01:49:56.209 line:82%
Until now, boys have
always run after me.

1252
01:49:57.125 --> 01:49:58.918 line:82%
I've never run after anybody...

1253
01:50:03.209 --> 01:50:04.542 line:82%
...but you're this special piece, ya.

1254
01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:09.292 line:82%
In my generation I'll never
find a lover like you...

1255
01:50:10.334 --> 01:50:12.083 line:82%
...and now that I've met you.

1256
01:50:12.751 --> 01:50:14.542 line:82%
I can't love someone
lesser than you...

1257
01:50:16.542 --> 01:50:20.083 line:82%
...so basically, I'm screwed, boss.

1258
01:50:35.334 --> 01:50:37.334 line:82%
You deliver dialogues
just like me...

1259
01:50:37.918 --> 01:50:38.959 line:82%
...just...

1260
01:50:39.834 --> 01:50:41.626 line:82%
...don't end up falling
in love like me...

1261
01:50:44.918 --> 01:50:49.417 line:82%
...because if your laughter, this
mischief, this abusive language, stops...

1262
01:50:53.083 --> 01:50:54.959 line:82%
...this world will surely
loose something.

1263
01:51:16.542 --> 01:51:19.250 line:82%
Where do these come from?

1264
01:51:22.501 --> 01:51:24.167 line:82%
Krishnan!
See you, Akira.

1265
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:26.417 line:82%
Dewan!

1266
01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:30.334 line:82%
Bye Singhe.

1267
01:51:30.417 --> 01:51:31.542 line:82%
Take care, Akira.

1268
01:51:41.709 --> 01:51:43.959 line:82%
Don't worry, I'm not going to cry.

1269
01:51:44.083 --> 01:51:46.459 line:82%
Ya ya, I know, you're super girl.

1270
01:51:46.542 --> 01:51:47.667 line:82%
That I am.

1271
01:51:51.209 --> 01:51:52.542 line:82%
Take care of yourself...

1272
01:51:53.501 --> 01:51:54.626 line:82%
...don't die or anything like that...

1273
01:51:55.167 --> 01:51:56.918 line:82%
...ours is going to be
a deadly love story.

1274
01:51:57.626 --> 01:51:58.876 line:82%
You're not going to change.

1275
01:52:00.042 --> 01:52:01.375 line:82%
There's no chance.

1276
01:52:06.250 --> 01:52:07.501 line:82%
I don't want these friendly hugs...

1277
01:52:07.584 --> 01:52:08.709 line:82%
...if you want to kiss me,
then do that.

1278
01:52:27.667 --> 01:52:28.709 line:82%
This was a kiss?

1279
01:52:29.334 --> 01:52:30.709 line:82%
That's how the army's taught us.

1280
01:52:31.417 --> 01:52:32.417 line:82%
You wait...

1281
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:34.667 line:82%
...let me come back, and show
you how to kiss for real.

1282
01:52:35.042 --> 01:52:35.959 line:82%
Really?

1283
01:52:37.542 --> 01:52:38.626 line:82%
I'll see you...

1284
01:52:54.751 --> 01:52:56.667 line:82%
Come on, we have to reach
Baramullah in one hour...

1285
01:52:57.334 --> 01:52:58.626 line:82%
...control your emotions...

1286
01:52:59.542 --> 01:53:01.292 line:82%
...otherwise the bomb
will be out of control.

1287
01:53:13.209 --> 01:53:16.709 line:82%
So if we don't wear bomb suits to
save us from the dangers of life...

1288
01:53:18.626 --> 01:53:20.667 line:82%
...what's the point of wearing it
to save us from death?

1289
01:53:23.292 --> 01:53:25.459 line:82%
Every day, life kills us a little...

1290
01:53:27.083 --> 01:53:28.542 line:82%
...a bomb will kill us just once.

1291
01:53:48.167 --> 01:53:50.042 line:82%
You made the bitch cry!

1292
01:53:52.918 --> 01:53:53.959 line:82%
I love it!

1293
01:53:54.751 --> 01:53:56.209 line:82%
I'm going to make sure
they run this.

1294
01:53:59.125 --> 01:54:02.334 line:82%
Get off me you stupid girl
before I change my mind.

1295
01:54:02.417 --> 01:54:04.709 line:82%
We are going to title it
'The Man Who Cannot Die.'

1296
01:54:04.792 --> 01:54:06.542 line:82%
I want it to be the lead
for the September issue...

1297
01:54:06.626 --> 01:54:08.209 line:82%
...so Akira, put him on a flight...

1298
01:54:08.292 --> 01:54:09.918 line:82%
...and get him to London
as soon as possible...

1299
01:54:09.959 --> 01:54:11.834 line:82%
...the big boys will want
to authenticate his story.

1300
01:54:12.125 --> 01:54:13.501 line:82%
Does he have to come here for that?

1301
01:54:13.584 --> 01:54:15.042 line:82%
I mean, Can't we just do
this there?

1302
01:54:15.292 --> 01:54:17.584 line:82%
For a story done by a rookie,
no, just get him here.

1303
01:54:17.667 --> 01:54:18.751 line:82%
He won't come!

1304
01:54:19.709 --> 01:54:20.792 line:82%
Why the hell not?

1305
01:54:21.042 --> 01:54:23.125 line:82%
He just won't.

1306
01:54:23.626 --> 01:54:25.959 line:82%
Listen girl, I don't run
this company...

1307
01:54:26.042 --> 01:54:28.542 line:82%
...but I do know that if he
doesn't get his arce over here...

1308
01:54:28.626 --> 01:54:30.334 line:82%
...your story stays
in the edit room...

1309
01:54:30.792 --> 01:54:33.042 line:82%
...you've got 24 hours
to get back to me.

1310
01:54:39.334 --> 01:54:40.501 line:82%
In the name of God!

1311
01:54:41.083 --> 01:54:45.501 line:82%
Soldier, they've flipped
it after seeing your story...

1312
01:54:45.918 --> 01:54:48.876 line:82%
...they want to make it the cover
story for the September issue...

1313
01:54:49.125 --> 01:54:51.667 line:82%
...and sign me for a starting
salary of 25 thousand quid...

1314
01:54:51.751 --> 01:54:53.375 line:82%
...and a three-3 year contract.

1315
01:54:53.584 --> 01:54:55.501 line:82%
Okay congratulations, supergirl...

1316
01:54:56.083 --> 01:54:58.042 line:82%
...you made me famous before I died.

1317
01:54:58.501 --> 01:54:59.792 line:82%
But soldier...

1318
01:55:01.125 --> 01:55:03.959 line:82%
...there's a small... problem.

1319
01:55:05.250 --> 01:55:07.083 line:82%
What problem can you have?

1320
01:55:07.375 --> 01:55:10.834 line:82%
The problem is that
this story, this contract...

1321
01:55:11.334 --> 01:55:16.751 line:82%
...all this, will happen
only if you come to London.

1322
01:55:19.501 --> 01:55:22.292 line:82%
This is my first story
and I'm a new...

1323
01:55:22.876 --> 01:55:26.292 line:82%
...so it's their system
it can't be changed.

1324
01:55:27.375 --> 01:55:28.959 line:82%
It's only for one day, soldier...

1325
01:55:29.375 --> 01:55:31.584 line:82%
...in twenty- four hours you'll
be back in India, I promise.

1326
01:55:36.417 --> 01:55:38.209 line:82%
I know it's not easy for you...

1327
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:40.209 line:82%
...but my life is at stake here...

1328
01:55:40.626 --> 01:55:43.584 line:82%
...my career will get at
least a 5 year kick start...

1329
01:55:44.584 --> 01:55:47.042 line:82%
...please soldier, for me!

1330
01:55:50.626 --> 01:55:51.876 line:82%
I can't come!

1331
01:55:53.876 --> 01:55:55.042 line:82%
Sorry Akira!

1332
01:55:56.167 --> 01:55:57.083 line:82%
It's okay.

1333
01:56:07.834 --> 01:56:09.375 line:82%
What an arcehole!

1334
01:56:10.209 --> 01:56:11.542 line:82%
He's not an arcehole, John.

1335
01:56:11.834 --> 01:56:13.250 line:82%
So what's his problem then?

1336
01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:19.125 line:82%
He's just... messed up,
it's a long story.

1337
01:56:19.876 --> 01:56:20.959 line:82%
Are you heading back?

1338
01:56:21.959 --> 01:56:23.792 line:82%
Ya, I mean...

1339
01:56:23.959 --> 01:56:26.292 line:82%
...it's been a week since Catherine's
been trying to convince the bosses...

1340
01:56:26.334 --> 01:56:28.083 line:82%
...but... it's not working...

1341
01:56:28.626 --> 01:56:31.042 line:82%
...so I guess I'm back to
Delhi's belly.

1342
01:56:31.834 --> 01:56:33.250 line:82%
What an arcehole!

1343
01:56:38.876 --> 01:56:39.709 line:82%
Hello?

1344
01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:42.083 line:82%
How many offices do these
Discovery Channel guys have?

1345
01:56:42.167 --> 01:56:44.292 line:82%
I am standing at a cross road,
I can't understand where to go.

1346
01:56:44.959 --> 01:56:45.876 line:82%
Where are you?

1347
01:56:45.959 --> 01:56:47.792 line:82%
I am standing somewhere near
the Discovery Channel office...

1348
01:56:47.876 --> 01:56:49.167 line:82%
...all the buildings look the same.

1349
01:56:49.501 --> 01:56:51.751 line:82%
You, you wait right there,
I'm coming.

1350
01:56:52.417 --> 01:56:54.334 line:82%
He... is... here!

1351
01:56:54.417 --> 01:56:56.125 line:82%
I told you he is not an arcehole.

1352
01:57:28.959 --> 01:57:30.167 line:82%
Sorry.

1353
01:57:36.542 --> 01:57:37.709 line:82%
Thank you soldier, thank you.

1354
01:57:38.083 --> 01:57:39.709 line:82%
Thank you soldier...

1355
01:57:42.334 --> 01:57:45.209 line:82%
...it's a big deal that you've
come to London, I know this...

1356
01:57:46.167 --> 01:57:50.167 line:82%
...but that you've come here for me
is the biggest thing in my life.

1357
01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:52.918 line:82%
Don't get sentimental,
I haven't come for you.

1358
01:57:52.959 --> 01:57:54.959 line:82%
I've come to set you here,
permanently...

1359
01:57:55.334 --> 01:57:57.709 line:82%
...so that I'm free from you
for forever.

1360
01:57:57.792 --> 01:58:00.250 line:82%
No chance, soldier...

1361
01:58:00.501 --> 01:58:03.501 line:82%
...so far this story has been one
- sided...

1362
01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:06.751 line:82%
...now it looks like there's
going to be a twist in the story.

1363
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.042 line:82%
Akira!!

1364
01:58:23.292 --> 01:58:24.501 line:82%
Move, move.

1365
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:29.459 line:82%
Samar, Samar, can you hear me.

1366
01:58:29.751 --> 01:58:31.584 line:82%
Samar... are you a doctor?

1367
01:58:32.542 --> 01:58:33.918 line:82%
Can someone please call a doctor?

1368
01:58:34.042 --> 01:58:35.501 line:82%
Can someone please call
an ambulance?

1369
01:58:35.584 --> 01:58:37.584 line:82%
Samar, Samar, Samar...

1370
01:58:39.125 --> 01:58:40.250 line:82%
...what do I do?

1371
01:58:41.334 --> 01:58:42.459 line:82%
Samar!

1372
01:59:07.125 --> 01:59:09.792 line:82%
Excuse me, sorry he's
asking for you.

1373
01:59:28.209 --> 01:59:29.459 line:82%
Where's Meera?

1374
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:36.834 line:82%
It's okay, Samar.

1375
01:59:40.459 --> 01:59:42.501 line:82%
Can you call Meera please...

1376
01:59:45.083 --> 01:59:47.626 line:82%
...the other nurse said she
is waiting outside for me...

1377
01:59:47.709 --> 01:59:50.959 line:82%
Will you call her...
will you call her please.

1378
01:59:52.209 --> 01:59:54.792 line:82%
Nurse... will you please call Meera?

1379
01:59:54.876 --> 01:59:57.542 line:82%
You said she is waiting for me...
I... I need to see her now...

1380
01:59:57.959 --> 01:59:59.125 line:82%
Why aren't you going to him?

1381
01:59:59.459 --> 02:00:00.459 line:82%
I need to see her.

1382
02:00:00.792 --> 02:00:01.959 line:82%
I'm not Meera!

1383
02:00:03.334 --> 02:00:04.417 line:82%
What's wrong!

1384
02:00:04.501 --> 02:00:05.709 line:82%
Why aren't you calling Meera?

1385
02:00:05.792 --> 02:00:06.918 line:82%
Go get Dr. Khan.

1386
02:00:07.834 --> 02:00:08.751 line:82%
Is she okay?

1387
02:00:09.125 --> 02:00:10.459 line:82%
Has something happened to her?

1388
02:00:10.918 --> 02:00:12.375 line:82%
Why aren't you saying something?

1389
02:00:12.459 --> 02:00:13.709 line:82%
Please, I...

1390
02:00:14.959 --> 02:00:16.584 line:82%
Call Meera please.

1391
02:00:16.667 --> 02:00:18.584 line:82%
I need to see Meera.

1392
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:52.125 line:82%
Good morning, Samar!

1393
02:00:52.834 --> 02:00:54.584 line:82%
I'm Dr. Zoya Ali Khan.

1394
02:00:55.083 --> 02:00:58.626 line:82%
Last night I operated on you,
how are you feeling now?

1395
02:00:58.876 --> 02:00:59.834 line:82%
Hmm.

1396
02:01:00.918 --> 02:01:03.209 line:82%
Ok. Full name?

1397
02:01:04.125 --> 02:01:05.334 line:82%
Samar Anand.

1398
02:01:05.584 --> 02:01:06.751 line:82%
Age?

1399
02:01:06.959 --> 02:01:08.334 line:82%
28 years.

1400
02:01:12.292 --> 02:01:14.375 line:82%
What year are we in, Samar?

1401
02:01:16.167 --> 02:01:17.375 line:82%
2002.

1402
02:01:24.209 --> 02:01:26.626 line:82%
Has Samar been in an accident or...

1403
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:28.167 line:82%
...gone through serious
trauma before this?

1404
02:01:30.334 --> 02:01:34.709 line:82%
10 years ago there was an accident...
here in London...

1405
02:01:35.334 --> 02:01:38.501 line:82%
...after that he's come back
to London for the first time.

1406
02:01:39.542 --> 02:01:40.834 line:82%
That explains it.

1407
02:01:42.584 --> 02:01:45.375 line:82%
Samar is suffering from
retrograde amnesia...

1408
02:01:45.876 --> 02:01:48.042 line:82%
...he has regressed ten years...

1409
02:01:48.667 --> 02:01:52.125 line:82%
...his memory, is stuck
in the year 2002...

1410
02:01:54.751 --> 02:01:56.501 line:82%
...the trauma of this accident has...

1411
02:01:56.584 --> 02:01:59.751 line:82%
...regressed his memory
to the previous accident...

1412
02:02:00.334 --> 02:02:02.918 line:82%
...he remembers everything up
until the previous accident...

1413
02:02:03.250 --> 02:02:05.751 line:82%
...but after that he remembers
nothing.

1414
02:02:08.083 --> 02:02:10.626 line:82%
But he'll... become okay, won't he?

1415
02:02:12.792 --> 02:02:14.751 line:82%
In cases like these,
it's impossible to say...

1416
02:02:15.542 --> 02:02:19.834 line:82%
...some patients get their memory
back in a day and for some...

1417
02:02:19.918 --> 02:02:21.083 line:82%
...never!

1418
02:02:25.751 --> 02:02:27.751 line:82%
So... now?

1419
02:02:28.334 --> 02:02:31.751 line:82%
Firstly we will have to
bring in the people he knew...

1420
02:02:32.417 --> 02:02:35.167 line:82%
...when he is with the people
he trusts...

1421
02:02:35.459 --> 02:02:38.334 line:82%
...his shock and trauma
will both lessen...

1422
02:02:39.083 --> 02:02:41.083 line:82%
...and then we might be
able to bring him back.

1423
02:02:42.167 --> 02:02:45.501 line:82%
These are some names, addresses
and numbers, Samar has given.

1424
02:02:45.751 --> 02:02:47.667 line:82%
I don't know if these
are still valid...

1425
02:02:48.626 --> 02:02:50.959 line:82%
...but if you find as many as
possible, it will help...

1426
02:02:51.375 --> 02:02:54.417 line:82%
...and yes, the most
important is this girl.

1427
02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:55.751 line:82%
Meera!

1428
02:02:55.959 --> 02:02:58.167 line:82%
Samar's been asking
for her, since yesterday.

1429
02:03:07.792 --> 02:03:09.042 line:82%
Aye soldier...

1430
02:03:09.876 --> 02:03:12.876 line:82%
...why so much drama,
just to forget me?

1431
02:03:17.542 --> 02:03:18.709 line:82%
But now you listen...

1432
02:03:19.626 --> 02:03:21.125 line:82%
...do what you want.

1433
02:03:22.042 --> 02:03:24.083 line:82%
Akira won't let you forget her.

1434
02:04:34.751 --> 02:04:37.083 line:82%
Honey, honey look into the camera.

1435
02:04:39.167 --> 02:04:40.751 line:82%
You look beautiful.

1436
02:04:42.459 --> 02:04:43.918 line:82%
Hi daddy.

1437
02:04:43.959 --> 02:04:45.083 line:82%
Hi...

1438
02:04:46.209 --> 02:04:49.584 line:82%
Happy birthday to you.

1439
02:04:49.876 --> 02:04:54.292 line:82%
Happy birthday to you.

1440
02:04:54.626 --> 02:04:59.042 line:82%
Happy birthday to you.

1441
02:05:00.334 --> 02:05:04.542 line:82%
Happy birthday to you.

1442
02:05:28.125 --> 02:05:29.250 line:82%
Meera!

1443
02:05:29.751 --> 02:05:30.876 line:82%
Yes!

1444
02:05:30.959 --> 02:05:33.417 line:82%
I need to talk to you...

1445
02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:37.125 line:82%
I'm sorry I... can't seem
to place you.

1446
02:05:37.209 --> 02:05:39.959 line:82%
No... ya... um we've never met...

1447
02:05:40.792 --> 02:05:43.042 line:82%
I'm Akira...
I just need a few minutes.

1448
02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:45.459 line:82%
You know I'm extremely late
for a meeting.

1449
02:05:45.542 --> 02:05:46.751 line:82%
I'm really sorry...

1450
02:05:46.834 --> 02:05:48.792 line:82%
...but would you mind making an
appointment with my assistant.

1451
02:05:48.876 --> 02:05:50.417 line:82%
I'm really sorry!

1452
02:05:52.501 --> 02:05:53.667 line:82%
It's about Samar!

1453
02:06:07.959 --> 02:06:10.083 line:82%
I know how difficult
this is for you...

1454
02:06:12.250 --> 02:06:15.042 line:82%
...you have a family... a husband...

1455
02:06:15.125 --> 02:06:16.209 line:82%
a daughter...

1456
02:06:17.501 --> 02:06:19.876 line:82%
...but beside you, there's no
one else who can do this.

1457
02:06:21.918 --> 02:06:23.792 line:82%
Samar keeps asking for you...

1458
02:06:25.334 --> 02:06:27.083 line:82%
...he only wants to see you.

1459
02:06:29.584 --> 02:06:31.959 line:82%
The doctor feels if he
see's you just once you...

1460
02:06:32.375 --> 02:06:36.375 line:82%
...meets you, he might be
able to hear the truth...

1461
02:06:38.334 --> 02:06:39.751 line:82%
...just come once, Meera...

1462
02:06:41.042 --> 02:06:42.167 line:82%
...please...

1463
02:06:43.375 --> 02:06:44.459 line:82%
...for Samar.

1464
02:06:51.834 --> 02:06:54.667 line:82%
Meera, you'll have to handle
Samar very carefully...

1465
02:06:55.125 --> 02:06:57.542 line:82%
...his mental state is very delicate...

1466
02:06:57.959 --> 02:07:03.459 line:82%
...any kind of shock or bad news
could permanently damage his system...

1467
02:07:04.042 --> 02:07:06.250 line:82%
...and then bringing him
back may be impossible...

1468
02:07:07.584 --> 02:07:09.834 line:82%
...and Meera, just remember...

1469
02:07:10.751 --> 02:07:15.542 line:82%
...you are the bridge that
joins Samar to the outside world.

1470
02:07:18.375 --> 02:07:19.542 line:82%
Are you ready?

1471
02:07:19.792 --> 02:07:20.918 line:82%
Shall we do this?

1472
02:07:24.209 --> 02:07:25.292 line:82%
Great!

1473
02:07:25.876 --> 02:07:27.751 line:82%
I'll just check on him and call you.

1474
02:07:35.083 --> 02:07:36.250 line:82%
Thank you!

1475
02:07:52.542 --> 02:07:58.459 line:82%
Seeing you makes me feel.

1476
02:07:58.667 --> 02:08:05.042 line:82%
A departed dream returns to me.

1477
02:08:07.751 --> 02:08:13.959 line:82%
Passing through that
century-long night.

1478
02:08:14.042 --> 02:08:19.918 line:82%
A burst of morning returns to me.

1479
02:08:19.959 --> 02:08:31.709 line:82%
Keeping awake, crossing miles.

1480
02:08:32.042 --> 02:08:37.626 line:82%
The dream held me by the hand.

1481
02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:44.167 line:82%
Breath held for many years.

1482
02:08:44.250 --> 02:08:50.501 line:82%
I can breathe again.

1483
02:08:50.584 --> 02:08:55.417 line:82%
I can breathe again.

1484
02:08:56.125 --> 02:09:02.375 line:82%
As my breath mingles with yours.

1485
02:09:02.459 --> 02:09:08.584 line:82%
I can breathe again.

1486
02:09:08.667 --> 02:09:15.417 line:82%
I can breathe again.

1487
02:09:34.626 --> 02:09:37.834 line:82%
Samar, what's the last thing
you remember before the accident?

1488
02:09:41.167 --> 02:09:42.292 line:82%
Meera...

1489
02:09:44.417 --> 02:09:46.667 line:82%
Meera is dressed in
a sexy pink dress...

1490
02:09:47.584 --> 02:09:48.751 line:82%
...her hair is open...

1491
02:09:49.125 --> 02:09:52.334 line:82%
...she's smiling... watching
me do stunts on my bike...

1492
02:09:54.042 --> 02:09:56.959 line:82%
...and then suddenly a car
slams into me and then...

1493
02:09:57.876 --> 02:09:58.959 line:82%
Black!

1494
02:09:59.334 --> 02:10:00.501 line:82%
Full black!

1495
02:10:05.417 --> 02:10:10.959 line:82%
Samar, the accident you are talking
about happened ten years ago...

1496
02:10:11.876 --> 02:10:15.375 line:82%
...and we're not in 2002,
we are in the year 2012.

1497
02:10:18.042 --> 02:10:19.125 line:82%
What!

1498
02:10:22.209 --> 02:10:24.417 line:82%
Meera... this?

1499
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:25.834 line:82%
Samar!

1500
02:10:26.876 --> 02:10:28.083 line:82%
Just listen to her.

1501
02:10:28.167 --> 02:10:29.417 line:82%
Let me explain.

1502
02:10:29.667 --> 02:10:33.250 line:82%
Samar because of the head
injury you have amnesia.

1503
02:10:33.876 --> 02:10:35.167 line:82%
Retrograde amnesia...

1504
02:10:35.709 --> 02:10:37.918 line:82%
...and it is very common
with head injuries...

1505
02:10:38.542 --> 02:10:40.042 line:82%
...so please don't worry...

1506
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:43.125 line:82%
...with time you will
remember everything...

1507
02:10:43.417 --> 02:10:45.083 line:82%
...and you will become
absolutely okay.

1508
02:10:46.459 --> 02:10:49.834 line:82%
I know you have a lot of questions
that you want answers for.

1509
02:10:51.042 --> 02:10:52.501 line:82%
Meera is with you...

1510
02:10:52.584 --> 02:10:57.167 line:82%
...and whenever you need me
I'm right outside, okay?

1511
02:11:00.792 --> 02:11:01.876 line:82%
I'll see you.

1512
02:11:11.626 --> 02:11:13.542 line:82%
I don't understand, Meera...

1513
02:11:15.334 --> 02:11:16.542 line:82%
10 years...

1514
02:11:18.918 --> 02:11:19.959 line:82%
10 years!!

1515
02:11:21.584 --> 02:11:22.959 line:82%
Samar It's ok...

1516
02:11:23.959 --> 02:11:25.167 line:82%
...its ok...

1517
02:11:28.083 --> 02:11:30.167 line:82%
We've been together for 10 years?

1518
02:11:38.626 --> 02:11:40.375 line:82%
How long have we been married?

1519
02:11:46.667 --> 02:11:47.792 line:82%
Five years.

1520
02:11:53.375 --> 02:11:54.918 line:82%
I want to remember everything...

1521
02:11:56.792 --> 02:11:58.501 line:82%
...everyday, every second
I've spent with you.

1522
02:11:58.584 --> 02:12:00.167 line:82%
I want to remember everything.

1523
02:12:01.501 --> 02:12:04.167 line:82%
I... I want to remember everything.

1524
02:12:15.792 --> 02:12:18.792 line:82%
No, ya Meera, no more...

1525
02:12:19.834 --> 02:12:21.584 line:82%
...you've already done
so much and...

1526
02:12:21.667 --> 02:12:23.459 line:82%
...to ask you for more
of your time...

1527
02:12:23.542 --> 02:12:24.876 line:82%
...to do all this drama.

1528
02:12:26.125 --> 02:12:27.375 line:82%
I don't feel right...

1529
02:12:28.792 --> 02:12:31.834 line:82%
...you have a family, a husband,
a daughter.

1530
02:12:31.918 --> 02:12:33.083 line:82%
Akira...

1531
02:12:35.876 --> 02:12:37.375 line:82%
I'm not married.

1532
02:12:43.042 --> 02:12:45.250 line:82%
And nor do I have any daughter.

1533
02:12:52.125 --> 02:12:54.417 line:82%
I made a promise to leave Samar...

1534
02:12:56.292 --> 02:12:57.959 line:82%
...not to get married.

1535
02:13:00.751 --> 02:13:04.584 line:82%
Roger is an old friend and
has always remained a friend.

1536
02:13:05.959 --> 02:13:06.959 line:82%
He is divorced so...

1537
02:13:07.083 --> 02:13:09.667 line:82%
...every year I help him
arrange his daughter's birthday.

1538
02:13:12.876 --> 02:13:15.501 line:82%
I can't bear to see Samar
like this...

1539
02:13:17.292 --> 02:13:20.250 line:82%
...and I want to do whatever
I can...

1540
02:13:23.042 --> 02:13:25.834 line:82%
...but before that, it was
necessary for me to tell you this.

1541
02:13:29.375 --> 02:13:31.042 line:82%
I love Samar, Akira...

1542
02:13:33.751 --> 02:13:36.959 line:82%
...always have, always will...

1543
02:13:40.292 --> 02:13:42.292 line:82%
...but I can never be his.

1544
02:13:45.751 --> 02:13:47.501 line:82%
Now after knowing all this...

1545
02:13:47.959 --> 02:13:49.792 line:82%
...what needs to be done...

1546
02:13:51.292 --> 02:13:52.417 line:82%
...is up to you.

1547
02:13:59.876 --> 02:14:01.459 line:82%
Samar was right...

1548
02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:03.501 line:82%
I should have left
his love story as...

1549
02:14:03.584 --> 02:14:05.167 line:82%
...just a story and
forgotten about it.

1550
02:14:06.250 --> 02:14:08.667 line:82%
I was cool... I would've
remained cool...

1551
02:14:09.334 --> 02:14:13.459 line:82%
...but I got trapped in his love
so much, now I can't let it go.

1552
02:14:20.459 --> 02:14:25.667 line:82%
Come... let's get him back
and then beat him up together.

1553
02:14:35.334 --> 02:14:37.334 line:82%
A nice bottle of Chilean Red?

1554
02:14:38.292 --> 02:14:39.709 line:82%
Definitely, ya sure...

1555
02:14:41.375 --> 02:14:42.375 line:82%
Is everything alright sir?

1556
02:14:42.459 --> 02:14:44.626 line:82%
- Yes very well thank you.
- Okay.

1557
02:14:46.417 --> 02:14:48.459 line:82%
- All okay ma'am?
- Hmm Thank you.

1558
02:14:50.209 --> 02:14:52.751 line:82%
Maria, Mrs. Smith has been
waiting for 45 minutes.

1559
02:14:52.834 --> 02:14:54.792 line:82%
If she's has asked for
Maria's special of the day...

1560
02:14:54.876 --> 02:14:56.959 line:82%
...then she will have to
wait for it to be special...

1561
02:14:57.042 --> 02:14:58.334 line:82%
...now leave me alone.

1562
02:14:58.626 --> 02:15:00.667 line:82%
Superb, here's getting
married to a white...

1563
02:15:04.042 --> 02:15:06.584 line:82%
Meera...

1564
02:15:22.626 --> 02:15:28.042 line:82%
Zain, if you can't do
this feel free to say so...

1565
02:15:28.542 --> 02:15:30.959 line:82%
...we realize that we're probably
asking for a bit too much.

1566
02:15:31.083 --> 02:15:32.292 line:82%
Too much?

1567
02:15:32.751 --> 02:15:35.209 line:82%
No, Akira, you're
asking for too little.

1568
02:15:35.751 --> 02:15:39.334 line:82%
This restaurant, my house
all of it is Samar's...

1569
02:15:39.667 --> 02:15:41.834 line:82%
...I started all this with
the money that he gave me...

1570
02:15:42.417 --> 02:15:45.542 line:82%
...otherwise how would this
Lahori have done all this?

1571
02:15:47.417 --> 02:15:50.459 line:82%
He told me that he'd come
one day to take his share...

1572
02:15:51.834 --> 02:15:53.375 line:82%
...but not like this.

1573
02:15:58.375 --> 02:15:59.751 line:82%
You'll don't worry.

1574
02:15:59.959 --> 02:16:03.334 line:82%
Maria and I will shift
into our old Wembley flat.

1575
02:16:03.959 --> 02:16:06.459 line:82%
The restaurant, the house
is all Samar's from now...

1576
02:16:06.918 --> 02:16:09.417 line:82%
...just tell me when are you
bringing him.

1577
02:16:09.501 --> 02:16:10.584 line:82%
Tomorrow.

1578
02:16:11.334 --> 02:16:15.751 line:82%
So as Samar used to say,
done, done, London.

1579
02:16:17.292 --> 02:16:18.459 line:82%
Done, done, London.

1580
02:16:19.375 --> 02:16:20.542 line:82%
Thank you, Zain.

1581
02:16:20.751 --> 02:16:22.209 line:82%
Oh Never mind.

1582
02:16:36.959 --> 02:16:38.667 line:82%
What are you looking at?

1583
02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:40.375 line:82%
London...

1584
02:16:40.834 --> 02:16:44.250 line:82%
...we're growing older but
this city is getting younger.

1585
02:16:47.125 --> 02:16:48.334 line:82%
What were you saying...

1586
02:16:48.584 --> 02:16:50.042 line:82%
...we have our own restaurant?

1587
02:16:50.459 --> 02:16:52.792 line:82%
Yes, sir! Samar's Kitchen...

1588
02:16:52.876 --> 02:16:55.959 line:82%
...it's amongst the top
10 restaurants in London.

1589
02:16:56.417 --> 02:16:58.542 line:82%
I'd never imagined, that
we'd have our own restaurant...

1590
02:16:58.626 --> 02:17:00.083 line:82%
...a bungalow, a car.

1591
02:17:01.209 --> 02:17:03.459 line:82%
Accidently God's
been too kind. I think...

1592
02:17:04.250 --> 02:17:05.834 line:82%
...that's why He's making
things even now.

1593
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:08.751 line:82%
Oye, He is letting you rest
for a while, nothing else.

1594
02:17:09.167 --> 02:17:11.584 line:82%
Don't get too emotional or
we'll meet with another accident.

1595
02:17:12.250 --> 02:17:14.751 line:82%
Everything else I can understand.

1596
02:17:15.292 --> 02:17:16.834 line:82%
One thing I can't understand...

1597
02:17:18.417 --> 02:17:20.125 line:82%
...is how did you hook Maria?

1598
02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:27.042 line:82%
PPK... Pakistani Pathan's charisma.

1599
02:17:27.417 --> 02:17:32.751 line:82%
So now Lahore's famous
because of you.

1600
02:17:40.083 --> 02:17:42.626 line:82%
Here you go, we've come home.

1601
02:18:00.167 --> 02:18:02.626 line:82%
Meera, here, take care
of your prized possession.

1602
02:18:02.918 --> 02:18:05.876 line:82%
I will come with
Maria tomorrow... bye.

1603
02:18:31.584 --> 02:18:33.209 line:82%
Now you've left Sir Jesus...

1604
02:18:33.792 --> 02:18:35.334 line:82%
...and you're making
deals with Shree Krishna.

1605
02:18:35.667 --> 02:18:37.083 line:82%
So what should I do...

1606
02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:40.209 line:82%
...if you meet with one
accident after another?

1607
02:18:40.542 --> 02:18:43.334 line:82%
I'll have to, keep all
the Gods happy.

1608
02:18:46.334 --> 02:18:49.250 line:82%
No more accident's,
I promise okay.

1609
02:18:52.584 --> 02:18:55.334 line:82%
Come, my wife, show me my home.

1610
02:18:56.083 --> 02:18:58.709 line:82%
We live alone in such a big house...

1611
02:18:58.792 --> 02:19:00.167 line:82%
...or is there someone else
on rent here?

1612
02:19:00.751 --> 02:19:01.918 line:82%
Wow

1613
02:19:01.959 --> 02:19:03.209 line:82%
Did we win a lottery?

1614
02:19:31.959 --> 02:19:33.918 line:82%
How is sir Jesus doing?

1615
02:19:34.959 --> 02:19:36.667 line:82%
How are the deals coming along?

1616
02:19:38.417 --> 02:19:40.542 line:82%
I've stopped making deals
and vows...

1617
02:19:42.125 --> 02:19:44.042 line:82%
...now I don't ask for
anything of anybody.

1618
02:19:44.125 --> 02:19:46.876 line:82%
Wow, how did this happen?

1619
02:19:49.876 --> 02:19:51.167 line:82%
I got you...

1620
02:19:53.083 --> 02:19:55.042 line:82%
...so there is no need to
ask for anything else.

1621
02:20:05.626 --> 02:20:07.042 line:82%
You love me that much?

1622
02:20:16.584 --> 02:20:17.709 line:82%
What?

1623
02:20:19.792 --> 02:20:25.334 line:82%
Doctor Khan has said,
for a couple of days no...

1624
02:20:30.709 --> 02:20:31.918 line:82%
Oh man.

1625
02:20:32.167 --> 02:20:33.542 line:82%
But I've got injured on my head...

1626
02:20:33.918 --> 02:20:36.959 line:82%
...and Dr. Khan is a neurologist,
not a sexologist.

1627
02:20:38.501 --> 02:20:39.959 line:82%
I think she's a lesbian...

1628
02:20:53.626 --> 02:20:54.792 line:82%
Meera.

1629
02:21:09.709 --> 02:21:10.834 line:82%
Meera!

1630
02:21:13.459 --> 02:21:14.584 line:82%
Come here.

1631
02:21:30.125 --> 02:21:34.250 line:82%
Have you become more
beautiful than before?

1632
02:21:41.751 --> 02:21:46.626 line:82%
Why does it feel like I am
meeting you after so many years?

1633
02:21:48.250 --> 02:21:49.959 line:82%
Touching you after so many years.

1634
02:21:54.834 --> 02:21:57.834 line:82%
No, no, no, stay here...

1635
02:21:59.667 --> 02:22:01.292 line:82%
...just stay here.

1636
02:22:05.167 --> 02:22:07.959 line:82%
Dr. Khan's allowed
this much, hasn't she?

1637
02:23:09.125 --> 02:23:12.876 line:82%
I can breathe again.

1638
02:23:13.626 --> 02:23:19.250 line:82%
I can breathe again.

1639
02:23:26.334 --> 02:23:32.334 line:82%
I can breathe again.

1640
02:23:37.751 --> 02:23:38.918 line:82%
Dr. Khan...

1641
02:23:39.209 --> 02:23:42.292 line:82%
Dr. Khan has become Changez Khan...

1642
02:23:42.501 --> 02:23:43.918 line:82%
...give me her telephone number...

1643
02:23:44.209 --> 02:23:46.709 line:82%
...being a woman, she doesn't
have the heart of a mother.

1644
02:23:58.667 --> 02:24:00.125 line:82%
I can't do this anymore.

1645
02:24:02.792 --> 02:24:04.125 line:82%
I can't do this anymore.

1646
02:24:08.209 --> 02:24:09.334 line:82%
Please, Meera...

1647
02:24:10.042 --> 02:24:11.792 line:82%
...just a few more days.

1648
02:24:12.792 --> 02:24:15.501 line:82%
Dr. Khan is saying that
Samar is recovering very well...

1649
02:24:16.334 --> 02:24:18.501 line:82%
...his mental condition
is very stable...

1650
02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:22.167 line:82%
...and that very soon something
may trigger his memory.

1651
02:24:22.417 --> 02:24:24.083 line:82%
I can't go on, Akira...

1652
02:24:28.250 --> 02:24:29.709 line:82%
...doctor, please you.

1653
02:24:31.417 --> 02:24:32.667 line:82%
I understand...

1654
02:24:33.375 --> 02:24:34.501 line:82%
I do.

1655
02:24:38.667 --> 02:24:42.209 line:82%
Ideally I wanted to take
this step after two weeks...

1656
02:24:42.834 --> 02:24:44.501 line:82%
...but maybe this is the
right time...

1657
02:24:45.667 --> 02:24:48.417 line:82%
Akira, you will meet Samar...

1658
02:24:49.042 --> 02:24:52.709 line:82%
...maybe seeing you will
trigger his memory immediately.

1659
02:24:53.375 --> 02:24:55.501 line:82%
Yes, this is slightly risky...

1660
02:24:56.083 --> 02:24:58.584 line:82%
...but at this point it
is our best chance.

1661
02:24:59.209 --> 02:25:03.250 line:82%
I think it's time... for Major
Samar Anand... to meet Akira!

1662
02:25:06.959 --> 02:25:08.792 line:82%
Zain, I don't want
to do this interview...

1663
02:25:08.876 --> 02:25:10.042 line:82%
...you're unnecessarily forcing me.

1664
02:25:10.125 --> 02:25:11.959 line:82%
Samar, it's not just any interview.

1665
02:25:12.042 --> 02:25:13.918 line:82%
These are the Discovery Channel guys...

1666
02:25:13.959 --> 02:25:17.417 line:82%
...they're covering the success
story of 10 Indians in London...

1667
02:25:17.667 --> 02:25:21.042 line:82%
...imagine how good marketing
it is for our restaurant.

1668
02:25:21.125 --> 02:25:22.250 line:82%
What marketing!

1669
02:25:22.334 --> 02:25:23.501 line:82%
Instead make me wear a bikini...

1670
02:25:23.584 --> 02:25:24.792 line:82%
...and put its photo
outside the restaurant?

1671
02:25:24.876 --> 02:25:26.334 line:82%
Hey, that is also a good idea.

1672
02:25:26.375 --> 02:25:28.626 line:82%
You're excited uh Pathan, PPK.

1673
02:25:28.709 --> 02:25:30.042 line:82%
Hey that's my Bluetooth.

1674
02:25:37.417 --> 02:25:38.667 line:82%
Here, we've come.

1675
02:25:39.334 --> 02:25:40.584 line:82%
Why have you stopped here?

1676
02:25:40.834 --> 02:25:42.125 line:82%
The channel guys want
to start off...

1677
02:25:42.209 --> 02:25:44.125 line:82%
...from the first place
you worked in London.

1678
02:25:44.209 --> 02:25:46.667 line:82%
Now go quickly, their journalist
is waiting at the entrance for you...

1679
02:25:46.751 --> 02:25:49.167 line:82%
...and I have to go to
the restaurant, okay.

1680
02:25:50.292 --> 02:25:51.334 line:82%
Bye.

1681
02:25:51.417 --> 02:25:52.626 line:82%
Bye.

1682
02:25:53.375 --> 02:25:54.834 line:82%
For one who can't remember anything...

1683
02:25:54.918 --> 02:25:56.417 line:82%
...what interview will
she take of his.

1684
02:26:57.083 --> 02:26:58.250 line:82%
Samar Anand!

1685
02:27:01.209 --> 02:27:04.417 line:82%
Hi, I'm Akira Rai, Discovery Channel.

1686
02:27:04.876 --> 02:27:05.959 line:82%
Uhh!

1687
02:27:06.334 --> 02:27:08.125 line:82%
Have... have we met before?

1688
02:27:10.375 --> 02:27:12.209 line:82%
No! I don't think so.

1689
02:27:12.417 --> 02:27:15.083 line:82%
I'm sorry, my memory
is on a long break...

1690
02:27:15.459 --> 02:27:18.334 line:82%
...so these days every
face looks familiar to me.

1691
02:27:18.834 --> 02:27:19.959 line:82%
It's okay, Samar.

1692
02:27:20.167 --> 02:27:22.042 line:82%
I know about your condition...

1693
02:27:22.125 --> 02:27:23.959 line:82%
...don't worry, I won't trouble
you much.

1694
02:27:24.042 --> 02:27:25.334 line:82%
No, no, no, please trouble me...

1695
02:27:25.459 --> 02:27:28.375 line:82%
...maybe that might help
trigger some lost memory.

1696
02:27:30.334 --> 02:27:33.334 line:82%
Okay then, get ready
for the trouble.

1697
02:27:33.375 --> 02:27:34.626 line:82%
Uh make up okay?

1698
02:27:36.834 --> 02:27:37.959 line:82%
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1699
02:27:38.250 --> 02:27:39.334 line:82%
Let's go?

1700
02:27:40.334 --> 02:27:41.459 line:82%
Over here.

1701
02:27:41.542 --> 02:27:43.417 line:82%
I use to clean snow...

1702
02:27:43.501 --> 02:27:47.250 line:82%
...for 4 pounds per hour
for Jack sir...

1703
02:27:48.792 --> 02:27:51.918 line:82%
...this is a very special place
for me, uh Akira... right?

1704
02:27:52.792 --> 02:27:54.751 line:82%
Not because this was my first job...

1705
02:27:55.167 --> 02:27:57.751 line:82%
...but because this is where I
saw Meera for the first time...

1706
02:27:59.334 --> 02:28:00.501 line:82%
...right there.

1707
02:28:01.792 --> 02:28:03.334 line:82%
In the middle of white snow...

1708
02:28:03.751 --> 02:28:06.083 line:82%
...like a fairy dressed in red,
glide across the snow.

1709
02:28:06.542 --> 02:28:08.334 line:82%
It took one second and
I fell flat for her...

1710
02:28:09.417 --> 02:28:11.918 line:82%
...you haven't seen my wife, hmm?

1711
02:28:13.209 --> 02:28:15.334 line:82%
She's the world's
most beautiful woman.

1712
02:28:16.125 --> 02:28:18.834 line:82%
I have no idea how she
fell for a clown like me.

1713
02:28:26.292 --> 02:28:29.542 line:82%
Oh wow, this is my favorite bike.

1714
02:28:30.167 --> 02:28:33.375 line:82%
I had this, I bought it second
- hand from a friend.

1715
02:28:34.709 --> 02:28:36.584 line:82%
may I ride it, please?

1716
02:28:39.334 --> 02:28:40.459 line:82%
Thank You...

1717
02:28:42.709 --> 02:28:43.834 line:82%
...you're also coming?

1718
02:28:44.959 --> 02:28:46.125 line:82%
Come on.

1719
02:29:11.667 --> 02:29:15.250 line:82%
I was a manager in this restaurant,
this whole restaurant.

1720
02:29:17.459 --> 02:29:20.250 line:82%
What does this crazy wanderer seek.

1721
02:29:20.334 --> 02:29:21.834 line:82%
- Samar!
- How are you?

1722
02:29:22.375 --> 02:29:24.918 line:82%
This is Akira, Amit I
found work in Bollywood

1723
02:29:24.959 --> 02:29:26.417 line:82%
- Really!
- Ya No!

1724
02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:31.334 line:82%
Wanders with a smile...

1725
02:29:31.834 --> 02:29:32.751 line:82%
Thank you.

1726
02:29:32.792 --> 02:29:35.834 line:82%
If it wasn't for Frank sir, I would
probably have gone back to Punjab...

1727
02:29:35.918 --> 02:29:39.083 line:82%
...and join the army like
my father and forefathers.

1728
02:29:39.417 --> 02:29:41.459 line:82%
Yet none to call my own.

1729
02:29:41.542 --> 02:29:45.959 line:82%
I never told my mother but
bombs and guns really scare me.

1730
02:29:46.292 --> 02:29:47.959 line:82%
Frank Sir, he saved me...

1731
02:29:48.584 --> 02:29:49.918 line:82%
...thank you, Frank sir.

1732
02:29:50.542 --> 02:29:52.334 line:82%
Samar was my favorite...

1733
02:29:53.042 --> 02:29:55.167 line:82%
- ...he could charm anyone.
- This is for you.

1734
02:29:56.209 --> 02:29:57.834 line:82%

Where is my home?

1747
02:30:40.959 --> 02:30:44.042 line:82%
He asks every passer-by.

1748
02:30:44.334 --> 02:30:46.334 line:82%
Wanders with a smile...

1749
02:30:46.375 --> 02:30:48.334 line:82%
...and a tear.

1750
02:30:48.417 --> 02:30:51.792 line:82%
Wanders aimless from street to street.

1751
02:30:52.667 --> 02:30:54.250 line:82%
Belonging to all.

1752
02:30:54.334 --> 02:30:56.125 line:82%
I wrote this song for Meera...

1753
02:30:56.459 --> 02:30:57.584 line:82%
...and see my fate...

1754
02:30:57.792 --> 02:30:58.959 line:82%
...it was an evening just like this.

1755
02:30:59.042 --> 02:31:01.167 line:82%
I was singing... and
when I opened my eyes.

1756
02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:02.792 line:82%
Meera was standing in front of me...

1757
02:31:03.667 --> 02:31:05.584 line:82%
...for who my heart sung this song...

1758
02:31:06.209 --> 02:31:07.584 line:82%
...it reached out and found her heart.

1759
02:31:07.792 --> 02:31:09.959 line:82%

02:31:33.959 --> 02:31:44.042 line:82%
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1768
02:32:06.918 --> 02:32:09.167 line:82%
Today I met Samar Anand...

1769
02:32:10.375 --> 02:32:13.083 line:82%
...a man who I had
never met before...

1770
02:32:14.751 --> 02:32:17.250 line:82%
...the Samar that I know
is like... a ghost...

1771
02:32:17.375 --> 02:32:18.417 line:82%
...a shadow...

1772
02:32:18.751 --> 02:32:20.125 line:82%
...that's not alive.

1773
02:32:22.584 --> 02:32:24.834 line:82%
Samar lives only to love you...

1774
02:32:26.167 --> 02:32:28.959 line:82%
...without you there's
no breath in his life.

1775
02:32:33.334 --> 02:32:34.542 line:82%
You know!

1776
02:32:34.959 --> 02:32:36.626 line:82%
I was thinking the whole day...

1777
02:32:36.709 --> 02:32:38.959 line:82%
...that if we were in his
life together the same time...

1778
02:32:39.083 --> 02:32:40.250 line:82%
...what would happen...

1779
02:32:40.751 --> 02:32:43.959 line:82%
...and even in my dreams,
I was miles behind you.

1780
02:32:47.125 --> 02:32:48.626 line:82%
You don't know me.

1781
02:32:49.250 --> 02:32:52.083 line:82%
I've been a topper all my life...

1782
02:32:53.626 --> 02:32:55.834 line:82%
...an honor student, a gold
medalist in every sport.

1783
02:32:57.250 --> 02:32:59.250 line:82%
I dump my boyfriends
every three months...

1784
02:32:59.334 --> 02:33:01.125 line:82%
...before they leave me...

1785
02:33:02.792 --> 02:33:04.626 line:82%
...because I can't handle rejection.

1786
02:33:07.834 --> 02:33:12.334 line:82%
So now before Samar recovers and
lectures me on friendship and all.

1787
02:33:12.959 --> 02:33:14.918 line:82%
I am getting out of this love...

1788
02:33:16.125 --> 02:33:19.584 line:82%
...it'll take time but then
I'll be okay.

1789
02:33:22.459 --> 02:33:25.292 line:82%
So I've come to tell you that...

1790
02:33:25.918 --> 02:33:28.375 line:82%
...if it's because of me that
you're stopping yourself...

1791
02:33:28.918 --> 02:33:30.292 line:82%
...then you're wasting time...

1792
02:33:31.792 --> 02:33:34.292 line:82%
...because I've never existed
in Samar's love story.

1793
02:33:35.876 --> 02:33:40.292 line:82%
His love story's always had Meera
and will only have Meera in it.

1794
02:33:45.626 --> 02:33:48.375 line:82%
I wasn't stopping myself
because of you, Akira...

1795
02:33:49.584 --> 02:33:51.459 line:82%
...it is because of
Samar I'm stopping myself.

1796
02:33:53.501 --> 02:33:57.417 line:82%
Everyday I want to break my
promise and fall into his arms...

1797
02:33:59.042 --> 02:34:01.584 line:82%
...but what if something
happens to him?

1798
02:34:03.417 --> 02:34:06.209 line:82%
It is this if that scares
me and why I stop myself...

1799
02:34:09.542 --> 02:34:12.375 line:82%
...every day I pray for his life...

1800
02:34:14.334 --> 02:34:16.501 line:82%
...and every day I die a little.

1801
02:34:20.334 --> 02:34:23.626 line:82%
Now this... God, prayers,
promises and all.

1802
02:34:23.959 --> 02:34:25.751 line:82%
I don't understand...

1803
02:34:26.334 --> 02:34:28.167 line:82%
I really don't pray much...

1804
02:34:29.751 --> 02:34:32.292 line:82%
...but before going there's
one tip I'm giving you.

1805
02:34:34.542 --> 02:34:37.626 line:82%
You left him so that
he stays alive...

1806
02:34:38.959 --> 02:34:42.876 line:82%
...but now if you're not with
him he is as good as dead...

1807
02:34:44.250 --> 02:34:46.459 line:82%
...maybe your God's trying
to tell you.

1808
02:34:46.751 --> 02:34:49.292 line:82%
Hey Meera, enough is enough...

1809
02:34:50.042 --> 02:34:53.083 line:82%
...now go and live a little.

1810
02:34:58.083 --> 02:34:59.334 line:82%
See you.

1811
02:35:19.125 --> 02:35:20.292 line:82%
Ya, Zain.

1812
02:35:20.334 --> 02:35:21.834 line:82%

02:35:23.834 --> 02:35:26.584 line:82%

02:35:26.876 --> 02:35:28.292 line:82%

1818
02:35:39.834 --> 02:35:42.876 line:82%
Everybody up this way - Due to a
reported bomb aboard the train...

1819
02:35:43.125 --> 02:35:46.250 line:82%
...all passengers are requested

1820
02:35:46.334 --> 02:35:48.250 line:82%
...by the nearest available exit...

02:35:48.334 --> 02:35:51.584 line:82%
...please obey the instructions
by the security personnel.

1822
02:36:12.834 --> 02:36:17.626 line:82%
Due to a reported bomb...
bomb... bomb.

1823
02:36:33.959 --> 02:36:35.334 line:82%
Three minutes copy.

1824
02:36:35.792 --> 02:36:36.959 line:82%
Mister you can't be here...

1825
02:36:37.042 --> 02:36:39.459 line:82%
...there's a bomb on board

1834
02:38:12.209 --> 02:38:14.876 line:82%

1842
02:39:31.042 --> 02:39:34.334 line:82%
...why have you called me here?

1843
02:39:51.834 --> 02:39:53.959 line:82%

I have lost in the past...

1844
02:39:54.834 --> 02:39:57.292 line:82%

steal back one moment...

1845
02:39:58.334 --> 02:40:02.709 line:82%

once again, marry you.

1846
02:40:10.584 --> 02:40:12.375 line:82%
Will you marry me, Meera?

1847
02:40:14.834 --> 02:40:17.501 line:82%
Stop it, Samar, we can't
just get married like this.

1848
02:40:17.584 --> 02:40:19.834 line:82%
Why, why can't we?

1849
02:40:20.459 --> 02:40:22.083 line:82%
You'd said this is
how we got married.

1850
02:40:22.167 --> 02:40:24.918 line:82%
No celebrations, just you and me...

1851
02:40:25.459 --> 02:40:28.167 line:82%
...so let's just do it again...
for me...

1852
02:40:28.918 --> 02:40:31.542 line:82%
...come on, I'll start.

1853
02:40:32.417 --> 02:40:35.959 line:82%
I'm sorry, what I
said last time or how.

1854
02:40:36.042 --> 02:40:37.334 line:82%
I don't remember...

1855
02:40:37.918 --> 02:40:40.918 line:82%
...but all I will say this time
is that I love Meera a lot...

1856
02:40:42.125 --> 02:40:44.584 line:82%
...and I promise that
I will forever.

1857
02:40:44.667 --> 02:40:46.042 line:82%
Stop it, Samar.

1858
02:40:47.334 --> 02:40:48.876 line:82%
This is not a joke!

1859
02:40:51.167 --> 02:40:52.501 line:82%
Wow, this is amazing...

1860
02:40:53.542 --> 02:40:55.834 line:82%
...you've made our marriage
a joke and lied about it...

1861
02:40:57.709 --> 02:41:00.250 line:82%
...and I can't even play
a small little prank?

1862
02:41:13.292 --> 02:41:15.250 line:82%
Memory is such a funny thing...

1863
02:41:16.375 --> 02:41:19.125 line:82%
...we spend a whole lifetime
trying to forget something...

1864
02:41:19.459 --> 02:41:20.626 line:82%
...but we can't...

1865
02:41:21.083 --> 02:41:23.292 line:82%
...and then if try to
remember something small...

1866
02:41:23.334 --> 02:41:24.834 line:82%
...we're unable to...

1867
02:41:25.876 --> 02:41:27.042 line:82%
...you know, Meera...

1868
02:41:27.334 --> 02:41:29.250 line:82%
...every day in the army
I used to think...

1869
02:41:29.667 --> 02:41:31.542 line:82%
...why is it that He keeps me alive?

1870
02:41:32.334 --> 02:41:34.042 line:82%
Today I figured that out.

1871
02:41:34.876 --> 02:41:37.459 line:82%
He wasn't fully satisfied
with what He had done to me.

1872
02:41:38.459 --> 02:41:40.626 line:82%
He first tears me away from your life.

1873
02:41:40.959 --> 02:41:43.709 line:82%
He says go... go live without her.

1874
02:41:44.167 --> 02:41:45.792 line:82%
So I go and every day.

1875
02:41:45.876 --> 02:41:49.125 line:82%
I live in the arms of
Death hoping to defeat God.

1876
02:41:49.959 --> 02:41:52.167 line:82%
But out there also
He kept winning.

1877
02:41:52.501 --> 02:41:54.501 line:82%
He didn't let me die...

1878
02:41:56.250 --> 02:41:59.709 line:82%
...and then one day, like magic,
He brings you back into my life.

1879
02:42:00.083 --> 02:42:01.751 line:82%
He brings back all my lost memories.

1880
02:42:01.834 --> 02:42:03.042 line:82%
He makes me fly again...

1881
02:42:03.125 --> 02:42:06.834 line:82%
...and then in a flash he
slams me back onto the ground.

1882
02:42:09.417 --> 02:42:11.959 line:82%
He wakes me up from
my dreams and tells me...

1883
02:42:14.959 --> 02:42:16.584 line:82%
...your life is exactly how it is.

1884
02:42:17.751 --> 02:42:21.209 line:82%
Meera is still Mine,
she will never be yours...

1885
02:42:22.125 --> 02:42:23.959 line:82%
...because even till today...

1886
02:42:24.584 --> 02:42:25.792 line:82%
...the promise she made to Me...

1887
02:42:25.876 --> 02:42:27.959 line:82%
...is greater than the
promise she made to you...

1888
02:42:28.959 --> 02:42:31.375 line:82%
...there's this simple little
thing you don't seem to understand...

1889
02:42:34.167 --> 02:42:38.459 line:82%
...more than you,
she's in love with Me...

1890
02:42:42.375 --> 02:42:44.959 line:82%
...if you'd at least left
me for another person.

1891
02:42:45.042 --> 02:42:47.375 line:82%
I would've felt pity and
forgiven him...

1892
02:42:48.501 --> 02:42:52.542 line:82%
...but... how do I feel pity God?

1893
02:42:56.501 --> 02:42:57.667 line:82%
I'm going back.

1894
02:43:00.250 --> 02:43:02.375 line:82%
I spent 10 years without you...

1895
02:43:03.125 --> 02:43:05.042 line:82%
...by loving you every single day.

1896
02:43:05.125 --> 02:43:06.459 line:82%
I can live for another 100 years...

1897
02:43:06.542 --> 02:43:11.125 line:82%
...either... either He kills me...

1898
02:43:13.334 --> 02:43:18.334 line:82%
...or then accepts
defeat and sends you to me.

1899
02:43:44.459 --> 02:43:45.709 line:82%
Your passport, ticket...

1900
02:43:45.959 --> 02:43:47.459 line:82%
...immigration form,
I'll fill it for you...

1901
02:43:47.501 --> 02:43:49.083 line:82%
...but the immigration is there.

1902
02:43:49.959 --> 02:43:52.459 line:82%
My memory is back now, remember?

1903
02:43:54.250 --> 02:43:56.417 line:82%
I wish I could delete you
from my memory.

1904
02:43:58.209 --> 02:44:01.125 line:82%
I was such a heartless
carefree bitch...

1905
02:44:02.125 --> 02:44:04.709 line:82%
...and now see what you've made me.

1906
02:44:08.125 --> 02:44:09.584 line:82%
Akira, the thing is.

1907
02:44:10.834 --> 02:44:12.709 line:82%
God and me don't get along to well...

1908
02:44:13.876 --> 02:44:16.834 line:82%
...but while dying I believe He
listens even to His enemies...

1909
02:44:17.209 --> 02:44:18.709 line:82%
...so when my time comes.

1910
02:44:19.584 --> 02:44:21.292 line:82%
I'll ask Him for another life...

1911
02:44:23.626 --> 02:44:25.250 line:82%
...to love you!

1912
02:44:28.083 --> 02:44:31.042 line:82%
This time around I was
born in the wrong generation.

1913
02:44:31.459 --> 02:44:35.292 line:82%
I became a bit old fashioned, no?

1914
02:44:36.709 --> 02:44:38.250 line:82%
But I promise next time.

1915
02:44:39.167 --> 02:44:41.876 line:82%
I'll come as a modern
lover like you...

1916
02:44:42.417 --> 02:44:45.083 line:82%
...and ours will be a full on
English style love story.

1917
02:44:45.334 --> 02:44:46.751 line:82%
Very good soldier...

1918
02:44:47.542 --> 02:44:50.167 line:82%
...you've made me into a complete
romantic and you're turning modern.

1919
02:44:51.250 --> 02:44:52.876 line:82%
If you want to come,
come back exactly like this...

1920
02:44:53.292 --> 02:44:54.792 line:82%
...from head to toe.

1921
02:44:55.626 --> 02:44:58.250 line:82%
Akira will never have a shortage
of boyfriends in any life.

1922
02:45:00.125 --> 02:45:01.501 line:82%
Don't become like me.

1923
02:45:06.334 --> 02:45:08.209 line:82%
Too late soldier.

1924
02:45:09.542 --> 02:45:10.667 line:82%
Too late.

1925
02:45:50.292 --> 02:45:53.334 line:82%
Hold these vehicles till I don't
give you an 'all clear' signal.

1926
02:45:53.959 --> 02:45:56.167 line:82%
Right? Over and out.

1927
02:46:54.334 --> 02:46:56.292 line:82%
- Saved.
- Okay sir.

1928
02:46:56.959 --> 02:46:59.334 line:82%
- Krishnan.
- Yes, sir. - Again.

1929
02:46:59.959 --> 02:47:01.292 line:82%
It's become common.

1930
02:47:01.626 --> 02:47:04.167 line:82%
- Do one thing.
- Okay sir.

1931
02:47:07.792 --> 02:47:08.959 line:82%
Okay sir.

1932
02:47:40.834 --> 02:47:42.959 line:82%
Am I going to die today?

1933
02:47:44.918 --> 02:47:47.542 line:82%
You didn't bear these 10
years all by yourself Samar.

1934
02:47:49.209 --> 02:47:51.751 line:82%
I've been dying
everyday along with you...

1935
02:47:54.959 --> 02:47:57.959 line:82%
...it's taken me 10 years to
understand a simple thing...

1936
02:48:01.375 --> 02:48:03.918 line:82%
...that He didn't keep you
alive to be without me.

1937
02:48:07.584 --> 02:48:09.459 line:82%
He kept you alive to be with me.

1938
02:48:12.709 --> 02:48:15.083 line:82%
Couldn't you have understood
this a little sooner...

1939
02:48:15.918 --> 02:48:17.334 line:82%
...just a little.

1940
02:48:21.834 --> 02:48:23.876 line:82%
You knew this from the beginning...

1941
02:48:24.584 --> 02:48:28.334 line:82%
...that I take a little more
time to understand things...

1942
02:48:30.292 --> 02:48:33.918 line:82%
...and someone had told me...

1943
02:48:35.167 --> 02:48:37.250 line:82%
...that every love has it's time...

1944
02:48:38.959 --> 02:48:40.626 line:82%
...that time was not ours...

1945
02:48:43.667 --> 02:48:45.250 line:82%
...but this, is our time.

1946
02:48:46.709 --> 02:48:49.959 line:82%
Sir we've located another IED.

1947
02:48:54.292 --> 02:48:55.959 line:82%
Wait for a some more time.

1948
02:48:57.334 --> 02:48:59.334 line:82%
I'll finish a bit of
work and come back.

1949
02:49:01.959 --> 02:49:03.167 line:82%
And listen!

1950
02:49:04.083 --> 02:49:05.501 line:82%
Don't pray for anything...

1951
02:49:06.584 --> 02:49:08.375 line:82%
...just love me...

1952
02:49:09.250 --> 02:49:10.876 line:82%
...because there's no bomb...

1953
02:49:11.209 --> 02:49:14.292 line:82%
...or God, that can keep me
from coming back to you.

1954
02:49:15.959 --> 02:49:17.334 line:82%
I know.

1955
02:49:24.083 --> 02:49:27.542 line:82%
Samar Anand, The Man Who Cannot Die!

1956
02:49:28.459 --> 02:49:32.626 line:82%
He has diffused 107 bombs
without a scratch on his body.

1957
02:49:32.959 --> 02:49:36.834 line:82%
He's right now as we
speak diffusing his 108th.

1958
02:49:37.459 --> 02:49:39.626 line:82%
This is not a story of courage...

1959
02:49:40.083 --> 02:49:42.292 line:82%
...it's not a story of... miracles!

1960
02:49:43.250 --> 02:49:46.334 line:82%
It's just a simple story of love...

1961
02:49:47.417 --> 02:49:50.209 line:82%
...undying love that a
man had for a woman...

1962
02:49:50.918 --> 02:49:53.876 line:82%
...unflinching love that
a woman had for a man...

1963
02:49:54.834 --> 02:49:57.918 line:82%
...and unending faith
that god had on their love.

1964
02:49:59.459 --> 02:50:01.292 line:82%
I got into this story thinking...

1965
02:50:01.334 --> 02:50:03.834 line:82%
...that this was my big
ticket to Discovery channel.

1966
02:50:04.334 --> 02:50:06.459 line:82%
I'm going to discover
a story of courage...

1967
02:50:06.792 --> 02:50:09.792 line:82%
...bravery, danger, miracles.

1968
02:50:11.417 --> 02:50:13.250 line:82%
But I ended up discovering love.

1969
02:50:14.167 --> 02:50:15.918 line:82%
Love that breaks you...

1970
02:50:16.334 --> 02:50:17.959 line:82%
...but still keeps you together...

1971
02:50:18.709 --> 02:50:20.459 line:82%
...love that creates distances...

1972
02:50:21.417 --> 02:50:23.250 line:82%
...but still brings you closer...

1973
02:50:24.375 --> 02:50:25.876 line:82%
...love that is true...

1974
02:50:26.542 --> 02:50:27.792 line:82%
...and forever...

1975
02:50:28.167 --> 02:50:29.626 line:82%
...and I learnt that...

1976
02:50:29.876 --> 02:50:32.083 line:82%
...if you have the power
to love like that...

1977
02:50:32.501 --> 02:50:35.334 line:82%
...then god makes sure that
your love finds its way.

1978
02:50:36.292 --> 02:50:39.375 line:82%
All you have to do
is just hang in there...

1979
02:50:40.167 --> 02:50:41.334 line:82%
...and wait...

1980
02:50:41.709 --> 02:50:43.334 line:82%
...wait for your time...

1981
02:50:45.083 --> 02:50:46.667 line:82%
...as we speak right now.

1982
02:50:47.209 --> 02:50:49.876 line:82%
Samar is diffusing his 108th bomb...

1983
02:50:50.751 --> 02:50:52.209 line:82%
...his last one...

1984
02:50:52.918 --> 02:50:55.709 line:82%
...it's his last not because
he's suddenly scared of dying...

1985
02:50:56.083 --> 02:50:57.375 line:82%
...it's his last...

1986
02:50:57.667 --> 02:50:59.626 line:82%
...because it's his time
to live now...

1987
02:51:00.417 --> 02:51:03.042 line:82%
...his wait is finally over...

1988
02:51:03.626 --> 02:51:05.626 line:82%
...his time has come...

1989
02:51:06.417 --> 02:51:08.375 line:82%
...his time to love!

1990
02:51:14.459 --> 02:51:16.292 line:82%
Will you marry me?

1991
02:51:17.042 --> 02:51:18.334 line:82%
Yes.

1992
02:51:52.042 --> 02:51:54.042 line:82%
This is not a story of courage!

1993
02:51:54.375 --> 02:51:56.334 line:82%
It's not a story of miracles!

1994
02:51:57.083 --> 02:52:00.375 line:82%
It's just a simple story of love!

1995
02:55:46.375 --> 02:55:47.542 line:82%
Action!
