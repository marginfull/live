00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:53.042 line:82%
TOMORROW MAY NEVER COME.

2
00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:06.430 line:82%
New York...

3
00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:10.667 line:82%
...one of the biggest cities
in the world...

4
00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.542 line:82%
Every breath and heartbeat of the city
is filled with speed.

5
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.417 line:82%
People are always in a hurry here.

6
00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:29.292 line:82%
They are in a hurry to leave home,
in a hurry to get to the office,

7
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.130 line:82%
always in a hurry to be
a step ahead of life.

8
00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:35.500 line:82%
There is no place for anyone
who can't cope here.

9
00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:42.833 line:82%
Miles away from India,
this city is infested with Indians.

10
00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:46.500 line:82%
In fact, they say every fourth face
in New York is an Indian.

11
00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:48.240 line:82%
One more thing...

12
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.595 line:82%
By the way, that's me.

13
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.208 line:82%
This city taught me to be independent,

14
00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:56.958 line:82%
it taught me to fulfill
my responsibilities,

15
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.042 line:82%
taught me to face life,

16
00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:01.458 line:82%
but it couldn't teach me to love.

17
00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:03.667 line:82%
Where was the time?

18
00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.333 line:82%
Whenever I watched the city from afar,

19
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.792 line:82%
I felt my father was closer.

20
00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:14.375 line:82%
Whenever I missed him, I came here.

21
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:23.850 line:82%
I am Naina Catherine Kapur
and this is my story.

22
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.007 line:82%
But try and understand my problem.

23
00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:37.406 line:82%
I must have the loan extension please.

24
00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:41.584 line:82%
I know the resturant is centerly situated.

25
00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:44.833 line:82%
But there's competition around, Mr. Shah.

26
00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:48.792 line:82%
My mother, Jennifer.
After Papa passed away,

27
00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.195 line:82%
the entire responsibility
of the family fell on her.

28
00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:55.020 line:82%
But she never allowed us to ever
feel the burden of her sorrows.

29
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.783 line:82%
- Thank you! I...
- I'm home.

30
00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:02.750 line:82%
Where were you?

31
00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:04.875 line:82%
Central Park.

32
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:06.333 line:82%
Central Park? Why?

33
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.583 line:82%
- To meet someone.
- Who?

34
00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:09.898 line:82%
To meet my boyfriend.

35
00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.163 line:82%
Bills! Bills! Bills!

36
00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:14.788 line:82%
Private and confidential.

37
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.144 line:82%
What is this?
It's Sweetu's mail again.

38
00:04:17.262 --> 00:04:19.682 line:82%
When'll the mailman understand
that we are Kapur with a U.

39
00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:21.458 line:82%
and they are Kapoor with an O?
He always--

40
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.400 line:82%
Were you crying?

41
00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:25.387 line:82%
No, you were crying.

42
00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:26.563 line:82%
No, Mom.

43
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.417 line:82%
Mother and I,
we lied to each other every day.

44
00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:31.625 line:82%
Spinster Girl?

45
00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:35.304 line:82%
Kunwari kudi marriage bureau,
what's this?

46
00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:36.833 line:82%
Why don't you ask your grandmother?

47
00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:39.042 line:82%
It must be some new plan
to find you a groom.

48
00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:42.137 line:82%
But I don't want to get married!
Why doesn't grandmother leave me alone?

49
00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:43.500 line:82%
Why doesn't she just leave?

50
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:45.735 line:82%
Mom! Where's she?

51
00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:47.335 line:82%
It's going to be eight.+

52
00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:50.677 line:82%
Hi Guys, 10 seconds to go.

53
00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:55.368 line:82%
8 seconds to go.

54
00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:59.083 line:82%
4,3,2,1.
Bang!

55
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.475 line:82%
My grandmother, Lajjo.
She had three dreams.

56
00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:05.000 line:82%
One, that New York
becomes a part of Punjab.

57
00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:09.600 line:82%
Two, that I marry a Sardar,
and three, that my mother dies.

58
00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:12.606 line:82%
Saraswatiji, Lata, Asha and Usha

59
00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:14.708 line:82%
have served you
with their music for years.

60
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.917 line:82%
But from today, Kammo,
Vimmo and I, Lajjo--

61
00:05:19.998 --> 00:05:21.194 line:82%
Hello!

63
00:05:22.648 --> 00:05:24.313 line:82%
So without delay further

64
00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:26.917 line:82%
we are going to present you a song.

65
00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:29.875 line:82%
The words are "Pritam come hither."

66
00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:34.333 line:82%
The song is specially requested by
our neighbor, Chaddaji from Queens.

67
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.142 line:82%
That's very kind of you.

68
00:05:37.798 --> 00:05:40.978 line:82%
Kammo... Vimmo...

69
00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:44.159 line:82%
-Go Lajjo...
-Go Lajjo...

70
00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:49.167 line:82%
Pritam, come hither.

71
00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:54.875 line:82%
Pritam, come hither.

72
00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:58.833 line:82%
My sad heart calls out to you.

73
00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:09.542 line:82%
Grandmother? Grandmother, stop it!

74
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.895 line:82%
Oh God! You interrupted our prayers?

75
00:06:12.075 --> 00:06:13.333 line:82%
Insulted the goddess?

76
00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:15.625 line:82%
-Don't you have any shame?
-Don't you have any shame?

77
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.542 line:82%
Singing "Come hither" to Chaddaji?

78
00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.250 line:82%
Who's singing it to Chaddaji?
We are singing "Pritam, come hither."

79
00:06:20.458 --> 00:06:22.583 line:82%
- What is his first name?
- Pritam--

80
00:06:24.632 --> 00:06:26.452 line:82%
- And what is this?
- What?

81
00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:27.635 line:82%
This.

82
00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.708 line:82%
Wow! Pictures from Kunwari Kudi!

83
00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:33.000 line:82%
All three of them are so good-looking.

84
00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:34.875 line:82%
Three? They look like the same guy.

85
00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:36.292 line:82%
No, no. They are different.

86
00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:38.167 line:82%
Now what is that Kunwari Kudi ad?

87
00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:43.083 line:82%
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl,
choose your groom and be free.

88
00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:44.708 line:82%
Choose one, two or three.

89
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.667 line:82%
Grandmother! I am not interested
in marrying anyone, one, two or three.

90
00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.375 line:82%
If you don't marry,
my child, how will you have children?

91
00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:55.958 line:82%
I can have children.
There's no need to marry.

92
00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:03.292 line:82%
My brother Shiv, a handicap.

93
00:07:03.855 --> 00:07:06.500 line:82%
He couldn't play basketball
like the other boys,

94
00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:09.583 line:82%
but he could be quite irritating
like the other boys.

95
00:07:10.687 --> 00:07:12.677 line:82%
Shiv, put off the T.V.

96
00:07:12.758 --> 00:07:14.167 line:82%
Whenever I see,
it's always basketball!

97
00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:16.875 line:82%
Just because I can't play,
doesn't mean I can't see.

98
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.135 line:82%
Don't get cute with me.
All right. Hurry up.

99
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.500 line:82%
Gia, help him.

100
00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:24.667 line:82%
-Didi, did you see my new dolls?
-Gia!

101
00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:27.833 line:82%
This is Mother, this is you,

102
00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:32.625 line:82%
this is brother, this is me and--

103
00:07:33.292 --> 00:07:34.500 line:82%
You are awake!

104
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.333 line:82%
Looking so good, like Hari Putter.

105
00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:38.333 line:82%
Harry Potter, grandmother.

106
00:07:38.417 --> 00:07:39.458 line:82%
Whatever, it's all the same.

107
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.208 line:82%
- Good morning, grandmother.
- OK. OK.

108
00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:42.292 line:82%
What are you doing today?

109
00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:45.750 line:82%
Grandmother's love for Shiv was only
matched by her hatred for Gia.

110
00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:51.500 line:82%
Gia was adopted and probably that's why
she did not consider her our own.

111
00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:56.595 line:82%
And Gia, she always kept the grandmother
doll away from her perfect family.

112
00:07:57.625 --> 00:07:59.250 line:82%
Distance was not just
between the two in the family,

113
00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:02.333 line:82%
Guru Nanak and Jesus
had their own battle in the house.

114
00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:10.458 line:82%
It's so cold! Is the heater on?

115
00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:11.958 line:82%
You are always on, aren't you?

116
00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:13.208 line:82%
- What?
- Nothing!

117
00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:15.542 line:82%
- Will it?
- Shut up.

118
00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:18.283 line:82%
- Bet?
- Don't irritate me.

119
00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:20.000 line:82%
Chicken. It's just one dollar.

120
00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.833 line:82%
- What's for breakfast?
- Fruit and cereal.

121
00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:24.833 line:82%
- What?
- Cereal.

122
00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:27.167 line:82%
Has it started?
The serial, Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki?

123
00:08:27.917 --> 00:08:30.375 line:82%
Not the TV serial, the cereal we eat.

124
00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:33.333 line:82%
So what's new?
We eat that everyday.

125
00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:36.750 line:82%
Poor daughter-in-law,
she doesn't know how to make Indian food.

126
00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.500 line:82%
Our dear daughter-in-law, Jenny.

127
00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:44.875 line:82%
Do you know, Naina?
I saw a lovely dream last night.

128
00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:48.042 line:82%
In the dream,
I was eating hot potato flatbread,

129
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.792 line:82%
with lots of white butter.
It reminded me of Chandigarh.

130
00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:57.167 line:82%
If you miss Chandigarh so much
then you must go there.

131
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.833 line:82%
I'm going nowhere. If I leave,
what will happen to these children?

132
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.458 line:82%
I'm very concerned about them.

133
00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:07.078 line:82%
And I'm concerned only about them.

134
00:09:07.165 --> 00:09:09.417 line:82%
Yes, of course,
why would you be concerned about me?

135
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.167 line:82%
Who am I to you?
If only my son was alive today--

136
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.680 line:82%
Only if he was alive.

137
00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:15.600 line:82%
Stop it. Just stop it.

138
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.542 line:82%
Here's your dollar. You won.
As usuaI, are you happy now?

139
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.202 line:82%
And both of you...just forget it.

140
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.625 line:82%
My morning began the same way everyday.

141
00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:29.792 line:82%
Mama and Grandmother's fight,
followed by my angry walkout,

142
00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:33.875 line:82%
and then listening to my stupid neighbor,
Sweetu's, stupid chatter.

143
00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:41.708 line:82%
And what will you have?

144
00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:46.250 line:82%
Sweetu. Full name, Jasprit Kapoor.
Kapoor with two O's.

145
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.917 line:82%
My neighbor,
and unfortunately best friend.

146
00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:52.375 line:82%
She has two problems.
The weight that she never loses,

147
00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.538 line:82%
and the fact
that she never feels sad about it.

148
00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:57.058 line:82%
- TeII, Na...
- One doubIe expresso pIease.

149
00:09:57.625 --> 00:10:00.000 line:82%
Here's your letter.
It came to our house again.

150
00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.458 line:82%
Your name had to be J. Kapoor.

151
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.065 line:82%
- Naina! It's a blind date application.
- What application?

152
00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:08.875 line:82%
It's a very cool service,
it's very popular in New York.

153
00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.583 line:82%
Just fill in a form describing
the guy of your choice,

154
00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:12.750 line:82%
write something about yourself,

155
00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:15.250 line:82%
they match the details
and you get the guy.

156
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.167 line:82%
And what have you written about yourself?

157

- I have written the truth.
- What did you write?

158
00:10:19.583 --> 00:10:21.250 line:82%
That from far,
I look like Aishwarya Rai.

159
00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:23.250 line:82%
And up close,
like Aishwarya Rai's house.

160
00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:36.265 line:82%
- Sweetu, look at me.
- I see you everyday.

161
00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:39.322 line:82%
- He's so cute. He's so hot.
- Shut up.

162
00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:41.745 line:82%
All you are interested in is boys.

163
00:10:42.135 --> 00:10:44.542 line:82%
What will happen?
You will get the boy you want,

164
00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:46.542 line:82%
you will get married,
you will have his children and then,

165
00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:48.417 line:82%
he will leave all of you and go away.

166
00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:51.035 line:82%
What will you do then?

167
00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:54.500 line:82%
I will marry again. What else?

168
00:10:56.195 --> 00:10:58.055 line:82%
Forget it!

Bloody...

173
00:11:15.686 --> 00:11:17.833 line:82%

177
00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:31.000 line:82%
Youth, that she is desperately
holding on to.

178
00:11:31.083 --> 00:11:33.103 line:82%
and age that she refuses to accept.

179
00:11:38.144 --> 00:11:41.593 line:82%
- Customers!
- Hey, three coffee. please.

180
00:11:41.704 --> 00:11:42.768 line:82%

00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:08.282 line:82%
Thanks... mummy.

182
00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.165 line:82%
Look, I said I'm sorry Jenny.

183
00:12:18.546 --> 00:12:22.256 line:82%
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

184
00:12:22.687 --> 00:12:24.708 line:82%
With great difficulty,
we have four or five customers coming in.

185
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.237 line:82%
Thanks to you, if they run away,
what are we going to do?

186
00:12:27.358 --> 00:12:29.642 line:82%
- Listen to me.
- No, you Iisten to me.

187
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.750 line:82%
You know, if we don't repay
the loan from the bank on time,

188
00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:35.625 line:82%
we will have to leave this place.

189
00:12:35.706 --> 00:12:39.727 line:82%
Then, what are we going to do.
I mean what... Just go!

190
00:12:51.488 --> 00:12:54.250 line:82%
Oh god! This rain.
I hate this rain.

191
00:12:54.927 --> 00:12:59.240 line:82%
- Naina!
- Opps! Sorry. That's my friend.

192
00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:00.833 line:82%
I forgot to tell you about him.

193
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.080 line:82%
Meet Rohit Patel.

Karsanbai was one of the richest Gujaratis
in America.

196
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.292 line:82%

200
00:13:27.746 --> 00:13:29.367 line:82%
Hi guys. Have fun.

201
00:13:29.448 --> 00:13:30.959 line:82%

202
00:13:31.974 --> 00:13:34.796 line:82%
Okay. So, if I can get this fiIe

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:40.547 line:82%
Dinner at 8... 8... Dinner!

206
00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:43.165 line:82%

207
00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:45.288 line:82%
AII right. I'm going to
pick you up at 7.30.

208
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:50.333 line:82%
Poor Rohit,
he wasn't as cool as he thought he was.

209
00:13:52.172 --> 00:13:53.273 line:82%
But...

210
00:13:54.874 --> 00:13:55.955 line:82%
He never stopped trying.

211
00:14:07.645 --> 00:14:10.167 line:82%
- Hey Gorgeous!
- Are you taIking to me?

212
00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:12.690 line:82%
Who else?
You think I was talking to him?

213
00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:15.125 line:82%
My name is Rohit.

00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:19.437 line:82%
- Don't bother. I'm married...
- So what?

215
00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:21.875 line:82%
-So what if you are married--
-...to him.

216
00:14:24.974 --> 00:14:30.375 line:82%
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
- Put him down.

217
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.127 line:82%
Bye, take care.

218
00:14:36.788 --> 00:14:37.966 line:82%
Naina!

219
00:14:41.377 --> 00:14:42.765 line:82%
-So that's Rohit PateI.
-Naina

220
00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.042 line:82%
How do I know him?

221
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.518 line:82%
For the last one year,

222
00:14:46.602 --> 00:14:49.000 line:82%
we have been taking MBA classes
in the evening.

223
00:14:49.757 --> 00:14:52.910 line:82%
- Sorry, I'm Iate.
- WaIk.

224
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.417 line:82%
-What happened?
-Nothing, I was coming down in the lift--

225
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.375 line:82%
Understood. What's the girl's name?

226
00:15:00.042 --> 00:15:02.375 line:82%
- I don't know.
- Husband or boyfriend, who hit you?

227
00:15:02.655 --> 00:15:04.200 line:82%
- Husband.
- What was his name?

228
00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:07.208 line:82%
It could be Hari Prasad Chaurasia--
How will I know the husband's name?

229
00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:10.833 line:82%
- Rohit, I'm feeling so bad.
- It's OK, I'll be fine.

230
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.333 line:82%
He should have hit you more.

231
00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:14.417 line:82%
Thanks.
How was your weekend?

232
00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:16.905 line:82%
Fantastic! I went to London and Paris.

233
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:21.075 line:82%
I don't think so,
anyway my weekend was rocking.

234
00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:25.920 line:82%
Leila and I, in the same room,
on the same bed, all weekend.

235
00:15:26.588 --> 00:15:28.159 line:82%
- You know what I mean.
- Oh pIease.

236
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.630 line:82%
Oh...Ah LaiIa, stop it. Not there.

237
00:15:31.721 --> 00:15:34.125 line:82%
Stop it. No. Stop it.

238
00:15:34.496 --> 00:15:35.883 line:82%
Listen. WiII you!

239
00:15:36.374 --> 00:15:37.660 line:82%
Laila, no.

240
00:15:40.628 --> 00:15:44.292 line:82%
Thank God, you are not like
the other girls in New York.

241
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.292 line:82%
You are neither sexy nor beautiful
and you always have time for me.

242
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.820 line:82%
If it wasn't for you,
I would have died.

243
00:15:59.713 --> 00:16:01.733 line:82%
- I Iike you.
- Thanks Rohit.

244
00:16:01.824 --> 00:16:05.333 line:82%
Today is her first day, she is a divorcee.
For God's sake leave her alone.

245
00:16:08.458 --> 00:16:09.833 line:82%
- Please sit.
- Where?

246
00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:14.792 line:82%
I'd say in my heart,
but for now, right here behind me.

247
00:16:18.406 --> 00:16:19.883 line:82%
Sick!

248
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.444 line:82%
PIease don't, okay.

249
00:17:05.294 --> 00:17:07.958 line:82%
I wonder what Rohit wrote
in his black diary,

250
00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:10.167 line:82%
I never asked him about it.

251
00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:11.997 line:82%
He was mad.

252
00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:16.375 line:82%
When I met him the first time,
I didn't like him at all.

253
00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:21.208 line:82%
But today, he's my friend,
a really good friend.

254
00:17:21.792 --> 00:17:25.167 line:82%
Basically, he's a nice guy
and this I can vouch for.

255
00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:26.750 line:82%
You know why?

256
00:17:26.917 --> 00:17:29.417 line:82%
Because that night
he did not cancel his date.

257
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:44.792 line:82%
Rohit Patel, I forget
all my problems when I meet him.

258
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.375 line:82%
Are you all right, my son?
Hope you are not hurt.

259
00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:55.292 line:82%
What sorry? Can't you see?
What if my Shiv had got hurt?

260
00:17:56.292 --> 00:17:58.250 line:82%
What are you doing?
She's just a child!

261
00:17:58.334 --> 00:18:00.083 line:82%
Child? You have spoilt her!

262
00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:01.667 line:82%
It's her duty to take care of her brother.

263
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.542 line:82%
And yours,
to forgive not to raise your hand.

264
00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.958 line:82%
I haven't been able to forgive you,
so who's she?

265
00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:08.417 line:82%
- Forgive me? What have I done?
- Forget it.

266
00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:10.333 line:82%
No, tell me,
what wrong have I done?

267
00:18:10.417 --> 00:18:11.417 line:82%
Listen, just keep quiet.

268
00:18:11.542 --> 00:18:13.250 line:82%
The same comment every day,
please just say it today.

269
00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:14.500 line:82%
Don't make me open my mouth.

270
00:18:14.583 --> 00:18:15.833 line:82%
Why are you scared? Say it.

271
00:18:15.917 --> 00:18:16.958 line:82%
It's because of you, that my son--

272
00:18:17.025 --> 00:18:20.055 line:82%
Grandmother! Enough!

273
00:18:27.792 --> 00:18:30.333 line:82%
The fact that was known all these years
but never spoken about

274
00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:32.458 line:82%
was mentioned today.

275
00:18:33.585 --> 00:18:35.458 line:82%
Father's death was not accident.

276
00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:40.417 line:82%
He had taken his own life,
he committed suicide.

277
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:42.542 line:82%
The truth is always bitter.

278
00:18:43.083 --> 00:18:46.292 line:82%
No one knows the truth.
Not even you.

279
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.167 line:82%
Stop it Gia, stop it.
Don't cry now.

280
00:18:54.697 --> 00:18:58.145 line:82%
She hates me.
- No darIing, she doesn't hates you.

281
00:18:58.246 --> 00:19:00.454 line:82%
She hates you.

282
00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:02.542 line:82%
Don't say that.

283
00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:06.125 line:82%
She's angry now,
but everything will be alright.

284
00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:08.417 line:82%
When will everything be alright, Mother?

285
00:19:09.975 --> 00:19:12.417 line:82%
Do you know, when I was young,

286
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.778 line:82%
I used to cry over little things.

287
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.167 line:82%
My mother used to tell me

288
00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:22.042 line:82%
that Jesus sends his angel
to all of us to wipe our tears.

289
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.583 line:82%
Angel?

290
00:19:25.022 --> 00:19:27.685 line:82%
AngeI darIing, AngeI!

291
00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.708 line:82%
Our angel will come,
he will wipe our tears.

292
00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:33.250 line:82%
He will give us lots of happiness,

293
00:19:35.083 --> 00:19:38.917 line:82%
and will leave our sorrow
somewhere far away.

294
00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:41.250 line:82%
When will our angel come?

295
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:50.000 line:82%
Let's do one thing,

296
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.458 line:82%
today in our prayers,
let's ask Jesus for our angel.

297
00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:13.612 line:82%
First, you will meet him,

298
00:21:13.695 --> 00:21:15.583 line:82%
you will marry him,
you'll have kids, then what?

299
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.667 line:82%
And one day he will leave you all.

300
00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:21.042 line:82%
What will you do then?

301
00:21:22.042 --> 00:21:25.350 line:82%
I'll marry again, what else?

302
00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:46.708 line:82%
Please, give us some light
in these dark times, a little light.

303
00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:45.333 line:82%
And suddenly the season changed.

304
00:22:46.292 --> 00:22:48.833 line:82%
No one knows how, but moving aside
the gloomy clouds,

305
00:22:49.917 --> 00:22:51.708 line:82%
the sun smiled on all of us.

306
00:23:24.925 --> 00:23:26.250 line:82%
What are you doing guys?

307
00:23:26.661 --> 00:23:30.015 line:82%
Want to come & teach me, you shit.

308
00:23:30.116 --> 00:23:32.290 line:82%
If I could play,
I'd surely have played.

309
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:34.768 line:82%

00:23:42.542 --> 00:23:44.667 line:82%
Not strangler's, silly. Strangers!

314
00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:49.000 line:82%

I know he's a little stupid.

319
00:23:59.072 --> 00:24:02.660 line:82%
and I have also heard

321

Old.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.375 line:82%
Those are not beggars,
that's our grandmother.

What's the matter?
We were praying to Goddess Saraswati!

340
00:24:57.417 --> 00:25:00.208 line:82%
You were not praying to Saraswati,
you were torturing her!

341
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.042 line:82%
Now, Saraswati can't come here
herself, so, on her behalf I beg you.

00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:08.500 line:82%
-Don't sing!
-What?

343
00:25:08.613 --> 00:25:09.750 line:82%
What do you mean 'what'?

344
00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:12.875 line:82%
Just look at them,
these young children who are playing here.

345
00:25:14.292 --> 00:25:17.583 line:82%
It will have such a bad effect on them.
They will lose faith in music!

346
00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:21.333 line:82%
-And who are you to say all this?
-Yes!

347
00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:23.667 line:82%
I forgot to introduce myself.

348
00:25:23.895 --> 00:25:25.575 line:82%

Chadda's nephew?

351
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.000 line:82%
Lajjo, don't mind.
My nephew is a bit mischievous!

352
00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:36.667 line:82%
Chadda and Lajjo's love story,

353
00:25:36.875 --> 00:25:38.875 line:82%

- Chadda!
- Lajjo.

356
00:25:44.105 --> 00:25:47.125 line:82%
Lajjo, don't shout so much at this age.
If you do, it's straight--

357
00:25:48.875 --> 00:25:50.958 line:82%
If you guys are so fond of singing,
I will come and teach you.

358
00:25:51.042 --> 00:25:52.792 line:82%
Tell me, when do I play you guys?

359
00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:55.785 line:82%
Chadda!
He doesn't even know how to speak.

360
00:25:55.917 --> 00:25:58.625 line:82%
What's happening here?
What's this noise so early in the morning?

361
00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:24.833 line:82%
Nerd.

362
00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:27.750 line:82%
He comes to our locality
and stops us from singing?

363
00:26:27.875 --> 00:26:30.208 line:82%
We were singing so well
and he says we don't know how to sing.

364
00:26:30.292 --> 00:26:32.458 line:82%
- He's Chadda's relative.

I never knew that Chadda had a nephew.

419
00:32:27.708 --> 00:32:28.846 line:82%
I didn't even know

420
00:32:28.917 --> 00:32:31.083 line:82%
that my uncle's neighbors
are so beautiful.

421
00:32:31.542 --> 00:32:33.083 line:82%
I was talking about your mother.

422
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.000 line:82%
That shows on your face.

423
00:32:50.463 --> 00:32:51.470 line:82%
Do you know,

424
00:32:51.583 --> 00:32:54.833 line:82%
I saw so much color together in our street
for the first time today?

425
00:32:55.583 --> 00:32:57.125 line:82%
It's a boring sort of a street.

426
00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.583 line:82%
But don't worry. Now that I am here,

427
00:32:58.667 --> 00:32:59.958 line:82%
just see what happens in future.

428
00:33:00.042 --> 00:33:01.208 line:82%
You must have come here
on important business.

429
00:33:01.292 --> 00:33:04.250 line:82%
- No, not at all. Just to get married.
- Really?

430
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.418 line:82%
Jennifer, I want to marry your daughter!

431
00:33:07.829 --> 00:33:10.803 line:82%
Do you mind?
I'm taIking to Gia.

432
00:33:11.172 --> 00:33:13.914 line:82%

wiII you marry me?

433
00:33:14.275 --> 00:33:17.030 line:82%
-Yeah, pIease...
-No... no.

434
00:33:17.119 --> 00:33:18.617 line:82%
Doesn't matter...

435
00:33:18.708 --> 00:33:21.583 line:82%
Just one thing, is she in a bad mood
or was she born this way?

436
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:23.875 line:82%
- She has always been like this.
- Don't say that.

437
00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:26.542 line:82%
- Please, don't mind her.
- This is a childhood problem.

438
00:33:27.735 --> 00:33:29.742 line:82%
Anyway, IoveIy to meet you aII.

439
00:33:29.823 --> 00:33:31.750 line:82%
I will see you guys
at about seven or eight.

440
00:33:31.834 --> 00:33:33.500 line:82%
- Seven or eight?
- For dinner.

441
00:33:34.042 --> 00:33:35.990 line:82%
At your place,
I'm your new neighbor.

442
00:33:36.073 --> 00:33:37.583 line:82%
Obviously you will invite us
to show your hospitality... won't you?

443
00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:39.910 line:82%
Okay! Okay! Okay!

444
00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:42.333 line:82%
Actually not seven, let's do eight.
I'm a bit busy.

445
00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:45.792 line:82%
After I go, she will be angry with you
for inviting me to dinner.

446
00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:48.125 line:82%
But don't worry,
it's a childhood problem.

447
00:33:48.209 --> 00:33:49.608 line:82%
She won't say any such thing.

448
00:33:49.685 --> 00:33:51.625 line:82%
Where was the need
to invite him for dinner?

449
00:33:51.709 --> 00:33:52.750 line:82%
Yes, what was the need?

450
00:33:52.834 --> 00:33:54.208 line:82%
One minute, weren't you there?

451
00:33:54.292 --> 00:33:56.458 line:82%
I did not invite him, he invited himself.

452
00:33:56.583 --> 00:33:58.625 line:82%
I tell you Lajjo,
Mrs. Sharma was telling me--

453
00:33:58.748 --> 00:34:00.208 line:82%
- Who?
- From Kunwari Kudi. She was saying

454
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.042 line:82%
these young good looking boys
come from India.

455
00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:04.208 line:82%
- and take our girls for a ride.
- Ride? For what?

456
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:06.125 line:82%
- For a card.
- For a ration card.

457
00:34:06.209 --> 00:34:08.333 line:82%
Oh Shut up.
For a Green card, what else?

458
00:34:08.417 --> 00:34:09.667 line:82%
Lord! Did you hear that?

459
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.792 line:82%
Lord, please protect us.

460
00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:16.292 line:82%
Oh forget it aunty. It's just one guy.

461
00:34:16.375 --> 00:34:18.375 line:82%
I can handle an entire army.

462
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.167 line:82%

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.750 line:82%
You old hag! I'm running out of here.

619
00:41:51.833 --> 00:41:54.000 line:82%
This doesn't work for me.
And this Specs,

620
00:41:54.083 --> 00:41:56.917 line:82%
she's like cactus, thorny.
What Sweetu is she man?

621
00:41:57.042 --> 00:41:58.708 line:82%
- You are Sweetu?
- Who are you?

622
00:41:58.792 --> 00:41:59.833 line:82%
You are mine.

623
00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:01.000 line:82%
Look, I have come to the wrong house.

624
00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:02.958 line:82%
I came to meet Naina, I'm going.

625
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.708 line:82%
- Please, don't go.
- I'm going.

626
00:42:07.035 --> 00:42:09.708 line:82%
If you need any DVDs or video tapes,
you must come to my shop.

627
00:42:09.792 --> 00:42:10.833 line:82%
- You'll come, won't you?
- Yes!

628
00:42:10.917 --> 00:42:12.425 line:82%
Please don't go.

629
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.470 line:82%
Let me go.
For God's sake, let me go!

630
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.375 line:82%
- You!
- Are you alright?

631
00:42:25.458 --> 00:42:26.542 line:82%
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine

632
00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:27.625 line:82%
Those guys are lunatics!

633
00:42:28.196 --> 00:42:30.545 line:82%
- I wiII caII you Iater.
- I wiII also caII you Iater.

634
00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:34.833 line:82%
Run! Run!

635
00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:45.333 line:82%
You are laughing?

636
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.958 line:82%
Normal people find such situations funny.

637
00:42:48.089 --> 00:42:50.458 line:82%
Are you trying to say, I'm not normal?

638
00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.583 line:82%
If you are normal, then I'm Sridevi.

639
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.667 line:82%
You are not normal.

640
00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.708 line:82%
Since morning, you have been behaving
like you have known us for years.

641
00:42:59.792 --> 00:43:01.375 line:82%
Not years, darling. For ages.

642
00:43:01.542 --> 00:43:03.708 line:82%
In fact, I feel our bond
is from several past lifetimes.

643
00:43:03.792 --> 00:43:06.500 line:82%
Listen, you are our neighbor
so behave like one.

644
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.042 line:82%
Open the door.
May I please borrow half a cup of milk?

645
00:43:10.875 --> 00:43:12.542 line:82%
Didn't you just say that I should behave
like a neighbor?

646
00:43:12.708 --> 00:43:14.208 line:82%
So, may I have half a cup of milk?

647
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.792 line:82%
Look. Please take this
happy-go-lucky nature

648
00:43:18.917 --> 00:43:20.500 line:82%
and knock on someone else's door.

649
00:43:20.879 --> 00:43:22.569 line:82%
And we're genuineIy
not interested.

650
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.490 line:82%
And I'm warning you.

651
00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:26.917 line:82%
- What happened?
- What's your problem?

652
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.000 line:82%
- Problem?
- Yes, why do you feel

653
00:43:30.083 --> 00:43:32.242 line:82%
that the entire weight of the world
is on your delicate shoulders?

654
00:43:32.314 --> 00:43:35.183 line:82%
Who are you? Don't...

655
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.708 line:82%
What's the point of praying to God,

656
00:43:38.792 --> 00:43:40.500 line:82%
when you don't know how to value
the life he has given?

657
00:43:41.142 --> 00:43:43.792 line:82%
Excuse me! What do you know
about my life anyway?

658
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.958 line:82%
Not much, but enough to say

659
00:43:46.208 --> 00:43:48.375 line:82%
that in your eyes
perhaps you don't have much.

660
00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:50.917 line:82%
But look at your life
through someone else's eyes

661
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.375 line:82%
- and you'll know you have a lot.
- Now I have to hear a lecture.

662
00:43:53.463 --> 00:43:56.458 line:82%
Listen. Live, be happy, smile. Who knows?

663
00:43:56.708 --> 00:43:57.833 line:82%
Tomorrow may never come.

664
00:44:00.583 --> 00:44:02.270 line:82%
Tomorrow may never come.

665
00:44:02.917 --> 00:44:05.417 line:82%
Anyway, I will teach you to smile.

666
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.575 line:82%
It is a simple three part process.
One, two, three...

667
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.913 line:82%
Try it. One, two, three...

668
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.376 line:82%
Try it.

669
00:44:14.467 --> 00:44:16.623 line:82%
- One, two, three...
- Don't touch me.

670
00:44:16.708 --> 00:44:18.792 line:82%
God, the poor thing
has forgotten how to smile.

671
00:44:18.875 --> 00:44:21.500 line:82%
Just keep practicing
and it will come back.

672
00:44:22.168 --> 00:44:26.210 line:82%
- Your probIem is that you think.
- I know! I am very sexy.

673
00:44:28.835 --> 00:44:34.681 line:82%
But you are not my type.
For now, just practice.

674
00:44:35.522 --> 00:44:37.587 line:82%
- Forget it. I am sorry.
- One more time.

675
00:44:38.875 --> 00:44:42.292 line:82%
I kept thinking the whole night,
was that idiotic Aman right?

676
00:44:43.708 --> 00:44:45.583 line:82%
Had I really forgotten to smile?

677
00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:50.700 line:82%
Of course she smiles,
the last time she smiled when...

678
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.180 line:82%
Now she will smile
only during her wedding.

679
00:44:56.125 --> 00:45:00.208 line:82%
Whenever she was with her father,
she smiled.

680
00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.500 line:82%
When the big brother threatens her,
she will smile then.

681
00:45:06.625 --> 00:45:08.250 line:82%
What a beautiful smile.

682
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.833 line:82%
- Whose?
- Priya's, who else?

683
00:45:13.875 --> 00:45:15.250 line:82%
The wedding photograph.

684
00:45:16.292 --> 00:45:18.875 line:82%
- Where did you find it?
- It was lying in this file.

685
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.780 line:82%
I spoke to Priya today,

686
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.660 line:82%
she said you are meeting her today?

687
00:45:27.083 --> 00:45:28.208 line:82%
I was just going there.

688
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:33.840 line:82%
- Should I come with you?
- What will you do there?

689
00:45:35.125 --> 00:45:38.875 line:82%
In any case,
I want to speak to Priya in private.

690
00:45:41.708 --> 00:45:42.833 line:82%
Aren't you scared?

691
00:45:49.125 --> 00:45:50.133 line:82%
I'm not scared.

692
00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:54.260 line:82%
You keep worrying unnecessarily.
There's nothing to worry about.

693
00:45:54.375 --> 00:45:56.700 line:82%
Come here, everything will be alright.

694
00:45:59.167 --> 00:46:00.167 line:82%
Everything will be alright.

695
00:46:00.292 --> 00:46:01.500 line:82%
Nothing will be alright,

696
00:46:01.583 --> 00:46:04.333 line:82%
till you lose weight
you are not going to get a boy.

697
00:46:04.417 --> 00:46:07.167 line:82%
- But I'm trying, Naina.
- I can see that.

698
00:46:07.983 --> 00:46:10.647 line:82%
Wow! He is so cute, Naina.

699
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:15.860 line:82%
- He looks cute to you?
- You don't find any guy cute!

700
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.980 line:82%
- That's not true.
- I can't hear anything. No!

701
00:46:19.708 --> 00:46:21.583 line:82%
You were listening to our conversation?

702
00:46:21.667 --> 00:46:23.140 line:82%
I wasn't listening,
I was trying to listen.

703
00:46:23.209 --> 00:46:25.542 line:82%
If you speak so softly,
how do you expect me to listen?

704
00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.830 line:82%
Excuse me, move... move....

705
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.792 line:82%
We didn't meet that day,

706
00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:32.420 line:82%
I'm Ms. Grumpy's new neighbor, Aman.

707
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.542 line:82%
- Grumpy?
- I'm her old neighbor, Sweetu.

708
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.792 line:82%
- We were talking.
- Now, we are talking.

709
00:46:41.208 --> 00:46:43.917 line:82%
Look, Sweetu, Any guy who looks
at your figure and loves you...

710
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.208 line:82%
- He will be blind!
- ...will be wrong. Ignore her.

711
00:46:46.292 --> 00:46:48.695 line:82%
He should look into your heart deeply.

712
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.848 line:82%
- You're right.
- I am always right.

713
00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:53.792 line:82%
Tell me something,
is there a guy here that you like?

714
00:46:53.962 --> 00:46:55.115 line:82%
That one.

715
00:46:55.716 --> 00:47:02.232 line:82%
Yuck! I mean, yes!
RamdayaI?

716
00:47:02.792 --> 00:47:04.958 line:82%
His name is Ramdayal?
You know him?

717
00:47:05.083 --> 00:47:08.187 line:82%
No, but he looks the Ramdayal type.
RamdayaI?

718
00:47:10.248 --> 00:47:11.291 line:82%
RamdayaI?

719
00:47:11.892 --> 00:47:14.156 line:82%
- Yeah. CaIIing me?
- I am taIking to you, RamdayaI.

720
00:47:14.497 --> 00:47:18.010 line:82%
- Name's Frankie!
- Frankie RamdayaI

721
00:47:18.583 --> 00:47:21.917 line:82%
This girlfriend of mine
wants to leave me for you,

722
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.958 line:82%
she says you are cool, sexy,

723
00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:27.583 line:82%
she says your hairstyle is awesome.

724
00:47:27.667 --> 00:47:30.958 line:82%
What do I do Sweetu,
If I've not seen DiI Chahta Hai?

725
00:47:31.208 --> 00:47:33.625 line:82%
I don't know much about hairstyles.

726
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.577 line:82%
- Are you going to leave me for this--
- What?

727
00:47:36.188 --> 00:47:37.404 line:82%
Sorry, Ramdayal.

728
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.625 line:82%
How would you feel if I left you for her?

729
00:47:40.713 --> 00:47:43.365 line:82%
You are a Iucky dog, RamdayaI.

730
00:47:44.083 --> 00:47:47.000 line:82%
Go Sweetu, go live your life.

731
00:47:47.084 --> 00:47:51.125 line:82%
Be happy, Be prosperous.
Be happy with Ramu.

732
00:47:53.208 --> 00:47:54.375 line:82%
Is he coming?

733
00:47:56.042 --> 00:47:57.417 line:82%
Come quickly.

734
00:47:58.399 --> 00:48:00.234 line:82%
Come on... come on...

735
00:48:00.755 --> 00:48:02.451 line:82%
- Hi! Franky here.
- Hi! I'm Jaspreet.

736
00:48:02.542 --> 00:48:03.634 line:82%
Jas...what?

737
00:48:03.725 --> 00:48:06.487 line:82%
- Sweetu.
- Sweetu, sweet name.

738
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:11.000 line:82%
I DJ at Club Nirvana.
Tonight's the retro night.

739
00:48:11.417 --> 00:48:14.042 line:82%
Why don't you guys come along?
And get your mom too.

740
00:48:16.708 --> 00:48:20.219 line:82%
You take care, man.
Everything will be alright.

741
00:48:22.958 --> 00:48:24.125 line:82%
How did you like my performance?

742
00:48:24.522 --> 00:48:26.085 line:82%
- Awsome.
- Awful.

743
00:48:26.625 --> 00:48:28.792 line:82%
You are jealous,
because now Sweetu has a boyfriend

744
00:48:28.875 --> 00:48:31.319 line:82%
- and you don't, Mom!
- I do have a boyfriend!

745
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.836 line:82%
- You do?
- You do? Who's he?

746
00:48:34.377 --> 00:48:35.513 line:82%
Rohit.

747
00:48:35.583 --> 00:48:37.042 line:82%
But you said Rohit was just a friend.

748
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.833 line:82%
I said that because I don't talk
about my personal life to everyone.

749
00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.250 line:82%
But you should have told me.

750
00:48:42.333 --> 00:48:45.542 line:82%
Oh! Sweetu, don't mind.
We'll go to the disco.

751
00:48:45.625 --> 00:48:46.792 line:82%
Ms.Grumpy won't be there.

752
00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:49.208 line:82%
Rohit and I will come!

753
00:48:49.958 --> 00:48:51.084 line:82%
We won't go.

754
00:48:51.167 --> 00:48:53.487 line:82%
- But why? Rohit.
- I said no!

755
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:55.667 line:82%
Gita is coming home for dinner.

756
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.148 line:82%
You can do all this
but you can't come for dinner with me?

757
00:48:58.217 --> 00:49:00.363 line:82%
Naina, try to understand.

758
00:49:00.458 --> 00:49:03.208 line:82%
- Gita says she likes me--
- Why won't she say that?

759
00:49:03.292 --> 00:49:04.792 line:82%
After all she's found
a father for her kids.

760
00:49:05.833 --> 00:49:07.667 line:82%
- Liar!
- So she's a liar and you?

761
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.042 line:82%
I lied because
that stupid Aman irritates me a lot.

762
00:49:11.125 --> 00:49:13.292 line:82%
He just met you yesterday.
How can he irritate you so much?

763
00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:14.979 line:82%
- Do you know what he was saying?
- What?

764
00:49:15.167 --> 00:49:16.399 line:82%
You won't believe it.

765
00:49:16.583 --> 00:49:18.292 line:82%
That I don't laugh.
I don't know how to smile,

766
00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:20.250 line:82%
that I don't have a life.
That I don't know how to live.

767
00:49:20.333 --> 00:49:22.708 line:82%
Naina, all that is true.

768
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.667 line:82%
I know, But why should I hear it from him?

769

777
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:43.986 line:82%
Oh that....

00:49:44.507 --> 00:49:47.083 line:82%
That you are handsome, cool and sexy.

779
00:49:47.167 --> 00:49:51.459 line:82%
You mean that?
Do you really think I'm sexy?

780
00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:53.449 line:82%
Ofcourse, Rohit.

781
00:49:53.542 --> 00:49:55.834 line:82%
You are right! Just for that
stupid Aman we don't have to...

782
00:49:56.179 --> 00:49:58.575 line:82%
- No... No... Let's do it.
- Let's do what?

783
00:49:58.666 --> 00:50:01.489 line:82%
Me boy friend.
You girI friend.

784
00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:04.333 line:82%
- What about Gita?
- Who's Gita?

785
00:50:05.833 --> 00:50:08.417 line:82%
So we'll meet this evening at Nirvana.

786
00:50:27.518 --> 00:50:29.930 line:82%
- Yeah! What do you guys say?
- Having fun.

787
00:50:31.971 --> 00:50:34.567 line:82%
Sweetu, I'm going to the DJ cabin.
You want to come, babe?

788
00:50:34.625 --> 00:50:35.975 line:82%
Yeah sure.

789
00:50:36.076 --> 00:50:38.819 line:82%
Aman, he caIIed me Babe.
I Iove you Aman.

790
00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:40.873 line:82%
Now, go & Iove him.

791
00:50:41.828 --> 00:50:43.708 line:82%
By the way, where did you two meet?

792
00:50:43.958 --> 00:50:45.667 line:82%
- In the park.
- Park?

793
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.042 line:82%
In the park?

794
00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:50.542 line:82%
But I thought you two study together
in the MBA classes?

795
00:50:51.125 --> 00:50:53.458 line:82%
So what? Can't we meet in the park?

796
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.048 line:82%
Of course you can meet,
but what were you doing in the park?

797
00:50:57.139 --> 00:50:58.332 line:82%
Very good question.

798
00:50:59.833 --> 00:51:03.458 line:82%
I had taken my dog for a walk.

799
00:51:03.542 --> 00:51:06.187 line:82%
And she had taken her dog for a walk.

800
00:51:06.278 --> 00:51:07.392 line:82%
That's strange.

801
00:51:07.473 --> 00:51:08.708 line:82%
But Naina doesn't have a dog.

802
00:51:08.792 --> 00:51:09.917 line:82%
- Yes.
- No.

803
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.359 line:82%
I had taken my neighbor's dog for a walk.

804
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:13.578 line:82%
That's stranger.

805
00:51:13.667 --> 00:51:15.679 line:82%
I'm your neighbor, and I don't have a dog.

806
00:51:16.958 --> 00:51:19.708 line:82%
Naina, you silly girl, you're forgetting,

807
00:51:19.917 --> 00:51:22.573 line:82%
you took my dog for a walk that day.

808
00:51:22.654 --> 00:51:25.230 line:82%
Rohit, you siIIy siIIy boy.

809
00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:26.875 line:82%
If she took your do for a walk,

810
00:51:26.958 --> 00:51:28.875 line:82%
then whose dog did you take for a walk?

811
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:32.833 line:82%
I have two dogs.

812
00:51:33.042 --> 00:51:35.000 line:82%
In fact, I have a lot of dogs in my house.

813
00:51:35.083 --> 00:51:37.292 line:82%
In fact, at times even I feel like a dog.

814
00:51:37.417 --> 00:51:39.292 line:82%
And then we met at a friend's house.

815
00:51:40.042 --> 00:51:41.417 line:82%
What's your friend's name?

816
00:51:42.125 --> 00:51:43.750 line:82%
- Gita!
- Gita?

817
00:51:44.917 --> 00:51:47.750 line:82%
That same Gita with two filthy children.

818
00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:50.119 line:82%
HeIIo Gita, hi.

819
00:51:50.208 --> 00:51:51.833 line:82%
Rohit, what are you doing here?

820
00:51:52.208 --> 00:51:54.839 line:82%
Didn't you say that you were going out
with your family?

821
00:51:56.292 --> 00:51:58.226 line:82%
Meet my mom and dad.

822
00:51:58.317 --> 00:51:59.823 line:82%
He's a funny man.

823
00:51:59.934 --> 00:52:01.330 line:82%
Gita, my chiId!

824
00:52:01.417 --> 00:52:05.179 line:82%
I just got to know that
their love story was born in your house.

825
00:52:05.299 --> 00:52:06.375 line:82%
My house?

826
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:10.500 line:82%
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you the same Gita
who has two filthy children?

827
00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:11.981 line:82%
Filthy children?

828
00:52:12.052 --> 00:52:14.630 line:82%
- How dare you?
- Are you mad? LittIe AngeI.

829
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:17.208 line:82%
Shut up you liar. You didn't even teII me
you had a girI friend.

830
00:52:17.292 --> 00:52:18.387 line:82%
I didn't know it myself.

831
00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:19.825 line:82%
She is not my girlfriend.

832
00:52:19.926 --> 00:52:22.662 line:82%
You didn't even teII me
you had a girI friend.

833
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:25.458 line:82%
-Rohit, I'm confused, what's going on?
-Ask her!

834
00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:26.725 line:82%
Naina, what's going on?
I'm very confused.

835
00:52:26.816 --> 00:52:27.909 line:82%
You just shut up.

836
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.208 line:82%
You knew all along that Rohit and I
are not seeing each other.

837
00:52:31.292 --> 00:52:33.539 line:82%
- Then why did you act?
- Was I acting or were you?

838
00:52:34.179 --> 00:52:35.375 line:82%
It's all because of you.

839
00:52:35.459 --> 00:52:37.500 line:82%
Didn't you say "laugh, sing, smile"?

840
00:52:38.187 --> 00:52:40.984 line:82%
I didn't say he he he...
I said EEEEEEEEEEE.

841
00:52:41.065 --> 00:52:42.650 line:82%
Oh, pIease just keep quiet.

842
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:43.792 line:82%
What do you think?

843
00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:45.750 line:82%
Coming here, dancing, singing
and drinking, means living life?

844
00:52:45.833 --> 00:52:48.625 line:82%
Well anyone can do it.
But I don't want to do it.

845
00:52:48.708 --> 00:52:50.440 line:82%
That's because you can't do it.
You're a bloody bore.

846
00:52:50.531 --> 00:52:52.393 line:82%
You're a cute boy.

847
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.958 line:82%
- Tell me about Gita, she's very hot.
- She's very hot man.

848
00:52:55.042 --> 00:52:57.917 line:82%
- Is one of her two kids yours?
- Hey, you mad--

849
00:53:03.697 --> 00:53:05.081 line:82%
Nice, come on.

850
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:08.173 line:82%
Yeah, come on, go ahead.

851
00:53:10.164 --> 00:53:13.665 line:82%
- Way to go!
- Wow, Come on...

852
00:53:24.542 --> 00:53:25.855 line:82%
You naked girl, get down!

853
00:53:26.366 --> 00:53:29.449 line:82%
Hey babie, I'm taIking to you.
Come on get down...

854
00:53:29.542 --> 00:53:31.292 line:82%
Come on get down!

855
00:53:31.862 --> 00:53:33.917 line:82%
Get down you scum!

856
00:53:34.331 --> 00:53:36.618 line:82%
Hey, stop this music.

857
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.667 line:82%
She's taking her clothes off.

858
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:59.955 line:82%
That doesn't matter.
Everyone here is nude anyway.

859
00:54:01.416 --> 00:54:02.430 line:82%

904
00:58:52.167 --> 00:58:56.214 line:82%
Naina fell down.
Rohit also fell down.

905
00:58:56.315 --> 00:59:00.262 line:82%
Okay, then.

906
00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:07.125 line:82%
- Naina, What's going on here?
- How dare he? Let's leave--

907
00:59:07.417 --> 00:59:09.000 line:82%
Who are you?

908
00:59:09.292 --> 00:59:11.708 line:82%
I'm Aman and you are Naina.

909
00:59:12.292 --> 00:59:13.542 line:82%
- And he is Mohammed Ali?
- Yeah.

910
00:59:13.625 --> 00:59:15.333 line:82%
Shut up. I'm going.

911
00:59:15.583 --> 00:59:17.833 line:82%
What's going on?

912
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:22.500 line:82%
Why? Didn't you say laugh, smile, live?

913
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:26.125 line:82%
And now when I'm enjoying,
you say let's go home.

914
00:59:26.632 --> 00:59:28.615 line:82%
You are so confused.

915
00:59:28.708 --> 00:59:31.833 line:82%
Hey, even I'm confused.
Is he Mohammed Ali?

916
00:59:32.375 --> 00:59:33.958 line:82%
Shut up. I'm going.

917
00:59:34.042 --> 00:59:37.167 line:82%
- Now, listen.
- No, leave me. Leave me!

918
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:39.125 line:82%
- Listen...
- Shut up!

919
00:59:39.708 --> 00:59:41.250 line:82%
If you scream,
I'll slap you across your face!

920
00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:44.000 line:82%
- Why are you shouting?
- I'm not shouting.

921
00:59:46.917 --> 00:59:49.208 line:82%
Now you two hold hands
and start walking.

922
00:59:51.292 --> 00:59:55.759 line:82%
Idiot, not each other's.
Hold my hand and come on.

923
01:00:07.625 --> 01:00:09.833 line:82%
- What is it? Say it.
- Can I say something?

924
01:00:10.542 --> 01:00:13.000 line:82%
It feels like we are all going to school.

925
01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:18.919 line:82%
Yes, dad used to hold my hands like this
and take me to school.

926
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:24.959 line:82%
- What happened to you?
- I miss Dad.

927
01:00:25.739 --> 01:00:27.839 line:82%
I'm sorry, when did he die?

928
01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:31.559 line:82%
He's alive!
Can't I just miss him?

929
01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:35.792 line:82%
I miss my Dad very much.

930
01:00:37.042 --> 01:00:39.375 line:82%
I don't know why he had
to leave us and go away.

931
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:41.112 line:82%
I miss him.

932
01:00:42.783 --> 01:00:45.504 line:82%
- Yeah,
- Thank you sir.

933
01:00:46.995 --> 01:00:48.225 line:82%
Hey! Naina!

934
01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:51.625 line:82%
You don't look nice when you cry.

935
01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:53.899 line:82%
You look nice when you are angry.

936
01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:56.699 line:82%
Whenever you miss your father,

937
01:00:57.208 --> 01:00:59.625 line:82%
think about me, you'll get angry.

938
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:06.292 line:82%
I really like you.
I like you.

939
01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:10.485 line:82%
My day is not complete
until I have met you.

940
01:01:17.179 --> 01:01:18.854 line:82%
You are so cute.

941
01:01:18.955 --> 01:01:21.812 line:82%
Hey, I'm not cute, okay.
I'm Mohammed AIi.

942
01:01:21.913 --> 01:01:24.089 line:82%
No, you are cute...

943
01:01:57.959 --> 01:02:01.280 line:82%
- Good mornign, LaiIa...
- Good morning, Rohit.

944
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:05.176 line:82%
LaiIa!

945
01:02:06.447 --> 01:02:07.702 line:82%
Laila!

946
01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:09.083 line:82%
You have learnt to speak?

947
01:02:09.167 --> 01:02:11.375 line:82%
Yeah-- What?

948
01:02:12.667 --> 01:02:14.375 line:82%
What do you mean speak?

949
01:02:15.167 --> 01:02:16.792 line:82%
Last night the two of you
had gone berserk,

950
01:02:16.875 --> 01:02:19.101 line:82%
I came to drop you.
Got late, so I stayed back.

951
01:02:19.612 --> 01:02:22.424 line:82%
- No probIem.
- Okay, can I've some water pIease?

952
01:02:22.515 --> 01:02:23.731 line:82%

Oh god! Iast night!

954
01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:32.573 line:82%
- Good morning Kanthaben.
- Kanta!

955
01:02:35.274 --> 01:02:37.917 line:82%
The newspaper and breakfast are ready.

956
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.667 line:82%
What should I get for the guest?

957
01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:41.799 line:82%
Banana!

958
01:02:43.667 --> 01:02:45.333 line:82%
Rohit, won't you introduce us?

959
01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:49.083 line:82%
- This is--
- Aman!

960
01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.500 line:82%
- And this is--
- Kantaben.

961
01:02:51.708 --> 01:02:53.333 line:82%
Kantaben, how are you? Ok?

962
01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:57.958 line:82%
Anything else?

963
01:02:58.583 --> 01:03:00.260 line:82%
- No.
- Kantaben!

964
01:03:06.667 --> 01:03:10.333 line:82%
- So you didn't meet Naina in the park?
- Park?

965
01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:15.139 line:82%
No, we met in the MBA classes.

966
01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.542 line:82%
You know, when I met her the first time
I didn't like her at all.

967
01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:20.139 line:82%
- But now--
- I know.

968
01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:23.875 line:82%
Isn't it strange?
You guys are so close to each other,

969
01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:25.208 line:82%
you spend so much time together,

970
01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:27.899 line:82%
you even take your dogs
for walks together.

971
01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:31.000 line:82%
Do you want more?
I mean do you want more?

972
01:03:31.167 --> 01:03:32.375 line:82%
No, no. No more.

973
01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:34.499 line:82%
With Naina,
I'm happy with just friendship.

974
01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:37.014 line:82%
Not Naina,
I was talking about the milk.

975
01:03:37.115 --> 01:03:40.557 line:82%
- Do you want more?
- Oh yeah, IittIe pIease.

976
01:03:40.888 --> 01:03:44.000 line:82%
- Anyway Thank you, bye.
- see you Aman.

977
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:49.083 line:82%
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

978
01:03:49.167 --> 01:03:50.667 line:82%
I didn't know much about Naina,

979
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.208 line:82%
but now I know everything.

980
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:53.750 line:82%
Thanks to your diary.

981
01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:57.000 line:82%
- You read my diary?
- Not all of it...

982
01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.862 line:82%
Only till the part where you have written
that you wear red underwear.

983
01:03:59.963 --> 01:04:04.317 line:82%
- Red underwear...
- Aman, that's not cooI.

984
01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:05.472 line:82%
You can't read my diary.

985
01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:17.232 line:82%
- Jenny! Hi!
- Hi!

986
01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:19.000 line:82%
How did you like the service?

987
01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:20.542 line:82%
I liked it. Specially--

988
01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:23.265 line:82%
- I'll come every Sunday.
- Jennifer.

989
01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:26.193 line:82%
- Coming father, coming.
- Okay I see you bye!- Bye.

990
01:04:26.792 --> 01:04:28.875 line:82%
- You?
- You? What are you doing here?

991
01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:30.125 line:82%
Wherever I go you follow me,

992
01:04:30.208 --> 01:04:32.417 line:82%
I beg you please leave me alone.

993
01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:36.700 line:82%
You are back? Please go away, go!

994
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:41.155 line:82%
Naina! I was joking, come on.

995
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000 line:82%
I want to say something to you.

996
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.333 line:82%
I don't want to listen to anything.

997
01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:46.292 line:82%
- You shouldn't say no in God's house.
- I...

998
01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:51.667 line:82%
Last night, for the first time I felt

999
01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:53.459 line:82%
that you are like all other girls.

1000
01:04:53.792 --> 01:04:56.879 line:82%
But for some reason,
you want to hide the girl in you.

1001
01:04:58.042 --> 01:05:01.333 line:82%
And one more thing.
Wherever he is,

1002
01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:03.167 line:82%
your Dad is looking at you.

1003
01:05:03.958 --> 01:05:06.259 line:82%
Your anger, your sorrow,
he's watching everything.

1004
01:05:06.719 --> 01:05:09.459 line:82%
And perhaps he's crying with you too.

1005
01:05:10.458 --> 01:05:12.139 line:82%
Now you can't wipe his tears from here,

1006
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.875 line:82%
but you can stop them
by smiling and laughing.

1007
01:05:18.318 --> 01:05:22.635 line:82%
With your dimpIe oops
wrong side... this side.

1008
01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:25.333 line:82%
And Naina, please leave my hand,

1009
01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:26.875 line:82%
what will people say?

1010
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.792 line:82%
Aman Mathur's magic was
spreading in all the directions,

1011
01:05:42.542 --> 01:05:43.875 line:82%
whether we liked it or not.

1012
01:05:44.459 --> 01:05:46.375 line:82%
Everyone was being swept off their feet.

1013
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.917 line:82%
On Aman's insistence grandmother, Kammo
and Vimmo had given up their music...

1014
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.375 line:82%
and had embraced a new passion to--

1015
01:05:54.625 --> 01:05:59.500 line:82%
♪ Kill us, Allah, kill us ♪

1016
01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:02.859 line:82%
Excellent, what a performance!

1017
01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:04.759 line:82%
And while this was the situation upstairs,

1018
01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:06.625 line:82%
downstairs was a cookery special.

1019
01:06:06.709 --> 01:06:07.709 line:82%
Half a spoon.

1020
01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:08.875 line:82%
No, full spoon

1021
01:06:08.958 --> 01:06:10.708 line:82%
- Half...
- Full...

1022
01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:11.917 line:82%
What did you do?

1023
01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:27.292 line:82%
Aman could do anything...
Anything.

1024
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:33.913 line:82%
- Gia's perfect family had a new entry.
- Aman. I love you Aman.

1025
01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:37.042 line:82%
And as for me,

1026
01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:42.250 line:82%
I was laughing, I had learnt to smile.

1027
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:45.208 line:82%
It was scary...

1028
01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:47.208 line:82%
So much happiness...

1029
01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:49.625 line:82%
what if sorrow was just round the corner?

1030
01:06:49.731 --> 01:06:52.499 line:82%
Hey, What happened?

1031
01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:56.669 line:82%
Why are you sitting quiet?
Has someone died?

1032
01:06:56.744 --> 01:06:58.631 line:82%
Shut up, Aman!

1033
01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:01.479 line:82%
I need some more time.

1034
01:07:02.005 --> 01:07:03.048 line:82%
No, you can't get time.

1035
01:07:03.142 --> 01:07:04.872 line:82%
The restaurant is going to shut,
you've to order now.

1036
01:07:04.942 --> 01:07:06.292 line:82%
I'm not talking about the restaurant.

1037
01:07:06.525 --> 01:07:08.221 line:82%
Priya! I'm joking.

1038
01:07:08.622 --> 01:07:11.377 line:82%
It's not the time to joke.
It's a serious probIem.

1039
01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:13.958 line:82%
I had told you
before you came to New York.

1040
01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:16.375 line:82%
What do you mean? Are you saying
I shouldn't have come?

1041
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.708 line:82%
When did I say that?

1042
01:07:17.792 --> 01:07:19.167 line:82%
Isn't that what you are saying?

1043
01:07:22.565 --> 01:07:23.607 line:82%
You don't understand.

1044
01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:27.550 line:82%
- I need time, yours and mine.
- Okay!

1045
01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:31.000 line:82%
I understand, Priya.

1046
01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:33.625 line:82%
I came to New York just for you,
because of you.

1047
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.958 line:82%
Now whatever you say, I will do it.

1048
01:07:37.042 --> 01:07:41.292 line:82%
And as for time, all my time is yours.

1049
01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:43.375 line:82%
How much time?

1050
01:07:43.792 --> 01:07:48.250 line:82%
We have to leave this place in two months.

1051
01:07:55.583 --> 01:07:57.458 line:82%
- Can I do something?
- God Almighty!

1052
01:07:57.792 --> 01:08:01.019 line:82%
Such bad days that we have to
seek help from a Gujarati?

1053
01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:03.559 line:82%
Wonder who's evil eye has fallen on us.

1054
01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:04.875 line:82%
Must be yours.

1055
01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:09.375 line:82%
And when did you ever help me
that you are feeling bad today?

1056
01:08:09.667 --> 01:08:12.273 line:82%
Mom please.
Now the two of you don't start.

1057
01:08:12.584 --> 01:08:14.879 line:82%
- This is a serious probIem.
- With a simpIe soIution.

1058
01:08:15.167 --> 01:08:16.542 line:82%
Shut up, Aman.
It's our family problem.

1059
01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:17.875 line:82%
That's why I'm saying.

1060
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.667 line:82%
- But we aren't--
- Shut up, Specs!

1061
01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:25.500 line:82%
Jenny, this restaurant of yours
doesn't run and frankly, it shouldn't.

1062
01:08:25.599 --> 01:08:26.708 line:82%
How will it run?

1063
01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:28.000 line:82%
Why should it?

1064
01:08:28.208 --> 01:08:29.679 line:82%
Just tell me what is available
in this restaurant

1065
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:33.499 line:82%
that isn't available anywhere else
on this street? Nothing.

1066
01:08:33.583 --> 01:08:34.792 line:82%
Come here.

1067
01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:37.500 line:82%
Why does that Chinese restaurant
do so well?

1068
01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:45.958 line:82%
The Bloody fools' restaurant works

1069
01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:47.125 line:82%
because they have got their culture

1070
01:08:47.208 --> 01:08:48.542 line:82%
and their country to this place.

1071
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:49.833 line:82%
- Did I say wrong?
- Not at all!

1072
01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:51.167 line:82%
We should do the same.

1073
01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:55.375 line:82%
We have a great advantage
which we must make use of being Indians.

1074
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.084 line:82%
We must get India to New York.

1075
01:08:57.182 --> 01:09:00.283 line:82%
- Yes, incIuding, Gujarat.
- Yes I'm with you.

1076
01:09:00.583 --> 01:09:02.958 line:82%
We have to get India here,
bring it to this small street and

spread it in all the directions.

1078
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.083 line:82%
Because India can do
anything, anywhere, anytime.

1079
01:09:10.208 --> 01:09:12.625 line:82%
- So who are they?
- They are Chinese.

1080
01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:14.583 line:82%
Chinese, Japanese--

1081
01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:17.750 line:82%
- But Aman--
- No, Jenny. You have to try.

1082
01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:20.208 line:82%
There's no harm in trying.

1083
01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:24.792 line:82%
because those who try, they never lose.
Never!

1084
01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.459 line:82%
Come on, everybody come on India.
You're with me, come on.

-Yes. Why?

1116
01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.959 line:82%
Why, what?

1117
01:12:31.792 --> 01:12:33.667 line:82%
God knows where you have come from

1118
01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.708 line:82%
and suddenly so much has changed.

1119
01:12:36.292 --> 01:12:38.789 line:82%
I mean you don't even know us.

1120
01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.187 line:82%
I just don't understand why?

1121
01:12:40.292 --> 01:12:41.542 line:82%
I did all this for you.

1122
01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:45.875 line:82%
I did all this because of you, Naina.

1123
01:12:48.792 --> 01:12:50.083 line:82%
Isn't that what you wanted to hear?

1124
01:12:50.977 --> 01:12:53.250 line:82%
- No, no.
- Good, good. I was just joking.

1125
01:12:58.792 --> 01:12:59.792 line:82%
Eyes.

1126
01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:03.375 line:82%
Have you seen your mother's eyes?

1127
01:13:05.292 --> 01:13:06.542 line:82%
There's a lot of pain in them.

1128
01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:10.333 line:82%
Whatever I have done,
it's for those eyes.

1129
01:13:11.542 --> 01:13:12.625 line:82%
I have a problem.

1130
01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:16.250 line:82%
I can't see any mother's sorrow or pain.

1131
01:13:17.667 --> 01:13:21.333 line:82%
Because mothers are strange.

1132
01:13:22.667 --> 01:13:25.000 line:82%
When God made them, he gave all things

1133
01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.750 line:82%
that were meant to be here, here,

1134
01:13:26.917 --> 01:13:29.125 line:82%
in their hearts. So this is where

1135
01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:31.708 line:82%
they think from, understand and love.

1136
01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.250 line:82%
And they have another problem too.

1137
01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:36.750 line:82%
They eavesdrop a lot,

1138
01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:38.417 line:82%
and start crying at the smallest things.

1139
01:13:39.042 --> 01:13:41.417 line:82%
Look, mine must be crying right now.

1140
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:46.750 line:82%
Crazy!

1141
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:53.125 line:82%
What?
I did so much for you,

1142
01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:55.602 line:82%
- at the least thank me.
- Thank you.

1143
01:13:57.417 --> 01:13:58.501 line:82%
Specs?

1144
01:14:06.237 --> 01:14:09.174 line:82%
Naina!

1145
01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:25.850 line:82%
Naina!

1146
01:14:27.375 --> 01:14:28.375 line:82%
What happened, Naina?

1147
01:14:29.375 --> 01:14:32.417 line:82%
I can't see anything!

1148
01:14:35.333 --> 01:14:36.375 line:82%
Now?

1149
01:14:37.208 --> 01:14:39.939 line:82%
What's going on?
The glasses are gone,

1150
01:14:40.857 --> 01:14:43.697 line:82%
you are looking pretty,
and now you are laughing.

1151
01:14:43.778 --> 01:14:45.498 line:82%
- I mean where's Naina?
- Shut up.

1152
01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:49.560 line:82%
- Whenever I am with you, I'm happy.
- How sweet.

1153
01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:52.167 line:82%
Rohit, can I ask you something?

1154
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.417 line:82%
What's to ask? My answer is yes.

1155
01:14:54.917 --> 01:14:58.375 line:82%
- Ask.
- Has it ever happened to you.

1156
01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:00.625 line:82%
that initially you didn't
like someone at all,

1157
01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:02.333 line:82%
then suddenly you like
that someone a little,

1158
01:15:02.917 --> 01:15:07.375 line:82%
- and then a lot, and then--
- Then?

1159
01:15:08.125 --> 01:15:11.958 line:82%
- +You know.
- Why are you asking me all this?

1160
01:15:12.792 --> 01:15:13.958 line:82%
Just like that.

1161
01:15:14.792 --> 01:15:16.642 line:82%
- Just like that?
- Yeah, just like that.

1162
01:15:17.063 --> 01:15:19.383 line:82%
- Naina, come on.
- I'm going...

1163
01:15:19.464 --> 01:15:21.423 line:82%
No Iisten. Come on, teII me.

01:20:53.963 --> 01:20:55.579 line:82%
- Aman.
- I love you.

1235
01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:57.735 line:82%
I love him.
Sweety I love him.

1236
01:20:58.708 --> 01:21:00.875 line:82%
I didn't think this would happen to me.

1237
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:02.333 line:82%
And with Aman.

1238
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.999 line:82%
At first,
I used get angry with everything he did

1239
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.417 line:82%
and now, I love those very same things.

1240
01:21:08.583 --> 01:21:10.459 line:82%
I think of him day and night,

1241
01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:15.219 line:82%
and I keep feeling like he is with me,
where ever I go.

1242
01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:18.708 line:82%
You think I have gone mad?

1243
01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:21.162 line:82%
No!
You are not mad, this is love!

1244
01:21:21.233 --> 01:21:25.193 line:82%
Oh my god! I am so excited.
You are in Iove and I'm in Iove.

1245
01:21:25.579 --> 01:21:27.333 line:82%
But what should I do now?

1246
01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:30.250 line:82%
What do you mean what to do?
Go and tell her.

1247
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.125 line:82%
It's not that easy, Sweetu.

1248
01:21:32.292 --> 01:21:34.875 line:82%
I mean,
I don't even know about his feelings.

1249
01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:37.333 line:82%
Until you ask her, how will you know?

1250
01:21:38.417 --> 01:21:40.900 line:82%
Go and tell her.
Be a man.

1251
01:21:41.975 --> 01:21:45.708 line:82%
Even I'm going to tell Frankie
about my love. You should do it, too.

1252
01:21:45.792 --> 01:21:47.125 line:82%
- Tell her.
- Tell him.

1253
01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:49.083 line:82%
- Tell her.
- Tell him.

1254
01:21:59.017 --> 01:22:00.409 line:82%
- Hello!
- Hi, Rohit.

1255
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:01.821 line:82%
Naina!

1256
01:22:01.912 --> 01:22:04.035 line:82%
- Why did you call him?
- You should have called her first.

1257
01:22:05.458 --> 01:22:07.875 line:82%
Rohit, I want to ask you something

1258
01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:09.167 line:82%
and tell you something too.

1259
01:22:09.708 --> 01:22:11.750 line:82%
Even I want to ask you something.

1260
01:22:11.958 --> 01:22:14.292 line:82%
- Yeah, tell me.
- Not like this.

1261
01:22:15.042 --> 01:22:17.539 line:82%
- Water's Edge at four?
- Cool.

1262
01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:19.323 line:82%
Okay, bye, see you then.

1263
01:22:19.424 --> 01:22:20.997 line:82%
- Yes...
- Yes.

1264
01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:23.091 line:82%
Today I'm going to say
what I feel for her.

1265
01:22:23.592 --> 01:22:25.606 line:82%
- I Iove you Aman...
- I Iove you too.

1266
01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.890 line:82%
Thank you.... you're the best.

1267
01:22:31.031 --> 01:22:36.840 line:82%
- I Iove you!
- I'm so excited. Thank you so much.

1268
01:22:37.542 --> 01:22:39.833 line:82%
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't.

1269
01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:46.477 line:82%
Kantaben.

1270
01:22:50.112 --> 01:22:51.135 line:82%
Keep the change

1271
01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:52.597 line:82%
She's here. Start...

1272
01:22:56.398 --> 01:22:57.623 line:82%
- Hi!
- Hi!

1273
01:22:58.284 --> 01:22:59.601 line:82%
Nice place.

1274
01:23:00.332 --> 01:23:02.415 line:82%
- Nice dress.
- Nice tie.

1275
01:23:02.976 --> 01:23:04.017 line:82%
- Okay, stop.
- Okay.

1276
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:23.917 line:82%
I Iove Aman!!!

1277
01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:35.670 line:82%
You Iove Aman. You Iove Aman.

1278
01:23:36.451 --> 01:23:39.441 line:82%
Oh god, you Iove Aman.
Yes, man.

1279
01:23:39.522 --> 01:23:40.542 line:82%
Yes, I knew it.

1280
01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:44.833 line:82%
I just knew that you were
hiding something from me.

1281
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.796 line:82%
I knew you would be shocked
with the news!

1282
01:23:48.207 --> 01:23:49.592 line:82%
Shock!

1283
01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:53.857 line:82%
I can't tell you how shocked I am!

1284
01:23:53.948 --> 01:23:56.007 line:82%
My god Rohit, I'm reaIIy nervous yeah.

1285
01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:59.667 line:82%
You think he loves me?

1286
01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:03.555 line:82%
He has to be insane not to love you.

1287
01:24:04.126 --> 01:24:05.653 line:82%
Come on Rohit, Iet's be serious.

1288
01:24:07.683 --> 01:24:09.059 line:82%
Should I tell him?

1289
01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.243 line:82%
- No.
- What?

1290
01:24:10.458 --> 01:24:14.375 line:82%
Go! Please, go! Of course!

1291
01:24:16.042 --> 01:24:17.500 line:82%
Ok, so I'm going!

1292
01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:23.489 line:82%
Naina, When you tell him,
please give him these flowers.

1293
01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.425 line:82%
Oh Rohit, you are so cute.
I Iove you. Thank you, Bye.

1294
01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:33.737 line:82%
I love you.

1295
01:24:35.598 --> 01:24:38.650 line:82%
Mother! I'm home.

1296
01:24:43.441 --> 01:24:45.942 line:82%
Hey Aman, It's me.

1297
01:25:01.995 --> 01:25:04.019 line:82%
- Hi!
- Hi, no thank you.

1298
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.943 line:82%
We don't want to buy anything.
Just kidding. Come on in.

1299
01:25:08.792 --> 01:25:10.542 line:82%
- Thank you.
- No, not now.

1300
01:25:10.667 --> 01:25:11.667 line:82%
Later?

1301
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:14.167 line:82%
It's good you came.
I just made some tea, will you have some?

1302
01:25:14.553 --> 01:25:16.217 line:82%
Oh god, Iook at your hair.

1303
01:25:16.598 --> 01:25:20.380 line:82%
Let me dry your hair.
Come here, be quiet for a minute.

1304
01:25:20.461 --> 01:25:25.792 line:82%
Catching a chiII...
Yeah much better. Sit down....sit.

1305
01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:29.292 line:82%
Now tell me,
will you eat something?

1306
01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.785 line:82%
- No.
- Good. There's nothing at home anyway.

1307
01:25:34.167 --> 01:25:38.195 line:82%
New dress.
Thank you. You Iike it.

1308
01:25:38.276 --> 01:25:39.279 line:82%
Just bought it today.

1309
01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.083 line:82%
I hate it.
Why did you buy it?

1310
01:25:45.458 --> 01:25:48.958 line:82%
- It's raining outside.
- I'm sitting in my house.

1311
01:25:50.042 --> 01:25:51.083 line:82%
I know.

1312
01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:53.134 line:82%
Even I know,
Naina, that it's raining outside.

1313
01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:54.311 line:82%
I can see it...

1314
01:25:56.032 --> 01:25:58.857 line:82%
Aman... I... I...

1315
01:26:01.168 --> 01:26:02.663 line:82%
- I...
- I have go it so far.

1316
01:26:04.208 --> 01:26:07.625 line:82%
What are you stammering for? Go ahead.

1317
01:26:08.167 --> 01:26:10.257 line:82%
- I am going.
- It's okay. I'm sorry.

1318
01:26:10.333 --> 01:26:12.200 line:82%
It's raining outside.
And your dress is very nice.

1319
01:26:12.281 --> 01:26:15.068 line:82%
Yes, come on, Iet's start...
Where were we? I...

1320
01:26:17.875 --> 01:26:19.250 line:82%
- Who's this?
- Who?

1321
01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.458 line:82%
That's me.

1322
01:26:30.375 --> 01:26:32.000 line:82%
I know that, but who's this?

1323
01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:34.792 line:82%
- That's Priya.
- Priya?

1324
01:26:38.667 --> 01:26:39.833 line:82%
Yes, Priya, my wife.

1325
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.792 line:82%
She is the reason why
mother and I have come to New York.

1326
01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:54.625 line:82%
I'm so silly.
I never told you about it.

1327
01:26:55.042 --> 01:26:56.250 line:82%
I keep talking about everything

1328
01:26:56.333 --> 01:26:58.375 line:82%
and forget to mention
the most important things.

1329
01:26:58.833 --> 01:27:01.750 line:82%
Priya and I married three years ago.

1330
01:27:02.292 --> 01:27:06.375 line:82%
And after marriage it was
the usual husband-wife squabbles.

1331
01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:11.208 line:82%
One day, it went out of hand and
I said some nasty things to her.

1332
01:27:13.167 --> 01:27:16.042 line:82%
She got angry,
she left home and came to New York.

1333
01:27:16.333 --> 01:27:20.000 line:82%
Her parents live here.
My mother and I followed her here,

1334
01:27:21.583 --> 01:27:23.375 line:82%
to take our Priya back home.

1335
01:27:24.458 --> 01:27:26.917 line:82%
But she's still angry with me.

1336
01:27:27.417 --> 01:27:30.625 line:82%
She says she needs more time.

1337
01:27:32.792 --> 01:27:34.723 line:82%
But I know everything will be alright.

1338
01:27:34.804 --> 01:27:36.815 line:82%
You know how it is?
Isn't she so pretty?

1339
01:27:38.167 --> 01:27:39.167 line:82%
Yes.

1340
01:27:40.625 --> 01:27:44.157 line:82%
Why are you crying?
Oh god, aII you women are the same...

1341
01:27:45.042 --> 01:27:48.000 line:82%
Don't worry,
everything will be alright.

1342
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.333 line:82%
I'm telling you,
everything will be alright!

1343
01:27:53.208 --> 01:27:57.167 line:82%
-Can I go?
-Please stay, Priya. I mean Naina.

1344
01:27:58.503 --> 01:28:00.265 line:82%
I'm reaIIy sad...

1345
01:28:02.566 --> 01:28:03.708 line:82%
Me too...

1346
01:28:05.379 --> 01:28:06.659 line:82%
I'm going.

1347
01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:09.250 line:82%
Flowers?

1348
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.083 line:82%
They are not for you.

1349
01:28:15.875 --> 01:28:17.292 line:82%
They are for Chadda uncle.

1350
01:28:23.333 --> 01:28:26.792 line:82%
If it wasn't for you,
we would never have met these nice people.

1351
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:32.292 line:82%
Stay happy.

1352
01:28:34.083 --> 01:28:35.250 line:82%
Won't you stay?

1353
01:28:36.417 --> 01:28:38.125 line:82%
No, aunty. That's it!

1354
01:28:40.333 --> 01:28:42.752 line:82%
Naina, it's raining outside,
why don't you take this towel?

1355
01:28:44.233 --> 01:28:45.962 line:82%
- Bye Aman!
- Bye!

1356
01:28:55.833 --> 01:28:57.292 line:82%
Do you love her?

1357
01:29:00.667 --> 01:29:01.792 line:82%
Who?

1358
01:29:06.042 --> 01:29:09.019 line:82%
There's no such thing.
I don't love Naina.

1359
01:29:09.167 --> 01:29:10.375 line:82%
But when did I say Naina?

1360
01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:16.583 line:82%
I don't love her!

1361
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:24.167 line:82%
I'm your mother.
You can't lie to me.

1362
01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:29.679 line:82%
So what do you want me to do?
Tell her the truth?

1363
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:35.000 line:82%
When you can't face the truth
after knowing everything,

1364
01:29:36.167 --> 01:29:37.917 line:82%
how will Naina bear it?

1365
01:29:40.167 --> 01:29:42.583 line:82%
What do I do, Mom?
What do I say?

1366
01:29:44.167 --> 01:29:47.667 line:82%
How do I say that for the first time

1367
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.958 line:82%
this heart is beating for someone.

1368
01:29:53.833 --> 01:29:57.250 line:82%
My heart is breathing someone's name...

1369
01:29:58.042 --> 01:30:00.875 line:82%
...And for the first time this heart
has loved someone.

1370
01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:05.148 line:82%
How do I say,

1371
01:30:05.232 --> 01:30:07.667 line:82%
"Naina the love from
this heart is very strong

1372
01:30:10.167 --> 01:30:12.708 line:82%
but the heart itself is very weak."

1373
01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:20.750 line:82%
How do I give her my weak heart, Mom?

1374
01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:23.250 line:82%
How do I tell her

1375
01:30:24.417 --> 01:30:27.625 line:82%
that the girl in the photograph
is not my wife,

1376
01:30:28.083 --> 01:30:30.792 line:82%
she is my friend, my doctor.

1377
01:30:31.417 --> 01:30:36.125 line:82%
Who's fighting day and night
just to keep me alive for a few more days?

1378
01:30:43.417 --> 01:30:44.917 line:82%
I'm dying, Mom.

1379
01:30:48.667 --> 01:30:50.042 line:82%
That's not true.

1380
01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:54.458 line:82%
That's not true.

1381
01:30:56.625 --> 01:30:59.542 line:82%
Priya said a transplant is possible.

1382
01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:02.333 line:82%
After that everything will be alright.
Everything!

1383
01:31:06.083 --> 01:31:09.750 line:82%
Everything will be alright.

1384
01:31:17.239 --> 01:31:21.859 line:82%
I'm your son, you can't lie to me.

1385
01:31:24.917 --> 01:31:26.459 line:82%
No, Mom, please!

1386
01:31:28.208 --> 01:31:31.542 line:82%
If you become weak,
who will give me strength?

1387
01:31:36.417 --> 01:31:38.542 line:82%
I will hide my tears and pain

1388
01:31:41.333 --> 01:31:43.208 line:82%
but will you be able to hide your love?

1389
01:31:47.042 --> 01:31:50.417 line:82%
It's not my love anymore.
It's someone else's.

1390
01:31:52.083 --> 01:31:54.042 line:82%
I just have to help it reach
the right destination.

1391
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:56.125 line:82%
That's my only dream now.

1392
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.250 line:82%
And God has to fulfill this dream for me.

1393
01:32:04.292 --> 01:32:05.500 line:82%
He has to.

1394
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:33.375 line:82%
Priya, I want to ask you something.

1395
01:32:34.167 --> 01:32:37.208 line:82%
Tell me the truth.
Do I have very little time?

1396
01:32:41.483 --> 01:32:43.065 line:82%
Ah! Aman, you know...

1397
01:32:43.336 --> 01:32:45.708 line:82%
That stupid face,
how do you make that face?

1398
01:32:45.792 --> 01:32:47.792 line:82%
I have tried so many times.
Is it Doctor's special?

1399
01:32:48.917 --> 01:32:51.167 line:82%
- What did you tell Naina?
- What's to tell Naina?

1400
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:54.083 line:82%
Actually Naina has a mental problem.

1401
01:32:54.375 --> 01:32:57.083 line:82%
She thinks whoever loves her,
leaves her and goes away.

1402
01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:00.250 line:82%
If I leave her too, she will go insane.

1403
01:33:00.333 --> 01:33:01.542 line:82%
She's half way there anyway.

1404
01:33:01.667 --> 01:33:04.599 line:82%
And anyway,
you know the effect I have on girls.

1405
01:33:05.833 --> 01:33:07.875 line:82%
Except me, of course.

1406
01:33:07.959 --> 01:33:08.959 line:82%
Yes, That's because you are taller.

1407
01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.966 line:82%
It will take time,
but will definitely have an effect.

1408
01:33:14.197 --> 01:33:16.328 line:82%
- You reaIIy Iove her, don't you?
- I do.

1409
01:33:17.249 --> 01:33:18.459 line:82%
I can't beIieve it.

1410
01:33:19.958 --> 01:33:22.542 line:82%
I have known you for so many years
but I have never seen you like this.

1411
01:33:23.819 --> 01:33:27.735 line:82%
- How did you manage this?
- It's kind of strange.

1412
01:33:28.958 --> 01:33:30.542 line:82%
All my life I ran away from love,

1413
01:33:31.333 --> 01:33:34.917 line:82%
and now when life is running away from me,
I have bumped into love.

1414
01:33:39.667 --> 01:33:43.667 line:82%
Tell me the truth, Priya.
Do I really have very little time?

1415
01:33:45.083 --> 01:33:47.875 line:82%
Can't anything be done?
Tell me the truth, please.

1416
01:33:51.542 --> 01:33:55.939 line:82%
Aman, as soon as you get a donor--

1417
01:34:04.542 --> 01:34:05.708 line:82%
How will it have effect otherwise?

1418
01:34:11.333 --> 01:34:12.417 line:82%
Is it having any effect?

1419
01:34:19.292 --> 01:34:21.167 line:82%
While it was a season
of heartbeats at one end

1420
01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:24.417 line:82%
it was a season of heartbreaks
on the other.

1421
01:34:25.458 --> 01:34:28.042 line:82%
One was my heart, the other was Gia's,

1422
01:34:28.542 --> 01:34:30.327 line:82%
whose Aman turned out to be unfaithful.

1423
01:34:30.638 --> 01:34:32.112 line:82%
I love you, Aman.

1424
01:34:37.792 --> 01:34:41.417 line:82%
And poor Rohit,
even Leila had found someone.

1425
01:34:42.412 --> 01:34:44.651 line:82%
But Rohit... Well...

1426
01:34:45.892 --> 01:34:49.576 line:82%
But the greatest heartbreak was--

1427
01:34:52.957 --> 01:34:56.400 line:82%
- He doesn't Iove me, Naina.
- Sweetu, don't cry. ReIax.

1428
01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:57.500 line:82%
Everything will be all right.

1429
01:34:57.583 --> 01:35:04.099 line:82%
He doesn't love me, he says he's confused.
SiIIy boy.

1430
01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:06.915 line:82%
- I don't bIame him.
- How rude is that.

1431
01:35:07.417 --> 01:35:10.917 line:82%
He wants to go to London
to join some bhangra group.

1432
01:35:11.125 --> 01:35:12.125 line:82%
Bhangra group?

1433
01:35:12.208 --> 01:35:14.375 line:82%
Yes, and you know what
the name of the group is?

1434
01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:18.000 line:82%
"Forget Daler, watch us".
What kind of a name is that?

1435
01:35:21.445 --> 01:35:24.201 line:82%
Tissue. Thank you.

1436
01:35:24.875 --> 01:35:26.958 line:82%
And while we youngsters
were nursing our heartaches,

1437
01:35:28.625 --> 01:35:30.333 line:82%
the elders were finding their mates.

1438
01:35:32.317 --> 01:35:33.344 line:82%
And can you believe it.

1439
01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:37.198 line:82%
Those stupid red roses
were back in my house.

1440
01:35:38.129 --> 01:35:39.172 line:82%
Enough is enough.

1441
01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:43.075 line:82%
And if red roses were in the house,
the red dress was out.

1442
01:35:43.756 --> 01:35:46.789 line:82%
Hi, I'd Iike to return this
sorry, not my coIor.

1443
01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.203 line:82%
- Oh, Hi.
- Not mine either.

1444
01:35:50.375 --> 01:35:53.458 line:82%
Hi! So, you didn't like it?

1445
01:35:53.625 --> 01:35:56.375 line:82%
- No, and you?
- No.

1446
01:35:57.907 --> 01:36:00.618 line:82%
- Nice dress.
- Nice tie.

1447
01:36:01.469 --> 01:36:02.750 line:82%
What happened with Aman?

1448
01:36:03.208 --> 01:36:06.792 line:82%
What? He's married?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1449
01:36:07.708 --> 01:36:09.458 line:82%
If I had known earlier,
would I fall in love?

1450
01:36:11.042 --> 01:36:13.208 line:82%
-Now?
-What now?

1451
01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:19.208 line:82%
First I couldn't fall in love
and now I can't fall out of it.

1452
01:36:21.042 --> 01:36:26.500 line:82%
But I have to,
or else me and my heart will feel lonely.

1453
01:36:28.792 --> 01:36:31.542 line:82%
You will never be alone.
I will always be there.

1454
01:36:33.342 --> 01:36:34.816 line:82%
Why are you being so nice to me?

1455
01:36:34.887 --> 01:36:36.430 line:82%
WeII... I'm a nice guy.

1456
01:36:37.531 --> 01:36:39.695 line:82%
If you loved me,
your heart wouldn't break.

1457
01:36:39.976 --> 01:36:41.859 line:82%
- Rohit!
- You see!

1458
01:36:42.167 --> 01:36:45.292 line:82%
That's the problem with you.
You never take me seriously.

1459
01:36:46.417 --> 01:36:47.708 line:82%
But when are you ever serious?

1460
01:36:48.792 --> 01:36:49.833 line:82%
Right now!

1461
01:36:50.167 --> 01:36:52.792 line:82%
- You don't really mean that.
- Not at all.

1462
01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.319 line:82%
You think you will ever fall in love
with someone again?

1463
01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.458 line:82%
My silence said it all,

1464
01:37:22.333 --> 01:37:26.167 line:82%
and Rohit realized that his first love--

1465
01:37:26.708 --> 01:37:27.792 line:82%
I have to forget her.

1466
01:37:28.708 --> 01:37:32.617 line:82%
I have to forget my first love.

1467
01:37:33.479 --> 01:37:34.835 line:82%
It's not that easy...

1468
01:37:36.206 --> 01:37:37.292 line:82%
lt's not that easy...

1469
01:37:38.125 --> 01:37:41.667 line:82%
...to forget your first love...
It's not at all easy.

1470
01:37:42.375 --> 01:37:44.958 line:82%
My first love, Dev Anand.

1471
01:37:45.333 --> 01:37:48.875 line:82%
My first and last love, Lajjo.

1472
01:37:49.083 --> 01:37:51.250 line:82%
- My first love--
- Love Chand.

1473
01:37:51.334 --> 01:37:52.334 line:82%
Kukreja.

1474
01:37:52.458 --> 01:37:53.458 line:82%
- You too!
- You too!

1475
01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:54.708 line:82%
My first love.

1476
01:37:58.042 --> 01:38:01.579 line:82%
Basanti from BorivaIi.
She said no, so I shot her.

1477
01:38:02.625 --> 01:38:05.539 line:82%
You cannot forget your first love,
you can never forget it.

1478
01:38:06.667 --> 01:38:07.999 line:82%
I will not allow you to forget.

1479
01:38:08.375 --> 01:38:10.933 line:82%
Listen, Rohit, if you don't call me back,

1480
01:38:11.399 --> 01:38:12.538 line:82%
I will do something.

1481
01:38:12.649 --> 01:38:17.128 line:82%
PIease Rohit...
PIease caII me back Rohit.

1482
01:38:30.125 --> 01:38:31.417 line:82%
What's all this, Dad?

1483
01:38:31.667 --> 01:38:33.542 line:82%
Nude girls, enjoy. Enjoy!

1484
01:38:33.667 --> 01:38:35.375 line:82%
I don't want to enjoy!

1485
01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:39.719 line:82%
Don't want to enjoy?
Is everything normal?

1486
01:38:40.625 --> 01:38:41.659 line:82%
What does normal mean?

1487
01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:43.542 line:82%
No, Kantaben mentioned something--

1488
01:38:43.625 --> 01:38:44.625 line:82%
What was Kantaben saying?

1489
01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:48.279 line:82%
That you are in love with someone.

1490
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.042 line:82%
How does she know about it?

1491
01:38:50.125 --> 01:38:52.819 line:82%
She knows you since childhood.
Of course, she would know.

1492
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.859 line:82%
Anyway, the love is not mutual.

1493
01:39:01.458 --> 01:39:03.083 line:82%
I'm telling you that I'm in love,

1494
01:39:03.417 --> 01:39:06.958 line:82%
I want to get married,
I want to have children, and--

1495
01:39:07.042 --> 01:39:10.239 line:82%
Children? Is that possible?

1496
01:39:11.042 --> 01:39:13.559 line:82%
Of course, it's possible.
Why is it not possible?

1497
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.879 line:82%
Yes, that's true.
This is America, anything is possible.

1498
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.239 line:82%
Look at my fate!

1499
01:39:18.875 --> 01:39:20.333 line:82%
I asked for a daughter-in-law,
and I'm blessed with a son-in-law!

1500
01:39:21.917 --> 01:39:25.958 line:82%
- Son-in-law?
- Yes, Kantaben was telling me that you--

1501
01:39:26.042 --> 01:39:28.833 line:82%
In the closet-- Forget it!

1502
01:39:29.838 --> 01:39:33.928 line:82%
Oh my god. No... no...

1503
01:39:34.769 --> 01:39:39.699 line:82%
I am in love with a girl.
It's all normal!

1504
01:39:41.583 --> 01:39:45.259 line:82%
- It's Normal!
- Normal?

1505
01:39:45.583 --> 01:39:48.915 line:82%
- Then what is the problem, man?
- It's a long story.

1506
01:39:49.292 --> 01:39:51.799 line:82%
We'll hear the long story later,
why don't you come home?

1507
01:39:52.125 --> 01:39:53.859 line:82%
Your Mom's been missing you.

1508
01:39:55.292 --> 01:39:59.148 line:82%
♪ My Rohit has come home
Lord be praised ♪

1509
01:39:59.239 --> 01:40:02.479 line:82%
♪ My Rohit has come home
Lord be praised ♪

1510
01:40:12.208 --> 01:40:13.458 line:82%
Now what is all this, Mom?

1511
01:40:13.542 --> 01:40:16.125 line:82%
This is mango juice, this is khus.

1512
01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:20.875 line:82%
Not this, all this dance, music?

1513
01:40:20.958 --> 01:40:24.292 line:82%
It's our silver wedding anniversary
rehearsals.

1514
01:40:24.417 --> 01:40:26.708 line:82%
We are going to perform that day.
What are you doing?

1515
01:40:26.792 --> 01:40:28.497 line:82%
I don't want to do anything.

1516
01:40:28.601 --> 01:40:29.848 line:82%
I mean...come on yeah.

1517
01:40:30.002 --> 01:40:33.958 line:82%
And by the way, how can it be
the 25th year of your marriage,

1518
01:40:34.167 --> 01:40:35.667 line:82%
when I am 28 years old myself?

1519
01:40:36.167 --> 01:40:40.833 line:82%
No, no. We are trying to hide
our age from the Gujju community.

1520
01:40:40.917 --> 01:40:42.371 line:82%
I'm sure that much of cheating is allowed.
Explain this to him.

1521
01:40:42.452 --> 01:40:44.445 line:82%
We are stiII young.

1522
01:40:47.917 --> 01:40:49.083 line:82%
And who are these people?

1523
01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:53.167 line:82%
- Now you are a GCGC--
- GCGC?

1524
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:55.908 line:82%
Good Catch Of Gujju Community!

1525
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.083 line:82%
But don't worry about them.

1526
01:40:57.167 --> 01:40:59.792 line:82%
We have found you a girl
and the marriage is fixed for Navratri.

1527
01:40:59.875 --> 01:41:01.125 line:82%
Here, look her photo.

1528
01:41:01.583 --> 01:41:04.042 line:82%
- And this is her horoscope.
- Absolutely.

1529
01:41:04.125 --> 01:41:06.292 line:82%
And look, here's the honeymoon brochure.

1530
01:41:06.375 --> 01:41:07.958 line:82%
Mom, he has got my honeymoon brochures.

1531
01:41:08.042 --> 01:41:10.208 line:82%
And that's not all.
If you have a baby boy

1532
01:41:10.292 --> 01:41:13.625 line:82%
we will call him Jignes,
and if it's a girl it will be

1533
01:41:13.917 --> 01:41:17.568 line:82%
- Jigisa. Their pet name will be the same.
- Jigi!

1534
01:41:17.679 --> 01:41:20.199 line:82%
- Okay?
- No, it's not okay.

1535
01:41:20.292 --> 01:41:23.833 line:82%

- Everything is normal, Dad!

1537
01:41:26.957 --> 01:41:31.876 line:82%
Why don't you understand?
I don't want to get married!

1538
01:41:32.207 --> 01:41:38.206 line:82%
Are you sure? Good Iooking & rich.

1540
01:41:39.727 --> 01:41:40.816 line:82%
Sorry?

1541
01:41:41.087 --> 01:41:44.035 line:82%
Hi, I'm CamiIIa.

1542
01:41:44.125 --> 01:41:45.250 line:82%
That's a very nice name.

1543
01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.542 line:82%
The phone number is better than the name.

1544
01:41:48.625 --> 01:41:50.333 line:82%
- Take it, take it!
- What?

1545
01:41:50.542 --> 01:41:51.917 line:82%
Phone number, note it down.

1546
01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:56.792 line:82%
And if the Gujju's were
forging new relationships,

1547
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.167 line:82%
would we Punjabis
dare being left behind?

1548
01:41:59.250 --> 01:42:01.750 line:82%
What are these letters,
private and confidential?

1549
01:42:09.125 --> 01:42:10.625 line:82%
This is our Naina.

1550
01:42:12.708 --> 01:42:13.958 line:82%
She's very beautiful.

1551
01:42:14.042 --> 01:42:18.000 line:82%
Naina, this Kamoo's brother
and his family. That is--

1552
01:42:18.167 --> 01:42:20.167 line:82%
This is my life, my wife Pammi.

1553
01:42:20.792 --> 01:42:23.000 line:82%
That's my elder son, Montu,

1554
01:42:23.292 --> 01:42:24.917 line:82%
and that's his, Mrs. Jassi.

1555
01:42:25.292 --> 01:42:27.917 line:82%
And that's my shy and coy son, Bantu.

1556
01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:31.141 line:82%
Hello.

1557
01:42:31.242 --> 01:42:35.583 line:82%
And I'm the eldest in the house,
Badi Biji. Do PP!

1558
01:42:35.792 --> 01:42:38.333 line:82%
- PP?
- Pairi Pauna, what else?

1559
01:42:40.708 --> 01:42:43.667 line:82%
And yes, I forgot,
these are my grandchildren,

1560
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:45.292 line:82%
Bhagat Singh and Bhagat Singh.

1561
01:42:45.542 --> 01:42:46.625 line:82%
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1562
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:47.875 line:82%
Two Bhagat Singhs?

1563
01:42:48.042 --> 01:42:50.958 line:82%
When there can be two films
why can't there be two grandchildren?

1564
01:42:52.333 --> 01:42:54.375 line:82%
You are absolutely right.

1565
01:42:54.542 --> 01:42:56.625 line:82%
Grandmother, I need to speak
to you about something.

1566
01:42:56.792 --> 01:42:58.167 line:82%
Can you please come with me
to the kitchen?

1567
01:42:58.250 --> 01:43:01.125 line:82%
Of course, she loves a lot.
Please have something to eat.

1568
01:43:01.292 --> 01:43:02.833 line:82%
Please, eat!

1569
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.333 line:82%
- What's all this?
- What do you mean?

1570
01:43:06.417 --> 01:43:07.500 line:82%
It's Kammo's brother and his family,

1571
01:43:07.667 --> 01:43:09.083 line:82%
they have come especially
from India to meet us.

1572
01:43:09.208 --> 01:43:11.000 line:82%
- They are very healthy and wealthy.
- That I can see,

1573
01:43:11.084 --> 01:43:12.084 line:82%
but what are they doing here?

1574
01:43:12.167 --> 01:43:13.861 line:82%
They have come with a marriage proposal,
what else?

1575
01:43:13.922 --> 01:43:15.675 line:82%
Oh... CongratuIations...

1576
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:17.250 line:82%
- Why don't you get married then?
- Naina!

1577
01:43:17.875 --> 01:43:19.000 line:82%
They can hear everything.

1578
01:43:19.083 --> 01:43:20.833 line:82%
- Tell them to leave immediately.
- Why should they leave?

1579
01:43:21.333 --> 01:43:22.542 line:82%
You are 23 years old already,

1580
01:43:22.625 --> 01:43:24.708 line:82%
if you don't marry,
what will our community say?

1581
01:43:24.958 --> 01:43:27.667 line:82%
I don't care what your community
says or what you think.

1582
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:29.458 line:82%
- I'm not interested in getting married.
- How can that be?

1583
01:43:29.625 --> 01:43:31.500 line:82%
If you are so interested in marriage
why don't you get married?

1584
01:43:31.708 --> 01:43:33.250 line:82%
I'm sure Chaddaji will be ready for that.

1585
01:43:33.667 --> 01:43:36.250 line:82%
They can hear everything.
See how rude she is!

1586
01:43:36.333 --> 01:43:37.667 line:82%
It's all because of you.

1587
01:43:37.833 --> 01:43:39.458 line:82%
If you were not running
after that stupid hotel,

1588
01:43:39.542 --> 01:43:41.292 line:82%
you wouldn't have forgotten
your duties as a mother.

1589
01:43:41.375 --> 01:43:42.583 line:82%
I remember my duties as a mother.

1590
01:43:42.708 --> 01:43:44.042 line:82%
You are forgetting
that besides being a mother,

1591
01:43:44.125 --> 01:43:46.750 line:82%
- I also have the duties of a father.
- And whose fault is that?

1592
01:43:46.833 --> 01:43:48.083 line:82%
Just stop it?

1593
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:51.083 line:82%
You are talking about duties?

1594
01:43:51.379 --> 01:43:53.699 line:82%
It's the duty of a family to teach love.

1595
01:43:54.333 --> 01:43:57.339 line:82%
Children in other families
have grown up watching love,

1596
01:43:57.750 --> 01:44:00.999 line:82%
we have only seen your hatred,
only your hatred!

1597
01:44:02.333 --> 01:44:03.632 line:82%
After dad's death,

1598
01:44:03.715 --> 01:44:07.208 line:82%
has there been a single day
when the two of you haven't fought?

1599
01:44:08.083 --> 01:44:10.779 line:82%
Who would want to forge a bond
with these broken relationships?

1600
01:44:11.250 --> 01:44:14.559 line:82%
Who would want to marry me?
Tell me, who would want to marry me?

1601
01:44:17.125 --> 01:44:20.292 line:82%
Hello, so you guys want to marry
into this family?

1602
01:44:20.833 --> 01:44:23.875 line:82%
Bad idea! We are all mad
and we will drive all of you mad too!

1603
01:44:27.625 --> 01:44:30.125 line:82%
Please, eat that big laddoo.

1604
01:44:52.833 --> 01:44:57.083 line:82%
You love Aman and he's married.

1605
01:44:59.083 --> 01:45:00.583 line:82%
Why did you fall in love, Naina?

1606
01:45:03.125 --> 01:45:05.273 line:82%
If I'd known earlier,
would I have fallen in love?

1607
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000 line:82%
No.

1608
01:45:11.559 --> 01:45:12.750 line:82%
Now, why are you crying?

1609
01:45:12.833 --> 01:45:15.059 line:82%
Because I know you very well.

1610
01:45:15.958 --> 01:45:17.559 line:82%
You will never be able to take this pain.

1611
01:45:18.042 --> 01:45:19.417 line:82%
You will never be happy.

1612
01:45:21.292 --> 01:45:22.875 line:82%
You will never fall in love again.

1613
01:45:23.792 --> 01:45:25.399 line:82%
You will never marry.

1614
01:45:25.917 --> 01:45:28.439 line:82%
- You will be all alone, just like me.
- Yes.

1615
01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:31.779 line:82%
How can you agree with me?

1616
01:45:31.875 --> 01:45:34.659 line:82%
You should be consoling me.
You should be telling me, ''No Mom,".

1617
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:38.958 line:82%
''I will be happy, I will love again,
I will marry!'' And you are saying yes.

1618
01:45:39.084 --> 01:45:40.327 line:82%
How can I console?

1619
01:45:41.038 --> 01:45:44.323 line:82%
I love him, Mom. I really love him.

1620
01:45:51.333 --> 01:45:54.579 line:82%
He harasses me, he makes fun of me.

1621
01:45:55.375 --> 01:45:57.199 line:82%
Wherever I go, he follows me.

1622
01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.429 line:82%
And he eavesdrops
on everyone's conversations.

1623
01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:02.099 line:82%
But, I stiII Iove him.

1624
01:46:05.433 --> 01:46:08.492 line:82%
Why do I Iove him?

1625
01:46:08.593 --> 01:46:12.292 line:82%
Why is this happening to me?
What should I do?

1626
01:46:12.375 --> 01:46:14.000 line:82%
Everything will be alright, my child.

1627
01:46:14.799 --> 01:46:16.439 line:82%
Everything will be alright!

1628
01:46:17.375 --> 01:46:18.513 line:82%

1630
01:46:25.083 --> 01:46:27.958 line:82%
he will make sure
that your life is filled with love again.

1631
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.958 line:82%
He will teach you to love again.

1632
01:46:31.958 --> 01:46:36.399 line:82%
You will love again. You will love a lot.

1633
01:46:38.833 --> 01:46:41.599 line:82%
Come on my child.
Let's go home.

1634
01:46:46.458 --> 01:46:49.625 line:82%
Even Aman wanted to fill
my life with love again,

1635
01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:51.759 line:82%
with Rohit's love.

1636
01:46:52.625 --> 01:46:53.699 line:82%
But Rohit...

1637
01:47:25.542 --> 01:47:27.500 line:82%

1638
01:47:27.947 --> 01:47:32.703 line:82%

1639
01:47:33.324 --> 01:47:37.127 line:82%

01:47:43.201 --> 01:47:45.545 line:82%

I want to make my life on my own.

1685
01:50:41.833 --> 01:50:45.708 line:82%
I want to stand up on my own two feet,
will you stand by me?

1686
01:50:46.552 --> 01:50:49.609 line:82%
That is sick!
That is cheap...

1687
01:50:50.050 --> 01:50:52.667 line:82%
I will never say that.
Never, never, never.

1688
01:50:52.792 --> 01:50:55.759 line:82%
Camilla, darling,
I don't want my father's money.

1689
01:50:56.208 --> 01:50:57.899 line:82%
I want to make my life on my own,

1690
01:50:58.083 --> 01:51:01.458 line:82%
I want to paddle my own canoe,
will you stand by me?

1691
01:51:03.739 --> 01:51:05.667 line:82%
I'm ready to marry you!

1692
01:51:09.167 --> 01:51:12.083 line:82%
Just listen to me--

1693
01:51:14.083 --> 01:51:17.667 line:82%
I don't understand,
how you let Naina go so easily?

1694
01:51:20.527 --> 01:51:22.779 line:82%
Ladies & GentIeman...
WeIcome to LaIaIand.

1695
01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:25.792 line:82%
Rohit loves Naina,
Naina doesn't love Rohit,

1696
01:51:25.875 --> 01:51:27.250 line:82%
She loves Aman,

1697
01:51:27.333 --> 01:51:30.250 line:82%
but Aman tells Rohit that he
shouldn't let go of Naina so easily.

1698
01:51:30.333 --> 01:51:32.958 line:82%
So basically Aman is insane!

1699
01:51:33.042 --> 01:51:35.250 line:82%
Who are you talking to?
I haven't gone insane,

1700
01:51:35.458 --> 01:51:36.833 line:82%
your brains have been displaced.

1701
01:51:36.917 --> 01:51:38.519 line:82%
Naina hasn't fallen in love with me.

1702
01:51:38.667 --> 01:51:41.199 line:82%
She just thinks that she has
fallen in love with me.

1703
01:51:41.292 --> 01:51:43.000 line:82%
She thinks? Yeah, she thinks!

1704
01:51:43.083 --> 01:51:44.739 line:82%
Now what does that mean?

1705
01:51:44.958 --> 01:51:47.417 line:82%
I am a new entry in her life,

1706
01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:48.779 line:82%
I just laughed a little with her,
made her smile,

1707
01:51:48.875 --> 01:51:49.917 line:82%
and she thought she is in love with me.

1708
01:51:50.042 --> 01:51:53.020 line:82%
While you have known her for years.
She takes you for granted.

1709
01:51:53.333 --> 01:51:55.339 line:82%
She is not going to dream
that you are in love with her.

1710
01:51:55.667 --> 01:51:59.419 line:82%
Now just forget all this friendship
business and show her some love.

1711
01:51:59.667 --> 01:52:01.625 line:82%
Whether she says yes or no,
leave it to her.

1712
01:52:01.792 --> 01:52:04.083 line:82%
But at least give her a chance.
You keep running after that Chameli.

1713
01:52:04.167 --> 01:52:06.099 line:82%
- Lily. Camilla!
- Camilla!

1714
01:52:06.165 --> 01:52:08.907 line:82%
But you know Camilla has really sexy legs.

1715
01:52:09.008 --> 01:52:10.309 line:82%
What legs man...

1716
01:52:10.915 --> 01:52:12.833 line:82%
- Shut up! We are talking about Naina.
- Focus on Naina.

1717
01:52:15.839 --> 01:52:17.659 line:82%
Naina's beautiful eyes.

1718
01:52:18.417 --> 01:52:20.059 line:82%
Naina's lovely face.

1719
01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:21.667 line:82%
Naina's fury.

1720
01:52:21.917 --> 01:52:22.958 line:82%
Naina's love.

1721
01:52:23.083 --> 01:52:24.579 line:82%
Naina's smile.

1722
01:52:24.667 --> 01:52:26.042 line:82%
Whenever she does, that is.

1723
01:52:26.539 --> 01:52:28.259 line:82%
Naina's hair, when she ties them up.

1724
01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.859 line:82%
Actually, I like her hair
when it falls loose.

1725
01:52:40.125 --> 01:52:42.419 line:82%
For you, of course--
I'm married!

1726
01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:45.000 line:82%
And what if you weren't?

1727
01:52:45.292 --> 01:52:47.785 line:82%
Then I wouldn't let go of her.
I'm not an idiot like you.

1728
01:52:48.086 --> 01:52:52.619 line:82%
I am taIking about Naina.

1729
01:52:52.708 --> 01:52:54.833 line:82%
- Now what do I do?
- You don't do anything

1730
01:52:54.917 --> 01:52:56.199 line:82%
Now whatever has to be done,
I will do it.

1731
01:52:56.292 --> 01:52:58.708 line:82%
You just do, what I tell you to do,
I have a plan.

1732
01:52:59.333 --> 01:53:03.039 line:82%
Six days and the girl is in love.
Just six days.

1733
01:53:03.292 --> 01:53:05.739 line:82%
But why six days?

1734
01:53:06.375 --> 01:53:08.333 line:82%
Because I don't work on Sundays.

1735
01:53:15.517 --> 01:53:16.583 line:82%
Day one.

1736
01:53:18.167 --> 01:53:20.579 line:82%
Naina waits for me everyday here at six.

1737
01:53:20.875 --> 01:53:22.679 line:82%
We go together from here to the class.

1738
01:53:25.167 --> 01:53:27.250 line:82%
- But you won't go with her today.
- Why?

1739
01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:28.919 line:82%
Because I said so.

1740
01:53:29.375 --> 01:53:31.979 line:82%
Will your plan bring us closer
or throw us apart?

1741
01:53:32.250 --> 01:53:33.899 line:82%
I have a theory about girls--

1742
01:53:34.125 --> 01:53:36.708 line:82%
The more you run after them,
the more they will run away from you.

1743
01:53:36.792 --> 01:53:38.370 line:82%
But if you run away from them,

1744
01:53:38.454 --> 01:53:40.375 line:82%
they will be confused
and run after you,

1745
01:53:40.458 --> 01:53:42.039 line:82%
to find out, why she is confused.

1746
01:53:42.125 --> 01:53:44.479 line:82%
And we have to take advantage
of the confusion of a confused girl.

1747
01:53:44.667 --> 01:53:46.083 line:82%
Even I'm confused!

1748
01:53:46.292 --> 01:53:48.299 line:82%
That you are from childhood.
That can't be helped.

1749
01:53:49.125 --> 01:53:50.583 line:82%
Do as I say.

1750
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:51.917 line:82%
Put this into your ear.

1751
01:53:53.417 --> 01:53:55.079 line:82%
- Put it where?
- In your ear.

1752
01:53:58.083 --> 01:54:00.419 line:82%
This device will be attached to the phone

1753
01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:02.539 line:82%
so that I can speak to you constantly.

1754
01:54:02.625 --> 01:54:04.979 line:82%
Now, just do as I ask you to.

1755
01:54:08.277 --> 01:54:13.334 line:82%
- Rohit come in pIease.
- AIfa Bravo CharIie, I read you.

1756
01:54:13.425 --> 01:54:14.792 line:82%
I have reached the college.

1757
01:54:14.958 --> 01:54:18.460 line:82%
Good soldier, now relax.
At ease. At ease. Yeah!

1758
01:54:18.542 --> 01:54:19.679 line:82%
Loosen your tie.

1759
01:54:20.042 --> 01:54:21.583 line:82%
For God's sake, change your walk.

1760
01:54:21.833 --> 01:54:23.889 line:82%
- Walk?
- Yes, your walking style.

1761
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.945 line:82%
I mean cooI waIk, you know?

1762
01:54:34.542 --> 01:54:36.119 line:82%
- Have you reached the classroom?
- Yes.

1763
01:54:36.542 --> 01:54:39.559 line:82%
So stop shaking, idiot!
Can you see Naina?

1764
01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:42.833 line:82%
- Yes.
- Shut your mouth, duffer.

1765
01:54:42.917 --> 01:54:44.917 line:82%
Go and sit next to her
but don't speak to her.

1766
01:54:45.583 --> 01:54:48.000 line:82%
Where were you? I was waiting for you
for over half an hour.

1767
01:54:48.083 --> 01:54:51.455 line:82%
You are always Iate.
I just don't understand this.

1768
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:56.083 line:82%
Don't look at her.
Look up, look down, look to the side.

1769
01:54:56.179 --> 01:54:57.879 line:82%
Not her side, idiot!
The opposite side!

1770
01:54:58.917 --> 01:55:02.792 line:82%
I'm talking to you.
What has happened to you? Are you ill?

1771
01:55:04.583 --> 01:55:06.708 line:82%
- Look at her angrily!
- Look at me.

1772
01:55:06.792 --> 01:55:09.542 line:82%
Not so subtly, over act.
Look at her angrily.

1773
01:55:09.625 --> 01:55:10.625 line:82%
Look at me, Rohit.

1774
01:55:12.208 --> 01:55:13.917 line:82%
Now, put your finger into your nose.

1775
01:55:20.268 --> 01:55:21.715 line:82%
Day two.

1776
01:55:22.667 --> 01:55:24.583 line:82%
And don't forget, cool walk.

1777
01:55:30.708 --> 01:55:32.292 line:82%
Don't sit near Naina.

1778
01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:37.449 line:82%
- Then where do I sit?
- Near some sexy girl.

1779
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:42.169 line:82%
Oh my god! It's Gita.

1780
01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:45.214 line:82%
- Okay, Hi.
- It's my birthday.

1781
01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:46.769 line:82%
Oh, Birthday.

1782
01:55:47.083 --> 01:55:49.105 line:82%
It's not my birthday.
Tell her that.

1783
01:55:49.476 --> 01:55:52.596 line:82%
- Hi, it's my birthday.
- Oh, happy birthday.

1784
01:55:53.027 --> 01:55:54.717 line:82%
- Hi, It's my birthday.
- Hi, Happy birthday.

1785
01:55:56.458 --> 01:55:57.759 line:82%
Put your cheek forward.

1786
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.250 line:82%
Did Naina see that?

1787
01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:10.829 line:82%
Now hold her, hold her tight,
hug her and don't let her go.

1788
01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.698 line:82%
Tight! Tight! Sorry.
Over and out.

1789
01:56:19.445 --> 01:56:20.783 line:82%
Day three.

1790
01:56:20.874 --> 01:56:22.363 line:82%
- HeIIo Rohit!
- Yes, come in Aman.

1791
01:56:22.454 --> 01:56:23.852 line:82%
- Rohit! Idiot.
- Yes.

1792
01:56:23.943 --> 01:56:28.439 line:82%
Do you want to say something?

1793
01:56:28.792 --> 01:56:30.539 line:82%
- You won't attend class today.
- Ok.

1794
01:56:31.379 --> 01:56:34.369 line:82%
- No, I want to go to the class today.
- Okay, Shut up.

1795
01:56:34.917 --> 01:56:38.379 line:82%
Your plan is all rubbish!
I haven't spoken to Naina for three days.

1796
01:56:38.958 --> 01:56:40.208 line:82%
Even I haven't
spoken to Naina for three days.

1797
01:56:40.292 --> 01:56:42.439 line:82%
But you are not the one
in love with her, stupid!

1798
01:56:43.583 --> 01:56:46.739 line:82%
Don't worry. When Naina calls you,
you will not speak to her.

1799
01:56:47.167 --> 01:56:49.000 line:82%
- No, I will speak to her.
- No, you won't.

1800
01:56:49.083 --> 01:56:51.708 line:82%
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

1801
01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.971 line:82%
Naina, I Iove you...

1802
01:56:57.652 --> 01:56:59.542 line:82%
Sorry. It's your mother.

1803
01:56:59.667 --> 01:57:01.161 line:82%
See? It's always mothers
who come to the rescue.

1804
01:57:01.402 --> 01:57:02.655 line:82%
Mummy, I Iove you.

1805
01:57:03.417 --> 01:57:05.042 line:82%
Sorry.
Yes, I have taken the medicine.

1806
01:57:05.125 --> 01:57:07.405 line:82%
Why would I lie?
Mummy, Bye.

1807
01:57:09.042 --> 01:57:10.042 line:82%
And what is that?

1808
01:57:10.208 --> 01:57:11.500 line:82%
They are two fingers, what else?

1809
01:57:11.583 --> 01:57:12.659 line:82%
See, Naina didn't call.

1810
01:57:12.730 --> 01:57:13.875 line:82%
Sorry man, I asked.
See...? Naina didn't caII.

1811
01:57:13.958 --> 01:57:16.292 line:82%
Don't worry, I know Naina.

1812
01:57:16.625 --> 01:57:19.333 line:82%
She will wake up from her bed,
she will pick up the phone to call,

1813
01:57:19.417 --> 01:57:22.303 line:82%
but her ego will stop her.
Forget it.

1814
01:57:22.917 --> 01:57:24.208 line:82%
But she's your friend...

1815
01:57:24.292 --> 01:57:26.292 line:82%
She must be missing you.
So she will get up again,

1816
01:57:26.458 --> 01:57:28.500 line:82%
she will pick up the phone again,
and she will curse you twice.

1817
01:57:28.597 --> 01:57:30.255 line:82%
- Idiot! Moron.
- She'll definitely call.

1818
01:57:34.625 --> 01:57:36.875 line:82%
I don't believe you,
that must be your mother again.

1819
01:57:36.958 --> 01:57:38.250 line:82%
- Don't make fun of my mother!
- What did I say?

1820
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:46.167 line:82%
Oh, my God!

1821
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:49.833 line:82%
- What happened to her?
- I don't know.

1822
01:57:52.875 --> 01:57:54.458 line:82%
Today, you will speak to Naina.

1823
01:57:54.542 --> 01:57:57.890 line:82%
And you will say what we discussed.
Understood?

1824
01:57:57.981 --> 01:57:59.380 line:82%
- Hi Naina...
- Hi Lee.

1825
01:57:59.461 --> 01:58:01.239 line:82%
- Thank you for your notes.
- Your welcome.

1826
01:58:03.287 --> 01:58:04.418 line:82%
Day four.

1827
01:58:04.859 --> 01:58:06.354 line:82%
Hi, Naina!

1828
01:58:06.455 --> 01:58:09.250 line:82%
Just a second--
How far can you run from me, darling?

1829
01:58:09.333 --> 01:58:10.625 line:82%
Just leave my hand.

1830
01:58:10.708 --> 01:58:12.208 line:82%
I don't know what's happened to you,
I think you have gone mad.

1831
01:58:13.167 --> 01:58:15.667 line:82%
For the past three days, I have been
trying-- Where were you, Rohit?

1832
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:17.458 line:82%
When I needed a friend, where were you?

1833
01:58:17.542 --> 01:58:20.292 line:82%
I'm tired,
I'm really tired of being your friend.

1834
01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:23.057 line:82%
When you want to laugh, it's Rohit.
When you want to cry, it's Rohit.

1835
01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:24.915 line:82%
But when you have to love,
it's someone else!

1836
01:58:25.026 --> 01:58:26.430 line:82%
It's not going to work anymore, right?

1837
01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:29.063 line:82%
- Are you alright, Rohit?
- No, no. You listen to me.

1838
01:58:29.167 --> 01:58:30.667 line:82%
- We are friends, right?
- Yes.

1839
01:58:30.792 --> 01:58:33.375 line:82%
So a very intelligent man has said,

1840
01:58:33.458 --> 01:58:35.167 line:82%
the first step to love is friendship,

1841
01:58:35.458 --> 01:58:36.458 line:82%
and the last step is friendship too.

1842
01:58:37.917 --> 01:58:39.292 line:82%
Only the middle is left.

1843
01:58:41.792 --> 01:58:45.779 line:82%
Take a step, Naina,
and you will find your path.

1844
01:58:48.042 --> 01:58:51.250 line:82%
Think. Think.

1845
01:58:53.042 --> 01:58:55.167 line:82%
And to think I give you...

1846
01:58:58.542 --> 01:59:00.079 line:82%
my entire life.

1847
01:59:04.583 --> 01:59:06.458 line:82%
I wonder what Rohit meant.

1848
01:59:07.292 --> 01:59:09.333 line:82%
That day I felt
Rohit had ceased to be my friend,

1849
01:59:09.583 --> 01:59:10.879 line:82%
and become something else.

1850
01:59:11.583 --> 01:59:15.634 line:82%
And what that something else was,
I didn't know.

1851
01:59:17.207 --> 01:59:19.128 line:82%
Day five.

1852
01:59:20.159 --> 01:59:21.389 line:82%
Hi, Naina.

1853
01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.255 line:82%
- Hi!
- Hi, Rohit.

1854
01:59:29.346 --> 01:59:32.021 line:82%
Hi, Sweetie, how are you doing?

1855
01:59:35.482 --> 01:59:37.583 line:82%
This is for you.

1856
01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:39.750 line:82%
What's in this?

1857
01:59:40.333 --> 01:59:43.563 line:82%
My heart.
Just kidding.

1858
01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:56.125 line:82%
The red in here is the color of my heart.

1859
01:59:56.250 --> 01:59:57.958 line:82%
It looks wonderful on you.

1860
01:59:58.042 --> 01:59:59.619 line:82%
It's not a gift, it's a question.

1861
01:59:59.792 --> 02:00:01.579 line:82%
Isn't Subhash Ghai's film called Taal?

1862
02:00:03.042 --> 02:00:05.500 line:82%
Sorry, couldn't think
of a rhyming fourth line.

1863
02:00:06.871 --> 02:00:08.910 line:82%
Love, Rohit.

1864
02:00:10.001 --> 02:00:11.249 line:82%
Day Six.

1865
02:00:14.625 --> 02:00:17.250 line:82%
I'm not a poet, Damsel.

1866
02:00:17.542 --> 02:00:20.339 line:82%
Because I don't remember the next lines.

1867
02:00:21.083 --> 02:00:22.559 line:82%
Rohit, what's going on?

1868
02:00:23.167 --> 02:00:24.839 line:82%
- Look, I need something from you.
- What?

1869
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.374 line:82%
I have to join these dance classes
for Salsa.

1870
02:00:29.865 --> 02:00:31.749 line:82%
Dance class! Yes.

1871
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.875 line:82%
It's Mom and Dad's wedding anniversary,

1872
02:00:34.018 --> 02:00:35.868 line:82%
and I have to perform an item.

1873
02:00:36.179 --> 02:00:40.388 line:82%
Don't ask me, okay?
Look, I can't do that 'Dandia' Okay.

1874
02:00:41.250 --> 02:00:43.519 line:82%
So I thought, "Why not salsa?"

1875
02:00:43.958 --> 02:00:47.083 line:82%
I need a partner to join the classes.

1876
02:00:47.417 --> 02:00:51.723 line:82%
Since you are going to be my life partner,
why not start now?

1877
02:00:52.394 --> 02:00:53.909 line:82%
Babes! No!

1878
02:00:55.555 --> 02:00:58.083 line:82%
I'm just asking for a chance to dance
not to flirt with you.

1879
02:00:58.167 --> 02:00:59.167 line:82%
No, Rohit.

1880
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.208 line:82%
This is the last time
I'm doing something for you.

1881
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.917 line:82%
My boy, those were very fine lines.

1882
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.850 line:82%
Because they were from here.

1883
02:01:13.463 --> 02:01:17.705 line:82%
God, I really love her.
I love her too.

1884
02:01:19.958 --> 02:01:21.213 line:82%
I am kidding.

1885
02:01:21.894 --> 02:01:23.746 line:82%
- Dog!
- Dog!

1886
02:01:24.657 --> 02:01:25.898 line:82%
See you later!

1887
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.125 line:82%
I'm not a poet, damsel,

Red tie and a suit blue,
will make you look like a new you.

1919
02:07:56.667 --> 02:07:57.833 line:82%
Absolutely Dumb.

1920
02:07:58.708 --> 02:08:01.708 line:82%
Sorry, couldn't think of a rhyming line.

1921
02:08:17.042 --> 02:08:18.292 line:82%
Just look at me.

1922
02:08:19.333 --> 02:08:20.917 line:82%
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

1923
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.167 line:82%
Just look at this!

1924
02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:23.500 line:82%
Why should I?
I don't want to see that.

1925
02:08:23.583 --> 02:08:27.292 line:82%
- Look at my tie.
- You were saying this, I thought--

1926
02:08:27.375 --> 02:08:29.119 line:82%
Naina has given me this tie.

1927
02:08:29.833 --> 02:08:31.539 line:82%
And a lovely love letter.

1928
02:08:37.333 --> 02:08:38.750 line:82%
If it wasn't for you,
there would be nothing.

1929
02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:44.792 line:82%
You should write a book!

1930
02:08:44.958 --> 02:08:46.417 line:82%
Six days and you get the girl.

1931
02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:47.583 line:82%
I was thinking that too.

1932
02:08:47.792 --> 02:08:50.208 line:82%
Anyway, whatever I did for you is fine.

1933
02:08:50.292 --> 02:08:52.708 line:82%
But even you are quite lucky.
Because for you, I--

1934
02:08:54.542 --> 02:08:56.958 line:82%
What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

1935
02:08:57.042 --> 02:09:01.219 line:82%
It's all you,
it's because of you and your love.

1936
02:09:03.958 --> 02:09:07.583 line:82%
You are so great!
You don't even want to take the credit.

1937
02:09:12.375 --> 02:09:14.625 line:82%
The truth is that it's because
of you Naina is in my heart,

1938
02:09:14.833 --> 02:09:16.458 line:82%
in my heartbeat, in every breath--

1939
02:09:16.542 --> 02:09:18.625 line:82%
- And in my room.
- And in my room!

1940
02:09:44.667 --> 02:09:46.125 line:82%
Must have been fun, right?

1941
02:09:46.208 --> 02:09:48.083 line:82%
Must have been great fun
breaking my heart.

1942
02:09:48.833 --> 02:09:50.667 line:82%
Six days and you get the girl!

1943
02:09:51.375 --> 02:09:53.868 line:82%
Both of you should be given an award!
Fantastic, Rohit.

1944
02:09:54.649 --> 02:09:57.222 line:82%
- Listen, Please listen to me.
- No you listen to me.

1945
02:09:57.833 --> 02:10:00.639 line:82%
I thought of you as a friend
and poured my heart out to you.

1946
02:10:00.917 --> 02:10:03.299 line:82%
And what did you do?
You told him everything!

1947
02:10:03.792 --> 02:10:06.458 line:82%
And he wants to play God to everyone,

1948
02:10:06.708 --> 02:10:09.227 line:82%
and he decided that
since he couldn't love me,

1949
02:10:09.310 --> 02:10:11.083 line:82%
he would find love for me!

1950
02:10:12.333 --> 02:10:14.042 line:82%
So he knocked on your door!

1951
02:10:14.167 --> 02:10:16.917 line:82%
And told you that your friendship is
not just friendship, it's love!

1952
02:10:17.083 --> 02:10:19.708 line:82%
And you got convinced?
Rohit, what kind of a person are you?

1953
02:10:19.958 --> 02:10:22.917 line:82%
Who doesn't know his own heart or
understand his own feelings?

1954
02:10:23.042 --> 02:10:24.917 line:82%
I love you Naina, and that's the truth!

1955
02:10:25.125 --> 02:10:26.417 line:82%
No, that's not true!

1956
02:10:26.667 --> 02:10:31.292 line:82%
The truth is, you have broken my heart!
You have hurt me.

1957
02:10:32.708 --> 02:10:35.917 line:82%
I know that I didn't have
laughter in my life before,

1958
02:10:36.458 --> 02:10:38.375 line:82%
didn't have happiness,
but at least I had a friend!

1959
02:10:39.333 --> 02:10:41.500 line:82%
But today you have
taken that away from me too.

1960
02:10:42.333 --> 02:10:43.500 line:82%
Both of you did.

1961
02:10:44.942 --> 02:10:47.582 line:82%
- Just listen to me.
- No!

1962
02:10:52.833 --> 02:10:54.250 line:82%
No! I don't want to hear anything.

1963
02:10:54.750 --> 02:10:56.083 line:82%
I don't want to understand anything.

1964
02:10:56.250 --> 02:10:58.500 line:82%
For God's sake, just leave me alone!

1965
02:11:04.083 --> 02:11:05.125 line:82%
Wait a second!

1966
02:11:05.643 --> 02:11:09.701 line:82%
Naina, I wish I could tell you
how much I love you.

1967
02:11:09.802 --> 02:11:15.648 line:82%
One second. Wait. I love you.
I love you very very much, Naina.

1968
02:11:20.167 --> 02:11:23.417 line:82%
And then it says, I love you.

1969
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.750 line:82%
And when I close my eyes I see you,

1970
02:11:32.167 --> 02:11:35.083 line:82%
when I open my eyes, I long to see you.

1971
02:11:37.125 --> 02:11:39.708 line:82%
Even when you are not near me,
I feel you in everything.

1972
02:11:39.792 --> 02:11:42.458 line:82%
Every second, every minute, all the time.

1973
02:11:45.167 --> 02:11:48.250 line:82%
My eyes search for my Naina.

1974
02:11:49.833 --> 02:11:53.859 line:82%
Call it love, madness,
or just my heartbeat,

1975
02:11:54.917 --> 02:11:56.333 line:82%
it's the same thing for me.

1976
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.759 line:82%
A lot of people have loved before,

1977
02:12:01.333 --> 02:12:04.459 line:82%
but my love stands apart
from all of them because--

1978
02:12:04.792 --> 02:12:05.875 line:82%
they don't have you.

1979
02:12:09.792 --> 02:12:11.417 line:82%
I can never forget you, Naina.

1980
02:12:11.833 --> 02:12:14.859 line:82%
I don't want to forget you.

1981
02:12:15.667 --> 02:12:19.339 line:82%
You are mine and I will love you forever.

1982
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:23.279 line:82%
I will love you till I die
and even after that!

1983
02:12:26.833 --> 02:12:28.667 line:82%
Really...

1984
02:12:32.833 --> 02:12:38.792 line:82%
All of this is written in Rohit's diary.

1985
02:12:39.708 --> 02:12:41.167 line:82%
How can he hurt--

1986
02:12:42.625 --> 02:12:45.042 line:82%
And you have such a bad handwriting.

1987
02:13:15.208 --> 02:13:17.208 line:82%
Aman, all this? I didn't--

1988
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:19.083 line:82%
You didn't write it, but I said it.

1989
02:13:21.083 --> 02:13:22.542 line:82%
If you had to write it,
you would write the same thing isn't it?

1990
02:13:22.667 --> 02:13:24.875 line:82%
So I said what was in your heart.
What's the big deal?

1991
02:13:26.083 --> 02:13:29.750 line:82%
And girls like all this,
I have done it a lot.

1992
02:14:00.838 --> 02:14:01.929 line:82%
Naina!

1993
02:14:03.170 --> 02:14:05.500 line:82%
Sorry, Mom. It's late, let's go.

1994
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:10.519 line:82%
I want to say something to you.
Just listen to me.

1995
02:14:15.333 --> 02:14:19.459 line:82%
Naina, to sustain life long relationships,

1996
02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:24.019 line:82%
every relationship has to
have strength along with love.

1997
02:14:26.583 --> 02:14:28.679 line:82%
Your Dad loved us a lot,

1998
02:14:30.542 --> 02:14:31.833 line:82%
but he was a weak man.

1999
02:14:33.958 --> 02:14:35.319 line:82%
He left us all and went away.

2000
02:14:37.125 --> 02:14:38.499 line:82%
He didn't even for a moment think,

2001
02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:42.099 line:82%
what would become of us after him.

2002
02:14:45.333 --> 02:14:50.119 line:82%
But Rohit, Rohit is not weak.

2003
02:14:50.833 --> 02:14:52.419 line:82%
He loves you a lot.

2004
02:14:55.125 --> 02:14:57.759 line:82%
It's so easy to say that Dad was weak.

2005
02:14:59.285 --> 02:15:04.375 line:82%
And Rohit taking someone else's help
to attain your love,

2006
02:15:04.458 --> 02:15:07.625 line:82%
isn't that a sign of weakness?
Tell me Mom--

2007
02:15:10.875 --> 02:15:12.750 line:82%
To attain his love he sought help,

2008
02:15:13.458 --> 02:15:15.000 line:82%
what's wrong with that?

2009
02:15:17.125 --> 02:15:18.208 line:82%
Look, Naina,

2010
02:15:19.292 --> 02:15:23.417 line:82%
I will still say Rohit is not a weak.

2011
02:15:25.625 --> 02:15:30.917 line:82%
He knows you love someone else
and yet he is willing to accept you.

2012
02:15:32.708 --> 02:15:36.875 line:82%
That's strength, my child. That's love.

2013
02:15:40.417 --> 02:15:46.000 line:82%
If you reject his love today,
it will be a girl's decision

2014
02:15:50.292 --> 02:15:56.460 line:82%
and tomorrow when you repent it,
it will be a woman's regret!

2015
02:15:56.571 --> 02:15:57.588 line:82%
Mom!

2016
02:16:07.652 --> 02:16:09.365 line:82%
- Hello.
- Hi, Rohit.

2017
02:16:10.136 --> 02:16:11.958 line:82%
- Naina!
- Where are you?

2018
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:15.083 line:82%
In the office.

2019
02:16:15.375 --> 02:16:16.428 line:82%
I wanted to speak to you.

2020
02:16:16.829 --> 02:16:19.012 line:82%
Actually, It's kind of private.

2021
02:16:19.625 --> 02:16:22.542 line:82%
Private and confidential? J. Kapur?

2022
02:16:23.307 --> 02:16:26.399 line:82%
Oh my god. It's Frankie's letter. Didi!

2023
02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:29.492 line:82%
Didi! Guess what?

2024
02:16:29.583 --> 02:16:34.198 line:82%
- What happened?
- Congratulations! Fantastic

2025
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.292 line:82%
But how did you know?
I haven't even opened it.

2026
02:16:37.458 --> 02:16:38.833 line:82%
- What did you not open?
- Don't even open it.

2027
02:16:39.083 --> 02:16:40.667 line:82%
- Aman will run away.
- No, I won't.

2028
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:44.458 line:82%
- It's Frankie's letter!
- Yes, yes.

2029
02:16:45.958 --> 02:16:48.267 line:82%
- What happened?
- Naina wants to meet Rohit.

2030
02:16:48.727 --> 02:16:50.576 line:82%
FinaIIy and they're going for
the first meeting.

2031
02:16:52.583 --> 02:16:54.212 line:82%
And Frankie's sent a letter.

2032
02:16:54.323 --> 02:16:57.362 line:82%
Yes that's fantastic news.

2033
02:16:57.458 --> 02:17:00.428 line:82%
I'm going to get her ready myself.
I've got the perfect white dress.

2034
02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:01.917 line:82%
And do you know what?

2035
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.803 line:82%
- Yes, Frankie has sent a letter!
- Yes, Frankie has sent a letter!

2036
02:17:04.044 --> 02:17:06.087 line:82%
And now we'II go... & eat something.

2037
02:17:06.167 --> 02:17:08.547 line:82%
But how did that happen?
I'm just a sexy genius.

2038
02:17:15.250 --> 02:17:16.511 line:82%
- It's Frankie's letter.
- It's mine!

2039
02:17:16.582 --> 02:17:17.772 line:82%
- Letter is mine give it to me.
- One minute.

2040
02:17:18.542 --> 02:17:19.875 line:82%
Let me see, what he has written.

2041
02:17:27.125 --> 02:17:30.667 line:82%
It's not Frankie's letter.

2042
02:17:46.083 --> 02:17:47.833 line:82%
She's looking so pretty!

2043
02:17:47.917 --> 02:17:51.500 line:82%
Just pull this up a bit.
Lord protect you from evil eye!

2044
02:17:52.333 --> 02:17:55.080 line:82%
Enough, may I leave?

2045
02:17:58.692 --> 02:18:01.472 line:82%
Naina, you...

2046
02:18:01.942 --> 02:18:03.791 line:82%
I like her hair down.

2047
02:18:06.833 --> 02:18:07.958 line:82%
Your hair...

2048
02:18:20.833 --> 02:18:22.208 line:82%
...look better, when they are down.

2049
02:18:25.625 --> 02:18:26.625 line:82%
Go.

2050
02:19:09.167 --> 02:19:10.917 line:82%
- Rohit, all this--
- Please!

2051
02:19:15.125 --> 02:19:18.042 line:82%
I know you don't have love for me today,

2052
02:19:19.292 --> 02:19:24.119 line:82%
But I'm sure someday you will.
I'm sure!

2053
02:19:25.458 --> 02:19:27.339 line:82%
And I will wait for that day,

2054
02:19:28.125 --> 02:19:31.019 line:82%
because I know that day
will definitely come.

2055
02:19:32.250 --> 02:19:35.799 line:82%
But for today, have faith in my love.

2056
02:19:37.458 --> 02:19:39.819 line:82%
Because I know it's enough for both of us.

2057
02:19:40.750 --> 02:19:42.333 line:82%
I know it's enough.

2058
02:19:45.125 --> 02:19:49.559 line:82%
I wanted to give these flowers
to you once before, but I couldn't.

2059
02:19:50.958 --> 02:19:54.700 line:82%
Don't reject them today...
They will wilt.

2060
02:19:58.167 --> 02:20:04.192 line:82%
Naina, Marry me!

2061
02:20:30.584 --> 02:20:32.492 line:82%
Hello! Yeah! Ya!

2062
02:20:44.709 --> 02:20:45.784 line:82%
She said yes.

2063
02:20:59.272 --> 02:21:02.350 line:82%
Everybody... I need a hug
come on everybody.

2064
02:21:39.458 --> 02:21:41.978 line:82%
The next step was to convince
Karsanbhai and Sarlaben,

2065
02:21:43.625 --> 02:21:45.246 line:82%
which wasn't very difficult.

2066
02:21:46.447 --> 02:21:49.848 line:82%
- After all.
- It's just geography!

2067
02:21:50.125 --> 02:21:51.858 line:82%
Come, come, Julieben!

2068
02:21:52.942 --> 02:21:55.307 line:82%
- Jennifer.
- Who is Jennifer?

2069
02:21:56.868 --> 02:21:57.933 line:82%
It's alright.

2070
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.167 line:82%
- Why don't you have something?
- Yes, sure.

2071
02:22:01.375 --> 02:22:02.917 line:82%
Just pass me the cock.

2072
02:22:04.083 --> 02:22:06.000 line:82%
Yes, yes. Coke.

2073
02:22:06.375 --> 02:22:08.208 line:82%
So everything is fixed!

2074
02:22:08.542 --> 02:22:12.375 line:82%
Engagement and our wedding anniversary
will be on the same day.

2075
02:22:12.792 --> 02:22:15.083 line:82%
And two days later will be the wedding,
is it alright?

2076
02:22:15.375 --> 02:22:16.375 line:82%
As you say!

2077
02:22:17.958 --> 02:22:20.000 line:82%
As you wish.

2078
02:22:20.125 --> 02:22:24.280 line:82%
- And the funny thing, Jamnaben is...
- Jenniferben.

2079
02:22:24.583 --> 02:22:26.875 line:82%
There's this famous decorator from Paris,

2080
02:22:27.167 --> 02:22:32.046 line:82%
who is coming and at the same time,
he will decorate my hole.

2081
02:22:32.437 --> 02:22:34.506 line:82%
No... I have a very big hoIe! Isn't it?

2082
02:22:34.747 --> 02:22:36.575 line:82%
-Very big...
- Hall.

2083
02:22:37.875 --> 02:22:42.000 line:82%
Look, Patelji, I leave all the details of
the wedding up to you.

2084
02:22:43.333 --> 02:22:46.708 line:82%
I am just happy
that we got such a good boy.

2085
02:22:49.042 --> 02:22:51.833 line:82%
I just miss my son.

2086
02:22:53.182 --> 02:22:55.402 line:82%
Very sad. Rohit told us.

2087
02:22:57.093 --> 02:22:58.578 line:82%
- What happened?
- Heart attack.

2088
02:22:59.689 --> 02:23:02.283 line:82%
Oh, Heart attack.

2089
02:23:03.333 --> 02:23:04.958 line:82%
Just waiting for
Naina and Shiv to settle down,

2090
02:23:05.458 --> 02:23:07.458 line:82%
then I can peacefully leave
for Chandigarh!

2091
02:23:07.708 --> 02:23:08.833 line:82%
And what about Gia?

2092
02:23:08.958 --> 02:23:10.125 line:82%
- She is not--
- Grandmother!

2093
02:23:11.208 --> 02:23:15.083 line:82%
No, no, Gia is as much ours as Naina is.

2094
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:18.958 line:82%
And...

2095
02:23:20.625 --> 02:23:23.417 line:82%
My husband didn't die of a heart attack,

2096
02:23:24.875 --> 02:23:26.250 line:82%
he committed suicide.

2097
02:23:43.708 --> 02:23:45.542 line:82%
Why did you have to tell them the truth?

2098
02:23:46.083 --> 02:23:48.625 line:82%
New relationships cannot be built on lies.

2099
02:23:48.709 --> 02:23:50.267 line:82%
When you couldn't handle
old relationships,

2100
02:23:50.333 --> 02:23:51.583 line:82%
how will you handle new ones?

2101
02:23:51.667 --> 02:23:53.708 line:82%
Relationships are not handled,
they are maintained!

2102
02:23:53.785 --> 02:23:55.334 line:82%
But what would you know about them?

2103
02:23:55.417 --> 02:23:56.417 line:82%
Listen!

2104
02:23:57.042 --> 02:24:00.542 line:82%
I will only be your daughter-in-law
when Gia is your granddaughter.

2105
02:24:00.708 --> 02:24:03.667 line:82%
Gia was not my grand daughter
and she will never be!

2106
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:04.750 line:82%
Blood is blood after all!

2107
02:24:04.833 --> 02:24:07.598 line:82%
That's it! I don't want to hear anymore!

2108
02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:10.417 line:82%
Why? When you are so fond
of saying the truth

2109
02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:14.292 line:82%
learn to listen to it too.
Gia is not my granddaughter.

2110
02:24:15.542 --> 02:24:19.583 line:82%
She is not a part of this family.
She is just a burden.

2111
02:24:19.667 --> 02:24:23.583 line:82%
A burden which you thrust
on this family by adopting her.

2112
02:24:25.125 --> 02:24:29.167 line:82%
A burden which took away
all the happiness in the family,

2113
02:24:29.292 --> 02:24:32.417 line:82%
took away peace, took away my son!

2114
02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:38.583 line:82%
I hate her, I hate that nasty little--

2115
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:39.750 line:82%
No!

2116
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:54.542 line:82%
We are still paying for my son's mistakes.

2117
02:24:54.792 --> 02:24:56.667 line:82%
His first mistake was marrying you.

2118
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:58.375 line:82%
The second was adopting that girl.

2119
02:24:58.458 --> 02:24:59.583 line:82%
He made one more mistake.

2120
02:24:59.833 --> 02:25:03.375 line:82%
You? Who the hell are you
to interfere in our family matters?

2121
02:25:03.708 --> 02:25:08.498 line:82%
No one, just a voice that should
have reached you a long time ago.

2122
02:25:09.792 --> 02:25:13.098 line:82%
A truth that you should have
realized long ago.

2123
02:25:13.662 --> 02:25:15.738 line:82%
PIease Jenny, Let me say it.

2124
02:25:18.042 --> 02:25:20.833 line:82%
Since you are harping on the truth,
I would like to tell you a truth too.

2125
02:25:21.417 --> 02:25:24.958 line:82%
About your son's illicit relationship,

2126
02:25:27.250 --> 02:25:28.917 line:82%
which he hid from all of you,

2127
02:25:29.708 --> 02:25:31.538 line:82%
but he couldn't hide its result.

2128
02:25:32.250 --> 02:25:33.708 line:82%
Do you know the name of the result?

2129
02:25:39.167 --> 02:25:40.667 line:82%
The result was Gia...

2130
02:25:44.625 --> 02:25:46.208 line:82%
who was not accepted by her own mother,

2131
02:25:46.917 --> 02:25:49.833 line:82%
but was accepted
by your daughter-in-law, Jenny.

2132
02:25:51.792 --> 02:25:54.625 line:82%
She was brought into this house
by your daughter-in-law, Jenny.

2133
02:25:55.958 --> 02:25:59.158 line:82%
Jenny, who could have seen the face
of the other woman in Gia's face,

2134
02:26:00.208 --> 02:26:03.058 line:82%
who could have seen her husband's mistakes
in that face,

2135
02:26:03.708 --> 02:26:06.478 line:82%
but what she chose to see
were those incomplete eyes.

2136
02:26:08.458 --> 02:26:10.375 line:82%
And she chose to complete those
eyes by filling them with love.

2137
02:26:11.758 --> 02:26:13.258 line:82%
That's your daughter-in-law, Jenny.

2138
02:26:25.125 --> 02:26:27.875 line:82%
Your son would have understood
her hurt and her anger,

2139
02:26:28.833 --> 02:26:31.042 line:82%
but he couldn't understand her love.

2140
02:26:31.625 --> 02:26:35.238 line:82%
Jenny's strength
kept reminding him of his own weakness

2141
02:26:36.958 --> 02:26:41.518 line:82%
and that feeling took his life.
Not Gia.

2142
02:26:48.375 --> 02:26:49.458 line:82%
Dear Jennifer,

2143
02:26:50.292 --> 02:26:54.625 line:82%
I know in these last six years
I have only enquired about Gia,

2144
02:26:55.417 --> 02:26:57.042 line:82%
never about you.

2145
02:26:57.958 --> 02:27:01.208 line:82%
But today, in this last letter,

2146
02:27:02.208 --> 02:27:08.065 line:82%
I just want to thank you.
Thank You Jennifer. Thank You!

2147
02:27:08.958 --> 02:27:12.792 line:82%
Women are built to forgive the
mistakes that their husbands make

2148
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:19.083 line:82%
but very few women have the courage
to accept the mistake

2149
02:27:19.958 --> 02:27:23.500 line:82%
and shower love to such a degree
that it doesn't remain a mistake.

2150
02:27:24.250 --> 02:27:29.958 line:82%
You accepted Gia when I, her mother,
couldn't accept her.

2151
02:27:30.667 --> 02:27:32.875 line:82%
And for this I will always
remain indebted to you.

2152
02:27:34.042 --> 02:27:36.208 line:82%
They say that when
a man makes a mistake,

2153
02:27:36.875 --> 02:27:39.958 line:82%
he also possesses the ability
to pay the price for it.

2154
02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:45.792 line:82%
But Jennifer, all these years you have
paid a price for a mistake,

2155
02:27:46.333 --> 02:27:47.833 line:82%
that was not yours.

2156
02:27:48.708 --> 02:27:50.167 line:82%
And all that because of me.

2157
02:27:51.292 --> 02:27:52.911 line:82%
lf you can, please forgive me.

2158
02:27:54.352 --> 02:27:57.410 line:82%
l'm sorry Jennifer.
l'm really sorry

2159
02:27:58.625 --> 02:28:00.250 line:82%
I caused you a lot of pain.

2160
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:17.542 line:82%
He was a good man!

2161
02:28:19.542 --> 02:28:22.218 line:82%
It was just a mistake!

2162
02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.375 line:82%
- Just a mistake!
- Yes, child, yes.

2163
02:28:31.115 --> 02:28:36.917 line:82%
He was a good man!
He was a good man.

2164
02:28:52.917 --> 02:28:57.500 line:82%
And finally,
Gia's perfect family was complete.

2165
02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:01.292 line:82%
All the distances were bridged,

2166
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:05.000 line:82%
and we started praying together.

2167
02:29:05.084 --> 02:29:08.090 line:82%
Like one big happy family.

2168
02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:11.458 line:82%
The engagement preparations
had begun in full swing.

2169
02:29:12.458 --> 02:29:16.000 line:82%
Jean De Bon, the famous decorator
from France had arrived,

2170
02:29:16.667 --> 02:29:19.250 line:82%
to do up the Patel Mansion.

2171
02:29:19.804 --> 02:29:22.940 line:82%
- Drapes.
- From the top.

2172
02:29:23.250 --> 02:29:28.208 line:82%
- Leaving all the love of my family.
- Leaving all the love of my family.

2173
02:29:28.292 --> 02:29:32.875 line:82%
- I have to go to my beloved's land.
- I have to go to my beloved's land.

2174
02:29:33.833 --> 02:29:37.042 line:82%
And in Aman's mansion, there was chaos.

2175
02:29:37.708 --> 02:29:39.458 line:82%
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God!

2176
02:29:39.667 --> 02:29:44.667 line:82%
God had heard Kantaben's prayers,
Rohit was getting married to a girl.

2177
02:29:48.333 --> 02:29:49.917 line:82%
Finally, the day of the engagement.

2178
02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:58.384 line:82%

2287
02:42:20.833 --> 02:42:24.042 line:82%
Really, Priya, when I see Aman today,

2288
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:29.679 line:82%
I can't believe that...
Aman doesn't have much time left.

2289
02:42:32.770 --> 02:42:35.659 line:82%
But it's reaIIy nice to know that
you guys are with him.

2290
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:36.808 line:82%
In his Iast days.

2291
02:42:43.417 --> 02:42:45.250 line:82%
Aman doesn't have much time.

2292
02:42:46.958 --> 02:42:49.000 line:82%
Aman doesn't have much time.

2293
02:42:50.792 --> 02:42:54.625 line:82%
Listen, live, laugh, smile.
Who knows? Tomorrow may not come.

2294
02:42:57.458 --> 02:42:58.500 line:82%
Priya is my wife.

2295
02:43:07.292 --> 02:43:09.167 line:82%
I will love you forever.

2296
02:43:09.542 --> 02:43:13.250 line:82%
I will love you till the day I die
and even after that!

2297
02:43:50.125 --> 02:43:52.917 line:82%
Aman, what are you doing?

2298
02:43:53.583 --> 02:43:55.625 line:82%
Mom, I have to go.
Please!

2299
02:44:43.002 --> 02:44:45.250 line:82%
I Iove you. I Iove you
very very much.

2300
02:45:26.646 --> 02:45:27.833 line:82%
You lied.

2301
02:45:30.125 --> 02:45:33.333 line:82%
You love Naina, you lied!

2302
02:45:34.625 --> 02:45:36.167 line:82%
I don't love Naina.

2303
02:45:36.708 --> 02:45:38.495 line:82%
Don't do that!

2304
02:45:39.833 --> 02:45:41.917 line:82%
Doing that doesn't change the truth, Aman.

2305
02:45:42.167 --> 02:45:44.583 line:82%
Naina loves you, you love Naina!

2306
02:45:44.917 --> 02:45:46.750 line:82%
How did I become a part
of this love story?

2307
02:45:46.833 --> 02:45:48.792 line:82%
Love stories are made with two hearts,
Rohit.

2308
02:45:50.375 --> 02:45:53.083 line:82%
And in a few months my heart
won't exist in the love story.

2309
02:45:54.375 --> 02:45:56.042 line:82%
I will just be a memory.

2310
02:45:56.583 --> 02:45:57.708 line:82%
You are the reality, Rohit.

2311
02:45:57.833 --> 02:45:59.958 line:82%
I can face reality, Aman.

2312
02:46:00.333 --> 02:46:01.875 line:82%
But I don't have the strength
to fight a memory, Aman.

2313
02:46:01.958 --> 02:46:04.125 line:82%
You don't have the strength?
How can you say that?

2314
02:46:06.042 --> 02:46:09.167 line:82%
It means you don't love Naina
as much as I thought you did.

2315
02:46:09.625 --> 02:46:11.125 line:82%
Say you don't know how to love!

2316
02:46:11.208 --> 02:46:13.542 line:82%
What do you know?
What do you know about my love?

2317
02:46:14.375 --> 02:46:15.750 line:82%
You know nothing!

2318
02:46:16.042 --> 02:46:18.875 line:82%
Naina is my life,
my everything, my love...

2319
02:46:18.958 --> 02:46:21.750 line:82%
...And you will let go of your life
so easily?

2320
02:46:22.667 --> 02:46:24.250 line:82%
Why don't you understand, Rohit?

2321
02:46:24.833 --> 02:46:26.542 line:82%
Naina will get me only to lose me,

2322
02:46:26.625 --> 02:46:28.167 line:82%
but what will she gain, if she loses you?

2323
02:46:28.708 --> 02:46:30.542 line:82%
Neither love nor a great friendship!

2324
02:46:30.792 --> 02:46:34.818 line:82%
Her love is yours. It belongs to you!

2325
02:46:36.167 --> 02:46:40.917 line:82%
It just needs time, and that's what
I don't have. I don't have time.

2326
02:46:43.333 --> 02:46:46.208 line:82%
Naina belongs to you, you can't leave her!

2327
02:46:46.292 --> 02:46:48.167 line:82%
If not for you, if not for Naina,

2328
02:46:48.250 --> 02:46:50.000 line:82%
at least do this as a dying man's wish!

2329
02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:52.667 line:82%
Please fulfill my last wish, Rohit.

2330
02:46:52.750 --> 02:46:55.667 line:82%
You can't leave Naina!
That's it!

2331
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:59.625 line:82%
What would you have done
if you were in my place?

2332
02:47:03.792 --> 02:47:07.375 line:82%
I wish I was in your place.

2333
02:47:10.324 --> 02:47:11.417 line:82%
I wish.

2334
02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:43.375 line:82%
Do you love me so much...

2335
02:48:44.625 --> 02:48:50.000 line:82%
...that you want to leave behind
love for meafter you are gone?

2336
02:48:52.958 --> 02:48:54.792 line:82%
Even if it is someone else's?

2337
02:48:55.833 --> 02:48:57.208 line:82%
Why...

2338
02:48:58.250 --> 02:49:04.167 line:82%
...Why do you love me so much?

2339
02:49:05.208 --> 02:49:06.878 line:82%
I don't love you.

2340
02:49:09.218 --> 02:49:11.098 line:82%
I don't love you.

2341
02:49:14.209 --> 02:49:17.878 line:82%
I don't Iove you, Naina...
I don't Iove you

2342
02:49:25.375 --> 02:49:31.333 line:82%
I don't love you.
I don't love anyone.

2343
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:50.618 line:82%

02:58:59.845 --> 02:59:02.899 line:82%
- Lataji!
- Leave it.

2378
02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:13.412 line:82%
Good night, sweetheart!

2379
02:59:13.813 --> 02:59:15.225 line:82%
Thank you, sexy!

2380
03:00:39.833 --> 03:00:42.333 line:82%
You have put on weight after marriage.

2381
03:01:20.094 --> 03:01:23.940 line:82%

I'm sorry...

2383

- I...
- I...

2384
03:01:32.777 --> 03:01:33.932 line:82%
After you.

2385
03:01:35.053 --> 03:01:36.107 line:82%
I think so.

2386
03:01:40.583 --> 03:01:45.158 line:82%
Rohit, Naina is yours in this life.

2387
03:01:48.542 --> 03:01:50.167 line:82%
But in every life after this...

2388
03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:56.134 line:82%
...in every birth, she will be mine.

2389
03:02:01.427 --> 03:02:05.592 line:82%
Promise me... promise me

2390
03:02:08.913 --> 03:02:11.105 line:82%
I promise.

2391
03:02:19.042 --> 03:02:20.051 line:82%
Dog!

2392
03:02:23.032 --> 03:02:24.180 line:82%
I promise you.

2393
03:02:32.125 --> 03:02:33.667 line:82%
I want to sleep now.

2394
03:02:36.208 --> 03:02:39.453 line:82%
Just wake me up before you leave.

2395
03:03:04.250 --> 03:03:06.077 line:82%
Aman! Not yet... idiot!

2396
03:03:42.333 --> 03:03:44.000 line:82%
20 YEARS LATER

2397
03:03:44.125 --> 03:03:48.625 line:82%
And he went away,
leaving all of us behind.

2398
03:03:50.083 --> 03:03:51.618 line:82%
He became a memory...

2399
03:03:53.542 --> 03:03:56.458 line:82%
A memory that is the foundation
of all my relationships.

2400
03:04:00.792 --> 03:04:02.458 line:82%
He was my first love,

2401
03:04:04.333 --> 03:04:07.438 line:82%
and yours too.
Isn't that right, Gia?

2402
03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:13.458 line:82%
I can never forget him.

2403
03:04:14.583 --> 03:04:20.318 line:82%
He taught me to love, to love life,
to love myself...

2404
03:04:21.542 --> 03:04:23.118 line:82%
...to love Rohit.

2405
03:04:24.250 --> 03:04:25.750 line:82%
I can never forget him.

2406
03:04:26.250 --> 03:04:27.268 line:82%
We...

2407
03:04:29.208 --> 03:04:33.163 line:82%
...we can never forget him.

2408
03:04:36.124 --> 03:04:41.334 line:82%
Mom, it's too coId
can we go inside pIease.

2409
03:04:41.432 --> 03:04:44.215 line:82%
- Coming darIing.
- Come on come on.

2410
03:04:44.296 --> 03:04:45.318 line:82%
Wait on Ria.

2411
03:04:49.937 --> 03:04:51.187 line:82%
By the way,

2412
03:04:51.268 --> 03:04:53.173 line:82%
- I haven't said this recently.
-What?

2413
03:04:54.084 --> 03:04:55.148 line:82%
That I Iove you!

2414
03:04:57.750 --> 03:05:01.750 line:82%
Every girl wants to find
a good friend in her husband...

2415
03:05:02.542 --> 03:05:06.375 line:82%
...but I was fortunate to find
a husband in my best friend.

2416
03:05:07.292 --> 03:05:11.083 line:82%
I am Naina Catherine Kapur Patel,

2417
03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.833 line:82%
and this was my story.
