In the '80s, we had the Three Lows.
It was the time of economic boom.

159
00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:49.000 line:82%
Our economy has shown
a remarkable growth this year,

160
00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:52.133 line:82%
but it has also left behind
a new set of problems.

161
00:09:57.166 --> 00:10:00.633 line:82%
In Korea, there are over 400,000
adult entertainment establishments.

162
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.166 line:82%
-How flashy.
-My goodness.

163
00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:06.567 line:82%
The money that's poured
into these establishments

164
00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:09.000 line:82%
is estimated to be over four trillion won.

165
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:10.867 line:82%
It can easily be guessed

166
00:10:10.934 --> 00:10:14.867 line:82%
that such establishments are
only for a certain class of people.

167
00:10:14.934 --> 00:10:16.300 line:82%
Why do you think that happened?

168
00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:18.200 line:82%
-People had too much money.
-Yes.

169
00:10:18.266 --> 00:10:20.066 line:82%
-Suddenly…
-The economy was doing well.

170
00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:22.467 line:82%
Really? Was too much money the problem?

171
00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:25.600 line:82%
The spread of such establishments has led
to an increase in various crimes

172
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.467 line:82%
and deviations.

173
00:10:27.533 --> 00:10:29.767 line:82%
As it leads to horrible crimes,

174
00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:33.000 line:82%
we should look back
on our consumptive behavior.

175
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.233 line:82%
When there's an overflow of money,
industries like that grow.

176
00:10:39.233 --> 00:10:42.533 line:82%
Is there a deeply-rooted gang
in Korea like Al Capone's in Chicago?

177
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.233 line:82%
Here it comes.

178
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.800 line:82%
-Al Capone?
-War on crime.

179
00:10:45.867 --> 00:10:47.200 line:82%
War on crime.

180
00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:50.333 line:82%
According to the police,
there are around 160 gangs

181
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.800 line:82%
and 1,600 gang members in Korea.

182
00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:56.100 line:82%
This must be the theme.

183
00:10:56.166 --> 00:10:58.000 line:82%
Here's Im Chang-geun with the story.

184
00:10:58.066 --> 00:10:59.700 line:82%
Around the entertainment district,

185
00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:03.333 line:82%
gang members extort valuables
from business owners and customers.

186
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.867 line:82%
They come every day

187
00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:08.033 line:82%
and torment me.

188
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.800 line:82%
If I don't give them liquor and money,

189
00:11:09.867 --> 00:11:11.000 line:82%
they beat me up.

190
00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:12.066 line:82%
My goodness.

191
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.300 line:82%
They force me to buy their…

192
00:11:17.367 --> 00:11:19.000 line:82%
What? What did they force him to buy?

193
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.834 line:82%
There are 600 potential offenders,

194
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.033 line:82%
so the police officers keep them in check
every night.

195
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.333 line:82%
…keep them in check every night.

196
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.133 line:82%
They forced him to buy their "blank."

197
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.033 line:82%
Their…

198
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.633 line:82%
Is it liquor?

199
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.367 line:82%
With the economic boom of the '80s,
adult establishments thrived.

200
00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:42.934 line:82%
-
People spent a lot of money.
-
That's right.

201
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.033 line:82%
What's this about?

202
00:11:47.633 --> 00:11:50.800 line:82%
Why are they showing us the news today?

203
00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:52.900 line:82%
Usually, it's a hint.

204
00:11:52.967 --> 00:11:55.166 line:82%
-What could it be? A music cafe--
-Right.

205
00:11:56.066 --> 00:11:57.166 line:82%
A music cafe--

206
00:11:58.133 --> 00:12:00.200 line:82%
-Where is that punk?
-Come on out, you punk!

207
00:12:00.266 --> 00:12:01.467 line:82%
-Where is he?
-Come on out!

208
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.066 line:82%
-Where is that punk?
-Come on out, you punk!

209
00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:07.567 line:82%
That startled me.

210
00:12:07.633 --> 00:12:10.333 line:82%
-Oh, my.
-That startled me.

211
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.900 line:82%
Oh, no.

212
00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:14.667 line:82%
Come on out!

213
00:12:16.467 --> 00:12:18.533 line:82%
Where did you hide him? Isn't he here?

214
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.100 line:82%
Have you seen him?
The punk with slicked-back hair.

215
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.433 line:82%
Have you seen him?
The punk with slicked-back hair.

216
00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:26.333 line:82%
I was so startled.

217
00:12:27.767 --> 00:12:29.166 line:82%
Have you seen him or not?

218
00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:30.934 line:82%
Why haven't you seen him?

219
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.367 line:82%
Come on out!

220
00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:33.467 line:82%
Come on out!

221
00:12:33.967 --> 00:12:35.900 line:82%
-Come on out!
-Oh, no.

222
00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:37.767 line:82%
-Come on out!
-Oh, no.

223
00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:38.967 line:82%
Mister.

224
00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.066 line:82%
-Mister.
-Mister.

225
00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:53.567 line:82%
-A man with mousse in his hair.
-Mousse?

226
00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:56.533 line:82%
-We haven't seen him.
-Are they talking about Woo-il?

227
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.166 line:82%
Perhaps you guys hid him.

228
00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:05.033 line:82%
-We didn't do that.
-Who do you mean?

229
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.467 line:82%
-Unbelievable.
-Mousse?

230
00:13:06.533 --> 00:13:10.200 line:82%
Hey, we know that you're here.

231
00:13:10.266 --> 00:13:12.266 line:82%
-Who are you looking for?
-I'll count to three.

232
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.433 line:82%
One.

233
00:13:14.834 --> 00:13:15.834 line:82%
Two.

234
00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:18.100 line:82%
Three.

235
00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:20.200 line:82%
What?

236
00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:22.934 line:82%
What?

237
00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:32.467 line:82%
Oh, my!

238
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.066 line:82%
Oh, my!

239
00:13:35.834 --> 00:13:37.233 line:82%
Catch him, you idiot!

240
00:13:39.367 --> 00:13:41.567 line:82%
-That startled me.
-He ran away.

241
00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:42.867 line:82%
My goodness.

242
00:13:42.934 --> 00:13:44.433 line:82%
-That startled me.
-He ran away.

243
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.633 line:82%
-My goodness.
-I'm so scared.

244
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.667 line:82%
-That man…
-It was like a movie.

245
00:13:49.734 --> 00:13:50.967 line:82%
Where was that man hiding?

246
00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:53.467 line:82%
What on earth is going on?

247
00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:55.867 line:82%
-This makes no sense.
-I mean…

248
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.166 line:82%
That scared me.

249
00:13:58.233 --> 00:13:59.967 line:82%
The scale got bigger.

250
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.767 line:82%
-This is very embarrassing.
-What?

251
00:14:03.834 --> 00:14:05.900 line:82%
I hid behind JENNIE.

252
00:14:06.433 --> 00:14:09.100 line:82%
-What should I do? I hid behind her.
-Tae-hyun.

253
00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:11.467 line:82%
-Tae-hyun, you deserted JENNIE.
-It's too late.

254
00:14:11.533 --> 00:14:12.533 line:82%
It's too late.

255
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.300 line:82%
JENNIE was suddenly in front of me.

256
00:14:16.767 --> 00:14:20.133 line:82%
-Where is that punk?
-Come on out, you punk!

257
00:14:24.066 --> 00:14:25.734 line:82%
He put me in between. Well done.

258
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800 line:82%
They were swinging wooden planks.

259
00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.367 line:82%
Are they thugs?

260
00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:30.200 line:82%
-I think so.
-What was that about?

261
00:14:30.266 --> 00:14:33.433 line:82%
According to the police,
there are around 160 gangs

262
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.867 line:82%
and 1,600 gang members in Korea.

263
00:14:37.433 --> 00:14:39.100 line:82%
-That startled me.
-That startled me.

264
00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:40.166 line:82%
-Unbelievable.
-So scary.

265
00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:42.867 line:82%
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

266
00:14:42.934 --> 00:14:45.433 line:82%
-I should've known…
-Excuse me.

267
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.734 line:82%
Have you seen this man?

268
00:14:48.734 --> 00:14:50.900 line:82%
-What should I do?
-What's wrong?

269
00:14:50.967 --> 00:14:54.500 line:82%
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

270
00:14:54.567 --> 00:14:57.567 line:82%
He's someone precious to me.

271
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.767 line:82%
-It's that man.
-The man with mousse in his hair.

272
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.600 line:82%
Catch him, you idiot!

273
00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:07.333 line:82%
Have you seen him? Where was he?

274
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.133 line:82%
We've seen him.
He was hiding here, but he ran away.

275
00:15:10.767 --> 00:15:13.633 line:82%
-She's crying for real.
-Please look at this photo.

276
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.400 line:82%
Have you seen this man?

277
00:15:15.467 --> 00:15:17.867 line:82%
Please look at this photo.

278
00:15:17.934 --> 00:15:19.834 line:82%
He's the one who was under the table.

279
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.900 line:82%
My goodness.

280
00:15:20.967 --> 00:15:24.100 line:82%
-He's someone precious to me.
-Really?

281
00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:26.333 line:82%
I really need to find him.

282
00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:31.000 line:82%
Catch him, you idiot!

283
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.533 line:82%
He's someone precious to me.

284
00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:40.400 line:82%
Is he your husband?

285
00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:42.266 line:82%
You're a good actor.

286
00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:44.066 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Do you want to join my agency?

287
00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:47.233 line:82%
-Stop it. She's in character.
-You're a good actor.

288
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.600 line:82%
-She's really good.
-They took him away.

289
00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:52.200 line:82%
Do you know where they took him?

290
00:15:52.266 --> 00:15:54.100 line:82%
-They went that way.
-They went outside.

291
00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:56.100 line:82%
-The men with weapons…
-What should I do?

292
00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:58.100 line:82%
If you find him later on…

293
00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.867 line:82%
I live in unit 407.

294
00:15:59.934 --> 00:16:01.033 line:82%
-Unit 407?
-Unit 407?

295
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.633 line:82%
-Please come to apartment 101, unit 407.
-Okay.

296
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.800 line:82%
-I must find him.
-Unit 407.

297
00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:07.300 line:82%
-I'll remember his face.
-This man…

298
00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:08.667 line:82%
-Okay.
-Thank you.

299
00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.867 line:82%
-Okay. Good luck.
-Thank you.

300
00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:12.734 line:82%
We'll root for you.

301
00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:15.700 line:82%
-She's a great actor.
-She's really good.

302
00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.734 line:82%
-She cried for real.
-She cried for real.

303
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.567 line:82%
Maybe he's her husband in real life.

304
00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:23.700 line:82%
-Her actual husband.
-Her actual husband.

305
00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:24.767 line:82%
-Her husband?
-Yes.

306
00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:27.033 line:82%
This man must be connected
to the mystery item.

307
00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:31.100 line:82%
They force me to buy their…

308
00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:33.133 line:82%
-"Blank."
-He bought "blank."

309
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.133 line:82%
-I suddenly lost my appetite.
-Seriously.

310
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.767 line:82%
We can't eat comfortably.

311
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.667 line:82%
-I know.
-If it's going to be like this,

312
00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:46.500 line:82%
we should always check the surroundings
when we enter a place.

313
00:16:46.567 --> 00:16:48.500 line:82%
-I was so startled.
-I was so startled.

314
00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:50.300 line:82%
How long was he in there?

315
00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:52.066 line:82%
I nearly fainted.

316
00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:55.333 line:82%
Is that woman looking for
the man we just met?

317
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.500 line:82%
Is he her husband?

318
00:16:57.567 --> 00:16:58.934 line:82%
She didn't say.

319
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.800 line:82%
She called him someone precious.

320
00:17:00.867 --> 00:17:03.166 line:82%
-I think we need to find him.
-Is that it?

321
00:17:03.233 --> 00:17:04.633 line:82%
It was unit 407, right?

322
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.633 line:82%
-Unit 407.
-Apartment 101, unit 407.

323
00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:09.633 line:82%
When the thugs entered, I got so startled.

324
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.934 line:82%
JENNIE, I'm sorry about hiding behind you.

325
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.166 line:82%
So what exactly is happening today?

326
00:17:17.233 --> 00:17:18.200 line:82%
What's going on?

327
00:17:18.266 --> 00:17:20.633 line:82%
Are we supposed to find
the man who's precious to her?

328
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.533 line:82%
Once we go to the apartment,
we should check out her unit.

329
00:17:25.233 --> 00:17:27.834 line:82%
-Please come to apartment 101, unit 407.
-Okay.

330
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.000 line:82%
I must find him. Please.

331
00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:34.300 line:82%
-What was it? Unit 407?
-Apartment 104, unit 407?

332
00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:35.533 line:82%
-Unit 407.
-Right?

333
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.500 line:82%
-Apartment 101, unit 407.
-I see.

334
00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:39.066 line:82%
-Where's apartment 104?
-Gosh.

335
00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:40.900 line:82%
-Is that your apartment?
-No.

336
00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:42.934 line:82%
Apartment 101, unit 407.
Are we going there?

337
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.266 line:82%
Jung-ha is talking about the spy again.

338
00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:46.367 line:82%
Again?

339
00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:49.867 line:82%
-JENNIE, Jung-ha thinks it's you today.
-Me?

340
00:17:49.934 --> 00:17:51.233 line:82%
-No.
-I see.

341
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.400 line:82%
She has never done it.
She has never been a spy.

342
00:17:54.467 --> 00:17:55.467 line:82%
-JENNIE?
-Yes.

343
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.333 line:82%
-Please suspect me.
-No.

344
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.066 line:82%
Hey, look at him.

345
00:18:00.133 --> 00:18:02.266 line:82%
-He's going alone.
-He's nervous.

346
00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:04.000 line:82%
-He's going alone.
-Is it you?

347
00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:05.734 line:82%
-Is it you?
-Jae-seok.

348
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.734 line:82%
Seriously. Doesn't he stand out too much?

349
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.734 line:82%
-I just had that thought.
-What's this?

350
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.133 line:82%
-I'll go here.
-"Why am I dressed like this?"

351
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.667 line:82%
Na-ra asked me,

352
00:18:16.734 --> 00:18:19.400 line:82%
"Jae-seok, are you the Grim Reaper?"

353
00:18:19.467 --> 00:18:22.400 line:82%
He thinks he's Lee Dong-wook
in
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God
.

354
00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:24.166 line:82%
Lee Dong-wook.

355
00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:27.367 line:82%
You look like the Grim Reaper
from the back.

356
00:18:27.433 --> 00:18:30.633 line:82%
-The Grim Reaper is wandering the earth.
-You know,

357
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.266 line:82%
I did wonder why
I was the only one dressed this way.

358
00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:37.333 line:82%
You don't know the reason.

359
00:18:38.133 --> 00:18:39.967 line:82%
Why am I the only one dressed this way?

360
00:18:40.533 --> 00:18:42.633 line:82%
Apartment 101, unit 407, reply.

361
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.800 line:82%
Apartment 101.

362
00:18:43.867 --> 00:18:45.567 line:82%
-All right.
-Isn't that it?

363
00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:47.100 line:82%
Those icicles look cool.

364
00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:49.066 line:82%
Isn't the atmosphere eerie?

365
00:18:49.133 --> 00:18:51.233 line:82%
It's like the calm before the storm.

366
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.934 line:82%
That's apartment 101.

367
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.700 line:82%
The apartment…

368
00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:57.066 line:82%
-Gosh, it's that man!
-It's that man.

369
00:18:57.133 --> 00:18:59.066 line:82%
The apartment…

370
00:18:59.133 --> 00:19:02.233 line:82%
-Gosh, it's that man!
-It's that man.

371
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.900 line:82%
-Stop right there!
-It's that man!

372
00:19:03.967 --> 00:19:05.967 line:82%
-Stop right there!
-Should we catch him?

373
00:19:06.033 --> 00:19:07.333 line:82%
Should we catch him?

374
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.700 line:82%
-It's money.
-Money.

375
00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:10.166 line:82%
Should we catch him?

376
00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.533 line:82%
-It's money.
-Money.

377
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.800 line:82%
It's money.

378
00:19:14.734 --> 00:19:15.967 line:82%
Come here.

379
00:19:16.767 --> 00:19:19.033 line:82%
Come here.

380
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.500 line:82%
My goodness.

381
00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:27.567 line:82%
My goodness.

382
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.767 line:82%
Oh, no.

383
00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:34.166 line:82%
Get up. Come here.

384
00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:36.033 line:82%
-He hit him for real.
-I know.

385
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.400 line:82%
-He can fight well.
-He can fight well.

386
00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:41.767 line:82%
Who is he?

387
00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:46.967 line:82%
What happened?

388
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.767 line:82%
-He hit him so hard.
-My goodness.

389
00:19:50.834 --> 00:19:52.900 line:82%
-How dare you run away?
-My goodness.

390
00:19:55.734 --> 00:19:57.867 line:82%
-That must hurt.
-Gosh.

391
00:19:57.934 --> 00:19:59.367 line:82%
Shouldn't we help him?

392
00:19:59.433 --> 00:20:04.400 line:82%
Love isn't a sin!

393
00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:06.266 line:82%
It's a sin, you punk!

394
00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:07.567 line:82%
-What?
-What did he say?

395
00:20:07.633 --> 00:20:09.633 line:82%
-"Love isn't a sin."
-Love?

396
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.066 line:82%
-There you go.
-A flying kick.

397
00:20:15.266 --> 00:20:17.200 line:82%
Love isn't a sin.

398
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.266 line:82%
-If it's about love, what's that money?
-Why is he running away with money?

399
00:20:21.934 --> 00:20:22.934 line:82%
My goodness.

400
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.500 line:82%
Run after him!

401
00:20:25.066 --> 00:20:26.867 line:82%
Catch him!

402
00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:36.066 line:82%
-Let's take the rest of the money.
-Money.

403
00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:37.333 line:82%
-Let's do it.
-Now.

404
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.433 line:82%
Why are you picking up money?

405
00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:42.333 line:82%
-We don't even know what it is.
-What's this?

406
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.767 line:82%
-Let's take it for now.
-There is so much.

407
00:20:44.834 --> 00:20:47.100 line:82%
These are old 10,000-won bills.

408
00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:49.233 line:82%
Who is that man?

409
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.934 line:82%
He said, "Love isn't a sin."
It must be about that woman.

410
00:20:54.967 --> 00:20:57.600 line:82%
Love isn't a sin!

411
00:20:57.667 --> 00:20:59.433 line:82%
It's a sin, you punk!

412
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.367 line:82%
He said, "Love isn't a sin."
It must be about that woman.

413
00:21:02.433 --> 00:21:03.867 line:82%
Love isn't a sin.

414
00:21:03.934 --> 00:21:06.333 line:82%
Falling in love quickly is a sin.

415
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.700 line:82%
-You know…
-What could the story be?

416
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.900 line:82%
Old bills were larger in size.

417
00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:15.567 line:82%
-Why are you talking about something else?
-Listen to us.

418
00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:19.500 line:82%
Why do you keep doing that?
You keep talking about something else.

419
00:21:19.567 --> 00:21:22.333 line:82%
-You're suspicious of me.
-What's up with you?

420
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.867 line:82%
-What's going on?
-It's him today.

421
00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:27.633 line:82%
-What's up with you?
-Why do you keep changing the subject?

422
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.367 line:82%
We were deducing.

423
00:21:29.433 --> 00:21:32.233 line:82%
Now, do you receive orders
without your knowledge?

424
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.734 line:82%
-No.
-Is that it?

425
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.133 line:82%
-No.
-All right.

426
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.600 line:82%
-Now…
-Let's believe him.

427
00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:38.400 line:82%
We're just getting started today.

428
00:21:38.467 --> 00:21:40.800 line:82%
-We don't have enough clues yet.
-Right.

429
00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:42.567 line:82%
You need to give it time.

430
00:21:42.633 --> 00:21:44.734 line:82%
He's the Grim Reaper.

431
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.834 line:82%
Shall we put the matter aside for now?

432
00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.433 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

433
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.867 line:82%
Okay. We'll feign ignorance until lunch.

434
00:21:52.934 --> 00:21:54.100 line:82%
All right.

435
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.633 line:82%
What will happen today?

436
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.900 line:82%
-Are you excited?
-Yes, I like this. It's fun.

437
00:21:59.467 --> 00:22:02.166 line:82%
-Let's get things done today.
-Okay.

438
00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:05.367 line:82%
If you find him later on…

439
00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:07.633 line:82%
Please come to unit 407.

440
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.300 line:82%
Is anyone home?

441
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.266 line:82%
It's open.

442
00:22:19.834 --> 00:22:22.233 line:82%
This is the unit
the woman asked us to visit.

443
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.300 line:82%
There will be clues inside, right?

444
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.633 line:82%
-It's so cold outside.
-It's warm.

445
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.166 line:82%
-It's nice.
-Shall we find the hints first?

446
00:22:30.233 --> 00:22:31.500 line:82%
Let's see.

447
00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:38.133 line:82%
This apartment is feminine.

448
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.233 line:82%
My goodness.

449
00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:42.700 line:82%
This place is so cute.

450
00:22:56.767 --> 00:22:59.467 line:82%
Gosh, this place is clean.

451
00:22:59.533 --> 00:23:01.467 line:82%
Let's see.
Why is the weather so cold today?

452
00:23:01.533 --> 00:23:04.100 line:82%
-Why is the unit so small today?
-It's cozy.

453
00:23:06.133 --> 00:23:07.667 line:82%
It's
Fame
.

454
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.500 line:82%
"Dancing Queen."
Dirty Dancing
.

455
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.233 line:82%
You can…

456
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.166 line:82%
That isn't it.

457
00:23:13.233 --> 00:23:14.500 line:82%
This is
Dirty Dancing
.

458
00:23:14.567 --> 00:23:19.934 line:82%
'Cause I've had the time of my life

459
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.233 line:82%
Spin.

460
00:23:24.934 --> 00:23:26.166 line:82%
This is
Dirty Dancing
.

461
00:23:26.233 --> 00:23:27.834 line:82%
-You're good.
-Is this it?

462
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.633 line:82%
You should be a musical actor.

463
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.266 line:82%
Thank you, Na-ra.

464
00:23:38.934 --> 00:23:40.567 line:82%
What? Is this a dressing room?

465
00:23:41.367 --> 00:23:44.400 line:82%
The owner of this place
must really like flowers.

466
00:23:45.934 --> 00:23:47.433 line:82%
Why are there so many flowers?

467
00:23:52.266 --> 00:23:54.700 line:82%
There's a very old iron too.

468
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.967 line:82%
After spraying water,

469
00:24:02.033 --> 00:24:04.800 line:82%

Does she share this room with a man?

472
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.667 line:82%
The bed is huge.

473
00:24:24.967 --> 00:24:26.533 line:82%
Is that man her husband?

474
00:24:29.433 --> 00:24:31.533 line:82%
Do you know where they took him?

-No?

521
00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:03.066 line:82%

She had an affair.

531
00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:27.600 line:82%
Yes. Had it been her husband,
she would've gone, "He's my husband."

532
00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:29.433 line:82%
But she went, "He's someone I love."

Why did the thugs beat him up?

Take this, you punk!

542
00:27:55.233 --> 00:27:56.633 line:82%
Get a grip.

543
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.700 line:82%
The thugs can't be her older brothers.

544
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.333 line:82%
Maybe she asked the thugs to find him
because he ran with her money.

545
00:28:10.333 --> 00:28:12.333 line:82%
It was just an idea of mine.

546
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.867 line:82%
-"It was just an idea of mine."
-It's okay, Jung-ha.

547
00:28:14.934 --> 00:28:17.633 line:82%
-We're sharing our ideas.
-Okay.

548
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.967 line:82%
-So share your ideas.
-Understood.

549

There was something about liquor too.

550

Around the entertainment district,

551
00:28:26.633 --> 00:28:30.333 line:82%
gang members extort valuables
from business owners and customers.

552
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.200 line:82%
They force me to buy their…

553
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.867 line:82%
Perhaps they extorted money
from a distributor.

554
00:28:39.934 --> 00:28:41.100 line:82%
There was money.

555
00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:43.567 line:82%
They were obviously thugs

556
00:28:43.633 --> 00:28:46.500 line:82%
who seemed to be in charge
of an adult establishment.

557
00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:47.533 line:82%
Yes.

558
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.500 line:82%
What is their connection to the woman?

559
00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:51.300 line:82%
They can't be her brothers.

560
00:28:51.367 --> 00:28:53.500 line:82%
This is hard. Today's story is hard.

561
00:28:53.567 --> 00:28:56.500 line:82%
Were there any incidents
about extorting money back then?

562
00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:58.266 line:82%
-Extorting money?
-From a woman or…

563
00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:00.266 line:82%
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

564
00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:02.166 line:82%
I was an elementary schooler back then.

565
00:29:02.834 --> 00:29:04.233 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-I…

566
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.700 line:82%
I thought you were from the netherworld.

567
00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:10.567 line:82%
I was an elementary schooler
back in this era.

568
00:29:11.133 --> 00:29:13.367 line:82%
-Aren't you 900 years old?
-No.

569
00:29:13.433 --> 00:29:15.633 line:82%
Does my outfit give you that impression?

570
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.367 line:82%
Maybe.

571
00:29:17.433 --> 00:29:22.166 line:82%
It'll be hard for us to get
to the bottom of the story.

572
00:29:22.233 --> 00:29:23.233 line:82%
That's right.

573
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.500 line:82%
All right. Let's play a game.

-Here it is.

597
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.033 line:82%
These are difficult books.

-Gosh, Na-ra.

This unit is cold.

783
00:38:49.633 --> 00:38:51.934 line:82%
Our plan worked well.

784
00:38:59.967 --> 00:39:02.033 line:82%
-Can I flatten your hair?
-You can.

785
00:39:02.633 --> 00:39:03.867 line:82%
Look at me.

786
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.400 line:82%
You look so cute.

787
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.867 line:82%

-He does.

788

-What's for lunch?
-All right.

791
00:39:19.934 --> 00:39:21.133 line:82%
Is it Korean beef?

792
00:39:21.633 --> 00:39:24.834 line:82%
It's a special cut of beef.

793
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.100 line:82%
It's a special cut of beef.

794
00:39:27.166 --> 00:39:29.367 line:82%
-
Do we grill it?
-
Yes, grill it.

795
00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:30.467 line:82%
A special cut of beef.

796
00:39:30.533 --> 00:39:33.467 line:82%
-We get Korean beef?
-A special cut of beef. Enjoy.

797

What's in here? Vegetables?

798
00:39:36.567 --> 00:39:37.867 line:82%
What?

"Search unit 407."

801
00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:46.433 line:82%
-I think there's a hint in the unit.
-I know.

802
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.934 line:82%
I'll need to look around.

803
00:39:50.767 --> 00:39:52.000 line:82%
What could it be?

804
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.967 line:82%
It was open to this page.

All right.

For goodness' sake.

814
00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:53.066 line:82%
Gosh.

815
00:40:58.734 --> 00:41:02.166 line:82%
I can't figure it out
without a crucial hint.

816

Your food is here.

817

-Mr. Security Guard.
-Yes?

818
00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:10.834 line:82%
If you haven't had lunch,
why don't you eat with me?

819
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.266 line:82%
I don't like food made from flour.

820
00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:16.667 line:82%
It's
sujebi
. You need to make it yourself.

821
00:41:17.633 --> 00:41:19.567 line:82%
All the ingredients are here.

822
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:23.734 line:82%
You need to make it.

-Yes?

824

-Eat with me.
-I can't digest flour.

825

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.700 line:82%
-A special cut of beef.
-For goodness' sake.

830

I figured it out.

Tell me. We're on the same team.

846

856
00:43:47.767 --> 00:43:49.567 line:82%
-Are these dance steps?
-Dance steps.

857
00:43:49.633 --> 00:43:51.233 line:82%
How do you know?

858
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.633 line:82%
These are dance steps.

859
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.166 line:82%
So everything is related to dance.

860
00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:59.033 line:82%
I don't know what's going on.

861
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.100 line:82%
How is it related to that woman?

862

He's someone precious to me.

863
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.934 line:82%
-Have you seen this man?
-Yes, we have.

What was that money for?

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.000 line:82%
Shall we watch this first?
Let's watch this first.

868
00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:24.200 line:82%
We should watch it after Jae-seok leaves.

-All right.
-Come on.

870

-Go back to your unit now.
-All right.

871
00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.066 line:82%
You've spent enough time here.

872
00:44:30.133 --> 00:44:31.967 line:82%
I wouldn't say that.

873
00:44:32.834 --> 00:44:35.834 line:82%
-You should go back to your unit now.
-All right. For goodness' sake.

874
00:44:36.834 --> 00:44:39.533 line:82%
What's in unit 407?

875
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.100 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

876
00:44:55.367 --> 00:44:57.700 line:82%
Married women
in their thirties and forties

877
00:44:57.767 --> 00:45:00.233 line:82%
tend to visit…

878
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.500 line:82%
They visit somewhere.

879
00:45:01.567 --> 00:45:04.033 line:82%
Many of them ruin their lives here

880
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.500 line:82%
and shed tears.

881
00:45:07.066 --> 00:45:08.767 line:82%
The so-called…

882
00:45:08.834 --> 00:45:11.166 line:82%
Who are they?

883
00:45:11.734 --> 00:45:14.567 line:82%
I had friends with whom I saved money.

884
00:45:14.633 --> 00:45:17.166 line:82%
They said they were bored
and suggested going…

885
00:45:17.233 --> 00:45:20.166 line:82%
After three or four visits,
I was ensnared by a…

886
00:45:20.667 --> 00:45:22.033 line:82%
What?

887
00:45:23.266 --> 00:45:24.266 line:82%
It's a cabaret.

888
00:45:24.934 --> 00:45:26.200 line:82%
What's a cabaret?

889
00:45:26.266 --> 00:45:28.133 line:82%
-It's like a club.
-I see.

890
00:45:32.266 --> 00:45:33.734 line:82%
We're looking for a cabaret.

891
00:45:35.834 --> 00:45:37.433 line:82%
What did your husband do back then?

892
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.600 line:82%
My husband was abroad.

893
00:45:39.667 --> 00:45:41.266 line:82%
He had been away for a year.

894
00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:45.734 line:82%
He asked me to borrow 500,000 won
so that he could run a business.

895
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.900 line:82%
It didn't stop at once or twice.
He asked me three or four times.

896
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.266 line:82%
Over the course of four months,
I gave him about…

897
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.967 line:82%
Back then?

898
00:45:56.066 --> 00:45:57.600 line:82%
He blackmailed me.

899
00:45:58.233 --> 00:45:59.700 line:82%
They extort valuables

900
00:45:59.767 --> 00:46:01.834 line:82%
and break up families in the end.

901
00:46:03.033 --> 00:46:04.734 line:82%
While drinking, we…

902
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.367 line:82%
For many hours, we…
Then we had a conversation.

903
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:09.834 line:82%
"I'll tell your husband."

904
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.834 line:82%
I extorted money that way.

905
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.100 line:82%
What did they do for many hours?

906
00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.433 line:82%
Numerous…

907
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.300 line:82%
…exist in Seoul.

908
00:46:19.133 --> 00:46:22.934 line:82%
Their antics are becoming
more diverse and thorough by the day.

909
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.467 line:82%
Such evils will have no place in society.

910
00:46:30.934 --> 00:46:32.000 line:82%
What was that?

911
00:46:33.033 --> 00:46:34.834 line:82%
-A cabaret?
-Adultery.

912
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.467 line:82%
-A cabaret…
-It isn't a crime of adultery, is it?

913
00:46:37.967 --> 00:46:40.600 line:82%
It can't be a crackdown on cabarets.

914
00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:47.400 line:82%
Is the word that goes in the "blank…"

915
00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:49.000 line:82%
The…

916
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.266 line:82%
In that case…

917
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.066 line:82%
I'm certain it's…

918
00:46:58.133 --> 00:47:00.834 line:82%
I'm certain it's…

919
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.133 line:82%
Why?

920
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.400 line:82%
-Let's go, Detective JENNIE.
-Follow me.

921
00:47:04.467 --> 00:47:06.133 line:82%
-Let's go, Detective JENNIE.
-Follow me.

922
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.133 line:82%
-Let's go.
-What is it, Detective JENNIE?

923
00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.333 line:82%
-What?
-Violets.

924
00:47:14.967 --> 00:47:16.000 line:82%
-These are violets?
-Violets.

925
00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:17.133 line:82%
These are violets.

926
00:47:18.533 --> 00:47:21.066 line:82%
In here, everything is about dance.

927
00:47:21.133 --> 00:47:22.834 line:82%
So, gigolo.

928
00:47:23.667 --> 00:47:25.633 line:82%
The so-called "gigolos."

929
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.967 line:82%
Who are they?

930
00:47:33.934 --> 00:47:36.433 line:82%
This year, the nation saw economic growth.

931
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.233 line:82%
The economic boom will continue.

932
00:47:48.867 --> 00:47:51.767 line:82%
Gigolos approach women
in cabarets and nightclubs

933
00:47:51.834 --> 00:47:53.900 line:82%
using dance as an excuse.

934
00:47:54.467 --> 00:47:56.233 line:82%
Then they seduce married women

935
00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.266 line:82%
and use their weaknesses
to extort valuables.

936
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.100 line:82%
Gigolos must be good dancers.

937
00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:05.800 line:82%
For many hours, we dance.

938
00:48:05.867 --> 00:48:10.500 line:82%
We date women
in order to borrow money from them.

939
00:48:10.567 --> 00:48:14.867 line:82%
…Korean companies have been actively
expanding into the Middle East.

940
00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:18.500 line:82%
The construction industry foresees
a second Middle Eastern boom.

941
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.333 line:82%
They said they were bored
and suggested going dancing.

942
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.467 line:82%
After three or four visits,
I was ensnared by a
jebi-jok.

943
00:48:27.533 --> 00:48:30.333 line:82%
He threatened to tell my children.

944
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.133 line:82%
The National Security Headquarters
decided to root out
jebi-jok
,

945
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.800 line:82%
the delinquents who extort valuables
and break up families.

946
00:48:38.867 --> 00:48:41.967 line:82%
With the police,
they raided a secret dance hall

947
00:48:42.033 --> 00:48:43.734 line:82%
in Oryu-dong, Seoul.

948
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.066 line:82%
As people scrambled to avoid arrest,

949
00:48:46.133 --> 00:48:48.333 line:82%
they created chaos by turning over tables

950
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.633 line:82%
and breaking beer bottles.

951
00:48:54.767 --> 00:48:57.467 line:82%
We're right.
Even the wallpaper shows dancers.

952
00:48:57.533 --> 00:48:59.600 line:82%
All these clues are related to dance.

953
00:48:59.667 --> 00:49:02.633 line:82%
-
Violets.
Jebi-jok.
-
I think those are dance steps.

954
00:49:03.667 --> 00:49:06.467 line:82%
-
Gourd.
-
A swallow,
jebi, brings a gourd seed.

955
00:49:06.533 --> 00:49:08.033 line:82%
TALE OF HEUNG-BU

956
00:49:16.233 --> 00:49:18.467 line:82%
The woman and the man met at a dance hall

957
00:49:18.533 --> 00:49:19.633 line:82%
and fell in love.

958
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:20.967 line:82%
So they met while dancing.

959
00:49:21.033 --> 00:49:24.033 line:82%
The clues point to adultery too.

960
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.600 line:82%
If they met while dancing,

961
00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:33.433 line:82%
the place must've been a club.

962
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.433 line:82%
-So he really is a gigolo.
-Right?

963
00:49:37.934 --> 00:49:39.200 line:82%
Stop right there!

964
00:49:47.066 --> 00:49:49.033 line:82%
I have to eat something.

965
00:49:51.266 --> 00:49:54.100 line:82%
If I don't eat anything,

966
00:49:54.166 --> 00:49:59.400 line:82%
people will think that I'm not eating
because I'm alone.

967
00:50:00.934 --> 00:50:02.333 line:82%
But it isn't like that.

968
00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:05.467 line:82%
I feel like I'm filming
I Live Alone
.

969
00:50:08.166 --> 00:50:10.000 line:82%
Let's have a tasty meal.

970
00:50:10.834 --> 00:50:13.033 line:82%
All right. Those punks.

971
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.266 line:82%
I'll cook
ramyeon
in this broth.

972
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.166 line:82%
Hold on. What's 127?

973
00:50:26.934 --> 00:50:29.567 line:82%
I saw 127 someplace else too.

974
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.166 line:82%
Why do I keep seeing 127?

975
00:50:36.734 --> 00:50:38.200 line:82%
What's 127?

976
00:50:43.266 --> 00:50:45.066 line:82%
Look at this. It's 127.

977
00:50:45.133 --> 00:50:46.967 line:82%
It caught my eye earlier.

978
00:50:59.166 --> 00:51:01.500 line:82%
-What's 127?
-Seriously.

979
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.834 line:82%
What's 127?

980
00:51:04.867 --> 00:51:07.433 line:82%
Why is 127 everywhere?

981
00:51:08.967 --> 00:51:10.567 line:82%
What's 127?

982
00:51:11.734 --> 00:51:14.166 line:82%
-Isn't your birthday on January 27?
-No way.

983
00:51:14.233 --> 00:51:15.300 line:82%
-No?
-No.

984
00:51:15.367 --> 00:51:17.100 line:82%
You aren't 127 cm tall, are you?

985
00:51:18.934 --> 00:51:20.567 line:82%
I had to check.

986
00:51:22.667 --> 00:51:23.834 line:82%
What's 127?

987
00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.133 line:82%
Hold on. What's this?

988
00:51:27.934 --> 00:51:30.667 line:82%
-This is--
-It's a lake.

989
00:51:30.734 --> 00:51:33.400 line:82%
A lake. What's 127?

990
00:51:35.433 --> 00:51:37.567 line:82%
Did 127 mean anything back then?

991
00:51:37.633 --> 00:51:39.533 line:82%
I don't know what 127 is.

992
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.600 line:82%
-I only know about NCT 127.
-What?

993
00:51:41.667 --> 00:51:43.433 line:82%
-NCT 127.
-What's that?

994
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.900 line:82%
An idol group.

995
00:51:46.633 --> 00:51:49.233 line:82%
I said I didn't know what it was.
This is bad.

996
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.400 line:82%
-Are they famous?
-Very.

997
00:51:51.467 --> 00:51:52.800 line:82%
Oh, no.

998
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.166 line:82%
JAE-SEOK LIVES ALONE

999
00:52:04.967 --> 00:52:06.667 line:82%
Is it boiling?

1000
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.734 line:82%
All right. Let's eat first.

1001
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.967 line:82%
Even hiking Mount Kumgang should be done
after a meal.

1002
00:52:12.033 --> 00:52:14.000 line:82%
I'll think about it after I eat.

1003
00:52:14.667 --> 00:52:16.266 line:82%
I'll put
ramyeon
in here.

1004
00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:20.233 line:82%
This is nice. My goodness.

1005
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.467 line:82%
It looks delicious.

1006
00:52:22.033 --> 00:52:23.166 line:82%
My goodness.

1007
00:52:26.133 --> 00:52:27.834 line:82%
Since this is broth…

1008
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.100 line:82%
Sujebi ramyeon
.

1009
00:52:47.467 --> 00:52:50.033 line:82%
Gosh, this is…

1010
00:53:08.166 --> 00:53:10.033 line:82%
This is a taste that makes you go wild.

1011
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.700 line:82%
Even though it's just
ramyeon
…

1012
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.834 line:82%
That's all there is?

1013
00:53:40.533 --> 00:53:42.133 line:82%
I had three mouthfuls.

1014
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.934 line:82%
It's so tasty. I'm not jealous
of any delicacy right now.

1015
00:53:49.967 --> 00:53:52.166 line:82%
Let's cook it here.

1016
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.300 line:82%
Is this side burnt?

1017
00:53:56.367 --> 00:53:57.367 line:82%
Eat it.

1018
00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.266 line:82%
Is it good?

1019
00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:03.033 line:82%
It's tasty.

1020
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.066 line:82%
-Yes.
-I keep eating it.

1021
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.367 line:82%
Thank you.

1022
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:14.400 line:82%
It's tasty.

1023
00:54:16.266 --> 00:54:19.900 line:82%
I don't know what we're supposed to find.

1024
00:54:19.967 --> 00:54:20.800 line:82%
Today?

1025
00:54:20.867 --> 00:54:23.133 line:82%
-The gigolo?
-That's what I want to know.

1026
00:54:24.467 --> 00:54:26.467 line:82%
I don't know what the money was about.

1027
00:54:27.667 --> 00:54:29.033 line:82%
Let go of me.

1028
00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:33.467 line:82%
I know. Why was he running away
with money?

1029
00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:37.000 line:82%
Money isn't the only problem. What's 127?

1030
00:54:42.233 --> 00:54:44.233 line:82%
I'm so curious. What's the secret today?

1031
00:54:46.367 --> 00:54:47.500 line:82%
What?

1032
00:54:47.567 --> 00:54:48.934 line:82%
-I got goose bumps.
-Why?

1033
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.700 line:82%
I know this because I've eaten it before.

1034
00:54:51.767 --> 00:54:53.433 line:82%
-It's game over.
-Is it good?

1035
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.667 line:82%
-Because it tastes good?
-No.

1036
00:54:55.233 --> 00:54:57.500 line:82%
Na-ra, this cut is
the beef neck chain,
jebichuri
.

1037
00:54:58.433 --> 00:55:00.300 line:82%
Na-ra, this cut is
the beef neck chain,
jebichuri
.

1038
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.734 line:82%
It's a special cut of beef.

1039
00:55:08.333 --> 00:55:10.800 line:82%
-
Jebichuri
.
-I should've known.

1040
00:55:10.867 --> 00:55:13.500 line:82%
Thus, we need to find the gigolo today.

1041
00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.734 line:82%
Thus, we need to find the gigolo today.

1042
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.533 line:82%
-So that's why we got
jebichuri
.
-Yes.

1043
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.934 line:82%
You like how I figured that out?

1044
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.467 line:82%
-That was impressive.
-Yes.

1045
00:55:26.967 --> 00:55:30.367 line:82%
Then Jae-seok must be the gigolo.

1046
00:55:31.033 --> 00:55:33.033 line:82%
Why would Jae-seok be the gigolo?

1047
00:55:34.133 --> 00:55:35.834 line:82%
-He keeps going off on his own.
-We're suspicious.

1048
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.133 line:82%
Are you suspecting me now?

1049
00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.400 line:82%
You suspected two people.

1050
00:55:40.467 --> 00:55:42.100 line:82%
You're a bit strange today.

1051
00:55:46.066 --> 00:55:48.867 line:82%
You're using your acting voice today.
You're a bit off.

1052
00:55:50.033 --> 00:55:51.433 line:82%
She thinks you're a bit off.

1053
00:55:52.333 --> 00:55:55.233 line:82%
You know this, right?
Once you begin suspecting someone,

1054
00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.734 line:82%
-you can't stop.
-Right.

1055
00:55:57.433 --> 00:55:59.667 line:82%
Do you think Jae-seok is the gigolo?

1056
00:55:59.734 --> 00:56:00.834 line:82%
Yes.

1057
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.633 line:82%
Tae-hyun, I have a question.

1058
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:05.567 line:82%
Jae-seok is in that predicament
because of his outfit, right?

1059
00:56:05.633 --> 00:56:08.500 line:82%
Here's the thing about Jae-seok.

1060
00:56:08.567 --> 00:56:11.433 line:82%
-It was because of his outfit.
-Here's the thing about him.

1061
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.033 line:82%
-It's time for him to play a role.
-It's about time.

1062
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.433 line:82%
There are reasons.

1063
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.333 line:82%
-And only his outfit looks strange.
-Right.

1064
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.033 line:82%
We don't know what we're supposed to do
with the gigolo.

1065
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.300 line:82%
That's why I'm confused.

1066
00:56:24.266 --> 00:56:30.667 line:82%
-We don't know yet.
-It might be a ploy to distract us.

1067
00:56:31.166 --> 00:56:32.567 line:82%
-There must be a meaning.
-Right?

1068
00:56:32.633 --> 00:56:34.734 line:82%
-I agree.
-We just don't have enough hints yet.

1069
00:56:40.266 --> 00:56:42.033 line:82%
Why… Where is he going?

1070
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.834 line:82%
When you begin to suspect someone,

1071
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.633 line:82%
everything they do looks suspicious.

1072
00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.300 line:82%
He keeps disappearing.

1073
00:56:54.767 --> 00:56:57.467 line:82%
I'm the only one who looks after you.

1074
00:56:57.967 --> 00:57:01.367 line:82%
Jae-seok, I've figured out everything.

1075
00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.934 line:82%
-I see why you got cornered.
-Why?

1076
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.300 line:82%
Why isn't Jung-ha back yet?

1077
00:57:08.367 --> 00:57:10.934 line:82%
-He had no reason to leave like that.
-Seriously.

1078
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.934 line:82%
-He was very suspicious just now.
-Yes.

1079
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.500 line:82%
They're talking about everything.

1080
00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:19.667 line:82%
Jae-seok, you need to help me.

1081
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.467 line:82%
Tae-hyun, there must be more than one.

1082
00:57:22.533 --> 00:57:26.867 line:82%
I don't know what they're scheming
in the other unit.

1083
00:57:26.934 --> 00:57:30.633 line:82%
In that unit,
there are three drawings of lakes.

1084
00:57:33.834 --> 00:57:36.133 line:82%
In that unit,
there are three drawings of lakes.

1085
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.433 line:82%
-They must mean--
-Lakes?

1086
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.333 line:82%
-Lakes.
-Seriously.

1087
00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.000 line:82%
Is 127 a unit number?

1088
00:57:44.066 --> 00:57:46.233 line:82%
-A unit number?
-A unit number.

1089
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.300 line:82%
Unit 127? It's the first floor.

1090
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.266 line:82%
Or the seventh unit on the twelfth floor?

1091
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:57.734 line:82%
I think it could be as you said
since there were drawings of lakes.

1092
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.834 line:82%
Is it related to a unit number?

1093
00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:03.900 line:82%
Perhaps we'll find something
when we go there.

1094
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.700 line:82%
I'll go to unit 407.

1095
00:58:10.767 --> 00:58:12.734 line:82%
There must be something.

1096
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.133 line:82%
Let's go.

1097
00:58:17.633 --> 00:58:18.667 line:82%
-Is he back?
-Tae-hyun,

1098
00:58:18.734 --> 00:58:20.834 line:82%
-I'll use it.
-Why are you still eating?

1099
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.000 line:82%
Hey, what's up with you?

1100
00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:25.600 line:82%
-I want
ramyeon
too.
-The
ramyeon
is really tasty.

1101
00:58:25.667 --> 00:58:27.133 line:82%
Jung-ha, the four of us talked.

1102
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.467 line:82%
You're out of the group.

1103
00:58:28.533 --> 00:58:30.300 line:82%
-What's up with you?
-Sorry.

1104
00:58:30.367 --> 00:58:32.467 line:82%
Think about it.
The clue was for the five of us.

1105
00:58:32.533 --> 00:58:34.400 line:82%
But the two of you disappeared.

1106
00:58:35.033 --> 00:58:37.333 line:82%
I was only making deductions
in the other unit.

1107
00:58:50.133 --> 00:58:52.000 line:82%
-She came.
-What?

1108
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.734 line:82%
-She came.
-She came.

1109
00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.900 line:82%
Did you find the man by any chance?

1110
00:58:58.934 --> 00:59:01.734 line:82%
Please look at this photo.

1111
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.867 line:82%
-We haven't found him.
-We haven't found him,

1112
00:59:04.934 --> 00:59:07.500 line:82%
but we saw him fighting with some thugs.

1113
00:59:07.567 --> 00:59:10.133 line:82%
Do you know where he went?

1114
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.500 line:82%
We don't know that.

1115
00:59:12.233 --> 00:59:14.100 line:82%
He made a right turn.

1116
00:59:14.667 --> 00:59:16.633 line:82%
-He ran off with money.
-Really?

1117
00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:17.533 line:82%
The money…

1118
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.500 line:82%
Is he your husband?

1119
00:59:19.567 --> 00:59:22.200 line:82%
-Is he your boyfriend?
-What's the nature of your relationship?

1120
00:59:23.133 --> 00:59:26.867 line:82%
To be honest, he isn't my husband.

1121
00:59:26.934 --> 00:59:29.533 line:82%
-He's my boyfriend. We met at a cabaret.
-I knew it.

1122
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.967 line:82%
It seemed that way.

1123
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.533 line:82%
-He's a gigolo.
-That's right. That explains the money.

1124
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.433 line:82%
I knew it. It seemed that way.

1125
00:59:47.266 --> 00:59:48.633 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1126
00:59:50.734 --> 00:59:54.667 line:82%
Would you please help me find him?

1127
00:59:54.734 --> 00:59:58.133 line:82%
My husband will kill me
if I don't find him.

1128
00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.567 line:82%
-Why?
-Why?

1129
00:59:59.633 --> 01:00:00.967 line:82%
Did you give him money?

1130
01:00:01.033 --> 01:00:04.800 line:82%
He took my money and a very precious item.

1131
01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:07.266 line:82%
…and a very precious item.

1132
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.033 line:82%
I really need to find it.
My husband will kill me if I don't.

1133
01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.967 line:82%
-What kind of item is it?
-What is it?

1134
01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.967 line:82%
I can't tell you.

1135
01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.834 line:82%
If I don't get it back,

1136
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.100 line:82%
my husband will beat me to death.

1137
01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:26.400 line:82%
Don't worry. We'll find the item.

1138
01:00:26.467 --> 01:00:27.800 line:82%
Please find it.

1139
01:00:27.867 --> 01:00:30.300 line:82%
What was that?
Who are you to say you can find it?

1140
01:00:30.367 --> 01:00:33.300 line:82%
-What was that?
-His voice sounded weak too.

1141
01:00:33.367 --> 01:00:34.600 line:82%
What was that?

1142
01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:37.934 line:82%
I really need to find it.

1143
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.834 line:82%
I'll be kicked out of this house.

1144
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.967 line:82%
-All right. We'll find it.
-We heard you.

1145
01:00:42.033 --> 01:00:44.800 line:82%
-You need to tell us if you want help.
-Where should we go?

1146
01:00:44.867 --> 01:00:46.767 line:82%
-Is there a clue?
-I don't know.

1147
01:00:46.834 --> 01:00:49.767 line:82%
-You don't know.
-I don't know where the man went.

1148
01:00:49.834 --> 01:00:52.633 line:82%
-I'll look for him, so please do the same.
-Okay.

1149
01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.500 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Okay.

1150
01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:56.133 line:82%
Eat some
ramyeon
before you go.

1151
01:00:56.633 --> 01:00:59.100 line:82%
She isn't in the right state of mind
for that right now.

1152
01:00:59.166 --> 01:01:00.834 line:82%
I need to find him.

1153
01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:05.834 line:82%
What could the item be?

1154
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.033 line:82%
-Why is she so scared?
-Good question.

1155
01:01:08.633 --> 01:01:11.834 line:82%
What's her precious item?
What's there other than money?

1156
01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.400 line:82%
She said her husband would kill her
if she didn't find it.

1157
01:01:14.467 --> 01:01:16.100 line:82%
-House deed?
-Bankbook?

1158
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.333 line:82%
-What is it?
-It's so hard.

1159
01:01:20.367 --> 01:01:23.233 line:82%
You're using your acting voice today.
You're a bit off.

1160
01:01:24.133 --> 01:01:26.767 line:82%
Is 127 a unit number?

1161
01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:40.567 line:82%
Dear residents,
please come to the Senior Center.

1162
01:01:40.633 --> 01:01:43.033 line:82%
Today… It isn't you, is it?

1163
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.200 line:82%
It really isn't me.

1164
01:01:44.266 --> 01:01:46.967 line:82%
-JENNIE, it isn't you, is it?
-Do I look bloated today?

1165
01:01:47.033 --> 01:01:48.867 line:82%
-What?
-Why did you change the subject?

1166
01:01:48.934 --> 01:01:51.033 line:82%
I had
mala
hot pot last night.

1167
01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.233 line:82%
-You look fine.
-You look especially pretty.

1168
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.133 line:82%
-Thank you.
-I'm serious.

1169
01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.900 line:82%
What do you mean by especially pretty?

1170
01:01:57.967 --> 01:01:59.834 line:82%
I should use that. "How do I look today?"

1171
01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.333 line:82%
"You look especially pretty."

1172
01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.000 line:82%
-Se-chan, look at the leaves.
-What?

1173
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.600 line:82%
Catch them for a clue.

1174
01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:09.066 line:82%
A hint on the gigolo.

1175
01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.900 line:82%
We've gotten so obsessive.

1176
01:02:12.967 --> 01:02:15.200 line:82%
-I even suspect people at home.
-I know.

1177
01:02:15.266 --> 01:02:16.867 line:82%
Time for another legendary game.

1178
01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:18.834 line:82%
We're here.

1179
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.600 line:82%
Earlier, I had
ramyeon
.

1180
01:02:20.667 --> 01:02:24.367 line:82%
The empty packet looked dirty,
so I wanted to throw it away.

1181
01:02:24.433 --> 01:02:26.467 line:82%
But I couldn't find a trash can.

1182
01:02:26.533 --> 01:02:29.433 line:82%
I was wondering what to do
when a cameraman motioned me

1183
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.367 line:82%
to give it to him.

1184
01:02:31.433 --> 01:02:35.033 line:82%
I thought, "There must be
a trash can behind him."

1185
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.767 line:82%
When I gave it to him,

1186
01:02:36.834 --> 01:02:39.934 line:82%
-he put it in his pocket. Seriously.
-He put it in his pocket.

1187
01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:42.700 line:82%
There isn't a trash can.

1188
01:02:45.033 --> 01:02:46.033 line:82%
Here you go.

1189
01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:49.166 line:82%
Here you go.

1190
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.934 line:82%
My goodness, thank you.

1191
01:02:55.934 --> 01:02:57.667 line:82%
He put it in his pocket.

1192
01:02:57.734 --> 01:02:59.133 line:82%
-How cool.
-Why did he take it?

1193
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.567 line:82%
-Why did he ask for it?
-How cool.

1194
01:03:01.633 --> 01:03:03.000 line:82%
Seriously.

1195
01:03:03.066 --> 01:03:05.333 line:82%
I would've been smitten.

1196
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.567 line:82%
That's right.

1197
01:03:09.033 --> 01:03:12.800 line:82%
The game you'll play this time is
the Nonsense Proverb Game.

1198
01:03:12.867 --> 01:03:15.467 line:82%
-What's that?
-Nonsense Proverb Game.

1199
01:03:15.533 --> 01:03:19.166 line:82%
A bear wearing a rabbit-ear headband
fell on its butt while sledding.

1200
01:03:19.233 --> 01:03:20.900 line:82%
-We'll make…
-Is that an actual proverb?

1201
01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:23.066 line:82%
-…nonsense proverbs like this.
-I see.

1202
01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:27.000 line:82%
Jung-ha will act out the subject,
"A bear wearing a rabbit-ear headband."

1203
01:03:27.066 --> 01:03:30.166 line:82%
Another person will get the predicate,
"Fell on its butt while sledding."

1204
01:03:30.233 --> 01:03:32.667 line:82%
-Guess the nonsense proverb.
-We need to guess it.

1205
01:03:32.734 --> 01:03:34.867 line:82%
It's doable.
I thought it involved real proverbs.

1206
01:03:34.934 --> 01:03:37.166 line:82%
What do you want?
Shall I take the predicate?

1207
01:03:37.233 --> 01:03:38.166 line:82%
Want the subject?

1208
01:03:38.233 --> 01:03:40.333 line:82%
-Which one do you want?
-I think he'll do well.

1209
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.834 line:82%
What do you think?

1210
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.934 line:82%
Ready, go.

1211
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.500 line:82%
I have the subject, right?

1212
01:03:45.567 --> 01:03:46.567 line:82%
Hold on.

1213
01:03:49.066 --> 01:03:50.367 line:82%
Woman.

1214
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.633 line:82%
-Woman.
-No.

1215
01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.633 line:82%
Wig. Hair.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.100 line:82%
-Long. Rapunzel.
-Yes.

1217
01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.266 line:82%
Princess.

1218
01:03:58.333 --> 01:03:59.633 line:82%
Yu Jae-seok.

1219
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.567 line:82%
No.

1220
01:04:03.133 --> 01:04:04.467 line:82%
What are you doing?

1221
01:04:05.834 --> 01:04:07.467 line:82%
Long-haired.

1222
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.934 line:82%

01:04:24.266 --> 01:04:26.033 line:82%
A stomachache.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.934 line:82%
A stomachache. B-boy.

1230
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000 line:82%
Dancing like a b-boy with a stomachache.

1231
01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:38.567 line:82%
My goodness.

1232
01:04:38.633 --> 01:04:40.367 line:82%
My goodness, she's good.

1233
01:04:40.433 --> 01:04:42.066 line:82%
Well done.

1234
01:04:42.133 --> 01:04:43.233 line:82%
Well done.

1235
01:04:48.066 --> 01:04:49.900 line:82%
-It was hard.
-A muscular man.

1236
01:04:49.967 --> 01:04:51.633 line:82%

A muscular dog.

1239
01:04:58.834 --> 01:05:00.166 line:82%
Yoga.

1240
01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.767 line:82%
That's unsightly.

1241
01:05:07.834 --> 01:05:09.100 line:82%
Yoga.

1242
01:05:11.467 --> 01:05:13.133 line:82%

1244
01:05:15.734 --> 01:05:17.567 line:82%
Like this.

1245
01:05:17.633 --> 01:05:19.133 line:82%
-He's good.

1246
01:05:19.867 --> 01:05:21.166 line:82%
Stretching.

1249
01:05:26.066 --> 01:05:27.266 line:82%
What is it? Hold on.

1250
01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:28.767 line:82%
"Let's do this."

1251
01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.633 line:82%
-A mermaid?
-No.

1252
01:05:32.633 --> 01:05:34.700 line:82%
Pilates. I see.

1253
01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:39.700 line:82%
He's good at explaining.

1254
01:05:42.734 --> 01:05:44.967 line:82%
-Doing Pilates while farting.
-Okay.

1255
01:05:45.033 --> 01:05:45.867 line:82%
Okay.

1256
01:05:45.934 --> 01:05:48.166 line:82%
-Oh, my god.
-Okay.

1257
01:05:48.233 --> 01:05:49.600 line:82%
Good.

1258
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.734 line:82%
Your ears are covered.

1259
01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:54.433 line:82%
Listening to music.

1260
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.266 line:82%
Wearing earphones and listening to music.

1261
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.367 line:82%
Sloth.

1262
01:06:03.433 --> 01:06:05.934 line:82%
A sloth listening to music.

1263
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.700 line:82%
A sloth wearing earphones.

1264
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.100 line:82%
Putting on a backpack.

1265
01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.000 line:82%
Putting on a backpack.

1266
01:06:29.567 --> 01:06:31.333 line:82%
-Skydiving!
-Yes!

1267
01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:33.834 line:82%
-All right.
-They're good.

1268
01:06:34.333 --> 01:06:35.867 line:82%
-Skydiving!
-Yes!

1269
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.400 line:82%
All right.

1270
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.633 line:82%
-Hey.
-That was incredible.

1271
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.900 line:82%
-Hey.
-That was incredible.

1272
01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:45.633 line:82%
How did she guess?

1273
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.166 line:82%
Three, two, one.

1274
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.266 line:82%
Give them a hard one.

1275
01:07:03.233 --> 01:07:05.000 line:82%
There you go. It's hard.

1276
01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:07.767 line:82%
An itchy back.

1277
01:07:07.834 --> 01:07:10.500 line:82%
Come here. Lie down.

1278
01:07:10.567 --> 01:07:13.000 line:82%
-An itchy back.
-Okay.

1279
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.900 line:82%
-What are you guys doing?
-A wrestler.

1280
01:07:15.967 --> 01:07:17.800 line:82%
-What are you guys doing?
-A wrestler.

1281
01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.467 line:82%
-Okay.
-What are you guys doing?

1282
01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:24.200 line:82%
-All right.
-A wrestler with an itchy back.

1283
01:07:24.266 --> 01:07:26.900 line:82%
Jump roping.

1284
01:07:26.967 --> 01:07:29.367 line:82%
What was it called? Double under?

1285
01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.266 line:82%
-Jump roping.
-One. Two.

1286
01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:33.667 line:82%
Double Dutch?

1287
01:07:33.734 --> 01:07:35.467 line:82%
She's really good.

1288
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.100 line:82%
I'll eat this.

1289
01:07:46.834 --> 01:07:48.233 line:82%
My goodness.

1290
01:07:49.133 --> 01:07:51.233 line:82%
Eating something around bedtime?

1291
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.800 line:82%
Late at night…

1292
01:07:54.834 --> 01:07:56.100 line:82%
"Late at night."

1293
01:07:57.867 --> 01:08:00.433 line:82%
-Eating a late-night snack!
-Correct.

1294
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.967 line:82%
My goodness.

1295
01:08:02.033 --> 01:08:04.333 line:82%
-Eating a late-night snack!
-Correct.

1296
01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.867 line:82%
My goodness.

1297
01:08:09.834 --> 01:08:11.266 line:82%
She's good.

1298
01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:13.967 line:82%
-So witty.
-They're good.

1299
01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:17.500 line:82%
Correct.

1300
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.400 line:82%
-The game ends with the Chas' victory.
-Okay.

1301
01:08:22.467 --> 01:08:23.567 line:82%
We have a clue.

1302
01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:25.500 line:82%
Today, the losing team will get hints too.

1303
01:08:25.567 --> 01:08:28.166 line:82%
-Really? Give them to us.
-The winners, the losers.

1304
01:08:28.233 --> 01:08:29.700 line:82%
We get two each.

1305
01:08:29.767 --> 01:08:31.200 line:82%
What's inside?

1306
01:08:31.266 --> 01:08:32.333 line:82%
Let's go and take a look.

1307
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.567 line:82%
He took my money

1308
01:08:43.633 --> 01:08:45.633 line:82%
and a very precious item.

1309
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.333 line:82%
I really need to find it.

1310
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.000 line:82%
I think I'll accomplish something today.

1311
01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:59.000 line:82%
Shall we check out the hint?

1312
01:08:59.066 --> 01:09:01.100 line:82%
Did we get two hints?

1313
01:09:01.166 --> 01:09:03.033 line:82%
-We got two today.
-We got two today.

1314
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.767 line:82%
-
Is this the first one?
-
"Watch after the first one."

1315
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.734 line:82%
WATCH AFTER THE FIRST ONE

1316
01:09:15.433 --> 01:09:17.667 line:82%
Why are there two?

1317
01:09:18.834 --> 01:09:21.367 line:82%
What's "Grade Three,
Class Two, Number Five"?

1318
01:09:22.633 --> 01:09:23.633 line:82%
Are there two?

1319
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:24.934 line:82%
-I think so.
-I think so.

1320
01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:31.300 line:82%
Let's watch this first.

1321
01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:33.533 line:82%
-Okay.
-The first video.

1322
01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.300 line:82%
We got two videos.
The winning team got more, right?

1323
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.233 line:82%
Play.

1324
01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.934 line:82%
Hello, viewers.

1325
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.767 line:82%
The biggest meth cartel in Korea

1326
01:09:55.834 --> 01:09:59.200 line:82%
that made and sold meth nationwide
valued at 150 billion won

1327
01:09:59.266 --> 01:10:02.867 line:82%
has been caught by the prosecution.

1328
01:10:03.467 --> 01:10:04.367 line:82%
Meth?

1329
01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:06.033 line:82%
-It was about drugs?
-Oh, my god.

1330
01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.867 line:82%
-Drugs.
-
…has been caught by the prosecution.

1331
01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.967 line:82%
Why do I keep seeing 127?

1332
01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:13.433 line:82%
What's 127?

1333
01:10:14.233 --> 01:10:16.900 line:82%
What's 127? Hold on. What's this?

1334
01:10:25.467 --> 01:10:30.767 line:82%
The arrested drug dealers
had boldly made 220 kg of meth.

1335
01:10:30.834 --> 01:10:32.700 line:82%
-Really?
-No way.

1336
01:10:32.767 --> 01:10:35.567 line:82%
The amount of meth they made
is equivalent to 7,300,000 doses

1337
01:10:35.633 --> 01:10:37.900 line:82%
and worth over 150 billion won.

1338
01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:41.133 line:82%
-Imagine 150 billion won back then.
-Seriously.

1339
01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.600 line:82%
Were drugs prevalent even back then?

1340
01:10:44.667 --> 01:10:45.500 line:82%
Seriously.

1341
01:10:45.567 --> 01:10:47.433 line:82%
Is it a drug cartel?

1342
01:10:49.367 --> 01:10:52.600 line:82%
The ones who got caught making and selling
large quantities of drugs,

1343
01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:54.333 line:82%
married couple…

1344
01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.734 line:82%
…had a secret factory set up
inside the apartment.

1345
01:10:58.533 --> 01:11:00.400 line:82%
-What?
-
…a secret factory set up…

1346
01:11:00.467 --> 01:11:02.600 line:82%
A secret factory set up
inside the apartment?

1347
01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:06.800 line:82%
They sold large quantities of meth
to a Japanese smuggling ring

1348
01:11:06.867 --> 01:11:09.066 line:82%
as well as American buyers.

1349
01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:17.300 line:82%
-A married couple?
-It was inside the apartment.

1350
01:11:17.367 --> 01:11:19.734 line:82%
-So there are two. I knew it.
-That's right.

1351
01:11:20.867 --> 01:11:23.266 line:82%
The married couple is among us.
The husband.

1352
01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:24.533 line:82%
The husband is among us.

1353
01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:31.400 line:82%
The couple was at the helm
of Korea's biggest drug trafficking ring.

1354
01:11:31.467 --> 01:11:34.367 line:82%
They set up a drug factory
inside the apartment

1355
01:11:34.433 --> 01:11:37.700 line:82%
and pretended to be ordinary residents.

1356
01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.867 line:82%
Currently, the couple is on the run.

1357
01:11:42.867 --> 01:11:44.066 line:82%
-What?
-What is it?

1358
01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.834 line:82%
It's that woman from earlier.

1359
01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:47.934 line:82%
-It's her.
-It's her.

1360
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.600 line:82%
How chilling.
She's the woman we saw earlier.

1361
01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.834 line:82%
Currently, the couple is on the run.

1362
01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.433 line:82%
Have you seen this man?

1363
01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:00.066 line:82%
He's someone precious to me.

1364
01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.367 line:82%
I guess the gigolo ran with the drugs.

1365
01:12:08.433 --> 01:12:10.867 line:82%
She said it'd be bad
if her husband found out.

1366
01:12:10.934 --> 01:12:12.300 line:82%
-Drugs.
-The couple.

1367
01:12:12.367 --> 01:12:15.133 line:82%
The wife has been identified,

1368
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.200 line:82%
but information on the husband
is quite limited.

1369
01:12:18.266 --> 01:12:21.000 line:82%
-
We ask for any information you may have.
-Look at his physique.

1370
01:12:21.066 --> 01:12:22.266 line:82%
Is that Tae-hyun?

1371
01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:24.033 line:82%
-Se-chan.
-It's Se-chan.

1372
01:12:24.734 --> 01:12:26.133 line:82%
Is that Se-chan?

1373
01:12:27.166 --> 01:12:30.200 line:82%
The man and woman are similar in height.
Is that Se-chan?

1374
01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:32.900 line:82%
-Then the spy is a man.
-Yes.

1375
01:12:32.967 --> 01:12:35.367 line:82%
-The married couple…
-Tae-hyun is in trouble.

1376
01:12:35.433 --> 01:12:37.633 line:82%
-The married couple…
-Tae-hyun is in trouble.

1377
01:12:40.266 --> 01:12:42.300 line:82%
The drug trafficking couple. Okay.

1378
01:12:42.367 --> 01:12:43.934 line:82%
-Okay.
-The first video.

1379
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.467 line:82%
Okay. So we need to catch the husband.

1380
01:12:46.533 --> 01:12:47.700 line:82%
Put the second tape in.

1381
01:12:56.233 --> 01:12:57.166 line:82%
-What?
-What?

1382
01:12:57.233 --> 01:12:58.233 line:82%
What?

1383
01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.767 line:82%
-It's him.
-That gigolo.

1384
01:13:05.033 --> 01:13:07.700 line:82%
Love isn't a sin!

1385
01:13:09.233 --> 01:13:11.233 line:82%
-Have you seen this man?
-Yes, we have.

1386
01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.266 line:82%
-He's someone precious to me.
-Really?

1387
01:13:14.333 --> 01:13:15.867 line:82%
-What?
-It's him.

1388
01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:17.467 line:82%
-The gigolo.
-The gigolo.

1389
01:13:17.533 --> 01:13:22.300 line:82%
I'm the gigolo who manipulated people
for my own gain.

1390
01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:27.333 line:82%
However, I'm also this couple's victim.

1391
01:13:28.066 --> 01:13:30.033 line:82%
This is driving me crazy.

1392
01:13:31.233 --> 01:13:33.867 line:82%
They drugged me secretly

1393
01:13:33.934 --> 01:13:37.300 line:82%
and threatened to call the police
if I didn't deliver drugs.

1394
01:13:37.834 --> 01:13:40.533 line:82%
Before more people fall victim like me,

1395
01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.800 line:82%
I want to confess everything
to the police.

1396
01:13:44.367 --> 01:13:47.633 line:82%
So I hid the drug suitcase
I was supposed to deliver

1397
01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.667 line:82%
in a secret place.

1398
01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:51.700 line:82%
He took my money

1399
01:13:51.767 --> 01:13:53.800 line:82%
and a very precious item.

1400
01:13:53.867 --> 01:13:56.934 line:82%
…my husband will beat me to death.

1401
01:13:58.133 --> 01:14:01.834 line:82%
-The precious object was drugs.
-I see.

1402
01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:02.900 line:82%
A secret place.

1403
01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:08.600 line:82%
I want to share the location with you,

1404
01:14:08.667 --> 01:14:12.433 line:82%
but I heard the husband's voice
at the
tteokbokki
place.

1405
01:14:13.233 --> 01:14:15.333 line:82%
He heard the husband's voice.

1406
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.500 line:82%
-It's one of us.
-The husband is one of us.

1407
01:14:19.066 --> 01:14:22.133 line:82%
-How mischievous.
-Mister, you're annoying.

1408
01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.433 line:82%
My goodness.

1409
01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.467 line:82%
Who is it among us?

1410
01:14:36.367 --> 01:14:39.567 line:82%
Find the missing suitcase
before the husband

1411
01:14:39.633 --> 01:14:41.533 line:82%
and burn it in the incinerator.

1412
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.000 line:82%
-The incinerator was at the playground.
-Yes.

1413
01:14:45.066 --> 01:14:47.000 line:82%
We need to put it there.

1414
01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:48.166 line:82%
-I found it.
-Don't lie.

1415
01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:49.734 line:82%
Tell us.

1416
01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.400 line:82%
If you look at the incinerator…

1417
01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.633 line:82%
-Today, we need to find something.
-And burn it there?

1418
01:15:00.767 --> 01:15:02.233 line:82%
-The incinerator.
-You're right.

1419
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.000 line:82%
-How did you know?
-It was a hunch.

1420
01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.233 line:82%
There was a reason why I avoided them.

1421
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:11.233 line:82%
I told you earlier
that the woman was a bad person.

1422
01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:15.367 line:82%
The one who tried to disregard
my opinion was Se-chan.

1423
01:15:15.433 --> 01:15:18.000 line:82%
-The woman is a bad person.
-Why?

1424
01:15:19.066 --> 01:15:22.400 line:82%
-We feel for her more than the man, right?
-Yes.

1425
01:15:22.467 --> 01:15:24.400 line:82%
-That's what's dangerous.
-Nonsense.

1426
01:15:24.467 --> 01:15:26.834 line:82%
He makes deductions haphazardly.

1427
01:15:29.467 --> 01:15:32.633 line:82%
Whenever I brought it up,
Se-chan changed the subject.

1428
01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.266 line:82%
-So the husband is among us.
-Yes.

1429
01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:36.800 line:82%
And it's you, Tae-hyun.

1430
01:15:36.867 --> 01:15:38.967 line:82%
It isn't me. Why do you keep saying that?

1431
01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:41.200 line:82%
-Then…
-Why do you keep saying that?

1432
01:15:41.266 --> 01:15:43.033 line:82%
-Everyone suspects you.
-For goodness' sake.

1433
01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.867 line:82%
-Jae-seok or you.
-The one who's it stays the quietest.

1434
01:15:46.934 --> 01:15:48.500 line:82%
-Was I quiet today?
-Yes.

1435
01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.433 line:82%
You were much quieter than usual.

1436
01:15:55.667 --> 01:15:57.533 line:82%
This is an announcement.

1437
01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.467 line:82%
The husband who is hiding among you
is carrying out a special mission.

1438
01:16:03.533 --> 01:16:07.033 line:82%
Firstly, he made physical contact
with the wife.

1439
01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:07.967 line:82%
-What?
-What?

1440
01:16:08.033 --> 01:16:12.834 line:82%
Secondly, he succeeded in the mission
of hearing "like" from the members.

1441
01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.000 line:82%
"Like"?

1442
01:16:15.867 --> 01:16:17.467 line:82%
-"Like"?
-"Like"?

1443
01:16:18.633 --> 01:16:21.300 line:82%
We talked about the songs we liked
when we made song requests.

1444
01:16:21.367 --> 01:16:23.400 line:82%
We went, "I really like this song."

1445
01:16:23.467 --> 01:16:24.967 line:82%
-It's
Starry Night
.
-
Starry Night
.

1446
01:16:25.033 --> 01:16:26.266 line:82%
Lee Moon-sae.

1447
01:16:27.133 --> 01:16:28.500 line:82%
My goodness.

1448
01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:31.300 line:82%
You liked me

1449
01:16:32.367 --> 01:16:33.367 line:82%
You're right.

1450
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.033 line:82%
"I really like it."

1451
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.900 line:82%
Now, I'll explain the final mission.

1452
01:16:39.967 --> 01:16:43.333 line:82%
You must find the suitcase full of drugs
before the husband,

1453
01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.500 line:82%
the drug dealer,

1454
01:16:45.567 --> 01:16:49.567 line:82%
and burn it in the incinerator by 3 p.m.

1455
01:16:49.633 --> 01:16:52.266 line:82%
Then the ordinary residents will win.

1456
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:55.200 line:82%
On the other hand, the husband's objective

1457
01:16:55.266 --> 01:16:59.433 line:82%
is to put the suitcase
in a drum that says "Smuggling out"

1458
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.900 line:82%
and succeed in smuggling out the drug.

1459
01:17:02.967 --> 01:17:04.500 line:82%
Then he will win.

1460
01:17:04.567 --> 01:17:08.533 line:82%
However, only one person can enter
the incineration area at a time.

1461
01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.734 line:82%
So please choose wisely.

1462
01:17:20.033 --> 01:17:21.800 line:82%
I figured it out. Come here.

1463
01:17:21.867 --> 01:17:23.967 line:82%
-It's you.
-Come here.

1464
01:17:24.033 --> 01:17:26.000 line:82%
-Stop it. Come here.
-You…

1465
01:17:26.066 --> 01:17:27.166 line:82%
Who do you think it is?

1466
01:17:27.233 --> 01:17:30.000 line:82%
-Come here.
-It's you, isn't it?

1467
01:17:30.066 --> 01:17:31.367 line:82%
-Come here.
-Hey.

1468
01:17:31.433 --> 01:17:32.500 line:82%
It's one of the four.

1469
01:17:32.567 --> 01:17:34.100 line:82%
-It's Tae-hyun.
-Why?

1470
01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:35.734 line:82%
-It's Tae-hyun.
-Why?

1471
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.900 line:82%
-What did I do?
-Tae-hyun.

1472
01:17:36.967 --> 01:17:38.200 line:82%
I saw everything.

1473
01:17:38.266 --> 01:17:39.900 line:82%
What did I do? What did you see?

1474
01:17:39.967 --> 01:17:42.266 line:82%
The husband accomplished the mission.

1475
01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:43.734 line:82%
-What mission?
-"Like"?

1476
01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.233 line:82%
Hearing "like"
and making physical contact with the wife.

1477
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.100 line:82%
Tae-hyun was the only one.
I saw him hold her hand.

1478
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.100 line:82%
When did he do that?

1479
01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:53.567 line:82%
-I saw him hold her hand.
-When did he do that?

1480
01:17:53.633 --> 01:17:55.033 line:82%
I saw him do this.

1481
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:58.200 line:82%
-He went, "Why are you shaking so much?"
-That's right.

1482
01:17:58.266 --> 01:18:01.000 line:82%
-That's right.
-He did that.

1483
01:18:01.066 --> 01:18:03.500 line:82%
-We got you.
-Today…

1484
01:18:03.567 --> 01:18:06.200 line:82%
Everyone made physical contact
at the
tteokbokki
place.

1485
01:18:06.266 --> 01:18:08.967 line:82%
Everyone made physical contact
at the
tteokbokki
place.

1486
01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.333 line:82%
Excuse me.

1487
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.633 line:82%
Have you seen this man?

1488
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.834 line:82%
Please look at this photo.

1489
01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.000 line:82%
Please come to apartment 101, unit 407.

1490
01:18:21.066 --> 01:18:23.734 line:82%
-She's crying for real.
-She's crying for real.

1491
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.767 line:82%
-Please help me.
-Unit 407.

1492
01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.967 line:82%
See? Why would you corner me like this?

1493
01:18:31.033 --> 01:18:33.066 line:82%
-I mean…
-Is that your antic?

1494
01:18:34.867 --> 01:18:37.233 line:82%
What's important is finding the suitcase.

1495
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.000 line:82%
Yes, we need to find the suitcase.

1496
01:18:39.066 --> 01:18:42.000 line:82%
-What's important is finding the suitcase.
-Okay.

1497
01:18:42.066 --> 01:18:44.667 line:82%
-Where is the suitcase?
-Let's go outside.

1498
01:18:44.734 --> 01:18:47.834 line:82%
Staying in the apartment
won't get us anywhere.

1499
01:18:49.734 --> 01:18:51.767 line:82%
Are we running again?

1500
01:18:51.834 --> 01:18:53.367 line:82%
We don't know where to go.

1501
01:18:53.433 --> 01:18:55.900 line:82%
Where are we going? We should know that.

1502
01:18:55.967 --> 01:18:58.934 line:82%
Where is everyone going?

1503
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.500 line:82%
I don't know either.

1504
01:19:00.567 --> 01:19:02.633 line:82%
I don't know where I'm going.

1505
01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:06.467 line:82%
-You and I aren't the husband.
-We aren't the husband.

1506
01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:09.500 line:82%
It'd be nice for us to search together.

1507
01:19:09.567 --> 01:19:11.867 line:82%
Where should we go?

1508
01:19:11.934 --> 01:19:13.900 line:82%
Grade Three, Class Two, Number Five?

1509
01:19:19.467 --> 01:19:22.233 line:82%
Is that a unit number?

1510
01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.100 line:82%
Grade Three. The third floor.

1511
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.200 line:82%
Where would it be?

1512
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:32.166 line:82%
I think we should go to the first floor.

1513
01:19:32.233 --> 01:19:34.867 line:82%
Today, I'll be the guard.

1514
01:19:37.367 --> 01:19:39.633 line:82%
-It's too hard.
-Yes.

1515
01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.467 line:82%
Where did the suitcase come from?

1516
01:19:41.533 --> 01:19:43.633 line:82%
How many tapes did you have?

1517
01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:44.934 line:82%
Two.

1518
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.700 line:82%
It makes no sense.

1519
01:19:46.767 --> 01:19:50.000 line:82%
It looks like both teams received
the same hints.

1520
01:19:50.066 --> 01:19:50.934 line:82%
That's right.

1521
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.300 line:82%
Usually, the winning team gets
something else.

1522
01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.433 line:82%
-The Yus.
-My goodness.

1523
01:19:59.567 --> 01:20:00.834 line:82%
-Just the three of us?
-Yes.

1524
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.333 line:82%
Give it to us.

1525
01:20:03.433 --> 01:20:05.000 line:82%
Is it "Bath"?

1526
01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:07.633 line:82%
Put it inside. The sole of the foot.

1527
01:20:09.166 --> 01:20:12.266 line:82%
How did the winning team get
the same hints as the losing team?

1528
01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.100 line:82%
It makes no sense.

1529
01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:19.166 line:82%
Were there only two tapes in the bag?

1530
01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:22.033 line:82%
-There was something else, right?
-I didn't see.

1531
01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.467 line:82%
-Tae-hyun.
-Anyone…

1532
01:20:23.533 --> 01:20:27.300 line:82%
-JENNIE. The Chas, come here.
-The Chas will have a meeting.

1533
01:20:27.367 --> 01:20:29.166 line:82%
What could it be?

1534
01:20:29.233 --> 01:20:31.333 line:82%
Grade Three, Class Two, Number Five.

1535
01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.433 line:82%
Grade Three, Class Two, Number 19.

1536
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.700 line:82%
So 325 and 3219.

1537
01:20:34.767 --> 01:20:36.300 line:82%
-Everyone suspects me.
-I won't.

1538
01:20:36.367 --> 01:20:38.934 line:82%
But you didn't hide a hint, did you?

1539
01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:41.100 line:82%
-No.
-No?

1540
01:20:41.166 --> 01:20:42.266 line:82%
Then what?

1541
01:20:42.333 --> 01:20:44.033 line:82%
What are you?

1542
01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:47.333 line:82%
You know something, don't you?

1543
01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.600 line:82%
Are you wearing a necklace?

1544
01:20:50.667 --> 01:20:52.900 line:82%
-A necklace?
-Can I feel your chest?

1545
01:20:52.967 --> 01:20:54.633 line:82%
-He doesn't have it.
-What necklace?

1546
01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:56.100 line:82%
Can I feel your chest?

1547
01:20:56.166 --> 01:20:57.333 line:82%
-He doesn't have it.
-What necklace?

1548
01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.700 line:82%
-The other half.
-See?

1549
01:20:58.767 --> 01:21:00.800 line:82%
What? What's the hint?

1550
01:21:00.867 --> 01:21:03.200 line:82%
-What?
-That woman had…

1551
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.033 line:82%
Please come to apartment 101, unit 407.

1552
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.133 line:82%
I must find him.

1553
01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.066 line:82%
-She's wearing a half-heart necklace.
-A half-heart necklace?

1554
01:21:13.133 --> 01:21:15.100 line:82%
A half-heart necklace.

1555
01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:16.800 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Is he her husband?

1556
01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.233 line:82%
Seriously, I…

1557
01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.600 line:82%
-Come here.
-There's something.

1558
01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:31.667 line:82%
Well…

1559
01:21:33.066 --> 01:21:35.467 line:82%
I'm only sharing it with you guys.

1560
01:21:35.533 --> 01:21:37.800 line:82%
I'll show you that it's definitely not me.

1561
01:21:37.867 --> 01:21:38.967 line:82%
-Okay?
-Okay.

1562
01:21:39.033 --> 01:21:40.567 line:82%
Are you taking us somewhere?

1563
01:21:40.633 --> 01:21:42.533 line:82%
I'm taking you somewhere.

1564
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.033 line:82%
What? Tae-hyun.

1565
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.500 line:82%
He has something. A key.

1566
01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.900 line:82%
-Trust me. It really isn't me.
-Tae-hyun.

1567
01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:54.767 line:82%
We get two each.

1568
01:21:54.834 --> 01:21:55.900 line:82%
What's inside?

1569
01:21:55.967 --> 01:21:57.467 line:82%
It's so hard.

1570
01:21:58.467 --> 01:22:01.400 line:82%
-It was really tasty.
-Why am I so drowsy?

1571
01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:20.400 line:82%
-It really isn't me.
-Tae-hyun. Why did you hide it?

1572
01:22:20.467 --> 01:22:21.467 line:82%
What?

1573
01:22:21.533 --> 01:22:23.967 line:82%
-I didn't know who it was.
-Let's hurry up.

1574
01:22:24.033 --> 01:22:27.400 line:82%
-Right.
-I'm certain it's Jung-ha.

1575
01:22:27.467 --> 01:22:28.467 line:82%
Jung-ha?

1576
01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.400 line:82%
-I found him suspicious all along.
-Okay.

1577
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:40.433 line:82%
I'm sharing this clue
because I'm certain it's Jung-ha.

1578
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.166 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-Why?

1579
01:22:42.233 --> 01:22:43.767 line:82%
-It was a force of habit.
-Right.

1580
01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.066 line:82%
-You know what I mean.
-Yes.

1581
01:22:45.133 --> 01:22:47.433 line:82%
-It's a habit.
-It's understandable.

1582
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.934 line:82%
I would've taken it too.
It's obviously the best clue.

1583
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.166 line:82%
You know what I mean.

1584
01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:53.266 line:82%
I…

1585
01:22:56.934 --> 01:22:58.367 line:82%
How did you know?

1586
01:22:58.433 --> 01:23:00.433 line:82%
-Gosh.
-The unit number is on the key.

1587
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.700 line:82%
-Gosh.
-The unit number is on the key.

1588
01:23:02.767 --> 01:23:05.266 line:82%
-It's the drug factory.
-This is it.

1589
01:23:06.266 --> 01:23:09.567 line:82%
The ones who got caught making and selling
large quantities of drugs…

1590
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.300 line:82%
married couple…

1591
01:23:11.367 --> 01:23:16.367 line:82%
had a secret factory set up
inside the apartment.

1592
01:23:29.066 --> 01:23:32.467 line:82%
The amount of meth they made
is equivalent to 7,300,000 doses

1593
01:23:32.533 --> 01:23:35.066 line:82%
and worth over 150 billion won.

1594
01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:42.734 line:82%
-This is unbelievable.
-My goodness.

1595
01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.100 line:82%
This is unbelievable.

1596
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.367 line:82%
Isn't that Jung-ha?

1597
01:23:48.867 --> 01:23:50.300 line:82%
Isn't that Jung-ha?

1598
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:17.066 line:82%
Look at this.

1599
01:24:18.266 --> 01:24:20.567 line:82%
-Grade Three, Class Two… Hey.
-The suitcase…

1600
01:24:20.633 --> 01:24:23.433 line:82%
-Grade Three, Class Two… Hey.
-The suitcase…

1601
01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:34.867 line:82%
-It was…
-Grade Three, Class Two, Number Five.

1602
01:24:34.934 --> 01:24:36.333 line:82%
-Grade Three, Class Two, Number 19.
-And?

1603
01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.934 line:82%
-Number 19.
-Is that right?

1604
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000 line:82%
Yes.

1605
01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.600 line:82%
Kim Sang-ah.

1606
01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:43.667 line:82%
-Choi Geum-ja?
-Choi Geum-ja?

1607
01:24:54.133 --> 01:24:56.100 line:82%
"Where"?

1608
01:24:56.166 --> 01:24:58.500 line:82%
Kim Sang-ah. Choi Geum-ja.

1609
01:24:58.567 --> 01:25:00.433 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-Kim Sang-ah.

1610
01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.066 line:82%
The suitcase should be here. Where is it?

1611
01:25:10.834 --> 01:25:12.900 line:82%
He's definitely young.

1612
01:25:12.967 --> 01:25:14.400 line:82%
Jung-ha.

1613
01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.166 line:82%
Yes?

1614
01:25:19.734 --> 01:25:21.867 line:82%
What? That unit is strange.

1615
01:25:21.934 --> 01:25:22.967 line:82%
Na-ra.

1616
01:25:25.433 --> 01:25:27.266 line:82%
Go to the fifth floor.

1617
01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:28.800 line:82%
What? A camera is set up.

1618
01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:41.734 line:82%
-When did you guys come here?
-You startled me.

1619
01:25:42.467 --> 01:25:43.633 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

1620
01:25:44.133 --> 01:25:46.834 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Such a place existed.

1621
01:25:51.834 --> 01:25:53.000 line:82%
It isn't me.

1622
01:25:53.066 --> 01:25:55.300 line:82%
How did you find it? Is this it?

1623
01:25:55.367 --> 01:25:57.867 line:82%
-Grade Three…
-Class Two, Number Five.

1624
01:25:57.934 --> 01:25:59.834 line:82%
Who are Kim Sang-ah and Choi Geum-ja?

1625
01:26:02.934 --> 01:26:04.600 line:82%
You guys had something else.

1626
01:26:04.667 --> 01:26:06.800 line:82%
I spotted it and set it aside.

1627
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.133 line:82%
Where are you going?

1628
01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:17.400 line:82%
Where are you going?
See? Jung-ha is leaving.

1629
01:26:17.467 --> 01:26:19.367 line:82%
Jung-ha is leaving, everyone.

1630
01:26:19.433 --> 01:26:21.600 line:82%
-Stay by his side.
-I'll do that.

1631
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.533 line:82%
-This is a clue for "where."
-I know.

1632
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.400 line:82%
-Number 5 is Kim Sang-ah.
-Number 19 is--

1633
01:26:31.467 --> 01:26:32.800 line:82%
Choi Geum-ja.

1634
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.567 line:82%
Where did Tae-hyun go?

1635
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.667 line:82%
He went somewhere.

1636
01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.100 line:82%
Where did Tae-hyun go?

1637
01:26:46.934 --> 01:26:49.734 line:82%
Jae-seok. For goodness' sake.

1638
01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.934 line:82%
Sang-ah Top, Geum-ja Top.

1639
01:27:03.266 --> 01:27:05.200 line:82%
Sang-ah Top, Geum-ja Top.

1640
01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:20.100 line:82%
Sang-ah Top, Geum-ja Top.

1641
01:27:20.166 --> 01:27:22.200 line:82%
It's the rooftop.

1642
01:27:31.567 --> 01:27:34.266 line:82%
So I hid the drug suitcase…
in a secret place.

1643
01:27:38.533 --> 01:27:39.734 line:82%
-Se-chan.
-Yes?

1644
01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.867 line:82%
-Where are you?
-Jae-seok went up.

1645
01:27:41.934 --> 01:27:43.667 line:82%
-Up?
-I think he found it.

1646
01:27:43.734 --> 01:27:45.266 line:82%
-You think he found it.
-Yes.

1647
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.600 line:82%
I spotted it and set it aside.

1648
01:28:14.033 --> 01:28:16.300 line:82%
Where are you going?
See? Jung-ha is leaving.

1649
01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.400 line:82%
See?

1650
01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.233 line:82%
-He found it!
-What?

1651
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.333 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-What?

1652
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.500 line:82%
-Where?
-See?

1653
01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:43.033 line:82%
-It's him.
-I found it.

1654
01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.133 line:82%
It's him.

1655
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.433 line:82%
Na-ra, it isn't me. It's Tae-hyun.

1656
01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.133 line:82%
-What is he saying?
-Seriously.

1657
01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.333 line:82%
It was here when I got here.

1658
01:28:50.934 --> 01:28:52.900 line:82%
Which one of you is it?

1659
01:28:52.967 --> 01:28:55.166 line:82%
Na-ra, let me make it clear.

1660
01:28:55.233 --> 01:28:57.600 line:82%
-All along…
-You've behaved strangely.

1661
01:28:57.667 --> 01:28:59.233 line:82%
I thought he was behaving strangely.

1662
01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.433 line:82%
I'll go downstairs with Na-ra.

1663
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.100 line:82%
Do that. Okay. For goodness' sake.

1664
01:29:03.166 --> 01:29:04.934 line:82%
-What's going on?
-It isn't me.

1665
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.100 line:82%
Hold on to Tae-hyun.

1666
01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:07.633 line:82%
See? It's him.

1667
01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.433 line:82%
-I'll grab the suitcase.
-Together.

1668
01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:10.967 line:82%
-Come on.
-I'll grab the suitcase.

1669
01:29:11.033 --> 01:29:12.834 line:82%
-Okay.
-We're carrying it together.

1670
01:29:18.867 --> 01:29:21.266 line:82%
I can't believe that punk.

1671
01:29:21.333 --> 01:29:23.166 line:82%
-What did he say?
-What?

1672
01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:26.367 line:82%
For goodness' sake. This is frustrating.

1673
01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:28.734 line:82%
Come this way.

1674
01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.133 line:82%
Come this way.

1675
01:29:33.333 --> 01:29:35.500 line:82%
Gosh, they're running away.

1676
01:29:36.667 --> 01:29:38.867 line:82%
-Hey.
-Na-ra, follow me.

1677
01:29:40.133 --> 01:29:42.533 line:82%
Hey, you punk!

1678
01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.567 line:82%
Was it you?

1679
01:29:45.433 --> 01:29:46.533 line:82%
Hey, you punk!

1680
01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.300 line:82%
Jung-ha took it.

1681
01:29:51.367 --> 01:29:53.333 line:82%
-This is driving me crazy.
-Where is he?

1682
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.300 line:82%
Where is he? Sang-ah Top, Geum-ja Top.

1683
01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.467 line:82%
Tae-hyun will follow us.

1684
01:30:03.533 --> 01:30:05.333 line:82%
-You…
-It isn't me.

1685
01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.934 line:82%
-What was that?
-Hide.

1686
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.867 line:82%
-What was that?
-Hide.

1687
01:30:08.934 --> 01:30:10.567 line:82%
This is driving me crazy.

1688
01:30:10.633 --> 01:30:13.200 line:82%
Hide so that they can't find us.

1689
01:30:13.266 --> 01:30:14.734 line:82%
It was at the rooftop, right?

1690
01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.633 line:82%
-Jae-seok, Jung-ha drives me insane.
-What?

1691
01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.667 line:82%
Na-ra fell for his antics.

1692
01:30:19.734 --> 01:30:22.100 line:82%
-How did he know?
-We need to catch him.

1693
01:30:22.166 --> 01:30:25.533 line:82%
-Did he take it?
-Jung-ha took it.

1694
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.333 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1695
01:30:27.934 --> 01:30:29.867 line:82%
I figured it out too late.

1696
01:30:30.767 --> 01:30:32.500 line:82%
Let's go together.

1697
01:30:33.166 --> 01:30:35.367 line:82%
Let's go together.

1698
01:30:35.433 --> 01:30:37.600 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-We should duck.

1699
01:30:38.367 --> 01:30:40.200 line:82%
Lure them, okay?

1700
01:30:42.934 --> 01:30:46.166 line:82%
I shouldn't lure them.
I'm suspicious of you too.

1701
01:30:49.667 --> 01:30:51.433 line:82%
-What?
-Hey.

1702
01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:54.233 line:82%
-Jung-ha took it.
-Where is it?

1703
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.600 line:82%
Jung-ha found it.

1704
01:30:55.667 --> 01:30:57.600 line:82%
Jung-ha found it?

1705
01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.400 line:82%
Why is no one suspecting Jung-ha?
This is so frustrating.

1706
01:31:03.467 --> 01:31:05.934 line:82%
-I'm suspicious of Na-ra too.
-What?

1707
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.867 line:82%
The husband could be a woman.

1708
01:31:07.934 --> 01:31:09.533 line:82%
It could be a trap.

1709
01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.233 line:82%
Let's go together. Let go.

1710
01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.233 line:82%
No. Why would I let go?
Let's carry it together.

1711
01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:16.734 line:82%
-Okay.
-Together.

1712
01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:25.800 line:82%
Where will we find Jung-ha?

1713
01:31:25.867 --> 01:31:29.100 line:82%
-Na-ra isn't around.
-She's with him.

1714
01:31:40.166 --> 01:31:43.100 line:82%
There are no such rules.

1715
01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:45.133 line:82%
There are no such rules.

1716
01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.333 line:82%
Did Jung-ha find the suitcase?

1717
01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.600 line:82%
-Jung-ha found it.
-This is ridiculous.

1718
01:31:50.266 --> 01:31:53.967 line:82%
-It should've been here.
-By the way, why is there hot water?

1719
01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:57.200 line:82%
…why is there hot water?

1720
01:32:04.767 --> 01:32:06.500 line:82%
-Pour it.
-Okay.

1721
01:32:06.567 --> 01:32:08.133 line:82%
-See if words come out.
-Tea.

1722
01:32:14.867 --> 01:32:16.467 line:82%
A picture is starting to appear.

1723
01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:19.567 line:82%
A picture is starting to appear.

1724
01:32:25.266 --> 01:32:27.367 line:82%
-There are no such rules. No.
-Come on.

1725
01:32:27.433 --> 01:32:29.066 line:82%
Come here.

1726
01:32:29.133 --> 01:32:32.133 line:82%
-There are no such rules.
-We can't let Tae-hyun have it. Run.

1727
01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:34.800 line:82%
-Come here.
-Hurry up.

1728
01:32:34.867 --> 01:32:37.166 line:82%
Let go.

1729
01:32:41.533 --> 01:32:43.767 line:82%
Come here.

1730
01:32:44.333 --> 01:32:45.533 line:82%
Hey!

1731
01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:48.567 line:82%
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1732
01:32:48.633 --> 01:32:49.633 line:82%
Hey!

1733
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.133 line:82%
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1734
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.934 line:82%
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1735
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.667 line:82%
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1736
01:32:58.734 --> 01:33:01.800 line:82%
Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1737
01:33:04.533 --> 01:33:06.600 line:82%
A picture is starting to appear.

1738
01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:10.700 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Na-ra, we need to catch Jung-ha.

1739
01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:14.266 line:82%
Na-ra, catch Jung-ha.

1740
01:33:14.333 --> 01:33:16.233 line:82%
-Na-ra, take it.
-Na-ra, catch Jung-ha.

1741
01:33:21.867 --> 01:33:23.900 line:82%
-Come on!
-Na-ra!

1742
01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:28.867 line:82%
-Come on!
-Na-ra!

1743
01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.567 line:82%
-Come on!
-Na-ra!

1744
01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.667 line:82%
If we're looking for the husband,
it isn't a woman.

1745
01:33:45.433 --> 01:33:47.567 line:82%
Tae-hyun.

1746
01:33:47.633 --> 01:33:49.967 line:82%
-You suspected two people.
-You're a bit strange today.

1747
01:33:50.033 --> 01:33:53.200 line:82%
Are you suspecting me now?

1748
01:33:53.266 --> 01:33:56.066 line:82%
You're using your acting voice today.
You're a bit off.

1749
01:34:01.533 --> 01:34:05.300 line:82%
-Jae-seok or you.
-The one who's it stays the quietest.

1750
01:34:05.367 --> 01:34:06.667 line:82%
-Was I quiet today?
-Yes.

1751
01:34:07.633 --> 01:34:09.867 line:82%
You were much quieter than usual.

1752
01:34:09.934 --> 01:34:11.467 line:82%
Why did you hide it?

1753
01:34:11.533 --> 01:34:14.834 line:82%
-I didn't know who it was.
-Let's hurry up.

1754
01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.934 line:82%
-Come on!
-Na-ra!

1755
01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.934 line:82%
It was Tae-hyun?

1756
01:34:34.967 --> 01:34:36.800 line:82%
Come on!

1757
01:34:45.266 --> 01:34:49.233 line:82%
-The residents won.
-Okay.

1758
01:34:50.333 --> 01:34:51.367 line:82%
Hey.

1759
01:34:56.967 --> 01:34:58.300 line:82%
I must find him.

1760
01:34:58.367 --> 01:35:00.467 line:82%
Please look at this photo.

1761
01:35:02.367 --> 01:35:04.667 line:82%
-She's crying for real.
-Please look at this photo.

1762
01:35:04.734 --> 01:35:07.667 line:82%
-Let me see it.
-Please look at this photo.

1763
01:35:10.066 --> 01:35:14.300 line:82%
Please look at this photo.

1764
01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:20.667 line:82%
-Come on out.
-Okay.

1765
01:35:20.734 --> 01:35:22.600 line:82%
Hurry up and come on out.

1766
01:35:22.667 --> 01:35:23.867 line:82%
What was that?

1767
01:35:23.934 --> 01:35:25.000 line:82%
Tae-hyun.

1768
01:35:25.066 --> 01:35:27.100 line:82%
-Hurry up.
-I mean…

1769
01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.967 line:82%
"Check the mailbox of unit 407."

1770
01:35:31.967 --> 01:35:35.800 line:82%
Bring one staff member at a time.

1771
01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:40.000 line:82%
He might be downstairs.
I need to bring him.

1772
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:52.100 line:82%
"You're the husband of the married couple
that has been selling drugs."

1773
01:35:57.934 --> 01:36:00.467 line:82%
"Without letting the members know,

1774
01:36:00.533 --> 01:36:03.367 line:82%
complete the following missions.

1775
01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:07.433 line:82%
Wear the couple necklace you exchanged
with your wife at the wedding

1776
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.967 line:82%
until the end of the mission.

1777
01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.600 line:82%
Whenever you meet your beloved wife,

1778
01:36:15.667 --> 01:36:17.200 line:82%
hold her hands."

1779
01:36:17.266 --> 01:36:19.900 line:82%
-What's wrong?
-You should tell us.

1780
01:36:21.367 --> 01:36:23.734 line:82%
"Hear 'like' from all the members

1781
01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.333 line:82%
except for yourself."

1782
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.500 line:82%
-March?
-A retreat?

1783
01:36:28.567 --> 01:36:30.300 line:82%
I really like the idea. When can we go?

1784
01:36:30.367 --> 01:36:31.734 line:82%
I'd really like it.

1785
01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.734 line:82%
If my second child plays the guitar…

1786
01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.834 line:82%
I like the guitar.

1787
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:37.500 line:82%
Go ahead. I like the idea.

1788
01:36:37.567 --> 01:36:39.367 line:82%
-What do you think?
-I like the idea.

1789
01:36:43.066 --> 01:36:45.567 line:82%
-It was so hard.
-I can only imagine.

1790
01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:48.233 line:82%
There were so many missions.

1791
01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:49.767 line:82%
Hey, you worked hard.

1792
01:36:49.834 --> 01:36:51.600 line:82%
There were so many missions.

1793
01:36:51.667 --> 01:36:53.967 line:82%
What did you say about
my child learning the guitar?

1794
01:36:54.033 --> 01:36:55.200 line:82%
-"Like."
-"Like."

1795
01:36:55.266 --> 01:36:56.834 line:82%
-"I like the idea."
-Yes.

1796
01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:58.333 line:82%
-I see.
-I see.

1797
01:36:58.967 --> 01:37:01.400 line:82%
-I see.
-My goodness.

1798
01:37:01.467 --> 01:37:04.000 line:82%
You didn't mean what you said?

1799
01:37:04.066 --> 01:37:05.734 line:82%
-Was it fake?
-It was fake.

1800
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.133 line:82%
I had no idea.

1801
01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.667 line:82%
-And JENNIE was unbelievable.
-Why?

1802
01:37:09.734 --> 01:37:13.467 line:82%
She spotted the woman's necklace
right away.

1803
01:37:13.533 --> 01:37:16.567 line:82%
So instead of wearing it around my neck,
I put it here.

1804
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.800 line:82%
-I wore it here for a long while.
-Really?

1805
01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:22.233 line:82%
That was incredible.

1806
01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.000 line:82%
The missions were so hard.

1807
01:37:24.066 --> 01:37:26.166 line:82%
Toward the end,
what were those baby photos?

1808
01:37:26.233 --> 01:37:29.233 line:82%
We merged the woman's face
and Tae-hyun's face.

1809
01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:30.967 line:82%
As soon as I saw the photos,

1810
01:37:31.033 --> 01:37:33.900 line:82%
-I thought, "The faces got merged well."
-No way.

1811
01:37:33.967 --> 01:37:35.300 line:82%
They looked like me.

1812
01:37:35.367 --> 01:37:37.200 line:82%
We won!

1813
01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.700 line:82%
The biggest meth cartel in Korea
got caught by the prosecution.

1814
01:37:45.767 --> 01:37:47.834 line:82%
Drug cases are increasing.

1815
01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:52.066 line:82%
Drug use is spreading
among students and all classes of society.

1816
01:37:52.133 --> 01:37:54.133 line:82%
Drugs that ruin people's lives

1817
01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.233 line:82%
are now spreading among ordinary citizens

1818
01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.667 line:82%
such as office workers and housewives.

1819
01:37:58.734 --> 01:38:03.333 line:82%
Korea is no longer a nation
that is safe from drugs.

1820
01:38:10.667 --> 01:38:13.500 line:82%
-
A university, not an apartment?
-
So it's 2011.

1821
01:38:13.567 --> 01:38:16.433 line:82%
-
A freshmen welcome party?
-
They're welcoming us.

1822
01:38:17.333 --> 01:38:18.800 line:82%
-
Renaissance
-
Renaissance

1823
01:38:18.867 --> 01:38:20.266 line:82%
-
The way young people move…
-
It's different.

1824
01:38:23.633 --> 01:38:26.400 line:82%
I'm in here!

1825
01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:29.200 line:82%
-Is that about unemployment?
-The tuition…

1826
01:38:29.266 --> 01:38:30.800 line:82%
What are you drawing?

1827
01:38:30.867 --> 01:38:32.066 line:82%
My future.

1828
01:38:32.133 --> 01:38:35.033 line:82%
What happened in 2011? At the university?

1829
01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.633 line:82%
Catch him!

1830
01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:38.867 line:82%
It's getting bigger and bigger.
What are you going to do?

1831
01:38:38.934 --> 01:38:41.066 line:82%
I'll show you how to take over the school.

1832
01:38:41.133 --> 01:38:43.734 line:82%
We have to check out your skills.

1833
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.967 line:82%
-
We can do it too.
-
Here!

1834
01:38:46.033 --> 01:38:46.934 line:82%
-
Come on, JENNIE.
-
Let's go.

1835
01:38:48.266 --> 01:38:50.400 line:82%
Help me!

1836
