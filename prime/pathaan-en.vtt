5TH AUGUST 2019
LAHORE, PAKISTAN

2
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.670 line:82%
What are you looking at?
It's cancer.

3
00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:02.600 line:82%
Not some pretty girl's
Instagram page.

4
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.377 line:82%
How long have I got?

5
00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:07.921 line:82%
Three years.

6
00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:10.547 line:82%
Maybe.

7
00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:16.102 line:82%
The Indian government has made
the shocking decision today

8
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.258 line:82%
to revoke Kashmir's special status.

9
00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:23.456 line:82%
The Indian Parliament has unilaterally
announced Article 370 is abrogated.

10
00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:27.437 line:82%
Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Office has
condemned this unilateral action and said

11
00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:31.614 line:82%
that Pakistan will weigh up all
options and give a befitting response.

12
00:01:31.822 --> 00:01:33.480 line:82%
Article 370 canceled.

13
00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:36.662 line:82%
How can India do that?
This is wrong, sir.

14
00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.515 line:82%
This is not wrong.

15
00:01:39.687 --> 00:01:41.230 line:82%
It's a declaration of war.

16
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:44.539 line:82%
You said three years, right?

17
00:01:50.388 --> 00:01:51.781 line:82%
It's long enough.

18
00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:55.352 line:82%
Time for diplomacy has passed, sir.

19
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.693 line:82%
If we wait for the UN resolution,

20
00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:01.486 line:82%
then India will take control
of our Azad Kashmir next.

21
00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:05.327 line:82%
A man of God cannot challenge them.

22
00:02:07.772 --> 00:02:11.105 line:82%
It's time to befriend the Devil.

23
00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:20.223 line:82%
Jim.

24
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.687 line:82%
General Qadir for you.

25
00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.056 line:82%
General Qadir, all in order?

26
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.058 line:82%
Don't want order,
I want chaos.

27
00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:30.597 line:82%
What do you want?

28
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.531 line:82%
To bring India to its knees.

29
00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:34.546 line:82%
You sure?

30
00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:39.549 line:82%
Once that bullet is fired,
it won't go back into the gun.

31
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.460 line:82%
You need to be sure.
Can you do it?

32
00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:45.930 line:82%
It'll take time,
but it can be done.

33
00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:55.525 line:82%
3 YEARS LATER

34
00:02:55.993 --> 00:02:59.010 line:82%
SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA

35
00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:21.745 line:82%
A radar can't detect it,
no signal can stop it.

36
00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.138 line:82%
It fears nothing, nor can it be
reasoned with.

37
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.216 line:82%
Once it's launched,
it's like a djinn from Hell.

38
00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:33.131 line:82%
Countdown to Judgement Day starts.

39
00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:37.080 line:82%
Good. Jim will let you know
where to deliver it.

40
00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.559 line:82%
Why? Doesn't he trust you?

41
00:03:39.778 --> 00:03:41.212 line:82%
Jim?

42
00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:47.439 line:82%
If God asked him to name
anything he wanted,

43
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.789 line:82%
he'd say, "Are You playing
a trick on me"?

44
00:03:52.147 --> 00:03:55.053 line:82%
Jim keeps his cards
close to his chest.

45
00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:58.983 line:82%
Boss, is this man "Raafe"?

46
00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.376 line:82%
Why?

47
00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:03.433 line:82%
One man come.
He asked for Raafe.

48
00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:05.486 line:82%
We say don't know Raafe.

49
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.573 line:82%
He say Raafe come to see Fayyad.

50
00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:08.938 line:82%
Where is he?

51
00:04:09.403 --> 00:04:12.423 line:82%
VIP area, getting special treatment.

52
00:04:51.413 --> 00:04:53.116 line:82%
Who are you?

53
00:04:53.802 --> 00:04:55.643 line:82%
Hey, Hindi.

54
00:04:57.321 --> 00:04:58.457 line:82%
Speak up!

55
00:04:59.024 --> 00:05:00.686 line:82%
Talk in Hindi!

56
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:03.560 line:82%
No fun swearing at you in Arabic.

57
00:05:05.964 --> 00:05:08.502 line:82%
You'll take 5 seconds
to be surprised.

58
00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:13.699 line:82%
5 seconds to wonder where
you've heard this voice.

59
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:18.185 line:82%
And 5 more seconds
to get over your disbelief.

60
00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:24.488 line:82%
Then you'll ask,

61
00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.597 line:82%
"Pathaan? You?"

62
00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:35.267 line:82%
Still alive.

63
00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:40.311 line:82%
Where is she?

64
00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:44.776 line:82%
How did you survive?

65
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:47.619 line:82%
Answer my question first.

66
00:05:48.652 --> 00:05:50.444 line:82%
Where is Rubai?

67
00:05:52.632 --> 00:05:56.244 line:82%
Uff! Mr. Pathaan has a broken heart.

68
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.056 line:82%
Love and perfume cannot be concealed.

69
00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:04.151 line:82%
She's far from your reach.

70
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.993 line:82%
Now you'll be going far away too.

71
00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:13.279 line:82%
Any last message?

72
00:06:14.213 --> 00:06:16.417 line:82%
I have a gift for her.

73
00:06:20.917 --> 00:06:24.026 line:82%
Your dancing bells are undone, Raafe.
So dance!

74
00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.449 line:82%
Kill him!

75
00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:50.576 line:82%
What are you waiting for?

76
00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:56.065 line:82%
When all the world is burning
and fearing all the time

77
00:06:57.338 --> 00:07:02.190 line:82%
Crying every breath out loud for help
but there's no one around

78
00:07:03.577 --> 00:07:08.710 line:82%
Looking in the gloomy face of bleak
and darkness everywhere

79
00:07:10.198 --> 00:07:14.859 line:82%
Losing all hope and faith...
But, there's no one to dare

80
00:07:15.663 --> 00:07:21.131 line:82%
Rises an Arrow to burn the evil,
and set the order right

81
00:07:21.806 --> 00:07:27.932 line:82%
He strikes a blow, he fights alone
Shining so bright he's the knight

82
00:07:47.352 --> 00:07:48.181 line:82%
Kill him.

83
00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:31.812 line:82%
There's a storm coming, Raafe.

84
00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:33.936 line:82%
Fasten your seat belt.

85
00:08:49.477 --> 00:08:50.671 line:82%
Closed the door!

86
00:09:11.506 --> 00:09:12.676 line:82%
Sorry, Raafe.

87
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:44.931 line:82%

I'm on my way, Barun.

92
00:10:05.656 --> 00:10:08.287 line:82%
If you go on about the cake,
how can I finish my work?

93
00:10:08.513 --> 00:10:10.565 line:82%
Light the candles.
Start singing "Happy Birthday",

94
00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:12.612 line:82%
and I'll be home before
the candles go out.

95
00:10:12.802 --> 00:10:15.497 line:82%
Ma'am, I've got all the information.
And it seems there's no problem.

96
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:17.058 line:82%
Yeah. Check again.

97
00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.407 line:82%
I need all the information now.
Run it past the Finance Ministry.

98
00:10:19.929 --> 00:10:21.351 line:82%
Ma'am?

99
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.864 line:82%
We have a red flag.

100
00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:26.504 line:82%
Our scanner has just identified someone.

101
00:10:26.723 --> 00:10:27.930 line:82%
Who is it?

102
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.874 line:82%
Rubai?

103
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.616 line:82%
Where?

104
00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:41.936 line:82%
Paris. A security camera
at Palais Royal metro station.

105
00:10:42.293 --> 00:10:44.374 line:82%
- When?
- 15 minutes ago, max.

106
00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:46.421 line:82%
Get a team on it right away.

107
00:10:46.631 --> 00:10:48.318 line:82%
Keep eyes on her.
Do not intercept.

108
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.571 line:82%
Get a plane.

109
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:06.951 line:82%
Use the blue channel. We need
permission for immediate take-off.

110
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.451 line:82%
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.530 line:82%
And yes, tell Barun...

112
00:11:10.818 --> 00:11:13.285 line:82%
...to keep you a slice of cake
in the fridge.

113
00:11:25.054 --> 00:11:26.155 line:82%
How much longer?

114
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.174 line:82%
5 hours, max.

115
00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:33.624 line:82%
- Ma'am?
- Hmm?

116
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.732 line:82%
Ma'am, are we going after Pathaan?

117
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.653 line:82%
What do you know
about Pathaan?

118
00:11:46.237 --> 00:11:47.726 line:82%
Not much, ma'am.

119
00:11:48.118 --> 00:11:52.659 line:82%
Whenever he's mentioned,
everyone gets uncomfortable.

120
00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:55.162 line:82%
They change the subject.

121
00:11:56.992 --> 00:11:59.845 line:82%
Ma'am...is he on our side?

122
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.859 line:82%
He was once.

123
00:12:03.707 --> 00:12:07.694 line:82%
Not just on our side,
he was our centre-forward.

124
00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:11.582 line:82%
Opening batsman, opening bowler,

125
00:12:12.313 --> 00:12:14.300 line:82%
wicketkeeper and four slip
fielder too.

126
00:12:15.522 --> 00:12:18.323 line:82%
You know, if it weren't for Pathaan,

127
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.900 line:82%
we would not be doing
what we do.

128
00:12:23.506 --> 00:12:25.664 line:82%
Nor would the JOCR Department exist.

129
00:12:27.245 --> 00:12:29.928 line:82%
Two years ago, during
a Myanmar mission,

130
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.445 line:82%
Pathaan got badly injured.

131
00:12:32.766 --> 00:12:36.899 line:82%
He lay in a hospital for weeks.
It was touch and go.

132
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:42.097 line:82%
Everyone believed the Pathaan
chapter was closed.

133
00:12:43.294 --> 00:12:45.593 line:82%
We didn't realise

134
00:12:46.438 --> 00:12:48.733 line:82%
he was writing a whole new book.

135
00:12:50.617 --> 00:12:53.309 line:82%
INDIAN MILITARY HOSPITAL, NEW DELHI
02 YEARS EARLIER

136
00:13:07.647 --> 00:13:09.527 line:82%
I heard you got badly hurt.

137
00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.370 line:82%
Ma'am, yes.

138
00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:16.374 line:82%
I have a metal plate in my foot,
a titanium disc in my neck,

139
00:13:16.744 --> 00:13:19.490 line:82%
and bio-absorbable screws
in my shoulder.

140
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.138 line:82%
But you look very well.

141
00:13:23.563 --> 00:13:26.998 line:82%
It's tough. My body goes beep, beep,
beep at airport security.

142
00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:28.830 line:82%
They keep detecting metal.

143
00:13:29.696 --> 00:13:31.648 line:82%
Looks like retirement
doesn't suit you.

144
00:13:32.552 --> 00:13:33.652 line:82%
Why?

145
00:13:34.422 --> 00:13:36.444 line:82%
Retirement can be peaceful, Pathaan.

146
00:13:36.677 --> 00:13:40.537 line:82%
There are so many ways
to spend one's time.

147
00:13:41.017 --> 00:13:44.721 line:82%
Tomorrow we could be a MasterChef
and Indian Idol the next day.

148
00:13:45.735 --> 00:13:48.219 line:82%
You need to get a hobby, Pathaan.

149
00:13:49.174 --> 00:13:52.116 line:82%
Found it. "Kintsugi".

150
00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:54.065 line:82%
Is that Punjabi?

151
00:13:55.994 --> 00:13:59.033 line:82%
Japanese. I know you know
what it means.

152
00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:00.943 line:82%
I know.

153
00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:03.759 line:82%
If precious pottery breaks,

154
00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:06.697 line:82%
the Japanese put the broken pieces
together with molten gold.

155
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:10.085 line:82%
The object looks stronger
and more beautiful.

156
00:14:10.274 --> 00:14:12.717 line:82%
It's even considered more valuable.

157
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.371 line:82%
Ma'am, look at this file.

158
00:14:16.671 --> 00:14:18.874 line:82%
These are the broken pieces
of our organisation.

159
00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:20.785 line:82%
They're soldiers like me.

160
00:14:21.005 --> 00:14:24.257 line:82%
Forced to retire because of injury
or trauma.

161
00:14:24.718 --> 00:14:26.572 line:82%
But they're not done yet.

162
00:14:26.942 --> 00:14:29.820 line:82%
They're still full of guts and passion.

163
00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:33.922 line:82%
They're ready to fight
and die for India.

164
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.839 line:82%
So what do you want?
To form a new unit?

165
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.211 line:82%
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:14:39.473 --> 00:14:42.213 line:82%
Do you realise how many people will
need convincing?

167
00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:46.003 line:82%
There'll be so much red tape,
your hands will get glued together.

168
00:14:46.273 --> 00:14:47.152 line:82%
Try it.

169
00:14:47.444 --> 00:14:50.851 line:82%
You think I've just been
growing my hair out?

170
00:14:51.472 --> 00:14:53.720 line:82%
I've tried it. And better,
I've done it.

171
00:14:59.622 --> 00:15:02.713 line:82%
J.O.C.R.

172
00:15:04.078 --> 00:15:04.995 line:82%
JOCR?

173
00:15:06.109 --> 00:15:08.134 line:82%
"Joint Operations and Covert Research,"
ma'am.

174
00:15:10.483 --> 00:15:11.948 line:82%
Giving me a new job?

175
00:15:12.675 --> 00:15:14.158 line:82%
No, ma'am.

176
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.577 line:82%
Just returning my boss her chair.

177
00:15:20.758 --> 00:15:22.703 line:82%
You were looking for a new hobby.

178
00:15:23.457 --> 00:15:25.194 line:82%
Try Kintsugi, please.

179
00:15:26.487 --> 00:15:31.785 line:82%
These broken soldiers need
new meaning in their lives.

180
00:15:32.228 --> 00:15:34.144 line:82%
They're ready for a mission.

181
00:15:35.487 --> 00:15:39.000 line:82%
You are the molten gold
who can put them together.

182
00:15:39.987 --> 00:15:41.676 line:82%
Stronger than before,

183
00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:44.104 line:82%
more dangerous.

184
00:15:58.297 --> 00:16:01.066 line:82%
That was the birth of Team JOCR.

185
00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:03.776 line:82%
Every important mission for India

186
00:16:04.145 --> 00:16:08.882 line:82%
that no one else could carry out,
or take the responsibility for -

187
00:16:09.874 --> 00:16:13.302 line:82%
that was our playground.
We had no rules to stop us.

188
00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:16.037 line:82%
So obviously anyone
who loved rules

189
00:16:16.848 --> 00:16:21.252 line:82%
had a problem with us.
Like our Colonel Luthra.

190
00:16:21.638 --> 00:16:22.699 line:82%
Wow!

191
00:16:23.174 --> 00:16:24.363 line:82%
Beautiful.

192
00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:26.402 line:82%
Very beautiful.

193
00:16:27.401 --> 00:16:32.095 line:82%
This space was reserved for a recreational
club for us and other departments.

194
00:16:32.438 --> 00:16:35.166 line:82%
A gym, sauna, pool tables, etc.

195
00:16:35.368 --> 00:16:37.107 line:82%
Sauna? Pool tables?

196
00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:39.159 line:82%
Excuse me, sir,
you can't be serious.

197
00:16:39.515 --> 00:16:42.119 line:82%
- These people are my officers.
- They're not officers.

198
00:16:42.524 --> 00:16:45.686 line:82%
You've made JOCR
with some broken jokers.

199
00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:49.132 line:82%
They're just broken eggshells.

200
00:16:49.526 --> 00:16:51.238 line:82%
How dare you!

201
00:16:55.533 --> 00:16:56.852 line:82%
Good invention, guys.

202
00:16:57.074 --> 00:16:59.104 line:82%
- Rishi, well done!
- Thank you, sir.

203
00:17:02.129 --> 00:17:04.493 line:82%
- Did you think I actually...
- No, ma'am.

204
00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:07.005 line:82%
Oh, come on, Pathaan.
I was just playing along.

205
00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.447 line:82%
Would I talk to a superior
like that?

206
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.583 line:82%
No, never.

207
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.084 line:82%
Don't be a child.

208
00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:14.547 line:82%
I admit Rishi's invention is very real.

209
00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:17.265 line:82%
But Pathaan, you can't mess with me.

210
00:17:17.856 --> 00:17:20.115 line:82%
- Is this a bad time?
- No, sir.

211
00:17:20.913 --> 00:17:21.969 line:82%
Oh!

212
00:17:23.411 --> 00:17:25.340 line:82%
He looks a little pale.

213
00:17:26.399 --> 00:17:29.741 line:82%
And he has those bags under his eyes,
which you guys missed.

214
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.179 line:82%
Have you seen
Luthra's double chin?

215
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.215 line:82%
It hangs down to his belly.

216
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.045 line:82%
And Luthra's paunch?

217
00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:40.871 line:82%
Sir!

218
00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:42.277 line:82%
Very good.

219
00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:44.461 line:82%
Very serious department.

220
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:47.290 line:82%
Now I can make my recommendations
to the Defence Secretary.

221
00:17:48.154 --> 00:17:53.324 line:82%
I told you you're broken eggshells.
That's all.

222
00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.381 line:82%
Paunch, ma'am!

223
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.056 line:82%
Sir. Sir.

224
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:59.970 line:82%
Sir, now that you're here,
wait two minutes, please.

225
00:18:00.264 --> 00:18:01.808 line:82%
I must show you something.

226
00:18:02.796 --> 00:18:05.861 line:82%
Aeroflot 394C - 144 casualties.

227
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.295 line:82%
Daesh claimed it was their doing.

228
00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:10.133 line:82%
Norwegian ship, Asgard.

229
00:18:10.352 --> 00:18:12.181 line:82%
Pirates destroyed it
in the Gulf of Aden.

230
00:18:12.359 --> 00:18:14.550 line:82%
Biggest ecological disaster
of the decade.

231
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:16.161 line:82%
Courtesy Boko Haram.

232
00:18:16.517 --> 00:18:17.792 line:82%
Chemical attack on the Japanese...

233
00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:20.994 line:82%
The Japanese outfit Aleph
claimed responsibility.

234
00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:24.963 line:82%
You think I have no intel
on all this?

235
00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:27.094 line:82%
No, sir. It wasn't Aleph

236
00:18:27.947 --> 00:18:29.426 line:82%
or Boko Haram or Daesh.

237
00:18:29.892 --> 00:18:31.903 line:82%
At least, they weren't
directly involved.

238
00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:36.164 line:82%
They outsourced these attacks
to a private terrorist group.

239
00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:39.366 line:82%
They work on contract,
not for ideological reasons.

240
00:18:39.632 --> 00:18:40.878 line:82%
Really?

241
00:18:41.507 --> 00:18:43.573 line:82%
Terrorists are corporations now?

242
00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:47.345 line:82%
Let's say a group like this exists,
so what?

243
00:18:47.609 --> 00:18:49.743 line:82%
They're Interpol's problem,
not India's.

244
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.724 line:82%
Actually sir, now it is.

245
00:18:54.194 --> 00:18:56.992 line:82%
Because their next episode
is an India special.

246
00:18:57.731 --> 00:18:59.861 line:82%
And this is a big one.

247
00:19:01.344 --> 00:19:02.344 line:82%
In Dubai.

248
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.793 line:82%
Sir, through the darknet
we found out that

249
00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:08.048 line:82%
Outfit X is planning something big
in Dubai.

250
00:19:08.629 --> 00:19:10.578 line:82%
At the Asian Scientific Conference,

251
00:19:10.783 --> 00:19:13.655 line:82%
two Indian scientists will represent
India and our...

252
00:19:13.829 --> 00:19:17.087 line:82%
At the conference our President

253
00:19:18.314 --> 00:19:19.720 line:82%
is giving the keynote address.

254
00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:24.569 line:82%
They're after the President.

255
00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:27.131 line:82%
We think so, sir.

256
00:19:27.507 --> 00:19:30.006 line:82%
I'll make sure the security
is tripled.

257
00:19:30.998 --> 00:19:32.679 line:82%
They won't get near the President.

258
00:19:33.276 --> 00:19:35.145 line:82%
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

259
00:19:35.347 --> 00:19:36.739 line:82%
Another request, sir.

260
00:19:36.978 --> 00:19:39.022 line:82%
If you don't mind,

261
00:19:39.488 --> 00:19:40.818 line:82%
these...

262
00:19:41.979 --> 00:19:43.616 line:82%
...eggshells will come with me
to Dubai.

263
00:19:44.173 --> 00:19:45.413 line:82%
Trust me, Luthra.

264
00:19:45.641 --> 00:19:47.623 line:82%
You look after the President's security,

265
00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.875 line:82%
we'll handle Outfit X.

266
00:19:52.042 --> 00:19:56.722 line:82%
DUBAI - UAE

267
00:19:57.243 --> 00:20:01.541 line:82%
We took no chances. Frankly speaking,
your Intel is paranoia.

268
00:20:02.053 --> 00:20:04.554 line:82%
I changed the President's travel
itinerary at the last minute.

269
00:20:05.026 --> 00:20:06.465 line:82%
No sign of explosives.

270
00:20:06.715 --> 00:20:09.732 line:82%
There are no spots
for a sniper to hide.

271
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.970 line:82%
Absolutely nothing suspicious.

272
00:20:12.303 --> 00:20:13.817 line:82%
Intel was real, sir.

273
00:20:14.186 --> 00:20:15.744 line:82%
But now there's radio silence.

274
00:20:15.907 --> 00:20:18.624 line:82%
They've become more careful or...

275
00:20:21.046 --> 00:20:23.573 line:82%
Sir, you said you changed
the President's travel route.

276
00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:24.546 line:82%
What was it before?

277
00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:28.283 line:82%
He was to travel with
the two scientists and the press.

278
00:20:28.479 --> 00:20:29.745 line:82%
Showing support for science.

279
00:20:29.913 --> 00:20:32.817 line:82%
Now he's taking another route.
With full security.

280
00:20:33.013 --> 00:20:35.751 line:82%
What about our scientists?
Will they travel with the President?

281
00:20:35.948 --> 00:20:38.512 line:82%
No. Multiple vehicles make
security tricky.

282
00:20:38.758 --> 00:20:41.537 line:82%
I want our NSG commandos
to focus on the President.

283
00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:45.215 line:82%
So the two scientists
who had NSG cover,

284
00:20:45.488 --> 00:20:47.494 line:82%
no longer have it.

285
00:20:48.034 --> 00:20:49.164 line:82%
Damn it!

286
00:20:49.429 --> 00:20:52.396 line:82%
They tricked us into changing
the travel itinerary.

287
00:20:53.008 --> 00:20:54.815 line:82%
Their target is not the President, sir.

288
00:20:59.235 --> 00:21:02.275 line:82%
I was hoping to take a selfie
with the President,

289
00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:04.660 line:82%
and impress the missus!

290
00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:07.426 line:82%
You still want to impress her,
after thirty years?

291
00:21:08.253 --> 00:21:11.669 line:82%
Science is easy, Farooqui.
Love is hard.

292
00:21:26.338 --> 00:21:27.347 line:82%
PATRIOTIC

293
00:21:59.834 --> 00:22:01.395 line:82%
Sir, we've been attacked.

294
00:22:05.229 --> 00:22:06.549 line:82%
You were right, Pathaan.

295
00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:08.932 line:82%
They've attacked the scientists'
convoy.

296
00:22:09.181 --> 00:22:11.341 line:82%
Lock me to the scientists' phone.

297
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.399 line:82%
- On it, sir.
- Now!

298
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.856 line:82%
Wait. Don't shoot!

299
00:22:19.049 --> 00:22:20.100 line:82%
Wait!

300
00:22:22.692 --> 00:22:24.299 line:82%
Dr. Sahani, Dr. Farooqui.

301
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:27.326 line:82%
Take my advice.
Be more scared than you are.

302
00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:29.037 line:82%
You're pretty screwed.

303
00:22:30.229 --> 00:22:32.567 line:82%
He's got the scientists
in a grey Hummer, Pathaan.

304
00:22:38.001 --> 00:22:39.749 line:82%
Sir, I've sent you
the Hummer's location.

305
00:22:56.131 --> 00:22:57.328 line:82%
There's the Hummer, sir.

306
00:24:21.024 --> 00:24:25.407 line:82%
Pathaan, I've been waiting
for a long time to meet you.

307
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:28.071 line:82%
I heard a lot about you
when I was in RAW.

308
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:30.142 line:82%
They call me "Jim".

309
00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:33.464 line:82%
Jim?

310
00:24:33.848 --> 00:24:36.245 line:82%
You probably heard I was dead.

311
00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:37.806 line:82%
So?

312
00:24:40.496 --> 00:24:43.597 line:82%
Well, I am actually dead for India.

313
00:24:44.938 --> 00:24:46.502 line:82%
Here's the proof.

314
00:24:47.854 --> 00:24:49.478 line:82%
Bravery award.

315
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.768 line:82%
I died a bloody hero.

316
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.722 line:82%
How come, Jim?

317
00:24:59.009 --> 00:25:01.164 line:82%
- I heard you...
- ...were the best?

318
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:03.916 line:82%
You heard right. I still am.

319
00:25:05.177 --> 00:25:07.169 line:82%
She broke my heart.

320
00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.601 line:82%
She'll break yours too.

321
00:25:10.426 --> 00:25:11.708 line:82%
You know her.

322
00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:16.251 line:82%
The difference is I considered
myself her lover,

323
00:25:16.612 --> 00:25:18.995 line:82%
and you think you're her son.

324
00:25:21.685 --> 00:25:23.013 line:82%
Mother India!

325
00:25:25.718 --> 00:25:27.218 line:82%
You're lucky.

326
00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:30.617 line:82%
You'll die believing your patriotism
meant something.

327
00:25:31.834 --> 00:25:34.282 line:82%
I'm sure they'll throw a medal
for bravery on your grave.

328
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.808 line:82%
They'll call you a martyr.

329
00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:39.135 line:82%
But cost to the country?

330
00:25:40.277 --> 00:25:41.182 line:82%
Zero.

331
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:46.787 line:82%
If life was different,
perhaps we'd be friends.

332
00:25:48.272 --> 00:25:49.706 line:82%
What a pity!

333
00:25:50.676 --> 00:25:53.855 line:82%
We have to play the cards
we're dealt.

334
00:25:54.716 --> 00:25:57.613 line:82%
And in this round,
I hold all the aces.

335
00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:05.947 line:82%
Raza! Rishi!

336
00:26:07.156 --> 00:26:08.032 line:82%
Guys!

337
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.571 line:82%
Rishi.

338
00:26:14.423 --> 00:26:15.728 line:82%
- My seat belt.
- I was stuck.

339
00:26:15.935 --> 00:26:17.857 line:82%
Pathaan, my seat belt.

340
00:26:20.619 --> 00:26:21.337 line:82%
Rishi!

341
00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:27.452 line:82%
Out!

342
00:26:33.984 --> 00:26:36.083 line:82%
- My legs are stuck.
- Come on.

343
00:26:38.461 --> 00:26:39.743 line:82%
My leg is stuck, sir.

344
00:26:40.018 --> 00:26:40.824 line:82%
Rishi.

345
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:42.811 line:82%
- My leg is stuck.
- Rishi.

346
00:26:43.331 --> 00:26:44.212 line:82%
Pathaan!

347
00:26:44.612 --> 00:26:45.729 line:82%
Sir, my leg is stuck.

348
00:26:46.073 --> 00:26:47.467 line:82%
- We must go, Pathaan!
- Wait!

349
00:26:47.647 --> 00:26:49.303 line:82%
- Raza!
- The car is about to explode!

350
00:26:49.562 --> 00:26:51.572 line:82%
- Take him away!
- There's nothing you can do.

351
00:26:51.857 --> 00:26:53.411 line:82%
- Pathaan, we must go.
- Go, sir.

352
00:26:53.564 --> 00:26:54.513 line:82%
Nothing we can do.

353
00:26:54.672 --> 00:26:56.011 line:82%
Sir, it's been an honour.

354
00:26:56.278 --> 00:26:57.355 line:82%
We must go, Pathaan!

355
00:26:59.081 --> 00:26:59.830 line:82%
Pathaan!

356
00:27:00.058 --> 00:27:00.869 line:82%
Jai Hind!

357
00:28:49.866 --> 00:28:50.619 line:82%
Block the road.

358
00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:24.913 line:82%
These choppers won't fly
through the tunnel,

359
00:30:25.228 --> 00:30:26.923 line:82%
they'll crash into the building.

360
00:30:28.603 --> 00:30:30.472 line:82%
Well, Pathaan? What next?

361
00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:32.490 line:82%
Their lives hang by this rope.

362
00:30:32.726 --> 00:30:34.474 line:82%
Only you can untie the knot.

363
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.235 line:82%
So, what's it gonna be, buddy?

364
00:30:37.642 --> 00:30:40.039 line:82%
Sacrifice? Or common sense?

365
00:30:48.162 --> 00:30:49.607 line:82%
Say hello to Mother India!

366
00:30:49.976 --> 00:30:51.947 line:82%
Tell her I'm coming soon.

367
00:30:52.754 --> 00:30:54.255 line:82%
I've a score to settle.

368
00:31:16.963 --> 00:31:18.094 line:82%
Jim.

369
00:31:19.109 --> 00:31:22.011 line:82%
Can't trust dead men
to stay dead.

370
00:31:23.086 --> 00:31:25.079 line:82%
Was Jim working for RAW?

371
00:31:25.741 --> 00:31:27.810 line:82%
Jim and Kabir.

372
00:31:28.749 --> 00:31:30.826 line:82%
Our best agents.

373
00:31:31.748 --> 00:31:33.842 line:82%
They were quite similar.

374
00:31:34.827 --> 00:31:38.052 line:82%
Calculative, precise, methodical.

375
00:31:39.517 --> 00:31:40.986 line:82%
Not like our Mr. Pathaan.

376
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.628 line:82%
He first listens to his heart,
then to his superiors.

377
00:31:46.677 --> 00:31:49.279 line:82%
- So, what went wrong?
- A job.

378
00:31:49.762 --> 00:31:53.785 line:82%
Remember the ONGC drilling team
the Somalian pirates kidnapped?

379
00:31:54.993 --> 00:31:56.758 line:82%
Jim went in solo.

380
00:31:57.294 --> 00:32:01.903 line:82%
He managed to save six hostages,
totally unharmed.

381
00:32:03.608 --> 00:32:05.871 line:82%
The pirates swore to take revenge.

382
00:32:06.252 --> 00:32:08.609 line:82%
They finally tracked Jim down.

383
00:32:10.014 --> 00:32:13.232 line:82%
They asked for a ransom of 100 million
in exchange for Jim and his wife.

384
00:32:13.645 --> 00:32:17.075 line:82%
But we don't negotiate
with terrorists.

385
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.541 line:82%
You love your country too much.

386
00:32:24.901 --> 00:32:26.488 line:82%
But your country,

387
00:32:27.565 --> 00:32:28.916 line:82%
no love you.

388
00:32:38.476 --> 00:32:39.208 line:82%
No!

389
00:32:40.122 --> 00:32:41.593 line:82%
No!

390
00:32:43.453 --> 00:32:44.541 line:82%
No! No!

391
00:32:45.078 --> 00:32:46.290 line:82%
No!

392
00:32:46.933 --> 00:32:47.513 line:82%
No.

393
00:32:50.984 --> 00:32:51.957 line:82%
No!

394
00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.146 line:82%
No. Please leave her.

395
00:32:58.621 --> 00:32:59.557 line:82%
No!

396
00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:00.843 line:82%
No!

397
00:33:05.638 --> 00:33:07.067 line:82%
No!

398
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.841 line:82%
No!

399
00:33:12.706 --> 00:33:14.208 line:82%
No!

400
00:33:15.052 --> 00:33:16.366 line:82%
No!

401
00:33:19.895 --> 00:33:23.567 line:82%
We never found Jim's body.
So we assumed he was dead.

402
00:33:24.069 --> 00:33:26.271 line:82%
Jim was given a medal,
the bravery award.

403
00:33:26.551 --> 00:33:28.592 line:82%
One of his uncles received it.

404
00:33:28.989 --> 00:33:34.206 line:82%
Couldn't you have paid the ransom for
an agent like him and his family?

405
00:33:36.319 --> 00:33:38.924 line:82%
Your department does not
lack funds, sir.

406
00:33:39.278 --> 00:33:41.392 line:82%
Our funds can't be wasted
on personal matters.

407
00:33:42.813 --> 00:33:44.773 line:82%
Such honesty, sir!

408
00:33:45.555 --> 00:33:47.627 line:82%
What if it was a minister's family?

409
00:33:47.911 --> 00:33:50.789 line:82%
Only the weak go down
on their knees, Pathaan.

410
00:33:51.923 --> 00:33:52.970 line:82%
Not soldiers.

411
00:33:53.215 --> 00:33:56.474 line:82%
Now this soldier will have us
on our knees.

412
00:33:57.013 --> 00:33:58.207 line:82%
Colonel,

413
00:33:59.887 --> 00:34:02.051 line:82%
I have looked into his eyes.

414
00:34:03.942 --> 00:34:06.837 line:82%
He's beyond right and wrong,
good and bad.

415
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.747 line:82%
Your decision has convinced him
that his actions are justified.

416
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:15.506 line:82%
And now

417
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:19.035 line:82%
he will not stop.

418
00:34:32.041 --> 00:34:34.079 line:82%
Shweta, check for leads on the darknet.

419
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.702 line:82%
- Raktbeej.
- What's that?

420
00:34:36.857 --> 00:34:38.728 line:82%
The word keeps popping up.

421
00:34:38.946 --> 00:34:42.404 line:82%
- Raktbeej. Sounds like a codeword.
- For a man? Or an object?

422
00:34:43.827 --> 00:34:45.164 line:82%
Have the dead in Dubai
been identified?

423
00:34:45.344 --> 00:34:47.717 line:82%
Yes sir.
All ex-soldiers or secret agents.

424
00:34:48.027 --> 00:34:50.634 line:82%
They recently received money transfers.

425
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:51.716 line:82%
From one account?

426
00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:55.486 line:82%
Yes. From a Pakistani doctor.
Rubina Mohsin.

427
00:34:57.775 --> 00:34:58.946 line:82%
She lives in London.

428
00:34:59.127 --> 00:35:02.819 line:82%
Her account was inactive for months.
Then these transfers were made.

429
00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:04.831 line:82%
Who knows if she was even aware.

430
00:35:05.016 --> 00:35:07.966 line:82%
The bank would've alerted her
about the transfers.

431
00:35:08.274 --> 00:35:10.532 line:82%
We've hacked her emails.
She hasn't logged in for a month.

432
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:11.912 line:82%
Her phone is off too.

433
00:35:12.092 --> 00:35:14.640 line:82%
But two hours ago,
she checked in online.

434
00:35:14.885 --> 00:35:16.401 line:82%
She's taking a flight.

435
00:35:16.852 --> 00:35:17.972 line:82%
Where to?

436
00:35:18.579 --> 00:35:21.244 line:82%
If it was another agent,
she'd be off to Iraq or Syria.

437
00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:22.645 line:82%
As it's you -

438
00:35:23.807 --> 00:35:25.200 line:82%
it's Spain.

439
00:35:26.402 --> 00:35:29.476 line:82%
I'm desperate for a vacation.

440
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.831 line:82%
Tonight...

441
00:35:32.281 --> 00:35:36.756 line:82%
life is complete

442
00:35:37.923 --> 00:35:39.922 line:82%
In this instant...

443
00:35:40.312 --> 00:35:44.934 line:82%
life is rich

444
00:35:50.354 --> 00:35:52.518 line:82%
Tonight...

445
00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:57.646 line:82%
life is complete

446
00:35:58.757 --> 00:36:00.740 line:82%
In this instant...

447
00:36:01.084 --> 00:36:05.828 line:82%
life is rich

448
00:36:07.008 --> 00:36:10.882 line:82%
My heart has been robbed

449
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.293 line:82%
by my lovers

450
00:36:15.187 --> 00:36:19.189 line:82%
How they torment me

451
00:36:19.731 --> 00:36:22.271 line:82%
These crazy thoughts of mine

452
00:36:23.453 --> 00:36:27.156 line:82%
The moment I feel a wave
of modesty

453
00:36:27.725 --> 00:36:30.647 line:82%
I throw it to the wind

454
00:36:31.742 --> 00:36:38.931 line:82%
The world has not seen
my true colours

455
00:36:40.126 --> 00:36:43.986 line:82%
My heart has been robbed

456
00:36:44.531 --> 00:36:47.434 line:82%
by my lovers

457
00:36:48.353 --> 00:36:52.420 line:82%
How they torment me

458
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:55.722 line:82%
These crazy thoughts of mine

459
00:36:56.564 --> 00:37:00.494 line:82%
The moment I feel a wave
of modesty

460
00:37:00.832 --> 00:37:03.853 line:82%
I throw it to the wind

461
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:11.964 line:82%
The world has not seen
my true colours

462
00:37:46.176 --> 00:37:49.001 line:82%
Shweta, I'm sending you info
on Dr. Rubina Mohsin. Check it.

463
00:37:49.355 --> 00:37:51.811 line:82%
I'm like a breath of fresh air

464
00:37:52.999 --> 00:37:56.038 line:82%
My style, my habits,
all new

465
00:37:57.626 --> 00:38:00.063 line:82%
I'm like a breath of fresh air

466
00:38:01.329 --> 00:38:04.137 line:82%
My style, my habits,
all new

467
00:38:05.963 --> 00:38:09.389 line:82%
I never follow the right path

468
00:38:09.863 --> 00:38:14.443 line:82%
The path of wrong
is so inviting

469
00:38:15.274 --> 00:38:17.281 line:82%
Tonight...

470
00:38:17.873 --> 00:38:22.284 line:82%
life is complete

471
00:38:23.549 --> 00:38:25.487 line:82%
In this instant...

472
00:38:25.858 --> 00:38:30.537 line:82%
life is rich

473
00:38:31.726 --> 00:38:35.488 line:82%
When I feel a wave of modesty

474
00:38:35.953 --> 00:38:38.981 line:82%
I throw it to the wind

475
00:38:39.987 --> 00:38:46.968 line:82%
The world has not seen
my true colours

476
00:38:48.377 --> 00:38:52.294 line:82%
My heart has been robbed

477
00:38:52.775 --> 00:38:55.472 line:82%
by my lovers

478
00:38:56.585 --> 00:39:00.702 line:82%

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.595 line:82%
life is complete

482
00:39:30.131 --> 00:39:32.747 line:82%
by my lovers

483
00:39:34.278 --> 00:39:36.822 line:82%
life is complete

484
00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.376 line:82%
My heart has been robbed

485
00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:45.142 line:82%
by my lovers

486
00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:48.326 line:82%
Tonight...

487
00:39:50.932 --> 00:39:52.458 line:82%
life is complete

488
00:39:54.922 --> 00:39:57.463 line:82%
by my lovers

489
00:39:58.971 --> 00:40:01.028 line:82%
life is complete

490
00:41:18.618 --> 00:41:19.902 line:82%
Cool, no?

491
00:41:20.663 --> 00:41:23.892 line:82%
Throw a few seeds on the ground
and the ants come crawling.

492
00:41:24.435 --> 00:41:26.829 line:82%
A bank account, a SIM card...

493
00:41:27.528 --> 00:41:30.103 line:82%
and Pathaan appears
in flesh and blood.

494
00:41:31.142 --> 00:41:32.572 line:82%
The hunter...

495
00:41:34.838 --> 00:41:35.784 line:82%
hunted!

496
00:41:40.636 --> 00:41:42.261 line:82%
Meet my team, Pathaan.

497
00:41:43.238 --> 00:41:45.700 line:82%
Raafe, ex-GID.

498
00:41:46.361 --> 00:41:48.512 line:82%
Sergei, ex-SBU.

499
00:41:48.963 --> 00:41:51.082 line:82%
Begio, ex-AISE.

500
00:41:51.423 --> 00:41:53.296 line:82%
Dietrich, ex-BDD.

501
00:41:55.126 --> 00:41:58.148 line:82%
And Rubai, ex-ISI.

502
00:41:58.448 --> 00:41:59.499 line:82%
Nice.

503
00:42:00.575 --> 00:42:03.633 line:82%
The world's top-secret agencies
are all represented here.

504
00:42:05.891 --> 00:42:07.865 line:82%
Only India is missing.

505
00:42:10.021 --> 00:42:11.148 line:82%
Will you oblige?

506
00:42:14.037 --> 00:42:16.367 line:82%
You offering me a job?

507
00:42:17.203 --> 00:42:18.595 line:82%
Are you for real?

508
00:42:18.865 --> 00:42:21.393 line:82%
Actually, I came here to offer you
a position

509
00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:26.550 line:82%
in a 6ft hole I've dug for you.
There's room to lie down too.

510
00:42:27.453 --> 00:42:29.909 line:82%
Will you come half naked like this?

511
00:42:30.754 --> 00:42:32.463 line:82%
Or must I drag you out?

512
00:42:34.081 --> 00:42:37.146 line:82%
I already have a grave
with my name on it, Pathaan.

513
00:42:37.528 --> 00:42:39.308 line:82%
You do too.

514
00:42:40.167 --> 00:42:42.445 line:82%
Since the day you became
a soldier.

515
00:42:43.153 --> 00:42:46.243 line:82%
That's all that Mother India offers.

516
00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.122 line:82%
A never-ending supply of coffins.

517
00:42:49.784 --> 00:42:53.006 line:82%
Only the names of the
corpses change.

518
00:42:54.968 --> 00:42:56.227 line:82%
See, Pathaan.

519
00:42:56.718 --> 00:43:00.046 line:82%
We're not answerable to anyone.
Family, foe or friend.

520
00:43:01.767 --> 00:43:05.547 line:82%
We choose the jobs we want.
And demand the price we want.

521
00:43:06.246 --> 00:43:07.592 line:82%
Join us, Pathaan.

522
00:43:07.899 --> 00:43:10.977 line:82%
Be rich. Be powerful.

523
00:43:15.394 --> 00:43:16.980 line:82%
Or be a corpse.

524
00:43:18.146 --> 00:43:19.510 line:82%
Simple.

525
00:43:20.574 --> 00:43:22.194 line:82%
Shall I cuss you in English?

526
00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:24.796 line:82%
Or explain in Hindi?

527
00:43:28.263 --> 00:43:29.595 line:82%
Pay up, guys.

528
00:43:30.196 --> 00:43:32.533 line:82%
I wagered you'd refuse my offer.

529
00:43:35.095 --> 00:43:37.167 line:82%
Even your death wins me a bet.

530
00:43:38.744 --> 00:43:40.015 line:82%
Sorry, Pathaan.

531
00:43:40.371 --> 00:43:44.519 line:82%
If you're not on my side, I can't
afford to let you be against me.

532
00:44:16.018 --> 00:44:17.069 line:82%
Sorry, Pathaan.

533
00:44:19.644 --> 00:44:20.795 line:82%
Nothing personal.

534
00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:22.204 line:82%
Really?

535
00:44:48.614 --> 00:44:49.577 line:82%
Women!

536
00:45:05.663 --> 00:45:06.922 line:82%
Yours, ma'am.

537
00:45:16.585 --> 00:45:17.919 line:82%
- Let's go.
- Of course.

538
00:45:24.468 --> 00:45:26.531 line:82%
Are you ex-ISI?

539
00:45:27.076 --> 00:45:28.177 line:82%
Not ex.

540
00:45:28.397 --> 00:45:31.203 line:82%
You thought you were the only ones
monitoring Outfit X.

541
00:45:33.052 --> 00:45:35.071 line:82%
I've been with them for a year,
undercover.

542
00:45:35.335 --> 00:45:37.613 line:82%
Why all this?

543
00:45:39.459 --> 00:45:42.099 line:82%
With you, we'll get what I want
faster.

544
00:45:42.939 --> 00:45:45.340 line:82%
When did we become a "we"?

545
00:45:46.196 --> 00:45:47.686 line:82%
When I saved your life.

546
00:45:48.168 --> 00:45:49.891 line:82%
You endangered it.

547
00:45:51.534 --> 00:45:53.410 line:82%
You know that, right?

548
00:45:53.852 --> 00:45:55.576 line:82%
- Run.
- Where are you?

549
00:45:56.906 --> 00:45:58.039 line:82%
Where are you going?

550
00:45:58.366 --> 00:45:59.581 line:82%
- Wait!
- Duck.

551
00:46:00.542 --> 00:46:01.258 line:82%
Good shot.

552
00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:12.576 line:82%
You aim well.

553
00:46:13.473 --> 00:46:14.762 line:82%
So do they.

554
00:46:59.317 --> 00:47:00.433 line:82%
Father!

555
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:03.552 line:82%
Father!

556
00:47:06.762 --> 00:47:08.000 line:82%
Morning.

557
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.111 line:82%
You were out for 18 hours.

558
00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:13.526 line:82%
Take it easy.

559
00:47:14.557 --> 00:47:15.623 line:82%
Fever's down.

560
00:47:15.861 --> 00:47:18.671 line:82%
No infection. And luckily the bullet
didn't touch any vital organ.

561
00:47:19.167 --> 00:47:20.917 line:82%
You were calling for your father
and crying.

562
00:47:21.268 --> 00:47:23.831 line:82%
You kept asking them to let
your father go.

563
00:47:25.103 --> 00:47:26.306 line:82%
Father...

564
00:47:27.395 --> 00:47:29.578 line:82%
He was a journalist
in the Middle East.

565
00:47:30.578 --> 00:47:32.886 line:82%
He asked too many questions.

566
00:47:33.443 --> 00:47:35.276 line:82%
Printed too many answers.

567
00:47:35.525 --> 00:47:37.121 line:82%
So he was brutally tortured

568
00:47:37.425 --> 00:47:40.398 line:82%
and we were made to watch
from the front row.

569
00:47:40.812 --> 00:47:44.555 line:82%
Then you went to Pakistan with your
mother and joined medical college.

570
00:47:44.978 --> 00:47:47.053 line:82%
Dr. Rubina Mohsin.

571
00:47:52.207 --> 00:47:54.676 line:82%
After that, to serve humanity,

572
00:47:55.833 --> 00:47:57.075 line:82%
you joined the ISI.

573
00:48:04.007 --> 00:48:05.770 line:82%
Oh. Of course.

574
00:48:10.858 --> 00:48:11.620 line:82%
Cheers.

575
00:48:22.485 --> 00:48:24.132 line:82%
Couldn't you find a cheaper drink?

576
00:48:25.223 --> 00:48:28.280 line:82%
Thing is, we don't have big budgets
like the ISI.

577
00:48:29.269 --> 00:48:30.355 line:82%
But seriously,

578
00:48:31.356 --> 00:48:32.547 line:82%
why did you save my life?

579
00:48:34.358 --> 00:48:36.522 line:82%
Aren't your good looks
and personality enough?

580
00:48:37.216 --> 00:48:39.824 line:82%
Normally they are. I'm so sexy.

581
00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:44.366 line:82%
You said we'd get what
you wanted faster with me.

582
00:48:45.542 --> 00:48:49.305 line:82%
So I want to know,
what do "we" want?

583
00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:52.143 line:82%
Raktbeej.

584
00:48:53.144 --> 00:48:54.191 line:82%
Heard the name?

585
00:48:54.959 --> 00:48:57.478 line:82%
He was a demon.

586
00:48:58.181 --> 00:49:00.090 line:82%
Wherever a drop of his blood fell,

587
00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:02.472 line:82%
another Raktbeej was born.

588
00:49:02.783 --> 00:49:05.586 line:82%
Basically, it was impossible
to destroy Raktbeej.

589
00:49:10.437 --> 00:49:12.863 line:82%
Whatever this Raktbeej is,
it's in Russia.

590
00:49:13.486 --> 00:49:14.954 line:82%
In 7 days...

591
00:49:15.711 --> 00:49:18.646 line:82%
In 7 days...what?

592
00:49:20.386 --> 00:49:23.267 line:82%
Jim will take delivery of Raktbeej
in 7 days.

593
00:49:23.826 --> 00:49:25.583 line:82%
Then all hell will break loose.

594
00:49:27.735 --> 00:49:30.848 line:82%
- So basically, we have...
- 7 days. Got it.

595
00:49:31.434 --> 00:49:32.457 line:82%
Cheers.

596
00:49:32.872 --> 00:49:34.272 line:82%
Bottoms up!

597
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:40.414 line:82%
Think you skipped school the day
they spoke about ISI and India.

598
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:44.236 line:82%
You see we don't get on so well.

599
00:49:45.884 --> 00:49:52.082 line:82%
Besides, the first day we met, you put
Jim's gun against my head. Remember?

600
00:49:52.826 --> 00:49:54.195 line:82%
So don't take it personally

601
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:56.747 line:82%
if I have a few trust issues.

602
00:49:57.588 --> 00:49:59.782 line:82%
Some things are more important
than trust issues.

603
00:49:59.986 --> 00:50:03.947 line:82%
Like these 7 days and Raktbeej.

604
00:50:05.537 --> 00:50:08.078 line:82%
So are you in?
Or are you out?

605
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:13.300 line:82%
So am I in?

606
00:50:14.396 --> 00:50:15.878 line:82%
Or am I out?

607
00:50:18.962 --> 00:50:20.666 line:82%
Russia's a big place.

608
00:50:20.899 --> 00:50:23.858 line:82%
Do you know the address?
Any landmark?

609
00:50:24.097 --> 00:50:25.834 line:82%
You know. Something.

610
00:50:26.534 --> 00:50:30.954 line:82%
Vault 412, Moscow,
Woskwich Tower.

611
00:50:31.692 --> 00:50:33.611 line:82%
You must know the address.

612
00:50:34.107 --> 00:50:36.483 line:82%
You were posted in Russia
for three years.

613
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:40.181 line:82%
What else do you know
about me?

614
00:50:40.677 --> 00:50:42.284 line:82%
Do you want me to tell you
everything now?

615
00:50:42.541 --> 00:50:43.379 line:82%
Scary.

616
00:50:43.656 --> 00:50:46.975 line:82%
An ISI agent tells us there's something
in Moscow that Jim's after.

617
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:48.157 line:82%
Yes, ma'am.

618
00:50:48.858 --> 00:50:51.243 line:82%
I've heard about Raktbeej
on the darknet.

619
00:50:51.936 --> 00:50:53.281 line:82%
Do you know what it is?

620
00:50:56.024 --> 00:50:56.941 line:82%
No.

621
00:50:57.114 --> 00:51:00.313 line:82%
So, let's hope wherever it is,
it stays unknown.

622
00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.425 line:82%
I know you're familiar with
every corner of Russia.

623
00:51:03.675 --> 00:51:07.211 line:82%
But Russia is still a friendly country
and a crucial ally.

624
00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:11.076 line:82%
A scandal will not be tolerated
in Moscow or in Delhi.

625
00:51:11.598 --> 00:51:13.744 line:82%
Ma'am, you know
Jim wants Raktbeej.

626
00:51:14.044 --> 00:51:16.070 line:82%
If he can't buy it,
he'll steal it.

627
00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:18.559 line:82%
And if you get caught?

628
00:51:19.555 --> 00:51:21.825 line:82%
Don't try negotiating for me.

629
00:51:23.218 --> 00:51:24.378 line:82%
I'm not Jim.

630
00:51:25.952 --> 00:51:27.150 line:82%
Damn it!

631
00:51:28.641 --> 00:51:30.750 line:82%
Whatever Raktbeej is,

632
00:51:31.297 --> 00:51:35.075 line:82%
neither Jim nor ISI should get
their hands on it.

633
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.610 line:82%
Go, get it!

634
00:51:37.629 --> 00:51:38.994 line:82%
Love you, ma'am.

635
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.963 line:82%
MOSCOW - RUSSIA

636
00:51:42.575 --> 00:51:43.540 line:82%
Welcome.

637
00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.418 line:82%
Sir, let me show you around.

638
00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.538 line:82%
Same to you.

639
00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.901 line:82%
- For an English dictionary.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

640
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.934 line:82%
You need anything,
contact Andrei.

641
00:51:54.576 --> 00:51:56.500 line:82%
You have a great honeymoon.

642
00:51:58.633 --> 00:52:00.722 line:82%
You didn't tell me we were
on our honeymoon.

643
00:52:00.978 --> 00:52:04.145 line:82%
If you had denied it, it would've
broken Andrei's heart.

644
00:52:10.064 --> 00:52:11.970 line:82%
Look. What a stunning view!

645
00:52:12.198 --> 00:52:13.198 line:82%
Wow!

646
00:52:13.685 --> 00:52:17.901 line:82%
I never thought I'd see such a big
building on my wedding night!

647
00:52:18.237 --> 00:52:20.743 line:82%
If you stay with me,
there's more fun to come.

648
00:52:21.051 --> 00:52:23.411 line:82%
Many corporates have their offices
in that building.

649
00:52:23.624 --> 00:52:23.960 line:82%
WOSKWICH TOWER

650
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:25.693 line:82%
This is the Woskwich Tower.

651
00:52:25.904 --> 00:52:29.285 line:82%
The 92nd floor is home to the world's
most secure vault.

652
00:52:29.477 --> 00:52:30.090 line:82%
92ND FLOOR - SECURED VAULT

653
00:52:30.743 --> 00:52:33.032 line:82%
The vault is a 30ft x 30ft room.

654
00:52:33.345 --> 00:52:36.955 line:82%
No key or explosive can open it.

655
00:52:37.312 --> 00:52:40.758 line:82%
No laser can cut through.
No acid burn through.

656
00:52:41.129 --> 00:52:44.924 line:82%
Can't cut it, can't break it.
Can't blow it up, can't burn it.

657
00:52:45.656 --> 00:52:47.026 line:82%
But we can open it!

658
00:52:47.494 --> 00:52:49.714 line:82%
But, but, but, there's only
one problem.

659
00:52:50.585 --> 00:52:54.632 line:82%
The vault has a lock and key
but two different people have them.

660
00:52:54.874 --> 00:52:56.141 line:82%
So when you need to open it,

661
00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:58.791 line:82%
an uncle brings the lock
from his home

662
00:52:59.185 --> 00:53:00.772 line:82%
and an aunty brings the key.

663
00:53:01.205 --> 00:53:05.911 line:82%
The lock and key meet like the union
of the Ganges and Jamuna.

664
00:53:12.573 --> 00:53:15.037 line:82%
So, must we steal both lock
and key?

665
00:53:15.233 --> 00:53:16.586 line:82%
Yes, exactly.

666
00:53:16.867 --> 00:53:18.768 line:82%
But there's a complication.

667
00:53:19.034 --> 00:53:23.309 line:82%
The lock is 12kms away
in Uncle Grigor's office.

668
00:53:23.457 --> 00:53:23.858 line:82%
GRIGOR UNCLE - 12 KMS

669
00:53:24.062 --> 00:53:28.053 line:82%
And the key is 16kms away
with Aunty Karen.

670
00:53:28.193 --> 00:53:28.726 line:82%
KAREN AUNTY - 16 KMS

671
00:53:28.926 --> 00:53:32.404 line:82%
And of course, their offices
are in opposite directions.

672
00:53:32.685 --> 00:53:33.673 line:82%
And the best part?

673
00:53:33.916 --> 00:53:36.791 line:82%
We must get to the vault in 10 minutes
once we've stolen them.

674
00:53:36.977 --> 00:53:37.480 line:82%
10 MIN

675
00:53:37.762 --> 00:53:39.131 line:82%
- Say 'what'?
- What?

676
00:53:39.532 --> 00:53:41.417 line:82%
I love this sugar-free yoghurt.

677
00:53:41.787 --> 00:53:44.144 line:82%
As soon as the lock and key
are removed,

678
00:53:44.428 --> 00:53:46.140 line:82%
a timer starts ticking.

679
00:53:47.036 --> 00:53:50.820 line:82%
Within 10 minutes, at FSB headquarters,
someone must enter an "all-clear code".

680
00:53:51.105 --> 00:53:54.554 line:82%
This confirms all's well
and it's not Rubai and Pathaan.

681
00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.941 line:82%
- Or else...
- Or else?

682
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:03.774 line:82%
Total lockdown. That's it.

683
00:54:04.055 --> 00:54:07.316 line:82%
Lock, key or prayers,
nothing makes a difference.

684
00:54:07.785 --> 00:54:11.242 line:82%
Unless the system is reset
in three places.

685
00:54:13.266 --> 00:54:14.266 line:82%
Game over.

686
00:54:14.461 --> 00:54:17.794 line:82%
How can we reach the vault
in 10 minutes in Moscow traffic?

687
00:54:18.179 --> 00:54:22.286 line:82%
Step 1. To get to the main lock,
we must first open another lock.

688
00:54:22.568 --> 00:54:26.483 line:82%
To open that, we need Uncle
Grigor's fingerprints.

689
00:55:40.182 --> 00:55:42.726 line:82%
- Any cops in sight?
- Why?

690
00:55:43.704 --> 00:55:46.523 line:82%
Because you're looking
like a bomb!

691
00:55:59.627 --> 00:56:01.950 line:82%
- Have a blast.
- Oh, I will.

692
00:56:11.275 --> 00:56:12.275 line:82%
Boom!

693
00:56:14.154 --> 00:56:15.063 line:82%
Step 2.

694
00:56:15.244 --> 00:56:17.240 line:82%
Our key-holding Aunty Karen.

695
00:56:17.534 --> 00:56:20.050 line:82%
- You'll seduce her?
- I wish.

696
00:56:20.432 --> 00:56:22.271 line:82%
I'm not her type.

697
00:56:22.669 --> 00:56:26.528 line:82%
She'll be knocked out by
some sleeping pills.

698
00:56:38.874 --> 00:56:42.042 line:82%
You are my Karen!

699
00:56:42.982 --> 00:56:46.201 line:82%
You are my Karen!

700
00:56:51.682 --> 00:56:54.105 line:82%
Good night, K-K-K-Karen.

701
00:56:58.455 --> 00:57:02.191 line:82%
Step 3. We need two planes.
And two pilots.

702
00:57:02.582 --> 00:57:04.147 line:82%
Absolute professionals.

703
00:57:06.237 --> 00:57:07.541 line:82%
You picked this place?

704
00:57:07.762 --> 00:57:09.829 line:82%
No. Our pilots did.

705
00:57:10.535 --> 00:57:12.542 line:82%
Pilots? Right.

706
00:57:14.087 --> 00:57:16.097 line:82%
They're late. Very professional.

707
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:21.018 line:82%
Actually, flying is just their hobby.

708
00:57:21.435 --> 00:57:23.734 line:82%
Professionally, they're singers.

709
00:57:26.319 --> 00:57:28.930 line:82%
- Singers?
- Singers.

710
00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:43.367 line:82%
What about the bill?

711
00:57:43.673 --> 00:57:45.725 line:82%
Rubai, listen. You'll have
some cheese?

712
00:57:48.686 --> 00:57:51.640 line:82%
- Now for step 4.
- What step is this?

713
00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:54.013 line:82%
Never mind. It's fun.

714
00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.664 line:82%
Are you and the missus looking
for anything in particular?

715
00:57:59.905 --> 00:58:00.978 line:82%
Very particular.

716
00:58:03.051 --> 00:58:05.592 line:82%
How would you like to earn
20,000 boobles?

717
00:58:06.732 --> 00:58:08.214 line:82%
Rubles!

718
00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.956 line:82%
What did I say?

719
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:13.173 line:82%
I meant rubles.

720
00:58:23.641 --> 00:58:25.695 line:82%
Let's sleep early.
Tomorrow's a big day.

721
00:58:26.113 --> 00:58:29.159 line:82%
We have a meeting with
Raktbeej. Our final step.

722
00:58:46.111 --> 00:58:50.689 line:82%
I think you're taking this
honeymoon suite too seriously.

723
00:58:51.248 --> 00:58:53.974 line:82%
Tomorrow we have an appointment
with Raktbeej, so...

724
00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:55.865 line:82%
Get some rest.

725
00:58:56.878 --> 00:58:59.504 line:82%
This may be our last night
outside a Russian jail.

726
00:59:02.203 --> 00:59:03.991 line:82%
Then we shouldn't waste it.

727
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:06.911 line:82%
Yeah! Waste is not good.

728
00:59:07.485 --> 00:59:08.934 line:82%
Maybe I...

729
00:59:09.137 --> 00:59:10.716 line:82%
Could you help with my bandages?

730
00:59:11.227 --> 00:59:13.054 line:82%
Bandages? Of course.

731
00:59:13.554 --> 00:59:16.131 line:82%
Nothing better I'd like to do
than change your bandages.

732
00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.699 line:82%
Pathaan.

733
00:59:22.148 --> 00:59:24.176 line:82%
I mean, you're actually a Pathaan?

734
00:59:25.152 --> 00:59:26.806 line:82%
Are you a Muslim?

735
00:59:28.767 --> 00:59:31.812 line:82%
Rubai, I don't know what I am.
Who I am.

736
00:59:32.616 --> 00:59:34.609 line:82%
Or who my parents were.

737
00:59:36.744 --> 00:59:39.519 line:82%
Or why I was abandoned
in front of a cinema.

738
00:59:42.718 --> 00:59:45.599 line:82%
Landed up in an orphanage,
then a juvenile centre,

739
00:59:46.339 --> 00:59:48.074 line:82%
then a remand home.

740
00:59:52.665 --> 00:59:57.028 line:82%
So, it was really my country
that raised me.

741
00:59:58.673 --> 01:00:00.729 line:82%
When I was older,

742
01:00:01.111 --> 01:00:03.204 line:82%
I wanted to be a good son

743
01:00:03.494 --> 01:00:06.086 line:82%
and serve my parents.
Pay them back.

744
01:00:07.955 --> 01:00:10.279 line:82%
So I joined the Indian army.

745
01:00:14.841 --> 01:00:17.138 line:82%
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

746
01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.545 line:82%
By the way,

747
01:00:21.682 --> 01:00:24.777 line:82%
what film was playing at the
cinema where they left you?

748
01:00:30.269 --> 01:00:31.930 line:82%
You don't take emotions seriously?

749
01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:35.110 line:82%
Do you?

750
01:00:39.244 --> 01:00:40.080 line:82%
Never.

751
01:00:42.107 --> 01:00:46.168 line:82%
So how did you turn from Lawaaris
to Khuda Gawah?

752
01:00:47.322 --> 01:00:48.371 line:82%
It was in 2002.

753
01:00:48.663 --> 01:00:51.956 line:82%
I was in Afghanistan on a joint
mission with the US army.

754
01:00:53.554 --> 01:00:54.742 line:82%
My first mission.

755
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:55.776 line:82%
U.S.A. MILITARY BASE, AFGHANISTAN

756
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.672 line:82%
The US target that day
was a Salauddin Husseini,

757
01:00:57.868 --> 01:00:58.938 line:82%
a Taliban leader.

758
01:00:59.095 --> 01:00:59.354 line:82%
INACTIVE

759
01:00:59.521 --> 01:01:02.456 line:82%
A missile was locked
on to the location of his phone.

760
01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:10.826 line:82%
This Mr. Husseini was a teacher
in a madrasa.

761
01:01:11.765 --> 01:01:13.417 line:82%
People started to run.

762
01:01:13.887 --> 01:01:17.459 line:82%
The problem was there were
30 kids still in the madrasa,

763
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:20.065 line:82%
and the missile was to strike
in one minute.

764
01:01:20.941 --> 01:01:23.223 line:82%
The missile was locked
on to the location of his phone.

765
01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:26.487 line:82%
The kids were still inside.

766
01:01:46.734 --> 01:01:48.943 line:82%
I was in a coma for a month.

767
01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:56.324 line:82%
A day did not go by without someone
in that village praying for me.

768
01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.415 line:82%
Subhanallah.

769
01:02:04.777 --> 01:02:05.831 line:82%
How are you?

770
01:02:08.295 --> 01:02:09.725 line:82%
- Adaab.
- Salaam.

771
01:02:10.859 --> 01:02:14.652 line:82%
Everyone has been praying
for your good health.

772
01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:18.147 line:82%
I swear, no Pathaan mother

773
01:02:18.406 --> 01:02:21.747 line:82%
has ever given birth to someone
as brave as you.

774
01:02:22.276 --> 01:02:25.073 line:82%
From today, we are yours
and you are ours.

775
01:02:25.919 --> 01:02:27.436 line:82%
Our Pathaan.

776
01:02:35.102 --> 01:02:36.381 line:82%
You know what?

777
01:02:36.856 --> 01:02:39.975 line:82%
Every year, without fail,
I try

778
01:02:40.489 --> 01:02:44.245 line:82%
and celebrate Eid with everyone
in that village.

779
01:02:46.871 --> 01:02:49.711 line:82%
With my Pathaan family.

780
01:04:17.234 --> 01:04:19.687 line:82%
Once we have the bag,
we have 10 minutes. Don't forget.

781
01:04:31.677 --> 01:04:33.445 line:82%
- Set.
- Rubai, start your timer alarm.

782
01:04:33.735 --> 01:04:35.488 line:82%
3, 2, 1.

783
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:37.269 line:82%
Go!

784
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.659 line:82%
Karen, do you have a copy...

785
01:04:40.567 --> 01:04:41.496 line:82%
Who are you?

786
01:05:47.345 --> 01:05:48.150 line:82%
MALFUNCTION

787
01:05:48.924 --> 01:05:50.026 line:82%
Rubai!

788
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.126 line:82%
I have a release malfunction.

789
01:05:56.008 --> 01:05:58.389 line:82%
Rubai, when you're above the building,
cut your rope.

790
01:06:06.141 --> 01:06:07.606 line:82%
Captain, listen to me.

791
01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:10.372 line:82%
Are you crazy?

792
01:06:10.762 --> 01:06:11.955 line:82%
Just do it.

793
01:06:18.681 --> 01:06:19.521 line:82%
What the...?

794
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:45.612 line:82%
We're 90 seconds late. In a minute
the alarm will go off. Let's go!

795
01:07:47.719 --> 01:07:49.273 line:82%
- Vault number?
- 412.

796
01:08:05.862 --> 01:08:07.234 line:82%
How do these steps open?

797
01:08:07.545 --> 01:08:08.401 line:82%
No time for that.

798
01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:21.409 line:82%
Here.

799
01:08:24.275 --> 01:08:25.348 line:82%
Throw it to me.

800
01:08:33.955 --> 01:08:34.868 line:82%
Pathaan,

801
01:08:35.763 --> 01:08:36.762 line:82%
I'm sorry.

802
01:08:54.686 --> 01:08:56.319 line:82%
It's impossible to open that vault.

803
01:08:56.868 --> 01:08:59.515 line:82%
It is possible. For Pathaan.

804
01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:02.549 line:82%
Pathaan? Why would he help you?

805
01:09:05.628 --> 01:09:06.434 line:82%
Mate-check.

806
01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:08.361 line:82%
You mean "checkmate"?

807
01:09:08.926 --> 01:09:12.031 line:82%
When the king thinks the queen
will sacrifice herself for him,

808
01:09:12.369 --> 01:09:15.983 line:82%
all his concentration
is on saving the queen.

809
01:09:20.213 --> 01:09:23.582 line:82%
When the king realises the queen
has switched sides, it'll be...

810
01:09:24.553 --> 01:09:25.812 line:82%
too late.

811
01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.301 line:82%
Checkmate.

812
01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:33.192 line:82%
The king is dead.

813
01:10:01.903 --> 01:10:04.380 line:82%
PRESENT DAY

814
01:10:05.778 --> 01:10:07.222 line:82%
Please get ready for landing.

815
01:10:09.299 --> 01:10:12.217 line:82%
So, did the Russians
arrest Pathaan?

816
01:10:13.753 --> 01:10:17.344 line:82%
Yes. And they tortured him badly.

817
01:10:18.738 --> 01:10:21.898 line:82%
BLACK PRISION

818
01:10:28.696 --> 01:10:30.569 line:82%
Not that one, not that one.

819
01:10:30.782 --> 01:10:33.044 line:82%
It'll hurt like hell.
Not this one.

820
01:10:33.834 --> 01:10:35.690 line:82%
No! It'll hurt.

821
01:10:42.353 --> 01:10:43.785 line:82%
Talk, Pathaan.

822
01:10:44.016 --> 01:10:46.854 line:82%
You know everyone talks
in the end.

823
01:10:47.524 --> 01:10:49.520 line:82%
Your Hindi is damn good.

824
01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:53.235 line:82%
Was your mother in India?
Or a joint operation?

825
01:10:55.646 --> 01:10:58.859 line:82%
I know you can take
a lot of pain.

826
01:10:59.108 --> 01:11:00.308 line:82%
How much more?

827
01:11:04.741 --> 01:11:07.654 line:82%
Pathaan was put into
a high security prison.

828
01:11:08.154 --> 01:11:11.053 line:82%
That's where I last saw him.

829
01:11:28.968 --> 01:11:30.626 line:82%
He's not with us.

830
01:11:31.696 --> 01:11:35.603 line:82%
Oh please, Miss Grewal,
we know he's Marcos's agent.

831
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:38.442 line:82%
He was. He went rogue.

832
01:11:38.897 --> 01:11:41.508 line:82%
Do you think we would sanction
this stupidity?

833
01:11:42.067 --> 01:11:45.150 line:82%
Whatever he's done,
we have no stake in it.

834
01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:50.052 line:82%
So you don't care how we deal
with this situation?

835
01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.908 line:82%
Be my guest.

836
01:11:53.584 --> 01:11:57.098 line:82%
And if this "situation" survives,

837
01:11:57.694 --> 01:11:59.806 line:82%
pump him with two bullets
from me.

838
01:12:01.266 --> 01:12:02.923 line:82%
I'll reimburse you.

839
01:13:08.176 --> 01:13:11.205 line:82%
I'm going to crush your bones
to powder.

840
01:13:11.686 --> 01:13:14.347 line:82%
You're a dead man walking.

841
01:13:30.424 --> 01:13:32.024 line:82%
What was he saying?

842
01:13:36.359 --> 01:13:39.180 line:82%
I'm going to kill you.

843
01:14:33.089 --> 01:14:35.310 line:82%
Guys. Timeout, guys!

844
01:14:35.916 --> 01:14:36.637 line:82%
Please.

845
01:14:37.254 --> 01:14:38.053 line:82%
Wait...

846
01:15:28.397 --> 01:15:29.967 line:82%
Stopped at a coffee shop?

847
01:15:30.244 --> 01:15:31.368 line:82%
And a pharmacy.

848
01:15:31.715 --> 01:15:33.178 line:82%
Here. Painkillers.

849
01:15:33.872 --> 01:15:35.412 line:82%
Men don't feel pain.

850
01:15:37.269 --> 01:15:38.233 line:82%
Take them, brother.

851
01:15:38.896 --> 01:15:40.210 line:82%
They're coming.

852
01:16:02.172 --> 01:16:06.161 line:82%
You've taken it easy too long.
Let's get to work.

853
01:16:29.533 --> 01:16:31.838 line:82%
Tiger, he's got a grenade.

854
01:16:32.151 --> 01:16:34.727 line:82%
- So what!
- I have the pin.

855
01:16:35.492 --> 01:16:37.395 line:82%
When will you stop pulling pins?

856
01:16:38.163 --> 01:16:39.185 line:82%
I'm sorry.

857
01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:01.877 line:82%
I'm having a blast.
Are you?

858
01:17:03.804 --> 01:17:04.821 line:82%
Oh man!

859
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:16.765 line:82%
Behind you!

860
01:17:38.638 --> 01:17:39.836 line:82%
Mission accomplished!

861
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.393 line:82%
Did they come for you?

862
01:17:47.762 --> 01:17:48.653 line:82%
For you.

863
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:51.962 line:82%
You made big trouble,
didn't you?

864
01:17:52.187 --> 01:17:53.363 line:82%
I'm a Pathaan.

865
01:17:53.904 --> 01:17:55.391 line:82%
- Shall we run?
- Me first.

866
01:18:15.384 --> 01:18:16.587 line:82%
You got scared, right?

867
01:18:16.998 --> 01:18:18.169 line:82%
- Yes.
- I know.

868
01:18:18.633 --> 01:18:19.280 line:82%
For you.

869
01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.372 line:82%
Look back!

870
01:20:06.124 --> 01:20:06.581 line:82%
Run!

871
01:20:07.013 --> 01:20:08.558 line:82%
Run. Pathaan, run.

872
01:20:48.486 --> 01:20:49.599 line:82%
Listen.

873
01:20:50.728 --> 01:20:52.828 line:82%
I'm going on a big mission.

874
01:20:54.412 --> 01:20:57.095 line:82%
Tiger may need Pathaan.

875
01:20:57.736 --> 01:20:58.897 line:82%
So stay alive.

876
01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.544 line:82%
I will. I'll be there.

877
01:21:04.803 --> 01:21:06.866 line:82%
Oh, man. I promise.

878
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:08.563 line:82%
- Don't need promises.
- Then what?

879
01:21:08.807 --> 01:21:09.935 line:82%
I need those painkillers.

880
01:21:11.101 --> 01:21:13.624 line:82%
Oh, painkillers. It's here.

881
01:21:17.406 --> 01:21:18.926 line:82%
This is yours, this is mine.

882
01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.016 line:82%
Bitter, isn't it.

883
01:21:28.367 --> 01:21:30.328 line:82%
It's a painkiller.
Not chewing gum.

884
01:21:33.583 --> 01:21:35.353 line:82%
PRESENT DAY

885
01:21:36.131 --> 01:21:38.341 line:82%
So, Tiger helped Pathaan in Russia?

886
01:21:38.667 --> 01:21:40.423 line:82%
How come Pathaan was missing
for so long?

887
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:43.172 line:82%
That was the first time
anyone had defeated Pathaan.

888
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:44.833 line:82%
He swore

889
01:21:45.665 --> 01:21:47.846 line:82%
without Rubai, Jim and Raktbeej

890
01:21:48.329 --> 01:21:50.094 line:82%
he would not return.

891
01:21:50.804 --> 01:21:53.379 line:82%
To maintain diplomatic relations
with Russia,

892
01:21:54.124 --> 01:21:56.535 line:82%
Pathaan's absence suited us.

893
01:21:58.056 --> 01:21:59.190 line:82%
And now?

894
01:21:59.736 --> 01:22:03.811 line:82%
The time of Pathaan's exile is over.

895
01:22:27.011 --> 01:22:29.785 line:82%
"Pump him with two bullets
from me."

896
01:22:30.973 --> 01:22:33.939 line:82%
What could I have said?
"Pathaan's like a son to me,

897
01:22:34.327 --> 01:22:36.340 line:82%
don't torture him too much."

898
01:22:36.973 --> 01:22:39.373 line:82%
Why did Luthra let you go
to Russia?

899
01:22:39.772 --> 01:22:42.635 line:82%
Don't ask. He wanted to go himself.

900
01:22:43.104 --> 01:22:45.393 line:82%
He would've shot you point-blank

901
01:22:45.822 --> 01:22:49.718 line:82%
if he knew the reason I went
there was to give you

902
01:22:51.019 --> 01:22:52.315 line:82%
a message.

903
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:56.049 line:82%
He's not with us.

904
01:22:57.602 --> 01:23:00.535 line:82%
WHY YOU HERE

905
01:23:02.128 --> 01:23:05.354 line:82%
TIGER ON WAY

906
01:23:09.762 --> 01:23:11.652 line:82%
Did Raafe tell you anything?

907
01:23:13.015 --> 01:23:15.101 line:82%
Jim bought two Saber missiles.

908
01:23:15.335 --> 01:23:17.054 line:82%
He doesn't know why,

909
01:23:17.267 --> 01:23:18.540 line:82%
or where Jim is.

910
01:23:19.609 --> 01:23:20.631 line:82%
Or...

911
01:23:21.532 --> 01:23:22.929 line:82%
where she is.

912
01:23:29.522 --> 01:23:31.352 line:82%
Paris? When?

913
01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:33.903 line:82%
A few hours ago.

914
01:23:34.267 --> 01:23:35.770 line:82%
Activity?

915
01:23:36.134 --> 01:23:38.069 line:82%
Walks, cafes.

916
01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:42.106 line:82%
Perhaps she's waiting
for someone.

917
01:23:43.264 --> 01:23:45.579 line:82%
Then I have to go.

918
01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:49.145 line:82%
Can't keep a girl waiting.

919
01:23:49.934 --> 01:23:53.203 line:82%
Pathaan, I don't know what
you stole from the Russians,

920
01:23:53.748 --> 01:23:56.667 line:82%
but I've never seen them
so tense.

921
01:23:57.451 --> 01:23:58.942 line:82%
Find it.

922
01:23:59.533 --> 01:24:00.927 line:82%
Find Jim.

923
01:24:01.891 --> 01:24:03.187 line:82%
Ma'am.

924
01:24:10.464 --> 01:24:12.904 line:82%
PARIS, FRANCE

925
01:25:06.164 --> 01:25:07.328 line:82%
Salaam Alaikum.

926
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:11.560 line:82%
Wa 'alaikumu s-salaam.
May peace be upon on you too.

927
01:25:13.192 --> 01:25:14.198 line:82%
Thank you, Raza.

928
01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:20.919 line:82%
In romantic Paris - two's company,
three's a crowd.

929
01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:24.487 line:82%
I must talk to her about
the pleasures of love.

930
01:25:25.959 --> 01:25:27.075 line:82%
Alone.

931
01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:30.265 line:82%
Alone, Raza.

932
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.284 line:82%
Thank you.

933
01:25:33.602 --> 01:25:36.473 line:82%
You want to talk to me?
Or kill me?

934
01:25:38.343 --> 01:25:41.038 line:82%
I figured when I'd see you again,

935
01:25:41.655 --> 01:25:43.391 line:82%
I'd shoot you first,

936
01:25:43.612 --> 01:25:45.538 line:82%
then ask questions.

937
01:25:48.436 --> 01:25:52.450 line:82%
But you called me here
of your own accord, so...

938
01:25:55.414 --> 01:25:56.995 line:82%
Of course, Rubai,

939
01:25:58.172 --> 01:26:01.561 line:82%
we conveniently got your photo
at the Paris metro.

940
01:26:02.091 --> 01:26:06.200 line:82%
You knew I'd see that CCTV footage.
And I would

941
01:26:08.198 --> 01:26:09.411 line:82%
come to you.

942
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:13.476 line:82%
So, well, I'm here. Tell me quickly
what you have to say.

943
01:26:14.615 --> 01:26:15.754 line:82%
Raktbeej.

944
01:26:19.961 --> 01:26:21.418 line:82%
You want to know what it is?

945
01:26:21.948 --> 01:26:23.242 line:82%
What is it?

946
01:26:27.106 --> 01:26:28.473 line:82%
Smallpox?

947
01:26:30.396 --> 01:26:33.330 line:82%
It was eradicated in 1980.

948
01:26:34.839 --> 01:26:39.839 line:82%
Yes, but some research facilities
still have samples of the virus,

949
01:26:40.398 --> 01:26:43.397 line:82%
in case we need to fight
smallpox again.

950
01:26:44.294 --> 01:26:46.430 line:82%
The virus samples were in Russia.

951
01:26:46.992 --> 01:26:48.164 line:82%
We stole them.

952
01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.248 line:82%
But why?

953
01:26:51.917 --> 01:26:55.323 line:82%
Every country in this world has
a vaccine against smallpox.

954
01:26:58.364 --> 01:27:00.245 line:82%
In case of an emergency outbreak.

955
01:27:00.887 --> 01:27:04.020 line:82%
The vaccine works against
the old smallpox virus.

956
01:27:05.222 --> 01:27:07.143 line:82%
Jim has mutated it.

957
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.664 line:82%
The mutated virus is far
more dangerous.

958
01:27:11.822 --> 01:27:15.605 line:82%
We have no vaccine against it.
No cure either.

959
01:27:16.488 --> 01:27:21.470 line:82%
That's why he planned the big operation
in Dubai to kidnap Dr. Sahani.

960
01:27:30.317 --> 01:27:33.170 line:82%
Who for? Who's paying him?

961
01:27:33.812 --> 01:27:36.166 line:82%
Do you know General Qadir?

962
01:27:40.768 --> 01:27:43.438 line:82%
It's time to befriend the Devil.

963
01:27:46.277 --> 01:27:48.115 line:82%
- Your government?
- No.

964
01:27:48.491 --> 01:27:51.452 line:82%
The General joined forces
with ISI extremists

965
01:27:52.308 --> 01:27:55.691 line:82%
when India abrogated Article 370.

966
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:58.289 line:82%
Pathaan, I swear,

967
01:27:59.318 --> 01:28:01.986 line:82%
I had no idea at all

968
01:28:04.262 --> 01:28:08.481 line:82%
that my own people would
do such a mad thing.

969
01:28:09.088 --> 01:28:11.231 line:82%
If this virus spreads,

970
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.007 line:82%
how can Pakistan save itself?

971
01:28:15.317 --> 01:28:18.211 line:82%
He has changed the virus's DNA.

972
01:28:19.075 --> 01:28:22.208 line:82%
It does not follow the one-week
pattern like Covid-19.

973
01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:25.081 line:82%
This kills within a few hours.

974
01:28:26.205 --> 01:28:29.875 line:82%
Anyone infected by this virus
cannot go very far.

975
01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.667 line:82%
It decimates a whole city in a matter
of days, once it spreads.

976
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:39.302 line:82%
But it can also be contained
within a city's borders.

977
01:28:40.854 --> 01:28:43.096 line:82%
It attacks one city at a time.

978
01:28:44.238 --> 01:28:45.641 line:82%
Not the whole world.

979
01:28:48.055 --> 01:28:49.697 line:82%
But how, Rubai?

980
01:28:52.522 --> 01:28:56.626 line:82%
So why do you think
I can trust you again?

981
01:28:59.112 --> 01:29:01.129 line:82%
I'm a soldier, Pathaan.

982
01:29:02.048 --> 01:29:03.437 line:82%
Like you,

983
01:29:04.795 --> 01:29:07.299 line:82%
I will do anything for my country.

984
01:29:08.162 --> 01:29:09.396 line:82%
But this?

985
01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.412 line:82%
Killing thousands of innocents?
This is not my idea of war.

986
01:29:23.003 --> 01:29:24.654 line:82%
Trust me, Pathaan.

987
01:29:26.435 --> 01:29:28.495 line:82%
Just once more.

988
01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:33.234 line:82%
I'll always have my eye on you.

989
01:29:35.264 --> 01:29:36.317 line:82%
One wrong move...

990
01:29:36.507 --> 01:29:39.508 line:82%
I've made all the wrong moves
I had to.

991
01:29:40.466 --> 01:29:42.765 line:82%
Now I want them erased.

992
01:29:45.432 --> 01:29:47.192 line:82%
Where's Jim?

993
01:29:48.955 --> 01:29:53.010 line:82%
He's meeting Dr. Sahani
in his lab in two days.

994
01:29:56.375 --> 01:29:58.617 line:82%
Tell me about this lab.

995
01:30:00.182 --> 01:30:01.832 line:82%
Everything.

996
01:30:22.502 --> 01:30:24.249 line:82%
So good to see you, sir!

997
01:30:26.001 --> 01:30:28.615 line:82%
If we survive, we'll hug then.
Now, everybody, back to work.

998
01:30:28.844 --> 01:30:30.951 line:82%
I'll never hug you.

999
01:30:32.067 --> 01:30:33.937 line:82%
Only one way. Parachutes.

1000
01:30:34.611 --> 01:30:37.528 line:82%
Land here above the lab
and work your way down there.

1001
01:30:38.464 --> 01:30:39.696 line:82%
Rubai?

1002
01:30:40.954 --> 01:30:41.914 line:82%
Pathaan,

1003
01:30:42.384 --> 01:30:45.184 line:82%
how can you trust her after
what happened in Russia?

1004
01:30:46.534 --> 01:30:50.027 line:82%
OK. We won't trust her.
Next plan?

1005
01:30:50.598 --> 01:30:53.255 line:82%
Use a missile. Blow up the lab.

1006
01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.739 line:82%
And Jim, the virus, the lot.

1007
01:30:56.023 --> 01:30:58.594 line:82%
What if the virus isn't destroyed,
and it gets into the air?

1008
01:30:59.566 --> 01:31:03.456 line:82%
The virus could come down
as rain over three continents.

1009
01:31:04.255 --> 01:31:07.271 line:82%
All right, Pathaan, make it happen.

1010
01:31:07.735 --> 01:31:10.324 line:82%
- Ma'am.
- And get a trim.

1011
01:31:13.836 --> 01:31:14.604 line:82%
OK.

1012
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:44.247 line:82%
Rubai!

1013
01:31:45.494 --> 01:31:46.563 line:82%
Jim.

1014
01:31:48.606 --> 01:31:49.907 line:82%
Looking good.

1015
01:31:50.317 --> 01:31:51.450 line:82%
Always.

1016
01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:53.907 line:82%
But you haven't noticed me before.

1017
01:31:54.287 --> 01:31:57.107 line:82%
Who says love is only at first sight?

1018
01:32:08.795 --> 01:32:10.021 line:82%
Want to drown in them?

1019
01:32:14.783 --> 01:32:17.381 line:82%
I know the difference
between the sea and lava.

1020
01:32:32.935 --> 01:32:34.861 line:82%
Did you design the virus
as instructed?

1021
01:32:51.785 --> 01:32:54.258 line:82%
Are you really going to do this?

1022
01:32:55.491 --> 01:32:56.558 line:82%
For money?

1023
01:32:57.010 --> 01:32:59.299 line:82%
You think this is about money?

1024
01:33:00.268 --> 01:33:03.199 line:82%
I could've easily robbed a bank
blindfolded, Doctor.

1025
01:33:04.994 --> 01:33:07.688 line:82%
I was asked a question once.

1026
01:33:08.529 --> 01:33:10.510 line:82%
"What's your price?

1027
01:33:12.673 --> 01:33:15.073 line:82%
"The price of your family?

1028
01:33:16.015 --> 01:33:17.639 line:82%
"Your child?"

1029
01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:21.965 line:82%
Today you have my answer.

1030
01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:26.631 line:82%
It's I who will decide the price
of your life.

1031
01:33:28.238 --> 01:33:30.809 line:82%
Do you have the power to buy me?
So buy me.

1032
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:33.281 line:82%
This is crazy.

1033
01:33:34.289 --> 01:33:36.638 line:82%
These are your own people.

1034
01:33:37.215 --> 01:33:38.340 line:82%
Your own country.

1035
01:33:39.454 --> 01:33:42.722 line:82%
Oh, Doc! Country, borders, etcetera.

1036
01:33:43.230 --> 01:33:46.473 line:82%
They exist to remind the weak
to stay in their place.

1037
01:33:46.761 --> 01:33:48.740 line:82%
While the real machines
keep turning:

1038
01:33:49.032 --> 01:33:51.481 line:82%
power and control.

1039
01:33:52.355 --> 01:33:55.052 line:82%
I don't care for any country now.

1040
01:33:55.609 --> 01:33:59.221 line:82%
My country is wherever I happen
to be.

1041
01:34:00.678 --> 01:34:01.610 line:82%
That's my world.

1042
01:34:07.443 --> 01:34:08.458 line:82%
SATELITE PREF LOCATION

1043
01:34:12.895 --> 01:34:14.109 line:82%
Let me check.

1044
01:34:38.372 --> 01:34:39.097 line:82%
CENTER D’INNOVATION
ET DE RECHFRCHE

1045
01:34:42.686 --> 01:34:43.773 line:82%
Stay out.

1046
01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:47.353 line:82%
If anything happens to these orbs,
then cut your own throat.

1047
01:35:09.292 --> 01:35:11.701 line:82%
Dr. Sahani. Dr. Sahani.

1048
01:35:12.952 --> 01:35:14.305 line:82%
Give me the orbs.

1049
01:35:26.114 --> 01:35:28.851 line:82%
The orbs are safe. Let's go.

1050
01:35:31.436 --> 01:35:33.110 line:82%
Jim, I was trying to keep
Raktbeej safe...

1051
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:36.002 line:82%
Normally when you lie,
it's so smoothly done.

1052
01:35:37.625 --> 01:35:39.312 line:82%
I'm touched you're scared of me.

1053
01:35:39.573 --> 01:35:42.065 line:82%
- Jim, trust me, I...
- Explain to your people

1054
01:35:43.607 --> 01:35:45.308 line:82%
how you betrayed them.

1055
01:35:46.693 --> 01:35:48.598 line:82%
General Qadir is not "my people".

1056
01:35:50.068 --> 01:35:53.070 line:82%
When my people hear
what he's done,

1057
01:35:53.922 --> 01:35:55.349 line:82%
they'll bloody hang him.

1058
01:35:59.368 --> 01:36:01.080 line:82%
I have a daughter.

1059
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:04.409 line:82%
I wanted you to stay alive
for her sake.

1060
01:36:10.839 --> 01:36:11.839 line:82%
Bag?

1061
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:59.035 line:82%
He must be close.

1062
01:40:48.354 --> 01:40:49.854 line:82%
Give it to me, Pathaan.

1063
01:40:50.413 --> 01:40:51.765 line:82%
No, sir. We have to destroy it.

1064
01:40:52.024 --> 01:40:54.203 line:82%
Right now.

1065
01:40:54.383 --> 01:40:55.869 line:82%
Absolutely not.

1066
01:40:56.837 --> 01:40:59.743 line:82%
Jim has mutated the smallpox virus,

1067
01:41:00.385 --> 01:41:02.025 line:82%
so we need to make a vaccine.

1068
01:41:02.306 --> 01:41:03.670 line:82%
- I don't think so, sir.
- Give it to me.

1069
01:41:04.323 --> 01:41:05.323 line:82%
Sir.

1070
01:41:12.335 --> 01:41:13.489 line:82%
Pathaan!

1071
01:41:14.421 --> 01:41:16.988 line:82%
What the hell, sir?
What's going on?

1072
01:41:17.218 --> 01:41:18.545 line:82%
She's ISI, Pathaan.

1073
01:41:18.765 --> 01:41:21.460 line:82%
We have the virus orb,
thanks to her.

1074
01:41:21.855 --> 01:41:24.088 line:82%
And thanks to her,
the virus landed in Jim's hands.

1075
01:41:25.338 --> 01:41:27.012 line:82%
She knows Jim's plans.

1076
01:41:30.373 --> 01:41:32.198 line:82%
- We have to question her, Pathaan.
- Ma'am...

1077
01:41:32.399 --> 01:41:34.016 line:82%
Besides, where can she go now?

1078
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.760 line:82%
Jim and the ISI are looking
for her.

1079
01:41:37.332 --> 01:41:40.877 line:82%
If we let her go,
she won't survive for two days.

1080
01:41:42.469 --> 01:41:44.031 line:82%
- Take her.
- Wait.

1081
01:41:52.133 --> 01:41:53.150 line:82%
Pathaan...

1082
01:41:56.114 --> 01:41:57.231 line:82%
You'll be OK.

1083
01:41:59.852 --> 01:42:01.652 line:82%
Pathaan's promise.

1084
01:42:11.908 --> 01:42:12.776 line:82%
Where's Jim?

1085
01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:15.662 line:82%
- Where's the anti-virus?
- What is the missile's target?

1086
01:42:15.832 --> 01:42:17.323 line:82%
You know his plans.

1087
01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.092 line:82%
You think we believe
you know nothing?

1088
01:42:20.251 --> 01:42:21.460 line:82%
No one knows anything.

1089
01:42:21.695 --> 01:42:24.600 line:82%
What Jim thinks or plans,
only Jim knows.

1090
01:42:24.981 --> 01:42:28.124 line:82%
If anything goes wrong,
he has a backup plan.

1091
01:42:28.424 --> 01:42:30.854 line:82%
Things may be going wrong
for him right now,

1092
01:42:31.048 --> 01:42:32.950 line:82%
but soon his backup plan
will kick in.

1093
01:42:33.319 --> 01:42:36.616 line:82%
This screw-up must have been
planned by Jim.

1094
01:42:36.996 --> 01:42:39.709 line:82%
INDIAN INSTITUTE OF
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES

1095
01:42:51.271 --> 01:42:53.220 line:82%
Ma'am, you'll have to wear this suit.

1096
01:42:54.726 --> 01:42:55.748 line:82%
Yes, Doctor?

1097
01:42:56.028 --> 01:42:57.512 line:82%
I got your message.

1098
01:42:57.706 --> 01:42:59.173 line:82%
Come, Nandini.
I must show you something.

1099
01:42:59.329 --> 01:43:00.190 line:82%
Show me.

1100
01:43:00.387 --> 01:43:02.970 line:82%
There are three layers
to get to the orb's core.

1101
01:43:04.116 --> 01:43:07.342 line:82%
- Did you cut through?
- We got to the central core.

1102
01:43:07.565 --> 01:43:10.406 line:82%
- Where the virus is.
- It was empty.

1103
01:43:10.773 --> 01:43:11.643 line:82%
What?

1104
01:43:11.863 --> 01:43:15.381 line:82%
We analysed the liquid carefully.
It's water. Only water.

1105
01:43:18.724 --> 01:43:19.978 line:82%
What happened to the lights?

1106
01:43:20.173 --> 01:43:22.181 line:82%
Ma'am, our system has been hacked.

1107
01:43:22.414 --> 01:43:24.122 line:82%
There's an incoming video call.

1108
01:43:24.312 --> 01:43:25.312 line:82%
It's Jim.

1109
01:43:25.785 --> 01:43:26.620 line:82%
Connect him.

1110
01:43:30.650 --> 01:43:33.264 line:82%
Hello, hello. How's everyone?

1111
01:43:33.671 --> 01:43:34.672 line:82%
Was it fun?

1112
01:43:34.873 --> 01:43:38.322 line:82%
Finding only pure distilled
mineral water in the orb?

1113
01:43:38.699 --> 01:43:40.564 line:82%
What the hell are you
playing at, Jim?

1114
01:43:40.921 --> 01:43:44.634 line:82%
Just following my plan in case
anyone tried to force the orbs open.

1115
01:43:44.894 --> 01:43:46.504 line:82%
The orb has three layers.

1116
01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:48.872 line:82%
The first layer was empty.

1117
01:43:49.243 --> 01:43:50.319 line:82%
Only a vacuum.

1118
01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:53.065 line:82%
The second layer wasn't empty.

1119
01:43:53.401 --> 01:43:55.597 line:82%
It contained an invisible
corrosive gas.

1120
01:43:55.948 --> 01:44:00.069 line:82%
It's an acid that melts plastic
on contact.

1121
01:44:00.455 --> 01:44:02.263 line:82%
Your plastic suits, for example.

1122
01:44:04.152 --> 01:44:06.618 line:82%
The third layer contained
my superstar.

1123
01:44:09.095 --> 01:44:10.170 line:82%
Raktbeej.

1124
01:44:11.318 --> 01:44:13.084 line:82%
The virus is now all over the lab.

1125
01:44:13.699 --> 01:44:16.977 line:82%
In the orb's centre, you'll find
clean safe mineral water.

1126
01:44:17.336 --> 01:44:20.785 line:82%
You won't feel thirsty
when you're dying.

1127
01:44:22.462 --> 01:44:23.714 line:82%
You think I'm bluffing?

1128
01:44:24.128 --> 01:44:26.302 line:82%
Look at your pretty white suits.

1129
01:44:28.119 --> 01:44:30.130 line:82%
Are they turning black?

1130
01:44:31.216 --> 01:44:33.112 line:82%
Your suits are of no use now.

1131
01:44:33.361 --> 01:44:35.461 line:82%
The virus you were looking for
in the water

1132
01:44:35.834 --> 01:44:38.112 line:82%
is invading your whole body.

1133
01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.781 line:82%
If pain is measured on
a scale of 10,

1134
01:44:47.405 --> 01:44:50.071 line:82%
you'll experience it at 13 or 14.

1135
01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:52.339 line:82%
Exciting, right?

1136
01:44:52.810 --> 01:44:55.103 line:82%
A demo of Raktbeej.

1137
01:44:57.392 --> 01:45:01.266 line:82%
So please, share your dying moments
on Instagram and Twitter.

1138
01:45:01.638 --> 01:45:04.461 line:82%
Things that are seen - they sell.

1139
01:45:06.769 --> 01:45:07.639 line:82%
Cheers.

1140
01:45:09.082 --> 01:45:10.082 line:82%
No!

1141
01:45:10.665 --> 01:45:11.905 line:82%
Lock down the lab.

1142
01:45:12.151 --> 01:45:13.217 line:82%
Lock the lab!

1143
01:45:14.491 --> 01:45:16.494 line:82%
Lock the lab!

1144
01:45:16.926 --> 01:45:20.234 line:82%
All the others, get out!

1145
01:45:20.586 --> 01:45:22.010 line:82%
We're sealing the lab.

1146
01:45:26.327 --> 01:45:28.701 line:82%
Get out, all of you.

1147
01:45:34.195 --> 01:45:37.232 line:82%
We can decontaminate the atmosphere.

1148
01:45:37.535 --> 01:45:39.405 line:82%
UV radiation, gamma rays.

1149
01:45:39.671 --> 01:45:41.961 line:82%
But how can you decontaminate us,
Luthra?

1150
01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:44.228 line:82%
The virus is inside us.

1151
01:45:52.965 --> 01:45:54.217 line:82%
There's only one way.

1152
01:46:09.632 --> 01:46:14.374 line:82%
Very few people get the chance
to decide how they'll face their death.

1153
01:46:15.168 --> 01:46:18.361 line:82%
With fear? Hesitation?
Or will they panic?

1154
01:46:20.161 --> 01:46:25.161 line:82%
I will not give a bloody terrorist
that satisfaction.

1155
01:46:25.921 --> 01:46:27.742 line:82%
I'm a soldier.

1156
01:46:29.137 --> 01:46:30.370 line:82%
And now,

1157
01:46:31.713 --> 01:46:32.833 line:82%
all of you are too.

1158
01:46:34.543 --> 01:46:36.735 line:82%
Everyone dies someday,

1159
01:46:38.472 --> 01:46:40.196 line:82%
today it's our turn.

1160
01:46:43.974 --> 01:46:45.439 line:82%
Accept it.

1161
01:47:03.166 --> 01:47:05.909 line:82%
Colonel, you know what to do.

1162
01:47:23.085 --> 01:47:24.931 line:82%
Don't save RDX.

1163
01:47:25.468 --> 01:47:27.594 line:82%
We'll be dead anyway.

1164
01:47:28.185 --> 01:47:31.096 line:82%
Just make sure the virus
does not spread.

1165
01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.473 line:82%
Thank you.

1166
01:47:34.875 --> 01:47:36.111 line:82%
Thank you, everyone.

1167
01:47:36.789 --> 01:47:39.113 line:82%
It was a great honour serving with you.

1168
01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:44.550 line:82%
You're the molten gold
that kept my life together.

1169
01:47:49.147 --> 01:47:50.147 line:82%
Ma'am...

1170
01:47:54.316 --> 01:47:57.020 line:82%
You are that gold now, Pathaan.

1171
01:47:58.022 --> 01:47:59.772 line:82%
You'll keep everyone together,

1172
01:48:00.930 --> 01:48:02.863 line:82%
and make them strong.

1173
01:48:03.364 --> 01:48:05.029 line:82%
You were always

1174
01:48:07.996 --> 01:48:09.787 line:82%
the one who kept us together.

1175
01:48:18.887 --> 01:48:19.970 line:82%
Don't stop.

1176
01:48:20.795 --> 01:48:21.922 line:82%
Get Jim.

1177
01:48:27.368 --> 01:48:29.887 line:82%
I promise, ma'am.

1178
01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:32.955 line:82%
Make him die a death

1179
01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:36.421 line:82%
far worse than ours.

1180
01:48:45.957 --> 01:48:47.224 line:82%
Ma'am.

1181
01:49:15.141 --> 01:49:16.767 line:82%
I hate guns.

1182
01:49:19.639 --> 01:49:21.165 line:82%
In the name of Lord Shiva!

1183
01:49:53.506 --> 01:49:55.364 line:82%
Hello, everyone.

1184
01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:58.568 line:82%
I know this is a bad time
for all of you.

1185
01:49:59.301 --> 01:50:01.185 line:82%
I respect your pain.

1186
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:04.944 line:82%
So, I'll do my best not to appear
too cheerful.

1187
01:50:05.745 --> 01:50:06.795 line:82%
But come on!

1188
01:50:07.861 --> 01:50:09.651 line:82%
It was some plan!

1189
01:50:10.157 --> 01:50:11.601 line:82%
You should be impressed.

1190
01:50:12.026 --> 01:50:13.740 line:82%
You were an Indian soldier. Dammit!

1191
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:17.201 line:82%
And thanks to you, I'm an
Indian businessman now.

1192
01:50:17.772 --> 01:50:20.774 line:82%
If you survive, you might become
a client of mine.

1193
01:50:20.985 --> 01:50:24.527 line:82%
Then I'll get you anything you want.
Right now, I serve another client.

1194
01:50:24.782 --> 01:50:26.409 line:82%
I'm doing what he wants.

1195
01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:28.524 line:82%
Do you even realise
what you're doing?

1196
01:50:28.813 --> 01:50:30.982 line:82%
You're unleashing your wrath
on humanity.

1197
01:50:31.271 --> 01:50:33.467 line:82%
History will remember you
as a monster.

1198
01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:36.071 line:82%
Oh ho! That never occurred to me.

1199
01:50:36.497 --> 01:50:39.307 line:82%
What can I do? Everything is ready.

1200
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:44.175 line:82%
My Saber missile.
Armed and ready.

1201
01:50:44.672 --> 01:50:47.839 line:82%
It's in a location that only I know.

1202
01:50:48.468 --> 01:50:49.283 line:82%
The target?

1203
01:50:49.964 --> 01:50:53.175 line:82%
An Indian city, that only I know.

1204
01:50:53.828 --> 01:50:55.069 line:82%
Such a pity!

1205
01:50:55.473 --> 01:50:59.979 line:82%
You blew up your lab before you could
see what Raktbeej was capable of.

1206
01:51:00.408 --> 01:51:03.884 line:82%
But when it spreads in Delhi,
Mumbai, Hyderabad or Amritsar,

1207
01:51:05.441 --> 01:51:06.687 line:82%
what will you do?

1208
01:51:07.022 --> 01:51:08.568 line:82%
Blow up those cities?

1209
01:51:08.925 --> 01:51:09.978 line:82%
What do you want?

1210
01:51:10.251 --> 01:51:13.413 line:82%
I want you to negotiate with
a terrorist, Colonel Luthra.

1211
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:17.811 line:82%
You didn't do it for me.
Now you'll negotiate with me.

1212
01:51:18.889 --> 01:51:21.600 line:82%
What do you want?

1213
01:51:22.161 --> 01:51:24.064 line:82%
What do you think?

1214
01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:26.940 line:82%
Kashmir.

1215
01:51:27.947 --> 01:51:29.955 line:82%
Obviously, Kashmir.

1216
01:51:31.437 --> 01:51:33.029 line:82%
You have 24 hours.

1217
01:51:33.796 --> 01:51:36.577 line:82%
After 24 hours, if a single soldier,

1218
01:51:37.254 --> 01:51:43.575 line:82%
a single tank, a single gun or the
Indian flag is seen in Kashmir, then...

1219
01:51:43.961 --> 01:51:45.502 line:82%
That's impossible.

1220
01:51:45.951 --> 01:51:48.167 line:82%
How can I make that happen
in 24 hours?

1221
01:51:49.032 --> 01:51:50.777 line:82%
We need time to think.

1222
01:51:51.017 --> 01:51:53.794 line:82%
Perhaps I used the wrong word,
that's why you're confused.

1223
01:51:54.597 --> 01:51:56.793 line:82%
This is not a negotiation,
Colonel Luthra,

1224
01:51:57.076 --> 01:51:58.762 line:82%
it's an ultimatum.

1225
01:51:59.483 --> 01:52:01.001 line:82%
Your time starts...

1226
01:52:03.523 --> 01:52:04.274 line:82%
now.

1227
01:52:08.163 --> 01:52:11.802 line:82%
The situation you're in,
the fear that's overcoming you,

1228
01:52:12.323 --> 01:52:13.670 line:82%
I've been there.

1229
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:20.968 line:82%
No one took responsibility for the
death of my wife and unborn child.

1230
01:52:21.907 --> 01:52:25.043 line:82%
And now no one is responsible
for your death.

1231
01:52:26.653 --> 01:52:28.311 line:82%
How does it feel, guys?

1232
01:52:29.705 --> 01:52:32.190 line:82%
It's not appropriate to say "Jai Hind".

1233
01:52:32.578 --> 01:52:35.875 line:82%
So, take care.
Time is running out.

1234
01:52:38.961 --> 01:52:42.175 line:82%
Pathaan, you have to stop
this madman.

1235
01:52:46.835 --> 01:52:48.907 line:82%
Look! Your innocent family.

1236
01:52:49.252 --> 01:52:51.832 line:82%
You know what we'll do to them?

1237
01:52:54.785 --> 01:52:59.392 line:82%
Whichever city the missile strikes,
that's where your family will be.

1238
01:53:01.532 --> 01:53:03.108 line:82%
Where is that missile?

1239
01:53:03.465 --> 01:53:04.649 line:82%
My job

1240
01:53:05.267 --> 01:53:07.817 line:82%
was only to make payment.

1241
01:53:09.968 --> 01:53:13.391 line:82%
I said Jim would tell them
where to deliver it.

1242
01:53:16.019 --> 01:53:19.532 line:82%
If you don't know the city,
you must know the country.

1243
01:53:20.329 --> 01:53:21.571 line:82%
Where?

1244
01:53:25.347 --> 01:53:26.845 line:82%
Afghanistan.

1245
01:53:32.368 --> 01:53:32.955 line:82%
Father!

1246
01:53:34.398 --> 01:53:35.192 line:82%
Father!

1247
01:54:06.343 --> 01:54:07.630 line:82%
I am sorry, Rubai.

1248
01:54:07.886 --> 01:54:09.678 line:82%
Fear blinds people.

1249
01:54:12.691 --> 01:54:14.215 line:82%
But you can see,

1250
01:54:16.519 --> 01:54:18.162 line:82%
I'm not your enemy.

1251
01:54:18.646 --> 01:54:19.924 line:82%
I know.

1252
01:54:26.534 --> 01:54:28.056 line:82%
I shouldn't do this.

1253
01:54:31.894 --> 01:54:33.020 line:82%
It's wrong.

1254
01:54:33.630 --> 01:54:34.917 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1255
01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:37.442 line:82%
Pathaan?

1256
01:54:37.973 --> 01:54:39.239 line:82%
Not to you.

1257
01:54:39.707 --> 01:54:40.546 line:82%
To you!

1258
01:54:48.333 --> 01:54:49.671 line:82%
I said sorry.

1259
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:58.458 line:82%
AFGHANISTAN

1260
01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:07.915 line:82%
All calm, General?

1261
01:55:08.146 --> 01:55:10.511 line:82%
I don't want calm, I want havoc.

1262
01:55:11.670 --> 01:55:13.357 line:82%
India will not give Kashmir,
General.

1263
01:55:13.892 --> 01:55:14.857 line:82%
So...

1264
01:55:15.542 --> 01:55:16.934 line:82%
do we teach them a lesson?

1265
01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:23.881 line:82%
The missile is ready.

1266
01:55:24.096 --> 01:55:26.897 line:82%
You just have to press the button
and I have to get paid.

1267
01:55:27.147 --> 01:55:28.068 line:82%
PROCESSING CODE
MISSILE STATE UNARMED

1268
01:55:28.285 --> 01:55:29.680 line:82%
Then boom!

1269
01:55:31.806 --> 01:55:32.779 line:82%
ENTER AMOUNT

1270
01:55:35.701 --> 01:55:36.727 line:82%
General.

1271
01:55:37.474 --> 01:55:38.463 line:82%
Sir.

1272
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:43.922 line:82%
Everyone in my village was struck
by a strange disease.

1273
01:55:44.230 --> 01:55:46.600 line:82%
They're all dead now.

1274
01:55:46.819 --> 01:55:48.928 line:82%
A metal ball fell here and no one
survived after that.

1275
01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:50.629 line:82%
What are they saying?

1276
01:55:50.955 --> 01:55:53.589 line:82%
The video is from an Afghan village,
some 200 kms away.

1277
01:55:53.939 --> 01:55:55.672 line:82%
The local TV is saying

1278
01:55:55.928 --> 01:55:57.806 line:82%
a strange virus is spreading
through the village.

1279
01:55:58.305 --> 01:56:00.296 line:82%
It has the same symptoms as

1280
01:56:02.083 --> 01:56:03.570 line:82%
smallpox.

1281
01:56:06.841 --> 01:56:08.023 line:82%
That's...

1282
01:56:08.818 --> 01:56:09.779 line:82%
that's impossible.

1283
01:56:11.006 --> 01:56:11.997 line:82%
Raktbeej.

1284
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:16.017 line:82%
How can it be Raktbeej?

1285
01:56:16.793 --> 01:56:18.458 line:82%
One orb is on the missile,

1286
01:56:20.216 --> 01:56:22.431 line:82%
the other was destroyed
in India.

1287
01:56:23.057 --> 01:56:24.637 line:82%
Either you're a fool,

1288
01:56:26.373 --> 01:56:28.015 line:82%
or you think I am.

1289
01:56:29.626 --> 01:56:31.464 line:82%
If you want all your money,

1290
01:56:31.674 --> 01:56:34.876 line:82%
find out how this other Raktbeej
landed there.

1291
01:56:39.368 --> 01:56:42.818 line:82%
You're mistaken If you think
I'm your friend,

1292
01:56:44.081 --> 01:56:46.345 line:82%
or that I have sympathy
towards Pakistan.

1293
01:56:46.899 --> 01:56:48.655 line:82%
Or that I need money.

1294
01:56:49.236 --> 01:56:51.176 line:82%
You haven't understood me,
General.

1295
01:56:52.429 --> 01:56:56.027 line:82%
I am the demon Raktbeej.

1296
01:56:56.618 --> 01:56:57.434 line:82%
Leave me!

1297
01:56:57.744 --> 01:57:00.402 line:82%
If you want to see a free show,
why pick on Delhi?

1298
01:57:01.578 --> 01:57:03.085 line:82%
Change the co-ordinates.

1299
01:57:04.781 --> 01:57:06.888 line:82%
Let's party in Islamabad.

1300
01:57:07.153 --> 01:57:10.562 line:82%
No, sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't do that.

1301
01:57:14.777 --> 01:57:16.031 line:82%
You handle it yourself, right?

1302
01:57:18.386 --> 01:57:20.076 line:82%
Exactly as you told me.

1303
01:57:20.439 --> 01:57:22.372 line:82%
I don't know where it came from.

1304
01:57:25.054 --> 01:57:26.802 line:82%
Find out what's going on.

1305
01:57:27.212 --> 01:57:29.161 line:82%
Who's behind this?

1306
01:57:29.924 --> 01:57:31.638 line:82%
I want the answer,

1307
01:57:32.363 --> 01:57:33.976 line:82%
and his head.

1308
01:57:35.254 --> 01:57:36.638 line:82%
I want both.

1309
01:58:04.090 --> 01:58:05.052 line:82%
How?

1310
01:58:05.949 --> 01:58:07.087 line:82%
Welcome!

1311
01:58:14.513 --> 01:58:15.552 line:82%
To my home!

1312
01:58:17.235 --> 01:58:18.925 line:82%
This is my Afghan family.

1313
01:58:19.731 --> 01:58:21.037 line:82%
My people.

1314
01:58:23.253 --> 01:58:24.550 line:82%
Our Pathaan.

1315
01:58:44.846 --> 01:58:45.857 line:82%
What did you find there?

1316
01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:48.356 line:82%
The man who stands before you.

1317
01:58:52.104 --> 01:58:53.058 line:82%
Pathaan.

1318
01:59:03.535 --> 01:59:05.618 line:82%
You have this nasty habit.

1319
01:59:06.163 --> 01:59:08.523 line:82%
You smell a party and arrive uninvited.

1320
01:59:09.985 --> 01:59:13.284 line:82%
Never ever invited to a bash,
Pathaan just loves to gatecrash.

1321
01:59:14.028 --> 01:59:16.537 line:82%
If you have a party
in Pathaan's home,

1322
01:59:16.893 --> 01:59:20.016 line:82%
he has to be there
to welcome you,

1323
01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:23.000 line:82%
with some fireworks.

1324
01:59:24.363 --> 01:59:25.514 line:82%
Some joke, General!

1325
01:59:26.321 --> 01:59:30.345 line:82%
Another of your agents has
fallen in love with the enemy.

1326
01:59:31.934 --> 01:59:34.124 line:82%
First there was Zoya and Tiger.

1327
01:59:35.356 --> 01:59:36.211 line:82%
And now...

1328
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:46.691 line:82%
Has ISI turned into some dating website
for Indian agents?

1329
01:59:46.883 --> 01:59:47.286 line:82%
MISSILE STATE
UNARMED

1330
01:59:52.150 --> 01:59:53.136 line:82%
MISSILE STATE
ARMED 02:44

1331
02:00:00.308 --> 02:00:01.480 line:82%
Pathaan!

1332
02:00:06.281 --> 02:00:08.572 line:82%
- Raza.
- Pathaan.

1333
02:00:20.968 --> 02:00:23.232 line:82%
Pathaan, Jim isn't a man to give up.

1334
02:00:23.697 --> 02:00:24.766 line:82%
There must be...

1335
02:00:32.159 --> 02:00:35.060 line:82%
Amol, see if the orb can be
detached from the missile.

1336
02:00:35.354 --> 02:00:36.301 line:82%
- Yes sir.
- Duck.

1337
02:00:38.645 --> 02:00:39.637 line:82%
Let's do this, man.

1338
02:00:39.874 --> 02:00:40.795 line:82%
MISSILE STATE
ARMED 01:49

1339
02:00:42.292 --> 02:00:44.106 line:82%
I'll deactivate the missile.

1340
02:04:26.482 --> 02:04:27.751 line:82%
Where's the orb?

1341
02:04:28.087 --> 02:04:30.712 line:82%
Pathaan, the missile
was only a diversion.

1342
02:04:31.131 --> 02:04:32.602 line:82%
The real Raktbeej isn't here.

1343
02:04:34.408 --> 02:04:36.474 line:82%
Jim had another plan all along.

1344
02:05:12.276 --> 02:05:14.742 line:82%
Where is Raktbeej?
What is Jim's real plan?

1345
02:05:14.938 --> 02:05:16.557 line:82%
You traitor, I will...

1346
02:05:17.304 --> 02:05:20.519 line:82%
Wait! Only Sergei knows.

1347
02:05:20.962 --> 02:05:21.843 line:82%
Sergei.

1348
02:05:39.048 --> 02:05:40.702 line:82%
Flight LT-72.

1349
02:05:49.771 --> 02:05:52.485 line:82%
Pathaan and Colonel Luthra,
listen to me.

1350
02:05:52.859 --> 02:05:54.086 line:82%
Raktbeej is on a plane.

1351
02:05:54.855 --> 02:05:57.402 line:82%
Flight LT-72. It's circling Delhi
right now.

1352
02:05:58.299 --> 02:06:01.846 line:82%
If the orb can be deactivated,

1353
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:03.616 line:82%
only Jim knows how.

1354
02:06:03.827 --> 02:06:05.673 line:82%
Connect me to air traffic control.
Now!

1355
02:06:08.701 --> 02:06:10.828 line:82%
Pathaan, find Jim.

1356
02:06:11.372 --> 02:06:12.181 line:82%
Yes.

1357
02:06:29.985 --> 02:06:31.856 line:82%
Flight LT-72, do you hear me?

1358
02:06:32.267 --> 02:06:35.366 line:82%
Ground Air Control, this is
Captain Mehra from Flight LT-72.

1359
02:06:35.571 --> 02:06:38.631 line:82%
Landing permission denied.
I repeat, landing permission denied.

1360
02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:39.641 line:82%
What?

1361
02:06:47.225 --> 02:06:50.448 line:82%
Raktbeej is sitting happily
in a plane over Delhi now.

1362
02:06:52.551 --> 02:06:54.489 line:82%
The orb has six minutes left.

1363
02:06:57.376 --> 02:06:58.415 line:82%
And so does Delhi.

1364
02:06:59.927 --> 02:07:01.369 line:82%
In six minutes, the virus

1365
02:07:02.563 --> 02:07:05.521 line:82%
will spread through the plane's
AC ducts.

1366
02:07:06.056 --> 02:07:07.347 line:82%
Unless

1367
02:07:08.431 --> 02:07:11.179 line:82%
you can grab this detonator switch
from me.

1368
02:07:13.723 --> 02:07:14.751 line:82%
What a pity!

1369
02:07:17.093 --> 02:07:17.913 line:82%
It's unlikely.

1370
02:07:25.633 --> 02:07:27.654 line:82%
Captain Mehra, this is Colonel
Luthra from RAW.

1371
02:07:27.882 --> 02:07:29.632 line:82%
There's a biological weapon
on board.

1372
02:07:30.039 --> 02:07:31.896 line:82%
The device is in your AC ducts.

1373
02:07:32.096 --> 02:07:32.985 line:82%
What?

1374
02:07:33.675 --> 02:07:36.653 line:82%
What am I supposed to do, Colonel?
We're running low on fuel.

1375
02:07:36.952 --> 02:07:39.020 line:82%
Captain, you're carrying
a very dangerous weapon.

1376
02:07:39.444 --> 02:07:41.708 line:82%
Fly as far as you can from Delhi,
please.

1377
02:08:25.759 --> 02:08:27.073 line:82%
CONNECTING TO WI-FI.
CONNECTED

1378
02:08:27.667 --> 02:08:28.863 line:82%
I found it, Colonel.

1379
02:08:29.857 --> 02:08:31.965 line:82%
Only four minutes to go.

1380
02:08:34.224 --> 02:08:35.440 line:82%
Get me the minister.

1381
02:09:00.641 --> 02:09:01.781 line:82%
Yes, sir.

1382
02:09:02.181 --> 02:09:03.923 line:82%
There is no other option.

1383
02:09:05.165 --> 02:09:06.222 line:82%
Jai Hind.

1384
02:09:07.341 --> 02:09:08.854 line:82%
- Connect me to missile command.
- Yes, sir.

1385
02:09:39.449 --> 02:09:42.199 line:82%
Captain, we will have
to destroy the plane.

1386
02:09:42.434 --> 02:09:44.760 line:82%
There must be another way, Colonel.

1387
02:09:45.452 --> 02:09:49.339 line:82%
I have 300 passengers
and many children on board.

1388
02:09:52.248 --> 02:09:55.401 line:82%
Right now, your plane is more
dangerous than a nuclear bomb.

1389
02:09:55.777 --> 02:09:58.795 line:82%
I'm sorry. We...can't save you.

1390
02:10:06.314 --> 02:10:08.991 line:82%
Missile Control,
initiate strike protocol.

1391
02:10:15.656 --> 02:10:16.787 line:82%
Come on, Pathaan.

1392
02:10:18.799 --> 02:10:20.482 line:82%
There's only one option.

1393
02:10:20.708 --> 02:10:22.349 line:82%
Remember how you sacrificed
your scientists?

1394
02:10:23.407 --> 02:10:25.598 line:82%
Play "Vande Mataram"
on the plane

1395
02:10:25.988 --> 02:10:27.337 line:82%
and blow up the passengers.

1396
02:10:27.578 --> 02:10:28.329 line:82%
Fire.

1397
02:10:33.376 --> 02:10:36.996 line:82%
My family's lives were sacrificed.
Now it's your turn to make a sacrifice.

1398
02:11:53.716 --> 02:11:55.405 line:82%
Farewell, Pathaan.

1399
02:12:15.722 --> 02:12:18.307 line:82%
The timer has stopped, sir.
Please stop the missile.

1400
02:12:18.476 --> 02:12:20.017 line:82%
Abort, abort, abort!

1401
02:12:26.678 --> 02:12:28.461 line:82%
Yes...yes!

1402
02:12:31.094 --> 02:12:32.990 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain here.

1403
02:12:33.173 --> 02:12:35.985 line:82%
Please buckle up because
we're about to land in Delhi.

1404
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:18.808 line:82%
You couldn't understand
something very simple.

1405
02:13:20.458 --> 02:13:22.903 line:82%
A soldier does not ask

1406
02:13:23.498 --> 02:13:25.339 line:82%
what his country can do for him.

1407
02:13:27.471 --> 02:13:28.799 line:82%
He asks

1408
02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:32.364 line:82%
what he can do for his country.

1409
02:13:46.335 --> 02:13:48.262 line:82%
You don't deserve this, Jim.

1410
02:14:00.249 --> 02:14:03.443 line:82%
Give your Mother India
my last goodbye.

1411
02:14:08.117 --> 02:14:09.583 line:82%
Jai Hind.

1412
02:15:00.239 --> 02:15:04.304 line:82%
DIRECTOR
SIDDHARTH ANAND

1413
02:15:04.619 --> 02:15:08.596 line:82%
PRODUCER
ADITYA CHOPRA

1414
02:15:19.633 --> 02:15:23.602 line:82%
If anyone merits this medal,
it's you.

1415
02:15:24.615 --> 02:15:27.706 line:82%
I've never met a braver soldier
than you,

1416
02:15:30.809 --> 02:15:32.054 line:82%
ma'am.

1417
02:15:33.355 --> 02:15:34.122 line:82%
Pathaan.

1418
02:15:36.304 --> 02:15:38.069 line:82%
Colonel, good news.

1419
02:15:38.409 --> 02:15:39.505 line:82%
I'm leaving.

1420
02:15:39.805 --> 02:15:43.100 line:82%
So you won't suffer from acidity
and blood pressure anymore.

1421
02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:46.798 line:82%
Our paths are separate now.

1422
02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:49.550 line:82%
- Thank you, sir.
- The war is not over, Pathaan.

1423
02:15:51.401 --> 02:15:53.487 line:82%
- We need you.
- Me?

1424
02:15:54.481 --> 02:15:58.301 line:82%
But we are ...what did you
call us? Broken eggshells?

1425
02:15:58.624 --> 02:16:00.493 line:82%
I admit mistakes were made,
Pathaan.

1426
02:16:02.126 --> 02:16:05.755 line:82%
But this country cannot be saved
by Colonel Luthra alone.

1427
02:16:06.545 --> 02:16:09.649 line:82%
Or by Tiger or Kabir.

1428
02:16:11.679 --> 02:16:12.926 line:82%
Or even by Pathaan.

1429
02:16:13.895 --> 02:16:15.210 line:82%
Everyone is needed.

1430
02:16:18.654 --> 02:16:21.193 line:82%
There are many soldiers like them,
Pathaan.

1431
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:24.855 line:82%
Some with wounded bodies,
others with damaged souls.

1432
02:16:25.692 --> 02:16:30.360 line:82%
But they are ready to sacrifice
their lives for this country.

1433
02:16:31.086 --> 02:16:35.072 line:82%
These broken folk can only be
put together with the gold

1434
02:16:37.682 --> 02:16:39.522 line:82%
that has lived through fire.

1435
02:16:42.118 --> 02:16:43.976 line:82%
And that person is you.

1436
02:16:45.366 --> 02:16:48.426 line:82%
Make the sharpest sword, Pathaan,

1437
02:16:49.024 --> 02:16:52.203 line:82%
so the souls' of the enemy tremble.

1438
02:16:54.165 --> 02:16:56.165 line:82%
But who will wield that sword?

1439
02:16:56.681 --> 02:16:59.263 line:82%
Who will it strike?
How will it strike?

1440
02:17:00.143 --> 02:17:01.386 line:82%
Who decides that?

1441
02:17:02.076 --> 02:17:03.166 line:82%
The sword is yours.

1442
02:17:05.265 --> 02:17:07.345 line:82%
So it is your call.

1443
02:17:12.333 --> 02:17:14.832 line:82%
Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.

1444
02:17:15.530 --> 02:17:17.019 line:82%
- Let's start.
- Yes, sir.

1445
02:17:18.512 --> 02:17:19.695 line:82%
Sorry, sir.

1446
02:17:20.324 --> 02:17:22.705 line:82%
I have an urgent appointment.

1447
02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:24.219 line:82%

Yeah.

1499
02:21:17.328 --> 02:21:21.495 line:82%
I've been thinking, it's been 30 years,
we should stop.

1500
02:21:24.517 --> 02:21:26.284 line:82%
But who'll replace us?

1501
02:21:26.745 --> 02:21:27.856 line:82%
Hmm?

1502
02:21:31.185 --> 02:21:33.769 line:82%
There's that guy.

That guy.

1504
02:21:38.671 --> 02:21:39.738 line:82%
No?

1505
02:21:42.174 --> 02:21:43.841 line:82%
What about that other guy?

1506
02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:45.745 line:82%
He has something.

1507
02:21:46.697 --> 02:21:48.503 line:82%
No, not him.

1508
02:21:50.084 --> 02:21:51.704 line:82%
He's got no style. Nah!

1509
02:21:53.205 --> 02:21:54.612 line:82%
Never mind.

1510
02:21:57.158 --> 02:21:58.352 line:82%
And him?

1511
02:22:02.028 --> 02:22:03.113 line:82%
No.

1512
02:22:08.478 --> 02:22:10.324 line:82%
It's up to us, Bhai.

1513
02:22:10.904 --> 02:22:14.351 line:82%
Our country is at stake.
We can't leave it to kids.

1514
02:22:15.689 --> 02:22:17.460 line:82%
Let's go.

1515
02:22:18.361 --> 02:22:20.714 line:82%
Help me up. Lift me up.

1516
02:22:22.722 --> 02:22:23.792 line:82%
Lower back.

1517
02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:15.849 line:82%
When all the world is burning
and fearing all the time

1518
02:23:16.696 --> 02:23:21.785 line:82%
Crying every breath out loud for help
but there's no one around

1519
02:23:23.022 --> 02:23:28.276 line:82%
Looking in the gloomy face of bleak
and darkness everywhere

1520
02:23:29.318 --> 02:23:34.446 line:82%
Losing all hope and faith...
But, there's no one to dare

1521
02:23:34.902 --> 02:23:40.791 line:82%
Rises an Arrow to burn the evil,
and set the order right

1522
02:23:41.243 --> 02:23:47.754 line:82%
He strikes a blow, he fights alone
Shining so bright he's the knight
