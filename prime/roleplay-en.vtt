next to a beautiful woman
at a well-stocked bar,

Alice Overby,
are you here alone? May I ask?

219
00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.041 line:83%
It would appear to be, Bob.

220
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.083 line:83%
[laughs] Well, well. Traveling?

221
00:13:40.291 --> 00:13:42.041 line:83%
-It is a hotel, Bob.
-Fair enough.

222
00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.416 line:83%
People end up in hotels for all
kinds of reasons, don't they?

223
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:45.708 line:83%
That is true.

224
00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:47.916 line:83%
Forgive me.
I have to ask, are you a model?

225
00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:49.125 line:83%
Ha!

226
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:52.833 line:83%
Your expression says I overshot.
But I assure you, it's not a line.

227
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.125 line:83%
You're very beautiful.
And you do look familiar.

228
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:58.375 line:83%
Well, thank you,
but I'm actually in finance.

229
00:13:58.583 --> 00:13:59.458 line:83%
Ah!

230
00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.791 line:83%
That's why I've felt
such a profound connection to you.

231
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.416 line:83%

like I've known you for a long, long time.

Are you in finance too, Bob?

233
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:09.416 line:83%
Don't worry, I'm not going
to tear your ear off about work.

234
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:12.791 line:83%
I have a strict policy
of keeping my daytimes out of my nights

235
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.000 line:83%
and vice versa. [laughs]

236
00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:17.958 line:83%
But let me ask you

237
00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:19.583 line:83%
one question.

238
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.500 line:83%
OK Bob, one question.

239
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.416 line:83%
Do you love what you do?

240
00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:33.958 line:83%
Some days.

241
00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:35.125 line:83%
[Bob laughs]

242
00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.708 line:83%
Some days, she says.
She kills me, this one.

243
00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:43.666 line:83%
Alice Overby loves what she does
some days. I'll drink to that.

[intriguing music]

245
00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:51.375 line:83%
[Bob] All right well there it is,
mystery solved.

246
00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:53.666 line:83%
But you really do look familiar.

247
00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:57.416 line:83%
And I don't mean that
as some kind of line...

248
00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.291 line:83%
some kind of ploy.

249
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.375 line:83%
I just have that kind of face, I guess.

250
00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:06.250 line:83%
Some people do have that kind of face,
like an old girlfriend...

-I'll do an old fashioned.

253
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.083 line:83%
-Sure.
-Thanks.

254
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.916 line:83%
[Bob] There are some young women

255
00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:22.291 line:83%
that fall easily under the spell
of a much older man,

256
00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:24.958 line:83%
but I suspect you
may not be one of them.

257
00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.291 line:83%
Not the way you're making eyes
at this one down the bar.

258
00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:31.291 line:83%
Look, as a little junior broker
on his night out,

259
00:15:31.708 --> 00:15:33.541 line:83%
if I can be frank,
I think you can do better.

260
00:15:34.208 --> 00:15:35.666 line:83%
Maybe I'm not in the market, Bob.

261
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.166 line:83%
Ah, I see.

262
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:39.666 line:83%
Just unwinding at the end
of a long day of business travel,

263
00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:41.250 line:83%
wanting to be alone with your thoughts.

264
00:15:41.416 --> 00:15:43.208 line:83%
-Trying.
-[Bob] Well, Alice.

265
00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.791 line:83%
I'm going to give you that opportunity

266
00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.625 line:83%
because I must remove myself for a moment.

267
00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:50.500 line:83%
But, uh... Don't you go anywhere.

268
00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.625 line:83%
Oh, no promises, Bob.

269
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.291 line:83%
Have we met?

270
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:31.333 line:83%
I don't think so.

271
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.666 line:83%
Oh.

272
00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.291 line:83%
Well, I'm Jack.

Yes, please.

280
00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:59.166 line:83%
That is, unless your friend would mind.

281
00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:01.041 line:83%
Oh, he's not my friend. We just met.

282
00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.416 line:83%
What are you drinking, Alice?

283
00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:08.666 line:83%
-Vodka martini.
-[Dave] All right.

284
00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:12.916 line:83%
Excuse me. I'd like a vodka
martini for the lady

285
00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:15.791 line:83%
and I'll bill that to the room,
if that's all right.

286
00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.041 line:83%
Sure. I just need the name
and the room number.

287
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:19.708 line:83%
It's Jack...

288
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:22.333 line:83%
Dawson. And the room number is...

289
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.958 line:83%
Put that on mine, Chaz,
if that's all right with you, Jack.

290
00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:26.458 line:83%
-Oh, no, it's fine.
-[Bob] Please.

291
00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:29.375 line:83%
Just had some very nice news about work
and I'm in the mood to celebrate.

292
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:32.125 line:83%
Another scotch and soda for me.
Jack, another old fashioned?

293
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:34.125 line:83%
Uh, sure... Thanks.

294
00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:35.458 line:83%
Jack, Bob. Bob, Jack.

295
00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:38.208 line:83%
-Pleasure, Jack. Great suit.
-Oh, thank you.

296
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.583 line:83%
-Staying at the hotel?
-That's right.

297
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.916 line:83%
Um... In town for business.

298
00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:45.750 line:83%
Well, the lady and I have made
a very firm agreement not to talk shop,

299
00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:48.875 line:83%
so I'll ask what it is you do.
We'll leave it at that.

300
00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:52.625 line:83%
Yes, please do tell us.
Please tell us. Jack, What do you do?

301
00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:56.166 line:83%
I'm a photographer.

302
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:58.583 line:83%
[emphasizes] Wow! Art or commerce?

303
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.958 line:83%
Journalism, mainly.

304
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.625 line:83%
I used to photograph combat zones,

305
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.750 line:83%
but now it's mainly wildlife.

306
00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:08.166 line:83%
Exotic locales, that kind of thing.

307
00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:10.125 line:83%
Wow! Wonderful, don't you think?

308
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:11.375 line:83%
Yeah, wonderful.

309
00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:13.416 line:83%
I'm in finance myself, like the lady here.

310
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:18.208 line:83%
So for two sharks like us:
Wow, Jack, photography! [laughs]

311
00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:19.625 line:83%
Now,

312
00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:23.416 line:83%
maybe those drinks won't quite suffice.
How about...

313
00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:24.916 line:83%
a shot?

314
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:26.583 line:83%
[intriguing music]

315
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.500 line:83%
-Oh, I don't think...
-I don't remember the last time I did one.

316
00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:32.291 line:83%
Chaz, this rowdy crowd here
is fixing to add some shots.

317
00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:35.083 line:83%
Some of that nice mezcal
you showed me last night.

318
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.833 line:83%
In the business we're in,
good news is so rare.

319
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.541 line:83%
I appreciate the company
for a celebratory round.

320
00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:43.416 line:83%
Congrats Bob,
on whatever good news you've got.

321
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.750 line:83%
Well I don't mean to be coy, of course,

322
00:18:46.916 --> 00:18:51.083 line:83%
but as it happens, a rather large contract
has all but fallen in my lap.

323
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.041 line:83%
So naturally, I'm over the moon.

324
00:18:54.208 --> 00:18:57.750 line:83%
Sure, you'd be interested in the detail.

325
00:18:57.916 --> 00:19:00.375 line:83%
I didn't get the particulars
of which part of the financial sector

326
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:01.541 line:83%
you're in, did I Alice?

327
00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:03.375 line:83%
Mergers and acquisitions.

328
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:07.375 line:83%
Ah! So yes, I'm sure
we do have a lot in common after all.

329
00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:10.166 line:83%
-[Bob] You're not based in New York?
-No, just here for meetings.

330
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.541 line:83%
I thought we might have
some European colleagues in common.

331
00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:13.625 line:83%
[Emma] Domestic only.

332
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:15.666 line:83%
-Aren't we done talking business, Bob?
-Right.

333
00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:19.208 line:83%
Make a rule just to break it.
Naughty Bob! Ah, wonderful.

334
00:19:20.916 --> 00:19:22.166 line:83%
Salute.

335
00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:23.333 line:83%
-[Emma] Hm...
-[Dave] Hm...

336
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.000 line:83%
Yeah.

337
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.333 line:83%
[coughs]

338
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.833 line:83%
[Bob] Wow!

339
00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:32.875 line:83%
I should have warned you.
Bit of a kick.

340
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:34.791 line:83%
Oh, yeah.
That's why I don't take shots.

341
00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.125 line:83%
[laughs loudly]

342
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:39.375 line:83%
Excuse me, can I get a water please?
Thank you.

343
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:41.958 line:83%
This one is bright as a button, Jack.
You better believe it.

344
00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:43.166 line:83%
Oh, I believe it.

345
00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.500 line:83%
[Bob] The kind of woman
a lot of men are looking for.

346
00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:47.166 line:83%
A lot of men might kill for.

347
00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:50.000 line:83%
Aren't we lucky to keep her company
even for a fleeting moment?

348
00:19:50.166 --> 00:19:51.875 line:83%
In fact, I'll raise a glass to it.

349
00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:55.958 line:83%
To... It is Alice, isn't it?

350
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.958 line:83%
As long as I can remember, Bob.

351
00:19:58.125 --> 00:19:59.541 line:83%
To Alice Overby.

352
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:03.875 line:83%
And to all the less lucky victims
of her considerable charms.

353
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.416 line:83%
[huffs] Another.

354
00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:13.958 line:83%
We're good.

355
00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:15.375 line:83%
[Dave] Bob...

356
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:17.541 line:83%
-It's been a pleasure.
-Ah! [laughs]

357
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.250 line:83%
I see. It would appear
I am cramping the young man's style.

358
00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:23.041 line:83%
-Heaven forbid.
-I don't mean to be rude.

359
00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:24.208 line:83%
No, of course not.

360
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.291 line:83%
If I were 20 years younger,
I might take offence...

361
00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:27.375 line:83%
Bob!

362
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:30.291 line:83%
The hint is taken. So I will leave you.

363
00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:32.958 line:83%
And Jack... [trills lips]
best of luck.

364
00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:34.250 line:83%
And Alice, dear,

365
00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:36.750 line:83%
dear, Alice. [smacks lips]

366
00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:39.583 line:83%
511 is the sweet number.
If anyone's itching for a nightcap,

367
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.708 line:83%
once they blink the lights.

368
00:20:42.125 --> 00:20:43.500 line:83%
And on that note...

369
00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:45.166 line:83%
Pow.

370
00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:48.750 line:83%
[Emma giggles]

371
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.375 line:83%
I cannot believe we're finally alone.

372
00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:53.958 line:83%
It is hard to believe, isn't it? [giggles]

373
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.708 line:83%
So should we continue
getting to know each other, Jack?

374
00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:01.750 line:83%
I would like that, Alice.
I would like that a lot.

375
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:03.250 line:83%
More shots?

376
00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:04.541 line:83%
[elevator door rings]

377
00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:10.833 line:83%
[Dave] I'm actually here
scouting a location for a...

378
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000 line:83%
new solo show I have in the spring.

379
00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:17.041 line:83%
-Solo? Cool.
-Yeah, sure.

380
00:21:17.208 --> 00:21:20.083 line:83%
All the photographs I've taken in Beirut.

381
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.500 line:83%
And Turks and Caicos.

382
00:21:22.666 --> 00:21:24.875 line:83%
-Turks and Caicos?
-Both of them.

383
00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:27.958 line:83%
Is that your room, Mr. Dawson?

384
00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.708 line:83%
-Yeah, yeah.
-OK.

385
00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:31.750 line:83%
-[Dave]Here we are.
-[Emma] OK.

386
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.833 line:83%
-Here.
-Let's go, come on in.

387
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:38.708 line:83%
[Emma] Join me in the room.

388
00:21:40.583 --> 00:21:43.416 line:83%
Should I put on some music?

389
00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:45.333 line:83%
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah? OK.

390

[sighs]

392
00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:52.625 line:83%
[Dave] Oh, that's good.

393
00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:56.750 line:83%
Here you go.

394
00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:59.041 line:83%
Thank you. Cheers.

395
00:21:59.208 --> 00:22:00.791 line:83%
-Cheers.
-Drink up.

396
00:22:02.666 --> 00:22:04.000 line:83%
[Emma giggles]

397
00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:08.291 line:83%
OK.
So why don't you also remove your shoes

398
00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:11.416 line:83%
and meet me on the bed?
Get comfortable.

399
00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:13.083 line:83%
I'll be right back.

400
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:14.625 line:83%
[Dave] I'll do that.

401
00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:17.875 line:83%
I'll do that.

402
00:22:26.458 --> 00:22:29.166 line:83%
[curious music]

403
00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:21.625 line:83%
May I?

404
00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:27.750 line:83%
Smart girl.

405
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:34.083 line:83%
How long have you been Alice Overby?

406
00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:36.333 line:83%
Or was that just for tonight?

407
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.041 line:83%
Yeah. It's hard to keep track, Bob.

408
00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:39.541 line:83%
You know the drill.

409
00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:42.708 line:83%
-So who are you?
-[Bob] A kindred spirit.

410
00:24:42.875 --> 00:24:45.000 line:83%
That simp down there, he a target?

411
00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:46.958 line:83%
Being that we're kindred spirits,

412
00:24:47.125 --> 00:24:49.666 line:83%
you can understand why I don't want
to elaborate on that topic.

413
00:24:49.833 --> 00:24:50.708 line:83%
[Bob] Fair enough.

414
00:24:50.875 --> 00:24:52.416 line:83%
Me, I'm an open book.

415
00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:55.541 line:83%
You see that Panamanian diplomat they
pulled out the East River this morning?

416
00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:56.958 line:83%
I must have missed that one.

417
00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:58.791 line:83%
[Bob] More a headache
than it should have been.

418
00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:00.750 line:83%
Ruined my favorite shirt.
You can believe it.

419
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.375 line:83%
So imagine my delight,

420
00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:05.500 line:83%
when I see the woman across the bar

421
00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:07.416 line:83%
is a familiar face.

422
00:25:07.583 --> 00:25:08.541 line:83%
[waitress]
Miss.

423
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:10.583 line:83%
Compliments of the gentleman.

424
00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:15.250 line:83%
[Bob]
And the familiar face
has a very large bounty attached to it.

425
00:25:15.416 --> 00:25:17.333 line:83%
She kills me this one.

426
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.125 line:83%
[Bob]
But I had to be sure.

427
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:21.750 line:83%
Why, I stepped away
to take a more careful look

428
00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:24.125 line:83%
at your photograph on the tip sheet.

429
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:27.250 line:83%
Sure enough, there it is.
The one and only

430
00:25:27.416 --> 00:25:28.791 line:83%
Anna Peller.

431
00:25:28.958 --> 00:25:30.750 line:83%
[inhales deeply]

432
00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:32.291 line:83%
Oh, relax.

433
00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:34.750 line:83%
Relax!

434
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:36.625 line:83%
Sovereign doesn't want you dead,

435
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:40.291 line:83%
which, come to think of it,
does set the mind reeling.

436
00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:44.166 line:83%
A hired killer breaks with the world's
leading murder for hire syndicate

437
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:45.458 line:83%
and goes off grid.

438
00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:47.833 line:83%
But I'm not even supposed to kill her.
[snorts]

439
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.958 line:83%
Gwen Carver
must have a real soft spot for you.

440
00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:52.708 line:83%
Can we cut to the chase here, Bob?

441
00:25:52.875 --> 00:25:55.458 line:83%
Well, perhaps us two birds of a feather

442
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.166 line:83%
could come up with an arrangement.

443
00:25:57.333 --> 00:25:58.875 line:83%
Hm. And what does that look like?

444
00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:01.333 line:83%
Sixty percent commission
on any future work.

445
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.083 line:83%
And you and me,
we keep a line open just between us.

446
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.083 line:83%
Hm...

447
00:26:06.666 --> 00:26:09.916 line:83%
I could call our mutual friends
at Sovereign right now.

448
00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:12.541 line:83%
Send one text
and bring the whole world down

449
00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:13.875 line:83%
on your head.

450
00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:17.666 line:83%
And do quite right by my bank account.

451
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:21.875 line:83%
So you don't work for Sovereign?

452
00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:24.583 line:83%
I work for the highest bidder.
I always have.

453
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.500 line:83%
Twenty.

454
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:33.500 line:83%
Fifty.

455
00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:34.541 line:83%
Twenty-five.

456
00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:38.125 line:83%
[Bob] Do not underestimate me
or what I'm capable of.

457
00:26:38.291 --> 00:26:41.750 line:83%
Sovereign wants you alive, this is true.
But alive is a pretty broad term.

458
00:26:52.125 --> 00:26:53.958 line:83%
-Nothing for you, Bob?
-[Bob laughs]

459
00:26:54.125 --> 00:26:57.750 line:83%
A cyanide on the rocks?
I think I'll pass.

460
00:26:58.166 --> 00:26:59.666 line:83%
OK. Suit yourself.

461
00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:03.458 line:83%
There you go.

462
00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:04.791 line:83%
So what do you think?

463
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:07.458 line:83%
You think we're getting closer to a deal?

464
00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:09.000 line:83%
Forty.

465
00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:12.958 line:83%
See, I don't think I have 40 percent
to give you.

466
00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:14.666 line:83%
I already give 30 percent
to the guy

467
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.375 line:83%
who's supposed to keep guys
like you away from me. So...

468
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.083 line:83%
it's not in the budget.
You feel free to make that call.

469

How's that?

for the safety of your family.

839
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.916 line:83%

your feelings about your wife

841
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.041 line:83%

to say the least.

843
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:34.791 line:83%

Thanks.

Look, I fucked up in New York.
I get that, we make mistakes.

847

It happens to the best of us.
But why was there heat on me at first?

848
00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:45.416 line:83%
Actually, no.
It doesn't happen to the best of us.

I can't protect you if you're out there

He wasn't Sovereign.
He just had them on speed dial.

Why was there heat on me?

852

There's always heat. Don't you get it?
She's never gonna to let you go.

[Carver] Emma is a threat.

A dangerous one.

855
00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:02.625 line:83%
Maybe most dangerous to herself.

Dave,

857
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.041 line:83%
I understand your loyalty to your wife,

858
00:50:09.916 --> 00:50:11.583 line:83%
but it is crucial

859
00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:13.208 line:83%
right now

860
00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:16.791 line:83%

don't you need a warrant for that?

864

[Emma] Oh, you sure you don't want
to hand me in and take the reward?

[Raj] Very funny.

866
00:50:36.875 --> 00:50:39.416 line:83%
If I wanted to hand you over,
I could have done it a long time ago.

867
00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:41.000 line:83%
Oh yeah?

868
00:50:41.166 --> 00:50:43.166 line:83%
Do you have any idea what I do for you?

869

What you do for me?

870

Last I checked,

871

I do the dirty work, and you get paid.

872

I keep you underground.

873
00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:52.666 line:83%
Yeah well...

874
00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:55.416 line:83%
that's not exactly going as planned.

875
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.791 line:83%
Your wife, Emma, is a role
played by a criminal

876
00:50:59.958 --> 00:51:01.750 line:83%
named Anna Peller.

877
00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:04.041 line:83%
She played you.

878

You know that.

The last thing you should be doing
is trolling luxury hotels in Manhattan.

I forgot our fucking anniversary.

883
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:23.333 line:83%
She is incapable of love or compassion.

884
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:27.708 line:83%
She is a cold-blooded killer

885
00:51:28.958 --> 00:51:31.625 line:83%
who lied to you
and endangered your children.

886

[Raj] It's not just New York.

887
00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:35.708 line:83%
Your head isn't in the game
and I know that before.

888
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:38.333 line:83%
Yeah, well, I told you I need out.
Do you have them?

889
00:51:43.875 --> 00:51:45.625 line:83%
Kids too?

890
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.916 line:83%
Good. Good.

891
00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:51.375 line:83%
[Carver] Dave,

892
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.166 line:83%
I'm going to ask you one more time.

893
00:51:54.083 --> 00:51:56.333 line:83%
Might I take a look around?

894
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.041 line:83%
I've done what I can
to protect your little fantasy

895
00:52:01.208 --> 00:52:02.708 line:83%

Um...

897
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:07.875 line:83%
Time to say goodbye
to your perfect little family.

898
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:10.958 line:83%
I told you, I'm getting them out
and then I'm done with all this shit.

899
00:52:11.125 --> 00:52:14.625 line:83%
She is a cold-blooded murderer.

901

[Carver] Um... Mr. Brackett,

906
00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:57.541 line:83%
I'm very sorry. We're going
to have to continue this discussion

at a later date.

908

A life I never even thought I could have.

1100
01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:37.750 line:83%
I got pregnant, and there was Caroline.
It was like this perfect life.

1101
01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:39.166 line:83%
But you never stopped!

1102

It was only once or twice a year
at first, I swear.

1103
01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:43.791 line:83%
It was to fund our protection.

1104
01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:45.708 line:83%
The work trips.

1105
01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:47.875 line:83%
Nebraska?

-Then take a class!

I know, you're right.
I should do that, I know.

1112
01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:07.666 line:83%
I'm going to. Listen, it's done.
I don't want to do this anymore.

1113
01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:08.916 line:83%
Dave, look at me. I miss you.

1114
01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:10.916 line:83%
I miss doing the crossword puzzle
together.

1115
01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:13.875 line:83%
I miss sitting on the couch
watching Pixar movies with the kids,

1116
01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:15.666 line:83%
throwing candy in the popcorn.

1117
01:08:16.083 --> 01:08:17.416 line:83%
I miss having sex with you in our bed

1118
01:08:17.583 --> 01:08:19.166 line:83%
before we had to schedule it
on the calendar.

1119

OK...

1120
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.208 line:83%
-I love you.
-I know. I love you too.

1121
01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:35.916 line:83%
I love our family.

1122
01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:38.833 line:83%
But killing is bad.

1123
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.500 line:83%
Like, unacceptably bad.

1124

I know, I know. I'm done. Done.
I swear it's over.

1125
01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.333 line:83%
I just have to tie up
a few loose ends, and then I promise...

It's over.

You stay calm and do what they say.
I know what I'm doing.

if you guys don't mind, so...

1136
01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:24.708 line:83%
-Time to go.

1137

we'll... catch up with you later.

They've had a long trip.

He's not feeling his best.

No, I'm good right here.

because she was that rainbow.

1186
01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:51.833 line:83%
She wanted to make the unicorn
even prettier

1187
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.166 line:83%
because she wanted her to be a statue
for her castle.

1188
01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:58.083 line:83%
So I think that's because the queen is...

Really, Anna.
Your plan was a little crude.

1192

Of course, you knew
Dave was going to lead us

1193
01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:12.208 line:83%
right to you. Huh?

1194
01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.500 line:83%
For you to extract
whatever blunt sort of revenge

1195
01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:15.958 line:83%
you had in mind.

1196
01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.833 line:83%
And, of course,
we were going to take the kids.

1200
01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:30.500 line:83%
if the video games and the dog
don't keep them occupied,

1201
01:13:30.666 --> 01:13:32.333 line:83%
well, there's ping pong.

1202
01:13:33.166 --> 01:13:36.833 line:83%
Not that you're teaching them the benefit
of physical exercise.

I hear you.

1211

Is that what you need?

1212
01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:01.333 line:83%
You've acted out

1213
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:02.958 line:83%
all for what?

1214
01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.791 line:83%
So you could pick out dishwasher pods
at Target

1215
01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:08.541 line:83%
with Dave from New Jersey?

1216
01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.250 line:83%
Yeah, I like New Jersey

1217
01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:12.333 line:83%
and I love my family.

1218

All of you!

[Carver] Please, Anna. The language...

1224

[Emma] Fuck you.

1225
01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:32.583 line:83%
You took me.
You're not going to take my kids.

1226
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:35.375 line:83%
Oh, please. They were given to me.

Your sister in law was very concerned

1228
01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:40.875 line:83%
though I think is reassured
that the authorities had it all

1229

And I never took you, Anna.

01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:48.333 line:83%
[laughs] I took you in!

-I was a child.
-[Carver] Stop.

1234

Stop with the self-pity.

1235
01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:55.458 line:83%
You're better than that.

1236
01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:57.750 line:83%
At least you were.

1237
01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:09.291 line:83%
Don't. I don't wanna see... don't.

1238
01:15:13.625 --> 01:15:15.000 line:83%
Look at that girl.

1239
01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:16.916 line:83%
Look at her strength.

1240
01:15:17.666 --> 01:15:18.583 line:83%
Her power.

1241
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.958 line:83%
I gave those things to you.

1242
01:15:21.708 --> 01:15:23.583 line:83%
That makes you mine,

1243
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:25.958 line:83%
always.

1244
01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:30.166 line:83%

1245
01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.625 line:83%
You know what I want.

1246
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.125 line:83%
I want you back.

1247

We can all be a family.

Don't you see?

1249
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.166 line:83%
And it's the only way for

1250

your children to have a future,

1251
01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:45.916 line:83%
to have a life

1252
01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.958 line:83%
with you in it.

1253
01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:55.791 line:83%
You only need to get rid of Dave.

1254
01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:00.708 line:83%
Just one bullet.

1255
01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:03.708 line:83%
