00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.790 line:82%
-I hope no one touched the statue.
-No, sir!

2
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.440 line:82%
What happened?

3
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.170 line:82%
Sir, they created a fake as good as
the original

4
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.710 line:82%
and stole the original statue.

5
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.060 line:82%
Okay, file an FIR stating the statute
is safe, and only a murder ensued.

6
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.580 line:82%
And record it as a murder investigation.

7
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.420 line:82%
Sir, the original statue is missing.

8
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.280 line:82%
It's wrong!

9
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.530 line:82%
I have filed fifteen FIRs similar to this.

10
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.550 line:82%
What else do you expect?

11
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.590 line:82%
If we report it missing,
the people will protest to find the statue.

12
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.820 line:82%
It'll become a law and order problem.

13
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.240 line:82%
You won't understand the politics.
Do as I say.

14
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.350 line:82%
Okay, sir.

15
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.140 line:82%
Let's go!

16
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.640 line:82%
Varma, please open your eyesand see me.

17
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.570 line:82%
We haven't done anything wrong.

18
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.560 line:82%
I swear I will never betray you.

19
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.770 line:82%
Varma, please hear me out.

20
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.660 line:82%
One of us is a traitor.

21
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.950 line:82%
Why would you punish all three?

22
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.090 line:82%
Brother, please investigate and find out
the truth and then make a decision.

23
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.980 line:82%
I'm not a CB-CID to investigate
and find out the truth.

24
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.480 line:82%
It's best to kill everyone under suspicion.

25
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.040 line:82%
Please show us some mercy.

26
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.570 line:82%
You've worked with me for ten years
and you know how I operate...

27
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.280 line:82%
yet you expect mercy from me.

28
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.900 line:82%
Are you insulting me?

29
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.030 line:82%
Hey, Dhanraj!

30
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.900 line:82%
Show them mercy.

31
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.790 line:82%
Bloody, I don't get a network
in this dungeon.

32
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.470 line:82%
How does he expect me to
show them mercy?

33
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.080 line:82%
Here you go.

34
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.040 line:82%
-Hey!
-Hey, Dhanraj!

35
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.850 line:82%
-Spare my family, Varma.
-Oh, God, no!

36
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.990 line:82%
Why are you crying?

37
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.000 line:82%
Is that your family?
Show him his family.

38
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.630 line:82%
You punish me all you want.
But spare my family.

39
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.130 line:82%
This is my way of showing you mercy.

40
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.950 line:82%
[In Malayalam] What would
your family do without you?

41
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.870 line:82%
Likewise, what would you do
without your family?

42
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.200 line:82%
Varma, if you keep up this charade...

43
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.980 line:82%
In the end,
no one will be left to save you.

44
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.200 line:82%
Varma is enough to save himself.

45
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.880 line:82%
-Varma, please spare me.
-Who the hell are you?

46
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.860 line:82%
Please, Varma, please don't do it.

47
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.250 line:82%
Hey, Varma!

48
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.100 line:82%
Hey! Hey, Muruga!

49
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.820 line:82%
Hey, wake up! Did you die?

50
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.560 line:82%
Hurry up, get me water, damn it!

51
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.160 line:82%
Come on, hurry up! Wake up, damn it!

52
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.250 line:82%
Hey! He's dead, Varma!

53
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.550 line:82%
You're not like before you've become soft.

54
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.760 line:82%
You killed him with one blow.

55
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.920 line:82%
I was dreaming about torturing
and killing him.

56
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.800 line:82%
Look at me.

57
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.570 line:82%
Varma, Dhanraj claims to be loyal.

58
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.150 line:82%
What if he betrayed you?

59
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.110 line:82%
Is he accusing me?

60
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.520 line:82%
Come on, hit me!

61
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.110 line:82%
Kill me exactly like you killed him.

62
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.910 line:82%
Hey, he's rambling, and you're
taking him seriously.

63
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.300 line:82%
Why is he accusing me?
He should not!

64
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.150 line:82%
So, give me the hammer.

65
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.310 line:82%
How dare you challenge me
hanging upside down?

66
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.810 line:82%
Here I come!

67
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.280 line:82%
Show me your head, dear.

68
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.160 line:82%
What did you say about me and Varma?

69
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.150 line:82%
Instead of guarding the statue,
you're squealing.

70
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.670 line:82%
Die! Die!

71
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.620 line:82%
Die!

72
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.560 line:82%
What do you know about Varma?

73
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.200 line:82%
He's my friend for life.

74
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.080 line:82%
Say now!

75
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.900 line:82%
Talk. Why aren't you talking now?

76
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.390 line:82%
I can't find your mouth.

77
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.640 line:82%
The squealing mouth is missing.

78
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.310 line:82%
Varma, brother... brother... brother...

79
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.240 line:82%
-Varma!
-Everyone, listen closely.

80
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.450 line:82%
I don't know if Varma would die
for himself.

81
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.580 line:82%
But I will die for him.

82
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.330 line:82%
Watch me! Watch me!

83
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.610 line:82%
Poonai, take care of Varma.

84
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.480 line:82%
Hey, Varma!

85
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.920 line:82%
Listen carefully.

86
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.810 line:82%
The accounts are on the laptop.

87
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.480 line:82%
Laptop password: Varma is my friend.

88
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.410 line:82%
Varma, don't trust anyone.

89
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:46.980 line:82%
All of them are robbers!

90
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.260 line:82%
They will cheat you!

91
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.270 line:82%
I'm going to die,
and you guys aren't making way for me.

92
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.330 line:82%
Fools, step aside!

93
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.080 line:82%
-Hey, lift him.
-Going to hell! Wow!

94
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.560 line:82%
-Hey, drop them dead!
-Brother, please don't do it.

95
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.100 line:82%
Brother, please spare me.

96
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.600 line:82%
Ravi, please don't close it.

97
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.860 line:82%
-Okay.
-What's all this?

98
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.340 line:82%
Hang up. I'll call you back.

99
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.330 line:82%
Varma, the container has been seized.

100
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.190 line:82%
Call Seenu.

101
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.470 line:82%
He went in at 07:00 a.m.

102
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.080 line:82%
Now it's 10:00 a.m.

103
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.850 line:82%
How long will he ring the bell?

104
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.480 line:82%
And how will I complete my shoot?

105
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.790 line:82%
By the day,
his attitude is getting worse.

106
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.910 line:82%
Does he even realize how tough
is it to run a YouTube channel?

107
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.740 line:82%
Rithvik, I told you
I'd help with the shoot.

108
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.450 line:82%
I don't need your help.

109
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.020 line:82%
You carry on drying laundry.

110
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.880 line:82%
Why is she not enough for you?

111
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.500 line:82%
Guess, who is this?

112
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.450 line:82%
Who is it?

113
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.880 line:82%
-It's me.
-Oh...

114
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.240 line:82%
He's so good that I can't identify myself.

115
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.560 line:82%
If he does not step out,
I'll start crying.

116
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.960 line:82%
Followed by six hours of non-stop crying.

117
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.730 line:82%
-Everyone will get a headache.
-Hey, don't do it.

118
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.880 line:82%
-Hold on.
-You don't fear me anymore.

119
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.290 line:82%
-You don't respect me.
-Don't you dare start crying.

120
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.400 line:82%
Then it'll be a task to make you
stop crying.

121
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.120 line:82%
He does not seem to cease from prayers.

122
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.280 line:82%
Listen...

123
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.120 line:82%
I've told you often not to knock
on the door while praying.

124
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.160 line:82%
You promised him to shoot a video.

125
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.330 line:82%
As you did not come out,
he's creating a scene.

126
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.110 line:82%
Go and see for yourself.

127
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.000 line:82%
You people are taking turns to yell at me.

128
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.800 line:82%
One day I'll prove my worth.

129
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.670 line:82%
I wonder where he is.

130
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.070 line:82%
I don't know what he's going to say.

131
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.510 line:82%
Oh, you're here.
Come on. It's getting late.

132
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.520 line:82%
As it is, you're late.

133
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.310 line:82%
But you pretend well to be enthusiastic.

134
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.350 line:82%
On top of it, sass to butter me up.

135
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.990 line:82%
Sorry, sir, I was running late.

136
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.450 line:82%
Take out the camera.
What are we shooting today?

137
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.970 line:82%
-Gardening!
-Gardening?

138
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.910 line:82%
It's scorching hot today.

139
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.390 line:82%
Let's shoot a bathroom tour.
It's the latest trend.

140
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.680 line:82%
Bathroom tour?

141
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.840 line:82%
Yeah!

142
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.550 line:82%
Look how beautifully they're cleaning up.

143
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.930 line:82%
Scroll down to the comment section.

144
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.260 line:82%
Look at the disgusting comments.

145
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.780 line:82%
Action sir!

146
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.260 line:82%
Friends, look at the outcome
from two months of nurturing it.

147
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.590 line:82%
Cut, cut, cut.

148
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.390 line:82%
Sir, it looks like you bought it
from the store.

149
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.600 line:82%
It does not look real.

150
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.770 line:82%
This content is enough for 96 subscribers.

151
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.700 line:82%
Don't we need to be loyal
to our subscribers?

152
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.090 line:82%
The work should be real.

153
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.080 line:82%
How?

154
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.450 line:82%
Looks great. Now it looks real.

155
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.550 line:82%
Do you call this real?

156
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.720 line:82%
Thank goodness we did not do
the bathroom tour.

157
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.180 line:82%
Had we done it,
you would've stripped me naked.

158
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.790 line:82%
Sorry. Okay. Take.

159
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.720 line:82%
Excuse me!

160
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.470 line:82%
He's calling you.
Why don't you find out what he wants?

161
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.880 line:82%
Instead, you both have been whistling
and playing with each other.

162
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.670 line:82%
Okay, sir.

163
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.500 line:82%
Oh, God, did you cut yourself
while placing the knife?

164
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.230 line:82%
You could've been careful.

165
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.060 line:82%
Don't bother about it.
Look at this.

166
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.730 line:82%
Get inside the car.

167
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.150 line:82%
What is it, Muthu?

168
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.140 line:82%
He's a friend. We're just chatting.

169
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.730 line:82%
Friend? But he looks like a rogue.

170
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.480 line:82%
Ritu, you should respect elders.
Apologize to him.

171
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.600 line:82%
Sorry!

172
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.300 line:82%
To hell with your sorry.

173
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.220 line:82%
Are you coming,
or shall I take your grandson?

174
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.090 line:82%
-I will come.
-Let's go!

175
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.350 line:82%
Get me a cup of coffee.

176
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.980 line:82%
I'll go and get coffee.
Would you massage his head?

177
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.860 line:82%
Come to the front.

178
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.350 line:82%
I ought to!

179
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.790 line:82%
It's the Police. Speak with respect.

180
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.780 line:82%
Go and get us coffee.

181
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.880 line:82%
-He wants me to do everything.
-Sir, I'll pay your price.

182
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.640 line:82%
But please give me back the statue
you seized yesterday.

183
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.080 line:82%
It gets shipped from Tamilnadu

184
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.990 line:82%
to Trivandrum, Mumbai, Singapore,
and Los Angeles.

185
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.490 line:82%
I did not follow this case for five years
and discovered it

186
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.310 line:82%
just to hand it over as soon as you asked.

187
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.050 line:82%
But to arrest your entire network.

188
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.560 line:82%
You can see how deep this network runs.

189
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.710 line:82%
Why do you want to get into this mess?

190
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.010 line:82%
I'll spare you if you confess the truth.

191
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.600 line:82%
I'll whack you before your men and
drag you in your undies if you don't.

192
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.670 line:82%
He's threatening.

193
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.790 line:82%
Mani, let's say something
that'll scare the AC.

194
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.100 line:82%
Bring me the statue,
and you can take away your father.

195
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.220 line:82%
Father?

196
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.360 line:82%
Why did you kidnap him?

197
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.190 line:82%
I've seen people holding the tiger's tail
over the fear of a cat.

198
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.800 line:82%
But you directly held the dinosaur's tail!

199
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.600 line:82%
Have you seen a dinosaur
with a hacked limb?

200
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.430 line:82%
Wait a minute. I'll ask them
to bring his hacked hand.

201
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.170 line:82%
Muruga, hack that dinosaur's hand
and send me a picture.

202
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.230 line:82%
Muruga passed out.
It'll take an hour for him to wake up.

203
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.470 line:82%
-Okay, give it to Thaen.
-It'll take two hours for him.

204
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.170 line:82%
Who are you?

205
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.950 line:82%
It's me, the dinosaur speaking.

206
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.300 line:82%
Greetings, my son is not aware
of my traits.

207
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.580 line:82%
If he knows, it'll scare him.

208
00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.900 line:82%
Silently move to the next room and speak.

209
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.980 line:82%
Sir, it's between a thief and the Police.

210
00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.990 line:82%
Why are you troubling the family?

211
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.340 line:82%
Unnecessary!

212
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:30.070 line:82%
Now see, four innocent souls
took the brunt of it.

213
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.250 line:82%
Make sure to mention to my son
that I got scared.

214
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.030 line:82%
Okay, sir.

215
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.130 line:82%
♪ Would the hand that hurts love? ♪

216
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.070 line:82%
What is it?

217
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.070 line:82%
He would've claimed
that I'm not aware of his traits.

218
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.020 line:82%
Also, he would've said
I would be scared if I knew.

219
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.660 line:82%
Sir, one minute.

220
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.770 line:82%
The massager fell. Go and fetch it.

221
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.370 line:82%
As you kidnapped him,
he stopped at this point.

222
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.630 line:82%
If he knew you threatened me...

223
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.870 line:82%
He will cut you into 32 pieces
and scramble it.

224
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.460 line:82%
Only if we stack it as a puzzle
could one recognize you.

225
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.220 line:82%
Your best option is to let him go
and deal with me.

226
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.960 line:82%
Without causing trouble,
give up your boss's name.

227
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.480 line:82%
Sir, you think it's easy.

228
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.520 line:82%
Do you think so?

229
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.800 line:82%
Fine, I'll ask you the hard way.

230
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.350 line:82%
-Sir!
-Sir!

231
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.540 line:82%
-Kanaga Lakshmi, how are you?
-I'm fine at the moment.

232
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.560 line:82%
What happened?

233
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.810 line:82%
Your son is attracting serious trouble.

234
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.920 line:82%
I'm scared the trouble will
land on us too.

235
00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.670 line:82%
He is not afraid of anything.

236
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.760 line:82%
In the course of catching a rodent,
he will wake up the devil.

237
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.150 line:82%
It's best to adjust to the situation.

238
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.660 line:82%
Don't tell him that I told you.

239
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.900 line:82%
I can understand if you complain
that my son is dishonest.

240
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.170 line:82%
I don't know what to do if his honesty
comes as a complaint.

241
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.520 line:82%
I can understand your plight.

242
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.120 line:82%
You carry on. I'll speak to him.

243
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.300 line:82%
-Thank you, sir.
-Sir, see you.

244
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:25.900 line:82%
-Sir!
-Sir!

245
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.340 line:82%
Is everything okay?
Is there a problem?

246
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400 line:82%
Everything is well.

247
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000 line:82%
They served biryani. I ate well.

248
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.400 line:82%
Forget about it.

249
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.100 line:82%
You're handling a high-profile case.

250
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.570 line:82%
It'll be best if you don't dig deeper
and let it go.

251
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.000 line:82%
Because you have a family to look after.

252
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.370 line:82%
It's best not to poke the bear.

many times.

254

255
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.470 line:82%
You did not.

Muthu, why does your locket look different?

321
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.510 line:82%
When your father was young
he lost a tooth.

322
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.100 line:82%
He gave me that tooth and said...

323
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.670 line:82%
"If the tooth does not grow back,
I'll place this tooth back."

324
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.910 line:82%
Until then, he wanted me to
safe-keep the tooth.

325
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.880 line:82%
I have locked the tooth
in this locket since then.

326
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.410 line:82%
Keep going.

327
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.540 line:82%
Muthu, you're applying brakes,
thinking it's the accelerator.

328
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.640 line:82%
Am I?

329
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.220 line:82%
Now watch me.

330
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.440 line:82%
God help me!

331
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.700 line:82%
Phew! I got five more views
for my video today.

332
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.890 line:82%
Oh, is it? That means you can have
two more idlis.

333
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.010 line:82%
Hello, I could not get beetroot but carrot.

334
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.320 line:82%
Shall we make a video of carrot halwa?

335
00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.280 line:82%
I don't know how to make carrot halwa.

336
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.910 line:82%
It's best you get beetroot.

337
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.310 line:82%
The only difference is the color.

338
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.870 line:82%
Both are the same, sir.

339
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.670 line:82%
Don't talk too much,
and get home soon.

340
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.910 line:82%
It's not like I can fly.
I'll be there soon.

341
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.160 line:82%
Okay bye!

342
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.490 line:82%
Hey!

343
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.270 line:82%
Today it makes the 120th time
I almost rammed into you.

344
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.730 line:82%
But I never rammed into you.

345
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.490 line:82%
Still, you are afraid.

346
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.940 line:82%
What if you ram into me 121st time?

347
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.010 line:82%
Instead of getting hurt and admitting
to the hospital...

348
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.060 line:82%
I shall pick up the vegetables
and go home.

349
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.400 line:82%
You keep running your mouth.

350
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.120 line:82%
One day I'll bump you off the road
and pay 5000 rupees fine.

351
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.570 line:82%
Why do you torture me because
my grandson asked you not to park

352
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.890 line:82%
in front of the house?

353
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.320 line:82%
You were the one who provoked him.

354
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.080 line:82%
That's why he speaks too much.

355
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.840 line:82%
Do you know what your grandson said
when I parked the vehicle?

356
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.820 line:82%
"Don't park in front of my house."

357
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.580 line:82%
"Get a house of your own
if you want to park."

358
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.690 line:82%
Mr.Specs!

359
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.390 line:82%
Why would I drive a taxi
if I could afford to buy a house?

360
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.470 line:82%
I apologized a hundred times
for his behavior.

361
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.640 line:82%
Apologizing does not work for me.

362
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.180 line:82%
Only punishment.

363
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.490 line:82%
Hand me the fruits.

364
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.830 line:82%
Drumsticks for you!

365
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.710 line:82%
What did Bharathiyar quote?

366
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.800 line:82%
"Play well, dear..."

367
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.090 line:82%
"and don't forget to pick up
what's on the ground."

368
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.770 line:82%
Now that you picked it up.
You may leave.

369
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:22.540 line:82%
Shall I reverse and bump him?

370
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.960 line:82%
Perhaps next time!

371
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.430 line:82%
The number you're callingis either unreachable

372
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.850 line:82%
or switched off at the moment.

373
00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.090 line:82%
-Sir!
-Give the phone to the AC.

374
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.870 line:82%
Sir, AC, sir left last night.

375
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.370 line:82%
-Is it?
-Yes, sir.

376
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.810 line:82%
He mentioned he had to tend
to something and took a cab.

377
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.100 line:82%
Okay.

378
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.690 line:82%
Since last night Arjun did not return home.

379
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.930 line:82%
Not able to reach him over the phone.

380
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.640 line:82%
Call the station and check on him.

381
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.160 line:82%
-Sir!
-Do you know where's AC?

382
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.040 line:82%
I'm not able to reach himover the phone.

383
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.410 line:82%
AC, sir, did not inform me.

384
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.610 line:82%
If he calls, please inform him I called.

385
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.960 line:82%
-Sure, I will tell him.
-Okay.

386
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.420 line:82%
The number you're callingis either unreachable

387
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.970 line:82%
or switched off at the moment.

388
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.410 line:82%
Please try again...

389
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.940 line:82%
This is one of the rare instances.

390
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.110 line:82%
If the Assistant Commissioner itself
goes missing...

391
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.290 line:82%
I don't know what to say.

392
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.980 line:82%
Sir, the last spot, his signal pinged
was near Parrys Bridge.

393
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.850 line:82%
His colleagues have mentioned
that he was stressed off late.

394
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.910 line:82%
Maybe it is suicide.

395
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.780 line:82%
Any pressure from the family?

396
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.790 line:82%
Nothing of that sort.

397
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.930 line:82%
But I'm surprised to hear you all
speak this way.

398
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.430 line:82%
Okay, sir. We'll do our best.

399
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.100 line:82%
But a small request.

400
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.700 line:82%
For a few days, keep this to yourself.

401
00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.690 line:82%
Because it will be an embarrassment
to the department.

402
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.260 line:82%
I hope you understand.

403
00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.670 line:82%
Everyone knows what happened to Arjun.

404
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.920 line:82%
Still, you all pretend
and keep looking for him.

405
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.940 line:82%
If you attempt to find anything.

406
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.900 line:82%
People will come looking for us.

407
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.230 line:82%
It's safe if we ignore it.

408
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.430 line:82%
Oh, God,
the Assistant Commissioner is missing!

409
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.270 line:82%
I swear, had I been in good shape...

410
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.990 line:82%
I would've come along
and looked for him.

411
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.240 line:82%
I heard you both were having issues.

412
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.910 line:82%
Let me know. I can get it resolved.

413
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.480 line:82%
If you got him, please let him go.

414
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.510 line:82%
Or if you know anything, please tell me.

415
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.250 line:82%
Sir, I did warn the AC.

416
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.910 line:82%
Not to look for things
that did not concern him.

417
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.590 line:82%
If not, we will have to look for you.

418
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.170 line:82%
But he never listened!

419
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.240 line:82%
Boys, did you do anything to him?

420
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.770 line:82%
The day before,
none of you came to work.

421
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.870 line:82%
Where were you all?

422
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.520 line:82%
Brother, I went to the movies with Malliga.

423
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.090 line:82%
He's lying. He must've done it.

424
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.640 line:82%
Because Malliga was with me.

425
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.480 line:82%
-What the hell?
-Get lost!

426
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.490 line:82%
Don't worry, sir. We'll find out.

427
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.580 line:82%
We will find out who among the two
was with Malliga.

428
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.050 line:82%
Because next week I have a meeting
with Malliga.

429
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.930 line:82%
I'll meet her and update you.

430
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.320 line:82%
Mani, see what happened.

431
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.200 line:82%
The senior dinosaur came looking
for junior dinosaur.

432
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.000 line:82%
Yeah!

433
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.810 line:82%
Will he find him?

434
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.190 line:82%
They would've made a soup out of him.

435
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.020 line:82%
How long have you been married?

436
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.680 line:82%
It's been eight years.

437
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:17.560 line:82%
Kids?

438
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.940 line:82%
We have a six-year-old son.

439
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.450 line:82%
Recently did you and AC, sir
get into a fight?

440
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.070 line:82%
-No.
-Madam?

441
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.610 line:82%
Have you ever witnessed any
misunderstanding between them?

442
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.690 line:82%
Does he discuss official matters at home?

443
00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.880 line:82%
Any idea if he was in some trouble?

444
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.560 line:82%
Okay, thank you.

445
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.260 line:82%
-Sir.
-Sir!

446
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.060 line:82%
Sir, look at them misdirecting it
as a suicide case.

447
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.830 line:82%
He's not a person who would commit suicide.

448
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.440 line:82%
He was a crisp and honest officer.

449
00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.080 line:82%
Fearless!

450
00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.790 line:82%
I did warn the AC not to dig in deep.

451
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.080 line:82%
As our department may have a link to them.

452
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.470 line:82%
You're well aware of the department.

453
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.410 line:82%
They'll keep silent
despite knowing the truth.

454
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.560 line:82%
I'm speaking out of experience.

455
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.550 line:82%
History is we never recovered
even the corpse of officers

456
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.120 line:82%
who went looking for the statues.

457
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.800 line:82%
It's hurting to say this.

458
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.300 line:82%
AC is dead, sir.

459
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.180 line:82%
What happened, Mom?

460
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.380 line:82%
Had you let him live his life
on his terms...

461
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.590 line:82%
he would've been alive today.

462
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.010 line:82%
You raised him to be an honest officer...

463
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.220 line:82%
and now my son is dead!

464
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.660 line:82%
His death...

465
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:23.500 line:82%
Do you feel, in a way,
you're responsible for it?

466
00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.110 line:82%
Wow!

467
00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.040 line:82%
I usually see you shiver.

468
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:34.540 line:82%
But now you're standing like a rock.

469
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.070 line:82%
Had I run over,
you would've gone flying in the air.

470
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:41.880 line:82%
I'm in a different mood now.

471
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.910 line:82%
You should step aside.

472
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.110 line:82%
I'm the master of the moods.

473
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.100 line:82%
Don't test me!

474
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.910 line:82%
Where are you going?

475
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.900 line:82%
I'm going to meet Malliga.

476

After that, I decided not to spare you.

579

So, I killed him and pinned it on you.

580
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.550 line:82%
Why would you pin it on me?

581
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.640 line:82%

Even if you go without your hands,
they'll arrest you.

586
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.610 line:82%
Because you asked me to kill him.

587
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:27.690 line:82%
When did I ask you?

588
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.600 line:82%

What makes you say that he's afraid?

741
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.390 line:82%

You two, please step outside and wait.

747
00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.360 line:82%

-You have a family in the city.
-Yes.

763
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:29.870 line:82%
Also, you have a family on the outskirts

764
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:30.730 line:82%
Oh-oh...

765
00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.400 line:82%
As I got all your facts right...

766
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.380 line:82%
Do you still think I'm a patient?

767
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.020 line:82%
No!

768
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.490 line:82%
It's because I'm not a patient.

769
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.340 line:82%
Then why the hell are you here?

770
00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.340 line:82%
Doctor, I committed a murder.

771
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.270 line:82%
What did you say?

772
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.330 line:82%
Following that,
I committed two more murders.

773
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.460 line:82%
God help me!

774
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:54.180 line:82%
If my family knows, it'll scare them.

775
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.760 line:82%
If you keep piling on questions...

776
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:00.760 line:82%
I'm afraid they'll come to know.

777
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.430 line:82%
So, right now, you tell me...

778
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.700 line:82%
if I should commit the fourth murder
or not.

779
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.810 line:82%
Hey, please don't jump the gun.

780
00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.930 line:82%

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.810 line:82%
Hereafter, my family will stayat your hospital.

784
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:24.990 line:82%
I have work to tend to.

785
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:27.910 line:82%
Once I finish my work,
I'll return and take my family.

786
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:32.180 line:82%
Until I return, maintain
that I'm a patient to my family.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.840 line:82%
His mental illness is very dangerous.

788

It's a peculiar disease.

789
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.540 line:82%
People with this illness will behave
like a kitten.

790
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.970 line:82%
We can only feed milk to it.

791
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:49.600 line:82%
Suddenly they'll turn into a tiger!

792
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:52.170 line:82%
If you feed milk during that transition...

793
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.640 line:82%
he will grab your hand, bite and eat it.

794
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.430 line:82%
Suddenly he will turn into a snake.

795
00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.470 line:82%
During that time, you need to--

796
00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.170 line:82%
Doctor, how do we know

Take a look at the car and let me know
where they went.

I work for you without the knowledge
of the department.

You don't have to remind me.

I'll take my leave.

813
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.580 line:82%
I'll end up in hell,
consistently lying to my wife.

814
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.190 line:82%

Oh, no!

821
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:20.950 line:82%
I kept walking and came too far.

829
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:46.210 line:82%
He's mentally ill at the moment.

830
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.520 line:82%
I think he walked too far.

831
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.530 line:82%
It'll be helpful if you could tell me
where he is now.

832
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:55.360 line:82%
In fact, he lost his way
and arrived in Bangalore.

833
00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:56.820 line:82%
-Where did you say?
-Yes!

Don't worry.
I suggested he go on a long walk.

846
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.430 line:82%
I think he strolled on
the Bangalore highway.

847
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.290 line:82%
Thus he arrived in Bangalore.

848

You won't be here in the morning to listen.

1117
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.110 line:82%
What is it? Are you afraid?

1122
01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.040 line:82%
I want you both to sit tight

-How does it matter now?
-Why didn't you do it?

1132
01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:46.490 line:82%
How could she kill a person?

1133
01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.330 line:82%
As you're not capable of it...

1134
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:51.960 line:82%
you did not do it.

1135
01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.240 line:82%
I was capable of doing it.

And I did it.

1137
01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:00.710 line:82%
What are you rambling about?

1138
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:08.590 line:82%
Hey!

Sit down!

1141
01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:23.530 line:82%
I heard a vehicle outside.

1142
01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:26.780 line:82%
I know.

1143
01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:34.790 line:82%
People are here to kill us.

1144
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:38.020 line:82%
I don't understand.

1145

What you said earlier was correct, Viji.

1146
01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.640 line:82%
I raised him to be an honest person,
so he got killed.

1147
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.630 line:82%
I'm one of the reasons for Arjun's death.

when I think about it.

1149

He's my son!

1150
01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.630 line:82%
That is why I killed the man
who killed Arjun.

1151
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:13.240 line:82%
Following it,
I killed two to three more people.

1152
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.080 line:82%
Now you're scaring me!

1153
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:39.470 line:82%
What if they harm our family?

1154
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.690 line:82%
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to our family.

stop everything after this point?

1170
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:58.020 line:82%
I went too far.

1171
01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.690 line:82%
I can only return
when I'm done with everything.

1172

"How are you, Balu?" story.

1745
01:53:19.390 --> 01:53:22.270 line:82%
Bloody senseless moron...

1746
01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:24.720 line:82%
Do you think working as a spy is
as easy as murdering someone?

1747
01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:25.930 line:82%
If you continue being a jerk...

1748
01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:28.570 line:82%
I will go to Blast Mohan's house
and end me.

1749
01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.960 line:82%
Everything will be messed up!

1750
01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:31.590 line:82%
Mind your tongue.

1751
01:53:32.850 --> 01:53:34.380 line:82%
You've been frying my brain.

1752
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:44.260 line:82%
Hey, why are you yelling at him?

1753
01:53:45.170 --> 01:53:47.550 line:82%
You'd realize when you sit on
someone's lap.

1754
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:55.420 line:82%
I'm okay with the story you narrated.

1755
01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:57.690 line:82%
But the film should be a sure-shot hit.

1756
01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:59.010 line:82%
It will definitely be a hit!

1757
01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:00.390 line:82%
I stand guarantee!

1758
01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:04.230 line:82%
As I narrated in real life,
the crown is at Adhi Narayana Temple.

1759
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:06.320 line:82%
If I do a recce with my team...

1760
01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.760 line:82%
I can shoot it naturally.

1761
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:09.300 line:82%
And a National Award is confirmed.

1762
01:54:09.730 --> 01:54:10.760 line:82%
-Ramprasad.
-Babu.

1763
01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.660 line:82%
Who do we approach
to see the crown in person?

1764
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:13.850 line:82%
It's enough that you approach yourself.

1765
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:15.190 line:82%
You're one of the trustees of the temple.

1766
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:16.450 line:82%
Make arrangements.

1767
01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:19.660 line:82%
Okay, where's madam in this story?

1768
01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:20.990 line:82%
How can she not be in it?

1769
01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:23.530 line:82%
Only if madam is in it,
the director will work.

1770
01:54:25.710 --> 01:54:28.760 line:82%
He meant to say you will act
only if madam is in the film.

1771
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:30.560 line:82%
He said it wrong...

1772
01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:32.680 line:82%
He's telling it wrong.

1773
01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:35.780 line:82%
-How does he know?
-He's always with us.

1774
01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:37.100 line:82%
He noticed.

1775
01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.550 line:82%
Did you notice?

1776
01:54:54.810 --> 01:54:56.050 line:82%
-[In Telugu] How are you?
-I'm good.

1777
01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:57.820 line:82%
I'm coming from
Treasurer Blast Mohan's office.

1778
01:54:57.850 --> 01:54:58.630 line:82%
I know who you are.

1779
01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:00.140 line:82%
That's the director and his assistant.

1780
01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:33.050 line:82%
-Srini take down measurements.
-Okay, sir.

1781
01:55:33.070 --> 01:55:35.570 line:82%
You will have to recreate a set
as original as this one.

1782
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:37.760 line:82%
Worth! Worth! Worth!

1783
01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.210 line:82%
All our hard work is paid off, Varma.

1784
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:40.890 line:82%
-Worth!
-Did you see it?

1785
01:55:41.070 --> 01:55:42.810 line:82%
It was out of the world.

1786
01:55:42.970 --> 01:55:44.000 line:82%
Mind-blowing!

1787
01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:45.760 line:82%
Truly mind-blowing!

1788
01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:46.640 line:82%
Give the phone to Paneer.

1789
01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:49.500 line:82%
Oh, open your mouth, baby.

1790
01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.190 line:82%
Varma, I saw the crown.

1791
01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.940 line:82%
For forty years, I only heard about it.

1792
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.490 line:82%
Today I was four feet away from it.

1793
01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.360 line:82%
Since I saw it, my body is wobbling.

1794
01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:02.310 line:82%
You start working on safekeeping
the crown once we steal it.

1795
01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:03.860 line:82%
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

1796
01:56:14.530 --> 01:56:17.240 line:82%
God, everything should go well.

1797
01:56:40.630 --> 01:56:43.590 line:82%
[In Malayalam] If someone tries to
seize my container...

1798
01:56:44.210 --> 01:56:47.440 line:82%
I'm eager to know who did it.

1799
01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:55.060 line:82%
[In Tamil] I've been asking you
for ten minutes.

1800
01:57:02.070 --> 01:57:04.490 line:82%
I can't ask you sweet enough.

1801
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:08.690 line:82%
Tell me, who planned to nab my container?

1802
01:57:09.230 --> 01:57:12.050 line:82%
[In Malayalam] If I confess
they will kill me, sir.

1803
01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:14.960 line:82%
If you don't confess...

1804
01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:17.960 line:82%
do you think I'll take you for dinner?

1805
01:57:18.230 --> 01:57:19.110 line:82%
Silly boy!

1806
01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.060 line:82%
[In Hindi] Damn you, boy...

1807
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.100 line:82%
I know that you won't confess either.

1808
01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:50.570 line:82%
[In Hindi] Sir... Sir...
It was Kareem's plan.

1809
01:57:50.710 --> 01:57:52.100 line:82%
He asked us to do it.

1810
01:57:52.150 --> 01:57:52.730 line:82%
Kareem?

1811
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.990 line:82%
Bloody, don't lie to me!

1812
01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.730 line:82%
[In Tamil] I swear, it was Kareem's plan.

1813
01:58:02.890 --> 01:58:04.130 line:82%
It was Kareem's plan.

1814
01:58:04.450 --> 01:58:05.210 line:82%
I'm surprised.

1815
01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:10.620 line:82%
Even after he's dead,
you claim it's Kareem.

1816
01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.970 line:82%
That confirms it's Kareem's plan.

1817
01:58:16.610 --> 01:58:19.100 line:82%
Sir, your friend is here to meet you.

1818
01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:26.390 line:82%
Wash your face clean
and eat before you leave.

1819
01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:05.870 line:82%
-Sir!
-Mathew!

1820
01:59:06.090 --> 01:59:07.890 line:82%
It's been a long time since I met you.

1821
01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:09.880 line:82%
I told you I'll come and meet you.

1822
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:11.060 line:82%
Why did you come so far?

1823
01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:12.670 line:82%
I need a favor.
I should come to you.

1824
01:59:12.890 --> 01:59:14.180 line:82%
-Please sit down.
-Sit down.

1825
01:59:17.010 --> 01:59:18.680 line:82%
I collected all the details you require.

1826
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:20.810 line:82%
As you mentioned...

1827
01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:23.340 line:82%
it's quite a difficult job
to steal the crown.

1828
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.120 line:82%
Because the Government is
closely watching the crown.

1829
01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:29.330 line:82%
Suppose you go in and get caught...

1830
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:31.300 line:82%
you will never see the light of the day.

1831
01:59:32.250 --> 01:59:35.040 line:82%
Instead, the guy who asked you
to steal the crown...

1832
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:36.970 line:82%
killing him would be easy.

1833
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:38.140 line:82%
Take a look.

1834
01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:46.440 line:82%
If you say the word...

1835
01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:49.590 line:82%
they'll shoot him
from three different directions

1836
01:59:50.670 --> 01:59:52.960 line:82%
No! No, no. No, Mathew.

1837
01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:57.460 line:82%
I already mentioned it to you.
My son is with him.

1838
01:59:57.710 --> 02:00:00.290 line:82%
This would put my son's life in danger.

1839
02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:01.790 line:82%
Things will go wrong.

1840
02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:04.100 line:82%
I don't care for the risk.

1841
02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:06.150 line:82%
I will steal the crown myself.

1842
02:00:07.050 --> 02:00:08.270 line:82%
I totally understand.

1843
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:11.270 line:82%
How about killing them?

1844
02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:24.920 line:82%
They have entrusted me.

1845
02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:26.660 line:82%
If you say so.

1846
02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:29.260 line:82%
Excuse me.

1847
02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:33.230 line:82%
-Can I use the western bathroom?
-Yes!

1848
02:00:33.810 --> 02:00:34.390 line:82%
Thank you.

1849
02:00:37.850 --> 02:00:40.420 line:82%
As a precaution,
I will keep him under my radar.

1850
02:00:40.730 --> 02:00:41.900 line:82%
It may be useful later.

1851
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:44.370 line:82%
Anyway, I have everything ready
you asked for.

1852
02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:46.010 line:82%
Let's go and check it out.

1853
02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:01.540 line:82%
Thanks, Mathew!

1854
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:03.370 line:82%
Anytime for you, sir.

1855
02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.160 line:82%
I have never seen such a location
in Andhra.

1856
02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:10.750 line:82%
Why did you put up the location
over here?

1857
02:01:10.810 --> 02:01:11.890 line:82%
I don't want anything getting leaked.

1858
02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.650 line:82%
It's a reference to a Hollywood film.

1859
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:14.960 line:82%
If you see, you'll understand.

1860
02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.570 line:82%
What's so awesome about it?

1861
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:19.460 line:82%
The light strikes in multiple directions...

1862
02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:21.800 line:82%
but he dodges it
and smoothly goes around.

1863
02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:23.150 line:82%
That's awesome!

1864
02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:27.560 line:82%
No matter how he moves, they're
pointing the light without touching him.

1865
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:28.810 line:82%
Now that's awesome!

1866
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:30.360 line:82%

All of you stay down!

1992
02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:34.990 line:82%

Relax!

2008

Acting is a tough job.

2009
02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:43.690 line:82%
Timing should be in sync with
shots fired, and blood splatter.

2010
02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:45.360 line:82%
Also, have to pretend to die.

2011
02:14:45.650 --> 02:14:46.550 line:82%
This is too much work, sir.

2012
02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:48.540 line:82%
Instead of pretending to steal...

2013
02:14:48.610 --> 02:14:50.200 line:82%
we could've stolen the original crown.

2014
02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:51.520 line:82%
That would've been easier.

2015
02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:54.350 line:82%
I'm not a thief to steal.

2016
02:14:58.530 --> 02:14:59.260 line:82%

2017
02:15:01.490 --> 02:15:02.460 line:82%
You're right about it!

2018
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:06.130 line:82%
-Is everything okay, sir?
-All well!

2019
02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:07.550 line:82%
Good job, Jafar.

2020
02:15:08.010 --> 02:15:09.550 line:82%

2022
02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:14.370 line:82%
-Boys!
-Yes, sir.

2023
02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:20.290 line:82%
We're calling from CBI.

2024
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:21.480 line:82%
Sorry for troubling you, sir.

2025
02:15:22.130 --> 02:15:25.220 line:82%
After examination, it's confirmedthat the crown is original.

2026
02:15:25.690 --> 02:15:28.120 line:82%
Also, it's proved thatfootage is shooting footage.

2027
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:29.030 line:82%
Sorry, sir.

2028
02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:34.440 line:82%
I asked you to be the mediator
for my love.

2029
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:36.870 line:82%
But you turned me into the mediator
for your love.

2030
02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:38.810 line:82%
Traitor!

2031
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.850 line:82%
Remove it!

2032
02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:40.910 line:82%
Remove the wig!

2033
02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:43.340 line:82%
I said remove the bloody wig!

2034
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:45.790 line:82%
How dare you don
Pawan Kalyan's hairstyle?

2035
02:15:46.070 --> 02:15:47.410 line:82%
Wig head!

2036
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:49.390 line:82%
Die!

2037
02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:54.200 line:82%
Go ahead!

2038
02:15:58.750 --> 02:15:59.980 line:82%
Blind love...

2039
02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:03.100 line:82%
I've gifted you many things.

2040
02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:05.660 line:82%
Now I'm giving you away as a gift.

2041
02:16:06.250 --> 02:16:06.760 line:82%
Go!

2042
02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:13.600 line:82%
Dhivya!

2043
02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:22.140 line:82%
Hey, everyone, scram.
We have special work.

2044
02:16:22.270 --> 02:16:23.450 line:82%
Keep walking, don't stop.

2045
02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:25.460 line:82%
Hurry up! Keep walking.

2046
02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:28.560 line:82%
Hey, place the table in the middle
and leave.

2047
02:17:18.710 --> 02:17:20.050 line:82%
Hello, Jailer's son!

2048
02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:21.590 line:82%
The Jailer is very powerful.

2049
02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:24.600 line:82%
I have to say your father is mighty.

2050
02:17:25.610 --> 02:17:26.960 line:82%
I told you this in the beginning.

2051
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:29.940 line:82%
If my father set his heart on it,
he would do anything.

2052
02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:34.060 line:82%
Had you agreed to the 50% I demanded...

2053
02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:35.590 line:82%
we could've become partners

2054
02:17:35.970 --> 02:17:37.580 line:82%
and carried out many operations like it.

2055
02:17:41.810 --> 02:17:42.570 line:82%
It looks great.

2056
02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:45.800 line:82%
I did not seek you out
for four and a half years...

2057
02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:49.250 line:82%
to arrest you and get a medal.

2058
02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:51.590 line:82%
But to join hands in the business.

2059
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:57.930 line:82%
Instead, you kidnapped
and locked me in here...

2060
02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:59.770 line:82%
and tortured me for six months.

2061
02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.350 line:82%
It neither benefited you nor me.

2062
02:18:03.210 --> 02:18:06.090 line:82%
Don't get too excited
that you got the crown.

2063
02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:10.200 line:82%
Because without my help,
you can't take this anywhere.

2064
02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:13.560 line:82%
Why would I need your help anymore?

2065
02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:16.070 line:82%
If my father came forward
and gave you something,

2066
02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:20.100 line:82%
he must surely have a back up plan
to take it back from you.

2067
02:18:21.470 --> 02:18:23.710 line:82%
My father would've encountered
many criminals like you.

2068
02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:29.430 line:82%
But his only weakness is me.

2069
02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:31.660 line:82%
The trust he has in me.

2070
02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:36.090 line:82%
If I use the trust and divert him...

2071
02:18:38.310 --> 02:18:39.400 line:82%
the perks of this crown...

2072
02:18:40.740 --> 02:18:41.550 line:82%
can be shared by all.

2073
02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:43.390 line:82%
If not...

2074
02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:46.960 line:82%
he will bury you all with the crown.

2075
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:51.670 line:82%
You have no other option
but making me your 50% partner.

2076
02:18:52.410 --> 02:18:54.120 line:82%
What do you say, 50-50?

2077
02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:55.460 line:82%
Right?

2078
02:18:55.930 --> 02:18:57.870 line:82%
Varma, he's right.

2079
02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:00.910 line:82%
You don't know about his father.
We've observed him in person.

2080
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:03.680 line:82%
As he says, split the bounty
in equal halves...

2081
02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:05.870 line:82%
and working together is a great idea.

2082
02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:11.660 line:82%
First, I'll go and patiently speak
to my father and divert him.

2083
02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:15.630 line:82%
After that, I'll let you know
how to proceed.

2084
02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:17.560 line:82%
Meanwhile...

2085
02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:19.880 line:82%
anything could happen.

2086
02:19:20.310 --> 02:19:21.310 line:82%
My father may get suspicious.

2087
02:19:21.940 --> 02:19:23.630 line:82%
If he gets suspicious and cracks it...

2088
02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:27.010 line:82%
Don't hesitate because he's my father.

2089
02:19:28.350 --> 02:19:29.470 line:82%
I hope you understand.

2090
02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:48.540 line:82%
My father and I are differentfrom each other.

2091
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:51.310 line:82%
To him, honesty andrighteousness is important.

2092
02:19:51.970 --> 02:19:53.940 line:82%
I want to lead a happy life.

2093
02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:55.550 line:82%
For that money is important.

2094
02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:01.020 line:82%
If anyone interferes in my plan...

2095
02:20:01.890 --> 02:20:04.590 line:82%
even if it's my father.I don't like it.

2096
02:20:08.310 --> 02:20:09.930 line:82%
He lived his life on his terms.

2097
02:20:10.930 --> 02:20:13.030 line:82%
Hereafter, I want to live my lifeon my terms.

2098
02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:20.460 line:82%
[Vijaya] Hello, listen...

2099
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:24.580 line:82%
I want to go to the templebecause it is Arjun's birthday.

2100
02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:26.630 line:82%
Why don't you come home today?

2101
02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:28.680 line:82%
Why are you behaving differently?

2102
02:21:22.050 --> 02:21:22.630 line:82%
Dad...

2103
02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:28.700 line:82%
How are you?

2104
02:21:29.370 --> 02:21:31.250 line:82%
If not for you, I don't know
what would've happened to me.

2105
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:35.840 line:82%
I never expected
that you'd come to rescue me.

2106
02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:41.390 line:82%
I'm blessed to have a father like you.

2107
02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:47.000 line:82%
I feel like meeting,
Mom, Ritu, and Shwetha.

2108
02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:49.440 line:82%
Why did you bring me here?

2109
02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:52.540 line:82%
Come on, let's go home, Dad.

2110
02:21:55.650 --> 02:21:57.160 line:82%
Sure. We'll go.

2111
02:21:59.690 --> 02:22:00.800 line:82%
You look exhausted.

2112
02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:02.680 line:82%
Let's sit down and discuss.

2113
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:05.710 line:82%
-You may go outside.
-Okay, sir.

2114
02:22:13.850 --> 02:22:16.310 line:82%
I rescued you from a dangerous gang.

2115
02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:18.540 line:82%
I'm sure you were followed.

2116
02:22:18.770 --> 02:22:20.470 line:82%
If we head straight home...

2117
02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:22.320 line:82%
it would put the family in danger.

2118
02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:23.950 line:82%
I already spoke to the DGP.

2119
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:26.770 line:82%
Tomorrow morning we'll meet the DGP.

2120
02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:28.740 line:82%
You narrate everything
that happened to you.

2121
02:22:28.850 --> 02:22:31.970 line:82%
Only after we trace out the gang
and arrest them...

2122
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:33.030 line:82%
we can return home.

2123
02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:34.820 line:82%
That'll be safe for us.

2124
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:40.230 line:82%
Okay, Dad.

2125
02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:43.490 line:82%
I'm feeling weird.

2126
02:22:44.290 --> 02:22:47.370 line:82%
I'll take a rest and speak in the morning.

2127
02:22:52.450 --> 02:22:53.040 line:82%
Arjun!

2128
02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:57.040 line:82%
Do you have anything you'd like to tell me?

2129
02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:59.130 line:82%
I told you everything Dad.

2130
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:35.040 line:82%
-Paneer...
-Varma!

2131
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.870 line:82%
...please come.

2132
02:23:40.030 --> 02:23:41.610 line:82%
-What is it, Varma?
-Talk to him.

2133
02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:45.780 line:82%
Hello!

2134
02:23:46.450 --> 02:23:49.070 line:82%
The crown you sent for testing is a fake.

2135
02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:50.520 line:82%
It failed all the tests.

2136
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:52.930 line:82%
No! We oversaw the entire process.

2137
02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:55.210 line:82%
They tried to create a fakeas good as the original.

2138
02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:56.320 line:82%
But it's not an original.

2139
02:23:56.900 --> 02:23:57.640 line:82%
Not just here.

2140
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:59.290 line:82%
No matter how many tests you run,

2141
02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:00.850 line:82%
it won't pass the quality check.

2142
02:24:01.050 --> 02:24:02.670 line:82%
Because it's clearly a fake.

2143
02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:05.780 line:82%
I can assure you the crown is not a fake.

2144
02:24:06.370 --> 02:24:08.200 line:82%
We checked it thoroughly.
Please check again.

2145
02:24:08.350 --> 02:24:09.790 line:82%
We have checked it multiple times.

2146
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.840 line:82%
Fake?

2147
02:24:34.890 --> 02:24:35.690 line:82%
It's totally fake!

2148
02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:42.680 line:82%
You worked with me all along,
yet you delivered a fake.

2149
02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.050 line:82%
Dhanraj!

2150
02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:56.250 line:82%
You're my friend.

2151
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:58.180 line:82%
A very close friend.

2152
02:24:58.690 --> 02:25:01.400 line:82%
But I'm a professional.

2153
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:04.630 line:82%
100% professional!

2154
02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:09.910 line:82%
If you kill me, I will die for real.

2155
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:12.600 line:82%
I'll kill myself, Varma.

2156
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:14.230 line:82%
Take care!

2157
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:27.050 line:82%
Dad...

2158
02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:29.500 line:82%
For four and a half years...

2159
02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:31.930 line:82%
I have worked hard to discover every one

2160
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:33.940 line:82%
involved in this case.

2161
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:36.860 line:82%
Anything could've happened to me
during the process.

2162
02:25:37.490 --> 02:25:38.860 line:82%
I could have died.

2163
02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:40.010 line:82%
That's obvious.

2164
02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:41.730 line:82%
But if you get involved,

2165
02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:45.740 line:82%
it would appear as if I solved it
under your shadow.

2166
02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:50.810 line:82%
I will lose the due credit I deserve
from the department.

2167
02:25:51.450 --> 02:25:52.720 line:82%
Please give me a week.

2168
02:25:53.450 --> 02:25:56.920 line:82%
I will discover the entire network
and solve the case.

2169
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:59.470 line:82%
It would be best

2170
02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:01.940 line:82%
if you could stay away from this case

2171
02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:03.370 line:82%
until I resolve it.

2172
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:06.110 line:82%
Please, Dad, for my sake.

2173
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:09.470 line:82%
Okay, son.

2174
02:26:10.490 --> 02:26:10.980 line:82%
Okay.

2175
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:14.330 line:82%
As a precaution, keep it with you.

2176
02:26:23.490 --> 02:26:24.160 line:82%
Arjun!

2177
02:26:25.430 --> 02:26:27.050 line:82%
Do you have anything you'd like to tell me?

2178
02:26:27.810 --> 02:26:29.030 line:82%
I told you everything Dad.

2179
02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:40.900 line:82%
Hello, my father found out everything--

2180
02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:43.140 line:82%
[Varma] Not over the phone.It may get tapped.

2181
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:45.240 line:82%
We'll discuss this in person.

2182
02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:13.280 line:82%
Are you trying to scare me?

2183
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:15.100 line:82%
My father asked me to give a statement
to the Police.

2184
02:27:15.890 --> 02:27:17.130 line:82%
If I give the statement
to the Police...

2185
02:27:17.310 --> 02:27:19.180 line:82%
it would further complicate the situation.

2186
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:21.090 line:82%
I will handle it all.

2187
02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:23.920 line:82%
But first, let me tell you
two important things.

2188
02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:25.060 line:82%
What is it?

2189
02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:28.660 line:82%
The crown your father sent is a fake.

2190
02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:32.530 line:82%
Fake?

2191
02:27:34.690 --> 02:27:36.300 line:82%
Despite knowing it's fake,
what the hell are you doing?

2192
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:38.050 line:82%
What the heck were you doing?

2193
02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.080 line:82%
I agree it's my mistake.

2194
02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:42.780 line:82%
I have something else important
to share with you.

2195
02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:47.610 line:82%
Remember a pink color diamond
in the center of the crown?

2196
02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:52.050 line:82%
Inside it is a small camera.

2197
02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:53.760 line:82%
Camera?

2198
02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:00.320 line:82%
You know what it means.

2199
02:28:01.850 --> 02:28:04.230 line:82%
Your father watched everything
that happened out here.

2200
02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:09.180 line:82%
He must be aware that his son is a thief.

2201
02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:12.610 line:82%
We can expect him anytime
if he has sent me over here.

2202
02:28:13.430 --> 02:28:14.640 line:82%
First, lock my family.

2203
02:28:15.390 --> 02:28:17.820 line:82%
That'll be our leverage to escape from him.

2204
02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:19.720 line:82%
I'm already on it.

2205
02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:22.510 line:82%
I have sent men to lock your family.

2206
02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:25.530 line:82%
I transferred all the antiques
to another place.

2207
02:28:26.250 --> 02:28:27.910 line:82%
Only you're left to handle.

2208
02:28:28.430 --> 02:28:31.710 line:82%
How can he give me a fake crown
and take his original son?

2209
02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:33.230 line:82%
So, I'm going to kill you.

2210
02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:36.440 line:82%
And escape before Jailer gets here.

2211
02:28:54.970 --> 02:28:56.730 line:82%
I did warn you that he will come.

2212
02:29:37.090 --> 02:29:38.520 line:82%
Come on! Come!

2213
02:29:39.330 --> 02:29:39.870 line:82%
Come on!

2214
02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:12.370 line:82%
Come on!

2215
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:33.160 line:82%
Jailer, I know this is nothing to you.

2216
02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:34.580 line:82%
