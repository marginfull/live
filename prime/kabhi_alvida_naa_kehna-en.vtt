00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:12.083 line:82%
NEVER SAY GOODBYE

2
00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:41.833 line:82%
Maya... Maya, come on hurry up.
The groom will be here at one.

3
00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:57.583 line:82%
Yes, I'm married and I also have a son.
But just to make it clear,

4
00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:00.625 line:82%
I keep my personal life
and professional life separate.

5
00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.667 line:82%
But our fashion magazine needs
a lot of time.

6
00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:09.292 line:82%
Your magazine does not need time.
It needs me.

7
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.917 line:82%
Dad. Dad!

8
00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:49.208 line:82%
God, dad... And how did this break?

9
00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.708 line:82%
I'll teach you how. I will.

10
00:06:17.292 --> 00:06:19.083 line:82%
Dad, I'm getting married today and you...

11
00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:21.000 line:82%
What do I do, my son?

12
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.000 line:82%
Before dying your Mom made me
promise that after she goes...

13
00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:27.417 line:82%
I should do all that I never did
while she was alive...

14
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.167 line:82%
I'm just fulfilling my promise...

15
00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:32.417 line:82%
And what about the promise I made to Maya?
Can I fulfill that?

16
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.620 line:82%
-Why not?
-Can we go?

17
00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:35.000 line:82%
Just a minute... just a minute...

18
00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:38.458 line:82%
This is from me.

19
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:41.125 line:82%
And this from your Mom.

20
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.917 line:82%
God bless you, son. Be happy.

21
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.958 line:82%
What is this noise? I can't hear a thing.

22
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:11.458 line:82%
Nothing... Nothing at all.
Just a small match that we won.

23
00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.958 line:82%
I'm so sorry. I forgot completely.

24
00:07:16.417 --> 00:07:18.833 line:82%
Rhea, I'm your husband
just don't forget that.

25
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.458 line:82%
Tell me, how was it?

26
00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.375 line:82%
Fantastic. My last goal.
all that tension, excitement.

27
00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:31.000 line:82%
Rhea... Rhea, you should have been here.

28
00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:33.792 line:82%
But I had an interview.

29
00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:38.000 line:82%
You know what?

30
00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:41.250 line:82%
We'll fix up the next match after
checking with your busy schedule.

31
00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:44.208 line:82%
And if you have the time

32
00:07:44.292 --> 00:07:46.792 line:82%
just have a look at my five million
dollar contract.

33
00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:48.583 line:82%
Five million dollars?

34
00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:52.000 line:82%
Why? Jealous?
That now I earn more than you?

35
00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:56.083 line:82%
Not jealous baby. Happy.
Happy that your dream has come true.

36
00:07:57.417 --> 00:07:58.333 line:82%
Our dream, Rhea.

37
00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:02.958 line:82%
Yeah, I know. By the way,
I'm going to fetch Arjun from school.

38
00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:04.833 line:82%
will you please fetch Mom
from the wedding?

39
00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:07.083 line:82%
I completely forgot that...

40
00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:08.000 line:82%
What's the matter, Rhea?

41
00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:09.083 line:82%
You seem to be forgetting
a lot these days.

42
00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:40.958 line:82%
Today I'm going to part with my daughter
and get a daughter-in-law home.

43
00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:52.833 line:82%
It's taken her three years to say 'yes'.

44
00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:54.750 line:82%
She won't run away at the last minute,
will she?

45
00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:56.625 line:82%
No... No, she can't run away anywhere.

46
00:08:57.708 --> 00:08:59.833 line:82%
Yeah. After all where will she
find a husband like me, right?

47
00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:02.000 line:82%
No, our security is very tight.

48
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.000 line:82%
-Who Suzie?
-Not Suzie. Give it to me, come on. Go.

49
00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:18.708 line:82%
They'll drive me mad.
all the idiots from New York--

50
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.583 line:82%
-That scared me.
-Didn't mean to.

51
00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:33.167 line:82%
I'm Sam. And welcome to my humble home.

52
00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:35.375 line:82%
I'm Kamal, and this is my food.

53
00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.333 line:82%
Wow. Definitely a
Sardarni.

54
00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.042 line:82%
How did you know that?

55
00:09:45.292 --> 00:09:47.375 line:82%
Because I have been fed
and slapped by them.

56
00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:51.208 line:82%
I know.
I have heard a lot about you.

57
00:09:51.417 --> 00:09:52.917 line:82%
Don't go by what others say.

58
00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:55.417 line:82%
But all that's said is always
by others, Mr. Talwar.

59
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.958 line:82%
Whose word does one go by then?

60
00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:02.375 line:82%
Mine. My word.
You are from Chandigarh.

61
00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:05.417 line:82%
And how did you figure that out?

62
00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.583 line:82%
Mom. What are you doing?

63
00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.417 line:82%
Just. Nothing.

64
00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:23.292 line:82%
No, I don't know what's taking
the bride so long.

65
00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:25.000 line:82%
You carry on. I'll come on my own.

66
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.167 line:82%
Please don't mess the garden.

67
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.500 line:82%
I have just cleaned it up.

68
00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:45.250 line:82%
-Are you the gardener?
-What do you think?

69
00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:48.042 line:82%
I think you have
stolen the bride's clothes.

70
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:48.958 line:82%
Should I inform inside?

71
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.375 line:82%
It's your wedding
and you are sitting outside here. Why?

72
00:10:55.792 --> 00:10:56.792 line:82%
Do you have a problem?

73
00:10:56.875 --> 00:11:00.542 line:82%
Not directly. But indirectly I do.
My mother has a problem.

74
00:11:01.042 --> 00:11:04.625 line:82%
The faster you go inside,
the faster my mother can leave from here.

75
00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:07.167 line:82%
You are a strange man.
You sat down?

76
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:08.750 line:82%
Should I lie down and chat?

77
00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:11.292 line:82%
One to one discussions
always happen while seated.

78
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.958 line:82%
Discussion?

79
00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:14.500 line:82%
Yes. I know you have a problem.

80
00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:19.250 line:82%
Why should I discuss my problem with you?

81
00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:20.833 line:82%
So, you admit you have a problem.

82
00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:25.667 line:82%
By the way, I don't take
advice from anyone.

83
00:11:26.042 --> 00:11:28.042 line:82%
But I'm always ready
to give advice to others.

84
00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:31.458 line:82%
You should always listen to strangers.

85
00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:36.833 line:82%
Sometimes they know better than our own.

86
00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:40.250 line:82%
Are you married?

87
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.250 line:82%
It's five years today.

88
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:49.750 line:82%
What did you think before marrying?

89
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.375 line:82%
Who thinks before marrying?

90
00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:02.958 line:82%
Rhea and me, are friends from college.

91
00:12:03.708 --> 00:12:06.458 line:82%
So we thought we'd give our
friendship a new meaning.

92
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:13.167 line:82%
Besides what can be better than spending
your entire life with your friend?

93
00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:20.833 line:82%
At times friendship replaces love and
then there's no space left for love.

94
00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:28.250 line:82%
By the way, the guy
waiting for you inside,

95
00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:31.458 line:82%
is he your friend or your love?

96
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.333 line:82%
You can't take that long.

97
00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.000 line:82%
I have known Rishi since childhood.

98
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.167 line:82%
After my parents died, Rishi
and his father have been my family.

99
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.958 line:82%
What a sweet family.

100
00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:51.333 line:82%
But that's not the answer
to my question. Do you love him?

101
00:12:54.583 --> 00:13:00.500 line:82%
I do.
But not the way I thought I would.

102
00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:05.375 line:82%
like how? like in good books and bad films
That kind of love?

103
00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:11.208 line:82%
No. The way love ought to be.
That kind of love.

104
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.625 line:82%
That kind of love.
But where does it exist anymore?

105
00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:15.250 line:82%
listen to this.

106
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.208 line:82%
'The sagas of everlasting romances
have gone past long ago.

107
00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:24.208 line:82%
Just learn to make do
with tiny love stories.'

108
00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:32.042 line:82%
Does that mean you don't love your wife?

109
00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.542 line:82%
You can't take that long.

110
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.708 line:82%
We are happy.
We have made our little world together.

111
00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:48.833 line:82%
That's not the answer to my question.

112
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.167 line:82%
The question here is more
about your life than my answer.

113
00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:58.750 line:82%
You are at a crossroad in life
where there are two roads.

114
00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:04.500 line:82%
One that leads to happiness,
which I think you deserve

115
00:14:05.292 --> 00:14:06.583 line:82%
and the other that leads
to an endless wait.

116
00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:10.917 line:82%
wait for love.
Which you may never find.

117
00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:14.833 line:82%
What if I find that love after marriage?

118
00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:20.042 line:82%
if you don't look for it,
you won't find it.

119
00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:25.542 line:82%
And you are definitely not finding
it sitting on this bench.

120
00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:27.667 line:82%
Go inside and get married.

121
00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:29.208 line:82%
The wedding is waiting for you.

122
00:14:29.292 --> 00:14:32.042 line:82%
and here you are sitting
with a stranger making small talk.

123
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.417 line:82%
You should be ashamed.
What will people say?

124
00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:51.792 line:82%
Now go fast, get married and be happy.

125
00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:54.500 line:82%
Goodbye.

126
00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:59.125 line:82%
Not good bye.
Goodbye kills the hope of meeting again.

127
00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:01.542 line:82%
And who knows?
We may meet again.

128
00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:28.625 line:82%
Just like fragrance merges into breeze.

129
00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:34.417 line:82%
And fades away.

130
00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:41.458 line:82%
Intense moments, with time.

131
00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:47.792 line:82%
Have a way of seeming like dreams.

132
00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:56.167 line:82%
Who knows? We may meet again yet.

133
00:15:57.583 --> 00:16:02.917 line:82%
You should never say goodbye.

134
00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:08.000 line:82%
Never say goodbye.

135
00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:15.167 line:82%
Never say goodbye.

136
00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:21.667 line:82%
Never say goodbye.

137
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.250 line:82%
They say time heals all wounds.

138
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:34.250 line:82%
But in some relationships,
some wounds only get deeper with time.

139
00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.292 line:82%
That's the new fear that stalks New York.

140
00:18:14.583 --> 00:18:17.042 line:82%
Known as the Black Beast,
this dangerous criminal has kidnapped

141
00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:19.000 line:82%
yet another child from central Park.

142
00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:21.292 line:82%
No one knows if it is a man or a woman.

143
00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:23.125 line:82%
He's nicknamed Black Beast

144
00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:26.167 line:82%
because the criminal wears
a trademark long, black coat.

145
00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:29.250 line:82%
Police have asked parents to take
special care of their children.

146
00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:36.250 line:82%
Don't cry my, son.
Don't cry. I'm right here.

147
00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:43.792 line:82%
Sorry, sir. Please don't mind.
My Tinu here is just a little nervous.

148
00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.250 line:82%
He thinks the Black Beast
is going to kidnap him.

149
00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:48.958 line:82%
Why should I mind?
My leg's already broken.

150
00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:51.833 line:82%
Tinu, my small, fat little angel.

151
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.750 line:82%
the Black Beast will not kidnap you.

152
00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:55.958 line:82%
To kidnap you he has to lift you first.

153
00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:57.917 line:82%
And have you looked at your weight?

154
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.500 line:82%
My little fatso. Your son's not a child.
he is a bull... bull!

155
00:19:02.583 --> 00:19:03.417 line:82%
What?

156
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.292 line:82%
And with God's blessing
even if he manages to lift him

157
00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:08.000 line:82%
he will die of a heart attack.

158
00:19:08.083 --> 00:19:09.708 line:82%
-Mummy!
-You mean she's still alive?

159
00:19:09.792 --> 00:19:11.333 line:82%
How did she survive
the weight of your father?

160
00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:13.667 line:82%
-How rude!
-Rude? You football field!

161
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.875 line:82%
Just pick this football of yours
and leave right now.

162
00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:16.542 line:82%
Come on. Let's go.
We don't want to sit here.

163
00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:17.667 line:82%
Come on, go.
You should have asked before sitting.

164
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.917 line:82%
And by the way, does your entire family
ever fit in a single photograph?

165
00:19:23.917 --> 00:19:24.833 line:82%
Should we go?

166
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.042 line:82%
You know I'll leave when you want to.
What's the need to ask?

167
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.292 line:82%
I just asked a simple question.

168
00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.333 line:82%
Even I didn't answer in French.

169
00:19:32.917 --> 00:19:33.750 line:82%
I'm going home.

170
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.583 line:82%
Do you know the way home?

171
00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:38.833 line:82%
Yes, Dev. I know the way.
I just don't know you anymore.

172
00:19:40.292 --> 00:19:44.125 line:82%
It's strange. No one seems to have
a sense of humor this morning.

173
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.125 line:82%
Come on, let's go. Together.

174
00:19:56.708 --> 00:19:59.375 line:82%
-What is it?
-The house will collapse if you clean.

175
00:20:00.042 --> 00:20:00.917 line:82%
Rishi...

176
00:20:02.583 --> 00:20:04.417 line:82%
-What?
-Take off your pants.

177
00:20:05.083 --> 00:20:06.875 line:82%
-Take off what?
-Your pants.

178
00:20:07.417 --> 00:20:09.625 line:82%
-Here?
-Where, then?

179
00:20:14.417 --> 00:20:16.208 line:82%
Come on, Rishi. Quickly.
I don't have time.

180
00:20:16.292 --> 00:20:19.083 line:82%
I know. I've always wanted to do this
in the kitchen.

181
00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:28.083 line:82%
-Now it's your turn.
-Why?

182
00:20:28.875 --> 00:20:30.375 line:82%
Why? Then how are we?
It'll be kind of tough.

183
00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:32.958 line:82%
Rishi, I don't have to remove anything.

184
00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:35.750 line:82%
because my clothes have no stain.

185
00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:36.792 line:82%
Stain?

186
00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:40.708 line:82%
Yes. Stain. A big one.
And you were all set to go out with it.

187
00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:44.625 line:82%
When will you stop being
my mother and be my wife?

188
00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:47.958 line:82%
When you stop being my child
and become my husband.

189
00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:54.083 line:82%
If I stop being your child
who will you mother, then?

190
00:20:56.917 --> 00:20:57.750 line:82%
What happened?

191
00:20:58.083 --> 00:21:00.750 line:82%
Nothing.
Since I can't have children of my own.

192
00:21:01.083 --> 00:21:02.917 line:82%
I should think of you as my child, right?

193
00:21:03.417 --> 00:21:06.167 line:82%
Come on, Maya.
You know that's not what I meant.

194
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.000 line:82%
-I really don't care about that.
-Here. Take this. It's gone.

195
00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:12.660 line:82%
listen.

196
00:21:13.414 --> 00:21:15.208 line:82%
Tonight's the Sanderson Hotel opening.

197
00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:16.792 line:82%
-What time do you want to go?
-I'm not coming.

198
00:21:19.042 --> 00:21:21.875 line:82%
If I go alone everywhere people
will think there's a problem.

199
00:21:22.542 --> 00:21:24.750 line:82%
-I don't care about people.
-And me?

200
00:21:28.167 --> 00:21:31.333 line:82%
Look, Rishi.
This night life, events, parties.

201
00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:33.708 line:82%
I don't belong to that part of your life.

202
00:21:35.417 --> 00:21:36.875 line:82%
Then which part of my life
do you belong to, Maya?

203
00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:38.708 line:82%
Which part of my life
do you belong to, Rishi?

204
00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:42.625 line:82%
When was the last time we did
something that I wanted?

205
00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:44.958 line:82%
You want to clean the house.

206
00:21:56.958 --> 00:22:00.667 line:82%
This is great! You start something
and then don't want to pursue it.

207
00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:02.208 line:82%
Rishi, I want to discuss.

208
00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:31.875 line:82%
Diva is America's No.2 fashion magazine.
Thanks to you.

209
00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:59.583 line:82%
I just spoke to the London head office
and we think you should move there.

210
00:23:00.917 --> 00:23:04.375 line:82%
Yeah. So that you can control
all the fashion magazines in the group.

211
00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:10.792 line:82%
This will be the biggest move
of your career.

212
00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:14.708 line:82%
No, Jai. This will be a big move
for your company.

213
00:23:18.792 --> 00:23:21.458 line:82%
You are intelligent,
confident, beautiful.

214
00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:24.958 line:82%
Just one problem. You are married.

215
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.375 line:82%
But anyway married or unmarried.
How does it matter these days.

216
00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:32.792 line:82%
It matters to me, Jai.

217
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.833 line:82%
When I have said that we are not
organizing the party, why is he here?

218
00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:45.167 line:82%
He refuses to leave.
He says he won't go till we agree.

219
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.125 line:82%
-What do you mean he won't leave?
-He's even threatening to sue us.

220
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:48.542 line:82%
Sue. Who is he to?

221
00:23:48.792 --> 00:23:49.708 line:82%
I'll see to it.

222
00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:01.875 line:82%
But why?
You organize parties for the whole world.

223
00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:02.917 line:82%
Why can't you do it for your father?

224
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.708 line:82%
The whole world hasn't had
two heart attacks.

225
00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:06.750 line:82%
Give some thought to your age.

226
00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:09.083 line:82%
What's age?
Just look at my heart.

227
00:24:09.417 --> 00:24:11.417 line:82%
Ask the beauties around,
they think I'm a rock star.

228
00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:17.917 line:82%
Hey, listen.
Why are you being so difficult?

229
00:24:18.042 --> 00:24:20.583 line:82%
It's just a simple party to be organized.
Here, listen to me.

230
00:24:20.958 --> 00:24:22.816 line:82%
Just give me a sixties setting,

231
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.250 line:82%
the best wine
and a hundred beautiful girls. That's all.

232
00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:30.083 line:82%
And what do you plan to do
with hundred girls?

233
00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:38.167 line:82%
I want to know.
Why do you throw this party every year?

234
00:24:40.542 --> 00:24:41.375 line:82%
listen now.

235
00:24:41.458 --> 00:24:45.208 line:82%
Just organize this party
and my red Ferrari is yours.

236
00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:52.000 line:82%
If you think you can
buy me out by bribing me.

237
00:26:29.292 --> 00:26:30.625 line:82%
Where are you going, idiot?
Go...

238
00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:55.500 line:82%
Hit, Arjun. Hit.

239
00:27:37.708 --> 00:27:40.750 line:82%
I don't want to play football.
I want to play the violin.

240
00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:42.583 line:82%
What? You want to play the violin?

241
00:27:43.208 --> 00:27:44.750 line:82%
Wear a dress from tomorrow.

242
00:27:44.833 --> 00:27:46.875 line:82%
You will look perfect. Don't do that.
Just shut up.

243
00:27:50.792 --> 00:27:52.083 line:82%
Your son has lost the match again.

244
00:27:52.708 --> 00:27:53.833 line:82%
Looks like he's taken after his father.

245
00:27:56.167 --> 00:27:57.667 line:82%
Stop taking your anger out on him.

246
00:27:58.208 --> 00:28:00.000 line:82%
He'd probably have won
if you coached him well.

247
00:28:00.375 --> 00:28:03.542 line:82%
We'd probably have won
if you were here to boost our morale.

248
00:28:07.917 --> 00:28:10.542 line:82%
It's the Queen Mother for you.
Come on. Come on.

249
00:28:11.042 --> 00:28:14.958 line:82%
Mama, you have to be there for the
next match. You never come.

250
00:28:16.417 --> 00:28:17.667 line:82%
Next time I'll be there for sure.

251
00:28:18.042 --> 00:28:20.667 line:82%
Guess what?
Mama's got you a new PlayStation.

252
00:28:26.292 --> 00:28:29.042 line:82%
If they are selling some time
at the toy shop please buy that.

253
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.583 line:82%
Arjun needs that a little more.

254
00:28:34.833 --> 00:28:36.542 line:82%
Tansen, I'm going to buy the tickets.

255
00:28:36.958 --> 00:28:39.292 line:82%
If you move from here,
I will slap you.

256
00:28:39.792 --> 00:28:41.417 line:82%
Let's go home
and I'll make you wear a dress.

257
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:47.083 line:82%
OK, Tanya. Now listen to me.
Stay close to me all the time.

258
00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:49.542 line:82%
I read about the Black Beast this morning.

259
00:28:49.958 --> 00:28:51.917 line:82%
We never know where he might
be lurking in his black coat.

260
00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:54.125 line:82%
Now hold my hand. Is it clean?

261
00:28:55.875 --> 00:28:59.458 line:82%
Should we go here?
Or there? Who should I ask?

262
00:29:08.667 --> 00:29:14.667 line:82%
I saw you my beloved.

263
00:29:17.458 --> 00:29:22.917 line:82%
And it dawned on me how crazy love can be.

264
00:29:25.292 --> 00:29:26.125 line:82%
Me?

265
00:29:26.208 --> 00:29:29.750 line:82%
I saw you my beloved.

266
00:29:29.917 --> 00:29:31.917 line:82%
Here I come, Simran. Here I come.

267
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.125 line:82%
Black Beast. When will they nab him?

268
00:29:57.792 --> 00:30:01.125 line:82%
Got you. I told you
not to move from there?

269
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:02.458 line:82%
Then why did you move?

270
00:30:03.542 --> 00:30:07.250 line:82%
You kids have really troubled me today.
Specially you.

271
00:30:08.542 --> 00:30:09.917 line:82%
You know what I am going to do to you?

272
00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:13.458 line:82%
I'm going to cut you into tiny pieces

273
00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:16.792 line:82%
and put them in a mixer
to make Jamba juice.

274
00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:25.833 line:82%
Are we going to stand here all day?

275
00:30:26.083 --> 00:30:26.958 line:82%
Come with me now.

276
00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:36.958 line:82%
I don't know why children are born at all.

277
00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:38.875 line:82%
Why can't humans be born full grown?

278
00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:47.458 line:82%
I'm taking you to your Papa.
I won't let anything happen to you.

279
00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:51.542 line:82%
The next time you lose, I'm going to...

280
00:31:15.292 --> 00:31:19.167 line:82%
Give me a minute here. Come now. Run!

281
00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:26.500 line:82%
My ball!

282
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.280 line:82%
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

283
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.500 line:82%
She's become the Black Beast?

284
00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:14.958 line:82%
But why are you crying?

285
00:32:15.125 --> 00:32:16.625 line:82%
I thought I was being kidnapped.

286
00:32:16.792 --> 00:32:18.542 line:82%
I don't have such good fortune that
someone will kidnap you.

287
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.000 line:82%
NYC
EMS AMBULANCE

288
00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:11.292 line:82%
Arjun, tell the fatso...

289
00:33:40.208 --> 00:33:42.167 line:82%
all this is my husband's fault.

290
00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.583 line:82%
Your husband is the Black Beast?

291
00:33:43.792 --> 00:33:46.000 line:82%
No, he's just a beast.

292
00:33:51.542 --> 00:33:53.083 line:82%
Your wife is fine now.

293
00:33:57.708 --> 00:33:58.625 line:82%
Rishi Talwar.

294
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.958 line:82%
Rhea Saran.

295
00:34:08.958 --> 00:34:12.125 line:82%
I run a small PR firm named Kamakaze.

296
00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:14.708 line:82%
I've been trying to meet you for a while.

297
00:34:14.792 --> 00:34:16.542 line:82%
It's not easy meeting me.

298
00:34:16.625 --> 00:34:18.625 line:82%
Trust me, it's even more difficult
to avoid.

299
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.500 line:82%
My lawyer will speak with you.

300
00:34:51.583 --> 00:34:53.167 line:82%
And my lawyer will speak to you.

301
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.333 line:82%
You. I know you.

302
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.083 line:82%
Even I remember. We've met before.

303
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.625 line:82%
Now I can't walk for a week
because of you.

304
00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.958 line:82%
I can't walk for life because of you.

305
00:35:14.417 --> 00:35:15.292 line:82%
What?

306
00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:19.167 line:82%
If I hadn't met you, my life
would have been different.

307
00:35:19.292 --> 00:35:21.625 line:82%
My pain would have been different.

308
00:35:22.208 --> 00:35:24.125 line:82%
And if I hadn't met you
I wouldn't have married...

309
00:35:24.208 --> 00:35:25.833 line:82%
Wouldn't have married?

310
00:35:30.208 --> 00:35:32.125 line:82%
ls that a good thing or a bad thing?

311
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.083 line:82%
-Good.
-Good?

312
00:35:33.167 --> 00:35:34.583 line:82%
-Bad.
-Bad?

313
00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:42.458 line:82%
Are you happy?

314
00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:49.417 line:82%
-You can't take that long.
-Who are you to ask me all this?

315
00:35:49.625 --> 00:35:51.458 line:82%
You can't answer a question
with a question.

316
00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:52.917 line:82%
Why should I bother about your questions?

317
00:35:53.167 --> 00:35:55.083 line:82%
Why should I answer you? Who are you?

318
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.458 line:82%
I'm the father of the child you were
running away with.

319
00:36:01.208 --> 00:36:03.750 line:82%
Don't you have your own children?

320
00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:10.458 line:82%
You don't.

321
00:36:11.083 --> 00:36:13.208 line:82%
Yes. I don't have any.
I can't have them.

322
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.292 line:82%
I teach children.
I'm a mother to all of them.

323
00:36:16.583 --> 00:36:18.042 line:82%
Mother India.

324
00:36:18.833 --> 00:36:22.380 line:82%
Teaching children.
Running away with them,

325
00:36:22.458 --> 00:36:23.940 line:82%
Are you able to fill
your emptiness with it?

326
00:36:24.208 --> 00:36:27.458 line:82%
Because your life is empty. Incomplete.

327
00:36:28.792 --> 00:36:30.700 line:82%
It shows in your eyes.

328
00:36:33.792 --> 00:36:35.208 line:82%
Just like in mine.

329
00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:42.708 line:82%
Why did you take the trouble?

330
00:36:42.792 --> 00:36:44.250 line:82%
You are so considerate.

331
00:36:44.542 --> 00:36:47.000 line:82%
I'm beginning to feel pressurized
by your niceness.

332
00:37:05.208 --> 00:37:06.292 line:82%
Rishi Kapoor?

333
00:37:15.917 --> 00:37:16.750 line:82%
Goodbye.

334
00:37:18.875 --> 00:37:19.708 line:82%
No good bye.

335
00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:23.667 line:82%
Goodbye kills all hope of meeting again.

336
00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:27.708 line:82%
And who knows?
We might meet again.

337
00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:36.083 line:82%
Dev, no one ever wants to meet you again.

338
00:37:49.917 --> 00:37:52.667 line:82%
The doctor has said you'll
be fine in two to three days.

339
00:37:52.759 --> 00:37:54.079 line:82%
After that...

340
00:38:02.833 --> 00:38:06.250 line:82%
God. Not you. It's that...
What was his name?

341
00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:08.333 line:82%
Dev, he was talking nonsense

342
00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:10.542 line:82%
and did you see how
he was talking to his wife?

343
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:17.083 line:82%
Maya, not all husbands
can be as good as me.

344
00:38:19.208 --> 00:38:22.458 line:82%
To keep my heart at your feet.

345
00:38:58.625 --> 00:38:59.583 line:82%
You?

346
00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:02.458 line:82%
Of course not. It's someone else.
What a strange question.

347
00:39:02.542 --> 00:39:03.958 line:82%
You? Who else will I be?

348
00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:06.399 line:82%
-Whatever... I'm glad you are here.
-Were you thinking of me?

349
00:39:06.708 --> 00:39:09.019 line:82%
Yes... I've been thinking
of you for a week.

350
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.699 line:82%
listen all that I said that day
was because of the injection.

351
00:39:11.919 --> 00:39:15.500 line:82%
I'm married. And to think of a married man
in that way is a sin.

352
00:39:15.583 --> 00:39:17.000 line:82%
-You talk rubbish.
-Yeah.

353
00:39:17.167 --> 00:39:19.750 line:82%
I wanted to meet you to say that
the things you said to me that day--

354
00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:21.917 line:82%
Was true...
And the truth is always bitter.

355
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.583 line:82%
You are bitter. Not the truth.
And who are you?

356
00:39:24.667 --> 00:39:27.625 line:82%
The Supreme court?
To pass judgments on others lives?

357
00:39:32.083 --> 00:39:34.125 line:82%
listen. I'm very happy.
Thank you.

358
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.083 line:82%
You should think about your own life.

359
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:39.792 line:82%
I'm sure your life is empty
and your dreams, unfulfilled.

360
00:39:39.875 --> 00:39:41.917 line:82%
That's why you keep searching
for the same in others lives.

361
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.583 line:82%
Maya... Maya, just listen.

362
00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:56.917 line:82%
We are both alike, very alike.
I'm sorry.

363
00:39:57.958 --> 00:40:00.583 line:82%
We travel from the same station.
Both teach children.

364
00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:02.542 line:82%
Both of us are wounded.

365
00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:06.542 line:82%
It's just that my wounds show,
yours don't.

366
00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:15.958 line:82%
And can we discuss our sad lives
over coffee?

367
00:40:16.208 --> 00:40:19.000 line:82%
No, thank you.
My husband's waiting for me at home.

368
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.750 line:82%
Well, even Rhea must be home by now.

369
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.917 line:82%
Dude, what's going on here?

370
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.208 line:82%
What went on is over now.

371
00:41:03.042 --> 00:41:05.833 line:82%
We were just passing by
and so we thought we'd just...

372
00:41:12.708 --> 00:41:14.125 line:82%
If Maya arrives now she will kill me.

373
00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:15.500 line:82%
Papa is going to kill me.

374
00:41:15.667 --> 00:41:17.917 line:82%
Today was the music class
so I bunked football.

375
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.375 line:82%
No, my child. Nothing will happen.
I'll take care of it.

376
00:41:20.458 --> 00:41:21.917 line:82%
No, grandma he's going to kill me.

377
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.125 line:82%
Why will he kill you?

378
00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:24.875 line:82%
You are learning the guitar
and that's a good thing.

379
00:41:24.958 --> 00:41:26.500 line:82%
Not guitar, Mom.
violin.

380
00:41:26.708 --> 00:41:29.958 line:82%
violin... I don't understand
why he is so scared of Dev...

381
00:41:30.042 --> 00:41:32.125 line:82%
-But Mom, you don't understand.
-No, darling you relax.

382
00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:33.042 line:82%
But Mom.

383
00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:35.708 line:82%
Shut up! Nothing's going to happen.

384
00:41:35.917 --> 00:41:38.500 line:82%
I'll tell Dev that you are not well. OK?

385
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.125 line:82%
Why should we lie?

386
00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:46.708 line:82%
Now come on go upstairs and grandma will
give you a nice hot water bath.

387
00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:51.750 line:82%
Shit. Maya has come.
Please hide this one somewhere?

388
00:41:51.833 --> 00:41:53.250 line:82%
In my arms?

389
00:42:04.458 --> 00:42:06.042 line:82%
-Son, do you know--
-I know.

390
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.833 line:82%
I know everything.

391
00:42:10.333 --> 00:42:11.917 line:82%
Everything? No. I think you.

392
00:42:15.917 --> 00:42:21.083 line:82%
Don't try to hide
from me I know everything.

393
00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:24.167 line:82%
Yes, I know. I saw it with my eyes.

394
00:42:25.292 --> 00:42:26.417 line:82%
Did you hear that? She knows everything.

395
00:42:26.542 --> 00:42:28.375 line:82%
Look at this.
And we were trying to hide from her.

396
00:42:28.875 --> 00:42:31.083 line:82%
Dad! Even you know?

397
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:34.583 line:82%
What do you mean when did I know?
It was my idea to make an excuse.

398
00:42:34.667 --> 00:42:36.375 line:82%
Now the poor fellow is hiding
in the bathroom.

399
00:42:37.667 --> 00:42:38.667 line:82%
He's in my bathroom?

400
00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:40.083 line:82%
She is in my bedroom?

401
00:42:40.875 --> 00:42:43.667 line:82%
Don't go in.
Poor thing, she's not wearing anything.

402
00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:45.500 line:82%
What is she doing without clothes?

403
00:42:51.792 --> 00:42:52.958 line:82%
What do you do without clothes?

404
00:42:54.583 --> 00:42:58.667 line:82%
-I will not let him live. I'm going to--
-What are you doing?

405
00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:03.859 line:82%
I am begging. He's already too scared.
I'm going to him now.

406
00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:05.879 line:82%
-Why?
-To give him a bath.

407
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:09.250 line:82%
So now you will bathe him?
That too in my bathroom.

408
00:43:09.458 --> 00:43:10.799 line:82%
The bathroom doesn't belong to just you.

409
00:43:10.959 --> 00:43:14.500 line:82%
It's mine, too. He will use it...
Both of us will bathe him.

410
00:43:16.625 --> 00:43:18.208 line:82%
How could you do this?
Aren't you ashamed?

411
00:43:18.292 --> 00:43:19.542 line:82%
But what have I done?

412
00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:21.625 line:82%
Please. Please! You two stop fighting.

413
00:43:21.708 --> 00:43:22.708 line:82%
I'm taking her to my house.

414
00:43:22.792 --> 00:43:24.167 line:82%
Why would you take her to your house?

415
00:43:24.417 --> 00:43:26.708 line:82%
-Because I paid her.
-She takes money?

416
00:43:26.792 --> 00:43:28.542 line:82%
Yeah. Nothing comes for free these days.

417
00:43:28.917 --> 00:43:30.375 line:82%
By the way what's the rate these days?

418
00:43:30.583 --> 00:43:32.958 line:82%
-Per day or weekends?
-Weekends.

419
00:43:35.542 --> 00:43:37.042 line:82%
Both of you have gone crazy.

420
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.625 line:82%
No, Dev. You are crazy.

421
00:43:38.708 --> 00:43:39.833 line:82%
Look at what you are doing.

422
00:43:39.958 --> 00:43:41.875 line:82%
I can't take this anymore.
I'm sleeping with him tonight.

423
00:43:41.958 --> 00:43:43.125 line:82%
-Me, too.
-You, too?

424
00:43:43.208 --> 00:43:45.417 line:82%
Have some shame.
Look at his age and yours.

425
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.542 line:82%
You look at your age.

426
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:47.542 line:82%
Don't cross your limits.

427
00:43:49.125 --> 00:43:50.708 line:82%
What about your limits?

428
00:43:50.875 --> 00:43:53.792 line:82%
The two of you... both...

429
00:43:57.399 --> 00:44:01.125 line:82%
And she. I will not spare her. Rhea!

430
00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:18.990 line:82%
He was just inviting me
for his Dad's party

431
00:44:19.074 --> 00:44:20.458 line:82%
so that I can see his work.

432
00:44:20.833 --> 00:44:22.417 line:82%
It's just a PR exercise, Dev.

433
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.333 line:82%
What about the flowers?

434
00:44:23.417 --> 00:44:25.125 line:82%
Rhea sent them for you.

435
00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:31.292 line:82%
And who is this?

436
00:44:31.542 --> 00:44:34.333 line:82%
This? This is your mother to be.

437
00:44:40.208 --> 00:44:42.083 line:82%
You thought I was having
an affair with Rishi?

438
00:44:42.417 --> 00:44:45.333 line:82%
What's with you, Dev?
You are crazy.

439
00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:49.042 line:82%
I'm crazy? I thought you were crazy.

440
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.458 line:82%
I mean, what's happened to your taste?

441
00:44:51.958 --> 00:44:54.083 line:82%
The next time you want
to have an affair let me know.

442
00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:55.792 line:82%
I will look for the right guy.

443
00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:00.625 line:82%
After all, you have to maintain a standard
the great Rhea Saran.

444
00:45:01.125 --> 00:45:04.583 line:82%
Dev, don't try to hide your feelings
with your stupid sense of humor.

445
00:45:04.958 --> 00:45:07.375 line:82%
You were jealous and I love it...

446
00:45:07.458 --> 00:45:08.875 line:82%
Yeah, right!

447
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.958 line:82%
This just means that somewhere
there is a little love left.

448
00:45:14.417 --> 00:45:15.583 line:82%
Yes, very deep inside.

449
00:45:16.542 --> 00:45:20.417 line:82%
Come on get ready. I'm ready to go.

450
00:45:21.417 --> 00:45:22.359 line:82%
You are coming wearing this?

451
00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:25.125 line:82%
No... I'm taking this off and coming nude.

452
00:45:25.417 --> 00:45:28.542 line:82%
No, Dev. Why don't you wear
the suit that I bought last week.

453
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.708 line:82%
Embarrassed, that I'm wearing this?

454
00:45:34.333 --> 00:45:35.583 line:82%
Embarrassed, that in these clothes

455
00:45:35.792 --> 00:45:38.667 line:82%
I won't look like the rich and famous
Rhea Saran's husband?

456
00:45:43.417 --> 00:45:46.999 line:82%
But even new clothes are not
going to make me new.

457
00:45:47.667 --> 00:45:52.083 line:82%
Even I love the old Dev
but he is lost somewhere.

458
00:45:56.375 --> 00:45:57.542 line:82%
You are the one who lost him.

459
00:46:23.083 --> 00:46:24.167 line:82%
What are you doing, Rishi?

460
00:46:30.375 --> 00:46:32.833 line:82%
My wife's jealous.
I got some reaction at last.

461
00:46:32.917 --> 00:46:34.667 line:82%
God, Rishi. Stop behaving like a child.

462
00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:43.375 line:82%
Tell me something.
What if I was really having an affair?

463
00:46:43.625 --> 00:46:45.542 line:82%
-What would you do?
-Rishi.

464
00:46:45.833 --> 00:46:48.542 line:82%
-Come on. Humor me.
-Rishi!

465
00:46:49.125 --> 00:46:55.042 line:82%
OK. If you were truly having
an affair I would think, analyze

466
00:46:55.333 --> 00:46:57.083 line:82%
and try to find out why it happened.

467
00:46:57.583 --> 00:46:58.958 line:82%
And then I would discuss it with you.

468
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.542 line:82%
Discuss with me?

469
00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:06.083 line:82%
Say that you would scream, shout,

470
00:47:06.292 --> 00:47:07.458 line:82%
or weep hysterically. Some drama.

471
00:47:07.583 --> 00:47:10.500 line:82%
Drama? If you wanted drama you
should have married an actress.

472
00:47:10.667 --> 00:47:12.750 line:82%
But you settled for a boring teacher.
So sorry.

473
00:47:12.833 --> 00:47:15.667 line:82%
God, Maya. You are so touchy.

474
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.125 line:82%
-Then why do you say such things?
-I was just kidding.

475
00:47:18.583 --> 00:47:21.000 line:82%
What if I was having an affair?
What would you do?

476
00:47:30.292 --> 00:47:31.583 line:82%
What was so funny?

477
00:47:31.708 --> 00:47:32.667 line:82%
What do you mean what's funny?

478
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.458 line:82%
You can't handle one relationship.

479
00:47:34.542 --> 00:47:35.667 line:82%
How will you manage two?

480
00:47:43.208 --> 00:47:47.667 line:82%
What's the matter, Rishi?
I can't handle a relationship.

481
00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:54.625 line:82%
I'm not a good wife, can't be a mother.

482
00:47:56.458 --> 00:47:59.625 line:82%
Since I have so many flaws,
why don't you leave me?

483
00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:04.750 line:82%
Both of us have flaws, Maya.

484
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.750 line:82%
But the difference is that you always talk

485
00:48:08.833 --> 00:48:10.583 line:82%
about breaking the relationship,

486
00:48:11.625 --> 00:48:12.792 line:82%
and I talk about making it work.

487
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:36.750 line:82%
Hasn't the size of Chandigarh
increased since the last time we met?

488
00:48:37.083 --> 00:48:39.292 line:82%
It's the number in your eye
that has increased, Mr. Talwar.

489
00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:43.417 line:82%
Hello. Aren't you going
to introduce me to your daughter?

490
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.619 line:82%
Daughter? Maybe yours.

491
00:48:46.125 --> 00:48:47.000 line:82%
Saturday?

492
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.792 line:82%
Yeah. I can't remember all their names

493
00:48:49.875 --> 00:48:51.167 line:82%
so I call them by the day I meet them.

494
00:48:56.417 --> 00:48:57.833 line:82%
-Who's that?
-My mother.

495
00:49:10.792 --> 00:49:12.792 line:82%
I'm Rishi's father in every way.

496
00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:16.667 line:82%
And I'm Rhea's husband,
in almost every way.

497
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.875 line:82%
Do you like my suit? Do you like it?

498
00:49:20.167 --> 00:49:22.542 line:82%
Rhea, you look gorgeous.

499
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:23.583 line:82%
Thank you.

500
00:49:23.667 --> 00:49:25.042 line:82%
I really think we should have that affair.

501
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:28.875 line:82%
I know for a fact
that my husband will not object.

502
00:49:29.417 --> 00:49:32.875 line:82%
Neither will my wife,
as long as we sit and discuss it later.

503
00:49:33.042 --> 00:49:33.875 line:82%
Right, darling?

504
00:49:34.083 --> 00:49:36.542 line:82%
Oh, wow.
You guys have discussions at home?

505
00:49:37.458 --> 00:49:40.208 line:82%
In our case we have
to meet by appointment.

506
00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:56.750 line:82%
Do you know a good divorce lawyer?

507
00:50:01.667 --> 00:50:04.750 line:82%
I think these parties are organized
to touch other people's wives.

508
00:50:09.625 --> 00:50:10.667 line:82%
I haven't reached such desperate days.

509
00:50:16.417 --> 00:50:17.583 line:82%
Your stupid "Muwahs".

510
00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:21.500 line:82%
You know, I have just realized that
not only do I hate parties.

511
00:50:22.083 --> 00:50:23.083 line:82%
I hate people.

512
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:27.917 line:82%
As far as I know, even people
aren't crazy about you.

513
00:50:29.333 --> 00:50:32.167 line:82%
Not that they are crowding
around you either.

514
00:50:32.833 --> 00:50:36.417 line:82%
It doesn't make a difference to me.
They are all strangers.

515
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:38.333 line:82%
Even your husband?

516
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:46.083 line:82%
Rishi...

517
00:51:14.083 --> 00:51:15.667 line:82%
Fair skinned faces

518
00:51:16.917 --> 00:51:18.208 line:82%
Moon lit faces

519
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.500 line:82%
Dark long tresses

520
00:51:22.042 --> 00:51:23.417 line:82%
Sky blue eyes

521
00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:25.750 line:82%
Fair skinned faces

522
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.333 line:82%
Moon lit faces

523
00:51:29.625 --> 00:51:30.958 line:82%
Dark long tresses

524
00:51:32.083 --> 00:51:33.417 line:82%
Sky blue eyes

525
00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:36.000 line:82%
They weave dreams

526
00:51:36.083 --> 00:51:37.333 line:82%
They lead you astray

527
00:51:37.417 --> 00:51:39.417 line:82%
Take away your sanity

528
00:51:39.708 --> 00:51:41.208 line:82%
They drive you crazy

529
00:51:41.458 --> 00:51:42.375 line:82%
They ignite a fire

530
00:51:42.583 --> 00:51:44.708 line:82%
Intoxicate your being

531
00:51:44.792 --> 00:51:46.500 line:82%
Rock and roll, my love

532
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.417 line:82%
My heart sings for you

533
00:51:49.792 --> 00:51:51.750 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

534
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.792 line:82%
come sway with me

535
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

536
00:51:57.375 --> 00:51:59.500 line:82%
My heart sings for you

537
00:51:59.917 --> 00:52:01.958 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

538
00:52:02.083 --> 00:52:04.292 line:82%
come sway with me

539
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.167 line:82%
These lithe bodies

540
00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:42.292 line:82%
These swaying hips

541
00:52:43.167 --> 00:52:45.333 line:82%
First they attack the heart

542
00:52:45.417 --> 00:52:47.250 line:82%
Then go for your life

543
00:52:47.917 --> 00:52:50.042 line:82%
These flashes of lightning

544
00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:52.542 line:82%
These sorceresses of love

545
00:52:53.125 --> 00:52:57.208 line:82%
I have seen many and yet fall prey

546
00:52:57.583 --> 00:53:00.000 line:82%
They come and they go

547
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:02.792 line:82%
At their whim and fancy

548
00:53:02.958 --> 00:53:05.083 line:82%
These angels these fairies

549
00:53:05.292 --> 00:53:07.875 line:82%
At a mere glance from them

550
00:53:08.083 --> 00:53:10.625 line:82%
The world can go crazy

551
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:12.708 line:82%
And be at their feet

552
00:53:13.208 --> 00:53:15.667 line:82%
And yet these beauties

553
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.125 line:82%
Don't know what love is

554
00:53:18.208 --> 00:53:20.333 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

555
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:22.917 line:82%
My heart sings for you

556
00:53:23.208 --> 00:53:25.333 line:82%
Rock and roll

557
00:53:25.417 --> 00:53:28.167 line:82%
come sway with me

558
00:53:28.279 --> 00:53:30.375 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

559
00:53:30.542 --> 00:53:32.708 line:82%
My heart sings for you

560
00:53:33.167 --> 00:53:35.250 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

561
00:53:35.625 --> 00:53:38.292 line:82%
come sway with me

562
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:52.792 line:82%
Head in a cap and a red scarf waving

563
00:53:52.875 --> 00:53:55.833 line:82%
What do I say?

564
00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:10.417 line:82%
Fair skinned maiden
with a black strand on the face

565
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.708 line:82%
What do I say?

566
00:54:31.417 --> 00:54:33.833 line:82%
These pretty faces

567
00:54:33.917 --> 00:54:36.375 line:82%
These beautiful women

568
00:54:36.625 --> 00:54:38.958 line:82%
They don't know what love is

569
00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:40.750 line:82%
Or what it is to be loyal

570
00:54:40.917 --> 00:54:44.042 line:82%
These stone hearted lovers

571
00:54:44.125 --> 00:54:46.542 line:82%
What do they care?

572
00:54:46.625 --> 00:54:51.167 line:82%
What we go through coping with them?

573
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.500 line:82%
They are ignorant like strangers

574
00:54:53.875 --> 00:54:55.750 line:82%
What do they know about feelings?

575
00:54:55.879 --> 00:54:58.750 line:82%
They don't know
they don't care

576
00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:01.833 line:82%
That hearts can break with words they say

577
00:55:01.917 --> 00:55:04.083 line:82%
like asking for comfort from fire

578
00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:06.500 line:82%
Or fire from ice
We have spent out entire lives

579
00:55:06.833 --> 00:55:09.292 line:82%
Now we know what we lost

580
00:55:09.375 --> 00:55:11.833 line:82%
Wasting our time that was precious

581
00:55:11.917 --> 00:55:14.167 line:82%
Rock and roll

582
00:55:14.458 --> 00:55:16.583 line:82%
My heart sings for you

583
00:55:16.875 --> 00:55:19.042 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

584
00:55:19.125 --> 00:55:21.625 line:82%
come sway with me

585
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.083 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

586
00:55:24.542 --> 00:55:26.542 line:82%
My heart sings for you

587
00:55:27.042 --> 00:55:29.042 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

588
00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:32.250 line:82%
come sway with me

589
00:55:54.819 --> 00:55:56.167 line:82%
Fair skinned faces

590
00:55:57.083 --> 00:55:58.042 line:82%
Moon lit faces

591
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.208 line:82%
Dark long tresses

592
00:56:01.667 --> 00:56:02.625 line:82%
Sky blue eyes

593
00:56:03.625 --> 00:56:05.542 line:82%
They weave dreams
They lead you astray

594
00:56:05.625 --> 00:56:07.959 line:82%
Take away your sanity
They drive you crazy

595
00:56:08.042 --> 00:56:11.819 line:82%
They ignite a fire
Intoxicate your being

596
00:56:12.292 --> 00:56:14.239 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

597
00:56:14.792 --> 00:56:16.750 line:82%
My heart sings for you

598
00:56:16.833 --> 00:56:18.667 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

599
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:21.042 line:82%
come sway with me

600
00:56:21.125 --> 00:56:23.125 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

601
00:56:23.417 --> 00:56:25.479 line:82%
My heart sings for you

602
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:27.739 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

603
00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:30.292 line:82%
come sway with me

604
00:56:30.375 --> 00:56:32.333 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

605
00:56:32.458 --> 00:56:34.250 line:82%
My heart sings for you

606
00:56:34.875 --> 00:56:36.667 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

607
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:39.167 line:82%
come sway with me

608
00:56:39.417 --> 00:56:41.583 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

609
00:56:41.708 --> 00:56:43.500 line:82%
My heart sings for you

610
00:56:43.583 --> 00:56:45.583 line:82%
Rock and roll my love

611
00:56:45.667 --> 00:56:48.239 line:82%
come sway with me

612
00:57:08.208 --> 00:57:11.167 line:82%
You know, people always ask me
why I throw this party every year.

613
00:57:12.667 --> 00:57:14.667 line:82%
What's so special about this day?

614
00:57:17.083 --> 00:57:18.458 line:82%
The day is special.

615
00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:23.625 line:82%
It's on this day

616
00:57:24.792 --> 00:57:27.042 line:82%
that I met my wife for the first time.

617
00:57:29.042 --> 00:57:34.125 line:82%
That's why, every year, I celebrate

618
00:57:35.417 --> 00:57:36.792 line:82%
this day and also seek her forgiveness.

619
00:57:40.417 --> 00:57:42.458 line:82%
Forgiveness for each day...

620
00:57:43.417 --> 00:57:47.375 line:82%
when I chose my dreams
over my relationships.

621
00:57:50.542 --> 00:57:51.917 line:82%
Forgiveness for each minute when...

622
00:57:53.792 --> 00:57:58.042 line:82%
I hurt her and didn't even
bother to make up.

623
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:04.042 line:82%
But, most of all,

624
00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:10.042 line:82%
forgiveness for
all those innumerable moments.

625
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:15.750 line:82%
when I forgot to tell her
how much I loved her.

626
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000 line:82%
Assuming that...

627
00:58:28.375 --> 00:58:30.167 line:82%
I will have a lot of time to say so.

628
00:58:33.833 --> 00:58:35.208 line:82%
But I was wrong.

629
00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:41.417 line:82%
With her death I lost that time.

630
00:58:45.375 --> 00:58:46.708 line:82%
That's why...

631
00:58:48.333 --> 00:58:51.958 line:82%
always say
that time means now.

632
00:58:53.792 --> 00:58:55.792 line:82%
If you have to love, love now.

633
00:58:57.083 --> 00:58:58.875 line:82%
If you have to ask for forgiveness,
ask now.

634
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.417 line:82%
If you want to hold hands, hold it now.

635
00:59:05.833 --> 00:59:10.167 line:82%
Or else years later you will find
yourself at a party like me

636
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:12.792 line:82%
asking for forgiveness from your beloved.

637
00:59:46.167 --> 00:59:47.667 line:82%
Hey, Chandigarh.

638
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.083 line:82%
Last night I encountered
the real Samarjit hidden

639
01:00:10.167 --> 01:00:12.333 line:82%
behind 'Sexy Sam'.
I liked him.

640
01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:19.958 line:82%
And what was the difference
between Sam and Samarjit?

641
01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:25.042 line:82%
Sam runs after girls and Samarjit
after memories.

642
01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:32.833 line:82%
I can understand.

643
01:00:34.958 --> 01:00:38.750 line:82%
Tell me.
How do you cope with your loneliness?

644
01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:42.125 line:82%
I spend time with friends.

645
01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:47.458 line:82%
I have very few friends.

646
01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:49.042 line:82%
Not from today.

647
01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:51.833 line:82%
So you will be my friend?

648
01:00:54.292 --> 01:00:55.792 line:82%
So, friendship means no touching?

649
01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:28.292 line:82%
What are your intentions?

650
01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:29.458 line:82%
The intentions are very noble, my son.

651
01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:31.417 line:82%
Just that I won't take dowry.
I'm anti dowry.

652
01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:33.042 line:82%
Mom, what is he saying?

653
01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.458 line:82%
-Sam, what are you saying?
-Kamal, what is he saying?

654
01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.208 line:82%
What are all of you saying?

655
01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:39.958 line:82%
I'm scared to come out of the station.

656
01:01:40.417 --> 01:01:41.917 line:82%
You never know what you'll get to see.

657
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.083 line:82%
Not only the station, you should not get
out of the house at all.

658
01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.000 line:82%
The world is evil.

659
01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:49.542 line:82%
Sam, just a minute. Both of us.

660
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.625 line:82%
Wow! So now it's 'us'?

661
01:01:54.292 --> 01:01:58.375 line:82%
Samarjit and l, are both alone.

662
01:01:59.458 --> 01:02:02.375 line:82%
We lost our love years ago.

663
01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:06.125 line:82%
And when two people are going
through the same phase.

664
01:02:06.667 --> 01:02:11.250 line:82%
They understand each other better.
They become close.

665
01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:15.792 line:82%
What they can't say to others,
they can say to each other.

666
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.833 line:82%
Precisely.
Two strangers. Same situation.

667
01:02:20.042 --> 01:02:21.875 line:82%
Then friendship
and the problem is solved.

668
01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:24.999 line:82%
That's it.
Simple. Right, Maya?

669
01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:02.375 line:82%
My marriage is failing, Dev.

670
01:03:04.458 --> 01:03:07.292 line:82%
And from what I can see, so is yours.

671
01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:15.958 line:82%
I can't save my marriage on my own.
I need a friend.

672
01:03:17.375 --> 01:03:22.250 line:82%
A friend who will understand me.
who will make me understand.

673
01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:24.667 line:82%
Who is familiar with my circumstance.

674
01:03:25.458 --> 01:03:26.958 line:82%
And who can do this better than you?

675
01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:30.542 line:82%
That's why I'm here to extend
a hand in friendship.

676
01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:32.375 line:82%
Will you accept it?

677
01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:44.333 line:82%
I'm hurt, Maya.
I want to sit down.

678
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.167 line:82%
And that's how two strangers
came together

679
01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:21.500 line:82%
to save their relationships,
and gave birth to a new one.

680
01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:28.000 line:82%
On that rainy day, neither of us
saw the storm that awaited us.

681
01:04:30.208 --> 01:04:31.500 line:82%
After that we met every day.

682
01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:34.542 line:82%
I don't know why, but when I was
with Maya, I was different.

683
01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.833 line:82%
I had found my lost smile.

684
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.333 line:82%
We had considerably increased the business

685
01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:40.708 line:82%
of the New York cafes quite a lot.

686
01:04:41.833 --> 01:04:44.667 line:82%
We spoke a lot about Rhea and Rishi.

687
01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:46.208 line:82%
How wrong they were.

688
01:04:46.417 --> 01:04:50.250 line:82%
How right we were, then how right
they were and how wrong we were.

689
01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:53.958 line:82%
But in relationships, no matter
who's right and who's wrong.

690
01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:57.417 line:82%
Someone has to make the first move.

691
01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:01.458 line:82%
And we decided it should be ours.

692
01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:04.792 line:82%
This is a very interesting book.

693
01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:07.708 line:82%
It says don't look for your spouse's
faults in your marriage.

694
01:05:08.042 --> 01:05:09.042 line:82%
Improve your own flaws.

695
01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:10.542 line:82%
And what if someone's perfect?

696
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.792 line:82%
Yeah, right. Anyway let's start with me.

697
01:05:14.458 --> 01:05:16.417 line:82%
Tell me all the things
that are wrong with me.

698
01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:19.417 line:82%
And listen tell me the truth. Be frank.

699
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.792 line:82%
be honest or there's no point.

700
01:05:20.919 --> 01:05:24.417 line:82%
Alright, here goes.
You are that teacher who is...

701
01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:27.458 line:82%
Boring with no personalty.

702
01:05:27.542 --> 01:05:29.250 line:82%
You are a compulsive cleaner
to the point of illness.

703
01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:32.458 line:82%
Basically, you are a loyal maidservant.

704
01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:33.375 line:82%
What?

705
01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:34.708 line:82%
You don't have anything womanly in you.

706
01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:39.417 line:82%
You are not sexy.
Not from any angle.

707
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.042 line:82%
Maybe from behind.

708
01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:43.417 line:82%
But no man
will get excited looking at you.

709
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.917 line:82%
I know, your husband gets excited

710
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.167 line:82%
but that's probably because
he is visually impaired.

711
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.917 line:82%
What mean? Rude?
Didn't you just ask me to speak the truth?

712
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.208 line:82%
But you could have said something nice.

713
01:05:55.292 --> 01:05:56.125 line:82%
But did you ask me to say something nice?

714
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:58.125 line:82%
And what would you say if I had?

715
01:05:58.833 --> 01:06:00.750 line:82%
That your eyes are the most
beautiful eyes in the world.

716
01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.917 line:82%
But you didn't ask, so I didn't say.

717
01:06:05.542 --> 01:06:08.542 line:82%
You know what your problem is?
You don't know how to speak to a lady.

718
01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:09.500 line:82%
And you know how?

719
01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:11.792 line:82%
Yes, I know what to say to women and how.

720
01:06:11.875 --> 01:06:12.917 line:82%
So you are a lesbian?

721
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.333 line:82%
I know because my husband says

722
01:06:14.417 --> 01:06:15.750 line:82%
the most romantic things to me everyday

723
01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:17.375 line:82%
Any woman would go crazy listening to them

724
01:06:17.583 --> 01:06:21.542 line:82%
-Right. Except you, of course.
-Listen. Do you want to learn or no?

725
01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:28.542 line:82%
Wow. This place has so many beds.

726
01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:32.833 line:82%
Maya, if you were so desperate,
we could have booked a hotel room.

727
01:06:33.125 --> 01:06:34.083 line:82%
Why have we come here?

728
01:06:34.875 --> 01:06:38.042 line:82%
listen, Dev.
I have no time for your sense of humor.

729
01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:39.542 line:82%
You have to learn a lot on this bed...

730
01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:42.625 line:82%
On this bed? What are the new things
you are going to teach me here?

731
01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:46.375 line:82%
Just so you know only my leg is broken.
All the other parts are perfect.

732
01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:57.792 line:82%
The situation is that
Rhea has come back tired from work.

733
01:06:58.083 --> 01:07:00.208 line:82%
Now I will tell you what you need to do.

734
01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.083 line:82%
Oh, yeah. I'm Rhea.

735
01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:20.958 line:82%
Rhea would say.
As soon as she came home.

736
01:07:34.708 --> 01:07:35.542 line:82%
Here?

737
01:07:46.125 --> 01:07:49.625 line:82%
Oh, Rhea. You are so beautiful!

738
01:07:52.375 --> 01:07:56.500 line:82%
Rhea... Your eyes... Your lips...

739
01:07:58.167 --> 01:07:59.792 line:82%
Your everything.

740
01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:07.667 line:82%
Your arms... I want to die in them.

741
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.039 line:82%
Maya, Rishi...

742
01:08:53.922 --> 01:08:56.208 line:82%
says and does all these things to you.

743
01:08:58.542 --> 01:09:01.917 line:82%
And yet you don't... you don't...

744
01:09:12.875 --> 01:09:15.333 line:82%
Actually, you are quite sexy. Really.

745
01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:19.792 line:82%
You just need to show it to Rishi.
That's all.

746
01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:35.667 line:82%
-What's this?
-This is my sister.

747
01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:37.375 line:82%
-What?
-We were separated as children.

748
01:09:38.458 --> 01:09:41.167 line:82%
You need to wear clothes like
these for your husband.

749
01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:44.167 line:82%
No. Dev.
If I wear clothes like these.

750
01:09:44.833 --> 01:09:46.000 line:82%
I will look like 'that' type of a woman

751
01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.375 line:82%
Yeah. That's the type that men like.

752
01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:50.375 line:82%
But that looks cheap.

753
01:09:50.458 --> 01:09:52.875 line:82%
Yeah, cheap. Cheap is nice.

754
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.292 line:82%
You taught me how to talk to women,

755
01:09:57.779 --> 01:09:59.583 line:82%
how to massage them, how to romance them.

756
01:09:59.833 --> 01:10:04.659 line:82%
If you want to learn how to be sexy,
then ask me. I'm the man.

757
01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:07.833 line:82%
Don't worry. This will protect you.

758
01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:09.542 line:82%
But this.

759
01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:13.833 line:82%
But not that. 'Butt' this.

760
01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:19.625 line:82%
Did you tell Maya about this last
minute football party?

761
01:10:21.333 --> 01:10:22.667 line:82%
You think she'd allow if I told her?

762
01:10:27.917 --> 01:10:28.792 line:82%
What have you decided?

763
01:10:32.542 --> 01:10:34.542 line:82%
I know it will be the biggest move
for my career.

764
01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:37.458 line:82%
But to shift to London is not easy for me.

765
01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:40.083 line:82%
I have to think of too many things.

766
01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:44.333 line:82%
Anyway, can we talk about this tomorrow?

767
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:43.792 line:82%
I want to die in your arms.

768
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.958 line:82%
Your ears.
Your forehead.

769
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:55.083 line:82%
Your nose, your cheeks.

770
01:11:56.667 --> 01:11:58.917 line:82%
Your lips... all of it is blue.

771
01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:08.083 line:82%
Dev. If this was a joke then it really
wasn't funny!

772
01:12:16.417 --> 01:12:19.417 line:82%
Maya, here I come. Best of luck.

773
01:13:55.208 --> 01:13:57.417 line:82%
So what if we failed the first time?
We'll try again.

774
01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.000 line:82%
Try what? Marriage?

775
01:13:59.792 --> 01:14:02.833 line:82%
Not marriage. We'll try again,
you know this book says.

776
01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:04.542 line:82%
What are these books
that you keep reading?

777
01:14:04.958 --> 01:14:09.167 line:82%
'Fighting for your marriage' bestseller
by Anna Marie Lou.

778
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.208 line:82%
You know, he knows a lot about marriages.

779
01:14:12.292 --> 01:14:14.792 line:82%
Of course she would.
She's married four times.

780
01:14:15.042 --> 01:14:17.833 line:82%
Anna Marie Lou is out to cheat you.

781
01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:21.750 line:82%
Watch it. Hey, one second.
Do you wanna fight for your marriage?

782
01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.500 line:82%
I'm not married. I'm gay!

783
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:24.958 line:82%
Good for you.

784
01:14:26.667 --> 01:14:29.292 line:82%
You know Dev,
I have one more superb plan--

785
01:14:29.375 --> 01:14:31.333 line:82%
It'll be far from superb.
It'll be a bullshit plan.

786
01:14:31.417 --> 01:14:32.250 line:82%
Don't you get tired?

787
01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:35.375 line:82%
I'm tired. Saving my marriage,
salvaging relationships.

788
01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:38.250 line:82%
I want a holiday from all that today.

789
01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:42.000 line:82%
I want to do something that I want to do.
There's a big football match today.

790
01:14:45.708 --> 01:14:46.625 line:82%
I want to see that.

791
01:14:47.833 --> 01:14:51.542 line:82%
I don't have tickets for the match
and probably won't get them,

792
01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:52.667 line:82%
yet I want to see it.

793
01:14:58.125 --> 01:14:58.958 line:82%
Will you come?

794
01:15:18.292 --> 01:15:22.708 line:82%
O my heart my beloved

795
01:15:31.333 --> 01:15:34.292 line:82%
Just whisper in my ear

796
01:15:35.875 --> 01:15:40.292 line:82%
Which way are you headed?

797
01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:43.167 line:82%
What is it that you yearn for?

798
01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:48.708 line:82%
What is it that you seek?

799
01:15:49.458 --> 01:15:54.042 line:82%
All desires unsaid
All dreams unfulfilled

800
01:15:54.125 --> 01:15:58.000 line:82%
Spell them all out now

801
01:15:58.083 --> 01:16:01.250 line:82%
My beloved

802
01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:06.000 line:82%
What does your heartbeat sing?

803
01:16:07.167 --> 01:16:08.792 line:82%
My beloved

804
01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:15.708 line:82%
Don't hide from your own dreams

805
01:16:25.419 --> 01:16:29.239 line:82%
Just whisper in my ear

806
01:16:29.799 --> 01:16:33.679 line:82%
Which way are you headed?

807
01:16:34.139 --> 01:16:38.279 line:82%
What is it that you yearn for?

808
01:16:38.639 --> 01:16:41.859 line:82%
What is it that you seek?

809
01:16:43.179 --> 01:16:47.699 line:82%
All desires unsaid
All dreams unfulfilled

810
01:16:47.919 --> 01:16:51.459 line:82%
Spell them all out now

811
01:16:51.999 --> 01:16:55.039 line:82%
My beloved

812
01:16:56.619 --> 01:17:00.619 line:82%
What does your heartbeat sing?

813
01:17:01.099 --> 01:17:05.279 line:82%
My beloved

814
01:17:05.559 --> 01:17:10.179 line:82%
Don't hide from your own dreams

815
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:38.500 line:82%
My beloved

816
01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:50.292 line:82%
On this path of life

817
01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:55.208 line:82%
On this path of love

818
01:17:55.299 --> 01:17:57.779 line:82%
On this path of life

819
01:17:57.879 --> 01:17:59.819 line:82%
On this path of love

820
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.375 line:82%
You have set eyes on someone special

821
01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:09.042 line:82%
You keep questioning
You keep thinking

822
01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:13.250 line:82%
Whether this is the one you pined for

823
01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:19.083 line:82%
Yes, this is the one
She is the one for you

824
01:18:20.292 --> 01:18:24.042 line:82%
You are a thirsty traveler
and she is the river

825
01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:28.292 line:82%
Why don't you accept it and say it to her

826
01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:33.292 line:82%
All desires unsaid
all dreams unfulfilled

827
01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.833 line:82%
Spell them all out now

828
01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:40.125 line:82%
My beloved

829
01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:45.750 line:82%
What does your heartbeat sing?

830
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:51.208 line:82%
My beloved

831
01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:53.875 line:82%
Don't hide from your own dreams

832
01:18:58.125 --> 01:19:03.125 line:82%
Dev do you know day after is both
our wedding anniversaries

833
01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:07.083 line:82%
So I think we should do something special
for Rishi and Rhea. What do you think?

834
01:19:07.667 --> 01:19:09.833 line:82%
Maybe we should leave them.
That will be pretty special.

835
01:19:13.292 --> 01:19:17.958 line:82%
Maya. Maya, we will do whatever you want
to do. Leave them!

836
01:19:23.083 --> 01:19:27.125 line:82%
Your eyes have found their destination.

837
01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:31.458 line:82%
But your feet hesitate to take the step.

838
01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:36.417 line:82%
When your life does a merry dance.

839
01:19:36.583 --> 01:19:40.667 line:82%
Why do you shackle your feet?

840
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:45.583 line:82%
Dance to the tune of love you fool.

841
01:19:47.458 --> 01:19:51.917 line:82%
Let caution fly to the winds.

842
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.125 line:82%
Why would you want to deprive your soul.

843
01:19:56.208 --> 01:20:00.375 line:82%
All desires unsaid.
All dreams unfulfilled.

844
01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:04.375 line:82%
Spell them all out now.

845
01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:07.375 line:82%
My beloved

846
01:20:09.417 --> 01:20:13.542 line:82%
What does your heartbeat sing?

847
01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:18.542 line:82%
My beloved

848
01:20:18.625 --> 01:20:22.833 line:82%
Don't hide from your own dreams

849
01:20:22.917 --> 01:20:26.833 line:82%
O my heart just whisper in my ear

850
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:31.417 line:82%
Which way are you headed?

851
01:20:31.958 --> 01:20:36.000 line:82%
What is it that you yearn for?

852
01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:41.083 line:82%
What is it that you seek?

853
01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:33.375 line:82%
I'll take it.

854
01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:35.167 line:82%
Thank you, Dev.

855
01:21:46.583 --> 01:21:49.542 line:82%
By the way, I want to tell you something.

856
01:21:50.875 --> 01:21:52.917 line:82%
The head office
has offered me a promotion,

857
01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.500 line:82%
they want me to shift to London.

858
01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:05.750 line:82%
-And this morning I decided that--
-That you will shift.

859
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.333 line:82%
And of course there was no need
to consult me.

860
01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:15.208 line:82%
After all who am I? I'm just your husband?

861
01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:17.583 line:82%
What status do I have?

862
01:22:17.958 --> 01:22:21.833 line:82%
I'm just here to applaud for your success.

863
01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:30.625 line:82%
This one decision of yours
can change all our lives.

864
01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:32.917 line:82%
But why would you think of that?

865
01:22:33.042 --> 01:22:36.250 line:82%
Because, Rhea Saran only thinks
about herself.

866
01:22:36.333 --> 01:22:41.708 line:82%
Her rocking career, her success,
her happiness.

867
01:22:51.542 --> 01:22:54.792 line:82%
I was just going to tell you that
I have refused the promotion.

868
01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:59.125 line:82%
After thinking about you, this family.
But where do you listen?

869
01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:03.083 line:82%
If you refused the promotion
what was the need to tell me?

870
01:23:03.958 --> 01:23:05.083 line:82%
Trying to show off your magnanimity?

871
01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:08.625 line:82%
I wasn't showing off, Dev.
I was baring my heart.

872
01:23:08.708 --> 01:23:13.375 line:82%
Do you have a heart, Rhea? What heart?

873
01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:15.839 line:82%
Arjun!

874
01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:21.750 line:82%
Arjun, stop that noise.

875
01:23:21.839 --> 01:23:24.399 line:82%
This is no time to play the violin.
It's time for you to sleep.

876
01:23:30.292 --> 01:23:32.500 line:82%
Arjun! Arjun!

877
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.042 line:82%
Why are you venting your anger on him?
What has he done?

878
01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:39.208 line:82%
Don't you dare tell me how I should
behave with Arjun, Rhea.

879
01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:43.083 line:82%
I have brought him up.

880
01:23:43.375 --> 01:23:46.750 line:82%
Only l...
You had no time from your work.

881
01:23:47.625 --> 01:23:49.708 line:82%
Did you ever have time for him? Did you?

882
01:23:49.917 --> 01:23:52.250 line:82%
Yes Dev, I didn't have time.

883
01:23:55.333 --> 01:23:58.083 line:82%
No one asks men when they are busy.

884
01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:00.875 line:82%
When they have no time for their children.

885
01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:03.125 line:82%
Then why are you asking me?

886
01:24:03.583 --> 01:24:05.625 line:82%
Tell me Dev, how can you ask me?

887
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.917 line:82%
Because the truth is,
that I'm the man in this house.

888
01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:19.500 line:82%
I couldn't be Arjun's mother
because I had to be his father.

889
01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:22.333 line:82%
So that he could have all the happiness

890
01:24:22.417 --> 01:24:24.083 line:82%
that a football coach cannot afford
to give him.

891
01:24:26.208 --> 01:24:29.708 line:82%
How did that sound, Dev?
It hurts, doesn't it?

892
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:36.542 line:82%
You have only hurt me, Dev.

893
01:24:38.292 --> 01:24:41.917 line:82%
I always thought you hurt those
you love the most.

894
01:24:43.292 --> 01:24:47.375 line:82%
But that's not true.
You don't love me at all.

895
01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:52.750 line:82%
You don't love anyone.
You only hate.

896
01:24:53.417 --> 01:24:57.500 line:82%
You hate yourself,
your life and your failure.

897
01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:09.208 line:82%
And I haven't been able to figure out
what angers you more.

898
01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:14.042 line:82%
Your failure or my success.

899
01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:24.333 line:82%
I'm a failure. That's true.

900
01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:31.292 line:82%
But do you know, there's a greater
failure than me in this house?

901
01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:35.459 line:82%
Our relationship.

902
01:25:40.208 --> 01:25:41.500 line:82%
Our marriage.

903
01:26:51.667 --> 01:26:53.125 line:82%
Why are you so angry, Rishi?

904
01:26:53.958 --> 01:26:56.000 line:82%
What's the big deal
if I didn't feel like it one night?

905
01:26:56.292 --> 01:26:57.625 line:82%
Come on, don't behave like a child.

906
01:27:02.208 --> 01:27:03.625 line:82%
I have heard enough.

907
01:27:06.417 --> 01:27:11.667 line:82%
Maya, do you remember the last time
we were intimate with each other?

908
01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:17.000 line:82%
When, Maya?
When did we touch each other?

909
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:19.792 line:82%
Held hands or embraced? Anything?
Do you remember?

910
01:27:21.208 --> 01:27:23.917 line:82%
When did we not turn our backs to each
other in bed? Do you remember?

911
01:27:25.375 --> 01:27:26.417 line:82%
I don't remember...

912
01:27:26.833 --> 01:27:28.250 line:82%
You don't remember
or don't want to remember.

913
01:27:29.625 --> 01:27:32.792 line:82%
Why? I thought you like discussions.

914
01:27:39.917 --> 01:27:42.625 line:82%
Our relationship cannot grow just
by sleeping with each other, Rishi.

915
01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:46.042 line:82%
It can only grow when we embrace
each other's sorrow and happiness.

916
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:49.167 line:82%
And when was the last time
we did that? When, Rishi?

917
01:27:50.083 --> 01:27:53.208 line:82%
A husband and wife don't just share a bed.
They share their lives.

918
01:27:57.667 --> 01:28:00.917 line:82%
Do you think I'm the kind of man who only
feels the need for his wife in his bed?

919
01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.875 line:82%
To embrace each other's happiness and pain
one has to embrace each other.

920
01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:08.625 line:82%
And you have never felt that way about me.

921
01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:10.417 line:82%
'You are a child, you are a child,
you are a child'

922
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.792 line:82%
I'm fed up of hearing that.

923
01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:15.625 line:82%
If I was truly a child,
I'd have broken down long ago.

924
01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.958 line:82%
I tolerate you because I'm a man.

925
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.625 line:82%
Today you cannot leave like this.

926
01:28:26.125 --> 01:28:27.667 line:82%
You will have to tell me today.

927
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:31.833 line:82%
The truth.
Tell me, why did you marry me?

928
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.875 line:82%
Why?
I married you because I love you.

929
01:28:39.792 --> 01:28:44.458 line:82%
I love you very much.
But why did you marry me, Maya?

930
01:28:46.792 --> 01:28:49.917 line:82%
Tell me. Why did you marry me?

931
01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:09.125 line:82%
The truth, Maya,
is that you never married me.

932
01:29:11.083 --> 01:29:12.399 line:82%
You compromised.

933
01:29:16.667 --> 01:29:19.250 line:82%
I'm your life's biggest compromise.

934
01:29:22.917 --> 01:29:26.708 line:82%
A compromise that you regret
every day of your life, right?

935
01:29:29.792 --> 01:29:32.500 line:82%
That's the truth, right?

936
01:29:34.779 --> 01:29:35.719 line:82%
Give me an answer.

937
01:29:38.708 --> 01:29:39.739 line:82%
What answer?

938
01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:46.458 line:82%
You have nothing to give.
Nothing at all.

939
01:29:47.458 --> 01:29:49.958 line:82%
Not love, not happiness,
not affection.

940
01:29:50.042 --> 01:29:51.875 line:82%
You haven't even been able
to give me a child.

941
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:59.833 line:82%
And Maya, I have never made you feel
inadequate about that. Never.

942
01:30:12.458 --> 01:30:13.458 line:82%
You just did.

943
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.219 line:82%
Just did it, Rishi.

944
01:31:10.125 --> 01:31:13.333 line:82%
Four years ago, you said that everlasting
romances don't exist anymore.

945
01:31:13.625 --> 01:31:14.542 line:82%
Remember, Dev?

946
01:31:15.417 --> 01:31:16.750 line:82%
Will you say the same even now?

947
01:31:17.583 --> 01:31:19.208 line:82%
Four years ago, you said that

948
01:31:19.917 --> 01:31:22.375 line:82%
if I don't look for love after marriage,
I won't find it

949
01:31:23.292 --> 01:31:24.333 line:82%
What will you say now, Dev?

950
01:31:24.875 --> 01:31:25.958 line:82%
What will you say?

951
01:31:26.167 --> 01:31:27.125 line:82%
Answer me...

952
01:31:27.417 --> 01:31:29.833 line:82%
What are you and me doing at the station
in the middle of the night?

953
01:31:30.708 --> 01:31:31.583 line:82%
What are we doing, Dev?

954
01:31:31.833 --> 01:31:33.833 line:82%
Answer me.
I need answers to all these questions.

955
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:35.958 line:82%
Where are you going, Dev?

956
01:31:37.875 --> 01:31:39.375 line:82%
Answer me!
Answer me, Dev!

957
01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:46.750 line:82%
18th March 2002.
You met me for the first time, Maya.

958
01:31:49.042 --> 01:31:51.500 line:82%
Since that day I have felt like
I have known you forever.

959
01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:53.167 line:82%
ls this the answer to your question?

960
01:31:56.083 --> 01:31:59.083 line:82%
Everyday your train leaves the station
at 4:32.

961
01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:03.125 line:82%
and mine at 4:21.
Everyday I miss my train

962
01:32:03.708 --> 01:32:06.333 line:82%
so that I can spend some more moments
with you.

963
01:32:06.458 --> 01:32:07.875 line:82%
Is this the answer to your question?

964
01:32:08.833 --> 01:32:12.708 line:82%
Everyday I leave you at the station but
your thoughts don't leave me.

965
01:32:14.417 --> 01:32:16.042 line:82%
ls this the answer to your question?

966
01:32:17.917 --> 01:32:20.000 line:82%
Maybe you've forgotten that you are, too.

967
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:21.875 line:82%
Since both of us are married,

968
01:32:21.958 --> 01:32:24.958 line:82%
what are we doing at the station
in the middle of the night?

969
01:32:29.625 --> 01:32:32.542 line:82%
That's the answer to your question, right?
listen to the answer.

970
01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:11.500 line:82%
You are Dev's mother,
you will take his side.

971
01:33:11.583 --> 01:33:13.583 line:82%
I'm a woman before I'm a mother, Rhea.

972
01:33:13.958 --> 01:33:18.458 line:82%
And I know you are right. Nothing will
happen just because I think it is.

973
01:33:18.833 --> 01:33:20.208 line:82%
The situation is not going to change.

974
01:33:20.667 --> 01:33:22.708 line:82%
Things will only change when Dev changes.

975
01:33:26.042 --> 01:33:28.417 line:82%
Mom, please I'm tired.

976
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.083 line:82%
I've tried enough to understand him,
to get closer to him.

977
01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:36.833 line:82%
One fine day, he just decided to step back
from the relationship.

978
01:33:37.167 --> 01:33:41.250 line:82%
He did not step back, Rhea.
You raced ahead.

979
01:33:41.917 --> 01:33:43.458 line:82%
You have to wait for him.

980
01:33:43.792 --> 01:33:46.958 line:82%
Why? Why is a woman always expected
to wait.

981
01:33:47.625 --> 01:33:53.125 line:82%
Because they are stronger.
And have you thought about Arjun?

982
01:33:53.417 --> 01:33:55.292 line:82%
I'm not the kind of woman,

983
01:33:55.417 --> 01:33:57.500 line:82%
who will use her child
as an excuse to back down.

984
01:33:57.708 --> 01:33:59.208 line:82%
I'm not that weak.

985
01:33:59.542 --> 01:34:02.792 line:82%
You are not weak.
Your relationship is.

986
01:34:03.042 --> 01:34:05.583 line:82%
You have to give it strength.
You have to give it time.

987
01:34:05.917 --> 01:34:10.542 line:82%
I will give this relationship nothing,
till Dev gives it love.

988
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:18.042 line:82%
You are going somewhere?

989
01:34:19.167 --> 01:34:23.542 line:82%
Paris. For ten days.
To organize a few events.

990
01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.250 line:82%
Last night the things you said to her--

991
01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:29.000 line:82%
Last night I said a lot of things
I shouldn't have,

992
01:34:29.875 --> 01:34:33.042 line:82%
and a few that were very important to say.

993
01:34:34.958 --> 01:34:36.250 line:82%
Try to understand her, Rishi.

994
01:34:39.458 --> 01:34:43.000 line:82%
How do I understand a heart that
has no place for me?

995
01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:48.042 line:82%
That's not true, Rishi.
She loves you a lot.

996
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:54.875 line:82%
Look into her eyes.
Who else can all that love be for?

997
01:34:55.083 --> 01:34:58.917 line:82%
I wish the love in her eyes reached
her lips once in a while.

998
01:34:59.292 --> 01:35:03.458 line:82%
Dad, everyday I tell her how much
I love her, has she ever said it?

999
01:35:06.917 --> 01:35:09.208 line:82%
Sorry, dad. I can't take it.

1000
01:35:13.419 --> 01:35:14.500 line:82%
Not anymore.

1001
01:35:32.125 --> 01:35:32.958 line:82%
Now?

1002
01:35:36.542 --> 01:35:37.583 line:82%
Now what, Dev?

1003
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.375 line:82%
It was important to say
that we love each other.

1004
01:35:47.542 --> 01:35:48.750 line:82%
So, we've said it.

1005
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.125 line:82%
And what did we gain by saying it?

1006
01:35:52.625 --> 01:35:53.779 line:82%
I don't know.

1007
01:35:56.125 --> 01:36:00.542 line:82%
But if we hadn't,
we would have lost something.

1008
01:36:05.167 --> 01:36:09.208 line:82%
You know Dev, that this
relationship has no future.

1009
01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:20.083 line:82%
That's why it needs to be abandoned
on this beautiful note.

1010
01:36:43.125 --> 01:36:44.250 line:82%
Your train.

1011
01:36:48.083 --> 01:36:49.375 line:82%
Not my train anymore.

1012
01:36:51.542 --> 01:36:54.875 line:82%
I'm planning to stop traveling by train.

1013
01:38:08.333 --> 01:38:12.542 line:82%
Your life is empty.
I can see it in your eyes.

1014
01:38:14.667 --> 01:38:16.958 line:82%
Do you remember
when we touched each other?

1015
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:19.583 line:82%
Held hands? Anything? Do you remember?

1016
01:38:20.208 --> 01:38:24.417 line:82%
I leave you at the station everyday
but your thoughts never leave me.

1017
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:28.167 line:82%
To embrace each other's happiness
and pain, one has to embrace each other.

1018
01:38:28.333 --> 01:38:30.167 line:82%
And you have never felt
that way about me.

1019
01:38:30.333 --> 01:38:31.458 line:82%
Since both of us are married

1020
01:38:31.542 --> 01:38:34.833 line:82%
what are we doing at the station
in the middle of the night?

1021
01:38:35.167 --> 01:38:40.167 line:82%
You have to tell me today, Maya.
Tell me the truth, why did you marry me?

1022
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:41.625 line:82%
Why?

1023
01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:44.667 line:82%
Sometimes friendship takes
the place of love.

1024
01:38:45.458 --> 01:38:47.542 line:82%
and then there's no place left for love.

1025
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.542 line:82%
The truth is, that you never married me,

1026
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.542 line:82%
You compromised.

1027
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:58.375 line:82%
Listen to the answer, Maya.

1028
01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:11.917 line:82%
And what if I find my soul mate
after marriage?

1029
01:39:39.333 --> 01:39:40.417 line:82%
Dev!

1030
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:41.833 line:82%
Do you know when we reached here?

1031
01:40:43.458 --> 01:40:48.250 line:82%
I am yours and you mine

1032
01:40:48.583 --> 01:40:54.500 line:82%
I'm wonder struck at this moment.
What can I say to you?

1033
01:40:55.292 --> 01:41:00.208 line:82%
When moonlight has emerged in
the middle of the day

1034
01:41:00.667 --> 01:41:06.458 line:82%
It seems awake yet it's dreaming

1035
01:41:07.542 --> 01:41:11.958 line:82%
My lovelorn life

1036
01:42:06.125 --> 01:42:11.750 line:82%
Intoxicated souls
Musky bodies

1037
01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:16.375 line:82%
There's a pureness in the air

1038
01:42:18.083 --> 01:42:23.625 line:82%
In this moment that we are in
there's so much color

1039
01:42:23.958 --> 01:42:29.375 line:82%
Spilling out of our eyes

1040
01:42:29.667 --> 01:42:35.667 line:82%
The blue sky showers on us

1041
01:42:36.417 --> 01:42:41.125 line:82%
Soft silky rays of light

1042
01:42:41.279 --> 01:42:47.179 line:82%
Do you know when we reached here?

1043
01:42:47.833 --> 01:42:52.833 line:82%
I am yours and you mine

1044
01:42:52.999 --> 01:42:58.599 line:82%
I'm wonder struck at this moment.
What can I say to you?

1045
01:42:59.799 --> 01:43:03.879 line:82%
When moonlight has emerged in
the middle of the day

1046
01:43:35.083 --> 01:43:40.792 line:82%
I was blissfully ignorant

1047
01:43:41.042 --> 01:43:45.875 line:82%
Of this love that flows forth unbridled

1048
01:43:47.167 --> 01:43:52.875 line:82%
True is this feeling
This feeling is called love

1049
01:43:52.958 --> 01:43:58.083 line:82%
All else is just an illusion

1050
01:43:58.708 --> 01:44:04.708 line:82%
My heart slowly hums

1051
01:44:05.167 --> 01:44:10.208 line:82%
The melodious notes of love

1052
01:44:10.292 --> 01:44:15.958 line:82%
Do you know when we reached here?

1053
01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:21.500 line:82%
I am yours and you mine

1054
01:44:21.917 --> 01:44:27.917 line:82%
I'm wonder struck at this moment
What can I say to you?

1055
01:44:28.625 --> 01:44:33.917 line:82%
When moonlight has emerged
in the middle of the day

1056
01:44:34.125 --> 01:44:40.125 line:82%
It seems awake yet it's dreaming

1057
01:44:40.875 --> 01:44:44.833 line:82%
My lovelorn life

1058
01:45:16.333 --> 01:45:19.999 line:82%
We were crazy. We were strange.
We were different.

1059
01:45:20.199 --> 01:45:24.708 line:82%
Very different. Incomplete on our own
but so complete together.

1060
01:45:25.583 --> 01:45:30.333 line:82%
We were not walking on the ground.
There, we had slipped long ago.

1061
01:45:30.708 --> 01:45:34.208 line:82%
We were flying in the sky.
Talking to the clouds.

1062
01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:38.875 line:82%
We didn't have a care in the world.
We had made our own world.

1063
01:45:39.125 --> 01:45:42.750 line:82%
Our world. Maya and Dev's world.

1064
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.333 line:82%
The world of our dreams.

1065
01:45:55.708 --> 01:46:00.667 line:82%
But then dreams always leave
when you wake up to reality.

1066
01:46:02.875 --> 01:46:04.875 line:82%
Come on, drink your milk quickly.

1067
01:46:05.167 --> 01:46:07.208 line:82%
-I don't want to drink it.
-Drink it.

1068
01:46:17.458 --> 01:46:20.000 line:82%
I was going to ask you for advice
and I come to know.

1069
01:46:20.083 --> 01:46:22.583 line:82%
that it's the same situation
in your house, too.

1070
01:46:23.833 --> 01:46:25.625 line:82%
Every house seems to have the same story.

1071
01:46:26.708 --> 01:46:28.417 line:82%
Will you stop this TV soap commentary?

1072
01:46:32.250 --> 01:46:34.333 line:82%
Look, your son is mule headed.

1073
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:35.917 line:82%
He is not going to do anything.

1074
01:46:36.458 --> 01:46:38.667 line:82%
Maya isn't at fault so she
isn't going to do anything.

1075
01:46:44.083 --> 01:46:46.917 line:82%
Whatever needs to be done
has to be done by Rhea and Rishi.

1076
01:46:50.083 --> 01:46:51.667 line:82%
Who will convince them?

1077
01:46:52.292 --> 01:46:53.917 line:82%
What if they convince each other?

1078
01:46:54.292 --> 01:46:56.042 line:82%
And why will they do that?

1079
01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.125 line:82%
Two strangers, same situation.

1080
01:47:01.333 --> 01:47:04.792 line:82%
Then, friendship and problem solved.
Remember?

1081
01:47:05.667 --> 01:47:08.000 line:82%
But how will they meet each other?

1082
01:47:10.167 --> 01:47:11.208 line:82%
Dad, what are we doing here?

1083
01:47:11.333 --> 01:47:13.125 line:82%
I haven't bought you a present
in a long time.

1084
01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:14.375 line:82%
So I thought I'd do that today.

1085
01:47:17.375 --> 01:47:18.708 line:82%
It's for kids.

1086
01:47:20.292 --> 01:47:23.208 line:82%
But to me you will always be a kid.

1087
01:47:23.375 --> 01:47:25.875 line:82%
Mom, should I take this for Arjun?

1088
01:47:26.167 --> 01:47:29.042 line:82%
Yes, take it. It's very nice.
It's fantastic.

1089
01:47:29.125 --> 01:47:31.458 line:82%
You have very good taste.
It's a fabulous dog, take it.

1090
01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:38.159 line:82%
OK, I'll take this.

1091
01:47:38.667 --> 01:47:41.417 line:82%
God! What an awful red dog.
Just leave it.

1092
01:47:47.792 --> 01:47:50.375 line:82%
Of all the places in New York
we had to meet here.

1093
01:47:55.417 --> 01:47:57.042 line:82%
By the way what are you doing here?

1094
01:47:57.208 --> 01:48:00.125 line:82%
We had come here to buy
a soft toy for my grandson

1095
01:48:00.375 --> 01:48:02.417 line:82%
which he can cuddle to at night.

1096
01:48:02.708 --> 01:48:07.375 line:82%
Even I was looking for something
like that. And I saw you.

1097
01:48:07.833 --> 01:48:12.375 line:82%
Neither am I soft nor am I a toy.
So please stay away.

1098
01:48:20.875 --> 01:48:25.542 line:82%
There are so many beautiful
things here. Red, blue, green...

1099
01:48:34.458 --> 01:48:36.167 line:82%
Don't you think that was weird behavior?

1100
01:48:45.458 --> 01:48:46.500 line:82%
Where are you heading?

1101
01:49:04.625 --> 01:49:06.458 line:82%
Why are people so happy in New York?

1102
01:49:06.708 --> 01:49:09.208 line:82%
Because they are not married. That's why.

1103
01:49:15.625 --> 01:49:17.125 line:82%
They go home, take a shower
and freshen themselves.

1104
01:49:17.333 --> 01:49:18.167 line:82%
Watch TV.

1105
01:49:21.542 --> 01:49:23.750 line:82%
True. We go home to a sour face.

1106
01:49:23.958 --> 01:49:26.083 line:82%
That likes nothing. That likes no one.

1107
01:49:26.167 --> 01:49:27.542 line:82%
Not even us.

1108
01:49:31.042 --> 01:49:33.292 line:82%
-But have they ever complimented us?
-Never!

1109
01:49:33.542 --> 01:49:35.333 line:82%
All the time whine, whine, whine.

1110
01:49:39.375 --> 01:49:40.417 line:82%
My God, how they trouble us.

1111
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:41.333 line:82%
How they sadden us.

1112
01:49:41.417 --> 01:49:43.458 line:82%
-Mock us.
-Hurt us.

1113
01:49:43.667 --> 01:49:44.542 line:82%
Why did we marry?

1114
01:49:44.958 --> 01:49:47.250 line:82%
I know.
Our brains were not working.

1115
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000 line:82%
You know what? We should be single.

1116
01:50:06.708 --> 01:50:09.083 line:82%
-We are lying.
-What?

1117
01:50:16.792 --> 01:50:19.917 line:82%
You have called me five times
since morning. What's the problem?

1118
01:50:20.125 --> 01:50:22.083 line:82%
The problem is that
my work is that kind.

1119
01:50:22.875 --> 01:50:26.167 line:82%
I never have the time
to express my feeling.

1120
01:50:26.333 --> 01:50:28.417 line:82%
And I keep expressing
my feelings all the time.

1121
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:30.417 line:82%
So what's stopping you today?

1122
01:50:34.458 --> 01:50:36.583 line:82%
Nothing's stopping you either.

1123
01:50:36.792 --> 01:50:38.167 line:82%
Do you like diamonds, Maya?

1124
01:50:39.375 --> 01:50:41.500 line:82%
Large, beautiful and expensive diamonds.

1125
01:50:43.958 --> 01:50:45.458 line:82%
Tell your husband to buy them for you.

1126
01:50:47.875 --> 01:50:49.750 line:82%
I have bought you flowers.

1127
01:50:54.792 --> 01:50:59.083 line:82%
OK, I'll call him if you speak to Maya.

1128
01:50:59.167 --> 01:51:02.125 line:82%
Why should I speak any longer?
I'm meeting you in five minutes.

1129
01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.458 line:82%
Then speak to me
for four and a half minute.

1130
01:51:16.167 --> 01:51:19.792 line:82%
Maya, I'm sulking
and you aren't even trying to make up.

1131
01:51:23.792 --> 01:51:27.500 line:82%
Say or do something which
shows that you are mine.

1132
01:51:28.292 --> 01:51:29.458 line:82%
Only mine.

1133
01:51:38.542 --> 01:51:39.625 line:82%
It's gone too far.

1134
01:51:39.708 --> 01:51:41.083 line:82%
I don't want to fight anymore.

1135
01:51:41.417 --> 01:51:45.208 line:82%
If you want the same then show me a sign.

1136
01:51:45.583 --> 01:51:47.625 line:82%
Just a sign.

1137
01:54:13.167 --> 01:54:15.042 line:82%
Dev. You? Here?

1138
01:54:15.542 --> 01:54:18.667 line:82%
Yeah, I...
just got out of the station.

1139
01:54:19.333 --> 01:54:21.708 line:82%
And these flowers?

1140
01:54:28.792 --> 01:54:29.667 line:82%
For you.

1141
01:55:57.583 --> 01:55:59.333 line:82%
Flowers have their own language

1142
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.083 line:82%
they say so much silently. Right?

1143
01:56:19.375 --> 01:56:22.917 line:82%
I asked for just one sign.
And got so many.

1144
01:56:41.958 --> 01:56:43.625 line:82%
Where's Arjun?

1145
01:56:44.917 --> 01:56:46.542 line:82%
He must have gone to his violin class.
Right?

1146
01:56:48.417 --> 01:56:50.000 line:82%
He's quit the violin.

1147
01:56:50.958 --> 01:56:54.042 line:82%
Quit violin? Why?

1148
01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:59.333 line:82%
He thinks his violin
is the reason for our fights.

1149
01:57:25.875 --> 01:57:27.833 line:82%
What an idiot I have given birth to?

1150
01:57:34.875 --> 01:57:36.500 line:82%
There's no reason to say sorry.

1151
01:57:37.125 --> 01:57:38.333 line:82%
There's no reason to quit violin

1152
01:57:38.417 --> 01:57:39.625 line:82%
and there is absolutely
no reason to play football.

1153
01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.833 line:82%
Anyone can play the football.

1154
01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:52.750 line:82%
Even I can.

1155
01:58:09.167 --> 01:58:11.292 line:82%
You can play violin as much
as you want from today.

1156
01:58:12.042 --> 01:58:14.708 line:82%
Play it day and night.
I won't say anything.

1157
01:58:20.875 --> 01:58:25.917 line:82%
Because now I have this.

1158
01:58:47.875 --> 01:58:50.375 line:82%
We will make an eleven member team.

1159
01:58:50.667 --> 01:58:52.458 line:82%
You play the violin
in the forward position.

1160
01:58:52.542 --> 01:58:53.875 line:82%
Violin doesn't have a forward.

1161
01:58:55.542 --> 01:58:59.375 line:82%
And our band will be called
Manchester United Philharmonic.

1162
01:59:31.208 --> 01:59:32.417 line:82%
Rishi, all this.

1163
01:59:40.667 --> 01:59:42.208 line:82%
I cleaned the entire house.

1164
01:59:42.708 --> 01:59:47.875 line:82%
It took three hours.
The food's ready, really.

1165
01:59:48.708 --> 01:59:51.917 line:82%
With these very hands I phoned
and called for food.

1166
01:59:58.708 --> 01:59:59.667 line:82%
This whole weekend.

1167
02:00:02.083 --> 02:00:05.417 line:82%
You and me.
All day and all night.

1168
02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:12.333 line:82%
For hours, with each other...

1169
02:00:13.917 --> 02:00:17.917 line:82%
discuss things.
Whatever you want we shall discuss.

1170
02:00:23.958 --> 02:00:24.917 line:82%
For that night.

1171
02:00:28.417 --> 02:00:30.458 line:82%
Sometimes you make mistakes in love.

1172
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.478 line:82%
Who are you talking to?

1173
02:01:01.958 --> 02:01:04.375 line:82%
Sorry, I couldn't take your calls.

1174
02:01:04.542 --> 02:01:06.417 line:82%
-Rishi was with me the whole weekend--
-Don't worry. It's alright.

1175
02:01:06.667 --> 02:01:08.125 line:82%
I tried only once.

1176
02:01:09.292 --> 02:01:11.125 line:82%
But I got 15 missed calls.

1177
02:01:11.458 --> 02:01:13.375 line:82%
The numbers get dialed accidentally.

1178
02:01:14.333 --> 02:01:15.458 line:82%
How was the weekend?

1179
02:01:15.833 --> 02:01:19.292 line:82%
Very good.
I spent a lot of time with Rhea and Arjun.

1180
02:01:19.375 --> 02:01:20.458 line:82%
It was fun.

1181
02:01:25.083 --> 02:01:27.708 line:82%
We even went shopping.
Rhea bought a lovely dress.

1182
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:33.333 line:82%
-Rhea looked very good in it.
-Rhea is very beautiful.

1183
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:37.250 line:82%
She looks good in anything she wears.
So what did you do today?

1184
02:01:37.583 --> 02:01:38.625 line:82%
Same as every day.

1185
02:01:38.792 --> 02:01:42.750 line:82%
I had lunch with George Bush
and now I'm off for coffee with Madonna.

1186
02:01:45.208 --> 02:01:48.833 line:82%
I don't know what your problem is
but I don't want to fight with you.

1187
02:01:49.083 --> 02:01:50.792 line:82%
Anyway, I'm going out with Rishi.

1188
02:01:52.458 --> 02:01:53.583 line:82%
There seems to be a sudden
love for Rishi?

1189
02:01:58.208 --> 02:02:00.718 line:82%
So, Rishi is taking you to meet
the rest of his family at the zoo?

1190
02:02:00.778 --> 02:02:02.792 line:82%
Rishi is taking me to the ballet...

1191
02:02:03.292 --> 02:02:06.167 line:82%
Ballet? Where men dance without underwear?
Rishi likes all that stuff?

1192
02:02:06.250 --> 02:02:07.958 line:82%
Not Rishi, I like ballet.

1193
02:02:11.958 --> 02:02:13.542 line:82%
You like strange things.

1194
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:16.250 line:82%
Yeah, nothing
can be more strange than you.

1195
02:02:22.708 --> 02:02:25.083 line:82%
-Dev, I hope you are well.
-I am. Why?

1196
02:02:25.375 --> 02:02:26.750 line:82%
First the flowers, now the ballet.

1197
02:02:45.375 --> 02:02:49.750 line:82%
Hey, Rhea.
Are you following me?

1198
02:02:51.667 --> 02:02:53.583 line:82%
But I'm following your wife for sure.

1199
02:03:02.292 --> 02:03:04.167 line:82%
So even you have come here
to appease your wife?

1200
02:03:21.292 --> 02:03:22.667 line:82%
It's Dev's choice.

1201
02:03:24.583 --> 02:03:28.500 line:82%
You look beautiful, too.
But a little less than Rhea.

1202
02:03:30.542 --> 02:03:33.292 line:82%
Just the way you look a little less
handsome than Rishi.

1203
02:03:41.417 --> 02:03:43.333 line:82%
Dev, you need to be
taken to the doctor tomorrow for sure.

1204
02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:34.958 line:82%
What were we doing?
What were we doing last night?

1205
02:06:35.917 --> 02:06:37.917 line:82%
We were playing with their feelings.

1206
02:06:39.292 --> 02:06:41.792 line:82%
For the first time I felt hatred
for myself.

1207
02:06:42.458 --> 02:06:43.667 line:82%
How could I do this to Rishi?

1208
02:06:43.958 --> 02:06:45.542 line:82%
Feeling bad for him?

1209
02:06:45.792 --> 02:06:47.208 line:82%
You must have felt guilty last night, too.

1210
02:06:48.083 --> 02:06:50.375 line:82%
So what did you do
to get rid of your guilt?

1211
02:06:51.583 --> 02:06:55.167 line:82%
What did you do?
Did you allow him to touch you?

1212
02:07:01.667 --> 02:07:06.167 line:82%
Did he touch you here?
Here, here. Tell me?

1213
02:07:07.375 --> 02:07:08.958 line:82%
You think I don't feel bad?

1214
02:07:09.250 --> 02:07:12.625 line:82%
That my love spends nights with
someone else? But I bear it.

1215
02:07:12.708 --> 02:07:16.208 line:82%
I can't bear it... I can't bear it.

1216
02:07:16.458 --> 02:07:20.167 line:82%
You will have to.
Because our relationship is a dream

1217
02:07:20.583 --> 02:07:23.750 line:82%
That shatters every time we reach home.
And that's the truth.

1218
02:07:23.875 --> 02:07:29.125 line:82%
No, I can't accept this truth.
I can't bear.

1219
02:07:29.833 --> 02:07:33.083 line:82%
I can't bear it.
I can't bear to see you.

1220
02:07:34.333 --> 02:07:37.500 line:82%
You are mine. Just mine.

1221
02:07:38.208 --> 02:07:40.375 line:82%
Then how come he has a greater right.

1222
02:07:41.417 --> 02:07:43.917 line:82%
Your heart is mine but you have his name.

1223
02:07:44.583 --> 02:07:48.292 line:82%
I can't bear it. You are mine.

1224
02:07:48.375 --> 02:07:49.833 line:82%
Dev, what are you doing?

1225
02:08:10.292 --> 02:08:11.958 line:82%
Marriage is a beautiful relationship.

1226
02:08:12.792 --> 02:08:16.125 line:82%
It gives you that special someone
who you trust more than yourself.

1227
02:08:59.875 --> 02:09:02.042 line:82%
Rishi, I don't know who's following whom.

1228
02:09:06.292 --> 02:09:08.917 line:82%
But only you and me know
the real reason why we are celebrating.

1229
02:09:36.667 --> 02:09:39.917 line:82%
Dance all night
Wanna dance all night?

1230
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000 line:82%
Do you feel alright?
Wanna dance all night

1231
02:10:06.083 --> 02:10:08.718 line:82%
Dance all night
Wanna dance all night?

1232
02:10:08.878 --> 02:10:12.500 line:82%
Do you feel alright?
Wanna dance all night

1233
02:10:27.917 --> 02:10:31.375 line:82%
Beautiful moments

1234
02:10:31.458 --> 02:10:34.792 line:82%
Beautiful talks

1235
02:10:35.125 --> 02:10:38.583 line:82%
Weaving these dreamy days

1236
02:10:38.833 --> 02:10:42.042 line:82%
And dreamy nights

1237
02:10:42.125 --> 02:10:45.583 line:82%
Melody of the heart echoes

1238
02:10:46.042 --> 02:10:49.417 line:82%
The breezy song of the soul

1239
02:10:49.792 --> 02:10:52.708 line:82%
And all the loved ones sway to the tune

1240
02:10:52.792 --> 02:10:56.417 line:82%
So let's dance all night

1241
02:12:09.625 --> 02:12:11.417 line:82%
The one I dreamt of

1242
02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:13.375 line:82%
The one who drove me crazy

1243
02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:16.667 line:82%
Today he is mine

1244
02:12:16.958 --> 02:12:18.708 line:82%
Like the flower that I yearned for

1245
02:12:18.792 --> 02:12:20.542 line:82%
Like the fragrance that I craved for

1246
02:12:20.625 --> 02:12:23.833 line:82%
She has blossomed in my arms

1247
02:12:24.292 --> 02:12:27.750 line:82%
The path is filled with fragrance of love

1248
02:12:27.833 --> 02:12:31.250 line:82%
Intoxicated are all eyes around

1249
02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:34.625 line:82%
Dreams weave a web around all of us

1250
02:12:34.708 --> 02:12:38.167 line:82%
So let's dance all night

1251
02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.292 line:82%
Dance all night

1252
02:13:22.625 --> 02:13:23.917 line:82%
My story goes like this

1253
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.792 line:82%
The one who I yearn for

1254
02:13:25.875 --> 02:13:29.333 line:82%
Has fallen for me

1255
02:13:29.667 --> 02:13:31.458 line:82%
The queen of my heart

1256
02:13:31.542 --> 02:13:35.833 line:82%
Has my story on her lips

1257
02:13:36.625 --> 02:13:40.375 line:82%
Happy ending is in sight

1258
02:13:40.458 --> 02:13:44.042 line:82%
I have got a sign

1259
02:13:44.125 --> 02:13:47.417 line:82%
Life dances in mirth

1260
02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:50.750 line:82%
So let's dance all night

1261
02:13:58.625 --> 02:14:00.708 line:82%
Weaving these dreamy days

1262
02:14:00.792 --> 02:14:02.417 line:82%
And dreamy nights

1263
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000 line:82%
Who's house is this?

1264
02:15:55.083 --> 02:15:57.167 line:82%
You know Kamaljit,
it's her birthday today.

1265
02:15:57.250 --> 02:15:58.750 line:82%
So I thought I'd invite her for dinner.

1266
02:15:58.833 --> 02:16:00.667 line:82%
If you are with me she will
take me more seriously.

1267
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:01.583 line:82%
Kamaljit?

1268
02:16:01.708 --> 02:16:05.458 line:82%
Kamaljit. That...

1269
02:16:06.083 --> 02:16:07.833 line:82%
Dev's mother.

1270
02:16:11.458 --> 02:16:13.333 line:82%
Rhea... Who is it?

1271
02:16:13.542 --> 02:16:17.792 line:82%
Many happy returns of the day.

1272
02:16:24.208 --> 02:16:26.583 line:82%
So how old is Chandigarh?

1273
02:16:26.792 --> 02:16:29.375 line:82%
-Beauty has no age, Sam.
-Really?

1274
02:16:37.417 --> 02:16:39.833 line:82%
The next thing I know,
there'll be nude girls dances.

1275
02:16:39.917 --> 02:16:41.125 line:82%
So you can join them, too.

1276
02:17:19.833 --> 02:17:22.042 line:82%
Our wedding pictures.

1277
02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:27.125 line:82%
You know what I am saying to Dev here?

1278
02:17:27.708 --> 02:17:30.917 line:82%
Now that the vows are made,
I'll kill you if you don't stick to them.

1279
02:17:37.583 --> 02:17:39.000 line:82%
When Arjun was born.

1280
02:17:40.167 --> 02:17:42.375 line:82%
I have never seen Dev so happy.

1281
02:17:45.417 --> 02:17:48.000 line:82%
Rhea, I'm leaving--

1282
02:17:54.375 --> 02:17:57.333 line:82%
OK. Everything is set.
Dinner at my place at 8.

1283
02:17:58.917 --> 02:18:00.135 line:82%
And yes you are invited, too.

1284
02:18:00.208 --> 02:18:02.938 line:82%
But if you're busy
then we shall understand.

1285
02:18:08.083 --> 02:18:10.625 line:82%
You seem to have settled down here.
Should we?

1286
02:18:14.208 --> 02:18:15.667 line:82%
Can I have Dev back please?

1287
02:19:07.292 --> 02:19:08.375 line:82%
I'm getting married.

1288
02:19:11.833 --> 02:19:12.833 line:82%
To Kamal.

1289
02:19:14.125 --> 02:19:14.958 line:82%
What?

1290
02:19:16.292 --> 02:19:19.250 line:82%
That's the expression I wanted to see.

1291
02:19:20.958 --> 02:19:23.042 line:82%
Sam, what are you doing?

1292
02:19:23.167 --> 02:19:24.167 line:82%
Just joking.

1293
02:19:25.833 --> 02:19:28.792 line:82%
You know we have to do something
about your son's sense of humor.

1294
02:19:29.875 --> 02:19:31.583 line:82%
Smile, my son.
Smile.

1295
02:19:32.042 --> 02:19:35.333 line:82%
You won't die if you do. And even if
you die, you will die with a smile.

1296
02:19:49.625 --> 02:19:51.833 line:82%
At last there's someone
who can shut you up.

1297
02:19:51.938 --> 02:19:53.558 line:82%
He is just talking--

1298
02:19:53.708 --> 02:19:58.583 line:82%
Tell me Rishi, was he always like this
or is this change recent?

1299
02:19:58.958 --> 02:20:02.292 line:82%
He behaves like a tiger now,
but he was a mouse before my mother.

1300
02:20:02.375 --> 02:20:03.625 line:82%
Rishi, behave.

1301
02:20:05.250 --> 02:20:07.375 line:82%
His mother was a very strict woman.

1302
02:20:07.542 --> 02:20:11.833 line:82%
She used to say, 'you can look
but don't you dare touch!'

1303
02:20:13.667 --> 02:20:16.958 line:82%
And these days there's no time to look.

1304
02:20:24.958 --> 02:20:27.750 line:82%
It's not about rules, Mr. Talwar.
It's about limits.

1305
02:20:28.625 --> 02:20:30.500 line:82%
It's very easy to slip in a marriage.

1306
02:20:31.125 --> 02:20:33.667 line:82%
It's difficult to keep control.

1307
02:20:34.417 --> 02:20:37.042 line:82%
I personally feel every relationship
should have its boundaries.

1308
02:20:37.583 --> 02:20:40.417 line:82%
And I believe more the boundaries

1309
02:20:40.958 --> 02:20:43.250 line:82%
more the chances of them being crossed.

1310
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.250 line:82%
Maya, you tell me.
What do you think?

1311
02:20:53.542 --> 02:20:58.792 line:82%
Maya doesn't need to draw any boundaries
because her husband loves her too much.

1312
02:21:00.458 --> 02:21:04.417 line:82%
Flattery. Flattery. When a man uses
flattery it only means two things...

1313
02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:07.125 line:82%
Either he is lying
or he is hiding something.

1314
02:21:07.333 --> 02:21:11.458 line:82%
Really. These days Dev is flattering me.

1315
02:21:11.667 --> 02:21:13.042 line:82%
You think I need to worry?

1316
02:21:16.583 --> 02:21:17.417 line:82%
You should.

1317
02:21:20.333 --> 02:21:23.042 line:82%
Everyone's been speaking a lot.

1318
02:21:23.125 --> 02:21:24.375 line:82%
About relationships.

1319
02:21:25.375 --> 02:21:28.458 line:82%
But relationships are not about words
they are about circumstances.

1320
02:21:29.125 --> 02:21:33.000 line:82%
No one knows why one slips
in a relationship.

1321
02:21:34.583 --> 02:21:37.292 line:82%
Why one falls in love
outside a relationship?

1322
02:21:38.792 --> 02:21:40.125 line:82%
No one knows.

1323
02:21:40.667 --> 02:21:44.792 line:82%
Even I don't know why it happened with me.

1324
02:21:48.833 --> 02:21:49.708 line:82%
But it did...

1325
02:21:54.042 --> 02:21:57.438 line:82%
Rhea, I am in love with someone else.

1326
02:22:00.708 --> 02:22:01.542 line:82%
I'm in love.

1327
02:22:04.333 --> 02:22:07.000 line:82%
I'm sorry, Rhea but that's the truth.

1328
02:22:14.708 --> 02:22:19.792 line:82%
And the woman I fell in love with
is right here.

1329
02:22:31.167 --> 02:22:32.375 line:82%
It's Maya.

1330
02:22:54.708 --> 02:22:56.208 line:82%
What happened, Mr. Talwar?

1331
02:23:10.542 --> 02:23:11.917 line:82%
I was going to kill him before you.

1332
02:23:32.958 --> 02:23:34.250 line:82%
What was wrong with you last night?

1333
02:23:34.958 --> 02:23:36.000 line:82%
What were you saying?

1334
02:23:37.167 --> 02:23:38.250 line:82%
You said whatever you felt like.

1335
02:23:38.583 --> 02:23:39.958 line:82%
Did you think of me even once
while saying all those things?

1336
02:23:40.167 --> 02:23:41.750 line:82%
Now who will answer Rishi's questions?

1337
02:23:41.833 --> 02:23:44.458 line:82%
You. Who else? Just tell him the truth.
I don't care.

1338
02:23:44.542 --> 02:23:47.833 line:82%
Tell him the truth? Then what Dev?

1339
02:23:48.208 --> 02:23:49.083 line:82%
Leave the house?

1340
02:23:49.292 --> 02:23:53.667 line:82%
And come to you? Will you leave Rhea
and your son? Tell me.

1341
02:24:46.292 --> 02:24:47.583 line:82%
You were right, Dev.

1342
02:24:50.667 --> 02:24:53.083 line:82%
You never know what you'll get to see
outside this station.

1343
02:25:08.333 --> 02:25:09.167 line:82%
Let's go.

1344
02:25:28.708 --> 02:25:31.000 line:82%
It's all so dirty. Not been cleaned
for so many days.

1345
02:25:31.083 --> 02:25:33.750 line:82%
Will you have coffee?
What will you have, dad?

1346
02:25:33.833 --> 02:25:38.167 line:82%
Coffee? No. This Rishi,
he just keeps anything anywhere.

1347
02:25:38.417 --> 02:25:42.042 line:82%
He's moved everything around.
Dad, you'll have tea?

1348
02:25:42.125 --> 02:25:44.708 line:82%
You never have tea. I'm crazy.

1349
02:25:44.792 --> 02:25:46.917 line:82%
What am I saying?
Just need to clean all this.

1350
02:27:08.042 --> 02:27:08.875 line:82%
You are late?

1351
02:27:10.958 --> 02:27:14.417 line:82%
Yes. Too late.

1352
02:29:14.250 --> 02:29:15.958 line:82%
I wanted to apologize, Dad.

1353
02:29:20.292 --> 02:29:23.417 line:82%
But apologies are for mistakes.

1354
02:29:28.083 --> 02:29:29.750 line:82%
What's the punishment for selfishness?

1355
02:29:32.625 --> 02:29:33.458 line:82%
Tell me, Dad.

1356
02:29:39.125 --> 02:29:40.417 line:82%
I'm a father.

1357
02:29:43.875 --> 02:29:48.125 line:82%
I can't punish.
I can only advise.

1358
02:29:53.208 --> 02:29:54.375 line:82%
Leave Rishi.

1359
02:29:58.292 --> 02:29:59.833 line:82%
You don't love him.

1360
02:30:04.625 --> 02:30:06.208 line:82%
By being with him like this

1361
02:30:06.292 --> 02:30:08.792 line:82%
you are keeping him away from his true

1362
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:10.958 line:82%
And yourself, too.

1363
02:30:14.917 --> 02:30:20.583 line:82%
These incomplete relationships will
bring happiness to no one.

1364
02:30:27.542 --> 02:30:29.542 line:82%
It's not your fault, Maya.

1365
02:30:35.333 --> 02:30:39.208 line:82%
Love and death

1366
02:30:42.333 --> 02:30:44.542 line:82%
both come uninvited.

1367
02:30:47.417 --> 02:30:48.875 line:82%
No one has any control over them.

1368
02:31:17.167 --> 02:31:19.292 line:82%
He's going away.

1369
02:31:55.375 --> 02:31:56.833 line:82%
Chandigarh...

1370
02:32:21.292 --> 02:32:24.125 line:82%
We knew this was the end of our journey.

1371
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.542 line:82%
These were the last few
breaths of our love story.

1372
02:32:29.417 --> 02:32:30.750 line:82%
We had to collect these moments.

1373
02:32:30.917 --> 02:32:33.833 line:82%
and breathe a new life into
our old relationships.

1374
02:32:35.958 --> 02:32:38.167 line:82%
It was time to go home.

1375
02:32:39.417 --> 02:32:42.792 line:82%
We had to tell Rishi and Rhea the truth.

1376
02:32:44.292 --> 02:32:47.167 line:82%
Because happiness can never bloom
in the shadow of lies.

1377
02:32:48.042 --> 02:32:49.958 line:82%
No one knew this better than us.

1378
02:32:52.458 --> 02:32:53.292 line:82%
Who else?

1379
02:33:52.333 --> 02:33:53.167 line:82%
Rhea...

1380
02:33:59.750 --> 02:34:03.958 line:82%
There's another woman in my life.

1381
02:34:08.250 --> 02:34:09.542 line:82%
I'm not joking.

1382
02:34:13.833 --> 02:34:15.167 line:82%
For the last six months.

1383
02:34:20.167 --> 02:34:25.958 line:82%
But that relationship is over now.

1384
02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:37.958 line:82%
Why it happened.
I don't have any answer.

1385
02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:46.875 line:82%
But now...

1386
02:34:49.875 --> 02:34:55.098 line:82%
I want to give our marriage
another chance.

1387
02:34:58.208 --> 02:34:59.708 line:82%
Do you love her?

1388
02:35:03.375 --> 02:35:04.917 line:82%
How does it matter?

1389
02:35:07.875 --> 02:35:09.125 line:82%
It matters to me.

1390
02:35:16.167 --> 02:35:20.375 line:82%
If I had to do what you did,
would you forgive me?

1391
02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:31.417 line:82%
You wouldn't, Dev.
You would never forgive me.

1392
02:35:49.542 --> 02:35:50.833 line:82%
You will have to leave this house.

1393
02:36:17.542 --> 02:36:20.833 line:82%
Rishi, listen to me.

1394
02:36:21.833 --> 02:36:25.542 line:82%
Listen to me. Rishi. Rishi...

1395
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:12.583 line:82%
How strange Maya, that you kept
cleaning this house all the time.

1396
02:37:12.667 --> 02:37:15.875 line:82%
and today you have brought
in so much filth.

1397
02:37:16.042 --> 02:37:18.083 line:82%
-Don't say that, Rishi.
-Then what should I say?

1398
02:37:20.458 --> 02:37:21.458 line:82%
What should I do?

1399
02:37:24.208 --> 02:37:25.333 line:82%
Celebrate?

1400
02:37:57.917 --> 02:38:00.042 line:82%
Why did you do this?

1401
02:38:05.208 --> 02:38:07.667 line:82%
I loved you so much.

1402
02:38:10.875 --> 02:38:12.583 line:82%
More than my own self.

1403
02:38:14.042 --> 02:38:15.542 line:82%
More than life.

1404
02:38:18.167 --> 02:38:20.083 line:82%
But it wasn't enough for you, right?

1405
02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:24.958 line:82%
-Right, Maya?
-It's not like that, Rishi.

1406
02:38:25.042 --> 02:38:26.500 line:82%
Then how is it, Maya?

1407
02:38:34.458 --> 02:38:35.292 line:82%
You know...

1408
02:38:38.667 --> 02:38:42.500 line:82%
every morning I woke up
to look into your eyes.

1409
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:49.542 line:82%
To search for my face.

1410
02:38:57.750 --> 02:38:59.875 line:82%
But now I will only see him.

1411
02:39:04.958 --> 02:39:10.667 line:82%
And I will not be able to bear that.

1412
02:39:14.042 --> 02:39:16.542 line:82%
But that relationship is over, Rishi.

1413
02:39:19.083 --> 02:39:20.875 line:82%
This relationship is over, Maya.

1414
02:39:43.208 --> 02:39:44.667 line:82%
Then I'll leave?

1415
02:39:49.333 --> 02:39:50.667 line:82%
I won't stop you.

1416
02:40:29.875 --> 02:40:30.708 line:82%
Rhea.

1417
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.878 line:82%
I want to say something to you.

1418
02:40:39.698 --> 02:40:42.750 line:82%
Dev didn't ask me before stepping
out of this marriage.

1419
02:40:43.875 --> 02:40:46.708 line:82%
Neither did you ask me
before throwing him out.

1420
02:40:47.667 --> 02:40:53.625 line:82%
But my grandson's eyes ask me
whether I'm going to leave him.

1421
02:40:56.917 --> 02:40:58.542 line:82%
I can't do that, Rhea.

1422
02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:02.792 line:82%
So if you have no objections.

1423
02:41:03.917 --> 02:41:05.708 line:82%
I would like to stay with you.

1424
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.208 line:82%
Can I?

1425
02:42:41.678 --> 02:42:44.833 line:82%
Yeah. Got dialed by mistake.

1426
02:42:46.978 --> 02:42:48.083 line:82%
Are you OK?

1427
02:42:52.917 --> 02:42:56.917 line:82%
Did you... tell Rishi... Rishi?

1428
02:42:57.292 --> 02:43:00.500 line:82%
Yeah I told Rishi everything.

1429
02:43:00.798 --> 02:43:02.125 line:82%
What did he say?

1430
02:43:02.542 --> 02:43:03.958 line:82%
He was very angry at first.

1431
02:43:04.625 --> 02:43:08.918 line:82%
But with time I know he will forgive me.

1432
02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:17.833 line:82%
And Rhea?

1433
02:43:18.958 --> 02:43:22.583 line:82%
Even she will forgive me with time.

1434
02:43:36.538 --> 02:43:37.833 line:82%
Yeah, Rhea, I'm coming.

1435
02:43:39.375 --> 02:43:43.083 line:82%
Even I am at home with Rishi.

1436
02:43:45.458 --> 02:43:46.500 line:82%
Be happy.

1437
02:44:04.875 --> 02:44:05.958 line:82%
Goodbye.

1438
02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:11.458 line:82%
All our relationships were
defined by this one word.

1439
02:44:12.125 --> 02:44:16.417 line:82%
Both of us left our homes
and didn't even tell each other about it.

1440
02:44:17.583 --> 02:44:19.583 line:82%
I had never seen
the hope of meeting again.

1441
02:44:19.667 --> 02:44:24.250 line:82%
Die such a silent death before.

1442
02:45:03.167 --> 02:45:08.500 line:82%
Your heart knows

1443
02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:15.292 line:82%
And so does mine

1444
02:45:16.167 --> 02:45:21.792 line:82%
That our roads

1445
02:45:22.375 --> 02:45:28.125 line:82%
Are meant to part

1446
02:45:28.542 --> 02:45:31.542 line:82%
Far apart

1447
02:45:31.708 --> 02:45:34.750 line:82%
Though we will be

1448
02:45:35.083 --> 02:45:40.667 line:82%
Please don't go away from my memories...

1449
02:45:40.875 --> 02:45:46.583 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1450
02:45:47.418 --> 02:45:52.878 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1451
02:45:53.698 --> 02:45:59.398 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1452
02:46:57.333 --> 02:47:03.333 line:82%
All the mirth in life
have slipped away slowly.

1453
02:47:03.542 --> 02:47:08.750 line:82%
It's the pain that refuses to go away

1454
02:47:09.542 --> 02:47:15.500 line:82%
Tried to wish it away
Tried to laugh it away

1455
02:47:15.833 --> 02:47:21.708 line:82%
But the heart falls to find peace

1456
02:47:22.792 --> 02:47:25.208 line:82%
Falls to find peace

1457
02:47:25.542 --> 02:47:30.792 line:82%
Are these tears? Or is it cinder?

1458
02:47:31.542 --> 02:47:37.083 line:82%
Just fire that flows freely from my eyes

1459
02:47:37.898 --> 02:47:43.398 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1460
02:47:44.218 --> 02:47:49.938 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1461
02:47:50.598 --> 02:47:55.318 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1462
02:48:53.917 --> 02:48:59.750 line:82%
Seasons come and seasons go

1463
02:48:59.833 --> 02:49:05.833 line:82%
But the season of pain is here to stay

1464
02:49:06.375 --> 02:49:12.208 line:82%
The shade of sorrow is so deep

1465
02:49:13.292 --> 02:49:19.083 line:82%
That it will take a while to pale

1466
02:49:19.708 --> 02:49:22.000 line:82%
It won't fade away

1467
02:49:22.375 --> 02:49:28.042 line:82%
Who knows what's to happen ahead

1468
02:49:28.667 --> 02:49:34.417 line:82%
Who knows what's in store for us to bear

1469
02:49:34.558 --> 02:49:38.398 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1470
02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:46.708 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1471
02:49:47.418 --> 02:49:53.318 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1472
02:49:54.208 --> 02:50:00.098 line:82%
Your heart knows

1473
02:50:00.375 --> 02:50:06.333 line:82%
And so does mine

1474
02:50:06.792 --> 02:50:12.750 line:82%
That our roads

1475
02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:18.998 line:82%
Are meant to part

1476
02:50:19.542 --> 02:50:24.917 line:82%
Far apart though we will be

1477
02:50:25.917 --> 02:50:31.833 line:82%
Please don't go away from my memories

1478
02:50:32.258 --> 02:50:37.758 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1479
02:50:38.583 --> 02:50:44.458 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1480
02:50:44.998 --> 02:50:50.818 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1481
02:50:51.518 --> 02:50:57.138 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1482
02:50:57.750 --> 02:51:03.625 line:82%
Never say goodbye

1483
02:51:57.917 --> 02:51:58.915 line:82%
Do you know Maya,

1484
02:51:58.999 --> 02:52:01.667 line:82%
that in these three years,
I tried hard to hate you.

1485
02:52:02.875 --> 02:52:07.625 line:82%
To forget you.
But I couldn't.

1486
02:52:10.542 --> 02:52:11.833 line:82%
I couldn't do it, Maya.

1487
02:52:16.375 --> 02:52:21.417 line:82%
You gave up the house,
but the house could never give you up.

1488
02:52:24.292 --> 02:52:27.833 line:82%
You were right. I was a child.

1489
02:52:28.333 --> 02:52:33.583 line:82%
I could never understand you.
And that I realize today.

1490
02:52:38.333 --> 02:52:39.625 line:82%
I have grown up, Maya.

1491
02:52:46.583 --> 02:52:48.167 line:82%
I am in love again.

1492
02:52:50.458 --> 02:52:51.833 line:82%
I'm getting married.

1493
02:52:57.042 --> 02:52:58.250 line:82%
Won't you say anything?

1494
02:53:34.125 --> 02:53:35.875 line:82%
I don't have anyone besides you.

1495
02:54:18.375 --> 02:54:23.208 line:82%
Wherever he is,
he is with us.

1496
02:54:31.167 --> 02:54:32.458 line:82%
He is with you.

1497
02:54:55.658 --> 02:54:57.875 line:82%
I am being a mother
to my son after many years.

1498
02:54:59.042 --> 02:55:04.583 line:82%
At this point I'm happy with this
one relationship and...

1499
02:55:04.792 --> 02:55:06.292 line:82%
You don't have to say anything.

1500
02:55:10.292 --> 02:55:12.542 line:82%
I'll be waiting. OK?

1501
02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:54.458 line:82%
I know.

1502
02:55:56.583 --> 02:55:58.792 line:82%
He probably forgot
that I was leaving today.

1503
02:56:00.417 --> 02:56:01.250 line:82%
Rhea.

1504
02:56:04.625 --> 02:56:07.167 line:82%
I have lost my right
to ask you for forgiveness.

1505
02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.338 line:82%
But I don't want to lose
the right to bless you.

1506
02:57:31.875 --> 02:57:36.250 line:82%
Rishi? Your wedding? What about Maya?

1507
02:57:36.583 --> 02:57:39.125 line:82%
Maya and I separated three years ago.

1508
02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:44.875 line:82%
And you here? With Jai?

1509
02:57:45.498 --> 02:57:47.708 line:82%
Dev and I divorced three years ago.

1510
02:57:53.417 --> 02:57:58.333 line:82%
But do Dev and Maya know this?

1511
02:58:30.583 --> 02:58:31.833 line:82%
What's the matter, Maya?

1512
02:58:32.333 --> 02:58:36.417 line:82%
Can't look me in the eye.
Can't face me.

1513
02:58:37.250 --> 02:58:42.375 line:82%
Because you broke my heart? My home?

1514
02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.333 line:82%
How could you break something
that was already broken, Maya?

1515
02:58:48.250 --> 02:58:52.917 line:82%
Maybe you shouldn't have filled
the void between Dev and me.

1516
02:58:54.917 --> 02:58:59.417 line:82%
But what could you do?
Dev's love is like that.

1517
02:59:01.098 --> 02:59:04.042 line:82%
Ask me.
I know.

1518
02:59:05.292 --> 02:59:09.375 line:82%
Don't be so large-hearted Rhea
that I feel even smaller.

1519
02:59:09.792 --> 02:59:11.542 line:82%
I'm not that magnanimous.

1520
02:59:12.958 --> 02:59:16.708 line:82%
When Dev told me about you I left him.

1521
02:59:20.458 --> 02:59:22.000 line:82%
But I don't think you know that.

1522
02:59:27.792 --> 02:59:32.792 line:82%
How strange.
The love that changed the destinies

1523
02:59:33.625 --> 02:59:36.250 line:82%
of two homes today stands destitute.

1524
02:59:37.458 --> 02:59:40.917 line:82%
I moved on. Rishi moved on.

1525
02:59:42.478 --> 02:59:44.375 line:82%
The two of you got left behind.

1526
02:59:44.792 --> 02:59:46.417 line:82%
Perhaps that's our punishment.

1527
02:59:46.750 --> 02:59:48.250 line:82%
Such a small punishment?

1528
02:59:49.208 --> 02:59:53.583 line:82%
Try living with Dev.
Then you will know what punishment is.

1529
03:00:06.583 --> 03:00:10.833 line:82%
The girl who gets these flowers
gets a new life.

1530
03:00:12.583 --> 03:00:17.792 line:82%
And new happiness. And I want that girl
to be you, Maya.

1531
03:00:20.625 --> 03:00:22.917 line:82%
Your heart has been searching
for love for many years.

1532
03:00:24.917 --> 03:00:26.500 line:82%
And that love is Dev.

1533
03:00:30.625 --> 03:00:35.750 line:82%
And if you don't hurry now your love
will move further away from you.

1534
03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:38.438 line:82%
Dev is leaving for Toronto.

1535
03:01:43.583 --> 03:01:44.417 line:82%
And Rhea?

1536
03:01:44.792 --> 03:01:48.750 line:82%
Even she will forgive me with time.

1537
03:04:12.500 --> 03:04:14.977 line:82%
Aren't you a little overdressed
for the station?

1538
03:04:20.792 --> 03:04:22.197 line:82%
It's been a while hasn't it?

1539
03:04:23.583 --> 03:04:25.125 line:82%
I don't live here anymore.

1540
03:04:27.042 --> 03:04:28.837 line:82%
And I don't live here despite being here.

1541
03:04:33.625 --> 03:04:37.917 line:82%
Nothing's changed, Dev.
You still get angry at everything.

1542
03:04:39.667 --> 03:04:41.542 line:82%
Anger's my own. Doesn't leave me.

1543
03:04:44.657 --> 03:04:46.167 line:82%
Love can always leave and go.

1544
03:04:47.375 --> 03:04:50.037 line:82%
What will you do if you find
your lost love?

1545
03:04:51.417 --> 03:04:55.917 line:82%
What will I say now, Maya.
I'll just say 'go back'.

1546
03:04:56.917 --> 03:04:57.750 line:82%
Just go.

1547
03:04:58.500 --> 03:04:59.417 line:82%
Dev...

1548
03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:06.167 line:82%
Only I know how I have
survived these three years.

1549
03:05:08.417 --> 03:05:12.417 line:82%
There was not a moment in the day
when I didn't think of you.

1550
03:05:14.042 --> 03:05:19.125 line:82%
But I used to convince myself
that you are alright.

1551
03:05:20.792 --> 03:05:24.292 line:82%
That you are happy with your family.

1552
03:05:25.625 --> 03:05:27.458 line:82%
I used to think of your happiness

1553
03:05:29.017 --> 03:05:30.958 line:82%
and it would reduce a bit
of my unhappiness.

1554
03:05:34.167 --> 03:05:35.792 line:82%
But today I realized

1555
03:05:36.667 --> 03:05:40.797 line:82%
that you have been as alone as I am.

1556
03:05:45.458 --> 03:05:46.292 line:82%
Yes, Dev.

1557
03:05:48.333 --> 03:05:53.083 line:82%
Even I have been alone for three years.

1558
03:05:54.083 --> 03:05:55.997 line:82%
Alone, just like you.

1559
03:06:01.083 --> 03:06:02.125 line:82%
Why, Dev?

1560
03:06:03.583 --> 03:06:06.477 line:82%
Why did all this happen? Why?

1561
03:06:06.917 --> 03:06:09.708 line:82%
Why did we meet? And then part?

1562
03:06:10.667 --> 03:06:13.208 line:82%
Why, Dev? Why?

1563
03:06:27.333 --> 03:06:29.333 line:82%
Everyone shares happiness and sorrow.

1564
03:06:30.837 --> 03:06:33.042 line:82%
I want to share my punishment with you.

1565
03:06:34.625 --> 03:06:37.917 line:82%
My life may not be complete
living with you

1566
03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.333 line:82%
but at least it will be a life.

1567
03:06:44.708 --> 03:06:47.208 line:82%
Will you share this incomplete life
with me, Maya.

1568
03:06:51.625 --> 03:06:54.250 line:82%
Answer me, Maya.
It's hurting.

1569
03:06:57.833 --> 03:07:00.792 line:82%
Answer me.
I can't sit here the whole day.

1570
03:07:08.250 --> 03:07:10.137 line:82%
Speak politely.

1571
03:07:51.417 --> 03:07:52.250 line:82%
Now?

1572
03:07:52.333 --> 03:07:55.000 line:82%
Now what? Fifteen days in jail.

1573
03:07:55.167 --> 03:07:56.000 line:82%
What?

1574
03:07:56.625 --> 03:07:59.000 line:82%
Yeah I stopped the train by pulling
the chain.

1575
03:08:05.417 --> 03:08:10.125 line:82%
The foundation of a marriage
should only be love.

1576
03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:11.500 line:82%
And nothing else...

1577
03:08:12.333 --> 03:08:16.125 line:82%
Because if the foundation is wrong,
relationships end.

1578
03:08:16.417 --> 03:08:17.917 line:82%
like it happened with us.

1579
03:08:18.708 --> 03:08:23.167 line:82%
Years later, we found love.
We found our happiness.

1580
03:08:24.750 --> 03:08:26.583 line:82%
But we just wish that,

1581
03:08:27.458 --> 03:08:32.542 line:82%
the road to our destination didn't have
to be paved with broken hearts.
