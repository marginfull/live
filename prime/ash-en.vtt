[Riya] Are you sure?
Because if you're not...

They made it.

00:42:17.458 --> 00:42:19.541 line:80%
[Clarke chuckles]
How many of these are there?

536
00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:22.625 line:80%
[Kevin]
Across the whole planet?
Dozens, maybe hundreds, maybe more.

537
00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:24.708 line:80%
At least to the extent
that Brion could observe it.

538
00:42:24.791 --> 00:42:26.625 line:80%
Emission signatures,
they get a little diffused

539
00:42:26.708 --> 00:42:28.708 line:80%
by the time they reach orbit.
I mean, this is it.

540

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.291 line:80%
[Clarke] Just-- just be careful,
all right?

545
00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:44.333 line:80%
[Davis] Oh, you guys, come on.
I can handle it.

557
00:43:24.166 --> 00:43:25.500 line:80%
[Kevin] We gotta get out of here.

Listen to me.

566
00:44:06.375 --> 00:44:07.708 line:80%
I didn't know.

[Brion] Not for sure.

568
00:44:10.416 --> 00:44:13.875 line:80%
[Brion] I knew that you went on a mission,
but you went dark.

569
00:44:13.958 --> 00:44:16.166 line:80%
The entire station went dark, okay?

570
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.583 line:80%
I didn't know that this was how--
how Dav--

571
00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:20.583 line:80%
You knew why we were out there.

572
00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:23.000 line:80%
You knew.

573
00:44:24.041 --> 00:44:26.083 line:80%
Kevin talks about it in the fucking video.

574
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.541 line:80%
[Riya] This entire time you saw me
go around in fucking circles

575
00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:35.291 line:80%
over and over trying to decipher
what the fuck had happened

576
00:44:35.375 --> 00:44:38.625 line:80%
to Kevin, to Clarke, to Audie, to Davis.

577
00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:42.083 line:80%
I was going fucking crazy
when the entire time you knew

578
00:44:42.166 --> 00:44:44.208 line:80%
this planet was being terraformed.

579
00:44:44.291 --> 00:44:45.583 line:80%
There was a window.

580
00:44:45.666 --> 00:44:50.041 line:80%
Okay, I had a mission and a window,
and the only way to fulfill the mission

581
00:44:50.125 --> 00:44:53.750 line:80%
-was to keep things under control during--
-To keep me under control! Me!

582
00:44:53.833 --> 00:44:56.416 line:80%
Because I know you, okay?
I know how you are.

583
00:44:58.125 --> 00:45:01.208 line:80%
You may have lost your memory,
but you haven't changed at all.

584
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.958 line:80%
Okay, why can't you just let it go?
For once.

585
00:45:05.708 --> 00:45:09.000 line:80%
For once, until we are up there.
Until we are safe.

586
00:45:13.375 --> 00:45:14.583 line:80%
Because I killed them.

587
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:16.875 line:80%
What?

588
00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:19.250 line:80%
What'd you--

589
00:45:20.958 --> 00:45:22.083 line:80%
I killed Kev.

590
00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:26.416 line:80%
I killed Audie, and I...

591
00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:29.125 line:80%
I just don't know...

592
00:45:35.958 --> 00:45:37.125 line:80%
I don't know why I did it.

593
00:45:39.041 --> 00:45:40.000 line:80%
I don't.

594
00:45:41.416 --> 00:45:42.416 line:80%
I just...

595
00:45:47.541 --> 00:45:49.375 line:80%
If we leave this station,
I'm never gonna know.

596
00:45:50.875 --> 00:45:53.208 line:80%
I-- I-- I need to know.

597
00:45:53.291 --> 00:45:56.125 line:80%
-Brion, I need to know. I can't leave.
-Hey, hey, hey.

598
00:45:57.333 --> 00:45:58.625 line:80%
What are you saying to me?

599
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:01.458 line:80%
I don't...

600
00:46:02.708 --> 00:46:04.041 line:80%
I don't know why I did it.

601
00:46:07.958 --> 00:46:09.125 line:80%
These patches...

602
00:46:12.625 --> 00:46:13.875 line:80%
When they're fading, I've...

603
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:15.666 line:80%
I start having more memories.

604
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.791 line:80%
I can remember everything,
and it comes back faster.

605
00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:19.583 line:80%
Maybe-- maybe we can...

606
00:46:20.333 --> 00:46:21.583 line:80%
we can wait for two more hours.

607
00:46:21.666 --> 00:46:23.833 line:80%
-They've been coming quicker and quicker.
-[Brion] Not a chance. Not a chance.

608
00:46:23.916 --> 00:46:26.375 line:80%
-Why not?!
-Because I don't trust you!

609
00:46:26.958 --> 00:46:27.875 line:80%
Okay?!

610
00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:36.791 line:80%
[scoffs] All right, listen to me.

611
00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:37.791 line:80%
I...

612
00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:42.333 line:80%
I trust you. I just don't know
the person that did this.

613
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.750 line:80%
Okay? And I don't know
who you would become

614
00:46:46.833 --> 00:46:48.583 line:80%
if you stopped using these things.

615
00:46:53.875 --> 00:46:55.208 line:80%
We were gonna go up there.

616
00:46:57.166 --> 00:46:58.083 line:80%
What if I...

617
00:46:59.875 --> 00:47:02.875 line:80%
-if I don't remember?
-Then you don't remember.

618
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:05.916 line:80%
And you live with it.

619
00:47:09.208 --> 00:47:10.083 line:80%
[Brion] Riya.

620
00:47:11.375 --> 00:47:12.541 line:80%
Listen to me.

621
00:47:13.541 --> 00:47:14.458 line:80%
You and I...

622
00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:16.833 line:80%
we have a purpose.

623
00:47:18.416 --> 00:47:19.333 line:80%
Okay?

624
00:47:19.958 --> 00:47:24.041 line:80%
We sacrificed our lives on Earth
to come out here for a reason.

625
00:47:24.958 --> 00:47:25.875 line:80%
This.

626
00:47:26.875 --> 00:47:28.750 line:80%
This is about our species.

627
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.041 line:80%
The big picture.

628
00:47:32.875 --> 00:47:35.000 line:80%
Okay? What we have uncovered here,

629
00:47:35.083 --> 00:47:39.041 line:80%
proof of alien intelligence
somewhere out there.

630
00:47:39.125 --> 00:47:42.083 line:80%
There is technology to mold planets.

631
00:47:43.958 --> 00:47:48.416 line:80%
This could change the fate
of our entire existence.

632
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:54.208 line:80%
Our priority has to be about
the preservation of our mission.

633
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:58.708 line:80%
Do you understand this?

634
00:48:02.083 --> 00:48:02.916 line:80%
Riya.

635
00:48:04.541 --> 00:48:06.333 line:80%
