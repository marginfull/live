1
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.340 line:82%
Keep it.

2
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.130 line:82%
Is the cocaine in the case?

3
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.420 line:82%
No, T.J.

4
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.830 line:82%
I'm here to give you
my birthday card.

5
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.270 line:82%
Where is my money?

6
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.360 line:82%
Right here.

7
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.750 line:82%
Here's your full and final payment.

8
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.730 line:82%
Now...

9
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.970 line:82%
Put your hands up.

10
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.797 line:82%
No.

11
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.440 line:82%
- Put them up!
- Relax sweetheart!

12
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.610 line:82%
I said "no" because T.J.

13
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.750 line:82%
forgot to say "please."

14
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.020 line:82%
Please, put your hands up.

15
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.000 line:82%
You think you're very smart.

16
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.430 line:82%
But not this time.

17
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.340 line:82%
This time I keep the case for free.

18
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.760 line:82%
And because I know you will
want to avenge this day,

19
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.930 line:82%
you'll have to die.

20
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.780 line:82%
T.J.!

21
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.680 line:82%
Do you know that there are 36 points
on the human body,

22
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.120 line:82%
that if struck right,

23
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.120 line:82%
could prove fatal.

24
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.770 line:82%
Is that so?

25
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.647 line:82%
It's just that I'm in a
dilemma now.

26
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.757 line:82%
About what?

27
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.390 line:82%
About who, between
the two of you,

28
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.250 line:82%
I should I kill first!

29
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.870 line:82%
I always liked you Don.

30
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.560 line:82%
Me too, T.J.

31
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.310 line:82%
I've also always

32
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.990 line:82%
liked me.

33
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.860 line:82%
Don't shoot, don't shoot...

34
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.850 line:82%
If you kill me

35
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.450 line:82%
my men won't let you live long.

36
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.207 line:82%
You will get caught.

37
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.330 line:82%
No, T.J.

38
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.180 line:82%
Not only is it difficult to catch Don...

39
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.620 line:82%
It's Impossible!

40
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.660 line:82%
I want to thank you

41
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.160 line:82%
for your help on behalf
of our government.

42
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.830 line:82%
We know the gang we're looking for

43
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.200 line:82%
has made Kuala Lumpur its base.

44
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.110 line:82%
Our Chief Investigating Officer,
Mr. D'Silva, will give you the details.

45
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.280 line:82%
Sir...

46
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.190 line:82%
Thank you Verma.

47
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.870 line:82%
Gentlemen, I'll come to the point.

48
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.620 line:82%
First, let me tell you all we know
about this gang.

49
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.270 line:82%
Verma...

50
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.950 line:82%
When the Soviet Union split up in 1990,
a number of small nations were born.

51
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.790 line:82%
Selling arms to terrorists and
fundamentalist groups

52
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.660 line:82%
became a lucrative business for
a few people in these countries.

53
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.730 line:82%
One of the new empires built with this
money was headed by a man named Boris.

54
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.040 line:82%
Verma...

55
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.620 line:82%
When these empires crumbled under
international pressure,

56
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.710 line:82%
Boris disappeared.

57
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.057 line:82%
And after years of searching,

58
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.670 line:82%
he was presumed dead when he wasn't found.

59
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.830 line:82%
But Boris was not dead.

60
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.760 line:82%
He had gone to India.

61
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:37.200 line:82%
He invested the money he made
selling arms into drugs.

62
00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.700 line:82%
He bought drugs in bulk from
Afghanistan, Pakistan and India,

63
00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.190 line:82%
and started distributing
them in Europe.

64
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.700 line:82%
His two invaluable lieutenants
in this business,

65
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.410 line:82%
Vardhaan and Singhania.

66
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.657 line:82%
We don't have a single
photograph of Vardhaan.

67
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.190 line:82%
Nor do we know who or
where he is.

68
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.370 line:82%
The reason?

69
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.490 line:82%
This is Singhania.

70
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.540 line:82%
It is rumored that Boris wanted to
hand over the business to Vardhaan,

71
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.660 line:82%
but Singhania murdered Boris.

72
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.080 line:82%
Did he kill Vardhaan too?

73
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.080 line:82%
Perhaps he did.

74
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.670 line:82%
Because there's been no trace
of Vardhaan since then.

75
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.300 line:82%
And this is Don.

76
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.950 line:82%
He manages Singhania's
business here.

77
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.030 line:82%
Given the information we have,
it is clear

78
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.580 line:82%
that the most dangerous and cunning
criminal among them all

79
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.950 line:82%
is this man.

80
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.340 line:82%
Good shot.

81
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.080 line:82%
Yeah, Narang.

82
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.280 line:82%
Hello, Anita.

83
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.370 line:82%
Mr. Singhania called.

84
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.500 line:82%
He wanted to know
how the police know so much

85
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.580 line:82%
about our operation.

86
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.980 line:82%
It's hard to say.

87
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.120 line:82%
All our men are very loyal.

88
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.800 line:82%
Is that so?

89
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.667 line:82%
What madness is this, Don?

90
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.660 line:82%
Narang... this is a good shot.

91
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.580 line:82%
Did you see Kumar's feet?

92
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.950 line:82%
Terrible shoes!

93
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000 line:82%
I didn't like his shoes!

94
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.700 line:82%
Ramesh...

95
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.500 line:82%
This loyal man of yours was
actually a police informant.

96
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.540 line:82%
Before you recruit anyone next time,

97
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.620 line:82%
please get him to meet me once.

98
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.760 line:82%
Or check his shoes, at least.

99
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.190 line:82%
Kumar.

100
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.750 line:82%
I don't understand.

101
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.537 line:82%
How did they find out
he was our informant?

102
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.800 line:82%
Good question!

103
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.327 line:82%
You are...?

104
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.330 line:82%
Vishal Malik. I'm with
Interpol.

105
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.830 line:82%
I see.

106
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.790 line:82%
- I am...
- DCP D'Silva. I know.

107
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.950 line:82%
And now I'd like to know how a fact known
only to top Indian officers

108
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.160 line:82%
came to Don's knowledge?

109
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.740 line:82%
I don't know.

110
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.250 line:82%
By the way,

111
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.400 line:82%
who told you?

112
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080 line:82%
Excuse us.

113
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.920 line:82%
I'm sorry, Mr. D'Silva.
I wasn't pointing a finger at you.

114
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.500 line:82%
Then who?

115
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.250 line:82%
Inspector Verma.

116
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.410 line:82%
See, he is young.

117
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.080 line:82%
Recently inducted onto
the force.

118
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.387 line:82%
Newly married, it's quite possible...

119
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.950 line:82%
...Mr. Malik, I wonder if you're
actually drinking coffee?

120
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.500 line:82%
Just checking.

121
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.260 line:82%
I trust Inspector Verma.

122
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.080 line:82%
Anything else?

123
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.080 line:82%
Yes. I, too, am involved in this
investigation from now.

124
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.790 line:82%
Hi, Kamini.

125
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.160 line:82%
That's great news.

126
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.120 line:82%
Where are the two of you?

127
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.807 line:82%
That was quick.

128
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.500 line:82%
I am so happy, Kamini.

129
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.080 line:82%
If my brother wants a better life today,
it's all because of you.

130
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.120 line:82%
Thank you.

131
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.950 line:82%
Anyways, our hero is in a
pretty bad mood.

132
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.500 line:82%
Why?

133
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000 line:82%
Hi, Roma.

134
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.410 line:82%
I know a lot about them.

135
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.450 line:82%
If Don even suspects that
I am leaving him,

136
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.960 line:82%
he'll kill me.

137
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.130 line:82%
Ramesh...

138
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.270 line:82%
By the time Don finds out
we'll be long gone.

139
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.120 line:82%
Anyway, I am gonna see you
at the airport tonight, okay?

140
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.410 line:82%
I know that after Mom
and Dad died,

141
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.290 line:82%
whatever you did was, to an extent,
for my happiness.

142
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.910 line:82%
But I wasn't happy.

143
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.660 line:82%
Nor did I feel what you
were doing was right.

144
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.920 line:82%
Until today.

145
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.500 line:82%
I am proud of you.

146
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.660 line:82%
Yes, Narang.

147
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.830 line:82%
Poor Ramesh.

148
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.120 line:82%
Ramesh...

149
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.670 line:82%
Very sad.

150
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.060 line:82%
Very sad.

151
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.790 line:82%
I always thought of you as reliable.

152
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.450 line:82%
But unfortunately, you didn't
think the same of me.

153
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.260 line:82%
All you had to do

154
00:16:16.931 --> 00:16:18.410 line:82%
was tell me you wanted out.

155
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.660 line:82%
And I'd have arranged it
all for you.

156
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.320 line:82%
Don, I...

157
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.450 line:82%
Don, I...

158
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.620 line:82%
Yes, what?

159
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.850 line:82%
I made a mistake.

160
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.450 line:82%
Why are you saying that?

161
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.910 line:82%
Your love for that girl...

162
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.540 line:82%
What's her name?

163
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.870 line:82%
Kamini.

164
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.700 line:82%
Kamini!

165
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.910 line:82%
Your love for Kamini
isn't a mistake?

166
00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.170 line:82%
Anyway...

167
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.250 line:82%
I am here to say goodbye.

168
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.990 line:82%
Ramesh...

169
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.079 line:82%
Have a nice life.

170
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:08.920 line:82%
Yeah?

171
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.440 line:82%
One dirty fish can make the
entire pond dirty.

172
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.369 line:82%
But if that pond

173
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.040 line:82%
is to become mine,

174
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.540 line:82%
It becomes necessary to kill it.

175
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.270 line:82%
Ramesh...

176
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.830 line:82%
People don't leave Don.

177
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.290 line:82%
They leave this world.

178
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.945 line:82%
Kamini...

179
00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:13.780 line:82%
I need to ask you a few questions.

180
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.270 line:82%
What do you want to know?

181
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.040 line:82%
Ramesh was always with Don.

182
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.680 line:82%
Is that true?

183
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.750 line:82%
Yes.

184
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.890 line:82%
Do you remember any particular place
that Ramesh used to go often?

185
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.450 line:82%
Yes.

186
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:47.950 line:82%
Tell me.

187
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.540 line:82%
This information can help
me catch Don.

188
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.860 line:82%
It's not my desire to
get him caught, Officer.

189
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.000 line:82%
Kamini, don't do anything that

190
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.370 line:82%
could put your life at risk.

191
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.290 line:82%
I don't care whether
I live or die now.

192
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.910 line:82%
But the police department cares.

193
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.750 line:82%
I'm trying to quit...

194
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.620 line:82%
It kills you.

195
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.250 line:82%
This camera, this pistol...

196
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.750 line:82%
Why do you need all this security?

197
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.950 line:82%
Because a "Do Not Disturb" sign
doesn't work in this hotel.

198
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.120 line:82%
What are you thinking?

199
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.750 line:82%
I'm thinking that

200
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.290 line:82%
I don't like two types of girls.

201
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.660 line:82%
One, those who take too long
to succumb to me.

202
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.800 line:82%
The second, those who succumb
too quickly.

203
00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.580 line:82%
And I succumbed too quickly.

204
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.060 line:82%
What did you say your name was?

205
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.790 line:82%
Sonia.

206
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:11.040 line:82%
Sonia, the time between us meeting
and you being in this hotel room

207
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.910 line:82%
is just half an hour.

208
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.700 line:82%
That's because, when I
saw you, I felt

209
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.910 line:82%
it was you I've been
searching for.

210
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.450 line:82%
Romantic talk bores me, Sonia!

211
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.327 line:82%
- Shall I get it?
- No.

212
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.620 line:82%
It's mine.

213
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.790 line:82%
Why don't you go inside

214
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.030 line:82%
and get into something more

215
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.730 line:82%
comfortable.

216
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.390 line:82%
Sure!

217
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.450 line:82%
Yes, Anita.

218
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.510 line:82%
Kamini...

219
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.200 line:82%
Thank God you're okay.

220
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.540 line:82%
Where are you?

221
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.760 line:82%
There isn't anything else to wear.

222
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.320 line:82%
I know.

223
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:18.990 line:82%
Who were you talking to?

224
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.340 line:82%
I'm sorry?

225
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.250 line:82%
Oh, that!

226
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.550 line:82%
To my aunt.

227
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.580 line:82%
She worries needlessly,
if I'm slightly late.

228
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.000 line:82%
I can't tell her the truth,
can I?

229
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.580 line:82%
About where I am

230
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.720 line:82%
and who I'm with.

231
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.580 line:82%
Bring your aunt along
next time.

232
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.250 line:82%
She's not your type, Don.

233
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.000 line:82%
Oh, yes.

234
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.120 line:82%
Why the hurry?

235
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.580 line:82%
Why else would I want
to be here?

236
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.417 line:82%
This heart of mine

237
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.000 line:82%
is crazy for my love

238
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.417 line:82%
His love is like a flame

239
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.800 line:82%
burning in my heart

240
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.970 line:82%
I am willing to let this
flame engulf me

241
00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.690 line:82%
You can't escape from
it's intensity either

242
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.290 line:82%
This heart of mine

243
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.120 line:82%
is crazy for my love

244
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.120 line:82%
This heart of mine

245
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.250 line:82%
is crazy for my love

246
00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:43.450 line:82%
My heart always gets
what it craves for

247
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:50.000 line:82%
But my love can take my life
if my lover requests it

248
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:57.080 line:82%
My heart always gets
what it craves for

249
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:03.700 line:82%
But my love can take my life
if my lover requests it

250
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:10.540 line:82%
I gift you my life
in return for yours

251
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.260 line:82%
This heart of mine

252
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.580 line:82%
is crazy for my love

253
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.477 line:82%
His love is like a flame

254
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.740 line:82%
burning in my heart

255
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.100 line:82%
Every moment that passes

256
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.080 line:82%
A storm rages in my heart

257
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.160 line:82%
As the goal I desire

258
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.260 line:82%
is coming closer

259
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.390 line:82%
Every moment that passes

260
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.760 line:82%
A storm rages in my heart

261
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.120 line:82%
As the goal I desire

262
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.350 line:82%
is coming closer

263
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.957 line:82%
You will never forget the day

264
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.910 line:82%
our hearts collided

265
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.497 line:82%
This heart of mine

266
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.420 line:82%
is crazy for my love

267
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.557 line:82%
His love is like a flame

268
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.000 line:82%
burning in my heart

269
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:49.280 line:82%
I am willing to let this
flame engulf me

270
00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:55.650 line:82%
You can't escape from
it's intensity either

271
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.290 line:82%
This heart of mine

272
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.750 line:82%
is crazy for my love

273
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.320 line:82%
This heart of mine

274
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.290 line:82%
is crazy for my love

275
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.620 line:82%
Your aunt is outside, along with
a bunch of uncles!

276
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.120 line:82%
May I know the reason
for this family reunion?

277
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.000 line:82%
Ramesh was my fiance.

278
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.540 line:82%
He had never mentioned you.

279
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.790 line:82%
I can understand why.

280
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.000 line:82%
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

281
00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.710 line:82%
The pistol is empty.

282
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.090 line:82%
You're right!

283
00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:59.030 line:82%
Let's go. The police are waiting for you.

284
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.970 line:82%
The police of many countries are
waiting for me. But...

285
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.080 line:82%
Sonia...

286
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.830 line:82%
Not only is it difficult to
catch Don...

287
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.560 line:82%
It's Impossible!

288
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.090 line:82%
Really...

289
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.470 line:82%
You know what!

290
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.750 line:82%
You know this pistol is empty.

291
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.870 line:82%
I know the pistol is empty, but...

292
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.370 line:82%
The police don't know
the pistol is empty.

293
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.997 line:82%
And wait for my call,
is that understood?

294
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.117 line:82%
Sir...

295
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.400 line:82%
Verma...

296
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.430 line:82%
Hold it right there.

297
00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.030 line:82%
Surprise, surprise.

298
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.540 line:82%
Please, officers. Put your
guns down. Or else!

299
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.600 line:82%
It would be wise to
surrender, Don!

300
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.290 line:82%
I don't think so.

301
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.800 line:82%
It'd be wiser for you
to move back.

302
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.297 line:82%
I'm asking for the last time.

303
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.420 line:82%
Or I'll be forced to...

304
00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:51.730 line:82%
Stop.

305
00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.100 line:82%
Okay...

306
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.480 line:82%
- Down...
- Good.

307
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.367 line:82%
Come nice and easy
everyone down

308
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.450 line:82%
and move back. A little more.

309
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.540 line:82%
I just want to get out of here.

310
00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.200 line:82%
If you help me, this girl

311
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.660 line:82%
will be grateful to you
all her life.

312
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.510 line:82%
Thank you.

313
00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.310 line:82%
Good night, Gentlemen.

314
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.200 line:82%
Listen to me, Don.

315
00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.500 line:82%
First, call the lift.

316
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.540 line:82%
For the lady.

317
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.750 line:82%
Go on.
Quickly, quickly!

318
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.370 line:82%
Don, I'm unarmed.

319
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.950 line:82%
I couldn't stop you even if I wanted to.
Let the girl go.

320
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.035 line:82%
Of course I will...

321
00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:34.940 line:82%
Once I get out of here.

322
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.720 line:82%
Trust me.

323
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.340 line:82%
No!

324
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.807 line:82%
Damn it.!

325
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:45.900 line:82%
Verma!

326
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.537 line:82%
- What's going on, who are you?
- Questions later.

327
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.127 line:82%
I have to get out of here first.

328
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.260 line:82%
Put the pistol down.
You have no idea who I am!

329
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.750 line:82%
Mr. Narang, police...

330
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.130 line:82%
Move!

331
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.710 line:82%
Stop that car.

332
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.540 line:82%
Put your hands up.

333
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.370 line:82%
And step out of the car.

334
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.330 line:82%
Out of the car!

335
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.190 line:82%
Wait, Vikram!

336
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.910 line:82%
Let's go.

337
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.180 line:82%
Go.

338
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.610 line:82%
Who is this girl?

339
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.140 line:82%
Roma.

340
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.880 line:82%
She can be useful to us.

341
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.080 line:82%
Oh, is she useful?

342
00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.940 line:82%
If you had seen her shoot
two cops a while ago

343
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.950 line:82%
you wouldn't be asking that.

344
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.500 line:82%
Really...

345
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.180 line:82%
Yes, Vikram.

346
00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.640 line:82%
I'll be there right away.

347
00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.830 line:82%
- Come, Roma.
- Go ahead, Narang.

348
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.330 line:82%
I'm in no danger
from this girl.

349
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.120 line:82%
So, the police are after you.

350
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.810 line:82%
Why?

351
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.520 line:82%
I'm charged with murder.

352
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.030 line:82%
But as usual, the truth is
somewhat different, right!

353
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.490 line:82%
Wrong. The charge is true.

354
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.100 line:82%
What was his name?

355
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:26.830 line:82%
Rajiv.

356
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:29.470 line:82%
He was my sister's husband.

357
00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.250 line:82%
Your sister must have
felt terrible.

358
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.530 line:82%
My sister is dead.

359
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.330 line:82%
He killed her.

360
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.250 line:82%
So, you killed him. Good!

361
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.950 line:82%
What do you want from me?

362
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.760 line:82%
Nothing.

363
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.897 line:82%
Narang saheb said...

364
00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.330 line:82%
...Oh, Narang.

365
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.980 line:82%
Come closer.

366
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.820 line:82%
Come on.

367
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.060 line:82%
You know, what I think?

368
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.840 line:82%
I think...

369
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:12.500 line:82%
I think Narang wants to start
a new sort of "trade" which...

370
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.580 line:82%
Very good.

371
00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.620 line:82%
I like wild cats a lot.

372
00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:31.040 line:82%
Wildcats...

373
00:34:35.789 --> 00:34:36.846 line:82%
What happened?

374
00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:38.207 line:82%
What do you think?

375
00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.969 line:82%
She tried to kill me.

376
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.790 line:82%
Relax, Narang.

377
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.000 line:82%
You will work with us
from today.

378
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.620 line:82%
Thank you, Don.

379
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.540 line:82%
Jairaj called from India.

380
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.940 line:82%
He wants more cocaine.

381
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.760 line:82%
I know.

382
00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.080 line:82%
Did you speak to Jairaj?

383
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.630 line:82%
Yes...

384
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.880 line:82%
I didn't say anything to him. But...

385
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:22.040 line:82%
you are asking for more money
than Mr. Singhania had said.

386
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.000 line:82%
This deal will bring us
millions in profits.

387
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.860 line:82%
Don't you like such
a huge sum?

388
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:34.360 line:82%
It's not that, but it's not your job
to make this decision.

389
00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:36.730 line:82%
It's Mr. Singhania's!

390
00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.460 line:82%
Singhania makes the decision.

391
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.410 line:82%
I do the work.

392
00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.660 line:82%
So, what do you do?

393
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.120 line:82%
I don't talk like a child.

394
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.840 line:82%
Such arrogance isn't good.

395
00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.660 line:82%
Don't forget, this business was
set up by him.

396
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.110 line:82%
Then tell him to come here
and manage it.

397
00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.410 line:82%
What's this?

398
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.540 line:82%
Your wedding DVD!

399
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:06.867 line:82%
This disc has information on all
our business and contacts.

400
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:12.120 line:82%
The next time Mr. Singhania is here,
you can give it to him!

401
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.640 line:82%
Don, I'm not saying your
intentions are wrong.

402
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.160 line:82%
All I'm saying is

403
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.290 line:82%
you're moving very fast.

404
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.530 line:82%
For what I want to achieve,

405
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.450 line:82%
such speed is essential!

406
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.290 line:82%
But turning your friends into
enemies for this quest

407
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.040 line:82%
would be a big mistake.

408
00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.620 line:82%
The biggest mistake Don's
enemy can make

409
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.790 line:82%
is to make an enemy of Don!

410
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.800 line:82%
You have forgotten
what happened yesterday.

411
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:58.650 line:82%
If I ever find out that
your memory has returned,

412
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.640 line:82%
then remember this too:

413
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.250 line:82%
The bullets will be real
next time.

414
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:08.620 line:82%
Yes, Verma.

415
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.700 line:82%
I just got information that
Don is going to India.

416
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.760 line:82%
- When?
- Day after tomorrow.

417
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.850 line:82%
For a deal with
someone named Jairaj.

418
00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.300 line:82%
We'll leave tonight.

419
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.470 line:82%
And find out where
we can find Jairaj.

420
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.090 line:82%
Deepak, come here.

421
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.580 line:82%
It's not nice seeing you
empty-handed, Jairaj.

422
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.737 line:82%
Where's the money?

423
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.020 line:82%
In the car.

424
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.500 line:82%
Hand over the case to me.

425
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.370 line:82%
Nobody says please anymore.

426
00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.230 line:82%
As you like.

427
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:03.840 line:82%
Here you go!

428
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.790 line:82%
Sir, he's driving very fast.

429
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.620 line:82%
Sir, he's very close but
he's moving very fast.

430
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.000 line:82%
Sir, we can't see him any more.

431
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.200 line:82%
Get out of the way, damn it!

432
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680 line:82%
- Sir...
- Come on!

433
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.380 line:82%
Enough. You've run
quite a lot.

434
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.080 line:82%
You!

435
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.370 line:82%
Still angry about the
girl's death, Officer?

436
00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.620 line:82%
Shut up.

437
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.660 line:82%
If you want to shoot

438
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.380 line:82%
go ahead.

439
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.080 line:82%
But don't even think
about arresting me.

440
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.080 line:82%
All right.

441
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.530 line:82%
Have it your way.

442
00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.610 line:82%
Any luck, Verma?

443
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.560 line:82%
No, sir.

444
00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.300 line:82%
This place is so huge that Don
could be hiding anywhere.

445
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.190 line:82%
Sure, but for how long?

446
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.377 line:82%
All highways and stations here
must be put under surveillance.

447
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.700 line:82%
Have our men posted in
nearby hospitals.

448
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:46.100 line:82%
He couldn't escape here
even if he wanted to.

449
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.660 line:82%
- Is that understood?
- Right, Sir.

450
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.400 line:82%
No one knows where Don is
after the police encounter.

451
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.010 line:82%
Not even the police.

452
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.200 line:82%
I'm afraid that Don...

453
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:03.480 line:82%
Don what?

454
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:05.500 line:82%
I think he is dead.

455
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.660 line:82%
Or do you hope he is dead?

456
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.037 line:82%
You know, Mac...

457
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.287 line:82%
I feel that he wanted something
to happen to Don!

458
00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.950 line:82%
- Oh, calm down, Anita.
- No, I will not calm down!

459
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.630 line:82%
What was your
problem with him?

460
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.077 line:82%
Was it that Don had become more
important to Singhania than you?

461
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.257 line:82%
Mac...

462
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.567 line:82%
Take her away from here.

463
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.150 line:82%
I'll go myself.

464
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:27.910 line:82%
But remember...

465
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:30.397 line:82%
If what you're saying
turns out to be true,

466
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.750 line:82%
I'll hold you responsible.

467
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.720 line:82%
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Feroz.

468
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:44.520 line:82%
Feroz!

469
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:46.050 line:82%
Yes, sir?

470
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.780 line:82%
Come here.

471
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:51.790 line:82%
Perhaps you remember.
It was about a year ago...

472
00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.450 line:82%
A man had barged into my office
along with a small boy.

473
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.500 line:82%
The boy's parents
disappeared and

474
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.160 line:82%
he had found him on the street.

475
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.300 line:82%
- I asked you to file the report.
- Yes, Sir.

476
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:05.900 line:82%
Bring me that file.

477
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.300 line:82%
Yes, Sir.

478
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.300 line:82%
Vijay...

479
00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:19.970 line:82%
Every moment, every day

480
00:45:20.741 --> 00:45:25.370 line:82%
Every moment, every day

481
00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:31.270 line:82%
I long for you

482
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.700 line:82%
Oh, Lord!

483
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:42.410 line:82%
You must reveal your glory,
once again

484
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.960 line:82%
You must return next year,
once again

485
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.330 line:82%
You must reveal your glory,
once again

486
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.660 line:82%
You must return next year,
once again

487
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.340 line:82%
I will wait for you
with longing eyes

488
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.660 line:82%
Heed me, heed my plea

489
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.147 line:82%
Come back again

490
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.060 line:82%
Hear your devotee's plea

491
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.230 line:82%
Only when I look upon you

492
00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.370 line:82%
will my heart be at peace

493
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.730 line:82%
Lord o' mine

494
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.040 line:82%
Dear Lord o' mine!

495
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:03.370 line:82%
Be it happy times
or days of sorrow

496
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.620 line:82%
Our hearts chant
just one name

497
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:16.440 line:82%
Because of you,
life is comfortable

498
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:20.320 line:82%
You dwell in our
whole being

499
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.870 line:82%
Every second

500
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.910 line:82%
I think of you

501
00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.370 line:82%
I am your fan

502
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.700 line:82%
I chant your name
in prayer

503
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:32.190 line:82%
Heed me,
heed my plea

504
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:34.330 line:82%
Come back again

505
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.957 line:82%
Hear your devotee's plea

506
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.870 line:82%
Only when I look upon you

507
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.040 line:82%
will my heart be at peace

508
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.580 line:82%
Lord o' mine

509
00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.750 line:82%
Dear Lord o' mine!

510
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:02.410 line:82%
You must reveal your glory,
once again

511
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.830 line:82%
You must return next year,
once again

512
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.790 line:82%
One, two, three, four!

513
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.750 line:82%
Hail Lord Ganesha's glory!

514
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.110 line:82%
Five, Six, Seven, Eight!

515
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:24.450 line:82%
Lord Ganesha is with us!

516
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.080 line:82%
Lord o' mine, Ganpati!

517
00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.080 line:82%
May the next year
bring you soon!

518
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.910 line:82%
Is it fresh?

519
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.910 line:82%
Here you go, Deepu.

520
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.137 line:82%
Done counting?

521
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.237 line:82%
Yes, Uncle.

522
00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.750 line:82%
How much is it? Grand total?

523
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.660 line:82%
3000 Rupees, including the
last three days.

524
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.557 line:82%
Yuck! What are you doing?

525
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.160 line:82%
Sorry, very much.

526
00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.410 line:82%
What is the world coming to?

527
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.777 line:82%
My voice has gone hoarse singing
for three days and what do we get?

528
00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.580 line:82%
3000 Rupees!

529
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.317 line:82%
- Don't worry, Uncle Vijay.
- How can I not!

530
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.630 line:82%
We'll make a lot of money over
the nine days of Navratri festival.

531
00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.540 line:82%
Wow, Deepu...

532
00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.950 line:82%
We'll have to make money.

533
00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:57.620 line:82%
I worry constantly about enrolling
you into a good school.

534
00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:59.950 line:82%
I just want you to
pass high school!

535
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.317 line:82%
But what can I do?

536
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:05.910 line:82%
There's no money left
after rent and stuff, is there?

537
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.410 line:82%
Hey, don't feel sad.

538
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.500 line:82%
Imagine what your Daddy
would say if he met me?

539
00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:19.080 line:82%
"Why, thank you! You've put my son
on the streets!" Isn't that right?

540
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.307 line:82%
You don't know my dad.
He'd never ever say that.

541
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:25.987 line:82%
Really! Then what would he say?

542
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.137 line:82%
Vijay...

543
00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.227 line:82%
How would he know my name?!

544
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:30.327 line:82%
Vijay!

545
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:31.780 line:82%
I don't want ice cream.
Please go!

546
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.580 line:82%
I'm not selling ice cream!

547
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.050 line:82%
DCP saheb.

548
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:47.500 line:82%
I consider myself pretty smart.

549
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:49.580 line:82%
Actually I am.

550
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.457 line:82%
But when you're keeping things
even from your own department,

551
00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.250 line:82%
why tell me?

552
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.000 line:82%
I mean, this Don...

553
00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.450 line:82%
What's he got to do with me?

554
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.620 line:82%
Look at this first.

555
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.347 line:82%
You'll understand everything.

556
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:09.480 line:82%
Okay.

557
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:13.660 line:82%
This is me!

558
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.080 line:82%
You're joking, aren't you?

559
00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.350 line:82%
No.

560
00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:21.370 line:82%
No, you're not joking!

561
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.160 line:82%
So, then?

562
00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:29.330 line:82%
In that case I'm feeling

563
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:36.450 line:82%
like you want me to
take Don's place?

564
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.677 line:82%
Yes.

565
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.120 line:82%
Don't mind please.

566
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.443 line:82%
Okay.

567
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.660 line:82%
You just told me

568
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.660 line:82%
Don killed
one of your informants.

569
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.870 line:82%
To say yes to this job
after hearing all this....

570
00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.410 line:82%
you get what I'm saying?

571
00:51:58.690 --> 00:51:59.830 line:82%
DCP saheb.

572
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.940 line:82%
Look at Don! He uses his
gun without thinking twice...

573
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.330 line:82%
and me?

574
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.250 line:82%
Forget a gun!

575
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.660 line:82%
I can't even use a bicycle!

576
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:12.020 line:82%
Vijay, I agree this job
is dangerous.

577
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.800 line:82%
You don't say?

578
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.790 line:82%
But if we plan
each move carefully

579
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:19.330 line:82%
it can be easily done.

580
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.410 line:82%
Sure, sure.

581
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:26.660 line:82%
Sir, I'm not afraid of jumping
into this well,

582
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.870 line:82%
but, you tell me...

583
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:33.200 line:82%
If something happens to me?

584
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.790 line:82%
Where will Deepu go?

585
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.160 line:82%
I understand, Vijay.

586
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:46.580 line:82%
You must understand.

587
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.790 line:82%
The people I want to catch
with your help

588
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:56.500 line:82%
find it easiest to get kids,
like Deepu, hooked onto drugs.

589
00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.500 line:82%
God forbid, if tomorrow

590
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.450 line:82%
he gets addicted to this poison,

591
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:06.160 line:82%
how would you forgive yourself?

592
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.910 line:82%
Look Vijay. If you agree,

593
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:21.540 line:82%
I'll take full responsibility for
this boy's education.

594
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.540 line:82%
It will give Deepu the choice
to be whatever he wants.

595
00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:30.120 line:82%
A doctor, an engineer...
or a police officer like me.

596
00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:36.290 line:82%
All this is possible if you want it.

597
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.160 line:82%
Okay, DCP saheb

598
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:48.830 line:82%
But tell me something...

599
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:52.950 line:82%
If Don's gang finds me out
and you find me in a coffin,

600
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:58.250 line:82%
Deepu's name won't be cut from
the school register, will it?

601
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.620 line:82%
Deepu's education will be
looked after.

602
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.100 line:82%
I promise.

603
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:03.950 line:82%
Okay, okay.

604
00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.250 line:82%
One more question.

605
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:11.000 line:82%
The fact that I am Vijay,

606
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:13.580 line:82%
and not Don...

607
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:17.000 line:82%
You alone will know that, right?

608
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:21.620 line:82%
May God give you a long life,
but what if you kick it?

609
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:25.227 line:82%
I mean...

610
00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:27.580 line:82%
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me.

611
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:20.870 line:82%
Stop, Dad.

612
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.847 line:82%
Where's Mom?

613
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.237 line:82%
Making breakfast.

614
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.237 line:82%
And she sent you as her
alarm clock, did she?

615
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.577 line:82%
Well, where's the button to
switch this alarm off?

616
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:31.750 line:82%
No....

617
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:44.457 line:82%
Thank you, sir.

618
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.990 line:82%
So... what's the problem?

619
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:47.910 line:82%
Just a moment, sir.

620
00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:53.950 line:82%
Sir, is this the password
you entered?

621
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.080 line:82%
That's the one.

622
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.720 line:82%
F09AK74

623
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:02.660 line:82%
If you remember, while installing
the program, I told you that

624
00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:07.830 line:82%
the password recorded in this folder will
be shown backwards for security reasons

625
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:09.600 line:82%
So your actual password is

626
00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.540 line:82%
47KA90F

627
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.770 line:82%
Oh, God! Yes, I'm sorry.

628
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.540 line:82%
Will that be all, sir?

629
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.660 line:82%
Stop right here!

630
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:41.950 line:82%
Is anybody there?!

631
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:48.660 line:82%
Hello, Jasjit.

632
00:56:48.851 --> 00:56:50.290 line:82%
I hope you are comfortable.

633
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:52.877 line:82%
Who is this?

634
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.200 line:82%
The man who can rescue you.

635
00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:57.220 line:82%
But you'll have to
do me a small favor!

636
00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:01.237 line:82%
This is a strange way of asking
someone for a favor!

637
00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.700 line:82%
I like you, Jasjit.

638
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:04.450 line:82%
Tell me something...

639
00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:08.830 line:82%
Isn't it true that Joshi's computer
alone can unlock his safe?

640
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.187 line:82%
I don't know.

641
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:12.410 line:82%
Oh, really!

642
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:15.250 line:82%
That means you were lying
to Joshi.

643
00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:17.580 line:82%
Or are you lying to me?

644
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.250 line:82%
Look.

645
00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.540 line:82%
Think what you want.

646
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.700 line:82%
But just get me out of here.

647
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.657 line:82%
Why?

648
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.370 line:82%
Is it very suffocating?

649
00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:33.500 line:82%
If you want, we can send your
wife, Geeta, to be with you.

650
00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.370 line:82%
Take it easy, Jasjit. Relax!

651
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.410 line:82%
All you need to do is one job.

652
00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.840 line:82%
There are 10 million dollars in diamonds
in Joshi's safe.

653
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.370 line:82%
Get them and I'll release her.

654
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000 line:82%
I want to talk to Geeta.

655
00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:57.660 line:82%
Of course.

656
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.500 line:82%
- Jasjit.
- Geeta.

657
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.750 line:82%
I am so sorry, Geeta.

658
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:09.660 line:82%
This is all my fault.

659
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:11.580 line:82%
Forgive me.

660
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.500 line:82%
I love you.

661
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.180 line:82%
I love you, too.

662
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.040 line:82%
That's very sweet, but I've got diabetes.

663
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.790 line:82%
Now lets talk business.

664
00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.660 line:82%
The diamond company
Joshi works for

665
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:27.870 line:82%
is on the 25th floor
of Belcourt Towers.

666
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:31.943 line:82%
The security throughout the floor is
the kind required to safeguard

667
00:58:32.026 --> 00:58:33.740 line:82%
10 million in diamonds.

668
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:39.120 line:82%
We can get you to the roof
via the service lift.

669
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.370 line:82%
The rest is up to you.

670
01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:27.467 line:82%
Hold it.

671
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:28.720 line:82%
Right there!

672
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.500 line:82%
Take the bag off your shoulder
and put it down.

673
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.430 line:82%
You must be wondering how
the police got here.

674
01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.030 line:82%
I'll tell you.

675
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:46.280 line:82%
Mrs. Wadia lives in the
building across the road.

676
01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.500 line:82%
She and her husband
quarrel pretty often

677
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:54.290 line:82%
and the poor lady comes out
to her balcony to calm down.

678
01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.830 line:82%
Guess what she saw
from her balcony tonight?

679
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:04.950 line:82%
Inspector D'Silva, please listen
to me very carefully.

680
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:08.040 line:82%
I'm being forced to do this.

681
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:11.370 line:82%
Some people have kidnapped my wife.

682
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:12.900 line:82%
You think I am a fool?

683
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.830 line:82%
What's your name?

684
01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.760 line:82%
Jasjit.

685
01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:21.910 line:82%
You're under arrest.

686
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.510 line:82%
Shinde.

687
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.200 line:82%
Jasjit, stop!

688
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.210 line:82%
Inspector!

689
01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.660 line:82%
They will kill my wife!
I must go. Do you understand?

690
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.620 line:82%
I'm telling the truth!

691
01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.600 line:82%
Maybe...

692
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:16.750 line:82%
But I am not authorized
to sympathize with you.

693
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:20.080 line:82%
Take him away.

694
01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.830 line:82%
Any idea where Deepu is?

695
01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.080 line:82%
D'Silva...

696
01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:01.200 line:82%
Your days are numbered!

697
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.120 line:82%
Wow! Isn't this something?!
He's handsome!

698
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:23.620 line:82%
You know, Sir, seeing a picture is
one thing. To be face to face like this...

699
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:27.540 line:82%
Don is alive, isn't he?

700
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.080 line:82%
Yes.

701
01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:32.120 line:82%
The doctors have kept him in
a sedated state.

702
01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:36.520 line:82%
I personally believe that a person
like Don has no right to live.

703
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.540 line:82%
But I need him now.

704
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:43.950 line:82%
Vijay, I want you to study
him properly.

705
01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.587 line:82%
Understand him.

706
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:48.607 line:82%
Learn his habits,
his mannerisms, everything!

707
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:51.080 line:82%
I will learn everything.
What's the big deal?

708
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:53.410 line:82%
Let him wake up at least!

709
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:58.950 line:82%
As soon as your work is done,
I'll hand him over to the police.

710
01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.410 line:82%
I get it.

711
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.433 line:82%
First...

712
01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.790 line:82%
All the marks and scars on Don's body

713
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.667 line:82%
need to be put on yours.

714
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:09.790 line:82%
Sure.

715
01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:11.730 line:82%
On me?!

716
01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.770 line:82%
Yes.

717
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.950 line:82%
The doctors here can
do it painlessly.

718
01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.830 line:82%
How can it be painless?!

719
01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:32.540 line:82%
Hi, Ashok.

720
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.750 line:82%
He's all yours.

721
01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:36.980 line:82%
Vijay, this is Dr. Ashok Khilwani.

722
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.580 line:82%
He will operate on you.

723
01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.577 line:82%
Everything ready as planned?

724
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.790 line:82%
Yes, just a few
preliminary tests and

725
01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.410 line:82%
we are ready to get started.

726
01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.787 line:82%
I'll check everything.

727
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:49.950 line:82%
Thanks, Ashok.

728
01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.700 line:82%
What's the matter?

729
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.053 line:82%
I've never heard of a bullet mark on a
shoulder, or

730
01:05:01.136 --> 01:05:03.660 line:82%
a scar on the head being made painlessly.

731
01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.750 line:82%
- Don't be afraid.
- How can I not be!!

732
01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:08.620 line:82%
I was about to tell you,

733
01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:12.870 line:82%
I got Deepu admitted to
Malaysia's International School.

734
01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:14.910 line:82%
Inter... Int...

735
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:17.697 line:82%
With that name, it must be good.

736
01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.207 line:82%
- It's one of the best.
- Best.

737
01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:22.197 line:82%
Now, stop worrying about Deepu
and concentrate on your work.

738
01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.390 line:82%
Okay, okay.

739
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:29.200 line:82%
Look, I'll tell you all I know
about Don.

740
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.500 line:82%
Besides that, I've thought of
another plan.

741
01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:36.000 line:82%
As Don, that means you

742
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:41.580 line:82%
will go back to your companions
ill and wounded.

743
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.330 line:82%
You will have lost your memory.

744
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.500 line:82%
The more you learn about
Don's life...

745
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:54.257 line:82%
...The closer I'll get to
regaining my memory.

746
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.690 line:82%
Thank you.

747
01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.980 line:82%
You think exactly like the
comic book hero, Chacha Chaudhary!

748
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:01.140 line:82%
You Know Chacha?

749
01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.370 line:82%
Brain working faster
than a computer.

750
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.840 line:82%
I'll tell you a
great story. Listen...

751
01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:11.260 line:82%
One day, Chacha Chaudhary took
his dog, Rocket, out for stroll.

752
01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.710 line:82%
You want it?

753
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.700 line:82%
- Don never ate paan (betel leaf).
- Never ate paan!!

754
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.870 line:82%
That wasn't very
nice of him, was it!

755
01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.330 line:82%
Well, I guess that
I must quit too.

756
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:27.250 line:82%
Fine.

757
01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.870 line:82%
Come on, Vijay.

758
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.370 line:82%
Are those binoculars?

759
01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.277 line:82%
- Neha...
- Yes, Doctor?

760
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:41.367 line:82%
Start monitoring his blood pressure.

761
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:42.760 line:82%
- Why?
- Yes, Sir.

762
01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.457 line:82%
Anand, patch me through the face match.

763
01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:46.787 line:82%
Doctor, sir...

764
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.870 line:82%
It won't be too painful, will it?

765
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:53.130 line:82%
No, it...

766
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.330 line:82%
How long, before he comes?

767
01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.660 line:82%
Well, just another 48 hours, Mr. D'Silva,
and then he's all yours.

768
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.580 line:82%
Good job, Ashok.

769
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:11.330 line:82%
Doctor, please come immediately
to room no. 2.

770
01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:12.540 line:82%
It's an emergency.

771
01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.028 line:82%
- My God!
- What happened Ashok?

772
01:07:15.111 --> 01:07:16.360 line:82%
Don's admitted to that room.

773
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:18.177 line:82%
What happened?

774
01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.456 line:82%
- Heart seizure, Doctor.
- Have you given him anything

775
01:07:20.539 --> 01:07:22.417 line:82%
- to stabilize him?
- Yes, 2ml of adrenaline.

776
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.320 line:82%
Get me a cardiac injection, quick.

777
01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:26.980 line:82%
- What's his blood pressure?
- 210 over 120 doctor.

778
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:28.270 line:82%
I said, "Hurry up."

779
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.250 line:82%
No.

780
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:34.720 line:82%
God damn it!

781
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.340 line:82%
Ashok,

782
01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:51.500 line:82%
you and your team know
nothing about this incident.

783
01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:54.250 line:82%
This operation never happened.

784
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.870 line:82%
Is that understood?

785
01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:57.940 line:82%
Okay.

786
01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:03.000 line:82%
The success of my plan depends on
this secret remaining a secret.

787
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.430 line:82%
Ashok,

788
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.970 line:82%
it's only a matter of a few days.

789
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.029 line:82%
Hello?

790
01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:55.569 line:82%
Yes.

791
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:58.370 line:82%
Where have you seen him?

792
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.979 line:82%
- Where did you see him?
- Over there.

793
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.040 line:82%
The doctors are saying he lost his memory.

794
01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.450 line:82%
He doesn't remember anything.

795
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.120 line:82%
Still, we must get him back
at any cost.

796
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:24.970 line:82%
You're right, but how?

797
01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:28.540 line:82%
The passport they found in his
car was Malaysian,

798
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.290 line:82%
so they must send Don back.

799
01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.939 line:82%
Don't worry, Mr. Singhania.

800
01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.160 line:82%
It will be done.

801
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:26.600 line:82%
Go back!

802
01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.310 line:82%
Welcome back, Don.

803
01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.590 line:82%
That's right.

804
01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.990 line:82%
Your name is Don.

805
01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.250 line:82%
I am Narang.

806
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:28.370 line:82%
She is Roma.

807
01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:33.160 line:82%
All of us here work with you,
and you work for Mr. Singhania.

808
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:36.290 line:82%
You remember Mr. Singhania
at least?

809
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:10.410 line:82%
I don't believe it!

810
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:14.580 line:82%
In spite of all the security,
they took Don away!

811
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.930 line:82%
Don's testimony could have
exposed the entire crime ring.

812
01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:28.880 line:82%
But what can he tell us when he
doesn't remember anything?

813
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.620 line:82%
I don't think he's of any use
to them now either.

814
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:34.110 line:82%
Who is "them"?

815
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:41.120 line:82%
Mr. Malik, whoever did this either
works for Singhania or for his enemy.

816
01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:43.800 line:82%
- Like who?
- Like...

817
01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.200 line:82%
Vardhaan.

818
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:49.040 line:82%
Vardhaan...

819
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:50.950 line:82%
Where is Vardhaan?!!

820
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.200 line:82%
Have you seen him?

821
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:55.160 line:82%
Do you know where he's hiding?

822
01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.080 line:82%
Do we even have a single
picture of him?

823
01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.870 line:82%
No.

824
01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:02.290 line:82%
Please.

825
01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:06.840 line:82%
And by the way, Mr. D'Silva.

826
01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:11.000 line:82%
Memory isn't something that,
once lost, can't be found.

827
01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:13.620 line:82%
It's just a matter of time.

828
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:19.950 line:82%
Is this

829
01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:22.180 line:82%
mine?

830
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.960 line:82%
Yes.

831
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.970 line:82%
For me, Don isn't Don

832
01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:31.450 line:82%
without this.

833
01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.300 line:82%
How do I look?

834
01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.410 line:82%
You look very dangerous.

835
01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.990 line:82%
Mr. Mallik,

836
01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.940 line:82%
It's been three weeks since
Don's escape.

837
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:02.160 line:82%
Why can't the police catch him?

838
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:05.367 line:82%
You tell us where he is and
we'll go catch him!

839
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:06.457 line:82%
Please, Mr. Malik

840
01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:10.457 line:82%
Look, until we get the right
information, or a witness comes forward,

841
01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.850 line:82%
We must follow police procedure.

842
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.410 line:82%
What's in it?

843
01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:32.200 line:82%
Our contacts, bank account numbers
and passwords are all recorded in this.

844
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.750 line:82%
You made it yourself
and put it in the safe.

845
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:40.450 line:82%
Yes.

846
01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.090 line:82%
Yes, Vijay. Tell me.

847
01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:51.410 line:82%
D'Silva saheb.

848
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:55.370 line:82%
I know enough about Don

849
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:58.790 line:82%
for my memory to now return.

850
01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.280 line:82%
Good.

851
01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.750 line:82%
We must do this with utmost care.

852
01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.410 line:82%
I agree.

853
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.830 line:82%
If you can't lose your
memory without reason,

854
01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:13.040 line:82%
then it shouldn't come back
without reason either.

855
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.890 line:82%
I've got a solution for that.

856
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.750 line:82%
Tomorrow, make some excuse

857
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:20.560 line:82%
and come to the place I've arranged.

858
01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.590 line:82%
Who are you waiting for?

859
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:38.250 line:82%
Maybe... you.

860
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.580 line:82%
Oh, that.

861
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.830 line:82%
You have done a lot for me.

862
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:55.790 line:82%
I won't forget that.

863
01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.370 line:82%
There's a lot more left to do.

864
01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:05.280 line:82%
That there is.

865
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:03.880 line:82%
Don!

866
01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.130 line:82%
It was like this the
other day too.

867
01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:19.540 line:82%
I was in my car

868
01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.830 line:82%
and the police were chasing me.

869
01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.040 line:82%
They were shooting at me.

870
01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:27.890 line:82%
And then I...

871
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:33.000 line:82%
I remember everything.

872
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:34.900 line:82%
Who I am!

873
01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.800 line:82%
Who all of you are!

874
01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.810 line:82%
I remember each
and every thing!

875
01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.050 line:82%
Mac...

876
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:44.160 line:82%
Remembering your friends'
names is one thing.

877
01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.790 line:82%
In our business, it's important to
remember our enemy's name.

878
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.480 line:82%
Which enemy are you
talking about, Narang?

879
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.330 line:82%
Vardhaan or that Officer D'Silva?

880
01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.200 line:82%
Maybe T.J. is the one you
were thinking about.

881
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.620 line:82%
Or the man who betrayed
us all, Ramesh?

882
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.290 line:82%
I really enjoyed killing them all.

883
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.120 line:82%
- This calls for a celebration.
- Oh yes, it does.

884
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.040 line:82%
I am back.

885
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.700 line:82%
The people in this world

886
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.810 line:82%
have clutched their hearts
again!

887
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:14.870 line:82%
I have returned

888
01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.790 line:82%
bringing back with me

889
01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:20.620 line:82%
a lot of excitement!

890
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.370 line:82%
Look who’s here

891
01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:36.450 line:82%
Back to rule your world

892
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:40.450 line:82%
Who's got you mesmerized?

893
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:44.330 line:82%
For whom do you wait
with open arms?

894
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:49.950 line:82%
Who is this charming man?

895
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:55.910 line:82%
Recognize me

896
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:59.000 line:82%
I am Don

897
01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:22.750 line:82%
I bid my life

898
01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:26.790 line:82%
and gamble with death

899
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:28.830 line:82%
I have no regret

900
01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:30.750 line:82%
nor do I care

901
01:21:31.450 --> 01:21:34.450 line:82%
who I make my enemy

902
01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:38.450 line:82%
No enemy of mine

903
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:46.500 line:82%
will live too long

904
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:50.120 line:82%
I am very dangerous

905
01:21:56.870 --> 01:22:00.080 line:82%
I am very dangerous

906
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:03.950 line:82%
and forever cunning

907
01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:09.400 line:82%
Who is back to win
the world over?

908
01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.247 line:82%
Recognize me

909
01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:19.910 line:82%
I am Don

910
01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:04.830 line:82%
Their eyes inviting

911
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:10.660 line:82%
Many women have
wanted me for themselves

912
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:12.830 line:82%
But these two eyes

913
01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:14.910 line:82%
that are glancing into mine

914
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.160 line:82%
have mesmerized me

915
01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.500 line:82%
These eyes

916
01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:25.000 line:82%
tell me

917
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.870 line:82%
that they are hiding
an intoxicating secret

918
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:33.370 line:82%
I am getting addicted to them

919
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:43.750 line:82%
I am getting addicted to them

920
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:47.870 line:82%
and my heart is falling
under its spell

921
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:53.870 line:82%
Who is here that has
fallen under this spell?

922
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:59.750 line:82%
Recognize me

923
01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:03.910 line:82%
I am Don

924
01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:32.880 line:82%
Yes, Vijay?

925
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.540 line:82%
A deal is on at seven tomorrow morning,
outside the city.

926
01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:39.410 line:82%
If you can get there,

927
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:43.410 line:82%
I’ll bring the disc with me.

928
01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:46.740 line:82%
I'm sure

929
01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.910 line:82%
it has all the information
the police want.

930
01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:52.750 line:82%
Can you go there alone?

931
01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.700 line:82%
Rest assured.

932
01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.450 line:82%
There’ll be no one with me.

933
01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:49.340 line:82%
Mr. Narang, don’t you think it’s
unsafe for Don to go alone?

934
01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.410 line:82%
I mean, this deal could
also be a setup.

935
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:55.910 line:82%
Don won’t go alone.

936
01:25:58.450 --> 01:25:59.600 line:82%
You will go with him.

937
01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:01.250 line:82%
Don't be silly, Narang.

938
01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:05.410 line:82%
Are you telling me that
I can’t do this job alone?

939
01:26:07.450 --> 01:26:09.790 line:82%
No. I know that you can
do it alone.

940
01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.950 line:82%
But Mr. Singhania has personally
ordered me to do this.

941
01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:15.867 line:82%
Mr. Narang...

942
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:18.330 line:82%
Can't Vikram or Mac
do this job?

943
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:20.830 line:82%
Why is it important for Roma
to go with Don?

944
01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:23.830 line:82%
Because Mr. Narang knows me very well.

945
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:29.000 line:82%
And when, where and
who to shoot

946
01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.330 line:82%
is something I know very well.

947
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:11.000 line:82%
Singhania,

948
01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.080 line:82%
your time is up.

949
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.330 line:82%
Tomorrow, the disc will be mine
and you’ll be finished!

950
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.580 line:82%
Tomorrow…!

951
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:28.700 line:82%
This one word separates me
from my success.

952
01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:37.540 line:82%
And don't worry.

953
01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:41.620 line:82%
The police will never find out
that I have the disc.

954
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.290 line:82%
Because they don't know
that I am Vardhaan.

955
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.830 line:82%
Nor is my photograph in
any of their records.

956
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:03.467 line:82%
Is this a joke?!

957
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:04.777 line:82%
No, its not!

958
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.917 line:82%
What is this madness?

959
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.340 line:82%
I have felt this mad since

960
01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.420 line:82%
you killed my brother, Ramesh,
and his fiancée.

961
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:14.340 line:82%
Ramesh! Your brother?

962
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:15.670 line:82%
Yes.

963
01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:19.210 line:82%
And I didn’t kill you
until now because

964
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:22.420 line:82%
I wanted you to remember
why you were being killed!

965
01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.020 line:82%
You don’t know this, but

966
01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.800 line:82%
I didn’t kill your brother.

967
01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:28.750 line:82%
Goodbye, Don.

968
01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:21.300 line:82%
Stop! That’s enough.

969
01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.800 line:82%
Look! Look at me.

970
01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.000 line:82%
Listen carefully.

971
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:28.417 line:82%
You didn't kill me these past few days.

972
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500 line:82%
And for that, I thank you.

973
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:34.250 line:82%
Now listen to the truth.

974
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:36.960 line:82%
The truth is…

975
01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:40.630 line:82%
The truth is…

976
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:42.380 line:82%
He...

977
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.140 line:82%
is not Don.

978
01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:55.550 line:82%
Who can say that
he is not Don!

979
01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:58.210 line:82%
Besides Vijay and me now,

980
01:30:59.110 --> 01:31:00.710 line:82%
only you know the truth.

981
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.290 line:82%
Where is the disc?

982
01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.460 line:82%
Vijay.

983
01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:23.777 line:82%
I'm sorry.

984
01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.000 line:82%
I thought that...

985
01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:26.690 line:82%
No, it doesn’t matter.

986
01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:29.750 line:82%
Anyone in your place

987
01:31:31.130 --> 01:31:32.290 line:82%
would have been deceived.

988
01:31:35.210 --> 01:31:36.300 line:82%
Mr. D'Silva,

989
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.050 line:82%
your work is done?

990
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:39.300 line:82%
No.

991
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.460 line:82%
My work isn’t done yet.

992
01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.797 line:82%
That too will happen.

993
01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:47.320 line:82%
Singhania is coming here.

994
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:49.930 line:82%
Singhania?

995
01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:51.507 line:82%
Yes, Sir.

996
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:53.760 line:82%
He is coming to Kuala Lumpur
for a meeting.

997
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:57.300 line:82%
I’ll inform you of the location
as soon as I know.

998
01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.790 line:82%
Good.

999
01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:02.940 line:82%
Vijay,

1000
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:06.250 line:82%
you may have done this
for Deepu’s sake, but

1001
01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:12.670 line:82%
neither me nor the police
will ever forget this favor.

1002
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:15.670 line:82%
Who is Deepu?

1003
01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:30.350 line:82%
Uncle Vijay!

1004
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:40.300 line:82%
Don’t you recognize me?

1005
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:43.670 line:82%
How could I not recognize you?

1006
01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:45.300 line:82%
My... Deepu!

1007
01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.460 line:82%
But, honestly,

1008
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:49.687 line:82%
for one second I did wonder,

1009
01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:52.540 line:82%
"Who is this smart young gentleman
running towards me?"

1010
01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:54.630 line:82%
This new uniform!

1011
01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:56.290 line:82%
New shoes.

1012
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:59.000 line:82%
Well, Uncle, you aren’t the
same either!

1013
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.250 line:82%
What can I say, Deepu?

1014
01:33:03.130 --> 01:33:04.420 line:82%
Your Uncle Vijay

1015
01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.360 line:82%
had to change.

1016
01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:07.777 line:82%
But what about your paan?

1017
01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:09.590 line:82%
Paan is gone!

1018
01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:11.297 line:82%
Just a minute.

1019
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:12.770 line:82%
Roma, this is Deepu.

1020
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:14.417 line:82%
Hi Deepu.

1021
01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:15.630 line:82%
Nice to meet you.

1022
01:33:16.170 --> 01:33:17.450 line:82%
Hello, me too.

1023
01:33:17.630 --> 01:33:19.630 line:82%
And Deepu, this is Aunty Roma.

1024
01:33:20.050 --> 01:33:25.840 line:82%
- Uncle, is she your aunty too?
- Hey! Is that any way to speak!

1025
01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.510 line:82%
Vijay.

1026
01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:33.800 line:82%
The things you do for that boy!

1027
01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:37.380 line:82%
Who does this in today's age?

1028
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.600 line:82%
Had anything happened to you today,

1029
01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:44.750 line:82%
I'd never have forgiven myself!

1030
01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:47.590 line:82%
Please forget all about it.

1031
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:51.810 line:82%
Anyway,

1032
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:53.370 line:82%
I don’t know.

1033
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:58.090 line:82%
Should I be grateful to Don for
making it possible to meet you

1034
01:33:59.210 --> 01:34:01.000 line:82%
Or should I hate him?

1035
01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:04.020 line:82%
Because, I wonder

1036
01:34:05.170 --> 01:34:07.630 line:82%
how you could even sit beside a man

1037
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:11.500 line:82%
who constantly reminds you
of your brother’s death.

1038
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:18.630 line:82%
I can’t punish you for a crime
committed by someone else.

1039
01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:24.110 line:82%
And please,

1040
01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.580 line:82%
Stop addressing me so formally.

1041
01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.750 line:82%
What do I call you then?

1042
01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.460 line:82%
Aunty?

1043
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:54.790 line:82%
Excuse me...

1044
01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:57.027 line:82%
Hello?

1045
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:59.750 line:82%
There is a Mr. Jasjit Ahuja
here to see you, sir.

1046
01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.880 line:82%
Jasjit...

1047
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:03.840 line:82%
Jasjit...

1048
01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:11.550 line:82%
- How are you, Haatim?
- Very well.

1049
01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:13.960 line:82%
What a surprise!

1050
01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.187 line:82%
My God, it’s been ages!

1051
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:17.320 line:82%
Banglore 2002.

1052
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:19.300 line:82%
Before you came here.

1053
01:35:20.190 --> 01:35:21.270 line:82%
Really!

1054
01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:22.840 line:82%
How time flies!

1055
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:24.630 line:82%
Unbelievable!

1056
01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.540 line:82%
What brings you here?

1057
01:35:27.630 --> 01:35:29.960 line:82%
DCP D'Silva is in this city right now.

1058
01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:35.460 line:82%
Yes.

1059
01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:38.710 line:82%
I heard about what happened to you.

1060
01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.990 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1061
01:35:42.090 --> 01:35:43.480 line:82%
I couldn’t do anything for you.

1062
01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:45.250 line:82%
But you can now.

1063
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:47.720 line:82%
I want his address, Haatim.

1064
01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.960 line:82%
What do you plan on doing?

1065
01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:54.420 line:82%
What time is the meeting?

1066
01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.040 line:82%
And Singhania will be there?

1067
01:35:59.270 --> 01:36:00.507 line:82%
Good, I'll see you then.

1068
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:01.600 line:82%
Vijay...

1069
01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:03.790 line:82%
Well done!

1070
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:56.710 line:82%
Welcome back!

1071
01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:02.360 line:82%
Perhaps you don’t know who I am?

1072
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.590 line:82%
I know you very well.

1073
01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:06.630 line:82%
DCP D'Silva.

1074
01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:10.500 line:82%
Who are you?

1075
01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:12.380 line:82%
Think back!

1076
01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:14.840 line:82%
January 9th , Belcourt Towers?

1077
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:18.560 line:82%
10 million dollars in diamonds?

1078
01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:20.060 line:82%
No?

1079
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:23.757 line:82%
Well, maybe a bullet could help
sharpen your memory.

1080
01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:24.990 line:82%
Hang on!

1081
01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:30.090 line:82%
Jasjit?

1082
01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.040 line:82%
Yes.

1083
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:33.590 line:82%
Jasjit.

1084
01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:35.800 line:82%
What do you want?

1085
01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.380 line:82%
I want to kill you!

1086
01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:43.460 line:82%
I hope you won't mind too much!

1087
01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:44.880 line:82%
Look, Jasjit…

1088
01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.380 line:82%
Maybe what happened to you was wrong.

1089
01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:50.720 line:82%
I was only doing my duty.

1090
01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:52.920 line:82%
I’m a police officer.

1091
01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.540 line:82%
And right now it’s crucial
for me to be somewhere.

1092
01:37:57.630 --> 01:38:00.000 line:82%
Or else some big criminals
will get away.

1093
01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.520 line:82%
Let me go!

1094
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:04.880 line:82%
How can I let you go?

1095
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.090 line:82%
Look at these faces!

1096
01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:11.460 line:82%
One of them is my wife

1097
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:14.210 line:82%
who is dead because of you.

1098
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.090 line:82%
The other is my innocent son!

1099
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:18.920 line:82%
Who knows where he is now!

1100
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:20.870 line:82%
Look at them.

1101
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:26.720 line:82%
This boy.

1102
01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:29.790 line:82%
Deepu…

1103
01:38:31.630 --> 01:38:33.000 line:82%
Is your son?!

1104
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:37.670 line:82%
You know Deepu?

1105
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.590 line:82%
Yes. I also know where he is.

1106
01:38:41.230 --> 01:38:43.920 line:82%
But I will only tell you that
after I come back.

1107
01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:48.627 line:82%
Wrong!

1108
01:38:48.710 --> 01:38:50.300 line:82%
You will tell me right now!

1109
01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.840 line:82%
Jasjit...

1110
01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.090 line:82%
You can kill me and have your revenge.

1111
01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.500 line:82%
But then you'll give up all hope
of seeing your son again!

1112
01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:13.090 line:82%
I don’t hate you as much

1113
01:39:14.710 --> 01:39:16.920 line:82%
as I love my son.

1114
01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:18.960 line:82%
Go.

1115
01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:21.840 line:82%
I will wait for you here.

1116
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:27.960 line:82%
Leave that here.

1117
01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:31.410 line:82%
You do have to come back,
don't you?

1118
01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:46.920 line:82%
Night and wine have met
we are intoxicated

1119
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:54.380 line:82%
Body and heart
are both ready to melt

1120
01:40:56.150 --> 01:41:00.800 line:82%
Celebration surrounds us

1121
01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:08.340 line:82%
but yet I am anxious

1122
01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:12.270 line:82%
Why does my heart beat faster?

1123
01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:15.960 line:82%
Why does my heart say

1124
01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:22.300 line:82%
You fools do not know
this yet?

1125
01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.210 line:82%
Tonight

1126
01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:28.130 line:82%
Who knows what will happen?

1127
01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:32.960 line:82%
What will we gain?

1128
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:36.290 line:82%
What will we lose?

1129
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:39.340 line:82%
Tonight

1130
01:41:40.590 --> 01:41:42.170 line:82%
Who knows what will happen?

1131
01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:47.050 line:82%
What will we gain?

1132
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:50.000 line:82%
What will we lose?

1133
01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:14.960 line:82%
What will happen
in just a few moments?

1134
01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.960 line:82%
What was always mine
will be mine again

1135
01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:28.960 line:82%
The night will decide
who resides in whose heart

1136
01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.750 line:82%
The decision has been made

1137
01:42:33.630 --> 01:42:36.420 line:82%
that I will be victorious

1138
01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:42.880 line:82%
You fools do not know
this yet

1139
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:45.920 line:82%
Tonight

1140
01:42:47.170 --> 01:42:49.670 line:82%
Who knows what will happen?

1141
01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:53.630 line:82%
What will we gain?

1142
01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.630 line:82%
What will we lose?

1143
01:42:57.530 --> 01:43:00.050 line:82%
Tonight

1144
01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:03.750 line:82%
Who knows what will happen?

1145
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:07.750 line:82%
What will we gain?

1146
01:43:08.370 --> 01:43:10.750 line:82%
What will we lose?

1147
01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:03.130 line:82%
Come, let me tell you
something secretly

1148
01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:11.500 line:82%
Soon, the night is going to
change its hue secretly

1149
01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:17.460 line:82%
Then I will take you away
with me secretly

1150
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:21.670 line:82%
Where will you go?

1151
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:25.250 line:82%
Look! Here I am

1152
01:44:26.170 --> 01:44:31.500 line:82%
You fools do not know
this yet

1153
01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.230 line:82%
Tonight

1154
01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.300 line:82%
Who knows what will happen?

1155
01:44:39.330 --> 01:44:42.340 line:82%
What will we gain?

1156
01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:45.300 line:82%
What will we lose?

1157
01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:28.300 line:82%
Move it!

1158
01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.090 line:82%
Put your gun down.

1159
01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:39.840 line:82%
Open the door.

1160
01:47:42.490 --> 01:47:43.500 line:82%
Let him go.

1161
01:47:43.710 --> 01:47:44.820 line:82%
Shoot, Mr.Malik!

1162
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:46.497 line:82%
- Mr. Malik! Shoot him!
- Shut up.

1163
01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:48.307 line:82%
Let him go. Put your gun down.

1164
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:49.517 line:82%
Shoot, Mr. Malik!

1165
01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:50.917 line:82%
Get into the van. Move!

1166
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.300 line:82%
Malik! Shoot him.

1167
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:56.177 line:82%
Do you want me to shoot him?

1168
01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:57.280 line:82%
Relax.

1169
01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:58.990 line:82%
Malik.

1170
01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:02.417 line:82%
Close the door.

1171
01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:03.700 line:82%
Shut the door.

1172
01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:06.700 line:82%
Stop!

1173
01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:09.157 line:82%
Turn the engine off!

1174
01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:10.550 line:82%
Now!

1175
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:13.810 line:82%
I mean it.

1176
01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.260 line:82%
Now!

1177
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:13.127 line:82%
Yes.

1178
01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:14.390 line:82%
Okay, thank you.

1179
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:20.580 line:82%
What do you think, Verma?

1180
01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.670 line:82%
Is this man telling the truth
that he is not Don?

1181
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:28.460 line:82%
Don is very clever, sir.

1182
01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:32.420 line:82%
Claiming that he is Vijay,
Mr. D'Silva's informant,

1183
01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:35.210 line:82%
is surely a plan to escape punishment.

1184
01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:42.500 line:82%
Lets do this.

1185
01:49:43.130 --> 01:49:44.920 line:82%
Bring Narang and Mac here.

1186
01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.670 line:82%
Let them hear what he's saying.

1187
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:49.920 line:82%
Perhaps his words

1188
01:49:51.090 --> 01:49:52.460 line:82%
can break them.

1189
01:49:53.210 --> 01:49:56.000 line:82%
Mr. Malik, how many times do
I have to tell you I'm not Don!

1190
01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:58.230 line:82%
I'm Vijay, D'Silva saheb's informant.

1191
01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.750 line:82%
If Singhania's men are behind bars
today, it's all due to me.

1192
01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:04.800 line:82%
And why don't you go ask
D'Silva saheb who I am?

1193
01:50:05.170 --> 01:50:07.500 line:82%
DCP D'Silva is no longer with us.

1194
01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.167 line:82%
He's dead.

1195
01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:10.330 line:82%
Dead?

1196
01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:18.740 line:82%
Just a minute!

1197
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:20.570 line:82%
Then...

1198
01:50:21.090 --> 01:50:22.590 line:82%
Where's the disc I gave him?

1199
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.990 line:82%
What disc?

1200
01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:28.810 line:82%
I gave him a disc containing information
on Singhania's contacts and bank accounts.

1201
01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.240 line:82%
I'm sorry, but he didn't mention
any such disc.

1202
01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.730 line:82%
But it must be somewhere!

1203
01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.770 line:82%
In his apartment or somewhere here.

1204
01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.750 line:82%
In his desk, or...

1205
01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:41.650 line:82%
Mr. Malik!

1206
01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:43.590 line:82%
If I were Don,

1207
01:50:44.130 --> 01:50:46.500 line:82%
how would I know that he had this disc?

1208
01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.380 line:82%
DCP D'Silva's informant has
told us quite a lot about you.

1209
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:07.880 line:82%
Now, is there anything,
you two would like to say?

1210
01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:10.050 line:82%
What are you saying, Mr. Malik?

1211
01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.190 line:82%
This man is Don.

1212
01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:15.300 line:82%
And he is doing what he knows best.

1213
01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:16.640 line:82%
What's that?

1214
01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:20.247 line:82%
Making police officers like you
look like fools.

1215
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:21.420 line:82%
Shut up.

1216
01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:23.360 line:82%
Take them away.

1217
01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.090 line:82%
Verma, take a small team to
DCP D'Silva's apartment.

1218
01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:41.500 line:82%
If that disc is there,

1219
01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:44.110 line:82%
it's possible this man is telling
the truth.

1220
01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:46.210 line:82%
He is telling the truth.

1221
01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:48.340 line:82%
He is not Don.

1222
01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.430 line:82%
Malik saheb, I'm telling the truth.

1223
01:52:12.630 --> 01:52:15.010 line:82%
I gave D'Silva saheb the disc with
my own hands!

1224
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:23.590 line:82%
You don't believe me,
do you?

1225
01:52:23.850 --> 01:52:26.210 line:82%
Don, I gave you a chance.

1226
01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:29.597 line:82%
But now even you can't deny
the fact that you are Don.

1227
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.717 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1228
01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:32.047 line:82%
Verma, just send the guards in!

1229
01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:33.257 line:82%
Wait!

1230
01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:34.940 line:82%
There is more proof.

1231
01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.270 line:82%
Dr. Ashok Khilwani!

1232
01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.420 line:82%
He operated on me to make me
look like Don.

1233
01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:42.987 line:82%
Please! He knows the truth.

1234
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:44.500 line:82%
Please, sir... please!

1235
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:51.960 line:82%
Thank you, Freoze.

1236
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:01.337 line:82%
Malik saheb,

1237
01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:02.830 line:82%
did you talk to the doctor?

1238
01:53:03.130 --> 01:53:04.920 line:82%
- He is no longer alive.
- Not alive?!

1239
01:53:05.170 --> 01:53:08.550 line:82%
Last month, he and his assistant
died in a car accident.

1240
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:09.877 line:82%
Malik saheb,

1241
01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:11.507 line:82%
please believe me.
I'm not Don!

1242
01:53:11.590 --> 01:53:13.380 line:82%
The court will decide
this matter.

1243
01:53:13.590 --> 01:53:15.507 line:82%
Please listen to me!

1244
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:16.920 line:82%
I'm Vijay, Malik saheb!

1245
01:53:17.130 --> 01:53:18.910 line:82%
I'm not Don, I'm Vijay!

1246
01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.130 line:82%
Try and understand.

1247
01:53:29.170 --> 01:53:30.340 line:82%
Hello, Vijay!

1248
01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:35.150 line:82%
We heard everything.

1249
01:53:37.050 --> 01:53:38.590 line:82%
Don't be silly, Mac.

1250
01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:41.120 line:82%
I am Don.

1251
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:47.050 line:82%
I only said that to confuse them.

1252
01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:50.960 line:82%
What's happening?

1253
01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:52.667 line:82%
Stop it...

1254
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:56.000 line:82%
- Narang, make them understand.
- Shut up.

1255
01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:58.400 line:82%
You are Vijay.

1256
01:53:59.170 --> 01:54:01.420 line:82%
But if they attack you here,

1257
01:54:02.590 --> 01:54:04.130 line:82%
the police will realize

1258
01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.250 line:82%
you are not Don.

1259
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:08.547 line:82%
Get back.

1260
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:09.650 line:82%
Get back!

1261
01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:17.850 line:82%
So...

1262
01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:21.230 line:82%
Behaving a bit too smart,
weren't you, boy?!

1263
01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:24.590 line:82%
Now get ready to die.

1264
01:54:26.590 --> 01:54:29.210 line:82%
The penalty for selling
drugs in Malaysia

1265
01:54:30.010 --> 01:54:31.280 line:82%
is death.

1266
01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:34.550 line:82%
And the court will surely give
Don the death penalty.

1267
01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:39.300 line:82%
If it doesn't...

1268
01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:45.460 line:82%
we'll kill Vijay in jail.

1269
01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.210 line:82%
What happened, sir?

1270
01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:04.170 line:82%
They say that until we get
a date in court,

1271
01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.050 line:82%
it's not safe to keep these
dangerous criminals here.

1272
01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:11.290 line:82%
So, what is their intention?

1273
01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:16.170 line:82%
They have a high security jail on
an island, five miles off the coast.

1274
01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:20.240 line:82%
They'll all be flown there
first thing tomorrow.

1275
01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:18.080 line:82%
Excuse me.

1276
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.420 line:82%
I need to use the toilet, please!

1277
01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.250 line:82%
Very badly!

1278
01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:28.160 line:82%
Hey!

1279
01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:35.130 line:82%
Okay.

1280
01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:40.810 line:82%
Come through!

1281
01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:45.487 line:82%
- Hey, hey...
- Easy!

1282
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:46.880 line:82%
Okay, okay.

1283
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:48.870 line:82%
Sorry.

1284
01:57:00.050 --> 01:57:01.370 line:82%
Come through.

1285
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:04.490 line:82%
Hi.

1286
01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.290 line:82%
Give me your gun, please!

1287
01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:13.090 line:82%
Just stay there.

1288
01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:14.930 line:82%
Come on!

1289
01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:17.307 line:82%
Now the handcuffs.

1290
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:18.770 line:82%
Go on!

1291
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:21.070 line:82%
Quick!

1292
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:25.357 line:82%
The other one!

1293
01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.440 line:82%
Quick, quck!

1294
01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:35.490 line:82%
Now give me his gun, please.

1295
01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:37.300 line:82%
Quick, quick, quick!

1296
01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:45.087 line:82%
Take him with the others.

1297
01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:46.260 line:82%
Move it!

1298
01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:51.177 line:82%
Fast!

1299
01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:52.480 line:82%
Go on!

1300
02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:13.880 line:82%
No!

1301
02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:00.800 line:82%
Congratulations, Jasjit.

1302
02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:04.890 line:82%
The information on this disc

1303
02:01:05.590 --> 02:01:07.420 line:82%
is like a winning lottery ticket.

1304
02:01:10.750 --> 02:01:15.590 line:82%
I know a man who can get you
a lot of money for this disc.

1305
02:01:28.710 --> 02:01:29.990 line:82%
Jasjit.

1306
02:01:33.590 --> 02:01:36.300 line:82%
D'Silva said that he knew
where Deepu was.

1307
02:01:37.170 --> 02:01:42.550 line:82%
Perhaps the buyer we find
may have known D'Silva?

1308
02:01:45.210 --> 02:01:46.367 line:82%
Haatim,

1309
02:01:46.450 --> 02:01:50.670 line:82%
If he can lead me to Deepu,
I'll let him have all that money.

1310
02:01:56.850 --> 02:01:57.950 line:82%
I see.

1311
02:01:58.630 --> 02:02:00.800 line:82%
And you have the disc.

1312
02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:04.217 line:82%
No problem.

1313
02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:05.300 line:82%
It'll be done.

1314
02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:11.230 line:82%
Malik.

1315
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:16.510 line:82%
What?

1316
02:02:23.630 --> 02:02:25.320 line:82%
What happened, sir?
Who was that?

1317
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:31.170 line:82%
An incident on board forced the
pilot to make an emergency landing.

1318
02:02:33.710 --> 02:02:34.880 line:82%
Don has escaped!

1319
02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:09.660 line:82%
Thanks.

1320
02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:12.630 line:82%
Thanks for coming!

1321
02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:14.440 line:82%
Thank God you're all right!

1322
02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:17.090 line:82%
You call this being all right?

1323
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:19.510 line:82%
Vijay,

1324
02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:21.650 line:82%
I know what the truth is.

1325
02:03:23.710 --> 02:03:24.910 line:82%
The truth?

1326
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:29.380 line:82%
Why would the police believe you, Roma?

1327
02:03:35.130 --> 02:03:38.050 line:82%
Only the disc can prove my innocence now.

1328
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:40.170 line:82%
We'll get the disc.

1329
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:45.250 line:82%
The man who stole the disc

1330
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:49.550 line:82%
cannot be honest enough
to return it to the police.

1331
02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:53.050 line:82%
He's sure to try and sell it.

1332
02:03:56.050 --> 02:03:57.050 line:82%
Just a minute, Roma.

1333
02:03:58.590 --> 02:03:59.920 line:82%
Singhania has an agent here

1334
02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:04.090 line:82%
who kept him informed about
the cops and our enemies.

1335
02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:07.710 line:82%
He could be of use.

1336
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:11.750 line:82%
Try and contact him somehow.

1337
02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.830 line:82%
But if you are found in the meantime...

1338
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:20.907 line:82%
I mean, the police will be
searching everywhere for you.

1339
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:22.590 line:82%
I know!

1340
02:04:25.210 --> 02:04:26.800 line:82%
But where can I go?

1341
02:04:29.090 --> 02:04:30.300 line:82%
There is one place.

1342
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:37.717 line:82%
Where is Ramesh's place?

1343
02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:39.050 line:82%
Close by. To the right.

1344
02:04:56.590 --> 02:04:57.880 line:82%
Stop please.

1345
02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:06.090 line:82%
Yours, sir?

1346
02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:11.467 line:82%
All units respond.

1347
02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:12.597 line:82%
Wait.

1348
02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:14.117 line:82%
We have a fugitive situation.

1349
02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:15.317 line:82%
Suspect's name is Don.

1350
02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:18.000 line:82%
Last seen wearing a dark jacket,
trousers and a gray shirt.

1351
02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.420 line:82%
He is of Indian origin.

1352
02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.810 line:82%
Who are you, saheb?
What do you want?

1353
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:16.360 line:82%
How does one explain
who he is?

1354
02:06:17.090 --> 02:06:18.960 line:82%
Just know that we are
in big trouble

1355
02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:22.500 line:82%
and need shelter for a while,
that's all.

1356
02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:26.380 line:82%
It's not a police affair, eh?

1357
02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:31.340 line:82%
Should we tell them?

1358
02:06:32.630 --> 02:06:33.900 line:82%
Uncle...

1359
02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:36.880 line:82%
It's a police affair and

1360
02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:38.730 line:82%
an affair of the heart too!

1361
02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.340 line:82%
Well, I get it now!

1362
02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:44.340 line:82%
You've run away?

1363
02:06:44.710 --> 02:06:47.050 line:82%
No, Uncle. I haven't run away.

1364
02:06:48.090 --> 02:06:50.090 line:82%
I've been kidnapped!

1365
02:06:52.190 --> 02:06:53.510 line:82%
That's great!

1366
02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:57.300 line:82%
Where can we witness
love like this nowadays?

1367
02:06:57.710 --> 02:07:00.470 line:82%
Come this way, saheb.
Come, madam.

1368
02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:03.590 line:82%
Sit down, saheb.

1369
02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:06.190 line:82%
Uncle.

1370
02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:10.787 line:82%
Saheb, have some Bhang!

1371
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:11.877 line:82%
Bhang?

1372
02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:13.617 line:82%
Tonight we honor Lord Shiva!

1373
02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:16.547 line:82%
It is a holy offering to Shiva. Drink!

1374
02:07:16.630 --> 02:07:19.377 line:82%
Oh, the Lord will bless you for
drinking his favorite brew!

1375
02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:20.840 line:82%
You also try it.

1376
02:07:21.050 --> 02:07:22.170 line:82%
Cheers.

1377
02:07:30.250 --> 02:07:32.210 line:82%
Happy Mahashivratri everyone.

1378
02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:08.000 line:82%
It's all right, brother!

1379
02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:15.550 line:82%
Honestly, Uncle...

1380
02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:20.340 line:82%
If I had listened to my mother
when I was a boy,

1381
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:23.250 line:82%
I wouldn't be seeing such days!

1382
02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:28.130 line:82%
Why? What did she say?

1383
02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:33.800 line:82%
Since I never listened to her,
how can I tell you what she said!

1384
02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:39.547 line:82%
If you're done,
can we please leave?

1385
02:08:39.630 --> 02:08:42.380 line:82%
Leave! But where would we go?

1386
02:08:43.250 --> 02:08:44.590 line:82%
D'Silva.

1387
02:08:46.250 --> 02:08:48.150 line:82%
DCP saheb!

1388
02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.340 line:82%
You set up a good way to get me
up there before you left!

1389
02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:55.910 line:82%
Well done!

1390
02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:57.570 line:82%
Sir, paan?

1391
02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:00.750 line:82%
Hey buddy! I don't want it!

1392
02:09:01.650 --> 02:09:04.460 line:82%
Eat it. It's from Benaras.

1393
02:09:06.230 --> 02:09:07.500 line:82%
Really?

1394
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:12.550 line:82%
But Don never ate paan.

1395
02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:14.420 line:82%
Never.

1396
02:09:14.850 --> 02:09:17.000 line:82%
Don, who?

1397
02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:19.750 line:82%
Don, who??!

1398
02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:25.910 line:82%
Don means me, meaning Vijay,
a.k.a Don, meaning...

1399
02:09:26.250 --> 02:09:27.250 line:82%
- Paan!
- Pawn!!

1400
02:09:28.210 --> 02:09:29.660 line:82%
I didn't understand a thing.

1401
02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:33.670 line:82%
How do I tell you, brother?

1402
02:09:34.590 --> 02:09:39.030 line:82%
The plight I am in

1403
02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:40.537 line:82%
Tell us, tell us

1404
02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:43.750 line:82%
I set out to eat "halwa"

1405
02:09:44.130 --> 02:09:46.420 line:82%
and ended up burning my mouth!

1406
02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:55.170 line:82%
What can I say?

1407
02:09:55.630 --> 02:09:56.970 line:82%
How can I explain?

1408
02:09:57.380 --> 02:09:58.800 line:82%
I'm in a bad situation

1409
02:09:59.090 --> 02:10:00.380 line:82%
that's hard to escape

1410
02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.417 line:82%
It's like a violent storm!

1411
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:04.127 line:82%
It's like a raging wind!

1412
02:10:04.210 --> 02:10:05.380 line:82%
I've had to

1413
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:07.130 line:82%
run for my life!

1414
02:10:07.730 --> 02:10:09.100 line:82%
A long and winding

1415
02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:10.780 line:82%
chase has been on!

1416
02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:13.100 line:82%
Day and night, I've been awake

1417
02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:15.300 line:82%
running helter skelter

1418
02:10:16.170 --> 02:10:17.500 line:82%
Sometimes this way!

1419
02:10:18.190 --> 02:10:19.340 line:82%
Sometimes that way!

1420
02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:21.667 line:82%
Sometimes this way!
Sometimes that way!

1421
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:23.337 line:82%
Ran this way once
and that way next!

1422
02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:24.977 line:82%
Then you gave me this paan

1423
02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:28.130 line:82%
and life has returned to my tired body!

1424
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:37.210 line:82%
Eating a paan from Benaras

1425
02:10:40.050 --> 02:10:43.210 line:82%
Eating a paan from Benaras

1426
02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:46.630 line:82%
unlocked my deadened brain

1427
02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:50.340 line:82%
Eating a paan from Benaras

1428
02:10:50.610 --> 02:10:53.840 line:82%
unlocked my deadened brain

1429
02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:57.547 line:82%
Now watch the things I'll do

1430
02:10:57.630 --> 02:11:00.420 line:82%
to straighten up everyone

1431
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:02.030 line:82%
This boy

1432
02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:03.760 line:82%
This boy

1433
02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:07.340 line:82%
This boy from the banks of the Ganges!

1434
02:11:13.170 --> 02:11:16.617 line:82%
Eating a paan from Benaras

1435
02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:19.800 line:82%
unlocked my deadened brain

1436
02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:46.130 line:82%
I've been cursed

1437
02:11:46.710 --> 02:11:49.090 line:82%
to be caught up in this maze, alas!

1438
02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:54.050 line:82%
My life is in limbo

1439
02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:58.000 line:82%
I'm at the hangman's mercy, alas!

1440
02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:02.090 line:82%
So honest and simple.
So innocent, yes I am

1441
02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:09.090 line:82%
So honest and simple.
So innocent, yes I am

1442
02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:12.500 line:82%
Don't know how I ended up
amid this educated lot?

1443
02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:14.000 line:82%
With a sweetened knife

1444
02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:17.500 line:82%
With a sweetened knife
they've slit my throat!

1445
02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:20.800 line:82%
This boy from the banks of the Ganges!

1446
02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.500 line:82%
Eating a paan from Benaras

1447
02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:32.920 line:82%
unlocked my deadened brain

1448
02:12:44.290 --> 02:12:48.050 line:82%
A lovely lass, unique and desirable

1449
02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:52.380 line:82%
Her enrapturing charm
turns all heads

1450
02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:55.827 line:82%
wherever she goes

1451
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:58.710 line:82%
and her body sparkles
like precious stones

1452
02:12:58.990 --> 02:13:00.877 line:82%
Her dazzling eyes carry
a world of dreams

1453
02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:02.340 line:82%
her lips, youth's nectar

1454
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:05.257 line:82%
A flirtatious swagger in her walk

1455
02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:07.967 line:82%
sprinkles the air with her
sandalwood-scented body

1456
02:13:08.050 --> 02:13:11.130 line:82%
The vision of her
sets your heart aflame

1457
02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:13.500 line:82%
Her face is moon-bright

1458
02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:16.340 line:82%
Her eyes like a gazelle

1459
02:13:18.170 --> 02:13:19.510 line:82%
Her face is moon-bright.

1460
02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:21.200 line:82%
Her eyes like a gazelle

1461
02:13:21.710 --> 02:13:23.050 line:82%
She is beautiful

1462
02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:24.500 line:82%
As sweet as honey

1463
02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:30.960 line:82%
A beautiful maiden

1464
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:34.130 line:82%
has fallen for me, alas!

1465
02:13:37.590 --> 02:13:39.750 line:82%
A sweetened skewer

1466
02:13:41.090 --> 02:13:43.420 line:82%
has pierced my heart, alas!

1467
02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:48.380 line:82%
So bright and fair, she's a spicy lass

1468
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:54.920 line:82%
So bright and fair, she's a spicy lass

1469
02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:58.050 line:82%
A fighting spirit to match,
she stole my heart

1470
02:13:58.250 --> 02:13:59.610 line:82%
Now that I have her love

1471
02:14:00.170 --> 02:14:03.170 line:82%
Now that I have her love
my life has blossomed!

1472
02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:06.340 line:82%
This boy from the banks of the Ganges!

1473
02:14:11.630 --> 02:14:14.840 line:82%
Eating a paan from Benaras

1474
02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:18.250 line:82%
unlocked my deadened brain

1476
02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:25.000 line:82%

1477
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:28.750 line:82%
Now watch the things I'll do

1478
02:14:29.250 --> 02:14:32.050 line:82%
to straighten up everyone

1479
02:14:32.570 --> 02:14:33.700 line:82%
This boy

1480
02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:35.810 line:82%
This boy

1481
02:14:36.070 --> 02:14:38.920 line:82%
This boy from the banks of the Ganges!

1482
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:55.837 line:82%
Yes?

1483
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:56.950 line:82%
Yes, it's me.

1484
02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:00.000 line:82%
There's a buyer for the disc here.

1485
02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:04.420 line:82%
Yes, ready to pay in dollars.

1486
02:15:06.010 --> 02:15:07.147 line:82%
Just a minute.

1487
02:15:07.230 --> 02:15:08.600 line:82%
You should speak directly.

1488
02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:23.970 line:82%
We have Deepu.

1489
02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:26.380 line:82%
If you want to see him alive,
bring the disc.

1490
02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:32.667 line:82%
Jasjit.

1491
02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:35.050 line:82%
If you want to see your
son alive,

1492
02:15:36.130 --> 02:15:40.750 line:82%
bring the disc at 5 p.m. sharp
to this address.

1493
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:52.910 line:82%
Jasjit.

1494
02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:08.710 line:82%
- Haatim Qureishi?
- Yes?

1495
02:16:09.050 --> 02:16:10.250 line:82%
May I come inside?

1496
02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:18.720 line:82%
Who are you?

1497
02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:21.510 line:82%
I've got nothing personal against you.

1498
02:16:22.170 --> 02:16:24.170 line:82%
But if you don't hand over the disc to me,

1499
02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.170 line:82%
I'll be forced to

1500
02:16:27.170 --> 02:16:29.340 line:82%
change my mind.

1501
02:16:31.190 --> 02:16:32.388 line:82%
What disc?

1502
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:36.250 line:82%
The one you wanted to sell Roma.

1503
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:38.139 line:82%
Remember?

1504
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:44.780 line:82%
Sorry.

1505
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:47.630 line:82%
The disc is with my friend, Jasjit.

1506
02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:54.340 line:82%
And where is your friend, Jasjit?

1507
02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:18.820 line:82%
Where's the disc?

1508
02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:20.216 line:82%
Where's Deepu?

1509
02:17:20.299 --> 02:17:21.340 line:82%
Deepu will come.

1510
02:17:22.710 --> 02:17:24.380 line:82%
Call me when he does.

1511
02:17:25.290 --> 02:17:28.130 line:82%
You already have my phone number.

1512
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:34.459 line:82%
Jasjit.

1513
02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:37.350 line:82%
Seeing your punctuality,

1514
02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.590 line:82%
I must say

1515
02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:41.960 line:82%
I'm very impressed!

1516
02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:46.490 line:82%
D'Silva?

1517
02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:48.209 line:82%
No.

1518
02:17:49.330 --> 02:17:50.400 line:82%
Vardhaan.

1519
02:17:50.809 --> 02:17:51.920 line:82%
Vardhaan?

1520
02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.630 line:82%
- But you are...
- ...Dead?

1521
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:56.830 line:82%
Right?

1522
02:17:58.090 --> 02:18:02.050 line:82%
For a man who can keep the
police in the dark for years,

1523
02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:09.090 line:82%
creating the drama of a mere
accident is no big deal!

1524
02:18:11.590 --> 02:18:13.007 line:82%
Do you want me to shoot him?

1525
02:18:13.090 --> 02:18:14.139 line:82%
Relax.

1526
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:15.799 line:82%
Malik.

1527
02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:19.240 line:82%
Shut the door.

1528
02:18:20.370 --> 02:18:21.469 line:82%
Let's go.

1529
02:18:23.710 --> 02:18:24.969 line:82%
Stop!

1530
02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:28.670 line:82%
Turn the engine off.

1531
02:18:30.210 --> 02:18:31.330 line:82%
I mean it.

1532
02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:32.629 line:82%
Come on.

1533
02:18:51.170 --> 02:18:52.250 line:82%
You're very cunning.

1534
02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:54.709 line:82%
Thank you.

1535
02:18:54.959 --> 02:18:56.920 line:82%
Now all I want is the disc.

1536
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:59.130 line:82%
Which you will give me.

1537
02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:01.570 line:82%
I don't believe it.

1538
02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:04.630 line:82%
Now I get it.

1539
02:19:06.170 --> 02:19:09.210 line:82%
Why the police never found
the diamonds in that basement.

1540
02:19:10.450 --> 02:19:11.960 line:82%
I recognize that ring.

1541
02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:14.420 line:82%
What did you think,

1542
02:19:14.630 --> 02:19:16.630 line:82%
that I brought the disc with me?

1543
02:19:18.250 --> 02:19:20.250 line:82%
Do you think I am a fool?

1544
02:19:21.630 --> 02:19:23.010 line:82%
Remember?

1545
02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:26.590 line:82%
That night, you asked me
the same question!

1546
02:19:27.590 --> 02:19:29.750 line:82%
You have a very good memory.

1547
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:33.590 line:82%
It'll help in recognizing your son.

1548
02:19:34.170 --> 02:19:35.440 line:82%
Daddy.

1549
02:19:39.710 --> 02:19:40.818 line:82%
Deepu.

1550
02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:46.637 line:82%
Vardhaan! If anything happens...

1551
02:19:46.719 --> 02:19:47.940 line:82%
Relax, J.J.!

1552
02:19:48.590 --> 02:19:50.250 line:82%
I don't enjoy bloodshed.

1553
02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.590 line:82%
All I want is

1554
02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:56.130 line:82%
the disc.

1555
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:57.830 line:82%
All right.

1556
02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:00.270 line:82%
You'll get it.

1557
02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:11.390 line:82%
Jasjit here.

1558
02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:13.730 line:82%
Bring the disc.

1559
02:20:15.490 --> 02:20:17.040 line:82%
My man will arrive here at 7:00.

1560
02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:20.840 line:82%
You and your son will

1561
02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:24.350 line:82%
remain my guests until then.

1562
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:36.120 line:82%
Phone, please.

1563
02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:45.790 line:82%
Take him away.

1564
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:56.420 line:82%
Kill them when you have the disc!

1565
02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:11.460 line:82%
Are you okay, son?

1566
02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:16.700 line:82%
Deepu,

1567
02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:18.130 line:82%
Listen carefully.

1568
02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:22.380 line:82%
As long as they do not get what they want,

1569
02:21:22.690 --> 02:21:24.250 line:82%
our lives will not be in danger.

1570
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:27.750 line:82%
- But, Daddy! At 7:00, when your...
- Nothing will happen at 7:00.

1571
02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:29.170 line:82%
Nobody is going to come.

1572
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:33.000 line:82%
That phone call was to buy us time.

1573
02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:36.210 line:82%
I'm scared, Daddy.

1574
02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:40.210 line:82%
Don't be, my son.

1575
02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:42.170 line:82%
I'm with you now.

1576
02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:44.570 line:82%
Nothing will happen to you.

1577
02:21:45.370 --> 02:21:46.460 line:82%
Nothing will happen.

1578
02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:18.080 line:82%
Yes, Mr. Vardhaan.

1579
02:22:19.970 --> 02:22:21.630 line:82%
Nobody has come so far.

1580
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:25.800 line:82%
Okay.

1581
02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:39.170 line:82%
Find them... Find them.

1582
02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:48.590 line:82%
- Now where, Daddy?
- Keep it down!

1583
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:59.037 line:82%
Just a minute.

1584
02:22:59.110 --> 02:23:00.580 line:82%
Let me see.

1585
02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:17.440 line:82%
They must be hiding close by.
Keep looking.

1586
02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:41.780 line:82%
There he is!

1587
02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.510 line:82%
Don't shoot.
Only he knows where the disc is.

1588
02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:05.030 line:82%
Daddy.

1589
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:49.920 line:82%
Uncle Vijay!

1590
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:12.910 line:82%
Daddy, stop!

1591
02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:14.700 line:82%
This is Uncle Vijay.

1592
02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:17.420 line:82%
He took care of me when you went away.

1593
02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:20.500 line:82%
Uncle Vijay, this is my Daddy.

1594
02:27:34.210 --> 02:27:35.420 line:82%
Take it.

1595
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:37.017 line:82%
Vijay,

1596
02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:40.540 line:82%
Had it not been for you, I don't know
where Deepu would be today.

1597
02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:42.350 line:82%
Please, Jasjit!

1598
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:45.130 line:82%
Whatever I did for him,

1599
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:52.920 line:82%
Deepu is a lovable boy.

1600
02:27:54.970 --> 02:27:57.150 line:82%
Anyway, why do you need this disc
so badly?

1601
02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.050 line:82%
Just know that the only way
out of the mess I'm in

1602
02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:04.550 line:82%
is this disc.

1603
02:28:05.390 --> 02:28:06.960 line:82%
And your testimony.

1604
02:28:07.370 --> 02:28:08.370 line:82%
I don't understand.

1605
02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:11.630 line:82%
Your testimony will prove

1606
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:15.370 line:82%
that this disc was with DCP D'Silva.

1607
02:28:16.030 --> 02:28:17.420 line:82%
DCP D'Silva?!

1608
02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:18.760 line:82%
Yes.

1609
02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:21.540 line:82%
He was the only one in the
police department who knew

1610
02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:23.590 line:82%
that he is not Don, but Vijay.

1611
02:28:23.850 --> 02:28:24.967 line:82%
But after he died...

1612
02:28:25.050 --> 02:28:26.120 line:82%
He is not dead!

1613
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:30.960 line:82%
His real name is Vardhaan.

1614
02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:33.627 line:82%
And just a little while ago,
I met him!

1615
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:34.740 line:82%
No!

1616
02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:38.710 line:82%
That can't be.

1617
02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:42.460 line:82%
I mean,

1618
02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:44.600 line:82%
your eyes must have deceived you!

1619
02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:46.380 line:82%
No, I have not been deceived.

1620
02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:49.460 line:82%
DCP D'Silva is Vardhaan!

1621
02:29:05.220 --> 02:29:08.460 line:82%
He made me pose as Don.

1622
02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:11.380 line:82%
He obtained the disc,

1623
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:16.590 line:82%
and got a chance to kill
Singhania.

1624
02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:21.460 line:82%
Then, he faked his own death

1625
02:29:22.290 --> 02:29:24.950 line:82%
and left me to die as Don.

1626
02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:29.550 line:82%
DCP D'Silva... Vardhaan!

1627
02:29:36.330 --> 02:29:38.550 line:82%
You've made a big move!

1628
02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:41.130 line:82%
But he must never have thought

1629
02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:43.960 line:82%
that I'd steal the disc.

1630
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:51.130 line:82%
Give the disc to Vardhaan!

1631
02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:54.547 line:82%
Vijay! What are you saying?

1632
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:55.820 line:82%
Yes, Roma.

1633
02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:04.170 line:82%
A final meeting with DCP D'Silva
is very important.

1634
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:17.460 line:82%
Don't worry, darling.

1635
02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:20.960 line:82%
Today will be the last day
of Vijay's life.

1636
02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:42.300 line:82%
I've arrived at the place you told me to.

1637
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:43.760 line:82%
Alone.

1638
02:30:44.090 --> 02:30:45.300 line:82%
Good.

1639
02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:48.550 line:82%
Buy a ticket at the counter.
There's a bridge on level one.

1640
02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.790 line:82%
Go there... And yes.,

1641
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:53.380 line:82%
don't forget the money.

1642
02:30:54.100 --> 02:30:56.300 line:82%
Or you'll have to buy the ticket again.

1643
02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:54.960 line:82%
You seem to be in a great hurry.

1644
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:56.960 line:82%
Now where do I go?

1645
02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:00.960 line:82%
Throw the bag down.

1646
02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:03.310 line:82%
What?

1647
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:05.300 line:82%
Throw the bag down.

1648
02:32:18.350 --> 02:32:20.000 line:82%
I can see you, Jasjit.

1649
02:32:20.470 --> 02:32:22.330 line:82%
But I don't see the disc.

1650
02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:25.630 line:82%
You'll get what you want.

1651
02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:27.170 line:82%
Throw it.

1652
02:32:46.690 --> 02:32:47.700 line:82%
Looks good.

1653
02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:49.600 line:82%
Where's the disc?

1654
02:32:50.350 --> 02:32:52.840 line:82%
Upper viewing platform.
Silver briefcase.

1655
02:33:18.990 --> 02:33:20.090 line:82%
Damn!

1656
02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:32.800 line:82%
Poor DCP D'Silva!

1657
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:34.980 line:82%
You!

1658
02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:37.020 line:82%
What are you doing here?

1659
02:33:37.460 --> 02:33:40.090 line:82%
I should be asking you that!

1660
02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.000 line:82%
You're dead, remember?

1661
02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:44.580 line:82%
- What do you want?
- Answers to some questions.

1662
02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:46.800 line:82%
Please! This is no time
for interviews!

1663
02:33:47.070 --> 02:33:49.590 line:82%
All right then. Here's the second reason.

1664
02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.670 line:82%
I'm going to kill you today.

1665
02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:00.130 line:82%
You have the guts to shoot?

1666
02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:02.250 line:82%
You've trained me pretty well.

1667
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.590 line:82%
What will you gain by killing me?

1668
02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:09.920 line:82%
There are some deeds in which
profit and loss don't matter.

1669
02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:13.630 line:82%
They just have to be done.

1670
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:15.460 line:82%
Very good!

1671
02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:19.987 line:82%
But how will you prove your
innocence if you kill me?

1672
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:22.920 line:82%
Only I know your real identity.

1673
02:34:23.250 --> 02:34:25.840 line:82%
Perhaps that disc can be of use.
What do you think?

1674
02:34:28.060 --> 02:34:29.590 line:82%
You have the disc?

1675
02:34:30.210 --> 02:34:31.250 line:82%
No...

1676
02:34:31.850 --> 02:34:33.910 line:82%
It was my love for you that
dragged me here!

1677
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:37.590 line:82%
Give me the disc.

1678
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:41.500 line:82%
I'm ready to send you to
any corner of the world.

1679
02:34:43.050 --> 02:34:44.370 line:82%
Think it over.

1680
02:34:44.670 --> 02:34:47.670 line:82%
You must be exhausted
running from the police!

1681
02:34:48.210 --> 02:34:50.380 line:82%
Not as much as from thinking
over and over

1682
02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:53.840 line:82%
why you betrayed me.

1683
02:34:54.170 --> 02:34:55.300 line:82%
Come on, get over it.

1684
02:34:56.100 --> 02:34:57.127 line:82%
What betrayal?

1685
02:34:57.210 --> 02:34:58.580 line:82%
This is the real world.

1686
02:34:58.750 --> 02:35:02.710 line:82%
You think Singhania asked me
before seizing Boris's entire empire?

1687
02:35:03.250 --> 02:35:06.710 line:82%
I created the entire business!
With my intelligence and guts.

1688
02:35:07.090 --> 02:35:10.750 line:82%
And now to get it back,
I can use thousands like you.

1689
02:35:14.050 --> 02:35:15.180 line:82%
All right.

1690
02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:17.080 line:82%
I betrayed you.

1691
02:35:18.210 --> 02:35:19.440 line:82%
You want an apology?

1692
02:35:20.470 --> 02:35:21.640 line:82%
I'm so sorry, Vijay!

1693
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:23.960 line:82%
Happy?

1694
02:35:24.450 --> 02:35:25.730 line:82%
Feel any better?!!

1695
02:35:26.460 --> 02:35:27.910 line:82%
Use your head, Vijay.

1696
02:35:28.590 --> 02:35:29.910 line:82%
There's still time.

1697
02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:32.040 line:82%
Join me.

1698
02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:34.070 line:82%
You will gain from it

1699
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:36.920 line:82%
and so will I.

1700
02:36:10.750 --> 02:36:12.270 line:82%
That's the signal!

1701
02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:14.417 line:82%
All teams move in.

1702
02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:15.820 line:82%
I repeat all teams move in.

1703
02:36:17.570 --> 02:36:19.410 line:82%
Good boy! Come.

1704
02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:39.060 line:82%
Put your gun down.

1705
02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:40.497 line:82%
This is the police.

1706
02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:42.820 line:82%
I repeat... Put your gun down.

1707
02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:22.890 line:82%
Stop, Vijay!

1708
02:38:27.700 --> 02:38:30.270 line:82%
Don't make this mistake.
Hand him over to us.

1709
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:32.570 line:82%
Please, kill me!

1710
02:38:33.250 --> 02:38:36.800 line:82%
You will be making a huge
mistake if you let me live.

1711
02:38:37.410 --> 02:38:40.050 line:82%
Don't listen to him!
He is trying to set you up!

1712
02:38:40.430 --> 02:38:41.670 line:82%
Shut up!

1713
02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:45.500 line:82%
Remember! Wherever you go,
someday I will find you.

1714
02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:48.437 line:82%
And that day will be the last day
of your life!

1715
02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:50.087 line:82%
Don't listen to him, Vijay.

1716
02:38:50.170 --> 02:38:52.590 line:82%
After that, Roma.
Then, Deepu.

1717
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:55.380 line:82%
I'll kill them both

1718
02:38:55.920 --> 02:38:58.420 line:82%
unless you kill me now.

1719
02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:03.750 line:82%
In that case, Vardhaan,

1720
02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:07.100 line:82%
I'll be waiting for you.

1721
02:39:18.270 --> 02:39:19.380 line:82%
Hurry up.

1722
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:24.750 line:82%
Take him quickly!

1723
02:39:34.980 --> 02:39:36.070 line:82%
Vijay?

1724
02:39:36.270 --> 02:39:37.460 line:82%
Hold on, please.

1725
02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:41.660 line:82%
You finally did it.

1726
02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:44.220 line:82%
You proved your innocence.

1727
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:48.050 line:82%
It wouldn't have been possible
without you.

1728
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:50.150 line:82%
Thank you.

1729
02:39:52.750 --> 02:39:55.170 line:82%
Sir, we must take you to
the hospital right away.

1730
02:39:55.390 --> 02:39:56.507 line:82%
Yes, of course!

1731
02:39:56.590 --> 02:39:57.647 line:82%
Come with me Roma.

1732
02:39:57.730 --> 02:39:59.730 line:82%
Excuse me, can't she come along
with us?

1733
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:02.220 line:82%
I'm sorry, sir. Ma'am, please step aside.

1734
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:04.500 line:82%
Don't worry, I'll see you at the hospital.

1735
02:40:06.370 --> 02:40:07.370 line:82%
Vijay!

1736
02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:11.880 line:82%
I love you.

1737
02:40:21.050 --> 02:40:23.590 line:82%
Even I like wild cats a lot.

1738
02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:52.710 line:82%
Come closer.

1739
02:40:59.050 --> 02:41:01.420 line:82%
I like wild cats a lot.

1740
02:41:05.090 --> 02:41:06.380 line:82%
Wild cats!

1741
02:41:10.490 --> 02:41:13.337 line:82%
- Mr. Malik, where's that ambulance going?
- One minute, sir.

1742
02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:16.130 line:82%
- To the hospital. Why, what's the matter?
- He's Don!

1743
02:41:17.050 --> 02:41:19.050 line:82%
"I like wild cats a lot."

1744
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:22.090 line:82%
Don said that to me,
whispered it in my ear!

1745
02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:26.960 line:82%
If that was Vijay, how did he know it?

1746
02:41:42.350 --> 02:41:44.860 line:82%
You're giving him 2ml of Diazepam,
aren't you?

1747
02:41:45.130 --> 02:41:46.797 line:82%
Yes, sir. I'm giving it right now.

1748
02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:47.960 line:82%
Good.

1749
02:41:51.050 --> 02:41:53.500 line:82%
The doctors have kept him in
a sedated state.

1750
02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:07.630 line:82%
All the marks and scars
that were on Don's body,

1751
02:42:08.250 --> 02:42:09.417 line:82%
need to be put on yours.

1752
02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:10.550 line:82%
Sure.

1753
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:12.750 line:82%
On me?

1754
02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:33.310 line:82%
I was about to tell you,

1755
02:42:33.650 --> 02:42:37.370 line:82%
I got Deepu admitted to
Malaysia's International School.

1756
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:41.090 line:82%
As Don, that means you

1757
02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:43.640 line:82%
will go back to your companions

1758
02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:46.250 line:82%
ill and wounded.

1759
02:42:47.380 --> 02:42:49.250 line:82%
You will have lost your memory.

1760
02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:53.920 line:82%
The more you learn
about Don's life...

1761
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:58.000 line:82%
The closer I'll get to
regaining my memory.

1762
02:42:58.460 --> 02:42:59.650 line:82%
Thank you.

1763
02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:03.290 line:82%
You think exactly like the comic book
hero, Chacha Chaudhary!

1764
02:44:24.130 --> 02:44:26.250 line:82%
Weren't you trying to quit?

1765
02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.170 line:82%
What else can I quit?

1766
02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:31.880 line:82%
I've quit everyone,
except you.

1767
02:44:32.670 --> 02:44:33.877 line:82%
Really, Don.

1768
02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:36.260 line:82%
I thought that you would get caught today.

1769
02:44:37.170 --> 02:44:38.380 line:82%
Or that I'd lose you.

1770
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:40.620 line:82%
To whom... Roma?

1771
02:44:42.570 --> 02:44:44.920 line:82%
- What about the disc that the police...
- ...It's fake.

1772
02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:46.850 line:82%
What's on it is meaningless!

1773
02:44:48.340 --> 02:44:49.747 line:82%
Don't worry, sweetheart.

1774
02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:52.550 line:82%
Now the reins of Asia's
underworld are in my hands!

1775
02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:54.590 line:82%
I am the king!

1776
02:44:56.380 --> 02:44:58.240 line:82%
As for catching me,

1777
02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:00.500 line:82%
always remember this!

1778
02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:02.050 line:82%
Please,

1779
02:45:03.450 --> 02:45:05.420 line:82%
Not only is it difficult to catch Don...
