1
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.920 line:83%
Tell me again?

2
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.080 line:83%
Are you sure that's what happened?

3
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.120 line:83%
For God's sake.
Why do you need to report such stuff to me?

4
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.480 line:83%
Then what the hell is that HR Manager
I hired to head the Kalimantan office doing?

5
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.400 line:83%
Everywhere in the world,
workers are doing two things.

6
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.080 line:83%
Working or protesting.

7
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.000 line:83%
Don't take it too seriously.

8
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.360 line:83%
Fine.

9
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000 line:83%
In my opinion,
a successful leader should be an Alpha.

10
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.920 line:83%
It doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman
or called alpha female.

11
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.280 line:83%
And I am an alpha male.

12
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.760 line:83%
An alpha male is a decision maker.

13
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.360 line:83%
Weakness is not in my dictionary.

14
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.120 line:83%
- Honey, did mother call?
- Whose mother?

15
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.440 line:83%
- Yours!
- Why are you asking?

16
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.680 line:83%
I ran into her in the drug store.
I mean, I saw her.

17
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.880 line:83%
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.880 line:83%
I was at the cashier,
then I looked outside the window...

19
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.480 line:83%
...and saw her getting out of the car
and walking into the drug store.

20
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.320 line:83%
Then I ran to hide in the toilet
and I got so lucky...

21
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.320 line:83%
...there was a back door near it
and I ran out from the back door.

22
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.360 line:83%
Wait, wait.

23
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680 line:83%
Did you see my mother or a ghost?

24
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.280 line:83%
You don't take me seriously.

25
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.440 line:83%
I'm her son,
I have the right to feel offended.

26
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.880 line:83%
I'm sorry. But did I tell you
what I bought at the drug store?

27
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960 line:83%
- What?
- A pregnancy test.

28
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.720 line:83%
Then what does the pregnancy test have to do
with you seeing my mother or a ghost?

29
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.080 line:83%
- I didn't say that, you did.
- Whatever.

30
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.280 line:83%
- So?
- You know your mother.

31
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.800 line:83%
Whenever she gets a chance
She will surely ask if I was pregnant or not.

32
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.600 line:83%
If I'm late or not.

33
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.840 line:83%
If she had seen me buying a pregnancy test,
Then all hell would break loose.

34
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.400 line:83%
But are you sure it was my mother
you saw in the drug store?

35
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.280 line:83%
I still have 20/20 vision, my dear Alan.

36
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.320 line:83%
Which drug store?

37
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.280 line:83%
At the small business complex
across the street.

38
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.720 line:83%
But she lives 20 kilometers from here.

39
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.640 line:83%
What was she doing in that drug store?

40
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.680 line:83%
Could it be...

41
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.280 line:83%
Hello! Good morning!

42
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.520 line:83%
Just shoot me.

43
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.240 line:83%
Did you go to the drug store
across the street?

44
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.440 line:83%
As a matter of fact, yes.

45
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.400 line:83%
I knew it. I saw you exit from the back door.

46
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.080 line:83%
I tried to call you, but you looked
in a hurry to get into your car.

47
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.000 line:83%
Like you just saw a ghost.

48
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.800 line:83%
What were you doing in that drug store?
You ran out of your heart pills?

49
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.200 line:83%
I never run out of my heart pills.

50
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.400 line:83%
If I forget to take the pill just once,
my heartbeat would get out of control.

51
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.440 line:83%
I was going to buy you a pregnancy test.

52
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.440 line:83%
But the cashier said you already bought one,
so I put it back.

53
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.280 line:83%
The cashier had no business to tell
other customers about what she bought.

54
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.840 line:83%
I asked her!

55
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.200 line:83%
So, tell me. What's the result?

56
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.840 line:83%
We don't know yet. She just got home.

57
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.600 line:83%
How long has she been late? A month?

58
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.160 line:83%
- Just one week.
- But you're late, nonetheless.

59
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.040 line:83%
What are you waiting for? Go check.

60
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.200 line:83%
It can wait. Karti!
What do you want to drink?

61
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.280 line:83%
Hot tea? I bought
low calorie sugar just for you.

62
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.920 line:83%
What I want to drink is not important.

63
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.040 line:83%
No!

64
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.080 line:83%
Go on. Take the pregnancy test. Please?

65
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.760 line:83%
Hm?

66
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.160 line:83%
Always remember the motto:
"Mens sana in corpore sano."

67
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.640 line:83%
- "A healthy body in a healthy mind."
- It's the other way around.

68
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.720 line:83%
- "A healthy mind in a healthy body."
- Is it?

69
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.760 line:83%
My point is, you have to keep
your body and mind healthy.

70
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.120 line:83%
Especially you, Nadya.
Why don't you exercise like Alan?

71
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.640 line:83%
He has been playing basketball since junior high.

72
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.880 line:83%
Then he became captain
of his high school team.

73
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.600 line:83%
You just told her that story yesterday.

74
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.800 line:83%
My handsome son, a great story
needs to be told multiple times.

75
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.160 line:83%
Nadya, I know you love to exercise.
But please don't exercise too hard.

76
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.120 line:83%
You don't need to do that kind of
jumping around and screaming aerobics...

77
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.040 line:83%
...like you are possessed.

78
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.840 line:83%
Hey!

79
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.240 line:83%
Why don't you join my mother's Tai Chi group?

80
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.960 line:83%
Hey!

81
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.440 line:83%
I'm serious, don't joke around.

82
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.320 line:83%
And one more thing.

83
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.480 line:83%
I think Alan's salary is enough
to run your household.

84
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.200 line:83%
So you should quit your job.

85
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.400 line:83%
Working will make you tired
and stressed out.

86
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.080 line:83%
Low energy and stress
will decrease your fertility.

87
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.480 line:83%
- Mom.
- Huh?

88
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.280 line:83%
- You're getting old.
- What do you mean?

89
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.600 line:83%
Nadya quit her job almost a year ago.

90
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.000 line:83%
Really?

91
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.960 line:83%
- Then who's still working?
- How should I know?

92
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.200 line:83%
I'm going to make you something to drink.

93
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.400 line:83%
Hey!

94
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.280 line:83%
You better take her to a doctor
as soon as possible.

95
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.320 line:83%
There must be something wrong with your wife.

96
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.640 line:83%
Because I know that
you come from a fertile family.

97
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.760 line:83%
Your grandfather's first wife
and second wife gave him no children..

98
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.520 line:83%
But with his third wife,
he got nine children.

99
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.280 line:83%
And you yourself have five siblings.
Not having a child yet is just plain wrong.

100
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.840 line:83%
Alan.

101
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.160 line:83%
Honey.

102
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.480 line:83%
Honey!

103
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.240 line:83%
Hm?

104
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.680 line:83%
Let's go to a doctor.

105
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.840 line:83%
Hah?

106
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.960 line:83%
What's wrong? Are you sick?

107
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.160 line:83%
No, I mean to an ob-gyn.

108
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.960 line:83%
Let's make sure that there's nothing wrong
with both of us.

109
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.640 line:83%
Why are you so reluctant?

110
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.840 line:83%
I'm not...

111
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.720 line:83%
...but I just don't like the idea
of doing what everybody's doing.

112
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.840 line:83%
I don't understand.

113
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.840 line:83%
A new couple will have a baby
in 1 or 2 years after they get married.

114
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.520 line:83%
But should they have a baby in that time frame?

115
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.000 line:83%
Some couples have a baby after 5 or 6 years
after they get married.

116
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.440 line:83%
Some even after 10 years.

117
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.160 line:83%
We've just been married for 3 years.

118
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.480 line:83%
Don't you feel uncomfortable
whenever she asks if I'm already pregnant or not?

119
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.320 line:83%
You mother does it every 3 weeks
without fail.

120
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.760 line:83%
"Are you pregnant now? Are you pregnant now?"

121
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.560 line:83%
Not to mention during family events.

122
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.960 line:83%
She makes me more stressed out
instead of happy.

123
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.240 line:83%
Okay, let's go to a doctor.

124
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.400 line:83%
But...

125
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.200 line:83%
...you have to be ready to hear
whatever the result is.

126
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.880 line:83%
Like maybe...

127
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.680 line:83%
...when it confirms my mom's suspicion.

128
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.880 line:83%
You mean whether I can bear a child?

129
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.520 line:83%
Why did you park here?

130
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.400 line:83%
Because the other cars
are parked over there.

131
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.800 line:83%
That's what I mean by
doing what everybody's doing.

132
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.080 line:83%
Not again.

133
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.640 line:83%
- Ouch.
- What?

134
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.080 line:83%
I need to pee.

135
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.280 line:83%
That face looks familiar.

136
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.960 line:83%
- The male or the female?
- The male.

137
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.720 line:83%
One of your exes maybe?
You were popular among men.

138
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.920 line:83%
You always hung out with band members.

139
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.000 line:83%
- I know, I know.
- You've been avoiding me.

140
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:10.040 line:83%
I'm not avoiding you.
I'm in the office, I'm working!

141
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.240 line:83%
I don't feel comfortable
taking personal calls.

142
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.040 line:83%
Shut up, bitch.

143
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.480 line:83%
Don't you dare use foul language with me.
Because I can do it better than you.

144
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.800 line:83%
You're an asshole!

145
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.840 line:83%
Good afternoon.

146
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.200 line:83%
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

147
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.480 line:83%
Where's the toilet?

148
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.880 line:83%
Go down that hall, the toilet is to the left.

149
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.840 line:83%
Go down the hall, to the left? Thanks.

150
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.240 line:83%
You're welcome.

151
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.680 line:83%
Do you have an appointment with Dr. Sanjaya?

152
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.560 line:83%
- Yes.
- Let me check his schedule.

153
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.920 line:83%
- Your name, please?
- Alan.

154
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.160 line:83%
Alan.

155
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.400 line:83%
Is the appointment for today?

156
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.080 line:83%
Yes. Why? Doesn't it show in your system?

157
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.640 line:83%
Hold on. What’s ma’am’s name?

158
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.800 line:83%
- Fatimah.
- Fatimah.

159
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.440 line:83%
I can't find that name either.

160
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.720 line:83%
Because I didn't make the appointment
under my mother's name.

161
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.560 line:83%
Fatimah is your mother's name?

162
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.920 line:83%
I mean your wife's name.

163
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.240 line:83%
Sorry. It's Nadya.

164
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.520 line:83%
Nadya.

165
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.240 line:83%
Um...

166
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.960 line:83%
It’s very rare nowadays to find a guy who blurts out
his mother's name on reflex.

167
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.440 line:83%
Well...

168
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.480 line:83%
She comes to our house all the time.

169
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.720 line:83%
That's why I get confused
between both of them sometimes.

170
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.560 line:83%
How nice to have such a close relationship
with your mother.

171
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.400 line:83%
Sometimes it can be a pain in the neck.

172
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.520 line:83%
I think no mother would do such a thing
to her own son.

173
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.560 line:83%
Um... My wife's decision to come here
was encouraged by my mother too.

174
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.280 line:83%
That's not a pain in the neck.

175
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.560 line:83%
It's her wish to see you happy.

176
00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.320 line:83%
Amen.

177
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.880 line:83%
Next June all heavy machines
should be ready to install the piles.

178
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.840 line:83%
Yes, Sir.

179
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.000 line:83%
If we can't handle such a small project
it would cause a backlog for our next projects.

180
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.320 line:83%
I see.

181
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.600 line:83%
Thank you, Sir.

182
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.640 line:83%
- Say hi to everybody out there.
- Okay.

183
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.440 line:83%
Did you say something?

184
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.000 line:83%
There's a problem with my late father's land deed
in Kebayoran Lama.

185
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.280 line:83%
Why are you suddenly talking about the inheritance land?

186
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.720 line:83%
We can get a lot of money if we sell it.

187
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.760 line:83%
It can pay for our IVF treatment.

188
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.160 line:83%
I told you, I saved up enough money for that.
Don't worry.

189
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.600 line:83%
But it's so expensive.

190
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.640 line:83%
What if it fails?

191
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.200 line:83%
At least we tried.
We have to sacrifice. Okay?

192
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.040 line:83%
Mister and Missus,
this is your first appointment with me, right?

193
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.400 line:83%
The reason for you not having a baby yet
can be a lot of things.

194
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:32.920 line:83%
But the most important thing is
that we should know the underlying problem.

195
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.760 line:83%
Maybe you have an undeteced illness,
or genetic mutation disease.

196
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.760 line:83%
That could be dangerous.

197
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.480 line:83%
Or maybe the problem is with your husband.

198
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:48.520 line:83%
Maybe your husband's sperms are too weak...

199
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.080 line:83%
...and unable to swim through your cervix.

200
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:58.840 line:83%
Your eggs might be ready for the sperm,
but it just didn't happen.

201
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:04.000 line:83%
In order to get the proper treatment,
we have to do some observations.

202
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.160 line:83%
That way we can decide
what the next step would be.

203
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.400 line:83%
Why didn't you get yourself tested too?

204
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.560 line:83%
It's better we tackle one problem at a time.

205
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.040 line:83%
My first priority is you.

206
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.960 line:83%
After we get the lab result,
then we can go on with my test.

207
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.400 line:83%
The doctor didn't say that.

208
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.080 line:83%
I think we don't need to do
what the doctor said literally.

209
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.320 line:83%
He owns the clinic.

210
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.880 line:83%
It's normal if he wants us
to do all the tests there.

211
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.000 line:83%
The more tests they do,
the more money they get.

212
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.960 line:83%
Then why are we wasting time
in the first place?

213
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.480 line:83%
I'll do it, but not now. Okay?

214
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.200 line:83%
Whatever.

215
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.280 line:83%
If you're so reluctant,
then let's not go back.

216
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.880 line:83%
Have you lost it? Control your anger, Nadya.

217
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.200 line:83%
Holding in your anger will make you explode.

218
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.600 line:83%
- You sound like those me-mes.
- It's pronounced memes.

219
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.960 line:83%
Me-mes.

220
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.320 line:83%
Dr. Sanjaya's clinic. Good evening.

221
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.680 line:83%
Good evening.

222
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.600 line:83%
This is Alan,
a patient from this afternoon's appointment.

223
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.600 line:83%
Mr. Alan, son of Mrs. Fatimah?

224
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.320 line:83%
You still remember. I'm embarrassed.

225
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.040 line:83%
Of course, I still remember you.
How may I help you?

226
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.160 line:83%
I'm just curious.
When can I get tested for my sperms?

227
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.320 line:83%
I got everything ready for you
when you were here.

228
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.400 line:83%
But when I went looking for you,
I couldn't find you.

229
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.200 line:83%
How about tomorrow? 2 p.m. okay?

230
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.560 line:83%
Um...

231
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.840 line:83%
Of course, Sir.

232
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.320 line:83%
Sorry, who am I speaking with?

233
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.000 line:83%
- It's Andien.
- Thank you, Andien.

234
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.760 line:83%
You're welcome, Mr. Alan.
I'll see you tomorrow.

235
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.720 line:83%
- Oh, it's just you.
- Why?

236
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.560 line:83%
I heard noises and I thought we had a guest.

237
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.000 line:83%
It was me on the phone.
A staff called. From the office.

238
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.640 line:83%
- Good afternoon, Andien.
- Excuse me. Good afternoon.

239
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.240 line:83%
- Are you here for the test?
- Can I ask a few questions first?

240
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.720 line:83%
Sure.

241
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.600 line:83%
Is it going to hurt?

242
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.040 line:83%
Do you use a needle or...?

243
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.320 line:83%
No, we don't. You're going to do it yourself.

244
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.360 line:83%
- I have to do it myself?
- Yes.

245
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.200 line:83%
Or your wife can help if you want.

246
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.480 line:83%
Oh?

247
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.280 line:83%
- She hasn't come with you?
- No.

248
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.760 line:83%
Then you can do it yourself.

249
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:12.840 line:83%
We have a private room back there
where you can do it undisturbed.

250
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.720 line:83%
But you have to do it by yourself.

251
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.160 line:83%
I don't understand.

252
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.360 line:83%
You know. You. Doing it. Yourself.

253
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.800 line:83%
So, let me just show you the room.

254
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.040 line:83%
Are you sure
there's no surveillance camera in here?

255
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.960 line:83%
Now, sit down, and relax.

256
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.640 line:83%
You look so tense.

257
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.600 line:83%
I...

258
00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.440 line:83%
My friends call me Miss Confidante.

259
00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.200 line:83%
Because they can easily talk
about private matters with me.

260
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.320 line:83%
So you can tell me anything if you want to.

261
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.200 line:83%
I'm worried.

262
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.960 line:83%
Worried? About what?

263
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.360 line:83%
I was a player.

264
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.680 line:83%
I had many girlfriends.

265
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.280 line:83%
And all of my exes always wanted...

266
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.880 line:83%
...to make love to me.

267
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.160 line:83%
They wanted to get pregnant with me,
so I would marry them.

268
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.800 line:83%
I'm not surprised.

269
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.800 line:83%
You're good looking.

270
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.400 line:83%
Every woman would want to marry you.

271
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.120 line:83%
But the problem is that
nobody got pregnant by me.

272
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.080 line:83%
And once they broke up with me
they got pregnant with their new boyfriend.

273
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.760 line:83%
Or after they got married to another man.

274
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:05.120 line:83%
The only girlfriend who didn't want
premarital sex was my wife.

275
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.760 line:83%
I see.

276
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.160 line:83%
And she's still not pregnant
after three years of marriage.

277
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.960 line:83%
So when you get the lab result,
call me first.

278
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.320 line:83%
Don't show it to the doctor yet.

279
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.360 line:83%
Why not?
He's the one who's going to read it to you.

280
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.960 line:83%
You must know who's in charge
in the lab, right?

281
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.760 line:83%
They're the people
who test the sample, right?

282
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.120 line:83%
Please?

283
00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.960 line:83%
Fine. Now, fill this cup.

284
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.560 line:83%
Just enough for testing.

285
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.280 line:83%
Can you do it alone?

286
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.280 line:83%
Yes, I can.

287
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.680 line:83%
Are you sure?

288
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.120 line:83%
Yes, I am.

289
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.520 line:83%
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

290
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.920 line:83%
You're home early.

291
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.040 line:83%
Today's work went smoothly,
why do I have to stay in the office?

292
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.280 line:83%
- Did you stop by the clinic?
- I did.

293
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.720 line:83%
Then?

294
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.880 line:83%
I did it for you.

295
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.880 line:83%
Don't say that. It's for us.

296
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.000 line:83%
Let's hope for the best.

297
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.040 line:83%
Amen.

298
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.640 line:83%
Hello.

299
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.480 line:83%
Don't use language that I do not understand.

300
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.920 line:83%
Just tell me the truth. Am I fertile or not?

301
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.840 line:83%
Sir, being sterile is not a death sentence
in the medical world.

302
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.280 line:83%
Then what is it?

303
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.440 line:83%
Your sperm count
which are healthy is too low.

304
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:38.680 line:83%
And they're too weak to penetrate into the egg.

305
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.800 line:83%
Andien, we need to meet.

306
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.560 line:83%
Where are you going?

307
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.240 line:83%
You don't look well.

308
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.320 line:83%
The Manager from the Kalimantan office has
asked to meet.

309
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.280 line:83%
Is it serious?

310
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.120 line:83%
Very, very serious.

311
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.480 line:83%
Do you know what time you're going to be home?

312
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.000 line:83%
I don't know.

313
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.720 line:83%
Bye.

314
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.680 line:83%
Do you come here often?

315
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.920 line:83%
This is my first time.

316
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.440 line:83%
You look so comfortable here.

317
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.680 line:83%
I'm no stranger to small bars.

318
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.960 line:83%
But this is the first time
I have come to this bar.

319
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.440 line:83%
I can't make it a habit because it will
cost me a week's lunch money per visit.

320
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.400 line:83%
You're funny.

321
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.720 line:83%
How about you?

322
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.000 line:83%
Never been here before.

323
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.760 line:83%
I'll have what she ordered.

324
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.960 line:83%
Okay.

325
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.320 line:83%
You love competition, don't you, Sir?

326
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.280 line:83%
- Don't call me Sir here.
- Here you go.

327
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.680 line:83%
Thank you.

328
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.680 line:83%
It’s ok, so we seem like a married couple.

329
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.840 line:83%
"Let's sleep, Sir."
"Let's drink, Sir."

330
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.480 line:83%
- I think you're already drunk.
- Not really. I just took a few sips.

331
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.360 line:83%
Trust me, I'm still sober.

332
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.440 line:83%
How come you asked me out tonight?

333
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.280 line:83%
Did you miss me?

334
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.920 line:83%
I'm going to offer you a business deal.

335
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.440 line:83%
A business deal?

336
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.760 line:83%
Of what kind?
Is it some kind of pyramid scheme?

337
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.280 line:83%
No.

338
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:09.120 line:83%
I'm going to pay you to change
the lab result from infertile to fertile.

339
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.440 line:83%
Then give the fake report to the doctor.

340
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.880 line:83%
Are you ashamed that
you can't get your wife pregnant?

341
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.560 line:83%
Shh!

342
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.440 line:83%
Do you really want me to say it out loud?

343
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.120 line:83%
Are you sure you want to pay me to do it?

344
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.200 line:83%
Yes.

345
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.520 line:83%
How much are you going to pay me?

346
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.480 line:83%
Five million.

347
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.880 line:83%
What?

348
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.840 line:83%
That's too little.

349
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.880 line:83%
How about 10 million?

350
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.000 line:83%
I am late on my credit card payment.

351
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.600 line:83%
I'm so tired of receiving calls
from debt collectors.

352
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.280 line:83%
- But can you do it?
- But I want 10 million.

353
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.920 line:83%
Okay.

354
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.400 line:83%
The result is good.

355
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.040 line:83%
Your sperm count is satisfactory.

356
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.080 line:83%
They are plenty and very active.

357
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.560 line:83%
Now, let's get our focus on you, Ma'am.

358
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.920 line:83%
The treatment will be in a few steps.

359
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.040 line:83%
It's going to take time to find out
why there has been no conception yet.

360
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.800 line:83%
- I'm ready, doc.
- Okay.

361
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.680 line:83%
We've been doing business
with the heavy machine vendor for years.

362
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.640 line:83%
Don't switch to a new one.

363
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.800 line:83%
Okay.

364
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.040 line:83%
Can you lift up your blouse a bit, Ma'am?

365
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.800 line:83%
Very good.

366
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.040 line:83%
This is your result.

367
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.280 line:83%
Thank you.

368
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.240 line:83%
- Nadya?
- Athar! How are you?

369
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.720 line:83%
Then I was right when I thought I saw you
from our car in the parking lot.

370
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.280 line:83%
- I just wasn't sure.
- This clinic parking lot?

371
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.200 line:83%
Yeah. You haven't aged one bit.

372
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.520 line:83%
- Do you mean I'm still handsome?
- Don't flatter yourself.

373
00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.240 line:83%
- By the way, where's Alan?
- I have come alone.

374
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.080 line:83%
I see...

375
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.160 line:83%
But he's still...

376
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.520 line:83%
- Still my husband?
- Yes.

377
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.960 line:83%
Of course he's still my husband!

378
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.880 line:83%
Are you still waiting for me?

379
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.320 line:83%
Just like a quote from trucks.
"Right here waiting."

380
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.160 line:83%
- What are you doing here?
- I'm picking up my wife's medicines.

381
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.120 line:83%
- You're on the treatment program too?
- Yes, the first step. How about you?

382
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.360 line:83%
Same. It's been three years
and no child calls me "Mama" yet.

383
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.280 line:83%
Me neither, still no baby to hold.

384
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.240 line:83%
Who knew we would be in the same boat.

385
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.960 line:83%
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

386
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.320 line:83%
- Did you go to the clinic today?
- Yes.

387
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.920 line:83%
Do you know who I ran into at the clinic?

388
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.040 line:83%
- Athar your ex-boyfriend?
- Yeah.

389
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.200 line:83%
- At the clinic?
- Yeah. He's on the fertility program too.

390
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.160 line:83%
I bet he was thrilled to see you.

391
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.240 line:83%
It's been 10 years
since the last time we met.

392
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.320 line:83%
He send regards for you.

393
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.040 line:83%
How's his wife?

394
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.560 line:83%
- He was there alone.
- He was?

395
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.680 line:83%
I see...

396
00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.840 line:83%
How convenient.

397
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.440 line:83%
According to... Excuse me.

398
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:52.320 line:83%
Can we talk about it tomorrow?
I'm with a patient. Okay?

399
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.640 line:83%
I'm more comfortable taking calls on speaker.

400
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:05.280 line:83%
Your physical health...

401
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.920 line:83%
...is all around good.

402
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.560 line:83%
Your hormone level is also normal.

403
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.240 line:83%
Your ovaries are healthy too.

404
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:19.080 line:83%
So if there's a problem conceiving...

405
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.200 line:83%
...then it must be from a specific reason.

406
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:28.280 line:83%
For example, if your body rejects
your husband's sperms.

407
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.040 line:83%
So when Mr. Alan's sperms swim up your ovaries,
they get rejected.

408
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:38.120 line:83%
And that's why the conception fails.

409
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.040 line:83%
Is there a way to treat this condition?

410
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.600 line:83%
You can do in-vitro fertilisation.

411
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:50.120 line:83%
So the conception is done in the lab.

412
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.400 line:83%
How do you do that?

413
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.560 line:83%
In a test tube.

414
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.800 line:83%
Are you okay?

415
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.840 line:83%
I'm okay.

416
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.280 line:83%
- I'm so sorry, doc.
- It's okay.

417
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.800 line:83%
Hello.

418
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.000 line:83%
The doctor gave us the idea to do in-vitro Fertilisation.

419
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.880 line:83%
I thought you're still consulting
with the doctor in his office?

420
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.840 line:83%
My wife's still in there.

421
00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.640 line:83%
And where are you now?

422
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.720 line:83%
I guess, you're in the toilet?

423
00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.800 line:83%
It doesn't matter where I am now.
But I'm screwed.

424
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.720 line:83%
My wife agreed immediately with his idea.

425
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.720 line:83%
- I think that's a good idea.
- No, it's not!

426
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.800 line:83%
That means I need to collect
another sperm sample.

427
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.080 line:83%
Well...

428
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.920 line:83%
So collect another sample.

429
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.680 line:83%
I’ll be more than happy to help.

430
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.240 line:83%
I'm not talking about that.

431
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.800 line:83%
I'm talking about faking another lab result.

432
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.760 line:83%
Um...

433
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.440 line:83%
You can pay me another 5 million.

434
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.120 line:83%
Stop joking. I'm dead serious.

435
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:03.880 line:83%
Listen, you can only use your fake lab result
to brag to your wife...

436
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.040 line:83%
...that your sperm count is normal
and you're a healthy man.

437
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.400 line:83%
It's not just for my wife.

438
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.560 line:83%
I'm an employer with many employees
and I come from a fertile family.

439
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.560 line:83%
But you need the real data
for this kind of treatment.

440
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.960 line:83%
Honey?

441
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.240 line:83%
I have to go. Your wife's here.

442
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.800 line:83%
Are you done with your consultation
with the doctor?

443
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.360 line:83%
Yes, but have you seen my husband?

444
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.320 line:83%
Um...

445
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.400 line:83%
I thought he was inside with you?

446
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.080 line:83%
He was, but he went out before me.

447
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.040 line:83%
Maybe he's in the toilet?

448
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.720 line:83%
There he is.

449
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.160 line:83%
Honey, let's hope for the best.

450
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.800 line:83%
Yes, let's talk about it later, okay?

451
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.560 line:83%
What do you mean?

452
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.080 line:83%
Let's go home.

453
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.280 line:83%
Do you remember when our next appointment
with the doctor will be?

454
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000 line:83%
He said after you finish
all your medicines.

455
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.640 line:83%
I forgot.

456
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.800 line:83%
Just don't forget what I told you.

457
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.600 line:83%
If you feel that God doesn't answer
your prayer...

458
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.680 line:83%
...don't get discouraged.

459
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.200 line:83%
I won't. I remember.

460
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.360 line:83%
Thank you.

461
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.920 line:83%
Doctor Sanjaya's Clinic. Good afternoon.

462
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.040 line:83%
Good afternoon. This is Nadya.

463
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.320 line:83%
Mrs. Nadya, how can I help you?

464
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.800 line:83%
Can I reschedule the observation appointment?

465
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.400 line:83%
Of course, no problem. I will help you to reschedule.

466
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.160 line:83%
I just...

467
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.480 line:83%
I just don't understand my husband's reaction.

468
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.760 line:83%
The solution is there right in front of him,
but now he seems confused.

469
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.400 line:83%
Is he having second thoughts
about the IVF treatment program?

470
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.160 line:83%
Yeah, he said it's not reliable. This and that excuses..

471
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.400 line:83%
There's nothing certain in the world
before it happens.

472
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.640 line:83%
I know.

473
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.160 line:83%
It's going to break my heart
if this treatment fails.

474
00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.560 line:83%
I think it's the only way for me
to have a baby.

475
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.080 line:83%
Ma'am.

476
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.400 line:83%
I'm sorry you have to hear my rants.

477
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.120 line:83%
I hope you understand how I feel.

478
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.520 line:83%
I do understand.

479
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.960 line:83%
Will you pray for me?

480
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.880 line:83%
Yes, Ma'am. I will.

481
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.720 line:83%
Don't talk about coal price crashing
with the workers.

482
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.080 line:83%
They don't care about any of that shit.

483
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.760 line:83%
But they care if you cut their lunch money.

484
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.240 line:83%
Okay.

485
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.360 line:83%
Take care of that.

486
00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.960 line:83%
- Here's your coffee, Sir.
- Thank you.

487
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240 line:83%
Hello.

488
00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.080 line:83%
Mr. Alan, I feel sorry for your wife.

489
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.800 line:83%
She called here and was sounding very upset.

490
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.800 line:83%
She's relying on the IVF treatment.

491
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.200 line:83%
Hey, babe.

492
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.520 line:83%
Why did you tell Andien everything?

493
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.920 line:83%
- Who's Andien?
- The receptionist in Dr. Sanjaya's clinic.

494
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.960 line:83%
How do you know her name?

495
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.160 line:83%
I saw her name tag on her chest.

496
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.680 line:83%
So you were looking at her chest?

497
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.240 line:83%
I wasn't looking at her chest.

498
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.680 line:83%
I was just reading her name tag
pinned on her pocket.

499
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.720 line:83%
And you had to read what's on that pin?

500
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.440 line:83%
Did you really need to know her name?

501
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.680 line:83%
Why are we talking about her?

502
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.360 line:83%
Okay, I talked to her.

503
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.600 line:83%
I said I want to go on with the treatment.

504
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.520 line:83%
Is there any other reason why you seem
to hesitate to do the treatment?

505
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.680 line:83%
- Hello?
- Yes, okay.

506
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.000 line:83%
Okay, you'll do it?

507
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.720 line:83%
Yes, let's do it.

508
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.880 line:83%
Great!

509
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.880 line:83%
Let's not dwell in our failures,
and let's do our best...

510
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.600 line:83%
...and pray the treatment works.

511
00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.600 line:83%
Nadya?

512
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.400 line:83%
Morning.

513
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.080 line:83%
Where have you been?

514
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.600 line:83%
I was working out and then went to buy groceries.

515
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.320 line:83%
Since when do you work out?

516
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.240 line:83%
Dr. Sanjaya said I should spend
more time in the sun...

517
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.360 line:83%
...breathe morning air to be fit
before starting the treatment.

518
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.080 line:83%
You don't have to do anything.
You're a strong man with perfect sperms.

519
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.120 line:83%
Going somewhere?

520
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.080 line:83%
I was planning to go look for you.

521
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.880 line:83%
I thought you were going to the clinic.
It's too early.

522
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.240 line:83%
Your appointment is at 11 a.m.

523
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.120 line:83%
What appointment?

524
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.080 line:83%
You forgot already?
They need your sperm sample.

525
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.080 line:83%
I also need another appointment
with Dr. Sanjaya.

526
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.240 line:83%
- You're coming with me?
- Yes, is that okay?

527
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.080 line:83%
Okay.

528
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.560 line:83%
- Because you're so mean to me!
- I don't care!

529
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.520 line:83%
- You just love to see me suffer!
- Of course!

530
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.880 line:83%
- You're happy to make me angry!
- Yes, very happy indeed!

531
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.960 line:83%
- Crazy woman!
- You're crazy!

532
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.800 line:83%
Good afternoon, Miss Andien.

533
00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.160 line:83%
Good afternoon.

534
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.000 line:83%
Are you here for your appointment?

535
00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.200 line:83%
Yes.

536
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.040 line:83%
Do you want to see the doctor now?
Or do you want to help your husband first?

537
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.520 line:83%
Can you do it alone?
I'm going to see the doctor.

538
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.560 line:83%
- Is he with a patient right now?
- No, you can wait in his room.

539
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640 line:83%
Okay.

540
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.800 line:83%
- Good luck!
- Thank you!

541
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.480 line:83%
- This is just a waste of time, isn't it?
- Hang on, Sir.

542
00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.440 line:83%
You still want the program to work, right?

543
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.440 line:83%
I still have a chance?

544
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.560 line:83%
Listen, Sir.

545
00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.200 line:83%
Nothing is impossible if you just believe.

546
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.240 line:83%
If you have faith,
then you have a healthy mind.

547
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.400 line:83%
And a healthy mind will help you
to produce healthy sperms.

548
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.880 line:83%
- Are you sure?
- A hundred percent.

549
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.920 line:83%
You and your wife should go on
with the plan I made for you.

550
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.280 line:83%
I guarantee, the treatment will work.

551
00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.640 line:83%
You can guarantee it?

552
00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.920 line:83%
Yes.

553
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.880 line:83%
You really can guarantee it?

554
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.080 line:83%
Let's make a bet.

555
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.560 line:83%
What's the bet?

556
00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.840 line:83%
Um...

557
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.520 line:83%
If the treatment works,
you have to pay me 50 million.

558
00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.520 line:83%
If it fails?

559
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.280 line:83%
Um...

560
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.600 line:83%
You can ask whatever you want from me.

561
00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.840 line:83%
But not money. I don't have any money.

562
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.920 line:83%
Okay?

563
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.240 line:83%
3 Months Later

564
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.040 line:83%
Look.

565
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.400 line:83%
They're getting bigger.

566
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.600 line:83%
- Where?
- This.

567
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.120 line:83%
And this.

568
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.880 line:83%
Wait, there are two of them?

569
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.800 line:83%
Two babies called twins.

570
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.240 line:83%
Three babies called triplets.

571
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.760 line:83%
Four babies called quadruplets.
And so on...

572
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.640 line:83%
- We're going to have twins?
- Yes, you're going to have twins.

573
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.280 line:83%
Honey. We're going to have twins.

574
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.800 line:83%
- Twins!
- Twins?

575
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.240 line:83%
Hey.

576
00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.880 line:83%
It's okay.

577
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.440 line:83%
There, there.

578
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.560 line:83%
Hi!

579
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.960 line:83%
Look at the hot daddy.

580
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.120 line:83%
Hey.

581
00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.760 line:83%
What did you do?
You said my sperm count is low.

582
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.680 line:83%
What did I tell you?

583
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.600 line:83%
Nothing is impossible if you just believe.

584
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.840 line:83%
I'll have what he ordered.

585
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.840 line:83%
That's nonsense.

586
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.440 line:83%
I didn't believe my wife could get pregnant
after you said that to me, but she is now.

587
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.120 line:83%
Maybe this is what happened.

588
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.320 line:83%
Your sperm quality might be generally bad.

589
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:28.240 line:83%
But the doctor can pick
the best sperms and the best eggs.

590
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.520 line:83%
That's why the treatment worked.

591
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.720 line:83%
Yes!

592
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.800 line:83%
Sir, I know our deal has ended...

593
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.640 line:83%
...but can we still be friends?

594
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.640 line:83%
Let's celebrate.

595
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.080 line:83%
Give us your most expensive bottle.

596
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:47.200 line:83%
- Is that all you can do?
- I'm not done. I'm just a little bit tipsy.

597
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.800 line:83%
Okay.

598
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.080 line:83%
Slow down.

599
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.920 line:83%
Ugh, stairs.

600
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.720 line:83%
- Slowly. One...
- One...

601
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.600 line:83%
- Jinx!
- ...two, three.

602
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.680 line:83%
What's so funny? Why are you laughing at me?

603
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.280 line:83%
Because you're funny.

604
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.320 line:83%
Am I funny or am I stupid?

605
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.640 line:83%
You finally found out.

606
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.360 line:83%
Why do you think I'm stupid?

607
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:26.680 line:83%
Because you're easily duped by women.

608
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.040 line:83%
Who fooled me? You?

609
00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.600 line:83%
Are you that gullible?

610
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.800 line:83%
I think you're the only woman
who has ever duped me. Am I right?

611
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.280 line:83%
How did you get my wife pregnant?

612
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.320 line:83%
Your wife is very fertile.

613
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:55.000 line:83%
She just needed a good sperm
to get her pregnant.

614
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.400 line:83%
But you knew I got low quality sperms.

615
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.240 line:83%
That's why I swapped the cup.

616
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.520 line:83%
With whose did you swap my cup?

617
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.520 line:83%
The curiosity is killing you!

618
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.520 line:83%
- Tell me, whose sperm samples?
- Another patient!

619
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.920 line:83%
- Who!?
- Athar.

620
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.320 line:83%
Ouch!

621
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.880 line:83%
Andien?

622
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.200 line:83%
Your wife needs a CT scan
to check out her injuries.

623
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.160 line:83%
Sorry, she's not my wife.

624
00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.800 line:83%
I'm sorry. Can you sign here?

625
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.760 line:83%
Thank you.

626
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.320 line:83%
- Excuse me, doctor.
- Go ahead.

627
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320 line:83%
Hello.

628
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.600 line:83%
Where are you? It's very late.

629
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.800 line:83%
A staff member just had an accident.

630
00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.960 line:83%
Who?

631
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.080 line:83%
I just arrived at the hospital.
I didn't get a chance to call you.

632
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.080 line:83%
Are you going to be home late?

633
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.120 line:83%
I think so.

634
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.480 line:83%
All right, drive safe.

635
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.560 line:83%
I will.

636
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.360 line:83%
Hello.

637
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.640 line:83%
Who are you? Where's Andien?

638
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.120 line:83%
- I'm her friend.
- Where is she?

639
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.640 line:83%
She's in the hospital now.

640
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.200 line:83%
What happened to her?

641
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.280 line:83%
- She had an accident.
- How did it happen?

642
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.720 line:83%
You'd better come here immediately.
She's in the ER at Seroja Hospital.

643
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.160 line:83%
Are you okay?

644
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.920 line:83%
I'm feeling sick since afternoon.

645
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.200 line:83%
Do you want to make an appointment
with the doctor for tomorrow?

646
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.160 line:83%
No, I think it's normal when you're pregnant.

647
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.560 line:83%
I don't want the doctor to laugh at me.

648
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.760 line:83%
What's wrong?

649
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.920 line:83%
I'm just tired.

650
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.680 line:83%
Sometimes, I feel like I'm dreaming.

651
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.760 line:83%
Just when I started getting used to people
asking me about getting pregnant.

652
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.680 line:83%
Now people are congratulating me
for my pregnancy.

653
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.840 line:83%
Let's make a bet.

654
00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.920 line:83%
Do you think we're going to have
two boys or two girls?

655
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.160 line:83%
Or maybe one of each gender.
It could happen, right?

656
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.440 line:83%
But I don't care about their gender,
I just want them to be healthy.

657
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.480 line:83%
Can you come home straight from work?
I don't want to be alone tonight.

658
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.440 line:83%
And can you stop by the grocery store
on your way home and buy me lobi-lobi fruit?

659
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.840 line:83%
Okay.

660
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.000 line:83%
So the heavy machines for installing
the piles are ready.

661
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.080 line:83%
Yes, Sir.

662
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.040 line:83%
All right, I think that's all for today.

663
00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.160 line:83%
Thank you, Mr. Henry, Miss Dewi,
Donny, Cynthia.

664
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.480 line:83%
Thank you, Sir.

665
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.920 line:83%
Honey, your phone's ringing,
but from an unknown number.

666
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.960 line:83%
I wonder who it is.

667
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.800 line:83%
Maybe it's an important call.

668
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.160 line:83%
Thanks, honey.

669
00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.240 line:83%
Hello?

670
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.720 line:83%
Is this Athar?

671
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.360 line:83%
Yes, who's this?

672
00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.720 line:83%
It's Alan.

673
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.160 line:83%
- Alan?
- Alan Alpha.

674
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.520 line:83%
Is that you, bro? How are you?

675
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.920 line:83%
Not so good.

676
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.320 line:83%
Where did you get my number from?

677
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.680 line:83%
It's a long story...

678
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.200 line:83%
...and I don't need to tell you about it.

679
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.320 line:83%
What a surprise. What's up?

680
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.200 line:83%
So there was a follow up meeting
after you ran into my wife?

681
00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.600 line:83%
Oh.

682
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.160 line:83%
At the clinic? I ran into Nadya.
She told you that, didn't she?

683
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.120 line:83%
She did.

684
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.920 line:83%
But not everything.

685
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240 line:83%
Um...

686
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.600 line:83%
What do you mean?

687
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.240 line:83%
We're no longer college students.

688
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.280 line:83%
Both of us have a partner.

689
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.720 line:83%
They're more than just girlfriends.
They're our wives.

690
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.240 line:83%
Shame on you for having an affair
behind my back...

691
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.640 line:83%
...and acting like nothing happened.

692
00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:28.800 line:83%
Wait, wait.
I don't understand any of the words you just said.

693
00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.640 line:83%
We've lost contact for so many years...

694
00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:37.880 line:83%
...and then one day you call me
and talk about something I know nothing about.

695
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.400 line:83%
Why don't you straight up tell me
what's going on and stop the riddle.

696
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.360 line:83%
Tell me the truth.

697
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.440 line:83%
What did you do to my wife
behind my back?

698
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.880 line:83%
Are you accusing me
of having an affair with Nadya?

699
00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.760 line:83%
I know you don't have the guts
to do it in person.

700
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.600 line:83%
But what you did to destroy
my credibility as a husband...

701
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.040 line:83%
...is brilliant, I must admit.

702
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.720 line:83%
What are you talking about?

703
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.480 line:83%
My wife is pregnant with sperm samples
from Dr. Sanjaya's patient...

704
00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.880 line:83%
...and the patient's name is Athar.

705
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.160 line:83%
And you're the only Athar in the clinic.

706
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.320 line:83%
It could have only happened if you were conspiring
with some staff in the clinic...

707
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.400 line:83%
...to put your sperms into Nadya's egg cells
in her IVF treatment program.

708
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.840 line:83%
When we were in college...

709
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.960 line:83%
...Nadya, Alan and I were friends
from the same faculty.

710
00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.720 line:83%
We hung out, but only occasionally.

711
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.000 line:83%
And you know, when your group
has both genders in it...

712
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.680 line:83%
...it's hard to keep it just friends.

713
00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.240 line:83%
Love always sparks.

714
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:58.120 line:83%
Alan and I were competing to win Nadys's heart
without even realizing it.

715
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.320 line:83%
But Nadya chose me.

716
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.960 line:83%
Tell me the truth.

717
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.600 line:83%
Are you having an affair with her?

718
00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.320 line:83%
- Of course not. Why would I do that?
- So you can have a baby with her.

719
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.720 line:83%
That's impossible.

720
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.520 line:83%
Because you know...

721
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.920 line:83%
I can't have children...

722
00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.560 line:83%
...and you can...

723
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.800 line:83%
No, no. Stop bringing up that subject.

724
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.320 line:83%
Honey.

725
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.040 line:83%
I want you to remember my vow.

726
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:51.600 line:83%
No matter what, with or without children...

727
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.440 line:83%
...you're the only woman in my life.
I want you to remember that.

728
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.720 line:83%
Then we should make an appointment
with Dr. Sanjaya to make everything clear.

729
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.360 line:83%
Yes for sure.

730
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.200 line:83%
I'm sorry for this inconvenience.

731
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:28.240 line:83%
Sanjaya's Clinic is running
with the highest SOP.

732
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.080 line:83%
We have a high standard of integrity
because we have to keep our reputation...

733
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.480 line:83%
...as a luxury fertility clinic.

734
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.280 line:83%
So once again, it's just nonsense.

735
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.000 line:83%
But what if that really happened?

736
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.960 line:83%
Wait here.

737
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.960 line:83%
Excuse me, we want to make
an appointment with Dr. Sanjaya.

738
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.320 line:83%
Athar.

739
00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.480 line:83%
Nadya.

740
00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.400 line:83%
There he is.

741
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.000 line:83%
He's the man who accused me
of inserting my sperm...

742
00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.000 line:83%
...into his wife
with the help of your staff.

743
00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.280 line:83%
It's just a misunderstanding.
I was just kidding.

744
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.800 line:83%
I was friends with him in college.
With my wife too.

745
00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.560 line:83%
We met again as your patients.

746
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.880 line:83%
You didn't sound like you were joking
when you called me.

747
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.080 line:83%
I think you need to go out more often.

748
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.440 line:83%
Are you at all familiar
with the term pranking?

749
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.680 line:83%
I know what pranking means.

750
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.680 line:83%
There you go! I was pranking you.

751
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.960 line:83%
But I forgot that you sometimes
take everything too seriously.

752
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.200 line:83%
- What's going on?
- He called me yesterday.

753
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.480 line:83%
He accused me of conspiring with the clinic
to fertilize your eggs with my sperms.

754
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.040 line:83%
Is that true?

755
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:47.080 line:83%
Once again, it was just a prank.
But he thought it was real.

756
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.720 line:83%
Where did you get this prank idea?

757
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.400 line:83%
You are allowed to be creative
when you're pranking someone.

758
00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.760 line:83%
Well...

759
00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.800 line:83%
I'm sorry. Please don't take it to heart.

760
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.720 line:83%
All right.

761
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.080 line:83%
But you owe Nadya an explanation.

762
00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.480 line:83%
Let's just end this topic, okay?
Why so serious?

763
00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.200 line:83%
Because it is.

764
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.000 line:83%
For your information...

765
00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.200 line:83%
...my husband and I were here
to get the IVF treatment too...

766
00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.720 line:83%
...but it didn't work.

767
00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:28.720 line:83%
There's no problem with my husband.
But instead, the problem is with me.

768
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.480 line:83%
People say it's called being barren.

769
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.600 line:83%
Assalamualaikum!

770
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.200 line:83%
Waalaikumsalam...

771
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.560 line:83%
I'm Andien's father.

772
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.480 line:83%
She has recovered now,
but the hospital still won't discharge her.

773
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.800 line:83%
They said there are things
which need to be cleared with her billing.

774
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:55.440 line:83%
And the person who caused the accident
gave her a cheque.

775
00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.480 line:83%
But the bank said,
he gave her a blank cheque.

776
00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.000 line:83%
And now I'm confused!

777
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.000 line:83%
That's impossible.
The money is in the account.

778
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.120 line:83%
What?

779
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.720 line:83%
Oh!

780
00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.480 line:83%
So you're the asshole
who gave Andien a blank cheque!

781
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.600 line:83%
How dare you.

782
00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.960 line:83%
You should be happy
I don't know where you live.

783
00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.720 line:83%
Otherwise, I'd go there to beat you up
and cut you into little pieces.

784
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.440 line:83%
How dare he treat us
little people like that!

785
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.040 line:83%
If you have hurt her,
you should take responsibility.

786
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.320 line:83%
- Are you crazy?
- I can explain, Sir.

787
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.280 line:83%
Why do you need to give him an explanation?
Are you...

788
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.160 line:83%
I took Andien to the hospital.

789
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.800 line:83%
Why did you take her to the hospital?

790
00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.040 line:83%
Madam and Sir.

791
00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.560 line:83%
Madam and Sir.

792
00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.040 line:83%
This is not the right place
to have a serious discussion.

793
00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:55.000 line:83%
Why don't we find a quiet room
where the WiFi signal is strong...

794
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.720 line:83%
...and we can sit and relax?

795
00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.240 line:83%
- Togar.
- Yes, Sir.

796
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.920 line:83%
- Ipin!
- Yes, Sir.

797
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.680 line:83%
Both of you. Wait outside.

798
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.320 line:83%
Yes, Sir.

799
00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:28.960 line:83%
Now that we're all seated and calm.

800
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.360 line:83%
We can start...

801
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.720 line:83%
Excuse me.

802
00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.960 line:83%
Hello, Andien.

803
00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.000 line:83%
- Hello?
- Yes?

804
00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.960 line:83%
Is my father at the clinic?

805
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.640 line:83%
Why are you asking?

806
00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.000 line:83%
Because he told me
he's going to the clinic...

807
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.120 line:83%
...to ask Mr. Alan to pay for my hospital bill.

808
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.200 line:83%
But...

809
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.600 line:83%
Wait a minute.

810
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.200 line:83%
Why do you want Mr. Alan
to pay your hospital bill?

811
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.120 line:83%
Why do you think he has to pay?

812
00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:02.080 line:83%
Because he was the reason I fell
and lost consciousness.

813
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.360 line:83%
What?

814
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.360 line:83%
Where did that happen?

815
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:11.480 line:83%
It's a long story.
I'll tell you after I return to work.

816
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.040 line:83%
Stop confusing us.

817
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.680 line:83%
Hold on, they can hear us talking.

818
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.200 line:83%
Don't hang up.

819
00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.840 line:83%
Tell me everything.

820
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.320 line:83%
Mr. Alan asked to see me.

821
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.840 line:83%
He said he wanted to celebrate
his wife's pregnancy.

822
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:32.040 line:83%
But actually he was just curious
about his wife's pregnancy.

823
00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:37.360 line:83%
There's nothing magical about it
because they're on IVF treatment.

824
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:41.600 line:83%
That's right, but...

825
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.000 line:83%
But what?

826
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:48.760 line:83%
I think he already knew
that he's sterile.

827
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.720 line:83%
That's why he asked me
to fake his lab result.

828
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.080 line:83%
He wanted you to think
there's no problem with his sperm count.

829
00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.960 line:83%
Enough, Andien!

830
00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.000 line:83%
Hey, where are you going?

831
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.280 line:83%
Did you do what he asked?

832
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.160 line:83%
I needed the money to settle my debts.

833
00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.640 line:83%
That's your own responsibility.
This situation is so messed up.

834
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.480 line:83%
Then you suggested them
to do an IVF treatment.

835
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.880 line:83%
Of course Mr. Alan went on panic mode,
because he had to give you...

836
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.600 line:83%
...his sperm sample once again.

837
00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:23.040 line:83%
And this time he wouldn't be able to fake the result.

838
00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:25.120 line:83%
But the treatment worked.

839
00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.080 line:83%
It did.

840
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.760 line:83%
But actually...

841
00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.520 line:83%
Actually what? Andien?

842
00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.680 line:83%
- Please lower your voice, doctor.
- It's okay.

843
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.280 line:83%
Late at night, I entered the lab.

844
00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.440 line:83%
Then I checked the sperm samples we had...

845
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.960 line:83%
...and I picked the best one.

846
00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.480 line:83%
Andien, tell me the truth.

847
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.960 line:83%
Whose sperm did you choose?

848
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.880 line:83%
Another patient.

849
00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.840 line:83%
His name is Athar.

850
00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:04.040 line:83%
So you put
Mr. Athar's sperm samples with Mrs. Nadya’s eggs?

851
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.080 line:83%
Correct.

852
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.680 line:83%
So Mrs. Nadya is actually pregnant
with Mr. Athar's sperms.

853
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.720 line:83%
I'm going to report you to the police, Andien!

854
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.440 line:83%
Hey!

855
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.840 line:83%
Watch what you're saying.

856
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.440 line:83%
If you report her to the police,
I'm going to be very mad.

857
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.840 line:83%
Hello?

858
00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.360 line:83%
Where are you going?

859
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.880 line:83%
I don't want to live
under the same roof with you.

860
01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.840 line:83%
No.

861
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.320 line:83%
Please don't go.

862
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.320 line:83%
You're pregnant.

863
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.760 line:83%
If you don't want to live under
the same roof with me...

864
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.400 line:83%
...then I'll go.

865
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.960 line:83%
Don't try to come here after this
without my consent.

866
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.920 line:83%
- Good evening, Sir.
- Good evening. I'd like to check-in.

867
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.160 line:83%
- Have you made a reservation?
- Not yet.

868
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.480 line:83%
How long are you going to stay?

869
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.280 line:83%
One week, I think?

870
01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.560 line:83%
Can you fill out this form first, Sir?
You can use this pen.

871
01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.880 line:83%
- Hello!
- Hi, mother.

872
01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.400 line:83%
Hi, my pregnant daughter-in-law!

873
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.000 line:83%
You look so pale.

874
01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.040 line:83%
Sit down.

875
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.600 line:83%
Slowly.

876
01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.760 line:83%
Oh, dear.

877
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.120 line:83%
- Are you feeling well?
- I'm okay, mother.

878
01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.000 line:83%
I'm sorry.

879
01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.720 line:83%
Why do you need to apologize to me?

880
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.160 line:83%
All this time...

881
01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.680 line:83%
...I thought you were infertile.

882
01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.360 line:83%
Barren.

883
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.240 line:83%
But it turned out the treatment worked.

884
01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:45.000 line:83%
It did work, but it was not easy.

885
01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.880 line:83%
I was a bad person
to think you were infertile.

886
01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.880 line:83%
I've never thought of you as a bad person.

887
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.520 line:83%
Take care of yourself.

888
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.800 line:83%
Don't lift anything heavy.

889
01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.440 line:83%
Don't go up and down the stairs.

890
01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.640 line:83%
My room is on the second floor.
I have to go up and down the stairs.

891
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.400 line:83%
I will tell Alan to make a new room
on the ground floor!

892
01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.160 line:83%
Where is he? Alan!

893
01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.000 line:83%
He's not home, mother.

894
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.200 line:83%
Where is he? At the office?

895
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.000 line:83%
What is he doing there?

896
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.840 line:83%
He should work from home
and let his managers and staff...

897
01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.360 line:83%
...work more to deserve their salaries.

898
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.480 line:83%
I don't mind.

899
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.920 line:83%
I don't want him to get tired of me
being around him all the time...

900
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.360 line:83%
...when he's working from home.

901
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.600 line:83%
If he ever gets tired to see
such a lovely wife as you...

902
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.720 line:83%
...then he's a fool!

903
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.680 line:83%
Better be a fool than sorry.

904
01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360 line:83%
Hello.

905
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.000 line:83%
Finally, you answered the phone.

906
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.680 line:83%
Are you busy?

907
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.080 line:83%
What do you want?

908
01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.000 line:83%
I want to apologize.

909
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.600 line:83%
What you did to us cannot be forgiven.

910
01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.680 line:83%
I never told you
to switch the sperm samples.

911
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.120 line:83%
I know, Sir.

912
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.240 line:83%
I was fired.

913
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.400 line:83%
Please don't report me to the police.

914
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.360 line:83%
My wife and I agreed
not to report you to the police...

915
01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.960 line:83%
...because we think it will harm
the twins' mental health when they grow up.

916
01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.560 line:83%
Don't ever try to contact me again.

917
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.640 line:83%
Honey.

918
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.440 line:83%
I think there's a silver lining
with everything that has happened.

919
01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.280 line:83%
God is showing us the way.

920
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.280 line:83%
There's something great in it for you.

921
01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.160 line:83%
I don't see any silver lining
Or anything great in it for me.

922
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.840 line:83%
What are you talking about?

923
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.000 line:83%
Honey.

924
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.720 line:83%
You can have a child...

925
01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.760 line:83%
...without marrying another woman.

926
01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.520 line:83%
Let's go to sleep.

927
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.320 line:83%
It's late, and I can't even tell
if I'm awake or dreaming.

928
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.480 line:83%
You're talking nonsense. I need to sleep.

929
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.000 line:83%
The twins are growing up so well.

930
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.920 line:83%
Can you see their heads here?

931
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.400 line:83%
They're so healthy and ready
to go to junior high.

932
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.000 line:83%
Mrs. Nadia, Mrs. Karin's here.

933
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.280 line:83%
How are you, Karin?

934
01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.920 line:83%
Good. I hope you are too.

935
01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.240 line:83%
You have an appointment with the doctor too?

936
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.440 line:83%
No.

937
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.400 line:83%
I've come here to see you.

938
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:52.200 line:83%
Is it okay if we sit down
and talk for a minute?

939
01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.400 line:83%
Sure, more than a minute is okay too.

940
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.200 line:83%
Do you miss her?

941
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.760 line:83%
Not her.

942
01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.080 line:83%
Just the babies inside her.

943
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.680 line:83%
How about we pay her a visit?

944
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.320 line:83%
To her house?

945
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.240 line:83%
I understand if you don't want to go.

946
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.840 line:83%
I can go there alone.

947
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.000 line:83%
What are you going to do there?

948
01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.720 line:83%
I feel sorry for her.

949
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.880 line:83%
I know you've been communicating
with each other.

950
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.880 line:83%
We have been.

951
01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.400 line:83%
- How about you?
- No.

952
01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.920 line:83%
Then you don't know that
they don't live together anymore?

953
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.800 line:83%
Do you mean they got divorced?

954
01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.800 line:83%
Well, well, well.

955
01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.920 line:83%
Now I got your attention.

956
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.720 line:83%
Are you happy
they don't live together anymore?

957
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.600 line:83%
I know deep down you still want her.

958
01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.200 line:83%
Are you jealous?

959
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.880 line:83%
No, I feel fine.

960
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.880 line:83%
And I'm okay if you still want her.
Now you can get a complete package.

961
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.240 line:83%
You can get the mother and the children too.

962
01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.800 line:83%
- Really? Are you sure?
- Don't be silly.

963
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.200 line:83%
You're perfect for me.

964
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.560 line:83%
Cute.

965
01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.160 line:83%
- Ma'am, you have guests.
- Who?

966
01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.360 line:83%
Morning, Nad. How are you?

967
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.120 line:83%
I'm fine, and I'm happy to see you here.

968
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.680 line:83%
Thank you for bringing Karin here, Athar.

969
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.760 line:83%
Actually, she dragged me here.

970
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.320 line:83%
So you didn't want to come?

971
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.440 line:83%
I mean...

972
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.320 line:83%
I caught you staring at Nadya's picture.

973
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.080 line:83%
So I thought why not go to see her in person?

974
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.600 line:83%
Don't be silly.

975
01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.280 line:83%
There's nothing we can do.

976
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.240 line:83%
No amount of additional investment will help.

977
01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.400 line:83%
If we keep pushing the production
with such low margins...

978
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.440 line:83%
...It's going to bleed us dry.

979
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.840 line:83%
Get everything done, go back to Jakarta,
and take care of the Sentul project, okay?

980
01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.000 line:83%
It's been a tough year.

981
01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.680 line:83%
Maybe the people in that office have
committed so many sins.

982
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.200 line:83%
I have my share of sins too.

983
01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.480 line:83%
Daddy!

984
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.000 line:83%
Did you have fun?

985
01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.240 line:83%
- This is my wife.
- Hello.

986
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.320 line:83%
Say hello to Mr. Alan.

987
01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.560 line:83%
I'm going to leave you both here for a while.

988
01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.120 line:83%
- Mommy needs to go for a while.
- Yes, Mom.

989
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.600 line:83%
Excuse me, Mr. Alan.

990
01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.880 line:83%
I can make this sound.

991
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.160 line:83%
You're funny.

992
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.640 line:83%
- How old are you?
- I'm seven.

993
01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.920 line:83%
- Can I play with that trolley?
- Sure, go ahead.

994
01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.320 line:83%
Do you think he resembles you or your wife?

995
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.120 line:83%
None of us.

996
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.760 line:83%
Because we adopted him when he was a baby.

997
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.800 line:83%
I felt so bad for my wife
because she desperately wanted children...

998
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.240 line:83%
...but I couldn't give her children.

999
01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.200 line:83%
However, she agreed to adopt.

1000
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.400 line:83%
You couldn't give her children?

1001
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.280 line:83%
The medical term for that is infertile.

1002
01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.960 line:83%
And I'm infertile.

1003
01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.360 line:83%
I can't believe you're telling me.
About your weakness so openly.

1004
01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.520 line:83%
It doesn't matter.

1005
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.240 line:83%
I know that I love my boy
and I know he loves me too.

1006
01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.840 line:83%
So many fathers today don't spend enough time
with their children.

1007
01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.840 line:83%
But I can proudly tell you
that I'm not one of them.

1008
01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.800 line:83%
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

1009
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.160 line:83%
Mr. Alan.

1010
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.520 line:83%
- She's not home?
- Yes, Sir. She actually just left.

1011
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.760 line:83%
Where have you been?

1012
01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.360 line:83%
My wife still doesn't want to see me.

1013
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.080 line:83%
I forgot.

1014
01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.800 line:83%
How is she?

1015
01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.880 line:83%
Will never change, Sir.

1016
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.960 line:83%
Explain that.

1017
01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.720 line:83%
She's still as beautiful as before.

1018
01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.040 line:83%
Has she even mentioned me?

1019
01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.320 line:83%
No, Sir.

1020
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.960 line:83%
Are you sure? Not even once?

1021
01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.000 line:83%
No, Sir.

1022
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.200 line:83%
Does she look sad?

1023
01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.280 line:83%
She looks fine.

1024
01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.000 line:83%
Oh...

1025
01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.600 line:83%
So that means she's okay without me.

1026
01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.240 line:83%
That's what she shows me.

1027
01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.160 line:83%
But nobody really knows what she is going through?

1028
01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.920 line:83%
Trying to be smart with me?

1029
01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:07.840 line:83%
Karti.

1030
01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.360 line:83%
Yes, Ma'am?

1031
01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.080 line:83%
- Who brought the flowers?
- Mr. Alan.

1032
01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.720 line:83%
Did he ask you where I was before he came?

1033
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.800 line:83%
Yes, Ma'am.

1034
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.160 line:83%
He came here with the bouquet
and then he left.

1035
01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.120 line:83%
Don't say he left, instead say he went home.
To wherever his home is now.

1036
01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.440 line:83%
If you say he left,
then you assume he's still living here.

1037
01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.800 line:83%
Yes, Ma'am. He left.
I mean, he went back home.

1038
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.320 line:83%
Put it in the trash.

1039
01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.800 line:83%
- She's not home, is she?
- Yes, Sir.

1040
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.000 line:83%
The babies are healthy.
They're growing fast and active.

1041
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.920 line:83%
Mother.

1042
01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.000 line:83%
Mother.

1043
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.320 line:83%
- Okay?
- Yes. Thanks.

1044
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.800 line:83%
Thanks.

1045
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.720 line:83%
Hello.

1046
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.320 line:83%
Alan.

1047
01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.640 line:83%
Hey, Athar.

1048
01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.720 line:83%
How are you doing bro?
I haven't seen you for a long time.

1049
01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.920 line:83%
I'm still around.

1050
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.880 line:83%
Anyways...

1051
01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.880 line:83%
...I want to apologize to you...

1052
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.160 line:83%
...for hurting your feelings.

1053
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.480 line:83%
And for causing you so much trouble.

1054
01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.200 line:83%
What you did was wrong
when you manipulated the data.

1055
01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.960 line:83%
But you didn't switch the sperm samples.
Andien did that.

1056
01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.560 line:83%
I still need to apologize to you and Karin.

1057
01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.200 line:83%
But have you apologized to your wife?

1058
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.520 line:83%
She doesn't want to see me.

1059
01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:38.600 line:83%
Oh...

1060
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.360 line:83%
By the way, how's your mother?
Is she getting better?

1061
01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.040 line:83%
My mother? What are you talking about?

1062
01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.000 line:83%
You don't know she's in the hospital?

1063
01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.240 line:83%
What?

1064
01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.880 line:83%
Let's go. I know where her room is.

1065
01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.320 line:83%
Mom!

1066
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.560 line:83%
Who are you?

1067
01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.080 line:83%
I'm Alan.

1068
01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.640 line:83%
Alan? Alan who?

1069
01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.160 line:83%
It's Alan, your son.

1070
01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.920 line:83%
My son?

1071
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.800 line:83%
Which son?

1072
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.840 line:83%
Mom.

1073
01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.920 line:83%
Please forgive me.

1074
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.520 line:83%
Hey, hey.

1075
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.920 line:83%
You entered the wrong room.

1076
01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.600 line:83%
I really don't know who you are.

1077
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.200 line:83%
What's wrong with my mother?

1078
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.520 line:83%
The doctor said she had a heart attack.

1079
01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.600 line:83%
Then why does she have dementia?

1080
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.880 line:83%
What's your name again?

1081
01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:07.240 line:83%
It's Alan, Mom. Alan Suryadiningrat.

1082
01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:14.040 line:83%
Sorry, but I really don't know who you are.

1083
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.240 line:83%
Mom...

1084
01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.640 line:83%
I'm joking.

1085
01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.960 line:83%
Do you think you're the only one
who can lie to the world?

1086
01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.440 line:83%
You're a fool!

1087
01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.400 line:83%
Prank!

1088
01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:48.240 line:83%
This was the only way
I could get both of you in the same room.

1089
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.000 line:83%
Alan doesn't know I tricked him.

1090
01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.720 line:83%
So, here he is.

1091
01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.200 line:83%
Move.

1092
01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:03.320 line:83%
So you're not ill at all?

1093
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:08.160 line:83%
Thank goodness! Mother!

1094
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.600 line:83%
Nadya.

1095
01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.560 line:83%
What happened?

1096
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.240 line:83%
Doctor!

1097
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.800 line:83%
Is Mrs. Nadya's husband here?

1098
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.320 line:83%
Congratulations,
your twin boys are born healthy.

1099
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.400 line:83%
- All is done.
- Thank you.

1100
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.760 line:83%
I know what I did to you was wrong.

1101
01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.760 line:83%
I was so selfish.

1102
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.720 line:83%
I sacrificed your feelings in the process.

1103
01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.600 line:83%
I was too afraid to look weak.

1104
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.680 line:83%
I wasn't ready to admit that I have flaws.

1105
01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:14.720 line:83%
I was ashamed of looking like a failure to you.

1106
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.800 line:83%
I got carried away with the lies
I had been telling you.

1107
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.560 line:83%
To feed my illusion of perfection.

1108
01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.400 line:83%
I love you.

1109
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.200 line:83%
Please forgive me.

1110
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.360 line:83%
The stigma of men who can't have children
is so wrong.

1111
01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.000 line:83%
- It only adds...
- Alan.

1112
01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.920 line:83%
You don't need to tell me.

1113
01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.800 line:83%
I know who you are.

1114
01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:09.880 line:83%
You don't need to explain
something that I already knew.

1115
01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.120 line:83%
But at least...

1116
01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.560 line:83%
...can you forgive me?

1117
01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.120 line:83%
You can change your act or your look...

1118
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.240 line:83%
...but you're still the same to me.

1119
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.200 line:83%
I still see you as the man...

1120
01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:42.480 line:83%
...who made me fall in love with you
eight years ago with just one look.

1121
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.280 line:83%
So...

1122
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.840 line:83%
...you forgive me?

1123
01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.880 line:83%
Of course I forgive you.

1124
01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.640 line:83%
I promise I will protect our children
and love our children.

1125
01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:26.440 line:83%
Our children?

1126
01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.560 line:83%
Yes.

1127
01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.520 line:83%
Our children.

1128
01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.200 line:83%
Have you farted yet?

1129
01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:47.320 line:83%
Congrats, mother. Here are your babies.

1130
01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.600 line:83%
My babies.

1131
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.360 line:83%
Here you go.

1132
01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.000 line:83%
Congrats, Nadya.

1133
01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.120 line:83%
Thank you.

1134
01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.520 line:83%
- Honey, come closer.
- Yes?

1135
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.000 line:83%
Do you agree if one of the boys...

1136
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.000 line:83%
Five Years Later

1137
01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.440 line:83%
...there were flowers
and bright lights in the dark.

1138
01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.400 line:83%
I'm so happy to see you sharing toys,
Rama and Romi.

1139
01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.800 line:83%
Then the horses are decorated
with cool stuff.

1140
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.360 line:83%
Package!

1141
01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.360 line:83%
Don't forget to tip the courier.

1142
01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.360 line:83%
Why did he drop the package by the gate?

1143
01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.720 line:83%
Hey, hey!

1144
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.200 line:83%
This is a disaster!

1145
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.640 line:83%
Miss, why were you speeding
in a gated community?

1146
01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.160 line:83%
Hey!

1147
01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.080 line:83%
My noodles!

1148
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.720 line:83%
Wait, wait!

1149
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.000 line:83%
My noodles! You have to pay for the damage!

1150
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.080 line:83%
What happened?

1151
01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.800 line:83%
The driver said she just saw a ghost.

1152
01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.960 line:83%
But the sun is still shining.
Are you sure the driver saw a ghost?

1153
01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.680 line:83%
Your Mom and Dad are here
to pick you up, Romi.

1154
01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.600 line:83%
Do I have to go?

1155
01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.600 line:83%
You both have been playing together since morning.

1156
01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.200 line:83%
What did you say?

1157
01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.680 line:83%
You have an Instagram account?

1158
01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:21.360 line:83%
Let me help you. We're going home after this.

1159
01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:26.160 line:83%
You know what, I just saw
someone hit a noodle's cart and run.

1160
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.200 line:83%
- I think the driver was the person who left from here.
- I think it's the courier delivery person.

1161
01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.760 line:83%
We just got a package
from a friend delivered to us.

1162
01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.000 line:83%
But when Alan approached the courier
to give a tip, the courier ran away.

1163
01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.400 line:83%
Then it's the same person.

1164
01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.440 line:83%
Maybe the courier is one of your exes.

1165
01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.360 line:83%
Were you a playboy, Dad?

1166
01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.560 line:83%
I didn't say that.

1167
01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.440 line:83%
I didn't say that either.
