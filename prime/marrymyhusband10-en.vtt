00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:38.748 line:80%
Ji-won, that little...

2
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.375 line:80%
Kang Ji-won!

3
00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:43.043 line:80%
Damn it!

4
00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:45.379 line:80%
Why was that for? It hurts!

5
00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:48.257 line:80%
It's your fault.
Why are you throwing a tantrum?

6
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.718 line:80%
-Stop acting like a child.
-What did I do?

7
00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.428 line:80%
Are you serious right now?

8
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:55.973 line:80%
How could you bring such an impudent brat?

9
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.518 line:80%
She's normally nice!

10
00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:02.563 line:80%
She must have been possessed. Whatever!

11
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.106 line:80%
Goodness...

12
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.526 line:80%
You just got hit by a woman.
You still run your mouth.

13
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.528 line:80%
You see one, you've seen it all.

14
00:01:09.612 --> 00:01:13.365 line:80%
I told you home discipline was important
countless times!

15
00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:16.202 line:80%
This happened
because you didn't listen to me.

16
00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:18.746 line:80%
What will you do about this?

17
00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.831 line:80%
-God...
-What will you do?

18
00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:21.999 line:80%
Stop it!

19
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.212 line:80%
Darn it. She doesn't know anything.

20
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:29.340 line:80%
Ji-won went crazy.
What does she expect me to do?

21
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.345 line:80%
Ji-won, you're dead.

22
00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:37.807 line:80%
Ji-won, come out!

23
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.601 line:80%
Did you think I'd just let it go?

24
00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:44.730 line:80%
I've been too easy on you!
Know your place! Stop messing around!

25
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.233 line:80%
I know you're inside.

26
00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:49.568 line:80%
Come out! Now!

27
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.572 line:80%
Hello...

28
00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:56.867 line:80%
Ms. Kang, what are you wearing?

29
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:58.035 line:80%
Was I bad?

30
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.663 line:80%
Are you punishing me?
Like in a naughty way.

31
00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:02.248 line:80%
No, it's not that...

32
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.711 line:80%
I had something to refund today, so...

33
00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:09.338 line:80%
Then the outfit's perfect.

34
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.006 line:80%
-Was it a success?
-Yes.

35
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.638 line:80%
This is his first time to a housewarming.

36
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.141 line:80%
So I told him to buy
tissues and detergent as gifts.

37
00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:24.687 line:80%
I don't know about those flowers, though.

38
00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:27.606 line:80%
I love flowers.

39
00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:39.827 line:80%
What... What the hell?

40
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.038 line:80%
What uncultured fool yells like this?

41
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.585 line:80%
Wait a second...

42
00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.170 line:80%
This is the right number.

43
00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:52.631 line:80%
-Ji-won's brother?
-What are you saying?

44
00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:55.092 line:80%
Yes, hello, sir.

45
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.802 line:80%
You were working out.

46
00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.805 line:80%
This is where my girlfriend lives.

47
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:02.683 line:80%
I think I was mistaken.

48
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:03.851 line:80%
Girlfriend?

49
00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.146 line:80%
The last tenant was a woman.

50
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.230 line:80%
Wait...

51
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.733 line:80%
The last tenant?

52
00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.194 line:80%
It's the perfect size for newlyweds.

53
00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:16.322 line:80%
But why rent?

54
00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:19.450 line:80%
Mr. Park went on about
how a man should own a house.

55
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.747 line:80%
I hear you pay the rent to my brother.

56
00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:27.291 line:80%
Don't pay it.

57
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.919 line:80%
He won't know.
He doesn't check his account.

58
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:31.670 line:80%
This place was for me anyway.

59
00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:34.673 line:80%
That's different.

60
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.303 line:80%
Why here of all places, though?

61
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.973 line:80%
Your boss lives in the building.
It'll be so uncomfortable.

62
00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.059 line:80%
This to the bedroom?

63
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.393 line:80%
Yes. Thanks.

64
00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:14.046 line:80%
Take it easy, okay?

65
00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.256 line:80%
-Bye!
-Get home safely.

66
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.050 line:80%
Bye, Hui-yeon!

67
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.101 line:80%
Bye.

68
00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:44.284 line:80%
Even though you were born into a life
where you can't live your own way,

69
00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:47.037 line:80%
I didn't think
a business marriage was right.

70
00:04:48.414 --> 00:04:52.209 line:80%
So when you called the wedding off
with Yu-ra, I was glad.

71
00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:56.964 line:80%
Is there another reason?

72
00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:04.555 line:80%
I mean, Ji-hyuk, by any chance,

73
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.765 line:80%
if you have feelings for someone

74
00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.726 line:80%
who's very important to me...

75
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.227 line:80%
What are you worried about?

76
00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.730 line:80%
I might do something with Ji-won?

77
00:05:13.272 --> 00:05:14.273 line:80%
Well...

78
00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:17.693 line:80%
Do what? She's getting married.

79
00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:19.987 line:80%
There. Now, go home.

80
00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.114 line:80%
Ji-hyuk...

81
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:30.539 line:80%
Nothing's going on,
and I won't do anything.

82
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.042 line:80%
She's a good person, so I want to help.

83
00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:36.920 line:80%
Also, I'm grateful that she's nice to you.
Happy now?

84
00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:40.799 line:80%
Go home.

85
00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:49.183 line:80%
But I've never seen him like that.

86
00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:04.531 line:80%
Damn it...

87
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.785 line:80%
Mr. Park.

88
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:08.952 line:80%
What's wrong?

89
00:06:09.912 --> 00:06:12.664 line:80%
-Did you have a good weekend?
-Yeah.

90
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:13.874 line:80%
You look great.

91
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.258 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won. You...

92
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.013 line:80%
Are you insane?

93
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.224 line:80%
-What's going on?
-Oh, no.

94
00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.392 line:80%
Why are you hitting me?

95
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.019 line:80%
Why you...

96
00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.149 line:80%
That's enough.

97
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:41.318 line:80%
You did nothing when she hit me.

98
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.362 line:80%
Why are you so unfair?

99
00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:48.408 line:80%
Did you share your love with two women
because you like being fair?

100
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.666 line:80%
Ms. Kang, let's go.

101
00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:57.376 line:80%
Just a minute.

102
00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.336 line:80%
I should confront the cheater.

103
00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.845 line:80%
-What?
-Panties?

104
00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:13.350 line:80%
Whose is this?

105
00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:15.936 line:80%
I found it in your car.

106
00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.574 line:80%
How could you go through my car?

107
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:39.877 line:80%
How dare you shout? You cheater!

108
00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.463 line:80%
Did you hear about Park Min-hwan?

109
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.632 line:80%
-He cheated on Kang Ji-won.
-Really?

110
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.258 line:80%
You know Park Min-hwan, right?

111
00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:29.384 line:80%
From marketing!

112
00:08:29.468 --> 00:08:31.094 line:80%
-He cheated.
-What?

113
00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.347 line:80%
And they did it in a car...

114
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.431 line:80%
What?

115
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.683 line:80%
A car? They did it in a car?

116
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.810 line:80%
Big news!

117
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:42.606 line:80%
I can't believe it.

118
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.942 line:80%
Rumors spread to HR?

119
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.693 line:80%
That's huge news.

120
00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:48.946 line:80%
I swear...

121
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.447 line:80%
What will they do?

122
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.950 line:80%
"Man cheats in seven-year relationship."

123
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.368 line:80%
"Panties were thrown."

124
00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:58.205 line:80%
When Mr. Park tried to hit her,

125
00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.082 line:80%
-Mr. Yu stopped him.
-Red panties.

126
00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.376 line:80%
Everyone, U&K's icon...

127
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.670 line:80%
has returned.

128
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.213 line:80%
It was red.

129
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.215 line:80%
It's like a soap opera.

130
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.053 line:80%
I don't watch TV. I get my fix here.

131
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:19.559 line:80%
So that's why she did that to my mom.

132
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:22.729 line:80%
What do I do?

133
00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.440 line:80%
Girls like her are scary.

134
00:09:28.944 --> 00:09:31.113 line:80%
You can't manage your panties?

135
00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.281 line:80%
They're not mine.

136
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.741 line:80%
What?

137
00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:36.243 line:80%
Those aren't yours?

138
00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:41.248 line:80%
But I did it only with you in my car.

139
00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.545 line:80%
If they're not yours, why were they there?

140
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.714 line:80%
What the hell is going on?

141
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.549 line:80%
What happened?

142
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:51.758 line:80%
Whose are they?

143
00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:53.302 line:80%
What are you saying?

144
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.178 line:80%
Damn it!

145
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.018 line:80%
I knew he'd take the bait.

146
00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.229 line:80%
They don't belong to Su-min,

147
00:10:04.313 --> 00:10:06.732 line:80%
but I chose panties you'd love.

148
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.861 line:80%
Are you okay?

149
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.196 line:80%
I'm so sorry.

150
00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:18.577 line:80%
Just a moment.

151
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.123 line:80%
Hey, Eun-ho.

152
00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:27.461 line:80%
I'm at work right now.

153
00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.837 line:80%
I'll call you later.

154
00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:30.881 line:80%
Okay.

155
00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:38.180 line:80%
We had the family meeting
at Eun-ho's restaurant.

156
00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:41.308 line:80%
He saw me upset and was worried.

157
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:42.684 line:80%
Yesterday?

158
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.438 line:80%
So you went knowing everything?

159
00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:51.651 line:80%
Is that why you dressed that way?

160
00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.365 line:80%
You should've told us.

161
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.909 line:80%
I bet you were so upset.

162
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.623 line:80%
Anyway, do you know who she is?

163
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.631 line:80%
This makes no sense.

164
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:15.926 line:80%
Ji-won didn't get in my car.
How did she find them?

165
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.928 line:80%
I have to ask.

166
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:24.184 line:80%
Ask where she found it?
That won't change that you cheated.

167
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.812 line:80%
Hey! What the hell?

168
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.231 line:80%
Stop screaming!

169
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.234 line:80%
You just fell in love.

170
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.778 line:80%
It's not right, but it happens.

171
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.113 line:80%
People change.

172
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.952 line:80%
And she should've acted right
to prevent it.

173
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.497 line:80%
That's just great.

174
00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.176 line:80%
Look who it is.

175
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.721 line:80%
The great Ji-won
who does all the company's work herself.

176
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.473 line:80%
Mr. Kim!

177
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:05.142 line:80%
Mr. Kim!

178
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.269 line:80%
-You'll get in trouble.
-That little...

179
00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.063 line:80%
Look at how she acts!

180
00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:12.899 line:80%
-That's why men cheat on her!
-Stop it.

181
00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:16.153 line:80%
I can't believe her. Goodness.

182
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.698 line:80%
For men, it's important what kind
of women they meet.

183
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:22.159 line:80%
They can meet a fox, but not a bear.

184
00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.537 line:80%
-That's men.
-That's right.

185
00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:29.875 line:80%
Yeah.

186
00:12:30.876 --> 00:12:32.252 line:80%
It's been a while.

187
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:37.674 line:80%
Many people get married
and divorced these days.

188
00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.593 line:80%
You just followed your heart.

189
00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:42.721 line:80%
So don't worry about it.

190
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.139 line:80%
We must not waver.

191
00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.733 line:80%
It seems you're mistaken right now.

192
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:56.735 line:80%
Jeong Su-min.

193
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.113 line:80%
You're not marriage material.

194
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.118 line:80%
Kang Ji-won graduated
from Hankuk University.

195
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.706 line:80%
She saved quite a lot of money
and is very self-sufficient.

196
00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:11.291 line:80%
What about you?

197
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.546 line:80%
What else do you have

198
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.298 line:80%
besides being pretty?

199
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.427 line:80%
What do you have?

200
00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.432 line:80%
That we slept together?
Sure, it was great.

201
00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:30.519 line:80%
But let's be realistic.
I'm not in my twenties.

202
00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:31.645 line:80%
Marry you?

203
00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.357 line:80%
Know your place.

204
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:38.652 line:80%
What?

205
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:40.737 line:80%
What?

206
00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:42.656 line:80%
Hey!

207
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.325 line:80%
You...

208
00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.411 line:80%
You bastard!

209
00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:49.704 line:80%
What?

210
00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.081 line:80%
-Hey!
-What?

211
00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.334 line:80%
Mr. Kim.

212
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.669 line:80%
Mr. Kim, wait...

213
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.047 line:80%
How could you do that to Su-min?

214
00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.091 line:80%
How could you?

215
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:05.011 line:80%
How could you? Let go!
How could you do that to Su-min?

216
00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:06.846 line:80%
How could you do that?

217
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.223 line:80%
Mr. Kim, come here.

218
00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.268 line:80%
What's wrong? Stop it.

219
00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.520 line:80%
Su-min...

220
00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:15.772 line:80%
Let go of me!

221
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.190 line:80%
How could you do that?

222
00:14:17.274 --> 00:14:18.733 line:80%
Mr. Kim!

223
00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:23.238 line:80%
So the woman Mr. Park cheated with
is Jeong Su-min, right?

224
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:24.906 line:80%
Kang Ji-won's best friend?

225
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.034 line:80%
Wow, it's like a jungle.

226
00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:30.078 line:80%
What's happening at work?

227
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.204 line:80%
What? Why?

228
00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:36.042 line:80%
-Big news!
-Gather around!

229
00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:37.502 line:80%
What is it?

230
00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:38.920 line:80%
Park Min-hwan...

231
00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:41.006 line:80%
-And Jeong Su-min?
-You knew?

232
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.382 line:80%
-You knew?
-Yeah!

233
00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.678 line:80%
And they've been
best friends since middle school!

234
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.221 line:80%
Isn't that crazy?

235
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.017 line:80%
Poor Ji-won!

236
00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:57.188 line:80%
THE CHEATING LEGEND

237
00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:59.608 line:80%
-Tell me about it.
-Panties Park!

238
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.109 line:80%
Panties Park?

239
00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.652 line:80%
I want to quit!

240
00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.280 line:80%
CHEATED WITH HER BEST FRIEND

241
00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:08.283 line:80%

OTHER HALF

244
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.769 line:80%
Ji-won, did you move?

245
00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.604 line:80%
I think we should talk.

246
00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.397 line:80%
I'm in front of your place.

247
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.608 line:80%
You don't believe others, do you?

248
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.109 line:80%
You have to believe me.

249
00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:52.661 line:80%
LEE WOO FOOD MEAL KIT TASTING

250
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:56.665 line:80%
It's the data
from last weekend's tasting event.

251
00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:58.166 line:80%
And I have concerns.

252
00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.293 line:80%
Can you take a look?

253
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.215 line:80%
Lee Woo Food had a meal kit event?

254
00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:08.718 line:80%
Then shouldn't we have run a booth too?

255
00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.932 line:80%
By the way, where's our product?

256
00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.016 line:80%
I don't see it.

257
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:17.686 line:80%
If you take a look,

258
00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:21.648 line:80%
it's in the back like this.

259
00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:27.696 line:80%
The tasting event went well,
so I thought it'd be displayed up front.

Oh, my God!

265
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.476 line:80%
How could you do this?

266
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.312 line:80%
Even if there was an incident,
why cover it?

267
00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.109 line:80%
Pardon? What...

268
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.529 line:80%
Jomart. I heard about
the allergen sign issue.

269
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.781 line:80%
Why didn't you report it?

270
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.325 line:80%
How did you know?

271
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.416 line:80%
Instead of apologizing to Jomart,
you yelled and said it was their mistake?

272
00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.544 line:80%
Yes, but it was true.

273
00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:29.591 line:80%
While we were away for just a second,
their employee started the tasting event.

274
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.134 line:80%
Both of you?

275
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.803 line:80%
Why were you both away?

276
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.264 line:80%
Well...

277
00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:39.934 line:80%
Mr. Park and Ms. Jeong
were in charge, right?

278
00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.526 line:80%
What a bastard.

279
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.113 line:80%
What a bastard.

280
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.368 line:80%
No!

281
00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.287 line:80%
What are you all thinking?

282
00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.041 line:80%
Ji-won.

283
00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:10.381 line:80%
Mr. Park handled it well
with the customer,

284
00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.134 line:80%
but not reporting it is an issue.

285
00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.221 line:80%
Well...

286
00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.318 line:80%

FILTER BY: PARK MIN-HWAN, BERMUDA

289
00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:43.331 line:80%
The situation in marketing
is being shared through company email.

290
00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:47.544 line:80%
So I've banned key words
like "Mr. Park," "Bermuda Park,"

291
00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.045 line:80%
and "Park Min-hwan."

292
00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.507 line:80%
Right. "Panties Park" as well.

293
00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:59.138 line:80%
All company emails containing
these words won't be sent.

294
00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.182 line:80%
And the same with messengers.

295
00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:09.107 line:80%
I guess I can avoid
being talked about at work.

296
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:10.692 line:80%
However,

297
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:16.281 line:80%
these protective measures will only be
valid if you accept being transferred.

298
00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.492 line:80%
To a different department?

299
00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:23.663 line:80%
It's hard to make you
a full-time employee now.

300
00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.373 line:80%
The contract isn't up yet,

301
00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:29.711 line:80%
but the company wants to let you go
after you work until today.

302
00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:34.799 line:80%
Do you consent?

303
00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.776 line:80%
Ji-won, please pick up.

304
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.077 line:80%

MEN CAN'T REFUSE A WOMAN'S SEDUCTION

307
00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:16.424 line:80%
Why are they all after me?

308
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:21.346 line:80%
Who do they think they are?
What the hell do they know about me?

309
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.266 line:80%
Ji-won and I are...

310
00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.605 line:80%
OTHER HALF

311
00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.419 line:80%
No way.

312
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:55.505 line:80%
The company has a system.

313
00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:59.050 line:80%
How could Yang Ju-ran become my boss?

314
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:05.264 line:80%
Ms. Yang's successfully running
the meal kit project that could've failed.

315
00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.558 line:80%
The company's grateful.

316
00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:11.854 line:80%
On the other hand, in addition
to related cases, your work capacity,

317
00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:15.942 line:80%
attendance, peer-to-peer evaluation,
and misogyny are disappointing.

318
00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:18.361 line:80%
What...

319
00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.905 line:80%
Misogyny? What does that even mean?

320
00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:26.744 line:80%
This is a notice.

321
00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:30.623 line:80%
If you can't accept it,
can I take it as your will to resign?

Damn it! Yang Ju-ran.

324
00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:00.653 line:80%
You change my seat.

325
00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:04.907 line:80%
Yes, sir.

326
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:07.493 line:80%
Ms. Yang.

327
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:45.531 line:80%
You can't smoke...

328
00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:50.536 line:80%
Oh, you weren't.

329
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.920 line:80%
Why are you here?

330
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:06.803 line:80%
I come here to think in peace alone.

331
00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:09.430 line:80%
The company's a place of work.

332
00:23:09.972 --> 00:23:11.766 line:80%
It's not a place to think.

333
00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:17.814 line:80%
Didn't you come here
to think on your own too?

334
00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:22.485 line:80%
You don't seem like the type
to come to storage yourself.

335
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.239 line:80%
Again...

336
00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:29.075 line:80%
A know-it-all.

337
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.332 line:80%
Aren't you the type to be cold

338
00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:38.751 line:80%
to those you care about the most?

339
00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:41.921 line:80%
U&K HRD INSTITUTE

340
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.383 line:80%
Those who think they know

341
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.760 line:80%
and judge people rashly...

342
00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:50.638 line:80%
Personally, I hate people like you.

343
00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.602 line:80%
You were promoted but don't look happy.

344
00:23:57.353 --> 00:23:59.730 line:80%
If it's because of Mr. Kim, don't worry.

345
00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:03.609 line:80%
With your performance,
you should've been promoted sooner.

346
00:24:04.152 --> 00:24:07.655 line:80%
Is the meal kit
a big chunk of that performance?

347
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.452 line:80%
This is Kang Ji-won's project.

348
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.831 line:80%
The idea, planning, and execution.

349
00:24:17.582 --> 00:24:20.543 line:80%
If someone should get promoted for this,

350
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:22.503 line:80%
it's Ms. Kang.

351
00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:29.177 line:80%
I feel better after saying that.

352
00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:35.600 line:80%
Please take that into consideration.

353
00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:40.771 line:80%
Kim Gyeong-uk...

354
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:44.400 line:80%
also got promoted with your proposal.

355
00:24:49.697 --> 00:24:51.240 line:80%
You're the losing type.

356
00:24:52.783 --> 00:24:54.285 line:80%
Those who think they know

357
00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:56.746 line:80%
and judge people rashly...

358
00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:03.419 line:80%
I personally like them.

359
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:05.796 line:80%
If they are right.

360
00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:09.884 line:80%
And you're right.

361
00:25:10.885 --> 00:25:12.261 line:80%
I'm a pushover.

362
00:25:13.054 --> 00:25:14.722 line:80%
That makes me comfortable.

363
00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:26.567 line:80%
Why did you tell HR that?

364
00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:29.362 line:80%
We worked together.

365
00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:32.240 line:80%
And I think it's right you get promoted.

366
00:25:34.617 --> 00:25:36.327 line:80%
I don't like feeling uneasy.

367
00:25:37.036 --> 00:25:39.372 line:80%
I was uncomfortable being the leader.

368
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.125 line:80%
This project is yours.

369
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.631 line:80%
I'm sorry.
When Mr. Kim wanted to exclude you,

370
00:25:49.382 --> 00:25:51.050 line:80%
I should've fixed it then.

371
00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:55.263 line:80%
I learned while working with you

372
00:25:56.222 --> 00:25:58.182 line:80%
that you're such a great person

373
00:25:58.683 --> 00:26:02.353 line:80%
and how much fun work can be
when working with good people.

374
00:26:06.607 --> 00:26:09.735 line:80%
I don't know what HR will decide,

375
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:13.864 line:80%
but you're the coolest to me.

376
00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:21.914 line:80%
You're the coolest to me too.

377
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:26.544 line:80%
Ms. Yang, Ms. Kang.

378
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.048 line:80%
I think you should go downstairs.

379
00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:32.133 line:80%
What?

380
00:26:33.884 --> 00:26:35.845 line:80%
Kang Ji-won, come out!

381
00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:37.847 line:80%
Why are you blocking me?

382
00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:40.308 line:80%
I almost died!

383
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.438 line:80%
Who is Kang Ji-won?
Why would she say this?

384
00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:48.983 line:80%
I want to see if she knows
what she's talking about!

385
00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:53.779 line:80%
She revealed her name.
Doesn't that mean she's confident?

386
00:26:53.863 --> 00:26:56.365 line:80%
-So why block us?
-Calm down.

387
00:26:56.449 --> 00:26:57.742 line:80%
Hello.

388
00:26:57.825 --> 00:27:00.870 line:80%
I'm Kang Ji-won of Marketing Team 1.

389
00:27:02.997 --> 00:27:06.250 line:80%
-All right.
-Are you Kang Ji-won?

390
00:27:16.761 --> 00:27:17.595 line:80%
Nice.

391
00:27:21.057 --> 00:27:25.436 line:80%
Hey. We pretended to be dying
because we liked free things?

392
00:27:25.519 --> 00:27:28.272 line:80%
Do you think allergies are a joke?

393
00:27:28.356 --> 00:27:30.858 line:80%
You people messed up, but we let it go.

394
00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:33.027 line:80%
My husband almost died!

395
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.195 line:80%
He almost died!

396
00:27:42.286 --> 00:27:44.997 line:80%
I'm sorry, but may I see your phone?

397
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.551 line:80%
Hello.

398
00:27:57.635 --> 00:28:01.347 line:80%
I'm Kang Ji-won, the person involved
in the scandal at U&K.

399
00:28:02.223 --> 00:28:05.601 line:80%
I'm trembling, so I'll put it simply.

400
00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:09.563 line:80%
First, the triangle relationship
is completely false.

401
00:28:09.647 --> 00:28:13.734 line:80%
It's true that the man I was
about to marry fell for my friend.

402
00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:17.196 line:80%
However, my friend didn't reciprocate
his feelings.

403
00:28:17.822 --> 00:28:19.865 line:80%
She's such an attractive woman,

404
00:28:19.949 --> 00:28:22.952 line:80%
so I'm trying to accept it as unavoidable.

405
00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:27.957 line:80%
And the incident at Jomart
was a typical case

406
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.835 line:80%
where problematic consumers
schemed to get freebies.

407
00:28:30.918 --> 00:28:33.546 line:80%
They ate it
without checking the ingredients.

408
00:28:33.629 --> 00:28:36.507 line:80%
It can't happen to those
with serious allergies.

409
00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:38.843 line:80%
My friend is innocent.

410
00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:40.970 line:80%
"My friend is innocent."

411
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.807 line:80%
It pains me that she's blamed.

412
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.142 line:80%
KANG JI-WON

413
00:28:52.815 --> 00:28:55.943 line:80%
No one in their right mind
would write such a thing!

414
00:28:57.695 --> 00:28:59.989 line:80%
I didn't write this.

415
00:29:00.573 --> 00:29:02.283 line:80%
But it is my handwriting.

416
00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:04.743 line:80%
I know someone

417
00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:08.164 line:80%
who has the same handwriting as me.

418
00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:14.170 line:80%
Jeong Su-min, stop!

419
00:29:26.474 --> 00:29:27.683 line:80%
Ji-won.

420
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:30.352 line:80%
I won't let it go this time.

421
00:29:30.436 --> 00:29:32.646 line:80%
You fix what you did.

422
00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:36.859 line:80%
Wait, Ji-won.

423
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:46.744 line:80%
Ji-won...

424
00:29:46.827 --> 00:29:48.913 line:80%
What are you doing? Don't do it.

425
00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:52.208 line:80%
Don't forget that I know as much

426
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:55.586 line:80%
about you as you know about me.

427
00:30:03.511 --> 00:30:05.179 line:80%
MODU COMMUNITY
U&K FOOD, KANG JI-WON

428
00:30:21.862 --> 00:30:23.864 line:80%
Why is someone else's name here?

429
00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:26.367 line:80%
As a U&K employee,

430
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.994 line:80%
I am very sorry about this incident.

431
00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:33.374 line:80%
However, you deserve an apology
from the right person.

432
00:30:37.628 --> 00:30:39.255 line:80%
Honey.

433
00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:40.965 line:80%
She's that woman.

434
00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:44.635 line:80%
The one who was
with the guy named Mr. Park.

435
00:30:49.932 --> 00:30:51.183 line:80%
So it was a frame-up?

436
00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:55.229 line:80%
So she stole her man
and used her to defend herself.

437
00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:57.815 line:80%
Because no one would believe her.

438
00:31:11.829 --> 00:31:13.455 line:80%
I'm very sorry.

439
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.417 line:80%
The situation...

440
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.295 line:80%
It was moving in such a bad direction,

441
00:31:19.378 --> 00:31:22.381 line:80%
so I needed an excuse,
but I crossed the line.

442
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:25.551 line:80%
I wasn't trying to insult you two.

443
00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:29.471 line:80%
You must be very offended,
but I didn't think that far.

444
00:31:30.097 --> 00:31:32.850 line:80%
It's all my fault. I was wrong. I'm sorry.

445
00:31:34.435 --> 00:31:35.644 line:80%
Miss.

446
00:31:35.728 --> 00:31:37.062 line:80%
I'm sorry.

447
00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:40.733 line:80%
-I apologize.
-I'm fine.

448
00:31:42.735 --> 00:31:45.029 line:80%
I felt like I was going insane!

449
00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:49.950 line:80%
I know I shouldn't have.

450
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:53.912 line:80%
But...

451
00:31:54.747 --> 00:31:57.291 line:80%
I'm so emotional these days.

452
00:31:58.626 --> 00:32:00.711 line:80%
I know I'm a terrible person.

453
00:32:00.794 --> 00:32:02.254 line:80%
But I thought

454
00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:09.219 line:80%
I might end up doing something I'd regret.
That's why I did it.

455
00:32:17.978 --> 00:32:18.937 line:80%
Ji-won.

456
00:32:20.314 --> 00:32:21.690 line:80%
I'm really sorry.

457
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:28.614 line:80%
Can you please forgive me?

458
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:33.452 line:80%
I...

459
00:32:34.995 --> 00:32:37.039 line:80%
can't live without you right now.

460
00:32:47.174 --> 00:32:48.300 line:80%
Ji-won.

461
00:32:55.015 --> 00:32:56.100 line:80%
I'm pregnant.

462
00:33:11.532 --> 00:33:13.534 line:80%
Pregnant...

463
00:33:25.129 --> 00:33:26.797 line:80%

Park Min-hwan...

465
00:33:30.426 --> 00:33:31.552 line:80%
Park Min-hwan...

466
00:33:33.095 --> 00:33:34.096 line:80%
is me.

467
00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.141 line:80%
And Kang Ji-won...

468
00:33:38.851 --> 00:33:39.852 line:80%
is crazy.

469
00:33:41.895 --> 00:33:43.313 line:80%
And Jeong Su-min...

470
00:33:44.273 --> 00:33:45.566 line:80%
has lost it.

471
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.784 line:80%
My life is over!

483
00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:10.651 line:80%
I guess I do look young.

484
00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:12.736 line:80%
Yeah, you look quite young.

485
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.530 line:80%

488

I'm just worried something bad
will happen to you, sirs!

489

By chance, where are you from?

490
00:35:30.754 --> 00:35:33.423 line:80%
Are you from Snake Loans?

491
00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:38.345 line:80%
Or is it Viper Financial?

492
00:35:38.428 --> 00:35:39.513 line:80%
Where?

493
00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:41.181 line:80%
Goodness.

494
00:35:41.849 --> 00:35:43.600 line:80%
You borrowed from Snake too?

495
00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:48.313 line:80%
They don't hit people.
I hear they like to cut, right?

496
00:35:48.397 --> 00:35:50.232 line:80%
-Cut?
-Yeah. They do.

497
00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:52.734 line:80%
-Here.
-Yeah.

498
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.695 line:80%
-Here?
-Yeah.

499
00:35:59.283 --> 00:36:02.452 line:80%
Hey! I'll pay you back! I will!

500
00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:04.788 line:80%
-What?
-Go easy.

501
00:36:06.415 --> 00:36:09.501 line:80%
You said you had no money.
You suddenly got some?

502
00:36:09.585 --> 00:36:11.169 line:80%
I don't have money.

503
00:36:11.253 --> 00:36:12.546 line:80%
But my parents do.

504
00:36:12.629 --> 00:36:15.716 line:80%
As soon as I get married,
they'll get me a house!

505
00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:19.011 line:80%
I'll pay you back with that. Yes!

506
00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:22.598 line:80%
They always have money
when their lives are on the line.

507
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:24.182 line:80%
When's the wedding?

508
00:36:24.266 --> 00:36:25.517 line:80%
Right away!

509
00:36:25.601 --> 00:36:27.019 line:80%
The woman I'll marry...

510
00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:31.899 line:80%
I have a pregnant woman.
Yeah, I impregnated her.

511
00:36:31.982 --> 00:36:35.736 line:80%
I'll get it, and I'll pay you back.

512
00:36:55.005 --> 00:36:56.298 line:80%
Ji-hyuk.

513
00:36:56.381 --> 00:36:58.175 line:80%
-Hello, Ji-hyuk.
-It's cold.

514
00:36:58.258 --> 00:37:00.719 line:80%
You should've waited at the store.

515
00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:03.722 line:80%
I'm sorry I asked you to do this.

516
00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:06.224 line:80%
You can ask us to do anything.

517
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.020 line:80%
Isn't that the guy we took the chicken to?

518
00:37:10.103 --> 00:37:12.731 line:80%
What's going on? He's got a lot of debt.

519
00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:20.364 line:80%
Ji-hyuk, we haven't finished yet.

520
00:37:20.447 --> 00:37:21.949 line:80%
We'll go finish now.

521
00:37:22.032 --> 00:37:23.325 line:80%
We'll be right back.

522
00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:27.329 line:80%
It's so cold.

523
00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:36.046 line:80%
Kang Ji-won will become happy.

524
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.051 line:80%
She'll be happy.

525
00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:53.814 line:80%
Mom.

526
00:37:54.982 --> 00:37:57.776 line:80%
You said you'd get me a house
if I got married.

527
00:37:58.527 --> 00:38:01.029 line:80%
Can you do that for me now?

528
00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:03.824 line:80%
All you got me was red long johns.

529
00:38:03.907 --> 00:38:05.826 line:80%
Why would I get you a house?

530
00:38:05.909 --> 00:38:08.036 line:80%
Maybe if you give me a grandchild.

531
00:38:08.537 --> 00:38:11.456 line:80%
I'm not kidding around, Mom!

532
00:38:12.374 --> 00:38:14.334 line:80%
It's urgent for me.

533
00:38:14.418 --> 00:38:16.003 line:80%
Do you trust me?

534
00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:17.879 line:80%
Don't you love me?

535
00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:21.508 line:80%
I'm your son! Park Min-hwan.
Your one and only son.

536
00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:28.765 line:80%
Where the heck are you going?

537
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:30.517 line:80%
Damn it!

538
00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:37.065 line:80%
My God! What the heck?

539
00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:42.738 line:80%
Hey, what are you doing there?

540
00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:45.866 line:80%
Hey.

541
00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:49.953 line:80%
Hey, Su-min?

542
00:38:50.996 --> 00:38:52.748 line:80%
What are you doing?

543
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:58.462 line:80%
You said I was just a pretty face,
so why are you here?

544
00:39:01.465 --> 00:39:05.510 line:80%
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?

545
00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:09.473 line:80%
Does that change anything?

546
00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:20.317 line:80%
Right. I was a bit harsh, wasn't I?

547
00:39:22.152 --> 00:39:25.447 line:80%
I didn't really mean that, but I...

548
00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:29.868 line:80%
You know how guys are, right?

549
00:39:33.038 --> 00:39:34.664 line:80%
So it does changes things.

550
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.794 line:80%
Not with Ji-won though.

551
00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:42.839 line:80%
She won't even talk to me.
Even though I'm pregnant.

552
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:44.424 line:80%
Dummy.

553
00:39:44.508 --> 00:39:46.968 line:80%
You seem smart,

554
00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:49.387 line:80%
but you're strangely sloppy.

555
00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:52.849 line:80%
That's my baby. Of course, that hurts her.

556
00:39:52.933 --> 00:39:54.768 line:80%
She likes me so much.

557
00:39:57.312 --> 00:39:58.313 line:80%
Really?

558
00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:01.817 line:80%
I'm pregnant.

559
00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:07.364 line:80%
Of course.

560
00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:10.200 line:80%
She's spiteful,
so she doesn't let it show,

561
00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:12.410 line:80%
but you know it too.

562
00:40:13.078 --> 00:40:14.538 line:80%
She's fragile inside.

563
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:18.500 line:80%
I'm sure she's hurt and upset
ever since she learned about us.

564
00:40:19.084 --> 00:40:20.544 line:80%
And now you're pregnant.

565
00:40:21.128 --> 00:40:23.004 line:80%
She's probably a mess.

566
00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:27.175 line:80%
You think so?

567
00:40:31.513 --> 00:40:33.056 line:80%
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

568
00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:37.727 line:80%
Wow, the gods have helped.

569
00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:41.523 line:80%
Ms. Kang, what if you knew nothing
and actually got married?

570
00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:43.024 line:80%
Throw that trash away.

571
00:40:43.692 --> 00:40:46.653 line:80%
It's funny, I think the trash
hates the trashcan.

572
00:40:47.404 --> 00:40:50.323 line:80%
Did you see Mr. Park's face
when she said it?

573
00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:56.037 line:80%
Pregnant? Su-min,
what are you trying to pull?

574
00:40:56.121 --> 00:40:58.623 line:80%
I'm sure Park Min-hwan has azoospermia.

575
00:40:58.707 --> 00:41:00.125 line:80%
How's the food?

576
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:02.002 line:80%
It's so good.

577
00:41:02.544 --> 00:41:03.879 line:80%
Need anything else?

578
00:41:04.838 --> 00:41:06.715 line:80%
No, this is already so great.

579
00:41:06.798 --> 00:41:07.799 line:80%
Thanks.

580
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:09.759 line:80%
That's good.

581
00:41:09.843 --> 00:41:11.178 line:80%
Have a good time.

582
00:41:13.972 --> 00:41:15.140 line:80%
Still...

583
00:41:17.184 --> 00:41:20.604 line:80%
I thought Ji-won would take my side
in the end.

584
00:41:22.689 --> 00:41:23.857 line:80%
It's understandable

585
00:41:24.774 --> 00:41:27.736 line:80%
that she was mad at me
and ignored my texts.

586
00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:33.575 line:80%
But if she saw people treating me harshly,

587
00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:37.495 line:80%
I thought she would take my side.

588
00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:42.334 line:80%
She always did.

589
00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:44.252 line:80%
Even if it was strange.

590
00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:47.255 line:80%
Even if it was wrong.

591
00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:48.882 line:80%
Even if she was mad.

592
00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:53.929 line:80%
Still, in the end,

593
00:41:54.554 --> 00:41:57.015 line:80%
she always forgave me and understood.

594
00:42:00.644 --> 00:42:01.895 line:80%
I think...

595
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.523 line:80%
I have to be that person to you now.

596
00:42:07.776 --> 00:42:09.819 line:80%
Break away from her now.

597
00:42:09.903 --> 00:42:11.571 line:80%
It's not like you're dating.

598
00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:15.367 line:80%
Let's let her go.

599
00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:18.954 line:80%
Let's only think about us.

600
00:42:20.914 --> 00:42:21.957 line:80%
Us?

601
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:31.549 line:80%
Shall we...

602
00:42:33.718 --> 00:42:35.136 line:80%
get married?

603
00:42:40.809 --> 00:42:42.644 line:80%
I said terrible things to you,

604
00:42:43.687 --> 00:42:45.397 line:80%
trying not to like you.

605
00:42:47.357 --> 00:42:49.067 line:80%
But I think you're the one.

606
00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:57.242 line:80%
Shall we...

607
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.453 line:80%
Shall we get married?

608
00:43:01.454 --> 00:43:03.039 line:80%
We'll be...

609
00:43:03.123 --> 00:43:07.836 line:80%
But we'll be
a better family tomorrow than we are now.

610
00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:10.630 line:80%
I promise.

611
00:43:13.717 --> 00:43:16.094 line:80%
...a better family tomorrow
than we are now.

612
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.723 line:80%
I promise.

613
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:27.856 line:80%
A family?

614
00:43:29.274 --> 00:43:30.233 line:80%
Yes.

615
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.998 line:80%
INCIDENT REPORT,
NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION

616
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:48.126 line:80%
So the problem wasn't Kang Ji-won

617
00:43:48.209 --> 00:43:50.337 line:80%
but her fiancé and friend?

618
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.296 line:80%
Yes, sir.

619
00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:54.799 line:80%
But the employee is pregnant,

620
00:43:54.883 --> 00:43:57.427 line:80%
so the customers decided to let it go.

621
00:43:57.927 --> 00:43:59.929 line:80%
HR took action on the two employees.

622
00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:04.768 line:80%
And Ms. Kang Ji-won was right
about the meal kit case as well.

623
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:07.812 line:80%
It's common for managers
to steal proposals.

624
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:11.900 line:80%
So Kang Ji-won's the victim.

625
00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:13.985 line:80%
I need to meet her.

626
00:44:31.711 --> 00:44:32.545 line:80%
Let's go.

627
00:44:39.386 --> 00:44:44.015 line:80%
I heard you went through a lot recently.

628
00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:49.020 line:80%
I've decided to face the obstacles
that are bound to happen.

629
00:44:51.523 --> 00:44:55.360 line:80%
I guess there are
many difficult people around you.

630
00:44:58.488 --> 00:45:00.323 line:80%
There aren't that many,

631
00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:03.868 line:80%
but there are some tough ones.

632
00:45:06.663 --> 00:45:08.957 line:80%
Am I one of them?

633
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.628 line:80%
I think so.

634
00:45:17.757 --> 00:45:21.219 line:80%
So what are you going to do from now on?

635
00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:29.102 line:80%
-Right now?
-Yes, go quickly.

636
00:45:34.524 --> 00:45:36.901 line:80%
-Grandfather!
-My goodness.

637
00:45:37.569 --> 00:45:39.571 line:80%
You're scaring my guest.

638
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:48.913 line:80%
The chairman didn't say much.

639
00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:50.957 line:80%
So you don't have to worry.

640
00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.793 line:80%
I'll make sure this won't happen again.
I'm sorry.

641
00:45:54.711 --> 00:45:56.421 line:80%
Why would you be sorry?

642
00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:01.926 line:80%
Anyway, it's amazing
that I got to see him in person.

643
00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:05.221 line:80%
And he wasn't as difficult as I'd thought.

644
00:46:06.306 --> 00:46:07.807 line:80%
Yes, he is.

645
00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:11.811 line:80%
I told him the truth.

646
00:46:11.895 --> 00:46:14.314 line:80%
That when my boss stole my proposal,

647
00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:16.983 line:80%
maybe I should've just let it slide,

648
00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:18.610 line:80%
but I don't regret it now.

649
00:46:20.487 --> 00:46:22.238 line:80%
That's an answer he'd like.

650
00:46:25.658 --> 00:46:29.454 line:80%
And he brought up my private life first.

651
00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:34.417 line:80%
He said I shouldn't blame my foot
for stepping on crap.

SECOND HAND MARKET

653
00:46:43.676 --> 00:46:46.596 line:80%
Buying a positive pregnancy test
and sonogram photo.

654
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.058 line:80%
POSTED

655
00:46:52.393 --> 00:46:53.770 line:80%
Family.

656
00:46:57.357 --> 00:46:58.608 line:80%
A new start.

657
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.154 line:80%
Park Min-hwan and Jeong Su-min
will marry soon.

658
00:47:03.238 --> 00:47:04.906 line:80%
You can start over now.

659
00:47:05.657 --> 00:47:06.616 line:80%
Right.

660
00:47:07.242 --> 00:47:08.159 line:80%
Well...

661
00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:12.622 line:80%
I'll feel relieved
once they actually decide to.

662
00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:16.668 line:80%
They'll do it.

663
00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:19.587 line:80%
There's no other way for him to get money.

664
00:47:21.214 --> 00:47:22.632 line:80%
What do you mean?

665
00:47:23.216 --> 00:47:25.760 line:80%
I checked his financial situation.

666
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:28.638 line:80%
His stock credit is bad,
and he took out loans.

667
00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:31.015 line:80%
He's under pressure to pay.

668
00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:34.435 line:80%
He already received his severance pay.

669
00:47:34.519 --> 00:47:38.731 line:80%
And he was demoted due to the recent
incident, so his salary was cut.

670
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:42.777 line:80%
How did you check all that?

671
00:47:43.945 --> 00:47:45.238 line:80%
Remember what I said?

672
00:47:46.155 --> 00:47:48.157 line:80%
I used to only do what was right.

673
00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:50.868 line:80%
It's not true.

674
00:47:52.495 --> 00:47:54.080 line:80%
My grandfather knew

675
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:56.457 line:80%
that I just...

676
00:47:58.001 --> 00:47:59.460 line:80%
didn't want anything.

677
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.092 line:80%
Want to shoot a gun?

678
00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:13.891 line:80%
I had a lot of things to do.

679
00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:17.186 line:80%
And I'd come here to pull the trigger.

680
00:48:18.438 --> 00:48:20.523 line:80%
Because I could do things I hated

681
00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:21.899 line:80%
after thinking,

682
00:48:22.525 --> 00:48:25.320 line:80%
"The bullet's already shot.
It can't be undone."

683
00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:27.822 line:80%
"Let's just do it."

684
00:48:36.789 --> 00:48:40.293 line:80%
But it's so hard to resist
what I want right now.

685
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:56.726 line:80%
There are many things I can do.

686
00:48:57.935 --> 00:48:59.354 line:80%
What's changed

687
00:48:59.854 --> 00:49:03.107 line:80%
is that now I'm doing something
that can help you too.

688
00:49:06.361 --> 00:49:08.321 line:80%
Hold on tight and lean on me.

689
00:49:47.819 --> 00:49:49.195 line:80%
You're amazing!

690
00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:51.906 line:80%
You fix a meal so easily.

691
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:53.825 line:80%
I have no talent for cooking.

692
00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:56.160 line:80%
But this package is so easy.

693
00:49:56.244 --> 00:49:58.830 line:80%
You don't eat at home, do you?

694
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:01.332 line:80%
No, I always order in since I live alone.

695
00:50:02.041 --> 00:50:04.293 line:80%
Don't do that. Think of your health.

696
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:09.006 line:80%
I messed up my stomach once,
so I try my best to eat what I cook.

697
00:50:11.718 --> 00:50:14.512 line:80%
It tastes so good.

698
00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:16.639 line:80%
You're perfect.

699
00:50:18.224 --> 00:50:20.685 line:80%
Will you marry me?

700
00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:23.020 line:80%
I'll never get married.

701
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.690 line:80%
No, you have to.

702
00:50:26.607 --> 00:50:27.984 line:80%
Even if that's true,

703
00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:31.237 line:80%
an ex being happy with another woman
is so annoying.

704
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.448 line:80%
So you have to be happy first.

705
00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:37.118 line:80%
What's your type? A handsome face? Body?

706
00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:45.042 line:80%
I'll get it.

707
00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.172 line:80%
It's Baek Eun-ho.

708
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:52.091 line:80%
No, don't answer it. I'll call back.

709
00:50:52.175 --> 00:50:53.468 line:80%
Just take it.

710
00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:57.138 line:80%
A call from a handsome man on Christmas
should be answered.

711
00:51:00.433 --> 00:51:01.642 line:80%
Hey, Eun-ho.

712
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.521 line:80%
What?

713
00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:30.630 line:80%
-Hey.
-Hey.

714
00:51:31.297 --> 00:51:33.299 line:80%
-Were you waiting long?
-No.

715
00:51:34.759 --> 00:51:36.469 line:80%
-Hello.
-Hello.

716
00:51:36.552 --> 00:51:39.222 line:80%
You drive so carefully.

717
00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:41.098 line:80%
Well...

718
00:51:41.182 --> 00:51:43.476 line:80%
I don't drive often, so...

719
00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:45.561 line:80%
This is my first time since then.

720
00:51:46.813 --> 00:51:48.981 line:80%
-Since when?
-He drove us home

721
00:51:49.065 --> 00:51:52.777 line:80%
after my brother passed out drunk
at his restaurant.

722
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:56.072 line:80%
I was so flustered, but he saved me.

723
00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:59.367 line:80%
Mr. Yu got drunk and passed out?

724
00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:03.120 line:80%
At Eun-ho's restaurant at that?

725
00:52:04.288 --> 00:52:07.458 line:80%
But if Kang Ji-won is
the one wrong sentence in it...

726
00:52:09.377 --> 00:52:10.670 line:80%
How would you feel?

727
00:52:13.256 --> 00:52:15.800 line:80%
I know, right? He comes often.

728
00:52:16.926 --> 00:52:19.595 line:80%
Because he's got high standards for food.

729
00:52:21.806 --> 00:52:23.558 line:80%
So, what do you want to do?

730
00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:24.725 line:80%
Where shall we go?

731
00:52:28.312 --> 00:52:29.897 line:80%
You're not coming?

732
00:52:29.981 --> 00:52:31.399 line:80%
Come on.

733
00:52:31.482 --> 00:52:33.484 line:80%
It's Christmas! I have plans.

734
00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:37.780 line:80%
Go ahead. Have fun!

735
00:52:39.574 --> 00:52:40.575 line:80%
Okay.

736
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:58.718 line:80%
It's Christmas, and I have no plans!

737
00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:06.642 line:80%
They looked so good together.

738
00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:15.693 line:80%
Oh, my.

739
00:53:15.776 --> 00:53:18.988 line:80%
You're eating ice cream?
You look human for a change.

740
00:53:19.572 --> 00:53:20.406 line:80%
Give me some.

741
00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:24.493 line:80%
What?

742
00:53:24.577 --> 00:53:27.246 line:80%
You told me to help them get closer.

743
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:28.998 line:80%
I did such a great job.

744
00:53:29.081 --> 00:53:30.583 line:80%
So why do you look upset?

745
00:53:31.751 --> 00:53:33.002 line:80%
Does he seem decent?

746
00:53:34.086 --> 00:53:34.921 line:80%
Yes.

747
00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.134 line:80%
He may be kind of boring,

748
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:43.054 line:80%
but he's comfortable.
He's handsome and stable.

749
00:53:44.472 --> 00:53:47.224 line:80%
Ms. Kang acts strong, but she has anxiety.

750
00:53:50.061 --> 00:53:53.981 line:80%
And most importantly,
there's love pouring from his eyes.

751
00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:02.531 line:80%
What? Why? Why do your actions
not match your words?

752
00:54:02.615 --> 00:54:05.368 line:80%
You said nothing was going on with her.

753
00:54:05.451 --> 00:54:08.829 line:80%
You said to set her up with a decent guy!

754
00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:25.262 line:80%
Eat it like this?

755
00:54:38.734 --> 00:54:41.445 line:80%
I mean, she should meet a decent guy soon.

756
00:54:41.529 --> 00:54:44.865 line:80%
I think she dreams
of spending Christmas with family at home.

757
00:54:45.741 --> 00:54:49.704 line:80%
Twinkling lights and gifts under the tree.

758
00:54:49.787 --> 00:54:51.789 line:80%
A cake and a music box.

759
00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:54.917 line:80%
Maybe some Santa hats and stockings.

760
00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:26.365 line:80%
You must be cold.
Want something warm to drink?

761
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:29.160 line:80%
I'll be right back.

762
00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:53.267 line:80%
Will I be able to live like this
if they get married?

763
00:56:16.832 --> 00:56:21.337 line:80%
The restaurant is busy on Christmas night,
so I have to go.

764
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:22.463 line:80%
Sorry.

765
00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:24.048 line:80%
Don't be sorry.

766
00:56:24.673 --> 00:56:26.717 line:80%
Thanks for spending time with me.

767
00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:29.136 line:80%
No.

768
00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.889 line:80%
I really enjoyed today.

769
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:37.228 line:80%
I'm glad if it cheered you up a little,

770
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:38.896 line:80%
and next time...

771
00:56:38.979 --> 00:56:40.064 line:80%
Eun-ho.

772
00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:46.320 line:80%
You're a great friend.

773
00:56:58.207 --> 00:57:01.752 line:80%
I'm so happy I met you again.

774
00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:04.296 line:80%
You shouldn't be like that.

775
00:57:05.297 --> 00:57:06.590 line:80%
That I got to...

776
00:57:06.674 --> 00:57:09.426 line:80%
I never want to speak to you again.

777
00:57:10.136 --> 00:57:12.471 line:80%
...see the real you.

778
00:57:12.555 --> 00:57:13.722 line:80%
I...

779
00:57:15.182 --> 00:57:16.517 line:80%
had a crush on you!

780
00:57:23.357 --> 00:57:24.525 line:80%
Thank you.

781
00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:33.784 line:80%
I'll be a great friend to you too.

782
00:57:50.384 --> 00:57:51.343 line:80%
Yeah.

783
00:57:52.761 --> 00:57:53.888 line:80%
Thanks.

784
00:57:54.763 --> 00:57:55.973 line:80%
My first love.

785
00:58:04.356 --> 00:58:05.232 line:80%
Here.

786
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.559 line:80%
The wrong sentence in your novel

787
00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:42.853 line:80%
must not be me.

788
00:59:08.587 --> 00:59:09.588 line:80%
Mr. Yu?

789
00:59:17.805 --> 00:59:19.598 line:80%
What are you doing out here?

790
00:59:19.682 --> 00:59:21.976 line:80%
I came out for some air.

791
00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:23.936 line:80%
I was about to go in.

792
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.027 line:80%
It seems you got a lot of air.

793
00:59:33.737 --> 00:59:35.155 line:80%
No, well...

794
00:59:39.868 --> 00:59:40.953 line:80%
I...

795
00:59:54.425 --> 00:59:55.843 line:80%
Mr. Yu.

796
01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.308 line:80%
I have something to tell you.

797
01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:06.228 line:80%
Can you come to my place?

798
01:00:06.312 --> 01:00:07.980 line:80%
Or shall I go to your place?

799
01:00:52.358 --> 01:00:55.944 line:80%
What were you going to do
if I didn't ask to talk?

800
01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.783 line:80%
I would've asked you to.

801
01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:11.168 line:80%
To be honest with you,
I went on a date with Eun-ho today.

802
01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:12.461 line:80%
My first love.

803
01:01:16.382 --> 01:01:20.302 line:80%
Also, he told me he liked me.

804
01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:24.515 line:80%
I heard.

805
01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:28.560 line:80%
I stood there for a while.

806
01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:37.152 line:80%
Why did you turn him down? He seems nice.

807
01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.075 line:80%
He is a nice guy.

808
01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:44.743 line:80%
That's why I liked him.

809
01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:49.581 line:80%
But...

810
01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:54.086 line:80%
I don't feel the same way.

811
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:08.892 line:80%
Do you remember when I asked you
to let me be honest with you?

812
01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:13.564 line:80%
Just let me be honest with you
from time to time.

813
01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:20.112 line:80%
I've never once
been honest about my feelings.

814
01:02:26.702 --> 01:02:28.454 line:80%
I want to be honest now.

When I was with Eun-ho,

816
01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:40.340 line:80%
I kept thinking about someone else.

817
01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:45.304 line:80%
Someone I thought I knew everything about,

818
01:02:45.888 --> 01:02:47.306 line:80%
but I didn't at all.

819
01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:51.935 line:80%
I'm sure there's more
I don't know about him.

820
01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:55.147 line:80%
But...

821
01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:01.320 line:80%
he's someone only I can know.

822
01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:04.615 line:80%
And...

823
01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:10.120 line:80%
he knows me the best.

824
01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.709 line:80%
When you told me how you felt,

825
01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:41.336 line:80%
I thought it was the reason I came back.

826
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.547 line:80%
I get that you like Kang Ji-won.

827
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.925 line:80%
But you don't seem like the type to meddle
with Min-hwan and Su-min.

828
01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:49.928 line:80%
If it concerns Ji-won, it concerns me.

829
01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.347 line:80%
Where did things go wrong?

830
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:53.640 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

831
01:04:53.724 --> 01:04:55.851 line:80%
I'm not the right person for you.

832
01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.978 line:80%
Because I want you to be happy.

833
01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.272 line:80%
I need to collect at your wedding!

834
01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:02.941 line:80%
The man and family
that used to be Ji-won's.

835
01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:04.318 line:80%
They're all mine now.

836
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:09.323 line:80%
Congratulations on picking up my trash.
