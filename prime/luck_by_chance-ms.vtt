00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.060 line:82%
Screen test? What is this screen test?

2
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.400 line:82%
Maker's eye is the camera,

3
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.770 line:82%
when you entered my office
I knew that she...

4
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.560 line:82%
is the one I'm looking for.

5
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.480 line:82%
Sona, perfect name for screen.

6
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.310 line:82%
Sona, whatever the character demands,

7
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.940 line:82%
you should give it. You won't believe
when I say it,

8
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.560 line:82%
It is all destiny.

9
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.270 line:82%
Destiny has brought you from Kanpur
to Pinky Productions.

10
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.270 line:82%
Everything is written here.

11
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.400 line:82%
You start visiting me often, because,

12
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.900 line:82%
it's important for an artist and a creator
to know each other well.

13
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.350 line:82%
And to understand each other we need
to spend time together.

14
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.520 line:82%
Are you getting me?

15
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.940 line:82%
This Life

16
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.690 line:82%
Shows us a lot of things

17
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520 line:82%
In our hazy dreamy world

18
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.100 line:82%
This Life

19
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.810 line:82%
Takes us to various destinations

20
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.980 line:82%
In search of an unknown desire

21
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.310 line:82%
What do we want?

22
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.850 line:82%
Think of your destination

23
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.730 line:82%
Heart is adamant

24
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.850 line:82%
It does not listen to explanations

25
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.770 line:82%
Heart wants to

26
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.650 line:82%
Get to the stars

27
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.150 line:82%
It wants to

28
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.520 line:82%
Get them all

29
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.690 line:82%
This life also

30
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.480 line:82%
Speaks about a lot of things

31
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.270 line:82%
In a simple speech

32
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.770 line:82%
Why does life

33
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.560 line:82%
See dreams every night

34
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.600 line:82%
On every lonely night

35
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.600 line:82%
There are desire in dreams

36
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.270 line:82%
Ask your heart what is that desire

37
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.400 line:82%
Is it easy or tough

38
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.400 line:82%
Listen to your heart which says

39
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.350 line:82%
It has to touch

40
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.100 line:82%
All the stars

41
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.150 line:82%
It wants

42
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.150 line:82%
All of them

43
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.980 line:82%
Those who have dreams in their eyes

44
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.940 line:82%
Walk with care

45
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.980 line:82%
Do not mind even if you fall

46
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.440 line:82%
And your dreams shatter and tears flow

47
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.440 line:82%
Those who have dreams in their eyes
Ask them

48
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.440 line:82%
Walk with care

49
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.940 line:82%
Do not mind even if you fall

50
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.020 line:82%
That your dreams shatter and tears flow
Out of your eyes

51
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.900 line:82%
Those who have dreams

52
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.940 line:82%
In their eyes, walk with care

53
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.150 line:82%
Don't mind even if you fall

54
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.020 line:82%
That your dreams shatter and tears flow
Out of your eyes

55
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.480 line:82%
Those who have dreams in their eyes

56
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.650 line:82%
Ask them to walk with care

57
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.480 line:82%
Don't mind

58
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.900 line:82%
Even if you fall
And your dreams shatter

59
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.350 line:82%
And tears flow out of your eyes

60
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.730 line:82%
Those who have dreams in their eyes
Tell them walk with care

61
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.810 line:82%
Kamla Devi!

62
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.560 line:82%
Stop!

63
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.270 line:82%
Where is Rupa?

64
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.810 line:82%
Rupa has gone far away, Mr. Amir.

65
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.310 line:82%
You forget her like she was a dream.

66
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.900 line:82%
Everyone dreams, kamla Devi.

67
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.730 line:82%
But only those dreams come true,

68
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.270 line:82%
which humans don't want to forget
even after many tries.

69
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.770 line:82%
Rupa is not my dream,

70
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.940 line:82%
she is my reality,

71
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.850 line:82%
tell her.

72
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.900 line:82%
And cut!

73
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.650 line:82%
-How was it?
-It was good,

74
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.060 line:82%
That hat was a very good touch.

75
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.900 line:82%
Certainly wasn't expecting that.

76
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.190 line:82%
Lunch, half an hour.

77
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.600 line:82%
Punit! How was my shot?

78
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.400 line:82%
Come back after half an hour.

79
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.480 line:82%
I hesitated at one point in the middle.

80
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.810 line:82%
I almost follow Rupa.

81
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.650 line:82%
I notice that, but I think
that's a long shot we can...

82
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.520 line:82%
I was not going to do a four scene role.

83
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.150 line:82%
Raju said you have two scenes
with Amir khan,

84
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.190 line:82%
then I said fine.

85
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.900 line:82%
When will your Chaudhry sir's
movie start?

86
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.900 line:82%
By the end of the year.

87
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.600 line:82%
I can't eat standing, come on,
let's sit there.

88
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.440 line:82%
She only has one dialog.

89
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.900 line:82%
Wonder if she's fooling Chaudhry
or Chaudhry's fooling her.

90
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.690 line:82%
I wish you had refused when we met,

91
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.730 line:82%
it didn't happen.

92
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.900 line:82%
You showed me beautiful dreams,

93
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.520 line:82%
and I took your hand in mine,

94
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.190 line:82%
and moved on.

95
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.190 line:82%
Enough! Stop it!

96
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.940 line:82%
What are you doing?

97
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.520 line:82%
She is your lover, she broke your heart.

98
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.850 line:82%
How many times do I have to tell you
to feel it?

99
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.770 line:82%
Feel.

100
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.310 line:82%
Who is an actor?

101
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.520 line:82%
An actor adopts his character completely.

102
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.520 line:82%
What is this beautiful dream?

103
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.350 line:82%
Say it as beautiful dream.

104
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.230 line:82%
Action.

105
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.980 line:82%
I wish you had refused when we met,

106
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.270 line:82%
but it didn't happen.

107
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.650 line:82%
You showed me beautiful dreams.

108
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.190 line:82%
And I kept moving holding your hands.

109
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.520 line:82%
Kept moving.

110
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.650 line:82%
When I opened my eyes,

111
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.770 line:82%
I realized that this sweet voice
is a hoax.

112
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.600 line:82%
And these beautiful eyes,

113
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.560 line:82%
were deceiving me.

114
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.980 line:82%
Not bad.

115
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.020 line:82%
But, Vikram, you,

116
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.020 line:82%
you kind of under play it.

117
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.850 line:82%
We need projection in commercial cinema,

118
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.810 line:82%
Energy.

119
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.440 line:82%
Wish...

120
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.520 line:82%
you had refused before meeting.

121
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.900 line:82%
In Hollywood, it's easy to become hero.

122
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.560 line:82%
But in Hindi movies, it's very hard.

123
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.900 line:82%
Hindi movie heroes don't just act,

124
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.940 line:82%
but they sing,

125
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.310 line:82%
dance,

126
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.020 line:82%
does comedy, action.

127
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.900 line:82%
Brother!

128
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.190 line:82%
You need many qualities to become a hero
in a Hindi movie.

129
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.440 line:82%
And for a heroine, sir?

130
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.850 line:82%
Honey! You require the same amount
of hard work.

131
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.650 line:82%
From tomorrow, your training starts.

132
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.020 line:82%
Beware baby, you better run for cover

133
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.900 line:82%
Here I come

134
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.810 line:82%
Beware baby, you better run for cover

135
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.810 line:82%
Here I come

136
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.810 line:82%
I am the lover of beautiful a body
I am the enemy of beautiful a body

137
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.020 line:82%
My style is very different
Compared to the others

138
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.350 line:82%
Beware baby, you better run for cover

139
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.900 line:82%
Here I come

140
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.060 line:82%
Beware baby, you better run for cover

141
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.940 line:82%
Here I come

142
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.020 line:82%
I am the lover of a beautiful a body
I am the enemy of a beautiful a body

143
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.270 line:82%
My style is very different
Compared to the others

144
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.600 line:82%
Today is your last day,

145
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.770 line:82%
in Nandkishore School of Acting.

146
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.060 line:82%
All the best.

147
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.690 line:82%
Look, whatever is within the limits
of my acting knowledge,

148
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:44.810 line:82%
I have given you.

149
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.770 line:82%
But acting is a sea,

150
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.850 line:82%
where you can go as deep as you want.

151
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.480 line:82%
-Mr. Mac, am I correct?
-Yes.

152
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.440 line:82%
But, don't forget one thing,

153
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.310 line:82%
luck plays an important factor along
with the talent.

154
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.730 line:82%
i think the key is

155
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.190 line:82%
that you have to be

156
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.650 line:82%
at the right time at the right place.

157
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.850 line:82%
Sir, am I right?

158
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.480 line:82%
I'm thankful to Mr. Mac,

159
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.230 line:82%
that he came here today,

160
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.310 line:82%
to distribute the certificates.

161
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.350 line:82%
Before he gives certificates,

162
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.650 line:82%
I request him to say something
to the kids.

163
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.400 line:82%
That will be every nice.

164
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.900 line:82%
Please deliver the Sholay dialog, sir.

165
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.270 line:82%
Sholay?

166
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.270 line:82%
The entire fifty thousand.

167
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.770 line:82%
Wow! Wonderful!

168
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.600 line:82%
Hey, Sameer!

169
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.980 line:82%
-Did you talk to Mahesh for me?
-No.

170
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.270 line:82%
All the films are under production.

171
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.600 line:82%
Nothing right now.

172
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.770 line:82%
Really?

173
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.150 line:82%
Abhi, please get my Internet
connection done.

174
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.020 line:82%
I'm not your wife, dude.

175
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:14.900 line:82%
Bye, darling.

176
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.900 line:82%
See you, brother.

177
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.100 line:82%
Why do you speak rubbish?

178
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.400 line:82%
He won't do anything.

179
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.350 line:82%
He is an assistant of Mukesh Bhatt.

180
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.600 line:82%
He gives new actors a break.

181
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.270 line:82%
Yes, is he going to give you a break
or look for his chances of direction?

182
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.270 line:82%
He has some problem with you.

183
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.100 line:82%
Me?

184
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.980 line:82%
-Why?
-Like this.

185
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.270 line:82%
You give photographs in offices.

186
00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.400 line:82%
And do theater in free time.

187
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.270 line:82%
Theater makes an actor live.

188
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.650 line:82%
But the person who sees it,
becomes impossible for them to live.

189
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.230 line:82%
Hey, Sona!

190
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.560 line:82%
Where are you these days?

191
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.020 line:82%
Here.

192
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.270 line:82%
Yesterday I saw you in a TV series.

193
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.310 line:82%
The scene with your father Abhimany Gupta
was wonderful.

194
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.350 line:82%
Thank you.

195
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.150 line:82%
He is Vikram.

196
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.520 line:82%
-Hi
-Hi.

197
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.020 line:82%
From Delhi, to become something
in the industry.

198
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.230 line:82%
You are in queue.

199
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.650 line:82%
All the best.

200
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.810 line:82%
Who is she?

201
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.480 line:82%
Sona, my neighbor.

202
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.310 line:82%
After the hit film
Anjana,

203
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.940 line:82%
film producer Mr. Rolly is now busy
with his new film
Dil Ki Aag.

204
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.520 line:82%
The director of this film is none other
than Rolly's younger brother Ranjit Rolly.

205
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.770 line:82%
Ranjit has not shown any special skills
in acting,

206
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.480 line:82%
let's see how good his direction is.

207
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.020 line:82%
Let me take you to the welcome party
of the film Dil Ki Aag.

208
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.810 line:82%
Like the director, the film's heroine
is also new.

209
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.270 line:82%
Seventies superstar Neena's daughter
Nikki Walia.

210
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.690 line:82%
And like always, Romy Rolly Production's
hero is, Zaffar Khan.

211
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.440 line:82%
You guessed it right, Zaffar Khan.

212
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.600 line:82%
I have left everything for you, Rahul,

213
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.440 line:82%
promise that you will never leave me.

214
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.850 line:82%
The moon and its brightness
can fall apart,

215
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.350 line:82%
a flower and its essence too can fall
apart,

216
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.060 line:82%
but we...

217
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.850 line:82%
will never be apart, Priya.

218
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:15.810 line:82%
-Never.
-Rahul.

219
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:21.900 line:82%
Cut it.

220
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.060 line:82%
Actually, one day, Mrs.
I mean, Mrs. Rolly told me

221
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:31.770 line:82%
you become a director.

222
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.560 line:82%
-You are a director.
-Sir Rolly is unique.

223
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.270 line:82%
I've always said that he's...
He's just been like a father to me.

224
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.400 line:82%
I can't imagine a movie without Zaffar,

225
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.600 line:82%
I won't understand it.

226
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.810 line:82%
Business is not everything,

227
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.310 line:82%
emotions also matter.

228
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.480 line:82%
Actually, I never thought I'll become
a heroine...

229
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.560 line:82%
I wanted to be a vet.

230
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.690 line:82%
Animal's doctor.

231
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.650 line:82%
I just want to say,

232
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.350 line:82%
as much love you have given me,

233
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.600 line:82%
give it to my daughter Nikki too.

234
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.730 line:82%
When my mom told me,
Uncle Romy wants to sign me,

235
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.020 line:82%
I said, "What are you saying?"

236
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.900 line:82%
I was so nervous.

237
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.400 line:82%
But then I said, why not?

238
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.060 line:82%
"I said, why not?"

239
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.230 line:82%
On Tuesday and Friday,
wear it on this finger.

240
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.100 line:82%
And, this Pearl, this is permanent,

241
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.730 line:82%
it will keep your mind cool.

242
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.060 line:82%
Okay.

243
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.230 line:82%
Priest, he always says okay,

244
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.060 line:82%
but only listens to the heart.

245
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.060 line:82%
How many times have I told him

246
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.650 line:82%
five is your lucky number.

247
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.520 line:82%
Start your movie on the 5th.

248
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.440 line:82%
You're talking like a child.

249
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.270 line:82%
On the 5th, Zaffar was shooting
for Mani Ratnam, how could he leave that?

250
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.440 line:82%
Only I know how much Zaffar compromised
to give me the date on 9th.

251
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.600 line:82%
Menty! He doesn't do that for anyone.

252
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:57.850 line:82%
That is right.

253
00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.900 line:82%
Zaffar respects you a lot.

254
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.310 line:82%
After all...

255
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.230 line:82%
I understand the song's situation,

256
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.940 line:82%
but the heroine's sister died
before two scenes,

257
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.900 line:82%
how will she dance with me?

258
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.190 line:82%
I have put my entire
emotion in the death scene,

259
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.560 line:82%
if we show any more crying the picture
becomes dull.

260
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.350 line:82%
We have to move
from highlight to highlight.

261
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.730 line:82%
But there in no logic.

262
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.230 line:82%
Zaffar!

263
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.400 line:82%
If we look for so much logic, we can't
make a commercial film,

264
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.350 line:82%
and I am still justifying the song.

265
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.810 line:82%
The dead sister's friend takes the heroine
to a nightclub,

266
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.230 line:82%
and when the music starts, I'll show
that the heroine has gone into a dream,

267
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.650 line:82%
anything can happen in imagination.

268
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.560 line:82%
Ya.

269
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.350 line:82%
Zaffar, just relax.

270
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.020 line:82%
Trust me.

271
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.480 line:82%
You come and check the set out.

272
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:52.650 line:82%
Really?

273
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.480 line:82%
And I'm treating the whole song
like a musical broadway.

274
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.980 line:82%
Okay, cool. I'll see you on set

275
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.400 line:82%
-Okay.
-All right.

276
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.850 line:82%
-Take your time. Okay.
-All right.

277
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.940 line:82%
My thinking cap.

278
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:17.940 line:82%
He is an ass.

279
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.100 line:82%
Man, he is teaching me! You're an actor,
you just do your work.

280
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.270 line:82%
I was also an actor once.

281
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.980 line:82%
Has the lighting been done?

282
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.650 line:82%
Hope the camera man is taking
the footage.

283
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.020 line:82%
You've become a star.

284
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.310 line:82%
Yes, shooting has been stopped
because to me.

285
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.400 line:82%
-Make up room?
-Back side.

286
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.690 line:82%
Ask for the costume
of the dead sis's friend.

287
00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.690 line:82%
Doesn't she have any name?

288
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.150 line:82%
-Alka.
-Then use the character's name

289
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.400 line:82%
Yes, madam.

290
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:49.850 line:82%
Alka's costume.

291
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.190 line:82%
One minute.

292
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.100 line:82%
Take this.

293
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.690 line:82%
Is there another color?

294
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.230 line:82%
I got this.

295
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.850 line:82%
You're looking very pretty.

296
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.440 line:82%
Really?

297
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.900 line:82%
Ratna, put some eyeliner on.

298
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.770 line:82%
Come in.

299
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.150 line:82%
Good morning, Neena.

300
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.690 line:82%
Good morning, Romy.

301
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.850 line:82%
God bless.

302
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.900 line:82%
She looks so pretty.

303
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.900 line:82%
God bless. Touch wood!

304
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.190 line:82%
Nikki, get your blessings.

305
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:31.730 line:82%
No!

306
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:36.770 line:82%
Are you crying?

307
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.400 line:82%
Mr. Romy!

308
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.190 line:82%
I have become emotional.

309
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.350 line:82%
Emotionally choked.

310
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.520 line:82%
-I want to talk to you.
-Your vanity van is coming.

311
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.900 line:82%
Thank you.

312
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.560 line:82%
I just want to say,
have you seen these costumes?

313
00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.980 line:82%
I mean, we need more options.

314
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.730 line:82%
or... Look at those shoes and bags,
I mean,

315
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.060 line:82%
Order from Gucci or Versace...

316
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.350 line:82%
It's Nikki's first film.

317
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.440 line:82%
-Correct.
-I want the world for her.

318
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.730 line:82%
I like your involvement.
I want your involvement.

319
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.690 line:82%
-But you alway have it.
-Yes, of course.

320
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.230 line:82%
You've made many costumes,

321
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.350 line:82%
why does Neena still talk nonsense?

322
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.600 line:82%
You know the lady, sir.

323
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.520 line:82%
She will double your costume budget.

324
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:19.690 line:82%
Bloody nonsense!

325
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.730 line:82%
Today's heroines wear short clothes,

326
00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.980 line:82%
how much cloth is required for that?

327
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.060 line:82%
Manish, I know this is all your plan,
I know it very well.

328
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.900 line:82%
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, tow, three, four.

329
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.520 line:82%
What is this?

330
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.480 line:82%
Is it a dance or a parade?

331
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.850 line:82%
Have some grace,

332
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.230 line:82%
come on, let's do it again.

333
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.020 line:82%
First position. Music.

334
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.980 line:82%
This song will be the highlight
of the movie.

335
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.270 line:82%
-You know the dance master.
-Nice meeting you.

336
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.650 line:82%
-So you're the star, huh?
-The superstar.

337
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:20.690 line:82%
Will be.

338
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.770 line:82%
Come, sit. Please sit.

339
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.810 line:82%
We will start the shot
from an empty stage,

340
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.770 line:82%
then we'll make a turn, this is my frame.

341
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.690 line:82%
Dead sister's friend.

342
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.230 line:82%
Trolley...

343
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.440 line:82%
Then I zoom in on the girl.

344
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.650 line:82%
And the music starts.

345
00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:49.770 line:82%
How is this?

346
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.560 line:82%
I knew it'll bloody work!

347
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.470 line:82%
Now the drums will beat
After eating and drinking milk

348
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.970 line:82%
The show master has come
Watch the show

349
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:35.180 line:82%
These moments are colorful, sparkling
Thousand glittering stars twinkling

350
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:42.430 line:82%
Bodies are now in a frenzy, are flexible
How can someone not lose his heart to this

351
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.510 line:82%
I lost my body, lost my mind, that's what
The world has lost, my consciousness

352
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.300 line:82%
I lost everything, I have now lost, crazy

353
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.470 line:82%
I have gone crazy

354
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.510 line:82%
Come listen to this tune and rhythm
Go ahead make miracles happen

355
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.430 line:82%
Go crazy

356
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:06.850 line:82%
Friends!

357
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.430 line:82%
Someone spits fire

358
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.100 line:82%
Someone walks on a rope

359
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.890 line:82%
Someone throws up the ball

360
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.890 line:82%
Someone carries the weight

361
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.760 line:82%
Some see, brother someone's twirling
The bansar wheels

362
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.140 line:82%
Someone jumps from high above

363
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:32.260 line:82%
Feet are up and head's down

364
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:39.180 line:82%
I lost my body, mind, world
Consciousness, energy, everything

365
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.640 line:82%
Lost right now

366
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.850 line:82%
Crazy

367
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.430 line:82%
Come listen to this tune and rhythm
Go ahead and make miracles happen

368
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.550 line:82%
Gone crazy

369
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.100 line:82%
Friends!

370
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.550 line:82%
Hit it!

371
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.180 line:82%
Hit it!

372
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.010 line:82%
Hit it!

373
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.260 line:82%
It has come along with colors
A tune it has brought along, this evening

374
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.600 line:82%
On my lips, today, there's only your name

375
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.640 line:82%
I drink wine from your eyes to my eyes

376
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.930 line:82%
My job is I will die for you
Erase myself for you

377
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.050 line:82%
I find you lovely

378
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.760 line:82%
I find you to be mine

379
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.640 line:82%
I find you friendly

380
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.470 line:82%
I find you to be my beloved

381
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.970 line:82%
Your eyes are sharp, my heart leaps

382
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.050 line:82%
Now I sing only your praises

383
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.010 line:82%
I lost my heart, what's left to lose

384
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.220 line:82%
What do I tell you, that I've gone through

385
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.930 line:82%
I lost my body, mind, consciousness

386
00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.970 line:82%
I also lost my energy, everything
I have now lost

387
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.640 line:82%
Gone crazy

388
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.510 line:82%
Gone crazy

389
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.600 line:82%
Come listen to this tune and rhythm

390
00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.720 line:82%
Go ahead and make miracles happen

391
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.720 line:82%
Crazy

392
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.680 line:82%
-Be fast.
-This Zaffar is amazing.

393
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.220 line:82%
He is best.

394
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.600 line:82%
Have you noticed one thing?

395
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.760 line:82%
Chitra is the dance director,

396
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.300 line:82%
but he has been asking me for steps.

397
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:27.930 line:82%
Did you notice it?

398
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.260 line:82%
Yes, I did.

399
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:31.930 line:82%
Now every actor will start asking me

400
00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.300 line:82%
to show them some steps.

401
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.550 line:82%
This year I'll become a dance director.

402
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.010 line:82%
Enough of being an assistant.

403
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.140 line:82%
Who will give you chance?

404
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.430 line:82%
Why? I'll get myself a place somewhere.

405
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.720 line:82%
You keep waiting for that bastard
Chaudhary's picture.

406
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:54.970 line:82%
Hi, Auntie Mohini.

407
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.850 line:82%
Can you lend me 500 bucks?

408
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.430 line:82%
I'll return it day after tomorrow.

409
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.100 line:82%
Surely you will return, son.

410
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.760 line:82%
Do you know what you are doing?

411
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.260 line:82%
In Delhi, your father has a big store,

412
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.970 line:82%
go and help him.

413
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.550 line:82%
You are wasting time.

414
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:16.970 line:82%
I read,

415
00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.970 line:82%
that either the producer makes his own
son a hero,

416
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.760 line:82%
or a hero's son.

417
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.180 line:82%
Who gives work to outsiders?

418
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.140 line:82%
I don't have any problem with your stay,

419
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.640 line:82%
but I should know
as long as you're here.

420
00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.350 line:82%
I'll take a message.
Yeah, all right. Thank you.

421
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.510 line:82%
Yes?

422
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:02.850 line:82%
Hi.

423
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.050 line:82%
-Is Ramesh Chaurani available?
-You?

424
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.430 line:82%
Vikram Jaisingh. I'm an actor.

425
00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.430 line:82%
He is in a story sitting.

426
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.350 line:82%
I just want two minutes.

427
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.010 line:82%
I told you he is busy.

428
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.050 line:82%
I can wait.

429
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.350 line:82%
Okay.

430
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:26.760 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

431
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.050 line:82%
What did she say?

432
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.710 line:82%
She said that, he is busy.

433
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.750 line:82%
Sitting is going on.

434
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.380 line:82%
Give her the photos, he wont meet you.

435
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.750 line:82%
Then why are you waiting?

436
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.250 line:82%
I've an appointment for second lead.

437
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960 line:82%
Second lead?

438
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.340 line:82%
Very good.

439
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.210 line:82%
By the way I am the heroine
for Pinky Production.

440
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.710 line:82%
Pinky Production.

441
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.420 line:82%
Yes, Satish Chaudhary
is a regular producer.

442
00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.090 line:82%
He is making
Love Buds,

443
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.670 line:82%
starring Akshay and Kareena.

444
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.630 line:82%
Then my film.

445
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.920 line:82%
The title is not yet decided.

446
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.380 line:82%
Brother, only ten days is left
for the shooting to be over.

447
00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.340 line:82%
It's a love story,

448
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.420 line:82%
but the picture's mounting.

449
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:40.840 line:82%
When you see the frames, it will
amaze you.

450
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.050 line:82%
We have spent every last bit
on the picture.

451
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.670 line:82%
Due to tension, he is suffering from
high BP.

452
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.840 line:82%
Give some more Vodka.

453
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.210 line:82%
Next project,

454
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.550 line:82%
is amazing.

455
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.840 line:82%
Signed a new director.

456
00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.880 line:82%
Script is really good.

457
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.630 line:82%
This is first half and this second half.

458
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.420 line:82%
That is all fine, who are the actors?

459
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.380 line:82%
John Abraham, Bipasha Basu.

460
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.210 line:82%
And there is a new heroine.

461
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.170 line:82%
Will John and Bipasha act?

462
00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.880 line:82%
I am not a new player.

463
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.920 line:82%
The new director,

464
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.380 line:82%
is John's best friend.

465
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.340 line:82%
Thats why you hired the new director.

466
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.420 line:82%
-It's dashing, sister.
-I know.

467
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800 line:82%
I know.

468
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.880 line:82%
Sister.

469
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:37.130 line:82%
Please ask brother to introduce him
to a corporate company.

470
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.630 line:82%
-He feels shy.
-You leave it to me.

471
00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:46.090 line:82%
I'll ask him to introduce
Satish to a good place.

472
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:48.750 line:82%
Look, Mr. Chaudhary.

473
00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.800 line:82%
If Mr. Romy Rolly is recommending you...

474
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.340 line:82%
we will seriously look into your project.

475
00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.420 line:82%
That's fantastic! Thank you.

476
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.880 line:82%
Brother must have mentioned,

477
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.050 line:82%
that we have spoken with John
and Bipasha...

478
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.630 line:82%
And we're very happy.

479
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:08.500 line:82%
But our basic criteria is property.

480
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.840 line:82%
In Hollywood, a script is called property.

481
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.050 line:82%
Here, property is property.

482
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.300 line:82%
That's funny.
You see, their content is key.

483
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.000 line:82%
We want to bring this culture
into your industry,

484
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.550 line:82%
your mindset...

485
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.800 line:82%
-there must be change.
-Change is coming.

486
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.960 line:82%
We haven't signed John and Bipasha
because they are stars.

487
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:42.880 line:82%
We signed them because the script
demands it.

488
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.630 line:82%
Absolutely.

489
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.420 line:82%
And in second lead, a new girl is required
so we are signing a new girl.

490
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.920 line:82%
I met Ramesh.

491
00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.670 line:82%
Told I loved Sona's test.

492
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.460 line:82%
Not a parallel role.

493
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.340 line:82%
-But the hero's sister role.
-Hero's sister?

494
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.800 line:82%
Yes, I told him we'll tell him later.

495
00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.300 line:82%
Enough of sister's role, Raju, you will
get me typecast.

496
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.550 line:82%
What are you saying?

497
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.130 line:82%
In
Josh,
Aishwarya was Sharukh's sister.

498
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.420 line:82%
So did he get typecast?

499
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.500 line:82%
She is different.

500
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.670 line:82%
You know these love birds have ended.

501
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.550 line:82%
Do you think these small roles are okay
for me?

502
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.840 line:82%
Forget about him.

503
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.920 line:82%
-Take care.
-Okay, thank you.

504
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.300 line:82%
You are waiting here too.

505
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.960 line:82%
No one wants to meet you?

506
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.250 line:82%
No, Abhi said that he'll be at home,

507
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.750 line:82%
he will be back.

508
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.750 line:82%
You can offer me tea while I wait.

509
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.300 line:82%
Where were you hiding?

510
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.840 line:82%
My fridge has broken down.

511
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.710 line:82%
I don't have time to get it fixed.

512
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.590 line:82%
My neighbor Auntie Varma,

513
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.250 line:82%
I keep everything in her fridge.

514
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.460 line:82%
Your neighbor is really nice.

515
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.090 line:82%
She is nice.

516
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.630 line:82%
Charges me for using her fridge.

517
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.170 line:82%
Are you serious?

518
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.210 line:82%
She has to run her house, her husband
was a stunt man.

519
00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.380 line:82%
For a movie, he was shooting a car
scene,

520
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.880 line:82%
and had an accident.

521
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.880 line:82%
He died on the spot. Sugar?

522
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.710 line:82%
One spoon.

523
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.800 line:82%
Thanks.

524
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.380 line:82%
I've been calling the producer for money,
he still hasn't paid me.

525
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.710 line:82%
Where do you stay?

526
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.460 line:82%
I'm... Bandra.

527
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.000 line:82%
Come on.

528
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:58.750 line:82%
Don't know when he will be back.
What's your program?

529
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.050 line:82%
Why?

530
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.050 line:82%
Yo! You know we bring
The buggers in the place

531
00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.880 line:82%
Don't be messing with me
'Cause I'll hit in the face

532
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.300 line:82%
You know, you better salute to the king

533
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.250 line:82%
You know you better bow down
To the same

534
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.130 line:82%
Check that
'Cause we are the greatest

535
00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.500 line:82%
I have worked in two films,
Teer Talvar.

536
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.590 line:82%
But they were released only
in the small cities.

537
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.050 line:82%
And you are sure...

538
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.380 line:82%
Satish Chaudhary will make a hit picture?

539
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.880 line:82%
-Why?
-Because people don't mean it.

540
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:35.960 line:82%
No, Chaudhary will do it for me.

541
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.500 line:82%
You're very lucky, Sona.

542
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.380 line:82%
There is someone in your life.

543
00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.670 line:82%
You must be very special to him.

544
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.210 line:82%
He is married.

545
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.090 line:82%
He has kids as well.

546
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.250 line:82%
He has helped me a lot, so no problem
for him.

547
00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.300 line:82%
Good.

548
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.460 line:82%
Someone once said,

549
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.000 line:82%
a person chooses his own
success and failure.

550
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.630 line:82%
Success and failure
are only choices we make.

551
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.050 line:82%
-Can I ask a question?
-What?

552
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.500 line:82%
Shall we eat some bhelpuri?

553
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.590 line:82%
No.

554
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.000 line:82%
Okay.

555
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.750 line:82%
-Watch this.
-Take that.

556
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.670 line:82%
You are absolutely dead.

557
00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.170 line:82%
-Oh, come on.
-Karan!

558
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.210 line:82%
Hey, long time, man.

559
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.590 line:82%
No, I'm free, tell me.
What? What's up?

560
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.130 line:82%
Of course I know you're starting
your two-hero film,
Koi Aane Wala Hai,

561
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.340 line:82%
with Shah Rukh and Arman.
How can I forget!

562
00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:51.630 line:82%
He what?

563
00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.500 line:82%
He broke his leg?
Arman broke his leg?

564
00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.420 line:82%
My God! That's like sad man.

565
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.500 line:82%
Okay.

566
00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.050 line:82%
And when do you start?

567
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.670 line:82%
Next month. Okay.

568
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.960 line:82%
All right, fine. I'll work it out
and I will call you back.

569
00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.380 line:82%
Yeah? All right. Bye.

570
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.210 line:82%
All decisions are made by Rolly.

571
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.500 line:82%
You need to talk to him.

572
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.420 line:82%
Whatever I say, he has only one thing.

573
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.710 line:82%
Zaffar's first film was with me.

574
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.300 line:82%
Correct.

575
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.960 line:82%
And my last film with him.

576
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.670 line:82%
I'm still paying for it.

577
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.630 line:82%
He never pays full,
yet forces me to attend

578
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.500 line:82%
his niece's birthday
and nephew's wedding.

579
00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.050 line:82%
Above all, Ranjit is the new director.

580
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.840 line:82%
He is crazy.

581
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.960 line:82%
Sona, having fun?

582
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.630 line:82%
Devraj, is your boss still
in the make up room?

583
00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.340 line:82%
Any problem?

584
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.130 line:82%
I think so.

585
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.800 line:82%
Tell me about it.

586
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.340 line:82%
You listened to the script.

587
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.090 line:82%
And you said its fantastic, mind blowing.

588
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.250 line:82%
This is not your reason.

589
00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.460 line:82%
Brother, accept it.

590
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.000 line:82%
It's a full on negative role.

591
00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.340 line:82%
Not negative. Anti-hero.

592
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.960 line:82%
Okay, its an anti-hero role,
and I am ready to portray it.

593
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.750 line:82%
But you are not understanding it.

594
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.380 line:82%
I'm not Zaffar Khan.

595
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.750 line:82%
Zaffar Khan is an image.

596
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.880 line:82%
He's an icon.

597
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.340 line:82%
I work fro Zaffar Khan.

598
00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:40.420 line:82%
He asks if my fans permit me to portray
such a negative role?

599
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:46.670 line:82%
We will change the script,
make the role a positive one.

600
00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.300 line:82%
Solved.

601
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.960 line:82%
Look at this.

602
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.380 line:82%
From this month, my regular column
is published.

603
00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.710 line:82%
Every month?

604
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.460 line:82%
A little bird told me.

605
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.590 line:82%
How is the title?

606
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.340 line:82%
May I give you some news?

607
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.420 line:82%
Don't use my name.

608
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.050 line:82%
Zaffar has some serious problems,

609
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.630 line:82%
with script and the director.

610
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.130 line:82%
How do you know?

611
00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.300 line:82%
Somebody told me.

612
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.000 line:82%
Somebody close to him.

613
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.590 line:82%
I can't say the name.

614
00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:17.960 line:82%
Come on, Sona!

615
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.420 line:82%
I don't believe this.

616
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.840 line:82%
Make it positive.

617
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.750 line:82%
I don't have any problem but Rolly...

618
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.550 line:82%
How can we make it positive?

619
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.460 line:82%
If I have to tell you, why have I hired
you as the writer?

620
00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:39.300 line:82%
I can think, but I wrote as I was told.

621
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.000 line:82%
What?

622
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.420 line:82%
It was a blockbuster in US.

623
00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.550 line:82%
Super hit!

624
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.630 line:82%
But this is India.

625
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.800 line:82%
The audience here is different.

626
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.420 line:82%
This is not because of Zaffar.

627
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.630 line:82%
But I too felt the character should
be a little positive.

628
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.880 line:82%
In the end, the police doesn't catch him.

629
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.050 line:82%
-So?
-Means he is in love, conscience awakens.

630
00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.800 line:82%
We can add a temple scene,

631
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:17.250 line:82%
a monologue in front of mirror.

632
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.840 line:82%
They are old, but when done
with conviction will be a hit.

633
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.590 line:82%
Then cut with an empty frame.

634
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.880 line:82%
A noose on the neck with a big frame.

635
00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.630 line:82%
Then the hero suddenly enters.

636
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.420 line:82%
He sees the noose.

637
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.420 line:82%
The noose is swinging,

638
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.880 line:82%
which is symbolic
and the hero thinks,

639
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.670 line:82%
whether to commit suicide or not.

640
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.920 line:82%
He holds the noose, kisses it
and hangs himself.

641
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.750 line:82%
Institute.

642
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.000 line:82%
I'm not making this for a film festival.

643
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:48.880 line:82%
Only like this...

644
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:50.300 line:82%
loud thinking, sir.

645
00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:52.420 line:82%
Brother.

646
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.920 line:82%
Don't mind it.
I suspect foul play in this.

647
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:05.960 line:82%
What are you buying? You mostly eat
packaged food.

648
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.670 line:82%
Who will cook?

649
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.050 line:82%
You should.

650
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.670 line:82%
Black lentils.

651
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.750 line:82%
Butter chicken.

652
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.130 line:82%
Bread.

653
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.130 line:82%
Remembering home.

654
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960 line:82%
Go back home.

655
00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.000 line:82%
By the way,

656
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.050 line:82%
I make tasty chicken.

657
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.800 line:82%
Should I buy it?

658
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:26.880 line:82%
Where will you keep it?

659
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.750 line:82%
You don't have a fridge now.

660
00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:38.920 line:82%
Want a new fridge?

661
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:43.460 line:82%
-Means?
-You don't need to buy it.

662
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.920 line:82%
Participate in the contest.

663
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:54.050 line:82%
Look here, fill it out and if you win,
the fridge is yours.

664
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:58.500 line:82%
What do you think, if I fill this form out
there is a chance to win a fridge?

665
00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:04.210 line:82%
I think if you don't fill this, then no
chances of the fridge.

666
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.380 line:82%
I am not fluent in English.

667
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.460 line:82%
That's what I'm here for.

668
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.590 line:82%
No frost, no cost.

669
00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:19.340 line:82%
What do you think?

670
00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.590 line:82%
You are smart.

671
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.250 line:82%
So you were shopping with Sona.

672
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.750 line:82%
There is nothing like that.

673
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:32.340 line:82%
It will happen, keep it up.

674
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.250 line:82%
Forget about this, and focus on what you
are here for.

675
00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.420 line:82%
Abhi!

676
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:42.460 line:82%
It's boring.

677
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:43.590 line:82%
Yes. Shravan, speak.

678
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.920 line:82%
-College three...
-No, I'll reach at 6 a.m.

679
00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.130 line:82%
Oh shit!

680
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.130 line:82%
But I...

681
00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.960 line:82%
will call you later.

682
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.130 line:82%
What happened?

683
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.210 line:82%
For the morning shot, we require
a grandfather clock.

684
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.630 line:82%
Imran is going on vacation
and the movie is about to release.

685
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:11.130 line:82%
Mukesh Bhatt will kill me.

686
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.300 line:82%
Where are you going to find
a grandfather clock?

687
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:16.800 line:82%
Visit the thief market.

688
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.380 line:82%
Shops are not open there
early in the morning.

689
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.590 line:82%
Then I don't know,
someone you know must have one.

690
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:24.750 line:82%
Think, come on. Can you think of anyone?

691
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:25.960 line:82%
Anyone?

692
00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:26.920 line:82%
My grandfather?

693
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.880 line:82%
Abhi, shut up. I have no idea
of what to do.

694
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.300 line:82%
Aunt Mohini.

695
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.250 line:82%
You loved me like a mother.

696
00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.460 line:82%
I don't have anything to offer, but I want
to serve you.

697
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:05.250 line:82%
I'm taking your grandfather clock
for polishing.

698
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.550 line:82%
I know its dear to you.

699
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.500 line:82%
Tomorrow, when you get it
after polishing,

700
00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:18.380 line:82%
your happy eyes will make me feel
that I have received your blessings.

701
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.710 line:82%
Your son Vikram.

702
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.550 line:82%
Oh, man.

703
00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.840 line:82%
You are wonderful.

704
00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:36.130 line:82%
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

705
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:38.710 line:82%
Rajan! Take this inside, fast.

706
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:40.050 line:82%
Hiring cost...

707
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.090 line:82%
No cost.

708
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.590 line:82%
Just get it polished.

709
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.960 line:82%
I will get it done now.

710
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.170 line:82%
Come on, I'll introduce you to Imran.

711
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.170 line:82%
He is doing a kissing scene.

712
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.590 line:82%
Bring two cups of tea.

713
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.130 line:82%
With ginger.

714
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:57.920 line:82%
Is Mukesh Bhatt there?

715
00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.960 line:82%
No, he has gone for week.

716
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.380 line:82%
Out of town.

717
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.800 line:82%
What are you doing in the evening?

718
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.170 line:82%
Nothing.

719
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.380 line:82%
Will you come to
Pyar Hua Tumse
premiere?

720
00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.000 line:82%
I have two passes.

721
00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.170 line:82%
Come on.

722
00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.500 line:82%
Looking nice.

723
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:24.420 line:82%
Lets go.

724
00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.210 line:82%
And I've worked with Rani in my career

725
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.000 line:82%
and she's a fantastic actress,
she's a very sweet girl.

726
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:05.000 line:82%
Sometimes the reviews may not be good,
but the audience will like it.

727
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.630 line:82%
What's a reception without an audience?

728
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.250 line:82%
It was a lovely experience.

729
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.380 line:82%
I just loved working with Akshay.

730
00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.050 line:82%
In fact this is the first role
we're doing together.

731
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.250 line:82%
But the experience was lovely.
I had a great time.

732
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:25.090 line:82%
It's Scotch.

733
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.420 line:82%
Of course.

734
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.380 line:82%
Thanks for bringing me here.

735
00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:30.000 line:82%
Any time.

736
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.500 line:82%
Hello.

737
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.960 line:82%
-Hi.
-How are you?

738
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.300 line:82%
-Fine.
-Good to see you.

739
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.420 line:82%
Ma'am, would you like
to have a glass of champagne?

740
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.710 line:82%
Yes, please. Thank you.

741
00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.000 line:82%
Hello.

742
00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:46.250 line:82%
Thank you.

743
00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:50.050 line:82%
Hello.

744
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.710 line:82%
I want to meet Nikki Walia.

745
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:13.880 line:82%
"Hello" again.

746
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:20.380 line:82%
She is with her mom Neena.

747
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.920 line:82%
We'll see.

748
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.550 line:82%
She's so boring.

749
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:37.670 line:82%
Hello, Auntie.

750
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.170 line:82%
Please say something else.

751
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.750 line:82%
So that I can tell my friend that Neena
spoke with me.

752
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.300 line:82%
All the best.

753
00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.090 line:82%
May I tell you a weired thing?

754
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.380 line:82%
In a way,
I'm in this world because of you.

755
00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.300 line:82%
Excuse me?

756
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.420 line:82%
Mom and Dad were in college together.

757
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.380 line:82%
They were your fans
so they became friends.

758
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.800 line:82%
So you see, in a way,
I'm in this world because of you.

759
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.500 line:82%
How sweet.

760
00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:19.090 line:82%
He saw you once at a party long time ago.

761
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.710 line:82%
My dad had said, "You know, Vikram,
she was the most beautiful woman in room."

762
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.710 line:82%
That's kind of him.

763
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:28.210 line:82%
Today I will call him and say...

764
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:30.630 line:82%
She's still the most beautiful woman
in the room.

765
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:33.340 line:82%
Thank you, Vikram.

766
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.000 line:82%
Vikram Jaisingh.

767
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.000 line:82%
My daughter Nikki.

768
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.300 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

769
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.710 line:82%
-Okay then. Bye, ma'am.
-Bye.

770
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.960 line:82%
Todays generation speaks this way.

771
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:54.210 line:82%
No one really feels alive.

772
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.300 line:82%
Trust me, Mom,

773
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.000 line:82%
you're still alive.

774
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:03.420 line:82%
You know my relationship with Zaffar.

775
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:05.550 line:82%
-He is my kid.
-I know that.

776
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:08.250 line:82%
I heard from a reliable source.

777
00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:13.380 line:82%
He has given all your dates
to Karan Johar.

778
00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:15.420 line:82%
Serious?

779
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:17.000 line:82%
I just want you to know.

780
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:18.710 line:82%
Will I lie to you?

781
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:20.880 line:82%
I'm waiting for him in the office.

782
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.630 line:82%
-Where are you and Zaffar? Shut up!
-No, sir. I have no idea where is he?

783
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.090 line:82%
I don't know where he is.

784
00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.210 line:82%
If you don't know, who will know?

785
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.670 line:82%
Ask Zaffar's mom, and call me immediately,
you bloody idiot!

786
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.800 line:82%
Are you wearing a pearl ring?

787
00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.380 line:82%
Why are you getting upset during
lunch time?

788
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.380 line:82%
Come and eat.

789
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.090 line:82%
I have lost my faith in this industry.

790
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:54.590 line:82%
Romy!

791
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.250 line:82%
Don't be like that.

792
00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.250 line:82%
You know this industry,

793
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.300 line:82%
don't feel bad for it so much.

794
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:03.670 line:82%
How?

795
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.340 line:82%
He is not responding to my calls or texts.

796
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.630 line:82%
This is too much.

797
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:12.800 line:82%
Is this how he behaves?

798
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.090 line:82%
Todays generation don't know
how to behave.

799
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.500 line:82%
There was a time when it was fun to film.

800
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:31.960 line:82%
No enjoyable anymore.

801
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.800 line:82%
Have to run for dates behind people who
are like my children.

802
00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:39.710 line:82%
Does it feel good?

803
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.460 line:82%
I don't have any reputation now.

804
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:47.670 line:82%
Don't talk like this.

805
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:54.590 line:82%
Everyone respects you and you
have a reputation.

806
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:56.630 line:82%
Right.

807
00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:00.000 line:82%
You have a lot of respect.

808
00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:16.250 line:82%
Everyone left.

809
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:20.840 line:82%
Only these four walls,

810
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:24.800 line:82%
in deep horrifying silence, asks me,

811
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.670 line:82%
"Devdutt,

812
00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.500 line:82%
what will you choose between principle
and convenience?

813
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.300 line:82%
What are you thinking?

814
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.340 line:82%
In every path of yours,
there is a diversion.

815
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:45.800 line:82%
You are a human and its your destiny.

816
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.880 line:82%
Diversions.

817
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:50.550 line:82%
Only diversions.

818
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:53.670 line:82%
Only diversions."

819
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:01.500 line:82%
-Abhi is talented.
-Yes.

820
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:03.710 line:82%
And also hardworking.

821
00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.880 line:82%
He has been rehearsing the same play
for two months.

822
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.460 line:82%
Everyday.

823
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:12.840 line:82%
He will get his break.

824
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.800 line:82%
I hope so.

825
00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:20.960 line:82%
Why are you talking like this?

826
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:24.750 line:82%
He's content.

827
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.840 line:82%
There is no fire in it.

828
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:32.880 line:82%
Do you have?

829
00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.710 line:82%
You're done?

830
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.000 line:82%
One minute.

831
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.460 line:82%
Eyelash.

832
00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:47.050 line:82%
I don't want it.

833
00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.050 line:82%
Why? Don't you want to make a wish?

834
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:52.170 line:82%
I don't need it.

835
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.920 line:82%
Confidence.

836
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.380 line:82%
Now this eyelash flying in the air,

837
00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:12.710 line:82%
will take your wish and land slowly...

838
00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.130 line:82%
into an open gutter, which is waiting
for it.

839
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.500 line:82%
Shut up!

840
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:09.920 line:82%
Mr. Rolly, I am so sorry.

841
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.170 line:82%
My sister in Chicago,

842
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.420 line:82%
something happened to her family...

843
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.340 line:82%
Now everything is fine, right?

844
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.590 line:82%
Yes, fine, but also not.

845
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.170 line:82%
I was thinking...

846
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.920 line:82%
Sugar?

847
00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:35.840 line:82%
I'm on diet.

848
00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.840 line:82%
I was thinking...

849
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.920 line:82%
I haven't taken a break since three years.

850
00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.050 line:82%
You are working really hard.

851
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.130 line:82%
God has blessings on you. Yes,

852
00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.750 line:82%
But how long it will last.

853
00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.920 line:82%
Means... I am working
like a machine.

854
00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.420 line:82%
I'm being mechanical.

855
00:56:56.340 --> 00:57:00.420 line:82%
Even if you work bad, it is still better
compared to the others.

856
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.300 line:82%
You're like a father to me.

857
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:12.750 line:82%
God bless.

858
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:15.300 line:82%
I need a favor.

859
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.090 line:82%
Say it, son.

860
00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.590 line:82%
Let me go from this film.

861
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.340 line:82%
What are you saying?

862
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:31.250 line:82%
You don't want to work with me
in my film.

863
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:33.210 line:82%
Can I think like that?

864
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.550 line:82%
Our relationship is not
because of a film.

865
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:41.050 line:82%
We will do ten films.

866
00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:44.670 line:82%
But, Romy, I really, really need a break.

867
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.800 line:82%
Whatever losses you have...

868
00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.210 line:82%
I'm genuinely sorry, I actually want to...

869
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.630 line:82%
Let it go.

870
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.710 line:82%
He should have thought about it.

871
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:05.460 line:82%
My daughter's future is involved.

872
00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:08.210 line:82%
What do I tell you, he told me,

873
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.590 line:82%
"Heroine is everything in the movie,
what am I doing?"

874
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.300 line:82%
I said, "You may be a big star.

875
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.960 line:82%
But this script is mine

876
00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:18.800 line:82%
it will remain like this."

877
00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:21.710 line:82%
He said, "It's difficult for me."

878
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.210 line:82%
I said, you're most welcome to go.

879
00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.590 line:82%
Now who's going to be the hero?

880
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.960 line:82%
Don't you worry, Neena.

881
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.630 line:82%
EVERYBODY WANTS TO WORK IN ROLLYWOOD.

882
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.460 line:82%
Zaffar was doing this film previously?

883
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:55.050 line:82%
I have done three dramatic
films continuously.

884
00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:56.170 line:82%
One after the other.

885
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.380 line:82%
I can't give you
an excuse about availability.

886
00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.250 line:82%
Come on, Uncle Romy.
You are making me ashamed.

887
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.130 line:82%
Hey, Uncle Romy, I was just feeling that

888
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:06.710 line:82%
If I act in this role,

889
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.500 line:82%
there will be some controversy,
don't you think?

890
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:15.050 line:82%
I'm really looking forward
to doing something light right now.

891
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:16.670 line:82%
I want to do different.

892
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.750 line:82%
Something experimental, you know?

893
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:23.750 line:82%
Uncle Romy, you're like a father to me.

894
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:27.250 line:82%
By the way, Dad was asking about you.
He said to say hi.

895
00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:31.800 line:82%
You understand, right?

896
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:33.300 line:82%
Like in...

897
00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.380 line:82%
You will get dates in 2015.

898
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:38.750 line:82%
-Ready?
-Ya.

899
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.840 line:82%
My shot's ready, I'll be back.

900
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:45.590 line:82%
No.

901
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:48.380 line:82%
Sorry.

902
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.550 line:82%
You said, "Content is king,

903
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.170 line:82%
script is property."

904
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.170 line:82%
Industry's culture should change.

905
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:58.170 line:82%
And now you want me to suggest
who'll be the hero?

906
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:02.170 line:82%
What can we do. We are answerable
to our shareholders.

907
01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:03.670 line:82%
Sir, we were thinking that

908
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:05.800 line:82%
We should start Mr. Chaudhary's project.

909
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:08.210 line:82%
After all you recommended him.

910
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.800 line:82%
You are not starting my project.

911
01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.300 line:82%
Meet him he is Mr. Dinal my old...

912
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:19.550 line:82%
What can I say?

913
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.340 line:82%
I am thankful.

914
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.630 line:82%
I won't tell the length of our
relationship.

915
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:27.460 line:82%
Else you will know my age.

916
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.420 line:82%
You still look young, Neena.

917
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.050 line:82%
-You're such a charming guy.
-Oh, stop it.

918
01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.840 line:82%
Wow!

919
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.750 line:82%
He was sad when he heard about the film.

920
01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.920 line:82%
And he said, on his own,

921
01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.920 line:82%
"I'll be the financier of film."

922
01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:46.170 line:82%
Really?

923
01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.500 line:82%
Okay, listen Mr. Rolly.

924
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:50.960 line:82%
Rolly, sir.

925
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.750 line:82%
Sure.

926
01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.920 line:82%
Except for Neena,
I have no connection in film industry

927
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000 line:82%
except that my grandfather
and Soda Modi

928
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:01.710 line:82%
Wow!

929
01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:03.420 line:82%
-Very good.
-I'm a shipping man.

930
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.630 line:82%
I'll sign an agreement.

931
01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.300 line:82%
But, father, I am no where into it.

932
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:10.090 line:82%
But,

933
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.750 line:82%
Neena's the boss.

934
01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.210 line:82%
Neena's the boss.

935
01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:18.420 line:82%
Look at that!

936
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:20.630 line:82%
Romy.

937
01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:22.420 line:82%
What about the hero?

938
01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.960 line:82%
Neena, I was thinking...

939
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:32.500 line:82%
and realized that Zaffar not doing
this picture is a blessing in disguise.

940
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:36.380 line:82%
This role demands new face.

941
01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.550 line:82%
New face?

942
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.000 line:82%
If I get this role for free,

943
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:44.130 line:82%
I won't say no. New face.

944
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.170 line:82%
It would be good if there was a star.

945
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.300 line:82%
This new face? I don't know.

946
01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.750 line:82%
Dharam has two sons?

947
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.380 line:82%
Bobby and Sunny?

948
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.420 line:82%
Pinky, please.

949
01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.670 line:82%
You should have told Dharam, another
son is required before 20 years.

950
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.300 line:82%
He would never say no.

951
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.800 line:82%
You guys make jokes about my sister.

952
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.550 line:82%
She is such a genius, what can we do.

953
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:09.500 line:82%
Too much. Stop it.

954
01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.710 line:82%
Why don't you guys suggest something?

955
01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.840 line:82%
Congratulations! I just read it.

956
01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:18.130 line:82%
What?

957
01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.670 line:82%
Announcement about John and Bipasha.

958
01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.550 line:82%
Yes, it came in newspaper.

959
01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:26.250 line:82%
Now introduce me to the director.

960
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.800 line:82%
-Tomorrow I'm in Filimistaan for shoot.
-Okay.

961
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.380 line:82%
Come at 2:00 or 2:30 pm.

962
01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.380 line:82%
Okay. Done.

963
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.170 line:82%
My movie is starting.

964
01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.920 line:82%
-What? Wow!
-Congratulations!

965
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.050 line:82%
Thank you!

966
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.420 line:82%
Come, have a drink.

967
01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.550 line:82%
Oh, man!

968
01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:01.500 line:82%
Very good.

969
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.050 line:82%
Who is the photographer?

970
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:05.050 line:82%
Abhit.

971
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:16.250 line:82%
Why?

972
01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.210 line:82%
Why are you asking?

973
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.210 line:82%
What's this?

974
01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.750 line:82%
Means?

975
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:35.960 line:82%
All angles, with emotions,
and straight photos.

976
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.090 line:82%
Anyone might like it.

977
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:40.710 line:82%
Very good.

978
01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:47.500 line:82%
You don't get a break due to these photos
or parties.

979
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:52.380 line:82%
Abhi, you speak nonsense.

980
01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.630 line:82%
You're feeling sad because your friend
is taking me to parties.

981
01:03:58.090 --> 01:03:59.460 line:82%
Don't don't throw it out on my photos.

982
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:03.340 line:82%
I am not sowing my anger,
but advising you.

983
01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.090 line:82%
You won't become an actor
with poses.

984
01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.880 line:82%
This is not the way.

985
01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.380 line:82%
Abhi!

986
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.250 line:82%
Really? Do you know the way?

987
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:15.670 line:82%
Then tell me, why are you here?

988
01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.460 line:82%
What are you saying?

989
01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.670 line:82%
Who says I'm here?

990
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.300 line:82%
I am doing two shows on TV
and have a reputation in theater.

991
01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:29.630 line:82%
By the way, I don't borrow money
from friends or ask my parents for any.

992
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.250 line:82%
Abhi, I will return your money
but today you showed me your true colors.

993
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.550 line:82%
If identity has then hear the truth.

994
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.750 line:82%
-Guys, please stop it.
-No, don't get involved, Sameer.

995
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.670 line:82%
You're wasting your time, Vikram Jaisingh.

996
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.090 line:82%
You are not an actor and wont become one.

997
01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.590 line:82%
Go and sit in your father's shop at Delhi.

998
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:56.420 line:82%
Guys, what are you doing? Vikram!

999
01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.920 line:82%
Vikram.

1000
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.170 line:82%
One minute, where are you going?

1001
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:06.880 line:82%
What is he saying?

1002
01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:09.420 line:82%
He moved idols in Delhi,

1003
01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.670 line:82%
Abhi borrowed money and
watched movies with me.

1004
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.420 line:82%
Why are you getting hurt?

1005
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.000 line:82%
-How can he behave like this?
-Let it go.

1006
01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:18.130 line:82%
He is drunk.

1007
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.960 line:82%
What if he is drunk?
He's my friend!

1008
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.920 line:82%
He is saying I'm nothing.

1009
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:26.630 line:82%
I should go back to Delhi!

1010
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:46.210 line:82%
You don't have to go anywhere.

1011
01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.000 line:82%
I loved your photos.

1012
01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:55.000 line:82%
You have what is required.

1013
01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:58.250 line:82%
Look at me!

1014
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.250 line:82%
I had to wait,

1015
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.380 line:82%
but if I'm getting a big break who's there
to stop me?

1016
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.050 line:82%
Right?

1017
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:11.420 line:82%
You know you're good.

1018
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:14.170 line:82%
You know it.

1019
01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:28.590 line:82%
Sona, you were sound asleep
so I didn't wake you up.

1020
01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.170 line:82%
I could not congratulate you
last night.

1021
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.670 line:82%
So giving it now.

1022
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:37.130 line:82%
I wish your movie becomes a super hit.

1023
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.880 line:82%
I love you. Vikram.

1024
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:50.250 line:82%
The sun is peeping through my window

1025
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.750 line:82%
Like rays have got their path

1026
01:07:55.630 --> 01:08:00.090 line:82%
They have come smiling

1027
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.340 line:82%
Sleep in my room has vanished

1028
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:13.210 line:82%
Hope has taken a U-turn

1029
01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:18.460 line:82%
It has come back here again

1030
01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:25.130 line:82%
Lets move forward

1031
01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:27.840 line:82%
With this which

1032
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.630 line:82%
Is new

1033
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.250 line:82%
I have lost my heart somewhere

1034
01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:40.130 line:82%
What has happened today

1035
01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:54.960 line:82%
The tune is changing

1036
01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.250 line:82%
Life is going to settle

1037
01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.750 line:82%
Don't know why I felt that way

1038
01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:04.050 line:82%
A heart shaped branch hangs

1039
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.300 line:82%
Flowers are about to blossom

1040
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.210 line:82%
Birds slowly come near to sing

1041
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.550 line:82%
It's very good.

1042
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.960 line:82%
Where do they come from?

1043
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.000 line:82%
Give me one.

1044
01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:20.090 line:82%
Shut up! Shameless.

1045
01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:25.210 line:82%
Give it back fast.

1046
01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:27.130 line:82%
I'll be back.

1047
01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.340 line:82%
Come in.

1048
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.170 line:82%
Did you see today's
Mid-Day?

1049
01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:36.880 line:82%
John's did an interview.

1050
01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:39.130 line:82%
He said he is working with you.

1051
01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.250 line:82%
I saw it.

1052
01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:44.960 line:82%
Did you talk to director Kabir Kaushal?

1053
01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.250 line:82%
I did, Sona,

1054
01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:49.880 line:82%
but there is a problem.

1055
01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.340 line:82%
What problem?

1056
01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.420 line:82%
He wants a new girl.

1057
01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:58.460 line:82%
He's very clear about that.

1058
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:00.170 line:82%
I'm new.

1059
01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.460 line:82%
From where?

1060
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.210 line:82%
You have worked in
Teer Talvaar,
two Bhojpuri pictures.

1061
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:09.250 line:82%
And in many pictures you acted in two
to three scenes.

1062
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.460 line:82%
I did them because you told me.

1063
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:17.210 line:82%
I asked you every time and you said, "Do
it, there won't be any problem."

1064
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:19.340 line:82%
Look, I don't want
to have this discussion.

1065
01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.000 line:82%
Isn't this nonsense?

1066
01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:23.420 line:82%
Isn't it?

1067
01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.130 line:82%
You promised me a proper break.

1068
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.500 line:82%
A parallel role.

1069
01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:31.960 line:82%
And after wasting three years,
you say it's nonsense.

1070
01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:36.300 line:82%
You are talking as if I stopped you
from becoming a superstar.

1071
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.460 line:82%
The world has changed,
so has the industry

1072
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:42.880 line:82%
super models and beauty
pageant winners are becoming heroines.

1073
01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.050 line:82%
But I have the talent, I can act.

1074
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:47.550 line:82%
Who wants that?

1075
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:55.090 line:82%
Look, I don't want to break your heart
but no big hero will work with you.

1076
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.380 line:82%
You won't make a movie with me?

1077
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.300 line:82%
No, its not possible.

1078
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:21.170 line:82%
Look, Sona.

1079
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:23.380 line:82%
I really like you.

1080
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:27.500 line:82%
You keep visiting me
and I said I'll see

1081
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.050 line:82%
what I can do for you.

1082
01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.800 line:82%
Please stop this drama.

1083
01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.210 line:82%
I'm already worried.

1084
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.750 line:82%
You are here and I...

1085
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.880 line:82%
What happened?

1086
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.960 line:82%
-Sorry.
-What?

1087
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:42.800 line:82%
What happened, Satish?

1088
01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.380 line:82%
Nothing.

1089
01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:49.550 line:82%
She has worked in our film
Teer Talvar,
Roma darling.

1090
01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.960 line:82%
Sona Mishra.

1091
01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.550 line:82%
Then what happened?

1092
01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:59.170 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1093
01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:01.590 line:82%
There are some problems in my home.

1094
01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.630 line:82%
I had to give these.

1095
01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.090 line:82%
Are they yours?

1096
01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.800 line:82%
My cousin pictures.

1097
01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:15.340 line:82%
See if you can get him any role.

1098
01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:19.460 line:82%
I'll call if I have something for him.

1099
01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.920 line:82%
Thank you.

1100
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:36.840 line:82%
What was that about?

1101
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:39.050 line:82%
Well, same old story.

1102
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.460 line:82%
She is need, wants money.

1103
01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:43.300 line:82%
Spoiled my mood.

1104
01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:51.550 line:82%
They are old photos. Look at them.

1105
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:57.460 line:82%
Your judgment has always been correct.

1106
01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.710 line:82%
Reject. Oh my God!

1107
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:10.090 line:82%
What are you doing? Keep the rejected
ones here and accepted ones there.

1108
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:13.380 line:82%
-They should be good.
-What faces they have.

1109
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:17.960 line:82%
There was a time when we had Dharmendar,
Devender, Shammi Kapoor,

1110
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:19.300 line:82%
look what we have now.

1111
01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:22.420 line:82%
May I come in?

1112
01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:24.750 line:82%
Pinky, come in.

1113
01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.880 line:82%
Hi, Pinks.

1114
01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.710 line:82%
My, what a surprise, Pinky!

1115
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.250 line:82%
Forgot your path!

1116
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:33.880 line:82%
Ranjit, I had few photos,
thought it may help you.

1117
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.050 line:82%
Mind blowing! More the merrier.

1118
01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.590 line:82%
Pinky has become casting director.

1119
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.710 line:82%
At this time, you can only think
of family.

1120
01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:46.250 line:82%
That's true.

1121
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:48.130 line:82%
You've come at the right time.

1122
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:50.590 line:82%
I have ordered Chinese food
from Mainland China.

1123
01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.250 line:82%
Dablu, bring the food.

1124
01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.210 line:82%
Who's going to eat all this diet food?

1125
01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.670 line:82%
Don't worry he will eat that too.

1126
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:22.800 line:82%
Hello? Yes.

1127
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:24.750 line:82%
Who are you?

1128
01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:27.050 line:82%
One minute.

1129
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.500 line:82%
Vikram, call for you.

1130
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:32.750 line:82%
From Romy Rolly Production.

1131
01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:36.250 line:82%
Wait for a minute, Aunt Mohini.
Tell them to hold on.

1132
01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.880 line:82%
You are making the floor wet.

1133
01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.500 line:82%
Hello? Yes, speaking.

1134
01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:49.420 line:82%
No problem. I'll come.

1135
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:55.340 line:82%
Can you please tell me for which role?

1136
01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.420 line:82%
No, it's okay. I'll be there.

1137
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.960 line:82%
Bye, and thank you.

1138
01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.050 line:82%
Vikram.

1139
01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:37.500 line:82%
I was really drunk that night.

1140
01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.130 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1141
01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.800 line:82%
I'm really sorry.

1142
01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:00.630 line:82%
Shall we hang out tonight, and drink?

1143
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:12.130 line:82%
Hi, guess what.

1144
01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:16.130 line:82%
Today I got call from Romy Rolly
Production House.

1145
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:18.670 line:82%
For an audition.

1146
01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:23.250 line:82%
What happened?

1147
01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.420 line:82%
What happened?

1148
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:34.420 line:82%
Satish Chaudhary's film.

1149
01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:38.670 line:82%
It's not happening.

1150
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:41.880 line:82%
Happening.

1151
01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.380 line:82%
But I'm not in it.

1152
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:51.090 line:82%
It's not in my destiny.

1153
01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.170 line:82%
Not written in destiny?

1154
01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.710 line:82%
Look at me, Sona.

1155
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.050 line:82%
What's this destiny?

1156
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:17.050 line:82%
This word is for someone who can't make
their own life.

1157
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.340 line:82%
Haven't I been strong in life?

1158
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.050 line:82%
What have I got?

1159
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:25.380 line:82%
After three years, he tells me
I can't be anything.

1160
01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:26.630 line:82%
He is a bastard.

1161
01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.050 line:82%
Are you going to let this bastard
decide your future?

1162
01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.460 line:82%
Tell me one thing.

1163
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.750 line:82%
You came here to work for Chaudhary
or become an actor?

1164
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.250 line:82%
You trusted an other person.

1165
01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.380 line:82%
Now trust your self.

1166
01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:09.500 line:82%
Sona, chances are not given,
they are made.

1167
01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:15.590 line:82%
Success does not come to us.

1168
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.340 line:82%
We have to chase success.

1169
01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:25.460 line:82%
Keep walking in your path.

1170
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:27.750 line:82%
Keep walking.

1171
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:32.550 line:82%
The whole world will be with you soon.

1172
01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:58.130 line:82%
In every garden, a kid chases

1173
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.750 line:82%
Butterflies that are still hard to catch

1174
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:11.300 line:82%
Who will say this mad kid?

1175
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:17.710 line:82%
Whatever you are find in this world

1176
01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.250 line:82%
Whoever finds it

1177
01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:25.090 line:82%
Finds it only in the mind

1178
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:28.420 line:82%
Eyes filled with dreams

1179
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.250 line:82%
There is no sleep and patience

1180
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:35.000 line:82%
Eyes filled with dreams

1181
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:37.500 line:82%
There is no sleep and patience

1182
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:38.920 line:82%
Hello, friends, my name...

1183
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.250 line:82%
-Prabhu...
-Ritam Vishwas.

1184
01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.340 line:82%
-My mobile number is...
-99...

1185
01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:42.880 line:82%
-...932...
-...3700.

1186
01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.250 line:82%
-I'm from Jammu.
-I'm from Delhi.

1187
01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:45.170 line:82%
-Lucknow.
-Punjab.

1188
01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:46.250 line:82%
-Banaras.
-Nagpur.

1189
01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.840 line:82%
I came all the way from Calcutta
for this audition.

1190
01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.250 line:82%
I had a lot of experience in modeling...

1191
01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.210 line:82%
-...TV shows.
-I'm into theater too.

1192
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.050 line:82%
I have only done only one commercial
in two years.

1193
01:19:54.750 --> 01:20:00.090 line:82%
Whoever accepts this path

1194
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:06.630 line:82%
At every end there's path

1195
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:13.590 line:82%
A sunny path burns the feet

1196
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:20.340 line:82%
There is a turn but no shadow

1197
01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.750 line:82%
Seeker keeps on going

1198
01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.840 line:82%
Can you fill out my form?
I don't know English.

1199
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:27.550 line:82%
-What's your name?
-Rahul.

1200
01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:29.800 line:82%
There is no one...

1201
01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.130 line:82%
-Age?
-22.

1202
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.050 line:82%
Bupesh?

1203
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:39.920 line:82%
Eyes filled with dreams
Don't have sleep and patience

1204
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:46.170 line:82%
Eyes filled with dreams
Don't have sleep and patience

1205
01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:50.000 line:82%
The question is not a matter
of my life or death.

1206
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:51.420 line:82%
But the question is...

1207
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:52.710 line:82%
Question is...

1208
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.210 line:82%
Is there someone who created this world,

1209
01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:56.250 line:82%
and runs it?

1210
01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:00.090 line:82%
-If not my death...
-...then my death and life

1211
01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:01.300 line:82%
...is equal.

1212
01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:03.420 line:82%
And if he is somewhere

1213
01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.300 line:82%
Okay, thank you that was good.

1214
01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:08.590 line:82%
-Sir, I didn't complete it.
-I said it's okay.

1215
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:11.420 line:82%
Why doesn't he listen to his kids?

1216
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.420 line:82%
-Ma'am give me another chance, please.
-He'll call you back.

1217
01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:15.340 line:82%
Why doesn't he listen to his kids?

1218
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.420 line:82%
I will do better this time, ma'am.

1219
01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.920 line:82%
Why doesn't he listen to his kids?

1220
01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:27.420 line:82%
From far, everyone think it's sea

1221
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.710 line:82%
Is it water or sand?

1222
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.130 line:82%
Who knows?

1223
01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:40.750 line:82%
Days are different every day

1224
01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:49.250 line:82%
Happiness is different and patience
Is different

1225
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:55.880 line:82%
But the eyes that see it are different

1226
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:59.420 line:82%
Patience becomes mine

1227
01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:02.960 line:82%
And happiness gets away

1228
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:06.050 line:82%
Eyes filled with dreams

1229
01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:09.050 line:82%
No sleep and patience

1230
01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:15.550 line:82%
Eyes filled with dreams
Have no sleep and patience

1231
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:19.630 line:82%
Eyes filled with dreams

1232
01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.800 line:82%
Vikram Jaisingh?

1233
01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:33.000 line:82%
Eyes!

1234
01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.170 line:82%
-For which role?
-They didn't tell me.

1235
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:43.800 line:82%
Just asked for the name, age and height.

1236
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000 line:82%
Then a scene.

1237
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:49.340 line:82%
-Delivered it.
-Must have been like this.

1238
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.420 line:82%
Unless Romy Rolly's Production says
delivering small dialogs,

1239
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:55.380 line:82%
hires stars.

1240
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.420 line:82%
You think I should send my pictures?

1241
01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.050 line:82%
May be there are two-three roles.

1242
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:08.920 line:82%
You should try.

1243
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.630 line:82%
If there is someone,
then the question is,

1244
01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:18.420 line:82%
when will he listen to his kids?

1245
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:20.300 line:82%
He is good.

1246
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:23.710 line:82%
Shortlist him.

1247
01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:28.250 line:82%
Finally, a Tarzan after so many idiots.

1248
01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:31.340 line:82%
-How many shortlisted?
-Two.

1249
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:34.500 line:82%
-There is one more.
-Show.

1250
01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:37.050 line:82%
And rolling.

1251
01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.670 line:82%
My name is Vikram Jaisingh.
I'm 25 years-old, my height is 5'9.

1252
01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:47.920 line:82%
I have a certificate from Nandkishore
Acting School and did theater in Delhi.

1253
01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:52.880 line:82%
I think theater helped keep
the actor in me alive.

1254
01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:56.590 line:82%
Now the question is whether
I should live or die,

1255
01:23:57.630 --> 01:24:00.710 line:82%
the question is where is the care taker
of this world,

1256
01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:04.670 line:82%
if not available, my life and death
are equal.

1257
01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.840 line:82%
If there's someone,

1258
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:10.210 line:82%
then the question is, why doesn't he
listen to his kids?

1259
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.750 line:82%
Brother!

1260
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:16.750 line:82%
-He seems to be sincere.
-That is all okay.

1261
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:21.170 line:82%
-Who among them can dance?
-Yes, check that out too.

1262
01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.500 line:82%
These days a hero has to dance
more than the heroine.

1263
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.250 line:82%
I have met this boy.

1264
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.300 line:82%
I know this boy.

1265
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.630 line:82%
There are four new photos.

1266
01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:39.880 line:82%
Three are already shortlisted.

1267
01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:42.130 line:82%
But he's so cute!

1268
01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:44.750 line:82%
You're giving me more work.
Give me that.

1269
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.130 line:82%
A twenty four lens will
give the best shot.

1270
01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.920 line:82%
Tomorrow you will read this scene.

1271
01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.210 line:82%
-Sir, is this the lead role?
-Of course.

1272
01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:15.960 line:82%
Sir, thank you very much.

1273
01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.840 line:82%
Don't be thankful, it's not yet finalized.

1274
01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:20.250 line:82%
-Understood?
-Yes.

1275
01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:24.590 line:82%
Look, I was also an actor,
confidence is a good thing.

1276
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:27.170 line:82%
But not overconfidence.

1277
01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:28.420 line:82%
You're absolutely right, sir.

1278
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.920 line:82%
I'll see you tomorrow.

1279
01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.500 line:82%
Hey, listen.

1280
01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:39.210 line:82%
How do you know Neena?

1281
01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:42.670 line:82%
Not personally but I have met her once.

1282
01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.960 line:82%
Yes, she thought...

1283
01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:48.840 line:82%
She saw my screen test?

1284
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:51.500 line:82%
Her daughter is the movie's heroine.

1285
01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:55.300 line:82%
Me, brother and Neena are going
to make a decision.

1286
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.920 line:82%
Of course.

1287
01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:22.340 line:82%
Hi, I'm Kunal Khanna,
I want to meet Ranjit Rolly,

1288
01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:24.380 line:82%
-for a screen test.
-Please take a seat.

1289
01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:45.000 line:82%
Hi.

1290
01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.300 line:82%
You've come here for the test?

1291
01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.210 line:82%
I am here unnecessarily.

1292
01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.960 line:82%
You never know.

1293
01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.000 line:82%
I know.

1294
01:27:05.050 --> 01:27:07.210 line:82%
I was here yesterday for a scene.

1295
01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:13.090 line:82%
I heard Ranjit talking to someone
about you.

1296
01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:16.210 line:82%
About me?

1297
01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:18.170 line:82%
What was he saying?

1298
01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.630 line:82%
He was saying...

1299
01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.800 line:82%
-You're Kunal, right?
-Yeah.

1300
01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:26.550 line:82%
He was saying Kunal has confidence.

1301
01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:30.210 line:82%
He has this aggression, which is required
for the role.

1302
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:31.750 line:82%
Really?

1303
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.130 line:82%
Vikram Jaisingh?

1304
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:40.670 line:82%
Good luck.

1305
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:57.460 line:82%
Could you step back slightly?

1306
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:59.590 line:82%
Nikki?

1307
01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.000 line:82%
I'm really sorry.

1308
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:04.050 line:82%
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

1309
01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:05.380 line:82%
Make it quick.

1310
01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:10.670 line:82%
How are you?

1311
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:16.420 line:82%
-Have we already met?
-Yes, at
Pyar Hua
premiere party.

1312
01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:19.460 line:82%
I'm the one in this world
because of you.

1313
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:20.500 line:82%
Oh, yes!

1314
01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:23.380 line:82%
How could I forget that?

1315
01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:28.460 line:82%
Hi.

1316
01:28:29.670 --> 01:28:31.630 line:82%
Ratna, open up her hair for the test.

1317
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:35.130 line:82%
Open hair, baby, you look so beautiful!

1318
01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.630 line:82%
I already told her.

1319
01:28:37.210 --> 01:28:38.170 line:82%
Do it quickly.

1320
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.880 line:82%
Wow!

1321
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.800 line:82%
Seeing you like this reminds me
of Topal's
rain song.

1322
01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:53.170 line:82%
You were wearing
this same color saree.

1323
01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.380 line:82%
You remember a lot.

1324
01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:00.380 line:82%
Are you nervous?

1325
01:29:03.130 --> 01:29:04.250 line:82%
A little bit.

1326
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:07.300 line:82%
You don't need to be.

1327
01:29:13.630 --> 01:29:15.960 line:82%
-Shall we practice once?
-No, it's okay.

1328
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.460 line:82%
Ready, sir.

1329
01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.420 line:82%
All right. Taking...

1330
01:29:26.630 --> 01:29:27.920 line:82%
and action.

1331
01:29:28.710 --> 01:29:31.300 line:82%
-Why is it so, Priya?
-What?

1332
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:37.590 line:82%
A single meeting turned
into a close friendship.

1333
01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:43.710 line:82%
This can't be explained in words, Rahul.

1334
01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:49.500 line:82%
Which can't be expressed in words,

1335
01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:53.000 line:82%
can be expressed with a flower.

1336
01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:58.920 line:82%
Take this.

1337
01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.800 line:82%
What is he doing? I'm sorry.

1338
01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:09.710 line:82%
There was no flower,
something had to be given.

1339
01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.090 line:82%
It wasn't that bad.

1340
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:16.710 line:82%
-Okay, come on. Lets take it from the top.
-Yes, sir. No more horsing around.

1341
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.750 line:82%
-Come on stop giggling. Taking...
-Yes, order, sir.

1342
01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:23.840 line:82%
-Okay, no joking.
-And action.

1343
01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.090 line:82%
Why is it so, Priya?

1344
01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.750 line:82%
What?

1345
01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:34.960 line:82%
A single meeting turned
into a close friendship.

1346
01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:37.960 line:82%
That's the boy.

1347
01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:41.800 line:82%
-How charming.
-What are you saying, Neena?

1348
01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:43.800 line:82%
That second boy Kunal,

1349
01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.960 line:82%
looks like a young Shammi Kapoor.

1350
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.000 line:82%
No, Vikram is better.

1351
01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.210 line:82%
Kunal is overconfident.

1352
01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.960 line:82%
Multiplex audience will not like him.

1353
01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:55.380 line:82%
Have you seen his body?

1354
01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.090 line:82%
Remove his shirt in one or two scenes.

1355
01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.420 line:82%
Sister-in-law.

1356
01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.380 line:82%
I agree with Neena.

1357
01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.170 line:82%
I prefer Vikram.

1358
01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:09.960 line:82%
There's something cute about him.

1359
01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:14.250 line:82%
Ranjit, I think he'll drive
the girls crazy.

1360
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:16.500 line:82%
-Really?
-I like this boy.

1361
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.550 line:82%
He's finalized.

1362
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.050 line:82%
Vikram, where were you?

1363
01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:22.840 line:82%
Here.

1364
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:25.460 line:82%
What happened to your screen test?

1365
01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.670 line:82%
They said what they should say.

1366
01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:35.210 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

1367
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:40.170 line:82%
Sona, I have got that role.

1368
01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:43.710 line:82%
-They've given me the lead role.
-No!

1369
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:46.130 line:82%
I'm the lead!

1370
01:32:13.130 --> 01:32:14.300 line:82%
Won't get into the details.

1371
01:32:15.090 --> 01:32:16.300 line:82%
There was an opposition.

1372
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:18.710 line:82%
But I said...

1373
01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:21.340 line:82%
This is the boy I want in the film.

1374
01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.960 line:82%
After all, you are the boss, sir.

1375
01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:27.130 line:82%
I'm only here because of you.

1376
01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:33.090 line:82%
If it's God's plan,
you will sign many movies.

1377
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:36.300 line:82%
What was Zaffar when he came here?

1378
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:37.920 line:82%
And where is he now?

1379
01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:39.500 line:82%
Who made him?

1380
01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:41.340 line:82%
You have, sir.

1381
01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:43.420 line:82%
Son, guess...

1382
01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:46.420 line:82%
how much did I pay Zaffar
for his first film?

1383
01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:50.460 line:82%
How will I know?

1384
01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:53.340 line:82%
Try guessing a figure.

1385
01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:57.300 line:82%
No idea, sir.

1386
01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.210 line:82%
Fifty thousand.

1387
01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:05.800 line:82%
Five's my lucky number.
R-O-L-L-Y. Five.

1388
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.670 line:82%
And this five will take you to the skies.

1389
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:27.130 line:82%
-Nikki, I love...
-Puppies!

1390
01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:30.710 line:82%
-My weakness...
-Chocolate.

1391
01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.670 line:82%
-My color...
-Pink.

1392
01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:39.130 line:82%
-I hate...
-Spiders!

1393
01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.000 line:82%
Hi, baby.

1394
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:47.880 line:82%
Vikram called.

1395
01:33:48.630 --> 01:33:50.840 line:82%
He said, "Thank you so much.

1396
01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:52.960 line:82%
I got this film because of you."

1397
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:54.960 line:82%
That's really sweet of him, right?

1398
01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:58.130 line:82%
Anyway, I told him to come here
for the rehearsal.

1399
01:33:58.420 --> 01:33:59.920 line:82%
-Here?
-Yes, it'll be nice.

1400
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.340 line:82%
Excuse me, ma'am if we can get a picture
of the both of you, it would be great.

1401
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:05.460 line:82%
Are you mad?

1402
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.500 line:82%
I mean, look at me.

1403
01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.630 line:82%
Take her picture against that wall,
it will look very nice, okay?

1404
01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:17.300 line:82%
-My favorite person...
-My mother.

1405
01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:23.550 line:82%
Say something interesting
about your boyfriend.

1406
01:34:24.090 --> 01:34:24.960 line:82%
Why?

1407
01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:27.050 line:82%
Romy Rolly and Subhana are very close.

1408
01:34:27.170 --> 01:34:28.840 line:82%
And he has become a hero.

1409
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.800 line:82%
I should write something.

1410
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:32.880 line:82%
Subhana won't do this for free.

1411
01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.460 line:82%
If you won't do it for free,
then why should I?

1412
01:34:35.630 --> 01:34:40.170 line:82%
Your boyfriend is a big star,
so you will become...

1413
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.840 line:82%
a star wife.

1414
01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:45.000 line:82%
You will shop in Rome, Milan and Paris.

1415
01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.500 line:82%
And will talk about your star husband.

1416
01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:50.960 line:82%
He's so busy,
sometimes I feel bad for him.

1417
01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:52.300 line:82%
Poor baby.

1418
01:34:54.210 --> 01:34:57.210 line:82%
God blesses you
with happiness and success.

1419
01:35:03.710 --> 01:35:05.420 line:82%
I have to be there by 11:00 a.m.

1420
01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:07.800 line:82%
Aunt Mohini,

1421
01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:10.500 line:82%
I was wondering...

1422
01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:12.750 line:82%
if I should take a loan from Dad?

1423
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:16.170 line:82%
I need to organize a flat soon.

1424
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:18.050 line:82%
Why?

1425
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.840 line:82%
My house seems small for you?

1426
01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:23.800 line:82%
You can live here
for as long as you like.

1427
01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:26.210 line:82%
I feel safe, when you are here.

1428
01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.130 line:82%
This is my room.

1429
01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:46.750 line:82%
Why don't you sit?

1430
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:48.840 line:82%
You...

1431
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:50.800 line:82%
You live in a cake.

1432
01:35:51.130 --> 01:35:52.420 line:82%
Shut up, okay!

1433
01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.460 line:82%
That's Cuputie.

1434
01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:01.000 line:82%
Who?

1435
01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:04.250 line:82%
Cuputie, my little doggy.

1436
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:07.210 line:82%
This is Vikram, say hi.

1437
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:10.670 line:82%
Hi, Gapoochie.

1438
01:36:12.670 --> 01:36:15.300 line:82%
My sister couldn't have committed suicide.

1439
01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:17.420 line:82%
Someone killed her.

1440
01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:20.170 line:82%
-One minute, ma'am.
-Yes.

1441
01:36:21.090 --> 01:36:23.050 line:82%
It's "blood." Not "blud."

1442
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.960 line:82%
Blud.

1443
01:36:26.050 --> 01:36:27.340 line:82%
Like this. Blood.

1444
01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.840 line:82%
Blood.

1445
01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.630 line:82%
-I'll murder.
-Means.

1446
01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.960 line:82%
Ma'am forget the word blood, and say
"someone has murdered her."

1447
01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:42.710 line:82%
-Lets continue.
-Yes.

1448
01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:47.710 line:82%
She was happy, and was in love
with someone...

1449
01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.590 line:82%
And in love, one can die.

1450
01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:54.750 line:82%
And can also kill.

1451
01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.170 line:82%
Nikki, your line?

1452
01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.920 line:82%
Your line?

1453
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:04.710 line:82%
What's my line?

1454
01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:10.210 line:82%
Vikram.

1455
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:12.300 line:82%
Come here.

1456
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000 line:82%
Hi, Neena.

1457
01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:16.420 line:82%
Hi, Vikram.

1458
01:37:17.250 --> 01:37:19.340 line:82%
Nikki said you weren't feeling well.

1459
01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:21.170 line:82%
I have a cold.

1460
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000 line:82%
Come on, sit down.

1461
01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.880 line:82%
-Here.
-Thanks.

1462
01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:34.500 line:82%
So, how was the rehearsal?

1463
01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.460 line:82%
Not bad.

1464
01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:39.800 line:82%
It has now started.

1465
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.630 line:82%
We used to get the dialogs on set.

1466
01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:46.250 line:82%
You were still amazing
in your performances.

1467
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.800 line:82%
Is your contract signed?

1468
01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:55.000 line:82%
Tomorrow.

1469
01:37:55.630 --> 01:37:56.750 line:82%
How much are they paying you?

1470
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:57.960 line:82%
Mom!

1471
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:59.460 line:82%
It's okay.

1472
01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.710 line:82%
They were saying 50,000.

1473
01:38:02.630 --> 01:38:04.300 line:82%
Fifty thousand? That's it?

1474
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.090 line:82%
Five is Romy's lucky number, so...

1475
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:14.590 line:82%
If its in Rolly's hands, his lucky number
would be zero.

1476
01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:17.630 line:82%
I'll talk to him.

1477
01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:19.630 line:82%
No, Neena.

1478
01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.550 line:82%
-He might feel bad.
-Nothings going to happen.

1479
01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:24.500 line:82%
I'll recommend it.

1480
01:38:25.630 --> 01:38:26.590 line:82%
Don't worry.

1481
01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.210 line:82%
Now I am getting 500,000.

1482
01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:40.630 line:82%
Five lakhs.

1483
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.000 line:82%
All because of Neena.

1484
01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:46.630 line:82%
You charmed Neena or was it her idea?

1485
01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:49.170 line:82%
Look, my grand mom used to say,

1486
01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:52.460 line:82%
"To make a sweet you need to add sugar."

1487
01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:54.800 line:82%
You are naughty.

1488
01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.000 line:82%
How is Nikki?

1489
01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:02.340 line:82%
Means?

1490
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:08.420 line:82%
She loves her doggy Gapoochie

1491
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.000 line:82%
so, so much.

1492
01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:19.000 line:82%
You are going away for a month.

1493
01:39:19.670 --> 01:39:21.340 line:82%
-I will be bored.
-Why?

1494
01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.130 line:82%
Sing sad songs.

1495
01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:26.960 line:82%
Never say

1496
01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.550 line:82%
Good bye

1497
01:39:48.670 --> 01:39:50.590 line:82%
It's beautiful!

1498
01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.710 line:82%
Do you know, Minty dear?

1499
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.960 line:82%
Initially every film was shot in India.

1500
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:00.590 line:82%
Is this location lesser
than Switzerland?

1501
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.460 line:82%
Don't you think so, Pinky?
It's very pretty!

1502
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:05.210 line:82%
Romy?

1503
01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.670 line:82%
If you had had a star,

1504
01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:09.550 line:82%
you would've been abroad.

1505
01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:11.500 line:82%
Right.

1506
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:14.000 line:82%
Good observation, Madam Neena.

1507
01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:18.090 line:82%
But what matters is that I'm happy
with this location.

1508
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.000 line:82%
And I am happy with this boy.

1509
01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:23.300 line:82%
I want you to sit on the other horse.

1510
01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:26.670 line:82%
This Vikram is from theater,
yet he's dashing, isn't he, Satish?

1511
01:40:29.210 --> 01:40:30.170 line:82%
Okay, good.

1512
01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:34.380 line:82%
Many from theater have come
to Bollywood.

1513
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.750 line:82%
Please don't say Bollywood.
I hate that word.

1514
01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:40.920 line:82%
We are the Hindi film industry.

1515
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:42.960 line:82%
Excuse me.

1516
01:40:45.090 --> 01:40:46.210 line:82%
Tired of standing.

1517
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:48.670 line:82%
Brother!

1518
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:51.170 line:82%
You're screwed till the movie is over.

1519
01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:55.250 line:82%
Actually she's not a bad person.

1520
01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:57.750 line:82%
Actually, you know, she's...

1521
01:40:58.590 --> 01:40:59.710 line:82%
She's very complex.

1522
01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:03.500 line:82%
The sequence is, the heroine's horse
runs out of control,

1523
01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.210 line:82%
"Help! Help!" And all that.

1524
01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:07.210 line:82%
Then comes my hero on a horse.

1525
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:12.750 line:82%
Grabs the heroine and they fall down.

1526
01:41:13.170 --> 01:41:15.000 line:82%
I will shoot this in slow motion.

1527
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:20.170 line:82%
I am getting goose bumps.

1528
01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:22.090 line:82%
Romance and thrill together.

1529
01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:31.960 line:82%
Good shot, guys.

1530
01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.000 line:82%
Are you okay?

1531
01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.550 line:82%
"Saturn is on the rise.

1532
01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:49.630 line:82%
A family member may be the cause
of some mental trauma."

1533
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.670 line:82%
We all know that.

1534
01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:54.630 line:82%
"The next few weeks could see
a romance bloom."

1535
01:41:56.130 --> 01:41:57.340 line:82%
You heard that?

1536
01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.380 line:82%
Whats your zodiac sign?

1537
01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:26.130 line:82%
Capricorn.

1538
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:30.710 line:82%
I'm a Virgo.

1539
01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:40.130 line:82%
Nikki!

1540
01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:42.800 line:82%
Are you here to chit chat?

1541
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:44.840 line:82%
Done with your exercise?

1542
01:42:47.630 --> 01:42:49.590 line:82%
That is a lot of money
riding on your waistline.

1543
01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:56.420 line:82%
I'm coming with you.

1544
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:01.750 line:82%
Sorry.

1545
01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.550 line:82%
This is required.

1546
01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:06.130 line:82%
Today's girls...

1547
01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:09.300 line:82%
zero dedication.

1548
01:43:11.210 --> 01:43:14.420 line:82%
Thats why, Neena,
there is no one like you.

1549
01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.250 line:82%
Doctor! Come quick!

1550
01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:25.670 line:82%
Patient in bed number seven
is collapsing, doctor.

1551
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:27.130 line:82%
-Oh my gosh!
-Cut!

1552
01:43:28.050 --> 01:43:29.090 line:82%
Good.

1553
01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.380 line:82%
-Was that okay, sir?
-Thank you. You are done.

1554
01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.420 line:82%
You're still here?

1555
01:43:38.630 --> 01:43:40.170 line:82%
Finalize something.

1556
01:43:41.250 --> 01:43:43.170 line:82%
You said you won't go outdoors.

1557
01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.750 line:82%
How?

1558
01:43:46.130 --> 01:43:48.340 line:82%
You have already shot a scene
in this movie.

1559
01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:49.920 line:82%
You were in a song.

1560
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:51.960 line:82%
That song was shot with Zaffar Khan.

1561
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:53.710 line:82%
It will have to be re-shot.

1562
01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:55.420 line:82%
What's your point?

1563
01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:56.840 line:82%
You keep acting.

1564
01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:58.800 line:82%
Try to understand.

1565
01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:01.090 line:82%
Now Vikram is the hero.

1566
01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.880 line:82%
How will he feel if I act
in just three scenes?

1567
01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:07.250 line:82%
What's this? I'm really fed up, Sona.

1568
01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.050 line:82%
I'm tired of you.

1569
01:44:09.630 --> 01:44:10.800 line:82%
First it was Chaudhary,

1570
01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.710 line:82%
now it's Vikram and these three scenes.

1571
01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:15.590 line:82%
Who is making you, Mother India?

1572
01:44:16.210 --> 01:44:18.840 line:82%
Well, don't work for me then, okay?

1573
01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:20.800 line:82%
Okay, madam. Okay!

1574
01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:22.710 line:82%
I am not running out of work.

1575
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.670 line:82%
Hi, may I come in?

1576
01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:54.050 line:82%
I've come to apologize.

1577
01:44:54.630 --> 01:44:56.880 line:82%
The shooting was delayed because of me.

1578
01:44:57.670 --> 01:45:00.550 line:82%
My costumer forgot to bring the costume.

1579
01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:04.090 line:82%
It's okay. Sit.

1580
01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:10.550 line:82%
You must have noticed.

1581
01:45:11.050 --> 01:45:15.840 line:82%
In my serious scenes, I wear loose
black, gray, dull clothes.

1582
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:18.090 line:82%
It's my characterization.

1583
01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:20.670 line:82%
It's very good.

1584
01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:22.800 line:82%
Color is important for a performance.

1585
01:45:27.710 --> 01:45:28.670 line:82%
Where is Neena?

1586
01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:31.300 line:82%
She's sleeping.

1587
01:45:34.090 --> 01:45:35.920 line:82%
Mom's too strict.

1588
01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:38.840 line:82%
If she finds out that I'm sitting
here right now,

1589
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.380 line:82%
she'd be very angry.

1590
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:42.710 line:82%
But,

1591
01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.500 line:82%
She's sleeping.

1592
01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:50.960 line:82%
And Tanya?

1593
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:52.800 line:82%
Watching a film.

1594
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:03.750 line:82%
Hey!

1595
01:46:05.050 --> 01:46:06.130 line:82%
Nice jacket.

1596
01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:09.590 line:82%
Is it yours?

1597
01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.590 line:82%
All clothes in this room are mine.

1598
01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:15.630 line:82%
Except the one you are wearing.

1599
01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:20.460 line:82%
You're very funny!

1600
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:25.880 line:82%
You want something to drink?

1601
01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:30.000 line:82%
You know,

1602
01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.380 line:82%
what Tanya says about you?

1603
01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:36.170 line:82%
What?

1604
01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:39.800 line:82%
She's says, "He's very funny."

1605
01:46:41.170 --> 01:46:42.750 line:82%
She's my best friend.

1606
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.630 line:82%
I can tell her anything.

1607
01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:48.090 line:82%
She'll never tell anybody.

1608
01:46:48.670 --> 01:46:49.550 line:82%
Never!

1609
01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:54.130 line:82%
You're a very lucky girl.

1610
01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.710 line:82%
I've heard that so many times.

1611
01:46:59.170 --> 01:47:02.250 line:82%
Everyone thinks star kids take things
for granted.

1612
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:04.750 line:82%
It's not that easy.

1613
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.170 line:82%
There are a lot of expectations.

1614
01:47:10.130 --> 01:47:12.250 line:82%
Now I'm going to be compared
to Mom, you know.

1615
01:47:13.670 --> 01:47:14.750 line:82%
So what?

1616
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:18.250 line:82%
If she is Neena,

1617
01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:23.670 line:82%
you are Nikki.

1618
01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:33.460 line:82%
If they find out I'm in your room.

1619
01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.460 line:82%
What will everybody say?

1620
01:47:43.210 --> 01:47:44.920 line:82%
People are so narrow minded.

1621
01:47:53.670 --> 01:47:55.000 line:82%
Do you have a girl friend?

1622

No.

1623
01:48:03.170 --> 01:48:05.000 line:82%
I've never had a boyfriend.

1624
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:09.340 line:82%
Can you believe it?

1625

Your eyes are puffy.

1628
01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.130 line:82%
-Suresh.
-Yes.

1629
01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:34.500 line:82%
Cover it.

1630
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.750 line:82%
You should keep an eye on her.

1631
01:48:45.710 --> 01:48:47.050 line:82%
I'm going to Mumbai tomorrow.

1632
01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:49.710 line:82%

01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:56.920 line:82%
Mom,

1636
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:59.920 line:82%
Tanya also wants to leave.

1637
01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:03.800 line:82%
I'll be so lonely.

1638
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.000 line:82%
Bye, baby.

1639
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:16.960 line:82%
Bye guys, have a safe journey.
Bye Tanya.

1640
01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:47.670 line:82%
When the air recites

1641
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:52.960 line:82%
Our love poem

1642
01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:59.500 line:82%
The atmosphere and earth listens

1643
01:49:59.630 --> 01:50:03.840 line:82%
Even the sky listens

1644
01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:07.800 line:82%
When the air recites

1645
01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:12.460 line:82%
Our love poem

1646
01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:19.750 line:82%
The atmosphere and earth listens

1647
01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:23.920 line:82%
Even the sky listens

1648
01:50:25.590 --> 01:50:30.090 line:82%
That's why there is fragrance
In flower buds

1649
01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:35.210 line:82%
Thats why there is magic
In mountains and streams

1650
01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:40.250 line:82%
That's why they are radiant

1651
01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:44.920 line:82%
Paths and valleys

1652
01:50:45.250 --> 01:50:47.750 line:82%
When air recites

1653
01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:53.630 line:82%
Our love poems

1654
01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:59.920 line:82%
The atmosphere and earth listens

1655
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.710 line:82%
And Even the sky listens

1656
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:40.000 line:82%
Lonely is also smelling

1657
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.750 line:82%
Some seasons feel lazy

1658
01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:50.590 line:82%
Feelings coming from the heart

1659
01:51:51.170 --> 01:51:55.590 line:82%
With drowsiness

1660
01:51:55.750 --> 01:52:00.500 line:82%
Keep some distance from me

1661
01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:05.130 line:82%
Then the story will remain incomplete

1662
01:52:05.710 --> 01:52:11.170 line:82%
The story doesn't have to be complete now

1663
01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:16.250 line:82%
Thats why there is thirst to meet you

1664
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:21.750 line:82%
Thats why there is need for love

1665
01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:26.300 line:82%
Thats why distance seems

1666
01:52:26.710 --> 01:52:30.920 line:82%
Beautiful

1667
01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:34.090 line:82%
When the air recites

1668
01:52:34.170 --> 01:52:38.880 line:82%
Our love poem

1669
01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:46.050 line:82%
The atmosphere and earth listens

1670
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:50.090 line:82%
And even the sky listens

1671
01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:12.000 line:82%
Thats why paths

1672
01:53:12.090 --> 01:53:16.130 line:82%
And valleys are

1673
01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:19.960 line:82%
Scattered

1674
01:53:22.090 --> 01:53:23.130 line:82%
And cut.

1675
01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:25.920 line:82%
Rewind it.

1676
01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:46.250 line:82%
Where are you, Laxmi?

1677
01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:49.170 line:82%
It's good you called me.
I was about to call you.

1678
01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:50.630 line:82%
Is everything good?

1679
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:52.960 line:82%
-
I don't think so.
-Why?

1680
01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:56.130 line:82%
Is something going on
between Nikki and Vikram?

1681
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:59.090 line:82%
Are you mad? He called me four times
last week.

1682
01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:01.000 line:82%
He makes fun of her.

1683
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:04.670 line:82%
Don't overthink it.
Guess where I'm calling from?

1684
01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.880 line:82%
Where are you now?

1685
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.420 line:82%
In Vikram's hotel. Don't tell him.

1686
01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:09.800 line:82%
My surprise for him.

1687
01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:11.460 line:82%
-
When did you come?
-Now.

1688
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:15.710 line:82%
Call me in the evening, we will hang out.

1689
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:17.800 line:82%
-
Okay?
-Okay, I'll call later.

1690
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:23.880 line:82%
-Vikram?
-Yeah

1691
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.300 line:82%
Is 6:30 p.m. a good time for you tomorrow?

1692
01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:28.380 line:82%
Yeah, 6:30 p.m. is fine.

1693
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:30.880 line:82%

1698
01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.340 line:82%

1699
01:54:51.630 --> 01:54:52.710 line:82%
Nothing, come on.

1700
01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.170 line:82%
I was thinking that you...

1701
01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:58.920 line:82%
came in vain.

1702
01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:01.920 line:82%
I was about to return after two days.

1703
01:55:05.590 --> 01:55:07.210 line:82%

I thought I'll stay with you.

1707
01:55:22.630 --> 01:55:23.750 line:82%
It will get awkward.

1708
01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:27.670 line:82%
I'm here on producer's money.

1709
01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:30.250 line:82%
Strangers aren't allowed.

1710
01:55:31.590 --> 01:55:32.750 line:82%
You know what I mean?

1711
01:55:34.670 --> 01:55:39.880 line:82%
It's okay, my friend Laxmi stays
in another hotel. I'll stay with her.

1712
01:55:41.210 --> 01:55:42.460 line:82%
It's no problem.

1713
01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:48.840 line:82%
How will you go?
I'll arrange a car for you.

1714
01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:52.630 line:82%

1719
01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.590 line:82%
Who told you?

01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:15.500 line:82%

1721
01:56:34.590 --> 01:56:36.210 line:82%
Hundred percent sure news.

1722
01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:39.500 line:82%

Have you lost your mind?

1734
01:57:10.090 --> 01:57:12.460 line:82%

When will you understand the world.

1740
01:57:24.590 --> 01:57:27.800 line:82%
That boy has become
the hero of a big film,

1741
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:29.880 line:82%
are you getting it?

1742
01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:32.630 line:82%
No one is anything.

1743
01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:38.050 line:82%
Sit down.

1744
01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:49.710 line:82%
Hi.

1745
01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:50.750 line:82%
Hey.

1746
01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:53.590 line:82%
Hello, Neena.

1747
01:57:58.880 --> 01:57:59.840 line:82%
God!

1748
01:58:01.210 --> 01:58:02.500 line:82%
How many suitcases?

1749
01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:07.500 line:82%
Do you know big actresses carry
twenty suitcases?

1750
01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:08.920 line:82%
Really?

1751
01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:13.340 line:82%
Then how many suitcases left
to become a big actress?

1752
01:58:15.170 --> 01:58:16.250 line:82%
You're very funny.

1753
01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:22.960 line:82%
Since when...

1754
01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:25.960 line:82%
has this drama started?

1755
01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:32.630 line:82%
There is nothing like that.

1756
01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:35.210 line:82%
They just make fun of each other.

1757
01:58:35.710 --> 01:58:36.630 line:82%
That's it.

1758
01:58:38.050 --> 01:58:40.670 line:82%
I'll break your teeth with my shoes.

1759
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:42.750 line:82%
Am I a fool?

1760
01:58:52.050 --> 01:58:54.090 line:82%
Why are you so serious? Smile.

1761
01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:58.460 line:82%
We have a good record for our film.

1762
01:58:59.670 --> 01:59:04.300 line:82%
Tomorrow when you return, the media
will be running b you.

1763
01:59:06.250 --> 01:59:07.250 line:82%
Enjoy it.

1764
01:59:09.170 --> 01:59:10.250 line:82%
But be very careful.

1765
01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:14.340 line:82%
Look, the media tries to find sensation.

1766
01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:16.920 line:82%
And if they feel,

1767
01:59:18.130 --> 01:59:20.340 line:82%
that you guys have something going on,

1768
01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:21.670 line:82%
or anything...

1769
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:22.920 line:82%
But Mom,

1770
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:24.710 line:82%
there's nothing like that.

1771
01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:26.340 line:82%
I know, of course.

1772
01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:30.000 line:82%
You guys are just friends
and make fun of each other.

1773
01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:35.550 line:82%
Look, right now,
every girl is supposed to think,

1774
01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:38.130 line:82%
"I wish he was my boyfriend."

1775
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:44.300 line:82%
And every boy should wish
you were his girlfriend.

1776
01:59:46.090 --> 01:59:47.300 line:82%
And if that doesn't happen...

1777
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.300 line:82%
not good for your image.

1778
01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:53.670 line:82%
-But Mom...
-She's right, Nikki.

1779
01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:57.210 line:82%
Why give everyone a wrong impression?

1780
01:59:59.550 --> 02:00:01.960 line:82%
Look. He understood me.

1781
02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:07.250 line:82%
Like, you should not sit so close
to each other.

1782
02:00:16.170 --> 02:00:19.130 line:82%
It's just gone by too soon.
It's not fair, like...

1783
02:00:19.710 --> 02:00:21.170 line:82%
But it's also a musical love story.

1784
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:25.590 line:82%
Hi.

1785
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:32.630 line:82%
Hi, Sona.

1786
02:00:33.170 --> 02:00:34.880 line:82%
I know you're angry with me.

1787
02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:38.880 line:82%
But we need to talk.

1788
02:00:40.130 --> 02:00:43.670 line:82%
I came to meet you few days back, but you
were not there.

1789
02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:49.050 line:82%
Sona, I've a flat in Versova.

1790
02:00:51.130 --> 02:00:53.130 line:82%
Few friends are coming
in the evening.

1791
02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:58.550 line:82%
If you can come...
If free, please do come.

1792
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.050 line:82%
Please come.

1793
02:01:23.250 --> 02:01:24.590 line:82%
-Hey.
-Hi.

1794
02:01:32.250 --> 02:01:33.630 line:82%
Hey, Vikram?

1795
02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:37.800 line:82%
Do you remember, I was writing a script?

1796
02:01:38.630 --> 02:01:39.750 line:82%
Yeah.

1797
02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:43.550 line:82%
Will you hear its narration?

1798
02:01:45.090 --> 02:01:46.090 line:82%
Definitely, brother!

1799
02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:47.920 line:82%
You give me two or three days.

1800
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:51.550 line:82%
Take your time.
But it will be fantastic for you.

1801
02:01:55.590 --> 02:01:56.460 line:82%
Cheers!

1802
02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.880 line:82%
Very deep thinking.

1803
02:02:06.170 --> 02:02:09.800 line:82%
I was wondering how life can change
overnight.

1804
02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:14.670 line:82%
New house and car.

1805
02:02:16.670 --> 02:02:17.920 line:82%
Between you and me,

1806
02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:19.920 line:82%
took loan from Dad.

1807
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:30.300 line:82%
New girlfriend, and friends.

1808
02:02:39.250 --> 02:02:41.550 line:82%
I can't believe we're going
to be on the cover for
Glitter.

1809
02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:43.920 line:82%
Why? Where else would you be?

1810
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:47.090 line:82%
They are my star couple.

1811
02:02:52.750 --> 02:02:56.090 line:82%
How do you feel to be paired...

1812
02:02:56.630 --> 02:02:58.960 line:82%
with a new comer
rather than Zaffar Khan?

1813
02:02:59.590 --> 02:03:02.130 line:82%
An artist walks on his talent.

1814
02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:05.380 line:82%
It doesn't matter
who is in the front of him.

1815
02:03:07.130 --> 02:03:09.590 line:82%
She has done a good job.
I liked it.

1816
02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.500 line:82%
And this boy...

1817
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:15.750 line:82%
won't say anything.
Touch wood.

1818
02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:17.710 line:82%
Volcano of talent.

1819
02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:21.420 line:82%
Write my words down please.
Volcano of talent.

1820
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:25.090 line:82%
Son, bring some snacks here.

1821
02:03:28.050 --> 02:03:31.090 line:82%
You know my friend, Sona Mishra?

1822
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:33.960 line:82%
Oh, you are her friend.

1823
02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:36.800 line:82%
Who is Sona?

1824
02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:40.750 line:82%
My friend.

1825
02:03:42.090 --> 02:03:42.920 line:82%
Snacks?

1826
02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:44.420 line:82%
No, sir.

1827
02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.630 line:82%
Just give me a sec.

1828
02:04:01.670 --> 02:04:02.750 line:82%
Hi, Nikki.

1829
02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.590 line:82%
Hi, how are you?

1830
02:04:05.130 --> 02:04:06.130 line:82%
Very well.

1831
02:04:06.590 --> 02:04:07.670 line:82%
This is Vikram.

1832
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.090 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi, Kareena.

1833
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.670 line:82%
-Nice house.
-Thank you.

1834
02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.880 line:82%
He was feeling very awkward to come.

1835
02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:18.210 line:82%
Don't be silly,
you can come over any time.

1836
02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:20.880 line:82%
-Thanks.
-Just kidding.

1837
02:04:23.170 --> 02:04:24.710 line:82%
What will you have to drink?

1838
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000 line:82%
Cheers!

1839
02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:28.130 line:82%
-You good?
-Yes.

1840
02:04:36.590 --> 02:04:38.420 line:82%
...you do this well, it's good.

1841
02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:43.880 line:82%
Give me a second...

1842
02:04:49.670 --> 02:04:51.050 line:82%
Hey, Nikki, how are you?

1843
02:04:51.170 --> 02:04:52.300 line:82%
Good.

1844
02:04:53.090 --> 02:04:54.800 line:82%
-And you?
-I'm all right.

1845
02:04:55.210 --> 02:04:56.250 line:82%
Getting along.

1846
02:04:58.250 --> 02:05:01.090 line:82%
Oh, this is Vikram.

1847
02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:04.550 line:82%
Hi, all good?

1848
02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:06.340 line:82%
I think so.

1849
02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:10.590 line:82%
Everything will be good.
Good luck.

1850
02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:12.300 line:82%
Thanks.

1851
02:05:15.250 --> 02:05:17.840 line:82%
-Say hello to your mom.
-Sure.

1852
02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:20.380 line:82%
See you.

1853
02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:33.840 line:82%
So,

1854
02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:37.130 line:82%
Uncle Romy hero.
Just met Uncle Romy's discovery.

1855
02:05:40.630 --> 02:05:41.670 line:82%
What do you think?

1856
02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:45.590 line:82%
Not bad. Potential.

1857
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:47.590 line:82%
Did he thank you?

1858
02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:48.710 line:82%
To me?

1859
02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:51.550 line:82%
I mean, he's only at this party because
you left that film.

1860
02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:53.960 line:82%
-Come on.
-It's a fact.

1861
02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:55.840 line:82%
That's how outsiders come in.

1862
02:05:56.590 --> 02:05:59.170 line:82%
Someone writes a script and a big star
rejects it.

1863
02:05:59.710 --> 02:06:01.750 line:82%
And a newcomer gets his break.
Simple.

1864
02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:04.420 line:82%
Like?

1865
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:06.250 line:82%
Darr, Bazigar.

1866
02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:08.000 line:82%
I mean, many stars rejected it.

1867
02:06:08.170 --> 02:06:10.500 line:82%
Only one man did it.
Shah Rukh Khan.

1868
02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:12.000 line:82%
Of course,
Zanjeer.

1869
02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:14.130 line:82%
Seven big actors rejected it.

1870
02:06:14.210 --> 02:06:17.000 line:82%
The role was given to a struggling actor
named...

1871
02:06:17.630 --> 02:06:18.880 line:82%
Amitabh Bachchan

1872
02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:20.050 line:82%
Right answer.

1873
02:06:20.250 --> 02:06:21.380 line:82%
So you never know.

1874
02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:24.380 line:82%
Why didn't you tell me before?

1875
02:06:25.050 --> 02:06:26.300 line:82%
You didn't ask me.

1876
02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:46.840 line:82%
Tanvir, come on, sit down.

1877
02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:49.050 line:82%
I've got a job for you.

1878
02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:53.130 line:82%
Nikki and that new boy,
they're having an affair.

1879
02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:54.590 line:82%
Vikram Jaisingh?

1880
02:06:54.670 --> 02:06:58.460 line:82%
Anyways, Nikki's friend Tanya
lives in Bandra,

1881
02:06:58.630 --> 02:07:01.170 line:82%
they meet at her house, and that's
where they have their rendezvous.

1882
02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:02.630 line:82%
Are you sure?

1883
02:07:03.090 --> 02:07:05.670 line:82%
Don't ask me stupid questions.
Just go follow the story.

1884
02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:07.630 line:82%
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1885
02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:15.710 line:82%
Sona, it's Tanvir.

1886
02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:20.340 line:82%
Sona, I want to talk to you.
It's regarding Vikram.

1887
02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:23.800 line:82%
I know you are inside.

1888
02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:28.670 line:82%
Open the door, Sona.

1889
02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:34.880 line:82%
Stop disturbing us.

1890
02:07:55.090 --> 02:07:58.380 line:82%
"The debutante, leading man and producer
of Romy Rolly's Dil Ki Aag...

1891
02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:00.340 line:82%
...is a deadly boy, Vikram Jaisingh.

1892
02:08:00.670 --> 02:08:03.210 line:82%
His middle name could very well be
'The user.'

1893
02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:06.380 line:82%
Vikram uses others as a ladder.

1894
02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:09.750 line:82%
The first run on the ladder
of his gold blooded ambition,

1895
02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:12.090 line:82%
was a poor little starlet called
Sona Mishra.

1896
02:08:12.170 --> 02:08:14.590 line:82%
Vikram almost lived at her house.

1897
02:08:14.670 --> 02:08:18.630 line:82%
-He spent his penniless...
-...days with the help of Sona.

1898
02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.710 line:82%
But people like Vikram don't understand
the meaning of the word 'gratitude.'

1899
02:08:22.090 --> 02:08:26.460 line:82%
After getting into the film he started
pleasing Nikki and her mother.

1900
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:29.090 line:82%
Everybody knows what her
mother has done.

1901
02:08:29.250 --> 02:08:30.630 line:82%
Her daughter is the same.

1902
02:08:31.130 --> 02:08:33.800 line:82%
Here was a boy who managed to charm
both, mother and daughter...

1903
02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:35.550 line:82%
...until a crew member stated...

1904
02:08:35.630 --> 02:08:36.960 line:82%
...in outdoor shootings...

1905
02:08:37.050 --> 02:08:39.000 line:82%
...Vikram wooed Neena in the morning...

1906
02:08:39.090 --> 02:08:41.420 line:82%
...and was playing with Nikki at night...

1907
02:08:41.550 --> 02:08:43.880 line:82%
On coming back,
Vikram didn't waste any time...

1908
02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:45.880 line:82%
...before dropping poor Sona Mishra.

1909
02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:49.460 line:82%
If he gets involved
with a second grade starlet...

1910
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:51.670 line:82%
...it wont be good for his star image.

1911
02:08:52.250 --> 02:08:55.420 line:82%
And now, perhaps he's waiting for
the release and success of his first film

1912
02:08:55.670 --> 02:08:58.800 line:82%
So he would get a chance to kick
Neena and Nikki on their faces

1913
02:08:59.250 --> 02:09:00.800 line:82%
and look for new pastures."

1914
02:09:04.210 --> 02:09:07.000 line:82%
How dare you publish such nonsense.

1915
02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:09.250 line:82%
Frustrated bitch.

1916
02:09:10.250 --> 02:09:11.800 line:82%
Shut up and listen.

1917
02:09:12.590 --> 02:09:15.880 line:82%
If you don't apologize to me
and my daughter,

1918
02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:21.170 line:82%
I will destroy you and your magazine!

1919
02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:30.840 line:82%
I told you to stay away from him.

1920
02:09:31.710 --> 02:09:32.670 line:82%
But, Mom.

1921
02:09:33.550 --> 02:09:35.460 line:82%
How is this Vikram's fault?

1922
02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.130 line:82%
He hasn't said anything.

1923
02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:39.880 line:82%
Subhana had dreams about it.

1924
02:09:41.170 --> 02:09:43.710 line:82%
If you meet that idiot again,

1925
02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:45.920 line:82%
I'll break your legs.

1926
02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:53.050 line:82%
But you told me you didn't have
a girlfriend.

1927
02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:55.000 line:82%
Sona is not my girlfriend.

1928
02:09:56.250 --> 02:09:57.170 line:82%
She is friend.

1929
02:09:57.590 --> 02:09:58.590 line:82%
Means she was.

1930
02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:01.500 line:82%
Don't lie to me.

1931
02:10:01.630 --> 02:10:03.420 line:82%
What are you doing?
Are you mad?

1932
02:10:03.590 --> 02:10:06.380 line:82%
My first cover story... is this.

1933
02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.920 line:82%
You benefit from this, but did you think
about me?

1934
02:10:10.170 --> 02:10:11.000 line:82%
"Benefit"?

1935
02:10:11.090 --> 02:10:12.050 line:82%
Obviously!

1936
02:10:12.250 --> 02:10:13.420 line:82%
You're crazy.

1937
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:18.250 line:82%
This article is calling me
a ruthless, selfish user!

1938
02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:19.960 line:82%
-And I benefit from it?
-Yes!

1939
02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:22.130 line:82%
A boy from Delhi.

1940
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:23.880 line:82%
Who, till yesterday was a nobody.

1941
02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:28.050 line:82%
An affair with Neena's daughter,
that's something to benefit from.

1942
02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:31.800 line:82%
Mom was right.

1943
02:10:32.250 --> 02:10:33.380 line:82%
You know?

1944
02:10:33.670 --> 02:10:35.960 line:82%
I'm sick of you and I'm sick of your mom.

1945
02:10:36.630 --> 02:10:38.500 line:82%
Instead of listening to her bullshit,

1946
02:10:38.590 --> 02:10:41.880 line:82%
learn how to act first,
you will benefit from it.

1947
02:10:47.170 --> 02:10:48.960 line:82%
How dare you talk to me like this!

1948
02:10:52.750 --> 02:10:53.800 line:82%
Nikki.

1949
02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:55.460 line:82%
Don't you ever call me again!

1950
02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:11.960 line:82%
Can't you respond to my calls?
I even came here to meet you.

1951
02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:15.000 line:82%
Don't you get that
I don't want to talk to you?

1952
02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:20.050 line:82%
You don't want to talk but your desire
to talk to the press is fulfilled.

1953
02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:22.750 line:82%
-What?
-Look at this.

1954
02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:25.670 line:82%
Look at this.

1955
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:29.250 line:82%
Do you think I'm responsible for this?

1956
02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:32.630 line:82%
Who else? It's signed by your friend,
the writer.

1957
02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:35.090 line:82%
How am I responsible if Tanvir wrote it?

1958
02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:39.710 line:82%
Listen, my first film is getting released
and I don't need this shit!

1959
02:11:40.130 --> 02:11:41.170 line:82%
What shit?

1960
02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:43.420 line:82%
Only I know what I have been through.

1961
02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:44.840 line:82%
I worked bloody hard for this!

1962
02:11:45.630 --> 02:11:49.420 line:82%
Why do you want your share
in my chance of getting successful?

1963
02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:52.750 line:82%
If you want your name and photos
in the media,

1964
02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:54.300 line:82%
do something on your own!

1965
02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:07.920 line:82%
You can't gain anything from talking
about me.

1966
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:09.880 line:82%
Do you understand that?

1967
02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:26.460 line:82%
Excuse me?

1968
02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:28.460 line:82%
Excuse me!

1969
02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.380 line:82%
Hi, Sona. Listen...

1970
02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:34.710 line:82%
What is this?

1971
02:12:36.130 --> 02:12:37.210 line:82%
Listen to me.

1972
02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:38.300 line:82%
What's this?

1973
02:12:39.550 --> 02:12:41.130 line:82%
-Hey, listen to me.
-Listen?

1974
02:12:42.250 --> 02:12:43.420 line:82%
What are you doing?

1975
02:12:43.630 --> 02:12:44.590 line:82%
What am I doing?

1976
02:12:57.670 --> 02:13:00.500 line:82%
Look at what's come.

1977
02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:02.170 line:82%
Congratulations!

1978
02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:03.630 line:82%
Sona MIshra?

1979
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.050 line:82%
You filled out
the Gordrej Eon Diwali bumper form,

1980
02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:10.090 line:82%
this frost free refrigerator,

1981
02:13:10.170 --> 02:13:12.300 line:82%
you have won it. Congratulations!

1982
02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:34.500 line:82%
He was right.

1983
02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:40.500 line:82%
To get something in new life.
You need to raise your hand.

1984
02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.380 line:82%
You need to walk tall.

1985
02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:46.340 line:82%
He taught me this.

1986
02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:51.670 line:82%
But I could not thank him.

1987
02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:57.500 line:82%
Because until I could understand that
I need to raise my hand...

1988
02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:00.340 line:82%
he was gone.

1989
02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:03.550 line:82%
Long ago.

1990
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:09.500 line:82%
Cut it.

1991
02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:13.710 line:82%
Is it okay?

1992
02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:16.550 line:82%
You cry while smiling like Meena Kumari.

1993
02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.050 line:82%
I should be thankful for your decision.

1994
02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:23.550 line:82%
Everything happens for a reason.

1995
02:14:24.250 --> 02:14:25.840 line:82%
Use this publicity.

1996
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.710 line:82%
People know your name now.

1997
02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:30.960 line:82%
Raju, you talk rubbish.

1998
02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:33.250 line:82%
You see what I can do now.

1999
02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:36.500 line:82%
I'll change my name if you don't
get popular.

2000
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:41.250 line:82%
All the misfortunes of your devotees

2001
02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:44.210 line:82%
You erased in a moment

2002
02:14:44.590 --> 02:14:48.800 line:82%
Tribute to the Lord of the universe

2003
02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:53.300 line:82%
You are my father, my mother

2004
02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:05.960 line:82%
-How are you?
-Absolutely fine.

2005
02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:09.000 line:82%
How did the audience react?

2006
02:15:09.590 --> 02:15:11.170 line:82%
You see for yourself, madam.

2007
02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:13.630 line:82%
Come on! Let's go.

2008
02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:15.880 line:82%
I'm getting tensed.

2009
02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:28.300 line:82%
It has come along with colors
Evening has brought a tune along

2010
02:15:30.210 --> 02:15:34.750 line:82%
On my lips, today, there's only your name

2011
02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:42.250 line:82%
I drink wine from your eyes by my eyes

2012
02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:49.880 line:82%
I will die for you, erase myself for you
the only job I am left with

2013
02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:12.550 line:82%
Tell me about the collection.

2014
02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:15.630 line:82%
Hail to the Goddess!

2015
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:20.300 line:82%
This was not possible without the goddess
and your blessings.

2016
02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:22.500 line:82%
Is this something to ask for.

2017
02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.340 line:82%
Nikki was a fire in her performance.

2018
02:16:27.630 --> 02:16:30.550 line:82%
Okay, I'll meet you.

2019
02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:34.000 line:82%
What was your Neena saying?

2020
02:16:34.590 --> 02:16:38.210 line:82%
Film is a hit and she considers herself
a superstar.

2021
02:16:39.090 --> 02:16:40.050 line:82%
Now see.

2022
02:16:40.670 --> 02:16:42.960 line:82%
How she'll pull the producers legs now.

2023
02:16:43.670 --> 02:16:45.840 line:82%
You know, she's s crocodile
in a chiffon saree.

2024
02:16:50.050 --> 02:16:52.800 line:82%
A man got stabbed in Jabalpur
for an advance booking.

2025
02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:55.000 line:82%
One got killed.

2026
02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:57.000 line:82%
-Oh God!
-Cheers to that!

2027
02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:59.420 line:82%
The boy's report is fantastic.

2028
02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:01.630 line:82%
Really?

2029
02:17:01.710 --> 02:17:02.670 line:82%
Brother.

2030
02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:05.460 line:82%
I gave you his photos.

2031
02:17:07.130 --> 02:17:09.380 line:82%
Do you remember that Sona Mishra?

2032
02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:12.340 line:82%
She brought the photo saying
he was her cousin.

2033
02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:16.710 line:82%
It's in the papers now, but I already knew
they were having an affair.

2034
02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:18.340 line:82%
Why didn't you tell me?

2035
02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:20.460 line:82%
Remember she came to the studio
that day?

2036
02:17:20.550 --> 02:17:22.550 line:82%
She will get paid for it now.

2037
02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:23.750 line:82%
Casting director.

2038
02:17:25.090 --> 02:17:26.340 line:82%
How people work.

2039
02:17:28.590 --> 02:17:32.300 line:82%
How these photos came in.

2040
02:17:33.710 --> 02:17:35.630 line:82%
His destiny is fantastic.

2041
02:17:38.420 --> 02:17:40.170 line:82%
Luck by chance.

2042
02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:42.710 line:82%
Zaffar!

2043
02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:45.340 line:82%
-Talk to him.
-Now he's also calling.

2044
02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:50.340 line:82%
Zaffar, what a surprise!

2045
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:51.670 line:82%
All are like that.

2046
02:17:52.170 --> 02:17:54.800 line:82%
Yes, the celebration is on.
Very much celebrating.

2047
02:17:58.050 --> 02:17:59.550 line:82%
What's this, mother?

2048
02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:03.800 line:82%
People have sent flowers for you.

2049
02:18:05.630 --> 02:18:09.090 line:82%
Call Vikram back. He called.

2050
02:18:17.130 --> 02:18:18.670 line:82%
You spoke to Vikram?

2051
02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:22.880 line:82%
Yes, the film is a super hit.

2052
02:18:23.630 --> 02:18:25.670 line:82%
Producers want to cast you two together.

2053
02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:27.130 line:82%
Call him.

2054
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.130 line:82%
I can't believe

2055
02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:31.590 line:82%
you're saying this.

2056
02:18:33.090 --> 02:18:37.500 line:82%
You said so much...
And now since he has a hit...

2057
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:40.090 line:82%
What kind of a person are you?

2058
02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:43.000 line:82%
I don't understand you.

2059
02:18:46.090 --> 02:18:47.130 line:82%
You will never.

2060
02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:51.090 line:82%
You've lived a luxurious life.

2061
02:18:52.210 --> 02:18:55.340 line:82%
You didn't live in a single dirty room
with a full family.

2062
02:18:56.210 --> 02:19:00.750 line:82%
Your father didn't hit you when you
were six for acting in a movie.

2063
02:19:04.050 --> 02:19:05.170 line:82%
I was sixteen,

2064
02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:08.130 line:82%
when my mother forced me to sleep
with the producer.

2065
02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:12.920 line:82%
How will you understand?

2066
02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:18.460 line:82%
Call him.

2067
02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:25.960 line:82%
I couldn't have asked for a better poster.

2068
02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:28.250 line:82%
We have great on screen chemistry.

2069
02:19:29.050 --> 02:19:30.340 line:82%
Acting is in my blood.

2070
02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:32.050 line:82%
I'm single.

2071
02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:34.300 line:82%
I've never had a boyfriend.

2072
02:19:35.590 --> 02:19:37.170 line:82%
We're just good friends.

2073
02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:40.210 line:82%
I've given myself three years
to be number one.

2074
02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:42.590 line:82%
Numbers are for accountants.

2075
02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:44.460 line:82%
I'm an actor.

2076
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:47.880 line:82%
I'm really looking forward
to doing some meaningful cinema.

2077
02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:50.340 line:82%
I don't believe in destiny.

2078
02:19:52.460 --> 02:19:53.750 line:82%
I believe in me.

2079
02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:55.630 line:82%
All right!

2080
02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:00.880 line:82%
Oh, God! Look who's here.

2081
02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:02.960 line:82%
I really need to talk to you, man.

2082
02:20:03.130 --> 02:20:04.590 line:82%
Just stay away form me, Tanvir.

2083
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:07.380 line:82%
-No, but let me explain.
-I don't need your explanation.

2084
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:10.130 line:82%
Vikram, it's not about me.
It's about Sona.

2085
02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:15.420 line:82%
Please.

2086
02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:25.050 line:82%
Where are you?

2087
02:20:28.090 --> 02:20:29.250 line:82%
Remembered something.

2088
02:20:30.130 --> 02:20:32.840 line:82%
Now you are a star, you can think
of anything.

2089
02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:34.710 line:82%
Just don't forget us.

2090
02:20:37.170 --> 02:20:38.300 line:82%
Who are you?

2091
02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:46.500 line:82%
Vikram?

2092
02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:09.420 line:82%
Hello, sir.

2093
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:12.800 line:82%
Congratulations!

2094
02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:14.920 line:82%
I've been hearing very good things
about you.

2095
02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:16.590 line:82%
Thank you so much.

2096
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:20.050 line:82%
Come have a drink with us. Come on.

2097
02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:23.840 line:82%
Your real work starts now.

2098
02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:26.050 line:82%
And actors work apart from acting.

2099
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:29.750 line:82%
It's really to choose
the right kind of roles.

2100
02:21:30.250 --> 02:21:33.170 line:82%
You think your first film chose you.

2101
02:21:34.210 --> 02:21:37.380 line:82%
Now you will choose your films.

2102
02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:39.210 line:82%
You.

2103
02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:42.840 line:82%
Vikram?

2104
02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:47.380 line:82%
Your friends?

2105
02:21:48.210 --> 02:21:52.050 line:82%
Yes, Abhi was with me in school.

2106
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:54.710 line:82%
And that's Sameer.

2107
02:21:57.250 --> 02:21:58.250 line:82%
Won't you go?

2108
02:21:58.840 --> 02:21:59.880 line:82%
No.

2109
02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:03.550 line:82%
Vikram!

2110
02:22:04.460 --> 02:22:05.750 line:82%
Stardom is a cocktail.

2111
02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:09.550 line:82%
Fame, power, money.

2112
02:22:11.170 --> 02:22:12.380 line:82%
Dangerous addictions.

2113
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:17.130 line:82%
I can't even imagine
what it must be like for you.

2114
02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:19.840 line:82%
Yeah? It's insane.

2115
02:22:23.380 --> 02:22:25.130 line:82%
But I understood one thing early,

2116
02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:27.500 line:82%
don't forget,

2117
02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.630 line:82%
they knew you when you were nothing.

2118
02:22:32.380 --> 02:22:35.840 line:82%
Because they are the one who speak
the truth every time.

2119
02:22:38.670 --> 02:22:41.800 line:82%
Like they knew you will be here,
and so they left.

2120
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:46.250 line:82%
You must have faced this in school.

2121
02:23:09.130 --> 02:23:10.880 line:82%
-Listen to me.
-I don't want to.

2122
02:23:12.250 --> 02:23:16.090 line:82%
I've decided that Sulochana will not
live in this house anymore.

2123
02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:18.960 line:82%
Listen to me.

2124
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:21.880 line:82%
Whatever feelings you have for Sulochana,

2125
02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:26.090 line:82%
I can say that she never broke the rules
of this family,

2126
02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:27.960 line:82%
Sulochana never broke them.

2127
02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:31.300 line:82%
Cut it. Once more.

2128
02:23:45.170 --> 02:23:46.420 line:82%
What is a big star doing here?

2129
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:58.710 line:82%
I met Tanvir.

2130
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.050 line:82%
I'm sorry.

2131
02:24:12.090 --> 02:24:14.130 line:82%
I ruined everything, Sona.

2132
02:24:18.420 --> 02:24:19.460 line:82%
With Nikki...

2133
02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:28.670 line:82%
The thing that happened
with Nikki in Nikhari.

2134
02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:33.380 line:82%
I made a mistake.

2135
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.380 line:82%
You surprised me.

2136
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:43.250 line:82%
I didn't know how to face you.

2137
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:45.880 line:82%
I started lying.

2138
02:24:48.130 --> 02:24:49.550 line:82%
I'm so sorry.

2139
02:24:52.090 --> 02:24:53.250 line:82%
What do you want now?

2140
02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:56.800 line:82%
I just keep thinking about you.

2141
02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:03.130 line:82%
How can I forget the way you were with me.

2142
02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:08.590 line:82%
You believed in me so much,

2143
02:25:10.090 --> 02:25:11.460 line:82%
even when my family didn't.

2144
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:18.130 line:82%
It's only with you that...

2145
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:20.300 line:82%
I could really be myself.

2146
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:25.380 line:82%
Without any fear of judgment.

2147
02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:33.460 line:82%
I needed support and you were there.

2148
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:41.880 line:82%
I miss you.

2149
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:55.170 line:82%
You don't trust me.

2150
02:25:57.090 --> 02:25:58.460 line:82%
It's not that, Vikram.

2151
02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:01.130 line:82%
I know you are saying truth.

2152
02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:04.710 line:82%
Because you are selfish.

2153
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:09.550 line:82%
I was listening to you carefully.

2154
02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:12.800 line:82%
How I was a part of your life.

2155
02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:14.960 line:82%
How I was with you.

2156
02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:18.880 line:82%
How I can still be your support.

2157
02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:21.340 line:82%
Yours... for you...

2158
02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:25.340 line:82%
This is about you, Vikram.

2159
02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:30.210 line:82%
Where am I in all this? Tell me.

2160
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:36.130 line:82%
Today you are felling guilty.

2161
02:26:37.090 --> 02:26:38.340 line:82%
That's why you're here.

2162
02:26:40.750 --> 02:26:45.250 line:82%
If something interesting comes up,
you will leave me again.

2163
02:27:07.090 --> 02:27:08.550 line:82%
This is no fault of yours.

2164
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.550 line:82%
What can you do?

2165
02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:16.750 line:82%
That's who you are.

2166
02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:35.630 line:82%
Your series is very popular.

2167
02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:38.550 line:82%
And you are getting praised.

2168
02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:42.250 line:82%
My magazine wants to know more about you.

2169
02:27:43.090 --> 02:27:45.380 line:82%
Where is your family?

2170
02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:48.840 line:82%
In Kanpur, my parents are from there.

2171
02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:52.590 line:82%
My sisters Tara and Megha
are both married.

2172
02:27:53.210 --> 02:27:55.000 line:82%
One in Delhi and the other in Dehradun.

2173
02:27:56.090 --> 02:28:01.050 line:82%
How did your parents react when you
wanted to get into films and acting?

2174
02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:09.710 line:82%
I just ran away.

2175
02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:13.710 line:82%
People were talking for two years

2176
02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:16.380 line:82%
about accountant Mishra's girl
leaving the house.

2177
02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:21.340 line:82%
Another scandal happened
and I was forgotten.

2178
02:28:22.210 --> 02:28:25.380 line:82%
Since that day I haven't spoken
to my parents.

2179
02:28:27.050 --> 02:28:28.630 line:82%
Sometimes I talk to Megha.

2180
02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:32.380 line:82%
She said things are getting better now.

2181
02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:34.750 line:82%
They watch me on TV.

2182
02:28:35.710 --> 02:28:38.210 line:82%
Every thing will be okay between us.

2183
02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:42.590 line:82%
May be they will realize one day,

2184
02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:45.750 line:82%
that I am the only girl in the family
who is independent.

2185
02:28:46.170 --> 02:28:48.750 line:82%
They wanted to get me married to someone.

2186
02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:51.840 line:82%
He belonged to my caste.

2187
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.920 line:82%
But here no one asks for caste.

2188
02:28:55.050 --> 02:28:58.300 line:82%
You know your job and you have a road
to travel.

2189
02:28:59.090 --> 02:29:01.170 line:82%
Yes, nothing is achieved with ease.

2190
02:29:02.250 --> 02:29:05.300 line:82%
Sometimes I felt it was better to be out.

2191
02:29:06.210 --> 02:29:09.590 line:82%
I do feel lonely and sad.

2192
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:14.000 line:82%
But I have a feeling of belonging.

2193
02:29:16.210 --> 02:29:18.840 line:82%
I don't work everyday,

2194
02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:21.800 line:82%
but I do something I like
and it makes me happy.

2195
02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:24.960 line:82%
How many people can say this?

2196
02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:32.090 line:82%
I can be sad that I'm not
a big film star.

2197
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:36.000 line:82%
Or feel happy that I'm an actress.

2198
02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:39.960 line:82%
Who is working and earning money.

2199
02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:42.800 line:82%
I've decided to be happy.

2200
02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:51.550 line:82%
Somebody once told me,

2201
02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:55.130 line:82%
a person chooses his own failure
and success.

2202
02:29:55.800 --> 02:29:56.710 line:82%
Film City.

2203
02:29:58.170 --> 02:30:00.250 line:82%
I have understood this now.

2204
02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:04.340 line:82%
The paths

2205
02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:08.880 line:82%
Have risen

2206
02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:14.340 line:82%
Seeking only for you

2207
02:30:26.340 --> 02:30:29.460 line:82%
Your life

2208
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:35.380 line:82%
Every moment

2209
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:41.250 line:82%
At every step

2210
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:45.750 line:82%
Asks

2211
02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:52.710 line:82%
What are you looking at, seeker?

2212
02:30:53.250 --> 02:30:57.800 line:82%
Every direction and path

2213
02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:04.670 line:82%
Tells you which is your path

2214
02:31:04.750 --> 02:31:07.250 line:82%
O, seeker

2215
02:31:07.380 --> 02:31:11.340 line:82%
Nobody knows it

2216
02:31:13.210 --> 02:31:17.800 line:82%
O, seeker

2217
02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:22.300 line:82%
Tell me where you're going?

2218
02:31:34.750 --> 02:31:38.960 line:82%
There is a path of thorns
And flowers ahead

2219
02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:44.750 line:82%
It's up to you to choose the path

2220
02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:50.380 line:82%
Consider that path by forgetting
The other one

2221
02:31:50.920 --> 02:31:55.460 line:82%
You have your heart to listen to

2222
02:31:56.500 --> 02:32:00.300 line:82%
And make your decision

2223
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:05.670 line:82%
To either forget or remember it

2224
02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:12.000 line:82%
Whichever path you choose

2225
02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:18.250 line:82%
Traveler, no one knows

2226
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:25.000 line:82%
O traveler, O traveler

2227
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:30.380 line:82%
Tell us where are you going

2228
02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:52.630 line:82%
You can get a favor from society

2229
02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:58.170 line:82%
But tell me, do you want
To live like this?

2230
02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:03.130 line:82%
You will get freedom
From your achievements

2231
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:08.750 line:82%
Tell me what are you afraid of?

2232
02:33:09.630 --> 02:33:13.090 line:82%
It will be your decision

2233
02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:19.380 line:82%
To choose from

2234
02:33:20.250 --> 02:33:24.840 line:82%
An easy or independent path

2235
02:33:25.090 --> 02:33:30.210 line:82%
Traveler, nobody knows

2236
02:33:33.340 --> 02:33:38.250 line:82%
Traveler, o, traveler

2237
02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:43.170 line:82%
Tell us where are you going

2238
02:33:44.210 --> 02:33:49.170 line:82%
Traveler, o, traveler

2239
02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:53.670 line:82%
No one knows

2240
02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:00.000 line:82%
Traveler, o, traveler

2241
02:34:00.130 --> 02:34:04.500 line:82%
Tell me where are you going?

2242
02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:24.590 line:82%
The sun is peeing out from my window

2243
02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:28.710 line:82%
Like the rays have found their path

2244
02:34:29.670 --> 02:34:33.340 line:82%
They have come while smiling

2245
02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:42.630 line:82%
Don't know what is all this

2246
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:47.300 line:82%
Whatever it is, it is fresh and new

2247
02:34:48.250 --> 02:34:51.210 line:82%
I have lost my heart

2248
02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:55.500 line:82%
Today what has happened

2249
02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:11.750 line:82%
The world is about to change

2250
02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:16.460 line:82%
Life is about to transform
I don't know why I felt it

2251
02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:20.170 line:82%
My heart feels so

2252
02:35:20.460 --> 02:35:25.920 line:82%
New buds are about to blossom
Birds come near to sing

2253
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:30.880 line:82%
Don't know what this is
