Kingpin Logistics.

3
00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:02.417 line:83%
Simon, under this company's name...

4
00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:05.750 line:83%
...has leased the entire port
for 99 years from the Government.

5
00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:12.708 line:83%
His company has 14,000 staff members
working from top to bottom.

6
00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:14.917 line:83%
They conduct a thorough security check,

7
00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.875 line:83%
confiscate employees' phones,
and then allow entry.

8
00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:18.167 line:83%
It's because...

9
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.667 line:83%
Under the pretense of logistics,

10
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.083 line:83%
they're importing and exporting
gold and electronics.

11
00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:25.708 line:83%
Their primary imported products
are watches.

12
00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:27.167 line:83%
Luxury watches.

13
00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:29.583 line:83%
Their value surpasses
that of gold and diamonds.

14
00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:30.708 line:83%
But low-risk business.

15
00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:35.458 line:83%
They perform health check-ups
for employees who are newly appointed.

16
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.125 line:83%
Until now, I have no idea why
they conduct health check-ups--

17
00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:39.875 line:83%
It's not for the record.

18
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.542 line:83%
It's only for internal purposes.
Keep talking.

19
00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.917 line:83%
Sir, as far as I've observed...

20
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.292 line:83%
Aiyappan is in charge of loading,
unloading, and handling money.

21
00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:52.417 line:83%
Karthi manages the labourers.

22
00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.292 line:83%
Saravanan handles transportation
and miscellaneous.

23
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.750 line:83%
-Their head of operations is--
-One minute!

24
00:02:58.375 --> 00:02:58.958 line:83%
Stop recording.

25
00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:00.125 line:83%
It sounds about right.

26
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.750 line:83%
Eight years ago,
a constable went undercover.

27
00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:06.042 line:83%
For a year,
he passed on information diligently.

28
00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:08.500 line:83%
After that, we have no idea
what happened to him.

29
00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:09.792 line:83%
Later, that team was dismantled too.

30
00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.792 line:83%
First, find him, and we'll get
all the necessary information.

31
00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.542 line:83%
There's a person named Dayalan at the port.

32
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.167 line:83%
If what you're saying is true,

33
00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:21.500 line:83%
then it's highly unlikely
someone could be alive.

34
00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:23.875 line:83%
Dayal!

35
00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:27.042 line:83%
After Simon, he's the first in command
and manages the entire port.

36
00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:38.333 line:83%
If he thinks anyone is trouble
for the business,

37
00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:40.500 line:83%
he'll eliminate them without hesitation.

38
00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:44.042 line:83%
You can't even find any trace of it.

39
00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:46.708 line:83%
All these years,

40
00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:49.667 line:83%
there has been no competition
for him or Simon's business.

41
00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:54.500 line:83%
In just a year and a half,
I'm all worn out, sir.

42
00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:57.500 line:83%
There's no way anyone has been
an informer for the past eight years.

43
00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:10.250 line:83%
-Do you know what it's worth?
-I don't know.

44
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:10.958 line:83%
It's worth two crores.

45
00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.000 line:83%
How dare you shove it in your back?
Shove it in the front.

46
00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:13.542 line:83%
Sorry, brother.

47
00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:16.792 line:83%
Come. Come on. Come.

48
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.833 line:83%
Brother, brother, brother.
I'm sorry, brother.

49
00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:21.958 line:83%
Brother, brother, brother...

50
00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:25.292 line:83%
I couldn't gather
much information about Simon.

51
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.583 line:83%
He seldom visits the port.

52
00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:30.792 line:83%
His son, Arjun, is a Customs Officer.

53
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.375 line:83%
I reckon he's not that interested
in his father's business.

54
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.042 line:83%
But he helps them smoothly
without Government interference.

55
00:04:44.292 --> 00:04:47.250 line:83%
I don't think their growth is
solely due to this network.

56
00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:50.167 line:83%
They're running something huge
in the background.

57
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.750 line:83%
If we wish to know about it...

58
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.000 line:83%
...we must have access
to the restricted area.

59
00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:56.792 line:83%
This is all the information I could
gather in a year and a half.

60
00:04:57.292 --> 00:04:59.042 line:83%
It's been a year
since I met my family.

61
00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:01.042 line:83%
It'll be great if you could
relieve me at the earliest.

62
00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:03.292 line:83%
-You may leave. I'll keep you posted.
-Okay, sir.

63
00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:07.083 line:83%
-Hey, Palanisamy.
-Yes, sir.

64
00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:08.875 line:83%
Be safe.

65
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.250 line:83%
Also, if you find anything about Informer,
contact us.

66
00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:12.042 line:83%
Sure, sir!

67
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.542 line:83%
-Did Arjun come over?
-I don't think so, sir.

68
00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:22.708 line:83%
-They got a tip about the informer.
-Is it?

69
00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:23.875 line:83%
Stay alert.

70
00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:26.208 line:83%
Sir, please don't call me anymore.
If there's anything, I'll call you.

71
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.667 line:83%
-Any update on the documents?
-We'll talk about it later. Hang up.

72
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.208 line:83%
Hey, stop!

73
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.375 line:83%
-Sir, good morning.
-Hmm.

74
00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:45.875 line:83%
The Nashik shipment is arriving.

75
00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:47.125 line:83%
Shut down Terminal-4.

76
00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:51.667 line:83%
Brother, Arjun, sir, is here.

77
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.542 line:83%
-Hello, Arjun, sir.
-Welcome, sir.

78
00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:56.167 line:83%
-Where is Dayal?
-Dayal is eating inside.

79
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.958 line:83%
Operation department.

80
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.958 line:83%
Operation department!

Coolie No: 837

82
00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:36.375 line:83%
COOLIE NO: 837

83
00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:44.167 line:83%
It's me, sir.

84
00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:51.083 line:83%
Sir.

85
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:01.417 line:83%
Catch!

86
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.583 line:83%
I did nothing--

87
00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:06.542 line:83%
-I did not do anything, sir.
-Come with me.

88
00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.375 line:83%
I did not do anything, sir.

89
00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:15.750 line:83%
Sir, I did not make any mistake.

90
00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.500 line:83%
Sir, everyone's looking.
Please let go of me.

91
00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:18.750 line:83%
Sir, I did nothing.

92
00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:25.750 line:83%
Sir, I did nothing.

93
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.125 line:83%
I did not make any mistake.

94
00:07:27.917 --> 00:07:29.833 line:83%
I won't ask you anything.
Come clean.

95
00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:34.708 line:83%
Sir, I don't get you.
I did nothing.

96
00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:36.083 line:83%
You don't get me?

97
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:38.875 line:83%
-Now, you'll get me.
-He's on the phone.

98
00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:45.000 line:83%
Listen!
Listen, who are these people?

99
00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:47.375 line:83%
-I'm petrified.
-Mom.

100
00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:50.542 line:83%
-Mom!
-Why are they here?

101
00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.375 line:83%
Sir, I don't know who they are.

102
00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:54.875 line:83%
He doesn't know them.

103
00:07:55.583 --> 00:07:57.042 line:83%
-Kill them both.
-Take your hands off me.

104
00:07:57.375 --> 00:08:00.167 line:83%
Hey! Hey! Let go of my daughter.

105
00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.125 line:83%
-Oh, no, what's happening?
-Dhana!

106
00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:05.208 line:83%
Dhana, don't be afraid.
They can't harm you.

107
00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:06.833 line:83%
Take care of our daughter.

108
00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:08.000 line:83%
-Dhana!
-Where are you?

109
00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:09.167 line:83%
Hey, please don't harm her.

110
00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:11.167 line:83%
-Oh, no, please don't.
-Don't harm them.

111
00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:13.292 line:83%
Dhana, don't be afraid.

112
00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:14.583 line:83%
They won't harm you.

113
00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:15.417 line:83%
[knife slashing]

114
00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:16.375 line:83%
-Mom!
-Dhana!

115
00:08:17.542 --> 00:08:18.208 line:83%
Kuttimaa!

116
00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:39.125 line:83%
Take a look.

117
00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:41.250 line:83%
True identity is coming out.

118
00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.167 line:83%
The Police in him is coming out.

119
00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:55.625 line:83%
I'll show what the consequences are
when the Police infiltrate.

120
00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:33.208 line:83%
I want to clarify something for everyone.

121
00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.792 line:83%
Another rat like him
from the Police is still among us.

122
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.500 line:83%
The rat won't reveal itself.

123
00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:42.542 line:83%
But if you figure out
who's the rat among you...

124
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.417 line:83%
...and bring him to me...

125
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.292 line:83%
Hey, pull up the board.

126
00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.333 line:83%
Among the 14,400 employees...

127
00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:31.083 line:83%
...the reward for the one labourer
I'm looking for.

128
00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:17.750 line:83%
CHENNAI

129
00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:20.042 line:83%
Yeah!

130
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.458 line:83%
Hey, we found it.

131
00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:24.792 line:83%
Is it the mansion where boys
are decorating it with flowers?

132
00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:25.667 line:83%
Hang up!
We're coming inside.

133
00:11:37.417 --> 00:11:38.750 line:83%
They're from my hometown.

134
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.750 line:83%
-Welcome!
-Please guide them.

135
00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.083 line:83%
What's your purpose of visit?

136
00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:45.375 line:83%
We're preparing for UPSC exams.
We need a room to stay in.

137
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.083 line:83%
Room?

138
00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:51.583 line:83%
For others,
the rent is 2500 rupees per month.

139
00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:54.667 line:83%
However, for students,
the cost is 750 rupees per month.

140
00:11:54.792 --> 00:11:56.417 line:83%
It includes three free meals daily.

141
00:11:56.667 --> 00:11:58.250 line:83%
Solely because of Brother's order.

142
00:11:58.375 --> 00:11:59.000 line:83%
Okay?

143
00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:01.583 line:83%
750 per month sounds cheap.

144
00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:03.542 line:83%
Rent is cheap.

145
00:12:04.042 --> 00:12:06.583 line:83%
First, read the rules listed on the board,
and then we'll discuss.

146
00:12:08.708 --> 00:12:12.333 line:83%
-No liquor.
-No mixing liquor in cold drink bottles.

147
00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:15.708 line:83%
Hey, who's that staggering?
Stop and check him.

148
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.708 line:83%
Dude, they're using
a breathalyzer to check.

149
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.667 line:83%
Whack him and make him sleep
outside the mansion.

150
00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:24.333 line:83%
Okay, brother. Hey, get out!

151
00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:25.208 line:83%
-Brother!
-Yes, tell me.

152
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.000 line:83%
Isn't it a Mansion?
But the rules are like a hostel.

153
00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:30.000 line:83%
It's hostel in the pretense of Mansion.

154
00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:32.292 line:83%
Drinking is not permitted
according to the rules.

155
00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:32.958 line:83%
Okay?

156
00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:37.917 line:83%
You must wonder why the
mansion looks celebratory.

157
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.042 line:83%
Is it your wedding?

158
00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:40.167 line:83%
Don't remind me of my marriage.

159
00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:41.292 line:83%
Today is Mansion Day.

160
00:12:41.792 --> 00:12:42.708 line:83%
-Hello, Dinesh.
-Morning, brother.

161
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.625 line:83%
His brother, Ganesh, works for Sun Music.

162
00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:46.708 line:83%
Even if you wake at midnight and
request a song, he'll play it for you.

163
00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.042 line:83%
They're all Brother's friends.

164
00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:51.208 line:83%
Ensure that you show them respect.

165
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000 line:83%
Brother has control of the TV
in the mansion.

166
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.667 line:83%
He picks the song.

167
00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:58.917 line:83%
That song will be the only one
played throughout the mansion.

168
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.875 line:83%
Your room is the last one on this side.

169
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.292 line:83%
In the morning, I will assign
a room downstairs to one of you.

170
00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:07.167 line:83%
Hey, shush!

171
00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:08.958 line:83%
What happened?

172
00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:11.833 line:83%
Listen closely.

173
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.292 line:83%
Don't approach or make noise
near this room.

174
00:13:14.917 --> 00:13:16.750 line:83%
-Who stays in this room?
-Shut up, you moron!

175
00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:18.292 line:83%
Come on. Walk silently.

176
00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:19.500 line:83%
Slow, slow, slow.

177
00:13:23.667 --> 00:13:25.458 line:83%
Hey, moron, move it.

178
00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.375 line:83%
Hey, look, the vintage phone.

179
00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:41.833 line:83%
-Hey, put the phone down.
-Why?

180
00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:42.750 line:83%
Step back.

181
00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:44.958 line:83%
You're not allowed to touch this phone

182
00:13:45.333 --> 00:13:48.458 line:83%
Neither you nor anyone else should make
a call or have someone call you on this.

183
00:13:48.792 --> 00:13:50.208 line:83%
Because it's Brother's personal number.

184
00:13:50.708 --> 00:13:52.417 line:83%
Understand?
This is your last warning.

185
00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:53.333 line:83%
Leave now!

186
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:54.583 line:83%
Go!

187
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.750 line:83%
They're acting as if it's AI technology.

188
00:13:56.875 --> 00:14:00.167 line:83%
-Hey, what's the problem?
-As far as I know, no one will work today.

189
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.083 line:83%
-Why?
-Everyone is in a different mood.

190
00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:04.417 line:83%
I understood.

191
00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:08.458 line:83%
Have all of you planned to drink today?

192
00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:12.917 line:83%
You're expecting me to go to
Brother and ask for permission...

193
00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.000 line:83%
...and get kicked out of the mansion.

194
00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:16.417 line:83%
Isn't that what you all are wishing for?

195
00:14:17.042 --> 00:14:20.083 line:83%
Varma, aren't you with him
since he founded this mansion?

196
00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:23.625 line:83%
Don't you know
that he quit drinking 30 years ago?

197
00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.625 line:83%
But he used to drink before that, right?

198
00:14:26.083 --> 00:14:28.500 line:83%
Oh, you're making a point,
aren't you?

199
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.875 line:83%
We don't drink all year.
Why not just today?

200
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.417 line:83%
Hey! Everybody!

201
00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:41.667 line:83%
Poun, are you the one
instigating these guys?

202
00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:44.208 line:83%
Fine, let's all go and ask for permission.

203
00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.208 line:83%
-Let's go.
-Don't know if he's in a good mood or not.

204
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.625 line:83%
Why are you making me the scapegoat?

205
00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:00.917 line:83%
Brother!

206
00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:05.792 line:83%
Yes, Kumar.

207
00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:07.750 line:83%
Today is Mansion Day.

208
00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:10.000 line:83%
I know, it's Mansion Day.

209
00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:11.375 line:83%
Decorations are done.

210
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.375 line:83%
I'm aware of the decorations.

211
00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:18.292 line:83%
Also, we're preparing Briyani
for the feast.

212
00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:20.625 line:83%
Okay. What about it?

213
00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:25.583 line:83%
Boys feel before the feast
if they can have some medicament

214
00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.292 line:83%
it'll be fun!

215
00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:29.708 line:83%
Medicament?

216
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.625 line:83%
Is someone not well, Kumar?

217
00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:37.542 line:83%
You guys spoke so much earlier.
Why is everyone silent now?

218
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.417 line:83%
It doesn't sound like a request
from them, Kumar.

219
00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:03.292 line:83%
Brother, you know
that I'm a teetotaler.

220
00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:04.458 line:83%
Oh, yeah!

221
00:16:07.417 --> 00:16:09.000 line:83%
Fine, make arrangements.

222
00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:11.000 line:83%
Hey, Brother has agreed to it.

223
00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:13.333 line:83%
Everyone,
make a list of what you want.

224
00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:15.083 line:83%
Hey, it's a dry day today.
Liquor won't be available.

225
00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:17.083 line:83%
Brother, it's a dry day today.

226
00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:18.750 line:83%
Had we known,
we could've bought it yesterday.

227
00:16:18.792 --> 00:16:20.500 line:83%
It's a pity!

228
00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:22.708 line:83%
Damn, what do we do now?

229
00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:28.250 line:83%
Whoever has hidden liquor without
my knowledge, raise your hands.

230
00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:31.708 line:83%
It's Mansion Day today.

231
00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:34.375 line:83%
Everyone should be happy.
I won't mind.

232
00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:35.875 line:83%
Don't worry, raise your hands.

233
00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:39.000 line:83%
Brother, no one can even smuggle
a drop without my knowledge.

234
00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.292 line:83%
Please turn around, my dear.

235
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.792 line:83%
If you consume
all the hidden stash yourself...

236
00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.125 line:83%
...the others will get upset.

237
00:16:53.292 --> 00:16:54.667 line:83%
-Am I right, Kumar?
-You're right!

238
00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:58.292 line:83%
Bring out all the liquor
and pour it in a drum...

239
00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:00.167 line:83%
-What "tail" do they call it?
-Cocktail!

240
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.042 line:83%
It's delicious.

241
00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:02.208 line:83%
-Teetotaler, you say?
-Oh, no!

242
00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:06.167 line:83%
If you have a cocktail,
it'll give you the high.

243
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.667 line:83%
Get it ready in ten minutes.

244
00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:10.500 line:83%
I'll get ready, too. Okay.

245
00:17:11.042 --> 00:17:13.625 line:83%
Everyone,
let's make the mansion high today.

246
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.708 line:83%
-Ganesh!
-Yes, Thalaivar.

247
00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:17.042 line:83%
-Today is Mansion Day.
-I know.

248
00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:18.292 line:83%
For the next half an hour...

249
00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:19.458 line:83%
I hope you understand.

250
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.000 line:83%

00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:04.042 line:83%
You don't have to pay your respects.
Please get out.

319
00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:06.167 line:83%
Why are you creating a scene
at the funeral?

320
00:23:06.208 --> 00:23:08.167 line:83%
Please don't say anything.
And please take him away.

321
00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:10.417 line:83%
[in Telugu] What is the problem?
Who is he?

322
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.250 line:83%
It's nothing.
You don't worry.

323
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.417 line:83%

Come on, Brother.

328
00:24:06.708 --> 00:24:10.042 line:83%
It's a funeral, and she's yelling
at you without basic decency.

329
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.708 line:83%
Is he an important person?

330
00:24:15.083 --> 00:24:16.292 line:83%

Before I could make it,
you cremated him.

340
00:25:45.292 --> 00:25:46.333 line:83%
Oh, God!

341
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.292 line:83%
We've seen many turn into smoke.

342
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.250 line:83%
Oh, no!

343
00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:09.583 line:83%
Five years ago, his files were closed.

344
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.292 line:83%
After that,
we don't have any records of him.

345
00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:13.417 line:83%
In fact, he abruptly resigned
from his job.

346
00:26:14.375 --> 00:26:16.792 line:83%
Do you have any details about
his employment after quitting here?

347
00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.458 line:83%
Sir, you will have to ask
his family about it.

348
00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:30.625 line:83%
This is Rajashekar's
original autopsy report.

349
00:26:35.458 --> 00:26:37.583 line:83%
Dayal, if another body washes up
on the shore,

350
00:26:37.792 --> 00:26:39.083 line:83%
other departments will start
hunting you guys down.

351
00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:40.417 line:83%
Things will go out of control.

352
00:26:40.917 --> 00:26:41.750 line:83%
I will handle it.

353
00:26:42.042 --> 00:26:44.208 line:83%
Why did you stop disposing of bodies
like you used to?

354
00:26:44.375 --> 00:26:46.125 line:83%
Don't make me call you again.

355
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.417 line:83%
Sir! Sir! I'm Priya's elder sister.
I came to pay the fees.

356
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.375 line:83%
I was told that, as she defaulted on fees,
you withheld her hall ticket.

357
00:26:57.417 --> 00:26:58.292 line:83%
So, I'm here to pay the fees.

358
00:26:58.333 --> 00:26:59.208 line:83%
One minute.

359
00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:02.083 line:83%
They've issued her the hall ticket.

360
00:27:02.417 --> 00:27:04.458 line:83%
Only now has someone
paid her fees in full.

361
00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:06.167 line:83%
May I know who paid the fees?

362
00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:07.625 line:83%
He claimed
he's a friend of your Father.

363
00:27:07.792 --> 00:27:09.167 line:83%
Don't you people have any sense?

364
00:27:09.792 --> 00:27:11.500 line:83%
You'll accept payment from anyone.

365
00:27:14.208 --> 00:27:15.792 line:83%
Hello! Hello, sir!

366
00:27:16.375 --> 00:27:17.542 line:83%
What do you think of yourself?

367
00:27:17.792 --> 00:27:19.458 line:83%
We never asked you for a favor.

368
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.708 line:83%
You've been following me everywhere.

369
00:27:20.792 --> 00:27:23.125 line:83%
Please don't put on
this sympathy act with me.

370
00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:24.958 line:83%
Please calm down.

371
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.083 line:83%
I paid the fees.

372
00:27:26.208 --> 00:27:27.625 line:83%
I'm paying back what I owe your father.

373
00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:29.333 line:83%
He has helped me a lot.

374
00:27:29.417 --> 00:27:31.292 line:83%
I paid the fee because you're
struggling to make ends meet.

375
00:27:31.417 --> 00:27:32.750 line:83%
This is the best I could do.

376
00:27:36.958 --> 00:27:39.000 line:83%
May I speak with you in private
for two minutes?

377
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.458 line:83%
Do you have a soft copy
of your father's autopsy report?

378
00:27:44.083 --> 00:27:44.583 line:83%
Yeah.

379
00:27:51.667 --> 00:27:53.708 line:83%
-What is it?
-Do you spot a difference?

380
00:27:56.292 --> 00:27:56.917 line:83%
Yes.

381
00:27:57.292 --> 00:28:00.000 line:83%
The soft copy states
that your father died of a cardiac arrest.

382
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.292 line:83%
That's a lie.

383
00:28:01.375 --> 00:28:03.542 line:83%
He was punched in the chest hard,
which caused his death.

384
00:28:03.917 --> 00:28:06.458 line:83%
It was not a natural death.
Someone murdered your father.

385
00:28:06.833 --> 00:28:09.042 line:83%
What's the assurance the people who
killed your father won't come after you?

386
00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:10.958 line:83%
That's why
I'm always around you people.

387
00:28:11.792 --> 00:28:13.375 line:83%
Just the daughters, right?

388
00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:16.250 line:83%
Those people shouldn't assume
that no one is there for you guys.

389
00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:17.500 line:83%
Someone should be there to question them.

390
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.750 line:83%
-That's why...
-Okay.

391
00:28:21.042 --> 00:28:22.542 line:83%
What do you suggest we do now?

392
00:28:23.042 --> 00:28:26.292 line:83%
You want me and my sisters
to abandon everything...

393
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.500 line:83%
...and come along with you,
find them and seek revenge?

394
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:31.250 line:83%
Will that bring back my father
from the dead?

395
00:28:32.167 --> 00:28:33.458 line:83%
There's no way he'll return.

396
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.208 line:83%
Is seeking revenge
or living our lives important?

397
00:28:37.583 --> 00:28:39.583 line:83%
To us, living our lives
is all that matters.

398
00:28:39.917 --> 00:28:42.583 line:83%
So, I suggest you drop this matter
right here.

399
00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:47.458 line:83%
Super!

400
00:28:50.875 --> 00:28:52.833 line:83%
I won't spare his killer.

401
00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:55.167 line:83%
He may be your father.

402
00:28:55.583 --> 00:28:57.083 line:83%
But he is my friend!

403
00:28:59.917 --> 00:29:00.417 line:83%
Let's go!

404
00:29:08.708 --> 00:29:10.125 line:83%
[in Telugu] What is it?
No need.

405
00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:15.708 line:83%
Hey, here's the chickpeas you asked for.

406
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.458 line:83%
-At least, tell me now.
-Dr. Rajashekar?

407
00:29:18.667 --> 00:29:20.958 line:83%
-Or Robert Rajashekar?
-Did he say anything?

408
00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:23.417 line:83%
-He's been repeating himself.
-Or is it R.D. Rajashekar?

409
00:29:23.625 --> 00:29:24.542 line:83%
Phew!

410
00:29:34.167 --> 00:29:36.042 line:83%
Deceased Rajashekar is my best friend.

411
00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:38.917 line:83%
We came to you
to find out how he died.

412
00:29:39.625 --> 00:29:40.833 line:83%
If you know anything, tell me.

413
00:29:41.583 --> 00:29:43.208 line:83%
If you don't know,
then drink till you die.

414
00:29:46.583 --> 00:29:48.708 line:83%
How long have you guys been friends?

415
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:57.083 line:83%
So, you're Deva.
He has spoken to me about you.

416
00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:58.708 line:83%
I'll tell you what I know.

417
00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:00.583 line:83%
See if it helps you.

418
00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:23.625 line:83%
For the five years,
this has been Rajashekar's office.

419
00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:25.667 line:83%
Like everyone else...

420
00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:30.458 line:83%
He, too, was busy with his family and work.

421
00:30:33.917 --> 00:30:35.667 line:83%
Until he invented this thing.

422
00:30:38.417 --> 00:30:41.917 line:83%
To fulfill his daughters dream
of becoming a doctor,

423
00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:43.583 line:83%
he needed a lot of money.

424
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.333 line:83%
He quit his job
at the research company...

425
00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:50.667 line:83%
...and started developing
the Mobile Cremator.

426
00:30:51.167 --> 00:30:54.792 line:83%
He imported
the electrical items required...

427
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:57.042 line:83%
...and created the prototype of this chair.

428
00:30:57.708 --> 00:31:02.792 line:83%
He believed if the Government approves
his project, it'll change his life.

429
00:31:11.667 --> 00:31:12.875 line:83%
This is the Mobile Cremator.

430
00:31:13.292 --> 00:31:15.167 line:83%
The cremation process of this device:

431
00:31:15.333 --> 00:31:17.667 line:83%
At 1650 degree celsius

432
00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:20.792 line:83%
the flesh will vaporize
and only bones will remain.

433
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.208 line:83%
You can cremate a body in just 30 seconds.

434
00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:25.917 line:83%
If we bring this Mobile Cremator
into production...

435
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.833 line:83%
we can prevent pollution that's caused
by the traditional cremator.

436
00:31:29.208 --> 00:31:32.500 line:83%
If your electric cremator lands in
the hands of the wrong people...

437
00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:34.167 line:83%
It can be a disaster.

438
00:31:34.625 --> 00:31:37.750 line:83%
Unfortunately, we're rejecting
your patent application.

439
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:40.958 line:83%
The Government
not just rejected the patent right

440
00:31:41.125 --> 00:31:43.125 line:83%
but took away everything.

441
00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:46.500 line:83%
After that,
he did not know what to do.

442
00:31:48.042 --> 00:31:49.792 line:83%
So, he started working at
what came his way.

443
00:31:53.417 --> 00:31:55.292 line:83%
Until Simon
made an entry in his life.

444
00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:01.333 line:83%
He violated the Syndicate rules
by starting a new business.

445
00:32:01.792 --> 00:32:04.458 line:83%
Not only he made
an unexpected amount of money...

446
00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:07.042 line:83%
but he also earned a lot of enemies.

447
00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:15.500 line:83%
His opponent gangs tried a lot
to crack his secret, but it was in vain.

448
00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:19.375 line:83%
In the end,
they decided to kill Simon.

449
00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:18.750 line:83%
Hey, let's go!

450
00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:22.417 line:83%
Let's go, sir.

451
00:33:23.958 --> 00:33:25.167 line:83%
-Dayal, what the hell?
-Get in!

452
00:33:25.375 --> 00:33:26.250 line:83%
Can't you be careful?

453
00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:26.667 line:83%
Sir!

454
00:33:31.375 --> 00:33:32.292 line:83%
Sir, please hurry up!

455
00:33:50.542 --> 00:33:51.500 line:83%
Hey, lift him.

456
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.792 line:83%
His enemies tipped off
the Police about Simon.

457
00:34:02.583 --> 00:34:04.042 line:83%
The problem got bigger.

458
00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:07.875 line:83%
In one night,
22 bodies should be disposed of.

459
00:34:08.042 --> 00:34:11.542 line:83%
Simon was going mad,
not knowing what to do.

460
00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:12.917 line:83%
Dad.

461
00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:15.250 line:83%
One minute, please.

462
00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:24.583 line:83%
Dad.

463
00:34:25.958 --> 00:34:28.458 line:83%
I helped a person in customs
with clearance.

464
00:34:28.792 --> 00:34:32.208 line:83%
Using the copper wires and
parts from different propellers

465
00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:35.750 line:83%
he invented an Electric Chair
with Plasma Disintegration method.

466
00:34:36.042 --> 00:34:38.708 line:83%
If we bring him here,
we can turn bodies into ashes.

467
00:34:45.792 --> 00:34:47.708 line:83%
I don't know who and what you are.

468
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.833 line:83%
I invented this chair...

469
00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:53.583 line:83%
to cremate stray dogs or animals.

470
00:34:53.667 --> 00:34:56.042 line:83%
At its stage of invention,
it can't turn humans into ashes.

471
00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:57.958 line:83%
For God's sake spare us.

472
00:34:59.875 --> 00:35:02.083 line:83%
Hey, I thought you said
he's got three daughters.

473
00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:03.708 line:83%
I can see only one here.

474
00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:05.958 line:83%
Brother, the other two are young girls.

475
00:35:06.083 --> 00:35:07.083 line:83%
Our men are already out there.

476
00:35:09.917 --> 00:35:11.417 line:83%
So, I reckon three daughters in total.

477
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.292 line:83%
Bodies gotta burn!

478
00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:14.375 line:83%
It's the payment for your work.

479
00:36:16.917 --> 00:36:19.917 line:83%
I won't dread that you'll speak
about this to the others.

480
00:36:20.542 --> 00:36:22.417 line:83%
If I get arrested, so will you.

481
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:24.375 line:83%
Also, your daughter will be arrested.

482
00:36:24.542 --> 00:36:27.458 line:83%
If you don't want to get arrested
and lead a peaceful life...

483
00:36:28.375 --> 00:36:30.542 line:83%
You will obey my orders.

484
00:36:34.042 --> 00:36:37.708 line:83%
After that, they set up a place
to carry out the process.

485
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.708 line:83%
And continuously made him do it.

486
00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:47.125 line:83%
Even though he didn't like it
due to the threat...

487
00:36:47.458 --> 00:36:50.250 line:83%
...he continued to do it
for the sake of his daughters' safety.

488
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.208 line:83%
Why did you come over here?

489
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.667 line:83%
If another body washes up on the shore,

490
00:37:38.875 --> 00:37:40.125 line:83%
other departments
will start hunting you guys down.

491
00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:41.583 line:83%
Things will go out of control.

492
00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.125 line:83%
Do you even understand
the seriousness of the situation?

493
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.667 line:83%
Why did you stop disposing of bodies
like you used to?

494
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.458 line:83%
Don't make me call you again.

495
00:38:39.792 --> 00:38:43.417 line:83%
Do the Simon gang know Rajashekar's
daughter can operate this machine?

496
00:38:50.583 --> 00:38:51.792 line:83%
Four years ago...

497
00:38:52.208 --> 00:38:55.542 line:83%
when Rajashekar operated the chair
for the first time, a girl was with him.

498
00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.667 line:83%
-You're right.
-Yeah, right!

499
00:38:57.917 --> 00:38:59.875 line:83%
Go and bring her, you morons!

500
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.833 line:83%
Hey, let's go!

501
00:39:07.792 --> 00:39:09.625 line:83%
Hereafter, we can't live in this city.

502
00:39:09.625 --> 00:39:12.417 line:83%
Pack everything and be ready.
I'll come to the hostel in five minutes.

503
00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:17.417 line:83%
I don't get it. Why are you not
filing a complaint with the Police?

504
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.333 line:83%
You don't have to know.
Please pack.

505
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:25.958 line:83%
[in Telugu] Hey, who are you?
What do you want?

-Where were you?
-Which block are Priya and Revathi in?

507
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.208 line:83%
Who are you people?
You can barge into the hostel like this.

508
00:39:31.292 --> 00:39:31.792 line:83%
-Get out!
-Hey!

509
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.792 line:83%
Take away their phones
and lock the door.

510
00:39:33.833 --> 00:39:35.667 line:83%
Security! Security, where are you?

511
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.750 line:83%
-I'm going to call the Police.
-Wait, I'll call myself.

512
00:39:46.875 --> 00:39:49.750 line:83%
Who here is Rajashekar's daughters
Priya and Revathi?

513
00:39:50.417 --> 00:39:51.917 line:83%
Please step outside.

514
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.875 line:83%
Brother, Preethi is out here too.

515
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.792 line:83%

It's best if you come on your own.

If I have to,
then I'll touch inappropriately.

Please sit down.
Now tell me what's the matter?

572
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:44.833 line:83%
Tell me.

573

-The girls...
-Hold on. You're gasping for breath.

574

Breathe in...

Breathe out.

579
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.000 line:83%
Now, tell me what the issue is.

580
00:43:59.458 --> 00:44:01.000 line:83%
They asked me to bring Preethi.

581
00:44:01.042 --> 00:44:02.167 line:83%
Who gave you the orders?

582
00:44:02.958 --> 00:44:04.750 line:83%
-Dayal...
-What's the purpose?

583
00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:07.250 line:83%
It has to do with operating the machine.

584
00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:09.792 line:83%
Oh, that machine!

585
00:44:09.833 --> 00:44:11.458 line:83%
For that, you should've come to me.

586
00:44:11.625 --> 00:44:13.125 line:83%
Only I know how to operate it.

587
00:44:13.208 --> 00:44:14.333 line:83%
Am I right, Preethi?

588
00:44:16.417 --> 00:44:17.500 line:83%
Come on, man.

589
00:44:17.583 --> 00:44:19.583 line:83%
If you had mentioned it earlier,
we could have avoided this.

590
00:44:19.625 --> 00:44:20.583 line:83%
Oh, sorry, sorry!

Come along, I'll handle it.

595

[in Telugu] I, too,
know how to speak in Telugu.

596
00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:36.250 line:83%
I know Chiranjeevi, Naidu, and Reddy.

597
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.458 line:83%
I know Anushka, too.

598
00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:06.583 line:83%
I'm Rajashekar's man.

599
00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:09.458 line:83%
I used to assist him
in disposing of bodies.

600
00:45:09.958 --> 00:45:11.875 line:83%
His two daughters
are studying in college.

601
00:45:12.167 --> 00:45:13.542 line:83%
They're struggling to pay the college fees.

602
00:45:13.625 --> 00:45:15.750 line:83%
Without Rajashekar, his family and I
are struggling to make ends meet.

603
00:45:15.958 --> 00:45:17.750 line:83%
We were planning to reach out to you.

604
00:45:18.083 --> 00:45:19.500 line:83%
Unfortunately,
things turned out differently.

605
00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:33.625 line:83%
Was it you who beat up my men?

606
00:45:33.708 --> 00:45:35.208 line:83%
I swear I wasn't aware
that they were your men.

607
00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:37.792 line:83%
He threatened to harm Preethi.

608
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.208 line:83%
How can I stay calm when
he threatens to hurt a girl?

609
00:45:40.417 --> 00:45:41.042 line:83%
So...

610
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:43.792 line:83%
...I beat him up.

611
00:45:43.917 --> 00:45:45.583 line:83%
Had I known it was you,
I would've come with no qualms.

612
00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:48.000 line:83%
He's lying, Dayal.
He was already there before we arrived.

613
00:45:48.292 --> 00:45:49.625 line:83%
I think an informer tipped him off.

614
00:45:50.417 --> 00:45:51.458 line:83%
He may be a cop.

615
00:45:54.583 --> 00:45:57.542 line:83%
We never gave it a thought
when anyone tried to do us wrong.

616
00:45:58.208 --> 00:46:00.125 line:83%
But if someone does good,
we must think about it.

617
00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:02.667 line:83%
Let's check if you're the Police or not.

618
00:46:02.917 --> 00:46:04.625 line:83%
Do a strip search and
verify if he's wearing a wire.

619
00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:37.625 line:83%
We want money
and you want the job done.

620
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.292 line:83%
We both are in need.

621
00:46:39.792 --> 00:46:40.708 line:83%
Let's come to an agreement!

622
00:46:40.833 --> 00:46:42.708 line:83%
If not, spare us, we'll leave.

623
00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:45.583 line:83%
I don't want this humiliation.

624
00:46:46.958 --> 00:46:48.667 line:83%
Still, haven't you found someone
to operate the machine?

625
00:46:53.125 --> 00:46:54.708 line:83%
Do you know
how to operate the chair?

626
00:46:57.625 --> 00:47:00.833 line:83%
Come on, Boss.
I've been telling this since I arrived.

627
00:47:01.042 --> 00:47:03.958 line:83%
[in Telugu] You guys never told him, is it?

628
00:47:13.917 --> 00:47:15.458 line:83%
Go ahead, operate. I'll watch.

629
00:47:17.583 --> 00:47:19.000 line:83%
This is a high voltage reactor.

630
00:47:19.167 --> 00:47:21.875 line:83%
If we're in the room,
we'll turn to ashes like him.

631
00:47:22.083 --> 00:47:24.833 line:83%
You please step outside.
We'll pray and start the process.

632
00:47:30.958 --> 00:47:33.500 line:83%
Madam, you said you knew
how to operate this machine.

633
00:47:33.958 --> 00:47:34.583 line:83%
Please do it.

634
00:47:34.917 --> 00:47:36.625 line:83%
I only accompanied my father
to this place twice.

635
00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:39.083 line:83%
Everything is changed
and looks very professional.

636
00:47:39.125 --> 00:47:41.292 line:83%
I don't know what to do,
and I don't understand it.

637
00:47:41.583 --> 00:47:43.042 line:83%
We can't go to him saying this.

638
00:47:43.333 --> 00:47:44.667 line:83%
Please do something, Madam.

639
00:47:45.917 --> 00:47:46.708 line:83%
I'll try.

640
00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:49.208 line:83%
Bloody fool, didn't I ask
to keep Ravi on standby?

641
00:47:49.292 --> 00:47:51.458 line:83%
You got him drunk.
Now we're stuck in a situation.

642
00:47:51.542 --> 00:47:53.833 line:83%
Wherever I take him,
he somehow finds a liquor store.

643
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.458 line:83%
Did you hear that?
He's trying to break in.

644
00:47:57.417 --> 00:47:58.542 line:83%
God help me!

645
00:48:02.667 --> 00:48:05.292 line:83%
Hey, did he say anything?

646
00:48:05.458 --> 00:48:07.500 line:83%
He asked, "If I tell you,
will you tell the others?"

647
00:48:07.792 --> 00:48:09.083 line:83%
I said, "I won't tell anyone."

648
00:48:09.167 --> 00:48:11.083 line:83%
"Why should I tell you
if you're not going to tell anyone?"

649
00:48:11.125 --> 00:48:11.875 line:83%
He said that and got sloshed.

650
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:12.958 line:83%
I ought to!

651
00:48:30.625 --> 00:48:31.958 line:83%
Please push that lever.

652
00:48:32.167 --> 00:48:33.875 line:83%
Please be precise.
Is this the one?

653
00:48:41.708 --> 00:48:44.250 line:83%
It's been a while
since we operated the machine.

654
00:48:46.125 --> 00:48:48.000 line:83%
Please think hard and tell me.

655
00:48:52.542 --> 00:48:54.250 line:83%
I doubt they know how to operate it.

656
00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:55.625 line:83%
Yeah, I have seen him.

657
00:49:56.042 --> 00:49:57.583 line:83%
He visits during the night.

658
00:49:58.375 --> 00:49:59.875 line:83%
But he doesn't talk to anyone.

659
00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:01.458 line:83%
Have you ever seen him
fight with anyone?

660
00:50:01.542 --> 00:50:03.542 line:83%
No, sir. I've seen nothing like it.

661
00:50:04.833 --> 00:50:05.458 line:83%
Hey!

662
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.250 line:83%
Hey, what? What?

663
00:50:42.708 --> 00:50:43.250 line:83%
What is it?

664
00:50:43.417 --> 00:50:44.000 line:83%
Hey, hey, hey!

665
00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:28.000 line:83%
It's been a while
since I saw him around.

666
00:51:28.875 --> 00:51:30.458 line:83%
The last time I saw him,
he was with him.

667
00:51:33.875 --> 00:51:36.417 line:83%
-What's out there?
-It's a restricted area, sir.

668
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.542 line:83%
We don't have access
to enter that area.

669
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.583 line:83%
We need to buy a ticket, right?
Where are we going?

670
00:51:51.333 --> 00:51:53.125 line:83%
-Dwaraka Nagar.
-Dwaraka Nagar?

671
00:51:56.125 --> 00:51:57.750 line:83%
I only have 500s.
Would that be okay?

672
00:51:58.458 --> 00:51:59.125 line:83%
[in Telugu] Brother!

673
00:52:00.583 --> 00:52:01.708 line:83%
Two tickets to Dwaraka Nagar.

674
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:05.958 line:83%
-Hello!
-What happened?

675
00:52:07.292 --> 00:52:08.292 line:83%
Hey! Hey!

676
00:52:08.417 --> 00:52:09.417 line:83%
Please hold on a minute.

677
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:09.958 line:83%
Who?

678
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:17.958 line:83%
The arrangements for this week's
medical camp are now complete.

679
00:52:18.125 --> 00:52:18.833 line:83%
Can you check--

680
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:24.125 line:83%
-Hello.
-Dayal, is there a Rishi in your gang?

681
00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:25.667 line:83%
Yes!

682
00:52:26.125 --> 00:52:28.167 line:83%
Last evening, he met a police officer.

683
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.333 line:83%
Enquire him.

684
00:52:31.125 --> 00:52:31.958 line:83%
Where is Rishi?

685
00:52:32.542 --> 00:52:33.917 line:83%
He's loading the containers
with the others.

686
00:52:42.625 --> 00:52:43.417 line:83%
Who are these people?

687
00:52:43.542 --> 00:52:45.083 line:83%
It's the engagement party
for the captain's daughter.

688
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:46.333 line:83%
They got special permission.

689
00:52:49.125 --> 00:52:50.208 line:83%
Information is confirmed.

690
00:52:50.792 --> 00:52:51.833 line:83%
Dad is on his way here.

691
00:52:56.333 --> 00:52:57.125 line:83%
Monica?

692
00:53:01.083 --> 00:53:01.833 line:83%

Sir, I did nothing.

745
00:56:44.833 --> 00:56:46.833 line:83%
Sir, sir, I swear, I did nothing.

746
00:56:46.917 --> 00:56:49.583 line:83%
It's him, Sir.
I did a thorough background check.

747
00:56:49.917 --> 00:56:51.542 line:83%
Even yesterday, he met a Police officer.

748
00:56:51.917 --> 00:56:53.833 line:83%
-I did nothing, sir.
-Before, he used to work in another port.

749
00:56:53.958 --> 00:56:56.292 line:83%
Eight years ago, he shifted to our port.

750
00:56:56.375 --> 00:56:59.083 line:83%
All the factors confirm he's the mole.

751
00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:02.208 line:83%
Sir! Sir, sir, please don't kill me.

752
00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:04.625 line:83%
Sir, sir, sir...
Sir!

753
00:57:05.708 --> 00:57:07.167 line:83%
Sir, the officer I met is my uncle.

754
00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:09.125 line:83%
Sir, I went to meet my uncle.

755
00:57:09.333 --> 00:57:10.708 line:83%
I didn't do anything wrong.

756
00:57:10.958 --> 00:57:12.958 line:83%
Sir, please don't do it.
Sir, sir, sir, sir!

757
00:57:29.875 --> 00:57:31.292 line:83%
Fine, let it go.
I'll take care of it.

758
00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:36.000 line:83%
I told you I'll take care of it.

759
00:57:36.833 --> 00:57:39.250 line:83%
I'll sort it out in the morning.
Don't worry about it.

760
00:57:39.667 --> 00:57:42.000 line:83%
-Who all do you recognize from this?
-Sir, give me a minute.

761
00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:44.833 line:83%
I told you it will be done.
Okay, okay, bye.

762
00:57:46.958 --> 00:57:48.667 line:83%
Sir, I split it equally.

763
00:57:48.833 --> 00:57:50.917 line:83%
This is your half and this is mine.

764
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.792 line:83%
Seeing that they're dependent
on us to dispose of bodies.

765
00:57:58.292 --> 00:58:00.292 line:83%
I don't think so.
This gang would've killed Rajashekar.

766
00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:03.875 line:83%
Someone outside the gang
would have killed him.

767
00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:07.167 line:83%
It would be better
if I met Simon once.

768
00:58:07.375 --> 00:58:08.500 line:83%
But I don't know when he will come.

769
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.958 line:83%
Until he comes over,
you don't need to do this or come here.

770
00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:13.417 line:83%
You please get back to your business.

771
00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:16.542 line:83%
Why, sir?
You want the entire share.

772
00:58:19.208 --> 00:58:20.833 line:83%
I can't seem to understand you.

773
00:58:21.417 --> 00:58:22.833 line:83%
We didn't come here to make money.

774
00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.792 line:83%
We came here to find out
who murdered your father.

775
00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:28.083 line:83%
You suffered all this while
doing this horrific job.

776
00:58:28.292 --> 00:58:29.792 line:83%
Why are you desperate for money?

777
00:58:31.083 --> 00:58:34.167 line:83%
Thank goodness your father died
before he could see you like this.

778
00:58:35.583 --> 00:58:37.083 line:83%
What do you even know about us?

779
00:58:38.208 --> 00:58:39.542 line:83%
He was just your friend.

780
00:58:40.167 --> 00:58:41.167 line:83%
But he's our father!

781
00:58:42.208 --> 00:58:44.750 line:83%
More than a father,
he was our mother.

782
00:58:45.208 --> 00:58:48.042 line:83%
It's hard to raise three daughters
as a single parent.

783
00:58:49.375 --> 00:58:51.167 line:83%
I'm 29 years old.

784
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:55.583 line:83%
Girls of my age are falling in love,
getting married, and enjoying their lives.

785
00:58:55.792 --> 00:58:56.500 line:83%
But me...

786
00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:59.208 line:83%
I'm a living corpse
like the ones we're disposing of.

787
00:58:59.375 --> 00:59:02.625 line:83%
Because the fundamentals of life
have now become a luxury for me.

788
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:06.000 line:83%
When I close my eyes...

789
00:59:06.458 --> 00:59:08.375 line:83%
...I can only see my sisters.

790
00:59:08.792 --> 00:59:12.208 line:83%
When our mother died,
my sisters were too young to understand.

791
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.458 line:83%
Since then it's me and our father.

792
00:59:16.375 --> 00:59:17.500 line:83%
Now, even he's gone!

793
00:59:18.125 --> 00:59:20.417 line:83%
Who will care for my sisters
if something happens to me?

794
00:59:22.083 --> 00:59:24.042 line:83%
Do you know
my educational qualifications?

795
00:59:24.583 --> 00:59:26.083 line:83%
I pursued medicine for a year.

796
00:59:27.375 --> 00:59:28.375 line:83%
Then discontinued.

797
00:59:28.875 --> 00:59:32.375 line:83%
As my father couldn't afford fees,
I shifted to a pharmacy course.

798
00:59:33.417 --> 00:59:34.500 line:83%
I'm there for my sisters.

799
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.083 line:83%
But who's there for me?

800
00:59:38.167 --> 00:59:40.083 line:83%
The one person who supported me
is no longer here.

801
00:59:40.917 --> 00:59:43.917 line:83%
I'm not going to
spend this money on myself.

802
00:59:45.375 --> 00:59:48.500 line:83%
You didn't truly know me and
judged me as desperate for money.

803
00:59:49.292 --> 00:59:50.833 line:83%
You wouldn't understand.

804
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.542 line:83%
You're used to
living your life in solitude.

805
00:59:58.458 --> 00:59:59.875 line:83%
I shouldn't have spoken harshly.

806
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:02.750 line:83%
Please forgive me.

807
01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:06.417 line:83%
You're absolutely right.

808
01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:10.167 line:83%
I'm used to living in solitude.

809
01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:13.958 line:83%
Please take this.

810
01:00:15.292 --> 01:00:15.958 line:83%
I don't want it.

811
01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:18.917 line:83%
Each deserves their wage
for the work done.

812
01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:21.083 line:83%
That's yours and this is mine.

813
01:00:23.292 --> 01:00:24.292 line:83%
Wage!

814
01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:29.708 line:83%
Had it not been for your father,
I wouldn't be alive.

815
01:00:31.083 --> 01:00:32.083 line:83%
Long dead...

816
01:00:33.333 --> 01:00:36.583 line:83%
Nothing I do can repay
the help your father gave me.

817
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:40.500 line:83%
Please have this.

818
01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:42.792 line:83%
It's just money.

819
01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:44.417 line:83%
Please take it, Madam.

820
01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:51.208 line:83%
Don't cry.
I won't ask for it back.

821
01:00:51.333 --> 01:00:53.250 line:83%
Just pay me an interest of 30%.

822
01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:56.417 line:83%
Just kidding!

823
01:00:56.958 --> 01:00:58.250 line:83%
Sir, please wait.

824
01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:01.333 line:83%
The other day, I wanted to give you this,
but I wasn't sure whether I should.

825
01:01:01.833 --> 01:01:06.833 line:83%
Mom and Auntie died in a gas explosion
while we were in school.

826
01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:10.250 line:83%
This was the last memory I could salvage.

827
01:01:11.792 --> 01:01:14.250 line:83%
This is the only photo
of you and Auntie together.

828
01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:31.917 line:83%
However, I won't call you "uncle"
or consider you family.

829
01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.958 line:83%
Until the end,
I'll address you as "sir."

830
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.500 line:83%
-Deva?
-Yes!

831
01:01:45.458 --> 01:01:47.000 line:83%
You and the girl come to the port.

832
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.375 line:83%
I will come but not the girl.

833
01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.125 line:83%
Simon has summoned you both.

834
01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:01.667 line:83%
What can I do about
what my father did?

835
01:02:01.875 --> 01:02:03.375 line:83%
Do you think
I can reason with him?

836
01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:05.958 line:83%
Give me a minute.
I'll call you back.

837
01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:15.292 line:83%
Hey!

838
01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:38.875 line:83%
Sir, I'm Deva.

839
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.625 line:83%
Are you Rajashekar's assistant?

840
01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:50.875 line:83%
Yes, sir.

841
01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:58.792 line:83%
What is your name?

842
01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:01.042 line:83%
Preethi.

843
01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:08.667 line:83%
Why do you seem familiar to me?

844
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:10.500 line:83%
I don't think so, sir.

845
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.417 line:83%
Don't call me, sir.
You can call me Simon.

846
01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.625 line:83%
It's okay, sir. I feel comfortable
addressing you as "sir."

847
01:03:44.417 --> 01:03:45.292 line:83%
Sir, please don't do it.

848
01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:47.250 line:83%
Please don't do it.

849
01:03:47.292 --> 01:03:49.125 line:83%
Sir, sir, sir, sir. Sir!

850
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:05.542 line:83%
Hey!

851
01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:14.833 line:83%
He's the damn rat who's been
infiltrating my gang for 8 years.

852
01:04:16.708 --> 01:04:19.542 line:83%
I spared your life
because you once saved mine.

853
01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:34.625 line:83%
I announced a reward of two crores
for the person who finds the rat.

854
01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:37.250 line:83%
Will I take the reward myself?

855
01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.292 line:83%
Is that what you think?

856
01:04:40.917 --> 01:04:41.500 line:83%
No, sir.

857
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.125 line:83%
Now, listen closely.

858
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.625 line:83%
Before I'm done killing him...

859
01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:50.750 line:83%
...whoever climbs up
and removes the board

860
01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:52.333 line:83%
that person will be rewarded
with 2 crores.

861
01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.917 line:83%
Sir, I did nothing wrong.

862
01:05:23.917 --> 01:05:25.792 line:83%
If not for you,
they would've killed me.

863
01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:39.167 line:83%
-What the hell, Dad?
-No more loose ends.

864
01:05:40.708 --> 01:05:41.917 line:83%
Sir!

865
01:05:43.042 --> 01:05:44.375 line:83%
I removed the board!

866
01:05:52.875 --> 01:05:53.375 line:83%
Deva...

867
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.708 line:83%
You know who is Dayal among the two.

868
01:05:58.292 --> 01:06:01.042 line:83%
Bury Dayal
in the military graveyard located

869
01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:03.250 line:83%
behind the Police Commissioner's office.

870
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.708 line:83%
In the morning, any dog that passes by

871
01:06:07.792 --> 01:06:10.292 line:83%
should be able to sniff out the corpse.

872
01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:14.125 line:83%
For eight years,
he's been deceiving me...

873
01:06:14.667 --> 01:06:19.583 line:83%
The Police Department should understand
the consequences of infiltrating my gang.

874
01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:22.750 line:83%
You got that?

875
01:06:38.458 --> 01:06:41.792 line:83%
Sir, they did not want us
to electrocute but bury him.

876
01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:44.875 line:83%
But anyone in the gang could've done it.

877
01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.500 line:83%
Why do we have to do it?

878
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:48.667 line:83%
My thoughts exactly.

879
01:06:48.708 --> 01:06:50.167 line:83%
There's something more to it.

880
01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:53.000 line:83%
I'm repeating myself
about my earlier suggestion.

881
01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:55.083 line:83%
This is the final corpse
we'll get rid of together.

882
01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:56.833 line:83%
After this, you'd better be gone.

883
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.792 line:83%
I still have more to find out.

884
01:06:58.958 --> 01:07:01.750 line:83%
Who is Simon?
And why is he doing this?

885
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.042 line:83%
I will only earn his trust
if I follow his orders.

886
01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:09.083 line:83%
Only then can we find out
who killed your father.

If the heart stops beating temporarily...

915
01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:22.208 line:83%
...due to external factors, like this,
people come back alive.

916
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.625 line:83%
Lazarus Syndrome.

917
01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:48.000 line:83%
What happened?
Are you done with the job?

918
01:10:48.167 --> 01:10:51.208 line:83%
Hey, he did not die.
He came back alive.

919
01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:58.542 line:83%
Are you serious?

920
01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:00.333 line:83%
He's holding over millions with him.

921
01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:02.375 line:83%
No one knows where he has hidden it.

922
01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:05.667 line:83%
You send me your live location.
I'll come over there.

923
01:11:05.833 --> 01:11:06.333 line:83%
Hey!

924
01:11:18.958 --> 01:11:21.667 line:83%
Listen carefully.
Keeping him alive is your priority now.

925
01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:23.458 line:83%
Until I say so,
don't attend any calls.

926
01:11:24.167 --> 01:11:25.958 line:83%
Listen, it's not an ordinary matter.

927
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.417 line:83%
-We don't know how much he has hidden.
-Who are you talking to?

928
01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:30.250 line:83%
-If we swindle it from him...
-What should I do now?

929
01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:31.792 line:83%
Hereafter...

930
01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:34.083 line:83%
Whether it's you or the girl...

931
01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:35.917 line:83%
All your lives will be sorted.

932
01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.708 line:83%
Let's swindle all the money
and then kill him.

933
01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:40.542 line:83%
I'll be there in ten minutes.

934
01:11:44.917 --> 01:11:47.125 line:83%
Sir, I'm a Police officer.

935
01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:49.542 line:83%
Please spare me.

936
01:11:50.292 --> 01:11:53.667 line:83%
Sir... I have two children.
Please, sir.

937
01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:56.208 line:83%
I haven't seen my family in five years.

938
01:11:56.417 --> 01:11:58.083 line:83%
Please spare me, sir. I'll go home.

939
01:11:58.417 --> 01:12:00.583 line:83%
I did all this, to save my family.

940
01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:02.625 line:83%
I swear I won't come back.

941
01:12:02.708 --> 01:12:05.208 line:83%
I won't come back.
Madam, please tell him not to.

942
01:12:05.833 --> 01:12:07.417 line:83%
Sir. Please, sir.

943
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.208 line:83%
-Please, sir.
-Sir!

01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:20.000 line:83%
Everyone is afraid of death.

1100
01:25:20.708 --> 01:25:23.333 line:83%
However,
I feel sorry for your situation.

1101
01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:26.250 line:83%
[in Malayalam] I'll suggest you
an amazing idea.

1102
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:31.333 line:83%
Ensure my death appears
as caused by natural causes.

1103
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.792 line:83%
If it appears as if you tortured
and killed me...

1104
01:25:36.208 --> 01:25:38.125 line:83%
Why sir?
Will someone come after me?

1105
01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:40.333 line:83%
-Of course!
-I reckon you have only three daughters.

1106
01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:48.458 line:83%
Thirty years...

1107
01:25:49.292 --> 01:25:53.167 line:83%
I've had someone on standby
offline for thirty years.

1108
01:25:54.417 --> 01:25:56.083 line:83%
If he comes to know...

1109
01:25:56.792 --> 01:26:01.250 line:83%
You, your Boss, and your Boss's Boss...

1110
01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.292 line:83%
...will be chopped down to shreds!

1111
01:26:06.208 --> 01:26:09.167 line:83%
[in Malayalam] So, if I kill you,
your man will come and kill us.

1112
01:26:09.417 --> 01:26:10.250 line:83%
-Of course.
-Yes.

1113
01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:10.917 line:83%
Yes!

1114
01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:13.583 line:83%
Let him come. I'll wait for him.

1115
01:26:13.708 --> 01:26:14.333 line:83%
Are you sure?

1116
01:26:15.125 --> 01:26:17.875 line:83%
If someone does come,
what should I tell him?

1117
01:26:18.458 --> 01:26:19.042 line:83%
Come closer.

1118
01:26:20.292 --> 01:26:21.083 line:83%
Come on!

1119
01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:25.125 line:83%
"Power House."

1120
01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.250 line:83%
Power.

1121
01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:31.500 line:83%
Power.

1122
01:26:33.625 --> 01:26:34.500 line:83%
That's a good one.

1123
01:26:35.125 --> 01:26:36.167 line:83%
Power House.

1124
01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:58.250 line:83%
Your father was pleading with me
before he died.

1125
01:27:15.667 --> 01:27:17.042 line:83%
Brother, it's ready.

1126
01:27:23.583 --> 01:27:25.750 line:83%
NELLORE

1127
01:27:41.917 --> 01:27:43.750 line:83%
Is your head spinning from confusion?

1128
01:27:44.208 --> 01:27:47.833 line:83%
Hereafter, you will be
my eyes and ears over there.

1129
01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:50.208 line:83%
Simon is not in town.
It's the right time.

1130
01:27:50.542 --> 01:27:54.083 line:83%
Hereafter, without asking questions,
you must do everything I say.

1131
01:27:54.542 --> 01:27:57.542 line:83%
[in Malayalam] If you try to act smart...

1132
01:27:57.750 --> 01:28:01.750 line:83%
I'll make one call,
and then you both will die.

1133
01:28:01.875 --> 01:28:04.708 line:83%
Hereafter,
you must follow my orders.

1134
01:28:11.417 --> 01:28:12.375 line:83%
Are you on the bus?

1135
01:28:12.708 --> 01:28:15.583 line:83%
A man in a dark brown shirt
will hand you a bag.

1136
01:28:16.417 --> 01:28:18.708 line:83%
Shortly, you will receive files,
passport, and money.

1137
01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:19.750 line:83%
Put everything inside the bag.

1138
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:29.917 line:83%
Grab the bag and keys,
then wait at the tea shop in the market.

1139
01:28:46.208 --> 01:28:47.417 line:83%
One of my men will come over there.

1140
01:28:48.417 --> 01:28:49.500 line:83%
Give him the key.

1141
01:29:11.083 --> 01:29:12.542 line:83%
Hey, I'm taking him in.

1142
01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:17.125 line:83%
Are you inside the bathroom?

1143
01:29:17.667 --> 01:29:19.500 line:83%
Inside, the boy will open a door.

1144
01:29:19.917 --> 01:29:21.750 line:83%
Keep the bag inside,
take a picture, and send it to me.

1145
01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:25.750 line:83%
You must feel the urge to
stab that needle into my neck.

1146
01:29:26.875 --> 01:29:28.667 line:83%
But don't forget you have two sisters.

1147
01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:37.083 line:83%
Keep stitching.

1148
01:30:03.083 --> 01:30:03.958 line:83%
Good boy!

1149
01:30:07.667 --> 01:30:09.250 line:83%
Think practically, Arjun.

1150
01:30:09.667 --> 01:30:12.625 line:83%
If your father learns about us,
he might throw me into the sea.

1151
01:30:15.167 --> 01:30:17.250 line:83%
Yet you're determined to tell him...

1152
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:20.583 line:83%
How do you expect me to trust you?

1153
01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:26.208 line:83%
Neither I nor anyone else can
speak to my father about us.

1154
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.542 line:83%
For now, there's someone
who has earned my father's trust.

1155
01:30:32.708 --> 01:30:34.333 line:83%
I'm going to convince him
to talk to my father.

1156
01:30:45.083 --> 01:30:46.833 line:83%
The document is in Saravanan's hands.

1157
01:30:47.167 --> 01:30:48.250 line:83%
I can't retrieve it now.

1158
01:30:48.625 --> 01:30:49.833 line:83%
I need two more days.

1159
01:30:50.792 --> 01:30:53.917 line:83%
What makes you think
that I won't harm this girl?

1160
01:31:02.042 --> 01:31:03.667 line:83%
I know where he will store the file.

1161
01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:06.042 line:83%
-The key is where I said it will be.
-I found it.

1162
01:31:20.125 --> 01:31:22.458 line:83%
I was checking
Rajashekar's insurance report.

1163
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:23.375 line:83%
Not a problem, sir.

1164
01:31:23.875 --> 01:31:25.500 line:83%
I'm here to discuss something
important with you.

1165
01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:27.208 line:83%
When can we discuss?

1166
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.792 line:83%
Walk 30 feet straight ahead.

1167
01:31:36.875 --> 01:31:39.333 line:83%
On your left, next to the storage room,
there will be a vault.

1168
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.333 line:83%
The passcode to the vault...

1169
01:31:42.417 --> 01:31:43.708 line:83%
3300

1170
01:31:57.333 --> 01:31:58.875 line:83%
I was about to meet you myself.

1171
01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:01.375 line:83%
This rascal is working
for our opponent's team.

1172
01:32:01.625 --> 01:32:04.583 line:83%
He already has two crores in
reward money for removing the board.

1173
01:32:05.708 --> 01:32:09.167 line:83%
If I give him up as the informer,
I'll get another two crores.

1174
01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:14.375 line:83%
Eight others and I tailed him
for a week and caught him here.

1175
01:32:14.667 --> 01:32:18.083 line:83%
Until the Boss arrives, can you keep
him in your lab for a couple of days?

1176
01:32:19.583 --> 01:32:22.208 line:83%
If you agree, you will also
receive a share of forty lakhs.

1177
01:32:23.458 --> 01:32:24.250 line:83%
What do you say?

1178
01:32:27.667 --> 01:32:28.375 line:83%
Deal!

1179
01:32:34.125 --> 01:32:35.417 line:83%
Hey, keep walking!

1180
01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:47.667 line:83%
Hold on a minute.

1181
01:32:49.917 --> 01:32:51.167 line:83%
We belong to the same gang.

1182
01:32:51.542 --> 01:32:53.792 line:83%
We were already waiting out there
because we knew he would come.

1183
01:32:54.958 --> 01:32:56.167 line:83%
Who told you to come over there?

1184
01:32:58.208 --> 01:33:00.083 line:83%
How did you know the vault's passcode?

1185
01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:11.833 line:83%
Why aren't you answering?

1186
01:33:12.208 --> 01:33:14.125 line:83%

Please!

1210
01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:15.708 line:83%
How dare you
lay your hands on her scarf?

1211
01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:41.625 line:83%
Who are you?

1212
01:35:42.917 --> 01:35:43.833 line:83%
What's happening out here?

1213
01:35:45.250 --> 01:35:48.083 line:83%
These aren't just ordinary documents,
as you might think.

1214
01:35:48.417 --> 01:35:49.417 line:83%
They're client details.

1215
01:35:50.958 --> 01:35:52.250 line:83%
Client details?

1216
01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:56.292 line:83%
This isn't the only business they operate.

1217
01:35:56.625 --> 01:35:58.875 line:83%
This business is merely a facade
to deceive the public.

1218
01:35:59.458 --> 01:36:01.458 line:83%
There's another business
underneath this one.

1219
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.417 line:83%
Heart Trafficking.

1220
01:36:05.083 --> 01:36:08.167 line:83%
Their buyers are foreigners
from power sectors.

1221
01:36:08.583 --> 01:36:10.750 line:83%
Do you know where they're
getting these hearts from?

1222
01:36:10.875 --> 01:36:14.542 line:83%
They steal it from the poor labourers
working in the port.

1223
01:36:16.208 --> 01:36:18.958 line:83%
Based on the client's requirements,
they select a appropriate match.

1224
01:36:19.083 --> 01:36:20.667 line:83%
After that, they run a thorough
medical check-up.

1225
01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:23.042 line:83%
And take good care of them
until the requirements match.

1226
01:36:24.333 --> 01:36:25.625 line:83%
Once it's time,

1227
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:27.375 line:83%
they'll do a bypass surgery
and remove the heart.

1228
01:36:28.625 --> 01:36:30.333 line:83%
The list of selected individuals
for this year is now ready.

1229
01:36:30.708 --> 01:36:31.792 line:83%
There's a meeting in two days.

1230
01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:36.333 line:83%
The syndicate is unaware that Simon
is running this trafficking operation.

1231
01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:39.167 line:83%
To retrieve these documents...

1232
01:36:39.625 --> 01:36:41.250 line:83%
...my boss sent me undercover to this gang.

1233
01:36:41.833 --> 01:36:45.333 line:83%
Unfortunately,
I got caught by these guys.

1234
01:36:47.167 --> 01:36:48.708 line:83%
But I have saved your life.

1235
01:36:49.417 --> 01:36:50.208 line:83%
I am aware, sir.

1236
01:36:50.667 --> 01:36:52.000 line:83%
These dead bodies...

1237
01:36:52.583 --> 01:36:54.458 line:83%
I will ask my men to dispose of them.

1238
01:36:59.708 --> 01:37:01.708 line:83%
Brother, his original name
is not Dayalan.

1239
01:37:02.042 --> 01:37:04.667 line:83%
He underwent constable training
at Police Academy Thrissur, Kerala.

1240
01:37:04.958 --> 01:37:06.208 line:83%
2016 Batch.

1241
01:37:11.167 --> 01:37:12.958 line:83%
[in Malayalam] Go for another
five rounds of punishment.

1242
01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:15.875 line:83%
As per the department,
he was projected as unfit

1243
01:37:16.167 --> 01:37:18.875 line:83%
and was sent undercover covertly.

1244
01:37:22.583 --> 01:37:24.333 line:83%
This file has all his details.

1245
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:25.875 line:83%
Please call me
if you have any doubts.

1246
01:37:31.583 --> 01:37:34.042 line:83%
Somehow, we managed to find Dayalan.

1247
01:37:34.208 --> 01:37:36.833 line:83%
But he has chained himself to the girl.

1248
01:37:37.042 --> 01:37:39.000 line:83%
We're afraid that
he may be carrying any weapons.

1249
01:37:39.042 --> 01:37:41.667 line:83%
Until I say so, don't do anything.
Just keep a watch.

1250
01:37:41.833 --> 01:37:42.375 line:83%
Okay.

1251
01:37:43.667 --> 01:37:45.542 line:83%
Deva, one last job.

1252
01:37:45.708 --> 01:37:48.167 line:83%
When Arjun is leaving the port tonight,
take him in your vehicle.

1253
01:37:48.667 --> 01:37:49.875 line:83%
Until then, wait right there.

1254
01:37:51.625 --> 01:37:55.542 line:83%
Kalayani, in Mumbai, you should organize
our affairs to go to the Philippines.

1255
01:37:57.083 --> 01:37:58.125 line:83%
The rest I'll explain later.

1256
01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:02.250 line:83%
Don't be afraid.

1257
01:38:17.083 --> 01:38:17.958 line:83%
Arjun, sir!

1258
01:38:20.042 --> 01:38:21.500 line:83%
Didn't you want to discuss something?

1259
01:38:26.583 --> 01:38:28.458 line:83%
LONDON

1260
01:38:28.958 --> 01:38:32.250 line:83%
Some serious accusations have
emerged within our syndicate.

1261
01:38:32.417 --> 01:38:34.458 line:83%
The news has already reached Dahaa!

1262
01:38:38.208 --> 01:38:39.708 line:83%
-One minute.
-Please go ahead.

1263
01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:45.250 line:83%
Move the mat under your feet.

1264
01:38:48.917 --> 01:38:51.917 line:83%
Do one thing.
Instead, of taking him home...

1265
01:38:52.208 --> 01:38:53.792 line:83%
Take him to an isolated place,

1266
01:38:54.042 --> 01:38:54.917 line:83%
kill him,

1267
01:38:55.125 --> 01:38:57.667 line:83%
and bury him at the same spot
where his father asked to bury me.

1268
01:38:59.125 --> 01:39:00.000 line:83%
Hey!

1269
01:39:00.667 --> 01:39:03.167 line:83%
He's the only good soul in this gang.

1270
01:39:03.833 --> 01:39:05.583 line:83%
I can't do this job for you.

1271
01:39:09.875 --> 01:39:11.083 line:83%
Do you hear her?

1272
01:39:15.417 --> 01:39:17.292 line:83%
If you don't do as I say...

1273
01:39:32.208 --> 01:39:34.458 line:83%
Sir, why did you take a detour?

1274
01:39:42.667 --> 01:39:45.083 line:83%
As I was saying, the next consignment--

1275
01:39:49.417 --> 01:39:50.917 line:83%
You brought me to discuss matters.

1276
01:39:51.875 --> 01:39:54.417 line:83%
But seeing you bring me
to an isolated place...

1277
01:39:59.542 --> 01:40:02.333 line:83%
Due to the nature of my job,
I know one day death will come after me.

1278
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.375 line:83%
But I never expected
you'd be the one to kill me.

1279
01:40:08.292 --> 01:40:10.750 line:83%
I'm the reason
for your friend Rajashekar's death.

1280
01:40:11.417 --> 01:40:13.958 line:83%
I've been in a constant attempt
to flee from this gang.

1281
01:40:14.458 --> 01:40:16.167 line:83%
I'm holding back
for the sake of my father.

1282
01:40:30.667 --> 01:40:32.667 line:83%
Sir... Sir, sir!

1283
01:40:32.792 --> 01:40:34.542 line:83%
The vessel will reach Vizag--

1284
01:40:38.958 --> 01:40:40.750 line:83%
Sorry, guys. I'll be back!

1285
01:40:42.333 --> 01:40:42.833 line:83%
Sir!

1286
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:45.667 line:83%
I don't know why Arjun is with Deva alone.

1287
01:40:46.167 --> 01:40:47.458 line:83%
I'm suspecting something's not right.

1288
01:40:49.417 --> 01:40:51.292 line:83%
I didn't do any of it intentionally.

1289
01:40:53.667 --> 01:40:54.917 line:83%
Sir... Sir...

1290
01:41:07.375 --> 01:41:08.333 line:83%
-Go away.
-Sir?

1291
01:41:08.542 --> 01:41:11.208 line:83%
Go somewhere no one can find you.

1292
01:41:17.042 --> 01:41:19.042 line:83%
-Sir, Dad is calling.
-Talk to him.

1293
01:41:21.292 --> 01:41:23.667 line:83%
-Daddy!
-Arjun, where are you?

1294
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:25.792 line:83%
I'm at my friend's party.
I'll call you back.

1295
01:41:26.792 --> 01:41:27.417 line:83%
Okay.

1296
01:41:30.917 --> 01:41:31.958 line:83%
You keep an eye on Arjun.

1297
01:41:32.708 --> 01:41:33.792 line:83%
Are you carrying a gun?

1298
01:41:35.375 --> 01:41:36.917 line:83%
-Yes, I have it.
-You know what to do.

1299
01:41:37.208 --> 01:41:38.375 line:83%
I'll send back up.

1300
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:42.042 line:83%
And because of this accusation...

1301
01:41:42.208 --> 01:41:44.417 line:83%
Dahaa will be arriving in India soon.

1302
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.583 line:83%
Sir, I hope you won't get into
trouble because of my father.

1303
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:48.667 line:83%
Go!

1304
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:19.083 line:83%
You'll be addressing Dahaa, right?

1305
01:42:19.542 --> 01:42:22.458 line:83%
Simon! You'll be addressing Dahaa, right?

1306
01:42:24.125 --> 01:42:26.875 line:83%
-Simon, will you receive him?
-Yes! Yes!

1307
01:42:26.958 --> 01:42:28.708 line:83%
I'll... I'll receive Dahaa.

1308
01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:30.875 line:83%
Don't worry.
Go ahead, continue.

1309
01:43:05.417 --> 01:43:07.083 line:83%
I told you a million times.

1310
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.083 line:83%
But you never listened to a word.

1311
01:43:10.667 --> 01:43:12.417 line:83%
Despite my warning, you let him go.

1312
01:43:13.167 --> 01:43:14.167 line:83%
Switch to video call.

1313
01:43:16.333 --> 01:43:17.708 line:83%
We're on the 15th floor.

1314
01:43:18.375 --> 01:43:21.250 line:83%
If I let go of her,
she'll die in 30 seconds.

1315
01:43:21.792 --> 01:43:22.375 line:83%
Shall I?

1316
01:43:22.417 --> 01:43:25.750 line:83%
Listen, he's too young.
I didn't have the heart to kill him.

1317
01:43:25.792 --> 01:43:26.750 line:83%
So, let him go.

1318
01:43:27.083 --> 01:43:29.375 line:83%
Hey! Hey, she's an innocent girl.
Don't harm her.

1319
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.708 line:83%
Please hear me out.

1320
01:43:30.917 --> 01:43:32.250 line:83%
Dayal, I did follow your orders.

1321
01:43:32.333 --> 01:43:33.958 line:83%
Tell me more about what I have to do.

1322
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:36.000 line:83%
Had you followed this,
it wouldn't have happened.

1323
01:43:36.083 --> 01:43:38.167 line:83%
-Dayal, please don't do it.
-I'll talk after I drop her.

1324
01:43:38.375 --> 01:43:40.375 line:83%
-Please spare the girl.
-Watch me!

1325
01:43:40.958 --> 01:43:42.000 line:83%
Dayal, please hear me out.

1326
01:43:42.083 --> 01:43:43.333 line:83%
Dayal! Dayal!

1327
01:43:46.542 --> 01:43:47.583 line:83%
Dayal! Dayal!

1328
01:43:49.333 --> 01:43:51.417 line:83%
Hey, Dilip!

1329
01:43:52.208 --> 01:43:55.208 line:83%
Are you wondering
why my tone changed?

1330
01:43:56.917 --> 01:43:58.625 line:83%
This is the original tone!

1331
01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:01.750 line:83%
Constable: 143

1332
01:44:01.833 --> 01:44:04.958 line:83%
I've met different kinds villains
in my life.

1333
01:44:05.417 --> 01:44:09.542 line:83%
But I haven't met a cunning villain
like you until today.

1334
01:44:10.042 --> 01:44:12.292 line:83%
Dilip, do you realize the
biggest mistake you committed?

1335
01:44:12.375 --> 01:44:14.208 line:83%
By revealing everything to me.

1336
01:44:14.542 --> 01:44:16.167 line:83%
Pull her up!

1337
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:21.083 line:83%
Why don't you ask your men to check
if everything is intact inside the vault?

1338
01:44:21.375 --> 01:44:22.500 line:83%
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

1339
01:44:24.417 --> 01:44:24.875 line:83%
Hey!

1340
01:44:34.917 --> 01:44:37.167 line:83%
[in Telugu] Brother, the vault is empty.
He stole everything.

1341
01:44:37.583 --> 01:44:38.458 line:83%
Is it intact?

1342
01:44:39.083 --> 01:44:39.792 line:83%
It won't be.

1343
01:44:41.167 --> 01:44:42.750 line:83%
I removed everything yesterday.

1344
01:44:45.917 --> 01:44:47.542 line:83%
Take it. Take everything.

1345
01:44:48.167 --> 01:44:50.042 line:83%
You're being snarky because she's here.

1346
01:44:50.125 --> 01:44:51.542 line:83%
Her two sisters are under my watch.

1347
01:44:51.583 --> 01:44:52.625 line:83%
Hold on, Bhai!

1348
01:44:53.375 --> 01:44:56.750 line:83%
Check if they're still there.

1349
01:44:58.333 --> 01:44:59.667 line:83%
Bring the two girls outside.

1350
01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:03.750 line:83%
[in Telugu] They escaped.

1351
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000 line:83%
Are they out there?
They won't be.

1352
01:45:08.667 --> 01:45:10.542 line:83%
Don't be afraid. It's a safe place.

1353
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:12.333 line:83%
I spoke to Deva, sir.
He'll be here shortly.

1354
01:45:12.417 --> 01:45:13.583 line:83%
Okay? Stay safe.

1355
01:45:15.958 --> 01:45:18.708 line:83%
That night, there were only two people:
Arjun and the girl.

1356
01:45:18.833 --> 01:45:21.542 line:83%
The very second after I dropped Arjun,
you texted me.

1357
01:45:21.625 --> 01:45:22.750 line:83%
Asking why I let him go.

1358
01:45:22.833 --> 01:45:24.417 line:83%
There's no chance Arjun would've told you.

1359
01:45:24.542 --> 01:45:25.208 line:83%
That means...

1360
01:45:26.042 --> 01:45:27.417 line:83%
The girl must've informed you.

1361
01:45:27.542 --> 01:45:28.542 line:83%
If I'm right...

1362
01:45:29.333 --> 01:45:30.333 line:83%
she is

1363
01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:32.583 line:83%
...your wife.

1364
01:45:34.333 --> 01:45:35.333 line:83%
Hi!

1365
01:45:38.042 --> 01:45:41.417 line:83%
Also, I've arranged
the electric chair outdoors.

1366
01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:44.000 line:83%
What were you saying?
"15th floor and 30 seconds."

1367
01:45:44.167 --> 01:45:45.750 line:83%
If I press the button...

1368
01:45:46.042 --> 01:45:50.833 line:83%
your dear Kalyani
will turn into ashes in no time.

1369
01:45:51.458 --> 01:45:53.208 line:83%
Then apply it to your forehead.

1370
01:45:54.292 --> 01:45:55.750 line:83%
Unlock her.

1371
01:45:58.750 --> 01:46:00.833 line:83%
-Preethi, lock him up.
-Sir?

1372
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.708 line:83%
Lock him up.

1373
01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:04.500 line:83%
Show her your hands.

1374
01:46:10.417 --> 01:46:12.083 line:83%
Chain the other end to his neck.

1375
01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.708 line:83%
It's a dog chain
that fits him well, though.

1376
01:46:19.125 --> 01:46:20.458 line:83%
It looks apt.

1377
01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:23.000 line:83%
Preethi, go downstairs and get
into the vehicle waiting for you.

1378
01:46:26.792 --> 01:46:27.375 line:83%
Sir?

1379
01:46:29.375 --> 01:46:30.083 line:83%
My father...

1380
01:46:32.542 --> 01:46:35.292 line:83%
Can I please slap him once?

1381
01:46:35.458 --> 01:46:38.250 line:83%
Let your father hear the sound of it.

1382
01:46:40.333 --> 01:46:44.333 line:83%
While dying, my father
wouldn't have pleaded to you.

1383
01:46:47.333 --> 01:46:48.125 line:83%
That's about it!

1384
01:46:56.167 --> 01:46:57.250 line:83%
Come on, hurry up.

1385
01:47:08.583 --> 01:47:11.458 line:83%
Nothing much.
Ten men are here to rent rooms.

1386
01:47:11.833 --> 01:47:13.750 line:83%
They all look like henchmen.

1387
01:47:13.917 --> 01:47:16.167 line:83%
I suspect they're carrying weapons.

1388
01:47:16.333 --> 01:47:18.167 line:83%
So, I called to check what to do.

1389
01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:20.583 line:83%
-Give them rooms to stay.
-Okay!

1390
01:47:21.833 --> 01:47:23.083 line:83%
There are rooms for everyone.

1391
01:47:23.208 --> 01:47:25.417 line:83%
Watch her carefully.
Don't go anywhere.

1392
01:47:25.542 --> 01:47:26.125 line:83%
Deva...

1393
01:47:27.375 --> 01:47:29.458 line:83%
Isn't your Coolie number 5821?

1394
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:30.333 line:83%
Yes!

1395
01:47:30.958 --> 01:47:35.292 line:83%
Has anyone called your landline
and mentioned your Coolie number?

1396
01:47:36.625 --> 01:47:37.292 line:83%
No.

1397
01:47:37.792 --> 01:47:42.250 line:83%
Whoever calls you on that number
and mentions your Coolie number...

1398
01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:46.583 line:83%
...is your biological child.

1399
01:47:48.917 --> 01:47:50.250 line:83%
Who told you this?

1400
01:47:50.708 --> 01:47:56.417 line:83%
One last time, Rajashekar came
to your mansion to talk to you.

1401
01:47:56.833 --> 01:47:59.125 line:83%
Not sure what came over him.

1402
01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.542 line:83%
He returned without meeting you.

1403
01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:05.000 line:83%
After he returned, he told me

1404
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:06.875 line:83%
to tell you this
if something happened to him.

1405
01:48:06.917 --> 01:48:08.208 line:83%
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

1406
01:48:08.708 --> 01:48:11.292 line:83%
You see, I was high...

1407
01:48:12.708 --> 01:48:13.375 line:83%
I ought to!

1408
01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.667 line:83%
Hey, did someone call the landline
when I was not around?

1409
01:48:18.708 --> 01:48:20.458 line:83%
-No!

02:03:50.375 --> 02:03:50.917 line:83%
Hello?

1566
02:03:53.458 --> 02:03:54.583 line:83%
Hello! Hello!

1567
02:04:14.583 --> 02:04:16.208 line:83%
Send our men to both
Egmore and Central Station.

1568
02:04:16.375 --> 02:04:17.750 line:83%
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

1569
02:04:59.333 --> 02:05:00.083 line:83%
Brother!

1570
02:05:20.958 --> 02:05:21.958 line:83%
-[in Telugu] Please sit down.
-Get me water.

1571
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000 line:83%
Please step back.

1572
02:05:23.042 --> 02:05:24.167 line:83%
Please have some water.

1573
02:05:30.458 --> 02:05:32.667 line:83%
-Hello!
-Yes! What happened?

1574
02:05:33.333 --> 02:05:34.458 line:83%
That girl escaped.

1575
02:05:34.625 --> 02:05:37.083 line:83%
Passport, gold, and documents
are stuck with Deva.

1576
02:05:37.333 --> 02:05:38.500 line:83%
What do we do, Kalyani?

1577
02:05:38.792 --> 02:05:40.542 line:83%
Fine! You don't panic.

1578
02:05:41.125 --> 02:05:42.542 line:83%
I know where the documents are.

1579
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.208 line:83%
You head to the station's parking lot.

1580
02:05:44.458 --> 02:05:46.458 line:83%
Vehicle number 0026.

1581
02:05:46.875 --> 02:05:48.000 line:83%
Get inside the vehicle.

1582
02:05:48.250 --> 02:05:51.167 line:83%
Your actions should drive him mad.

1583
02:05:51.417 --> 02:05:53.792 line:83%
Fine! Where are you?
Why did you change the plan?

1584
02:05:53.875 --> 02:05:56.458 line:83%
Don't ask questions and do as I say.

1585
02:05:56.958 --> 02:05:57.750 line:83%
I'll talk to you later.

1586
02:06:06.208 --> 02:06:08.292 line:83%
Sir, the TV consignment is ready.

1587
02:06:08.458 --> 02:06:10.167 line:83%
Once you check, we will dispatch it.

1588
02:06:10.958 --> 02:06:13.792 line:83%
Also, Dahaa is on his way.
He'll be here soon.

1589
02:06:45.583 --> 02:06:46.667 line:83%
Sir, everything is ready.

1590
02:06:46.708 --> 02:06:48.458 line:83%
If you give me your phone,
we can run a check.

1591
02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.125 line:83%
Okay.

1592
02:06:49.708 --> 02:06:50.708 line:83%
Just wait a minute.

1593
02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:53.792 line:83%
Here.

1594
02:07:07.417 --> 02:07:09.875 line:83%
Sir, someone's on video call.

1595
02:07:10.292 --> 02:07:12.792 line:83%
If you connect now,
it'll display on all the screens.

1596
02:07:17.125 --> 02:07:17.708 line:83%
Sir.

1597
02:07:20.875 --> 02:07:22.583 line:83%
Indeed,
I joined your gang as an informer.

1598
02:07:23.042 --> 02:07:25.042 line:83%
For all these years,
I've been loyal to you.

1599
02:07:25.458 --> 02:07:27.250 line:83%
I don't know what to do now.

1600
02:07:27.458 --> 02:07:28.792 line:83%
Also, I can't help
but be compelled to do it.

1601
02:07:29.167 --> 02:07:31.125 line:83%
You are well aware what's
happening at the moment.

1602
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:33.542 line:83%
You still think I'm an informer.

1603
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:36.875 line:83%
But Deva is ahead of us.

1604
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:38.917 line:83%
He's got full control now.

1605
02:07:39.792 --> 02:07:43.167 line:83%
He took the files with details
of clients we sell organs to.

1606
02:07:43.417 --> 02:07:45.375 line:83%
He forced me to reveal it.
Please forgive me.

1607
02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:48.417 line:83%
If I don't do this
in front of your eyes...

1608
02:07:49.958 --> 02:07:51.583 line:83%
He's been monitoring us, sir.

1609
02:07:53.708 --> 02:07:55.875 line:83%
If I don't do it,
I will lose my wife.

1610
02:07:59.625 --> 02:08:01.750 line:83%
Please forgive me, sir.
Forgive me.

1611
02:08:14.625 --> 02:08:15.833 line:83%
I don't have another option.

1612
02:08:16.083 --> 02:08:18.625 line:83%
Still, I would like to
do you one last favor.

1613
02:08:18.917 --> 02:08:22.208 line:83%
Rajashekar's daughter is arriving
at Chennai Egmore railway station.

1614
02:08:22.375 --> 02:08:23.542 line:83%
If you go now, you can nab her.

1615
02:08:23.917 --> 02:08:25.000 line:83%
Please forgive me, sir.

1616
02:09:04.792 --> 02:09:06.167 line:83%
Hey! Everyone, get inside!

1617
02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:29.208 line:83%
Don't spare any corner
and rig the building.

1618
02:09:29.375 --> 02:09:31.083 line:83%
It should shatter when lit.

1619
02:09:55.958 --> 02:09:58.667 line:83%
We retrieved every speck of detail
about you and your network.

1620
02:09:59.125 --> 02:10:01.042 line:83%
The period when you worked
as a labourer in Mandwa.

1621
02:10:01.458 --> 02:10:04.458 line:83%
And why did you quit?
We know your history now.

1622
02:10:06.458 --> 02:10:09.958 line:83%
Even now you're not alone.
You're still living with those 18 people.

1623
02:10:10.292 --> 02:10:12.250 line:83%
All 18 are now at knife point.

1624
02:10:16.042 --> 02:10:17.208 line:83%
It's best you come with us.

1625
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.292 line:83%
If you refuse, then I'll slit
the throats of all 18 people.

1626
02:10:21.250 --> 02:10:22.208 line:83%
Just one whistle would do.

1627
02:10:23.167 --> 02:10:24.042 line:83%
You wanna see?

1628
02:10:38.875 --> 02:10:40.500 line:83%
Recognize the piercing whistle?

1629
02:11:09.208 --> 02:11:11.458 line:83%
You're right! We are labourers!

1630
02:11:12.542 --> 02:11:14.292 line:83%
But you've mistaken we're 18.

1631
02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.167 line:83%
We are 19!

1632
02:11:19.208 --> 02:11:20.208 line:83%

They're not here for the money.

02:14:37.958 --> 02:14:39.333 line:83%
Sir, asked me to bring you to him.

Where?

1655
02:14:41.625 --> 02:14:43.375 line:83%
He asked us to come to the mansion.

You both have been called elsewhere.

1658
02:15:06.625 --> 02:15:08.875 line:83%
That girl is going in another car.

1659
02:15:08.958 --> 02:15:10.083 line:83%

02:16:20.667 --> 02:16:22.417 line:83%
Sir... Please, sir.

02:16:22.458 --> 02:16:24.458 line:83%
I have nothing to do with it, sir.

1673
02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:26.417 line:83%
Call Dayalan!

1674
02:16:43.417 --> 02:16:45.500 line:83%
I've arranged everything we need
to go to the Philippines.

1675
02:16:46.083 --> 02:16:47.292 line:83%
Did you get the documents yet?

1676
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:49.458 line:83%
-Please tell him, Dayal.
-What are you saying?

1677
02:16:49.542 --> 02:16:51.375 line:83%
Tell him I have nothing to do with it.

1678
02:16:55.917 --> 02:16:56.458 line:83%
Sir!

1679
02:16:59.333 --> 02:17:02.792 line:83%
Tell him, Dayal. That I don't
have anything to do with it.

1680
02:17:04.833 --> 02:17:06.292 line:83%
Please tell him, Dayal.

1681
02:17:12.250 --> 02:17:15.417 line:83%
Now tell me
what you both plan to do next.

1682
02:17:15.458 --> 02:17:18.042 line:83%
I swear,
I have nothing to do with it.

1683
02:17:18.083 --> 02:17:21.292 line:83%
He paid me
to pretend to love your son.

1684
02:17:21.333 --> 02:17:24.792 line:83%
He blackmailed me to kill
my parents if I refused to do it.

1685
02:17:24.833 --> 02:17:27.500 line:83%
-I didn't have other option.
-Sir! Sir!

1686
02:17:27.542 --> 02:17:28.167 line:83%
Sorry, sir.

1687
02:17:28.208 --> 02:17:30.167 line:83%
Sir, she has nothing to do
with any of it.

1688
02:17:31.167 --> 02:17:33.042 line:83%
I forced her to pretend
to love your son.

1689
02:17:33.125 --> 02:17:34.875 line:83%
She's a poor thing.
Please spare her.

1690
02:17:35.542 --> 02:17:38.167 line:83%
Please, sir.
I beg you to spare her.

1691
02:17:39.167 --> 02:17:40.042 line:83%
Please spare her.

1692
02:17:40.333 --> 02:17:42.000 line:83%
Please spare me, sir.

1693
02:17:42.042 --> 02:17:43.083 line:83%
Sir, please don't do it.

1694
02:17:44.625 --> 02:17:46.583 line:83%
Sir, please don't do it.

1695
02:18:01.458 --> 02:18:05.750 line:83%
I have an enormous wealth
of 4000-5000 crores.

1696
02:18:06.250 --> 02:18:10.000 line:83%
To enjoy my wealth,
I don't have one too many children.

1697
02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:11.917 line:83%
I had only one son.

1698
02:18:12.125 --> 02:18:16.958 line:83%
If he wanted,
he could've easily replaced me.

1699
02:18:17.208 --> 02:18:21.458 line:83%
But he was not interested in my business
and went on to become a Customs Officer.

1700
02:18:22.042 --> 02:18:25.167 line:83%
You betrayed a very honest man.

1701
02:18:26.250 --> 02:18:28.667 line:83%
I am his father, damn it.

1702
02:18:29.917 --> 02:18:31.417 line:83%
Sir, please don't do it.
Sir! Sir!

1703
02:18:32.667 --> 02:18:34.917 line:83%
Sir, she did nothing wrong.
Please spare her life.

1704
02:18:35.625 --> 02:18:36.292 line:83%
Sir!

1705
02:19:00.375 --> 02:19:04.750 line:83%
Run as far as you can
and find a place to hide.

1706
02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:12.167 line:83%
How is Deva related to you?

1707
02:19:13.083 --> 02:19:15.208 line:83%
-Sir.
-Sir, is on his way.

1708
02:19:17.083 --> 02:19:19.250 line:83%
Is your Coolie number 5821?

1709
02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:20.708 line:83%
I'm there for my sisters.

1710
02:19:21.042 --> 02:19:22.375 line:83%
But who's there for me, sir?

1711
02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:23.292 line:83%
My name is Preethi.

1712
02:19:23.333 --> 02:19:24.458 line:83%
The one person who supported me
is no longer here.

1713
02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:26.792 line:83%
Is your Coolie number 5821?

1714
02:19:29.625 --> 02:19:31.500 line:83%
Sir, Deva crossed the loading area.
What should I do?

1715
02:19:31.583 --> 02:19:33.542 line:83%
Let him come. Send him up.

1716
02:20:09.250 --> 02:20:11.375 line:83%
I have a few questions to ask you.

1717
02:20:11.667 --> 02:20:15.625 line:83%
The heart transplant files
you took away from me...

1718
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:17.958 line:83%
...are not a big deal for me.

1719
02:20:18.083 --> 02:20:20.708 line:83%
But to people like Dayal,
it's a huge deal.

1720
02:20:26.667 --> 02:20:30.667 line:83%
I trusted you to kill one person.

1721
02:20:30.833 --> 02:20:34.458 line:83%
Had you killed him,
my son would be alive now.

1722
02:20:35.333 --> 02:20:38.333 line:83%
No matter what I do,
I won't get my son back.

1723
02:20:38.375 --> 02:20:39.333 line:83%
-I did not--
-You did not kill him.

1724
02:20:39.917 --> 02:20:42.083 line:83%
I wanted you to experience the agony

1725
02:20:42.125 --> 02:20:44.583 line:83%
of seeing your children get killed
in front of your eyes.

1726
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.958 line:83%
But you have no one in your life.

1727
02:20:48.833 --> 02:20:55.958 line:83%
However,
if I kill the daughter of Rajashekar...

1728
02:20:56.042 --> 02:20:58.583 line:83%
Then you'd feel the agony as I did.

1729
02:21:03.583 --> 02:21:06.417 line:83%
You didn't just come here
for your friend or his daughter.

1730
02:21:07.708 --> 02:21:08.708 line:83%
Tell me, who are you?

1731
02:21:09.125 --> 02:21:11.875 line:83%
Why did you come here?
If not, I'll kill her.

1732
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.042 line:83%
I did not kill your son.
Please spare her life.

1733
02:21:14.625 --> 02:21:16.208 line:83%
You can harm me however you want.

1734
02:21:27.375 --> 02:21:29.917 line:83%
Take her downstairs
to the operation theatre.

1735
02:21:30.125 --> 02:21:31.167 line:83%
She is a source, too.

1736
02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:33.792 line:83%
Keep the walkie-talkie on.

1737
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:36.708 line:83%
Once I give the order,
remove her heart.

1738
02:22:00.333 --> 02:22:01.250 line:83%
I'm a labourer.

1739
02:22:01.917 --> 02:22:03.333 line:83%
I'm an orphan.

1740
02:22:03.917 --> 02:22:06.708 line:83%
Sixty people, along with me,
to make a living...

1741
02:22:07.083 --> 02:22:08.708 line:83%
went to one corner in the
North side of the country...

1742
02:22:09.292 --> 02:22:11.458 line:83%
and joined as labourers
in an import-export company.

1743
02:22:11.625 --> 02:22:15.083 line:83%
Thirty-five years ago,
when we went to work over there...

1744
02:22:15.333 --> 02:22:17.792 line:83%
...there was not one soul present
to support us.

1745
02:22:17.833 --> 02:22:19.000 line:83%
Except for Rajashekar.

1746
02:22:19.375 --> 02:22:22.667 line:83%
It was he who supported
and helped the labourers.

1747
02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:26.458 line:83%
He was very affectionate toward me.

1748
02:22:26.875 --> 02:22:28.250 line:83%
He took me into his home.

1749
02:22:28.458 --> 02:22:33.833 line:83%
Also, he got me married
to his dearest sister.

1750
02:22:34.167 --> 02:22:36.792 line:83%
I was an orphan,
but he gave me an identity...

1751
02:22:37.125 --> 02:22:39.333 line:83%
...and helped me lead a respectable life.

1752
02:22:40.167 --> 02:22:43.833 line:83%
We're labourers,
and our Bosses are providers.

1753
02:22:44.167 --> 02:22:45.875 line:83%
We are unaware of the contents
inside the packages.

1754
02:22:45.917 --> 02:22:48.750 line:83%
Our job was to pick up
and drop off the packages.

1755
02:22:48.833 --> 02:22:51.917 line:83%
We had unwavering trust in our bosses.

1756
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:54.958 line:83%
But that trust shattered
on one unfortunate day.

1757
02:22:55.750 --> 02:22:56.917 line:83%
The Police raided the port.

1758
02:22:57.583 --> 02:23:02.208 line:83%
We discovered that the packages
contained high-value drugs.

1759
02:23:02.542 --> 02:23:04.125 line:83%
Our bosses blamed the labourers.

1760
02:23:04.625 --> 02:23:07.792 line:83%
And accused the laborers
of smuggling these drugs.

1761
02:23:08.875 --> 02:23:10.375 line:83%
We were helpless!

1762
02:23:11.042 --> 02:23:12.500 line:83%
As per their country's law and order...

1763
02:23:13.875 --> 02:23:18.792 line:83%
If caught smuggling drugs,
you'll be sentenced to life.

1764
02:23:19.167 --> 02:23:20.292 line:83%
We didn't know what to do.

1765
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.500 line:83%
The law enforcement arrived.

1766
02:23:22.958 --> 02:23:24.542 line:83%
"You're almost 400 labourers."

1767
02:23:24.792 --> 02:23:28.042 line:83%
"If 100 among you confess to the crime..."

1768
02:23:28.333 --> 02:23:31.875 line:83%
"...we'll get you deported and
take you to another country."

1769
02:23:32.417 --> 02:23:36.375 line:83%
We considered this
and selected 100 single men.

1770
02:23:37.542 --> 02:23:41.125 line:83%
Sixty among the hundred
were my men.

1771
02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:43.750 line:83%
They were innocent
but surrendered themselves for my sake.

1772
02:23:45.125 --> 02:23:46.417 line:83%
The way they looked at me.

1773
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:50.917 line:83%
"Hey, not only did you
turn us orphans into criminals,"

1774
02:23:51.208 --> 02:23:53.542 line:83%
"but you're sending us
to a different country as refugees."

1775
02:23:54.083 --> 02:23:55.667 line:83%
I was very guilty.

1776
02:23:56.333 --> 02:23:58.042 line:83%
I didn't speak a word
and went along with them.

1777
02:23:58.708 --> 02:24:01.833 line:83%
Rajashekar stopped me
from going with them.

1778
02:24:02.208 --> 02:24:03.542 line:83%
If you go, then you can't return.

1779
02:24:03.833 --> 02:24:06.292 line:83%
If you go,
you'll lose my sister and me.

1780
02:24:06.458 --> 02:24:09.125 line:83%
You won't see us again
in your lifetime.

1781
02:24:10.750 --> 02:24:13.583 line:83%
When it comes to family or labourers?

1782
02:24:14.667 --> 02:24:16.333 line:83%
Labourers are important to me.

1783
02:24:16.625 --> 02:24:17.792 line:83%
I went with them.

1784
02:24:20.125 --> 02:24:24.583 line:83%
Later, we realised
we're not getting deported.

1785
02:24:25.333 --> 02:24:28.833 line:83%
But we're getting killed and
discarded in the middle of the sea.

1786
02:24:31.125 --> 02:24:32.750 line:83%
I protested and killed everyone.

1787
02:24:33.083 --> 02:24:35.833 line:83%
But I could only save twenty.

1788
02:24:36.792 --> 02:24:40.000 line:83%
The labour leader who was the
heart and soul of the labourers...

1789
02:24:40.792 --> 02:24:45.958 line:83%
...mercilessly killed the bosses
responsible for it.

1790
02:24:50.125 --> 02:24:52.000 line:83%
The boss's name was Xavier.

1791
02:24:52.375 --> 02:24:53.667 line:83%
That is your father.

1792
02:24:53.875 --> 02:24:55.833 line:83%
The labour leader who killed him was...

1793
02:24:56.667 --> 02:24:57.500 line:83%
Deva!

1794
02:24:57.875 --> 02:24:58.917 line:83%
Devaraj!

1795
02:25:01.333 --> 02:25:02.167 line:83%
Me!

1796
02:25:02.875 --> 02:25:06.208 line:83%
The company's name is Seven Seas.
And the location was Mandwa.

1797
02:25:10.667 --> 02:25:13.417 line:83%
Simon, I thought you did
a background check on me.

1798
02:25:13.542 --> 02:25:15.500 line:83%
You did not do a good job, though.

1799
02:25:15.583 --> 02:25:17.042 line:83%
She's not Rajashekar's daughter.

1800
02:25:18.625 --> 02:25:19.792 line:83%
She's my daughter!

1801
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:23.000 line:83%
You kept harping about
knowing me from somewhere.

1802
02:25:26.083 --> 02:25:27.667 line:83%
Still, can't you figure it out?

1803
02:25:42.542 --> 02:25:44.208 line:83%
Guards!

1804
02:26:33.833 --> 02:26:35.417 line:83%
Guards, that girl--

1805
02:26:39.208 --> 02:26:39.750 line:83%
Sir?

1806
02:26:48.583 --> 02:26:49.125 line:83%
Hey!

1807
02:26:54.458 --> 02:26:55.917 line:83%
-Sir?
-Go and check.

1808
02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:00.292 line:83%
Guards!

1809
02:27:04.833 --> 02:27:06.708 line:83%
Back then, you killed my father
and became a hero.

1810
02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:08.125 line:83%
I was a child then.

1811
02:27:08.292 --> 02:27:09.083 line:83%
Now, bring it on!

1812
02:28:44.583 --> 02:28:48.708 line:83%
Yes! I came here to find
my friend's killer.

1813
02:28:49.333 --> 02:28:52.875 line:83%
But you are worse than your father.

1814
02:28:53.583 --> 02:28:54.833 line:83%
If I let you live...

1815
02:28:56.208 --> 02:28:58.083 line:83%
...my labourers won't stay alive.

1816
02:28:58.667 --> 02:29:00.792 line:83%
After you're done killing me...

1817
02:29:01.792 --> 02:29:04.333 line:83%
...one man will come looking for you.

1818
02:29:04.667 --> 02:29:05.667 line:83%
Let him come.

1819
02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:07.458 line:83%
I'll face him.

1820
02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:29.208 line:83%
Sir! Sir!

1821
02:29:34.417 --> 02:29:35.458 line:83%
They have arrived, sir.

1822
02:29:44.875 --> 02:29:47.458 line:83%
As I mentioned, he is here.

1823
02:29:52.125 --> 02:29:54.667 line:83%
Hey, kill that girl now.

1824
02:29:58.625 --> 02:30:01.208 line:83%
Freaking, remove her heart now.

1825
02:30:04.958 --> 02:30:06.667 line:83%
Brother, we are done here.

1826
02:30:07.292 --> 02:30:09.083 line:83%

1827
