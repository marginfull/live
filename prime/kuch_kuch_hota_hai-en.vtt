Hey, Rahul! Want to be friends?

2
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:26.141 line:82%
She looks just like her father.

3
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.018 line:82%
Doesn't she?

4
00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:31.772 line:82%
Tina's condition is very critical, Rahul.

5
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.315 line:82%
She doesn't have much time.

6
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:35.317 line:82%
We tried our best.

7
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:40.197 line:82%
She had severe internal bleeding.
We couldn't do anything.

8
00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:45.494 line:82%
She knew there would be
complications in her delivery.

9
00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:48.998 line:82%
She also knew how much
you wanted this child.

10
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.752 line:82%
She loved this baby more than her life.

11
00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:58.215 line:82%
I want my daughter to know me.

12
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.884 line:82%
Who her mother was, what she was like.

13
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.180 line:82%
l want her to be able to answer
all these questions herself.

14
00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:11.562 line:82%
Mum, I am leaving these
eight letters for her...

15
00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:16.525 line:82%
A letter for each of her birthdays.

16
00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:21.864 line:82%
These letters have everything
that I want to tell my daughter.

17
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.785 line:82%
These letters are going
to be her memories.

18
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:43.594 line:82%
You are very bad.

19
00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:49.391 line:82%
You are very bad.

20
00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:59.735 line:82%
Rahul, hey, Rahul!

21
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.287 line:82%
Want to be friends?

22
00:06:18.462 --> 00:06:22.925 line:82%
Promise me, you will never cry.

23
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.386 line:82%
Never.

24
00:06:33.102 --> 00:06:37.731 line:82%
Anyway, you look very bad when you cry.

25
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.828 line:82%
Will you make me one more promise?

26
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:54.498 line:82%
Please.

27
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:01.380 line:82%
You'll name our daughter Anjali.

28
00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:04.299 line:82%
Promise me...

29
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:13.475 line:82%
I'm sorry, Rahul.
I'm really sorry.

30
00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.940 line:82%
Don't go.

31
00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.549 line:82%
Will you make me one more promise?

32
00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:49.386 line:82%
You'll name our daughter Anjali.
Promise me.

33
00:07:56.518 --> 00:08:00.147 line:82%
Hi! I'm Anjali and you're
watching Channel Anjali.

34
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:04.568 line:82%
I am going to grow up and become a V.J...
You know, just like Neelam.

35
00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:09.323 line:82%
Hey, cut... cut... cut.
I'll be back after the break.

36
00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:12.784 line:82%
My hobbies are eating chocolates...

37
00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:15.579 line:82%
...beating up boys,
troubling my grandmother...

38
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.624 line:82%
...and reading mom's letters.

39
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:23.879 line:82%
Hey, I'm late. I have to get dressed
and meet my father.

40
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:27.925 line:82%
But I'll be back next week,
same time, same place. Watch me.

41
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.594 line:82%
No... no. I don't want
to hear anything.

42
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:33.096 line:82%
-I swear I'll not do it again.
-Leave me, I don't want to hear anything.

43
00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:34.264 line:82%
-Please.
-No.

44
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.660 line:82%
Hi!

45
00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:58.205 line:82%
Anjali, listen to me. Look...

46
00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:03.585 line:82%
Look, I'm just...
Two hours late.

47
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.005 line:82%
-Right!
-Okay, I'm sorry. I was busy.

48
00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.632 line:82%
So was I.

49
00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.176 line:82%
I haven't even watched
television today...

50
00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:13.804 line:82%
Because I was supposed to meet you.

51
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:16.181 line:82%
-To shop for you.
-Yeah.

52
00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.849 line:82%
This is too much, Papa.

53
00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:21.478 line:82%
I can't do everything.
I'm your daughter not your wife.

54
00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.107 line:82%
Why?

55
00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:29.695 line:82%
If I can be both your papa and mama...

56
00:09:31.947 --> 00:09:32.948 line:82%
Okay.

57
00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.165 line:82%
-What is it?
-Did you feel bad?

58
00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.875 line:82%
A bit.

59
00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:45.335 line:82%
-Sorry.
-Okay.

60
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.548 line:82%
Okay.

61
00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:55.804 line:82%
That is why one says,
there is only one god in many forms.

62
00:09:56.346 --> 00:10:01.768 line:82%
No matter what form,
he knows our devotion.

63
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.897 line:82%
It is important to keep
this bond with god.

64
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:07.941 line:82%
She speaks so well, doesn't she?

65
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.652 line:82%
So, that's all for today.

66
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:14.031 line:82%
Now we'll have...

67
00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.491 line:82%
I got this gift for Valentine's day.

68
00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.577 line:82%
-Roopa?
-Me?

69
00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:21.455 line:82%
Roopa will chant the divine hymn.

70
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.622 line:82%
Me?

71
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.207 line:82%
Please begin, Roopa.

72
00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:29.338 line:82%
-I have forgotten the divine hymn.
-What?

73
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.423 line:82%
What are you saying, Roopa?

74
00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:35.844 line:82%
Did you hear that, sisters?
She has forgotten the divine hymn.

75
00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.389 line:82%
My dear if you don't pay
attention to prayer,

76
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:41.350 line:82%
what will you teach your children?

77
00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:46.730 line:82%
The way we think and the things we say
have a deep impact on our children.

78
00:10:47.064 --> 00:10:49.775 line:82%
-Then what will she teach her children?
-Grandma...

79
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.319 line:82%
We were talking about children...

80
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.696 line:82%
-This is my granddaughter, Anjali.
-Greetings.

81
00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:56.948 line:82%
Hi, sexy!

82
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.953 line:82%
She has taught
her granddaughter very well.

83
00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.331 line:82%
-Who taught you that?
-Papa.

84
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.046 line:82%
Go get ready for the school function.

85
00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:14.674 line:82%
Grandma, the letter.

86
00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:16.635 line:82%
-When is your birthday?
-Tomorrow.

87
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:17.761 line:82%
So?

88
00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.013 line:82%
Go...

89
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.060 line:82%
Come on, hurry up.

90
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.145 line:82%
-Here are our seats.
-Sit down.

91
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.148 line:82%
Mr. Khanna, come, come.
Take your seat.

92
00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:31.358 line:82%
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

93
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.068 line:82%
-Hi, Makhaiya. Hello...
-Hello...

94
00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.403 line:82%
Enough.

95
00:11:35.946 --> 00:11:38.073 line:82%
Good evening, ladies and gentleman.

96
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:41.118 line:82%
And welcome to the
just one minute competition.

97
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.828 line:82%
It's a strange competition.

98
00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.330 line:82%
Children have to speak on stage...

99
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:49.918 line:82%
And the topics are given on the spot.

100
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.547 line:82%
On the spot.

101
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.298 line:82%
Stop it, Balwir. Control yourself.

102
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.426 line:82%
-Never mind. It's okay.
-Sorry.

103
00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:01.221 line:82%
But remember, every student
will be given only one minute.

104
00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:02.681 line:82%
Just one minute.

105
00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:06.184 line:82%
Just one minute?
Only one minute to speak?

106
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.103 line:82%
Exactly. Very unfair.

107
00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:13.024 line:82%
But yet our Jasso wins every year.
She's so talented, you know?

108
00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.193 line:82%
-Best of luck, Jaswinder.
-Same to you.

109
00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.572 line:82%
Our Jaswinder is the best.

110
00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.450 line:82%
Actually Anjali is also taking part
in the competition.

111
00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:22.701 line:82%
She'll come second.

112
00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.369 line:82%
-You don't worry.
-Thank you very much.

113
00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:25.829 line:82%
Welcome.

114
00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.874 line:82%
Our first contestant is Jaswinder Singh.

115
00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:35.172 line:82%
-Oh, my sweetheart! Come on, go for it!
-Jasso...

116
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:37.716 line:82%
Come on, go for it.

117
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.890 line:82%
My topic is Prayer.

118
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:48.059 line:82%
Every morning we pray to the lord.

119
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:52.647 line:82%
Papa says prayers will keep god happy...

120
00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.650 line:82%
-And he'll protect us.
-Wow!

121
00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:59.696 line:82%
Mum says that by praying
Grandma will be impressed,

122
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.908 line:82%
and will leave the big
house for us in the will.

123
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:07.662 line:82%
Prayer...

124
00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.874 line:82%
Pooja Bhatt is my favorite actress.

125
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.585 line:82%
And my best friend's name
is also Pooja.

126
00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:14.586 line:82%
Okay, thank you.

127
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.589 line:82%
-Wow! She was the best!
-So nice.

128
00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.966 line:82%
Next participant is Anjali Khanna.

129
00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:24.095 line:82%
Pick your topic.

130
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.518 line:82%
She'll come second.

131
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:50.288 line:82%
Your time starts now.

132
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.219 line:82%
Say...

133
00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:08.682 line:82%
Mother...

134
00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:21.653 line:82%
Mother...

135
00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:28.994 line:82%
Mother...

136
00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.504 line:82%
I'm sorry...

137
00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.340 line:82%
"Mother!"

138
00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:54.978 line:82%
A mother is someone who loves us so much,

139
00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.857 line:82%
that we sometimes can't understand it.

140
00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:05.697 line:82%
A mother is someone who makes
us realize how good we are,

141
00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.284 line:82%
and there's no one better than us.

142
00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:15.540 line:82%
Her happiness is in our laughter...

143
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.752 line:82%
...and sorrow in our sorrow.

144
00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.840 line:82%
She is someone we can't live without...

145
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.426 line:82%
Mother...

146
00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.054 line:82%
She is everything.

147
00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.557 line:82%
Only we don't have her.

148
00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.229 line:82%
But we have a father.

149
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.901 line:82%
And he is not that bad...

150
00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.405 line:82%
Then you give me a hug.

151
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.909 line:82%
That's number one!

152
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:12.931 line:82%
By the way, Rahul,
you remember Mr. Sharma?

153
00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.225 line:82%
-He called me.
-Who Mr. Sharma?

154
00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:18.687 line:82%
Our neighbor from Delhi.
He has sent a proposal.

155
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.564 line:82%
-For whom?
-For me.

156
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.859 line:82%
-Then get married.
-Shut up.

157
00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.154 line:82%
He was saying that the girl
is beautiful and well-mannered.

158
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.156 line:82%
I flatly refused.

159
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.784 line:82%
-I did the right thing, didn't I?
-Yes.

160
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.495 line:82%
-I did the right thing?
-Yes.

161
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.247 line:82%
Did I do the right thing?

162
00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.209 line:82%
Yes, Mom.

163
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:44.504 line:82%
Well, I must have done the right thing.

164
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:48.508 line:82%
l never do anything wrong.
I always do the right thing.

165
00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.972 line:82%
So what if the girl is well-mannered
and beautiful.

166
00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:57.016 line:82%
Everyone is beautiful and well-mannered.

167
00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.645 line:82%
Who wants to get married?
Mr. Sharma has gone mad.

168
00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.773 line:82%
Keeps sending me proposals.

169
00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:06.943 line:82%
Why doesn't he get himself married
and just leave me alone?

170
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.869 line:82%
What's wrong, mom?

171
00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:18.663 line:82%
I don't know, Rahul.

172
00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.333 line:82%
I feel like this family is incomplete.

173
00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:24.961 line:82%
Why?

174
00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:29.841 line:82%
You're here, I'm here and Anjali is here.

175
00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:32.719 line:82%
I don't feel like that.

176
00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:38.266 line:82%
You know, when I go out with my friends,

177
00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.894 line:82%
they always complain about
their daughters-in-law.

178
00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.979 line:82%
-Do they?
-But I can't even do that.

179
00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:48.860 line:82%
This is a big problem!

180
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:54.949 line:82%
So you need a daughter-in-law
to complain about.

181
00:17:58.495 --> 00:17:59.621 line:82%
No, son.

182
00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.416 line:82%
I just want you to be happy.

183
00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.419 line:82%
I'm happy.

184
00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:08.713 line:82%
Very happy.

185
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.676 line:82%
So you won't marry again?

186
00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:26.481 line:82%
Mom, we live once, die once,

187
00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:29.442 line:82%
get married once...

188
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.780 line:82%
And we fall in love only once.

189
00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.202 line:82%
It does not happen often.

190
00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:44.958 line:82%
You are fine, but what about Anjali?

191
00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:48.211 line:82%
Why?

192
00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.672 line:82%
What happened to her?

193
00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:54.801 line:82%
Don't you think she needs a mother?

194
00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.642 line:82%
She's fine.

195
00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.104 line:82%
She's fine.

196
00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:16.823 line:82%
She's got something even I don't have.

197
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.619 line:82%
Her mother's letters.

198
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.590 line:82%
Happy birthday, Anjali.

199
00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:58.990 line:82%
My dear, Anjali.
Happy Birthday, Anjali.

200

That same smile, those same eyes.
Isn't it?

203
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.293 line:82%
No, I look like you.

204
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.548 line:82%
Tell me, Anjali, does your father
still sleep with his shoes on?

205
00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.092 line:82%
Old habits die hard.

206
00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:21.554 line:82%
You're a big girl today, Anjali.

207
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.392 line:82%
So you will be able to understand
what I have to tell you.

Anjali?

212
00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.053 line:82%
You're late again.

213
00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.722 line:82%
I can't wake up so early.

214
00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:07.767 line:82%
Can't wake up or were you scared?

215
00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.646 line:82%

216
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.691 line:82%

219
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.910 line:82%
What's the point, you lose every day.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:27.787 line:82%
I won't lose today.

221
00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.373 line:82%
You say that every day.

You can take that from me.

323
00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:09.159 line:82%
Then what will they fall for, Rifat Bi?

324
00:31:09.451 --> 00:31:12.413 line:82%
Oh, god! What are you wearing?

325
00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:14.456 line:82%
-You should be ashamed.
-Tell me.

326
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.417 line:82%
I don't know.

327
00:31:16.542 --> 00:31:18.502 line:82%
-Please, tell us.
-No.

328
00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:20.713 line:82%
Tell us.

329
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.923 line:82%
Okay.

330
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:27.261 line:82%
Boys will fall for a girl's grace
and style.

331
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.016 line:82%
They'll go crazy over
the way they walk, talk and...

332
00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:33.684 line:82%
And?

333
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.687 line:82%
And I don't know.

334
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:38.564 line:82%
You girls talk too much.

335
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:42.651 line:82%
Come on, clean up this mess.

336
00:31:42.735 --> 00:31:45.029 line:82%
Oh, God! What do I do with this girl?

337
00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:49.033 line:82%
Anjali, what's this?
What are you wearing?

338
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:51.368 line:82%
-It's cool, Rifat Bi.
-Cool.

339
00:31:51.577 --> 00:31:54.705 line:82%
Try to be feminine once
in a while at least.

340
00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:57.541 line:82%
Not like them, but little bit.

341
00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:59.835 line:82%
Rifat bi, you say the same thing everyday.

342
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.546 line:82%
You know, I beat Rahul
at basketball again.

343
00:32:02.755 --> 00:32:06.342 line:82%
-Rahul? Stay away from that boy.
-Why?

344
00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:08.218 line:82%
He's my best friend.
He's my friend.

345
00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:11.221 line:82%
You never know when this friend
will turn into a lover.

346
00:32:11.305 --> 00:32:13.599 line:82%
Rahul? Please! Never! Yuck.

347
00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:15.184 line:82%
Yeah, I know it all.

348
00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:17.186 line:82%
Here I've got you some pudding.
Don't tell anyone.

349
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:20.481 line:82%
-Thank you!
-Let me go! Crazy girl.

350
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.151 line:82%
Hi, Radio Xaviers' wishes you
happy Friendship day.

351
00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:28.864 line:82%
Oh, my God!

352
00:32:29.448 --> 00:32:32.076 line:82%
No short skirts in my college, please.

353
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:35.287 line:82%
What a beautiful morning today.

354
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:37.247 line:82%
Good morning Ms. Briganza.

355
00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:39.416 line:82%
Good morning, boys.

356
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:41.251 line:82%
Nice color, Piyush.

357
00:32:42.836 --> 00:32:44.672 line:82%
I'm going to complain to your parents

358
00:32:44.755 --> 00:32:47.633 line:82%
you wear short skirts to
college in order to excite the boys.

359
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:48.759 line:82%
Excuse me.

360
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.598 line:82%
I said, no short skirts
in the college, please.

361
00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.603 line:82%
Miss Briganza.

362
00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:02.356 line:82%
You were saying something, Mr. Malhotra.

363
00:33:03.315 --> 00:33:08.112 line:82%
I was just saying,
wearing short skirts isn't permitted.

364
00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:11.573 line:82%
What? But this is the latest fashion,
Mr. Malhotra.

365
00:33:11.657 --> 00:33:14.952 line:82%
This is nothing.
Some girls aren't even wearing skirts.

366
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.331 line:82%
-Don't tell me that, Ms. Briganza.
-Yes, Mr. Malhotra.

367
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.545 line:82%
Mr. Malhotra,
don't I look beautiful today?

368
00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:27.589 line:82%
You are very quite.

369
00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:28.966 line:82%
"Quite"?

370
00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:30.676 line:82%
Cute.

371
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:32.928 line:82%
You're very cute.

372
00:33:35.639 --> 00:33:40.561 line:82%
If you expose like this in college,
these young boys and girls...

373
00:33:40.644 --> 00:33:42.271 line:82%
What do you mean by
young boys and girls?

374
00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:44.064 line:82%
Do you mean to say I'm not young?

375
00:33:45.482 --> 00:33:47.484 line:82%
You're very young.

376
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:51.488 line:82%
But, Mr. Malhotra, you wear
very boring clothes.

377
00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:53.657 line:82%
I know.

378
00:33:54.324 --> 00:33:55.492 line:82%
But you know...

379
00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:58.996 line:82%
When Mrs. Malhotra was alive,

380
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:02.624 line:82%
I used to wear fancy clothes
for her sometimes.

381
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:06.044 line:82%
-Really?
-But they're of no use anymore.

382
00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:08.213 line:82%
What do you mean,
"of no use anymore"?

383
00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:14.887 line:82%
Mr. Malhotra... Ms. Briganza...

384
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:18.557 line:82%
Mrs. Malhotra...

385
00:34:28.942 --> 00:34:31.695 line:82%
-Happy Friendship Day
-What are you doing?

386
00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:34.531 line:82%
Sharma. Always scaring me.
What're you doing?

387
00:34:34.615 --> 00:34:35.908 line:82%
This is a friendship band, sir.

388
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:38.827 line:82%
Now I'm not just your student,
I'm your friend, as well.

389
00:34:39.828 --> 00:34:41.121 line:82%
Very good.

390
00:34:41.622 --> 00:34:43.999 line:82%
Sir, you look very happy today.

391
00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:45.584 line:82%
What do you mean?

392
00:34:45.793 --> 00:34:48.921 line:82%
-No, I'm just asking, generally.
-Generally.

393
00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:51.882 line:82%
Generally, my daughter
is coming back today, that's why.

394
00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:54.009 line:82%
-Your daughter?
-Yes, Tina.

395
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:56.053 line:82%
-She's coming back from London.
-From London?

396
00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:58.722 line:82%
Yes, she was studying
at Oxford University.

397
00:34:58.806 --> 00:35:00.933 line:82%
Oxford University? Wow!

398
00:35:01.058 --> 00:35:02.684 line:82%
We all used to live there.

399
00:35:03.477 --> 00:35:07.105 line:82%
But when I lost my wife,
I couldn't stay there anymore,

400
00:35:07.189 --> 00:35:09.149 line:82%
so I decided to come back to India.

401
00:35:09.483 --> 00:35:11.026 line:82%
Didn't Tina come with you?

402
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:13.237 line:82%
No, Tina wanted to finish her studies.

403
00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:17.741 line:82%
But I yearned to see her.

404
00:35:18.242 --> 00:35:21.036 line:82%
So I told her to finish her final year
in my college.

405
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:24.122 line:82%
After all our college is no less
than Oxford University.

406
00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:25.374 line:82%
Yes, sir!

407
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:27.668 line:82%
My child, you'll take care
of my Tina, won't you?

408
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:28.919 line:82%
Off course, sir.

409
00:35:29.086 --> 00:35:31.380 line:82%
-Happy "Friendship Day."
-Thank you, sir.

410
00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:34.675 line:82%
-Good.
-Rahul? Unbelievable.

411
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.971 line:82%
You know, I'm the first girl to get
a friendship band from Rahul.

412
00:35:39.054 --> 00:35:40.973 line:82%
-Wow!
-Isn't it exciting?

413
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.182 line:82%
Of course.

414
00:35:44.601 --> 00:35:46.228 line:82%
-You know, Sonia...
-Yes.

415
00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:49.273 line:82%
You're the only one
I'm giving this friendship band to.

416
00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:51.275 line:82%
-Really, Rahul?
-Really, Sonia.

417
00:35:51.525 --> 00:35:55.404 line:82%
Because you're different from others.
And you're the most beautiful girl here.

418
00:35:55.529 --> 00:35:57.656 line:82%
-Really, Rahul?
-Really Sonia.

419
00:35:58.532 --> 00:36:01.660 line:82%
Oh, Rahul! Are you telling me the truth?

420
00:36:02.286 --> 00:36:04.621 line:82%
-Really, Tania.
-My name is Sonia.

421
00:36:05.122 --> 00:36:07.624 line:82%
Yes. Do you see?

422
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:10.961 line:82%
I was so lost in your eyes
that I forgot your name.

423
00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:14.006 line:82%
-I just can't believe this, Rahul.
-Trust me.

424
00:36:14.423 --> 00:36:16.466 line:82%
-Oh, Rahul...
-Oh, Sonia.

425
00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:20.137 line:82%
Stop it, Rahul.

426
00:36:29.229 --> 00:36:30.355 line:82%
Oh, Sonia.

427
00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:32.733 line:82%
Oh, Rahul.

428
00:36:36.862 --> 00:36:38.155 line:82%
These fell off.

429
00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:39.698 line:82%
-Not mine.
-You cheat!

430
00:36:39.865 --> 00:36:43.493 line:82%
-You liar.
-Hey, come on.

431
00:36:44.453 --> 00:36:47.414 line:82%
Oh! No... No... Tania,
what's your name?

432
00:36:47.497 --> 00:36:50.167 line:82%
-Sonia.
-Go away.

433
00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:52.544 line:82%
Wasted my half-hour.

434
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.714 line:82%
Don't you get tired of chasing
after these stupid girls?

435
00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:58.926 line:82%
-Hey, I don't run after girls...
-I know, I know it.

436
00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:04.431 line:82%
Can't you find one girl
with beauty and brains?

437
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:08.810 line:82%
Good! Beauty and brains?

438
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.980 line:82%
Where will I find such a girl?

439
00:37:17.194 --> 00:37:21.406 line:82%
I'm only passing my time with these girls.
I haven't found her as yet.

440
00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.992 line:82%
-Her?
-Her.

441
00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:34.419 line:82%
I'm looking for a girl who
makes something happen.

442
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.254 line:82%
Makes what happen?

443
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.008 line:82%
-Makes something happen in my heart.
-Makes what happen?

444
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:45.973 line:82%
Something happens.

445
00:37:47.516 --> 00:37:48.809 line:82%
You won't understand.

446
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:57.442 line:82%
When she walks, the world looks on.

447
00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:04.908 line:82%
And when she stops, time stops.

448
00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:10.789 line:82%
And when she smiles...

449
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.916 line:82%
"She, she, she."

450
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:15.168 line:82%
What will you do if you find her?

451
00:38:16.044 --> 00:38:18.714 line:82%
-What will I do if I find her?
-Yes.

452
00:38:20.966 --> 00:38:26.346 line:82%
I'll kneel down in front of her,
spread my arms and say...

453
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:29.933 line:82%
"Hey! Whoever you are, I love you."

454
00:38:44.114 --> 00:38:46.033 line:82%
-I love you.
-Sorry.

455
00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:48.201 line:82%
Don't be! I love you.

456
00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:51.204 line:82%
-Excuse me.
-No... No... Squeeze me.

457
00:38:53.206 --> 00:38:54.791 line:82%
Tina!

458
00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.379 line:82%
Tina.

459
00:38:59.629 --> 00:39:01.381 line:82%
-Hi, I'm Anjali.
-Hi.

460
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.925 line:82%
-Hi, I'm Rahul
-Hi.

461
00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:05.761 line:82%
-Tina, right?
-Yeah.

462
00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:08.096 line:82%
-How do you know her?
-This morning the Principal...

463
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.058 line:82%
Don't utter that old man's name
early in the morning.

464
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:13.602 line:82%
So, Tina, today's your first day
in the college?

465
00:39:13.727 --> 00:39:16.605 line:82%
-She just came from London.
-How do you know that?

466
00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:18.690 line:82%
Because, Rahul, this morning,
the Principal had...

467
00:39:18.774 --> 00:39:20.817 line:82%
Didn't I tell you not to utter
that bald man's name? Okay?

468
00:39:20.901 --> 00:39:22.402 line:82%
-Bald.
-So, Tina,

469
00:39:22.486 --> 00:39:25.363 line:82%
-where were you studying in London?
-At Oxford University.

470
00:39:25.447 --> 00:39:27.532 line:82%
Oxford... How do you know?

471
00:39:27.616 --> 00:39:29.326 line:82%
Because the Principal told me
this morning.

472
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:32.454 line:82%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Please, let that bald man be.

473
00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:34.122 line:82%
He's a grouch of a principal.

474
00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:36.041 line:82%
-And she's his stooge.
-"Grouch"?

475
00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:37.751 line:82%
Grouch, you're, right.
But forget him.

476
00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:41.254 line:82%
-Tell me how is your first day in college?
-Great.

477
00:39:41.338 --> 00:39:43.256 line:82%
Good morning.
All of you go to your classes.

-Jealous?

480
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:50.055 line:82%
Short skirt... Oh, god.

481
00:39:50.138 --> 00:39:52.641 line:82%
He's that grouch of a principal.

-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

483
00:39:54.935 --> 00:39:57.395 line:82%
Good morning, darling.

484
00:39:57.562 --> 00:40:00.065 line:82%
Short skirts are not allowed
in college, you know that?

485
00:40:00.148 --> 00:40:02.984 line:82%

Thank you.
Look, today's Tina's first day in college.

489
00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:11.243 line:82%
She just got back from London
and hasn't had the time to unpack.

490
00:40:11.326 --> 00:40:12.744 line:82%
She wore whatever
she could get her hands on.

491
00:40:12.828 --> 00:40:13.954 line:82%
How do you know that?

492
00:40:14.037 --> 00:40:16.248 line:82%
-Sir, I've known Tina since childhood.
-Since childhood?

493
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:17.958 line:82%

-Really, Papa.

494
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:19.209 line:82%

499
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.011 line:82%
In the staff room!

500
00:40:30.095 --> 00:40:32.639 line:82%

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.270 line:82%
Excuse me.

504
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.063 line:82%
Yeah.

505
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.859 line:82%
"He's old and bald.

506
00:40:44.693 --> 00:40:46.570 line:82%

507
00:40:46.862 --> 00:40:48.238 line:82%
Sweet! He's sweet, too.

508
00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:52.117 line:82%

00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:03.962 line:82%
We've only just met.
Friendship is a long way off.

512
00:41:09.426 --> 00:41:10.635 line:82%
Oh, shit!

513
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.183 line:82%
-Hey, did something happen?
-No.

514
00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:18.685 line:82%
-She's not my type.
-Why?

515
00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:20.478 line:82%
She's not an Indian.

516
00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:24.316 line:82%
She grew up in London,
and Londoners are quite different.

517
00:41:24.733 --> 00:41:27.861 line:82%
A girl should make you feel like
you can take her home to mom.

518
00:41:27.944 --> 00:41:32.073 line:82%
You know. No... She's not my type.

519
00:41:32.157 --> 00:41:34.951 line:82%
No, she's not my type.

520
00:41:35.035 --> 00:41:37.078 line:82%
You'll never get a girl
if you behave like this. Got it?

521
00:41:37.162 --> 00:41:38.246 line:82%
Why not?

522
00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:40.207 line:82%
-What about you?
-Me? Yuck! Never!

523
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.708 line:82%
"Yuck"?

524
00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:43.919 line:82%
If I don't find any other girl,
I'll marry you.

525
00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:46.213 line:82%
Anjali, no one would
want to marry you anyways.

526
00:41:46.296 --> 00:41:47.672 line:82%
Just, shut up.

527
00:41:56.264 --> 00:41:57.724 line:82%
Babe.

528
00:42:04.147 --> 00:42:05.190 line:82%
Hey, Tina!

529
00:42:05.774 --> 00:42:06.691 line:82%
Here.

530
00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:07.901 line:82%
Take this.

531
00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:10.904 line:82%
-What's this?
-This is our college sweatshirt.

532
00:42:10.987 --> 00:42:11.821 line:82%
Thanks.

533
00:42:11.988 --> 00:42:14.407 line:82%
Anjali. Can I ask you something?

534
00:42:14.658 --> 00:42:15.575 line:82%
Yeah sure.

535
00:42:17.327 --> 00:42:19.287 line:82%
Why is everyone staring at me?

536
00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:23.917 line:82%
Why the boys are staring at you,
you know that already.

537
00:42:24.084 --> 00:42:27.003 line:82%
And the girls want to know
why the boys are staring at you.

538
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:29.005 line:82%
So, they're also staring at you.
Yeah?

539
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.383 line:82%
Yeah.

540
00:42:31.967 --> 00:42:34.928 line:82%
Look, if you have any problem,
come to me.

541
00:42:35.011 --> 00:42:36.304 line:82%
Or you could go to Rahul, you know.

542
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:39.140 line:82%
-Rahul is the one I met yesterday.
-Right! He's my best friend.

543
00:42:39.266 --> 00:42:42.560 line:82%
We sort of rule this college.

544
00:42:44.646 --> 00:42:45.772 line:82%
Hi, guys.

545
00:42:47.732 --> 00:42:49.359 line:82%
This is Rahul. See.

546
00:42:50.944 --> 00:42:52.445 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

547
00:42:53.655 --> 00:42:55.407 line:82%
There's a rule in our college.

548
00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:59.411 line:82%
We make every fresher sing a song.
You know?
Do-Re-Mi.

549
00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:01.413 line:82%
-Right?
-Right.

550
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.957 line:82%
Rahul, she's the Principal's daughter.

551
00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:07.252 line:82%
So what? We can't break our rules, can we?

552
00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:08.586 line:82%
Right.

553
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:11.006 line:82%
-But, Rahul...
-Shut up, Principal's sidekick.

554
00:43:12.215 --> 00:43:17.429 line:82%
Tina. Tina Malhotra.

555
00:43:18.847 --> 00:43:22.642 line:82%
London... Oxford University and all?

556
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:28.440 line:82%
Sing a song in Hindi for us
and the entire college.

557
00:43:28.523 --> 00:43:29.441 line:82%
Hindi?

558
00:43:29.524 --> 00:43:31.192 line:82%
I'm really sorry.

559
00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:34.696 line:82%
What? Have you forgotten Hindi
after going to London?

560
00:43:34.863 --> 00:43:36.781 line:82%
Sorry! One minute, one minute.
Excuse me.

561
00:43:37.282 --> 00:43:39.284 line:82%
Rahul, how can she sing
a song in Hindi?

562
00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:41.619 line:82%
Is it because she's
Principal's daughter?

563
00:43:41.703 --> 00:43:45.332 line:82%
If he can't teach her,
how can he teach us? And you shut up.

564
00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:48.418 line:82%
So, Tina, I was saying...

565
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.089 line:82%
You'll sing a song in Hindi,
and immediately.

566
00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:56.134 line:82%
Normally, we don't have much time, do we?
Right?

567
00:43:56.343 --> 00:43:59.220 line:82%
-Right.
-Okay. Go on.

568
00:44:26.247 --> 00:44:32.170 line:82%
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

569
00:44:35.048 --> 00:44:41.012 line:82%
Lord, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

570
00:44:47.394 --> 00:44:53.108 line:82%
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

571
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:59.781 line:82%
Lord, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

572
00:45:01.616 --> 00:45:06.746 line:82%
The difficulties of Your devotees

573
00:45:07.288 --> 00:45:11.751 line:82%
The difficulties of Your servants

574
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:17.090 line:82%
You remove in an instant

575
00:45:17.757 --> 00:45:23.346 line:82%
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

576
00:45:24.597 --> 00:45:29.936 line:82%
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

577
00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:37.402 line:82%
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

578
00:45:54.878 --> 00:46:00.133 line:82%
Living in London and studying and growing
up there has not made me forget my roots.

579
00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:03.219 line:82%
And you don't forget that.

580
00:46:20.028 --> 00:46:21.321 line:82%
Yeah... Yeah...

581
00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:24.491 line:82%
Okay, catch it.
Okay... Yeah... Sure.

582
00:46:25.241 --> 00:46:26.534 line:82%
Oh, God!

583
00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.686 line:82%
Hey! You're sitting in my place.

584
00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:55.355 line:82%
-Oh! I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

585
00:46:55.563 --> 00:46:56.814 line:82%
Hey, Adi, move.

586
00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:00.735 line:82%
Morning class. Good morning.

587
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:02.946 line:82%
-Good morning, Madam.
-Settle down everyone.

588
00:47:12.497 --> 00:47:13.456 line:82%
Anyway...

589
00:47:13.581 --> 00:47:15.708 line:82%
Today, we're going to start a new lesson.

590
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:22.048 line:82%
An eternal love story.

591
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.384 line:82%
The eternal love story.

592
00:47:24.759 --> 00:47:28.054 line:82%
Before I start,
I have to ask you all something.

593
00:47:28.513 --> 00:47:31.140 line:82%
What do you know about love?

594
00:47:31.933 --> 00:47:34.394 line:82%
What do you know of love?

595
00:47:35.061 --> 00:47:36.020 line:82%
What's love?

596
00:47:36.563 --> 00:47:39.941 line:82%
Any one... any one... any one.
No one?

597
00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:42.318 line:82%
Tina.

598
00:47:43.278 --> 00:47:46.072 line:82%
-You tell me, what's love?
-Me?

599
00:47:46.948 --> 00:47:48.283 line:82%
I don't know.

600
00:47:49.284 --> 00:47:51.578 line:82%
Anjali, what're you doing?

601
00:47:51.828 --> 00:47:54.122 line:82%
You tell me, what's love?

602
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:56.416 line:82%
Love...

603
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.337 line:82%
Forget it.

604
00:48:02.463 --> 00:48:04.340 line:82%
Anyone else...

605
00:48:06.009 --> 00:48:06.843 line:82%
Rahul.

606
00:48:09.304 --> 00:48:10.430 line:82%
What's love?

607
00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:13.516 line:82%
Love?

608
00:48:15.435 --> 00:48:16.436 line:82%
Love is friendship.

609
00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:24.902 line:82%
If she can't become my friend,
I can never fall in love with her.

610
00:48:25.987 --> 00:48:28.239 line:82%
Because there's no love
without friendship.

611
00:48:29.032 --> 00:48:31.159 line:82%
Simple! Love is friendship.

612
00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:33.286 line:82%
Okay, Ms. Briganza.

613
00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:34.954 line:82%
Okay, Rahul.

614
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:37.582 line:82%
What an absolutely
delightful thought.

615
00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:42.795 line:82%
Love is friendship.

616
00:48:43.004 --> 00:48:45.798 line:82%
Did you hear that class?
Thank you, Rahul.

617
00:48:46.007 --> 00:48:49.302 line:82%
Thanks for sharing this absolutely
delightful idea with us.

618
00:48:49.677 --> 00:48:53.848 line:82%
Love is a friendship.

619
00:48:57.935 --> 00:48:58.978 line:82%
So?

620
00:49:01.397 --> 00:49:03.191 line:82%
Want to be friends?

621
00:49:08.696 --> 00:49:09.781 line:82%
Okay.

622
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:28.049 line:82%
Something happens...

623
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.804 line:82%
Happens...

624
00:49:37.809 --> 00:49:40.520 line:82%
My head. My legs.
I was sleeping upside down.

625
00:49:41.396 --> 00:49:42.313 line:82%
Hello.

626
00:49:42.772 --> 00:49:44.899 line:82%
Sorry Mr. Malhotra, Briganza here.

627
00:49:47.777 --> 00:49:48.736 line:82%
Yes, Ms. Briganza.

628
00:49:49.112 --> 00:49:50.655 line:82%
I didn't disturb you, did I?

629
00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:53.574 line:82%
I'm sure, even if I had disturbed you,
you don't mind.

630
00:49:57.245 --> 00:49:58.413 line:82%
Yes, Ms. Briganza?

631
00:49:58.621 --> 00:50:02.583 line:82%
Anyway, I called to tell you
that we've finished all our rehearsals.

632
00:50:02.667 --> 00:50:06.629 line:82%
Our college will be the best
in tomorrow's competition.

633
00:50:06.796 --> 00:50:08.881 line:82%
Students from other colleges
are going to be spellbound.

634
00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:10.091 line:82%
You know what I mean?

635
00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:13.344 line:82%
This is all because of you, Ms. Briganza.

636
00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:16.013 line:82%
And I've done it for you, Mr. Malhotra.

637
00:50:16.973 --> 00:50:18.266 line:82%
Really, Ms. Briganza?

638
00:50:19.392 --> 00:50:20.685 line:82%
Really, Malhotra.

639
00:50:21.978 --> 00:50:23.312 line:82%
Ms. Briganza.

640
00:50:27.483 --> 00:50:28.568 line:82%
I fell down.

641
00:50:29.277 --> 00:50:34.741 line:82%
And our next college is our college,
St. Xaviers.

642
00:50:34.991 --> 00:50:38.870 line:82%
Xaviers! Xaviers! Xaviers!

643
00:50:49.172 --> 00:50:50.089 line:82%
What?

644
00:50:50.173 --> 00:50:52.300 line:82%
Oh, my God! He can't come?

645
00:50:52.383 --> 00:50:54.927 line:82%
Ms. Briganza, there is a curfew
in their area.

646
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:57.930 line:82%
They can't leave.
Good God! Now what do we do?

647
00:50:58.014 --> 00:51:00.641 line:82%
We want Xaviers! We want Xaviers!

648
00:51:00.725 --> 00:51:04.187 line:82%
Mr. Malhotra.
Let me think, please...

649
00:51:07.023 --> 00:51:08.149 line:82%
-Idea!
-Idea?

650
00:51:09.192 --> 00:51:10.109 line:82%
Yes.

651
00:51:10.193 --> 00:51:11.068 line:82%
-No.
-No.

652
00:51:11.527 --> 00:51:14.655 line:82%
You have to do this or else
you both are going to fail.

653
00:51:15.323 --> 00:51:17.950 line:82%
But, sir, how can we sing
and dance on stage?

654
00:51:18.034 --> 00:51:20.453 line:82%
-We don't know anything.
-And you know about the students.

655
00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:22.121 line:82%
-They will not spare us.
-Correct.

656
00:51:22.205 --> 00:51:23.164 line:82%
-It's a bad idea.
-Right.

657
00:51:23.289 --> 00:51:25.792 line:82%
What do you mean it's a bad idea, Rahul?
Of course, it's a good idea.

658
00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:27.168 line:82%
Nothing will happen to you.

659
00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:29.128 line:82%
The students who were
going to perform today,

660
00:51:29.212 --> 00:51:31.464 line:82%
have recorded a tape of their rehearsals.

661
00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:37.053 line:82%
I'll play the tape
and you just have to move your lips.

662
00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:41.015 line:82%
Like in the films. Okay.

663
00:51:41.682 --> 00:51:42.767 line:82%
It won't work.

664
00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:45.770 line:82%
Why won't it work?
Of course it'll work.

665
00:51:46.187 --> 00:51:48.981 line:82%
My name is Chin Chin Chu

666
00:51:49.065 --> 00:51:52.026 line:82%
Moonlit sky, you and me
Hello Mr. how do you do?

667
00:51:56.239 --> 00:51:58.533 line:82%
Ms. Briganza, control yourself.
Control.

668
00:52:01.536 --> 00:52:02.495 line:82%
-No.
-No.

669
00:52:05.248 --> 00:52:06.541 line:82%
What do you mean by no?

670
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:08.376 line:82%
Anjali, you, too?

671
00:52:08.543 --> 00:52:11.170 line:82%
Anjali, you don't have any concern
for the reputation of your college?

672
00:52:11.254 --> 00:52:14.465 line:82%
-I know.
-That's very tragic! Very tragic.

673
00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:21.973 line:82%
Come on Rahul, it is for the college.

674
00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:27.270 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay. Come on, Mr. Malhotra.

675
00:52:27.603 --> 00:52:29.230 line:82%
Okay! Come on, Tina, you join us as well.
Come on.

676
00:52:29.438 --> 00:52:31.065 line:82%
No, no. I'm not coming.

677
00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:33.401 line:82%
-What are you saying?
-Hey, Anjali.

678
00:52:34.277 --> 00:52:36.237 line:82%
Why are you asking her? Let's go.

679
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:50.585 line:82%
One and only Rahul.

680
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:57.550 line:82%
Take it from the top. Play.

681
00:52:57.633 --> 00:52:59.552 line:82%
What do I play? This must be it.

682
00:52:59.635 --> 00:53:03.764 line:82%
You're a foreigner

683
00:53:03.848 --> 00:53:08.185 line:82%
You're a foreigner

684
00:53:08.269 --> 00:53:12.398 line:82%
You won't be here with us for long

685
00:53:12.481 --> 00:53:16.527 line:82%
You're a foreigner

686
00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:19.906 line:82%
Mr. Malhotra, what's this?

687
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:22.992 line:82%
Ms. Briganza, I made a mistake.
I played the wrong tape.

688
00:53:24.076 --> 00:53:25.786 line:82%
Hey, what the hell is happening?

689
00:53:28.331 --> 00:53:29.457 line:82%
Go...

690
00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:30.750 line:82%
Okay. Okay.

691
00:53:37.173 --> 00:53:38.382 line:82%
Switch off the music.

692
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.228 line:82%
I've found someone

00:54:33.729 --> 00:54:36.691 line:82%

What has happened to me?

696
00:55:14.895 --> 00:55:17.773 line:82%
Why do l feel so lost?

697
00:55:18.399 --> 00:55:24.363 line:82%
Either l was insane earlier
Or I've just become so

698
00:55:25.281 --> 00:55:28.576 line:82%
Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair

699
00:55:28.826 --> 00:55:31.954 line:82%
What have you done to yourself?

Don't know why, I am missing mom today.

From the first day of college.
Do you know what I did?

777
01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:50.809 line:82%
I beat him in arm wrestling.
Since then we have been best friends.

778
01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:52.478 line:82%
Best friends.

779
01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.939 line:82%
Rahul is your best friend, isn't he?

794
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:54.623 line:82%
I am a bit weak in Chemistry.
So, you take care of it. Okay.

795
01:03:58.544 --> 01:03:59.586 line:82%
Hi.

796
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:09.221 line:82%
Hey! Look forward.

797
01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.021 line:82%
Rahul...

798
01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.524 line:82%
-Hi...
-Hi... Hi...

799
01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:23.735 line:82%
So, your relatives live here?

800
01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:27.864 line:82%
Yes, here, not here. Here.
Not here. Here.

801
01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:33.662 line:82%
So, Rahul Khanna comes
to the temple every Tuesday.

802
01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:36.206 line:82%
-Yeah!
-How sweet!

803
01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:39.668 line:82%
Why did you lie at college then?

804
01:04:39.835 --> 01:04:43.130 line:82%
Actually boys don't go to the temple.
So...

805
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.215 line:82%
-But you do.
-Yes.

806
01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.050 line:82%
-Do you come every week?
-Yeah.

807
01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:49.678 line:82%
-How sweet!
-Look, don't call me sweet.

808
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:53.098 line:82%
Actually, my dad used to say,
"Don't say this to anyone in the college."

809
01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:54.516 line:82%
-"This"?
-Not this.

810
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.144 line:82%
"A man should bow
before three women only.

811
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:59.229 line:82%
"One before Mom..."
That's his mother.

812
01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.189 line:82%
"One before Goddess Durga.

813
01:05:01.273 --> 01:05:02.232 line:82%
"And..."

814
01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:04.610 line:82%
And?

815
01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:07.613 line:82%
And...

816
01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:22.753 line:82%
Wear it.

817
01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:25.631 line:82%
What's the word you use?
"Cool"? You'll look cool.

818
01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:28.800 line:82%
I was just trying it out.
Don't know how others wear all this stuff.

819
01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:32.387 line:82%
There's nothing wrong in looking
girlish once in a while.

820
01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:36.433 line:82%
Take this letter from your mother.
You were missing her, right?

821
01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:37.601 line:82%
Listen.

822
01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.770 line:82%
-And take this as well.
-What's this?

823
01:05:39.895 --> 01:05:40.812 line:82%
Present.

824
01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:52.199 line:82%
Hey.

825
01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:55.535 line:82%
Tina.

826
01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.371 line:82%
-Hey.
-Rahul.

827
01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.208 line:82%
Rahul, what are you doing here,
at this hour?

828
01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.752 line:82%
Actually I couldn't sleep and I
thought even you won't be asleep...

829
01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:05.754 line:82%
And if you're not sleeping,
then you'll just be thinking about me.

830
01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:07.297 line:82%
-So I came.
-What?

831
01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:09.174 line:82%
By the way, what do you prefer,
flowers or chocolates?

832
01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:10.175 line:82%
What?

833
01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:12.386 line:82%
I didn't bring anything.
I was just asking.

834
01:06:14.096 --> 01:06:15.222 line:82%
Just kidding.

835
01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:20.435 line:82%
-Thank you.
-By the way, I have chocolates as well.

836
01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:26.274 line:82%
Don't you think it's hot here?
Although, I'm okay.

837
01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:27.984 line:82%
I'm cool.

838
01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:30.153 line:82%
Come in.

839
01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:32.614 line:82%
If you insist.

840
01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:35.909 line:82%
-May I?
-Yeah, off course.

841
01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:36.993 line:82%
Thank you.

842
01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:38.745 line:82%
Nice bed.

843
01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.123 line:82%
Why are you standing?
Please come and sit.

844
01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.291 line:82%
-Come... Come...
-Thanks.

845
01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:54.010 line:82%
Isn't this the novel where the
butler murders the married couple?

846
01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:57.472 line:82%
-Thanks.
-Anytime. You're reading such a fat book.

847
01:06:57.556 --> 01:06:58.515 line:82%
You could've asked me.

848
01:06:58.598 --> 01:06:59.725 line:82%
Yes, this is that book.
I've read this.

849
01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:02.769 line:82%
Rahul, you didn't finish your story.

850
01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:03.895 line:82%
No, it's nothing special.

851
01:07:03.979 --> 01:07:06.606 line:82%
This couple goes on a holiday and
leave their butler behind...

852
01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:07.983 line:82%
Later one finds out the butler is...

853
01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:10.068 line:82%
-Not this story.
-Then?

854
01:07:10.152 --> 01:07:11.361 line:82%
The temple story.

855
01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.947 line:82%
Temple? What temple?
I don't know any temple.

856
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:14.990 line:82%
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

857
01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.366 line:82%
-Right.
-Right.

858
01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:17.951 line:82%
The same story...

859
01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:21.621 line:82%
A man should bow
before three women.

860
01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:24.791 line:82%
-Before his mother, before Goddess Durga.
-Is it?

861
01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:26.209 line:82%
-And?
-And?

862
01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:28.086 line:82%
-And?
-And?

863
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:29.963 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Tina.

864
01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:32.007 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Tina.

865
01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.718 line:82%
-Papa! Shut up.
-Grouch.

866
01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.511 line:82%
-Rahul, Papa will come.
-Congratulations.

867
01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:37.971 line:82%
-Shut up, Rahul! Leave.
-Okay, Bye-bye.

868
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.181 line:82%
Not that way.
Rahul, go this way.

869
01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:40.182 line:82%
-My ladder is there.
-There's no way out from here.

870
01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:41.558 line:82%
-And I haven't finished my story.
-You go out first.

871
01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:43.727 line:82%
-A man bows before three women.
-I don't want to hear anything.

872
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.145 line:82%
Before Mother, before Goddess Durga.

873
01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:47.314 line:82%
And... And... And... Tina!

874
01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:07.709 line:82%
And...

875
01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:32.025 line:82%
I'll climb the ladder,
and he'll get caught.

876
01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.401 line:82%
-What?
-Torch.

877
01:08:33.485 --> 01:08:34.486 line:82%
Throw it.

878
01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:35.654 line:82%
-Okay...
-Good.

879
01:08:39.324 --> 01:08:40.283 line:82%
Who hit me?

880
01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:44.329 line:82%
I'll be a ghost.

881
01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.374 line:82%
If any ghost comes,
it'll get scared of me.

882
01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.167 line:82%
Where has the ladder gone?

883
01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:50.418 line:82%
Ladder?

884
01:08:51.378 --> 01:08:52.420 line:82%
Ladder?

885
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.049 line:82%
Malhotra!

886
01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:00.345 line:82%
Why are you entering your own house
like a thief?

887
01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:02.514 line:82%
Why're you giggling?

888
01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:11.523 line:82%
Rahul, what are you doing?

889
01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:13.817 line:82%
-I was just coming to see you.
-Why?

890
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:14.985 line:82%
That's...

891
01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.029 line:82%
-Anjali, look, a shooting star.
-Where?

892
01:09:18.113 --> 01:09:19.573 line:82%
Not down here, up there.

893
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.076 line:82%
Did you know, they say, if you make a wish
when you see a shooting star,

894
01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:24.578 line:82%
your wish will be fulfilled.

895
01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:27.789 line:82%
-Do you believe that?
-Let's try.

896
01:09:28.123 --> 01:09:29.040 line:82%
Okay, make a wish.

897
01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:40.070 line:82%
You came close to me

898
01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:45.241 line:82%
Smiled ever so sweetly

899
01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:50.413 line:82%
You came close to me

900
01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:53.416 line:82%
Smiled ever so sweetly

901
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:58.880 line:82%
You don't know how many dreams
You have inspired in me

902
01:10:58.964 --> 01:11:01.174 line:82%
You came close to me

903
01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.843 line:82%
Smiled ever so sweetly

904
01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:06.137 line:82%
You don't know how many dreams

905
01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:08.264 line:82%
You have inspired in me

906
01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:14.479 line:82%
Now my heart neither
Wakes up nor sleeps

907
01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:20.318 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

908
01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:24.823 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

909
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.450 line:82%
You came close to me

910
01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:30.120 line:82%
Smiled ever so sweetly

911
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.539 line:82%
You don't know how many dreams

912
01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:34.708 line:82%
You have inspired in me

913
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.836 line:82%
Now my heart neither

914
01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:40.046 line:82%
Wakes up nor sleeps

915
01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:45.427 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

916
01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:50.890 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

917
01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:16.666 line:82%
Oh! What a feeling this is!

918
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:21.963 line:82%
What is this unquenchable thirst?

919
01:12:22.172 --> 01:12:27.635 line:82%
I know not, this drunken stupor

920
01:12:27.886 --> 01:12:30.221 line:82%
Of love that's consuming me?

921
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:35.643 line:82%
No one knows, why one loses
One's peace, when in love

922
01:12:35.727 --> 01:12:40.482 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

923
01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:46.446 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

924
01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:27.153 line:82%
My prayers have been answered

925
01:13:27.237 --> 01:13:32.659 line:82%
God knows when and how I fell in love

926
01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:37.539 line:82%
I wonder how

927
01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:40.667 line:82%
I found peace in turmoil

928
01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:46.131 line:82%
I sit alone, weaving memories

929
01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:50.927 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

930
01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:56.099 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

931
01:13:56.558 --> 01:13:59.185 line:82%
You came close to me

932
01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:01.896 line:82%
Smiled ever so sweetly

933
01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:04.190 line:82%
You don't know how many dreams

934
01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:07.193 line:82%
You have inspired in me

935
01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:09.445 line:82%
You came close to me

936
01:14:09.529 --> 01:14:12.073 line:82%
Smiled ever so sweetly

937
01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.659 line:82%
You don't know how many dreams

938
01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:17.370 line:82%
You have inspired in me

939
01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:20.456 line:82%
Now my heart neither

940
01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.333 line:82%
Wakes up nor sleeps

941
01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:27.881 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

942
01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:30.508 line:82%
What am I to do?

943
01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:33.219 line:82%
Something is happening

944
01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.527 line:82%
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

945
01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:52.071 line:82%
Hi.

946
01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:56.284 line:82%
The butler committed the murder.

947
01:14:56.534 --> 01:14:59.329 line:82%
Oh, God! Look there.

948
01:15:00.205 --> 01:15:03.499 line:82%
What is she wearing?

949
01:15:07.879 --> 01:15:09.339 line:82%
-Hi guys.
-Hi.

950
01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.090 line:82%
How do I look?

951
01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:15.345 line:82%
Just like Tina, right?

952
01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:16.721 line:82%
My foot.

953
01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:20.141 line:82%
Come on, tell me.

954
01:15:31.611 --> 01:15:32.820 line:82%
Sorry.

955
01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.493 line:82%
Stop it, Rahul.

956
01:15:40.245 --> 01:15:42.372 line:82%
She's looking so funny.

957
01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.209 line:82%
-Shut up, Rahul.
-No... No...

958
01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:09.691 line:82%
What?

959
01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:11.484 line:82%
Gone?

960
01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:16.823 line:82%
I'm crazy, right?

961
01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:21.244 line:82%
I wanted to look beautiful like you.

962
01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.080 line:82%
But I don't know anything.

963
01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:29.335 line:82%
Anjali, you are beautiful.
Very beautiful.

964
01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:31.296 line:82%
You're lying.

965
01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:34.299 line:82%
Didn't you see how they were
laughing at me?

966
01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:36.384 line:82%
-Oh! They're...
-They're idiots like me.

967
01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.220 line:82%
Actually, you're very beautiful.

968
01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:42.265 line:82%
Because you're different
from all the other girls.

969
01:16:42.724 --> 01:16:45.768 line:82%
At least you're not like
the other stupid girls I go after.

970
01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:51.733 line:82%
You know,
you can get any boy you want.

971
01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.234 line:82%
Anyone?

972
01:16:54.152 --> 01:16:55.194 line:82%
Anyone.

973
01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:56.946 line:82%
Anyone?

974
01:16:58.323 --> 01:16:59.407 line:82%
Anyone.

975
01:16:59.866 --> 01:17:01.743 line:82%
Except, he should have poor eyesight.

976
01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:09.459 line:82%
Okay, tell me where
you got this lipstick?

977
01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:12.462 line:82%
Babli in our class?
She gave it to me.

978
01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:15.965 line:82%
Stupid idiot. I'm going to hit her.

979
01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:36.778 line:82%
Love is madness
Intoxicating, too

980
01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:44.535 line:82%
It will be different to
Any happiness or sorrow

981
01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:46.954 line:82%
-Papa.
-Rahul

982
01:17:47.372 --> 01:17:49.165 line:82%
-Papa?
-What, "Papa"?

983
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.919 line:82%
You can't hide anything from me.

984
01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.714 line:82%
But Rahul?
Couldn't you find any other boy?

985
01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:57.924 line:82%
Come on, papa.

986
01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:01.969 line:82%
Actually, if it had been anyone else
in Rahul's place,

987
01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:05.390 line:82%
even then, maybe I would feel
exactly the same way.

988
01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:06.432 line:82%
Why?

989
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.019 line:82%
Because I'll have to share
your love with him. That's why.

990
01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:15.149 line:82%
I love you, papa.

991
01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:18.236 line:82%
That's the problem.
I love you, too.

992
01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:22.949 line:82%
Have you told him how you feel?

993
01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:37.547 line:82%
I just feel that Rahul and Anjali...

994
01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:41.426 line:82%
I know Rahul only loves you.

995
01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:45.638 line:82%
And Anjali is just his best friend.
That's all.

996
01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:48.224 line:82%
No, papa.

997
01:18:48.433 --> 01:18:52.603 line:82%
Somewhere hidden in this
deep friendship is deep love...

998
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:54.605 line:82%
And I don't want...

999
01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:57.275 line:82%
That friendship that might turn into love,

1000
01:18:57.567 --> 01:18:59.444 line:82%
I don't want to come in between that.

1001
01:18:59.527 --> 01:19:03.823 line:82%
The entire college knows
Rahul and Anjali are best friends.

1002
01:19:04.282 --> 01:19:05.283 line:82%
And nothing else.

1003
01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:09.454 line:82%
Go. Go and tell him
that you love him a lot.

1004
01:19:10.705 --> 01:19:15.042 line:82%
But I don't know whether
he loves me or not.

1005
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.753 line:82%
Don't keep matters of the heart a secret.

1006
01:19:17.837 --> 01:19:20.131 line:82%
Go and tell him.

1007
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:39.609 line:82%
I...

1008
01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:40.776 line:82%
I love you.

1009
01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:44.822 line:82%
I love you.

1010
01:19:49.202 --> 01:19:50.077 line:82%
Shit.

1011
01:19:51.204 --> 01:19:53.956 line:82%
I never thought I'd say this to someone...

1012
01:19:54.207 --> 01:19:56.667 line:82%
But I really love you.

1013
01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:00.671 line:82%
Shit.

1014
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.510 line:82%
I... I hope.
I can say all this to her.

1015
01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:08.346 line:82%
You know how many times
I wanted to tell her,

1016
01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:10.181 line:82%
but every time I go to her,

1017
01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.100 line:82%
when I start to say this...
That's all...

1018
01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:14.936 line:82%
I think, I'll tell her.

1019
01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:17.688 line:82%
To who?

1020
01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:20.149 line:82%
Tina, who else?

1021
01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:25.071 line:82%
Let's do it again.
I'm Rahul and you're Tina. Okay?

1022
01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:27.865 line:82%
Hey, look up. Up.

1023
01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:30.576 line:82%
I...

1024
01:20:39.544 --> 01:20:40.670 line:82%
I love you.

1025
01:20:46.676 --> 01:20:47.843 line:82%
I love you, too.

1026
01:20:51.806 --> 01:20:53.224 line:82%
She'll say that, won't she?

1027
01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.228 line:82%
-"Love"?
-Yeah.

1028
01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:58.646 line:82%
Come here.

1029
01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:05.361 line:82%
Shall I tell her?

1030
01:21:07.947 --> 01:21:09.407 line:82%
-Yes.
-Right now?

1031
01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:14.537 line:82%
Okay.

1032
01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:27.675 line:82%
God, never make anyone writhe
In the pain of love

1033
01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:52.158 line:82%
The heart's feelings
Get buried in the heart

1034
01:21:56.912 --> 01:22:02.710 line:82%
And never come to the lips

1035
01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:11.093 line:82%
And never come to the lips

1036
01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:40.706 line:82%
My first love is incomplete, Rifat bi.
My first love is incomplete.

1037
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:58.933 line:82%
I love you.

1038
01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:05.856 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1039
01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:12.029 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1040
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:17.952 line:82%
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

1041
01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.747 line:82%
There's nothing more left to say

1042
01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:27.002 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1043
01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:33.259 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1044
01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.887 line:82%
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

1045
01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.974 line:82%
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

1046
01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:43.477 line:82%
There's nothing more left to say

1047
01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:49.275 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1048
01:23:49.567 --> 01:23:55.156 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1049
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:57.199 line:82%
Mom...

1050
01:24:08.753 --> 01:24:12.006 line:82%
I gave all my happiness to you

1051
01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:18.095 line:82%
I gave my smiles to you

1052
01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:26.437 line:82%
Your locks enticed me
Bidding messages of faithfulness

1053
01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:32.193 line:82%
You couldn't care for my love
You couldn't care for my love

1054
01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:36.155 line:82%
There is nothing more left to say

1055
01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:41.619 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1056
01:24:42.453 --> 01:24:48.042 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1057
01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:50.544 line:82%
Excuse me... Sorry.

1058
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.838 line:82%
Anjali, Anjali.

1059
01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:54.298 line:82%
Sorry, madam.

1060
01:24:54.548 --> 01:24:56.383 line:82%
-Rahul, you check in the front.
-Yes.

1061
01:24:56.509 --> 01:24:58.677 line:82%
-I'll check that side.
-Yes, check...

1062
01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:00.596 line:82%
Anjali...

1063
01:25:07.186 --> 01:25:08.354 line:82%
One minute.

1064
01:25:09.688 --> 01:25:10.648 line:82%
Where are you going?

1065
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.650 line:82%
-Home.
-What?

1066
01:25:13.526 --> 01:25:16.737 line:82%
I got a letter from mom.
My father's not well...

1067
01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:19.031 line:82%
And there is lots of work
in the new house.

1068
01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:21.408 line:82%
You've lost it...
You're leaving after receiving a letter.

1069
01:25:21.534 --> 01:25:23.869 line:82%
-You're not going anywhere. Come.
-Rahul, I must go.

1070
01:25:23.953 --> 01:25:25.830 line:82%
How can you leave the term midway? Come.

1071
01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:28.666 line:82%
-Rahul, please try to understand.
-Finish the final exams and then go.

1072
01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:31.001 line:82%
-But, Rahul it's...
-Go after finishing the final exams.

1073
01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:32.837 line:82%
-Rahul, please.
-Go after the final exams.

1074
01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:35.548 line:82%
I may not come back
even for the final term.

1075
01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:42.888 line:82%
I'm not coming back, Rahul.

1076
01:25:43.222 --> 01:25:48.018 line:82%
Oh! Then you're leaving college.

1077
01:25:49.395 --> 01:25:50.604 line:82%
You're leaving me.

1078
01:25:53.399 --> 01:25:54.817 line:82%
And you didn't even tell me.

1079
01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:58.153 line:82%
Okay.

1080
01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:01.740 line:82%
I don't want to know.

1081
01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:04.660 line:82%
-Rahul, I'm going.
-Go.

1082
01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:06.996 line:82%
-Rahul, I'm going.
-Go...

1083
01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:09.915 line:82%
-Rahul, I'm not coming back.
-I don't care, okay.

1084
01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:03.510 line:82%
Shit.

1085
01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:10.434 line:82%
Anjali, Anjali...

1086
01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:14.355 line:82%
Anjali, please don't go.
Who will I play basketball with?

1087
01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:16.023 line:82%
You used to lose every time.

1088
01:27:16.357 --> 01:27:17.816 line:82%
Then why are you going?

1089
01:27:18.192 --> 01:27:19.652 line:82%
Mom needs me, Rahul.

1090
01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:21.153 line:82%
Don't I need you?

1091
01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:24.406 line:82%
Trouble Tina now, I've had enough.

1092
01:27:25.324 --> 01:27:27.451 line:82%
-I'll fail.
-Then fail.

1093
01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:28.786 line:82%
Hey, Anjali...

1094
01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:31.163 line:82%
Stop chasing those stupid girls now.

1095
01:27:39.505 --> 01:27:41.256 line:82%
I'll miss you, my friend.

1096
01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:43.300 line:82%
I'll miss you too.

1097
01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:26.510 line:82%
That day, I felt maybe I had
come between Rahul and Anjali.

1098
01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:29.930 line:82%
Maybe I had come between two friends.

1099
01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:34.393 line:82%
Anjali's silence told me everything.

1100
01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:38.605 line:82%
And I knew that
she loved your father very much.

1101
01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:42.443 line:82%
Perhaps even I couldn't love him as much.

1102
01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:45.779 line:82%
Anjali neither called nor wrote.

1103
01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:50.492 line:82%
She had gone away from our lives. Forever.

1104
01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:54.621 line:82%
Your father used to say
love is friendship.

1105
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.082 line:82%
Yes, I became his friend.

1106
01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:00.461 line:82%
But I could never become
his best friend.

1107
01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:04.048 line:82%
I know your father very well.

1108
01:29:04.882 --> 01:29:05.883 line:82%
He's lonely.

1109
01:29:06.175 --> 01:29:07.718 line:82%
But he'll never say anything.

1110
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:12.139 line:82%

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:16.089 line:82%
You're a principal
and you can't that even do that much?

1263
01:42:16.172 --> 01:42:19.008 line:82%
Why are you bringing me being a principal
into this discussion?

1264
01:42:19.551 --> 01:42:20.635 line:82%
One minute.

1265
01:42:22.846 --> 01:42:27.100 line:82%
Where will Anjali Sharma be?
She'll definitely know.

1266
01:42:36.067 --> 01:42:37.610 line:82%
Forgive me, Principal.

1267
01:42:38.444 --> 01:42:39.946 line:82%
But I had promised Anjali

1268
01:42:40.196 --> 01:42:42.532 line:82%
that I'll never reveal
her address to anyone.

1269
01:42:42.615 --> 01:42:44.450 line:82%
We came with a lot of hope.

1270
01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:48.997 line:82%
I can understand,
but my promise to Anjali...

1271
01:42:49.372 --> 01:42:52.709 line:82%
Rifat Bi, I'm also Anjali.

1272
01:42:53.459 --> 01:42:54.878 line:82%
Won't you tell me?

1273
01:42:59.382 --> 01:43:01.926 line:82%
Principal, her engagement is today.

1274
01:43:02.677 --> 01:43:04.637 line:82%
And she will get married this week.

1275
01:43:04.971 --> 01:43:06.973 line:82%
Anjali's mother has faith in a guru.

1276
01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.184 line:82%
He's also going there today
to fix a date for the wedding.

1277
01:43:10.393 --> 01:43:11.769 line:82%
You've come a little late.

1278
01:43:12.353 --> 01:43:16.941 line:82%
I was planning to go by train
tomorrow afternoon.

1279
01:43:17.275 --> 01:43:20.612 line:82%
The wedding will not happen.
My mother told me to...

1280
01:43:21.779 --> 01:43:23.281 line:82%
It won't take place.

1281
01:43:24.908 --> 01:43:27.952 line:82%
Guruji, we wanted
to fix a date for the wedding.

1282
01:43:28.036 --> 01:43:29.120 line:82%
Yes.

1283
01:43:29.913 --> 01:43:32.832 line:82%
-This is Aman's horoscope.
-Okay.

1284
01:43:33.249 --> 01:43:36.502 line:82%
Aman wants to go back to London.

1285
01:43:37.462 --> 01:43:39.964 line:82%
Could you fix the date
for this month itself?

1286
01:43:41.007 --> 01:43:42.467 line:82%
-This month?
-Yes.

1287
01:43:43.092 --> 01:43:45.970 line:82%
Principal, if you had come
a little earlier, maybe I could...

1288
01:43:46.095 --> 01:43:47.513 line:82%
Yes, but we didn't know.

1289
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:16.042 line:82%
I don't know why, but Anjali may be
experiencing an unlucky period,

1290
01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:19.128 line:82%
and until that unlucky period elapses,
you can't get her married.

1291
01:44:25.677 --> 01:44:29.097 line:82%
-Then next month?
-Next month is also not suitable.

1292
01:44:35.436 --> 01:44:38.064 line:82%
Anjali's wedding can't be fixed
before December.

1293
01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:50.827 line:82%
Hello!

1294
01:45:03.548 --> 01:45:05.174 line:82%
I have heard about God's miracles,

1295
01:45:06.718 --> 01:45:07.927 line:82%
but today I have actually seen one.

1296
01:45:08.928 --> 01:45:10.847 line:82%
The child's prayers have been answered.

1297
01:45:11.431 --> 01:45:14.142 line:82%
Anjali can't get married before December.

1298
01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:22.692 line:82%
Can I ask you something?

1299
01:45:23.276 --> 01:45:24.235 line:82%
Yes.

1300
01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:26.946 line:82%
Are you happy?

1301
01:45:33.411 --> 01:45:36.039 line:82%
What kind of question is that?
Of course I'm happy.

1302
01:45:37.874 --> 01:45:41.544 line:82%
I'm engaged. Aman is a good man.

1303
01:45:43.379 --> 01:45:44.547 line:82%
He loves me very much.

1304
01:45:45.715 --> 01:45:47.842 line:82%
-And he's...
-But do you love him?

1305
01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:54.515 line:82%
Anjali.

1306
01:46:01.397 --> 01:46:05.735 line:82%
I have already loved mom.

1307
01:46:08.196 --> 01:46:10.031 line:82%
Maybe I can't fall in love again.

1308
01:46:13.076 --> 01:46:18.081 line:82%
-Just think of this as a compromise.
-Compromise?

1309
01:46:20.875 --> 01:46:26.422 line:82%
I never thought that my daughter would
marry out of compromise and not love.

1310
01:46:28.466 --> 01:46:29.509 line:82%
I'm also a mother.

1311
01:46:30.468 --> 01:46:32.220 line:82%
I want you to be happy.

1312
01:46:32.929 --> 01:46:34.388 line:82%
To start your own home.

1313
01:46:35.807 --> 01:46:39.894 line:82%
But a home based on a compromise,

1314
01:46:40.812 --> 01:46:44.524 line:82%
is a house, not a home.

1315
01:46:48.402 --> 01:46:49.612 line:82%
The rest is upto you.

1316
01:47:30.778 --> 01:47:33.030 line:82%
Oh! I can't handle this religious stuff...

1317
01:47:35.241 --> 01:47:36.242 line:82%
I can.

1318
01:47:37.243 --> 01:47:40.288 line:82%
Today Guruji is going to chant
hymns and read the sacred book.

1319
01:47:40.496 --> 01:47:42.540 line:82%
Wow! Amazing. Amazing.

1320
01:47:42.915 --> 01:47:43.791 line:82%
This Guruji...

1321
01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:47.295 line:82%
Why? He postponed the wedding.

1322
01:47:48.421 --> 01:47:50.548 line:82%
I can't handle this anymore.

1323
01:47:50.756 --> 01:47:53.801 line:82%
-Even God gets fed up with so many hymns.
-Why?

1324
01:47:53.885 --> 01:47:57.763 line:82%
-Don't you want to ask God for something?
-What should I ask for? I've got you.

1325
01:47:57.847 --> 01:48:02.727 line:82%
Now, I think if we have a few children...
And I'm afraid God can't help with that.

1326
01:48:02.935 --> 01:48:04.729 line:82%
-Whatever it is, I've to do it myself.
-Behave yourself.

1327
01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:08.274 line:82%
Hey, Aman... Aman.

1328
01:48:08.774 --> 01:48:10.359 line:82%
Good morning...
Good morning.

1329
01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:13.362 line:82%
I saw you this morning
in the courtyard, topless.

1330
01:48:13.529 --> 01:48:16.199 line:82%
-Exercising, what else...
-What are you saying?

1331
01:48:17.033 --> 01:48:20.912 line:82%
-Hey, fatty... Youth in old age.
-Hey, shut up.

1332
01:48:21.287 --> 01:48:22.663 line:82%
You are be old.

1333
01:48:23.122 --> 01:48:25.541 line:82%
Hey, don't tease him.

1334
01:48:25.791 --> 01:48:29.086 line:82%
What a handsome boy!
Don't you have a brother?

1335
01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:30.213 line:82%
What are you saying?

1336
01:48:30.296 --> 01:48:33.090 line:82%
-My Gurpreet is also very pretty.
-What are you saying?

1337
01:48:34.133 --> 01:48:35.092 line:82%
Forget Gurpreet.

1338
01:48:35.635 --> 01:48:38.554 line:82%
My Jaspreet is Miss Chandigarh.

1339
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:42.808 line:82%
Ms. Chandigarh or Ms. Sector 11.

1340
01:48:43.559 --> 01:48:47.271 line:82%
Okay come on now, Guruji has started.

1341
01:48:47.605 --> 01:48:49.232 line:82%
-Greetings!
-Okay, bye Aman.

1342
01:48:50.608 --> 01:48:51.859 line:82%
Come.

1343
01:48:51.943 --> 01:48:54.195 line:82%
Anjali, there is a call for you.

1344
01:48:54.862 --> 01:48:55.863 line:82%
Excuse me.

1345
01:48:56.489 --> 01:48:58.157 line:82%
Thank you so much,
mother-in-law.

1346
01:48:58.407 --> 01:48:59.408 line:82%
Welcome, son-in-law.

1347
01:49:00.201 --> 01:49:02.161 line:82%
Hello? Hello?

1348
01:49:06.749 --> 01:49:08.000 line:82%
-Hello?
-Hello?

1349
01:49:08.292 --> 01:49:09.377 line:82%
I love you.

1350
01:49:10.628 --> 01:49:11.462 line:82%
Aman...

1351
01:49:13.089 --> 01:49:15.633 line:82%
-I have a small problem.
-What?

1352
01:49:16.634 --> 01:49:18.636 line:82%
Don't leave me like this.

1353
01:49:19.011 --> 01:49:21.264 line:82%
Aman, don't know who's on the line?

1354
01:49:22.014 --> 01:49:24.934 line:82%
And anyway you are going to
Shimla for your summer camp.

1355
01:49:25.685 --> 01:49:27.478 line:82%
You're also going to Bombay.

1356
01:49:27.561 --> 01:49:30.022 line:82%
For 24 hours only
and you're going for a month.

1357
01:49:30.356 --> 01:49:34.735 line:82%
Aman, I go there every year
to teach singing and dancing.

1358
01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.363 line:82%
Now those children have become
a part of my life.

1359
01:49:37.446 --> 01:49:40.408 line:82%
Okay. They've also become
a part of your life.

1360
01:49:41.158 --> 01:49:43.035 line:82%
Only I'm left.

1361
01:49:44.996 --> 01:49:45.830 line:82%
Hello?

1362
01:49:48.207 --> 01:49:50.418 line:82%
Why do I get the feeling,
you don't love me?

1363
01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:52.795 line:82%
Because I don't.

1364
01:49:53.337 --> 01:49:56.799 line:82%
-And you don't want to marry me?
-Right, I don't want to.

1365
01:49:59.051 --> 01:50:01.012 line:82%
Hey! Any tantrums this time...

1366
01:50:01.429 --> 01:50:04.348 line:82%
...and l'll drag you by the
hand to the marriage pandal.

1367
01:50:04.515 --> 01:50:05.891 line:82%
You'll force me?

1368
01:50:07.059 --> 01:50:08.185 line:82%
If need be.

1369
01:50:09.729 --> 01:50:11.272 line:82%
You have the guts to do it?

1370
01:50:12.857 --> 01:50:13.691 line:82%
Try me.

1371
01:50:16.485 --> 01:50:18.112 line:82%
I'll stay with your aunts.

1372
01:50:18.487 --> 01:50:20.740 line:82%
You go to Shimla for your Summer Camp.

1373
01:50:21.449 --> 01:50:22.283 line:82%
Summer camp?

1374
01:50:24.493 --> 01:50:25.328 line:82%
Shimla.

1375
01:50:25.661 --> 01:50:28.331 line:82%
What?
What? Summer camp? In Shimla?

1376
01:50:28.956 --> 01:50:31.917 line:82%
No, no, no.
You're not going to any summer camp.

1377
01:50:32.084 --> 01:50:34.879 line:82%
-No way. Too much snow there.
-Papa, it's a summer camp.

1378
01:50:34.962 --> 01:50:37.131 line:82%
Whatever it may be,
you're not going there.

1379
01:50:37.214 --> 01:50:38.716 line:82%
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

1380
01:50:39.008 --> 01:50:41.010 line:82%
Papa, they teach singing
and dancing there.

1381
01:50:41.218 --> 01:50:43.971 line:82%
And you also know how much
I like to sing and dance.

1382
01:50:44.221 --> 01:50:45.931 line:82%
When did you start liking
singing and dancing?

1383
01:50:46.015 --> 01:50:48.517 line:82%
I said no. "No" means no.
That's all.

1384
01:50:49.185 --> 01:50:50.478 line:82%
Papa, it's not fair.

1385
01:50:50.686 --> 01:50:56.525 line:82%
-Let her go, son.
-Mom, I'll handle this, okay.

1386
01:50:58.069 --> 01:51:01.697 line:82%
But, Rahul, try to understand. Why can't
she go? I'll go with her.

1387
01:51:01.864 --> 01:51:06.369 line:82%
-Papa, I want to go.
-No, Anjali. No.

1388
01:51:06.577 --> 01:51:08.371 line:82%
-She'll enjoy-
-Shut up!

1389
01:51:09.455 --> 01:51:12.500 line:82%
When I have said no, then no one
is allowed to go! No need to argue!

1390
01:51:12.875 --> 01:51:14.835 line:82%
None of you will go
to the summer camp!

1391
01:51:15.211 --> 01:51:18.589 line:82%
All right! Okay! You understand that?

1392
01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.134 line:82%
Good.

1393
01:51:36.982 --> 01:51:38.109 line:82%
You felt bad?

1394
01:51:40.611 --> 01:51:41.445 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1395
01:51:44.031 --> 01:51:45.616 line:82%
-It's okay.
-Okay.

1396
01:51:48.202 --> 01:51:51.455 line:82%
But this does not mean that you're
going to the summer camp, okay?

1397
01:51:51.539 --> 01:51:53.290 line:82%
From now on, no one is allowed
to talk about the summer camp.

1398
01:51:53.374 --> 01:51:56.252 line:82%
I'm going to the conference,
we'll talk after I come back.

1399
01:51:56.335 --> 01:51:58.170 line:82%
-Papa?
-What is it?

1400
01:51:58.838 --> 01:52:00.589 line:82%
You haven't worn your pants.

1401
01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.555 line:82%
I don't want to wear it.
Wear it if you want to.

1402
01:52:19.608 --> 01:52:20.734 line:82%
What is it?

1403
01:52:24.447 --> 01:52:26.490 line:82%
Driver take out the pant... the car.

1404
01:52:30.286 --> 01:52:35.374 line:82%
Anjali... How will we make
your father come to the camp?

1405
01:52:35.458 --> 01:52:36.667 line:82%
Come on, Grandma.

1406
01:52:36.959 --> 01:52:40.671 line:82%
Do you remember when I was four years old
and Dad was in London?

1407
01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:43.466 line:82%
And I was down with a cold and a cough.

1408
01:52:43.674 --> 01:52:44.633 line:82%
Yes, my dear.

1409
01:52:45.134 --> 01:52:48.262 line:82%
Grandma, papa left everything
and came back immediately.

1410
01:52:48.679 --> 01:52:49.889 line:82%
Then...

1411
01:52:59.064 --> 01:53:01.859 line:82%
Look, according to me this export policy
is not going to hold much water.

1412
01:53:02.359 --> 01:53:05.446 line:82%
-Sorry.
-Don't worry. It's okay.

1413
01:53:05.613 --> 01:53:07.823 line:82%
Look every expert is going

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:41.041 line:82%
Aman, why are you shouting?

1451
01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:44.003 line:82%

-Hi! I'm Rahul Khanna.
-Aman Mehra, how're you doing?

1462
01:55:11.739 --> 01:55:14.408 line:82%
I think she got confused
because names were the same.

1463
01:55:14.491 --> 01:55:18.662 line:82%
But I'm sure my Anjali is
way more beautiful than yours.

1464
01:55:19.496 --> 01:55:21.999 line:82%
-No. My Anjali is very beautiful.
-Maybe.

1465
01:55:22.166 --> 01:55:24.710 line:82%
But she can't be more beautiful
than my Anjali.

1466
01:55:25.127 --> 01:55:28.464 line:82%
-My Anjali is my eight-year-old daughter.
-Oh, shit.

1467
01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:30.966 line:82%
Then your Anjali will be more beautiful
than mine.

1468
01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:32.551 line:82%
Anyway best of luck
with your Anjali.

1469
01:55:32.676 --> 01:55:33.969 line:82%

Dear Papa,
sorry we left without informing you.

1472
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:45.481 line:82%
But you know that I like
singing and dancing very much.

1473
01:55:45.981 --> 01:55:47.816 line:82%
But I'm really sorry, Papa.

1474
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:49.902 line:82%
Don't miss me too much, okay?

1475
01:55:50.361 --> 01:55:51.654 line:82%
Love you, Anjali.

1476
01:55:52.655 --> 01:55:53.906 line:82%

The British are gone, but left Almeida.

1502
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:26.290 line:82%
-That's good.
-You are shameless!

1503
01:57:26.373 --> 01:57:29.668 line:82%

Are you counting the stars?

1529
02:00:07.242 --> 02:00:08.744 line:82%

What can I ask God for mum?

1541
02:01:07.719 --> 02:01:09.513 line:82%
-Why?

Don't call me a cheater.

1731
02:17:23.444 --> 02:17:25.863 line:82%
Hey! You're a teacher...
Cheater.

1732
02:17:31.369 --> 02:17:33.663 line:82%
Girls can't play basketball.

1733
02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:37.625 line:82%
Girls can't play basketball...

1734
02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:45.508 line:82%
Hey, give it to me.
Hey, look at the loser.

1735
02:18:53.617 --> 02:18:57.413 line:82%
There is a strange girl

1736
02:18:57.621 --> 02:19:01.250 line:82%
She is a dream
Is she for real or a story

1737
02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:04.962 line:82%
Look at this mad one
She's not changed

1738
02:19:05.463 --> 02:19:08.758 line:82%
She is still the same crazy one

1739
02:19:17.391 --> 02:19:21.020 line:82%
There is a strange boy

1740
02:19:21.312 --> 02:19:25.107 line:82%
He is a dream
Is he for real or a story?

1741

Look at this mad one
He's not changed

1742
02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:32.448 line:82%
He is still the same crazy one

1743
02:20:21.163 --> 02:20:24.792 line:82%
We were close and yet so far

1744
02:20:25.042 --> 02:20:28.337 line:82%
Those were strange circumstance

1745
02:20:29.088 --> 02:20:32.383 line:82%
Those were strange times

1746
02:20:32.716 --> 02:20:36.345 line:82%
When you were so close

1747
02:20:36.887 --> 02:20:40.558 line:82%
Where are you lost?

1748
02:20:40.641 --> 02:20:43.853 line:82%
I'm right here if only you would look

1749
02:21:58.177 --> 02:22:02.014 line:82%
I was lonesome even in a crowd

1750
02:22:02.348 --> 02:22:05.643 line:82%
You were forever in my memory

1751
02:22:06.185 --> 02:22:10.189 line:82%
If someone stops me now

1752
02:22:10.272 --> 02:22:13.192 line:82%
My heart will brim over

1753
02:22:14.151 --> 02:22:17.947 line:82%
I can't stand steady

1754
02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:21.116 line:82%
Only you can help now

1755
02:22:29.708 --> 02:22:33.337 line:82%
There is a strange girl

1756
02:22:33.754 --> 02:22:37.549 line:82%
She is a dream
Is she for real or a story

1757
02:22:37.841 --> 02:22:41.095 line:82%
Look at this mad one
He's not changed

1758
02:22:41.845 --> 02:22:44.974 line:82%
He is still the same crazy one

1759
02:23:18.257 --> 02:23:23.470 line:82%
You gave me dreams

1760
02:23:29.518 --> 02:23:33.439 line:82%
I am neither awake nor asleep

1761
02:23:37.109 --> 02:23:40.237 line:82%
Something is happening

1762
02:23:45.159 --> 02:23:48.245 line:82%
Something is happening

1763
02:23:48.787 --> 02:23:52.416 line:82%

Something is happening

1765
02:23:56.253 --> 02:24:00.090 line:82%
Okay, Nikhil, here's your letter.
And, Mamta, here's yours.

1766
02:24:00.924 --> 02:24:05.054 line:82%
Okay, kids, listen. All the mothers are
complaining that no one is replying.

1767
02:24:05.304 --> 02:24:08.766 line:82%
And I've complained to your mother
that you're not saying anything.

1768
02:24:08.932 --> 02:24:12.728 line:82%
Okay, stop that drawing, stop drawing
Stop drawing, okay.

1769
02:24:13.187 --> 02:24:16.273 line:82%
All of you will write letters
to your moms, okay?

1770
02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:20.069 line:82%
Come on, start. Pass it down.
Pass it down.

1771
02:24:20.235 --> 02:24:22.446 line:82%
Anjali, you also write to your mom.

1772
02:24:55.354 --> 02:24:56.980 line:82%
If you were here today,

1773
02:24:57.773 --> 02:25:01.985 line:82%
you could've proudly said that
Anjali is definitely your daughter.

1774
02:25:05.531 --> 02:25:07.324 line:82%
Because she's very nice.

1775
02:25:10.369 --> 02:25:13.330 line:82%
And why not?
Her name is Anjali.

1776
02:25:18.335 --> 02:25:22.172 line:82%
And do you know what's best about her?

1777
02:25:24.508 --> 02:25:26.385 line:82%
She's exactly like you.

1778
02:25:29.138 --> 02:25:32.808 line:82%
Same eyes, same face.

1779
02:25:35.519 --> 02:25:36.854 line:82%
She's just like you.

1780
02:25:54.913 --> 02:26:00.210 line:82%
Now, I don't feel like
this family is incomplete...

1781
02:26:02.421 --> 02:26:08.343 line:82%
Hi kids, good morning.
Are you ready? Say cheese.

Thank you very much.
Now a little closer.

Anjali is looking smashing
in this photo, isn't she?

1814
02:28:17.347 --> 02:28:21.602 line:82%
-Really? I didn't see her.
-Save it. I know everything.

1815
02:28:21.685 --> 02:28:25.147 line:82%
She isn't here. You're pleasing yourself
by looking at her photos.

1816
02:28:25.355 --> 02:28:26.982 line:82%
What can I do, Mother-in-law.

1817
02:28:27.482 --> 02:28:30.277 line:82%
Aman, the wedding is scheduled
for December, isn't it?

1818
02:28:30.485 --> 02:28:32.279 line:82%
Why don't you go to London and come back?

1819
02:28:32.362 --> 02:28:35.365 line:82%
-No. I'm not going anywhere.
-Why?

1820
02:28:36.241 --> 02:28:38.952 line:82%
Because I don't trust your daughter
at all.

1821
02:28:39.119 --> 02:28:41.955 line:82%
She's taken forever,
to agree for the marriage.

1822
02:28:42.164 --> 02:28:43.957 line:82%
Till the circle...
what do you call them?

1823
02:28:44.041 --> 02:28:44.958 line:82%
Tie the knot.

1824
02:28:45.042 --> 02:28:48.337 line:82%
Unitl we tie the knot,
I'm not going anywhere.

1825
02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:49.838 line:82%
Mad fellow!

1826
02:28:50.047 --> 02:28:53.717 line:82%
-You love her a lot don't you?
-No. Yes.

1827
02:28:56.637 --> 02:28:59.765 line:82%
But I think...

1828
02:29:00.724 --> 02:29:03.018 line:82%
She doesn't love me.

1829
02:29:06.980 --> 02:29:09.483 line:82%
She doesn't love me.

1830
02:29:12.194 --> 02:29:15.864 line:82%
Hey, Mother-in-law, she doesn't, right?

1831
02:29:17.574 --> 02:29:20.369 line:82%
Aman, you've gone mad.

1832
02:29:28.085 --> 02:29:29.044 line:82%
She didn't answer.

1833
02:29:30.128 --> 02:29:33.882 line:82%
Today we are going to play
a new game called charades.

1834
02:29:34.549 --> 02:29:38.178 line:82%
There are two teams
in this game. Team A.

1835
02:29:39.096 --> 02:29:40.180 line:82%
Thank you...

1836
02:29:40.430 --> 02:29:41.723 line:82%
And this is Team B.

1837
02:29:43.392 --> 02:29:44.476 line:82%
Okay, enough.

1838
02:29:44.559 --> 02:29:49.898 line:82%
In this game, one team will tell one
or two players of the other team

1839
02:29:50.273 --> 02:29:52.901 line:82%
the name of a film, silently.

1840
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:54.569 line:82%
Then the player of that team

1841
02:29:54.778 --> 02:29:59.241 line:82%
will have to describe
the name of the movie to his team

1842
02:29:59.324 --> 02:30:02.619 line:82%
without talking and only by gestures.

1843
02:30:02.703 --> 02:30:04.871 line:82%
Remember, you can't utter
a single word, okay?

1844
02:30:04.955 --> 02:30:07.374 line:82%
Simple? Let's start with the team A.

1845
02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:17.175 line:82%
-Come on.
-How would I enact it?

1846
02:30:21.555 --> 02:30:23.682 line:82%
-Come on Miss Anjali.
-Okay... okay...

1847
02:30:25.308 --> 02:30:29.980 line:82%

-You can't talk, it's cheating. Cheating.

1848
02:30:32.357 --> 02:30:34.818 line:82%
This is cheating,
you're a cheater.

1849
02:30:34.901 --> 02:30:37.279 line:82%
Okay, okay, okay...

1850
02:30:38.113 --> 02:30:40.991 line:82%
Hey, come on, my friend.
Can't you even do this? Go on.

Close your eyes.

1854
02:31:18.153 --> 02:31:19.613 line:82%
Rangeela.

1855
02:31:19.988 --> 02:31:21.281 line:82%

She agreed.

1868
02:32:05.909 --> 02:32:07.160 line:82%
You go there, go there.

1869
02:32:07.244 --> 02:32:09.371 line:82%
-Where? But why?

Hum Aapke Hain Koun.

1874
02:32:41.278 --> 02:32:43.238 line:82%
Okay, its my turn.

1875
02:32:47.993 --> 02:32:48.827 line:82%
I love you.

1876
02:32:49.202 --> 02:32:51.246 line:82%
-There's no such film like that.
-Yes, Papa, there is.

1877
02:32:51.329 --> 02:32:53.081 line:82%
No, no. No such film is there.

1878
02:32:53.164 --> 02:32:55.375 line:82%
-There is, Papa.
-I haven't seen such a film.

1879
02:32:55.458 --> 02:32:56.543 line:82%
One minute.

1880
02:32:58.378 --> 02:33:01.381 line:82%
There is. There is a film by that name.
I've seen it myself.

1881
02:33:01.464 --> 02:33:02.924 line:82%
What's the name of the film?

1882
02:33:04.134 --> 02:33:05.302 line:82%
All right, okay...

1883
02:33:14.477 --> 02:33:16.021 line:82%
Yeah... Okay...

1884
02:33:16.104 --> 02:33:18.273 line:82%
Three... Three words.

1885
02:33:25.322 --> 02:33:27.449 line:82%
Yes, I know there are three words. Next?

1886
02:33:29.242 --> 02:33:30.368 line:82%
I can't do it.

1887
02:33:30.994 --> 02:33:34.289 line:82%
-Rahul, what are you doing?
-Your son has gone mad.

1888
02:33:37.918 --> 02:33:40.670 line:82%
Rahul, I can't understand anything.
What are you doing?

1889
02:33:43.632 --> 02:33:46.134 line:82%
Come on, Rahul,
now... No... Now.

1890
02:33:51.473 --> 02:33:54.392 line:82%
Yeah, what is it? What?

1891
02:34:02.025 --> 02:34:05.153 line:82%
I love you.
How to act it out?

1892
02:34:11.534 --> 02:34:12.994 line:82%
Do it again.

1893
02:34:16.998 --> 02:34:18.875 line:82%
No... No... No... No...
He's doing it wrong.

1894
02:34:19.042 --> 02:34:20.085 line:82%
I love you.

1895
02:34:25.882 --> 02:34:26.967 line:82%
I love you.

1896
02:34:27.759 --> 02:34:29.094 line:82%
You couldn't do that?

1897
02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:31.346 line:82%
Couldn't...

1898
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:33.515 line:82%
If you did, we would have won.

1899
02:34:39.688 --> 02:34:42.524 line:82%
Oh, God! Come on kids, to the barn.

1900
02:34:42.941 --> 02:34:47.696 line:82%
Run, Nikhil. Come on.
Come on. Faster.

1901
02:34:53.243 --> 02:34:54.703 line:82%
Come on, faster.

1902
02:35:01.334 --> 02:35:03.128 line:82%
Give me that. Okay, thanks.

1903
02:35:11.302 --> 02:35:13.096 line:82%
Have you gone crazy? Stupid.

1904
02:35:14.514 --> 02:35:15.974 line:82%
-Anjali.
-Yes?

1905
02:35:16.766 --> 02:35:18.226 line:82%
I'm feeling very cold.

1906
02:35:21.146 --> 02:35:23.148 line:82%
Come with me,
I'll take you somewhere.

1907
02:35:23.231 --> 02:35:24.607 line:82%
But...

1908
02:35:52.135 --> 02:35:53.219 line:82%
No music.

1909
02:38:37.091 --> 02:38:40.511 line:82%
I love you. I love you.

1910
02:38:40.595 --> 02:38:45.308 line:82%
I love you so much. I really love you.

1911
02:38:45.808 --> 02:38:47.727 line:82%
Hey, I love you, too.

1912
02:38:56.402 --> 02:38:59.030 line:82%
Almeda, can't you plug
the leakage properly. Go.

1913
02:38:59.447 --> 02:39:02.617 line:82%
-Anjali.
-Mom. Did Anjali come here?

1914
02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:05.078 line:82%
-She is sitting here.
-Not this one, the other one.

1915
02:39:05.161 --> 02:39:06.955 line:82%
You help him up there.

1916
02:39:07.038 --> 02:39:08.289 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Anjali...

1917
02:39:10.917 --> 02:39:11.960 line:82%
Rahul, I...

1918
02:39:12.293 --> 02:39:15.880 line:82%
Anjali, I wanted to talk to you.

1919
02:39:16.422 --> 02:39:19.384 line:82%
Actually, I wanted to talk to you there,
but you suddenly...

1920
02:39:23.721 --> 02:39:25.348 line:82%
This stable is your summer camp?

1921
02:39:27.725 --> 02:39:31.271 line:82%
Hi, guys! Hey, I know you.

1922
02:39:32.063 --> 02:39:35.358 line:82%
From where...
Yes, telephone man.

1923
02:39:36.067 --> 02:39:37.110 line:82%
Yeah.

1924
02:39:37.735 --> 02:39:38.695 line:82%
What's up, dude?

1925
02:39:39.070 --> 02:39:41.030 line:82%
But what are you doing in this stable?

1926
02:39:41.906 --> 02:39:45.702 line:82%
Hey, is this your Anjali?

1927
02:39:52.083 --> 02:39:53.668 line:82%
This is my Anjali.

1928
02:39:56.587 --> 02:39:59.382 line:82%
And this is my Anjali.

1929
02:40:16.941 --> 02:40:19.402 line:82%
Wow... Amazing man, too good.

1930
02:40:19.610 --> 02:40:21.571 line:82%
Just like Michael Jordan!
My friend, you're too good.

1931
02:40:21.654 --> 02:40:23.239 line:82%
I'm not that good.

1932
02:40:23.323 --> 02:40:25.241 line:82%
-I've lost.
-Lost?

1933
02:40:25.450 --> 02:40:27.535 line:82%
I don't believe this, friend,
not possible.

1934
02:40:27.618 --> 02:40:28.911 line:82%
Okay, tell me, who won?

1935
02:40:29.579 --> 02:40:32.290 line:82%
-Anjali.
-Your Anjali?

1936
02:40:34.292 --> 02:40:37.670 line:82%
-Your Anjali.
-My Anjali? In basketball?

1937
02:40:39.630 --> 02:40:42.425 line:82%
Tell me something.
You were with her in college, right?

1938
02:40:43.134 --> 02:40:46.262 line:82%
How was she?
Who were her friends? I want to know...

1939
02:40:46.346 --> 02:40:50.266 line:82%
She was the life and pride our college.
Everybody took their problems to her.

1940
02:40:51.142 --> 02:40:52.352 line:82%
Nothing has changed.

1941
02:40:52.643 --> 02:40:55.355 line:82%
Even I've come to her with my problem.

1942
02:40:56.981 --> 02:40:58.107 line:82%
What is your problem?

1943
02:41:00.151 --> 02:41:04.113 line:82%
My problem is that I love her
very much, you know?

1944
02:41:04.364 --> 02:41:06.991 line:82%
-I know.
-You know...

1945
02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:11.287 line:82%
What kind of friend are you?

1946
02:41:11.871 --> 02:41:14.248 line:82%
You didn't even come for our engagement.

1947
02:41:14.332 --> 02:41:15.666 line:82%
You're engaged?

1948
02:41:18.044 --> 02:41:23.549 line:82%
Yes, but with great difficulty.
The wedding is in December, I think.

1949
02:41:25.510 --> 02:41:30.139 line:82%
Hey! Tell your friend if she doesn't marry
me in December...

1950
02:41:30.473 --> 02:41:35.520 line:82%
Then... I'll marry this basketball.

1951
02:41:35.603 --> 02:41:37.146 line:82%
Marry the basketball?

1952
02:41:38.022 --> 02:41:40.024 line:82%
-See you, dude.
-Okay, dude

1953
02:41:40.108 --> 02:41:41.651 line:82%
-Basketball?
-Bye.

1954
02:41:53.538 --> 02:41:56.833 line:82%
We live once, we die once,

1955
02:41:57.708 --> 02:42:01.504 line:82%
we get married once, we also love...

1956
02:42:14.016 --> 02:42:14.851 line:82%
Anjali.

1957
02:42:18.896 --> 02:42:20.690 line:82%
Men are very weak...

1958
02:42:22.567 --> 02:42:23.860 line:82%
They are very weak...

1959
02:42:25.903 --> 02:42:27.530 line:82%
They make principles...

1960
02:42:28.573 --> 02:42:32.535 line:82%
But they forget that no principle
can override the heart.

1961
02:42:34.245 --> 02:42:38.791 line:82%
And we make these obstinate,
fragile men realize,

1962
02:42:39.917 --> 02:42:44.213 line:82%
bonds of the heart are based
on feelings not principles.

1963
02:42:46.757 --> 02:42:48.968 line:82%
But these bonds
are created by telling the

1964
02:42:49.051 --> 02:42:51.137 line:82%
other person about one's inner feelings.

1965
02:42:55.933 --> 02:42:58.561 line:82%
Tell him what you feel, Anjali.

1966
02:43:02.773 --> 02:43:06.819 line:82%
Sometimes saying what one feels
can break one's heart.

1967
02:43:08.279 --> 02:43:11.282 line:82%
But by not saying it you won't,
be happy.

1968
02:43:12.617 --> 02:43:14.035 line:82%
You won't be happy.

1969
02:43:22.376 --> 02:43:25.880 line:82%
Congratulations and celebrations

1970
02:43:25.963 --> 02:43:29.592 line:82%
We wish Miss Anjali
A happy wedded life

1971
02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:33.930 line:82%
Congratulations
Congratulations and celebrations

1972
02:43:36.307 --> 02:43:38.434 line:82%
What is this, Anjali?
You didn't even tell me.

1973
02:43:38.643 --> 02:43:40.436 line:82%
Aman told me that you're getting...

1974
02:43:40.978 --> 02:43:43.189 line:82%
Hey, congratulations.

1975
02:43:44.315 --> 02:43:47.777 line:82%
You're happy, aren't you?
You're happy, aren't you?

1976
02:43:48.986 --> 02:43:50.863 line:82%
Having heard this, are you happy?

1977
02:43:51.739 --> 02:43:52.865 line:82%
I'm very happy.

1978
02:43:54.325 --> 02:43:58.621 line:82%
-Then how can I be happy?
-I don't understand.

1979
02:44:01.666 --> 02:44:05.628 line:82%
Something happens, Rahul.
You won't understand.

1980
02:44:14.262 --> 02:44:18.641 line:82%
Something happens, Anjali.
You won't understand.

1981
02:44:26.357 --> 02:44:27.817 line:82%
-Uncle?
-Yes?

1982
02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:29.860 line:82%
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

1983
02:44:30.194 --> 02:44:33.155 line:82%
Why are you marrying Miss Anjali?

1984
02:44:33.489 --> 02:44:36.951 line:82%
-What? Why? Anything wrong?
-Yes.

1985
02:44:37.159 --> 02:44:39.370 line:82%
-See, it's very simple.
-Explain.

1986
02:44:39.954 --> 02:44:41.247 line:82%
You're so handsome.

1987
02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:44.667 line:82%
-What happened?
-So good-looking.

1988
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:46.711 line:82%
Oh! Thank you so much.

1989
02:44:47.378 --> 02:44:50.339 line:82%
But Miss Anjali doesn't look so good.
Very bad.

1990
02:44:51.549 --> 02:44:55.511 line:82%
You know you're right.
She's dark, fat, short.

1991
02:44:56.762 --> 02:44:59.724 line:82%
Yes. You can get any girl you want.

1992
02:45:00.057 --> 02:45:02.018 line:82%
-I can get any girl I want?
-Yes.

1993
02:45:02.602 --> 02:45:06.397 line:82%
-Will you marry me?
-Me? No, no, no.

1994
02:45:06.731 --> 02:45:07.940 line:82%
Why? Am I that bad?

1995
02:45:10.192 --> 02:45:12.820 line:82%
Then, you'll have to find
a nice girl for me.

1996
02:45:13.029 --> 02:45:14.822 line:82%
-I've found someone.
-Who?

1997
02:45:14.905 --> 02:45:15.948 line:82%
That one.

1998
02:45:21.537 --> 02:45:22.663 line:82%
That MTV girl.

1999
02:45:22.872 --> 02:45:25.333 line:82%
Hi, this is
Neelam show,
yo.

2000
02:45:26.834 --> 02:45:30.379 line:82%
Then what will happen to this Anjali?
You'll have to find someone for her.

2001
02:45:30.463 --> 02:45:32.965 line:82%
-I've found someone.
-Have you?

2002
02:45:33.049 --> 02:45:34.634 line:82%
-Should I say who?
-No, no.

2003
02:45:34.717 --> 02:45:36.260 line:82%
-I'm gonna tell you.
-No, no, no.

2004
02:45:36.344 --> 02:45:39.263 line:82%
-No, no, I'm gonna tell you.
-No, no, no. Please, no...

2005
02:45:39.347 --> 02:45:42.516 line:82%
Aman, I want to go back tonight.

2006
02:46:25.851 --> 02:46:27.228 line:82%
Goodbye, Mr. Almeda.

2007
02:47:07.518 --> 02:47:08.519 line:82%
You're leaving?

2008
02:47:13.357 --> 02:47:14.900 line:82%
Please don't go.

2009
02:47:45.181 --> 02:47:46.015 line:82%
Anjali...

2010
02:48:27.264 --> 02:48:32.228 line:82%
You gave this to Tina,
when she was going to start a new life.

2011
02:48:36.106 --> 02:48:38.317 line:82%
You are also starting a new life today.

2012
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:44.156 line:82%
I know,

2013
02:48:46.408 --> 02:48:48.869 line:82%
that you and Rahul
will be very happy together.

2014
02:48:51.622 --> 02:48:54.375 line:82%
Aman, Aman.

2015
02:48:58.546 --> 02:48:59.380 line:82%
Aman.

2016
02:49:03.467 --> 02:49:07.638 line:82%
Oh, my love

2017
02:49:07.721 --> 02:49:12.726 line:82%
Oh, my love

2018
02:49:12.935 --> 02:49:18.315 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

2019
02:49:19.275 --> 02:49:24.363 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

2020
02:49:25.364 --> 02:49:28.409 line:82%
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

2021
02:49:28.492 --> 02:49:31.036 line:82%
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

2022
02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:34.456 line:82%
There's nothing more left to say

2023
02:49:34.582 --> 02:49:40.337 line:82%
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

2024
02:49:42.923 --> 02:49:45.384 line:82%
Please make arrangements
for the wedding.

2025
02:49:45.843 --> 02:49:47.553 line:82%
I don't want to wait any longer.

2026
02:49:47.887 --> 02:49:51.932 line:82%
But, Anjali, Guruji said that there's no
auspicious date before December.

2027
02:49:52.016 --> 02:49:53.309 line:82%
Mom!

2028
02:49:54.226 --> 02:49:57.271 line:82%
Mother, dates don't bring
happiness, destiny does...

2029
02:49:59.064 --> 02:50:01.025 line:82%
...and no one can change that.

2030
02:51:20.604 --> 02:51:23.315 line:82%
Look! Aman's here and
that too on a mule.

Greetings.

I know.

2036
02:51:45.337 --> 02:51:47.464 line:82%
Anjali is getting married?

2037
02:51:49.216 --> 02:51:54.388 line:82%
Yes. Anjali made such a hasty decision
to get married

2038
02:51:54.596 --> 02:51:57.474 line:82%
that I didn't get time
to fully prepare for it.

2039
02:51:59.059 --> 02:52:03.439 line:82%
I'm coming. Please sit down.

2040

02:52:19.872 --> 02:52:21.290 line:82%

Anjali...

2045
02:54:36.091 --> 02:54:41.597 line:82%
I had faith in you
But still I was restless

2046
02:54:45.893 --> 02:54:51.273 line:82%
I had faith in you
But still I was restless

2047
02:54:52.649 --> 02:54:58.155 line:82%
I waited for you for years

2048
02:54:59.448 --> 02:55:05.162 line:82%
But still you never
Said anything then

2049
02:55:05.787 --> 02:55:08.874 line:82%
What you said now

2050
02:55:09.416 --> 02:55:15.088 line:82%
My heart in a helpless state
Cries quietly

2051
02:55:16.173 --> 02:55:18.425 line:82%
What am I to do?

2052
02:55:19.301 --> 02:55:22.054 line:82%
Something is happening

2053
02:55:22.804 --> 02:55:28.393 line:82%
What am I to do?
Something is happening

2054
02:55:54.336 --> 02:55:57.297 line:82%

02:55:57.673 --> 02:55:58.507 line:82%
Anjali.

2056
02:56:02.386 --> 02:56:05.722 line:82%
The auspicious time is almost
over, please call the bride.

2057
02:56:08.141 --> 02:56:09.351 line:82%
Anjali, let's go.

2058
02:57:00.193 --> 02:57:03.613 line:82%
I'll drag you to the marriage
pandal, I told you, didn't I?

2059
02:58:00.504 --> 02:58:01.338 line:82%
Aman...

2060
02:58:02.881 --> 02:58:04.091 line:82%
You know,

2061
02:58:05.092 --> 02:58:07.844 line:82%
I always wanted to see
that love in your eyes...

2062
02:58:08.762 --> 02:58:10.389 line:82%
...that I have in mine.

2063
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:14.101 line:82%
I've seen that love today.

2064
02:58:16.853 --> 02:58:18.438 line:82%
But it is not for me.

2065
02:58:20.399 --> 02:58:21.525 line:82%
You're crazy, Anjali.

2066
02:58:23.735 --> 02:58:25.695 line:82%
You've only loved him.

2067
02:58:27.823 --> 02:58:31.410 line:82%
Ever since you've understood
and known what love is.

2068

You've only loved him.

2069

Rahul is your first love.

2070
02:58:40.752 --> 02:58:44.840 line:82%
And no one understands first love
more than I do.

2071
02:58:49.553 --> 02:58:53.223 line:82%
You were going to give this
all up for me?

2072
02:58:54.641 --> 02:58:55.851 line:82%
Stupid!

2073
02:58:58.478 --> 02:59:00.480 line:82%
How can l come between this love...

02:59:03.650 --> 02:59:05.944 line:82%
...that was never mine in the first place?

2075
02:59:10.824 --> 02:59:12.617 line:82%
And anyway, someone told me that...

2076
02:59:13.618 --> 02:59:16.079 line:82%
...I'm so handsome, I can get anyone.

2077
