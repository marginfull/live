00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:18.097 line:82%
Sir! Sir!

2
00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:23.644 line:82%
A girl is bringing in a severed head, sir.

3
00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:52.382 line:82%
It hasn't even been six months
since Radha killed Tirupati.

4
00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:54.175 line:82%
What's this again, sir?

5
00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.284 line:82%
-Sir, Greetings!
-Hey, Ramesh.

6
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.078 line:82%
-Is everything ready?
-Yes, everything is ready.

7
00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:25.289 line:82%
What's his name?

8
00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:28.543 line:82%
Hey, Tirupati!

9
00:03:32.672 --> 00:03:33.881 line:82%
How did he die?

10
00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:41.597 line:82%
Seriously?!
His wife chopped his head off?

11
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.897 line:82%
What on earth did he do
to end up this way?

12
00:03:50.023 --> 00:03:51.399 line:82%
Didn't you read the newspaper?

13
00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:55.653 line:82%
Odela Tirupati would abduct brides on
wedding nights to rape and murder them.

14
00:03:59.032 --> 00:04:01.617 line:82%
Why did he do it?
How did he get caught?

15
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.796 line:82%
She did the right thing.
She took his life and protected the town.

16
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.642 line:82%
Name is Tirupati, and he is from Odela.
Anyone related to him?

17
00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.545 line:82%
Mayanna!

18
00:04:58.297 --> 00:04:59.548 line:82%
Brother... Brother!

19
00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:03.386 line:82%
Brother...
They brought home Tirupati's body.

20
00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:11.477 line:82%
Tirupati!

21
00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.312 line:82%
My son!

22
00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:17.024 line:82%
Tirupati, my son!

23
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:20.278 line:82%
Hey, Ravi! We brought home
Tirupati's body. Please come home.

24
00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.241 line:82%
No relative is turning up.

25
00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:26.367 line:82%
Hello!

26
00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.202 line:82%
None of your friends
have come to see you.

27
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.746 line:82%
What kind of death is this?

28
00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.978 line:82%
Look closely.

29
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.939 line:82%
This idiot ruined our village's name.

30
00:05:57.064 --> 00:05:59.609 line:82%
He ended the lives of our children.

31
00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.945 line:82%
His soul shouldn't rest in peace.

32
00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.365 line:82%
His life shouldn't transcend to the next.

33
00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:10.411 line:82%
The punishment we
impose on his dead body,

34
00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:15.041 line:82%
must be remembered by all
for as long as the nearby villages exist.

35
00:06:19.086 --> 00:06:20.880 line:82%
There is only one way to do it.

36
00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:24.550 line:82%
Burial punishment.

37
00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:32.099 line:82%
Which means?

38
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:35.019 line:82%
What do we do when
a family member dies, Raja Reddy?

39
00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:37.855 line:82%
We either bury them or burn them.

40
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.274 line:82%
But we shouldn't do that with his body.

41
00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:42.360 line:82%
On the upcoming new moon day,

42
00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:44.320 line:82%
at 6 am,

43
00:06:44.528 --> 00:06:47.573 line:82%
we must place his body vertically,

44
00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:50.868 line:82%
then drench his body
with black hen's blood.

45
00:06:51.118 --> 00:06:54.497 line:82%
Take the villagers' fingernail clippings,
sand from beneath their feet,

46
00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.333 line:82%
a piece of their clothing,
and a black thread.

47
00:06:57.375 --> 00:07:02.588 line:82%
All these must be tied in a black cloth
and buried alongside his body.

48
00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:06.592 line:82%
That is called burial punishment.

49
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.594 line:82%
Then...

50
00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.139 line:82%
his soul will suffer just like we did.

51
00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.562 line:82%
Tirupati's soul will struggle
without transcending.

52
00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:19.855 line:82%
It will experience hell.

53
00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:21.315 line:82%
But Mayanna,

54
00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:23.985 line:82%
why punish a dead body?

55
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:29.365 line:82%
You would understand if you
had lost a sister or mother to him.

56
00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:32.410 line:82%
True, he should get the burial punishment.

57
00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.288 line:82%
Raju, you heard the priest's plan, right?

58
00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:37.123 line:82%
-I did.
-The whole village should hear this.

59
00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:39.292 line:82%
Hear one, hear all!

60
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:42.295 line:82%
At the banyan tree
near the Goddess temple,

61
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:45.881 line:82%
right where we bury pigs and cows,

62
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:50.136 line:82%
Tirupati's body will
receive burial punishment!

63
00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.660 line:82%
Tailor Sreenu...

64
00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:17.163 line:82%
It's me, your friend.

65
00:08:17.204 --> 00:08:19.582 line:82%
We studied together during childhood.

66
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.626 line:82%
Give me a helping hand.

67
00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.839 line:82%
Brother is lifting on his own.

68
00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.174 line:82%
Hey!

69
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.970 line:82%
Narsi! Narsi!

70
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.222 line:82%
At least you lend them a hand...

71
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.670 line:82%
Brother.

72
00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.464 line:82%
Brother is dead.

73
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.967 line:82%
Sister-in-law is in jail.

74
00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.261 line:82%
The family has fallen apart.

75
00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.012 line:82%
Why such injustice?

76
00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:16.430 line:82%
Brother.

77
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.266 line:82%
Ask them to let him go!

78
00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:21.435 line:82%
Isn't it because of your brother
the village suffered?

79
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.563 line:82%
What are you guys looking at?
Throw him out!

80
00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:26.440 line:82%
-Give it a second thought!
-Please don't!

81
00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.279 line:82%
Brother, ask them to stop.

82
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.115 line:82%
Please stop it.

83
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.325 line:82%
Please don't, I beg you.

84
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.077 line:82%
I committed a mistake unknowingly.

85
00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.664 line:82%
My wife killed me
and has punished me enough already.

86
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:46.711 line:82%
Let these sins be accounted for
and end in this lifetime

87
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:48.879 line:82%
Let it go.

88
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:52.300 line:82%
Why are you guys punishing a dead body?

89
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.095 line:82%
Why give burial punishment to someone
who's already been killed?

90
00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:58.180 line:82%
Guys, get it over with.

91
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.266 line:82%
Guys, please don't!

92
00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.770 line:82%
Don't. Don't.

93
00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.480 line:82%
-Don't!
-Don't!

94
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:13.863 line:82%
Please burn my body.
I don't want this burial punishment.

95
00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:16.324 line:82%
Please burn me.

96
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:21.120 line:82%
Don't. Don't. Don't.

97
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.497 line:82%
Hey!

98
00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.003 line:82%
You all made a mistake.

99
00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:14.257 line:82%
You guys are committing a grave sin!

100
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:17.843 line:82%
You’ve made a huge mistake!

101
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.897 line:82%
Sreenu! Narsi!

102
00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.900 line:82%
You... You...

103
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.027 line:82%
I won't spare any one of you!

104
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.617 line:82%
I'll bring panic to every doorstep!

105
00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:46.747 line:82%
I will fill every house with cries!

106
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:54.005 line:82%
I will make sure Rahu
and Kethu to dance to my tunes!

107
00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:59.218 line:82%
Wedding songs will
turn into funeral hymns.

108
00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:05.349 line:82%
From now on, you'll be destroyed
and this village will be annihilated!

109
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:11.731 line:82%
Not even the Lord Odela Mallanna
will be able to save you!

110
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:18.362 line:82%
I won't spare you!

111
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.198 line:82%
I won't spare you!

112
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.285 line:82%
I won't spare you!

113
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:48.309 line:82%
In the Indian subcontinent,

114
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.061 line:82%
to the southeast of Mokshapuri,

115
00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:54.273 line:82%
around 1000 km away,
along the southern banks of Ganga...

116
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:59.320 line:82%
an evil spirit is surfacing
in the God's birthplace, Odela.

117
00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:04.367 line:82%
It's collecting every drop
of blood that can be found

118
00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:06.452 line:82%
and waiting for an opportunity.

119
00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:09.080 line:82%
If it was visible to your inner eye,

120
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.624 line:82%
I think complete destruction
is inevitable,
Gurudeva.

121
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.669 line:82%
Destruction is
the terrifying form of time.

122
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.797 line:82%
If an evil spirit is born there,

123
00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:21.384 line:82%
then God must have also
taken an earthly form elsewhere.

124
00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:23.928 line:82%
God is the only eternal truth!

Will you listen to me?

-Share with your husband.
-Thanks, sister.

148
00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:29.942 line:82%
Veralingaiah uncle!

149
00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:32.862 line:82%
What is it, Raji Reddy?

150
00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:36.282 line:82%
Why are you dancing in the dust with kids?
Come here. You might fall sick.

151
00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:37.617 line:82%
What do you mean?

152
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:40.453 line:82%
Does it look like dust?

153
00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:46.417 line:82%
To me, it looks like
the ash on the Goddess Odela.

154
00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.044 line:82%
I don't understand. Speak clearly.

155
00:18:48.178 --> 00:18:49.304 line:82%
How many days has it been

156
00:18:49.387 --> 00:18:52.432 line:82%
since we saw a wedding
gathering in our village?

157
00:18:52.682 --> 00:18:58.313 line:82%
Only Lord Mallana knows how much
I suffered these past six months.

158
00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:05.570 line:82%
Our village is finally at peace
after Tirupati's death.

159
00:19:05.654 --> 00:19:06.488 line:82%
Yes.

160
00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:22.295 line:82%
Hey, Priest! I'm talking to you.

161
00:19:23.255 --> 00:19:25.549 line:82%
-Who is it?
-Come, let's have a drink.

162
00:19:25.882 --> 00:19:27.425 line:82%
Oh! You guys!

163
00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:28.510 line:82%
I'm coming!

164
00:19:31.138 --> 00:19:34.516 line:82%
What's this?
Why do you always settle under the tree?

165
00:19:34.724 --> 00:19:36.726 line:82%
Local brew by day,
branded liquor by night?

166
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.270 line:82%
Have this.

167
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.982 line:82%
I must fix an auspicious time
for his sister-in-law's wedding night.

168
00:19:54.369 --> 00:19:55.662 line:82%
This was a little too strong.

169
00:19:55.745 --> 00:19:58.039 line:82%
You knew I liked her since childhood,

170
00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:00.041 line:82%
yet you saw to it that
she got married happily!

171
00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:01.877 line:82%
Look at you!

172
00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:05.755 line:82%
Ask your uncle Maika Raji Reddy, who
sold six acres to get a U.S. return groom.

173
00:20:05.797 --> 00:20:08.216 line:82%
I just chant mantras for 30 minutes.
There's no use yelling at me.

174
00:20:08.258 --> 00:20:09.718 line:82%
That's just my fate!

175
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:12.554 line:82%
In childhood, when Yamini cried,

176
00:20:12.804 --> 00:20:15.098 line:82%
I used to wipe her nose with my shirt.

177
00:20:15.182 --> 00:20:16.725 line:82%
When she wanted tamarind,
I’d smash it open for her.

178
00:20:16.808 --> 00:20:18.477 line:82%
When she asked for Jujube fruits,
I'd got them for her.

179
00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:20.520 line:82%
When she wanted guava,
I'd cut it for her.

180
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.356 line:82%
Now got all ready,
looking as fresh as an apple!

181
00:20:25.192 --> 00:20:26.651 line:82%
How can I give her up?

182
00:20:27.027 --> 00:20:29.696 line:82%
We grow plants at home.

183
00:20:29.946 --> 00:20:31.364 line:82%
But offer the flowers to God.

184
00:20:31.782 --> 00:20:34.618 line:82%
Your uncle set up a buffalo farm
for you because you weren't studious.

185
00:20:34.785 --> 00:20:35.952 line:82%
The buffaloes are ours.

186
00:20:36.495 --> 00:20:38.205 line:82%
But we sell the milk to the hotel.

187
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:39.873 line:82%
-That's it.
-Yes, uncle.

188
00:20:39.956 --> 00:20:41.917 line:82%
Dubai Shankar is in Dubai.

189
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.085 line:82%
I'm going to his home every day.

190
00:20:44.252 --> 00:20:46.505 line:82%
That doesn't make her my wife!

191
00:20:48.465 --> 00:20:50.717 line:82%
You discard your shirt at home
and your
lungi
outside!

192
00:20:51.092 --> 00:20:53.970 line:82%
But I'm ready to sacrifice
my life for her.

193
00:20:56.556 --> 00:20:57.974 line:82%
I planted that mango tree.

194
00:20:58.225 --> 00:20:59.434 line:82%
Am I not eating those mangoes?

195
00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:02.854 line:82%
I planted
chitti mutyala
rice at the farm,
am I not reaping the benefits?

196
00:21:03.188 --> 00:21:04.856 line:82%
But I won't leave her.

197
00:21:05.816 --> 00:21:07.317 line:82%
What do we do now?

198
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.486 line:82%
Haven't you seen
those web series on OTTs?

199
00:21:09.653 --> 00:21:11.071 line:82%
A dead person comes back to life.

200
00:21:11.722 --> 00:21:13.391 line:82%
I'll rape her.

201
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.311 line:82%
I'll make them believe that
dead Tirupati is the culprit.

202
00:21:17.478 --> 00:21:18.479 line:82%
Hey!

203
00:21:19.063 --> 00:21:20.523 line:82%
What nonsense are you talking about?

204
00:21:20.564 --> 00:21:22.358 line:82%
Don’t blurt out outrageous things
just because you're drunk.

205
00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:25.236 line:82%
I don't want your alcohol
or your friendship!

206
00:21:28.155 --> 00:21:30.950 line:82%
[together] Priest uncle!

207
00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:33.911 line:82%
[all] Priest!

208
00:21:44.588 --> 00:21:48.092 line:82%
Every time I drink something,
and I instantly need to pee!

209
00:21:55.766 --> 00:21:56.726 line:82%
Come!

210
00:22:17.455 --> 00:22:18.372 line:82%
Come!

211
00:22:18.622 --> 00:22:22.710 line:82%
I’ll make you
live through burial punishment!

212
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.879 line:82%
I'll show you!

213
00:23:59.557 --> 00:24:00.558 line:82%
What's this, Priest?

214
00:24:00.808 --> 00:24:03.144 line:82%
I thought you'd bless the girl
and send them inside.

215
00:24:03.185 --> 00:24:04.603 line:82%
Why did you switch off your phone?

216
00:24:04.645 --> 00:24:06.689 line:82%
My phone ran out of battery.

217
00:24:07.481 --> 00:24:08.858 line:82%
Everything is over for you.

218
00:24:09.191 --> 00:24:11.694 line:82%
These guys are very eager
to get on with it!

219
00:24:12.778 --> 00:24:16.824 line:82%
Bless them and send them
in before it’s too late!

220
00:24:45.227 --> 00:24:48.147 line:82%
May everything you desire be fulfilled.

221
00:24:49.398 --> 00:24:51.859 line:82%
Priest, take those vegetables and rice.

222
00:24:52.943 --> 00:24:54.028 line:82%
Okay.

223
00:25:25.184 --> 00:25:26.852 line:82%
Wow, baby!

224
00:25:27.061 --> 00:25:29.313 line:82%
Is this skin or silk?

225
00:25:29.897 --> 00:25:32.024 line:82%
You are slipping away from my grasp.

226
00:25:32.525 --> 00:25:33.985 line:82%
You are gorgeous!

227
00:25:34.318 --> 00:25:36.153 line:82%
Don't you have even one birthmark?

228
00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:37.947 line:82%
Why only one?

229
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.533 line:82%
There are nine!

230
00:25:40.658 --> 00:25:42.076 line:82%
Nine birthmarks?!

231
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:46.330 line:82%
Then, I'll start my romance with counting!

232
00:25:48.874 --> 00:25:51.961 line:82%
The first on the lower lip.

233
00:25:54.547 --> 00:25:56.882 line:82%
The second one is on the neck.

234
00:25:57.299 --> 00:25:59.301 line:82%
Third, on the armpit.

235
00:25:59.593 --> 00:26:01.762 line:82%
The fourth one is below.

236
00:26:02.096 --> 00:26:04.890 line:82%
The fifth one is a mole on the navel.

237
00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:09.437 line:82%
The sixth one is on the hip curve.

238
00:26:11.188 --> 00:26:13.774 line:82%
The seventh is on the left.

239
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.611 line:82%
Where is the eighth one?

240
00:26:17.987 --> 00:26:21.532 line:82%
I found it!
Eighth one on your back!

241
00:26:23.743 --> 00:26:25.286 line:82%
And ninth?

242
00:26:25.578 --> 00:26:27.455 line:82%
You are wrong. There are only eight.

243
00:26:28.664 --> 00:26:30.541 line:82%
I searched harder than Google!

244
00:26:30.583 --> 00:26:32.793 line:82%
No! There are nine of them.

245
00:26:33.002 --> 00:26:34.295 line:82%
Accept that you are a loser.

246
00:26:34.503 --> 00:26:36.172 line:82%
Then, I'll reveal the ninth--

247
00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:47.058 line:82%
Hey, Priest!
Have you lost your mind?

248
00:26:47.183 --> 00:26:48.476 line:82%
Why did you come into the room?

249
00:26:54.857 --> 00:26:57.109 line:82%
Have you lost your senses?
What's with the look?

250
00:26:57.693 --> 00:26:59.820 line:82%
Will you make us do it
under your supervision? Leave!

251
00:27:00.071 --> 00:27:01.572 line:82%
Get out!

252
00:27:03.491 --> 00:27:04.450 line:82%
Go!

253
00:27:16.212 --> 00:27:18.756 line:82%
Hey, Priest! Do you know
what you are doing?

254
00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:20.591 line:82%
If my dad finds out, he'll kill you.

255
00:27:20.716 --> 00:27:23.135 line:82%
How can a dead person die again?!

256
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.598 line:82%
What do you mean?

257
00:27:29.392 --> 00:27:31.310 line:82%
Tirupati!

258
00:28:14.854 --> 00:28:20.026 line:82%
You two were talking about
something before I got here.

259
00:28:21.485 --> 00:28:23.279 line:82%
Tell me what it is.

260
00:28:24.196 --> 00:28:25.364 line:82%
Tell me!

261
00:28:26.574 --> 00:28:27.950 line:82%
Tell me!

262
00:28:30.536 --> 00:28:32.204 line:82%
Tell me what it is.

263
00:28:42.298 --> 00:28:43.674 line:82%
Tell me!

264
00:28:47.637 --> 00:28:49.013 line:82%
Tell me.

265
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.932 line:82%
I told him I have nine birthmarks.

266
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:54.769 line:82%
He counted one by one
and found eight of them.

267
00:28:56.812 --> 00:28:59.357 line:82%
I'll tell you where the ninth one is!

268
00:29:02.902 --> 00:29:04.403 line:82%
One.

269
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.490 line:82%
I'll leave. Let me go.

270
00:29:07.948 --> 00:29:09.325 line:82%
I'll leave.

271
00:29:49.156 --> 00:29:51.450 line:82%
Mika Raji Reddy brother!

272
00:30:44.378 --> 00:30:46.672 line:82%
Move! Leave way.

273
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:52.011 line:82%
Hey! Take him to the hospital.

274
00:30:52.094 --> 00:30:55.056 line:82%
-I want to talk to sir.
-Send the body for a post-mortem.

275
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:57.141 line:82%
-Let me go.
-Send the evidence to forensics.

276
00:30:57.308 --> 00:30:59.185 line:82%
-Hey! What happened?
-Sir.

277
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.729 line:82%
I don't know, sir.

278
00:31:02.355 --> 00:31:04.398 line:82%
I forgot my mobile phone.

279
00:31:04.649 --> 00:31:06.609 line:82%
I came back to get it.

280
00:31:07.526 --> 00:31:09.028 line:82%
There was chaos inside.

281
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:11.364 line:82%
When I went in to check,

282
00:31:11.989 --> 00:31:13.866 line:82%
the girl was dead, sir!

283
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:16.452 line:82%
-Did you see anyone?
-I didn't see anyone, I swear on my mom!

284
00:31:16.535 --> 00:31:17.370 line:82%
Oh!

285
00:31:17.995 --> 00:31:20.039 line:82%
-You didn't see anyone?
-No, sir.

286
00:31:20.665 --> 00:31:21.832 line:82%
You saw no one in the house?

287
00:31:22.333 --> 00:31:24.043 line:82%
Hey! Put the priest in the jeep.

288
00:31:24.752 --> 00:31:27.713 line:82%
Please let me go, sir.
I'm innocent.

289
00:31:33.344 --> 00:31:35.054 line:82%
I swear on my mother, sir!
I’m innocent.

290
00:31:38.724 --> 00:31:41.268 line:82%
No, sir. Don't!

291
00:31:41.852 --> 00:31:45.898 line:82%
Sir, I promise I didn't do anything.

292
00:31:46.273 --> 00:31:48.567 line:82%
-I didn't do anything, sir.
-Who did it?

293
00:31:48.693 --> 00:31:49.944 line:82%
Who's responsible?

294
00:31:50.861 --> 00:31:53.030 line:82%
If you pull the hair,
you could pull out a handful.

295
00:31:53.072 --> 00:31:54.699 line:82%
How did you pull off the scalp?

296
00:32:04.041 --> 00:32:05.543 line:82%
I remember it now, sir.

297
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.253 line:82%
I was returning from a priestly ceremony...

298
00:32:07.294 --> 00:32:11.507 line:82%
when Jangam Ravi, who was drinking
under the banyan tree called me over, sir.

299
00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.272 line:82%
Don't hit me.

300
00:32:33.696 --> 00:32:35.114 line:82%
Please don't hurt me, sir.

301
00:32:37.366 --> 00:32:38.659 line:82%
What have you done?

302
00:32:39.744 --> 00:32:41.954 line:82%
You got her guava when she was young.

303
00:32:42.246 --> 00:32:45.166 line:82%
You raped your sister-in-law
just because she looks fresh like an apple?

304
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:48.836 line:82%
I was not in my senses
when I said it, sir.

305
00:32:48.919 --> 00:32:50.338 line:82%
You were responsible for everything.

306
00:32:51.005 --> 00:32:54.383 line:82%
You are trying to convince people
that Tirupati’s ghost is behind all this.

307
00:32:55.301 --> 00:32:56.552 line:82%
302.

308
00:32:57.345 --> 00:32:59.847 line:82%
Get four pestle stones and
four grinding mortars.

309
00:33:00.056 --> 00:33:01.390 line:82%
Why, sir?

310
00:33:02.475 --> 00:33:05.728 line:82%
To grind you all into a fine chutney.

311
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:07.521 line:82%
[all] Sir!

312
00:33:26.582 --> 00:33:27.875 line:82%
[in Hindi] Don't be afraid.

313
00:33:29.085 --> 00:33:30.795 line:82%
Nothing will happen to your daughter.

314
00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.255 line:82%
She'll be fine.

315
00:33:33.297 --> 00:33:35.341 line:82%
She’s acting like she’s
possessed by a ghost since three days.

316
00:33:35.383 --> 00:33:37.677 line:82%
She’s actually
under a ghost’s possession, Ilaiah.

317
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:41.806 line:82%
But as long as I'm in this village,
not just your daughter...

318
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.725 line:82%
no other girl will be affected.

319
00:33:51.065 --> 00:33:52.858 line:82%
Throw the hen at the village border.

320
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.660 line:82%
-Hello?
-Bro, did you take the Dish TV money?

321
00:34:44.785 --> 00:34:49.040 line:82%
No. These guys are always like this.
They never pay on time.

322
00:34:58.716 --> 00:35:01.719 line:82%
-I'll call you back.
-Alright, brother.

323
00:35:28.996 --> 00:35:30.414 line:82%
What are you saying, Venkatesh?

324
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.541 line:82%
I saw it with my own eyes.

325
00:35:32.875 --> 00:35:35.586 line:82%
Raji Reddy's daughter went
through a terrible thing recently.

326
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.171 line:82%
Why is he saying such things?

327
00:35:37.505 --> 00:35:40.132 line:82%
What's happening in Odela again?

328
00:35:42.093 --> 00:35:43.511 line:82%
My daughter's marriage.

329
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.930 line:82%
I went to your house
to give the wedding invitation.

330
00:35:46.013 --> 00:35:47.515 line:82%
they said you're here. Take it.

331
00:35:47.932 --> 00:35:49.141 line:82%
A marriage at this time?

332
00:35:49.475 --> 00:35:51.769 line:82%
He's the son
of Jammikunta market chairman.

333
00:35:52.186 --> 00:35:53.688 line:82%
The girl is eager to marry.

334
00:35:54.021 --> 00:35:57.024 line:82%
It's not about that.
The situation in the village is not great.

335
00:35:57.274 --> 00:35:59.527 line:82%
The police have no clue
about who killed that girl.

336
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.611 line:82%
And you are talking about marriage?

337
00:36:00.736 --> 00:36:02.321 line:82%
What's there to understand?

338
00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.323 line:82%
The priest has a drinking problem.

339
00:36:04.615 --> 00:36:06.784 line:82%
In his drunken state,
he might have raped and killed her.

340
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:10.413 line:82%
No.
Something fishy is going on.

341
00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:14.542 line:82%
I'm scared that
there might be more deaths.

342
00:36:14.917 --> 00:36:17.253 line:82%
If you’re so scared,
you can skip the wedding.

343
00:36:18.045 --> 00:36:19.964 line:82%
I cannot say no to this alliance.

344
00:36:21.632 --> 00:36:23.300 line:82%
Uncle, please stay close
and take care of all the arrangements.

345
00:36:23.384 --> 00:36:25.136 line:82%
-Okay.
-Alright? See you.

346
00:36:55.583 --> 00:37:00.504 line:82%
You all are sleeping so peacefully?

347
00:37:02.214 --> 00:37:06.844 line:82%
The audacity of you all
to arrange marriages now!

348
00:37:08.387 --> 00:37:13.142 line:82%
The MPTC’s daughter
is getting married, huh?

349
00:37:33.287 --> 00:37:36.332 line:82%
Chandu, why did you
bring this bicycle here?

350
00:37:40.378 --> 00:37:42.963 line:82%
-How do I know?
-You drunkard!

351
00:37:43.047 --> 00:37:48.427 line:82%
I realized you haven't forgotten him
when you wore your brother's clothes.

352
00:37:48.928 --> 00:37:53.057 line:82%
You would have left it here
when you were drunk last night.

353
00:37:53.432 --> 00:37:55.643 line:82%
Do you think I am mad?

354
00:37:55.685 --> 00:37:57.228 line:82%
Aren't you?

355
00:38:00.022 --> 00:38:01.607 line:82%
My dear Tirupati.

356
00:38:01.857 --> 00:38:03.901 line:82%
I'm not sure which world
you've reached after your death.

357
00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:08.739 line:82%
I got mutton curry
from Katika Rajanna.

358
00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:10.533 line:82%
Eat to your full.

359
00:38:11.659 --> 00:38:15.788 line:82%
I got toddy for you from Dhulam Komuraiah.

360
00:38:18.207 --> 00:38:22.086 line:82%
Tirupati, I got
your favorite Ganesh tobacco.

361
00:38:26.173 --> 00:38:27.383 line:82%
That's all. Let's go.

362
00:38:28.259 --> 00:38:29.677 line:82%
How long will you sit here?

363
00:38:30.219 --> 00:38:31.887 line:82%
Are you going to wait till he finishes it?

364
00:38:32.638 --> 00:38:34.307 line:82%
It's almost nightfall, let's leave.

365
00:38:34.473 --> 00:38:35.474 line:82%
My son.

366
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:38.352 line:82%
It has been six months since your demise,

367
00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:42.231 line:82%
but I still feel like you are
right in front of my eyes.

368
00:39:26.984 --> 00:39:27.943 line:82%
-Greetings!
-Greetings!

369
00:39:28.027 --> 00:39:30.321 line:82%
-Why so late?
-I had some work.

370
00:39:30.363 --> 00:39:31.405 line:82%
Alright, come.

371
00:39:39.372 --> 00:39:40.331 line:82%
-What is this, sir?
-I've had enough.

372
00:39:40.373 --> 00:39:41.624 line:82%
-Your plate is empty.
-You please stop.

373
00:39:41.916 --> 00:39:43.918 line:82%
-Sir, please have some.
-Enough.

374
00:39:44.293 --> 00:39:46.462 line:82%
Those who have had food
should come to the presentation area.

375
00:39:46.671 --> 00:39:47.963 line:82%
Come to the announcement.

376
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.840 line:82%
-Brother.
-What’s up, Mayanna?

377
00:39:50.049 --> 00:39:51.717 line:82%
-Greetings.
-Greetings, Mayanna.

378
00:39:51.759 --> 00:39:53.427 line:82%
-Looks like everything is grand.
-Yeah.

379
00:39:53.469 --> 00:39:54.512 line:82%
How many lambs were butchered?

380
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.389 line:82%
People from all four neighboring
villages will attend.

381
00:39:56.764 --> 00:39:58.057 line:82%
At least 20 were butchered.

382
00:39:58.349 --> 00:40:01.310 line:82%
Everyone will talk about it.
Good job!

383
00:40:01.769 --> 00:40:03.020 line:82%
-See you.
-Okay.

384
00:40:03.062 --> 00:40:05.564 line:82%
Let’s give the present,
snap a photo, and wrap it up.

385
00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:08.067 line:82%
-Greetings Mayanna.
-Greetings. All well?

386
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.860 line:82%
-Yes, all good.
-Write down 116 rupees.

387
00:40:11.696 --> 00:40:13.656 line:82%
Why the stare?
Write down 116.

388
00:40:16.867 --> 00:40:18.411 line:82%
What is this 116 rupees?

389
00:40:19.036 --> 00:40:20.454 line:82%
Why are you smiling?

390
00:40:20.538 --> 00:40:23.958 line:82%
You wore a Khadi shirt, but your gift
is 116 rupees. Isn't it funny?

391
00:40:27.211 --> 00:40:28.254 line:82%
What is this?

392
00:40:31.592 --> 00:40:34.678 line:82%
Hey, his party isn't in power.

393
00:40:35.053 --> 00:40:37.514 line:82%
-Perhaps their vault is empty.
-True.

394
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.602 line:82%
If we cut corners during
road construction and lake fixing,

395
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.770 line:82%
not just 20, we can butcher 40!

396
00:40:43.979 --> 00:40:46.773 line:82%
Looks like the Sarpanch is angry.

397
00:40:48.775 --> 00:40:50.861 line:82%
Why fight with our guest?

398
00:40:50.903 --> 00:40:52.613 line:82%
-No, no.
-Write down whatever he gives.

399
00:40:52.905 --> 00:40:54.531 line:82%
Who will start a fight here?

400
00:40:54.865 --> 00:40:56.783 line:82%
How much did you gift
when you came to our wedding?

401
00:40:57.034 --> 00:40:58.076 line:82%
The same 116.

402
00:40:58.202 --> 00:41:00.537 line:82%
We will also gift the same amount.

403
00:41:00.662 --> 00:41:02.206 line:82%
Anyone would do the same.

404
00:41:02.331 --> 00:41:06.335 line:82%
Why announce such a thing
and turn it into a laughing stock?

405
00:41:06.627 --> 00:41:07.753 line:82%
Come on, man.

406
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:09.922 line:82%
You feel bad when announced,
not while writing it down?

407
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.298 line:82%
Here you go.

408
00:41:11.465 --> 00:41:15.552 line:82%
Take this 1000 rupees and write
1116 rupees against Sarpanch’s name.

409
00:41:15.928 --> 00:41:18.639 line:82%
At least his respect will be retained.

410
00:41:18.946 --> 00:41:21.657 line:82%
Hey! Don't forget to write down
his party's name too.

411
00:41:21.991 --> 00:41:22.825 line:82%
Okay, brother.

412
00:41:22.908 --> 00:41:25.745 line:82%
Don't provoke me with party comments
when I'm staying silent!

413
00:41:25.828 --> 00:41:28.372 line:82%
Have I jumped parties
like you every five years?

414
00:41:28.581 --> 00:41:32.334 line:82%
40 years! I have been
in the same party for 40 years.

415
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.753 line:82%
I held the same flag.

416
00:41:33.878 --> 00:41:36.380 line:82%
If you dare comment
on my political party,

417
00:41:36.821 --> 00:41:39.866 line:82%
I will pull your organs out
with my bare hands!

418
00:41:40.658 --> 00:41:43.160 line:82%
You are conducting a pathetic marriage.

419
00:41:43.244 --> 00:41:46.038 line:82%
How dare you!
Don't test my patience!

420
00:41:46.122 --> 00:41:47.957 line:82%
You are a pathetic soul, you idiot.

421
00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.877 line:82%
-How dare you?
-What's wrong with you?

422
00:41:51.043 --> 00:41:53.254 line:82%
-Talk with respect.
-What respect?

423
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.257 line:82%
You dare come to my daughter’s wedding
and call it lousy?

424
00:41:56.465 --> 00:41:59.677 line:82%
Your kid's wedding was lousy!
What are you saying?

425
00:41:59.844 --> 00:42:01.596 line:82%
-That's why Tirupati,
-Take him away!

426
00:42:01.637 --> 00:42:04.682 line:82%
-assaulted and killed your daughter.
-Stop it!

427
00:42:09.437 --> 00:42:11.522 line:82%
How dare you talk about my daughter?

428
00:42:11.564 --> 00:42:14.442 line:82%
-Let me see how you conduct this marriage.
-What did you say?

429
00:42:14.525 --> 00:42:16.694 line:82%
Like you pick a new party
every five years,

430
00:42:16.736 --> 00:42:19.864 line:82%
your daughter will
keep changing the groom.

431
00:42:19.989 --> 00:42:21.866 line:82%
How dare you!

432
00:42:22.116 --> 00:42:23.826 line:82%
You dare go against me, huh?

433
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.163 line:82%
Throw him outside.

434
00:42:27.955 --> 00:42:29.749 line:82%
You invited me to the wedding
and insulted me.

435
00:42:29.874 --> 00:42:31.375 line:82%
This wedding is doomed!

436
00:42:31.792 --> 00:42:34.795 line:82%
Your daughter's life will be
ruined worse than my daughter's.

437
00:42:34.921 --> 00:42:35.838 line:82%
Throw him out.

438
00:42:36.005 --> 00:42:37.506 line:82%
Leave me.

439
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.634 line:82%
Let's decide who is better today!

440
00:42:40.635 --> 00:42:42.637 line:82%
Throw him out!

441
00:42:42.803 --> 00:42:45.389 line:82%
-Only one of us should live today.
-Out!

442
00:43:06.118 --> 00:43:07.453 line:82%
Stop it.

443
00:43:09.038 --> 00:43:11.123 line:82%
-What happened, Mayanna?
-Stop.

444
00:43:11.499 --> 00:43:14.460 line:82%
You want me to control my anger, fine.
But my pee too?

445
00:43:18.756 --> 00:43:20.132 line:82%
Wait while I relieve myself.

446
00:43:29.058 --> 00:43:30.226 line:82%
Mayanna!

447
00:43:30.434 --> 00:43:32.186 line:82%
Go this way. It's all dirty that side.

448
00:43:33.312 --> 00:43:35.231 line:82%
Shut up, you!

449
00:43:45.408 --> 00:43:47.910 line:82%
You Mayya!

450
00:43:50.204 --> 00:43:51.914 line:82%
Come!

451
00:44:04.427 --> 00:44:05.928 line:82%
You Tirupati.

452
00:44:06.846 --> 00:44:11.434 line:82%
When you were alive, you made
the whole village pee from fear.

453
00:44:11.976 --> 00:44:15.438 line:82%
Now, the whole village is peeing on you.

454
00:44:17.565 --> 00:44:21.110 line:82%
I wish you were alive to see this!

455
00:44:22.195 --> 00:44:24.822 line:82%
That MTPC guy's daughter

456
00:44:25.114 --> 00:44:28.242 line:82%
would have experienced
the same fate as mine.

457
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.412 line:82%
Today is her first night.

458
00:44:31.579 --> 00:44:34.248 line:82%
It would have been
her last night as well.

459
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:37.376 line:82%
You Mayya!

460
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.005 line:82%
You came to me
at the right time!

461
00:46:17.935 --> 00:46:19.478 line:82%
Little birdie!

462
00:46:20.354 --> 00:46:23.399 line:82%
This is how you've planned?

463
00:46:23.566 --> 00:46:27.904 line:82%
Maize farm, during the night hour,

464
00:46:27.987 --> 00:46:32.325 line:82%
surrounded by the fence,
with a cot on the ground...

465
00:46:32.742 --> 00:46:35.912 line:82%
How am I going to stop myself?

466
00:46:37.246 --> 00:46:39.290 line:82%
My village, my farmland.

467
00:46:39.415 --> 00:46:41.709 line:82%
The place where I roamed
while holding my mother's hand.

468
00:46:41.792 --> 00:46:43.669 line:82%
The place where I played with my father.

469
00:46:43.878 --> 00:46:47.173 line:82%
The place where I plucked
corn, roasted it, and ate it.

470
00:46:47.298 --> 00:46:48.799 line:82%
I am very happy.

471
00:46:49.008 --> 00:46:52.345 line:82%
Many spend their first night
in the Maldives.

472
00:46:52.678 --> 00:46:54.347 line:82%
Ours is on our island, like this.

473
00:46:54.514 --> 00:46:56.891 line:82%
-Isn't it a lifetime memory?
-Yeah, it is.

474
00:46:57.225 --> 00:47:00.061 line:82%
Full moon above me.
My Vanilla beside me.

475
00:47:00.228 --> 00:47:03.147 line:82%
Then how do I stop?
Let's do it!

476
00:47:04.565 --> 00:47:07.235 line:82%
Let's start with a romantic story.

477
00:47:07.401 --> 00:47:08.569 line:82%
Romantic story?

478
00:47:10.404 --> 00:47:12.573 line:82%
Once upon a time, in a village,

479
00:47:12.698 --> 00:47:15.660 line:82%
there was a milk beauty like you,
and a brown boy like me.

480
00:47:16.911 --> 00:47:18.412 line:82%
Both of them got married.

481
00:47:18.538 --> 00:47:20.706 line:82%
During the first night,
the girl told the boy,

482
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.584 line:82%
"Look at your hand and my body.

483
00:47:24.377 --> 00:47:26.879 line:82%
Look at your beard and my glamour."

484
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.633 line:82%
The whole village knows
what happened after that.

485
00:47:31.259 --> 00:47:34.554 line:82%
I asked for a romantic story, not horror.

486
00:47:35.388 --> 00:47:37.390 line:82%
By the way, what was his name?

487
00:47:37.473 --> 00:47:39.725 line:82%
Tirupati!

488
00:47:56.117 --> 00:47:57.618 line:82%
Hey, who are you?

489
00:47:57.785 --> 00:47:59.954 line:82%
Tirupati!

490
00:48:07.712 --> 00:48:10.256 line:82%
Uncle, why are you saying
you are Tirupati?

491
00:48:12.925 --> 00:48:15.344 line:82%
No, uncle. Don't come closer.

492
00:48:16.262 --> 00:48:18.306 line:82%
It is me, Swetha.

493
00:48:18.514 --> 00:48:20.516 line:82%
Whom are you calling uncle?

494
00:48:25.521 --> 00:48:27.106 line:82%
Uncle, please don't.

495
00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:31.944 line:82%
Tell me the romantic story he told you.

496
00:48:32.111 --> 00:48:34.614 line:82%
Tell me. Tell me.

497
00:48:34.697 --> 00:48:37.366 line:82%
-Don't.
-Tell me!

498
00:49:10.399 --> 00:49:12.818 line:82%
-Oh no!
-Swetha.

499
00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.904 line:82%
Such a tragedy!

500
00:49:19.992 --> 00:49:21.452 line:82%
My dear.

501
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:25.122 line:82%
You were like my mother.

502
00:49:25.623 --> 00:49:28.417 line:82%
-Oh God!
-Oh no!

503
00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.588 line:82%
Swetha!

504
00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.677 line:82%
-What a tragedy!
-My child!

505
00:49:37.885 --> 00:49:39.470 line:82%
My child...

506
00:49:42.557 --> 00:49:45.351 line:82%
My dear, my dear daughter.

507
00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.520 line:82%
My Swetha!

508
00:49:48.145 --> 00:49:50.565 line:82%
-Swetha!
-Go get him.

509
00:49:51.566 --> 00:49:54.402 line:82%
Namah Sivaya

510
00:49:56.571 --> 00:49:59.699 line:82%
Namah Sivaya

511
00:50:00.783 --> 00:50:02.201 line:82%
10,00,000.

512
00:50:02.368 --> 00:50:03.619 line:82%
10 lakhs?

513
00:50:04.245 --> 00:50:07.540 line:82%
Is that the death count
in Odela under Kalakeya?

514
00:50:07.623 --> 00:50:08.583 line:82%
Shiva!

515
00:50:08.958 --> 00:50:11.460 line:82%
Bhairavi's angry phase has begun.

516
00:50:11.669 --> 00:50:13.796 line:82%
Evil is going to become good.

517
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:18.885 line:82%
When Bhairavi completes chanting
Lord Shiva's name 100 crore times.

518
00:50:19.177 --> 00:50:22.763 line:82%
Yes? What is going
to happen in that moment?

519
00:50:22.972 --> 00:50:25.183 line:82%
The wishes of many generations
will come true!

520
00:50:25.516 --> 00:50:27.810 line:82%
The long wait of millenniums
will come to an end.

521
00:50:27.894 --> 00:50:30.730 line:82%
You mean...
a miracle is going to happen?

522
00:50:31.856 --> 00:50:34.525 line:82%
Time is the answer
for everything, Shiva.

523
00:50:35.067 --> 00:50:36.861 line:82%
God is the only eternal truth!

524
00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.739 line:82%
Hey, ACP! What's the update
on that murder case?

525
00:50:39.989 --> 00:50:42.241 line:82%
I'm going there, sir.
I'll sort it out, sir.

526
00:50:42.408 --> 00:50:43.993 line:82%
I'll give you the entire report, sir.

527
00:50:49.248 --> 00:50:51.250 line:82%
How could you kill her like that?

528
00:50:54.837 --> 00:50:57.757 line:82%
Please leave him,
at least you guys tell them.

529
00:50:57.882 --> 00:50:59.550 line:82%
You bloody sarpanch.

530
00:50:59.884 --> 00:51:02.595 line:82%
Sir, please don't.
Tell them not to.

531
00:51:02.637 --> 00:51:04.805 line:82%
It will become a problem
if the higher-ups find out, MPTC.

532
00:51:04.931 --> 00:51:07.141 line:82%
Our department will handle it.
Leave him.

533
00:51:07.266 --> 00:51:08.643 line:82%
What will you handle?

534
00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:10.811 line:82%
There have been many deaths
so far. What have you done?

535
00:51:10.895 --> 00:51:12.104 line:82%
What will you do now?

536
00:51:12.188 --> 00:51:14.232 line:82%
Why do you think we brought
them here and tied them up?

537
00:51:14.315 --> 00:51:15.358 line:82%
To beat them to death!

538
00:51:16.317 --> 00:51:17.693 line:82%
What is this, Mayanna?

539
00:51:18.402 --> 00:51:20.029 line:82%
Though we're not siblings,

540
00:51:20.696 --> 00:51:23.699 line:82%
I called you brother and served
you tea every time you came home.

541
00:51:24.408 --> 00:51:27.495 line:82%
My daughter called you 'Uncle'
and sat on your lap.

542
00:51:27.745 --> 00:51:29.580 line:82%
How could you touch her?

543
00:51:30.081 --> 00:51:32.250 line:82%
You set her on fire!

544
00:51:32.792 --> 00:51:36.462 line:82%
She is nothing but ash now. Oh my God!

545
00:51:38.923 --> 00:51:41.008 line:82%
I am not that kind of a person!

546
00:51:41.342 --> 00:51:44.512 line:82%
No matter how many
political issues we had,

547
00:51:44.679 --> 00:51:47.390 line:82%
why would I do such a heinous thing?

548
00:51:47.723 --> 00:51:50.309 line:82%
She was like a daughter to me!

549
00:51:53.563 --> 00:51:57.358 line:82%
We brought her up
without letting the soil touch her feet.

550
00:51:57.525 --> 00:52:01.070 line:82%
You named her "Yamini",
when she was born.

551
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:02.947 line:82%
Took care of her.

552
00:52:03.072 --> 00:52:07.869 line:82%
You did a ritual for her,
because her horoscope had a flaw.

553
00:52:09.078 --> 00:52:11.747 line:82%
You stayed next to her
and fixed her time of death!

554
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.461 line:82%
No, I did not.

555
00:52:17.503 --> 00:52:20.882 line:82%
I don't know anything.
I didn't do anything.

556
00:52:20.923 --> 00:52:22.675 line:82%
I swear on my wife and kids!

557
00:52:22.884 --> 00:52:24.844 line:82%
I swear on the Odela Mallanna!

558
00:52:24.969 --> 00:52:28.639 line:82%
I got down and went to pee.

559
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:30.349 line:82%
I didn't do anything!

560
00:52:30.474 --> 00:52:33.102 line:82%
I don't know what happened after that.

561
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.438 line:82%
They won't believe you!

562
00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.274 line:82%
No one will believe us!

563
00:52:39.192 --> 00:52:42.945 line:82%
All the villagers just hit us
with stones and kill us instead.

564
00:52:43.279 --> 00:52:46.115 line:82%
Kill us!

565
00:52:46.157 --> 00:52:50.036 line:82%
-They won't kill us. They won't!
-Kill us!

566
00:52:50.161 --> 00:52:52.079 line:82%
We have to die on our own.

567
00:52:59.629 --> 00:53:01.172 line:82%
Priest! Priest!

568
00:53:01.214 --> 00:53:02.506 line:82%
Hey! Check him.

569
00:53:02.673 --> 00:53:05.009 line:82%
-Hey, Priest! Priest!
-Priest, stand up.

570
00:53:05.218 --> 00:53:09.847 line:82%
Don't. Don't.

571
00:53:10.223 --> 00:53:12.558 line:82%
-Remove your hand.
-Stop it.

572
00:53:13.059 --> 00:53:13.976 line:82%
Stop it.

573
00:53:17.772 --> 00:53:19.398 line:82%
You don't have to die!

574
00:53:21.067 --> 00:53:22.401 line:82%
You didn't kill anyone!

575
00:53:25.279 --> 00:53:26.280 line:82%
Then who killed her?

576
00:53:26.447 --> 00:53:27.949 line:82%
The mistake made by this village!

577
00:53:29.909 --> 00:53:31.077 line:82%
Tell us clearly.

578
00:53:31.827 --> 00:53:34.914 line:82%
Venkatesh, play
the CCTV footage on the TV.

579
00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.379 line:82%
Pittala Aylaiah's daughter was possessed.

580
00:53:42.338 --> 00:53:43.839 line:82%
Do you know what this
dish Venkatesh saw

581
00:53:43.881 --> 00:53:46.676 line:82%
that night, when they were
returning from offering a sacrifice?

582
00:53:56.727 --> 00:53:58.813 line:82%
Who ate that black hen?

583
00:54:02.775 --> 00:54:07.071 line:82%
Why is the cycle that should be inside
the house roaming around the village?

584
00:54:11.576 --> 00:54:15.121 line:82%
Those who used to deliver milk to the Milk
Association early in the morning,

585
00:54:15.329 --> 00:54:18.749 line:82%
why did they stop going, claiming
they heard noises from the graveyard?

586
00:54:21.544 --> 00:54:23.087 line:82%
What are you saying, Allah Bakhsh?

587
00:54:23.838 --> 00:54:24.797 line:82%
Do you mean...

588
00:54:24.964 --> 00:54:26.716 line:82%
Yes, what you are thinking is correct.

589
00:54:27.592 --> 00:54:31.012 line:82%
Tirupati is dead
but his soul is still alive!

590
00:54:40.938 --> 00:54:43.983 line:82%
You punished yourself
by giving him the burial punishment.

591
00:54:45.318 --> 00:54:49.238 line:82%
He is possessing them
to fulfill his unfulfilled desires!

592
00:54:59.832 --> 00:55:02.084 line:82%
-Sir.
-Lock him up.

593
00:55:03.294 --> 00:55:04.378 line:82%
What are you saying, sir?

594
00:55:04.837 --> 00:55:06.714 line:82%
He's Allah Bakhsh!

595
00:55:07.131 --> 00:55:08.716 line:82%
He is this village's protector.

596
00:55:08.799 --> 00:55:09.634 line:82%
Yes, sir.

597
00:55:09.967 --> 00:55:11.385 line:82%
He's the only one who protects us

598
00:55:11.636 --> 00:55:14.805 line:82%
from the wandering souls,
the spirits and ghosts!

599
00:55:14.972 --> 00:55:18.017 line:82%
-He protects the village and all of us!
-Shut up!

600
00:55:19.435 --> 00:55:21.312 line:82%
We are in 2025.

601
00:55:22.063 --> 00:55:23.940 line:82%
Why do you believe in ghosts?

602
00:55:25.733 --> 00:55:29.070 line:82%
You're using Tirupati
as an excuse to escape punishment!

603
00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.448 line:82%
They should be
in the lock-up. Why are they here?

604
00:55:33.574 --> 00:55:38.037 line:82%
The entire village will be imprisoned
if you take the law into your own hands!

605
00:55:38.162 --> 00:55:40.039 line:82%
I have been seeing them
since my childhood, sir.

606
00:55:40.665 --> 00:55:42.625 line:82%
Our priest only knows to chant mantras,

607
00:55:43.501 --> 00:55:44.961 line:82%
not to commit murders.

608
00:55:46.128 --> 00:55:48.422 line:82%
Mayanna may be into politics,

609
00:55:49.298 --> 00:55:51.342 line:82%
but how can we believe
that he raped someone?

610
00:55:52.301 --> 00:55:53.261 line:82%
What?

611
00:55:53.803 --> 00:55:55.847 line:82%
Are you trying to rescue them?

612
00:55:56.097 --> 00:55:57.765 line:82%
I'm trying to protect the village.

613
00:55:58.224 --> 00:56:01.352 line:82%
You are trying to convince us
with ghost stories?

614
00:56:01.435 --> 00:56:02.562 line:82%
You must believe, sir!

615
00:56:03.646 --> 00:56:05.565 line:82%
Because belief is of two kinds.

616
00:56:06.232 --> 00:56:08.234 line:82%
A believer believes in the temple,

617
00:56:09.068 --> 00:56:10.736 line:82%
and a non-believer trusts superstition!

618
00:56:11.112 --> 00:56:14.657 line:82%
The same people who believe that
light is God, are afraid of the darkness.

619
00:56:14.949 --> 00:56:18.870 line:82%
A heart filled with courage
can still hold cowardice.

620
00:56:19.036 --> 00:56:21.998 line:82%
Encountering a cat is considered
inauspicious, but a cow is auspicious.

621
00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:23.416 line:82%
Both are animals, sir!

622
00:56:23.624 --> 00:56:26.127 line:82%
If you take a breath, it is life.
If you stop breathing, it is death.

623
00:56:26.252 --> 00:56:27.670 line:82%
It's the same air!

624
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.298 line:82%
If it hits you, you go crazy.

625
00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:33.759 line:82%
That is called a spirit.

626
00:56:34.635 --> 00:56:35.887 line:82%
An evil spirit.

627
00:56:37.096 --> 00:56:39.307 line:82%
In this village,
it’s also called Tirupati!

628
00:56:39.473 --> 00:56:41.225 line:82%
Stop your empty words.

629
00:56:42.059 --> 00:56:43.519 line:82%
What evil spirit!

630
00:56:44.562 --> 00:56:47.815 line:82%
I will prove there are
no such things as ghosts or evil spirits!

631
00:56:48.691 --> 00:56:51.986 line:82%
You don't have to come
to the station to report a crime.

632
00:56:53.112 --> 00:56:57.783 line:82%
I will set up a tent
and sit near Tirupati's grave.

633
00:56:59.285 --> 00:57:01.037 line:82%
I will prove to you all

634
00:57:01.245 --> 00:57:06.042 line:82%
that the blame on Tirupati
is a plan they made to protect these guys.

635
00:57:50.628 --> 00:57:53.297 line:82%
All of you can leave now.
Come back in the morning.

636
00:57:53.548 --> 00:57:55.716 line:82%
I don't need security here. Go.

637
00:57:55.925 --> 00:57:58.094 line:82%
It's not safe, sir. Please.

638
00:57:58.511 --> 00:58:00.972 line:82%
-Think again.
-I don't need security.

639
00:58:01.222 --> 00:58:03.349 line:82%
Okay, sir. Send everyone away.

640
00:58:03.891 --> 00:58:05.309 line:82%
-Hey, 302!
-Sir?

641
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:06.894 line:82%
While coming in the morning,

642
00:58:07.478 --> 00:58:09.814 line:82%
-get some good tea.
-[both] Okay, sir.

643
00:58:09.939 --> 00:58:11.858 line:82%
-Okay, sir.
-We'll see you tomorrow.

644
00:58:12.525 --> 00:58:16.946 line:82%
[singing] Come on, darling!
Let's see what you got!

645
00:58:40.011 --> 00:58:41.012 line:82%
Sir?

646
00:58:41.804 --> 00:58:43.222 line:82%
I brought your tea.

647
00:58:44.348 --> 00:58:45.349 line:82%
Sir?

648
00:58:46.225 --> 00:58:47.101 line:82%
Sir!

649
00:58:49.145 --> 00:58:50.188 line:82%
Sir.

650
00:58:56.235 --> 00:58:57.195 line:82%
Sir!

651
00:59:18.716 --> 00:59:19.967 line:82%
Spirit, huh?

652
00:59:20.718 --> 00:59:22.386 line:82%
What bullshit!

653
01:00:12.937 --> 01:00:15.273 line:82%
That Tirupati killed the ACP.

654
01:00:16.232 --> 01:00:18.901 line:82%
Allah Baksh brother,
that Tirupati killed the ACP.

655
01:01:06.782 --> 01:01:08.701 line:82%
Mom, where did he go?

656
01:01:21.797 --> 01:01:24.634 line:82%
Radha, your village people
have come to meet you.

657
01:01:38.314 --> 01:01:42.068 line:82%
I have taken special permission
to allow you all to meet. Make it quick.

658
01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:43.653 line:82%
How are you, Radha?

659
01:01:45.821 --> 01:01:46.948 line:82%
I'm okay, brother.

660
01:01:48.824 --> 01:01:50.034 line:82%
How is the village, brother?

661
01:01:52.995 --> 01:01:54.497 line:82%
Burial punishment.

662
01:02:03.965 --> 01:02:07.093 line:82%
Oh my God!

663
01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.719 line:82%
What have you done, brother?

664
01:02:08.886 --> 01:02:10.680 line:82%
Why the burial punishment, brother?

665
01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:13.474 line:82%
Is this why I became a widow?

666
01:02:14.934 --> 01:02:19.605 line:82%
I killed him to punish him.
But you punished and kept him alive!

667
01:02:21.148 --> 01:02:22.483 line:82%
We made a mistake, Radha.

668
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:26.404 line:82%
You must tell us if you
have any idea of how to escape him.

669
01:02:28.406 --> 01:02:30.241 line:82%
It was you who saved us then.

670
01:02:30.741 --> 01:02:33.286 line:82%
Only you can save us now!

671
01:02:34.412 --> 01:02:37.874 line:82%
Only Bhairavi can save you now!

672
01:02:47.008 --> 01:02:48.301 line:82%
Your sister Bhairavi?

673
01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:51.846 line:82%
-When she was a child...
-She ran away from home.

674
01:02:52.013 --> 01:02:53.055 line:82%
The whole village knows that.

675
01:02:53.806 --> 01:02:57.185 line:82%
But the reason she ran away
is known only to my family.

676
01:02:58.144 --> 01:03:00.563 line:82%
My sister Bhairavi likes Bapamma.

677
01:03:01.272 --> 01:03:03.482 line:82%
Bapamma likes Lord Shiva.

678
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.151 line:82%
She also liked the discourse

679
01:03:05.193 --> 01:03:08.946 line:82%
about Shiva's powers given
by the saint from Ramagiri Fort.

680
01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:14.160 line:82%
The mistake you made is getting stuck
in the bonds of the family.

681
01:03:14.952 --> 01:03:18.414 line:82%
A girl gets her first period
at the age of 12.

682
01:03:19.081 --> 01:03:24.170 line:82%
Later, her periods stop
at the age of 55 to 58.

683
01:03:24.337 --> 01:03:27.882 line:82%
Whichever girl preserves her virginity

684
01:03:28.216 --> 01:03:32.220 line:82%
from her first period till its end,

685
01:03:32.678 --> 01:03:34.847 line:82%
and follows celibacy
and stays away from married life,

686
01:03:35.389 --> 01:03:40.603 line:82%
and chants
Shiva Panchakshari mantra 110 crore times

687
01:03:40.853 --> 01:03:43.898 line:82%
that girl will be graced by
Lord Shiva's appearance!

688
01:03:47.193 --> 01:03:50.404 line:82%
We realized how deeply
those words of the saint affected her,

689
01:03:50.446 --> 01:03:53.741 line:82%
only after she turned 18.

690
01:03:53.991 --> 01:03:55.117 line:82%
I don't like it.

691
01:03:55.368 --> 01:03:56.994 line:82%
I don't like marriage.

692
01:03:57.203 --> 01:03:59.038 line:82%
I want to follow Bapamma's path.

693
01:03:59.163 --> 01:04:01.249 line:82%
I am going in search of Lord Shiva.

694
01:04:01.415 --> 01:04:03.376 line:82%
Don't come in search of me.

695
01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:06.045 line:82%
I don't want the trouble
of marriage and children.

696
01:04:06.212 --> 01:04:07.922 line:82%
I want to be one with the Supreme.

697
01:04:08.256 --> 01:04:09.549 line:82%
Assume that I am dead.

698
01:04:09.757 --> 01:04:11.342 line:82%
I won't come back even if I die.

699
01:04:24.313 --> 01:04:26.482 line:82%
A few days after we learned that,

700
01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:28.985 line:82%
we lost our parents.

701
01:04:29.193 --> 01:04:32.738 line:82%
After that, her language
and attire changed completely.

702
01:04:51.757 --> 01:04:54.177 line:82%
The name, Bhavani, changed to Bhairavi.

703
01:04:54.552 --> 01:04:56.679 line:82%
Shiva Satti became Shiva Shakti.

704
01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:01.601 line:82%
In the Himalayan snow mountains,

705
01:05:01.684 --> 01:05:05.271 line:82%
many saints became her disciples
because of her sincere devotion.

706
01:05:07.982 --> 01:05:09.400 line:82%
Barefoot.

707
01:05:15.239 --> 01:05:16.699 line:82%
It won't touch the ground.

708
01:05:18.618 --> 01:05:20.369 line:82%
Infallible body.

709
01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.415 line:82%
A mind cleansed by fire.

710
01:05:27.501 --> 01:05:30.171 line:82%
Her breath became one
with her Shiva prayer.

711
01:05:30.296 --> 01:05:33.341 line:82%
She joined the Kashi Agoras
and became a Naga Sadhu.

712
01:05:33.758 --> 01:05:36.427 line:82%
She spends her time near the
Jyotirlingas...
is what we heard.

713
01:05:45.353 --> 01:05:46.395 line:82%
Now...

714
01:05:46.604 --> 01:05:48.272 line:82%
How do we meet her?

715
01:05:58.748 --> 01:06:02.251 line:82%
There's a ruined Shiva temple
in the foothills of Ramagiri Fort.

716
01:06:02.585 --> 01:06:04.587 line:82%
That used to be
our Bapamma's favorite temple.

717
01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:09.842 line:82%
I heard my sister visits there every year
in time for Bapamma's death anniversary.

718
01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:13.262 line:82%
My sister is our only refuge now.

719
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:26.359 line:82%
[Sanskrit shloka]

720
01:06:48.506 --> 01:06:49.382 line:82%
Brother.

721
01:06:49.716 --> 01:06:52.468 line:82%
Have you seen a Naga sadhu
named Bhairavi around here?

722
01:06:52.593 --> 01:06:54.303 line:82%
-No, brother.
-[all] Yay!

723
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:55.972 line:82%
Where are they taking the cows?

724
01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:59.559 line:82%
Go, go, go! Run faster!

725
01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:03.813 line:82%
Hey, look at that.

726
01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.899 line:82%
-Look at that!
-Come, come, come.

727
01:07:07.025 --> 01:07:09.193 line:82%
Hey, faster, man.
Driver faster.

728
01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:10.570 line:82%
It's running very nicely.

729
01:07:10.737 --> 01:07:12.238 line:82%
Look, look at how
your calf is running.

730
01:07:12.363 --> 01:07:13.948 line:82%
The calf comes rolling through the dust.

731
01:07:14.157 --> 01:07:17.410 line:82%
Not just humans, even cows
seem to have a heart.

732
01:07:17.702 --> 01:07:19.912 line:82%
Are you saying it like that?

733
01:07:20.496 --> 01:07:22.123 line:82%
If that's the case,
then let's test it.

734
01:07:22.415 --> 01:07:23.624 line:82%
How big is the heart?

735
01:07:23.666 --> 01:07:26.711 line:82%
-How much love it has?
-Let's see. Come!

736
01:07:26.794 --> 01:07:28.254 line:82%
It's not even ten days since its birth.

737
01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:30.256 line:82%
-Come, come.
-Why is it coming with such a force?

738
01:07:30.423 --> 01:07:32.050 line:82%
-Come.
-Hey, drive faster.

739
01:07:32.341 --> 01:07:34.844 line:82%
-[All] Look, look.
-See your baby.

740
01:07:34.927 --> 01:07:36.596 line:82%
-Run, run, run.
-See how it's running.

741
01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:38.431 line:82%
-[All] Look.
-Have you seen how your baby is?

742
01:07:38.723 --> 01:07:41.017 line:82%
Come, come! Come running.

743
01:07:41.142 --> 01:07:42.477 line:82%
Come, come running.

744
01:07:42.602 --> 01:07:44.729 line:82%
-Look.
-Come on. Come.

745
01:07:45.021 --> 01:07:46.564 line:82%
-Tired already?
-Keep running.

746
01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:48.900 line:82%
Run. Run.
Look, your calf is unable to run.

747
01:08:16.177 --> 01:08:17.887 line:82%
-Hold tight, hold.
-Tie it.

748
01:08:18.012 --> 01:08:19.514 line:82%
Stop.

749
01:08:19.722 --> 01:08:22.850 line:82%
What are these guys doing?
Why aren't you stopping them?

750
01:08:23.059 --> 01:08:23.976 line:82%
Hit it.

751
01:08:24.435 --> 01:08:26.270 line:82%
Why are these mad fellows
beating a cow to a pulp?

752
01:08:30.566 --> 01:08:32.819 line:82%
Are you going to kill it?

753
01:08:33.486 --> 01:08:35.613 line:82%
How can we not kill it?

754
01:08:39.242 --> 01:08:40.743 line:82%
Oh my Lord Shiva!

755
01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:30.877 line:82%
Hey! Who are you?

756
01:09:30.918 --> 01:09:34.005 line:82%
We will get to know each other later.

757
01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:39.552 line:82%
First, drop the cow
from where you stole her.

758
01:09:39.886 --> 01:09:41.429 line:82%
Killing a cow is a sin.

759
01:09:42.096 --> 01:09:43.222 line:82%
You!

760
01:09:43.473 --> 01:09:46.809 line:82%
Just because you dress like Shiva Sakthi,
will not make you God Shiva!

761
01:09:46.976 --> 01:09:50.146 line:82%
Now, let's see who is going
to say that killing you is a sin.

762
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:51.481 line:82%
You will die.

763
01:09:52.357 --> 01:09:54.984 line:82%
I will spare you...
if you spare the cow.

764
01:09:55.109 --> 01:09:58.196 line:82%
I will spare them, not you!

765
01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:12.627 line:82%
You need Goddess Bhumatha to stand on...

766
01:10:13.544 --> 01:10:15.421 line:82%
and Goddess Goumatha to live.

767
01:10:15.671 --> 01:10:18.049 line:82%
You don't have to kill them for a living.

768
01:10:18.174 --> 01:10:20.259 line:82%
You can make a living
by selling her urine.

769
01:10:20.343 --> 01:10:22.929 line:82%
Are you asking us to sell urine?
How dare you!

770
01:10:41.239 --> 01:10:43.616 line:82%
Mahadeva.

771
01:11:49.432 --> 01:11:53.311 line:82%
If you dare lay your hands on any cow,

772
01:11:53.686 --> 01:11:55.772 line:82%
or your knives touch any neck,

773
01:11:56.105 --> 01:11:57.815 line:82%
your heads will roll!

774
01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:08.368 line:82%
Hey! Hey!

775
01:12:09.827 --> 01:12:11.579 line:82%
Bhairavi, dear!

776
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:19.087 line:82%
100,000.

777
01:12:50.125 --> 01:12:53.128 line:82%
We've been pleading for the past
24 hours. Won't you show mercy?

778
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:57.466 line:82%
There's no use even if you
stand here for 24 days.

779
01:12:57.633 --> 01:13:01.303 line:82%
There are no crops
or festivals in the village.

780
01:13:01.887 --> 01:13:04.848 line:82%
There is no sign of happiness
on anyone's face.

781
01:13:05.557 --> 01:13:09.520 line:82%
Please think about our village!

782
01:13:10.396 --> 01:13:13.899 line:82%
Lord Vishwanatha is mine.
This universe is my village.

783
01:13:14.066 --> 01:13:15.693 line:82%
Your sister is in jail.

784
01:13:16.151 --> 01:13:17.611 line:82%
Your family is on the streets.

785
01:13:18.112 --> 01:13:21.782 line:82%
Life and death, and happiness and sorrow
are the fruits of your actions.

786
01:13:21.907 --> 01:13:23.158 line:82%
You must bear it.

787
01:13:24.118 --> 01:13:27.538 line:82%
The punishment you gave
has turned into your own punishment.

788
01:13:27.663 --> 01:13:30.374 line:82%
In Odela, we share all
our troubles with Lord Mallanna.

789
01:13:30.874 --> 01:13:32.835 line:82%
But his temple doesn't have a priest now.

790
01:13:33.544 --> 01:13:35.129 line:82%
The Lord has become voiceless.

791
01:13:41.719 --> 01:13:43.053 line:82%
[both] We made a mistake.

792
01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.930 line:82%
While you all enjoyed
three meals a day,

793
01:13:44.972 --> 01:13:47.641 line:82%
you didn't remember
to worship the Lord even once a day!

794
01:13:47.725 --> 01:13:52.146 line:82%
The Lord must show us the way
when we devotees make mistakes, right?

795
01:13:52.771 --> 01:13:58.527 line:82%
This town needs to be rescued
either by Lord Bhairava or you, Bhairavi.

796
01:14:42.237 --> 01:14:47.409 line:82%
♪ O Mother! Goddess Nagamma!
Please save us! ♪

797
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.950 line:82%
Bhairavi.

798
01:15:31.286 --> 01:15:33.163 line:82%
I think she's forgotten us.

799
01:16:45.486 --> 01:16:48.030 line:82%
The Lingam fell from my hands...

800
01:16:48.822 --> 01:16:54.036 line:82%
it means that it's time for me
to unite with Lord Shiva.

801
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.751 line:82%
Om Namah Shivaya.

802
01:17:04.254 --> 01:17:05.464 line:82%
Bapamma!

803
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.217 line:82%
Bapamma!

804
01:17:09.176 --> 01:17:10.928 line:82%
Bapamma! Please wake up.

805
01:17:11.303 --> 01:17:12.680 line:82%
Bapamma! Wake up.

806
01:17:12.846 --> 01:17:14.014 line:82%
Bapamma!

807
01:17:39.415 --> 01:17:41.000 line:82%
The people trusted me.

808
01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.171 line:82%
Please bless their faith, Bapamma!

809
01:20:16.447 --> 01:20:17.614 line:82%
Don't come!

810
01:20:18.157 --> 01:20:19.700 line:82%
Don't come near me!

811
01:20:26.373 --> 01:20:27.458 line:82%
Hey! No!

812
01:20:29.335 --> 01:20:31.170 line:82%
No! Don't come!

813
01:20:31.295 --> 01:20:35.758 line:82%
The only thing that stops
a turbulent soul is restraint.

814
01:20:38.594 --> 01:20:39.887 line:82%
Chandrika.

815
01:20:40.095 --> 01:20:41.180 line:82%
Mother!

816
01:20:41.722 --> 01:20:42.681 line:82%
The trident.

817
01:20:46.602 --> 01:20:48.562 line:82%
Hey! Leave!

818
01:20:48.771 --> 01:20:49.897 line:82%
LEAVE!

819
01:20:52.066 --> 01:20:53.192 line:82%
Hey!

820
01:21:00.407 --> 01:21:02.451 line:82%
Don’t come! No! No!

821
01:21:03.494 --> 01:21:04.328 line:82%
Hey!

822
01:21:06.413 --> 01:21:07.790 line:82%
No! Hey!

823
01:21:08.332 --> 01:21:09.500 line:82%
Leave!

824
01:21:11.627 --> 01:21:12.753 line:82%
HEY!

825
01:21:12.961 --> 01:21:16.965 line:82%
Through
Tantric mantra
ritual.

826
01:21:31.814 --> 01:21:34.983 line:82%
Hey! No!

827
01:21:35.275 --> 01:21:37.236 line:82%
Leave!

828
01:22:05.931 --> 01:22:10.894 line:82%
To bind the soul for a fortnight,
you must gather a few things.

829
01:22:11.103 --> 01:22:12.855 line:82%
Please let us know what you need, mother!

830
01:22:13.188 --> 01:22:17.151 line:82%
I need four Nandis which have been
worshipped in Lord Jangamaiah's temple.

831
01:22:17.484 --> 01:22:19.319 line:82%
Shiva is the lord of the graveyard.

832
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:25.159 line:82%
According to
Shiva Purana,
Lord of demons
has 18
Sivaganas,

833
01:22:25.909 --> 01:22:30.039 line:82%
such as
bootha, pretha,
yakshini, daakini, gandharva
and so on.

834
01:22:31.373 --> 01:22:34.960 line:82%
After Ganapati, Nandeeshwara
is the chief of all those
Ganas.

835
01:22:37.463 --> 01:22:38.922 line:82%
Not just the Gods,

836
01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:42.718 line:82%
but even the souls need His permission.

837
01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.764 line:82%
I need nine grains
that have not changed hands.

838
01:22:46.889 --> 01:22:50.517 line:82%
Planetary favor is as important
to souls as it is to human beings.

839
01:22:51.727 --> 01:22:54.730 line:82%
These nine grains symbolize
those nine planets.

840
01:22:56.982 --> 01:23:01.403 line:82%
The purpose of binding these
nine grains is to weaken that strength.

841
01:23:05.491 --> 01:23:07.701 line:82%
I also need flowing water
of the river Ganga.

842
01:23:12.665 --> 01:23:16.502 line:82%
In Hinduism, it is believed that bathing
in the river Ganga washes away sins,

843
01:23:16.752 --> 01:23:19.755 line:82%
and mixing ashes in it
brings peace to the souls.

844
01:23:20.089 --> 01:23:21.924 line:82%
That's why we need Ganga water.

845
01:23:26.428 --> 01:23:27.346 line:82%
Goda.

846
01:23:32.393 --> 01:23:37.731 line:82%
We'll bind using the matted hair
and nerves of the Naga sadhus

847
01:23:37.856 --> 01:23:42.903 line:82%
who spent hundreds of years
in Tantric education using skulls.

848
01:23:45.864 --> 01:23:48.450 line:82%
The spirit's movements are blocked.

849
01:23:49.368 --> 01:23:51.787 line:82%
Today is the new moon
of the
Margashira
month.

850
01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:56.208 line:82%
Shukla Paksha
begins tomorrow.

851
01:23:57.292 --> 01:24:02.047 line:82%
Tirupati's evil spirit will weaken
before the end of this
Shukla Paksha.

852
01:24:03.674 --> 01:24:08.554 line:82%
Until then, these four Nandis will
protect the four sides of your village.

853
01:24:09.054 --> 01:24:12.933 line:82%
If these Nandis move, or if
the nine grains lose their freshness,

854
01:24:13.017 --> 01:24:15.102 line:82%
or even if the shadow
of a human being falls on this,

855
01:24:15.853 --> 01:24:19.690 line:82%
it'll be impossible even for God
to stop the evil spirit's havoc.

856
01:24:22.026 --> 01:24:23.652 line:82%
During these 15 days,

857
01:24:23.736 --> 01:24:28.157 line:82%
one person from each family
must take turns to guard the grave.

858
01:24:28.949 --> 01:24:32.453 line:82%
Even birds or animals
shouldn't cross the line.

859
01:24:32.745 --> 01:24:38.417 line:82%
After that, if we exhume
the corpse and burn it,

860
01:24:39.251 --> 01:24:41.170 line:82%
Kapalamoksha is attained.

861
01:24:42.004 --> 01:24:44.089 line:82%
Shivoham.

862
01:24:46.508 --> 01:24:47.426 line:82%
Mother!

863
01:24:48.052 --> 01:24:50.220 line:82%
Please stay with us for these 15 days.

864
01:24:50.888 --> 01:24:54.933 line:82%
Please leave only after
the Kapalamoksha, Mother.

865
01:24:55.809 --> 01:24:56.935 line:82%
Okay.

866
01:24:57.061 --> 01:24:59.271 line:82%
Make living arrangements
for me in the Mallanna temple.

867
01:24:59.688 --> 01:25:00.773 line:82%
Okay, Mother!

868
01:25:05.402 --> 01:25:07.821 line:82%
♪ Parameshwara has descended

869

What is happening in Odela?

873
01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:46.402 line:82%
Surrounding places like Vavilala,
Gumpula, Indurthi, Pothkapalli, Gudem,

874
01:25:46.527 --> 01:25:50.989 line:82%
everyone in Kalvasrirampur Mandal
has only confusion.

875
01:25:51.156 --> 01:25:54.952 line:82%
What’s been happening
in Odela over the past few days?

876
01:25:54.993 --> 01:25:58.122 line:82%
None of the villagers
have been leaving lately,

877
01:25:58.414 --> 01:26:01.125 line:82%
and no outsiders are coming in.

878
01:26:01.166 --> 01:26:05.087 line:82%
Why was Tirupati punished
with burial punishment?

879
01:26:05.212 --> 01:26:06.171 line:82%
Hey! Hey!

880
01:26:06.296 --> 01:26:08.799 line:82%
It's going close to the tree. Watch out!

881
01:26:09.049 --> 01:26:10.467 line:82%
Oh my!

882
01:26:10.884 --> 01:26:12.052 line:82%
Oh no! It fell, dude!

883
01:26:12.594 --> 01:26:14.513 line:82%
The drone is worth four lakhs, dude!

884
01:26:14.596 --> 01:26:16.015 line:82%
Keep running.

885
01:26:16.098 --> 01:26:17.891 line:82%
-It's a drone, dude!
-Wait, wait!

886
01:26:18.559 --> 01:26:20.477 line:82%
Brother. It's me.
Didn't you recognize me?

887
01:26:20.561 --> 01:26:24.148 line:82%
Oh! You're Satyam from City Channel,
Kalvasrirampur. What's the matter?

888
01:26:24.273 --> 01:26:27.860 line:82%
My drone fell into the grave while
shooting a video in the outskirts.

889
01:26:27.985 --> 01:26:28.944 line:82%
I came to recover it.

890
01:26:29.153 --> 01:26:31.155 line:82%
You guys aren't aware
of what's happening in this village.

891
01:26:31.405 --> 01:26:34.450 line:82%
If you cross that line,
our village won't exist next to yours.

892
01:26:34.658 --> 01:26:36.285 line:82%
You don't get it, dude.
The drone is worth four lakhs.

893
01:26:36.535 --> 01:26:38.620 line:82%
The lives of four people
are worth more than four lakhs.

894
01:26:38.829 --> 01:26:40.164 line:82%
-Get lost!
-You're not understanding.

895
01:26:40.622 --> 01:26:42.082 line:82%
We'll pick it up in a jiffy.

896
01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:44.835 line:82%
Will you leave, or should I call
the villagers and the police?

897
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.838 line:82%
Please don't be angry, bro.
We're leaving.

898
01:26:48.005 --> 01:26:48.922 line:82%
Keep moving, then.

899
01:26:49.048 --> 01:26:50.799 line:82%
Why are you staring at me?

900
01:26:50.924 --> 01:26:52.134 line:82%
-Keep moving from here.
-Yeah! We're leaving.

901
01:26:52.843 --> 01:26:53.761 line:82%
Brother!

902
01:28:17.469 --> 01:28:19.596 line:82%
30, 000

903
01:28:32.192 --> 01:28:34.653 line:82%
How did I leave
someone like her till now!

904
01:28:34.862 --> 01:28:38.907 line:82%
I’ve been after
sour tamarinds this whole time.

905
01:28:39.742 --> 01:28:43.412 line:82%
How gorgeous you are
in those wet clothes.

906
01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.642 line:82%
Come, come, come!

907
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:49.436 line:82%
Come! Come, damn you!

908
01:29:50.062 --> 01:29:51.730 line:82%
Come, come, come!

909
01:29:53.816 --> 01:29:55.150 line:82%
Hey! Come!

910
01:29:56.443 --> 01:29:57.486 line:82%
Come!

911
01:30:05.869 --> 01:30:07.788 line:82%
Where is she?

912
01:30:45.951 --> 01:30:47.661 line:82%
What the hell?

913
01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:50.956 line:82%
Do you think you
can protect this village?

914
01:31:00.382 --> 01:31:01.800 line:82%
Oh!

915
01:31:02.217 --> 01:31:04.928 line:82%
Nagu, Naga sadhu!

916
01:31:05.262 --> 01:31:07.181 line:82%
Is this all your doing?

917
01:31:07.556 --> 01:31:10.517 line:82%
What's your nuisance in my Odela?

918
01:31:11.477 --> 01:31:14.688 line:82%
Even the village leaders
turned a blind eye to everything!

919
01:31:15.022 --> 01:31:16.940 line:82%
What can you do?

920
01:31:17.775 --> 01:31:19.068 line:82%
Rudra!

921
01:31:20.402 --> 01:31:22.363 line:82%
May all bad omens be averted.

922
01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:26.116 line:82%
If you wrongly utter one more word,

923
01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.285 line:82%
I'll rip you apart.

924
01:31:28.744 --> 01:31:30.079 line:82%
Beware!

925
01:31:30.537 --> 01:31:32.373 line:82%
I'm the daughter of this Odela.

926
01:31:32.831 --> 01:31:33.874 line:82%
Remember that!

927
01:31:34.041 --> 01:31:35.334 line:82%
What?

928
01:31:35.751 --> 01:31:37.252 line:82%
You think you're strong?

929
01:31:37.753 --> 01:31:40.464 line:82%
A dog guarding
a pile of dead bodies!

930
01:31:40.547 --> 01:31:43.634 line:82%
A beggar who holds a begging bowl.

931
01:31:43.759 --> 01:31:47.471 line:82%
Having snakes and skulls around the neck,
covering the body with ash,

932
01:31:47.513 --> 01:31:51.100 line:82%
roaming villages and graveyards
without proper clothes.

933
01:31:51.183 --> 01:31:52.559 line:82%
He's a God?

934
01:31:52.601 --> 01:31:54.978 line:82%
And you are
his devotee, Shiva Shakti, huh?

935
01:31:55.145 --> 01:31:56.438 line:82%
Silence!

936
01:31:56.689 --> 01:32:00.943 line:82%
The one-letter form of
Parabrahma,
the one who has a serpent ornament,

937
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:03.237 line:82%
he's the one who
can crush demons' ego,

938
01:32:03.362 --> 01:32:06.115 line:82%
the savior of the innocent,
destroyer of the wicked!

939
01:32:06.198 --> 01:32:07.616 line:82%
Get lost!

940
01:32:09.118 --> 01:32:13.247 line:82%
You're a fragile woman
who can't live without a man.

941
01:32:13.414 --> 01:32:15.082 line:82%
What can you really do?

942
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:18.544 line:82%
Ayodhya, Mathura, Maya,
Kasi, Kanchi, Avanthika!

943
01:32:18.711 --> 01:32:22.881 line:82%
Don't challenge the one who did penance
in those seven holy places, you devil!

944
01:32:26.468 --> 01:32:28.512 line:82%
Are you ready to fight the devil?

945
01:32:29.763 --> 01:32:33.851 line:82%
I'll show the real meaning
of havoc to this village!

946
01:32:37.187 --> 01:32:39.314 line:82%
I'll do penance to please the devil.

947
01:32:39.857 --> 01:32:44.319 line:82%
Not just living beings,
I will embrace all five elements!

948
01:32:45.112 --> 01:32:48.532 line:82%
I'll destroy the earth and bring famine.

949
01:32:51.869 --> 01:32:53.954 line:82%
I'll feed them like Goddess Shatakshi.

950
01:32:54.079 --> 01:32:56.582 line:82%
I will surround Odela with poisonous air.

951
01:32:56.665 --> 01:32:59.418 line:82%
I will swallow that poison
like Lord Garalakanta.

952
01:32:59.501 --> 01:33:01.378 line:82%
I will burn the place like fire.

953
01:33:01.462 --> 01:33:04.256 line:82%
I will cover the fire
like Lord Nitalaksha.

954
01:33:04.673 --> 01:33:07.593 line:82%
I'll drown this place with floods
like the ferocious Ganga.

955
01:33:07.676 --> 01:33:09.845 line:82%
I will block it like
the Govardhana mountain.

956
01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:13.390 line:82%
I'll cover this place
with darkness and spare no one!

957
01:33:13.557 --> 01:33:16.769 line:82%
I will break through
the darkness like Sudarshana chakra.

958
01:33:24.401 --> 01:33:28.238 line:82%
You and your people will have to chant

959
01:33:28.655 --> 01:33:30.657 line:82%
dead bodies' names
instead of Shiva's name!

960
01:33:30.991 --> 01:33:32.659 line:82%
As long as I’m in Odela,

961
01:33:32.743 --> 01:33:36.080 line:82%
you won’t even dare
touch a blade of grass!

962
01:33:36.288 --> 01:33:39.667 line:82%
The air becomes a hurricane,
the dust becomes ashes.

963
01:33:40.042 --> 01:33:42.461 line:82%
The spirits will stand as the Lord Shiva!

964
01:33:42.878 --> 01:33:44.963 line:82%
Till the event of Kapalamoksha,

965
01:33:45.422 --> 01:33:47.758 line:82%
if you come out of that pit again,

966
01:33:48.133 --> 01:33:50.678 line:82%
I'll destroy your soul!

967
01:33:50.928 --> 01:33:52.971 line:82%
Not hours,

968
01:33:53.514 --> 01:33:56.100 line:82%
count seconds.

969
01:33:56.809 --> 01:34:00.396 line:82%
Let's decide who's better,
the soul or the Supreme!

970
01:34:00.979 --> 01:34:02.690 line:82%
Let's decide!

971
01:34:02.731 --> 01:34:04.566 line:82%
Let's decide!

972
01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.944 line:82%
Let's decide!

973
01:34:19.832 --> 01:34:22.292 line:82%
15 DAYS LATER

974
01:35:07.755 --> 01:35:13.260 line:82%
Radhamma's arrival during
pedda patnam
is also because of His greatness.

975
01:35:13.969 --> 01:35:18.015 line:82%
The village is going to be free
from my husband's torture.

976
01:35:19.099 --> 01:35:22.227 line:82%
Celebrate
Patnalu
like a grand festival.

977
01:35:22.728 --> 01:35:25.439 line:82%
On the second Sunday of July,

978
01:35:25.981 --> 01:35:29.318 line:82%
that is, on the 14th
of the seventh month,

979
01:35:29.485 --> 01:35:34.156 line:82%
the time when the new moon ends
and the full moon fortnight starts,

980
01:35:34.406 --> 01:35:39.078 line:82%
that is exactly the day
when we will be free from him!

981
01:35:40.996 --> 01:35:44.249 line:82%
This time, we shall celebrate
Pedda Patnam
on a grand scale

982
01:35:44.458 --> 01:35:46.585 line:82%
with 40 feet of
Chilaka Patnam
.

983
01:35:46.794 --> 01:35:50.839 line:82%
[chanting in Sanskrit]

984
01:36:22.955 --> 01:36:24.707 line:82%
Hey, Bhairavi!

985
01:36:25.624 --> 01:36:28.293 line:82%
As the weddings
in your houses had to stop,

986
01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.130 line:82%
are you performing
the wedding of Mallanna?

987
01:36:31.463 --> 01:36:35.384 line:82%
How dare you to bind me?

988
01:36:36.051 --> 01:36:37.011 line:82%
Come!

989
01:36:37.302 --> 01:36:38.637 line:82%
Damn you!

990
01:36:38.721 --> 01:36:40.764 line:82%
Come!

991
01:37:14.214 --> 01:37:16.842 line:82%
Why are you glaring like that?

992
01:37:17.843 --> 01:37:21.347 line:82%
Did you think you subdued me?

993
01:37:22.139 --> 01:37:26.101 line:82%
Do you know I got out?

994
01:37:32.066 --> 01:37:35.778 line:82%
Ya, Va, Shri, Ma, Na!

995
01:37:56.548 --> 01:38:00.302 line:82%
I no longer need
a human body to transform.

996
01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:02.054 line:82%
Do you want to see it?

997
01:38:03.597 --> 01:38:04.973 line:82%
Do you all want to see it?

998
01:38:05.224 --> 01:38:07.101 line:82%
Do you want to see me?

999
01:38:28.956 --> 01:38:29.957 line:82%
Damn you!

1000
01:38:30.207 --> 01:38:32.251 line:82%
How dare you bind me?

1001
01:38:32.835 --> 01:38:34.086 line:82%
Watch now!

1002
01:38:34.461 --> 01:38:37.631 line:82%
If a soul takes the form of its mighty form!

1003
01:38:37.923 --> 01:38:40.551 line:82%
See what it looks like! Watch!

1004
01:38:41.051 --> 01:38:42.803 line:82%
Watch now!

1005
01:38:43.303 --> 01:38:45.639 line:82%
I'm in this air!

1006
01:38:46.306 --> 01:38:48.767 line:82%
I'm in that fire!

1007
01:39:10.414 --> 01:39:13.375 line:82%
I'm in that water!

1008
01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.243 line:82%
Hey, Bhairavi!

1009
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:53.499 line:82%
The Pedda Patnams in your village
will not be filled with colors,

1010
01:39:53.791 --> 01:39:56.251 line:82%
but with your blood.

1011
01:39:57.461 --> 01:39:58.671 line:82%
Remember that!

1012
01:39:59.129 --> 01:40:02.174 line:82%
If Lord Shiva was
your strength all these days,

1013
01:40:02.383 --> 01:40:05.761 line:82%
I'll be your fear from now on!

1014
01:40:05.928 --> 01:40:07.930 line:82%
If you are the mantra,

1015
01:40:08.097 --> 01:40:10.474 line:82%
I'll be the tantra!

1016
01:40:10.891 --> 01:40:14.978 line:82%
Air, water, fire, earth, and sky

1017
01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:18.565 line:82%
are but servants to my being.

1018
01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:22.569 line:82%
You won't bind me anymore,

1019
01:40:22.986 --> 01:40:25.698 line:82%
I'll bind the whole village now!

1020
01:40:26.073 --> 01:40:28.492 line:82%
I'm binding Odela!

1021
01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:48.429 line:82%
From now onwards,
no one in this village

1022
01:40:48.512 --> 01:40:50.597 line:82%
whether young, old,

1023
01:40:50.764 --> 01:40:53.767 line:82%
male, female, children... No one!

1024
01:40:54.018 --> 01:40:56.395 line:82%
No one should cross that line!

1025
01:40:58.147 --> 01:41:00.774 line:82%
No school or temple.

1026
01:41:01.191 --> 01:41:04.111 line:82%
No work or crops!

1027
01:41:04.403 --> 01:41:05.529 line:82%
Destruction!

1028
01:41:05.946 --> 01:41:07.906 line:82%
It's Odela's mass destruction!

1029
01:41:58.707 --> 01:42:00.292 line:82%
Didn't I warn you?

1030
01:42:00.876 --> 01:42:04.254 line:82%
If I hear any sound, you'll die!

Rage is foolishness, Shiva!

1066
01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:55.944 line:82%
Isn't it a crime to leave Bhairavi alone
and watch the show, Gurudev?

1067
01:45:56.653 --> 01:46:00.324 line:82%
But if a Naga saint really wanted to,
couldn’t she stop that scoundrel?

1068
01:46:00.657 --> 01:46:02.368 line:82%
What is the Lord testing her, Gurudev?

1069
01:46:02.576 --> 01:46:03.744 line:82%
Don't be naive, Shiva!

1070
01:46:04.078 --> 01:46:08.415 line:82%
Even the Sun God becomes weak
at the time of the eclipse.

1071
01:46:09.249 --> 01:46:12.586 line:82%
To end Tirupati
who possessed all the five elements,

1072
01:46:12.753 --> 01:46:14.880 line:82%
we must unite
the power of the five lingas.

1073
01:46:15.047 --> 01:46:19.009 line:82%
For that great sacrifice to take place,
doesn't Bhairavi need a weapon, Gurudev?

1074
01:46:19.259 --> 01:46:21.261 line:82%
The axe is the weapon of
Parusuram.

1075
01:46:21.303 --> 01:46:23.180 line:82%
The spine is the weapon of
Dhadheechi.

1076
01:46:23.555 --> 01:46:27.851 line:82%
But Bhairavi's weapon is going to be
the
Panchakshari
on her tongue.

1077
01:46:28.102 --> 01:46:31.438 line:82%
How can Bhairavi figure
out this logic, Gurudev?

1078
01:46:32.815 --> 01:46:34.024 line:82%
Patience.

1079
01:46:35.150 --> 01:46:37.945 line:82%
You have seen the battles
being won with weapons.

1080
01:46:38.487 --> 01:46:40.698 line:82%
For the first time in
Kalyuga,

1081
01:46:40.989 --> 01:46:43.158 line:82%
you'll witness a battle
won by the power of
Panchakshari.

1082
01:46:44.284 --> 01:46:45.994 line:82%
She won't fight!

1083
01:46:46.412 --> 01:46:48.038 line:82%
She will be prepared by Shiva.

1084
01:46:48.414 --> 01:46:52.626 line:82%
She'll not win this war
with her strength, but with her devotion.

1085
01:46:57.047 --> 01:46:57.923 line:82%
Dear!

1086
01:46:58.007 --> 01:46:59.967 line:82%
What has happened to you, dear?

1087
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:01.510 line:82%
Save her, Mother!

1088
01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.637 line:82%
-Save her, Save her!
-What happened?

1089
01:47:03.804 --> 01:47:05.014 line:82%
What happened to the child?

1090
01:47:05.055 --> 01:47:07.266 line:82%
She has had Asthma from her childhood.

1091
01:47:07.433 --> 01:47:11.061 line:82%
She wanted to go to school
and put her life at risk.

1092
01:47:11.687 --> 01:47:15.607 line:82%
We can't cross the line
to take her to the hospital.

1093
01:47:15.816 --> 01:47:18.610 line:82%
But she doesn't know that!

1094
01:47:21.196 --> 01:47:23.657 line:82%
Mother!

1095
01:47:23.782 --> 01:47:26.618 line:82%
I heard that you possess some powers.

1096
01:47:26.744 --> 01:47:31.206 line:82%
Please save my daughter's life!
Please keep her alive.

1097
01:47:31.832 --> 01:47:34.168 line:82%
It's not me who can
save your daughter...

1098
01:47:35.836 --> 01:47:36.920 line:82%
It's Radha.

1099
01:47:37.171 --> 01:47:38.339 line:82%
Me?

1100
01:47:39.673 --> 01:47:42.468 line:82%
Giving birth creates a bond
greater than shared blood.

1101
01:47:43.594 --> 01:47:47.681 line:82%
Even greater than that is the bond
of marriage. It is sacred!

1102
01:47:48.515 --> 01:47:52.019 line:82%
Use that power to untie this binding.

1103
01:47:52.811 --> 01:47:53.937 line:82%
How?

1104
01:48:01.779 --> 01:48:05.449 line:82%
Use your position as his wife
to distract him.

1105
01:48:05.824 --> 01:48:09.787 line:82%
I'll weaken his restraint over the village
using the
panchakshari.

1106
01:48:10.788 --> 01:48:14.291 line:82%
If we can join forces
to save that child's life,

1107
01:48:14.833 --> 01:48:17.544 line:82%
we'll be breathing life
into this village's belief.

1108
01:48:18.128 --> 01:48:20.798 line:82%
As the chants of Namah Shivaya echo
through the mic,

1109
01:48:21.423 --> 01:48:24.218 line:82%
he’ll tremble and grow weak.

1110
01:48:24.635 --> 01:48:26.387 line:82%
At that moment, they can cross the line.

1111
01:48:36.689 --> 01:48:39.400 line:82%
Tirupati! You made a mistake.

1112
01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:43.987 line:82%
I made a bigger mistake by killing you.

1113
01:48:48.283 --> 01:48:50.577 line:82%
[starts chanting]

1114
01:48:57.501 --> 01:48:59.378 line:82%
If I hadn't killed you,

1115
01:49:00.462 --> 01:49:02.923 line:82%
all this would never have happened.

1116
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:05.634 line:82%
The village wouldn't have suffered.

1117
01:49:06.135 --> 01:49:08.262 line:82%
You wouldn't be in such great pain.

1118
01:49:08.846 --> 01:49:10.973 line:82%
Everything is my fault!

1119
01:49:15.853 --> 01:49:20.733 line:82%
Listen, Tirupati.
I'm here, just as you wished.

1120
01:49:28.198 --> 01:49:30.659 line:82%
Hey! Cut the power off.
It seems to be a sandstorm.

1121
01:49:30.743 --> 01:49:31.910 line:82%
Okay. I'll cut it.

1122
01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:36.081 line:82%
I wore my wedding saree,
just like you prefer.

1123
01:49:37.333 --> 01:49:39.793 line:82%
I even wore the bangles you like.

1124
01:49:40.419 --> 01:49:42.379 line:82%
I sprayed your favorite perfume.

1125
01:49:42.671 --> 01:49:44.256 line:82%
Look at this!

1126
01:49:44.798 --> 01:49:48.427 line:82%
Even this
thaali
you tied
doesn’t melt your heart?

1127
01:49:58.437 --> 01:50:00.105 line:82%
Come, Tirupati.

1128
01:50:01.148 --> 01:50:04.234 line:82%
Please come and kill me!

1129
01:50:04.943 --> 01:50:06.945 line:82%
But spare this village.

1130
01:50:25.756 --> 01:50:27.132 line:82%
Come, Tirupati.

1131
01:50:27.633 --> 01:50:30.844 line:82%
Come and kill me! Come!

1132
01:50:40.396 --> 01:50:41.397 line:82%
What happened?

1133
01:50:41.522 --> 01:50:42.981 line:82%
Did you cut the power line?

1134
01:50:43.273 --> 01:50:45.818 line:82%
I'm getting continuous calls
from the higher-ups.

1135
01:50:46.026 --> 01:50:47.194 line:82%
I'm on it, brother.

1136
01:51:09.466 --> 01:51:10.884 line:82%
Damn you!

1137
01:51:17.474 --> 01:51:20.477 line:82%
Where are you going?
Wait, Tirupati.

1138
01:51:23.605 --> 01:51:24.732 line:82%
Wait!

1139
01:51:25.899 --> 01:51:26.942 line:82%
Tirupati!

1140
01:51:27.568 --> 01:51:30.487 line:82%
Where are you going?
Wait, Tirupati.

1141
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.785 line:82%
Wait, Tirupati.

1142
01:51:51.842 --> 01:51:53.469 line:82%
Damn you!

1143
01:51:53.594 --> 01:51:55.804 line:82%
You betrayed me again.

1144
01:51:56.013 --> 01:52:01.226 line:82%
The entire village hatched a plan
to save a girl's life, huh?

1145
01:52:01.727 --> 01:52:06.940 line:82%
Do you all want to see
how it's like when the girl beheads you?

1146
01:52:07.399 --> 01:52:08.817 line:82%
Do you want to see?

1147
01:53:30.816 --> 01:53:34.319 line:82%
Life, death, joy, sorrow,
and the fruit of your actions

1148
01:53:34.528 --> 01:53:36.071 line:82%
must all be endured.

1149
01:53:52.504 --> 01:53:54.631 line:82%
They're saying you're following
in Bapamma's footprints.

1150
01:53:54.882 --> 01:53:59.094 line:82%
That you're a Shiva Shakti,
and a Naga Sadhu, huh?

1151
01:53:59.345 --> 01:54:01.764 line:82%
So why are you at my feet?

1152
01:54:02.014 --> 01:54:04.141 line:82%
Did a shiver run down your spine

1153
01:54:04.266 --> 01:54:07.603 line:82%
and a cold fever
rush through your veins?

1154
01:54:09.104 --> 01:54:13.859 line:82%
You're turning the village barren
and piling up dead bodies.

1155
01:54:14.943 --> 01:54:17.446 line:82%
The village can't bear it anymore!

1156
01:54:18.489 --> 01:54:20.908 line:82%
What can we do to calm your anger?

1157
01:54:21.116 --> 01:54:22.868 line:82%
I knelt and begged,

1158
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:25.287 line:82%
pleading to be spared.

1159
01:54:25.454 --> 01:54:29.124 line:82%
Yet, no one in this village
listened to me.

1160
01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.753 line:82%
By giving a burial
punishment to my dead body,

1161
01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:35.547 line:82%
they made my soul suffer
immense agony.

1162
01:54:35.756 --> 01:54:37.675 line:82%
Will I let them go?

1163
01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:41.136 line:82%
I'm apologizing for their mistake.

1164
01:54:42.429 --> 01:54:44.306 line:82%
Your family ended up on the streets,

1165
01:54:44.431 --> 01:54:46.934 line:82%
and now you killed your own wife.

1166
01:54:47.434 --> 01:54:49.812 line:82%
What will make your anger subside?

1167
01:54:49.937 --> 01:54:53.482 line:82%
What should this village
do to appease your anger?

1168
01:54:53.649 --> 01:54:56.527 line:82%
The village doesn’t have to do
anything. It's you!

1169
01:54:56.819 --> 01:54:59.780 line:82%
Since you hit puberty at twelve,

1170
01:54:59.905 --> 01:55:04.243 line:82%
you’ve been nurturing
and hiding your beauty.

1171
01:55:04.326 --> 01:55:06.662 line:82%
Now, lay it at my feet.

1172
01:55:07.121 --> 01:55:08.872 line:82%
You've grown up to be desirable.

1173
01:55:09.123 --> 01:55:10.958 line:82%
Now, abandon your Shiva.

1174
01:55:11.166 --> 01:55:13.127 line:82%
And I will let go of my anger.

1175
01:55:13.544 --> 01:55:16.797 line:82%
I will liberate your virginity
that is longing for the three-eyed One

1176
01:55:17.047 --> 01:55:19.633 line:82%
with my masculinity.

1177
01:55:20.050 --> 01:55:24.054 line:82%
I will indulge with you intensely
until blood oozes from your sweat pores,

1178
01:55:24.304 --> 01:55:27.891 line:82%
and fulfill my revenge on this village.

1179
01:55:28.225 --> 01:55:30.352 line:82%
This soul, Tirupati’s soul,
promises you!

1180
01:55:30.686 --> 01:55:32.771 line:82%
Abandon your path to salvation,

1181
01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:35.983 line:82%
and I will bring
liberation to this village.

1182
01:55:54.168 --> 01:55:57.379 line:82%
What? Are you thinking?

1183
01:55:58.630 --> 01:56:01.759 line:82%
You can't abandon
your Shiva, can you?

1184
01:56:08.015 --> 01:56:10.392 line:82%
I'm... ready.

1185
01:56:10.726 --> 01:56:14.396 line:82%
Then get ready like a bride.

1186
01:56:16.357 --> 01:56:22.112 line:82%
On that side, Peddha Patnam,
and on this side, I'm by your side.

1187
01:56:37.336 --> 01:56:38.754 line:82%
Hold on, dear.

1188
01:56:39.630 --> 01:56:40.923 line:82%
Don't go into the village.

1189
01:56:42.091 --> 01:56:43.092 line:82%
Go that way.

1190
01:56:44.385 --> 01:56:45.886 line:82%
We made a mistake.

1191
01:56:47.054 --> 01:56:50.349 line:82%
Bringing you here was our mistake.

1192
01:56:52.685 --> 01:56:54.228 line:82%
We thought God existed.

1193
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:58.691 line:82%
We thought there were Shiva Shaktis
like you who believe in God.

1194
01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:02.736 line:82%
But there's no God.

1195
01:57:03.237 --> 01:57:05.531 line:82%
He said he'll destroy the village.

1196
01:57:05.698 --> 01:57:09.535 line:82%
He won't quit until
he turns Odela into a burial ground.

1197
01:57:11.412 --> 01:57:12.621 line:82%
You go away, dear.

1198
01:57:12.913 --> 01:57:15.582 line:82%
Go your own way.

1199
01:57:16.458 --> 01:57:19.003 line:82%
-You're mistaken, uncle.
-Not at all, my dear.

1200
01:57:19.962 --> 01:57:22.631 line:82%
What wrong
did your poor sister Radha do

1201
01:57:23.215 --> 01:57:25.009 line:82%
that he brutally killed her
on the village outskirts,

1202
01:57:25.092 --> 01:57:26.510 line:82%
like an offering to Poshamma?

1203
01:57:27.678 --> 01:57:29.430 line:82%
What God are you talking about?

1204
01:57:30.055 --> 01:57:31.390 line:82%
God doesn't exist.

1205
01:57:31.807 --> 01:57:34.018 line:82%
God doesn't exist.
He doesn't.

1206
01:57:35.019 --> 01:57:37.229 line:82%
God doesn't exist.
God doesn't exist.

1207
01:57:37.271 --> 01:57:39.773 line:82%
He doesn't exist!
God doesn't exist.

1208
01:57:41.942 --> 01:57:43.318 line:82%
Dear.

1209
01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:47.197 line:82%
He exists.

1210
01:57:50.284 --> 01:57:51.994 line:82%
Shiva is here.

1211
01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:56.623 line:82%
We’re here and alive...

1212
01:57:56.999 --> 01:58:00.377 line:82%
only because of Shiva.

1213
01:58:01.587 --> 01:58:04.256 line:82%
Without his command,
you wouldn’t come to me,

1214
01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:06.258 line:82%
and I wouldn’t go near that grave.

1215
01:58:06.383 --> 01:58:09.470 line:82%
Lord Shiva
will protect this village.

1216
01:58:09.636 --> 01:58:11.680 line:82%
What protection are we
talking about?

1217
01:58:12.431 --> 01:58:16.602 line:82%
After losing you,
what's the use of this village?

1218
01:58:16.769 --> 01:58:20.356 line:82%
Why don't the entire village
hang themselves?

1219
01:58:21.482 --> 01:58:23.942 line:82%
There is no Shiva.
He doesn't exist.

1220
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:26.070 line:82%
If He did, He would have
come to protect the village, wouldn't He?

1221
01:58:26.153 --> 01:58:27.905 line:82%
There is no Shiva.
Shiva is not there.

1222
01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:29.406 line:82%
Shiva doesn't exist!

1223
01:58:45.464 --> 01:58:48.884 line:82%
You said He doesn't exist.
What did we hear?

1224
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:50.928 line:82%
Wasn't that
Omkara?

1225
01:58:56.684 --> 01:59:00.521 line:82%
Don’t you hear
Omkara
in that child’s wailing?

1226
01:59:07.695 --> 01:59:09.321 line:82%
The formless Brahma,

1227
01:59:09.905 --> 01:59:12.366 line:82%
the essence of the Vedas,
permeates the three worlds...

1228
01:59:13.605 --> 01:59:15.106 line:82%
Omkara
is all there is.

1229
01:59:15.357 --> 01:59:17.984 line:82%
In every sound,
in every silence,

1230
01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:20.320 line:82%
in every object,
in the void,

1231
01:59:20.345 --> 01:59:22.781 line:82%
in every form
and formlessness,

1232
01:59:23.573 --> 01:59:25.951 line:82%
there is nothing but
Omkara.

1233
01:59:26.135 --> 01:59:28.119 line:82%
He is the one who dwells everywhere.

1234
01:59:28.328 --> 01:59:29.829 line:82%
He resides in the whole universe.

1235
01:59:31.915 --> 01:59:34.209 line:82%
It is His divine command.

1236
01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:39.089 line:82%
He will protect his people.

1237
01:59:55.355 --> 01:59:58.483 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

She’s not foolish enough to say
Namah Shivaya to me.

1262
02:02:36.641 --> 02:02:37.892 line:82%
She was trying to say something.

1263
02:02:38.435 --> 02:02:39.644 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1264
02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:41.855 line:82%
Shivaya Namah.

1265
02:02:42.731 --> 02:02:44.107 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1266
02:02:44.858 --> 02:02:47.402 line:82%
Na... Ma... Shi...

1267
02:02:50.155 --> 02:02:52.699 line:82%
Namah Shivaya is
five letters, Venkatesh.

1268
02:02:53.408 --> 02:02:54.743 line:82%
'Na' represents the Earth,

1269
02:02:54.993 --> 02:02:56.328 line:82%
'Ma' represents water,

1270
02:02:56.745 --> 02:02:57.996 line:82%
'Shi' represents fire,

1271
02:02:58.413 --> 02:02:59.748 line:82%
'Va' represents air,

1272
02:03:00.373 --> 02:03:01.708 line:82%
and 'Ya' represents the sky.

1273
02:03:02.417 --> 02:03:04.628 line:82%
The five syllables cover
the five elements of nature.

1274
02:03:05.795 --> 02:03:10.550 line:82%
Tirupati's soul controls
the five syllables and the five elements.

1275
02:03:11.509 --> 02:03:13.261 line:82%
What's the connection
between the two, brother?

1276
02:03:16.473 --> 02:03:19.392 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1277
02:03:22.646 --> 02:03:24.522 line:82%
Why did she say
'Namah Shivaya' in that way?

1278
02:03:24.898 --> 02:03:27.525 line:82%
This gesture means salvation.
Salvation means death.

1279
02:03:28.401 --> 02:03:29.694 line:82%
Salvation to whom?

1280
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:33.239 line:82%
For the village? Or for him?
Who will get salvation?

1281
02:03:42.165 --> 02:03:43.583 line:82%
Kapalamoksha.

1282
02:03:44.209 --> 02:03:46.086 line:82%
Who didn't attain
Kapalamoksha
?

1283
02:03:47.087 --> 02:03:48.171 line:82%
Tirupati.

1284
02:03:48.922 --> 02:03:50.382 line:82%
We gave him the burial punishment, right?

1285
02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:52.008 line:82%
Kapalamoksha
was denied.

1286
02:03:53.802 --> 02:03:56.346 line:82%
It's clear to me.
Now, I understand.

1287
02:03:57.263 --> 02:03:58.473 line:82%
Kapalamoksham!

1288
02:04:18.618 --> 02:04:20.287 line:82%
What's going on here, Gurudeva?

1289
02:04:20.745 --> 02:04:23.999 line:82%
Bhairavi has maintained her celibacy as
an embodiment of Shiva's feminine energy.

1290
02:04:24.541 --> 02:04:26.710 line:82%
Why is she giving up everything
for the village's sake?

1291
02:04:26.793 --> 02:04:29.546 line:82%
Will she achieve her goal
if she loses her celibacy?

1292
02:04:29.838 --> 02:04:33.049 line:82%
Lord Shiva doesn't value
celibacy... he values sacrifice.

1293
02:04:34.134 --> 02:04:38.138 line:82%
Kannappa offered his eyes, and Siriyala
sacrificed his son and became legendary.

1294
02:04:38.805 --> 02:04:42.309 line:82%
The test of devotion
isn't love but sacrifice.

1295
02:04:42.726 --> 02:04:45.645 line:82%
Who will Tirupati's soul possess now?

1296
02:04:45.979 --> 02:04:47.105 line:82%
What is it going to do?

1297
02:04:48.606 --> 02:04:51.067 line:82%
"I embody both love and death."

1298
02:04:51.735 --> 02:04:54.529 line:82%
"I am the test and the solution."

1299
02:04:55.071 --> 02:04:58.700 line:82%
Watch Lord Shiva's divine play
unfolding through his devotees.

1300
02:05:34.235 --> 02:05:35.153 line:82%
Damn!

1301
02:05:35.195 --> 02:05:40.533 line:82%
Ripe! You are so ripe for the taking.

1302
02:06:17.612 --> 02:06:18.989 line:82%
What is it?

1303
02:06:20.073 --> 02:06:22.075 line:82%
What is happening?

1304
02:06:24.244 --> 02:06:28.206 line:82%
You, along with Allah Bakhsh
and the villagers, are up to something.

1305
02:06:28.707 --> 02:06:29.708 line:82%
What is it?

1306
02:06:31.001 --> 02:06:34.504 line:82%
On one side, you are worshipping
Lord Shiva with
Pedda Patnalu.

1307
02:06:35.755 --> 02:06:38.675 line:82%
On the other, you are digging my grave.

1308
02:06:39.801 --> 02:06:42.929 line:82%
All the villagers together are
going to do something!

1309
02:06:44.097 --> 02:06:45.598 line:82%
You idiots!

1310
02:06:45.807 --> 02:06:47.475 line:82%
With this village as a witness,

1311
02:06:48.018 --> 02:06:51.563 line:82%
with these people as witnesses,
I will enjoy you!

1312
02:06:52.605 --> 02:06:54.691 line:82%
I will enjoy!

1313
02:07:23.803 --> 02:07:25.972 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1314
02:07:41.112 --> 02:07:43.573 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1315
02:07:50.747 --> 02:07:52.499 line:82%
Tirupati became a dead body.

1316
02:07:52.582 --> 02:07:55.961 line:82%
Dead body got
burial punishment, which was hell.

1317
02:07:56.002 --> 02:07:58.755 line:82%
Due to that, his soul
became an evil spirit

1318
02:07:58.797 --> 02:08:01.967 line:82%
and came back for vengeance!
Look! This is the result of that!

1319
02:08:19.150 --> 02:08:25.740 line:82%
Lord Shiva, Shankaraiah, Basavaiah,
Sambaiah, Janagamaiah. Damn!

1320
02:08:26.366 --> 02:08:30.704 line:82%
He has as many names
as the villagers' names in Odela.

1321
02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:35.041 line:82%
Let him come and protect her.

1322
02:08:37.002 --> 02:08:43.049 line:82%
From children to the elderly, everyone
must witness what I do to her.

1323
02:08:43.967 --> 02:08:46.511 line:82%
They should keep their eyes
wide open and see.

1324
02:08:48.179 --> 02:08:50.473 line:82%
If any of you dare close your eyes...

1325
02:08:50.724 --> 02:08:53.977 line:82%
I will toy with your dead bodies!

1326
02:08:58.315 --> 02:09:01.192 line:82%
It’s not him you should be
offering
Pedda Patnam,

1327
02:09:01.818 --> 02:09:02.944 line:82%
Offer them to me.

1328
02:09:14.664 --> 02:09:15.999 line:82%
The smell.

1329
02:09:16.583 --> 02:09:20.754 line:82%
Your damn scent.

1330
02:09:27.927 --> 02:09:32.349 line:82%
You are fresher than
turmeric or vermilion!

1331
02:09:36.728 --> 02:09:38.980 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1332
02:09:41.858 --> 02:09:43.860 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1333
02:09:47.322 --> 02:09:48.990 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1334
02:09:52.535 --> 02:09:55.830 line:82%
Why are you chanting
Namah Shivaya?

1335
02:09:56.831 --> 02:09:59.459 line:82%
It is Tirupati who will enjoy you.

1336
02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:04.255 line:82%
I should be on top of you,
with my name on your lips!

1337
02:10:05.799 --> 02:10:07.550 line:82%
Only my name!

1338
02:10:07.801 --> 02:10:09.594 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1339
02:11:39.684 --> 02:11:41.895 line:82%
Namah Shivaya.

1340
02:11:46.024 --> 02:11:48.568 line:82%
Again with the same noise!

1341
02:11:49.694 --> 02:11:52.197 line:82%
Mallana isn't the one
who won over death.

1342
02:11:52.614 --> 02:11:55.116 line:82%
It's Tirupati who's alive
even after he died!

1343
