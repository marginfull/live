Yes. We do.

The Reserve Army
has thousands of men
all over Berlin.

Valkyrie is Hitler's

minor obstacles, Colonel.

225

would have to be rewritten
to exclude the SS.

is one thing.

In this case,

230

evidence of high treason.

Hitler's signature.

235
00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:34.100 line:83%
He's the commander
of the Reserve Army.

236

I can put
the reserve troops
on alert,

237
00:25:35.902 --> 00:25:38.404 line:83%

can initiate Valkyrie.

00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:16.408 line:83%
Now you're just as
guilty as the rest of us.

310
00:31:16.442 --> 00:31:18.844 line:83%
And you think
that makes me
a sympathizer, hey?

311
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:21.547 line:83%
Give a man a choice of
betraying his fellow
officer or his Fuhrer

312
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.116 line:83%
and you think his actions
will show you his heart.

313
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.119 line:83%
It is not that simple.
Yes. Yes, it is.

314
00:31:27.153 --> 00:31:30.923 line:83%
For the last time,
don't push me to
make a decision.

315
00:31:30.957 --> 00:31:33.625 line:83%
I don't have a choice.
It's clear now.

316
00:31:35.594 --> 00:31:38.965 line:83%
Without you,
there is no hope
of success.

317
00:31:38.998 --> 00:31:41.567 line:83%
You're nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship!

318
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.970 line:83%
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

319
00:31:44.003 --> 00:31:46.605 line:83%
What makes you think
you're stronger than
the people, the Reich?

320
00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:48.240 line:83%
The very momentum
of history!

321
00:31:48.274 --> 00:31:49.608 line:83%
This is going to happen.

322
00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:53.145 line:83%
Action is inevitable,
as are the consequences.

323
00:31:53.179 --> 00:31:54.746 line:83%
When they come for me,
I'll do everything I can

324
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.415 line:83%
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it,

325
00:31:56.448 --> 00:31:58.217 line:83%
but don't delude yourself.

326
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.319 line:83%
You were involved
in a crime
against your country

327
00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:02.288 line:83%
long before you met me.

328
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.359 line:83%
There may still be time
to redeem yourself.

329
00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:12.965 line:83%
Only God can
judge us now.

330
00:32:20.006 --> 00:32:21.940 line:83%
STAUFFENBERG: Hitler had
Operation Valkyrie designed

331
00:32:21.974 --> 00:32:24.776 line:83%
to completely secure
his government
in six hours.

332
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.515 line:83%
I'm rewriting the order
so we can seize control
of the government in three.

333
00:32:29.548 --> 00:32:31.283 line:83%
As written,
the order spreads
reserve troops

334
00:32:31.317 --> 00:32:33.785 line:83%
across all of Germany's
19 military districts,

335
00:32:33.819 --> 00:32:38.257 line:83%
including occupied cities
like Paris, Vienna
and Prague.

336
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.092 line:83%
This is a waste
of resources.

337
00:32:40.126 --> 00:32:43.629 line:83%
Since all of these districts
follow orders from Berlin
without question,

338
00:32:43.662 --> 00:32:46.132 line:83%
you take Berlin,
you take Germany.

339
00:32:47.499 --> 00:32:49.168 line:83%
I'm rewriting Valkyrie

340
00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:50.869 line:83%
to direct the majority
of our strongest units

341
00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:53.072 line:83%
to focus
entirely on Berlin.

342
00:32:54.373 --> 00:32:55.774 line:83%
We'll surround
the government quarter,

343
00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.943 line:83%
occupy all SS
and police barracks.

344
00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:59.645 line:83%
Once we have control
of the government,

345
00:32:59.678 --> 00:33:02.448 line:83%
we'll shut down
all concentration camps.

346
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:05.184 line:83%
Any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot.

347
00:33:05.217 --> 00:33:07.719 line:83%
I've been transferred
to the front.

348
00:33:11.157 --> 00:33:12.624 line:83%
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

349
00:33:12.658 --> 00:33:15.527 line:83%
You know these orders
better than anyone.

350
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:19.198 line:83%
That's why I'm putting you
in charge of the military
wing of the operation.

351
00:33:19.231 --> 00:33:20.399 line:83%
Beck agrees.

352
00:33:20.432 --> 00:33:21.567 line:83%
Why not Olbricht?

353
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.737 line:83%
No. It's your plan. It's you.

354
00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:27.973 line:83%
One more thing.
You need to be
absolutely certain

355
00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:30.042 line:83%
no conflicting orders
get out after the flash.

356
00:33:30.076 --> 00:33:32.644 line:83%
It is not enough
to kill Hitler.

357
00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:34.480 line:83%
We need to isolate
his chain of command

358
00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:37.083 line:83%
and cut them off
from the outside
world immediately.

359
00:33:37.116 --> 00:33:40.018 line:83%
Yes, I've already
considered that.

360
00:33:40.052 --> 00:33:41.920 line:83%
I think I have just
the man who can help.

361
00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:44.423 line:83%
Who is he?

362
00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:46.292 line:83%
Perhaps it's better
I don't say.

363
00:33:50.429 --> 00:33:53.265 line:83%
You know,
God promised Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom

364
00:33:53.299 --> 00:33:56.702 line:83%
if he could find
just 10 righteous men.

365
00:33:56.735 --> 00:34:00.539 line:83%
I have a feeling that,
for Germany,
it may come down to one.

366
00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:08.414 line:83%

I get to relax.

373
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:47.519 line:83%
You've been promoted
Chief of Staff
for the Reserve Army.

374

Excuse me?
Congratulations.

Unfortunately,

376

don't count as service
to the Reich.

377

I'll refuse the promotion.

378
00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:03.068 line:83%
You'll do no such thing.

Tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation,

380

but in this world
I still outrank you.

00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:10.142 line:83%
You will accept
the promotion.

382

You'll have real
access to Hitler,

383

We need this.

384

your changes to Valkyrie.

385

462
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:36.014 line:83%
This is state-of-the-art.
You can have small
or precise, not both.

463
00:43:36.047 --> 00:43:38.283 line:83%
Might this just be
a little too small?

464
00:43:38.316 --> 00:43:41.753 line:83%
No. Hitler's bunker
will magnify the blast.

465
00:43:41.787 --> 00:43:45.791 line:83%
It is constructed of
reinforced concrete.
Steel door, no windows.

466
00:43:45.824 --> 00:43:49.194 line:83%
The air pressure generated by
just one of these explosives
in a space like that

467
00:43:49.227 --> 00:43:51.029 line:83%
will kill everyone
instantly.

468
00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:53.364 line:83%
The second charge
will be entirely redundant.

469
00:43:53.398 --> 00:43:57.302 line:83%
If, by some miracle,
Hitler does survive,
what then?

470
00:43:57.335 --> 00:43:59.705 line:83%
We still initiate Valkyrie.

471
00:43:59.738 --> 00:44:02.140 line:83%
At that point,
there will be
no turning back.

472
00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:04.342 line:83%
But we'll have
an advantage.

473
00:44:05.677 --> 00:44:08.146 line:83%
We have an inside man
at the Wolf's Lair.

474
00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:11.116 line:83%
After the flash,
he'll cut off communication
with the outside world.

475
00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:13.484 line:83%
While Hitler's inner circle
is struggling to regroup,

476
00:44:13.518 --> 00:44:18.223 line:83%
we'll have
the momentum we need to
seize control in Berlin.

477
00:44:18.256 --> 00:44:20.558 line:83%
Himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well.

478
00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:23.494 line:83%
Don't proceed unless
you can get them both.

479
00:44:23.528 --> 00:44:25.063 line:83%
What?

480
00:44:25.096 --> 00:44:29.667 line:83%
Don't proceed unless
you're confident you can get
both Himmler and Hitler.

481
00:44:35.874 --> 00:44:38.043 line:83%
This is Goerdeler, isn't it?

482
00:44:42.047 --> 00:44:44.850 line:83%
I'll hold off,
if the decision
is unanimous,

483
00:44:44.883 --> 00:44:48.887 line:83%
but I want another man
on the committee.
Not a politician.

484
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.222 line:83%
Who?
Him.

485
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:54.192 line:83%
OLBRICHT: Him?
STAUFFENBERG: Him.

486
00:44:55.093 --> 00:44:56.227 line:83%
Fine.

487
00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:01.532 line:83%
But remember,
this is a military operation.

according to plan.

489

to Bamberg.

Good morning.

495
00:46:27.318 --> 00:46:31.289 line:83%
Hitler has scheduled
a military briefing
for today at 1:00.

496
00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:34.259 line:83%
Stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present.

497
00:46:34.292 --> 00:46:36.694 line:83%
They're here.
BECK: Before arming
the explosives,

498
00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:39.664 line:83%
Stauffenberg will call
for authorization to proceed.

499
00:46:39.697 --> 00:46:41.967 line:83%
After the flash,
his inside man

500
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.635 line:83%
will sever all communications.

501
00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:47.205 line:83%
Assuming Fromm
refuses to join us,

502
00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:49.474 line:83%
Olbricht would take command
of the Reserve Army

503
00:46:49.507 --> 00:46:51.476 line:83%
and initiate Valkyrie.
Initiate Valkyrie.

504
00:46:51.509 --> 00:46:53.211 line:83%
Then he'll notify
all district commanders

505
00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:55.881 line:83%
that the SS is attempting
to seize power.

506
00:46:55.914 --> 00:47:00.385 line:83%
The Reserve Army
will arrest all SS, Gestapo
and Nazi officials.

507
00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:02.653 line:83%
By then, Stauffenberg
will have returned to Berlin

508
00:47:02.687 --> 00:47:05.156 line:83%
and taken command
of the Reserve Army.

509
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.894 line:83%
Witzleben and I will assume
the roles of commander of
the armed forces

510
00:47:08.927 --> 00:47:10.495 line:83%
and head of state.

511
00:47:10.528 --> 00:47:12.097 line:83%
With Berlin secured,

512
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.832 line:83%
Dr. Goerdeler will
address the nation
as our new chancellor.

513
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.802 line:83%
Then, God willing,

514
00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:20.038 line:83%
we can negotiate a truce
with the Allies

515
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:22.707 line:83%
and save Europe from
total destruction.

516
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:28.013 line:83%
This will identify you
as a member of the operation.

517

Nobody gets in or out of
the perimeter without one.

the Reserve Army for
