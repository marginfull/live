00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:28.667 line:80%
Good evening.

2
00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:30.625 line:80%
Sir, where's your badge?

3
00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:33.583 line:80%
I have it here.
My wife's so clumsy and forgot to…

4
00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.625 line:80%
Where's your discipline? Okay.

5
00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:38.375 line:80%
Tonight, we'll conduct an operation
against illegal immigrants.

6
00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:44.667 line:80%
Catch them. Don't let them get away.

7
00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:47.250 line:80%
Hey, don't run!

8
00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:40.667 line:80%
Nice place.

9
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.667 line:80%
Are you going to KL?

10
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.500 line:80%
I mean, are you going to KL?

11
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.542 line:80%
-I'm going to Kuala Lumpur.
-Yes, that's KL.

12
00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:53.958 line:80%
My friend's coming to pick me up.
His name is Babuji, from the company.

13
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.083 line:80%
-What company?
-Rama-Rama Graphic?

14
00:01:58.417 --> 00:01:59.500 line:80%
That's me.

15
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000 line:80%
Sorry, sir.

16
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.042 line:80%
Babuji's unwell.

17
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:05.833 line:80%
His grandmother passed away last night.

18
00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.792 line:80%
Really?

19
00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:15.708 line:80%
Sir, are you okay?

20
00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:17.958 line:80%
Okay. But you don't have to ask.

21
00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.167 line:80%
Please remove that.

22
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.458 line:80%
This one, sir?

23
00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:24.250 line:80%
Yes.

24
00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:26.250 line:80%
Okay.

25
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.000 line:80%
Faster.

26
00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:30.792 line:80%
-Kuala Lumpur, sir.
-Yes, we're going to Kuala Lumpur.

27
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:32.542 line:80%
Not KL, but Kuala Lumpur.

28
00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:56.792 line:80%
Why is everything I see green, sir?

29
00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:58.208 line:80%
Everywhere is green, sir.

30
00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.292 line:80%
Now, you'll only see trees.

31
00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:03.333 line:80%
After this,

32
00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.958 line:80%
you'll no longer see any trees.

33
00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:10.125 line:80%
You'll only see buildings.

34
00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:34.833 line:80%
Thank you very much, sir.

35
00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:37.167 line:80%
You know, since I met you,

36
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.708 line:80%
everyone was very polite, sir.

37
00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:42.000 line:80%
Sir, I hope I can you see again.

38
00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:44.208 line:80%
You have brought luck to my life.

39
00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:45.750 line:80%
Thank you, sir.

40
00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:50.333 line:80%
Hey! Where are you going?

41
00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:54.333 line:80%
You have to pay first before you leave.

42
00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:56.667 line:80%
What are you saying, sir?

43
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.417 line:80%
I've already given you
the cash for the toll.

44
00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:03.083 line:80%
You've only just got here
and you're already trying to screw me.

45
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.167 line:80%
Do you think it was free?

46
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.625 line:80%
Don't try to make any trouble here.

47
00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.750 line:80%
No, sir!

48
00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:13.417 line:80%
What did you tell me earlier?

49
00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:16.667 line:80%
You said you were sent by Babuji, right?

50
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.833 line:80%
-This is not right, sir.
-Do you want me to slap you?

51
00:04:19.917 --> 00:04:23.542 line:80%
Just because you're taller,
do you think I can't slap you in the face?

52
00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:28.083 line:80%
I don't want to argue,
but if you don't pay,

53
00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.667 line:80%
-I'll bring you to the police station.
-Okay.

54
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.417 line:80%
Okay, sir. A thousand apologies.

55
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.375 line:80%
You came to my country without a permit.

56
00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.208 line:80%
You can end up in prison.

57
00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:38.917 line:80%
A thousand apologies, sir.

58
00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:40.917 line:80%
How much, sir?

59
00:04:41.208 --> 00:04:42.250 line:80%
250 ringgit.

60
00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:45.000 line:80%
250 ringgit?
That's way too expensive, sir.

61
00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:46.875 line:80%
Then how much can you pay?

62
00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.333 line:80%
-How about ten ringgit?
-Ten ringgit my foot.

63
00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:52.750 line:80%
Who do you think I am?

64
00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:53.875 line:80%
A bus driver?

65
00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:57.417 line:80%
Normally, from the airport to here,

66
00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.750 line:80%
the fare would be 350 ringgit. Normally.

67
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.208 line:80%
But for you, I've already given
a discount. It's 250 ringgit.

68
00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:05.000 line:80%
Okay, I'll give you more.

69
00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:07.583 line:80%
-RM200.
-How about RM30?

70
00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:08.667 line:80%
-RM200.
-RM50?

71
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.375 line:80%
-RM200.
-RM75?

72
00:05:10.458 --> 00:05:12.542 line:80%
-RM200.
-RM80?

73
00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:15.833 line:80%
RM80? You can pay the police. Police!

74
00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:18.250 line:80%
Okay, sir, I'll pay.

75
00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.333 line:80%
Hurry up!

76
00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:22.250 line:80%
Hurry up!

77
00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:24.250 line:80%
Two hundred.

78
00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.375 line:80%
Four pieces.

79
00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:29.417 line:80%
I'd better leave before I get a ticket.

80
00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:34.625 line:80%
What now? This must be your bad luck.

81
00:05:35.083 --> 00:05:37.125 line:80%
Why are you just looking?

82
00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:39.208 line:80%
Help me push the car!

83
00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:42.375 line:80%
Behind. Hurry up before the police arrive.

84
00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:47.667 line:80%
Okay, thank you.

85
00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:50.083 line:80%
Thank you.

86
00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:08.542 line:80%
Rama-Rama.

87
00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.125 line:80%
-Sir!
-Oh my God.

88
00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:14.208 line:80%
Greetings.

89
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:15.708 line:80%
What is it, son?

90
00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:17.708 line:80%
What's the fuss?

91
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:20.042 line:80%
Is this Rama-Rama Graphic?

92
00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:22.167 line:80%
Who are you?

93
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.375 line:80%
I'm Rahul, sir. I came for the job.

94
00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:26.375 line:80%
You understand Tamil?

95
00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:27.958 line:80%
A little bit, sir.

96
00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:29.958 line:80%
Sir, is this Rama-Rama Graphic?

97
00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:31.917 line:80%
Rama-Rama Graphic?

98
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.625 line:80%
They're gone.

99
00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:35.792 line:80%
They're out for lunch?

100
00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:40.042 line:80%
They have gone bust. They had problems
with Customs and Immigration.

101
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:42.167 line:80%
All of them have been arrested.

102
00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:43.667 line:80%
You're lucky.

103
00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:45.542 line:80%
But I'm not.

104
00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:47.667 line:80%
They haven't paid my rent yet.

105
00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:50.708 line:80%
Sir, I don't understand.

106
00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:52.125 line:80%
Why did you say I was lucky?

107
00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:56.250 line:80%
You're not in jail with them.

108
00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:58.250 line:80%
You know what they feed you?

109
00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.125 line:80%
Rotten sewer rats!

110
00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:05.583 line:80%
Dear God, eat rats?

111
00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.458 line:80%
What should I do now?

112
00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.333 line:80%
I don't know what to do, sir.

113
00:07:12.417 --> 00:07:15.208 line:80%
I spent all my savings for this.

114
00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:22.208 line:80%
What can I do?

115
00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:24.667 line:80%
Rahul, have you eaten?

116
00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:27.208 line:80%
Follow me, my son.

117
00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:37.042 line:80%
Sit down.

118
00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:44.167 line:80%
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.250 line:80%
Nice hair.

120
00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:49.000 line:80%
-Rahul.
-Yes, sir.

121
00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:51.000 line:80%
Do you have a work permit?

122
00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:53.208 line:80%
Sir, I'll do anything for you.

123
00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:54.875 line:80%
Anything, sir.

124
00:08:02.542 --> 00:08:05.000 line:80%
Was it delicious, Rahul?

125
00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:08.083 line:80%
It was very delicious, sir.
I love this food so much.

126
00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:10.125 line:80%
I love this
parata
so much.

127
00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:16.958 line:80%
Of course. This is my mother's recipe,
cooked with special ingredients.

128
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.833 line:80%
Everyone loves this
parata.

129
00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:24.917 line:80%
Everyone.

130
00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.542 line:80%
He's our new guy, Rahul.

131
00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:33.792 line:80%
He's replacing Amardip starting today.

132
00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:35.083 line:80%
Feroz.

133
00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.667 line:80%
-Greetings.
-I'm the chef.

134
00:08:39.458 --> 00:08:41.458 line:80%
I'm Arjun, his assistant.

135
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.167 line:80%
-Greetings.
-I'm Vasu.

136
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.292 line:80%
Special ingredient department.

137
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.542 line:80%
For
roti canai.

138
00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:57.250 line:80%
I'm Siti.

139
00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.167 line:80%
The cleaner.

140
00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:52.500 line:80%
Good.

141
00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:12.875 line:80%
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.

142
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.833 line:80%
Your salary for today, son.

143
00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:21.875 line:80%
Rahul, you'll be getting
50 ringgit per day.

144
00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:25.208 line:80%
That leaves 200 ringgit for your salary.

145
00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.458 line:80%
That makes it 1,400 ringgit per month.

146
00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:30.292 line:80%
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

147
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.750 line:80%
I will deduct 400 ringgit
for your accommodation.

148
00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:36.250 line:80%
Okay, sir.

149
00:10:36.333 --> 00:10:40.583 line:80%
And another 400 ringgit
for your work permit.

150
00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:46.292 line:80%
I have to protect you
from the authorities.

151
00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:51.042 line:80%
I'll use 400 ringgit for that matter.

152
00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.875 line:80%
I'll use your salary
to solve the permit issue.

153
00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.042 line:80%
You must understand.

154
00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.375 line:80%
Are you sure you need all of them?

155
00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:04.000 line:80%
Yes, all of it.

156
00:11:04.792 --> 00:11:07.667 line:80%
And your passport too.

157
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.542 line:80%
I have it.

158
00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:11.875 line:80%
A moment, sir.

159
00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:24.125 line:80%
I want my workers to go home
with lots of money. That's my wish.

160
00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:25.833 line:80%
Yes, I know, sir.

161
00:11:26.167 --> 00:11:29.500 line:80%
I want to give all my money to my mother.

162
00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:33.000 line:80%
Very good, I like that quality.

163
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:37.167 line:80%
We must always be nice to our mother.

164
00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:39.833 line:80%
You know.

165
00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:41.208 line:80%
Rahul.

166
00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:46.833 line:80%
When my mother came here from Trici,
she had nothing.

167
00:11:47.542 --> 00:11:51.750 line:80%
If thoroughly plowed,
the yield will be abundant. Understand?

168
00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:53.208 line:80%
Yes, I understand.

169
00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:58.792 line:80%
Always remember.
You're unique just like everyone else.

170
00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:02.750 line:80%
No, I just don't know what to say.

171
00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:05.417 line:80%
I think God sent you to me, sir.

172
00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:07.417 line:80%
You're so kind.

173
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.458 line:80%
I have no words to say.

174
00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:11.417 line:80%
Words mean nothing here, my son.

175
00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:13.792 line:80%
You have to work hard. Understand?

176
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.250 line:80%
Yes, sir.

177
00:12:27.083 --> 00:12:28.458 line:80%
Hey, hurry up!

178
00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:48.875 line:80%
All that up there is the sky, my friend.

179
00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:52.583 line:80%
On the ground, this is our home.

180
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.458 line:80%
Welcome, Rahul.

181
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.417 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

182
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.458 line:80%
You come and go as you please.
Do you think it's your father's hotel?

183
00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:06.958 line:80%
Where are you going?

184
00:13:07.042 --> 00:13:08.833 line:80%
I need to go and buy soap.

185
00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:11.625 line:80%
Soap? Don't you dare lie to me.

186
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.042 line:80%
I smell bad.

187
00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:15.542 line:80%
You smell like a carcass.

188
00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:18.792 line:80%
Before I throw you into the sewer,
you better go.

189
00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:21.667 line:80%
Now! Come back quickly!

190
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.958 line:80%
What's your problem?

191
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.250 line:80%
Hey, brother.

192
00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:38.958 line:80%
Greetings.

193
00:13:43.583 --> 00:13:44.958 line:80%
First thing to learn.

194
00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:49.833 line:80%
Never pick a fight with ugly people
you have nothing to lose.

195
00:13:49.917 --> 00:13:52.125 line:80%
The little one is the boss's nephew.

196
00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:54.833 line:80%
The other fella, Komang, is the boss' dog.

197
00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:59.375 line:80%
You don't want to mess with them.
Especially the Indonesian.

198
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.583 line:80%
All right. Listen here, guys.

199
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.083 line:80%
This is Rahul.

200
00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:10.292 line:80%
-Welcome.
-From Mumbai.

201
00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:11.458 line:80%
Our new guy.

202
00:14:11.542 --> 00:14:14.042 line:80%
Come in.

203
00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:18.917 line:80%
Rahul, over here is your corner.

204
00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:23.958 line:80%
Come, have a seat.

205
00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.417 line:80%
We speak English here

206
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.375 line:80%
so that the dogs outside
cannot understand what we speak.

207
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:39.000 line:80%
Rahul, please don't be shy. Come.

208
00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:46.708 line:80%
Rahul?

209
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.958 line:80%
What's your story?

210
00:14:49.458 --> 00:14:50.958 line:80%
-My story?
-Yes.

211
00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:55.000 line:80%
I was offered a job
as an assistant manager for a company.

212
00:14:55.083 --> 00:14:57.417 line:80%
But suddenly, the company has gone bust.

213
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.708 line:80%
But luckily, I found the boss
and he offered me a job here.

214
00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:11.417 line:80%
Always remember you are unique
just like everyone else.

215
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.292 line:80%
We all have been saved by our own boss.

216
00:15:21.542 --> 00:15:22.542 line:80%
Saved?

217
00:15:23.167 --> 00:15:25.000 line:80%
More like enslaved.

218
00:15:28.125 --> 00:15:30.292 line:80%
They're all lies, Rahul.

219
00:15:31.542 --> 00:15:34.083 line:80%
Every one of us here was offered a job

220
00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:38.125 line:80%
in a company that happened
to close down just before we arrived.

221
00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:40.500 line:80%
Five years ago when I came here,

222
00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:43.833 line:80%
as a teacher in a private Tamil school.

223
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.417 line:80%
IT engineer, scientist,
banker, dancer, singer.

224
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.708 line:80%
We're now in a foreign land

225
00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:56.792 line:80%
Don't you ever fall in love

226
00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:00.042 line:80%
Don't let it spoil our good name

227
00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.042 line:80%
Or we'll lose our future

228
00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:08.333 line:80%
Let it go, my little brother
Our hope is on your shoulder

229
00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:10.042 line:80%
You better stop singing now.

230
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.167 line:80%
It's not me singing. It's them.

231
00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:21.958 line:80%
He got hold of our passports,
so we cannot escape.

232
00:16:22.417 --> 00:16:24.333 line:80%
And that's why we're all here.

233
00:16:25.292 --> 00:16:26.833 line:80%
Peeling potatoes.

234
00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:29.458 line:80%
We are cheap.

235
00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:31.500 line:80%
We live underground.

236
00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:35.417 line:80%
And we're cramped together
in this crowded palace.

237
00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:40.333 line:80%
Like potatoes in a gunnysack.

238
00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.875 line:80%
We're all potatoes here.

239
00:16:46.625 --> 00:16:51.000 line:80%
Even potatoes are worth more than gold
in some ancient civilizations.

240
00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:14.042 line:80%
Living here is like taking a sleeping pill
and laxative all on the same night.

241
00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:27.417 line:80%
Rahul.

242
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.750 line:80%
Do you know what a soap bubble
and virginity have in common?

243
00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:39.000 line:80%
One pop

244
00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:43.708 line:80%
and they're gone.

245
00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:47.917 line:80%
You're never too old
to learn something stupid.

246
00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:54.958 line:80%
A clear conscience is usually
the sign of bad memory, Rahul.

247
00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:57.917 line:80%
Teaching anthropology
at a non-existent college

248
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.875 line:80%
doesn't make you smart overnight.

249
00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:02.583 line:80%
Growing old won't make you wiser either.

250
00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:06.500 line:80%
Especially if you don't have
any teaching experience.

251
00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:11.208 line:80%
Of course, artificial intelligence
is no match for sheer stupidity.

252
00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:12.333 line:80%
Stupid!

253
00:18:14.542 --> 00:18:15.625 line:80%
Lesson number two.

254
00:18:16.167 --> 00:18:18.542 line:80%
Never argue with a fool.

255
00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:20.750 line:80%
He will lower you to his level

256
00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:23.208 line:80%
and then beat you with his experience.

257
00:18:24.167 --> 00:18:26.333 line:80%
Are we talking about you here?

258
00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:28.917 line:80%
No. We're talking about you.

259
00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:33.000 line:80%
I don't want to be indecisive.

260
00:18:33.083 --> 00:18:36.792 line:80%
Whenever these two are fighting,
which side should I take?

261
00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.750 line:80%
But now, I'm not so sure.

262
00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:41.125 line:80%
-We're talking about you here.
-Pardon?

263
00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:42.875 line:80%
Now, we are talking about you.

264
00:19:18.083 --> 00:19:19.417 line:80%
Nice.

265
00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:23.542 line:80%
The food is delicious.

266
00:19:24.292 --> 00:19:27.667 line:80%
Not so nice after 3,000 days.

267
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.833 line:80%
This is what we have
been eating every day without fail.

268
00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:34.833 line:80%
-Really?
-Yes, seriously.

269
00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:37.000 line:80%
We eat it so much

270
00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:41.042 line:80%
until we can't even differentiate
between one fart and another.

271
00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:48.333 line:80%
Some of us try to escape.

272
00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.333 line:80%
But none succeeded.

273
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.500 line:80%
We never heard from them again.

274
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.250 line:80%
No passport, no money, dead meat.

275
00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.625 line:80%
Living in jail by now, you know. Eating…

276
00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:03.792 line:80%
Or dead.

277
00:20:04.458 --> 00:20:07.458 line:80%
Some say they just shoot you,
then pack you home.

278
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.708 line:80%
You know, like the meat they send
to the shop every morning.

279
00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:14.708 line:80%
Maybe that's better than living here.

280
00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:19.042 line:80%
Or eating dead rotten sewer rats in jail.

281
00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:28.458 line:80%
Where have you been?

282
00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:31.083 line:80%
-I took a wrong turn.
-What wrong turn?

283
00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:32.500 line:80%
Are you trying to run away?

284
00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:36.875 line:80%
You all want to die?

285
00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:40.625 line:80%
Hey, brother!

286
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.625 line:80%
Laughing?

287
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.333 line:80%
What?

288
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.542 line:80%
Keep on laughing
and I'll hit your heads with this brick.

289
00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:55.625 line:80%
Keep on laughing and I'll kill you.

290
00:20:55.917 --> 00:20:58.917 line:80%
-What is it?
-I forgive you.

291
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.542 line:80%
You forgive me?

292
00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:03.208 line:80%
If you can't speak right,
you better shut up.

293
00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:05.667 line:80%
Now you can beat him up, come on!

294
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.708 line:80%
No self-respect!

295
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.708 line:80%
Can't even speak right!

296
00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:18.000 line:80%
Eat up or I'll kill all of you.

297
00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:20.083 line:80%
Come eat.

298
00:21:24.292 --> 00:21:26.167 line:80%
Come eat.

299
00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:28.958 line:80%
Here, you can have mine.

300
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.083 line:80%
What's the matter?

301
00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:42.875 line:80%
I hate it, Komang.

302
00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:44.625 line:80%
They laughed at me just now.

303
00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:48.583 line:80%
To them, you're cute and funny.
Nothing wrong with that.

304
00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:52.958 line:80%
Komang, I want power.
I want to be like you.

305
00:21:53.042 --> 00:21:55.000 line:80%
I want everyone to fear me.

306
00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:58.125 line:80%
Gosh. Power can corrupt you.

307
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.583 line:80%
You just need an imagination.

308
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000 line:80%
Idiot!

309
00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:13.042 line:80%
That's not what I meant.

310
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:15.292 line:80%
How are you?

311
00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:18.333 line:80%
Thank you.

312
00:22:19.417 --> 00:22:21.125 line:80%
-How are you?
-Thank you.

313
00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:23.083 line:80%
When you need,

314
00:22:24.542 --> 00:22:26.417 line:80%
say please.

315
00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:30.458 line:80%
It means "please" or "help."

316
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000 line:80%
But if you hear, "Stop!"

317
00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:38.000 line:80%
Or, "Don't run!"

318
00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:40.458 line:80%
You run like hell.

319
00:22:41.917 --> 00:22:43.000 line:80%
Please be quiet.

320
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.958 line:80%
I want to sleep now.

321
00:22:51.208 --> 00:22:52.333 line:80%
Put these in.

322
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.583 line:80%
Now you won't be able to hear the snoring.

323
00:23:00.917 --> 00:23:01.917 line:80%
What?

324
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.458 line:80%
I said you won't be able
to hear the snoring very much.

325
00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:06.958 line:80%
What?

326
00:23:07.042 --> 00:23:08.375 line:80%
I said…

327
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.833 line:80%
I said you won't be able
to hear the snoring very much.

328
00:23:16.875 --> 00:23:18.667 line:80%
Got it. It really helps, sir.

329
00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:24.917 line:80%
-Good night, sir.
-What?

330
00:23:25.708 --> 00:23:27.000 line:80%
I say good night, sir.

331
00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:28.750 line:80%
What?

332
00:23:29.042 --> 00:23:30.250 line:80%
Good night, sir.

333
00:23:31.208 --> 00:23:32.375 line:80%
Never mind, sir.

334
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.708 line:80%
Sir, that cotton…

335
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.042 line:80%
Sir?

336
00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:30.375 line:80%
Forgive me, Mom.

337
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:33.083 line:80%
I'm really sorry.

338
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.875 line:80%
Imagine, in my hand,

339
00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:48.000 line:80%
a 14-inch magnum gun.

340
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.167 line:80%
With a double barrel. Shoot once,
two will go down. I hand it over to you.

341
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.750 line:80%
In your hand, a 14-inch magnum.

342
00:24:57.833 --> 00:25:00.875 line:80%
Now, feel the energy flowing
through your body.

343
00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:02.792 line:80%
How does it feel?

344
00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:04.625 line:80%
Stylish.

345
00:25:04.708 --> 00:25:07.958 line:80%
Like a cowboy warrior.

346
00:25:08.042 --> 00:25:10.750 line:80%
Everyone! One, two, three, four.

347
00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:47.042 line:80%
What's this?

348
00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:50.292 line:80%
Why are we dancing at this hour?
What's wrong with him?

349
00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:52.792 line:80%
They're trying to humiliate us.

350
00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:55.917 line:80%
Hey.

351
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.083 line:80%
What's all the noise?
Shut up and dance. Hurry up!

352
00:25:59.167 --> 00:26:01.250 line:80%
Hey, old man! Move it.

353
00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:05.333 line:80%
I'll kill all of you.

354
00:26:05.417 --> 00:26:06.667 line:80%
Hey, shorty!

355
00:26:07.042 --> 00:26:09.875 line:80%
You think we are slaves? We're not slaves.

356
00:26:10.458 --> 00:26:13.583 line:80%
-How dare you?! You're dead!
-I'm right here.

357
00:26:13.667 --> 00:26:15.000 line:80%
I'm going to get you.

358
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.750 line:80%
Don't fight fire with fire.

359
00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:22.500 line:80%
Remember that
the fire department usually uses water.

360
00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:27.625 line:80%
What?

361
00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:30.875 line:80%
You can't do this to us.

362
00:26:30.958 --> 00:26:33.250 line:80%
Or anything to any one of us.

363
00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:34.500 line:80%
You understand, shorty?

364
00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:38.417 line:80%
This kid is really crazy!

365
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.083 line:80%
Hey, shorty, now what?

366
00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:45.292 line:80%
Hey, brother!

367
00:26:46.875 --> 00:26:48.042 line:80%
Did you hear that?

368
00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:51.708 line:80%
The sound of your coffin is being made.

369
00:26:53.458 --> 00:26:54.667 line:80%
You.

370
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.208 line:80%
Indian. Step aside!

371
00:26:57.292 --> 00:26:58.500 line:80%
Kill me if you must.

372
00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:00.750 line:80%
He's really crazy.

373
00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:07.208 line:80%
Beating you to death
is not part of my job.

374
00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:12.542 line:80%
But I'll not hesitate to kill you

375
00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:16.625 line:80%
like I kill the flies and mosquitoes
that disturb my sleep.

376
00:27:17.792 --> 00:27:19.042 line:80%
Do you understand?

377
00:27:19.875 --> 00:27:21.917 line:80%
Hey, Indian!

378
00:27:23.042 --> 00:27:24.208 line:80%
You listen to this.

379
00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:27.375 line:80%
I'm Indian too.

380
00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:31.583 line:80%
-Me too.
-So?

381
00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:32.750 line:80%
This is crazy.

382
00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:34.708 line:80%
Me too.

383
00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:36.500 line:80%
I'm from Nepal, but just the same.

384
00:27:37.542 --> 00:27:39.917 line:80%
Hey, we're all Indians.

385
00:27:41.292 --> 00:27:42.792 line:80%
We're all Indians!

386
00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:46.333 line:80%
Hey, Indians!

387
00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:50.667 line:80%
This land belongs to the Malays.

388
00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:55.083 line:80%
You ungrateful immigrants!

389
00:27:55.167 --> 00:27:59.958 line:80%
I have dignity
because I'm working for my boss.

390
00:28:00.042 --> 00:28:03.375 line:80%
While you work only for food.

391
00:28:03.458 --> 00:28:04.500 line:80%
You are fools!

392
00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:07.042 line:80%
You're insane!

393
00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:09.375 line:80%
Komang, it's the police!

394
00:28:13.417 --> 00:28:15.250 line:80%
Where's my permit?

395
00:28:15.792 --> 00:28:17.708 line:80%
Where's my permit?

396
00:28:17.792 --> 00:28:18.833 line:80%
Quick!

397
00:28:19.292 --> 00:28:21.333 line:80%
Where's my permit? Run!

398
00:28:25.542 --> 00:28:27.958 line:80%
Police!

399
00:28:28.042 --> 00:28:29.792 line:80%
Run, Rahul, run!

400
00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:41.458 line:80%
It's the police!

401
00:28:42.167 --> 00:28:44.625 line:80%
-Hey!
-Run, Rahul!

402
00:28:47.167 --> 00:28:49.250 line:80%
-Come on, sir!
-Just go!

403
00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:50.750 line:80%
-Come on!
-Go!

404
00:28:55.375 --> 00:28:57.333 line:80%
They can't wait to be caught.

405
00:28:57.417 --> 00:29:00.333 line:80%
Catch them all!

406
00:29:01.167 --> 00:29:02.958 line:80%
Don't let them get away.

407
00:29:07.792 --> 00:29:10.958 line:80%
I like this location.
It's nice. We'll do the night scene here.

408
00:29:11.042 --> 00:29:14.417 line:80%
If possible, I want lots of extras,
men and women.

409
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.333 line:80%
We'll do the running scene,
and when someone falls, many can see.

410
00:29:19.917 --> 00:29:20.958 line:80%
Sorry, sir.

411
00:29:22.333 --> 00:29:26.208 line:80%
Hey, don't run! It's Farid Kamil.
Is there a film being shot?

412
00:29:26.292 --> 00:29:28.583 line:80%
Hey, don't run!

413
00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:32.083 line:80%
If possible, I want the scene to look
exactly like this in my film.

414
00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:33.625 line:80%
It's beautiful. It'll work.

415
00:29:34.417 --> 00:29:35.625 line:80%
Hey!

416
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.125 line:80%
Who's the actor
and who's the director here?

417
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.833 line:80%
This is the problem
when actors want to be the director.

418
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.833 line:80%
Don't run!

419
00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:25.875 line:80%
Hey, don't run!

420
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.875 line:80%
Was he an athlete in school?

421
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.625 line:80%
What a nuisance.

422
00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:40.708 line:80%
Hey, don't run!

423
00:30:41.792 --> 00:30:44.083 line:80%
If you run,
then I'll have to run too, you idiot!

424
00:31:06.792 --> 00:31:09.208 line:80%
What am I going to do?

425
00:31:09.292 --> 00:31:11.625 line:80%
Run, Rahul, run.

426
00:31:22.958 --> 00:31:26.500 line:80%
I caught you!
You caused me so much trouble.

427
00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:30.792 line:80%
I had to chase you
from night until dawn. It's tiring.

428
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.458 line:80%
All of you will be held
at the Immigration Detention Center.

429
00:31:54.542 --> 00:31:55.833 line:80%
Get up and walk in pairs.

430
00:31:55.917 --> 00:31:57.208 line:80%
Get on, hurry up!

431
00:32:00.042 --> 00:32:02.125 line:80%
Chasing that guy almost killed me.

432
00:33:06.708 --> 00:33:08.292 line:80%
Mom, your phone's ringing.

433
00:33:11.958 --> 00:33:13.542 line:80%
Hello, Mom.

434
00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:17.208 line:80%
I tried calling your sister earlier,
but she didn't pick up.

435
00:33:17.292 --> 00:33:18.833 line:80%
How is she?

436
00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:20.625 line:80%
Mom.

437
00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:23.667 line:80%
She's already 35 years old.

438
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.417 line:80%
Don't treat her like a child.

439
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.917 line:80%
She's living alone, with no boyfriend,
and has no kids.

440
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.417 line:80%
If anything happens,
I'm not there to look after her.

441
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.500 line:80%
I'm getting older.
I hope you can look after her.

442
00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:42.042 line:80%
Mom. I already have
my own two kids to take care of.

443
00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:46.958 line:80%
Don't ask me to take care of
another one. Hold on.

444
00:33:48.083 --> 00:33:50.792 line:80%
If she's still not married,
I'll always be worried.

445
00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:53.875 line:80%
No point in having lots of money. Hello?

446
00:33:53.958 --> 00:33:56.125 line:80%
-Hello?
-Did you hear what I said?

447
00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:59.042 line:80%
I'll have to pray very hard for her.

448
00:33:59.125 --> 00:34:03.958 line:80%
If you see her, ask her to call me back.
I have something to discuss with her.

449
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:07.875 line:80%
All right, Mom, I'll let her know.

450
00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:10.750 line:80%
I'm late for work.
I'll call you back later, okay?

451
00:34:10.833 --> 00:34:12.792 line:80%
-All right!
-Bye.

452
00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:19.250 line:80%
Good morning, Kuala Lumpur.

453
00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:21.250 line:80%
What's happening in Kuala Lumpur today?

454
00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:23.125 line:80%
Traffic jam.

455
00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:25.292 line:80%
Avoid Jalan Jelatek.

456
00:34:25.375 --> 00:34:28.167 line:80%
The traffic there is terrible!

457
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.625 line:80%
Hello, where are you? I'm already here.

458
00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:37.000 line:80%
I'm on the way. Give me five minutes.

459
00:34:37.333 --> 00:34:39.917 line:80%
You're always late.
I'm late for my meeting.

460
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.250 line:80%
I'm already at the traffic lights.

461
00:34:54.083 --> 00:34:57.000 line:80%
Mommy, where's Aunty Gienna?

462
00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:04.167 line:80%
I'm hungry.

463
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:12.542 line:80%
Sorry, I tried to come early.
The traffic jam was very bad.

464
00:35:22.208 --> 00:35:23.917 line:80%
Boboy, have you eaten?

465
00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:25.458 line:80%
Not yet.

466
00:35:25.542 --> 00:35:26.750 line:80%
Come, let's eat.

467
00:35:29.583 --> 00:35:30.625 line:80%
Ice-cream?

468
00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:35.208 line:80%
Triple scoops?

469
00:35:36.458 --> 00:35:37.667 line:80%
Okay.

470
00:35:38.083 --> 00:35:39.167 line:80%
Come.

471
00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:52.958 line:80%
Boboy.

472
00:35:53.042 --> 00:35:55.292 line:80%
Let's eat. Why are you standing here?

473
00:35:56.292 --> 00:35:57.333 line:80%
Let's go.

474
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.708 line:80%
I'll buy them for you after we eat.

475
00:36:03.958 --> 00:36:06.250 line:80%
I promise I'll buy them for you
after we eat.

476
00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:35.958 line:80%
Gienna Chan Mei Huee!

477
00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:40.625 line:80%
Hurry up!

478
00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:45.875 line:80%
Gienna, hurry up!

479
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.958 line:80%
Can you give me a ride?

480
00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:01.417 line:80%
Come, quickly.

481
00:37:04.042 --> 00:37:05.917 line:80%
I thought you said you had a meeting.

482
00:37:06.333 --> 00:37:08.167 line:80%
A meeting with this old lady?

483
00:37:09.583 --> 00:37:10.792 line:80%
You've got lots of free time.

484
00:37:11.792 --> 00:37:12.792 line:80%
Get in the car!

485
00:37:14.042 --> 00:37:16.417 line:80%
Since you're free,
I have something for you to do.

486
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.042 line:80%
Granny, you're going to Ampang, right?

487
00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:21.958 line:80%
You can follow her.
Bring her along to Ampang.

488
00:37:22.042 --> 00:37:25.042 line:80%
Why me? She asked you,
so you should drive her.

489
00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:28.333 line:80%
-You're free now. Do some good deeds.
-What?

490
00:37:28.417 --> 00:37:29.667 line:80%
Are you kidding me?

491
00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:32.125 line:80%
Who is she?

492
00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:37.000 line:80%
Why are you always ignoring Mom's calls?

493
00:37:37.875 --> 00:37:38.917 line:80%
I'm busy.

494
00:37:39.208 --> 00:37:41.375 line:80%
Busy doing what? Give me your phone.

495
00:37:41.958 --> 00:37:44.292 line:80%
-Why? Is yours out of battery?
-Just hand it over.

496
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.833 line:80%
See this green button?

497
00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:48.250 line:80%
Press and answer.

498
00:37:48.792 --> 00:37:51.917 line:80%
Don't you know how to use this thing?

499
00:37:57.667 --> 00:38:00.292 line:80%
Joyce. Which part of Ampang?

500
00:38:01.125 --> 00:38:04.875 line:80%
Don't you know how to speak Malay?
Ask her yourself.

501
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.250 line:80%
Where did you come from?

502
00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:26.417 line:80%
Why are you walking alone?

503
00:39:27.792 --> 00:39:30.667 line:80%
I went to my daughter's house
to give a massage.

504
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:34.583 line:80%
They wanted to send me home,
but I don't want to bother them.

505
00:39:34.667 --> 00:39:36.083 line:80%
I can go back on my own.

506
00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:41.208 line:80%
Kuala Lumpur is not that difficult.

507
00:39:41.542 --> 00:39:44.083 line:80%
There are many cars that can send me home.

508
00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:58.750 line:80%
What's your name?

509
00:39:58.833 --> 00:40:00.958 line:80%
-My name is Gi…
-Where do you live?

510
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.917 line:80%
What's your profession?

511
00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:05.042 line:80%
Is your father still alive?

512
00:40:06.333 --> 00:40:07.375 line:80%
Are you married?

513
00:40:10.542 --> 00:40:11.875 line:80%
My name is Gienna.

514
00:40:11.958 --> 00:40:13.458 line:80%
I live in Ampang.

515
00:40:15.167 --> 00:40:16.750 line:80%
My father has passed away.

516
00:40:17.792 --> 00:40:21.208 line:80%
I draw things for a living,
and I'm not married.

517
00:40:22.208 --> 00:40:23.583 line:80%
Please don't ask me why.

518
00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:29.833 line:80%
Why bother to get married

519
00:40:30.458 --> 00:40:33.208 line:80%
-if you're not happy?
-Right.

520
00:40:33.292 --> 00:40:38.208 line:80%
Nowadays, men are lazy.

521
00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.167 line:80%
If they don't have money,
they'll get abusive.

522
00:40:43.958 --> 00:40:46.042 line:80%
I got married at a young age.

523
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.250 line:80%
He was a good man.

524
00:40:49.458 --> 00:40:53.375 line:80%
But I'm the one that beat him.

525
00:40:54.792 --> 00:40:58.333 line:80%
Wow, you're so brave, hitting a man!

526
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.042 line:80%
What's your name?

527
00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:03.917 line:80%
Call me Nek Wok.

528
00:41:04.917 --> 00:41:08.583 line:80%
Nek Wok?
Your name sounds like the telephone line.

529
00:41:08.667 --> 00:41:13.958 line:80%
People nowadays,
how dare they use my name?

530
00:41:15.083 --> 00:41:17.833 line:80%
They have no idea who I am.

531
00:41:18.583 --> 00:41:20.167 line:80%
I'm Banjar people.

532
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.833 line:80%
Banjar people are fierce and strong.

533
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.542 line:80%
There are many types of Banjar.

534
00:41:27.958 --> 00:41:33.000 line:80%
There are
Banjar Laut
,
Banjar Darat
,
Banjar Masin.

535
00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:35.958 line:80%
You're right, Granny.
What you say is true.

536
00:41:36.375 --> 00:41:41.000 line:80%
Recently, my friend's house in Perlis
got hit by a terrible flood.

537
00:41:41.542 --> 00:41:45.333 line:80%
Nowadays, it's hard to tell
which place will be hit by a flood

538
00:41:45.417 --> 00:41:47.583 line:80%
and which place won't be hit.

539
00:41:48.417 --> 00:41:51.333 line:80%
Even Australia has been flooded recently.

540
00:41:55.042 --> 00:41:56.042 line:80%
Granny?

541
00:42:09.625 --> 00:42:10.708 line:80%
What's your name?

542
00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:13.083 line:80%
Where do you live?

543
00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:15.042 line:80%
What's your profession?

544
00:42:15.792 --> 00:42:17.375 line:80%
Is your father still alive?

545
00:42:18.833 --> 00:42:20.000 line:80%
Are you married?

546
00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:24.125 line:80%
Granny, I had already answered
those questions.

547
00:42:25.417 --> 00:42:27.333 line:80%
Asking the same questions again.

548
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.625 line:80%
My name is Gienna.

549
00:42:30.917 --> 00:42:32.875 line:80%
I live in Ampang.

550
00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:36.042 line:80%
My father had passed away.

551
00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:38.875 line:80%
I draw for a living.

552
00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:41.667 line:80%
I'm not married.

553
00:42:43.875 --> 00:42:47.500 line:80%
Granny, what street is your house at?

554
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.833 line:80%
Near the mine, there is Pak Uda's shop.

555
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.542 line:80%
There are no mines here.

556
00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:57.833 line:80%
There's a river, near Bukit Belacan.

557
00:43:02.458 --> 00:43:05.167 line:80%
We're in Kuala Lumpur, right?

558
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:08.333 line:80%
Right, Granny. This is Ampang.

559
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.250 line:80%
Ampang?

560
00:43:13.167 --> 00:43:16.583 line:80%
My house is near a mine,

561
00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:19.958 line:80%
there's Pak Uda's shop in Setapak Jaya.

562
00:43:29.625 --> 00:43:32.458 line:80%
This old lady is so troublesome.

563
00:43:34.083 --> 00:43:37.208 line:80%
First, she said Ampang, now Setapak Jaya.

564
00:43:37.292 --> 00:43:38.792 line:80%
Where is it really?

565
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.292 line:80%
Granny, will you please be clear?

566
00:43:46.375 --> 00:43:49.417 line:80%
Earlier, you said Ampang.
Now, you're saying someplace else.

567
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.333 line:80%
Now, tell me the truth. Where do you live?

568
00:43:56.167 --> 00:43:58.750 line:80%
You're deaf.

569
00:44:01.333 --> 00:44:04.500 line:80%
My house is near a mine.

570
00:44:04.958 --> 00:44:08.250 line:80%
There's Pak Uda's shop in Setapak Jaya.

571
00:44:08.333 --> 00:44:11.125 line:80%
Help me!

572
00:44:12.167 --> 00:44:14.250 line:80%
Poor thing.

573
00:44:15.417 --> 00:44:17.583 line:80%
You had to drive an old lady

574
00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:21.458 line:80%
from day until almost night.

575
00:44:28.625 --> 00:44:30.250 line:80%
Take this and go buy some fuel.

576
00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:33.208 line:80%
Later, when we drive around,
we might run out of fuel.

577
00:44:33.292 --> 00:44:36.375 line:80%
If the car stalls, we'll have to push it.

578
00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:37.917 line:80%
I can't push the car.

579
00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:39.208 line:80%
Go now.

580
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000 line:80%
My fuel tank is still full.

581
00:44:42.667 --> 00:44:45.542 line:80%
It's only a few minutes past twelve.

582
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:55.083 line:80%
Only God can repay your kindness.

583
00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:12.000 line:80%
What's your name?

584
00:45:13.083 --> 00:45:14.333 line:80%
Where do you live?

585
00:45:14.917 --> 00:45:17.375 line:80%
Granny, never mind.
I'll turn around and go to Setapak now.

586
00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:45.042 line:80%
Granny, we're now in Setapak Jaya.

587
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.875 line:80%
Does your house look like this

588
00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:49.583 line:80%
or like that?

589
00:45:51.417 --> 00:45:54.917 line:80%
I don't want to live
in a tall building like that.

590
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000 line:80%
I don't like it.

591
00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:09.500 line:80%
I live in a row of houses.

592
00:46:10.708 --> 00:46:12.708 line:80%
It's made of wood and brick.

593
00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:17.042 line:80%
I planted sugar cane trees by the drain.

594
00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:19.958 line:80%
There was a mine not far from it.

595
00:46:23.792 --> 00:46:29.458 line:80%
Those kids are too brave,
diving into the mine.

596
00:46:29.542 --> 00:46:32.417 line:80%
Granny, did you hear my question?

597
00:46:33.417 --> 00:46:34.667 line:80%
Granny?

598
00:46:37.042 --> 00:46:39.000 line:80%
Why are you smiling?

599
00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:43.375 line:80%
Drop me off at Pak Uda's shop.

600
00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:44.667 line:80%
What?

601
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.500 line:80%
Where's Pak Uda's shop?

602
00:46:46.583 --> 00:46:49.542 line:80%
Is it big or small, and what do they sell?

603
00:46:57.583 --> 00:46:59.417 line:80%
Never mind, I'll ask somebody.

604
00:47:02.917 --> 00:47:03.917 line:80%
You wait here.

605
00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:10.875 line:80%
Your sister up there is going
to make a fuss later.

606
00:47:12.583 --> 00:47:16.625 line:80%
-Yes, miss, can I help you?
-Is there a house here, near a mine?

607
00:47:16.708 --> 00:47:18.542 line:80%
One made of wood and brick?

608
00:47:19.458 --> 00:47:21.042 line:80%
Pak Uda's shop?

609
00:47:21.125 --> 00:47:22.875 line:80%
With sugar cane trees?

610
00:47:22.958 --> 00:47:24.167 line:80%
Hello?

611
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:27.000 line:80%
Miss, there are no houses
like that anymore.

612
00:47:27.083 --> 00:47:28.750 line:80%
All houses are made of bricks now.

613
00:47:29.125 --> 00:47:30.208 line:80%
What about a mine?

614
00:47:30.792 --> 00:47:31.833 line:80%
A mine?

615
00:47:32.958 --> 00:47:36.583 line:80%
You see there, turn left, then straight.
See if you can find the mine.

616
00:47:40.792 --> 00:47:41.792 line:80%
Thank you.

617
00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:58.792 line:80%
I turned left and right,
but I still can't find any mines.

618
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.125 line:80%
Stop honking.

619
00:48:07.125 --> 00:48:08.833 line:80%
If you want to go first, then go.

620
00:48:14.583 --> 00:48:16.583 line:80%
Where are you rushing to? Hell?

621
00:48:25.208 --> 00:48:26.583 line:80%
Poor thing.

622
00:48:28.167 --> 00:48:30.542 line:80%
We still have a long way to go, do we?

623
00:48:41.208 --> 00:48:46.000 line:80%
Hello, may I ask you something?
Is there a mine around here?

624
00:48:46.917 --> 00:48:47.917 line:80%
A mine?

625
00:48:51.083 --> 00:48:52.208 line:80%
I don't know, miss.

626
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.792 line:80%
Hello, can you help me?

627
00:49:01.292 --> 00:49:03.250 line:80%
Is there a mine around here?

628
00:49:04.167 --> 00:49:06.167 line:80%
Any houses made of wood and brick?

629
00:49:08.083 --> 00:49:09.167 line:80%
Pak Uda's shop?

630
00:49:09.583 --> 00:49:10.667 line:80%
Sugar cane trees?

631
00:49:17.667 --> 00:49:19.292 line:80%
What's she talking about?

632
00:49:19.375 --> 00:49:23.625 line:80%
A house made of wood and brick?
What year do you think it is?

633
00:49:23.708 --> 00:49:25.292 line:80%
A mine? Is there a mine?

634
00:49:27.125 --> 00:49:29.042 line:80%
Listen, Auntie. Auntie or Miss?

635
00:49:29.125 --> 00:49:31.292 line:80%
Miss.

636
00:49:31.375 --> 00:49:34.333 line:80%
Miss, let me tell you.

637
00:49:34.417 --> 00:49:36.167 line:80%
The mine has already closed.

638
00:49:36.458 --> 00:49:39.792 line:80%
There is no mine anymore.
It's our hangout place now.

639
00:49:42.292 --> 00:49:44.833 line:80%
Is this the right way?

640
00:49:46.167 --> 00:49:47.375 line:80%
Where is this?

641
00:49:53.542 --> 00:49:57.417 line:80%
You listen. You take this road
and go straight.

642
00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:03.125 line:80%
Just keep going forward
until you find that place.

643
00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:06.167 line:80%
Right?

644
00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:09.250 line:80%
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

645
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.500 line:80%
NO VEHICLES ARE ALLOWED
EXCEPT FOR EMPLOYEES'.

646
00:51:24.417 --> 00:51:25.542 line:80%
Granny.

647
00:51:35.375 --> 00:51:38.917 line:80%
I planted these.

648
00:51:41.833 --> 00:51:43.667 line:80%
Oh, my sugar cane trees.

649
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:54.125 line:80%
These are the sugar canes I planted.
There used to be more.

650
00:51:55.292 --> 00:51:57.333 line:80%
Never mind. Only these are left now.

651
00:51:57.417 --> 00:51:59.375 line:80%
Good. Where's your house?

652
00:52:13.292 --> 00:52:15.083 line:80%
Granny, where's your house?

653
00:52:28.042 --> 00:52:30.167 line:80%
Granny, where's your house?

654
00:52:52.917 --> 00:52:53.917 line:80%
Forget it!

655
00:53:05.708 --> 00:53:07.333 line:80%
Is this for real?

656
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.042 line:80%
Don't move!

657
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:15.833 line:80%
I said don't move!

658
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.333 line:80%
-Joyce!
-
I'll call you back later.

659
00:53:25.417 --> 00:53:26.875 line:80%
You're going to get it from me!

660
00:53:29.208 --> 00:53:32.000 line:80%
The number that you have dialed
cannot be reached.

661
00:53:32.625 --> 00:53:34.125 line:80%
I don't believe this!

662
00:53:35.792 --> 00:53:39.417 line:80%
-What's your name?
-My name is Gienna! I live in Ampang!

663
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.250 line:80%
Will you stop poking me?

664
00:53:41.333 --> 00:53:43.917 line:80%
Now my car has run out of fuel,

665
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.583 line:80%
and I can't be patient anymore!

666
00:53:47.083 --> 00:53:50.000 line:80%
I already told you to buy fuel,
but you refused.

667
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:52.750 line:80%
Her car ran out of fuel.

668
00:54:02.417 --> 00:54:03.917 line:80%
Miss, what's the problem?

669
00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:05.875 line:80%
I ran out of fuel.

670
00:54:07.167 --> 00:54:09.542 line:80%
She ran out of fuel.

671
00:54:09.625 --> 00:54:11.542 line:80%
Want to follow us to the petrol pump?

672
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:12.958 line:80%
No, it's okay.

673
00:54:14.625 --> 00:54:16.292 line:80%
I have to stay with the granny.

674
00:54:17.667 --> 00:54:19.500 line:80%
Can you buy the fuel for me?

675
00:54:22.583 --> 00:54:27.500 line:80%
I don't have any small change.
Just buy RM10 and return the change to me.

676
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.958 line:80%
-I'll keep the change, okay?
-Just buy RM10.

677
00:54:31.042 --> 00:54:32.292 line:80%
Return the change to you?

678
00:54:32.833 --> 00:54:34.625 line:80%
Right. Okay, you wait here.

679
00:54:34.708 --> 00:54:37.250 line:80%
-Be quick.
-Return the change, right?

680
00:55:18.583 --> 00:55:19.583 line:80%
What's the matter?

681
00:55:20.708 --> 00:55:23.708 line:80%
-I ran out of fuel.
-Where's the car? I don't see it.

682
00:55:26.208 --> 00:55:27.625 line:80%
What are you doing out here?

683
00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:33.542 line:80%
-Looking for sugar cane trees.
-Sugar cane trees? Nonsense.

684
00:55:34.042 --> 00:55:35.917 line:80%
Who's this?

685
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.792 line:80%
-You don't look like family.
-I'm just helping her out.

686
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:41.083 line:80%
Okay.

687
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:43.417 line:80%
So, how can I help?

688
00:55:43.917 --> 00:55:46.417 line:80%
-I had asked someone to buy…
-What's your name?

689
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:47.583 line:80%
My name…

690
00:55:47.667 --> 00:55:48.750 line:80%
Where do you live?

691
00:55:49.542 --> 00:55:50.958 line:80%
What's your profession?

692
00:55:51.833 --> 00:55:53.458 line:80%
Is your father still alive?

693
00:55:54.083 --> 00:55:55.333 line:80%
Are you married?

694
00:57:05.417 --> 00:57:08.083 line:80%
Grandma! Whose car is this?

695
00:57:08.708 --> 00:57:09.833 line:80%
It's my car.

696
00:57:09.917 --> 00:57:11.792 line:80%
How can you afford this?

697
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.125 line:80%
I've got money.

698
00:57:14.542 --> 00:57:17.458 line:80%
You're riding in a car
with a Chinese person.

699
00:57:18.292 --> 00:57:19.417 line:80%
Who's the Chinese person?

700
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:27.667 line:80%
Does Kak Peah know you're in this car?

701
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.875 line:80%
It's dangerous to ride
in a stranger's car.

702
00:57:35.375 --> 00:57:37.417 line:80%
Boy, do you know her?

703
00:57:38.167 --> 00:57:39.500 line:80%
I do. This is Nek Wok.

704
00:57:39.958 --> 00:57:43.417 line:80%
Thank God. Do you know where she lives?

705
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.292 line:80%
-I know.
-Can you show me?

706
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:48.542 line:80%
Boy, please show me where she lives.

707
00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:58.333 line:80%
-Are you coming or not?
-Yes, I'm coming.

708
00:58:00.208 --> 00:58:01.208 line:80%
Thank you!

709
00:58:16.042 --> 00:58:20.958 line:80%
Granny, are you sure
you don't live in the flat?

710
00:58:21.417 --> 00:58:24.000 line:80%
Why is the boy taking us here?

711
00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:26.417 line:80%
Don't you understand?

712
00:58:26.958 --> 00:58:29.458 line:80%
I don't like living in a flat.

713
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.917 line:80%
I'm too old to climb the stairs.

714
00:58:33.125 --> 00:58:37.875 line:80%
When the lift isn't working,
I can't go down.

715
00:58:38.583 --> 00:58:40.917 line:80%
I can only watch from above.

716
00:58:41.625 --> 00:58:47.042 line:80%
Why does the government like
to build high-rise homes?

717
00:58:49.708 --> 00:58:52.833 line:80%
One day, if I win the election,

718
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:59.333 line:80%
I'll build low-rise houses,
arranged in long rows.

719
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:04.125 line:80%
It'd be easier for old people like me
to go in and out.

720
00:59:06.292 --> 00:59:09.792 line:80%
It's better to live in a house like this.

721
00:59:09.875 --> 00:59:11.000 line:80%
No flooding.

722
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.375 line:80%
How many are you taking?

723
00:59:18.458 --> 00:59:22.167 line:80%
-Two.
-RM3.60, 40 cents. RM4.

724
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:24.792 line:80%
RM4. This one's RM1, right?

725
00:59:24.875 --> 00:59:28.000 line:80%
-Make it five ringgit.
-When are you going to pay?

726
00:59:28.083 --> 00:59:30.708 line:80%
Give me a break.
Are you trying to steal from me?

727
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000 line:80%
You're too much, you know.

728
00:59:45.208 --> 00:59:47.375 line:80%
Hey, Amin. Where's my rice?

729
00:59:47.958 --> 00:59:49.500 line:80%
I'm taking it to you now!

730
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.542 line:80%
Faster. I've waited too long for you.

731
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.208 line:80%
Mom, you said you were staying with Yong?

732
01:00:06.583 --> 01:00:07.833 line:80%
Why are you back?

733
01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.042 line:80%
She's taking a shower.
I don't want to wait.

734
01:00:11.125 --> 01:00:13.667 line:80%
Why can't you wait for her?

735
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.333 line:80%
Why did you come back?

736
01:00:16.792 --> 01:00:17.875 line:80%
Oh, God.

737
01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.708 line:80%
Mom! Don't!

738
01:00:20.792 --> 01:00:22.917 line:80%
Your hands are dirty. Mom, don't.

739
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000 line:80%
You've been drinking too much syrup.
Here, take these sweets.

740
01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:29.833 line:80%
Here's one for you. Take these sweets.

741
01:00:32.292 --> 01:00:35.750 line:80%
Mom, does Yong know
that you came back here?

742
01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:37.500 line:80%
She can go to hell!

743
01:00:38.917 --> 01:00:40.083 line:80%
Mom.

744
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:49.833 line:80%
Sixtieth victim.

745
01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.292 line:80%
Anything to ask?

746
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.292 line:80%
What's your name?

747
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.083 line:80%
Where do you live?

748
01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:13.625 line:80%
What's your profession?

749
01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:17.792 line:80%
Is your father still alive?

750
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.792 line:80%
Are you married?

751
01:01:56.792 --> 01:01:59.875 line:80%
-Mom, how are you?
-
I'm fine.

752
01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:02.833 line:80%
I called many times
but you didn't pick up.

753
01:02:02.917 --> 01:02:07.167 line:80%
I just wanted to let you know,
Uncle Onn's son has returned from Canada.

754
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.000 line:80%
He's a very nice guy.

755
01:02:09.083 --> 01:02:13.042 line:80%
I'll show you his photo when you're back.
Don't be so picky.

756
01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:14.833 line:80%
-Dang it!
-What?

757
01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:19.000 line:80%
Sorry, Mom, I'm not cursing you.
It's the car in front of me.

758
01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:22.833 line:80%
Watch your mouth.
No wonder you're still single.

759
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.250 line:80%
Listen to your mother
and stop being picky.

760
01:02:27.542 --> 01:02:29.750 line:80%
You're not young anymore.

761
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:35.500 line:80%
Hey! Cover him!

762
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.000 line:80%
Cover him!

763
01:02:43.167 --> 01:02:45.167 line:80%
Am I not a man if I

764
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.958 line:80%
can't play football?

765
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.042 line:80%
Am I not a man

766
01:02:58.125 --> 01:03:01.750 line:80%
if I'm not good with tools?

767
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:13.417 line:80%
Hafid!

768
01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:34.917 line:80%
Am I not a man if I…

769
01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:39.042 line:80%
don't like rock music?

770
01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.917 line:80%
Am I not a man if I

771
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:53.792 line:80%
don't like fighting?

772
01:04:07.833 --> 01:04:09.500 line:80%
Am I not a man if I…

773
01:04:12.292 --> 01:04:13.292 line:80%
am single?

774
01:04:16.583 --> 01:04:17.625 line:80%
Fid?

775
01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:19.458 line:80%
Fid!

776
01:04:21.792 --> 01:04:22.792 line:80%
Are you okay?

777
01:04:23.875 --> 01:04:24.875 line:80%
Let's sit first.

778
01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:28.708 line:80%
Okay. So, after this, do you have time?

779
01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:31.375 line:80%
-Yes.
-Okay, if you have time, we…

780
01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:32.667 line:80%
What's your problem?

781
01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:35.042 line:80%
I'm fine.

782
01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.083 line:80%
Are you looking at my girl?

783
01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:40.375 line:80%
Oh, okay. Rahimah, meet Hafid.

784
01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:41.625 line:80%
Hafid, this is Rahimah.

785
01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:45.208 line:80%
New girlfriend?

786
01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.208 line:80%
Of course. I'm not like you, bro.

787
01:04:48.792 --> 01:04:51.208 line:80%
This guy has a problem
finding a girlfriend.

788
01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:53.583 line:80%
If you have… Where are you going?

789
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.750 line:80%
Find a girlfriend.

790
01:06:58.667 --> 01:06:59.667 line:80%
Hey, you.

791
01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:02.667 line:80%
Me?

792
01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:06.208 line:80%
I need to go home.

793
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.250 line:80%
Will you sit for a while?

794
01:07:13.667 --> 01:07:15.958 line:80%
I'm in a hurry. What's the matter?

795
01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:18.208 line:80%
What?

796
01:07:19.708 --> 01:07:21.125 line:80%
Why'd you call me?

797
01:07:22.333 --> 01:07:23.417 line:80%
No reason.

798
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.083 line:80%
I want you to accompany me for a while.

799
01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:28.833 line:80%
I'm feeling down.

800
01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:33.250 line:80%
My name is Hayy.

801
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.750 line:80%
Siti Nor Hayy.

802
01:07:37.458 --> 01:07:41.083 line:80%
-Are you trying to fool me?
-I'm not lying. Wait.

803
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.833 line:80%
You don't believe me? Here, look.

804
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:46.375 line:80%
My IC.

805
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.208 line:80%
You can see my address too.

806
01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:53.625 line:80%
Even if you're telling the truth,
what do you want me to do?

807
01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:55.958 line:80%
Nothing.

808
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.708 line:80%
I just want you
to keep me company for a while.

809
01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:03.042 line:80%
-But I don't know you.
-What's your name?

810
01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:06.708 line:80%
Hafid.

811
01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:10.625 line:80%
Right.

812
01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:13.208 line:80%
I noticed you earlier.

813
01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:15.750 line:80%
At the LRT station, right?

814
01:08:18.958 --> 01:08:21.667 line:80%
Really? But I didn't remember
seeing you there.

815
01:08:22.833 --> 01:08:24.500 line:80%
Of course you didn't notice me.

816
01:08:25.417 --> 01:08:26.833 line:80%
Too busy checking out other girls.

817
01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:33.750 line:80%
What are you doing here?

818
01:08:40.792 --> 01:08:46.042 line:80%
I just caught my boyfriend cheating on me
with another girl.

819
01:08:57.917 --> 01:08:59.417 line:80%
I cried,

820
01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:02.583 line:80%
and I missed the last train.

821
01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:04.708 line:80%
I didn't realize
it was already past midnight.

822
01:09:05.667 --> 01:09:07.250 line:80%
Why don't you take a taxi?

823
01:09:07.625 --> 01:09:08.917 line:80%
As if I have money.

824
01:09:11.958 --> 01:09:13.000 line:80%
Come over here.

825
01:09:21.542 --> 01:09:22.542 line:80%
Are you hungry?

826
01:09:24.083 --> 01:09:25.083 line:80%
I'm hungry.

827
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:29.583 line:80%
Why don't you come with me
to the stall over there?

828
01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:32.917 line:80%
The food is really good. Let's go.

829
01:09:35.583 --> 01:09:36.625 line:80%
-Over there?
-Yes.

830
01:09:37.292 --> 01:09:38.667 line:80%
-Just for a while?
-Yes.

831
01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:42.583 line:80%
Okay, let's go.

832
01:09:44.583 --> 01:09:45.583 line:80%
Go on.

833
01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:48.125 line:80%
You go first, or you'll run away from me.

834
01:09:58.083 --> 01:09:59.625 line:80%
It's over there, let's go.

835
01:10:07.792 --> 01:10:09.500 line:80%
I didn't know there was a park.

836
01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.833 line:80%
If you don't explore, how do you know?

837
01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:14.250 line:80%
It's a little creepy.

838
01:10:16.417 --> 01:10:17.417 line:80%
Why?

839
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:18.958 line:80%
Beautiful, isn't it?

840
01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:23.042 line:80%
Don't worry, there are no ghosts here.

841
01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:26.833 line:80%
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

842
01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.042 line:80%
It's not that.

843
01:10:32.542 --> 01:10:33.917 line:80%
Do you come here often?

844
01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:36.417 line:80%
Sometimes.

845
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.167 line:80%
When I miss the train.

846
01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:44.875 line:80%
-Are you still studying?
-Huh?

847
01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:46.042 line:80%
Still studying?

848
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:48.542 line:80%
-Yes.
-What are you studying?

849
01:10:49.292 --> 01:10:50.333 line:80%
Interior design.

850
01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:55.083 line:80%
-You must be good at drawing, right?
-A little bit.

851
01:10:56.958 --> 01:10:58.000 line:80%
What about you?

852
01:10:58.333 --> 01:11:00.458 line:80%
-What?
-Are you studying?

853
01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:02.375 line:80%
Working?

854
01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:04.208 line:80%
Also not working?

855
01:11:06.042 --> 01:11:08.500 line:80%
So, how did you spend your day?

856
01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:10.333 line:80%
Just living life.

857
01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:13.458 line:80%
What? I don't understand.

858
01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:18.083 line:80%
Since when did people need
to do something for a living?

859
01:11:18.667 --> 01:11:19.708 line:80%
Am I right?

860
01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:24.708 line:80%
There. Do you see that? The food stall.

861
01:11:25.208 --> 01:11:26.250 line:80%
Let's go.

862
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:35.792 line:80%
I'm sorry.

863
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:40.750 line:80%
This way.

864
01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:47.750 line:80%
Hi, Uncle.

865
01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:55.500 line:80%
Come. I'll feed you.

866
01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:58.667 line:80%
-Just eat it.
-Okay.

867
01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:02.625 line:80%
It's hot.

868
01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:10.167 line:80%
Are you leaving?

869
01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:14.042 line:80%
Uncle, can you pack it up?

870
01:12:21.667 --> 01:12:23.375 line:80%
Thank you. How much is it?

871
01:12:23.792 --> 01:12:25.667 line:80%
-RM3.50.
-RM3.50.

872
01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:28.542 line:80%
Thank you.

873
01:12:29.167 --> 01:12:30.833 line:80%
I'll take one mineral water.

874
01:12:30.917 --> 01:12:33.125 line:80%
Keep the change, Uncle. Thank you.

875
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.042 line:80%
Are you from KL?

876
01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:45.833 line:80%
Are you a local?

877
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.917 line:80%
No. I'm from Behor Gonchar.

878
01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.000 line:80%
-What?
-Behor Gonchar.

879
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.125 line:80%
What, you don't believe me?

880
01:12:57.333 --> 01:12:59.208 line:80%
No. I thought you were a local.

881
01:13:01.542 --> 01:13:03.292 line:80%
I've lived here for quite a while.

882
01:13:03.958 --> 01:13:06.667 line:80%
It's been three years, but…

883
01:13:08.792 --> 01:13:09.833 line:80%
not that long.

884
01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:17.083 line:80%
I want to save enough money.
Then I'll leave.

885
01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:18.875 line:80%
And go where?

886
01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:23.458 line:80%
I want to go backpacking.

887
01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:27.583 line:80%
Maybe I'll start
with Thailand, Cambodia, Laos.

888
01:13:28.208 --> 01:13:32.292 line:80%
Then Vietnam, China, and Russia.

889
01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.417 line:80%
Who knows? I'll just go.

890
01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:39.208 line:80%
Who'll go with you?

891
01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:42.583 line:80%
Just myself.

892
01:13:45.042 --> 01:13:46.125 line:80%
Aren't you afraid?

893
01:13:47.042 --> 01:13:48.083 line:80%
Afraid of what?

894
01:13:48.167 --> 01:13:52.500 line:80%
-Well, isn't it dangerous to go alone?
-So, you've been there yourself?

895
01:13:53.667 --> 01:13:54.708 line:80%
No.

896
01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:58.708 line:80%
If you've never been there,
how do you know it's dangerous?

897
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.333 line:80%
-But you're a girl.
-What do you mean?

898
01:14:01.417 --> 01:14:02.917 line:80%
It's different if you're a man.

899
01:14:03.917 --> 01:14:04.917 line:80%
Oh my God!

900
01:14:10.417 --> 01:14:11.458 line:80%
Hello.

901
01:14:11.792 --> 01:14:12.833 line:80%
Hello.

902
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:14.292 line:80%
How are you?

903
01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:15.375 line:80%
Good morning.

904
01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:24.167 line:80%
You're late!

905
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:28.042 line:80%
You know, earlier,
Alfie bought us all drinks.

906
01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:30.833 line:80%
I'm so drunk!

907
01:14:30.917 --> 01:14:33.500 line:80%
Yes, I know you're drunk.

908
01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:39.500 line:80%
I can't hear you. Sorry, I'm late.
I had something to do.

909
01:14:39.583 --> 01:14:41.417 line:80%
Girl, why don't we get up?

910
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.458 line:80%
It's not proper to be like this.

911
01:14:44.208 --> 01:14:46.125 line:80%
Please get up.

912
01:14:46.208 --> 01:14:48.958 line:80%
Can you help me? I'm not strong enough.

913
01:14:50.042 --> 01:14:51.042 line:80%
Please.

914
01:14:51.833 --> 01:14:54.917 line:80%
You take her left hand. Pull her up.

915
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.375 line:80%
It's not proper like this, girl. Get up.

916
01:14:57.458 --> 01:14:59.750 line:80%
-Come on, get up!
-Wait, hold on!

917
01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:07.083 line:80%
Okay. Get up, please. Like this.

918
01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:09.000 line:80%
Come on girl, get up.

919
01:15:11.958 --> 01:15:15.250 line:80%
Okay.

920
01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:20.917 line:80%
Girl, get up! Just sit over here.

921
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.542 line:80%
On the count of three, go!

922
01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.958 line:80%
Okay, hold on!

923
01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.292 line:80%
Okay.

924
01:15:32.917 --> 01:15:35.292 line:80%
Don't be like that.

925
01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:36.958 line:80%
Don't be like that.

926
01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:38.083 line:80%
Gosh.

927
01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:49.167 line:80%
It's hot!

928
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:59.292 line:80%
Don't you want to go home?

929
01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:02.000 line:80%
I don't want to.

930
01:16:02.083 --> 01:16:04.000 line:80%
All your friends have gone home.

931
01:16:04.083 --> 01:16:08.083 line:80%
It's only you who wants to party.
It's not proper. Just go home.

932
01:16:08.167 --> 01:16:09.167 line:80%
Where's my bag?

933
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.125 line:80%
-Where's her bag?
-Where's my bag?

934
01:16:11.208 --> 01:16:15.542 line:80%
Mia took it with her. It's okay.

935
01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:17.250 line:80%
Let's go home, please.

936
01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:18.625 line:80%
I'll get you a taxi.

937
01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:21.625 line:80%
-I don't want to.
-Do you remember your address?

938
01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:27.667 line:80%
Kota Damansara, D'Rimba Apartment.

939
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.208 line:80%
D'Rimba Apartment.

940
01:16:29.542 --> 01:16:32.042 line:80%
I'll get a taxi, and you'll go home, okay?

941
01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:33.958 line:80%
You remember, D'Rimba, right?

942
01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:36.000 line:80%
Wait, just sit there.

943
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.833 line:80%
Your new boyfriend is quite handsome.

944
01:16:48.917 --> 01:16:51.833 line:80%
I know. I ran into him at KLCC earlier.

945
01:16:54.792 --> 01:16:55.792 line:80%
Hi.

946
01:16:56.667 --> 01:16:58.333 line:80%
I'm Sherry.

947
01:16:58.417 --> 01:17:00.458 line:80%
Do you want to come home with me?

948
01:17:00.542 --> 01:17:01.750 line:80%
The taxi is here.

949
01:17:01.833 --> 01:17:04.125 line:80%
You've got some nerves,

950
01:17:04.792 --> 01:17:08.375 line:80%
trying to steal my boyfriend.

951
01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:10.083 line:80%
You're so bad.

952
01:17:10.458 --> 01:17:11.583 line:80%
Enough. Let's go.

953
01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:13.833 line:80%
-Her shoes?
-Get up. I'll get it later.

954
01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:16.292 line:80%
On the count of three, go! Hold on to me.

955
01:17:17.542 --> 01:17:20.792 line:80%
Okay, let's go. Where are we heading?

957
01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:27.042 line:80%
Okay, get in.

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:28.875 line:80%
Oh my God.

959
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.542 line:80%
Be careful.

960
01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:33.542 line:80%
Sit here, that's right. Clever.

961
01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:38.917 line:80%
Sir, D'Rimba Apartment, Kota Damansara.

962
01:17:39.458 --> 01:17:40.625 line:80%
Thank you.

963
01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:46.208 line:80%
-I love you, baby.
-He's my baby. Don't get it wrong.

964
01:17:46.292 --> 01:17:47.875 line:80%
Be careful, girl.

965
01:17:47.958 --> 01:17:50.250 line:80%
Get your feet in.

966
01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:51.833 line:80%
Okay, sir, thank you.

967
01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:00.208 line:80%
Who was that?

968
01:18:01.542 --> 01:18:03.583 line:80%
-I don't know.
-You don't know her?

969
01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:05.375 line:80%
No.

970
01:18:08.542 --> 01:18:10.625 line:80%
-You're weird.
-You're even weirder.

971
01:18:10.708 --> 01:18:11.875 line:80%
I'm weird?

972
01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:16.958 line:80%
Of course. That girl wanted you so bad,
but you ignored her.

973
01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:20.583 line:80%
I don't need a girl like that.

974
01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:23.208 line:80%
A girl like what?
It's not nice to say that.

975
01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:25.125 line:80%
You don't even know her.

976
01:18:26.083 --> 01:18:27.333 line:80%
You don't know her either.

977
01:18:28.125 --> 01:18:31.958 line:80%
I only want good girls.

978
01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:34.125 line:80%
You only want good girls?

979
01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:38.125 line:80%
You mean, you're so great
that you deserve only decent girls?

980
01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:40.792 line:80%
I don't get drunk like that.

981
01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:42.583 line:80%
I don't party.

982
01:18:42.958 --> 01:18:43.958 line:80%
I don't smoke.

983
01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:49.000 line:80%
You don't party, drink, or smoke like her,

984
01:18:49.083 --> 01:18:52.417 line:80%
so you think you're perfect, don't you?

985
01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.625 line:80%
Huh?

986
01:18:54.708 --> 01:18:57.292 line:80%
That's not what I meant.

987
01:18:57.375 --> 01:19:00.958 line:80%
I'm not as bad as that girl.

988
01:19:01.667 --> 01:19:03.208 line:80%
Bad?

989
01:19:04.083 --> 01:19:07.042 line:80%
You don't even know her,
and you're saying she's bad?

990
01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:11.417 line:80%
Oh my God. I should've asked
for that taxi's phone number.

991
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.250 line:80%
-Just leave it be.
-What if something happens?

992
01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:15.375 line:80%
She'll be fine.

993
01:19:16.625 --> 01:19:18.042 line:80%
My goodness.

994
01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:20.167 line:80%
Hey, Nurul!

995
01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:27.208 line:80%
Nurul, hey!

996
01:19:30.583 --> 01:19:33.750 line:80%
How are you? Come and have a seat.

997
01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:36.750 line:80%
Why is it so quiet?

998
01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:39.917 line:80%
-Where are your friends?
-They've got customers.

999
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.875 line:80%
-I'm the only one left without a customer.
-Oh, you poor thing.

1000
01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:49.167 line:80%
Here, I brought you a customer.
No, he's just a friend.

1001
01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:53.625 line:80%
Nurul Atikah binti Abdul Rahman.

1002
01:19:54.917 --> 01:19:56.167 line:80%
-Hafid.
-Enough.

1003
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.250 line:80%
-Nurul…
-What?

1004
01:20:01.625 --> 01:20:04.750 line:80%
I want to ask you something,
but please don't get mad.

1005
01:20:06.667 --> 01:20:07.708 line:80%
What?

1006
01:20:08.667 --> 01:20:10.167 line:80%
Nothing, I just thought,

1007
01:20:10.792 --> 01:20:13.792 line:80%
it's time for you to change your wig.

1008
01:20:15.333 --> 01:20:16.542 line:80%
Are you serious?

1009
01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:18.583 line:80%
-I am.
-It's good enough already.

1010
01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:20.417 line:80%
I'm not saying it's not good.

1011
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.833 line:80%
The thing is,
you have to go with the times.

1012
01:20:22.917 --> 01:20:24.208 line:80%
Your look's outdated.

1013
01:20:24.292 --> 01:20:26.167 line:80%
-You're a girl, you don't know.
-Then?

1014
01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.083 line:80%
Hey, what do you think?

1015
01:20:28.167 --> 01:20:29.292 line:80%
Does she look fine?

1016
01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:33.625 line:80%
-Okay. No.
-No. Okay or not?

1017
01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:36.083 line:80%
-Which one is it?
-Okay or not?

1018
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:39.667 line:80%
-Not okay.
-Even he agrees with me. You think?

1019
01:20:40.542 --> 01:20:42.167 line:80%
You need to change it.

1020
01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:45.542 line:80%
Why don't we go together
and get a new one?

1021
01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:49.083 line:80%
Maybe something glamorous
that looks like Lady Gaga.

1022
01:20:49.167 --> 01:20:51.750 line:80%
You'll have more customers.
What do you say?

1023
01:20:53.667 --> 01:20:56.875 line:80%
Promise you'll come with me.
I don't know much about fashion.

1024
01:20:56.958 --> 01:20:59.417 line:80%
All right, but right now I have to leave.

1025
01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.750 line:80%
How about next week?

1026
01:21:02.042 --> 01:21:03.125 line:80%
Call me next week.

1027
01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:05.000 line:80%
-Yes.
-I'll call you if you don't.

1028
01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:06.333 line:80%
-Okay.
-You promise?

1029
01:21:06.417 --> 01:21:07.458 line:80%
I promise.

1030
01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:08.833 line:80%
Kiss me?

1031
01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:14.167 line:80%
-Take care of yourself.
-You too.

1032
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:16.708 line:80%
Don't worry, I have a bodyguard with me.

1033
01:21:16.792 --> 01:21:17.833 line:80%
Bye.

1034
01:21:39.375 --> 01:21:40.417 line:80%
Who was that?

1035
01:21:41.583 --> 01:21:42.625 line:80%
A friend.

1036
01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:45.083 line:80%
What's his job?

1037
01:21:45.542 --> 01:21:46.583 line:80%
He sells wigs.

1038
01:21:47.542 --> 01:21:49.833 line:80%
-Really?
-Yes.

1039
01:21:54.292 --> 01:21:55.875 line:80%
Can we sit for a while?

1040
01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:57.333 line:80%
I'm tired.

1041
01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:02.625 line:80%
He sells wigs.

1042
01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:08.167 line:80%
Maybe one day, if you need a wig,
let me know and we'll go buy one.

1043
01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:09.958 line:80%
All right?

1044
01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:13.375 line:80%
Do you think I'm crazy enough
to wear a wig?

1045
01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:17.875 line:80%
I didn't say you have to wear it.
What I'm saying is, just buy one.

1046
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:22.500 line:80%
Who knows, when you have a girlfriend,
you can give it to her, right?

1047
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.875 line:80%
Actually, I never had a girlfriend.

1048
01:22:34.333 --> 01:22:35.333 line:80%
I know.

1049
01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:37.583 line:80%
How do you know?

1050
01:22:38.292 --> 01:22:39.375 line:80%
I just know.

1051
01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:43.208 line:80%
But…

1052
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:47.917 line:80%
But I think I'm actually afraid
to have a girlfriend.

1053
01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:50.167 line:80%
What are you afraid of?

1054
01:22:51.708 --> 01:22:53.750 line:80%
I won't be able to control myself.

1055
01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:56.125 line:80%
From what?

1056
01:22:57.792 --> 01:22:58.833 line:80%
Lust.

1057
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.042 line:80%
Seriously?

1058
01:23:06.125 --> 01:23:08.042 line:80%
-What's so funny?
-No, I'm sorry.

1059
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.000 line:80%
Nothing. The thing is…

1060
01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:12.875 line:80%
The thing is,

1061
01:23:13.458 --> 01:23:15.792 line:80%
I've never met a man like this.

1062
01:23:17.083 --> 01:23:18.208 line:80%
Like you.

1063
01:23:18.292 --> 01:23:21.917 line:80%
You get it? A man who's afraid
to have a girlfriend

1064
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.458 line:80%
because he's worried
that he won't be able to control his lust.

1065
01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:27.917 line:80%
A man like that doesn't exist anymore.

1066
01:23:29.417 --> 01:23:31.417 line:80%
-Me?
-Of course. You're the only one.

1067
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:35.542 line:80%
But now, do you get me?
If some guy takes me to the movies,

1068
01:23:35.625 --> 01:23:39.792 line:80%
even before the movie's finished,
he'd ask me to sleep with him.

1069
01:23:41.792 --> 01:23:44.250 line:80%
But I do want to actually.

1070
01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:45.333 line:80%
Sleep with me?

1071
01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:51.583 line:80%
No. When I saw my friends,
with their girlfriends,

1072
01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:56.917 line:80%
dating, watching movies together,
holding hands…

1073
01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:59.000 line:80%
Wonderful, isn't it?

1074
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:04.167 line:80%
Don't worry about it.

1075
01:24:05.292 --> 01:24:07.000 line:80%
You'll find the one someday.

1076
01:24:07.833 --> 01:24:11.125 line:80%
I'm pretty sure,
if I can actually meet someone like you,

1077
01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:14.458 line:80%
who's so afraid
of losing control of himself,

1078
01:24:14.542 --> 01:24:17.250 line:80%
I'm sure you'll meet a girl
who will appreciate you.

1079
01:24:17.333 --> 01:24:20.167 line:80%
I'm sure you'll find your left rib.

1080
01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:22.917 line:80%
-What?
-Your rib.

1081
01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:25.917 line:80%
Don't you study religion?

1082
01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:29.875 line:80%
Don't you know,
women are created from men's left ribs.

1083
01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:31.667 line:80%
That's why men aren't complete.

1084
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:35.750 line:80%
No matter how great,
tough, strong, or handsome you are,

1085
01:24:35.833 --> 01:24:37.167 line:80%
you aren't complete.

1086
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.292 line:80%
You need us, women, to complete you.

1087
01:24:42.167 --> 01:24:43.208 line:80%
Do you get it?

1088
01:24:43.292 --> 01:24:44.375 line:80%
Yes.

1089
01:24:45.417 --> 01:24:48.208 line:80%
You'll find her someday.
Don't worry too much.

1090
01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:53.375 line:80%
But you have to look for her.
If you don't, how will you find her?

1091
01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:55.667 line:80%
Okay, let's go.

1092
01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:15.375 line:80%
Mr. Clown!

1093
01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:25.208 line:80%
Who's this for?

1094
01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:49.292 line:80%
You want a hug too?

1095
01:25:50.917 --> 01:25:52.458 line:80%
I can't reach you.

1096
01:25:53.792 --> 01:25:54.917 line:80%
Come, over there.

1097
01:25:56.208 --> 01:25:57.375 line:80%
Help me out, please.

1098
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.875 line:80%
Now you can.

1099
01:26:47.458 --> 01:26:48.500 line:80%
Thank you.

1100
01:26:49.417 --> 01:26:50.542 line:80%
We're leaving now.

1101
01:26:51.833 --> 01:26:53.750 line:80%
We're leaving too.

1102
01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:56.417 line:80%
Okay, take care. Bye.

1103
01:26:59.333 --> 01:27:00.542 line:80%
-Bye!
-Bye!

1104
01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:15.083 line:80%
-Cute, isn't it?
-It is.

1105
01:27:15.167 --> 01:27:17.167 line:80%
They like to give me cute things.

1106
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:19.167 line:80%
-Are they your friends too?
-Yes.

1107
01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:23.625 line:80%
-It must be nice, to have many friends.
-Of course.

1108
01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:26.125 line:80%
You're too picky.

1109
01:27:29.167 --> 01:27:31.250 line:80%
-Where are you heading?
-Over there.

1110
01:27:31.333 --> 01:27:34.917 line:80%
I'm heading here.
Thank you for keeping me company.

1111
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.750 line:80%
-You're welcome.
-Bye.

1112
01:28:29.292 --> 01:28:30.292 line:80%
Thank you.

1113
01:28:33.167 --> 01:28:34.750 line:80%
-For what?
-For tonight.

1114
01:28:37.375 --> 01:28:38.500 line:80%
You're so weird.

1115
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:43.792 line:80%
Weird is fun.

1116
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:55.083 line:80%
Can I have your phone number?

1117
01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:24.917 line:80%
012…

1118
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.042 line:80%
What?

1119
01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:34.292 line:80%
Excuse me.

1120
01:30:36.833 --> 01:30:38.042 line:80%
I think you dropped this.

1121
01:30:45.583 --> 01:30:47.208 line:80%
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1122
01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:50.208 line:80%
My name is Hafid.

1123
01:30:51.333 --> 01:30:53.375 line:80%
Hi, I'm Nur. Nice to meet you.
