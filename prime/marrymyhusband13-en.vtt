6 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

3
00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:22.041 line:80%
You look better in person.

4
00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:25.836 line:80%
Yeah, everyone says
that I look better in person.

5
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:30.049 line:80%
By the way, have we met before?

6
00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:31.759 line:80%
You look familiar.

7
00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:33.427 line:80%
We've never met.

8
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.304 line:80%
But we know the same person.

9
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.227 line:80%
Kang Ji-won stole my fiancé.

10
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.610 line:80%
Goodness... Are you stupid?

11
00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:52.446 line:80%
How could you bring up money first?

12
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.032 line:80%
I said to work her acting like a good mom!

13
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.450 line:80%
I tried!

14
00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:58.285 line:80%
She just drew the line.

15
00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.831 line:80%
She confronted me right in my face.
She's really something.

16
00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:04.708 line:80%
Then you should've played dumb!

17
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:06.460 line:80%
Forget it.

18
00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:09.755 line:80%
No wonder why you live a crappy life.

19
00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:11.632 line:80%
Damn it.

20
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:12.800 line:80%
MIN-HWAN

21
00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.636 line:80%
Where'd you get Ji-hyuk's photos?

22
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.347 line:80%
Took you long enough to ask. Why?

23
00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:20.349 line:80%
Where are you? It's late.

24
00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.685 line:80%
I'm asking you a question!

25
00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:25.312 line:80%
Did you get those in an envelope?

26
00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.356 line:80%
What did it say?

27
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:32.027 line:80%
How do you know that?

28
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:40.911 line:80%
"Friend"?

29
00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:53.048 line:80%
I guess a rich girl is upset
because someone stole her man.

30
00:02:53.924 --> 00:02:58.178 line:80%
But shrimps are smart these days.

31
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.391 line:80%
They know they'll only suffer
in a whales' fight.

32
00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:04.143 line:80%
Are you joking me?

33
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.020 line:80%
Damn it...

34
00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.358 line:80%
Where am I? Why did I follow her here?

35
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:15.738 line:80%
People who think like you
live as shrimp all their lives.

36
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.073 line:80%
Especially you, a freshwater shrimp.

37
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:22.202 line:80%
A bite-sized one
who doesn't know how big the ocean is.

38
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.247 line:80%
You little... Say it again.

39
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.584 line:80%
Then live like a loser
for the rest of your life.

40
00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:33.339 line:80%
Wondering why nothing goes your way
and feeling sorry for yourself.

41
00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:34.882 line:80%
Watch your mouth.

42
00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:38.802 line:80%
You must not know
how scary a shrimp can be, rich girl.

43
00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:42.473 line:80%
You'll bleed if a shrimp bites.

44
00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.900 line:80%
Don't just be a shrimp that bites,

45
00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:55.361 line:80%
be a shrimp that can beat a whale.

46
00:03:55.444 --> 00:04:00.282 line:80%
Do you think Kang Ji-won's the only one
whose life can change overnight?

47
00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:04.536 line:80%
Why is that chance coming to me?

48
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.873 line:80%
Because I'm angry.

49
00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.627 line:80%
She lives well after stealing my man.
It's not fair.

50
00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.589 line:80%
And people like me
can't stand feeling cheated, you see.

51
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:23.013 line:80%
I get to blow off steam
and get U&K if I'm lucky.

52
00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.686 line:80%
You punish the woman who betrayed you,
and change your life with a fortune.

53
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:33.899 line:80%
What do I have to do

54
00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.110 line:80%
to make that happen?

55
00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:39.697 line:80%
Well...

56
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:44.243 line:80%
I'll tell you when you've made up
your mind, shrimp.

57
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.280 line:80%
EPISODE 13

58
00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:25.367 line:80%
The chef's on a business trip
to the States?

59
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.706 line:80%
No, I can adjust my schedule.

60
00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.667 line:80%
If you could let me know
when he'll be available...

61
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.794 line:80%
Yes.

62
00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:37.588 line:80%
To the company?

63
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.215 line:80%
No, that's fine.

64
00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.427 line:80%
Yes.

65
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.139 line:80%
Have you checked the proposal I sent you?

66
00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.016 line:80%
The latest version.

67
00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:55.022 line:80%
What are you doing?

68
00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:58.067 line:80%
You're more ambitious than I thought.

69
00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:00.194 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk.

70
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:03.155 line:80%
How did you know
he was from the owner family?

71
00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:07.326 line:80%
He looks like a loser.
I couldn't tell at all.

72
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.621 line:80%
You know now. I knew way before.

73
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.831 line:80%
Don't you remember?

74
00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:14.666 line:80%
I was always better than you.

75
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.088 line:80%
So when was it?

76
00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:22.633 line:80%
I'm getting sick of this.

77
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.259 line:80%
Damn it...

78
00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:26.845 line:80%
The company benefits. I should've known.

79
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.307 line:80%
Did you two develop feelings
the night I proposed?

80
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.770 line:80%
That's why you ruined the family meeting
and humiliated me at work.

81
00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.772 line:80%
Everything makes sense now.

82
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.150 line:80%
When did you start planning all this?

83
00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:41.527 line:80%
Tell me!

84
00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.239 line:80%
What the hell are you saying?

85
00:06:48.534 --> 00:06:50.911 line:80%
You're forgetting one missing piece.

86
00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.913 line:80%
You cheated on me with Su-min.

87
00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.582 line:80%
That's the cause of all of this.

88
00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:03.173 line:80%
That little...

89
00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:15.686 line:80%
Ji-won!

90
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:19.731 line:80%
Hi.

91
00:07:21.692 --> 00:07:23.026 line:80%
What brings you here?

92
00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:25.571 line:80%
Ji-hyuk sent me here.

93
00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:29.158 line:80%
Have this. I fried it at my restaurant.

94
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:31.410 line:80%
-Take it.
-Okay.

95
00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.536 line:80%
Thanks.

96
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.581 line:80%
He said to continue judo.

97
00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:39.877 line:80%
If you're uncomfortable because of him,

98
00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.505 line:80%
he asked me to give you my number.

99
00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.760 line:80%
Ji-hyuk is a great guy.

100
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:53.599 line:80%
He's really tall
and has a great personality.

101
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:58.812 line:80%
Also, if I didn't meet him in our club,
I wouldn't be doing anything.

102
00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:01.481 line:80%
He's a decent and nice person.

103
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:04.526 line:80%
Wait, that chicken...

104
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.652 line:80%
Did you order chicken?

105
00:08:05.736 --> 00:08:09.907 line:80%
Did you order hot fried chicken, spicy
chicken, and salty soy sauce chicken?

106
00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:13.785 line:80%
Yes.

107
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.830 line:80%
Something did feel off then.

108
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:21.418 line:80%
And he's so athletic.
He's so good at judo.

109
00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:25.672 line:80%
Wait... The black mask.

110
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.764 line:80%
Did these bastards play me?

111
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.643 line:80%
Kang Ji-won.

112
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:44.775 line:80%
I will make you regret it.

113
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.896 line:80%
Do you want to come up?

114
00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:24.106 line:80%
What?

115
00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:27.442 line:80%
No, I don't like violence.

116
00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:30.654 line:80%
You're no fun. Why not?

117
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:34.574 line:80%
You can cheat on your girlfriend
of seven years with her bestie,

118
00:09:34.658 --> 00:09:36.660 line:80%
but you can't throw a punch?

119
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.334 line:80%
I'm old enough to know
what I can and can't do.

120
00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:50.590 line:80%
You can't do what we're about to do
without guts.

121
00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:56.555 line:80%
All right, then.

122
00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:00.642 line:80%
But no matter how rich you are
and how hard you trained,

123
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.353 line:80%
men have the advantage.

124
00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:08.275 line:80%
You don't know how scary men can be.

125
00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:09.735 line:80%
What?

126
00:10:18.994 --> 00:10:20.370 line:80%
Oh, I'm fighting him?

127
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:23.790 line:80%
Stop glaring, dude.

128
00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:30.088 line:80%
Let's go.

129
00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:44.770 line:80%
This is boxing. Are you allowed to kick?

130
00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.772 line:80%
There are no rules for winning.

131
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:50.192 line:80%
Then you should've told me beforehand!

132
00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:55.947 line:80%
I'm starting to like you now.
I can work with you.

133
00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.996 line:80%
I took care of the taxes today.

134
00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.874 line:80%
Now, Kang Ji-won has unknowingly become

135
00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:08.710 line:80%
one of the richest real estate owners
in Korea.

136
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.296 line:80%
Is this really right?

137
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.215 line:80%
Why not?

138
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.092 line:80%
And here's a bigger problem.

139
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.262 line:80%
I'm not sure
about not telling the chairman.

140
00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.265 line:80%
You're the one who said
I could do anything.

141
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:23.975 line:80%
I did.

142
00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:26.937 line:80%
But what are you trying to do?

143
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:32.025 line:80%
If I wasn't managing your health
checkup results, I'd think you were dying.

144
00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:36.905 line:80%
I can understand the cat,
but why prepare for Ms. Kang's future?

145
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.492 line:80%
Didn't you two break up?

146
00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.162 line:80%
I just want to do this.

147
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:47.707 line:80%
I just hope she'll live
a good life later on.

148
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.962 line:80%
Since we're not meant to be together.

149
00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.798 line:80%
Ji-won has real estate in her name.

150
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.677 line:80%
Buildings, land, apartments.

151
00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.805 line:80%
Worth about 80 billion won.

152
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.186 line:80%
Kang Ji-won has 80 billion won?

153
00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:19.281 line:80%
What?

154
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.991 line:80%
You shouldn't be surprised.

155
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:24.828 line:80%
You'll get 100 times more than that
if she dies.

156
00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.622 line:80%
Wait, 100 times?

157
00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.876 line:80%
Your wife's relationship with Ji-won
is so fun.

158
00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:34.546 line:80%
They're not like sisters.

159
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.965 line:80%
You could say they're actually sisters.

160
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:42.471 line:80%
FRY ME
JO DONG-SUK

161
00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.558 line:80%
I can explain this.

162
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.560 line:80%
Because Ji-hyuk's U&K's successor?

163
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.061 line:80%
Do you have any money?

164
00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:58.987 line:80%
Dad.

165
00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.449 line:80%
I thought I could do well this time,

166
00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:05.327 line:80%
but I don't know what to do.

167
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.300 line:80%
You kept a lot of things from me.

168
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.262 line:80%
Like what?

169
00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:28.225 line:80%
You used Ji-won's mom to swindle her
but failed.

170
00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:31.353 line:80%
How did you know that?

171
00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.276 line:80%
You dummy.

172
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.071 line:80%
The person who sent you the photos

173
00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:44.157 line:80%
wasn't suggesting you find her mom
to beg for money.

174
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:48.537 line:80%
What's important right now
is that Ji-won has 80 billion won.

175
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.705 line:80%
What? She has 80 billion won?

176
00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:55.835 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk gave it to her.

177
00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:58.964 line:80%
She's on another level.

178
00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:10.725 line:80%
Kang Ji-won...

179
00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.321 line:80%
But it's good for us.

180
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.783 line:80%
If she dies,

181
00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.452 line:80%
her only family member gets it, her mom.

182
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.122 line:80%
We just wait until she dies?

183
00:14:33.582 --> 00:14:34.958 line:80%
And if she dies,

184
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.668 line:80%
will her mom give it to us?

185
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.677 line:80%
Su-min, you poor thing.

186
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.889 line:80%
How hard has it been for you
not being able to tell me?

187
00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:55.228 line:80%
Your dad...

188
00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.357 line:80%
I know he's still alive.

189
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.823 line:80%
Bring the money!

190
00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.367 line:80%
Why are you doing this?

191
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.539 line:80%
Look. If you borrowed money,
you should pay it back.

192
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.792 line:80%
You run a restaurant
but say you have no money.

193
00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:21.212 line:80%
What should we do?

194
00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:23.840 line:80%
I mean... Listen to me.

195
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:27.677 line:80%
I'll get the money to you
within this month no matter what.

196
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.138 line:80%
Are you joking me?

197
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:34.768 line:80%
You should show sincerity
if you want to build trust with us.

198
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:38.897 line:80%
Get us a 100 million won,
and we'll give you more time.

199
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.567 line:80%
Where can I get that kind of cash?

200
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:45.111 line:80%
-I swear...
-Hey, hold him.

201
00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:48.114 line:80%
What are you doing?

202
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.909 line:80%
You can live with one kidney.

203
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.702 line:80%
-What?
-If you have half a liver,

204
00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:53.703 line:80%
it grows back.

205
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.707 line:80%
-Look...
-Look at what?

206
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.086 line:80%
Shall I break it?

207
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.178 line:80%
What now?

208
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.019 line:80%
Su-min.

209
00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:21.564 line:80%
What are you doing here?

210
00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:30.407 line:80%
Where's the lady you live with?

211
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.534 line:80%
What?

212
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.648 line:80%
It's a stock transfer certificate

213
00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:06.735 line:80%
that can separate Cloud Air
and Kelite Tour from U&K.

214
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.029 line:80%
You can take full control.

215
00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:13.783 line:80%
You had me curious.

216
00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:17.871 line:80%
It's a small price
if it's for that great love of yours.

217
00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.957 line:80%
And it's boring
if you want me to get lost with it.

218
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.461 line:80%
You were never interested in me.

219
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.838 line:80%
I'm asking you to live that way.

220
00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:29.966 line:80%
No, you weren't interested in me,
but weren't

221
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.177 line:80%
going to call off the engagement.

222
00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:36.431 line:80%
We would've gotten married
when time was right

223
00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:40.226 line:80%
and lived our own lives,
indifferent to each other.

224
00:17:58.495 --> 00:17:59.662 line:80%
This is nice.

225
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.209 line:80%
Like a jealous man afraid
his fiancée has another man...

226
00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:08.546 line:80%
I like it when a man's restless.

227
00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.140 line:80%
Do you want to try it?

228
00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:25.063 line:80%
Finding each other's weakness
and tormenting one another?

229
00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:30.819 line:80%
Don't forget that I can do
whatever you can do.

230
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.320 line:80%
No...

231
00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:35.073 line:80%
Won't I be better at it?

232
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.586 line:80%
Take this and stop what you're doing.

233
00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:54.384 line:80%
I don't know why you think
I'd do anything.

234
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.470 line:80%
Things you just said, it hurts.

235
00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.306 line:80%
Even without this, I won't do anything.

236
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.309 line:80%
I realized breaking off
the engagement was a mistake.

237
00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:04.978 line:80%
I just want to take it back.

238
00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.024 line:80%
Have your fun.

239
00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:13.736 line:80%
Love always comes to an end.

240
00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:18.950 line:80%
When yours does, come back to me.

241
00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.763 line:80%
There's something you need to look into.

242
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:49.105 line:80%
Come out.

243
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:55.153 line:80%
What... What just happened?

244
00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.529 line:80%
Wasn't that Ji-hyuk?

245
00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:58.239 line:80%
Are we caught?

246
00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:03.494 line:80%
Do you know how much
Cloud Air and Kelite Tour are worth?

247
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.038 line:80%
What?

248
00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.582 line:80%
When combined,

249
00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.543 line:80%
about four trillion.

250
00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.672 line:80%
Four trillion won?

251
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.967 line:80%
But he just gave it to me.
It's so upsetting.

252
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:26.392 line:80%
Kill Kang Ji-won. I'll clean up the mess.

253
00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.939 line:80%
You'll have enough money
for the rest of your life.

254
00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:33.900 line:80%
I'll get Yu Ji-hyuk.

255
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:39.072 line:80%
And I'll make sure he regrets
offering me something like that.

256
00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.707 line:80%
It's 150 million won.

257
00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:52.627 line:80%
Pay off your urgent debts first.

258
00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.421 line:80%
I'll pay the rest off when it's over.

259
00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:58.174 line:80%
And I'll make sure you get a fortune.

260
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:02.428 line:80%
Where... Where did you get this money?

261
00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.264 line:80%
Do you think it's mine?

262
00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.267 line:80%
What did you ever do for me?

263
00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:15.149 line:80%
Listen up. This money...

264
00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:20.613 line:80%
was given by someone who could bury you
without anyone knowing.

265
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:25.326 line:80%
Do as you're told,
and this shitty life is over.

266
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.619 line:80%
Or...

267
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:29.747 line:80%
we'll all die together.

268
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.212 line:80%
Can you do it or not?

269
00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:39.424 line:80%
We can.

270
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.177 line:80%
Yeah.

271
00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:46.764 line:80%
Okay, good job.

272
00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:49.058 line:80%
You didn't tell them about me, right?

273
00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:51.686 line:80%
Yeah, they don't know
we're married anyway.

274
00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:53.896 line:80%
Let's not make things uncomfortable.

275
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.065 line:80%
I won't see them again after this.

276
00:21:56.607 --> 00:22:00.111 line:80%
Of course. We're telling them
what to do, step by step.

277
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.454 line:80%
They said yes. Shall I get started?

278
00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.164 line:80%
Yeah, good luck.

279
00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:13.416 line:80%
I'll trust you.

280
00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:16.085 line:80%
Okay.

281
00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:20.965 line:80%
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

282
00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:35.146 line:80%
Men are not wary of women they slept with.

283
00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:36.731 line:80%
Why is that?

284
00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:41.569 line:80%
Ji-won's dad's death anniversary
is this weekend.

285
00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:45.573 line:80%
We can make that D-day then.

286
00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:47.366 line:80%
She'll go see her dad.

287
00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:56.209 line:80%
MEMORIAL ARBORETUM

288
00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:14.143 line:80%
I'm sorry I'm such a fool.

289
00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:27.782 line:80%
Yes, Mr. Lee?

290
00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:30.201 line:80%
Yu-ra hasn't made any moves.

291
00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:32.912 line:80%
But I think we made a mistake.

292
00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:38.084 line:80%
Ji-won's mother illegally rented
a dump truck under a borrowed name.

293
00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:41.087 line:80%
-That means--
-If she dies,

294
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.381 line:80%
all of the real estate in her name

295
00:23:43.464 --> 00:23:44.924 line:80%
will go to her mother.

296
00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:47.969 line:80%
Where's the dump truck now?

297
00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:51.305 line:80%
According to the current GPS,

298
00:23:51.389 --> 00:23:53.266 line:80%
it's going down Route 424.

299
00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:22.628 line:80%
Ji-won's leaving the arboretum now.

300
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:31.304 line:80%
What the heck?

301
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:35.433 line:80%
What is this?

302
00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:38.477 line:80%
Yes.

303
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:41.439 line:80%
Sin-u, stop Ji-won. Don't let her drive.

304
00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:45.568 line:80%
What? But Ji-hyuk,
my car broke down in the parking lot.

305
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:47.320 line:80%
Ji-won already drove off.

306
00:24:47.403 --> 00:24:49.488 line:80%
Route 424 is right outside of here.

307
00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:51.949 line:80%
Hello?

308
00:24:56.537 --> 00:25:01.000 line:80%
There are times when things that were
foggy and unclear become clear.

309
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.972 line:80%
Why did I come back to this time?

310
00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:19.685 line:80%
If I had, I'd have protected her.

311
00:25:21.229 --> 00:25:25.107 line:80%
So if I get a chance, I'll take it.

312
00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:30.279 line:80%
If I can't be with her,
why did I come back?

313
00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:37.995 line:80%
JI-WON

314
00:25:39.497 --> 00:25:42.333 line:80%
The person you have called is unavailable.

315
00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:44.585 line:80%
Leave a message after the beep.

316
00:25:46.754 --> 00:25:50.049 line:80%
I'll tell you something
I didn't expect to tell you like this.

317
00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:55.304 line:80%
I died in 2023.

318
00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.808 line:80%
It was a car accident.

319
00:26:02.353 --> 00:26:05.982 line:80%
And when I opened my eyes, I was in 2013.

320
00:26:12.113 --> 00:26:14.156 line:80%
Then I met you again.

321
00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:20.746 line:80%
I mistakenly believed I could be happy.

322
00:26:23.666 --> 00:26:28.170 line:80%
But I can't protect you forever.

323
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.176 line:80%
I could die at any time.

324
00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:47.940 line:80%
I couldn't resist
the temptation to be with you.

325
00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:54.113 line:80%
I like you.

326
00:26:57.116 --> 00:26:58.284 line:80%
I like you.

327
00:27:02.747 --> 00:27:04.165 line:80%
I like you so much.

328
00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:10.338 line:80%
So...

329
00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:16.302 line:80%
I'm sorry.

330
00:27:57.802 --> 00:27:59.345 line:80%
I came here to protect you,

331
00:28:03.933 --> 00:28:05.935 line:80%
but if I knew it'd happen so soon,

332
00:28:13.943 --> 00:28:15.778 line:80%
I wouldn't have held your hand.

333
00:28:56.277 --> 00:28:57.820 line:80%
Don't blame yourself.

334
00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:02.533 line:80%
The inevitable just happened.

335
00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:37.985 line:80%
New voice message.

336
00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:44.408 line:80%
I died in 2023.

337
00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.537 line:80%
It was a car accident.

338
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:53.918 line:80%
Why won't he pick up?

339
00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:57.838 line:80%
All he had to do was crash into her!

340
00:29:57.922 --> 00:30:00.132 line:80%
He should've called way earlier.

341
00:30:00.216 --> 00:30:01.842 line:80%
Why can't I reach him?

342
00:30:01.926 --> 00:30:04.887 line:80%
You're talking
about your daughter's life ending.

343
00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:07.848 line:80%
I guess you're not worried.

344
00:30:08.349 --> 00:30:09.308 line:80%
You brat.

345
00:30:10.226 --> 00:30:12.061 line:80%
You put it in such a mean way.

346
00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:14.855 line:80%
Do you know what's scarier than blood?

347
00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:15.773 line:80%
It's money.

348
00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:18.526 line:80%
Don't make me laugh.

349
00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:20.778 line:80%
You wouldn't be with my dad then.

350
00:30:21.904 --> 00:30:25.574 line:80%
He's pretentious,
and everything he says is a lie.

351
00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:30.204 line:80%
He offers you everything,
but he never does anything for you.

352
00:30:30.287 --> 00:30:33.666 line:80%
Listen to you,
talking about your father like that.

353
00:30:35.084 --> 00:30:36.418 line:80%
Do you have any idea

354
00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:41.340 line:80%
how much my dad pretended to love me?

355
00:30:42.883 --> 00:30:47.263 line:80%
But when I think about it,
he's never actually done anything for me.

356
00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.057 line:80%
What about you?

357
00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:53.769 line:80%
I'm sure nothing he does goes right.

358
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.814 line:80%
Maybe you even clean up his mess.

359
00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:06.865 line:80%
Why do you look like that?

360
00:31:13.414 --> 00:31:15.666 line:80%
Because he never does anything right!

361
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:25.634 line:80%
You must be under a lot of stress.

362
00:31:25.718 --> 00:31:27.303 line:80%
This part is so stiff.

363
00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:29.471 line:80%
You're good at this.

364
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.144 line:80%
Mr. Yu cut in and got hurt,
and is now in Yuil Medical Center.

365
00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:37.605 line:80%
And the driver ran from the scene.

366
00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:40.399 line:80%
How could Ji-hyuk be there?

367
00:31:41.317 --> 00:31:42.818 line:80%
I'm looking into it. I'm sorry.

368
00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:46.530 line:80%
It must be nice.

369
00:31:46.614 --> 00:31:50.159 line:80%
All you have to do is apologize
since I clean up the mess.

370
00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:55.205 line:80%
Wait.

371
00:31:55.289 --> 00:31:58.250 line:80%
Isn't the woman and his daughter
at the hotel?

372
00:31:58.334 --> 00:32:00.878 line:80%
Then the driver must've gone there.

373
00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:03.047 line:80%
Search that area first.

374
00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:08.761 line:80%
Take your wife and go home.

375
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:10.471 line:80%
Nothing happened.

376
00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:12.973 line:80%
Don't do anything until I call.

377
00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:15.684 line:80%
Okay.

378
00:32:20.064 --> 00:32:21.440 line:80%
Are you insane?

379
00:32:23.525 --> 00:32:26.403 line:80%
My dad abandoned me again.

380
00:32:26.487 --> 00:32:29.531 line:80%
He ran away with that woman!

381
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:33.827 line:80%
What did I do wrong?

382
00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:37.414 line:80%
What did I do wrong?

383
00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:40.834 line:80%
It's all Ji-won's fault!

384
00:32:40.918 --> 00:32:42.670 line:80%
I'm going to kill them all!

385
00:32:42.753 --> 00:32:45.839 line:80%
It's Ji-won's fault! I'll kill her too!

386
00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:48.676 line:80%
I'll kill everyone!

387
00:32:54.682 --> 00:32:59.228 line:80%
Jeong Su-min!
Snap out of it. It's not over yet.

388
00:33:00.521 --> 00:33:02.314 line:80%
That woman's on our side.

389
00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:06.360 line:80%
There's a world
people like us don't know about.

390
00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:08.195 line:80%
Let's just do as we're told.

391
00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:11.865 line:80%
She said she'd clean up the mess.

392
00:33:12.866 --> 00:33:14.368 line:80%
We were home all night.

393
00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:16.704 line:80%
If the cops come,

394
00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:19.331 line:80%
you don't know about your dad.

395
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:21.834 line:80%
Got it?

396
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:26.880 line:80%
Well?

397
00:33:26.964 --> 00:33:30.259 line:80%
He arrived at the ER an hour ago
and went into surgery.

398
00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:33.303 line:80%
Top doctors are on him.
I'll explain with the chart.

399
00:33:39.893 --> 00:33:41.854 line:80%
OPERATION TIME, ANESTHESIA TIME

400
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:48.068 line:80%
Isn't the surgery taking too long?

401
00:33:49.403 --> 00:33:50.863 line:80%
What if my brother...

402
00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:51.905 line:80%
No.

403
00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:54.324 line:80%
The inevitable just happened.

404
00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:57.619 line:80%
That will never happen.

405
00:33:59.163 --> 00:34:00.706 line:80%
So don't think that way.

406
00:34:16.513 --> 00:34:18.682 line:80%
The driver's name is Jeong Man-sik.

407
00:34:18.766 --> 00:34:20.225 line:80%
We must get him first.

408
00:34:20.309 --> 00:34:23.812 line:80%
And get information on Bae Hui-suk too
from the police.

409
00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:27.900 line:80%
Jeong Su-min could
never have done this on her own.

410
00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:35.199 line:80%
Did you just say Jeong Su-min?

411
00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:40.579 line:80%
It wasn't just a car accident, was it?

412
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:53.967 line:80%
But she won't gain anything
from killing me.

413
00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:56.386 line:80%
And she's not daring enough to kill.

414
00:34:58.514 --> 00:35:02.059 line:80%
We're looking into it
assuming there's someone behind this.

415
00:35:03.185 --> 00:35:05.229 line:80%
And what they gain if you die is...

416
00:35:08.315 --> 00:35:09.733 line:80%
something Ji-hyuk made.

417
00:35:13.612 --> 00:35:15.405 line:80%
It was supposed to be for you.

418
00:35:30.337 --> 00:35:31.964 line:80%
People don't change easily.

419
00:35:32.965 --> 00:35:37.052 line:80%
I came back after seeing the end,
but I tried to run away again.

420
00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:40.430 line:80%
I didn't get revenge.

421
00:35:40.514 --> 00:35:43.267 line:80%
I haven't done anything.

422
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.853 line:80%
And Mr. Yu...

423
00:35:50.774 --> 00:35:52.359 line:80%
We did everything we could.

424
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:56.446 line:80%
But we don't know when he'll wake up.

425
00:35:57.656 --> 00:35:59.533 line:80%
You have to save him.

426
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.204 line:80%
What are you talking about?
You have to save him at all cost!

427
00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:11.920 line:80%
But I can't protect you forever.

428
00:36:14.298 --> 00:36:15.716 line:80%
I could die at any time.

429
00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:32.691 line:80%
So forget all the bad things

430
00:36:33.567 --> 00:36:35.110 line:80%
and remember the good.

431
00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:37.738 line:80%
I hope you're happy.

432
00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:02.596 line:80%
OTHER HALF

433
00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:28.038 line:80%
Can you really not leave me alone?

434
00:37:33.669 --> 00:37:37.214 line:80%
I've wanted to ask you for some time,
and I finally can.

435
00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:42.803 line:80%
How could you think of killing someone?

436
00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:46.264 line:80%
Was it for money?

437
00:37:48.517 --> 00:37:49.768 line:80%
What are you saying?

438
00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:53.855 line:80%
Why would you say something so scary?

439
00:37:57.776 --> 00:37:59.111 line:80%
What about you?

440
00:37:59.903 --> 00:38:02.072 line:80%
Don't you know what you did to me?

441
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:10.789 line:80%
I...

442
00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:17.963 line:80%
miscarried because of you.

443
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:23.010 line:80%
That's nonsense.

444
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.678 line:80%
Pregnant?

445
00:38:25.178 --> 00:38:26.930 line:80%
Min-hwan has azoospermia.

446
00:38:27.014 --> 00:38:29.725 line:80%
He can't get anyone pregnant!

447
00:38:30.851 --> 00:38:32.644 line:80%
What? I was really pregnant.

448
00:38:32.728 --> 00:38:35.105 line:80%
I have an ultrasound picture. I felt it.

449
00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:37.482 line:80%
That's enough!

450
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:42.696 line:80%
Stop lying. You keep lying and lying!

451
00:38:45.115 --> 00:38:47.826 line:80%
What's with you?
Why are you doing this to me?

452
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.039 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

453
00:39:09.765 --> 00:39:11.725 line:80%
You asked if I could leave you alone...

454
00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:20.942 line:80%
No, I can't.

455
00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:24.571 line:80%
Because you can't be happy.

456
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.494 line:80%
You probably don't know.

457
00:39:30.577 --> 00:39:34.873 line:80%
When your mom had an affair
and left you when we were 14,

458
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:36.500 line:80%
it was...

459
00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:39.127 line:80%
with my dad.

460
00:39:42.672 --> 00:39:44.883 line:80%
You had no idea and were so happy.

461
00:39:45.801 --> 00:39:47.135 line:80%
Because of that...

462
00:39:49.346 --> 00:39:51.848 line:80%
Dad, why won't you come home?

463
00:39:51.932 --> 00:39:54.643 line:80%
Mom said you left
because you had an affair.

464
00:39:55.143 --> 00:39:56.853 line:80%
She said you abandoned us.

465
00:39:56.937 --> 00:39:59.397 line:80%
Say anything. Just call me.

466
00:39:59.481 --> 00:40:03.735 line:80%
If you do this, I'll kill myself.
I'll be good, so take me with you.

467
00:40:06.196 --> 00:40:09.616 line:80%
I told you to come and help.
Why are you at home right now?

468
00:40:10.242 --> 00:40:11.660 line:80%
I have to study!

469
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.037 line:80%
God, you reek of fish.

470
00:40:14.121 --> 00:40:15.956 line:80%
You little brat.

471
00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:17.958 line:80%
Study, my foot.

472
00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:21.253 line:80%
Your dad might've been sweet to you,
but not me.

473
00:40:21.336 --> 00:40:23.255 line:80%
Wake up and know your place.

474
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.841 line:80%
Or just go to your dad!

475
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:27.968 line:80%
I can't stand you!

476
00:40:36.893 --> 00:40:38.061 line:80%
Someone's calling.

477
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.564 line:80%
Who is it? Is it a woman?

478
00:40:41.106 --> 00:40:43.066 line:80%
No, it's my daughter.

479
00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:45.569 line:80%
I'm sick of this.

480
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:47.779 line:80%
She's just like her mom.

481
00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:51.074 line:80%
I can't even begin to tell you
how tenacious she is.

482
00:40:51.158 --> 00:40:53.702 line:80%
You're not thinking of raising her, right?

483
00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:58.081 line:80%
If you do, I'll bring mine too,
dump her on you, and run away.

484
00:40:58.165 --> 00:40:59.666 line:80%
Why would I do that?

485
00:41:00.292 --> 00:41:03.461 line:80%
You're the only princess I need.

486
00:41:03.545 --> 00:41:04.796 line:80%
You're so gross.

487
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.381 line:80%
Let's go.

488
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:11.803 line:80%
My dad's new princess had a daughter.

489
00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:29.738 line:80%
Did you lose your wallet?

490
00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:33.533 line:80%
Goodness. You make it so obvious
that your mother ran away.

491
00:41:33.617 --> 00:41:35.452 line:80%
Don't be so nosy.

492
00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:42.125 line:80%
Here.

493
00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:43.835 line:80%
Is it yours?

494
00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:46.671 line:80%
So...

495
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.801 line:80%
we could've been good friends.

496
00:41:51.885 --> 00:41:53.887 line:80%
Turn on the floor heating. It's cold.

497
00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:55.222 line:80%
It's so cold.

498
00:41:57.098 --> 00:41:59.142 line:80%
What? It's warm.

499
00:41:59.226 --> 00:42:00.268 line:80%
Is it?

500
00:42:01.645 --> 00:42:02.938 line:80%
My dad turned it on.

501
00:42:04.147 --> 00:42:07.692 line:80%
You said a friend was coming,
so I warmed it up.

502
00:42:07.776 --> 00:42:08.777 line:80%
Dad.

503
00:42:10.362 --> 00:42:11.279 line:80%
Hello.

504
00:42:11.363 --> 00:42:14.199 line:80%
My goodness. You're so pretty.

505
00:42:14.824 --> 00:42:18.912 line:80%
I bought the cake
that young girls love these days.

506
00:42:18.995 --> 00:42:22.999 line:80%
Make sure to eat it with milk, okay?

507
00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:28.129 line:80%
An allowance.

508
00:42:31.383 --> 00:42:32.384 line:80%
Your allowance.

509
00:42:34.177 --> 00:42:36.137 line:80%
-Thank you.
-I'm off.

510
00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:38.014 line:80%
Have fun.

511
00:42:44.312 --> 00:42:45.605 line:80%
He did it again.

512
00:42:47.274 --> 00:42:48.400 line:80%
Just a second.

513
00:42:50.443 --> 00:42:53.363 line:80%
Dad! I told you not to draw
on money like this.

514
00:42:53.446 --> 00:42:54.656 line:80%
Okay, fine.

515
00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.367 line:80%
I promise, I won't do it again.

516
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.953 line:80%
Don't drive too fast. Go slowly.

517
00:43:00.954 --> 00:43:03.331 line:80%
When did you get so pretty, Princess?

518
00:43:03.415 --> 00:43:05.542 line:80%
Don't call me that.

519
00:43:06.126 --> 00:43:08.086 line:80%
It's because I love you.

520
00:43:11.047 --> 00:43:16.052 line:80%
Maybe if I didn't know
that you still had everything, unlike me.

521
00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.557 line:80%
He thinks I might be

522
00:43:21.725 --> 00:43:23.435 line:80%
downhearted without a mom.

523
00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:24.728 line:80%
He overdoes it.

524
00:43:25.854 --> 00:43:26.980 line:80%
Don't mind him.

525
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:30.233 line:80%
That's when I started

526
00:43:30.317 --> 00:43:32.360 line:80%
to be bothered by you.

527
00:43:33.737 --> 00:43:37.574 line:80%
And started to want
to steal everything from you.

528
00:43:42.746 --> 00:43:44.414 line:80%
Why are you always okay?

529
00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:48.626 line:80%
Why are there...

530
00:43:50.337 --> 00:43:52.589 line:80%
always good things around you?

531
00:44:03.475 --> 00:44:04.684 line:80%
Do you get it now?

532
00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:08.396 line:80%
I've never liked you.

533
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:11.524 line:80%
You were always smiling without a clue.

534
00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:14.736 line:80%
Being happy is a sin.

535
00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:17.614 line:80%
You're so clueless. It's annoying!

536
00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:22.619 line:80%
Do you know how hard life can be?

537
00:44:23.286 --> 00:44:25.580 line:80%
Do you know how hellish it can be?

538
00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:29.751 line:80%
You can't be happy when I'm so miserable.

539
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.422 line:80%
Now, I'll show you

540
00:44:35.048 --> 00:44:37.092 line:80%
how unkind the world can be.

541
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:39.761 line:80%
How hellish...

542
00:44:43.098 --> 00:44:44.724 line:80%
life can be.

543
00:44:54.984 --> 00:44:56.361 line:80%
Was that all?

544
00:45:02.409 --> 00:45:05.620 line:80%
"Your dad had an affair with my mom."

545
00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:08.081 line:80%
"No one knew, but you did."

546
00:45:10.417 --> 00:45:11.793 line:80%
You think...

547
00:45:13.586 --> 00:45:15.630 line:80%
you can make me suffer

548
00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:19.342 line:80%
and steal what's precious to me
for that reason? Really?

549
00:45:22.095 --> 00:45:24.139 line:80%
You're so full of yourself.

550
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:26.724 line:80%
I hate it when you act like a know-it-all.

551
00:45:26.808 --> 00:45:28.977 line:80%
Don't you feel sorry for me?

552
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.312 line:80%
I feel so bad for myself!

553
00:45:31.396 --> 00:45:32.480 line:80%
Not at all!

554
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.941 line:80%
I don't feel bad for you.

555
00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:37.777 line:80%
Because I knew too.

556
00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:45.952 line:80%
That your dad...

557
00:45:47.787 --> 00:45:49.414 line:80%
had an affair with my mom.

558
00:45:50.623 --> 00:45:51.958 line:80%
I knew it too.

559
00:45:56.337 --> 00:45:58.047 line:80%
I thought it was a relief...

560
00:46:03.595 --> 00:46:05.096 line:80%
that you didn't know.

561
00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:11.644 line:80%
Why do we have to do this?

562
00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:15.482 line:80%
My dad would've come to school
if he were alive.

563
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.320 line:80%
Did he die two years ago?

564
00:46:21.488 --> 00:46:23.615 line:80%
-Yeah.
-I bet you miss him.

565
00:46:23.698 --> 00:46:25.283 line:80%
I miss him so much.

566
00:46:25.867 --> 00:46:28.369 line:80%
He loved me so much.

567
00:46:32.499 --> 00:46:34.209 line:80%
-Dad!
-Hi.

568
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.963 line:80%
-Dad!
-Hey!

569
00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.257 line:80%
It's raining. Let's go.

570
00:46:42.133 --> 00:46:43.218 line:80%
Mom!

571
00:47:06.115 --> 00:47:07.825 line:80%
I wanted to be good to you.

572
00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:11.037 line:80%
I thought we could be happy together.

573
00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:17.752 line:80%
Even when I felt like I was dying...

574
00:47:26.052 --> 00:47:30.431 line:80%
I hoped you'd be happy
even when I was dying.

575
00:47:37.564 --> 00:47:39.274 line:80%
Don't act like you cared.

576
00:47:40.275 --> 00:47:42.777 line:80%
You dumped Min-hwan on me for a rich guy?

577
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.410 line:80%
You dumped him on me!

578
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.414 line:80%
You were always like this.

579
00:47:54.497 --> 00:47:58.001 line:80%
You pretend to be nice
and took everything in the end!

580
00:47:58.084 --> 00:47:59.961 line:80%
You took everything!

581
00:48:03.631 --> 00:48:04.966 line:80%
I just realized

582
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.053 line:80%
why you ended up like this.

583
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.850 line:80%
You brought this upon yourself.

584
00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:17.770 line:80%
Also, it's not over yet.

585
00:48:18.938 --> 00:48:21.274 line:80%
A harsher hell awaits you.

586
00:48:23.192 --> 00:48:24.652 line:80%
I'll see to it.

587
00:48:32.994 --> 00:48:34.120 line:80%
Look forward to it.

588
00:48:35.538 --> 00:48:37.665 line:80%
It'll be different than before.

589
00:48:43.546 --> 00:48:47.925 line:80%
I'll make sure my fate goes to you.

590
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.408 line:80%
Go home and rest.

591
00:49:12.492 --> 00:49:13.993 line:80%
I'll stay here.

592
00:49:16.704 --> 00:49:18.164 line:80%
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER

593
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:27.799 line:80%
Ji-won, what are you doing
after work today?

594
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.260 line:80%
Can we meet for a moment?

595
00:49:31.844 --> 00:49:33.429 line:80%
Is something wrong?

596
00:49:34.764 --> 00:49:37.350 line:80%
It's embarrassing to say,

597
00:49:38.017 --> 00:49:41.396 line:80%
but I think my husband's cheating on me.

598
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.148 line:80%
This little...

599
00:49:57.578 --> 00:49:59.288 line:80%
PRINCESS PORK RIBS
OPEN 24 HOURS

600
00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:02.834 line:80%
Should I just get it to go?

601
00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:09.340 line:80%
Ms. Yang...

602
00:50:11.634 --> 00:50:12.635 line:80%
Come here.

603
00:50:12.719 --> 00:50:15.221 line:80%
I told you, not here. I can't believe you.

604
00:50:15.304 --> 00:50:16.848 line:80%
Why not?

605
00:50:16.931 --> 00:50:20.977 line:80%
I always walk on eggshells
around my sick wife and father-in-law.

606
00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:44.584 line:80%
Mr. Lee.

607
00:50:53.634 --> 00:50:54.635 line:80%
Put it on.

608
00:50:55.887 --> 00:50:57.930 line:80%
Snap out of it and put it on!

609
00:51:09.275 --> 00:51:12.904 line:80%
Go slap your husband
if you caught him cheating.

610
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:17.074 line:80%
Kick him, claw his eyes out,
and crack his skull open!

611
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:20.161 line:80%
Why are you running away?

612
00:51:22.038 --> 00:51:23.164 line:80%
How did you know?

613
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.334 line:80%
Is that what's important right now?

614
00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:29.670 line:80%
Do you want to go back?
Want to borrow my golf club?

615
00:51:30.797 --> 00:51:33.883 line:80%
How have you lived
to be so upright like this?

616
00:51:33.966 --> 00:51:36.052 line:80%
Even when I'm so out of line,

617
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:39.555 line:80%
why can't you get angry?

618
00:51:42.058 --> 00:51:45.311 line:80%
That's why he does it
even at your dad's restaurant.

619
00:52:00.409 --> 00:52:06.123 line:80%
Whether I can get angry or not,

620
00:52:07.708 --> 00:52:09.794 line:80%
isn't it wrong to act out like that?

621
00:52:11.963 --> 00:52:14.423 line:80%
Isn't it wrong to disrespect me?

622
00:52:15.424 --> 00:52:19.512 line:80%
If someone's kind,
shouldn't you be kind back to them?

623
00:52:21.264 --> 00:52:24.642 line:80%
I'm good to him, and I wait.

624
00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:27.270 line:80%
I keep waiting.

625
00:52:28.688 --> 00:52:30.815 line:80%
Shouldn't he come to his senses?

626
00:52:36.821 --> 00:52:38.698 line:80%
The police agreed to close the case

627
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:41.784 line:80%
as an accident
by a drunk man who stole a truck.

628
00:52:43.202 --> 00:52:45.872 line:80%
Jeong Man-sik and Bae Hui-suk
are in Gyeonggi-do.

629
00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:49.250 line:80%
I'll catch them soon.

630
00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:53.838 line:80%
It's taking too long.
I was so worried that I lost sleep.

631
00:52:56.966 --> 00:52:58.342 line:80%
No loose ends, okay?

632
00:53:17.778 --> 00:53:19.488 line:80%
I'm Head Chef Baek Eun-ho.

633
00:53:20.281 --> 00:53:21.824 line:80%
How was your meal?

634
00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:25.995 line:80%
I heard you wanted to speak with me.

635
00:53:31.417 --> 00:53:34.295 line:80%
The meal was great,
and I wanted to know...

636
00:53:36.047 --> 00:53:37.882 line:80%
how you know Yu Ji-hyuk.

637
00:53:40.593 --> 00:53:41.886 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk?

638
00:53:51.479 --> 00:53:52.563 line:80%
I ought to...

639
00:54:23.344 --> 00:54:25.388 line:80%
OH YU-RA

640
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:02.258 line:80%
You told me to use you anytime.

641
00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:05.011 line:80%
What is this?

642
00:55:13.102 --> 00:55:14.520 line:80%
Open your eyes, Ji-hyuk.

643
00:55:21.569 --> 00:55:22.862 line:80%
I mean...

644
00:55:23.487 --> 00:55:24.864 line:80%
You can't even do that.

645
00:55:32.621 --> 00:55:33.664 line:80%
By the way,

646
00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:37.752 line:80%
I've grown and become much stronger.

647
00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:40.337 line:80%
I'm not the old Kang Ji-won.

648
00:55:42.381 --> 00:55:43.382 line:80%
So...

649
00:55:45.134 --> 00:55:45.968 line:80%
Fate?

650
00:55:46.761 --> 00:55:48.679 line:80%
I'm not scared of it anymore.

651
00:55:54.477 --> 00:55:58.272 line:80%
So I want you to overcome your fate too.

652
00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:05.154 line:80%
I was always alone.

653
00:56:05.946 --> 00:56:10.201 line:80%
So I've counted the days since my mom left

654
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:13.079 line:80%
and since my dad died.

655
00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:16.916 line:80%
But now...

656
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.213 line:80%
I want to count the days of us together.

657
00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:28.886 line:80%
Come back to me.

658
00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:33.224 line:80%
Don't leave me alone.

659
00:56:36.185 --> 00:56:38.062 line:80%
Open your eyes. Please.

660
00:56:42.525 --> 00:56:44.443 line:80%
I want to hear your voice.

661
00:56:45.152 --> 00:56:49.073 line:80%
VOICE MESSAGE

662
00:56:49.156 --> 00:56:52.535 line:80%
I'll tell you something
I didn't expect to tell you like this.

663
00:56:53.994 --> 00:56:56.330 line:80%
I died in 2023.

664
00:57:08.509 --> 00:57:09.468 line:80%
I like you.

665
00:57:12.054 --> 00:57:13.180 line:80%
I like you.

666
00:57:14.014 --> 00:57:15.641 line:80%
I like you so much.

667
00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:20.020 line:80%
I like you too.

668
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:22.898 line:80%
So...

669
00:57:23.816 --> 00:57:24.859 line:80%
I'm sorry.

670
00:58:13.574 --> 00:58:14.867 line:80%
I love you.

671
00:58:19.705 --> 00:58:21.373 line:80%
I love you too.

672
00:59:06.335 --> 00:59:08.796 line:80%
I think my fate moved to Ms. Yang.

673
00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:10.047 line:80%
What's going on?

674
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:12.800 line:80%
If you touch her, I'll make you pay!

675
00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:14.927 line:80%
Oh Yu-ra must be looking for them.

676
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.804 line:80%
It's a matter of who's faster.

677
00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:18.931 line:80%
It's my first time seeing someone die.

678
00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:21.767 line:80%
Hello, my name's Jeong Su-min.

679
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:24.812 line:80%
Kang Ji-won came to work
as if nothing happened.

680
00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:27.856 line:80%
If she has 80 billion won,
I shouldn't kill her.

681
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.316 line:80%
If I seduce her again,

682
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.694 line:80%
that 80 billion won will come to me.

683
00:59:31.777 --> 00:59:33.237 line:80%
Because Min-hwan

684
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.699 line:80%
must have an affair
and not care if his wife dies.

685
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:40.411 line:80%
Ji-hyuk, I have to seduce Min-hwan.

686
00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:48.919 line:80%
