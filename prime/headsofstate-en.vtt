00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:14.916 line:83%
-Yeah.
-Enjoy this.

162
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.958 line:83%
And use it as a bonding opportunity
with the prime minister.

163
00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:20.500 line:83%
Please.

164
00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:23.875 line:83%
Don't tell me you're still mad
about the fish and chips thing.

165
00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.291 line:83%
He endorsed my opponent
in the heat of the campaign.

166
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.250 line:83%
He had lunch with the guy.
It's hardly an endorsement.

167
00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:30.166 line:83%
Wasn't just lunch. It was fish and chips.

168
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.166 line:83%
Look, you got off on the wrong foot.

169
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.750 line:83%
-Sam's not a bad guy.
-It's not about bad or good.

170
00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.291 line:83%
He doesn't respect me.

171
00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:40.791 line:83%
This is where you're supposed
to say, "Yes, he does."

172
00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:42.875 line:83%
-He respects you.
-Way too late.

173
00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.625 line:83%
Is a man who got 83 million votes
from the American people

174
00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:47.458 line:83%
not feeling properly respected?

175
00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:51.041 line:83%
See you tomorrow.

176
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:54.708 line:83%
Did you look over your speech?

177
00:10:54.791 --> 00:10:56.000 line:83%
Yeah. It's solid.

178
00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:57.083 line:83%
I'll hit it with some fireworks.

179
00:10:57.166 --> 00:10:58.166 line:83%
It'll crackle.

180
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.541 line:83%
It's gonna be a good morning.

181
00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:01.083 line:83%
Won't be that simple.

182
00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:02.333 line:83%
Tell me.

183
00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:04.666 line:83%
Sideways op, Spain.

184
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:07.875 line:83%
-Who was the target?
-[Quincy] Viktor Gradov.

185
00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.875 line:83%
Russian-born arms dealer turned extremist.

186
00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.833 line:83%
Right. Black market weapons developer

187
00:11:12.916 --> 00:11:15.750 line:83%
who got his hands on enriched plutonium
a few years back.

188
00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:17.500 line:83%
Yeah, that's when we took him
out of business.

189
00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:21.875 line:83%
Destroyed his manufacturing plant
with the help of a NATO task force.

190
00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.000 line:83%
We launched an air strike,
destroyed his whole facility.

191
00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:26.666 line:83%
After that, Gradov went off the grid.

192
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.625 line:83%
[Simone]
Spain was our first chance

193
00:11:28.708 --> 00:11:30.458 line:83%
to move on Gradov in two years.

194
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:32.041 line:83%
Where is he now?

195
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.166 line:83%
In the wind.

196
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.833 line:83%
NSA is scraping border entries
and airport screenings for noise.

197
00:11:36.916 --> 00:11:38.875 line:83%
[Quincy] Intelligence and Research
didn't have the chance

198
00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.291 line:83%
-to do their usual analysis.
-Bloody hell.

199
00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:41.583 line:83%
How many times I've got to say it?

200
00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:44.458 line:83%
We do not leapfrog intel.

201
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.416 line:83%
About Noel, if you want to talk...

202
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.250 line:83%
I don't.

203
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.291 line:83%
[Derringer] We should warn Clarke's team
about Jack Gordon.

204
00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:52.958 line:83%
Jack always goes for the jugular,

205
00:11:53.041 --> 00:11:55.208 line:83%
and he will fry us over this Spain thing.

206
00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:57.083 line:83%
Did you tell
the president's comms director

207
00:11:57.166 --> 00:11:59.166 line:83%
that he must stick to the script?

208
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.375 line:83%
-Yes.
-Good.

209
00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:03.333 line:83%
Hopefully he doesn't start writing checks
that we can't cash.

210
00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:04.916 line:83%
He still hasn't figured out
the difference between

211
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.125 line:83%
a press conference and a press junket.

212
00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:08.416 line:83%
Oh.

213
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.791 line:83%
-Mr. Prime Minister.
-Mr. President.

214
00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:14.458 line:83%
Yeah. We finally meet.

215
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.083 line:83%
You know, it was a shame
that you missed the inauguration.

216
00:12:17.166 --> 00:12:18.875 line:83%
It was a hell of a show.

217
00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.541 line:83%
-Sure it was.
-Yeah.

218
00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:21.833 line:83%
Well...

219
00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.000 line:83%
Shall we?

220
00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:25.583 line:83%
Uh, wait, wait.

221
00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:28.000 line:83%
We should savor this moment.

222
00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:30.916 line:83%
I mean, this is... it's our debut duet.

223
00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.166 line:83%
-Duet?
-Yeah.

224
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.791 line:83%
It's like I'm Dr. Dre and you're Eminem,

225
00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:36.541 line:83%
and we're taking that stage
for the first time together.

226
00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.583 line:83%
I'm Eminem?

227
00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:43.125 line:83%
Listen, um, about this terrible situation

228
00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:44.416 line:83%
-in Spain.
-Mm-hmm?

229
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.041 line:83%
If it comes up out there,
I'd just steer clear of it.

230
00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:48.875 line:83%
-Let's just punt it.
-Punt it?

231
00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.541 line:83%
-Yeah.
-To where?

232
00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:53.458 line:83%
Well, to later.

233
00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:56.375 line:83%
Today's about NATO,
clean energy, light and bright stuff.

234
00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:58.291 line:83%
Light and bright. Okay.

235
00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:00.875 line:83%
You want to warm up together?

236
00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.000 line:83%
Do some breathing exercises?

237
00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:03.791 line:83%
I'm already breathing.

238
00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:05.458 line:83%
-Roger that. Well...
-Yeah.

239
00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:06.875 line:83%
[laughs] Let's dance, I guess.

240
00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.625 line:83%
Hey, uh, just do us both
a favor out there.

241
00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:11.166 line:83%
No questions from Jack Gordon.

242
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.875 line:83%
My guy.

243
00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:18.375 line:83%
-[cameras clicking and beeping]
-And as of today,

244
00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:20.958 line:83%
thanks to this revolutionary
new technology

245
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:22.791 line:83%
developed by both of our great nations,

246
00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:24.750 line:83%
we are now partners in energy.

247
00:13:24.833 --> 00:13:28.125 line:83%
The pebble-bed reactor is not just
an investment in clean energy.

248
00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.208 line:83%
It's also an investment in security.

249
00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:33.000 line:83%
Energy security is national security.

250
00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:35.458 line:83%
It is also an investment in job creation.

251
00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:37.041 line:83%
A whole lot of jobs.

252
00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:38.875 line:83%
And we no longer
have to deal with the Russians,

253
00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.125 line:83%
the Saudis or the Venezuelans on oil.

254
00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:44.166 line:83%
But we are keen to present
this global initiative

255
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.083 line:83%
to our NATO partners in the coming days.

256
00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:49.458 line:83%
Okay. Questions?

257
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:51.916 line:83%
-[reporters clamoring]
-[man] President Derringer!

258
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.708 line:83%
Uh, it's just been announced
that
Water Cobra

259
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.250 line:83%
is being expanded
into a cinematic universe.

260
00:13:56.333 --> 00:13:58.625 line:83%
Any chance you'll be making a cameo?

261
00:13:58.708 --> 00:14:00.083 line:83%
Oh, folks. [chuckles]

262
00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:01.541 line:83%
I promised the first lady

263
00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.500 line:83%
if I ever dressed up
as the Venom in Denim again,

264
00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:04.916 line:83%
it'd either be in the Oval boudoir

265
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.375 line:83%
or for the White House
Correspondents' Dinner,

266
00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:08.041 line:83%
and you're only invited to the last one.

267
00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:09.875 line:83%
-[laughter]
-Prime Minister Clarke.

268
00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.625 line:83%
-Yes?
-
The Daily Mail
have photos

269
00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:13.250 line:83%
of the duchess and a new beau.

270
00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:16.458 line:83%
Any comments about your ex-girlfriend's
latest escapades?

271
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:18.166 line:83%
Okay. Who has a real question?

272
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.375 line:83%
Hey, hold on a minute.

273
00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:22.000 line:83%
Now, who else is tired of seeing
the prime minister as a single man?

274
00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:23.291 line:83%
I'll tell you what.

275
00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:24.666 line:83%
How about we get him
his own season of
The Bachelor
?

276
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.708 line:83%
-Who's with me?
-[laughter]

277
00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:27.583 line:83%
-[excited chatter]
-[man] Yeah! Let's do it!

278
00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:29.666 line:83%
Jack Gordon.

279
00:14:31.666 --> 00:14:35.291 line:83%
There are six dead British and Americans
in Spain this morning.

280
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.500 line:83%
Can you comment on speculation
this is the result

281
00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:42.041 line:83%
of a failed covert operation to capture
known arms dealer Viktor Gradov?

282
00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:46.166 line:83%
Covert operations are covert for a reason.

283
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.000 line:83%
That's all I'm gonna say on that.

284
00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:50.625 line:83%
That and Gradov's gonna wish
we caught him yesterday.

285
00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:52.708 line:83%
Because when we do get our hands on him,

286
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.958 line:83%
he is going to be forming
a special relationship

287
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:56.958 line:83%
with the concept of retribution.

288
00:14:57.041 --> 00:15:00.125 line:83%
We should also be using this
as a collective moment of introspection,

289
00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:02.916 line:83%
find out what went wrong
and learn from it.

290
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000 line:83%
Leaks indicate that Echelon
was accessed during the op.

291
00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:10.000 line:83%
Are you ready to acknowledge the existence
of a top secret surveillance program

292
00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:13.791 line:83%
which monitors all of our emails,
video conferences, phone calls...

293
00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:15.250 line:83%
Tom.

294
00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:17.583 line:83%
There's only so many times
I can say "no comment" to that.

295
00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:19.041 line:83%
I'll comment.

296
00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:20.750 line:83%
Our enemies should be afraid.

297
00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:23.666 line:83%
We have the tools
and we have the technology

298
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.250 line:83%
to find and destroy them
if they challenge us.

299
00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.166 line:83%
[Clarke] We aren't making
any promises except that

300
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.541 line:83%
we will work tirelessly to get results.

301
00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:31.833 line:83%
Well, we are.

302
00:15:31.916 --> 00:15:34.375 line:83%
The United States of America
is promising results.

303
00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:36.250 line:83%
[Gordon clears throat]
President Derringer,

304
00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:39.625 line:83%
do you have a message for the families
of the men and women killed in Spain?

305
00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:42.166 line:83%
I've spent a lot of time
with Special Forces.

306
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.333 line:83%
Trained with them, learned from them.

307
00:15:44.416 --> 00:15:46.583 line:83%
And what I have to say is
we must do better.

308
00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:48.583 line:83%
We will do better.

309
00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:50.958 line:83%
When you say, um, "trained with them,"

310
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:53.833 line:83%
-that was for an acting role, yes?
-[light laughter]

311
00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:55.166 line:83%
Yes, but, uh...

312
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.833 line:83%
I mean, y-you've never served.

313
00:15:56.916 --> 00:15:59.416 line:83%
As someone who did serve
in the British Army,

314
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.708 line:83%
as most of you know,

315
00:16:00.791 --> 00:16:03.000 line:83%
if I did have something to say
to the families,

316
