1
00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:41.584 line:80%
I used to always pick a bad hand.

2
00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.711 line:80%
Crap...

3
00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.674 line:80%
Bring Mom.

4
00:00:48.758 --> 00:00:52.219 line:80%
When a couple fights,
the husband should reach out first.

5
00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:55.306 line:80%
Oh, it's working.

6
00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.520 line:80%
Do you need anything?

7
00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:02.855 line:80%
I'll get it for you.

8
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.489 line:80%
My dad was hard-working
but struggled to make ends meet.

9
00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.450 line:80%
I always felt sad and bad for him.

10
00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:19.330 line:80%
Just get a new car.

11
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.416 line:80%
This one sounds like
a 100-year-old grandpa coughing.

12
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.585 line:80%
She can hear you!

13
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.295 line:80%
Don't be so heartless.

14
00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:28.255 line:80%
I'm afraid it's dangerous.

15
00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:30.800 line:80%
This baby won't put me in danger.

16
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.968 line:80%
You'll be alone without me.

17
00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.140 line:80%
Drive safe.

18
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.769 line:80%
Are you coming at night?

19
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.271 line:80%
I'll be pretty late.

20
00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:45.981 line:80%
Check the doors before bed!

21
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.503 line:80%
Who would steal anything from us?

22
00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:16.262 line:80%
There you go.

23
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:17.429 line:80%
Go on now.

24
00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:18.514 line:80%
Bye.

25
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.519 line:80%
She's pretty. Just like her mom.

26
00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:26.355 line:80%
So what? Her mom ran away.

27
00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:30.526 line:80%
Mr. Kang shouldn't have married her
for her pretty face.

28
00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.237 line:80%
-I feel sorry for that poor kid.
-Stop it.

29
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.322 line:80%
The poor kid whose mom ran away.

30
00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:41.996 line:80%
In this tiny little neighborhood,
people talked about us to pass the time.

31
00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:47.209 line:80%
And it hurt me more
because I was going through puberty.

32
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.171 line:80%
Dad...

33
00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:55.718 line:80%
Where's he going?

34
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.149 line:80%
It's raining. Shall we rent a video?

35
00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:12.735 line:80%
-Shall we have some
ramyeon
too?
-Sounds great.

36
00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:14.445 line:80%
I'll go rent it.

37
00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:16.822 line:80%
-Hurry back.
-Okay.

38
00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:24.079 line:80%
Mom?

39
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.280 line:80%
To carry on,
I had to accept that it was just my life.

40
00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:01.909 line:80%
That my life was just one
of the awful ones.

41
00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:05.996 line:80%
That there was no reason
that I shouldn't be

42
00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.124 line:80%
one of the unlucky ones.

43
00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:13.712 line:80%
It's 1,200 won.

44
00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:25.891 line:80%
Did you lose your wallet?

45
00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:30.229 line:80%
Goodness. You make it so obvious
that your mother ran away.

46
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.481 line:80%
Because of your mother,

47
00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.776 line:80%
you must act smart
so others won't find fault with you.

48
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.528 line:80%
You know that, right?

49
00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.488 line:80%
Don't be so nosy.

50
00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.914 line:80%
Here.

51
00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:50.290 line:80%
Is it yours?

52
00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.636 line:80%
So anything was good.

53
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:07.558 line:80%
I was desperate to feel a hand
reaching out to me.

54
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:10.185 line:80%
JEONG SU-MIN

55
00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:11.353 line:80%
What?

56
00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.605 line:80%
Those brats...

57
00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:14.690 line:80%
I'll punish you!

58
00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:19.069 line:80%
Too desperate to judge
whether it was land or swamp.

59
00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:22.573 line:80%
But

60
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:27.077 line:80%
I was determined not to do it again
with my second chance.

61
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.416 line:80%
I was going to fight, grow,

62
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.294 line:80%
and become happier than anyone else.

63
00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:40.716 line:80%
It was finally my turn
to pick a good hand.

64
00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.600 line:80%
I picked a good hand this time.

65
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.019 line:80%
I believed I'd be happy.

66
00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.694 line:80%
I called to talk,
but you wouldn't pick up.

67
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.447 line:80%
I thought about coming back later.

68
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.785 line:80%
But you might keep dodging my calls,
so I waited to see you.

69
00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:11.789 line:80%
Ji-won.

70
00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:14.166 line:80%
I can explain this.

71
00:06:32.768 --> 00:06:37.314 line:80%
I was wrong. I still only pick bad hands.

72
00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:46.865 line:80%
EPISODE 12

73
00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:12.683 line:80%
BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL
MARRY MY HUSBAND
BY SUNGSOJAK

74
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.769 line:80%
Hui-yeon, I'm sorry...

75
00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:17.646 line:80%
Ms. Kang, what do we do?

76
00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:19.731 line:80%
Just now,

77
00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:22.985 line:80%
I called Ms. Yang
because she didn't show up.

78
00:07:25.863 --> 00:07:28.615 line:80%
What do we do?
Ms. Yang has stomach cancer.

79
00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.629 line:80%
That's why life's hard.

80
00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:44.131 line:80%
The future's a mystery.

81
00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:53.682 line:80%
I thought I'd knew everything
at this age when I was a kid.

82
00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:56.185 line:80%
No, you're doing great.

83
00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:01.481 line:80%
I read your column in the company paper
about that unfortunate incident.

84
00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:05.944 line:80%
The staff could've been shaken.
It was the appropriate response.

85
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.031 line:80%
I was proud.

86
00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:13.660 line:80%
And I felt bad for asking you
to clean up my employee's mess.

87
00:08:13.744 --> 00:08:16.788 line:80%
We're like family.
It's the least I could do.

88
00:08:16.872 --> 00:08:19.082 line:80%
My father always told me

89
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:22.002 line:80%
not to forget that U&K was my family.

90
00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:27.549 line:80%
I've never thought differently.

91
00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:29.509 line:80%
Gang-cheol's so lucky.

92
00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:31.470 line:80%
He's raised you well.

93
00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:38.101 line:80%
If you feel that way, I shouldn't have
broken off the engagement.

94
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.814 line:80%
We got engaged because of our parents,

95
00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:45.609 line:80%
and Ji-hyuk was so apathetic.

96
00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.820 line:80%
And I never liked him as a man.

97
00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:53.033 line:80%
That's why I agreed
to break off the engagement.

98
00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.328 line:80%
But he's become charming.

99
00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.831 line:80%
What's happened?

100
00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:10.509 line:80%
So I'm going to stay in Korea
for quite a while.

101
00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.973 line:80%
Can I do that?

102
00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.016 line:80%
I'll come and see you often.

103
00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.562 line:80%
How would it feel to have my boyfriend
marry my best friend?

104
00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:28.443 line:80%
Would I feel lucky
since I got a new rich boyfriend?

105
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.365 line:80%
It's like a soap, isn't it?

106
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.551 line:80%
You bought a car
to take me to the hospital.

107
00:09:54.136 --> 00:09:55.929 line:80%
How long since you last drove?

108
00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.643 line:80%
How were the test results?

109
00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.605 line:80%
It's not going to be easy.

110
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.985 line:80%
I have to wait long
because the doctor's schedule is full.

111
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.824 line:80%
Still, medicine's gotten
so much better, so...

112
00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:28.670 line:80%
I hate this.

113
00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:33.216 line:80%
I get weak if I'm with you.

114
00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:36.887 line:80%
I can endure it if I'm alone.

115
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:52.569 line:80%
That's exactly why I follow you around.

116
00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.865 line:80%
You can't be mentally healthy
when you're in pain.

117
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.204 line:80%
Cry.

118
00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:05.999 line:80%
Don't hold it back. Just cry in my arms.

119
00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:08.377 line:80%
You have to cry.

120
00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.885 line:80%
Why are you so good to me?

121
00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:24.142 line:80%
It's my fault.

122
00:11:24.226 --> 00:11:26.436 line:80%
My fate went to her.

123
00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.439 line:80%
But why?

124
00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:32.025 line:80%
This doesn't end with Min-hwan's marriage?

125
00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:48.166 line:80%
Hey.

126
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.751 line:80%
Stop glaring.

127
00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:52.796 line:80%
You should've told my mom
if you hated this place.

128
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.925 line:80%
How can I tell her?
You should've told her for me.

129
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:57.843 line:80%
Why would I?

130
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.512 line:80%
I think my mom's right.

131
00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.056 line:80%
It's dangerous
for a pregnant woman to fly.

132
00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:08.520 line:80%
All right. Fine.

133
00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:11.273 line:80%
The honeymoon isn't important.

134
00:12:16.153 --> 00:12:18.697 line:80%
Min-hwan.

135
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.826 line:80%
Let's live a good life, okay?
You're the head of our house now.

136
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.077 line:80%
-The baby--
-Hey!

137
00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:26.455 line:80%
Why am I the head?

138
00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.206 line:80%
Ji-won never said that.

139
00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:42.387 line:80%
Su-min.

140
00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:46.850 line:80%
You're great and all,
but you don't know marriage.

141
00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.769 line:80%
Listen carefully.

142
00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:55.275 line:80%
Marriages work well
when each spouse does their own job.

143
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:57.444 line:80%
What?

144
00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.905 line:80%
You didn't like the wedding invitation,

145
00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:03.617 line:80%
didn't understand Mom,
and hated the honeymoon destination,

146
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.327 line:80%
You keep complaining to me.

147
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:09.039 line:80%
That's because
you only think about yourself.

148
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.582 line:80%
Look at me.

149
00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:14.002 line:80%
Did I say anything
about your friends who caused a scene

150
00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.170 line:80%
at our wedding?

151
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.131 line:80%
You were upset and threw your phone at me.

152
00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:19.257 line:80%
Hey!

153
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.551 line:80%
Are they the same thing?

154
00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.262 line:80%
There's no use talking to you...

155
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.931 line:80%
Forget it.

156
00:13:27.933 --> 00:13:29.267 line:80%
Damn it.

157
00:13:33.522 --> 00:13:35.106 line:80%
Congratulations

158
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.194 line:80%
on picking up my trash.

159
00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:43.657 line:80%
No.

160
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.789 line:80%
Hey, Sang-jong. Has it been rented out?

161
00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.333 line:80%
Yeah, I just wired the money.

162
00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:54.668 line:80%
-Thank you.
-Bye.

163
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:55.752 line:80%
Okay.

164
00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:00.590 line:80%
But is it really okay to tell your mom
you were scammed?

165
00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.425 line:80%
Even if she falls for it,

166
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.970 line:80%
won't your wife throw a fit about it?

167
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:08.014 line:80%
I'm her only son. She won't kill me.

168
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.810 line:80%
And it wasn't my wife's money,
so what can she do?

169
00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:12.894 line:80%
Hold on.

170
00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.690 line:80%
YU SANG-JONG: 360 MILLION WON

171
00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.985 line:80%
Okay, I got the money!

172
00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.572 line:80%
Debts are assets too. It'll be okay.

173
00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:25.282 line:80%
Okay, thanks. Bye!

174
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.951 line:80%
Oh, my God!

175
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.039 line:80%
What were you talking about?

176
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:35.792 line:80%
What?

177
00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:39.170 line:80%
What do you mean? What did you hear?

178
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.298 line:80%
What did you mean?

179
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.800 line:80%
You said it wasn't my money!

180
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.721 line:80%
Well...

181
00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.727 line:80%
It'll be released soon.
This puts us in a spot.

182
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.230 line:80%
They even checked the draft.
How could they back out now?

183
00:14:57.314 --> 00:14:59.441 line:80%
You can't do this before the launch.

184
00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:00.525 line:80%
This is insane.

185
00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.069 line:80%
Wait! Wait a second!

186
00:15:07.324 --> 00:15:09.951 line:80%
What is it, Hui-yeon?

187
00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.786 line:80%
Are things not going well

188
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.832 line:80%
with the project the respected Ms. Yang
and Ms. Kang are working on?

189
00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.255 line:80%
-Tae-hyeong.
-Yes?

190
00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:25.383 line:80%
Don't hold onto a hopeless project.

191
00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.638 line:80%
Let's go smoke, okay?

192
00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.475 line:80%
Yeah, let's go.

193
00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.393 line:80%
Keep working, okay?

194
00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:39.564 line:80%
It's 1:45 p.m.

195
00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:44.653 line:80%
You took three and a half days off,
and you show up to work now?

196
00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.696 line:80%
You act so meticulous at work,

197
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.908 line:80%
but you're more meticulous
about your free time.

198
00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:51.618 line:80%
Mr. Kim?

199
00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.205 line:80%
Yes, Ms. Kang?

200
00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:58.625 line:80%
You must be going somewhere far
to smoke during work hours.

201
00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.960 line:80%
Since Ms. Yang is away,

202
00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:04.923 line:80%
you should help with the meal kit,
but you don't review the data.

203
00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.883 line:80%
Oh, that?

204
00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:10.345 line:80%
I don't need to review it. That's why.

205
00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:13.723 line:80%
Tae-hyeong, let's go.

206
00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:19.270 line:80%
The chefs suddenly
canceled their contracts? Why?

207
00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:24.943 line:80%
What?

208
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.654 line:80%
What's with Chef Lee Gwang-min?

209
00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.948 line:80%
We're about to release. Why postpone?

210
00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:35.328 line:80%
He says the product's of poor quality.
Honestly, it's ridiculous.

211
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.581 line:80%
I think something's up. Kim Gyeong-uk...

212
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:43.586 line:80%
I mean, Mr. Kim is good at politics.

213
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.756 line:80%
He has connections.
I think he did something.

214
00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:50.677 line:80%
What about Ms. Yang?

215
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.181 line:80%
I took her home.
I think she should take time off.

216
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:56.891 line:80%
Time off...

217
00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.955 line:80%
It's not time for me to be angry.

218
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.666 line:80%
But you won't hear me out,

219
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.377 line:80%
and you made me
call you like this at work.

220
00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.589 line:80%
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.883 line:80%
I needed time to sort my thoughts.

222
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:35.847 line:80%
I was confused.

223
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.186 line:80%
I was given another chance,

224
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:47.776 line:80%
and I thought I just had to get
Min-hwan and Su-min to marry.

225
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:52.280 line:80%
While I was doing it, you were...

226
00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.284 line:80%
like a gift to me.

227
00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.511 line:80%
Did you ever hear that I was married?

228
00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:27.524 line:80%
It gets sorted out in a few years anyway.
I just sped up the process.

229
00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:30.985 line:80%
Yu-ra's a family friend
since we were kids.

230
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:35.573 line:80%
I thought I could marry her
without any feelings.

231
00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.494 line:80%
But that wasn't the case,
so I ended it with her.

232
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.499 line:80%
You can marry someone
without any feelings?

233
00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:47.919 line:80%
Such relationships exist.

234
00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:57.554 line:80%
To be honest,

235
00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:03.810 line:80%
I didn't know how I felt about you
before your funeral.

236
00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:07.730 line:80%
So I ended it when I got back.

237
00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:09.732 line:80%
That's all.

238
00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.409 line:80%
I don't know.

239
00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:24.706 line:80%
Everything you say
just sounds like an excuse to me.

240
00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.083 line:80%
Ji-won.

241
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.002 line:80%
I'm not trying to blame you.

242
00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:31.546 line:80%
I just...

243
00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.843 line:80%
I realized I dreamed of something

244
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.304 line:80%
too happy.

245
00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.558 line:80%
At the lake,

246
00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:47.061 line:80%
you told me

247
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.190 line:80%
having a family was a good thing.

248
00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.987 line:80%
Do you know what it means
to not have a family?

249
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.867 line:80%
I wanted to start a family.

250
00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.874 line:80%
Yes, I made a mistake.

251
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.131 line:80%
My mom...

252
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.011 line:80%
left home when I was 14.

253
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.265 line:80%
She found love.

254
00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:31.564 line:80%
She endured for 14 years
because of me, but...

255
00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:34.400 line:80%
No matter how long you endure,

256
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.658 line:80%
those left behind...

257
00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:46.120 line:80%
get hurt.

258
00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:01.803 line:80%
No matter what the relationship is,
once it's started,

259
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:05.431 line:80%
I don't think it's right for one person

260
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.017 line:80%
to end it one-sidedly.

261
00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:33.501 line:80%
I recruited Dr. Lee to our cancer ward
from the States.

262
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.586 line:80%
She specializes in stomach cancer.

263
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.463 line:80%
YUIL MEDICAL CENTER
DR. LEE HYEON-JI

264
00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:40.675 line:80%
I spent half a year on this.

265
00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.552 line:80%
Ms. Yang will receive

266
00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.180 line:80%
surgery as soon as possible.

267
00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:26.971 line:80%
Hello?

268
00:22:34.312 --> 00:22:39.025 line:80%
I hate clichés like this,
but I guess I can't help it.

269
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:42.445 line:80%
Thanks for coming.

270
00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:54.874 line:80%
I thought it was only right
to talk to you, so I came.

271
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:57.085 line:80%
There's nothing to worry--

272
00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:59.712 line:80%
That's not for you to decide, is it?

273
00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:02.840 line:80%
It bothers me.

274
00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:07.720 line:80%
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:12.350 line:80%
I didn't know he was engaged.

276
00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:16.562 line:80%
And I'm going to stop seeing him.

277
00:23:19.857 --> 00:23:24.612 line:80%
In life, there are times
when you accidently stab someone.

278
00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:29.617 line:80%
But saying you didn't know
and will never do it again

279
00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:31.327 line:80%
doesn't cut it.

280
00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:39.794 line:80%
What do you want me to do?

281
00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:43.214 line:80%
I liked him.

282
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:47.718 line:80%
I didn't mean to, but I fell for him.

283
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:53.141 line:80%
So I had a happy dream for a moment.

284
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:57.854 line:80%
However, after I found out about you,

285
00:23:58.604 --> 00:23:59.730 line:80%
I ended it.

286
00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:01.357 line:80%
I didn't know how I felt...

287
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:04.360 line:80%
So I ended it when I got back.

288
00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:10.741 line:80%
That's interesting that you fell for him.

289
00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:15.538 line:80%
Didn't you have a boyfriend
of seven years?

290
00:24:16.831 --> 00:24:19.709 line:80%
You were practically married to him.

291
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:25.840 line:80%
Why did you suddenly fall for your boss?

292
00:24:25.923 --> 00:24:27.550 line:80%
After seven years of working.

293
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:36.392 line:80%
Because Ji-hyuk's U&K's successor?

294
00:24:37.351 --> 00:24:39.729 line:80%
-It's not like that.
-Then you didn't know?

295
00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:45.109 line:80%
My grandfather knew...

296
00:24:45.193 --> 00:24:46.319 line:80%
...promoted to CEO...

297
00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:47.778 line:80%
...that I just

298
00:24:48.362 --> 00:24:50.656 line:80%
didn't want anything.

299
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.159 line:80%
My life was decided since birth.

300
00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:57.872 line:80%
So I studied and worked only for U&K.

301
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:05.213 line:80%
So you knew.

302
00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:10.301 line:80%
I think we're done.

303
00:25:10.384 --> 00:25:11.594 line:80%
If you'll excuse me.

304
00:25:16.349 --> 00:25:18.100 line:80%
What I hate the most

305
00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:20.186 line:80%
are people like you.

306
00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:24.148 line:80%
Self-righteous nobodies.

307
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:26.359 line:80%
You were greedy but say you weren't.

308
00:25:27.193 --> 00:25:30.279 line:80%
You know everything but pretend you don't.

309
00:25:35.117 --> 00:25:38.412 line:80%
You're not dumb enough to not know

310
00:25:38.913 --> 00:25:40.539 line:80%
he could change your life.

311
00:25:51.384 --> 00:25:52.510 line:80%
How predictable.

312
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.974 line:80%
You're the type of person I hate as well.

313
00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:03.271 line:80%
Do you think everyone's like you?

314
00:26:04.814 --> 00:26:08.776 line:80%
You think it was important to me
that he was U&K's successor?

315
00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:12.780 line:80%
It didn't matter to me at all.

316
00:26:19.287 --> 00:26:20.371 line:80%
Because...

317
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:24.667 line:80%
my life changed without him.

318
00:27:19.055 --> 00:27:20.306 line:80%
I need to get a grip.

319
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.656 line:80%
If the cancer went to Yang Ju-ran...

320
00:27:43.537 --> 00:27:44.705 line:80%
Wait...

321
00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:50.169 line:80%
What happens now?

322
00:27:53.464 --> 00:27:54.590 line:80%
-Open the door.
-Okay.

323
00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:04.266 line:80%
Say bye to your mom.

324
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:07.186 line:80%
Say bye. Bye.

325
00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:09.814 line:80%
Princess.

326
00:28:09.897 --> 00:28:12.233 line:80%
Don't come here anymore. Rest at home.

327
00:28:12.817 --> 00:28:15.694 line:80%
Okay? Go on now.

328
00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:19.281 line:80%
I'm Lee Jae-won, Ju-ran's husband.

329
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:23.244 line:80%
I have stomach cancer.

330
00:28:26.997 --> 00:28:28.958 line:80%
What am I doing right now?

331
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.341 line:80%
Let's go.

332
00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:39.343 line:80%
Are you cold?

333
00:28:48.018 --> 00:28:49.311 line:80%
Go inside first.

334
00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:51.897 line:80%
-What?
-Your lips.

335
00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:53.190 line:80%
Husband...

336
00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:55.067 line:80%
Husband...

337
00:28:56.235 --> 00:29:01.282 line:80%
What if the fate has something to do
with the husband, not marrying Min-hwan?

338
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:08.539 line:80%
I went to see Dr. Lee.

339
00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:12.710 line:80%
I made treatment appointments.
I can get surgery soon too.

340
00:29:13.252 --> 00:29:16.464 line:80%
I don't know why,
but she always left one spot open.

341
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.382 line:80%
She specializes in stomach cancer.

342
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:22.052 line:80%
I spent half a year on this.

343
00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:31.812 line:80%
What? A scam?

344
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:36.775 line:80%
-I'll kill that real estate agent.
-No, Mom!

345
00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:40.237 line:80%
I took care of it. I spoke to her, Mom.

346
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:41.906 line:80%
What did you take care of?

347
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:45.201 line:80%
Why are you on your knees here if you did?

348
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.412 line:80%
When I think about it, Su-min is

349
00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:50.456 line:80%
different from me.

350
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:52.166 line:80%
Right.

351
00:29:52.249 --> 00:29:55.711 line:80%
If you think about it,
this is all your fault.

352
00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:57.546 line:80%
What does a man know?

353
00:29:58.506 --> 00:30:01.342 line:80%
This is why a good woman
needs to join the family.

354
00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:04.803 line:80%
I shouldn't have been so hasty.

355
00:30:04.887 --> 00:30:07.139 line:80%
I felt strangely hesitant about this.

356
00:30:08.057 --> 00:30:09.475 line:80%
It felt wrong.

357
00:30:13.521 --> 00:30:16.190 line:80%
Although she married Min-hwan like me,

358
00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:20.027 line:80%
would she just let them
walk all over her like me?

359
00:30:25.616 --> 00:30:26.867 line:80%
Mother.

360
00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:30.746 line:80%
You should get the facts straight.

361
00:30:32.248 --> 00:30:35.960 line:80%
You picked the house
and gave him money to sign the contract.

362
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:37.962 line:80%
Why are you blaming me?

363
00:30:42.383 --> 00:30:47.680 line:80%
I mean, after I let it slide that he was
renting a house, not buying one.

364
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.724 line:80%
Goodness.

365
00:30:50.808 --> 00:30:54.436 line:80%
Listen to you! I've been nice to you
since you're pregnant.

366
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.773 line:80%
You didn't bring anything,
but what? You let it slide?

367
00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:01.068 line:80%
I have money.
He said to not bring anything.

368
00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:05.739 line:80%
I guess it's because
he wanted to move in here...

369
00:31:05.823 --> 00:31:07.366 line:80%
Hey.

370
00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:10.160 line:80%
You're a contract employee. What money?

371
00:31:10.244 --> 00:31:13.622 line:80%
Contract employee?
You said she'd work after giving birth.

372
00:31:15.708 --> 00:31:17.209 line:80%
She will.

373
00:31:17.293 --> 00:31:19.920 line:80%
She's a competent contract employee.

374
00:31:20.004 --> 00:31:21.213 line:80%
I did stocks.

375
00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:23.591 line:80%
-What?
-I earned quite a lot.

376
00:31:23.674 --> 00:31:24.842 line:80%
What?

377
00:31:27.636 --> 00:31:31.098 line:80%
I'm not excited about this at all either.

378
00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:35.769 line:80%
And let's be honest. I did everything
you wanted for the wedding.

379
00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:38.981 line:80%
And during the honeymoon,
I learned of his--

380
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:40.524 line:80%
Hush!

381
00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:50.951 line:80%
In any case, stop hitting Min-hwan.

382
00:31:54.955 --> 00:31:57.625 line:80%
He's the head of the household
and our baby's dad.

383
00:31:57.708 --> 00:32:00.294 line:80%
Or shall I just leave
with our baby general?

384
00:32:05.049 --> 00:32:06.133 line:80%
Our baby...

385
00:32:07.468 --> 00:32:08.636 line:80%
Here it is.

386
00:32:11.847 --> 00:32:14.433 line:80%
Marriage isn't all that bad, right?

387
00:32:14.975 --> 00:32:16.018 line:80%
I gained an ally.

388
00:32:18.187 --> 00:32:19.396 line:80%
Don't worry.

389
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.898 line:80%
My mom can be harsh,

390
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:22.107 line:80%
but she's cool.

391
00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:24.735 line:80%
Once our baby's born,
she'll buy us a house!

392
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:27.655 line:80%
Once she hears the baby crying,

393
00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:29.156 line:80%
she can't withstand it.

394
00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:30.282 line:80%
There's no baby.

395
00:32:35.245 --> 00:32:38.040 line:80%
What? No what? What did you say?

396
00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:41.293 line:80%
My God!

397
00:32:44.338 --> 00:32:45.798 line:80%
I'll be home later.

398
00:32:45.881 --> 00:32:48.050 line:80%
Make sure the house is clean.

399
00:32:50.052 --> 00:32:51.970 line:80%
I can't believe this is my life.

400
00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:55.432 line:80%
I have two more mouths to feed at my age.

401
00:32:55.516 --> 00:32:58.102 line:80%
God, such nuisances.

402
00:32:58.185 --> 00:32:59.269 line:80%
Darn it...

403
00:33:06.652 --> 00:33:08.570 line:80%
What do you mean?

404
00:33:08.654 --> 00:33:09.780 line:80%
There's no what?

405
00:33:11.407 --> 00:33:12.408 line:80%
I...

406
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:17.788 line:80%
had a miscarriage.

407
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:28.799 line:80%
When you threw your phone at me,

408
00:33:29.758 --> 00:33:31.552 line:80%
my stomach started to hurt.

409
00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:34.221 line:80%
I was so scared.

410
00:33:34.304 --> 00:33:36.890 line:80%
And I didn't know what to do.

411
00:33:36.974 --> 00:33:40.519 line:80%
I didn't want to disappoint your mom,
so I couldn't tell you.

412
00:34:04.418 --> 00:34:05.878 line:80%
Our baby.

413
00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:24.062 line:80%
By the way...

414
00:34:26.482 --> 00:34:30.360 line:80%
You said you craved beef
during our honeymoon because of the baby.

415
00:34:32.279 --> 00:34:35.991 line:80%
But didn't you not have the baby then?

416
00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:43.290 line:80%
Didn't you say you had a house
when you didn't too?

417
00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:45.292 line:80%
What?

418
00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:47.753 line:80%
But our baby...

419
00:35:23.163 --> 00:35:24.206 line:80%
Ms. Kang!

420
00:35:25.082 --> 00:35:26.708 line:80%
You scared me.

421
00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:28.293 line:80%
Didn't you leave earlier?

422
00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:31.380 line:80%
I thought of you.

423
00:35:40.597 --> 00:35:43.851 line:80%
Since last Christmas,
I've been trying to eat healthy.

424
00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:48.814 line:80%
This is rich in protein and so crunchy!
It's my favorite lately.

425
00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:50.732 line:80%
Really?

426
00:35:54.778 --> 00:35:56.321 line:80%
It is good.

427
00:35:57.531 --> 00:35:58.949 line:80%
But for some reason...

428
00:35:59.992 --> 00:36:01.910 line:80%
Does it remind you of something?

429
00:36:02.452 --> 00:36:04.913 line:80%
It's probably this!

430
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:08.750 line:80%
It's perfect. I desperately needed it.

431
00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:20.220 line:80%
To tell the truth, my brother bought
all this saying you'd need it.

432
00:36:21.305 --> 00:36:22.180 line:80%
What?

433
00:36:38.655 --> 00:36:42.034 line:80%
He's been hesitant
and walking on eggshells lately.

434
00:36:42.743 --> 00:36:45.329 line:80%
Is it because of Yu-ra?

435
00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.835 line:80%
Yes, well...

436
00:36:54.296 --> 00:36:56.048 line:80%
She's been seeing my grandpa.

437
00:36:57.257 --> 00:36:58.342 line:80%
But Ms. Kang,

438
00:36:58.425 --> 00:37:00.427 line:80%
whether he called off the engagement

439
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:04.056 line:80%
for you or because he came to his senses,
I'm totally in favor.

440
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:08.894 line:80%
To tell you the truth,
he got engaged because of me.

441
00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:13.774 line:80%
He said we should make a family
firm enough to stand on like land.

442
00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:22.491 line:80%
Also, my brother had no interest
in dating.

443
00:37:23.325 --> 00:37:27.412 line:80%
He just seemed emotionless.
He always suppressed his emotions.

444
00:37:27.496 --> 00:37:28.830 line:80%
Like some robot.

445
00:37:30.707 --> 00:37:32.292 line:80%
He's so different lately.

446
00:37:32.376 --> 00:37:33.627 line:80%
He wasn't like this.

447
00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:37.381 line:80%
The weather is chilly.

448
00:37:37.464 --> 00:37:39.758 line:80%
-Go inside.
-I'm okay.

449
00:37:40.384 --> 00:37:42.010 line:80%
-Hey.
-I'm back.

450
00:37:42.928 --> 00:37:44.680 line:80%
I'll escort Yu-ra now.

451
00:37:44.763 --> 00:37:46.098 line:80%
Yeah, okay. Bye.

452
00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:48.308 line:80%
-I'll come again.
-Okay, come often.

453
00:37:48.392 --> 00:37:49.476 line:80%
-Okay.
-Bye.

454
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:55.816 line:80%
What are you doing?

455
00:37:56.483 --> 00:38:00.362 line:80%
I've been meaning to tell you this.
You've changed a lot.

456
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.533 line:80%
You didn't just change your appearance.

457
00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:06.868 line:80%
You're a man now.

458
00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:10.580 line:80%
I came to see your grandfather.

459
00:38:11.415 --> 00:38:15.752 line:80%
No matter how our relationship is,
he and I are still close.

460
00:38:16.253 --> 00:38:18.338 line:80%
That's interesting.

461
00:38:18.422 --> 00:38:20.632 line:80%
I think you two suddenly got closer.

462
00:38:21.258 --> 00:38:24.803 line:80%
You came to Korea on the 8th
and visited him three times.

463
00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:32.185 line:80%
It never happened
in our five-year engagement.

464
00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.188 line:80%
Things like this.

465
00:38:35.272 --> 00:38:38.358 line:80%
You didn't care about anything but work.

466
00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:40.485 line:80%
You're so detailed now.

467
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.572 line:80%
Is it because of her?

468
00:38:44.406 --> 00:38:46.199 line:80%
Didn't you accept my decision?

469
00:38:47.993 --> 00:38:50.412 line:80%
That was before I knew there was a woman.

470
00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:55.250 line:80%
I don't like anyone touching

471
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:57.252 line:80%
what's mine.

472
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.422 line:80%
Also, Yu-ra may seem normal,

473
00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:03.675 line:80%
but she's a total whack job.

474
00:39:03.759 --> 00:39:04.676 line:80%
2017

475
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.514 line:80%
Get out.

476
00:39:18.148 --> 00:39:20.192 line:80%
How much longer will you do this?

477
00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:22.194 line:80%
You know we're not anything.

478
00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:25.655 line:80%
It's her fault. Why covet what's mine?

479
00:39:27.074 --> 00:39:32.412 line:80%
I don't like anyone touching what's mine.

480
00:39:34.581 --> 00:39:35.457 line:80%
Enough.

481
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.001 line:80%
Ms. Kang.

482
00:39:40.504 --> 00:39:42.130 line:80%
I know Mr. Yu's a good person.

483
00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:44.633 line:80%
This is my fault.

484
00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:47.552 line:80%
So let's stop talking about this.

485
00:39:47.636 --> 00:39:48.595 line:80%
Ms. Kang.

486
00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.475 line:80%
I'm not actually his real little sister.

487
00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.690 line:80%
My brother was hurt badly
because of me and my mom.

488
00:40:00.774 --> 00:40:02.984 line:80%
So...

489
00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:08.198 line:80%
He could never cheat on anyone.

490
00:40:21.378 --> 00:40:22.587 line:80%
I realized it again.

491
00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:25.507 line:80%
Yu-ra's a great kid.

492
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.846 line:80%
You don't think she visits you
with good intentions, do you?

493
00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:33.223 line:80%
That's why I like her.

494
00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:36.726 line:80%
She's greedy enough
to be lady of the U&K household.

495
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.729 line:80%
I like those who obsess
over what's theirs.

496
00:40:39.813 --> 00:40:42.023 line:80%
A man should meet the right woman.

497
00:40:42.107 --> 00:40:45.443 line:80%
A woman needs spite to protect her family.

498
00:40:48.572 --> 00:40:51.283 line:80%
You're right. You said that.

499
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:54.661 line:80%
That's why I thought it'd be okay.

500
00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:01.042 line:80%
Grandfather.

501
00:41:02.169 --> 00:41:03.920 line:80%
When my mother was alive,

502
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.799 line:80%
how did you feel
about Father meeting Ms. Cha?

503
00:41:11.303 --> 00:41:14.598 line:80%
Did Ms. Cha have more spite and greed

504
00:41:15.849 --> 00:41:17.350 line:80%
than my mother?

505
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:25.150 line:80%
I liked Ms. Cha.

506
00:41:27.903 --> 00:41:31.448 line:80%
Mother was always sick,
and I relied more on her as a kid.

507
00:41:37.287 --> 00:41:42.417 line:80%
Before I learned that Hui-yeon was
only five years younger than me.

508
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:53.178 line:80%
After learning that,
I felt bad for Hui-yeon.

509
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:02.604 line:80%
So after I got engaged to Yu-ra,

510
00:42:02.687 --> 00:42:05.815 line:80%
I held it in
even when I couldn't stand it.

511
00:42:08.485 --> 00:42:12.113 line:80%
I vowed that I'd never become
like my father.

512
00:42:16.284 --> 00:42:19.704 line:80%
But I only learned
things didn't work that way

513
00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:23.750 line:80%
when I saw the end.

514
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:28.380 line:80%
But...

515
00:42:38.974 --> 00:42:41.518 line:80%
What should I have done, Grandfather?

516
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.650 line:80%
It's too hard.

517
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:02.539 line:80%
So he's the bastard that cheated on
his girlfriend with her bestie.

518
00:43:02.622 --> 00:43:06.334 line:80%
And she's the bitch that married
her bestie's boyfriend.

519
00:43:06.418 --> 00:43:08.670 line:80%
Because they don't know who Ji-hyuk is?

520
00:43:09.754 --> 00:43:11.047 line:80%
Yes.

521
00:43:11.131 --> 00:43:12.674 line:80%
Those fools.

522
00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:14.676 line:80%
What if they find out?

523
00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:43.455 line:80%
There's laundry to do today.
Don't just do what's in the basket.

524
00:43:43.538 --> 00:43:46.833 line:80%
Organize the closet
and wash the old clothes too.

525
00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:50.211 line:80%
By myself? Where are you going?

526
00:43:50.295 --> 00:43:54.299 line:80%
I'm the secretary of the Women's Center.
I have a luncheon.

527
00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:56.634 line:80%
Oh, right.

528
00:43:59.763 --> 00:44:04.100 line:80%
Since you're alone, take it easy
while listening to it.

529
00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:07.354 line:80%
Isn't your life so sweet?

530
00:44:07.437 --> 00:44:08.813 line:80%
You're so lucky.

531
00:44:09.731 --> 00:44:15.820 line:80%
Your grandmother will be back later,
our little general.

532
00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:39.803 line:80%
Darn it...

533
00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:41.346 line:80%
Seriously?

534
00:44:43.765 --> 00:44:45.642 line:80%
Is this really right?

535
00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:47.519 line:80%
Is this married life?

536
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:11.584 line:80%
What's this?

537
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.255 line:80%
U&K STOCKHOLDER'S LIST

538
00:45:15.964 --> 00:45:16.965 line:80%
Yu Ji-hyuk...

539
00:45:18.133 --> 00:45:22.971 line:80%
YU JI-HYUK
YU HUI-YEON

540
00:45:25.432 --> 00:45:26.683 line:80%
What is this?

541
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.103 line:80%
No way.

542
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.147 line:80%
Did she really...

543
00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:33.815 line:80%
Su-min.

544
00:45:34.816 --> 00:45:38.486 line:80%
I have some trash to throw away.
Will you do it for me?

545
00:45:40.113 --> 00:45:41.448 line:80%
Congratulations

546
00:45:41.531 --> 00:45:45.326 line:80%
on picking up my trash.

547
00:45:49.998 --> 00:45:51.833 line:80%
She dumps Min-hwan on me

548
00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:55.253 line:80%
and goes for a rich man?

549
00:45:59.883 --> 00:46:02.218 line:80%
No way. No.

550
00:46:03.803 --> 00:46:04.804 line:80%
I stole him.

551
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.807 line:80%
I did it.

552
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:09.851 line:80%
I did!

553
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:12.896 line:80%
No!

554
00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:34.834 line:80%
Why is...

555
00:46:36.002 --> 00:46:37.212 line:80%
the house like this?

556
00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:38.755 line:80%
Why are you asking me?

557
00:46:38.838 --> 00:46:43.134 line:80%
Your wife did this to the house,
locked the door, and won't come out.

558
00:47:03.363 --> 00:47:04.489 line:80%
What?

559
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:11.371 line:80%
What?

560
00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:16.376 line:80%
Damn it...

561
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.964 line:80%
All that tall jerk did
was be born into the right family.

562
00:47:22.382 --> 00:47:25.718 line:80%
What the hell have my parents done
their entire lives?

563
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:32.433 line:80%
I can fly much higher
with a little support.

564
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.105 line:80%
Are you jealous of Yu Ji-hyuk right now?

565
00:47:38.731 --> 00:47:42.402 line:80%
Kang Ji-won dumped you on me.

566
00:47:43.278 --> 00:47:45.238 line:80%
So what will you do about it now?

567
00:47:52.287 --> 00:47:54.497 line:80%
So it wasn't just trash.

568
00:47:55.248 --> 00:47:57.584 line:80%
I picked up trash with no pride.

569
00:47:58.334 --> 00:47:59.502 line:80%
You little...

570
00:47:59.586 --> 00:48:01.629 line:80%
Not just that. You're stupid too.

571
00:48:02.255 --> 00:48:03.548 line:80%
Have you paid off your debt?

572
00:48:03.631 --> 00:48:06.426 line:80%
My mom can hear you. Stop bring that up.

573
00:48:10.096 --> 00:48:13.057 line:80%
How much is left?
Is 100 million won enough?

574
00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:15.643 line:80%
What?

575
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:18.396 line:80%
We deserve compensation.

576
00:48:19.355 --> 00:48:21.691 line:80%
Why does Ji-won get all the good stuff?

577
00:48:24.152 --> 00:48:25.945 line:80%
Are you out of your mind?

578
00:48:26.863 --> 00:48:29.991 line:80%
Do you think she'll give it to you?

579
00:48:30.742 --> 00:48:32.118 line:80%
I'll make her.

580
00:48:33.786 --> 00:48:35.955 line:80%
I know everything about her.

581
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.916 line:80%
Even what she doesn't know.

582
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:21.376 line:80%
Happy you beat me?

583
00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:25.171 line:80%
You're my other half.
We can't just end things like this.

584
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.450 line:80%
Ji-won, I can't reach you.

585
00:49:54.534 --> 00:49:56.869 line:80%
How have you been?

586
00:49:56.953 --> 00:49:59.497 line:80%
I heard about you by chance.

587
00:50:01.416 --> 00:50:02.583 line:80%
It's your mom.

588
00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:23.730 line:80%
Ji-won.

589
00:50:32.697 --> 00:50:34.115 line:80%
You grew up so well.

590
00:50:37.118 --> 00:50:38.703 line:80%
You really did.

591
00:50:41.956 --> 00:50:43.750 line:80%
You're still beautiful.

592
00:50:46.169 --> 00:50:49.088 line:80%
You were always
the prettiest in our neighborhood.

593
00:50:51.299 --> 00:50:52.884 line:80%
I'm all old now.

594
00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:56.471 line:80%
Time can't help but pass.

595
00:50:59.807 --> 00:51:01.100 line:80%
You're pretty too.

596
00:51:01.893 --> 00:51:03.519 line:80%
I'm glad you take after me.

597
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:09.150 line:80%
I know it's in the past now,

598
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:16.073 line:80%
but I never liked your father much.

599
00:51:17.325 --> 00:51:18.951 line:80%
I was young and struggling,

600
00:51:19.452 --> 00:51:21.454 line:80%
and he liked me so much.

601
00:51:22.622 --> 00:51:24.457 line:80%
I thought I could like him too.

602
00:51:25.792 --> 00:51:28.252 line:80%
Everyone got married like that back then.

603
00:51:28.836 --> 00:51:30.505 line:80%
So I didn't like you either.

604
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:34.008 line:80%
I mean, I did.

605
00:51:34.717 --> 00:51:36.886 line:80%
You're my kid. How could I not?

606
00:51:39.555 --> 00:51:42.350 line:80%
Anyway, I'm sorry.

607
00:51:44.185 --> 00:51:45.770 line:80%
I was immature.

608
00:51:47.688 --> 00:51:49.816 line:80%
I had you when I wasn't ready.

609
00:51:52.193 --> 00:51:53.194 line:80%
Still...

610
00:51:55.238 --> 00:51:57.156 line:80%
I missed you so much.

611
00:51:59.534 --> 00:52:01.619 line:80%
Then why didn't you come to see me?

612
00:52:04.372 --> 00:52:08.501 line:80%
Forget my dad,
you could've come to see me.

613
00:52:08.584 --> 00:52:10.336 line:80%
I did.

614
00:52:11.462 --> 00:52:12.797 line:80%
He didn't let me.

615
00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:16.717 line:80%
Do you not know
how much he cared about you?

616
00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:20.972 line:80%
I know he was a good father to you.

617
00:52:22.181 --> 00:52:23.307 line:80%
He was sweet.

618
00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.727 line:80%
But he was so stubborn.

619
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:28.688 line:80%
He wasn't considerate.

620
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:32.984 line:80%
It was hard for me too.

621
00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:37.530 line:80%
I was only able to come to see you
after I heard your father had passed.

622
00:52:38.239 --> 00:52:39.490 line:80%
It took me courage.

623
00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:45.121 line:80%
My father tried his best to raise me.

624
00:52:48.583 --> 00:52:51.752 line:80%
Of course, your absence was big for me.

625
00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:54.714 line:80%
I was just an adolescent girl.

626
00:52:59.802 --> 00:53:02.680 line:80%
That's why I became attached
to the wrong people.

627
00:53:04.307 --> 00:53:06.434 line:80%
I didn't know how to express myself.

628
00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:07.935 line:80%
No...

629
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:12.273 line:80%
Actually, I didn't know how I felt.

630
00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:16.611 line:80%
There was no one to teach me.

631
00:53:20.281 --> 00:53:21.449 line:80%
I'm sorry.

632
00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:26.037 line:80%
It's all my fault.

633
00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:30.917 line:80%
I was a bad mother,
and it made you suffer.

634
00:53:31.667 --> 00:53:33.294 line:80%
How can I make it up to you?

635
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:37.214 line:80%
How can I do it?

636
00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:51.354 line:80%
What are you doing tomorrow?

637
00:53:51.437 --> 00:53:52.563 line:80%
What?

638
00:53:54.649 --> 00:53:57.944 line:80%
If you're free,
would you like to spend time with me?

639
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.339 line:80%
Did you get home okay yesterday?

640
00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:19.715 line:80%
Did you sleep well?

641
00:54:21.133 --> 00:54:22.635 line:80%
Yes, what about you, Mom?

642
00:54:23.511 --> 00:54:25.179 line:80%
Is it because I met you?

643
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:26.931 line:80%
I couldn't sleep at all.

644
00:54:30.685 --> 00:54:32.478 line:80%
Are you craving anything?

645
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:35.982 line:80%
Pork
gukbap
.

646
00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:41.404 line:80%
Do you know how to do this?

647
00:54:41.487 --> 00:54:42.989 line:80%
This is my first time.

648
00:54:43.072 --> 00:54:44.073 line:80%
This is pretty.

649
00:54:44.156 --> 00:54:45.449 line:80%
Where do we look?

650
00:54:45.533 --> 00:54:46.701 line:80%
Here?

651
00:54:46.784 --> 00:54:48.744 line:80%
I LOVE YOU

652
00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:53.207 line:80%
WITH MOM

653
00:54:53.916 --> 00:54:54.959 line:80%
Heart?

654
00:54:55.042 --> 00:54:57.003 line:80%
One, two, three.

655
00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:03.509 line:80%
This is so pretty.

656
00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:06.804 line:80%
They don't sell this in Busan.
Does it look good on me?

657
00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:09.181 line:80%
We'll take this.

658
00:55:09.265 --> 00:55:11.058 line:80%
No, don't!

659
00:55:11.142 --> 00:55:13.019 line:80%
That's okay.

660
00:55:13.102 --> 00:55:14.437 line:80%
This is so expensive.

661
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.188 line:80%
Show us this.

662
00:55:16.272 --> 00:55:18.482 line:80%
It's too expensive.

663
00:55:19.066 --> 00:55:21.736 line:80%
Still, shall I just try it on?

664
00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:23.612 line:80%
-Can we?
-Yes.

665
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:27.074 line:80%
How does it look?

666
00:55:27.158 --> 00:55:28.451 line:80%
-It looks good.
-Does it?

667
00:55:32.246 --> 00:55:34.790 line:80%
I wanted to buy something like this.

668
00:55:34.874 --> 00:55:37.752 line:80%
My friends brag
about their daughters so much.

669
00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:38.836 line:80%
How does it look?

670
00:55:39.587 --> 00:55:41.047 line:80%
It looks good on you.

671
00:55:41.756 --> 00:55:43.215 line:80%
What about the black?

672
00:55:43.924 --> 00:55:44.925 line:80%
The size is...

673
00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:51.182 line:80%
Are you that happy?

674
00:55:51.265 --> 00:55:53.392 line:80%
Of course.

675
00:55:53.476 --> 00:55:56.020 line:80%
I'm so lucky to have a daughter like you.

676
00:55:57.313 --> 00:56:00.608 line:80%
Since you date a rich man,
you know how to spend...

677
00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:13.037 line:80%
I knew it.

678
00:56:17.124 --> 00:56:22.088 line:80%
Even when I went to a good college and
joined a big company, you never called.

679
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:26.133 line:80%
Ji-won, what I just said--

680
00:56:26.217 --> 00:56:28.344 line:80%
If you're talking about Yu Ji-hyuk,

681
00:56:28.427 --> 00:56:31.013 line:80%
I'm not seeing him. We broke up.

682
00:56:32.348 --> 00:56:33.349 line:80%
What?

683
00:56:34.517 --> 00:56:35.726 line:80%
Why on earth?

684
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.149 line:80%
Are you lying to me right now?

685
00:56:44.652 --> 00:56:45.861 line:80%
Why did you do it?

686
00:56:49.824 --> 00:56:51.158 line:80%
Why?

687
00:56:52.952 --> 00:56:55.162 line:80%
Then why did you run away?

688
00:57:00.626 --> 00:57:02.336 line:80%
I didn't want to believe it.

689
00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:05.714 line:80%
Goodness. Look who called.

690
00:57:05.798 --> 00:57:07.216 line:80%
How have you been?

691
00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:09.844 line:80%
-It's been so long--
-
I heard you needed money.

692
00:57:14.807 --> 00:57:16.225 line:80%
Did you know everything?

693
00:57:19.854 --> 00:57:21.147 line:80%
Then what is this?

694
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.233 line:80%
I wanted to try it once.

695
00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.823 line:80%
A date with my mom.

696
00:57:32.867 --> 00:57:35.035 line:80%
A loved daughter, a good daughter.

697
00:57:35.995 --> 00:57:37.538 line:80%
Happy mother and daughter.

698
00:57:42.334 --> 00:57:44.253 line:80%
I wanted to try it once.

699
00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:49.592 line:80%
Now I've done it.

700
00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:52.219 line:80%
Have a safe trip back.

701
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:58.684 line:80%
Do you have any money?

702
00:57:59.894 --> 00:58:01.896 line:80%
A good college and a good company.

703
00:58:01.979 --> 00:58:03.731 line:80%
Do you have 100 million won?

704
00:58:04.773 --> 00:58:06.650 line:80%
I'll never come see you again.

705
00:58:07.318 --> 00:58:09.195 line:80%
Do you think I wanted to?

706
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:14.283 line:80%
You should understand me!
Who else would understand your mom?

707
00:58:20.039 --> 00:58:23.042 line:80%
I have no money. I have no mother either.

708
00:58:24.585 --> 00:58:27.671 line:80%
I didn't before,
and I won't in the future.

709
00:58:28.964 --> 00:58:33.886 line:80%
You chose to live as a woman
instead of a mother,

710
00:58:35.387 --> 00:58:38.933 line:80%
so live the rest of your life
that way quietly.

711
00:58:40.476 --> 00:58:41.769 line:80%
Don't be greedy.

712
00:58:56.367 --> 00:58:57.576 line:80%
You wench.

713
00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:21.642 line:80%
No wonder they live like that.

714
00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:25.896 line:80%
Why do I always have to do it myself
to get things done properly?

715
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:29.149 line:80%
I said I was going to a funeral.

716
00:59:30.317 --> 00:59:32.027 line:80%
No one died!

717
00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:37.116 line:80%
I can't stay at home.
Try a married life. Can you come out now?

718
00:59:37.199 --> 00:59:38.325 line:80%
Damn it...

719
00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:46.458 line:80%
What was that?

720
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:55.926 line:80%
What?

721
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.808 line:80%
Park Min-hwan?

722
01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:07.062 line:80%
Yes?

723
01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.455 line:80%
I flipped him!

724
01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.832 line:80%
For the first time. Finally!

725
01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:15.422 line:80%
Yes, I've still got it!
The reserve for the national...

726
01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:31.772 line:80%
KANG HYEON-MO

727
01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:36.735 line:80%
Dad.

728
01:01:42.408 --> 01:01:43.867 line:80%
The gift you gave me...

729
01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:49.957 line:80%
I wanted to use it really well this time.

730
01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:58.924 line:80%
But why is the world so hard on me?

731
01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.972 line:80%
I hurt someone precious to me again.

732
01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.309 line:80%
It's all too difficult for me.

733
01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:13.981 line:80%
I really wanted to do well this time.

734
01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:16.984 line:80%
What do I do?

735
01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:20.904 line:80%
What do I do in this case?

736
01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:36.628 line:80%
I'm sorry I'm such a fool.

737
01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:35.479 line:80%
Yes.

738
01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:38.690 line:80%
Okay. In three minutes?

739
01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:40.692 line:80%
I understand.

740
01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:18.790 line:80%
Kang Ji-won stole my fiancé.

741
01:05:18.874 --> 01:05:23.754 line:80%
You punish the woman who betrayed you,
and change your life with a fortune.

742
01:05:24.338 --> 01:05:27.799 line:80%
What do I have to do to make that happen?

743
01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:30.093 line:80%
Kill Kang Ji-won.

744
01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:31.595 line:80%
I'll clean up the mess.

745
01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:36.016 line:80%
Do as you're told,
and this shitty life is over.

746
01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:38.060 line:80%
Say it again.

747
01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.853 line:80%
Stop lying.

748
01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.647 line:80%
Why are you doing this to me?

749
01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.316 line:80%
I can't protect you forever.

750
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.401 line:80%
I like you so much.

751
01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.320 line:80%
Don't blame yourself.

752
01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:51.281 line:80%
The inevitable just happened.

753
01:05:57.496 --> 01:05:59.498 line:80%
