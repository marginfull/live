00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.160 line:82%
My beloved,

2
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.720 line:82%
I'm far away from you,
but you're right in front of me.

3
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.040 line:82%
I feel as if I'm watching you.

4
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.800 line:82%
You must be reading this letter
lying down in solitude.

5
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.040 line:82%
Everything around you
must've blended with you.

6
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.840 line:82%
The clouds must've spread all over,
just like the kohl in your eyes.

7
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.240 line:82%
You must be gazing all around you,
having shifted your eyes from the letter.

8
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.840 line:82%
The entire earth
must be resembling your face.

9
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.640 line:82%
Who is it?

10
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.520 line:82%
Sunil was supposed to come
and pick you up.

11
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.120 line:82%
-Why hasn't he come as yet?
-I don't know.

12
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.360 line:82%
Wow! Sunil has a wonderful style
to announce his arrival!

13
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.320 line:82%
Your eyes, they're sheer magic

14
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640 line:82%
Your body's sheer perfume

15
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.120 line:82%
Your eyes, they're sheer magic

16
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.040 line:82%
Your body's sheer perfume

17
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.400 line:82%
Say yes

18
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.280 line:82%
Or no

19
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.080 line:82%
Whether you say yes or no
You are mine, Kiran

20
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.040 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

21
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.640 line:82%
The distance between us is vanishing

22
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.160 line:82%
We're getting closer to each other

23
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.280 line:82%
The distance between us is vanishing

24
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.600 line:82%
We're getting closer to each other

25
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.880 line:82%
From the skies, I will seek you

26
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.640 line:82%
From this world, I shall snatch you away

27
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.240 line:82%
Say yes

28
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.920 line:82%
Or say no

29
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.520 line:82%
Whether you say yes or no
You are mine, Kiran

30
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.360 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

31
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.920 line:82%
Your eyes are sheer magic

32
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.680 line:82%
Yours is an enchanting scent

33
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.240 line:82%
Say yes

34
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.240 line:82%
Or say no

35
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.080 line:82%
Whether you agree or disagree
You are mine, Kiran

36
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.840 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

37
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

38
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.320 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

39
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.360 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

40
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.040 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

41
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.360 line:82%
-What are you thinking, Kiran?
-I know Sunil is somewhere around.

42
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.760 line:82%
-But he isn't revealing himself.
-Why could he be hiding himself?

43
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.240 line:82%
He enjoys harassing me a lot.

44
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.360 line:82%
I know where Sunil is.

45
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.640 line:82%
You know? Then tell me.

46
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.160 line:82%
Come on.

47
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.800 line:82%
Over here.
His image is hidden here in the heart.

48
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.920 line:82%
Bye bye. See you.

49
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.480 line:82%
When love crosses limits,
it becomes devotion.

50
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.480 line:82%
And when devotion goes astray,
it becomes an obsession.

51
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.920 line:82%
This story too
is about the obsession of love.

52
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.680 line:82%
It has the truth which was present
in the love of Laila and Majnu.

53
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.880 line:82%
It also has the intensity,

54
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.320 line:82%
that was there in the hearts
of Romeo and Juliet.

55
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.280 line:82%
It also has emotions like in the songs
of Heer and Ranjha.

56
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.440 line:82%
But it also has one more element...

57
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.720 line:82%
something which has not featured
in any love story so far.

58
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.560 line:82%
Fear.

59
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.600 line:82%
You are the picture of my dreams

60
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.080 line:82%
You are my destiny itself, O ignorant one

61
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.240 line:82%
You are the picture of my dreams

62
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.640 line:82%
You are my destiny itself, O ignorant one

63
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.920 line:82%
Don't ever belong to someone else

64
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.080 line:82%
Or I could go to any lengths
That's how crazy I am

65
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.480 line:82%
Agree

66
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.000 line:82%
Or disagree

67
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.920 line:82%
Whether you agree or disagree
You are mine, Kiran

68
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.040 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

69
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.680 line:82%
Your eyes cast a spell

70
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.400 line:82%
Yours is an enchanting scent

71
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.760 line:82%
Acquiesce

72
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.800 line:82%
Or decline

73
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.320 line:82%
Whether you acquiesce or decline
You are mine, Kiran

74
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.560 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

75
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.760 line:82%
Terrorists have kidnapped
the little daughter of our Minister.

76
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.000 line:82%
And they've put forth the condition that
if their leader is not released...

77
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.840 line:82%
they'll kill the child.

78
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.800 line:82%
We've to save the girl.
And only you can carry out this task.

79
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.360 line:82%
Where is the child, Sir?

80
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.280 line:82%
Their boat is anchored
in the middle of the ocean.

81
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.640 line:82%
The child is there.

82
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.880 line:82%
Sunil, we are all proud of the task
executed by you and your unit.

83
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.080 line:82%
As long as we have brave men like you,

84
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.440 line:82%
the enemies of peace
can never succeed in our country.

85
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.400 line:82%
I thank you all
on behalf of the government,

86
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.600 line:82%
the minister and myself.

87
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.200 line:82%
In view of the success of the mission,

88
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.760 line:82%
all of you are being granted a holiday
for a period of one month.

89
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.360 line:82%
We will meet again after a month.

90
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.560 line:82%
Jai Hind.

91
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.200 line:82%
This is the final day of this match.

92
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.200 line:82%
India needs just 2 wickets to win.
The pressure is mounting on England.

93
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.360 line:82%
Azhar's team is under pressure.
And he has tightened the fielding.

94
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.680 line:82%
-Let's go. We're getting late.
-India's bowlers

95
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.720 line:82%
are bowling cautiously because
this win is very crucial to them.

96
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.440 line:82%
We should win. Come on.

97
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.360 line:82%
We're getting late.
Kiran's train must've arrived already.

98
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.440 line:82%
To hell with the train. I will return
only after ensuring India's win.

99
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.520 line:82%
There comes Kumble! Come on.

100
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.200 line:82%
You are least worried.
Shall I go on my own?

101
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.880 line:82%
Vijay, just look at the time.

102
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.160 line:82%
All right. I am leaving.

103
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.080 line:82%
We have seen enough.

104
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.040 line:82%
There is a delay but no denial.

105
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.120 line:82%
Out!

106
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.840 line:82%
My countrymen have been wonderful.

107
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.640 line:82%
Win!

108
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.160 line:82%
Let's go now, at least!

109
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.400 line:82%
Kapil Dev was so insistent
that I have a cup of tea with him.

110
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.040 line:82%
But you're always in a hurry.

111
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.480 line:82%
Come on, get down now.

112
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.080 line:82%
Mr. Sunil had telephoned for you.

113
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.800 line:82%
Don't take his name in my presence.

114
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.320 line:82%
-Why is she so enraged?
-She isn't.

115
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.920 line:82%
The fire of love is flaring
since Sunil didn't come to receive her.

116
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.680 line:82%
Not everyone is a hen-pecked husband,
like I am.

117
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.720 line:82%
Yes, yes. I know.

118
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.920 line:82%
No! He doesn't love me.

119
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.760 line:82%
He didn't even...

120
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.360 line:82%
He didn't even come to the station.

121
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.640 line:82%
I won't spare him when I meet him.

122
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.560 line:82%
Sunil, you!

123
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.520 line:82%
You shameless fellow.
You are always scaring me.

124
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.480 line:82%
I felt as if a corpse fell on me.

125
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.480 line:82%
You're mad.

126
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.040 line:82%
Don't you know that in a girl's cupboard,

127
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.080 line:82%
one gets nothing except old letters,
old lovers or new sarees.

128
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.000 line:82%
You hopeless romantic.
What if my heart had failed?

129
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.680 line:82%
How could it have failed?
It's in my possession.

130
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.880 line:82%
I won't speak to you. You're a bad man.

131
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.080 line:82%
Just look how my heart is beating.

132
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.600 line:82%
-Yes, it indeed is beating.
-Don't fool around now. Tell me,

133
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.720 line:82%
why didn't you meet me
when you came to Shimla?

134
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.720 line:82%
Why did you have to harass me so much?

135
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.080 line:82%
It would've been so much fun
if we had returned together.

136
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.000 line:82%
Which fool said that I'd come to Simla?

137
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.120 line:82%
-You didn't?
-No!

138
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.640 line:82%
-Really?
-Darling,

139
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.280 line:82%
someone who dreams
of always being by your side,

140
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.240 line:82%
how can he not appear before you
if he is close to you?

141
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.560 line:82%
Then who was that person?

142
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.200 line:82%
She's not.

143
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.160 line:82%
She's mine.

144
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.480 line:82%
She's not.

145
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.680 line:82%
She's mine.

146
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.080 line:82%
She's not.

147
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.520 line:82%
She's mine.

148
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.160 line:82%
She's not.

149
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.200 line:82%
She's mine.

150
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.080 line:82%
She's not.

151
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.440 line:82%
She's mine.

152
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.000 line:82%
She's not.

153
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.200 line:82%
She's mine.

154
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.000 line:82%
Kiran! You are mine!

155
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.800 line:82%
It's a nice place.

156
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.520 line:82%
Whose house are we going to?

157
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.600 line:82%
A house belongs to those who live in it.

158
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.760 line:82%
That's what I want to know.
Who lives here?

159
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.920 line:82%
Right now, it's some hopes and some dreams
that live there.

160
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.520 line:82%
-Come on. Tell me.
-I will tell you. Come on.

161
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.720 line:82%
Why're you harassing me?
Why don't you tell me who is living here?

162
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.880 line:82%
As you wish!

163
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.240 line:82%
What is this?

164
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.200 line:82%
This is our home.

165
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.240 line:82%
After our marriage,
this small world will be ours.

166
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.560 line:82%
It's a small house, but

167
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.040 line:82%
it's a small house, but

168
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.840 line:82%
I hope you will like it

169
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.680 line:82%
Shut the doors first

170
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.240 line:82%
Shut the doors first

171
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.440 line:82%
Whether I say yes or no

172
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.000 line:82%
Whether I say yes or no

173
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.120 line:82%
You must bring me around

174
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.240 line:82%
Shut the door first

175
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.560 line:82%
Shut the door first

176
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.720 line:82%
This isn't just a house, it's a dream

177
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.720 line:82%
Not a dream, our love is for real

178
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.320 line:82%
This isn't just a house, it's a dream

179
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.040 line:82%
Not a dream, our love is for real

180
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.160 line:82%
So let's give each other a loving hug

181
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.200 line:82%
So let's give each other a loving hug

182
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.400 line:82%
And make the best of our meeting

183
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.560 line:82%
After you have shut the door

184
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.520 line:82%
Whether I say yes or no

185
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.840 line:82%
Whether I say yes or no

186
00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.280 line:82%
You must bring me around

187
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.880 line:82%
Shut the door first

188
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.280 line:82%
Shut the door first

189
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.480 line:82%
Do not touch me, lover boy

190
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.320 line:82%
It'll soil my fair body

191
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.440 line:82%
Do not touch me, lover boy

192
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.840 line:82%
It'll soil my fair body

193
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.360 line:82%
Of this color and beauty

194
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.400 line:82%
Don't let your complexion and your beauty

195
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.800 line:82%
Make you so vain

196
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.440 line:82%
Let's shut the door first

197
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.800 line:82%
Whether I say yes or not

198
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.200 line:82%
Whether I say yes or not

199
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.240 line:82%
You must bring me around

200
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.200 line:82%
Shut the door first

201
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.640 line:82%
So let's shut the door

202
00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.520 line:82%
Must I bring the Sun and the stars?
Or must I bring flowers?

203
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.240 line:82%
How am I to decorate this house?

204
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.120 line:82%
With flowers, I'll do up the house

205
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.440 line:82%
Tell me what things have I to bring then?

206
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.920 line:82%
It's your heart, I'm going to live in

207
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.040 line:82%
It's your heart, I'm going to live in

208
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.200 line:82%
Just you make arrangements for that

209
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.520 line:82%
Let's shut the door first

210
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.520 line:82%
It's a small house, but

211
00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.520 line:82%
It's a small house, but

212
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.680 line:82%
I hope you will like it

213
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.680 line:82%
Shut the doors first

214
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.560 line:82%
Whether I say yes or no

215
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.800 line:82%
Whether I say yes or no

216
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.360 line:82%
You must bring me around

217
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.000 line:82%
After you have shut the door

218
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.240 line:82%
After you have shut the door

219
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.360 line:82%
After you have shut the door

220
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.840 line:82%
After you have shut the door

221
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.920 line:82%
Good night love.

222
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.720 line:82%
What's the hurry?

223
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.760 line:82%
Mr. Sunil Malhotra.

224
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.480 line:82%
The mischief in your eyes
and the smile on your lips,

225
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.360 line:82%
indicate that
you don't have honorable intentions.

226
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.840 line:82%
Intentions are good, but I've evil plans.

227
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.000 line:82%
Hey! Brother.

228
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.120 line:82%
Where's the key?

229
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.720 line:82%
Who is it?

230
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.840 line:82%
What's this nonsense?

231
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.080 line:82%
Who is it?

232
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.720 line:82%
Open the door.

233
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.320 line:82%
Open the door, Brother!

234
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.440 line:82%
Brother! Brother!

235
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.920 line:82%
Sister-in-law!

236
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.320 line:82%
Hurry up!

237
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.040 line:82%
Hey! Where is he?

238
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.560 line:82%
Who is it? It's you, Kiran?

239
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.600 line:82%
-That man...
-What happened? Which man?

240
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.360 line:82%
The one who had sung a song,
was here just now.

241
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.320 line:82%
He was pointing the torch at me.

242
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.240 line:82%
Do you want to play night cricket?
What a strange player you are.

243
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.880 line:82%
You want to play and yet
aren't coming out into the open.

244
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.000 line:82%
Are you bowling in the dark?
Come out into the open.

245
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.680 line:82%
-He ran away.
-Oh God, I got scared.

246
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.480 line:82%
He ran away when he saw my team.

247
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.320 line:82%
If you return again, I will run you out.

248
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.920 line:82%
There's nobody.
You're been imagining things.

249
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.400 line:82%
-I'm feeling scared.
-Why are you scared?

250
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.720 line:82%
We are there with you.

251
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.600 line:82%
And who could it be harassing Kiran?

252
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.600 line:82%
It must be a 12th player.
He wants to play in Sunil's place.

253
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.120 line:82%
But as long as I am the captain,
nobody can play.

254
00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.320 line:82%
-Come on. Let's go to sleep.
-Yes, let's go.

255
00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.760 line:82%
Everything will be fine.

256
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.000 line:82%
Hey! Open the door!
Don't throw me out of the team!

257
00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.920 line:82%
Open the door!

258
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.120 line:82%
Open the door!

259
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.200 line:82%
Who are you?

260
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.000 line:82%
Who are you?

261
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.440 line:82%
Girl's pictures?
But I'm married, aren't I?

262
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.280 line:82%
You're at it in the mornings too?

263
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.520 line:82%
Put on your spectacles.
They are Kiran's pictures.

264
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.120 line:82%
-Where did they come from?
-In the morning post.

265
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.520 line:82%
Kiran.
Some of your photographs have arrived.

266
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.840 line:82%
My photographs?

267
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.840 line:82%
-Who has clicked them?
-What do you mean?

268
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.000 line:82%
Let us know if there is anybody else
besides Sunil.

269
00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.200 line:82%
I don't want to be caught out
on the wrong ball.

270
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.880 line:82%
These photographs are from Shimla.
But I never got them clicked.

271
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.880 line:82%
Then somebody else must've clicked them
to show it to his mother.

272
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.080 line:82%
She's beautiful, Mother.
She's really beautiful.

273
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.760 line:82%
She's so beautiful
that one is scared to even...

274
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.040 line:82%
look at her to one's heart's content.

275
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.400 line:82%
Really, Mother. You will be surprised
to see how beautiful she is.

276
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.920 line:82%
There's a strange magic in her eyes.

277
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.120 line:82%
When she looks, it feels like...

278
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.480 line:82%
time will standstill...

279
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.480 line:82%
the earth will stop rotating...

280
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.680 line:82%
and her smile...

281
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.560 line:82%
Mother, you should see her smiling
at least once.

282
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.280 line:82%
You will feel like all the miseries
in the world have suddenly ended.

283
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.000 line:82%
Like, the whole of earth
is filled with flowers.

284
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.480 line:82%
Mother! Mother! She's not a mere girl,
but a blessing from you.

285
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.400 line:82%
A blessing which has landed on earth.

286
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.560 line:82%
Mother, you should only pray
that I can make her your daughter-in-law.

287
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.160 line:82%
You will pray for your son, won't you?
For his son's happiness?

288
00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.680 line:82%
Rahul?

289
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.240 line:82%
Who are you speaking to, son?

290
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.520 line:82%
I'm talking to Mother.

291
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:24.680 line:82%
What's the problem
if he speaks to his mother sometimes?

292
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.880 line:82%
The problem is that it's been 18 years
since his mother died.

293
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.800 line:82%
-How did she die?
-In a car accident.

294
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.120 line:82%
-Who was driving the car?
-I was.

295
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.320 line:82%
-And you were saved?
-Yes. With the Lord's grace.

296
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.120 line:82%
-How is your relationship with Rahul?
-What do you mean?

297
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.040 line:82%
-Does he consider you a criminal?
-What do you mean?

298
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.120 line:82%
Does he feel
that you are his mother's killer?

299
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.880 line:82%
None of his statements
seem to indicate that.

300
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.400 line:82%
-Does he speak to you?
-On very few occasions.

301
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.720 line:82%
Actually, he has been a lonely
and shy kid since childhood.

302
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.440 line:82%
He has very few friends.
He is lost in his own world.

303
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.520 line:82%
It seems like he has other problems too.

304
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.920 line:82%
Your eyes are sheer magic

305
00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.080 line:82%
Yours is an enchanting scent

306
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.440 line:82%
Your eyes are sheer magic

307
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.680 line:82%
Yours is an enchanting scent

308
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.000 line:82%
Say yes

309
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.640 line:82%
Or no

310
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.280 line:82%
Whether you agree or disagree,
You are mine, Kiran

311
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.520 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

312
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:46.760 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

313
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.160 line:82%
You're the picture of my dreams

314
00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.400 line:82%
You are my destiny itself

315
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.720 line:82%
You are the picture of my dreams

316
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.200 line:82%
You're my destiny itself

317
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.800 line:82%
So you've finally come.

318
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.720 line:82%
-I was held up in the traffic.
-I see...

319
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.040 line:82%
-Shall we go?
-Where to?

320
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.600 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Not there. Here.

321
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.880 line:82%
-Sunil.
-Kiran.

322
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.920 line:82%
-Stop meeting Sunil.
-Who are you?

323
00:33:54.120 --> 00:34:00.080 line:82%
Only a lover can have
such a forceful voice and heavy breath.

324
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.280 line:82%
-Why do you telephone me?
-Don't disconnect the line.

325
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.000 line:82%
Listen to me. It's very urgent.

326
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.600 line:82%
Sunil doesn't deserve you.

327
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.680 line:82%
He wants to win you over
by gifting you a flat.

328
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.840 line:82%
The fool doesn't even understand
that you won't be happy

329
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.200 line:82%
in a concrete flat.

330
00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.440 line:82%
You should stay in a house

331
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.000 line:82%
where the dream-like doors
are decorated with cloud-like curtains.

332
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.560 line:82%
Where there's coolness of wet grass
under one's feet.

333
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.480 line:82%
Where there would be no walls,
but layers of brightness and darkness.

334
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.120 line:82%
Where creeper-plants
have stars growing on them.

335
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.400 line:82%
Where the waves sound like small bells
on an anklet.

336
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.920 line:82%
Why are you stalking me? What do you want?

337
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.680 line:82%
I love you. I love you a lot.

338
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.040 line:82%
Whoever you are,
it's better that you understand,

339
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.680 line:82%
nothing will change by you calling me
or threatening me.

340
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.120 line:82%
I will do whatever I want to do.
I will live the way I wish to.

341
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.520 line:82%
-You can try whatever you want.
-That's what I want, too.

342
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.320 line:82%
That you live life
the way you're suppose to.

343
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.000 line:82%
Close to me, with me, in my arms.

344
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.720 line:82%
Sunil.

345
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.280 line:82%
Sunil!

346
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.240 line:82%
How strange! You didn't answer the phone
though you are at home?

347
00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.400 line:82%
I have been trying to reach you
on the phone for a long time.

348
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.280 line:82%
Brother and sister-in-law have gone out.

349
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.120 line:82%
And I was scared to answer the phone.

350
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:51.080 line:82%
-Why?
-Why does he telephone me?

351
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.640 line:82%
What's there to be scared about?
All that the rascal does is telephone.

352
00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.680 line:82%
And it's up to oneself to disconnect
the phone whenever one wants.

353
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.240 line:82%
It's good that you came. I was terrified.

354
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.880 line:82%
There is nobody at home.

355
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.640 line:82%
-There's nobody at home?
-No.

356
00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.280 line:82%
-Nobody?
-Yes, nobody.

357
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.760 line:82%
In that case, shut the door.

358
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.160 line:82%
My suggestion is get married immediately.

359
00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.640 line:82%
After marriage,
such phone calls will stop.

360
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.520 line:82%
I'm happy about the excellent suggestion,
Lala Amarnath.

361
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.400 line:82%
Before my marriage,
I used to receive a lot of phone calls.

362
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.560 line:82%
-You know that, Kiran. Don't you?
-But we never had a telephone.

363
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.640 line:82%
But there was a phone
in our neighbor's place. You idiot!

364
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.880 line:82%
I used to get a lot of phone calls.

365
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.520 line:82%
In fact, an entire team
of girls had been chasing me.

366
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.720 line:82%
My condition was like that
of a lone player,

367
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.640 line:82%
who was being hounded by 11 players.

368
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.160 line:82%
I decided against scoring singles.
And so I hit a six.

369
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.920 line:82%
-And thus I got married to Poonam.
-Yes, of course!

370
00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.440 line:82%
-Then what.
-An entire team had been chasing you?

371
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.880 line:82%
You were in greater demand
than even Imran Khan?

372
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.920 line:82%
-What's Imran Khan in comparison?
-By the way,

373
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.400 line:82%
have you ever seen your face in the mirror
with the lights on?

374
00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.640 line:82%
Of course, I have.

375
00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.280 line:82%
It's difficult to make out
which is the face and which is the head.

376
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.320 line:82%
-What nonsense?
-An entire team was chasing him?

377
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.200 line:82%
You're making a fool of your husband?

378
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.880 line:82%
How can you join hands with her?
Your brother is being insulted.

379
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.080 line:82%
Come to Chandigarh and see
if you don't believe me.

380
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.840 line:82%
Ask the girls there.
You will know what my situation was.

381
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.120 line:82%
I will surely ask them
what they saw in you,

382
00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.080 line:82%
that I couldn't see in 10 years.

383
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.480 line:82%
You have never looked at me lovingly
in 10 years.

384
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.720 line:82%
You're getting emotional.
What's your problem?

385
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.240 line:82%
The issue was about us. And you started
your Mahabharata in between.

386
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.680 line:82%
This Mahabharata is a part
of every Indian home.

387
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.480 line:82%
Once you get married,
you will experience the same.

388
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.400 line:82%
-But how will we get married?
-Why?

389
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.520 line:82%
Only when you keep quiet
can we arrive at a decision.

390
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.200 line:82%
-You have... keep quiet.
-What is he saying?

391
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.560 line:82%
We've accepted your appeal.

392
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.160 line:82%
Go and ask for an extension of your leave
and start the second innings of your life.

393
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.360 line:82%
How are you, Sunil?

394
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.000 line:82%
Do I know you?

395
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.080 line:82%
No. But I know everything about you.

396
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.440 line:82%
I don't even know your name.

397
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.920 line:82%
My name is Rahul. And we're heading
towards the same destination.

398
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.400 line:82%
What's the destination?

399
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:14.840 line:82%
Captain Mehra.

400
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.360 line:82%
Captain Mehra?

401
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.720 line:82%
Yes. Captain Mehra is my Daddy.

402
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.040 line:82%
I'm glad to meet you.

403
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.640 line:82%
-Daddy often talks about you.
-About me?

404
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.280 line:82%
Yes. He says, if I were in the Navy,

405
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.880 line:82%
I would've become as famous as you are.

406
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.120 line:82%
But what do you do?

407
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.040 line:82%
-I love.
-Love?

408
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.600 line:82%
Is it a profession or a hobby?

409
00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.400 line:82%
Neither profession, nor a hobby.

410
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.000 line:82%
Love is life.

411
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.240 line:82%
You're right.

412
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.680 line:82%
If there is no love,
a human being does breathe,

413
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.720 line:82%
but he isn't living.

414
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.240 line:82%
Have you ever fallen in love?

415
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.280 line:82%
I'm in love,
and I'm going to marry her too.

416
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.920 line:82%
No, Mother. I've no objection
to Sunil's marriage.

417
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.520 line:82%
Neither do I've any enmity with him.
In fact, he is a very nice person.

418
00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.200 line:82%
But how can he marry Kiran?

419
00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.920 line:82%
Because Kiran is mine. Only mine.

420
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.280 line:82%
How can he steal Kiran from me?

421
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.320 line:82%
He's mad.

422
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.920 line:82%
Sunil is completely mad.

423
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.720 line:82%
He doesn't even realize
that it's a sin to separate true lovers.

424
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.280 line:82%
Isn't it, Mother?

425
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.360 line:82%
Even Kiran has been taken in
by his sweet talk.

426
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.760 line:82%
She's forgotten whom she belongs to.

427
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.680 line:82%
Mother,

428
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.360 line:82%
Kiran is very innocent.

429
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.720 line:82%
She doesn't listen to me.
She doesn't understand.

430
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.880 line:82%
That's because I explain to her lovingly.

431
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.280 line:82%
But now, I will have to explain to her
in another way.

432
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.320 line:82%
Oh, the lights.

433
00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.160 line:82%
Who's this?

434
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.040 line:82%
No!

435
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.320 line:82%
Sunil, it was you...

436
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.360 line:82%
I was only joking.

437
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.760 line:82%
Your joke will kill me some day.

438
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.360 line:82%
You will realize it when I die.

439
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.680 line:82%
That's impossible.

440
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.920 line:82%
How can a naval officer's girlfriend
drown to death?

441
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.440 line:82%
Never repeat such a prank again.
Otherwise I will truly die.

442
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.200 line:82%
Do you know, when you were pulling me
into the water.

443
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.320 line:82%
It felt like he was throttling me.

444
00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.520 line:82%
I feel very scared...

445
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.520 line:82%
Not of my death,
but of separating from you.

446
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.400 line:82%
I cannot live away from you.

447
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.680 line:82%
Darling, who can separate us?

448
00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.680 line:82%
There isn't enough space
between the two of us,

449
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.920 line:82%
that a third person could creep in.

450
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.400 line:82%
Greetings to all of you'll
from Vijay Awasthi.

451
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.240 line:82%
All the preparations are done.
The team is all ready.

452
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.360 line:82%
But besides the players,
there's nobody in the stadium.

453
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.320 line:82%
The batting will be opened by Kiran,
who has a knife in her hand,

454
00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:55.000 line:82%
and she is heading for the cake.
But let me inform all of you,

455
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.680 line:82%
that the commentator has paid
the 1600 rupees for the cake.

456
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.720 line:82%
I feel that you must've been born
on the cricket ground. Weren't you?

457
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.680 line:82%
A lot of thanks for the special comments,
Lala Amarnath.

458
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.400 line:82%
The candles have been lit.
Kiran has made her preparations.

459
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.720 line:82%
She has filled her mouth with air.
She's heading towards the candles.

460
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.440 line:82%
Umpire Sunil's signal is being awaited.

461
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.480 line:82%
Umpire Sunil has signaled.
And the candles are being extinguished!

462
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.240 line:82%
And most of the candles
have already been extinguished.

463
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.000 line:82%
She hasn't fed the cake to her brother
but perhaps she will do so soon.

464
00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.160 line:82%
And Sunil inserted the cake in her mouth,
and the lights have gone off.

465
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.680 line:82%
And I now request the commentator
to take me towards the fuse.

466
00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.280 line:82%
Sure. Kiran, take care, we will be back.

467
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.480 line:82%
And here I have fallen.

468
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.720 line:82%
And we are going towards the fuse.
No problem, I will do first aid.

469
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.320 line:82%
Sunil.

470
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.560 line:82%
What're you doing?

471
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.160 line:82%
Sunil.

472
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.640 line:82%
Sunil!

473
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.480 line:82%
He is somewhere here.

474
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.560 line:82%
He was here just a while ago.

475
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.720 line:82%
You are the picture of my dreams

476
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.080 line:82%
He's singing.

477
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.760 line:82%
You are my destiny itself, O ignorant one

478
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.520 line:82%
You are the picture of my dreams

479
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.760 line:82%
You are my destiny itself, O ignorant one

480
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.800 line:82%
Don't ever belong to someone else

481
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.400 line:82%
Or I could go to any lengths
That's how crazy I am

482
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.920 line:82%
The bastard has reached here too!

483
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.320 line:82%
But how did he enter inside?

484
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.560 line:82%
I think the matter has gone out of hand.

485
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.280 line:82%
We should inform the police.

486
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.040 line:82%
Go carefully.

487
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.520 line:82%
My gift?

488
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.760 line:82%
Hey! I forgot.

489
00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.160 line:82%
It doesn't matter. Give it to me now.

490
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.080 line:82%
Close your eyes.

491
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.000 line:82%
Today I've placed my heart on your heart.

492
00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.640 line:82%
I didn't know
that you've a heart of diamond.

493
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.080 line:82%
Whether made of stone or diamond,
a heart is a heart.

494
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.760 line:82%
It starts beating as soon as it receives
a little warmth of love.

495
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.120 line:82%
And what if I attach your real heart
with my heart?

496
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.160 line:82%
Then you will hear nothing,

497
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.760 line:82%
except for your name.

498
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.000 line:82%
-Let me speak to Kiran.
-Who are you speaking?

499
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.400 line:82%
Tell her she will receive
her birthday present in a short while.

500
00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.120 line:82%
But who is speaking?

501
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.560 line:82%
I've written my name on her cheeks.

502
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.440 line:82%
-Scoundrel!
-Whose phone was it?

503
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.760 line:82%
-That same person.
-What was he saying?

504
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.040 line:82%
He said she will get
her birthday present shortly.

505
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.520 line:82%
If I find him anywhere, I'll kill him.

506
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.320 line:82%
If it is his phone,
speak what I've instructed you.

507
00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.040 line:82%
Come on, answer the phone.

508
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.520 line:82%
Answer the phone.

509
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.680 line:82%
I'm feeling very scared.

510
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.360 line:82%
If you continue to be scared,

511
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.000 line:82%
you will have to live with this fear
all your life.

512
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.800 line:82%
Come on, answer the phone.

513
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.800 line:82%
You took a long time to answer the phone.

514
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.800 line:82%
Didn't I tell you to stop meeting Sunil?

515
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.840 line:82%
But you didn't listen to me.

516
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:03.200 line:82%
Now look, if anything happens to him,
I won't be responsible.

517
00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.880 line:82%
-You will be responsible.
-I will be responsible?

518
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.560 line:82%
I won't meet Sunil.

519
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.760 line:82%
I will do as you say.

520
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.520 line:82%
And what if you meet him?

521
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.720 line:82%
I will not meet him. Never.

522
00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.440 line:82%
But I want to meet you.

523
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.560 line:82%
-You intend to trap me?
-No. I want to see you.

524
00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.880 line:82%
I know it is dangerous.

525
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.040 line:82%
But I accept it for your sake.

526
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.680 line:82%
Let's meet tomorrow at the pool-side
restaurant in Holiday Inn.

527
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.360 line:82%
-But how will I recognize you?
-How will you recognize me?

528
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:55.280 line:82%
To recognize true love,
one doesn't need eyes, but the heart.

529
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.000 line:82%
When I appear before you,

530
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.240 line:82%
your heart beats will
recognize who has come.

531
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.760 line:82%
Moreover, I recognize you.

532
00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.000 line:82%
That scoundrel didn't reveal his identity.

533
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.600 line:82%
But I'm convinced
that he will surely come.

534
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.440 line:82%
I feel we shouldn't deal with this matter
all by ourselves.

535
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.320 line:82%
We should take the police with us.

536
00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.600 line:82%
Yes. If not the police,
at least take a few men along.

537
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.640 line:82%
One doesn't need an army to kill a rat.

538
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.120 line:82%
I'll be able to handle
that coward scoundrel.

539
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.560 line:82%
Did you recognize me?

540
00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.360 line:82%
I'm Rahul. Look at me closely.

541
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.520 line:82%
In the college crowd,
the boy who stood in the back.

542
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.080 line:82%
Who never had the courage
to appear before you.

543
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.560 line:82%
Who never dared to tell you
how much you mean to him.

544
00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.840 line:82%
The lips opened several times
to speak out to you,

545
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.240 line:82%
but the voice was never supportive.

546
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.880 line:82%
And today, the atmosphere
smells of the days gone by.

547
00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.200 line:82%
There's a glimmer of dreams in the eyes.

548
00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.600 line:82%
Today, both of us are face to face.

549
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.560 line:82%
And I want to tell you everything.

550
00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.760 line:82%
Try to make him speak for a longer time.

551
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.880 line:82%
Because it takes 3 to 4 minutes
to trace the phone number.

552
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.000 line:82%
Carry on, Kiran.

553
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.040 line:82%
Finally you did what I was scared of.

554
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.520 line:82%
-What did I do?
-You've cheated me!

555
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.720 line:82%
Did you think that I didn't know
that Sunil is hiding up there?

556
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.760 line:82%
So that when I come, I would be caught.

557
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.480 line:82%
I didn't know that Sunil was there.

558
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.000 line:82%
Perhaps you don't even know

559
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.680 line:82%
that right now a policeman
is standing next to you.

560
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.160 line:82%
On their instructions,
the telephone exchange

561
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.720 line:82%
is tracing the number.

562
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.360 line:82%
But don't worry, don't worry.

563
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.200 line:82%
Because it is not so easy to catch me.

564
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.160 line:82%
But I can meet you whenever I like.

565
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.600 line:82%
I will meet you tomorrow.

566
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.320 line:82%
Tomorrow is Holi. I'll play Holi with you.

567
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:22.520 line:82%
I will see how the red color
looks on your cheeks.

568
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.120 line:82%
He was acting smart
with Inspector Ajgaonkar!

569
00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.600 line:82%
We will soon know where
he was speaking from.

570
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.440 line:82%
What did you say?

571
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.560 line:82%
This is our bedroom number.

572
00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.440 line:82%
Why didn't you tell me
that you've another number too?

573
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.400 line:82%
But he always telephoned on this number.

574
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.360 line:82%
It's of no use.
The scoundrel must've slipped away.

575
00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.240 line:82%
What will happen now?

576
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.480 line:82%
I've invited so many people
to celebrate Holi.

577
00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.920 line:82%
-How will we handle them?
-We will. We will.

578
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.360 line:82%
He won't dare to come in the presence
of so many people.

579
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.320 line:82%
Like always, we will celebrate Holi
with great fanfare this year too.

580
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.040 line:82%
-You are never serious about anything.
-I am serious.

581
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.640 line:82%
How will we keep an eye
with so many people around?

582
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.080 line:82%
What if anything happens to Kiran?

583
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.320 line:82%
Let the scoundrel come.

584
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:31.040 line:82%
That which you feel like

585
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.480 line:82%
That which you feel like

586
00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.440 line:82%
You may do today

587
00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:44.000 line:82%
Take into your arms
The one you wish to hug

588
00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.640 line:82%
Make sure you hug me

589
00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:02.920 line:82%
When you douse the colors on me, My love

590
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:09.240 line:82%
Hug me, my love
When you douse the colors on me

591
00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:15.560 line:82%
Cheek to cheek

592
00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.480 line:82%
Eyeball to eyeball

593
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.280 line:82%
That's how the festival of colors
Ought to be today

594
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:27.360 line:82%
So make sure you sprinkle
The colors on me, my love

595
00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:33.840 line:82%
Hug me, my love
When you douse the colors on me

596
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:42.040 line:82%
Hug me, my love
When you douse the colors on me

597
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.440 line:82%
Apply the color only on the exterior
Do not go beyond that

598
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.920 line:82%
Say nothing, my love
Just stand here with your eyes closed

599
01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.040 line:82%
Don't let this woman from
The neighborhood get away

600
01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.400 line:82%
She mustn't return, if she goes away

601
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.280 line:82%
He was so wicked when he squeezed my arm

602
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.560 line:82%
My kohl, the flowers in my hair
He spared nothing

603
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.880 line:82%
So report it

604
01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.560 line:82%
So report it to the police

605
01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.760 line:82%
I'll pay a penalty

606
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:48.400 line:82%
Hug me, my love
When you douse the colors on me

607
01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:56.480 line:82%
Hug me, my love
When you douse the colors on me

608
01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:11.760 line:82%
The colors rain upon the veiled maiden

609
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.680 line:82%
The colors rain upon the veiled maiden

610
01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.720 line:82%
The colors rain upon the veiled maiden

611
01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.640 line:82%
Hold me in your arms

612
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.640 line:82%
Hold me in your arms
when you douse the colors on me, my love

613
01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:50.720 line:82%
The colors rain upon the veiled maiden

614
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.440 line:82%
From your drenched figure

615
01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.600 line:82%
Flames appear to leap

616
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.000 line:82%
Go your way, traveler

617
01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.640 line:82%
Your eyes are straying

618
01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.720 line:82%
I've lost my way

619
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.800 line:82%
You'd better find it

620
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.560 line:82%
May I take your arm

621
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.880 line:82%
Don't tease me, lover boy

622
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.040 line:82%
Don't break my heart

623
01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.120 line:82%
Let go of my scarf

624
01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.080 line:82%
What made you angry?

625
01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.320 line:82%
You broke my bangle

626
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.320 line:82%
I'm heart-broken too

627
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.520 line:82%
You're a liar

628
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.720 line:82%
If you dance, I'll sing

629
01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.840 line:82%
Sit here, I'm leaving

630
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.720 line:82%
It's difficult to go away

631
01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.360 line:82%
You're a madcap

632
01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.200 line:82%
Hold me in your arms

633
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.240 line:82%
If only you apply some color

634
01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.920 line:82%
Blue or yellow?

635
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.320 line:82%
Neither blue not yellow

636
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.560 line:82%
Red or pink?

637
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.080 line:82%
You tell him, sis-in-law

638
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.480 line:82%
With a pinch of vermilion

639
01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.440 line:82%
Take her for your bride

640
01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.840 line:82%
Hold me in your arms
When you douse colors on me, my love

641
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:45.200 line:82%
Hold me in your arms
When you douse colors on me, my love

642
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:53.360 line:82%
Hold me in your arms
When you douse colors on me, my love

643
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.160 line:82%
Didn't I tell you that he wouldn't come?

644
01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.120 line:82%
And you even celebrated Holi merrily.
So shall we leave now?

645
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.240 line:82%
-All right, then.
-Thanks a lot.

646
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.200 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-To take a bath.

647
01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.160 line:82%
It's very enjoyable to bathe together
after playing Holi.

648
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.760 line:82%
-Enough of it.
-In that case, let's play cricket.

649
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.200 line:82%
-Stop talking nonsense.
-Only one over.

650
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.920 line:82%
-Why're you following me?
-To take a bath.

651
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.080 line:82%
Have you gone mad?

652
01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.840 line:82%
It's fun to bathe together
after playing Holi.

653
01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.400 line:82%
You shameless fellow!

654
01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.240 line:82%
They haven't been rewarded.
Do you have money?

655
01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.320 line:82%
I will take it back.

656
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.560 line:82%
I'm waiting for you in the tub.

657
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.560 line:82%
Wish you a happy Holi.

658
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.760 line:82%
Happy Holi.

659
01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.880 line:82%
Happy Holi, Kiran.

660
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.640 line:82%
Sunil.

661
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.720 line:82%
Sunil.

662
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.040 line:82%
-Which way did he go?
-There...

663
01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480 line:82%
Take it easy, Sunil.

664
01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.680 line:82%
Who are you searching for?

665
01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:58.920 line:82%
Hello...

666
01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.560 line:82%
You didn't do the right thing.

667
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.000 line:82%
You shouldn't have hit me.

668
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:28.480 line:82%
But now you will have to pay
for every drop of blood.

669
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.840 line:82%
For every drop of blood.

670
01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:43.120 line:82%
-A parcel has arrived for you.
-How nice. So early in the morning.

671
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.440 line:82%
-Who has brought it?
-I'm not aware who brought it.

672
01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:52.200 line:82%
When I reached the door,
I found this packet lying by the door.

673
01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.600 line:82%
I'm leaving. I've a lot of work to do.

674
01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.360 line:82%
I have to serve breakfast for sir.

675
01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.680 line:82%
Don't be afraid.

676
01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.320 line:82%
This is not Sunil's blood, but mine.

677
01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.040 line:82%
Which flowed when Sunil's stone hit me.

678
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.400 line:82%
Now my stones are waiting for Sunil.

679
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.320 line:82%
Tell him that every drop of blood
will be accounted for.

680
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.760 line:82%
Let me speak to Sunil.
Where has he gone? Which friend's house?

681
01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.040 line:82%
Remember to attend the wedding.

682
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.400 line:82%
How can you say that?
Of course, I will attend your wedding.

683
01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.120 line:82%
Sunil.

684
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.800 line:82%
Sunil.

685
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.880 line:82%
What happened?

686
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.160 line:82%
What difference would it make
if we are married a few days later.

687
01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.320 line:82%
You've lost faith in me.

688
01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.120 line:82%
because I haven't been able to catch
that scoundrel.

689
01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.520 line:82%
I could not punish him.

690
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.640 line:82%
So you're scared
that I won't be able to protect you.

691
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.480 line:82%
Yes, I am scared. But not for myself.

692
01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.040 line:82%
I'm not bothered even if he kills me.

693
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.080 line:82%
But if something were to happen
to my beloved,

694
01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.640 line:82%
what will happen of me?

695
01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:21.800 line:82%
Darling, one who has you,
your love, your trust,

696
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.880 line:82%
nobody can harm such a person.

697
01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.160 line:82%
Tell me something, Kiran.

698
01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.440 line:82%
Even though girls spread their nets
in the whole of the ocean,

699
01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.160 line:82%
to catch the fish and yet the fish
remained elusive.

700
01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.360 line:82%
How could you catch the fish?

701
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.320 line:82%
Answer him.

702
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.840 line:82%
That is how it is.
Fishes who break through biggest of nets,

703
01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.800 line:82%
get trapped in a small hook.

704
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.080 line:82%
-You don't have a sister, do you?
-No, why?

705
01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.480 line:82%
If you had,
I would've got Rahul married to her.

706
01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.000 line:82%
All right, Sir. We are leaving.
A lot of cards have to be distributed.

707
01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.720 line:82%
But do attend the marriage.
And bring along Rahul too.

708
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.360 line:82%
-Was someone here?
-Yes, Sunil had come.

709
01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.760 line:82%
-Who was accompanying him?
-His fiancée, Kiran.

710
01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.040 line:82%
-Kiran had come here?
-You know her?

711
01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:33.600 line:82%
Yes.

712
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.520 line:82%
She's a very nice girl.

713
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.120 line:82%
If you ask me, you should find a girl
like Kiran for yourself.

714
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.840 line:82%
Life will become easy.

715
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.680 line:82%
There can be no girl like Kiran.

716
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.160 line:82%
You're absolutely right.
That's why she has got such a good boy.

717
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.440 line:82%
This is Sunil's marriage invitation.
And he insists that you must attend.

718
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.640 line:82%
I'm pressurizing you for marriage because,

719
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.680 line:82%
how long would you live alone?

720
01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:14.000 line:82%
Every ship needs an anchor
at some point of time.

721
01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.080 line:82%
No.

722
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:32.800 line:82%
No.

723
01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.640 line:82%
This marriage cannot take place.

724
01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:40.840 line:82%
No.

725
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.360 line:82%
You can not belong to anybody else. Never!

726
01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:09.800 line:82%
Because if it happens,
nobody will love anybody else.

727
01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.040 line:82%
People will begin to hate love.

728
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.160 line:82%
No, Kiran!

729
01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400 line:82%
Don't do this!

730
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.880 line:82%
Don't do it please!

731
01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.080 line:82%
Don't punish me so severely.

732
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.920 line:82%
I'm living today on the strength
of your love and your pictures.

733
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.440 line:82%
If you take away even one thing from me,
what will happen of me?

734
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.640 line:82%
I've nothing except your love.

735
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.520 line:82%
What will I do?

736
01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.480 line:82%
No!

737
01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.200 line:82%
This is not the time to weep.

738
01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.760 line:82%
Kiran's life is in danger.

739
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.080 line:82%
You will have to rescue her.

740
01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.440 line:82%
You will have to do something.

741
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.000 line:82%
Look at this sister-in-law!

742
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.680 line:82%
Look at this one. I find this attractive.

743
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.000 line:82%
-It looks beautiful.
-Yes.

744
01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.040 line:82%
Let's buy this.

745
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.280 line:82%
How about a gold one too?
Let's see a longer one.

746
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.280 line:82%
-How about that?
-Show us that one.

747
01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.760 line:82%
-Look at this one.
-Yes.

748
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.080 line:82%
How about this one?

749
01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.480 line:82%
-Couldn't you have sat quietly?
-How do I know it'd get stuck?

750
01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.880 line:82%
-You stick things wherever you can.
-You've started it again here too?

751
01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.360 line:82%
-The ring has got stuck.
-Why did you wear it?

752
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.280 line:82%
I didn't know that it would get stuck.

753
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.080 line:82%
-What should we do now?
-Don't worry.

754
01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.280 line:82%
-We will cut it and remove it.
-The finger?

755
01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:04.520 line:82%
Madam, how can we cut customer's fingers?

756
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.320 line:82%
Pack these two sets.

757
01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.120 line:82%
And deliver this to our home.

758
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.760 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Thank God.

759
01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.040 line:82%
-Thanks.
-I will get the car.

760
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.440 line:82%
-Hold on. We're coming.
-Let me make the payment.

761
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.480 line:82%
Meanwhile, you try some other ring.

762
01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.760 line:82%
-Here it is.
-Shall we leave?

763
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:42.040 line:82%
But one thing is for sure.
You looked lovely wearing the ladies ring.

764
01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.560 line:82%
All right. I made a mistake.

765
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.720 line:82%
Kiran!

766
01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.560 line:82%
Doctor, how is Sunil?

767
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.920 line:82%
Nothing can be said for at least 24 hours.

768
01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.200 line:82%
-Can I meet him?
-You can only see him.

769
01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.800 line:82%
Because he is still unconscious.

770
01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.840 line:82%
Your life is in danger because of me.

771
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.520 line:82%
I cannot bear to see it.

772
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.680 line:82%
I'm going far away from you.

773
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.360 line:82%
For good.

774
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.600 line:82%
Lord, please protect my Sunil's life.

775
01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.120 line:82%
His life is my life.

776
01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.120 line:82%
Make him recover at the earliest.

777
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.800 line:82%
It's not that I am happy at being saved,
or grief at being injured.

778
01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.640 line:82%
But I'm furious that though
the scoundrel was so close to me,

779
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.760 line:82%
still he slipped out of my hands.

780
01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.320 line:82%
I feel your unseen enemy
is somewhat insane.

781
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.920 line:82%
He doesn't even understand
the simple thing

782
01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.160 line:82%
that to win a girl,
it's important to win over her heart.

783
01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.880 line:82%
Murdering the fiancé
won't get him the girl.

784
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.000 line:82%
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

785
01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:32.880 line:82%
You are fine?

786
01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.480 line:82%
You're been amazing. You survived
despite being hit by a bullet.

787
01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.080 line:82%
I'm glad about that.

788
01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.200 line:82%
If someone is murdered in public,
things get difficult for us.

789
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.760 line:82%
Then we have to take testimony
of everybody in the market.

790
01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.920 line:82%
That reminds me,
I've to take your statement.

791
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:47.920 line:82%
Go ahead.

792
01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.280 line:82%
Did you see anybody firing at you?

793
01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.640 line:82%
No.

794
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.000 line:82%
You chased him a great distance
and still didn't see a thing?

795
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.280 line:82%
Just his jacket and jeans.

796
01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.640 line:82%
Nothing else.

797
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.680 line:82%
What about his height?

798
01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.120 line:82%
Height?

799
01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.800 line:82%
-He must be of Rahuls height.
-5 feet 10 inches.

800
01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:09.920 line:82%
What?

801
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.080 line:82%
My height.

802
01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.240 line:82%
Anyhow, we shall leave.

803
01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.240 line:82%
Let's go, Rahul.

804
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.760 line:82%
Beware of your unknown enemy's
next attack.

805
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.280 line:82%
The next attack will be mine, not his.

806
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.920 line:82%
All right, Sir. I'll leave too.

807
01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.320 line:82%
Kiran, where are you going?

808
01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.120 line:82%
Tell me.

809
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.800 line:82%
In this manner, quietly,
without informing anybody.

810
01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.480 line:82%
Without meeting me, why're you going away?

811
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.400 line:82%
Tell me. What's the matter?

812
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.280 line:82%
I'm not leaving. Where am I leaving?

813
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.720 line:82%
I can never leave this city.

814
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.200 line:82%
The breeze which contains
the fragrance of your breath,

815
01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.200 line:82%
the land which has been walked all over
by you,

816
01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.800 line:82%
How can I leave that place?

817
01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.360 line:82%
Kiran is a threat for your well-being.

818
01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:01.920 line:82%
You've been attacked twice because of me.

819
01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.200 line:82%
A third one is also possible.

820
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.360 line:82%
And I cannot tolerate any harm
being caused to you.

821
01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.120 line:82%
That's why Kiran
will have to go away from here.

822
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.280 line:82%
Kiran cannot live here.

823
01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.520 line:82%
Lift your head, look into my eyes.

824
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.240 line:82%
What do you see in these eyes?

825
01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.320 line:82%
Do these eyes belong to a weak man,

826
01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:41.320 line:82%
who would close his eyes
upon coming face-to-face with death?

827
01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.440 line:82%
Look at these hands.
Are they not strong enough

828
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.520 line:82%
to throttle some coward to death?

829
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.480 line:82%
Look at these wounds,
they are proof of the fact

830
01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.200 line:82%
that a body which contains love
in the form of blood.

831
01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.240 line:82%
such a body can not be cut into pieces.

832
01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.600 line:82%
Before giving up hope
in the face of unseen fear.

833
01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.680 line:82%
You had better check out the strength
of these arms.

834
01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.840 line:82%
You should have checked whether
the shoulder on which you lean

835
01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.680 line:82%
can bear the burden
of your protection or not?

836
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:20.480 line:82%
No, Sunil.
Don't stop me. Please let me go.

837
01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:25.120 line:82%
I can die, but I cannot see you dying.

838
01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.200 line:82%
I beg of you. Please let me go.

839
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.680 line:82%
All right. You may go. I won't stop you.

840
01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.120 line:82%
But wherever you go,
you will go after becoming mine.

841
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.800 line:82%
You will go as Mrs. Sunil Malhotra.

842
01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.120 line:82%
Go! Go wherever you like!

843
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000 line:82%
In the name of my flowing blood,

844
01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.480 line:82%
in the name of the person
which is written on my heart.

845
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.240 line:82%
You are mine, only mine.

846
01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.480 line:82%
These rituals round the fire,
the hymns, they are all a fraud.

847
01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.360 line:82%
Sunil has cheated you.

848
01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.040 line:82%
The vermilion that he has put
on your forehead

849
01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.560 line:82%
will be washed away with his own blood.

850
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.400 line:82%
That's a promise!

851
01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.040 line:82%
My mother

852
01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:57.320 line:82%
My mother has sewn
Sixteen buttons on my blouse

853
01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.760 line:82%
Dear father

854
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:09.280 line:82%
Father, hurry up and see me off
In a bridal palanquin soon

855
01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:16.560 line:82%
My mother has sewn
Sixteen buttons on my blouse

856
01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.640 line:82%
Dear father

857
01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.720 line:82%
Father, hurry up and see me off
In a bridal palanquin soon

858
01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:33.120 line:82%
Father, hurry up and see me off
In a bridal palanquin soon

859
01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.800 line:82%
Seventeen bells in my anklets

860
01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:48.440 line:82%
For I've turned seventeen

861
01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.440 line:82%
This is the age

862
01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:56.520 line:82%
This was the age when
Sohni fell in love with Mahiwal

863
01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:03.840 line:82%
This was the age when
Sohni fell in love with Mahiwal

864
01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.000 line:82%
My hands

865
01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.520 line:82%
I wear eighteen bangles

866
01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.080 line:82%
And I keep dancing

867
01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:30.320 line:82%
I've abandoned my modesty
To dance with gay abandon

868
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:42.040 line:82%
I've abandoned my modesty
To dance with gay abandon

869
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.640 line:82%
In a fake beard and mustache

870
01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.640 line:82%
The wicked one really deceived me

871
01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:22.400 line:82%
He came in the disguise of a tailor

872
01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.840 line:82%
And took my measurements

873
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.600 line:82%
He came in the disguise of a tailor

874
01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.520 line:82%
And took my measurements

875
01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.440 line:82%
How do I give? How do I give?

876
01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.200 line:82%
How will I give away
My heart to you, my love?

877
01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.880 line:82%
My heart isn't trivia

878
01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:57.880 line:82%
How am I to accept your bangles?

879
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000 line:82%
It could be a ploy you're using

880
01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.240 line:82%
I didn't approve of any suitor

881
01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:16.720 line:82%
I refused to get married

882
01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:23.800 line:82%
But when his name came up

883
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:28.000 line:82%
I agreed immediately

884
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:52.640 line:82%
From my piercing eyes

885
01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:57.200 line:82%
He has stolen what they possessed

886
01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:02.160 line:82%
I stepped out of the lake after a bath

887
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:06.640 line:82%
And he took away a picture of mine

888
01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.680 line:82%
Give him something

889
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.600 line:82%
What?

890
01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:18.640 line:82%
Give him something and ask him
To return your picture to you

891
01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.040 line:82%
Do it before

892
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:30.800 line:82%
Do it before he hangs your picture
At the square

893
01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:37.840 line:82%
Do it before he hangs your picture
At the square

894
01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:10.760 line:82%
Ravi Shastri was awarded an Audi
for 'Man Of The Series'.

895
01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.480 line:82%
I'm not giving you an Audi,

896
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.280 line:82%
but someone who is dearer to me
than my life.

897
01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.040 line:82%
-Take care of her.
-Brother.

898
01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:29.920 line:82%
You take care of me.

899
01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.280 line:82%
You'll start a new life together
from today.

900
01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.840 line:82%
These two constables will remain with you
for your safety.

901
01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.400 line:82%
They are not necessary.

902
01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.160 line:82%
I can protect Kiran and myself.

903
01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.880 line:82%
One should always remain on guard
from the unseen enemy.

904
01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.720 line:82%
As it is, they will stay outside.

905
01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.120 line:82%
-You'll the lift.
-Yes.

906
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:12.640 line:82%
And us?

907
01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.560 line:82%
It's a custom that when the bride
comes home for the first time,

908
01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.880 line:82%
the bridegroom lifts her
and takes her inside the home.

909
01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.880 line:82%
Think it over.
Our home is on the 7th floor.

910
01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.480 line:82%
And I am quite heavy.

911
01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.240 line:82%
If you are prepared
to give me the labor charges,

912
01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.840 line:82%
I am prepared to lift this weight
right up to the 50th floor.

913
01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.680 line:82%
What labor charge do you desire?

914
01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.440 line:82%
Love on every step.

915
01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.040 line:82%
-You're tired, aren't you?
-You forgot.

916
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.520 line:82%
-What?
-My labor charge.

917
01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.600 line:82%
-Just a minute.
-What happened?

918
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:12.520 line:82%
My sandal!

919
01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.320 line:82%
Hey. This is cheating.

920
01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.560 line:82%
You've already taken the labor charge
for this step.

921
01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:30.600 line:82%
This is overtime. It was not within
the contract to pick up the sandal.

922
01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:31.920 line:82%
Okay, okay.

923
01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.440 line:82%
If I could have my way,
I would never have allowed you

924
01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.320 line:82%
-to take a home at such a height.
-If I could have my way,

925
01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.160 line:82%
I would've bought a home in the sky.

926
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.080 line:82%
I would've continued to climb the stairs
all my life with you close to my heart.

927
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.360 line:82%
Go upstairs!

928
01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:08.840 line:82%
Sunil!

929
01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.160 line:82%
Kiran!

930
01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.520 line:82%
Congratulations on the marriage.

931
01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.320 line:82%
Are you all right?

932
01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:47.400 line:82%
Congratulations on the marriage.

933
01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.320 line:82%
Kiran.

934
01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.200 line:82%
Kiran!

935
01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.280 line:82%
Congratulations on the marriage.

936
01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.280 line:82%
Kiran!

937
01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.280 line:82%
Congratulations...

938
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.000 line:82%
It's a small house, but

939
01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:26.040 line:82%
I hope you will like it

940
01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:39.160 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

941
01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:44.800 line:82%
Don't ever belong to someone else

942
01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:50.680 line:82%
Or I could go to any lengths
That's how crazy I am

943
01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.680 line:82%
From the skies, I will seek you

944
01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:03.040 line:82%
From this world, I shall snatch you away

945
01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.160 line:82%
Say yes

946
01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:08.920 line:82%
Or say no

947
01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:15.000 line:82%
Whether you say yes or no
You are mine, Kiran

948
01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:21.080 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

949
01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.160 line:82%
Kiran!

950
01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.080 line:82%
-Sunil!
-Kiran!

951
01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:33.840 line:82%
Sunil...

952
01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:36.720 line:82%
What happened?

953
01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.720 line:82%
Look. He is telephoning me again.

954
01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.480 line:82%
Nobody is telephoning.
Nobody is telephoning.

955
01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:46.840 line:82%
No.

956
01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.120 line:82%
Come on, stand up.

957
01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.040 line:82%
-You didn't hear any bell?
-No, I heard nothing.

958
01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.840 line:82%
Come on, sit down.

959
01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:10.840 line:82%
Look! The phone is ringing again.
Can you hearing the ringing?

960
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.760 line:82%
Don't lift the phone.

961
01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.120 line:82%
I know whose phone it is.
Don't lift the phone.

962
01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.920 line:82%
I disconnected the line.

963
01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.160 line:82%
I didn't want anybody to disturb you.

964
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.680 line:82%
Darling, nobody is telephoning.

965
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.000 line:82%
No one.

966
01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:33.560 line:82%
No one.

967
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.360 line:82%
-Nobody is telephoning?
-No.

968
01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:38.560 line:82%
Then...

969
01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.480 line:82%
Save me. I don't want to turn mad.

970
01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.440 line:82%
Please save me.
I don't want to become mad.

971
01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.760 line:82%
I don't want to become mad.

972
01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.400 line:82%
I don't want to become mad.

973
01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.480 line:82%
Please save me.

974
01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.360 line:82%
-I want to resign.
-No, Sunil. No!

975
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.160 line:82%
You are a Marine Commando.

976
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.480 line:82%
And it is our tradition
that when a ship is sinking,

977
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.200 line:82%
even then the captain
doesn't leave the ship.

978
01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.040 line:82%
There's an ordinary storm in your life

979
01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.840 line:82%
and you want to give up everything?
What kind of an officer are you?

980
01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:34.080 line:82%
Face the storm,
and bring your ship to the shore.

981
01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:37.000 line:82%
-Be brave.
-But, Sir.

982
01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.440 line:82%
I will try and get your leave extended.

983
01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:43.360 line:82%
You will do me such a big obligation?

984
01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.560 line:82%
It's not an obligation.

985
01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.800 line:82%
I don't want to lose a good officer
like you.

986
01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.040 line:82%
I will come back
as soon as Kiran recovers.

987
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.360 line:82%
Where are you taking her?

988
01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.760 line:82%
I haven't decided.

989
01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.520 line:82%
But I want to take her somewhere far away.

990
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.640 line:82%
Thank you.

991
01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:04.920 line:82%
Just remember this thing.

992
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.320 line:82%
As long as the fruit is on the tree,
it looks good.

993
01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.400 line:82%
Once it is in one's hands,
it's right place is between the teeth.

994
01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:12.800 line:82%
When a lover becomes a husband,
he changes color.

995
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:16.680 line:82%
-No! My Sunil will never change.
-Is it?

996
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.200 line:82%
-What happened?
-Why're you weeping?

997
01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.120 line:82%
By seeing both of you
going on your honeymoon.

998
01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.280 line:82%
I've been reminded of my honeymoon.

999
01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.360 line:82%
-You had been on a honeymoon?
-Yes.

1000
01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.000 line:82%
-Where?
-To Brabourne Stadium.

1001
01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:35.240 line:82%
Nobody would've celebrated
my honeymoon the way I did.

1002
01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.600 line:82%
Shameless fellow. Does one tell people
about one's honeymoon?

1003
01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:40.840 line:82%
I had celebrated my honeymoon
in public. Do you know how?

1004
01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.640 line:82%
You had even celebrated? What did you do?

1005
01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.880 line:82%
It was night. The flood-lights were on.

1006
01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.840 line:82%
The invitees were on the pitch.
And then...

1007
01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.760 line:82%
-In the presence of everybody?
-He's lying. An absolute lie!

1008
01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:57.320 line:82%
One speaks the truth
only during a cricket commentary.

1009
01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.120 line:82%
Because there's no chance of lying.

1010
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.600 line:82%
-We're leaving.
-Carry on.

1011
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.440 line:82%
My prayers are with you.

1012
01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.600 line:82%
May the Lord make you successful
in this test match itself.

1013
01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.920 line:82%
-Bless you.
-Brother.

1014
01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.200 line:82%
Sister-in-law.

1015
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.920 line:82%
-You'll receive a beating.
-I too will touch her feet!

1016
01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:30.840 line:82%
My darling...

1017
01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.440 line:82%
How could you start talking
about our honeymoon?

1018
01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.200 line:82%
You just can't keep your tongue
under check.

1019
01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.400 line:82%
-What?
-That's too much.

1020
01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.400 line:82%
Please tell me on which flight
Mr. and Mrs. Malhotra are traveling.

1021
01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.320 line:82%
I cannot give out information
about passengers.

1022
01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.440 line:82%
I've to give an important message to them.

1023
01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:58.640 line:82%
-Please?
-Sorry.

1024
01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.160 line:82%
I cannot reveal about them.

1025
01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:09.760 line:82%
All right, Madam.

1026
01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.760 line:82%
You perform your duty.

1027
01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.320 line:82%
But remember, an innocent child
who has just been orphaned.

1028
01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.920 line:82%
A young girl who has been widowed
just an hour ago.

1029
01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.240 line:82%
They will never forgive you.

1030
01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.440 line:82%
-What are you saying?
-Yes, Madam.

1031
01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.240 line:82%
Your passengers,
Mr. and Mrs. Malhotra will curse you.

1032
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.120 line:82%
Because they will be celebrating
their honeymoon there

1033
01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.280 line:82%
and his brother
will be cremated by strangers.

1034
01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.680 line:82%
Has Mr. Malhotra's brother passed away?

1035
01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.440 line:82%
Yes, Madam.
That's why I've come rushing here.

1036
01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.640 line:82%
It's very important
to convey this message to Sunil.

1037
01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.160 line:82%
I will check.

1038
01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.000 line:82%
S. Malhotra. K. Malhotra,
flight 207 to Goa.

1039
01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:00.880 line:82%
Goa?

1040
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.560 line:82%
Yes. But the flight has already taken off.

1041
01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.000 line:82%
-The message cannot be conveyed.
-It doesn't matter.

1042
01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.000 line:82%
-I will personally go to Goa.
-Okay.

1043
01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.840 line:82%
I'm coming, Kiran.

1044
01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:26.040 line:82%
Tell me something, we came till here.
But we aren't going to Goa. Why?

1045
01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.440 line:82%
We're not going to Goa,
but to Switzerland.

1046
01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:30.640 line:82%
Switzerland!

1047
01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.480 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

1048
01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:35.320 line:82%
Our flight will take off
from the International Airport in 2 hours.

1049
01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.600 line:82%
Then why did you purchase these tickets
to Goa?

1050
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.680 line:82%
Because now I have started thinking
like that scoundrel!

1051
01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.000 line:82%
By now he must have checked
that we've gone to Goa.

1052
01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.320 line:82%
And he must be preparing to leave for Goa.

1053
01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.600 line:82%
He will reach Goa,
and we will reach Switzerland.

1054
01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:58.000 line:82%
I like you when you speak
so intelligently.

1055
01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:09.920 line:82%
Mr. and Mrs. Malhotra
aren't staying in our hotel.

1056
01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:16.000 line:82%
Are Mr. and Mrs. Malhotra
staying in your hotel?

1057
01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.320 line:82%
Why're you asking?

1058
01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.680 line:82%
I'm their friend. I've to meet them.

1059
01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.320 line:82%
Did your friend not give you
the right address?

1060
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.720 line:82%
He did give the address. But I've lost it.

1061
01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.720 line:82%
That's why I'm searching every hotel.

1062
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.480 line:82%
What's the need to search for them
in every hotel?

1063
01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.520 line:82%
Do you intend to collect your dues?

1064
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.640 line:82%
Just check and tell me
if Sunil Malhotra is staying here.

1065
01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.040 line:82%
You're screaming at me?
Now I will never tell you.

1066
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:40.400 line:82%
Please don't get angry.

1067
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.840 line:82%
Please check and tell me
if Mr. and Mrs. Malhotra are staying here.

1068
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.480 line:82%
There's no Malhotra here.

1069
01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.800 line:82%
From where do such people come
and harass me?

1070
01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:13.440 line:82%
Who are you to stop me?
Pour four glasses into it.

1071
01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:17.000 line:82%
-It will spill over, Sir.
-So be it. It's my liquor.

1072
01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.400 line:82%
What have you got to do with it?
I'm paying for it. Come on. Pour!

1073
01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:21.600 line:82%
Come on!

1074
01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:24.920 line:82%
Vikram?

1075
01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.000 line:82%
It's me?

1076
01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:31.920 line:82%
Give me five!

1077
01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.880 line:82%
How come you are here?

1078
01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:38.160 line:82%
-We never met after college.
-Yes.

1079
01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:41.280 line:82%
-How are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?

1080
01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.280 line:82%
I'm fine.

1081
01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.400 line:82%
After meeting you,
I am reminded of our college days.

1082
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.720 line:82%
Jokes and laughter, enjoyment,
mischief all day long.

1083
01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.240 line:82%
Teasing and making fun of people.

1084
01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.640 line:82%
Hello, one more.

1085
01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.400 line:82%
-For my friend.
-Get it, get it!

1086
01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:09.000 line:82%
What are you doing?

1087
01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:11.000 line:82%
Forget it.

1088
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.400 line:82%
If this intoxication were not there
it would be difficult to live life.

1089
01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.640 line:82%
You tell me! What happened of that girl
who you were crazy about?

1090
01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:27.560 line:82%
-Did you get her or no?
-I will get her.

1091
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.520 line:82%
Make sure you call me.

1092
01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.760 line:82%
The letters written by you
which you deposited with me,

1093
01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:37.760 line:82%
all her belongings
which you had deposited with me.

1094
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.080 line:82%
Even today, all those things are with me.

1095
01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.520 line:82%
-Very good.
-I will present it to her.

1096
01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:47.280 line:82%
And if I pass away,
give it to her as a gift from me.

1097
01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.720 line:82%
Come on, now. Don't speak of death.

1098
01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:54.160 line:82%
You've to live for a long time.

1099
01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:55.720 line:82%
It's tough.

1100
01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:58.840 line:82%
The liver is not efficient.

1101
01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.560 line:82%
The heart too is in a delicate state.

1102
01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:07.440 line:82%
There's a cat-and-mouse game
going on between me and life.

1103
01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:11.040 line:82%
God knows when the cat
will catch the mouse.

1104
01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.480 line:82%
-For your long life.
-No, no ,no.

1105
01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.320 line:82%
What was the name of your girlfriend?

1106
01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:33.600 line:82%
Kiran.

1107
01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:10.440 line:82%
It's etched on the winds

1108
01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:14.760 line:82%
It's inscribed on the mountains

1109
01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:20.800 line:82%
You and I were made for each other

1110
01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.800 line:82%
It's etched on the winds

1111
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.840 line:82%
It's inscribed on the mountains

1112
01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:36.880 line:82%
You and I are made for each other

1113
01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:12.800 line:82%
For this beautiful legend of love

1114
01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:16.880 line:82%
You and I have descended from the skies

1115
01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:21.000 line:82%
These moments and the stories of love

1116
01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:25.120 line:82%
Bring two youngsters together

1117
01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.760 line:82%
Together we tread the path of love

1118
01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:33.800 line:82%
It's etched on the winds

1119
01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:37.840 line:82%
It's inscribed on the mountains

1120
01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:44.040 line:82%
You and I are made for each other

1121
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:14.520 line:82%
Keep smiling just like this

1122
01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:18.640 line:82%
Biting the end of your scarf in shyness

1123
01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.880 line:82%
Do away with the veil of your tresses

1124
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:27.120 line:82%
Let me see your pretty face

1125
01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:31.120 line:82%
Proud, lithesome

1126
01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:35.240 line:82%
Walk up to me

1127
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.640 line:82%
For these are the traits I so dearly love

1128
01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:43.520 line:82%
It's all over the winds

1129
01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.680 line:82%
The mountains bear testimony

1130
01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:54.200 line:82%
You and I are made for each other

1131
01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.640 line:82%
Let's tell the world today

1132
01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:40.880 line:82%
We love each other more than our own lives

1133
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.560 line:82%
In the victory and defeat of love

1134
01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:48.600 line:82%
Of what consequence is my heart

1135
01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:53.160 line:82%
I've laid my life at your feet

1136
01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:57.400 line:82%
It's all over the winds

1137
01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.600 line:82%
The mountains bear testimony

1138
01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:05.560 line:82%
You and I

1139
01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:09.040 line:82%
Are made for each other

1140
01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:13.880 line:82%
It's etched on the winds

1141
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000 line:82%
It's inscribed on the mountains

1142
01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:24.000 line:82%
You and I are made for each other

1143
01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.080 line:82%
It's a sixer!

1144
01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.360 line:82%
I'm Rahul!

1145
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.040 line:82%
Fool. You've dropped a simple catch.

1146
01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:18.000 line:82%
-Captain Mehra is my father.
-I see, Sunil's boss!

1147
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.880 line:82%
Looks like you are very fond of cricket.

1148
01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.160 line:82%
-You're also playing?
-I don't play now.

1149
01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:32.720 line:82%
I used to play in Chandigarh
representing Punjab University.

1150
01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.200 line:82%
-How is Sunil?
-Where is he playing?

1151
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:40.400 line:82%
-Not Gavaskar. Your Sunil.
-You didn't attend the wedding?

1152
01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:43.200 line:82%
No, I wasn't in town.
Where is he these days?

1153
01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:46.280 line:82%
Where does a man go after marriage?
To the place where dreams are made.

1154
01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.160 line:82%
-He is on his honeymoon?
-Yes.

1155
01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:49.280 line:82%
Where?

1156
01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.440 line:82%
You were asking something?

1157
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.360 line:82%
You were telling me where Sunil has gone.

1158
01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:03.160 line:82%
He must've gone...
Hey! This wicket is very important.

1159
01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.400 line:82%
Thank you.

1160
01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:29.800 line:82%
Whatever you say,

1161
01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.440 line:82%
but if any of their players
had hit a four in the final overs,

1162
01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:36.160 line:82%
-their team was sure to win.
-That's what I was telling you.

1163
01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.480 line:82%
If I was a part of their team,
we would've surely won the match.

1164
01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.040 line:82%
You always say that if you played,
we would have won.

1165
01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:43.080 line:82%
Don't you interfere. It's because of you

1166
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.520 line:82%
that I'm not a part of the Indian
team along with Gavaskar and Kapil Dev.

1167
01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.080 line:82%
-Why?
-She put forth a rule,

1168
01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.240 line:82%
that either I should marry her,
or join the Indian team.

1169
01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.920 line:82%
What proof did you have
that you know how to play cricket?

1170
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:53.760 line:82%
The proof is that I got married to you.
And another problem was

1171
01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.440 line:82%
that there had to be someone
to look after my sister, Kiran.

1172
01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:59.120 line:82%
-Now you've come to the point.
-What's the need to say that?

1173
01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:03.240 line:82%
Sunil appeared worried before marriage.

1174
01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:07.120 line:82%
Daddy was saying that some boy
telephones your sister and harasses her

1175
01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.360 line:82%
Dog! Rascal! Scoundrel!

1176
01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:12.600 line:82%
He's not a boy, he's a ghost.

1177
01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:16.280 line:82%
He had made life difficult for us.
Whenever the phone rang,

1178
01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:18.920 line:82%
we used to panic.
Kiran had even become half-mad.

1179
01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:21.800 line:82%
Just see, he will die such a death

1180
01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.800 line:82%
that even dogs
wouldn't touch his dead body.

1181
01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.920 line:82%
He has been cursed by me.

1182
01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.800 line:82%
She had cursed me too.
And I became her husband.

1183
01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:34.240 line:82%
What? Is it a curse to be my husband?

1184
01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.120 line:82%
-It's a curse to be a husband.
-It's a greater curse to be a wife.

1185
01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:39.040 line:82%
What do you mean?

1186
01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.200 line:82%
-Every time!
-You just...

1187
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.480 line:82%
Everything is fine after marriage,
isn't it?

1188
01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.360 line:82%
-Yes.
-Everything is fine so far.

1189
01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:51.400 line:82%
But who can trust a scoundrel
and a blackmailer like him?

1190
01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:55.720 line:82%
He can come any time. And who knows,
he might throttle Poonam to death!

1191
01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:58.360 line:82%
What nonsense!
Why would he throttle me to death?

1192
01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.560 line:82%
To know where Sunil and Kiran are.

1193
01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:02.440 line:82%
They've gone away hidden from him.

1194
01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:06.160 line:82%
He must be trying to find out
where his victims have escaped to.

1195
01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:07.080 line:82%
Isn't it, Rahul?

1196
01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.040 line:82%
Yes.

1197
01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:12.320 line:82%
He must be trying his best to find out
where they must've gone.

1198
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.600 line:82%
But I'm convinced that
they must have gone to a place

1199
01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:19.000 line:82%
which is unknown to anyone besides you.

1200
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.720 line:82%
Absolutely right. And we won't tell anyone
where they've gone.

1201
01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.680 line:82%
Sunil has made me take an oath.

1202
01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.120 line:82%
Sunil proved to be smarter
than I had thought.

1203
01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.200 line:82%
I should be leaving now.

1204
01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:33.680 line:82%
Do visit again.

1205
01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:35.920 line:82%
-Sure.
-And convey my regards to Mr. Mehra.

1206
01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.560 line:82%
-Sure.
-All the best. Take care.

1207
01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:44.480 line:82%
He's a nice boy.

1208
01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.160 line:82%
Beware! Don't ever praise another boy
in my presence. Am I dead?

1209
01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:51.240 line:82%
If you had loved me.

1210
01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:52.640 line:82%
I would've been playing cricket
for the Indian team.

1211
01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:54.440 line:82%
-You've started it again.
-What else should I talk about?

1212
01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.600 line:82%
You just talk about cricket.

1213
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:58.520 line:82%
-Don't you scold me like, Lala Amarnath.
-Now that's enough.

1214
01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:03.360 line:82%
Sir, a Mr. Vicky had called five
to six times. He was asking for you.

1215
01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:05.040 line:82%
He said it is urgent.
He has called you home.

1216
01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:06.760 line:82%
-Vicky?
-Yes.

1217
01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:12.520 line:82%
Vicky?

1218
01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:19.640 line:82%
Vicky.

1219
01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:24.800 line:82%
Your condition is very critical.
I will send for an ambulance.

1220
01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.320 line:82%
No.

1221
01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:30.200 line:82%
Vicky, I...

1222
01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.560 line:82%
Pick up that box.

1223
01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.800 line:82%
You had kept it with me
during college days.

1224
01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:46.120 line:82%
It contains letters
which you wrote to Kiran

1225
01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.240 line:82%
but you never posted them.

1226
01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:55.400 line:82%
The college days were such good days.

1227
01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:58.720 line:82%
It was lively, enjoyable.

1228
01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:03.320 line:82%
No fear, no pains, nor any hassles.

1229
01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:07.760 line:82%
Rahul...

1230
01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:15.560 line:82%
Tell everyone that the smoke
that comes out of a narcotic cigarette,

1231
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.120 line:82%
it is not smoke.

1232
01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:24.360 line:82%
It is a swaying snake.

1233
01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:30.080 line:82%
Which has engulfed my body.

1234
01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:38.240 line:82%
But now the venom has spread.

1235
01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:44.320 line:82%
What have I done in life?

1236
01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.120 line:82%
Nothing.

1237
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.280 line:82%
I could do nothing.

1238
01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:53.080 line:82%
Neither could I be a good son,
nor a good brother.

1239
01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.800 line:82%
Neither could I love anybody,
nor could I belong to anyone.

1240
01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:00.720 line:82%
And now, when I...

1241
01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:08.240 line:82%
Vicky.

1242
01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:11.320 line:82%
Vicky.

1243
01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:16.640 line:82%
Do something. Death.

1244
01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:19.560 line:82%
Please do it.

1245
01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.560 line:82%
Strangle me. Release me.

1246
01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:46.640 line:82%
No. Your life will not go in vain.

1247
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:05.760 line:82%
"My Kiran,
for whom I was living till today.

1248
01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.080 line:82%
She married somebody else.
So there is no point in staying alive.

1249
01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:12.920 line:82%
Kiran, I tried to convince you
about my love in every possible way.

1250
01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.040 line:82%
But you didn't agree.
Perhaps my death might convince you.

1251
01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:18.840 line:82%
Yours, and only yours. Vicky."

1252
01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:22.560 line:82%
The scoundrel is dead.

1253
01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:28.800 line:82%
He has hit a four.

1254
01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:37.360 line:82%
-Can I ask you something?
-Go ahead.

1255
01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:41.000 line:82%
Why do you dress up
and watch cricket matches?

1256
01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.320 line:82%
Considering our team's condition
these days,

1257
01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:46.720 line:82%
I feel that they may need me any time.

1258
01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:48.320 line:82%
That's why I 'm always ready.

1259
01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:58.040 line:82%
-Congratulations, Sir.
-What for? It's a matter of shame.

1260
01:59:58.160 --> 01:59:59.920 line:82%
They've scored 102 runs in 40 overs.

1261
02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:02.480 line:82%
If I was in their place,
I would commit suicide.

1262
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:05.920 line:82%
Come on, More, hit.
More is out! They're all out!

1263
02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.080 line:82%
I don't understand the ways of cricket.

1264
02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:10.400 line:82%
I've got news
about someone else's suicide.

1265
02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:12.520 line:82%
Suicide? Who committed suicide?

1266
02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:15.600 line:82%
Last night, your fear committed suicide.

1267
02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:18.080 line:82%
Suicide? You mean a hit wicket?

1268
02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:22.560 line:82%
The boy who used to telephone Kiran
and frighten her, he is dead?

1269
02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:23.680 line:82%
Yes.

1270
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.240 line:82%
Are you convinced that the
person who died is the one?

1271
02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.560 line:82%
We have got evidences.

1272
02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:31.880 line:82%
Kiran's photographs, letters,
telephone number

1273
02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:34.480 line:82%
and the last letter written by him.

1274
02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:39.160 line:82%
He has written that he is committing
suicide since Kiran married Sunil.

1275
02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.840 line:82%
-What was his name?
-Vikram Oberoi.

1276
02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.680 line:82%
Didn't I say that my curse
wouldn't go waste?

1277
02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.840 line:82%
Her curse is like Kapil's ball.
It hit the wicket and he died!

1278
02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.440 line:82%
This is very good news.
Sunil will be glad to hear it.

1279
02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.880 line:82%
Yes. Rahul is right. You had better call
Switzerland right away.

1280
02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:01.000 line:82%
-Okay, in a minute.
-All right then. I'm leaving.

1281
02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:02.040 line:82%
Okay, all the best.

1282
02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:03.440 line:82%
-Bye.
-Bye, Rahul.

1283
02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:05.840 line:82%
Excuse me.

1284
02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:14.760 line:82%
What's the matter?
You're looking at me very attentively.

1285
02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:16.720 line:82%
I've seen you before.

1286
02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:20.640 line:82%
5 feet 10. Hospital!

1287
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.360 line:82%
Absolutely right.
You are Mr. Sunil's friend.

1288
02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:26.160 line:82%
-Yes.
-You're Kiran's friend too?

1289
02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:30.760 line:82%
No. I've never met her.

1290
02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:32.760 line:82%
Do you know Vikram?

1291
02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:39.800 line:82%
All right. You may go.

1292
02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:43.120 line:82%
Lost. The match.

1293
02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.040 line:82%
-I hope you won't forget me now.
-Not at all.

1294
02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:49.000 line:82%
Tell me, what's the phone number of Sunil?

1295
02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.200 line:82%
0 0 4 1

1296
02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.800 line:82%
2 7 2 8 6 0.

1297
02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.280 line:82%
-Is this right?
-Yes.

1298
02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:01.120 line:82%
But move a little this way.

1299
02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.640 line:82%
This is nice.
But move a little further this way.

1300
02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:08.880 line:82%
I should move away further?
All right, how's this?

1301
02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:12.560 line:82%
Now it is looking good.
But a little this way.

1302
02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:16.840 line:82%
-My hair is fine, isn't it?
-You're looking very beautiful.

1303
02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:19.760 line:82%
Move a little away,
and you will look even more beautiful.

1304
02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.120 line:82%
Wow! You're looking very beautiful.

1305
02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.600 line:82%
You were never more beautiful.

1306
02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:34.680 line:82%
Gosh! You're looking so beautiful.

1307
02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.920 line:82%
I never knew that you
looked so beautiful on camera.

1308
02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:39.080 line:82%
Really.

1309
02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:42.080 line:82%
You're looking very beautiful.

1310
02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:45.480 line:82%
-I'm looking beautiful, is it?
-Yes. You're looking beautiful.

1311
02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:48.320 line:82%
-Are you coming closer to me?
-Yes, I'm coming closer.

1312
02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:49.720 line:82%
So you are zooming in on me?

1313
02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.760 line:82%
What do you think about this pose?
Shall I lift my legs?

1314
02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:54.240 line:82%
-Yes. Lift your legs.
-I'll remove the shoes too.

1315
02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.880 line:82%
Yes, remove the shoes.
They don't look good.

1316
02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.600 line:82%
What do you think of this pose?

1317
02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:07.000 line:82%
This pose is also nice.
But move your shoes a bit.

1318
02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:09.760 line:82%
I will kill you.
You were taking my pictures?

1319
02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:12.400 line:82%
You were watching those girls.
And you asked me to move further.

1320
02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:14.560 line:82%
My camera was on them, what can I do?

1321
02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:51.800 line:82%
Don't answer the phone.

1322
02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:55.440 line:82%
Brother! It's brother on the phone.

1323
02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:57.440 line:82%
Your brother has good timing.

1324
02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:00.160 line:82%
You go ahead. I'll join you.

1325
02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:01.680 line:82%
Brother.

1326
02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:04.640 line:82%
There's good news.

1327
02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:07.520 line:82%
The boy who used to harass you
has been out hit-wicket.

1328
02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:09.280 line:82%
-Tell her clearly.
-He has committed suicide.

1329
02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:11.080 line:82%
Hey that's what I am trying to tell her.
He has committed suicide?

1330
02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:12.400 line:82%
He has committed suicide?

1331
02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:16.640 line:82%
-When did all this happen?
-Last night.

1332
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.040 line:82%
But who was he?

1333
02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:22.840 line:82%
Who Vicky? I don't know any...

1334
02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:26.080 line:82%
I see in Simla. That must be the one.

1335
02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:29.880 line:82%
There couldn't have been better news.

1336
02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:32.760 line:82%
Just a minute, I'm speaking here.

1337
02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:36.800 line:82%
-How are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?

1338
02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:40.240 line:82%
Everybody is fine here.
What your brother has said is true.

1339
02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:42.440 line:82%
Don't take any tension. And how is Sunil?

1340
02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:44.400 line:82%
Give him a lot of love.

1341
02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:48.000 line:82%
-And when are you returning?
-We will be back soon.

1342
02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.080 line:82%
I'll convey the good news to Sunil.

1343
02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:55.400 line:82%
The lines disconnected.

1344
02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:57.880 line:82%
I told you to hold it.

1345
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.520 line:82%
You keep on talking rubbish.
You never speak the real thing.

1346
02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.160 line:82%
He's dead!

1347
02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:07.120 line:82%
He's dead!

1348
02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:10.320 line:82%
-Who's dead?
-The one who telephoned.

1349
02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:16.040 line:82%
Yes. Brother just called. He is dead.

1350
02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:20.160 line:82%
-I doubt it.
-About what?

1351
02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:24.560 line:82%
Such a scoundrel, such a rascal,
he harassed so much.

1352
02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:26.600 line:82%
He died so easily?

1353
02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:31.680 line:82%
Don't talk like this. Don't scare me.

1354
02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:42.800 line:82%
Will you eat so much?

1355
02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:45.560 line:82%
You begin.

1356
02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:48.160 line:82%
-Bread?
-No.

1357
02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.400 line:82%
Where is butter?

1358
02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:03.360 line:82%
Who has sent it?

1359
02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:05.680 line:82%
It's addressed to me.

1360
02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:20.680 line:82%
This is the scoundrel
who used to harass us.

1361
02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.200 line:82%
He was sitting behind you
at the Holiday Inn that day.

1362
02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:27.800 line:82%
I know him. He was in my college.

1363
02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:30.320 line:82%
He used to telephone?

1364
02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:34.240 line:82%
But he never spoke to me in college.

1365
02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.880 line:82%
I could never have imagined
that he was so crazy.

1366
02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:41.800 line:82%
He's dead!

1367
02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:44.360 line:82%
He's dead.

1368
02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:46.080 line:82%
It's your fault

1369
02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:47.520 line:82%
Why?

1370
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:50.120 line:82%
You're so beautiful that people go mad.

1371
02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:54.040 line:82%
I fear that there must be others
who must be dreaming about you.

1372
02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.800 line:82%
What would happen
if they start telephoning you?

1373
02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:58.720 line:82%
Here comes the phone.

1374
02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:06.920 line:82%
-Who is it?
-It got disconnected.

1375
02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:11.520 line:82%
Didn't I tell you that some new lover
wants to hear your voice?

1376
02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:16.000 line:82%
You're joking again? You know that
I'm scared of such things.

1377
02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:19.200 line:82%
Let's go sight-seeing.

1378
02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:47.520 line:82%
The distances between us is vanishing

1379
02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:52.320 line:82%
We're being drawn closer to each other

1380
02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:57.840 line:82%
From the skies, I will seek you

1381
02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.440 line:82%
From this world, I shall snatch you away

1382
02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:05.920 line:82%
Say yes

1383
02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:08.560 line:82%
Or say no

1384
02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:14.400 line:82%
Whether you say yes or no
You are mine, Kiran

1385
02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.240 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

1386
02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:21.600 line:82%
Your eyes are sheer magic

1387
02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:27.760 line:82%
Yours is an enchanting scent

1388
02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.280 line:82%
Say yes

1389
02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:33.360 line:82%
Or say no

1390
02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:38.760 line:82%
Whether you say yes or no
You are mine, Kiran

1391
02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:42.040 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

1392
02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.400 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

1393
02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:47.520 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

1394
02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.200 line:82%
Hey, Sunil.

1395
02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.560 line:82%
Close your eyes.

1396
02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:02.280 line:82%
Hold out your hand.

1397
02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:05.240 line:82%
You're tying rakhi?

1398
02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:12.280 line:82%
-Look. How do you find it?
-It's fine.

1399
02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:17.640 line:82%
-But it beats like your heart.
-Now look at its marvel.

1400
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.160 line:82%
Hey! Where is this signal coming from?

1401
02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:27.400 line:82%
I'm giving you the signal.
I've a similar watch with me.

1402
02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:30.400 line:82%
You press the red button.
I will receive the signal.

1403
02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:37.240 line:82%
I understand. You've given me this watch

1404
02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:38.920 line:82%
so that I don't run away from you.

1405
02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:42.280 line:82%
No, I gave it to you
so that when you are alone

1406
02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:44.800 line:82%
and you think of me,
just push this button.

1407
02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.080 line:82%
I will come rushing to you.

1408
02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:14.280 line:82%
Rahul.

1409
02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:18.480 line:82%
I was only joking with you.
And you broke my teeth!

1410
02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:19.480 line:82%
I'm sorry man.

1411
02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:20.400 line:82%
I thought that...

1412
02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:23.080 line:82%
Anyway, how come you are here?

1413
02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:26.400 line:82%
I had come here on Daddy's work.
What're you doing here?

1414
02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:29.560 line:82%
You've come here to celebrate
your honeymoon, haven't you?

1415
02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:33.600 line:82%
You didn't attend the wedding.
Come, I'll introduce you to my wife.

1416
02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:34.520 line:82%
Take it easy.

1417
02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.080 line:82%
This is Rahul, Captain Mehra's son.

1418
02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:44.880 line:82%
Rahul.

1419
02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:47.240 line:82%
Rahul Mehra?

1420
02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:52.440 line:82%
I haven't changed so much
that you don't recognize me.

1421
02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.680 line:82%
Do you'll know each other?

1422
02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:58.320 line:82%
We've studied in the same college.

1423
02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:05.280 line:82%
You haven't changed a bit.
You continue to blush like ever.

1424
02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.520 line:82%
I'm glad that I met you.

1425
02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.800 line:82%
If one meets someone
from your own country,

1426
02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:16.600 line:82%
one begins to feel at home
even in a foreign country.

1427
02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:19.120 line:82%
There's nothing like your own country
or a foreign country.

1428
02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:21.000 line:82%
If one's own people are there
in a foreign country,

1429
02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:22.760 line:82%
it becomes your own country.

1430
02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:25.240 line:82%
Otherwise, even our own country
feels like a foreign country.

1431
02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:29.240 line:82%
-Then why didn't you marry?
-Not everyone is lucky like you are.

1432
02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:33.320 line:82%
That's not the case.
You are hiding the truth.

1433
02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:36.040 line:82%
Do you know what the truth is?

1434
02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:40.720 line:82%
The whole of college knew that Rahul
was crazy about some girl.

1435
02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:45.240 line:82%
But nobody knew who that girl was.
All of us tried a lot.

1436
02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:47.160 line:82%
But the secret was never revealed.

1437
02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:49.120 line:82%
Come on, tell us now.

1438
02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:52.760 line:82%
Even that girl doesn't know.

1439
02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:54.560 line:82%
How can she?

1440
02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:56.240 line:82%
You wouldn't have told her.

1441
02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:00.320 line:82%
Tell us now who she is.

1442
02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:03.080 line:82%
She has got married.

1443
02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:04.600 line:82%
How sad?

1444
02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:06.760 line:82%
It means the story comes to an end.

1445
02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:10.240 line:82%
-The story has yet come to an end.
-What do you mean?

1446
02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.240 line:82%
I'm thinking of killing her husband.

1447
02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:16.680 line:82%
That's like a brave man!

1448
02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:27.160 line:82%
You aren't coming for a swim?

1449
02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:30.560 line:82%
-No, you'll carry on.
-Why? Are you scared of drowning?

1450
02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:32.800 line:82%
No. I'm scared of drowning alone.

1451
02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:03.680 line:82%
You're in front of me
I'm in front of you

1452
02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.920 line:82%
Should I gaze at you, or make love to you?

1453
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.840 line:82%
We're here, face to face with each other

1454
02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:30.240 line:82%
Should I gaze at you,
Or make love to you?

1455
02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:35.080 line:82%
How did this come to be?
You now belong to me

1456
02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:40.160 line:82%
How am I to believe it?

1457
02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:44.920 line:82%
You're in front of me
I'm in front of you

1458
02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:49.400 line:82%
Should I gaze at you, or make love to you?

1459
02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:54.280 line:82%
How did this come to be?
You now belong to me

1460
02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:59.080 line:82%
How am I to believe it?

1461
02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:04.520 line:82%
You're in front of me
I'm in front of you

1462
02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:13.520 line:82%
I'm shattered, I've gone to pieces

1463
02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:18.680 line:82%
It's your persistence
That has been my undoing

1464
02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:23.440 line:82%
I'm shattered, I've gone to pieces

1465
02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:28.520 line:82%
It's your persistence
That has been my undoing

1466
02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:33.640 line:82%
Your spell has worked, O magician

1467
02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:37.840 line:82%
I'm shattered, I've gone to pieces

1468
02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:42.560 line:82%
It's your persistence
That has been my undoing

1469
02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:47.480 line:82%
We're here, face to face with each other

1470
02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:51.720 line:82%
Should I gaze at you
Or make love to you?

1471
02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:56.840 line:82%
How did this come to be?
You now belong to me

1472
02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:02.160 line:82%
How am I to believe my luck?

1473
02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:40.360 line:82%
Your tresses, I will play with

1474
02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:44.800 line:82%
I'll gather you in my arms

1475
02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:49.760 line:82%
Your tresses, I will play with

1476
02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:54.480 line:82%
I'll gather you in my arms

1477
02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:59.000 line:82%
Every lover gives away his heart

1478
02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:04.280 line:82%
But I will lay down my life for you

1479
02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:09.080 line:82%
Take the redness of my lips

1480
02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:13.880 line:82%
Or the wine that flows from my eyes

1481
02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:19.120 line:82%
Take the redness of my lips

1482
02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:23.320 line:82%
Or the wine that flows from my eyes

1483
02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.840 line:82%
Your spell has worked on me, O magician

1484
02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:32.840 line:82%
My arrogance lies shattered

1485
02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:37.600 line:82%
Your insistence makes me helpless

1486
02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:42.280 line:82%
Here we are, face to face with each other

1487
02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:46.520 line:82%
Should I just watch you
Or make love to you?

1488
02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:51.400 line:82%
How did this come to be?
That you now belong to me

1489
02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:57.120 line:82%
How am I to believe my luck?

1490
02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:35.040 line:82%
This story is a hundred years old

1491
02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:39.320 line:82%
Your youth gets better with time

1492
02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:44.120 line:82%
This story is a hundred years old

1493
02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:48.560 line:82%
Your youth gets better with time

1494
02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:53.320 line:82%
A few moments spent in your love

1495
02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:58.680 line:82%
Are like a hundred years of my life

1496
02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:03.320 line:82%
Not once, make love to me a hundred times

1497
02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.320 line:82%
Love me to the fullest

1498
02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:12.800 line:82%
Not once, make love to me a hundred times

1499
02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:17.280 line:82%
Love me to the fullest

1500
02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:22.760 line:82%
Your spell has worked on me, O magician

1501
02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:26.840 line:82%
I am shattered

1502
02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:31.400 line:82%
Against your insistence, I am defenseless

1503
02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:36.200 line:82%
We stand here, face to face

1504
02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:40.480 line:82%
Should I just admire you
Or make love to you?

1505
02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:45.600 line:82%
How did this come to be?
That you now belong to me

1506
02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:50.320 line:82%
How am I to believe my luck?

1507
02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:37.720 line:82%
Look behind.
Two boys are escorting a beauty.

1508
02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:42.680 line:82%
How wonderful. One heroine and two heroes.

1509
02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:50.520 line:82%
-We are all prepared to accompany you.
-Take us along. It'll be fun!

1510
02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:01.400 line:82%
What were you saying?

1511
02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:04.520 line:82%
What were you saying?

1512
02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:14.800 line:82%
Tell me. What were you saying?

1513
02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:21.080 line:82%
-What were you saying? Repeat it again.
-Stop it, Rahul.

1514
02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:22.480 line:82%
What were you saying?

1515
02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:24.320 line:82%
Stop it.

1516
02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:26.600 line:82%
Come on, calm down!

1517
02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:28.760 line:82%
Calm down!

1518
02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:36.520 line:82%
Why get so angry?

1519
02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:39.560 line:82%
You had become mad.
What if that man had died?

1520
02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:45.160 line:82%
In my opinion, people who cross the limit
have no right to live.

1521
02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:47.840 line:82%
But who are we to set the limits?

1522
02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:51.040 line:82%
Every human being is free.
He can do what he likes.

1523
02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:56.000 line:82%
Nobody can misbehave with a girl
in my presence.

1524
02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:58.360 line:82%
Did you never feel angry?

1525
02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.800 line:82%
I did. I used to be so furious that.

1526
02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:06.360 line:82%
I felt like smashing that person to bits.

1527
02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:08.520 line:82%
Stop all this now.

1528
02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:10.920 line:82%
I will get something to cool down tempers.

1529
02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:14.360 line:82%
Be seated. I will get it.

1530
02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:16.400 line:82%
What will you bring?

1531
02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:21.040 line:82%
And bring Coke for me.

1532
02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:28.120 line:82%
The weather is so beautiful today.

1533
02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:30.600 line:82%
Yes.

1534
02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:43.480 line:82%
-I'm Vijay speaking.
-It's you?

1535
02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:45.240 line:82%
-How are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?

1536
02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:46.600 line:82%
-I'm fine.
-How about sister-in-law?

1537
02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:49.000 line:82%
She is fine too.
We had quarreled just this morning.

1538
02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:50.640 line:82%
It means we are still in love.

1539
02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:53.080 line:82%
How is it at your end?

1540
02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:57.720 line:82%
It's great fun since Rahul has come,
we roam about all day long.

1541
02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:01.760 line:82%
Who? Rahul? Who's Rahul?

1542
02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:03.840 line:82%
Captain Mehra's son.

1543
02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:06.880 line:82%
-He reached there too?
-You know Rahul?

1544
02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:09.440 line:82%
Yes. He had come home
several times after you had left.

1545
02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:12.600 line:82%
But he didn't tell me
that he's going to Switzerland.

1546
02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:13.520 line:82%
How strange?

1547
02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:16.440 line:82%
Anyhow, take care.

1548
02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:18.080 line:82%
Okay.

1549
02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:53.320 line:82%
Rahul, you're really crazy.

1550
02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:59.480 line:82%
The men have decided
that we will drink liquor till late.

1551
02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:01.720 line:82%
Ladies can think what they want to do.

1552
02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:06.200 line:82%
The ladies have decided
that they will go to sleep.

1553
02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:08.040 line:82%
The ladies are feeling very tired.

1554
02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:13.320 line:82%
Bye love.

1555
02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:29.360 line:82%
What's the name of that girl
whom you loved during college days?

1556
02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:32.800 line:82%
Didn't I tell you, that she's married?

1557
02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:34.640 line:82%
Why wasn't she married to you?

1558
02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:37.880 line:82%
Only she can answer that question.

1559
02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:39.120 line:82%
Where does she live?

1560
02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:41.920 line:82%
Earlier, she lived in my heart.

1561
02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:46.240 line:82%
I don't know where she is now.

1562
02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:54.040 line:82%
Did she study in the same college
where you and Kiran studied?

1563
02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:55.720 line:82%
Yes.

1564
02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:58.520 line:82%
What's her name?

1565
02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:05.120 line:82%
What name should I tell you?

1566
02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:12.080 line:82%
They ask who Ghalib is.

1567
02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:15.600 line:82%
Somebody should tell me
what I should answer.

1568
02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:18.280 line:82%
What's her name?

1569
02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:21.400 line:82%
If I take her name...

1570
02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:24.840 line:82%
She will be disgraced.

1571
02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:31.840 line:82%
Don't ask me the story of my heart.

1572
02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:36.360 line:82%
These names contain names
of people who hide themselves.

1573
02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:41.640 line:82%
The pain of the heart doesn't get reduced.

1574
02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:44.680 line:82%
if it is concealed in liquor or poetry.
In fact, it increases.

1575
02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:48.560 line:82%
One feels comforted
when the issue is spoken out.

1576
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.480 line:82%
There are some things, Sunil...

1577
02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:54.920 line:82%
which if spoken out,

1578
02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:56.920 line:82%
would be a disaster.

1579
02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:01.600 line:82%
Disaster has to come some day.
Let it come today.

1580
02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:06.680 line:82%
Forget it. Talk about something else.
I want to forget her.

1581
02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:10.840 line:82%
I'm suspicious about you.

1582
02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:13.840 line:82%
Suspicious?

1583
02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:18.680 line:82%
Looks like you're hiding
because perhaps I know that girl.

1584
02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:25.120 line:82%
You're a very dangerous person.

1585
02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:28.040 line:82%
Why did you join the navy?

1586
02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:30.760 line:82%
You should have been in the CBI?

1587
02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:33.320 line:82%
You corner a person in such a way,

1588
02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:36.840 line:82%
that if there were somebody else,
he would've revealed everything.

1589
02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:41.040 line:82%
That's what I want.
That you reveal everything.

1590
02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:43.880 line:82%
There shouldn't be any burden
on your soul.

1591
02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:48.040 line:82%
Burden?

1592
02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:51.800 line:82%
Her memory is not a burden.

1593
02:30:53.640 --> 02:30:54.920 line:82%
Her memory is a treasure.

1594
02:30:56.640 --> 02:31:02.360 line:82%
Something very beautiful,
pleasant and precious.

1595
02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:07.440 line:82%
It's there with me.
And it will go with me.

1596
02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:13.160 line:82%
How can I make you a part
of this possession?

1597
02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:20.000 line:82%
I can't even share it with the person
to whom this possession belongs.

1598
02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:23.440 line:82%
The punishment for the heart beat,

1599
02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:28.080 line:82%
stretches for a long distance.

1600
02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:31.680 line:82%
I'm also leaving.

1601
02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:36.200 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Yes.

1602
02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:39.720 line:82%
Your hotel is very far.
Spend the night here itself.

1603
02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:45.040 line:82%
All right. It makes no difference to me.

1604
02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:47.760 line:82%
I just have to spend the night.

1605
02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:54.600 line:82%
Everybody has heard the melody
which comes out of the instrument.

1606
02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:02.080 line:82%
Which heart knows what has passed
through the breath?

1607
02:32:09.240 --> 02:32:13.440 line:82%
Everybody has heard the melody
which comes out of the instrument.

1608
02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:16.320 line:82%
Which heart knows...

1609
02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:36.000 line:82%
Thank you.

1610
02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:45.080 line:82%
Hey!

1611
02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:50.800 line:82%
Take care.

1612
02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:55.640 line:82%
Do you know each other?

1613
02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:58.280 line:82%
We've studied in the same college.

1614
02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:01.840 line:82%
-Stop it, Rahul.
-What did you say?

1615
02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:05.640 line:82%
I'm thinking of killing her husband.

1616
02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:15.800 line:82%
-Kiran.
-Yes.

1617
02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:16.720 line:82%
Kiran.

1618
02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:22.200 line:82%
Don't feel scared.
And don't ask any questions.

1619
02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:25.800 line:82%
Get ready quietly and reach the boat.

1620
02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:27.720 line:82%
I'll meet you there.

1621
02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:42.640 line:82%
-What happened?
-Nobody is answering.

1622
02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:44.320 line:82%
Where could they have gone
so early in the morning?

1623
02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:45.800 line:82%
I'm feeling worried.

1624
02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:29.280 line:82%
You played this tune, didn't you?

1625
02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:33.720 line:82%
Didn't you play this tune?

1626
02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:36.400 line:82%
Yes.

1627
02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:44.480 line:82%
You telephoned my Kiran?

1628
02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:48.840 line:82%
Yes.

1629
02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:00.440 line:82%
You had tampered
with the brakes of my car.

1630
02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:05.040 line:82%
It was you who made the elevator crash.

1631
02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:06.480 line:82%
Yes.

1632
02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:19.720 line:82%
You've made my Kiran weep a lot.

1633
02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:26.120 line:82%
You've made my Kiran suffer so much.

1634
02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:31.560 line:82%
You've made her weep a lot.

1635
02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:33.720 line:82%
You've made her weep a lot.

1636
02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:50.200 line:82%
That's enough.

1637
02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:53.920 line:82%
Don't hit me anymore.

1638
02:37:57.160 --> 02:37:59.360 line:82%
I know that I'm a bad man.

1639
02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:03.800 line:82%
I've harassed you and your innocent wife.

1640
02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:07.560 line:82%
I have harassed her a lot.
Please forgive me.

1641
02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:12.760 line:82%
But what could I do? I was helpless.

1642
02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:16.480 line:82%
You're a very nice man.

1643
02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:21.720 line:82%
How can you kill someone
who is already dead?

1644
02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:24.800 line:82%
I've received several wounds.

1645
02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:30.400 line:82%
Forgive me. Pardon me, Sunil.

1646
02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:32.040 line:82%
Please forgive me.

1647
02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:53.440 line:82%
Please pardon me.

1648
02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:00.560 line:82%
Your biggest problem is
that you're a nice human being.

1649
02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:03.000 line:82%
Oh, no.

1650
02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:05.480 line:82%
No.

1651
02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:12.680 line:82%
Nobody can come between Kiran and me.

1652
02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:16.560 line:82%
You will remember, won't you?

1653
02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:21.560 line:82%
The manly thing!

1654
02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:24.680 line:82%
The husband is...

1655
02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:28.840 line:82%
Sunil.

1656
02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:40.680 line:82%
Kiran!

1657
02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:48.680 line:82%
Sunil?

1658
02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:50.320 line:82%
Sunil?

1659
02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:04.360 line:82%
You, here?

1660
02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:06.440 line:82%
How did you get wounded?

1661
02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:10.240 line:82%
The wounds are very old.

1662
02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:15.600 line:82%
Earlier, they were on the heart.
Now they have come out into the open.

1663
02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:19.400 line:82%
Where's Sunil?

1664
02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.440 line:82%
-He cannot come now.
-Why can't he come?

1665
02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:28.760 line:82%
He is dead.

1666
02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:31.240 line:82%
What nonsense? Have you gone mad?

1667
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.000 line:82%
I'm mad since years.

1668
02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:39.280 line:82%
You're my madness.

1669
02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:42.120 line:82%
You're my obsession.

1670
02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:53.920 line:82%
No!

1671
02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:55.400 line:82%
Kiran?

1672
02:40:56.480 --> 02:40:57.320 line:82%
Kiran?

1673
02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:08.920 line:82%
Kiran.

1674
02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:14.120 line:82%
No!

1675
02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:19.040 line:82%
You're looking so beautiful.

1676
02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:26.400 line:82%
Just like you were
on the first day to college.

1677
02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:28.440 line:82%
A little scared.

1678
02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:30.240 line:82%
A little coy.

1679
02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:34.280 line:82%
You were wearing the yellow salwar-kameez.

1680
02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:36.280 line:82%
Books in one hand,

1681
02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:39.600 line:82%
and silver bangles on your other arm.

1682
02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:50.320 line:82%
You looked just like this.

1683
02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:54.520 line:82%
The hair curled just like this.

1684
02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:59.200 line:82%
Don't be scared of me.
Don't run away from me.

1685
02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:04.120 line:82%
I've come to tell you
that you're no longer in danger.

1686
02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:09.200 line:82%
You're free. Absolutely free.

1687
02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:16.640 line:82%
The one who misled you, troubled you,
the one who held you captive.

1688
02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:20.400 line:82%
-He's dead.
-No! No!

1689
02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:24.360 line:82%
Sunil cannot die.
You're lying, Sunil cannot die.

1690
02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:25.720 line:82%
-You're lying.
-Shut up!

1691
02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:27.480 line:82%
I've killed him!

1692
02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:30.040 line:82%
No. You've killed him.

1693
02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:33.320 line:82%
Do you know how many have died
because of you?

1694
02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:37.120 line:82%
First those policemen,
then my friend Vicky, and now Sunil.

1695
02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:43.680 line:82%
He was a very nice human being.

1696
02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:48.080 line:82%
Look, don't be insistent.

1697
02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:49.840 line:82%
Kiran.

1698
02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:53.120 line:82%
If you don't want more people to die,

1699
02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:55.400 line:82%
then do as I say.

1700
02:42:57.640 --> 02:42:58.480 line:82%
But Sunil?

1701
02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:02.640 line:82%
Sunil is dead. I've killed him.

1702
02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:12.880 line:82%
Please pardon me.

1703
02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:17.240 line:82%
Don't weep, don't weep.

1704
02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:20.120 line:82%
I cannot see your tears.

1705
02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:25.360 line:82%
Don't weep.

1706
02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:28.200 line:82%
I beg of you.

1707
02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:30.640 line:82%
Please leave me.

1708
02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:32.240 line:82%
Kiran.

1709
02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.360 line:82%
I'm prepared to offer you
anything else but this.

1710
02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:37.720 line:82%
I can even offer you my life.

1711
02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:40.440 line:82%
But don't say this.

1712
02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:43.680 line:82%
I've done so many things to possess you.

1713
02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:46.320 line:82%
I've changed even the lines of destiny.

1714
02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:48.440 line:82%
I'm made the impossible possible.

1715
02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:51.720 line:82%
I've done so much for you. And you...

1716
02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:54.880 line:82%
Why don't you understand?

1717
02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:57.880 line:82%
Why don't you understand?

1718
02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:02.200 line:82%
Come on, get up.

1719
02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.520 line:82%
Hurry up, Kiran. It is too late.

1720
02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:08.280 line:82%
Now get ready quickly.

1721
02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:12.120 line:82%
Wear this saree.

1722
02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:15.480 line:82%
It is my mother's saree.

1723
02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:18.400 line:82%
She wore it on her wedding.

1724
02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:22.480 line:82%
Now her daughter-in-law will wear it.

1725
02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:24.680 line:82%
Take it.

1726
02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:26.120 line:82%
Hold it!

1727
02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:27.400 line:82%
Come on.

1728
02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:29.520 line:82%
Come on.

1729
02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:32.600 line:82%
Be careful.

1730
02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:37.000 line:82%
You...you will look very beautiful
in this.

1731
02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:38.760 line:82%
Go on.

1732
02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:02.040 line:82%
Mother, how are you?

1733
02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:04.040 line:82%
I had promised you

1734
02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:06.880 line:82%
that I'll make Kiran your daughter-in-law.

1735
02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:09.880 line:82%
I'm fulfilling my promise today.

1736
02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:13.880 line:82%
We're coming to you after the marriage.

1737
02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:18.280 line:82%
To seek your blessings.

1738
02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:15.240 line:82%
Open the door.

1739
02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:16.680 line:82%
Kiran.

1740
02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:18.600 line:82%
Open the door.

1741
02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:23.600 line:82%
Open the door.

1742
02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:25.760 line:82%
Kiran, open the door.

1743
02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:39.360 line:82%
Why did she shut the door?

1744
02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:45.560 line:82%
What's the meaning of taking away the key?

1745
02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:48.080 line:82%
She must be feeling shy.

1746
02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:03.120 line:82%
Kiran!

1747
02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:08.800 line:82%
She must be scared of me.

1748
02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:11.600 line:82%
She doesn't realize how much I love her.

1749
02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:14.480 line:82%
How silly of her.

1750
02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.840 line:82%
She will come.

1751
02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:19.040 line:82%
Kiran...

1752
02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:22.600 line:82%
You are my Kiran.

1753
02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:27.360 line:82%
Kiran! Come on!

1754
02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:30.680 line:82%
You are my Kiran.

1755
02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:33.320 line:82%
You are my Kiran.

1756
02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:10.120 line:82%
Come out!

1757
02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:12.520 line:82%
Come out!

1758
02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:14.440 line:82%
Come out!

1759
02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:18.120 line:82%
Come out!

1760
02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:22.600 line:82%
Come out! Kiran!

1761
02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:25.600 line:82%
Kiran! Come out!

1762
02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:29.320 line:82%
Come out. The auspicious time
for marriage is passing away.

1763
02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:37.600 line:82%
No!

1764
02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:40.560 line:82%
-Come on.
-Leave me.

1765
02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:42.800 line:82%
Rahul, please.

1766
02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:50.880 line:82%
No! Don't!

1767
02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:54.160 line:82%
Try to understand.
This marriage is not possible.

1768
02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:01.560 line:82%
Never say that this marriage
is not possible.

1769
02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:04.840 line:82%
This marriage will surely take place.

1770
02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:08.480 line:82%
That's the destiny.

1771
02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:11.760 line:82%
I've written this destiny.

1772
02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:15.520 line:82%
That you will be married to me.

1773
02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:19.800 line:82%
But what's the hurry?

1774
02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:24.880 line:82%
We can get married
when we get back to India.

1775
02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:31.160 line:82%
Your family members will be there.
My family members will be there too.

1776
02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:35.280 line:82%
There will be lot of fanfare.
You'll bring the marriage procession.

1777
02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:38.080 line:82%
-There will be rituals.
-No!

1778
02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:40.040 line:82%
The marriage will take place now, here.

1779
02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:42.520 line:82%
-Right now.
-All right.

1780
02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:48.160 line:82%
As you wish, but let the storm calm down.

1781
02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:51.160 line:82%
We will get married thereafter.

1782
02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.920 line:82%
Let this storm see
how lovers like us are united.

1783
02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:03.280 line:82%
Such weather, such a time, such a place.

1784
02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:08.080 line:82%
Nobody would have got married in this way.

1785
02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:13.160 line:82%
Get ready quickly.

1786
02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:15.680 line:82%
My mother cannot wait long.

1787
02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:18.480 line:82%
Mother? Mother.

1788
02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:21.400 line:82%
Mother. Mother.

1789
02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:25.920 line:82%
Mother! We are coming!

1790
02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:29.320 line:82%
Come on, Kiran. Wear the saree quickly.

1791
02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:32.320 line:82%
-No.
-Come on.

1792
02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:44.840 line:82%
Don't come forward.

1793
02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:49.360 line:82%
Don't come forward, beware.

1794
02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:04.680 line:82%
Don't come forward!

1795
02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:07.320 line:82%
No! No!

1796
02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:15.920 line:82%
No!

1797
02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:18.120 line:82%
No!

1798
02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:12.400 line:82%
Kill him! Kill him!

1799
02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:17.680 line:82%
My life began with your love.

1800
02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:22.200 line:82%
And ended with your love.

1801
02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:25.240 line:82%
I know...

1802
02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:29.280 line:82%
that I've done wrong to you.

1803
02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:32.600 line:82%
But...

1804
02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:38.400 line:82%
But don't hate me.

1805
02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:00.840 line:82%
Your eyes are sheer magic

1806
02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:06.320 line:82%
Your scent is enchanting

1807
02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:12.120 line:82%
Acquiesce or turn me down

1808
02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:17.520 line:82%
Acquiesce or turn me down
You do belong to me, Kiran

1809
02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:21.400 line:82%
You are mine, Kiran

1810
02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:26.240 line:82%
-Hi.
-Come.

1811
02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:28.360 line:82%
-Hello, Brother.
-How are both of you?

1812
02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:30.000 line:82%
Sister-in-law.

1813
02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:33.280 line:82%
-Now I'm feeling scared.
-Why? What happened?

1814
02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:35.920 line:82%
When Vicky died, we were happy.
But then came Rahul.

1815
02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:38.000 line:82%
Now we're happy following Rahul's death.
But what if we receive

1816
02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:40.080 line:82%
-a phone call at home?
-Whose phone?

1817
02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:42.640 line:82%
I love you... Kiran!
