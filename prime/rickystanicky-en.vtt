I mean, he'll probably
be relieved

213
00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:09.375 line:83%
that he doesn't have to
go to a baby shower.

315
00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:59.166 line:83%
-What kind of show?
-Ah. Check this out.

316
00:13:00.875 --> 00:13:01.875 line:83%
Boom!

317
00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:03.666 line:83%
Oh, shit! Yo!

318
00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:05.083 line:83%
"Rock Hard Rod -

319
00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:08.333 line:83%
"South Jersey's premier X-rated
rock'n'roll impersonator".

320
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.625 line:83%
That's not as crazy
as it sounds.

321
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:14.250 line:83%
I mean, most of the songs
are just about masturbation,

322
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.583 line:83%
and we all do that, right?

323
00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:17.333 line:83%
[chuckling] Yeah!

324
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.750 line:83%
Actually, Rod, I don't think
we'll be able to make the show,

325
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.916 line:83%
but we'll buy you a drink

326
00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:22.333 line:83%
if you put
your jerk-off hand down.

327
00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:23.958 line:83%
You drive a hard bargain, sir.

328
00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.500 line:83%
So, you do a bunch of jerk-off
songs to make a living?

329
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.833 line:83%
[Rod] Yeah, I do a whole act.

330
00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:30.916 line:83%
Wall-to-wall,
top-to-bottom jizz jams!

331
00:13:30.916 --> 00:13:33.000 line:83%
You'll be surprised at how much
material lends itself to it.

332
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.250 line:83%
I mean, 'Beat It',
Michael Jackson.

333
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.875 line:83%
'Wind Beneath My Wings',
Bette Midler.

334
00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:37.583 line:83%
-Anything by The Strokes!
-Mm.

335
00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.041 line:83%
Yeah, and I'm the only one
in the world

336
00:13:39.041 --> 00:13:40.083 line:83%
that's figured it out.

337
00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:43.250 line:83%
Yeah, it's almost
hard to believe.

338
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.833 line:83%
Oh, Barry,
my dear friends here

339
00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:46.291 line:83%
will buy me that drink
after all.

340
00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:48.000 line:83%
Oh, yeah,
I also do impressions.

341
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.083 line:83%
You name it, I can do it.
I'm a trained actor, you know.

342
00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:52.000 line:83%
-I got a good one for you, Rod.
-Yeah?

343
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000 line:83%
Why don't you do the guy
that gets the fuck out of here

344
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.583 line:83%
before I call security?

345
00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:57.416 line:83%
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay.

346
00:13:57.416 --> 00:13:58.541 line:83%
I think we'd like to see this.

347
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:00.125 line:83%
And go ahead
and bring him that drink.

348
00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:03.458 line:83%
Ha!
And the calamari, Bar-ry!

349
00:14:03.458 --> 00:14:05.625 line:83%
[chuckling] Dickhead!
Love that guy.

350
00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:07.333 line:83%
So, who do you guys
want me to do?

351
00:14:07.333 --> 00:14:09.916 line:83%
You, er, I don't know,
you like Owen Wilson?

352
00:14:10.458 --> 00:14:11.958 line:83%
-Sure.
-We love Owen Wilson.

353
00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.250 line:83%
-Yeah, that's fine.
-I would love some Owen Wilson.

354
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.041 line:83%
[mimics Owen Wilson's voice]
Wow!

355
00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:20.916 line:83%
Where in the history
of our relationship

356
00:14:20.916 --> 00:14:22.958 line:83%
did you think
I couldn't do an impersonation

357
00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.000 line:83%
of somebody as adorable
as The Big O?

358
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.833 line:83%
That is an excellent Owen
Wilson. That's a good Owen.

359
00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:28.958 line:83%
-It's okay.
-Wow.

360
00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.916 line:83%
-[JT] It's not that good.
-Thank you. Oh, er...

361
00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:33.083 line:83%
-I'm just...
-[Wes] Calamari's here, man.

362
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.666 line:83%
[slurps noisily]

363
00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:38.458 line:83%
All right,
an oldie but a goodie.

364
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.375 line:83%
[smoky woman's voice]
Take a look at this tit, kid.

365
00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:44.166 line:83%
Probably the last one
you're ever going to see

366
00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:45.416 line:83%
for the rest of your life.

367
00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:47.750 line:83%
[little boy's voice]
Don't drink no more, Momma.

368
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.250 line:83%
You're real mean
when you drink stuff.

369
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.500 line:83%
[woman's voice] Quit your
bitchin', ya sloppy punk.

370
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.166 line:83%
You wanna know how
you was hatched?

371
00:14:53.166 --> 00:14:55.875 line:83%
Your old man
was basting my rump roast

372
00:14:55.875 --> 00:14:57.958 line:83%
and some of it dribbled
into my woolly burger.

373
00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.750 line:83%
You know what
that makes you?

374
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.750 line:83%
[laughs] A shit baby!

375
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.750 line:83%
That's right,
you're nothing but shit,

376
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.416 line:83%
and you always will be!

377
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.458 line:83%
Is... is that from
'Downton Abbey'?

378
00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:11.833 line:83%
That was, er...

379
00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:14.375 line:83%
just a little skit
from my childhood.

380
00:15:19.625 --> 00:15:20.666 line:83%
[Dean] Er, yeah...

381
00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:22.833 line:83%
I think it's time
to hit the tables, boys. Huh?

382
00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.791 line:83%
Right on. Where are we going?

383
00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:26.416 line:83%
Copper Bonnet's the only place
on the boardwalk

384
00:15:26.416 --> 00:15:27.416 line:83%
with 50-cent tables.

385
00:15:27.416 --> 00:15:29.291 line:83%
Not as many hookers,
but they're friendlier -

386
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:30.416 line:83%
they don't get weirded out

387
00:15:30.416 --> 00:15:31.833 line:83%
when you just wanna
brush their hair.

388
00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:34.041 line:83%
Yeah, Rod, I think we're just
going to stay around here.

389
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:36.541 line:83%
Oh, here's great. I'm friends
with the bartender, Barry.

390
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.333 line:83%
Hey, Hard-on Ronnie,
we are doing our own thing.

391
00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:43.125 line:83%
We got our thing going on,

392
00:15:43.125 --> 00:15:46.166 line:83%
and we're probably
just gonna...

393
00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:47.958 line:83%
leave you.

394
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.375 line:83%
Okay, I can take a hint.

395
00:15:55.375 --> 00:15:56.375 line:83%
You guys look at me

396
00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:58.333 line:83%
and you just see another
scumbag impersonator, right?

397
00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:01.083 line:83%
Thanks for understanding, man.
You're a good dude.

398
00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:07.791 line:83%
-What the hell, man?
-What?

399
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:09.666 line:83%
You didn't have to be
so mean about it.

400
00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:12.333 line:83%
What? I wasn't...
What did I do?

401
00:16:13.208 --> 00:16:14.708 line:83%
What? Was I being an asshole?

402
00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.791 line:83%
Well, you called him
'Hard-on Ronnie'.

403
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:18.666 line:83%
It's 'Rock Hard Rod'.

404
00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:20.625 line:83%
Ohh, right, I'm so sorry.

405
00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:22.166 line:83%
I didn't know
Weird Al Wankovic

406
00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:23.833 line:83%
would be so sensitive.

407
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.083 line:83%
Rod! Hey, Rod!

408
00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:28.916 line:83%
These are mine.

409
00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:31.583 line:83%
I just wanted to say sorry for
what happened back there.

410
00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:33.000 line:83%
My friends...

411
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.500 line:83%
they just want it to be
some kind of reunion, just us,

412
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.125 line:83%
but that wasn't cool, so...

413
00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:40.750 line:83%
Whatever, I get it.
Happens all the time.

414
00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:43.458 line:83%
You guys come in to AC

415
00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:46.125 line:83%
with your Toyota Avalons and
your anesthesiologist money.

416
00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:48.000 line:83%
Strutting around
like a bunch of big shots.

417
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.416 line:83%
Let me tell you something.

418
00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:50.916 line:83%
We lost Joan Rivers
and Michael Jackson

419
00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:52.291 line:83%
because of you fuckers, okay?

420
00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:54.500 line:83%
None of us are
anesthesiologists.

421
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.000 line:83%
Not here for the convention?

422
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.208 line:83%
No.

423
00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:01.500 line:83%
Hey, I get it, man.

424
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.041 line:83%
You look at me and see another
asshole sideshow freak, right?

425
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:05.708 line:83%
-Not at all.
-I'm more than that.

426
00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:07.666 line:83%
I'm a damn good actor.

427
00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:09.708 line:83%
You'll see.

428
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.500 line:83%
Shit!

429
00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:20.083 line:83%
Who are they?

430
00:17:20.083 --> 00:17:21.708 line:83%
Crazy fans
I was trying to avoid.

431
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.208 line:83%
Anyway, I gotta run.
Hey, take my card.

432
00:17:27.083 --> 00:17:28.166 line:83%
Remember that name.

433
00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:30.125 line:83%
I promise it's going to mean
something to you some day.

434
00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:32.041 line:83%
I would not be surprised.

435
00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.291 line:83%
[slurps noisily]

436
00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:43.875 line:83%
Oh! Jeez.

437

[cell phone pinging]

438
00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:02.916 line:83%
Oh, my God! Yes! Yes!

439
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.166 line:83%
[JT laughs]

440
00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:05.958 line:83%
-Give me my money right now!
-JT! JT!

441
00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.208 line:83%
Not now, Dean. I'm on fire!

442
00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:10.416 line:83%
And for once I'm going to leave
Atlantic City a winner!

443
00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:12.000 line:83%
Susan's in labor.

444
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.291 line:83%
[dramatic music]

445
00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:18.500 line:83%
This was a bad idea.
I knew this was a bad idea.

446
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.708 line:83%
Don't friggin' do that, man.

447
00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:21.750 line:83%
You're 'Monday morning
quarterbacking' right now.

448
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.833 line:83%
Who could've figured she'd go
into labor six weeks early?

449
00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:27.125 line:83%
Six weeks! My baby's going to
be born six weeks early.

450
00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:29.291 line:83%
-Is he going to be okay?
-The baby's going to fine.

451
00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:31.500 line:83%
Babies are born
six weeks early all the time.

452
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.208 line:83%
I was born six weeks early.

453
00:18:33.208 --> 00:18:35.250 line:83%
Oh, shit! Go, go, go! Go!

454
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.708 line:83%
Susan Levine.
What room is she in?

455
00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:49.416 line:83%
-Levine?
-Yeah, Levine.

456
00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:53.083 line:83%
Ah, here we are.
She and the baby are in 208.

457
00:18:54.125 --> 00:18:55.708 line:83%
She had the baby?!

458
00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:57.541 line:83%
[JT] Oh, baby Whitaker.

459
00:18:58.041 --> 00:18:59.916 line:83%
This was not the birth plan
I had for you.

460
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:02.625 line:83%
I wanted you born on the shores
of Goosewing Beach.

461
00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:04.333 line:83%
You know what
my birth plan was?

462
00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:06.291 line:83%
For you to actually be here.

463
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:08.208 line:83%
Why isn't he wearing a shirt?

464
00:19:08.208 --> 00:19:10.666 line:83%
I'm having skin-to-skin
contact with my son, Leona.

465
00:19:10.666 --> 00:19:13.125 line:83%
It's a proven way of regulating
a newborn baby's temperature,

466
00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:14.625 line:83%
and it calms him, thank you.

467
00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.166 line:83%
Don't blankets do that?

468
00:19:16.666 --> 00:19:19.500 line:83%
Oh, he is such a little peanut.

469
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.083 line:83%
We should call him Shrimpy,
he's such a little peanut.

470
00:19:22.083 --> 00:19:25.083 line:83%
Please don't call
my grandson 'Shrimpy'.

471
00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:27.333 line:83%
Shrimps are
the cockroaches of the sea.

472
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:30.583 line:83%
6lbs is pretty good for a month
and a half early, right, Mom?

473
00:19:30.583 --> 00:19:32.708 line:83%
Oh, he's perfect. He's perfect.

474
00:19:32.708 --> 00:19:35.458 line:83%
I want to know where the hell
you guys were tonight.

475
00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:37.625 line:83%
We called every hospital
in Albany

476
00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:40.208 line:83%
and there was no record
of a Ricky Stanicky.

477
00:19:40.208 --> 00:19:41.833 line:83%
Yeah, and the last thing
you tell me

478
00:19:41.833 --> 00:19:44.166 line:83%
is you got to go see him
because he's got...

479
00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:45.625 line:83%
What kind of cancer?

480
00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:48.416 line:83%
Er... anal.

481
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.625 line:83%
I thought it was testicular.

482
00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:54.166 line:83%
It was testicular, but then
it spread to his anus.

483
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.916 line:83%
Yeah, they had to remove it.

484
00:19:56.916 --> 00:19:58.208 line:83%
They removed his asshole?

485
00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:02.458 line:83%
Er... just the outer lip part.

486
00:20:02.458 --> 00:20:05.291 line:83%
Outer lip part?
What is he, a fucking baboon?

487
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:07.375 line:83%
Come on, Wes.
What's going on here?

488
00:20:07.375 --> 00:20:08.958 line:83%
Where were you?

489
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.500 line:83%
Okay.

490
00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:17.833 line:83%
It was a lie.

491
00:20:19.125 --> 00:20:21.041 line:83%
It's all been a lie.

492
00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:23.208 line:83%
What's a lie?

493
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.208 line:83%
The whole Ricky Stanicky thing.

494
00:20:27.083 --> 00:20:29.333 line:83%
It was, uh...

495
00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:30.500 line:83%
It's bullshit.

496
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.500 line:83%
JT, what's he talking about?

497
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.208 line:83%
Yeah, Dean,
what is he talking about?

498
00:20:35.833 --> 00:20:37.791 line:83%
He's saying...

499
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:40.291 line:83%
Ricky Stanicky lied to us.

500
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:42.708 line:83%
Okay? There was no cancer.

501
00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:45.000 line:83%
When we got to the hospital,
Ricky was standing out front

502
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.708 line:83%
with a bottle of champagne
and a limo.

503
00:20:46.708 --> 00:20:48.750 line:83%
Turns out that it was his
five-year anniversary

504
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.541 line:83%
being cancer free.

505
00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:53.625 line:83%
So he pretended to have cancer

506
00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:56.375 line:83%
just so he could celebrate
not having cancer?

507
00:20:56.375 --> 00:20:58.291 line:83%
I... Yeah.

508
00:20:58.291 --> 00:20:59.416 line:83%
It's typical Rick.

509
00:20:59.416 --> 00:21:01.375 line:83%
You know, he's got
such a weird sense of humour.

510
00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:02.958 line:83%
-[Dean] He does, yep.
-[Erin] Okay...

511
00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:05.500 line:83%
He was in Albany meeting with
the Give Green Foundation,

512
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.708 line:83%
and I guess he just wanted
to celebrate with us.

513
00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:09.208 line:83%
So he pranked us.

514
00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:11.791 line:83%
The Give Green Foundation?

515
00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:14.416 line:83%
Yeah. You've heard of them,
Leona. They're wonderful.

516
00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:18.000 line:83%
Wait, why didn't you call us
and tell us that he was okay?

517
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.791 line:83%
And why was your phone off
all night?

518
00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:21.333 line:83%
Oh, baby, it was a whirlwind.

519
00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:22.916 line:83%
Ricky took us
to a stand-up comedy show

520
00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:24.583 line:83%
and they didn't
allow cell phones, so...

521
00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:27.208 line:83%
And after that,
the night turned into a blur.

522
00:21:27.208 --> 00:21:29.458 line:83%
You know I wanted
to be here for you for this.

523
00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:31.000 line:83%
I wanted this more
than you did.

524
00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.208 line:83%
Oh, get that baby
off that thing

525
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.333 line:83%
and give him to his mother.

526
00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:35.916 line:83%
Oh, that is disgusting!

527
00:21:35.916 --> 00:21:39.208 line:83%
No. It's dangerous to detach.
Let him suck it out.

528
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.250 line:83%
[whispers] Yeah. Good boy.

529
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.000 line:83%
This hippie-dippy crap.

530
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000 line:83%
Well, I'm certainly
going to give Ricky an earful

531
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.083 line:83%
when I see him
at the bris next week.

532
00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:49.416 line:83%
What's a bris?

533
00:21:49.416 --> 00:21:51.041 line:83%
It's the circumcision ceremony.

534
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:54.041 line:83%
Oh! It sounds like a soup.

535
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:56.458 line:83%
You know, I doubt he's going to
be able to be there, sadly.

536
00:21:56.458 --> 00:21:57.541 line:83%
Why not?

537
00:21:58.375 --> 00:22:00.125 line:83%
He has work in Nairobi.

538
00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:01.458 line:83%
No, he doesn't.

539
00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:03.208 line:83%
Wes is helping him out
with some fundraiser

540
00:22:03.208 --> 00:22:04.750 line:83%
in Providence
on Saturday night.

541
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.333 line:83%
[Wes clearing throat]

542
00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:08.625 line:83%
I remember telling...
[voice breaks] I told you.

543
00:22:09.708 --> 00:22:10.833 line:83%
Yeah.

544
00:22:10.833 --> 00:22:14.833 line:83%
Great. Well, the bris is on
Sunday, so he can make it.

545
00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:18.166 line:83%
Yeah, maybe. Unless he's got to
fly out early on Sunday.

546
00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:19.375 line:83%
Well, that's ridiculous.

547
00:22:19.375 --> 00:22:20.916 line:83%
Come on,
if he's in town on Saturday,

548
00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:23.208 line:83%
why wouldn't he spend an extra
day to meet baby Whitaker?

549
00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:25.333 line:83%
Yeah, why wouldn't he?

550
00:22:26.208 --> 00:22:29.458 line:83%
You're absolutely right.
He should stay an extra day.

551
00:22:29.458 --> 00:22:31.416 line:83%
In fact, I'm going to
make sure of it.

552
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:33.416 line:83%
[JT] What the fuck, Dean?

553
00:22:33.416 --> 00:22:34.875 line:83%
What did you want me
to say, man?

554
00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:36.250 line:83%
They were all staring at me.

555
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.916 line:83%
I look at you. You've got baby
Whitaker nursing on you.

556
00:22:38.916 --> 00:22:40.416 line:83%
Horrible name, by the way.

557
00:22:40.416 --> 00:22:42.250 line:83%
-I just--
-You panicked.

558
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.500 line:83%
I panicked?!

559
00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:46.500 line:83%
What are you talk...?! You're
the one who almost outed us!

560
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.833 line:83%
And you made plans
with Stanicky!

561
00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.041 line:83%
Ricky Stanicky is not
a one-man show. You know that!

562
00:22:50.041 --> 00:22:51.541 line:83%
It's a fragile fabric, man.

563
00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:54.125 line:83%
Ricky Stanicky is only to be
used as a three-man team.

564
00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:55.125 line:83%
Huh.

565
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.791 line:83%
So, what about
the golf rounds with Ricky

566
00:22:56.791 --> 00:22:58.250 line:83%
that JT charged
to your company?

567
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.458 line:83%
-You weren't there.
-What?

568
00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:01.000 line:83%
I charged the rounds of golf

569
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.583 line:83%
because you didn't
have any money.

570
00:23:02.583 --> 00:23:05.625 line:83%
Seriously, Wes. What
happened in there, man?

571
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.791 line:83%
Look.

572
00:23:07.791 --> 00:23:10.250 line:83%
Keith's been on my ass
about finding a job,

573
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.500 line:83%
and sleeping all day...

574
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.750 line:83%
and pumicing my foot-skin
over the sink.

575
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.833 line:83%
What the fuck does this
have to do with Stanicky?

576
00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:18.666 line:83%
I needed a break!

577
00:23:18.666 --> 00:23:20.500 line:83%
Keith can be very oppressive.

578
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.125 line:83%
Sometimes
I feel like I'm living

579
00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:23.541 line:83%
in a gay 'Handmaid's Tale'.

580
00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:29.166 line:83%
So I went to a pot farm, where
they make cannabis milk.

581
00:23:29.166 --> 00:23:31.166 line:83%
You played the Stanicky card
to get pot milk?

582
00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:33.083 line:83%
You never had milk
like this before.

583
00:23:33.083 --> 00:23:34.458 line:83%
-No, I haven't.
-It's delicious.

584
00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:35.541 line:83%
I hope!

585
00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:37.666 line:83%
They must feed these
lucky cows weed all day,

586
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:39.625 line:83%
because when
they milk 'em - boom!

587
00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:41.291 line:83%
[high-pitched] Dream cream!

588
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:42.625 line:83%
What did you just say?

589
00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:43.750 line:83%
[high-pitched] Dream cream.

590
00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:45.583 line:83%
Huh!

591
00:23:48.625 --> 00:23:51.416 line:83%
We're fucked.
We're majorly fucked.

592
00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:53.125 line:83%
You know, we don't
deserve this shit.

593
00:23:53.125 --> 00:23:54.541 line:83%
All we did was tell one lie.

594
00:23:54.541 --> 00:23:57.083 line:83%
Hundreds and hundreds of times
over many, many years.

595
00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.333 line:83%
Hey, maybe they'll forget

596
00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:01.541 line:83%
that they invited Stanicky
to the bris.

597
00:24:01.541 --> 00:24:03.666 line:83%
They'll be so busy
with the family and friends,

598
00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:04.750 line:83%
and cutting of penises.

599
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.666 line:83%
They're not going to forget
they invited him, Wes.

600
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:09.416 line:83%
I got it. My boy Jonesy.

601
00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:11.208 line:83%
He works for one of
those online obituaries.

602
00:24:11.208 --> 00:24:13.083 line:83%
We could kill Stanicky off.

603
00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:14.916 line:83%
I like that.
Let's kill his ass.

604
00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:16.416 line:83%
Put your hands down, shit nuts.

605
00:24:16.416 --> 00:24:19.916 line:83%
Obituaries give details.
Friends, family, cemeteries.

606
00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:22.166 line:83%
Plus then everyone's going to
want to go to the funeral.

607
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:25.375 line:83%
Okay, Dean,
your negativity is not helping.

608
00:24:27.458 --> 00:24:32.250 line:83%
Or, uh, we could go do
my original plan...

609
00:24:33.166 --> 00:24:34.750 line:83%
... and tell everybody
the truth.

610
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.958 line:83%
Shut your mouth.
Shut your stupid mouth.

611
00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:38.291 line:83%
We're not telling the truth.

612
00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:39.916 line:83%
There'll be no truth told,
okay?

613
00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:41.708 line:83%
We're going to do
the right thing here.

614
00:24:41.708 --> 00:24:43.291 line:83%
Some would argue
that telling the truth

615
00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:44.500 line:83%
is the right thing to do.

616
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.666 line:83%
Yeah - assholes!

617
00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:48.125 line:83%
Let me remind you guys of
what the truth is, dream cream.

618
00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:49.583 line:83%
Last night,
when I was in New Jersey

619
00:24:49.583 --> 00:24:51.750 line:83%
secretly partying my face off
at the Marc Rebillet concert,

620
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.166 line:83%
my wife was giving birth
to my son.

621
00:24:53.166 --> 00:24:54.291 line:83%
Alone! Okay?

622
00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:56.375 line:83%
And if the truth does come out,
my marriage is over.

623
00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:58.416 line:83%
And later, if my son finds out,

I had a couple of those
in the plane - they pass.

The nice fella I walked off
the plane with, he helped me.

What fella?

789
00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:36.750 line:83%
He was just... he was just
here. You didn't see him?

790

Curly eyes. Long blonde lips.
He talks with a limp.

All right, uh,

792
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.708 line:83%
how about we just take
a little whiff of vodka,

793
00:32:41.708 --> 00:32:43.208 line:83%
you know,
just to take the edge off?

794
00:32:43.208 --> 00:32:44.375 line:83%
-Yeah. A little bit.
-Yeah?

795
00:32:44.375 --> 00:32:46.750 line:83%
No, you hired me to play
the role of a sober gentleman.

796
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.541 line:83%
I'm going to do so
the only way I know how -

797
00:32:48.541 --> 00:32:50.500 line:83%
with artistic integrity.

798
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.541 line:83%
What is that?
Is somebody boiling lobster?

799
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.041 line:83%
Boiling what? Oh, Rod.

It's just piss.

00:33:02.875 --> 00:33:04.333 line:83%
Oh, thank God.

00:33:07.833 --> 00:33:10.583 line:83%
[Rod] I can't believe you guys
picked me up in this thing.

We'll give you half now

Wes, can you please take
Mr. Stanicky

823
00:33:51.708 --> 00:33:53.333 line:83%
over to your place
and shower him off

824
00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:55.083 line:83%
and then bring him
over to JT's?

825
00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:58.625 line:83%
It's 'Ricky'. Mr. Stanicky
is my fake father's name.

826
00:33:58.625 --> 00:34:02.291 line:83%
Um, hey, I don't think
that's going to be a good idea.

827

way before you. Just...

831

make him presentable, please.

Starting to feel
a little human again.

842
00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:47.541 line:83%
Yeah. Hey, let me
ask you something.

843
00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:50.250 line:83%
You're a raging alcoholic,
right?

844
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.541 line:83%
Yeah.

845
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:53.500 line:83%
Well, then how do
you stay so ripped?

846
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.166 line:83%
-Roids. Shit-ton of roids.
-Hmm.

847
00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:58.791 line:83%
I got addicted to those too.

848
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:01.208 line:83%
God, they're good.

00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:09.166 line:83%
Wow. Gay much?

850
00:35:09.166 --> 00:35:11.625 line:83%
Yeah. I was really
feeling it that day.

851
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.250 line:83%
Oh, so this is your, um...

852
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.500 line:83%
Partner, Keith. Mmm.

853
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.791 line:83%
Of course.

854
00:35:21.791 --> 00:35:25.125 line:83%
By the way, I kind of told him
that you were bi.

855
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:27.125 line:83%
What? Why?

856
00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.625 line:83%
Because it'd be weird
if you weren't...

857
00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:30.875 line:83%
since we dated.

858
00:35:30.875 --> 00:35:33.416 line:83%
We dated? You and me?
Was that in the bible?

859
00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:36.541 line:83%
-I missed that.
-No, it's not in there.

860
00:35:36.541 --> 00:35:38.250 line:83%
Why the hell
wasn't it in the bible?

861
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.833 line:83%
Well, 'cause I couldn't tell
the guys. All right?

862
00:35:40.833 --> 00:35:43.208 line:83%
Look, look, I didn't know
how things would go

863
00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:44.791 line:83%
on my first date with Keith.

864
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:47.291 line:83%
So I told him I was seeing
this dude named Ricky Stanicky,

865
00:35:47.291 --> 00:35:48.833 line:83%
in case I needed an out.

866
00:35:48.833 --> 00:35:51.458 line:83%
But we hit it off
and I told him we broke up.

867
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:53.416 line:83%
Okay, no problem.

868
00:35:53.416 --> 00:35:57.833 line:83%
Unfortunately, Keith's still
a little threatened by you.

869
00:35:59.875 --> 00:36:02.833 line:83%
Okay, spill the beans.
I got to know everything.

870
00:36:02.833 --> 00:36:04.791 line:83%
-What did you tell him we did?
-What do you mean?

871
00:36:04.791 --> 00:36:07.208 line:83%
Cut the crap.
You know what I mean.

872
00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:09.166 line:83%
Did we play Winnie the Pooh
finds a honey stick?

873
00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:11.208 line:83%
-What's that?
-Munchkins in a cave?

874
00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:12.541 line:83%
Upside-down barber?

875
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:13.791 line:83%
Shaved biscuits and gravy?

876
00:36:13.791 --> 00:36:14.916 line:83%
-No.
-Old faceful?

877
00:36:14.916 --> 00:36:17.708 line:83%
No! We just went on
a couple of dates.

878
00:36:18.875 --> 00:36:21.333 line:83%
Oh. I guess
I didn't do it for you.

879
00:36:22.208 --> 00:36:24.083 line:83%
You're no trophy either,
beagle ears.

880
00:36:26.916 --> 00:36:28.625 line:83%
Hey, what's this?

881
00:36:28.625 --> 00:36:32.833 line:83%
Oh, it's just this...
this children's book thing

882
00:36:32.833 --> 00:36:35.208 line:83%
that I've been tinkering with.

883
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.333 line:83%
Hey, there he is!
Our mohel, Rabbi Greenberg.

884
00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:45.750 line:83%
You can call me
Rabbi Gigglebird.

885
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.166 line:83%
[laughter]

886
00:36:47.166 --> 00:36:48.666 line:83%
The Rabbi
does stand-up sometimes

887

890
00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:56.625 line:83%
Cheese puffs, anyone?

891
00:36:56.625 --> 00:37:00.000 line:83%
Oh, no, we mohels,
we prefer those little weenies.

892
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.541 line:83%
Ba-doomp-pow!

893
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:04.291 line:83%
Oh, no... [chuckles awkwardly]

894
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:05.750 line:83%
Listen. Listen.

895
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.708 line:83%
My services here today
are complimentary,

896
00:37:07.708 --> 00:37:09.208 line:83%
just so you know, all right?

897
00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:11.125 line:83%
I consider this a mitzvah.
All right?

898
00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:12.625 line:83%
I don't want any money,

899
00:37:12.625 --> 00:37:15.000 line:83%
but I'm keeping the tip!

900
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.166 line:83%
[laughs]

901
00:37:16.166 --> 00:37:18.666 line:83%
-They just keep on coming, huh?
-Yeah, they don't stop.

902
00:37:18.666 --> 00:37:20.375 line:83%
-All right.
-You're hungry, I bet.

903
00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:21.375 line:83%
Always.

904
00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:23.833 line:83%
Please. You got to fill up
before you... Right?

905
00:37:23.833 --> 00:37:26.750 line:83%
-Go. It's all you, baby.
-Yeah, yeah. Go get it. Dig in.

906
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.875 line:83%
[Rabbi] Back off the vodka,
lady.

907
00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:31.583 line:83%
Oh, Jesus Christ.

908
00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:35.083 line:83%
Can I get a gin and tonic?
And let's make it a double.

909
00:37:35.083 --> 00:37:36.500 line:83%
What the fuck
is Summerhayes doing here?

910
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.708 line:83%
I invited him.

911
00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:39.958 line:83%
-Oh, my God.
-Babe, why would you do that?

912
00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:41.375 line:83%
Because he's your boss.

913
00:37:41.375 --> 00:37:43.791 line:83%
Yeah. I don't want to
hang out with my boss.

914
00:37:43.791 --> 00:37:45.958 line:83%
Why not? You invited him
to the baby shower, shithead.

915
00:37:45.958 --> 00:37:49.000 line:83%
That's different. This is
a cock-cutting ceremony.

916
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.166 line:83%
I don't want him here.

917
00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:52.750 line:83%
Jesus Christ, you're being
weird. Just go say hi.

918
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.291 line:83%
Both of you. Go.

919
00:37:54.291 --> 00:37:56.500 line:83%
Great. This is just great.

920
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.458 line:83%
Now if Stanicky shits the bed,
we lose our jobs.

921
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.291 line:83%
God, where is he?
He should be here by now.

922
00:38:01.791 --> 00:38:03.333 line:83%
[Rod] Explain it again.

923
00:38:03.333 --> 00:38:05.791 line:83%
It's a children's story
about these seeds

924
00:38:05.791 --> 00:38:08.333 line:83%
that are flying in the breeze,

925
00:38:08.333 --> 00:38:11.291 line:83%
and all they want to do is
reach the top of this mountain.

926
00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:15.166 line:83%
But there's this one little
seed who gets blown back

927
00:38:15.166 --> 00:38:17.208 line:83%
to the bottom of the mountain,

928
00:38:17.208 --> 00:38:19.333 line:83%
and she's all like, "Fuck!"

929
00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:22.750 line:83%
But when it starts to rain,
all the water will start

930
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:26.875 line:83%
to flow down the side of
the mountain straight to her.

931
00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:29.500 line:83%
So she'll sprout
and she'll grow and grow

932
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.916 line:83%
to be the biggest tree of all,

933
00:38:30.916 --> 00:38:33.333 line:83%
even bigger than the ones
on top of the mountain.

934
00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:34.958 line:83%
The message being,

935
00:38:34.958 --> 00:38:38.541 line:83%
you can be great in life,
no matter where you start.

936
00:38:40.916 --> 00:38:42.500 line:83%
Hot, wet shit.

937
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.208 line:83%
What-what...
what are you talking about?

938
00:38:44.208 --> 00:38:45.875 line:83%
Come on, man,
you're not a farmer.

939
00:38:45.875 --> 00:38:47.958 line:83%
What the hell do you
know about seeds, right?

940
00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.458 line:83%
And the message is absurd.

941
00:38:49.458 --> 00:38:53.500 line:83%
Poor kids turn into trees?
It doesn't make any sense.

942
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.583 line:83%
-You're right.
-Right?

943
00:38:54.583 --> 00:38:55.833 line:83%
It is stupid. It's stupid!

944
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.666 line:83%
What the fuck
was I thinking, man? Yeah.

945
00:38:57.666 --> 00:38:58.833 line:83%
I should just give up.

946
00:38:58.833 --> 00:39:00.916 line:83%
Whoa. No.
That's not what I said.

947
00:39:00.916 --> 00:39:02.541 line:83%
I said this is crap,

948
00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:04.291 line:83%
because it's not authentic.

949
00:39:04.291 --> 00:39:06.083 line:83%
Doesn't mean you gotta give up.

950
00:39:07.125 --> 00:39:08.875 line:83%
Let me tell you a story,
cowboy.

951
00:39:08.875 --> 00:39:10.291 line:83%
A few years back,

952
00:39:10.291 --> 00:39:12.708 line:83%
I had an X-rated dog show
at the Showboat.

953
00:39:12.708 --> 00:39:15.625 line:83%
I had these two mutts that
could bang missionary style.

954
00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:17.958 line:83%
Oh, yeah, you heard me right.
Missionary!

955
00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:20.000 line:83%
Face-to-face. Real deal.

956
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.541 line:83%
It was kind of touching,
actually.

957
00:39:21.541 --> 00:39:23.000 line:83%
Then Atlantic City
gets all woke

958
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.541 line:83%
and they won't let 'em pump
on stage anymore.

959
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:28.333 line:83%
I tried doing the show with
two guys in dog suits, but...

960
00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:29.708 line:83%
the magic just wasn't there.

961
00:39:29.708 --> 00:39:30.750 line:83%
You know what I mean?

962
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:34.458 line:83%
-No.
-My point is, I failed.

963
00:39:34.458 --> 00:39:36.375 line:83%
But did I give up? Heck no.

964
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:38.333 line:83%
I just had to ask myself,
what do I love?

965
00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:39.333 line:83%
And then it was easy -

966
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:41.583 line:83%
singing, performing
and telling filthy jokes.

967
00:39:41.583 --> 00:39:44.541 line:83%
And that is when Rock Hard Rod
was born.

968
00:39:44.541 --> 00:39:47.666 line:83%
You, sir, have just found out

969
00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:51.333 line:83%
your dogs can no longer bang
missionary style.

970
00:39:51.333 --> 00:39:54.333 line:83%
Now you got to ask yourself,
what do you love?

971
00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:56.208 line:83%
-What do I love?
-Yeah.

972
00:39:56.208 --> 00:39:57.791 line:83%
Ah... [mumbles]

973
00:39:58.458 --> 00:40:00.791 line:83%
Yeah, I... I like ceramic owls?

974
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:03.416 line:83%
Uh... I love fog.

975
00:40:03.416 --> 00:40:05.166 line:83%
I love fog! I love it.

976
00:40:05.166 --> 00:40:07.375 line:83%
Er, is there anything
that you like

977
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:10.916 line:83%
that a regular human being
can relate to on any level?

978
00:40:12.458 --> 00:40:14.250 line:83%
-I like Christmas.
-Christmas, Christmas!

979
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.583 line:83%
Perfect! Yes!
Everybody loves Christmas.

980
00:40:16.583 --> 00:40:18.166 line:83%
Yeah, well, not everybody.

981
00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:20.541 line:83%
Keith is not a big fan of it
these days.

982
00:40:20.541 --> 00:40:22.791 line:83%
-He doesn't love Christmas?
-Well, he used to love it.

983
00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:23.791 line:83%
But, I mean,

984
00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:25.916 line:83%
ever since his parents
found out that we were dating,

985
00:40:25.916 --> 00:40:27.583 line:83%
they haven't really
invited him over.

986
00:40:27.583 --> 00:40:30.041 line:83%
-That sucks.
-Yeah.

987
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:31.583 line:83%
Which is their loss, you know.

988
00:40:31.583 --> 00:40:33.208 line:83%
No "Jerky of the Month Club"
for them.

989
00:40:33.208 --> 00:40:34.833 line:83%
Ha.

990
00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:37.250 line:83%
I just wish there was
a holiday tradition for us.

991
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:40.500 line:83%
You know, like Christmas is
the gayest holiday anyway, man.

992
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.708 line:83%
You know, you bedazzle
a tree with tinsel.

993
00:40:43.416 --> 00:40:45.791 line:83%
And why does Santa
have to be such a fat shit?

994
00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:48.041 line:83%
Couldn't he be ripped? Couldn't
he be jacked? You know?

995
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:49.875 line:83%
Can the elves have
ordered him a Peloton

996
00:40:49.875 --> 00:40:51.375 line:83%
or a yoga mat or something?

997
00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:54.000 line:83%
Ra-pum-pum-pum.

998
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.083 line:83%
Now that is authentic!

999
00:40:57.125 --> 00:40:59.708 line:83%
Yeah. A Christmas story for us.

1000
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.875 line:83%
Thanks for coming, Ted.

1001
00:41:03.875 --> 00:41:06.500 line:83%
I know a bris
isn't exactly your cup of tea.

1002
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.000 line:83%
Oh, no, we're happy
that you invited us, JT.

1003
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.375 line:83%
This is exactly
what Ted needed.

1004
00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:14.708 line:83%
He's been so obsessed
with this World River merger.

1005
00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:16.208 line:83%
Yeah.

1006
00:41:16.208 --> 00:41:19.333 line:83%
Circumcision parties are
my go-to when I need to relax.

1007
00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:21.083 line:83%
[nervous chuckling]

1008
00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:22.750 line:83%
Where's Gary?
I thought he was coming.

1009
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.250 line:83%
He has his improv class
at Trinity,

1010
00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.708 line:83%
but I think he'll be here soon.

1011
00:41:25.708 --> 00:41:27.291 line:83%
Have you guys seen
his new commercial?

1012
00:41:27.291 --> 00:41:28.916 line:83%
[Dean] Yeah. Yeah.

1013
00:41:28.916 --> 00:41:31.291 line:83%
-He got off.
-Who got off?

1014
00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:32.916 line:83%
My big story
I'm covering this week.

1015
00:41:32.916 --> 00:41:34.750 line:83%
You're covering a trial?

1016
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:36.541 line:83%
No, real reporters
get to do that.

1017
00:41:36.541 --> 00:41:38.833 line:83%
I'm covering a vicious duck
sitting on a golf ball

1018
00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:40.416 line:83%
-at Wannamoisett Country Club.
-Oh.

1019
00:41:40.416 --> 00:41:41.916 line:83%
You're just paying
your dues, right?

1020
00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:44.750 line:83%
You're going to get a shot
at the big story soon.

1021
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.750 line:83%
Thanks, babe.

1022
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.333 line:83%
He's not coming, is he?

1023
00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:50.541 line:83%
-Who would you be referring to?
-Oh, don't give me that.

1024
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:53.083 line:83%
Ricky Stanicky.
Where the hell is he?

1025
00:41:53.083 --> 00:41:55.958 line:83%
Oh, he'll be here.
This is just typical Ricky.

1026
00:41:55.958 --> 00:41:57.541 line:83%
He's... he's always late.

1027
00:41:57.541 --> 00:42:00.083 line:83%
Hmm. Well, I'll believe it
when I see it.

1028
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:03.541 line:83%
Leona, come on.
Why wouldn't he come?

1029
00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:05.125 line:83%
Probably for the same reason

1030
00:42:05.125 --> 00:42:08.708 line:83%
that he didn't bother to show
up for JT and Susan's wedding.

1031
00:42:08.708 --> 00:42:10.916 line:83%
Sorry he didn't think
my wedding was more important

1032
00:42:10.916 --> 00:42:13.333 line:83%
than digging out hurricane
victims in the Bahamas.

1033
00:42:13.333 --> 00:42:14.541 line:83%
Ooh.

1034
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:17.375 line:83%
Ha, ha!
The old Bahamian hurricane.

1035
00:42:17.375 --> 00:42:20.000 line:83%
Jackie, tell me about
Ricky Stanicky.

1036
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.458 line:83%
I mean, if they were
such good friends,

1037
00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:25.250 line:83%
you must have met him a bunch
when they were kids, right?

1038
00:42:25.833 --> 00:42:28.791 line:83%
Oh, sure.
I... I met all of JT's friends.

1039
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:30.083 line:83%
Really?

1040
00:42:30.083 --> 00:42:33.000 line:83%
Do you have any
specific memories of him?

1041
00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:37.416 line:83%
Well, I remember he was
a handful, that's for sure.

1042
00:42:37.416 --> 00:42:39.583 line:83%
I mean, every time
this one got in trouble,

1043
00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:41.125 line:83%
Stanicky was somehow behind it.

1044
00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:43.125 line:83%
He was a... a little devil,
that Ricky.

1045
00:42:43.125 --> 00:42:44.875 line:83%
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.
-Wow!

1046
00:42:44.875 --> 00:42:47.250 line:83%
That doesn't sound like
the same guy

1047
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:52.416 line:83%
who works for Bono in Africa
and builds orphanages in Peru.

1048
00:42:53.708 --> 00:42:55.250 line:83%
That's 'cause he's born again.

1049
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.500 line:83%
-Ah.
-He had that epiphany in rehab.

1050
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.125 line:83%
Remember I told you about that?

1051
00:42:59.125 --> 00:43:01.208 line:83%
-Mm-hm.
-Yeah, people change, Leona.

1052
00:43:01.208 --> 00:43:03.250 line:83%
Why are you grilling my mom?
She's not on trial.

1053
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.708 line:83%
Because I want you to admit

1054
00:43:04.708 --> 00:43:07.041 line:83%
that Ricky Stanicky
does not exist.

1055
00:43:10.166 --> 00:43:12.875 line:83%
Hey, mishpocha!

1056
00:43:12.875 --> 00:43:15.041 line:83%
Let's get down to bris-ness!

1057
00:43:15.041 --> 00:43:16.666 line:83%
[all exclaim]

1058
00:43:16.666 --> 00:43:18.791 line:83%
Oh, yes! Yeah-ah!

1059
00:43:18.791 --> 00:43:20.208 line:83%
[JT] You made it!

1060
00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:22.625 line:83%
The boys are back!

1061
00:43:22.625 --> 00:43:24.958 line:83%
[all exclaim]

1062
00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:27.000 line:83%
-All right.
-Jackie!

1063
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.333 line:83%
Ricky?

1064
00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:31.500 line:83%
Oh, you look unbelievable.
You're still a MILF.

1065
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.291 line:83%
[chuckling] Oh, my God.

1066
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:36.250 line:83%
Look at you.
Oh, you haven't changed a bit.

1067
00:43:37.291 --> 00:43:38.958 line:83%
The mystery man in the flesh.

1068
00:43:38.958 --> 00:43:41.458 line:83%
Well, churn my butter
with a slippery stick.

1069
00:43:41.458 --> 00:43:42.958 line:83%
I finally get to meet
Erin Harford.

1070
00:43:42.958 --> 00:43:44.625 line:83%
You're even more beautiful
in person

1071
00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:46.375 line:83%
than the pictures
Dean's always sending me.

1072
00:43:46.375 --> 00:43:47.750 line:83%
You send him pictures of me?

1073
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.291 line:83%
Oh, tasteful, of course.

1074
00:43:49.291 --> 00:43:50.375 line:83%
Even the nudes.

1075
00:43:50.375 --> 00:43:52.208 line:83%
Seriously, the guy
doesn't shut up about you.

1076
00:43:52.208 --> 00:43:54.166 line:83%
What were you saying
about her last week?

1077
00:43:54.166 --> 00:43:55.750 line:83%
It was, um...

1078
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:57.541 line:83%
Ah!
The more I look at her,

1079
00:43:57.541 --> 00:43:59.541 line:83%
the more I realize
how much there is to see.

1080
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:01.791 line:83%
-Aw. Babe.
-And who do we have here?

1081
00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:04.333 line:83%
Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair!

1082
00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:06.500 line:83%
[meekly] I'm Carly,
I'm Erin's cousin.

1083
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.125 line:83%
No need to shout, bullhorn!

1084
00:44:08.125 --> 00:44:09.666 line:83%
[light laughter]

1085
00:44:09.666 --> 00:44:12.833 line:83%
And I am the woman
who had to give birth all alone

1086
00:44:12.833 --> 00:44:15.250 line:83%
because you tricked her husband
into going to Albany.

1087
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:17.041 line:83%
Oh, my God, Susan,
I'm so sorry.

1088
00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:18.125 line:83%
[exhales regretfully]

1089
00:44:18.125 --> 00:44:20.250 line:83%
You know how much grief
your old man's been giving me?

1090
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.666 line:83%
For the record, I had no idea
it was your baby shower.

1091
00:44:22.666 --> 00:44:24.375 line:83%
I just wanted to celebrate
my new lease on life

1092
00:44:24.375 --> 00:44:25.666 line:83%
with my oldest,
dearest friends.

1093
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:28.333 line:83%
Then little Whitaker
comes along...

1094
00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:29.833 line:83%
God, I love that name.

1095
00:44:31.041 --> 00:44:33.500 line:83%
And then I just
ruin everything.

1096
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.375 line:83%
I just...
Again, my sincerest apologies.

1097
00:44:36.375 --> 00:44:37.958 line:83%
No, you know, it...

1098
00:44:37.958 --> 00:44:40.416 line:83%
It's okay. I know you've
been through a lot, so...

1099
00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:42.708 line:83%
Hell, yeah, they lopped off
one of my nuts, for starters.

1100
00:44:42.708 --> 00:44:45.708 line:83%
-[laughter]
-Oh, you are still a handful!

1101
00:44:45.708 --> 00:44:47.333 line:83%
Well, half a handful.

1102
00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:48.708 line:83%
-[chortles]
-Ricky...

1103
00:44:48.708 --> 00:44:51.166 line:83%
Okay, Rico! Hey, let's go
show you around. Huh?

1104
00:44:51.166 --> 00:44:52.791 line:83%
Aren't you going to
Introduce me?

1105
00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:54.500 line:83%
Uh, we'll be right back.

1106
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.750 line:83%
[whispers] Stay away from
that woman at all costs, okay?

1107
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.833 line:83%
That's Susan's mother.
She's bad news.

1108
00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:03.875 line:83%
Jesus.

1109
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:07.833 line:83%
Hey, if anyone asks
about the shaking, just say,

1110
00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:09.833 line:83%
"I have low blood sugar
and I had a Red Bull."

1111
00:45:09.833 --> 00:45:11.166 line:83%
Stopping you there.

1112
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:13.750 line:83%
I don't appreciate
line readings.

1113
00:45:15.125 --> 00:45:16.333 line:83%
What?

1114
00:45:16.333 --> 00:45:18.041 line:83%
So, I lift up the mosquito net

1115
00:45:18.041 --> 00:45:20.208 line:83%
and, sure enough,
Bono's in there.

1116
00:45:20.208 --> 00:45:22.208 line:83%
Plowing Mrs. Bono
like a potato field.

1117
00:45:22.208 --> 00:45:23.750 line:83%
Really? The Bono?

1118
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:27.416 line:83%
Yeah. Givin' the missus the old
Irish shillelagh, as it were.

1119
00:45:27.416 --> 00:45:28.916 line:83%
So I'm standing there
embarrassed.

1120
00:45:28.916 --> 00:45:30.625 line:83%
And then they go,
[Irish accent] "It's okay.

1121
00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:31.875 line:83%
"Watch us, we like it."

1122
00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:33.291 line:83%
Is that an Irish thing?

1123
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:36.375 line:83%
I don't think so. But
I wouldn't put it past them.

1124
00:45:36.375 --> 00:45:39.250 line:83%
Hey, the guy saved ten million
people from starving.

1125
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:41.000 line:83%
So, if he wants to let people

1126
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.875 line:83%
watch him corn-beef his wife's
cabbage, who am I to stop him?

1127
00:45:43.875 --> 00:45:47.125 line:83%
You know who has the best
corn-beef in town? Geoff's.

1128
00:45:47.125 --> 00:45:49.166 line:83%
And it isn't even really
a deli.

1129
00:45:49.166 --> 00:45:51.125 line:83%
I don't think that's
the kind of corn-beef

1130
00:45:51.125 --> 00:45:52.500 line:83%
he's talking about, Ginny.

1131
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.541 line:83%
Oh, man, all this food talk
is making me hungry.

1132
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:56.500 line:83%
-Ricky, have you eaten yet?
-[Summerhayes] Dean.

1133
00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.916 line:83%
You haven't introduced me
to Indiana Jones here.

1134
00:46:00.916 --> 00:46:02.500 line:83%
Yeah, of course.

1135
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.083 line:83%
Ted, this is Ricky Stanicky,
my good friend.

1136
00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:06.875 line:83%
Uh, Ricky, this is
Ted Summerhayes, my boss.

1137
00:46:06.875 --> 00:46:07.958 line:83%
Ted, nice to meet you.

1138
00:46:07.958 --> 00:46:10.166 line:83%
Digging the suit
and the seedlings, man.

1139
00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:11.541 line:83%
The seedlings?

1140
00:46:11.541 --> 00:46:13.208 line:83%
The hair plugs.
They're new, right?

1141
00:46:13.208 --> 00:46:14.416 line:83%
What?

1142
00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:17.250 line:83%
No. This is my hair.

1143
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:20.291 line:83%
Ha! Yeah, just like
a doll's hair is her hair.

1144
00:46:20.291 --> 00:46:21.583 line:83%
That's good. That's good.

1145
00:46:22.083 --> 00:46:24.500 line:83%
So, Ted, you're one of those
big banker guys, eh?

1146
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:25.708 line:83%
One of those guys out there

1147
00:46:25.708 --> 00:46:27.375 line:83%
helping those billionaires
get richer

1148
00:46:27.375 --> 00:46:29.750 line:83%
and then floating around on
your big swinging super-yachts,

1149
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.708 line:83%
leaving everybody else
struggling to make ends meet

1150
00:46:31.708 --> 00:46:32.708 line:83%
in their little dinghies.

1151
00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:35.500 line:83%
-No. No, no, no. Not at all...
-First of all,

1152
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.291 line:83%
we sell financial services
to independent investors,

1153
00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:41.583 line:83%
and anyone
who's willing to pay for them

1154
00:46:41.583 --> 00:46:44.041 line:83%
is welcome
to share in the benefits.

1155
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:46.125 line:83%
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, Ebenezer.

1156
00:46:46.125 --> 00:46:48.083 line:83%
[chuckling nervously]
Uh, if memory serves me,

1157
00:46:48.083 --> 00:46:49.333 line:83%
Ebenezer Scrooge ends up

1158
00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:50.833 line:83%
becoming the hero
of that story.

1159
00:46:50.833 --> 00:46:53.083 line:83%
-It's Ricky, right?
-[Rod] Yeah.

1160
00:46:53.083 --> 00:46:57.375 line:83%
I'm wondering, Ricky, are you
always such a bust-out asshole,

1161
00:46:57.375 --> 00:46:58.791 line:83%
right out of the gate?

1162
00:46:58.791 --> 00:47:00.416 line:83%
Only when I'm talking
to the type of guy

1163
00:47:00.416 --> 00:47:02.583 line:83%
who can make a real
difference in this world.

1164
00:47:02.583 --> 00:47:04.916 line:83%
Ted, Ricky's been
working overseas

1165
00:47:04.916 --> 00:47:07.041 line:83%
for the last decade
on non-profits.

1166
00:47:07.041 --> 00:47:10.333 line:83%
So at least he walks the walk.

1167
00:47:10.958 --> 00:47:13.208 line:83%
Well, that's nice,

1168
00:47:13.208 --> 00:47:16.541 line:83%
but he's obviously getting
his financial information

1169
00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:17.875 line:83%
from 'The Huffington Post'.

1170
00:47:17.875 --> 00:47:19.458 line:83%
No, actually, I've been reading

1171
00:47:19.458 --> 00:47:20.916 line:83%
the 'San Francisco Chronicle'
lately.

1172
00:47:20.916 --> 00:47:21.916 line:83%
I've been following

1173
00:47:21.916 --> 00:47:23.333 line:83%
your potential merger
with World River.

1174
00:47:23.333 --> 00:47:24.875 line:83%
It's interesting, unexpected.

1175
00:47:26.041 --> 00:47:27.958 line:83%
Okay, hey, uh,
there's a ton of people inside

1176
00:47:27.958 --> 00:47:30.250 line:83%
-that still wanna meet you.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1177
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.500 line:83%
I'd like to hear this.

1178
00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:34.500 line:83%
Unexpected, how?

1179
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.375 line:83%
[Rod] Oh, come on.

1180
00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:38.750 line:83%
They're the yin,
and you got that big old yang.

1181
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.250 line:83%
It's a perfect fit.

1182
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:42.166 line:83%
In what way?

1183
00:47:42.166 --> 00:47:46.000 line:83%
Well, you're old school.
They're new age.

1184
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.666 line:83%
You got common sense,
but they got radical new ideas.

1185
00:47:48.666 --> 00:47:50.166 line:83%
For my money,
I'm going common sense

1186
00:47:50.166 --> 00:47:51.625 line:83%
over radical new ideas all day.

1187
00:47:51.625 --> 00:47:53.750 line:83%
I'm sure the people in Portland
and San Francisco agree.

1188
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.250 line:83%
And that's what
makes you guys great.

1189
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:57.000 line:83%
But they're pretty good too.

1190
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.041 line:83%
But, together, you guys
would be unstoppable.

1191
00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:03.541 line:83%
This merger could make a real
difference in this world, Ted.

1192
00:48:03.541 --> 00:48:04.791 line:83%
A real difference.

1193
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.916 line:83%
Yin and yang, huh?

1194
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.666 line:83%
Oh, don't mind if I do. Thanks.

1195
00:48:16.916 --> 00:48:19.208 line:83%
Where the hell did you hear
about the World River deal?

1196
00:48:19.208 --> 00:48:20.750 line:83%
They were all over
your Twitter.

1197
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.125 line:83%
I just did a little research.

1198
00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:23.833 line:83%
What are you doing
on my Twitter?

1199
00:48:23.833 --> 00:48:25.708 line:83%
Dean, I told you I'm an actor.

1200
00:48:25.708 --> 00:48:27.041 line:83%
When I walk into a room,

1201
00:48:27.041 --> 00:48:28.666 line:83%
I want to know exactly
where I came from

1202
00:48:28.666 --> 00:48:30.875 line:83%
and what every single person
in that room's been doing.

1203
00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:32.666 line:83%
That's what all the greats do.

1204
00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:34.166 line:83%
Matt Damon
actually bought a zoo

1205
00:48:34.166 --> 00:48:35.583 line:83%
before he filmed
'We Bought a Zoo'.

1206
00:48:35.583 --> 00:48:37.041 line:83%
I don't think that's true.

1207
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:39.000 line:83%
You don't believe me?
Take it up with Reddit.

1208
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.583 line:83%
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

1209
00:48:41.583 --> 00:48:43.125 line:83%
I got to go
have a word with Keith.

1210
00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:45.583 line:83%
What? How do you know Keith?!

1211
00:48:46.666 --> 00:48:50.416 line:83%
We're in a weird
love-triangle thing.

1212
00:48:51.875 --> 00:48:55.541 line:83%
Look, all I'm saying is I hope
there's no hard feelings.

1213
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:57.458 line:83%
Because let's face it,
you won.

1214
00:48:58.291 --> 00:48:59.541 line:83%
But I'm happy for you.

1215
00:48:59.541 --> 00:49:01.166 line:83%
You guys make
a fabulous couple.

1216
00:49:01.166 --> 00:49:03.041 line:83%
I'm done with his ass.

1217
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.166 line:83%
Look, I still love the guy,

1218
00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:09.000 line:83%
but I'm tired of working
60 hours a week

1219
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.916 line:83%
while he sits around not doing
anything to improve himself.

1220
00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:13.208 line:83%
I just...

1221
00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:16.083 line:83%
I can't be with a person
like that anymore.

1222
00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:19.166 line:83%
What... what about his writing?
That's work.

1223
00:49:19.166 --> 00:49:20.958 line:83%
What writing?

1224
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:22.583 line:83%
The book he's working on.

1225
00:49:23.208 --> 00:49:26.000 line:83%
He never told me
he was writing a book.

1226
00:49:26.958 --> 00:49:29.291 line:83%
He sure looks a lot older
than you guys.

1227
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:30.541 line:83%
-Really?
-Mmm.

1228
00:49:30.541 --> 00:49:32.500 line:83%
Yeah, well, he is,
by a couple years.

1229
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.375 line:83%
You know, we were like
little brothers to him.

1230
00:49:35.375 --> 00:49:39.791 line:83%
Hmm, no, I mean, like more
than a couple of years.

1231
00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:42.000 line:83%
Well, it's because
of the drugs - he...

1232
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000 line:83%
You know, he was a huge
partier, back in the day.

1233
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.791 line:83%
I mean, like hard drugs.

1234
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:48.083 line:83%
Huffing glue. Like, the works.

1235
00:49:48.583 --> 00:49:50.875 line:83%
I mean, that'll suck the youth
right out of your face.

1236
00:49:50.875 --> 00:49:51.875 line:83%
It does.

1237
00:49:52.416 --> 00:49:53.916 line:83%
Yeah, that was all before

-Hmm.

1239
00:49:56.416 --> 00:49:58.916 line:83%
Oh, look at them.
Look how happy they are.

-[JT] I told you.
-[Rabbi] It's an easy thing.

1241
00:50:01.208 --> 00:50:03.333 line:83%
-[Dean] I don't see happiness.
-[Erin] What?

1242
00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:05.625 line:83%
I see fear and anxiety.

1243
00:50:05.625 --> 00:50:07.333 line:83%
Fear of what?

1244
00:50:07.333 --> 00:50:09.000 line:83%
[Dean] Of the responsibility
of it all.

1245
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.500 line:83%
What do they even
get out of it?

1246
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.833 line:83%
What do they get
out of having a family?

1247
00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:14.125 line:83%
-Yeah.
-Come on.

1248
00:50:14.125 --> 00:50:17.375 line:83%
I mean, I get it on paper.
Sure, right.

1249
00:50:17.375 --> 00:50:20.666 line:83%
But in reality, having a kid
is fear and anxiety

1250
00:50:20.666 --> 00:50:22.625 line:83%
with periodic moments
of crushing pain.

1251
00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:25.708 line:83%
And then you get
bitter and resentful

1252
00:50:25.708 --> 00:50:28.333 line:83%
and eventually just... mean.

1253
00:50:30.375 --> 00:50:32.541 line:83%
At least that's how it was
at my house.

1254
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.500 line:83%
You realize that's
the most you've ever

1255
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.000 line:83%
told me about your childhood?

1256
00:50:38.625 --> 00:50:41.041 line:83%
[Rod] Look, he is
kind of lost right now,

1257
00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:43.291 line:83%
but just give him a little
time, he'll figure it out.

1258
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:46.291 line:83%
I've given him plenty of time.

1259
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.750 line:83%
I think you need
to step back in, Ricky.

1260
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.416 line:83%
Be there for him.

1261
00:50:51.416 --> 00:50:53.500 line:83%
Ease the blow a little
when I drop him.

1262
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.416 line:83%
Oh, hey, Keith, slow down.

1263
00:50:55.416 --> 00:50:57.125 line:83%
Take it from me,
relationships like yours,

1264
00:50:57.125 --> 00:50:58.625 line:83%
they don't come around
that often.

1265
00:50:58.625 --> 00:50:59.625 line:83%
They just don't.

My own mother
was married six times.

1267

An incredible sex life,

1269
00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:06.791 line:83%
but she was filled up
with everything but joy.

You really want to
give up on this?

1271

a lot of time in Kenya

Yeah, yeah, good peeps.

1276
00:51:25.833 --> 00:51:27.375 line:83%
Green peeps, yeah.

1277
00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:29.916 line:83%
I'm interested in
what your experience was there,

1278
00:51:29.916 --> 00:51:31.875 line:83%
because, you know,
I've been reading up on them

1279
00:51:31.875 --> 00:51:35.000 line:83%
and they're a really
intriguing organization.

1280

Yeah, you know what?

1281

one of those cheese-puff trays.

-I'll show you where they are.
-Right, but before you do,

1283
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:42.291 line:83%
can you tell me about
Charlie Sennet?

1284
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:43.291 line:83%
Huh?

1285
00:51:43.291 --> 00:51:47.125 line:83%
Charlie Sennet, the journalist
who started Give Green

1286
00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:48.416 line:83%
and is still hands on.

1287
00:51:48.416 --> 00:51:50.625 line:83%
I mean,
did you get to meet him?

1288

What do you think
of his mission statement?

1289
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.833 line:83%
Is it tenable?

1290
00:51:53.833 --> 00:51:56.541 line:83%
Oh, yeah,
of course it's tenable.

1291
00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:57.833 line:83%
Elevenable, twelveable...

1292
00:51:57.833 --> 00:51:59.500 line:83%
I mean,
it's infinite really, right?

[Leona] Ha-ha.

1294
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.000 line:83%
I mean, I'm intrigued
by their policy

1295
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.833 line:83%
of direct charitable donations.

1296
00:52:03.833 --> 00:52:05.333 line:83%
You know, personally, I think

1297
00:52:05.333 --> 00:52:07.583 line:83%
donations need
to be conditional.

1298
00:52:07.583 --> 00:52:09.500 line:83%
What do you think?

1299
00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:11.333 line:83%
[Dean] Uh, you know what?

1300
00:52:11.333 --> 00:52:12.875 line:83%
It's group photo time.
Group photo time.

1301

Group photo! Come on,
let's make some memories!

1302
00:52:14.791 --> 00:52:15.833 line:83%
Yeah. Yeah.

1303
00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:17.958 line:83%
You have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you, Ricky?

1304
00:52:17.958 --> 00:52:20.375 line:83%
Maybe he just doesn't want
to talk shop at a bris, Leona.

1305
00:52:20.375 --> 00:52:22.916 line:83%
Or maybe he's a fraud.
Are you a fraud, sir?

1309
00:52:37.958 --> 00:52:38.958 line:83%
Yeah?

1310
00:52:38.958 --> 00:52:40.791 line:83%
The perception that
the program at Give Green

1311
00:52:40.791 --> 00:52:42.166 line:83%
needs to be conditional.

1312
00:52:42.166 --> 00:52:44.125 line:83%
They choose to offer
unconditional cash transfers

1313
00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:45.208 line:83%
for two reasons.

1314
00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:47.875 line:83%
First, empowering poor people
to make their own choices?

1315
00:52:47.875 --> 00:52:50.041 line:83%
Well, that advances
their core value of respect.

1316
00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:52.041 line:83%
Second, imposing
conditions requires

1317
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:54.458 line:83%
expensive monitoring
and enforcement structures

1318
00:52:54.458 --> 00:52:57.166 line:83%
that could raise administrative
costs as high as 63%.

1319
00:52:57.666 --> 00:52:59.750 line:83%
The existing empirical evidence
comparing the impact

1320
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:02.125 line:83%
of conditional
to unconditional cash transfers

1321
00:53:02.125 --> 00:53:03.875 line:83%
shows that these added costs

1322
00:53:03.875 --> 00:53:06.166 line:83%
simply do not
produce commensurate benefits.

1323
00:53:08.125 --> 00:53:10.458 line:83%
I wonder where those
cheese-puff trays went off to.

1422
00:56:33.916 --> 00:56:35.583 line:83%
[whispers] I'm so happy
we're doing this.

1423
00:56:36.166 --> 00:56:37.791 line:83%
Okay, this one's
for all the marbles.

1424
00:56:37.791 --> 00:56:39.916 line:83%
[JT] All right, Gary,

1434
00:57:24.416 --> 00:57:26.166 line:83%
Shouldn't we be stopping this?

1435
00:57:26.166 --> 00:57:29.083 line:83%
Don't worry, we got about
a half hour before it kicks in.

1436
00:57:31.958 --> 00:57:34.500 line:83%
Hey, I figured out
how I know him.

Is he drunk?

1456
00:58:30.958 --> 00:58:33.583 line:83%
[whispers] I don't know.
I saw him eat a peanut earlier.

1457
00:58:33.583 --> 00:58:35.083 line:83%
Maybe he's having a reaction?

1458
00:58:35.083 --> 00:58:36.833 line:83%
-Man, you said half an hour.
-I don't know.

1459
00:58:36.833 --> 00:58:38.583 line:83%
I think I might have
developed a tolerance.

1460
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.500 line:83%
Okay.

1461
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:44.708 line:83%

Yeah, he did.
But that was so long ago.

1484
00:59:28.958 --> 00:59:30.958 line:83%
Plus, it's got to be
way easier to circumcise

1485
00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:33.166 line:83%
a gorgeous African penis
than a baby penis.

1486
00:59:33.166 --> 00:59:34.791 line:83%
You would think.

1487
00:59:34.791 --> 00:59:36.166 line:83%
I can do it.

1488
00:59:37.625 --> 00:59:40.875 line:83%

I'm sure I can pull it off.
Pun intended.

1492

-Right.
-I'll just look one up on Yelp.

No, we already have a mohel.
He's already said the tefilah.

1496
00:59:59.208 --> 01:00:01.708 line:83%
We just need to
let Ricky finish it off.

1497
01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:03.750 line:83%
Mom, no, I'm going to
take him to a hospital,

1498

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:17.958 line:83%
Rod! Listen to me, okay?

1696
01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:21.625 line:83%
There's no way
that this ends well. All right?

1697
01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:23.958 line:83%
You don't even know
what we do here.

1698
01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:25.625 line:83%
It's like business stuff.

1699
01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.583 line:83%
You guys are like...
like bookies, right?

1700
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.916 line:83%
We're not bookies.

1701
01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:32.833 line:83%
Well, when you boil it down
a little bit, there is...

1702
01:07:32.833 --> 01:07:35.458 line:83%
It's way more complex
than that, okay?

1703
01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:38.916 line:83%
Dean, Erin's in your office.
She says it's urgent.

1704
01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:44.333 line:83%
Hey.

1705
01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:46.541 line:83%
They hired me!

1706
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:48.041 line:83%
-Who?
-MFMBC!

1707
01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:50.125 line:83%
They want me to produce
the 'Hero of the Week' segment.

1708
01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:52.375 line:83%
-MFMBC?
-Yes!

1709
01:07:52.375 --> 01:07:53.875 line:83%
Are you kidding me? What?!

1710
01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:56.833 line:83%
-Oh, my gosh! Oh.
-[Erin squeals and laughs]

1711
01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:59.041 line:83%
-Oh, I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you.

1712
01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.833 line:83%
Didn't I tell you you were
going to get your big break?

1713
01:08:00.833 --> 01:08:02.500 line:83%
-You did, you did.
-You got your big break.

1714
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.458 line:83%
You did. I pushed them
the Ricky Stanicky story

1715
01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:05.916 line:83%
and they loved it.

1716
01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:07.625 line:83%
The Ricky what?

1717
01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.125 line:83%
The 'Hero of the Week' segment.

1718
01:08:09.125 --> 01:08:11.125 line:83%
I sent them a proposal
about the work Ricky does

1719
01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:13.416 line:83%
in Africa, in South America
and how he works with Bono...

1720
01:08:13.416 --> 01:08:15.333 line:83%
[audio distorts] ...and helped
clean up the oil spill

1721
01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:18.125 line:83%
in the Chesapeake Bay,
and they want me to produce it!

1722
01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.958 line:83%
-Oh!
-"Oh"?

1723
01:08:21.666 --> 01:08:23.041 line:83%
What's wrong with your face?

1724
01:08:23.041 --> 01:08:26.666 line:83%
This is my happy face.
I'm so... I'm happy.

1725
01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:28.875 line:83%
I'm ha... I'm happy.
[coughing]

1726
01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:31.541 line:83%
Great. Because we got to
get him back here now.

1727
01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:33.458 line:83%
They want me
to run it this week.

1728
01:08:33.458 --> 01:08:34.791 line:83%
Right.

1729
01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:38.291 line:83%
I don't know if that's
going to be... possible.

1730
01:08:38.291 --> 01:08:40.541 line:83%
I don't...
There's just a lot of, uh...

1731
01:08:40.541 --> 01:08:42.708 line:83%
-[Ricky] More of a canned ham.
-A lot of moving...

1732
01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:44.333 line:83%
-Very close to spam.
-[Erin] Ricky?

1733
01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:45.583 line:83%
Ricky!

1734
01:08:46.708 --> 01:08:47.833 line:83%
Ricky!

1735
01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:50.958 line:83%
Man of the Year?
Wow! That's so cool!

1736
01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:53.041 line:83%
It's not man of the year.
It's hero of the week.

1737
01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:55.500 line:83%
And it's not wow.
It's a fucking shit show.

1738
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.541 line:83%
And on top of that,

1739
01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:58.375 line:83%
the girls are going bowling
with him tonight.

1740
01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:00.541 line:83%
-Do we have to go?
-Of course we have to go.

1741
01:09:00.541 --> 01:09:03.333 line:83%
We're the dipshit's
best friends, remember?

1742
01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:06.083 line:83%
Plus we can't let that fucker
out of our sight.

1743
01:09:06.083 --> 01:09:07.583 line:83%
There's no telling
what he'll say.

1744
01:09:07.583 --> 01:09:11.583 line:83%
You know, on the bright side,
it is pretty remarkable that,

1745
01:09:11.583 --> 01:09:14.791 line:83%
you know, we invented a man
who can win an award like this.

1746
01:09:14.791 --> 01:09:16.083 line:83%
Hey, you think he'll thank us?

1747
01:09:16.083 --> 01:09:18.750 line:83%
Are you fucking serious
right now?

1748
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:21.250 line:83%
Wes! You are smoking
way too much weed

1749
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:23.791 line:83%
if you don't understand
how serious this is, okay?

1750
01:09:23.791 --> 01:09:25.916 line:83%
It's not just about us anymore.

1751
01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:30.000 line:83%
This could destroy
Erin's career. Wake up!

1752
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.000 line:83%
I don't have a choice.

1753
01:09:35.666 --> 01:09:37.500 line:83%
-I got to tell her the truth.
-No fucking way!

1754
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.250 line:83%
-I got to.
-Dean, no. Dude!

1755
01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:42.041 line:83%
If you tell Erin,
she'll tell Susan. Okay?

1756
01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:43.666 line:83%
Then what do you think
is going to happen?

1757
01:09:43.666 --> 01:09:45.166 line:83%
Not only did I miss
the birth of my son,

1758
01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:47.083 line:83%
but I let some porno
Peter Frampton impersonator

1759
01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:48.875 line:83%
snip his dick
with a cigar cutter.

1760
01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:50.208 line:83%
No!

1761
01:09:52.416 --> 01:09:53.500 line:83%
Hey, guys.

1762
01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:55.583 line:83%
Hey, Karnowski.

1763
01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:57.250 line:83%
How was the Rebillet show?

1764
01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:59.958 line:83%
It was great, you piece of
shit. Thanks for the tickets.

1765
01:09:59.958 --> 01:10:01.416 line:83%
Thank you!

1766
01:10:03.583 --> 01:10:05.291 line:83%
Shitbag!

1767
01:10:07.458 --> 01:10:09.166 line:83%
He doesn't deserve that.
Karnowsk!

1768
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:12.208 line:83%
Karnowski!

[Rod] You'll never pick it up.

1771
01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:26.666 line:83%
I like your form.

1772
01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:32.416 line:83%
I mean, look at this guy.
Not a care in the world.

1773
01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:34.416 line:83%
If he mentions his salary
one more time,

1774
01:10:34.416 --> 01:10:36.166 line:83%
I'm going to hit him
in the fucking head.

1775
01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:37.750 line:83%
Well, maybe if you gave him
more money

1776
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.416 line:83%
than he's being paid,
he'd leave.

1777
01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:41.958 line:83%
He's getting paid $250,000,
Wes.

1778
01:10:41.958 --> 01:10:43.458 line:83%
Yeah, but that's
for the whole year.

1779
01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:44.791 line:83%
I'll just run to my bank, then.

1780
01:10:44.791 --> 01:10:47.541 line:83%
We got to figure out a way to
get rid of him or we're done.

1781
01:10:47.541 --> 01:10:49.458 line:83%
Look, maybe you're worried
about nothing, right?

1782
01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:51.583 line:83%
She only has a couple of days
to dig up dirt.

1783
01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:54.083 line:83%
If she doesn't dig up dirt,
that's worse.

1784
01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.125 line:83%
Eventually someone's
going to find out the truth.

1785
01:10:56.125 --> 01:10:58.208 line:83%
And then Erin would just
be one of those journalists

1786
01:10:58.208 --> 01:11:00.041 line:83%
that makes up fake stories.

1787
01:11:00.041 --> 01:11:02.375 line:83%
Yeah, like Mario Lopez.

1788
01:11:03.416 --> 01:11:04.541 line:83%
Oh.

1789
01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:07.083 line:83%
Well,
look who's hitting it off.

1790
01:11:07.708 --> 01:11:10.291 line:83%
I thought she was
with Gary Polisner.

1791
01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:12.208 line:83%
Apparently not.

1792
01:11:12.208 --> 01:11:14.583 line:83%
Hey, look,
none of my business,

1793
01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:17.375 line:83%
but you should think about
chopping that off.

1794
01:11:17.958 --> 01:11:19.916 line:83%
What? A haircut?

1795
01:11:19.916 --> 01:11:23.541 line:83%
No, I don't know,
I mean, I'd be afraid to.

1796
01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:26.541 line:83%
Why? With a face like yours,
you should have a pixie.

1797
01:11:26.541 --> 01:11:28.583 line:83%
-Really?
-Yes! Look at this.

1798
01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:31.208 line:83%
Okay...

1799
01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:34.166 line:83%
Maybe not.

1800
01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:36.875 line:83%
Down to the shoulders,
maybe mid back.

1801
01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:39.750 line:83%
Yeah, I mean, yeah...

1802
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:43.083 line:83%
Honestly, I've kind of been
wanting to cut it for a while,

1803
01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:45.458 line:83%
but I just feel like
this is like my thing now,

1804
01:11:45.458 --> 01:11:47.083 line:83%
and everyone says
that they love it.

1805
01:11:47.083 --> 01:11:48.541 line:83%
They're just being nice.

1806
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.666 line:83%
What, really?

1807
01:11:51.666 --> 01:11:53.166 line:83%
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

1808
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:57.958 line:83%
But why would they lie to me?

1809
01:11:57.958 --> 01:12:01.541 line:83%
I don't know.
People are weird, right?

1810
01:12:02.166 --> 01:12:03.750 line:83%
Maybe it's hard for them
to tell you

1811
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.916 line:83%
you look like a freaking loon.
[chuckles]

1812

Hey, Carly, whoa.

1813
01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:16.125 line:83%
Look, I love your hair.
All right?

1814
01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:17.541 line:83%
What I was trying to say was,

1815
01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:19.250 line:83%
if you want to cut it,
you should.

1816
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:21.541 line:83%
You shouldn't care about
what anybody else thinks.

1817
01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:23.666 line:83%
Look at you.

1818
01:12:23.666 --> 01:12:27.083 line:83%
You're smart, you're sweet.

1819

You got that cute

01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:49.958 line:83%
and we're an old-money
New England company.

1847
01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:52.750 line:83%
They think we're dinosaurs.

1848
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:54.333 line:83%
They're looking for new,

1849
01:13:54.333 --> 01:13:56.708 line:83%
they're looking
for progressive.

1850
01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:59.791 line:83%
So, come on. [claps]
Let's hear some ideas.

1851
01:13:59.791 --> 01:14:02.833 line:83%
Dean, you're point on this.
Why don't you get us started?

1852
01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:04.333 line:83%
Actually,
I was thinking that Ricky

1853
01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:06.083 line:83%
should take point on this
today.

1854
01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:08.750 line:83%
He's our newest employee
and he's an 'eco-hero'.

1855
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:11.541 line:83%
I like that idea.
Ricky, what do you got?

1856
01:14:12.166 --> 01:14:14.416 line:83%
Well, thank you for
the vote of confidence, Dean.

1857
01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:15.958 line:83%
You should run the meeting,
for sure.

1858
01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:17.875 line:83%
I am just
not quite up to speed.

1859
01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:18.916 line:83%
Well, that makes sense.

1860
01:14:18.916 --> 01:14:20.791 line:83%
But Ricky's got something
big worked out here.

1861
01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:23.916 line:83%
What'd you call it?
Um... game changer, right?

1862
01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:28.166 line:83%
Game changer. Got to love that.
Ricky, what do you got?

1863
01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:29.708 line:83%
I, um...

1864
01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:31.000 line:83%
I, er...

1865
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000 line:83%
Rick, I have a lunch
in 23 minutes.

1866
01:14:36.541 --> 01:14:38.125 line:83%
Yeah.

1867
01:14:40.958 --> 01:14:42.708 line:83%
Okay. [clears throat]

1868
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.916 line:83%
Um...

1869
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:49.083 line:83%
My area of expertize is in
non-profit humanitarian work.

1870
01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:51.041 line:83%
In short, I'm a world hugger.

1871
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:54.583 line:83%
So, you know, why don't we
bring my exciting background

1872
01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:57.708 line:83%
to the boring-ass world
of investment products?

1873
01:14:57.708 --> 01:15:00.041 line:83%
I mean, you know,
ladies and gentlemen,

1874
01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:03.000 line:83%
does for-profit
have to be for profit?

1875
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.458 line:83%
Well, that's the general idea.

1876
01:15:06.958 --> 01:15:08.041 line:83%
Correct!

1877
01:15:08.041 --> 01:15:10.500 line:83%
Ten points to the gentleman
in the conservative grey suit.

1878
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000 line:83%
Er, could you please elaborate?

1879
01:15:20.791 --> 01:15:22.291 line:83%
What I was saying...

1880
01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:25.166 line:83%
..was, what if we took
all the money we made

1881
01:15:25.166 --> 01:15:28.375 line:83%
and gave it away to poor people
and shit?

1882
01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:32.750 line:83%
I'm not sure I understand that.

1883
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:35.625 line:83%
-And shit.
-I know I don't.

1884
01:15:35.625 --> 01:15:38.083 line:83%
Well, think about it.

1885
01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:41.500 line:83%
If we became, um, like
the Paul-Newman-salad-dressing

1886
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.166 line:83%
of banks,

1887
01:15:43.166 --> 01:15:45.333 line:83%
the whole world would like us.

1888
01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:48.416 line:83%
That is the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.

1889
01:15:48.416 --> 01:15:49.958 line:83%
[executives snickering]

1890
01:15:49.958 --> 01:15:51.958 line:83%
[Summerhayes]
Well, now, wait a minute.

1891
01:15:51.958 --> 01:15:53.791 line:83%
Read between the lines,
Billings.

1892
01:15:53.791 --> 01:15:56.541 line:83%
This is exactly what
I've been talking about.

1893
01:15:56.541 --> 01:15:59.708 line:83%
Stanicky's saying
we got to shake things up.

1894
01:15:59.708 --> 01:16:00.916 line:83%
Try something different.

1895
01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:02.791 line:83%
No, that's not what
he's saying. He's saying...

1896
01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:04.666 line:83%
What about that
Tom's company?

1897
01:16:04.666 --> 01:16:08.458 line:83%
Giving away a free pair
of shoes for every pair sold.

1898
01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:11.125 line:83%
I bet that sounded like
a stupid idea at first.

1899
01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:13.000 line:83%
And what are they clearing?

1900
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.208 line:83%
170 million in revenue
last year.

1901
01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:19.208 line:83%
170 million. That's impressive.

1902
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000 line:83%
Now, obviously, we can't
give away all our money,

1903
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.750 line:83%
but we could funnel some of it
into philanthropic ventures.

1904
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:29.375 line:83%
And there have got to be
tax incentives.

1905
01:16:29.375 --> 01:16:32.541 line:83%
-Yeah! Tax shit.
-Yeah.

1906
01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:34.958 line:83%
We could call it, um...
Feel-Good Investing.

1907
01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:37.083 line:83%
We'll show people
we're a company that cares.

1908
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.833 line:83%
Feel-Good Investing.
I like that. Great work, Rick.

1909
01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:44.666 line:83%
Thanks, Ted.

1910
01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:46.541 line:83%
[mouths silently]

1911
01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:48.791 line:83%
What did you say, Ricky?

1912
01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:52.125 line:83%
Oh... nothing.

1913
01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:54.875 line:83%
I was just saying
"fuck you" to that guy.

1914
01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:00.208 line:83%
Yeah, fuck you, Billings!

1915
01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:02.250 line:83%
[laughs]

1916
01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:05.291 line:83%
[executives chuckling]

1917
01:17:06.166 --> 01:17:07.916 line:83%
We're just kidding.

1918
01:17:07.916 --> 01:17:09.291 line:83%
But fuck you, Billings.

1919
01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.125 line:83%
[laughter]

1920
01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.916 line:83%
Here's what we're going to do.

1921
01:17:13.916 --> 01:17:16.375 line:83%
The World River folks are
flying in Wednesday afternoon.

1922
01:17:16.375 --> 01:17:18.333 line:83%
Wednesday? What?
Why Wednesday?

1923
01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.500 line:83%
Because Wednesday night

1924
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.583 line:83%
we're going to have
a little summit over at my club

1925
01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:24.166 line:83%
and watch Ricky's
'Hero of the Week' segment.

1926
01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:25.583 line:83%
Clubs ahoy!

1927
01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:28.083 line:83%
Right.

1928
01:17:28.083 --> 01:17:31.041 line:83%
Now, I want you to bring
your families and your A-games.

1929
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:33.666 line:83%
Wednesday, we're going to show
these people who we are.

1930
01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:36.666 line:83%
We're modern, we're fun,
we're socially conscious,

1931
01:17:36.666 --> 01:17:39.625 line:83%
and we're American heroes.

1932
01:17:41.916 --> 01:17:43.583 line:83%
-What is happening right now?
-I don't know.

1933
01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:45.750 line:83%
I feel like Jason Bateman
in every episode of 'Ozark'.

1934
01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:48.958 line:83%
Hey, boss-man?
Er, got a minute?

1935
01:17:48.958 --> 01:17:50.458 line:83%
Sure!

1936
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:57.166 line:83%
Dean! JT! What it do?

1937
01:17:57.166 --> 01:17:59.541 line:83%
What the...?
What are you doing here?

1938
01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.000 line:83%
Ricky hired me.

1939
01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:03.583 line:83%
-To do what?
-I don't know.

1940
01:18:03.583 --> 01:18:05.125 line:83%
Help him out with stuff,
I guess.

1941
01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:07.166 line:83%
Yes, I think young Wesley
shows great promise

1942
01:18:07.166 --> 01:18:08.375 line:83%
as my attaché.

1943
01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:10.458 line:83%
-Who's your attaché, Dean?
-I don't have an attaché.

1944
01:18:10.458 --> 01:18:11.708 line:83%
I'm not a foreign diplomat.

1945
01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:14.000 line:83%
Listen, you and me
need to have a chat.

1946
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.125 line:83%
Okay, but before we do,
I want to show you something.

1947
01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.208 line:83%
[exasperated sigh]

1948
01:18:21.416 --> 01:18:23.833 line:83%
First, thank you
for having faith

1949
01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.375 line:83%
and believing in me today.

1950
01:18:25.375 --> 01:18:27.458 line:83%
I never would've come up with
those ideas in the meeting

1951
01:18:27.458 --> 01:18:28.875 line:83%
if you hadn't thrown me
into the fire.

1952
01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:30.166 line:83%
Happy to do it, man.

1953
01:18:30.166 --> 01:18:32.583 line:83%
I think I figured out
what the problem is.

1954
01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:34.708 line:83%
What problem?

1955
01:18:34.708 --> 01:18:37.208 line:83%
The whole 'not getting
the merger' thingy problem.

1956
01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:38.458 line:83%
You went to one staff meeting

1957
01:18:38.458 --> 01:18:40.125 line:83%
and you've got
the whole company figured out?

1958
01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:42.708 line:83%
So I filmed this on my phone in
the staff meeting this morning

1959
01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:44.250 line:83%
and my attaché
put it on the computer.

1960
01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:46.083 line:83%
So, check it out.

1961
01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:48.708 line:83%
-...San Francisco and we...
-[Rod] See?

1962
01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:50.791 line:83%
-...old-money New England...
-You see?

1963
01:18:50.791 --> 01:18:53.541 line:83%
-They're looking for...
-See what?

1964
01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:55.500 line:83%
The guy's
a world-class air-dicker.

1965
01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.666 line:83%
An air what-er?
What are you talking about?

1966
01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.208 line:83%
Keep watching.

1967
01:18:59.208 --> 01:19:00.833 line:83%
Every time
he tries to make a point,

1968
01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:03.583 line:83%
it's like he puts an
invisible penis in his mouth.

1969
01:19:03.583 --> 01:19:05.750 line:83%
Remember when Obama
used to power knuckle

1970
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:06.875 line:83%
to try to make that point?

1971
01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.541 line:83%
Well, Summerhayes
does the same thing,

1972
01:19:08.541 --> 01:19:10.625 line:83%
but when he does it, it's like
he's smoking invisible dongs.

1973
01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:13.708 line:83%
Oh, my God,
he is an air-dicker.

1974
01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.083 line:83%
There's a time
and a place for it,

1975
01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.708 line:83%
but it's really hard
to get away with it

1976
01:19:16.708 --> 01:19:18.000 line:83%
in a business setting.

1977
01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:21.375 line:83%
Yo, let's make
a TikTok out of this!

1978
01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:22.791 line:83%
[Rod chuckles]

1979
01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:25.625 line:83%
What do you guys think?
Should I tell him?

1980
01:19:25.625 --> 01:19:27.166 line:83%
Tell him what?

1981
01:19:27.666 --> 01:19:29.666 line:83%
That he's a world-class
air-dicker.

1982
01:19:32.291 --> 01:19:34.375 line:83%
-Absolutely.
-Yeah, you should.

[quirky music]

1984
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.500 line:83%
How could you work for him,
dude?

1985
01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.208 line:83%
We don't need you
exploring career opportunities

1986
01:19:50.208 --> 01:19:51.625 line:83%
when he's trying
to ruin our lives.

1987
01:19:51.625 --> 01:19:53.458 line:83%
First of all,
he's not ruining my life.

1988
01:19:53.458 --> 01:19:55.458 line:83%
He hired me 'cause
he actually gives a shit.

1989
01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.125 line:83%
If I didn't get off my ass
and get a job,

1990
01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:58.625 line:83%
Keith was going to dump me.

1991
01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:00.625 line:83%
By the way, I noticed that
my so-called real friends

1992
01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:02.000 line:83%
never offered me a job.

1993
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.500 line:83%
[Summerhayes yelling]
Are you fucking shitting me?!

1994
01:20:08.666 --> 01:20:10.291 line:83%
You two!

1995
01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:12.291 line:83%
In here, now!

1996
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.625 line:83%
Come in, sit down.

1997
01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:25.041 line:83%
Show them what you showed me.

1998
