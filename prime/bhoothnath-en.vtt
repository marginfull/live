It's so dark in here.

6
00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:00.923 line:82%
What's the matter?

7
00:01:01.764 --> 00:01:03.122 line:82%
It's so dark in here.

8
00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:05.443 line:82%
Switch on the light then.

9
00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:08.443 line:82%
- Where's the switch?
- I don't know. I'm very scared.

10
00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:09.903 line:82%
Here it is.

11
00:01:13.104 --> 00:01:14.142 line:82%
Wow.

12
00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:22.103 line:82%
This place is so cool.

13
00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:24.442 line:82%
Isn't it? Okay, tell me.

14
00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.803 line:82%
Would you find any place
as romantic as this in Goa?

15
00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:28.583 line:82%
No one will ever know.

16
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.803 line:82%
By the way, Rohan,
whom does this house belong to?

17
00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:42.123 line:82%
It's really so interesting.

18
00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:46.402 line:82%
This big, empty house has
just me, you and a ghost.

19
00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:54.763 line:82%
Have you brought
something to eat or not?

20
00:01:54.827 --> 00:01:57.226 line:82%
Of course, I have. And you
know what I've arranged for?

21
00:01:57.443 --> 00:01:59.443 line:82%
A candlelight dinner.
That too, with champagne.

22
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:01.761 line:82%
Perfect. Then get it ready.

23
00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:03.843 line:82%
- I'll go freshen up quickly.
- Okay. I'll come along.

24
00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:07.402 line:82%
I'll go and freshen up.
You get the dinner ready.

25
00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.289 line:82%
- Tina... Tina.
- Bye.

26
00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:17.563 line:82%
You're still here?

27
00:02:21.364 --> 00:02:23.643 line:82%
Please, let's go downstairs.
I'm starving.

28
00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:26.323 line:82%
Tina, dinner is ready.

29
00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:40.963 line:82%
- What? - But you were just
standing there, ain't you?

30
00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:42.922 line:82%
What? Why would I stand there?

31
00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:44.842 line:82%
I was downstairs
getting the dinner ready.

32
00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:46.402 line:82%
Come on. Let me show
you what I've made.

33
00:02:46.523 --> 00:02:47.563 line:82%
Then who was that?

34
00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:49.443 line:82%
Oh, I get it.

35
00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:52.522 line:82%
Now, you're trying to scare me.
Wait.

36
00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:55.323 line:82%
I got scared. How cute you are!

37
00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:56.722 line:82%
Come on, let me show
you what I've made.

38
00:02:56.963 --> 00:02:59.482 line:82%
I've made an excellent dinner.
And I've lit some candles, too.

39
00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:01.402 line:82%
Look. See how
beautiful it looks. Come here.

40
00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:04.143 line:82%
Hey, hey. Honey, our
candle will blow out.

41
00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:07.182 line:82%
Please, close the window.
Close the window.

42
00:03:08.912 --> 00:03:09.951 line:82%
Quickly.

43
00:03:10.263 --> 00:03:12.062 line:82%
Hold it.

44
00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:17.705 line:82%
Rohan, there's someone over there.

45
00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:19.783 line:82%
Tina, enough.
That's quite enough now.

46
00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:21.343 line:82%
I just saw someone. Please,
let's leave.

47
00:03:21.423 --> 00:03:22.583 line:82%
You're just imagining things.

48
00:03:24.464 --> 00:03:26.342 line:82%
Now why are you screaming?
It's just a power cut.

49
00:03:27.384 --> 00:03:28.423 line:82%
The TV is on.

50
00:03:28.503 --> 00:03:30.343 line:82%
Tina, there's no electricity.
How can the TV work?

51
00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:31.982 line:82%
Rohan, I'm telling you.
There's someone here.

52
00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:33.223 line:82%
- Please. Listen to me. Let's leave.
- Tina. Enough.

53
00:03:33.303 --> 00:03:35.023 line:82%
Tina, stop it. Stop it.
You're ruining the evening.

54
00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:36.703 line:82%
Stop it. Wait here.

55
00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:39.383 line:82%
Rohan, please
believe me. I'm not lying.

56
00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:41.063 line:82%
- Let's see now.
- I've seen something. Please.

57
00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:42.662 line:82%
Is anyone here?

58
00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:43.783 line:82%
- Stop it, Rohan.
- Is anyone there?

59
00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:45.062 line:82%
- There is.
- Did you see anyone?

60
00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:48.343 line:82%
Look here. Look here, too. Tina,
there's no one here.

61
00:05:58.503 --> 00:06:00.023 line:82%
Give me the keys.

62
00:06:00.744 --> 00:06:03.143 line:82%
Hey, Antony, get up.
Get out of here. Go.

63
00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:05.222 line:82%
Hey, let me stay here.
I'll take care of it.

64
00:06:05.703 --> 00:06:06.743 line:82%
You can't take care of yourself,
but you'd like...

65
00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:07.862 line:82%
to take care of this house?

66
00:06:07.944 --> 00:06:09.422 line:82%
Come on, get up. Get out of here.

67
00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:11.903 line:82%
Hey. This is my house.

68
00:06:12.744 --> 00:06:15.623 line:82%
No one apart from me
would dare to stay here.

69
00:06:16.263 --> 00:06:17.543 line:82%
A ghost lives here.

70
00:06:18.543 --> 00:06:21.623 line:82%
Hey, Jagan. Tell me,
who will stay here?

71
00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:30.542 line:82%
Come on, come on. See,
Banku. This... All this is Goa.

72
00:06:30.903 --> 00:06:33.103 line:82%
- Wow.
- Where's our house?

73
00:06:33.303 --> 00:06:35.543 line:82%
Our house... That's our house.

74
00:06:35.784 --> 00:06:37.543 line:82%
- That isn't our house.
- Hey.

75
00:06:37.623 --> 00:06:40.262 line:82%
- Stop it. Stop it. You talk rubbish.
- Hey, how would you know?

76
00:06:40.344 --> 00:06:41.702 line:82%
You were sleeping when we
came here to house-hunt.

77
00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:43.303 line:82%
- Really?
- Yes, like always.

78
00:06:43.383 --> 00:06:44.663 line:82%
- Okay. Now, let's go.
- Listen, just a minute. Listen...

79
00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:47.822 line:82%
- Let me just show him. Hey.
- Come on.

80
00:06:47.943 --> 00:06:48.983 line:82%
Okay, come on.

81
00:06:56.343 --> 00:06:58.583 line:82%
Come, come. Pick my taxi, sir.

82
00:06:58.664 --> 00:07:00.023 line:82%
- Come, come. Sir...
- Sir.

83
00:07:00.224 --> 00:07:01.543 line:82%
Let go off my suitcase at least.

84
00:07:01.623 --> 00:07:03.943 line:82%
Hey, just a moment. What are
you doing? Aditya, tell them.

85
00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.663 line:82%
We don't want to go sightseeing.
Wait. Tell them.

86
00:07:05.984 --> 00:07:07.622 line:82%
Tell them the name of the road.
Tell them the address quickly.

87
00:07:07.704 --> 00:07:09.223 line:82%
- Don't... Don't you remember?
Wait a minute. - Hey, stop.

88
00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:11.743 line:82%
- Nath Villa.
- Nath... You can take them.

89
00:07:11.823 --> 00:07:14.303 line:82%
- What happened? Hey, brother... brother...
- What happened?

90
00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:17.063 line:82%
- What happened?
- They were just fighting to take us.

91
00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:18.182 line:82%
What's the matter now?

92
00:07:18.423 --> 00:07:20.942 line:82%
Madam, no one is
going to take you there.

93
00:07:21.303 --> 00:07:24.143 line:82%
- Sir, no one will take you there.
- Why?

94
00:07:24.663 --> 00:07:26.783 line:82%
I'd advise you not to go there either.

95
00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:29.023 line:82%
Don't go if you don't want to.
We'll hire another taxi. Come, Banku.

96
00:07:29.103 --> 00:07:31.223 line:82%
Listen, sir. I'll take you
there if you want. Come.

97
00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:33.662 line:82%
- Take that.
- Come.

98
00:07:33.783 --> 00:07:34.823 line:82%
And hold this.

99
00:07:35.144 --> 00:07:36.263 line:82%
Come, kid.

100
00:07:40.424 --> 00:07:43.223 line:82%
"Chin... Chinchpokli."

101
00:07:43.304 --> 00:07:45.623 line:82%
"The bus stops when the
conductor rings the bell."

102
00:07:45.704 --> 00:07:46.742 line:82%
You sing well.

103
00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:49.703 line:82%
By the way, why didn't the other
taxis want to go to Nath Villa?

104
00:07:50.064 --> 00:07:52.262 line:82%
Sir, may I ask you
something if you don't mind?

105
00:07:52.383 --> 00:07:54.062 line:82%
Are you related to Mr. Nath?

106
00:07:54.504 --> 00:07:56.102 line:82%
No, No, we rented that house.

107
00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:57.623 line:82%
Then rent another house instead.

108
00:07:57.704 --> 00:07:59.222 line:82%
Why are you asking for trouble, sir?

109
00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.502 line:82%
Why? What's wrong with that place?

110
00:08:01.623 --> 00:08:04.742 line:82%
Ma'am, it's said that
there's an angry spirit there.

111
00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:07.103 line:82%
There's a ghost there. Ghost.

112
00:08:10.664 --> 00:08:12.983 line:82%
Hey, there are no such
things as ghosts. Nonsense.

113
00:08:19.104 --> 00:08:21.902 line:82%
- Hey. - Just a mention of the
ghost and the car...

114
00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:24.782 line:82%
- What happened?
- Just a moment.

115
00:08:26.823 --> 00:08:28.343 line:82%
I think the car won't
go any further, sir.

116
00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:30.463 line:82%
So? Will we have to walk?

117
00:08:30.584 --> 00:08:33.302 line:82%
- Yes, you'll have to walk from here.
- No.

118
00:08:33.384 --> 00:08:34.823 line:82%
It's very close. Come,
Banku. Let's carry your mommy...

119
00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:36.542 line:82%
- and take her along.
- Oh, no.

120
00:08:37.944 --> 00:08:40.142 line:82%
Here's Nath Villa.

121
00:08:41.624 --> 00:08:43.022 line:82%
You're Mr. Aditya, right?

122
00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:45.023 line:82%
I'm Jagan. I'm the caretaker here.

123
00:08:45.103 --> 00:08:48.303 line:82%
Take this. Take it.
Good. Here's the suitcase.

124
00:08:48.363 --> 00:08:49.523 line:82%
- Hello.
- Hello.

125
00:08:49.604 --> 00:08:51.242 line:82%
Come.

126
00:08:51.723 --> 00:08:53.882 line:82%
- Come.
- Hey. Get down, you monkey.

127
00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:55.063 line:82%
- Come on.
- Come on, Banku.

128
00:08:55.544 --> 00:08:56.583 line:82%
Come.

129
00:08:59.704 --> 00:09:02.563 line:82%
Such a big house. This is even
bigger than grandpa's house.

130
00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:05.964 line:82%
- Isn't it? - Come, I'll show you the
inside of the house. Come.

131
00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:25.662 line:82%
It's jammed.

132
00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:27.623 line:82%
How long has it been locked?

133
00:09:28.384 --> 00:09:30.623 line:82%
Not for long. I just got it cleaned.

134
00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:31.905 line:82%
As soon as I learned
you would be arriving...

135
00:09:31.944 --> 00:09:32.982 line:82%
I got it cleaned. First-class.

136
00:09:33.935 --> 00:09:36.733 line:82%
This is well-cleaned?

137
00:09:37.037 --> 00:09:41.397 line:82%
It's clean. Anyway, you'll handle
the rest of the cleanup. Right?

138
00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.642 line:82%
I think we'll have to
break the glass. Hey.

139
00:09:54.524 --> 00:09:56.242 line:82%
Banku, what are you doing?

140
00:09:56.723 --> 00:09:57.763 line:82%
Just what he said.

141
00:09:58.684 --> 00:09:59.722 line:82%
But...

142
00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.923 line:82%
No problem.
We'll install another one.

143
00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:03.922 line:82%
- So I'll break it completely then.
- Good idea.

144
00:10:08.723 --> 00:10:10.363 line:82%
Hey, I was just...

145
00:10:10.584 --> 00:10:12.583 line:82%
I wonder how I'll
handle all this by myself.

146
00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:15.383 line:82%
Hey, now that it's broken, open
the window and then open the door.

147
00:10:17.223 --> 00:10:20.263 line:82%
- Come. I'll get it.
- Yes, get the luggage.

148
00:10:20.504 --> 00:10:21.743 line:82%
Such a big house.

149
00:10:22.263 --> 00:10:25.142 line:82%
- Oh, my God. Such a big house.
- Great.

150
00:10:25.623 --> 00:10:27.863 line:82%
People used to build such
lavish houses in the old times.

151
00:10:28.263 --> 00:10:29.503 line:82%
Your company is just too much.

152
00:10:29.784 --> 00:10:32.423 line:82%
- Couldn't they find us a medium
sized house? - Anjali. Now...

153
00:10:32.504 --> 00:10:34.663 line:82%
Ma'am, there's also a terrace upstairs.

154
00:10:34.743 --> 00:10:35.783 line:82%
- Oh, wow. There's a terrace, too.
- What?

155
00:10:35.864 --> 00:10:37.262 line:82%
- Yes.
- No... Banku.

156
00:10:37.344 --> 00:10:39.302 line:82%
Those are the stairs,
Banku. You'll fall down...

157
00:10:41.024 --> 00:10:43.463 line:82%
Okay. Ma'am, you'll get
water 24 hours a day here.

158
00:10:43.544 --> 00:10:45.823 line:82%
You can wash clothes and
utensils whenever you want.

159
00:10:45.944 --> 00:10:48.023 line:82%
Hey, she needs just an hour
for the clothes and utensils.

160
00:10:48.104 --> 00:10:49.262 line:82%
Anjali does everything very fast.

161
00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:51.662 line:82%
- Yes. So come. I'll show you the kitchen.
- You're too much, Aditya.

162
00:10:51.744 --> 00:10:54.263 line:82%
- Go see the kitchen. Go on.
- Come.

163
00:10:55.544 --> 00:10:56.903 line:82%
- This one, right?
- Right ahead. Yes.

164
00:10:59.984 --> 00:11:01.022 line:82%
Here, sir.

165
00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:04.382 line:82%
Listen, I wanted to ask you something.

166
00:11:06.504 --> 00:11:09.062 line:82%
There are a lot of rumors
going around about this house.

167
00:11:09.384 --> 00:11:14.783 line:82%
Even the cabbie was saying
that there are ghosts here.

168
00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:16.543 line:82%
That's all nonsense, sir.

169
00:11:17.103 --> 00:11:20.543 line:82%
Look, actually, the owner of
this house stays in the US.

170
00:11:20.664 --> 00:11:23.102 line:82%
I have the responsibility of
this house, so they're jealous.

171
00:11:23.223 --> 00:11:24.662 line:82%
They just spread false stories.

172
00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:28.262 line:82%
Trust me, sir. It's
nothing like that. Sign here.

173
00:11:28.424 --> 00:11:29.462 line:82%
Mama.

174
00:11:31.263 --> 00:11:33.383 line:82%
- Banku.
- Mama.

175
00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:35.623 line:82%
- What happened? Banku.
- Calm down, Anjali.

176
00:11:36.984 --> 00:11:38.942 line:82%
- Mama.
- Banku.

177
00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:40.502 line:82%
- What happened, Banku?
- What happened?

178
00:11:40.623 --> 00:11:41.863 line:82%
It's such a huge terrace.

179
00:11:41.943 --> 00:11:44.303 line:82%
It'll be so much fun
to play cricket here.

180
00:11:44.424 --> 00:11:47.783 line:82%
- So why were you screaming for that?
- Look how scared your mama got.

181
00:11:47.943 --> 00:11:50.983 line:82%
- I... I wasn't scared, but...
- But I got scared.

182
00:11:52.664 --> 00:11:54.943 line:82%
- You have a very naughty kid.
- He's too much.

183
00:11:55.064 --> 00:11:58.423 line:82%
- Come, let's go downstairs, Son.
- Come on, bowl to me.

184
00:11:59.223 --> 00:12:01.943 line:82%
- Come on.
- Let's go downstairs now.

185
00:12:02.064 --> 00:12:03.990 line:82%
Kids are bound to be mischievous,
Mr. Jagan.

186
00:12:04.177 --> 00:12:06.038 line:82%
By the way, how many kids
do you have?

187
00:12:06.464 --> 00:12:08.582 line:82%
I have two daughters.
They are very tranquil.

188
00:12:09.344 --> 00:12:10.823 line:82%
It's for them that
I have to work hard outside...

189
00:12:10.904 --> 00:12:12.383 line:82%
- the house all day.
- Banku.

190
00:12:12.504 --> 00:12:14.582 line:82%
Yes, one has to stay out
of the house for work.

191
00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:16.110 line:82%
Look at me, I stay out for months.

192
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:17.521 line:82%
Months? What do you mean?

193
00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:19.282 line:82%
I'm the chief
engineer on a cruise ship.

194
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:22.363 line:82%
- I have to go where the cruise goes.
- Okay.

195
00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:24.163 line:82%
And he leaves us behind.

196
00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:28.123 line:82%
That's why I wanted a house where
I don't have to worry about them.

197
00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:29.242 line:82%
Where they are safe.

198
00:12:30.323 --> 00:12:31.762 line:82%
Yes, it's very safe here.

199
00:12:31.844 --> 00:12:34.653 line:82%
You don't have to worry
about anything here, but just...

200
00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:35.980 line:82%
Oh, yes. I forgot about this.

201
00:12:41.191 --> 00:12:43.991 line:82%
What? So what else
could have I made?

202
00:12:44.243 --> 00:12:46.443 line:82%
Nothing. Sandwiches
are our favorite.

203
00:12:46.643 --> 00:12:48.163 line:82%
That's why it's
sandwiches for breakfast...

204
00:12:48.244 --> 00:12:51.283 line:82%
sandwiches for lunch,
sandwiches for dinner.

205
00:12:51.364 --> 00:12:52.642 line:82%
Sandwich, sandwich. Witch.

206
00:12:53.204 --> 00:12:54.243 line:82%
Adi.

207
00:12:54.884 --> 00:12:55.923 line:82%
- Papa...
- Yes?

208
00:12:56.003 --> 00:12:58.162 line:82%
Will mommy give me
sandwiches in the lunchbox, too?

209
00:12:58.283 --> 00:12:59.763 line:82%
No, no. She'll make
instant noodles sometimes.

210
00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:02.044 line:82%
- I can hear everything.
- Good then.

211
00:13:03.744 --> 00:13:05.382 line:82%
Okay, when is your cruise leaving?

212
00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:07.203 line:82%
Two days from now.

213
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.549 line:82%
No. Not at all.

214
00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:11.253 line:82%
You can't go anywhere till
everything is set in this house.

215
00:13:11.318 --> 00:13:12.358 line:82%
Yes, Papa.

216
00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:14.003 line:82%
No, Son. I'll have to go.

217
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.190 line:82%
- I can't have these sandwiches anymore.
- Very funny.

218
00:13:19.523 --> 00:13:21.123 line:82%
Anjali, don't feel bad.

219
00:13:21.524 --> 00:13:22.803 line:82%
Look, don't keep
sleeping in the morning.

220
00:13:22.883 --> 00:13:25.522 line:82%
Wake up when the alarm rings.
Otherwise Banku will miss school.

221
00:13:25.658 --> 00:13:28.498 line:82%
That's fine. But before you leave,
make your little scamp understand...

222
00:13:28.564 --> 00:13:31.003 line:82%
that he'll have to
restrain his mischief.

223
00:13:31.124 --> 00:13:32.242 line:82%
Come on. Be realistic, Anjali.

224
00:13:32.363 --> 00:13:34.363 line:82%
We can ask the poor fellow
to do only what he can do.

225
00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.082 line:82%
I say, Banku...

226
00:13:36.443 --> 00:13:38.962 line:82%
do some new
mischief in your new school.

227
00:13:39.124 --> 00:13:40.323 line:82%
Okay? Don't repeat
your old mischief.

228
00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:42.643 line:82%
And look, don't
trouble your mom at all.

229
00:13:42.724 --> 00:13:43.843 line:82%
Otherwise, you know,
I will get very angry.

230
00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:45.740 line:82%
- I've scared him. Now he'll
restrain himself.

231
00:13:45.818 --> 00:13:47.362 line:82%
- Adi... What's going on?

232
00:13:47.684 --> 00:13:49.603 line:82%
You're a father now. Why
don't you behave like one?

233
00:13:49.684 --> 00:13:51.442 line:82%
- What's wrong with you?
- The boy understands English.

234
00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:52.723 line:82%
Don't scold me in front of him.

235
00:13:52.804 --> 00:13:54.202 line:82%
I'll get humiliated. He won't
respect me when he grows up.

236
00:13:54.484 --> 00:13:56.763 line:82%
Banku, close your eyes. I'm
going to kiss your mom now.

237
00:13:57.004 --> 00:13:58.882 line:82%
- Mom. One more, Mommy.
- Adi.

238
00:13:59.544 --> 00:14:01.863 line:82%
Now time for a family hug.
Everyone, come here.

239
00:14:24.083 --> 00:14:27.322 line:82%
- Kunal Behl, division 2C.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:14:27.844 --> 00:14:31.323 line:82%
I recognize the taste.
Very good. Very good.

241
00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:37.843 line:82%
Mrs. Sharma.

242
00:14:37.924 --> 00:14:39.523 line:82%
- Come, sit. Please sit.
- Good morning, sir.

243
00:14:39.844 --> 00:14:41.523 line:82%
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

244
00:14:42.604 --> 00:14:45.202 line:82%
- So this is the boy.
- Yes.

245
00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:47.043 line:82%
- Say "good morning".
- Good morning...

246
00:14:47.123 --> 00:14:49.563 line:82%
Who cooks at your place?

247
00:14:52.004 --> 00:14:55.902 line:82%
We've just moved in. So I'm doing
all the cooking now, but later...

248
00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:58.817 line:82%
Very good. You should
cook with your own hands.

249
00:14:59.684 --> 00:15:01.923 line:82%
You know, for the taste...
it'll taste good.

250
00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:03.283 line:82%
It's good for the child's health.

251
00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:05.763 line:82%
For all of us... it's
good for all of us, right?

252
00:15:07.204 --> 00:15:10.683 line:82%
- Okay.
- So, young man, what's your name?

253
00:15:11.044 --> 00:15:12.883 line:82%
- Banku.
- Banku?

254
00:15:13.444 --> 00:15:15.243 line:82%
Actually, his name is Aman.

255
00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:18.322 line:82%
- But we call him Banku.
- Okay.

256
00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:21.634 line:82%
Banku, we'll also
call you Banku. Okay?

257
00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.123 line:82%
He's such a good boy.

258
00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:27.763 line:82%
He looks like it, but isn't so.

259
00:15:28.604 --> 00:15:30.243 line:82%
What are you saying?

260
00:15:30.323 --> 00:15:33.123 line:82%
Look, he has such innocent eyes.

261
00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:35.043 line:82%
Your eyes are so innocent.

262
00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:39.922 line:82%
- Banku, will you come to school every day?
- Yes.

263
00:15:40.004 --> 00:15:41.923 line:82%
Good. You'll bring a
lunchbox every day?

264
00:15:44.804 --> 00:15:45.883 line:82%
He got scared.

265
00:15:46.084 --> 00:15:47.923 line:82%
Children often get
scared on the first day.

266
00:15:48.484 --> 00:15:50.683 line:82%
Sir, he's not one of those children.

267
00:15:51.004 --> 00:15:53.362 line:82%
From now on, all the
children in the school will cry.

268
00:15:53.843 --> 00:15:56.403 line:82%
- You mean he's naughty?
- A little bit, sir.

269
00:15:56.483 --> 00:15:58.563 line:82%
I like naughty kids very much.

270
00:15:58.684 --> 00:16:01.243 line:82%
You and I will do
mischief together, okay?

271
00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:05.122 line:82%
- Okay.
- Okay. Come on, I'll show you your room.

272
00:16:05.204 --> 00:16:06.243 line:82%
Classroom. Okay?

273
00:16:06.923 --> 00:16:08.122 line:82%
All the best.

274
00:16:08.804 --> 00:16:10.723 line:82%
She said all the best, say "thank you".

275
00:16:11.556 --> 00:16:13.036 line:82%
- She said it to you.
- Thank you.

276
00:16:13.523 --> 00:16:15.963 line:82%
- To me?
- Yes, sir.

277
00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:17.883 line:82%
Come, come.

278
00:16:19.924 --> 00:16:23.722 line:82%
- Children, wish the principal "good
morning". - Good morning, sir.

279
00:16:34.523 --> 00:16:37.803 line:82%
- Bread and fried snacks?
- I don't know, sir.

280
00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:42.643 line:82%
But do you know what I brought for you?

281
00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:47.722 line:82%
A new friend, who will study
in your class from now on.

282
00:16:48.203 --> 00:16:50.722 line:82%
And his name is Banku.

283
00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:52.402 line:82%
Banku.

284
00:16:59.684 --> 00:17:01.603 line:82%
No laughing.

285
00:17:02.404 --> 00:17:06.682 line:82%
Banku, Son, go and sit there,
next to Jojo.

286
00:17:06.803 --> 00:17:07.963 line:82%
- Okay?
- Jojo?

287
00:17:13.604 --> 00:17:16.963 line:82%
No laughing, Banku.
Okay. Bye, class.

288
00:17:17.564 --> 00:17:20.482 line:82%
Amit, I'll see you at recess, okay?

289
00:17:33.124 --> 00:17:36.403 line:82%
Why did you laugh at my name?

290
00:17:36.644 --> 00:17:39.123 line:82%
Look, sir, Jojo is quarrelling again.

291
00:17:39.584 --> 00:17:41.942 line:82%
Jojo, no talking. No fighting.

292
00:17:42.303 --> 00:17:44.183 line:82%
- Banku, do you have your drawing book?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:17:44.384 --> 00:17:46.663 line:82%
Okay, start your drawing.
I'll be back in five minutes.

294
00:17:49.304 --> 00:17:50.863 line:82%
We'll handle him during recess.

295
00:17:51.224 --> 00:17:52.502 line:82%
He's acting very smart.

296
00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:29.915 line:82%
"We're the storm and the cyclone."

297
00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:33.262 line:82%
"No one shall ever rule us."

298
00:18:40.103 --> 00:18:43.383 line:82%
"We're the storm and the cyclone."

299
00:18:43.504 --> 00:18:46.822 line:82%
"No one shall ever rule us."

300
00:18:51.184 --> 00:18:53.782 line:82%
"Don't talk too much."

301
00:18:58.144 --> 00:19:00.543 line:82%
"Do you wish to die?"

302
00:19:00.623 --> 00:19:07.303 line:82%
"No one can dare to
lock horns with us."

303
00:19:07.504 --> 00:19:09.943 line:82%
"Those who try to be smart..."

304
00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:13.983 line:82%
"we're going to hit them hard."

305
00:19:40.504 --> 00:19:47.182 line:82%
"We'll slap you, knock you
out and kick you around."

306
00:19:47.303 --> 00:19:54.022 line:82%
"If you say we'll hit and count."

307
00:19:54.503 --> 00:19:57.943 line:82%
"We are the tigers
of the jungle where..."

308
00:19:58.024 --> 00:20:01.342 line:82%
"you're nothing but a jackal."

309
00:20:01.463 --> 00:20:08.182 line:82%
"If I lose my head, then
don't blame me for what happens."

310
00:20:08.303 --> 00:20:14.943 line:82%
"No one can dare to
lock horns with us."

311
00:20:15.143 --> 00:20:18.103 line:82%
"Those who try to be smart..."

312
00:20:18.184 --> 00:20:21.742 line:82%
"we're going to hit them hard."

313
00:20:48.184 --> 00:20:55.023 line:82%
"Don't mess with us again,
you'll pay for it."

314
00:20:55.144 --> 00:21:01.783 line:82%
"Lock horns with us, if you
want to break your bones."

315
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:05.662 line:82%
"The path we take and
the place where we go."

316
00:21:05.783 --> 00:21:09.063 line:82%
"Don't you dare to come there."

317
00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:15.903 line:82%
"If you cross our paths,
you'll regret for sure."

318
00:21:16.103 --> 00:21:22.702 line:82%
"No one can dare to
lock horns with us."

319
00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:25.303 line:82%
"Those who try to be smart..."

320
00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:29.503 line:82%
"we're going to hit them hard."

321
00:23:01.203 --> 00:23:03.563 line:82%
- Help. Help.
- So it's you. Wait.

322
00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:08.042 line:82%
You. Where will go you? Wait. Wait.

323
00:23:09.164 --> 00:23:12.923 line:82%
- So you are... You are the ghost.
- I am... I am not a ghost.

324
00:23:13.044 --> 00:23:14.243 line:82%
- Then?
- I am Anthony.

325
00:23:14.364 --> 00:23:17.387 line:82%
I... I had... come to steal Pepsi
so that I can mix it in a drink.

326
00:23:17.455 --> 00:23:21.296 line:82%
- Stealing? Stealing? You. Wait.
- Don't hit me.

327
00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:24.482 line:82%
People are scared of coming here,
thanks to you.

328
00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:26.042 line:82%
I've a hard time finding a maid here...

329
00:23:26.124 --> 00:23:27.722 line:82%
and you want to get drunk.

330
00:23:27.804 --> 00:23:31.003 line:82%
- Get down. Get down.
- No. I won't, you'll hit me.

331
00:23:31.083 --> 00:23:33.083 line:82%
- That I will for sure.
- Then I won't come down.

332
00:23:34.844 --> 00:23:37.163 line:82%
Okay, fine, come on, get down.

333
00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:38.603 line:82%
You won't hit me, will you?

334
00:23:38.724 --> 00:23:40.163 line:82%
I won't hit you, get down.

335
00:23:41.523 --> 00:23:44.083 line:82%
I had come here for Pepsi,
but I saw the snacks.

336
00:23:44.204 --> 00:23:46.883 line:82%
I was having drinks
without snacks for so many days.

337
00:23:47.004 --> 00:23:49.523 line:82%
- Go to grocery everyday and
get snacks for me. - Okay.

338
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:51.683 line:82%
- So I will get snacks for you.
- Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

339
00:23:54.404 --> 00:23:58.043 line:82%
- Here you go.
- Don't hit me.

340
00:23:58.404 --> 00:24:00.683 line:82%
- Here you go. You.
- I am doomed.

341
00:24:01.724 --> 00:24:02.762 line:82%
Okay. Okay, stop.

342
00:24:03.804 --> 00:24:06.923 line:82%
- You got tired?
- Stop... I got tired.

343
00:24:09.804 --> 00:24:11.402 line:82%
- What was that?
- My crockery.

344
00:24:12.204 --> 00:24:15.403 line:82%
You broke my crockery.
I will kill you.

345
00:24:17.643 --> 00:24:19.003 line:82%
Don't you come back again or else...

346
00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:26.479 line:82%
First we do this, then you color.

347
00:24:39.963 --> 00:24:41.563 line:82%
- On his white dress.
- My shirt.

348
00:24:42.044 --> 00:24:47.042 line:82%
Five, four, three, two, disappear.

349
00:24:47.364 --> 00:24:48.763 line:82%
- Hey, it disappeared.
- It disappeared.

350
00:24:48.843 --> 00:24:50.522 line:82%
- It actually disappeared.
- It actually disappeared.

351
00:24:50.643 --> 00:24:53.003 line:82%
Exactly. This is disappearing ink.

352
00:24:53.204 --> 00:24:55.283 line:82%
My papa has brought
this from South Africa.

353
00:24:55.644 --> 00:24:58.763 line:82%
Yes, even I have got this.
Use it on peon Prasad.

354
00:24:58.844 --> 00:25:00.643 line:82%
- If you can do this, I will laud you.
- Where is he?

355
00:25:04.683 --> 00:25:06.602 line:82%
- He is coming. He is coming.
- He is coming. He is coming.

356
00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:27.905 line:82%
Sir, sir...
It will just go away, sir...

357
00:25:28.258 --> 00:25:33.030 line:82%
Five, four, three... no, it didn't.

358
00:25:46.707 --> 00:25:50.387 line:82%
I have seen so many tiffins
and kids, but none of the...

359
00:25:50.444 --> 00:25:53.162 line:82%
kids have done what he did to me.

360
00:25:53.244 --> 00:25:55.163 line:82%
I will scold him.
I... I will scold him.

361
00:25:55.457 --> 00:25:57.536 line:82%
But that's only possible
if you tell me about it.

362
00:25:58.124 --> 00:25:59.522 line:82%
You're not even facing me.

363
00:25:59.883 --> 00:26:03.043 line:82%
- Would you like to see?
- Yes.

364
00:26:27.243 --> 00:26:29.363 line:82%
Oh, no, Banku, you naughty boy.

365
00:26:29.484 --> 00:26:34.123 line:82%
- You think that's funny?
- I am so sorry, sir.

366
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.269 line:82%
You're looking so funny that
I couldn't control myself.

367
00:26:38.427 --> 00:26:42.227 line:82%
Then control. Then,
Mrs. Sharma, control...

368
00:26:42.284 --> 00:26:47.003 line:82%
your laughter as
well as this kid of yours.

369
00:26:48.044 --> 00:26:50.762 line:82%
He is not innocent, he
is the devil himself.

370
00:26:50.924 --> 00:26:52.562 line:82%
I had warned you, sir.

371
00:26:53.204 --> 00:26:56.803 line:82%
But I promise that he will
never do such a thing after today.

372
00:26:57.123 --> 00:26:59.522 line:82%
- Banku, say sorry.
- Sorry, sir.

373
00:27:00.284 --> 00:27:01.723 line:82%
It's okay, you can go.

374
00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:08.642 line:82%
Sir... Sir, one small request.

375
00:27:09.764 --> 00:27:11.642 line:82%
Ask someone to take your
photo while you're like this.

376
00:27:12.003 --> 00:27:14.243 line:82%
- What?
- Let's go, Banku.

377
00:27:14.684 --> 00:27:17.642 line:82%
- Sir... shall I call one, sir?
- Who?

378
00:27:17.804 --> 00:27:21.122 line:82%
- A photographer.
- Shut up. Shut up.

379
00:27:25.868 --> 00:27:29.587 line:82%
So you are Jojo?
You changed the ink?

380
00:27:29.644 --> 00:27:31.185 line:82%
Yes, because he was telling everyone...

381
00:27:31.244 --> 00:27:32.443 line:82%
that, "I have this and I have that".

382
00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:33.740 line:82%
Yes, I have.
So why won't I show it?

383
00:27:33.924 --> 00:27:36.763 line:82%
Hey, hey, what is this?
Is this a WWF now?

384
00:27:36.924 --> 00:27:38.522 line:82%
Come on, let's just stop fighting.

385
00:27:39.112 --> 00:27:40.671 line:82%
Come on, let's get
you two to be friends.

386
00:27:40.968 --> 00:27:42.567 line:82%
Lets shake hands.

387
00:27:43.923 --> 00:27:44.963 line:82%
Hey, come on.

388
00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:51.323 line:82%
Jojo, come to play with Banku...

389
00:27:51.404 --> 00:27:52.802 line:82%
at our home sometimes.

390
00:27:52.923 --> 00:27:54.763 line:82%
Yes, we have quite a big terrace.

391
00:27:54.843 --> 00:27:55.883 line:82%
Really? Where do you stay?

392
00:27:55.964 --> 00:27:57.002 line:82%
Nath Villa.

393
00:27:57.243 --> 00:27:59.642 line:82%
Nath Villa? No. I won't go there.

394
00:27:59.724 --> 00:28:00.763 line:82%
That's where the ghost lives.

395
00:28:02.084 --> 00:28:04.883 line:82%
- 'A ghost resides there.'
- Ghost?

396
00:28:13.484 --> 00:28:15.242 line:82%
Mama, what is a ghost?

397
00:28:16.284 --> 00:28:18.203 line:82%
When you won't do your homework...

398
00:28:18.284 --> 00:28:20.923 line:82%
and someone will come and
beat you up, that's a ghost.

399
00:28:21.223 --> 00:28:24.063 line:82%
Do we have a ghost in our house?
Everyone says that.

400
00:28:28.864 --> 00:28:30.983 line:82%
Son, there's no such thing as a ghost.

401
00:28:31.504 --> 00:28:33.960 line:82%
There was a thief named
Anthony who lurked in our...

402
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.102 line:82%
house and tried to scare
everyone away.

403
00:28:36.384 --> 00:28:38.112 line:82%
Today I beat him up and
drove him out.

404
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.369 line:82%
- Really? You beat him up?
- That's right.

405
00:28:40.824 --> 00:28:42.383 line:82%
He was trying to steal
things from the kitchen.

406
00:28:42.624 --> 00:28:46.583 line:82%
- I just made him run away.
- So he was possessed by a ghost?

407
00:28:47.704 --> 00:28:50.223 line:82%
Ghosts don't exist.
There are just angels.

408
00:28:53.084 --> 00:28:54.802 line:82%
Angels? What is an angel?

409
00:28:55.364 --> 00:28:59.131 line:82%
Angels. When someone
makes the God happy...

410
00:28:59.452 --> 00:29:03.416 line:82%
God makes him an angel.
Like your grandfather.

411
00:29:04.224 --> 00:29:07.263 line:82%
When your grandfather
went to God, God said...

412
00:29:07.344 --> 00:29:09.702 line:82%
"Hey, you are Banku's grandfather".

413
00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:12.491 line:82%
"So I will turn you
into a star, so..."

414
00:29:12.957 --> 00:29:15.860 line:82%
"that you can watch Banku forever".

415
00:29:15.959 --> 00:29:18.998 line:82%
Mama, have you seen an angel?

416
00:29:20.824 --> 00:29:25.623 line:82%
Yes, I have. And his name is Banku.
Banku. Banku. Banku.

417
00:29:27.984 --> 00:29:30.063 line:82%
- What if I find an angel someday?
- Yes?

418
00:29:30.153 --> 00:29:31.191 line:82%
What will I do...

419
00:29:31.783 --> 00:29:35.022 line:82%
Just befriend with him
and tell him your stories.

420
00:29:37.663 --> 00:29:38.783 line:82%
What will he looks like?

421
00:29:41.184 --> 00:29:44.262 line:82%
If grandfather has sent him,
then he will look like him.

422
00:29:44.344 --> 00:29:46.344 line:82%
- Then I will recognize him.
- Yes.

423
00:29:47.403 --> 00:29:49.442 line:82%
Papa's call.

424
00:29:49.683 --> 00:29:51.083 line:82%
Banku, slowly. The stairs.

425
00:29:52.923 --> 00:29:54.482 line:82%
- Papa.
- Great. Naughty boy.

426
00:29:54.804 --> 00:29:56.203 line:82%
How did you know it
was your papa's call?

427
00:29:56.324 --> 00:29:59.003 line:82%
- What were you doing?
- Do you know, today I spilled ink...

428
00:29:59.084 --> 00:30:00.403 line:82%
on the principal at school.

429
00:30:00.684 --> 00:30:03.443 line:82%
Oh, very good. Very good. You
started pulling pranks again.

430
00:30:03.564 --> 00:30:04.265 line:82%
Exactly.

431
00:30:04.355 --> 00:30:06.027 line:82%
They called me to
school on the first day itself.

432
00:30:06.164 --> 00:30:08.402 line:82%
Tell him something or
else he will be rusticated.

433
00:30:09.284 --> 00:30:10.843 line:82%
And how is your work going on?

434
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.898 line:82%
Anjali, the workload is
quite heavy, I might come late.

435
00:30:14.464 --> 00:30:15.943 line:82%
- Did you set everything in the house?
- No.

436
00:30:16.363 --> 00:30:17.802 line:82%
The luggage has arrived from the cargo.

437
00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:19.503 line:82%
But I just can't find a maid.

438
00:30:19.663 --> 00:30:21.423 line:82%
Everyone is scared because
of the legend of the ghost.

439
00:30:21.583 --> 00:30:23.022 line:82%
And ghosts don't exist.

440
00:30:24.943 --> 00:30:26.423 line:82%
There can't be any
better ghost than him.

441
00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:36.222 line:82%
- Good night.
- Good night.

442
00:31:12.943 --> 00:31:13.983 line:82%
Ice-cream.

443
00:31:42.264 --> 00:31:46.542 line:82%
Mama.

444
00:31:48.384 --> 00:31:49.422 line:82%
Banku.

445
00:31:49.543 --> 00:31:50.583 line:82%
Mama.

446
00:31:51.504 --> 00:31:55.782 line:82%
- Banku, what happened?
- I just saw someone here.

447
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.999 line:82%
- Where?
- There.

448
00:32:03.223 --> 00:32:04.623 line:82%
But what were you doing here?

449
00:32:04.944 --> 00:32:06.983 line:82%
I just took out some
ice-cream and I turned...

450
00:32:07.124 --> 00:32:12.002 line:82%
- Ice-cream? Didn't I tell you not to?
- Just a little.

451
00:32:12.444 --> 00:32:16.802 line:82%
And that also spilled down...
Hey, where is the bowl?

452
00:32:22.844 --> 00:32:25.283 line:82%
Mama, the bowl and
spoon were right here.

453
00:32:25.604 --> 00:32:27.482 line:82%
First, you ate
ice-cream without asking me...

454
00:32:28.364 --> 00:32:29.963 line:82%
and on the top of that,
you say you saw someone?

455
00:32:30.363 --> 00:32:31.763 line:82%
It's true. I saw someone here.

456
00:32:31.964 --> 00:32:34.963 line:82%
I told you about the angel and
you started spinning a tale.

457
00:32:35.244 --> 00:32:37.082 line:82%
You'll start crying if I hit you now.

458
00:32:37.244 --> 00:32:38.402 line:82%
Just go upstairs.

459
00:32:38.924 --> 00:32:41.282 line:82%
And don't touch the
fridge without my permission.

460
00:32:42.204 --> 00:32:43.802 line:82%
How will you get up early
in the morning for school?

461
00:32:44.163 --> 00:32:45.683 line:82%
Forget you, how will I get up?

462
00:32:46.083 --> 00:32:47.243 line:82%
You've become so mischievous.

463
00:32:47.643 --> 00:32:49.283 line:82%
You should be sent
to a boarding school.

464
00:32:49.404 --> 00:32:54.242 line:82%
Hey. Let's go upstairs.
So much drama for some ice-cream.

465
00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:55.363 line:82%
Someone's there.

466
00:32:55.884 --> 00:32:57.403 line:82%
Now why are you looking here and there?

467
00:32:57.483 --> 00:32:58.802 line:82%
Come on, come upstairs.

468
00:33:00.784 --> 00:33:05.062 line:82%
I opened the fridge,
took out the ice-cream.

469
00:33:07.343 --> 00:33:11.902 line:82%
The bowl fell from my hand,
then where did it go?

470
00:33:17.063 --> 00:33:18.103 line:82%
Look at this.

471
00:33:18.152 --> 00:33:20.613 line:82%
I said that the bowl
has fallen over here...

472
00:33:20.743 --> 00:33:22.302 line:82%
but mama doesn't believe me.

473
00:34:10.583 --> 00:34:12.183 line:82%
You had hidden the bowl, hadn't you?

474
00:34:15.344 --> 00:34:17.663 line:82%
You have come to steal
the ice-cream?

475
00:34:20.924 --> 00:34:25.323 line:82%
Okay, so you are Anthony,
who was beaten up by mama.

476
00:34:25.983 --> 00:34:27.103 line:82%
I am a ghost.

477
00:34:27.749 --> 00:34:32.868 line:82%
Ghosts don't exist.
Mama said that angels exist.

478
00:34:33.516 --> 00:34:35.716 line:82%
Okay, so you're an angel.

479
00:34:36.303 --> 00:34:37.382 line:82%
I said I am a ghost.

480
00:34:38.424 --> 00:34:39.463 line:82%
I said ghosts don't exist.

481
00:34:39.903 --> 00:34:41.903 line:82%
Okay, so you have come to stay here.

482
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:43.528 line:82%
No. This is my house.

483
00:34:44.397 --> 00:34:45.755 line:82%
I have come here to
drive you out from here.

484
00:34:46.224 --> 00:34:47.303 line:82%
This is our house.

485
00:34:47.645 --> 00:34:48.685 line:82%
This is my house.

486
00:34:48.791 --> 00:34:51.550 line:82%
- This is our house. Softly, softly.
- I said this is my house.

487
00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:54.992 line:82%
If mama hears us, then this
won't remain anybody's house.

488
00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.768 line:82%
You little boy, you talk too much.

489
00:34:59.343 --> 00:35:02.063 line:82%
Wait. Little boy.
I will teach him a lesson.

490
00:35:03.063 --> 00:35:06.263 line:82%
You tall fellow, my
name is Banku. And yours?

491
00:35:07.177 --> 00:35:09.775 line:82%
Didn't you see my name
outside at the gate? Nath.

492
00:35:10.704 --> 00:35:11.983 line:82%
Sometimes you say you
are a 'Bhoot' (Ghost)...

493
00:35:12.063 --> 00:35:13.103 line:82%
sometimes you say you are Nath.

494
00:35:13.743 --> 00:35:16.022 line:82%
Okay, is your name Bhootnath?

495
00:35:16.143 --> 00:35:18.062 line:82%
I am a ghost and not Bhootnath.

496
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:19.781 line:82%
This is my house. Come on,
get out of here.

497
00:35:20.223 --> 00:35:23.822 line:82%
I said it's our house,
but you can stay here.

498
00:35:24.144 --> 00:35:25.622 line:82%
I'll convince mama.

499
00:35:27.104 --> 00:35:29.903 line:82%
So you won't agree like that.
I'll have to do something.

500
00:35:30.381 --> 00:35:31.421 line:82%
What will you do?

501
00:35:32.253 --> 00:35:33.291 line:82%
Wait. I'll tell you.

502
00:35:53.823 --> 00:35:55.742 line:82%
Hey, why are you laughing?

503
00:35:55.983 --> 00:35:58.183 line:82%
- You're making funny faces.
- Funny faces?

504
00:35:58.544 --> 00:36:00.383 line:82%
Of course. If you take part
in a fancy dress competition...

505
00:36:00.464 --> 00:36:01.502 line:82%
you'll win the first prize.

506
00:36:02.624 --> 00:36:03.983 line:82%
He's a strange child.
The whole world is scared...

507
00:36:04.064 --> 00:36:05.102 line:82%
of me and he laughs at me.

508
00:36:05.984 --> 00:36:08.623 line:82%
Hey, I am trying to scare you.
Don't you get scared?

509
00:36:09.264 --> 00:36:11.303 line:82%
- Do you get scared?
- Why should I get scared?

510
00:36:17.384 --> 00:36:21.302 line:82%
Everyone says a ghost
resides here. Have you seen him?

511
00:36:21.423 --> 00:36:22.463 line:82%
Why would I see him?

512
00:36:22.584 --> 00:36:25.583 line:82%
But don't get scared.
I stay in this room with mama.

513
00:36:25.704 --> 00:36:27.302 line:82%
If you get scared, then just call me.

514
00:36:27.903 --> 00:36:28.982 line:82%
Now we are friends, aren't we?

515
00:36:31.709 --> 00:36:32.748 line:82%
Friends?

516
00:36:33.504 --> 00:36:34.823 line:82%
- One more thing.
- What?

517
00:36:35.184 --> 00:36:37.142 line:82%
- Come closer.
- What?

518
00:36:37.224 --> 00:36:38.263 line:82%
I want to go to the bathroom.

519
00:36:39.104 --> 00:36:41.023 line:82%
- Bathroom?
- Bathroom.

520
00:36:41.664 --> 00:36:43.423 line:82%
- Then go.
- Come with me.

521
00:36:43.544 --> 00:36:44.582 line:82%
You go. Why would I come with you?

522
00:36:51.144 --> 00:36:58.223 line:82%
Am I... a ghost... or not?

523
00:37:02.893 --> 00:37:03.932 line:82%
Even you want to go to
the bathroom, don't you?

524
00:37:04.093 --> 00:37:05.772 line:82%
Hey, quiet, go away.

525
00:37:18.891 --> 00:37:20.570 line:82%
Glory to Lord Hanuman (Indian God).
Ocean of wisdom and virtue...

526
00:37:22.064 --> 00:37:23.423 line:82%
Glory to Lord Hanuman.
Ocean of wisdom and virtue...

527
00:37:25.143 --> 00:37:28.423 line:82%
Hey... Hey...

528
00:37:34.904 --> 00:37:38.222 line:82%
He got scared. I am a ghost.

529
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.062 line:82%
Now I'll teach a
lesson to this little one.

530
00:37:53.411 --> 00:37:55.891 line:82%
Little boy, you're sleeping.
Come on, get up.

531
00:37:56.104 --> 00:37:57.783 line:82%
- Let me sleep.
- Get up. Get up. Get up.

532
00:37:57.983 --> 00:38:00.583 line:82%
- Let me sleep.
- Get up. I said get up.

533
00:38:01.739 --> 00:38:06.219 line:82%
He slept. Now how will he get up?

534
00:38:16.634 --> 00:38:20.033 line:82%
Wake up, Banku... Banku.

535
00:38:25.617 --> 00:38:30.176 line:82%
Hey, he went down again.

536
00:38:33.199 --> 00:38:34.423 line:82%
Ice-cream.

537
00:38:41.224 --> 00:38:44.542 line:82%
- My naughty angel.
- Angel.

538
00:38:48.664 --> 00:38:51.903 line:82%
- You know who had hidden this bowl?
- Who?

539
00:38:52.103 --> 00:38:54.502 line:82%
Angel. An angel resides
in our house.

540
00:38:54.743 --> 00:38:58.183 line:82%
Really? Then he must have
eaten this ice-cream, too.

541
00:38:58.424 --> 00:39:00.583 line:82%
No, he didn't. I even asked him.

542
00:39:00.743 --> 00:39:04.383 line:82%
Now he will stay here with us.
Now I am his friend.

543
00:39:05.303 --> 00:39:08.983 line:82%
Good, I will tell the angel
to brush your teeth everyday...

544
00:39:09.064 --> 00:39:10.903 line:82%
help you with your
homework and take you to school.

545
00:39:11.183 --> 00:39:12.223 line:82%
Alone?

546
00:39:15.184 --> 00:39:18.423 line:82%
- And you know what he said?
- Tell me that afterwards.

547
00:39:18.503 --> 00:39:19.582 line:82%
You're getting late
for school. Come on.

548
00:39:19.984 --> 00:39:21.964 line:82%
Mama, it's not a story.
This angel really exists.

549
00:39:22.004 --> 00:39:24.369 line:82%
Yes, I am not denying it.
Okay, listen there shouldn't...

550
00:39:24.783 --> 00:39:27.182 line:82%
be any complaints about
you in school today. Okay?

551
00:39:27.472 --> 00:39:28.512 line:82%
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye.

552
00:39:28.623 --> 00:39:29.661 line:82%
Bye, angel.

553
00:39:30.263 --> 00:39:33.622 line:82%
You and your angel.

554
00:39:42.503 --> 00:39:44.503 line:82%
I saw there was a tall man wearing...

555
00:39:44.584 --> 00:39:47.983 line:82%
a black coat standing in front of me.

556
00:39:48.896 --> 00:39:52.336 line:82%
I got up and went to him.
I asked him, "Yes?"

557
00:39:52.664 --> 00:39:55.303 line:82%
"Who are you? What are
you doing in my house?"

558
00:39:55.463 --> 00:39:56.743 line:82%
He turned towards me.

559
00:39:57.844 --> 00:40:00.803 line:82%
He had long hands.

560
00:40:01.123 --> 00:40:04.242 line:82%
His teeth were also black,
his eyes were red.

561
00:40:04.864 --> 00:40:06.382 line:82%
Is this an angel or a ghost?

562
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.098 line:82%
Cleaning.

563
00:40:11.224 --> 00:40:12.423 line:82%
Such a big house to clean.

564
00:40:44.783 --> 00:40:46.983 line:82%
Hey, why are you still standing here?

565
00:40:47.303 --> 00:40:48.742 line:82%
Do you want to get beaten up again?

566
00:40:49.103 --> 00:40:52.069 line:82%
This was my house.
I don't have a place to stay.

567
00:40:52.094 --> 00:40:53.173 line:82%
Nor any work to do.

568
00:40:56.323 --> 00:40:59.202 line:82%
- Will you clean the house?
- I'll clean everything.

569
00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:03.042 line:82%
Don't steal anything or I'll
get you arrested by the police.

570
00:41:04.483 --> 00:41:07.722 line:82%
If you work properly, then
I'll give you Rs. 20 a day.

571
00:41:08.323 --> 00:41:11.243 line:82%
Give me Rs. 25. I'll be able
to buy a bottle of liquor then.

572
00:41:11.364 --> 00:41:14.202 line:82%
- Please. Please.
- Come on, pick up the broom.

573
00:41:14.323 --> 00:41:15.522 line:82%
- Come on, hurry up.
- Thank you.

574
00:41:15.944 --> 00:41:20.743 line:82%
Come on, start from
here and you are so dirty.

575
00:41:21.364 --> 00:41:22.403 line:82%
Go, have a bath first.

576
00:41:46.564 --> 00:41:47.603 line:82%
Yes.

577
00:42:06.684 --> 00:42:08.643 line:82%
Come on, give me Rs. 25. Hey.

578
00:42:20.203 --> 00:42:28.923 line:82%
Hey.

579
00:42:45.604 --> 00:42:46.923 line:82%
Go away. Go away.

580
00:42:51.364 --> 00:42:52.403 line:82%
Look at this.

581
00:42:54.403 --> 00:42:56.562 line:82%
- What are you looking at?
- Can't you see?

582
00:42:57.204 --> 00:42:59.523 line:82%
I am seeing everything.
You haven't cleaned anything.

583
00:42:59.683 --> 00:43:01.043 line:82%
There's so much work pending inside.

584
00:43:01.123 --> 00:43:02.442 line:82%
The things have to
be shifted. Come on.

585
00:43:34.723 --> 00:43:38.802 line:82%
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

586
00:43:39.043 --> 00:43:40.323 line:82%
The wind is blowing on its own.

587
00:43:40.644 --> 00:43:43.283 line:82%
The wind blows on its own.
What have you done?

588
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.239 line:82%
You spread it all.
Who's going to clean it?

589
00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:47.963 line:82%
Don't sit.

590
00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:54.882 line:82%
Who asked you to sit?
Come on, get up.

591
00:43:58.998 --> 00:44:00.814 line:82%
Here? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

592
00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:03.363 line:82%
- Hit me.
- What?

593
00:44:03.444 --> 00:44:04.482 line:82%
No, hit me. Hit me. Hit me.

594
00:44:04.963 --> 00:44:06.347 line:82%
- Hit me.
- Alright.

595
00:44:06.496 --> 00:44:10.695 line:82%
- Yes.
- Who else is hitting me?

596
00:44:11.484 --> 00:44:13.242 line:82%
She hit me from here,
who hit me from here?

597
00:44:13.324 --> 00:44:15.443 line:82%
Come on, move the box
from there. Come on.

598
00:44:15.763 --> 00:44:18.563 line:82%
- Someone else is hitting me.
- Look at him.

599
00:44:19.204 --> 00:44:21.083 line:82%
Are you going to work or not?
Come on, go there.

600
00:44:21.324 --> 00:44:22.362 line:82%
- Work...
- Careful.

601
00:44:23.524 --> 00:44:26.043 line:82%
- Look at him.
- Who else is hitting me?

602
00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:29.442 line:82%
Who else is hitting me?

603
00:44:35.524 --> 00:44:37.002 line:82%
Come on, move it.

604
00:45:00.004 --> 00:45:04.323 line:82%
No, no, no, no. I...
I... it's not my fault.

605
00:45:04.404 --> 00:45:08.723 line:82%
It's... it's not my fault. Hold this.
Hold this. It's not my fault.

606
00:45:08.803 --> 00:45:12.843 line:82%
- You.
- It's not... She didn't even pay me.

607
00:45:14.644 --> 00:45:16.563 line:82%
I don't want to live in this house.

608
00:45:21.604 --> 00:45:23.442 line:82%
Aditya, I don't want to live here.

609
00:45:23.844 --> 00:45:26.922 line:82%
Ask your company to

- Dr. Bahal?

762
00:57:40.489 --> 00:57:41.729 line:82%
- Here he is. What's wrong?
- Doctor, please.

763
00:57:41.903 --> 00:57:43.023 line:82%
- Doctor, have a look.
- My God.

764
00:57:43.103 --> 00:57:44.263 line:82%
It's a deep cut.
How did this happen?

765
00:57:45.263 --> 00:57:47.583 line:82%
I don't know. I was in the kitchen.

766
00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:49.222 line:82%
I heard him fall down...

767
00:57:49.304 --> 00:57:50.343 line:82%
- and when I saw him...
- Okay. Relax, ma'am. Take it easy.

768
00:57:51.023 --> 00:57:52.143 line:82%
- He was unconscious.
- Take him to the MRI room.

769
00:57:52.223 --> 00:57:53.263 line:82%
I hope it's not a hemorrhage.

770
00:57:53.475 --> 00:57:54.513 line:82%
He must regain consciousness...

771
00:57:54.625 --> 00:57:55.904 line:82%
- or he might lapse into a coma.
- What?

772
00:57:56.783 --> 00:57:59.023 line:82%
- Come on, move. Page Dr. Mishra fast. Yes.
- No. No.

773
00:57:59.463 --> 00:58:04.103 line:82%
Banku. Banku...

774
00:58:04.983 --> 00:58:06.662 line:82%
isn’t she the lady who
stays in the haunted house?

775
00:58:06.979 --> 00:58:08.497 line:82%
Yes. The ghost did his job.

776
00:58:18.824 --> 00:58:20.263 line:82%
Please wait here. We'll
take care of him. Okay?

777
00:58:20.327 --> 00:58:22.087 line:82%
No, doctor. Please,
let me be with him.

778
00:58:22.184 --> 00:58:23.863 line:82%
Madam, please wait here.
We'll take care of him.

779
00:58:24.024 --> 00:58:26.342 line:82%
- Please relax. He'll be fine.
- Please, doctor. Let me...

780
00:58:36.494 --> 00:58:38.511 line:82%
Come, sit down. Sit.

781
00:58:39.721 --> 00:58:41.880 line:82%
- Sit.
- He's badly injured.

782
00:58:43.764 --> 00:58:45.944 line:82%
If he doesn't regain consciousness...

783
00:58:47.364 --> 00:58:49.323 line:82%
he'll slip into a coma.

784
00:58:50.524 --> 00:58:53.508 line:82%
Don't worry. God will
make everything alright.

785
00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:57.422 line:82%
- What if something happens to him?
- Relax.

786
00:58:58.223 --> 00:58:59.263 line:82%
He'll be alright.

787
00:59:16.823 --> 00:59:18.583 line:82%
What happened, doctor?
How is he now?

788
00:59:19.024 --> 00:59:20.062 line:82%
Has he regained consciousness?

789
00:59:21.165 --> 00:59:22.822 line:82%
He's okay, right? Tell me.

790
00:59:22.963 --> 00:59:26.523 line:82%
Ma'am, thank God that
there was no blood clot.

791
00:59:27.079 --> 00:59:28.119 line:82%
He's fine.

792
00:59:30.444 --> 00:59:31.482 line:82%
Please come.

793
00:59:35.724 --> 00:59:36.762 line:82%
Banku.

794
00:59:37.483 --> 00:59:38.523 line:82%
Banku...

795
00:59:57.128 --> 00:59:58.167 line:82%
Banku.

796
01:00:16.986 --> 01:00:19.985 line:82%
Mama...

797
01:00:22.924 --> 01:00:25.002 line:82%
Banku? Banku.

798
01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.963 line:82%
Doctor. Doctor.

799
01:00:39.023 --> 01:00:41.263 line:82%
How do you feel,
Son? Does it hurt now?

800
01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:43.503 line:82%
A little.

801
01:00:44.244 --> 01:00:45.283 line:82%
Son, how did you fall down?

802
01:00:48.924 --> 01:00:49.962 line:82%
I was playing cricket.

803
01:00:53.164 --> 01:00:54.483 line:82%
I just ran to catch the ball.

804
01:00:57.283 --> 01:00:59.082 line:82%
My foot slipped on the stairs.

805
01:01:04.382 --> 01:01:07.820 line:82%
I always told you to be
careful on the stairs.

806
01:01:08.044 --> 01:01:12.161 line:82%
You won't listen. I always tell him.
Did you see what happened?

807
01:01:12.684 --> 01:01:14.043 line:82%
His wound will heal soon...

808
01:01:14.624 --> 01:01:16.262 line:82%
and he'll start playing cricket again.

809
01:01:19.404 --> 01:01:20.843 line:82%
Mama, you got scared, didn't you?

810
01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:25.383 line:82%
I have just my one darling child.

811
01:01:28.943 --> 01:01:30.382 line:82%
How could I have not gotten scared?

812
01:01:32.144 --> 01:01:33.423 line:82%
What if something had happened to you?

813
01:01:36.364 --> 01:01:38.643 line:82%
Mama, I bother you a lot, don't I?

814
01:01:39.643 --> 01:01:43.323 line:82%
No. You're my good boy.

815
01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:45.963 line:82%
Then may I have ice cream?

816
01:01:50.063 --> 01:01:53.023 line:82%
You're a monkey.
You're still up to mischief.

817
01:01:56.144 --> 01:01:57.703 line:82%
I'll go call up your papa and be back.

818
01:02:17.584 --> 01:02:19.983 line:82%
Bhootnath, where had you gone?

819
01:02:22.603 --> 01:02:24.723 line:82%
You know, I fainted.

820
01:02:26.724 --> 01:02:28.323 line:82%
I bled a lot as well.

821
01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:32.857 line:82%
No. You fell because
of me, didn't you?

822
01:02:33.403 --> 01:02:37.002 line:82%
No, I was playing and I fell down.

823
01:02:37.324 --> 01:02:39.402 line:82%
We often get hurt
when we play, don't we?

824
01:02:44.624 --> 01:02:46.863 line:82%
I'm hurt like you had been.

825
01:02:51.784 --> 01:02:55.983 line:82%
You wouldn't have fallen
if I had held your hand?

826
01:02:56.944 --> 01:03:00.463 line:82%
You know, even my
grandpa couldn't hold my hand.

827
01:03:02.403 --> 01:03:04.243 line:82%
You're like my grandpa, aren't you?

828
01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.680 line:82%
You think I'm like your grandpa.

829
01:03:20.844 --> 01:03:22.083 line:82%
You think I'm an angel.

830
01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:28.763 line:82%
And I tell you...

831
01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:35.963 line:82%
I don't know if I'm an angel or not.

832
01:03:39.403 --> 01:03:42.563 line:82%
But you're really an angel.

833
01:03:44.044 --> 01:03:45.083 line:82%
My angel.

834
01:03:49.843 --> 01:03:51.003 line:82%
Forgive me.

835
01:03:54.084 --> 01:03:56.363 line:82%
Please, forgive me.

836
01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:01.643 line:82%
Forgive me.

837
01:04:12.524 --> 01:04:13.723 line:82%
Hello... Hello?

838
01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.007 line:82%
- Hello?
- Jagan, Vijay Nath speaking.

839
01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:17.483 line:82%
Hey, Mr. Vijay,
you'll live a long life.

840
01:04:17.683 --> 01:04:18.723 line:82%
I was just thinking about you.

841
01:04:19.123 --> 01:04:20.322 line:82%
Okay, listen. I'm
coming to Goa next week.

842
01:04:20.404 --> 01:04:21.443 line:82%
I'll be staying at the Grand Hyatt.

843
01:04:21.523 --> 01:04:24.203 line:82%
Come. Come. I want to give you
some good news about the house.

844
01:04:24.283 --> 01:04:25.763 line:82%
Yes, I've thought of
something for the house.

845
01:04:25.843 --> 01:04:26.883 line:82%
Thought of something?

846
01:04:27.604 --> 01:04:29.043 line:82%
I'll tell you when I get there.
Okay?

847
01:04:31.924 --> 01:04:33.162 line:82%
What have you thought
about the house?

848
01:04:42.364 --> 01:04:43.883 line:82%
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

849
01:04:45.364 --> 01:04:48.563 line:82%
Get up. Get up. Come on.

850
01:04:48.643 --> 01:04:52.242 line:82%
Great. You're awake.
How do you feel now?

851
01:04:52.963 --> 01:04:54.282 line:82%
Come on, let me see.

852
01:05:00.724 --> 01:05:01.763 line:82%
Does it hurt?

853
01:05:02.964 --> 01:05:05.243 line:82%
It's much better now. Good.

854
01:05:06.364 --> 01:05:09.123 line:82%
Now get up and brush your teeth.

855
01:05:18.324 --> 01:05:20.163 line:82%
Come on, champion. Here's your milk.

856
01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:22.962 line:82%
- Come on.
- So much?

857
01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:24.083 line:82%
Finish it all.

858
01:05:42.403 --> 01:05:43.602 line:82%
What will you have for breakfast?

859
01:05:44.404 --> 01:05:45.923 line:82%
- Potato stuffed flatbreads.
- Potato stuffed flatbreads.

860
01:05:47.764 --> 01:05:48.882 line:82%
Potato stuffed flatbreads?

861
01:05:50.203 --> 01:05:53.562 line:82%
You are just recovering.
Have something light.

862
01:05:53.644 --> 01:05:55.602 line:82%
I'll make you a sandwich.

863
01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:57.762 line:82%
- No, no. Potato stuffed flatbreads.
- No, no. Potato stuffed flatbreads.

864
01:06:00.204 --> 01:06:01.842 line:82%
You can't finish even one.

865
01:06:02.484 --> 01:06:03.563 line:82%
Then you'll have to
finish the whole thing.

866
01:06:08.884 --> 01:06:09.923 line:82%
- Yes.

867
01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.283 line:82%

01:06:23.923 --> 01:06:26.442 line:82%
- One more.

869
01:06:35.284 --> 01:06:37.403 line:82%
- One more.
- it's coming... coming...

870
01:06:37.483 --> 01:06:38.523 line:82%
it's coming... coming...

871
01:06:43.363 --> 01:06:48.963 line:82%
- One more.
- No, the potatoes are over. One more.

872
01:06:53.644 --> 01:06:54.683 line:82%
Sorry.

873
01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:55.883 line:82%
Is Banku alright now?

874
01:06:56.563 --> 01:06:59.082 line:82%
Is he alright? He's had
four stuffed flatbreads.

875
01:07:00.324 --> 01:07:01.683 line:82%
He ate four stuffed flatbreads,
that's alright.

876
01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:04.043 line:82%
But aren't you tired
preparing four stuffed flatbreads?

877
01:07:05.203 --> 01:07:07.443 line:82%
- Adi, you're too much.
- Okay, love you, too.

878
01:07:22.459 --> 01:07:23.498 line:82%
Please. Please.

879
01:07:28.288 --> 01:07:31.086 line:82%
Hey, where is it?

880
01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:34.496 line:82%
Yes.

881
01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.863 line:82%
Does it hurt?

882
01:07:40.704 --> 01:07:41.962 line:82%
- See, they're so dirty.
- No. No.

883
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.280 line:82%
- No, please give me.
- I don't want to.

884
01:07:44.864 --> 01:07:47.543 line:82%
- No, no, no.
- Please give me, they are so dirty.

885
01:07:52.144 --> 01:07:53.183 line:82%
Bhootnath.

886
01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:55.077 line:82%
Then? Let's go.

887
01:07:58.444 --> 01:08:00.202 line:82%
Look, I am late because of you.

888
01:08:00.884 --> 01:08:04.123 line:82%
- Banku. Banku.
- Bye, Mummy. Bye, Papa.

889
01:08:05.723 --> 01:08:06.763 line:82%
Banku.

890
01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:11.412 line:82%
Banku. Banku. Hey, Banku.

891
01:08:13.084 --> 01:08:14.122 line:82%
Banku...

892
01:08:14.204 --> 01:08:15.562 line:82%
Excuse me, mister,
which class is Banku in?

893
01:08:15.644 --> 01:08:17.403 line:82%
- Excuse me...
- Hey. Who is that?

894
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:21.110 line:82%
Banku... Banku...

895
01:08:23.438 --> 01:08:24.757 line:82%
Where's Bhootnath?

896
01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:29.998 line:82%
- Children, today we'll learn how...
- Banku... Banku...

897
01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.343 line:82%
- A lion hunts for his prey.
- Banku...

898
01:08:34.904 --> 01:08:37.063 line:82%
First the lion gets happy on seeing...

899
01:08:37.144 --> 01:08:40.503 line:82%
his prey and wags his tail.

900
01:08:51.143 --> 01:08:53.143 line:82%
It is wagging, sir.

901
01:08:53.224 --> 01:08:54.262 line:82%
I know. I know.

902
01:08:55.583 --> 01:08:59.623 line:82%
The lion slowly moves towards his prey.

903
01:09:03.304 --> 01:09:04.743 line:82%
It's moving, sir.

904
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.658 line:82%
After that he jumps.

905
01:09:08.183 --> 01:09:10.023 line:82%
- It's gone, sir.
- Yes... Yes, it's gone.

906
01:09:10.103 --> 01:09:15.183 line:82%
- It's really gone, sir.
- Where did it go?

907
01:09:15.485 --> 01:09:16.524 line:82%
To hunt.

908
01:09:20.903 --> 01:09:21.943 line:82%
Banku.

909
01:09:22.064 --> 01:09:24.782 line:82%
What is this? The
same tiffin every day?

910
01:09:25.263 --> 01:09:26.303 line:82%
Don't you feel ashamed?

911
01:09:26.864 --> 01:09:28.463 line:82%
Can't you bring
anything other than sandwich?

912
01:09:31.263 --> 01:09:32.303 line:82%
Angel.

913
01:09:32.584 --> 01:09:35.902 line:82%
Correct. Banku dear.
Banku, how do you spell angel?

914
01:09:36.184 --> 01:09:40.943 line:82%
- A N G E L.
- Very good.

915
01:09:41.224 --> 01:09:45.622 line:82%
A N G...

916
01:09:49.703 --> 01:09:50.743 line:82%
Bhootnath.

917
01:09:51.283 --> 01:09:53.802 line:82%
- Banku, where were you?
- Where had you been?

918
01:09:54.063 --> 01:09:55.583 line:82%
Hey, it's such a big school,
there are so many children...

919
01:09:55.664 --> 01:09:57.182 line:82%
and everyone has worn
similar looking uniforms.

920
01:09:57.264 --> 01:10:00.143 line:82%
It becomes very difficult.
Your principal, he is...

921
01:10:00.224 --> 01:10:01.262 line:82%
Principal Sir.

922
01:10:02.984 --> 01:10:04.142 line:82%
He eats from the tiffins of children.

923
01:10:04.503 --> 01:10:06.542 line:82%
Let's go. If he sees us,
he'll eat ours, too.

924
01:10:07.298 --> 01:10:09.405 line:82%
Wait... Wait. Only if he sees us.

925
01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:17.658 line:82%

930
01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:34.783 line:82%

931
01:10:36.303 --> 01:10:37.343 line:82%
Take it out.

932
01:10:41.943 --> 01:10:43.663 line:82%

- No, no, there's sandwich.
- No, no, there's sandwich.

938

Sandwich, cutlet.

939
01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:03.088 line:82%
Sandwich. Saved. Saved.

940
01:11:03.264 --> 01:11:04.382 line:82%
No, but mummy had given cutlet.

941
01:11:04.464 --> 01:11:07.063 line:82%
But mummy had given cutlet.
Sir, it's cutlet.

942
01:11:07.252 --> 01:11:08.571 line:82%
No, it has a sandwich in...

963
01:15:19.084 --> 01:15:21.523 line:82%
"sometimes this and
sometimes that."

964
01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:25.083 line:82%
"I say as I please.
Tell me, isn't it?"

965
01:15:26.524 --> 01:15:30.922 line:82%
"Say whatever you please.
What is it that is impossible?"

966
01:15:31.244 --> 01:15:33.163 line:82%
"You should always keep
smiling and stay happy."

967
01:15:33.244 --> 01:15:35.403 line:82%
"Whatever you wish, will happen."

968
01:15:35.723 --> 01:15:40.723 line:82%
"Nobody does it better.
No, no, no, no, no, no."

969

973
01:15:59.003 --> 01:16:00.043 line:82%
"Who's the man? I am the man."

974
01:16:00.124 --> 01:16:01.162 line:82%
- "Who's the man?
- You're the man."

975
01:16:01.324 --> 01:16:03.442 line:82%
"I do the hip-hop like nobody can."

976
01:16:03.604 --> 01:16:04.843 line:82%
"I can make the party rock."

977
01:16:04.924 --> 01:16:06.043 line:82%

but are kind at heart."

984
01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:31.762 line:82%
"it's true that you
are truthful, my dear."

985
01:16:33.563 --> 01:16:37.762 line:82%
"I just want to say
that always be with me."

986
01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:42.363 line:82%

01:17:01.364 --> 01:17:05.842 line:82%
"Nobody does it better.
Better. No, no, no, no, no, no."

"Nobody does it better.
No, no, no, no, no, no."

992
01:17:10.523 --> 01:17:15.202 line:82%
"Nobody does it better.
Better. No, no, no, no, no, no."

993
01:17:15.284 --> 01:17:24.202 line:82%
"Nobody does it better.
No, no, no, no, no, no."

994
01:17:24.524 --> 01:17:29.482 line:82%

1001
01:17:53.484 --> 01:17:56.443 line:82%
- Sir, Jojo is my son, sir... Ma'am, Jojo is my son.
- Okay.

1002
01:17:56.523 --> 01:17:57.563 line:82%
Okay. Okay, fine.

1003
01:17:57.644 --> 01:17:59.483 line:82%
What happened? Your
angel didn't come today?

1004
01:17:59.823 --> 01:18:01.982 line:82%
Never mind. Try in the next race.

1005
01:18:14.864 --> 01:18:16.103 line:82%
Banku. Banku. Banku. Banku.

1006
01:18:16.184 --> 01:18:18.542 line:82%

1007
01:18:19.224 --> 01:18:21.983 line:82%
- The winner is Jojo.
- Yes.

1008
01:18:23.504 --> 01:18:26.543 line:82%
Yes. Jojo. My son
has come first again.

1009
01:18:26.624 --> 01:18:27.662 line:82%
My son comes first in studies and...

1010
01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:28.943 line:82%
he comes first in sports, too.

1011
01:18:29.024 --> 01:18:31.742 line:82%
And now the most
eagerly awaited. Hurdle race.

1012
01:18:32.144 --> 01:18:35.143 line:82%
The child who wins the hurdle
race will get an A-one cycle.

1013
01:18:36.303 --> 01:18:39.662 line:82%
You'll see, sir. My Jojo will
surely win this A-one cycle.

1014
01:18:39.921 --> 01:18:40.960 line:82%
Yes.

1015
01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.600 line:82%
See, Bhootnath,
I am losing all the races.

1016
01:18:43.983 --> 01:18:45.452 line:82%
Yes, so go and run faster.

1017
01:18:45.522 --> 01:18:47.561 line:82%
No, do some magic so
that I can defeat Jojo.

1018
01:18:47.784 --> 01:18:51.048 line:82%
No. No cheating in sports.
You just run faster. Come on.

1019
01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.894 line:82%
Didn't you see how many
hurdles are here. I won't run.

1020
01:18:54.944 --> 01:18:58.142 line:82%
Hey, Banku, have you ever seen an ant?

1021
01:18:58.383 --> 01:18:59.743 line:82%
- Ant?
- Yes, ant.

1022
01:19:01.464 --> 01:19:04.382 line:82%
If you keep a hurdle in front
of an ant, what does she do?

1023
01:19:04.464 --> 01:19:05.582 line:82%
She goes around it.

1024
01:19:05.664 --> 01:19:06.623 line:82%
Absolutely right.
After leaving from there...

1025
01:19:06.704 --> 01:19:09.143 line:82%
if you keep another hurdle,
then what does she do?

1026
01:19:09.224 --> 01:19:10.663 line:82%
- She again goes around it.
- That's it.

1027
01:19:11.184 --> 01:19:15.343 line:82%
If a little ant never gives up,
then my Banku is a big boy.

1028
01:19:15.423 --> 01:19:16.463 line:82%
How can he give up?

1029
01:19:16.863 --> 01:19:19.463 line:82%
You will win this hurdle race.
But with your hard work.

1030
01:19:19.784 --> 01:19:22.223 line:82%
There is no magic in life,
it's only hard work.

1031
01:19:22.304 --> 01:19:23.383 line:82%
- It's only hard work.
- Okay.

1032
01:19:23.463 --> 01:19:26.503 line:82%
Now go and win this
hurdle race. Come on.

1033
01:20:07.743 --> 01:20:08.783 line:82%
Jojo. Jojo. Jojo. Jojo.

1034
01:20:09.744 --> 01:20:13.103 line:82%
And the hurdle race winner is Banku.

1035
01:20:14.864 --> 01:20:16.063 line:82%
Yes.

1036
01:20:29.184 --> 01:20:30.782 line:82%
Hey, this is really deep.

1037
01:20:30.864 --> 01:20:32.702 line:82%
Yes, that's right.
It's really deep.

1038
01:20:32.784 --> 01:20:35.303 line:82%
Only then we'll know for
sure if he has an angel or not.

1039
01:20:35.384 --> 01:20:36.863 line:82%
He thinks of himself as a champion...

1040
01:20:36.944 --> 01:20:38.143 line:82%
just because he got a bicycle.

1041
01:20:38.264 --> 01:20:39.583 line:82%
- Come on, hurry up.
- Yes. Yes.

1042
01:20:39.663 --> 01:20:40.703 line:82%
- Cover it up. Banku shouldn't be able...
- Come on. Come on.

1043
01:20:40.784 --> 01:20:41.983 line:82%
To see this well.

1044
01:20:45.504 --> 01:20:46.543 line:82%
Jojo.

1045
01:20:47.184 --> 01:20:48.223 line:82%
Hey, he has fallen in there.

1046
01:20:48.934 --> 01:20:52.852 line:82%
Rahul. Sonu, help me.

1047
01:20:55.904 --> 01:20:57.103 line:82%
How can you run away
leaving me like that?

1048
01:20:57.184 --> 01:20:58.783 line:82%
Rahul. Sonu.

1049
01:20:59.264 --> 01:21:01.143 line:82%
- Jojo?
- Get me out.

1050
01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:02.740 line:82%
Where are you going
leaving me like that?

1051
01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:04.951 line:82%
But, Jojo, where are you?

1052
01:21:04.991 --> 01:21:08.029 line:82%
Banku, here, in the well.
I am in the well.

1053
01:21:09.503 --> 01:21:12.142 line:82%
- What are you doing here?
- I fell.

1054
01:21:12.619 --> 01:21:16.146 line:82%
How will you come out now?
Okay, fine I will bring your mummy.

1055
01:21:16.213 --> 01:21:20.444 line:82%
- No, no, my mom will kill me.
- So how will you get out?

1056
01:21:20.644 --> 01:21:24.363 line:82%
- Ask your angel to help me.
- But he will be at home.

1057
01:21:24.744 --> 01:21:25.782 line:82%
You're too much, Jojo.

1058
01:21:25.864 --> 01:21:26.829 line:82%
You should watch where you are going.

1059
01:21:26.854 --> 01:21:28.374 line:82%
Banku, shall I tell you something?

1060
01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:30.102 line:82%
Please don't get angry with me.

1061
01:21:31.524 --> 01:21:34.163 line:82%
Actually I was going to
make you fall in here...

1062
01:21:34.417 --> 01:21:38.095 line:82%
so that we'll know if
you have an angel or not.

1063
01:21:38.198 --> 01:21:39.997 line:82%
Okay then just lie where you are.

1064
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:42.330 line:82%
- Banku, listen to me, please.
- Bhootnath.

1065
01:21:43.203 --> 01:21:46.243 line:82%
What happened, Banku?
Did your friend fall in?

1066
01:21:46.323 --> 01:21:47.363 line:82%
He is not my friend.

1067
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.460 line:82%
He was trying to make me fall there...

1068
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:50.829 line:82%
but he fell there instead.
It's good.

1069
01:21:51.264 --> 01:21:53.862 line:82%
No, no. Banku, don't say that.
He is your friend.

1070
01:21:54.103 --> 01:21:56.943 line:82%
Banku, sorry, please, get me out.

1071
01:21:57.024 --> 01:21:58.583 line:82%
See, your friend is saying
sorry to you. Forgive him.

1072
01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.143 line:82%
Banku, learn to forgive.

1073
01:22:03.263 --> 01:22:05.943 line:82%
Doesn't your mom forgive
you when you pull a prank?

1074
01:22:06.324 --> 01:22:08.402 line:82%
She does, doesn't she?
You also forgive him.

1075
01:22:09.123 --> 01:22:10.643 line:82%
Okay, what did you do when you...

1076
01:22:10.724 --> 01:22:12.482 line:82%
befriended Jojo for the
first time. What did you do?

1077
01:22:13.683 --> 01:22:15.842 line:82%
Did a handshake.
I put forward my hand.

1078
01:22:16.083 --> 01:22:18.403 line:82%
You did, didn't you? So go
and put forward your hand.

1079
01:22:18.723 --> 01:22:20.003 line:82%
- Come here.
- What's the matter?

1080
01:22:20.084 --> 01:22:22.523 line:82%
Look at this, Bhootnath.
Look how deep this well is.

1081
01:22:22.764 --> 01:22:23.843 line:82%
How will my hand reach there?

1082
01:22:24.324 --> 01:22:25.363 line:82%
It will reach, just put it forward.

1083
01:22:25.984 --> 01:22:27.903 line:82%
- It won't.
- Do it. Do it. Lt will.

1084
01:22:29.564 --> 01:22:31.363 line:82%
Banku, why are you
showing me your hand?

1085
01:22:31.543 --> 01:22:34.223 line:82%
Go and get a rope, you think
your hand will reach here?

1086
01:22:39.843 --> 01:22:41.923 line:82%
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

1087
01:22:42.804 --> 01:22:44.323 line:82%
What are you doing, Banku?

1088
01:22:44.403 --> 01:22:45.842 line:82%
- Take it back. Take it back.
- Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

1089
01:22:45.924 --> 01:22:46.963 line:82%
Give me your hand.

1090
01:22:50.163 --> 01:22:51.203 line:82%
Don't be afraid, come.

1091
01:22:59.804 --> 01:23:00.842 line:82%
How did you do that?

1092
01:23:01.284 --> 01:23:03.002 line:82%
Now you believe that I have an angel.

1093
01:23:04.004 --> 01:23:05.522 line:82%
But don't tell anyone about it.

1094
01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:10.363 line:82%
- Good. Good.
- Sir, it's confirmed news.

1095
01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:12.434 line:82%
Banku really has got an angel.

1096
01:23:13.323 --> 01:23:15.482 line:82%
- But don't tell anyone.
- Yes. What?

1097
01:23:16.644 --> 01:23:19.049 line:82%
I have seen a lot of
mischievous boys...

1098
01:23:19.305 --> 01:23:22.383 line:82%
but not a story-teller like him.

1099
01:23:23.043 --> 01:23:24.083 line:82%
Do you know what does the entire...

1100
01:23:24.164 --> 01:23:25.442 line:82%
school learn these days?

1101
01:23:26.724 --> 01:23:29.000 line:82%
Banku and angel's stories.

1102
01:23:29.643 --> 01:23:33.043 line:82%
Look, Mrs. Sharma, if you want
to spoil your son, then do it.

1103
01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:35.943 line:82%
But the other kids are
my responsibility, too.

1104
01:23:36.024 --> 01:23:38.103 line:82%
- Yes. Yes, sir.
- This is the final warning.

1105
01:23:38.643 --> 01:23:42.002 line:82%
Or else please enroll your
son in some other school.

1106
01:23:51.384 --> 01:23:53.223 line:82%
Why do you need to
tell those fake stories?

1107
01:23:53.604 --> 01:23:54.883 line:82%
They're not untrue, they're true.

1108
01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.203 line:82%
What's true?

1109
01:23:56.643 --> 01:23:59.683 line:82%
Have you seen an angel? Okay.

1110
01:24:00.583 --> 01:24:03.222 line:82%
If you have seen angel, then
you must have seen a ghost, too.

1111
01:24:03.864 --> 01:24:06.983 line:82%
No, ghosts don't exist,
didn't you tell me that?

1112
01:24:08.363 --> 01:24:11.203 line:82%
- Even angels don't exist.
- They do exist.

1113
01:24:18.044 --> 01:24:20.843 line:82%
- Whom are you trying to signal here?
- Angel.

1114
01:24:21.764 --> 01:24:23.853 line:82%
What is it? Where is angel?

1115
01:24:24.304 --> 01:24:25.917 line:82%
Right here. Angel, come here.

1116
01:24:26.226 --> 01:24:28.562 line:82%
- Banku, what are you trying get at?
- Please, come right here.

1117
01:24:30.164 --> 01:24:31.603 line:82%
Please, angel, come.
Mummy won't listen to me.

1118
01:24:31.683 --> 01:24:32.723 line:82%
Banku, listen to me.

1119
01:24:33.123 --> 01:24:35.282 line:82%
I am requesting angel
to appear before me.

1120
01:24:35.364 --> 01:24:36.923 line:82%
Stop that nonsense at once, Banku.

1121
01:24:44.084 --> 01:24:47.522 line:82%
Go to your room.
Enough with your jokes.

1122
01:24:49.443 --> 01:24:53.683 line:82%
Does one need to hit a
child like this? Banku...

1123
01:25:14.603 --> 01:25:26.203 line:82%
"Come on, leave it, just forget it."

1124
01:25:26.783 --> 01:25:29.662 line:82%
"Why do you get so angry?"

1125
01:25:29.844 --> 01:25:35.162 line:82%
"Say something to me
and listen to me."

1126
01:25:35.844 --> 01:25:41.363 line:82%
"Why keep quiet and
dishearten ourselves?"

1127
01:25:41.884 --> 01:25:53.403 line:82%
"Come on, leave it, just forget it."

1128
01:26:24.723 --> 01:26:30.722 line:82%
"If you get angry with me,
then with whom will I talk?"

1129
01:26:33.764 --> 01:26:36.722 line:82%
"I enlivened again when I met you."

1130
01:26:36.804 --> 01:26:39.643 line:82%
"I exist because of you."

1131
01:26:42.843 --> 01:26:48.482 line:82%
"If you get angry with me,
then with whom will I talk?"

1132
01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:51.942 line:82%
"I enlivened again when I met you."

1133
01:26:52.024 --> 01:26:54.582 line:82%
"I exist because of you."

1134
01:26:55.303 --> 01:27:00.582 line:82%
"You're angry at the moment,
but still you're mine."

1135
01:27:00.723 --> 01:27:06.403 line:82%
"Look, it's not good
to be angry like this."

1136
01:27:06.723 --> 01:27:18.203 line:82%
"Come on, leave it, just forget it."

1137
01:27:43.484 --> 01:27:49.043 line:82%
"My darling son. My little prince."

1138
01:27:52.604 --> 01:27:55.523 line:82%
"Don't get so angry at me."

1139
01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:58.363 line:82%
"Don't punish me like this."

1140
01:28:01.683 --> 01:28:07.163 line:82%
"My darling son. My little prince."

1141
01:28:07.844 --> 01:28:10.483 line:82%
"Don't get so angry at me."

1142
01:28:10.563 --> 01:28:13.363 line:82%
"Don't punish me like this."

1143
01:28:13.978 --> 01:28:19.418 line:82%
"Look, how I long to
take you in my arms."

1144
01:28:19.543 --> 01:28:25.062 line:82%
"Come, let me shower you
with love, let's stop fighting."

1145
01:28:25.643 --> 01:28:31.174 line:82%
"Come on, leave it, just forget it."

1146
01:28:31.724 --> 01:28:34.923 line:82%
"Why do you get so angry?"

1147
01:28:35.003 --> 01:28:40.203 line:82%
"Say something to me
and listen to me."

1148
01:28:40.703 --> 01:28:46.303 line:82%
"Why keep quiet and
dishearten ourselves?"

1149
01:28:46.844 --> 01:28:52.402 line:82%
"Come on, leave it, just forget it."

1150
01:28:52.924 --> 01:28:58.402 line:82%
- "Come on, leave it.
- Just forget it."

1151
01:29:13.244 --> 01:29:17.923 line:82%
Bhootnath. Bhootnath.

1152
01:29:30.884 --> 01:29:36.563 line:82%
Bhootnath, see that star
over there? That's my grandpa.

1153
01:29:38.724 --> 01:29:40.003 line:82%
He left me.

1154
01:29:43.203 --> 01:29:44.803 line:82%
He didn't leave you,
he is watching over you.

1155
01:29:47.324 --> 01:29:51.002 line:82%
Your grandpa misses you a
lot and he loves you a lot.

1156
01:29:52.803 --> 01:29:53.843 line:82%
- Really?
- Yes.

1157
01:29:55.604 --> 01:29:59.123 line:82%
Bhootnath, when you weren't there...

1158
01:29:59.204 --> 01:30:02.083 line:82%
I used to miss him a lot.

1159
01:30:03.684 --> 01:30:10.043 line:82%
And when you weren't
talking to me... Even I was...

1160
01:30:14.883 --> 01:30:18.602 line:82%
But you won't leave me
like my grandpa, would you?

1161
01:30:22.563 --> 01:30:28.123 line:82%
No, never. You're everything
to me. How can I leave you?

1162
01:30:28.644 --> 01:30:30.482 line:82%
Then come for the fancy
dress tomorrow for sure.

1163
01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:34.562 line:82%
- There is a surprise for you.
- Surprise? What surprise?

1164
01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:50.963 line:82%
You hid the bowl, didn't you?

1165
01:30:53.283 --> 01:30:54.962 line:82%
You're here to steal the ice-cream?

1166
01:30:57.363 --> 01:31:01.003 line:82%
Okay, you're Anthony
whom my mummy had beaten up.

1167
01:31:04.884 --> 01:31:05.923 line:82%
I am a ghost.

1168
01:31:08.324 --> 01:31:11.123 line:82%
Ghosts don't exist.
Mummy had told me...

1169
01:31:11.204 --> 01:31:14.723 line:82%
that angels exist.
Okay, so are you an angel?

1170
01:31:15.044 --> 01:31:16.082 line:82%
I said I am a ghost.

1171
01:31:16.164 --> 01:31:17.323 line:82%
I said ghosts don't exist.

1172
01:31:18.003 --> 01:31:19.003 line:82%
- This is my house.
- Anjali.

1173
01:31:20.163 --> 01:31:21.203 line:82%
This is our house.

1174
01:31:21.284 --> 01:31:22.843 line:82%
He has worn clothes just like
uncle Kailash Nath.

1175
01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.563 line:82%
Who is uncle Kailash Nath?

1176
01:31:25.604 --> 01:31:27.083 line:82%
The place where you
stay belongs to him.

1177
01:31:27.684 --> 01:31:29.843 line:82%
And his ghost stories are quite famous.

1178
01:31:41.484 --> 01:31:43.202 line:82%
I am a ghost.

1179
01:31:45.764 --> 01:31:47.522 line:82%
'Do you know an angel
stays in our house with us?'

1180
01:31:50.244 --> 01:31:53.162 line:82%
'Mama, there is not even
a single photo of angel.'

1181
01:31:56.484 --> 01:31:59.123 line:82%
'I am requesting angel
to appear before you.'

1182
01:32:40.484 --> 01:32:41.522 line:82%
Kailash Nath?

1183
01:32:43.044 --> 01:32:44.522 line:82%
Kailash Nath is my father's name.

1184
01:32:45.284 --> 01:32:46.963 line:82%
- Nath Villa is named after him.
- Oh, I see.

1185
01:32:47.323 --> 01:32:49.936 line:82%
- Oh, is that you, Mr. Vijay?
- How are you, Jagan?

1186
01:32:50.184 --> 01:32:51.462 line:82%
I am fine with God's grace.

1187
01:32:51.544 --> 01:32:52.623 line:82%
You were supposed to come tomorrow.

1188
01:32:52.964 --> 01:32:54.362 line:82%
I would have come to receive you,
if you had called me.

1189
01:32:55.084 --> 01:32:57.282 line:82%
He is Jagan. He has been
taking care of the property here.

1190
01:32:57.764 --> 01:32:59.762 line:82%
- Greetings.
- Jagan, this is Mr. Sanjay Malhotra.

1191
01:33:00.203 --> 01:33:03.330 line:82%
He owns lot of big resorts.
He wants to see Nath Villa.

1192
01:33:03.524 --> 01:33:05.762 line:82%
Oh, not just want to see,
I want to buy it.

1193
01:33:07.124 --> 01:33:08.162 line:82%
What does he mean?

1194
01:33:08.565 --> 01:33:10.805 line:82%
That's what I wanted to tell you.
A family stays here now.

1195
01:33:11.064 --> 01:33:13.675 line:82%
- It doesn't matter, show him around.
- What about the family?

1196
01:33:13.803 --> 01:33:14.963 line:82%
Hey, if I like it,
then we'll arrange...

1197
01:33:15.044 --> 01:33:17.483 line:82%
the family somewhere else.

1198
01:33:18.084 --> 01:33:19.123 line:82%
- Right, Vijay?
- Correct.

1199
01:33:26.637 --> 01:33:27.677 line:82%
Who are you?

1200
01:33:27.805 --> 01:33:28.843 line:82%
Is there any elder in this family?

1201
01:33:31.143 --> 01:33:32.051 line:82%
Yes?

1202
01:33:32.164 --> 01:33:34.589 line:82%
Mr. Vijay Nath has sent us.
He is Mr. Sanjay Malhotra.

1203
01:33:34.899 --> 01:33:37.538 line:82%
We want to see the site.
We are buying this villa.

1204
01:33:40.463 --> 01:33:42.783 line:82%
You can't see this
house without permission.

1205
01:33:42.863 --> 01:33:44.383 line:82%
Ma'am, Mr. Vijay Nath has
given us the permission.

1206
01:33:44.923 --> 01:33:46.043 line:82%
I want to talk to Jagan.

1207
01:33:46.123 --> 01:33:47.243 line:82%
Jagan himself has dropped us here.

1208
01:33:47.644 --> 01:33:49.722 line:82%
But we own this house for a year.

1209
01:33:50.064 --> 01:33:52.272 line:82%
My husband's company
has allotted it to us.

1210
01:33:53.904 --> 01:33:57.263 line:82%
Hey. No one can touch my house.

1211
01:34:02.524 --> 01:34:09.203 line:82%
Get out of here. Get
out of here. Get out.

1212
01:34:12.444 --> 01:34:15.162 line:82%
This is Kailash Nath's house
and not that of Vijay Nath.

1213
01:34:15.864 --> 01:34:21.343 line:82%
Get out. Come on, go.

1214
01:34:25.486 --> 01:34:26.526 line:82%
Bhootnath.

1215
01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:32.823 line:82%
Bhootnath, don't be scared.
Don't get angry.

1216
01:34:33.035 --> 01:34:34.075 line:82%
Please, Bhootnath.

1217
01:34:48.484 --> 01:34:49.522 line:82%
You people won't go anywhere.

1218
01:34:55.844 --> 01:34:58.816 line:82%
Angel, don't do this.
Mama is scared.

1219
01:35:03.409 --> 01:35:04.767 line:82%
Angel, don't get angry.

1220
01:35:05.663 --> 01:35:06.742 line:82%
You won't go anywhere from here.

1221
01:35:06.824 --> 01:35:08.743 line:82%
I will never leave you and go.

1222
01:35:08.902 --> 01:35:10.941 line:82%
Banku, whom are you talking to?

1223
01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:13.449 line:82%
To angel. He is angry.

1224
01:35:13.545 --> 01:35:15.303 line:82%
- What?
- Angel, please come to me.

1225
01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:50.659 line:82%
I am the Kailash Nath whom
the world calls a ghost.

1226
01:35:52.603 --> 01:35:56.363 line:82%
But your son thinks I am
an angel. This is my house.

1227
01:35:57.184 --> 01:36:04.063 line:82%
My... Nirmala's house.
She decorated it herself.

1228
01:36:06.744 --> 01:36:09.823 line:82%
She... She decorated each
and every corner herself.

1229
01:36:11.803 --> 01:36:16.962 line:82%
She... She... made this house
a home. She made it a home.

1230
01:36:18.944 --> 01:36:20.223 line:82%
We also had a family.

1231
01:36:23.704 --> 01:36:28.183 line:82%
Like your family, even we
had a small, happy family.

1232
01:36:31.763 --> 01:36:35.203 line:82%
My son Vijay, daughter-in-law Shana,
and my grandson...

1233
01:36:36.484 --> 01:36:41.962 line:82%
Vibhut, who was just like your son.

1234
01:36:44.443 --> 01:36:52.043 line:82%
Vijay left. He went abroad,
leaving his house.

1235
01:36:56.524 --> 01:36:57.562 line:82%
Bless you.

1236
01:36:58.883 --> 01:37:00.603 line:82%
Mother, I don't feel like going at all.

1237
01:37:00.683 --> 01:37:02.002 line:82%
Then don't go, Son.

1238
01:37:02.084 --> 01:37:04.083 line:82%
What are you saying? He is
going to take the first step.

1239
01:37:04.163 --> 01:37:05.763 line:82%
You shouldn't interrupt
like that. Come, Son, come.

1240
01:37:07.124 --> 01:37:12.682 line:82%
He settled over there,
leaving us alone.

1241
01:37:16.023 --> 01:37:18.263 line:82%
His mother was longing to see him.

1242
01:37:18.344 --> 01:37:21.823 line:82%
Here. She used to sit here
all day long and wait for him.

1243
01:37:32.343 --> 01:37:33.782 line:82%
Yes, Father, did you
get the cheque on time?

1244
01:37:34.677 --> 01:37:38.516 line:82%
Dear, I get the cheque
on time, but not you.

1245
01:37:38.826 --> 01:37:41.185 line:82%
I am trying. The
conference is in Mumbai this time.

1246
01:37:41.624 --> 01:37:42.782 line:82%
If I come to Mumbai, I
will surely come to Goa.

1247
01:37:45.624 --> 01:37:47.303 line:82%
Son, if you happen to come,
tell mother that...

1248
01:37:47.384 --> 01:37:48.422 line:82%
you have come to meet her.

1249
01:37:49.623 --> 01:37:50.863 line:82%
Don't tell her about the conference.

1250
01:37:52.424 --> 01:37:55.382 line:82%
Okay, listen, I am...
taking this phone to mother.

1251
01:37:55.823 --> 01:37:57.742 line:82%
Talk to her as well, okay?

1252
01:38:06.584 --> 01:38:07.622 line:82%
He must have forgotten.

1253
01:38:11.843 --> 01:38:14.403 line:82%
No, sometimes there is a
problem in the connection.

1254
01:38:15.944 --> 01:38:17.222 line:82%
As it is, America is so far.

1255
01:38:19.918 --> 01:38:22.476 line:82%
Our son has gone away from us.

1256
01:38:26.025 --> 01:38:27.545 line:82%
First he used to come running...

1257
01:38:28.735 --> 01:38:31.014 line:82%
when we used to call him just once.

1258
01:38:38.324 --> 01:38:42.963 line:82%
And Nirmala passed away,
waiting for her son.

1259
01:38:44.812 --> 01:38:46.410 line:82%
She left me alone.

1260
01:38:49.043 --> 01:38:50.323 line:82%
And your son didn't come?

1261
01:38:56.963 --> 01:38:58.003 line:82%
He did come.

1262
01:39:07.283 --> 01:39:08.323 line:82%
Father, I...

1263
01:39:16.144 --> 01:39:19.103 line:82%
Father... Father, I am sorry.
Father...

1264
01:39:22.986 --> 01:39:24.026 line:82%
Sorry, Father.

1265
01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.679 line:82%
You are too late, Son.

1266
01:39:43.739 --> 01:39:46.858 line:82%
I am sorry, Father. I am sorry.

1267
01:39:53.903 --> 01:39:55.822 line:82%
Look at that.
Do you see that star?

1268
01:39:55.904 --> 01:39:57.183 line:82%
- That one?
- Yes.

1269
01:39:57.503 --> 01:39:59.623 line:82%
- Is that grandma?
- Yes.

1270
01:39:59.704 --> 01:40:01.855 line:82%
Wherever I go, will she be with me?

1271
01:40:01.996 --> 01:40:04.315 line:82%
Yes. Wherever you go,
grandma will be with you.

1272
01:40:04.424 --> 01:40:06.583 line:82%
Grandma, now I won't go anywhere.

1273
01:40:06.663 --> 01:40:09.463 line:82%
Grandpa, now I'll be
with you over here.

1274
01:40:09.543 --> 01:40:11.942 line:82%
I won't let you go anywhere.
Hey. Catch him.

1275
01:40:12.024 --> 01:40:13.622 line:82%
Catch him. Catch him. Catch him.

1276
01:40:16.291 --> 01:40:18.129 line:82%
So this is the house, Mr. Pradhan.

1277
01:40:18.744 --> 01:40:21.182 line:82%
It's huge and very well constructed.

1278
01:40:21.804 --> 01:40:25.083 line:82%
Oh, yes. And you don't
have to make a lot of changes.

1279
01:40:25.288 --> 01:40:26.527 line:82%
What's upstairs?

1280
01:40:26.844 --> 01:40:28.763 line:82%
It's the terrace. Come, let's see.

1281
01:40:28.843 --> 01:40:29.883 line:82%
Come, come, come. We've come home.

1282
01:40:29.964 --> 01:40:31.002 line:82%
We've come home. We've...

1283
01:40:38.044 --> 01:40:39.402 line:82%
Meet my father. Mr. Kailash Nath.

1284
01:40:41.723 --> 01:40:45.043 line:82%
Father, this is Mr. Pradhan.
He owns a resort business.

1285
01:40:46.084 --> 01:40:47.523 line:82%
He is buying our house.

1286
01:40:48.323 --> 01:40:49.843 line:82%
We have already bought it,
Mr. Kailash Nath.

1287
01:40:50.636 --> 01:40:53.074 line:82%
Actually we are just
finishing the paper work tomorrow.

1288
01:40:53.952 --> 01:40:55.832 line:82%
Excuse me, Mr. Pradhan, but
this house is not for sale.

1289
01:40:57.524 --> 01:40:59.283 line:82%
But Vijay told me that...

1290
01:40:59.363 --> 01:41:01.123 line:82%
He is still a child.
It's not he who will decide...

1291
01:41:01.204 --> 01:41:02.883 line:82%
what has to be done with this house.

1292
01:41:03.643 --> 01:41:04.683 line:82%
Vijay, what is this?

1293
01:41:04.843 --> 01:41:05.963 line:82%
I am very sorry, Mr. Pradhan.

1294
01:41:06.094 --> 01:41:08.332 line:82%
You keep the papers ready.
We'll talk tomorrow.

1295
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:09.949 line:82%
This house won't be sold.
Didn't you hear that?

1296
01:41:20.203 --> 01:41:22.362 line:82%
I had great difficulty in getting
such a nice price. And you...

1297
01:41:24.763 --> 01:41:26.123 line:82%
You are selling your house?

1298
01:41:26.327 --> 01:41:27.727 line:82%
What? What's so special
about this house, Father?

1299
01:41:29.326 --> 01:41:30.365 line:82%
What's so special about this house?

1300
01:41:34.925 --> 01:41:36.244 line:82%
You're asking me what's so
special about this house?

1301
01:41:39.163 --> 01:41:40.763 line:82%
You've spent your
childhood in this house.

1302
01:41:42.283 --> 01:41:43.563 line:82%
The first time you came
into your mother's lap...

1303
01:41:43.644 --> 01:41:45.483 line:82%
in this house...

1304
01:41:46.313 --> 01:41:48.551 line:82%
your mother's
happiness resides in this house.

1305
01:41:49.084 --> 01:41:52.602 line:82%
When you started to walk,
her... her smile...

1306
01:41:54.004 --> 01:41:55.162 line:82%
and when you used to fall sick...

1307
01:41:55.924 --> 01:41:57.763 line:82%
your mother used to
stay awake all night...

1308
01:41:57.844 --> 01:42:00.562 line:82%
and look after you.
That worry resides in this house.

1309
01:42:06.164 --> 01:42:10.162 line:82%
And when she fell sick and
was breathing her last...

1310
01:42:11.584 --> 01:42:14.023 line:82%
she was waiting for
her son to come home...

1311
01:42:14.104 --> 01:42:15.262 line:82%
that longing resides in this house.

1312
01:42:16.064 --> 01:42:18.063 line:82%
Father, you don't understand.

1313
01:42:19.084 --> 01:42:20.243 line:82%
All of us will go back to America.

1314
01:42:21.143 --> 01:42:23.583 line:82%
And then who's going to
look after such a big house?

1315
01:42:24.124 --> 01:42:24.831 line:82%
Let's sell it.

1316
01:42:24.856 --> 01:42:26.963 line:82%
Why should we sell it? All
of us will stay here together.

1317
01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:28.602 line:82%
No, Father, I can't stay here.

1318
01:42:28.764 --> 01:42:30.282 line:82%
And I can't even come back
from there every now and then.

1319
01:42:30.537 --> 01:42:32.283 line:82%
My work suffers,
Vibhut's studies suffer.

1320
01:42:32.364 --> 01:42:33.483 line:82%
And if he has to stay here...

1321
01:42:33.564 --> 01:42:34.803 line:82%
then why did you send him abroad?

1322
01:42:37.403 --> 01:42:41.443 line:82%
I sent him to study and
not to settle over there.

1323
01:42:42.744 --> 01:42:46.223 line:82%
Father, then come to America with us.

1324
01:42:47.124 --> 01:42:48.162 line:82%
There's nothing left here now.

1325
01:42:48.723 --> 01:42:50.483 line:82%
And anyway, what
will you do here alone?

1326
01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:51.683 line:82%
Even mother is no more now.

1327
01:42:55.604 --> 01:42:56.923 line:82%
Mother hasn't gone anywhere, Son.

1328
01:42:58.323 --> 01:43:01.682 line:82%
She is over here, in this very house.
She's listening to you.

1329
01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:10.163 line:82%
You go. Go and do your work.
I'll stay here and wonder...

1330
01:43:10.916 --> 01:43:16.915 line:82%
where I went wrong in nurturing you.

1331
01:43:26.124 --> 01:43:27.923 line:82%
This is really humiliating.

1332
01:43:28.184 --> 01:43:30.422 line:82%
I mean, do you have any
right on this house or not?

1333
01:43:32.184 --> 01:43:35.822 line:82%
I am sorry, Vijay, but I
can't stay here anymore.

1334
01:43:37.583 --> 01:43:40.263 line:82%
And no need to take him to America.

1335
01:43:41.624 --> 01:43:43.382 line:82%
He is not coming with us to America.

1336
01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:52.222 line:82%
Papa, I won't go.

1337
01:44:21.704 --> 01:44:22.742 line:82%
Father.

1338
01:44:28.983 --> 01:44:30.023 line:82%
Father, I...

1339
01:44:32.064 --> 01:44:35.063 line:82%
Never mind, dear.
People make mistakes.

1340
01:44:35.144 --> 01:44:36.782 line:82%
Every human makes mistakes.

1341
01:44:38.583 --> 01:44:40.423 line:82%
No, Father. We are going.

1342
01:44:42.744 --> 01:44:47.222 line:82%
You are going? What do
you mean by you are going?

1343
01:44:48.423 --> 01:44:49.903 line:82%
Father, we are going back to America.

1344
01:44:50.904 --> 01:44:52.502 line:82%
No, no, Vijay. Listen,
you... Where are you going?

1345
01:44:53.264 --> 01:44:55.022 line:82%
Father, you can come to
America whenever you want to.

1346
01:44:55.104 --> 01:44:56.623 line:82%
How... How will I
live without all of you?

1347
01:44:56.703 --> 01:44:57.782 line:82%
I'll keep sending you
the cheques every month.

1348
01:44:57.864 --> 01:44:58.903 line:82%
Vijay, listen to me.

1349
01:44:58.983 --> 01:45:00.023 line:82%
Grandpa, I won't go.

1350
01:45:00.104 --> 01:45:01.943 line:82%
No, dear. We won't
go anywhere. Nowhere.

1351
01:45:02.424 --> 01:45:04.022 line:82%
Daughter-in-law,
keep the luggage back.

1352
01:45:04.784 --> 01:45:06.343 line:82%
Vibhut, come on. Come down.

1353
01:45:06.423 --> 01:45:07.783 line:82%
No. I won't go.

1354
01:45:07.963 --> 01:45:09.083 line:82%
I said come down.

1355
01:45:09.163 --> 01:45:12.083 line:82%
- Vijay. - Vibhut, come here, Son.
Vibhut, come here.

1356
01:45:12.163 --> 01:45:14.763 line:82%
No, Vijay, if you can't
live without your son...

1357
01:45:14.844 --> 01:45:18.683 line:82%
then even I can't live
without my son. Don't go, Vijay.

1358
01:45:19.003 --> 01:45:20.043 line:82%
Don't go.

1359
01:45:35.004 --> 01:45:36.042 line:82%
What are you doing, Daughter-in-law?

1360
01:45:36.283 --> 01:45:39.443 line:82%
Grandpa, I won't go. Grandpa,
I won't go.

1361
01:45:39.523 --> 01:45:42.683 line:82%
Grandpa, I won't go.

1362
01:46:16.924 --> 01:46:17.963 line:82%
Vijay.

1363
01:46:28.163 --> 01:46:34.483 line:82%
Vijay. Vijay. Vijay.
Vijay, don't go, Vijay. Vijay.

1364
01:46:36.563 --> 01:46:41.362 line:82%
Vijay. Vijay. Vijay. Vijay.
Vijay. Vijay.

1365
01:46:42.944 --> 01:46:49.942 line:82%
Vijay, don't...
leave me and go, Vijay.

1366
01:48:10.843 --> 01:48:16.203 line:82%
I was lying right here,
but he didn't turn around...

1367
01:48:17.237 --> 01:48:23.156 line:82%
and see me even once.
Not even once.

1368
01:48:26.003 --> 01:48:28.683 line:82%
Since then, I've been
wandering in this... this house.

1369
01:48:30.333 --> 01:48:33.452 line:82%
I never allowed anyone
to live in this house.

1370
01:48:38.169 --> 01:48:45.047 line:82%
Then he came. My angel.

1371
01:48:48.497 --> 01:48:49.643 line:82%
He changed me.

1372
01:48:52.664 --> 01:48:54.023 line:82%
I forgot that I'm not alive.

1373
01:48:57.063 --> 01:48:58.262 line:82%
Does it hurt now?

1374
01:49:00.984 --> 01:49:05.222 line:82%
No, dear, it doesn't hurt now.

1375
01:49:06.924 --> 01:49:09.443 line:82%
How long will you keep
wandering like that?

1376
01:49:12.024 --> 01:49:13.982 line:82%
Why don't you forgive your son?

1377
01:49:14.144 --> 01:49:19.382 line:82%
No. Never. I won't forgive him.

1378
01:49:24.004 --> 01:49:27.483 line:82%
He left me, but I will never
leave this house. I won't.

1379
01:49:29.104 --> 01:49:31.023 line:82%
Even if I have to wander
here for the next 100 lives.

1380
01:49:33.403 --> 01:49:39.642 line:82%
100 lives. Now only you
people will live in this house.

1381
01:49:44.284 --> 01:49:49.083 line:82%
Banku will stay here, forever.

1382
01:49:51.164 --> 01:49:53.282 line:82%
You people can't leave
this place. No.

1383
01:49:54.003 --> 01:49:55.123 line:82%
You people can't go.

1384
01:50:13.823 --> 01:50:16.623 line:82%
Is he still here?

1385
01:50:19.444 --> 01:50:22.243 line:82%
So where is he right now?

1386
01:50:36.003 --> 01:50:38.162 line:82%
Kailash Nath used to love his son.

1387
01:50:39.303 --> 01:50:42.542 line:82%
He offered many prayers
for him in this temple.

1388
01:50:44.724 --> 01:50:47.522 line:82%
Now he has got attached to your son.

1389
01:50:47.884 --> 01:50:49.563 line:82%
Priest, that's what
we are fearing that...

1390
01:50:50.154 --> 01:50:52.043 line:82%
what if he does anything to Banku...

1391
01:50:52.123 --> 01:50:55.242 line:82%
Oh, no. No. Kailash has
never caused any harm to anyone.

1392
01:50:56.224 --> 01:50:57.343 line:82%
He won't do anything.

1393
01:50:57.743 --> 01:51:00.262 line:82%
Then what... What should we do now?

1394
01:51:00.704 --> 01:51:01.743 line:82%
Post death ceremony.

1395
01:51:03.303 --> 01:51:05.263 line:82%
We will have to do it for
his soul to rest in peace.

1396
01:51:05.864 --> 01:51:08.371 line:82%
But only his son can do that.

1397
01:51:09.004 --> 01:51:10.403 line:82%
Yes. He should be the one to do it.

1398
01:51:11.724 --> 01:51:13.563 line:82%
Anyway this rite
hasn't been performed...

1399
01:51:13.644 --> 01:51:16.083 line:82%
after Kailash's death.
Who would have done it?

1400
01:51:16.684 --> 01:51:17.723 line:82%
His son was abroad.

1401
01:51:18.564 --> 01:51:20.123 line:82%
Well, I have heard that
he is here these days.

1402
01:51:21.123 --> 01:51:24.242 line:82%
Then I will meet and talk to him.

1403
01:51:26.710 --> 01:51:29.029 line:82%
If you heed my advice then your son...

1404
01:51:29.204 --> 01:51:31.643 line:82%
can give Kailash his salvation.

1405
01:51:32.764 --> 01:51:34.203 line:82%
God answers to children's prayers.

1406
01:51:35.183 --> 01:51:37.423 line:82%
God will surely accept his prayers.

1407
01:51:45.983 --> 01:51:47.023 line:82%
Vijay...

1408
01:51:50.124 --> 01:51:51.162 line:82%
- Aditya.
- Hi.

1409
01:51:55.884 --> 01:51:57.522 line:82%
I always come here when I come to Goa.

1410
01:51:58.444 --> 01:52:00.123 line:82%
You come to Goa, but you don't go home.

1411
01:52:01.204 --> 01:52:02.243 line:82%
You stay there.

1412
01:52:03.382 --> 01:52:05.181 line:82%
And you want to throw us out of there.

1413
01:52:06.444 --> 01:52:07.523 line:82%
I am bringing down Nath Villa.

1414
01:52:08.883 --> 01:52:11.522 line:82%
This time I will sell the
land and leave Goa forever.

1415
01:52:12.863 --> 01:52:14.902 line:82%
No house, no ghost.

1416
01:52:16.943 --> 01:52:22.702 line:82%
Not a ghost, but a spirit.
A disgruntled spirit of your father.

1417
01:52:23.323 --> 01:52:25.883 line:82%
Disgruntled? Dissatisfied.

1418
01:52:27.271 --> 01:52:29.430 line:82%
Father has always been
dissatisfied with me.

1419
01:52:30.684 --> 01:52:31.803 line:82%
He could never understand me.

1420
01:52:31.984 --> 01:52:34.743 line:82%
Or perhaps you could
never understand him.

1421
01:52:36.364 --> 01:52:40.043 line:82%
Vijay, your father is
attached to that house.

1422
01:52:40.803 --> 01:52:43.043 line:82%
He doesn't want the house full of...

1423
01:52:43.124 --> 01:52:44.963 line:82%
your mother's
memories to be demolished.

1424
01:52:45.804 --> 01:52:48.843 line:82%
Perhaps that's why his
soul has still been wandering.

1425
01:52:50.444 --> 01:52:53.083 line:82%
Look, Aditya, I don't
believe in all this.

1426
01:52:54.064 --> 01:52:56.383 line:82%
And I find it really funny that...

1427
01:52:56.464 --> 01:52:58.957 line:82%
my father's soul
troubles everyone other than me.

1428
01:53:00.064 --> 01:53:03.823 line:82%
Doesn't trouble, just
gives a sense of his presence.

1429
01:53:04.749 --> 01:53:06.668 line:82%
You know a lot about my father.

1430
01:53:08.178 --> 01:53:09.698 line:82%
The day you were leaving the house...

1431
01:53:09.904 --> 01:53:12.022 line:82%
your father went
after his son to stop him.

1432
01:53:12.277 --> 01:53:13.756 line:82%
And he slipped and
fell down and maybe...

1433
01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:15.485 line:82%
maybe even screamed.

1434
01:53:16.784 --> 01:53:19.143 line:82%
But his son didn't turn
around and look at him even once.

1435
01:53:19.317 --> 01:53:21.596 line:82%
- That was an accident.
- That's what you think.

1436
01:53:21.774 --> 01:53:23.933 line:82%
What do you want to say?
I killed my father?

1437
01:53:24.464 --> 01:53:27.022 line:82%
You don't know anything.
I was not wrong.

1438
01:53:27.184 --> 01:53:28.743 line:82%
He couldn't even understand
such a small thing that I...

1439
01:53:28.823 --> 01:53:30.543 line:82%
Now you aren't able to
understand such a small thing.

1440
01:53:31.024 --> 01:53:33.583 line:82%
Vijay. Vijay, all you
need to do is apologize.

1441
01:53:33.804 --> 01:53:34.842 line:82%
That, too, to your father.

1442
01:53:35.344 --> 01:53:36.677 line:82%
Just come home and
apologize to him once.

1443
01:53:36.785 --> 01:53:38.224 line:82%
Maybe his soul will rest in peace.

1444
01:53:38.684 --> 01:53:40.683 line:82%
You have come to tell
me what I should do?

1445
01:53:40.796 --> 01:53:44.112 line:82%
No, I have come to
inform you that we have kept...

1446
01:53:44.377 --> 01:53:47.183 line:82%
veneration so that your
father's soul rests in peace.

1447
01:53:47.243 --> 01:53:49.762 line:82%
We are performing a
post death ceremony.

1448
01:53:49.844 --> 01:53:51.403 line:82%
Post death ceremonies
aren't performed in America...

1449
01:53:51.584 --> 01:53:53.263 line:82%
but people still attain salvation.

1450
01:53:54.524 --> 01:53:55.883 line:82%
A son performs this
rite for his father.

1451
01:53:56.283 --> 01:53:58.802 line:82%
Hey, so you do it.
Prayer veneration and all.

1452
01:53:58.884 --> 01:53:59.843 line:82%
Do as you please.

1453
01:54:00.324 --> 01:54:01.922 line:82%
I am coming to take the
house keys the next day.

1454
01:54:03.782 --> 01:54:08.637 line:82%
Okay, I will surely keep
some offerings for you.

1455
01:54:14.384 --> 01:54:16.063 line:82%
Anyway, Vijay, even I didn't
believe in all these things.

1456
01:54:17.743 --> 01:54:22.902 line:82%
But I agree that some things
are always left incomplete.

1457
01:54:25.164 --> 01:54:28.643 line:82%
This veneration, too, will
be incomplete without you.

1458
01:54:43.144 --> 01:54:45.624 line:82%
Tomorrow, we are keeping a small...

1459
01:54:45.687 --> 01:54:47.143 line:82%
veneration for your Bhootnath.

1460
01:54:47.924 --> 01:54:49.922 line:82%
Really? Ls it his birthday?

1461
01:54:52.563 --> 01:54:56.563 line:82%
For his rebirth, for his...
salvation.

1462
01:54:57.503 --> 01:54:59.263 line:82%
Salvation? What's that?

1463
01:55:03.004 --> 01:55:04.043 line:82%
Come here, Banku.

1464
01:55:04.583 --> 01:55:07.903 line:82%
Look, like you have gone
from grade one to grade two...

1465
01:55:08.384 --> 01:55:11.183 line:82%
similarly with this veneration,
your Bhootnath...

1466
01:55:11.864 --> 01:55:14.628 line:82%
will become a star
angel from an ordinary one.

1467
01:55:14.878 --> 01:55:16.997 line:82%
Star angel. I will
just go and inform him.

1468
01:55:17.128 --> 01:55:18.527 line:82%
Hey, Banku... Banku.

1469
01:55:25.444 --> 01:55:27.963 line:82%
Bhootnath, you know I am keeping...

1470
01:55:28.144 --> 01:55:30.663 line:82%
veneration for your salvation.

1471
01:55:35.584 --> 01:55:36.622 line:82%
Salvation?

1472
01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.512 line:82%
Yes. Like I went from grade
one to grade two, similarly...

1473
01:55:41.686 --> 01:55:44.309 line:82%
you will become a star
angel from an ordinary one.

1474
01:55:46.943 --> 01:55:47.983 line:82%
Just like my grandpa.

1475
01:55:53.104 --> 01:55:55.743 line:82%
- Look there.
- Let me look.

1476
01:55:57.743 --> 01:55:58.942 line:82%
Let me look at you
to my heart's content.

1477
01:56:00.823 --> 01:56:03.702 line:82%
I don't know whether I will be
able to meet you again or not.

1478
01:56:04.124 --> 01:56:07.283 line:82%
Why? You will also look at me
like grandpa does, won't you?

1479
01:56:08.324 --> 01:56:11.803 line:82%
I will. I will
only be watching you.

1480
01:56:13.604 --> 01:56:15.283 line:82%
Promise me that you will
also look at me every day.

1481
01:56:16.083 --> 01:56:19.043 line:82%
Promise. But what
if the clouds come?

1482
01:56:21.564 --> 01:56:23.442 line:82%
Not even God can come between us.

1483
01:56:25.404 --> 01:56:27.683 line:82%
Promise me that you will
never trouble your mother.

1484
01:56:28.304 --> 01:56:30.063 line:82%
If she doesn't give me
an ice cream, then I will.

1485
01:56:32.384 --> 01:56:35.983 line:82%
Promise me that you will
never leave your parents.

1486
01:56:36.623 --> 01:56:39.103 line:82%
So many promises?
That, too, at one go?

1487
01:56:39.824 --> 01:56:41.023 line:82%
Bhootnath, you will
just get salvation...

1488
01:56:41.204 --> 01:56:43.883 line:82%
you won't be going anywhere.

1489
01:56:46.624 --> 01:56:49.983 line:82%
Okay, but the last...

1490
01:56:51.843 --> 01:56:53.603 line:82%
Promise me that you will
never fight with anyone...

1491
01:56:53.684 --> 01:56:56.402 line:82%
and you will always forgive everyone.

1492
01:56:57.204 --> 01:57:00.683 line:82%
- I will not forgive anyone.
- No, it's necessary to forgive.

1493
01:57:01.464 --> 01:57:03.303 line:82%
Like dirty clothes
become clean after a wash...

1494
01:57:04.284 --> 01:57:06.707 line:82%
your heart becomes clear
by asking for forgiveness.

1495
01:57:07.124 --> 01:57:09.002 line:82%
Then why didn't you forgive your son?

1496
01:57:11.923 --> 01:57:17.403 line:82%
"Why do you carry the burden..."

1497
01:57:18.544 --> 01:57:28.743 line:82%
"of anger in your heart?"

1498
01:57:30.584 --> 01:57:35.983 line:82%
"The one who forgives his enemy..."

1499
01:57:37.544 --> 01:57:45.543 line:82%
"is the one who attains
knowledge and salvation."

1500
01:57:51.023 --> 01:57:53.703 line:82%
"Time passes by."

1501
01:57:53.783 --> 01:57:58.863 line:82%
"The day sets in and
the night follows."

1502
01:57:59.584 --> 01:58:05.503 line:82%
"When a small lamp
shines in the dark night..."

1503
01:58:06.143 --> 01:58:13.183 line:82%
"though small, the old traveller..."

1504
01:58:13.264 --> 01:58:21.183 line:82%
"uses its light to toddle ahead."

1505
01:58:21.263 --> 01:58:23.780 line:82%
"Time passes by."

1506
01:58:23.864 --> 01:58:29.176 line:82%
"The day sets in and
the night follows."

1507
01:58:29.903 --> 01:58:35.583 line:82%
"When a small lamp
shines in the dark night..."

1508
01:58:36.344 --> 01:58:43.903 line:82%
"though small, the old traveller..."

1509
01:58:43.984 --> 01:58:51.502 line:82%
"uses its light to toddle ahead."

1510
01:58:51.584 --> 01:58:53.983 line:82%
"Time passes by."

1511
01:58:54.064 --> 01:58:59.743 line:82%
"The day sets in and
the night follows."

1512
01:59:34.204 --> 01:59:37.563 line:82%
"While leaving,
I realized who is a near one..."

1513
01:59:37.644 --> 01:59:40.643 line:82%
"and who is a stranger."

1514
01:59:42.724 --> 01:59:45.243 line:82%
"While leaving,
I realized who is a near one..."

1515
01:59:45.324 --> 01:59:48.282 line:82%
"and who is a stranger."

1516
01:59:48.523 --> 01:59:51.563 line:82%
"You are the only one
who is my own."

1517
01:59:51.643 --> 01:59:55.803 line:82%

But... you said that...
we are praying for his birthday.

He went away. He went away.

I am sorry that your
Bhootnath left because of us.

Tell him that this house will stay...

1560
02:05:58.984 --> 02:06:05.223 line:82%
and it's yours from today
and tell him... to forgive me.

What is it that is impossible?"
