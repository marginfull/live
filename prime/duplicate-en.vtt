00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.292 line:82%
O' Lord Shankar! Pashupatinath!

2
00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:55.917 line:82%
You and I, have the same problem.

3
00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:00.708 line:82%
We are both very innocent.
So you are named Bholenath and I'm Bablu.

4
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:07.042 line:82%
Anyways, what can I hide from you.
I've come to you for selfish reasons.

5
00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.583 line:82%
In any case, all who come here,
come for their selfish reasons.

6
00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:12.542 line:82%
But you know that.
You are the Almighty.

7
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.960 line:82%
The thing is,
last time I offered you a coconut,

8
00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.333 line:82%
I got an interview letter.

9
00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.875 line:82%
I've got it here. But this time,
in order to get the job,

10
00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:27.792 line:82%
I've made offerings for you,
using clarified-butter, for that.

11
00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:33.333 line:82%
So, you taste it by yourself,
and then decide whether a cook like me

12
00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:37.042 line:82%
should get the chefs job
in a five star hotel or not.

13
00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:39.792 line:82%
By the way, I've even brought a coconut.

14
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.458 line:82%
I have it with me. Look at this.

15
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.583 line:82%
Praise to the Lord.

16
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.583 line:82%
Praise to Pashupathinath!

17
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.125 line:82%
Hey, Almighty Lord.
Why isn't this coconut breaking?

18
00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.667 line:82%
This never happened before.

19
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.958 line:82%
I hope, nothing untoward is going
to happen today.

20
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.250 line:82%
Run him down!

21
00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:45.833 line:82%
Hey, stop!

22
00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.333 line:82%
Stop!

23
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.917 line:82%
The bastard is dead.

24
00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:15.333 line:82%
Hey, Patel. Call the ambulance.

25
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.958 line:82%
Are you thinking of what I'm thinking?

26
00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:51.625 line:82%
Whether I've fired six shots, or five?

27
00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.750 line:82%
Tell you what? I don't know either.

28
00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:02.875 line:82%
Because if I've fired six bullets,
then it's your good fortune.

29
00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:06.125 line:82%
But if I've fired five shots...

30
00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:12.958 line:82%
...then, it's my fortune.

31
00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:51.958 line:82%
There's no guarantee of what can
happen when in this city.

32
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.542 line:82%
So take this trousers
and run home immediately.

33
00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:57.250 line:82%
I'll pay you next time. Right?

34
00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:02.375 line:82%
It's good that, I lock the door.

35
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.167 line:82%
Otherwise, anyone can open the door...

36
00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:08.583 line:82%
Nobody here.

37
00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.583 line:82%
But, I had switched off the table lamp.

38
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.375 line:82%
Anybody there?

39
00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:38.208 line:82%
Look. Don't come out. I have--
what's this thing in my hand?

40
00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:40.542 line:82%
Something resembling a knife. OK?

41
00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:44.792 line:82%
Mom!

42
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.042 line:82%
When did you come?
How and from where did you come?

43
00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:52.917 line:82%
Hey, I came just now.
In a train. From Jalandhar.

44
00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:56.458 line:82%
-Good you came. I'll touch your feet.
-Live long ,son.

45
00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:58.667 line:82%
I knew already that
you were about to come.

46
00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:02.333 line:82%
That is why my right eye has been
twitching since three days.

47
00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:06.792 line:82%
Want to get a beating?
When a man's right eye twitches,

48
00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:08.625 line:82%
a problem is coming his way.

49
00:07:08.708 --> 00:07:12.250 line:82%
-You called me a problem.
-No, no. I don't mean that, mother.

50
00:07:12.417 --> 00:07:13.958 line:82%
This, give this to me.

51
00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:17.000 line:82%
It's very heavy.

52
00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:23.958 line:82%
Hey, mother. Hug me!

53
00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:30.125 line:82%
-Please.
-Son!

54
00:07:31.792 --> 00:07:33.958 line:82%
Gently, gently.

55
00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:36.958 line:82%
Tell me one thing, mother.

56
00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:40.000 line:82%
-This club that you're carrying--
-You first eat. Eat this!

57
00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:45.542 line:82%
I hope you're not going
to start Dad's arena once again.

58
00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:47.260 line:82%
O God! I wish I could.

59
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.620 line:82%
Everything in this country
is very good, son.

60
00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:54.875 line:82%
But there's only one bad thing here.
Women can't wrestle here. It's for you.

61
00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:58.292 line:82%
-What's wrong, what's wrong?
-Nothing. I'm doing push ups.

62
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.333 line:82%
-That's good. Live long.
-One hundred and one, 102, 103.

63
00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:07.375 line:82%
Listen to this.
Your Dad paid me a visit in a dream.

64
00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:10.667 line:82%
-He came again.
-As well as your grandpa.

65
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.167 line:82%
-And his brother too. There was everyone.
-And his brother too!

66
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.375 line:82%
-They always come.
-What moustaches!

67
00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:20.333 line:82%
Stiff turban and red piped outfit!

68
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.833 line:82%
-I'd die for it.
-I'd die for it.

69
00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:26.583 line:82%
-It was a whole army of wrestlers.
-Army of wrestlers!

70
00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:28.500 line:82%
-Know what he said?
-I don't know.

71
00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:30.500 line:82%
They said to me, "Hey woman...

72
00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:34.542 line:82%
...have some shame.
Go and drown in a pool of buffaloes.

73
00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:37.375 line:82%
Hey, you are the wife
of such a great wrestler.

74
00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:38.917 line:82%
And an even greater wrestler's
daughter-in-law.

75
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000 line:82%
Daughter-in-law!

76
00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:42.000 line:82%
Can't you make your son do four push ups?

77
00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:43.000 line:82%
Oh, I was...

78
00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:46.208 line:82%
He asked me to give this club to you,
and to tell you,

79
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.042 line:82%
"If he doesn't bring pride
to the name of my arena,"

80
00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.000 line:82%
To my arena.

81
00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:51.083 line:82%
-I'll never forgive him."
-I'll never forgive him.

82
00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:54.042 line:82%
This is just what he said.
How do you know?

83
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.792 line:82%
The way I know is that,
you dreamt about this 6500 times.

84
00:08:58.042 --> 00:09:00.958 line:82%
And, you've told me
about it approximately 3500 times.

85
00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:04.500 line:82%
The next time Dad appears in your dream,
clearly tell him.

86
00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:07.167 line:82%
-That I don't want to become a wrestler.
-Then?

87
00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:10.700 line:82%
I'll be the topmost chef in India.
A chef.

88
00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:32.875 line:82%
Hey. Eat yourself and build a body.
Like your Dad had.

89
00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.042 line:82%
-What a diet he had!
-I know. One kilo almonds.

90
00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:37.720 line:82%
A bucket of milk.
Five kilo boiled chick peas,

91
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.900 line:82%
and 20 loaves of corn flour.

92
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.208 line:82%
And one jug of butter.
Didn't even know how to eat.

93
00:09:41.292 --> 00:09:43.583 line:82%
You've told me this so many times,
that I can repeat it blindly.

94
00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.708 line:82%
But, I won't become a wrestler.
I just won't, won't, won't!

95
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:49.167 line:82%
Just think son, someday if god forbid,
you're in a trouble,

96
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.917 line:82%
how will you defend yourself?

97
00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:55.417 line:82%
To defend yourself, you need eight grams
of brain, not one kilo almonds.

98
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.375 line:82%
Which I have.

99
00:09:56.792 --> 00:09:59.125 line:82%
Now, rub this soap on my back
and let me bathe in peace.

100
00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:01.792 line:82%
Go away.
Still a baby. I won't rub it.

101
00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:05.042 line:82%
Mother, I have an interview
in the morning.

102
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.320 line:82%
So, set the alarm for 6 o'clock.

103
00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:11.417 line:82%
I don't need any alarm.
I get up by the crowing of the cock.

104
00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:14.458 line:82%
You should take a bath.
Don't worry. I'll wake you up.

105
00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:19.125 line:82%
One should take a cold water bath!

106
00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.208 line:82%
Let's go.

107
00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.292 line:82%
Aren't you ashamed to break into my house?

108
00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:21.708 line:82%
We are looking for a prisoner
who has escaped from jail.

109
00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:24.667 line:82%
Let’s go.

110
00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:55.833 line:82%
Manu.

111
00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:10.417 line:82%
My body drags you here.
You haven't changed one bit!

112
00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:19.750 line:82%
Manu, you forget that this body
also has a heart.

113
00:12:25.917 --> 00:12:27.625 line:82%
You've started talking a lot.

114
00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:33.958 line:82%
I'm not the same person who will put up
with all your atrocities.

115
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.083 line:82%
What else can you do but tolerate?

116
00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:51.042 line:82%
Tell me what I can do.

117
00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:54.917 line:82%
Shall I tell you?

118
00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:06.875 line:82%
Listen!
The man who were looking for, he--

119
00:13:08.792 --> 00:13:10.333 line:82%
What about him, madam?

120
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:12.917 line:82%
He...

121
00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:16.417 line:82%
Did you find him?

122
00:13:16.875 --> 00:13:20.333 line:82%
Not yet but we'll find him soon.

123
00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:24.375 line:82%
Keep your doors and windows shut, OK?

124
00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:42.375 line:82%
You can never deceive me.

125
00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:46.292 line:82%
Because you...

126
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.125 line:82%
...love me too much.

127
00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:53.917 line:82%
Isn't it? Tell me.

128
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:58.875 line:82%
Say it, Lily.
Say that you love me very much.

129
00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:03.917 line:82%
Say it, Lily.
Why are you silent?

130
00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:05.750 line:82%
Say it.

131
00:14:10.292 --> 00:14:11.667 line:82%
Who is this Manu?

132
00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.500 line:82%
It's vital for us to find out.

133
00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:18.583 line:82%
He's the man who was sentenced
for 10 years.

134
00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:22.042 line:82%
For hold-ups and robberies.
And many other recorded cases.

135
00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:27.417 line:82%
A first class scoundrel who changes
his disguises at the drop of a hat.

136
00:14:28.042 --> 00:14:31.042 line:82%
I want you to recognize him well.

137
00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:34.708 line:82%
These are a few of his disguises.

138
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.917 line:82%
Sometimes he becomes Father D'costa.

139
00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:45.208 line:82%
Sometimes he's hotel manager,
Sharad Mehta.

140
00:14:46.292 --> 00:14:48.500 line:82%
And sometimes businessman Raman.

141
00:14:48.667 --> 00:14:52.125 line:82%
These were some of his disguises,
that are in police records.

142
00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:57.333 line:82%
You will have to be very alert.

143
00:14:57.542 --> 00:15:01.917 line:82%
Because, only Manu knows...

144
00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.708 line:82%
...what his next disguise will be.

145
00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:27.708 line:82%
Who is it?

146
00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:36.958 line:82%
Mother! You've ruined me!
I had to reach at eight for the interview!

147
00:15:37.042 --> 00:15:39.583 line:82%
It's already 7 o'clock.
What will I do? I don't want to play.

148
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:44.125 line:82%
Mother ruined me soon as she came.
She completely ruined me.

149
00:15:44.917 --> 00:15:46.708 line:82%
Oh I found it!

150
00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:49.917 line:82%
Cart, train, no no!
Taxi!

151
00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:54.750 line:82%
Thank God at least got a cab.
It'll save some time.

152
00:15:54.833 --> 00:15:57.375 line:82%
I'll reach the interview in time.

153
00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:04.750 line:82%
-This is my cab.
-This is my cab.

154
00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:10.042 line:82%
Look, I sat in this cab first.
So it is my taxi.

155
00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:12.583 line:82%
I hailed it first so it is mine.

156
00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:16.000 line:82%
-This cab is mine.
-Mine.

157
00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:17.917 line:82%
-It's mine.
-It's mine.

158
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.333 line:82%
-It's mine.
-It's mine.

159
00:16:19.417 --> 00:16:20.375 line:82%
-It's mine.
-It's mine.

160
00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:24.583 line:82%
Quiet!
This cab is neither yours not hers.

161
00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:26.708 line:82%
It belongs to me. Get off!

162
00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:30.250 line:82%
-It's vital that I reach for an interview.
-Listen driver, I am already very late.

163
00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:32.833 line:82%
If I don't reach there by 7:30,
the manager will leave the office.

164
00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:34.340 line:82%
And if he leaves the office,
I'll lose this job.

165
00:16:34.417 --> 00:16:35.792 line:82%
If I lose this job,
my mother would be angry

166
00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:38.667 line:82%
with me and force me to be a wrestler.
Quiet! Quiet!

167
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.042 line:82%
-Quiet!
-Where do you have to go?

168
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.840 line:82%
-Gorai.
-Gorai.

169
00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:53.792 line:82%
Both have to go to the same place.
So, what's the problem?

170
00:16:54.708 --> 00:16:55.958 line:82%
Let's go together.

171
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.667 line:82%
My name is Bablu Chaudhary.

172
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.250 line:82%
Who asked you?

173
00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.583 line:82%
I didn't tell you.
I'm preparing for my interview.

174
00:17:16.667 --> 00:17:20.167 line:82%
-By the way I'm Harpal Singh.
-Who asked you?

175
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.875 line:82%
Look in front and drive.
Don't turn behind.

176
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.042 line:82%
-If you look ahead--
-If you must fight go outside the cab.

177
00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:28.917 line:82%
It's very important for me
to do a rehearsal. Please.

178
00:17:36.042 --> 00:17:40.333 line:82%
My name is Bablu Chaudhary.
I'm from Punjab and I've done BA.

179
00:17:40.417 --> 00:17:42.042 line:82%
And I'm 25 years old.

180
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.333 line:82%
OK. It's 26 years.

181
00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:56.625 line:82%
I've done BA and I have a diploma
from Sarla Cooking Classes.

182
00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:59.417 line:82%
I can cook any kind of meals
and I cook very well.

183
00:18:00.833 --> 00:18:02.667 line:82%
And grilled mashed eggplants
are my specialty.

184
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.958 line:82%
If I get this job, I'll work really hard
and put my heart in it.

185
00:18:06.042 --> 00:18:07.700 line:82%
I won't take any leave,
not even on Sundays.

186
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.140 line:82%
Please give me the job.

187
00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:13.708 line:82%
-I know right.
-By the way, you don't look like a chef.

188
00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:16.125 line:82%
Even my mother says that.

189
00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:19.542 line:82%
According to her,
I should have been a hero or a model.

190
00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:21.917 line:82%
That's not what I meant.

191
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.833 line:82%
I understood what you meant.
Actually you want to make friends.

192
00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:32.625 line:82%
But doesn't matter.
Since we are discussing it, I'll tell you,

193
00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:34.958 line:82%
that I have two dreams.

194
00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:39.292 line:82%
No, make that three.
My first dream is,

195
00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:43.083 line:82%
to be the greatest chef in the world.

196
00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:50.375 line:82%
My second dream is to make my
Bebe
, I mean my mother,

197
00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:54.000 line:82%
I want to make my mother very very happy.

198
00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.042 line:82%
And my third dream is...

199
00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:04.292 line:82%
-...I won't tell.
-Please do.

200
00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:11.583 line:82%
Even I have three dreams.
Should I tell about them?

201
00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:16.125 line:82%
Who asked you? Just drive quietly.
Please look ahead. Don’t turn behind.

202
00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:19.208 line:82%
-Here you are.
-We've reached! We've reached!

203
00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:26.583 line:82%
-How much?
-Its 109.75 rupees.

204
00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:28.583 line:82%
-How much did you say?
-Please don't interrupt us.

205
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.208 line:82%
-Divided by three.
-Its 109.75 rupees.

206
00:19:31.292 --> 00:19:34.167 line:82%
No, it's his car so exclude him.
100 divide by two is 50.

207
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.375 line:82%
-Half of nine is 4.5.
-Take this.

208
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.833 line:82%
Now, the half of 75 paise.

209
00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:41.208 line:82%
She's a girl so, she pays 35 paise
and I'll pay 40.

210
00:19:41.292 --> 00:19:43.792 line:82%
So, the total is 54.40 rupees
and I'll pay the fare.

211
00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:46.458 line:82%
Harpal Singh!

212
00:19:46.792 --> 00:19:48.250 line:82%
Mr. Harpu!

213
00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:53.083 line:82%
Nothing.
I wanted to give money to Harpal Singh...

214
00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:15.667 line:82%
My name is Bablu Chaudhary.

215
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.460 line:82%
I'll take this.

216
00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:24.708 line:82%
Where's the bathroom?

217
00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:01.708 line:82%
Are you Sonia Kapoor?

218
00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:07.917 line:82%
It's you! You are so silly.
First you paid the fare.

219
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.375 line:82%
Then you left.
I went mad trying to locate you.

220
00:22:10.458 --> 00:22:14.542 line:82%
-First take your money. I've kept them.
-It's 54.50 rupees.

221
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:17.042 line:82%
-Hold this please.
-What is this?

222
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.417 line:82%
Bribe.

223
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.167 line:82%
This is not a bribe.
It's her share of the fare.

224
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:26.375 line:82%
My mother says,
men must never take money from girls.

225
00:22:26.792 --> 00:22:28.000 line:82%
Mom?

226
00:22:28.208 --> 00:22:31.750 line:82%
Ravi, one moment.
He's the one I was telling you about.

227
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.167 line:82%
Please go if you've finished.

228
00:22:35.708 --> 00:22:37.167 line:82%
I've having an interview.

229
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.750 line:82%
Mr. Bablu, he's the General Manager,
Mr. Lamba.

230
00:22:41.458 --> 00:22:43.750 line:82%
-And I am--
-I don't want to hear anything.

231
00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:48.583 line:82%
-You may take all the fare from me--
-You are not listening to me, Bablu--

232
00:22:53.417 --> 00:22:54.292 line:82%
Mr. Bablu...

233
00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:59.708 line:82%
She's the Banquet Manager
of this hotel, Sonia Kapoor.

234
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.292 line:82%
I don't need to ask you anything.

235
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.208 line:82%
Because you told me everything
in the taxi-- Bablu?

236
00:23:08.292 --> 00:23:09.125 line:82%
Yes?

237
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.542 line:82%
You've already told me everything.

238
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.700 line:82%
But one thing--

239
00:23:15.667 --> 00:23:19.917 line:82%
-But the question is--
-I'm being interviewed.

240
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.250 line:82%
But a practical test remains.

241
00:23:23.875 --> 00:23:28.042 line:82%
Go into the kitchen
and prepare an Oriental dish.

242
00:23:28.625 --> 00:23:30.792 line:82%
What kind of Oriental dish
would you prefer?

243
00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:43.083 line:82%
Mr. Bablu, this is Sonia's banquet office
not a drama theater.

244
00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:48.167 line:82%
Do you actually know how to cook
or have you just memorized these names?

245
00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:50.125 line:82%
To create an impression.

246
00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:57.542 line:82%
Mr. Lamba, here's the thing,

247
00:23:57.708 --> 00:24:03.000 line:82%
the International Academy of Cuisine
gave me a gold medal for culinary skills.

248
00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:10.375 line:82%
It's as easy as pie for me to do this.

249
00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:15.542 line:82%
Mr. Bablu, a Japanese delegation
is coming here very soon.

250
00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:18.542 line:82%
So, quickly make a Japanese dish.

251
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:25.375 line:82%
Yes. And as per our selection rules,
you have only 20 minutes.

252
00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:26.542 line:82%
20 minutes?

253
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:29.708 line:82%
-Is it too short a time?
-No. It's too much.

254
00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:32.500 line:82%
I can make this dish in 10 minutes.

255
00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:12.500 line:82%
Wow, sir, wow!

256
00:25:13.167 --> 00:25:16.917 line:82%
Wow, sir, wow!

257
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.750 line:82%
Very slowly, the fire of love burned

258
00:25:33.792 --> 00:25:36.875 line:82%
It caused all the love between two hearts
To boil up and overflow

259
00:25:38.083 --> 00:25:41.667 line:82%
I'll just give this pleasure
A little taste

260
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.167 line:82%
Then I'll say that daal
Is ready for serving

261
00:27:00.292 --> 00:27:04.250 line:82%
When you weren't here
Life was just like so

262
00:27:04.417 --> 00:27:07.500 line:82%
Bland, like raw vegetables

263
00:27:08.417 --> 00:27:11.542 line:82%
I couldn't even make pickle brine of love

264
00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:16.125 line:82%
When a beautiful woman
Didn't bring me any sauces

265
00:29:09.833 --> 00:29:12.750 line:82%
Until today, you were alone
Because of this

266
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.167 line:82%
You were sour, you were tough
And you were a bitter gourd

267
00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:21.250 line:82%
Today, you're so virtuous and so kind

268
00:29:22.083 --> 00:29:24.792 line:82%
As if you're a birthday cake

269
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.542 line:82%
You're like a birthday cake

270
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.458 line:82%
I'll just give this pleasure
A little taste

271
00:29:59.167 --> 00:30:02.625 line:82%
Then I'll say that daal
Is ready for serving

272
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.750 line:82%
You're still here?

273
00:30:47.083 --> 00:30:50.708 line:82%
-Yes. I was waiting for you.
-Why?

274
00:30:52.875 --> 00:30:54.417 line:82%
I thought that--

275
00:30:56.208 --> 00:31:00.917 line:82%
I thought, like we gave each other
a lift in the morning...

276
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.583 line:82%
It would be great
if the same thing happened again.

277
00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:10.083 line:82%
-Is that all?
-No.

278
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.833 line:82%
Actually I wanted to say one thing more.

279
00:31:13.917 --> 00:31:18.292 line:82%
I thought if I travel with you
I'll get a chance to thank you.

280
00:31:18.917 --> 00:31:21.333 line:82%
Because I got the job thanks to you.

281
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.333 line:82%
No, you got the job
because of your work.

282
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.750 line:82%
But if you want to thank me,
let's not delay.

283
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.917 line:82%
Who is it?

284
00:31:53.875 --> 00:31:57.083 line:82%
Hey, Gappa, don't you recognize my voice?

285
00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:00.750 line:82%
Kiddo, it's your father.

286
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.333 line:82%
-Does the phone bite?
-You talk. It's Manu.

287
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.917 line:82%
Manu, how are you?
Congratulations.

288
00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:24.458 line:82%
Left prison hours ago
and you didn't come to see us?

289
00:32:25.333 --> 00:32:29.625 line:82%
Shalaku, as if you came
to see me in prison.

290
00:32:30.833 --> 00:32:34.375 line:82%
You've forgotten your old friend.
Didn't you?

291
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.958 line:82%
What are you saying?
Can one forget friends?

292
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:43.208 line:82%
You are right.
In a way, it was better you didn't come.

293
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.042 line:82%
Otherwise the police would have doubts.

294
00:32:48.625 --> 00:32:52.542 line:82%
That you guys were with me
in the bank robbery. Stop the racket!

295
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.292 line:82%
I didn't spill the beans
for the sake of our friendship.

296
00:32:59.917 --> 00:33:03.125 line:82%
Because I am honest even
in this dishonest profession.

297
00:33:04.708 --> 00:33:08.680 line:82%
Heard you guys have started
decent business with the robbed money.

298
00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:14.083 line:82%
You've become very respectable, Shalaku!

299
00:33:14.333 --> 00:33:16.417 line:82%
One has to change with time.

300
00:33:18.708 --> 00:33:20.292 line:82%
When will you come to meet me?

301
00:33:20.917 --> 00:33:23.958 line:82%
I am just coming.
In a little while.

302
00:33:25.042 --> 00:33:26.600 line:82%
Keep my share ready.

303
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.920 line:82%
Oh, shit. Now?

304
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.708 line:82%
I've got an idea. Let's tell the police
and send him to jail.

305
00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:43.250 line:82%
I feel like shooting both of you.

306
00:33:45.375 --> 00:33:49.708 line:82%
Last time, on your suggestion
I only sent Manu to prison.

307
00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:52.160 line:82%
Should have sent him to Hell.

308
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.625 line:82%
Who will pay him? Us?

309
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.500 line:82%
I have known Manu for years.

310
00:33:58.208 --> 00:34:03.420 line:82%
He's such a scoundrel. Nobody knows how,
when and in what disguise he'll come.

311
00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:06.958 line:82%
And his eyes will only be on us.

312
00:34:07.292 --> 00:34:09.875 line:82%
So, Tony will do this job.

313
00:34:10.125 --> 00:34:14.740 line:82%
Call him up and ask him to bring
all his sharp shooters to our club.

314
00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:24.083 line:82%
In this war between me and him,
one of us has to die.

315
00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:31.125 line:82%
I have no line of death in my hand.

316
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.917 line:82%
So, he will come alive.

317
00:34:36.167 --> 00:34:38.180 line:82%
But only his dead body will go back.

318
00:34:39.417 --> 00:34:40.917 line:82%
Gapa speaking.

319
00:34:41.208 --> 00:34:45.300 line:82%
Quickly come to the club.
Have to finish Manu today.

320
00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:49.042 line:82%
He shouldn't escape our clutches.

321
00:34:49.125 --> 00:34:52.458 line:82%
Bring your best men, OK?

322
00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:07.333 line:82%
It's saying something

323
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.750 line:82%
It's saying something

324
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.708 line:82%
It's saying something
This drunken night

325
00:36:23.792 --> 00:36:28.750 line:82%
This colorful and amazing evening

326
00:36:36.167 --> 00:36:40.500 line:82%
It's saying something
This drunkenness

327
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.680 line:82%
This overflowing intoxication

328
00:36:53.292 --> 00:36:57.833 line:82%
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

329
00:37:00.833 --> 00:37:04.750 line:82%
Listen to me my love

330
00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:07.417 line:82%
Please don't leave

331
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:04.167 line:82%
There is only trouble waiting
Outside this door

332
00:38:08.125 --> 00:38:13.583 line:82%
All roads have been blocked
And the destiny is lost

333
00:38:17.417 --> 00:38:22.667 line:82%
Even hope cannot hide
The poisonous daggers

334
00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:32.208 line:82%
The murderers are looking
Everywhere for you

335
00:39:51.667 --> 00:39:57.333 line:82%
I know that the air is poisonous today

336
00:40:00.958 --> 00:40:06.375 line:82%
I know that my enemies are spread
In every direction

337
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.083 line:82%
But whatever happens
I have to fulfill my destiny

338
00:40:19.292 --> 00:40:24.208 line:82%
I'm a traveler and I also have some
Tricks up my sleeve

339
00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:50.167 line:82%
This beautiful night

340
00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:53.875 line:82%
Oh beautiful lady
You're good looking

341
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:59.042 line:82%
You’re breathtaking
My heart is yours!

342
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.042 line:82%
Oh beautiful lady
I'm traveler and I'll come back

343
00:41:05.458 --> 00:41:08.958 line:82%
But right now I've some work to do

344
00:41:12.833 --> 00:41:16.833 line:82%
I have to leave

345
00:41:17.167 --> 00:41:19.042 line:82%
I have to leave

346
00:41:20.167 --> 00:41:22.792 line:82%
Please don't leave

347
00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:26.708 line:82%
Please don't leave

348
00:41:28.042 --> 00:41:31.167 line:82%
Listen to me my love

349
00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:37.625 line:82%
Please don't leave

350
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.080 line:82%
Take it slow,
take it slow.

351
00:41:54.167 --> 00:41:56.792 line:82%
Look, I haven't come here to fight.

352
00:41:57.333 --> 00:42:00.583 line:82%
I've only come for my money.
But it's surprising, I mean,

353
00:42:00.667 --> 00:42:05.020 line:82%
despite my fake beard
but still all you've recognized me.

354
00:42:09.458 --> 00:42:10.875 line:82%
Not right now, Shalaku.

355
00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:10.080 line:82%
Bunty, you go up.

356
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.708 line:82%
Manu, are you all right?

357
00:43:42.958 --> 00:43:45.750 line:82%
Do I look all right?
Go away from here. Leave!

358
00:44:19.958 --> 00:44:21.250 line:82%
No bullets.

359
00:45:11.625 --> 00:45:12.833 line:82%
He's picked it up.

360
00:45:15.792 --> 00:45:19.292 line:82%
Manu... you've spared me.

361
00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:21.958 line:82%
But I won't spare you.

362
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000 line:82%
Lily.

363
00:45:26.625 --> 00:45:29.292 line:82%
Why do you want to see your lover
die in front of you?

364
00:45:30.708 --> 00:45:32.600 line:82%
Go away.
Leave.

365
00:45:33.708 --> 00:45:36.250 line:82%
I had asked you to go away.

366
00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:39.250 line:82%
Why didn't you leave?
Go away now. Just leave!

367
00:46:10.542 --> 00:46:13.542 line:82%
All the arrangements must be in time.
Show me the list.

368
00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:19.792 line:82%
If it's scheduled at 12.30 then lunch--

369
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.280 line:82%
Lunch will be at 1:15--

370
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.250 line:82%
Bablu, I was just thinking of you.

371
00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:38.625 line:82%
The Japanese delegation that was to come
next week is coming tomorrow, Bablu.

372
00:46:38.708 --> 00:46:40.667 line:82%
-Tomorrow is very important for us.
-OK.

373
00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:43.458 line:82%
-There will be 60 people for lunch.
-OK.

374
00:46:43.542 --> 00:46:48.542 line:82%
And if they like the food, we'll
get their business for five years.

375
00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:52.167 line:82%
Don't you worry.
They will like our food.

376
00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:56.750 line:82%
Look, it's a matter of my prestige.

377
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.083 line:82%
Miss Sonia, your prestige is my prestige.

378
00:47:00.167 --> 00:47:02.083 line:82%
Watch me tomorrow
to see what an amazing job I'll do.

379
00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:05.833 line:82%
Select the menu but do show it to me.

380
00:47:07.042 --> 00:47:09.583 line:82%
-Ms. Sonia, one moment please.
-What is it?

381
00:47:11.042 --> 00:47:15.000 line:82%
Ms. Sonia, you haven't eaten
a thing since morning.

382
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:18.292 line:82%
So I've baked you a cake.

383
00:47:21.833 --> 00:47:23.708 line:82%
It is sweet. Have a bite.

384
00:47:26.792 --> 00:47:28.750 line:82%
My hands...

385
00:47:44.167 --> 00:47:45.542 line:82%
You're a good cook.

386
00:47:49.042 --> 00:47:51.583 line:82%
I have some work. See you later.

387
00:47:51.667 --> 00:47:53.750 line:82%
Keep the cake.
We'll eat it together.

388
00:48:04.167 --> 00:48:06.042 line:82%
I'll set him straight.

389
00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.500 line:82%
Watch you instead of the moon...

390
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.220 line:82%
I want to watch you
Instead of the moon--

391
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:20.625 line:82%
What's wrong? Oh God!
Why are you so morose?

392
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:24.708 line:82%
-What's wrong with my baby? What happened?
-I'm very tired, Mom. I'm feeling sleepy.

393
00:48:25.458 --> 00:48:28.208 line:82%
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

394
00:48:28.792 --> 00:48:31.917 line:82%
Neither do you exercise nor eat almonds
or drink milk or butter.

395
00:48:32.167 --> 00:48:34.542 line:82%
-What else will happen.
-That's not true, Mom.

396
00:48:34.917 --> 00:48:38.292 line:82%
I have to cook for 60 Japanese.
I was preparing for that.

397
00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:41.542 line:82%
Don't worry about food at all.

398
00:48:41.667 --> 00:48:44.042 line:82%
I can cook for 600 people in one day.

399
00:48:44.125 --> 00:48:47.292 line:82%
-I'll come with you.
-No, Mom! Not at all.

400
00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:50.833 line:82%
No, you mustn't come.
You can't cook Japanese food.

401
00:48:50.917 --> 00:48:55.708 line:82%
-Why not? Don't they have mothers?
-No, Mom--

402
00:48:55.792 --> 00:48:59.000 line:82%
If they eat food cooked by me,
they will lick their fingers off.

403
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.958 line:82%
-Hug me.
-Oh my son!

404
00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:17.708 line:82%
Patel and Ashok would have
prepared all the spices and everything...

405
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.375 line:82%
Ashok!

406
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:24.292 line:82%
Raju!

407
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.250 line:82%
Patel!

408
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.750 line:82%
Where has everybody gone?

409
00:49:32.833 --> 00:49:34.583 line:82%
I don't understand either.

410
00:49:35.292 --> 00:49:38.917 line:82%
How could all your assistants
go on leave at the same time?

411
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:45.000 line:82%
Bablu, I hope you didn't have
a fight with anyone.

412
00:49:45.375 --> 00:49:48.500 line:82%
No sir, I'm not the kind
who picks up quarrels.

413
00:49:49.625 --> 00:49:52.083 line:82%
But don't you worry sir.

414
00:49:52.167 --> 00:49:57.500 line:82%
The food that will be cooked
in this hotel today will be memorable.

415
00:49:58.625 --> 00:50:03.542 line:82%
Because it's a question of Ms. Sonia's...
prestige.

416
00:50:04.708 --> 00:50:09.542 line:82%
That is fine but you have
very little time in hand, Mr. Bablu.

417
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.292 line:82%
This has to be fried.

418
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:24.250 line:82%
This has to be dry.
And this...

419
00:50:48.792 --> 00:50:49.939 line:82%
-Bablu!
-Mom?

420
00:50:50.042 --> 00:50:54.667 line:82%
My dear son! Oh my God, what a huge place!
Do you work here alone?

421
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.639 line:82%
-From where, when and how did you come?
-First you answer me.

422
00:50:57.708 --> 00:50:59.917 line:82%
Does anybody help you here?

423
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.139 line:82%
-They do but they've gone today.
-Where?

424
00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:03.333 line:82%
On leave. Please leave, Mom.

425
00:51:03.417 --> 00:51:06.125 line:82%
That is why I wondered
why my heart is sinking.

426
00:51:06.208 --> 00:51:09.833 line:82%
No problem.
Now that I'm here. I'll do everything.

427
00:51:09.917 --> 00:51:12.125 line:82%
-Let me do it.
-No, don't touch anything, Mom.

428
00:51:12.208 --> 00:51:14.167 line:82%
I'll handle everything, Mom.
You should go home and rest.

429
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.708 line:82%
-It's a job of a minute for me.
-No! Please.

430
00:51:15.792 --> 00:51:17.667 line:82%
You don't know this, son.
Listen, I'll do it.

431
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.583 line:82%
Come out. Don't waste my time.
I have lots of work...

432
00:51:19.667 --> 00:51:20.759 line:82%
You don't know this, son.
Listen to me. I'll do it.

433
00:51:20.833 --> 00:51:23.099 line:82%
Who let you in? Come outside,

434
00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:25.739 line:82%
-Come outside, don’t waste my time--
-Bablu, you can't do it.

435
00:51:26.167 --> 00:51:28.875 line:82%
Mom, I have so much to do.
I said no once!

436
00:51:28.958 --> 00:51:30.583 line:82%
I'll hug you. Now go home.

437
00:51:30.667 --> 00:51:32.042 line:82%
My spatula. Give it to me.

438
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.000 line:82%
Who let her in?
Go now, leave!

439
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.208 line:82%
Can't be sure about he.
She gets in anywhere.

440
00:51:39.542 --> 00:51:41.625 line:82%
Bablu, is everything ready?

441
00:51:43.417 --> 00:51:44.792 line:82%
Yes.

442
00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:48.458 line:82%
Then come out and see the
arrangements and decorations.

443
00:51:48.708 --> 00:51:50.625 line:82%
-OK.
-Looks good!

444
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.958 line:82%
Ms. Sonia, you're looking gorgeous.

445
00:52:01.583 --> 00:52:05.792 line:82%
Bablu, son!
Where has he gone?

446
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:10.208 line:82%
The food is ready.

447
00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:15.083 line:82%
Let me check.
He doesn't know a thing

448
00:52:17.625 --> 00:52:20.000 line:82%
Absolutely bland.
He forgot to add salt.

449
00:52:20.083 --> 00:52:21.708 line:82%
Doesn't listen to me.

450
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.833 line:82%
This should have been tempered.
Who can make him understand?

451
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.500 line:82%
No salt or chili or spices.
Who will eat such bland food?

452
00:52:37.083 --> 00:52:38.542 line:82%
Nobody will eat this.

453
00:52:40.417 --> 00:52:42.167 line:82%
Now I will have to do something!

454
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:45.000 line:82%
Is everything all right? Do you think
the arrangements are fine?

455
00:52:45.458 --> 00:52:48.042 line:82%
Very good, Ms. Sonia.
These arrangements are fantastic.

456
00:52:48.583 --> 00:52:50.000 line:82%
Just like you.

457
00:52:50.458 --> 00:52:54.250 line:82%
Really? Should I tell Lamba to bring
the delegation down for lunch?

458
00:52:54.417 --> 00:52:57.000 line:82%
Don't worry. The food is ready.

459
00:53:03.708 --> 00:53:05.333 line:82%
You made all the food yourself?

460
00:53:08.542 --> 00:53:09.583 line:82%
What was that?

461
00:53:16.292 --> 00:53:20.083 line:82%
Mom, I had left you out.
What're you doing here?

462
00:53:21.167 --> 00:53:26.042 line:82%
-And what are you doing?
-Set right your mistake.

463
00:53:26.125 --> 00:53:28.333 line:82%
-What?
-I fixed it and tempered this.

464
00:53:28.417 --> 00:53:30.625 line:82%
-Added garlic to that. Crushed one.
-You tempered it, Mom.

465
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:32.999 line:82%
Mom, this things are not tempered.
It's Japanese food.

466
00:53:33.099 --> 00:53:35.159 line:82%
This is not Punjabi food.

467
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:39.625 line:82%
Whether food is Punjabi or Japanese,
it should taste good.

468
00:53:39.708 --> 00:53:41.167 line:82%
Taste it and see.

469
00:53:42.125 --> 00:53:46.333 line:82%
Forget it! I have lost my job!
I have lost my job!

470
00:53:46.542 --> 00:53:50.000 line:82%
-No, you won't lose it.
-Go out, Mom. Leave!

471
00:53:50.083 --> 00:53:52.250 line:82%
-Get out, Mom!
-Listen to me...

472
00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:56.125 line:82%
-Please leave me alone. Step outside.
-Put this in, put I.

473
00:53:56.333 --> 00:54:00.625 line:82%
Bablu, what are you doing?
I'll fall in the water!

474
00:54:29.875 --> 00:54:31.875 line:82%
Hurry up.
Hurry up. Over there.

475
00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:40.917 line:82%
Bablu? What is it?

476
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.792 line:82%
Ms. Sonia, I have to say something
very important to you.

477
00:54:44.042 --> 00:54:48.625 line:82%
-Not now. The Japanese are on--
-It's about them.

478
00:54:49.167 --> 00:54:52.292 line:82%
-What is it, Bablu?
-Ms. Sonia, this food that I've sent...

479
00:54:52.375 --> 00:54:55.875 line:82%
-It's not Japanese.
-But you made Japanese food.

480
00:54:55.958 --> 00:54:59.500 line:82%
-It has become Punjabi.
-How can Japanese be Punjabi?

481
00:54:59.583 --> 00:55:03.042 line:82%
-But my mother is Punjabi.
-How is she related to Japanese food?

482
00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:05.083 line:82%
She is not related to Japan but Punjab.

483
00:55:05.167 --> 00:55:07.333 line:82%
-Is she a Japanese?
-She hails from Punjab.

484
00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:09.375 line:82%
Japanese mother.
Punjabi food.

485
00:55:09.458 --> 00:55:12.583 line:82%
No. I'll explain to you.
Punjabi mother and Japanese food.

486
00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:15.083 line:82%
The Japanese food I sent...

487
00:55:15.583 --> 00:55:20.083 line:82%
-... is full of Punjabi spices.
-What?

488
00:55:29.167 --> 00:55:31.125 line:82%
Welcome.

489
00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:39.958 line:82%
You ruined me. Destroyed me.
Now, I'll lose my job.

490
00:55:40.083 --> 00:55:43.417 line:82%
-But what have I done?
-Keep quiet! Let me talk!

491
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.708 line:82%
Whenever you come from the village,
you create some problem for me.

492
00:55:48.708 --> 00:55:50.500 line:82%
-Who? Me?
-Then, who else?

493
00:55:58.208 --> 00:56:01.792 line:82%
Oh Mom, why don't you understand?
I'm not a kid anymore!

494
00:56:03.208 --> 00:56:08.833 line:82%
Stupid, you matter how much a child grows,
he remains a kid for his mother!

495
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.250 line:82%
All right if you don't need me,
I am going home.

496
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:17.042 line:82%
Don't ever ask me to hug you again.

497
00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:19.458 line:82%
Don't say that. Never say that.
I don’t want to hear it.

498
00:56:21.333 --> 00:56:22.583 line:82%
Mom...

499
00:56:28.875 --> 00:56:33.375 line:82%
Didn't you hear?
They are asking for your chef.

500
00:56:34.375 --> 00:56:35.792 line:82%
Go and call him.

501
00:56:46.625 --> 00:56:49.708 line:82%
-Bablu, what are you doing?
-Ms. Sonia, I'm taking my life.

502
00:56:50.667 --> 00:56:52.958 line:82%
Do that later.
First come in and tell everyone

503
00:56:53.059 --> 00:56:54.699 line:82%
it's your mistake not mine.

504
00:56:54.792 --> 00:56:55.919 line:82%
No Ms. Sonia, I won’t do that.

505
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.375 line:82%
The Japanese will thrash me
if I go inside.

506
00:56:57.458 --> 00:57:00.750 line:82%
-And you should be.
-Ms. Sonia, forgive me please.

507
00:57:00.833 --> 00:57:03.500 line:82%
-Don't take me in.
-You have to be punished.

508
00:57:03.583 --> 00:57:06.125 line:82%
-They'll beat me.
-Keep moving, Bablu!

509
00:57:06.208 --> 00:57:09.000 line:82%
Ms. Sonia,
Ms. Sonia... Ms. Sonia,

510
00:57:09.083 --> 00:57:13.208 line:82%
-Ms. Sonia, listen to me.
-Walk straight.

511
00:57:13.292 --> 00:57:17.292 line:82%
I'll work as your cook all my life,
cook for you and take no leave for Sunday.

512
00:57:30.042 --> 00:57:34.792 line:82%
Bablu, he is saying that they all
liked your food very much.

513
00:57:55.333 --> 00:57:57.833 line:82%
-What are you doing up there? Come down.
-I don't know.

514
00:57:57.917 --> 00:57:59.375 line:82%
Coming in a minute.

515
00:58:11.125 --> 00:58:12.500 line:82%
Standing in the middle.

516
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:14.179 line:82%
REWARD RS. 1,00,000
MANU

517
00:58:18.292 --> 00:58:20.419 line:82%
Who is it? Maruti?
Yes, speak up.

518
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:24.667 line:82%
Sir, I've seen Manu going with a girl
to Seaside Restaurant.

519
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:27.625 line:82%
-Are you sure?
-
Absolutely, sir!

520
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:34.833 line:82%
-Ms. Sonia, I want to...
-I know you want to tell me something

521
00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:39.625 line:82%
Should I tell you?

522
00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:48.000 line:82%
-Ms. Sonia, I saw a dream.
-Is that so?

523
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:54.458 line:82%
I have married a beautiful girl.

524
00:58:58.625 --> 00:58:59.875 line:82%
Just like you.

525
00:59:02.542 --> 00:59:03.625 line:82%
Who is it?

526
00:59:06.125 --> 00:59:11.375 line:82%
And the day we get married,
she is dressed in bridal finery,

527
00:59:11.667 --> 00:59:12.819 line:82%
and is sitting on my bed.

528
00:59:15.333 --> 00:59:19.458 line:82%
And softly I walk towards her.

529
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:21.833 line:82%
Then?

530
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:26.833 line:82%
Then I lift her veil.

531
00:59:30.583 --> 00:59:33.208 line:82%
-Next?
-Then I...

532
00:59:38.125 --> 00:59:39.792 line:82%
With my hands...

533
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.167 line:82%
Who?

534
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:45.167 line:82%
-I...
-Yes?

535
00:59:51.708 --> 00:59:53.333 line:82%
I feed her a potato dumpling in a bun,

536
00:59:57.042 --> 00:59:58.125 line:82%
A potato dumpling in a bun.

537
01:00:01.375 --> 01:00:04.458 line:82%
A potato dumpling in a bun.
Come here.

538
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.042 line:82%
Bablu.
Why didn't you meet me earlier?

539
01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:22.750 line:82%
-Stupid!
-Feeling shy.

540
01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:26.875 line:82%
There's a girl with eyes like daggers

541
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:34.167 line:82%
She argues constantly about one thing

542
01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:51.583 line:82%
"Why didn't you meet me earlier?"

543
01:00:54.292 --> 01:00:58.792 line:82%
Every day she says this
And fights with me

544
01:01:00.042 --> 01:01:03.500 line:82%
There's a girl with eyes like daggers

545
01:01:06.125 --> 01:01:09.750 line:82%
Constantly argues about one thing

546
01:02:13.042 --> 01:02:18.375 line:82%
Sulking, she tells me
"I don't love you"

547
01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:27.875 line:82%
She keeps writing my name
On every piece of paper

548
01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:37.375 line:82%
I'm also crazy for her

549
01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:42.500 line:82%
How do I make her understand?

550
01:02:55.875 --> 01:03:01.708 line:82%
If she ever decides to leave me

551
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:06.458 line:82%
I'll die in one day

552
01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:25.419 line:82%
You told me about the dream

553
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.708 line:82%
And the girl in the dream.

554
01:04:27.792 --> 01:04:29.542 line:82%
Why didn't you tell me her name?

555
01:04:29.792 --> 01:04:33.542 line:82%
-I'll tell you some other time.
-Why not now?

556
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.083 line:82%
-The girl's name is...
-Manu.

557
01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:53.708 line:82%
That's a boy's name. We are...

558
01:04:53.792 --> 01:04:57.417 line:82%
Who are they? I'll check.

559
01:05:00.579 --> 01:05:03.359 line:82%
What are you guys doing here?
Has a minister arrived here?

560
01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:05.667 line:82%
No, a gangster has come.

561
01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:09.250 line:82%
-Which gangster?
-Manu.

562
01:05:09.417 --> 01:05:10.417 line:82%
Who's Manu?

563
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.375 line:82%
-You.
-Me?

564
01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:16.292 line:82%
What are you doing?
Why are you pushing me down?

565
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.583 line:82%
What're you doing?
Wait! Stop.

566
01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:23.833 line:82%
-Stop, stop!
-Bablu!

567
01:05:23.917 --> 01:05:27.167 line:82%
Manu! I'm asking you for the last time.

568
01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:30.833 line:82%
Who helped you escape from prison?
Now, tell me!

569
01:05:31.208 --> 01:05:34.419 line:82%
I've never been to jail.
So how can I escape from there?

570
01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:36.779 line:82%
And I'm not Manu!

571
01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:42.542 line:82%
Are you trying to fool me?
Think you're extra smart?

572
01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:47.708 line:82%
Now, tell me, since when is this girl,
Lily in your gang?

573
01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:50.999 line:82%
You're Lily?

574
01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:56.875 line:82%
I'm no Lily! I'm Sonia.
Sonia Kapoor.

575
01:05:56.958 --> 01:06:00.839 line:82%
-And I'm not Manu.
-So, she's not Lily

576
01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:06.208 line:82%
You're not Manu,
then maybe I'm not Inspector R.K. Thakur.

577
01:06:21.917 --> 01:06:24.208 line:82%
What are you staring at?
Dial this number.

578
01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:29.958 line:82%
Ask for our hotel manager, Mr. Lamba.

579
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.083 line:82%
I'm the Banquet Manager
and he is my chef.

580
01:06:34.125 --> 01:06:37.042 line:82%
-He's my chef.
-Come here.

581
01:06:40.917 --> 01:06:43.667 line:82%
Whose idea was it to work in a hotel,
Manu?

582
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.708 line:82%
Sir, I'm not Manu gangster.

583
01:06:48.542 --> 01:06:50.833 line:82%
-You're not Manu, right? You are Bablu.
-Yes.

584
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.417 line:82%
Do you have any proof of that?

585
01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:56.958 line:82%
-Bebe!
-Bebe?

586
01:06:57.292 --> 01:07:00.708 line:82%
-My mother.
-Call his mother!

587
01:07:01.208 --> 01:07:03.458 line:82%
Yes, sir I'll call up my mother.

588
01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:10.125 line:82%
Now, you'll see when my mother
will come here and see me with Ms. Sonia--

589
01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:15.375 line:82%
No sir, I can't call my mother here.

590
01:07:15.917 --> 01:07:19.083 line:82%
-Why, Bablu?
-No, Sonia. I can't call my mother here.

591
01:07:19.167 --> 01:07:21.833 line:82%
Sir, if she sees me here
she will murder me.

592
01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:24.625 line:82%
I mean you may murder me
but I won't call her here!

593
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:28.250 line:82%
Sir, please try to understand.
If she comes here...

594
01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:30.375 line:82%
Hang me but I won't call her here.

595
01:07:33.292 --> 01:07:36.167 line:82%
Manu, you are trapped.

596
01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:39.292 line:82%
If he has a mother, she will come.
But there is no mother.

597
01:07:50.417 --> 01:07:55.458 line:82%
If I knew the truth about you'
I would have handed you to the police!

598
01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:03.750 line:82%
I told you earlier
but you are so innocent that...

599
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.292 line:82%
...you trust everyone so easily.

600
01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:09.917 line:82%
Mr. Lamba, I know you.

601
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000 line:82%
Inspector, this is Sonia Kapoor,
our banquet manager.

602
01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:16.625 line:82%
She's been in our hotel for years.

603
01:08:17.958 --> 01:08:23.917 line:82%
And whether this is Bablu or Manu...

604
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.458 line:82%
I can't give his guarantee.

605
01:08:31.583 --> 01:08:36.000 line:82%
-I can vouch for her though.
-Fine you may take her.

606
01:08:42.458 --> 01:08:44.099 line:82%
-Bablu! I'm a chef.
-He'll run off.

607
01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:46.750 line:82%
Ms. Sonia?
The cake I...

608
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.859 line:82%
-Will you beat me?
-Not at all.

609
01:08:49.958 --> 01:08:52.379 line:82%
-You won't beat me?
-No.

610
01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:53.917 line:82%
Mom!

611
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.059 line:82%
What? My son in jail!

612
01:08:56.292 --> 01:08:59.000 line:82%
Are these policemen crazy?
What?

613
01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:02.750 line:82%
They want proof?
I'll just bring it over!

614
01:09:02.958 --> 01:09:05.875 line:82%
I'll ruin them all.

615
01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:12.750 line:82%
-Who are you?
-Who am I?

616
01:09:12.833 --> 01:09:16.539 line:82%
-I'm Bablu's mother.
-What proof do you have?

617
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.359 line:82%
Rascal! What proof do you have
that you are your mother's son?

618
01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:25.500 line:82%
-Mom!
-Bablu!

619
01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:28.333 line:82%
You can't go there!
He's a criminal! He's dangerous.

620
01:09:29.625 --> 01:09:32.375 line:82%
Mom, they think I'm somebody else
not Bablu.

621
01:09:32.458 --> 01:09:35.708 line:82%
-Please tell them.
-He is Bablu. I swear by God. He's Bablu.

622
01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:39.208 line:82%
He's my child. Bablu.
Look at his childhood photographs.

623
01:09:39.333 --> 01:09:41.958 line:82%
-Show it to me, Mom.
-When we had gone to the fair.

624
01:09:42.125 --> 01:09:43.750 line:82%
You haven't seen this.

625
01:09:43.833 --> 01:09:46.625 line:82%
This is last year's picture when
we went to Vaishnodevi's temple.

626
01:09:46.833 --> 01:09:49.417 line:82%
-It was taken there.
-Mom, you looked beautiful then.

627
01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:53.125 line:82%
See, I brought all the proof.

628
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.292 line:82%
Give vent to your anger later.
First, release my son.

629
01:10:01.042 --> 01:10:03.875 line:82%
Live long.
May God make you a commissioner.

630
01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:06.833 line:82%
Hug me, mother.

631
01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:10.833 line:82%
Let's go home...

632
01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.375 line:82%
Eenie, meenie, minnie, moe

633
01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:20.542 line:82%
Eighty, ninety and total hundred.

634
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:24.667 line:82%
The point lands on hundred,

635
01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:32.292 line:82%
and the thief didn't manage to escape.

636
01:10:46.667 --> 01:10:47.583 line:82%
Who is it?

637
01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:50.458 line:82%
-Come in.
-
Called somebody else?

638
01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:54.667 line:82%
No, not at all.
Whom would I call except you?

639
01:10:54.875 --> 01:10:57.250 line:82%
-Don't whistle!
-
Who is it?

640
01:10:57.333 --> 01:11:00.667 line:82%
Television mechanic.
Come to fix the set.

641
01:11:01.292 --> 01:11:05.458 line:82%
Darling, there's nobody in my life
but you.

642
01:11:05.542 --> 01:11:06.375 line:82%
Liar!

643
01:11:06.542 --> 01:11:09.292 line:82%
But you've become very smart.

644
01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:10.708 line:82%
Don't waste time talking.

645
01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:12.917 line:82%
-Come soon, my darling.
-
I'll be there.

646
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.625 line:82%
I'm dying to see you.

647
01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:18.839 line:82%
Hey, you,

648
01:11:19.333 --> 01:11:21.375 line:82%
are you paid for nothing?

649
01:11:21.917 --> 01:11:25.792 line:82%
Does your father lose something
if you fix these things earlier?

650
01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:29.417 line:82%
You depraved people
have only one problem!

651
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:34.958 line:82%
Rascals are accustomed
to eating for nothing!

652
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:40.292 line:82%
-Everybody does that, sir.
-What did you say?

653
01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:43.250 line:82%
You argue with me!
Do your job and get lost!

654
01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:46.125 line:82%
Why, sir?
Is some broad coming over?

655
01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:51.875 line:82%
Asking me? How dare you ask me!

656
01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:55.333 line:82%
Rascal! You scum!

657
01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:03.458 line:82%
Manu?

658
01:12:05.292 --> 01:12:08.750 line:82%
Recognized me? Your old partner Manu.

659
01:12:09.667 --> 01:12:13.167 line:82%
Now tell me who eats off other's living?

660
01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:15.542 line:82%
You or me?

661
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.239 line:82%
Gappa, you sent me to prison

662
01:12:22.042 --> 01:12:26.917 line:82%
and now you're watching television
in comfort at my expense.

663
01:12:30.625 --> 01:12:32.250 line:82%
This is nice.

664
01:12:37.167 --> 01:12:39.208 line:82%
You love to watch television, right?

665
01:12:39.417 --> 01:12:42.917 line:82%
-No!
-Yes you love it.

666
01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:46.917 line:82%
Come here.
I'll show you some television.

667
01:12:48.792 --> 01:12:50.679 line:82%
But you can't see it from far.

668
01:12:51.292 --> 01:12:53.250 line:82%
Your eye sight is weak.

669
01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:56.083 line:82%
That's why you couldn't recognize me.
Come.

670
01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:59.792 line:82%
-Come a little closer. I'll show you TV.
-No.

671
01:13:01.292 --> 01:13:04.708 line:82%
-Come a little closer. I'll show you TV.
-No.

672
01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:16.500 line:82%
Ingratiate!
Eats chicken with my money.

673
01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:21.083 line:82%
Come closer, I'll show you the television.
Come on! Come on!

674
01:13:22.458 --> 01:13:25.000 line:82%
-Now can you see?
-No.

675
01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:29.000 line:82%
Go close and see.
Can you see it?

676
01:13:29.083 --> 01:13:30.333 line:82%
-Forgive me.
-What?

677
01:13:30.542 --> 01:13:33.042 line:82%
-Forgive me.
-OK.

678
01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:36.167 line:82%
I'll forgive him.

679
01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:38.458 line:82%
I'll forgive him.

680
01:14:00.208 --> 01:14:04.042 line:82%
Our friend and partner, Gappa
got killed because,

681
01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:07.958 line:82%
your police department
let loose a nabbed criminal.

682
01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:11.083 line:82%
Why? Was he related to you?

683
01:14:11.292 --> 01:14:13.792 line:82%
We set him free after inquiries.

684
01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:19.917 line:82%
On seeing his pictures with his mom
we realized he was Bablu not Manu.

685
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.208 line:82%
He is not Bablu,
he is Manu!

686
01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.917 line:82%
He was disguised as Bablu
and fooled this chap.

687
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:29.000 line:82%
He doesn't know that
Manu is a man of many faces.

688
01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:30.375 line:82%
He can dress up like anybody.

689
01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:33.375 line:82%
Sir, what about his mother.
What about the photographs?

690
01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:39.417 line:82%
Listen Mister, you get mothers
on hire for 100 rupees. Pictures for 50.

691
01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:43.167 line:82%
Then whether you call him Manu
or Bablu, it's the same man.

692
01:14:44.042 --> 01:14:46.750 line:82%
How much did Manu pay you?

693
01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.667 line:82%
That's an allegation.

694
01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:52.292 line:82%
I'm an honest police officer.
And the commissioner's brother-in-law.

695
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:55.417 line:82%
Why don't you say something,
brother-in-law?

696
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.019 line:82%
This is my office, Inspector Thakur.
Behave yourself.

697
01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:03.292 line:82%
Mr. Shalaku and Mr. Dhingra, Manu...

698
01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:07.750 line:82%
...was your old partner.
Isn’t that true?

699
01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:10.625 line:82%
-Yeah, that...
-Please take a seat.

700
01:15:12.667 --> 01:15:15.359 line:82%
Commissioner Sir,
please check your record.

701
01:15:15.619 --> 01:15:17.239 line:82%
We got him imprisoned.

702
01:15:17.458 --> 01:15:20.083 line:82%
Really, is that why he is after you?

703
01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:24.583 line:82%
Their protection
is also our responsibility.

704
01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:29.667 line:82%
We must apprehend Manu
before he attacks either of them.

705
01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:30.899 line:82%
Got it, Inspector Thakur?

706
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.167 line:82%
Go if you want to.

707
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.125 line:82%
But you will see I won't eat.

708
01:15:36.583 --> 01:15:41.917 line:82%
I won't do exercise.
I'll find some dirty girl and get married.

709
01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:44.250 line:82%
-Sister.
-What is it?

710
01:15:44.792 --> 01:15:46.139 line:82%
Will you marry me?

711
01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:53.792 line:82%
-You'll see--
-What are you murmuring son?

712
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.458 line:82%
-Don't go!
-Son, there's an evil eye on you.

713
01:15:58.667 --> 01:16:02.917 line:82%
Your stars are bad. When I complete
this pilgrimage, all will be fine.

714
01:16:03.208 --> 01:16:06.917 line:82%
Mom, if you go, I'll be left alone.

715
01:16:07.292 --> 01:16:11.125 line:82%
But son, I'm going for you!
Why don't you understand?

716
01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:13.500 line:82%
I too don't like going
far away from my only son.

717
01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:17.708 line:82%
-Then why are you going?
-Some rascal has cast a spell on you.

718
01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:21.542 line:82%
I'll go there, pray for you.
The Lord will set matters right.

719
01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:24.833 line:82%
I'll come back soon.
Don't cry my son.

720
01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:30.042 line:82%
Bablu!
Bablu?

721
01:16:30.625 --> 01:16:33.125 line:82%
-What is it?
-Hug me.

722
01:16:36.542 --> 01:16:39.583 line:82%
My precious son!

723
01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:41.875 line:82%
-Bablu?
-
The phone is out of order.

724
01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:43.750 line:82%
-Bablu?
-
I said the phone is not working.

725
01:16:44.083 --> 01:16:45.583 line:82%
This is Sonia.

726
01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:53.042 line:82%
-Oh Bablu, you're still angry with me.
-No, why should I be?

727
01:16:53.167 --> 01:16:56.859 line:82%
In any case I'm not Bablu.
I'm that guy... Manu.

728
01:16:59.079 --> 01:17:01.208 line:82%
Don't be mad now.
OK, fine.

729
01:17:03.042 --> 01:17:07.375 line:82%
-Now when do we meet?
-I don't want to meet you.

730
01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:11.167 line:82%
You will have to meet me.
I'm not used to being turned down.

731
01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:14.500 line:82%
Today, Hilltop Restaurant at 4 o'clock.
OK, Bablu?

732
01:17:16.667 --> 01:17:20.708 line:82%
-You will be there.
-I will not. I will not come!

733
01:17:23.167 --> 01:17:25.250 line:82%
I know you will come.

734
01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:47.292 line:82%
There's going to be a little naughtiness

735
01:17:47.833 --> 01:17:50.708 line:82%
There's going to be a bit of disaster

736
01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:53.708 line:82%
We're about to lose our senses

737
01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:57.583 line:82%
We're going to fall in love

738
01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:14.875 line:82%
We are walking and singing

739
01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:18.583 line:82%
Not thinking about anything
We still keep going

740
01:19:18.667 --> 01:19:21.958 line:82%
Not thinking about where we would go

741
01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:31.042 line:82%
In our eyes, dreams are melting
And softly spilling over

742
01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:35.958 line:82%
These are all signs of love

743
01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:44.208 line:82%
Whether you believe it now or not
Darling

744
01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:02.125 line:82%
There's going to be a little naughtiness

745
01:20:02.542 --> 01:20:05.250 line:82%
There's going to be a bit of disaster

746
01:20:05.833 --> 01:20:08.792 line:82%
We're about to lose our senses

747
01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:12.125 line:82%
We're about to fall in love

748
01:20:54.167 --> 01:20:57.375 line:82%
You're so innocent

749
01:20:57.458 --> 01:21:00.583 line:82%
What you've said up till now

750
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:04.000 line:82%
Don’t continue that story

751
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:13.208 line:82%
In this world, how there are people
This way and that way

752
01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:18.333 line:82%
Everyone here is an enemy of the heart

753
01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:26.167 line:82%
Whether you know it or not
Darling

754
01:22:38.042 --> 01:22:40.917 line:82%
Look, you're making a huge mistake,
this is police brutality.

755
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.750 line:82%
I'll report this to press,
Hindustan Times, Times of India,

756
01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:45.833 line:82%
Indian Express, Asian Age,
Lok Satha, Jan Satha,

757
01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:48.667 line:82%
your photo will be printed
on the first page of all newspapers.

758
01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:50.500 line:82%
DANGEROUS CRIMINAL MANU ARRESTED.

759
01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:01.958 line:82%
Did you see this?

760
01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:10.708 line:82%
From where has he come?

761
01:23:11.083 --> 01:23:14.667 line:82%
My duplicate? Carbon copy?

762
01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:21.667 line:82%
I must take advantage of this.

763
01:23:23.083 --> 01:23:28.000 line:82%
Because my life is in his death.

764
01:23:31.458 --> 01:23:33.208 line:82%
Where are you going?

765
01:23:34.958 --> 01:23:39.292 line:82%
You wait here. I'll check it out.

766
01:23:56.042 --> 01:23:57.583 line:82%
Mr. Dhingra?

767
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:08.083 line:82%
What a bomb.
The boss's night is made.

768
01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:29.292 line:82%
Oh Manu!

769
01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:34.583 line:82%
My friend!
I know you are pulling my leg.

770
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:46.750 line:82%
What a funny thing you did.
You had me scared.

771
01:27:00.083 --> 01:27:04.583 line:82%
No, brother-in-law, this can't be Manu.
I locked him up in prison myself.

772
01:27:04.792 --> 01:27:07.619 line:82%
This is Manu's doing, Inspector.
It's his doing.

773
01:27:08.042 --> 01:27:12.333 line:82%
Commissioner, that scoundrel Manu
has killed Dhingra.

774
01:27:12.417 --> 01:27:16.042 line:82%
If Manu killed Dhingra then
who is the one in prison?

775
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:28.458 line:82%
This is not one man,
but two men who look alike.

776
01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:33.000 line:82%
Wow! What a photocopy machine
the Lord has.

777
01:27:33.599 --> 01:27:35.083 line:82%
They both look alike.

778
01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:38.958 line:82%
It's difficult to differentiate
between the original and the duplicate.

779
01:27:39.542 --> 01:27:41.625 line:82%
Our problems have doubled.

780
01:27:42.208 --> 01:27:44.066 line:82%
What do we do about Bablu,
brother-in-law?

781
01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:46.979 line:82%
This is my office, Inspector Thakur!

782
01:27:52.083 --> 01:27:54.833 line:82%
-Make an ID card and give it to Bablu.
-OK.

783
01:27:55.125 --> 01:27:59.167 line:82%
So if we make another mistake,
we can know from the ID card,

784
01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:01.958 line:82%
who is the original
and who is the duplicate.

785
01:28:06.333 --> 01:28:09.792 line:82%
Son, this is your ID card, OK?

786
01:28:10.208 --> 01:28:11.999 line:82%
Keep it safe.

787
01:28:12.958 --> 01:28:17.167 line:82%
The difference between you
and Manu is this ID card.

788
01:28:17.917 --> 01:28:21.667 line:82%
If a policeman catches you,
show it to him.

789
01:28:21.958 --> 01:28:23.917 line:82%
And be free in a jiffy.

790
01:28:25.125 --> 01:28:26.042 line:82%
Understood?

791
01:28:32.667 --> 01:28:36.458 line:82%
I got it!
I got an ID card!

792
01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:38.917 line:82%
I got an ID card!

793
01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:41.083 line:82%
Listen to me!

794
01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:55.000 line:82%
Mom has come.
Hide and seek.

795
01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:02.708 line:82%
Hide and seek
You're hiding

796
01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:08.208 line:82%
He's running here and there
this little mouse

797
01:29:09.042 --> 01:29:11.667 line:82%
You should run, little mouse
the cat has come to catch you

798
01:29:12.125 --> 01:29:15.583 line:82%
The cat meowed

799
01:29:15.792 --> 01:29:18.667 line:82%
there is no need to worry

800
01:29:19.542 --> 01:29:23.208 line:82%
Mom has returned from Kashi

801
01:29:23.583 --> 01:29:26.500 line:82%
just hug her

802
01:29:28.667 --> 01:29:32.292 line:82%
Mom come and hug me!

803
01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:42.542 line:82%
Are you smoking, Mom?

804
01:29:52.583 --> 01:29:53.708 line:82%
Who am I?

805
01:29:59.625 --> 01:30:03.458 line:82%
No Bablu, you are not dreaming.

806
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.250 line:82%
I am Manu and you are Bablu.

807
01:30:08.917 --> 01:30:11.750 line:82%
You are my duplicate.

808
01:30:16.667 --> 01:30:19.375 line:82%
So you are Manu gangster!

809
01:30:20.667 --> 01:30:23.042 line:82%
Do you know how much
I suffered because of you?

810
01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:26.875 line:82%
The police locked me up twice,
thinking that I am Manu gangster.

811
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:32.042 line:82%
And Sonia...
She is my girlfriend.

812
01:30:32.625 --> 01:30:34.208 line:82%
She too is angry with me.

813
01:30:35.458 --> 01:30:39.583 line:82%
But thanks to this,
one moment, identity card.

814
01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:42.875 line:82%
Which the police gave me so
this mistake is not repeated.

815
01:30:46.833 --> 01:30:49.750 line:82%
Why are you putting out
your tongue repeatedly?

816
01:30:50.083 --> 01:30:51.167 line:82%
Are you teasing me?

817
01:30:52.375 --> 01:30:56.042 line:82%
Look, I know you are uninvited guests
in this house.

818
01:30:56.833 --> 01:31:02.375 line:82%
But the thing is that if somebody sees me
with you, I will be in great difficulty.

819
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:09.167 line:82%
So, just take your pals and leave.
Leave.

820
01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:15.750 line:82%
Manu comes of his own will
and leaves when he desires.

821
01:31:17.792 --> 01:31:21.583 line:82%
Sholay? No, no...
It's from Seeta Aur Geeta.

822
01:31:21.667 --> 01:31:24.458 line:82%
-No...
-Quiet! Come on.

823
01:31:24.542 --> 01:31:25.917 line:82%
Give me the ID card.

824
01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:30.375 line:82%
-No, I can't give it to you.
-Quietly hand it over.

825
01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:31.899 line:82%
No, I can't give it to you.

826
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:38.625 line:82%
Look, Mom says even an enemy
who comes home is a guest.

827
01:31:39.208 --> 01:31:43.542 line:82%
And a guest should not be humiliated.
Otherwise, even I can beat you.

828
01:31:44.667 --> 01:31:45.625 line:82%
Really?

829
01:31:47.333 --> 01:31:49.333 line:82%
Give me the ID card!

830
01:31:51.042 --> 01:31:55.417 line:82%
Please don't take it from me!

831
01:31:56.125 --> 01:32:00.125 line:82%
Doesn't matter if you've taken it.
Leave me. I'm scared of heights.

832
01:32:02.958 --> 01:32:04.333 line:82%
What is the matter?

833
01:32:09.083 --> 01:32:10.958 line:82%
Bablu.
Manu.

834
01:32:12.417 --> 01:32:14.667 line:82%
Bablu.
Manu.

835
01:32:16.042 --> 01:32:17.208 line:82%
Bablu.
Manu.

836
01:32:17.875 --> 01:32:20.000 line:82%
Now I will live like Bablu.

837
01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:22.583 line:82%
And you will die Manu's death.

838
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000 line:82%
If you don't die at the hands
of the police, I'll kill you.

839
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:36.250 line:82%
But first, let me take revenge
from all my enemies.

840
01:32:37.417 --> 01:32:39.375 line:82%
And get my booty back.

841
01:32:48.583 --> 01:32:52.667 line:82%
You can't live for long on my card.

842
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.667 line:82%
Someday the police will find out the truth
about you.

843
01:32:56.833 --> 01:33:00.542 line:82%
Because this ID card
has the imprint of my thumb.

844
01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:05.500 line:82%
Your thumb impression will
be different from mine.

845
01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:16.542 line:82%
-You are right.
-Then?

846
01:33:16.792 --> 01:33:21.333 line:82%
You are not as stupid as you look.

847
01:33:24.167 --> 01:33:27.625 line:82%
Our faces resemble each other.

848
01:33:29.208 --> 01:33:31.542 line:82%
But thumb impressions are different.

849
01:33:34.083 --> 01:33:37.259 line:82%
Let's remove that difference too.

850
01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.708 line:82%
Isn't it burning?

851
01:33:57.375 --> 01:33:58.583 line:82%
What are you doing?

852
01:33:59.375 --> 01:34:04.250 line:82%
Don't do this.
It will hurt! Mom!

853
01:34:05.167 --> 01:34:07.099 line:82%
There's no sign of Manu
who escaped from jail.

854
01:34:08.833 --> 01:34:11.375 line:82%
I haven't understood what's happening.

855
01:34:15.292 --> 01:34:18.917 line:82%
Sonia.
I feel like...

856
01:34:19.333 --> 01:34:22.292 line:82%
Manu and Bablu are one man.

857
01:34:23.375 --> 01:34:28.458 line:82%
He pretended to pick a job with
our hotel to escape the police.

858
01:34:30.167 --> 01:34:32.208 line:82%
Ravi, you are so suspicious.

859
01:34:32.708 --> 01:34:36.792 line:82%
Bablu knows nothing but cooking.
How can he kill anybody?

860
01:34:37.042 --> 01:34:38.042 line:82%
Sonia, actually--

861
01:34:38.125 --> 01:34:40.500 line:82%
Have you ever seen
the innocent Bablu's eyes?

862
01:34:40.667 --> 01:34:44.917 line:82%
-His eyes?
-Those eyes can only love.

863
01:34:46.958 --> 01:34:51.125 line:82%
-Only love.
-Why should I look into my cook's eyes?

864
01:34:51.542 --> 01:34:56.167 line:82%
But you seem to have looked deep
and close into the cook's eyes.

865
01:34:57.292 --> 01:34:59.333 line:82%
I know what you mean to say.

866
01:34:59.708 --> 01:35:02.292 line:82%
Anyways, I have no time for trivial talk.
I am going.

867
01:35:02.375 --> 01:35:03.750 line:82%
Sonia, where are you going?

868
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:08.625 line:82%
-To Bablu's house.
-Bablu's house? Sonia!

869
01:35:20.375 --> 01:35:23.875 line:82%
Bablu! Open the door.
Sonia is here.

870
01:35:24.042 --> 01:35:26.000 line:82%
-It's me, Sonia!
-Sonia!

871
01:35:29.583 --> 01:35:33.917 line:82%
Bablu! Come out.
I know you are inside.

872
01:35:34.458 --> 01:35:36.542 line:82%
Is she the girl you're
having an affair with?

873
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.542 line:82%
-Bablu, Hurry up!
-Heard she's quite a dish.

874
01:35:42.625 --> 01:35:45.917 line:82%
Let me taste and see.
Take him!

875
01:35:48.625 --> 01:35:53.083 line:82%
If you don't open the door now,
I will... break the window!

876
01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:58.792 line:82%
You took so long, Bablu.
Are you still mad at me?

877
01:36:18.667 --> 01:36:23.083 line:82%
Your mood maybe rotten, Bablu,
but you're wearing good clothes.

878
01:36:32.667 --> 01:36:34.375 line:82%
Now don't sulk, Bablu.

879
01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:36.958 line:82%
Smile for me.

880
01:36:41.667 --> 01:36:43.167 line:82%
I've come to take you.

881
01:36:46.208 --> 01:36:49.333 line:82%
-Where?
-Hotel. Where else?

882
01:36:50.125 --> 01:36:53.292 line:82%
The kitchen is waiting for you.
Let's go.

883
01:36:54.667 --> 01:36:57.667 line:82%
Why the hotel?
Let's stay here, in my house.

884
01:36:58.542 --> 01:37:02.792 line:82%
I'm getting late, Bablu.
Let's go to the hotel.

885
01:37:04.917 --> 01:37:08.458 line:82%
Let's go.
Just a minute.

886
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.500 line:82%
-Soni, Sonia.
-Now what?

887
01:37:12.417 --> 01:37:13.625 line:82%
Let me lock the house.

888
01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:20.583 line:82%
Let's go.

889
01:37:49.167 --> 01:37:51.792 line:82%
Bablu.
Down.

890
01:37:52.375 --> 01:37:53.583 line:82%
Get down.

891
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.375 line:82%
Anita.

892
01:37:58.833 --> 01:38:00.917 line:82%
-Come in. I'll show you.
-Let's go.

893
01:38:09.583 --> 01:38:10.833 line:82%
Do you know, Bablu...

894
01:38:11.458 --> 01:38:15.625 line:82%
...today you're looking...
very macho.

895
01:38:20.375 --> 01:38:23.333 line:82%
You've started again!
What are you doing?

896
01:38:23.417 --> 01:38:26.750 line:82%
-Bablu, Lamba will come...
-If any call comes...

897
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:33.917 line:82%
So you've come?

898
01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:40.292 line:82%
What do you think of yourself?
You come and go as you wish.

899
01:38:46.375 --> 01:38:48.083 line:82%
Why are you staring at me?

900
01:38:49.917 --> 01:38:52.083 line:82%
Rascal, is this your father's...

901
01:38:54.458 --> 01:38:55.625 line:82%
Are you hurt?

902
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.208 line:82%
If you want to work here,
behave properly otherwise get lost--

903
01:39:05.792 --> 01:39:09.167 line:82%
This poor fellow was caught
because of the scoundrel Manu!

904
01:39:10.375 --> 01:39:12.583 line:82%
This won't occur again, isn't it?

905
01:39:14.458 --> 01:39:17.375 line:82%
All right, Sonia.
I accept because you're saying it.

906
01:39:19.375 --> 01:39:20.250 line:82%
Make some tea.

907
01:39:29.417 --> 01:39:31.333 line:82%
You're looking beautiful. Anyway...

908
01:39:33.125 --> 01:39:34.667 line:82%
There were two things...

909
01:39:36.250 --> 01:39:38.958 line:82%
Do you want cold tea or hot?

910
01:39:46.917 --> 01:39:48.625 line:82%
Is tea ever had cold?

911
01:39:57.292 --> 01:39:58.500 line:82%
What have you done?

912
01:40:00.125 --> 01:40:01.667 line:82%
Do you take more sugar?

913
01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:04.000 line:82%
Now I'll speak your language, you dimwit.

914
01:40:04.417 --> 01:40:06.250 line:82%
What do you think of yourself?

915
01:40:08.625 --> 01:40:10.292 line:82%
-What the hell are you?
-Bablu--

916
01:40:10.375 --> 01:40:12.000 line:82%
-Son of a cook!
-Not on the face.

917
01:40:12.833 --> 01:40:15.125 line:82%
I'll knock you out in one punch!

918
01:40:15.333 --> 01:40:19.792 line:82%
-Not on the face. Not on the face.
-Fall at my feet and apologize.

919
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:24.792 line:82%
What is going on, Bablu?
Ravi, come down!

920
01:40:24.875 --> 01:40:26.625 line:82%
How am I supposed to do that?

921
01:40:29.375 --> 01:40:31.208 line:82%
Stop this!
Why are you doing all this?

922
01:40:34.375 --> 01:40:38.459 line:82%
This is my office not an arena
where you can pick fights. You, thug!

923
01:40:43.167 --> 01:40:46.792 line:82%
Sonia, I kept telling him
not to hit me on my face.

924
01:40:46.917 --> 01:40:50.458 line:82%
But he paid no heed.
There's a limit to my patience.

925
01:40:50.667 --> 01:40:54.042 line:82%
-Mr. Lamba, hit me if you wish--
-No.

926
01:40:55.625 --> 01:40:56.458 line:82%
You should go.

927
01:40:56.833 --> 01:40:59.333 line:82%
If it wasn't for Sonia, I would...

928
01:40:59.625 --> 01:41:03.458 line:82%
-Ravi, now you should go.
-Don't go away. Don't leave!

929
01:41:05.667 --> 01:41:07.417 line:82%
What is wrong with you?

930
01:41:07.583 --> 01:41:10.000 line:82%
I'd never seen this form of yours.

931
01:41:10.917 --> 01:41:12.417 line:82%
You were not like this.

932
01:41:50.250 --> 01:41:51.083 line:82%
Mom.

933
01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:56.375 line:82%
Mom.

934
01:42:00.125 --> 01:42:01.292 line:82%
When will you return?

935
01:42:22.042 --> 01:42:24.042 line:82%
Didn't I always tell you, son...

936
01:42:26.125 --> 01:42:29.917 line:82%
Eat well...
exercise.

937
01:42:32.625 --> 01:42:35.000 line:82%
If your body was strong...

938
01:42:36.208 --> 01:42:38.167 line:82%
You were a body builder like your Dad,

939
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.792 line:82%
would Manu and his men dare
break into our house and beat you?

940
01:42:51.125 --> 01:42:54.667 line:82%
Don't worry, Mom.
Don't cry.

941
01:42:56.250 --> 01:42:59.708 line:82%
Mom, I can't bear to see you sad.

942
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:05.750 line:82%
These tears came to your eyes
because of Manu.

943
01:43:07.708 --> 01:43:08.708 line:82%
Now you'll see,

944
01:43:09.958 --> 01:43:14.167 line:82%
me use my brain against him.

945
01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:20.625 line:82%
If he can become Bablu,
can't I become Manu?

946
01:43:21.625 --> 01:43:22.859 line:82%
I can, can't I?

947
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:27.750 line:82%
Now I will play his game
and teach him such a lesson...

948
01:43:28.458 --> 01:43:32.292 line:82%
...that he will apologize
to you on bent knees.

949
01:43:34.958 --> 01:43:36.083 line:82%
This is my promise.

950
01:43:36.917 --> 01:43:41.000 line:82%
I swear by you. Just don't cry.

951
01:43:43.625 --> 01:43:48.042 line:82%
Long live son.
My blessings are with you, son.

952
01:44:40.417 --> 01:44:43.583 line:82%
Put your hand down!
Rascals were sleeping.

953
01:44:46.083 --> 01:44:47.917 line:82%
-Where is Bablu?
-He's sleeping inside, boss.

954
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.042 line:82%
You were sleeping, idiot!

955
01:44:49.167 --> 01:44:51.875 line:82%
Go and find him. Go, go, go.

956
01:44:57.917 --> 01:45:00.708 line:82%
-Bablu!
-Yes. Find him.

957
01:45:07.125 --> 01:45:08.625 line:82%
He's not inside, boss.

958
01:45:12.542 --> 01:45:15.500 line:82%
If he isn't found till evening.

959
01:45:17.042 --> 01:45:20.625 line:82%
Then your corpses
will leave this place.

960
01:45:21.917 --> 01:45:23.417 line:82%
Go!

961
01:45:29.542 --> 01:45:30.625 line:82%
Bablu!

962
01:45:30.958 --> 01:45:35.019 line:82%
-Bablu!
-Yeah, find him. Bablu!

963
01:45:44.042 --> 01:45:46.667 line:82%
Why does he wear a coat in this heat?

964
01:46:01.458 --> 01:46:05.459 line:82%
Anita! Anita, transfer the call to Sonia.

965
01:46:05.875 --> 01:46:10.659 line:82%
-Who is speaking?
-I'm Man-- I'm Bablu.

966
01:46:11.292 --> 01:46:14.792 line:82%
Bablu... Sonia...

967
01:46:23.917 --> 01:46:26.125 line:82%
-Manu.
-Me?

968
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:30.625 line:82%
Fast!

969
01:46:33.292 --> 01:46:34.125 line:82%
Be quick, Manu!

970
01:46:39.542 --> 01:46:41.458 line:82%
-Sonia, Sonia--
-There's a limit for everything.

971
01:46:41.542 --> 01:46:44.208 line:82%
-I tried to stop you but you never listen.
-I told Mr. Lamba... Sonia!

972
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:54.292 line:82%
Who are you? Bablu has just left
that too with Ms. Sonia.

973
01:46:54.458 --> 01:46:57.250 line:82%
No Anita, I am Bablu. Bablu the chef.

974
01:46:57.458 --> 01:46:59.250 line:82%
Don't you remember that I give you
pineapple pastries every day?

975
01:47:00.375 --> 01:47:02.875 line:82%
If you call again, I'll inform the police.

976
01:47:04.875 --> 01:47:06.833 line:82%
-Hello! Hello!
-Manu.

977
01:47:07.792 --> 01:47:09.583 line:82%
-Manu!
-Who's speaking?

978
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.625 line:82%
-Lily
-Which Lily? I was talking to Anita.

979
01:47:15.792 --> 01:47:17.375 line:82%
Anita?
Who is she?

980
01:47:19.708 --> 01:47:23.250 line:82%
-So now there's an Anita in your life.
-There's no Lily or Anita.

981
01:47:23.333 --> 01:47:26.833 line:82%
-Where are you calling from?
-Behind you, Manu.

982
01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:29.875 line:82%
-Behind me?
-Stop the jokes, Manu.

983
01:47:42.875 --> 01:47:44.583 line:82%
-What were you doing here?
-Me?

984
01:47:46.708 --> 01:47:48.750 line:82%
I was just calling you.

985
01:47:48.875 --> 01:47:54.000 line:82%
-I missed you.
-Manu, the police is all around.

986
01:47:54.083 --> 01:47:56.458 line:82%
-That's why I was hidden here.
-Then come soon.

987
01:47:56.667 --> 01:47:57.958 line:82%
What are you doing?

988
01:47:58.583 --> 01:48:01.208 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-It's so dark.

989
01:48:02.333 --> 01:48:05.500 line:82%
Why are you putting your tongue in my ear?
It tickles!

990
01:48:06.208 --> 01:48:10.625 line:82%
What times have come! Television
and films have ruined the country.

991
01:48:23.083 --> 01:48:24.833 line:82%
Manu! Manu!

992
01:48:24.917 --> 01:48:28.292 line:82%
-Come on.
-Repair the car in the garage?

993
01:48:39.667 --> 01:48:41.583 line:82%
What is wrong with you, Manu?

994
01:48:42.125 --> 01:48:43.792 line:82%
What is wrong with me?

995
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:46.125 line:82%
What is wrong with me?

996
01:48:47.208 --> 01:48:48.500 line:82%
Nothing at all.

997
01:48:50.708 --> 01:48:54.292 line:82%
If nothing happened to me in jail,
then what worse can happen now?

998
01:48:55.833 --> 01:48:58.167 line:82%
You guys have bad eye sight.

999
01:49:04.167 --> 01:49:05.375 line:82%
Who is it?

1000
01:49:07.667 --> 01:49:10.417 line:82%
-We made a mistake, Boss.
-Forgive us, Boss.

1001
01:49:11.292 --> 01:49:13.500 line:82%
Bablu escaped somehow, Boss.

1002
01:49:13.583 --> 01:49:15.708 line:82%
We couldn't find him anywhere, Boss.

1003
01:49:17.417 --> 01:49:20.208 line:82%
-Massage my legs!
-Give us one chance.

1004
01:49:20.292 --> 01:49:23.542 line:82%
-Yes, Boss.
-One more chance. I have little children.

1005
01:49:23.875 --> 01:49:27.167 line:82%
-My mother is old. Forgive us, Boss.
-First let go of my feet!

1006
01:49:33.875 --> 01:49:37.958 line:82%
You know Manu gangster
never ever forgives anybody!

1007
01:49:39.292 --> 01:49:40.917 line:82%
And if you have made a mistake...

1008
01:49:41.833 --> 01:49:43.458 line:82%
You will be punished for it.

1009
01:49:45.167 --> 01:49:46.500 line:82%
Get ready.

1010
01:49:46.667 --> 01:49:49.375 line:82%
-Take this.
-What is it?

1011
01:49:52.167 --> 01:49:54.750 line:82%
-How many bullets in it?
-I don't know, sir.

1012
01:49:54.833 --> 01:49:57.250 line:82%
Then why did you give it to me?
Hold it yourself.

1013
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.625 line:82%
Men do make mistakes.

1014
01:50:05.333 --> 01:50:07.875 line:82%
You make mistakes, he does.
So do I.

1015
01:50:08.417 --> 01:50:11.708 line:82%
If Bablu has run away let him!

1016
01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.833 line:82%
I feel there maybe some good in it.

1017
01:50:14.917 --> 01:50:18.167 line:82%
If he has escaped from your hands,
let him go.

1018
01:50:19.375 --> 01:50:22.292 line:82%
You may leave.
Just leave!

1019
01:50:25.292 --> 01:50:26.417 line:82%
Stop!

1020
01:50:32.333 --> 01:50:36.000 line:82%
Now that you are going,
wish your mother on my behalf.

1021
01:50:40.417 --> 01:50:44.125 line:82%
Give your kids these Glucose biscuits.

1022
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:50.792 line:82%
-You are not Manu gangster.
-Don't tell anybody.

1023
01:50:51.625 --> 01:50:53.583 line:82%
-You are an angel!
-You are an angel!

1024
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.000 line:82%
Go away!

1025
01:51:07.583 --> 01:51:09.500 line:82%
You guys should also leave.

1026
01:51:34.875 --> 01:51:37.208 line:82%
Your goodness kills me, Manu.

1027
01:51:37.708 --> 01:51:39.833 line:82%
I'll eat you alive!

1028
01:52:44.083 --> 01:52:47.792 line:82%
Fights and spats
And the way you spat

1029
01:52:48.125 --> 01:52:51.542 line:82%
Let's forget this
What is it going to fetch us?

1030
01:52:51.917 --> 01:52:55.750 line:82%
To be angry over little things

1031
01:52:55.833 --> 01:52:59.000 line:82%
Let's forget this
What is it going to fetch us?

1032
01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:02.917 line:82%
Come, darling
Let's live in peace

1033
01:53:10.958 --> 01:53:14.750 line:82%
You'll say that I'm good
And I'll tell you, you're very good

1034
01:53:30.625 --> 01:53:34.042 line:82%
Come, darling
We'll both live in peace

1035
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:28.333 line:82%
I'll say sorry to you
And you'll say sorry to me

1036
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:36.083 line:82%
Let's not haggle about it
We're both very sorry.

1037
01:54:36.625 --> 01:54:39.917 line:82%
Oh darling
Try to understand what I'm saying

1038
01:54:40.208 --> 01:54:43.708 line:82%
Take me in your arms
When I'm close to you

1039
01:54:47.917 --> 01:54:51.708 line:82%
You'll say thank you to me
And I'll say welcome!

1040
01:54:51.833 --> 01:54:54.667 line:82%
Oh darling
Say that how things will be like

1041
01:55:26.917 --> 01:55:30.667 line:82%
We'll both get married
And a function will be held

1042
01:55:34.542 --> 01:55:38.125 line:82%
The bulb will turn on
And our hearts will be connected

1043
01:55:38.542 --> 01:55:41.917 line:82%
Try to understand what I'm saying
Darling!

1044
01:55:42.333 --> 01:55:46.042 line:82%
Every time I leave the house
You say goodbye to me

1045
01:55:50.667 --> 01:55:53.875 line:82%
When I return
You'll say, darling hi!

1046
01:55:53.958 --> 01:55:57.167 line:82%
Oh darling
Say that how things will be like

1047
01:55:57.958 --> 01:56:01.417 line:82%
Fight and spat
the way you sulk

1048
01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:05.333 line:82%
Let's forget this
What is it going to fetch us?

1049
01:56:05.875 --> 01:56:09.500 line:82%
To be angry over little things

1050
01:56:09.583 --> 01:56:12.917 line:82%
Let's forget this
What is it going to fetch us?

1051
01:56:13.625 --> 01:56:16.958 line:82%
Come, darling
Let's live in peace

1052
01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:28.625 line:82%
You'll say that I'm good
And I'll tell you, you're very good

1053
01:57:11.458 --> 01:57:14.000 line:82%
Cheat! Liar! Savage!

1054
01:57:14.167 --> 01:57:15.875 line:82%
What happened?

1055
01:57:18.417 --> 01:57:20.500 line:82%
Manu! What are you doing?

1056
01:57:20.875 --> 01:57:24.708 line:82%
-I'm... getting out of the car
-Where are you going?

1057
01:57:26.208 --> 01:57:30.417 line:82%
Manu comes of his own sweet will
and leaves when he desires!

1058
01:57:32.042 --> 01:57:35.125 line:82%
-Lily, death lurks.
-Where?

1059
01:57:35.375 --> 01:57:36.250 line:82%
All around us.

1060
01:57:39.917 --> 01:57:41.500 line:82%
Twenty years later!

1061
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:44.833 line:82%
We'll be two feet under the ground!

1062
01:57:45.239 --> 01:57:46.279 line:82%
Screams.

1063
01:57:55.417 --> 01:57:57.625 line:82%
This is my tale of sorrow.

1064
01:57:57.839 --> 01:57:59.159 line:82%
Don't worry, child.

1065
01:58:17.792 --> 01:58:18.917 line:82%
It's him!

1066
01:58:23.458 --> 01:58:25.667 line:82%
Sonia, I am not who you think I am.

1067
01:58:26.625 --> 01:58:29.792 line:82%
And I'm definitely not
what you think I am. What're you--

1068
01:58:30.417 --> 01:58:31.292 line:82%
Sonia.

1069
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.250 line:82%
Don't you dare take my name
with your dirty mouth.

1070
01:58:37.875 --> 01:58:39.083 line:82%
Who? Me?

1071
01:58:39.917 --> 01:58:42.292 line:82%
I am Bablu! Your Bablu!

1072
01:58:42.542 --> 01:58:45.667 line:82%
-Liar!
-Me? A liar?

1073
01:58:45.792 --> 01:58:47.792 line:82%
Manu is a liar not me!

1074
01:58:47.875 --> 01:58:50.625 line:82%
He was roaming with you.
He resembles me.

1075
01:58:51.083 --> 01:58:53.917 line:82%
How much, how much will you lie?

1076
01:59:05.167 --> 01:59:06.750 line:82%
Please believe me.

1077
01:59:10.125 --> 01:59:14.333 line:82%
No! Don't show me your innocent eyes!

1078
01:59:15.167 --> 01:59:17.375 line:82%
These eyes have
deceived me earlier too.

1079
01:59:18.667 --> 01:59:21.708 line:82%
No! You have to look in my eyes!

1080
01:59:22.333 --> 01:59:24.875 line:82%
-No!
-Look into my eyes.

1081
01:59:24.958 --> 01:59:28.958 line:82%
Can these eyes look at you in that way?

1082
01:59:30.042 --> 01:59:33.417 line:82%
Whatever you are,
Bablu, Manu, Baldy!

1083
01:59:33.875 --> 01:59:36.167 line:82%
Leave!
Leave me alone!

1084
01:59:40.542 --> 01:59:45.083 line:82%
So, now I'm Baldy.
But before I leave I must say...

1085
01:59:46.125 --> 01:59:49.500 line:82%
...neither am I Manu nor Baldy.

1086
01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:53.917 line:82%
I am Bablu Chaudhary.
Age 25 years.

1087
01:59:54.875 --> 01:59:57.417 line:82%
OK I'm 26 years old.

1088
01:59:59.417 --> 02:00:01.625 line:82%
And I have three dreams.

1089
02:00:02.542 --> 02:00:07.750 line:82%
My first dream is to make my Mom,
my mother very happy.

1090
02:00:08.375 --> 02:00:12.417 line:82%
My second dream is to become
the greatest chef on earth.

1091
02:00:13.625 --> 02:00:16.750 line:82%
And my third dream is...

1092
02:00:16.833 --> 02:00:21.208 line:82%
...to love Sonia Kapoor a lot!

1093
02:00:22.083 --> 02:00:24.625 line:82%
I want to marry her.

1094
02:00:27.042 --> 02:00:29.458 line:82%
Please forgive him!

1095
02:00:29.583 --> 02:00:31.833 line:82%
No! No!

1096
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.667 line:82%
Till I prove I'm not Manu,

1097
02:00:38.208 --> 02:00:42.292 line:82%
I am Bablu Chaudhary.
I won't show you my face till then.

1098
02:00:51.542 --> 02:00:54.542 line:82%
Why didn't you meet me earlier?

1099
02:01:00.667 --> 02:01:02.250 line:82%
Hug?

1100
02:01:11.667 --> 02:01:14.625 line:82%
-Car.
-Money. Proof!

1101
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.833 line:82%
-I have to go.
-Where?

1102
02:01:17.875 --> 02:01:19.167 line:82%
But I will return.

1103
02:01:28.833 --> 02:01:30.542 line:82%
Come back soon.

1104
02:02:00.625 --> 02:02:02.500 line:82%
Come out, Bablu.

1105
02:02:02.833 --> 02:02:05.333 line:82%
Or I will thrash you.

1106
02:02:13.375 --> 02:02:16.958 line:82%
Shameless! You're so drunk that
you're calling out to yourself.

1107
02:02:18.417 --> 02:02:19.875 line:82%
-Who...?
-Who?

1108
02:02:20.083 --> 02:02:23.917 line:82%
Your mother! You are so drunk
you can't recognize your mother!

1109
02:02:24.958 --> 02:02:28.333 line:82%
I'm your mother.
Shameless!

1110
02:02:28.542 --> 02:02:31.792 line:82%
You've turned your father's name to dust!

1111
02:02:31.875 --> 02:02:35.279 line:82%
Get up! I'll make you sober!

1112
02:02:35.379 --> 02:02:37.959 line:82%
I go on a pilgrimage for you!
Pray and worship for you!

1113
02:02:38.042 --> 02:02:40.919 line:82%
And you drink liquor! Get out!

1114
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.250 line:82%
Shameless! Scoundrel!

1115
02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:49.708 line:82%
Drinks and comes home
to ask me who I am!

1116
02:02:50.083 --> 02:02:53.500 line:82%
Now you know! I'm your Mom!

1117
02:03:24.375 --> 02:03:26.375 line:82%
The engine is heated up.

1118
02:03:26.458 --> 02:03:27.958 line:82%
Shall we check it?

1119
02:03:37.708 --> 02:03:40.583 line:82%
You go in, love.
I'll look after them

1120
02:03:46.292 --> 02:03:48.792 line:82%
Bablu has escaped.

1121
02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:54.833 line:82%
I got beat up by an old woman
but Manu will never lose. Never lose.

1122
02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.417 line:82%
Shalaku, now it's your turn.

1123
02:04:11.167 --> 02:04:13.833 line:82%
Manu, come over.

1124
02:04:15.625 --> 02:04:18.625 line:82%
You've walked into the jaws of death.
Now, you can't be saved.

1125
02:04:27.875 --> 02:04:30.458 line:82%
You testified against me.

1126
02:04:30.792 --> 02:04:34.375 line:82%
Now you won't be fit to do anything.

1127
02:04:40.958 --> 02:04:42.500 line:82%
-Rascal!
-Shalaku!

1128
02:04:48.208 --> 02:04:51.583 line:82%
Lily, go out.
Somebody bring me my clothes.

1129
02:05:05.542 --> 02:05:07.917 line:82%
No, he can't come to the phone.
He is naked.

1130
02:05:12.417 --> 02:05:13.250 line:82%
Manu!

1131
02:05:18.583 --> 02:05:20.542 line:82%
Down Manu!
Manu!

1132
02:05:22.559 --> 02:05:25.079 line:82%
Down Manu!
Manu, the other way!

1133
02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:36.125 line:82%
Shalaku, don't come out of the water,
otherwise...

1134
02:05:36.208 --> 02:05:38.042 line:82%
What will you do?
Shoot me?

1135
02:05:38.125 --> 02:05:39.750 line:82%
You're not wearing anything pal!

1136
02:05:41.708 --> 02:05:44.792 line:82%
The Lord gives in plenty!

1137
02:05:45.292 --> 02:05:47.292 line:82%
Don't touch it. That's my money!

1138
02:05:47.375 --> 02:05:49.917 line:82%
Then come and take it.
Manu...

1139
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.292 line:82%
-Lily, where's the bag?
-You have it.

1140
02:05:53.917 --> 02:05:55.750 line:82%
Shalaku, do you have a bag?

1141
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.708 line:82%
He's so useless. I'll find something.
Found it.

1142
02:06:30.458 --> 02:06:31.833 line:82%
Shalaku!

1143
02:06:40.917 --> 02:06:44.625 line:82%
I knew it! I did.

1144
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.458 line:82%
You would try to kill me
after taking all my money.

1145
02:06:54.167 --> 02:06:56.042 line:82%
Have you gone mad, Shalaku?

1146
02:06:57.333 --> 02:06:58.958 line:82%
Why are you inviting death?

1147
02:06:59.875 --> 02:07:02.667 line:82%
Quietly hand over
my share of the booty!

1148
02:07:02.958 --> 02:07:05.833 line:82%
Your share? Are you mad?

1149
02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.167 line:82%
Have you lost your memory?

1150
02:07:08.292 --> 02:07:09.833 line:82%
Remember?

1151
02:07:10.167 --> 02:07:15.417 line:82%
Just 10 minutes ago with that girl,
taking advantage of my nudity,

1152
02:07:15.542 --> 02:07:16.917 line:82%
You ran away with all my money.

1153
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.542 line:82%
-What money?
-You tell me.

1154
02:07:19.875 --> 02:07:21.583 line:82%
Your father will answer.

1155
02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:36.833 line:82%
-Why are you laughing?
-Hoodwinked!

1156
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.250 line:82%
We got tricked.

1157
02:07:40.667 --> 02:07:43.833 line:82%
Who? Who hoodwinked us?

1158
02:07:43.917 --> 02:07:48.292 line:82%
The biggest fool of the world.
Bablu!

1159
02:07:49.542 --> 02:07:51.958 line:82%
He took off with our booty.

1160
02:07:52.042 --> 02:07:56.125 line:82%
And Shalako and Manu gangster
were left clapping.

1161
02:08:00.833 --> 02:08:05.250 line:82%
Just think.
If I had stolen your money...

1162
02:08:06.083 --> 02:08:09.500 line:82%
...wouldn't I have taken
your life too, as interest?

1163
02:08:10.375 --> 02:08:15.083 line:82%
This hand of yours which
doesn't have a death line...

1164
02:08:16.708 --> 02:08:19.250 line:82%
...wouldn't I have drawn one?

1165
02:10:03.708 --> 02:10:05.708 line:82%
When did I imagine this?

1166
02:10:07.958 --> 02:10:09.792 line:82%
When did I know this?

1167
02:10:12.375 --> 02:10:14.333 line:82%
When did I think of this?

1168
02:10:14.417 --> 02:10:16.083 line:82%
When did I know this?

1169
02:10:16.292 --> 02:10:18.542 line:82%
That you'd change this much

1170
02:10:18.625 --> 02:10:20.250 line:82%
That you'd want me this much

1171
02:10:20.333 --> 02:10:22.208 line:82%
That you'd love me this much

1172
02:10:22.458 --> 02:10:24.167 line:82%
That you'd express it like this

1173
02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:27.125 line:82%
My beloved, my darling

1174
02:10:28.375 --> 02:10:31.708 line:82%
Thank you, it's your doing

1175
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:34.875 line:82%
This kindness in your eyes was

1176
02:11:35.458 --> 02:11:38.625 line:82%
Never there before

1177
02:11:39.583 --> 02:11:42.917 line:82%
This passion in your breathe

1178
02:11:43.792 --> 02:11:47.917 line:82%
Was never there before

1179
02:11:48.208 --> 02:11:50.042 line:82%
It didn't spread like this

1180
02:11:52.417 --> 02:11:54.759 line:82%
The cloud of your hair

1181
02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:02.375 line:82%
The breeze cast by your scarf

1182
02:12:02.458 --> 02:12:04.667 line:82%
Was never so fragrant

1183
02:12:04.958 --> 02:12:08.417 line:82%
Never have had you such styles

1184
02:12:08.833 --> 02:12:11.333 line:82%
What a beautiful outrage this is!

1185
02:12:12.833 --> 02:12:16.292 line:82%
Thank you, it's all your doing

1186
02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:50.417 line:82%
Never before was the magic

1187
02:12:50.625 --> 02:12:54.125 line:82%
Of my love at work upon you

1188
02:12:54.750 --> 02:12:58.708 line:82%
The way heart is out of control right now

1189
02:12:58.958 --> 02:13:02.042 line:82%
This has never happened before

1190
02:13:03.333 --> 02:13:05.333 line:82%
This never happened before,

1191
02:13:07.542 --> 02:13:10.083 line:82%
The way you talk about love

1192
02:13:15.833 --> 02:13:19.542 line:82%
I'm amazed listening
To this gentleman's words

1193
02:13:19.958 --> 02:13:23.833 line:82%
Whether you're accepting me
Or refusing me

1194
02:13:23.917 --> 02:13:26.750 line:82%
At least you've brought up the subject!

1195
02:13:28.167 --> 02:13:31.208 line:82%
Thank you, it's all your doing

1196
02:13:32.375 --> 02:13:35.458 line:82%
My beloved, my darling

1197
02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:40.125 line:82%
Thank you, it's all your doing

1198
02:14:31.708 --> 02:14:33.542 line:82%
Bablu!

1199
02:14:34.083 --> 02:14:36.333 line:82%
Seems furious.
He'll beat me hard.

1200
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:44.667 line:82%
Boss, Bablu has been found.

1201
02:14:45.833 --> 02:14:48.958 line:82%
I'm not Bablu. I'm Manu.

1202
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:55.125 line:82%
Stand straight
or I'll shoot your head off.

1203
02:14:55.792 --> 02:14:59.083 line:82%
I'll...
come from there.

1204
02:15:00.833 --> 02:15:02.000 line:82%
Put on the jacket.

1205
02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.500 line:82%
Everybody clear out!

1206
02:15:06.708 --> 02:15:08.292 line:82%
I mean, grab him.

1207
02:15:15.708 --> 02:15:19.042 line:82%
-So Bablu has come?
-Hey shut up!

1208
02:15:20.292 --> 02:15:23.417 line:82%
I am not Bablu! You are!

1209
02:15:24.542 --> 02:15:27.750 line:82%
Stand still!
Don't even try to disrespect the boss.

1210
02:15:28.458 --> 02:15:33.083 line:82%
Brothers, so he says he is Manu
and I am Bablu.

1211
02:15:36.708 --> 02:15:38.458 line:82%
OK, we'll see.

1212
02:15:40.292 --> 02:15:42.167 line:82%
Hold him tight, guys.

1213
02:15:42.875 --> 02:15:44.292 line:82%
What are you guys doing?

1214
02:15:44.667 --> 02:15:46.583 line:82%
Hold him and check his pockets.

1215
02:15:47.333 --> 02:15:49.750 line:82%
Yeah, check his pockets.
Yeah, down there.

1216
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:57.042 line:82%
Throw it here.

1217
02:16:00.417 --> 02:16:02.917 line:82%
This is a police identity card.

1218
02:16:04.333 --> 02:16:09.208 line:82%
This very clearly says that
you are Bablu Chaudhary.

1219
02:16:09.458 --> 02:16:14.833 line:82%
Because if I was Bablu,
I would have this card.

1220
02:16:16.333 --> 02:16:19.500 line:82%
But in whose pocket was this found?

1221
02:16:19.583 --> 02:16:22.125 line:82%
-His!
-So who is he?

1222
02:16:22.375 --> 02:16:23.208 line:82%
Bablu!

1223
02:16:24.125 --> 02:16:26.292 line:82%
-And who am I?
-Manu!

1224
02:16:26.458 --> 02:16:28.542 line:82%
-Once more, who is he?
-Bablu!

1225
02:16:28.625 --> 02:16:30.000 line:82%
-Who am I?
-Manu!

1226
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:33.167 line:82%
Have a look.

1227
02:16:37.958 --> 02:16:40.125 line:82%
These fools don't recognize me.

1228
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:43.250 line:82%
But you will know me.

1229
02:16:43.875 --> 02:16:45.958 line:82%
I'm your Manu. He's Bablu.

1230
02:16:47.250 --> 02:16:48.667 line:82%
I'm Bablu. He's Manu.
No way.

1231
02:16:51.125 --> 02:16:54.875 line:82%
Lily, I'm Manu. Take it easy.
I'm Manu.

1232
02:17:08.917 --> 02:17:12.458 line:82%
-Manu.
-Yes, your Manu.

1233
02:17:22.250 --> 02:17:24.125 line:82%
You act very well.

1234
02:17:46.417 --> 02:17:51.458 line:82%
Enough.
Now you all can... leave.

1235
02:17:52.292 --> 02:17:54.708 line:82%
Take him along.

1236
02:17:56.333 --> 02:17:59.875 line:82%
It will prove very dear.
You'll have to pay for making me Bablu.

1237
02:18:00.417 --> 02:18:02.125 line:82%
Now what will be your fate, Manu?

1238
02:18:05.125 --> 02:18:06.417 line:82%
Bablu.

1239
02:18:10.542 --> 02:18:15.875 line:82%
-Don't come back!
-You won't leave alive if you do, rascal!

1240
02:18:19.208 --> 02:18:23.739 line:82%
Manu gangster has been humiliated a lot.
You've been insulted!

1241
02:18:24.167 --> 02:18:27.417 line:82%
It will turn out very dear
turning me into Bablu, Bablu!

1242
02:18:32.042 --> 02:18:35.833 line:82%
Swear by mother...
now you're dead meat.

1243
02:19:11.333 --> 02:19:12.667 line:82%
Mother.

1244
02:19:15.458 --> 02:19:19.167 line:82%
Turned sober? Or still intoxicated?

1245
02:19:20.042 --> 02:19:22.583 line:82%
Wearing such funny and dark clothes.

1246
02:19:22.792 --> 02:19:25.208 line:82%
And calling me mother instead of Mom.

1247
02:19:27.708 --> 02:19:29.208 line:82%
Mom!

1248
02:19:33.958 --> 02:19:36.042 line:82%
I made a big mistake last night.

1249
02:19:36.958 --> 02:19:38.875 line:82%
Won't you forgive your son?

1250
02:19:40.167 --> 02:19:42.792 line:82%
A mother forgives her enemy, too, son.

1251
02:19:43.208 --> 02:19:46.542 line:82%
But you're my son, my baby.

1252
02:19:48.333 --> 02:19:51.250 line:82%
See, I bought you a lovely suit.

1253
02:19:51.625 --> 02:19:54.579 line:82%
-Quickly wear it and get ready.
-Why did you buy such a costly one?

1254
02:19:56.417 --> 02:20:00.500 line:82%
If you want me to get what I want...

1255
02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000 line:82%
...then you have to come with me.

1256
02:20:03.292 --> 02:20:06.292 line:82%
I will come,
my son but where do we have to go?

1257
02:20:07.875 --> 02:20:09.500 line:82%
To bring treasure.

1258
02:20:10.125 --> 02:20:11.167 line:82%
Treasure?

1259
02:20:11.500 --> 02:20:15.333 line:82%
-I mean, your future daughter-in-law.
-Oh my God, really?

1260
02:20:15.417 --> 02:20:19.333 line:82%
But she says she won't even
meet me unless you're with me.

1261
02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:22.917 line:82%
She will definitely meet you.
I will come with you!

1262
02:20:23.667 --> 02:20:25.625 line:82%
I'll get ready quickly, my son.

1263
02:20:33.208 --> 02:20:35.708 line:82%
-Hello.
-This is Manu.

1264
02:20:39.792 --> 02:20:44.792 line:82%
My den is in your hands.
My men became yours.

1265
02:20:45.208 --> 02:20:47.625 line:82%
Even Lily is with you.

1266
02:20:48.250 --> 02:20:51.500 line:82%
But doesn't matter because...

1267
02:20:54.625 --> 02:20:57.083 line:82%
-...your Mom is with me.
-No!

1268
02:20:57.292 --> 02:21:02.708 line:82%
If you don't come to Gate 1 of the Docks,
right now...

1269
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:09.375 line:82%
...I will shred your Mom to pieces.

1270
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.167 line:82%
-No, Manu...
-Hurry up. The meter is running.

1271
02:21:15.458 --> 02:21:17.917 line:82%
Did you hear my Mom's voice?

1272
02:21:18.417 --> 02:21:20.417 line:82%
-Come fast.
-Mom...

1273
02:21:20.917 --> 02:21:21.833 line:82%
Treasure.

1274
02:21:29.917 --> 02:21:33.375 line:82%
Please leave my Mom alone, Manu.

1275
02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:40.333 line:82%
-Stop the car quickly, Ravi.
-Be quick. The meter is running.

1276
02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.042 line:82%
Bablu!

1277
02:21:46.583 --> 02:21:48.458 line:82%
She will definitely meet you.
I will come with you!

1278
02:21:48.542 --> 02:21:49.739 line:82%
Hello!
Manu.

1279
02:21:55.583 --> 02:21:57.292 line:82%
So, you are Bablu.

1280
02:21:59.792 --> 02:22:02.125 line:82%
-Yes.
-What was Manu saying?

1281
02:22:08.083 --> 02:22:10.375 line:82%
He was saying...

1282
02:22:11.667 --> 02:22:16.667 line:82%
...that my Mom,
my mother is in his hands.

1283
02:22:20.083 --> 02:22:22.458 line:82%
I want to ask you just one question.

1284
02:22:24.417 --> 02:22:29.000 line:82%
Why did he have to drag my mother
in this fight between us men?

1285
02:22:31.208 --> 02:22:33.083 line:82%
Even I am his enemy.

1286
02:22:34.542 --> 02:22:37.083 line:82%
But did I ever misbehave with you?

1287
02:22:39.208 --> 02:22:44.292 line:82%
Did I take advantage of the fact
that you think I am Manu?

1288
02:22:52.208 --> 02:22:54.042 line:82%
Even today if I wish...

1289
02:22:55.042 --> 02:22:58.750 line:82%
...I can take you along
and free my Mom.

1290
02:23:02.917 --> 02:23:06.708 line:82%
But my mother taught me that...

1291
02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:12.792 line:82%
...good people respect women.

1292
02:23:29.708 --> 02:23:31.625 line:82%
Halt.

1293
02:23:35.625 --> 02:23:37.083 line:82%
Get lost.

1294
02:23:38.792 --> 02:23:42.958 line:82%
Good God! What a desolate place
you've brought me to Bablu?

1295
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:45.833 line:82%
Does your wealth live in these ruins?

1296
02:23:48.125 --> 02:23:51.500 line:82%
-She doesn't live here, Mom.
-Then?

1297
02:23:53.208 --> 02:23:56.042 line:82%
She is going to come here.

1298
02:23:58.167 --> 02:24:00.417 line:82%
She's going to come?

1299
02:24:03.625 --> 02:24:04.667 line:82%
She's here!

1300
02:24:10.083 --> 02:24:11.167 line:82%
Bablu!

1301
02:24:13.542 --> 02:24:16.750 line:82%
Where were you? Do you know we have
been looking for you since two days?

1302
02:24:16.833 --> 02:24:18.333 line:82%
We were so worried.

1303
02:24:18.625 --> 02:24:20.958 line:82%
We looked here and there, everywhere.

1304
02:24:31.292 --> 02:24:33.750 line:82%
My daughter-in-law is so pretty!

1305
02:24:33.833 --> 02:24:36.939 line:82%
-And she jabbers in English so well!
-Mom?

1306
02:24:41.167 --> 02:24:43.542 line:82%
-Mother-in-law.
-Do well and prosper, child.

1307
02:24:47.792 --> 02:24:48.708 line:82%
What's the matter?

1308
02:24:51.083 --> 02:24:53.625 line:82%
How do you know this is Bablu?

1309
02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.583 line:82%
His mother is with him.

1310
02:24:59.667 --> 02:25:01.458 line:82%
I'll get it confirmed for you.

1311
02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.167 line:82%
Mother, this is our General Manager,
Mr. Lamba

1312
02:25:08.958 --> 02:25:12.417 line:82%
Ravi, touch her feet.
Do it!

1313
02:25:19.292 --> 02:25:21.125 line:82%
Live long, son.

1314
02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:24.125 line:82%
I'll take leave.

1315
02:25:25.083 --> 02:25:27.667 line:82%
Far away from your life.

1316
02:25:32.333 --> 02:25:33.458 line:82%
-Lamba!
-Yes?

1317
02:25:33.792 --> 02:25:34.750 line:82%
Listen...

1318
02:25:37.292 --> 02:25:38.583 line:82%
Thank you so much, brother.

1319
02:25:39.292 --> 02:25:41.958 line:82%
-You've helped me so much--
-Enough!

1320
02:25:45.792 --> 02:25:47.333 line:82%
-Brother?
-Yes?

1321
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:52.792 line:82%
Bye, brother.

1322
02:26:01.499 --> 02:26:02.379 line:82%
Brother?

1323
02:26:17.333 --> 02:26:19.333 line:82%
Fast! Quick!

1324
02:26:21.875 --> 02:26:25.750 line:82%
Look, plan one, you go right.
Plan two, you go left.

1325
02:26:26.042 --> 02:26:28.292 line:82%
Right not left. Any questions?

1326
02:26:29.917 --> 02:26:31.750 line:82%
One question, where will you go?

1327
02:26:32.458 --> 02:26:34.417 line:82%
I will go up.

1328
02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:36.333 line:82%
-And me?
-You'll go left.

1329
02:26:38.208 --> 02:26:41.958 line:82%
Plan number three is,
if you see Bablu anywhere,

1330
02:26:42.042 --> 02:26:43.667 line:82%
pounce on him and catch him.

1331
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:46.250 line:82%
-And if we don't see him?
-Keep looking for him, man.

1332
02:26:48.583 --> 02:26:49.667 line:82%
Now, go.

1333
02:26:55.542 --> 02:26:56.375 line:82%
Manu!

1334
02:27:05.833 --> 02:27:06.708 line:82%
Mom.

1335
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:09.625 line:82%
Mom.

1336
02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.083 line:82%
Where has she gone?

1337
02:27:36.333 --> 02:27:37.625 line:82%
Brought the money?

1338
02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:40.583 line:82%
Here.

1339
02:27:42.917 --> 02:27:45.792 line:82%
Now, hang the bag on the pulley.

1340
02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.667 line:82%
No, first tell me where Mom is.

1341
02:27:49.250 --> 02:27:53.583 line:82%
Your Mom is talking
to her future daughter-in-law.

1342
02:27:54.208 --> 02:27:56.792 line:82%
-What?
-Look there.

1343
02:27:59.958 --> 02:28:02.458 line:82%
-Mom...
-Tell me what can you cook.

1344
02:28:03.792 --> 02:28:08.875 line:82%
I can't cook anything but I know
how to make lists of food items.

1345
02:28:09.792 --> 02:28:13.167 line:82%
-Sonia. Mom--
-Put the money on the pulley.

1346
02:28:13.458 --> 02:28:16.042 line:82%
-OK, just a minute.
-Hurry up!

1347
02:28:18.292 --> 02:28:19.667 line:82%
Pull it.

1348
02:28:21.333 --> 02:28:24.000 line:82%
You are very foolish, Bablu.

1349
02:28:25.125 --> 02:28:27.667 line:82%
You have washed your hands off this money.

1350
02:28:28.875 --> 02:28:30.000 line:82%
Also your Sonia.

1351
02:28:30.875 --> 02:28:33.167 line:82%
And Mom too.

1352
02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:38.292 line:82%
-What do you mean?
-The meaning is clear.

1353
02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.292 line:82%
This is the gun...
and you the target.

1354
02:28:45.583 --> 02:28:47.250 line:82%
This bullet.

1355
02:28:49.708 --> 02:28:51.458 line:82%
And your chest.

1356
02:28:56.917 --> 02:29:01.708 line:82%
Now Bablu will die and Manu...
will enjoy.

1357
02:29:04.125 --> 02:29:07.667 line:82%
I will also marry your Sonia.

1358
02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:11.042 line:82%
You cheat! I won't let this happen.

1359
02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:19.667 line:82%
My mother-in-law gave me these bangles
and huge ear rings.

1360
02:29:19.958 --> 02:29:21.083 line:82%
Here!

1361
02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:25.458 line:82%
Will you be my daughter-in-law?
God is great!

1362
02:29:25.667 --> 02:29:27.208 line:82%
Scream!

1363
02:29:28.375 --> 02:29:29.750 line:82%
Wait, what're you doing?

1364
02:29:31.167 --> 02:29:32.000 line:82%
Mom!

1365
02:29:33.417 --> 02:29:34.375 line:82%
Sonia!

1366
02:29:38.083 --> 02:29:39.000 line:82%
Mom!

1367
02:29:46.667 --> 02:29:48.458 line:82%
The fish is trapped in the bait!

1368
02:30:12.458 --> 02:30:14.542 line:82%
Bablu, you can't escape now!

1369
02:30:14.625 --> 02:30:17.042 line:82%
I'm not Bablu.
I am your Manu!

1370
02:30:21.833 --> 02:30:24.542 line:82%
There he runs! Go and nab him!

1371
02:30:28.792 --> 02:30:29.625 line:82%
-Bablu!
-Bablu!

1372
02:30:29.708 --> 02:30:31.167 line:82%
He's hanging!

1373
02:30:31.417 --> 02:30:33.792 line:82%
Looks like he is trapped!

1374
02:30:38.208 --> 02:30:40.792 line:82%
-Where is Manu?
-We're gonna find--

1375
02:30:40.958 --> 02:30:42.000 line:82%
There he is!

1376
02:30:43.375 --> 02:30:45.500 line:82%
Come on, Inspector!
Be quick. Look there he is.

1377
02:30:46.125 --> 02:30:49.375 line:82%
We've surrounded you from below.
Don't try any stupidity!

1378
02:30:50.958 --> 02:30:54.542 line:82%
Rascal, I'm hanging in mid-air.
What could be more stupid?

1379
02:30:56.917 --> 02:30:59.000 line:82%
-Bablu, my son, why are you hanging?
-Shoot him!

1380
02:30:59.583 --> 02:31:03.750 line:82%
-Lamba, tell the police not to fire!
-We'll pull him up. Wait!

1381
02:31:04.250 --> 02:31:06.750 line:82%
Idiot! He's Bablu not Manu!

1382
02:31:08.375 --> 02:31:11.375 line:82%
It's not my job to find out
whether he's Manu or Bablu!

1383
02:31:11.625 --> 02:31:13.917 line:82%
It's your job.

1384
02:31:16.333 --> 02:31:18.583 line:82%
Mom!
Sonia!

1385
02:31:22.375 --> 02:31:25.917 line:82%
What are they doing there?
Helping the wrong man!

1386
02:31:27.958 --> 02:31:30.292 line:82%
Pull! Pull me up.

1387
02:31:30.958 --> 02:31:32.792 line:82%
Sir, shall we check his ID card?

1388
02:31:33.333 --> 02:31:36.750 line:82%
Idiot, you'll check the ID card
of a man hanging for his life.

1389
02:31:40.542 --> 02:31:44.208 line:82%
If you had caught one of the two,
wouldn't the confusion be reduced?

1390
02:31:48.583 --> 02:31:50.500 line:82%
Come carefully.

1391
02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.333 line:82%
-Why were you hanging from there?
-Are you all right?

1392
02:31:55.583 --> 02:31:59.917 line:82%
You've grown so big
yet you have no sense.

1393
02:32:06.292 --> 02:32:08.083 line:82%
-Bablu!
-Manu!

1394
02:32:08.167 --> 02:32:09.250 line:82%
Where am I caught!

1395
02:32:11.042 --> 02:32:13.375 line:82%
Come here! Where are you running off!

1396
02:32:14.333 --> 02:32:17.667 line:82%
-Stupid! Rascal!
-Stop it, Sonia!

1397
02:32:17.833 --> 02:32:20.750 line:82%
Why are you beating me, Mom?
Sonia, Mom...

1398
02:32:21.292 --> 02:32:25.625 line:82%
What are you doing, Mom?
Don't you recognize your own son?

1399
02:32:25.708 --> 02:32:28.250 line:82%
He's Manu and you're beating me!

1400
02:32:31.625 --> 02:32:35.708 line:82%
My son! My love!
Please forgive me!

1401
02:32:35.792 --> 02:32:38.875 line:82%
That is why I wondered why he brought me
to this wilderness, you cheat!

1402
02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.667 line:82%
Not just a cheat...

1403
02:32:43.375 --> 02:32:46.708 line:82%
...I'm much worse than that!

1404
02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:54.750 line:82%
You haven't...
seen the real me.

1405
02:32:57.375 --> 02:32:58.917 line:82%
What do you mean?

1406
02:33:06.125 --> 02:33:08.417 line:82%
The meaning is clear, Bablu.

1407
02:33:09.792 --> 02:33:13.833 line:82%
The police whom you have called
to arrest me...

1408
02:33:14.375 --> 02:33:19.875 line:82%
...you will go to them yourself
and say that you...

1409
02:33:19.958 --> 02:33:22.333 line:82%
...are Manu dada.

1410
02:33:23.667 --> 02:33:26.208 line:82%
Otherwise this girl of yours--

1411
02:33:27.208 --> 02:33:29.042 line:82%
This new bride,

1412
02:33:29.542 --> 02:33:32.500 line:82%
and this old Mom...

1413
02:33:33.542 --> 02:33:37.875 line:82%
...I'll riddle them with bullets!

1414
02:33:38.667 --> 02:33:40.000 line:82%
Understood!

1415
02:33:42.208 --> 02:33:48.167 line:82%
Well done, Manu dada! I had heard
that even thieves keep their word,

1416
02:33:48.917 --> 02:33:51.083 line:82%
but you turned out to be worse than them.

1417
02:33:51.792 --> 02:33:56.042 line:82%
Remember you had said,
if you get your money...

1418
02:33:57.125 --> 02:34:00.208 line:82%
...you would free my Sonia and Mom.

1419
02:34:00.292 --> 02:34:03.833 line:82%
Really?
Did I say that?

1420
02:34:05.958 --> 02:34:11.708 line:82%
Fine. You take both of them with you.

1421
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:30.792 line:82%
Manu! If you want to be spared,
send both these women towards me.

1422
02:34:30.998 --> 02:34:33.198 line:82%
Mom, you take Sonia and leave.

1423
02:34:35.708 --> 02:34:37.750 line:82%
How can I leave them?

1424
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:42.833 line:82%
These two are Manu gangster's tickets
to freedom.

1425
02:34:44.833 --> 02:34:47.583 line:82%
Look, don't act smart!

1426
02:34:47.667 --> 02:34:50.417 line:82%
Or all these guys will shoot at you!

1427
02:34:51.250 --> 02:34:54.083 line:82%
Alright, shoot me if you want.

1428
02:34:55.125 --> 02:34:58.917 line:82%
Manu is not afraid of bullets.

1429
02:35:00.542 --> 02:35:01.708 line:82%
Shoot!

1430
02:35:03.958 --> 02:35:05.958 line:82%
I will only count to seven.

1431
02:35:06.333 --> 02:35:09.667 line:82%
And if you don't leave them by then...

1432
02:35:10.917 --> 02:35:12.625 line:82%
...I'll shoot!

1433
02:35:13.167 --> 02:35:15.458 line:82%
Sonia, take Mom and go.

1434
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:21.333 line:82%
You can't escape.
You have no other option.

1435
02:35:22.167 --> 02:35:24.833 line:82%
Your game is up, Manu.

1436
02:35:25.917 --> 02:35:28.292 line:82%
-One!
-Please go, Sonia.

1437
02:35:31.583 --> 02:35:32.792 line:82%
Two!

1438
02:35:40.042 --> 02:35:43.458 line:82%
-Three!
-Mom, take Sonia and go!

1439
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:44.708 line:82%
Bablu...

1440
02:35:46.083 --> 02:35:47.042 line:82%
Four!

1441
02:35:53.250 --> 02:35:55.417 line:82%
-Five.
-Go!

1442
02:35:57.417 --> 02:35:59.792 line:82%
Gourd?
Wait, what is...

1443
02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:02.708 line:82%
-Spinach, cabbage and tomatoes.
-Six!

1444
02:36:08.875 --> 02:36:11.417 line:82%
-Go for my sake, Mom!
-Seven!

1445
02:36:25.167 --> 02:36:26.500 line:82%
Don't move!

1446
02:36:29.875 --> 02:36:33.875 line:82%
Bablu!
Where is my money?

1447
02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:38.875 line:82%
I don't have any money.

1448
02:36:39.333 --> 02:36:41.500 line:82%
-You took it.
-No!

1449
02:36:41.958 --> 02:36:47.417 line:82%
You deceived me. You gave me tomatoes,
radish, and carrots not my money!

1450
02:36:48.167 --> 02:36:49.750 line:82%
Even bitter gourd.

1451
02:36:53.292 --> 02:36:57.083 line:82%
So, my plan has been successful!

1452
02:36:58.125 --> 02:37:00.250 line:82%
What do you mean?

1453
02:37:01.958 --> 02:37:04.542 line:82%
Manu dada, the meaning is...

1454
02:37:06.042 --> 02:37:07.917 line:82%
Come with me, Mom and Sonia.

1455
02:37:08.292 --> 02:37:10.625 line:82%
Move, let fresh air through.

1456
02:37:11.458 --> 02:37:17.417 line:82%
Have you heard, the child is with you
and you're searching the city?

1457
02:37:18.958 --> 02:37:20.583 line:82%
See!

1458
02:37:26.792 --> 02:37:31.750 line:82%
Mom, did you see the wonder
of my eight grams of brain?

1459
02:37:31.833 --> 02:37:35.375 line:82%
Well done, my son!
God bless you!

1460
02:37:51.292 --> 02:37:53.875 line:82%
Now you're in my hands.

1461
02:37:57.125 --> 02:37:58.292 line:82%
Not yet!

1462
02:38:12.917 --> 02:38:16.750 line:82%
-Kill him!
-My Bablu! Which is my son?

1463
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:28.542 line:82%
Any suggestions Miss English?

1464
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:34.833 line:82%
Whom do we fire at?
We must know who is who.

1465
02:38:34.917 --> 02:38:36.583 line:82%
I am Bablu.

1466
02:38:37.625 --> 02:38:40.458 line:82%
-No, I'm Bablu.
-No, I'm Bablu.

1467
02:38:47.958 --> 02:38:49.208 line:82%
Stop it!

1468
02:38:51.542 --> 02:38:52.792 line:82%
Who will tell?

1469
02:38:52.875 --> 02:38:55.542 line:82%
I will tell since I'm the mother.

1470
02:38:55.833 --> 02:38:58.417 line:82%
A mother can find her real son.

1471
02:38:59.417 --> 02:39:00.667 line:82%
Hold my hand, Bablu.

1472
02:39:14.458 --> 02:39:19.375 line:82%
The blood of his ancestors
flow through my son's veins.

1473
02:39:20.875 --> 02:39:22.208 line:82%
He is the son of a wrestler.

1474
02:39:23.583 --> 02:39:25.167 line:82%
He is not weak.

1475
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:30.375 line:82%
The one who can pull me towards him,
with his strength...

1476
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.167 line:82%
I am his mother.

1477
02:39:33.792 --> 02:39:37.292 line:82%
He's my son.
Bablu, take the Lord's name!

1478
02:39:37.708 --> 02:39:39.375 line:82%
And pull your mother!

1479
02:40:03.417 --> 02:40:05.125 line:82%
My arm!

1480
02:40:29.208 --> 02:40:30.625 line:82%
You are blind!

1481
02:40:31.708 --> 02:40:33.458 line:82%
This is Manu dada!

1482
02:40:34.958 --> 02:40:37.208 line:82%
My true son is him.

1483
02:40:37.292 --> 02:40:40.000 line:82%
Bablu, I hope you're not hurt.

1484
02:40:41.292 --> 02:40:43.583 line:82%
He couldn't bear his mother's pain.

1485
02:40:44.083 --> 02:40:48.292 line:82%
When I cried in pain,
my child let go of my arm.

1486
02:40:49.583 --> 02:40:51.500 line:82%
This is too much!

1487
02:40:54.208 --> 02:40:57.625 line:82%
If anyone steps forward,
I'll roast the old hag's brains!

1488
02:40:58.625 --> 02:41:02.167 line:82%
-Inspector, throw down your guns!
-Throw down your guns!

1489
02:41:06.417 --> 02:41:08.750 line:82%
-No, son!
-Let my mother go!

1490
02:41:09.333 --> 02:41:13.125 line:82%
-No, Bablu, don't move ahead!
-I'm your enemy, leave my Mom alone.

1491
02:41:13.958 --> 02:41:17.042 line:82%
-Don't come forward, Bablu!
-Don't use women as shields. Let her go!

1492
02:41:17.125 --> 02:41:19.042 line:82%
-Bablu, don't move.
-Fight with me!

1493
02:41:19.125 --> 02:41:20.167 line:82%
-No, Bablu!
-Fight with me!

1494
02:41:20.250 --> 02:41:22.333 line:82%
-Don't move forward.
-Fight with me!

1495
02:41:23.333 --> 02:41:24.417 line:82%
Bablu!

1496
02:41:33.167 --> 02:41:36.667 line:82%
My son! My son!
Are you OK?

1497
02:42:29.250 --> 02:42:31.167 line:82%
Forgive me.

1498
02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:39.625 line:82%
Working with you,
I had become like you.

1499
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:47.292 line:82%
I met Bablu and found out about goodness.

1500
02:42:51.542 --> 02:42:53.875 line:82%
The world needs neither Manu nor Lily.

1501
02:42:54.708 --> 02:42:56.625 line:82%
It needs people like them

1502
02:43:19.375 --> 02:43:21.417 line:82%
When did I imagine this?

1503
02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:23.042 line:82%
When did I know?

1504
02:43:23.333 --> 02:43:25.333 line:82%
That you'd change this much.

1505
02:43:25.417 --> 02:43:27.417 line:82%
That you'd want me this much.

1506
02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:31.458 line:82%
That you'd love me this much
That you'd express it like this

1507
02:43:31.542 --> 02:43:34.458 line:82%
My beloved, my darling

1508
02:43:35.958 --> 02:43:38.833 line:82%
Thank you, it's all your doing
