166
00:20:32.619 --> 00:20:33.733 line:83%
Because something is in it.

167
00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:36.799 line:83%
If we find out what it is,
we'll know what we're up against.

168
00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:57.632 line:83%
HOBBS: All right, listen up! The men
we're after are professional runners.

169
00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:00.409 line:83%
They like speed and are guaranteed
to go down the hardest possible way

170
00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:02.011 line:83%
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

171
00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.972 line:83%
We find them, we take them as a team,
and we bring them back.

172
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:09.644 line:83%
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.

173
00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:12.460 line:83%
Crime scene is 10 hours old
and counting, men. Let's go hunting.

174
00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:18.528 line:83%
Agente Hobbs!
Chief of Police, Joao Alemeida.

175
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.779 line:83%
Luke.

176
00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.444 line:83%
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

177
00:21:22.849 --> 00:21:25.201 line:83%
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

178
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.702 line:83%
Let me tell you something
about these two men.

179
00:21:26.749 --> 00:21:29.372 line:83%
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.

180
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:31.044 line:83%
He knows every way
you're going to come for him.

181
00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:34.502 line:83%
The other one is a professional criminal,
escaped prison twice,

182
00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:37.171 line:83%
spent half his life on the run
avoiding folks like you.

183
00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:40.007 line:83%
Well, if there's anything we can do
to help the DSS...

184
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.176 line:83%
Two things. One, I need a translator.

185
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.678 line:83%
We have plenty
in the public relations department.

186
00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:45.074 line:83%
Elena Neves.

187
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.882 line:83%
-A patrol officer?
-You heard me.

188
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.519 line:83%
But why?
We have many more experienced people.

189
00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:53.035 line:83%
I like her smile.

190
00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:55.142 line:83%
What's the second thing?

191
00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.616 line:83%
Stay the fuck out of my way.

192
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.543 line:83%
(DRILLING)

193
00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:11.455 line:83%
-Brian.
-Hmm?

194
00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.375 line:83%
I have something I have to tell you.

195
00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.127 line:83%
-(DOOR OPENING)
-VINCE: God damn.

196
00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:18.241 line:83%
What a mess!

197
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:21.204 line:83%
Where you been, man?

198
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.092 line:83%
(CHUCKLING)

199
00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:26.095 line:83%
You better check that tone.

200
00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.014 line:83%
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.

201
00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:29.724 line:83%
Stop it! Both of you.

202
00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:34.290 line:83%
Where were you, Vince?

203
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:38.274 line:83%
Guys all over the favelas
asking about you.

204
00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:40.985 line:83%
Couldn't get out of there
without leading them straight to you.

205
00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:42.153 line:83%
Had to wait them out.

206
00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:43.988 line:83%
That is such horseshit.

207
00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:46.115 line:83%
(SHOUTING) That was your job,
and those were your guys!

208
00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:47.873 line:83%
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

209
00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:49.619 line:83%
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.

210
00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:50.974 line:83%
Go walk it off.

211
00:23:05.927 --> 00:23:09.513 line:83%
REYES: Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

212
00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:13.601 line:83%
but, quite frankly,
your business methods are too violent.

213
00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:16.432 line:83%
Let me tell you a true story.

214
00:23:17.069 --> 00:23:21.409 line:83%
Five hundred years ago,
the Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

215
00:23:21.449 --> 00:23:24.987 line:83%
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

216
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.016 line:83%
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

217
00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:37.291 line:83%
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

218
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.297 line:83%
Personally, I prefer the methods
of the Portuguese.

219
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.425 line:83%
They came bearing gifts.

220
00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:48.476 line:83%
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

221
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:52.409 line:83%
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

222
00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:56.644 line:83%
but to continue receiving them,
they had to work for the Portuguese.

223
00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:00.597 line:83%
And that's why
all Brazilians speak Portuguese today.

224
00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:05.339 line:83%
Now, if you dominate the people
with violence,

225
00:24:06.654 --> 00:24:10.074 line:83%
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.

226
00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:12.078 line:83%
And that's the key.

227
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.706 line:83%
I go into the favelas
and give them something to lose.

228
00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:19.542 line:83%
Electricity, running water,

229
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:21.400 line:83%
school rooms for their kids.

230
00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:25.532 line:83%
And for that taste of a better life,

231
00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:28.854 line:83%
I own them.

232
00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:31.929 line:83%
Gentlemen.

233
00:24:33.639 --> 00:24:34.719 line:83%
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

234
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:38.019 line:83%
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
I apologize for the interruption.

235
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:40.855 line:83%
Señor Reyes, may I speak with you?

236
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.627 line:83%
We've found them.

237
00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:46.282 line:83%
Pardon me, gentlemen.

238
00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:04.211 line:83%
DOM: Almost wish I didn't see that.

239
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.716 line:83%
Almost.

240
00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:10.818 line:83%
Wait, Dom.

241
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:13.879 line:83%
Mia was on that train.

242
00:25:13.889 --> 00:25:15.598 line:83%
(SHOUTING) My sister!

243
00:25:16.249 --> 00:25:18.851 line:83%
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

244
00:25:18.893 --> 00:25:20.539 line:83%
You set up the deal!

245
00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:24.206 line:83%
I thought the job was for the cars.

246
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.192 line:83%
I didn't know.

247
00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:27.989 line:83%
All they want is the chip.

248
00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.098 line:83%
Damn!

249
00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:33.741 line:83%
You should've come clean.

250
00:25:33.824 --> 00:25:35.664 line:83%
What's going on out here?

251
00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:37.495 line:83%
Nothing.

252
00:25:37.578 --> 00:25:41.211 line:83%
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip.
I can take this to them.

253
00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:43.544 line:83%
They'll give it to Reyes and
set things right.

254
00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:45.294 line:83%
Get out.

255
00:25:48.469 --> 00:25:49.624 line:83%
What?

256
00:25:50.409 --> 00:25:51.901 line:83%
Get out!

257
00:25:58.933 --> 00:26:00.804 line:83%
You never listen to me.

258
00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:05.314 line:83%
Not when I told you he was a cop,
and not now.

259
00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:10.587 line:83%
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.

260
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:12.446 line:83%
Look at our family now.

261
00:26:12.947 --> 00:26:16.560 line:83%
I can't go home!
Your sister is stuck in this life!

262
00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:19.955 line:83%
Where's Letty, Dom?

263
00:26:22.123 --> 00:26:23.306 line:83%
Where's Letty?

264
00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:48.699 line:83%
Plasma cutter.

265
00:26:49.191 --> 00:26:52.394 line:83%
Wilkes, I want a list of every place
within 50 miles

266
00:26:52.409 --> 00:26:54.321 line:83%
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

267
00:26:54.363 --> 00:26:55.727 line:83%
Pass me that manifest.

268
00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:05.284 line:83%
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

269
00:27:05.349 --> 00:27:07.543 line:83%
-You asked for me?
-I did.

270
00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:09.336 line:83%
May I ask why?

271
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:12.005 line:83%
My smile is not that great.

272
00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:18.053 line:83%
Your husband was an officer who was
gunned down in the favela.

273
00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:20.236 line:83%
Six months later,
you upped and joined the force.

274
00:27:20.329 --> 00:27:21.492 line:83%
You're motivated.

275
00:27:22.183 --> 00:27:24.707 line:83%
Plus, I figure you're the only one in Rio
who can't be bought.

276
00:27:25.139 --> 00:27:26.246 line:83%
Am I right?

277
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.645 line:83%
-Yes.
-Of course I am.

278
00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:31.275 line:83%
Good news, bad news.

279
00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:33.110 line:83%
You know I like my dessert first.

280
00:27:33.139 --> 00:27:35.070 line:83%
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

281
00:27:35.112 --> 00:27:37.457 line:83%
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

282
00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:38.937 line:83%
One set of tracks headed west

283
00:27:38.949 --> 00:27:41.349 line:83%
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

284
00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:43.288 line:83%
But another set of tracks headed east.

285
00:27:43.354 --> 00:27:45.978 line:83%
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

286
00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:48.250 line:83%
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.

287
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.877 line:83%
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

288
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.413 line:83%
Pretty easy in this scrub.

289
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.046 line:83%
Can't move without leaving a sign.

290
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.590 line:83%
Give me the damn veggies.

291
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:58.228 line:83%
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

292
00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:00.804 line:83%
Not necessarily.

293
00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:04.308 line:83%
That road heads up through the hills
into the favelas.

294
00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:06.685 line:83%
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

295
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.188 line:83%
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

296
00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:12.441 line:83%
If they headed that way,
we'll pick up their tracks there.

297
00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:13.849 line:83%
You come prepared.

298
00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:16.278 line:83%
I'm motivated.

299
00:28:17.133 --> 00:28:18.297 line:83%
HOBBS: All right, then.

300
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.081 line:83%
Let's find ourselves a car.

301
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:51.411 line:83%
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

302
00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:52.481 line:83%
What do you think?

303
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.440 line:83%
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

304
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:58.084 line:83%
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

305
00:28:58.737 --> 00:28:59.859 line:83%
Let's check this one.

306
00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:06.745 line:83%
Look at that.

307
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:09.248 line:83%
Same building, same order every week.

308
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:10.942 line:83%
It's a delivery schedule.

309
00:29:32.443 --> 00:29:33.575 line:83%
What's this?

310
00:29:34.731 --> 00:29:35.732 line:83%
Drugs?

311
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:38.735 line:83%
No. That's a dealer pack.

312
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:40.737 line:83%
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

313
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.698 line:83%
so they don't have to constantly count it.

314
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.116 line:83%
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

315
00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:46.595 line:83%
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

316
00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.771 line:83%
You're saying each one of these shipments
is worth 10 million dollars?

317
00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:50.955 line:83%
Yeah.

318
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:53.675 line:83%
(GUN COCKING)

319
00:30:13.449 --> 00:30:14.609 line:83%
I thought so.

320
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:19.401 line:83%
So what is that?

321
00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:22.154 line:83%
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

322
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:24.114 line:83%
