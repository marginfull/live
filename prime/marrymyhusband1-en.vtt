It's a nuisance!

94
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.304 line:80%
Can't they just zap it out?

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.224 line:80%
It'll be fine. We've got technology.

This is my last day as a taxi driver.

165
00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:12.722 line:80%
Take it. Think of it
as an allowance from your dad.

166
00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.350 line:80%
You'll gain energy in no time.

167
00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.936 line:80%
You'll be running around,
making big money.

168
00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:19.979 line:80%
You'll meet someone

169
00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:23.566 line:80%
who would die for you
and have a good life.

170
00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:27.028 line:80%
No, you don't have to do this.

171
00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.123 line:80%
Come on now!

172
00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:40.875 line:80%
You're hurting an old man's arm!

173
00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:56.075 line:80%
But I think you're really smart, babe.

174
00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.370 line:80%
How did you think of cancer insurance?

175
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.251 line:80%
Her dad died of cancer.

176
00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.421 line:80%
She kept getting thinner.

177
00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:11.216 line:80%
I thought it was time,
so I took out a policy.

178
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.849 line:80%
Amazing. You did a good job.

179
00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:26.022 line:80%
Was it a billion won?

180
00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:28.107 line:80%
Yeah, if she dies.

181
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.404 line:80%
I already got the diagnostic insurance
and bought you that designer bag.

182
00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:37.617 line:80%
I put the rest in stocks
to buy you a better bag.

183
00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.953 line:80%
You're so sweet.

184
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.789 line:80%
Let's buy a house when Ji-won dies.

185
00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.374 line:80%
That sounds nice.

186
00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:47.460 line:80%
But this bitch is holding out longer
than I thought.

187
00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:51.256 line:80%
I even didn't tell her to go
to a doctor after I took out the policy.

188
00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.301 line:80%
She's persistent.

189
00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:02.475 line:80%
Maybe I'll take her out for some air
and push her off somewhere.

190
00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.230 line:80%
No. What if you fall too?

191
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.566 line:80%
Why not? I can push her gently.

192
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:11.818 line:80%
No one would know.

193
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:15.363 line:80%
What the hell has she been eating?
Why is she so tenacious?

194
00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.490 line:80%
You should eat whatever she ate.

195
00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.910 line:80%
I don't need to. I'm already strong.

196
00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.050 line:80%
You crazy bastards!

197
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:41.306 line:80%
Ji-won?

198
00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.099 line:80%
Babe, are you okay?

199
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.475 line:80%
Spit it out!

200
00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:52.066 line:80%
-Are you okay, babe?
-I'm okay.

201
00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.987 line:80%
This is insurance fraud.

202
00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.198 line:80%
I'm going to report you.

203
00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.617 line:80%
Hey!

204
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.868 line:80%
What the hell?

205
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:04.662 line:80%
Babe, are you okay?

206
00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:06.205 line:80%
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

207
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.290 line:80%
-Yeah.
-Okay.

208
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.168 line:80%
I won't forgive you if you leave me.

209
00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:12.629 line:80%
Jeong Su-min.

210
00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.437 line:80%
I'm going to kill you both!

211
00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.857 line:80%
I'll kill you both!

212
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:34.359 line:80%
Hey!

213
00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:36.194 line:80%
That's enough.

214
00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:39.113 line:80%
Aren't you sick of this?

215
00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.282 line:80%
Come on.

216
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.493 line:80%
This little...

217
00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.169 line:80%
Hey.

218
00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:57.882 line:80%
What the hell can you do right now?

219
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.512 line:80%
Let's go.

220
00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.055 line:80%
Move out of the way.

221
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.687 line:80%
Hey!

222
00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:21.781 line:80%
Come on!

223
00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:23.199 line:80%
Wait.

224
00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:29.497 line:80%
Ji-won.

225
00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:44.512 line:80%
I'm sorry.

226
00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.310 line:80%
You're sorry?

227
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.146 line:80%
That's enough.

228
00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:01.029 line:80%
We can't do anything about it now.

229
00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:03.281 line:80%
The living should go on living.

230
00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:06.743 line:80%
You're going to die anyway.

231
00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.828 line:80%
You always think only about yourself.

232
00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:25.928 line:80%
This is great.

233
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.479 line:80%
You think you won't die?

234
00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:37.440 line:80%
You don't think it'll happen to you?

235
00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.609 line:80%
-It'll happen to you.
-Stop!

236
00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:41.402 line:80%
-What?
-Stop it!

237
00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:43.488 line:80%
Babe!

238
00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:44.447 line:80%
Hey!

239
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:47.992 line:80%
If you're going to die,
just die already. Get lost!

240
00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:17.814 line:80%
I longed for the happiness I've never had,
yet here I am,

241
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.567 line:80%
with my good old friend, unhappiness.

242
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:34.372 line:80%
Babe.

243
00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:36.749 line:80%
I think she's dead.

244
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.002 line:80%
She was going to die anyway.

245
00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:41.754 line:80%
Does it matter how she dies?

246
00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:42.964 line:80%
What happens to us?

247
00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:44.090 line:80%
Stop talking!

248
00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:47.844 line:80%
People with cancer faint often.

249
00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:49.262 line:80%
She tripped and fell.

250
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:51.889 line:80%
And we found her like this.
We know nothing.

251
00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:54.642 line:80%
What if we don't get paid?

252
00:23:54.725 --> 00:23:55.810 line:80%
-Well?
-What now?

253
00:23:55.893 --> 00:23:58.271 line:80%
I was given six months.

254
00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:00.606 line:80%
Twelve months, if there was a miracle.

255
00:24:01.983 --> 00:24:05.069 line:80%
I didn't even get to live that much.

256
00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:09.073 line:80%
I just died.

257
00:24:09.157 --> 00:24:12.285 line:80%
APRIL 12, 2023

258
00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:29.343 line:80%
Babe, what are you doing?

259
00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:34.932 line:80%
Why are you spacing out?

260
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.520 line:80%
Why aren't you wearing your glasses?

261
00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:56.454 line:80%
Did you go to the hospital?

262
00:24:58.122 --> 00:24:59.207 line:80%
What did they say?

263
00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:13.679 line:80%
Babe, what's wrong? That hurts!

264
00:25:13.763 --> 00:25:15.139 line:80%
That hurts!

265
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:25.858 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

266
00:25:27.318 --> 00:25:28.819 line:80%
Hey!

267
00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:32.365 line:80%
Kang Ji-won, let go! Let go of me!

268
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:33.908 line:80%
Let go of me right now!

269
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:35.326 line:80%
Ji-won, let go!

270
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:36.786 line:80%
God damn it! Let go!

271
00:25:40.498 --> 00:25:41.707 line:80%
Ms. Kang Ji-won!

272
00:25:48.798 --> 00:25:49.924 line:80%
Snap out of it.

273
00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:52.009 line:80%
We're at work. What are you doing?

274
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:55.554 line:80%
Work?

275
00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:14.365 line:80%
Are you okay?

276
00:26:19.954 --> 00:26:20.997 line:80%
What's going on?

277
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.498 line:80%
I don't know.

278
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.003 line:80%
Were you hurt?

279
00:27:10.421 --> 00:27:11.714 line:80%
Just a second.

280
00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:14.633 line:80%
Kang Ji-won.

281
00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:23.267 line:80%
Ji-won!

282
00:27:23.351 --> 00:27:25.269 line:80%
The living should go on living.

283
00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:26.979 line:80%
You're going to die anyway.

284
00:27:28.439 --> 00:27:29.815 line:80%
Get lost!

285
00:27:44.914 --> 00:27:46.415 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won!

286
00:28:19.782 --> 00:28:21.117 line:80%
Stop.

287
00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:32.128 line:80%

00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:03.709 line:80%
2021 51ST ANNUAL U&K SHAREHOLDERS MEETING

328
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:05.335 line:80%
No one knows right now,

329
00:34:05.419 --> 00:34:06.670 line:80%
but our general manager...

330
00:34:08.172 --> 00:34:09.173 line:80%
I will not stop

331
00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:12.551 line:80%
until we become
a global lifestyle company.

332
00:34:12.634 --> 00:34:14.595 line:80%
...is U&K founder Yu Han-il's grandson.

333
00:34:14.678 --> 00:34:16.805 line:80%
That's my vision of U&K.

334
00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.725 line:80%
His succession process will begin
in a few years.

335
00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:29.568 line:80%
The fact that I know this...

336
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:32.029 line:80%
Does it mean I travelled back in time?

337
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.868 line:80%
That's right.

338
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.914 line:80%
Where's the money he gave me?

339
00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:43.415 line:80%
Here it is.

340
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.360 line:80%
Take it. Think of it as an allowance
from your dad.

341
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.575 line:80%
You can't mark on money.

342
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:29.127 line:80%
Dad!

343
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:31.213 line:80%
You can't draw on money like that.

344
00:35:31.922 --> 00:35:33.340 line:80%
Those aren't drawings.

345
00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:35.050 line:80%
It's love.

346
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.803 line:80%
To us, it is love, but you can't do this.

347
00:35:38.387 --> 00:35:40.347 line:80%
Fine. Don't worry.

348
00:35:41.515 --> 00:35:43.225 line:80%
I should listen to you.

349
00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:44.977 line:80%
I'll do everything you want.

350
00:35:48.188 --> 00:35:49.481 line:80%
I can't believe you.

351
00:36:12.504 --> 00:36:14.089 line:80%
It's from Dad.

352
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.133 line:80%
NAME: CHOI NAM-HYEON

353
00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:17.843 line:80%
NAME: KANG HYEON-MO

354
00:36:26.018 --> 00:36:27.102 line:80%
I'll do it all.

355
00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:28.812 line:80%
I'll do everything for you!

356
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:37.404 line:80%
Dad...

357
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.368 line:80%
You should have told me it was you.

358
00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:27.788 line:80%
Why is your face so bloated?

359
00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:33.543 line:80%
Come out. Let's go eat.

360
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.137 line:80%
Ji-won, what's going on?

361
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:46.890 line:80%
You haven't been picking up
since you ran out.

362
00:37:46.974 --> 00:37:48.767 line:80%
I'm worried about you.

363
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.560 line:80%
I'm coming over right now.

364
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.896 line:80%
I'm not feeling well.

365
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.148 line:80%
Don't come. I'm with Min-hwan.

366
00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:02.656 line:80%
Oh, my.

367
00:38:10.372 --> 00:38:11.581 line:80%
Hey.

368
00:38:14.084 --> 00:38:15.335 line:80%
You're so immature.

369
00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:19.631 line:80%
Yeah, I know you have a lot on your mind.
That's okay.

370
00:38:20.549 --> 00:38:22.467 line:80%
I don't understand,

371
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:24.636 line:80%
but women say it happens, so, fine.

372
00:38:25.387 --> 00:38:26.763 line:80%
I get it.

373
00:38:26.847 --> 00:38:28.974 line:80%
But you're making it too obvious at work.

374
00:38:29.433 --> 00:38:30.642 line:80%
Isn't that wrong?

375
00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:34.229 line:80%
What good can come
from making things bad for me?

376
00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:38.025 line:80%
Speak so I can understand.

377
00:38:46.616 --> 00:38:47.743 line:80%
When did it happen?

378
00:38:48.744 --> 00:38:51.121 line:80%
We haven't done it in a while.

379
00:38:51.204 --> 00:38:52.456 line:80%
Why are you pregnant?

380
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:56.626 line:80%
Are you sure it's mine?

381
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.130 line:80%
What?

382
00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:02.007 line:80%
You told me you think you're pregnant.

383
00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:05.135 line:80%
I remember.

384
00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:08.930 line:80%
I couldn't stomach anything,
so I thought I was pregnant.

385
00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:11.349 line:80%
It was gastritis from stress.

386
00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:13.185 line:80%
Was this the start?

387
00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:16.855 line:80%
It wasn't enough
he stressed me out until I died,

388
00:39:16.938 --> 00:39:18.857 line:80%
he had an affair with my friend.

389
00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:23.528 line:80%
I was just kidding.

390
00:39:24.154 --> 00:39:26.990 line:80%
It's not like you could do that
with another man.

391
00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:30.243 line:80%
Don't take this the wrong way.

392
00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:33.663 line:80%
I'm just saying that you're not young.

393
00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:37.334 line:80%
If you step back now,
you can't work again.

394
00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:39.753 line:80%
That's a huge career break.

395
00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:41.379 line:80%
You love work.

396
00:39:41.463 --> 00:39:44.466 line:80%
You don't want to become
some old stay-at-home lady.

397
00:39:44.549 --> 00:39:45.759 line:80%
Having a baby now

398
00:39:46.218 --> 00:39:49.387 line:80%
is like clipping the wings
off of a free bird.

399
00:39:50.138 --> 00:39:53.975 line:80%
If I hadn't known you'd sponge off of me
after quitting your job,

400
00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:55.852 line:80%
your words would be plausible.

401
00:39:57.062 --> 00:39:58.105 line:80%
Get an abortion.

402
00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:00.732 line:80%
As for the fee...

403
00:40:02.484 --> 00:40:03.485 line:80%
Fine.

404
00:40:04.694 --> 00:40:05.904 line:80%
I'll pay for half.

405
00:40:07.197 --> 00:40:09.533 line:80%
-Half?
-If you're going to do it anyway,

406
00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.868 line:80%
do it quickly for your body.

407
00:40:11.952 --> 00:40:13.370 line:80%
Also, I don't want kids.

408
00:40:14.204 --> 00:40:15.997 line:80%
Nothing good can come from it.

409
00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:19.835 line:80%
Min-hwan's the third generation
of families with only sons.

410
00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:21.920 line:80%
How dare you sever that?

411
00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:34.766 line:80%
I'm not pregnant.

412
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.061 line:80%
It's gastritis.

413
00:40:42.858 --> 00:40:44.276 line:80%
You're not pregnant?

414
00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:48.238 line:80%
It's gastritis? I see.

415
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:54.452 line:80%
Then why are you so sensitive?

416
00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.624 line:80%
Let's break up.

417
00:41:00.292 --> 00:41:02.335 line:80%
-What?
-Are you done talking?

418
00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.681 line:80%
Are you done talking?

419
00:41:15.807 --> 00:41:19.477 line:80%
I tried to be understanding
when you were acting crazy today.

420
00:41:19.561 --> 00:41:21.062 line:80%
And you want to break up?

421
00:41:21.146 --> 00:41:22.189 line:80%
Let go of me!

422
00:41:22.272 --> 00:41:23.565 line:80%
You little...

423
00:41:25.817 --> 00:41:28.028 line:80%
Did I say something wrong?

424
00:41:28.153 --> 00:41:29.863 line:80%
Why are you being hysterical?

425
00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:31.448 line:80%
-I forgot.
-Are
you crazy?

426
00:41:31.573 --> 00:41:32.866 line:80%
Park Min-hwan

427
00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:34.326 line:80%
doesn't care if I die.

428
00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:36.870 line:80%
But can't stand the idea of breaking up.

429
00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:39.998 line:80%
Let go of me and talk!

430
00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:42.834 line:80%
Who do you think you are
to break up with me?

431
00:41:42.918 --> 00:41:44.252 line:80%
I'm going to kill you.

432
00:41:44.711 --> 00:41:47.005 line:80%
Tell me. What is it?

433
00:41:51.092 --> 00:41:51.968 line:80%
Tell me.

434
00:41:52.052 --> 00:41:54.304 line:80%
Do you think you can break up with me?

435
00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:55.764 line:80%
How dare you say that.

436
00:41:56.431 --> 00:41:57.474 line:80%
Tell me. Why?

437
00:41:57.557 --> 00:41:59.559 line:80%
Tell me.

438
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:03.647 line:80%
Is anyone there? Someone, help me!

439
00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:10.737 line:80%
Help!

440
00:42:11.821 --> 00:42:13.531 line:80%
Please help me!

441
00:42:15.617 --> 00:42:16.534 line:80%
Miss?

442
00:42:16.618 --> 00:42:20.121 line:80%
You can't come to the police station
over a lover's quarrel.

443
00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:22.374 line:80%
It's not like that. He almost...

444
00:42:22.457 --> 00:42:23.708 line:80%
I know. I get it.

445
00:42:24.417 --> 00:42:26.044 line:80%
But eight out of ten women

446
00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:28.588 line:80%
ask us why we're doing this to their men.

447
00:42:28.672 --> 00:42:30.465 line:80%
How ridiculous is that for us?

448
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:31.383 line:80%
You know, sir.

449
00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:34.594 line:80%
There are days
when women are sensitive for no reason.

450
00:42:35.178 --> 00:42:36.888 line:80%
I'll apologize on her behalf.

451
00:42:37.222 --> 00:42:39.474 line:80%
You weren't hit, and nothing's broken.

452
00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:42.394 line:80%
I see your boyfriend works
for a big company.

453
00:42:42.936 --> 00:42:47.065 line:80%
You can't come to the police
just because you got angry and sensitive--

454
00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:47.983 line:80%
Excuse me.

455
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:51.361 line:80%
Do I have to come here
after something's broken?

456
00:42:52.696 --> 00:42:54.114 line:80%
Forget it.

457
00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:56.157 line:80%
Can you at least take me home?

458
00:43:07.711 --> 00:43:09.045 line:80%
It can't be like this.

459
00:43:15.135 --> 00:43:16.553 line:80%
BALANCE: 718,916 WON

460
00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:19.097 line:80%
What am I supposed to do?

461
00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.266 line:80%
BALANCE: 718,916 WON
RECIPIENT: PARK MIN-HWAN

462
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:23.560 line:80%
At this time, I was scared to break up.

463
00:43:23.643 --> 00:43:25.395 line:80%
So I did whatever he wanted.

464
00:43:25.478 --> 00:43:28.023 line:80%
He already has a lot of my money.

465
00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:30.275 line:80%
He's used my card and cash loans.

466
00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:32.902 line:80%
What do I do?

467
00:43:32.986 --> 00:43:34.112 line:80%
I can't see a way.

468
00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:36.281 line:80%
I already settled my severance pay.

469
00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:39.034 line:80%
I can't run away with 700,000 won.

470
00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:40.368 line:80%
I won't last a month.

471
00:43:43.038 --> 00:43:45.165 line:80%
I'm sorry I got mad and yelled.

472
00:43:45.248 --> 00:43:47.542 line:80%
-But you're at fault too.
-What the hell?

473
00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:49.336 line:80%
I meant what I said earlier.

474
00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:51.087 line:80%
I was going to buy you a bag

475
00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:53.006 line:80%
once the stocks do well.

476
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:55.300 line:80%
I got inside information on Roijental.

477
00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:57.177 line:80%
He's crazy.

478
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.554 line:80%
Let's get married after this.

479
00:44:06.353 --> 00:44:09.147 line:80%
I'm going into stocks.
Do you remember Roijental?

480
00:44:09.314 --> 00:44:10.315 line:80%
Roijental?

481
00:44:12.734 --> 00:44:13.610 line:80%
Roijental?

482
00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:15.362 line:80%
Why didn't I think of that?

483
00:44:17.614 --> 00:44:18.656 line:80%
Roijental!

484
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.867 line:80%
The only success in Min-hwan's life.

485
00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:23.244 line:80%
I see a way now.

486
00:44:24.704 --> 00:44:27.248 line:80%
I'll use this to get through this for now.

487
00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:29.459 line:80%
I don't remember everything

488
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:30.960 line:80%
that happened since 2013,

489
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.634 line:80%
but I know what was successful.

490
00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:38.843 line:80%
I can do this.

491
00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.390 line:80%
I'm going to live a proper life this time.
For real.

492
00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:56.653 line:80%
I told you.

493
00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:59.239 line:80%
You didn't have to do the scan.

494
00:44:59.322 --> 00:45:00.657 line:80%
It's just gastritis.

495
00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.992 line:80%
It's serious, so take your meds.

496
00:45:03.076 --> 00:45:04.285 line:80%
Don't be stressed.

497
00:45:06.037 --> 00:45:07.205 line:80%
Yes, sir.

498
00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.881 line:80%
Okay.

499
00:45:17.465 --> 00:45:19.467 line:80%
I just need to maintain my health.

When you said a
gukbap
restaurant,

516
00:46:49.057 --> 00:46:52.227 line:80%
I didn't think it'd look like this.

517
00:46:53.061 --> 00:46:54.187 line:80%
Are there others?

518
00:46:57.148 --> 00:46:58.775 line:80%
No.

519
00:46:58.858 --> 00:47:01.861 line:80%
I never spoke with him before,
so I didn't know.

520
00:47:01.945 --> 00:47:04.489 line:80%
He's very...

521
00:47:04.572 --> 00:47:05.698 line:80%
Thank you.

522
00:47:06.533 --> 00:47:08.743 line:80%
You can tell he's super classy.

523
00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:11.704 line:80%
Let's eat.

524
00:47:25.218 --> 00:47:26.177 line:80%
How is it?

525
00:47:31.641 --> 00:47:33.685 line:80%
A lot better than I thought.

526
00:47:36.104 --> 00:47:37.855 line:80%
You haven't tried it yet.

527
00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:39.482 line:80%
What are you referring to?

528
00:47:43.444 --> 00:47:45.905 line:80%
I meant the food.

529
00:47:49.951 --> 00:47:51.411 line:80%
Thank you.

530
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:57.584 line:80%
Was he always like this?

531
00:47:58.126 --> 00:48:01.546 line:80%
He's more handsome and considerate
than I remember. Also...

532
00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:05.008 line:80%
Did you go to the hospital?

533
00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:07.176 line:80%
Yeah, I just did.

534
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.178 line:80%
Then I stopped by the bookstore.

535
00:48:12.015 --> 00:48:13.600 line:80%
Thank you for yesterday.

536
00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:16.978 line:80%
You took me home,

537
00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:19.606 line:80%
and bought me
the cup noodle and chamomile--

538
00:48:19.689 --> 00:48:21.441 line:80%
You're different today.

539
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:24.444 line:80%
I am?

540
00:48:25.028 --> 00:48:26.738 line:80%
Are you really going to quit?

541
00:48:29.616 --> 00:48:31.367 line:80%
I was considering it.

542
00:48:32.827 --> 00:48:34.746 line:80%
I can't keep going like this.

543
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:39.667 line:80%
I figured it was time for a change.

544
00:48:41.419 --> 00:48:43.087 line:80%
-Marriage?
-What?

545
00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:46.674 line:80%
You bought a book about interior.
I just assumed.

546
00:48:46.758 --> 00:48:48.092 line:80%
MASTER INTERIOR DESIGN

547
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.761 line:80%
No, that's not...

548
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.890 line:80%
True, I was preparing
to marry Park Min-hwan this year.

549
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.479 line:80%
I do have to think about marriage.

550
00:48:59.562 --> 00:49:02.023 line:80%
In that I'd rather die than do it.

551
00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:11.199 line:80%
Actually...

552
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:16.954 line:80%
OTHER HALF

553
00:49:36.391 --> 00:49:37.850 line:80%
It's okay.

554
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:44.107 line:80%
Ji-won, call me right back, over.

555
00:49:47.527 --> 00:49:50.029 line:80%
Why won't she pick up?

556
00:49:50.113 --> 00:49:52.323 line:80%
She caused a scene at work yesterday.

557
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:04.544 line:80%
You're my only friend, Ji-won.

558
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:11.926 line:80%
Where the hell is she?
Why won't she answer?

559
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:25.314 line:80%
It's the same scar.

560
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.074 line:80%
I'm so sorry!

561
00:50:36.826 --> 00:50:38.870 line:80%
The scar looks bad.

562
00:50:41.622 --> 00:50:42.623 line:80%
It's fine.

563
00:50:46.544 --> 00:50:47.712 line:80%
Let's go.

564
00:50:48.463 --> 00:50:49.756 line:80%
Okay.

565
00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:55.887 line:80%
Thanks for the meal.

566
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:57.138 line:80%
That makes us even.

567
00:50:57.722 --> 00:50:58.931 line:80%
One meal was enough.

568
00:51:00.683 --> 00:51:01.809 line:80%
Okay.

569
00:51:03.811 --> 00:51:04.979 line:80%
Also...

570
00:51:08.524 --> 00:51:10.526 line:80%
You are a very talented person.

571
00:51:11.194 --> 00:51:13.863 line:80%
Getting married
and starting a family is nice,

572
00:51:13.946 --> 00:51:15.823 line:80%
but I think it'd be a shame if you quit.

573
00:51:18.451 --> 00:51:19.452 line:80%
As your boss.

574
00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:28.336 line:80%
Thank you.

575
00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:32.465 line:80%
Now, if you'll excuse me.

576
00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:34.634 line:80%
Okay. Bye.

580

I was scared of him
because he was always frowning.

581
00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:21.222 line:80%
But he's a pretty decent person.

582
00:52:22.807 --> 00:52:25.852 line:80%
How did he know I was talented?

583
00:52:28.604 --> 00:52:29.730 line:80%
I had forgotten

584
00:52:31.858 --> 00:52:34.151 line:80%
that I was good at my job.

585
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:37.071 line:80%
I wanted to do a lot of things at work.

Things I had to give up

What's her deal?

591
00:53:01.304 --> 00:53:02.930 line:80%
She's pissing me off again.

592
00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:19.864 line:80%
Why do I have to go through this
because of Min-hwan?

593
00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:35.212 line:80%
Get to work, everyone!

594
00:53:35.296 --> 00:53:38.299 line:80%

Last night?

609
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.278 line:80%
You know MODU Community.

610
00:54:42.321 --> 00:54:45.032 line:80%
I was browsing
the Marriage, In-laws & Family Board,

611
00:54:45.116 --> 00:54:46.367 line:80%
and I lost track of time.

612
00:54:48.077 --> 00:54:49.578 line:80%
I see.

613
00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:54.792 line:80%
There's this woman
who has late stage cancer.

614
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:58.963 line:80%
She saw her husband and her friend in bed.

615
00:55:00.715 --> 00:55:03.050 line:80%
Really? That's crazy.

616
00:55:04.427 --> 00:55:05.428 line:80%
It is, isn't it?

617
00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:10.307 line:80%
Wow, that friend is worse
than the husband. So gross.

618
00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:12.810 line:80%
How could she do that to her best friend?

619
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:14.562 line:80%
I know.

620
00:55:17.273 --> 00:55:20.401 line:80%
She's going to die anyway,
so she probably thought it was okay.

621
00:55:26.365 --> 00:55:29.660 line:80%
You can have everything I own if I die.

622
00:55:30.161 --> 00:55:31.787 line:80%
But if you die, I will too.

623
00:55:37.168 --> 00:55:38.961 line:80%
-Kang Ji-won.
-Yes?

624
00:55:50.473 --> 00:55:52.266 line:80%
When will you get your touch back?

625
00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:57.021 line:80%
You don't like my proposal?
Is it that bad?

626
00:55:57.688 --> 00:55:59.440 line:80%
"Bad"?

627
00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:02.568 line:80%
That would be saying it nicely.
This just sucks.

628
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:04.361 line:80%
It sucks!

00:56:15.498 --> 00:56:16.957 line:80%
However,

632
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:21.128 line:80%
Su-min proposed it without changing
a single word and he proceeded it.

633
00:56:21.212 --> 00:56:22.213 line:80%
Ji-won.

634
00:56:23.214 --> 00:56:25.800 line:80%
This is great!

635
00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:29.053 line:80%
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

636
00:56:29.136 --> 00:56:33.349 line:80%
She became a full-time employee with this
and got promoted.

637
00:56:33.849 --> 00:56:35.851 line:80%
Does this make sense to you?

638
00:56:35.935 --> 00:56:37.561 line:80%

639
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.897 line:80%
Why would someone living alone cook?

640
00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.942 line:80%
"Add water to a pot and boil it"?
How bothersome.

641
00:56:43.526 --> 00:56:46.028 line:80%

Jeez, freeze-dried squid?

643
00:56:48.072 --> 00:56:51.492 line:80%
Opening all these packages
will take a whole day!

644
00:56:51.659 --> 00:56:53.327 line:80%
Does this make sense to you?

645
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.831 line:80%
The development team will say,
"Do it yourself if you can!"

646
00:56:58.207 --> 00:57:00.459 line:80%
-What do I do?
-Manager Kim Gyeong-uk.

647
00:57:00.543 --> 00:57:02.878 line:80%
He's rude and incompetent.

648
00:57:02.962 --> 00:57:04.547 line:80%
He's an opportunist.

649
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:06.132 line:80%
Who was it again?

650
00:57:06.215 --> 00:57:08.926 line:80%
He has relations with a famous higher-up.

651
00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:10.219 line:80%
Who am I talking to?

652
00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:12.847 line:80%
Ms. Kang?

653
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:14.598 line:80%
What are you thinking about?

654
00:57:16.183 --> 00:57:19.270 line:80%
If you tell me what it lacks,
I'll edit it.

655
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:23.065 line:80%
This is the problem with women.
They're so dependent!

656
00:57:23.149 --> 00:57:25.484 line:80%
You need to figure it out yourself.

657
00:57:25.568 --> 00:57:29.071 line:80%
Also, try to be considerate of others
when you come to work.

658
00:57:29.321 --> 00:57:31.448 line:80%
Why are you dressed like that?

659
00:57:32.116 --> 00:57:34.702 line:80%
Ms. Yang's like that because she's married

660
00:57:34.785 --> 00:57:36.036 line:80%
but you're not.

661
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.664 line:80%
How are the men supposed to take it?

662
00:57:38.747 --> 00:57:41.709 line:80%
This is because
women don't do military service.

663
00:57:41.792 --> 00:57:45.337 line:80%
Our country should make women serve too.

664
00:57:45.421 --> 00:57:46.881 line:80%
Right, Mr. Park?

665
00:57:47.256 --> 00:57:48.799 line:80%
Yes, I'll proceed with it.

666
00:57:49.216 --> 00:57:50.384 line:80%
Right?

667
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:52.303 line:80%
Fix this and bring it back.

668
00:58:17.036 --> 00:58:20.581 line:80%
She's Kim Gyeong-uk's right-hand person,
so we barely spoke.

669
00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:22.958 line:80%
But she's a good employee.

670
00:58:23.042 --> 00:58:26.795 line:80%
Mr. Kim prevented her promotion
until she quit the company,

671
00:58:26.879 --> 00:58:30.090 line:80%
but she deserved to be a manager.

672
00:58:32.301 --> 00:58:33.886 line:80%
-Excuse me--
-Ms. Yang.

673
00:58:35.095 --> 00:58:36.680 line:80%
Mr. Kim's looking for you.

674
00:59:20.891 --> 00:59:22.017 line:80%
This is nice!

675
00:59:27.356 --> 00:59:28.857 line:80%
-Let's talk.
-No.

676
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:29.942 line:80%
But, I...

677
00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:32.444 line:80%
Damn it.

678
00:59:42.454 --> 00:59:43.831 line:80%
Goodness!

679
00:59:44.623 --> 00:59:46.250 line:80%
Be careful.

680
00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:48.836 line:80%
Are you okay? You suddenly jumped out!

681
00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:51.130 line:80%
What was that? Something just...

682
00:59:51.213 --> 00:59:52.965 line:80%
No, I'm fine. I'm so sorry.

683
00:59:53.048 --> 00:59:54.550 line:80%
I'm sorry.

684
01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:10.357 line:80%
It felt the same. I'm sure of it.

685
01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:14.403 line:80%
It was the same spot too.

686
01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:18.032 line:80%
No.

687
01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.492 line:80%
That's not possible. What am I thinking?

688
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:24.872 line:80%
Hey.

689
01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.082 line:80%
Hey!

690
01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.752 line:80%
Hey, Ji-won! Hey!

691
01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:31.879 line:80%
Kang Ji-won!

692
01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:36.550 line:80%
Are you okay?

693
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.312 line:80%
Eventually, I got hurt.

694
01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.606 line:80%
In the same exact spot.

695
01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.235 line:80%
I avoided it, but I couldn't avoid it.

696
01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:02.117 line:80%
Wait, does that mean...

697
01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:09.917 line:80%
No.

698
01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:14.129 line:80%
But my injury is gone.

699
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:18.592 line:80%
I once burned myself
because I was so anxious

700
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.637 line:80%
I might've been pregnant
and spilled some hot water.

701
01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:25.140 line:80%
What does this mean?
I'm missing something.

702
01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:45.494 line:80%
ASSISTANT MANAGER PARK MIN-HWAN
IMAGE SENT

703
01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:58.298 line:80%
SELL

704
01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.467 line:80%
PARK MIN-HWAN
ROIJENTAL

705
01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.307 line:80%
ROIJENTAL
PREVIOUS SALE: 81,415

706
01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:09.017 line:80%
You sold Roijental?

707
01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:10.519 line:80%
Let's talk.

708
01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.563 line:80%
Are you ignoring me?

709
01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.440 line:80%
You're being so rude!

710
01:02:15.983 --> 01:02:19.319 line:80%
Hey. I sold my stocks.

711
01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:20.988 line:80%
To pay you back.

712
01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.614 line:80%
I deposited it. Check it.

713
01:02:22.698 --> 01:02:24.741 line:80%
If TKU Technology does well,

714
01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:27.244 line:80%
it'll be huge, so I don't regret this.

715
01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:30.080 line:80%
Just remember
I sold incredible stocks for you.

716
01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:33.000 line:80%
That's who you are to me.

717
01:02:33.584 --> 01:02:35.419 line:80%
TKU Technology?

718
01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:39.214 line:80%
The ruling and opposing lawmakers
involved in the TKU list...

719
01:02:39.298 --> 01:02:42.593 line:80%
I know nothing about stocks,
but I know about TKU.

720
01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.470 line:80%
It was a famous Pump and Dump.

721
01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:47.014 line:80%
The CEO ends up running off abroad

722
01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.765 line:80%
and the stock gets delisted.

723
01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:50.642 line:80%
He sold Roijental,

724
01:02:50.726 --> 01:02:52.436 line:80%
and bought TKU?

725
01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:55.063 line:80%
I bought Roijental.

726
01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:56.857 line:80%
And Park Min-hwan sold it.

727
01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.568 line:80%
Let's start the meeting for Team One.

728
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.030 line:80%
Bring the survey data for the new product.

729
01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.615 line:80%
Yes, sir.

730
01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.301 line:80%
Wow, it went up again.

731
01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:26.470 line:80%
Hey. I sold my stocks.

732
01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.440 line:80%
What's bound to happen will happen.

733
01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:48.408 line:80%
How's your injury?

734
01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:54.831 line:80%
It just needs to happen to somebody.

735
01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:56.583 line:80%
You're always getting hurt.

736
01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:58.919 line:80%
I thought I was having a heart attack.

737
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.838 line:80%
Are you listening to me?

738
01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:11.056 line:80%
Su-min.

739
01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.520 line:80%
I have some trash to throw away.

740
01:04:17.396 --> 01:04:18.730 line:80%
Will you do it for me?

741
01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.567 line:80%
What are you talking about?

742
01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:24.486 line:80%
Please.

743
01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:27.030 line:80%
You're my other half.

744
01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:31.535 line:80%
Okay.

745
01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.996 line:80%
In return, let's hang out this weekend.

746
01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:39.751 line:80%
I found a yummy BBQ restaurant.
It's called Goseuljung.

747
01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.178 line:80%
Yeah, let's do it.

748
01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.102 line:80%
As long as you throw out my trash.

749
01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:00.564 line:80%
Okay.

750
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.653 line:80%
Assistant Manager Kang and Ms. Jeong.
Hurry up.

751
01:05:07.154 --> 01:05:08.155 line:80%
Coming.

752
01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:26.798 line:80%
You've been coveting my trash.

753
01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:35.932 line:80%
You take it out.

754
01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:44.316 line:80%
Marry my husband.

755
01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:03.168 line:80%
I need someone to steal my fate.

756
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:06.463 line:80%
If anyone, it has to be you.

757
01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.298 line:80%
Ji-won, this is no fun.

758
01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:09.341 line:80%
I hate it.

759
01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:11.134 line:80%
If things didn't go your way,

760
01:06:11.218 --> 01:06:13.470 line:80%
you'd behave perversely. I knew that.

761
01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.263 line:80%
Mr. Park, you're a competent man.

762
01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.974 line:80%
What perfume do you use?

763
01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:18.934 line:80%
You're dead today.

764
01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.936 line:80%
That passionate love of yours...

765
01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.479 line:80%
I'll help make it come true.

766
01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.272 line:80%
Do you have plans this weekend?

767
01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:25.607 line:80%
You come first, Ms. Kang.

768
01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:27.442 line:80%
Just remember that you owe me.

769
01:06:27.526 --> 01:06:31.071 line:80%
Did you dump me for Yu Ji-hyuk?
That crazy old fart.

770
01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.448 line:80%
I won't just take it anymore.

771
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.082 line:80%
