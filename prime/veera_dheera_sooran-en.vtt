00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.800 line:82%
Brother, we've already sent the load
the other day like you said.

2
00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.759 line:82%
Yes, brother.

3
00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:31.925 line:82%
You haven't paid me yet.

4
00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.759 line:82%
Watch your head!

5
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.259 line:82%
Don't bother with this, brother.
Give it to me.

6
00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:43.675 line:82%
Go and rest.
Leave it to me.

7
00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:45.134 line:82%
Come on!
Give it to me.

8
00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:47.009 line:82%
Listen to me.
Take a breather.

9
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.509 line:82%
You just won't listen to me!

10
00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:50.300 line:82%
Kids, it's slippery.
Be careful!

11
00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:51.342 line:82%
Where is my husband?

12
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.342 line:82%
Where the hell is my husband?

13
00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.175 line:82%
What is this, a police station?

14
00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:01.592 line:82%
If anything happens to my husband,

15
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.509 line:82%
I won’t let anyone get away with it.

16
00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:07.592 line:82%
Don’t start a fuss on
this special occasion.

17
00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:11.259 line:82%
Careful on the stairs!
It's slippery.

18
00:02:11.342 --> 00:02:12.675 line:82%
I’m staying right here
until I see him.

19
00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:17.884 line:82%
You want to be the only one
doing business here, huh?

20
00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:19.634 line:82%
Don’t we deserve to do
anything around here?

21
00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:21.509 line:82%
You won’t let us
get ahead in life, will you?

22
00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.800 line:82%
How are you okay
with making money like this?

23
00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:28.717 line:82%
You're going to regret this.

24
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.467 line:82%
Nothing, brother.

25
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:35.800 line:82%
My husband…

26
00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:37.717 line:82%
Here, take this.

27
00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:39.259 line:82%
-It's alright, you go ahead.
-Uncle?

28
00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:40.634 line:82%
-What did you do to him?
-Serve him first.

29
00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:42.009 line:82%
-He's hungry.
-You want a bigger piece?

30
00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:43.467 line:82%
-Wait, let me serve you.
-You're in deep trouble!

31
00:02:43.884 --> 00:02:45.259 line:82%
Which grade are you in?

32
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:46.550 line:82%
Third grade.

33
00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:50.287 line:82%
Didn’t you say you’d go to the cops?

34
00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.620 line:82%
Why haven’t you left yet?

35
00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:54.329 line:82%
You're this full of yourself
because you think you own it all?

36
00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:55.662 line:82%
What’s the commotion here?

37
00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:58.620 line:82%
What's going on here?
Get inside, everyone!

38
00:02:58.787 --> 00:02:59.620 line:82%
Go inside.

39
00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:02.412 line:82%
-Why are you putting on a show?
-Sreeja…

40
00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:04.620 line:82%
-Sreeja, go inside!
-Get up. Get up, I say!

41
00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.412 line:82%
-Get the hell out!
-Take your hands off!

42
00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:08.329 line:82%
-Dear, please listen to me.
-Get out!

43
00:03:08.537 --> 00:03:09.870 line:82%
-Will you come inside or not?
-Leave!

44
00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.829 line:82%
-Why are you stooping to her level?
-Tell her, Mom.

45
00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:14.162 line:82%
He left this morning
and still hasn’t come back.

46
00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:15.829 line:82%
-Go home, lady!
-Get up, I say!

47
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.870 line:82%
You all had a hand in this,
and now you’re acting all innocent?

48
00:03:17.912 --> 00:03:20.662 line:82%
-Lodge a complaint if he is missing.
-Let go of me, I say!

49
00:03:20.704 --> 00:03:22.162 line:82%
-Sreeja! Come inside.
-Get out of here!

50
00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.079 line:82%
-Where the hell is my husband?
-Hey!

51
00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.537 line:82%
I'm already bloody pissed
with you all!

52
00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.579 line:82%
-Better leave.
-What will you do?

53
00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:31.537 line:82%
-Kannan, listen. Stop talking, you!
-Even a minor scratch on him…

54
00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:33.704 line:82%
I’ll shred you all to pieces!

55
00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.537 line:82%
-Such nerve of you to threaten us!
-I swear! Without any mercy!

56
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.995 line:82%
-Sreeja, get inside.
-If my husband doesn’t return…

57
00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.662 line:82%
you’re all doomed!

58
00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:44.829 line:82%
How dare you walk into our house
and curse us on a holy day?

59
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.954 line:82%
-Hands off, you filthy dog!
-Get lost!

60
00:03:47.037 --> 00:03:49.037 line:82%
-Let go of her.
-Didn't I ask you to leave?

61
00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.162 line:82%
Go. I said get inside.

62
00:03:52.187 --> 00:03:54.329 line:82%
She is talking to my brother
with such disrespect?

63
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.454 line:82%
And you are being calm?

64
00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:57.620 line:82%
Go!

65
00:03:57.645 --> 00:03:58.704 line:82%
I’m off to the SP’s office.

66
00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:02.079 line:82%
I'll meet with the collector.

67
00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:04.829 line:82%
-None of you will get away with this!
-Get lost, you!

68
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:06.287 line:82%
Go ahead, meet whoever you want!

69
00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.245 line:82%
What, son?

70
00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.287 line:82%
She said she’s off to the SP’s office?

71
00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:12.662 line:82%
We have nothing to
do with that, right?

72
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.745 line:82%
No, Dad.

73
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.704 line:82%
If we were, don’t you think
I’d have told you earlier?

74
00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:19.120 line:82%
How dare that wretched woman
disrespect my brother?

75
00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:20.162 line:82%
Forget it.

76
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.037 line:82%
Wash your hands.
Let's eat.

77
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.662 line:82%
-Take care of that issue.
-Okay, Uncle.

78
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.329 line:82%
-Mom, I dropped my chicken.
-Keep quiet!

79
00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:30.495 line:82%
I’m losing my mind not knowing
if your father is alive,

80
00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:33.120 line:82%
and you want to eat chicken?

81
00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:34.495 line:82%
What are you doing?

82
00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:37.495 line:82%
You brat!
Will you do that again?

83
00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:41.829 line:82%
Mom, I don't want chicken.
I don't want chicken.

84
00:04:44.037 --> 00:04:45.204 line:82%
I don't want it.

85
00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:47.704 line:82%
I don't want chicken, Mom.

86
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.329 line:82%
I don't want chicken, Mom.

87
00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:50.954 line:82%
I don't want it anymore, Mom.

88
00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:04.912 line:82%
Mom, I'm scared!

89
00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:06.329 line:82%
Mom?

90
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.704 line:82%
Mom?

91
00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:11.245 line:82%
Mom?

92
00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:32.912 line:82%
Shankar!

93
00:05:33.787 --> 00:05:35.495 line:82%
Sir. Sir.
My name is Shankar.

94
00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:36.620 line:82%
Sir, my…

95
00:05:36.662 --> 00:05:38.412 line:82%
-Sir, I need to speak to the inspector.
-Go to the writer.

96
00:05:38.787 --> 00:05:41.454 line:82%
-I run a chicken business in Melur.
-Go inside.

97
00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:43.829 line:82%
-Sir, where?
-Go inside.

98
00:05:43.912 --> 00:05:45.287 line:82%
Big congrats to him!

99
00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:46.662 line:82%
If you handed it over,
it should be here.

100
00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:48.662 line:82%
-How can it just vanish?
-Check once, ma'am.

101
00:05:49.037 --> 00:05:50.579 line:82%
Ma'am, my name is Shankar.

102
00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:51.912 line:82%
In Melur bazaar…

103
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.912 line:82%
Ma'am, my wife and child are missing.

104
00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.662 line:82%
-My daughter is eight years old.
-How long have they been missing?

105
00:05:56.995 --> 00:05:58.329 line:82%
About an hour and a half, ma'am.

106
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.038 line:82%
Don’t you have
even a shred of conscience?

107
00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:04.787 line:82%
She’s already filed a report
here saying I went missing.

108
00:06:05.287 --> 00:06:07.162 line:82%
I came with her.
Around 4 in the evening.

109
00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:09.079 line:82%
I need to see the Inspector.

110
00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:11.745 line:82%
Inspector is handling
security at the temple.

111
00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:12.787 line:82%
He'll be late.

112
00:06:12.954 --> 00:06:15.370 line:82%
Wait for a couple of hours.
They'll come home.

113
00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:16.495 line:82%
Ma'am?

114
00:06:16.537 --> 00:06:18.079 line:82%
Ma'am, she went to Periyavar's
house searching for me.

115
00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:19.620 line:82%
Something happened over there.

116
00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:21.162 line:82%
And her phone has been
switched off ever since.

117
00:06:21.287 --> 00:06:23.620 line:82%
About six months back,
they attempted to run me over.

118
00:06:24.037 --> 00:06:25.204 line:82%
I filed a complaint here.

119
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.079 line:82%
-My phone's broken.
-Sit down, sir.

120
00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:29.579 line:82%
-Wait outside, I'll call you.
-Okay, ma'am.

121
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.620 line:82%
Sit down.
I'll be back.

122
00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:37.120 line:82%
Sit down.

123
00:06:38.454 --> 00:06:39.412 line:82%
Give me the phone.

124
00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:50.537 line:82%
Go back home and wait.

125
00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:52.037 line:82%
I’ll ask the local inspector
to look into it.

126
00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.745 line:82%
Sir, I would like to see the SP
and file a formal complaint.

127
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.870 line:82%
Please, listen, sir.
SP is not here.

128
00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:00.079 line:82%
It's the festival night.
I don’t know if he’ll come to the station.

129
00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:02.704 line:82%
-Sir, I'll wait for sometime.
-Excuse me?

130
00:07:02.787 --> 00:07:04.537 line:82%
Listen to me.
Go home for now.

131
00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:06.037 line:82%
I’ll let you know
if we get any updates.

132
00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:09.579 line:82%
Hello! Excuse me!
Call that man.

133
00:07:09.704 --> 00:07:11.704 line:82%
-Hello, brother! Can't you hear me?
-Sir.

134
00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:13.245 line:82%
Sir, my wife and child are missing.

135
00:07:14.662 --> 00:07:16.954 line:82%
Sir, I just got
his written complaint.

136
00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:18.370 line:82%
But, before we could inquire…

137
00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:23.245 line:82%
-How long have they been gone?
-One and a half hours, sir.

138
00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:26.412 line:82%
Sir.

139
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.745 line:82%
Sir… sir…

140
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.829 line:82%
I was investigating the case, sir.

141
00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.079 line:82%
They’ll be back soon.
Leave.

142
00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:34.995 line:82%
-See him off.
-Sir, they didn't go missing.

143
00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:36.120 line:82%
She went to
Periyavar's
place looking for me,

144
00:07:36.204 --> 00:07:37.245 line:82%
but she hasn’t returned yet.

145
00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:44.204 line:82%
-By
Periyavar
are you referring to Ravi?
-Yes, sir.

146
00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:46.204 line:82%
It is fine if they said she went there
and made a fuss.

147
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.079 line:82%
But they said she never came, sir.

148
00:07:48.204 --> 00:07:49.704 line:82%
-I'm worried sick, sir.
-Is her mobile switched off?

149
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.870 line:82%
It rang briefly
and then switched off.

150
00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:53.329 line:82%
-Did you go to his house?
-Yes, sir.

151
00:07:53.412 --> 00:07:54.537 line:82%
Something’s definitely happened there.

152
00:07:54.662 --> 00:07:55.662 line:82%
I'm worried sick, sir.

153
00:07:55.745 --> 00:07:58.412 line:82%
-His son and I have a bit of bad blood.
-The thing is, brother…

154
00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:02.329 line:82%
If Ravi was involved,
something must have happened.

155
00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:05.787 line:82%
If we don’t get rough with them,
we won’t get any answers.

156
00:08:06.495 --> 00:08:09.037 line:82%
I’ve got to plan it out
and execute it.

157
00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:12.787 line:82%
He’s got his men
all over our department.

158
00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:17.079 line:82%
If he finds out you came to me,
he’ll head straight to court.

159
00:08:17.204 --> 00:08:18.704 line:82%
Then this case
will be out of my hands.

160
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.370 line:82%
I don't get it, sir.

161
00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:25.454 line:82%
Even if he goes to court,
I know how to get him locked up.

162
00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:27.245 line:82%
Sir, what needs to be done?

163
00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:33.370 line:82%
-Serve him the bone marrow.
-Hey.

164
00:08:33.495 --> 00:08:34.912 line:82%
-Let my brother-in-law have it.
-Serve him, come on.

165
00:08:34.954 --> 00:08:35.912 line:82%
I served him some.
You eat, brother.

166
00:08:39.329 --> 00:08:41.579 line:82%
-Let me answer that.
-Enough.

167
00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.662 line:82%
-Shall I serve you some curry?
-I'm good, thank you.

168
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.579 line:82%
It's the Inspector, brother.

169
00:08:49.537 --> 00:08:51.704 line:82%
He won’t stop calling until we answer.
Ask him what’s it about.

170
00:08:51.745 --> 00:08:52.620 line:82%
Okay.

171
00:08:52.995 --> 00:08:53.870 line:82%
Hello?

172
00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:56.329 line:82%
Sir, he’s having his dinner.

173
00:08:57.329 --> 00:08:58.370 line:82%
It's alright, sir.
Tell me.

174
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.287 line:82%
When?

175
00:09:09.204 --> 00:09:11.370 line:82%
-Will you share this with me?
-Okay.

176
00:09:14.245 --> 00:09:15.204 line:82%
I'll be back in a minute.

177
00:09:15.787 --> 00:09:16.787 line:82%
Dear?

178
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.412 line:82%
-In the middle of your meal?
-He'll be back, dear!

179
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.537 line:82%
Go ahead and eat.

180
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.912 line:82%
This will never change!

181
00:09:25.412 --> 00:09:26.954 line:82%
They won't even
let him eat peacefully.

182
00:09:27.204 --> 00:09:28.870 line:82%
Why didn’t you let him know
what happened here?

183
00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:29.954 line:82%
I did tell him.

184
00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:32.329 line:82%
I did tell him she showed up
with her daughter and then took off.

185
00:09:32.662 --> 00:09:33.787 line:82%
What did he say?

186
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:35.787 line:82%
He didn’t hear
a word of what I said.

187
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:37.037 line:82%
What did he say?

188
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.037 line:82%
That…

189
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.954 line:82%
He feels like
they’re up to something.

190
00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:43.620 line:82%
He warned us not to stay here.

191
00:09:44.204 --> 00:09:45.787 line:82%
-Plan? What do you mean?
-Brother…

192
00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:47.037 line:82%
Plan…

193
00:09:50.495 --> 00:09:51.662 line:82%
What does he mean by 'plan'?

194
00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:53.579 line:82%
It could be an encounter.

195
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.912 line:82%
That SP is involved in this.

196
00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:00.579 line:82%
He's been waiting
for a chance like this.

197
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.750 line:82%
Let's act quickly.

198
00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:04.412 line:82%
Brother…

199
00:10:04.579 --> 00:10:07.412 line:82%
How is it possible to make a plan
and carry it out tonight?

200
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:09.704 line:82%
I didn’t fall at DIG’s feet, that’s all.

201
00:10:10.245 --> 00:10:12.412 line:82%
-I can't let this chance slip away, James.
-Sir…

202
00:10:12.662 --> 00:10:15.037 line:82%
They deserve it, of course.
There's no doubt.

203
00:10:15.537 --> 00:10:17.245 line:82%
The festival is happening tonight.
That's why…

204
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.870 line:82%
I’ve forwarded all the reports to DIG.

205
00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:22.412 line:82%
We have to finish them before dawn.
That’s all the time we've got.

206
00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:23.579 line:82%
Got it, sir.

207
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.454 line:82%
Sir?

208
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.037 line:82%
We’ve got permission.
It’s time to take them down tonight.

209
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.745 line:82%
Done deal, sir.
But, it's the festival night…

210
00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:32.579 line:82%
What are you both going on about?

211
00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:34.287 line:82%
Yes, the festival is
indeed happening tonight.

212
00:10:34.412 --> 00:10:35.995 line:82%
You won’t find
a single soul in the town.

213
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.829 line:82%
It's a golden opportunity!
Can't you see that?

214
00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:41.370 line:82%
I requested a transfer here
just to bring these guys down.

215
00:10:41.454 --> 00:10:45.412 line:82%
Sir, I’ve already assigned our Home Guard
and others to festival duty.

216
00:10:45.954 --> 00:10:47.454 line:82%
With the force that we have,
this seems questionable.

217
00:10:47.787 --> 00:10:49.954 line:82%
Have you ever addressed
your batch mate as "Sir"?

218
00:10:50.912 --> 00:10:54.120 line:82%
Didn’t you just hear me begging,
'DIG sir, DIG sir' over the phone?

219
00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:55.495 line:82%
He was my batchmate.

220
00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:57.579 line:82%
I went through hell because of Ravi.

221
00:10:57.704 --> 00:10:59.120 line:82%
I had to serve four years
at the DCRB.

222
00:10:59.204 --> 00:11:00.870 line:82%
Two years in EB vigilance.

223
00:11:00.954 --> 00:11:03.037 line:82%
And two more
in Karur Paper Mill vigilance.

224
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.079 line:82%
I worked my tail off, and groveled
in front of miserable people in power,

225
00:11:06.162 --> 00:11:08.162 line:82%
-just to get to this position.
-Sir.

226
00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:12.745 line:82%
I want them dead!

227
00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:13.912 line:82%
Sir.

228
00:11:14.204 --> 00:11:16.329 line:82%
But still,
my main concern is the logistics.

229
00:11:16.787 --> 00:11:18.620 line:82%
If something goes wrong,
we might lose our jobs.

230
00:11:18.704 --> 00:11:22.037 line:82%
-James, I'll stand by your side.
-Dad!

231
00:11:22.954 --> 00:11:26.037 line:82%
Hey, I told you, right?

232
00:11:26.162 --> 00:11:27.579 line:82%
I don't like it, Dad!

233
00:11:27.662 --> 00:11:28.620 line:82%
What is it that you don't like?

234
00:11:28.704 --> 00:11:29.870 line:82%
-Gokul?
-Sir?

235
00:11:29.995 --> 00:11:30.912 line:82%
How is her dress?

236
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.329 line:82%
It's beautiful, sir.
Looking good, dear.

237
00:11:33.537 --> 00:11:34.787 line:82%
Why should we be afraid, Uncle?

238
00:11:35.037 --> 00:11:36.495 line:82%
If the lady’s found,
there won’t be any trouble, right?

239
00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:38.329 line:82%
He’s doing this out of past grudge.

240
00:11:38.537 --> 00:11:39.370 line:82%
Uncle?

241
00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:42.454 line:82%
Shall I take our men
and search for that lady and her kid?

242
00:11:42.495 --> 00:11:44.745 line:82%
We’ll break into SP's house
and take him down.

243
00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:47.495 line:82%
-Let's face it.
-And after that?

244
00:11:47.912 --> 00:11:49.120 line:82%
Sit back and watch our family crumble?

245
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.454 line:82%
Is this why we gave up everything
to live a respected life here?

246
00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:56.870 line:82%
Businesses to run and kids to care for…

247
00:11:58.704 --> 00:11:59.829 line:82%
Don't do anything!

248
00:12:01.037 --> 00:12:01.954 line:82%
I'll take care of it.

249
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.954 line:82%
That filthy dog…

250
00:12:04.454 --> 00:12:06.329 line:82%
used to never sit
in front of your father.

251
00:12:06.579 --> 00:12:09.370 line:82%
Aunt, did you see
Grandma’s back scratcher?

252
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.537 line:82%
The kids probably
left it here while playing.

253
00:12:16.037 --> 00:12:17.120 line:82%
What did the lawyer say?

254
00:12:17.495 --> 00:12:18.954 line:82%
I only have one concern, sir.

255
00:12:19.454 --> 00:12:20.995 line:82%
We need to lock the city
before they escape.

256
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.495 line:82%
It's done.
What else?

257
00:12:23.037 --> 00:12:25.037 line:82%
Other than that
I don't see any threat.

258
00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.620 line:82%
I’ll guarantee that none of you
face any trouble.

259
00:12:27.787 --> 00:12:28.954 line:82%
Just stay by my side.

260
00:12:29.412 --> 00:12:31.870 line:82%
-Sure, sir.
-The FIR is against Kannan, sir.

261
00:12:31.954 --> 00:12:33.204 line:82%
How can we take down
Periyavar?

262
00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:37.079 line:82%
Sir… sorry, sir.

263
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.204 line:82%
Ravi.

264
00:12:40.787 --> 00:12:42.412 line:82%
Sir, TV installation guys are here.

265
00:12:42.454 --> 00:12:44.120 line:82%
Why?
Can't that moron wait for a bit?

266
00:12:44.245 --> 00:12:45.162 line:82%
Sorry, sir.

267
00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:51.412 line:82%
The plan isn’t to capture both of them.

268
00:12:51.912 --> 00:12:53.204 line:82%
Nab one of them.

269
00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:56.287 line:82%
Arrest one, and the other
will come running.

270
00:12:56.912 --> 00:12:59.120 line:82%
Like birds of a feather,
they stick together!

271
00:12:59.787 --> 00:13:01.579 line:82%
See, Gokul.
I want them today.

272
00:13:10.037 --> 00:13:11.995 line:82%
If we manage to get
that woman's body

273
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.995 line:82%
we can arrest them
without a thought, right?

274
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:17.787 line:82%
Sure, sir.

275
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.745 line:82%
We can arrest
the father and his son, right?

276
00:13:21.537 --> 00:13:23.079 line:82%
We’d have solid evidence
in our hands, sir.

277
00:13:23.995 --> 00:13:25.329 line:82%
Then, without any delay…

278
00:13:25.787 --> 00:13:27.579 line:82%
search for that woman's body.

279
00:13:29.495 --> 00:13:31.412 line:82%
Go to their house
and start the inquiry.

280
00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:32.495 line:82%
Okay, sir.

281
00:13:35.412 --> 00:13:36.412 line:82%
Sir?

282
00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:37.829 line:82%
Sir?

283
00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:40.412 line:82%
What if they didn't kill her?

284
00:13:42.704 --> 00:13:44.079 line:82%
You still don't get it?

285
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:49.162 line:82%
Got it, sir.

286
00:13:50.787 --> 00:13:52.579 line:82%
-Is Shahul here?
-Yes.

287
00:13:53.745 --> 00:13:56.037 line:82%
Let’s hold off on sending
new goods to the quarry tomorrow.

288
00:13:56.662 --> 00:13:59.287 line:82%
Tell them to deliver the load
we have to Hyderabad.

289
00:14:00.162 --> 00:14:02.704 line:82%
Nothing, dear.
He needs to head out for a bit.

290
00:14:02.787 --> 00:14:04.454 line:82%
-Get the kids ready.
-Okay, Aunt.

291
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.870 line:82%
I'll call you if anything happens.

292
00:14:06.204 --> 00:14:07.037 line:82%
Go on.

293
00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:12.287 line:82%
-Dad, let's face it. You shou--
-Listen to me!

294
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.537 line:82%
Nobody is picking up my call.

295
00:14:16.579 --> 00:14:18.995 line:82%
Given that, can’t you feel
he’s planning something big?

296
00:14:20.287 --> 00:14:22.037 line:82%
Leave.
Listen to him.

297
00:14:23.037 --> 00:14:24.537 line:82%
They’ve got an FIR against you,
haven’t they?

298
00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:27.454 line:82%
You’ll be their target now.

299
00:14:28.537 --> 00:14:29.620 line:82%
He's fully aware.

300
00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.370 line:82%
If we make it through tonight,
they can't get to us.

301
00:14:34.704 --> 00:14:35.787 line:82%
He's talking to you.

302
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.079 line:82%
Let him go.

303
00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:44.037 line:82%
Kannan…

304
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:47.954 line:82%
Let's get through tonight.

305
00:14:49.287 --> 00:14:50.745 line:82%
We’ll turn ourselves in
at court tomorrow.

306
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.495 line:82%
Go on.

307
00:15:01.787 --> 00:15:02.787 line:82%
I'm scared.

308
00:15:04.537 --> 00:15:07.495 line:82%
Shall I… have a word with Kaali?

309
00:15:09.204 --> 00:15:11.037 line:82%
He won’t turn down my plea.

310
00:15:15.495 --> 00:15:17.329 line:82%
The blade’s not at our throats yet.

311
00:15:18.579 --> 00:15:19.704 line:82%
It's still far away.

312
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:22.037 line:82%
We’ll act
when it’s about to strike.

313
00:15:23.662 --> 00:15:25.954 line:82%
Get the vehicle ready.
I need to head to SP's office.

314
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:27.245 line:82%
Okay, Uncle.

315
00:15:30.745 --> 00:15:31.995 line:82%
Have you thought this through?

316
00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:34.579 line:82%
Our son's life.

317
00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:37.079 line:82%
Reputation, my foot.

318
00:15:40.912 --> 00:15:42.162 line:82%
-Hey!
-Sir?

319
00:15:42.329 --> 00:15:44.704 line:82%
-Link that to SP office 1.
-Okay, sir.

320
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.954 line:82%
-I’ll access screen mirroring then.
-Okay, sir.

321
00:15:51.162 --> 00:15:52.995 line:82%
You care so much for your son,

322
00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:56.120 line:82%
but what about the one outside
who's lost his family?

323
00:15:56.704 --> 00:15:58.662 line:82%
What do I say to him, Ravi?

324
00:16:01.037 --> 00:16:03.745 line:82%
You want others to value your agony,

325
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.745 line:82%
yet you disregard their suffering.

326
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:06.995 line:82%
No, sir.

327
00:16:07.537 --> 00:16:09.079 line:82%
Tell me what
you need from our side.

328
00:16:09.662 --> 00:16:10.912 line:82%
I'll do anything you demand.

329
00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:15.120 line:82%
What did you do
to that woman and her child?

330
00:16:15.912 --> 00:16:16.787 line:82%
Sir?

331
00:16:17.037 --> 00:16:18.787 line:82%
They left after a while, really.

332
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.370 line:82%
You got him out of reach before
we could start the investigation.

333
00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:25.579 line:82%
Is this what an honorable man does?

334
00:16:26.579 --> 00:16:28.870 line:82%
Why not help with the investigation
if you have nothing to hide?

335
00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:29.829 line:82%
No, sir.

336
00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:32.329 line:82%
We received some info…

337
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.829 line:82%
What do you mean?

338
00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:36.245 line:82%
Tell me clearly.

339
00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:38.204 line:82%
About encounter and stuff…

340
00:16:41.037 --> 00:16:42.829 line:82%
God, what is this?

341
00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:44.662 line:82%
Don't turn me into a bad guy.

342
00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:47.662 line:82%
I’ll never do anything
that’s against the law.

343
00:16:48.537 --> 00:16:50.495 line:82%
It’s been six months
since I got here, hasn’t it?

344
00:16:50.912 --> 00:16:52.829 line:82%
Did I ever try to mess with you?

345
00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:54.954 line:82%
-Sir?
-Ask your son to come here.

346
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.162 line:82%
The FIR is filed against him,
so he has to be investigated.

347
00:16:58.829 --> 00:17:00.495 line:82%
He is my only son, sir.

348
00:17:01.037 --> 00:17:03.204 line:82%
I’ll ask him to surrender
at the court tomorrow.

349
00:17:03.745 --> 00:17:05.537 line:82%
If you help him out--

350
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.495 line:82%
HEY!

351
00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:09.162 line:82%
What's with that glare?

352
00:17:10.787 --> 00:17:13.245 line:82%
What?
What is it, damn it!

353
00:17:14.162 --> 00:17:15.079 line:82%
Sir?

354
00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:18.245 line:82%
-I didn't--
-Wait outside.

355
00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.120 line:82%
Sorry, sir.

356
00:17:25.662 --> 00:17:27.995 line:82%
Forgive him.
He didn't know what he was doing.

357
00:17:33.579 --> 00:17:34.579 line:82%
Sir?

358
00:17:34.995 --> 00:17:36.495 line:82%
Let me be frank with you.

359
00:17:37.162 --> 00:17:38.245 line:82%
My son's life.

360
00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:40.287 line:82%
Please help us out.

361
00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:42.704 line:82%
Ravi!

362
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.579 line:82%
Look for a fool to fall for your tricks.

363
00:17:46.412 --> 00:17:48.787 line:82%
You sketched and executed
everything perfectly…

364
00:17:49.954 --> 00:17:53.329 line:82%
Didn’t you say you would
present your son in court?

365
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.495 line:82%
Do it if you can.

366
00:18:05.495 --> 00:18:06.370 line:82%
Uncle?

367
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.870 line:82%
-What did he say?
-Tell Kannan to turn off his mobile.

368
00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:12.370 line:82%
-He should cross the border in an hour.
-Yes, Uncle.

369
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.579 line:82%
She came here around 6:45 p.m.

370
00:18:21.162 --> 00:18:23.454 line:82%
and within 20 minutes
she left with her daughter.

371
00:18:23.787 --> 00:18:24.745 line:82%
She left?

372
00:18:24.995 --> 00:18:28.204 line:82%
-What happened?
-Hey, listen. Where are you going?

373
00:18:28.454 --> 00:18:30.579 line:82%
Mom, what is happening?

374
00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:33.745 line:82%
-Where did you bring that from?
-Where are you taking her to?

375
00:18:33.787 --> 00:18:35.412 line:82%
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

376
00:18:36.412 --> 00:18:37.954 line:82%
I'll call my brother.

377
00:18:38.037 --> 00:18:40.037 line:82%
-I don't have a good feeling about this.
-Don't! Don't call him.

378
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.120 line:82%
Don't.

379
00:18:46.204 --> 00:18:47.079 line:82%
What's going on?

380
00:18:48.412 --> 00:18:49.579 line:82%
Hey!

381
00:18:50.204 --> 00:18:52.120 line:82%
What the hell are you doing?
Barging into our house?

382
00:18:53.245 --> 00:18:54.912 line:82%
My husband will get here soon.

383
00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:56.995 line:82%
Yes, let him come home.

384
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.454 line:82%
What the hell is this?
How did that get in here?

385
00:18:59.579 --> 00:19:00.579 line:82%
You should tell me that!

386
00:19:00.704 --> 00:19:02.412 line:82%
We found the lady's body.

387
00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:03.620 line:82%
What did you do to the child?

388
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.662 line:82%
What tales are you spinning?

389
00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:07.745 line:82%
Let go of me, sir!
Let go of me!

390
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.079 line:82%
We dug that out of your backyard.
Don't act shocked.

391
00:19:10.162 --> 00:19:11.370 line:82%
-You took the video?
-Yes, sir.

392
00:19:11.412 --> 00:19:12.870 line:82%
-Documented everything, right?
-Yes.

393
00:19:12.912 --> 00:19:14.287 line:82%
Then, our job here is done.

394
00:19:15.662 --> 00:19:17.495 line:82%
From where did you get the body?

395
00:19:17.745 --> 00:19:18.704 line:82%
Tell me!

396
00:19:18.995 --> 00:19:21.495 line:82%
-Tell the truth!
-Hey, did you see her face?

397
00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:22.954 line:82%
Did you, damn it?

398
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.495 line:82%
Then how can you be
so sure the body isn’t hers?

399
00:19:26.912 --> 00:19:28.912 line:82%
If it's not around the house,
where did you bury her?

400
00:19:29.745 --> 00:19:31.579 line:82%
Acting all innocent
after committing a murder?

401
00:19:31.954 --> 00:19:33.870 line:82%
Wait, I'll bring each
and everyone of you down!

402
00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:43.787 line:82%
Hey, it's okay.

403
00:19:43.954 --> 00:19:45.662 line:82%
They're doing all this
to find your family.

404
00:19:47.204 --> 00:19:49.245 line:82%
Imagine being told to claim
a stranger’s body as your wife.

405
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.787 line:82%
You’ll understand my pain then.

406
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.495 line:82%
Shankar!
Wait!

407
00:20:00.704 --> 00:20:01.829 line:82%
-What is it, dear?
-
Dad…

408
00:20:01.912 --> 00:20:03.954 line:82%
-
The police have brought a corpse.
-Hello?

409
00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:07.079 line:82%
-What happened?
-
They're saying they'll file a rape case.

410
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.995 line:82%
Tell me clearly.

411
00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:10.829 line:82%
Don't come home, Dad.
They'll file a rape case.

412
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:11.870 line:82%
Give the phone to your mom.

413
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.787 line:82%
-
Mom…
-Stop the car.

414
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.329 line:82%
Mom, come here.

415
00:20:15.537 --> 00:20:17.287 line:82%
Here. Tell Dad.

416
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.662 line:82%
-
Hello, dear?
-What's wrong?

417
00:20:19.704 --> 00:20:23.579 line:82%
The cops brought in a body,
saying it’s that woman's.

418
00:20:23.662 --> 00:20:25.495 line:82%
-Okay. Relax.
-
They're saying they'll file a rape case.

419
00:20:25.537 --> 00:20:27.079 line:82%
-We'll figure something.
-
Don't come home.

420
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.620 line:82%
-I'll take care.
-
Warn Kannan.

421
00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:29.995 line:82%
I said I'll take care.

422
00:20:31.037 --> 00:20:32.912 line:82%
Call our lawyer
and ask him to come home.

423
00:20:33.245 --> 00:20:35.370 line:82%
-Inform Rajasekar about this.
-
Okay.

424
00:20:36.162 --> 00:20:37.204 line:82%
Don't call me.

425
00:20:37.287 --> 00:20:38.495 line:82%
Switch off your phone.

426
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.745 line:82%
-I'll call Sreeja when I can.
-Okay.

427
00:20:42.245 --> 00:20:45.079 line:82%
-Ask Kannan to be careful.
-You stay strong.

428
00:20:45.162 --> 00:20:47.204 line:82%
-You stay safe.
-Okay.

429
00:20:49.954 --> 00:20:50.912 line:82%
What's wrong, Uncle?

430
00:20:53.537 --> 00:20:54.995 line:82%
We need a different car.

431
00:20:56.954 --> 00:20:57.954 line:82%
I'll arrange for it.

432
00:21:00.495 --> 00:21:01.370 line:82%
Hello?

433
00:21:13.329 --> 00:21:14.620 line:82%
The car will be here in ten minutes.

434
00:21:16.204 --> 00:21:17.704 line:82%
-Venkat.
-Yes, Uncle.

435
00:21:20.537 --> 00:21:21.662 line:82%
It's brother.

436
00:21:22.037 --> 00:21:24.537 line:82%
She told him everything?
I told her not to say anything!

437
00:21:26.412 --> 00:21:27.287 line:82%
Hey!

438
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:30.204 line:82%
-Dad, we got dragged unnecessarily.
-I told you I'll call.

439
00:21:30.287 --> 00:21:32.412 line:82%
-Listen to me.
-I'll take down that SP.

440
00:21:32.454 --> 00:21:34.287 line:82%
-Dad, I can't digest this.
-This is exactly what he wants.

441
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.204 line:82%
-And that's what he's doing.
-Our hard-earned reputation is down the drain.

442
00:21:37.412 --> 00:21:38.579 line:82%
-Kannan…
-Dad?

443
00:21:39.495 --> 00:21:41.579 line:82%
-Kannan?
-We have to kill him, Dad!

444
00:21:41.662 --> 00:21:43.912 line:82%
I've decided,
we must take that SP down!

445
00:21:45.579 --> 00:21:46.870 line:82%
He should definitely die.

446
00:21:47.037 --> 00:21:48.912 line:82%
But it should be done
without involving us.

447
00:21:49.704 --> 00:21:51.370 line:82%
If things go wrong,
it’ll ruin everything.

448
00:21:51.495 --> 00:21:53.662 line:82%
-Then how are we going to do it?
-He should die before dawn.

449
00:21:54.287 --> 00:21:55.329 line:82%
I'll take care.

450
00:22:01.704 --> 00:22:02.954 line:82%
Where is Kaali?

451
00:22:16.412 --> 00:22:19.037 line:82%
Sir, why aren’t we using
our own guys from here?

452
00:22:19.162 --> 00:22:21.120 line:82%
Are you sure it’s a good idea
to turn to him after all this time?

453
00:22:22.704 --> 00:22:24.245 line:82%
Do you remember that incident?

454
00:22:26.662 --> 00:22:28.662 line:82%
We can’t plan this out
and take it slow.

455
00:22:29.662 --> 00:22:32.537 line:82%
Every moment the SP lives
is a threat to my son.

456
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.787 line:82%
Henchmen won’t be effective.

457
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.412 line:82%
Only a faithful ally can do this.

458
00:23:18.329 --> 00:23:20.537 line:82%
Hey, Sathyamoorthy.
New shirt, is it?

459
00:23:20.995 --> 00:23:22.120 line:82%
What is it?

460
00:23:22.954 --> 00:23:23.995 line:82%
Hold. Let me check.

461
00:23:24.287 --> 00:23:26.329 line:82%
My eldest has been calling.

462
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.829 line:82%
Your husband is here.

463
00:23:29.329 --> 00:23:30.370 line:82%
See you, sister.

464
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.370 line:82%
Why so late?
The kids would be hungry.

465
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.495 line:82%
Go fast.
Biriyani might get over.

466
00:23:39.787 --> 00:23:41.120 line:82%
Is this what took you so long?

467
00:23:42.495 --> 00:23:43.954 line:82%
-See you!
-Okay.

468
00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:48.579 line:82%
-Ah!
-What happened, Kalai?

469
00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:51.329 line:82%
I'm good, sister.

470
00:23:54.537 --> 00:23:56.287 line:82%
Get down.
You sit after I sit.

471
00:23:56.912 --> 00:23:58.079 line:82%
Come on. Sit.

472
00:23:58.329 --> 00:24:01.287 line:82%
-No, I won't. You--
-Hey! I won't do anything. Sit.

473
00:24:07.162 --> 00:24:08.329 line:82%
Hmm.

474
00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:14.912 line:82%
Won't you ever change?

475
00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:17.079 line:82%
You’re no longer young.
You’re a father of two.

476
00:24:18.037 --> 00:24:19.537 line:82%
-You leave. I'll take the share auto.
-Hey, hey!

477
00:24:19.912 --> 00:24:20.870 line:82%
Hop on.

478
00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:22.662 line:82%
All okay, Kalai?

479
00:24:22.912 --> 00:24:24.204 line:82%

00:28:22.204 --> 00:28:23.370 line:82%
How are you, brother?

532
00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:28.370 line:82%
-I've been sitting here for so long.
-Kaali, get me this.

00:28:33.787 --> 00:28:34.954 line:82%
-Hey…
-Sister-in-law.

534
00:28:35.037 --> 00:28:36.912 line:82%
Come soon.
I need kerosene.

535
00:28:36.954 --> 00:28:38.204 line:82%
I was cooking,
it got over halfway.

536
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.245 line:82%
Isn't my daughter there?

537
00:28:39.537 --> 00:28:42.454 line:82%
She measures to the tee, unlike you.

538
00:28:45.037 --> 00:28:45.995 line:82%
Wait for some time.

539
00:28:51.287 --> 00:28:53.454 line:82%
-Hey, sit inside.
-It's alright, brother.

540
00:28:53.537 --> 00:28:55.454 line:82%
-Half a litre?
-A packet of turmeric, too.

541
00:28:55.495 --> 00:28:57.370 line:82%
-Give it to me. Please.
-No, thank you. It's okay.

542
00:28:58.162 --> 00:29:00.120 line:82%
Hey, did you see
what I've bought for you?

543
00:29:00.454 --> 00:29:01.870 line:82%
-I'm going first.
-Hey, stop.

544
00:29:04.579 --> 00:29:05.870 line:82%
-Hey!
-Careful!

545
00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:06.829 line:82%
Can't you see?

546
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.662 line:82%
I've told you a zillion times
not to put this sack here.

547
00:29:08.745 --> 00:29:10.579 line:82%
Ask him to
watch his step while walking.

548
00:29:10.704 --> 00:29:11.579 line:82%
Are you hurt?

549
00:29:11.829 --> 00:29:13.662 line:82%
-What did you ask for?
-Dry chilli.

550
00:29:14.245 --> 00:29:15.162 line:82%
One packet is enough?

551
00:29:15.204 --> 00:29:17.245 line:82%
-That's it.
-Dad, I can't find the fan.

552
00:29:19.537 --> 00:29:20.579 line:82%
I'll get it from the festival.

553
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.329 line:82%
You said you bought it
over the phone.

554
00:29:22.412 --> 00:29:23.287 line:82%
What did you do?

555
00:29:23.412 --> 00:29:26.120 line:82%
-Mom…
-Add this to my account.

556
00:29:26.204 --> 00:29:28.745 line:82%
-Okay. I'll do.
-Don't forget while talking to your daughter.

557
00:29:28.787 --> 00:29:30.245 line:82%
I won't.

558
00:29:31.704 --> 00:29:32.745 line:82%
Why is he here?

559
00:29:34.995 --> 00:29:35.912 line:82%
-No idea.
-Kaali.

560
00:29:36.329 --> 00:29:37.245 line:82%
One packet of milk.

561
00:29:38.495 --> 00:29:39.412 line:82%
You go talk to him.

562
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.245 line:82%
-Anything else?
-Sugar for ten rupees.

563
00:29:46.704 --> 00:29:48.662 line:82%
Mom… You also eat.

564
00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.579 line:82%
Come, we'll eat together.

565
00:29:51.787 --> 00:29:53.287 line:82%
I asked him to eat.
But he said no.

566
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.912 line:82%
-Thank you. I'm good for now. You eat.
-Okay.

567
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.495 line:82%
Our dinner time is usually 7:30.
Got late today.

568
00:29:59.204 --> 00:30:00.829 line:82%
-Want some tea?
-No, thank you.

569
00:30:02.787 --> 00:30:05.079 line:82%
Make it fast, Mom.
We need to go to the festival.

570
00:30:05.454 --> 00:30:07.204 line:82%
I'm ready to go like this.

571
00:30:07.537 --> 00:30:08.787 line:82%
Only he has to get ready.

572
00:30:09.495 --> 00:30:10.870 line:82%
-Brother.
-Here.

573
00:30:11.704 --> 00:30:13.120 line:82%
Uncle is here.

574
00:30:13.329 --> 00:30:15.037 line:82%
-Who?!
-Uncle.

575
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.370 line:82%
Where is he?

576
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.579 line:82%
Upstairs.

577
00:30:29.287 --> 00:30:31.204 line:82%
-What else?
-A packet of vermicelli.

578
00:30:34.162 --> 00:30:35.037 line:82%
Only one?

579
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.287 line:82%
Yes. That's it.

580
00:30:38.745 --> 00:30:39.870 line:82%
Forty rupees.

581
00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:04.287 line:82%
Sir.

582
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:07.829 line:82%
Sir?

583
00:31:13.245 --> 00:31:14.287 line:82%
Kaali!

584
00:31:20.412 --> 00:31:21.495 line:82%
How are you?

585
00:31:23.287 --> 00:31:24.579 line:82%
I heard your second child is a son.

586
00:31:25.745 --> 00:31:26.787 line:82%
Yes, sir.

587
00:31:28.329 --> 00:31:29.704 line:82%
Let's go down and talk.

588
00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:32.704 line:82%
It's okay. Let's stay here.
I need to talk.

589
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.370 line:82%
Sure. Why don't we go down and--

590
00:31:35.454 --> 00:31:37.370 line:82%
-He's still the same.
-Yes, Uncle.

591
00:31:37.495 --> 00:31:41.704 line:82%
Even now, I was talking about
that Sudhakar incident.

592
00:31:41.995 --> 00:31:44.037 line:82%
-Yes. It gives me goosebumps even now.
-Hey!

593
00:31:44.912 --> 00:31:46.204 line:82%
Why talk about the past?

594
00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:48.370 line:82%
-Our guys don't believe it--
-Hey!

595
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.745 line:82%
-Let's go down and talk, sir.
-Kaali.

596
00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.454 line:82%
I want to talk to you.

597
00:32:01.704 --> 00:32:03.787 line:82%
Hey! How many times have I told you?

598
00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:11.454 line:82%
-Dilip, ask Dad if they want tea or coffee.
-Okay, Mom.

599
00:32:11.495 --> 00:32:12.537 line:82%
Hey!

600
00:32:13.162 --> 00:32:13.995 line:82%
Okay.

601
00:32:14.787 --> 00:32:15.912 line:82%
Give me two hours.

602
00:32:16.579 --> 00:32:18.495 line:82%
I'll find that lady and her child.

603
00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:22.495 line:82%
Kaali, ever since that SP took charge,
he’s been nothing but a headache.

604
00:32:22.995 --> 00:32:24.620 line:82%
And now they have a reason.

605
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.329 line:82%
-He's holding on to--
-Listen to me.

606
00:32:28.287 --> 00:32:29.620 line:82%
What if we eliminate the cause?

607
00:32:29.954 --> 00:32:30.912 line:82%
What will he do?

608
00:32:31.245 --> 00:32:34.245 line:82%
Kaali, this is just a lame excuse
to carry out an encounter operation.

609
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.454 line:82%
They've cornered us.

610
00:32:38.204 --> 00:32:39.704 line:82%
How do I explain…

611
00:32:42.829 --> 00:32:44.412 line:82%
My son's life is on the line here.

612
00:32:45.954 --> 00:32:47.037 line:82%
Sir.

613
00:32:48.787 --> 00:32:50.079 line:82%
I'm a father of two.

614
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.162 line:82%
I’ve done unspeakable wrongs.

615
00:32:54.829 --> 00:32:59.079 line:82%
Every day, I ask God
not to let them suffer for my mistakes.

616
00:32:59.454 --> 00:33:01.162 line:82%
Tea or coffee, Dad?

617
00:33:01.662 --> 00:33:02.620 line:82%
Anything is okay.

618
00:33:02.912 --> 00:33:05.537 line:82%
-What's your name?
-Come on, Dad. Choose one.

619
00:33:05.829 --> 00:33:07.537 line:82%
Hey, he's asking you.

620
00:33:07.912 --> 00:33:09.579 line:82%
-Dilip.
-It's okay--

621
00:33:12.662 --> 00:33:13.829 line:82%
Tell Mom to make tea.

622
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:15.370 line:82%
Careful.

623
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.995 line:82%
-Mom. Dad is talking some secret.
-Dilip!

624
00:33:20.287 --> 00:33:21.495 line:82%
Grandma…

625
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.662 line:82%
-Mom. One tea and one coffee.
-Dilip, come here.

626
00:33:25.954 --> 00:33:27.662 line:82%
You’re the only person I can rely on.

627
00:33:28.037 --> 00:33:29.120 line:82%
Only you can do it.

628
00:33:30.662 --> 00:33:31.662 line:82%
Sir.

629
00:33:32.912 --> 00:33:35.120 line:82%
I’m heavily in debt
and finding it hard to pay the school fees.

630
00:33:35.704 --> 00:33:36.620 line:82%
This…

631
00:33:38.287 --> 00:33:40.912 line:82%
This house is still unfinished
because I don’t have enough money.

632
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.370 line:82%
Yet, when I go to bed at night,

633
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.287 line:82%
I sleep peacefully.

634
00:33:53.704 --> 00:33:54.787 line:82%
I don't want to lose it.

635
00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:56.204 line:82%
Kaali.

636
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.537 line:82%
Kaali?

637
00:33:57.787 --> 00:33:59.412 line:82%
You're also like a son to me.

638
00:34:02.495 --> 00:34:03.454 line:82%
Sir…

639
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.704 line:82%
I'm ready to do anything for you.

640
00:34:08.787 --> 00:34:09.870 line:82%
That's my duty.

641
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.787 line:82%
But not this. Please.

642
00:34:16.495 --> 00:34:17.704 line:82%
Without me…

643
00:34:18.662 --> 00:34:20.162 line:82%
-My family will--
-Kaali, please.

644
00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.870 line:82%
Just do this for me.

645
00:34:22.787 --> 00:34:24.120 line:82%
I'll get someone else to surrender.

646
00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:26.495 line:82%
You can't trust people these days.

647
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.704 line:82%
I'll get Venkat to surrender.

648
00:34:29.204 --> 00:34:30.120 line:82%
Will that do?

649
00:34:31.287 --> 00:34:33.995 line:82%
He’s done that for you before, too.

650
00:34:34.329 --> 00:34:36.120 line:82%
No one knows about it.

651
00:34:36.412 --> 00:34:37.870 line:82%
No one will know it's you.

652
00:34:38.204 --> 00:34:39.245 line:82%
I guarantee.

653
00:34:44.704 --> 00:34:45.704 line:82%
Sorry, sir.

654
00:34:46.412 --> 00:34:47.495 line:82%
I can't.

655
00:34:48.537 --> 00:34:49.954 line:82%
I switched my phone
on the way here.

656
00:34:50.537 --> 00:34:51.787 line:82%
Even the car.

657
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.912 line:82%
I've parked far from your house.

658
00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:57.745 line:82%
I promise
your name won’t come up, Kaali.

659
00:34:58.037 --> 00:34:59.204 line:82%
Trust me.

660
00:35:01.662 --> 00:35:03.162 line:82%
I came all this way for you.

661
00:35:03.912 --> 00:35:06.037 line:82%
Sir… I really can't.

662
00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:07.037 line:82%
Kaali…

663
00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:09.370 line:82%
-Please save me.
-Sir, please don't!

664
00:35:09.495 --> 00:35:11.412 line:82%
-Sir!
-It's my son's life.

665
00:35:11.954 --> 00:35:14.495 line:82%
-I'll do it, Sir!
-For your mom.

666
00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.954 line:82%
-Get up, Sir!
-Kaali.

667
00:35:19.162 --> 00:35:20.412 line:82%
What happened?

668
00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:31.329 line:82%
Keep it there.

669
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.329 line:82%
-What does he want?
-Keep it and go.

670
00:35:37.704 --> 00:35:38.745 line:82%
No. Don't believe them.

671
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:41.454 line:82%
Whatever they say,
don’t fall for it.

672
00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.120 line:82%
Okay. You go.

673
00:35:45.329 --> 00:35:46.454 line:82%
Kaali…

674
00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:12.995 line:82%
Tell me the truth, sir.

675
00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:17.620 line:82%
We didn’t harm the girl
or her mother, did we?

676
00:36:18.745 --> 00:36:21.412 line:82%
Poor guy, sir.
He lost both his wife and child.

677
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:22.912 line:82%
Sir…

678
00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:25.245 line:82%
I've sent all the reports
to the DIG office.

679
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:27.162 line:82%
Sir…

680
00:36:28.662 --> 00:36:30.704 line:82%
Sir… thank you, sir.

681
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.079 line:82%
Hey, what's that smell?
Ask someone to get rid of it.

682
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:35.954 line:82%
Okay, sir.

683
00:36:36.454 --> 00:36:38.620 line:82%
-James, IG has accepted.
-Super, sir.

684
00:36:39.329 --> 00:36:41.870 line:82%
Muthuraj, this one's not
like our usual cases.

685
00:36:42.537 --> 00:36:44.370 line:82%
We can't put off the plan
until another day.

686
00:36:44.995 --> 00:36:46.287 line:82%
If we mess this up,
it's gone forever.

687
00:36:46.662 --> 00:36:48.704 line:82%
That’s why I asked for you specifically.

688
00:36:49.454 --> 00:36:50.495 line:82%
Can we get this over with by tonight?

689
00:36:51.329 --> 00:36:52.745 line:82%
Three kilometers, Kaali.

690
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:56.662 line:82%
Normally, you won’t see a soul
over there once night falls.

691
00:36:56.745 --> 00:36:57.745 line:82%
We just need a gun.

692
00:36:57.995 --> 00:36:59.245 line:82%
Tonight’s the festival night.

693
00:36:59.745 --> 00:37:01.745 line:82%
Lakeside is the right spot.

694
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.454 line:82%
If the white van shows up,
there might be at least ten men there.

695
00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:07.745 line:82%
He's just going home.

696
00:37:08.162 --> 00:37:09.245 line:82%
The van won't be coming.

697
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:11.037 line:82%
Just the gunman.

698
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.245 line:82%
Gun won't work.

699
00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.870 line:82%
The vehicle will be on the move.

700
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.745 line:82%
If we miss our aim…
There will be a driver with the gunman.

701
00:37:24.204 --> 00:37:25.287 line:82%
The news will travel fast.

702
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:29.579 line:82%
Once you get to the middle of the lakeside,
stop the car and open the doors.

703
00:37:29.787 --> 00:37:32.787 line:82%
-Okay, sir.
-Those guys… will understand.

704
00:37:33.495 --> 00:37:35.204 line:82%
-Okay, sir.
-They will be…

705
00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:37.954 line:82%
begging me.

706
00:37:38.537 --> 00:37:42.162 line:82%
Shoot them straight in those
begging hands.

707
00:37:42.412 --> 00:37:46.579 line:82%
They'll start running like
slaughter pigs, fearing their lives.

708
00:37:47.745 --> 00:37:49.079 line:82%
Let them run.

709
00:37:49.662 --> 00:37:55.370 line:82%
As they're running,
launch a bullet in Kannan's left shoulder.

710
00:37:55.954 --> 00:37:59.204 line:82%
Only then will he lose balance,
and look at my eyes.

711
00:37:59.787 --> 00:38:02.620 line:82%
When he looks at me,
puncture his lungs and heart.

712
00:38:02.662 --> 00:38:03.495 line:82%
Pop, pop!

713
00:38:03.537 --> 00:38:04.454 line:82%
Got it?

714
00:38:04.537 --> 00:38:05.370 line:82%
Got it, sir.

715
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.620 line:82%
Then the
Periyavar…
Ravi.

716
00:38:08.204 --> 00:38:09.370 line:82%
He'll cry his heart out.

717
00:38:10.037 --> 00:38:11.412 line:82%
Let him cry for a couple of minutes.

718
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.120 line:82%
Then, hit him, too.

719
00:38:14.995 --> 00:38:17.495 line:82%
Let the dad and son die
looking at me.

720
00:38:19.037 --> 00:38:20.412 line:82%
-Understood?
-We'll get it done, sir.

721
00:38:23.204 --> 00:38:24.537 line:82%
Yeah?
Where?

722
00:38:24.995 --> 00:38:26.870 line:82%
Super.
Bring him to the spot.

723
00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:29.079 line:82%
Sir, we got the son-in-law.

724
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:35.329 line:82%
Hit him hard.
His cries should echo through Ravi's home.

725
00:38:39.995 --> 00:38:42.079 line:82%
We haven’t moved things out
of the old house, right?

726
00:38:43.037 --> 00:38:44.829 line:82%
We took just a couple of things.
Why?

727
00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:51.704 line:82%
Yam
is in there, right?

728
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.662 line:82%
The
yam…

729
00:38:55.704 --> 00:38:56.704 line:82%
It…

730
00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.954 line:82%
-Its condition might be…
-No, it will work.

731
00:39:01.162 --> 00:39:01.995 line:82%
Kaali…

732
00:39:02.287 --> 00:39:03.162 line:82%
This will work.

733
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.579 line:82%
This will work perfectly.

734
00:39:08.787 --> 00:39:10.162 line:82%
Do you remember
where we got it from?

735
00:39:12.162 --> 00:39:13.829 line:82%
No record will be found,
no matter how deep they dig.

736
00:39:14.995 --> 00:39:16.079 line:82%
We won't mess up, right?

737
00:39:16.704 --> 00:39:18.370 line:82%
If we fail, they'll issue
a shooting order against us.

738
00:39:18.454 --> 00:39:19.412 line:82%
I'll take care of it.

739
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.329 line:82%
That's exactly
what I needed to hear.

740
00:39:21.954 --> 00:39:22.829 line:82%
Venkat.

741
00:39:23.704 --> 00:39:24.829 line:82%
Hey, Venkat.

742
00:39:24.912 --> 00:39:25.787 line:82%
Brother!

743
00:39:28.495 --> 00:39:30.829 line:82%
-I need a new phone and SIM.
-Okay, Uncle.

744
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:33.787 line:82%
Ma'am!
Excuse me, ma'am!

745
00:39:34.454 --> 00:39:36.120 line:82%
Here. Your husband's speaking.
Talk to him.

746
00:39:36.245 --> 00:39:39.620 line:82%
-Hold his head straight!
-My husband? Hey!

747
00:39:39.787 --> 00:39:41.870 line:82%
-Oh, it's your husband?
-Bash him up!

748
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.870 line:82%
I'm asking you.
Why the hell are you staying quiet?

749
00:39:57.912 --> 00:39:58.829 line:82%
What was that?

750
00:39:58.954 --> 00:40:00.454 line:82%
-A mosquito coil, please.
-Where are you going?

751
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.204 line:82%
Anything else?

752
00:40:03.245 --> 00:40:04.537 line:82%
-Can I get coconut for 5 rupees?
-Kaali.

753
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:06.787 line:82%
I'm asking you.

754
00:40:09.954 --> 00:40:12.954 line:82%
He needs a driver
to deliver the loads.

755
00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:15.579 line:82%
Is that why that man
is falling at your feet?

756
00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:19.662 line:82%
You don't trust me, do you?

757
00:40:19.995 --> 00:40:20.787 line:82%
Here you go.

758
00:40:21.412 --> 00:40:23.495 line:82%
-HEY!
-You could've given me the money instead.

759
00:40:23.537 --> 00:40:24.579 line:82%
Shut up and go away.

760
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.037 line:82%
Why are you doing this?

761
00:40:27.495 --> 00:40:28.912 line:82%
I said I'll be back
in two hours.

762
00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:34.454 line:82%
Stay here.
Don't go anywhere.

763
00:40:36.995 --> 00:40:38.079 line:82%
I'll come back
and take you to the festival.

764
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:39.954 line:82%
Don't go anywhere.

765
00:40:43.912 --> 00:40:44.870 line:82%
-Dear?
-Dad?

766
00:40:45.579 --> 00:40:47.870 line:82%
Let's go to the festival
once I'm back.

767
00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:49.620 line:82%
I'll be back soon, Dilip.

768
00:40:49.787 --> 00:40:50.870 line:82%
Kaali.

769
00:40:51.037 --> 00:40:53.495 line:82%
-Kaali, listen. Kaali.
-You promise every time but never take us.

770
00:40:53.787 --> 00:40:55.245 line:82%
-Listen to me, Kaali.
-Dad!

771
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.579 line:82%
I'm talking to you.

772
00:40:56.662 --> 00:40:57.537 line:82%
-Mom…
-What's wrong with you?

773
00:40:58.204 --> 00:40:59.287 line:82%
I said I'll be back.

774
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.829 line:82%
Our kids are watching.

775
00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:03.412 line:82%
You're lying.

776
00:41:07.412 --> 00:41:09.329 line:82%
Mom, I want to ride the giant wheel.

777
00:41:10.537 --> 00:41:11.537 line:82%
-Hey!
-Grandma!

778
00:41:12.245 --> 00:41:14.329 line:82%
Kaali, open the door.

779
00:41:14.662 --> 00:41:15.870 line:82%
-Open up!
-Gosh!

780
00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:17.120 line:82%
Why the hell are you shouting?

781
00:41:17.745 --> 00:41:19.287 line:82%
-I'll be there.
-Kaali…

782
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.912 line:82%
Those four years,
with a baby in hand…

783
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.662 line:82%
we were wandering around
with no place to go.

784
00:41:23.995 --> 00:41:24.829 line:82%
Did you forget?

785
00:41:25.412 --> 00:41:28.120 line:82%
Janani wet the bed
just the day before yesterday.

786
00:41:28.495 --> 00:41:29.829 line:82%
She's still terrified.

787
00:41:33.787 --> 00:41:38.162 line:82%
Kaali, that guy will crawl at your feet
to get his work done.

788
00:41:41.787 --> 00:41:43.037 line:82%
You think I don't know that?

789
00:41:43.995 --> 00:41:45.037 line:82%
I'll be back--

790
00:41:45.454 --> 00:41:46.704 line:82%
Leave this
and tell me truth.

791
00:41:46.787 --> 00:41:48.495 line:82%
Why the hell
did that man come here?

792
00:41:48.954 --> 00:41:49.912 line:82%
Fool!

793
00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.495 line:82%
You really think I’d act without
thinking about you and the kids?

794
00:41:55.287 --> 00:41:58.245 line:82%
He wanted a favor.

795
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:03.162 line:82%
One look at the way you breath,
and I’ll know if you’re lying.

796
00:42:03.329 --> 00:42:04.829 line:82%
Wait.
Janani!

797
00:42:05.162 --> 00:42:06.162 line:82%
-Hey!
-Janani, come here.

798
00:42:06.204 --> 00:42:07.204 line:82%
-Yes, Mom!
-Quick. Come here.

799
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.204 line:82%
-Why do you have to--
-Stand here.

800
00:42:09.287 --> 00:42:11.579 line:82%
You're really going
as a driver, right?

801
00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:13.495 line:82%
Swear on her that
you're only going to drive.

802
00:42:13.704 --> 00:42:15.704 line:82%
Come on. Do it!

803
00:42:17.079 --> 00:42:17.995 line:82%
Why would you…?

804
00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:20.412 line:82%
-It's nothing, dear.
-Dad?

805
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:27.954 line:82%
Alright.

806
00:42:28.704 --> 00:42:30.162 line:82%
I'm not going.
Happy?

807
00:42:30.704 --> 00:42:31.662 line:82%
Move.

808
00:42:44.037 --> 00:42:44.912 line:82%
Hey…

809
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:48.495 line:82%
He didn't come begging to me.

810
00:42:51.204 --> 00:42:54.579 line:82%
He showed up to say
he knows where my kids live.

811
00:42:55.162 --> 00:42:56.037 line:82%
Dad?

812
00:42:57.412 --> 00:42:58.370 line:82%
Alright.

813
00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:00.162 line:82%
So?

814
00:43:02.662 --> 00:43:03.870 line:82%
I'm not going.

815
00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:07.370 line:82%
I'm not going.
Happy now?

816
00:43:08.537 --> 00:43:09.704 line:82%
I am not going.

817
00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:19.995 line:82%
-Sir.
-Sir.

818
00:43:22.037 --> 00:43:23.412 line:82%
-Is this information correct?
-Yes, sir.

819
00:43:23.745 --> 00:43:26.370 line:82%
Kannan is at the Avaniyapuram rice mill.

820
00:43:26.912 --> 00:43:28.120 line:82%
-Did he say so?
-No, sir.

821
00:43:28.537 --> 00:43:30.245 line:82%
It's an internal information.
Ravi is not there.

822
00:43:30.287 --> 00:43:31.537 line:82%
But Kannan is in the rice mill.

823
00:43:31.704 --> 00:43:32.620 line:82%
Gokul.

824
00:43:33.537 --> 00:43:35.329 line:82%
-We shouldn't miss it.
-Sure, sir.

825
00:43:35.454 --> 00:43:37.162 line:82%
Go with the team
and get them.

826
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:38.204 line:82%
Okay, sir.

827
00:43:38.245 --> 00:43:39.079 line:82%
Let's go.

828
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.079 line:82%
-James.
-Sir?

829
00:43:40.495 --> 00:43:42.662 line:82%
Make sure he's okay.
We'll get Ravi.

830
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.287 line:82%
Hey, lift him up.

831
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:46.204 line:82%
-Who's there?
-Shush.

832
00:43:47.287 --> 00:43:48.495 line:82%
-Hello?
-Shush.

833
00:43:50.412 --> 00:43:51.412 line:82%
Shush.

834
00:43:53.037 --> 00:43:54.620 line:82%
-What do you want?
-A camphor packet, please.

835
00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:09.870 line:82%
-How much?
-Ten rupees.

836
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.954 line:82%
I've kept the money here.

837
00:44:57.037 --> 00:44:58.037 line:82%
Dear God…

838
00:45:31.954 --> 00:45:33.162 line:82%
Muthuraj!

839
00:45:34.287 --> 00:45:35.204 line:82%
Sir.

840
00:45:35.537 --> 00:45:36.370 line:82%
Go.

841
00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:42.037 line:82%
Hey, drop that, man.

842
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.787 line:82%
Be careful with it.

843
00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:48.829 line:82%
Go, go.

844
00:45:54.412 --> 00:45:56.204 line:82%
Muthuraj, they're coming out.
Cover all exits.

845
00:45:56.787 --> 00:45:59.870 line:82%
Hey, idiot.
I told you to do it carefully.

846
00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:01.329 line:82%
I was doing it carefully.

847
00:46:01.704 --> 00:46:03.745 line:82%
-But it slipped.
-Park the car and get the tools here.

848
00:46:35.537 --> 00:46:36.745 line:82%
Hey, check there.

849
00:46:37.454 --> 00:46:38.912 line:82%
We need the force here, sir.

850
00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:41.495 line:82%
-Where?
-We got him, sir.

851
00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:43.162 line:82%
Make it fast, sir.

852
00:46:49.454 --> 00:46:50.370 line:82%
Bro…

853
00:46:51.704 --> 00:46:52.745 line:82%
Is this the one that we took?

854
00:46:52.912 --> 00:46:54.287 line:82%
Is this how you’re taking care of it?

855
00:46:58.662 --> 00:47:00.120 line:82%
If it exploded,
we wouldn’t even find a trace.

856
00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.370 line:82%
It would’ve blown up.
Careful, brother.

857
00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:42.120 line:82%
Move aside.

858
00:48:24.579 --> 00:48:27.120 line:82%
-Hey, where are the father and son?
-Sit straight!

859
00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:28.870 line:82%
Look, we don’t have time.

860
00:48:28.954 --> 00:48:30.454 line:82%
Answer us, or go to hell.

861
00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.162 line:82%
Tell us, or we’ll kill you
without a second thought.

862
00:48:32.204 --> 00:48:33.912 line:82%
Will you let me go
if I tell you?

863
00:48:33.954 --> 00:48:35.579 line:82%
Do we look like we’re negotiating?
Answer us!

864
00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.370 line:82%
Sir,
Periyavar
didn't come.

865
00:48:40.537 --> 00:48:42.745 line:82%
Kannan showed up
with a couple of his guys.

866
00:48:43.245 --> 00:48:45.162 line:82%
He got a call about 10 minutes ago.

867
00:48:46.037 --> 00:48:47.579 line:82%
-Then, he left.
-How is it possible, Muthuraj?

868
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:49.079 line:82%
How did the info get out?

869
00:48:49.287 --> 00:48:52.120 line:82%
Thank God,
the inspector tipped us off.

870
00:48:52.412 --> 00:48:55.454 line:82%
-Had we delayed ten more minutes--
-Dad, just listen to me.

871
00:48:55.787 --> 00:48:57.037 line:82%
He won’t stop with this.

872
00:48:57.745 --> 00:49:00.037 line:82%
Call Manickam.
Ask him to come here.

873
00:49:01.162 --> 00:49:02.662 line:82%
Just listen to me, Dad.

874
00:49:03.954 --> 00:49:05.079 line:82%
Just half an hour more.

875
00:49:05.537 --> 00:49:06.454 line:82%
The job will be done.

876
00:49:06.745 --> 00:49:07.787 line:82%
Be patient.

877
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:09.537 line:82%
Yeah, tell me.

878
00:49:10.287 --> 00:49:11.162 line:82%
Alright.

879
00:49:11.412 --> 00:49:13.537 line:82%
Sir, they’re doing checks on
the Thirumangalam bypass road.

880
00:49:15.162 --> 00:49:16.204 line:82%
Take a U-turn.

881
00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.912 line:82%
Brother?
Is this spot okay?

882
00:49:29.954 --> 00:49:31.370 line:82%
What happened to the woman
and her daughter?

883
00:49:31.537 --> 00:49:33.245 line:82%
Brother, she left long back.

884
00:49:33.662 --> 00:49:34.745 line:82%
We have nothing
to do with her.

885
00:49:34.787 --> 00:49:35.870 line:82%
Did you see her leaving?

886
00:49:39.454 --> 00:49:40.870 line:82%
Why would Uncle lie about it?

887
00:49:40.995 --> 00:49:41.912 line:82%
Huh?

888
00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:45.204 line:82%
Work faster.

889
00:49:45.412 --> 00:49:46.370 line:82%
Dig one before I come back.

890
00:50:08.037 --> 00:50:09.954 line:82%
I'll be back in two minutes, brother.

891
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:16.120 line:82%
I left the water bottle in the vehicle.

892
00:50:16.329 --> 00:50:18.454 line:82%
Hey! Keep digging.

893
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.204 line:82%
What?
The SP's vehicle is here.

894
00:50:26.495 --> 00:50:27.329 line:82%
Let's go later.

895
00:50:27.454 --> 00:50:29.620 line:82%
Bro, his vehicle just
passed the cement shop.

896
00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.162 line:82%
Brother, we won't miss this time, right?

897
00:50:35.662 --> 00:50:38.704 line:82%
I’ll wire them together to set it up.

898
00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:42.037 line:82%
If one thing gets triggered,

899
00:50:42.412 --> 00:50:43.912 line:82%
everything will come crashing down.

900
00:50:51.579 --> 00:50:52.579 line:82%
Bro, Uncle's calling.

901
00:50:53.579 --> 00:50:54.537 line:82%
Careful!

902
00:50:55.412 --> 00:50:56.329 line:82%
Yes, brother.

903
00:50:57.079 --> 00:50:58.162 line:82%
Tell me, sir.

904
00:51:02.162 --> 00:51:03.120 line:82%
SP has started.

905
00:51:03.704 --> 00:51:04.745 line:82%
Let's make it fast!

906
00:51:06.579 --> 00:51:07.620 line:82%
Hey!

907
00:51:07.954 --> 00:51:10.829 line:82%
What the…
Get rid of those traces.

908
00:51:11.412 --> 00:51:12.329 line:82%
I'll do it now.

909
00:51:12.745 --> 00:51:13.870 line:82%
Is this how you work?

910
00:51:22.037 --> 00:51:23.704 line:82%
Enough with that.
Come here.

911
00:51:24.745 --> 00:51:25.995 line:82%
Listen. It's--
HEY!

912
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.245 line:82%
No need.

913
00:51:29.287 --> 00:51:31.370 line:82%
Bring the
yam.

914
00:51:32.162 --> 00:51:33.287 line:82%
Yes, brother.

915
00:51:33.412 --> 00:51:34.370 line:82%
Careful.

916
00:51:58.537 --> 00:51:59.870 line:82%
Hey, slow down.

917
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.329 line:82%
I'm going to remove the safety pins.

918
00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:04.579 line:82%
Place it down slowly.

919
00:52:08.204 --> 00:52:09.079 line:82%
Hey…

920
00:52:10.329 --> 00:52:12.245 line:82%
Hey! Keep the
yam
down.

921
00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:13.620 line:82%
He'll be here soon.

922
00:52:14.495 --> 00:52:16.162 line:82%
Hey! Gosh, the
yam!

923
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:18.162 line:82%
Catch it!

924
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:35.079 line:82%
Careful, man.

925
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:36.370 line:82%
Don't touch the pin!

926
00:52:46.495 --> 00:52:47.870 line:82%
This is the spot.

927
00:52:51.412 --> 00:52:52.912 line:82%
He's here, man.

928
00:52:53.204 --> 00:52:54.620 line:82%
Don't touch it.

929
00:52:56.704 --> 00:52:57.620 line:82%
Venkat…

930
00:53:01.537 --> 00:53:03.079 line:82%
Once we get the news,

931
00:53:03.329 --> 00:53:06.662 line:82%
put the barricade on both sides
and secure this place.

932
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:08.704 line:82%
There should be no movement
for 30 minutes.

933
00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.204 line:82%
Venkat…

934
00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:48.829 line:82%
Hello?

935
00:53:49.537 --> 00:53:50.204 line:82%
Tell me.

936
00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.079 line:82%
What the hell?

937
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:54.829 line:82%
He escaped?!

938
00:53:55.787 --> 00:53:56.954 line:82%
He crossed the lakeside?

939
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:59.037 line:82%
Where is he going now?

940
00:54:03.287 --> 00:54:04.287 line:82%
Call Kaali.

941
00:54:18.745 --> 00:54:19.745 line:82%
Slowly.

942
00:54:23.995 --> 00:54:25.079 line:82%
He didn't answer?

943
00:54:25.287 --> 00:54:26.620 line:82%
Super.

944
00:54:26.954 --> 00:54:29.162 line:82%
I knew he would turn his back.

945
00:54:29.954 --> 00:54:31.745 line:82%
Hold it, brother.
We'll figure some alternate.

946
00:54:32.287 --> 00:54:34.620 line:82%
Brother, that SP escaped.

947
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:35.704 line:82%
Do you get that?

948
00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.870 line:82%
Figure something, it seems.
How do we take him out now?

949
00:54:43.704 --> 00:54:46.620 line:82%
Listen to me.
It's not too late.

950
00:54:47.662 --> 00:54:48.870 line:82%
Let's get Manickam.

951
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:50.829 line:82%
Go on.

952
00:54:55.162 --> 00:54:56.912 line:82%
-Hello?
-Kaali?

953
00:54:57.787 --> 00:54:58.912 line:82%
-Kaali!
-Sir?

954
00:54:58.995 --> 00:54:59.870 line:82%
What happened?

955
00:54:59.954 --> 00:55:01.079 line:82%
I couldn't do it, sir.

956
00:55:01.454 --> 00:55:02.412 line:82%
Sorry, sir.

957
00:55:02.912 --> 00:55:05.495 line:82%
I'll take him down at his house.

958
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:07.412 line:82%
How can you say that so easily?

959
00:55:08.162 --> 00:55:10.079 line:82%
-Did he see you?
-No, sir.

960
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.579 line:82%
Hey!
What the hell, man?

961
00:55:13.079 --> 00:55:15.037 line:82%
It's impossible to take him down
near his house.

962
00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:18.162 line:82%
Everything was set, sir.

963
00:55:18.495 --> 00:55:22.829 line:82%
Venkat collapsed
and almost fell on a
yam.

964
00:55:22.995 --> 00:55:25.162 line:82%
You could have just let him die.

965
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.662 line:82%
How could you do this?

966
00:55:27.495 --> 00:55:29.870 line:82%
I told you a gun would’ve been better.

967
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.704 line:82%
But you insisted on
yam.

968
00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:34.079 line:82%
I'm talking to you, but you--
Hey, Kannan. Give it back.

969
00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:36.329 line:82%
-Kaali.
-Tell me.

970
00:55:36.454 --> 00:55:39.495 line:82%
Don't you remember
how you first came to our house?

971
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:43.329 line:82%
You took my dad for granted
because he came looking for you?

972
00:55:43.537 --> 00:55:45.037 line:82%
You forgot everything.

973
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.245 line:82%
-Give me the phone.
-Wait.

974
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.120 line:82%
-If you think you can go without finishing this…
-Hey!

975
00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:50.829 line:82%
-I said give it to me.
-Wait, Dad.

976
00:55:50.954 --> 00:55:52.287 line:82%
Hey, listen carefully.

977
00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.662 line:82%
-I'll take that SP down myself in sometime.
-Tea, sir.

978
00:55:55.954 --> 00:55:57.954 line:82%
-Get lost, you moron!
-We aren't relying on you.

979
00:55:58.162 --> 00:55:59.829 line:82%
But, I won't spare you.

980
00:56:00.162 --> 00:56:02.370 line:82%
Your family is at the festival.

981
00:56:02.912 --> 00:56:05.204 line:82%
I’ll take out every single one of them!

982
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:08.454 line:82%
Kaali… Talk to me!

983
00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.912 line:82%
Tell them to run if they dare.

984
00:56:10.995 --> 00:56:12.745 line:82%
I’ll have their throats slit.

985
00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:15.620 line:82%
Hey! Give it to me.

986
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.162 line:82%
Hey, Kaali.

987
00:56:18.454 --> 00:56:20.079 line:82%
Please don't take his words seriously.

988
00:56:21.037 --> 00:56:22.579 line:82%
You know him.

989
00:56:22.662 --> 00:56:23.537 line:82%
Kaali…

990
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.912 line:82%
I took care of him.

991
00:56:26.079 --> 00:56:28.037 line:82%
You're also like a son to me.
Kaali?

992
00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:31.495 line:82%
Sir. I've given you a word.
I'll keep that up.

993
00:56:31.662 --> 00:56:32.620 line:82%
Alright.

994
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.995 line:82%
Why are you depending on him, Dad?

995
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.079 line:82%
You believe I’m begging him
because I can’t talk?

996
00:56:38.787 --> 00:56:41.537 line:82%
Whoever it may be.
Don’t say you’ll take his family out.

997
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.454 line:82%
Say you’ve already wiped them out.

998
00:56:43.537 --> 00:56:44.454 line:82%
Clear?

999
00:56:45.287 --> 00:56:46.287 line:82%
Alright.

1000
00:56:46.495 --> 00:56:47.495 line:82%
What's the plan now?

1001
00:56:47.912 --> 00:56:50.162 line:82%
I have a place in mind
where we can take down that SP.

1002
00:56:52.912 --> 00:56:54.287 line:82%
Only the guards are here.

1003
00:56:54.787 --> 00:56:56.204 line:82%
Looks like the SP
hasn’t come home.

1004
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:03.745 line:82%
Sir?

1005
00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:07.787 line:82%
Okay, Sir.

1006
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:10.829 line:82%
What is it, brother?

1007
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:13.995 line:82%
He's at the festival.

1008
00:57:15.704 --> 00:57:18.162 line:82%
Shall I turn around and go there?
It's dangerous to stay here.

1009
00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.204 line:82%
-I'm sure they'll tell when he leaves.
-Hey!

1010
00:57:21.579 --> 00:57:23.120 line:82%
Don’t say a word.

1011
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:24.787 line:82%
Sorry, brother.

1012
00:57:37.162 --> 00:57:38.704 line:82%
Hello? Who is it?

1013
00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.537 line:82%
Hey, hold my hand.

1014
00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.162 line:82%
Hey, who are you guys?

1015
00:57:42.204 --> 00:57:43.662 line:82%
-Why are you following us?
-Kalai?

1016
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:46.620 line:82%
-Mom, ask them who they are.
-Who are you guys?

1017
00:57:46.912 --> 00:57:47.954 line:82%
What do you want?

1018
00:58:09.995 --> 00:58:10.912 line:82%
Brother?

1019
00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:12.745 line:82%
Check if anyone's around.

1020
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:18.829 line:82%
What's the plan now?

1021
00:58:21.037 --> 00:58:22.745 line:82%
I'm going to safeguard the
yams.

1022
00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:28.829 line:82%
Stand in the middle of the road.
Only then people will see.

1023
00:58:28.912 --> 00:58:30.037 line:82%
Okay, brother.

1024
00:58:31.162 --> 00:58:32.120 line:82%
Sorry, brother.

1025
00:58:38.162 --> 00:58:39.329 line:82%
Oh, my!

1026
01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.245 line:82%
Sir, let me go.
Leave my hands.

1027
01:01:33.537 --> 01:01:35.037 line:82%
We won't move until the SP comes.

1028
01:01:35.245 --> 01:01:37.745 line:82%
-Hey, get up!
-He is searching for his missing wife and child.

1029
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:40.037 line:82%
Madam.

1030
01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.954 line:82%
I want to see the SP.
My wife and child are missing.

1031
01:01:42.079 --> 01:01:43.454 line:82%
-Madam?
-I signed, trusting him.

1032
01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:47.579 line:82%
Hey.

1033
01:01:48.745 --> 01:01:49.704 line:82%
Come here.

1034
01:01:51.579 --> 01:01:52.454 line:82%
What are you doing there?

1035
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:54.370 line:82%
Nothing, sir.

1036
01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:55.787 line:82%
Where's your house?

1037
01:01:56.662 --> 01:01:58.954 line:82%
It looked like they were fighting.
I was just watching it.

1038
01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:00.454 line:82%
What did I ask you?

1039
01:02:02.245 --> 01:02:03.454 line:82%
My house is nearby.

1040
01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:05.079 line:82%
Where?

1041
01:02:07.204 --> 01:02:08.204 line:82%
What's your name?

1042
01:02:09.662 --> 01:02:10.662 line:82%
Suresh.

1043
01:02:13.995 --> 01:02:14.995 line:82%
What is that?

1044
01:02:15.495 --> 01:02:17.745 line:82%
I fell down, sir.

1045
01:02:19.412 --> 01:02:20.537 line:82%
Give me your phone number.

1046
01:02:22.662 --> 01:02:24.829 line:82%
I don't have it with me.
I left it at home.

1047
01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:32.495 line:82%
Hey, stop!

1048
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:33.662 line:82%
Hey!

1049
01:02:34.745 --> 01:02:37.620 line:82%
-That guy is sitting in front of the house and--
-I know.

1050
01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:39.704 line:82%
You don't talk to him.

1051
01:02:40.287 --> 01:02:42.995 line:82%
-Who's gone home?
-The Inspector said he'll go himself.

1052
01:02:43.495 --> 01:02:45.120 line:82%
We'll go before him.

1053
01:03:00.787 --> 01:03:03.287 line:82%
-I'm on my way home, hang up.
-Hurry up.

1054
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:05.829 line:82%
Hey.

1055
01:03:06.495 --> 01:03:07.454 line:82%
Who the hell is he?

1056
01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:16.995 line:82%
-Stop the car.
-Sir?

1057
01:03:17.329 --> 01:03:18.537 line:82%
-STOP THE DAMN CAR!
-Yes, sir.

1058
01:03:26.704 --> 01:03:28.245 line:82%
Turn on the high beam.

1059
01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.787 line:82%
-Get down and check if he has company.
-Okay, sir.

1060
01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:01.454 line:82%
Hey!

1061
01:04:03.704 --> 01:04:05.329 line:82%
-HEY!
-Sir?

1062
01:04:05.454 --> 01:04:07.162 line:82%
-Stop him there and check him.
-Okay, sir.

1063
01:04:09.287 --> 01:04:10.287 line:82%
Pardon?

1064
01:04:10.537 --> 01:04:12.495 line:82%
-Go and check him, idiot.
-Okay, sir.

1065
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.662 line:82%
Hey, stop there.

1066
01:04:21.162 --> 01:04:22.245 line:82%
-Hey.
-Sir?

1067
01:04:22.329 --> 01:04:23.954 line:82%
-Call for a backup vehicle.
-On it, sir.

1068
01:04:24.579 --> 01:04:26.454 line:82%
Control room, mic 10 driver here.

1069
01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:27.912 line:82%
Copy that.

1070
01:04:28.245 --> 01:04:30.287 line:82%
Please send an inspector
and 4 ARs for immediate backup.

1071
01:04:30.412 --> 01:04:32.454 line:82%
-SP's car is near the junction.
-Backup is on its way.

1072
01:04:32.495 --> 01:04:33.745 line:82%
Sir. He's clear.

1073
01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:36.162 line:82%
You came to tell me this?
Go and stay with him.

1074
01:04:36.287 --> 01:04:38.829 line:82%
He said he wanted to talk
something important to you.

1075
01:04:40.162 --> 01:04:41.995 line:82%
He says he'll talk only to you.

1076
01:04:42.287 --> 01:04:43.829 line:82%
Shall I ask him to come to office?

1077
01:04:49.454 --> 01:04:52.037 line:82%
-When will the backup get here?
-In five minutes, sir.

1078
01:04:53.204 --> 01:04:54.287 line:82%
Did you check him?

1079
01:04:54.412 --> 01:04:56.704 line:82%
The guy seems normal.
He runs a provision store.

1080
01:05:03.412 --> 01:05:05.662 line:82%
-Bring him along with you.
-Okay, sir.

1081
01:05:27.912 --> 01:05:29.454 line:82%
Hello there, Kaali!

1082
01:05:29.787 --> 01:05:30.995 line:82%
How are you?

1083
01:05:33.412 --> 01:05:35.787 line:82%
Why this night meeting?
You could’ve come to the office.

1084
01:05:36.287 --> 01:05:37.870 line:82%
Sir, the team will be here soon.

1085
01:05:38.162 --> 01:05:40.245 line:82%
I know where Kannan is.

1086
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:44.454 line:82%
He has my family.

1087
01:05:45.537 --> 01:05:46.995 line:82%
Save them from him,

1088
01:05:47.287 --> 01:05:48.329 line:82%
and I’ll tell you all the details.

1089
01:05:49.454 --> 01:05:51.704 line:82%
You’ve got a happy family,
and things are going pretty well, right?

1090
01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.579 line:82%
Haven’t you gone through enough?

1091
01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.912 line:82%
Have you forgotten the past?

1092
01:06:02.412 --> 01:06:04.120 line:82%
They asked me to do something
and I refused.

1093
01:06:04.704 --> 01:06:06.829 line:82%
They’re using my family
to threaten me, that’s all.

1094
01:06:07.037 --> 01:06:08.287 line:82%
What did they want you to do?

1095
01:06:09.954 --> 01:06:11.370 line:82%
I'll tell you where Kannan is.

1096
01:06:12.329 --> 01:06:13.579 line:82%
Just keep my name out of it.

1097
01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:16.079 line:82%
What did they want you to do?

1098
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:24.079 line:82%
Kaali…

1099
01:06:34.662 --> 01:06:36.995 line:82%
-Where is he?
-My family?

1100
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.954 line:82%
The police are here to help you.

1101
01:06:45.329 --> 01:06:46.329 line:82%
He is at the festival.

1102
01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:49.245 line:82%
Listen, Kaali.

1103
01:06:50.704 --> 01:06:53.745 line:82%
-If you try to trick me…
-He's near the stage.

1104
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:54.995 line:82%
I just spoke to him.

1105
01:07:00.204 --> 01:07:01.329 line:82%
And Ravi?

1106
01:07:02.204 --> 01:07:03.537 line:82%
They were together.

1107
01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:07.537 line:82%
But not now.

1108
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:10.287 line:82%
Kaali.

1109
01:07:11.537 --> 01:07:13.245 line:82%
If you were in my place,

1110
01:07:13.912 --> 01:07:15.245 line:82%
would you believe
what you just said?

1111
01:07:15.454 --> 01:07:16.370 line:82%
Sir…

1112
01:07:18.579 --> 01:07:19.954 line:82%
My family is there right now.

1113
01:07:20.412 --> 01:07:21.329 line:82%
At the festival.

1114
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:26.579 line:82%
Will you take this risk
if you were in my position?

1115
01:07:30.745 --> 01:07:31.704 line:82%
Sir!

1116
01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.329 line:82%
Stay behind bars till we find Ravi.

1117
01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:38.954 line:82%
-Take him.
-Okay, sir.

1118
01:07:39.162 --> 01:07:42.579 line:82%
If they even suspect I got into your car,
you’ll lose both Kannan and Sir.

1119
01:07:43.287 --> 01:07:44.829 line:82%
Your people are
the ones informing them.

1120
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:46.745 line:82%
HEY!

1121
01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.204 line:82%
-Hey, come here. Sir is calling.
-Go.

1122
01:07:59.912 --> 01:08:01.454 line:82%
Tell me,
what did they ask you to do?

1123
01:08:09.704 --> 01:08:10.537 line:82%
Fine.

1124
01:08:11.245 --> 01:08:12.204 line:82%
From now on,

1125
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:14.662 line:82%
I want you to work for me.

1126
01:08:15.745 --> 01:08:17.495 line:82%
Track down Ravi
and tell me where he is.

1127
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:21.120 line:82%
-I’ll let you know if I find him.
-Find him and report back!

1128
01:08:23.037 --> 01:08:24.079 line:82%
You will.

1129
01:08:25.704 --> 01:08:26.912 line:82%
You have to.

1130
01:08:33.037 --> 01:08:33.995 line:82%
Sir.

1131
01:08:36.287 --> 01:08:37.954 line:82%
I’ve put the past behind me.

1132
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.537 line:82%
But if my family is at risk,

1133
01:08:47.662 --> 01:08:49.287 line:82%
I’ll recall every single detail.

1134
01:08:50.454 --> 01:08:52.245 line:82%
What are you trying to say?
Huh?

1135
01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.287 line:82%
-I’ll find out and let you know.
-Take my number and leave--

1136
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:59.370 line:82%
Kaali!

1137
01:09:07.495 --> 01:09:10.579 line:82%
THAT ONE INCIDENT

1138
01:09:13.412 --> 01:09:16.912 line:82%
A DECADE AGO

1139
01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.662 line:82%
-I have the coconuts ready.
-Okay, okay. Come.

1140
01:09:20.037 --> 01:09:21.454 line:82%
You should have
nine coconuts on the plate.

1141
01:09:21.579 --> 01:09:22.745 line:82%
-Don't change it.
-Okay.

1142
01:09:23.995 --> 01:09:25.370 line:82%
I left the turmeric applied pot at home.

1143
01:09:25.454 --> 01:09:27.287 line:82%
-Can you send someone to get it?
-Sure, sister.

1144
01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:28.162 line:82%
What happened?

1145
01:09:28.454 --> 01:09:30.912 line:82%
Dilip gave the garland
and sugar crystals to me.

1146
01:09:31.037 --> 01:09:32.287 line:82%
Keep it in the groom's room.

1147
01:09:32.329 --> 01:09:33.829 line:82%
-We can take it while going to the temple.
-Okay.

1148
01:09:33.995 --> 01:09:35.454 line:82%
There's not one person.

1149
01:09:35.662 --> 01:09:38.037 line:82%
Dilip has been doing everything
single-handedly from last night.

1150
01:09:38.245 --> 01:09:39.745 line:82%
Don't worry. We'll take care.

1151
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:41.120 line:82%
The best man needs to get ready, too.

1152
01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.037 line:82%
The groom itself isn't ready.

1153
01:09:43.162 --> 01:09:44.329 line:82%
But his best man is.

1154
01:09:44.537 --> 01:09:45.537 line:82%
Check if Kaali is ready.

1155
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.245 line:82%
Can you ask someone
to buy a cello tape, please?

1156
01:09:51.245 --> 01:09:52.287 line:82%
Brother, are you ready?

1157
01:09:53.287 --> 01:09:54.329 line:82%
Mom is looking for you.

1158
01:09:56.745 --> 01:09:57.662 line:82%
Brother?

1159
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:11.329 line:82%
Dilip Brother, where are you?

1160
01:10:11.412 --> 01:10:12.579 line:82%
Did you see Kaali Brother?

1161
01:10:12.662 --> 01:10:15.079 line:82%
-
Isn't he at the venue?
-No, he's not here.

1162
01:10:15.329 --> 01:10:17.745 line:82%
I haven't seen him since morning!

1163
01:10:17.995 --> 01:10:18.995 line:82%
What to do now, brother?

1164
01:10:19.329 --> 01:10:21.412 line:82%
I'll go back home and check.
Handle here until then.

1165
01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.287 line:82%
I passed by his house.
It was locked.

1166
01:10:23.412 --> 01:10:25.037 line:82%
-Then, search the venue thoroughly.
-Venkat!

1167
01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.995 line:82%
I’ll check other places too.
One tea, please.

1168
01:10:28.995 --> 01:10:30.287 line:82%
Venkat!

1169
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:34.454 line:82%
-Is Kaali ready?
-He is getting ready.

1170
01:10:34.662 --> 01:10:36.287 line:82%
You take care of things.
I'll go bring him.

1171
01:10:36.579 --> 01:10:39.287 line:82%
They want a cello tape.
Also buy a garland for the God.

1172
01:10:41.245 --> 01:10:42.245 line:82%
Hey, Kalai.

1173
01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:43.662 line:82%
Get up, Kalai.

1174
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:45.495 line:82%
We need to be at the temple
in half an hour.

1175
01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:46.662 line:82%
Wake up!

1176
01:10:46.995 --> 01:10:48.995 line:82%
Kavitha, has someone gone home?

1177
01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:52.079 line:82%
Hey! What is it?

1178
01:10:52.745 --> 01:10:54.620 line:82%
Nothing. He's taking a shower.

1179
01:10:59.662 --> 01:11:00.704 line:82%
What is it?

1180
01:11:01.704 --> 01:11:02.579 line:82%
Huh?

1181
01:11:04.245 --> 01:11:05.495 line:82%
Brother is not inside.

1182
01:11:06.245 --> 01:11:07.245 line:82%
What do you mean?

1183
01:11:08.912 --> 01:11:12.870 line:82%
Ever since Dilip Brother got up,
Kaali has been missing.

1184
01:11:12.954 --> 01:11:14.079 line:82%
Since morning?

1185
01:11:14.454 --> 01:11:15.287 line:82%
How?

1186
01:11:15.454 --> 01:11:17.620 line:82%
-Guests have started coming!
-Mom.

1187
01:11:17.787 --> 01:11:18.787 line:82%
Don't tell sister-in-law.

1188
01:11:18.995 --> 01:11:21.537 line:82%
-Don’t worry, Dilip will find him.
-You leave.

1189
01:11:23.537 --> 01:11:25.287 line:82%
Kavitha?

1190
01:11:25.412 --> 01:11:27.287 line:82%
-You both take care of things downstairs.
-Brother, we're done for!

1191
01:11:27.495 --> 01:11:28.870 line:82%
She’s about to tell our sister-in-law.

1192
01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:30.454 line:82%
-
Why didn't you handle it?
-What to do?

1193
01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.162 line:82%
Kalai?

1194
01:11:32.745 --> 01:11:33.620 line:82%
Hey!

1195
01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.079 line:82%
Kalai?

1196
01:11:36.412 --> 01:11:37.787 line:82%
What is it, Mom?

1197
01:11:38.162 --> 01:11:40.662 line:82%
Hey, people are searching for Kaali.

1198
01:11:41.454 --> 01:11:42.329 line:82%
What?

1199
01:11:43.454 --> 01:11:44.412 line:82%
He's missing?

1200
01:11:44.995 --> 01:11:46.954 line:82%
Hey, people have started coming.

1201
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.287 line:82%
Hello! Welcome!

1202
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:51.745 line:82%
Kaali is inside, isn't he?

1203
01:11:51.995 --> 01:11:52.912 line:82%
Send him out.

1204
01:11:52.954 --> 01:11:55.412 line:82%
Hey, hey!
Kaali.

1205
01:11:55.704 --> 01:11:57.912 line:82%
Wake up.
Wake up, it's getting late!

1206
01:11:57.995 --> 01:11:58.870 line:82%
-It hurts!
-Mom.

1207
01:11:58.954 --> 01:12:00.454 line:82%
Mom is yelling!
Get up. We have no time left.

1208
01:12:00.829 --> 01:12:02.954 line:82%
You are going to get
an earful from me.

1209
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.579 line:82%
Hey!

1210
01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:07.329 line:82%
-Go! Leave!
-Send him out.

1211
01:12:07.537 --> 01:12:09.079 line:82%
Go on! Leave.

1212
01:12:09.495 --> 01:12:10.662 line:82%
There, there, sweetie.

1213
01:12:11.704 --> 01:12:13.829 line:82%
Hey! Why the heck are you going that way?
Take this way.

1214
01:12:13.954 --> 01:12:14.787 line:82%
Come on!

1215
01:12:16.662 --> 01:12:17.662 line:82%
Faster!

1216
01:12:17.745 --> 01:12:18.870 line:82%
Hand me my shirt.

1217
01:12:18.995 --> 01:12:20.620 line:82%
Oh God, leave, man!

1218
01:12:22.954 --> 01:12:24.162 line:82%
What in the--

1219
01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:28.120 line:82%
All this love now?
Get out of here!

1220
01:12:29.662 --> 01:12:30.870 line:82%
Did you try calling him?

1221
01:12:30.995 --> 01:12:32.912 line:82%
Don't you think I'd have called him?
Kaali's mobile is here.

1222
01:12:33.329 --> 01:12:34.995 line:82%
It's becoming unmanageable.

1223
01:12:35.079 --> 01:12:37.120 line:82%
I understand.
What do we do now?

1224
01:12:37.204 --> 01:12:38.412 line:82%
Where do we look for him?

1225
01:12:38.912 --> 01:12:40.954 line:82%
-Hey! Hello.
- Looking for the groom, eh?

1226
01:12:42.037 --> 01:12:42.995 line:82%
Answer me. Hello!

1227
01:12:43.745 --> 01:12:45.995 line:82%
Hello? What happened?

1228
01:12:46.079 --> 01:12:46.995 line:82%
Hang up.

1229
01:12:51.162 --> 01:12:52.704 line:82%
Mom!

1230
01:12:53.037 --> 01:12:54.787 line:82%
-Yes, even I heard about that.
-Mom!

1231
01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.412 line:82%
-What is it?
-Brother was showering inside.

1232
01:12:58.454 --> 01:13:00.037 line:82%
I didn't check properly.

1233
01:13:02.037 --> 01:13:02.954 line:82%
Okay, leave.

1234
01:13:04.495 --> 01:13:06.204 line:82%
It’s easy for the rich
to afford those stuff.

1235
01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.787 line:82%
Brother,
veshti
and shirt are missing.
I've looked for it all over.

1236
01:13:09.954 --> 01:13:11.162 line:82%
Close the door.

1237
01:13:22.704 --> 01:13:24.704 line:82%
Brother?
Careful!

1238
01:13:24.829 --> 01:13:25.912 line:82%
Get inside, you!

1239
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.162 line:82%
Hey! Close the door.
Someone might come in.

1240
01:13:43.245 --> 01:13:44.787 line:82%
-Kalai…
-Coming!

1241
01:13:45.204 --> 01:13:46.829 line:82%
-Open up.
-Wait.

1242
01:13:46.912 --> 01:13:47.870 line:82%
Are my clothes ready?

1243
01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:49.912 line:82%
-What is it?
-Help me get ready!

1244
01:13:50.162 --> 01:13:52.245 line:82%
Of course!
How long do I need to wait? Come on!

1245
01:13:52.912 --> 01:13:53.995 line:82%
I had to bathe.

1246
01:13:54.245 --> 01:13:55.287 line:82%
Move.

1247
01:13:57.495 --> 01:13:58.412 line:82%
Move.

1248
01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.579 line:82%
Move, woman!

1249
01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:02.954 line:82%
What--

1250
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.745 line:82%
What are you smirking at?
People might see us. Move!

1251
01:14:06.079 --> 01:14:06.912 line:82%
Move, lady!

1252
01:14:08.329 --> 01:14:09.370 line:82%
What are you doing?

1253
01:14:10.329 --> 01:14:11.579 line:82%
Listen, Kalaivaani!

1254
01:14:11.829 --> 01:14:14.079 line:82%
Kalai! Hey!
What are you doing?

1255
01:14:14.454 --> 01:14:15.495 line:82%
Don't you dare!

1256
01:14:16.162 --> 01:14:17.245 line:82%
Stop playing around!

1257
01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:18.787 line:82%
Hey!

1258
01:14:18.995 --> 01:14:19.912 line:82%
I'll--

1259
01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.912 line:82%
Kalai, don't!
Stop it!

1260
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.245 line:82%
My towel…

1261
01:14:23.287 --> 01:14:26.370 line:82%
Gosh! My towel's loose!

1262
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:33.079 line:82%
THE CEREMONY IS IN TEN MINUTES.
GRAB A SNACK AND COME BACK…

1263
01:14:33.287 --> 01:14:34.537 line:82%
Where have you kept it?

1264
01:14:34.954 --> 01:14:36.412 line:82%
Sir and his family are here!

1265
01:14:36.579 --> 01:14:37.537 line:82%
Come on, tell me.

1266
01:14:38.954 --> 01:14:40.454 line:82%
Okay, get me that suitcase.

1267
01:14:45.787 --> 01:14:46.870 line:82%
Is it inside this?

1268
01:14:48.287 --> 01:14:50.120 line:82%
-Huh?
-Open it!

1269
01:14:58.662 --> 01:14:59.912 line:82%
You sly woman!

1270
01:15:01.162 --> 01:15:03.120 line:82%
So, is this why you didn’t
give me my
dhoti
?

1271
01:15:04.245 --> 01:15:06.745 line:82%
-How much is this?
-Why do you need to know?

1272
01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.245 line:82%
This doesn’t look cheap!

1273
01:15:13.245 --> 01:15:15.745 line:82%
Had you told me before,
I’d have gotten you something, too!

1274
01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:17.412 line:82%
As if!

1275
01:15:18.912 --> 01:15:20.579 line:82%
You’ll be wearing a simple saree,

1276
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.287 line:82%
but you want me to glam up?

1277
01:15:23.537 --> 01:15:26.745 line:82%
Come on, this is your first marriage,
not mine!

1278
01:15:31.579 --> 01:15:33.037 line:82%
Okay. I won't say that again.

1279
01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.287 line:82%
I won't!
I promise.

1280
01:15:40.662 --> 01:15:42.537 line:82%
It’s your first marriage as well.

1281
01:15:42.995 --> 01:15:44.120 line:82%
This isn't your kid anymore.

1282
01:15:44.912 --> 01:15:46.204 line:82%
This is
our
kid, got it?

1283
01:15:46.329 --> 01:15:47.954 line:82%
Okay. Our--

1284
01:15:49.037 --> 01:15:50.620 line:82%
This is our kid! Happy?

1285
01:15:55.829 --> 01:15:57.495 line:82%
-Hey, wait.
-Hang on!

1286
01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:00.787 line:82%
Wait!

1287
01:16:03.579 --> 01:16:05.620 line:82%
How many times do
I need to remind you to be gentle?

1288
01:16:06.037 --> 01:16:08.995 line:82%
You bit me so bad,
and now there's a mark!

1289
01:16:11.454 --> 01:16:13.037 line:82%
You had me turned on so bad!

1290
01:16:13.579 --> 01:16:15.870 line:82%
-Huh? What?
-Passion!

1291
01:16:17.579 --> 01:16:19.037 line:82%
Forget it.
Hey, hang on.

1292
01:16:19.579 --> 01:16:22.204 line:82%
-Kalai!
-Yes! Two minutes, Mom!

1293
01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:23.412 line:82%
Come fast!

1294
01:16:24.245 --> 01:16:25.537 line:82%
Hold on.

1295
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:36.454 line:82%
Mom!
I'll be there in ten minutes.

1296
01:16:36.995 --> 01:16:39.204 line:82%
-Yes, Uncle. It's amazing.
-Look! Kaali is here.

1297
01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:40.954 line:82%
-He's here?
-Come, Kalai.

1298
01:16:41.995 --> 01:16:42.912 line:82%
What, Kalai?

1299
01:16:42.995 --> 01:16:44.370 line:82%
Looks like tonight
isn’t going to be your first time.

1300
01:16:44.412 --> 01:16:45.912 line:82%
That was over a year ago!

1301
01:16:46.162 --> 01:16:47.120 line:82%
Oh my!

1302
01:16:47.245 --> 01:16:49.037 line:82%
-There, sweety!
-Kaali, greet everyone.

1303
01:16:51.454 --> 01:16:53.495 line:82%
Hello, brother.
Hi, sister-in-law.

1304
01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:14.870 line:82%
♪ Oh my, oh my! ♪

1305
01:17:15.412 --> 01:17:19.912 line:82%

1310
01:17:32.537 --> 01:17:33.662 line:82%
Where is Dilip?

1311
01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.995 line:82%
-Where on Earth is Dilip?
-Dear, come here.

1312
01:17:37.037 --> 01:17:38.079 line:82%
Hand him the
nuptial thread.

1313
01:17:39.704 --> 01:17:40.995 line:82%
Hello.
DSP sir wanted you--

1314
01:17:41.079 --> 01:17:43.162 line:82%
How dare you touch him?
Who do you think you are?

1315
01:17:43.204 --> 01:17:45.370 line:82%
-Such nerve of you to touch him!
-Hey, Kaali!

1316
01:17:45.454 --> 01:17:47.329 line:82%
-Hey, Kaali, stay here.
-Let go, sir! Let go.

1317
01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:49.579 line:82%
I asked you to bring him,
not to create a scene!

1318
01:17:49.704 --> 01:17:51.412 line:82%
-Kannan, let's focus on this.
-Go on!

1319
01:17:51.495 --> 01:17:52.954 line:82%
Kaali!
Get it started.

1320
01:17:52.995 --> 01:17:55.537 line:82%
I asked you to bring him for a chat.

1321
01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.204 line:82%
-How dare he touch him?
-Take the thread.

1322
01:17:57.245 --> 01:17:58.162 line:82%
Get lost!

1323
01:18:01.662 --> 01:18:03.037 line:82%
Luckily, my shirt didn’t get messed up.

1324
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:10.329 line:82%
-Mom…
-Dear?

1325
01:18:10.412 --> 01:18:11.662 line:82%
He didn’t mean to.

1326
01:18:11.745 --> 01:18:13.829 line:82%
If you stay so serious,
the pictures won’t turn out well!

1327
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:16.870 line:82%
Okay, sorry.

1328
01:18:17.329 --> 01:18:18.745 line:82%
Look, listen to me.

1329
01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:20.370 line:82%
If you ever think
about starting a fight...

1330
01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.912 line:82%
He won't, dear.
You have my word.

1331
01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:24.495 line:82%
-Tie the knot!
-I won't, honey.

1332
01:18:25.037 --> 01:18:25.912 line:82%
Happy?

1333
01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:29.537 line:82%
Come on, smile.

1334
01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.287 line:82%
Go on!
Tie the knot!

1335
01:18:39.912 --> 01:18:41.162 line:82%
Dilip…

1336
01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:43.287 line:82%
-Our
Idiyappam
shop owner's son?
-Yes, Dad.

1337
01:18:43.329 --> 01:18:45.245 line:82%
The one who stays
with Kaali all the time.

1338
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:47.954 line:82%
The postmortem is complete.

1339
01:18:48.329 --> 01:18:50.204 line:82%
But they refuse to take the body.

1340
01:18:50.704 --> 01:18:52.495 line:82%
Only Kaali can settle this.

1341
01:18:53.537 --> 01:18:55.579 line:82%
If we try to deal with this alone,
it'll escalate.

1342
01:18:55.662 --> 01:18:57.329 line:82%
The longer we wait,
the worse it gets.

1343
01:18:57.829 --> 01:19:00.412 line:82%
With your help,
we can keep this under wraps.

1344
01:19:02.079 --> 01:19:03.704 line:82%
Come, Dad.
Let's leave.

1345
01:19:05.495 --> 01:19:06.620 line:82%
What’s in it for us?

1346
01:19:07.537 --> 01:19:08.662 line:82%
What should I do?

1347
01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.787 line:82%
Sir, it’s been a long wait.

1348
01:19:13.204 --> 01:19:15.412 line:82%
Secure that mining contract for us.

1349
01:19:15.537 --> 01:19:17.662 line:82%
I saw this coming, sir.

1350
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.454 line:82%
We don’t need them to fix this.

1351
01:19:21.037 --> 01:19:21.954 line:82%
Come on,
let’s handle it ourselves.

1352
01:19:22.037 --> 01:19:22.870 line:82%
HEY!

1353
01:19:23.495 --> 01:19:24.870 line:82%
Can’t you see I’m talking?

1354
01:19:25.287 --> 01:19:26.704 line:82%
You’re worried about your job?

1355
01:19:27.037 --> 01:19:28.912 line:82%
I’m the one who’s
going to take the fall!

1356
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.079 line:82%
I’m dealing with this mess
because of you.

1357
01:19:32.204 --> 01:19:33.412 line:82%
Sir, you told me to beat him up.

1358
01:19:33.495 --> 01:19:35.620 line:82%
So?
Does that mean you can take his life?

1359
01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.829 line:82%
I’m holding back
because of
Periyavar.

1360
01:19:39.079 --> 01:19:39.995 line:82%
Stay put, I’ll call you!

1361
01:19:44.745 --> 01:19:47.079 line:82%
Wouldn’t
Periyavar
do this for his son-in-law?

1362
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:48.787 line:82%
Huh?

1363
01:19:49.329 --> 01:19:51.829 line:82%
Go on, ask him!
Of course, he'll help you out.

1364
01:19:54.287 --> 01:19:55.287 line:82%
-DSP…
-Sir?

1365
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:57.162 line:82%
My daughter takes more pride

1366
01:19:57.370 --> 01:19:59.537 line:82%
being the Inspector's wife
than being my daughter.

1367
01:19:59.954 --> 01:20:02.662 line:82%
Before that, this mining contract
is of no importance to me.

1368
01:20:03.495 --> 01:20:05.704 line:82%
-Kid, Mom is here!
-Coming, Grandpa.

1369
01:20:05.912 --> 01:20:07.245 line:82%
-Careful!
-Keerthi!

1370
01:20:07.454 --> 01:20:10.579 line:82%
-You’re still up there?
-He’s been after that contract for ages.

1371
01:20:10.954 --> 01:20:12.995 line:82%
-He chose the best time to strike a deal!
-Dad, where is her project?

1372
01:20:13.037 --> 01:20:13.995 line:82%
Yes, I'm coming.

1373
01:20:14.162 --> 01:20:16.162 line:82%
-Getting the job done is our priority.
-Okay…

1374
01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:17.787 line:82%
-Where are the shoes?
-Sister, bring my shoes.

1375
01:20:20.787 --> 01:20:21.995 line:82%
-Dad?
-Yes.

1376
01:20:22.287 --> 01:20:23.704 line:82%
We secured the contract.

1377
01:20:24.079 --> 01:20:25.495 line:82%
We’ve been asking for this for ages.

1378
01:20:25.829 --> 01:20:28.120 line:82%
Now, they’ve signed the deal
to settle their issue.

1379
01:20:28.204 --> 01:20:30.870 line:82%
Dad, did we rush into this?

1380
01:20:32.245 --> 01:20:34.370 line:82%
I think we could’ve
demanded something bigger.

1381
01:20:34.579 --> 01:20:36.579 line:82%
These guys can’t sway Kaali.

1382
01:20:36.995 --> 01:20:37.995 line:82%
We have to talk to him.

1383
01:20:38.454 --> 01:20:41.329 line:82%
It’s not too late.
Over time, the demand will increase.

1384
01:20:42.329 --> 01:20:43.287 line:82%
Don't worry about it.

1385
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.204 line:82%
Switch off your mobile.

1386
01:20:46.829 --> 01:20:47.745 line:82%
I'm hungry.

1387
01:20:48.829 --> 01:20:50.495 line:82%
I’ve sent someone to get us
biryani.

1388
01:20:51.954 --> 01:20:53.329 line:82%
Alright, set an alarm for 3 o’clock.

1389
01:21:00.787 --> 01:21:02.495 line:82%
Brother?
Brother?

1390
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:04.079 line:82%
The DSP is here, brother.

1391
01:21:04.412 --> 01:21:05.537 line:82%
Kannan!

1392
01:21:05.995 --> 01:21:07.162 line:82%
What is this, Kannan?

1393
01:21:07.412 --> 01:21:08.537 line:82%
You still haven’t gotten the job done?

1394
01:21:08.704 --> 01:21:10.037 line:82%
Shush!
He's asleep.

1395
01:21:13.204 --> 01:21:14.120 line:82%
Sit down, sir.

1396
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.370 line:82%
You’ve secured the contract, right?
What now?

1397
01:21:18.454 --> 01:21:19.495 line:82%
One minute.

1398
01:21:25.912 --> 01:21:26.870 line:82%
Sir.

1399
01:21:27.662 --> 01:21:29.037 line:82%
We don't want the contract.

1400
01:21:32.245 --> 01:21:33.954 line:82%
-Now--
-Why the hell didn’t you tell this earlier?

1401
01:21:33.995 --> 01:21:35.745 line:82%
I should have…

1402
01:21:37.204 --> 01:21:38.704 line:82%
But I didn't!

1403
01:21:40.912 --> 01:21:42.329 line:82%
It didn't cross my mind.

1404
01:21:47.037 --> 01:21:49.120 line:82%
We have to act before
Periyavar
learns about this.

1405
01:21:53.495 --> 01:21:55.287 line:82%
-Sir.
-What's happening over there?

1406
01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:57.037 line:82%
Sir …

1407
01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:59.037 line:82%
They betrayed us.

1408
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:00.329 line:82%
It's my fault.

1409
01:22:01.079 --> 01:22:02.370 line:82%
I shouldn't have trusted them.

1410
01:22:02.454 --> 01:22:03.620 line:82%
-Brother.
-Sir?

1411
01:22:04.037 --> 01:22:05.329 line:82%
-Brother.
-Yes, sir.

1412
01:22:05.495 --> 01:22:06.745 line:82%
Can you do it or not?

1413
01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.079 line:82%
Sir,

1414
01:22:08.162 --> 01:22:10.245 line:82%
if the contract was
that important to them,

1415
01:22:10.287 --> 01:22:12.412 line:82%
they wouldn't have waited
so long and rejected it.

1416
01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:15.120 line:82%
They're planning something big.

1417
01:22:15.704 --> 01:22:17.912 line:82%
-I can’t make sense of it.
-Each second we waste,

1418
01:22:17.954 --> 01:22:18.954 line:82%
the news will get out,

1419
01:22:18.995 --> 01:22:21.412 line:82%
I’ll lose my reputation,
and my son-in-law will lose his job.

1420
01:22:21.579 --> 01:22:22.495 line:82%
Sir…

1421
01:22:22.787 --> 01:22:24.370 line:82%
If any one of that happens,

1422
01:22:25.037 --> 01:22:26.454 line:82%
you’ll have to face me!

1423
01:22:26.912 --> 01:22:28.954 line:82%
-Got it?
-I'll deal with this, sir.

1424
01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.162 line:82%
How?

1425
01:22:30.829 --> 01:22:32.829 line:82%
I’ll go as far as falling
at someone’s feet to fix this.

1426
01:22:33.537 --> 01:22:34.579 line:82%
This is my responsibility.

1427
01:22:35.162 --> 01:22:36.204 line:82%
I won't mess up this time.

1428
01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:39.287 line:82%
Man, put the banana leaf for me.

1429
01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:40.537 line:82%
Where is everybody?
Hey!

1430
01:22:40.662 --> 01:22:41.579 line:82%
-Brother?
-Come here.

1431
01:22:42.495 --> 01:22:43.454 line:82%
Where did Dilip go?

1432
01:22:44.829 --> 01:22:46.162 line:82%
He isn't answering my calls.

1433
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:47.704 line:82%
I think he's asleep.

1434
01:22:47.787 --> 01:22:49.745 line:82%
I’ve been asking you
where he is for so long.

1435
01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.579 line:82%
If he’s not picking up,
you should’ve gone to his place, right?

1436
01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.495 line:82%
-Turn the leaf.
-Hey!

1437
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:58.870 line:82%
He hasn’t eaten since morning,
so bring him with you.

1438
01:22:58.912 --> 01:23:00.079 line:82%
He must be hungry.

1439
01:23:00.912 --> 01:23:02.162 line:82%
-Who are you looking for?
-Dilip!

1440
01:23:02.454 --> 01:23:04.037 line:82%
I haven't seen him since morning!

1441
01:23:04.495 --> 01:23:05.537 line:82%
Let him feed you, sister-in-law.

1442
01:23:06.662 --> 01:23:08.662 line:82%
Yes, brother.
Look at the camera.

1443
01:23:09.662 --> 01:23:11.495 line:82%
-Feed me!
-Son…

1444
01:23:13.745 --> 01:23:14.704 line:82%
Kaali…

1445
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:16.412 line:82%
What is it now?

1446
01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.204 line:82%
Wait!

1447
01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:19.370 line:82%
Kaali!

1448
01:23:31.287 --> 01:23:32.495 line:82%
It wasn't intentional.

1449
01:23:35.704 --> 01:23:36.662 line:82%
It was an…

1450
01:23:37.079 --> 01:23:38.079 line:82%
…accident.

1451
01:23:39.912 --> 01:23:41.495 line:82%
We took Dilip…

1452
01:23:42.787 --> 01:23:44.954 line:82%
…to the station for questioning.

1453
01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:46.495 line:82%
Over there, he slipped and fell.

1454
01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:50.537 line:82%
We did everything to save him.

1455
01:23:52.537 --> 01:23:54.037 line:82%
But we couldn’t
save that poor soul.

1456
01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:04.787 line:82%
Kannan and Ravi…

1457
01:24:05.079 --> 01:24:06.245 line:82%
knows about this.

1458
01:24:06.787 --> 01:24:09.537 line:82%
They’ll talk to you about this.

1459
01:24:10.162 --> 01:24:11.120 line:82%
Kaali!

1460
01:24:11.537 --> 01:24:13.204 line:82%
Kaali! Kaali!

1461
01:24:14.287 --> 01:24:15.245 line:82%
-Hey!
-Kaal--

1462
01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.287 line:82%
Who is outside?
Hey!

1463
01:24:18.079 --> 01:24:19.079 line:82%
Open the door.

1464
01:24:20.412 --> 01:24:21.537 line:82%
Venkat?

1465
01:24:22.662 --> 01:24:23.704 line:82%
Hey!

1466
01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.120 line:82%
-Kaali!
-Did you find where Dilip is?

1467
01:24:26.787 --> 01:24:27.870 line:82%
Venkat!

1468
01:24:31.037 --> 01:24:32.912 line:82%
Hey.
Where is your phone?

1469
01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.495 line:82%
-Kaali!
-Call Dilip.

1470
01:24:36.829 --> 01:24:38.495 line:82%
-Kaali, listen to--
-You! What is it?

1471
01:24:38.954 --> 01:24:39.870 line:82%
What?

1472
01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:41.162 line:82%
Kaali.

1473
01:24:41.704 --> 01:24:43.079 line:82%
-Kaali, listen to me.
-Hey!

1474
01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:44.204 line:82%
Open the door.

1475
01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:46.537 line:82%
-Kaali!
-Why did he need to go to the station?

1476
01:24:46.579 --> 01:24:47.704 line:82%
Hey, Venkat!

1477
01:24:48.245 --> 01:24:50.787 line:82%
Why is Uncle stopping me from
talking about Dilip brother?

1478
01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:52.537 line:82%
This doesn't feel good, brother.

1479
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:54.370 line:82%
He has his reasons.

1480
01:24:54.537 --> 01:24:56.037 line:82%
That DSP is here as well.

1481
01:24:56.287 --> 01:24:58.370 line:82%
There’s a wedding going on.
Keep quiet!

1482
01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.537 line:82%
That's why I'm holding back.

1483
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:02.787 line:82%
I don't get it, Kalai.
Why should he--

1484
01:25:04.995 --> 01:25:07.079 line:82%
Hey, tell me the truth.

1485
01:25:08.204 --> 01:25:09.329 line:82%
Is he…

1486
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:12.870 line:82%
alive at the hospital

1487
01:25:13.662 --> 01:25:14.579 line:82%
or...?

1488
01:25:16.329 --> 01:25:17.537 line:82%
Is he dead?

1489
01:25:21.287 --> 01:25:22.329 line:82%
He's no more, Kaali.

1490
01:25:22.412 --> 01:25:23.370 line:82%
Kaali!

1491
01:25:23.704 --> 01:25:25.245 line:82%
-What happened?
-Let go!

1492
01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:26.204 line:82%
What did you do to him?

1493
01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:27.745 line:82%
-Kaali!
-Look here.

1494
01:25:29.037 --> 01:25:31.037 line:82%
I understand he’s mad at me.

1495
01:25:31.287 --> 01:25:32.329 line:82%
But this is wrong!

1496
01:25:32.412 --> 01:25:33.954 line:82%
Hands off!
Let go of him!

1497
01:25:34.412 --> 01:25:36.079 line:82%
We saw him this morning!

1498
01:25:36.495 --> 01:25:38.120 line:82%
And now, you’re saying he’s dead?

1499
01:25:38.329 --> 01:25:40.412 line:82%
Anyone in his place
would react the same!

1500
01:25:40.704 --> 01:25:41.579 line:82%
Sit down.

1501
01:25:41.704 --> 01:25:42.620 line:82%
I understand.

1502
01:25:43.287 --> 01:25:45.870 line:82%
He can't get mad at me
without knowing the full story!

1503
01:25:47.412 --> 01:25:48.329 line:82%
Who killed him?

1504
01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120 line:82%
Why?

1505
01:25:52.745 --> 01:25:55.454 line:82%
Why do you want to know?
What are you planning to do?

1506
01:25:56.412 --> 01:25:57.370 line:82%
Are you going to kill him?

1507
01:25:57.495 --> 01:25:59.037 line:82%
And what about us,
me and the kid?

1508
01:25:59.329 --> 01:26:00.245 line:82%
Kaali!

1509
01:26:02.204 --> 01:26:04.745 line:82%
-Kalai! Kalai?
-You can't go inside, ma'am.

1510
01:26:05.329 --> 01:26:06.495 line:82%
-Dear?
-Wait, she'll be here soon.

1511
01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:07.870 line:82%
My child is hungry.

1512
01:26:07.912 --> 01:26:09.245 line:82%
Don't cry, Kid.

1513
01:26:09.579 --> 01:26:10.662 line:82%
Ram!

1514
01:26:10.829 --> 01:26:11.704 line:82%
-Kalai!
-Ram!

1515
01:26:11.787 --> 01:26:13.620 line:82%
Kalai?

1516
01:26:13.995 --> 01:26:14.954 line:82%
Give her to me.

1517
01:26:15.245 --> 01:26:16.537 line:82%
-It's alright, sweetie.
-What's going on, dear?

1518
01:26:16.829 --> 01:26:19.162 line:82%
-Please don't fight, dear.
-Wait, ma'am.

1519
01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:22.620 line:82%
-Wait outside, ma'am.
-Kaali, please control your temper.

1520
01:26:28.079 --> 01:26:29.120 line:82%
Why are you here now?

1521
01:26:29.412 --> 01:26:30.329 line:82%
What do you want?

1522
01:26:31.704 --> 01:26:34.079 line:82%
Dilip’s family is refusing
to take his body.

1523
01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.912 line:82%
-But if you say, they will.
-Okay.

1524
01:26:37.454 --> 01:26:38.829 line:82%
I need to know what happened.

1525
01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:41.870 line:82%
Hey, why did you say okay to that?

1526
01:26:42.287 --> 01:26:43.204 line:82%
Hey!

1527
01:26:43.662 --> 01:26:44.745 line:82%
Don’t make things worse.

1528
01:26:44.912 --> 01:26:46.120 line:82%
He said okay, didn't he?

1529
01:26:46.245 --> 01:26:49.079 line:82%
God, sir! I’m saying this
for your own good.

1530
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.329 line:82%
His tone doesn’t sound right to me.

1531
01:26:51.704 --> 01:26:53.162 line:82%
Isn't this a little too much?

1532
01:26:53.495 --> 01:26:55.162 line:82%
For my own good?
What do you mean?

1533
01:26:55.745 --> 01:26:56.745 line:82%
Oh God…

1534
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:58.370 line:82%
Kaali!
Hey.

1535
01:26:58.579 --> 01:27:00.204 line:82%
-Please don't.
-What did I do?

1536
01:27:01.537 --> 01:27:02.704 line:82%
He was here all night.

1537
01:27:03.037 --> 01:27:04.245 line:82%
What do you mean he's no more?

1538
01:27:04.829 --> 01:27:05.745 line:82%
Do you believe this?

1539
01:27:07.412 --> 01:27:08.454 line:82%
Hold her.

1540
01:27:08.954 --> 01:27:09.870 line:82%
Tell me.

1541
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:11.287 line:82%
Do you?

1542
01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.120 line:82%
I feel like if I open the door,
I might see him doing something.

1543
01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:26.537 line:82%
Hey!

1544
01:27:28.495 --> 01:27:29.579 line:82%
Dilip!

1545
01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:32.329 line:82%
Hey!

1546
01:27:37.537 --> 01:27:39.370 line:82%
You didn't let us see him.

1547
01:27:40.329 --> 01:27:43.120 line:82%
Since no one was around
to defend him, you killed him ruthlessly.

1548
01:27:45.079 --> 01:27:45.995 line:82%
Okay.

1549
01:27:47.162 --> 01:27:48.579 line:82%
Ask the person behind this
to come here.

1550
01:27:48.745 --> 01:27:50.787 line:82%
-Kaali!
-I need to know what happened.

1551
01:27:51.454 --> 01:27:53.287 line:82%
Kaali, I'm saying this for your own good.

1552
01:27:54.204 --> 01:27:55.870 line:82%
You're up against Inspector Sudhakar.

1553
01:27:56.954 --> 01:27:59.454 line:82%
He is
Periyavar
's son-in-law.
You're aware of that, right?

1554
01:28:00.954 --> 01:28:01.954 line:82%
Kaali!

1555
01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:05.579 line:82%
Sir.

1556
01:28:06.412 --> 01:28:07.287 line:82%
Sir?

1557
01:28:08.579 --> 01:28:10.495 line:82%
DSP spoke with Kaali, it seems.

1558
01:28:12.995 --> 01:28:15.037 line:82%
Sir, it looks like
they might collect Dilip's body.

1559
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:20.245 line:82%
Turn on the phone.

1560
01:28:20.412 --> 01:28:21.495 line:82%
This is the perfect time.

1561
01:28:36.495 --> 01:28:37.495 line:82%
Tell him.

1562
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:40.704 line:82%
He told us
he needed to use the bathroom.

1563
01:28:41.495 --> 01:28:43.704 line:82%
Since it was getting late,
we went to check on him...

1564
01:28:43.995 --> 01:28:46.162 line:82%
-he slipped and--
-I already told him everything.

1565
01:28:46.537 --> 01:28:48.162 line:82%
Tell him what happened
at the tea shop.

1566
01:28:50.829 --> 01:28:52.829 line:82%
After playing shuttlecock,
we went to have some tea.

1567
01:28:55.412 --> 01:28:56.370 line:82%
'We'?

1568
01:28:56.704 --> 01:28:57.745 line:82%
Kaali!

1569
01:28:58.454 --> 01:29:01.287 line:82%
Stop leaving breaks in between,
we’re running out of time!

1570
01:29:01.329 --> 01:29:03.037 line:82%
-Tell him what exactly happened.
-Kaali, enough.

1571
01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:04.245 line:82%
Wait.

1572
01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:06.162 line:82%
Imagine this is a tea shop.
You’re standing here,

1573
01:29:06.204 --> 01:29:07.412 line:82%
and I’m standing here.

1574
01:29:07.662 --> 01:29:09.454 line:82%
-And that guy…
-Dilip.

1575
01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:12.370 line:82%
I'm Dilip.

1576
01:29:13.787 --> 01:29:14.662 line:82%
Tell me.

1577
01:29:19.745 --> 01:29:21.787 line:82%
I grabbed the tea and turned around.
It spilled on him.

1578
01:29:22.704 --> 01:29:24.162 line:82%
He raised his voice
at me in front of everyone.

1579
01:29:25.329 --> 01:29:27.745 line:82%
When Sir asked him to be respectful,

1580
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:28.954 line:82%
he snapped at him in return!

1581
01:29:29.329 --> 01:29:31.454 line:82%
That’s why we dragged him to the station.

1582
01:29:31.495 --> 01:29:32.829 line:82%
If he raised his voice at you…

1583
01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.079 line:82%
You should've yelled at him back.

1584
01:29:36.829 --> 01:29:38.245 line:82%
Why did you lay a hand on him?

1585
01:29:39.662 --> 01:29:40.704 line:82%
Ladies were there.

1586
01:29:41.412 --> 01:29:44.454 line:82%
If you disrespect a cop in public,
won’t I get mad?

1587
01:29:44.495 --> 01:29:45.829 line:82%
How will the public respect me--

1588
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:46.954 line:82%
Hey!

1589
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:53.204 line:82%
Hit me!

1590
01:29:54.329 --> 01:29:55.620 line:82%
There's a lady in here as well.

1591
01:29:59.787 --> 01:30:01.037 line:82%
Touch me if you dare!

1592
01:30:01.162 --> 01:30:02.079 line:82%
Kaali…

1593
01:30:02.245 --> 01:30:04.662 line:82%
I’ll slice you to the core,
you’ll be unrecognizable!

1594
01:30:04.704 --> 01:30:05.704 line:82%
Don't, Kaali.

1595
01:30:06.995 --> 01:30:10.120 line:82%
It’ll take over ten days for your people
to find your bits and pieces

1596
01:30:10.704 --> 01:30:12.829 line:82%
-and get you buried.
-Kaali, don't!

1597
01:30:12.954 --> 01:30:13.954 line:82%
Hey!

1598
01:30:18.454 --> 01:30:19.537 line:82%
Kaali.

1599
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:23.995 line:82%
Come, I'll talk to them.

1600
01:30:26.995 --> 01:30:28.287 line:82%
Don't go there.

1601
01:30:29.787 --> 01:30:31.037 line:82%
Leave it to me.

1602
01:30:31.329 --> 01:30:32.620 line:82%
Just talk to him on the phone.

1603
01:30:37.662 --> 01:30:39.079 line:82%
-Kalai?
-Yes, Mom?

1604
01:30:39.245 --> 01:30:41.245 line:82%
You haven't eaten
anything since morning.

1605
01:30:42.287 --> 01:30:43.579 line:82%
Leave me alone, Mom.

1606
01:30:44.495 --> 01:30:45.995 line:82%
Kaali must be hungry as well.

1607
01:30:46.579 --> 01:30:47.954 line:82%
He'll only eat if you do.

1608
01:30:48.037 --> 01:30:48.954 line:82%
Come.

1609
01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:53.995 line:82%
-Here.
-You just won't listen to me.

1610
01:30:54.454 --> 01:30:56.287 line:82%
-Did you eat?
-I will eat now.

1611
01:30:56.412 --> 01:30:57.829 line:82%
-Eat, you two!
-You go and eat something!

1612
01:30:57.912 --> 01:31:00.079 line:82%
-We'll eat. You have dinner.
-Let Kaali eat first.

1613
01:31:02.329 --> 01:31:03.412 line:82%
Kaali?

1614
01:31:05.495 --> 01:31:06.829 line:82%
Mom, Kaali is missing.

1615
01:31:08.079 --> 01:31:09.370 line:82%
What happened?

1616
01:31:12.287 --> 01:31:14.495 line:82%
Hello?
Kaali?

1617
01:31:16.162 --> 01:31:17.079 line:82%
Where are you?

1618
01:31:18.579 --> 01:31:19.745 line:82%
Kaali?

1619
01:31:20.829 --> 01:31:22.745 line:82%
Saw what they've done to our Dilip?

1620
01:31:25.037 --> 01:31:26.370 line:82%
Where are you now?

1621
01:31:28.079 --> 01:31:29.079 line:82%
Alright.

1622
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:32.120 line:82%
They had me and Kannan hostage.

1623
01:31:32.579 --> 01:31:34.495 line:82%
We managed to get away
and just got out.

1624
01:31:36.579 --> 01:31:38.204 line:82%
Okay.
I'll send someone.

1625
01:31:38.995 --> 01:31:40.995 line:82%
We need to take down
that Inspector at his place!

1626
01:31:47.287 --> 01:31:48.829 line:82%
How many men do we have?

1627
01:31:49.329 --> 01:31:52.204 line:82%
-Hey, bring it soon!
-Yes, tell me.

1628
01:31:55.287 --> 01:31:56.704 line:82%
How can you say that so casually?

1629
01:31:57.287 --> 01:31:58.537 line:82%
What the hell were you doing?

1630
01:32:00.245 --> 01:32:01.829 line:82%
Assign four officers to the wedding hall

1631
01:32:01.912 --> 01:32:04.287 line:82%
and dispatch the others to protect
Periyavar
’s son-in-law.

1632
01:32:07.537 --> 01:32:09.245 line:82%
Hello, son-in-law?

1633
01:32:09.704 --> 01:32:11.412 line:82%
Hang in there,
I’ll take care of it.

1634
01:32:11.662 --> 01:32:14.287 line:82%
I don't feel good about being here.
He’ll come straight here.

1635
01:32:14.454 --> 01:32:15.454 line:82%
That street dog!

1636
01:32:16.204 --> 01:32:17.954 line:82%
If we leave our house fearing
what he might do…

1637
01:32:18.412 --> 01:32:19.412 line:82%
What'll happen?

1638
01:32:20.954 --> 01:32:22.870 line:82%
Don't be scared.
Leave it to me.

1639
01:32:28.954 --> 01:32:30.745 line:82%
Brother, there are about
ten to fifteen guys here.

1640
01:32:31.995 --> 01:32:33.245 line:82%
Hey, stand by the groove.

1641
01:32:33.329 --> 01:32:34.995 line:82%
You go along with them.

1642
01:32:37.079 --> 01:32:38.329 line:82%
Mani!

1643
01:32:41.329 --> 01:32:42.537 line:82%
Ask them to eat first.

1644
01:32:44.704 --> 01:32:45.662 line:82%
Brother, the police are here.

1645
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:47.579 line:82%
If the DSP arrives,
this place will be packed with cops.

1646
01:32:48.037 --> 01:32:50.120 line:82%
If we don't get the job done quickly,
we'll be at risk.

1647
01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.662 line:82%
Who is at the wedding hall?

1648
01:32:52.787 --> 01:32:54.370 line:82%
His whole family is there.

1649
01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.287 line:82%
Send a message saying
we're on our way.

1650
01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:00.204 line:82%
Okay, hang up.
I'll call you back.

1651
01:33:00.704 --> 01:33:02.245 line:82%
Go this way.
Take the back route.

1652
01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:05.204 line:82%
Brother?

1653
01:33:05.495 --> 01:33:07.704 line:82%
Brother,
Periyavar
isn't coming here.

1654
01:33:08.245 --> 01:33:09.412 line:82%
He's heading straight
to the wedding hall.

1655
01:33:13.037 --> 01:33:13.995 line:82%
Sir?

1656
01:33:14.037 --> 01:33:16.454 line:82%
I warned you, even a little scratch
on my son-in-law,

1657
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.537 line:82%
and you’ll have to face me.
Remember?

1658
01:33:19.745 --> 01:33:21.204 line:82%
Sir, we have sent a backup team.

1659
01:33:21.579 --> 01:33:23.204 line:82%
There’s an Inspector
at the scene too.

1660
01:33:23.495 --> 01:33:25.037 line:82%
I'll be there in twenty minutes.

1661
01:33:25.329 --> 01:33:26.329 line:82%
Brother…

1662
01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.704 line:82%
If we make a move
against his son-in-law,

1663
01:33:28.787 --> 01:33:30.162 line:82%
what if he targets our family?

1664
01:33:30.954 --> 01:33:33.579 line:82%
-What should we do?
-Go inside now.

1665
01:33:42.329 --> 01:33:44.662 line:82%
Are you seriously attacking
at an Inspector’s place?

1666
01:33:44.829 --> 01:33:46.204 line:82%
The police force
is on its way for you!

1667
01:33:49.329 --> 01:33:50.245 line:82%
Go in!

1668
01:33:50.912 --> 01:33:53.745 line:82%
-Call Dad!
-Go inside and call him.

1669
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:58.704 line:82%
Brother?
He locked himself inside.

1670
01:33:58.787 --> 01:34:00.662 line:82%
We can't break it open.
Where are you?

1671
01:34:31.454 --> 01:34:34.037 line:82%
Hey, Mani!
Look, take him down.

1672
01:34:34.829 --> 01:34:36.245 line:82%
Brother? Brother?

1673
01:34:36.495 --> 01:34:37.620 line:82%
We took care of the guards outside.

1674
01:34:37.704 --> 01:34:39.287 line:82%
They exploded the door and barged in!

1675
01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:40.537 line:82%
They're trying to break into our room!

1676
01:34:40.662 --> 01:34:42.954 line:82%
Do something, Uncle! Please.
Do something, Uncle!

1677
01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.204 line:82%
Kaali!
Hey, Kaali!

1678
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:47.704 line:82%
Listen, Kaali!
Don't!

1679
01:34:47.829 --> 01:34:49.162 line:82%
I'm telling this for your own good.

1680
01:34:49.954 --> 01:34:51.412 line:82%
Lay a hand on me…

1681
01:34:51.537 --> 01:34:52.870 line:82%
Don't, Kaali.

1682
01:34:53.204 --> 01:34:54.370 line:82%
Listen to me.

1683
01:34:55.245 --> 01:34:56.995 line:82%
Don't, Kaali.

1684
01:34:57.079 --> 01:34:59.870 line:82%
Don't, Kaali.
Your family will be left in ruins.

1685
01:34:59.954 --> 01:35:02.120 line:82%
-Uncle won't spare you.
-Kill him, brother.

1686
01:35:02.287 --> 01:35:03.204 line:82%
Kaali, look!

1687
01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:04.329 line:82%
-Don't!
-Shoot him, brother.

1688
01:35:04.954 --> 01:35:06.287 line:82%
Let’s surrender ourselves.

1689
01:35:06.704 --> 01:35:08.245 line:82%
-Brother?
-
Son-in-law!

1690
01:35:08.579 --> 01:35:09.954 line:82%
Talk to me.

1691
01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.079 line:82%
Uncle…

1692
01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:12.329 line:82%
He left.

1693
01:35:13.412 --> 01:35:14.454 line:82%
What?

1694
01:35:14.829 --> 01:35:16.120 line:82%
They all left.

1695
01:35:16.579 --> 01:35:17.537 line:82%
He left?

1696
01:35:19.662 --> 01:35:20.704 line:82%
What do you mean?

1697
01:35:22.579 --> 01:35:24.454 line:82%
-I don't get it.
-Yes, Uncle.

1698
01:35:24.829 --> 01:35:26.870 line:82%
They're going to surrender themselves.

1699
01:35:26.995 --> 01:35:27.954 line:82%
Surrender?

1700
01:35:28.454 --> 01:35:30.162 line:82%
-Who told you that?
-Uncle…

1701
01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:32.162 line:82%
Kaali said that himself.

1702
01:35:54.912 --> 01:35:55.704 line:82%
Sir--

1703
01:35:56.495 --> 01:35:57.537 line:82%
I'll take care.

1704
01:35:58.495 --> 01:36:00.454 line:82%
Send him with me.

1705
01:36:38.662 --> 01:36:41.454 line:82%
Ram, they are here.
Inform this to sir.

1706
01:37:24.704 --> 01:37:25.745 line:82%
Ask him to come.

1707
01:37:26.745 --> 01:37:27.787 line:82%
-Ram!
-Sir?

1708
01:37:28.454 --> 01:37:29.704 line:82%
You! Come here.

1709
01:37:45.329 --> 01:37:46.412 line:82%
What's inside the bag?

1710
01:37:58.704 --> 01:38:02.079 line:82%
You stray, orphan dog.
Having no one to defend…

1711
01:38:04.454 --> 01:38:06.204 line:82%
If you cross my son-in-law,

1712
01:38:06.287 --> 01:38:07.829 line:82%
you know you'll have
to deal with me, right?

1713
01:38:08.370 --> 01:38:09.370 line:82%
You!

1714
01:38:26.454 --> 01:38:27.829 line:82%
If I lay a hand on you,

1715
01:38:28.245 --> 01:38:29.454 line:82%
who the hell will stop me?

1716
01:38:40.079 --> 01:38:41.037 line:82%
You moron!

1717
01:38:41.787 --> 01:38:43.454 line:82%
Just two inches from ear to forehead

1718
01:38:43.662 --> 01:38:45.037 line:82%
that’s all it takes!

1719
01:38:49.412 --> 01:38:50.620 line:82%
Go!
Get lost.

1720
01:38:52.037 --> 01:38:53.704 line:82%
You made a grave mistake, Kaali!

1721
01:38:54.912 --> 01:38:55.870 line:82%
Don't.

1722
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:58.662 line:82%
I understand your anger.

1723
01:39:00.454 --> 01:39:02.037 line:82%
To avenge Dilip’s death,

1724
01:39:03.079 --> 01:39:04.662 line:82%
you have to start

1725
01:39:05.037 --> 01:39:06.287 line:82%
by killing Ravi and Kannan.

1726
01:39:08.495 --> 01:39:10.870 line:82%
I just got involved to settle this.

1727
01:39:12.454 --> 01:39:16.204 line:82%
They used his death to strike
a mining deal with him.

1728
01:39:16.495 --> 01:39:17.787 line:82%
Now, they’ve used you

1729
01:39:18.245 --> 01:39:19.954 line:82%
and secured
Periyavar
's position too.

1730
01:39:21.912 --> 01:39:24.370 line:82%
They played his death to their benefit!

1731
01:39:24.454 --> 01:39:25.495 line:82%
You’re making that up.

1732
01:39:27.287 --> 01:39:28.870 line:82%
Call them
and tell them to come here.

1733
01:39:29.329 --> 01:39:30.662 line:82%
Let them prove me wrong.

1734
01:39:31.037 --> 01:39:32.412 line:82%
And then,
I'll listen to whatever you say.

1735
01:39:35.287 --> 01:39:37.120 line:82%
Brother, Uncle is on the way.

1736
01:39:38.412 --> 01:39:40.287 line:82%
When did you find out
about Dilip’s death?

1737
01:39:40.787 --> 01:39:41.829 line:82%
Brother.

1738
01:39:43.787 --> 01:39:44.995 line:82%
This morning.

1739
01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:47.162 line:82%
Uncle stopped me from saying
because of the wedding.

1740
01:39:47.245 --> 01:39:48.912 line:82%
He asked me to keep quiet.

1741
01:39:49.204 --> 01:39:50.204 line:82%
That's why…

1742
01:39:51.954 --> 01:39:53.912 line:82%
Brother?
Brother!

1743
01:39:59.079 --> 01:40:00.745 line:82%
-Where the hell is he?
-Hey!

1744
01:40:00.787 --> 01:40:01.995 line:82%
Don't raise your voice in here.

1745
01:40:02.495 --> 01:40:03.745 line:82%
You'll be killed!

1746
01:40:13.537 --> 01:40:15.495 line:82%
-Report it.
-Yes, sir.

1747
01:40:34.454 --> 01:40:35.370 line:82%
Sit down, Dad.

1748
01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:42.162 line:82%
Don't worry, DSP sir.

1749
01:40:43.162 --> 01:40:44.954 line:82%
So, you’re only getting suspended, right?

1750
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.245 line:82%
We'll take care of it.

1751
01:40:46.745 --> 01:40:47.787 line:82%
What say, Dad?

1752
01:40:50.829 --> 01:40:51.787 line:82%
Ravi!

1753
01:40:53.912 --> 01:40:55.454 line:82%
Periyavar
!

1754
01:41:05.787 --> 01:41:07.912 line:82%
-Brother!
-You know what's inside it, right?

1755
01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:09.537 line:82%
-Careful with it.
-Brother?

1756
01:41:09.704 --> 01:41:10.787 line:82%
Careful, guys!

1757
01:41:10.954 --> 01:41:12.245 line:82%
Don't worry, brother.

1758
01:41:12.495 --> 01:41:13.787 line:82%
Instead of you,
I’ll turn myself in.

1759
01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.662 line:82%
Kannan brother said
he’d handle everything else.

1760
01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.579 line:82%
Uncle is everything from now on.

1761
01:41:18.495 --> 01:41:19.454 line:82%
They’re calling you inside.

1762
01:41:26.662 --> 01:41:28.329 line:82%
What should I say to Uncle?

1763
01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.620 line:82%
Tell him I said thanks.

1764
01:41:54.454 --> 01:41:57.287 line:82%
-I asked for a fan, didn't I?
-I got you a balloon, aren't you happy?

1765
01:41:57.412 --> 01:41:59.037 line:82%
But I want a fan!

1766
01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:00.454 line:82%
Keep quiet.

1767
01:42:00.537 --> 01:42:01.870 line:82%
You just can't stop talking, can you?

1768
01:42:06.537 --> 01:42:07.495 line:82%
Hello?

1769
01:42:09.204 --> 01:42:11.704 line:82%
Hello? Kaali?
Is that you?

1770
01:42:13.287 --> 01:42:15.245 line:82%
Why aren't you saying anything?

1771
01:42:15.579 --> 01:42:17.329 line:82%
That is…
I couldn't hear you.

1772
01:42:17.787 --> 01:42:19.620 line:82%
Are you lying to me?
Hello?

1773
01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:21.412 line:82%
It’s really loud here.

1774
01:42:22.079 --> 01:42:23.787 line:82%
Why did you tell us
to come to the festival?

1775
01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:25.495 line:82%
Who was that new guy?

1776
01:42:25.579 --> 01:42:27.245 line:82%
He showed up at our house
to take us with him?

1777
01:42:27.537 --> 01:42:29.037 line:82%
Shall I go home?

1778
01:42:29.204 --> 01:42:30.620 line:82%
Hey, listen.

1779
01:42:31.662 --> 01:42:32.870 line:82%
Stay there until I tell you.

1780
01:42:33.495 --> 01:42:35.454 line:82%
-Hey.
-I'll take you home.

1781
01:42:36.829 --> 01:42:39.412 line:82%
-Don’t leave, no matter who tells you to.
-Hey!

1782
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:41.870 line:82%
What are you saying?
What's going on?

1783
01:42:42.287 --> 01:42:44.079 line:82%
What the hell did you do?
I’m terrified!

1784
01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.120 line:82%
Listen to me.

1785
01:42:45.495 --> 01:42:47.245 line:82%
I didn’t do anything,
and I’m not going to. Clear?

1786
01:42:47.537 --> 01:42:48.537 line:82%
Hey.

1787
01:42:49.245 --> 01:42:50.787 line:82%
-Kaali.
-I won't.

1788
01:42:51.162 --> 01:42:52.412 line:82%
Come to me.

1789
01:42:53.329 --> 01:42:55.370 line:82%
Whatever it is,
let’s face it together.

1790
01:42:55.745 --> 01:42:57.954 line:82%
The kids are looking for you.

1791
01:42:58.954 --> 01:43:00.954 line:82%
Please listen to me, Kaali.

1792
01:43:01.995 --> 01:43:04.537 line:82%
Hey, say something. Please.

1793
01:43:05.370 --> 01:43:08.120 line:82%
Hello?
Can you hear me?

1794
01:43:09.662 --> 01:43:10.537 line:82%
Kaali!

1795
01:43:11.995 --> 01:43:13.287 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1796
01:43:15.954 --> 01:43:17.287 line:82%
I had no other option…

1797
01:43:18.037 --> 01:43:19.204 line:82%
so I left.

1798
01:43:20.579 --> 01:43:22.245 line:82%
Hey… Kaali.

1799
01:43:23.287 --> 01:43:24.579 line:82%
Are you scared?

1800
01:43:25.495 --> 01:43:26.537 line:82%
Don't call me.

1801
01:43:26.954 --> 01:43:27.954 line:82%
I'll call you back.

1802
01:43:28.829 --> 01:43:29.829 line:82%
Hey! Hey!

1803
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.329 line:82%
-Look. Stay there until I call you.
-Kaali! Kaali! One minute.

1804
01:43:56.370 --> 01:43:57.287 line:82%
Gokul?

1805
01:43:57.329 --> 01:43:58.329 line:82%
Wait.

1806
01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.204 line:82%
Let the
molapaari
go.

1807
01:44:13.704 --> 01:44:14.870 line:82%
Go now.

1808
01:44:26.537 --> 01:44:27.495 line:82%
Sir?

1809
01:44:27.537 --> 01:44:29.829 line:82%
Sir!
He's not here.

1810
01:44:35.204 --> 01:44:36.329 line:82%
Stop the vehicle.

1811
01:44:36.537 --> 01:44:38.370 line:82%
We will reach in five minutes, sir.

1812
01:44:38.704 --> 01:44:40.287 line:82%
It’s unsafe to park
in the middle of the road.

1813
01:44:40.329 --> 01:44:41.329 line:82%
Stop here.

1814
01:44:53.245 --> 01:44:54.079 line:82%
Sir.

1815
01:44:54.829 --> 01:44:55.745 line:82%
Sir.

1816
01:44:57.204 --> 01:44:58.829 line:82%
Something doesn't feel right, Ganesan.

1817
01:44:59.412 --> 01:45:01.745 line:82%
Our men are with Kannan, Sir.

1818
01:45:01.829 --> 01:45:03.329 line:82%
Why are you so worried?

1819
01:45:03.704 --> 01:45:04.745 line:82%
Nothing will happen, Sir.

1820
01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:06.995 line:82%
Call them and get an update.

1821
01:45:09.537 --> 01:45:10.704 line:82%
Answer, Kaali!

1822
01:45:21.495 --> 01:45:22.370 line:82%
Sir.

1823
01:45:26.037 --> 01:45:27.037 line:82%
Sir.

1824
01:45:27.495 --> 01:45:29.079 line:82%
I think Kaali fooled us all.

1825
01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.079 line:82%
No trace of him being here.

1826
01:45:33.079 --> 01:45:34.412 line:82%
Sir…Sir.

1827
01:45:40.704 --> 01:45:41.704 line:82%
Hey…

1828
01:45:42.329 --> 01:45:43.829 line:82%
Brother, the police
are causing trouble.

1829
01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:44.995 line:82%
That was a close call.

1830
01:45:45.079 --> 01:45:46.079 line:82%
I almost got caught.

1831
01:45:46.704 --> 01:45:47.620 line:82%
Park the vehicle aside.

1832
01:45:54.745 --> 01:45:56.037 line:82%
Hey! What is it?

1833
01:45:57.454 --> 01:45:58.370 line:82%
Brother?

1834
01:45:59.162 --> 01:46:00.329 line:82%
You didn't hide the
yam
?

1835
01:46:01.287 --> 01:46:02.204 line:82%
I forgot.

1836
01:46:16.079 --> 01:46:17.204 line:82%
-Capture Kaali's family.
-Okay, sir.

1837
01:46:19.537 --> 01:46:20.829 line:82%
-Hey.
-Yes, sir?

1838
01:46:21.704 --> 01:46:22.537 line:82%
One minute.

1839
01:46:31.287 --> 01:46:32.204 line:82%
Sir.

1840
01:46:32.745 --> 01:46:33.662 line:82%
Open it up.

1841
01:46:34.745 --> 01:46:35.912 line:82%
-Go inside.
-Sir.

1842
01:46:36.162 --> 01:46:37.037 line:82%
Go on.

1843
01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:40.579 line:82%
Sir.

1844
01:46:40.745 --> 01:46:42.370 line:82%
They built all this
and were hiding here the entire time.

1845
01:46:42.454 --> 01:46:43.537 line:82%
Chairs are there.

1846
01:46:45.370 --> 01:46:47.079 line:82%
Sir, the information is legit.

1847
01:46:47.829 --> 01:46:49.745 line:82%
Sir, they left in the middle of the meal.

1848
01:47:38.287 --> 01:47:40.079 line:82%
You!
Come out. Come out.

1849
01:47:43.745 --> 01:47:45.162 line:82%
Go!
Stand here.

1850
01:47:45.329 --> 01:47:47.829 line:82%
Hey, come on!
Come out.

1851
01:47:48.954 --> 01:47:49.829 line:82%
Come.

1852
01:47:51.412 --> 01:47:52.537 line:82%
-Get up.
-Sir…

1853
01:47:54.495 --> 01:47:56.954 line:82%
-Sir. let us go!
-Help! Somebody help!

1854
01:47:57.037 --> 01:47:58.662 line:82%
Let me go, sir.
Please.

1855
01:47:59.579 --> 01:48:01.620 line:82%
They are going to kill us,
somebody help!

1856
01:48:06.995 --> 01:48:08.204 line:82%
No one can hear you.

1857
01:48:14.995 --> 01:48:16.329 line:82%
Why is the SP after you?

1858
01:48:16.454 --> 01:48:17.662 line:82%
Are you a big shot?

1859
01:48:17.745 --> 01:48:19.995 line:82%
Why didn't you answer his calls?

1860
01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.787 line:82%
I didn't know whose number it was.

1861
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:23.329 line:82%
That's why I didn't answer.

1862
01:48:23.704 --> 01:48:25.787 line:82%
I need to go home.
Let me go.

1863
01:48:33.162 --> 01:48:34.579 line:82%
Everyone's phones are turned off.

1864
01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:36.704 line:82%
Did Kaali call you, Sir?

1865
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:38.412 line:82%
This is why
I wanted to start early!

1866
01:48:40.329 --> 01:48:42.162 line:82%
None of them are answering my calls.

1867
01:48:43.745 --> 01:48:46.204 line:82%
If Kannan doesn't call
in the next five minutes...

1868
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.662 line:82%
I won't let anyone
involved in this get away.

1869
01:48:49.537 --> 01:48:50.912 line:82%
I’ll take them down along
with their family.

1870
01:48:55.662 --> 01:48:56.620 line:82%
Drive carefully.

1871
01:48:56.954 --> 01:48:57.870 line:82%
Come again?

1872
01:48:58.412 --> 01:48:59.620 line:82%
Did you really just say that?

1873
01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.454 line:82%
I’m so stressed,
not knowing where my son is.

1874
01:49:01.829 --> 01:49:02.745 line:82%
"Drive carefully"?

1875
01:49:04.454 --> 01:49:05.620 line:82%
Drive faster!

1876
01:49:08.787 --> 01:49:09.745 line:82%
Hey…

1877
01:49:11.079 --> 01:49:12.120 line:82%
-Gokul.
-Sir.

1878
01:49:12.829 --> 01:49:14.412 line:82%
Kill him if he screams.

1879
01:49:21.287 --> 01:49:22.412 line:82%
Where is your dad?

1880
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:28.745 line:82%
Hold him tight.

1881
01:49:29.579 --> 01:49:30.870 line:82%
Atleast, you guys tell me.

1882
01:49:33.995 --> 01:49:37.120 line:82%
Look at the guy getting thrashed.
He has an advantage.

1883
01:49:37.579 --> 01:49:40.704 line:82%
If I say they attempted to escape
and that’s why I shot them,

1884
01:49:41.245 --> 01:49:43.495 line:82%
there shouldn't be
any injuries on their bodies.

1885
01:49:43.995 --> 01:49:44.870 line:82%
Don't you agree?

1886
01:49:44.954 --> 01:49:46.412 line:82%
-Hold his leg tight.
-So…

1887
01:49:46.495 --> 01:49:47.912 line:82%
The one getting
thrashed won't get killed.

1888
01:49:48.162 --> 01:49:50.870 line:82%
It's up to you!
Get bashed up or die.

1889
01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.995 line:82%
-I just need the info.
-Sir, I'm ready to get thrashed.

1890
01:49:54.412 --> 01:49:56.537 line:82%
-I can give you his number!
-Gokul!

1891
01:49:56.579 --> 01:49:57.954 line:82%
-We'll trace it down, sir.
-Sir.

1892
01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.620 line:82%
Sir, I will give you
whatever you demand.

1893
01:50:07.745 --> 01:50:08.787 line:82%
Gokul.

1894
01:50:11.329 --> 01:50:12.787 line:82%
What will you get out of revenge?

1895
01:50:13.412 --> 01:50:15.120 line:82%
What do you gain by killing us?

1896
01:50:16.162 --> 01:50:17.454 line:82%
Ask whatever you want.

1897
01:50:17.954 --> 01:50:18.787 line:82%
I'm ready to offer.

1898
01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:20.329 line:82%
Hmm?

1899
01:50:21.370 --> 01:50:22.245 line:82%
Yes, sir.

1900
01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:23.537 line:82%
Whatever it is…

1901
01:50:24.495 --> 01:50:25.329 line:82%
Ask away!

1902
01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:28.204 line:82%
What will you give?

1903
01:50:29.745 --> 01:50:32.079 line:82%
I’ll make sure it’s done by tonight, sir.

1904
01:50:33.412 --> 01:50:34.454 line:82%
What do you want, sir?

1905
01:50:36.245 --> 01:50:37.454 line:82%
I have a family, sir.

1906
01:50:39.329 --> 01:50:40.204 line:82%
Please, sir.

1907
01:50:42.745 --> 01:50:43.829 line:82%
Kannan…

1908
01:50:44.287 --> 01:50:46.579 line:82%
Hope is a dangerous weapon.

1909
01:50:48.037 --> 01:50:49.620 line:82%
For a second,

1910
01:50:49.995 --> 01:50:53.204 line:82%
you pictured a happy future, didn't you?

1911
01:50:56.412 --> 01:50:58.620 line:82%
You want to know what I want?

1912
01:50:59.537 --> 01:51:02.662 line:82%
I want your father.
Will you hand him over?

1913
01:51:06.829 --> 01:51:07.745 line:82%
Alright.

1914
01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:09.537 line:82%
Okay.

1915
01:51:10.829 --> 01:51:11.745 line:82%
Sir.

1916
01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:13.204 line:82%
Sir.

1917
01:51:13.329 --> 01:51:14.620 line:82%
Kaali got caught as well.

1918
01:51:16.037 --> 01:51:17.287 line:82%
But Venkat escaped.

1919
01:51:17.745 --> 01:51:19.329 line:82%
Where should I ask him to come?

1920
01:51:36.579 --> 01:51:37.495 line:82%
Sir.

1921
01:51:41.329 --> 01:51:42.162 line:82%
Sir.

1922
01:51:43.162 --> 01:51:44.787 line:82%
-Sir…
-Kaali.

1923
01:51:45.537 --> 01:51:46.995 line:82%
The info you gave was correct.

1924
01:51:47.495 --> 01:51:48.537 line:82%
We caught Kannan.

1925
01:51:48.745 --> 01:51:49.745 line:82%
He is inside.

1926
01:51:50.495 --> 01:51:51.579 line:82%
Next…

1927
01:51:54.329 --> 01:51:55.329 line:82%
Did you check?

1928
01:51:56.287 --> 01:51:58.454 line:82%
I did, sir.
Shall I cuff him?

1929
01:51:59.412 --> 01:52:02.829 line:82%
-Hey, he’s with us.
-Sir, why did you bring me here?

1930
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:03.870 line:82%
Come, Kaali.

1931
01:52:05.245 --> 01:52:06.037 line:82%
Nothing.

1932
01:52:06.579 --> 01:52:09.329 line:82%
Send a message to Ravi
saying his son’s been caught.

1933
01:52:10.329 --> 01:52:12.245 line:82%
Only then will he come out.

1934
01:52:14.079 --> 01:52:15.454 line:82%
He must have heard
the news by now.

1935
01:52:18.662 --> 01:52:19.912 line:82%
Why did you bring me here?

1936
01:52:22.037 --> 01:52:24.412 line:82%
Kaali, the time is 02:20 now.

1937
01:52:25.745 --> 01:52:29.204 line:82%
There’s nothing we can do
with the clues these guys give.

1938
01:52:29.704 --> 01:52:30.954 line:82%
He’ll be in court by morning.

1939
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:32.662 line:82%
Everything will go in vain.

1940
01:52:33.412 --> 01:52:34.287 line:82%
You do one thing.

1941
01:52:35.037 --> 01:52:35.870 line:82%
Go inside.

1942
01:52:36.245 --> 01:52:37.829 line:82%
Try to get Kannan to talk,

1943
01:52:37.912 --> 01:52:39.912 line:82%
and find out where his father is.
That’s all.

1944
01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:41.829 line:82%
Sir.

1945
01:52:42.912 --> 01:52:44.829 line:82%
Kannan won't trust me.

1946
01:52:46.245 --> 01:52:47.620 line:82%
What do I tell him?

1947
01:52:47.662 --> 01:52:49.037 line:82%
We can't take down just one, Kaali.

1948
01:52:50.079 --> 01:52:51.912 line:82%
The one who stays alive
will pose a threat to us.

1949
01:52:51.954 --> 01:52:52.870 line:82%
Sir?

1950
01:52:53.579 --> 01:52:55.079 line:82%
Don't drag me into this, sir.

1951
01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:57.162 line:82%
I’m not the person I used to be.

1952
01:52:57.537 --> 01:52:58.995 line:82%
Then, what were you doing
near my house?

1953
01:53:00.287 --> 01:53:01.454 line:82%
You didn't answer my calls.

1954
01:53:05.495 --> 01:53:06.579 line:82%
Forget that.

1955
01:53:06.662 --> 01:53:08.037 line:82%
Let's focus on what we need to do.

1956
01:53:09.662 --> 01:53:12.412 line:82%
You go inside.
Things will work out on their own.

1957
01:53:12.787 --> 01:53:15.037 line:82%
He’ll talk to his father
and come up with a plan.

1958
01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.662 line:82%
Just let me know
what’s going on there, that’s it.

1959
01:53:19.079 --> 01:53:20.204 line:82%
I will take care of the rest.

1960
01:53:21.287 --> 01:53:22.495 line:82%
Half the battle is over.

1961
01:53:23.287 --> 01:53:24.745 line:82%
Just finish it once and for all!

1962
01:53:24.912 --> 01:53:26.079 line:82%
Family comes first, right?

1963
01:53:27.495 --> 01:53:28.329 line:82%
Sir…

1964
01:53:49.579 --> 01:53:52.120 line:82%
-Sorry, sir.
-Who'll take me?

1965
01:53:57.454 --> 01:53:58.454 line:82%
Go.

1966
01:54:12.204 --> 01:54:15.662 line:82%
I warned my father
that you’re not trustworthy.

1967
01:54:16.412 --> 01:54:18.370 line:82%
Is this your big plan to kill him?

1968
01:54:19.245 --> 01:54:21.037 line:82%
As if you could pull it off!

1969
01:54:22.329 --> 01:54:23.579 line:82%
Welcome aboard,
let’s die together!

1970
01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.954 line:82%
The call is coming
from Usilampatti towards Madurai.

1971
01:54:26.079 --> 01:54:27.037 line:82%
Super!

1972
01:54:27.245 --> 01:54:28.537 line:82%
The information has been passed on.

1973
01:54:29.245 --> 01:54:30.912 line:82%
Tighten security at the checkpost.

1974
01:54:30.954 --> 01:54:31.912 line:82%
Already done, sir.

1975
01:54:32.162 --> 01:54:34.329 line:82%
They’re bypassing the highway
and taking the route through the villages.

1976
01:54:34.704 --> 01:54:35.787 line:82%
That's expected.

1977
01:54:36.079 --> 01:54:40.120 line:82%
Send our men their way.
Don’t trust anyone at L&O.

1978
01:54:40.162 --> 01:54:41.079 line:82%
Okay, sir.

1979
01:54:42.454 --> 01:54:43.329 line:82%
Be careful.

1980
01:54:44.662 --> 01:54:47.079 line:82%
The current plan is on track.

1981
01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.454 line:82%
I will end it today.
The game ends today!

1982
01:54:54.704 --> 01:54:57.245 line:82%
What is it?
Are you guys plotting something?

1983
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:59.954 line:82%
Police are watching you closely.

1984
01:55:01.579 --> 01:55:02.870 line:82%
Do I need to break it down
just for you?

1985
01:55:03.204 --> 01:55:04.912 line:82%
Sit down.
Hey!

1986
01:55:05.079 --> 01:55:07.995 line:82%
-Trying to untie yourself? Stay put.
-No, sir.

1987
01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:10.787 line:82%
Listen. I'll be back.

1988
01:55:10.954 --> 01:55:11.787 line:82%
Got it.

1989
01:55:12.454 --> 01:55:13.454 line:82%
What are you doing?

1990
01:55:15.329 --> 01:55:16.662 line:82%
Kaali!
What are you up to?

1991
01:55:18.537 --> 01:55:19.495 line:82%
What on earth are you doing?

1992
01:55:21.912 --> 01:55:23.162 line:82%
Who are you calling?

1993
01:55:23.745 --> 01:55:25.037 line:82%
I have a family, remember?

1994
01:55:25.204 --> 01:55:26.454 line:82%
Who are you calling to?
Give me the phone!

1995
01:55:30.412 --> 01:55:31.495 line:82%
Make it quick.

1996
01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:40.329 line:82%
If we make a call,
we're done for.

1997
01:55:41.495 --> 01:55:43.495 line:82%
Brother, please.

1998
01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.412 line:82%
Ask our men to come.

1999
01:55:45.537 --> 01:55:47.787 line:82%
-They might be back soon.
-What are you thinking, brother?

2000
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:49.537 line:82%
Inform Sir that the police are here.

2001
01:55:49.662 --> 01:55:51.120 line:82%
Police are already
on their way to him.

2002
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:53.829 line:82%
At least inform him!

2003
01:55:54.662 --> 01:55:55.995 line:82%
He might get caught for godsake!

2004
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:57.287 line:82%
Hey!

2005
01:55:57.495 --> 01:55:59.662 line:82%
You know what'll happen
if he doesn't get caught, don't you?

2006
01:56:00.329 --> 01:56:01.954 line:82%
SP won’t spare me,

2007
01:56:02.704 --> 01:56:04.954 line:82%
because the one left alive
will always be a threat.

2008
01:56:05.412 --> 01:56:06.370 line:82%
You're here as well.

2009
01:56:06.829 --> 01:56:08.537 line:82%
My father’s not letting his guard down.

2010
01:56:09.370 --> 01:56:10.787 line:82%
He won't get caught.

2011
01:56:11.787 --> 01:56:14.662 line:82%
Even if he gets caught,
let it not be because of me.

2012
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:15.829 line:82%
I won't make a call.

2013
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:18.037 line:82%
Brother, please do something
before they return.

2014
01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.620 line:82%
-Please, brother.
-Hey! Hey!

2015
01:56:20.579 --> 01:56:21.579 line:82%
Give me the phone.

2016
01:56:22.204 --> 01:56:23.954 line:82%
Brother, please.
Listen to us.

2017
01:56:24.037 --> 01:56:25.829 line:82%
I came trusting you, but now
my family's fate is uncertain.

2018
01:56:25.870 --> 01:56:27.870 line:82%
And you're just rambling.
Give me the phone!

2019
01:56:28.662 --> 01:56:29.495 line:82%
Brother…

2020
01:56:29.579 --> 01:56:31.912 line:82%
Brother please,
at least ask our men to come!

2021
01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.745 line:82%
-We'll escape from here.
-Shut up, guys!

2022
01:56:41.245 --> 01:56:42.829 line:82%
Dial this number.

2023
01:56:43.787 --> 01:56:45.412 line:82%
70922…

2024
01:56:46.162 --> 01:56:47.579 line:82%
16415.

2025
01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.120 line:82%
Put it on speaker.

2026
01:56:53.329 --> 01:56:55.995 line:82%
Hello?
Hello?

2027
01:56:56.912 --> 01:56:59.370 line:82%
-Mom?
-Kannan, son?

2028
01:56:59.537 --> 01:57:01.162 line:82%
-Kanna, where are you?
-Mom!

2029
01:57:01.787 --> 01:57:03.579 line:82%
I wanted to hear your voice
one last time.

2030
01:57:03.662 --> 01:57:04.829 line:82%
Don't talk like that.

2031
01:57:05.037 --> 01:57:06.954 line:82%
Where are you?
Tell me that.

2032
01:57:07.412 --> 01:57:09.037 line:82%
I'm worried sick.

2033
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.495 line:82%
Son, wait.
I'll call your dad.

2034
01:57:11.579 --> 01:57:13.245 line:82%
No, Mom.
Police are tracing his number.

2035
01:57:13.329 --> 01:57:16.162 line:82%
Hey, they can't track down
your father.

2036
01:57:16.204 --> 01:57:17.787 line:82%
Don't worry.
We'll take care.

2037
01:57:18.079 --> 01:57:22.537 line:82%
Doesn't matter what happens,
even if it costs an eye or limb,

2038
01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:25.037 line:82%
just make sure you come back alive.
I'll protect you.

2039
01:57:25.079 --> 01:57:28.954 line:82%
Got it?
Things will unfold in our favor.

2040
01:57:29.245 --> 01:57:31.454 line:82%
-
Did you hear me?
-Yes, Mom.

2041
01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:32.704 line:82%
-Son?
-Mom!

2042
01:57:33.245 --> 01:57:35.245 line:82%
There's a black sheep in your gang.

2043
01:57:35.495 --> 01:57:36.537 line:82%
Trust no one.

2044
01:57:36.787 --> 01:57:39.579 line:82%
Stay alert.
I'll hang up now.

2045
01:57:45.245 --> 01:57:47.079 line:82%
-Who was it?
-It wasn't me, brother.

2046
01:57:48.370 --> 01:57:50.620 line:82%
The SP walked right into my hideout,

2047
01:57:50.704 --> 01:57:52.037 line:82%
lifted the screen,
and found me there.

2048
01:57:52.412 --> 01:57:54.079 line:82%
-How could this happen?
-I don't know.

2049
01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:55.579 line:82%
How could this happen?!

2050
01:57:56.579 --> 01:57:57.829 line:82%
Why on earth would we do this?

2051
01:57:57.954 --> 01:58:00.037 line:82%
'We'? So you’re all part of this?

2052
01:58:00.412 --> 01:58:01.954 line:82%
Weren't we by your side?

2053
01:58:02.412 --> 01:58:03.412 line:82%
That’s all I meant.

2054
01:58:03.704 --> 01:58:05.829 line:82%
How could you think we’d…

2055
01:58:06.454 --> 01:58:07.995 line:82%
-Despite being thrashed black and blue…
-Hey!

2056
01:58:08.037 --> 01:58:09.829 line:82%
What are you implying?

2057
01:58:09.912 --> 01:58:11.412 line:82%
Are you pointing fingers at me?

2058
01:58:11.662 --> 01:58:12.620 line:82%
I'll kill you!

2059
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:14.329 line:82%
Brother, how could we?

2060
01:58:14.662 --> 01:58:17.704 line:82%
-Wasn't Kaali there too, besides us?
-Hey!

2061
01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:20.245 line:82%
Chidambaram, mind it!

2062
01:58:22.829 --> 01:58:24.454 line:82%
It could even be Kaali.

2063
01:58:24.579 --> 01:58:27.037 line:82%
You filthy traitors!
He had no idea where I was!

2064
01:58:27.162 --> 01:58:28.829 line:82%
I’ll kill all three of you!

2065
01:58:29.037 --> 01:58:30.995 line:82%
-Spit out the truth, now!
-It wasn’t us!

2066
01:58:31.079 --> 01:58:32.537 line:82%
I swear it wasn't us.

2067
01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:34.620 line:82%
-How could you suspect us?
-Hey!

2068
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:36.954 line:82%
Even if I don’t, my dad will…

2069
01:58:37.037 --> 01:58:39.579 line:82%
-kill all three of you.
-Hey! Shh…

2070
01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.079 line:82%
Silence, now.

2071
01:58:44.787 --> 01:58:47.454 line:82%
-Let's get him.
-Follow me.

2072
01:58:49.912 --> 01:58:51.870 line:82%
Brother, it's our men.

2073
01:58:54.204 --> 01:58:55.454 line:82%
Get down. Run.

2074
01:58:56.912 --> 01:58:57.829 line:82%
They're here.

2075
01:58:57.995 --> 01:58:58.870 line:82%
It's our men, guys!

2076
01:59:00.704 --> 01:59:01.787 line:82%
They're here.

2077
01:59:01.912 --> 01:59:03.162 line:82%
It’s our men.

2078
01:59:03.495 --> 01:59:06.037 line:82%
-Our men are here!
-Hey, ask Muthuraj to come.

2079
01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:08.870 line:82%
Hey, the SP is here.
I knew it!

2080
01:59:08.954 --> 01:59:10.620 line:82%
Sir, their men are here.

2081
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:13.829 line:82%
Take him down!

2082
01:59:21.954 --> 01:59:22.912 line:82%
Brother…

2083
01:59:26.745 --> 01:59:29.370 line:82%
Brother, our men have surrounded the place!
Don't worry.

2084
01:59:29.579 --> 01:59:32.579 line:82%
-We're here.
-Don’t let anyone live.

2085
01:59:32.704 --> 01:59:33.912 line:82%
Take down that SP!

2086
01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:36.620 line:82%
I have a clear shot at him.

2087
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:40.620 line:82%
Brother, I shot the SP.

2088
01:59:40.912 --> 01:59:42.829 line:82%
I've shot him.
I'm coming.

2089
01:59:42.995 --> 01:59:44.162 line:82%
Brother, the SP's going that way.

2090
01:59:44.329 --> 01:59:46.079 line:82%
-Sir, let's go.
-Move fast!

2091
01:59:49.245 --> 01:59:50.829 line:82%
-Break the door.
-Move.

2092
01:59:55.662 --> 01:59:57.954 line:82%
-Don't untie anyone!
-Kannan brother…

2093
01:59:57.995 --> 01:59:58.912 line:82%
I'm here for you.

2094
01:59:58.995 --> 02:00:01.037 line:82%
Who set off the bomb?
He is still inside. Get out!

2095
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:02.370 line:82%
Don't worry.

2096
02:00:02.537 --> 02:00:04.579 line:82%
Saw Kannan Brother.
He's safe, Uncle.

2097
02:00:04.829 --> 02:00:07.079 line:82%
-Yeah, hand the phone to Kannan.
-Brother…

2098
02:00:07.245 --> 02:00:09.787 line:82%
It's alright.
We're here now.

2099
02:00:10.037 --> 02:00:12.162 line:82%
-Kannan, come home.
-I'll be there, dad.

2100
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:15.370 line:82%
-Where is the SP?
-I shot him.

2101
02:00:15.454 --> 02:00:18.120 line:82%
-He escaped, brother.
-You idiots, find that SP!

2102
02:00:18.245 --> 02:00:20.037 line:82%
Please don't!

2103
02:00:24.204 --> 02:00:26.245 line:82%
-You traitors!
-Please don't, brother.

2104
02:00:26.370 --> 02:00:28.287 line:82%
I have a family.
Please let me go!

2105
02:00:28.412 --> 02:00:31.662 line:82%
-I have a family. Listen to me!
-You've fed off me for years.

2106
02:00:31.954 --> 02:00:33.662 line:82%
Let's go kill that SP.

2107
02:00:36.704 --> 02:00:37.662 line:82%
Go find him.

2108
02:00:37.912 --> 02:00:40.995 line:82%
Kaali! Do I need to invite you?
Come on, let’s get moving!

2109
02:00:43.454 --> 02:00:44.912 line:82%
Hey, search every nook and cranny.

2110
02:00:45.037 --> 02:00:46.620 line:82%
Find the SP.

2111
02:00:46.704 --> 02:00:47.829 line:82%
You get going, brother.

2112
02:00:48.037 --> 02:00:49.370 line:82%
Uncle wanted you home.
I’ve got this, you go.

2113
02:00:49.495 --> 02:00:51.995 line:82%
-I won’t leave until I have that SP.
-Brother…

2114
02:00:52.079 --> 02:00:54.579 line:82%
Kaali, at least kill him now!

2115
02:00:54.704 --> 02:00:55.912 line:82%
If you can, catch him alive.

2116
02:00:55.995 --> 02:00:58.204 line:82%
-Spare none of the police!
-Kannan…

2117
02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:01.120 line:82%
Do whatever you want,
but why drag me into this?

2118
02:01:01.662 --> 02:01:04.037 line:82%
Hey, you're halfway there.

2119
02:01:04.454 --> 02:01:06.079 line:82%
Finish it completely and leave!

2120
02:01:09.412 --> 02:01:10.870 line:82%
Hey, take this.

2121
02:01:12.370 --> 02:01:14.870 line:82%
-Take this, I said.
-Kaali…

2122
02:01:16.162 --> 02:01:17.454 line:82%
Remember your family?

2123
02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:18.745 line:82%
The police are here!

2124
02:01:19.412 --> 02:01:21.579 line:82%
Brother, all the cops are here.
Come quick!

2125
02:01:21.662 --> 02:01:22.620 line:82%
Let's go.

2126
02:01:41.204 --> 02:01:43.120 line:82%
-Hand it over!
-Get him.

2127
02:01:43.287 --> 02:01:44.579 line:82%
Don't let any police escape.

2128
02:01:44.787 --> 02:01:46.662 line:82%
Brother, the inspector's here.

2129
02:01:47.037 --> 02:01:49.204 line:82%
Kaali, catch him.

2130
02:01:57.412 --> 02:01:59.620 line:82%
-Hey, shoot him.
-Brother, come with me.

2131
02:02:04.329 --> 02:02:06.329 line:82%
Don't move.
Stay right there.

2132
02:02:43.662 --> 02:02:45.995 line:82%
-Check if someone’s there.
-Okay, brother.

2133
02:02:46.037 --> 02:02:46.870 line:82%
He's dead.

2134
02:02:49.745 --> 02:02:51.870 line:82%
Kaali, wait.
I'm coming.

2135
02:02:51.995 --> 02:02:53.829 line:82%
There's nothing over here.
You check over there.

2136
02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:55.162 line:82%
-Kannan?
-What?

2137
02:02:55.287 --> 02:02:56.204 line:82%
I’m counting on you.

2138
02:02:56.287 --> 02:02:58.162 line:82%
You catch him first.

2139
02:03:15.037 --> 02:03:16.079 line:82%
-Kaali…
-Sir?

2140
02:03:16.454 --> 02:03:18.079 line:82%
Divert them fast and…

2141
02:03:18.245 --> 02:03:20.287 line:82%
-help me get to my car.
-They've surrounded the place.

2142
02:03:20.370 --> 02:03:22.162 line:82%
-We can't move.
-Listen, Kaali.

2143
02:03:22.745 --> 02:03:24.204 line:82%
The force could arrive any moment.

2144
02:03:24.537 --> 02:03:25.745 line:82%
If I die…

2145
02:03:26.079 --> 02:03:27.704 line:82%
your name's next on the list.

2146
02:03:28.287 --> 02:03:30.537 line:82%
Don't you know what'll happen
if an SP dies?

2147
02:03:30.954 --> 02:03:34.829 line:82%
Only I can help you escape.

2148
02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:37.412 line:82%
Distract them quickly

2149
02:03:37.537 --> 02:03:38.829 line:82%
-and take me--
-Shh!

2150
02:03:44.204 --> 02:03:46.454 line:82%
I warned you
not to drag me into this,

2151
02:03:47.079 --> 02:03:48.329 line:82%
but you didn’t listen.

2152
02:03:56.579 --> 02:03:57.579 line:82%
Come on.

2153
02:04:06.579 --> 02:04:08.329 line:82%
Sir, careful.

2154
02:04:14.995 --> 02:04:16.204 line:82%
Quick!
Make it fast.

2155
02:04:18.537 --> 02:04:19.412 line:82%
Come on, quick!

2156
02:04:25.454 --> 02:04:27.662 line:82%
Come on, man.
Drive.

2157
02:04:27.829 --> 02:04:31.495 line:82%
-Kaali, don't spare them.
-What do you mean?

2158
02:04:31.704 --> 02:04:33.829 line:82%
I can only distract them.

2159
02:04:33.954 --> 02:04:34.912 line:82%
Start the car.

2160
02:04:36.829 --> 02:04:38.245 line:82%
Kaali, take the phone.

2161
02:04:39.412 --> 02:04:40.412 line:82%
Sir…

2162
02:04:47.287 --> 02:04:49.787 line:82%
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Our tires are slashed.

2163
02:04:49.912 --> 02:04:51.829 line:82%
-That's alright. Just move.
-Where are you guys?

2164
02:04:52.329 --> 02:04:54.870 line:82%
-The car isn't starting, sir.
-Somebody come fast!

2165
02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:05.954 line:82%
Get out of here.

2166
02:05:21.787 --> 02:05:23.370 line:82%
Hey, go now!

2167
02:05:26.037 --> 02:05:28.412 line:82%
Hey, look.
The SP is trying to escape.

2168
02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:39.870 line:82%
The SP's car is leaving.
Get him!

2169
02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:50.454 line:82%
-Come on, fast.
-Hey, Kaali! Come!

2170
02:05:50.745 --> 02:05:52.120 line:82%
It's the SP's car.

2171
02:05:58.662 --> 02:05:59.954 line:82%
-Is that him?
-Hey, Venkat!

2172
02:06:00.662 --> 02:06:01.995 line:82%
-Come on, brother.
-Give me your phone.

2173
02:06:02.662 --> 02:06:04.037 line:82%
-Airtel, right?
-Yeah.

2174
02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:08.329 line:82%
Gosh, I can't reach them.

2175
02:06:09.287 --> 02:06:11.745 line:82%
Go give my wife the phone.
I need to talk to her.

2176
02:06:12.162 --> 02:06:14.954 line:82%
She went to the festival,
but she’s called me like a dozen times.

2177
02:06:15.162 --> 02:06:16.829 line:82%
-Go.
-To this number?

2178
02:06:17.579 --> 02:06:18.579 line:82%
Just go.

2179
02:06:19.245 --> 02:06:20.995 line:82%
But Uncle wanted me to
stay by Kannan's side.

2180
02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:22.120 line:82%
You go, brother.
I'll take care.

2181
02:06:22.204 --> 02:06:23.995 line:82%
It's all good here.
What the hell's your problem?

2182
02:06:24.245 --> 02:06:25.287 line:82%
Go to her.
Also…

2183
02:06:25.412 --> 02:06:27.162 line:82%
get her to call me
or ask her to go home.

2184
02:06:27.954 --> 02:06:29.995 line:82%
Can I tell Kannan brother
that I'm leaving?

2185
02:06:30.495 --> 02:06:31.662 line:82%
I said go!

2186
02:06:37.787 --> 02:06:39.120 line:82%
Hey, Kaali. Come here.

2187
02:06:39.704 --> 02:06:41.037 line:82%
He's underneath the car.

2188
02:06:41.454 --> 02:06:42.454 line:82%
Somebody get him!

2189
02:06:47.662 --> 02:06:48.745 line:82%
Lift him up.

2190
02:06:48.995 --> 02:06:50.662 line:82%
-Head first.
-Lift him up.

2191
02:06:52.037 --> 02:06:53.204 line:82%
Hold him.

2192
02:06:54.454 --> 02:06:56.995 line:82%
Trying to escape, eh?
Lift him.

2193
02:06:57.620 --> 02:06:58.745 line:82%
Come on.

2194
02:06:59.412 --> 02:07:00.412 line:82%
That's enough.

2195
02:07:01.829 --> 02:07:05.245 line:82%
"Hope is a dangerous weapon!"
Huh?

2196
02:07:05.662 --> 02:07:06.662 line:82%
Stop this, Kannan.

2197
02:07:06.829 --> 02:07:08.912 line:82%
Let me go.
You are making a mistake.

2198
02:07:09.287 --> 02:07:12.370 line:82%
I asked you the same thing earlier.

2199
02:07:12.995 --> 02:07:14.245 line:82%
I'll show you who I am.

2200
02:07:14.495 --> 02:07:15.454 line:82%
Kaali, come here.

2201
02:07:15.537 --> 02:07:17.204 line:82%
Load this guy in the vehicle.

2202
02:07:17.329 --> 02:07:19.829 line:82%
Why are you carrying him?
Put him down.

2203
02:07:19.954 --> 02:07:22.620 line:82%
We need him alive
to negotiate with the police.

2204
02:07:22.704 --> 02:07:25.537 line:82%
If we leave him here,
we'll be dead.

2205
02:07:26.037 --> 02:07:27.454 line:82%
-Come on.
-Put him inside.

2206
02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:29.245 line:82%
I'll take care of everything.

2207
02:07:29.412 --> 02:07:31.787 line:82%
Keep him from losing blood,
he might die.

2208
02:07:42.579 --> 02:07:44.079 line:82%
Bring the car over.

2209
02:07:44.204 --> 02:07:45.204 line:82%
-Come on.
-Bring the car.

2210
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:47.537 line:82%
Come on.
Kaali, get in the jeep.

2211
02:07:48.370 --> 02:07:49.287 line:82%
Come on.

2212
02:07:49.662 --> 02:07:50.704 line:82%
Get in.

2213
02:07:54.495 --> 02:07:55.495 line:82%
Drive.

2214
02:07:56.787 --> 02:07:57.620 line:82%
Gautham!

2215
02:07:57.704 --> 02:07:58.662 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Get in.

2216
02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:07.662 line:82%
-Hello?
-Hey.

2217
02:08:07.787 --> 02:08:09.037 line:82%
-Yes, Sir.
-Pass the phone to Kannan.

2218
02:08:09.704 --> 02:08:10.662 line:82%
Brother, call for you.

2219
02:08:11.912 --> 02:08:13.287 line:82%
-Dad?
-Kannan, what happened?

2220
02:08:13.495 --> 02:08:16.120 line:82%
-We've started, Dad.
-Come straight to

2221
02:08:16.287 --> 02:08:17.370 line:82%
-Manickam's godown.
-Fine, dad.

2222
02:08:17.704 --> 02:08:18.620 line:82%
Where is SP?

2223
02:08:19.079 --> 02:08:20.454 line:82%
He's in the car with us.

2224
02:08:20.704 --> 02:08:21.870 line:82%
Alright! Stay safe.

2225
02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:23.162 line:82%
Are all our men safe?

2226
02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:26.037 line:82%
I killed those traitor dogs
who were with me.

2227
02:08:26.204 --> 02:08:27.537 line:82%
Why did you?

2228
02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:28.829 line:82%
Hand the phone to Kaali.

2229
02:08:29.037 --> 02:08:30.120 line:82%
Alright.
Kaali…

2230
02:08:33.454 --> 02:08:34.454 line:82%
-Sir?
-Kaali…

2231
02:08:34.704 --> 02:08:35.495 line:82%
You leave.

2232
02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:36.954 line:82%
-I'll handle it from here.
-Okay, Sir.

2233
02:08:37.579 --> 02:08:38.537 line:82%
Here.

2234
02:08:40.454 --> 02:08:42.662 line:82%
How many times do I have to
tell you not to rush?

2235
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:44.079 line:82%
How do you know
it was those three?

2236
02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:46.745 line:82%
Those were the only three with me.

2237
02:08:47.079 --> 02:08:48.370 line:82%
So, who else if not them?

2238
02:08:49.037 --> 02:08:50.912 line:82%
You rush without
knowing the full story.

2239
02:08:51.245 --> 02:08:52.579 line:82%
Okay, get here soon.

2240
02:08:57.995 --> 02:08:59.454 line:82%
Did Dad ask you to leave?

2241
02:08:59.829 --> 02:09:00.745 line:82%
Yeah.

2242
02:09:06.495 --> 02:09:08.245 line:82%
Hey, stop the jeep.

2243
02:09:08.454 --> 02:09:09.912 line:82%
-Drop me over there.
-Wait.

2244
02:09:10.370 --> 02:09:11.454 line:82%
Stop the car.

2245
02:09:15.870 --> 02:09:16.870 line:82%
Get down.
I'll tell you.

2246
02:09:17.245 --> 02:09:18.204 line:82%
Why?

2247
02:09:18.495 --> 02:09:19.912 line:82%
Kaali, get down.
I'll tell you.

2248
02:09:24.829 --> 02:09:25.787 line:82%
Brother.

2249
02:09:38.745 --> 02:09:39.912 line:82%
I need to know something.

2250
02:09:40.829 --> 02:09:41.787 line:82%
What is it?

2251
02:09:42.995 --> 02:09:44.662 line:82%
Where were you
when I got arrested?

2252
02:09:46.037 --> 02:09:47.204 line:82%
Is this the time for this?

2253
02:09:48.662 --> 02:09:49.620 line:82%
Get going.

2254
02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:51.704 line:82%
I'm talking to you.

2255
02:09:53.954 --> 02:09:55.537 line:82%
You don’t understand
the value of a life.

2256
02:09:57.620 --> 02:09:59.079 line:82%
The police will be here soon.

2257
02:09:59.329 --> 02:10:00.329 line:82%
Let's talk later.

2258
02:10:02.912 --> 02:10:03.995 line:82%
Answer me.
Where were you?

2259
02:10:09.329 --> 02:10:10.245 line:82%
Hey!

2260
02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:11.954 line:82%
Where will one go
to take down the SP?

2261
02:10:14.787 --> 02:10:15.870 line:82%
Near his house, of course.

2262
02:10:17.370 --> 02:10:19.120 line:82%
To hell with your interrogation.

2263
02:10:20.579 --> 02:10:22.204 line:82%
Had I been in your place…

2264
02:10:22.829 --> 02:10:25.454 line:82%
I’d be asking what time
you got arrested.

2265
02:10:26.495 --> 02:10:27.704 line:82%
I wouldn't have replied.

2266
02:10:29.495 --> 02:10:32.037 line:82%
How do you know
the time of my arrest?

2267
02:10:32.412 --> 02:10:33.329 line:82%
Huh?

2268
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:36.370 line:82%
Come on, guys.
Surround him.

2269
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:42.787 line:82%
It was you, right?

2270
02:10:43.162 --> 02:10:44.079 line:82%
Huh?

2271
02:10:46.579 --> 02:10:47.662 line:82%
Answer me.
That was you, right?

2272
02:10:49.579 --> 02:10:50.537 line:82%
Kannan, don't.

2273
02:10:51.412 --> 02:10:52.329 line:82%
Get out of here.

2274
02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:54.454 line:82%
It's for your own good.

2275
02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:56.704 line:82%
Unlock SP's phone
and bring it here.

2276
02:10:56.745 --> 02:10:57.620 line:82%
Okay.

2277
02:10:58.412 --> 02:10:59.454 line:82%
We'll know soon.

2278
02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:07.120 line:82%
Brother, what’s the phone number
we gave to Kaali?

2279
02:11:07.287 --> 02:11:08.454 line:82%
Why now?

2280
02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:10.079 line:82%
Just give me.

2281
02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:12.037 line:82%
-98419…
-98419…

2282
02:11:12.204 --> 02:11:14.537 line:82%
-67963.
-67963.

2283
02:11:16.454 --> 02:11:17.454 line:82%
Where's Venkat?

2284
02:11:17.829 --> 02:11:18.787 line:82%
-Huh?
-I'll call him.

2285
02:11:19.995 --> 02:11:22.537 line:82%
Check if the number
is in his contacts.

2286
02:11:23.037 --> 02:11:23.995 line:82%
Give me.

2287
02:11:27.454 --> 02:11:28.870 line:82%
Venkat, where the hell did you go?

2288
02:11:28.995 --> 02:11:31.995 line:82%
Brother, Kaali asked me
to take his wife and kids home.

2289
02:11:32.204 --> 02:11:33.162 line:82%
That's why…

2290
02:11:33.995 --> 02:11:37.329 line:82%
Cleverly safeguarded
your family, huh?

2291
02:11:38.162 --> 02:11:40.204 line:82%
So, you planned everything.

2292
02:11:42.912 --> 02:11:45.620 line:82%
Hey, be there until I say otherwise.

2293
02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:47.912 line:82%
Be with his family.

2294
02:11:48.079 --> 02:11:49.037 line:82%
-Huh?
-
Okay, brother.

2295
02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:50.204 line:82%
I'll call you back.

2296
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:52.829 line:82%
Give me that.

2297
02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:54.579 line:82%
Brother…

2298
02:12:37.829 --> 02:12:38.745 line:82%
Kill him.

2299
02:12:53.579 --> 02:12:54.662 line:82%
Kill him, boys!

2300
02:13:02.745 --> 02:13:04.662 line:82%
Tell
Periyavar
about this.
Call him.

2301
02:13:49.829 --> 02:13:52.287 line:82%
I won't tell anybody, brother.
Please spare me.

2302
02:13:52.995 --> 02:13:54.245 line:82%
Kannan…

2303
02:14:17.162 --> 02:14:18.162 line:82%
You…

2304
02:14:19.079 --> 02:14:20.162 line:82%
My dad…

2305
02:14:20.662 --> 02:14:22.620 line:82%
I can see what he's going to

2306
02:14:22.912 --> 02:14:27.162 line:82%
do to you and your family.

2307
02:14:33.829 --> 02:14:35.454 line:82%
I warned you.

2308
02:14:42.370 --> 02:14:43.620 line:82%
Kaali…

2309
02:14:44.495 --> 02:14:45.329 line:82%
Listen.

2310
02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:48.037 line:82%
You already did half of my work.

2311
02:14:48.662 --> 02:14:50.120 line:82%
Go take care of your family now.

2312
02:14:50.204 --> 02:14:52.704 line:82%
I'll take care of Ravi.

2313
02:14:53.704 --> 02:14:56.245 line:82%
Your name will stay out of this, I swear.

2314
02:14:57.245 --> 02:14:58.495 line:82%
Trust me.

2315
02:14:59.829 --> 02:15:00.829 line:82%
You can leave now.

2316
02:15:01.704 --> 02:15:02.995 line:82%
Deal?

2317
02:15:09.037 --> 02:15:10.495 line:82%
Hey, come here.

2318
02:15:11.079 --> 02:15:11.912 line:82%
Where is Venkat?

2319
02:15:14.745 --> 02:15:15.995 line:82%
What did you do?

2320
02:15:16.287 --> 02:15:17.204 line:82%
Just answer me.

2321
02:15:17.787 --> 02:15:18.870 line:82%
Who did you kill?

2322
02:15:18.954 --> 02:15:20.287 line:82%
Shh! Keep your voice down!

2323
02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:26.162 line:82%
-That old lady let you go, right?
-Wait.

2324
02:15:26.204 --> 02:15:27.579 line:82%
Will she take care of my kids?

2325
02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:28.912 line:82%
Listen to me.
Come here.

2326
02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:29.995 line:82%
I WON'T!

2327
02:15:35.787 --> 02:15:37.162 line:82%
Whose blood is this?

2328
02:15:38.037 --> 02:15:39.245 line:82%
Does it belong to that policeman?

2329
02:15:41.954 --> 02:15:42.787 line:82%
SP…

2330
02:15:43.454 --> 02:15:44.370 line:82%
SP?

2331
02:15:44.829 --> 02:15:45.745 line:82%
-Did you kill him?
-No.

2332
02:15:45.829 --> 02:15:47.662 line:82%
-Did you kill the SP? Tell me.
-No, I didn't.

2333
02:15:51.787 --> 02:15:52.954 line:82%
Kannan…

2334
02:15:53.579 --> 02:15:54.495 line:82%
Huh?!

2335
02:15:57.329 --> 02:15:58.162 line:82%
It's over.

2336
02:15:58.829 --> 02:15:59.662 line:82%
It's over.

2337
02:16:19.537 --> 02:16:21.412 line:82%
Can't believe you killed Kannan!

2338
02:16:22.704 --> 02:16:23.620 line:82%
We're finished.

2339
02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:27.662 line:82%
For good.

2340
02:16:28.954 --> 02:16:32.454 line:82%
I warned you
so many times not to go.

2341
02:16:37.787 --> 02:16:39.079 line:82%
I…

2342
02:16:39.537 --> 02:16:41.704 line:82%
I can never forgive you!

2343
02:16:45.662 --> 02:16:46.662 line:82%
Neither can I.

2344
02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:52.370 line:82%
Oh my!

2345
02:16:55.745 --> 02:16:57.079 line:82%
I will never leave your side again.

2346
02:17:04.579 --> 02:17:05.454 line:82%
I promise…

2347
02:17:07.704 --> 02:17:08.995 line:82%
I swear on our daughter.

2348
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:10.704 line:82%
I will never go.

2349
02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:16.579 line:82%
Who is it?

2350
02:17:17.912 --> 02:17:18.829 line:82%
Sir?

2351
02:17:22.704 --> 02:17:23.537 line:82%
No, Sir.

2352
02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:28.954 line:82%
I'm almost home.

2353
02:17:31.787 --> 02:17:32.620 line:82%
Okay.

2354
02:17:34.787 --> 02:17:36.370 line:82%
Why did you say you were home?

2355
02:17:37.204 --> 02:17:38.412 line:82%
He's on his way here.

2356
02:17:38.495 --> 02:17:41.412 line:82%
-For what, Kaali?
-I don't know.

2357
02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:45.579 line:82%
Listen.
Act normal in front of him.

2358
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:47.745 line:82%
I will handle everything.
Okay?

2359
02:17:47.829 --> 02:17:48.745 line:82%
Get inside.

2360
02:17:49.245 --> 02:17:50.079 line:82%
Kaali.

2361
02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:53.079 line:82%
Wait.

2362
02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:55.329 line:82%
-I will get you some water.
-Hey, no need.

2363
02:18:32.079 --> 02:18:32.954 line:82%
Venkat?

2364
02:18:36.579 --> 02:18:37.495 line:82%
Hey, Venkat!

2365
02:18:37.662 --> 02:18:38.495 line:82%
Yes, brother.

2366
02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:41.454 line:82%
Oh my God!
No, no, no.

2367
02:18:45.204 --> 02:18:46.579 line:82%
Hey, get up.

2368
02:18:46.662 --> 02:18:48.079 line:82%
-You think he heard it?
-What are you even doing?

2369
02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:49.162 line:82%
Go inside.

2370
02:18:50.787 --> 02:18:51.787 line:82%
When did you get here?

2371
02:18:52.329 --> 02:18:53.370 line:82%
I didn't hear a sound.

2372
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:59.495 line:82%
I had my phone charging inside.

2373
02:19:00.204 --> 02:19:01.495 line:82%
And was waiting for you to come.

2374
02:19:02.954 --> 02:19:04.245 line:82%
I will take it and leave now.

2375
02:19:07.704 --> 02:19:08.662 line:82%
Where is Kannan?

2376
02:19:11.995 --> 02:19:12.912 line:82%
I don't know.

2377
02:19:13.954 --> 02:19:14.995 line:82%
Wasn't he with you?

2378
02:19:16.329 --> 02:19:17.287 line:82%
Did he leave?

2379
02:19:19.995 --> 02:19:20.829 line:82%
Yes, he did.

2380
02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:28.954 line:82%
It's already late.

2381
02:19:29.204 --> 02:19:30.204 line:82%
Uncle will start looking for me.

2382
02:19:31.412 --> 02:19:32.495 line:82%
I better get going.

2383
02:19:37.454 --> 02:19:40.537 line:82%
So, you didn't hear
anything we said?

2384
02:19:43.537 --> 02:19:44.454 line:82%
Tell me.

2385
02:19:49.745 --> 02:19:50.620 line:82%
Not a word.

2386
02:20:10.829 --> 02:20:11.662 line:82%
Brother…

2387
02:20:41.620 --> 02:20:42.579 line:82%
Wa… water!

2388
02:20:43.704 --> 02:20:46.329 line:82%
You utter one word,
and you're dead.

2389
02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:50.495 line:82%
Hey!

2390
02:20:53.870 --> 02:20:54.870 line:82%
Venkat?

2391
02:20:55.995 --> 02:20:57.704 line:82%
Hey!

2392
02:20:57.995 --> 02:20:58.912 line:82%
Hey Venkat!

2393
02:20:59.454 --> 02:21:02.120 line:82%
-Water… water.
-Hang on.

2394
02:21:05.162 --> 02:21:06.120 line:82%
Venkat…

2395
02:21:06.204 --> 02:21:08.995 line:82%
Wait! Hold on.
Don't give up!

2396
02:21:09.079 --> 02:21:10.079 line:82%
I will be right back.

2397
02:21:10.787 --> 02:21:11.704 line:82%
Hold on.

2398
02:21:13.204 --> 02:21:14.579 line:82%
Water… water.

2399
02:21:15.245 --> 02:21:16.079 line:82%
Water…

2400
02:21:21.537 --> 02:21:22.454 line:82%
Kaali!

2401
02:21:22.829 --> 02:21:24.120 line:82%
-What happened?
-Nothing.

2402
02:21:24.204 --> 02:21:25.120 line:82%
Where is Venkat?

2403
02:21:25.245 --> 02:21:27.079 line:82%
-I will be right back.
-Where are you going?

2404
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:50.787 line:82%
Kaali!

2405
02:21:55.287 --> 02:21:56.204 line:82%
Kaali!

2406
02:22:00.662 --> 02:22:02.412 line:82%
-What happened?
-Nothing, ma'am.

2407
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:07.995 line:82%
I'm confident now.
I will get my son back.

2408
02:22:08.204 --> 02:22:09.245 line:82%
You will bring him to me.

2409
02:22:09.662 --> 02:22:10.495 line:82%
Kaali.

2410
02:22:10.912 --> 02:22:12.537 line:82%
Kannan's phone is unreachable.

2411
02:22:13.037 --> 02:22:14.787 line:82%
The others with him also
aren't answering my calls.

2412
02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:17.120 line:82%
Nothing would have happened.
I'm sure.

2413
02:22:17.162 --> 02:22:18.662 line:82%
You go.
Go and bring him to me.

2414
02:22:19.079 --> 02:22:20.162 line:82%
Alright. You come.

2415
02:22:23.079 --> 02:22:24.079 line:82%
Where is Venkat?

2416
02:22:28.454 --> 02:22:29.495 line:82%
He said he's here.

2417
02:22:30.162 --> 02:22:31.120 line:82%
Be right back.

2418
02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:33.287 line:82%
Kaali, let him be.

2419
02:22:53.579 --> 02:22:56.037 line:82%
The police are everywhere.

2420
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:58.495 line:82%
Let them stay here for an hour.

2421
02:22:58.995 --> 02:23:00.079 line:82%
I'll make alternate arrangements soon.

2422
02:23:00.245 --> 02:23:01.495 line:82%
-Okay?
-Sure.

2423
02:23:01.995 --> 02:23:02.829 line:82%
Go inside.

2424
02:23:03.537 --> 02:23:04.537 line:82%
-Go.
-Come in.

2425
02:23:05.954 --> 02:23:07.245 line:82%
-Go on.
-Go.

2426
02:23:08.079 --> 02:23:09.412 line:82%
Start the vehicle.

2427
02:23:10.662 --> 02:23:11.579 line:82%
Where is he?

2428
02:23:12.162 --> 02:23:14.079 line:82%
I… I don't know.

2429
02:23:14.287 --> 02:23:15.287 line:82%
Wait, I will be back.

2430
02:23:15.495 --> 02:23:17.079 line:82%
That's fine.
Come with me.

2431
02:23:23.537 --> 02:23:25.912 line:82%
I told you not to eat
fried food while pregnant.

2432
02:23:26.037 --> 02:23:29.120 line:82%
But you never listen.
Careful. Don't choke on it.

2433
02:23:44.829 --> 02:23:45.870 line:82%
Where is Venkat?

2434
02:23:46.287 --> 02:23:47.537 line:82%
He was right here. But…

2435
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:48.579 line:82%
I don't know.

2436
02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:50.370 line:82%
Can I get you coffee?

2437
02:23:50.495 --> 02:23:52.120 line:82%
Where did he go,
leaving his phone here?

2438
02:23:54.495 --> 02:23:55.829 line:82%
Would you like some Horlicks?

2439
02:24:00.954 --> 02:24:02.912 line:82%
I will get you some water.

2440
02:24:20.912 --> 02:24:21.745 line:82%
Sreeja.

2441
02:24:22.204 --> 02:24:23.079 line:82%
Sreeja?

2442
02:24:25.662 --> 02:24:26.787 line:82%
Mom is calling.

2443
02:24:38.995 --> 02:24:41.495 line:82%
Where did you go?
I told you not to go outside.

2444
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:47.120 line:82%
I want Horlicks.

2445
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:02.704 line:82%
Tell me.

2446
02:25:03.037 --> 02:25:04.079 line:82%
Where are you, Dad?

2447
02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:05.454 line:82%
Tell me, what's going on?

2448
02:25:05.537 --> 02:25:06.745 line:82%
Is Kaali with you?

2449
02:25:07.037 --> 02:25:07.954 line:82%
Yes, why?

2450
02:25:08.037 --> 02:25:08.995 line:82%
I hope you aren't on speaker.

2451
02:25:10.954 --> 02:25:11.787 line:82%
No, tell.

2452
02:25:12.079 --> 02:25:15.537 line:82%
I feel this house has something
to do with Kannan's disappearance.

2453
02:25:15.995 --> 02:25:17.120 line:82%
I doubt that.

2454
02:25:17.204 --> 02:25:18.579 line:82%
No, Dad. I have a strong feeling.

2455
02:25:18.745 --> 02:25:21.495 line:82%
Actually, Kalaivani shouldn't
let us inside her house, right?

2456
02:25:21.829 --> 02:25:23.745 line:82%
But now she's offering me Horlicks, Dad!

2457
02:25:24.204 --> 02:25:25.370 line:82%
And she looks tense!

2458
02:25:25.579 --> 02:25:27.037 line:82%
-Something is not right.
-Stop the vehicle.

2459
02:25:27.079 --> 02:25:28.745 line:82%
You come here right away.

2460
02:25:29.162 --> 02:25:31.704 line:82%
Dad, Kaali is definitely hiding something.

2461
02:25:32.245 --> 02:25:33.454 line:82%
You can't trust him.

2462
02:25:35.537 --> 02:25:37.037 line:82%
-Sir?
-You wait here, Kaali.

2463
02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:39.495 line:82%
Brother's car is parked here.

2464
02:25:40.037 --> 02:25:41.579 line:82%
But she isn't letting me see it.

2465
02:25:41.829 --> 02:25:43.245 line:82%
Venkat is missing too, Dad.

2466
02:25:44.037 --> 02:25:45.495 line:82%
Okay. I'll be there.

2467
02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:55.329 line:82%
Kaali.

2468
02:25:56.579 --> 02:25:57.620 line:82%
Where is my son?

2469
02:26:03.037 --> 02:26:04.079 line:82%
Tell me, please.

2470
02:26:05.370 --> 02:26:06.454 line:82%
Where is my son?

2471
02:26:14.162 --> 02:26:15.037 line:82%
So…

2472
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:18.662 line:82%
you do know where Kannan is.

2473
02:26:19.329 --> 02:26:20.162 line:82%
Right?

2474
02:26:23.287 --> 02:26:25.912 line:82%
Tell me now.
Where is my son?

2475
02:26:26.787 --> 02:26:27.995 line:82%
Hey, wait.

2476
02:26:28.287 --> 02:26:30.079 line:82%
Not one person should leave his house.

2477
02:26:31.079 --> 02:26:33.662 line:82%
I'll wipe out your entire family!

2478
02:26:33.829 --> 02:26:36.787 line:82%
Tell me, Kaali.
Where is my son?

2479
02:26:39.579 --> 02:26:41.579 line:82%
Where is he?
Crush him.

2480
02:26:41.745 --> 02:26:43.079 line:82%
Kaali!

2481
02:26:43.162 --> 02:26:44.454 line:82%
-KAALI!
-Hold her right there.

2482
02:26:44.495 --> 02:26:46.579 line:82%
Hey! Leave me.

2483
02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:47.579 line:82%
DAD!

2484
02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:48.579 line:82%
Leave me!

2485
02:26:48.662 --> 02:26:51.120 line:82%
-Hey, Kaali!
-You go inside.

2486
02:26:51.162 --> 02:26:51.995 line:82%
He knows the truth.

2487
02:26:52.037 --> 02:26:54.245 line:82%
-Ask him, Dad.
-Where is my son, Kaali?

2488
02:26:54.329 --> 02:26:55.495 line:82%
What did you do to my brother?

2489
02:27:04.662 --> 02:27:06.120 line:82%
Hey, you better spill.

2490
02:27:06.287 --> 02:27:07.287 line:82%
What did you do to my son?

2491
02:27:07.329 --> 02:27:09.329 line:82%
What did you do, Kaali?

2492
02:27:09.745 --> 02:27:11.370 line:82%
What the hell is going on here?

2493
02:27:12.037 --> 02:27:13.204 line:82%
-Dad!
-Get lost!

2494
02:27:15.454 --> 02:27:16.704 line:82%
-What the…
-Hey!

2495
02:27:17.079 --> 02:27:19.495 line:82%
-I'll bury your entire family!
-DAD!

2496
02:27:19.537 --> 02:27:20.870 line:82%
Listen to me, Dad.

2497
02:27:20.912 --> 02:27:21.995 line:82%
Our car!

2498
02:27:22.495 --> 02:27:23.954 line:82%
The dogs keep sniffing it.

2499
02:27:23.995 --> 02:27:25.704 line:82%
Let's check inside it.

2500
02:27:37.579 --> 02:27:40.245 line:82%
Get up. You're fine.
Move your hand.

2501
02:27:40.287 --> 02:27:41.704 line:82%
Don't you touch her.

2502
02:27:41.912 --> 02:27:42.829 line:82%
Stay away.

2503
02:27:44.329 --> 02:27:45.579 line:82%
Hey, who's there?

2504
02:27:45.620 --> 02:27:47.162 line:82%
I'm calling the police.

2505
02:27:47.412 --> 02:27:48.579 line:82%
What are you doing?

2506
02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:50.370 line:82%
Kalai? Kalai?

2507
02:28:00.662 --> 02:28:01.787 line:82%
Where is my son?

2508
02:28:02.662 --> 02:28:04.995 line:82%
You sent Kaali to kill me, didn't you?

2509
02:28:10.329 --> 02:28:12.370 line:82%
You know who really killed your son?
Him.

2510
02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:17.370 line:82%
He butchered your
son's hands and legs!

2511
02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:20.704 line:82%
Then shot him dead,
right in front of me.

2512
02:28:23.412 --> 02:28:25.537 line:82%
Mom, brother is gone.

2513
02:28:25.995 --> 02:28:28.620 line:82%
He is dead, Mom!

2514
02:28:29.287 --> 02:28:30.870 line:82%
Let's make a deal.

2515
02:28:32.245 --> 02:28:34.912 line:82%
Do whatever you wish
with Kaali and his family.

2516
02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:38.162 line:82%
I'll look the other way.

2517
02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:40.995 line:82%
I'll make sure no case
is filed against you.

2518
02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:43.245 line:82%
In return, let me go.

2519
02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:45.370 line:82%
So will I.

2520
02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:54.287 line:82%
My dear brother!

2521
02:28:55.495 --> 02:28:56.745 line:82%
KAALI!

2522
02:29:02.662 --> 02:29:03.745 line:82%
Give me the gun.

2523
02:29:03.870 --> 02:29:04.787 line:82%
Come on, fast.

2524
02:29:04.829 --> 02:29:05.704 line:82%
Kalai!

2525
02:29:05.787 --> 02:29:07.162 line:82%
Take the kids inside.

2526
02:29:07.537 --> 02:29:09.370 line:82%
Get up, Kaali.
He's here.

2527
02:29:09.579 --> 02:29:11.204 line:82%
Come on, get up.

2528
02:29:11.370 --> 02:29:12.579 line:82%
Get inside!

2529
02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:17.454 line:82%
Step back.

2530
02:29:17.495 --> 02:29:18.537 line:82%
Just stay back.

2531
02:29:18.954 --> 02:29:22.245 line:82%
I said stay back.
Drop the gun!

2532
02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:24.954 line:82%
If you touch my husband,

2533
02:29:25.245 --> 02:29:26.329 line:82%
I swear I'll kill her.

2534
02:29:26.954 --> 02:29:28.204 line:82%
I said go inside.

2535
02:29:28.287 --> 02:29:29.287 line:82%
Drop the gun.

2536
02:29:29.579 --> 02:29:31.370 line:82%
Do you want
your granddaughter alive or not?

2537
02:29:31.412 --> 02:29:33.245 line:82%
Hey, move away from him.

2538
02:29:34.037 --> 02:29:34.912 line:82%
Take your hands off him.

2539
02:29:34.954 --> 02:29:36.329 line:82%
Get up, Kaali.

2540
02:29:36.370 --> 02:29:37.329 line:82%
I said go inside.

2541
02:29:41.579 --> 02:29:42.704 line:82%
Hit her, man.

2542
02:29:46.245 --> 02:29:47.245 line:82%
Kaali!

2543
02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:51.037 line:82%
Hey! Hey!
Dad!

2544
02:29:51.745 --> 02:29:53.037 line:82%
Let go of him, Kaali.

2545
02:29:53.079 --> 02:29:53.912 line:82%
Let him go.

2546
02:29:54.162 --> 02:29:55.204 line:82%
Hold him back.

2547
02:29:55.495 --> 02:29:56.537 line:82%
Let go of Dad.

2548
02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:57.454 line:82%
Let him go!

2549
02:29:58.079 --> 02:29:58.829 line:82%
Dad.

2550
02:29:59.579 --> 02:30:00.662 line:82%
Let him go!

2551
02:30:01.079 --> 02:30:02.120 line:82%
Dad!

2552
02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:04.537 line:82%
Dad!

2553
02:30:06.245 --> 02:30:07.204 line:82%
-Kaali!
-I said go.

2554
02:30:07.329 --> 02:30:08.245 line:82%
Go!

2555
02:30:08.662 --> 02:30:09.829 line:82%
Go inside.

2556
02:30:09.912 --> 02:30:10.912 line:82%
Listen to me, Kaali.

2557
02:30:10.954 --> 02:30:11.954 line:82%
Let him go.

2558
02:30:12.037 --> 02:30:14.245 line:82%
Don't do this, Kaali.
Please don't hurt him.

2559
02:30:14.329 --> 02:30:16.995 line:82%
I won't be able to take it
if something happens to him, Kaali.

2560
02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:17.995 line:82%
Listen to me.

2561
02:30:18.079 --> 02:30:18.954 line:82%
Let him go.

2562
02:30:18.995 --> 02:30:20.662 line:82%
HEY! Let him go!

2563
02:30:20.745 --> 02:30:22.204 line:82%
Please, Kaali. Let him go.

2564
02:30:22.245 --> 02:30:24.829 line:82%
For my sake, Kaali.

2565
02:30:35.162 --> 02:30:36.745 line:82%

Hey, come on.
Catch him.

2591
02:34:13.037 --> 02:34:16.787 line:82%
How can we leave this place as is?
The cows and the calves are here.

2592
02:34:17.245 --> 02:34:18.662 line:82%
Who'll feed them?

2593
02:34:18.745 --> 02:34:19.704 line:82%
Careful!

2594
02:34:22.329 --> 02:34:24.120 line:82%
Where is my son, Kaali?

2595
02:34:25.329 --> 02:34:27.412 line:82%
At least tell me
where his corpse is.

2596
02:34:27.454 --> 02:34:28.495 line:82%
Tell me, please.

2597
02:34:29.537 --> 02:34:31.037 line:82%
Where is it?

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:41.620 line:82%
-Hold him down.

2600
02:34:44.745 --> 02:34:45.537 line:82%
He's…

2601
02:34:45.579 --> 02:34:46.745 line:82%
He's saying something.

2602
02:34:50.412 --> 02:34:52.079 line:82%
He's saying something.

2603
02:34:52.454 --> 02:34:53.912 line:82%
Listen to him.

2604
02:34:53.954 --> 02:34:55.454 line:82%
Please.

2605
02:34:55.495 --> 02:34:56.620 line:82%
Move.

2606
02:35:00.954 --> 02:35:01.870 line:82%
What is it?

2607
02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:11.245 line:82%
What's he saying?

2608
02:35:13.162 --> 02:35:14.079 line:82%
Sir…

2609
02:35:14.370 --> 02:35:15.454 line:82%
What did he say?

2610
02:35:19.579 --> 02:35:20.829 line:82%
Say it out loud, you idiot!

2611
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:23.162 line:82%
Sir.

2612
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:25.204 line:82%
He's saying he'll forgive you.

2613
02:35:26.454 --> 02:35:27.412 line:82%
And asking you to leave.

2614
02:35:28.829 --> 02:35:30.662 line:82%
Ma'am, he's asking you to take him home.

2615
02:35:31.579 --> 02:35:33.287 line:82%
-Finish him off.
-Okay, sir.

2616
02:35:34.412 --> 02:35:35.537 line:82%
Do you want to see your son?

2617
02:35:37.162 --> 02:35:38.287 line:82%
Want to see your son?

2618
02:35:39.079 --> 02:35:41.412 line:82%
-You want to see his body?
-Hey, stop.

2619
02:35:42.370 --> 02:35:43.412 line:82%
Where is he?

2620
02:35:44.495 --> 02:35:45.495 line:82%
Tell me where he is.

2621
02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:48.162 line:82%
Give me a minute.

2622
02:35:54.995 --> 02:35:56.745 line:82%
Water! Get me some water.

2623
02:36:03.454 --> 02:36:04.329 line:82%
Water.

2624
02:36:41.079 --> 02:36:41.954 line:82%
Give me a hand.

2625
02:36:51.704 --> 02:36:52.579 line:82%
You stay here.

2626
02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:54.912 line:82%
-Stay here.
-I want to see my son.

2627
02:36:57.537 --> 02:36:59.662 line:82%
-Oh my!
-Open it.

2628
02:37:03.954 --> 02:37:05.037 line:82%
Kanna!

2629
02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:07.454 line:82%
Kanna!

2630
02:37:47.162 --> 02:37:49.162 line:82%
-Kalai!
-Mom, keep going.

2631
02:37:51.204 --> 02:37:52.620 line:82%
Come on. Hold my hand.

2632
02:37:52.704 --> 02:37:54.204 line:82%
Go. Untie the cows.

2633
02:37:54.287 --> 02:37:55.204 line:82%
Kalai!

2634
02:38:16.995 --> 02:38:18.245 line:82%
I had to protect my family.

2635
02:38:21.162 --> 02:38:22.454 line:82%
I didn't have an option.

2636
02:38:29.537 --> 02:38:31.995 line:82%
Take your kids home.
Keep them safe.

2637
02:38:35.162 --> 02:38:36.204 line:82%
Please forgive me.

2638
02:38:55.454 --> 02:38:56.454 line:82%
Hey, what happened?

2639
02:38:56.954 --> 02:38:58.079 line:82%
Drink some water.
Bottle is in the bag.

2640
02:38:58.204 --> 02:38:59.120 line:82%
Drink it.

2641
02:39:05.829 --> 02:39:06.787 line:82%
Enough?

2642
02:39:24.495 --> 02:39:25.329 line:82%
Who is it?

2643
02:39:25.454 --> 02:39:27.037 line:82%
-Can't you get in at the bus stop?
-Get in.

2644
02:39:27.204 --> 02:39:28.954 line:82%
-Come. Get in.
-Get in, fast.

2645
02:39:29.079 --> 02:39:30.079 line:82%
Come on.

2646
02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:31.245 line:82%
Make it fast.

2647
02:39:31.787 --> 02:39:32.620 line:82%
Come.

2648
02:39:32.704 --> 02:39:33.579 line:82%
Take a seat.

2649
02:39:34.745 --> 02:39:36.287 line:82%
Where did you get this fan from?

2650
02:39:36.745 --> 02:39:37.829 line:82%
Don't take anything from strangers.

2651
02:39:37.870 --> 02:39:40.370 line:82%
-I told you that man bought it.
-Who?

2652
02:39:40.745 --> 02:39:44.870 line:82%
Remember the man who helped me
get to the hospital when I fainted on the road?

2653
02:39:44.954 --> 02:39:45.870 line:82%
It was him.

2654
02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:49.287 line:82%
Give me space.

2655
02:39:49.370 --> 02:39:52.495 line:82%
Why did you make a scene at their house
just because my phone was off?

2656
02:39:52.537 --> 02:39:55.579 line:82%
Who told you to rush
to the SP's office for that?

2657
02:39:55.604 --> 02:39:57.454 line:82%
Thank God!
It wasn't anything serious.

2658
02:39:57.787 --> 02:40:00.454 line:82%
Just a storm in a teacup.
