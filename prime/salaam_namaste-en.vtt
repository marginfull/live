1
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.739 line:82%
Good morning, Melbourne.
Hello and welcome

2
00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:13.824 line:82%
to your favorite radio station,

3
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.951 line:82%
Salaam Namaste!

4
00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:17.578 line:82%
And you're with me, Ambar.

5
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:20.539 line:82%
Cool as a cucumber, spicy as Sambar,

6
00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:22.208 line:82%
and lucky as a lottery number.

7
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:25.669 line:82%
And for those of you who haven't crawled
out of your blankets yet...

8
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.840 line:82%
that was your morning alarm.
It's just ten minutes to nine.

9
00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:32.468 line:82%
And it's a warm summer morning
in Melbourne city.

10
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.845 line:82%
At nine sharp, tune into my program,
Chit-Chat,

11
00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.889 line:82%
where I will introduce you

12
00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:40.226 line:82%
to some successful Indians living
in Melbourne, so that you too

13
00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.270 line:82%
are inspired to succeed.
And today, we'll be talking to

14
00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:45.606 line:82%
the head chef of the
Nick of Time restaurant, Nick.

15
00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.025 line:82%
That's in ten minutes. So stay tuned.

16
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.028 line:82%
Until then, here's a song to keep
your morning tea company.

17
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.698 line:82%
Where's the fire, guys?

18
00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:41.120 line:82%
Nikhil Arora has had only one problem
ever since he was a baby.

19
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:43.873 line:82%
He can't sleep at nights,
and can't wake up in the mornings.

20
00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:46.625 line:82%
Ever since, he has been
strangely fascinated with cooking,

21
00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.254 line:82%
and while other boys played cricket,
he played kitchen.

22
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.797 line:82%
When Nick grew up, his dad wanted

23
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.801 line:82%
Nick to become an architect
and join his construction business.

24
00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:58.053 line:82%
Nick came to Melbourne
to become an architect

25
00:02:58.137 --> 00:03:00.848 line:82%
but how could a guy who never drew
a straight line back home in India

26
00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.475 line:82%
design a Taj Mahal in Melbourne?

27
00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.394 line:82%
His interest in cooking never left him

28
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.938 line:82%
and Nikhil's parties were very popular.

29
00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:11.275 line:82%
Somehow, Nikhil managed to become
an architect and even landed a contract

30
00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.776 line:82%
to design a restaurant.

31
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.486 line:82%
The owner never liked the restaurant.

32
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.365 line:82%
But he loved Nick's food.
And Nikhil Arora became

33
00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.535 line:82%
the head chef of the Nick of Time
restaurant, Nick.

34
00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.593 line:82%
Slow it down, pal.
Who's screaming and why?

35
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:42.514 line:82%
Crap. I'm just... I'm almost there.

36
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.060 line:82%
I'm right outside your studio,
I'm looking for parking.

37
00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:48.562 line:82%
Dude, please, give your throat a break.

38
00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:50.147 line:82%
I'm on my way, I'm already here.

39
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.066 line:82%
Just walk to the door,
I'm coming right in.

40
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.734 line:82%
There, I can see you.

41
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.031 line:82%
Did the alarm ring?

42
00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:06.163 line:82%
When Deepan Nair's holler reverberated
through Kerala's greenery,

43
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.041 line:82%
coconuts fell off the trees,
boats capsized in rivers and

44
00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.085 line:82%
birds migrated to Karnataka.

45
00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.129 line:82%
But Deepan Nair,
whom Melbourne turned into Debonair,

46
00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:15.464 line:82%
was the "mallu" with a passion,

47
00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.883 line:82%
who even if he can't sing,
can still make you sing.

48
00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:22.513 line:82%
Now he owns Salaam Namaste radio
station and keeps humming at work,

49
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.849 line:82%
in the hope that someday,
someone will ask,

50
00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:26.934 line:82%
"Sir, why don't you ever sing on air?"

51
00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:30.229 line:82%
In the coming 40 years,
this will never happen.

52
00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.234 line:82%
Hambar, Hambar!

53
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:36.860 line:82%
Hambar!

54
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.445 line:82%
- Ambar.
- Hambar.

55
00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:39.655 line:82%
- "A!"
- "Yay."

56
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:40.906 line:82%
A for Ambar!

57
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.451 line:82%
Yay, Hambar. Stop wasting time.
Nick is late.

58
00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:47.579 line:82%
- What do you mean?
- I think he's just woken up.

59
00:04:49.832 --> 00:04:52.376 line:82%
After Ambar rejected
twelve men in Bangalore,

60
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.963 line:82%
her parents suspected that maybe
she didn't want to get married at all.

61
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.549 line:82%
She denied it, but it was the truth.

62
00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:00.926 line:82%
Her sister was the only example
she needed.

63
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.471 line:82%
When she came to Australia for a year
with a university exchange program,

64
00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:08.809 line:82%
Ambar fell in love with Melbourne.
She decided to stay on

65
00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:12.354 line:82%
and joined medical school.
Her parents cut off all ties with her.

66
00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:16.066 line:82%
To pay for her education, she joined
Salaam Namaste Radio Station

67
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.111 line:82%
and soon became the most popular RJ there.

68
00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:27.494 line:82%
Salaam Namaste! And now it's time

69
00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:29.747 line:82%
to talk to our celebrity guest, Nick.

70
00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:33.292 line:82%
But there's one slight problem.
And it's this.

71
00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.961 line:82%
Nick isn't interested in talking to you.

72
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.380 line:82%
So what if you happen to be
the same customers

73
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:41.842 line:82%
who shell out ten dollars
for his two-dollar dish.

74
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:45.596 line:82%
Nick doesn't care. Which is why
he never bothered coming here.

75
00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.265 line:82%
In fact, he's sleeping.

76
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:52.227 line:82%
So it's obvious how much
he values your time and mine.

77
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.149 line:82%
Excuse me.

78
00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:12.790 line:82%
And then I'd ask him why he changed
his name from Nikhil Arora to Nick?

79
00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.375 line:82%
Nikhil is eww. Nick is cool.

80
00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:19.463 line:82%
Is he one of those Indians
who are ashamed of being Indian?

81
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:20.756 line:82%
What is this Nick business?

82
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.884 line:82%
"Yo. I'm cool. I'm Australian. I'm Nick."

83
00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.594 line:82%
Crap! What's she doing?

84
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:29.848 line:82%
And what's worth thinking about is,
what else is Nikhil Arora ashamed of?

85
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:34.853 line:82%
For example, is he ashamed of his face?
Maybe he's really ugly.

86
00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:38.899 line:82%
Maybe that's why he became a chef.
To hide inside the kitchen

87
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:44.113 line:82%
and not show his face around.
Well, on that note, here's a song for you.

88
00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:45.531 line:82%
What the...

89
00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:51.703 line:82%
Hello... Nick here.

90
00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:55.916 line:82%
I'm almost there, pal.

91
00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.753 line:82%
But this chick, your announcer,
RJ, whatever, what's her name?

92
00:06:59.837 --> 00:07:00.837 line:82%
Hambar.

93
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.798 line:82%
Hambar? What's this
Hambar babe doing, dude?

94
00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:06.218 line:82%
Is this the way to talk about a guest?
I want to talk to her.

95
00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:08.137 line:82%
- Hello?
- Hello, is that Hambar?

96
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.848 line:82%
Hambar, Nick here.
What... what are you doing?

97
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.141 line:82%
Taking an interview.

98
00:07:12.224 --> 00:07:13.433 line:82%
- Whose?
- Yours.

99
00:07:13.517 --> 00:07:15.102 line:82%
But I'm not there yet.

100
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.586 line:82%
Really? I didn't even notice that.

101
00:07:17.664 --> 00:07:18.664 line:82%
Listen...

102
00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:21.525 line:82%
"Listen!" You bloody Nikhil Arora!

103
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.152 line:82%
You... Hambar!

104
00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:24.486 line:82%
Why are you calling me Hambar?

105
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.153 line:82%
Why are you calling me Nikhil Arora?

106
00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:27.236 line:82%
Because it's your name.

107
00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.448 line:82%
No, my name is Nick.

108
00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:33.413 line:82%
Really. Well, if you'd been here,
I'd have called you whatever you wanted.

109
00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:36.456 line:82%
Nick, Nicky, Marlon Brando.

110
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.208 line:82%
Hello, what's your problem?

111
00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:42.087 line:82%
I hate latecomers. Because of you
my show didn't start on time.

112
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:45.048 line:82%
If you start your show late one day,
what difference does it make?

113
00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.843 line:82%
Besides, who listens to your show
except for Indian taxi drivers?

114
00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.387 line:82%
Hello?

115
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.013 line:82%
Hello?

116
00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:55.893 line:82%
Salaam Namaste people,
and this is the end of the show.

117
00:07:56.018 --> 00:08:00.022 line:82%
And still, there's absolutely
no sign of Nikhil Arora.

118
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.440 line:82%
A small piece of advice,

119
00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:05.360 line:82%
if you plan to go to Nick of Time
restaurant be prepared to wait.

120
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:09.948 line:82%
Who knows, breakfast may appear
by lunchtime and lunch by dinnertime.

121
00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:13.618 line:82%
I think they should rename
the restaurant "Never on Time".

122
00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.495 line:82%
Anyway, it's goodbye from me, Ambar

123
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:19.666 line:82%
and keep listening
to Salaam Namaste, 101.5 FM.

124
00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.361 line:82%
Hey, mate, you're bleeding.

125
00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.614 line:82%
What? Oh, crap!

126
00:08:50.706 --> 00:08:54.743 line:82%
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I... I don't like blood.

127
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.287 line:82%
- You'd better see a doctor, man.
- No doctor.

128
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.497 line:82%
I don't like doctors.

129
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.499 line:82%
- But you're bleeding
- Stop saying that.

130
00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.172 line:82%
Want to catch a movie?

131
00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:18.100 line:82%
So, Jignesh, what's your diagnosis?

132
00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.980 line:82%
The patient has been experiencing
a vague pain in the abdomen,

133
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:26.817 line:82%
followed by severe bouts
of constipation, vomiting, swelling,

134
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:29.027 line:82%
bleeding stools and progressive weakness.

135
00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:30.737 line:82%
A biopsy can be conclusive.

136
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:34.866 line:82%
But my diagnosis suggests
lymphosarcoma of the intestine,

137
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:39.371 line:82%
just what Rajesh Khanna had in Anand.

138
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.876 line:82%
Born in Surat, and raised on
rice bread and rice sweets,

139
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.170 line:82%
Jignesh Pandya's one fear was

140
00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:51.091 line:82%
that he'd spend his whole life
behind the Archana Sarees cash register.

141
00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:54.594 line:82%
The business makes millions,
but it's not worth wasting life away.

142
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:58.348 line:82%
Perhaps it was fear that drove him
to pass the medical entrance test.

143
00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:01.768 line:82%
But now, homesick in Australia,
he's regretting his decision.

144
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.189 line:82%
Very nice, Jignesh. Good job.

145
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.652 line:82%
- 40.
- 20.

146
00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:11.820 line:82%
- 40.
- But why?

147
00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:14.364 line:82%
Because I know you've skipped homework

148
00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:17.534 line:82%
and you'll copy it off me, so 20 more.

149
00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:22.331 line:82%
When dad finds out that he's sponsoring
the education of two instead of one...

150
00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:24.499 line:82%
Long live Archana Sarees.

151
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:26.918 line:82%
- Now give me 100 more dollars.
- What for?

152
00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:29.296 line:82%
Because a friend is always
there when you need him.

153
00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.715 line:82%
Forget it. Why don't you go rob your dad?

154
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.011 line:82%
Ambar!

155
00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.555 line:82%
Ambar, I am sorry.

156
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.016 line:82%
Amby... I'm sorry.

157
00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:44.227 line:82%
It's just a loan dammit! I won't charge
you for the next five classes.

158
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.146 line:82%
But 100 dollars...

159
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.774 line:82%
Simone's wedding. I need to buy a dress.

160
00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:51.443 line:82%
Simone's... getting married?

161
00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:54.154 line:82%
Why? Didn't you get an invitation?

162
00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:55.906 line:82%
No.

163
00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:00.744 line:82%
Don't feel bad, next time you will.

164
00:11:01.203 --> 00:11:04.873 line:82%
By the way, I'll need your car tomorrow.
Okay? Thank you! Bye!

165
00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.384 line:82%
Why are you so determined
to ruin my reputation?

166
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.763 line:82%
You forgot the bay leaf,
the cardamom is lacking.

167
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.811 line:82%
And please, everybody, come here.

168
00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:31.149 line:82%
Just because salt is cheap
does not mean we use it more.

169
00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:34.610 line:82%
We are not in India now.
Please, go easy on the salt.

170
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:38.031 line:82%
Now, I need to go and pee. Promise me

171
00:11:38.115 --> 00:11:40.992 line:82%
you won't ruin another dish
in the next five minutes.

172
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:42.786 line:82%
Promise me!

173
00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.371 line:82%
We promise, boss!

174
00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.123 line:82%
Thank you. Excuse me.

175
00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.589 line:82%
- Looks just like home-cooked food.
- Thank you, boss.

176
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:57.175 line:82%
So why did they step out to eat?
They could've made this at home.

177
00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:01.638 line:82%
Do you know the difference
between a wife and a mistress?

178
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.473 line:82%
I don't have either, boss.

179
00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:04.599 line:82%
No?

180
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.856 line:82%
A wife wears a sari,
a mistress wears a micro-mini.

181
00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:14.568 line:82%
A wife wears a wedding thread,
for the mistress, a diamond necklace.

182
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:18.697 line:82%
A wife wears a cotton nightgown,
the mistress gets red lingerie.

183
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:24.327 line:82%
And that is now a mistress. Get it? Good.

184
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.914 line:82%
- Boss. Dheka's looking for you.
- So?

185
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.375 line:82%
- He looks quite angry.
- Tell me something new.

186
00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:32.252 line:82%
I've dammed a waterfall here.

187
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:50.020 line:82%
It's amazing how Aslam Dheka flew from
Dhaka to Melbourne on one ticket.

188
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:53.773 line:82%
He sat on two seats
and ate enough food for three.

189
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:57.486 line:82%
The sound of his belch
is still echoing in that Boeing 747.

190
00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:00.489 line:82%
He spent his life savings
buying a hot dog stand.

191
00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:01.990 line:82%
Dheka was a happy man.

192
00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:05.118 line:82%
He ate some and he sold some.
Then luck smiled on him

193
00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:07.746 line:82%
when a drunk driver crashed
into his stand,

194
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.957 line:82%
at the same time a lawyer happened
to be eating his last hot dog.

195
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.335 line:82%
They sued and Dheka struck gold.

196
00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:18.131 line:82%
And overnight he became the owner
and chief patron of Nick of Time.

197
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.549 line:82%
You see?

198
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.176 line:82%
See what?

199
00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:26.556 line:82%
See nothing! No people,
no customers, no one! Why?

200
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.891 line:82%
How should I know?

201
00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:29.768 line:82%
Salaam Namaste.

202
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:30.894 line:82%
Same to you.

203
00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.396 line:82%
All this is happening because
of your radio station!

204
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.691 line:82%
You were late and our restaurant
was insulted.

205
00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:39.152 line:82%
Now you'd better not be late, ever again!

206
00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:43.031 line:82%
And if you are, I will fire you!

207
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.285 line:82%
- Understand?
- Yeah.

208
00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:51.081 line:82%
Tomorrow, ten o' clock sharp.
Understand? Otherwise...

209
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:52.457 line:82%
Fire?

210
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.544 line:82%
Murder!

211
00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:06.221 line:82%
Hello?

212
00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.056 line:82%
Are you hearing the radio?

213
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.517 line:82%
No, what is happening?

214
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.894 line:82%
You put on radio and listen.

215
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.691 line:82%
So Radhika, your first novel
is coming out tomorrow.

216
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.402 line:82%
How are you going to celebrate?

217
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.904 line:82%
I guess I'll celebrate with my husband.

218
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:24.948 line:82%
Romantic dinner, pop some champagne.

219
00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.951 line:82%
Wow. Which restaurant?
Not Nick of Time, I hope?

220
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.495 line:82%
Why? I've heard it's a nice place.

221
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:31.663 line:82%
Come on, Radhika.

222
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:37.711 line:82%
Eating what someone else has cooked
is like putting your life in their hands.

223
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:39.879 line:82%
- Like a doctor, right?
- Right.

224
00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:44.801 line:82%
Then can you trust a man who lies,
who is never on time

225
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:49.139 line:82%
and who doesn't even have the decency
to apologize for making you wait?

226
00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:50.557 line:82%
I think it's disgusting.

227
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.755 line:82%
Tell me would you tolerate this
behavior from your husband?

228
00:14:54.127 --> 00:14:57.814 line:82%
- I'm sorry, but what's the connection?
- There is a connection!

229
00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.567 line:82%
How can you trust a man
who's ashamed to be an Indian?

230
00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:02.944 line:82%
My god, you're really angry.

231
00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:08.033 line:82%
Yes. And Mr. Nikhil Arora
will have to face my anger

232
00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:11.161 line:82%
until he calls and apologizes
to my listeners.

233
00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:16.625 line:82%
It'll break.

234
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:19.044 line:82%
Come on, Dheka,
who listens to that show anyway?

235
00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:21.087 line:82%
I will tell you who is listening.

236
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.089 line:82%
My wife listens, my son listens,

237
00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.799 line:82%
my family listens.

238
00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:27.469 line:82%
Everybody's calling and
and asking me, "What is this?"

239
00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:31.556 line:82%
They all eat for free, anyway.
Think of all the money you'll save.

240
00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.892 line:82%
I will kill you.

241
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.771 line:82%
For our restaurant's bad reputation,
I'll kill you.

242
00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.398 line:82%
Dheka, relax. You'll have a heart attack.

243
00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:42.817 line:82%
I'll just call that Hambar
and fix everything.

244
00:15:44.337 --> 00:15:46.246 line:82%
Good. Are you at the wedding?

245
00:15:46.347 --> 00:15:48.156 line:82%
Just parking my car.

246
00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.368 line:82%
I'm almost there.

247
00:15:51.452 --> 00:15:53.828 line:82%
Hello? Hello, I can't hear you.

248
00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.037 line:82%
Nice day, isn't it?

249
00:16:39.609 --> 00:16:41.418 line:82%
I'm Ron. Ron.

250
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:42.711 line:82%
I'm Lisa.

251
00:16:42.795 --> 00:16:47.048 line:82%
Lisa. Lisa's such a nice name, Lisa.
What do you do, Lisa?

252
00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.759 line:82%
For 50 bucks, anything you want.

253
00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.305 line:82%
During college, Ranjan Mathur
was so busy studying

254
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:57.684 line:82%
that he was oblivious to the basic
differences between boys and girls.

255
00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.061 line:82%
Although he became
a successful architect,

256
00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:03.231 line:82%
his vision cleared up one day,
and he suddenly realized that

257
00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.775 line:82%
besides the shapes of buildings,
there were other shapes,

258
00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.485 line:82%
which were much more interesting.

259
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.280 line:82%
Since then, he has been
wearing his heart on his sleeve,

260
00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.949 line:82%
throwing it at every girl he sees,

261
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:16.098 line:82%
hoping that someday, somewhere,
some girl will catch his heart.

262
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.079 line:82%
Ron!

263
00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.999 line:82%
- I've got to go. Thank you...
- Okay, okay, 40.

264
00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.208 line:82%
- 40.
- It's all right.

265
00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:23.501 line:82%
Hey, Ranjan Mathur!

266
00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:25.086 line:82%
- 40.
- Thank you, thank you.

267
00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.549 line:82%
So, who was that?

268
00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:31.843 line:82%
A friend.

269
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.679 line:82%
- From office?
- No. She lives nearby.

270
00:17:35.175 --> 00:17:37.807 line:82%
- What was her name?
- Lisa.

271
00:17:38.238 --> 00:17:41.519 line:82%
So, let's give her a lift. The poor girl's
standing all alone at the bus stop.

272
00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.521 line:82%
No. No.

273
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.232 line:82%
She's going the other way.
So it's pointless.

274
00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.487 line:82%
- What?
- How much was she asking for?

275
00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:51.988 line:82%
Forty dollars.

276
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.326 line:82%
Ron! Can't you tell?

277
00:17:56.659 --> 00:18:02.540 line:82%
How could I? She smiled sweetly,
shook hands, even said her name.

278
00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.334 line:82%
I thought she was so friendly.

279
00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.795 line:82%
You must've started planning
your wedding already.

280
00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:09.798 line:82%
What rubbish!
I'm not that desperate. Please.

281
00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.509 line:82%
Just planned the engagement.

282
00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:19.140 line:82%
Tell me something,
why am I coming with you?

283
00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:22.727 line:82%
Because weddings are very boring
and I don't want to get bored alone.

284
00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.437 line:82%
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

285
00:18:25.018 --> 00:18:26.256 line:82%
What do you want to listen to?

286
00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:28.274 line:82%
Salaam Namaste.

287
00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.444 line:82%
- What?
- Let's hear your praises on the radio.

288
00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:33.029 line:82%
Oh, crap! You've heard it too?

289
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.989 line:82%
Of course, it's damn good fun!

290
00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:36.658 line:82%
That RJ is making you famous.

291
00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:39.160 line:82%
- You think this is funny?
- Very.

292
00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.789 line:82%
You're laughing and I've lost
half my clients at the restaurant.

293
00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.082 line:82%
Sue them.

294
00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.126 line:82%
Sue the damn radio station, yeah?

295
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.129 line:82%
Causing emotional distress,
mental trauma, character...

296
00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:53.383 line:82%
Hang on, let me just
call that Debonair character.

297
00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.926 line:82%
Just repeat all this.

298
00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440 line:82%
Hello?

299
00:18:57.524 --> 00:18:59.138 line:82%
I am going to sue you!

300
00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:03.351 line:82%
- Who is speaking please?
- This is Nick and I'm going to sue you.

301
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.645 line:82%
- What for?
- What for?

302
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:10.483 line:82%
- For emotional distress and...
- Mental trauma, character assassination.

303
00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.527 line:82%
mental trauma, character assassination.

304
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.239 line:82%
- I'm with a very big lawyer right now.
- My friend is with a very big lawyer.

305
00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.325 line:82%
- No, no. Not me. You, you.
- No, no... you, you.

306
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.453 line:82%
My friend is a very big lawyer.

307
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.797 line:82%
See, Mr. Nikhil Arora...

308
00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:26.457 line:82%
Stop calling me that!

309
00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:30.545 line:82%
If one more person calls me
Nikhil Arora, then I will... I will...

310
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.130 line:82%
- I'll never talk to you again.
- I'll never talk...

311
00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:35.341 line:82%
Sorry, I couldn't think of anything else.

312
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.721 line:82%
Listen. Why don't you
talk directly to Hambar?

313
00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.432 line:82%
Sure, come on. Give me Hambar's number.

314
00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.643 line:82%
Don't worry, I will connect you. Hold on.

315
00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:50.815 line:82%
Hello, listeners.
Breaking news on Salaam Namaste.

316
00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:55.778 line:82%
Nikhil Arora has just
called to apologize to Hambar.

317
00:19:56.613 --> 00:20:00.617 line:82%
We are taking you live
to the conversation.

318
00:20:01.745 --> 00:20:02.785 line:82%
Hello?

319
00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:04.037 line:82%
Hambar?

320
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.373 line:82%
Ambar. The name is Ambar. 'A' for Ambar.

321
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:12.295 line:82%
And the name is Nick,
not Nikhil Arora, okay?

322
00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:13.755 line:82%
- You!
- Yes, me!

323
00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:17.592 line:82%
So you've finally decided
to be sensible and say sorry.

324
00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.803 line:82%
Sorry? Are you crazy?

325
00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.472 line:82%
I'm calling because...

326
00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:26.393 line:82%
look, what you're doing is not right.

327
00:20:26.477 --> 00:20:27.477 line:82%
And what am I doing?

328
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.811 line:82%
You're ruining my reputation.

329
00:20:29.005 --> 00:20:30.005 line:82%
How?

330
00:20:30.328 --> 00:20:33.232 line:82%
By calling me Nikhil Arora
for a start. And...

331
00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:36.945 line:82%
I am so sorry.

332
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:40.323 line:82%
I had no idea you hated your name so much.

333
00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.825 line:82%
- I won't do it again.
- Thank you.

334
00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:44.953 line:82%
Nikhil Arora.

335
00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:46.204 line:82%
Nikhil Arora.

336
00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.455 line:82%
Stop it!

337
00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:50.249 line:82%
Nikhil Arora.

338
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.127 line:82%
You start singing her name as well.

339
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.964 line:82%
Hambar, Hambar.

340
00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:06.933 line:82%
What are you doing?

341
00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:09.769 line:82%
If you can sing my name,
I can sing yours.

342
00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:13.231 line:82%
Listen, what's your problem?

343
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:14.899 line:82%
What's your problem?

344
00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:17.068 line:82%
Just because I was
a bit late for your stupid show,

345
00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:20.530 line:82%
you're tying to destroy my life,
my career, everything?

346
00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.781 line:82%
I would've tolerated your coming late,

347
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:25.451 line:82%
if you had the decency
to call and apologize.

348
00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:29.789 line:82%
Apologize? For a two-bit radio show?

349
00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.416 line:82%
Forget it!

350
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:36.295 line:82%
Two-bit? Fine. Now just wait and watch

351
00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:39.846 line:82%
how this two-bit radio show transforms
you from a chef to a waiter.

352
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:40.930 line:82%
Good on ya, Ambar.

353
00:21:41.013 --> 00:21:42.702 line:82%
Yes, Ambar! Go for it.

354
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.016 line:82%
Sorry.

355
00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:52.228 line:82%
Sorry. That's better.

356
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.106 line:82%
You've finally come to your senses.

357
00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:57.275 line:82%
What? I wasn't talking to you.

358
00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.944 line:82%
It's all right, Nikhil.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

359
00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:02.404 line:82%
You made a mistake,
and now you've apologized.

360
00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:06.743 line:82%
Now listen to me. I'm going to give
you another chance. But for that

361
00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:09.454 line:82%
- you'll have to come on time for my show.
- I have an idea.

362
00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.789 line:82%
Stuff your show in a bag
and give it to me.

363
00:22:11.873 --> 00:22:14.750 line:82%
A garbage truck visits
my restaurant every night.

364
00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:16.169 line:82%
Nice one.

365
00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:21.215 line:82%
I'm sure it does. Because no one eats
at your restaurant these days,

366
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:23.259 line:82%
so it must all go down the drain.

367
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.645 line:82%
Give her a last warning.

368
00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:36.481 line:82%
Look Ambar, this is your last warning...

369
00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:39.150 line:82%
Stuff your last warning and listen to me.

370
00:22:39.233 --> 00:22:41.819 line:82%
Unless you appear on my show
and apologize to my listeners

371
00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:44.113 line:82%
I won't let you off the hook. Now decide.

372
00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:48.201 line:82%
Your pride or your career?
You'll sacrifice at least one of them.

373
00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:49.535 line:82%
You! You...

374
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.746 line:82%
Salaam Namaste.

375
00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:55.583 line:82%
What happened?

376
00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:57.418 line:82%
I think I won.

377
00:22:57.502 --> 00:23:00.171 line:82%
Good. Well done, I'm proud of you.

378
00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:46.342 line:82%
Obviously you're not
gaping like that at my food.

379
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.389 line:82%
My palm is itching.

380
00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:55.601 line:82%
I have a feeling that the line
of romance is finally emerging.

381
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.631 line:82%
Congratulations.
Who have you fallen for now?

382
00:23:58.715 --> 00:24:01.440 line:82%
All five. I'm going to try
for all five of them.

383
00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:05.611 line:82%
I'll drop my handkerchief
and pick it up and say,

384
00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:07.613 line:82%
"Excuse me, I think you dropped this."

385
00:24:07.697 --> 00:24:10.867 line:82%
Ron, it has your name on it.

386
00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:12.118 line:82%
Damn.

387
00:24:12.326 --> 00:24:16.914 line:82%
Yes! I'll drop it, pick it up and say,
"It's mine, do you want it?"

388
00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:19.333 line:82%
Okay, Ron, I have a lot of work.

389
00:24:21.544 --> 00:24:23.129 line:82%
- Drop that!
- Why?

390
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:26.215 line:82%
Because it's not lunchtime yet.
And you're spoiling my arrangement.

391
00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:27.466 line:82%
Buzz off.

392
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.550 line:82%
You...

393
00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:30.678 line:82%
What are you doing? He's a kid.

394
00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:34.765 line:82%
That's the problem.
Why do people have kids?

395
00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:38.978 line:82%
Why can't we just be born adults?
Irritating bloody creatures.

396
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:25.024 line:82%
Hello.

397
00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:36.744 line:82%
She's going to break my back.

398
00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:40.623 line:82%
- Who's that guy?
- I don't know.

399
00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:42.208 line:82%
Anyway, let's get a drink.

400
00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:58.766 line:82%
Any luck?

401
00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:00.351 line:82%
Lesbians.

402
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:03.354 line:82%
The first one said we've never met before.

403
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:05.856 line:82%
The second one said
the handkerchief wasn't hers.

404
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.192 line:82%
The third one said ''Thank you'',
took it and left.

405
00:26:08.484 --> 00:26:11.279 line:82%
And then, the Japanese girl.
First she bowed, then I bowed.

406
00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:14.824 line:82%
She bowed again, so I bowed again.
Before I straightened up, she was gone.

407
00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:19.203 line:82%
Mind-blowing. So who's left?

408
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.289 line:82%
That Indian chick.

409
00:26:22.206 --> 00:26:23.207 line:82%
She's quite hot.

410
00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:24.709 line:82%
Yeah and she's very smart.

411
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:28.462 line:82%
She's studying to be a surgeon.
She's in college with Simone.

412
00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:31.632 line:82%
- You've obviously done your research.
- Yup.

413
00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:35.261 line:82%
Especially her. Because you've
been staring at her for so long.

414
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.639 line:82%
I don't know, there's something about her.

415
00:26:38.764 --> 00:26:40.266 line:82%
There is, there is.

416
00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:42.852 line:82%
- Why don't you ask her for a dance?
- Really?

417
00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:45.354 line:82%
Yeah, you must. Got your handkerchief?

418
00:26:46.564 --> 00:26:49.984 line:82%
- Hey, chef or architect?
- I think chef's cooler.

419
00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:51.652 line:82%
She's going to be a surgeon.

420
00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:54.363 line:82%
- Architect then.
- Good choice.

421
00:26:56.741 --> 00:26:58.492 line:82%
- Hi.
- Hi.

422
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.786 line:82%
Thanks.

423
00:27:01.162 --> 00:27:03.789 line:82%
Need some help?
I give a very good foot massage.

424
00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:06.834 line:82%
Really, I have like a...
black belt in foot massaging.

425
00:27:07.168 --> 00:27:10.296 line:82%
Really? And how many girls
have you tried that line on?

426
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:12.298 line:82%
We're all born with certain qualities.

427
00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:15.509 line:82%
You're beautiful,
I give a good foot massage.

428
00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:17.928 line:82%
You dodged the bouquet well.

429
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.711 line:82%
You noticed? Quite impressive.

430
00:27:20.795 --> 00:27:24.185 line:82%
They say that if you catch the bouquet,
you're next in line to get married.

431
00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:26.854 line:82%
I know. So I didn't take a chance.

432
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:31.067 line:82%
- You have a problem with marriage?
- Just a small one.

433
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.693 line:82%
- What?
- Husbands.

434
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:38.991 line:82%
- So you're going to be a surgeon?
- Is the news out already?

435
00:27:39.075 --> 00:27:41.452 line:82%
My friend over there... Ron.

436
00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:48.000 line:82%
He keeps tabs on all the pretty girls.

437
00:27:48.084 --> 00:27:49.913 line:82%
Hmm... you're trying to compliment me.

438
00:27:49.997 --> 00:27:52.403 line:82%
You noticed? Quite impressive.

439
00:27:54.382 --> 00:27:57.051 line:82%
- Dance?
- I'm sorry, my shoes hurt.

440
00:27:57.134 --> 00:27:58.260 line:82%
So leave them here.

441
00:27:58.344 --> 00:28:00.304 line:82%
- Don't be silly.
- No, I'm serious.

442
00:28:00.388 --> 00:28:01.972 line:82%
Come on, I'll take mine off as well.

443
00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:06.102 line:82%
Come on.

444
00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:16.445 line:82%
A friend of mine keeps tabs
on all the handsome boys as well.

445
00:28:16.904 --> 00:28:20.991 line:82%
Funny, she never mentioned you.
What's your name?

446
00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:23.410 line:82%
- Nick.
- Nick?

447
00:28:23.494 --> 00:28:27.123 line:82%
Nick. Why? It's a nice name.

448
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.126 line:82%
- And, what do you do?
- I'm an architect.

449
00:28:31.627 --> 00:28:35.714 line:82%
- Architect?
- Yes, why? I mean, what do I look like?

450
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:39.308 line:82%
No, I just happen to know another Nick.

451
00:28:39.392 --> 00:28:43.180 line:82%
Oh. And I thought I was going to be
the first Nick in your life.

452
00:28:46.684 --> 00:28:48.269 line:82%
Oh, crap!

453
00:28:48.354 --> 00:28:49.437 line:82%
What happened?

454
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.106 line:82%
- I hate kids!
- You hate kids?

455
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:56.777 line:82%
I mean, not like that, but when
their parents let them loose...

456
00:28:56.861 --> 00:29:00.281 line:82%
I mean, there ought to be
some discipline, right?

457
00:29:00.364 --> 00:29:03.409 line:82%
I'm sorry. You like kids?

458
00:29:03.826 --> 00:29:04.952 line:82%
Love them.

459
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.832 line:82%
Come on all bridesmaids!
Sarah, Amby, let's go take a photo.

460
00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:11.834 line:82%
Excuse me.

461
00:29:12.501 --> 00:29:13.752 line:82%
Don't go.

462
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.053 line:82%
Wait, hold it! Wait! Wait for me!

463
00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:25.890 line:82%
God, did I miss your wedding?

464
00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:28.976 line:82%
Yes, I can't believe
you actually missed my wedding.

465
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:31.979 line:82%
I am so sorry baby,
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

466
00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:33.981 line:82%
Nick, I'm in love.

467
00:29:35.024 --> 00:29:37.735 line:82%
- Right.
- No really, I'm in love.

468
00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:40.946 line:82%
I'm in love with that girl!

469
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.115 line:82%
I'm going to marry her,
have kids with her and...

470
00:29:43.199 --> 00:29:46.327 line:82%
I'll spend the rest of my life
with her. I swear it!

471
00:29:47.077 --> 00:29:48.829 line:82%
No more champagne for you.

472
00:29:51.248 --> 00:29:53.501 line:82%
Where's my handkerchief...
my handkerchief?

473
00:29:53.586 --> 00:29:54.877 line:82%
Say cheese.

474
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.587 line:82%
Cheese.

475
00:29:57.338 --> 00:29:59.465 line:82%
Everybody, out of your clothes.

476
00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:24.698 line:82%
One day, one moment, one life
Live for now, tomorrow flies

477
00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:33.958 line:82%
One day, one moment, one life
Live for now, tomorrow flies

478
00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:38.045 line:82%
It'll fly away, fly away

479
00:30:38.796 --> 00:30:43.175 line:82%
One day, one moment, one life
Live for now, tomorrow flies

480
00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:47.930 line:82%
It'll fly away, fly away

481
00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:53.311 line:82%
So, embrace life with a smile and say...

482
00:30:53.394 --> 00:30:58.190 line:82%
Salaam Namaste

483
00:31:39.607 --> 00:31:43.611 line:82%
Everything is swinging

484
00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:48.813 line:82%
Come and discover the signs of life

485
00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:53.454 line:82%
But just how useful these are

486
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:58.292 line:82%
These walls crumble soon
Once the moment is past

487
00:31:59.293 --> 00:32:04.048 line:82%
So lift your hands, clap a beat,
Come my love, let our heartbeats meet

488
00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:08.927 line:82%
A moment's ecstasy, a moment's excuse,
Time's so heartless, so what's the use?

489
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:12.973 line:82%
My love, my love, my love

490
00:32:14.892 --> 00:32:18.854 line:82%
So, embrace life with a smile and say...

491
00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:23.442 line:82%
Salaam Namaste

492
00:33:09.697 --> 00:33:13.951 line:82%
While walking on a path
You meet someone

493
00:33:14.785 --> 00:33:19.164 line:82%
Who is happy for your happiness

494
00:33:19.248 --> 00:33:24.044 line:82%
Then smile and talk to that person

495
00:33:24.128 --> 00:33:28.799 line:82%
Then see if luck smiles back at you

496
00:33:29.717 --> 00:33:34.096 line:82%
Life flies by, so tell your story
My love

497
00:33:34.555 --> 00:33:39.393 line:82%
Youth and time are going
Never to return, my love

498
00:33:39.476 --> 00:33:43.272 line:82%
My love, my love, my love

499
00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:49.111 line:82%
So, embrace life with a smile
And say...

500
00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:53.824 line:82%
Salaam Namaste

501
00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:55.529 line:82%
Ron?

502
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:57.805 line:82%
Why are you in a suit?

503
00:35:01.183 --> 00:35:02.226 line:82%
Ron?

504
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:06.396 line:82%
Nick, how long does it take
to get to know someone?

505
00:35:06.742 --> 00:35:10.108 line:82%
Depends. Sometimes one meeting is enough,
sometimes a lifetime falls short.

506
00:35:10.192 --> 00:35:14.154 line:82%
One meeting...
so I'm not being hasty then?

507
00:35:14.238 --> 00:35:15.823 line:82%
What are you talking about, Ron?

508
00:35:15.906 --> 00:35:17.241 line:82%
I'm getting married.

509
00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:19.910 line:82%
Good for you.

510
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.455 line:82%
I need some coffee.

511
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.586 line:82%
Ron, are you serious?

512
00:35:30.838 --> 00:35:32.089 line:82%
When?

513
00:35:35.885 --> 00:35:36.885 line:82%
To who?

514
00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:56.864 line:82%
Can't believe Cathy.

515
00:35:56.947 --> 00:35:58.532 line:82%
Can't believe Ron.

516
00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:04.162 line:82%
I still owe you a foot massage.

517
00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.999 line:82%
I know, my feet are really hurting.

518
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.669 line:82%
Apparently coffee's really
good for the feet as well.

519
00:36:10.794 --> 00:36:11.920 line:82%
Really?

520
00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:15.340 line:82%
Yeah. You're a doctor, you should know.

521
00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:18.844 line:82%
So, shall we?

522
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.888 line:82%
I'm sorry, I have work.

523
00:36:22.472 --> 00:36:24.808 line:82%
Well, actually, even I have
a few appointments.

524
00:36:27.144 --> 00:36:28.186 line:82%
Okay.

525
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.479 line:82%
Some other time then?

526
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:30.814 line:82%
Sure.

527
00:36:31.565 --> 00:36:33.525 line:82%
Okay, bye.

528
00:36:33.609 --> 00:36:34.610 line:82%
Bye.

529
00:36:37.613 --> 00:36:38.614 line:82%
Amby.

530
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.325 line:82%
Are you sure you've got to go?

531
00:36:42.284 --> 00:36:43.744 line:82%
Okay, let me check.

532
00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:53.045 line:82%
Hi, it's me Ambar. Not Hambar, Ambar.

533
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.340 line:82%
A. A for Ambar. Forget it.

534
00:36:57.007 --> 00:36:58.926 line:82%
Can somebody cover my show today?

535
00:37:03.555 --> 00:37:05.265 line:82%
It's okay, I'll be there.

536
00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:08.185 line:82%
Sorry.

537
00:37:09.186 --> 00:37:11.647 line:82%
- What happened?
- Hambar?

538
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:15.817 line:82%
My boss, Debonair. He can't say Ambar.

539
00:37:21.865 --> 00:37:25.160 line:82%
I guess... I'll be going.

540
00:37:28.038 --> 00:37:32.167 line:82%
Boss, everything's in the van.
I'll see you at the restaurant.

541
00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:48.208 line:82%
- Architect.
- Doctor.

542
00:37:48.292 --> 00:37:49.977 line:82%
- Nikhil Arora.
- Hambar.

543
00:37:51.228 --> 00:37:52.312 line:82%
Crap!

544
00:37:54.106 --> 00:37:56.191 line:82%
And she's completely ruined my reputation.

545
00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:58.068 line:82%
- You're right.
- But what a girl.

546
00:37:58.151 --> 00:38:00.404 line:82%
She's pretty, smart, funny.

547
00:38:00.904 --> 00:38:03.782 line:82%
- You're right.
- But she keeps calling me Nikhil Arora.

548
00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:05.617 line:82%
- She hates me.
- You're right.

549
00:38:05.909 --> 00:38:07.494 line:82%
But she plays great volleyball.

550
00:38:07.577 --> 00:38:09.830 line:82%
But he's never on time and he's very rude.

551
00:38:09.913 --> 00:38:12.499 line:82%
- That's true.
- But he's a damn good cook.

552
00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:15.043 line:82%
- The food at the wedding was great.
- That's true.

553
00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:17.838 line:82%
- So, should I call her or not?
- Do it.

554
00:38:18.338 --> 00:38:21.425 line:82%
- What if she insults me again?
- You also insulted her.

555
00:38:21.508 --> 00:38:24.553 line:82%
- You even threatened to sue her.
- But you told me to.

556
00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:25.887 line:82%
And I'm telling you to call her.

557
00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:28.063 line:82%
How can I call him?
He'll never talk to me.

558
00:38:28.147 --> 00:38:30.392 line:82%
You insulted him first,
you should call him first.

559
00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:33.145 line:82%
But she started it. She should call first.

560
00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:36.648 line:82%
But he threatened to sue me.
He should call first.

561
00:38:40.193 --> 00:38:41.945 line:82%
It doesn't really matter who calls first.

562
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.947 line:82%
Look, I think you ought to...

563
00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:48.660 line:82%
You're calling him?

564
00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:54.958 line:82%
Busy. He'll call me if he wants to.

565
00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:02.039 line:82%
What happened?

566
00:39:02.794 --> 00:39:06.720 line:82%
Busy. Forget it, she'll call
if she wants to.

567
00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:10.557 line:82%
Hey, Jen.

568
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.351 line:82%
- Hey. I've got some messages for you.
- Thank you.

569
00:39:21.193 --> 00:39:24.112 line:82%
He was here at seven o'clock
sharp for the interview.

570
00:39:24.196 --> 00:39:28.200 line:82%
The leopard changes his spots.
Hambar versus Nick.

571
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:46.510 line:82%
Aren't you going to give me the rest?

572
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.263 line:82%
These are for Debonair.

573
00:39:56.061 --> 00:39:58.230 line:82%
Hambar versus Nick.

574
00:39:58.313 --> 00:39:59.981 line:82%
Are you a chef or an architect?

575
00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:04.569 line:82%
Well, an architect by qualification.
But a chef by choice.

576
00:40:04.653 --> 00:40:08.073 line:82%
- Then why did you become an architect?
- To make my Dad happy.

577
00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:10.408 line:82%
- And why did you become a chef?
- To make myself happy.

578
00:40:10.492 --> 00:40:11.493 line:82%
All right.

579
00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:14.830 line:82%
So if you meet a beautiful girl
and she asks you what you do,

580
00:40:14.913 --> 00:40:15.956 line:82%
what will you say?

581
00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:19.126 line:82%
If the girl is well-educated,
like a lawyer or a doctor,

582
00:40:19.209 --> 00:40:20.792 line:82%
then I'll say I'm an architect.

583
00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:25.170 line:82%
But if she's creative,
like a writer or an RJ,

584
00:40:25.257 --> 00:40:28.176 line:82%
- then I'm a chef.
- So your truth is changeable.

585
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.181 line:82%
Well, truth is like a recipe. Some things
you hide and some you reveal.

586
00:40:33.265 --> 00:40:36.518 line:82%
So what's the one vital truth that
you've hidden so far and from whom?

587
00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.895 line:82%
My wife doesn't know that we're married.

588
00:40:41.565 --> 00:40:43.066 line:82%
Sorry, just kidding.

589
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.445 line:82%
Hambar! What is this? Attack! Charge!

590
00:40:47.529 --> 00:40:50.782 line:82%
If you became an architect to please
your Dad and a chef to please yourself,

591
00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:54.284 line:82%
what will you do to please your mother?
Marry a nice Indian girl?

592
00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:56.788 line:82%
Well, I don't believe in marriage. And...

593
00:40:57.289 --> 00:41:00.667 line:82%
if Mom was alive then, yes,
perhaps I'd even do that for her sake.

594
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.669 line:82%
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

595
00:41:02.752 --> 00:41:04.212 line:82%
Were you very close to her?

596
00:41:04.504 --> 00:41:06.756 line:82%
Very. I was only 14.

597
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.175 line:82%
So young.

598
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.679 line:82%
What is this! Where is Hambar versus Nick?

599
00:41:12.762 --> 00:41:14.097 line:82%
What is your favorite dish?

600
00:41:14.181 --> 00:41:16.808 line:82%
I'd have to say, Indian meatballs.

601
00:41:16.892 --> 00:41:20.312 line:82%
Will you tell us the recipe?
It's your punishment for being late.

602
00:41:20.395 --> 00:41:23.732 line:82%
Sure, you're going to need
onions, ginger, coriander, capsicum...

603
00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:27.152 line:82%
Slowly, slowly. Give our listeners
time to write this down.

604
00:41:27.861 --> 00:41:29.279 line:82%
Okay, sorry.

605
00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:34.201 line:82%
Mint, green chillies, sunflower oil...

606
00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:36.703 line:82%
I love you.

607
00:41:42.251 --> 00:41:43.251 line:82%
I love you.

608
00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:44.794 line:82%
- Are you crazy?
- No.

609
00:41:44.878 --> 00:41:48.298 line:82%
- Then what are you saying?
- That I love you.

610
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:51.927 line:82%
- You're nuts.
- Why? Because I love you?

611
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.639 line:82%
- You don't love me.
- Excuse me, how do you know that?

612
00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:59.017 line:82%
Look, you decide whether you
love me or not, that's your choice.

613
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.144 line:82%
Don't tell me that
I'm not in love with you.

614
00:42:02.604 --> 00:42:05.148 line:82%
- Mr. Nikhil Arora...
- The name is Nick.

615
00:42:05.232 --> 00:42:07.317 line:82%
Nick, Nick you are sick!

616
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.278 line:82%
You're saying this just to irritate
me because I insulted you on air.

617
00:42:10.362 --> 00:42:12.614 line:82%
No, you were right in doing that.
I was late. I'm just...

618
00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:15.033 line:82%
All right, I'm putting an end to this.
Interview over.

619
00:42:15.116 --> 00:42:19.871 line:82%
Okay, people, time to listen to some music
Salaam Namaste 101.5 FM. Stay tuned.

620
00:42:19.955 --> 00:42:23.416 line:82%
Lovely, mind-blowing! Amazing!

621
00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:27.837 line:82%
- Amby, listen to me.
- Go away.

622
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:31.091 line:82%
But what have I done?
Why are you so angry?

623
00:42:31.174 --> 00:42:32.550 line:82%
How long have you known me?

624
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:35.220 line:82%
- For five days.
- Five days?

625
00:42:35.303 --> 00:42:37.264 line:82%
Well, I'm counting two days
on the phone as well.

626
00:42:37.347 --> 00:42:39.140 line:82%
Listen, you don't even know me.

627
00:42:39.224 --> 00:42:40.308 line:82%
I do.

628
00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:42.435 line:82%
Really? What do you know about me?

629
00:42:42.519 --> 00:42:46.398 line:82%
Well... that you're an RJ,
studying to be a surgeon.

630
00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:49.401 line:82%
You're very beautiful,
you dance very well,

631
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:55.573 line:82%
you're superb at playing volleyball,
you hate latecomers and I love you.

632
00:42:56.408 --> 00:43:00.912 line:82%
- You... you can't be in love with me.
- Why? What's wrong with you?

633
00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:04.582 line:82%
With me? Nothing's wrong with me,
the problem's with you.

634
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:06.460 line:82%
Go, get your head checked.

635
00:43:06.544 --> 00:43:09.504 line:82%
- You think a two-day acquaintance is love!
- What else do you call this?

636
00:43:09.591 --> 00:43:12.590 line:82%
Ever since I've met you, I haven't been
able to think of anything else.

637
00:43:13.466 --> 00:43:15.635 line:82%
And don't tell me you don't feel it too.

638
00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:19.222 line:82%
Yesterday, there was something between us.
And there still is, today.

639
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:21.725 line:82%
Yes, there is. But it can't be love.

640
00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:25.812 line:82%
Why? Amby, listen... excuse me. Yes?

641
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:29.691 line:82%
- Hello?
- What? Oh, crap. I'm on my way.

642
00:43:29.816 --> 00:43:31.109 line:82%
I'm coming.

643
00:43:35.363 --> 00:43:37.615 line:82%
You told me to get married, right?
It's all your fault.

644
00:43:37.699 --> 00:43:41.202 line:82%
You were the one who told me
to go around dropping handkerchiefs.

645
00:43:43.663 --> 00:43:46.958 line:82%
This is what happens
when you make rash decisions.

646
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.336 line:82%
- Fall in love in a day...
- Five days.

647
00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:51.588 line:82%
Get married in two. Is it a joke?

648
00:43:51.672 --> 00:43:53.465 line:82%
You know nothing about each other,

649
00:43:53.548 --> 00:43:56.051 line:82%
and you decide to spend
the rest of your lives together.

650
00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:58.595 line:82%
- Really stupid.
- Yes, he is.

651
00:43:58.678 --> 00:44:00.263 line:82%
Who's talking about marriage?

652
00:44:00.472 --> 00:44:03.186 line:82%
If we need to get to know
each other, let's do that.

653
00:44:03.269 --> 00:44:06.102 line:82%
If we need to understand each other,
let's spend time together.

654
00:44:06.186 --> 00:44:08.605 line:82%
And all this because
I play volleyball well?

655
00:44:08.688 --> 00:44:12.233 line:82%
No. Because maybe this is love,
and maybe not.

656
00:44:12.525 --> 00:44:16.570 line:82%
Unless we give this feeling
a chance how will we find out?

657
00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:19.950 line:82%
- It won't work Nick.
- I know, it just won't work, Nick.

658
00:44:20.034 --> 00:44:21.034 line:82%
Why?

659
00:44:21.117 --> 00:44:22.619 line:82%
Because he's a pig.

660
00:44:23.578 --> 00:44:25.997 line:82%
By the time you wake up,
I'm at the radio station.

661
00:44:26.456 --> 00:44:28.708 line:82%
You work at the restaurant
from afternoon to night.

662
00:44:28.792 --> 00:44:32.712 line:82%
I'm in college, then I'm studying.
How do we meet? Where's the time Nick?

663
00:44:32.796 --> 00:44:33.880 line:82%
So...

664
00:44:35.757 --> 00:44:37.384 line:82%
- so, let's live together.
- What?

665
00:44:37.467 --> 00:44:39.219 line:82%
Yes. Think about it...

666
00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:42.055 line:82%
you live in the hostel alone,
and I live alone.

667
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.151 line:82%
Let's live together.

668
00:44:43.234 --> 00:44:44.234 line:82%
What's he saying?

669
00:44:44.317 --> 00:44:46.393 line:82%
I'm saying Amby and I
should live together.

670
00:44:46.476 --> 00:44:49.104 line:82%
- That way we...
- You're talking about yourselves!

671
00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.272 line:82%
Cathy, wait.

672
00:44:51.356 --> 00:44:54.150 line:82%
Nick, no. I'm not going to live with you.

673
00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:57.529 line:82%
Why? You said we don't have the time
to see each other.

674
00:44:57.612 --> 00:45:01.408 line:82%
This way we'll get the chance to spend
some time together, live together.

675
00:45:01.491 --> 00:45:05.078 line:82%
Nick, we just met three days ago.
How can I live with you?

676
00:45:05.745 --> 00:45:09.749 line:82%
So should we let go of our feelings
because our work schedules don't match?

677
00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:16.339 line:82%
Look, Amby, I don't know what we have
between us. But I want to know...

678
00:45:16.756 --> 00:45:20.468 line:82%
because if this is love,
then I don't want to lose it.

679
00:45:20.553 --> 00:45:21.928 line:82%
No, Nick.

680
00:45:22.804 --> 00:45:27.140 line:82%
Hey, wait a minute...
you're not thinking. Listen...

681
00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:28.601 line:82%
We'll have separate rooms.

682
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:32.272 line:82%
I don't mean living together like...
you're not thinking that, are you?

683
00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:33.648 line:82%
I don't mean that.

684
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:37.026 line:82%
- Just what do you mean, Nick?
- I'll tell you.

685
00:45:37.113 --> 00:45:41.030 line:82%
We'll live in the same house, we'll eat
breakfast together, watch TV together,

686
00:45:41.114 --> 00:45:43.950 line:82%
and we'll share the chores.
Then you'll find out

687
00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:47.537 line:82%
what I'm actually like,
how I live at home, when I wake up...

688
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.872 line:82%
In the afternoon.

689
00:45:48.955 --> 00:45:50.540 line:82%
Very funny, but listen...

690
00:45:50.623 --> 00:45:54.752 line:82%
I'll find out what you're like, what you
like doing, what your problems are...

691
00:45:54.836 --> 00:45:57.250 line:82%
the shows you like watching,
games you like playing.

692
00:45:57.333 --> 00:45:58.940 line:82%
- You like scrabble?
- I love scrabble.

693
00:45:59.023 --> 00:46:00.508 line:82%
See? I can't play scrabble.

694
00:46:00.592 --> 00:46:03.428 line:82%
My spelling sucks. Monopoly?

695
00:46:04.304 --> 00:46:07.390 line:82%
And think about it,
you'll never need to cook.

696
00:46:08.558 --> 00:46:10.852 line:82%
Nick, it's too hasty.

697
00:46:11.436 --> 00:46:12.687 line:82%
Maybe.

698
00:46:12.929 --> 00:46:18.943 line:82%
But if we can't tolerate each other,
then we just go our separate ways. Simple.

699
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:23.114 line:82%
It's not so simple, Nick.

700
00:46:24.032 --> 00:46:25.241 line:82%
I'm sorry.

701
00:46:27.076 --> 00:46:28.161 line:82%
Fine.

702
00:46:30.163 --> 00:46:31.206 line:82%
Fine.

703
00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:34.876 line:82%
Maybe you're right.
Maybe there's nothing between us.

704
00:46:35.585 --> 00:46:37.462 line:82%
And even if there is, it'll go away.

705
00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:39.339 line:82%
Life moves on.

706
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:43.760 line:82%
But ten years later,
when you wake up one morning,

707
00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:47.388 line:82%
to find a fat,
rich doctor snoring next to you,

708
00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:51.726 line:82%
won't you ask yourself,
"Was there something there?"

709
00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:56.898 line:82%
"Could something have happened?"
But then, there will be no answer.

710
00:46:57.774 --> 00:47:00.652 line:82%
Because you didn't give it a chance.

711
00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:05.782 line:82%
Maybe Nick and Ambar could've
been something, maybe not...

712
00:47:06.115 --> 00:47:07.742 line:82%
but we'll never find out.

713
00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:22.173 line:82%
Amby! Amby, it's Ron.
He's calling on the phone.

714
00:47:22.257 --> 00:47:24.342 line:82%
What do I do? Come.

715
00:47:34.978 --> 00:47:37.564 line:82%
- Hello?
- I won't ever have to cook?

716
00:47:37.648 --> 00:47:38.648 line:82%
What?

717
00:47:38.731 --> 00:47:40.650 line:82%
I won't ever have to cook?

718
00:47:40.733 --> 00:47:42.944 line:82%
Never. Not an omelette,
not even a cup of tea.

719
00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:44.487 line:82%
And separate rooms?

720
00:47:44.571 --> 00:47:46.036 line:82%
Far away from each other.

721
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.947 line:82%
- Okay.
- So, should we start looking for a house?

722
00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:53.621 line:82%
- Wow.
- Control yourself.

723
00:47:53.705 --> 00:47:55.123 line:82%
Let's talk this over first.

724
00:48:07.677 --> 00:48:10.263 line:82%
I don't trust Indians.

725
00:48:10.722 --> 00:48:12.223 line:82%
What's that?

726
00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:19.185 line:82%
Babes, what I always say about Indians?

727
00:48:19.682 --> 00:48:20.690 line:82%
Sorry?

728
00:48:20.773 --> 00:48:26.696 line:82%
Exactly. Means, I don't trust the Indians.

729
00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:35.330 line:82%
Hating Jaggu Yadav was,
is and always will be very easy.

730
00:48:37.332 --> 00:48:42.128 line:82%
After migrating from Bihar to Mumbai,
it seemed he'd never make it.

731
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.293 line:82%
He kept getting pushed around
from one place to the next.

732
00:48:45.381 --> 00:48:47.842 line:82%
Someone suggested going abroad
and driving a cab.

733
00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:50.678 line:82%
And so he arrived in Melbourne.
Then he won the lottery.

734
00:48:50.762 --> 00:48:54.223 line:82%
His luck took a turn for the better,
but his personality stayed the same.

735
00:48:54.307 --> 00:48:58.436 line:82%
Hopefully you won't like him too much,
because he definitely doesn't like you.

736
00:49:03.524 --> 00:49:05.485 line:82%
But you're Indian yourself, and...

737
00:49:07.779 --> 00:49:11.282 line:82%
I was Indian. Was.

738
00:49:11.574 --> 00:49:14.661 line:82%
Now, I'm Australian.

739
00:49:15.203 --> 00:49:18.581 line:82%
- Get it, mate?
- Got it.

740
00:49:18.665 --> 00:49:21.084 line:82%
There are two kinds of Indians.

741
00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:24.337 line:82%
Babes, what the two kinds of Indians are?

742
00:49:24.426 --> 00:49:25.426 line:82%
Sorry?

743
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:30.718 line:82%
Exactly. One, the kind you can't trust.

744
00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:34.847 line:82%
And two, the kind you can't tolerate.

745
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:41.020 line:82%
Look, we just want to rent your house.
We don't want to cause any problems.

746
00:49:41.854 --> 00:49:46.150 line:82%
I see that, I see that.
I can see you're okay.

747
00:49:46.234 --> 00:49:49.195 line:82%
Nice, married couple.

748
00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:53.865 line:82%
Married couples I trust.
When did you get married?

749
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.785 line:82%
- Soon.
- A week ago.

750
00:49:57.745 --> 00:50:01.666 line:82%
We thought it would happen soon,
then a week ago it suddenly happened.

751
00:50:01.874 --> 00:50:06.003 line:82%
Quick engagement,
instant marriage. And kids?

752
00:50:07.088 --> 00:50:09.924 line:82%
There wasn't really much time or
they would've happened as well.

753
00:50:15.603 --> 00:50:17.390 line:82%
Funny guys.

754
00:50:17.974 --> 00:50:21.352 line:82%
Senses of humor. I like that.

755
00:50:21.978 --> 00:50:24.272 line:82%
Come, let me show you the house.

756
00:50:28.943 --> 00:50:30.069 line:82%
Babes.

757
00:50:36.784 --> 00:50:38.870 line:82%
Home, the sweets home.

758
00:50:57.597 --> 00:50:58.681 line:82%
What?

759
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:05.521 line:82%
What are you looking for?

760
00:51:05.605 --> 00:51:09.317 line:82%
Nothing. Just checking to see if it opens.

761
00:51:10.902 --> 00:51:16.032 line:82%
This is not an Indian public bathroom
where things that are closed don't open,

762
00:51:16.115 --> 00:51:18.367 line:82%
and things that are open don't close.

763
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:20.620 line:82%
This is Australia, mate.

764
00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.791 line:82%
Open. Close. Okay, mate?

765
00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:26.709 line:82%
Where's the other bathroom?

766
00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:32.340 line:82%
Another bathroom? What for?

767
00:51:32.425 --> 00:51:35.551 line:82%
- Just in case we have guests over...
- No guests.

768
00:51:35.927 --> 00:51:39.180 line:82%
I do not want any guests in here.

769
00:51:39.265 --> 00:51:42.892 line:82%
Looks here. Just the twos of you.

770
00:51:43.643 --> 00:51:47.980 line:82%
Babes. Tell them how much I hate guests.

771
00:51:48.383 --> 00:51:49.442 line:82%
Sorry?

772
00:51:49.525 --> 00:51:54.654 line:82%
Exactly.
Whether you agree or not, no guests.

773
00:51:57.824 --> 00:52:00.368 line:82%
So, you are wanting the house?

774
00:52:01.077 --> 00:52:03.996 line:82%
- Just a second.
- No second, only first.

775
00:52:04.288 --> 00:52:07.875 line:82%
Nice house, but this Crocodile Dundee
is making me nervous.

776
00:52:07.959 --> 00:52:11.546 line:82%
It's not like we have to live with him.
Nice rooms. I want the bigger one.

777
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:15.049 line:82%
The kitchen's quite cool as well.
Let me talk to him.

778
00:52:15.967 --> 00:52:18.052 line:82%
Crap! You scared me.

779
00:52:18.344 --> 00:52:23.891 line:82%
I have that effect on the peoples.
It's my personality.

780
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:27.436 line:82%
So, you wanting the house?

781
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.605 line:82%
Well, okay.

782
00:52:29.981 --> 00:52:31.941 line:82%
One year's rents in advance.

783
00:52:32.024 --> 00:52:33.109 line:82%
What?

784
00:52:33.901 --> 00:52:37.113 line:82%
Translates, read my lips.

785
00:52:37.405 --> 00:52:40.157 line:82%
I need one year's rent in advance.

786
00:52:40.533 --> 00:52:44.662 line:82%
Babes. Don't I always take
the rents in the advance?

787
00:52:44.997 --> 00:52:45.997 line:82%
Sorry?

788
00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.416 line:82%
- Exactly!
- But why?

789
00:52:49.834 --> 00:52:52.879 line:82%
- Short term memories?
- Memories?

790
00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:57.341 line:82%
I don't trust Indians.

791
00:53:02.013 --> 00:53:03.931 line:82%
One year's rent in advance!

792
00:53:04.015 --> 00:53:06.726 line:82%
- Is it his dad's house?
- No, it's his.

793
00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:11.397 line:82%
- And where will you get the money?
- I cashed in my bonds.

794
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.565 line:82%
What?

795
00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:16.332 line:82%
Nick, you saved that money
to start your own restaurant.

796
00:53:16.425 --> 00:53:17.528 line:82%
I know.

797
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:23.034 line:82%
- And how is Ambar getting the money?
- She's taking a loan against her salary.

798
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.329 line:82%
I hope you guys know what you're doing.

799
00:53:26.412 --> 00:53:29.081 line:82%
- All this is happening so fast...
- Look who's talking.

800
00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:32.543 line:82%
One afternoon you meet five girls.
Next morning you marry one.

801
00:53:32.627 --> 00:53:35.880 line:82%
And I'm regretting it now.
You don't know these girls.

802
00:53:36.172 --> 00:53:39.759 line:82%
First, their logic switch
is permanently off.

803
00:53:40.009 --> 00:53:44.472 line:82%
And if they ever switch it on by mistake,
the regulator always stays at zero.

804
00:53:47.767 --> 00:53:49.060 line:82%
But that's true.

805
00:53:54.056 --> 00:53:56.067 line:82%
Amby, where do you want...

806
00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:02.865 line:82%
- Has all the stuff arrived?
- Yup, everything.

807
00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:10.334 line:82%
Is this... staying up there?

808
00:54:10.418 --> 00:54:11.582 line:82%
Yes, why?

809
00:54:12.058 --> 00:54:14.210 line:82%
No. It's very nice.

810
00:54:18.281 --> 00:54:21.133 line:82%
You're right. I'll put it up
in my bedroom.

811
00:54:21.689 --> 00:54:23.094 line:82%
- Thanks.
- Nick!

812
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:24.679 line:82%
We are moving back together.

813
00:54:27.682 --> 00:54:30.977 line:82%
- Are you okay, podgy?
- I'm all right, okay.

814
00:54:32.138 --> 00:54:33.165 line:82%
Amby, guess what.

815
00:54:33.259 --> 00:54:34.939 line:82%
You okay, podgy?

816
00:54:35.898 --> 00:54:40.361 line:82%
- So, she turned her logic switch on?
- No, I turned mine off.

817
00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:44.407 line:82%
- Thought so. So the divorce is cancelled?
- Absolutely. Cancel, cancel, cancel.

818
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:45.781 line:82%
- Until when?
- Forever.

819
00:54:45.866 --> 00:54:49.412 line:82%
Still, keep a room for me. You never know
when she'll kick me out.

820
00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:52.248 line:82%
- Sorry, buddy, that's Ambar's room.
- What do you mean?

821
00:54:52.623 --> 00:54:55.920 line:82%
Which word didn't you understand,
Ambar or room?

822
00:54:56.013 --> 00:55:00.089 line:82%
I didn't understand anything.
Dude! You'll live in separate rooms?

823
00:55:01.382 --> 00:55:03.467 line:82%
What's he saying in Hindi?
Is he laughing at me?

824
00:55:03.551 --> 00:55:05.134 line:82%
Yes, he's being very rude.

825
00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:08.841 line:82%
They're living here together, but
in different rooms. Can you believe it?

826
00:55:08.925 --> 00:55:11.100 line:82%
Podgy-wodgy, stop it!

827
00:55:11.183 --> 00:55:14.812 line:82%
You guys can go to your separate rooms,
we're going to our single room.

828
00:55:15.853 --> 00:55:18.482 line:82%
- All right guys, see you, man.
- Bye.

829
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.363 line:82%
Living separately, can you believe it?
Two different rooms! Unbelievable!

830
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:30.578 line:82%
Today's the first day so
you don't have to cook dinner.

831
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:32.420 line:82%
- Wow, thanks boss.
- Shall we order in?

832
00:55:32.507 --> 00:55:37.710 line:82%
Sure. What do you feel like having?
Chinese? Mexican? Indian?

833
00:55:37.929 --> 00:55:42.173 line:82%
Pizza. A nice, hot, crispy, yummy pizza.

834
00:55:42.465 --> 00:55:45.958 line:82%
My mouth's watering. You don't like pizza?

835
00:55:46.043 --> 00:55:49.019 line:82%
- No, it's not that. I...
- Forget it, let's get something else.

836
00:55:49.226 --> 00:55:52.157 line:82%
No, I'm fine with pizza.
I've had pizza. I...

837
00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.204 line:82%
Nick, you don't have
to like everything that I do.

838
00:55:57.897 --> 00:55:59.523 line:82%
But I like pizza.

839
00:56:01.445 --> 00:56:06.864 line:82%
- I owe you three dollars.
- You had only one slice, so one dollar.

840
00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:08.240 line:82%
Okay.

841
00:56:08.918 --> 00:56:10.785 line:82%
Let's settle accounts on Sunday?

842
00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.411 line:82%
Fine.

843
00:56:12.495 --> 00:56:14.323 line:82%
And this one's my treat.

844
00:56:14.408 --> 00:56:16.582 line:82%
Wow. Thank you.

845
00:56:16.877 --> 00:56:18.167 line:82%
What do I get?

846
00:56:20.086 --> 00:56:21.337 line:82%
One second.

847
00:56:21.545 --> 00:56:24.799 line:82%
Ambar, meet Romeo. Romeo, meet Ambar.

848
00:56:25.084 --> 00:56:28.400 line:82%
- Romeo says hi.
- Hi Romeo. Where's Juliet?

849
00:56:28.483 --> 00:56:34.100 line:82%
In my room. But don't worry Romeo, nothing
will happen between us in your absence.

850
00:56:34.428 --> 00:56:37.388 line:82%
I don't think he's listening to you.
He's checking me out.

851
00:56:37.473 --> 00:56:40.119 line:82%
I was afraid of that. Behave yourself!

852
00:56:40.206 --> 00:56:44.068 line:82%
If Romeo misbehaves with me,
it's going to be your fault.

853
00:56:44.397 --> 00:56:47.947 line:82%
Come on Romeo, let's get to know
each other. Say good night to Nick.

854
00:56:48.456 --> 00:56:49.951 line:82%
Are you going to sleep?

855
00:56:50.034 --> 00:56:52.144 line:82%
I've got to go to the radio station
in the morning.

856
00:56:53.077 --> 00:56:55.406 line:82%
Okay, I'll clean this up.

857
00:56:55.496 --> 00:56:57.248 line:82%
Leave it. We'll clean up in the morning.

858
00:57:01.794 --> 00:57:05.214 line:82%
Let me guess, if we don't clean up now,
you won't be able to sleep all night?

859
00:57:05.297 --> 00:57:08.300 line:82%
No, no, nothing like that.
We'll do it in the morning.

860
00:57:09.718 --> 00:57:10.719 line:82%
Where are you going?

861
00:57:10.803 --> 00:57:14.807 line:82%
If you can tolerate my pizza,
I can definitely tolerate cleaning up.

862
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:20.020 line:82%
My sister got married when she was 18.

863
00:57:20.287 --> 00:57:23.440 line:82%
By the time she was my age,
she had two kids.

864
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.654 line:82%
I saw her life. Household chores,
cooking, looking after the kids.

865
00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:34.494 line:82%
- Weren't you being forced to marry?
- Of course. "You're a graduate now.

866
00:57:34.577 --> 00:57:37.496 line:82%
All the nice boys will get married.
It's our last responsibility."

867
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.123 line:82%
I got all of that.

868
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.710 line:82%
- You fought with them and came here?
- Yes.

869
00:57:43.085 --> 00:57:46.088 line:82%
Four years ago. Dad was very angry.

870
00:57:46.964 --> 00:57:50.968 line:82%
I think Mom understands, but she
doesn't have the courage to speak out.

871
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:57.433 line:82%
- Do you talk to them?
- Mom calls me secretly, sometimes.

872
00:57:58.106 --> 00:58:00.579 line:82%
But I haven't heard
Dad's voice in four years.

873
00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:04.732 line:82%
I've got only one life Nick.
I want to live it for myself.

874
00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:07.651 line:82%
Believe me, I understand.

875
00:58:09.445 --> 00:58:12.323 line:82%
- Done. Can I go to sleep now?
- Sure.

876
00:58:20.164 --> 00:58:22.436 line:82%
I hope at least some of our habits match.

877
00:58:22.523 --> 00:58:23.792 line:82%
They will.

878
00:58:24.168 --> 00:58:25.920 line:82%
I can't believe you don't like pizza.

879
00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:29.131 line:82%
I like pizza. Sometimes.

880
00:58:35.221 --> 00:58:37.223 line:82%
- Good night.
- Good night.

881
00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.907 line:82%
You don't need to lock the door.

882
00:58:55.579 --> 00:58:57.660 line:82%
If I doubted you,
I wouldn't be living with you.

883
00:59:00.412 --> 00:59:02.081 line:82%
- Good night.
- Good night.

884
00:59:14.218 --> 00:59:16.971 line:82%
Keep it low. You'll wake up
that Crocodile Dundee.

885
00:59:17.054 --> 00:59:19.807 line:82%
I swear. What a guy.

886
00:59:20.015 --> 00:59:22.140 line:82%
And that strange girl who stays with him.

887
00:59:22.226 --> 00:59:23.477 line:82%
"What's that?"

888
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.560 line:82%
"Sorry?"

889
00:59:24.643 --> 00:59:26.230 line:82%
"Exactly."

890
00:59:28.482 --> 00:59:30.025 line:82%
Ambar?

891
00:59:30.693 --> 00:59:32.444 line:82%
I still think I love you.

892
00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:34.280 line:82%
Tell me in the morning.

893
00:59:44.832 --> 00:59:45.916 line:82%
Hi.

894
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:48.794 line:82%
Hi.

895
00:59:50.581 --> 00:59:51.588 line:82%
Stop staring.

896
00:59:51.672 --> 00:59:52.715 line:82%
Sorry.

897
00:59:54.091 --> 00:59:55.624 line:82%
How come you're up so early?

898
00:59:55.945 --> 00:59:57.678 line:82%
Thanks to a whole lot of alarms.

899
00:59:57.896 --> 00:59:58.896 line:82%
Why?

900
00:59:58.979 --> 01:00:01.184 line:82%
So I could see you go from
the bathroom to the bedroom.

901
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.350 line:82%
Right.

902
01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:05.144 line:82%
You know something...

903
01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:08.063 line:82%
you look beautiful.

904
01:00:08.147 --> 01:00:09.440 line:82%
Thank you.

905
01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:11.692 line:82%
And you smell great.

906
01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:16.447 line:82%
Thank you. Now I'm shy,
and I'm going to go to my room.

907
01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:18.532 line:82%
Listen.

908
01:00:19.033 --> 01:00:20.576 line:82%
Have you got ten minutes?

909
01:00:21.813 --> 01:00:22.853 line:82%
Why?

910
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.123 line:82%
Tell me. Just ten minutes?

911
01:00:28.876 --> 01:00:29.960 line:82%
Yes.

912
01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:31.837 line:82%
Good. Come with me.

913
01:00:33.143 --> 01:00:35.466 line:82%
I can't believe you woke up
just to make me breakfast.

914
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:38.761 line:82%
Well, breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

915
01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.056 line:82%
You'll eat a proper
breakfast every day now.

916
01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:43.849 line:82%
Think about it.

917
01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:47.484 line:82%
- You'll have to get up early every day.
- I'll get used to it.

918
01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.192 line:82%
- Oh God, I'm really late.
- Wait.

919
01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:55.986 line:82%
Have you got ten seconds?

920
01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.991 line:82%
I've got to go. Bye!

921
01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.162 line:82%
Frustrated yet smiling.

922
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.714 line:82%
I just don't understand women, dude!

923
01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:18.884 line:82%
I mean, if you don't want an answer
then why ask the question?

924
01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:21.428 line:82%
It's unbelievable.
Three times I've told her,

925
01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:24.348 line:82%
"No, you haven't put on weight!"
And then she started up again...

926
01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.642 line:82%
"Say you swear, say you swear." So I said,

927
01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:29.686 line:82%
"It's okay if you've put on a few pounds.
Doesn't matter to me."

928
01:01:29.781 --> 01:01:31.855 line:82%
- Ooh, wrong answer.
- I know, I know.

929
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:35.068 line:82%
That's where the whole fight began.
And then our families got involved.

930
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:36.151 line:82%
How come?

931
01:01:36.235 --> 01:01:38.320 line:82%
We started insulting each other's family.

932
01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:39.822 line:82%
What?

933
01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:42.157 line:82%
And you won't believe
what she did after that.

934
01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:44.451 line:82%
She bloody started throwing
biscuits at me, dude.

935
01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:48.372 line:82%
And not the whole packet.
She was throwing them one by one.

936
01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:49.832 line:82%
Crap! So what did you do?

937
01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:53.001 line:82%
Ate them all.
She kept throwing and I kept eating.

938
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.461 line:82%
What?

939
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.547 line:82%
I know it sounds funny.

940
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:59.466 line:82%
When you're angry it all makes sense.

941
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:02.219 line:82%
- Then?
- Then, she ran out of biscuits

942
01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.595 line:82%
and began crying,

943
01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:07.599 line:82%
"I want to go to my mom's house, I
don't love you, I don't want to be here."

944
01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:10.602 line:82%
So I thought it's Thursday night,
boys' night out, let her go.

945
01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:14.273 line:82%
I'll apologize tomorrow. Besides,
what would she do here anyway?

946
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:16.275 line:82%
You should've called her.

947
01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:20.904 line:82%
Nick! Boys' night out!
You and me are boys!

948
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:24.408 line:82%
And I'm married to Cathy.
I know, she's not a boy.

949
01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.244 line:82%
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

950
01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:29.788 line:82%
Hi. What are you doing here?

951
01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.666 line:82%
Why? Nick asked me to come.

952
01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:37.087 line:82%
- It's our boys' night out.
- She was at Simone's, around the corner.

953
01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:39.006 line:82%
I said we'll go home together.

954
01:02:39.214 --> 01:02:41.133 line:82%
Why? Is there a problem?

955
01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.218 line:82%
- No.
- No, no problem at all, just that

956
01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:47.514 line:82%
if I'd known you'd be here, I'd have
asked Cathy too for the boy's night out.

957
01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:51.560 line:82%
- How was your day?
- College was bad.

958
01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.729 line:82%
- You want some sushi?
- No, thanks.

959
01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.689 line:82%
Listen, have I put on weight?

960
01:02:56.106 --> 01:03:00.777 line:82%
Put on? I think you need
to gain a few pounds.

961
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:02.613 line:82%
Really?

962
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.494 line:82%
The goods mornings.

963
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.579 line:82%
Goods morning.

964
01:03:10.663 --> 01:03:12.039 line:82%
I likes.

965
01:03:12.915 --> 01:03:15.292 line:82%
You're learning how
to speak correct English.

966
01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:19.463 line:82%
When in the Rome, do the Romans.

967
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.049 line:82%
By way, where the goings?

968
01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.384 line:82%
I'm going to work.

969
01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:27.554 line:82%
Damn goods you work.

970
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.891 line:82%
I like working women a lot.

971
01:03:30.978 --> 01:03:35.062 line:82%
Babes, what I always say
about woman working?

972
01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:37.314 line:82%
Sorry?

973
01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.982 line:82%
Exactly.

974
01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:43.111 line:82%
You misses the spots there.

975
01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:44.947 line:82%
Sorry?

976
01:03:45.043 --> 01:03:49.117 line:82%
"Sorry, sorry!"
You missed the bloody spots there.

977
01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:53.212 line:82%
You are wanting the Dundee daddies
to give you the spanking on your bums?

978
01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:02.005 line:82%
Ghost of the kicks not listening to talks.

979
01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:06.343 line:82%
So where's the husbands?

980
01:04:06.553 --> 01:04:07.553 line:82%
Sorry?

981
01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:12.641 line:82%
Exactly. Your husbands. The Nicks.

982
01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.061 line:82%
The Nicks. He's sleeping.

983
01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:20.899 line:82%
Wife working, husband jerking.

984
01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:22.651 line:82%
Sleeping.

985
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.070 line:82%
Same to same.

986
01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:28.615 line:82%
Okay, I'm running late for work.
Have a good day.

987
01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:31.868 line:82%
I don't play with dolls.

988
01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:33.579 line:82%
Husbands?

989
01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:38.542 line:82%
- Amby! Hey, Amby.
- Yes, my dear Jignesh.

990
01:04:38.834 --> 01:04:41.086 line:82%
What are you doing? Let's watch a movie.

991
01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:43.505 line:82%
- Sorry, I've got to meet Nick.
- Hello!

992
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:46.300 line:82%
Ever since this Nikhil Arora
has entered your life...

993
01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.428 line:82%
But seriously, take some
time out for your friends.

994
01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.916 line:82%
Oh, oh, my god I'm late. Must be Nick.

995
01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.266 line:82%
Hey Nick.

996
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:56.643 line:82%
- Who's this?
- This, my dear man, is Jignesh.

997
01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:58.478 line:82%
- Where's Amby?
- She's right here.

998
01:04:58.564 --> 01:05:01.940 line:82%
And if you don't mind may she
watch a movie with me, please?

999
01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:04.192 line:82%
It's her life. Why should I mind?

1000
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.362 line:82%
Hey Nick. Don't listen to him, I'm coming.

1001
01:05:07.446 --> 01:05:11.742 line:82%
No listen, that's why I called.
I won't be able to make it.

1002
01:05:12.326 --> 01:05:14.950 line:82%
I've got to make the provisions
list for this month with Dheka.

1003
01:05:15.037 --> 01:05:19.124 line:82%
- You carry on with Jignesh.
- No, no. I've got to shop for the house.

1004
01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:21.043 line:82%
- I'll see you at home.
- I'll be late.

1005
01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:22.294 line:82%
I'll be waiting.

1006
01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:56.328 line:82%
Jesus Christ!

1007
01:05:57.746 --> 01:06:01.166 line:82%
- I thought you'd be asleep by now.
- Not before you come home.

1008
01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.294 line:82%
- I'll be late every night.
- I'll get used to it.

1009
01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:08.215 line:82%
- Hey, the house looks amazing.
- Thanks.

1010
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.467 line:82%
You did all this in one day?

1011
01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.701 line:82%
Aren't the curtains too silky and satiny?

1012
01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:21.007 line:82%
And what are these candles for?
We never have power outages here.

1013
01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:23.146 line:82%
You aren't even remotely romantic.

1014
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:25.982 line:82%
That's worse.

1015
01:06:26.066 --> 01:06:28.652 line:82%
Shut up. I love these candles. Smell them.

1016
01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.822 line:82%
- What?
- Smell them. They're scented candles.

1017
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:35.409 line:82%
Sorry.

1018
01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:39.246 line:82%
- You don't like anything, do you?
- No! I love it.

1019
01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.373 line:82%
Difference number three.

1020
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:50.549 line:82%
Hello? Hey, Ron!

1021
01:06:50.634 --> 01:06:51.842 line:82%
Hi Cathy.

1022
01:06:52.801 --> 01:06:53.885 line:82%
What?

1023
01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:55.095 line:82%
That's great news!

1024
01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.471 line:82%
Are you mad?

1025
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.682 line:82%
Wow! When did you find out?

1026
01:06:58.765 --> 01:06:59.925 line:82%
What was the bloody hurry?

1027
01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:02.268 line:82%
It just happened?
Haven't you heard of protection?

1028
01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.104 line:82%
Cathy, I'm so happy for you.

1029
01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:08.650 line:82%
You don't know what you're getting into,
staying up nights, changing diapers.

1030
01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:09.735 line:82%
And, and...

1031
01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:12.946 line:82%
I know! Seeing them walk
for the first time, hearing them speak.

1032
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.449 line:82%
Ron! Your life's over.

1033
01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.951 line:82%
Cathy, this is such a bright new chapter.

1034
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.620 line:82%
I'll come and see you
in the evening. Okay? Bye!

1035
01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:23.749 line:82%
I have no words, Ron. No, I have no words.

1036
01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:27.294 line:82%
Nick!

1037
01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:30.714 line:82%
Oh, shit!

1038
01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:33.925 line:82%
No, no it's fine. Is it bleeding?

1039
01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:35.218 line:82%
Yes.

1040
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.304 line:82%
Damn it.

1041
01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:38.597 line:82%
Let me have a look.

1042
01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:41.016 line:82%
- No, no, it's all right.
- It's not all right Nick.

1043
01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:42.790 line:82%
It's a bad cut. You need to see a doctor.

1044
01:07:42.873 --> 01:07:45.312 line:82%
No! No doctor! Trust me. It's fine.

1045
01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.670 line:82%
Nick, you may need stitches...
it's really bad!

1046
01:07:47.755 --> 01:07:49.431 line:82%
Stitches? No, no, no stitches.

1047
01:07:49.535 --> 01:07:52.360 line:82%
Listen, I know my body.
It's all right. Stop all that!

1048
01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:53.904 line:82%
Nick, stop being difficult.

1049
01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:55.071 line:82%
You need a doctor.

1050
01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:58.533 line:82%
No. No doctor, please! Okay?
I don't like hospitals or doctors.

1051
01:07:58.617 --> 01:08:00.118 line:82%
I am a doctor!

1052
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:02.661 line:82%
Stop moving.

1053
01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.748 line:82%
- It'll burn.
- It won't.

1054
01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:07.626 line:82%
- It will burn.
- You won't even know.

1055
01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:08.709 line:82%
Right.

1056
01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:11.670 line:82%
Okay, shut your eyes
and think of something nice.

1057
01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:15.884 line:82%
- Like?
- Anything you like.

1058
01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:19.805 line:82%
Imagine me, in a towel...

1059
01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.766 line:82%
just coming out of the shower.

1060
01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:24.684 line:82%
Yes.

1061
01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.019 line:82%
My hair is wet.

1062
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:27.562 line:82%
Yes.

1063
01:08:27.771 --> 01:08:30.607 line:82%
The water is dripping on the carpet.

1064
01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:32.150 line:82%
Not on my carpet.

1065
01:08:33.235 --> 01:08:35.111 line:82%
You come close to me...

1066
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.657 line:82%
Very close.

1067
01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:43.078 line:82%
- And...
- And?

1068
01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.841 line:82%
- And...
- And?

1069
01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.667 line:82%
- And...
- And?

1070
01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.253 line:82%
And... it's done.

1071
01:08:53.088 --> 01:08:55.298 line:82%
- It's done.
- It's done?

1072
01:08:55.882 --> 01:08:58.510 line:82%
Hey, finish the story.

1073
01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:01.721 line:82%
Come on.

1074
01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:05.559 line:82%
You come closer to me.

1075
01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:06.935 line:82%
And?

1076
01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:08.395 line:82%
Closer.

1077
01:09:08.687 --> 01:09:09.896 line:82%
And?

1078
01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:45.096 line:82%
She walks as if she stays in heaven

1079
01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:50.240 line:82%
She looks at everybody
As if she's tolerating them

1080
01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:55.567 line:82%
But when she comes
And pretends to be angry

1081
01:09:55.901 --> 01:10:00.196 line:82%
While fighting, she smiles mistakenly

1082
01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:04.326 line:82%
My heart goes mm...

1083
01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:27.192 line:82%
When I talk to him
It seems like he's about to fall asleep

1084
01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:32.979 line:82%
After he wakes up,
It seems like he's about to cry

1085
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:38.151 line:82%
But when he quietly comes behind me
Wakes me from my reverie

1086
01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:42.656 line:82%
He takes me in his arms
And he falls down

1087
01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:46.701 line:82%
My heart goes mm...

1088
01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:25.865 line:82%
Yes, she's always saying no

1089
01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:30.912 line:82%
Yes, she's always giving me attitude

1090
01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:36.084 line:82%
Yes, she's a little stubborn

1091
01:11:37.085 --> 01:11:40.880 line:82%
Yes, she has a few gray hairs

1092
01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:47.387 line:82%
She's always swimming against the tide

1093
01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:52.434 line:82%
She troubles me with her wayward ways

1094
01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:57.375 line:82%
She always arrives early
Doesn't listen to any excuses

1095
01:11:57.772 --> 01:12:02.360 line:82%
But she always waits up for me every day

1096
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:07.198 line:82%
My heart goes mm...

1097
01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:44.986 line:82%
Yes, he cries at movies

1098
01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:50.366 line:82%
Yes, he sleeps with his mouth open

1099
01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:55.789 line:82%
Yes, he's stupid at times

1100
01:12:56.247 --> 01:13:01.002 line:82%
Yes, he deserves a good spanking

1101
01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:06.389 line:82%
God knows what he says
And what he does

1102
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.638 line:82%
Climbs on the sofa
And gets tangled in the curtains

1103
01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:16.643 line:82%
When he starts cleaning
It's a disaster

1104
01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:21.172 line:82%
But after getting tired
When he stretches

1105
01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:25.360 line:82%
My heart goes mm...

1106
01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:20.123 line:82%
Yes, she's a bit different

1107
01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:25.670 line:82%
Yes, she's sometimes wrong

1108
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.842 line:82%
Yes, he's a bit different

1109
01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:36.222 line:82%
Yes, he's sometimes wrong

1110
01:14:36.723 --> 01:14:41.311 line:82%
Never thought she'd be like this

1111
01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:46.566 line:82%
I thought he'd be like this

1112
01:14:46.774 --> 01:14:49.144 line:82%
Why do I feel like he's mine?

1113
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.946 line:82%
Is she real or a dream?

1114
01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:56.226 line:82%
I'm scared he'll disappear

1115
01:14:56.492 --> 01:15:00.288 line:82%
My heart goes mm...

1116
01:16:16.522 --> 01:16:17.615 line:82%
Ambar?

1117
01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:23.705 line:82%
Amby.

1118
01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:26.332 line:82%
Hey.

1119
01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:29.252 line:82%
Hey... what's wrong?

1120
01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:34.465 line:82%
Amby... what's this?

1121
01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:37.760 line:82%
Amby, please, talk to me.

1122
01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:39.304 line:82%
What happened?

1123
01:16:39.964 --> 01:16:41.011 line:82%
I'm pregnant.

1124
01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.181 line:82%
What?

1125
01:16:42.682 --> 01:16:43.975 line:82%
I'm pregnant.

1126
01:16:44.684 --> 01:16:47.812 line:82%
What? Are you sure?

1127
01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.481 line:82%
Completely sure?

1128
01:16:51.316 --> 01:16:54.569 line:82%
Yes. I took the test twice.
It was positive both times.

1129
01:16:54.986 --> 01:16:59.032 line:82%
Oh, crap! Crap!

1130
01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:01.367 line:82%
How could you do this?

1131
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.536 line:82%
How could I do this?

1132
01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.121 line:82%
I mean, how did this happen?

1133
01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.789 line:82%
We always use protection.

1134
01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:08.374 line:82%
- I know.
- Then?

1135
01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:11.878 line:82%
Then what, Nick? You know that
protection's not always 100 percent.

1136
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.671 line:82%
So why are you asking me?

1137
01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:14.839 line:82%
Sorry.

1138
01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:18.217 line:82%
Get rid of it.

1139
01:17:18.613 --> 01:17:19.637 line:82%
What?

1140
01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.720 line:82%
Get rid of it.

1141
01:17:20.807 --> 01:17:23.264 line:82%
You don't want this kid! I don't want it.

1142
01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:24.766 line:82%
Let's kill it.

1143
01:17:27.352 --> 01:17:32.982 line:82%
The word is abortion, Nick.
We need an abortion. Don't say kill it.

1144
01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:35.234 line:82%
What difference does it make
what we call it?

1145
01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:40.490 line:82%
We've got to do what has to be done!
Let's go now. I'll come with you.

1146
01:17:52.502 --> 01:17:53.836 line:82%
I'll stay here.

1147
01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:57.131 line:82%
You won't come with me?

1148
01:17:58.049 --> 01:18:01.636 line:82%
Amby, you know me.
Hospitals and doctors and...

1149
01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:02.845 line:82%
Fine.

1150
01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:08.974 line:82%
Come.

1151
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.770 line:82%
Hello, Mrs. Winters.

1152
01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:13.606 line:82%
We feeling good today?

1153
01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:14.816 line:82%
Excellent.

1154
01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:17.235 line:82%
This is Ambar Malhotra, a student of mine.

1155
01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:19.070 line:82%
Ambar, sit.

1156
01:18:19.155 --> 01:18:21.030 line:82%
It's fascinating to watch, you know.

1157
01:18:21.537 --> 01:18:22.590 line:82%
Excuse me.

1158
01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:30.581 line:82%
After five months, your baby
responds to voices.

1159
01:18:30.665 --> 01:18:34.252 line:82%
Look... he's responding to us!

1160
01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:39.298 line:82%
There, you see the hands taking shape.

1161
01:18:39.383 --> 01:18:42.385 line:82%
But you don't see the legs
because the body's in the way.

1162
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:45.805 line:82%
- I'm sure you can feel the legs.
- Oh yes, she can kick.

1163
01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:48.720 line:82%
- It could be a he.
- It's a she.

1164
01:18:48.808 --> 01:18:51.185 line:82%
I know it. I can just feel it.

1165
01:18:51.853 --> 01:18:54.772 line:82%
And just there, you can see
the baby's heart beating.

1166
01:18:54.856 --> 01:18:58.359 line:82%
She's so beautiful. Oh god,
I think I'm going to cry.

1167
01:19:00.153 --> 01:19:03.100 line:82%
- Judy, everything all right?
- Everything's perfect.

1168
01:19:03.184 --> 01:19:06.869 line:82%
- Great. I'll send your reports tomorrow.
- Okay great, thank you.

1169
01:19:06.952 --> 01:19:07.952 line:82%
Welcome.

1170
01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:11.956 line:82%
- Are we going home now?
- Yes. Bye-bye.

1171
01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:18.838 line:82%
It's been 20 years and yet every time
I see a new life, I still feel the same.

1172
01:19:19.881 --> 01:19:21.883 line:82%
Life giving birth to life.

1173
01:19:22.842 --> 01:19:24.343 line:82%
It really is amazing.

1174
01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:30.558 line:82%
But when it's conceived, it isn't a life.
It's just a part of your body.

1175
01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:33.102 line:82%
Well, it's a matter of perspective.

1176
01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:37.398 line:82%
I believe it's a new life
right from the moment of conception.

1177
01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:39.592 line:82%
But, maybe I'm old-fashioned.

1178
01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:41.527 line:82%
So tell me, how come you're here?

1179
01:19:42.537 --> 01:19:43.618 line:82%
I'm pregnant.

1180
01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:47.575 line:82%
Wow. Congratulations.
I didn't know you were married.

1181
01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:50.495 line:82%
I... I need an abortion.

1182
01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:04.467 line:82%
Don't worry, Ambar. With laser technology
you won't even feel the pain.

1183
01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.973 line:82%
It'll all be done in 15 minutes.
You just relax, okay?

1184
01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:28.074 line:82%
- Nick? Where are we going?
- Home. Why? Do you have to work?

1185
01:20:29.367 --> 01:20:33.621 line:82%
- I think you should rest today.
- No.

1186
01:20:34.247 --> 01:20:38.666 line:82%
I mean us. The two of us.
Where are we going?

1187
01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:41.587 line:82%
I... I don't understand.

1188
01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:44.255 line:82%
Three months ago I met a guy.

1189
01:20:44.966 --> 01:20:47.093 line:82%
When I met him,
I didn't like him too much.

1190
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.682 line:82%
Then I got to know him and I took a liking
and we started living together.

1191
01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:56.998 line:82%
And now, now I love him.

1192
01:20:57.299 --> 01:20:58.896 line:82%
I hope you're talking about me.

1193
01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:06.571 line:82%
I love you too, Amby. You know that.

1194
01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.908 line:82%
So now what? What happens now?

1195
01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:14.412 line:82%
I don't know. I haven't thought about it.

1196
01:21:14.497 --> 01:21:18.499 line:82%
I guess, with time we'll both
realize what we want.

1197
01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:21.730 line:82%
How much time?

1198
01:21:21.951 --> 01:21:23.045 line:82%
What do you mean?

1199
01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:25.673 line:82%
Nick, we started living together
for a reason.

1200
01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:28.843 line:82%
To get to know and understand each other.

1201
01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:31.847 line:82%
It wasn't a relationship...
it was the beginning of one, right?

1202
01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:33.097 line:82%
Right.

1203
01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:37.000 line:82%
So we made a beginning,
and I think it's a very good beginning.

1204
01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:39.932 line:82%
I like being with you.
You like being with me.

1205
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:42.898 line:82%
So shouldn't we think
about this relationship now?

1206
01:21:42.982 --> 01:21:44.752 line:82%
You're not talking about marriage?

1207
01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.042 line:82%
Are you?

1208
01:21:48.279 --> 01:21:49.697 line:82%
I don't know.

1209
01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:55.286 line:82%
Amby, you're the one who said that
you're not ready for marriage...

1210
01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.292 line:82%
that you can't even think about it now.

1211
01:21:57.533 --> 01:21:59.749 line:82%
Yes. I couldn't think of marriage then.

1212
01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:05.129 line:82%
I didn't know what I wanted from life.
But now I know.

1213
01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:06.797 line:82%
What do you know?

1214
01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:10.071 line:82%
That I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.

1215
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:17.224 line:82%
Ambar, I like living with you too.
And we are living together.

1216
01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:18.768 line:82%
So why all this?

1217
01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.436 line:82%
Because I love you.

1218
01:22:20.521 --> 01:22:23.773 line:82%
And maybe I want the right over your life.

1219
01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:26.275 line:82%
And I want to give you that right too.

1220
01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:30.446 line:82%
Do you still think
we don't know each other?

1221
01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:34.241 line:82%
Why are we afraid of giving
this relationship a name, Nick?

1222
01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:37.870 line:82%
Amby, listen to me.
This will complicate everything.

1223
01:22:38.079 --> 01:22:41.248 line:82%
Please, please don't ruin this.

1224
01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:45.920 line:82%
You've just been through a major trauma.

1225
01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.832 line:82%
I know this was not easy for you.

1226
01:22:48.047 --> 01:22:50.549 line:82%
Just let it be for a few days and...

1227
01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:52.328 line:82%
I didn't get the abortion.

1228
01:22:52.581 --> 01:22:53.803 line:82%
What?

1229
01:22:57.121 --> 01:23:01.727 line:82%
And then I saw the hands
and the beating of the heart.

1230
01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.522 line:82%
It was a life, Nick.

1231
01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:09.068 line:82%
Living inside that woman,
a life now inside me.

1232
01:23:11.696 --> 01:23:13.364 line:82%
I can't destroy it.

1233
01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.701 line:82%
What the... listen to yourself.

1234
01:23:16.784 --> 01:23:19.912 line:82%
What are you saying? You have a life!

1235
01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:23.165 line:82%
Your studies, your work, us damn it!

1236
01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:26.585 line:82%
You want to give it all up
just for the sake of a child?

1237
01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:32.341 line:82%
No, Nick. I didn't want this.
I'm scared too.

1238
01:23:33.801 --> 01:23:35.125 line:82%
But I can't kill it.

1239
01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:36.762 line:82%
The word is abortion!

1240
01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:43.811 line:82%
Amby, listen to me.

1241
01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:48.274 line:82%
You're ruining both our lives.
Please, don't do this.

1242
01:23:49.817 --> 01:23:51.736 line:82%
I need time to think this over.

1243
01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:57.700 line:82%
This is not just your decision, you know.
It's my life as well.

1244
01:23:57.908 --> 01:23:59.584 line:82%
And I don't want this kid.

1245
01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:01.162 line:82%
I know.

1246
01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:03.414 line:82%
And this doesn't make
any difference to you?

1247
01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.500 line:82%
Nick, do you love me?

1248
01:24:06.587 --> 01:24:08.252 line:82%
What difference does it make, Ambar?

1249
01:24:08.337 --> 01:24:11.839 line:82%
What difference does it make how much
I love you and how much you love me?

1250
01:24:12.049 --> 01:24:14.135 line:82%
I can't give you the proof that
you're asking for.

1251
01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:15.896 line:82%
I don't want to get married.

1252
01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:17.588 line:82%
I don't want this kid.

1253
01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:20.413 line:82%
No matter how many times you ask me,
nothing's going to change.

1254
01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:23.040 line:82%
You're right.

1255
01:24:23.127 --> 01:24:24.902 line:82%
We still don't understand each other.

1256
01:24:25.169 --> 01:24:28.590 line:82%
Yes! We're far from understanding!
Because I thought

1257
01:24:28.896 --> 01:24:33.277 line:82%
I was with a sensible, intelligent girl
who'd live life to the fullest.

1258
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.862 line:82%
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1259
01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:36.363 line:82%
Go to hell!

1260
01:24:36.906 --> 01:24:40.367 line:82%
You know what, I'm glad we decided
to live together first.

1261
01:24:40.868 --> 01:24:45.206 line:82%
Because right now all I can think
of is... thank God, we didn't get married.

1262
01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:52.254 line:82%
Now you listen to me.

1263
01:24:52.713 --> 01:24:56.634 line:82%
You have absolutely no responsibility
to me and this baby.

1264
01:24:57.134 --> 01:25:00.221 line:82%
You want to be free, you're free.

1265
01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:04.141 line:82%
I'll decide what I have to do now.

1266
01:25:16.737 --> 01:25:20.366 line:82%
One more thing.
You once asked me a question

1267
01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:22.827 line:82%
about whether I'd ask myself in ten years

1268
01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:25.746 line:82%
why I didn't give Nick and Ambar a chance.

1269
01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:30.709 line:82%
And the answer is yes, I would ask myself
that. I'm glad I gave us this chance.

1270
01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:34.463 line:82%
Now I will never regret
having lost something.

1271
01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:39.385 line:82%
I'm glad I discovered that
there was nothing to lose anyway.

1272
01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:21.844 line:82%
Give him some time.
I'm sure he'll feel differently.

1273
01:26:21.941 --> 01:26:24.972 line:82%
Feel differently?
The hell he'll feel differently.

1274
01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:28.058 line:82%
Don't you Cathy me!
Ron, all you guys are all the same.

1275
01:26:28.142 --> 01:26:29.476 line:82%
What did I do?

1276
01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.059 line:82%
The same, all of you! Wimps, cowards.

1277
01:26:32.142 --> 01:26:33.898 line:82%
It's all fine when it's fun and games.

1278
01:26:33.981 --> 01:26:36.525 line:82%
Everyone's laughing,
having fun, taking it easy.

1279
01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:40.070 line:82%
Then, the minute the time comes
to take just a little responsibility,

1280
01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:43.282 line:82%
- what do you do? You run.
- But did I run?

1281
01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:46.326 line:82%
- Tell me, did I run?
- You want to run, don't you?

1282
01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:49.371 line:82%
You want to run right out that door,
because we don't need you.

1283
01:26:49.455 --> 01:26:52.249 line:82%
You know that, don't you?
Frankly, we're better off without you.

1284
01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:54.043 line:82%
But what did I do?

1285
01:26:54.130 --> 01:26:58.714 line:82%
Your friend. Your best friend.
Look what he's done to my best friend.

1286
01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:00.215 line:82%
I'll talk to him.

1287
01:27:00.299 --> 01:27:02.718 line:82%
No, you won't say anything to him.

1288
01:27:02.803 --> 01:27:04.345 line:82%
Then what will you do, Ambar?

1289
01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:06.597 line:82%
Will you bloody well speak English?

1290
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.588 line:82%
Darling, I was just asking her what
she will do, where she'll stay...

1291
01:27:09.691 --> 01:27:11.185 line:82%
What do you mean where she'll stay?

1292
01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:14.647 line:82%
She'll stay with us of course!
How dare you even ask that question?

1293
01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.941 line:82%
She's got nowhere else to go.
You know what's going on?

1294
01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:20.170 line:82%
- you'll stay with us, right?
- I have no problem with it, she can stay.

1295
01:27:20.253 --> 01:27:21.859 line:82%
Ambar, you can stay as long as you like.

1296
01:27:22.697 --> 01:27:23.697 line:82%
No.

1297
01:27:23.781 --> 01:27:25.491 line:82%
No? Then what are you going to do?

1298
01:27:46.637 --> 01:27:48.472 line:82%
I paid half the rent for this house.

1299
01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:51.392 line:82%
So, for the next eight months,
this is as much my house as yours.

1300
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.060 line:82%
So I'm not going anywhere.

1301
01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:57.147 line:82%
From now on, I'll live in my room.
If you have a problem, you're free to go.

1302
01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:02.935 line:82%
Let's just try not to get
into each other's faces.

1303
01:28:03.022 --> 01:28:06.865 line:82%
Please don't keep reminding me
that you live here, too. Okay?

1304
01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:08.325 line:82%
Okay.

1305
01:28:20.004 --> 01:28:22.631 line:82%
- So, now what?
- Nothing.

1306
01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.927 line:82%
We like each other but
we want different things from life.

1307
01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:28.387 line:82%
So you'll leave her?

1308
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.305 line:82%
- Do I have a choice?
- Of course you do.

1309
01:28:30.389 --> 01:28:33.392 line:82%
- You can be with her forever.
- Where the hell was I going?

1310
01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:36.603 line:82%
I was with her,
it's not like I was running away.

1311
01:28:36.687 --> 01:28:39.088 line:82%
And if we'd stayed happy,
I would have stayed with her.

1312
01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:42.860 line:82%
So where the hell did this
forever nonsense crop up from?

1313
01:28:43.152 --> 01:28:46.697 line:82%
- So you'll never marry?
- Maybe.

1314
01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:49.136 line:82%
- And you don't want kids either?
- Definitely not.

1315
01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:51.283 line:82%
- Why?
- Why what? Marriage or kids?

1316
01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:52.745 line:82%
Marriage.

1317
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:56.915 line:82%
Ron, why do we stay with someone?

1318
01:28:57.166 --> 01:29:00.794 line:82%
Because we want to be happy, right?
But what if we don't find happiness?

1319
01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:05.049 line:82%
Will we let a piece of paper tell us
"Now live in misery, you are trapped"?

1320
01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:08.594 line:82%
You and two witnesses have signed off
on a document with forever written on it.

1321
01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:11.013 line:82%
And now, you have to live
unhappily ever after!

1322
01:29:11.096 --> 01:29:14.266 line:82%
- But why unhappy, Nick?
- Because people change Ron.

1323
01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:15.559 line:82%
Look at yourself.

1324
01:29:15.642 --> 01:29:19.646 line:82%
You used to be happy, carefree,
you'd hit on a girl whenever you saw one.

1325
01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:21.982 line:82%
I liked you. And now

1326
01:29:22.066 --> 01:29:24.318 line:82%
all you can talk about is
how you and Cathy fight.

1327
01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:27.488 line:82%
What the fight was about,
how irrational she is.

1328
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.281 line:82%
That's all you say.

1329
01:29:29.615 --> 01:29:31.992 line:82%
Not true, we have good times together.

1330
01:29:32.076 --> 01:29:35.370 line:82%
Yeah? When was the last time
you looked good for her?

1331
01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:37.915 line:82%
- What do you mean?
- I mean put on your best clothes,

1332
01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:40.959 line:82%
took her out, candle light, wine, romance?

1333
01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:43.545 line:82%
When was the last time
you took Cathy on a date?

1334
01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:46.131 line:82%
But who goes on a date after
you're married?

1335
01:29:46.215 --> 01:29:49.468 line:82%
Exactly! I want every day
to be like a first date.

1336
01:29:49.678 --> 01:29:51.542 line:82%
There was romance between Ambar and me.

1337
01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:54.930 line:82%
We had laughter, joy.
Because we lived together by choice.

1338
01:29:55.015 --> 01:29:57.810 line:82%
- It was perfect!
- Life is not perfect, Nick.

1339
01:29:57.893 --> 01:29:59.645 line:82%
Our life was, Ron.

1340
01:30:00.104 --> 01:30:04.441 line:82%
We loved to care for each other.
She'd wait up for me at night,

1341
01:30:04.525 --> 01:30:08.695 line:82%
I'd wake up early in the morning for her.
After marriage, everything changes.

1342
01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:12.783 line:82%
We'll start taking each other for granted.
The same fights, misunderstandings.

1343
01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:16.245 line:82%
"Why do you come home so late? Why don't
you wake up early? Why meet friends?"

1344
01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:18.205 line:82%
But this can happen without marriage, no?

1345
01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:21.667 line:82%
That's it. And that's when
you know it's over.

1346
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.422 line:82%
And you should always have
that freedom, to say that it's over.

1347
01:30:30.823 --> 01:30:31.843 line:82%
Hi, baby.

1348
01:30:33.137 --> 01:30:36.431 line:82%
Okay, but isn't there some other way?

1349
01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:40.352 line:82%
Of course I understand.
Of course I care about the baby.

1350
01:30:40.561 --> 01:30:45.023 line:82%
Of course I love you!
No but... can, can we think of something?

1351
01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:48.610 line:82%
Okay, all right.

1352
01:30:48.861 --> 01:30:50.487 line:82%
I love you, too.

1353
01:30:52.281 --> 01:30:53.490 line:82%
What happened?

1354
01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:59.496 line:82%
Cathy's saying that when the baby comes,
Goofy can't stay with us.

1355
01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:01.081 line:82%
Why?

1356
01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:06.587 line:82%
She's just paranoid. Allergy from the fur
or he might bite the baby.

1357
01:31:06.879 --> 01:31:08.255 line:82%
Oh, crap.

1358
01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:12.259 line:82%
I hate this, man. I love Goofy.

1359
01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:14.094 line:82%
See what I mean?

1360
01:31:14.178 --> 01:31:19.308 line:82%
Now it's all going to start.
Do's and don'ts, sacrifices, adjustments.

1361
01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:20.726 line:82%
So what?

1362
01:31:21.685 --> 01:31:26.732 line:82%
Do it then. You're the one
who's ready to play daddy.

1363
01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:29.540 line:82%
Will you take Goofy?

1364
01:31:31.111 --> 01:31:32.487 line:82%
Are you going to cry?

1365
01:32:09.316 --> 01:32:11.193 line:82%
Turn that thing down!

1366
01:32:14.506 --> 01:32:18.450 line:82%
- Will you please turn the TV off?
- I can't sleep unless I watch TV.

1367
01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:21.495 line:82%
Then keep the volume low.
You don't live here alone.

1368
01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:24.471 line:82%
Really? I thought we agreed not
to remind each other.

1369
01:32:24.565 --> 01:32:28.460 line:82%
That's right. And this idiotic volume
in the middle of the night

1370
01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:31.255 line:82%
keeps reminding me that
you live here, too, so!

1371
01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:43.100 line:82%
What the hell are you doing?

1372
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:47.604 line:82%
I paid for this TV. I'll watch it
when I want, at whatever volume I want.

1373
01:32:47.813 --> 01:32:50.065 line:82%
So, please, from now on,
don't touch my TV.

1374
01:32:50.323 --> 01:32:51.323 line:82%
Fine.

1375
01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.320 line:82%
Oh, crap, what are you doing?

1376
01:32:56.405 --> 01:32:58.532 line:82%
I pay the cable bill every month.

1377
01:32:58.615 --> 01:33:01.827 line:82%
So, please, don't attach it
to your TV from now on.

1378
01:33:47.415 --> 01:33:48.415 line:82%
Nick.

1379
01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:52.753 line:82%
Damn it, Nick, come out!

1380
01:33:54.588 --> 01:33:57.334 line:82%
This is not your drawing room
to laze about with a newspaper.

1381
01:33:58.091 --> 01:33:59.843 line:82%
Nick, how can you be so disgusting.

1382
01:33:59.926 --> 01:34:01.553 line:82%
You're drinking milk in the bathroom!

1383
01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:08.518 line:82%
Nikhil Arora, this is your last warning!
Come out!

1384
01:34:08.602 --> 01:34:11.188 line:82%
Nikhil? Right, that's it!

1385
01:34:11.271 --> 01:34:13.751 line:82%
There's no way I'm coming out now.
Do whatever you want.

1386
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.416 line:82%
- What is this?
- I feel better when I smell this soap.

1387
01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.085 line:82%
Otherwise, I'll throw up again.

1388
01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:36.254 line:82%
- This, you psycho!
- A lesson to you.

1389
01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:38.382 line:82%
Are you bloody crazy?

1390
01:34:38.465 --> 01:34:43.305 line:82%
You threw up in my cap...
in my chef's cap... crap!

1391
01:34:43.388 --> 01:34:44.388 line:82%
How could you?

1392
01:34:44.471 --> 01:34:46.932 line:82%
What could I have done?
You were housed in there.

1393
01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:48.642 line:82%
Want me to break the door down?

1394
01:34:48.725 --> 01:34:50.720 line:82%
But in my chef's cap? You're sick!

1395
01:34:50.821 --> 01:34:54.356 line:82%
Yes, you idiot! I'm sick!
It's called morning sickness.

1396
01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:57.067 line:82%
An insensitive man like
you could never understand.

1397
01:34:57.150 --> 01:34:59.319 line:82%
Why can't you comprehend
such a small thing?

1398
01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:02.864 line:82%
There is a pregnant girl living
with you in this house.

1399
01:35:02.948 --> 01:35:05.807 line:82%
Please, keep the bathroom
free as much as possible.

1400
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.078 line:82%
Why the hell should I suffer
if you want a kid?

1401
01:35:08.161 --> 01:35:09.538 line:82%
Don't I need the bathroom?

1402
01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:12.040 line:82%
You were reading the newspaper in there.

1403
01:35:12.124 --> 01:35:14.292 line:82%
- So?
- Can't you read it outside?

1404
01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:17.657 line:82%
No! I always read the newspaper
in the bathroom. It's my habit.

1405
01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:19.693 line:82%
And the milk?
Do you have to drink that in there?

1406
01:35:19.776 --> 01:35:21.925 line:82%
Yes. Without it, I don't get the pressure.

1407
01:35:24.386 --> 01:35:27.055 line:82%
So you enjoy your pressure,
and you enjoy your paper.

1408
01:35:27.139 --> 01:35:30.642 line:82%
I swear, if I don't throw up
in Juliet's bowl tomorrow,

1409
01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:31.893 line:82%
you can change my name.

1410
01:35:31.977 --> 01:35:35.897 line:82%
You just try it, you just bloody try it.

1411
01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:39.192 line:82%
You can't even imagine
what I'll do to your room after that.

1412
01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.153 line:82%
What will you do? What will you do?

1413
01:35:41.236 --> 01:35:43.613 line:82%
I... I don't know!

1414
01:35:43.698 --> 01:35:46.950 line:82%
I haven't thought about it yet.
But I'll definitely do something!

1415
01:35:47.033 --> 01:35:49.077 line:82%
Look, Nick, please try to understand.

1416
01:35:49.494 --> 01:35:52.164 line:82%
There's a pregnant girl
living with you in this house.

1417
01:35:52.247 --> 01:35:54.166 line:82%
So, please, keep the bathroom free.

1418
01:35:57.836 --> 01:36:01.673 line:82%
Okay. But on one condition.
You have to wash this.

1419
01:36:12.893 --> 01:36:18.148 line:82%
This. This is exactly
why I don't trust Indians.

1420
01:36:19.733 --> 01:36:22.861 line:82%
Babes, why I don't the trust Indians?

1421
01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:24.196 line:82%
Sorry?

1422
01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:25.572 line:82%
Exactly.

1423
01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:28.033 line:82%
Listen, we don't want to live here.

1424
01:36:28.492 --> 01:36:31.912 line:82%
So, please return the remaining rent.

1425
01:36:32.496 --> 01:36:35.916 line:82%
Can't do it, buddy boy. Just can't do it.

1426
01:36:35.999 --> 01:36:39.503 line:82%
You can keep one month's rent as notice.

1427
01:36:39.587 --> 01:36:41.087 line:82%
But return the rest at least.

1428
01:36:41.171 --> 01:36:42.964 line:82%
Why do you want
to leave the house?

1429
01:36:43.048 --> 01:36:45.926 line:82%
- Personal reasons.
- Then I can't return your money.

1430
01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:47.177 line:82%
Why?

1431
01:36:47.886 --> 01:36:49.429 line:82%
Personal reasons.

1432
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:55.268 line:82%
Look, eight months are left.
Stay, have fun, have a good time.

1433
01:36:55.644 --> 01:36:58.480 line:82%
After that, you can go wherever
you want with your wife.

1434
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:02.067 line:82%
We lied to you.

1435
01:37:02.859 --> 01:37:03.944 line:82%
Really?

1436
01:37:04.027 --> 01:37:06.696 line:82%
Yes. We're not married.

1437
01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.908 line:82%
- Now you'll have to throw us out!
- Why?

1438
01:37:09.991 --> 01:37:12.202 line:82%
Because you only want married tenants.

1439
01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:13.912 line:82%
- Who said that?
- You did!

1440
01:37:14.246 --> 01:37:19.292 line:82%
I said that I like married people
because they're idiots.

1441
01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:22.587 line:82%
And idiots aren't dangerous.

1442
01:37:23.088 --> 01:37:24.631 line:82%
Then I'm not an idiot.

1443
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:26.925 line:82%
I'm dangerous.

1444
01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:33.306 line:82%
Are you threatening me?

1445
01:37:33.598 --> 01:37:34.599 line:82%
No.

1446
01:37:35.767 --> 01:37:40.313 line:82%
Good. Because I don't like threats.

1447
01:37:40.397 --> 01:37:41.773 line:82%
Okay.

1448
01:37:45.986 --> 01:37:48.947 line:82%
Stay if you want. Leave if you want.

1449
01:37:49.531 --> 01:37:52.325 line:82%
I don't give a crocodile's arse.

1450
01:37:53.285 --> 01:37:56.037 line:82%
Babes, do I care?

1451
01:37:56.413 --> 01:37:57.664 line:82%
Sorry?

1452
01:37:57.914 --> 01:37:59.291 line:82%
Exactly.

1453
01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:04.421 line:82%
Good. Very good. You have to move on.

1454
01:38:05.171 --> 01:38:07.340 line:82%
There's nothing left in that relationship.

1455
01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:11.052 line:82%
Amby, you deserve someone much better.

1456
01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:12.929 line:82%
I know.

1457
01:38:14.151 --> 01:38:17.058 line:82%
- But you still love him.
- Yes.

1458
01:38:17.767 --> 01:38:18.852 line:82%
Why?

1459
01:38:20.178 --> 01:38:23.565 line:82%
Love isn't like a switch
that I can just turn off.

1460
01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:27.102 line:82%
It'll take time.

1461
01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:29.915 line:82%
Why? He's a coward.

1462
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.907 line:82%
He doesn't understand you,
doesn't care for you.

1463
01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:34.951 line:82%
He's troubling you instead of helping.

1464
01:38:35.035 --> 01:38:36.411 line:82%
Why do you still love him?

1465
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:40.040 line:82%
Because those three months
were the best of my life.

1466
01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:45.211 line:82%
I still can't accept the fact that
it was all a lie, a facade.

1467
01:38:46.046 --> 01:38:49.007 line:82%
The Nick that I was
in love with didn't exist.

1468
01:38:51.885 --> 01:38:53.094 line:82%
Move on, Amby.

1469
01:38:55.013 --> 01:38:56.556 line:82%
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

1470
01:38:58.475 --> 01:38:59.851 line:82%
I'm working on it.

1471
01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:08.777 line:82%
For instance, if you rearrange the letters
in mother-in-law, you get woman-Hitler.

1472
01:39:09.122 --> 01:39:11.863 line:82%
- You're kidding!
- No, I'm serious. Check it out.

1473
01:39:12.382 --> 01:39:14.240 line:82%
Wow, what a coincidence.

1474
01:39:14.591 --> 01:39:16.865 line:82%
Actually, I don't think
it's a coincidence at all.

1475
01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:20.538 line:82%
- Hey, Cathy.
- Hey, Amby. Hi.

1476
01:39:20.789 --> 01:39:24.959 line:82%
- The house looks beautiful.
- So do you. Thank you.

1477
01:39:25.043 --> 01:39:28.963 line:82%
Hey, come let me show you around
the house. You're going to love it.

1478
01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:31.299 line:82%
And this is the master bedroom.

1479
01:39:31.383 --> 01:39:32.424 line:82%
I see.

1480
01:39:37.639 --> 01:39:39.724 line:82%
What do you intend to see in this?

1481
01:39:40.725 --> 01:39:42.811 line:82%
Myself... and maybe Cathy too.

1482
01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.523 line:82%
- Wow. What a beautiful study.
- I know.

1483
01:39:46.608 --> 01:39:50.402 line:82%
- I'm sure you can't wait to use it.
- We've used it already, don't worry.

1484
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.529 line:82%
This is a very strong table.

1485
01:39:57.117 --> 01:39:58.326 line:82%
Mind-blowing, man.

1486
01:39:58.411 --> 01:40:01.663 line:82%
Check the chairs.
Vibrating chairs. I love it. Sit, sit.

1487
01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:10.505 line:82%
- Vibrating chairs are so much fun!
- While watching movies?

1488
01:40:10.714 --> 01:40:12.340 line:82%
Someday we'll do that as well.

1489
01:40:13.258 --> 01:40:16.428 line:82%
And this is where we'll be
spending a lot of our time.

1490
01:40:16.678 --> 01:40:17.971 line:82%
You got a Jacuzzi!

1491
01:40:18.054 --> 01:40:21.558 line:82%
You bet. I told Ron that if he wants
a home theater, I want a Jacuzzi.

1492
01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:23.685 line:82%
- I love blackmail.
- I know.

1493
01:40:24.769 --> 01:40:26.688 line:82%
And this is our guest bedroom.

1494
01:40:26.855 --> 01:40:29.524 line:82%
- You mean my room.
- Did you give me a room?

1495
01:40:29.611 --> 01:40:34.150 line:82%
This is my room. This is where
Cathy will send me after we fight.

1496
01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:36.656 line:82%
And this is my favorite room.

1497
01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:48.877 line:82%
Okay, and this is...

1498
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:53.006 line:82%
Ron, Mr. Smith's here.

1499
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:55.258 line:82%
My boss.
Cathy come on, let's go.

1500
01:40:55.341 --> 01:40:56.384 line:82%
Coming.

1501
01:41:44.974 --> 01:41:49.729 line:82%
Wherever you go
I will be there

1502
01:41:51.147 --> 01:41:57.111 line:82%
I'll follow you everywhere
Just like the sky above

1503
01:42:03.368 --> 01:42:08.206 line:82%
Wherever you go
I will be there

1504
01:42:09.332 --> 01:42:15.296 line:82%
I'll follow you everywhere
Just like the sky above

1505
01:43:01.384 --> 01:43:06.890 line:82%
In summer's sun
I'll be your shade

1506
01:43:07.223 --> 01:43:12.854 line:82%
If you're lonely
I'll be your shadow

1507
01:43:13.938 --> 01:43:19.569 line:82%
When in doubt
I'll provide succor

1508
01:43:20.028 --> 01:43:25.241 line:82%
With you around
I've found life at last

1509
01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:31.456 line:82%
A web of joys
You have cast

1510
01:43:32.665 --> 01:43:37.754 line:82%
Am I lost?
Or have I been found?

1511
01:43:40.256 --> 01:43:44.928 line:82%
Wherever you go
I will be there

1512
01:43:46.638 --> 01:43:52.602 line:82%
I'll follow you everywhere
Just like the sky above

1513
01:44:50.743 --> 01:44:56.416 line:82%
Let the sorrow-laden clouds
Hover over me

1514
01:44:57.208 --> 01:45:02.672 line:82%
Let the despair
Collide with me

1515
01:45:03.256 --> 01:45:08.720 line:82%
Let all that is painful
Come to me

1516
01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:14.976 line:82%
My heart used to long for someone
That I could call my own

1517
01:45:15.476 --> 01:45:20.565 line:82%
No secret too uncomfortable
To keep from him

1518
01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:27.739 line:82%
Scared to open my eyes
What if it's all a dream?

1519
01:45:29.824 --> 01:45:34.829 line:82%
Wherever you go
I will be there

1520
01:45:35.913 --> 01:45:41.878 line:82%
I'll follow you everywhere
Just like the sky above

1521
01:46:15.328 --> 01:46:16.496 line:82%
I know.

1522
01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:17.622 line:82%
It's perfect.

1523
01:46:17.705 --> 01:46:18.915 line:82%
I know.

1524
01:46:19.916 --> 01:46:21.292 line:82%
What a location, man.

1525
01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:24.170 line:82%
- Isn't it expensive?
- Distress sale.

1526
01:46:24.253 --> 01:46:25.922 line:82%
I'm getting it at half the price.

1527
01:46:28.508 --> 01:46:30.676 line:82%
Your dream restaurant, in front of you.

1528
01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:32.720 line:82%
- Finally!
- Finally.

1529
01:46:32.804 --> 01:46:37.266 line:82%
In the corner, an outdoor barbecue
and kitchen. All in full view of patrons.

1530
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:40.601 line:82%
- Waitresses?
- Of course, all in bathing suits.

1531
01:46:40.686 --> 01:46:42.647 line:82%
Yes, yes, yes.

1532
01:46:42.957 --> 01:46:44.829 line:82%
Has your loan been processed?

1533
01:46:44.912 --> 01:46:47.527 line:82%
Almost. The formalities will
be over by noon.

1534
01:46:47.652 --> 01:46:50.822 line:82%
And then, I will be the
proud owner of Nick's Boat.

1535
01:46:51.656 --> 01:46:54.117 line:82%
- Nick's Boat?
- That's the name.

1536
01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:55.218 line:82%
It's horrible.

1537
01:46:55.301 --> 01:46:57.620 line:82%
- I love it.
- I also love it.

1538
01:46:58.788 --> 01:47:01.415 line:82%
Congratulations, brother.
I'm so happy for you, man.

1539
01:47:01.624 --> 01:47:02.917 line:82%
It's my bank manager.

1540
01:47:03.376 --> 01:47:05.461 line:82%
Hello, Mr. Lehmann. Everything good?

1541
01:47:06.963 --> 01:47:10.341 line:82%
What? But I don't understand.
You said everything had been approved.

1542
01:47:10.633 --> 01:47:13.803 line:82%
Mr. Lehmann, you can't do this to me.
I was counting on you.

1543
01:47:14.512 --> 01:47:16.347 line:82%
But you have all the business plans.

1544
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:20.101 line:82%
No, I can't make such a big down payment.
I don't have that kind of cash.

1545
01:47:20.309 --> 01:47:24.272 line:82%
Mr. Lehmann, please don't do this.
That restaurant means everything to me.

1546
01:47:25.773 --> 01:47:27.984 line:82%
I mean, there must be
something you can do.

1547
01:47:31.279 --> 01:47:35.241 line:82%
Okay. Well, thanks for trying.

1548
01:47:36.993 --> 01:47:38.244 line:82%
What?

1549
01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.371 line:82%
The loan wasn't approved.

1550
01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:41.706 line:82%
Why?

1551
01:47:41.789 --> 01:47:44.208 line:82%
They need a 25 percent down payment.

1552
01:47:44.417 --> 01:47:45.626 line:82%
So?

1553
01:47:46.085 --> 01:47:48.087 line:82%
All my money's gone into the house, Ron.

1554
01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:50.173 line:82%
Mine too.

1555
01:48:00.558 --> 01:48:03.144 line:82%
Here you go, princess.
We've reached your palace.

1556
01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:05.645 line:82%
Thanks, Jignesh. I had a great time.

1557
01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:07.023 line:82%
Nice movie?

1558
01:48:08.274 --> 01:48:09.567 line:82%
Can I ask you something?

1559
01:48:11.611 --> 01:48:13.070 line:82%
Do you still love that idiot?

1560
01:48:15.615 --> 01:48:20.494 line:82%
But it doesn't hurt so much now. Besides,
I've given up hope of things changing.

1561
01:48:21.746 --> 01:48:23.122 line:82%
Is there anything I can do?

1562
01:48:23.623 --> 01:48:28.669 line:82%
- Just be there, like you always have.
- I'm always there. I love you, man.

1563
01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:40.139 line:82%
Jerk.

1564
01:48:54.111 --> 01:48:57.196 line:82%
These are all the bills
that need to be paid.

1565
01:48:57.281 --> 01:49:00.326 line:82%
Take a look and please give me
your share. I need the money.

1566
01:49:10.378 --> 01:49:12.271 line:82%
Stop it, Nick! What are you doing?

1567
01:49:12.355 --> 01:49:15.424 line:82%
From now on, the curtains I don't like
will not be hung in the living room.

1568
01:49:15.633 --> 01:49:17.510 line:82%
And I hate these damn candles.

1569
01:49:17.885 --> 01:49:21.305 line:82%
Decorate your room as you like,
I don't want to see any of this here.

1570
01:49:21.389 --> 01:49:24.308 line:82%
You're doing this just because
I asked you for my money?

1571
01:49:24.392 --> 01:49:26.352 line:82%
To hell with your money.

1572
01:49:27.436 --> 01:49:28.604 line:82%
Just take it all, okay?

1573
01:49:28.688 --> 01:49:30.398 line:82%
Account cleared. Fine?

1574
01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:33.270 line:82%
Now you do your share.
You don't do the dishes.

1575
01:49:33.359 --> 01:49:36.862 line:82%
Your pregnancy books and papers
are scattered all over the living room.

1576
01:49:36.946 --> 01:49:39.949 line:82%
Not a living room, it's a garbage dump.
I can't stand it.

1577
01:49:40.199 --> 01:49:41.701 line:82%
We should put up a sign,

1578
01:49:41.784 --> 01:49:45.538 line:82%
''Please dump all your garbage
in our living room,

1579
01:49:45.621 --> 01:49:47.123 line:82%
there's enough space''.

1580
01:49:47.707 --> 01:49:50.500 line:82%
Listen. You like cleanliness,
you clean it up.

1581
01:49:50.584 --> 01:49:52.211 line:82%
Why should I clean up your mess?

1582
01:49:52.295 --> 01:49:54.547 line:82%
- Then live with it.
- I am living with it.

1583
01:49:54.630 --> 01:49:58.634 line:82%
I've lived in this stupid house
with you for the last ten months.

1584
01:49:58.843 --> 01:50:00.011 line:82%
I'm tolerating you too.

1585
01:50:00.094 --> 01:50:03.472 line:82%
- Do you hear me complaining?
- What the hell will you complain about?

1586
01:50:03.556 --> 01:50:07.560 line:82%
- How am I bothering you?
- I have to see your face. Every day.

1587
01:50:07.643 --> 01:50:10.271 line:82%
You live in the same house.
Isn't that enough?

1588
01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:11.856 line:82%
Just get lost!

1589
01:50:11.939 --> 01:50:15.860 line:82%
I can't believe I gave up
my restaurant for this madness.

1590
01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.528 line:82%
What did you say?

1591
01:50:18.529 --> 01:50:22.824 line:82%
I wasted all my savings just
to live with you, in this house, okay?

1592
01:50:22.908 --> 01:50:25.328 line:82%
The money I had saved up
for my restaurant.

1593
01:50:25.411 --> 01:50:30.624 line:82%
It's all gone, finished, over.
For what? A living room full of your shit!

1594
01:50:30.708 --> 01:50:34.754 line:82%
Was it my idea? To live together,
to rent this house?

1595
01:50:34.837 --> 01:50:38.132 line:82%
I can't leave my bloody job
because I took out a loan for this house.

1596
01:50:38.215 --> 01:50:41.635 line:82%
I'm working and studying
in this condition.

1597
01:50:42.011 --> 01:50:46.265 line:82%
And you jerk! Instead of helping me,
you're giving me attitude?

1598
01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:50.800 line:82%
What?

1599
01:50:51.562 --> 01:50:52.580 line:82%
It kicked.

1600
01:50:52.813 --> 01:50:53.898 line:82%
What?

1601
01:50:54.690 --> 01:50:55.775 line:82%
It kicked.

1602
01:50:58.652 --> 01:51:00.112 line:82%
It's the first time.

1603
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:03.324 line:82%
I can't feel... Oh, my God!

1604
01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.242 line:82%
Yes.

1605
01:51:06.911 --> 01:51:10.373 line:82%
- Oh, crap. Again. Can you feel it?
- Of course, I can feel it.

1606
01:51:10.581 --> 01:51:12.124 line:82%
It's happening in my stomach.

1607
01:51:44.031 --> 01:51:46.158 line:82%
Four butter Naans,
one butter Dal.

1608
01:51:47.535 --> 01:51:49.203 line:82%
- Mixed vegetables, please.
- On it.

1609
01:51:49.537 --> 01:51:50.663 line:82%
One butter chicken.

1610
01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:56.210 line:82%
Something's off, boss.

1611
01:51:58.712 --> 01:51:59.922 line:82%
Something's off?

1612
01:52:02.633 --> 01:52:04.385 line:82%
- It's okay.
- Okay?

1613
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:05.594 line:82%
Just handle it, man.

1614
01:52:05.928 --> 01:52:07.221 line:82%
Sorry, sending it right away.

1615
01:52:09.765 --> 01:52:12.476 line:82%
- Done?
- Almost, boss. Garnishing okay?

1616
01:52:13.102 --> 01:52:14.687 line:82%
Looking like a mistress.

1617
01:52:15.271 --> 01:52:17.815 line:82%
Listen, are you married?

1618
01:52:18.190 --> 01:52:19.525 line:82%
- Yes.
- Any kids?

1619
01:52:19.817 --> 01:52:21.820 line:82%
One son. But my life's a living hell now.

1620
01:52:21.903 --> 01:52:22.903 line:82%
Why?

1621
01:52:22.987 --> 01:52:25.781 line:82%
He's sick at least a couple
of days every week, cries all night.

1622
01:52:25.865 --> 01:52:29.118 line:82%
Then the cost of food, clothes, toys...
I can't even afford a holiday.

1623
01:52:29.201 --> 01:52:32.788 line:82%
- Exactly. So you were happier before?
- Hundred percent! In fact,

1624
01:52:32.872 --> 01:52:35.458 line:82%
I was happier before marriage.
No tension at all.

1625
01:52:35.541 --> 01:52:38.836 line:82%
- Exactly. Then one shouldn't marry, right?
- No way.

1626
01:52:40.296 --> 01:52:41.505 line:82%
But there's one thing.

1627
01:52:41.714 --> 01:52:46.177 line:82%
Sometimes when my son smiles at me,
or grabs my finger,

1628
01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:48.471 line:82%
it feels like everything's okay.

1629
01:52:49.054 --> 01:52:53.684 line:82%
All my tensions drain away.
That feeling can only come from a kid.

1630
01:53:33.349 --> 01:53:34.850 line:82%
I think he likes you.

1631
01:53:35.768 --> 01:53:37.019 line:82%
You're having a baby?

1632
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:39.438 line:82%
- Yes.
- First baby?

1633
01:53:39.689 --> 01:53:40.689 line:82%
Yes.

1634
01:53:40.773 --> 01:53:42.566 line:82%
I think you'll make a great father.

1635
01:53:43.734 --> 01:53:46.111 line:82%
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1636
01:53:47.905 --> 01:53:49.782 line:82%
Here are the books you ordered, Nick.

1637
01:53:50.491 --> 01:53:51.575 line:82%
Thanks, John.

1638
01:54:35.619 --> 01:54:36.954 line:82%
What are you doing?

1639
01:54:37.037 --> 01:54:40.291 line:82%
- I thought it was a thief!
- Thief! Do you remember that

1640
01:54:40.374 --> 01:54:44.080 line:82%
- someone else also lives in this house?
- Yes, but you were being so quiet.

1641
01:54:44.169 --> 01:54:46.212 line:82%
You always come in,
turn on the lights, the TV.

1642
01:54:46.297 --> 01:54:47.339 line:82%
Your door was open.

1643
01:54:47.423 --> 01:54:49.049 line:82%
I was trying not to disturb you.

1644
01:54:50.009 --> 01:54:51.343 line:82%
You were tying to... what?

1645
01:54:51.427 --> 01:54:53.804 line:82%
Whatever. Now why are you awake
at this hour?

1646
01:54:53.887 --> 01:54:54.972 line:82%
I'm going out.

1647
01:54:55.472 --> 01:54:58.600 line:82%
- Now? Where?
- What do you care?

1648
01:54:58.684 --> 01:55:00.227 line:82%
Come on, take it easy.

1649
01:55:00.311 --> 01:55:03.439 line:82%
- Where are you going at 11 p.m.?
- I want to eat ice cream.

1650
01:55:04.648 --> 01:55:05.733 line:82%
No problem.

1651
01:55:06.942 --> 01:55:09.361 line:82%
Here. Ice cream.

1652
01:55:10.237 --> 01:55:13.741 line:82%
No. I want to have Ben & Jerry's
Belgian Dark Chocolate ice cream.

1653
01:55:13.824 --> 01:55:15.900 line:82%
I thought you didn't
like chocolate ice cream?

1654
01:55:15.993 --> 01:55:17.828 line:82%
Damn it, Nick, you won't understand.

1655
01:55:17.911 --> 01:55:20.600 line:82%
This happens during a pregnancy.
When you have a craving,

1656
01:55:20.683 --> 01:55:22.113 line:82%
you can't think of anything else.

1657
01:55:22.196 --> 01:55:24.793 line:82%
All I want is Ben & Jerry's
Belgian Dark Chocolate ice cream.

1658
01:55:24.877 --> 01:55:28.672 line:82%
- Okay, okay. Get it tomorrow.
- No, Nick. I want it now.

1659
01:55:28.756 --> 01:55:30.633 line:82%
What do you care? Go to sleep!

1660
01:55:30.716 --> 01:55:32.426 line:82%
Fine! Do what you want.

1661
01:55:46.982 --> 01:55:48.025 line:82%
Chocolate, right?

1662
01:55:48.108 --> 01:55:49.109 line:82%
What are you doing?

1663
01:55:49.777 --> 01:55:51.735 line:82%
You wanted chocolate ice cream, right?

1664
01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:52.946 line:82%
No, Nick.

1665
01:55:53.989 --> 01:55:57.201 line:82%
Ambar, it's really late.
Please, don't confuse me.

1666
01:55:59.078 --> 01:56:02.788 line:82%
I want Ben & Jerry's
Belgian Dark Chocolate ice cream.

1667
01:56:02.873 --> 01:56:04.750 line:82%
Where will we find
Ben & Jerry's at this hour?

1668
01:56:04.833 --> 01:56:06.740 line:82%
We'll find one.
It'll be open in St. Kilda.

1669
01:56:06.834 --> 01:56:07.904 line:82%
It'll be closed.

1670
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:09.463 line:82%
It'll be open, I know.

1671
01:56:20.057 --> 01:56:21.517 line:82%
That's impossible.

1672
01:56:22.142 --> 01:56:24.812 line:82%
I mean, how can they be shut?

1673
01:56:24.895 --> 01:56:26.522 line:82%
Are they allowed to close down?

1674
01:56:26.897 --> 01:56:31.735 line:82%
It's only what, a quarter to twelve?
The whole world wants to eat ice cream.

1675
01:56:31.819 --> 01:56:33.320 line:82%
What if it's an emergency?

1676
01:56:33.404 --> 01:56:35.989 line:82%
It could be a matter of life and death.

1677
01:56:37.324 --> 01:56:39.243 line:82%
And they're shut?

1678
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:46.375 line:82%
Okay, sorry, but where will
you find it at this hour?

1679
01:56:46.458 --> 01:56:47.751 line:82%
Have something else.

1680
01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:52.631 line:82%
- Nick, I have to have Ben...
- And Jerry's Belgian Dark Chocolate

1681
01:56:52.716 --> 01:56:57.094 line:82%
- ice cream. I know, I know. But where?
- I don't care.

1682
01:56:59.805 --> 01:57:01.348 line:82%
What's going on, man?

1683
01:57:28.167 --> 01:57:32.421 line:82%
Quarter to midnight
Two souls on a roll

1684
01:57:32.504 --> 01:57:33.714 line:82%
What's goin' on?

1685
01:57:37.301 --> 01:57:41.388 line:82%
The roads are asleep
Where are we off to?

1686
01:57:41.472 --> 01:57:44.975 line:82%
What's goin' on?

1687
01:57:46.602 --> 01:57:48.729 line:82%
Why, who asked you out?

1688
01:57:48.812 --> 01:57:51.996 line:82%
Why are you wagging behind me?

1689
01:57:55.569 --> 01:57:58.739 line:82%
What's your bother?
I'll do what I want

1690
01:57:58.824 --> 01:58:01.200 line:82%
Who are you to preach?

1691
01:58:01.283 --> 01:58:06.538 line:82%
I'm on my way, why do you follow?
What's goin' on?

1692
01:58:09.041 --> 01:58:13.462 line:82%
Quarter to midnight
Two souls on a roll

1693
01:58:13.754 --> 01:58:15.672 line:82%
What's goin' on?

1694
01:58:37.945 --> 01:58:42.079 line:82%
Stop acting high and mighty

1695
01:58:42.366 --> 01:58:46.620 line:82%
It's a big, bad world out there

1696
01:58:46.703 --> 01:58:51.124 line:82%
Where'd you learn to talk big?

1697
01:58:51.208 --> 01:58:55.587 line:82%
Don't try to save me from the world

1698
01:58:55.671 --> 01:58:58.966 line:82%
Why girl, you'll regret being gone

1699
01:59:00.133 --> 01:59:03.887 line:82%
You run now, but you'll return

1700
01:59:04.638 --> 01:59:09.560 line:82%
What I know is, once you're gone
You never return

1701
01:59:09.810 --> 01:59:14.898 line:82%
I'm on my way, why do you follow?
What's goin' on?

1702
01:59:18.151 --> 01:59:22.197 line:82%
Quarter to midnight
Two souls on a roll

1703
01:59:22.406 --> 01:59:24.408 line:82%
What's goin' on?

1704
02:00:06.909 --> 02:00:10.454 line:82%
Come on
Tell me this

1705
02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:15.292 line:82%
Why do you care?

1706
02:00:16.168 --> 02:00:20.255 line:82%
Who cares, go, get lost

1707
02:00:20.464 --> 02:00:23.842 line:82%
Live like a loner, if you want

1708
02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:28.972 line:82%
I'll live like a loner
If I got to go it alone

1709
02:00:29.264 --> 02:00:32.809 line:82%
I'll take my losses
And I'll get along

1710
02:00:34.186 --> 02:00:35.861 line:82%
Then get going

1711
02:00:36.058 --> 02:00:38.899 line:82%
Getting along, alone
Let me know how it goes

1712
02:00:39.232 --> 02:00:43.445 line:82%
I'm on my way, why do you follow?
What's goin' on?

1713
02:00:47.199 --> 02:00:51.119 line:82%
Why, who asked you out?

1714
02:00:51.203 --> 02:00:54.081 line:82%
Why are you wagging behind me?

1715
02:00:56.708 --> 02:01:00.379 line:82%
What's your bother?
I'll do what I want

1716
02:01:00.462 --> 02:01:01.713 line:82%
Who are you to preach?

1717
02:01:01.797 --> 02:01:06.301 line:82%
I'm on my way, why do you follow?
What's goin' on?

1718
02:01:10.055 --> 02:01:14.643 line:82%
Quarter to midnight
Two souls on a roll

1719
02:01:14.726 --> 02:01:17.729 line:82%
What's goin' on?

1720
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:23.568 line:82%
The roads are asleep
Where are we off to?

1721
02:01:23.654 --> 02:01:25.028 line:82%
What's goin' on?

1722
02:01:28.407 --> 02:01:32.661 line:82%
Quarter to midnight
Two souls on a roll

1723
02:01:32.953 --> 02:01:36.248 line:82%
What's goin' on?

1724
02:01:49.052 --> 02:01:53.056 line:82%
You ever have that dream about going
to work wearing no clothes?

1725
02:01:54.266 --> 02:01:59.271 line:82%
No? I dream it often.
And I feel exactly like that right now.

1726
02:02:01.231 --> 02:02:06.109 line:82%
Two Ben & Jerry's Belgian
Dark Chocolate ice creams, please.

1727
02:02:06.194 --> 02:02:09.239 line:82%
- Anything else, sir?
- No, just lots of it.

1728
02:02:16.246 --> 02:02:17.539 line:82%
Thank you.

1729
02:02:36.516 --> 02:02:39.686 line:82%
Stop it, people will think
I'm doing something to you.

1730
02:02:42.022 --> 02:02:43.190 line:82%
You know what?

1731
02:02:44.357 --> 02:02:46.151 line:82%
I completely understand.

1732
02:02:51.031 --> 02:02:52.074 line:82%
Thanks.

1733
02:03:04.002 --> 02:03:06.630 line:82%
You're not eating. Isn't it good?

1734
02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:13.136 line:82%
It's perfect.

1735
02:04:16.912 --> 02:04:18.535 line:82%
There's a cooking show on TV.

1736
02:04:18.618 --> 02:04:21.621 line:82%
I'd really like to watch it.
Can I have the cable please?

1737
02:04:22.164 --> 02:04:23.748 line:82%
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1738
02:04:25.167 --> 02:04:26.626 line:82%
Thank you.

1739
02:04:29.004 --> 02:04:31.298 line:82%
I'll keep the volume down. I promise.

1740
02:04:31.798 --> 02:04:32.799 line:82%
Thanks.

1741
02:04:48.523 --> 02:04:50.108 line:82%
Do you want to watch something?

1742
02:04:51.193 --> 02:04:52.402 line:82%
No, thanks.

1743
02:04:55.071 --> 02:04:58.783 line:82%
Nick, I need to talk to you.

1744
02:05:06.041 --> 02:05:07.250 line:82%
Tell me.

1745
02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.461 line:82%
Nick, you're not doing anything wrong.

1746
02:05:10.295 --> 02:05:14.299 line:82%
You're not ready for a marriage and kids,
and you're being completely honest.

1747
02:05:15.926 --> 02:05:20.388 line:82%
You're just doing what's right for you,
and what you want for yourself.

1748
02:05:22.724 --> 02:05:24.768 line:82%
Who can understand this better than me?

1749
02:05:26.686 --> 02:05:29.481 line:82%
I've always lived my life for myself.

1750
02:05:30.232 --> 02:05:34.736 line:82%
I never thought about
how it might affect my mom and dad.

1751
02:05:36.196 --> 02:05:39.699 line:82%
Who knows? Maybe this is retribution.

1752
02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:42.869 line:82%
Maybe it's all karma.

1753
02:05:44.246 --> 02:05:46.831 line:82%
And only you could give me this lesson.

1754
02:05:48.333 --> 02:05:50.627 line:82%
Because I've never loved anybody so much.

1755
02:05:53.255 --> 02:05:54.673 line:82%
Look, Amby, I...

1756
02:05:55.715 --> 02:06:01.680 line:82%
Until now, it was all about me,
my happiness, my pain, my life.

1757
02:06:03.056 --> 02:06:06.518 line:82%
Not anymore. Now everything has changed.

1758
02:06:08.645 --> 02:06:09.989 line:82%
Now it's all about my baby.

1759
02:06:11.690 --> 02:06:17.362 line:82%
This life that's growing inside me.
I can do anything for this baby, Nick.

1760
02:06:17.862 --> 02:06:19.197 line:82%
I can endure anything.

1761
02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:22.284 line:82%
But I can't imagine my baby being hurt.

1762
02:06:24.286 --> 02:06:29.040 line:82%
I'd decided never to ask you anything
for either me or my baby.

1763
02:06:31.563 --> 02:06:33.966 line:82%
But I've gathered the courage
to ask you for something.

1764
02:06:34.713 --> 02:06:35.797 line:82%
What?

1765
02:06:35.884 --> 02:06:37.590 line:82%
I have a disorder in my blood.

1766
02:06:38.717 --> 02:06:40.051 line:82%
Anything serious?

1767
02:06:40.635 --> 02:06:43.596 line:82%
No. I have thalassemia minor.

1768
02:06:44.639 --> 02:06:46.516 line:82%
This doesn't affect me in any way.

1769
02:06:47.726 --> 02:06:53.064 line:82%
But if you...
if you have this disorder too,

1770
02:06:53.315 --> 02:06:55.650 line:82%
then there could be
complications for the baby.

1771
02:06:56.276 --> 02:06:58.445 line:82%
The child could have thalassemia major.

1772
02:06:58.528 --> 02:07:00.530 line:82%
I don't have any complications.

1773
02:07:00.947 --> 02:07:02.615 line:82%
Trust me. I am fine.

1774
02:07:02.866 --> 02:07:05.327 line:82%
Nick, get a blood test, please.

1775
02:07:05.577 --> 02:07:07.912 line:82%
What? No way.

1776
02:07:08.121 --> 02:07:09.748 line:82%
There's nothing wrong with me.

1777
02:07:09.831 --> 02:07:11.666 line:82%
I've never had a problem in my life.
I'm fine.

1778
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:14.294 line:82%
Nick, you can't be sure
unless you have the test.

1779
02:07:14.377 --> 02:07:18.340 line:82%
Please, for me, for my baby,
Nick. It's a small blood test.

1780
02:07:18.423 --> 02:07:20.091 line:82%
Please, I beg of you.

1781
02:07:20.425 --> 02:07:24.387 line:82%
Look, Amby, try and understand,

1782
02:07:24.929 --> 02:07:28.099 line:82%
I've never taken a blood test in my life.

1783
02:07:28.641 --> 02:07:30.185 line:82%
I won't be able to do it.

1784
02:07:31.019 --> 02:07:32.312 line:82%
I'm sorry.

1785
02:07:33.063 --> 02:07:35.065 line:82%
I asked you for such a little thing.

1786
02:07:35.482 --> 02:07:38.360 line:82%
I'm sorry, Amby. I just can't do it.

1787
02:07:39.986 --> 02:07:41.196 line:82%
Go away, Nick.

1788
02:07:52.749 --> 02:07:54.167 line:82%
Nikhil Arora.

1789
02:07:54.918 --> 02:07:56.002 line:82%
How can I help you?

1790
02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:58.380 line:82%
It's about the pregnancy.

1791
02:07:58.463 --> 02:07:59.547 line:82%
You're pregnant?

1792
02:08:00.298 --> 02:08:03.551 line:82%
No, I'm... I'm Ambar's boyfriend.

1793
02:08:05.303 --> 02:08:07.889 line:82%
So, you're the one who's scared of blood.

1794
02:08:08.723 --> 02:08:12.207 line:82%
- You're really scared, aren't you?
- Yes. Can we do this quickly?

1795
02:08:12.570 --> 02:08:13.662 line:82%
You don't worry at all.

1796
02:08:13.755 --> 02:08:15.313 line:82%
It won't even take a minute.

1797
02:08:15.688 --> 02:08:19.484 line:82%
We just need to put a syringe
in your vein and extract ten cc of blood.

1798
02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:24.114 line:82%
Nick, are you okay?

1799
02:08:24.572 --> 02:08:28.701 line:82%
No. So, please hurry up
and do what you have to do.

1800
02:08:34.249 --> 02:08:35.291 line:82%
It's over.

1801
02:08:35.375 --> 02:08:36.584 line:82%
Did it hurt?

1802
02:08:36.876 --> 02:08:41.214 line:82%
What? It's over? Are we done?

1803
02:08:41.756 --> 02:08:44.843 line:82%
- Can I go?
- Sure. You'll get the report tomorrow.

1804
02:08:47.303 --> 02:08:50.765 line:82%
You can take this copy
of the sonography with you if you like.

1805
02:08:54.311 --> 02:08:55.311 line:82%
Give it to Ambar.

1806
02:08:55.395 --> 02:08:56.479 line:82%
Thank you.

1807
02:08:57.105 --> 02:08:58.481 line:82%
And congratulations.

1808
02:09:01.443 --> 02:09:02.484 line:82%
For the blood test?

1809
02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:05.029 line:82%
No, for the twins.

1810
02:09:10.995 --> 02:09:11.995 line:82%
Twins?

1811
02:09:12.078 --> 02:09:15.627 line:82%
Yes. Didn't Ambar tell you?
You're going to have twins.

1812
02:09:18.243 --> 02:09:21.254 line:82%
I'm meeting you for the first time
eight months into her pregnancy.

1813
02:09:21.337 --> 02:09:22.422 line:82%
You're the father.

1814
02:09:22.505 --> 02:09:25.967 line:82%
Don't you have any responsibility?
She's doing everything alone.

1815
02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:30.138 line:82%
There's nobody to help her,
neither her family, nor yours.

1816
02:09:30.555 --> 02:09:33.892 line:82%
I've told her to rest,
but I don't think she's listening.

1817
02:09:34.142 --> 02:09:37.395 line:82%
Nick, you need to support her,
help her.

1818
02:09:37.979 --> 02:09:41.733 line:82%
For God's sake, she's gone through this
all alone, and that's not fair.

1819
02:09:42.525 --> 02:09:48.490 line:82%
She needs love, she needs to be
cared for and only you can do this.

1820
02:09:48.698 --> 02:09:52.035 line:82%
So, please. Please be there
for her now, Nick.

1821
02:10:05.548 --> 02:10:07.343 line:82%
Because I love you, Nick.

1822
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:10.453 line:82%
And maybe I want the right
to have a say in your life,

1823
02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:13.473 line:82%
and I want to give you that right too.

1824
02:10:13.681 --> 02:10:16.643 line:82%
Why are we afraid of giving
this relationship a name, Nick?

1825
02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:18.937 line:82%
I'm not afraid, Amby.

1826
02:10:20.063 --> 02:10:22.732 line:82%
I'm not afraid of giving
this relationship a name now.

1827
02:10:43.318 --> 02:10:44.469 line:82%
I'll take this one.

1828
02:11:00.144 --> 02:11:01.437 line:82%
Nick, you're not being fair.

1829
02:11:01.521 --> 02:11:05.483 line:82%
The decision to separate was yours.
You weren't ready for commitment.

1830
02:11:05.858 --> 02:11:07.485 line:82%
So what was she supposed to do?

1831
02:11:08.111 --> 02:11:12.448 line:82%
Wait for you all her life?
Or wallow in sorrow?

1832
02:11:13.575 --> 02:11:16.578 line:82%
Get real Nick, it's 2005.
Everyone has a life.

1833
02:11:17.745 --> 02:11:19.038 line:82%
Was it so easy for her?

1834
02:11:19.122 --> 02:11:21.291 line:82%
You'd like it if it was difficult, right?

1835
02:11:22.667 --> 02:11:24.335 line:82%
- I still love her.
- No, you don't.

1836
02:11:24.419 --> 02:11:28.006 line:82%
If you did love her, you wouldn't have
left her in this condition.

1837
02:11:28.089 --> 02:11:30.091 line:82%
Couldn't she have waited a little while?

1838
02:11:31.050 --> 02:11:32.677 line:82%
Did you tell her to wait?

1839
02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:35.680 line:82%
Now you'll just have to live with that.

1840
02:11:36.848 --> 02:11:41.644 line:82%
Hi, baby. Oh, God. I'm so sorry!
Of course, I remember.

1841
02:11:41.730 --> 02:11:44.480 line:82%
No, Nick had a small problem.

1842
02:11:45.481 --> 02:11:47.859 line:82%
No, I'm not drinking with him! Really!

1843
02:11:47.942 --> 02:11:49.277 line:82%
I'll be right over, baby.

1844
02:11:49.777 --> 02:11:53.114 line:82%
Shit, man. Cathy wanted to eat
swiss rolls and I completely forgot.

1845
02:11:53.573 --> 02:11:56.409 line:82%
I'll see you, man, take care.
Don't drink too much, okay?

1846
02:11:59.292 --> 02:12:02.206 line:82%
Hello? Hello?

1847
02:12:08.087 --> 02:12:09.297 line:82%
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

1848
02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:11.366 line:82%
No, no. Is everything all right?

1849
02:12:11.633 --> 02:12:13.384 line:82%
Somebody wanted to meet you.

1850
02:12:14.218 --> 02:12:17.180 line:82%
Tina, meet Ambar. Ambar, Tina.

1851
02:12:17.847 --> 02:12:21.680 line:82%
I've heard so much about you,
I just had to meet you.

1852
02:12:21.768 --> 02:12:22.810 line:82%
I'll get it.

1853
02:12:24.729 --> 02:12:26.773 line:82%
Hello? Hello?

1854
02:12:28.232 --> 02:12:29.776 line:82%
It's a blank call, forget it.

1855
02:12:29.859 --> 02:12:31.611 line:82%
So what's the date for the wedding?

1856
02:12:42.205 --> 02:12:46.834 line:82%
Okay, Ambar.
When did I tell you to wait for me?

1857
02:12:49.045 --> 02:12:51.422 line:82%
When did I say I was going to come back?

1858
02:12:54.133 --> 02:12:55.218 line:82%
You be happy.

1859
02:12:57.261 --> 02:13:00.306 line:82%
Be happy with that... idiot.

1860
02:13:02.141 --> 02:13:05.144 line:82%
Good luck. I love you.

1861
02:13:09.023 --> 02:13:10.817 line:82%
You're talking to yourself.

1862
02:13:12.026 --> 02:13:13.569 line:82%
Got no one else to talk to.

1863
02:13:14.570 --> 02:13:15.947 line:82%
Buy me a drink?

1864
02:13:16.948 --> 02:13:19.367 line:82%
Hi, I'm Nick and I'm very drunk.

1865
02:13:19.575 --> 02:13:23.996 line:82%
I'm Stella, and I'm quite drunk myself.
What fun!

1866
02:13:38.223 --> 02:13:41.514 line:82%
Andy, once you're done, I'd like you
to load the couch into the truck, please.

1867
02:13:41.597 --> 02:13:43.224 line:82%
- No worries.
- Thank you.

1868
02:13:43.975 --> 02:13:45.059 line:82%
What's happening?

1869
02:13:45.768 --> 02:13:49.105 line:82%
I don't want to wait until the end
of the month. I'm moving out today.

1870
02:13:54.861 --> 02:13:57.572 line:82%
Hey, Ambar. Where are you?
Pick up the phone.

1871
02:13:57.655 --> 02:14:00.450 line:82%
I'm so happy. The wedding date
has finally been set.

1872
02:14:00.533 --> 02:14:04.996 line:82%
Tina says meeting you yesterday
was like finding an old friend.

1873
02:14:05.079 --> 02:14:07.039 line:82%
I want to hear what you thought of Tina.

1874
02:14:07.123 --> 02:14:10.418 line:82%
If you don't like her, then tell me now.
Our wedding's in a week.

1875
02:14:10.501 --> 02:14:12.170 line:82%
Call me back. Bye.

1876
02:14:14.589 --> 02:14:18.134 line:82%
Jignesh and Tina.

1877
02:14:23.848 --> 02:14:27.727 line:82%
Who... what... who... what?

1878
02:14:27.810 --> 02:14:29.020 line:82%
Who what?

1879
02:14:29.105 --> 02:14:31.189 line:82%
Who are you and what are you doing here?

1880
02:14:31.272 --> 02:14:34.734 line:82%
That's really nice. I'm Stella.
We met at the bar last night.

1881
02:14:38.654 --> 02:14:43.701 line:82%
- Okay, you have to leave, now.
- What? Get me some coffee first!

1882
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:47.121 line:82%
Your bloody coffee can...
You have to leave now.

1883
02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:52.125 line:82%
- Why?
- Because my mom will kill me. And you.

1884
02:14:52.210 --> 02:14:56.839 line:82%
My mom will kill us both! She's crazy!
Put your clothes on quick and hurry.

1885
02:15:01.063 --> 02:15:02.199 line:82%
- Hello?
- Hi, Ambar.

1886
02:15:02.445 --> 02:15:06.432 line:82%
- Hi Doctor. Is something wrong?
- Not at all.

1887
02:15:06.641 --> 02:15:09.310 line:82%
I called to tell you that
Nick's reports have come in.

1888
02:15:09.519 --> 02:15:11.562 line:82%
- Reports?
- Of his blood test.

1889
02:15:13.147 --> 02:15:18.694 line:82%
- Nick went for a blood test?
- Yesterday. And honestly, he was scared.

1890
02:15:20.571 --> 02:15:23.070 line:82%
Doctor, is everything all right?

1891
02:15:23.157 --> 02:15:26.160 line:82%
Absolutely fine. No signs of thalassemia.

1892
02:15:26.244 --> 02:15:29.247 line:82%
I knew you'd be nervous.
So, I called you personally.

1893
02:15:29.330 --> 02:15:31.872 line:82%
Thank you, Doctor, thank you so much.

1894
02:15:31.958 --> 02:15:34.252 line:82%
You're welcome, honey. See you next week.

1895
02:15:45.763 --> 02:15:48.224 line:82%
- What happened?
- Nothing. Hi.

1896
02:15:48.432 --> 02:15:52.061 line:82%
- Can I come in?
- No, no! This is my room.

1897
02:15:52.144 --> 02:15:54.522 line:82%
- You go to your room.
- What?

1898
02:15:54.814 --> 02:15:58.693 line:82%
Yes. My room is very dirty.
You want to talk, let's talk in your room.

1899
02:15:59.652 --> 02:16:00.903 line:82%
Nick, is that your mom?

1900
02:16:06.701 --> 02:16:10.246 line:82%
Hi Mom. Sorry, I was just leaving.

1901
02:16:12.206 --> 02:16:15.084 line:82%
I never thought I'd ever say this to you.

1902
02:16:16.502 --> 02:16:18.212 line:82%
Thank you for not loving me.

1903
02:16:19.714 --> 02:16:21.674 line:82%
Thank you for not marrying me.

1904
02:16:23.301 --> 02:16:24.886 line:82%
Thank you for everything.

1905
02:16:32.352 --> 02:16:33.352 line:82%
What have I done?

1906
02:16:33.436 --> 02:16:36.022 line:82%
I'll tell you what you've done.
You've done nothing.

1907
02:16:36.772 --> 02:16:39.734 line:82%
- What?
- Is this any way to treat a girl?

1908
02:16:39.817 --> 02:16:43.779 line:82%
You buy me drinks, get me drunk, we come
back to your place and what do you do?

1909
02:16:44.572 --> 02:16:47.031 line:82%
- What did I do?
- Nothing, that's just it. Nothing.

1910
02:16:47.116 --> 02:16:51.370 line:82%
You didn't kiss me, you didn't touch me.
Think I came here to hear your stories?

1911
02:16:52.288 --> 02:16:54.999 line:82%
- What stories?
- Who's this Ambar chick?

1912
02:16:55.082 --> 02:16:57.960 line:82%
All night you kept crying,
and telling me how much you love Ambar.

1913
02:16:58.044 --> 02:17:00.963 line:82%
Well, if you love Ambar so much,
why did you waste my time?

1914
02:17:01.756 --> 02:17:04.300 line:82%
- I didn't do anything?
- Not to me you didn't.

1915
02:17:05.301 --> 02:17:06.800 line:82%
I didn't do anything!

1916
02:17:06.886 --> 02:17:09.347 line:82%
Yes, I knew it. I didn't do anything!

1917
02:17:10.014 --> 02:17:11.098 line:82%
I didn't do anything!

1918
02:17:11.182 --> 02:17:12.767 line:82%
I didn't do anything!

1919
02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:15.853 line:82%
Yes, I knew it. I didn't do anything!

1920
02:17:15.937 --> 02:17:20.232 line:82%
Ambar, I didn't do anything.

1921
02:17:39.293 --> 02:17:41.128 line:82%
- Is her stuff coming to your place?
- Yes.

1922
02:17:41.212 --> 02:17:43.673 line:82%
- So where is Ambar?
- I don't know.

1923
02:17:44.382 --> 02:17:45.424 line:82%
Okay.

1924
02:17:45.508 --> 02:17:52.054 line:82%
Whenever she calls, just tell her that...
Nick didn't do anything. Okay?

1925
02:17:52.139 --> 02:17:54.683 line:82%
Just tell her that. She'll understand.

1926
02:17:54.892 --> 02:17:56.185 line:82%
And tell Cathy as well.

1927
02:17:57.061 --> 02:17:58.062 line:82%
Thanks.

1928
02:17:59.313 --> 02:18:00.940 line:82%
Where are you Ambar?

1929
02:18:03.651 --> 02:18:08.072 line:82%
- Jignesh? Nick here. Where's Ambar?
- Why should I tell you?

1930
02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:09.506 line:82%
Just tell me where she is.

1931
02:18:09.597 --> 02:18:10.675 line:82%
You hurt her, you know.

1932
02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.118 line:82%
I know, I know.

1933
02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:16.288 line:82%
She loves you, and all you did
was make her cry, hurt her.

1934
02:18:16.539 --> 02:18:18.163 line:82%
Okay, Jignesh, listen to me.

1935
02:18:18.249 --> 02:18:22.420 line:82%
The next time I see you, just slap me.
Twice. I won't say anything, I swear.

1936
02:18:22.653 --> 02:18:24.356 line:82%
But just tell me where Ambar is right now.

1937
02:18:24.439 --> 02:18:25.523 line:82%
I don't know.

1938
02:18:26.048 --> 02:18:27.550 line:82%
- You don't know?
- No idea.

1939
02:18:27.633 --> 02:18:30.218 line:82%
Then why the hell were
you lecturing me for so long?

1940
02:18:30.302 --> 02:18:32.638 line:82%
Okay, look. I'm sorry.

1941
02:18:32.724 --> 02:18:35.850 line:82%
I misjudged you as well.
I'm... I'm screwed up, man.

1942
02:18:35.933 --> 02:18:39.562 line:82%
- Sometimes I get so stupid.
- No problem.

1943
02:18:39.645 --> 02:18:43.105 line:82%
- Just don't hurt her anymore.
- I won't. I swear.

1944
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:46.410 line:82%
- Please call me if you hear anything.
- You got it.

1945
02:18:46.495 --> 02:18:51.490 line:82%
Thanks. And hey, congratulations.
For you and Tina.

1946
02:18:52.033 --> 02:18:53.284 line:82%
Thanks.

1947
02:18:53.576 --> 02:18:55.870 line:82%
See, Ambar, I can be a nice man.

1948
02:18:57.872 --> 02:18:59.331 line:82%
Where are you?

1949
02:19:02.501 --> 02:19:05.754 line:82%
Salaam Namaste, ladies and gentlemen.

1950
02:19:05.838 --> 02:19:11.343 line:82%
I'm sure you still remember
our Big Fight show, Hambar versus Nick.

1951
02:19:11.427 --> 02:19:15.848 line:82%
On this very show,
Nick fell in love with Hambar.

1952
02:19:15.931 --> 02:19:19.143 line:82%
But the story is not over.

1953
02:19:19.226 --> 02:19:23.439 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen,
Salaam Namaste proudly presents,

1954
02:19:23.522 --> 02:19:27.985 line:82%
Hambar versus Nick, part two.

1955
02:19:33.783 --> 02:19:36.702 line:82%
My name is Nikhil Arora.

1956
02:19:38.162 --> 02:19:39.830 line:82%
And I have lost something.

1957
02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:45.753 line:82%
In fact, I have lost the most
beautiful thing in the world.

1958
02:19:46.879 --> 02:19:49.006 line:82%
And I need your help to find it again.

1959
02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:52.426 line:82%
Her name is Ambar.

1960
02:19:53.427 --> 02:19:56.013 line:82%
She is the most beautiful girl
in the world.

1961
02:19:58.015 --> 02:20:00.184 line:82%
She's wearing a black-and-white dress,

1962
02:20:01.477 --> 02:20:03.187 line:82%
she's eight months pregnant,

1963
02:20:03.771 --> 02:20:06.273 line:82%
and her eyes are red from crying.

1964
02:20:07.108 --> 02:20:08.692 line:82%
If anyone sees her,

1965
02:20:09.295 --> 02:20:15.116 line:82%
please call me on 040-956-3700.

1966
02:20:15.699 --> 02:20:18.202 line:82%
Don't worry, Nick,
I'm going to find Ambar for you.

1967
02:20:19.161 --> 02:20:20.537 line:82%
Ambar! I'm coming.

1968
02:20:20.621 --> 02:20:22.123 line:82%
Nick, I'll find Ambar for you.

1969
02:20:22.206 --> 02:20:24.143 line:82%
After promising happiness,
I caused sorrow.

1970
02:20:24.226 --> 02:20:25.751 line:82%
Is he talking about you?

1971
02:20:25.835 --> 02:20:29.338 line:82%
I'm sorry. Ambar, come back. Please.

1972
02:20:29.547 --> 02:20:32.883 line:82%
Not because you need me.
I know that you don't.

1973
02:20:33.592 --> 02:20:37.763 line:82%
But I need you. I'm all alone
without you, I'm incomplete.

1974
02:20:38.097 --> 02:20:41.015 line:82%
I'll be your best friend, Ambar.
I'll be the best husband.

1975
02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:43.227 line:82%
And I'll be the best father to our babies.

1976
02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:46.619 line:82%
One more thing, about
what you saw this morning,

1977
02:20:46.856 --> 02:20:50.651 line:82%
I swear to you, nothing happened.
I didn't do anything.

1978
02:20:51.193 --> 02:20:54.280 line:82%
I just kept calling out your name
and crying the whole night.

1979
02:20:54.655 --> 02:20:55.990 line:82%
Please, believe me Ambar.

1980
02:20:56.217 --> 02:20:59.994 line:82%
If anybody sees her,
please call Nikhil Arora.

1981
02:21:04.999 --> 02:21:06.750 line:82%
Please, stop the taxi.

1982
02:21:06.834 --> 02:21:08.626 line:82%
Just a minute.
I need to make a quick call.

1983
02:21:08.711 --> 02:21:11.046 line:82%
Stop the cab. Take this. Just stop.

1984
02:21:16.343 --> 02:21:17.636 line:82%
Where? Williamstown?

1985
02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:20.472 line:82%
Best of luck, buddy!
Your speech got me so emotional!

1986
02:21:20.558 --> 02:21:24.518 line:82%
Buddy! I pray that
your cab never runs out of fuel!

1987
02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:27.184 line:82%
Got it!

1988
02:21:27.271 --> 02:21:30.691 line:82%
Hambar versus Nick! How beautiful!

1989
02:21:42.369 --> 02:21:43.662 line:82%
Excuse me.

1990
02:21:47.541 --> 02:21:50.377 line:82%
Route 72, going south?
Thank you very much.

1991
02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:51.879 line:82%
All the best, mate.

1992
02:22:05.476 --> 02:22:07.436 line:82%
Excuse me, can you please stop the bus?

1993
02:22:07.519 --> 02:22:11.482 line:82%
Nikhil Arora? Your lady love just
stepped off the bus at fisherman's wharf.

1994
02:22:29.041 --> 02:22:32.962 line:82%
I'm sorry, Amby.

1995
02:22:33.045 --> 02:22:35.881 line:82%
Why are you doing this, Nick?

1996
02:22:35.965 --> 02:22:38.657 line:82%
Because ten years from now,

1997
02:22:38.884 --> 02:22:42.972 line:82%
when I wake up all alone and ask myself

1998
02:22:43.847 --> 02:22:48.894 line:82%
why I didn't give Nick and Ambar a chance,
I'll have only one answer.

1999
02:22:49.478 --> 02:22:51.981 line:82%
That I'm the biggest idiot in the world.

2000
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:56.914 line:82%
And I don't want to be with
the biggest idiot in the world.

2001
02:22:57.111 --> 02:22:59.530 line:82%
People can change, right?

2002
02:22:59.613 --> 02:23:03.492 line:82%
You didn't want to get married,
now you do.

2003
02:23:04.201 --> 02:23:08.872 line:82%
I didn't want to get married. And now...

2004
02:23:15.212 --> 02:23:19.133 line:82%
Amby, will you...

2005
02:23:19.758 --> 02:23:21.176 line:82%
Now what?

2006
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:23.095 line:82%
I think my water just broke.

2007
02:23:23.394 --> 02:23:26.688 line:82%
What? But there's still a month
to go. How can that be?

2008
02:23:33.522 --> 02:23:37.693 line:82%
Ambar, you didn't answer me!
Will you forgive me? Please!

2009
02:23:37.776 --> 02:23:40.029 line:82%
I'm very sorry for all the pain
I've caused you.

2010
02:23:40.112 --> 02:23:42.990 line:82%
Can you forget all that
and give me one more chance?

2011
02:23:44.033 --> 02:23:45.659 line:82%
Okay, no problem.

2012
02:23:45.743 --> 02:23:47.661 line:82%
You can think about it and tell me later.

2013
02:23:47.745 --> 02:23:49.330 line:82%
Just shut up. Just shut up.

2014
02:23:49.536 --> 02:23:53.292 line:82%
I'll be right back. Stay right here.

2015
02:23:53.375 --> 02:23:55.627 line:82%
Where would I go you idiot? Just go!

2016
02:23:55.711 --> 02:23:57.129 line:82%
Crap! You're right.

2017
02:24:01.592 --> 02:24:04.000 line:82%
Too many emergency pregnancies...

2018
02:24:04.083 --> 02:24:07.139 line:82%
something about the Moon's position,
a partial eclipse or some rubbish.

2019
02:24:07.222 --> 02:24:10.476 line:82%
Anyway, your doctor's not free and no
private room is available. What do we do?

2020
02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:12.102 line:82%
What do we do? What do we do?

2021
02:24:12.686 --> 02:24:15.522 line:82%
Take a semi-private room here
or go to another hospital?

2022
02:24:15.606 --> 02:24:18.107 line:82%
Another?
Nick, what the hell is wrong with you?

2023
02:24:18.192 --> 02:24:20.194 line:82%
This isn't a restaurant
that we can find another.

2024
02:24:20.278 --> 02:24:22.780 line:82%
Take what we're getting or
I'll have the babies right here!

2025
02:24:22.863 --> 02:24:25.532 line:82%
Okay, a semi-private room, then.

2026
02:24:26.241 --> 02:24:28.327 line:82%
Listen, I'm really sorry about everything.

2027
02:24:28.410 --> 02:24:30.329 line:82%
If you give me one more chance...

2028
02:24:30.996 --> 02:24:32.498 line:82%
Okay, we'll talk later.

2029
02:24:35.224 --> 02:24:37.211 line:82%
Okay lady, we're going to put you
on the bed now.

2030
02:24:37.294 --> 02:24:38.670 line:82%
One minute. Listen.

2031
02:24:38.754 --> 02:24:41.006 line:82%
You'll have to prop up
your feet like this.

2032
02:24:41.090 --> 02:24:44.676 line:82%
And then you'll have to breathe
deeply, like this.

2033
02:24:45.052 --> 02:24:48.555 line:82%
And then, when the time comes,
you have to push, like this.

2034
02:24:51.392 --> 02:24:53.477 line:82%
Sorry, I saw it on TV.

2035
02:24:53.769 --> 02:24:55.145 line:82%
You probably know.

2036
02:24:56.105 --> 02:24:57.898 line:82%
We'll help you on the bed now.

2037
02:25:03.487 --> 02:25:05.572 line:82%
Hey sexy. It's you again.

2038
02:25:05.656 --> 02:25:07.408 line:82%
Nick, do you know her?

2039
02:25:07.699 --> 02:25:09.576 line:82%
Hi Mom, you're having another baby!

2040
02:25:09.660 --> 02:25:11.412 line:82%
Okay, is there any other nurse?

2041
02:25:11.787 --> 02:25:14.080 line:82%
No lover, everyone's busy.

2042
02:25:14.164 --> 02:25:15.582 line:82%
Nick, who is she?

2043
02:25:15.666 --> 02:25:16.875 line:82%
I don't know, who are you?

2044
02:25:16.959 --> 02:25:20.504 line:82%
Don't you remember, Mom?
I was in the room this morning.

2045
02:25:23.006 --> 02:25:25.467 line:82%
Amby. Amby, please listen to me.

2046
02:25:25.676 --> 02:25:28.595 line:82%
I swear nothing happened between us,
ask her if you like.

2047
02:25:28.679 --> 02:25:33.600 line:82%
You're Ambar! This guy really loves you.
All night he was crying saying,

2048
02:25:33.684 --> 02:25:37.646 line:82%
"I love my Ambar, I miss my Ambar."
He wouldn't even let me kiss him.

2049
02:25:37.729 --> 02:25:39.148 line:82%
He said, "You're not Ambar."

2050
02:25:39.233 --> 02:25:40.770 line:82%
See! See?

2051
02:25:40.858 --> 02:25:42.609 line:82%
Nothing happened, Ambar, nothing.

2052
02:25:42.693 --> 02:25:43.777 line:82%
Please believe me.

2053
02:25:43.861 --> 02:25:45.070 line:82%
Now will you forgive me?

2054
02:25:45.154 --> 02:25:46.947 line:82%
Ambar, I have to tell you...

2055
02:25:48.282 --> 02:25:50.534 line:82%
Okay crap, where's the doctor?

2056
02:25:51.076 --> 02:25:52.950 line:82%
You're looking lovely!

2057
02:25:53.423 --> 02:25:57.207 line:82%
Nick! Isn't it amazing?
We're becoming daddies together!

2058
02:25:57.291 --> 02:25:59.543 line:82%
I know. Isn't it cool?

2059
02:25:59.626 --> 02:26:00.627 line:82%
Ron!

2060
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:02.129 line:82%
Shut up. I'm talking to him.

2061
02:26:02.212 --> 02:26:03.797 line:82%
I'm having your baby.

2062
02:26:03.881 --> 02:26:04.965 line:82%
I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry.

2063
02:26:05.048 --> 02:26:06.842 line:82%
Where the hell is the doctor?

2064
02:26:06.925 --> 02:26:08.260 line:82%
Here I am!

2065
02:26:08.343 --> 02:26:12.980 line:82%
Allow me to introduce myself...
a little later.

2066
02:26:26.278 --> 02:26:28.906 line:82%
Who am I... where am I?

2067
02:26:28.989 --> 02:26:30.449 line:82%
Are you the doctor?

2068
02:26:33.202 --> 02:26:35.162 line:82%
- Doc, I need your introduction.
- Of course!

2069
02:26:35.245 --> 02:26:37.706 line:82%
- I am Doctor Vijay Kumar, M.D.D.G.O.
- What are you doing?

2070
02:26:37.789 --> 02:26:39.082 line:82%
Fantastic! From where?

2071
02:26:39.166 --> 02:26:40.584 line:82%
- Surat.
- Surat. I like Surat.

2072
02:26:40.667 --> 02:26:41.752 line:82%
Shut up, Ron.

2073
02:26:41.835 --> 02:26:44.171 line:82%
- Where the hell have you been?
- I... that, that...

2074
02:26:44.254 --> 02:26:46.924 line:82%
- What's that?
- Where babies are born.

2075
02:26:47.007 --> 02:26:49.176 line:82%
- Delivery?
- Delivery! I was in delivery.

2076
02:26:49.259 --> 02:26:50.969 line:82%
- Now where is she?
- Who?

2077
02:26:51.053 --> 02:26:54.181 line:82%
- That, that...
- What's that?

2078
02:26:54.264 --> 02:26:56.016 line:82%
- The one who's delivering.
- Patient?

2079
02:26:56.099 --> 02:26:57.434 line:82%
Patient! Where's the patient?

2080
02:26:57.518 --> 02:26:59.100 line:82%
- Here.
- There.

2081
02:26:59.183 --> 02:27:01.125 line:82%
- Where's the other doctor?
- What other doctor?

2082
02:27:01.208 --> 02:27:03.190 line:82%
- How should I know?
- Then how would I know?

2083
02:27:03.275 --> 02:27:05.817 line:82%
Look, there are two patients here.
Can you handle both?

2084
02:27:05.901 --> 02:27:06.902 line:82%
I hope so.

2085
02:27:06.985 --> 02:27:08.570 line:82%
"I hope so!" You, you...

2086
02:27:08.654 --> 02:27:10.239 line:82%
"I hope so"?

2087
02:27:10.614 --> 02:27:12.241 line:82%
- Now where's that?
- Who?

2088
02:27:12.325 --> 02:27:14.243 line:82%
- That, that...
- What's that?

2089
02:27:14.326 --> 02:27:17.162 line:82%
- The one who helps me.
- Maid?

2090
02:27:17.246 --> 02:27:18.664 line:82%
- No.
- Oh, shut up, Ron. Nurse?

2091
02:27:18.747 --> 02:27:20.499 line:82%
- Nurse. Where is the nurse?
- How do I know?

2092
02:27:20.582 --> 02:27:22.167 line:82%
- She must be inside!
- Let's go.

2093
02:27:22.251 --> 02:27:24.044 line:82%
- We're dead.
- We're dead.

2094
02:27:24.127 --> 02:27:25.295 line:82%
What kind of guy is this?

2095
02:27:25.379 --> 02:27:27.673 line:82%
Ambar, just do what he tells you to.

2096
02:27:27.756 --> 02:27:30.842 line:82%
Just follow his instructions and try
to relax. Everything will be okay.

2097
02:27:30.926 --> 02:27:33.845 line:82%
Will you please shut up?
I'm getting very confused.

2098
02:27:34.137 --> 02:27:35.970 line:82%
Give me a smile, just one smile.

2099
02:27:36.056 --> 02:27:38.809 line:82%
- What are you doing?
- Give me that thing!

2100
02:27:39.017 --> 02:27:40.852 line:82%
What the hell is happening?

2101
02:27:43.564 --> 02:27:45.107 line:82%
I'm the doctor.

2102
02:27:48.318 --> 02:27:49.736 line:82%
She's ready!

2103
02:27:51.488 --> 02:27:55.803 line:82%
- You have to do that. Do that...
- Do what?

2104
02:27:57.286 --> 02:27:59.140 line:82%
What do you call shoving?

2105
02:27:59.228 --> 02:28:00.999 line:82%
Push! Push! Push! Push!

2106
02:28:02.457 --> 02:28:04.459 line:82%
- It really hurts.
- What?

2107
02:28:04.918 --> 02:28:09.506 line:82%
- I'm in pain.
- Pain? You're in pain?

2108
02:28:09.756 --> 02:28:15.220 line:82%
Come here and make a baby. Then
you'll know what pain is, you bloody man!

2109
02:28:17.055 --> 02:28:18.974 line:82%
Oh, shit! Nurse, look after her.

2110
02:28:19.057 --> 02:28:20.309 line:82%
Coming!

2111
02:28:20.559 --> 02:28:25.063 line:82%
Oh, my god. You're also ready to push.
She needs to push. Push.

2112
02:28:25.272 --> 02:28:27.649 line:82%
- Nick if you faint, I'll kill you!
- Blood.

2113
02:28:28.073 --> 02:28:29.818 line:82%
I can't stand the sight of blood, either.

2114
02:28:29.901 --> 02:28:31.069 line:82%
What?

2115
02:28:31.153 --> 02:28:32.946 line:82%
Just a small problem. Hold her hand.

2116
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:35.907 line:82%
- Actually, hold my hand also.
- Push.

2117
02:28:36.908 --> 02:28:39.119 line:82%
Okay, push.

2118
02:28:39.453 --> 02:28:40.620 line:82%
Nurse, nurse.

2119
02:28:40.704 --> 02:28:42.372 line:82%
Dear God, what a huge needle!

2120
02:28:42.789 --> 02:28:44.648 line:82%
I want that... that...

2121
02:28:44.875 --> 02:28:46.101 line:82%
- Forceps?
- No!

2122
02:28:49.302 --> 02:28:50.678 line:82%
- Cotton swabs?
- No!

2123
02:28:50.881 --> 02:28:52.966 line:82%
What Karan Johar drinks?

2124
02:28:53.342 --> 02:28:55.541 line:82%
- Coffee?
- Coffee! I want some coffee.

2125
02:28:55.758 --> 02:28:59.318 line:82%
Push! Come on sister, you need to push!

2126
02:28:59.514 --> 02:29:03.435 line:82%
Yes baby, yeah baby.
Go for it. Push, push, push.

2127
02:29:04.645 --> 02:29:08.336 line:82%
Come on, come on, you're doing good,
you're doing good! Okay, okay...

2128
02:29:10.377 --> 02:29:12.678 line:82%
All right. Oh my god!

2129
02:29:13.779 --> 02:29:16.490 line:82%
- Congrats. It's a boy!
- It's a boy? It's a boy?

2130
02:29:16.574 --> 02:29:20.867 line:82%
I was told a girl! What are you saying?
There must be one more, check inside!

2131
02:29:20.952 --> 02:29:23.121 line:82%
There has to be a girl,
there has to be a girl!

2132
02:29:24.665 --> 02:29:26.833 line:82%
I'm exhausted.

2133
02:29:29.044 --> 02:29:32.422 line:82%
Excuse me, Doctor.
There's one more patient.

2134
02:29:32.506 --> 02:29:33.507 line:82%
What?

2135
02:29:34.591 --> 02:29:36.093 line:82%
Okay, push.

2136
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:38.762 line:82%
I can see the head.

2137
02:29:38.845 --> 02:29:39.930 line:82%
No, no, hold it.

2138
02:29:40.013 --> 02:29:42.224 line:82%
- What?
- What? Hold what?

2139
02:29:44.059 --> 02:29:48.105 line:82%
Before the babies are born,
please say you'll marry me.

2140
02:29:48.397 --> 02:29:50.440 line:82%
Babies? Double roll?

2141
02:29:51.525 --> 02:29:54.820 line:82%
Why do you want to marry me, Nick?
What's changed?

2142
02:29:54.903 --> 02:29:58.365 line:82%
Everything, since I first met you.

2143
02:29:58.573 --> 02:30:03.704 line:82%
You were pretty, smart, funny.
You were perfect.

2144
02:30:03.787 --> 02:30:06.164 line:82%
And I fell in love with your perfection.

2145
02:30:06.415 --> 02:30:08.333 line:82%
Then I saw your other side.

2146
02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:12.504 line:82%
Your anger, mood swings, your stupidity...

2147
02:30:12.587 --> 02:30:14.572 line:82%
Are you proposing or insulting me?

2148
02:30:14.658 --> 02:30:16.758 line:82%
I saw you screaming for no reason,

2149
02:30:17.035 --> 02:30:21.680 line:82%
fighting without provocation.
I've seen you twice your normal size,

2150
02:30:22.431 --> 02:30:26.435 line:82%
I've seen you throwing up
in my cap, on my carpet.

2151
02:30:26.643 --> 02:30:32.023 line:82%
But my love never lessened.
I don't love you in spite of all this...

2152
02:30:32.983 --> 02:30:37.821 line:82%
I started loving you because of this.
I just kept loving you even more.

2153
02:30:38.447 --> 02:30:40.115 line:82%
I'm not perfect, Ambar.

2154
02:30:41.491 --> 02:30:45.871 line:82%
Neither are you, and life
is never going to be perfect.

2155
02:30:45.954 --> 02:30:50.292 line:82%
But you, you will always
be perfect for me.

2156
02:30:51.001 --> 02:30:54.504 line:82%
I love you, Amby. Please...

2157
02:30:55.839 --> 02:30:57.883 line:82%
please will you marry me?

2158
02:31:09.394 --> 02:31:11.938 line:82%
What happened? What happened?

2159
02:31:12.189 --> 02:31:13.815 line:82%
Beautiful.

2160
02:31:17.235 --> 02:31:19.112 line:82%
Well done, well done!

2161
02:31:19.196 --> 02:31:22.824 line:82%
What do you say on an occasion like this?

2162
02:31:23.241 --> 02:31:24.785 line:82%
What, what?

2163
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:29.414 line:82%
That happy, felicitation type greeting.

2164
02:31:30.165 --> 02:31:33.752 line:82%
- Congratulations?
- Yes. Congratulations!

2165
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:37.589 line:82%
Push baby, push baby!

2166
02:31:37.672 --> 02:31:39.007 line:82%
Push, baby.

2167
02:31:39.090 --> 02:31:41.779 line:82%
Sorry, no baby. Push!

2168
02:31:47.224 --> 02:31:50.602 line:82%
Come on, you can do it.

2169
02:31:53.730 --> 02:31:56.733 line:82%
That's it. You can do it.

2170
02:31:59.528 --> 02:32:01.863 line:82%
You did it, you did it!

2171
02:32:02.113 --> 02:32:03.198 line:82%
I'm so relieved.

2172
02:32:03.490 --> 02:32:04.908 line:82%
Doctor...

2173
02:32:09.412 --> 02:32:13.583 line:82%
- Here you are.
- Not me... he did it.

2174
02:32:14.167 --> 02:32:16.419 line:82%
You did it, man.

2175
02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:19.562 line:82%
One more.

2176
02:32:55.625 --> 02:32:58.003 line:82%
- Where's your wife?
- No idea.

2177
02:32:58.349 --> 02:33:00.839 line:82%
Cathy, where's Cathy?
