[Client1] I decided to marry Rudi
because no matter how tired or drained I am...

2
00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:36.208 line:80%
...going home to him feels like
sinking into the most comfortable couch.

[Chuckle]

4
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.875 line:80%
[Martin] In my opinion, it's hard.

5
00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:46.917 line:80%
People can have all sorts of theories
about why two people are compatible or whatever.

6
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.708 line:80%
But when you meet the person
who's really meant for you...

7
00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:53.333 line:80%
...it just feels different.

8
00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:57.083 line:80%
[Interviewer] Do you think sex is important?

9
00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.583 line:80%
Of course! Super important.

10
00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:04.000 line:80%
I wouldn't want to marry someone
who doesn't even like hugging.

11
00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:10.083 line:80%
[Client 2] Yeah, I think that's a really important point
that helped Sasa and I decide to get married.

12
00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:11.917 line:80%
[Dara] He's the best.

13
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:14.750 line:80%
Really?

14
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:20.875 line:80%
He knows exactly what I like most.

15
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.708 line:80%
That's only half of it, you know.

16
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.042 line:80%
Sex without affection is like...

17
00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:33.208 line:80%
...needing calories from food,
but getting it through an IV.

18
00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:36.958 line:80%
You don't chew it, you don't enjoy it.

19
00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:38.958 line:80%
[Interviewer] So how long
have you guys been married?

20
00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:41.917 line:80%
Two months.

21
00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:48.917 line:80%
But I'm sure that even after 20 years...

22
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.500 line:80%
...it will still feel the same as today.

23
00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:55.708 line:80%
Not just in 20 years, a thousand years.

Your salaries combined with mine for 10 years...

...still won’t be enough to replace it
if it gets ruined.

00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:32.542 line:80%

- Understood?

Hey, Nina. You startled me.

Sir, I need to take a day off work,
so I won't be in tomorrow.

Yeah, I know.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:50.833 line:80%
Your parents are coming to the apartment, right?

52
00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:53.083 line:80%
Oh, yeah, they are.

53
00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:56.458 line:80%
But not until tomorrow, so...

54
00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:59.083 line:80%
My apartment's empty.

55
00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:04.167 line:80%
You should come over and clean up there maybe?

56
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.125 line:80%
You're looking for trouble.

63
00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:23.750 line:80%
But don't straight guys think Nina is super hot?

64
00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.875 line:80%
Totally hot.

- You're not making any moves?

67
00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:34.375 line:80%
- What do you mean?
- Like, anything, Tin.

68
00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:38.083 line:80%
What's your point?

69
00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:40.167 line:80%
Come on, Ton.

70
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.292 line:80%
I'm sure you still believe in monogamy, right?

71
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.917 line:80%
I do, Tin.

72
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.167 line:80%
So?

73
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.417 line:80%
I feel like your relationship with Dara
isn't on fire anymore.

74
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.917 line:80%
You haven't had sex in a while, have you?

75
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.167 line:80%
[Huh]

76
00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.500 line:80%
What's that supposed to mean?

77
00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:56.625 line:80%
How did you know?

78
00:04:58.417 --> 00:05:01.125 line:80%
Just look at your face, Tin.

79
00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:03.667 line:80%
You can't tell the difference
between someone who gets it regularly...

80
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.208 line:80%
...and someone who's dried up?

81
00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:06.583 line:80%
[Martin] You're making stuff up.

82
00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:10.167 line:80%
Mrs. Tuti, wait a sec.

83
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.042 line:80%
Can you help judge between the two of us.

84
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:15.333 line:80%
Which one of us looks like
they have the healthier sex life?

Dry season.

88
00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:26.208 line:80%
Now, leave me alone.

89
00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.667 line:80%
[Anton] Thanks, ma'am!

90
00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:30.083 line:80%
You need help.

91
00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:33.583 line:80%
You're the sick one.
You're the one who needs help, jerk.

- Seriously. Wait, wait.
- What now?

93
00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:38.542 line:80%
This thing can help you.

94
00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:40.583 line:80%

You're nuts. Are you crazy?

96
00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.250 line:80%
This is for women.

97

You want my wife to pleasure herself?
I'd be done for.

98
00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:53.417 line:80%
There's an app for it.

99
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.500 line:80%
You can download it. When your wife is using it….

100
00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:57.167 line:80%
You can be the one controlling that thing,
you know?

101
00:05:58.417 --> 00:06:01.583 line:80%
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Though I've only used it once.

102
00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:04.958 line:80%
- Ick! You jerk.
- No, no, I'm joking, I'm joking!

103
00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:08.583 line:80%
Just kidding, I couldn’t fit into that anyway.
It's too small for me, Tin.

104
00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:13.833 line:80%
- [Anton] Just give it a try. Please?
- Why don't you try it? I'm working.

105
00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:15.042 line:80%
- Seriously, Tin.
- No.

[Martin] A toy, sir.

122
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.208 line:80%
[Security 2] What kind of toy?

123
00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.167 line:80%
[Security 1] Not a contemporary art piece, right?

124
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.708 line:80%
Contemporary piece?

125
00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:04.708 line:80%
[Martin] Of course not!
Are you seriously accusing me?

No, sir.

You're clearly burned out.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.375 line:80%
I don't know if you ask me.

320
00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:56.875 line:80%
Why haven't we gone there again?

321
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.625 line:80%
[Martin] That's where we had our first date.

322
00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:07.083 line:80%
[Dara] Yeah, I have such sweet memories
of that place with you.

323
00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:09.750 line:80%
[Dara] So, I'm afraid to go back.

324
00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:13.292 line:80%
Afraid it'll ruin the memory.

325
00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:14.417 line:80%
[Martin] Why would it be ruined?

326
00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:17.333 line:80%
What if it becomes even better?

327
00:17:18.417 --> 00:17:21.000 line:80%
- We could create a better memory.
- [Dara] Maybe.

328
00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:22.708 line:80%
[Martin] Of course we will.

[Music]

330
00:17:26.417 --> 00:17:28.208 line:80%
[Dara] Why don’t you ever bring this bag out
from the car?

331
00:17:28.292 --> 00:17:31.000 line:80%
Why bother?

332
00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:34.125 line:80%
- [Martin] Everything in it is the same!
- Isn’t there anything that needs to be washed?

333
00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:35.625 line:80%
[Martin] Nope.

[Laugh]

338
00:17:46.583 --> 00:17:53.083 line:80%
[Martin] No, that's Anton's doing.
He gave me "that thing" for us to use.

339
00:17:53.167 --> 00:17:55.708 line:80%
Forget it, we're talking about Anton.
You know how he is.

340
00:17:55.792 --> 00:17:58.875 line:80%
This is the vibrator with the app, right?

341
00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:04.417 line:80%
How do you know that it's a vibrator with an app?

342
00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:08.625 line:80%
There's an ad on Twitter where the girl
uses it at a restaurant...

343
00:18:08.708 --> 00:18:10.875 line:80%
...and the guy controls it with an app.

344
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:15.583 line:80%
So it really is from Anton?

345
00:18:16.333 --> 00:18:18.208 line:80%
Yeah, babe.

346
00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:21.167 line:80%
But now it's ours.

347
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.292 line:80%
[Laugh]

348
00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:23.583 line:80%
Is this used?

349
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.542 line:80%
Of course not!

350
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.417 line:80%
Just put it away.

351
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.458 line:80%
I was already planning to throw it anyway.

352
00:18:33.208 --> 00:18:34.250 line:80%
[Soft thud]

353
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:39.958 line:80%
Honestly, I feel self-conscious going to Goligo.

354
00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:41.500 line:80%
Why?

355
00:18:41.583 --> 00:18:43.708 line:80%
It's a young people's place.

356
00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:46.208 line:80%
[Martin] What do you mean? You feel old?

357
00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.667 line:80%
[Dara] No, not like that.

358
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.500 line:80%
Then it's the perfect place for us.

359
00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:53.000 line:80%
Could be.

360
00:18:53.083 --> 00:18:56.500 line:80%

How many people, Ma'am, Sir?

364

This is the Cafe Goligo, right?

365
00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:15.500 line:80%
Now it's called Goligold. See?

You want to go to a different place?

[Mutter]

370
00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:28.917 line:80%
[Waiter 1] It's nice here now, Ma'am, Sir.

371
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.583 line:80%
There are no teenagers, it’s not noisy.

372
00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:34.000 line:80%
If the teenagers are here, they make the other guests uncomfortable.

373
00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:36.875 line:80%
[Waiter 1] This place is highly recommended
for people like you.

374
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.167 line:80%
It's fine, we can stay.

375
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.833 line:80%
- Okay.
- Our old table is still in the same spot.

376
00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:45.667 line:80%
You still remember.

377
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.542 line:80%
[Waiter 1] Please, Sir, Ma'am.

378
00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:49.458 line:80%
[Martin] Why did they change the name?

379
00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:53.833 line:80%
[Waiter 1] Well, all our menu items are soft, Sir.
Lots of the older people who eat here don't have teeth.

380
00:19:53.917 --> 00:19:56.667 line:80%
[Waiter 1] So, we've become famous
among the elderly.

381
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.333 line:80%
- [Martin] I see.
- [Waiter 1] Yes. Please check the menu.

382
00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:01.208 line:80%
- [Dara] Thank you.
- [Waiter 1] You're welcome.

[Waiter 2] Here.

386
00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:15.042 line:80%
Actually, this place is not bad at all.

387
00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:16.583 line:80%
[Martin] It's kind of nice.

388
00:20:17.792 --> 00:20:22.708 line:80%
[Martin] I mean, everyone here,
even the older people...

389
00:20:22.792 --> 00:20:26.708 line:80%
[MArtin] ...are still romantic, affectionate.
Right?

390
00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.375 line:80%
[Dara] I know, right?

391
00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:30.875 line:80%
So we're not in the wrong place.

392
00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:35.667 line:80%
- [Martin] Oh God.
- [Dara] What?

393
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.208 line:80%
- Look to your right.
- [Dara] Huh?

394
00:20:38.292 --> 00:20:39.625 line:80%
[Martin] Just trust me.

395

[Groan]

396
00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:49.167 line:80%
- That's the worst!
- [Dara] Then stop staring at them.

397
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.125 line:80%
I'm not, but that's just too much.

398
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:54.875 line:80%
That's your issue. You hate seeing affection.

399
00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:59.333 line:80%
No, I love affection. It's cute.

400
00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:01.792 line:80%
[Martin] But that's a no-no.

401
00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:03.458 line:80%
[Laugh]

402
00:21:03.542 --> 00:21:08.250 line:80%
At least this isn't a cafe full of
noisy teens yelling and screaming.

403
00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.750 line:80%
- That would give me a headache.
- [Martin] You're right.

404
00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:10.875 line:80%
I know, right?

405
00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:13.792 line:80%
- [Guest 1] My food is too salty!
- [Guest 2] What?

406
00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:16.500 line:80%
[Guest 1] Too salty! They put too much salt in it!

407
00:21:16.583 --> 00:21:18.583 line:80%
[Guest 2] Termites?

408
00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:23.042 line:80%
[Guest 1] Salt, too much salt!
My food is too salty!

409
00:21:23.125 --> 00:21:26.958 line:80%
Oh, I thought you said termites.
I thought you wanted to eat it with your eyes closed.

410
00:21:27.042 --> 00:21:29.708 line:80%
Well, go ahead and close them.
Eat with your eyes closed.

411
00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:34.292 line:80%
- [Guest 2] Honey, don't be fussy.
- [Guest 1] But it's salty!

412
00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:41.750 line:80%
[Martin] Alright, let's focus
on why we came here, okay?

413
00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:42.917 line:80%
Okay.

414
00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:47.458 line:80%
I want you to know.

415
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.250 line:80%
My love for you hasn't changed
since the first time we met.

416
00:21:54.375 --> 00:21:56.958 line:80%
- Really?
- [Dara] Yeah.

417
00:22:00.375 --> 00:22:04.500 line:80%
Yeah, we're going through something now.

418
00:22:04.583 --> 00:22:07.667 line:80%
But we want to work it out, right?

419
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.250 line:80%
Of course. I agree.

420
00:22:11.542 --> 00:22:12.583 line:80%
[Sigh]

421
00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:17.542 line:80%
Or maybe...

422
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:18.792 line:80%
[Sigh]

423
00:22:21.542 --> 00:22:23.458 line:80%
We're playing it too safe?

424
00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:25.833 line:80%
- Too safe?
- [Dara] Well...

425
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.250 line:80%
When we make love,
I feel like it's just a routine.

426
00:22:28.917 --> 00:22:30.875 line:80%
We've never tried, you know...

427
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:35.583 line:80%
...to spice things up?

428
00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:40.042 line:80%
[Chuckle]

429
00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:45.042 line:80%
Never tried you said?

430
00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:49.375 line:80%
[Martin] Did you forget about that time
in the bathtub when we almost slipped?

431
00:22:49.458 --> 00:22:50.750 line:80%
[Sigh and chuckle]

432
00:22:50.833 --> 00:22:52.417 line:80%
[Martin] Right?

433
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.292 line:80%
That was a slippery tub, love.

434
00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:56.375 line:80%
[Huh]

435
00:22:57.667 --> 00:22:58.708 line:80%
Are you sure?

436
00:23:00.167 --> 00:23:04.667 line:80%
We haven't even done it in our own kitchen.

437
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.208 line:80%
We never leave the bedroom.

in the back of the taxi?

440
00:23:17.292 --> 00:23:18.333 line:80%
Just the two of us?

441
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.250 line:80%
You only touched my thigh,
and the driver was peeing outside.

Let me ask you something.

448
00:23:40.792 --> 00:23:46.958 line:80%
Would you dare to do those things in public?

449
00:23:47.042 --> 00:23:48.083 line:80%
[Martin] Would you?

450
00:23:50.458 --> 00:23:55.125 line:80%
Order me number 17 from the menu,
and a mineral water.

451

- Trust me.

- No, I trust you. But where are you going?
- [Dara] Okay.

[Martin] What? What's this for?

467
00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:42.542 line:80%
I already downloaded the app.

468
00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:44.458 line:80%
- The app?
- [Dara] Uh-huh.

469

- What app?
- "The app".

And now I have to go get it from the car?

474
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:02.958 line:80%

Yeah, nothing really.

00:34:57.625 --> 00:34:59.875 line:80%
[Martin] Well, it's not like we're actually
going to go there, right?

Why not?

[Martin] What if we go
and it turns out to be a scam?

646

Well, if it's not legit, if it's a scam...

649

I mean, when it comes to our names,
addresses, all our info, that's common.

People sell our data to places like that.
That's not unusual, babe.

Fine, if you're not interested.
I have to go to work now.

[Martin] Before we go further,
I have a question that’s bothering me.

719
00:38:50.042 --> 00:38:56.500 line:80%
How did you and your team
know our names and our problems?

720
00:38:56.583 --> 00:38:59.750 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] This clinic works by recommendation.

721
00:39:00.458 --> 00:39:06.000 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] So those who've done therapy before
can recommend friends or loved ones...

722
00:39:06.083 --> 00:39:08.417 line:80%
...with similar issues.

723
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.958 line:80%
For that, they get a 15% cashback.

724
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:17.917 line:80%
- So this is a recommendation from family?
- [Dr. Bandi] Could be, yeah.

725
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.208 line:80%
- Who do you think it is?
- Is it your brother Feri?

726
00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:24.500 line:80%
Feri? No way.

727
00:39:24.583 --> 00:39:27.375 line:80%
His wife gives birth every year.

728
00:39:28.042 --> 00:39:30.167 line:80%
Right.

729
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.417 line:80%
Before we start, I just want to inform you
of something important.

730
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.208 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] Here you go.
The charges are quite high.

731
00:39:36.292 --> 00:39:38.167 line:80%

00:39:52.125 --> 00:39:53.583 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] According to company policy.

737
00:39:55.042 --> 00:39:56.875 line:80%

00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:59.125 line:80%
- 100%?
- [Dr. Bandi] Yes.

739
00:39:59.208 --> 00:40:01.292 line:80%
[Dara] Can I ask something?

740
00:40:01.375 --> 00:40:04.917 line:80%
Out of that 100%,
how many have asked for their money back?

Really?

746
00:40:12.625 --> 00:40:13.875 line:80%
Zero percent?

747
00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:21.458 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] Okay, if you are sure,
we need to get your signature.

748
00:40:21.542 --> 00:40:22.667 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] I'll be right back.

749
00:40:23.708 --> 00:40:24.917 line:80%
Well, are you sure?

750
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.125 line:80%
Zero percent! Full refund guarantee.

751
00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:29.625 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] Okay.

it's 50% upfront...

755
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.375 line:80%
...and then we can begin the therapy.

756
00:40:43.042 --> 00:40:44.250 line:80%
I'll pay now.

[Dr. Bandi] Okay.

762
00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:05.917 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] Then we can begin right away.

763
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.417 line:80%
But for the therapy, you both will be separated.

764
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.708 line:80%
Excuse me? But why?

765
00:41:13.792 --> 00:41:16.292 line:80%
[Dr. Bandi] Because this isn't marriage counseling.

766
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.833 line:80%
It's a spiritual journey.

767
00:41:20.917 --> 00:41:25.083 line:80%
A journey you must take individually.

768
00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:30.500 line:80%
I'll follow your lead. So?

769
00:41:31.417 --> 00:41:33.583 line:80%

[Therapist 2] Hello, good evening.
How are you, Martin?

774
00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:45.083 line:80%
- I'm fine, thanks.
- [Therapist 2] This will of course remain confidential.

775
00:41:45.167 --> 00:41:47.792 line:80%
Even your wife won't know.

776
00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:49.583 line:80%
So you can relax.

777
00:41:49.667 --> 00:41:50.708 line:80%
Okay.

[Therapist 3] What are the things
that you don't like about your husband?

779
00:41:53.708 --> 00:41:56.125 line:80%
[Therapist 3] The more detailed, the better.

780
00:41:56.208 --> 00:42:01.625 line:80%
Isn't this kind of like betraying my husband?

781
00:42:01.708 --> 00:42:03.792 line:80%
By talking about his flaws?

782
00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:07.667 line:80%
I'm here as a certified medical professional.

783
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:11.250 line:80%
I would never tell anyone about this.

784
00:42:11.583 --> 00:42:14.875 line:80%
I don't like it when she uses
her favorite shampoo.

The smell makes me nauseous.

...super cheesy movies.

788
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.833 line:80%
Seriously. And then he dissects them,
analyzes everything.

789
00:42:25.917 --> 00:42:30.833 line:80%
The movies are so shallow.
The dialogues are so cringe.

790
00:42:30.917 --> 00:42:34.125 line:80%
Cupcakes. And she's so proud of her cupcakes.

791
00:42:35.125 --> 00:42:36.458 line:80%
Even though...

792
00:42:36.542 --> 00:42:40.625 line:80%
[Dara] He randomly snorts. Like, out of nowhere.

00:42:40.708 --> 00:42:44.125 line:80%
He will just be sitting there, then suddenly he snorts...

794
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:46.667 line:80%
...like a buffalo.

795
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.500 line:80%
[Therapist 2] What's your fantasy woman like?

796
00:42:49.583 --> 00:42:54.000 line:80%
[Martin] I like women who really need me.

797
00:42:54.083 --> 00:42:58.333 line:80%
Moves slowly, carries himself with grace.

798
00:42:58.417 --> 00:43:00.750 line:80%
Like an aristocrat.

799
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:03.750 line:80%
Helpless. Not independent.

800
00:43:03.833 --> 00:43:07.208 line:80%
Really lets me feel her neediness.

801
00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:10.875 line:80%
Like a fresh graduate. That kind of vibe.

802
00:43:10.958 --> 00:43:15.208 line:80%
With sharp facial features, sharp jawlines.

803
00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:17.958 line:80%
A bit fragile.

804
00:43:18.042 --> 00:43:20.625 line:80%
Not too muscular.

805
00:43:20.708 --> 00:43:24.917 line:80%
Still has love handles, still has a tummy.

806
00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:27.625 line:80%
Eyes that are like...

807
00:43:28.958 --> 00:43:31.042 line:80%
...kind of sleepy-looking.

808
00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:37.375 line:80%
We would watch a film festival movie,
and afterward discuss the film.

809
00:43:37.458 --> 00:43:39.500 line:80%

What did you talk about?

817
00:44:06.042 --> 00:44:07.792 line:80%
Wait, aren't we not supposed to talk about this?

818
00:44:09.208 --> 00:44:12.583 line:80%
I know, I'm just curious.

819
00:44:12.667 --> 00:44:15.667 line:80%

We paid a lot, spent the whole day in the car.

If I may ask, what movie is it?

896

[James] Well, I just find it ironic.

902
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.542 line:80%
They got married to be happy.

903
00:49:10.625 --> 00:49:15.708 line:80%
But in the end, they had to divorce to be happy.

1182

Tell them that it's a sexual therapy clinic
and that we can't have sex?

Because they were successful. Right?

[Martin] Hey, man. Sorry.

How are you, man?

[Passenger] Typical racist.

1278
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.625 line:80%
I feel like I don't even know you anymore.

1279
01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:17.042 line:80%
- What?
- I don't even know you anymore!

1280
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.708 line:80%
[Martin] Hey, just so you know,
I had good intentions in the beginning.

1281
01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:25.000 line:80%
I just wanted to drive home a museum visitor.

1282
01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:28.125 line:80%
[Martin] She's a woman, alone at night.

1283
01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:32.083 line:80%
So I took her home,
she said no one was at her house.

1284
01:11:33.458 --> 01:11:34.875 line:80%
Then I drank.

1285
01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.125 line:80%
Not long after, I blacked out, I was drunk.

1286

- It’s the same for me!
- Same how?

1287
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.125 line:80%
[Dara] I also just wanted to watch
an art house movie, the kind you don't like.

1288
01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:51.958 line:80%
[Dara] Then I drank too.
I don't even remember what happened.

1289

I swear to God.

1290
01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:57.167 line:80%
So that means neither of us did anything wrong.

1291
01:11:58.917 --> 01:12:00.792 line:80%
- What do you mean nothing wrong?
- I mean nothing's wrong!

1292
01:12:00.875 --> 01:12:02.083 line:80%
But something's wrong!

1294

[Dara] Now, this is the punishment.

1295
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.750 line:80%
[Martin] Who's punishing us?

1296
01:12:08.833 --> 01:12:10.083 line:80%
Oh, trying to be all philosophical now?

1297
01:12:10.167 --> 01:12:12.417 line:80%
No one's being philosophical.
I'm asking, who's punishing us, huh?

1298
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:17.208 line:80%
This is clearly blackmail.

[Dr. Bandi] If you want your lives to stay normal

it will be out there forever.

1319

deserve to have a child.

is given to someone else.

[Dara] Maybe I'm just bored.

1578
01:28:05.292 --> 01:28:07.375 line:80%
We're like night and day when it comes to interests.

1579
01:28:08.875 --> 01:28:12.583 line:80%
[Dara] For example, I like jazz music,
he likes new age.

1580
01:28:12.667 --> 01:28:16.375 line:80%
[Dara] In my opinion,
new age should only be played in an elevator.

1581
01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.500 line:80%
I don't like the way she talks to me at all.

1582
01:28:19.958 --> 01:28:22.500 line:80%
Like she is my boss. Bossing me around.

[Martin] Well, when we first got married,
I didn't think much of it.

1584

[Martin] But after 10 years...

1585

...the feeling is not there anymore.

1586
01:28:34.875 --> 01:28:36.125 line:80%
Married to her feels like work.

01:28:36.208 --> 01:28:37.917 line:80%
I Thought about getting a divorce?

Honestly...

1589
01:28:45.083 --> 01:28:46.417 line:80%
...I've thought about it.

1590
01:28:49.625 --> 01:28:53.083 line:80%
Maybe there's a better partner out there.

1593
01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:00.958 line:80%
...might not be such a good idea after all.

[Dara] Sometimes, often, even...

1608
01:29:49.792 --> 01:29:55.292 line:80%
[Dara] ...I close my eyes,
imagining that I'm old...

1609
01:29:57.750 --> 01:30:00.167 line:80%
...and wrinkly, like my grandma.

01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:11.917 line:80%
Then I look around,
who could be my husband in my imagination?

1613
01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:18.417 line:80%

you can't expect things to be like...

[Client] ...they were in the beginning.

1652

A new bike and an old bike,
it'll definitely feel different.

But the old bike is always better.

1654

and gotten better at it.
