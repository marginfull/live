1
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.719 line:83%
Almost.

2
00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:41.638 line:83%
"Almost."

3
00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.558 line:83%
Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure this is our best option?

4
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:49.687 line:83%
- Why can't we just correct the problem?
- Because my fucking' nephew...

5
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.440 line:83%
killed a dog.

6
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.526 line:83%
And he stole a car.

7
00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.196 line:83%
A car...

8
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.325 line:83%
which currently is among our inventory.

9
00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.374 line:83%
So we're giving everything up for a car?

10
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.710 line:83%
It's not just a car.

11
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.047 line:83%
It is John Wick's car.

12
00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:19.133 line:83%
Oh.

13
00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.226 line:83%
Sir, why don't we just give it back?

14
00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.354 line:83%
He killed my nephew.

15
00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:34.232 line:83%
My brother.

16
00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.111 line:83%
And a dozen of my men.

17
00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.365 line:83%
Over his car.

18
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:44.993 line:83%
And a puppy.

19
00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:51.874 line:83%
And you... you think he will stop now?

20
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.251 line:83%
Hmm?

21
00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:58.047 line:83%
Sir, he's one man.

22
00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:00.591 line:83%
Why don't we just eliminate him?

23
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.514 line:83%
John Wick...

24
00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:09.017 line:83%
is a man of focus...

25
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.522 line:83%
commitment...

26
00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.365 line:83%
and sheer fucking' will.

27
00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.425 line:83%
He once killed three men in a bar...

28
00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.927 line:83%
With a pencil. I know. I've heard the story.

29
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.554 line:83%
With a fucking pencil!

30
00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:49.474 line:83%
Who the fuck can do that?

31
00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.478 line:83%
Well, I can assure you

32
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.316 line:83%
that the stories you hear about this man,

33
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:05.406 line:83%
if nothing else, has been watered down.

34
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.089 line:83%
Mr. Wick.

35
00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:49.657 line:83%
Hey, buddy.

36
00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:59.166 line:83%
Hey.

37
00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:07.216 line:83%
Good dog.

38
00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.150 line:83%
- What are you doing, John?
- Looking at you.

39
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.403 line:83%
What are you doing?

40
00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.862 line:83%
I'm waiting for you.

41
00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:31.073 line:83%
Come here.

42
00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:47.881 line:83%
Hey, boy.

43
00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:15.033 line:83%
Nice peaceful place you got here.

44
00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:18.162 line:83%
- Hey, Aurelio.
- Hey.

45
00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:26.003 line:83%
John, what the hell? I thought you loved this car.

46
00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.297 line:83%
What do you think?

47
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.841 line:83%
Well, your motor's about to fall out and...

48
00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:32.968 line:83%
the chassis' all bent up,

49
00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:36.013 line:83%
the... the drive-shaft is all destroyed.

50
00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:38.974 line:83%
And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack in your windshield.

51
00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:42.269 line:83%
I mean... what do I think?

52
00:17:43.812 --> 00:17:45.189 line:83%
I could fix this.

53
00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.150 line:83%
Thanks for finding her.

54
00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:51.361 line:83%
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls. No big deal.

55
00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:55.657 line:83%
Let me know when it's fixed.

56
00:17:56.825 --> 00:18:00.329 line:83%
All right. It'll be ready Christmas...

57
00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:01.747 line:83%
2030.

58
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:41.889 line:83%
Hello, John.

59
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.600 line:83%
Santino.

60
00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.336 line:83%
Good to see you.

61
00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:14.630 line:83%
Good to see you.

62
00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:37.027 line:83%
I was sorry to hear about your wife, John.

63
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:40.656 line:83%
Thank you.

64
00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:43.617 line:83%
Hi.

65
00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:49.289 line:83%
And the dog, does he have a name?

66
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.541 line:83%
No.

67
00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:04.471 line:83%
Listen, John... with all sincerity...

68
00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:07.891 line:83%
I don't want to be here.

69
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.643 line:83%
Please, don't.

70
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.562 line:83%
I'm asking you not to do this.

71
00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:14.731 line:83%
I'm sorry.

72
00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:25.409 line:83%
No one gets out and comes back without repercussions.

73
00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:30.080 line:83%
I do this with a heavy heart, John.

74
00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:37.170 line:83%
But remember, if not for what I did

75
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:40.298 line:83%
on the night of your impossible task,

76
00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:44.386 line:83%
you wouldn't be here right now, like this.

77
00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:47.389 line:83%
This is because of me.

78
00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:49.016 line:83%
This, in part, is mine.

79
00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:52.144 line:83%
Take it back.

80
00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:53.520 line:83%
- "Take it back"?
- Take it back.

81
00:21:54.354 --> 00:21:57.190 line:83%
A marker is no small thing, John.

82
00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:00.610 line:83%
For a man to grant a marker to another,

83
00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:04.197 line:83%
is to bind a soul to a blood oath.

84
00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:10.203 line:83%
Find someone else.

85
00:22:13.957 --> 00:22:15.375 line:83%
Listen to me.

86
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.877 line:83%
What is this? Hmm?

87
00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:20.338 line:83%
Do you remember? This is your blood.

88
00:22:21.548 --> 00:22:24.384 line:83%
You came to me. I helped you.

89
00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:28.221 line:83%
If you don't do this,

90
00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:30.599 line:83%
you know the consequences.

91
00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:34.686 line:83%
I'm not that guy anymore.

92
00:22:39.107 --> 00:22:41.151 line:83%
You are always that guy, John.

93
00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:47.324 line:83%
I can't help you.

94
00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:00.962 line:83%
I'm sorry.

95
00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:16.645 line:83%
Yes. You're right.

96
00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:18.772 line:83%
You can't.

97
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.236 line:83%
But he can.

98
00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:25.946 line:83%
I'll see you soon, John.

99
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.585 line:83%
You have a beautiful home, John.

100
00:25:57.597 --> 00:25:59.557 line:83%
Well, good evening', John.

101
00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:01.851 line:83%
Hey, Jimmy.

102
00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:05.522 line:83%
Gas leak?

103
00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:09.109 line:83%
Yeah, gas leak.

104
00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:12.362 line:83%
You working' again?

105
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.658 line:83%
I'll see you, Jimmy.

106
00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:19.744 line:83%
Come on, boy.

107
00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.541 line:83%
'Night, John.

108
00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:28.295 line:83%
Oh, shit.

109
00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:13.840 line:83%
I'd like to see the manager.

110
00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:16.634 line:83%
How good to see you again so soon, Mr. Wick.

111
00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:18.928 line:83%
Shall I announce you?

112
00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:21.264 line:83%
Yes, please.

113
00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:23.767 line:83%
Stay.

114
00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:34.110 line:83%
Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.

115
00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:48.666 line:83%
Impeccable.

116
00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:53.838 line:83%
Put these into circulation.

117
00:28:07.685 --> 00:28:08.895 line:83%
Where is he?

118
00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:12.649 line:83%
Thank you, my friend.

119
00:28:12.732 --> 00:28:14.776 line:83%
Beautiful work. Beautiful.

120
00:28:22.075 --> 00:28:23.701 line:83%
What are you doing, Jonathan?

121
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.330 line:83%
He burned my house down.

122
00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:30.583 line:83%
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

123
00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:36.214 line:83%
What the hell were you thinking,
giving a marker to a man like Santino D'Antonio?

124
00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:38.883 line:83%
It was the only way I could get out.

125
00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:41.886 line:83%
Oh. You call this "out"?

126
00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:46.015 line:83%
What did you think was gonna happen? Huh?

127
00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:47.892 line:83%
What did you expect? Huh?

128
00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:51.604 line:83%
Did you really think this day
was never going to come? Hmm?

129
00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.733 line:83%
What does he want you to do?

130
00:28:57.861 --> 00:28:59.195 line:83%
I didn't ask.

131
00:29:00.196 --> 00:29:01.406 line:83%
I just said no.

132
00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:07.120 line:83%
Two rules that cannot be broken, Jonathan.

133
00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:12.125 line:83%
No blood on Continental grounds,
and every marker must be honored.

134
00:29:13.376 --> 00:29:16.880 line:83%
Now while my judgment comes
in the form of excommunicado,

135
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:19.757 line:83%
the High Table

136
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:23.011 line:83%
demand a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.

137
00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:26.222 line:83%
I have no choice?

138
00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:29.476 line:83%
You dishonor the marker, you die.

139
00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:31.686 line:83%
You kill the holder of the marker, you die.

140
00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:33.897 line:83%
You run, you die.

141
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.567 line:83%
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.

142
00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:40.236 line:83%
Do what the man asks.

143
00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:42.822 line:83%
Be free.

144
00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:48.077 line:83%
Then, if you want to go after him,
burn his house down, be my guest.

145
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:49.496 line:83%
But until then...

146
00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:53.374 line:83%
Rules.

147
00:29:54.417 --> 00:29:57.378 line:83%
Exactly. Rules.

148
00:29:57.504 --> 00:29:59.756 line:83%
Without them, we'd live with the animals.

149
00:30:08.264 --> 00:30:09.641 line:83%
Do you board?

150
00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:13.978 line:83%
I'm sorry to say, sir, but this facility does not.

151
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:21.402 line:83%
I, however, would be willing to accept
the responsibility, should you wish.

152
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:24.447 line:83%
Appreciate that.

153
00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:26.241 line:83%
Does he have a name, sir?

154
00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:27.325 line:83%
No.

155
00:30:27.408 --> 00:30:29.536 line:83%
Good dog.

156
00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.371 line:83%
Stay.

157
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:37.437 line:83%
This was my father's collection.

158
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.233 line:83%
I see little more than just
paint on canvas, of course.

159
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.529 line:83%
But I do find myself here.

160
00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:49.741 line:83%
Please.

161
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.088 line:83%
I didn't want to do this, John.

162
00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:08.593 line:83%
Had you stayed retired, I would have respected it.

163
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.804 line:83%
Look at you.

164
00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:15.141 line:83%
You're thinking' about it, aren't you?

165
00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:19.896 line:83%
You're counting exits... guards...

166
00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.608 line:83%
Could you get to me in time?

167
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:27.737 line:83%
How would you do it, I wonder?

168
00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:30.948 line:83%
That woman's pen?

169
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:34.494 line:83%
His cane?

170
00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:37.955 line:83%
Maybe his glasses?

171
00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:40.625 line:83%
My hands.

172
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:45.046 line:83%
Ah. How exciting.

173
00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:47.757 line:83%
Yet you know you cannot, can you?

174
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:52.845 line:83%
I told you I needed that guy,

175
00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:55.223 line:83%
the way you are looking at me right now.

176
00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:58.810 line:83%
I needed the Boogeyman.

177
00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:00.395 line:83%
I needed John Wick.

178
00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:03.398 line:83%
Just... tell me what you want.

179
00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:11.280 line:83%
I want you to kill my sister.

180
00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:14.617 line:83%
Why?

181
00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:18.037 line:83%
There are 12 seats at the High Table.

182
00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:22.291 line:83%
Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

183
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.212 line:83%
The Chinese, the Russian.

184
00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.549 line:83%
When my father died...

185
00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.261 line:83%
he willed his seat to her.

186
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.890 line:83%
She represents Camorra now.

187
00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:40.309 line:83%
And I can't help but wonder...

188
00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:44.230 line:83%
what I might accomplish in her stead.

189
00:33:46.065 --> 00:33:51.571 line:83%
You want me to kill... Gianna D'Antonio?

190
00:33:54.282 --> 00:33:55.491 line:83%
I could never do it.

191
00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:58.161 line:83%
She is my blood.

192
00:33:58.244 --> 00:33:59.328 line:83%
I still love her.

193
00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:01.873 line:83%
It can't be done.

194
00:34:01.956 --> 00:34:05.501 line:83%
She's in Rome for her coronation.

195
00:34:06.502 --> 00:34:11.048 line:83%
- You will take the catacombs in...
- It doesn't matter where she is.

196
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:16.262 line:83%
That's why I need the ghost, The specturm, John Wick.

197
00:34:17.263 --> 00:34:19.098 line:83%
That's why I need you.

198
00:34:20.183 --> 00:34:21.434 line:83%
Do this for me,

199
00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:24.353 line:83%
and your marker is honored.

200
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.356 line:83%
What say you?

201
00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:36.991 line:83%
Never one to waste words.

202
00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:56.010 line:83%
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.

203
00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.593 line:83%
Jonathan!

204
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:03.346 line:83%
Julius.

205
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:07.308 line:83%
- Ciao.
- Nice to see you.

206
00:37:13.105 --> 00:37:16.317 line:83%
I fail to recall the last time you were in Rome.

207
00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:18.861 line:83%
And here I'd heard

208
00:37:19.862 --> 00:37:21.113 line:83%
you had retired.

209
00:37:22.698 --> 00:37:23.866 line:83%
I had.

210
00:37:25.117 --> 00:37:28.621 line:83%
Then humor me with, uh... but one question.

211
00:37:38.714 --> 00:37:39.882 line:83%
No.

212
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:43.511 line:83%
All right, then.

213
00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:52.061 line:83%
One of our finest rooms.

214
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.611 line:83%
Enjoy your stay.

215
00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:09.120 line:83%
Mr. Wick.

216
00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:30.141 line:83%
Is the sommelier in?

217
00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:32.101 line:83%
I have never known him not to be.

218
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.827 line:83%
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

219
00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:52.705 line:83%
It's been a long time.

220
00:38:52.788 --> 00:38:54.373 line:83%
I'd like a tasting.

221
00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:57.418 line:83%
I am quite excited to show you something.

222
00:38:58.878 --> 00:38:59.879 line:83%
First...

223
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.890 line:83%
Welcome back to Rome.

224
00:39:13.809 --> 00:39:14.560 line:83%
I am.

225
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.064 line:83%
I know of your past fondness for the German varietals,

226
00:39:18.064 --> 00:39:22.234 line:83%
but I can wholeheartedly
endorse the new breed of Austrians.

227
00:39:23.235 --> 00:39:25.946 line:83%
Glock.34 and.26.

228
00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:29.742 line:83%
This is the original map of the D'Antonio estate.

229
00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:32.328 line:83%
Here, you have all the ancient ruins.

230
00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:38.834 line:83%
Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or a social affair?

231
00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:42.797 line:83%
- Social.
- And is this for day or evening?

232
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.132 line:83%
I need one for day and one for night.

233
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.425 line:83%
Re-contoured grips.

234
00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:50.513 line:83%
Flared mag-well for easier reloads.

235
00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:52.973 line:83%
And I know you'll appreciate the custom porting.

236
00:39:55.976 --> 00:39:57.478 line:83%
What's next?

237
00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:01.190 line:83%
I need something robust. Precise.

238
00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:04.110 line:83%
"Robust. Precise."

239
00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:10.783 line:83%
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

240
00:40:10.866 --> 00:40:12.618 line:83%
- In what style?
- Italian.

241
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:14.286 line:83%
- How many buttons?
- Two.

242
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.038 line:83%
- Trousers?
- Tapered.

243
00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:17.331 line:83%
How about the lining?

244
00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:18.999 line:83%
Tactical.

245
00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:24.171 line:83%
AR-15, 11.5-inch.

246
00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:27.174 line:83%
Compensated with an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

247
00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:30.219 line:83%
Trijicon accupoint with one-six magnification.

248
00:40:30.302 --> 00:40:34.390 line:83%
And this is the modern blueprint.

249
00:40:34.473 --> 00:40:37.810 line:83%
There are one, two, three gates.

250
00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:43.357 line:83%
Silicon carbide discs. Ceramic matrices.

251
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.067 line:83%
Accompanying laminates.

252
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:46.902 line:83%
Cutting-edge body armor.

253
00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:50.698 line:83%
We just sew it between the fabric and the lining.

254
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:53.451 line:83%
Zero penetration. However...

255
00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:56.245 line:83%
quite painful, I'm afraid.

256
00:40:56.328 --> 00:40:59.665 line:83%
Could you recommend anything for the end of the night?

257
00:40:59.748 --> 00:41:01.876 line:83%
Something big, bold.

258
00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:05.337 line:83%
May I suggest the Benelli M4?

259
00:41:09.925 --> 00:41:11.969 line:83%
Custom bolt carrier release and charging handle.

260
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.223 line:83%
Textured grips, should your hands get... wet.

261
00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:21.187 line:83%
An Italian classic.

262
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:22.313 line:83%
Dessert?

263
00:41:22.396 --> 00:41:24.523 line:83%
Dessert.

264
00:41:25.524 --> 00:41:29.320 line:83%
The finest cutlery. All freshly stoned.

265
00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.331 line:83%
Well done.

266
00:41:40.414 --> 00:41:42.374 line:83%
- Could you do a rush order?
- I sure can.

267
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.293 line:83%
Where would you like to have it sent?

268
00:41:44.376 --> 00:41:45.377 line:83%
The hotel.

269
00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:47.213 line:83%
Shall I have everything sent to your room?

270
00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.382 line:83%
- Yes. Thank you.
- Excellent.

271
00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:53.177 line:83%
Mr. Wick?

272
00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:58.724 line:83%
Do enjoy your party.

273
00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:54.334 line:83%
Good evening.

274
00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:57.212 line:83%
Are you enjoying the party?

275
00:46:45.552 --> 00:46:47.054 line:83%
Mr. Akoni.

276
00:46:52.434 --> 00:46:54.436 line:83%
Are you enjoying the festivities?

277
00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.651 line:83%
Please. Sit.

278
00:47:04.863 --> 00:47:06.615 line:83%
Ms. D'Antonio,

279
00:47:06.698 --> 00:47:08.867 line:83%
you can't just take what is rightfully mine...

280
00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:10.160 line:83%
Nothing was taken.

281
00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:14.748 line:83%
Those among your own
came to us with these territories.

282
00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:16.416 line:83%
A knife was pressed to their throats.

283
00:47:17.417 --> 00:47:18.418 line:83%
Semantics.

284
00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:20.462 line:83%
Besides...

285
00:47:21.463 --> 00:47:24.800 line:83%
That blade you speak of was meant for their children.

286
00:47:26.134 --> 00:47:28.470 line:83%
They were only meant to watch.

287
00:47:29.596 --> 00:47:33.267 line:83%
What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.

288
00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:36.520 line:83%
Now go.

289
00:47:39.648 --> 00:47:41.024 line:83%
Enjoy the party.

290
00:47:42.568 --> 00:47:44.069 line:83%
Have some fun.

291
00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:44.046 line:83%
John.

292
00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:47.132 line:83%
Gianna.

293
00:48:53.388 --> 00:48:58.727 line:83%
There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us as friends.

294
00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.774 line:83%
I still do.

295
00:49:07.527 --> 00:49:08.737 line:83%
Yet here you are.

296
00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:18.038 line:83%
What brought you back, John?

297
00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:20.874 line:83%
A marker.

298
00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.044 line:83%
Held by?

299
00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:27.923 line:83%
Your brother.

300
00:49:35.847 --> 00:49:37.057 line:83%
Tell me, John.

301
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.601 line:83%
This marker...

302
00:49:41.103 --> 00:49:42.646 line:83%
Is it how you got out?

303
00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:46.566 line:83%
And what was her name,

304
00:49:47.567 --> 00:49:50.195 line:83%
this woman whose life has ended my own?

305
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:54.074 line:83%
Helen.

306
00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:56.284 line:83%
"Helen."

307
00:49:59.454 --> 00:50:00.956 line:83%
This Helen...

308
00:50:02.874 --> 00:50:05.961 line:83%
was she worth the price that you now seek to pay?

309
00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:14.302 line:83%
Now...

310
00:50:16.888 --> 00:50:19.307 line:83%
let me tell you what happens when I die.

311
00:50:20.308 --> 00:50:23.478 line:83%
Santino will lay claim to my seat at the Table.

312
00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:26.606 line:83%
He will take New York.

313
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.988 line:83%
And you...
will have been the one who gifted it to him.

314
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.874 line:83%
What would your Helen think about that, John?

315
00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:47.604 line:83%
What would your Helen think about you?

316
00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:49.731 line:83%
Hmm?

317
00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:06.206 line:83%
Why?

318
00:52:11.586 --> 00:52:13.171 line:83%
Because...

319
00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:16.466 line:83%
I lived my life my way.

320
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:20.178 line:83%
And I'll die my way.

321
00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:37.988 line:83%
Do you fear damnation, John?

322
00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:41.199 line:83%
Yes.

323
00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:49.249 line:83%
You know,

324
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:53.753 line:83%
I always thought I could escape it.

325
00:52:55.714 --> 00:52:57.757 line:83%
That I'd see it coming.

326
00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:03.305 line:83%
That I'd see you.

327
00:54:16.044 --> 00:54:17.212 line:83%
John?

328
00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.260 line:83%
Cassian.

329
00:54:26.721 --> 00:54:27.806 line:83%
You working?

330
00:54:30.308 --> 00:54:32.102 line:83%
Yeah.

331
00:54:32.185 --> 00:54:33.186 line:83%
You?

332
00:54:34.646 --> 00:54:35.772 line:83%
Yeah.

333
00:54:39.234 --> 00:54:40.402 line:83%
Good night?

334
00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:44.489 line:83%
Afraid so.

335
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.243 line:83%
I'm sorry to hear that.

336
00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:51.634 line:83%
Loose ends?

337
00:57:59.184 --> 00:58:00.518 line:83%
Yeah...

338
01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.657 line:83%
You're not having' a good night, are you, John?

339
01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:51.429 line:83%
Gentlemen!

340
01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.057 line:83%
Gentlemen!

341
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.071 line:83%
Do I need to remind you

342
01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:10.781 line:83%
that there will be no business

343
01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.451 line:83%
conducted on the Continental grounds?

344
01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:18.414 line:83%
No, sir.

345
01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:21.208 line:83%
Bene.

346
01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:27.632 line:83%
Now, may I suggest a visit to the bar,

347
01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.216 line:83%
so you can calm yourselves.

348
01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.181 line:83%
Gin, wasn't it?

349
01:05:36.223 --> 01:05:37.391 line:83%
Yes.

350
01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:41.771 line:83%
Bourbon, right?

351
01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.273 line:83%
Yeah.

352
01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:12.426 line:83%
I had a marker.

353
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.638 line:83%
Whose?

354
01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:18.224 line:83%
Her brother.

355
01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:24.563 line:83%
I see.

356
01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:27.942 line:83%
You had no choice.

357
01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.032 line:83%
He wants her seat at the Table.

358
01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:38.452 line:83%
He will get it now.

359
01:06:41.455 --> 01:06:42.623 line:83%
Yeah.

360
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.418 line:83%
Yeah.

361
01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:49.463 line:83%
So you're free.

362
01:06:56.303 --> 01:06:57.471 line:83%
Am I?

363
01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.016 line:83%
No.

364
01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:04.395 line:83%
Not at all.

365
01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:11.152 line:83%
You killed my ward. Someone I was close to.

366
01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:14.989 line:83%
An eye for an eye, John.

367
01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:18.075 line:83%
You know how it goes.

368
01:07:20.494 --> 01:07:21.537 line:83%
Yeah.

369
01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.587 line:83%
I'll make it quick.

370
01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.256 line:83%
I promise.

371
01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:35.885 line:83%
I appreciate that.

372
01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:39.096 line:83%
I'll try and do the same.

373
01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.065 line:83%
This round's on me.

374
01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:55.529 line:83%
Consider it a professional courtesy.

375
01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:31.774 line:83%
No. Thanks.

376
01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.589 line:83%
Hello, John.

377
01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.966 line:83%
I understand if you're upset.

378
01:09:39.049 --> 01:09:41.760 line:83%
And I know it might feel personal.

379
01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.138 line:83%
But what kind of man would I be

380
01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:46.640 line:83%
if I didn't avenge my sister's murder?

381
01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.018 line:83%
John?

382
01:10:05.784 --> 01:10:09.330 line:83%
Could you let management know
I'll be checking out in the morning.

383
01:10:47.701 --> 01:10:50.371 line:83%
Operator. How may I direct your call?

384
01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:52.706 line:83%
- Accounts payable.
- One moment, please.

385
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.763 line:83%
Accounts payable. How may I help you?

386
01:11:07.846 --> 01:11:09.223 line:83%
I'd like to open an account.

387
01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.642 line:83%
- Name on the account?
- John Wick.

388
01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:13.352 line:83%
Verification?

389
01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.270 line:83%
9305-05.

390
01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:18.399 line:83%
State of contract?

391
01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:21.277 line:83%
- Open.
- Denomination?

392
01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:24.029 line:83%
Seven million.

393
01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.240 line:83%
Processing. Please hold.

394
01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:32.287 line:83%
- I appreciate the service.
- My pleasure.

395
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:34.581 line:83%
You will find safe passage below.

396
01:11:38.585 --> 01:11:40.379 line:83%
Transportation is waiting for you.

397
01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:46.635 line:83%
May you have a safe journey, Mr. Wick.

398
01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.061 line:83%
Order confirmed.

399
01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:25.192 line:83%
- What is this?
- He completed the task.

400
01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:28.278 line:83%
The marker is over.

401
01:13:29.279 --> 01:13:30.280 line:83%
Mark it.

402
01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:34.118 line:83%
If Mr. Wick isn't dead already,

403
01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:35.536 line:83%
he soon will be.

404
01:13:38.038 --> 01:13:40.749 line:83%
Will you mark it, sir?

405
01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:57.850 line:83%
You have no idea what's coming, do you?

406
01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:03.188 line:83%
I have everyone in New York looking for him.

407
01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.607 line:83%
I doubt we will see him again.

408
01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:09.778 line:83%
Do you now?

409
01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:14.449 line:83%
You stabbed the devil in the back

410
01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:17.744 line:83%
and forced him back into
the life that he had just left.

411
01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:22.499 line:83%
You incinerated the priest's temple.

412
01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:23.750 line:83%
Burned it to the ground.

413
01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:28.797 line:83%
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?

414
01:14:31.508 --> 01:14:34.094 line:83%
He had a glimpse of the other side

415
01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:35.721 line:83%
and he embraced it.

416
01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.681 line:83%
But you, Mr. D'Antonio...

417
01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.058 line:83%
took it away from him.

418
01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:42.561 line:83%
He was already back.

419
01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:45.230 line:83%
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.

420
01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.774 line:83%
He owed me. I had every right.

421
01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:51.778 line:83%
And now he's coming again.

422
01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:55.449 line:83%
He did tell you not to do this.

423
01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:00.120 line:83%
He did warn you.

424
01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.165 line:83%
Goodbye, Santino.

425
01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:11.872 line:83%
Please notify MTA personnel of
any suspicious activity.

426
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.756 line:83%
Your attention, please.

427
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.302 line:83%
The Broad Street bound C train is now arriving.

428
01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:28.221 line:83%
Your attention, please.

429
01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:31.683 line:83%
The Broad Street bound C train is now arriving.

430
01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.407 line:83%
Next stop, Canal Street.

431
01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:09.554 line:83%
This is Canal Street.

432
01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:15.435 line:83%
This is the Broad Street bound C train.

433
01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:17.813 line:83%
Next stop is Rector Street.

434
01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:45.006 line:83%
This is Rector Street.

435
01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:52.889 line:83%
This is the Broad Street bound C train.

436
01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:56.226 line:83%
The next stop is Broad Street.

437
01:22:19.392 --> 01:22:21.770 line:83%
This is Broad Street.

438
01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:24.522 line:83%
This is the last stop on the southbound C train.

439
01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:26.816 line:83%
The blade is in your aorta.

440
01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.069 line:83%
You pull it out, you will bleed, and you will die.

441
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:32.280 line:83%
This is the end of the line.

442
01:22:34.991 --> 01:22:37.369 line:83%
Consider this a professional courtesy.

443
01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:40.372 line:83%
This is Broad Street.

444
01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:43.541 line:83%
This is the last stop on the southbound C train.

445
01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:47.379 line:83%
This is the end of the line.

446
01:23:22.872 --> 01:23:26.501 line:83%
We see things, we see things.

447
01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:29.879 line:83%
The things you see are nightmares, man.

448
01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:32.048 line:83%
Like this one time...

449
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:36.886 line:83%
Take me to him.

450
01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:42.058 line:83%
Tell him it's John Wick.

451
01:23:58.116 --> 01:24:01.077 line:83%
You know, they just... they put it in everything!

452
01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:03.413 line:83%
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

453
01:25:54.065 --> 01:25:56.025 line:83%
As I live and breathe!

454
01:25:57.193 --> 01:25:58.695 line:83%
John Wick.

455
01:25:59.696 --> 01:26:00.697 line:83%
The man.

456
01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:03.199 line:83%
The myth.

457
01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:05.702 line:83%
The legend.

458
01:26:05.785 --> 01:26:09.080 line:83%
You're not very good at retiring.

459
01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.832 line:83%
I'm working' on it.

460
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.461 line:83%
Mr. Wick doesn't remember, but we met many years ago,

461
01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:17.338 line:83%
before my ascension...

462
01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:21.301 line:83%
When I was just a pawn in the game.

463
01:26:23.136 --> 01:26:25.847 line:83%
We met and you gave me a gift,

464
01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:27.682 line:83%
the gift that would make me a king.

465
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:33.479 line:83%
You don't remember, but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

466
01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:36.733 line:83%
I didn't even hear you coming'.

467
01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:42.572 line:83%
You gave me this.

468
01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:48.453 line:83%
Gift from the Boogeyman.

469
01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.956 line:83%
Perfect for every occasion.

470
01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.836 line:83%
But you also gave me a choice.

471
01:26:57.962 --> 01:27:01.799 line:83%
Pull my gun, shoot you in the back, and die,

472
01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:04.093 line:83%
or keep the pressure on my neck...

473
01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.763 line:83%
and live.

474
01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.600 line:83%
And so you see, I survived.

475
01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.897 line:83%
No one sneaks up on me anymore, thanks to you.

476
01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:20.568 line:83%
I am all-seeing and all-knowing.

477
01:27:22.528 --> 01:27:24.656 line:83%
Then you know why I'm here.

478
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:29.744 line:83%
Santino D'Antonio, yes.

479
01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:32.455 line:83%
Your contract went wide, John.

480
01:27:33.539 --> 01:27:35.416 line:83%
That's bad for your health.

481
01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:38.252 line:83%
What's the number up to now, Earl?

482
01:27:39.545 --> 01:27:41.756 line:83%
Seven million dollars!

483
01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:42.840 line:83%
Damn!

484
01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:47.053 line:83%
It's Christmas. We're going to Apple-beeâ€™s after this.

485
01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.976 line:83%
I need your help.

486
01:27:53.059 --> 01:27:56.813 line:83%
You have eyes begging for change
on every corner in the city.

487
01:27:56.896 --> 01:27:59.065 line:83%
I'm thinking' you can find Santino.

488
01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:03.152 line:83%
I need you to move me. Underground.

489
01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:04.529 line:83%
Get me to him.

490
01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:08.032 line:83%
How sweet it is!

491
01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:11.619 line:83%
The Boogeyman begging me for help.

492
01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:13.538 line:83%
Well, of course, John.

493
01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:16.207 line:83%
Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.

494
01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:19.043 line:83%
Would you like a back rub with that, John?

495
01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:21.754 line:83%
You're going to help me.

496
01:28:23.047 --> 01:28:25.258 line:83%
Why the fuck would I do that?

497
01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:29.429 line:83%
Because I'm the only one that can help you.

498
01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:49.449 line:83%
You're gonna help me out?

499
01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:53.411 line:83%
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.

500
01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:57.206 line:83%
You sound positively magnanimous.

501
01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.543 line:83%
But look around you.

502
01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:04.130 line:83%
How much help does it look like I need?

503
01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:16.059 line:83%
It seems to me that the real question, Mr. Wick,

504
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:21.355 line:83%
is who in this cruel world of ours...
is going to help you?

505
01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:37.371 line:83%
There's a storm coming.

506
01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:41.125 line:83%
Not just for me. For all of us.

507
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:43.753 line:83%
For everyone under the Table.

508
01:29:43.836 --> 01:29:47.548 line:83%
Yes, killing someone who has a seat
at the High Table does create a problem.

509
01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:49.467 line:83%
But it's your problem, baby.

510
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:55.098 line:83%
After all, none of my people sent Gianna D'Antonio...

511
01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:56.808 line:83%
to the hereafter.

512
01:29:58.309 --> 01:30:02.188 line:83%
That being said, Santino has her seat now.

513
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:04.482 line:83%
And he wants the city.

514
01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:08.569 line:83%
When he's done uptown,
you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?

515
01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:12.573 line:83%
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.

516
01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:13.825 line:83%
Oh, yeah?

517
01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:16.327 line:83%
For how long?

518
01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:17.703 line:83%
And how much blood?

519
01:30:18.704 --> 01:30:20.456 line:83%
You kill Santino,

520
01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.042 line:83%
the Camorra, and the High Table come for you.

521
01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:27.630 line:83%
I kill Santino, they come for me.

522
01:30:29.006 --> 01:30:31.676 line:83%
He's offered $7 million for your life.

523
01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:37.014 line:83%
Seven million dollars is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

524
01:30:43.187 --> 01:30:45.148 line:83%
So I guess you have a choice.

525
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:47.942 line:83%
You want a war?

526
01:30:48.025 --> 01:30:50.361 line:83%
Or do you wanna just give me a gun?

527
01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:05.918 line:83%
Somebody, please! Get this man a gun!

528
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:15.469 line:83%
Kimber 1911,.45 ACP.

529
01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:20.558 line:83%
Seven-round capacity.

530
01:31:28.941 --> 01:31:30.151 line:83%
Seven rounds?

531
01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:34.822 line:83%
Seven million dollars gets you seven rounds.

532
01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:38.409 line:83%
That's a million dollars a round, baby.

533
01:31:50.129 --> 01:31:51.130 line:83%
Let's go.

534
01:31:52.798 --> 01:31:55.426 line:83%
Your descent into Hell begins here, Mr. Wick.

535
01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:56.761 line:83%
He's at the museum.

536
01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:58.471 line:83%
Earl will guide you.

537
01:31:58.554 --> 01:32:00.806 line:83%
Do be careful on your way down.

538
01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:05.811 line:83%
Oh, and remember... you owe me.

539
01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:09.315 line:83%
You don't want me owing you.

540
01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:40.680 line:83%
Welcome, everyone.

541
01:32:40.763 --> 01:32:43.933 line:83%
Let us toast to the future of the High Table

542
01:32:44.016 --> 01:32:47.144 line:83%
and of course, to the memory of my dear sister.

543
01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:06.122 line:83%
Nice to see you.

544
01:33:16.048 --> 01:33:17.675 line:83%
Mr. Akoni, how are you?

545
01:34:14.398 --> 01:34:16.108 line:83%
Wick is here.

546
01:34:16.192 --> 01:34:17.193 line:83%
Yeah.

547
01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:11.288 line:83%
You and you, with me. You, go.

548
01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:29.408 line:83%
Welcome to "Reflections of the Soul"

549
01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:31.744 line:83%
at the New Modern NYC.

550
01:36:33.245 --> 01:36:34.914 line:83%
Within this exhibition,

551
01:36:34.997 --> 01:36:38.250 line:83%
the interplay of light and the nature of self-images

552
01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:40.294 line:83%
coalesce to provide an experience

553
01:36:40.377 --> 01:36:42.505 line:83%
which will highlight the fragility

554
01:36:42.588 --> 01:36:46.550 line:83%
of our perception of space and our place within it.

555
01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:49.887 line:83%
We hope through this exhibit
we can provide new insights

556
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.014 line:83%
into your understanding of the world,

557
01:36:52.097 --> 01:36:55.601 line:83%
and just possibly lead you to deeper reflection

558
01:36:55.684 --> 01:36:57.269 line:83%
into the nature of self.

559
01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:15.204 line:83%
The marker is complete, John.

560
01:37:15.287 --> 01:37:16.872 line:83%
You should have just run away.

561
01:37:27.466 --> 01:37:29.677 line:83%
You know what the Camorra will do to you.

562
01:37:31.387 --> 01:37:33.222 line:83%
You think you're Old Testament?

563
01:37:34.223 --> 01:37:35.641 line:83%
No, John.

564
01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:39.019 line:83%
No.

565
01:37:41.564 --> 01:37:43.440 line:83%
Killing me won't stop the contract.

566
01:37:45.150 --> 01:37:48.988 line:83%
Killing me will make it so much worse.

567
01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:53.158 line:83%
John...

568
01:37:54.577 --> 01:37:55.744 line:83%
you know what I think?

569
01:37:58.414 --> 01:38:00.749 line:83%
I think you are addicted to it.

570
01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:01.834 line:83%
To the vengeance.

571
01:38:19.935 --> 01:38:22.563 line:83%
Welcome to "Reflections of the Soul"

572
01:38:22.646 --> 01:38:25.524 line:83%
at the New Modern NYC.

573
01:38:28.277 --> 01:38:29.528 line:83%
No wife.

574
01:38:31.196 --> 01:38:32.531 line:83%
No life.

575
01:38:34.783 --> 01:38:35.784 line:83%
No home.

576
01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:40.706 line:83%
Vengeance... it's all you have.

577
01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:44.543 line:83%
You wanted me back.

578
01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:46.629 line:83%
I'm back.

579
01:41:42.846 --> 01:41:44.473 line:83%
"You are now exiting"

580
01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:50.938 line:83%
We hope that your journey through the exhibit

581
01:41:51.063 --> 01:41:53.816 line:83%
has been one of reflective contemplation

582
01:41:53.899 --> 01:41:56.401 line:83%
allowing for a new perspective and insight.

583
01:42:01.323 --> 01:42:04.493 line:83%
You are now exiting "Reflections of the Soul..."

584
01:43:24.072 --> 01:43:27.451 line:83%
You are now exiting "Reflections of the Soul..."

585
01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:41.965 line:83%
Good evening.

586
01:43:43.759 --> 01:43:45.427 line:83%
Is the manager in?

587
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:48.889 line:83%
The manager is always in.

588
01:43:54.019 --> 01:43:55.020 line:83%
Winston.

589
01:43:56.688 --> 01:43:57.814 line:83%
Mr. D'Antonio.

590
01:43:59.024 --> 01:44:00.859 line:83%
Your evening has been colorful, I see.

591
01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.987 line:83%
Seeking safe harbor, I presume?

592
01:44:05.238 --> 01:44:07.616 line:83%
I want his membership revoked. Now.

593
01:44:07.699 --> 01:44:12.037 line:83%
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr. Wick has breached no legalities.

594
01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.247 line:83%
Then you know that I have the right to demand...

595
01:44:14.331 --> 01:44:18.543 line:83%
Nothing. You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.

596
01:44:18.627 --> 01:44:21.380 line:83%
This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

597
01:44:24.383 --> 01:44:26.093 line:83%
All right.

598
01:44:26.176 --> 01:44:29.012 line:83%
Then enjoy your kingdom, Winston, while you still can.

599
01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:32.766 line:83%
And you, its privileges, sir.

600
01:44:45.696 --> 01:44:48.240 line:83%
I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.

601
01:44:52.202 --> 01:44:54.538 line:83%
He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.

602
01:45:46.089 --> 01:45:47.132 line:83%
Duck fat.

603
01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:48.800 line:83%
Makes all the difference.

604
01:45:49.801 --> 01:45:51.261 line:83%
Jonathan...

605
01:45:51.344 --> 01:45:52.471 line:83%
Have you seen the menu here?

606
01:45:54.097 --> 01:45:56.433 line:83%
- Lot of options.
- Jonathan, listen to me...

607
01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:59.978 line:83%
A man can stay here a long time

608
01:46:00.062 --> 01:46:01.730 line:83%
and never eat the same meal twice.

609
01:46:02.731 --> 01:46:06.068 line:83%
Jonathan, just walk away.

610
01:46:08.278 --> 01:46:09.362 line:83%
Yeah, Jonathan.

611
01:46:09.446 --> 01:46:10.947 line:83%
Walk a...

612
01:46:18.997 --> 01:46:20.874 line:83%
What have you done?

613
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.921 line:83%
Finished it.

614
01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:46.191 line:83%
How was he?

615
01:46:46.274 --> 01:46:49.152 line:83%
He was a good dog. I have enjoyed his company.

616
01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:56.201 line:83%
Let's go home.

617
01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:33.924 line:83%
Mr. Wick?

618
01:48:40.388 --> 01:48:42.557 line:83%
If you would be so inclined.

619
01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:17.884 line:83%
Come on, boy.

620
01:49:26.685 --> 01:49:29.062 line:83%
It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.

621
01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:37.404 line:83%
Goodbye.

622
01:50:14.482 --> 01:50:15.984 line:83%
Jonathan.

623
01:50:16.067 --> 01:50:17.235 line:83%
Winston.

624
01:50:18.903 --> 01:50:20.196 line:83%
What am I looking' at?

625
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:24.993 line:83%
The Camorra's doubled Santino's open contract.

626
01:50:25.076 --> 01:50:26.286 line:83%
It's gone international.

627
01:50:27.537 --> 01:50:28.788 line:83%
High Table?

628
01:50:28.872 --> 01:50:29.873 line:83%
Mmm-hmm.

629
01:50:31.499 --> 01:50:32.542 line:83%
And the Continental?

630
01:50:34.502 --> 01:50:36.546 line:83%
You killed a man on company grounds, Jonathan.

631
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:40.425 line:83%
You leave me no choice but
to declare you excommunicado.

632
01:50:42.427 --> 01:50:46.306 line:83%
The doors to any service or provider
in connection with the Continental

633
01:50:46.389 --> 01:50:48.850 line:83%
are now closed to you.

634
01:50:52.228 --> 01:50:54.230 line:83%
I am so sorry.

635
01:50:56.274 --> 01:50:58.276 line:83%
Your life is now forfeit.

636
01:51:00.862 --> 01:51:02.822 line:83%
Then why am I not dead?

637
01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:06.534 line:83%
Because I deemed it not to be.

638
01:51:09.537 --> 01:51:10.538 line:83%
Now.

639
01:51:38.316 --> 01:51:41.528 line:83%
You have one hour. I can't delay it any longer.

640
01:51:43.363 --> 01:51:44.781 line:83%
You might need this...

641
01:51:46.783 --> 01:51:47.784 line:83%
down the road.

642
01:51:52.455 --> 01:51:53.456 line:83%
Winston...

643
01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:56.376 line:83%
tell them.

644
01:51:57.502 --> 01:51:59.504 line:83%
Tell them all.

645
01:51:59.587 --> 01:52:01.589 line:83%
Whoever comes,

646
01:52:01.673 --> 01:52:03.007 line:83%
whoever it is...

647
01:52:04.134 --> 01:52:05.510 line:83%
I'll kill them.

648
01:52:06.511 --> 01:52:08.179 line:83%
I'll kill them all.

649
01:52:12.016 --> 01:52:13.393 line:83%
'Course you will.

650
01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:19.190 line:83%
Jonathan.

651
01:52:21.192 --> 01:52:22.527 line:83%
Winston.

652
01:52:45.383 --> 01:52:46.718 line:83%
Accounts payable.

653
01:52:49.387 --> 01:52:53.391 line:83%
One-one-one-one-one.

654
01:52:55.393 --> 01:52:57.228 line:83%
In one hour.

655
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:59.397 line:83%
John Wick.

656
01:53:01.065 --> 01:53:02.942 line:83%
Excommunicado.

657
01:53:26.674 --> 01:53:30.011 line:83%
Order 11111 confirmed.
