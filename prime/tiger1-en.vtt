00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:47.239 line:82%
The armies of India and Pakistan...

2
00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:49.974 line:82%
...have fought four wars in
the past sixty years...

3
00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:55.682 line:82%
...but there are two government
agencies in these two countries...

4
00:00:55.954 --> 00:00:58.236 line:82%
...that are at war every day,
every moment.

5
00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:01.486 line:82%
India's RAW and Pakistan's ISI.

6
00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:07.111 line:82%
The common man does not get
any news about these agencies...

7
00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:09.361 line:82%
...because in the name
of national security...

8
00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.688 line:82%
...all information is forever guarded.

9
00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:17.185 line:82%
But there are some stories that
escape these walls and office files.

10
00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:22.111 line:82%
This is the story that shook the very
foundations of this secretive world.

11
00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.264 line:82%
This is the story of Tiger.

12
00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:31.853 line:82%
ZAKHO - NORTHERN IRAQ
0530 HRS

13
00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:41.522 line:82%
Goodbye.

14
00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:56.736 line:82%
Tiger?

15
00:04:10.277 --> 00:04:11.819 line:82%
Hello... hello...
Those people are here.

16
00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.936 line:82%
I told you they would find me!

17
00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:16.073 line:82%
They found me!

18
00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:19.361 line:82%
You've kept me here for over a month.
Now get me out of here!

19
00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:21.986 line:82%
Tell me quickly...
what should I do? Tell me.

20
00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:24.504 line:82%
Okay. I'll get there...
you get there too!

21
00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:26.069 line:82%
You're panting like a dog...
how much do you smoke?

22
00:05:26.902 --> 00:05:30.534 line:82%
I can't believe you sold
out to them, Rabinder...

23
00:05:33.393 --> 00:05:34.729 line:82%
How much did the ISI pay?

24
00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:37.426 line:82%
Tiger... how much does
the government job pay us?

25
00:05:40.527 --> 00:05:42.216 line:82%
What is the going price
for buying agents these days?

26
00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:45.620 line:82%
It's a lot, Tiger! Trust me...
there is a lot of money!

27
00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:51.371 line:82%
Should be... after all you
sold information to the ISI...

28
00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.569 line:82%
...the guys who kill our
agents almost every day.

29
00:05:54.902 --> 00:05:56.751 line:82%
So? Even we smash those guys.

30
00:05:56.942 --> 00:05:59.434 line:82%
How many ISI men have you
killed in your career alone?

31
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:05.069 line:82%
This is a game, Tiger...
we are the smallest pawns in it.

32
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:06.848 line:82%
Please understand.

33
00:06:09.444 --> 00:06:11.069 line:82%
I'll show you...

34
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.444 line:82%
Look at this, Tiger!

35
00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:21.430 line:82%
Just see. Will RAW ever give us this?

36
00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:27.902 line:82%
Just see this, Tiger.

37
00:06:28.361 --> 00:06:31.071 line:82%
This is... almost two months' salary.

38
00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.697 line:82%
What good is it, Tiger?

39
00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:36.277 line:82%
One fine day we'll end up dead...
in some obscure part of the world...

40
00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:39.409 line:82%
...and no one will come
to claim our bodies.

41
00:06:39.694 --> 00:06:41.576 line:82%
Come with me, Tiger...
there's a lot of money to be made...

42
00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:43.486 line:82%
...there's nothing
in all these issues.

43
00:06:47.944 --> 00:06:48.973 line:82%
Sorry, Rabinder...

44
00:06:51.763 --> 00:06:52.819 line:82%
...you will have to come with me.

45
00:06:52.988 --> 00:06:53.944 line:82%
I'm not going, Tiger!

46
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:55.944 line:82%
I won't go with you...
I'm telling you, I won't.

47
00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:57.902 line:82%
Alive...

48
00:07:00.236 --> 00:07:00.986 line:82%
...or dead.

49
00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.361 line:82%
He's back!

50
00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:00.402 line:82%
The hero returns...

51
00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:02.443 line:82%
He has shown up after many days.

52
00:13:02.694 --> 00:13:04.814 line:82%
Hey, look... He's back again...

53
00:13:07.569 --> 00:13:09.506 line:82%
Why are you so happy?

54
00:13:09.861 --> 00:13:12.960 line:82%
I'm not happy. I'm just telling you.

55
00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:14.361 line:82%
Look at his face...

56
00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:15.736 line:82%
He must have been in a brawl.

57
00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:17.363 line:82%
He goes missing for months...

58
00:13:17.553 --> 00:13:20.072 line:82%
...how can you even think of getting
him married to our dear Bablee?

59
00:13:23.277 --> 00:13:24.819 line:82%
Why are you staring at him?

60
00:13:25.017 --> 00:13:26.279 line:82%
I'm not staring at him.

61
00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:27.665 line:82%
Do your exercise!

62
00:13:27.861 --> 00:13:28.986 line:82%
But what does he do?

63
00:13:29.194 --> 00:13:30.552 line:82%
How the hell should I know?

64
00:13:30.752 --> 00:13:32.611 line:82%
But he's a Grade 1 officer.

65
00:13:54.091 --> 00:13:57.150 line:82%
Hello, sonny... it's nine already...
let me give you a lift to the office.

66
00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:58.560 line:82%
Thank you, Mr Bagga.

67
00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.444 line:82%
Come...

68
00:13:59.652 --> 00:14:01.824 line:82%
I had a briefing with
Mr Shenoy at nine.

69
00:14:02.194 --> 00:14:04.801 line:82%
Oh, Mr Shenoy is extremely punctual.

70
00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:10.907 line:82%
Sir, Rabinder was kept
near Iraq's Northern border...

71
00:14:11.194 --> 00:14:14.206 line:82%
I had information that the ISI
might move him any time.

72
00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:15.817 line:82%
We caught him at the right time.

73
00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:17.078 line:82%
Good Job, Tiger.

74
00:14:17.611 --> 00:14:18.194 line:82%
Thank you, sir.

75
00:14:18.402 --> 00:14:19.402 line:82%
As usual.

76
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:22.236 line:82%
Submit the full report to Tiwari.

77
00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:23.569 line:82%
Yes, Sir.

78
00:14:26.027 --> 00:14:26.652 line:82%
Tiger.

79
00:14:26.815 --> 00:14:27.480 line:82%
Yes, sir?

80
00:14:27.809 --> 00:14:29.736 line:82%
Your face is badly bruised.

81
00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:31.861 line:82%
Why don't you go on
leave and rest for a bit?

82
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:33.569 line:82%
Sir, I'll be fine in a couple of days.

83
00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:34.861 line:82%
Why do I need to go on leave?

84
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:37.986 line:82%
You've been on assignments
back to back for 12 years now.

85
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:39.831 line:82%
That's way too long.

86
00:14:40.236 --> 00:14:41.861 line:82%
Don't tempt fate.

87
00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:44.069 line:82%
Sir, one fine day I'll find
myself posted to a desk job...

88
00:14:44.402 --> 00:14:46.950 line:82%
...reading files... just like you do.

89
00:14:47.611 --> 00:14:48.821 line:82%
Alright...

90
00:14:49.111 --> 00:14:51.427 line:82%
...as soon as you look normal again...

91
00:14:51.694 --> 00:14:53.069 line:82%
...you can leave for
your next assignment.

92
00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:55.152 line:82%
Where, sir?

93
00:14:55.444 --> 00:14:57.944 line:82%
Why don't you treat me
to your famous daal...

94
00:14:58.736 --> 00:15:02.098 line:82%
...then I'll find you an enemy
in a new country.

95
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.319 line:82%
Done, sir.

96
00:15:06.902 --> 00:15:08.986 line:82%
Sir, I often get this feeling that...

97
00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:13.149 line:82%
...you hired me at RAW purely
for my cooking skills.

98
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:15.963 line:82%
You're right.
For your cooking skills...

99
00:15:16.111 --> 00:15:17.819 line:82%
...and your insanity.

100
00:15:19.194 --> 00:15:21.433 line:82%
How do you live like this, Tiger?

101
00:15:21.694 --> 00:15:23.671 line:82%
This decade old furniture...

102
00:15:23.902 --> 00:15:26.803 line:82%
...no pictures or books or anything?

103
00:15:27.277 --> 00:15:29.369 line:82%
Your salary has been
lying untouched...

104
00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:32.640 line:82%
...in the agency's salary
account for the last 8 years.

105
00:15:33.694 --> 00:15:34.819 line:82%
Why?

106
00:15:35.444 --> 00:15:37.324 line:82%
How can I spend when I'm never here?

107
00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:38.986 line:82%
I have been traveling
all over the world...

108
00:15:39.236 --> 00:15:40.983 line:82%
...for the past 12 years
on government funds.

109
00:15:41.152 --> 00:15:43.777 line:82%
Wow. How much have you saved?

110
00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.944 line:82%
About 2.3 million.

111
00:15:50.944 --> 00:15:53.236 line:82%
But your money will rot
in the agency's bank...

112
00:15:54.652 --> 00:15:58.992 line:82%
No, Sir. The day I retire from
this job. I'll blow it all up.

113
00:16:01.736 --> 00:16:04.962 line:82%
Why didn't you ever have a girlfriend?

114
00:16:05.611 --> 00:16:07.255 line:82%
Sir, how could I have one?

115
00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:10.979 line:82%
Firstly I'm never here and
secondly this goddamn job.

116
00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:13.986 line:82%
What's wrong with the job?

117
00:16:14.486 --> 00:16:18.090 line:82%
Sir, we have no answers
when someone asks.

118
00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:19.319 line:82%
What do you do?

119
00:16:19.527 --> 00:16:20.527 line:82%
I'm in the civil service.

120
00:16:20.736 --> 00:16:21.527 line:82%
What exactly is your job?

121
00:16:21.694 --> 00:16:22.486 line:82%
I'm in administration.

122
00:16:22.652 --> 00:16:23.569 line:82%
What is your duty?

123
00:16:23.777 --> 00:16:24.486 line:82%
Government duty.

124
00:16:24.694 --> 00:16:25.444 line:82%
But what do you do?

125
00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:26.611 line:82%
Nothing as of now.

126
00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:30.319 line:82%
Sir, sometimes I feel like
screaming and saying.

127
00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:31.944 line:82%
I'm a spy. A RAW Agent!!

128
00:16:32.194 --> 00:16:33.319 line:82%
Spy. Secret Agent!!

129
00:16:33.569 --> 00:16:35.081 line:82%
I'm James Bond!!

130
00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:39.861 line:82%
Sir, I still have time.
What about you?

131
00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:42.104 line:82%
Why didn't you ever get married?

132
00:16:42.444 --> 00:16:47.111 line:82%
When I was young...
I was a bit of a poet.

133
00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:53.152 line:82%
...and poets don't settle for arranged
marriages. They look for love.

134
00:16:54.486 --> 00:16:55.861 line:82%
Did you find love, Sir?

135
00:16:57.152 --> 00:16:59.236 line:82%
Yes. I did... once.

136
00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.277 line:82%
Wow!

137
00:17:03.444 --> 00:17:04.611 line:82%
Who was she, Sir?

138
00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:11.236 line:82%
Well, she was this sweet simple girl.

139
00:17:13.402 --> 00:17:20.033 line:82%
When I met her...
I wanted to live my life only for her.

140
00:17:22.402 --> 00:17:23.611 line:82%
And then?

141
00:17:24.694 --> 00:17:29.319 line:82%
Then... my goddamn duty
got in the way.

142
00:17:30.277 --> 00:17:34.944 line:82%
And you chose your duty over love?

143
00:17:35.486 --> 00:17:39.527 line:82%
Of course. Isn't that
what we're trained for?

144
00:17:41.194 --> 00:17:45.032 line:82%
But do you ever regret it, sir?

145
00:17:46.694 --> 00:17:51.264 line:82%
Every day, Tiger. Every single day.

146
00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:01.115 line:82%
Hello... yes, Nambiar.

147
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:06.457 line:82%
Right, right... thank you.

148
00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:11.192 line:82%
It seems we've found
you your next mission.

149
00:18:12.777 --> 00:18:13.861 line:82%
Cheers, sir!

150
00:18:16.236 --> 00:18:17.777 line:82%
Between India and Pakistan...

151
00:18:18.303 --> 00:18:22.276 line:82%
...only India has an
anti-missile system that...

152
00:18:22.652 --> 00:18:27.335 line:82%
...can stop incoming Pakistani
missiles to a large extent.

153
00:18:27.694 --> 00:18:31.527 line:82%
And one man has played
a big role in developing it...

154
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.156 line:82%
Professor Anwar Jamaal Kidwai.

155
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:38.236 line:82%
A scientist who is well known
all over the world...

156
00:18:38.736 --> 00:18:41.861 line:82%
...but he's a maverick... that's why
he quit his government job...

157
00:18:42.232 --> 00:18:45.440 line:82%
...and started teaching at the famous
Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland.

158
00:18:45.777 --> 00:18:49.575 line:82%
But for the last few months
we suspect that Professor Kidwai...

159
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.240 line:82%
...has been sharing his research
findings with other scientists...

160
00:18:54.569 --> 00:18:57.944 line:82%
...who could be working for the
Pakistan defence establishment.

161
00:19:02.527 --> 00:19:04.027 line:82%
So I must stop him?

162
00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:09.607 line:82%
No, Tiger. Like I said,
we only suspect him.

163
00:19:09.902 --> 00:19:12.400 line:82%
All you need to do is observe him.

164
00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.129 line:82%
Tiger...

165
00:19:15.652 --> 00:19:17.694 line:82%
Please don't kill anyone here.

166
00:19:18.111 --> 00:19:18.986 line:82%
Right, sir.

167
00:19:19.611 --> 00:19:23.327 line:82%
Every mission of yours
someone gets killed.

168
00:19:24.402 --> 00:19:26.970 line:82%
Please just observe him. Okay?

169
00:19:27.694 --> 00:19:29.068 line:82%
Okay, sir.

170
00:19:34.269 --> 00:19:35.420 line:82%
Good morning, Professor.

171
00:19:44.986 --> 00:19:47.750 line:82%
Professor Kidwai...
what an honour to meet you.

172
00:19:48.069 --> 00:19:51.845 line:82%
I park there every day. It's my spot.

173
00:19:52.152 --> 00:19:53.387 line:82%
Sure, sir.

174
00:19:59.527 --> 00:20:00.444 line:82%
Professor Kidwai...

175
00:20:01.027 --> 00:20:03.488 line:82%
Professor! Professor Kidwai?

176
00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:05.277 line:82%
No time, no time.

177
00:20:08.777 --> 00:20:10.318 line:82%
Pleasure meeting you.

178
00:20:58.861 --> 00:21:00.687 line:82%
Good afternoon, Professor Kidwai!

179
00:21:00.944 --> 00:21:01.819 line:82%
Hello!

180
00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:04.736 line:82%
Professor, I have to speak with you
about something important.

181
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:06.798 line:82%
Sorry, I've got to feed the dog.

182
00:21:07.088 --> 00:21:09.110 line:82%
After feeding doggy?

183
00:21:09.486 --> 00:21:11.232 line:82%
I won't take too much of your time...

184
00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:13.024 line:82%
Sorry!

185
00:21:14.527 --> 00:21:16.478 line:82%
This professor is a nutcase.

186
00:21:21.486 --> 00:21:23.569 line:82%
Professor... Professor...

187
00:21:23.902 --> 00:21:25.561 line:82%
Professor. I won't take up
too much time.

188
00:21:27.069 --> 00:21:28.902 line:82%
Sorry... got to take Rocket out.

189
00:21:29.402 --> 00:21:31.297 line:82%
Shall I wait here?

190
00:21:31.694 --> 00:21:32.861 line:82%
Rocket!

191
00:21:48.402 --> 00:21:49.444 line:82%
Rocket!

192
00:22:44.833 --> 00:22:45.469 line:82%
Hey!

193
00:22:48.777 --> 00:22:52.927 line:82%
There's one girl who has access
to the professor's house.

194
00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:57.456 line:82%
A British girl of Indian origin. Zoya.

195
00:22:57.944 --> 00:23:01.447 line:82%
A student of Trinity Dance Academy
for a year now.

196
00:23:01.777 --> 00:23:04.361 line:82%
And a part-time caretaker
of his house.

197
00:23:04.581 --> 00:23:06.027 line:82%
Get out! You really cannot be here.

198
00:23:06.236 --> 00:23:08.364 line:82%
Sorry. I'm sorry. Relax.
I really didn't mean to. Excuse.

199
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:09.845 line:82%
Will you please leave!

200
00:23:23.194 --> 00:23:24.097 line:82%
You're still here?

201
00:23:24.267 --> 00:23:26.484 line:82%
Yes... waiting for the mad professor.

202
00:23:27.736 --> 00:23:30.468 line:82%
Next time ring the bell...
or I'll get you arrested.

203
00:23:31.152 --> 00:23:31.795 line:82%
Sorry, Miss.

204
00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:33.350 line:82%
Does he know you?

205
00:23:34.194 --> 00:23:36.076 line:82%
No. I have come from India.

206
00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:39.771 line:82%
It's difficult to say
when he'll be back.

207
00:23:41.894 --> 00:23:43.019 line:82%
This is his house, right?

208
00:23:44.444 --> 00:23:47.309 line:82%
Yes... but he goes for
long walks with Rocket.

209
00:23:49.277 --> 00:23:50.924 line:82%
Hope he hasn't gone to London.

210
00:23:51.194 --> 00:23:53.861 line:82%
I've just come from there.
I could have met him there.

211
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.586 line:82%
I'm sorry... he's troubled me all day.

212
00:24:03.444 --> 00:24:04.299 line:82%
Very funny.

213
00:24:06.986 --> 00:24:10.573 line:82%
Excuse me. I don't know anyone here.

214
00:24:11.027 --> 00:24:12.407 line:82%
Is there a hotel around somewhere?

215
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.378 line:82%
They're on my way. Come on.

216
00:24:18.611 --> 00:24:20.370 line:82%
We've not been introduced as yet.

217
00:24:20.777 --> 00:24:23.518 line:82%
I'm Zoya... Friends call me Zee.

218
00:24:24.569 --> 00:24:28.449 line:82%
I'm Manish Chandra...
My friends call me Doordarshan.

219
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.027 line:82%
What?

220
00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:31.986 line:82%
Zee... Doordarshan?

221
00:24:33.944 --> 00:24:35.938 line:82%
That was a terrible joke.

222
00:24:38.736 --> 00:24:42.553 line:82%
Sorry... it was seriously rotten.

223
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:48.440 line:82%
Check this one.

224
00:24:51.777 --> 00:24:53.111 line:82%
Excuse me... do you have any rooms?

225
00:24:53.486 --> 00:24:54.652 line:82%
Yes I believe we do, sir.

226
00:24:55.194 --> 00:24:56.694 line:82%
Thank you. Looking very lovely today.

227
00:24:56.861 --> 00:24:57.945 line:82%
Thank you.

228
00:25:02.486 --> 00:25:03.319 line:82%
No rooms.

229
00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:08.361 line:82%
Try here.

230
00:25:12.694 --> 00:25:13.777 line:82%
Good evening.

231
00:25:14.152 --> 00:25:15.277 line:82%
Good evening, sir.

232
00:25:16.569 --> 00:25:17.736 line:82%
Can I help you?

233
00:25:18.402 --> 00:25:19.944 line:82%
My name is Manish Chandra.

234
00:25:21.194 --> 00:25:23.163 line:82%
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

235
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:28.986 line:82%
This hotel is over-booked.

236
00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:31.319 line:82%
Okay. Listen my hostel is here...

237
00:25:31.569 --> 00:25:33.874 line:82%
...but there are a couple of hotels
ahead. Try them if you like.

238
00:25:34.361 --> 00:25:36.201 line:82%
Sure. Thank you.

239
00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:32.861 line:82%
Not from there... come this way.

240
00:26:33.055 --> 00:26:33.861 line:82%
Which way?

241
00:26:34.069 --> 00:26:34.899 line:82%
Climb the pipe.

242
00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:37.714 line:82%
This pipe?

243
00:26:52.813 --> 00:26:54.777 line:82%
It's wet... slippery.

244
00:26:56.111 --> 00:26:58.027 line:82%
Wait... I'll get something for you...

245
00:26:58.444 --> 00:26:59.402 line:82%
Okay.

246
00:27:07.027 --> 00:27:08.236 line:82%
Take this.

247
00:27:14.902 --> 00:27:15.944 line:82%
How?

248
00:27:16.736 --> 00:27:17.777 line:82%
I've got a good grip.

249
00:27:17.986 --> 00:27:20.402 line:82%
Okay. Give me 100 Euros.

250
00:27:21.777 --> 00:27:23.111 line:82%
A hundred Euros?

251
00:27:23.902 --> 00:27:25.556 line:82%
What exactly do you do?

252
00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:28.777 line:82%
Do you want to sleep
in that room or not?

253
00:27:29.194 --> 00:27:32.973 line:82%
My friend stays there, but she
is out of town. Hundred Euros?

254
00:27:33.424 --> 00:27:35.861 line:82%
But 100 Euros is a lot...
that's more expensive than hotels.

255
00:27:36.444 --> 00:27:38.736 line:82%
Okay. Then sleep on the bench.

256
00:27:39.986 --> 00:27:43.057 line:82%
Okay, okay. But...

257
00:27:43.902 --> 00:27:46.976 line:82%
Can you take it yourself...
inside the jacket pocket.

258
00:27:51.902 --> 00:27:53.292 line:82%
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

259
00:27:56.402 --> 00:27:57.652 line:82%
What do you do?

260
00:27:58.319 --> 00:27:59.361 line:82%
Me?

261
00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:12.046 line:82%
I'm a writer.

262
00:28:12.444 --> 00:28:14.111 line:82%
What's your business
with the Professor?

263
00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:17.736 line:82%
I'm writing a book on
the finest Indian minds...

264
00:28:18.319 --> 00:28:20.944 line:82%
...and Professor Kidwai
happens to be one of them.

265
00:28:22.091 --> 00:28:23.797 line:82%
So, you're here to interview
the professor?

266
00:28:26.694 --> 00:28:29.861 line:82%
If you interview me later,
that will be a huge help.

267
00:28:30.402 --> 00:28:33.136 line:82%
Yes... why are you
standing on that pipe?

268
00:28:35.527 --> 00:28:37.365 line:82%
Go ahead. Good night.

269
00:28:48.277 --> 00:28:49.361 line:82%
What?

270
00:28:53.694 --> 00:28:54.605 line:82%
Can you cook?

271
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.944 line:82%
Not bad... for an Indian man.

272
00:29:02.944 --> 00:29:04.010 line:82%
Are you married?

273
00:29:04.569 --> 00:29:07.891 line:82%
Straightaway marriage? Won't you
ask me first if I have a girlfriend?

274
00:29:08.282 --> 00:29:12.440 line:82%
No. I think you're old
enough to be married now.

275
00:29:13.246 --> 00:29:16.160 line:82%
No. I'm not married yet.

276
00:29:17.152 --> 00:29:18.194 line:82%
Why?

277
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.026 line:82%
I don't get to meet nice girls.

278
00:29:40.584 --> 00:29:42.122 line:82%
What are you looking for, Mr. Writer?

279
00:29:43.486 --> 00:29:44.569 line:82%
Nothing much...

280
00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:48.641 line:82%
Just a sweet simple girl...

281
00:29:50.611 --> 00:29:57.256 line:82%
Someone who'd make me
want to live only for her.

282
00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:02.576 line:82%
Wow. Very romantic.

283
00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:04.942 line:82%
But you're a bit of a bumpkin
when it comes to style.

284
00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:07.527 line:82%
Really? This is the first time
someone has called me that.

285
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.016 line:82%
What? A bumpkin?

286
00:30:09.902 --> 00:30:11.629 line:82%
No... romantic.

287
00:30:11.902 --> 00:30:13.369 line:82%
And you've been called
a bumpkin before?

288
00:30:14.258 --> 00:30:16.486 line:82%
No... that's a first as well.

289
00:30:18.178 --> 00:30:20.152 line:82%
- Good night Mr Writer.
- Good night, Zoya.

290
00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:23.042 line:82%
The 100 Euros were for
this pass... a play that...

291
00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:25.986 line:82%
I'm going to choreograph...
Professor Kidwai sponsors it.

292
00:30:26.194 --> 00:30:27.791 line:82%
Your breakfast, sir.

293
00:30:29.277 --> 00:30:35.474 line:82%
Excuse me. Can you puncture
the yellow and make it solid?

294
00:30:35.986 --> 00:30:37.404 line:82%
- Okay.
- Thank you.

295
00:30:38.361 --> 00:30:39.402 line:82%
What happened?

296
00:30:39.736 --> 00:30:41.569 line:82%
Aren't you a little fussy
when it comes to food?

297
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:43.057 line:82%
Maybe a little.

298
00:30:45.861 --> 00:30:48.975 line:82%
So you want to spend some
time with Professor Kidwai?

299
00:30:49.527 --> 00:30:52.111 line:82%
Yes... so that I get
to know him better.

300
00:30:52.759 --> 00:30:55.406 line:82%
I'll try to speak to him.

301
00:30:56.402 --> 00:30:58.100 line:82%
Come to his house tomorrow morning.

302
00:30:58.444 --> 00:30:59.444 line:82%
But I can't promise anything.

303
00:31:00.027 --> 00:31:01.159 line:82%
No problem.

304
00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:03.694 line:82%
Just the way you like it, sir.

305
00:31:04.069 --> 00:31:04.861 line:82%
Thank you.

306
00:31:05.319 --> 00:31:06.361 line:82%
And here's the cheque.

307
00:31:06.651 --> 00:31:08.120 line:82%
Whenever you are ready.

308
00:31:08.902 --> 00:31:12.981 line:82%
I hope you don't mind if I leave
you alone with your punctured eggs.

309
00:31:13.194 --> 00:31:15.805 line:82%
I'm getting late for my play
rehearsal. See you later.

310
00:31:19.194 --> 00:31:21.113 line:82%
You pay the bill... why should I?

311
00:31:23.067 --> 00:31:24.148 line:82%
Yes, of course.

312
00:31:24.402 --> 00:31:26.546 line:82%
You keep puncturing eggs
to eat them...

313
00:31:26.986 --> 00:31:29.194 line:82%
...and make the Indian
government pay for it.

314
00:31:30.236 --> 00:31:33.528 line:82%
Manish Chandra...
isn't that a boring name?

315
00:31:34.069 --> 00:31:35.763 line:82%
I wanted a boring name...

316
00:31:36.055 --> 00:31:39.163 line:82%
...should sound like
a decent guy... right?

317
00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.418 line:82%
Look at her gorgeous hair... fire!

318
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:44.652 line:82%
Okay 'decent guy', listen...

319
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:46.944 line:82%
...you'll have to get close
to the professor now.

320
00:31:47.277 --> 00:31:49.630 line:82%
I'm thinking people here
are so honest...

321
00:31:49.918 --> 00:31:51.652 line:82%
...they don't even bolt their doors.

322
00:31:51.986 --> 00:31:53.319 line:82%
I should barge into
the professor's house...

323
00:31:53.527 --> 00:31:54.616 line:82%
...and just run off with his computer.

324
00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.027 line:82%
Oh, no...

325
00:31:56.486 --> 00:31:59.986 line:82%
Shenoy Sir has clearly instructed
we don't need his computer.

326
00:32:00.425 --> 00:32:02.361 line:82%
All we need to do is keep
an eye on what he does.

327
00:32:02.611 --> 00:32:04.402 line:82%
Who he meets... who he speaks to.

328
00:32:04.819 --> 00:32:06.670 line:82%
The Professor is a nutcase...

329
00:32:07.027 --> 00:32:09.629 line:82%
I'm thinking of entering his
house with the girl's help...

330
00:32:09.905 --> 00:32:11.567 line:82%
...she's calling me tomorrow morning.

331
00:32:11.902 --> 00:32:12.527 line:82%
Good plan.

332
00:32:17.944 --> 00:32:18.980 line:82%
Is he there?

333
00:32:19.236 --> 00:32:19.901 line:82%
Maybe.

334
00:32:21.115 --> 00:32:23.885 line:82%
Sir, I'm writing a book on
the finest Indian minds.

335
00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:27.275 line:82%
I'm just a mad scientist...

336
00:32:27.736 --> 00:32:29.652 line:82%
...at least this is what the
Indian Government thinks.

337
00:32:29.902 --> 00:32:31.968 line:82%
No, sir. You are being modest.

338
00:32:32.372 --> 00:32:34.907 line:82%
Okay... if you insist.

339
00:32:35.277 --> 00:32:36.944 line:82%
Tell me what will I have to do?

340
00:32:37.503 --> 00:32:41.092 line:82%
Sir, I want to spend the maximum
time possible with you.

341
00:32:41.344 --> 00:32:43.470 line:82%
It will be good for the book.

342
00:32:43.762 --> 00:32:46.393 line:82%
For example, when you
make your morning notes...

343
00:32:46.794 --> 00:32:51.319 line:82%
...then I can be with you
when you leave for college.

344
00:32:51.694 --> 00:32:54.236 line:82%
I can be with you in your
office observing your work...

345
00:32:54.444 --> 00:32:55.486 line:82%
...seeing your research.

346
00:32:55.944 --> 00:33:00.402 line:82%
We can talk in your house
when you come back home.

347
00:33:00.902 --> 00:33:05.861 line:82%
Just observe you and be around you,
sir. Like a constant companion.

348
00:33:07.777 --> 00:33:15.586 line:82%
Mr Chandra, are you here to write
a book on me or to marry me?

349
00:33:21.444 --> 00:33:24.819 line:82%
Zoya, why does this damn Rocket
launch himself when he sees me?

350
00:33:25.027 --> 00:33:27.861 line:82%
Hey... don't say that...
Rocket is very sweet.

351
00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:29.704 line:82%
But he keeps barking at me.

352
00:33:29.992 --> 00:33:31.819 line:82%
That's because you swore at him.

353
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.095 line:82%
Hey... but I said it in front of you.

354
00:33:34.652 --> 00:33:36.069 line:82%
Don't you like dogs?

355
00:33:43.944 --> 00:33:46.969 line:82%
No. I do like them.

356
00:33:47.819 --> 00:33:48.694 line:82%
Good.

357
00:33:49.944 --> 00:33:52.242 line:82%
Zoya... your hostel.

358
00:33:53.069 --> 00:33:54.736 line:82%
Yes... bye.

359
00:33:55.085 --> 00:33:58.893 line:82%
Zoya... do you want to...

360
00:33:59.902 --> 00:34:01.277 line:82%
...like have dinner?

361
00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:05.277 line:82%
Mr. Writer, are you asking me
out on a date?

362
00:34:05.616 --> 00:34:06.652 line:82%
Date?

363
00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:09.544 line:82%
No. I mean... we can have a meal.

364
00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:15.907 line:82%
I'm going out with my friends tonight.

365
00:34:16.194 --> 00:34:18.111 line:82%
Join us. I'll let you pay the bill.

366
00:34:18.694 --> 00:34:19.569 line:82%
Sure.

367
00:34:22.736 --> 00:34:24.444 line:82%
But I hope you won't
turn up like this?

368
00:34:26.611 --> 00:34:27.527 line:82%
Like what?

369
00:34:28.986 --> 00:34:31.652 line:82%
You know... dressed like a bumpkin.

370
00:34:33.592 --> 00:34:34.861 line:82%
Just get a little cooler...

371
00:34:38.111 --> 00:34:39.902 line:82%
Keep your foot behind that line.

372
00:34:50.652 --> 00:34:51.319 line:82%
Hey, everybody!!

373
00:34:51.569 --> 00:34:54.444 line:82%
Guys listen. This is my friend
Manish. He's from India.

374
00:34:54.777 --> 00:34:56.680 line:82%
Hey Manish, it's your turn.

375
00:34:58.611 --> 00:35:01.200 line:82%
Have you ever thrown darts?

376
00:35:15.152 --> 00:35:16.111 line:82%
Hello...

377
00:35:16.944 --> 00:35:19.236 line:82%
Dude... all three hit bull's-eye!

378
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:21.194 line:82%
Are you a writer or James Bond?

379
00:35:21.402 --> 00:35:22.877 line:82%
I know... I know. Won't happen again.

380
00:35:23.111 --> 00:35:25.319 line:82%
This girl is affecting you, my friend.

381
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:28.319 line:82%
Don't be silly.
It's a part of my job.

382
00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:31.438 line:82%
Fine... and don't drink too much.

383
00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:35.486 line:82%
Okay... mummy dear... bye.

384
00:35:36.027 --> 00:35:38.444 line:82%
Oh, so sweet...
was that your mother on the line?

385
00:35:43.569 --> 00:35:45.861 line:82%
Come on, guys...
we're going to Mike's party.

386
00:35:47.444 --> 00:35:48.569 line:82%
- Do you wanna come?
- No, no.

387
00:35:48.777 --> 00:35:49.944 line:82%
Come on, ya... it will be fun.

388
00:35:50.194 --> 00:35:52.111 line:82%
No. You enjoy. You go.

389
00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:55.236 line:82%
You guys carry on.
I'll see you later.

390
00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:56.986 line:82%
Okay, bye! Cheers!

391
00:35:57.277 --> 00:35:57.861 line:82%
Bye!

392
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:59.402 line:82%
Hey, but please don't stay
because of me.

393
00:35:59.944 --> 00:36:02.684 line:82%
Why? Now you don't
want to pay for my dinner?

394
00:36:07.152 --> 00:36:08.819 line:82%
No, not Ree... Dee...

395
00:36:09.402 --> 00:36:10.277 line:82%
Ta-ng-dee

396
00:36:10.736 --> 00:36:11.569 line:82%
Tang-Ree

397
00:36:11.986 --> 00:36:13.361 line:82%
Tang... Tang-dee...

398
00:36:13.736 --> 00:36:15.486 line:82%
That's what I said... Tang-ree

399
00:36:15.694 --> 00:36:17.611 line:82%
Do as I say.
Bend your tongue upwards...

400
00:36:17.861 --> 00:36:21.142 line:82%
...and touch it to the roof of
your mouth. Like this...

401
00:36:22.694 --> 00:36:28.527 line:82%
...and now hit your front two
Bugs Bunny teeth with it... Dee!

402
00:36:28.777 --> 00:36:29.652 line:82%
Ree...

403
00:36:30.986 --> 00:36:31.569 line:82%
Dee...

404
00:36:31.777 --> 00:36:32.694 line:82%
- Tang-dee...
- Correct!

405
00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:33.527 line:82%
See... right?

406
00:36:33.694 --> 00:36:34.444 line:82%
Now place the order.

407
00:36:34.703 --> 00:36:35.428 line:82%
Okay.

408
00:36:35.604 --> 00:36:36.445 line:82%
- Yes ma'am.
- Hi.

409
00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:38.078 line:82%
Two... Tang-ree kebabs.

410
00:36:38.486 --> 00:36:40.921 line:82%
Go ahead, my friend.
Get Tang-ree kebabs.

411
00:36:41.193 --> 00:36:42.034 line:82%
No problem, Sir.

412
00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:45.301 line:82%
You know what?

413
00:36:46.627 --> 00:36:47.944 line:82%
You don't look like a writer.

414
00:36:53.111 --> 00:36:54.069 line:82%
For example...

415
00:36:54.444 --> 00:36:56.926 line:82%
...your hands...
they are not like a writer's...

416
00:36:57.277 --> 00:36:59.986 line:82%
...they're cut and bruised
like a wrestler's.

417
00:37:00.986 --> 00:37:02.811 line:82%
Why did you become a writer?

418
00:37:04.819 --> 00:37:07.569 line:82%
Just followed my heart.

419
00:37:08.236 --> 00:37:12.152 line:82%
Very few people follow
their hearts. You're lucky.

420
00:37:14.819 --> 00:37:17.944 line:82%
The most important
thing for an agent is...

421
00:37:18.277 --> 00:37:21.826 line:82%
...that he should use his
head and not his heart.

422
00:37:22.126 --> 00:37:27.317 line:82%
The day you follow your heart,
consider yourself dead.

423
00:37:29.902 --> 00:37:31.611 line:82%
I admire a man who follows his heart.

424
00:37:35.111 --> 00:37:36.277 line:82%
Tang-dee kabab for you, sir...

425
00:37:37.652 --> 00:37:40.364 line:82%
...and ma'am... for you Tang-ree.
Enjoy.

426
00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:44.601 line:82%
What the hell,
Gopi you kept coughing.

427
00:37:44.861 --> 00:37:47.884 line:82%
What if she saw you.
I've reached. I'll call you back.

428
00:38:06.694 --> 00:38:08.383 line:82%
But Tiger, he could have been
a burglar.

429
00:38:08.652 --> 00:38:09.896 line:82%
No, Gopi.

430
00:38:10.402 --> 00:38:14.361 line:82%
The way he attacked me...
he was obviously trained.

431
00:38:14.944 --> 00:38:18.570 line:82%
Someone is reacting on seeing me
with the Professor.

432
00:38:18.944 --> 00:38:20.277 line:82%
Boss, things are not good here.

433
00:38:20.527 --> 00:38:21.736 line:82%
We'll have to wrap this up quickly.

434
00:38:22.027 --> 00:38:23.669 line:82%
That's why we're here.

435
00:38:29.111 --> 00:38:30.402 line:82%
How's this?

436
00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:32.789 line:82%
What will you do with it?

437
00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:34.111 line:82%
It's a gift.

438
00:38:34.486 --> 00:38:35.527 line:82%
And it's a gift for whom?

439
00:38:35.944 --> 00:38:38.111 line:82%
For Zoya... to say thank you.

440
00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:40.542 line:82%
Wow, Tiger!

441
00:38:40.944 --> 00:38:43.065 line:82%
You've used people all over
the world and discarded them...

442
00:38:43.277 --> 00:38:44.986 line:82%
...since when have you
started saying thank you?

443
00:38:45.402 --> 00:38:47.055 line:82%
Gopi... this is a different
sort of a mission...

444
00:38:47.319 --> 00:38:48.652 line:82%
...here it's important
to say thank you.

445
00:38:48.944 --> 00:38:49.917 line:82%
Which mission?

446
00:38:50.125 --> 00:38:51.861 line:82%
Ours? Or have you started
another mission?

447
00:38:52.111 --> 00:38:54.304 line:82%
Stop your nonsense and tell me
what you think of this.

448
00:38:56.444 --> 00:38:57.444 line:82%
Isn't this too personal?

449
00:38:58.777 --> 00:38:59.319 line:82%
What?

450
00:38:59.527 --> 00:39:01.314 line:82%
I mean... do you know her that
well that you can give her a dress?

451
00:39:01.819 --> 00:39:03.152 line:82%
I'm giving her a dress...
not taking it off.

452
00:39:15.277 --> 00:39:19.326 line:82%
Tiger, you've never bought a gift for
a girl ever in your life... have you?

453
00:39:19.694 --> 00:39:20.569 line:82%
Never.

454
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:21.777 line:82%
Then what's going on here?

455
00:39:22.611 --> 00:39:23.444 line:82%
What?

456
00:39:23.819 --> 00:39:27.565 line:82%
Hey... it's extremely important
to woo Zoya for this mission.

457
00:39:28.694 --> 00:39:29.792 line:82%
What?

458
00:39:30.173 --> 00:39:32.643 line:82%
Don't get wooed yourself
in the process.

459
00:39:39.736 --> 00:39:40.569 line:82%
Hi, Zoya.

460
00:39:42.027 --> 00:39:42.971 line:82%
Hi.

461
00:39:43.652 --> 00:39:45.125 line:82%
Hope you're not busy?

462
00:39:45.694 --> 00:39:48.083 line:82%
Lighting design for the show.

463
00:39:51.027 --> 00:39:52.319 line:82%
Is that gift for me?

464
00:39:52.777 --> 00:39:53.527 line:82%
Yes.

465
00:39:54.402 --> 00:39:57.374 line:82%
Really? Is it really for me?

466
00:39:57.694 --> 00:40:01.127 line:82%
Yes. But honestly... this is the
first time I've given a gift to a girl.

467
00:40:01.463 --> 00:40:05.215 line:82%
In these matters I'm a bit of a...
like you say... bumpkin.

468
00:40:07.819 --> 00:40:10.037 line:82%
That's really sweet of you...
can I open it now?

469
00:40:10.214 --> 00:40:11.111 line:82%
Yes.

470
00:40:20.486 --> 00:40:22.075 line:82%
How do you know that...

471
00:40:23.736 --> 00:40:27.861 line:82%
Your room had so many things
with stars and stuff?

472
00:40:32.611 --> 00:40:34.135 line:82%
You don't like it?

473
00:40:35.402 --> 00:40:38.069 line:82%
No, Manish... I really like it.

474
00:40:38.777 --> 00:40:41.972 line:82%
Then why are you crying?

475
00:40:43.777 --> 00:40:45.806 line:82%
It reminds me of someone...

476
00:40:52.611 --> 00:40:55.547 line:82%
Hey, Zoya, do you want to
give me the spotlight cue?

477
00:40:56.152 --> 00:40:57.736 line:82%
Yes, sure... just give me one second.

478
00:41:02.224 --> 00:41:04.837 line:82%
Okay, switch on track number 9.
I'll show you the path.

479
00:41:08.361 --> 00:41:09.557 line:82%
One second.

480
00:41:10.486 --> 00:41:13.527 line:82%
Will you help me? I can't do it alone.

481
00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:15.569 line:82%
But I don't know how to dance.

482
00:41:16.736 --> 00:41:18.964 line:82%
No one is asking you to dance.

483
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.266 line:82%
Just hold me and follow me.

484
00:41:23.944 --> 00:41:25.555 line:82%
Oh... come on.

485
00:42:16.986 --> 00:42:17.861 line:82%
Manish.

486
00:42:20.944 --> 00:42:22.111 line:82%
Music is over.

487
00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:27.736 line:82%
What happened?

488
00:42:29.078 --> 00:42:30.130 line:82%
My head is spinning.

489
00:42:56.277 --> 00:42:58.069 line:82%
Wanderer... Wanderer.

490
00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:01.902 line:82%
My heart's a wanderer.

491
00:43:04.277 --> 00:43:05.819 line:82%
From the moment I saw her.

492
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:07.777 line:82%
My heart became a wanderer.

493
00:43:08.236 --> 00:43:09.777 line:82%
Neither awake nor asleep.

494
00:43:10.027 --> 00:43:11.694 line:82%
My heart's a wanderer.

495
00:43:12.277 --> 00:43:13.694 line:82%
When she smiles.

496
00:43:14.194 --> 00:43:15.777 line:82%
I forget everything.

497
00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:19.569 line:82%
See... My heart has gone wayward.

498
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:23.402 line:82%
Wanderer... Wanderer.

499
00:43:24.027 --> 00:43:25.694 line:82%
For her melodies.

500
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:27.736 line:82%
My heart became a wanderer.

501
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:39.444 line:82%
Wanderer... Wanderer.

502
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:41.777 line:82%
For her melodies.

503
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:43.944 line:82%
My heart became a wanderer.

504
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:31.486 line:82%
She breezes gently past my heart.

505
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:39.444 line:82%
Her words are a mystery to me.

506
00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:45.194 line:82%
When she laughs...
colourful butterflies take flight.

507
00:44:45.569 --> 00:44:49.236 line:82%
It's like being struck by lightning.

508
00:44:50.319 --> 00:44:53.527 line:82%
I have surrendered my heart.

509
00:44:54.027 --> 00:44:57.402 line:82%
Wanderer... Wanderer.

510
00:44:58.027 --> 00:44:59.777 line:82%
For her melodies.

511
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:01.902 line:82%
My heart became a wanderer.

512
00:45:10.027 --> 00:45:13.527 line:82%
Her words cast a magical spell.

513
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:21.319 line:82%
Her words cast a magical spell.

514
00:45:21.777 --> 00:45:25.402 line:82%
Her eyes are an artist's delight.

515
00:45:27.444 --> 00:45:31.236 line:82%
I've dreamt a hundred dreams
about her.

516
00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:35.319 line:82%
And still I'm restless to see her.

517
00:45:36.277 --> 00:45:39.611 line:82%
I would give up the world for her.

518
00:45:40.027 --> 00:45:43.319 line:82%
Wanderer... Wanderer.

519
00:45:43.986 --> 00:45:45.819 line:82%
For her melodies.

520
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:47.736 line:82%
My heart became a wanderer.

521
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:51.236 line:82%
Wanderer... Wanderer.

522
00:45:52.027 --> 00:45:53.777 line:82%
For her melodies.

523
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:55.694 line:82%
My heart became a wanderer.

524
00:46:05.819 --> 00:46:06.611 line:82%
What are you doing?

525
00:46:07.152 --> 00:46:08.322 line:82%
What am I doing?

526
00:46:10.027 --> 00:46:11.096 line:82%
Were you just dancing?

527
00:46:12.027 --> 00:46:12.869 line:82%
Dancing?

528
00:46:18.277 --> 00:46:20.027 line:82%
Are you crazy? Who was dancing?

529
00:46:21.236 --> 00:46:23.444 line:82%
Forget the girl...
get Rocket. Let's go.

530
00:46:24.527 --> 00:46:27.236 line:82%
One damned dog has made
a kitten out of Tiger.

531
00:46:27.861 --> 00:46:29.121 line:82%
Bloody mouse!

532
00:46:44.402 --> 00:46:45.819 line:82%
Zoya... will you come
out with me tonight?

533
00:46:45.986 --> 00:46:46.736 line:82%
Why are you running?

534
00:46:46.944 --> 00:46:48.319 line:82%
Because you're on a cycle.

535
00:46:51.027 --> 00:46:51.944 line:82%
What happened?

536
00:46:53.402 --> 00:46:54.402 line:82%
Can we meet tonight?

537
00:46:54.902 --> 00:46:55.694 line:82%
Tonight?

538
00:46:56.111 --> 00:46:58.361 line:82%
Tonight... tonight is very important.

539
00:46:59.069 --> 00:47:02.359 line:82%
Mr. Writer... so you are asking me
out on a date?

540
00:47:03.861 --> 00:47:04.902 line:82%
Yes, Zoya Zee.

541
00:47:07.486 --> 00:47:08.317 line:82%
When and where?

542
00:47:08.861 --> 00:47:10.736 line:82%
Central Park... at 11 sharp.

543
00:47:11.319 --> 00:47:12.198 line:82%
At 11?

544
00:47:12.569 --> 00:47:16.176 line:82%
11 p.m. is very important.

545
00:47:20.486 --> 00:47:21.623 line:82%
Okay.

546
00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:27.402 line:82%
Rocket?

547
00:47:30.361 --> 00:47:31.277 line:82%
Hey!

548
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:34.527 line:82%
Don't misbehave with elders!

549
00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.152 line:82%
Hey... if you bite me
your teeth will break.

550
00:47:39.277 --> 00:47:40.724 line:82%
Good boy, Rocket.

551
00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:46.402 line:82%
Good boy, Rocket. Good boy.

552
00:47:47.027 --> 00:47:48.194 line:82%
Good boy, Rocket.

553
00:47:51.902 --> 00:47:52.777 line:82%
Hi...

554
00:47:53.194 --> 00:47:55.569 line:82%
Have you got Professor Kidwai
for the date as well?

555
00:47:57.277 --> 00:47:59.736 line:82%
I told you I'd get you to be
friends with Rocket... see.

556
00:48:00.111 --> 00:48:02.553 line:82%
It's done. Now he'll never bark
at you.

557
00:48:03.409 --> 00:48:05.527 line:82%
Zoya Zee. Come, I want to
show you something.

558
00:48:05.902 --> 00:48:06.861 line:82%
Come Rocket, come, come.

559
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.986 line:82%
What?

560
00:48:13.486 --> 00:48:17.277 line:82%
How sweet. So you called me here
to see this?

561
00:48:47.444 --> 00:48:51.111 line:82%
Such a meteor shower happens
only once in 20-25 years.

562
00:48:54.236 --> 00:48:56.924 line:82%
Do you know when the
last such shower was?

563
00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:01.573 line:82%
16th June 1991...

564
00:49:02.361 --> 00:49:04.188 line:82%
...at 11:55.

565
00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.687 line:82%
I was 6 years old.

566
00:49:09.986 --> 00:49:13.167 line:82%
My father had an old Willy's jeep.

567
00:49:14.277 --> 00:49:16.944 line:82%
We would drive out of the city...

568
00:49:18.485 --> 00:49:19.918 line:82%
...to see stars.

569
00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:25.111 line:82%
He would tell me that
watching stars...

570
00:49:25.402 --> 00:49:27.194 line:82%
...makes people happy.

571
00:49:29.152 --> 00:49:33.958 line:82%
Because all your loved ones
eventually become stars in the sky...

572
00:49:35.486 --> 00:49:38.237 line:82%
...and bless us from up there.

573
00:49:39.111 --> 00:49:43.187 line:82%
As a child I used to enjoy
hearing such stories.

574
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:47.569 line:82%
Zee, where is your father?

575
00:50:03.111 --> 00:50:04.755 line:82%
Which one?

576
00:50:12.486 --> 00:50:14.111 line:82%
That one.

577
00:50:14.736 --> 00:50:18.384 line:82%
Wow... right next to my father.

578
00:50:23.694 --> 00:50:25.772 line:82%
What was your father's name?

579
00:50:27.444 --> 00:50:28.824 line:82%
Nazar Jung.

580
00:50:35.694 --> 00:50:36.877 line:82%
Nazar, sir...

581
00:50:37.111 --> 00:50:38.300 line:82%
What shall I hide from you...

582
00:50:39.027 --> 00:50:40.759 line:82%
...you are seeing everything
from there...

583
00:50:41.111 --> 00:50:42.529 line:82%
...after all, your name means sight.

584
00:50:43.027 --> 00:50:46.188 line:82%
Honestly... I'm a little slow
in certain matters.

585
00:50:46.486 --> 00:50:50.028 line:82%
I think that's why your daughter
calls me a bumpkin.

586
00:50:50.694 --> 00:50:52.777 line:82%
Honestly... I want to convey
something to your daughter...

587
00:50:53.319 --> 00:50:56.438 line:82%
...but I don't know how to...

588
00:50:57.277 --> 00:51:01.739 line:82%
So, Mr Nazar, what should
I do according to you... any tips?

589
00:51:02.194 --> 00:51:03.245 line:82%
Manish.

590
00:51:06.152 --> 00:51:07.662 line:82%
What do you want to tell me?

591
00:52:04.236 --> 00:52:05.571 line:82%
Hey, caveman.

592
00:52:08.152 --> 00:52:10.044 line:82%
- Is everything alright?
- I need a drink.

593
00:52:15.152 --> 00:52:16.236 line:82%
What the hell are you saying?

594
00:52:16.986 --> 00:52:18.319 line:82%
Can't people like us fall in love?

595
00:52:19.652 --> 00:52:20.905 line:82%
Of course we can...
but not on a mission.

596
00:52:22.444 --> 00:52:23.993 line:82%
When are we not on a mission?

597
00:52:24.236 --> 00:52:26.277 line:82%
And do we have a life
beyond these missions or not?

598
00:52:27.986 --> 00:52:29.249 line:82%
Mission!

599
00:52:32.194 --> 00:52:33.917 line:82%
Is Zoya also?

600
00:52:34.944 --> 00:52:37.245 line:82%
Zoya likes that writer
Manish Chandra.

601
00:52:37.569 --> 00:52:39.898 line:82%
I am neither Manish
nor am I a writer.

602
00:52:40.236 --> 00:52:41.721 line:82%
Who am I?

603
00:52:42.152 --> 00:52:44.238 line:82%
I've changed so many names...

604
00:52:44.819 --> 00:52:47.070 line:82%
...that I don't even remember
what my parents named me.

605
00:52:47.611 --> 00:52:49.318 line:82%
What are you saying, Tiger?

606
00:52:49.861 --> 00:52:51.277 line:82%
Tiger... Tiger... Tiger.

607
00:52:51.819 --> 00:52:53.772 line:82%
Shenoy sir called me that once...

608
00:52:54.194 --> 00:52:55.824 line:82%
...and now everyone calls me that.

609
00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:58.041 line:82%
Tiger is a name meant for dogs.

610
00:52:59.333 --> 00:53:02.152 line:82%
I warned you...
in an attempt to woo her...

611
00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:05.230 line:82%
...don't get wooed yourself
in the process.

612
00:53:06.944 --> 00:53:08.458 line:82%
Say thank you now.

613
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:16.536 line:82%
Should I tell you something.

614
00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.034 line:82%
You've chosen a nice
girl (sister-in-law).

615
00:53:25.486 --> 00:53:27.741 line:82%
It's five in the morning.
Get some sleep.

616
00:53:28.361 --> 00:53:30.118 line:82%
It's her play in the evening.

617
00:53:46.736 --> 00:53:47.694 line:82%
Sorry.

618
00:53:49.902 --> 00:53:51.071 line:82%
Sorry.

619
00:54:01.152 --> 00:54:02.135 line:82%
Excuse me?

620
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.540 line:82%
Shit!

621
00:57:46.111 --> 00:57:47.319 line:82%
Come on... come on.

622
00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:05.686 line:82%
In ten minutes you've
destroyed half of Dublin...

623
00:59:05.885 --> 00:59:07.624 line:82%
...and that agent got away too...
what the hell are you doing, Tiger?

624
00:59:07.822 --> 00:59:09.484 line:82%
What else could I have done
in that situation?

625
00:59:09.736 --> 00:59:10.981 line:82%
And that guy would have come
to know that I'm not a writer.

626
00:59:11.234 --> 00:59:14.231 line:82%
Not just him... the whole town
will know you're not a writer.

627
00:59:15.777 --> 00:59:16.819 line:82%
Where will the Professor be right now?

628
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:18.747 line:82%
Must be watching the play...
what else?

629
00:59:18.986 --> 00:59:21.070 line:82%
Do one thing... you go there. You'll
stay safe from the police as well.

630
00:59:21.286 --> 00:59:23.649 line:82%
I'll speak to Shenoy sir
on a secure line and then call you.

631
00:59:23.846 --> 00:59:25.672 line:82%
- Alright.
- Keep your phone on.

632
00:59:25.986 --> 00:59:28.218 line:82%
And listen... get your face fixed.

633
00:59:28.402 --> 00:59:29.277 line:82%
Yes... I'll do that.

634
00:59:29.486 --> 00:59:31.934 line:82%
And listen... keep this.

635
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:36.843 line:82%
Anything else?

636
00:59:37.277 --> 00:59:38.986 line:82%
Not at all...
after destroying everything.

637
00:59:39.236 --> 00:59:41.972 line:82%
You please go ahead and enjoy
the play with dear sister-in-law.

638
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.986 line:82%
Yes, Gopi?

639
01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.799 line:82%
Tiger... there's some activity
at the Professor's house.

640
01:00:58.027 --> 01:00:59.527 line:82%
But the Professor is here.

641
01:00:59.861 --> 01:01:01.277 line:82%
That's what I'm saying.
You head there.

642
01:01:01.444 --> 01:01:02.330 line:82%
There seems to be
some trouble.

643
01:01:02.494 --> 01:01:03.527 line:82%
Oh, shit!

644
01:01:51.736 --> 01:01:53.629 line:82%
Put your hands behind your head.

645
01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.863 line:82%
Turn around.

646
01:01:56.486 --> 01:01:57.611 line:82%
Slowly.

647
01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:03.944 line:82%
Zoya.

648
01:02:10.361 --> 01:02:12.231 line:82%
But you were at the play?

649
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:23.527 line:82%
What business do you
have with the Professor?

650
01:02:23.736 --> 01:02:24.986 line:82%
So, you're here to
interview the Professor?

651
01:02:25.204 --> 01:02:26.069 line:82%
What do you do?

652
01:02:26.361 --> 01:02:27.527 line:82%
You don't look like a writer.

653
01:02:28.736 --> 01:02:29.611 line:82%
Oh my God!

654
01:02:30.569 --> 01:02:33.569 line:82%
So you want to spend some
time with Professor Kidwai?

655
01:02:36.111 --> 01:02:37.069 line:82%
Agent...

656
01:02:39.111 --> 01:02:40.111 line:82%
ISI... right?

657
01:02:48.277 --> 01:02:49.194 line:82%
Get up...

658
01:03:11.986 --> 01:03:12.902 line:82%
Sit down.

659
01:03:27.027 --> 01:03:28.656 line:82%
You're an agent...

660
01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:34.111 line:82%
...and clearly a very good
one at that.

661
01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:40.989 line:82%
So you must be aware...

662
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:45.188 line:82%
...of what we do in such situations.

663
01:03:47.652 --> 01:03:49.277 line:82%
Still... I'll tell you.

664
01:03:54.194 --> 01:03:55.777 line:82%
You have two options.

665
01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:02.051 line:82%
Either you work with us...

666
01:04:03.777 --> 01:04:05.652 line:82%
...and give us all the information.

667
01:04:10.027 --> 01:04:11.027 line:82%
Or...

668
01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:18.718 line:82%
I'll have to... right here...

669
01:04:20.402 --> 01:04:23.777 line:82%
I will not betray my country.

670
01:04:27.652 --> 01:04:29.619 line:82%
So that leaves me
with just one choice...

671
01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:35.130 line:82%
...and for you too.

672
01:05:15.944 --> 01:05:17.402 line:82%
My name is not Manish...

673
01:05:19.027 --> 01:05:20.861 line:82%
...and I'm not a writer...

674
01:05:23.194 --> 01:05:25.241 line:82%
...besides these two things...

675
01:05:26.402 --> 01:05:28.194 line:82%
...everything I told you was true.

676
01:05:31.486 --> 01:05:34.261 line:82%
All I want to know from you is...

677
01:05:37.444 --> 01:05:39.444 line:82%
...what I saw in your eyes...

678
01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:44.236 line:82%
...was that a lie too?

679
01:05:50.819 --> 01:05:53.486 line:82%
I was just doing my job...

680
01:05:59.319 --> 01:06:01.063 line:82%
...and nothing else.

681
01:06:41.143 --> 01:06:44.652 line:82%
Tiger... you end up killing
someone on every assignment.

682
01:06:45.319 --> 01:06:47.652 line:82%
We didn't want this
on this assignment.

683
01:06:47.986 --> 01:06:50.064 line:82%
Sir, the situation
was really bad there...

684
01:06:50.334 --> 01:06:52.451 line:82%
...it was either me or their agent.

685
01:06:52.819 --> 01:06:55.183 line:82%
Police found their agent's body.

686
01:06:55.486 --> 01:06:57.486 line:82%
I hope you haven't left any trails?

687
01:06:57.819 --> 01:07:00.458 line:82%
No, sir... and I retrieved
the hard disk as well.

688
01:07:00.819 --> 01:07:01.985 line:82%
I've submitted it to Joshi.

689
01:07:02.569 --> 01:07:03.861 line:82%
File your report as well.

690
01:07:08.902 --> 01:07:09.998 line:82%
Tiger.

691
01:07:12.152 --> 01:07:13.944 line:82%
Are you ready for
your next assignment?

692
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:18.527 line:82%
Sir... I'm slightly tired
of field operations.

693
01:07:18.861 --> 01:07:20.501 line:82%
If you deem it fit...

694
01:07:21.152 --> 01:07:23.091 line:82%
...you can assign me to a desk job
for a few days.

695
01:07:32.777 --> 01:07:34.861 line:82%
I'm Zoya... friends call me Zee.

696
01:07:35.111 --> 01:07:36.755 line:82%
I'm Manish Chandra.

697
01:07:37.111 --> 01:07:38.611 line:82%
My friends call me Doordarshan.

698
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:44.307 line:82%
Touch it to the roof of
your mouth and hit it... Dee!

699
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:45.448 line:82%
Ree!

700
01:07:46.652 --> 01:07:47.277 line:82%
Dee.

701
01:07:47.527 --> 01:07:48.361 line:82%
- Tang-dee...
- Correct?

702
01:07:48.569 --> 01:07:49.027 line:82%
Right?

703
01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:50.451 line:82%
Now place the order.

704
01:07:56.611 --> 01:07:59.114 line:82%
Very few people have the
courage to follow their heart.

705
01:07:59.819 --> 01:08:01.283 line:82%
You are lucky.

706
01:08:19.402 --> 01:08:20.777 line:82%
Hey, sonny!

707
01:08:21.527 --> 01:08:22.569 line:82%
Yes, Mr. Bagga?

708
01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:24.944 line:82%
Working hard? Where are
you planning to go now?

709
01:08:25.194 --> 01:08:26.569 line:82%
Nowhere, Mr. Bagga...
Nothing is happening.

710
01:08:26.777 --> 01:08:28.402 line:82%
Come... let me drop you home then.

711
01:08:28.652 --> 01:08:29.444 line:82%
- Sure, let's go.
- Come.

712
01:08:29.652 --> 01:08:30.652 line:82%
You know, sonny...

713
01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:33.513 line:82%
...the UN Foreign Ministers' meeting
is about to take place in Istanbul.

714
01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:35.527 line:82%
And we've intercepted
a message that...

715
01:08:35.777 --> 01:08:38.948 line:82%
...the Pakistani delegates are likely
to raise the Kashmir issue again.

716
01:08:39.152 --> 01:08:40.507 line:82%
Ever since then...

717
01:08:40.777 --> 01:08:44.797 line:82%
Mr. Shenoy has asked me to monitor
every known Pakistani source.

718
01:08:45.027 --> 01:08:50.784 line:82%
And for the past 20 days these random
messages have messed up my mind.

719
01:08:51.486 --> 01:08:54.828 line:82%
To make things worse... they have set
their codes based on our film stars.

720
01:08:55.277 --> 01:08:58.442 line:82%
Tell me, who is supposed to be
Mallika Sherawat in the government?

721
01:08:58.647 --> 01:09:00.861 line:82%
I understand if they say
Gulshan Grover or Amrish Puri.

722
01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:04.312 line:82%
And not just films...
they are now into television as well.

723
01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:09.368 line:82%
One message has been intercepted
every day for the past 20 days.

724
01:09:09.694 --> 01:09:12.831 line:82%
That Zee TV will surely
cover the conference...

725
01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.653 line:82%
...but will Doordarshan also be there?

726
01:09:14.898 --> 01:09:17.319 line:82%
I just don't get it... what's their
connection with Doordarshan?

727
01:09:17.496 --> 01:09:19.061 line:82%
Who watches Doordarshan in any case?

728
01:09:19.402 --> 01:09:22.224 line:82%
Mr. Bagga, I want to see
those intercepts now!

729
01:09:26.277 --> 01:09:29.032 line:82%
See... I intercept all this every day.

730
01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:41.904 line:82%
Sonny... what are you looking for?
You need my help?

731
01:09:43.736 --> 01:09:45.942 line:82%
You asked for a desk assignment...

732
01:09:46.277 --> 01:09:49.040 line:82%
So why do you want to go
to Istanbul all of a sudden?

733
01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:52.569 line:82%
Sir, you know that there are more spies
than diplomats in these conferences.

734
01:09:52.908 --> 01:09:55.040 line:82%
Sir, there will be officials
from all over the world.

735
01:09:55.385 --> 01:09:58.252 line:82%
Sir, it's a gold mine of
intelligence information.

736
01:09:58.782 --> 01:10:00.839 line:82%
How can I miss this, Sir?

737
01:10:03.194 --> 01:10:07.357 line:82%
Okay, Tiger... pull out your
suits and let's go to Istanbul!

738
01:10:30.257 --> 01:10:33.354 line:82%
On the sidelines of this
UN Ministers' meeting...

739
01:10:33.777 --> 01:10:35.986 line:82%
...expectations are high as the Indian
and Pakistan Foreign Ministers...

740
01:10:36.236 --> 01:10:39.625 line:82%
On the sidelines of the UN Foreign
Ministers' Meeting at Istanbul...

741
01:10:40.156 --> 01:10:43.339 line:82%
It is anticipated that the Indian
and Pakistan foreign ministers...

742
01:10:43.579 --> 01:10:45.506 line:82%
...may have an informal meeting.

743
01:10:45.819 --> 01:10:48.829 line:82%
This is good news for the bilateral
relations of the two countries.

744
01:12:45.234 --> 01:12:49.026 line:82%
Get out of here...
my people will arrive soon.

745
01:12:55.567 --> 01:12:56.651 line:82%
Go...

746
01:12:58.609 --> 01:12:59.234 line:82%
Go!

747
01:13:47.999 --> 01:13:48.942 line:82%
Bored?

748
01:14:51.526 --> 01:14:53.106 line:82%
Hey... who are you?

749
01:14:53.401 --> 01:14:54.942 line:82%
Don't worry, I'm a friend of her's.

750
01:14:55.317 --> 01:14:56.403 line:82%
Drive towards the Old Town.

751
01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:57.651 line:82%
Old Town... okay?

752
01:14:57.942 --> 01:14:58.734 line:82%
Okay.

753
01:15:21.109 --> 01:15:22.435 line:82%
Why have you called me here, Zoya?

754
01:15:25.609 --> 01:15:26.609 line:82%
Tell me, Zoya.

755
01:15:27.109 --> 01:15:29.776 line:82%
It was very easy for you
to put a gun to my head...

756
01:15:29.933 --> 01:15:31.359 line:82%
...and tell me that you
love me... wasn't it?

757
01:15:31.567 --> 01:15:32.442 line:82%
As simple as that?

758
01:15:32.942 --> 01:15:35.055 line:82%
If the gun was in your hand...

759
01:15:35.984 --> 01:15:37.317 line:82%
I would have still said
the same thing.

760
01:15:37.567 --> 01:15:39.695 line:82%
It's not as easy as you think...

761
01:15:40.067 --> 01:15:43.359 line:82%
...the other agent who you killed...

762
01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.247 line:82%
Feroz... he was also right there.

763
01:15:47.817 --> 01:15:53.234 line:82%
A girl... whose training and duty
forbids her from falling in love...

764
01:15:54.526 --> 01:15:57.776 line:82%
...to whom could she say that yes,
she too was in love?

765
01:16:01.651 --> 01:16:05.116 line:82%
To the man whose real name
she didn't know?

766
01:16:05.692 --> 01:16:07.565 line:82%
To the man who was pointing
a gun at her?

767
01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:13.192 line:82%
And even had I said that...
what good would it have done?

768
01:16:14.151 --> 01:16:17.010 line:82%
The two of us can never be together.

769
01:16:19.109 --> 01:16:20.609 line:82%
And what does it mean to be together?

770
01:16:21.234 --> 01:16:23.417 line:82%
That we come and shake hands
every month at the Wagah border?

771
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:27.467 line:82%
Or send song requests for
one another on All India Radio?

772
01:16:28.192 --> 01:16:30.192 line:82%
I'm ISI... you're RAW.

773
01:16:32.901 --> 01:16:34.539 line:82%
We are enemies.

774
01:16:34.984 --> 01:16:37.352 line:82%
Our duty won't let us be together.

775
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:40.609 line:82%
Our people won't let us be together.

776
01:16:42.651 --> 01:16:45.180 line:82%
You know they'll come after us.

777
01:16:56.567 --> 01:16:58.139 line:82%
Yes, Captain Abrar...

778
01:16:59.276 --> 01:17:00.898 line:82%
I'm coming there...

779
01:17:01.401 --> 01:17:03.952 line:82%
Yes, sure... fine.

780
01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:36.355 line:82%
The sky

781
01:17:37.276 --> 01:17:39.442 line:82%
Yours and mine

782
01:17:40.151 --> 01:17:41.901 line:82%
Like our dreams

783
01:17:42.109 --> 01:17:44.192 line:82%
Has turned to smoke

784
01:17:44.692 --> 01:17:47.035 line:82%
The sky

785
01:17:47.651 --> 01:17:49.776 line:82%
Yours and mine

786
01:17:50.359 --> 01:17:52.192 line:82%
Like we breathe

787
01:17:52.379 --> 01:17:54.442 line:82%
Has turned to dust

788
01:17:56.026 --> 01:17:58.109 line:82%
Wherever you go

789
01:17:58.567 --> 01:18:00.859 line:82%
You will find me too

790
01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:05.026 line:82%
I am now a part of you

791
01:18:05.692 --> 01:18:07.776 line:82%
I am a lonely planet

792
01:18:08.234 --> 01:18:10.401 line:82%
You are a lonely planet

793
01:18:10.817 --> 01:18:12.984 line:82%
Beyond the world of stars

794
01:18:13.401 --> 01:18:15.276 line:82%
Let us come together

795
01:18:15.942 --> 01:18:18.151 line:82%
I am a lonely planet

796
01:18:18.484 --> 01:18:20.734 line:82%
You are a lonely planet

797
01:18:21.067 --> 01:18:23.317 line:82%
Beyond the world of stars

798
01:18:23.734 --> 01:18:25.817 line:82%
Let us come together

799
01:18:26.984 --> 01:18:28.651 line:82%
You caved me

800
01:18:29.526 --> 01:18:31.677 line:82%
You carved me

801
01:18:32.151 --> 01:18:33.609 line:82%
Because of you

802
01:18:34.026 --> 01:18:35.859 line:82%
I believe in me

803
01:18:37.276 --> 01:18:39.411 line:82%
You are not here

804
01:18:39.859 --> 01:18:41.276 line:82%
And that be true

805
01:18:42.442 --> 01:18:44.067 line:82%
But if I'm here

806
01:18:44.401 --> 01:18:46.409 line:82%
You are here too

807
01:18:47.609 --> 01:18:49.734 line:82%
Wherever you go

808
01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:52.587 line:82%
You will find me too

809
01:18:52.817 --> 01:18:56.942 line:82%
I am now a part of you

810
01:18:57.276 --> 01:18:59.401 line:82%
I am a lonely planet

811
01:18:59.817 --> 01:19:01.942 line:82%
You are a lonely planet

812
01:19:02.359 --> 01:19:04.813 line:82%
Beyond the world of stars

813
01:19:05.026 --> 01:19:07.192 line:82%
Let us come together

814
01:19:07.567 --> 01:19:09.692 line:82%
I am a lonely planet

815
01:19:10.151 --> 01:19:12.192 line:82%
You are a lonely planet

816
01:19:12.776 --> 01:19:15.030 line:82%
Beyond the world of stars

817
01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:17.651 line:82%
Let us come together

818
01:19:51.526 --> 01:19:53.102 line:82%
Hi... where have you been?

819
01:19:53.277 --> 01:19:54.174 line:82%
Thank you, sir.

820
01:19:54.359 --> 01:19:55.786 line:82%
You were gone all evening.

821
01:19:55.984 --> 01:19:57.026 line:82%
I was following a lead, sir.

822
01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.535 line:82%
Relax.

823
01:21:26.817 --> 01:21:28.442 line:82%
Can I please have the
pleasure of this dance?

824
01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.721 line:82%
I'm sorry but it's not
correct for me to...

825
01:21:32.484 --> 01:21:34.442 line:82%
What the hell is Tiger doing?

826
01:21:35.276 --> 01:21:37.007 line:82%
This is a peace conference...

827
01:21:40.734 --> 01:21:43.026 line:82%
...diplomats from all over the
world are dancing with each other.

828
01:21:44.526 --> 01:21:50.359 line:82%
Why are Indian and Pakistani
diplomats stuck in their corners?

829
01:21:51.276 --> 01:21:54.401 line:82%
This is not our protocol...
I'm sorry.

830
01:21:55.892 --> 01:21:57.288 line:82%
If you don't mind...

831
01:22:01.817 --> 01:22:02.859 line:82%
Thank you.

832
01:22:12.239 --> 01:22:13.986 line:82%
What the hell do you
think you are doing?

833
01:22:23.484 --> 01:22:25.197 line:82%
Zoya... you were right...

834
01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:27.890 line:82%
...the world will never
let us be together.

835
01:22:29.357 --> 01:22:31.364 line:82%
So let's create our own world.

836
01:22:32.859 --> 01:22:33.942 line:82%
Let's run away, Zoya.

837
01:22:34.234 --> 01:22:37.484 line:82%
You have gone mad.
Don't talk nonsense.

838
01:22:40.233 --> 01:22:43.391 line:82%
God alone knows how long our
two countries will keep fighting.

839
01:22:44.151 --> 01:22:45.734 line:82%
We cannot wait for them endlessly.

840
01:22:47.901 --> 01:22:50.935 line:82%
And it might be a little difficult
to run when we're old.

841
01:22:54.109 --> 01:23:01.783 line:82%
What happens to our lives after this
music ends is all in your hands, Zoya.

842
01:23:48.151 --> 01:23:49.067 line:82%
Tiger.

843
01:23:49.651 --> 01:23:50.484 line:82%
Tiger.

844
01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:53.489 line:82%
Hurry up... we have
to go to the airport!

845
01:23:54.359 --> 01:23:57.317 line:82%
Hello... Zoya, are you there?

846
01:23:57.817 --> 01:23:59.734 line:82%
We're getting late for the airport.

847
01:24:00.109 --> 01:24:03.199 line:82%
Please hurry and come down.

848
01:24:29.359 --> 01:24:31.859 line:82%
Sir, we can't get through to
Tiger's phone. He's out of reach...

849
01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:34.317 line:82%
Sir... I think he's been
kidnapped by the Pakistanis.

850
01:24:34.651 --> 01:24:36.398 line:82%
Kidnapped! Nonsense!

851
01:24:36.942 --> 01:24:38.375 line:82%
He's too good for them.

852
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:41.212 line:82%
Listen... this news
should not get out.

853
01:24:41.567 --> 01:24:42.276 line:82%
Okay, sir.

854
01:24:45.067 --> 01:24:46.609 line:82%
Gopi, where have you been?

855
01:24:46.859 --> 01:24:48.776 line:82%
Take the next flight from
London and get here.

856
01:25:10.276 --> 01:25:11.818 line:82%
Which bank has he withdrawn
the money from?

857
01:25:12.609 --> 01:25:13.651 line:82%
How much?

858
01:25:13.832 --> 01:25:16.359 line:82%
Sir... a total of 47 thousand
dollars, sir.

859
01:25:16.831 --> 01:25:19.484 line:82%
47 thousand dollars?

860
01:25:20.442 --> 01:25:21.942 line:82%
Sir... about 2.3 million Rupees.

861
01:25:26.401 --> 01:25:27.401 line:82%
Should be 2.3 million.

862
01:25:27.651 --> 01:25:31.961 line:82%
The day I retire...
I'll blow it all up.

863
01:25:35.133 --> 01:25:36.401 line:82%
Tiger has not been kidnapped!

864
01:25:54.651 --> 01:25:55.942 line:82%
Do you have any idea...

865
01:25:56.359 --> 01:26:00.942 line:82%
...how much classified information
Tiger has about our organisation?

866
01:26:02.901 --> 01:26:05.234 line:82%
If anyone gets hold
of that information...

867
01:26:05.609 --> 01:26:09.942 line:82%
...it will compromise the security
of our agents all over the world.

868
01:26:13.526 --> 01:26:17.812 line:82%
Sir... I don't know exactly
where Tiger is or what he's up to...

869
01:26:18.651 --> 01:26:22.126 line:82%
...but he will never give away that
kind of information whilst he's alive.

870
01:26:22.938 --> 01:26:24.317 line:82%
I'm certain about that.

871
01:26:24.526 --> 01:26:25.401 line:82%
Sir...

872
01:26:26.567 --> 01:26:27.442 line:82%
...we just heard that...

873
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:29.234 line:82%
...a Pakistani delegate is also
missing since this morning.

874
01:26:30.234 --> 01:26:31.151 line:82%
What?

875
01:27:03.526 --> 01:27:04.401 line:82%
Zoya?

876
01:27:06.692 --> 01:27:08.567 line:82%
This is the address of the hotel.

877
01:27:08.776 --> 01:27:09.484 line:82%
Okay.

878
01:27:10.234 --> 01:27:11.692 line:82%
This hotel belongs to his friend.

879
01:27:11.984 --> 01:27:14.234 line:82%
He'll help us book the
tickets for tomorrow.

880
01:27:15.734 --> 01:27:17.163 line:82%
How long will you take?

881
01:27:17.484 --> 01:27:20.907 line:82%
Might take a long. Maybe all night.
You take care.

882
01:27:21.257 --> 01:27:22.143 line:82%
Okay.

883
01:27:22.901 --> 01:27:24.526 line:82%
Sir... this is Zoya.

884
01:27:26.692 --> 01:27:31.526 line:82%
Gopi... do you know how many
countries are there in the world?

885
01:27:33.026 --> 01:27:33.901 line:82%
Sir?

886
01:27:34.276 --> 01:27:37.651 line:82%
There are 201 countries
in the world...

887
01:27:40.026 --> 01:27:43.359 line:82%
...and bloody Tiger could find
a girl only from Pakistan?

888
01:28:41.317 --> 01:28:43.484 line:82%
Captain Abrar.
Why have you called me here?

889
01:28:43.859 --> 01:28:45.692 line:82%
Meeting like this can derail
the whole plan.

890
01:28:45.984 --> 01:28:47.734 line:82%
Because I'm worried about you...

891
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:49.359 line:82%
...he is an extremely dangerous agent.

892
01:28:49.567 --> 01:28:52.401 line:82%
I am fine... but you will all
have to be a little more patient.

893
01:28:52.859 --> 01:28:54.734 line:82%
It's not that easy to trick him.

894
01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:56.067 line:82%
What you're saying is right...

895
01:28:56.276 --> 01:28:59.026 line:82%
...but we must know what you are
up to and where exactly are you?

896
01:28:59.359 --> 01:29:00.859 line:82%
He does not suspect me at all...

897
01:29:01.317 --> 01:29:03.567 line:82%
...but to get him to
you here is too risky.

898
01:29:04.192 --> 01:29:06.276 line:82%
I'll get him to you, but not here...

899
01:29:06.651 --> 01:29:09.178 line:82%
...there are too many Indians here...
looking for him.

900
01:29:10.401 --> 01:29:12.359 line:82%
I'll bring him to the airport
in a little while.

901
01:29:12.594 --> 01:29:14.734 line:82%
We'll catch the 10:30 flight
to Kazakhstan.

902
01:29:16.401 --> 01:29:17.984 line:82%
This is my disguise.

903
01:29:18.401 --> 01:29:20.859 line:82%
He'll be with me in disguise as well.

904
01:29:21.450 --> 01:29:22.984 line:82%
You can take our picture
at the airport...

905
01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:25.296 line:82%
...and send it to your
Kazakhstan station.

906
01:29:26.977 --> 01:29:27.942 line:82%
After that... he's all yours.

907
01:29:31.942 --> 01:29:33.026 line:82%
Take care of yourself...

908
01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:06.638 line:82%
Oh, my God!

909
01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:09.776 line:82%
For a second
I couldn't recognise you...

910
01:30:10.692 --> 01:30:12.317 line:82%
But I clearly recognised you.

911
01:30:13.192 --> 01:30:15.609 line:82%
Tickets done. Passports done.
Ready to go.

912
01:31:46.942 --> 01:31:49.942 line:82%
Listen to me carefully.
There on the right...

913
01:31:50.151 --> 01:31:53.174 line:82%
...there's a man in a black jacket with
a red suitcase who's having coffee...

914
01:31:53.442 --> 01:31:54.609 line:82%
...he's an ISI agent.

915
01:31:56.609 --> 01:31:58.067 line:82%
There at the luggage counter...

916
01:31:58.609 --> 01:31:59.526 line:82%
...the guy with the camera...

917
01:32:00.817 --> 01:32:02.734 line:82%
...behind him the man on the phone...

918
01:32:03.609 --> 01:32:04.692 line:82%
...he's ISI as well.

919
01:32:06.776 --> 01:32:10.442 line:82%
Come with me. Our flight
has been announced.

920
01:32:11.707 --> 01:32:13.484 line:82%
But our flight still
has an hour to go.

921
01:32:14.609 --> 01:32:15.942 line:82%
We're not going to Kazakhstan.

922
01:32:16.817 --> 01:32:17.901 line:82%
Then where are we going?

923
01:32:18.484 --> 01:32:20.317 line:82%
Let's see. Come quickly.

924
01:33:07.276 --> 01:33:08.276 line:82%
You knew all along?

925
01:33:10.317 --> 01:33:13.067 line:82%
I was an agent before
I became a lover.

926
01:33:13.734 --> 01:33:20.026 line:82%
But I had to do this because of
your drama at the ballroom that day.

927
01:33:21.317 --> 01:33:22.984 line:82%
Captain Abrar saw you and said...

928
01:33:23.234 --> 01:33:25.748 line:82%
...this prey has happily
walked to a trap.

929
01:33:26.484 --> 01:33:29.056 line:82%
And right then...
he made a plan to get you.

930
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:32.776 line:82%
But if you saw me
with Captain Abrar...

931
01:33:34.026 --> 01:33:35.609 line:82%
...then why did you come
to the airport with me?

932
01:33:35.859 --> 01:33:39.067 line:82%
Zoya... all my life
I've used only my head.

933
01:33:40.567 --> 01:33:44.155 line:82%
For once I followed my heart...

934
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:48.776 line:82%
I just wanted to see where
this decision would take me.

935
01:33:58.276 --> 01:34:02.219 line:82%
I'm amused at the thought of
what will happen in Kazakhstan now.

936
01:34:10.151 --> 01:34:11.736 line:82%
Seen anyone like her?

937
01:34:13.168 --> 01:34:15.665 line:82%
See there... in that car.

938
01:34:16.526 --> 01:34:19.151 line:82%
They look like bloody Indians.

939
01:34:19.624 --> 01:34:21.401 line:82%
Pakistani goons...

940
01:34:30.401 --> 01:34:31.234 line:82%
Captain Abrar.

941
01:34:31.442 --> 01:34:32.692 line:82%
Gopi, sir.

942
01:34:32.984 --> 01:34:36.317 line:82%
Sir... it's been close to four hours
since the Istanbul flight landed...

943
01:34:36.609 --> 01:34:37.734 line:82%
...and no one has shown up.

944
01:34:37.942 --> 01:34:38.609 line:82%
Alright.

945
01:34:42.651 --> 01:34:45.337 line:82%
Sir... the information
about Kazakhstan was wrong.

946
01:34:46.484 --> 01:34:47.930 line:82%
No one arrived there today.

947
01:34:50.192 --> 01:34:52.151 line:82%
There were two other big flights
that left Istanbul yesterday.

948
01:34:52.401 --> 01:34:53.859 line:82%
One to London and
the other to Frankfurt.

949
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:57.984 line:82%
Then find out from there how
many other flights departed.

950
01:34:58.734 --> 01:35:00.442 line:82%
Sir... there are 623 flights
at London...

951
01:35:00.608 --> 01:35:02.484 line:82%
...and 612 flights at Frankfurt
scheduled to take off today...

952
01:35:02.692 --> 01:35:05.859 line:82%
...total number of passengers
825,802...

953
01:35:06.234 --> 01:35:08.109 line:82%
...and those two could be traveling
on a passport of any nationality...

954
01:35:08.317 --> 01:35:09.692 line:82%
I don't care.

955
01:35:10.901 --> 01:35:13.659 line:82%
Keep searching...
we have to find them.

956
01:35:15.651 --> 01:35:17.098 line:82%
Sir... my point is...

957
01:35:17.734 --> 01:35:20.859 line:82%
...if Tiger has decided... then it
will be very difficult to find him.

958
01:35:21.401 --> 01:35:23.436 line:82%
We have created Tiger!

959
01:35:27.442 --> 01:35:29.571 line:82%
RAW was functioning before him...

960
01:35:30.692 --> 01:35:32.609 line:82%
...and will continue even after him.

961
01:35:39.442 --> 01:35:40.276 line:82%
Gopi...

962
01:35:41.984 --> 01:35:45.484 line:82%
The amount of information that
Tiger has about our organization...

963
01:35:46.609 --> 01:35:51.083 line:82%
...before ISI gets that information...

964
01:35:52.067 --> 01:35:55.484 line:82%
...we have to find Tiger
and bring him back.

965
01:35:59.692 --> 01:36:01.401 line:82%
And... if he doesn't want to return?

966
01:36:05.776 --> 01:36:10.764 line:82%
Then I'm sure you know
what we must do...

967
01:36:13.317 --> 01:36:15.129 line:82%
Just remember...

968
01:36:16.526 --> 01:36:20.615 line:82%
...no one should be able
to identify his body.

969
01:36:26.037 --> 01:36:27.634 line:82%
HAVANA - CUBA

970
01:37:05.192 --> 01:37:07.124 line:82%
Keep your eyes closed

971
01:37:07.442 --> 01:37:09.317 line:82%
And count slowly

972
01:37:09.651 --> 01:37:12.526 line:82%
Find me for I don't know where I am

973
01:37:14.067 --> 01:37:16.026 line:82%
Forgotten are our tales

974
01:37:16.317 --> 01:37:18.317 line:82%
We are strangers to our own land

975
01:37:18.567 --> 01:37:21.067 line:82%
See how we have turned into thin air

976
01:37:22.609 --> 01:37:24.317 line:82%
Close to the heart

977
01:37:24.901 --> 01:37:26.442 line:82%
Under the sheet of dreams

978
01:37:27.067 --> 01:37:28.401 line:82%
Is this lost world

979
01:37:28.817 --> 01:37:30.192 line:82%
Of ours

980
01:37:31.026 --> 01:37:32.484 line:82%
I am lost

981
01:37:35.484 --> 01:37:36.901 line:82%
You are lost

982
01:37:39.942 --> 01:37:41.442 line:82%
All our senses

983
01:37:44.317 --> 01:37:45.901 line:82%
Are all lost

984
01:38:25.192 --> 01:38:28.401 line:82%
Yes this is my wish

985
01:38:29.651 --> 01:38:32.609 line:82%
To think of only you

986
01:38:34.026 --> 01:38:37.484 line:82%
The glow that emanates from you

987
01:38:38.401 --> 01:38:41.567 line:82%
Will remain captured in my dreams

988
01:38:42.151 --> 01:38:44.234 line:82%
When did morning fall asleep?

989
01:38:44.901 --> 01:38:46.442 line:82%
When did the stars awaken?

990
01:38:47.067 --> 01:38:48.442 line:82%
We have forgotten...

991
01:38:48.817 --> 01:38:50.276 line:82%
...what happens when

992
01:38:51.067 --> 01:38:52.734 line:82%
I am lost

993
01:38:55.484 --> 01:38:56.609 line:82%
You are lost

994
01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:01.317 line:82%
All our senses

995
01:39:04.359 --> 01:39:05.984 line:82%
Are all lost

996
01:39:45.192 --> 01:39:47.984 line:82%
Yes I was breathing

997
01:39:49.651 --> 01:39:52.917 line:82%
But I was never alive

998
01:39:54.109 --> 01:39:57.647 line:82%
When I gave my heart away to you

999
01:39:58.567 --> 01:40:01.657 line:82%
I realized what a heartbeat was...

1000
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:04.276 line:82%
Immersed in you

1001
01:40:04.901 --> 01:40:06.526 line:82%
Lost in you

1002
01:40:07.151 --> 01:40:08.484 line:82%
Away from you

1003
01:40:08.817 --> 01:40:10.442 line:82%
Where do I go?

1004
01:40:11.067 --> 01:40:12.901 line:82%
I am lost

1005
01:40:15.484 --> 01:40:17.309 line:82%
You are lost

1006
01:40:19.942 --> 01:40:21.484 line:82%
All our senses

1007
01:40:24.359 --> 01:40:26.151 line:82%
Are all lost

1008
01:40:45.317 --> 01:40:46.548 line:82%
What does it mean?

1009
01:40:49.026 --> 01:40:50.692 line:82%
Sane love...

1010
01:40:51.734 --> 01:40:53.151 line:82%
...is no love

1011
01:40:55.567 --> 01:40:56.234 line:82%
Wow!

1012
01:41:36.609 --> 01:41:38.067 line:82%
Give me your money!

1013
01:41:39.859 --> 01:41:40.901 line:82%
Give me your money!

1014
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:46.276 line:82%
Give me your money!

1015
01:42:39.442 --> 01:42:42.067 line:82%
Zoya... let's get out of here.

1016
01:42:45.942 --> 01:42:48.484 line:82%
Zoya... let's get out of here.

1017
01:42:48.984 --> 01:42:50.651 line:82%
What language is it?

1018
01:42:51.401 --> 01:42:52.734 line:82%
Is it Arabic?

1019
01:42:53.692 --> 01:42:56.692 line:82%
No, not Arabic... sounds like...
Hindi or Bengali...

1020
01:42:57.234 --> 01:43:05.901 line:82%
Spoken in India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Afghanistan.

1021
01:43:08.137 --> 01:43:09.720 line:82%
NEW DELHI 10:30 P.M.

1022
01:43:10.234 --> 01:43:13.638 line:82%
Dayal. Why have you sent me this?

1023
01:43:13.901 --> 01:43:17.091 line:82%
Don't send me Embassy correspondence.

1024
01:43:17.984 --> 01:43:21.372 line:82%
You should be able to
handle this at your level.

1025
01:43:22.026 --> 01:43:24.526 line:82%
My brains get fried
with all this nonsense...

1026
01:43:24.817 --> 01:43:27.190 line:82%
...and especially when
I'm ready to go home...

1027
01:43:46.651 --> 01:43:47.692 line:82%
Which embassy?

1028
01:43:48.734 --> 01:43:50.651 line:82%
Havana, sir. Cuba.

1029
01:44:00.026 --> 01:44:02.320 line:82%
Honeymoon's over... Tiger.

1030
01:44:28.234 --> 01:44:29.567 line:82%
We're being watched.

1031
01:44:33.651 --> 01:44:34.692 line:82%
Eleven o' clock.

1032
01:44:37.984 --> 01:44:40.401 line:82%
You are right. We are being watched.

1033
01:45:15.484 --> 01:45:17.567 line:82%
Can you please come
back in 20 minutes?

1034
01:45:19.151 --> 01:45:19.776 line:82%
Yes, Zoya?

1035
01:45:19.942 --> 01:45:21.901 line:82%
They are saying that they need
the manager's authorisation...

1036
01:45:22.151 --> 01:45:24.667 line:82%
...for such a big amount...
and he's not there.

1037
01:45:24.984 --> 01:45:26.692 line:82%
...right now they can only
give half of that amount.

1038
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:28.151 line:82%
Okay... get that for now.

1039
01:45:43.026 --> 01:45:45.442 line:82%
The manager will be back in 20
minutes. This is all I could get.

1040
01:45:45.859 --> 01:45:47.667 line:82%
I will get a car with the money.

1041
01:45:47.942 --> 01:45:49.401 line:82%
You withdraw the rest of
the money from the bank.

1042
01:45:50.317 --> 01:45:53.048 line:82%
Don't worry. We'll be
out of here by evening.

1043
01:46:07.192 --> 01:46:08.734 line:82%
Police please?

1044
01:46:22.692 --> 01:46:25.359 line:82%
Stop now... you've run enough.

1045
01:46:37.401 --> 01:46:39.711 line:82%
Zoya, look what I found.

1046
01:46:40.317 --> 01:46:42.358 line:82%
Willy's jeep. The same '52 model.

1047
01:46:45.442 --> 01:46:48.901 line:82%
Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to remind you of your father.

1048
01:46:55.151 --> 01:46:56.401 line:82%
What happened?

1049
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:58.359 line:82%
It's over.

1050
01:47:02.026 --> 01:47:03.401 line:82%
They were waiting for you.

1051
01:47:04.192 --> 01:47:06.026 line:82%
We have to go and sit in that car.

1052
01:47:33.567 --> 01:47:34.901 line:82%
Tiger, don't try anything here.

1053
01:47:35.817 --> 01:47:39.650 line:82%
I know... they will kill
us here if they have to.

1054
01:47:45.692 --> 01:47:46.651 line:82%
Come...

1055
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:26.651 line:82%
Follow them... fast!

1056
01:48:27.442 --> 01:48:28.359 line:82%
Hurry up!

1057
01:49:21.734 --> 01:49:22.901 line:82%
Hey, stop.

1058
01:49:23.609 --> 01:49:24.567 line:82%
Wait... wait.

1059
01:49:29.901 --> 01:49:30.859 line:82%
Thank you.

1060
01:49:39.018 --> 01:49:39.818 line:82%
This way.

1061
01:50:41.859 --> 01:50:43.817 line:82%
Tiger... Tiger, come on! Fast!

1062
01:51:19.984 --> 01:51:20.984 line:82%
Stop it, Zoya!

1063
01:51:24.234 --> 01:51:25.192 line:82%
Enough!

1064
01:55:03.817 --> 01:55:06.067 line:82%
What is it that they
have and we don't?

1065
01:55:06.293 --> 01:55:07.264 line:82%
Five minutes are more than enough.

1066
01:55:07.398 --> 01:55:10.138 line:82%
I don't care. If you have
to shoot him... then do it.

1067
01:55:15.942 --> 01:55:17.109 line:82%
I'll call you back.

1068
01:55:17.442 --> 01:55:20.026 line:82%
So, Gopi... you want me to be shot?

1069
01:55:20.328 --> 01:55:21.567 line:82%
You deserve to be shot.

1070
01:55:21.942 --> 01:55:22.734 line:82%
What have I done?

1071
01:55:23.026 --> 01:55:24.473 line:82%
What have you done?

1072
01:55:26.151 --> 01:55:28.613 line:82%
Tiger, do you know how many
countries there are in the world?

1073
01:55:29.151 --> 01:55:33.276 line:82%
201 countries. There are
201 countries and you.

1074
01:55:33.468 --> 01:55:37.567 line:82%
203... after Kosovo
separated from Serbia.

1075
01:55:38.609 --> 01:55:39.484 line:82%
Okay...

1076
01:55:40.192 --> 01:55:42.234 line:82%
203 countries and you...

1077
01:55:42.418 --> 01:55:44.776 line:82%
No... 204...

1078
01:55:45.442 --> 01:55:47.359 line:82%
...because Montenegro also
separated from Serbia.

1079
01:55:47.651 --> 01:55:49.817 line:82%
I don't care whether there
are 203 or 204 countries!

1080
01:55:50.317 --> 01:55:52.234 line:82%
How can you elope with a Pakistani?

1081
01:55:53.442 --> 01:55:58.359 line:82%
Gopi... do you know how much
information Zoya can provide us?

1082
01:55:59.234 --> 01:56:00.442 line:82%
Do you have any idea?

1083
01:56:01.442 --> 01:56:03.401 line:82%
Zoya is ready to come to India
with us.

1084
01:56:05.317 --> 01:56:06.359 line:82%
Really?

1085
01:56:08.692 --> 01:56:09.609 line:82%
Then where is she?

1086
01:56:09.817 --> 01:56:10.972 line:82%
Call her... let's leave.

1087
01:56:12.859 --> 01:56:17.276 line:82%
For that I'll need you and your boys.

1088
01:56:17.901 --> 01:56:19.776 line:82%
Why? You just told
me that she's ready.

1089
01:56:20.317 --> 01:56:22.567 line:82%
Yes but those people
who she is with right now...

1090
01:56:22.817 --> 01:56:24.984 line:82%
...won't let her come
to India that easily.

1091
01:56:26.317 --> 01:56:27.276 line:82%
Who are they?

1092
01:56:27.984 --> 01:56:29.067 line:82%
Our friends...

1093
01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:34.947 line:82%
So let me get this straight.

1094
01:56:35.234 --> 01:56:39.467 line:82%
You want us to attack
the ISI in Cuba.

1095
01:56:39.817 --> 01:56:42.765 line:82%
Why? To kidnap a girl?

1096
01:56:44.151 --> 01:56:45.109 line:82%
Girl?

1097
01:56:46.442 --> 01:56:48.484 line:82%
The same girl was your
sister-in-law in Dublin...

1098
01:56:48.942 --> 01:56:51.089 line:82%
...when you found out
she was a Pakistani...

1099
01:56:51.692 --> 01:56:54.047 line:82%
...you demoted her from
sister-in-law to just a girl?

1100
01:56:56.651 --> 01:56:59.853 line:82%
Gopi... they are flying her to
Pakistan tomorrow morning.

1101
01:57:01.359 --> 01:57:02.567 line:82%
Hey caveman...

1102
01:57:02.942 --> 01:57:04.904 line:82%
...whatever needs to be done,
should be done now.

1103
01:57:09.151 --> 01:57:10.420 line:82%
What will Shenoy sir say?

1104
01:57:13.317 --> 01:57:16.859 line:82%
Tiger... Tiger... Tiger.

1105
01:57:17.776 --> 01:57:19.192 line:82%
What the hell is Tiger doing?

1106
01:57:26.151 --> 01:57:28.942 line:82%
That's the plan...
Tokas, you will be here.

1107
01:57:29.401 --> 01:57:29.942 line:82%
Sir.

1108
01:57:30.151 --> 01:57:31.692 line:82%
Bablu... you'll be at this point.

1109
01:57:31.984 --> 01:57:33.776 line:82%
Jassi, you will block them from here.

1110
01:57:34.026 --> 01:57:34.942 line:82%
Tiger... take this.

1111
01:57:35.151 --> 01:57:36.359 line:82%
Thanks, Gopi.

1112
01:57:37.067 --> 01:57:42.109 line:82%
You, caveman... you got an
entire army just to catch me?

1113
01:57:43.067 --> 01:57:44.859 line:82%
Sir... don't forget we came here
to catch that man...

1114
01:57:45.192 --> 01:57:46.317 line:82%
...from whom we learnt everything.

1115
01:57:46.526 --> 01:57:49.692 line:82%
One last time... you'll be here.

1116
01:57:50.401 --> 01:57:51.817 line:82%
Tomorrow morning sharp at eight.

1117
01:58:07.901 --> 01:58:09.817 line:82%
Our flight will take
off in two hours.

1118
01:58:11.151 --> 01:58:14.151 line:82%
Don't try anything strange
at the airport.

1119
01:58:19.192 --> 01:58:21.026 line:82%
Nothing is more precious
in the world for a woman...

1120
01:58:21.276 --> 01:58:23.688 line:82%
...than her honour and dignity.

1121
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:34.067 line:82%
And that Indian friend of yours...

1122
01:58:35.489 --> 01:58:37.873 line:82%
...he left you alone and
disappeared really fast?

1123
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.984 line:82%
Come on, come on!

1124
01:59:15.567 --> 01:59:17.484 line:82%
Come on, come on! Go, go!

1125
01:59:48.526 --> 01:59:49.942 line:82%
Hurry! Follow them, quick!

1126
01:59:57.526 --> 02:00:00.109 line:82%
You rascal... God made
you and broke that mould!

1127
02:00:01.317 --> 02:00:02.192 line:82%
Sister-in-law!

1128
02:00:15.984 --> 02:00:17.192 line:82%
Turn around! Now!

1129
02:00:27.692 --> 02:00:28.704 line:82%
Turn left!

1130
02:01:49.609 --> 02:01:51.871 line:82%
Come on, go go! Airpark!

1131
02:01:52.234 --> 02:01:53.651 line:82%
Come on! Move fast!

1132
02:02:17.692 --> 02:02:18.817 line:82%
Stop! Stop there!

1133
02:02:32.567 --> 02:02:34.151 line:82%
I will make it...
don't worry about me...

1134
02:02:34.359 --> 02:02:36.026 line:82%
...don't stop the plane
for anything...

1135
02:02:36.359 --> 02:02:38.192 line:82%
...we'll get just this one chance
for take off!

1136
02:03:16.734 --> 02:03:17.651 line:82%
Go, go, go!

1137
02:03:17.818 --> 02:03:18.579 line:82%
Cut them off!

1138
02:05:17.431 --> 02:05:20.685 line:82%
Hey, pilot... fly me to a safe place.

1139
02:05:40.859 --> 02:05:41.901 line:82%
Hello.

1140
02:05:42.484 --> 02:05:43.567 line:82%
Hello?

1141
02:05:44.067 --> 02:05:45.569 line:82%
Shenoy sir.

1142
02:05:54.442 --> 02:05:56.859 line:82%
Speak up... Avinash Singh Rathore.

1143
02:05:57.276 --> 02:06:01.535 line:82%
You've called me by my real
name for the very first time.

1144
02:06:02.067 --> 02:06:04.442 line:82%
You've shown your true
colours for the first time.

1145
02:06:04.859 --> 02:06:08.859 line:82%
No, sir... for the first time in
my life I truly followed by heart.

1146
02:06:09.359 --> 02:06:11.750 line:82%
You forgot your duty.

1147
02:06:12.567 --> 02:06:14.546 line:82%
No, sir. I never forget my duty.

1148
02:06:14.859 --> 02:06:16.526 line:82%
I remember my duty... my training.

1149
02:06:17.192 --> 02:06:21.334 line:82%
But I also understand that beyond
them Tiger is a human being too.

1150
02:06:21.817 --> 02:06:25.692 line:82%
You yourself said once...
it's not easy to live with regrets.

1151
02:06:26.734 --> 02:06:29.484 line:82%
To love your enemy is treachery.

1152
02:06:31.044 --> 02:06:34.679 line:82%
Sir... when I was falling in love...
no one told me she was the enemy...

1153
02:06:35.067 --> 02:06:39.984 line:82%
...and when I fell in love. I couldn't
understand why she was the enemy.

1154
02:06:43.484 --> 02:06:44.901 line:82%
- Tiger.
- Sir.

1155
02:06:45.192 --> 02:06:46.526 line:82%
How long will you keep running away?

1156
02:06:46.776 --> 02:06:52.254 line:82%
Sir... the day India and Pakistan
don't need RAW and ISI...

1157
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:54.642 line:82%
...that day we will come back.

1158
02:07:00.359 --> 02:07:01.317 line:82%
Good luck.

1159
02:07:05.567 --> 02:07:06.859 line:82%
Shenoy sir.

1160
02:07:23.067 --> 02:07:27.026 line:82%
Agent Tiger and Agent Zoya
have been listed as 'missing'...

1161
02:07:27.276 --> 02:07:29.325 line:82%
...in the files of RAW and ISI.

1162
02:07:30.484 --> 02:07:32.489 line:82%
But reports of them being seen...

1163
02:07:32.642 --> 02:07:32.910 line:82%
VENICE

1164
02:07:33.070 --> 02:07:35.438 line:82%
...have been reported
from all over the world.

1165
02:07:36.609 --> 02:07:40.409 line:82%
However, it's impossible to say if
they were actually Tiger and Zoya.

1166
02:07:40.585 --> 02:07:41.166 line:82%
CAPE TOWN

1167
02:07:42.033 --> 02:07:42.475 line:82%
ZURICH

1168
02:07:42.619 --> 02:07:47.191 line:82%
RAW and ISI have been searching
for them all over the world.

1169
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:50.609 line:82%
For the first time in their history...

1170
02:07:50.901 --> 02:07:53.462 line:82%
...these rival agencies have
worked together on a mission.

1171
02:07:53.667 --> 02:07:54.349 line:82%
LONDON

1172
02:07:56.817 --> 02:07:59.401 line:82%
Whichever corner of the world
Tiger and Zoya might be in...

1173
02:07:59.776 --> 02:08:03.249 line:82%
...they must be smiling
upon hearing this news.
