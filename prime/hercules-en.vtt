HERCULES: Atalanta, it's all right.

169
00:10:23.182 --> 00:10:25.584 line:83%
You certainly
are a hard man to find.

170
00:10:25.617 --> 00:10:27.653 line:83%
Maybe I don't want
anyone to find me.

171
00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:29.421 line:83%
I'm not just anyone.

172

My name is Ergenia,
daughter to Lord Cotys.

173
00:10:32.624 --> 00:10:35.461 line:83%
Your father is most fortunate to have
such a beautiful heir.

174
00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:39.182 line:83%
My father
is most unfortunate.

175

He battles a warlord.
Rhesus.

176

Our land is torn
by civil war.

177

Every day villages
are destroyed,

178
00:10:46.105 --> 00:10:47.570 line:83%
crops ruined,
innocents slaughtered.

179
00:10:48.224 --> 00:10:49.475 line:83%
We all have problems.

180
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.325 line:83%
Well, perhaps
I can convince you

181
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.381 line:83%
to make our problems
your own.

182
00:10:57.049 --> 00:10:59.105 line:83%
Unfortunately, my lady,
Hercules is fully committed

183
00:10:59.188 --> 00:11:00.660 line:83%
till the Feast of Dionysus.

184
00:11:01.153 --> 00:11:03.432 line:83%
We could, however,
advance you to the front of the line,

185
00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:05.007 line:83%
for the right price.

186

Hmm.

187
00:11:06.558 --> 00:11:08.257 line:83%
I thought heroes
fight for glory.

188
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.209 line:83%
But mercenaries
fight for gold.

189
00:11:10.562 --> 00:11:12.214 line:83%
Lord Cotys is a rich man.

190
00:11:12.398 --> 00:11:13.550 line:83%
I like him already.

191
00:11:13.694 --> 00:11:14.867 line:83%
If you agree to aid him,

192
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:17.336 line:83%
he will pay
your weight in gold.

193

It is good to see you safe,
my lady.

This war claims
more victims every day.

199

We were concerned, my lady.

200
00:12:51.763 --> 00:12:54.527 line:83%
Thank you, General Sitacles.
I was well protected.

201
00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:56.235 line:83%
Ah.

202
00:12:56.268 --> 00:12:59.438 line:83%
The mighty Hercules.
An honor.

203
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.509 line:83%
But not quite
as big an honor as I expected.

204
00:13:04.643 --> 00:13:07.313 line:83%
General, go tell my father
Hercules is here.

205
00:13:11.483 --> 00:13:14.453 line:83%
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

206
00:13:15.187 --> 00:13:16.555 line:83%
It's meant to be.

207
00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.724 line:83%
It took five years
and a thousand men

208
00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.259 line:83%
to build her temple.

209
00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:22.011 line:83%
Hera is the patron
goddess of Thrace.

210
00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:24.030 line:83%
Everyone knows the legend.

211
00:13:24.063 --> 00:13:26.479 line:83%
How Hera seeks
to destroy Hercules.

212

Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

My name is Arius.
I know all your Labors by heart.

218
00:13:42.248 --> 00:13:45.051 line:83%
You killed the giant Geryon
with a single blow,

219
00:13:45.084 --> 00:13:46.885 line:83%
cleaned the Augean
stables in one night.

220
00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:47.987 line:83%
Hercules is probably tired.

221

And the Labor of the Hide,
