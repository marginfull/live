1
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.759 line:80%
This place sucks whenever I come here.

2
00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:01.979 line:80%
I'm Prosecutor Choi Tae-su
from Criminal Division 3.

3
00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:14.033 line:80%
You were born with a silver spoon.
You're pretty and probably well-mannered.

4
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:18.454 line:80%
Everyone treats you nicely,
so nothing's hard for you.

5
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.918 line:80%
But things are different now.

6
00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:28.923 line:80%
Everyone thinks
this is just a formality, but...

7
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.092 line:80%
It is.
This investigation is just a formality.

8
00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:36.472 line:80%
Look here, Ms. Oh Yu-ra!

9
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.057 line:80%
Look here, Prosecutor!

10
00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:42.186 line:80%
It's not the time for a mere prosecutor
to act up.

11
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.899 line:80%
Do I look like a fool who'd be scared
after seeing you rush in here?

12
00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:53.364 line:80%
You're not sure about anything.

13
00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:03.332 line:80%
Would it be faster for me to say
what you want to hear out of fear,

14
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.169 line:80%
or to get out of here on my own?

15
00:02:11.507 --> 00:02:12.758 line:80%
Do you want to bet?

16
00:02:32.403 --> 00:02:34.113 line:80%
-Goodbye, ma'am!
-Goodbye, ma'am!

17
00:02:41.412 --> 00:02:43.289 line:80%
The world must be going crazy.

18
00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:46.458 line:80%
Everyone keeps crossing the line.

19
00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:51.672 line:80%
This is for the best.
They can't do anything with that file.

20
00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.648 line:80%
You didn't have to come here.

21
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:12.818 line:80%
There was a misunderstanding.

22
00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:17.531 line:80%
I guess I'm not a great judge
of character.

23
00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:18.657 line:80%
Oh Yu-ra.

24
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.786 line:80%
You crossed the line this time.

25
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.206 line:80%
Turn in your resignation.

26
00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:32.212 line:80%
Don't think about exercising your rights
over the airline and tour company shares.

27
00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:34.924 line:80%
Soon,

28
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:38.844 line:80%
U&K Foundation will send
a volunteer group to Africa. Join them.

29
00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:42.389 line:80%
Go and volunteer and volunteer some more.

30
00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:48.771 line:80%
And once you've built character,
you can return then.

31
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.733 line:80%
I gave you the position,
and it ruined you.

32
00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:58.364 line:80%
Still, it's a big privilege
to have another chance.

33
00:03:58.948 --> 00:04:00.199 line:80%
Keep that in mind.

34
00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:04.286 line:80%
No.

35
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:10.125 line:80%
Why would I resign?
Why should I volunteer?

36
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.711 line:80%
Africa?

37
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:20.094 line:80%
Right. You must like her. Don't you?

38
00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:26.058 line:80%
Ji-hyuk is family after all,
so you want to let him do what he wants.

39
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.899 line:80%
Do it, then.

40
00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.865 line:80%
But don't touch me.

41
00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.784 line:80%
What did I do wrong?

42
00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:47.079 line:80%
You're pretending to be fair.

43
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.456 line:80%
But you're not.

44
00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:08.600 line:80%
I told him it'd be no use,
but he didn't know you at all.

45
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.563 line:80%
What the hell are you saying?

46
00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.984 line:80%
I'm exhausted. Let's talk tomorrow.

47
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:21.155 line:80%
You shouldn't have messed with Ji-won.

48
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:26.910 line:80%
What?

49
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.788 line:80%
What did I do?

50
00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:34.251 line:80%
No. Even if I did do something,
do you have proof?

51
00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:36.587 line:80%
Yes.

52
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.423 line:80%
I do.

53
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.329 line:80%
What's wrong? Did you see a ghost?

54
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.249 line:80%
What do I have to do?

55
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.794 line:80%
Tell me what I don't know.

56
00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:27.888 line:80%
-Are you crazy?
-Hurry!

57
00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.115 line:80%
Pay for what you did.

58
00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.327 line:80%
Your problem is thinking
you can do anything you want.

59
00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:53.122 line:80%
Stop trying to get away with it.

60
00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:54.957 line:80%
Pay properly.

61
00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.709 line:80%
Jeong Man-sik, Bae Hui-suk.

62
00:06:57.793 --> 00:07:00.754 line:80%
You're under arrest for attempted murder.

63
00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:05.050 line:80%
Yeah, yeah.
I'll tell you everything. Everything.

64
00:07:10.514 --> 00:07:14.935 line:80%
Now that Jeong Man-sik's showed up,
I'd like to talk to you again, Ms. Oh.

65
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.263 line:80%
Mom!

66
00:07:52.264 --> 00:07:54.474 line:80%
-Ju-ran.
-Princess.

67
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.151 line:80%
Goodness.

68
00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.321 line:80%
Jeong Su-min did something like that?

69
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:57.204 line:80%
Mr. Park's funeral was held
just downstairs, but I had no idea.

70
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.414 line:80%
It feels strange.

71
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.000 line:80%
If I had known, I would have--

72
00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:03.877 line:80%
You still shouldn't have.

73
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.839 line:80%
You can't go to a funeral
before a major surgery.

74
00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.511 line:80%
You're nagging again.

75
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.429 line:80%
The surgery went well.

76
00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:16.598 line:80%
Because the surgery went well.

77
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:20.143 line:80%
You got scared and cried before.
Shall I keep going?

78
00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:25.816 line:80%
Anyway, since the SD card's data
was recovered,

79
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.276 line:80%
things got easier.

80
00:09:28.277 --> 00:09:32.656 line:80%
The court will take recent threats
into account seriously as well.

81
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.366 line:80%
It'll all work out.

82
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:38.537 line:80%
You might be able to get
both parental rights and custody.

83
00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:42.833 line:80%
Well, let's make him
lose visitation rights as well.

84
00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:49.381 line:80%
Then Yeon-ji will lose his father
for good.

85
00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:59.057 line:80%
You don't have to if you don't want to.

86
00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:04.896 line:80%
The choice is yours.

87
00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:08.859 line:80%
I'm happy about it.

88
00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:18.243 line:80%
When I got the surgery,

89
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.414 line:80%
it felt like I was dying once.

90
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.044 line:80%
Do I look like a bum?

91
00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.378 line:80%
Do I play all day?

92
00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:31.590 line:80%
I couldn't see the end, so it was so hard.

93
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:35.260 line:80%
Stop it!

94
00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.015 line:80%
I was even betrayed.

95
00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:47.522 line:80%
But...

96
00:10:49.775 --> 00:10:51.610 line:80%
I got a new chance.

97
00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.244 line:80%
Lee Jae-won, that bastard.

98
00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:05.040 line:80%
He'll probably try to milk Yeon-ji later.

99
00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.709 line:80%
He'll never be helpful for her.

100
00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.421 line:80%
I can't let her suffer like that.

101
00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.715 line:80%
He's nothing but a birth father.

102
00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:17.761 line:80%
I...

103
00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:21.598 line:80%
will stay strong.

104
00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:26.645 line:80%
I'll try a little harder too.

105
00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:48.041 line:80%
FINAL EPISODE

106
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.149 line:80%
God, you scared me.

107
00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.528 line:80%
I'm sorry. I was just happy to see you.

108
00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:23.577 line:80%
Well, Ji-won wanted to finalize
the factory manufacturing recipe today.

109
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.080 line:80%
She wanted to discuss that.
That's why I came.

110
00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:29.082 line:80%
Did she go somewhere?

111
00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:33.170 line:80%
Ms. Kang's meeting with
the development team is running late.

112
00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:37.757 line:80%
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'll explain.
Follow me this way.

113
00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:47.058 line:80%
The spinach pasta with sea snails,
the perilla cream pasta,

114
00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:50.812 line:80%
and the sweet pumpkin soup.
Please check the recipes again.

115
00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:53.482 line:80%
Also...

116
00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:58.778 line:80%
By the way,
did I do something wrong to you?

117
00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:00.697 line:80%
What?

118
00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.284 line:80%
I mean,
you weren't here when I came last time.

119
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.622 line:80%
And you're being kind of unfriendly today.

120
00:13:10.332 --> 00:13:11.583 line:80%
I'm happy to see you.

121
00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:17.923 line:80%
I'm clueless,
so I wouldn't know if you don't tell me.

122
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:23.595 line:80%
So if I did something wrong, I'm sorry.

123
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.057 line:80%
Even if didn't, I'm sorry.

124
00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.061 line:80%
Did you notice I was away?

125
00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.354 line:80%
Of course.

126
00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.147 line:80%
I looked for you.

127
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.359 line:80%
Why would you?

128
00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:39.653 line:80%
What?

129
00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:43.573 line:80%
Well...

130
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:48.828 line:80%
Right. I brought a Basque cake I made
last time and the time before.

131
00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:50.664 line:80%
Because...

132
00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:55.460 line:80%
I remembered how you loved it.

133
00:13:55.544 --> 00:13:58.338 line:80%
Who's the person
that sent such a great cake?

134
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.549 line:80%
This is love itself!

135
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:06.137 line:80%
I bought a new oven,
and it's insanely good, you know.

136
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:11.101 line:80%
So whatever dish I make,
it tastes three times as good.

137
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.729 line:80%
I guess it's why I kept cooking.

138
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.607 line:80%
By the way, your ears...

139
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.985 line:80%
are so big and pretty.

140
00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:24.322 line:80%
What are you doing?

141
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:28.868 line:80%
You can't touch someone's ear like that.

142
00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.329 line:80%
Why not?

143
00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:34.124 line:80%
What? I don't know.

144
00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.209 line:80%
But you can't do it.

145
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.420 line:80%
Can I touch your hands, then?

146
00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:42.257 line:80%
Of course. You can touch my hands,
but my ears are sensitive...

147
00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.900 line:80%
I think I like you.

148
00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.194 line:80%
What?

149
00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.512 line:80%
When it comes to life,

150
00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:32.098 line:80%
you can't have both.

151
00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:34.225 line:80%
What I mean is,

152
00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.812 line:80%
as long as he inherits U&K,

153
00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:40.315 line:80%
it won't be easy to harmonize

154
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:45.403 line:80%
your personal happiness
and his social responsibilities.

155
00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:53.495 line:80%
What?

156
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.082 line:80%
It's just that...

157
00:15:57.165 --> 00:16:02.379 line:80%
The way you speak is
very similar to the way Ji-hyuk does.

158
00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.676 line:80%
He does talk kind of like Grandfather.

159
00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.847 line:80%
See! Look at that!

160
00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:16.309 line:80%
See! They have the same tastes!
Look at their pick.

161
00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:18.395 line:80%
I'm disappointed in you, Grandfather.

162
00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.777 line:80%
I'll try very hard.

163
00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:31.032 line:80%
I know I was given a precious opportunity.

164
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.246 line:80%
I'll make sure to be less greedy
and more generous in life.

165
00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:40.417 line:80%
Do you think it's that easy?

166
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.878 line:80%
If it doesn't work...

167
00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.385 line:80%
I'll try harder!

168
00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.858 line:80%
Can I continue eating now?

169
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.861 line:80%
Sure, eat up.
I guess I spoke for too long.

170
00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.283 line:80%
I'm sorry. I talked too much.

171
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:29.841 line:80%
Thank you.

172
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:33.261 line:80%
Now, let's toast to Chef Eun-ho's success!

173
00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:35.221 line:80%
And to a successful divorce!

174
00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:37.807 line:80%
And to successful love! Let's go!

175
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.267 line:80%
Cheers!

176
00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.318 line:80%
Beer tastes the best this way.

177
00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:53.907 line:80%
Don't be surprised. This must be
his first time eating food like this.

178
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:58.286 line:80%
What are you talking about? He eats
pork
gukbap
with tons of
jeongguji
.

179
00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.667 line:80%
Tons of what? What's that?

180
00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:08.838 line:80%
She doesn't know what it is.
It's no use talking to her.

181
00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.256 line:80%
You're right.

182
00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:16.638 line:80%
I really feel like
I came back from the dead.

183
00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:20.850 line:80%
I'm surprised by you two,
but how are you two siblings?

184
00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.229 line:80%
They don't look alike at all.

185
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.982 line:80%
What? You said we did!

186
00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.526 line:80%
-I did?
-Yeah.

187
00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.611 line:80%
-When?
-You don't remember?

188
00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:38.117 line:80%
It's strange that you're here too,
Mr. Lee.

189
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:43.623 line:80%
Let me be clear.
I'm not here for you, Ms. Yang.

190
00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:47.460 line:80%
-I work for the U&K family--
-Yes. That's what I meant.

191
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.883 line:80%
You're an incredible person
to the U&K family.

192
00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:57.637 line:80%
But Mr. Yu is a member of the family,

193
00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.766 line:80%
thus you're here. That's very surprising.

194
00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:09.107 line:80%
Wait, am I being too comfortable now?

195
00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:14.279 line:80%
I'm part of the owner's family too.

196
00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:19.659 line:80%
Also, Mr. Lee wouldn't come to an occasion
like this even if the owner told him to--

197
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.500 line:80%
It's part of my job to make sure
the owner's family watch what they say.

198
00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:37.343 line:80%
Is he always like that?

199
00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:45.476 line:80%
It's so good.

200
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.103 line:80%
We ordered everything in.

201
00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:50.648 line:80%
-Bye.
-Get home safe.

202
00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:51.774 line:80%
It's raining.

203
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.822 line:80%
What do we do?

204
00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:00.158 line:80%
We only have two umbrellas.

205
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.327 line:80%
I drove here, so I'm good.

206
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.247 line:80%
It's on my way...

207
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.461 line:80%
What's on your way?

208
00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:15.006 line:80%
If you mean my home,
you could give me a ride.

209
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.178 line:80%
I can just run and catch the bus.

210
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:24.474 line:80%
Why don't I give you a ride?
If that's okay with you.

211
00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.351 line:80%
It's the opposite direction.

212
00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.356 line:80%
Shall I?

213
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:32.440 line:80%
That works out.

214
00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.068 line:80%
The elevator's here.

215
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.364 line:80%
Thanks for coming today.

216
00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:40.531 line:80%
Get home safe.

217
00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:42.283 line:80%
Have a good rest, Ms. Kang.

218
00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.286 line:80%
And Ji-hyuk, you rest or whatever.

219
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:53.920 line:80%
But why are
Eun-ho and Hui-yeon going together?

220
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:57.715 line:80%
And toasted for successful love.
What was that about?

221
00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.051 line:80%
My goodness, you're so clueless.

222
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:03.388 line:80%
I'm going in.

223
00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:10.728 line:80%
Eun-ho likes Hui-yeon? Why?

224
00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:14.482 line:80%
I don't understand.

225
00:22:21.758 --> 00:22:23.051 line:80%
Be careful.

226
00:23:04.842 --> 00:23:06.052 line:80%
What are you doing?

227
00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:09.013 line:80%
Are you up?

228
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:12.558 line:80%
It would've been better
to stay unconscious.

229
00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:21.776 line:80%
Fire spreads more because of curtains.

230
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:25.446 line:80%
Sturdy buildings are insulated...

231
00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:34.455 line:80%
You need to study to do anything.

232
00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:50.805 line:80%
Ji-won.

233
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:54.892 line:80%
I'm sorry.

234
00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:56.769 line:80%
I'm sorry.

235
00:23:58.688 --> 00:24:00.064 line:80%
We can't do anything about it now.

236
00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:01.649 line:80%
We can't do anything about it now.

237
00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:03.401 line:80%
You always think only about yourself.

238
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:05.319 line:80%
You always think only about yourself.

239
00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:21.210 line:80%
You really do live up to my expectations.

240
00:24:23.754 --> 00:24:24.839 line:80%
What?

241
00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:30.928 line:80%
I was worried
that you'd be a little smarter.

242
00:24:31.012 --> 00:24:32.138 line:80%
But...

243
00:24:33.723 --> 00:24:35.016 line:80%
I overestimated you.

244
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:40.396 line:80%
This is the best you can do.

245
00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:43.900 line:80%
Seeing you hit rock bottom like this...

246
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:48.863 line:80%
It suits you more than anything.

247
00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.871 line:80%
Stop acting tough.

248
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.540 line:80%
You're the worst here.

249
00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:03.336 line:80%
You dumped Min-hwan on me
knowing he was trash.

250
00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:05.546 line:80%
Look at you now.

251
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:10.259 line:80%
You threw me in the garbage
and took everything good for yourself.

252
00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:14.513 line:80%
Is that why you killed Min-hwan?

253
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:16.766 line:80%
Why shouldn't I?

254
00:25:18.309 --> 00:25:20.436 line:80%
He tried to kill me first.

255
00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:24.315 line:80%
It doesn't matter. There's no proof.

256
00:25:26.943 --> 00:25:31.197 line:80%
I'll turn myself in. I'll say
it was an accident and I ran out of fear.

257
00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:34.700 line:80%
If I pretend to regret it so much,

258
00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:41.916 line:80%
as always, people will take pity on me.

259
00:25:45.753 --> 00:25:46.837 line:80%
Right.

260
00:25:47.964 --> 00:25:50.007 line:80%
You're good at playing the victim.

261
00:25:56.222 --> 00:25:57.265 line:80%
I did it.

262
00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:02.853 line:80%
I won.

263
00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:19.203 line:80%
No, I won.

264
00:26:38.973 --> 00:26:42.393 line:80%
I learned so many things because of you.

265
00:26:43.477 --> 00:26:45.354 line:80%
You knew I was coming?

266
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.275 line:80%
You dragged me around
and took everything from me.

267
00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:53.070 line:80%
I felt so sorry for myself.

268
00:26:54.155 --> 00:26:57.283 line:80%
So I decided to face you this time
instead of running.

269
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:05.916 line:80%
Don't hide behind me
or anyone else anymore.

270
00:27:08.002 --> 00:27:09.962 line:80%
You face the consequences

271
00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:12.048 line:80%
of your actions now.

272
00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:15.509 line:80%
Face the consequences?

273
00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:19.138 line:80%
I'll get manslaughter.

274
00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:24.352 line:80%
Just you wait.

275
00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:29.523 line:80%
It's not manslaughter anymore.

276
00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:33.861 line:80%
You...

277
00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:39.283 line:80%
just made the evidence
with your own mouth.

278
00:27:58.386 --> 00:28:01.097 line:80%
PENSION MURDER CASE

279
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.140 line:80%
MURDER SUSPECT ON THE LOOSE

280
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.269 line:80%
I first met her in the bathroom at work.

281
00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:11.440 line:80%
When I got out of the stall,
she covered me with her cardigan.

282
00:28:11.524 --> 00:28:12.650 line:80%
I thought,

283
00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:14.735 line:80%
"I found my sister."

284
00:28:14.819 --> 00:28:16.570 line:80%
-Stop it.
-It was that moment.

285
00:28:17.822 --> 00:28:20.991 line:80%
But my brother said he liked her, so...

286
00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:23.285 line:80%
Jeong Su-min bought thinner?

287
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:27.623 line:80%
Yes, the police are strengthening
their search around there.

288
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:30.126 line:80%
I asked them to watch the house too.

289
00:28:31.085 --> 00:28:33.045 line:80%
We'll add more security as well.

290
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:37.341 line:80%
It's better you don't.

291
00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:41.512 line:80%
She's coming for me. Let her.

292
00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:45.850 line:80%
I'm against this.

293
00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:48.811 line:80%
When I said I'd do everything you wanted,

294
00:28:48.894 --> 00:28:51.564 line:80%
I didn't mean
I'd let dangerous things happen.

295
00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:53.858 line:80%
I'm not saying to stand aside.

296
00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:57.111 line:80%
She bought thinner.
That means she'll set a fire.

297
00:28:57.194 --> 00:28:59.447 line:80%
What's the use of
stopping her from coming?

298
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.991 line:80%
-Ji-won.
-How long will you block her?

299
00:29:02.074 --> 00:29:03.742 line:80%
How long will we run away?

300
00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:09.790 line:80%
When I got another chance at life,

301
00:29:09.874 --> 00:29:12.168 line:80%
I promised not to run away anymore.

302
00:29:13.627 --> 00:29:15.379 line:80%
Then I'll do it.

303
00:29:15.463 --> 00:29:16.755 line:80%
I'll lure her and...

304
00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:19.258 line:80%
Do you think she'll show herself to you?

305
00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:25.890 line:80%
She's trying to ruin me.

306
00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:29.852 line:80%
I have to deal with her.

307
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.865 line:80%
I'll go crazy because of you.

308
00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:13.312 line:80%
You want me to practice this?

309
00:30:14.063 --> 00:30:15.981 line:80%
-Now, one!
-One!

310
00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:19.777 line:80%
We did what you wanted.
Let me do what I want this time.

311
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.445 line:80%
-One.
-Two.

312
00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:26.075 line:80%
Next, one!

313
00:30:27.493 --> 00:30:28.619 line:80%
Two!

314
00:30:33.249 --> 00:30:35.709 line:80%
It's okay. One more time. Shout properly.

315
00:30:35.793 --> 00:30:37.753 line:80%
-One!
-One!

316
00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:38.921 line:80%
Two!

317
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:58.023 line:80%
This is the price for your sins
and hell I made for you.

318
00:31:00.234 --> 00:31:01.235 line:80%
Take it.

319
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.368 line:80%
Ms. Jeong Su-min.

320
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:13.706 line:80%
You're under arrest for murder
and attempted arson.

321
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:16.917 line:80%
You have the right to an attorney,
to defend yourself,

322
00:31:17.001 --> 00:31:20.170 line:80%
to file a false arrest suit,
and to remain silent.

323
00:31:22.673 --> 00:31:24.425 line:80%
What are you doing? Take her.

324
00:31:24.508 --> 00:31:25.342 line:80%
No.

325
00:31:27.261 --> 00:31:28.554 line:80%
It wasn't me.

326
00:31:28.637 --> 00:31:30.347 line:80%
Kang Ji-won set this up!

327
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:31.640 line:80%
It wasn't me!

328
00:31:31.724 --> 00:31:35.603 line:80%
It was her! It was Kang Ji-won!

329
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.271 line:80%
It wasn't me!

330
00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:38.480 line:80%
We'll call you.

331
00:31:47.448 --> 00:31:48.741 line:80%
It's all over now.

332
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:10.763 line:80%
Only good things will happen from now on.

333
00:32:13.015 --> 00:32:14.892 line:80%
I'll make sure of that.

334
00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:23.817 line:80%
I'll protect you forever.

335
00:32:29.198 --> 00:32:31.408 line:80%
So don't think about it anymore.

336
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.915 line:80%
You took back what was rightfully yours.

337
00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:43.837 line:80%
And I got an opportunity that wasn't mine.

338
00:32:49.093 --> 00:32:51.136 line:80%
That's why I have you in my arms.

339
00:32:57.518 --> 00:33:00.062 line:80%
So you have to be better to me.

340
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:04.024 line:80%
How can I do that?

341
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:11.573 line:80%
Like this?

342
00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:15.327 line:80%
Or...

343
00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:19.164 line:80%
like this?

344
00:33:51.572 --> 00:33:54.074 line:80%
Prosecutor Choi applied
for your travel ban.

345
00:33:54.575 --> 00:33:56.535 line:80%
You must leave the country today.

346
00:33:56.618 --> 00:33:57.953 line:80%
What time's the flight?

347
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:02.332 line:80%
Flights three and four hours from now.
I booked each one. Let's hurry.

348
00:34:05.711 --> 00:34:07.963 line:80%
You can't do anything right.

349
00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:10.007 line:80%
You're fired.

350
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.302 line:80%
Give me the tickets.

351
00:35:06.772 --> 00:35:09.358 line:80%
DAD

352
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.631 line:80%
Ji-won.

353
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.261 line:80%
What is it? Is something wrong?

354
00:36:23.891 --> 00:36:25.142 line:80%
It's gone.

355
00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:46.330 line:80%
Former Vice President Oh Yu-ra
of Cloud Air

356
00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:49.416 line:80%
was in a car accident
near Incheon Airport.

357
00:36:49.499 --> 00:36:52.961 line:80%
She was transferred to the hospital
but ended up dead.

358
00:36:53.045 --> 00:36:55.714 line:80%
She was being investigated
by the prosecution

359
00:36:55.797 --> 00:36:58.675 line:80%
for the dump truck attempted murder case.

360
00:36:58.759 --> 00:37:01.720 line:80%
She denied the charges
and pled not guilty,

361
00:37:01.803 --> 00:37:06.808 line:80%
but the prosecution secured the evidence
and applied for Oh's travel ban.

362
00:37:06.892 --> 00:37:11.563 line:80%
After the accident, her family accused
the prosecution of unreasonable methods.

363
00:37:11.647 --> 00:37:15.859 line:80%
The prosecution has expressed
their regret over Oh's death

364
00:37:15.943 --> 00:37:19.154 line:80%
but said
they'd get to the bottom of the accident.

Thank you. It was all thanks to you.

It's hot outside. Do you want a ride?

370
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:16.962 line:80%
No, I'm spending my first day as a single
with my friends.

371
00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:20.424 line:80%
I should go.

372
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.398 line:80%
I'll buy you a meal.

373
00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:38.483 line:80%
Nothing too expensive.

374
00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:40.235 line:80%
A moderately expensive meal.

375
00:38:41.695 --> 00:38:42.612 line:80%
Can I do that?

376
00:38:49.161 --> 00:38:50.454 line:80%
Thanks.

-This is nice.
-Right?

381
00:39:02.299 --> 00:39:04.426 line:80%
Okay, since my precious friend

382
00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:08.221 line:80%
opened a new restaurant,
I'll buy the most expensive dish!

383
00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:11.141 line:80%
Are you sure?

384
00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:14.269 line:80%
Then, to all the special people
who helped me make

385
00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:17.522 line:80%
the most successful
and best meal kit I could,

386
00:39:17.606 --> 00:39:20.650 line:80%
I'll give you the most expensive dish
on the house!

387
00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:24.821 line:80%
If Eun-ho's paying, what shall we pick?

388
00:39:24.905 --> 00:39:26.281 line:80%
No.

389
00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:31.203 line:80%
To celebrate my divorce, I'm paying.
So let's have the most expensive dish.

390
00:39:31.286 --> 00:39:32.996 line:80%
Good days deserve good food.

391
00:39:34.956 --> 00:39:36.792 line:80%
It's so beautiful here.

392
00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:38.794 line:80%
It's the best.

393
00:39:39.336 --> 00:39:41.588 line:80%
-I'll get you good wine.
-Okay, thanks.

394
00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:10.200 line:80%
The turkey looks too full.
Isn't that too much?

395
00:40:11.326 --> 00:40:12.661 line:80%
It's not.

396
00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:14.663 line:80%
Just wait.

397
00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:17.833 line:80%
I have my own method for this.

398
00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:20.335 line:80%
My father taught it to me.

399
00:40:21.128 --> 00:40:24.506 line:80%
And when I have kids later,
I'll teach them too.

400
00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:28.093 line:80%
That's right.

401
00:40:28.176 --> 00:40:30.554 line:80%
Have you thought of cute baby names?

402
00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:51.366 line:80%
I'm not saying
we should have kids right away.

403
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.618 line:80%
Well... I just thought

404
00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:59.332 line:80%
it'd be nice to take our time
thinking of good names together.

405
00:41:00.417 --> 00:41:02.586 line:80%
I know,

406
00:41:02.669 --> 00:41:06.006 line:80%
but we don't know what will happen.

407
00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.885 line:80%
And thinking about baby names beforehand
is a little...

408
00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:11.386 line:80%
It's so significant...

409
00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:20.020 line:80%
You don't know what will happen?

410
00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:34.201 line:80%
Look at us right now.

411
00:41:38.205 --> 00:41:39.206 line:80%
We do this.

412
00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:42.209 line:80%
We do this too.

413
00:41:45.712 --> 00:41:46.755 line:80%
We even do this.

414
00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.466 line:80%
You really don't know?

415
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:52.177 line:80%
Shall I tell you?

416
00:41:53.178 --> 00:41:54.429 line:80%
Shall I teach you?

417
00:41:55.764 --> 00:41:58.016 line:80%
Dad, I'm so happy now.

Marketing Team 1.
Let's go taste the new products.

421
00:42:11.404 --> 00:42:14.532 line:80%
It's not that I've become someone great.

422
00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:17.702 line:80%
I'm still just Kang Ji-won.

423
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:28.838 line:80%
This should be had with beer.

424
00:42:30.215 --> 00:42:31.424 line:80%
It's good.

425
00:42:31.508 --> 00:42:34.135 line:80%
This is salty and spicy.

426
00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:37.222 line:80%
I think it'll be good
with
makgeolli
. Right?

427
00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:38.723 line:80%
-Yeah.
-Right?

428
00:42:38.807 --> 00:42:41.393 line:80%
I think we can use storytelling

429
00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:43.979 line:80%
as the marketing point for this product.

430
00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:47.565 line:80%
The story of the sisters who developed it
is interesting.

431
00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:53.655 line:80%
I'll look into it.

432
00:42:59.953 --> 00:43:01.496 line:80%
This is delicious.

433
00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:03.415 line:80%
Aren't we working right now?

434
00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:09.004 line:80%
But Ms. Yang told me to bring beer.

435
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:19.431 line:80%
Ms. Kang.

436
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.141 line:80%
I...

437
00:43:24.227 --> 00:43:26.354 line:80%
Thanks for entrusting me with the snack.

438
00:43:28.023 --> 00:43:29.691 line:80%
You work hard lately.

439
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.276 line:80%
No, wait.

440
00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:36.281 line:80%
About the meal kit project...

441
00:43:37.324 --> 00:43:39.534 line:80%
I interfered in the middle and...

442
00:43:43.163 --> 00:43:44.622 line:80%
I wanted to say sorry.

443
00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:47.959 line:80%
I knew.

444
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:52.714 line:80%
But we gained better results from it,
so I decided to let it go.

445
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:59.095 line:80%
But you're incredible.
I didn't think you'd admit to it.

446
00:43:59.846 --> 00:44:01.473 line:80%
I misjudged you.

447
00:44:02.766 --> 00:44:04.267 line:80%
When it comes to people,

448
00:44:05.518 --> 00:44:07.687 line:80%
they change for sure with age.

449
00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:12.859 line:80%
I believed in love, but it failed me.

450
00:44:14.027 --> 00:44:16.029 line:80%
After everything that happened,

451
00:44:17.322 --> 00:44:18.865 line:80%
I reflected on myself...

452
00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:24.662 line:80%
I pondered who I was as a person,

453
00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:27.582 line:80%
and figured it out.

454
00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:30.794 line:80%
Mr. Kim. Shall we go to your seat?

455
00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:32.045 line:80%
-Shall we?
-Sure.

456
00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:34.005 line:80%
Shall we smoke first?

457
00:44:34.089 --> 00:44:36.549 line:80%
But a lot of things have changed.

458
00:44:37.634 --> 00:44:39.969 line:80%
Here we go.

459
00:44:40.053 --> 00:44:41.388 line:80%
It's hot.

460
00:44:43.807 --> 00:44:45.725 line:80%
-Thank you for the meal!
-Wait.

461
00:44:50.647 --> 00:44:52.857 line:80%
You need to add a lot of
jeongguji.

462
00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.778 line:80%
Well?

463
00:44:57.737 --> 00:45:00.407 line:80%
You don't know how to eat pork
gukbap
.

464
00:45:03.827 --> 00:45:04.828 line:80%
I'll try it.

465
00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:17.924 line:80%
I know this taste.

466
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:24.347 line:80%
Is this from the restaurant we went to?

467
00:45:25.682 --> 00:45:27.976 line:80%
Nothing gets past your tastebuds.

468
00:45:29.394 --> 00:45:31.187 line:80%
After the restaurant was gone,

469
00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:34.399 line:80%
I looked for restaurants
that made it like them.

470
00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:36.985 line:80%
I couldn't find anything similar.

471
00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:40.905 line:80%
I was like, "It's Busan!
Why can't these restaurants make it?"

472
00:45:44.325 --> 00:45:46.369 line:80%
"Why are they all different?" And...

473
00:45:49.372 --> 00:45:53.835 line:80%
You don't have to gobble it up.
You can eat it whenever you want now.

474
00:45:56.796 --> 00:46:00.758 line:80%
They opened a branch in Seoul.
Just five minutes from here.

475
00:46:05.847 --> 00:46:06.764 line:80%
No way...

476
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:12.562 line:80%
I thought of stopping the redevelopment.
But this method was much easier.

477
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:15.273 line:80%
That's okay, right?

478
00:46:20.653 --> 00:46:22.155 line:80%
Aren't you so impressed?

479
00:46:22.906 --> 00:46:26.451 line:80%
No, I was thinking about telling you
what I want to eat next.

480
00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:27.535 line:80%
What?

481
00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:29.496 line:80%
I was just kidding.

482
00:46:29.579 --> 00:46:32.165 line:80%
Thank you so much.

483
00:46:32.248 --> 00:46:33.541 line:80%
Eat slowly.

484
00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:35.084 line:80%
I'll eat it every day.

485
00:46:35.627 --> 00:46:36.836 line:80%
It's so good.

486
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.465 line:80%
Right, Ji-hyuk.

487
00:46:41.424 --> 00:46:43.343 line:80%
What are you doing this weekend?

488
00:46:44.511 --> 00:46:46.596 line:80%
I want to go somewhere with you.

489
00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:18.002 line:80%
When I was young,
I always felt anxious and lonely.

490
00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.381 line:80%
But...

491
00:47:23.216 --> 00:47:27.095 line:80%
I'm not anxious or lonely anymore.

492
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:33.268 line:80%
Since I have you beside me.

493
00:47:36.396 --> 00:47:38.356 line:80%
It's no surprise.

494
00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:41.442 line:80%
I'm the best allowance your dad picked
to give you.

495
00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:49.742 line:80%
This...

496
00:47:51.578 --> 00:47:53.705 line:80%
is where we started.

497
00:47:58.042 --> 00:48:00.545 line:80%
I want to start our new start here too.

498
00:48:10.346 --> 00:48:11.347 line:80%
Ji-hyuk.

499
00:48:16.352 --> 00:48:19.772 line:80%
Will you marry me?

500
00:48:35.705 --> 00:48:37.165 line:80%
I can't believe you.

501
00:48:44.881 --> 00:48:46.090 line:80%
No, I mean...

502
00:48:47.467 --> 00:48:50.053 line:80%
That's just how I feel now.

503
00:48:50.136 --> 00:48:53.640 line:80%
You don't have to give me an answer now.

504
00:48:53.723 --> 00:48:56.601 line:80%
How could you just leave like that?

505
00:48:56.684 --> 00:49:01.606 line:80%
I thought everything was back,
but he's still himself.

506
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:11.949 line:80%
You can do whatever you want

507
00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:14.577 line:80%
but not a proposal.

508
00:49:34.055 --> 00:49:36.057 line:80%
I've been carrying it for so long.

509
00:49:39.143 --> 00:49:41.521 line:80%
I wanted to propose all this time.

510
00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:55.326 line:80%
Wil you...

511
00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:01.416 line:80%
marry me?

512
00:50:49.672 --> 00:50:53.050 line:80%
Of course,
there are things that didn't change.

513
00:50:53.134 --> 00:50:55.303 line:80%
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION OF HOPE

514
00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:57.096 line:80%
I don't know why.

515
00:50:59.724 --> 00:51:01.434 line:80%
Why Ji-won wants

516
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:07.064 line:80%
to take everything I have.
Why she wants me to be miserable.

517
00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:09.776 line:80%
It's because you're too nice.

518
00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:13.529 line:80%
People like her only go after nice people.

519
00:51:13.613 --> 00:51:14.864 line:80%
You have to nip them

520
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:16.824 line:80%
in the bud.

521
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:20.244 line:80%
How could a person do that?

522
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:24.248 line:80%
I could endure all of that.

523
00:51:24.916 --> 00:51:25.917 line:80%
However...

524
00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:29.796 line:80%
Do you remember

525
00:51:32.006 --> 00:51:35.301 line:80%
when I told you
about Ji-won being delusional?

526
00:51:36.427 --> 00:51:38.971 line:80%
She kept saying I was gaslighting her.

527
00:51:39.055 --> 00:51:42.183 line:80%
That I was harassing her
and ruining her life.

528
00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:44.310 line:80%
She acted like a victim,

529
00:51:44.393 --> 00:51:46.479 line:80%
and that's why I ended up here.

530
00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:49.565 line:80%
Goodness, not only is she crazy,

531
00:51:49.649 --> 00:51:51.567 line:80%
she's also so pathetic.

532
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:53.611 line:80%
I know, right?

533
00:51:54.821 --> 00:51:56.364 line:80%
But what can I do?

534
00:51:56.447 --> 00:51:59.325 line:80%
I'm her only friend.

535
00:51:59.408 --> 00:52:01.410 line:80%
I'll talk to her when I get out.

536
00:52:06.791 --> 00:52:08.209 line:80%
Inmate 2574, visitor.

537
00:52:14.674 --> 00:52:16.217 line:80%
Why are you so surprised?

538
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.641 line:80%
You...

539
00:52:31.232 --> 00:52:32.817 line:80%
You didn't die?

540
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.611 line:80%
I did. That's why I'm here.

541
00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:40.992 line:80%
One billion won.

542
00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:46.205 line:80%
Now that I'm dead, the benefit
of one billion won will be paid.

543
00:52:49.625 --> 00:52:50.835 line:80%
Can you...

544
00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:54.088 line:80%
give this to Ji-won?

545
00:52:57.592 --> 00:52:58.634 line:80%
What?

546
00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:03.598 line:80%
No.

547
00:53:04.432 --> 00:53:06.058 line:80%
Why is it Ji-won again?

548
00:53:06.142 --> 00:53:08.644 line:80%
-I'll kill her!
-
Executive Director Yu Ji-hyuk,

549
00:53:08.728 --> 00:53:11.105 line:80%
the grandson of U&K Group's Chairman Yu,

550
00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:14.358 line:80%
-is getting married at Winton Hotel.
-I only had Ji-won!

551
00:53:14.442 --> 00:53:16.444 line:80%
She felt the same!

552
00:53:16.527 --> 00:53:19.447 line:80%
I only had Ji-won!

553
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:20.740 line:80%
Quiet!

554
00:53:21.449 --> 00:53:23.701 line:80%
Ma'am, please let me go! Please!

555
00:53:24.285 --> 00:53:26.162 line:80%
Let me out of here! Please!

556
00:53:28.915 --> 00:53:30.499 line:80%
Ji-won can't be happy.

557
00:53:31.083 --> 00:53:34.712 line:80%
She can't be happy without me!

558
00:53:34.795 --> 00:53:36.339 line:80%
She can't!

559
00:53:48.768 --> 00:53:51.145 line:80%
WEDDING
YU JI-HYUK, KANG JI-WON

560
00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.854 line:80%
Here come the bride and groom.

561
00:56:27.927 --> 00:56:30.137 line:80%
Everything got a little better.

562
00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:32.681 line:80%
I believe that.

563
00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:11.595 line:80%
I wish you were here.

564
00:57:14.014 --> 00:57:18.352 line:80%
You would be so happy
to see me this happy.

565
00:57:22.731 --> 00:57:24.650 line:80%
Hey. You all came too.

566
00:57:25.693 --> 00:57:28.070 line:80%
No, we didn't come.

567
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:32.449 line:80%
I paid a lot for her congratulatory gift.

568
00:57:32.533 --> 00:57:33.909 line:80%
I applauded a lot too.

569
00:57:34.743 --> 00:57:36.287 line:80%
But I didn't eat anything.

570
00:57:41.167 --> 00:57:44.253 line:80%
The more I think about it,
the sorrier I feel.

571
00:57:44.336 --> 00:57:46.589 line:80%
And I truly hope she's happy.

572
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:51.594 line:80%
But that's the only thing I can do.

573
00:57:52.136 --> 00:57:53.470 line:80%
You truly regret it.

574
00:57:56.932 --> 00:57:59.268 line:80%
One, two, three.

575
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:02.021 line:80%
Dad, are you watching?

576
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.984 line:80%
Let's go!

577
00:58:11.405 --> 00:58:13.949 line:80%
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

578
00:58:32.676 --> 00:58:36.597 line:80%
APRIL 2016

579
00:58:42.061 --> 00:58:47.942 line:80%
Hello, I'm Kang Ji-won, the director
of U&K's Second Chance Foundation.

580
00:58:50.653 --> 00:58:53.697 line:80%
Our foundation's planning
to gradually contribute

581
00:58:53.781 --> 00:58:57.785 line:80%
20 billion won through
major affiliated companies by next year.

582
00:58:58.744 --> 00:58:59.912 line:80%
From there,

583
00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:04.667 line:80%
U&K plans to initiate systematic
and continuous donations to the society

584
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:08.379 line:80%
as a company that understands
the meaning of sharing.

585
00:59:11.298 --> 00:59:15.886 line:80%
Even in moments
when everything seems to be over,

586
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:18.889 line:80%
I believe there's another path.

587
00:59:19.932 --> 00:59:21.934 line:80%
That path could even be better.

588
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:28.023 line:80%
There must be a second chance.

589
00:59:28.107 --> 00:59:30.442 line:80%
No, it must be given.

590
00:59:30.526 --> 00:59:34.321 line:80%
To those suffering
because of one wrong choice they made,

591
00:59:34.405 --> 00:59:38.909 line:80%
I hope our foundation can be of help.

592
00:59:40.786 --> 00:59:41.704 line:80%
Thank you.

593
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:56.635 line:80%
I'm doing well this time, right?

594
00:59:58.554 --> 00:59:59.430 line:80%
But...

595
00:59:59.513 --> 01:00:03.851 line:80%
OCTOBER 2017

596
01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:27.458 line:80%
Do babies really not sleep like this?

597
01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:31.879 line:80%
Ji-won.

598
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.049 line:80%
Seeing the baby cry like this,

599
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:38.302 line:80%
I think he's sick.
Let's take him to the hospital.

600
01:00:39.178 --> 01:00:40.220 line:80%
Let me see.

601
01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.268 line:80%
He's fine.

602
01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:52.149 line:80%
He pooped.

603
01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.202 line:80%
-Number two.
-He pooped a lot.

604
01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.203 line:80%
Hurry.

605
01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.667 line:80%
Why won't you sleep?

606
01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:13.587 line:80%
Did you poop?

607
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.215 line:80%
Daddy will change your diaper.

608
01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:19.635 line:80%
I've never done this before,
so it's not easy.

609
01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:21.804 line:80%
But I think I'm doing a good job.

610
01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:43.117 line:80%
I am definitely moving forward
little by little now.

611
01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:50.249 line:80%
I'm not walking in place.
I'm walking forward.

612
01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:58.757 line:80%
I want to be land.

613
01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:01.051 line:80%
I want to be land.

614
01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:04.430 line:80%
-What are they saying?
-What? Land? Lamb?

615
01:02:05.514 --> 01:02:07.891 line:80%
But why does it sound familiar?

616
01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:10.018 line:80%
Where are our mom and dad?

617
01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:14.398 line:80%
I don't know.
They said it was their anniversary.

618
01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:17.067 line:80%
A super important
and once-only anniversary.

619
01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:19.570 line:80%
Grandfather.

620
01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.450 line:80%
So you can play with your aunt!

621
01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:31.206 line:80%
Come here!

622
01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:32.833 line:80%
This way!

623
01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:35.752 line:80%
Grandfather, save us!

624
01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:36.962 line:80%
Help us!

625
01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:39.965 line:80%
OUR FAMILY MOTTO:
BECOME EACH OTHER'S STURDY LAND!

626
01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:41.467 line:80%
I WANT TO BE LAND!

627
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:48.015 line:80%
APRIL 12, 2023

628
01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:04.490 line:80%
And today is the day that all the seasons
I have spent before ended.

629
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:11.121 line:80%
I can't believe I can spend
the same season so differently like this.

630
01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.799 line:80%
This is the middle of spring.

631
01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.305 line:80%
It's beautiful.

632
01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:32.100 line:80%
I've always liked this artist.

633
01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:35.103 line:80%
But I think the painting style
has changed a bit.

634
01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:39.650 line:80%
The painter worked so hard
until the work was acknowledged.

635
01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:44.613 line:80%
Thanks to our foundation,
the painter could work at ease.

636
01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.033 line:80%
It's back to normal now.

637
01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.994 line:80%
This was how it should've been.

638
01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:56.291 line:80%
It could've been this beautiful.

639
01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:02.297 line:80%
I'm living properly now, Dad.

640
01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:11.348 line:80%
Thank you.

641
01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:17.437 line:80%
For making April 12, 2023

642
01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:21.191 line:80%
a completely different day.

643
01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:28.907 line:80%
Thank you...
