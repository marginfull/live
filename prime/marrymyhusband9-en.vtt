-Happy birthday to you!
-Happy birthday to you!

2
00:00:44.587 --> 00:00:48.299 line:80%
I wondered why you'd have
such a fancy birthday party.

3
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.342 line:80%
Was it to propose?

4
00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:54.180 line:80%
I hope today will be the best gift
of her life.

5
00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.264 line:80%
How was it?

6
00:00:57.183 --> 00:00:58.893 line:80%
You're so lucky!

7
00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.562 line:80%
This is amazing.

8
00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.731 line:80%
How did you come up with this?

9
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.655 line:80%
I was a little surprised
by the drones and fireworks too.

10
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.160 line:80%
Well, you know. I'd do anything.

11
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:22.958 line:80%
You know, I would've still been happy
with a cheaper event.

12
00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:23.876 line:80%
Thanks.

PROPOSAL DECORATION

16
00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:34.720 line:80%
It's 39,000 won?

17
00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.391 line:80%
This is 50,000 won? This is insane!

18
00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:41.310 line:80%
Oh, hello.

19
00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:49.819 line:80%
The company will provide a villa
for Ms. Kang's birthday

20
00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:52.696 line:80%
to offer consolation
for what happened recently.

21
00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:54.365 line:80%
Consolation?

22
00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.033 line:80%
For what Mr. Kim did.

23
00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.701 line:80%
Oh, right.

24
00:01:58.953 --> 00:01:59.995 line:80%
It's for that.

25
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.998 line:80%
But a villa for consolation?

26
00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:07.503 line:80%
Normally, a condo,
but they're more generous this time.

27
00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:10.422 line:80%
He's really in love with her.

28
00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:12.842 line:80%
It's true love!

29
00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.678 line:80%
But too bad. You clearly don't know women.

30
00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:17.638 line:80%
Ji-won only loves me.

31
00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:23.102 line:80%
Don't grab like that! You're crazy!

32
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.856 line:80%
I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:29.817 line:80%
This is a great opportunity.

34
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.070 line:80%
Why don't we have the party
with everyone on our team?

35
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.658 line:80%
She thought it was a birthday party,
but surprise!

36
00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:41.579 line:80%
I'm going to propose to her.

37
00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:46.959 line:80%
I'm going to marry Kang Ji-won.

38
00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:52.631 line:80%
Come and get your heart broken, punk!

39
00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:54.383 line:80%
I hate your guts!

40
00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.594 line:80%
You'll come too, right?

41
00:02:58.095 --> 00:02:59.346 line:80%
Of course.

42
00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:01.765 line:80%
I can provide other support too.

43
00:03:07.146 --> 00:03:08.898 line:80%
Well...

44
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.586 line:80%
Congrats.

45
00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:38.093 line:80%
Have you...

46
00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:40.971 line:80%
still not forgiven me?

47
00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.105 line:80%
Ji-won, I'm sorry. Stop being mad at me.

48
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.524 line:80%
Please?

49
00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:53.817 line:80%
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:57.905 line:80%
Don't be mad.

51
00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:01.700 line:80%
Let's go back
to being good friends. Please, Ji-won?

52
00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:12.252 line:80%
I can't figure you out.

53
00:04:14.964 --> 00:04:16.340 line:80%
But what's important is

54
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.968 line:80%
that I don't really want to.

55
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.098 line:80%
Bye.

56
00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:25.766 line:80%
Ji-won...

57
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:33.732 line:80%
Kang Ji-won!

58
00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.920 line:80%
You know I can't swim.

59
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.346 line:80%
Guess what they say then?

60
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.723 line:80%
What?

61
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.182 line:80%
Carbonara.

62
00:06:10.454 --> 00:06:11.705 line:80%
Ji-won.

63
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:35.604 line:80%
Are you cold?

64
00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.900 line:80%
Are you okay?

65
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:41.902 line:80%
I'm fine.

66
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.781 line:80%
Su-min's sleeping.
She must've been surprised.

67
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.618 line:80%
What a relief. It could've been bad.

68
00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:52.996 line:80%
How did she fall in?

69
00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.834 line:80%
She didn't jump in, did she?

70
00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.294 line:80%
She slipped.

71
00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:00.712 line:80%
She seemed drunk.

72
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.048 line:80%
Really?

73
00:07:03.132 --> 00:07:05.425 line:80%
I'm glad no one's hurt.

74
00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.304 line:80%
Su-min should be grateful to you
for the rest of her life.

75
00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:10.681 line:80%
You're her savior.

76
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:14.351 line:80%
Thankfully, there's some hot cocoa.

77
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.103 line:80%
It's hot.

78
00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:20.816 line:80%
Yeah, drink that.

79
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.860 line:80%
Let's bring your temperature up.

80
00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.613 line:80%
I bet you'll have a good life.

81
00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:29.908 line:80%
The more accidents,
the more to reminisce about.

82
00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.036 line:80%
The proposal was nice!

83
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.038 line:80%
Of course.

84
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.418 line:80%
-Shall we clean up?
-What?

85
00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.796 line:80%
But it's only 11.

86
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:47.426 line:80%
We need to talk and drink more.
The night's still young.

87
00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:50.929 line:80%
I'm pretty shook up, so I'm tired too.

88
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.890 line:80%
Let's all rest.

89
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.683 line:80%
Thanks for tonight.

90
00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:55.851 line:80%
Let's go.

91
00:07:57.895 --> 00:07:59.104 line:80%
Shall we go up too?

92
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.691 line:80%
Go ahead. I'll go after I drink this.

93
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:05.611 line:80%
Yeah, sure.

94
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.675 line:80%
That was a textbook proposal.
It went great.

95
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.346 line:80%
I could never do it again. No way!

96
00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:35.307 line:80%
Oh, my God! What the hell?

97
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.433 line:80%
What?

98
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.897 line:80%
You're quite late.

99
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.068 line:80%
What are you doing here?

100
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.781 line:80%
Get in here.

101
00:08:55.661 --> 00:08:57.829 line:80%
I proposed today.

102
00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:00.290 line:80%
And Ji-won's in the next room.

103
00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.044 line:80%
That makes it more thrilling.

104
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:06.630 line:80%
You don't want to?

105
00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:10.676 line:80%
Are you drunk?

106
00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.470 line:80%
You look really happy.

107
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.434 line:80%
Ji-won...

108
00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.729 line:80%
jumped in the water for me.

109
00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:36.285 line:80%
Now...

110
00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:40.330 line:80%
it's your turn to make me happy.

111
00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.338 line:80%
Come on.

112
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.856 line:80%
Are you okay?

113
00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.700 line:80%
She jumped in.

114
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.910 line:80%
She didn't slip.

115
00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:21.663 line:80%
She jumped in.

116
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.623 line:80%
Right in front of me.

117
00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:33.800 line:80%
Maybe I didn't know Su-min at all.

118
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.850 line:80%
I thought it'd be easy.

119
00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:45.979 line:80%
That Min-hwan is trash
and Su-min covets my things,

120
00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:48.940 line:80%
so I just need them to marry
to become happy.

121
00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:53.695 line:80%
But I was wrong.

122
00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:00.619 line:80%
She dragged me down.

123
00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:04.706 line:80%
She grabbed my arm
and dragged me down deeper.

124
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.459 line:80%
Also...

125
00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:10.921 line:80%
she was smiling.

126
00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:18.595 line:80%
Did I imagine it?

127
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.555 line:80%
I wish that were true.

128
00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:22.808 line:80%
But no.

129
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.353 line:80%
She tried to die for real.

130
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:33.193 line:80%
As if dying in the water was nothing

131
00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:36.947 line:80%
and she didn't care about anything
as long as I died with her.

132
00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:49.019 line:80%
I want to show you something.

133
00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:12.375 line:80%
When I felt confused
and unsure of what I was doing,

134
00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:14.961 line:80%
I always came here.

135
00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.258 line:80%
Once I cleared my head here,

136
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.428 line:80%
I felt I could take another step.

137
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.186 line:80%
No one knows the future.

138
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.314 line:80%
However,

139
00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:38.276 line:80%
we know more than other people.

140
00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.032 line:80%
So don't be scared.

141
00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.743 line:80%
You've gotten so much better.

142
00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:50.121 line:80%
You learned something new
about a friend of 26 years.

143
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.962 line:80%
If Su-min showed you a side
she never had before,

144
00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:01.800 line:80%
it means you're not an easy target
to her anymore.

145
00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.645 line:80%
I truly wish you a happy birthday.

146
00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.824 line:80%
Thanks for the proposal.

147
00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.955 line:80%
It was the best first birthday.

148
00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:54.686 line:80%
EPISODE 9

149
00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.362 line:80%
Ms. Kang!

150
00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.239 line:80%
-Hello.
-Hello.

151
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.868 line:80%
Oh, my. What's that?

152
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.244 line:80%
Ms. Kang, no way!

153
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:15.290 line:80%
I'm engaged!

154
00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:17.208 line:80%
Wow! Is that a carat?

155
00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:20.629 line:80%
Wow, Mr. Park really did it.

156
00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:22.088 line:80%
It's so pretty.

157
00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:23.757 line:80%
I'm so jealous.

158
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.884 line:80%
-It looks good on her.
-Yeah.

159
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:09.010 line:80%
Why tell everyone if you'll call it off?

160
00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.638 line:80%
Because I'm going to call it off.

161
00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:15.600 line:80%
Park Min-hwan's life
will take a bigger hit

162
00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.602 line:80%
once everything's revealed.

163
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.315 line:80%
You know, I've gotten a lot better.

164
00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.985 line:80%
What are you doing this weekend?

165
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:28.029 line:80%
Come to Yuhan Department Store.

166
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.992 line:80%
I'm going to milk him
for the first and last time.

167
00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:37.122 line:80%
It's a shame I have a trip to Japan.

168
00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:41.292 line:80%
You're going to miss out
on a big spectacle.

169
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:43.294 line:80%
Min-hwan's face will be a sight.

170
00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.089 line:80%
I'll be rooting for you.

171
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.223 line:80%
The family can meet on the weekend.

172
00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:59.769 line:80%
My mom has a cooking class
at the cultural center. There's no time.

173
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.731 line:80%
Are you eating something nice? Buy me too.

174
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.525 line:80%
Goodness.

175
00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:07.527 line:80%
You're so greedy, aren't you?

176
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.654 line:80%
-I want...
-My God!

177
00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.324 line:80%
It's the printer.

178
00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.827 line:80%
It must be jealous.

179
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.038 line:80%
Are you two planning another surprise?

180
00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:21.750 line:80%
I'm so jealous of Ms. Kang.

181
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.336 line:80%
It's the least they can do.

182
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.505 line:80%
Only the family dinner's left now.

183
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.967 line:80%
You'll do something legendary again,
right, Mr. Park?

184
00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:33.845 line:80%
Even I can't wait.

185
00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.306 line:80%
Right.

186
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.351 line:80%
I didn't know Min-hwan had
this side to him.

187
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:43.521 line:80%
My expectations are so high now.

188
00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.524 line:80%
They are?

189
00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:49.986 line:80%
What do you mean by expectations?

190
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.070 line:80%
Come on.

191
00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:55.784 line:80%
Good men buy women clothes, shoes,
and bags before the family dinner, right?

192
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.871 line:80%
Wait, women run away
if you buy them shoes.

193
00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.081 line:80%
The best friend can buy them!

194
00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.504 line:80%
Oh, is that a thing?

195
00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.589 line:80%
So nice! I'll spread the word.

196
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:17.514 line:80%
Yeah, sure.

197
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.520 line:80%
What to sell second hand...

198
00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:30.401 line:80%
Just the frame.
I'll toss the rest. They're too old.

199
00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:32.737 line:80%
And the...

200
00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:34.697 line:80%
Who's that?

201
00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.334 line:80%
Ji-won.

202
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:50.296 line:80%
I'll just give you this and leave.

203
00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.007 line:80%
Your birthday present.

204
00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:06.938 line:80%
These.

205
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.026 line:80%
Aren't they pretty? Buy them for me.

206
00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:13.987 line:80%
As my birthday present.

207
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.372 line:80%
Well...

208
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.374 line:80%
And...

209
00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:33.006 line:80%
I want to give you something else
as a wedding present.

210
00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.008 line:80%
Is that okay?

211
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:42.682 line:80%
You're getting married,
and you can't cook.

212
00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:49.188 line:80%
I heard Yuhan Department Store Cultural
Center has a good weekend cooking class.

213
00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.858 line:80%
I'll pay for it.

214
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:54.527 line:80%
Let's take the class together.

215
00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:01.868 line:80%
Yuhan Mall's cooking class?

216
00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.830 line:80%
Make it just like this.

217
00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:13.546 line:80%
YUHAN DEPARTMENT STORE CULTURAL CENTER
SPECIAL COOKING CLASS

218
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.715 line:80%
The class Kim Ja-ok was taking.

219
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.136 line:80%
This never happened before.

220
00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:23.890 line:80%
I'm sure Su-min's evolving
because I've changed my attitude.

221
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.312 line:80%
You don't like it?

222
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:32.815 line:80%
That's not it.

223
00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:33.858 line:80%
Thank you.

224
00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.446 line:80%
I'm more grateful.

225
00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:41.699 line:80%
Ji-won.

226
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:46.579 line:80%
I'm really sorry.

227
00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:52.251 line:80%
Thanks for the chance.
I won't disappoint you.

228
00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:59.217 line:80%
I'm going to become your real other half.
Someone you can really rely on.

229
00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.953 line:80%
I must have no talent for acting.

230
00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:29.247 line:80%
Because it's so hard

231
00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:33.668 line:80%
to pretend to be biting it
when I know it's bait.

232
00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:03.489 line:80%
This is great.

233
00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:08.745 line:80%
If the bad guys weren't bad enough,
I'd be hesitant to take revenge.

234
00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:15.543 line:80%
But they just won't give up
and continue to be so persistently bad.

235
00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:17.128 line:80%
Thanks.

236
00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:20.298 line:80%
Thank you so much.

237
00:22:37.732 --> 00:22:40.735 line:80%
YUHAN DEPARTMENT STORE CULTURAL CENTER
COOKING CLASS

238
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:46.199 line:80%
I had to pay for parking last week.

239
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.826 line:80%
I've been coming here for years.

240
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.245 line:80%
That's not possible.

241
00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:53.039 line:80%
Your name and plate number?

242
00:22:53.122 --> 00:22:56.459 line:80%
Kim Ja-ok, 5780.

243
00:22:57.126 --> 00:23:01.881 line:80%
Ma'am, you parked
for over six hours last week.

244
00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:04.634 line:80%
We only provide two hours for the class.

245
00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:07.178 line:80%
-It's our policy that you must buy...
-No.

246
00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:11.182 line:80%
It's just a tiny parking spot,
but you make me pay?

247
00:23:11.265 --> 00:23:12.975 line:80%
I've never once paid!

248
00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:15.228 line:80%
Why are you making me pay now?

249
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:21.400 line:80%
This is my spot.

250
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:24.529 line:80%
Goodness.

251
00:23:24.612 --> 00:23:28.574 line:80%
Everyone pays for this class.
How are there assigned seats?

252
00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.619 line:80%
Look at this young lady.

253
00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:33.412 line:80%
I'm an adult, and I said so.

254
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:36.415 line:80%
Move out of the way. Go over there!

255
00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:40.044 line:80%
I'm sorry. Let's just do what she says.

256
00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:42.296 line:80%
-We'll go.
-Don't say sorry.

257
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.756 line:80%
Nothing's set here.

258
00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:48.094 line:80%
That girl knows a thing or two.

259
00:23:48.177 --> 00:23:52.014 line:80%
I swear, there will always
be rude, ill-mannered people.

260
00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:54.058 line:80%
They're everywhere.

261
00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:09.365 line:80%
I called and checked the quantity.

262
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:13.327 line:80%
And the Jomart tasting evaluation.
There it is.

263
00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:16.289 line:80%
And the proposal for promotion.
Where is it?

264
00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:19.417 line:80%
Farm assessment form.

265
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:22.253 line:80%
Oh, no.

266
00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:28.176 line:80%
I'm really busy...

267
00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:29.594 line:80%
Mommy.

268
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:31.971 line:80%
Yeon-ji?

269
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:35.850 line:80%
Mommy, it's Sunday. Where are you?

270
00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:37.894 line:80%
I'm hungry.

271
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:41.022 line:80%
How did you call me?

272
00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:43.316 line:80%
Where's your daddy? Where is he?

273
00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:46.235 line:80%
Daddy? He's busy.

274
00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:48.988 line:80%
I'm hungry. When are you coming home?

275
00:24:50.072 --> 00:24:51.991 line:80%
Why is your daddy busy?

276
00:24:52.074 --> 00:24:54.911 line:80%
Is he not home? Where is he?

277
00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:11.802 line:80%
Sir, can you drive faster?

278
00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:15.097 line:80%
My five-year-old daughter
is home alone right now.

279
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:17.058 line:80%
I'm sorry to hear that,

280
00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:20.645 line:80%
but I can't clear this weekend traffic.

281
00:25:25.775 --> 00:25:27.443 line:80%
This is insane.

282
00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:29.487 line:80%
YEON-JI'S DAD

283
00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:34.367 line:80%
Mommy!

284
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.077 line:80%
-Yeon-ji!
-
Mommy!

285
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.622 line:80%
It's me. This is a video call.
Put it down and look at me.

286
00:25:39.705 --> 00:25:42.124 line:80%
-
Mommy!
-Don't cry. Look at me.

287
00:25:44.252 --> 00:25:46.837 line:80%
Mommy!

288
00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:19.662 line:80%
Yeon-ji, I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just wait.

289
00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:26.377 line:80%
Mr. Lee!

290
00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:30.298 line:80%
Please help me.

291
00:27:00.286 --> 00:27:02.330 line:80%
Here. Thank you.

292
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:05.082 line:80%
Sir, thank you so much.

293
00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:06.667 line:80%
Thank you.

294
00:27:15.718 --> 00:27:16.969 line:80%
Where did you go?

295
00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:19.805 line:80%
I had some work to do.

296
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.224 line:80%
Do I play all day?

297
00:27:22.725 --> 00:27:23.893 line:80%
It's the weekend.

298
00:27:25.311 --> 00:27:26.187 line:80%
Noodles...

299
00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:31.442 line:80%
How could you feed her instant noodles?

300
00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:32.735 line:80%
Don't eat that.

301
00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:34.320 line:80%
So dramatic.

302
00:27:35.446 --> 00:27:36.697 line:80%
You feed her then.

303
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:40.326 line:80%
Are you okay?

304
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:42.036 line:80%
-Mommy.
-Yeah?

305
00:27:45.247 --> 00:27:48.292 line:80%
Why go to work on the weekend
to come back so early?

306
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.533 line:80%
Your hands are quick and neat
for a young lady.

307
00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:23.244 line:80%
I love to cook.

308
00:28:30.793 --> 00:28:32.378 line:80%
But as for you...

309
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:36.549 line:80%
How will she cook for her family
if she's that slow?

310
00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:39.844 line:80%
They won't eat tomorrow at that speed.

311
00:28:39.927 --> 00:28:42.054 line:80%
Maybe breakfast in two days?

312
00:28:42.138 --> 00:28:43.973 line:80%
No, lunch in two days.

313
00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:45.474 line:80%
What?

314
00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:47.393 line:80%
What was that?

315
00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:51.647 line:80%
My boyfriend loves cooking,
so he'll cook for me for the two days.

316
00:28:56.318 --> 00:28:59.989 line:80%
Men weren't even allowed in the kitchen
back in the day.

317
00:29:01.574 --> 00:29:02.950 line:80%
It's not that day now.

318
00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:06.704 line:80%
I'm happy with now.

319
00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:09.623 line:80%
What's your problem?

320
00:29:09.707 --> 00:29:14.628 line:80%
It's obvious what kind of family
she'll marry into.

321
00:29:17.047 --> 00:29:18.382 line:80%
-Ja-ok?
-Goodness!

322
00:29:18.466 --> 00:29:19.508 line:80%
Are you done?

323
00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:20.926 line:80%
Hello!

324
00:29:23.262 --> 00:29:25.598 line:80%
Why is she so annoying?

325
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:32.771 line:80%
Sir, women who can't even cook

326
00:29:32.855 --> 00:29:36.525 line:80%
are signing up for this class
to try and seduce a man.

327
00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:39.487 line:80%
You have to be careful of them.

328
00:29:40.154 --> 00:29:42.364 line:80%
Yeah, I understand.

329
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.205 line:80%
Goodness, Ji-won!

330
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:51.457 line:80%
How did you make it so pretty?

331
00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:54.585 line:80%
Wow! That's amazing. You're the best.

332
00:29:55.586 --> 00:29:56.462 line:80%
Great job.

333
00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:03.344 line:80%
I was bad at cooking
around this time. But...

334
00:30:16.357 --> 00:30:17.983 line:80%
Peel that pear.

335
00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:19.818 line:80%
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:27.493 line:80%
Not so thick. Thinner.

337
00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:28.536 line:80%
Okay.

338
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:33.040 line:80%
Thanks for the hard training.

339
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:36.919 line:80%
I love her cooking skills.

340
00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:39.964 line:80%
How could someone so rude...

341
00:30:42.716 --> 00:30:44.510 line:80%
Food shouldn't just look good.

342
00:30:44.593 --> 00:30:48.097 line:80%
It's hard to make good carrot
râpées.

343
00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:51.892 line:80%
This taste...

344
00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:00.317 line:80%
It's the same as the teacher's.

345
00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:04.488 line:80%
Because you learned it here
and taught it to me, Ms. Kim.

346
00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:11.662 line:80%
I'm glad you think it's good.

347
00:31:22.673 --> 00:31:24.466 line:80%
When did you learn to cook?

348
00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:27.928 line:80%
I didn't learn. I just did it.

349
00:31:28.596 --> 00:31:31.140 line:80%
I wanted to make it pretty,
so I went slow.

350
00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:36.353 line:80%
I learned what carrot
râpées
were today.

351
00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:40.816 line:80%
Well, my dad taught it to me long ago.

352
00:31:42.735 --> 00:31:44.403 line:80%
Your dad...

353
00:31:44.486 --> 00:31:45.863 line:80%
He was a great person.

354
00:31:46.655 --> 00:31:48.866 line:80%
-Enjoy.
-Thank you. Let's go.

355
00:31:48.949 --> 00:31:50.743 line:80%
Let's go do some shopping.

356
00:31:51.827 --> 00:31:52.911 line:80%
Min-hwan!

357
00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:00.919 line:80%
He's buying me clothes
for the family dinner.

358
00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:03.255 line:80%
Want to join us?

359
00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:10.429 line:80%
But...

360
00:32:11.722 --> 00:32:14.016 line:80%
I didn't know Su-min...

361
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:17.269 line:80%
would be here.

362
00:32:23.317 --> 00:32:27.696 line:80%
Babe, when are we meeting your parents?

363
00:32:28.322 --> 00:32:29.198 line:80%
What?

364
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:35.579 line:80%
Well, we have to set a date.

365
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.373 line:80%
I should go.

366
00:32:40.834 --> 00:32:41.835 line:80%
I have plans.

367
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.633 line:80%
If I knew you were coming,
I wouldn't have made other plans.

368
00:32:48.175 --> 00:32:49.134 line:80%
You have plans?

369
00:32:50.678 --> 00:32:53.972 line:80%
Yeah, let's hang out next time. I'll buy!

370
00:32:54.682 --> 00:32:56.934 line:80%
We did birthday and wedding gifts.

371
00:32:57.017 --> 00:32:58.394 line:80%
Next time,

372
00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:00.354 line:80%
it's a gift for my savior.

373
00:33:02.272 --> 00:33:03.190 line:80%
Yeah, okay.

374
00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:06.235 line:80%
It's a date, then. Just the two of us.

375
00:33:07.236 --> 00:33:08.904 line:80%
Yeah, sounds good.

376
00:33:08.987 --> 00:33:11.073 line:80%
This is nice!

377
00:33:18.122 --> 00:33:21.375 line:80%
I'm really alive because of you.

378
00:33:27.715 --> 00:33:28.549 line:80%
Bye.

379
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:40.936 line:80%
Do you need any duty-free items?

380
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.020 line:80%
That's okay.

381
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.775 line:80%
Do you need any duty-free items?

382
00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:47.860 line:80%
That's fine.

383
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.363 line:80%
Wait a second.

384
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:55.033 line:80%
Do you want to see?

385
00:34:05.127 --> 00:34:07.212 line:80%
Are you saying
he bought the same necklace?

386
00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:10.924 line:80%
No, it's a bit different. This one...

387
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.218 line:80%
It looked quite expensive.

388
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:30.235 line:80%
I want this one.

389
00:34:31.737 --> 00:34:34.156 line:80%
Hey, this is too expensive.

390
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.449 line:80%
Are you newlyweds?

391
00:34:35.532 --> 00:34:37.159 line:80%
The perfect wedding gift.

392
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.870 line:80%
I haven't met her yet,

393
00:34:39.953 --> 00:34:42.831 line:80%
but I hear his mother has high standards.

394
00:34:42.915 --> 00:34:44.333 line:80%
If that's the case,

395
00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:46.043 line:80%
you'll need that bag.

396
00:34:48.378 --> 00:34:49.713 line:80%
It's not just her.

397
00:34:49.797 --> 00:34:52.674 line:80%
We both work at U&K, actually.

398
00:34:52.758 --> 00:34:56.762 line:80%
Everyone's dying to see what he'll buy
for me. Even I feel pressured.

399
00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:01.266 line:80%
Pride controls his body.

400
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.851 line:80%
Yeah, well...

401
00:35:02.935 --> 00:35:04.394 line:80%
I'm a legend at U&K.

402
00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:06.647 line:80%
We'll take it.

403
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.190 line:80%
-Can I?
-Of course.

404
00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:10.442 line:80%
Show us a few more similar ones.

405
00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:17.533 line:80%
This would go well with pink.

406
00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:18.909 line:80%
-With this bag!
-What...

407
00:35:38.762 --> 00:35:41.014 line:80%
How could she buy all of these?

408
00:35:49.273 --> 00:35:52.442 line:80%
Are you going to wear
cheap clothes you bought online again?

409
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.653 line:80%
I told you.

410
00:35:54.736 --> 00:35:56.989 line:80%
My mom has high standards.

411
00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:58.448 line:80%
We can't get married

412
00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:00.492 line:80%
if she doesn't like you.

413
00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:06.248 line:80%
I didn't want to spend his money
when he was struggling.

414
00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:08.375 line:80%
Why did I do that?

415
00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:11.962 line:80%
He would've bought it
for another woman anyway if not me.

416
00:36:12.921 --> 00:36:14.381 line:80%
It was no big deal.

417
00:36:15.132 --> 00:36:16.967 line:80%
Here's your coffee.

418
00:36:17.593 --> 00:36:18.719 line:80%
Thank you.

419
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.890 line:80%
Min-hwan, isn't this beautiful?

420
00:36:22.973 --> 00:36:24.349 line:80%
I love it.

421
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:30.230 line:80%
I finally feel like
I'm up to par with your parents.

422
00:36:31.398 --> 00:36:34.735 line:80%
Getting a family is really great.

423
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.113 line:80%
It's pretty. Yeah.

424
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:40.240 line:80%
They're all pretty. All of them.

425
00:36:40.324 --> 00:36:45.329 line:80%
I realized yet again
that a woman should meet the right man.

426
00:36:46.246 --> 00:36:49.541 line:80%
Of course.
A woman needs to meet the right man.

427
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:56.798 line:80%
We have to have our family meeting now.

428
00:36:57.299 --> 00:36:59.593 line:80%
We have to go somewhere to eat.

429
00:36:59.676 --> 00:37:02.220 line:80%
How shall we pay for the meal?

430
00:37:02.763 --> 00:37:03.680 line:80%
BAEK EUN-HO

431
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.438 line:80%
-Baek Eun-ho?
-Yeah, go on.

432
00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:15.067 line:80%
The one running a restaurant?

433
00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:18.612 line:80%
-No.
-No?

434
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:19.821 line:80%
Wait.

435
00:37:20.405 --> 00:37:21.406 line:80%
Hello?

436
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:26.536 line:80%
Isn't this Ji-won's phone?

437
00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.955 line:80%
Yes, hello.

438
00:37:28.038 --> 00:37:30.165 line:80%
I'm Min-hwan, Ji-won's boyfriend.

439
00:37:33.126 --> 00:37:35.420 line:80%
Yes, hello.

440
00:37:36.713 --> 00:37:38.382 line:80%
I'm Eun-ho, Ji-won's friend.

441
00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:40.676 line:80%
I heard a lot about you.

442
00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:43.679 line:80%
She said you were a great chef.

443
00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:47.391 line:80%
Yeah, thanks.

444
00:37:47.474 --> 00:37:51.603 line:80%
But can I speak with Ji-won right now?

445
00:37:51.687 --> 00:37:53.271 line:80%
That's not important.

446
00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:55.941 line:80%
I heard you ran a fine dining restaurant.

447
00:37:56.024 --> 00:37:57.275 line:80%
What cuisine is it?

448
00:37:57.776 --> 00:38:00.070 line:80%
Is it French or Italian?

449
00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:01.780 line:80%
Or maybe omakase?

450
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:04.741 line:80%
It's a fusion restaurant.

451
00:38:04.825 --> 00:38:06.410 line:80%
French is the base.

452
00:38:06.493 --> 00:38:08.078 line:80%
That's perfect.

453
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:09.746 line:80%
The thing is,

454
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.542 line:80%
Ji-won and I have
an engagement family dinner soon.

455
00:38:15.377 --> 00:38:19.548 line:80%
It'll be meaningful to have it there.
We were just talking about it.

456
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:23.468 line:80%
If you're a friend from school,

457
00:38:23.552 --> 00:38:28.223 line:80%
is there a close friend discount
or an alumni discount?

458
00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:30.225 line:80%
That'd be so nice.

459
00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:33.186 line:80%
I'll call you back.
I look forward to it! Bye.

460
00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:36.606 line:80%
-What are you doing?
-Are you two close?

461
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:45.073 line:80%
What is it? What did he say?

462
00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:46.992 line:80%
Was it her boyfriend?

463
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.830 line:80%
What's wrong? Why? Is she busy?

464
00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:55.876 line:80%
I didn't get to speak with Ji-won.

465
00:38:56.626 --> 00:38:57.794 line:80%
I'll ask later.

466
00:38:57.878 --> 00:38:59.296 line:80%
What did you do?

467
00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:01.298 line:80%
From Ji-won's standpoint,

468
00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:04.217 line:80%
-she may not want an apology.
-You're right.

469
00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:07.054 line:80%
Either way! We should do something.

470
00:39:07.596 --> 00:39:10.682 line:80%
A decent person should make up
for their wrongs.

471
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.102 line:80%
I, Ha Ye-ji, was fooled

472
00:39:14.186 --> 00:39:18.065 line:80%
by Jeong Su-min,
and it was the worst mistake of my life.

473
00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:25.989 line:80%
The date of the dinner
will be early December.

474
00:39:26.073 --> 00:39:27.407 line:80%
I'm counting on you.

475
00:39:28.784 --> 00:39:33.914 line:80%
I think she's getting married soon,
so gift her a lot of congratulatory money.

476
00:39:34.831 --> 00:39:35.957 line:80%
Getting married?

477
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.421 line:80%
KANG JI-WON

478
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:44.966 line:80%
Hey.

479
00:39:46.218 --> 00:39:47.761 line:80%
Eun-ho, I'm sorry.

480
00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:49.721 line:80%
It's fine. Well...

481
00:39:50.764 --> 00:39:53.934 line:80%
Congratulations on your wedding.

482
00:39:55.185 --> 00:39:57.646 line:80%
No, don't worry about what he said.

483
00:39:57.729 --> 00:39:59.022 line:80%
I'll take care of it.

484
00:40:00.107 --> 00:40:01.483 line:80%
I'll do it for you.

485
00:40:03.318 --> 00:40:04.528 line:80%
Eun-ho...

486
00:40:06.196 --> 00:40:07.864 line:80%
You were my first love.

487
00:40:09.074 --> 00:40:10.117 line:80%
Let me do it.

488
00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.745 line:80%
They're going to be your family.

489
00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:16.998 line:80%
I'll treat you to something special.

490
00:40:35.142 --> 00:40:39.146 line:80%
Your one and only grandfather
was admitted, and you came so late.

491
00:40:39.229 --> 00:40:42.357 line:80%
If I was more impatient,
I would've died waiting.

492
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.359 line:80%
You live to see ten more years.

493
00:40:45.402 --> 00:40:46.236 line:80%
What?

494
00:40:46.736 --> 00:40:48.405 line:80%
I just came back from Japan.

495
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:50.866 line:80%
Did it go well?

496
00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:55.287 line:80%
It's Yu-ra. We just met briefly.

497
00:40:58.874 --> 00:41:00.292 line:80%
There's no one like her.

498
00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:05.839 line:80%
She's a hundred times better
than that Kang Ji-won.

499
00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:10.510 line:80%
Grandfather, just leave her alone.

500
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:13.263 line:80%
She has nothing to do with me.

501
00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:15.390 line:80%
I can't just leave her alone.

502
00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:16.975 line:80%
They're my feelings.

503
00:41:17.058 --> 00:41:18.852 line:80%
You foolish boy.

504
00:41:18.935 --> 00:41:21.313 line:80%
You're in love with someone who's taken.

505
00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:23.982 line:80%
You broke the promise between families.

506
00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:27.485 line:80%
You used the villa and yacht,
and lit fireworks.

507
00:41:27.569 --> 00:41:30.238 line:80%
I heard you even had the staff fly drones!

508
00:41:31.072 --> 00:41:33.533 line:80%
How is that just your feelings?

509
00:41:37.913 --> 00:41:41.917 line:80%
Do you hear about everything I do?

510
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.418 line:80%
Of course.

511
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:46.671 line:80%
You're not free.
Since your dad's no longer with us.

512
00:41:51.885 --> 00:41:52.886 line:80%
You...

513
00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:58.725 line:80%
are the one who will lead and take care of

514
00:41:59.726 --> 00:42:03.897 line:80%
over 600,000 employees at U&K
for the next 30 or 40 years.

515
00:42:04.564 --> 00:42:07.067 line:80%
You poor boy. Such a fool.

516
00:42:07.651 --> 00:42:09.861 line:80%
Just a fool in love.

517
00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:13.281 line:80%
Goodness.

518
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:21.665 line:80%
What?

519
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.721 line:80%
There were a lot
of things I missed out on.

520
00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:43.979 line:80%
What is it?

521
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.906 line:80%
Grandfather...

522
00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:57.450 line:80%
must've cried a lot.

523
00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:12.590 line:80%
I'll do better. Don't worry.

524
00:43:23.727 --> 00:43:24.936 line:80%
I'm sorry.

525
00:44:00.263 --> 00:44:01.348 line:80%
It's so cold.

526
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:02.682 line:80%
What brings you here?

527
00:44:04.434 --> 00:44:07.979 line:80%
We have a company warehouse near here.

528
00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:09.564 line:80%
I stopped by on my way...

529
00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:15.695 line:80%
Actually, that's a lie.

530
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:19.449 line:80%
I came because I missed you.

531
00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:29.167 line:80%
Did something happen?

532
00:44:35.382 --> 00:44:38.051 line:80%
Do you remember asking me
what I wanted to be?

533
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.764 line:80%
I never thought about it before.

534
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:48.019 line:80%
My life was decided since birth.

535
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:53.608 line:80%
So I studied and worked only for U&K.

536
00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:02.075 line:80%
I want to be solid land.

537
00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:09.791 line:80%
But you want to be something now.

538
00:45:14.504 --> 00:45:15.547 line:80%
I don't.

539
00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:20.260 line:80%
I could never be that.

540
00:45:25.557 --> 00:45:28.059 line:80%
Then let's start with something simple.

541
00:45:28.143 --> 00:45:30.186 line:80%
What you want to do right now.

542
00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:39.028 line:80%
When I first came back,
I just didn't know what to do.

543
00:45:39.654 --> 00:45:42.365 line:80%
"Where do I run to?
How will I make money?"

544
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:46.369 line:80%
And I hated
the sight of Min-hwan and Su-min.

545
00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:53.293 line:80%
So I told myself
I wouldn't just take it anymore.

546
00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:56.379 line:80%
Then I made food spilled all over him.

547
00:46:00.675 --> 00:46:02.010 line:80%
Come on!

548
00:46:05.472 --> 00:46:09.976 line:80%
After that, I could see things
a little more clearly.

549
00:46:15.315 --> 00:46:18.485 line:80%
Getting them to marry is just the process.

550
00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:25.200 line:80%
In the end, I have to be happy.

551
00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:29.954 line:80%
I have to do what I love.

552
00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:32.373 line:80%
I have to meet...

553
00:46:36.377 --> 00:46:37.670 line:80%
friends I like.

554
00:46:51.559 --> 00:46:52.810 line:80%
Can I...

555
00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:57.315 line:80%
hold your hand?

556
00:47:39.482 --> 00:47:41.442 line:80%
Get Min-hwan to marry Su-min,

557
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.613 line:80%
and you be happy, Ji-won.

558
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:58.585 line:80%
Is it your wedding?

559
00:47:58.668 --> 00:48:00.920 line:80%
Just wear what I pick for you.

560
00:48:01.004 --> 00:48:03.047 line:80%
This is very expensive!

561
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:05.633 line:80%
It's Authentique!

562
00:48:05.717 --> 00:48:07.635 line:80%
Who cares if it's expensive?

563
00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:10.388 line:80%
The color sucks,
and the shape looks weird.

564
00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:14.017 line:80%
Your undiscerning eyes...
Should I just claw them out?

565
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.437 line:80%
Why argue so early?
Are you going early and wait?

566
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.106 line:80%
Are you insane? I'm going 30 minute late.

567
00:48:20.189 --> 00:48:23.151 line:80%
She must wait
if she wants my precious boy.

568
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:27.322 line:80%
It pisses me off that a good-for-nothing
brat's stealing you away.

569
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:28.740 line:80%
Mom.

570
00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:31.826 line:80%
You're getting me a house, right?

571
00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:34.495 line:80%
Are you looking? What's the budget like?

572
00:48:34.996 --> 00:48:36.164 line:80%
What the hell?

573
00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:40.585 line:80%
Put this on! This is classy and nice!

574
00:48:40.668 --> 00:48:42.086 line:80%
I don't want to...

575
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:43.171 line:80%
Not the red!

576
00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:45.548 line:80%
I'm in front of your house. Come out.

577
00:48:47.634 --> 00:48:49.677 line:80%
HAEYEONG VILLA

578
00:48:54.682 --> 00:48:56.017 line:80%
Damn it.

579
00:48:58.102 --> 00:49:00.355 line:80%
What the hell? Why are you here?

580
00:49:00.855 --> 00:49:02.607 line:80%
Isn't the family meeting today?

581
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.317 line:80%
What? Well...

582
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:06.694 line:80%
Don't be scared.

583
00:49:11.407 --> 00:49:13.242 line:80%
I know you're mine.

584
00:49:29.759 --> 00:49:31.469 line:80%
What on earth are you doing?

585
00:49:32.053 --> 00:49:34.806 line:80%
What? I'm just checking
how my man's doing.

586
00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:41.479 line:80%
I have about ten minutes.

587
00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:43.439 line:80%
I won't finish in ten minutes.

588
00:49:43.523 --> 00:49:44.941 line:80%
What?

589
00:49:46.401 --> 00:49:47.777 line:80%
You'll be late.

590
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.530 line:80%
Go and introduce Ji-won to your parents.

591
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:05.253 line:80%
Chef, I'll do it.

592
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.048 line:80%
Do you not trust me?

593
00:50:09.132 --> 00:50:10.133 line:80%
No.

594
00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:14.637 line:80%
It's important to me.

595
00:50:32.613 --> 00:50:33.990 line:80%
I'll be right back.

596
00:50:34.073 --> 00:50:35.116 line:80%
Okay.

597
00:50:39.162 --> 00:50:41.581 line:80%
Why does he look so sad?

598
00:50:43.624 --> 00:50:45.001 line:80%
Why is no one here yet?

599
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:50.173 line:80%
Hello! I'm sorry I'm late.

600
00:50:50.256 --> 00:50:51.424 line:80%
The traffic...

601
00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:56.304 line:80%
-No one's here?
-No, no one yet.

602
00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:57.805 line:80%
What?

603
00:51:03.227 --> 00:51:04.395 line:80%
Where are you?

604
00:51:04.479 --> 00:51:06.063 line:80%
How could you be late?

605
00:51:07.607 --> 00:51:10.359 line:80%
My parents are both here!
But you're not here!

606
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.695 line:80%
Today is important!

607
00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:14.155 line:80%
I'm at the door.

608
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:15.948 line:80%
What took you so long?

609
00:51:16.032 --> 00:51:17.158 line:80%
Mom!

610
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:18.326 line:80%
Hurry up.

611
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:21.537 line:80%
She's not here yet?

612
00:51:21.621 --> 00:51:23.873 line:80%
She is. She went to the bathroom.

613
00:51:49.315 --> 00:51:52.151 line:80%
I thought I was late.
But I guess I'm on time.

614
00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:55.780 line:80%
Mother, Father. It's nice to meet you.

615
00:52:02.495 --> 00:52:04.956 line:80%
Wait. Aren't you...

616
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:06.707 line:80%
You are!

617
00:52:06.791 --> 00:52:08.209 line:80%
I'm happy with now.

618
00:52:09.502 --> 00:52:11.128 line:80%
What's your problem?

619
00:52:11.212 --> 00:52:16.425 line:80%
It's obvious what kind of family
she'll marry into.

620
00:52:16.509 --> 00:52:19.887 line:80%
Oh, my. So you're Min-hwan's mother.

621
00:52:23.683 --> 00:52:25.476 line:80%
Thank you.

622
00:52:27.687 --> 00:52:30.314 line:80%
I heard your parents passed away early.

623
00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:34.610 line:80%
You must've lacked home discipline.

624
00:52:35.403 --> 00:52:39.490 line:80%
No, my father passed away when I was 23.

625
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:41.826 line:80%
I received enough.

626
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:48.916 line:80%
Of course, since my mom left home
when I was 14,

627
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.918 line:80%
I didn't get her influence.

628
00:52:51.002 --> 00:52:54.005 line:80%
A good thing, though.
She was having an affair.

629
00:52:56.048 --> 00:52:57.592 line:80%
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

630
00:53:10.354 --> 00:53:14.442 line:80%
I was curious as to
who Min-hwan would bring.

631
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:18.321 line:80%
And he brought quite the woman.

632
00:53:19.655 --> 00:53:22.033 line:80%
Mom, Ji-won's a great girl.

633
00:53:22.116 --> 00:53:23.242 line:80%
She's really nice.

634
00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:26.913 line:80%
She won't make you work at all! I'm sure.

635
00:53:29.332 --> 00:53:32.585 line:80%
What's with the eagle wings?
What about the clothes I bought?

636
00:53:33.085 --> 00:53:35.463 line:80%
You bought her clothes?

637
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.300 line:80%
Well, no. Not these. No.

638
00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:42.345 line:80%
I'll wear those clothes
on a more special day.

639
00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:46.140 line:80%
But I brought the bag.

640
00:53:51.395 --> 00:53:55.608 line:80%
Mother, thank you for raising him so well.

641
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:58.361 line:80%
To celebrate joining his family,
he bought me

642
00:53:58.444 --> 00:54:01.989 line:80%
everything from shoes to clothes.
He's so sweet.

643
00:54:04.325 --> 00:54:07.620 line:80%
He only ever bought me red long johns
with his first paycheck.

644
00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:10.081 line:80%
Seriously?

645
00:54:10.164 --> 00:54:11.832 line:80%
That's not right.

646
00:54:16.796 --> 00:54:18.756 line:80%
CAT CARE TRUST AGREEMENT

647
00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:24.553 line:80%
TRUSTOR: YU JI-HYUK

648
00:54:30.685 --> 00:54:32.770 line:80%
No matter what happens to you,

649
00:54:32.853 --> 00:54:35.606 line:80%
your cat will receive proper care here.

650
00:54:37.233 --> 00:54:38.609 line:80%
Thank you.

651
00:54:39.318 --> 00:54:41.862 line:80%
Are you going somewhere? Why the papers?

652
00:54:43.322 --> 00:54:45.741 line:80%
Who knows what will happen to me?

653
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:50.287 line:80%
You don't even like cats.

654
00:54:52.373 --> 00:54:53.582 line:80%
I like him.

655
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.503 line:80%
I have one more favor to ask.

656
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.943 line:80%
I wonder if she's doing well.

657
00:55:26.741 --> 00:55:27.950 line:80%
Good boy.

658
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:33.998 line:80%
I'll protect you.

659
00:55:39.462 --> 00:55:44.258 line:80%
I'll just say this
because I'm an honest person.

660
00:55:45.259 --> 00:55:46.552 line:80%
I love you, Mom.

661
00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:51.432 line:80%
I do not like you.

662
00:55:52.016 --> 00:55:54.226 line:80%
I never thought of accepting

663
00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:56.395 line:80%
a woman like you into our family.

664
00:55:57.938 --> 00:56:00.316 line:80%
You didn't learn much with no parents.

665
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:05.112 line:80%
But it's okay as long
as you're willing to learn from now on.

666
00:56:05.905 --> 00:56:08.783 line:80%
You're willing to, right?

667
00:56:10.618 --> 00:56:11.911 line:80%
Yes, of course.

668
00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:14.371 line:80%
Okay.

669
00:56:15.498 --> 00:56:18.334 line:80%
I'm not that uptight.

670
00:56:18.417 --> 00:56:20.002 line:80%
Sexism is wrong.

671
00:56:20.086 --> 00:56:22.004 line:80%
You're both equally precious.

672
00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:26.801 line:80%
However, that's only in society.

673
00:56:26.884 --> 00:56:28.135 line:80%
Not at home.

674
00:56:29.178 --> 00:56:30.471 line:80%
Right.

675
00:56:31.514 --> 00:56:34.183 line:80%
The family life depends
on how the woman does.

676
00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:37.686 line:80%
Feed your man and keep your house clean.

677
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.563 line:80%
Raise your child well.

678
00:56:39.647 --> 00:56:42.149 line:80%
Yes, Mother. I can do it!

679
00:56:44.276 --> 00:56:48.364 line:80%
Men lose energy
if they frequent the kitchen.

680
00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:50.950 line:80%
No matter how much they gripe and say no,

681
00:56:51.033 --> 00:56:54.954 line:80%
this is a known fact all around the world.

682
00:56:55.496 --> 00:56:57.540 line:80%
That's why I'm learning to cook

683
00:56:57.623 --> 00:56:59.291 line:80%
-so I can cook for him.
-Yes.

684
00:56:59.375 --> 00:57:02.253 line:80%
You must feed him breakfast.

685
00:57:02.336 --> 00:57:05.506 line:80%
Nothing ridiculous like bread or cereal.

686
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:07.550 line:80%
Cook him soup or stew with rice.

687
00:57:08.592 --> 00:57:10.219 line:80%
Yes, I understand.

688
00:57:11.137 --> 00:57:14.682 line:80%
And as for kids, how about three or four?

689
00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:16.767 line:80%
Have as many as you can.

690
00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.395 line:80%
That sounds good.

691
00:57:19.478 --> 00:57:22.314 line:80%
I didn't have siblings growing up.
I was lonely.

692
00:57:22.398 --> 00:57:24.525 line:80%
I like that.

693
00:57:26.193 --> 00:57:28.445 line:80%
I'll call you when I have time.

694
00:57:28.529 --> 00:57:29.905 line:80%
Let's go see a doctor.

695
00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:34.535 line:80%
There are so many uteruses in bad shape
these days.

696
00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:38.747 line:80%
I'll take a look
and see what the doctor says.

697
00:57:38.831 --> 00:57:43.836 line:80%
As long as you took care of yourself,
there's no reason to say no.

698
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.755 line:80%
Let's do a health checkup too.

699
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:52.428 line:80%
I haven't been able to see my ancestors,

700
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:54.013 line:80%
and it's bothered me.

701
00:57:55.014 --> 00:57:57.474 line:80%
Since we have a new family member,

702
00:57:57.558 --> 00:57:59.643 line:80%
let's revive ancestral rites.

703
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:01.562 line:80%
Revive?

704
00:58:02.229 --> 00:58:03.814 line:80%
Red, right. White, left.

705
00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.401 line:80%
I'll teach you, so don't worry.

706
00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:11.071 line:80%
Just keep this in mind.

707
00:58:11.155 --> 00:58:13.782 line:80%
Treat your elders with care.

708
00:58:13.866 --> 00:58:15.993 line:80%
Be obedient to your husband.

709
00:58:16.076 --> 00:58:18.078 line:80%
Raise children properly.

710
00:58:19.622 --> 00:58:23.125 line:80%
And keeping your career after marriage,

711
00:58:23.209 --> 00:58:24.752 line:80%
I approve of it.

712
00:58:29.173 --> 00:58:30.966 line:80%
Why would I work, Mother?

713
00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:37.389 line:80%
Are you going to quit?

714
00:58:39.558 --> 00:58:42.895 line:80%
I don't want to,
but considering what you're mother said,

715
00:58:42.978 --> 00:58:44.146 line:80%
I'd be greedy.

716
00:58:45.064 --> 00:58:46.106 line:80%
No, no!

717
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:48.692 line:80%
Do you know how expensive kids are?

718
00:58:48.776 --> 00:58:50.736 line:80%
How could you just play at home?

719
00:58:51.654 --> 00:58:53.364 line:80%
Play?

720
00:58:53.447 --> 00:58:55.282 line:80%
To treat you with care,

721
00:58:55.366 --> 00:58:56.408 line:80%
serve Min-hwan,

722
00:58:56.492 --> 00:58:58.786 line:80%
and raise my children properly,

723
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:03.415 line:80%
I won't have enough time in a day.

724
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:08.128 line:80%
Also, it's not red on the right,
white on the left.

725
00:59:08.212 --> 00:59:11.131 line:80%
It's red on the east, white on the west.

726
00:59:12.925 --> 00:59:14.760 line:80%
-What?
-You said it was left.

727
00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.179 line:80%
Same difference.

728
00:59:17.263 --> 00:59:20.683 line:80%
I did an ancestral rite for my father
every year on my own.

729
00:59:20.766 --> 00:59:22.559 line:80%
I have no objections either.

730
00:59:22.643 --> 00:59:26.021 line:80%
This is why home discipline is important.

731
00:59:26.105 --> 00:59:28.857 line:80%
That's not the case with customs.

732
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:31.610 line:80%
Daughters aren't supposed to do that.

733
00:59:33.654 --> 00:59:38.784 line:80%
Your father probably thinks it's his fault
to have a daughter and understands.

734
00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:41.287 line:80%
This is why everyone wants a son.

735
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:43.914 line:80%
There's a reason for that.

736
00:59:43.998 --> 00:59:45.958 line:80%
But I don't understand, lady.

737
00:59:50.754 --> 00:59:52.006 line:80%
"Lady"?

738
00:59:54.383 --> 00:59:55.592 line:80%
Are you a judge?

739
00:59:56.802 --> 00:59:58.846 line:80%
Why do you judge my dad like that?

740
00:59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.848 line:80%
Kang Ji-won, are you crazy?

741
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.308 line:80%
How dare you?

742
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.184 line:80%
Wait. Don't say anything.

743
01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:06.603 line:80%
"Lady"?

744
01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.565 line:80%
Hey, are you done?

745
01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:14.862 line:80%
This wedding's off.

746
01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:17.823 line:80%
That makes us strangers.

747
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.202 line:80%
Lady, wake up.

748
01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.913 line:80%
Your son isn't that great.

749
01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:27.249 line:80%
Even if he was,

750
01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:30.711 line:80%
you should know someone else's child
is just as precious!

751
01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:35.632 line:80%
Listen carefully.

752
01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:37.634 line:80%
It's not you.

753
01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:40.429 line:80%
It's me that's calling this wedding off.

754
01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:41.555 line:80%
Got it?

755
01:00:43.182 --> 01:00:45.642 line:80%
Ji-won, are you crazy? Hey...

756
01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:51.065 line:80%
Wait here. Hey, Ji-won!

757
01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:52.274 line:80%
Kang Ji-won!

758
01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:01.283 line:80%
Kang Ji-won!

759
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.620 line:80%
Hey!

760
01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:11.460 line:80%
What are you doing?

761
01:01:12.795 --> 01:01:15.339 line:80%
What do you think?
I'm breaking up with you.

762
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.511 line:80%
What? Breaking up?

763
01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.430 line:80%
Are you kidding me?

764
01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:30.687 line:80%
I never want to see you again.

765
01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:39.696 line:80%
You little...

766
01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:44.993 line:80%
It's not easy for a woman
to throw a man who's bigger.

767
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.122 line:80%
So when he's off guard,

768
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.334 line:80%
do it in one move.

769
01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:11.145 line:80%
Min-hwan!

770
01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:13.814 line:80%
What the hell?

771
01:02:43.135 --> 01:02:45.304 line:80%
Kang Ji-won!

772
01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.764 line:80%
How dare you shout? You cheater!

773
01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:50.392 line:80%
What else do you have
besides being pretty?

774
01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:52.394 line:80%
How could you do that to Su-min?

775
01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:55.022 line:80%
My life is over!

776
01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.149 line:80%
I have a fiancé!

777
01:02:57.232 --> 01:03:00.152 line:80%
You said nothing was going on with her.

778
01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:04.114 line:80%
Will I be able to live like this
if they get married?

779
01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:06.658 line:80%
How could you do this?

780
01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:08.869 line:80%
Jeong Su-min, stop!

781
01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.704 line:80%
I won't let it go this time.

782
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.873 line:80%
You fix what you did.

783
01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:20.214 line:80%
