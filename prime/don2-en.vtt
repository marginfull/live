1
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.580 line:82%
I thought, this time, you'd be captured.

2
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.700 line:82%
-Or I'd lose you.
-By whom?

3
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.580 line:82%
By Roma?

4
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.290 line:82%
-The disc that you gave police...
-That's fake.

5
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.370 line:82%
It never had anything.

6
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.220 line:82%
Don't worry, sweetheart.

7
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.540 line:82%
Now, I'm the king of Asia's underworld.
I am the king.

8
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.730 line:82%
It's been five years since that day.

9
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.110 line:82%
And now, I, Don, am the undisputed king
of the Asian drug market.

10
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:49.660 line:82%
The king.

11
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.990 line:82%
Now, my next goal is Europe.

12
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.160 line:82%
The European drug cartel is well aware
that I can sell drugs at a lower price.

13
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.200 line:82%
If I establish my foothold in Europe,
then they'll be finished.

14
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.330 line:82%
You speak to me like that again,
I'll have my man here slit your throat.

15
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.870 line:82%
How dare you speak to me...

16
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.750 line:82%
I speak the way I want.
This is my business.

17
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.860 line:82%
Gentlemen.

18
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.620 line:82%
I've had enough already.

19
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.320 line:82%
Gents.

20
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.790 line:82%
This is Jimmy Coogan.

21
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.280 line:82%
This cartel's boss.

22
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.360 line:82%
He's brought everyone together so that
they can set aside their personal issues

23
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.620 line:82%
and decide about killing me.

24
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.540 line:82%
All those in favor of killing Don?

25
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.740 line:82%
Very well, then.

26
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.120 line:82%
I learnt about this meeting
a little late.

27
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.720 line:82%
♪ Inside every heart ♪

28
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.310 line:82%
♪ There's excitement ♪

29
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.400 line:82%
♪ Look, who has come ♪

30
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.660 line:82%
Don.

31
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.370 line:82%
Jaruwan is conveying thanks to you
for coming to his door again.

32
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.120 line:82%
I'm not here for Jaruwan's door,
but for my consignment.

33
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.620 line:82%
There's your consignment.

34
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.580 line:82%
Damn! Now, I'll have to
drive the boat myself.

35
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.450 line:82%
There is no need for you
to go anywhere, Don.

36
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.080 line:82%
The reason for this hospitality?

37
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.950 line:82%
Jimmy Coogan.

38
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.430 line:82%
If we want to sell our goods in Europe,

39
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.110 line:82%
then your life is our ticket
to that place.

40
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.490 line:82%
And I guess
he's the ticket collector, right?

41
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.490 line:82%
Hello, big boy.

42
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.580 line:82%
Any last wish?

43
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.590 line:82%
Which is the best
Italian restaurant in Bangkok?

44
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.960 line:82%
-Meaning?
-Meaning, that after killing all of you

45
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.340 line:82%
tonight, I was thinking of having Italian
for dinner. You know, spaghetti bolognese,

46
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.910 line:82%
a glass of red wine...

47
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.200 line:82%
what? Nobody likes Italian?

48
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.080 line:82%
-What a shame!
-Shoot him.

49
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.790 line:82%
Get over here!

50
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:05.980 line:82%
See you around.

51
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.490 line:82%
Hi.

52
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.040 line:82%
-Good evening.
-Hi, Roma.

53
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.740 line:82%
Hi. Is this the file I'd asked for?

54
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.100 line:82%
-Yes.
-Thanks.

55
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.790 line:82%
It's him.

56
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.490 line:82%
Do you have any plans for tonight?

57
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.290 line:82%
No plan. Why?

58
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.600 line:82%
Why? Because it's your birthday.

59
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.790 line:82%
I thought we should celebrate.

60
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.830 line:82%
My birthday?

61
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.830 line:82%
It's not my birthday today, Arjun.

62
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.240 line:82%
I know.

63
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.880 line:82%
It's my birthday.

64
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.620 line:82%
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

65
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.180 line:82%
I... I completely forgot...

66
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.990 line:82%
-Happy birthday, Arjun.
-Thanks.

67
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.260 line:82%
One second.

68
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.620 line:82%
Hello?

69
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.480 line:82%
Yes, I'll be right there.

70
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.670 line:82%
Okay.

71
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.950 line:82%
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

72
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.080 line:82%
You wanted to see me, sir?

73
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.370 line:82%
Yes.

74
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.050 line:82%
Sit.

75
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.410 line:82%
Roma, do you know how long
I've served in this department?

76
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.410 line:82%
Thirty seven years.

77
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.830 line:82%
And in these 37 years,
I've handled 186 cases.

78
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.080 line:82%
I've worked with very brave
and able officers.

79
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.030 line:82%
But I'll miss you the most.

80
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.290 line:82%
I'm sorry, sir?

81
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.160 line:82%
I'm retiring, Roma.

82
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.190 line:82%
-What?
-Yes.

83
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.540 line:82%
I wanted to tell you myself.

84
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.620 line:82%
Come on, I'm not dying!

85
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.700 line:82%
Come, walk me to my car.

86
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.200 line:82%
But sir, can't you change your decision?

87
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.910 line:82%
No, I don't want to.

88
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.660 line:82%
And what about Don?

89
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.950 line:82%
Yes, he's the only one I couldn't capture.

90
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.200 line:82%
He is your responsibility now.

91
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.160 line:82%
And I know you'll do it.

92
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.870 line:82%
Good evening, Mr. Malik.

93
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.560 line:82%
-Don?
-Put your hands up!

94
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.790 line:82%
Up where I can see them.

95
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.080 line:82%
Whoa, take it easy, guys.

96
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.760 line:82%
-Down on your knees!
-Really? I'm wearing white.

97
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.440 line:82%
Shut up and get down on your knees.

98
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.040 line:82%
I'm very happy to see you too,
my wild cat.

99
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.620 line:82%
Hey, watch it.

100
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.660 line:82%
Why is everyone so angry?

101
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.790 line:82%
Absolute immunity.

102
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.040 line:82%
Drop all the charges against me.

103
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.790 line:82%
Here, in Malaysia and in every other
country where there's a warrant for me.

104
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.880 line:82%
Every police department in the world
is looking for you.

105
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.220 line:82%
-How can I talk to everybody?
-Really?

106
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.040 line:82%
My mother would've been
so happy to hear that.

107
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.140 line:82%
Happy?

108
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.800 line:82%
She would've shot you herself.

109
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.120 line:82%
Mr. Malik, you didn't know my mother.

110
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.160 line:82%
Immunity or nothing.

111
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.740 line:82%
Don,
what you're asking for is impossible.

112
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.490 line:82%
Perhaps I can probably save you
from the death penalty. That's all.

113
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.160 line:82%
If you get the names of my suppliers,
everyone who is involved in this business,

114
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.640 line:82%
for all this information
along with proof...

115
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.830 line:82%
...then your offer
is quite small, Mr. Malik.

116
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.160 line:82%
Do something about it. You know...

117
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.790 line:82%
Make me an offer I can't refuse.

118
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:46.990 line:82%
Okay.

119
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.740 line:82%
If you don't cooperate with us,

120
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.330 line:82%
then believe me

121
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.090 line:82%
along with jail,
you'll also get the death penalty.

122
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.160 line:82%
Death will come to all of us, Mr. Malik.

123
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.160 line:82%
But perhaps at this point, going to jail
seems more of an advantage.

124
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.990 line:82%
I've waited a long time for this day.

125
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.200 line:82%
How does it feel to be here

126
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.370 line:82%
-in this jail?
-Yeah, it's okay.

127
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.200 line:82%
I'm just unhappy
with the color of this uniform.

128
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.410 line:82%
But you don't seem happy.

129
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.030 line:82%
What's the matter?

130
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.490 line:82%
This sudden act of morality...

131
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.970 line:82%
...what's this drama you're up to?

132
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.770 line:82%
In our trade, when people profit more
by your death than by your life

133
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.870 line:82%
then it's better to understand
it's time to move on.

134
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.280 line:82%
I figured I'd do something good

135
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.080 line:82%
but you people didn't give me
a chance to change.

136
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.550 line:82%
Very sad.

137
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.240 line:82%
If given that chance, you would've given
us all the information truthfully.

138
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.150 line:82%
-Isn't that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

139
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.200 line:82%
I've lied to you once...

140
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.790 line:82%
I didn't feel good about it.

141
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.950 line:82%
Shut up.

142
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.410 line:82%
Your anger is conveying
what's in your heart.

143
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.120 line:82%
What?

144
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.490 line:82%
-You, come!
-Roma, all that happened...

145
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.790 line:82%
...the one thing I regret the most...

146
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.790 line:82%
...is that I betrayed you.

147
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.330 line:82%
For once, I wanted to see you behind bars

148
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.640 line:82%
and today, I have.

149
00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.160 line:82%
So goodbye, Don.

150
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.650 line:82%
If you let me live, it would be
the biggest mistake of your life.

151
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.990 line:82%
Welcome to hell, Don.

152
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.200 line:82%
Shower number 14
is clogged with some trash.

153
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.830 line:82%
Inform housekeeping.

154
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.290 line:82%
Still upset?

155
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.080 line:82%
I've come here to offer you my friendship.

156
00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.910 line:82%
Forget the past.

157
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.410 line:82%
What should I forget?

158
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.210 line:82%
That I'm in this cage
for five years, thanks to you!

159
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.270 line:82%
You're here because of your ego, Vardhaan.

160
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.810 line:82%
You don't know how to change
with time and circumstances.

161
00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:14.980 line:82%
Come on!

162
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.410 line:82%
Come on! Get up!

163
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.329 line:82%
lf you know, then what are you doing here?

164
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.080 line:82%
I've come here for you, Vardhaan.

165
00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.160 line:82%
With an offer.

166
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.840 line:82%
Really?

167
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.390 line:82%
I have an offer too.

168
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.220 line:82%
How about I cut you to pieces
and feed you to the dogs here?

169
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.660 line:82%
That will not benefit
you nor me, Vardhaan.

170
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.330 line:82%
Only the dogs.

171
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.370 line:82%
And I don't like dogs at all!

172
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.450 line:82%
I'm on a death row, Vardhaan.

173
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.270 line:82%
You kill me now

174
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.180 line:82%
or the law does in two weeks...

175
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.720 line:82%
it's all the same.

176
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.910 line:82%
Think, Vardhaan!

177
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.830 line:82%
The man who could have had himself
arrested anywhere in the world,

178
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.490 line:82%
why did he chose this country,
where he knew

179
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.410 line:82%
that his enemy
is eagerly waiting to kill him?

180
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.370 line:82%
Don!

181
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.700 line:82%
Get out of here! All of you!

182
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:42.910 line:82%
Go on.

183
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.240 line:82%
I've come to help you escape.

184
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.740 line:82%
And what do you want in return?

185
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.270 line:82%
-I'll tell you when the time comes.
-No, no, no.

186
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.550 line:82%
You will tell me right now.

187
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.660 line:82%
Right now, you better think

188
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.370 line:82%
whether you want to get out
of here or not.

189
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.200 line:82%
If this is another one of your tricks...

190
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.580 line:82%
No, it isn't.

191
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.640 line:82%
What do I have to do?

192
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.290 line:82%
Good.

193
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.540 line:82%
Two days later, kitchen supplies
are going to be delivered here.

194
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.080 line:82%
-You see him?
-Hmm.

195
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.790 line:82%
I want that janitor's duty
as soon as possible.

196
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.890 line:82%
-Yes, but...
-Do it.

197
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.740 line:82%
-Please.
-Okay.

198
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.290 line:82%
Now what?

199
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.770 line:82%
Now, wait till Saturday.

200
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.290 line:82%
Why? What will happen on Saturday?

201
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.990 line:82%
My lawyer is coming to meet me.

202
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.910 line:82%
Any other question?

203
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.200 line:82%
Yes, one more question. Can I ask?

204
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.430 line:82%
No. Got your answer?

205
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.690 line:82%
Good night.

206
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.130 line:82%
Tonight, we have get out
of here. You ready?

207
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.830 line:82%
-Oh, yes.
-Yeah.

208
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.240 line:82%
Hey, you want to eat my food?

209
00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.330 line:82%
-You don't want it?
-Hate fish.

210
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.940 line:82%
Help! He's dying, we need help here.

211
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.150 line:82%
My friend is very sick. He's dying.

212
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.100 line:82%
Thank you, thank you.
My friend is very sick.

213
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.000 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

214
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.860 line:82%
Hope I'm not disturbing you?

215
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.910 line:82%
No, not at all.

216
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.660 line:82%
Are those for me?

217
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:09.740 line:82%
Yeah.

218
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.660 line:82%
Come in.

219
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.160 line:82%
Thanks.

220
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.370 line:82%
Who is this?

221
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.410 line:82%
My brother. Ramesh.

222
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.790 line:82%
Your brother.

223
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.200 line:82%
Where is he?

224
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:34.340 line:82%
He's dead.

225
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.720 line:82%
I'm sorry.

226
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.280 line:82%
That's okay.

227
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.390 line:82%
Roma, remember you'd once told me

228
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.270 line:82%
you didn't want to think about
anything else till Don was arrested?

229
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:59.950 line:82%
Yes, I remember.

230
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.910 line:82%
So, well... now the situation is...

231
00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.080 line:82%
Your phone is ringing, yet again.

232
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.530 line:82%
I'm sorry.

233
00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.290 line:82%
Just a second.

234
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.320 line:82%
Hello?

235
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.640 line:82%

Now listen, what I want from you.

274
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.870 line:82%
In Zurich's Russian Commercial bank,

275
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.450 line:82%
there's a safety deposit box
which belonged to your ex-boss Boris.

276
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.020 line:82%
He gave one set of keys to you

277
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.110 line:82%
and the second,
to your partner, Singhania.

278
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.040 line:82%
I have the second key, thanks to you.

279
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.490 line:82%
If you had taken the key
from Singhania before poisoning him,

280
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.050 line:82%
then you'd have profited from it.

281
00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.950 line:82%
What's in that box?

282
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.330 line:82%
You'll know when the box is opened.

283
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.170 line:82%
Where is the key, Vardhaan?

284
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.100 line:82%
Zurich Airport.

285
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.940 line:82%
Baggage locker number 1-3-5.

286
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.320 line:82%
Combination lock number 5-4-8-1-7.

287
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.370 line:82%
Got it.

288
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.910 line:82%
Sweetheart, reach Zurich
as soon as possible.

289
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.390 line:82%
We'll meet you there in two days.

290
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.840 line:82%
You trust this girl completely?

291
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:36.730 line:82%
Ayesha.

292
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.710 line:82%
Sorry?

293
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.710 line:82%
Ayesha. My name.

294
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.390 line:82%
You were asking?

295
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.370 line:82%
No... I just wanted to know if...

296
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.830 line:82%
...a girl like you should be doing...

297
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.190 line:82%
...such dangerous tasks.

298
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.240 line:82%
Don't just notice my pretty face,
Mr. Vardhaan.

299
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.100 line:82%
I have a lot of other skills.

300
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.970 line:82%
-See you in Zurich.
-See ya.

301
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.680 line:82%
Welcome to Zurich.

302
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.260 line:82%
Do you know him?

303
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.110 line:82%
Fabian Kohl.

304
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.970 line:82%
German Deutsch Zentral Bank's President.

305
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.830 line:82%
Influential, powerful
and well-respected.

306
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.790 line:82%
But very people know the fact that

307
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.120 line:82%
the position he has occupied
for the past eight years

308
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.020 line:82%
was meant for someone else.

309
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.630 line:82%
Who?

310
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.800 line:82%
When a committee was set up
to choose the bank's president

311
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.830 line:82%
their first choice wasn't Kohl
but someone else.

312
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.620 line:82%
James Werden.

313
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.590 line:82%
So why didn't they make Werden president?

314
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.040 line:82%
The poor man was killed in a car accident.

315
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.490 line:82%
Kohl had arranged for that accident.

316
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.710 line:82%
Can you guess who helped him?

317
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.630 line:82%
Singhania?

318
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.200 line:82%
That's right, Vardhaan.

319
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:05.650 line:82%
But Kohl's messenger
wasn't aware of the fact that

320
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.290 line:82%
Singhania had recorded
their meeting in this tape.

321
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:14.469 line:82%
So, we're going to blackmail Kohl?

322
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:17.660 line:82%
Yes... and no.

323
00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.909 line:82%
I will definitely blackmail Kohl but

324
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.110 line:82%
through the bank's Vice President,
J. K. Diwan.

325
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.489 line:82%
DZB's Vice President is an Indian?

326
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.330 line:82%
Well, sweetheart, we are everywhere.

327
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.690 line:82%
Why don't we deal with Kohl directly?

328
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.910 line:82%
A minister is more concerned
about power than the king himself.

329
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.690 line:82%
Diwan was Kohl's messenger
who was sent to meet Singhania.

330
00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:52.840 line:82%
What's on your mind?

331
00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.840 line:82%
DZB has its currency center in Berlin.

332
00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.410 line:82%
There, they print 50 and 100 Euro bills.

333
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.280 line:82%
And how much is our demand?

334
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.250 line:82%
I don't want the money.

335
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:08.850 line:82%
Then what do you want?

336
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.040 line:82%
I want the printing plates
used to print 50 and 100 Euro bills.

337
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.850 line:82%
But why would Diwan give us
those printing plates?

338
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.800 line:82%
Blackmail or no blackmail,
he'll be finished, right?

339
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.040 line:82%
Right.

340
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.790 line:82%
Therefore it's important to keep
Fabian Kohl and Diwan out of the picture.

341
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:27.520 line:82%
But how?

342
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:33.080 line:82%
With Diwan's help, I'm going to break
into the currency center.

343
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.790 line:82%
But even if you did steal the plates,

344
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.980 line:82%
it's not a big deal for them
to make new ones.

345
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.700 line:82%
It's not a big deal, sweetheart.

346
00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:50.040 line:82%
But new bills don't make
the old ones worthless.

347
00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:55.330 line:82%
And it will take ages for the bank
to replace every old bill.

348
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.110 line:82%
By then... how do I put it...

349
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.960 line:82%
we'll be billionaires.

350
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:10.980 line:82%
Yes, sir.

351
00:36:11.081 --> 00:36:14.660 line:82%
Roma, I've just had a word
with German Interpol.

352
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.600 line:82%
Don and Vardhaan
were both spotted in Zurich.

353
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.910 line:82%
Don and Vardhaan?

354
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.990 line:82%
What are they doing together?

355
00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.640 line:82%
We need to find that out.

356
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.240 line:82%
The car they were in,
cops spotted it in Berlin.

357
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.370 line:82%
Leave for Berlin immediately.

358
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.230 line:82%
Right away, sir.

359
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.210 line:82%
I have spoken with the Director
of Intelligence, Klaus Weiland.

360
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.200 line:82%
He is attending a charity
fund raiser tomorrow.

361
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.660 line:82%
-Right.
-He'll meet you there. All the best.

362
00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:44.490 line:82%
Okay, sir. Thank you.

363
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.920 line:82%
Excuse me, gentlemen.

364
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.930 line:82%
Mr. Weiland? Roma Bhagat.

365
00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:04.990 line:82%
Det. Malik may have spoken
to you about me?

366
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.450 line:82%
Yes, he did.

367
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.230 line:82%
This is Detective Jens Berkel.
He'll be working the case with you.

368
00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:11.580 line:82%
Nice to meet you.

369
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.080 line:82%
Arjun? Sir.

370
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.250 line:82%
Det Malik wanted me to personally
thank you for all your help.

371
00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.040 line:82%
Tell Malik, he owes me one.

372
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.690 line:82%
Big time.

373
00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.800 line:82%
-I will, sir.
-Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:28.120 line:82%
Thank you, all for being with us today

375
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.040 line:82%
and putting your heart
ahead of your wallet.

376
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.830 line:82%
Would you please join me
to welcome here today

377
00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:39.160 line:82%
our esteemed guest of honor,
the Vice President of the DZB,

378
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.410 line:82%
Mr. J.K. Diwan.

379
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.300 line:82%
We raise our glasses
to your health. Cheers.

380
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.720 line:82%
Cheers.

381
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.920 line:82%
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Enjoy the rest of the evening.

382
00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.160 line:82%
So long, sweetheart.

383
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.540 line:82%
Thank you.

384
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:55.040 line:82%
What happened?

385
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.040 line:82%
That man...

386
00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.290 line:82%
Why do I feel like I know him?

387
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.490 line:82%
Only if he didn't have that face,
then... I'm sure...

388
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.370 line:82%
Find him, Arjun.

389
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.830 line:82%
It's extremely important because
if it wasn't for your support

390
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.120 line:82%
we'd never have been able
to raise any funds.

391
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.540 line:82%
Your phone is ringing.

392
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.700 line:82%
-My phone?
-Yeah.

393
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.290 line:82%
Excuse me. Hello?

394
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.507 line:82%
Congratulations on the new phone, Diwan.

395
00:41:35.598 --> 00:41:39.500 line:82%
This phone's inbox has a video clip
which you'll find really interesting.

396
00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:43.580 line:82%
I advise you to see it alone, else...

397
00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.330 line:82%
...it'll be embarrassing.

398
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.120 line:82%
Whatever I'd promised, I have delivered.

399
00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.620 line:82%
Now, it's your turn.

400
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.810 line:82%
Once Mr. Werden is elected president,

401
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.890 line:82%
it'll be difficult to reach him.

402
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.490 line:82%
Don't worry, it'll be done.

403
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.990 line:82%
Told you you'll find it interesting.

404
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:21.580 line:82%
Apart from this clip,
I also have a bank document.

405
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.510 line:82%
A record of a million dollars
being transferred

406
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.840 line:82%
-to Singhania's Swiss bank account.
-I don't...

407
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.870 line:82%
Signed by you.

408
00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.790 line:82%
Now, it is your good fortune
that I have a good heart.

409
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:38.200 line:82%
What I want is no big deal for you.

410
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.740 line:82%
There's a black car outside, registration
number B-I-U-1-0-3. You have...

411
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:46.160 line:82%
...two minutes.

412
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.040 line:82%
Who are you?

413
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.370 line:82%
Don?

414
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.490 line:82%
No autographs, please.

415
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.540 line:82%
Damn it. Get the car!

416
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.970 line:82%
You are crazy! Do you even
know what you're asking?

417
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.950 line:82%
Yes. Only the information that'll help me
get inside DZB's underground vault.

418
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.870 line:82%
Listen, if you want money

419
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:57.080 line:82%
please, name the amount, you'll get it.
But what you're asking for, is impossible.

420
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.700 line:82%
Do you and Fabian Kohl want to spend
the rest of your lives in prison?

421
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.540 line:82%
The details of what I want
are on that phone.

422
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:08.580 line:82%
And Diwan,

423
00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.200 line:82%
you have 24 hours.

424
00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.240 line:82%
Tic-toc. Tic-toc.

425
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.830 line:82%
Tic-toc. Tic-toc.

426
00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.120 line:82%
Roma, that... there! Roma.

427
00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.740 line:82%
I see you, my wild cat.

428
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.360 line:82%
Don, if I'm caught with you...

429
00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:55.700 line:82%
Relax, Diwan.

430
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.990 line:82%
It's not only difficult to catch Don,
it is impossible.

431
00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:46.790 line:82%
No!

432
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.830 line:82%
Oh, my god!

433
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:00.910 line:82%
Roma... he's gone.

434
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.330 line:82%
Are you all right?

435
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.580 line:82%
Lady, is everything okay?

436
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:07.490 line:82%
-Step aside, sir.
-Hey!

437
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:09.450 line:82%
-Wait a moment...
-Come, Arjun!

438
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.490 line:82%
Police business, sir.
Step away from the car.

439
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.040 line:82%
It's my car.

440
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.330 line:82%
Get out. Please.

441
00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.580 line:82%
Got any money?

442
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:31.830 line:82%
There he is.

443
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.790 line:82%
Time's up. Sorry, Roma. See you soon.

444
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.670 line:82%
Shit.

445
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.540 line:82%
Hello. A moment please, sir.

446
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.450 line:82%
This will destroy us.

447
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:24.910 line:82%
Do what ever you have to do, Diwan.

448
00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:29.290 line:82%
I don't want to hear about
that man, Don, ever again.

449
00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.950 line:82%
Is that understood?

450
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.740 line:82%
You stay here.

451
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:12.700 line:82%
So, Mr. Diwan,

452
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:15.410 line:82%
what can Abdul Jabbar do for you?

453
00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.370 line:82%
I've heard you're a useful man.

454
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.740 line:82%
You've heard right.

455
00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:27.370 line:82%
What's the job?

456
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.620 line:82%
Surely you know Don?

457
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.460 line:82%
He's in Berlin right now.

458
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:36.740 line:82%
I want you to trace him down and...

459
00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:39.290 line:82%
...you know...

460
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.660 line:82%
Why?

461
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.830 line:82%
Why do you want Don killed, Mr. Diwan?

462
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.110 line:82%
Do you need reason or money?

463
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:05.250 line:82%
Now, you're talking.

464
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.190 line:82%
Five million Euros.

465
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:13.850 line:82%
Half right now...

466
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.040 line:82%
...and half when I give you his slit head.

467
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:19.870 line:82%
That's not necessary.

468
00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:25.210 line:82%
Just... complete the job
as soon as possible.

469
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:40.160 line:82%
Vardhaan.

470
00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.540 line:82%
And then you're not able to understand
why we didn't become friends.

471
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:49.700 line:82%
Instead of this, it'd be better if you
think about DZB's security systems.

472
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.040 line:82%
Oh, really.

473
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:52.880 line:82%
Even if Diwan helps us,

474
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.480 line:82%
stealing those plates
from that building isn't easy.

475
00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.160 line:82%
Yeah, I know, Vardhaan.

476
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:03.040 line:82%
We need a computer hacker to control
the building's security system.

477
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.250 line:82%
My remote, please.

478
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:09.050 line:82%
Thank you.

479
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.290 line:82%
But who, Don?

480
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:12.910 line:82%
Anyone who can be useful
to us is either in prison...

481
00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:15.620 line:82%
...or is on the watch list
of FBI or Interpol.

482
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.000 line:82%
Relax, Vardhaan.

483
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:19.890 line:82%
There's one guy...

484
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.910 line:82%
...who's perfect for this job.

485
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.990 line:82%
Thank you for coming, Sameer.

486
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.700 line:82%
Not at all, sir, please... I mean...

487
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:50.620 line:82%
I wanted to see for myself that
if it was really was you who called.

488
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.510 line:82%
I'm just a big fan, sir.

489
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.200 line:82%
"Sir?"

490
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.870 line:82%
"Sir" sounds too honest. Call me Don.

491
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:00.640 line:82%
Sit, I have a job for you.

492
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:08.580 line:82%
The security system at the DZB's currency
center is controlled by a master computer.

493
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.580 line:82%
I want you to hack into this computer
so that this entire system...

494
00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:14.950 line:82%
...is completely under my control.

495
00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.620 line:82%
I'm really sorry, sir... Don... but

496
00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:25.730 line:82%
I can't do this job.

497
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:26.990 line:82%
Really?

498
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.590 line:82%
Is this the Sameer Ali, who at 17,
hacked into the Tokyo Stock Exchange,

499
00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.040 line:82%
stole 1.5 million dollars,

500
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.800 line:82%
and then donated it anonymously
to Save the Oceans foundation?

501
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.990 line:82%
There's no proof that I did it.

502
00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.410 line:82%
And if there's no proof,
there's no criminal.

503
00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:43.490 line:82%
Isn't that right?

504
00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:45.490 line:82%
Touché.

505
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.390 line:82%
By the way, you've been quite good
for the last three years.

506
00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.700 line:82%
I'm sure love has something to do with it.

507
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:56.370 line:82%
Actually tell me,
I... I like love stories.

508
00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:01.280 line:82%
She is a... she's very special.

509
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:03.290 line:82%
I am sure she is.

510
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:06.240 line:82%
But so is your talent, Sameer.

511
00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.580 line:82%
If you didn't use it at the right time,

512
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.840 line:82%
then what's the use?

513
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:14.610 line:82%
I can't.

514
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:21.490 line:82%
I'd promised Yana that I won't do
anything illegal anymore.

515
00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.660 line:82%
If there's no proof,

516
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.620 line:82%
there's no criminal, right?

517
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.450 line:82%
Hey.

518
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.160 line:82%
Where were you?

519
00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.170 line:82%
I had the interview, remember?

520
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.160 line:82%
Oh, yeah. How did it go?

521
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.330 line:82%
I got the job, Yana.

522
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:02.990 line:82%
That's great, Sam.

523
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.700 line:82%
How are you feeling?

524
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:10.240 line:82%
I feel good.

525
00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:13.460 line:82%
A little bit tired... but good.

526
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.540 line:82%
He's not troubling you too much, is he?

527
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.460 line:82%
No. He's very well-behaved.

528
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:46.640 line:82%
Listen, I may have to go
away for a couple of weeks.

529
00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.410 line:82%
There's a software expo in Amsterdam.

530
00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.160 line:82%
My love, it's not
what you're thinking it is.

531
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:56.980 line:82%
I'm done with that life.

532
00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.140 line:82%
What's important to me
is you and the baby and...

533
00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.200 line:82%
...and I won't let anything
come between us.

534
00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:20.620 line:82%
1:18 p.m.

535
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:22.600 line:82%
There are two people in the car.

536
00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.210 line:82%
Exactly six minutes later...

537
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:29.550 line:82%
...here, look carefully.

538
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.670 line:82%
Just one.

539
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.720 line:82%
That means the man who was with Don,

540
00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:39.540 line:82%
got off somewhere between
Tiergarten Strasse

541
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:43.160 line:82%
and 17th Juli Strasse

542
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:47.040 line:82%
Maybe someone saw him get out of the car.

543
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.650 line:82%
Yes. It's possible.

544
00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.990 line:82%
I'll talk to Berkel.

545
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.470 line:82%
If there's a witness, we'll find him.

546
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.170 line:82%
Hello?

547
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:06.700 line:82%
Diwan, I'm sure you must be happy
with my punctuality.

548
00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.620 line:82%
What have you decided?

549
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.850 line:82%
I'm willing to give you
that information.

550
00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:16.490 line:82%
Good. Tomorrow morning at eight,
in front of the Berlin Cathedral.

551
00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.700 line:82%
Now what?

552
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:24.670 line:82%
Now, you'll do exactly what he wants.

553
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.240 line:82%
What do you mean?

554
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:29.910 line:82%
I can't give him that information!

555
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.600 line:82%
Then give him fake information.

556
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.540 line:82%
By the time Don figures that out,

557
00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.270 line:82%
he'll be dead, Mr. Diwan.

558
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:54.550 line:82%
Hello?

559
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:57.830 line:82%
A sightseeing bus is coming
in your direction to your left.

560
00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.200 line:82%
I see it.

561
00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.550 line:82%
The bus will stop in front of you.

562
00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:03.950 line:82%
Come to the upper deck.

563
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:13.290 line:82%
Let's go.

564
00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.790 line:82%
Thanks, Sameer.

565
00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:37.410 line:82%
Everything you've asked for
is in these discs.

566
00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:45.540 line:82%
The blueprints of the currency center,
security protocols,

567
00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.460 line:82%
all access pass keys
of the building, everything.

568
00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.310 line:82%
And the safe that has those plates?

569
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:53.580 line:82%
That... safe...

570
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:56.010 line:82%
...is in the building's underground vault.

571
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.910 line:82%
It can only be opened by a passkey

572
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.950 line:82%
which is in the custody of the center's
chief technician, Dr. Schneider.

573
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:04.410 line:82%
Anything else?

574
00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.680 line:82%
Apart from the passkey, to open the safe,

575
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.730 line:82%
you also need Dr. Schneider's
fingerprints and voice match.

576
00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.160 line:82%
Look.

577
00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:24.290 line:82%
Honestly, you've got to trust me.
I'm telling you the truth.

578
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.660 line:82%
You have beautiful eyes.

579
00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:28.870 line:82%
I trust you.

580
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.490 line:82%
Keep this phone with you.

581
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.970 line:82%
You have a room booked
at the Hotel le Rome.

582
00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.540 line:82%
Stay there until my next call.

583
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:43.460 line:82%
But what about the tape and documents
that you were to give me?

584
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.740 line:82%
Relax, Diwan.

585
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:49.470 line:82%
You'll get all... that you deserve.

586
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.330 line:82%
Take the stairs.

587
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.790 line:82%
Karl, you stay here.

588
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:40.830 line:82%
Hey!

589
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:16.960 line:82%
You!

590
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.240 line:82%
Jabbar.

591
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:30.830 line:82%
Don may not ask how his friends are doing

592
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:34.330 line:82%
but he always knows
what his enemies are up to.

593
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.240 line:82%
Someone is following you, sir.

594
01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:51.450 line:82%
Thanks, Sameer.

595
01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:54.650 line:82%
You want this, right?

596
01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.290 line:82%
No, Don.

597
01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:59.360 line:82%
I want to kill you.

598
01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.720 line:82%
This will be a big problem.

599
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:08.040 line:82%
You see, it suits me if I am alive.

600
01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.240 line:82%
I think you'll have to change
your intention.

601
01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:15.950 line:82%
Let's do this.

602
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:17.570 line:82%
Join me.

603
01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:21.790 line:82%
Whatever money Diwan
has promised you to kill me

604
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:23.470 line:82%
I'll give you three times more.

605
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:26.940 line:82%
Think about it.

606
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.080 line:82%
I don't want to put you...

607
01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.450 line:82%
...under any pressure.

608
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:44.090 line:82%
We found someone.

609
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:45.220 line:82%
That's great.

610
01:04:45.330 --> 01:04:47.720 line:82%
Someone at the station
has identified Don's car.

611
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.850 line:82%
And he also got a good look
at the person who got out.

612
01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.140 line:82%
Super. Where is he?

613
01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.390 line:82%
With the sketch artist.

614
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.790 line:82%
Let me know when the sketch is complete.

615
01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.410 line:82%
All right then. Arjun!

616
01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:00.320 line:82%
Good job.

617
01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.140 line:82%
Thanks.

618
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:21.540 line:82%
Don.

619
01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:26.920 line:82%
You've made a big mistake
by including Jabbar in our plan.

620
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.490 line:82%
-Really?
-Really.

621
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.580 line:82%
Have you forgotten
that he wants to kill you?

622
01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:37.660 line:82%
Don's enemies should always
remember that Don never forgets.

623
01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:41.080 line:82%
And as far as my mistake
is concerned, remember this...

624
01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:45.310 line:82%
...this Abdul Jabbar will be
our ticket to escape from DZB.

625
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:46.430 line:82%
Meaning?

626
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:51.070 line:82%
I mean the plan we've hatched to get us
safely out of the building

627
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:57.360 line:82%
will be a success only if we sacrifice
Abdul Jabbar and his goons.

628
01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.070 line:82%
Yeah.

629
01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.450 line:82%
Hello, sweetheart.

630
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.690 line:82%
Is he dead?

631
01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:24.900 line:82%
No, but you are.

632
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:27.300 line:82%
Don?

633
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:31.340 line:82%
Diwan, you gave me a blank disc,
I can think of it as your stupidity

634
01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.720 line:82%
but along with that,
you arranged for my death...

635
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.960 line:82%
what should I think of that?

636
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:37.490 line:82%
Please, Don.

637
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:39.050 line:82%
Don, please.

638
01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.510 line:82%
Please forgive me, Don.

639
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.970 line:82%
Look, I made a really big mistake.
I'll give you...

640
01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:45.210 line:82%
-Yes,
-...whatever you want, anything you want.

641
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:46.620 line:82%
Where is the information?

642
01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:50.340 line:82%
It's right here, Don.
It's with me in this room.

643
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.440 line:82%
-Open the door.
-What?

644
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.710 line:82%
Knock, knock.

645
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.780 line:82%
Sir, did you order room service?

646
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.410 line:82%
Say, "yes."

647
01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.660 line:82%
Yes, I... I ordered room service.

648
01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:16.840 line:82%
But you...

649
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:18.580 line:82%
Give her the information.

650
01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.600 line:82%
I've got it.

651
01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:39.240 line:82%
As a penalty, you'll have to do
one more thing for me, Diwan.

652
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:41.100 line:82%
Wait.

653
01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.240 line:82%
Wait for my call.

654
01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:46.480 line:82%
That's him.

655
01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:53.490 line:82%
I've seen him somewhere.

656
01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:59.110 line:82%
Where...

657
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:04.320 line:82%
He was at the charity fund raiser.

658
01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:07.790 line:82%
His name... the guest of honor...

659
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.660 line:82%
-What's his name?
-J.K. Diwan.

660
01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:12.010 line:82%
-That's it.
-The Vice President of the DZB.

661
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.140 line:82%
Isn't it?

662
01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.450 line:82%
Yeah, you are right.

663
01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.870 line:82%
But what was he doing
in the car with Don?

664
01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.370 line:82%
That's what we need to find out.

665
01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:38.210 line:82%
Okay.

666
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:42.220 line:82%
So, this building has the best
security system in the world.

667
01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:45.770 line:82%
But obviously, that's not breaking news.

668
01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:48.279 line:82%
Can you control their computers or not?

669
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.840 line:82%
Now, you've trusted me so much,
even I am duty-bound to you.

670
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.250 line:82%
I can control everything
except the underground vault.

671
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:59.370 line:82%
Why not the vault?

672
01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.749 line:82%
Because the vault isn't linked
to the master computer.

673
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.120 line:82%
Its controls are there in that room.

674
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.359 line:82%
Even its electric supply is different
from the rest of the building.

675
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.960 line:82%
Okay. What is, is.

676
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.729 line:82%
We'll take care of the vault.

677
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:19.290 line:82%
Sir?

678
01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.130 line:82%
Yeah?

679
01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.960 line:82%
Look...

680
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.910 line:82%
I don't mean to demoralize anyone but...

681
01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.810 line:82%
it is important that we understand this...

682
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.448 line:82%
...that this job is extremely difficult.

683
01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:38.920 line:82%
As soon as you enter DZB,
there's a security check-point.

684
01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.340 line:82%
Baggage x-ray, metal detectors.

685
01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:44.590 line:82%
At this point and a little ahead
in the lobby, there are CCTV cameras

686
01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:48.920 line:82%
which are monitored round the clock
by DZB's security guards.

687
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.660 line:82%
There's a door to enter
the vault from the ground level.

688
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:57.380 line:82%
Now this door can be controlled
by a password.

689
01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.950 line:82%
The stairs inside lead
to the underground vault.

690
01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.300 line:82%
There is a metal gate manned by two
security guards on the other side

691
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.920 line:82%
who are always present.

692
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:08.890 line:82%
If you're able to get past them
without claiming your life insurance,

693
01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:11.790 line:82%
then there's the first door
to the printing chamber.

694
01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:14.800 line:82%
Those security guards
should have the key to that.

695
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:16.630 line:82%
The next door is the problem.

696
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:18.590 line:82%
The main vault door.

697
01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:21.250 line:82%
This entire chamber
is made of solid steel.

698
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:26.210 line:82%
Now the emergency procedure is to lock
the door and smash the controls.

699
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:29.530 line:82%
Meaning, it's impossible
to open it normally.

700
01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.500 line:82%
All right, we'll blow it up.

701
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.420 line:82%
No. Please don't even think of that.

702
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.700 line:82%
Why not?

703
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:39.880 line:82%
Because if you try to open it
through any other way,

704
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.170 line:82%
two things will happen.

705
01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.550 line:82%
First thing.

706
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.750 line:82%
A chemical gas will release
automatically into the chamber.

707
01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:50.140 line:82%
The gas isn't lethal but it can
make a person unconscious for 12 hours.

708
01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.340 line:82%
And the second thing?

709
01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:55.860 line:82%
Between the vault door and the safe,
there's a 20 feet long passage.

710
01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:59.270 line:82%
Now the floor of this passage
is installed with a security system

711
01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:01.610 line:82%
that is activated
by the slightest pressure.

712
01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.040 line:82%
And what happens
if this system is activated?

713
01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.840 line:82%
I don't know, sir... but...

714
01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:12.340 line:82%
...if I were you, I wouldn't make
the mistake of breathing it in.

715
01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:39.500 line:82%
Karl, Jabbar and his team of five,
they will wait here.

716
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:43.910 line:82%
Two of you go up and wait for us
on the fifth floor by this window.

717
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:49.630 line:82%
Jabbar, explosives, guns and ammunition,
you'll take care of them.

718
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:53.540 line:82%
There is no night

719
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:57.170 line:82%
Nor there is a day here

720
01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.300 line:82%
There's darkness here

721
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:02.310 line:82%
This is Dr. Schneider.

722
01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:03.930 line:82%
I want his finger prints.

723
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:07.700 line:82%
There's smoke

724
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:11.560 line:82%
Eyes are betrayed

725
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:16.100 line:82%
This no one knows

726
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:20.800 line:82%
Wonder what's here and isn't

727
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.350 line:82%
Good afternoon, this is Detective Baruah
from Interpol.

728
01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.330 line:82%
May I speak with Dr. Schneider please?

729
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:28.590 line:82%
-Good afternoon.
-Dr. Schneider?

730
01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.750 line:82%
-I'm Diedrich Schneider. Come right in.
-Thank you.

731
01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:34.670 line:82%
There are many fake ones
like this out on the street.

732
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:37.060 line:82%
Could I have the test results
by say, Tuesday?

733
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.630 line:82%
You can get it by tomorrow, if you want...

734
01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:40.970 line:82%
No, Tuesday is just fine.

735
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.690 line:82%
-All right.
-Thank you, Dr. Schneider.

736
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:43.880 line:82%
You're very welcome.

737
01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:51.200 line:82%
-Here you go.
-Thank you so much.

Don, what's the escape plan from DZB?

750
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.870 line:82%
There's a service exit in the basement.

751
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.500 line:82%
Ayesha will wait for us in a police van.

752
01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.960 line:82%
We'll escape in that van,
without any drama.

753
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:15.460 line:82%
That's it?

754
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:20.880 line:82%
Yeah.

755
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:22.590 line:82%
That's it.

756
01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:26.250 line:82%
Why? Do you have a better plan?

757
01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:29.920 line:82%
No?

758
01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:33.630 line:82%
I thought so.

759
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.590 line:82%
Then I guess we'll have
to make do with my plan.

760
01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:01.880 line:82%
Hello? Diwan.

761
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.540 line:82%
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

762
01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:10.710 line:82%
Behind the Paul Loebe house.

763
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:13.500 line:82%
And please, Diwan,

764
01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:15.920 line:82%
make it on time.

765
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:26.590 line:82%
Nothing... can stop me now.

766
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.670 line:82%
I know Don really well.

767
01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:38.000 line:82%
He can bite you, me

768
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.420 line:82%
or anyone else for his gain.

769
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:43.840 line:82%
Really?

770
01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.420 line:82%
Then what are you doing in his snake pit?

771
01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.340 line:82%
Me?

772
01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:53.960 line:82%
Just wanted to know his plan.

773
01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.590 line:82%
I won't make the mistake of trusting him
again and quite frankly, Jabbar,

774
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:01.790 line:82%
neither should you.

775
01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:04.210 line:82%
Why?

776
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.880 line:82%
Because according to Don's exit plan,

777
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.920 line:82%
you won't get out of there alive.

778
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:20.960 line:82%
Don won't leave this place alive!

779
01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.670 line:82%
Jabbar, calm down.

780
01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:25.150 line:82%
Not now.

781
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:26.960 line:82%
After we get the plates.

782
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:31.290 line:82%
We have to agree that Don's plan is good.

783
01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.290 line:82%
But once we get hold of those plates,

784
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:37.790 line:82%
then imagine...

785
01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.210 line:82%
it will be raining money.

786
01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:44.750 line:82%
And Don?

787
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:49.840 line:82%
By the time the cops find Don's corpse
somewhere in a corner of that building,

788
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:54.460 line:82%
we would've escaped through
the service exit as he has planned.

789
01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.250 line:82%
That's it.

790
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:09.790 line:82%
Hey.

791
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:10.960 line:82%
Hey.

792
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:12.670 line:82%
How are you?

793
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.040 line:82%
I'm good baby, good.

794
01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:17.390 line:82%
Just miss you.

795
01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.750 line:82%
I miss you, too.

796
01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.000 line:82%
They're working you hard.
You sound tired.

797
01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.540 line:82%
Just a few more days and I'll be back.

798
01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.540 line:82%
I'm really proud of you, Sam.

799
01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:30.160 line:82%
You know I'm doing this for us, right?

800
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:34.500 line:82%
I love you. Please take care of yourself.

801
01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.210 line:82%
And call me, all right?

802
01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.840 line:82%
It's true the face resembles Mr. Diwan,

803
01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:57.710 line:82%
but it's also true that we're relying
only on one man's memory.

804
01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.420 line:82%
I know, sir... but I believe he is right.

805
01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:07.090 line:82%
All right, fix an appointment with him.

806
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.000 line:82%
Thank you, sir.

807
01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:10.270 line:82%
-Roma?
-Yes.

808
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:13.800 line:82%
Remember that J.K. Diwan
is a very respectable person.

809
01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:17.460 line:82%
So, choose the words
of your questions very carefully.

810
01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.980 line:82%
I understand, sir.

811
01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.450 line:82%
-Hello?
-I'm sorry, Diwan.

812
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.340 line:82%
You had to wait so long

813
01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.680 line:82%
and I'll have to reschedule our meeting.

814
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:41.170 line:82%
Go to DZB and wait for my call.

815
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:42.280 line:82%
But...

816
01:20:06.630 --> 01:20:08.900 line:82%
-How was the drive?
-Lots of traffic but it was fine.

817
01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.420 line:82%
I'm sorry.

818
01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.500 line:82%
Hello, DZB.

819
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:53.590 line:82%
Now what?

820
01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.040 line:82%
Now, we record.

821
01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:01.210 line:82%
Good Morning, Mr. Diwan.

822
01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.740 line:82%
Here we go.

823
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.880 line:82%
Sameer, can you hear me?

824
01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:40.840 line:82%
Yes, Don. Loud and clear.

825
01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:42.840 line:82%
Cameras, now.

826
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:44.070 line:82%
Copy that.

827
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.710 line:82%
I'm replacing the live video
with the recording.

828
01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.500 line:82%
Now they'll see what we show them.

829
01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.670 line:82%
-Hello.
-Good afternoon, sir.

830
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.510 line:82%
I have an appointment with Dr. Schneider.

831
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:38.480 line:82%
Oh, yeah. He's expecting you.

832
01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:44.070 line:82%
Good day. ID cards, please.

833
01:22:45.081 --> 01:22:46.250 line:82%
Good day, Interpol.

834
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.230 line:82%
Oh, shit.

835
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:55.750 line:82%
Yeah?

836
01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:58.070 line:82%
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

837
01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:01.690 line:82%
-Who is it?
-Interpol officers Roma and Malik.

838
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:03.750 line:82%
Get out of there as soon as possible.

839
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:05.520 line:82%
Thank you.

840
01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.670 line:82%
Thank you.

841
01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.000 line:82%
He'll see you now on the fourth floor.

842
01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.460 line:82%
Thank you very much.

843
01:23:13.170 --> 01:23:14.170 line:82%
Interpol.

844
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.300 line:82%
-Yes, Patricia?
-Good afternoon, sir.

845
01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:26.440 line:82%
There are some officers here
from Interpol to meet you.

846
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:32.420 line:82%
Send them up, please... in 15 minutes.

847
01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:43.630 line:82%
I have the results of the analysis
on the counterfeit bill you gave me.

848
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:47.560 line:82%
Altogether, there are seven points

849
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:49.700 line:82%
which confirm that it is a fake.

850
01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:53.130 line:82%
If you see the blurring
in the corner of the ink...

851
01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:09.170 line:82%
The third point which clearly confirms
we are holding a fake in our hands...

852
01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:10.790 line:82%
...is the micro print.

853
01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:13.590 line:82%
You see here the real one
and here's the fake one.

854
01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:16.540 line:82%
In the real note, the micro print...

855
01:24:18.710 --> 01:24:20.500 line:82%
There's a ladder to your left.

856
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:22.960 line:82%
There's the elevator shaft's
ventilation duct above.

857
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:42.420 line:82%
Excuse me.

858
01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:45.270 line:82%
Mr. Diwan will meet you now.

859
01:25:10.770 --> 01:25:13.500 line:82%
I hope it crashes after I get off.

860
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.590 line:82%
Bye.

861
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:40.700 line:82%
Package one in position.

862
01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:48.500 line:82%
Sam, get ready to stop
the elevator when I tell you to.

863
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:51.790 line:82%
Now.

864
01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:57.290 line:82%
Sir, button.

865
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:24.100 line:82%
The doorman at your apartment told us

866
01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:27.570 line:82%
that on 15th morning,
you left your apartment at 11:00 a.m.

867
01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:30.960 line:82%
and you returned at 2:30 p.m.
in the afternoon. Is that right?

868
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:33.210 line:82%
The 15th...

869
01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.170 line:82%
Let me see.

870
01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:37.430 line:82%
Victor, where were we on the 15th?

871
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:39.200 line:82%
Mrs. Bergman's fund-raiser, sir.

872
01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.110 line:82%
-And what time did we return home?
-1:30 p.m, sir.

873
01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:44.420 line:82%
Thank you.

874
01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.340 line:82%
It seems my doorman's
memory is a bit weak.

875
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.540 line:82%
Victor maintains a record
of my every movement

876
01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:54.150 line:82%
and if he's saying I came home
at 1:30, then that's the case.

877
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:57.760 line:82%
Of course. Thank you.

878
01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:00.460 line:82%
No, not at all. You're most welcome.

879
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.090 line:82%
If I can help you guys more, please,

880
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:06.710 line:82%
don't hesitate in getting
in touch with me.

881
01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:10.710 line:82%
As you can see here,
and on this fake one

882
01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:15.210 line:82%
and as you see,
it is the less obvious point...

883
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.250 line:82%
...if it comes to faking a note.

884
01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:36.890 line:82%
Boom.

885
01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.880 line:82%
We have to get you out right now, sir!

886
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.290 line:82%
All right, quickly. Get out.

887
01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:08.920 line:82%
-Move it.
-Lock the vault immediately.

888
01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.000 line:82%
No idea where it came from.

889
01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.790 line:82%
Shut up.

890
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:34.810 line:82%
Let me make some calls
and find out what's going on.

891
01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.580 line:82%
Come on, come on.

892
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:35.040 line:82%
Why are the gates being shut?

893
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:46.630 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Okay.

894
01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:32.500 line:82%
Open the gate.

895
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.790 line:82%
We are in the vault. Get the hostages.

896
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.920 line:82%
Copy that.

897
01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:55.000 line:82%
Go on, quickly.

898
01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:56.840 line:82%
Now! Move it.

899
01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:30.090 line:82%
Sam, it's too bright in the building.

900
01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:32.290 line:82%
-Do something, will you?
-Copy that.

901
01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:53.960 line:82%
You don't understand. I'm answerable
to the German government and its people.

902
01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.260 line:82%
Please, I must stay.

903
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:56.390 line:82%
Hello?

904
01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.920 line:82%
Good evening, Mr. Malik.

905
01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:00.000 line:82%
Don?

906
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:01.840 line:82%
It's Don!

907
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:04.840 line:82%
Give the phone to Roma, please.

908
01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.630 line:82%
How do you know that she...

909
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:09.590 line:82%
Oh, my god.

910
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:13.080 line:82%
He won't come here today, Mr. Malik.

911
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:14.970 line:82%
He's in the building.

912
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:17.060 line:82%
Give the phone to Roma.

913
01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:18.750 line:82%
He wants to talk to you.

914
01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:22.310 line:82%
Hello?

915
01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.880 line:82%
Roma.

916
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:28.630 line:82%
Until when will you chase me?

917
01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:33.290 line:82%
People might think you still love me.

918
01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:36.500 line:82%
What do you want?

919
01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.250 line:82%
I want to give you guys one last chance.

920
01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.310 line:82%
I want you to drop all charges against me.

921
01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.910 line:82%
Right now, you've seen one explosion.

922
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.490 line:82%
If I want I can set off other
explosions around the building.

923
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:54.670 line:82%
And seeing you guys so close,
is suffocating me.

924
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:57.250 line:82%
So everybody, move back a little, please!

925
01:33:57.630 --> 01:33:58.660 line:82%
What's he saying?

926
01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:01.840 line:82%
If we don't move our men back,
he's going to detonate another explosion.

927
01:34:03.190 --> 01:34:04.220 line:82%
He's bluffing.

928
01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:05.590 line:82%
No, I am not.

929
01:34:06.210 --> 01:34:09.620 line:82%
Tell Commissioner Mueller to take a look
at the fire truck in front of him.

930
01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:14.290 line:82%
Because it will blow up in 30 seconds.

931
01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.550 line:82%
Damn it!

932
01:34:17.630 --> 01:34:19.880 line:82%
Move all your men back.
We have only 30 seconds.

933
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.460 line:82%
Move it, move it.

934
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:02.730 line:82%
-Roma, Roma...
-What?

935
01:35:03.210 --> 01:35:06.750 line:82%
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

936
01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:08.310 line:82%
What do you want?

937
01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:10.250 line:82%
My wild cat...

938
01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:13.790 line:82%
If anybody comes within 100 feet
of this building,

939
01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:17.000 line:82%
then more explosions will happen. Boom.

940
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:19.500 line:82%
Understood?

941
01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.340 line:82%
Yes.

942
01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.000 line:82%
I'm watching all you guys every moment.

943
01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:27.790 line:82%
Specially you. So no tricks, please.

944
01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:30.960 line:82%
And get this damn helicopter to buzz off!

945
01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:33.960 line:82%
It's spoiling the mood, sweetheart.

946
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:36.500 line:82%
Don...

947
01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.960 line:82%
Damn it!

948
01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:54.040 line:82%
The cops are going to be busy outside
designing their next strategy.

949
01:35:56.210 --> 01:35:57.600 line:82%
Are all our men in position?

950
01:35:58.090 --> 01:35:59.090 line:82%
Yes.

951
01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:00.630 line:82%
And the rest of the bombs?

952
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:03.420 line:82%
Exactly where you'd wanted them.

953
01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.130 line:82%
Very good. Let's get to work.

954
01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:58.290 line:82%
The gas will be effective
in the chamber for three minutes.

955
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:00.710 line:82%
The rest is up to you.

956
01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:42.840 line:82%
Dr. Schneider.

957
01:37:48.250 --> 01:37:50.040 line:82%
Sam, password.

958
01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:54.600 line:82%
A-3-6-7-5-U-9.

959
01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.100 line:82%
Alarm activated. Door closing.

960
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:26.840 line:82%
Come on!

961
01:38:27.670 --> 01:38:28.750 line:82%
Get out of there.

962
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:37.420 line:82%
-That was close.
-Yeah!

963
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:38.600 line:82%
Where are the plates?

964
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:41.590 line:82%
Do you think I'd leave without them?

965
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.430 line:82%
All good. Pass me the bag please.

966
01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:49.590 line:82%
Thank you.

967
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:57.080 line:82%
Sam?

968
01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:58.340 line:82%
Yeah.

969
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.070 line:82%
Time to go.

970
01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.170 line:82%
Got it.

971
01:39:13.670 --> 01:39:16.710 line:82%
Remember I told you I can never
forget what you did for me?

972
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.460 line:82%
Even then you trusted me.

973
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.150 line:82%
Plates, please.

974
01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.380 line:82%
Bag.

975
01:39:36.710 --> 01:39:38.130 line:82%
Not very smart, are you?

976
01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:47.540 line:82%
So, you wanted to leave me
behind for dead?

977
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:49.980 line:82%
Death will come, Don.

978
01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.130 line:82%
But not for me... you.

979
01:39:57.090 --> 01:39:59.170 line:82%
Jabbar, think it through.

980
01:39:59.250 --> 01:40:02.670 line:82%
after killing me how will you
get out of this building?

981
01:40:04.210 --> 01:40:05.960 line:82%
-Meaning?
-Meaning...

982
01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:09.060 line:82%
there is neither a service exit
in the basement of this building

983
01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.990 line:82%
nor is Ayesha waiting for us
in a police van.

984
01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.540 line:82%
You see...

985
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:17.250 line:82%
I never did make
an escape plan for you guys.

986
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.210 line:82%
Jabbar! He's lying.

987
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:28.670 line:82%
If he didn't make an escape plan,
then how was he planning on getting out?

988
01:40:29.670 --> 01:40:30.880 line:82%
Vardhaan...

989
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:34.150 line:82%
perhaps you weren't paying attention
to what I said.

990
01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.000 line:82%
I didn't make an escape plan...
for you guys.

991
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:44.960 line:82%
But how will you get away from us?

992
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.420 line:82%
Remember, Sameer had said

993
01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:50.430 line:82%
that he couldn't control
the electricity to this vault?

994
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.560 line:82%
He was lying.

995
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:59.420 line:82%
Hey! What are you doing?

996
01:40:59.510 --> 01:41:02.490 line:82%
Nothing. Hey... wait.

997
01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:06.040 line:82%
Karl? Karl?

998
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:20.420 line:82%
Shocking behavior, dude!

999
01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:32.420 line:82%
Find Don! Go!

1000
01:41:34.590 --> 01:41:36.180 line:82%
Perfect timing, Sam.

1001
01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:37.850 line:82%
Thanks.

1002
01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.380 line:82%
See you outside. Switching off.

1003
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:56.170 line:82%
Could I have this couriered
urgently, please.

1004
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:05.130 line:82%
Hello, officer.

1005
01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:07.340 line:82%
Listen to me very carefully.

1006
01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:34.000 line:82%
So, ready to go?

1007
01:44:35.170 --> 01:44:36.340 line:82%
Yeah.

1008
01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:38.650 line:82%
Ready.

1009
01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.130 line:82%
Thanks.

1010
01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.040 line:82%
Drop the gun.

1011
01:44:48.130 --> 01:44:50.210 line:82%
I said, drop the gun!

1012
01:44:52.210 --> 01:44:53.750 line:82%
Drop the gun!

1013
01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.840 line:82%
Hands up!

1014
01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:12.090 line:82%
You're under arrest, Don!

1015
01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:13.560 line:82%
You got me.

1016
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:15.490 line:82%
I did.

1017
01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.250 line:82%
Cuffs.

1018
01:45:20.170 --> 01:45:21.630 line:82%
Hands behind you.

1019
01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:27.670 line:82%
Kinky.

1020
01:45:30.130 --> 01:45:31.750 line:82%
Liked it?

1021
01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:34.010 line:82%
Then get used to it.

1022
01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:38.750 line:82%
It's over, Don.

1023
01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:42.540 line:82%
Where are your other partners?

1024
01:45:43.090 --> 01:45:45.920 line:82%
If you want, you can search my pockets.

1025
01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:47.760 line:82%
Where are they?

1026
01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:51.570 line:82%
They aren't my partners
anymore, Mr. Malik.

1027
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:52.960 line:82%
What does that mean?

1028
01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:59.090 line:82%
I mean...
Vardhaan controls them now, not me.

1029
01:46:02.290 --> 01:46:03.870 line:82%
What? Vardhaan is in the building?

1030
01:46:04.290 --> 01:46:06.460 line:82%
Vardhaan, Abdul Jabbar and his men.

1031
01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:09.970 line:82%
They are very dangerous.

1032
01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.900 line:82%
Be careful.

1033
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.750 line:82%
Come on.

1034
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:20.650 line:82%
So, the heart overcome the mind.

1035
01:46:21.090 --> 01:46:22.250 line:82%
Very sad.

1036
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:25.880 line:82%
Just had a momentary lapse of judgment.

1037
01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:29.390 line:82%
-I'm not like you...
-Oh, yes.

1038
01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.790 line:82%
You're not like me.

1039
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:34.000 line:82%
Because I'm going to lead a long life.

1040
01:46:34.090 --> 01:46:36.170 line:82%
But you and Yana have a different future.

1041
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:39.000 line:82%
Stop it! Stop it! Take him away.

1042
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:41.420 line:82%
Stay!

1043
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.880 line:82%
I'd like to speak
with the officer-in-charge.

1044
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:54.920 line:82%
Vardhaan.

1045
01:46:55.730 --> 01:46:57.670 line:82%
It's coming from inside the building, sir.

1046
01:46:58.380 --> 01:46:59.380 line:82%
Give it to me.

1047
01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:01.750 line:82%
Detective Malik here.

1048
01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:03.880 line:82%
Hello, Malik.

1049
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:06.100 line:82%
Vardhaan.

1050
01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:08.630 line:82%
You'd better surrender.

1051
01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:12.870 line:82%
Why? I have 25 of DZB's staff as hostage.

1052
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:17.370 line:82%
And you know I won't hesitate
in killing them.

1053
01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.350 line:82%
You are already in trouble,
don't try anything stupid.

1054
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:26.000 line:82%
No, no. You'll be stupid if you
don't listen to me carefully.

1055
01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:30.050 line:82%
In two hours I need a helicopter
that will take us to the airport.

1056
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:32.670 line:82%
There, I need a plane waiting for us.

1057
01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:37.630 line:82%
When we reach our destination,
I will set the hostages free.

1058
01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:38.840 line:82%
Is that clear, Malik?

1059
01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:41.500 line:82%
What you're asking for, it's not possible.

1060
01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:43.790 line:82%
Really?

1061
01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:46.540 line:82%
Jabbar.

1062
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:54.040 line:82%
Vardhaan!

1063
01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.170 line:82%
You hear that?

1064
01:47:57.610 --> 01:48:02.520 line:82%
If mere firing into the air does that,
imagine if I actually shoot...

1065
01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:05.590 line:82%
then what will happen to them.
Two hours.

1066
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.340 line:82%
Do you know how Don
came out of the building?

1067
01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:21.460 line:82%
No, I'm really sorry. He only told me
about getting out of the vault.

1068
01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.040 line:82%
What was he doing in the vault?

1069
01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:35.040 line:82%
So, Sameer told you guys everything.

1070
01:48:35.110 --> 01:48:36.840 line:82%
Answer my question.

1071
01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:38.540 line:82%
Where are the plates?

1072
01:48:39.250 --> 01:48:40.710 line:82%
Vardhaan has the plates.

1073
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000 line:82%
How did you get out of the building?

1074
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:50.100 line:82%
Answer my question, Don!

1075
01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.110 line:82%
Why should I tell you?

1076
01:48:52.190 --> 01:48:56.170 line:82%
Do you know how many innocent people
can die because of you?

1077
01:48:57.250 --> 01:48:59.750 line:82%
I regret all this is happening, Mr. Malik.

1078
01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:04.710 line:82%
But if you want my help, then I want
something in return, too.

1079
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.890 line:82%
You are in no position to negotiate.

1080
01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:14.040 line:82%
Well, in that case...
can I talk to Mr. Diwan once?

1081
01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:17.570 line:82%
Why?

1082
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:23.460 line:82%
Perhaps he can understand
my position better than you.

1083
01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:30.110 line:82%
It's quite simple.

1084
01:49:30.190 --> 01:49:33.310 line:82%
If I go to prison,
so will you and Fabian Kohl.

1085
01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:34.670 line:82%
Look, you can't...

1086
01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:42.730 line:82%
Please. Look, we had a deal.
Whatever you asked, I delivered.

1087
01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:45.340 line:82%
I want one last thing.

1088
01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.170 line:82%
Promise.

1089
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:56.630 line:82%
He will help us.

1090
01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:01.460 line:82%
Mr. Diwan has promised me
immunity here in Germany.

1091
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:05.420 line:82%
And I don't know why, I trust him.

1092
01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:13.130 line:82%
In return, I'm ready to help you defuse
the bombs and free the hostages.

1093
01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.710 line:82%
What about the plates?

1094
01:50:15.710 --> 01:50:17.780 line:82%
Don't worry. You'll get the plates back.

1095
01:50:18.670 --> 01:50:20.460 line:82%
Roma.

1096
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:22.420 line:82%
What?

1097
01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:28.340 line:82%
So that you believe this
change of heart isn't an act,

1098
01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:31.290 line:82%
I'm ready to deliver the disc to the cops.

1099
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:36.460 line:82%
With that, you can put a legal period

1100
01:50:37.150 --> 01:50:39.920 line:82%
in the story of the European
and Asian drug trade.

1101
01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:42.120 line:82%
Really?

1102
01:50:48.090 --> 01:50:49.590 line:82%
Roma, it's strange...

1103
01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.340 line:82%
after so many years, life has
brought us together again.

1104
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:55.710 line:82%
We can never be together.

1105
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:58.540 line:82%
You never know.

1106
01:51:01.170 --> 01:51:06.000 line:82%
Perhaps someday you'll realize that
I'm no longer the Don that you despise.

1107
01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:11.340 line:82%
A dog may straighten its tail,
but it'll still remain a dog.

1108
01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:17.130 line:82%
That's why I'm not able
to forget you, my wild cat.

1109
01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:20.040 line:82%
What? Are you going to shoot me?

1110
01:51:21.630 --> 01:51:22.920 line:82%
Don't tempt me.

1111
01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:28.960 line:82%
Let's go.

1112
01:51:30.710 --> 01:51:33.570 line:82%
Roma, please. Is it necessary
for you to go inside?

1113
01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:35.170 line:82%
-Yes, it is.
-Why?

1114
01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:38.880 line:82%
-The S.E.K unit can do the job.
-Will you just relax?

1115
01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:42.710 line:82%
Stay with Mr. Malik here, got it?

1116
01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:47.140 line:82%
If anything happens to her, I will...

1117
01:51:48.630 --> 01:51:51.130 line:82%
You... you what?

1118
01:51:58.170 --> 01:52:00.710 line:82%
Your team worries a lot about each other.

1119
01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:03.590 line:82%
Sweet.

1120
01:52:10.130 --> 01:52:12.210 line:82%
Gentlemen, enjoy the swim.

1121
01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:24.090 line:82%
-Did you find out about Don?
-Forget him.

1122
01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:28.000 line:82%
If he wants to live,
he won't come back.

1123
01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.010 line:82%
Okay. Which way now?

1124
01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:35.920 line:82%
Follow me.

1125
01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.960 line:82%
So, what's the story
between you and Arjun?

1126
01:52:49.170 --> 01:52:50.710 line:82%
It doesn't concern you.

1127
01:52:51.250 --> 01:52:54.670 line:82%
Just wanted to know what's happening
in your life. Is that wrong?

1128
01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:58.750 line:82%
You are incapable of thinking
about anyone else, except yourself.

1129
01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.880 line:82%
Except you.

1130
01:53:12.630 --> 01:53:14.460 line:82%
You guys take cover behind the door.

1131
01:53:17.130 --> 01:53:19.040 line:82%
Herman, go.

1132
01:53:39.090 --> 01:53:40.170 line:82%
Roma.

1133
01:53:41.670 --> 01:53:42.880 line:82%
What?

1134
01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:47.790 line:82%
When I said I was ready
to give that information to the police,

1135
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:50.250 line:82%
how did you feel?

1136
01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:00.380 line:82%
Your words don't effect me.

1137
01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:04.710 line:82%
I know. But still,
you were surprised I did that.

1138
01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:10.840 line:82%
Roma, the fact is I'm tired of this life.

1139
01:54:11.710 --> 01:54:14.710 line:82%
I've started loathing people
like Vardhaan and Coogan.

1140
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:19.710 line:82%
I want to be free from them
and the law. I...

1141
01:54:20.670 --> 01:54:22.550 line:82%
I want to be a free man.

1142
01:54:26.130 --> 01:54:27.710 line:82%
Please...

1143
01:54:29.590 --> 01:54:31.130 line:82%
forgive me, Roma.

1144
01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.960 line:82%
Come on, we're clear.

1145
01:54:55.210 --> 01:54:56.630 line:82%
Wait, Roma.

1146
01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.830 line:82%
There are security cameras outside.

1147
01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:02.000 line:82%
Jabbar's men can see everything
in the surveillance room.

1148
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.290 line:82%
So, this was your plan?

1149
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:08.090 line:82%
I had planted one bomb
in the surveillance room

1150
01:55:08.170 --> 01:55:11.460 line:82%
so that we could destroy all
video recordings as we escaped.

1151
01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:31.140 line:82%
Karl! Check where the blast happened.

1152
01:55:31.230 --> 01:55:32.700 line:82%
All positions, report in.

1153
01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:34.750 line:82%
Position one, all clear.

1154
01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.280 line:82%
Position two, all clear.

1155
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:39.340 line:82%
Position three, come in.

1156
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:42.000 line:82%
Position three!

1157
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.340 line:82%
Ladies first.

1158
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.420 line:82%
Position three!

1159
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:56.090 line:82%
No reply from
the surveillance room, Jabbar.

1160
01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:00.550 line:82%
Don.

1161
01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:03.880 line:82%
Karl.

1162
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:05.750 line:82%
Bring me his head.

1163
01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:26.290 line:82%
Move!

1164
01:58:50.090 --> 01:58:51.290 line:82%
You're welcome.

1165
01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:55.880 line:82%
You are shot.

1166
01:58:56.410 --> 01:58:57.440 line:82%
Just grazed.

1167
01:58:58.300 --> 01:58:59.300 line:82%
Sorry.

1168
01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:00.380 line:82%
You okay?

1169
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:02.340 line:82%
We're good.

1170
01:59:03.570 --> 01:59:05.420 line:82%
Stay down. I'm going to check
on the others.

1171
01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:09.140 line:82%
May I ask you something?

1172
01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.250 line:82%
Yeah.

1173
01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:13.530 line:82%
What's the story between you and Arjun?

1174
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:16.390 line:82%
He likes you?

1175
01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:23.000 line:82%
lt's not difficult to understand
why he likes you.

1176
01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:27.130 line:82%
And you... do you like him?

1177
01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:31.880 line:82%
I don't need to tell you anything.

1178
01:59:33.770 --> 01:59:34.880 line:82%
You know what I think?

1179
01:59:36.450 --> 01:59:37.590 line:82%
You don't like him.

1180
01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.130 line:82%
Because you still love me.

1181
01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:44.460 line:82%
I don't love you.

1182
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:46.540 line:82%
Just checking.

1183
01:59:47.670 --> 01:59:50.590 line:82%
Herman's dead.
And the bomb is still armed.

1184
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:52.630 line:82%
Karl, can you hear me?

1185
01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:54.710 line:82%
Karl, come in.

1186
01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:57.340 line:82%
Ulrich, come in... goddammit!

1187
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.090 line:82%
Something's wrong.

1188
02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:03.920 line:82%
Jabbar, detonate rest of the bombs.

1189
02:00:04.530 --> 02:00:07.100 line:82%
Let them know what it means to betray us.

1190
02:00:07.170 --> 02:00:08.250 line:82%
Do it!

1191
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:20.050 line:82%
Try the other one.

1192
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:30.530 line:82%
Oops.

1193
02:00:31.630 --> 02:00:33.050 line:82%
It's not working.

1194
02:00:34.050 --> 02:00:36.500 line:82%
Jabbar!

1195
02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:41.280 line:82%
Son of a bitch!

1196
02:00:49.590 --> 02:00:50.650 line:82%
Malik...

1197
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:54.440 line:82%
if the helicopter isn't here
in five minutes

1198
02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.250 line:82%
then we'll shoot this woman.

1199
02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:57.830 line:82%
Vardhaan!

1200
02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:00.930 line:82%
There's still 20 minutes to go
for two hours.

1201
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.040 line:82%
You're lying, Malik!

1202
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:05.550 line:82%
When you see this woman's body
flying off the window

1203
02:01:05.630 --> 02:01:09.960 line:82%
then you'll know we weren't lying.
Get it, Malik?

1204
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:11.630 line:82%
Jabbar, stop.

1205
02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:13.960 line:82%
The cops haven't betrayed you. I have.

1206
02:01:14.670 --> 02:01:16.040 line:82%
Let that woman go.

1207
02:01:16.670 --> 02:01:17.960 line:82%
I'm coming to you.

1208
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:20.280 line:82%
Vardhaan!

1209
02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.740 line:82%
The helicopters have left the airbase.

1210
02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:25.090 line:82%
They will be here in ten minutes.

1211
02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.590 line:82%
Trust me! If you shoot,
then I won't be able to help you.

1212
02:01:32.590 --> 02:01:33.750 line:82%
Ten minutes.

1213
02:01:35.090 --> 02:01:36.170 line:82%
And Don...

1214
02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:40.600 line:82%
come here, right now!

1215
02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:46.670 line:82%
One second.

1216
02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:48.710 line:82%
Philip needs medical help.

1217
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:52.190 line:82%
I think you should stay with him.
I'll going with Don, okay?

1218
02:01:52.290 --> 02:01:54.130 line:82%
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

1219
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:57.330 line:82%
Roma, what are you doing?
It's not safe.

1220
02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.860 line:82%
That woman needs me.

1221
02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:02.510 line:82%
But it's too dangerous.
Vardhaan and Jabbar can do anything.

1222
02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.560 line:82%
It's my duty to help
those hostages. So, come on.

1223
02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.720 line:82%
Please, Roma. Try to understand.

1224
02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.090 line:82%
What if something happens to you?

1225
02:02:16.290 --> 02:02:18.210 line:82%
I'm coming with you and...

1226
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:20.450 line:82%
that's it.

1227
02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:22.250 line:82%
Let's go.

1228
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:33.500 line:82%
Well, well, well.

1229
02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:35.590 line:82%
What a happy reunion.

1230
02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:38.380 line:82%
Hello, Roma.

1231
02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:41.380 line:82%
Now, both of you,
throw your weapons on the floor.

1232
02:02:42.090 --> 02:02:44.090 line:82%
I mean, really. Do I need to spell it out?

1233
02:02:51.610 --> 02:02:53.460 line:82%
Please remove your bullet-proof vests.

1234
02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:02.190 line:82%
Vardhaan, the police is giving
you everything you'd asked for.

1235
02:03:02.770 --> 02:03:05.340 line:82%
In return, at least let the women go.

1236
02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:06.710 line:82%
No, not a chance.

1237
02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:10.210 line:82%
I've realized that in such situations,

1238
02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:13.380 line:82%
women are more useful.

1239
02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:17.170 line:82%
If we must let someone go, then...

1240
02:03:19.130 --> 02:03:20.140 line:82%
...free Don.

1241
02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:22.360 line:82%
-Sorry?
-No, no. Don't be.

1242
02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:27.210 line:82%
I want to kill Don.
Jabbar wants to kill Don.

1243
02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:31.540 line:82%
And I'm sure you won't regret
if he is killed, right?

1244
02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:34.500 line:82%
Right.

1245
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:39.210 line:82%
Give her a gun.

1246
02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:53.790 line:82%
Yeah. Good.

1247
02:03:56.090 --> 02:03:57.190 line:82%
Now...

1248
02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:00.710 line:82%
kill him.

1249
02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:13.210 line:82%
Amazing.

1250
02:04:14.170 --> 02:04:16.420 line:82%
Now, I've seen everything in my life.

1251
02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:20.290 line:82%
What spell have you cast on her, Don?

1252
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:22.880 line:82%
Anyway...

1253
02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:27.750 line:82%
Let's try again.

1254
02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:29.340 line:82%
Jabbar.

1255
02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:33.340 line:82%
If she doesn't shoot Don
by the time I count three...

1256
02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:37.210 line:82%
...shoot her.

1257
02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:43.840 line:82%
One.

1258
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.070 line:82%
Pull the trigger, Roma.

1259
02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:48.540 line:82%
Two.

1260
02:04:49.670 --> 02:04:51.170 line:82%
Shoot me, Roma.

1261
02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:55.670 line:82%
Three.

1262
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:56.870 line:82%
Do it!

1263
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.770 line:82%
So, the fire's burning on both the sides.

1264
02:05:33.490 --> 02:05:34.790 line:82%
You're next, Don.

1265
02:05:36.130 --> 02:05:38.150 line:82%
Vardhaan, perhaps you're forgetting
one thing.

1266
02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:39.270 line:82%
What's that?

1267
02:05:40.170 --> 02:05:43.210 line:82%
Before Don's enemy can
make his first move

1268
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:46.630 line:82%
Don already makes his next move.

1269
02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:21.960 line:82%
Is everybody okay?

1270
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:23.670 line:82%
No, no, no. Not yet.

1271
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:26.090 line:82%
Stay right there. Please.

1272
02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:30.590 line:82%
Mr. Malik?

1273
02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.090 line:82%
Malik here.

1274
02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:35.540 line:82%
Mr. Malik,

1275
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:41.000 line:82%
Jabbar's dead. And you shouldn't have any
issue in taking Vardhaan back to prison.

1276
02:07:42.590 --> 02:07:44.750 line:82%
Plates and hostages are with me.

1277
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:50.650 line:82%
So now, I hope you have
my immunity papers ready.

1278
02:07:53.290 --> 02:07:54.490 line:82%
Papers are ready.

1279
02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:55.880 line:82%
Very good, Mr. Malik.

1280
02:07:57.190 --> 02:07:58.630 line:82%
Send them in.

1281
02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.340 line:82%
With Sameer.

1282
02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:04.250 line:82%
Why Sameer?

1283
02:08:04.710 --> 02:08:08.840 line:82%
Because I want to meet
that traitor for the last time.

1284
02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:36.710 line:82%
She's alive.

1285
02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:39.790 line:82%
Bring the file here.

1286
02:08:50.210 --> 02:08:52.290 line:82%
-Hey!
-Let him go, now!

1287
02:08:53.630 --> 02:08:56.250 line:82%
You better arrange
for a safe hiding place, Sameer.

1288
02:08:56.710 --> 02:08:58.500 line:82%
Because the day I find you,

1289
02:08:59.170 --> 02:09:00.790 line:82%
you'll be dead.

1290
02:09:01.210 --> 02:09:03.580 line:82%
If you want to meet,
you know where I live.

1291
02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:08.420 line:82%
Yes. I know where you live.

1292
02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:10.960 line:82%
Drop the weapon right now!

1293
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:36.540 line:82%
What happened to Roma?

1294
02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.220 line:82%
Yours, I believe.

1295
02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:48.290 line:82%
Take care of her.

1296
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.460 line:82%
Here! Hurry!

1297
02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:04.250 line:82%
Gentlemen, is there anything
else I can do for you?

1298
02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:06.410 line:82%
Where's that disc?

1299
02:10:07.130 --> 02:10:08.710 line:82%
In the bag with the plates.

1300
02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:12.750 line:82%
Can I leave now, sir?

1301
02:10:13.130 --> 02:10:15.510 line:82%
First, we'll confirm that information.

1302
02:10:15.590 --> 02:10:16.920 line:82%
Of course.

1303
02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:21.730 line:82%
By the way... would it take a lot of time?

1304
02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:26.210 line:82%
Take him away.

1305
02:10:27.630 --> 02:10:28.790 line:82%
Good night, everyone.

1306
02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:33.750 line:82%
Thank you.

1307
02:11:16.290 --> 02:11:17.630 line:82%
Check this out.

1308
02:11:21.590 --> 02:11:23.150 line:82%
What about these plates, Mr. Diwan?

1309
02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:24.880 line:82%
I'll take them.

1310
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:28.040 line:82%
They need to be checked
for damages in the lab.

1311
02:11:35.710 --> 02:11:37.600 line:82%
-Is it good?
-Good?

1312
02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.590 line:82%
It's priceless, Mr. Malik.

1313
02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:43.060 line:82%
You want Mr. Kohl to become president,

1314
02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:45.360 line:82%
he will be the president.

1315
02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:47.040 line:82%
That's my responsibility, Mr. Diwan.

1316
02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:48.200 line:82%
Oh, my god.

1317
02:12:07.090 --> 02:12:12.000 line:82%
Remember I'd said... Don's enemies
should always remember

1318
02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:14.880 line:82%
that Don never forgets anything.

1319
02:12:20.170 --> 02:12:23.790 line:82%
Those who set out to kill me,
they themselves have been killed.

1320
02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:26.340 line:82%
Jimmy Coogan, you're under arrest.

1321
02:12:27.250 --> 02:12:30.250 line:82%
Jimmy Coogan and all his partners.

1322
02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:32.250 line:82%
All of them.

1323
02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:37.630 line:82%
The police had to accept
that it was because of me

1324
02:12:38.210 --> 02:12:41.670 line:82%
that Fabian Kohl was exposed.

1325
02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:48.040 line:82%
Vardhaan also got back
to where he belonged.

1326
02:12:52.290 --> 02:12:54.170 line:82%
Now, there's one last thing.

1327
02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.170 line:82%
One last thing remained.

1328
02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:03.630 line:82%
-Yep?
-Package for Mr. Ali.

1329
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:06.170 line:82%
-That's me.
-Please sign here, sir.

1330
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:09.350 line:82%
Here you go.

1331
02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:12.500 line:82%
-Thanks.
-Bye.

1332
02:13:27.670 --> 02:13:29.500 line:82%
-Hello.
-Don.

1333
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:32.790 line:82%
I've sent you a present.

1334
02:13:35.210 --> 02:13:36.610 line:82%
I hope you like it.

1335
02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:30.670 line:82%
I missed you, sweetheart.

1336
02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:39.420 line:82%
Where's he?

1337
02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:41.630 line:82%
He's right here.

1338
02:14:49.090 --> 02:14:53.090 line:82%
When I get out of the DZB,
hand me over to the police.

1339
02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:57.500 line:82%
-Sorry?
-Don't worry.

1340
02:14:58.210 --> 02:14:59.710 line:82%
It's part of the plan.

1341
02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:03.500 line:82%
This disc has all the details
of this business.

1342
02:15:06.250 --> 02:15:09.090 line:82%
Now, listen carefully what you need to do.

1343
02:15:16.090 --> 02:15:17.420 line:82%
Check this out.

1344
02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:24.920 line:82%
The perfect crime.

1345
02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:29.330 line:82%
Plates, please.

1346
02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.120 line:82%
Bag.

1347
02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:05.880 line:82%
-Thanks.
-Bye.

1348
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:11.680 line:82%
The world thinks the real plates
were destroyed in the blast.

1349
02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:15.250 line:82%
But here they are with me.

1350
02:16:40.170 --> 02:16:41.450 line:82%
Now what?

1351
02:16:42.090 --> 02:16:45.330 line:82%
All my enemies are either dead
or in prison.

1352
02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:50.000 line:82%
And the police, too,
can't do anything to me. So, now...

1353
02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:52.880 line:82%
now, I'm a... free man.

1354
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:57.010 line:82%
And Roma?

1355
02:16:58.290 --> 02:17:00.379 line:82%
Why did you have to save her life?

1356
02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:05.420 line:82%
Roma has become a bad habit.

1357
02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:07.710 line:82%
Now, it's difficult to quit her.

1358
02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:11.880 line:82%
Forget about her, sweetheart.

1359
02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:15.660 line:82%
Do you guys have any idea
how rich you two are going to be?

1360
02:17:15.770 --> 02:17:19.380 line:82%
Really. I still can't believe
you got out of there alive.

1361
02:17:23.090 --> 02:17:25.420 line:82%
Always remember one thing.

1362
02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:28.500 line:82%
Catching Don is not only difficult...
