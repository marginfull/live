I mean, it was either
this or juvie hall,

I mean, you just
can't keep moving away

into trouble.

asked for this.

00:15:14.948 --> 00:15:19.019 line:83%
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

if you're gonna live
under my roof,

514

- Why you talking like you
have a choice?

521
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.016 line:83%
There's a guy in there with a
paw that owes me some money.

522

You're in the pickup and
delivery business now.

535
00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:21.172 line:83%
I might call you once
a week or once an hour.

536
00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:24.209 line:83%
I don't care if you're sick as
a dog or in bed with Beyoncé.

537

I call, you show.

538
00:37:26.312 --> 00:37:29.281 line:83%
- Only if you teach me
how to drift.

539
00:37:29.315 --> 00:37:30.949 line:83%
- This ain't a negotiation.

540
00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:33.619 line:83%
- I wasn't negotiating.

What's he doing here?

545
00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:28.039 line:83%
- He's paying me back
for that crumpled beer can
sitting in my garage.

546
00:38:28.073 --> 00:38:28.940 line:83%
- Hope he's not driving.

547

Gaijin.

548
00:38:34.746 --> 00:38:37.115 line:83%
When is your next race?

549
00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.284 line:83%
I'd really like to be there.

550
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:40.218 line:83%

551
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.758 line:83%

You really a badass, cowboy,
or you just talk like one?

552

- You heard me.

553
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.497 line:83%

another car, Han?

'86 Corolla off your hands.

- All right.

556
00:38:59.004 --> 00:39:01.440 line:83%
Put up the '72 Skyline.

- Done.

558
00:39:05.143 --> 00:39:06.812 line:83%
- What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

559
00:39:10.382 --> 00:39:13.318 line:83%
- Get him out of here.

560
00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:15.421 line:83%
We have business to discuss.

561
00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:26.932 line:83%
Your shipment's late.

562
00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:29.635 line:83%
- Since when are you so
worried about the details?

563
00:39:32.571 --> 00:39:36.708 line:83%
- When is the shipment
arriving, Han?

564
00:39:36.742 --> 00:39:39.310 line:83%

566
00:39:59.865 --> 00:40:02.300 line:83%
- Hey, Dad, it's me.

567
00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:05.637 line:83%
I had to stay after school for
some extracurricular activities.

568
00:40:05.671 --> 00:40:11.209 line:83%
So I'll be home
a little later.

569
00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.711 line:83%
Sir.

570
00:40:14.513 --> 00:40:16.948 line:83%
You really need to stop
following me around.

571
00:40:16.982 --> 00:40:19.685 line:83%
- What are you doing here?

572
00:40:19.718 --> 00:40:23.922 line:83%
- I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend
for some drifting lessons.

573
00:40:23.955 --> 00:40:26.257 line:83%
- Trust me.

574
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:28.026 line:83%
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

575
00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:30.028 line:83%
- It's good enough for you.

576
00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:32.631 line:83%
- You don't know
anything about me.

577
00:40:32.664 --> 00:40:34.466 line:83%
- Well, why don't
you think I know?

578
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.134 line:83%
'Cause I'm a gaijin?

579
00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.836 line:83%
An outsider?

580
00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:40.138 line:83%
Let me guess.

581
00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:42.808 line:83%
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

582
00:40:42.841 --> 00:40:45.677 line:83%
Your mama and daddy
was never home.

583
00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:48.714 line:83%
So you walked around
pissed off all the time

584
00:40:48.747 --> 00:40:52.017 line:83%
and now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

585
00:40:55.721 --> 00:40:57.856 line:83%
- Zero for one, cowboy.

586
00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.937 line:83%
- Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

587
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.039 line:83%
like the rest of
the white guys around here?

588
00:41:14.072 --> 00:41:15.774 line:83%
- * Mamacita, oh my God

589
00:41:15.807 --> 00:41:17.676 line:83%
* I think you're on fire

590
00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:19.511 line:83%
* Do you want me to
get you water?

591
00:41:19.545 --> 00:41:22.548 line:83%
- Is everything okay
back there?

592
00:41:22.581 --> 00:41:24.349 line:83%
- I can handle DK.

593
00:41:24.382 --> 00:41:26.451 line:83%
- I thought he's Yakuza.

594
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:29.688 line:83%
- His uncle's Yakuza.

595
00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:35.193 line:83%
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

596
00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.096 line:83%
But I need him.

597
00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:41.933 line:83%
He keeps Uncle Kamata from
poking around too much.

598
00:41:41.967 --> 00:41:44.502 line:83%
- What do you mean?

599
00:41:44.536 --> 00:41:48.707 line:83%
- Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action
from everyone on his turf.

600
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.842 line:83%
We're on his turf.

601
00:41:50.876 --> 00:41:53.344 line:83%
50 percent of something
is better

602
00:41:53.378 --> 00:41:55.614 line:83%
than 100 percent of nothing.

603
00:41:57.415 --> 00:42:00.485 line:83%
- So have you raced DK?

604
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.654 line:83%
Why not?
Is he that good?

605
00:42:02.688 --> 00:42:06.692 line:83%
- What's the point of a race?

606
00:42:06.725 --> 00:42:08.860 line:83%
- To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

607
00:42:08.894 --> 00:42:11.096 line:83%
- Just proves
you're faster, that's all.

608
00:42:11.129 --> 00:42:13.364 line:83%
If I were to race, it would have
to be for something important.

609
00:42:13.398 --> 00:42:16.067 line:83%
Or why else do it at all?

610
00:42:18.403 --> 00:42:20.538 line:83%
- Why are you
letting me race?

611
00:42:20.572 --> 00:42:24.876 line:83%
- 'Cause you're
DK's kryptonite.

612
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:26.645 line:83%
And you owe me a car.

613

- Oh, shit.

616
00:42:57.743 --> 00:42:59.277 line:83%
What the--

617
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.046 line:83%
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

618
00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:03.782 line:83%
You can do better than 180k,
they can't catch you,

619
00:43:03.815 --> 00:43:07.085 line:83%
so they don't even try.

620
00:43:07.118 --> 00:43:09.154 line:83%
- You know what?

621
00:43:09.187 --> 00:43:11.823 line:83%
I'm beginning to like
this country already.

622
00:43:26.972 --> 00:43:29.140 line:83%
- Danny!

623
00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:31.009 line:83%
Oh, you're looking good.

624
00:43:31.042 --> 00:43:32.310 line:83%
- Hey.

( speaking Japanese )

628
00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:45.123 line:83%
- We gotta catch up.
Get you a drink on me, huh?

629
00:43:45.156 --> 00:43:46.291 line:83%
Let's go.

630
00:43:59.671 --> 00:44:03.008 line:83%
- Uh-oh.
Easy now, ladies.

631
00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:07.512 line:83%
Come on.

632
00:44:07.545 --> 00:44:08.847 line:83%

What's up?

636
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.685 line:83%
How you doing?

637
00:44:13.719 --> 00:44:16.287 line:83%
Hey, baby.

638
00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:17.355 line:83%
* Hey, Mami, you sexy

639
00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:19.825 line:83%

640
00:44:19.858 --> 00:44:21.459 line:83%

- There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.

00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:15.853 line:83%
Learn by doin' it.

809
00:54:15.886 --> 00:54:18.656 line:83%
The first drifters invented
drifting out here

810
00:54:18.689 --> 00:54:19.990 line:83%
in the mountains by feeling it.

811
00:54:20.024 --> 00:54:23.027 line:83%
So feel it.

812
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.342 line:83%
Again!

813
00:54:38.743 --> 00:54:40.110 line:83%
- What's in this bag?

814
00:54:40.144 --> 00:54:43.147 line:83%
- You'll see.

815
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.316 line:83%
How much you got?
Keep going, keep going.

( speaking Japanese )

817
00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:53.190 line:83%
- I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

818
00:54:58.963 --> 00:55:00.297 line:83%
- Again.

819
00:55:00.331 --> 00:55:01.198 line:83%
( no audible dialogue )

820
00:55:21.886 --> 00:55:23.287 line:83%
- Again.

821
00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:26.156 line:83%
- Oi, oi, oi, oi.

822
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.826 line:83%
( chattering )

823
00:55:32.397 --> 00:55:34.365 line:83%

824
00:55:34.399 --> 00:55:36.734 line:83%
Not too early, now.

825
00:55:41.138 --> 00:55:43.040 line:83%

Take a look at this.

00:56:41.499 --> 00:56:42.967 line:83%
You have a visitor.

832
00:56:47.972 --> 00:56:49.674 line:83%
- Hey, Twink.

833
00:56:49.707 --> 00:56:51.542 line:83%
Get this man a bunk.

( cheering )

839
00:58:12.723 --> 00:58:14.792 line:83%

I told you, didn't I?

840
00:58:18.863 --> 00:58:20.931 line:83%
( speaking Japanese )

841
00:58:54.665 --> 00:58:56.466 line:83%
- It's actually not bad.

842
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.669 line:83%
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

843
00:58:58.703 --> 00:59:03.440 line:83%
See, I'm not a total gaijin.

844
00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:05.776 line:83%
- I hate that word.

845
00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:08.178 line:83%
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

846
00:59:08.212 --> 00:59:11.115 line:83%
- I thought you
were born here.

847
00:59:11.148 --> 00:59:13.718 line:83%
- Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

848
00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:22.593 line:83%
My mom died when I was 10.

849
00:59:22.627 --> 00:59:27.331 line:83%
She came out here from Australia
when she finished high school.

850
00:59:27.364 --> 00:59:30.367 line:83%
And all I know about her
is that she went to work
in a hostess bar.

851
00:59:33.904 --> 00:59:36.540 line:83%
DK's grandmother
took me in.

852
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:41.511 line:83%
- Well, my parents split up
when I was three.

853
00:59:41.545 --> 00:59:46.116 line:83%
Me and Mom moved around a lot.

854
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:47.952 line:83%
Mostly 'cause of me.

855
00:59:47.985 --> 00:59:53.023 line:83%
Well, it was all
'cause of me.

856
00:59:53.057 --> 00:59:54.659 line:83%
Kind of made
myself an outsider,

857
00:59:54.692 --> 00:59:59.830 line:83%
you know, without
even thinking about it.

858
00:59:59.864 --> 01:00:02.332 line:83%
But I realize now,
outsider or insider,

859
01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:05.369 line:83%
it doesn't
really matter.

860
01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:10.107 line:83%
All that matters is knowing
what you really want
and going after it.

861
01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.863 line:83%
- We used to come up here
when we were kids.

862
01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:37.001 line:83%
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

863
01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:40.504 line:83%
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

864
01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:48.312 line:83%
Things were different
back then.

865
01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.820 line:83%
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

866
01:00:55.853 --> 01:00:58.455 line:83%
Back then, kids just
drove whatever they had.

867
01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.257 line:83%
You know, we just made do.

868
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.259 line:83%
No one bothered us.

869
01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:05.295 line:83%
- The day I got my license
is the day I got

870
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:07.297 line:83%
my first speeding ticket.

871
01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:09.967 line:83%
The day after that,
I won my first race.

872
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.137 line:83%
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

873
01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:16.673 line:83%
I gotta admit, it felt good.

874
01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:19.643 line:83%
It felt like--

875
01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:24.048 line:83%
- Like everything else
just disappears.

876
01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:26.283 line:83%
- No past and no future.

877
01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:29.253 line:83%
- No problems.

878
01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:31.621 line:83%
Just the moment.

879
01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:56.713 line:83%
- Boy needs to chill.

880
01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:00.517 line:83%
Hey, Twink, I'm gonna
grab another set.

881
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:01.786 line:83%
- Whoa!

882
01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:02.853 line:83%
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

883
01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:04.288 line:83%
Another set? No.

884
01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:06.256 line:83%
Look, that was your
third set today.

885
01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:07.657 line:83%
I mean, them tires
ain't cheap.

886
01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.059 line:83%
( cars approaching )

887
01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:19.970 line:83%
- DK, grab a chair.

888
01:02:20.004 --> 01:02:22.106 line:83%
We're about to roast
some marshmallows.

889
01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:24.842 line:83%
- Yo, come on, man, look--

890
01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:42.692 line:83%
- Stay away from her,
or the only thing you'll be
driving is a wheelchair.

( speaking Japanese )

892
01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:49.699 line:83%

( spits )

894
01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:04.481 line:83%
- I'm all right.

895
01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:05.883 line:83%
- What'd you expect?

896
01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:07.151 line:83%
You didn't just play
with fire,

897
01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:09.353 line:83%
you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

898
01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:18.095 line:83%
( chattering in Japanese )

899
01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.811 line:83%
- It's over.

01:03:38.582 --> 01:03:40.650 line:83%
( speaking Japanese )

901
01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:57.134 line:83%
- All this over a gaijin?

902
01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:00.971 line:83%
- I am a gaijin.

903
01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:02.839 line:83%
You've changed, DK.

904
01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:10.847 line:83%
- You say I've changed.

905
01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:16.853 line:83%
But we're not so different,
you and I.

906
01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:18.889 line:83%
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

907
01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.665 line:83%
They say your mom was
the best trick

908
01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.968 line:83%
in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

909
01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:33.603 line:83%
- Leave my mother
out of this.

910
01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:36.873 line:83%
- If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

911
01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:41.278 line:83%
doing anything for a buck.

912
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.646 line:83%
- Think anyone would
take a second look at you

913
01:04:42.679 --> 01:04:44.714 line:83%
if it wasn't
for your uncle?

914
01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.730 line:83%
- We're the same, Neela.

915
01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:07.604 line:83%
Difference is I know who
I am and where I belong.

916
01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.312 line:83%
Do you know who you are?

917
01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:22.152 line:83%
Do you know where you belong?

918
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.140 line:83%
- Hey.

919
01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:48.445 line:83%

Uncle.

Uncle Kamata,
I was just about to go see you.

924
01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:42.199 line:83%
Have you been well?

925
01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:43.267 line:83%
Yes.

926
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.036 line:83%
Here's last week's take.

927
01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:50.674 line:83%
Business good?

928
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:53.743 line:83%
Please.

929
01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:06.190 line:83%
To tell you the truth...

930
01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:12.429 line:83%
I look over these
printouts of yours...

931
01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:17.101 line:83%
and I don't understand half of
what I'm looking at.

932
01:07:17.134 --> 01:07:18.535 line:83%
( chuckles )

933
01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:20.904 line:83%
It looks more complicated
than it is.

934
01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:27.577 line:83%
Then how is it even I
am able to figure out...

935
01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:34.551 line:83%
that your partner is
stealing from us?

936
01:07:38.455 --> 01:07:39.923 line:83%
Even if that were true...

937
01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:45.095 line:83%
It couldn't have been much,
uncle. I would've caught it.

938
01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:51.601 line:83%
There's an old saying:

939
01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.739 line:83%
For want of a nail...

940
01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:57.774 line:83%
the horseshoe was lost.

941
01:07:59.343 --> 01:08:02.779 line:83%
For want of a horseshoe,
the steed was lost.

942
01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:05.782 line:83%
For want of a steed...

943
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.018 line:83%
the message was
not delivered.

944
01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:12.589 line:83%
For want of an
undelivered message...

945
01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:17.127 line:83%
the war was lost.

946
01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:29.473 line:83%

947
01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:36.480 line:83%

Put my reputation
on the line for you!

952
01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.544 line:83%
We were partners!

953
01:09:40.577 --> 01:09:42.979 line:83%
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

954
01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:46.216 line:83%
- Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

955
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:49.052 line:83%
This is what we do.

Hmm? Is this what we do?

959
01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:05.702 line:83%
- Man, you need me.

960

You'd still be
shaking down teahouses
