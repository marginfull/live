Excuse me.

327
00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:15.603 line:82%
Is this the registration

Thank you.

339
00:23:52.223 --> 00:23:55.351 line:82%
You... You can't keep out
a state team captain.

340
00:23:56.686 --> 00:23:58.187 line:82%
Which state team's captain are you?

Chandigarh.

342
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:02.441 line:82%
Is this the Chandigarh team?

343
00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:03.734 line:82%
No.

344
00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:07.238 line:82%
But I'm a captain of a state team.

345
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:10.283 line:82%
And I'm the coach of the
Indian National Women's Team.

346
00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:13.870 line:82%
I cannot hear or see the names of states.

347
00:24:14.287 --> 00:24:17.206 line:82%
I can only hear the name
of one country. India.

348
00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:21.085 line:82%
And in that team, there is
no place for late comers.

349
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:22.545 line:82%
Everyone, understand that?

350

Okay.

351

Kit up and do 10 rounds,

353
00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:33.681 line:82%
and report here in exactly seven minutes.

354
00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:36.058 line:82%
Get it done in seven minutes,
you can join the team.

355
00:24:36.142 --> 00:24:38.811 line:82%
If not, take the train back to Chandigarh.

356
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.315 line:82%
Sir, seven minutes?

357
00:24:42.523 --> 00:24:43.691 line:82%
Ms. Krishna.

358
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.445 line:82%
Now each player will step forward

359
00:24:47.778 --> 00:24:49.906 line:82%

because I won't repeat it.

383

then for their teammates,

385

The Association will kick him out.

So unless we play by his rules,
he will not let us play.

Tuglaq has lost it.

Actually, she is not a bad player.

670
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.550 line:82%
When she whacks the ball hard,
it takes four girls to stop it.

I haven't even started.

-What?

684

Look, if you do not forgive me,
there will be a fight.

685
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:10.602 line:82%
Both of us will get hurt,

686
00:46:10.685 --> 00:46:12.228 line:82%
and we will have to go to jail.

687
00:46:12.312 --> 00:46:14.314 line:82%
So tell me. Do you accept my apology,
or should we go to the police?

In the World Cup final,
the team lost to Pakistan.

00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:15.333 line:82%
Wasn't he the team captain?

700
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:17.544 line:82%
What captain?

701

This is India. Anything is possible.

He has already sold his country once.

00:47:35.144 --> 00:47:37.397 line:82%
This time, he may just sell us as well.

811
00:52:47.248 --> 00:52:49.250 line:82%
Leave the ball, sit!

812
00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:51.252 line:82%
Go, right!

813
00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:54.755 line:82%
Go to hell!

814
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:58.217 line:82%
Trap, look, and pass.

815
00:52:58.301 --> 00:53:00.761 line:82%
Stop, look, and move it ahead.

816
00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:03.055 line:82%
Do not move yourself forward.
Move the ball forward!

817
00:53:03.514 --> 00:53:05.558 line:82%
Do one thing, pick up the ball.

818
00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:07.602 line:82%
Pick it up!

819
00:53:09.729 --> 00:53:11.272 line:82%
Put it in your pocket and go home.

820
00:53:11.731 --> 00:53:13.190 line:82%
Go play on the Chandigarh team
from tomorrow.

821
00:53:13.274 --> 00:53:14.692 line:82%
No need to play here.

822
00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:17.695 line:82%
And, you!

823
00:53:20.573 --> 00:53:21.908 line:82%
What are you so angry about?

824
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.244 line:82%
Raise your game first
and then raise your voice.

825
00:53:25.328 --> 00:53:27.747 line:82%
If I hear you shout out one more time,

826
00:53:28.331 --> 00:53:30.249 line:82%
you will be out!

827
00:53:37.298 --> 00:53:38.341 line:82%
Hey, you!

828
00:53:39.342 --> 00:53:40.468 line:82%
Why are you the center-half?

829
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:42.553 line:82%
Because you are the senior
most player in the team.

830
00:53:42.803 --> 00:53:46.557 line:82%
Your job is not to push the
forward line but to teach them.

831
00:53:47.683 --> 00:53:48.976 line:82%
And one more thing.

832
00:53:50.186 --> 00:53:52.313 line:82%
There can only be one bully in every team.

833
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.150 line:82%
And for this team, it is me.

834
00:53:59.737 --> 00:54:00.780 line:82%
Look behind!

835
00:54:00.863 --> 00:54:01.906 line:82%
Pass it.

836
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:05.451 line:82%
You! Call this a pass?

837
00:54:06.619 --> 00:54:08.788 line:82%
You are only good enough
to plough fields in your village.

838
00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:10.373 line:82%
Forget about hockey!

839
00:54:11.624 --> 00:54:13.876 line:82%
And why are you standing around?
Go get the ball!

840
00:54:14.669 --> 00:54:16.087 line:82%
What are you looking at?
[blows whistle]

841
00:54:16.462 --> 00:54:18.673 line:82%
Right! Left!

842
00:54:19.006 --> 00:54:20.925 line:82%
Right! Left!

843
00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:23.719 line:82%
Right! Left!

844
00:54:24.053 --> 00:54:25.054 line:82%
Relax!

845
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:26.555 line:82%
Nethra!

846
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:31.519 line:82%
[blows whistle]
Ms. Krishna.

847
00:54:32.061 --> 00:54:34.772 line:82%
Give her water and take her out! Quickly!

848
00:54:38.484 --> 00:54:39.568 line:82%
So...

849
00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:43.489 line:82%
you are India's best hockey players!

850
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:45.908 line:82%
You will go to the World Championship!

851
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:48.536 line:82%
To raise India's flag!

852
00:54:51.372 --> 00:54:52.832 line:82%
The Association is right.

853
00:54:53.082 --> 00:54:56.168 line:82%
How will you ever play hockey?

854
00:54:56.877 --> 00:54:58.045 line:82%
You cannot play as one team.

855
00:54:58.129 --> 00:55:00.089 line:82%
How the hell will you ever win
a World Championship?

856
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:01.507 line:82%
What are you staring at?

857
00:55:01.757 --> 00:55:03.384 line:82%
She is unconscious, not dead!

858
00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:06.345 line:82%
Ms. Krishna! Take her away! Out!

859
00:55:09.557 --> 00:55:11.392 line:82%
I had said it on the first day.

860
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:17.231 line:82%
This team only needs those
who first play for India.

861
00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:20.234 line:82%
Then, for their teammates.

862
00:55:20.693 --> 00:55:24.780 line:82%
And then, if there is any
life left, for themselves.

863
00:55:26.407 --> 00:55:27.700 line:82%
Let's start again.

864
00:55:28.492 --> 00:55:29.952 line:82%
[blows whistle]

865
00:55:30.036 --> 00:55:31.037 line:82%
Right!

866
00:55:51.223 --> 00:55:53.100 line:82%
[water running]

867
00:56:07.948 --> 00:56:11.243 line:82%
So, did you see what happens
when you let the coach think he is God?

868
00:56:14.246 --> 00:56:15.790 line:82%
The blood will not stop.

869
00:56:16.957 --> 00:56:18.667 line:82%
I warned you guys.

870
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:20.586 line:82%
Have seen lot like these from years.

871
00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:22.838 line:82%
Let me help.

872
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.965 line:82%
Do you want to eat something?

873
00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:30.262 line:82%
Wake up at 4:00 a.m., run for 20km.

874
00:56:30.513 --> 00:56:32.515 line:82%
And on the field, he does not let us play.

875
00:56:32.807 --> 00:56:34.058 line:82%
What kind of a camp is this?

876
00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:35.434 line:82%
Does it hurt a lot?

877
00:56:36.519 --> 00:56:37.978 line:82%
Here! It hurts here.

878
00:56:39.105 --> 00:56:40.731 line:82%
He insulted us!

879
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.691 line:82%
Hit with the ball!

880
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:45.986 line:82%
He knows damn well
you cannot speak English.

881
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:47.196 line:82%
But you have to learn it!

882
00:56:47.446 --> 00:56:49.949 line:82%
What you have not learnt
in your whole life, learn it in a day!

883
00:56:50.032 --> 00:56:51.408 line:82%
Or else get out of the team.

884
00:56:51.492 --> 00:56:52.701 line:82%
Hey, he cannot throw you out!

885
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:56.664 line:82%
Do not worry, I will teach you.

886
00:56:56.872 --> 00:56:58.582 line:82%
How can he cut you out of the team?

887
00:56:58.791 --> 00:57:00.334 line:82%
What do you say, Aliya?

888
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:03.462 line:82%
No freedom to eat, to move around

889
00:57:04.296 --> 00:57:06.090 line:82%
and when we play, he insults us.

890
00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:08.884 line:82%
This is not a primary school.

891
00:57:08.968 --> 00:57:10.970 line:82%
Each girl is a national level player.

892
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.764 line:82%
A champion from her state.
That is why she is here.

893
00:57:14.098 --> 00:57:16.183 line:82%
If there is a failure among us, it is him.

894
00:57:16.809 --> 00:57:18.352 line:82%
He sold his country out in the World Cup!

895
00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:20.980 line:82%
Was thrown out of the team, and the game.

896
00:57:22.398 --> 00:57:24.567 line:82%
What else can I say?
I am ashamed to say any more.

897
00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:27.361 line:82%
Does it hurt?

898
00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:32.116 line:82%
I have a spray.

899
00:57:36.662 --> 00:57:37.746 line:82%
Sorry.

900
00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:38.831 line:82%
How is Nethra?

901
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:40.708 line:82%
She's all right.

902
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:43.961 line:82%
The doctor says she will be back
to practice in a couple of days.

903
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.005 line:82%
Practice?

904
00:57:46.755 --> 00:57:48.048 line:82%
Have you lost it?

905
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:50.926 line:82%
From now on, there will be no practice.

906
00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:53.721 line:82%
There will be no practice from tomorrow!

907
00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:54.805 line:82%
Look here, Bindia...

908
00:57:55.014 --> 00:57:56.515 line:82%
You look here!

909
00:57:59.935 --> 00:58:01.770 line:82%
We know you like him...

910
00:58:02.438 --> 00:58:06.358 line:82%
...but you should also realize
that the team is on this side.

911
00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:13.407 line:82%
It is time you choose
which side you're on.

912
00:58:14.325 --> 00:58:15.409 line:82%
Yes.

913
00:58:15.993 --> 00:58:17.286 line:82%
Definitely.

914
00:58:20.289 --> 00:58:21.665 line:82%
I have thought about it.

915
00:58:22.166 --> 00:58:26.086 line:82%
Now, only the Association can decide
how this team should run.

916
00:58:26.879 --> 00:58:29.381 line:82%
The way teams have always run
in this country.

917
00:58:30.591 --> 00:58:32.760 line:82%
Or the way Tuglaq wants it.

918
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:43.646 line:82%
We'll all sign this.

919
00:58:46.315 --> 00:58:48.651 line:82%
Now, it is either the coach...

920
00:58:49.485 --> 00:58:51.153 line:82%
...or our team.

921
00:58:53.614 --> 00:58:55.449 line:82%
Sign this, Gul.

922
00:59:18.013 --> 00:59:19.139 line:82%
Sir.

923
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.434 line:82%
Have some.

924
00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:26.313 line:82%
Wasn't that too much today?

925
00:59:28.774 --> 00:59:30.234 line:82%
They are girls, after all.

926
00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:32.152 line:82%
How much can we push them?

927
00:59:32.736 --> 00:59:34.947 line:82%
If you look for the strength of boys...

928
00:59:35.197 --> 00:59:37.866 line:82%
I am not looking for strength.
I am looking for team spirit.

929
00:59:38.659 --> 00:59:41.245 line:82%
You do not need strength to make
a team, you need team spirit.

930
00:59:42.663 --> 00:59:44.581 line:82%
But, sir...

931
00:59:44.665 --> 00:59:46.625 line:82%
at this rate, you will become their enemy.

932
00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:51.672 line:82%
If they can become a team
by making me an enemy,

933
00:59:51.964 --> 00:59:54.842 line:82%
then it is a small price
to pay, Ms. Krishna.

934
01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:12.693 line:82%
Why are you not on the field?

935
01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.030 line:82%
Is there a problem?

936
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:20.409 line:82%
The team does not want
to practice with you.

937
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.286 line:82%
What rubbish!

938
01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:26.665 line:82%
We want a new coach.

939
01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:28.667 line:82%
I will give you one.

940
01:00:28.876 --> 01:00:31.128 line:82%
Why, Ms. Krishna? Why would you hit us?

941
01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:33.797 line:82%
We are not the ones who sold our country.

942
01:00:33.881 --> 01:00:35.716 line:82%
-Quiet!
-Sir!

943
01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:45.768 line:82%
Seven years.

944
01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:50.314 line:82%
After seven years, I came back to hockey
believing that this time,

945
01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:55.903 line:82%
I will beat the one thing that
defeated my team once and for all.

946
01:00:58.197 --> 01:00:59.198 line:82%
But today...

947
01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:02.534 line:82%
...once again, I have lost to it.

948
01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:07.748 line:82%
You do not have a problem with me.

949
01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:11.210 line:82%
You have a problem with the fact...

950
01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.921 line:82%
...that instead of making you
play against each other,

951
01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.590 line:82%
I am forcing you to play with one another.

952
01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:18.717 line:82%
Because I have forced you
to think about your team

953
01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:20.052 line:82%
before you think about yourself.

954
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:24.056 line:82%
Because I forced you to play for India
before you play for your own state.

955
01:01:27.393 --> 01:01:28.435 line:82%
Fine.

956
01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.064 line:82%
You have won.

957
01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:36.318 line:82%
I have lost.

958
01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:42.783 line:82%
But I am not sorry to you.

959
01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.785 line:82%
I am sorry...

960
01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.456 line:82%
...to my country.

961
01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:54.002 line:82%
Which even after taking my blood,
sweat, my love, my life,

962
01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.130 line:82%
does not believe that

963
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:03.345 line:82%
I played for it once,
and will play for it all my life.

964
01:02:08.434 --> 01:02:11.395 line:82%
I resign as the coach of this team.

[somber music]

966
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.077 line:82%
Please, just think it over, sir.

967
01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:19.171 line:82%
You have worked so hard.

968
01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:43.904 line:82%
Today is my last day in this camp.

969
01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.366 line:82%
Before I leave,

970
01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.493 line:82%
I am taking the staff out for lunch.

971
01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:54.623 line:82%
You are welcome to join us if you wish.

972
01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:59.419 line:82%

1597
01:55:32.134 --> 01:55:34.970 line:82%
to the Championship couple of months ago.

1598
01:55:35.679 --> 01:55:38.807 line:82%
Who could have guessed that India would
score such a smashing goal in World hockey

1599
01:55:38.891 --> 01:55:40.893 line:82%
without one of the world's best
center-forwards

1600
01:55:41.143 --> 01:55:44.438 line:82%
even lifting a hockey stick
or entering the field.

1601
01:55:52.738 --> 01:55:55.032 line:82%
-Hi, Bill!
-Well played.

1602
01:55:56.408 --> 01:55:57.868 line:82%
Thanks.

1603
01:55:59.953 --> 01:56:02.706 line:82%
-Can I please get your autograph?
-Sure.

1604
01:56:45.666 --> 01:56:46.750 line:82%
Whoa!

1605
01:56:47.793 --> 01:56:48.919 line:82%
I love the shoes.

1606
01:56:49.670 --> 01:56:51.630 line:82%
You are definitely going to be

1607
01:56:51.714 --> 01:56:53.716 line:82%
the Highest Scorer of
the World Championship.

1608
01:56:55.175 --> 01:56:56.927 line:82%
But you have got competition.

1609
01:56:57.261 --> 01:56:59.555 line:82%
See! Eight goals.

1610
01:57:00.055 --> 01:57:02.224 line:82%
Komal's ahead once more.

1611
01:57:02.307 --> 01:57:03.434 line:82%
You idiots.

1612
01:57:04.017 --> 01:57:06.311 line:82%
You have your own
World Championship going on.

1613
01:57:06.395 --> 01:57:07.521 line:82%
[laughter]

1614
01:57:09.314 --> 01:57:10.399 line:82%
-[Sukhlal] Hello.
-Hello.

1615
01:57:11.066 --> 01:57:13.777 line:82%
Mr. Sukhlal! Speak up!

1616
01:57:14.111 --> 01:57:15.571 line:82%
[Sukhlal] Amazing, Ms. Krishna!

1617
01:57:15.779 --> 01:57:19.491 line:82%
These devils have been
raising quite a hell.

1618
01:57:19.575 --> 01:57:21.744 line:82%
With your blessings, Mr. Sukhlal.

1619
01:57:21.827 --> 01:57:23.787 line:82%
The travelling theatre
had come by, Ms. Krishna.

1620
01:57:23.871 --> 01:57:25.456 line:82%
I made it very clear to them

1621
01:57:25.539 --> 01:57:27.583 line:82%
that this is the Indian women
hockey team's ground.

1622
01:57:27.666 --> 01:57:30.878 line:82%
It is waiting for its team. I'm not
going to give it out to anyone.

1623
01:57:31.170 --> 01:57:34.339 line:82%
Now, only hockey practices
will be held here.

1624
01:57:34.423 --> 01:57:36.550 line:82%
Hello, here. Speak here.

1625
01:57:36.633 --> 01:57:40.929 line:82%
Hello! I am really missing
your curd rice, Mr. Sukhlal.

1626
01:57:41.305 --> 01:57:44.600 line:82%
If you guys win the World Cup,

1627
01:57:44.683 --> 01:57:48.562 line:82%
I will make curd rice for you all my life.

1628
01:57:48.896 --> 01:57:51.982 line:82%
Don't lose now. Don't lose.

1629
01:57:53.942 --> 01:57:55.486 line:82%
We will not.

1630
01:57:56.195 --> 01:57:58.989 line:82%
We will lose our lives, but not the game.

01:58:24.014 --> 01:58:25.057 line:82%
Look.

1637
01:58:26.975 --> 01:58:29.895 line:82%
It is the first time I've seen
a foreigner raise the Indian flag.

1638
01:58:33.565 --> 01:58:37.319 line:82%
We have reached the finals.
Is this a dream?

What do you think?

1640
01:58:41.031 --> 01:58:42.449 line:82%
It must be a dream.

1641
01:58:44.701 --> 01:58:46.662 line:82%
It is your dream, isn't it?

[man] Thank you very much

[Kapil] Tonight is the night
for an official reception

1645
01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:07.683 line:82%
for the finalists.

1646
01:59:08.225 --> 01:59:13.814 line:82%
The Federation of International Hockey
is holding a dinner in their honor.

1647
01:59:14.022 --> 01:59:17.609 line:82%
So that tonight they can forget
about winning or losing

1648
01:59:18.110 --> 01:59:22.155 line:82%
and just celebrate that they are
the two best teams in the world.

1649

[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
the six-time World Cup champion...

1650

...the team from Australia.

1651
02:00:03.614 --> 02:00:06.074 line:82%
Sorry. Best of luck.

1652
02:00:06.158 --> 02:00:07.618 line:82%
Yes, yes. Happy Diwali.

1653
02:00:07.993 --> 02:00:09.119 line:82%
What's did she say?

1654
02:00:09.202 --> 02:00:11.830 line:82%
She's saying watch out
for the fireworks tomorrow.

1655
02:00:11.914 --> 02:00:13.290 line:82%
Excuse me.

1656
02:00:16.543 --> 02:00:18.253 line:82%
Do we have to wear this?

1657
02:00:18.337 --> 02:00:19.838 line:82%
First time wearing it. It is a pain.

1658
02:00:21.089 --> 02:00:23.133 line:82%
-Do you care for a drink?
-No, thank you.

1659

[whispering]

1660
02:00:29.014 --> 02:00:31.308 line:82%
-What is it, Nethra?
-Nothing.

1661
02:00:33.393 --> 02:00:34.728 line:82%
What is it?

1662
02:00:36.063 --> 02:00:38.315 line:82%
-What do you mean?
-I mean, why did you call me here?

1663
02:00:38.565 --> 02:00:40.651 line:82%
Me? You're the one who called me.

1664
02:00:40.734 --> 02:00:43.111 line:82%
Did a mad dog bite me to call you?

1665
02:00:43.195 --> 02:00:45.572 line:82%
-You called...
-[man] I have called you.

1666
02:00:47.032 --> 02:00:50.243 line:82%
You? But why, sir?

1667
02:00:51.536 --> 02:00:57.000 line:82%
To tell you that tomorrow,
we are going to lose in the finals.

1668
02:00:57.417 --> 02:00:59.670 line:82%
What? Why?

1669
02:01:00.128 --> 02:01:01.421 line:82%
Why?

1670
02:01:02.005 --> 02:01:04.633 line:82%
Because tomorrow, two of our players

1671
02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.470 line:82%
are going to play for Australia.

1672
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:14.101 line:82%
-No, sir, it is not like that...
-Do you think

1673
02:01:14.476 --> 02:01:16.937 line:82%
that the Australian coach
and team are blind?

1674
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:18.647 line:82%
You think they haven't figured out

1675
02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:21.274 line:82%
that India's main forwards
do not pass to each other?

1676
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:25.404 line:82%
You think they will not take
advantage of this fact?

1677
02:01:26.571 --> 02:01:32.411 line:82%
-Sir, whatever I do is for the team...
-Komal, you cannot fool me.

1678
02:01:32.661 --> 02:01:34.955 line:82%
At least do not try to fool yourself.

1679
02:01:35.539 --> 02:01:38.166 line:82%
You fought with you father,
mother, brother, your village

1680
02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:39.751 line:82%
to come here and play hockey.

1681
02:01:39.835 --> 02:01:41.586 line:82%
But now, you are playing something else.

1682
02:01:41.670 --> 02:01:43.338 line:82%
Even you know this.

1683
02:01:43.588 --> 02:01:45.340 line:82%
Tell her, sir. She's the one
who started it all...

1684
02:01:45.424 --> 02:01:48.176 line:82%
And you will finish it
in tomorrow's match?

1685
02:01:48.552 --> 02:01:51.221 line:82%
Is that the plan?

1686
02:01:55.517 --> 02:01:56.768 line:82%
And you.

1687
02:01:58.061 --> 02:01:59.563 line:82%
Preeti Sabarwal.

1688
02:02:01.898 --> 02:02:04.484 line:82%
Chandigarh Captain.

1689
02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:08.488 line:82%
You lost your consciousness to join
this team,

1690
02:02:10.073 --> 02:02:13.311 line:82%
but now you have lost all sense, why?

1691
02:02:17.414 --> 02:02:18.540 line:82%
Neither of you are children.

1692
02:02:18.623 --> 02:02:22.252 line:82%
You know very well that
if you do not play together,

1693
02:02:22.794 --> 02:02:24.171 line:82%
we will never win the finals.

1694
02:02:27.507 --> 02:02:32.012 line:82%
Once upon a time, an Indian team
had lost a final.

1695
02:02:34.056 --> 02:02:39.895 line:82%
You don't know what it is like
to bear that cross.

1696
02:02:39.978 --> 02:02:41.146 line:82%
But when you do...

1697
02:02:42.856 --> 02:02:44.733 line:82%
...it will be too heavy to bear.

1698
02:02:45.567 --> 02:02:47.277 line:82%
Neither of you has
the strength to bear it.

1699
02:02:48.153 --> 02:02:50.405 line:82%
Nobody has the strength to bear it.

1700
02:02:52.282 --> 02:02:55.077 line:82%
Between you two,
you both know what the problem is.

1701
02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.704 line:82%
All I know is that whether you
both play on our side or not...

1702
02:02:58.789 --> 02:03:02.542 line:82%
...the rest of my team will play
together against Australia.

1703
02:03:02.626 --> 02:03:05.170 line:82%
And if necessary, against
both of you as well.

1704
02:03:06.797 --> 02:03:08.298 line:82%
Now, both of you decide...

1705
02:03:09.758 --> 02:03:11.832 line:82%
whether you want to play with your team...

1706
02:03:14.638 --> 02:03:16.264 line:82%
...or against it?

1707
02:03:23.939 --> 02:03:27.734 line:82%
Whatever happens,
I will score the most goals.

1708
02:03:28.068 --> 02:03:29.820 line:82%
What are you trying to prove?

1709
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:32.197 line:82%
I am not trying to prove anything, Komal.

1710
02:03:33.156 --> 02:03:36.159 line:82%
I just want to show a foolish boy
what a woman is capable of.

1711
02:03:37.536 --> 02:03:40.038 line:82%
I will score the most goals,
no matter what happens.

1712
02:03:43.708 --> 02:03:45.585 line:82%
I want to see you try and do it.

1713
02:03:46.878 --> 02:03:48.463 line:82%
[whooshing]

1714
02:04:05.897 --> 02:04:09.151 line:82%
[man] And tonight is the night that
everybody has been waiting for.

1715
02:04:09.609 --> 02:04:12.320 line:82%
The night of the Women's
Hockey World Championship finals.

1716
02:04:12.696 --> 02:04:17.159 line:82%
A match that is completely unexpected.

1717
02:04:17.909 --> 02:04:22.539 line:82%
Because tonight we have the current,
and six-time World Champion, Australia,

1718
02:04:22.831 --> 02:04:26.209 line:82%
playing against India, a team
that has risen like a juggernaut.

1719
02:04:26.668 --> 02:04:29.296 line:82%
A team that has won the hearts of many

1720
02:04:29.379 --> 02:04:30.714 line:82%
with its dazzling display
of determination and skill.

1721
02:04:31.298 --> 02:04:34.301 line:82%
But winning hearts and winning the
World Cup are two different things.

1722
02:04:34.676 --> 02:04:37.929 line:82%
And this is the ordeal by fire
of Coach Kabir Khan's team.

1723
02:04:38.471 --> 02:04:41.725 line:82%
By what strategy, what skill,

1724
02:04:41.808 --> 02:04:44.728 line:82%
what magic, what dream,

1725
02:04:45.228 --> 02:04:49.107 line:82%
will this team from India beat the game

1726
02:04:49.191 --> 02:04:52.319 line:82%
against the six-time world champion?

1727
02:04:57.199 --> 02:04:58.700 line:82%
Girls.

1728
02:05:23.016 --> 02:05:24.601 line:82%
Seventy minutes.

1729
02:05:26.311 --> 02:05:28.355 line:82%
Seventy minutes is all you have.

1730
02:05:29.564 --> 02:05:34.361 line:82%
Perhaps, the most important
70 minutes of your life.

1731
02:05:35.779 --> 02:05:38.240 line:82%
Today, whether you play
very well, or badly...

1732
02:05:38.782 --> 02:05:40.158 line:82%
...you will always remember
these 70 minutes

1733
02:05:40.367 --> 02:05:42.452 line:82%
for the rest of your life.

1734
02:05:43.787 --> 02:05:47.457 line:82%
Today, I won't tell you how to play.

1735
02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:51.586 line:82%
All I will say is...

1736
02:05:52.462 --> 02:05:57.384 line:82%
Go! And play for all you're worth
in these 70 minutes.

1737
02:05:59.511 --> 02:06:02.639 line:82%
Because in the days to come...

1738
02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.976 line:82%
...whether life goes well for you or not,

1739
02:06:06.851 --> 02:06:08.803 line:82%
whether you have something
to call your own or not,

1740
02:06:08.877 --> 02:06:10.188 line:82%
whether you win or lose,

1741
02:06:10.272 --> 02:06:12.023 line:82%
these 70 minutes are something

1742
02:06:12.649 --> 02:06:15.235 line:82%
that nobody can ever take away from you.

1743
02:06:15.694 --> 02:06:16.945 line:82%
Nobody.

1744
02:06:19.698 --> 02:06:23.702 line:82%
So, I thought...

1745
02:06:25.203 --> 02:06:28.123 line:82%
I will not tell you
how to play today's match.

1746
02:06:28.206 --> 02:06:31.418 line:82%
You will. By playing it.

1747
02:06:33.086 --> 02:06:37.257 line:82%
Because I know that
if in these 70 minutes,

1748
02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:42.053 line:82%
each player of this team plays
the best hockey of her life,

1749
02:06:42.721 --> 02:06:47.142 line:82%
then not even God can
take away your 70 minutes.

India-1, Australia-2.

1796
02:11:14.075 --> 02:11:16.536 line:82%
Only a few minutes are left
and Australia's strategy

1797
02:11:16.744 --> 02:11:19.289 line:82%
is to not let go of the ball

1798
02:11:19.497 --> 02:11:22.667 line:82%
to kill India's chances
of scoring an equalizer.

1799

Australia has the ball.
