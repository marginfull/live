00:23:17.526 --> 00:23:19.615 line:83%
Y-You have to understand
your enemy's ob...

487
00:23:21.704 --> 00:23:23.489 line:83%
-You have...

488
00:23:23.532 --> 00:23:25.665 line:83%
-[whipped cream sprays]
-Sorry, mate.

489
00:23:25.708 --> 00:23:27.667 line:83%
You have to understand
your enemy's objective

490
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.233 line:83%
to know you've defeated 'em.

491
00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:30.844 line:83%
-We still don't.
-No.

492
00:23:30.887 --> 00:23:32.498 line:83%
I can help you out with that.

493
00:23:32.541 --> 00:23:34.587 line:83%
See, I'm thinking it has
something to do with them

494
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.676 line:83%
sending giant monsters
to kick the crap out of us.

495
00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:38.373 line:83%
No, no, no.

496
00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:39.983 line:83%
The Precursors wouldn't send
Kaiju to flatten a few cities

497
00:23:40.027 --> 00:23:41.985 line:83%
if they were trying
to wipe us all out.

498
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:44.118 line:83%
All right, look, Nate, I don't
have a problem with you, man.

499
00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:46.120 line:83%
But I had to make a choice.

500
00:23:46.163 --> 00:23:47.904 line:83%
It was between
your pretty face and prison.

501
00:23:47.948 --> 00:23:50.298 line:83%
I chose your pretty face.

502
00:23:50.341 --> 00:23:52.169 line:83%
Oh, well, I'm touched.

503
00:23:52.213 --> 00:23:54.171 line:83%
And how many damn toppings
do you need?

504
00:23:54.215 --> 00:23:55.477 line:83%
Leave my toppings be, man.

505
00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:57.044 line:83%
Don't mess with
my damn toppings.

506
00:23:57.087 --> 00:24:00.439 line:83%
So the cadets got, like, what,

507
00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:01.918 line:83%
couple of months
before they graduate?

508
00:24:01.962 --> 00:24:04.660 line:83%
-Six.
-Okay. I'll tell you what.

509
00:24:04.704 --> 00:24:07.010 line:83%
Every time you want to say
something soldiery to 'em,

510
00:24:07.054 --> 00:24:10.013 line:83%
I'll just nod, or like,
"Yep, what he said."

511
00:24:10.057 --> 00:24:12.581 line:83%
And then, before you know it,
they get to be pilots.

512
00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:14.365 line:83%
-And I get to get back
to my life. -Great.

513
00:24:14.409 --> 00:24:16.585 line:83%
Boom.

514
00:24:16.629 --> 00:24:18.805 line:83%
It may happen
sooner than you think.

515
00:24:18.848 --> 00:24:21.242 line:83%
How so?

516
00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:23.113 line:83%
Big dog and pony show tomorrow.

517
00:24:23.157 --> 00:24:24.506 line:83%
Shao and her team
are presenting

518
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.508 line:83%
this new drone program
they have.

519
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:28.379 line:83%
Could make us all obsolete.

520
00:24:28.423 --> 00:24:30.512 line:83%
Sounds like my
"get out of jail free" card.

521
00:24:33.123 --> 00:24:37.258 line:83%
You know, you can front
all you want,

522
00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:40.217 line:83%
but you and I both know
you could've been great.

523
00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:51.490 line:83%
[engine rumbling]

524
00:24:58.366 --> 00:24:59.628 line:83%
Sorry. [chuckles]

525
00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:01.674 line:83%
She doesn't do
the whole hand shaking thing.

526
00:25:01.717 --> 00:25:03.545 line:83%
Dr. Newton Geiszler,
head of research

527
00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:05.286 line:83%
and development
for Shao Industries.

528
00:25:05.329 --> 00:25:08.376 line:83%
That's a nice firm,
firm grip you got there, uh...

529
00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:22.608 line:83%
That's a much better
look on you.

530
00:25:22.651 --> 00:25:25.480 line:83%
Guess it's better than
prison stripes. Barely.

531
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.482 line:83%
[chuckles]
I-I'm sorry, is this him?

532
00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:29.484 line:83%
It-It's got to be him, right?
You're Stacker's kid.

533
00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:31.486 line:83%
Hey, uh, I'm Newt.

534
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.401 line:83%
I was, uh, I was a big fan
of your father's.

535
00:25:33.444 --> 00:25:35.011 line:83%
Amazing speech writer,
by the way.

536
00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:36.578 line:83%
Did you ever hear his one where
he canceled the apocalypse?

537
00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:38.580 line:83%
-Newton.
-Hermann.

538
00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:40.147 line:83%
I was hoping you'd be
tagging along.

539
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.584 line:83%
I could use your help on
an experiment I'm working on.

540
00:25:42.628 --> 00:25:44.499 line:83%
Now, this will
only take a moment.

541
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:46.501 line:83%
-I know how busy you are.
-Yeah.

542
00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.459 line:83%
Don't want to impose,
but, uh...

543
00:25:48.503 --> 00:25:50.331 line:83%
Aw, come on,
you can't impose on me.

544
00:25:50.374 --> 00:25:53.639 line:83%
I mean, we've been inside
each other's heads, right?

545
00:25:53.682 --> 00:25:55.684 line:83%
We've saved the world.

546
00:25:55.728 --> 00:25:57.251 line:83%
We've drifted with a Kaiju!

547
00:25:57.294 --> 00:25:58.774 line:83%
You know, if we hadn't
yanked that intel

548
00:25:58.818 --> 00:26:00.254 line:83%
out of that Kaiju's brain,

549
00:26:00.297 --> 00:26:02.082 line:83%
Raleigh would've never
been able to close the Breach.

550
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:03.910 line:83%
Now, that was you
and that was me.

551
00:26:03.953 --> 00:26:05.912 line:83%
Technically more me,

552
00:26:05.955 --> 00:26:07.827 line:83%
but any chance we could
make this quick or...?

553
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.394 line:83%
-Um, deployment.
-Huh?

554
00:26:10.438 --> 00:26:12.005 line:83%
Of Jaegers.

555
00:26:12.048 --> 00:26:13.441 line:83%
Deploying them into battle,
it takes, takes too much time.

556
00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:14.834 line:83%
The amount of damage

557
00:26:14.877 --> 00:26:17.184 line:83%
a Kaiju can inflict
before they've ev...

558
00:26:17.227 --> 00:26:20.274 line:83%
Ah, here.
I think I've found a solution.

559
00:26:22.406 --> 00:26:26.541 line:83%
Hermann, you know I can
never read your, uh...

560
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:29.196 line:83%
Uh, rocket thrusters, huh?

561
00:26:29.239 --> 00:26:31.502 line:83%
Yeah. No.

562
00:26:31.546 --> 00:26:33.374 line:83%
No. There's no fuel
in the world

563
00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:35.376 line:83%
with that kind of
boost-to-mass ratio. [chuckles]

564
00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:37.334 line:83%
From this world.

565
00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:42.209 line:83%
No.

566
00:26:42.252 --> 00:26:43.993 line:83%
I-Is that Kaiju blood?

567
00:26:44.037 --> 00:26:46.126 line:83%
Exactly.

568
00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:48.781 line:83%
I've discovered Kaiju blood
is highly reactive

569
00:26:48.824 --> 00:26:51.479 line:83%
when it's combined
with rare earth elements--

570
00:26:51.522 --> 00:26:53.002 line:83%
cerium, lanthanum, gadolinium.

571
00:26:53.046 --> 00:26:54.569 line:83%
I realize that, pal. Okay.

572
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:56.179 line:83%
Y-You can't be fooling around
with this stuff.

573
00:26:56.223 --> 00:26:57.746 line:83%
You're gonna blow yourself up.
Uh...

574
00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.314 line:83%
Now, no one knows more about
Kaiju morphology than you.

575
00:27:00.357 --> 00:27:02.142 line:83%
-Okay. -And if you could
just take a look, please.

576
00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:05.275 line:83%
No, Hermann, I got to stop you.
Look, none of this matters.

577
00:27:05.319 --> 00:27:07.060 line:83%
Once my boss' drones
are approved,

578
00:27:07.103 --> 00:27:08.975 line:83%
deployment time,
that's gonna be a non-issue.

579
00:27:09.018 --> 00:27:12.413 line:83%
Within a year, buddy, we're
gonna have drones everywhere.

580
00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:15.285 line:83%
So you won't help me?

581
00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:18.332 line:83%
Look, why don't we talk about
it over dinner at my place?

582
00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:20.116 line:83%
Okay? You can
finally meet Alice.

583
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.640 line:83%
I don't need
a hot meal, Newton.

584
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:23.598 line:83%
What I need is a solution
to a very specific problem.

585
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:25.252 line:83%
-Hey.
-[watch beeps]

586
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:27.036 line:83%
Ah, that's me, bud.

587
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.386 line:83%
I'm sorry. Duty calls.
It's been nice catching up.

588
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.345 line:83%
Newton.

589
00:27:31.388 --> 00:27:33.173 line:83%
I, um...

590
00:27:35.741 --> 00:27:40.659 line:83%
I still get nightmares
about what we saw

591
00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:44.271 line:83%
when we drifted with
that disgusting Kaiju brain.

592
00:27:44.314 --> 00:27:46.273 line:83%
Yeah.

593
00:27:46.316 --> 00:27:50.494 line:83%
But... it was a hell
of a rush, wasn't it?

594
00:28:03.507 --> 00:28:04.683 line:83%
Oh, uh...

595
00:28:09.426 --> 00:28:10.732 line:83%
I-I know, I'm terrible.

596
00:28:10.776 --> 00:28:12.168 line:83%
Uh, yes, we shared
a lab together.

597
00:28:14.344 --> 00:28:16.303 line:83%
Oh, some crazy idea
he had about

598
00:28:16.346 --> 00:28:17.826 line:83%
thruster pods
on a, on a Jaeger.

599
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.446 line:83%
Oh. Well, [chuckles] the man's
completely harmless. Uh...

600
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.405 line:83%
-[speaks Mandarin]
-Uh, okay.

601
00:28:31.448 --> 00:28:36.105 line:83%
Could you say that again,
and this time about 80% slower?

602
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:40.240 line:83%
I said don't make me question
your loyalty. Understand?

603
00:28:40.283 --> 00:28:44.592 line:83%
Ay. [chuckles]
What's to question?

604
00:28:44.635 --> 00:28:46.725 line:83%
I... look, I barely
talk to the guy anyway.

605
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.734 line:83%
LIWEN:
My drones are the next step

606
00:28:55.777 --> 00:28:57.344 line:83%
in Jaeger evolution.

607
00:28:57.387 --> 00:29:00.347 line:83%
The system I designed
processes commands

608
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.262 line:83%
through a quantum data core.

609
00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:04.264 line:83%
This means that a single pilot

610
00:29:04.307 --> 00:29:08.790 line:83%
can operate the drone remotely
from anywhere in the world.

611
00:29:08.834 --> 00:29:11.924 line:83%
As soon as the council
approves deployment,

612
00:29:11.967 --> 00:29:15.362 line:83%
based on Secretary General
Mori's final report,

613
00:29:15.405 --> 00:29:17.799 line:83%
the days of struggling
to find and train

614
00:29:17.843 --> 00:29:21.455 line:83%
drift compatible pilots
will be a thing of the past.

615
00:29:21.498 --> 00:29:23.718 line:83%
And you think a bunch of desk
jockeys are better than us?

616
00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:26.242 line:83%
We are not here
to shut you down.

617
00:29:26.286 --> 00:29:27.983 line:83%
Cooperation between
our programs

618
00:29:28.027 --> 00:29:29.724 line:83%
has never been more vital.

619
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.813 line:83%
If there are any questions.

620
00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:34.729 line:83%
-Yeah, I got a question
right over here! -[clamoring]

621
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:36.905 line:83%
We are pilots,
not a bunch of office workers!

622
00:29:36.949 --> 00:29:39.603 line:83%
And now we're shouting.
There's no need to shout.

623
00:29:39.647 --> 00:29:41.997 line:83%
[clamoring continues]

624
00:29:44.652 --> 00:29:46.610 line:83%
JAKE:
Well, that was slick.

625
00:29:46.654 --> 00:29:49.831 line:83%
So, how long until all this is
shut down so I can go home?

626
00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:52.442 line:83%
I don't trust the tech.
Not yet, at least.

627
00:29:52.486 --> 00:29:54.531 line:83%
Well, it looks
pretty good to me.

628
00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:58.318 line:83%
Remote systems can be
hacked or compromised.

629
00:29:58.361 --> 00:30:00.320 line:83%
No, you've got
the key vote, right?

630
00:30:00.363 --> 00:30:03.323 line:83%
So there you go.
It's your decision.

631
00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:06.543 line:83%
I wish I could just
go ahead and approve them.

632
00:30:06.587 --> 00:30:10.939 line:83%
Nearly half the council
is backing Liwen.

633
00:30:10.983 --> 00:30:13.463 line:83%
They aren't going to like
my decision.

634
00:30:13.507 --> 00:30:17.337 line:83%
Who cares what they like
and what they don't like?

635
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.687 line:83%
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna go with you.

636
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.080 line:83%
For moral support.

637
00:30:21.123 --> 00:30:23.343 line:83%
Plus, I want to get
out of this place.

638
00:30:23.386 --> 00:30:26.346 line:83%
I'm glad you offered,
