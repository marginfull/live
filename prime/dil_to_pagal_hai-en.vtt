00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:42.833 line:82%
What is love?

2
00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:46.417 line:82%
Love? Love is life.

3
00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:49.292 line:82%
Love? What is love?

4
00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.417 line:82%
Why and where?

5
00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:56.958 line:82%
I believe that God predetermined
all our emotional relationships.

6
00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.417 line:82%
But He left it to us
to find each other.

7
00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.125 line:82%
He made us all couples

8
00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:05.292 line:82%
and each one has a soul mate.

9
00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:08.458 line:82%
A soul mate? What nonsense!

10
00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:10.167 line:82%
I don't believe in all this.

11
00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:15.042 line:82%
I'm absolutely sure that somewhere,
someone has been made for me

12
00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958 line:82%
And that someday,
I shall certainly meet him.

13
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.292 line:82%
Okay, but will
someone please tell me

14
00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:23.583 line:82%
how would I know the one
who has been made for me?

15
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:27.333 line:82%
I mean, will she be holding
a placard with my name on it?

16
00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:30.792 line:82%
When I see her, will
there be a clap of thunder

17
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:32.542 line:82%
or a flash of lightning? What

18
00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:34.333 line:82%
How would I recognize her?

19
00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:37.833 line:82%
I don't know what others would do,
but I'll certainly know it's him.

20
00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.083 line:82%
He will tell me

21
00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:44.208 line:82%
He will give me a sign,
and my heart would know it’s him.

22
00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.833 line:82%
-What is all this?
-This is love.

23
00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:49.917 line:82%
Love?

24
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.542 line:82%
However far apart they may be

25
00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:09.833 line:82%
And come what may
their paths will meet.

26
00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:13.417 line:82%
When two people are
made for each other.

27
00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:17.000 line:82%
Made for each other.

28
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.200 line:82%
Like the heart and heartbeats
Made for each other.

29
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.780 line:82%
Like the eye and the mirror
Made for each other.

30
00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.320 line:82%
Like the monsoon and the rains
Made for each other.

31
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.900 line:82%
There's a man for every woman
Made for each other.

32
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.200 line:82%
Made for each other.

33
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.070 line:82%
Made for each other.

34
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.650 line:82%
When God made a heart

35
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.450 line:82%
He split it in two.

36
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.530 line:82%
He gave them two names

37
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.490 line:82%
Radha and Krishna

38
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.030 line:82%
Now the two hearts beat.

39
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.150 line:82%
They part and they unite.

40
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.450 line:82%
For they are made for each other.

41
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.820 line:82%
Made for each other.

42
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.900 line:82%
Made for each other.

43
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.200 line:82%
Made for each other.

44
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.700 line:82%
Made for each other.

45
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.610 line:82%
I didn't get an inkling when

46
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.530 line:82%
furtively, like a thief

47
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.110 line:82%
I didn't get an inkling when

48
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.780 line:82%
furtively, like a thief

49
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.990 line:82%
the first look of love

50
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.450 line:82%
stole my heart away.

51
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.030 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

52
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.070 line:82%
I didn't get an inkling when

53
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.900 line:82%
furtively, like a thief

54
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.070 line:82%
the first look of love

55
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.530 line:82%
stole my heart away.

56
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.820 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

57
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.240 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

58
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.919 line:82%
In the hide-n-seek
of my first love

59
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:15.570 line:82%
In the hide-n-seek
of my first love

60
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:23.240 line:82%
I took refuge in the shelter
of his eyes without a thought.

61
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.570 line:82%
Now I'm frightened

62
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.610 line:82%
because furtively,
like a thief

63
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.650 line:82%
the first look of love

64
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.200 line:82%
stole my heart away

65
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.740 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

66
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.950 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

67
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.769 line:82%
My hair is disheveled, my gait

68
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.648 line:82%
is uncertain, as if I am drunk.

69
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.365 line:82%
My hair is disheveled, my gait

70
00:08:38.296 --> 00:08:40.700 line:82%
is uncertain, as if I am drunk.

71
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:48.360 line:82%
If I had been seen, it would
raise a million questions.

72
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.990 line:82%
Oh, how do I go home?

73
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.610 line:82%
for furtively, like a thief

74
00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.530 line:82%
the first look of love

75
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.360 line:82%
stole my heart away.

76
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.860 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

77
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.530 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

78
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.950 line:82%
I didn't get an inkling when

79
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.650 line:82%
furtively, like a thief

80
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.740 line:82%
the first look of love

81
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.320 line:82%
stole my heart away.

82
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.950 line:82%
-Jimmy, is Rahul at the entry point?
-No, Rahul's not here.

83
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.070 line:82%
What do you mean?

84
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.900 line:82%
He's supposed to enter in
two minutes. Find him, fast!

85
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.400 line:82%
Oh God! I'll be right back.

86
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.450 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

87
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.200 line:82%
-Shruti, did you find Rahul?
-No.

88
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.320 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

89
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.900 line:82%
Stole my heart away.

90
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.700 line:82%
I didn't get an inkling when

91
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.280 line:82%
furtively, like a thief

92
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.110 line:82%
I didn't get an inkling when

93
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.820 line:82%
furtively, like a thief

94
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.240 line:82%
The first glance of love

95
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.820 line:82%
stole my heart away.

96
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.700 line:82%
stole my heart away.

97
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.570 line:82%
stole my heart away.

98
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.530 line:82%
stole my heart away.

99
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.900 line:82%
stole my heart away.

100
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.280 line:82%
-Yes, very good. Keep it up, everyone.
-Rahul

101
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.110 line:82%
Rahul! I've told you
numerous times that

102
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.950 line:82%
you should be at the wing
five minutes before your entry.

103
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.650 line:82%
When you're not there,
I get tensed that you'll be late

104
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.650 line:82%
I got this idea at the last minute.

105
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.190 line:82%
I thought if I jump on the stage

106
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.980 line:82%
the audience will freak out.
It happened.

107
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.230 line:82%
Anyway, there was no goof up.
What's this fuss now?

108
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.850 line:82%
Look Rahul, I'm fed up
with your last minute entries.

109
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.980 line:82%
Nisha, I'm the director.

110
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.810 line:82%
I can change whatever and
whenever I want, including you.

111
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.190 line:82%
Forget it. You'll never
find another dancer like me.

112
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.095 line:82%
I can get Shruti to dance
better than you.

113
00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:29.440 line:82%
Shut up!

114
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.230 line:82%
Nisha! Fight later.
It's time for the stage.

115
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.810 line:82%
-Take the mike. I'll tell.
-Go and tell Supandi.

116
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.560 line:82%
-What?
-What?

117
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.520 line:82%
Okay everybody,
let's get the lights.

118
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.440 line:82%
Idiot.

119
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.520 line:82%
Thank you. Thank you very much.

120
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.560 line:82%
I'd like to thank all of you on
behalf of the entire team

121
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.980 line:82%
for making this dance show
a huge success. Thank you so much.

122
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.020 line:82%
As you all know, this is
the last night of this show.

123
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:18.600 line:82%
However, I promise you that
we'll be back here in three months

124
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.060 line:82%
with a new story, new songs

125
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.100 line:82%
and a new name. Maya.

126
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.945 line:82%
Maya?

127
00:12:26.976 --> 00:12:30.770 line:82%
Yes, Maya is the
name of our new dance show.

128
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.770 line:82%
Thank you very much, everybody,
and good night to you.

129
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.940 line:82%
Cheers!

130
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.270 line:82%
-Wonderful.
-We had good fun at the show.

131
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.690 line:82%
Hey, hang on a minute.

132
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.690 line:82%
Rahul, this new play Maya
What's it all about? Tell us.

133
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.400 line:82%
-Tell us Rahul. Please.
-Get up.

134
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.400 line:82%
-Tell us about it.
-Okay, okay.

135
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.190 line:82%
Maya.

136
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.190 line:82%
Maya.

137
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.650 line:82%
-I don't know. -What?
-I don't know. -What is this?

138
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.690 line:82%
If you didn't know that,
then why did you announce

139
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.810 line:82%
that we're doing a new play
called 'Maya'

140
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.520 line:82%
and that we'll do
it in three months?

141
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.650 line:82%
Now look, even I don't
know who or what Maya is

142
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.980 line:82%
but I do know that in three months
we'll do a play called 'Maya'.

143
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.690 line:82%
Do you have a girl
who's like Maya in your mind?

144
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.270 line:82%
She's still in my imagination,
not in my mind.

145
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.060 line:82%
Nisha! I've got a girl in mind.

146
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.940 line:82%
Rahul! Aren't you talking about
Pammi, the Colonel's daughter?

147
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.850 line:82%
Am I right? Is it Pammi?

148
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.900 line:82%
Rahul, is Maya the kind of
girl you can fall in love with?

149
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.190 line:82%
I don't fall in love with girls.

150
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.190 line:82%
-Girls fall for me.
-There he goes again.

151
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.650 line:82%
But Maya is the kind of
girl that anyone could love.

152
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.100 line:82%
Maya is the kind of girl for
whom you would leave your Soni.

153
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.560 line:82%
-You dare not cheat on my sister.
-Ballu, relax. Be Quiet.

154
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.520 line:82%
What does she do?

155
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.310 line:82%
She comes in dreams.

156
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.100 line:82%
Is Maya beautiful?

157
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.270 line:82%
Very much.

158
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.650 line:82%
This Maya must be
doing something.

159
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.850 line:82%
She must be working, singing,
dancing

160
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.190 line:82%
-Maya dances, but not like you.
-What?

161
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.150 line:82%
She dances only for herself.

162
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.480 line:82%
Excuse me, but she is a feeling,
a fantasy, she's beautiful

163
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.560 line:82%
and she dances. We must
find her in three months.

164
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.020 line:82%
So who is she?

165
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.150 line:82%
Maya is all these things,
and yet she is only Maya.

166
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.520 line:82%
Oh, Rahul. There you rattle
again on the same topic.

167
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.810 line:82%
I'm hungry. So I'll get
something to eat. Okay?

168
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.100 line:82%
-Hey, leave him alone.
-You all carry on. I'm coming.

169
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.600 line:82%
Maya.

170
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.270 line:82%
I've spent my life managing chores.
I'll make a decision today.

171
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.400 line:82%
-Good morning, aunty!
-Silly girl! Where were you?

172
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.850 line:82%
-I've been looking for you all over.
-I was outside.

173
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.440 line:82%
Now you must come with me.

174
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.230 line:82%
-Where? -I'm tired of
you uncle's daily nonsense.

175
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.400 line:82%
So, today there will be a fight,
and you must take my side.

176
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.900 line:82%
Okay. Let's go.

177
00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:00.560 line:82%
Sometimes, a thought

178
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:06.150 line:82%
crosses my mind

179
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.480 line:82%
Bravo, bravo!

180
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.685 line:82%
As if you all have been called

181
00:16:13.126 --> 00:16:17.810 line:82%
only for me.

182
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.930 line:82%
-Wow.
-You've been

183
00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:24.445 line:82%
scrubbing dishes

184
00:16:24.756 --> 00:16:27.830 line:82%
for so long.

185
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.005 line:82%
You've been made to sit in
the audience

186
00:16:34.186 --> 00:16:37.690 line:82%
for my sake.

187
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.690 line:82%
Bravo, bravo. What a performance!

188
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.480 line:82%
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

189
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.150 line:82%
Go on, Chandni I mean, Shanti.

190
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.400 line:82%
If you permit, can
we have a tea break?

191
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.730 line:82%
Break whatever you want.

192
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.520 line:82%
If you don't mind, may I have
a word with your students?

193
00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.100 line:82%
Of course.

194
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.100 line:82%
-Watchman, gardener
-Yes, ma'am.

195
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.270 line:82%
-Shankar and Ramu.
-Yes.

196
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.469 line:82%
If you don't mind, will
you all get back to work now?

197
00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.020 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-Thank you.

198
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.560 line:82%
-Why are you driving away my audience?
-Quiet.

199
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.940 line:82%
You gather all the servants
here and stall all the work.

200
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.850 line:82%
I have to do all the chores myself.

201
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.600 line:82%
Today onwards,
no more music recitals.

202
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.900 line:82%
Henceforth, only you will
listen to your music. No audience.

203
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.940 line:82%
My music isn't appreciated
in my own house.

204
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.940 line:82%
How would anybody
else appreciate it?

205
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.520 line:82%
Thanks to your aunt's attitude,
I could never become a great singer.

206
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.480 line:82%
I know, I know. Now forget
it and have a cup of tea.

207
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.270 line:82%
-No, I don't want any tea.
-Oh come on, Uncle.

208
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.850 line:82%
Have a cup of tea,
and sing a song for me.

209
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.730 line:82%
-Will you listen to my song?
-Of course.

210
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.650 line:82%
-Really?
-Certainly.

211
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.600 line:82%
So let me have the tea.

212
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.940 line:82%
Pooja, there's a parcel for you.

213
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.190 line:82%
It's from Ajay!
Should be his cassette.

214
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.020 line:82%
-I'll hear it now.
-My song first.

215
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.610 line:82%
Later, Uncle. Please!

216
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.900 line:82%
See that? You always
drive my audience away.

217
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.730 line:82%
What are you dreaming of?

218
00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.480 line:82%
I was thinking how time
flies so fast.

219
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.150 line:82%
It seems like yesterday that
Mr. Khanna and Geeta had that accident

220
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.150 line:82%
and this ten-year old Pooja came home.

221
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.650 line:82%
And now, it seems as if we
never had a life without her.

222
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.940 line:82%
And I have never seen such
close friends as Pooja and Ajay.

223
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.480 line:82%
Hey, fatty! How are you?

224
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.230 line:82%
Shut up, I'm not fat.

225
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.850 line:82%
I heard these days
you've put on some weight.

226
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.930 line:82%
Don't do that or no
one will marry you!

227
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.650 line:82%
Idiot, you don't worry about it.
Who's going to marry you?

228
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.190 line:82%
By now, you must have finished
cursing me. So I'll proceed.

229
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.900 line:82%
I'm having fun, as usual.
Work and girls are keeping me busy.

230
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.940 line:82%
Tell you what? I never realized how
handsome I am, when I was in India.

231
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.850 line:82%
Don't make faces. If you wish,
I can fax you

232
00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.690 line:82%
a list of my girlfriends.

233
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:00.850 line:82%
No, thank you.

234
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.150 line:82%
For your information
I've broken up with Tina

235
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.900 line:82%
because she
doesn't like Hindi films.

236
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.730 line:82%
Thank God. She was so stupid.

237
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.400 line:82%
-And now I've fallen for someone else.
-Who is she?

238
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.650 line:82%
-Don't yell, I'm telling you.She's Dolly.'
-Dolly?

239
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.020 line:82%
There's no need to worry.
She loves Hindi movies.

240
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.520 line:82%
-Wow!
-Oh, I forgot.

241
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.900 line:82%
-I might come to Bombay for a few days.
-When?

242
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.980 line:82%
No need to stand. Sit down.

243
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.190 line:82%
It's not fixed as yet. As soon
as I get to know, I'll tell you.

244
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.940 line:82%
Okay, I'm off. Dolly
must be on her way.

245
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.270 line:82%
Even though you didn't
say so, I'll convey your love.

246
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.400 line:82%
-There's no need.
-Okay, I won't.

247
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.430 line:82%
Hey. Here she comes.
Okay, I'm going.

248
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.675 line:82%
-Give mom and dad my love. Take care, bye.
'

249
00:19:37.556 --> 00:19:38.750 line:82%
Stupid.

250
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.560 line:82%
Hi. Nisha, where have you put
that cassette you took from my car?

251
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.230 line:82%
There was a vital
music piece of our play.

252
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.560 line:82%
Anything that goes into
your room vanishes forever.

253
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.310 line:82%
Where is the cassette?

254
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.940 line:82%
Rahul, don't you have the manners

255
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.650 line:82%
to knock before coming
into a girl's room.

256
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.020 line:82%
Is there a girl here?

257
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.260 line:82%
I Stop it, Rahul. I'm serious.

258
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.880 line:82%
Look, don't give me all
this girl talk. Please!

259
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.310 line:82%
You have entered my room
when I had nothing on. So?

260
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.260 line:82%
That's different.

261
00:20:12.351 --> 00:20:14.030 line:82%
Why is it different? Don't I feel shy?

262
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.570 line:82%
-Shut up, Rahul
-You shut up!

263
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.690 line:82%
Go on now. Get my cassette.

264
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.850 line:82%
Oh. Thanks

265
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.310 line:82%
First say sorry and then
you'll get the cassette.

266
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.060 line:82%
-Do I have to say sorry?
-Yes.

267
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.230 line:82%
-Say sorry to you?
-Yes.

268
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.310 line:82%
Why you do this Nisha.
Nisha, give it to me.

269
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.850 line:82%
-No stupid games.
-Stupid.

270
00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.850 line:82%
-If I catch you, you're dead.
-I'm not giving it to you.

271
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.270 line:82%
I'll get you. Give back my cassette.

272
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.350 line:82%
Come on, give back my cassette.

273
00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.270 line:82%
-Give it to me.
-I won't!

274
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.940 line:82%
-Give it to me, I say.
-Okay, okay.

275
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.230 line:82%
-Now say you're sorry.
-Sorry for what?

276
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.320 line:82%
Sorry that you've wasted my time,
and made me run around.

277
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.210 line:82%
-I'm not saying sorry.
-You won't!

278
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.850 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-You must never annoy me.

279
00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.110 line:82%
-I'll never annoy you.
-Say 'Rahul is the best'.

280
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.430 line:82%
Never!

281
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.520 line:82%
-Rahul is the best. Okay?
-I know. Thank you very much.

282
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.650 line:82%
Rahul is the worst.
Rahul is a dog, Rahul is a monkey.

283
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.400 line:82%
Come what may, I'm not
going to dance in your play.

284
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.940 line:82%
So be it. I'll find many
dancers like you.

285
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.650 line:82%
There isn't a single
dancer as good as me.

286
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.770 line:82%
Fall in love

287
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.520 line:82%
Fall in love

288
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.150 line:82%
Lose your heart to someone
Fall in love

289
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.850 line:82%
Fall in love

290
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.400 line:82%
You're still young. Someone
out there is meant for you

291
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.230 line:82%
Find him, oh, lovelorn heart

292
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.560 line:82%
Pooja!

293
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.520 line:82%
You are young.
There's somebody for you

294
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.770 line:82%
-My wedding has been fixed.
-Wedding?

295
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.020 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-Six, seven, eight.

296
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.560 line:82%
Fall in love.

297
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.940 line:82%
Fall in love.

298
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.650 line:82%
What's wrong with you, Anjali?

299
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.770 line:82%
You're going to marry
someone, you haven't chosen?

300
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.940 line:82%
Someone you hardly know.

301
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.060 line:82%
I do know him.
He's Mr. Kapoor's son.

302
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.940 line:82%
I've known him for years.

303
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.440 line:82%
But you don't love him.

304
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:15.730 line:82%
Well, Pooja. Love will
happen in due course.

305
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.690 line:82%
Love happens in due course.
Are you saying that, Anjali?

306
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.690 line:82%
We're not kids any more, Pooja.

307
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.730 line:82%
It's time we grow out of
our world of fantasies.

308
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.560 line:82%
We are Indian girls.

309
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.690 line:82%
Our companion for life is never
same as the man in our dreams.

310
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.400 line:82%
We don't even choose him.
Someone else chooses him for us.

311
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.810 line:82%
We learn to love him.

312
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.650 line:82%
This is the truth and it is better
that you realize it soon.

313
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.350 line:82%
Don't make this mistake, Anjali.

314
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.310 line:82%
Someone, somewhere is made for you

315
00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.650 line:82%
and you should wait for him.

316
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.400 line:82%
Perhaps he is the one.

317
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.350 line:82%
I believe that this is the
one who was made for me

318
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.150 line:82%
and I'm going to live
my life with this belief.

319
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.270 line:82%
And who knows?
This might happen even to you.

320
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:21.600 line:82%
In future, you might also marry
a man you hardly know about

321
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:27.730 line:82%
and slowly you might realize that
he was the one you were waiting for.

322
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.310 line:82%
There's someone for you.
You find him out.

323
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.980 line:82%
Nothing like this is going to happen.

324
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.310 line:82%
I'll choose my companion myself.

325
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.730 line:82%
This is impossible, Rahul.
There can't be a girl like this.

326
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.730 line:82%
-What does that mean?
-It's a meaningless character.

327
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.730 line:82%
Maya refuses to come out
of her dreams.

328
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.230 line:82%
Modern girls aren't like this.

329
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.690 line:82%
What do you know?
You're not a even girl.

330
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.690 line:82%
Stop it, Rahul. I'm serious.

331
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.230 line:82%
-Modern girls -Maya is not
one of these modern girls.

332
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.400 line:82%
She's different.

333
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.350 line:82%
She is my Maya.

334
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.480 line:82%
Your Maya, indeed.
What do you know about girls?

335
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.810 line:82%
You know only one. And that's me!

336
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.600 line:82%
What do you mean? I don't
know anything about love

337
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.560 line:82%
and yet I make love stories.
What of it?

338
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.440 line:82%
Rahul, your Maya looks
absolutely crazy to me.

339
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.350 line:82%
Don't you dare to call
my Maya crazy.

340
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.980 line:82%
And you are the only
one who thinks so.

341
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.350 line:82%
-Nobody else talks like this.
-Definitely!

342
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.060 line:82%
-Rahul, I think Nisha is right.
-Thank you.

343
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.480 line:82%
I don't understand 'Maya' either.

344
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.600 line:82%
Her character seems like fake.
Isn't it, Raju?

345
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.560 line:82%
I agree.

346
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.980 line:82%
Looking at it from a psychological
point of view

347
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.900 line:82%
I feel that you're on
your own trip of Utopia.

348
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.100 line:82%
I'm on a fantasy trip.

349
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.100 line:82%
I'm sorry, Maya does
not exist. I'm sorry.

350
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.020 line:82%
-You want to say something too?
-I think we need a lunch break.

351
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.520 line:82%
Exactly. See that.

352
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.480 line:82%
I don't know if such a girl exists
or not and I don't wish to know.

353
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.310 line:82%
Whether she is a lie,
a fantasy or crazy

354
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.350 line:82%
or whatever, she's Maya.

355
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.980 line:82%
If you don't understand this,
I'm very sorry, I can't help it.

356
00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.350 line:82%
But all of you get
one thing straight.

357
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.440 line:82%
I am not going to change
Maya's character, come what may.

358
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.600 line:82%
Excuse me.

359
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.400 line:82%
-What's this?
-I think Rahul is right.

360
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.480 line:82%
You shut up.
You are Rahul's yes-man.

361
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.600 line:82%
-I was saying...
-What were you saying?

362
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.600 line:82%
-Do you know of such a girl?
-No!

363
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.480 line:82%
-Is your Soni like this?
-No.

364
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.400 line:82%
-Can you figure out Maya's character?
-No.

365
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.440 line:82%
-Should we do this play?
-Never.

366
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.730 line:82%
-That's exactly what I've
been saying. -Right, but

367
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:31.980 line:82%
-Not again.
-What's it?

368
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.020 line:82%
-What do you think you are doing?
-Shut up.

369
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.150 line:82%
That innocent face.

370
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.150 line:82%
The mischief in her eyes.

371
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.230 line:82%
Oh my!

372
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.730 line:82%
That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes

373
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.190 line:82%
stands afar shying away.

374
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.900 line:82%
Oh my!

375
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:12.350 line:82%
For a fleeting moment she shows
herself and then turns away

376
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.190 line:82%
Oh my!

377
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.940 line:82%
If you look with my eyes, friend,
you can see her.

378
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.650 line:82%
That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes

379
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.060 line:82%
stands afar shying away.

380
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.400 line:82%
Oh my!

381
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:32.810 line:82%
For a fleeting moment she shows
herself and then turns away

382
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.440 line:82%
Oh my!

383
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.020 line:82%
If you look with my eyes, friend,
you can see her.

384
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.650 line:82%
That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes

385
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.060 line:82%
Oh my!

386
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.440 line:82%
She's no ordinary girl,
she's a wonder.

387
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.850 line:82%
How else can I describe her?

388
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.600 line:82%
Last night she came in my
dreams with her flowing tresses.

389
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.350 line:82%
When I woke up, I wished
I could return to my dream.

390
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.190 line:82%
If this is how I feel
without meeting her

391
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.270 line:82%
what would happen
when I meet her?

392
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.060 line:82%
That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes

393
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.400 line:82%
stands afar shying away.

394
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.100 line:82%
Oh my!

395
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:57.600 line:82%
For a fleeting moment she shows
herself and then turns away.

396
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.520 line:82%
Oh my!

397
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.190 line:82%
If you look with my eyes
you can see her, friend.

398
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:10.770 line:82%
That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes.

399
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.940 line:82%
Oh my!

400
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.520 line:82%
The kohl in her eyes is dark
like the monsoon clouds.

401
00:28:55.270 --> 00:29:00.400 line:82%
Her gait has the grace
of the waves in the ocean

402
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:07.230 line:82%
Wonder what He created her of.

403
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:13.060 line:82%
I wish she appears
before me out of nowhere.

404
00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.730 line:82%
That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes

405
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.060 line:82%
stands afar shying away.

406
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.940 line:82%
Oh my!

407
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:26.230 line:82%
For a fleeting moment she shows
herself and then turns away.

408
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.980 line:82%
Oh my!

409
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.900 line:82%
If you look with my eyes
you can see her, friend.

410
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.730 line:82%
That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes

411
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.850 line:82%
stands afar shying away.

412
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.730 line:82%
Oh my!

413
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.350 line:82%
Oh my!

414
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.230 line:82%
-Yeah!
-Hey, what are you all doing?

415
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.890 line:82%
Rahul, how do you like this?
Hold this.

416
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:56.430 line:82%
Nisha, maybe you didn't notice
that everyone is staring at us.

417
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.430 line:82%
-So what? I don't care.
-But I'm looking funny.

418
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.220 line:82%
Oh come on.
How do you like the orange?

419
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.430 line:82%
-Very nice. Nisha.
-I'll be back in a moment.

420
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.640 line:82%
Nisha.

421
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.180 line:82%
'you are requested to
collect your parcels'

422
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.850 line:82%
'from the delivery counters.'

423
00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.800 line:82%
-Shopping?
-Yes.

424
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.720 line:82%
-Alone?
-Yes.

425
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.100 line:82%
Very good! Never make the mistake
of shopping with a girl.

426
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.390 line:82%
-How do you like this shirt? Cool?
-You like it?

427
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.890 line:82%
-I really like it.
-I love it! Let's go.

428
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:28.140 line:82%
-Try it on once.
-Both of us like it. Let's go.

429
00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.350 line:82%
-Rahul.
-To hell with Rahul!

430
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.140 line:82%
-So sweet!
-What did you say?

431
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.010 line:82%
Nothing, nothing at all.
Off you go!

432
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:40.100 line:82%
Who is it?

433
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.720 line:82%
Sorry! Idiot.

434
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.890 line:82%
Okay? Happy?

435
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.350 line:82%
Why are you laughing?
What's up?

436
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.300 line:82%
Where are your jeans?

437
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.970 line:82%
I'm wearing it.

438
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.470 line:82%
It happens.

439
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.390 line:82%
Who is it?

440
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.050 line:82%
Crazy!

441
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.930 line:82%
Happy birthday to you.

442
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.180 line:82%
Happy birthday to you.

443
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.640 line:82%
Happy birthday to you.

444
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.260 line:82%
Happy birthday.

445
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:43.470 line:82%
-Everybody clap Open the cake box.
-Hey.

446
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.470 line:82%
Pooja. How did this happen?

447
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.140 line:82%
What happened and
when did it happen?

448
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.140 line:82%
How did this get swapped over?
I had ordered a chocolate cake.

449
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.760 line:82%
You must have picked up
someone else's parcel.

450
00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.640 line:82%
I'm so stupid! I should've checked.

451
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.850 line:82%
-I'm sorry, uncle.
-It's all right, dear.

452
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.930 line:82%
Other people celebrate their
birthdays by cutting a cake.

453
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.640 line:82%
I'll celebrate mine by cutting
sandwiches. No big deal.

454
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.850 line:82%
Come on. Come on.

455
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.050 line:82%
-Let me see who got my cake.
-Where are the candles?

456
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.970 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Pooja

457
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.140 line:82%
-Who's Pooja?
-I don't know.

458
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.890 line:82%
-And who's uncle?
-Must be Pooja's uncle.

459
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.970 line:82%
I sent you on an errand for the first
time and you picked the wrong parcel.

460
00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.470 line:82%
What did I do? I got the
parcel the shopkeeper gave me.

461
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.260 line:82%
But you should have checked.

462
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.430 line:82%
Excuse me, but it wasn't up
to me to check.

463
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.390 line:82%
Next time, do it yourself. Okay?

464
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.640 line:82%
I'm hungry and this cake
looks awesome. Let's dig in.

465
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.390 line:82%
Stop it. No one's eating this cake.

466
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.180 line:82%
-Why not?
-It belongs to someone else.

467
00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.850 line:82%
They must be eating
our sandwiches.

468
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:46.930 line:82%
There's an address written here.
It's nearby. Go and return it.

469
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.100 line:82%
Are you nuts?

470
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.850 line:82%
This is someone's birthday cake
ordered with love.

471
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.930 line:82%
Someone's party will be ruined.
Give it back.

472
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.390 line:82%
I'm not going.

473
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.220 line:82%
-Rahul
-To hell with Rahul!

474
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.260 line:82%
Jimmy, let's go and return it
and say 'Happy Birthday’. Come on.

475
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.350 line:82%
-So sweet!
-What did you say?

476
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:04.550 line:82%
Nothing.

477
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.140 line:82%
Shut up!

478
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.720 line:82%
Yes?

479
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.430 line:82%
Good evening. Are you the uncle?

480
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.970 line:82%
No, I'm aunty.

481
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.140 line:82%
Actually, by mistake I got
your cake, aunty.

482
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.350 line:82%
-The sandwich man.
-That's right.

483
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:25.640 line:82%
Here's your cake and
wishing you a happy birthday.

484
00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.680 line:82%
Thank you and sorry.

485
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.890 line:82%
-Why sorry? -Because we've
eaten all your sandwiches.

486
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:36.600 line:82%
That's all right. Actually, I ate
a bit of your cake on the way here.

487
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.470 line:82%
-No wonder!
-Yes.

488
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.640 line:82%
-Okay, I'll be off Uncle.
-No. Come in and have some cake.

489
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.760 line:82%
No thanks. I'm in a hurry.
Some other time.

490
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.600 line:82%
Just a minute. Just
one minute, please.

491
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.390 line:82%
Let the person who bought
this cake thank you.

492
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:51.550 line:82%
-There's no need.
-No, no!

493
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.140 line:82%
-Uncle.
-Pooja, Pooja.

494
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.850 line:82%
-Pooja, Pooja.
-Yes, Uncle.

495
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:59.430 line:82%
That poor man, whose sandwiches
you picked up by mistake

496
00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.550 line:82%
-has brought the cake back.
-How sweet!

497
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.350 line:82%
-He's at the door. Go and thank him.
-Okay.

498
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:06.140 line:82%
-Thank him.
-Okay.

499
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:11.100 line:82%
The cake has brought
a twinkle in my eyes

500
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.640 line:82%
and a musical rhythm to
the strings of my stomach.

501
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.680 line:82%
The cake is here.

502
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.180 line:82%
To fit or not to fit.
Not to fit.

503
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:27.930 line:82%
What a fool!

504
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.720 line:82%
'We welcome you.'

505
00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.680 line:82%
'Happy Valentine's Day.'

506
00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.430 line:82%
Why are you buying all this stuff?

507
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.180 line:82%
Come on, Anjali. It's
Valentine's Day today.

508
00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.600 line:82%
Valentine's day!

509
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:08.970 line:82%
-What is this Valentine's day?
-Don't you know?

510
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.720 line:82%
The one you love most in the
world is called your Valentine.

511
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:16.430 line:82%
On this day, all lovers pour
their hearts out to each other.

512
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.140 line:82%
This is all about love.
You won't understand.

513
00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.300 line:82%
Very funny! But whom are you
buying all these things for?

514
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.970 line:82%
-For myself.
-What?

515
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.890 line:82%
Look, I don't have a lover who'd
buy me all these lovely things.

516
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.640 line:82%
So I'm pleasing myself.

517
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.350 line:82%
You've lost it.

518
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:36.430 line:82%
Do you know that today is not
a ordinary Valentine's Day?

519
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.680 line:82%
It falls on the same
day as the full moon.

520
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.100 line:82%
Know what this means?

521
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.800 line:82%
I don't know but I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

522
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.140 line:82%
It means that if you believe
that someone is made for you

523
00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.350 line:82%
and you are waiting
for him with a true heart

524
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.180 line:82%
you would certainly
meet him today.

525
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.800 line:82%
And you really believe this?

526
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.140 line:82%
Of course. I'm absolutely sure

527
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.800 line:82%
that before midnight
I shall meet my soul mate.

528
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:04.550 line:82%
-Pooja, you're really mad.
-That I am.

529
00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.300 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Forget Rahul!

530
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.260 line:82%
I'm going home. You can
come along.

531
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.550 line:82%
Rahul, we came together
and will go together.

532
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.890 line:82%
This is a very boring party.
Tell me if you want to come.

533
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.600 line:82%
Rahul, when will you grow up?

534
00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.890 line:82%
Look, how beautiful the night is,
and you're so unromantic.

535
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.720 line:82%
Just look at those couples.
They look so lovely

536
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.300 line:82%
dancing in each other's arms.

537
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.180 line:82%
-You think that they're all in love.
-Of course.

538
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.760 line:82%
Sit down.

539
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:59.390 line:82%
Tell me something, Nisha.
What do you think? What is love?

540
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.930 line:82%
It is love when you're
so fond of someone

541
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.300 line:82%
that you want to spend the
rest of your life in his arms.

542
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.680 line:82%
That's what we call love.

543
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.550 line:82%
I see. You think all
these people here

544
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.760 line:82%
want to spend the rest of
their lives with each other.

545
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.140 line:82%
I think so.

546
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.050 line:82%
Girls are so dumb.

547
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:24.010 line:82%
Do you know, most of these romances
would be over before the night ends?

548
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.890 line:82%
They'll fight over small things

549
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.050 line:82%
and will never see
each other after tonight.

550
00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.720 line:82%
And next year,
you will see the same faces

551
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.010 line:82%
at the same place
but in different arms.

552
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.680 line:82%
-Boys are so stupid.
-I'm telling you the truth, Nisha.

553
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.800 line:82%
You must agree that you need
to know someone really well

554
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.720 line:82%
-to spend your life together.
-That's right.

555
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.680 line:82%
And in order to know someone well
you need to spend time together?

556
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.600 line:82%
-True. -In today's times,
who has the time?

557
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.010 line:82%
Look. In this party,
no one's known each other

558
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.800 line:82%
for as long as we've
known each other.

559
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.470 line:82%
Does that mean that we can spend
a lifetime with each other?

560
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:06.260 line:82%
Let me put it this way. Will you
be able to spend a lifetime with me?

561
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.140 line:82%
Here you are, Rahul.
And everyone wants you outside!

562
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.180 line:82%
-Why? -Nothing as such.
Everyone wants a song from you.

563
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.930 line:82%
-Oh no -Oh, come on.
-I don't want to sing.

564
00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:22.800 line:82%
'Tell me, will you be able
to spend a lifetime with me?'

565
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.390 line:82%
Yes Rahul, I can.

566
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:31.140 line:82%
I could spend my whole life
with you.

567
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.010 line:82%
Rahul, Rahul, Rahul, Rahul.

568
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.510 line:82%
Rahul, Rahul, Rahul, Rahul.

569
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.140 line:82%
Rahul, Rahul, Rahul, Rahul.

570
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.180 line:82%
The moon whispered something

571
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.550 line:82%
which the night heard

572
00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:41.640 line:82%
The moon whispered something,
which the night heard.

573
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.510 line:82%
Did you hear that?

574
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.930 line:82%
Fall in love.

575
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:55.510 line:82%
The moonlight came to say

576
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.510 line:82%
The moonlight came

577
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.550 line:82%
to my street and
to my house, to say

578
00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.180 line:82%
Fall in love.

579
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:12.100 line:82%
The moon whispered something

580
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.800 line:82%
which the night heard.

581
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.680 line:82%
Did you hear that?

582
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:22.350 line:82%
Fall in love.

583
00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:56.430 line:82%
What can I say, what can I do?

584
00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:01.550 line:82%
This strange thing
has happened to me.

585
00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:07.260 line:82%
Is it a sign or did
my heart whisper?

586
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:12.850 line:82%
Is it a sign or did
my heart whisper?

587
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.260 line:82%
Don't shy away from it.

588
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.390 line:82%
Fall in love.

589
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.930 line:82%
The moon whispered something

590
00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.680 line:82%
which the night heard.

591
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.470 line:82%
Did you hear that?

592
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.760 line:82%
Fall in love.

593
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:25.470 line:82%
I don't know who it is, but I am
certain that there's someone.

594
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:30.680 line:82%
He is somewhere in my dreams,
but I cannot see him.

595
00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:36.470 line:82%
I'm here and he's somewhere there.

596
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:42.010 line:82%
I am here and he is somewhere there.

597
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.550 line:82%
But whose voice
is this that says

598
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:46.600 line:82%
Fall in love.

599
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.260 line:82%
Fall in love.

600
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.890 line:82%
The moon whispered something

601
00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:55.680 line:82%
which the night heard.

602
00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:58.470 line:82%
Did you hear that?

603
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.760 line:82%
Fall in love.

604
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:42.430 line:82%
My love is oblivious to the one
to whom I lost my heart and soul.

605
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:53.430 line:82%
My love is oblivious to the one
to whom I lost my heart and soul.

606
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:58.800 line:82%
But I can't complain.
I can't call him unfaithful.

607
00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:04.800 line:82%
I heard the words
which he never spoke.

608
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.390 line:82%
Oh, my heart,
be careful while you

609
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.680 line:82%
Fall in love.

610
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.720 line:82%
The moon whispered something

611
00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:29.550 line:82%
which the night heard

612
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.300 line:82%
Did you hear that?

613
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.970 line:82%
Fall in love.

614
00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:43.350 line:82%
The moonlight came to say

615
00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.140 line:82%
The moonlight came.

616
00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:51.300 line:82%
To my street and to
my house to say

617
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:56.010 line:82%
Fall in love.

618
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:12.600 line:82%
Fall in love.

619
00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:18.220 line:82%
Fall in love.

620
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:24.180 line:82%
Happy Valentine's Day.
Dance. Dance.

621
00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.350 line:82%
-Hello?
-Have you lost it?

622
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:34.390 line:82%
Are you out of your mind? Why did
you leave without telling anyone?

623
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:36.550 line:82%
You said we'd leave together.

624
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.760 line:82%
Then you ran away.

625
00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.220 line:82%
You know that we're all worried.

626
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.680 line:82%
Idiot. Stupid. Fool.

627
00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.970 line:82%
Hello?

628
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:48.720 line:82%
This is not 6711237, is it?

629
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.100 line:82%
-No.
-I thought so.

630
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.600 line:82%
I'm sorry, I thought
it was someone else.

631
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.600 line:82%
You're right. I am someone else.

632
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.600 line:82%
I'm really sorry.
Please excuse me.

633
00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.760 line:82%
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

634
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.930 line:82%
-Hang on, one minute.
Don't hang up, please. -Yes?

635
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:06.890 line:82%
The music you're playing

636
00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.470 line:82%
that's Pt. Shiv Kumar
Sharma's latest album, isn't it?

637
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.680 line:82%
-Yes.
-I thought so.

638
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.680 line:82%
You know, I wanted to buy it too.
Where did you buy it from?

639
00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.680 line:82%
-From Rhythm House.
-I haven't been there.

640
00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.680 line:82%
Do you think
they'd have it in stock?

641
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.220 line:82%
How would I know?

642
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.300 line:82%
I'm so stupid. How would you know?
You don't work there, right?

643
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:29.390 line:82%
I'm really sorry about all this.

644
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:30.890 line:82%
-It's okay.
-Good night

645
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.600 line:82%
-Good night.
-I'm very sorry.

646
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.930 line:82%
-It's okay.
-Happy Valentine's.

647
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.220 line:82%
Happy Valentine's.

648
00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.390 line:82%
Nice voice.

649
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.650 line:82%
That's all, Mr. Simpson

650
00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.320 line:82%
Okay, I'll try meeting you.

651
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.400 line:82%
I'll do that.

652
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.360 line:82%
Tell him not to worry about it.

653
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.650 line:82%
Okay. All right, see you.

654
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:45.030 line:82%
Ajay!

655
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.490 line:82%
Ajay, you idiot.

656
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.700 line:82%
How dare you do this to me?
You scared the hell out of me.

657
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.860 line:82%
How far will you run?

658
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:55.110 line:82%
-Wait till I get you.
-There comes the fatty.

659
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.450 line:82%
How dare you call me fatty?
You dared to scare me.

660
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.820 line:82%
-Move aside, Uncle.
-Take this.

661
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.490 line:82%
Catch me if you can, fatty.

662
00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.860 line:82%
You called me fatty again?
Aunt, look at him.

663
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:09.280 line:82%
Aunt!

664
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.070 line:82%
Wait till I get you.

665
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.570 line:82%
Tired?

666
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.490 line:82%
Shall we?

667
00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:54.650 line:82%
Cut it!

668
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.650 line:82%
-Ballu! What are you up to?
-Why, what's wrong, Rahul?

669
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.610 line:82%
The spotlight should move from
me to Nisha after the drum roll.

670
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.570 line:82%
-And I thought
-Shut up.

671
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.150 line:82%
Come on, Nisha. Do it again.

672
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.490 line:82%
Let's take it from the top.

673
00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:09.650 line:82%
-Rahul
-Rahul's done for! What is it?

674
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.570 line:82%
-Please pack up early.
-Why? What's special?

675
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.150 line:82%
-Nothing. Come on. -Come on,
let's take it from the top.

676
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.150 line:82%
Rahul, you forgot?
It's Nisha's birthday.

677
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.400 line:82%
-Really? Why didn't someone tell me?
-Yes.

678
00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.740 line:82%
-Nisha, what's wrong?
-Catch it. Thanks.

679
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.240 line:82%
Why didn't you tell me?

680
00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:32.400 line:82%
There are some things which one
should know without being told, Rahul.

681
00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.530 line:82%
And yet, you should've said something.

682
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.740 line:82%
Honestly, you guys are the limit.

683
00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.780 line:82%
-Rahul! Just relax!
-I'm very angry.

684
00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.360 line:82%
-Rahul! Just relax.
-I am very angry.

685
00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:45.360 line:82%
You've been forgetting it all these
years. This is just another year.

686
00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:50.200 line:82%
Drop that stupid face and take us
all out to dinner. Come on.

687
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.030 line:82%
-Yeah!
-Come on guys, let's go.

688
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:53.240 line:82%
Nisha.

689
00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:55.530 line:82%
What is it?

690
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:58.240 line:82%
Happy birthday.

691
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.200 line:82%
You remembered?
Why didn't you say it?

692
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.400 line:82%
There are some things which
one knows without being told.

693
00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:09.280 line:82%
-You idiot! Thank you.
-It's okay, Nisha. -Yes.

694
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.360 line:82%
-Let's rehearse.
-Rahul.

695
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.530 line:82%
Just joking. Come on, everybody.

696
00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.990 line:82%
-Then she didn't agree at all.
-So sweet.

697
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.650 line:82%
-Cheers!
-Okay, everybody. Tequila time.

698
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.950 line:82%
Rahul, I want the bigger one.

699
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:31.030 line:82%
Yes, the largest one for you, Raju.

700
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:34.110 line:82%
-Okay, Jimmy.
-What are you drinking?

701
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.400 line:82%
Tequila.

702
00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:38.700 line:82%
-I want some. -This isn't for girls.
Go and have a soft drink.

703
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:41.700 line:82%
-No, I want some.
-I told you. This is not for you.

704
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.200 line:82%
It's my birthday today.

705
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.650 line:82%
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

706
00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.950 line:82%
I'll do as I please.

707
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:51.490 line:82%
Nisha. Okay, suit yourself. Pepsi.

708
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:53.070 line:82%
Give me another glass.

709
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:55.450 line:82%
So sweet. Nothing.

710
00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.610 line:82%
You're in love?

711
00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.860 line:82%
Give it. I know your kind of love.

712
00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.400 line:82%
It changes every week.

713
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.900 line:82%
This is your kind of love,
not mine.

714
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:05.740 line:82%
You mean, the marrying kind?

715
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:07.650 line:82%
Really?

716
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:10.240 line:82%
Who's the girl? Do I know her?

717
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.780 line:82%
Really well.

718
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.070 line:82%
Tell me who she is, please.

719
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.240 line:82%
Ajay.

720
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.360 line:82%
-Must I?
-Yes.

721
00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.650 line:82%
-Forget it.
-Ajay. -That hurts.

722
00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:27.820 line:82%
Okay! One, two, three, go!

723
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.280 line:82%
Didn't I tell you?
It's not for girls.

724
00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.950 line:82%
One more.

725
00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.030 line:82%
Rahul's finished.

726
00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.860 line:82%
Please, Ajay. Tell me who she is.

727
00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:51.650 line:82%
-Okay, let's do this.
See that waiter? -Which one?

728
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.150 line:82%
-The one serving water.
-Yes.

729
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:55.700 line:82%
Keep looking at him.

730
00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.150 line:82%
If there's still a glass
of water on that tray

731
00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:02.490 line:82%
by the time he gets to our
table then I'll tell you her name.

732
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.400 line:82%
-Promise?
-Promise.

733
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:06.150 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

734
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.360 line:82%
Oh, my God. Excuse me.
A glass of water, please.

735
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:19.740 line:82%
-That's cheating.
-So what?

736
00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.570 line:82%
-You can't.
-Everything is fair in love and war.

737
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.820 line:82%
-Look. Look
-Thank you!

738
00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.820 line:82%
Everything is fair in love and war.

739
00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:27.320 line:82%
You idiot.

740
00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:30.950 line:82%
Nisha, please. Nisha!

741
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:37.820 line:82%
-I feel lonely -Nisha,
shut up! -Rahul is a bad boy.

742
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.780 line:82%
Nisha, please. Shut up now.

743
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:43.820 line:82%
Yes.

744
00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:49.030 line:82%
Don't say a word.
Say nothing at all.

745
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:53.150 line:82%
-Take my shoes and give me money.
-Please go to sleep, Nisha.

746
00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.860 line:82%
-Take the shoes and give
me money. -What nonsense!

747
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:59.150 line:82%
Go to sleep. Good night.

748
00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.780 line:82%
I'm scared, Rahul.
Don't leave me, I'm scared.

749
00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:12.950 line:82%
It's really late. Now quietly
go to sleep. Good night.

750
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:17.150 line:82%
No. First promise me
that you won't leave me.

751
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.110 line:82%
Okay, fine.
I won't leave you alone.

752
00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:24.860 line:82%
You won't leave me, even if
I ask for an ice-cream, will you?

753
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.740 line:82%
No, I won't.

754
00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:32.030 line:82%
You won't leave me, even if
I don't dance well, will you?

755
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:33.320 line:82%
No, I won't.

756
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:39.610 line:82%
Not even if I call you names
like donkey, monkey, will you?

757
00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.280 line:82%
Of course, I won't leave you.

758
00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:47.950 line:82%
You won't leave me, even if I
tell you that I love you, will you?

759
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.070 line:82%
I love you, Rahul.

760
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:54.280 line:82%
I really love you, Rahul.

761
00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:03.650 line:82%
I love you.

762
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.240 line:82%
Pooja!

763
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:31.570 line:82%
There she is still asleep!

764
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:35.240 line:82%
Come on, Pooja. It's 7:00am

765
00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.900 line:82%
The sun is up, Pooja.

766
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.490 line:82%
Pooja.

767
00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.570 line:82%
What is it? What is it?

768
00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.700 line:82%
You? You idiot. Is this the way
to wake someone up?

769
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:04.700 line:82%
I'm so sorry, but seeing you fast
asleep, I just couldn't resist it.

770
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.950 line:82%
How could I miss out
on such an opportunity?

771
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:10.360 line:82%
-You idiot. Stupid.
-I'm sorry sorry, sorry

772
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:14.610 line:82%
Listen, get ready quickly.
We've got to go to the airport.

773
00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.030 line:82%
Airport? Are you going somewhere?

774
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:20.400 line:82%
No. We are.

775
00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.360 line:82%
We? And where are we going?

776
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:24.450 line:82%
Well, that's a surprise.

777
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:27.360 line:82%
It's not far from India,
it's nearby.

778
00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:30.110 line:82%
We'll return by tonight's flight.
Get ready quickly.

779
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.900 line:82%
I don't get you.

780
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:36.450 line:82%
Silly. It's very simple.
I have to go on some business.

781
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:38.950 line:82%
It'll take me just an hour
to just sign some papers

782
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.530 line:82%
and then I am free.

783
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:43.610 line:82%
If you come along,
you'll see a new city

784
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.950 line:82%
and do shopping.

785
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:46.990 line:82%
And anyway I'm leaving
for London tomorrow.

786
00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.700 line:82%
That leaves only today

787
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.200 line:82%
which I want to spend with you.
So simple.

788
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.030 line:82%
But Ajay, I must find out if
it's okay with uncle and aunt.

789
00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:57.950 line:82%
I've already got their approval.
It's only you who has to decide.

790
00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:01.450 line:82%
So fatty, are you coming or not?

791

Hurry up, get ready.
The flight is on time.

793
00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:07.450 line:82%
Wait a minute. What's
that under your eye?

794
00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:08.700 line:82%
-Where?
-There.

795
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:12.200 line:82%
Now wait, you fatty!
Stop there, fatty!

796
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.700 line:82%
-Never mind. I'll get you for this.
-Come and get me.

797
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.450 line:82%
Oh!

798
00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:23.200 line:82%
You're going shopping, aren't you?
We'll see.

803
00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:10.570 line:82%
It shows them the path of love.

804
00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:14.780 line:82%
It brings joys and tears as well.

805

It gives you real
and unreal dreams.

810

813

Those who follow the heart

814
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.610 line:82%
become crazy as well.

815
01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:37.490 line:82%
The eternal traveler
finds his destination

816
01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:41.240 line:82%
but loses track of the
paths that led him there.

817

The heart is crazy,
the heart is besotted.

819
01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.820 line:82%
I wouldn't recognize him by face

820
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.150 line:82%
nor would I know him by name.

821
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.490 line:82%
I wouldn't think twice

822
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:16.030 line:82%
before I blindly follow my heart.

823
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:20.320 line:82%
The heart is crazy,
the heart is besotted.

824

The heart is crazy,
the heart is besotted.

825
01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:21.780 line:82%
We all heed the heart

826
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:26.200 line:82%
but the heart heeds no one.

827
01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.215 line:82%
The world knows I lost myself

828
01:02:30.366 --> 01:02:34.070 line:82%
to him but he doesn't.

829
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:38.070 line:82%
The heart is crazy,
the heart is besotted.

830

The heart is crazy,
the heart is besotted.

831

So be the tales of love,

the face of this earth

834

are the graces of
this unreasonable heart.

Pooja, I want to tell you something.

850
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.430 line:82%
Tell me. What is it?

851
01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:38.680 line:82%
This quick business trip of
a couple of days was all a pretence.

852

It's been eight years

I've earned enough
of respect and money.

I've had enough of all this.

I don't know how or when

you turned to love.

No, Anjali. The girl has
become a woman

900
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:26.130 line:82%
but she hasn't given up
her dreams.

901
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:30.090 line:82%
She believes in them completely
even now.

902

-Hi, Doctor.
-There's no need to worry.

911
01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.340 line:82%
It's a small fracture.
She'll go home in a week or so.

912

I told you Nisha would start
dancing again in a week.

913
01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:35.750 line:82%
I'm talking about going home,
not dancing.

914
01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.880 line:82%
She can't dance for
another three months.

915
01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.090 line:82%
-Three months?
-Yes, Rahul.

916
01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:41.920 line:82%
Her heel is very delicate.

917
01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:45.710 line:82%
If she doesn't take care,
the fracture could recur

918
01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:48.300 line:82%
and it could be more serious.

919
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.840 line:82%
-Does she know this?
-Yes. -May I see her?

920
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.590 line:82%
-Of course. You don't need my
permission. -Thank you, Doctor.

to knock, will you?

924
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:05.590 line:82%
Don't give me that girl talk.

925
01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:07.800 line:82%
I have something very
important to discuss.

926
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.000 line:82%
-Yes, tell me. -Can you see
me properly? How many fingers?

927
01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:14.750 line:82%
-Stop it, Rahul.
-Jokes apart..

928
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.840 line:82%
Okay! Look, this Dr. Kapoor
of yours isn't good.

929
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.380 line:82%
-I think you should see
some other doctor. -Why?

930
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.920 line:82%
This doctor talked about
discharging you in a week.

931
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.130 line:82%
-So what?
-No, it's not done.

932
01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:29.500 line:82%
It's been such a task
getting you to the hospital.

933
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:31.750 line:82%
You should spend at least
a month or two here.

934
01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.590 line:82%
-Meaning! -And while you are away,
we'll also have some peace.

935
01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:38.000 line:82%
-Rahul, I hate you.
You're so horrible. -Slowly

936
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:40.800 line:82%
You're always making fun of me.
I hate you. You're so bad.

937
01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.300 line:82%
Nisha, behave yourself.
Sorry.

938
01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.500 line:82%
The pain has got her mad.

939
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:45.710 line:82%
Don't worry, I'll take care.
I'm a psychologist.

940
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.960 line:82%
-Sis
-Rahul.

941
01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:49.210 line:82%
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

942
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:50.750 line:82%
For what?

943
01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.500 line:82%
I've put you through
so much trouble.

944
01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:58.090 line:82%
You've taken so much
money from the sponsors

945
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.550 line:82%
and how would you
find a dancer so soon?

946
01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.380 line:82%
-And for three months, I
-Now look.

947
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.840 line:82%
There's no need for you to worry.

948
01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.090 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Rahul's finished!

949
01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:11.170 line:82%
You think you are a good dancer.

950
01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.800 line:82%
There are scores of
fabulous dancers in town.

951
01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:17.210 line:82%
-Sure, but you'll never find
-A dancer like you, right?

952
01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.710 line:82%
-Right.
-Now you don't worry about this.

953
01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.840 line:82%
Now get some rest and
I'll see you in the evening.

954
01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.670 line:82%
-Okay. -And you don't need
to eat the boring hospital food.

955
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.750 line:82%
I'll bring some food.
We'll eat together.

956
01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.300 line:82%
It's a deal. Right?

957
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:33.550 line:82%
-Bye.
-Bye.

958
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:38.130 line:82%
-Rahul.
-I know. Chinese, right?

959
01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.340 line:82%
Right.

960
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:45.320 line:82%
-Not to worry. It will all work out.
-How will it all work out?

961
01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.800 line:82%
We borrowed money
from the sponsors

962
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.090 line:82%
and paid it for the stadium.

963
01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.550 line:82%
Where are we going to find
a dancer like Nisha?

964
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:53.840 line:82%
Come on, if we try, don't you
think we can find one good dancer?

965
01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.800 line:82%
There are plenty of dance schools.

966
01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.960 line:82%
One is right next to
our rehearsal hall.

967
01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:59.710 line:82%
We'll find a dancer there tomorrow.

968
01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.090 line:82%
Yes! Yes, Jimmy. You're right.

969
01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:04.840 line:82%
How about that, Rahul?
Come on, relax.

970
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.750 line:82%
Whatever happens
will be for the best.

971
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.590 line:82%
Let's go and have
some chilled beer.

972
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:11.210 line:82%
-No You go ahead. I'm not
in the mood. -Come on, buddy!

973
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.420 line:82%
Relax, pal. Try to understand.
He's tired.

974
01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.210 line:82%
-We'll push off.
-See you. Take care.

975
01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.250 line:82%
-Bye, bye.
-Come on, Supandi. -I'll see you.

976
01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.670 line:82%
First you give me your
address and phone number.

977
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:22.750 line:82%
Maya

978
01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:26.300 line:82%
I'll find her.

979
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:08.710 line:82%
Maya.

980
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:39.500 line:82%
Water, water.

981
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:44.090 line:82%
-Water, water in my eyes.
-Excuse me

982
01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.060 line:82%
The sandwich man.

983
01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:49.000 line:82%
-Shanti, did we receive any parcel?
-No.

984
01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:52.330 line:82%
-I haven't come for a parcel today.
-Then tell me what I can do for you.

985
01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:55.800 line:82%
-I want to meet your daughter.
-I don't have a daughter.

986
01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:57.270 line:82%
-No daughter?
-No.

987
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:59.750 line:82%
Then sir, Ms. Pooja Malhotra?

988
01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.590 line:82%
-Pooja is like my daughter.
-I see.

989
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:05.130 line:82%
But how do you know her?

990
01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:08.310 line:82%
-I saw her last night.
-Night?

991
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:12.020 line:82%
-Where?
-In the dancing school.

992
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.300 line:82%
-She dances really well.
-So?

993
01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:16.670 line:82%
-So I wanted to meet her.
-What for?

994
01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:19.500 line:82%
-I wanted to ask her something.
-What?

995
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:22.880 line:82%
-If she'd sort of...
-What with you?

996
01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.300 line:82%
-If she'd work with me.
-What work?

997
01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:31.380 line:82%
-I do plays and I'm looking for a dancer.
-You are doing a play.

998
01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:32.880 line:82%
Yes.

999
01:17:33.090 --> 01:17:36.090 line:82%
-Are you a director?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

1000
01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:39.000 line:82%
I'm sorry.
Why didn't you tell me before?

1001
01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:42.670 line:82%
-I did, when you asked me.
-I'm sorry. Come in.

1002
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.170 line:82%
-Actually, I'm a singer.
-I see.

1003
01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:48.500 line:82%
I am practising for many years. Sit.

1004
01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.320 line:82%
As it happens with
many great artistes

1005
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.590 line:82%
you don't really meet
too many connoisseurs.

1006
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:59.090 line:82%
You've met me today.
You don't know how lucky you are.

1007
01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:01.630 line:82%
I know but I've come
to meet Pooja, sir.

1008
01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:04.590 line:82%
Now that you have met me,
you'll meet Pooja too.

1009
01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:06.550 line:82%
I won't give you a penny
more than 75.

1010
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:10.250 line:82%
The prices have gone up, ma'am.
Rs.80 and no less.

1011
01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.790 line:82%
Only last week I bought it
at that price.

1012
01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.210 line:82%
Have the prices risen so soon?

1013
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:16.410 line:82%
Trust me, ma'am.
That's the correct price.

1014
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.600 line:82%
You can only taste
how sweet it is.

1015
01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.140 line:82%
-I will give you Rs.75 and no more.
-Seventy five

1016
01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:23.630 line:82%
-Show me the watermelon.
-Here you are, sir.

1017
01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:29.960 line:82%
Seventy-five is apt.
How many, ma'am?

1018
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:32.080 line:82%
-Just one.
-Pack this for Ma'am.

1019
01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:34.090 line:82%
-But
-Oh, come on!

1020
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.880 line:82%
Your first sale,
and you're haggling for five bucks?

1021
01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.600 line:82%
Come on, give it
to ma'am. I'm there.

1022
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:45.340 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

1023
01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.170 line:82%
Recognize me?

1024
01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:50.000 line:82%
We met last night at
your dancing school.

1025
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:51.840 line:82%
-You remember?
-Oh, yes.

1026
01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.960 line:82%
I'm Rahul.
You must've heard of me?

1027
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:56.800 line:82%
No.

1028
01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:58.510 line:82%
Well, never mind.

1029
01:18:58.711 --> 01:19:01.950 line:82%
Actually, you are a pretty good dancer.

1030
01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:03.590 line:82%
Thank you.

1031
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.980 line:82%
Actually, I'm doing
some musical shows

1032
01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.500 line:82%
and I need a special
dancer for a special role.

1033
01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.130 line:82%
When I saw you dancing yesterday

1034
01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:16.420 line:82%
I thought that
you'd be ideal for this.

1035
01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:21.250 line:82%
So what do you think?
Would you be interested?

1036
01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.590 line:82%
No, thanks.

1037
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.090 line:82%
Rahul is finished.

1038
01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:27.300 line:82%
Sir, watermelon!

1039
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.660 line:82%
My career's at stake
and you talk of the watermelon!

1040
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:30.800 line:82%
Take this watermelon.

1041
01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.550 line:82%
Excuse me, but perhaps
you misunderstand me.

1042
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:37.300 line:82%
The shows I'm talking
about are no ordinary shows.

1043
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.460 line:82%
Here I am.

1044
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:42.000 line:82%
They're high-class shows with
a very high-class audience

1045
01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:44.090 line:82%
and I am sure you
would also enjoy doing it.

1046
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:46.050 line:82%
Why don't you give it a try?

1047
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:48.460 line:82%
Not for me but at least
for the sake of art.

1048
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:52.390 line:82%
-Dancing is my hobby.
-That's really good.

1049
01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:55.660 line:82%
But dancing on stage in front
of an audience makes me nervous.

1050
01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:58.360 line:82%
-What's there to be nervous?
-I don't think I can do it.

1051
01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:01.420 line:82%
-No, no.
-No problem. Just

1052
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:04.250 line:82%
Take three.

1053
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.420 line:82%
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1054
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.850 line:82%
Look, I'm in a tight spot.

1055
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:13.110 line:82%
Actually, my lead dancer
has fractured her foot.

1056
01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:14.740 line:82%
I've borrowed money
for the show.

1057
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:17.340 line:82%
If we don't perform, I'll lose face too.

1058
01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:21.090 line:82%
Just come once for a rehearsal,
and if you don't like it, it's fine.

1059
01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:24.320 line:82%
But please, just once.
Please come to the rehearsal.

1060
01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.210 line:82%
-I'm really very sorry. I can't do it.
-Please.

1061
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.100 line:82%
-Please.
-Why don't you hire someone else?

1062
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:32.860 line:82%
-I beg of you, please.
-What are you doing?

1063
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:35.150 line:82%
You don't know me.
I'm a stubborn and crazy guy.

1064
01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.690 line:82%
-I'll not budge.
-Get up.

1065
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:37.780 line:82%
Do come to the rehearsal.

1066
01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.280 line:82%
-Don't come back if unwilling.
-All eyes are on us.

1067
01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:40.630 line:82%
Please come just once!

1068
01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:42.840 line:82%
-Okay. I'll come. Promise.
-You will? Promise?

1069
01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.340 line:82%
-When? What time?
-Tomorrow.

1070
01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.750 line:82%
-2:00pm.
-Can't you come at one?

1071
01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:47.630 line:82%
-Okay, I'll come at one.
-Thanks.

1072
01:20:47.741 --> 01:20:49.420 line:82%
Thank you for all this.

1073
01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:51.810 line:82%
I hope you know that

1074
01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.420 line:82%
our rehearsal hall is
next to the school.

1075
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.800 line:82%
-I know. I know.
-We're neighbours, you know.

1076
01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.500 line:82%
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1077
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.090 line:82%
Ma'am.

1078
01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:04.300 line:82%
You'll come, won't you?

1079
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:07.250 line:82%
Yes, you will.

1080
01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:10.460 line:82%
Ma'am.

1081
01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:13.170 line:82%
Yes.

1082
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.130 line:82%
For you. Yes.

1083
01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:22.420 line:82%
He's crazy.

1084
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:28.380 line:82%
-How is this sketch?
-Not that good. This one's better.

1085
01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.550 line:82%
Sir.

1086
01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:32.060 line:82%
That's okay. But this one,
this is what I don't like.

1087
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.710 line:82%
-Redo it.
-I'll do that.

1088
01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.300 line:82%
The colour scheme is okay. Okay.

1089
01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.890 line:82%
But look at this one,
here, this one

1090
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.920 line:82%
Rahul, you said that
girl would come at 1:00pm.

1091
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.420 line:82%
It's already 4:00pm.
I don't think she'll come.

1092
01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.840 line:82%
So what should I do?

1093
01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.800 line:82%
If she doesn't come,
won't we do our play?

1094
01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.050 line:82%
-I was only
-Go and get on with your own thing.

1095
01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:52.000 line:82%
-Go.
-Okay, relax.

1096
01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.630 line:82%
-What happened?
-Please, don't disturb me.

1097
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:03.960 line:82%
Quiet, quiet everybody.

1098
01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:09.750 line:82%
Ballu, spotlight on the entrance.

1099
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.750 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

1100
01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:36.170 line:82%
Rahul. You must've heard of me?

1101
01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.170 line:82%
Cut it. No, no.

1102
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:01.380 line:82%
No, Pooja. No.

1103
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:03.420 line:82%
No, Pooja.

1104
01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.500 line:82%
You're not putting
your heart into it.

1105
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:10.050 line:82%
You are concentrating
more on the steps and music.

1106
01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:14.840 line:82%
I don't want to see
how well you dance.

1107
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.000 line:82%
I have already seen that,
and you are very good.

1108
01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:21.210 line:82%
I want to see whether
you are Maya or not.

1109
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:25.800 line:82%
I want to see the zenith
of Maya's love and passion.

1110
01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:31.170 line:82%
I want to see what happens
when Maya pours her heart out.

1111
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:33.170 line:82%
Right?

1112
01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:36.000 line:82%
Okay. We'll try it once more.

1113
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.420 line:82%
All right, music.

1114
01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.050 line:82%
Cut it!

1115
01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:59.130 line:82%
Why don't you understand?

1116
01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.380 line:82%
Forget anyone sitting here.

1117
01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:02.840 line:82%
Forget the music.

1118
01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.590 line:82%
Forget that this is a rehearsal.
Just think of Maya.

1119
01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:07.130 line:82%
God knows where you're lost.

1120
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:10.000 line:82%
I've cried myself hoarse that
I don't want to see your dance.

1121
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:12.630 line:82%
I don't want to see you dance.
I want to see your madness!

1122
01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:14.670 line:82%
Maya's madness

1123
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.670 line:82%
-I'm sorry, Pooja.
-Don't touch me.

1124
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.000 line:82%
I'm really sorry, Pooja.
I was just

1125
01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:27.380 line:82%
Never in my life has anyone
yelled at me like that.

1126
01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.130 line:82%
I know, Pooja. I'm an idiot.

1127
01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:32.250 line:82%
I don't know how to talk to girls.

1128
01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.630 line:82%
I told you I can't do it.

1129
01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:36.590 line:82%
But you're doing it really well.

1130
01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.550 line:82%
It's just that I'm
going on about Maya.

1131
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:40.630 line:82%
-I don't understand this Maya.
-Never mind

1132
01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:43.380 line:82%
-I don't want to do this. -Don't
worry if you don't understand.

1133
01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.960 line:82%
We don't have to do this today.
We can do it tomorrow. Okay?

1134
01:24:47.050 --> 01:24:50.170 line:82%
-I don't want to do it tomorrow
either. I'm not doing this. -Okay.

1135
01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:52.880 line:82%
-Maya, relax.
-My name is Pooja.

1136
01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:55.090 line:82%
Of course, it's Pooja.

1137
01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:59.130 line:82%
I'm sorry.
Sit down, please. Sit.

1138
01:24:59.210 --> 01:25:02.460 line:82%
I'm really sorry, Pooja.
Don't dance if you don't want to

1139
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:04.380 line:82%
but please stop crying.

1140
01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:05.550 line:82%
No water? Fine.

1141
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:08.800 line:82%
You see Pooja, it's a habit
with me to yell during rehearsals.

1142
01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.050 line:82%
I wasn't having a go at you.

1143
01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.090 line:82%
I was only trying to explain
to you about Maya that's all.

1144
01:25:17.130 --> 01:25:21.170 line:82%
Pooja, maybe you just
don't understand Maya.

1145
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.500 line:82%
Maya is the kind of girl

1146
01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:30.840 line:82%
who lives in a dream world.

1147
01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:36.420 line:82%
She believes that one day
her dream prince will come

1148
01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.090 line:82%
and carry her away.

1149
01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.880 line:82%
Her friends have always
made fun of her

1150
01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.880 line:82%
but that did not
shake her belief.

1151
01:25:46.670 --> 01:25:52.090 line:82%
And today, she has met
the man of her dreams

1152
01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:54.210 line:82%
and she's dancing.

1153
01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.210 line:82%
There is love in her dance.

1154
01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.380 line:82%
There's mad passion
and arrogance.

1155
01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:07.960 line:82%
As if to say,
I knew he would come

1156
01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:14.960 line:82%
and see he has come now.
My dream man has come.

1157
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:44.380 line:82%
Music.

1158
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:23.880 line:82%
-Wow, wonderful. -Brilliant.
-Brilliant. -Thank you.

1159
01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.500 line:82%
It was nice.

1160
01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.220 line:82%
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

1161
01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:39.260 line:82%
Nisha, I can't believe we got
such a good girl so quickly!

1162
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:42.800 line:82%
Had I not got the
right girl for this role

1163
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:44.640 line:82%
I'd have cancelled the play.

1164
01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.260 line:82%
I would've given the money back
and faced the music.

1165
01:27:47.850 --> 01:27:50.180 line:82%
But I was destined to meet Pooja.

1166
01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.220 line:82%
-Her name is Pooja!
-No, it's Jeetendra.

1167
01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.640 line:82%
Of course it's Pooja.

1168
01:27:57.970 --> 01:28:01.140 line:82%
-Is she beautiful?
-Really beautiful.

1169
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:04.930 line:82%
Remember how I described Maya?
She's just like her.

1170
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:10.260 line:82%
That innocent face, those
dreamy eyes and that bashfulness.

1171
01:28:11.890 --> 01:28:14.300 line:82%
She is too good, Nisha.
She's brilliant.

1172
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:15.470 line:82%
Yes.

1173
01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.100 line:82%
Is she a good dancer?

1174
01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.970 line:82%
When she dances, you
can't take your eyes off her.

1175
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:23.680 line:82%
I know that you will go
crazy when you see her.

1176
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.890 line:82%
-I see.
-Yes.

1177
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:27.720 line:82%
But can she act?

1178
01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:31.680 line:82%
Of course, she can. If she
can't act, what am I there for?

1179
01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.390 line:82%
If I can get you to act
I can get anyone to act.

1180
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:36.720 line:82%
Very funny.

1181
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.430 line:82%
There's no water, no soft drink
and you've called me for dinner.

1182
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:42.850 line:82%
Wait a minute and I'll
get something to drink.

1183
01:28:45.930 --> 01:28:47.050 line:82%
Rahul.

1184
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.760 line:82%
Is she as good a dancer as me?

1185
01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:55.010 line:82%
Are you crazy?
There's no dancer as good as you.

1186
01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:57.100 line:82%
-Right.
-Right.

1187
01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.680 line:82%
Idiot.

1188
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.430 line:82%
You can't even lie properly.

1189
01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.140 line:82%
There go your pants.

1190
01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.930 line:82%
The stitches gave away.

1191
01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:06.100 line:82%
-Hey Shruti, get my bag.
-Relax.

1192
01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:11.100 line:82%
-Let's go! -Okay, we'll push
off now. See you tomorrow.

1193
01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:13.300 line:82%
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

1194
01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:28.680 line:82%
-May I say something, Pooja?
-What?

1195
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:33.260 line:82%
-When you smile
-I know that I look good.

1196
01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.890 line:82%
Then?

1197
01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:39.180 line:82%
When you laugh, it rains.

1198
01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:41.800 line:82%
Give it back.

1199
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:52.470 line:82%
With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant.

1200
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:56.760 line:82%
Oh, king of the rains,
where do you come from?

1201
01:31:57.350 --> 01:32:01.140 line:82%
With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant.

1202
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.510 line:82%
Oh, king of the rains,
where do you come from?

1203
01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:32.390 line:82%
I know a girl and when she smiles

1204
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:41.055 line:82%
I know a girl and when she smiles,

1205
01:32:41.486 --> 01:32:45.140 line:82%
the rains come pouring down.

1206
01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:49.565 line:82%
I know a girl and when she smiles,

1207
01:32:49.956 --> 01:32:53.850 line:82%
the rains come pouring down.

1208
01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.050 line:82%
I know a boy and when he sings

1209
01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:07.285 line:82%
I know a boy and when he sings,

1210
01:33:07.566 --> 01:33:11.430 line:82%
the rain clouds mask the sky.

1211
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:15.970 line:82%
I know a boy and when he sings,

1212
01:33:16.221 --> 01:33:20.260 line:82%
the rain clouds mask the sky.

1213
01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:56.050 line:82%
The clouds have descended.

1214
01:33:56.390 --> 01:34:00.510 line:82%
They stand in our path.

1215
01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:05.010 line:82%
Tell us what your
intentions are, oh clouds!

1216
01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.890 line:82%
Won't you let us go home?

1217
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:13.510 line:82%
There's rain ahead,
a storm behind.

1218
01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:17.550 line:82%
The weather is treacherous.
Oh, where can we go?

1219
01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.660 line:82%
I know a girl and when she smiles,

1220
01:34:26.851 --> 01:34:30.680 line:82%
the rains come pouring down.

1221
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:35.430 line:82%
I know a boy and when he sings,

1222
01:34:35.681 --> 01:34:39.470 line:82%
the rain clouds mask the sky.

1223
01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:23.970 line:82%
The heavy sky stoops low
with clouds.

1224
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:28.140 line:82%
Everything has come
to a standstill.

1225
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:33.050 line:82%
How lovely is this season?

1226
01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:36.800 line:82%
Take the sign of the rains.

1227
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:41.220 line:82%
In such a weather,
say something

1228
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.510 line:82%
do something.
Why do you stand silent?

1229
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:56.600 line:82%
With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant.

1230
01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:00.970 line:82%
Oh king of the rains,
where do you come from?

1231
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.350 line:82%
With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant.

1232
01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:09.680 line:82%
Oh king of the rains,
where do you come from?

1233
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:40.930 line:82%
I know a girl and when she smiles,

1234
01:36:41.181 --> 01:36:44.970 line:82%
the rains come pouring down.

1235
01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.700 line:82%
I know a boy and when he sings,

1236
01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:53.760 line:82%
the rain clouds mask the sky.

1237
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:47.350 line:82%
The doctor has said clearly that
you can't go out of the house.

1238
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:50.390 line:82%
There's no need for you to
strain yourself trying to get up.

1239
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:52.930 line:82%
Now get into your bed and rest.

1240
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:56.850 line:82%
Who are you calling now?

1241
01:37:56.930 --> 01:38:00.640 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Oh yes, he called

1242
01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.550 line:82%
to say that he's at Soni's house.

1243
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.350 line:82%
At Soni's? Oh yes, Soni and
Jimmy are getting engaged today.

1244
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:10.850 line:82%
Aunt, get my clothes out quickly.
I want to go there. I'll just come.

1245
01:38:10.930 --> 01:38:13.390 line:82%
-Look, I'll call the doctor.
-Please Aunt!

1246
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:14.890 line:82%
She just won't listen.

1247
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:20.390 line:82%
The girl is beautiful.

1248
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:24.470 line:82%
The boy looks morose.

1249
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:26.970 line:82%
The two don't match.

1250
01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:34.850 line:82%
The two don't match.
They don't make a good pair

1251
01:38:34.930 --> 01:38:36.550 line:82%
I'll not give this to you.

1252
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:39.970 line:82%
I hate these weddings.

1253
01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.470 line:82%
I don't understand
why people get married.

1254
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:47.260 line:82%
If two people have decided to
spend their whole lives together

1255
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:49.300 line:82%
why are the others
making such a fuss?

1256
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:50.890 line:82%
Why are they all getting excited?

1257
01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:52.430 line:82%
These days it has become a fashion

1258
01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:55.510 line:82%
to have seven days
long wedding celebrations.

1259
01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:56.970 line:82%
Give me a break.

1260
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:59.890 line:82%
Get married, have a quiet ceremony,
and then go home and sleep.

1261
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:02.470 line:82%
I've even come to hate
the word 'marriage'.

1262
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:04.640 line:82%
Excuse me, may I have another one?

1263
01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:07.510 line:82%
But one good thing is that
in all this fuss

1264
01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.050 line:82%
you get lots of goodies to eat.

1265
01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.470 line:82%
Thank you. Have you eaten?

1266
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:12.010 line:82%
-Later.
-Let's sit.

1267
01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.930 line:82%
I really love weddings.

1268
01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:18.350 line:82%
The small rituals, dancing,
singing and making merry

1269
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:20.890 line:82%
-I love every bit of it.
-Very good.

1270
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:23.680 line:82%
I'm going to have all
of them at my wedding.

1271
01:39:24.850 --> 01:39:26.100 line:82%
Are you getting married?

1272
01:39:29.050 --> 01:39:30.180 line:82%
Yes.

1273
01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.390 line:82%
I mean, you never mentioned it.

1274
01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:39.430 line:82%
When are you going to do it?

1275
01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:42.100 line:82%
Actually, nothing is fixed yet.

1276
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.510 line:82%
He works abroad.

1277
01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.470 line:82%
When he comes back

1278
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:49.760 line:82%
we'll fix a date when
we've found an auspicious time.

1279
01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.640 line:82%
That's why I haven't
mentioned this to anyone.

1280
01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.640 line:82%
I see. Congratulations.

1281
01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.890 line:82%
Thanks.

1282
01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:05.260 line:82%
Rahul, when are you
getting married to Nisha?

1283
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:08.640 line:82%
Nisha and me? Are you crazy?

1284
01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:10.600 line:82%
The two of us are just good friends.

1285
01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.390 line:82%
There's no chance of us
getting married

1286
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:15.390 line:82%
and in any case no marriage
for me. Thank you.

1287
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:19.100 line:82%
Actually, I don't believe in the
institution of marriage at all.

1288
01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:20.850 line:82%
I don't know how two people decide

1289
01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:23.180 line:82%
to spend their whole
life with each other.

1290
01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:26.640 line:82%
I fail to understand
and I'm certain

1291
01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:31.050 line:82%
there can't be a girl who
could spend her whole life with me!

1292
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:34.260 line:82%
You're mistaken.
There is surely one such girl.

1293
01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:37.930 line:82%
-Where is she?
-Somewhere or the other.

1294
01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.760 line:82%
Rubbish.

1295
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:47.300 line:82%
I've always believed that God made
all relationships of the heart.

1296
01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:50.050 line:82%
But then He left it to
us to find each other.

1297
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.220 line:82%
He created all of us in pairs.

1298
01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.720 line:82%
For every one of us
there is a soul-mate.

1299
01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.760 line:82%
You just have to wait
till you meet her.

1300
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:03.600 line:82%
Do you think that's true?

1301
01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.850 line:82%
At least in my life,
that's the ultimate truth.

1302
01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.680 line:82%
True.

1303
01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:15.180 line:82%
That means that you've
found your soul mate.

1304
01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:18.640 line:82%
Yes. I've found him.

1305
01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.390 line:82%
I found my soul mate.

1306
01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:31.100 line:82%
-Something is amiss.
-What?

1307
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:35.350 line:82%
-The dessert is amazing. Have some.
-No.

1308
01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:36.970 line:82%
Okay.

1309
01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.260 line:82%
I don't know where he keeps it.

1310
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:47.180 line:82%
-Nisha! When were you discharged
from the hospital? -Hey, Ballu.

1311
01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:49.050 line:82%
-I ran away from hospital.
-Great.

1312
01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:51.050 line:82%
Jimmy and Soni will be
delighted to see you.

1313
01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:53.550 line:82%
-Where are they?
-Meet them at the lawn.

1314
01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.640 line:82%
-Rahul is there, isn't he?
-Rahul's gone to drop Pooja home.

1315
01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.680 line:82%
-Ballu.
-Coming. You go ahead.

1316
01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:03.800 line:82%
He has come and he has
come with a sword.

1317
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:04.970 line:82%
Pooja.

1318
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:12.640 line:82%
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

1319
01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:14.470 line:82%
-Pooja.
-What?

1320
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:19.220 line:82%
It's that story you
told me at Soni's.

1321
01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:22.930 line:82%
That some special girl
is made for me etc, etc

1322
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:24.850 line:82%
I've been thinking about that.

1323
01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:29.100 line:82%
-I don't get something.
-What?

1324
01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:34.640 line:82%
How would I know
who's made for me?

1325
01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:37.010 line:82%
You have so much faith
in this theory.

1326
01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.850 line:82%
I'm sure that you know about
how I'm going to meet this girl.

1327
01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:44.800 line:82%
I mean, will she be holding
a placard with my name on it?

1328
01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:47.180 line:82%
Or, when I see her would
there be a clap of thunder

1329
01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:48.800 line:82%
and a bolt of lightning?

1330
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:50.640 line:82%
Would music play?
What?

1331
01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:53.430 line:82%
He will tell you.

1332
01:42:53.970 --> 01:42:55.800 line:82%
He will give just one sign

1333
01:42:55.890 --> 01:42:58.640 line:82%
and your heart
would recognise the girl.

1334
01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:20.210 line:82%
I've tried reasoning with her
but she just wouldn't listen.

1335
01:47:20.630 --> 01:47:22.420 line:82%
-She does what she wants.
-Hi, Doctor.

1336
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.250 line:82%
-Doctor.
-Rahul, it is good that you came.

1337
01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:28.000 line:82%
-I'm fed up with this girl.
-Why? What happened?

1338
01:47:28.090 --> 01:47:32.420 line:82%
I told her clearly that she needs
to stay at home to rest.

1339
01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:36.000 line:82%
But look at her, she's packing
her bags to go somewhere.

1340
01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:38.670 line:82%
-Where to?
-How would I know?

1341
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:41.420 line:82%
I've tried my best to explain.
She doesn't listen to me.

1342
01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.750 line:82%
You're the only one
who could convince her.

1343
01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.130 line:82%
Don't worry as she won't
go anywhere.

1344
01:47:46.210 --> 01:47:47.550 line:82%
I'll go in, take her
to task now.

1345
01:47:47.630 --> 01:47:50.090 line:82%
-Okay? -Best of luck.
-Okay, see you. -Bye.

1346
01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.000 line:82%
Nisha.

1347
01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.670 line:82%
What are you doing, Nisha?
Are you nuts?

1348
01:47:58.750 --> 01:48:00.420 line:82%
The doctor told you to rest, right?

1349
01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.380 line:82%
By the way,
where are you off to?

1350
01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.750 line:82%
-I'm going to London.
-London?

1351
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.750 line:82%
Well, Mom and Dad keep calling me

1352
01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.920 line:82%
and it's been months
since I met them.

1353
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:12.130 line:82%
I thought I'd visit them.

1354
01:48:12.210 --> 01:48:15.130 line:82%
Besides, I want to
run away from here.

1355
01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:17.340 line:82%
Want to run away? From whom?

1356
01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:21.880 line:82%
-From myself.
-What's all this nonsense, Nisha?

1357
01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:25.300 line:82%
I've begun to get scared
of myself, Rahul.

1358
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.420 line:82%
I want to leave

1359
01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.550 line:82%
so I can avoid doing
what I did yesterday.

1360
01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:35.170 line:82%
Nisha, you haven't
done anything of the sort.

1361
01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:36.550 line:82%
You were just dancing.

1362
01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:38.300 line:82%
-Look here
-Rahul

1363
01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.250 line:82%
Now we should stop
evading the truth.

1364
01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:46.670 line:82%
We both know what the problem is.

1365
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:49.090 line:82%
What's the problem?

1366
01:48:51.670 --> 01:48:53.340 line:82%
The problem is that

1367
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.590 line:82%
I love you and
you don't love me.

1368
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:05.920 line:82%
-Look here, Nisha
-I know

1369
01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:11.300 line:82%
that you know
how much I love you.

1370
01:49:12.710 --> 01:49:14.880 line:82%
That night I wasn't sozzled

1371
01:49:15.670 --> 01:49:18.210 line:82%
to not hear what my heart
was saying.

1372
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:24.340 line:82%
Actually, Rahul, we've
become such good friends

1373
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:27.960 line:82%
that we take each other
for granted.

1374
01:49:29.170 --> 01:49:34.880 line:82%
So I think that a bit of space
will give us time to think.

1375
01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.840 line:82%
But I'm sure

1376
01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:44.210 line:82%
that when I'm not here,
you'll miss me a lot.

1377
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:47.550 line:82%
Then maybe then
you'd realise my worth.

1378
01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.000 line:82%
One thing is certain
that an idiot like you

1379
01:49:52.090 --> 01:49:54.500 line:82%
doesn't deserve a girl like me.

1380
01:49:55.630 --> 01:49:59.340 line:82%
And I don't know why,
but I feel that

1381
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.050 line:82%
when I come back

1382
01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:07.840 line:82%
you'll be on your knees
begging me to get married to you.

1383
01:50:08.630 --> 01:50:11.340 line:82%
And at that point of time,
I may not be in the mood for it.

1384
01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:13.550 line:82%
Get lost.

1385
01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:15.210 line:82%
Well, maybe you
haven't seen your face

1386
01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:16.500 line:82%
It's better than yours.

1387
01:50:17.670 --> 01:50:22.460 line:82%
-Hey, Nisha
-Rahul.

1388
01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:33.880 line:82%
Nisha, you're really nice.

1389
01:50:35.130 --> 01:50:36.750 line:82%
I know. Come now.

1390
01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.090 line:82%
I must meet everyone on
my way to the airport.

1391
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:40.800 line:82%
Come on, Rahul. Hurry up.

1392
01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.710 line:82%
-We'll see you.
-Bye, see you guys.

1393
01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:51.960 line:82%
-Take care.
-I'll really miss you. -Thanks.

1394
01:50:52.050 --> 01:50:54.460 line:82%
-Bye.
-Enjoy yourself.

1395
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:57.250 line:82%
-Take care.
-Bye Nisha. -Bye buddy.

1396
01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:58.960 line:82%
Rahul, has our stuff arrived?

1397
01:50:59.050 --> 01:51:01.550 line:82%
Ballu is mad.

1398
01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:07.340 line:82%
We haven't been
properly introduced.

1399
01:51:07.710 --> 01:51:09.960 line:82%
Let's start from the beginning.

1400
01:51:10.170 --> 01:51:12.420 line:82%
-Hi! I'm Nisha.
-I'm Pooja.

1401
01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:15.340 line:82%
Now that we are friends

1402
01:51:15.710 --> 01:51:20.210 line:82%
will you forgive me
for what I did yesterday?

1403
01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:22.670 line:82%
Forgive you? For what?

1404
01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:27.460 line:82%
Pooja, what I did with you
yesterday wasn't right.

1405
01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:31.500 line:82%
Actually, ever since
this place was built

1406
01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:34.550 line:82%
I've been the only one
who's danced on this floor.

1407
01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:37.550 line:82%
This floor has become my identity.

1408
01:51:38.050 --> 01:51:44.550 line:82%
So when I heard that someone else
had taken my place I felt bad.

1409
01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:48.710 line:82%
Without seeing you or
knowing you, I was jealous.

1410
01:51:49.710 --> 01:51:51.800 line:82%
I shouldn't have felt that way.

1411
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:55.170 line:82%
Had I been in your place,
I'd have done the same.

1412
01:51:55.710 --> 01:51:59.000 line:82%
Moreover, I really enjoyed
dancing with you.

1413
01:51:59.670 --> 01:52:01.550 line:82%
You were the one dancing.

1414
01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:03.960 line:82%
I was doing something else.

1415
01:52:05.630 --> 01:52:07.750 line:82%
-I'm really sorry, Pooja.
-It's okay

1416
01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.250 line:82%
Come on. The pilot
just called for you.

1417
01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:15.050 line:82%
I always told Rahul that there could
never be another dancer like me.

1418
01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:16.670 line:82%
But I can't say that any more.

1419
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:19.420 line:82%
And I'm sure that

1420
01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:22.460 line:82%
no one can play the role
of Maya better than you.

1421
01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:24.840 line:82%
Not even me. All the best.

1422
01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:26.300 line:82%
-Bye. See you.
-Thank you! Bye.

1423
01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:27.420 line:82%
Come.

1424
01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:31.170 line:82%
-Who is coming to drop me
to the airport? -Me!

1425
01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:26.250 line:82%
Hi. I'm Rahul.

1426
01:53:26.670 --> 01:53:28.170 line:82%
You must have heard of me?

1427
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.590 line:82%
I want a special dancer
for a special role.

1428
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:35.380 line:82%
I saw you dance yesterday and
felt you would be ideal for this.

1429
01:53:37.590 --> 01:53:39.500 line:82%
Check, check 69

1430
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:42.380 line:82%
Ballu, what are you doing?
Throw the spotlight properly.

1431
01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:47.090 line:82%
Pooja, good, good. But

1432
01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.750 line:82%
I think that you are not
opening up.

1433
01:53:52.170 --> 01:53:55.500 line:82%
I want to see how Maya
looks when she's happy.

1434
01:53:55.670 --> 01:53:59.920 line:82%
I want to see the zenith of
Maya's passion and love. Okay?

1435
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.170 line:82%
Do it again. Okay.

1436
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.750 line:82%
Quiet everybody.
Take it from the top.

1437
01:54:07.630 --> 01:54:08.750 line:82%
Music!

1438
01:54:09.670 --> 01:54:11.000 line:82%
Cut it! Cut it!

1439
01:54:11.210 --> 01:54:12.630 line:82%
I told you to forget
your identity

1440
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:14.710 line:82%
and forget that there
are people sitting here.

1441
01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:15.960 line:82%
Forget about the rehearsal.

1442
01:54:16.050 --> 01:54:17.340 line:82%
But you refuse to understand.

1443
01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:18.500 line:82%
Pack up.

1444
01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:23.340 line:82%
I don't get one thing, Pooja.

1445
01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:27.380 line:82%
How would I know which
girl was made for me?

1446
01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:30.340 line:82%
Will she be holding a placard
with my name on it?

1447
01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:32.630 line:82%
When I see her, would
there be a clap of thunder

1448
01:54:32.710 --> 01:54:34.250 line:82%
and a flash of lightning?

1449
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.960 line:82%
Oh dear, what's happening?
I really don't know.

1450
01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:33.710 line:82%
I only hope this does not
turn into a tale of love.

1451
01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:39.800 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?
Nobody really knows.

1452
01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:46.420 line:82%
But if this is a tale
of love, then so be it.

1453
01:57:35.090 --> 01:57:40.300 line:82%
Take my hand in yours
as long as you are here.

1454
01:57:41.590 --> 01:57:46.880 line:82%
Let's sit talking
as long as we can.

1455
01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:51.250 line:82%
Let's look into
each other's eyes

1456
01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:54.050 line:82%
as long as the night lasts.

1457
01:57:54.420 --> 01:58:00.750 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?
Nobody really knows.

1458
01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:12.500 line:82%
How do I describe
the state of my heart?

1459
01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:19.130 line:82%
Even the dewdrops seem to burn,
with the fever of my heart.

1460
01:58:20.250 --> 01:58:26.550 line:82%
Why do I feel as if
someone has caressed me

1461
01:58:26.630 --> 01:58:29.710 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?

1462
01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.750 line:82%
I don't really know.

1463
01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:39.000 line:82%
I only hope this does not
turn into a tale of love.

1464
01:58:39.590 --> 01:58:42.460 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?

1465
01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.840 line:82%
Nobody really knows.

1466
01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:48.840 line:82%
But if this is a tale of love

1467
01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:51.840 line:82%
then so be it.

1468
01:59:21.590 --> 01:59:26.750 line:82%
Please move away for a while,
so I can collect my feelings

1469
01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:33.090 line:82%
and calm the violent
beating of my heart.

1470
01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:40.630 line:82%
Let's slow down so that we
don't move ahead of time.

1471
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:46.960 line:82%
Oh dear, what's happening?
Nobody really knows.

1472
01:59:53.670 --> 01:59:58.840 line:82%
There is something between us.
So don't deny it.

1473
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:05.460 line:82%
And no one knows
how far it would go.

1474
02:00:06.590 --> 02:00:12.750 line:82%
For you should know that your
heart is not what it was.

1475
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.050 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?

1476
02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:19.340 line:82%
I don't really know.

1477
02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.300 line:82%
I only hope

1478
02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:25.710 line:82%
this does not turn
into a tale of love.

1479
02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:28.670 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?

1480
02:00:29.050 --> 02:00:31.710 line:82%
I don't really know.

1481
02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:35.300 line:82%
I only hope this does not

1482
02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:38.000 line:82%
turn into a tale of love.

1483
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000 line:82%
I hope your uncle would be asleep
and I won't have to hear him sing.

1484
02:01:14.130 --> 02:01:15.250 line:82%
-Bye.
-Bye

1485
02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.500 line:82%
-Rahul, I forgot to tell you.
-What?

1486
02:01:20.590 --> 02:01:23.300 line:82%
-I can't attend rehearsal tomorrow.
-Why?

1487
02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:26.130 line:82%
-Tomorrow I'm going to Khandala.
-Khandala? Why?

1488
02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:29.050 line:82%
-My sister lives there.
-Which sister?

1489
02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:31.090 line:82%
She's my dance teacher.

1490
02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:34.460 line:82%
She taught me everything I know.

1491
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:36.170 line:82%
It's her birthday tomorrow.

1492
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.710 line:82%
If I say no, will you not go?

1493
02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:46.210 line:82%
I'd go anyway, but if you
said yes, I'd go happily.

1494
02:01:48.170 --> 02:01:51.130 line:82%
I'm joking. Go on. I'll look
into the other jobs tomorrow.

1495
02:01:51.210 --> 02:01:53.630 line:82%
-Thanks. Bye.
-Bye.

1496
02:01:59.130 --> 02:02:00.550 line:82%
Rahul is finished.

1497
02:02:15.710 --> 02:02:17.840 line:82%
-Rahul? What are you doing here?
-Hi.

1498
02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:21.170 line:82%
I have a friend in Khandala.
He's been calling me for ages

1499
02:02:21.250 --> 02:02:22.630 line:82%
but I've never had
a chance to go.

1500
02:02:22.710 --> 02:02:25.170 line:82%
And since we can't work
without you

1501
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:27.250 line:82%
I thought I'd meet him,
and give you a ride too.

1502
02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:30.550 line:82%
As it is you're going alone,
so I thought you'd have company.

1503
02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:31.920 line:82%
Don't stare. Hurry up.

1504
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.130 line:82%
If we go early we'll beat
the traffic. Come on.

1505
02:02:35.170 --> 02:02:38.210 line:82%
Well, why are you smiling?

1506
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:40.130 line:82%
Nothing. Let's go.

1507
02:02:40.210 --> 02:02:42.710 line:82%
Today I'm really missing
my friend. Really!

1508
02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:04.090 line:82%
-Tommy, Ceasar, quiet! Quiet!
-Pooja, I'm scared of dogs.

1509
02:03:04.170 --> 02:03:06.840 line:82%
-Pooja, Get them off me.
-They won't do anything.

1510
02:03:07.130 --> 02:03:10.460 line:82%
Sister's taking a dance class there.
I'll just go and surprise her.

1511
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:12.630 line:82%
Stay here. Don't worry,
they won't bite you.

1512
02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:14.250 line:82%
-I'll be back.
-Tommy, please.

1513
02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:17.460 line:82%
Want some soft drink?
You can have these flowers too.

1514
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:32.800 line:82%
Sandhya, what are you doing?
I'll give you one now.

1515
02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:35.800 line:82%
You've put on so much weight,
and you can hardly move.

1516
02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:40.130 line:82%
No more chocolates and ice creams
for you. Get it right this time.

1517
02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:45.590 line:82%
Move the neck. Arms straight.

1518
02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:49.590 line:82%
You Why are you laughing?
Shut your mouth.

1519
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.420 line:82%
If anyone gets it wrong then
no one will watch TV tonight.

1520
02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:55.880 line:82%
Don't come begging to me again
saying, please sister.

1521
02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:58.210 line:82%
Please Sister, let me watch TV.

1522
02:03:58.670 --> 02:04:01.130 line:82%
Look. There comes your dear Pooja.

1523
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:03.670 line:82%
Sister, how did you recognize me?

1524
02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:05.800 line:82%
There's no need to act smart.

1525
02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:08.550 line:82%
I know all my girls from
the sound of their footsteps.

1526
02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:10.960 line:82%
Happy Birthday to you!

1527
02:04:11.050 --> 02:04:13.960 line:82%
What's this? You've brought me
another ugly saree.

1528
02:04:14.050 --> 02:04:16.590 line:82%
Yes, I chose the ugliest
I could get my hands on.

1529
02:04:18.090 --> 02:04:20.590 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Go on, class is over.

1530
02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:25.380 line:82%
Where you are going?
The class isn't over yet.

1531
02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.550 line:82%
Now I'm here and
the class is over.

1532
02:04:27.630 --> 02:04:29.170 line:82%
You're spoiling them very badly.

1533
02:04:29.250 --> 02:04:30.840 line:82%
They behave well all year round.

1534
02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.920 line:82%
The moment you step in,
they start misbehaving.

1535
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.500 line:82%
Sometimes one should be spoilt.

1536
02:04:34.590 --> 02:04:40.170 line:82%
-No! Sir Tommy, No!
-What happened?

1537
02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:44.800 line:82%
-Tommy, no!
-Don't let him go! Nab him!

1538
02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:47.550 line:82%
Sister! Wait!

1539
02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:49.500 line:82%
He's Rahul, my friend.

1540
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:50.960 line:82%
-Your friend?
-Yes!

1541
02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:53.420 line:82%
-Leave him, girls.
-Come on, leave him.

1542
02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:55.880 line:82%
-Tommy, Ceasar, go inside. Go.
-Tommy went?

1543
02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:58.420 line:82%
They're gone.
Why are you so frightened?

1544
02:04:59.090 --> 02:05:01.630 line:82%
Hi! Happy Birthday!

1545
02:05:03.250 --> 02:05:04.460 line:82%
-Ok.
-Where are your feet?

1546
02:05:05.250 --> 02:05:08.050 line:82%
-What are you up to?
-I'm trying to touch your feet.

1547
02:05:08.130 --> 02:05:11.920 line:82%
-Do I look that old?
-Not at all but out of respect.

1548
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.420 line:82%
-Give me your hand.
-Pardon me?

1549
02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:14.920 line:82%
-Your hand.
-Yes.

1550
02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:17.050 line:82%
Nice to meet you.

1551
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:21.380 line:82%
-Oh, you've caught a cold. Come,
let's go in. -Yes Pooja, please.

1552
02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:23.310 line:82%
-Save me from the dogs.
-They won't hurt you.

1553
02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:27.420 line:82%
-You don't know. They're very
dangerous. -Sister, who's he?

1554
02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:32.630 line:82%
I don't know but
I'll have to find out.

1555
02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:41.880 line:82%
Pooja, you didn't tell me
what Rahul does.

1556
02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:44.710 line:82%
Rahul? He directs plays.

1557
02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:48.170 line:82%
-These days, I'm working with him.
-I see.

1558
02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:53.710 line:82%
I think that you don't
like Rahul specially.

1559
02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:56.710 line:82%
No, I like him very much.

1560
02:05:57.300 --> 02:05:58.550 line:82%
Very much?

1561
02:05:58.630 --> 02:06:03.750 line:82%
No, I mean to say,
he's a good friend.

1562
02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:09.170 line:82%
Good friend?
You mean you don't love him.

1563
02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:14.670 line:82%
Sister, Rahul's just a friend.
A dear friend.

1564
02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:19.630 line:82%
I see a dear friend.

1565
02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:22.340 line:82%
It's not what you think

1566
02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:24.960 line:82%
and in any case,
I wanted to tell you something.

1567
02:06:25.050 --> 02:06:28.670 line:82%
There's no need to tell me.
I understand everything.

1568
02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:31.500 line:82%
Stop it, Sister.
Sister, you've got it all wrong.

1569
02:06:31.590 --> 02:06:35.170 line:82%
-Pooja.. Pooja..
-Rahul.. Rahul..

1570
02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:38.590 line:82%
-Pooja.
-Rahul, what's up? -Hi!

1571
02:06:38.670 --> 02:06:40.250 line:82%
-Hi!
-What's up?

1572
02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:43.250 line:82%
Nothing. Why are you standing
with the spoon? Come and join us.

1573
02:06:44.210 --> 02:06:46.630 line:82%
-Stupid!
-Hey everybody!

1574
02:06:48.460 --> 02:06:50.880 line:82%
Come on, everyone.
Follow me this way.

1575
02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:54.000 line:82%
Okay, come on.

1576
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:57.840 line:82%
If it's not love,
then what is it?

1577
02:06:59.210 --> 02:07:03.340 line:82%
-Sister honestly!
-Look here, girl!

1578
02:07:03.670 --> 02:07:06.710 line:82%
I've known you since you
were twelve years old.

1579
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.800 line:82%
What your heart doesn't
let you know, it tells me.

1580
02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:17.670 line:82%
The look in your eyes says
that you love this boy very much.

1581
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:22.090 line:82%
Now stop lying to me.
Understood? Okay?

1582
02:07:22.630 --> 02:07:24.050 line:82%
Just a dear friend.

1583
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.170 line:82%
Listen, Sister

1584
02:07:38.710 --> 02:07:44.840 line:82%
I can't recollect
when this happened.

1585
02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:51.090 line:82%
It's become difficult to hide
this secret from everyone.

1586
02:07:52.130 --> 02:07:58.750 line:82%
If you say so, today
I'll ask God for something.

1587
02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:04.710 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?
I don't really know.

1588
02:08:05.550 --> 02:08:11.670 line:82%
-What this leads to
-Let it become a romance.

1589
02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:39.750 line:82%
So when is Ajay coming back?

1590
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:42.990 line:82%
Nothing is definite, but
he could come at any time.

1591
02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:46.090 line:82%
-Say D.
-D.

1592
02:08:46.210 --> 02:08:48.870 line:82%
-Say O.
-O.

1593
02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.590 line:82%
-Say N.
-N.

1594
02:08:51.730 --> 02:08:52.920 line:82%
-Say K.
-K. -Yes.

1595
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.050 line:82%
-Now say E.
-E.

1596
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:57.960 line:82%
-Say Y.
-Y. -I'll be right back.

1597
02:08:58.090 --> 02:09:00.420 line:82%
Alright. Very good.

1598
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:01.670 line:82%
Let us start all over again.

1599
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:03.880 line:82%
-D.
-D.

1600
02:09:04.710 --> 02:09:06.800 line:82%
Okay, okay.

1601
02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:13.800 line:82%
-D. O. N.
-N.

1602
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:18.920 line:82%
-K.
-Pooja, give me your hand. -Why?

1603
02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.710 line:82%
I won't hit you!
Give me your hand.

1604
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:23.670 line:82%
Here it is.

1605
02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:26.050 line:82%
Here.

1606
02:09:26.170 --> 02:09:28.130 line:82%
-What's this?
-Hush.

1607
02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:32.890 line:82%
Listen carefully to what
I'm going to tell you.

1608
02:09:33.930 --> 02:09:36.050 line:82%
Ever since you were a child

1609
02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:40.970 line:82%
you've always put
others before yourself.

1610
02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:45.760 line:82%
I've always been overwhelmed
by your behavior.

1611
02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:51.180 line:82%
But today this same
behaviour has made me sad.

1612
02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:54.010 line:82%
-But I
-Quiet!

1613
02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:58.300 line:82%
Sometimes, it's very important
to think about yourself, Pooja.

1614
02:09:59.850 --> 02:10:04.300 line:82%
I see that you are running
away from your dreams.

1615
02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.640 line:82%
You won't let them come true.

1616
02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:09.970 line:82%
Don't do this, Pooja.

1617
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:16.550 line:82%
Not everybody is fortunate to
have their dreams materialised.

1618
02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:18.720 line:82%
Don't do this.

1619
02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:24.930 line:82%
Let me tell you something.
One can fall in love many times.

1620
02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:29.510 line:82%
True love only happens once.

1621
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:35.600 line:82%
Lord Ganpati will help you to

1622
02:10:36.850 --> 02:10:41.510 line:82%
take the step
you're unable to take.

1623
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:44.300 line:82%
He'll show you the right path.

1624
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:48.470 line:82%
He'll give you the strength
to fulfill your dreams.

1625
02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:52.760 line:82%
Keep Him with you always.

1626
02:10:53.550 --> 02:10:55.300 line:82%
I have faith in Him.

1627
02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:58.260 line:82%
The Lord will set
everything right.

1628
02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:00.680 line:82%
I love you, Sister.

1629
02:11:03.550 --> 02:11:05.680 line:82%
Stop it!

1630
02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:09.850 line:82%
I don't want to develop
the habit of crying.

1631
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:13.100 line:82%
Pooja!

1632
02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:16.930 line:82%
No.

1633
02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:18.720 line:82%
No way.

1634
02:11:19.050 --> 02:11:21.600 line:82%
You are very fat. Sister would
scold me if I gave this to you.

1635
02:11:23.550 --> 02:11:26.220 line:82%
-Why are you frightened?
-Pardon me?

1636
02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:29.050 line:82%
Why are you frightened of
being in love? Tell her.

1637
02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:30.760 line:82%
Love and me? I was just

1638
02:11:30.850 --> 02:11:32.260 line:82%
Okay, give me your hand.

1639
02:11:32.550 --> 02:11:33.800 line:82%
Give me your hand.

1640
02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:35.850 line:82%
Nice to meet you.

1641
02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:38.760 line:82%
Take it!

1642
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:41.760 line:82%
-What's this?
-This is in a way, my blessing.

1643
02:11:41.850 --> 02:11:43.640 line:82%
I'm very stingy in such matters.

1644
02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:46.430 line:82%
I don't give my blessing
that easily.

1645
02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:51.140 line:82%
But when I saw you I thought
you needed it.

1646
02:11:51.930 --> 02:11:55.850 line:82%
This will help you to say
what you're unable to say.

1647
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:58.600 line:82%
Keep it very carefully.

1648
02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:01.850 line:82%
-You get it?
-Got it.

1649
02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:04.600 line:82%
-Bye.
-Bye. -She's on her way.

1650
02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:07.640 line:82%
-If you can't say it, then
I'll say it. -I'll say it.

1651
02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:09.760 line:82%
-Definitely?
-Definitely.

1652
02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:12.640 line:82%
-Okay.
-Okay.

1653
02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:19.510 line:82%
Mark my words carefully.

1654
02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:29.800 line:82%
-Bye!
-Bye.

1655
02:12:29.890 --> 02:12:32.800 line:82%
-Bye!
-Good bye, Sister!

1656
02:12:32.890 --> 02:12:34.970 line:82%
-Bye!
-Bye, Sister!

1657
02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:36.800 line:82%
Okay!

1658
02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:40.220 line:82%
Okay!

1659
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:44.510 line:82%
First, the bride. You can drink
straight from the bottle.

1660
02:12:47.930 --> 02:12:50.850 line:82%
Okay. Here's to Soni and Jimmy.
Everyone together.

1661
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:52.930 line:82%
Cheers for the most beautiful
couple I've seen.

1662
02:12:53.010 --> 02:12:54.260 line:82%
Time for a speech.

1663
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:55.430 line:82%
Excuse me.

1664
02:12:55.510 --> 02:13:00.800 line:82%
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention, please?

1665
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:03.470 line:82%
Aunty, please thank you.

1666
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:08.890 line:82%
Since I am Jimmy's best man

1667
02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:12.890 line:82%
it's my good fortune
to make a speech

1668
02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:18.100 line:82%
and it's your misfortune
that you all have to listen to it.

1669
02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:23.550 line:82%
Till today, I didn't understand
how two people can take a vow

1670
02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:25.760 line:82%
to spend their entire
lives with each other.

1671
02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:30.140 line:82%
I didn't believe in
these vows of marriage.

1672
02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:33.390 line:82%
And seeing Jimmy
and Soni together

1673
02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:36.140 line:82%
only strengthened
my conviction.

1674
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:40.100 line:82%
Because there can't be anyone
as innocent as Soni

1675
02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:43.100 line:82%
and there can't be a scamp
to beat Jimmy.

1676
02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:47.850 line:82%
I used to worry that Soni
and Jimmy are too different

1677
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:50.970 line:82%
to spend their lives together.

1678
02:13:52.890 --> 02:13:57.890 line:82%
But today, I realise
that I was wrong.

1679
02:13:59.550 --> 02:14:01.930 line:82%
I'm a little ashamed to admit

1680
02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:05.640 line:82%
that I have started
believing in love.

1681
02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:10.930 line:82%
The kind of love in
which lips don't speak

1682
02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:13.850 line:82%
but eyes do.

1683
02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.470 line:82%
The kind of love that binds
two people together forever.

1684
02:14:22.850 --> 02:14:25.930 line:82%
And today, I keep thinking
of just one thing.

1685
02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:28.600 line:82%
I remember something

1686
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:32.970 line:82%
a very dear friend told me

1687
02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:35.890 line:82%
about God.

1688
02:14:36.550 --> 02:14:40.600 line:82%
God has already brought
hearts together

1689
02:14:40.970 --> 02:14:43.220 line:82%
but then He left the hearts
to find each other.

1690
02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:45.800 line:82%
He made us all in pairs.

1691
02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:50.390 line:82%
For every one of us, somewhere,
there's one soul mate just for us.

1692
02:14:50.970 --> 02:14:53.800 line:82%
He made Soni for Jimmy.

1693
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:56.300 line:82%
Today, I thank that God

1694
02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.390 line:82%
for bringing Jimmy
and Soni together.

1695
02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:04.470 line:82%
And I pray that

1696
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:11.470 line:82%
He may give each one of us the
ability to recognize our soul mate.

1697
02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:19.680 line:82%
Thank you.

1698
02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:20.890 line:82%
Thank you.

1699
02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:15.440 line:82%
My bangle?

1700
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:21.350 line:82%
Rahul, have you seen my bangle?

1701
02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:25.690 line:82%
Darn! Now I'm sure
that I won't find it.

1702
02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:29.520 line:82%
-It was my favourite bangle.
-Mine, too.

1703
02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:34.650 line:82%
Rahul!

1704
02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:37.440 line:82%
Come on, give it to me.

1705
02:16:38.850 --> 02:16:40.400 line:82%
Come here and take it.

1706
02:16:40.770 --> 02:16:42.060 line:82%
What childish behavior!

1707
02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:44.940 line:82%
Give it to me!

1708
02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:46.730 line:82%
Come closer.

1709
02:16:48.810 --> 02:16:50.150 line:82%
Here goes happy?

1710
02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:51.980 line:82%
Come closer.

1711
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:54.730 line:82%
-Rahul!
-Closer

1712
02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:56.230 line:82%
Stop it!

1713
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:57.770 line:82%
Closer

1714
02:17:17.310 --> 02:17:18.440 line:82%
Closer

1715
02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:23.480 line:82%
Closer

1716
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:28.350 line:82%
Closer

1717
02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:33.480 line:82%
Closer

1718
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:38.850 line:82%
Closer

1719
02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:43.650 line:82%
Closer

1720
02:18:57.650 --> 02:19:01.850 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something.

1721
02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:07.520 line:82%
You say something, and I'll
say something, my love.

1722
02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:17.400 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something.

1723
02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:22.480 line:82%
You say something, and I'll
say something, my love.

1724
02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:27.600 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something.

1725
02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:33.600 line:82%
You say something, and I'll
say something, my love.

1726
02:19:33.730 --> 02:19:38.400 line:82%
We'd have rather died
than reveal our secret.

1727
02:19:38.770 --> 02:19:41.310 line:82%
Oh, my love.

1728
02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.850 line:82%
Oh, my love.

1729
02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:48.190 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something.

1730
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:54.400 line:82%
You say something, and I'll
say something, my love.

1731
02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:40.900 line:82%
You were a few steps away from me.
I, a few steps away from you.

1732
02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:51.190 line:82%
You were a few steps away from me.
I, a few steps away from you.

1733
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:56.270 line:82%
Yet we might have been
hundreds of miles apart

1734
02:20:56.350 --> 02:21:00.980 line:82%
Step by step our wavering
hearts came together.

1735
02:21:01.310 --> 02:21:03.900 line:82%
Oh, my love.

1736
02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:06.480 line:82%
Oh, my love.

1737
02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:10.690 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something.

1738
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:16.100 line:82%
You say something,
I'll say something, my love.

1739
02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:20.980 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something.

1740
02:21:22.060 --> 02:21:27.270 line:82%
You say something,
I'll say something, my love.

1741
02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:13.900 line:82%
Come, you have won me over
and I am defeated by my heart.

1742
02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:23.980 line:82%
Come, you have won me over
and I am defeated by my heart.

1743
02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:28.940 line:82%
Today, with great difficulty
my lips say "love".

1744
02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:31.810 line:82%
Now I'm wildly in love.

1745
02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:33.940 line:82%
Don't ever leave me

1746
02:22:34.350 --> 02:22:39.020 line:82%
Don't ever leave me, my love.

1747
02:22:39.350 --> 02:22:43.650 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something

1748
02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:49.020 line:82%
You say something,
I'll say something, my love.

1749
02:22:49.770 --> 02:22:53.770 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something.

1750
02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:59.440 line:82%
You say something, and I'll
say something, my love.

1751
02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:04.520 line:82%
We would have rather died
than reveal our secret.

1752
02:23:05.060 --> 02:23:07.560 line:82%
Oh, my love.

1753
02:23:07.810 --> 02:23:10.230 line:82%
Oh, my love.

1754
02:23:10.350 --> 02:23:14.400 line:82%
How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something.

1755
02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:20.400 line:82%
You say something, and I'll
say something, my love.

1756
02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:15.270 line:82%
Careful. Hey, Suppandi, watch
the scenery. Jimmy, watch Soni.

1757
02:24:15.350 --> 02:24:18.650 line:82%
What's up, Supandi? Tell me.

1758
02:24:18.730 --> 02:24:20.400 line:82%
-Oh.
-I'm coming. I'm coming.

1759
02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.060 line:82%
Just do this for me.

1760
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:25.810 line:82%
-Tell me how much do I work?
-Keep this on top.

1761
02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:28.440 line:82%
-Take it. -Where's Pooja?
She's nowhere to be seen.

1762
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:52.270 line:82%
Rahul!

1763
02:24:53.770 --> 02:24:54.850 line:82%
The set is ready.

1764
02:24:56.190 --> 02:24:57.560 line:82%
Good, well done.

1765
02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:00.100 line:82%
-Call Pooja.
-Okay.

1766
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:01.940 line:82%
-Shruti. Call Pooja.
-Yes!

1767
02:25:09.350 --> 02:25:11.060 line:82%
Pooja, we're ready.

1768
02:25:14.650 --> 02:25:17.230 line:82%
-Are you angry with me?
-Not at all.

1769
02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:21.730 line:82%
Then why are you not
speaking to me?

1770
02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:23.060 line:82%
I am speaking to you.

1771
02:25:24.810 --> 02:25:28.980 line:82%
For three days, I haven't seen
your face or heard your voice.

1772
02:25:29.850 --> 02:25:31.900 line:82%
I was very busy.

1773
02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:34.100 line:82%
I have been calling you everyday.

1774
02:25:34.270 --> 02:25:35.650 line:82%
Why haven't you been answering?

1775
02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:38.770 line:82%
The phone has been out
of order for some time.

1776
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:51.350 line:82%
What is the problem?

1777
02:25:53.730 --> 02:25:57.150 line:82%
Tell me. I want to know the
cause of your restlessness.

1778
02:25:58.310 --> 02:26:01.440 line:82%
-There's no problem.
-There is a problem.

1779
02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:03.770 line:82%
Serious problem.

1780
02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:10.480 line:82%
The fact is that we both
love each other very much.

1781
02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:15.100 line:82%
We can't tell each other
about it.

1782
02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:21.900 line:82%
Today, I've come here
to tell you

1783
02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:26.650 line:82%
that I love you.

1784
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:29.440 line:82%
I love you very much.

1785
02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:33.810 line:82%
And I know that
you also love me.

1786
02:26:33.980 --> 02:26:35.270 line:82%
So, say it once

1787
02:26:36.270 --> 02:26:40.270 line:82%
and that will be the
end of your restlessness.

1788
02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:42.850 line:82%
Everything will be all right.

1789
02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:48.350 line:82%
-I don't love you.
-You're lying.

1790
02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:51.480 line:82%
-I'm not lying.
-You aren't?

1791
02:26:52.650 --> 02:26:56.400 line:82%
Look into my eyes
and tell me

1792
02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:59.850 line:82%
that we are not made
for each other.

1793
02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:02.600 line:82%
We are not.

1794
02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:08.350 line:82%
Tell me that when I leave you,
you don't turn to look at me.

1795
02:27:09.690 --> 02:27:10.770 line:82%
I won't.

1796
02:27:11.730 --> 02:27:16.560 line:82%
Tell me that nothing happens
to you when I touch you.

1797
02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:21.060 line:82%
-Nothing.
-Tell me

1798
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:25.810 line:82%
that you don't want to
come into my arms right now.

1799
02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:29.520 line:82%
I don't.

1800
02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:31.900 line:82%
Look into my eyes just once

1801
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:35.730 line:82%
and tell me that
you don't love me.

1802
02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:41.650 line:82%
I don't

1803
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:48.400 line:82%
-For each other.
-I don't

1804
02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:52.400 line:82%
-For each other.
-I don't

1805
02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:53.560 line:82%
I don't

1806
02:27:55.350 --> 02:27:56.440 line:82%
I don't

1807
02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.980 line:82%
Terrific performance!
Very well done!

1808
02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:02.020 line:82%
Excellent!
Fabulous Rahul! Wonderful.

1809
02:28:02.100 --> 02:28:03.350 line:82%
-Fantastic.
-Thanks.

1810
02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:05.400 line:82%
Rahul, was my lighting fine?

1811
02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:07.600 line:82%
-Soni, I'd told you.
-Nisha!

1812
02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:12.150 line:82%
-Nisha? Let's go and give her
a warm welcome. -Welcome.

1813
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:15.100 line:82%
-Hi. -Hi!
Great to see you back again.

1814
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:16.400 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hi.

1815
02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:19.100 line:82%
-Oh, Raju, I'd told you
she'd come back soon. -Hi.

1816
02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:24.690 line:82%
'But I'm sure that
when I'm not here'

1817
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:27.020 line:82%
'you'll remember me often. '

1818
02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:31.230 line:82%
'I don't know why,
but when I get back'

1819
02:28:31.310 --> 02:28:36.060 line:82%
'you'll be on your knees
begging me to marry you.'

1820
02:28:36.150 --> 02:28:38.940 line:82%
'And then perhaps I may not
be in the mood for marrying.'

1821
02:28:42.690 --> 02:28:44.400 line:82%
Well, I'll be off.

1822
02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:47.730 line:82%
I'm a little tired.
I'll see you all tomorrow.

1823
02:28:47.810 --> 02:28:49.600 line:82%
-Okay. As you wish.
-Bye.

1824
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:54.190 line:82%
-What's up with Nisha? -She's
tired. She'll come tomorrow.

1825
02:28:54.270 --> 02:28:55.850 line:82%
Don't get unnecessarily worried.

1826
02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:26.730 line:82%
I'm not a nice girl, Rahul.

1827
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.300 line:82%
I'm bad.

1828
02:29:33.630 --> 02:29:34.960 line:82%
I'm really bad.

1829
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.800 line:82%
No Nisha, you're my friend.

1830
02:29:41.050 --> 02:29:44.210 line:82%
And no friend of mine is bad.

1831
02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:48.590 line:82%
No, Rahul, you don't know

1832
02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:51.590 line:82%
that I'm not a nice girl.

1833
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.170 line:82%
Now you see

1834
02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:59.840 line:82%
I love a boy

1835
02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:03.340 line:82%
and have always loved him.

1836
02:30:05.170 --> 02:30:09.380 line:82%
Today I realised that
he doesn't love me.

1837
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:12.340 line:82%
He loves someone else.

1838
02:30:14.210 --> 02:30:15.960 line:82%
I feel bad.

1839
02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:18.800 line:82%
I'm hurt.

1840
02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:22.710 line:82%
I'm upset. I feel jealous.

1841
02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:27.840 line:82%
Rahul, I shouldn't
feel like this.

1842
02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:30.750 line:82%
I'm bad.

1843
02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:33.170 line:82%
I'm very bad.

1844
02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:36.920 line:82%
-No, Nisha.
-No, Rahul.

1845
02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:43.670 line:82%
Actually, that boy
isn't just the one I love

1846
02:30:45.420 --> 02:30:47.630 line:82%
but he's also my best friend.

1847
02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:54.710 line:82%
Today, for the first time,
I saw love in his eyes.

1848
02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:59.550 line:82%
I couldn't bring that
love in all these years

1849
02:31:01.050 --> 02:31:03.130 line:82%
but that other girl has
brought it.

1850
02:31:05.090 --> 02:31:09.670 line:82%
Perhaps they are made
for each other.

1851
02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:14.000 line:82%
Perhaps I was never meant for him.

1852
02:31:16.170 --> 02:31:18.500 line:82%
Perhaps her love for him is true.

1853
02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:25.250 line:82%
So you see, I should
be happy for my friend.

1854
02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:28.710 line:82%
I should revel in his happiness.

1855
02:31:30.750 --> 02:31:35.340 line:82%
But I'm not happy I'm not!

1856
02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:38.170 line:82%
I'm very bad

1857
02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:40.420 line:82%
really very bad.

1858
02:31:41.170 --> 02:31:44.590 line:82%
Nisha, you're not bad.

1859
02:31:46.050 --> 02:31:47.300 line:82%
You're really nice.

1860
02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:51.130 line:82%
You know who is bad?

1861
02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:56.210 line:82%
He is bad.

1862
02:31:58.750 --> 02:32:01.840 line:82%
The One who plays around
with us mortals

1863
02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:06.710 line:82%
making A love B

1864
02:32:08.090 --> 02:32:09.710 line:82%
while B loves C

1865
02:32:11.170 --> 02:32:12.800 line:82%
and C loves D.

1866
02:32:14.840 --> 02:32:16.800 line:82%
I don't know why He does this.

1867
02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:21.300 line:82%
When He makes one
person love another

1868
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:25.500 line:82%
He ought to make sure that the
other one also loves her in return.

1869
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:28.710 line:82%
Right?

1870
02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:35.300 line:82%
But that's not what He does.

1871
02:32:37.380 --> 02:32:38.550 line:82%
He's really bad.

1872
02:32:40.050 --> 02:32:41.090 line:82%
He's really bad.

1873
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:43.670 line:82%
You're not bad.

1874
02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:48.130 line:82%
He's bad.

1875
02:32:49.050 --> 02:32:53.130 line:82%
You're right.
It's He who's bad.

1876
02:32:55.210 --> 02:32:56.550 line:82%
He's bad!

1877
02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:00.840 line:82%
You're bad. I'm not.

1878
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:04.460 line:82%
You're bad. I haven't
done anything wrong.

1879
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:07.250 line:82%
You are the one.

1880
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:09.880 line:82%
You are bad. You are bad.

1881
02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:12.960 line:82%
You are bad. You are bad.

1882
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:15.050 line:82%
I'm not bad.

1883
02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:17.920 line:82%
-I'm not bad.
-I'm sorry, Nisha.

1884
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:26.300 line:82%
Don't say sorry, Rahul.

1885
02:33:27.710 --> 02:33:28.920 line:82%
Else, I'll cry.

1886
02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:36.880 line:82%
-I'm sorry, Nisha.
-Don't say sorry, or I'll cry.

1887
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.130 line:82%
Sorry.

1888
02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:44.630 line:82%
No, Rahul, don't say sorry.

1889
02:33:45.050 --> 02:33:46.170 line:82%
I'll break down.

1890
02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:49.880 line:82%
Rahul!

1891
02:34:05.130 --> 02:34:06.250 line:82%
Ajay

1892
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:12.920 line:82%
when I was a little girl, you
used to tease me about my dreams.

1893
02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:20.250 line:82%
When I used to tell you that I am
looking for the one meant for me

1894
02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:25.380 line:82%
you would say that
I am crazy and silly.

1895
02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:30.630 line:82%
You'd say that when I grow up

1896
02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:33.710 line:82%
my dreams will vanish.

1897
02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:39.050 line:82%
But you know, I have grown up

1898
02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:42.500 line:82%
and my dreams have
not vanished.

1899
02:34:43.460 --> 02:34:47.210 line:82%
They have grown with me.

1900
02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:52.250 line:82%
That day, at the airport, when you
suddenly asked me to marry you

1901
02:34:53.170 --> 02:34:55.710 line:82%
at first I didn't realize
what I should do.

1902
02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:58.840 line:82%
Then I saw you going.

1903
02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:03.170 line:82%
But then I thought,
I was crazy

1904
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:06.460 line:82%
you were my dearest friend

1905
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:13.250 line:82%
and the one who
knew me the most.

1906
02:35:14.210 --> 02:35:15.960 line:82%
Who could be better for me?

1907
02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:20.800 line:82%
And I was standing
lost in my thoughts.

1908
02:35:23.170 --> 02:35:27.670 line:82%
You left and I was silly
to make you a part of my dreams.

1909
02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:32.960 line:82%
I started believing that
you were the one made for me.

1910
02:35:35.130 --> 02:35:36.210 line:82%
And then

1911
02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:40.750 line:82%
and then I met Rahul.

1912
02:35:41.250 --> 02:35:43.750 line:82%
You're marrying Pooja?

1913
02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:46.000 line:82%
What are you saying?

1914
02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:48.340 line:82%
But Pooja hasn't said
anything to me about it.

1915
02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:51.000 line:82%
I had forbidden
her from telling you.

1916
02:35:51.090 --> 02:35:53.380 line:82%
I wanted to tell you myself.

1917
02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:55.800 line:82%
Oh, God!
I can hardly believe you!

1918
02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:58.250 line:82%
I'm so happy!
When are you coming?

1919
02:35:58.340 --> 02:36:01.250 line:82%
I called just to tell you this.

1920
02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:03.340 line:82%
-I'm coming tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

1921
02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:05.550 line:82%
What can I tell you about Rahul?

1922
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:07.800 line:82%
Where do I begin?

1923
02:36:09.050 --> 02:36:14.590 line:82%
Well, you should realize that
I've never met anyone like him.

1924
02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:19.880 line:82%
Sometimes he's an angel,
sometimes a devil.

1925
02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:23.840 line:82%
Sometimes crazy
and sometimes a genius.

1926
02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:27.090 line:82%
Sometimes he scolds
so harshly

1927
02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:30.800 line:82%
and sometimes he makes
funny faces to make me laugh.

1928
02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:34.880 line:82%
At times he's more
stubborn than a child

1929
02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:38.170 line:82%
and at times he's
a beloved companion.

1930
02:36:38.250 --> 02:36:39.960 line:82%
In three days? Oh, no.

1931
02:36:40.050 --> 02:36:43.500 line:82%
I want time to get things
ready for a big wedding.

1932
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:44.960 line:82%
Mom, I don't have time.

1933
02:36:45.050 --> 02:36:47.840 line:82%
The company's sending
me to Japan for a year.

1934
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:50.590 line:82%
You'll have to wait for eight
to ten months. Think about it.

1935
02:36:50.670 --> 02:36:53.170 line:82%
I can't wait that long.

1936
02:36:53.250 --> 02:36:56.000 line:82%
All right, you come here and
I'll start the preparations.

1937
02:36:56.090 --> 02:36:58.340 line:82%
The dreams of your crazy
girl have come true, Ajay.

1938
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.090 line:82%
She's found the partner
of her dreams

1939
02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:06.880 line:82%
and she wants
to know whether

1940
02:37:08.250 --> 02:37:12.090 line:82%
she can make all
her dreams come true.

1941
02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:17.210 line:82%
Can she make her dreams
come true?

1942
02:37:44.250 --> 02:37:45.840 line:82%
Ajay phoned just now.

1943
02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:48.840 line:82%
He's told me everything.

1944
02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:51.550 line:82%
He's coming tomorrow, Pooja

1945
02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:55.210 line:82%
and he told me to get the wedding
organised as quickly as possible.

1946
02:37:56.420 --> 02:38:00.590 line:82%
You're a silly goose. You would
tell me your smallest secrets

1947
02:38:01.090 --> 02:38:03.340 line:82%
and you hid such
a big one from me?

1948
02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:05.880 line:82%
Come here.

1949
02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:10.630 line:82%
Sit by my side.

1950
02:38:18.050 --> 02:38:21.670 line:82%
You know, Pooja, ever since
you came to this house

1951
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:24.210 line:82%
I've had a dream in which

1952
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:26.920 line:82%
one day, you'd become
my daughter-in-law

1953
02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:32.130 line:82%
and I, your mother.

1954
02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:35.460 line:82%
But I was afraid

1955
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:38.250 line:82%
of how you two would
be when you grew up.

1956
02:38:38.670 --> 02:38:40.630 line:82%
Whether you would be friends..

1957
02:38:41.050 --> 02:38:43.130 line:82%
..or whether you'd take
a liking to each other.

1958
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:47.090 line:82%
Hence, I never revealed
my heart's desire.

1959
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:49.840 line:82%
I also wanted that

1960
02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.210 line:82%
you should decide,
if you really wanted it

1961
02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:53.920 line:82%
and not for my sake.

1962
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:59.550 line:82%
I wanted you to choose Ajay
willingly.

1963
02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:06.750 line:82%
You don't know how happy
I am, for I know

1964
02:39:07.300 --> 02:39:09.210 line:82%
that there cannot
be a better girl

1965
02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:13.050 line:82%
than you for my son.

1966
02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:18.840 line:82%
Just watch. I'm going to
give you a grand wedding.

1967
02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:24.960 line:82%
You have no idea
how happy I am.

1968
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:28.800 line:82%
May you live long!

1969
02:40:32.810 --> 02:40:34.520 line:82%
I want full lights
and I want to see

1970
02:40:34.650 --> 02:40:36.690 line:82%
M6 on both left
and right of stage.

1971
02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:39.440 line:82%
Suppandi, I want to hear
the music tracks in a while.

1972
02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:43.560 line:82%
Soni, the elevation
should be three feet higher

1973
02:40:43.650 --> 02:40:46.020 line:82%
or the audience on the right
won’t know what's going on.

1974
02:40:46.100 --> 02:40:47.940 line:82%
When Ballu lights M6,
a spotlight will filter here.

1975
02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:50.440 line:82%
The audience gets a glimpse
of the entry beforehand.

1976
02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:52.440 line:82%
-Rahul.
-Hi Pooja.

1977
02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:54.060 line:82%
Make sure this doesn't happen.

1978
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:55.560 line:82%
-I want them in complete.
-Rahul.

1979
02:40:55.650 --> 02:40:57.770 line:82%
-Sure. Sure.
-I'll take care of it. -Yes.

1980
02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:01.400 line:82%
I need to talk to you.

1981
02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:03.690 line:82%
The show opens in two days,
And we'll talk later.

1982
02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:06.730 line:82%
Shruti.. Soni, you just take
care of this. I'll see you.

1983
02:41:06.810 --> 02:41:07.900 line:82%
Hello.

1984
02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:11.520 line:82%
Show me all the costumes of
act three's dream sequence.

1985
02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:14.850 line:82%
-Always sitting with Soni. Never
does any work. -That's not so.

1986
02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.770 line:82%
-All are approved?
-This one is.

1987
02:41:16.850 --> 02:41:18.980 line:82%
-Yes.
-Trials done? -Yes. -Rahul.

1988
02:41:19.060 --> 02:41:21.350 line:82%
-Yes.
-Rahul, I have to talk to you.

1989
02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:23.520 line:82%
-Pooja, just a minute.
I'll just finish this. -But

1990
02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.350 line:82%
One minute. One minute.
Shruti. Shruti, pay attention here.

1991
02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:32.650 line:82%
Okay tell me
what's the problem? Shoot.

1992
02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:36.440 line:82%
Rahul, please try and understand
what I am about to tell you.

1993
02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:40.150 line:82%
-Rahul, Nisha's calling you. There's
a call from the auditorium. -Darn.

1994
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:41.350 line:82%
I forgot talking to her.
I'll be back.

1995
02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:42.560 line:82%
-Supandi, come.
-Rahul.

1996
02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:43.690 line:82%
Where's Nisha?

1997
02:41:47.690 --> 02:41:49.270 line:82%
Rahul, please be serious.

1998
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:51.310 line:82%
Ajay?

1999
02:41:51.650 --> 02:41:55.310 line:82%
My name is Ajay, but if you
wish you can call me Rahul.

2000
02:41:56.150 --> 02:42:01.440 line:82%
-Fatso! I love you!
-Nisha, you'd said

2001
02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:05.650 line:82%
I really missed you.

2002
02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:13.150 line:82%
Remember Pooja, I told you that
I'd come to get you anytime any day?

2003
02:42:13.230 --> 02:42:14.350 line:82%
Here I am.

2004
02:42:14.940 --> 02:42:18.310 line:82%
I came here after meeting mom.
She is so elated.

2005
02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:22.600 line:82%
Hey, I hope you haven't
changed your mind.

2006
02:42:22.850 --> 02:42:24.310 line:82%
You're marrying me, aren't you?

2007
02:42:25.270 --> 02:42:26.900 line:82%
Have you told your friends?

2008
02:42:26.980 --> 02:42:30.440 line:82%
-I was going to...
-Oh! I'll have to do that too?

2009
02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.190 line:82%
Come on. I'll tell them all
that we are getting married.

2010
02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:39.100 line:82%
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

2011
02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:42.770 line:82%
You don't know my name.
It's Ajay.

2012
02:42:44.350 --> 02:42:46.400 line:82%
I'm Pooja's childhood friend.

2013
02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:50.230 line:82%
And since she hasn't
found a worthy guy

2014
02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:53.480 line:82%
I took pity on her,
and I'm going to marry her.

2015
02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:56.480 line:82%
-Congratulations! -Alright,
okay. Thank you very much.

2016
02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:58.350 line:82%
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

2017
02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:02.650 line:82%
Thank you. Okay, okay.

2018
02:43:02.730 --> 02:43:04.060 line:82%
In three days, we'll be married.

2019
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:06.600 line:82%
and you all must come,
with family.

2020
02:43:06.730 --> 02:43:08.480 line:82%
-Okay. Definitely.
-We'll all come.

2021
02:43:15.060 --> 02:43:16.150 line:82%
Rahul!

2022
02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:26.020 line:82%
Pooja, you're weird.
Why didn't you tell us before?

2023
02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:29.520 line:82%
We had begun to feel
that you were our Maya.

2024
02:43:29.770 --> 02:43:33.560 line:82%
We forgot you're Pooja and
you have your own private life

2025
02:43:33.850 --> 02:43:37.730 line:82%
and your own relationships
and even prior commitments.

2026
02:43:37.810 --> 02:43:40.020 line:82%
We are really stupid!

2027
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:43.900 line:82%
Oh, I forgot
Pooja, congratulations.

2028
02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:46.560 line:82%
-Thanks.
-And this is

2029
02:43:47.810 --> 02:43:50.020 line:82%
This is Rahul, our director.

2030
02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:53.190 line:82%
Rahul, she likes your name a lot.

2031
02:43:53.270 --> 02:43:55.980 line:82%
-She likes only the name?
-I hope so, man!

2032
02:43:56.060 --> 02:43:57.440 line:82%
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

2033
02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:00.480 line:82%
-Rahul, I have a request.
-Go on.

2034
02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:03.440 line:82%
-May I take her away for an hour?
-Oh, come on!

2035
02:44:03.690 --> 02:44:06.310 line:82%
You're taking her
away forever from us.

2036
02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:09.940 line:82%
That will be in a ceremonious way.
What say, Pooja?

2037
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:14.150 line:82%
This is just a lunch date with Pooja.
Do I have your permission?

2038
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:15.940 line:82%
My permission!

2039
02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:19.060 line:82%
Now I'll have to get your
permission to meet Pooja.

2040
02:44:19.810 --> 02:44:21.690 line:82%
Besides, now that you've come

2041
02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:24.850 line:82%
Pooja won't be happy here.
Isn’t it, Pooja?

2042
02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:29.020 line:82%
So, go on.
I'll get by without you.

2043
02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:32.100 line:82%
-Are you sure?
-Yes, of course! Absolutely!

2044
02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:34.520 line:82%
You guys go and
have a good time. Go on.

2045
02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:37.810 line:82%
-We have his permission.
Let's go. -Go on.

2046
02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:39.730 line:82%
-Okay guys.
-Okay, see you.

2047
02:44:39.810 --> 02:44:43.650 line:82%
-Bye. After three days, okay?
-We'll be there.

2048
02:44:59.850 --> 02:45:02.770 line:82%
Ballu, show me the final mix.

2049
02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:07.270 line:82%
Shruti, show me the sketches.

2050
02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:14.150 line:82%
And Nisha, call up the
auditorium and tell them.

2051
02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:16.730 line:82%
The thing is that

2052
02:45:16.810 --> 02:45:19.150 line:82%
-in two days we're
going on stage. -Rahul!

2053
02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:40.340 line:82%
Lights! why aren't you
showing me the lights.

2054
02:45:40.750 --> 02:45:43.670 line:82%
There are just two days,
and you're taking it easy!

2055
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:45.250 line:82%
Come on, the lights.

2056
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.500 line:82%
Shruti, show me the sketches.

2057
02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:49.710 line:82%
Quickly bring the sketches
here, fast!

2058
02:45:50.210 --> 02:45:52.840 line:82%
Tania, hurry up with the band.

2059
02:45:53.050 --> 02:45:55.130 line:82%
We've got to finish
the music rehearsals, too!

2060
02:45:55.210 --> 02:45:56.300 line:82%
Come on, everybody.

2061
02:45:56.380 --> 02:45:58.380 line:82%
Faster everybody.
Come on.

2062
02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:04.050 line:82%
This is our last meeting.

2063
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:07.170 line:82%
I'm getting married tomorrow.

2064
02:46:08.710 --> 02:46:12.670 line:82%
I don't want to meet you
ever again after today.

2065
02:46:14.170 --> 02:46:17.800 line:82%
Just assume that I was never
a part of your life.

2066
02:46:31.050 --> 02:46:34.920 line:82%
As soon as I start to move,
track me with the spotlight

2067
02:46:36.170 --> 02:46:38.880 line:82%
and the other will stay
on Pooja.

2068
02:46:40.750 --> 02:46:42.960 line:82%
When I get right up
to the audience

2069
02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:46.340 line:82%
then slowly dim the light.

2070
02:46:48.250 --> 02:46:49.550 line:82%
The show will be over.

2071
02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:52.420 line:82%
The End.

2072
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:55.800 line:82%
That's it.

2073
02:46:56.300 --> 02:46:57.710 line:82%
Any questions?

2074
02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:00.880 line:82%
-I don't want any mistakes,
okay? -Okay!

2075
02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:02.500 line:82%
-Raj, is everything all right?
-Yes.

2076
02:47:02.590 --> 02:47:06.300 line:82%
Okay then, tomorrow be
at the stadium on time.

2077
02:47:06.750 --> 02:47:08.300 line:82%
-Pack up? Okay.
-I'll take that.

2078
02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:12.800 line:82%
-Hey, Rahul. Something
is bothering me. -What?

2079
02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:15.960 line:82%
-I don't like the end
of your story. -Why?

2080
02:47:16.750 --> 02:47:19.800 line:82%
This ending is too sad.

2081
02:47:20.590 --> 02:47:23.590 line:82%
A love story should always
have a happy ending.

2082
02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:26.920 line:82%
The audience should
come out smiling, right?

2083
02:47:28.420 --> 02:47:30.800 line:82%
People like to live
in a dream world.

2084
02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:33.800 line:82%
They have seen many dreams.

2085
02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:36.920 line:82%
Let them see a little
reality now.

2086
02:47:38.380 --> 02:47:41.340 line:82%
Every love story is like
this in real life.

2087
02:47:42.300 --> 02:47:46.800 line:82%
Full of sorrow and pain.

2088
02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:55.590 line:82%
No, Nisha. This ending
is absolutely right.

2089
02:47:57.210 --> 02:48:01.840 line:82%
There can't be another
end to this love story.

2090
02:49:03.340 --> 02:49:07.250 line:82%
I know a girl,
and when she smiles

2091
02:49:07.710 --> 02:49:11.500 line:82%
it rains.

2092
02:49:12.090 --> 02:49:15.960 line:82%
I know a boy,
and when he sings

2093
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:20.250 line:82%
it rains.

2094
02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:39.000 line:82%
-Jimmy, just go and check the
next entry stage left. -Okay.

2095
02:49:55.050 --> 02:49:58.800 line:82%
The heart is crazy,
and just refuses to listen.

2096
02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:33.420 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?
I don't really know.

2097
02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:40.420 line:82%
I only hope this does
not turn into a romance.

2098
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:46.500 line:82%
Oh dear, what's going on?
I don't really know.

2099
02:50:47.130 --> 02:50:53.210 line:82%
But if this is a romance,
then so be it.

2100
02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:37.300 line:82%
Pooja's last entry is after this.
Get her ready and bring her here.

2101
02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:39.840 line:82%
Don't worry. Nisha's getting
her ready and bringing her.

2102
02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:44.000 line:82%
Thanks.

2103
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:48.300 line:82%
Don't make this mistake, Pooja.

2104
02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:55.340 line:82%
Very few people are lucky

2105
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:58.840 line:82%
enough to love
and to be loved.

2106
02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:06.340 line:82%
You can't break the tie
which He has ordained.

2107
02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:09.380 line:82%
You can't break it.

2108
02:52:13.880 --> 02:52:19.590 line:82%
I've spent my years giving
love, the name of friendship.

2109
02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:26.340 line:82%
Now, you're going to spend
the rest of your life

2110
02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:28.750 line:82%
giving friendship,
the name of love.

2111
02:52:30.130 --> 02:52:31.840 line:82%
This is a betrayal!

2112
02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:36.090 line:82%
A betrayal of love
a betrayal of friendship.

2113
02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:38.630 line:82%
Don't do such a thing!

2114
02:52:52.340 --> 02:52:53.800 line:82%
This is our last meeting.

2115
02:52:55.300 --> 02:52:56.880 line:82%
I'm getting married tomorrow.

2116
02:52:58.550 --> 02:53:01.550 line:82%
I don't want to meet you
ever again after today.

2117
02:53:03.460 --> 02:53:06.090 line:82%
Just assume that I was
never a part of your life.

2118
02:53:24.250 --> 02:53:27.090 line:82%
I want to ask you
something before I go.

2119
02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:32.050 line:82%
Did you ever love me

2120
02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:39.130 line:82%
even for a single day
or a single moment?

2121
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:44.960 line:82%
This line is not in the play.
Raju!

2122
02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:47.170 line:82%
Tell me just once

2123
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:52.960 line:82%
have you ever really loved me?
Even for a moment?

2124
02:53:55.550 --> 02:53:57.960 line:82%
-What is Rahul saying?
-Shut up.

2125
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:06.210 line:82%
I won't leave without an
answer to this question.

2126
02:54:08.590 --> 02:54:10.170 line:82%
I'm not going!

2127
02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:18.300 line:82%
Did you ever love me,
even for a single moment?

2128
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:23.750 line:82%
-No.
-What did you say?

2129
02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:26.340 line:82%
I didn't hear that.

2130
02:54:27.380 --> 02:54:31.670 line:82%
-No.
-Speak up, I couldn't hear.

2131
02:54:33.550 --> 02:54:36.840 line:82%
-No.
-Louder, louder

2132
02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:40.840 line:82%
No, I've never loved you.

2133
02:54:42.250 --> 02:54:45.590 line:82%
Not for a day,
not for a moment.

2134
02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:48.090 line:82%
Never.

2135
02:54:51.550 --> 02:54:53.210 line:82%
That is all I wanted to hear.

2136
02:55:02.420 --> 02:55:06.920 line:82%
Rahul you'll remember
my name, won't you?

2137
02:55:31.210 --> 02:55:33.500 line:82%
What can I tell you
about Rahul?

2138
02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:35.340 line:82%
Where do I begin?

2139
02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:41.130 line:82%
Well, you should realize that
I've never met anyone like him.

2140
02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:45.420 line:82%
Sometimes he's an angel,
sometimes, a devil.

2141
02:55:45.630 --> 02:55:48.800 line:82%
Sometimes he's crazy,
sometimes he's a genius.

2142
02:55:49.500 --> 02:55:51.380 line:82%
Sometimes, he scolds so harshly

2143
02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:54.840 line:82%
and sometimes he makes
funny faces and makes me laugh.

2144
02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:58.380 line:82%
At times he's more stubborn
than a child

2145
02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:01.880 line:82%
and at times
he's a beloved companion.

2146
02:56:03.050 --> 02:56:08.210 line:82%
What he is or is not, I cannot
really express in words

2147
02:56:09.090 --> 02:56:12.710 line:82%
but I don't know why,
I feel that

2148
02:56:31.630 --> 02:56:36.170 line:82%
when he looks at me,
I feel beautiful.

2149
02:56:38.380 --> 02:56:42.380 line:82%
When he laughs,
I feel like dancing.

2150
02:56:43.090 --> 02:56:46.750 line:82%
When he's upset, I feel
like holding him in my arms.

2151
02:56:47.380 --> 02:56:51.300 line:82%
When he loves me,
my eyes fill with tears.

2152
02:56:53.170 --> 02:56:55.340 line:82%
He's made me realize

2153
02:56:56.090 --> 02:56:59.880 line:82%
that I am made for him
and he for me.

2154
02:57:02.210 --> 02:57:04.050 line:82%
I love him very much

2155
02:57:05.550 --> 02:57:09.210 line:82%
not for one day
or one moment

2156
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:12.210 line:82%
but for my whole life.

2157
02:57:14.380 --> 02:57:17.550 line:82%
I love you, Rahul.
I love you.

2158
02:57:45.210 --> 02:57:46.300 line:82%
Yes.

2159
02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:48.000 line:82%
Rahul!

2160
02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:54.340 line:82%
Now that I've seen them,
I believe that someone, somewhere

2161
02:57:54.420 --> 02:57:55.750 line:82%
has been made for me as well.

2162
02:57:56.920 --> 02:57:58.710 line:82%
-Isn't that so?
-Yes.

2163
02:58:01.550 --> 02:58:04.090 line:82%
My name is Ajay. Yours?

2164
02:58:04.250 --> 02:58:06.800 line:82%
-I'm Nisha.
-Nisha!

2165
02:58:08.050 --> 02:58:10.630 line:82%
-Are you married?
-What?

2166
02:58:27.250 --> 02:58:31.380 line:82%
The heart is crazy,
and the heart is besotted.

2167
02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:36.210 line:82%
The heart is crazy,
and the heart is besotted.

2168
02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:40.565 line:82%
It brings along sleepless nights.

2169
02:58:40.786 --> 02:58:44.630 line:82%
It steals sleep and solace.

2170
02:58:45.210 --> 02:58:48.840 line:82%
It shows them the path of love.

2171
02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:53.250 line:82%
It brings joy and tears.

2172
02:58:53.340 --> 02:58:55.420 line:82%
The heart is crazy.

2173
02:58:55.500 --> 02:58:57.460 line:82%
The heart is besotted.

2174
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:59.750 line:82%
The heart is crazy.

2175
02:58:59.840 --> 02:59:02.000 line:82%
The heart is besotted.

2176
02:59:02.090 --> 02:59:06.300 line:82%
The heart is crazy,
and the heart is besotted.

2177
02:59:06.380 --> 02:59:10.590 line:82%
The heart is crazy,
and the heart is besotted.
