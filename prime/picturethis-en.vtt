00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.916 line:83%
Yeah! Five pounds, bitches!
We are so screwed.

158
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000 line:83%
God, he's coming.

159
00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:05.791 line:83%
-You deal with him. I'm not.
-It's okay, I got this.

160
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:08.791 line:83%
Hi. Hey. Hi, welcome to the Ninth Mandala.

161
00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:09.833 line:83%
How can I help you?

162
00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:12.458 line:83%
Yeah, I need some passport
photos taken, actually.

163
00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:18.041 line:83%
Yeah, but I need my visa sorted,
and they won't accept these.

164
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:20.750 line:83%
-No idea why.
-Interesting attire.

165
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.875 line:83%
I'm so sorry I can't help you.
This is a portraiture studio.

166
00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.041 line:83%
You could try Sainsbury's
on Bethnal Green Road.

167
00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:28.583 line:83%
Look, you got loads of cameras
over there! I spy your subject.

168
00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:29.958 line:83%
There's a printer over there,

169
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:33.375 line:83%
and you can cut them with these, no?

170
00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:35.458 line:83%
-I think you need to leave.
-Calm down, dear.

171
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.666 line:83%
I am calm, dickhead. Now get out.

172
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.166 line:83%
-Seriously, get out!
-Yeah, get out, you knob.

173
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.625 line:83%
And each toe does not need
its own chamber. Go on.

174
00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.666 line:83%
[bell rings]

175
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.500 line:83%
-Thank God he's gone.
-Yeah.

176
00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.250 line:83%
We should think about passport photos.

177
00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:53.583 line:83%
-We'd be raking in the cash.
-No, Jay. Don't listen to him.

178
00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.625 line:83%
Remember, we're making art.

179
00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:57.708 line:83%
This whole studio
is dedicated to my grandma.

180
00:08:57.791 --> 00:08:59.625 line:83%
I know. And her dream
of being a photographer.

181
00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:01.791 line:83%
But every letter we're getting
through the door

182
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.083 line:83%
is a red-lined bill.

183
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.250 line:83%
Well, we'll be fine. Just have faith.

184
00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:10.333 line:83%
We're not fine! We need
to find some money soon.

185
00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:13.375 line:83%
Which means... you might
need to loosen up a little bit.

186
00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:15.125 line:83%
Huh! I am loose.

187
00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:17.458 line:83%
Hon, I'm loose.

188
00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:21.291 line:83%
You're so tight we could mine
diamonds out of your ass.

189
00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:25.166 line:83%
Well, speaking of diamonds,
today I found out my mum

190
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.125 line:83%
has been saving all this jewellery for me.

191
00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:28.166 line:83%
For my wedding.

192
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.500 line:83%
Enough to pay our debt off 20 times over.

193
00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:33.291 line:83%
And it's all in this bank
in Golders Green.

194
00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:35.250 line:83%
We need to rob that bank immeeds.

195
00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:37.458 line:83%
The only way we can get our
hands on it is if I get married

196
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:40.208 line:83%
-and that is never happening.
-Okay, but the bank has said

197
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.583 line:83%
that we need to pay our arrears
in the next four weeks,

198
00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:46.166 line:83%
or they'll shut us down.
So, we need to marry you off.

199
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.500 line:83%
Or at least get you on a date.

200
00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:49.583 line:83%
-So, come out with me tonight.
-No!

201
00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:51.000 line:83%
[clears throat] I have plans.

202
00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:53.125 line:83%
Plus, it's Sonal's engagement tomorrow.

203
00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:54.333 line:83%
Okay, well, I have a plus one

204
00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:56.833 line:83%
at a private view
on Redchurch Street tonight.

205
00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.916 line:83%
Which is just down the road,
so no excuses.

206
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.666 line:83%
There'll be loads of fitties there.

207
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.791 line:83%
I'm busy.

208
00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:04.583 line:83%
P, you cannot
just stay here watering plants.

209
00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:07.125 line:83%
-I love my plants!
-You'll turn into melancholy.

210
00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:09.083 line:83%
No, I won't. I won't turn into melancholy.

211
00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:11.458 line:83%
You won't lie in bed,
endlessly browsing Deliveroo,

212
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:14.458 line:83%
-dreaming of Shashi Kapoor?
-I love Shashi Kapoor.

213
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:16.041 line:83%
Come on, what have you got to lose?

214
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:19.583 line:83%
-You might even get some D.
-That is highly unlikely.

215
00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:21.541 line:83%
It's like an abandoned subway down there.

216
00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:24.458 line:83%
Well, go and wash your subway.
We're going out.

217
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.166 line:83%
-Come on.
-Really?

218
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.666 line:83%
Yes, go on. Scrub it.

00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:46.541 line:83%
Ooh.

222
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:49.625 line:83%
What about him?

223
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.666 line:83%
No. Come on, come on, go.

224
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.875 line:83%
Him?

225
00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.916 line:83%
Unusual look, but, no.

226
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.666 line:83%
Look, he's hot, behind me.

227
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:03.000 line:83%
Look, Jay, stop.

228
00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:04.833 line:83%
-So, what about the apps, then?
-[sighs]

229
00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:06.666 line:83%
Gonna download them again, or...?

230
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.583 line:83%
Jay, I hate the apps.
Rejection is always imminent.

231
00:11:09.666 --> 00:11:11.541 line:83%
Before, after, during sex.

232
00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:13.458 line:83%
-During?
-Yeah, it doesn't matter.

233
00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:17.166 line:83%
They're a headfuck, anyway.
So, I'm done with the apps.

234
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.000 line:83%
Do you remember Big Dick Dinesh?

235
00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:22.166 line:83%
We don't talk about Big Dick Dinesh.

236
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.375 line:83%
Shh!

237
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.666 line:83%
Seriously, when were you last in love?

-Actual love?
-Yes.

Oh, my God!

241
00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:41.000 line:83%
It was what's-his-name,
wasn't it? Charlie.

242
00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:44.000 line:83%
Was... Was it Charlie?

243
00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.000 line:83%
Oh, my God. Pia, that was
at school. Are you serious?

244
00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.958 line:83%
Can you not love-shame me?

245
00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:54.125 line:83%
What happened to you two, then?

246
00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:56.333 line:83%
He just turned out to be
another suburban boy

247

that wanted to stay in Welwyn
and run the family business.

248
00:11:58.833 --> 00:12:01.083 line:83%
I, on the other hand,
if you haven't already noticed,

249
00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:03.458 line:83%
-I'm a smoking-hot diva.
-Plumes of hotness.

250
00:12:03.541 --> 00:12:06.583 line:83%
And I had things I wanted,
needed, to do with my life,

251
00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:08.958 line:83%
like go to uni.

252
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:12.958 line:83%
And then that led to...
irreconcilable differences.

253
00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:17.208 line:83%
Anyway... I did go
and visit him that Christmas.

254
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.583 line:83%
And then he'd already hooked up

255
00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:21.333 line:83%
with that stunning red-head called Lucy.

256
00:12:21.416 --> 00:12:24.500 line:83%
Lucy. It's unbelievable.

257

Mm! And then, check this.

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:28.791 line:83%
Now he's gonna be the best man
at Son's wedding.

260

Great, first shaming, now the ghosting.

261
00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:40.125 line:83%
Sorry, babe, but over your shoulder.

262
00:12:41.083 --> 00:12:42.833 line:83%
No, don't look yet!
Don't look, don't look!

263
00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:48.000 line:83%
I can't tell who he's winking at.

264
00:12:48.083 --> 00:12:49.666 line:83%
Oh, it's definitely me.

265
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.833 line:83%
But I would consider sharing him

266
00:12:52.916 --> 00:12:55.041 line:83%
as a plus one at tomorrow's
engagement party,

267
00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:56.125 line:83%
if you're interested.

268

This ain't no ride-share, baby.

269
00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:00.375 line:83%
Fine by me.

00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:02.708 line:83%
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

271
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:15.375 line:83%

Forty-three. Thank you very much.

465
00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:13.958 line:83%
One more two-digit number, please.

466
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:15.541 line:83%
Let's try sixty-nine.

467
00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:18.458 line:83%
-Yes, let's! Lovely number.
-Shh!

468
00:22:25.708 --> 00:22:27.500 line:83%
Okay.

469
00:22:27.583 --> 00:22:28.541 line:83%
-[gasps]
-Forty-three

470
00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:31.458 line:83%
-multiplied by sixty-nine.
-[exhales]

471
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:35.125 line:83%
Two thousand, nine hundred
and sixty-eight.

472
00:22:37.083 --> 00:22:39.083 line:83%
Ladies and gentlemen, he is correct.

473
00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:42.333 line:83%
-Make some noise. Well done.
-[cheering]

474
00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:46.208 line:83%
Guys, we'll be back very shortly
with some more entertainment.

475
00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:49.041 line:83%
What? He's adorable.

476
00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:50.500 line:83%
That's Charlie.

477
00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:54.083 line:83%
Charlie, your first love, Charlie?

478
00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:55.958 line:83%
Yes.

479
00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:58.375 line:83%
-Drink?
-Yep!

480
00:22:58.458 --> 00:22:59.458 line:83%
[both] Double.

481
00:22:59.541 --> 00:23:01.500 line:83%
Come on. Jane, photos.

482
00:23:01.583 --> 00:23:03.583 line:83%
-You gonna go talk to him then?
-Mm-mm!

483
00:23:03.666 --> 00:23:04.958 line:83%
What do you mean, "Mm-mm"?

484
00:23:05.041 --> 00:23:08.000 line:83%
If he wants to talk, he can come to me.
I'm not running to him.

485
00:23:09.416 --> 00:23:11.916 line:83%
Oh, what's going on here, then?

486
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.791 line:83%
Please explain, immeeds.

487
00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:15.750 line:83%
Oh, it's for the family back home.

488
00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:17.958 line:83%
-So they think they're still--?
-Together, yeah.

489
00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:19.000 line:83%
No.

490
00:23:19.083 --> 00:23:22.208 line:83%
No one in India knows they've
been divorced for 15 years.

491
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:25.166 line:83%
They're gonna continue this charade
for the whole wedding.

492
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.083 line:83%
It's Jane I feel sorry for.

493
00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:30.041 line:83%
-Okay.
-Pia? Beta, come.

494
00:23:30.125 --> 00:23:32.208 line:83%
-Can you get me another?
-Yeah.

495
00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:35.833 line:83%
-Hi, Jane, hi.
-[Mum] Come, come, Beta.

496
00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:37.666 line:83%
-Okay.
-Thank you, Jane.

497
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.708 line:83%
All the pieces in the jigsaw
are coming together, huh, Sonal?

498
00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:43.291 line:83%
But we need to keep an eye
on this five-dates business.

499
00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:46.583 line:83%
Make sure Pia also secures her partner.

500
00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:49.416 line:83%
I don't think that's necessary.

501
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.208 line:83%
Wait. I've got an idea.

502
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:55.708 line:83%
Why don't we each plan a date
for Pia before the wedding?

503
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:57.958 line:83%
She then chooses a winner

504
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:00.750 line:83%
and brings them as a date
on our wedding day.

505
00:24:00.833 --> 00:24:02.875 line:83%
That sounds like a TV show
I'd like to binge.

506
00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:06.791 line:83%
That is a great idea! Excellent.

507
00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:07.916 line:83%
I'm gonna kill you.

508
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000 line:83%
Mum, I don't really believe
in this astrology crap.

509
00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:14.125 line:83%
And, uh, I don't wanna get married.

510
00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:16.791 line:83%
-Come here, Beta.
-[chuckles] Okay.

511
00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:17.875 line:83%
Thanks, Mum.

512
00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:21.666 line:83%
Beta, what if I was to walk out,
get hit by a truck and die,

513
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.541 line:83%
-and this was the last time we spoke.
-Dad!

514
00:24:23.625 --> 00:24:25.291 line:83%
Imagine how you would feel.

515
00:24:25.375 --> 00:24:28.625 line:83%
Mum, Mum. Still at my
engagement, okay? Keep it light.

516
00:24:28.708 --> 00:24:30.708 line:83%
You would never
be able to stop regretting.

517
00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:32.166 line:83%
It would eat you up inside,

518
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.083 line:83%
this pain, but it would be too late.

519
00:24:34.166 --> 00:24:37.083 line:83%
In which case, the sooner
we sort these dates, the better.

520
00:24:37.166 --> 00:24:38.291 line:83%
Correct.

521
00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:42.208 line:83%
Listen, this is just five dates, okay?

522
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:44.291 line:83%
Now look, I don't believe
in astrology either,

523
00:24:44.375 --> 00:24:45.458 line:83%
although I am a Pisces,

524
00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:47.666 line:83%
but I do believe in sex,
mischief, and romance,

525
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.500 line:83%
and this is just the place
for all of that.

526
00:24:49.583 --> 00:24:53.291 line:83%
Especially the sex part,
which you need. Badly.

527
00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:57.291 line:83%
Jay, we don't need men
to make us feel whole.

528
00:24:57.375 --> 00:24:59.458 line:83%
-We've got--
-Look, PiPi,

529
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:02.208 line:83%
I know you must have all types
of shit stored up

530
00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:03.166 line:83%
that you can't deal with.

531
00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:05.416 line:83%
Like how I'm obviously Mum's favourite,

532
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.041 line:83%
even though you are the firstborn.

533
00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:09.833 line:83%
-What?
-Don't you ever think about

534
00:25:09.916 --> 00:25:11.458 line:83%
how much Mum and Dad sacrificed?

535
00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:12.458 line:83%
Of course I do.

536
00:25:12.541 --> 00:25:14.916 line:83%
So this would mean
a hell of a lot to them.

537
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.500 line:83%
And we only just so happen
to be in the perfect place

538
00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:22.000 line:83%
to kick this off. Be right back.

539
00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:24.583 line:83%
Jay, this party is proper Welwyn.

540
00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:26.583 line:83%
There's no way
my soulmate's gonna be here.

541
00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:28.958 line:83%
-[Jay] I really hope he is.
-[Sonal] Pia?

542
00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:31.500 line:83%
If only to keep your parents
from twigging about the studio.

543
00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:32.833 line:83%
"Business is booming"?

544
00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:36.083 line:83%
-Look who it is! Akshay Dham.
-Hello, Pia.

545
00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:38.375 line:83%
-Dham! Darl! Oh.
-Hi.

546
00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:40.750 line:83%
It's been a while. You're looking well.

547
00:25:40.833 --> 00:25:42.708 line:83%
-And you.
-You still working for my mum?

548
00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:44.208 line:83%
Yes, well, what can I say?

549
00:25:44.291 --> 00:25:47.083 line:83%
I got caught in her orbit,
couldn't escape.

550
00:25:47.166 --> 00:25:49.416 line:83%
Your mother has
the gravitational pull of...

551
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.791 line:83%
Uranus?

552
00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:54.791 line:83%
I... need to check the flowers.

553
00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:58.208 line:83%
-I will assist you.
-I need to come as well.

554
00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:00.500 line:83%
-I'm coming. I'm coming!
-No, no, no! You stay.

555
00:26:00.583 --> 00:26:01.916 line:83%
Try and... enjoy.

556
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.958 line:83%
[chuckles]

557
00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:09.708 line:83%
-That was subtle.
-Yeah.

558
00:26:09.791 --> 00:26:11.708 line:83%
First time being ambushed at a wedding?

559
00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:13.458 line:83%
I'm a single brown man in my 30s.

560
00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:15.625 line:83%
This is not my first rodeo.

561
00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:17.833 line:83%
You do have that desirable
bachelor feel about you.

562
00:26:17.916 --> 00:26:20.083 line:83%
That will get aunties on the case.

563
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:22.291 line:83%
The ones with the daughters, right?

564
00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:25.125 line:83%
-Daughters. Occasionally sons.
-Hmm!

565
00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:27.291 line:83%
I was at a wedding in Harrow
the other week.

566
00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:29.083 line:83%
The aunties there were very progressive.

567
00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:30.333 line:83%
Hmm!

568
00:26:30.416 --> 00:26:32.000 line:83%
I'm actually gonna make my escape.

569
00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:35.250 line:83%
I have a pile of marking
due tomorrow morning.

570
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.791 line:83%
Gotcha. I would avoid that corner.

571
00:26:37.875 --> 00:26:39.500 line:83%
-[Akshay] Good shout.
-[Pia] Yeah.

572
00:26:39.583 --> 00:26:42.250 line:83%
-Good luck.
-Thank you. Yeah.

573
00:26:42.333 --> 00:26:44.250 line:83%
[upbeat music]

-Thank you, Pia.

575
00:26:46.083 --> 00:26:47.333 line:83%
[laughs]

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.125 line:83%
[laughs]

578
00:26:54.208 --> 00:26:56.041 line:83%
Hey.

579
00:26:56.125 --> 00:26:57.250 line:83%
-Hey!
-How's it going?

580
00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:58.875 line:83%
-Hey. Yeah, good.
-Good to see you.

581
00:26:58.958 --> 00:27:00.250 line:83%
-You, too. Long time.
-Yeah.

582
00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:02.666 line:83%
What are you doing here? Wedding security?

583
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.500 line:83%
Oh, no, I am the best man, actually.

584
00:27:05.583 --> 00:27:07.791 line:83%
-Yeah.
-Surely you know that, right?

585
00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:09.875 line:83%
-Yeah, I forgot.
-You forgot?

586
00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:14.500 line:83%
-How are you?
-I'm good. I'm good.

587
00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:16.666 line:83%
Um, still at the restaurant in Welwyn.

588
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.000 line:83%
Changed the whole menu.

589
00:27:18.083 --> 00:27:20.625 line:83%
We're doing Pan-Asian fusion
mixed with European fine dining.

590
00:27:20.708 --> 00:27:21.625 line:83%
It's going well.

591
00:27:21.708 --> 00:27:24.833 line:83%
Makes a lot of sense
cos you love exotic flavours.

592
00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:27.000 line:83%
Bit of spice.

593
00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:28.583 line:83%
Sorry, not sari!

594
00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:34.250 line:83%
[Charlie chuckles] Okay.
[clears throat] Did you, uh...

595
00:27:34.333 --> 00:27:36.708 line:83%
Did you come alone tonight,
or did you bring someone?

596
00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:38.166 line:83%
No, no, brought a close friend.

597
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.208 line:83%
I feel bad, he doesn't really know anyone.

598
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:42.833 line:83%
-Pia!
-Is that him there?

599
00:27:42.916 --> 00:27:44.500 line:83%
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

600
00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:45.750 line:83%
-Poor guy.
-Yeah.

601
00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:47.791 line:83%
I've never seen him
look so depressed in his life.

602
00:27:47.875 --> 00:27:49.000 line:83%
So how are you?

603
00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:52.666 line:83%
I heard that you've got your own
photography studio in Hackney.

604
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.791 line:83%
It's literally, like,
what you've always wanted.

605
00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:57.000 line:83%
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

606
00:27:57.083 --> 00:27:59.125 line:83%
I'm sure that degree
in Renaissance Literature's

607
00:27:59.208 --> 00:28:00.291 line:83%
really coming in handy.

608
00:28:00.375 --> 00:28:02.208 line:83%
Yeah, well, I've heard
that you can't seem to shake

609
00:28:02.291 --> 00:28:04.125 line:83%
your overwhelming urge to date red-heads.

610
00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:07.833 line:83%
Charlie! Charlie! [laughs]

611
00:28:07.916 --> 00:28:09.000 line:83%
-Hey.
-This is amazing.

612
00:28:09.083 --> 00:28:10.375 line:83%
-Yeah.
-So sorry I'm late.

613
00:28:10.458 --> 00:28:13.541 line:83%
I definitely was not watching
Love Island.
[laughs]

614
00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:16.541 line:83%
-[Charlie] Heh-hey!
-[laughs]

615
00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:18.250 line:83%
This is Pia. Pia, this is Lily.

616
00:28:18.333 --> 00:28:20.041 line:83%
-Hi.
-Hi. Hey, I'm... I'm Pia.

617
00:28:20.125 --> 00:28:21.708 line:83%
Oh, bring it in!

Yeah, I bet she is.

631
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:52.041 line:83%
This isn't really going exactly
how I imagined it would.

I understand it's a bit weird
and it's been a long time,

637
00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:04.916 line:83%
but I thought it would be
a good opportunity to catch up,

638
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.583 line:83%
spend some time together like we used to.

639
00:29:06.666 --> 00:29:09.250 line:83%

You, me, Lily, it'll be great.

Well, I haven't asked,
but she might be into it.

641
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:14.208 line:83%
Ha-ha. Very funny. Threesome jokes.

642

"I wanna support you.
You could be independent."

648
00:29:41.958 --> 00:29:44.375 line:83%
And then you know what? They just leave.

649
00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:47.250 line:83%
Hmm! Case in point.

orange juice and a bit of turmeric.

706
00:32:21.708 --> 00:32:23.416 line:83%
Because you're very spicy yourself.

707
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.333 line:83%
And I call it a Pia colada.

708

720
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:53.750 line:83%
You know, "servants"
is such a loaded word.

721
00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:57.166 line:83%
These people, they're like my family.

that no one on this Earth has seen.

727

-It's okay.

730
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.666 line:83%
But really family.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.000 line:83%
-I get it.
-Yeah.

732
00:33:15.083 --> 00:33:16.833 line:83%
-It's hard with family.
-Mm-hmm.

733
00:33:16.916 --> 00:33:19.583 line:83%

738
00:33:27.416 --> 00:33:29.208 line:83%
I don't... I don't do that to my mum.

739
00:33:29.291 --> 00:33:31.541 line:83%
Yeah, same. No, I'd never do that.

740
00:33:31.625 --> 00:33:33.833 line:83%
-It's... Mummy.
-Yeah.

741

742
00:33:35.875 --> 00:33:37.750 line:83%
Okay. Um, where are you from?

743
00:33:37.833 --> 00:33:40.375 line:83%
Me? I'm from here, there, everywhere.

744
00:33:40.458 --> 00:33:42.083 line:83%

745
00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:44.958 line:83%

747
00:33:46.208 --> 00:33:48.541 line:83%
No, but, uh, my sister and I,

748
00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:51.208 line:83%
we grew up watching
all the Bollywood movies.

749
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:53.166 line:83%
-Mm-hmm.

751

-Or, um, "Martin, you bastard!"

752
00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:02.750 line:83%
Mmm... I'm not really into
Bollywood. It's very tacky.

753
00:34:02.833 --> 00:34:04.833 line:83%
-Oh.
-I'm more into Western cinema.

754
00:34:04.916 --> 00:34:08.041 line:83%
The classics, you know.
Like
Speed
and
Speed 2.

755

-um, how the soundtracks--
-Shh!

Oh, my God, Pia.

758

00:34:21.083 --> 00:34:22.958 line:83%
Please tell me your contour regime.

761
00:34:23.041 --> 00:34:24.791 line:83%
I-I don't have a regime.

762
00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:26.291 line:83%
It's natural?!

763
00:34:26.375 --> 00:34:27.458 line:83%
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

764
00:34:27.541 --> 00:34:30.875 line:83%
Pia, I would literally
stab a baby in the throat

765
00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:32.416 line:83%

Okay, Pia, let's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

769
00:34:40.666 --> 00:34:42.500 line:83%
-Enough foreplay. [chuckles]
-[laughs]

770
00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:44.333 line:83%
Let's jump into bed.

771

Tell me about the Ninth Mandala.

772

Of course. And let me
tell you something, Pia.

774
00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:57.166 line:83%

[chuckles]

1086
00:48:28.208 --> 00:48:30.375 line:83%
-I've got you these.
-Oh.

1087
00:48:31.708 --> 00:48:32.708 line:83%
From the restaurant.

1088
00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:34.958 line:83%
My pastry chef's a bit of
a wizard, so they're good.

1089
00:48:35.958 --> 00:48:37.291 line:83%
Wow, thank you.

1090
00:48:37.375 --> 00:48:39.000 line:83%
You wanna, uh, show me around?

1091
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:41.250 line:83%
Yeah, sure. The, uh,
the studio's this way.

1092
00:48:41.333 --> 00:48:42.875 line:83%
This is the space.

1093
00:48:48.416 --> 00:48:51.625 line:83%
Wow. This is stunning.

1094
00:48:51.708 --> 00:48:53.916 line:83%
-Yeah, you like it?
-I do.

1095
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.875 line:83%
I really do.

1096
00:48:56.958 --> 00:48:58.625 line:83%
I feel like I could take
a thousand pictures

1097
00:48:58.708 --> 00:49:00.291 line:83%
and I wouldn't be able to get that look.

1098
00:49:00.375 --> 00:49:01.833 line:83%
Hmm. It's my favourite, too.

1099
00:49:01.916 --> 00:49:03.958 line:83%
You know... [chuckles]

1100
00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:06.625 line:83%
I kind of thought that she would
be more your vibe.

1101
00:49:06.708 --> 00:49:08.791 line:83%
-You know what I'm saying?
-Yeah.

1102
00:49:08.875 --> 00:49:11.958 line:83%
I actually think
I took her to Nando's once.

1103
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:14.583 line:83%
No, you didn't. Did you?

1104
00:49:15.166 --> 00:49:16.833 line:83%
[both laugh]

1105
00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:20.625 line:83%
-[Charlie] How do you do it?
-[Pia] What?

1106
00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:23.500 line:83%
Take such good photos. How do you do it?

1107
00:49:23.583 --> 00:49:26.708 line:83%
Oh, you know,
I have a... I have a process.

1108
00:49:29.916 --> 00:49:32.750 line:83%
-Do mine.
-[chuckles] Yeah, okay.

1109
00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:34.916 line:83%
[chuckles] Um...

1110
00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:39.375 line:83%
How do I look?

1111
00:49:42.666 --> 00:49:45.750 line:83%
Yeah, that's better.
You look... you look lovely.

1112
00:49:48.083 --> 00:49:50.125 line:83%
Wow, those eyebrows.

1113
00:49:50.208 --> 00:49:52.583 line:83%
-[chuckles]
-Mental as ever.

1114
00:49:52.666 --> 00:49:54.541 line:83%
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

1115
00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:55.666 line:83%
Do you pluck them?

1116
00:49:56.791 --> 00:49:58.416 line:83%
No, I, uh, I don't pluck them.

1117
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.625 line:83%
-[Pia chuckles] Wax them?
-I don't wax them either.

1118
00:50:01.708 --> 00:50:04.000 line:83%
But if I don't trim them
for three, four weeks,

1119
00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:04.958 line:83%
I start to look like...

1120
00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:07.958 line:83%
You know the Swedish Chef
from
The Muppets?

1121
00:50:08.041 --> 00:50:09.791 line:83%
-I'm familiar.
-It's not good.

1122
00:50:09.875 --> 00:50:12.166 line:83%
[Muppet voice] It's lucky
you run a restaurant, then!

1123
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:13.500 line:83%
-[laughs]
-[camera clicks]

1124
00:50:13.583 --> 00:50:16.625 line:83%
Okay, I'm just gonna go and...
do something else.

1125
00:50:16.708 --> 00:50:19.750 line:83%
Just, um... relax.

1126
00:50:19.833 --> 00:50:21.541 line:83%
Is your boyfriend here?

1127
00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:23.375 line:83%
Boyfriend is kind of strong a word.

1128
00:50:23.458 --> 00:50:26.125 line:83%
[clears throat] I'm dating
a few different people.

1129
00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:27.208 line:83%
[inhales]

1130
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:29.958 line:83%
Yeah, just exploring
opportunities, you know.

1131
00:50:30.041 --> 00:50:31.541 line:83%
I see.

1132
00:50:31.625 --> 00:50:33.750 line:83%
[quietly] What, you jealous or something?

1133
00:50:33.833 --> 00:50:35.166 line:83%
-What did you say?
-I said,

1134
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:36.958 line:83%
can I ask you a question?

1135
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:38.458 line:83%
Sure, you can ask me a question.

1136
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:40.500 line:83%
-Why are you here?
-Party favours.

1137
00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:42.541 line:83%
Why didn't you call me?
Why come all the way here?

1138
00:50:42.625 --> 00:50:43.666 line:83%
I wanted to see you.

1139
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.958 line:83%
-Why?
-Why do you think?

1140
00:50:47.083 --> 00:50:48.458 line:83%
You tell me, I'm asking.

1141
00:50:49.291 --> 00:50:51.125 line:83%
-Because...
-Because?

1142
00:50:51.208 --> 00:50:53.833 line:83%
Because I still think about you, Pia.

1143
00:50:53.916 --> 00:50:55.208 line:83%
[camera clicks]

1144
00:50:59.583 --> 00:51:00.708 line:83%
That's my process.

1145
00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:04.791 line:83%
I just ask questions
and it just draws out a reaction,

1146
00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:07.333 line:83%
and you get a really authentic photo.

1147
00:51:07.416 --> 00:51:09.166 line:83%
You drew that out,
you're not gonna respond?

1148
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:11.125 line:83%
[chuckles] Guys, guys! Sorry.

1149
00:51:11.208 --> 00:51:14.416 line:83%
Look what... look what
I just found. [chuckles]

1150
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.875 line:83%
-Pia...
-[Jay chuckles]

1151
00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:20.083 line:83%
-Um...
-Sorry, shall I come back?

1152
00:51:20.166 --> 00:51:21.750 line:83%
No, no, no. No, no. Um...

1153
00:51:21.833 --> 00:51:24.541 line:83%
[chuckles] Yeah, I forgot about these.

1154
00:51:25.166 --> 00:51:26.791 line:83%
Is that you and Sonal?

1155
00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:28.375 line:83%
Yeah, yeah.

1156
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.791 line:83%
Actually, Jay, you've given me an idea

1157
00:51:32.875 --> 00:51:34.416 line:83%
-for the party favours.
-Go on.

1158
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.041 line:83%
We should do a little photo album.

1159
00:51:36.125 --> 00:51:38.458 line:83%
Photos of the bride and groom
from childhood to present.

1160
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:40.416 line:83%
-Cute, I like it.
-Yeah, easy.

1161
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.125 line:83%
And then we can do disposable cameras.

1162
00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:43.291 line:83%
The guests can take photos

1163
00:51:43.375 --> 00:51:45.125 line:83%
and we put them together
in a wedding album.

1164
00:51:45.208 --> 00:51:46.541 line:83%
Charlie, you can do Sam's photos?

1165
00:51:46.625 --> 00:51:47.625 line:83%
Sure.

1166
00:51:47.708 --> 00:51:49.166 line:83%
[Pia] I'll do Sonal's. It'll be great.

1167
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:50.583 line:83%
Yeah. Nice one. It's a good idea.

1168
00:51:50.666 --> 00:51:52.583 line:83%
-Yay, we did it!
-[Jay] Yay!

1169
00:51:52.666 --> 00:51:55.125 line:83%
-We are go, team.
-[chuckles] Wahey!

1170
00:51:55.208 --> 00:51:56.750 line:83%
-[squawks]
-Whoo!

1171
00:51:56.833 --> 00:51:57.916 line:83%
-Charlie!
-Yeah.

1172
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.791 line:83%
[clears throat]
No, it's a really good idea.

1173
00:51:59.875 --> 00:52:00.791 line:83%
There's a lot of people,

1174
00:52:00.875 --> 00:52:02.791 line:83%
so I figure the costs are gonna add up

1175
00:52:02.875 --> 00:52:03.791 line:83%
and I just wanted to say

1176
00:52:03.875 --> 00:52:07.041 line:83%
I'm very happy to cover the finances.

1177
00:52:07.125 --> 00:52:09.500 line:83%
Aw, Charlie, that's nice.

1178
00:52:09.583 --> 00:52:12.916 line:83%
I mean, it's fine.
We'll, uh, we'll cover it ourselves.

1179
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.083 line:83%
Well, Pia, he's just...

1180
00:52:14.166 --> 00:52:16.208 line:83%
Sonal did write in her wedding bible

1181
00:52:16.291 --> 00:52:17.750 line:83%
that we should do this together.

1182
00:52:17.833 --> 00:52:19.250 line:83%
That's very generous of you.

1183
00:52:19.333 --> 00:52:22.666 line:83%
I just... I think it's easier
if I maybe do this on my own.

1184
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.166 line:83%
[Charlie] I insist.

1185
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.041 line:83%
[Pia] Well, she's kind of my sister,

1186
00:52:26.125 --> 00:52:29.791 line:83%
and I'm willing to commit
sacrilege on the Holy Bible.

1187
00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:32.375 line:83%
And, uh, yeah, I think
I'll just... I'll call her.

1188
00:52:32.458 --> 00:52:35.125 line:83%
-She's pretty changeable.
-She's not the only one.

1189
00:52:36.125 --> 00:52:37.500 line:83%
Ooh.

1190
00:52:37.583 --> 00:52:39.083 line:83%
I didn't mean it like that. I just...

1191
00:52:39.166 --> 00:52:40.708 line:83%
It's cool.

1192
00:52:42.583 --> 00:52:44.208 line:83%
I'll see you at the wedding.

1193
00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:46.416 line:83%
Cool.

1194
00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:50.041 line:83%
-[Jay] Bye, Charlie.
-Yep.

1195
00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:59.500 line:83%
Oh, you are a people person, aren't you?

1196
00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:02.083 line:83%
There was a lot of subtext
in that interaction.

1197
00:53:02.166 --> 00:53:03.666 line:83%
I'm exhausted just thinking about it.

1198
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.125 line:83%
Yeah, me, too. I don't wanna
talk about Charlie anymore.

1199
00:53:06.208 --> 00:53:07.750 line:83%
I just wanna... live in the moment.

1233
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.833 line:83%

with some breathing exercises

1234
00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:26.708 line:83%

1235
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:27.750 line:83%
And then...

1236
00:54:29.541 --> 00:54:30.833 line:83%

-What?

Withdrawn.

1392
01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:34.666 line:83%
Just driving.

1393
01:01:35.916 --> 01:01:38.500 line:83%
It's just that spending
so much time with you recently

1394
01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:40.708 line:83%
has made me think about how we used to be.

-Charlie?
-Mm-hmm?

1396

We both knew I wanted to move to London.

1397

You knew it was my dream.

1398
01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:54.208 line:83%
-It was your dream, yeah.
-You can't always put it on me.

1399
01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:56.666 line:83%
I'm not putting it all on you.
We just had a plan.

1400
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:59.041 line:83%
To get back together again
after you graduated from uni.

1401
01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:00.833 line:83%
-Remember?
-But we were 18.

1402
01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:04.125 line:83%
Yeah, we were 18,
and we promised to meet up

1403
01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:06.375 line:83%
after you graduated,
on your 21st birthday,

1404
01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:07.458 line:83%
in Welwyn, remember?

1405
01:02:07.541 --> 01:02:10.500 line:83%
I know! I remember! But we
weren't really in touch anymore!

1406
01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:12.625 line:83%
We weren't, but I still went.

1407
01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:14.166 line:83%
And I waited.

1408
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:17.750 line:83%
Outside of WH Smith in Welwyn,
just as we planned.

1409
01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:22.375 line:83%
Well, I wrote to you every day
in my first year.

1410
01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:24.833 line:83%
You weren't willing to leave Welwyn.
You made that clear.

1411
01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:26.625 line:83%
You knew about my dad and the restaurant!

1412
01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:28.166 line:83%
I couldn't leave him high and dry!

1413
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:30.291 line:83%
You couldn't deal with the fact
I didn't want to go to uni!

1414
01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:32.208 line:83%
-You're being mean.
-I'm not being mean.

1415
01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:33.791 line:83%
It was your choice.

1416
01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:35.875 line:83%
What are we doing, then?
It's unresolvable.

1417
01:02:35.958 --> 01:02:38.541 line:83%
All I know is we had a plan
and I stuck to it,

1418
01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:39.583 line:83%
and you never turned up.

1419
01:02:39.666 --> 01:02:41.291 line:83%
Well, what about you?

1420
01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:44.541 line:83%
You never visited me the whole
time I was at uni, did you?

forgot you were there.

Listen, this thing you two have,

1426
01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:11.708 line:83%
and believe me when I say
it's definitely a thing,

1427
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:13.125 line:83%
it needs sorting out.

1428
01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:16.958 line:83%
Personally, I think you guys
would make a really cute couple.

We just had, um, a difference of opinion

on some fundamental stuff.

No, Mum, I didn't eat his face.

Why didn't you eat his face?
Something wrong with his face?

No, Christ, Mum, I don't know
why I didn't eat Akshay's face.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.875 line:83%
Let's see. I insulted my mum,

1524
01:08:20.958 --> 01:08:23.125 line:83%
my sister kicked me out, quite literally,

1525
01:08:23.208 --> 01:08:25.041 line:83%
and she doesn't wanna talk to me anymore.

1526
01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:27.708 line:83%
So, I'm not invited to the wedding.

Um, come in. Come in, I'll show you.

1543
01:09:09.958 --> 01:09:14.125 line:83%
People think that a photo
is taken with a camera.

1544
01:09:14.208 --> 01:09:15.958 line:83%
-But it's not.
-[phone beeps]

1545
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:19.708 line:83%
Okay, technically, it is.
Um, sorry, let me start again.

1546
01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:22.500 line:83%
[exhales] I'm not very good
at this. Um...

1547
01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:24.916 line:83%
But I am good at taking photos.

1548
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.166 line:83%
I'm really good, actually.

1549
01:09:28.875 --> 01:09:31.875 line:83%
Taking photos is about capturing beauty.

1550
01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:34.166 line:83%
Whatever that might mean to you.

1551
01:09:35.458 --> 01:09:38.375 line:83%
And when you take a photo,
you capture light.

1552
01:09:38.458 --> 01:09:40.458 line:83%
You pluck it straight from the sky.

1553
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.166 line:83%
And...

1554
01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:47.541 line:83%
I guess when I take a photo,
I like to bring out the light

1555
01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:49.083 line:83%
from whoever's in front of my lens.

1556
01:09:49.166 --> 01:09:51.750 line:83%
And then people are always like,
"Take my photo, take my photo."

1557
01:09:51.833 --> 01:09:53.500 line:83%
But I can't take something
that isn't mine.

1558
01:09:53.583 --> 01:09:55.416 line:83%
It's something that we do together.

1559
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.791 line:83%
Something that doesn't exist
unless we're both there.

1560
01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:00.875 line:83%
Like a conversation, or a relationship.

1561
01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:02.916 line:83%
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

1562
01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:07.083 line:83%
Taking a photo is about capturing

1563
01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:10.375 line:83%
a single moment in time
and making it live forever.

1567

1568
01:10:26.416 --> 01:10:28.625 line:83%

1569

Mm-hmm.

1650
01:14:30.958 --> 01:14:32.416 line:83%
It's not very original.

1651
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.416 line:83%
Yes, it was!

1652
01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.208 line:83%
I literally projected images
of queer icons onto the wall.

1653

But what I didn't tell you

1654
01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:45.666 line:83%
was that after I finished
my amazing presentation,

1655
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:48.583 line:83%
Mum stood up and said, "I've got
a chicken to put in the oven."

1656
01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:51.041 line:83%
Then she just walked out.

1657
01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:54.750 line:83%
-That's it? That's all she said?
-Mm-hmm.

1658
01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:57.000 line:83%
And I was so stressed about
what she thought about me

1659
01:14:57.083 --> 01:14:58.250 line:83%
that I didn't bring it up again.

1660
01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:02.125 line:83%
Until about a year later,

1661
01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:04.833 line:83%
I was going out on what would
have been my first date,

1662
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.708 line:83%
and I just told her about him.

1663
01:15:08.791 --> 01:15:11.125 line:83%
And she...

1664
01:15:11.208 --> 01:15:14.166 line:83%
She took my hand and she put
three ten-pound notes in it.

1665
01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:17.833 line:83%
She kissed me.

1666
01:15:17.916 --> 01:15:20.791 line:83%
And she told me she was proud of me.

1667
01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:23.041 line:83%
Then she told me
to have the time of my life.

And eventually, your mum and your sister,

they will understand.

-Isn't it incredible?
-Yes, it is, Jim.

1730

[exhales] No, Jay,
she doesn't want me to be there.

1735

I haven't even done the party favours.

1736
01:18:39.541 --> 01:18:41.333 line:83%
Course she wants you to be there.

1737
01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:44.291 line:83%
You're her sister and her best friend.

1738
01:18:45.208 --> 01:18:46.833 line:83%
And don't worry about the party favours.

-I've sorted it.
-What have you done?

You'll see when you get there.

1741

Now can you go and get ready, please?

1742

I also know it'll be okay.

You and Charlie did a really
great job on these, Pia.

They're stunning.

1758

[Sam] Yeah.

You know he always wanted
to go with you to London.

1764
01:20:17.958 --> 01:20:19.833 line:83%
But his family needed him.

1765

He's never stopped thinking
about you, though.

1766

I didn't even know I was being filmed.

1814
01:22:48.791 --> 01:22:51.875 line:83%

"Nothing unique can be created

unless two people take part."

1816
01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:55.333 line:83%
It made me think of your dad and me.

01:22:55.416 --> 01:22:56.333 line:83%
Oh.

1818
01:22:56.416 --> 01:22:58.125 line:83%
I don't think we should have got married.

1819

You think?

1820
01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:02.583 line:83%
But on the other hand, your dad
and I made you and Sonal,

1821
01:23:02.666 --> 01:23:06.791 line:83%
our beautiful daughters
who bring us such joy,

1822

-I... I can't even...
-You should tell him that.

1823

Maybe.

Hey! Mum, come on,
we're having a nice moment.

1826
01:23:17.708 --> 01:23:19.875 line:83%
And, yes, I have been very lonely.

1827

Akshay has ignited my spirits...

1828
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.458 line:83%
-Yeah!
-..by making a raging fire

1829

in what had become a very chilly place.

1830
01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:31.041 line:83%
Okay, okay, Mum,
that's too much information.

1831
01:23:31.125 --> 01:23:33.125 line:83%
Point is, Akshay's attracted to me

1832
01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:35.166 line:83%
precisely because I go my own way.

1833
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:39.166 line:83%
Mum, exactly.
You deserve all the happiness.

1834
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.583 line:83%
And you? What do you deserve?

1838
01:23:49.875 --> 01:23:51.375 line:83%
Mum...

1839
01:23:52.583 --> 01:23:54.458 line:83%
I don't want to get married.

1840
01:23:55.083 --> 01:23:56.916 line:83%
-Have you not been listening?
-[yells] No!

1841
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.166 line:83%
What did I just say two seconds ago?

1842
01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:00.375 line:83%
You said, um...

1843
01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:01.625 line:83%
[sobs] Oh, my God!

1844
01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:04.000 line:83%
You said, uh, that marriage
isn't for everyone.

1845
01:24:04.083 --> 01:24:05.916 line:83%
-[gasps]
-Exactly right.

1846
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.041 line:83%
So take the jewellery,
invest it in your photography,

1847
01:24:09.125 --> 01:24:11.083 line:83%
and go and make a difference in the world.
