The Heart Desires

2
00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:58.001 line:82%
The heart desires!

3
00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:12.516 line:82%
The heart desires!

4
00:01:51.137 --> 00:01:55.850 line:82%
The heart desires!

5
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.010 line:82%
Yes?

6
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.980 line:82%
Bring him here tomorrow.

7
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.350 line:82%
Okay.

8
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.810 line:82%
Sorry.

9
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.110 line:82%
Mr. Sinha,
it's a case of liver cirrhosis.

10
00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.740 line:82%
The patient's liver is badly damaged.

11
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.360 line:82%
We've kept her under observation.

12
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.570 line:82%
It's hard to say more right now.

13
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.450 line:82%
But you can do something,
can't you?

14
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.160 line:82%
We are trying our best.

15
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.930 line:82%
The problem is,
we can't do a liver transplant

16
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.170 line:82%
on such a short notice.

17
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.550 line:82%
Anyway, I must get back
to the patient now.

18
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.930 line:82%
If you want to inform her relatives

19
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.350 line:82%
you may use my phone.

20
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.390 line:82%
Excuse me.

21
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.450 line:82%
- Hello?
- Sameer.

22
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.890 line:82%
Sid?

23
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.920 line:82%
Sid!

24
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.010 line:82%
Hey, how are you, buddy?
Where are you?

25
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.290 line:82%
I'm at the hospital.

26
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.130 line:82%
Hospital?
Are you okay?

27
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.800 line:82%
Yes, I'm alright.

28
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.460 line:82%
So, what's wrong?

29
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.800 line:82%
Just hold on. I'm coming.

30
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.120 line:82%
Listen, Akash is back in Mumbai.
I'll bring him along.

31
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.590 line:82%
He won't come.

32
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.780 line:82%
It's time to put the past behind us.

33
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.700 line:82%
He'll be very happy
to know you're here.

34
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.740 line:82%
Just take it easy.
We'll see you soon.

35
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.740 line:82%
Okay.

36
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.840 line:82%
Hello?

37
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.000 line:82%
Yes, Sameer.
What is it?

38
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.580 line:82%
Sameer, you better see him.
I don't want to come.

39
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.370 line:82%
You were right about what you had
said but,

40
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.950 line:82%
things are better now, as they are.

41
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.710 line:82%
I am living my life
and Sid is living his.

42
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.130 line:82%
You should go and see him. Okay?

43
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.700 line:82%
- Hello.
- Hello, Sameer,

44
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.450 line:82%
come home quickly. Now!

45
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.920 line:82%
Hello?

46
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.720 line:82%
Sid? Hello?

47
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.430 line:82%
Akash. Sameer. What's wrong?
What's the rush?

48
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.870 line:82%
What do you think?

49
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.110 line:82%
Are you mad,
calling at this hour of night?

50
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.340 line:82%
- I thought you'd been robbed.
- Beautiful!

51
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.870 line:82%
What's so beautiful in that Akash?

52
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.370 line:82%
Wow! That is beautiful.

53
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.050 line:82%
Darn good, man.

54
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.180 line:82%
But Sid, doesn't she remind you
of someone?

55
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.720 line:82%
Of whom?

56
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.290 line:82%
Sameer, what do you think?

57
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.660 line:82%
I think everyone looks like
someone else.

58
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.640 line:82%
But she looks like Ms. Kashyap.

59
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.400 line:82%
Our economics teacher?

60
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.860 line:82%
Yes, sir.
Our economics teacher.

61
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.610 line:82%
- No way...
- Not at all.

62
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.650 line:82%
Yes, buddy

63
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.860 line:82%
And I know Ms. Kashyap
better than you guys.

64
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.950 line:82%
Tuition.

65
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.870 line:82%
I used to go to her for tuition.

66
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.830 line:82%
Okay.

67
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.550 line:82%
Just the two of you
or were there other students?

68
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.810 line:82%
What do you think?

69
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.840 line:82%
Just the two of you?

70
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.540 line:82%
- Akash, you never told me.
- Yes, you're right.

71
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.180 line:82%
She does look like Ms. Kashyap.

72
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.850 line:82%
But guess what I've got wrong!

73
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.530 line:82%
Her figure!

74
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.930 line:82%
What do you know about that?

75
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.840 line:82%
I hate economics.

76
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.900 line:82%
Hey.

77
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.410 line:82%
- Hey.
- Darn you!

78
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.580 line:82%
Here you go.

79
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.210 line:82%
Akash, I say, don't...

80
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.940 line:82%
Here is some red!

81
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.430 line:82%
And some green!

82
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.180 line:82%
- And...
- Stop it!

83
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.530 line:82%
Excuse me.

84
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.080 line:82%
- I'm looking for Sid.
- Sid?

85
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.660 line:82%
I'm sorry. Sinha.
Siddharth Sinha.

86
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.950 line:82%
One moment.

87
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.210 line:82%
Sameer.

88
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.920 line:82%
It's good to see you, Sid.

89
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.550 line:82%
It's good to see you.

90
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.520 line:82%
- When did you return to Mumbai?
- This morning.

91
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.150 line:82%
Thank God. What would've
happened if I hadn't been there?

92
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.900 line:82%
How's she now?

93
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.780 line:82%
I don't know. It's too early
to say anything.

94
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.660 line:82%
Anyway...

95
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.870 line:82%
What've you been up to?

96
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.750 line:82%
I'm helping Dad
with his computer business.

97
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.210 line:82%
Otherwise, everything's the same.
It's good.

98
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.050 line:82%
In fact, great.

99
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.220 line:82%
And you? Still at your uncle's
farmhouse in Pune?

100
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.750 line:82%
Yes, it's a nice place.
Come there some time.

101
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.250 line:82%
I certainly will.

102
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.610 line:82%
Do you really mean it?

103
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.190 line:82%
I mean to do lots of things.

104
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.650 line:82%
I'm thinking of getting married.

105
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.330 line:82%
Thank you.

106
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.140 line:82%
I knew you'd be the first to get
married out of the three of us.

107
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.250 line:82%
Yes.

108
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.370 line:82%
What if I tell you Akash
is getting married too?

109
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:43.920 line:82%
What?

110
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.590 line:82%
- Is Akash getting married?
- Yes.

111
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.570 line:82%
I'm not kidding.

112
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.610 line:82%
No way!

113
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.520 line:82%
Hey, I'm serious.

114
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.160 line:82%
To whom? The girl who was
crazy about him in college?

115
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.090 line:82%
Don't you remember?
She used to call him in a strange way.

116
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.990 line:82%
Akash!

117
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.300 line:82%
- Oh God! Deepa is coming.
- Behave yourself.

118
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.960 line:82%
- Hi, guys. Hi, Akash.
- Hi, Deepa.

119
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.460 line:82%
Bye, Deepa.

120
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.000 line:82%
Akash, let's dance.

121
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.050 line:82%
Look at those couples.
We'll make them jealous.

122
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.050 line:82%
Go ahead.
I'll be right there.

123
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.050 line:82%
- Really?
- Promise.

124
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.930 line:82%
Okay. Bye, guys.

125
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.430 line:82%
Yes, after three lifetimes.

126
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.420 line:82%
Sameer, baby, I'm thirsty.
Get me a drink.

127
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.180 line:82%
And dance with Deepa for me
while you're at it.

128
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.520 line:82%
- Hey, Sid.
- What?

129
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.980 line:82%
What are you drawing?

130
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.880 line:82%
So, you're Ravi's sister.
Okay, fine. How's he?

131
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.840 line:82%
Priya, isn't Sameer taking
a long time to get your drink?

132
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.130 line:82%
- Oh, there he is.
- Sounds nice.

133
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.060 line:82%
Bye.

134
00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.840 line:82%
Hi.

135
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.190 line:82%
What's happening?

136
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.940 line:82%
- Has someone died?
- Yes, you.

137
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.900 line:82%
Did I send you to get a drink,
or to chat with other girls?

138
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.450 line:82%
- What?
- I'm sure you have something with her!

139
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.480 line:82%
I remember when I was in Panchgani,

140
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.440 line:82%
I'd call but you were never home.

141
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.750 line:82%
Stop it, Akash!

142
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.530 line:82%
Priya, you're mistaken.

143
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.350 line:82%
Just tell me the truth, Sameer.
Tell me, how do you know her?

144
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.500 line:82%
Finished.

145
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.480 line:82%
Has someone died?

146
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.850 line:82%
- Who's she?
- I don't know.

147
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.940 line:82%
But you must've seen her somewhere.

148
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.890 line:82%
- Yes, I have.
- Where?

149
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.260 line:82%
She's sitting over there.

150
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.160 line:82%
Gosh...

151
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.160 line:82%
She's gorgeous.

152
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.500 line:82%
Priya, do you know her?

153
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.590 line:82%
Forget it.
She's not your type.

154
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.460 line:82%
Who cares?
I don't plan to marry her.

155
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.220 line:82%
Never mind if she isn't my type.

156
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.542 line:82%
May I ask what type of girls you like?

157
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.417 line:82%
Someone who lives her life
and lets me live mine.

158
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.220 line:82%
Someone who doesn't get too emotional.

159
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.270 line:82%
Yes, you once said you'd met
your type of girl.

160
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.302 line:82%
The affair lasted for two long weeks.

161
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.042 line:82%
Two weeks was too long.

162
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:32.390 line:82%
Anyway, I'm off. I'll miss her
if I waste time talking to you.

163
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.200 line:82%
Think it over.
I don't see her falling for you.

164
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.980 line:82%
Uncle Sam, my magic never fails!

165
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.417 line:82%
Hello, check.

166
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.125 line:82%
Check one, two, four.
One, two, four.

167
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.630 line:82%
Is the mike leaking?
Where did the three go?

168
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.334 line:82%
Good evening, friends!

169
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.930 line:82%
It's our graduation day.
An important day for us.

170
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.810 line:82%
I've decided...

171
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.520 line:82%
- to sing a song for all of you.
- Who's he?

172
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.834 line:82%
Now as we're about to enter
a new world,

173
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.790 line:82%
we'll be forced to prove
ourselves and be successful.

174
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.709 line:82%
This song is called
"A Hundred Ways to Get a Job."

175
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.420 line:82%
- What?
- What?

176
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.034 line:82%
Relax guys.
I was only kidding.

177
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.625 line:82%
Who cares where the hell
we land up!

178
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.760 line:82%
Hit it!

179
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.710 line:82%
If people say we're crazy,
who cares!

180
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:15.070 line:82%
If people say we're crazy,
who cares!

181
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.860 line:82%
This time belongs to us

182
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:29.830 line:82%
We have the music, we can sing.
Then why should we hold back?

183
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:36.930 line:82%
We have the music, we can sing.
Then why should we hold back?

184
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:43.490 line:82%
We'll sing the melody
that's in our hearts

185
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.125 line:82%
- If the world gets angry...
- Let it

186
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.834 line:82%
- If the world quarrels...
- Let it

187
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.750 line:82%
- If the world fights.
- Let it

188
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.584 line:82%
We'll sing as we please

189
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.334 line:82%
- If people sulk...
- Let them

190
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.250 line:82%
- If ties are broken...
- Let them break

191
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.959 line:82%
- If someone leaves...
- Let them go

192
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.834 line:82%
Never be scared!

193
00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:05.200 line:82%
We're modern,
why should our style be old?

194
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:12.540 line:82%
We are modern,
why should our style be old?

195
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:35.220 line:82%
There's lightning in our eyes,
a storm in our breath

196
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:42.700 line:82%
What is fear? What is defeat?
We don't know what they mean

197
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.960 line:82%
The Earth and sky were created for us

198
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:57.260 line:82%
I know we can pluck the stars
from the sky

199
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:04.050 line:82%
Sure we can.
We live beyond the sky

200
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:11.270 line:82%
We're modern,
why should our style be old?

201
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:48.140 line:82%
You know the land of dreams,
we were raised there

202
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:55.560 line:82%
We're carefree lovers who
live our whims and fancies

203
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:02.740 line:82%
Mesmerizing everyone with
our magic wherever we go

204
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:10.100 line:82%
Teaching beauties the art of love

205
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:16.420 line:82%
We know how to steal a woman's
heart and sleep

206
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:24.050 line:82%
We're modern,
why should our style be old?

207
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:31.890 line:82%
If people say we're crazy,
who cares!

208
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:39.270 line:82%
If people say we're crazy,
who cares!

209
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:45.530 line:82%
This time belongs to us.

210
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:53.790 line:82%
We have the music, we can sing.
Then why should we hold back?

211
00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:01.000 line:82%
We have the music, we can sing.
Then why should we hold back?

212
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.800 line:82%
We'll sing the melody
that's in our hearts

213
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.959 line:82%
- If the world gets angry.
- Let it

214
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.792 line:82%
- If the world quarrels.
- Let it

215
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.500 line:82%
- If the world fights...
- Let it

216
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.417 line:82%
We'll sing as we please

217
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.209 line:82%
- If people sulk...
- Let them sulk

218
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.042 line:82%
- If ties are broken...
- Let them break

219
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.792 line:82%
If someone leaves...
- Let them go

220
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.542 line:82%
Never be scared

221
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:29.530 line:82%
We're modern,
why should our style be old?

222
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:36.700 line:82%
We're modern,
why should our style be old?

223
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:43.880 line:82%
We're modern,
why should our style be old?

224
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:52.010 line:82%
We're modern,
why should our style be old?

225
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.792 line:82%
You didn't tell us,
but we know all about you.

226
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.584 line:82%
I met Rohit...

227
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.670 line:82%
- Hi.
- Hi.

228
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.010 line:82%
- No, actually...
- Akash Malhotra.

229
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.350 line:82%
- Shalini.
- Shalini? A lovely name.

230
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.709 line:82%
Thanks.

231
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.730 line:82%
I haven't seen you before.
You're not from our college.

232
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.709 line:82%
You are right.
I'm here with somebody.

233
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.440 line:82%
Would you care to dance with me?

234
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.584 line:82%
I'm sorry.
The fact is that Rohit and I...

235
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.667 line:82%
Rohit? I see,
you are Rohit's sister?

236
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.000 line:82%
- No, actually I...
- Don't be silly.

237
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.167 line:82%
Rohit and I are close friends.

238
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.417 line:82%
In fact, he's like a brother to me.

239
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.750 line:82%
Just one dance.

240
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.420 line:82%
I'm really sorry.
I can't.

241
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:15.417 line:82%
Not even if I told you
that I love you?

242
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.720 line:82%
Excuse me!

243
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.917 line:82%
Yes, Shalini.
I love you and only you.

244
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.542 line:82%
My every breath,

245
00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:28.270 line:82%
every heartbeat is filled
with you, Shalini.

246
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.769 line:82%
I'm sure I was born to love you.

247
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.334 line:82%
And you were born to be mine.

248
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.040 line:82%
You are mine, Shalini,
and if you ask your heart,

249
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.580 line:82%
you'll realize I'm speaking the truth.

250
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.460 line:82%
- Wow!
- Bravo!

251
00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.800 line:82%
Hey...

252
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.470 line:82%
Excuse me. Who are you?

253
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.770 line:82%
Don't you recognize your brother, Rohit?

254
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.940 line:82%
You're Rohit?
I mean, you're Rohit, too?

255
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.500 line:82%
I'm so sorry!

256
00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.970 line:82%
I thought Shalini was
another Rohit's sister.

257
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.320 line:82%
Look at him. He's over there.

258
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.660 line:82%
- Hi, Sameer.
- Hey, Rohit.

259
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.910 line:82%
Sameer? Your name's Sameer?

260
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.770 line:82%
So, you've been lying to me
all these days? That's not good.

261
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.167 line:82%
Well...

262
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.625 line:82%
I don't know what to say.
You can see for yourself.

263
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.180 line:82%
He has been lying to me
that he's Rohit.

264
00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.270 line:82%
He is not Rohit,
and Shalini is not my sister.

265
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.190 line:82%
Shalini is my fiancee.

266
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.650 line:82%
Fiancee?

267
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.280 line:82%
You know, Sameer, I don't like
you being friends with Akash.

268
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.370 line:82%
The way he behaved the other
night was so embarrassing.

269
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.460 line:82%
Let him go his way.
Just keep away from him.

270
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.584 line:82%
- But Akash is my friend, Priya.
- Come off it, Sameer.

271
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.010 line:82%
Have you no other friends besides Akash?

272
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.834 line:82%
- Of course, but...
- Just decide, Sameer.

273
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.430 line:82%
Either be friends with Akash or with me.

274
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.180 line:82%
Sameer?

275
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.042 line:82%
I'm thinking about it.

276
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.375 line:82%
You need time to think
if you want to be with me?

277
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.030 line:82%
How insensitive, Sameer!

278
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.390 line:82%
- So, you need some time?
- No, I mean...

279
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.084 line:82%
Don't be silly, Priya.

280
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.542 line:82%
I'm going out with my friends.
I'll be home by two.

281
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.390 line:82%
If I don't hear from you by
then, I'll know your answer.

282
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.380 line:82%
Priya.

283
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.420 line:82%
Aren't you taking this too seriously?

284
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.970 line:82%
No, I'm not that serious yet.

285
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.890 line:82%
But, if I do get serious,
then God help you!

286
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.375 line:82%
What are you doing?

287
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.870 line:82%
Your bruise has a funny color.

288
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.542 line:82%
Sid, have you had a look?

289
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.542 line:82%
Do you like it?
You want one, too?

290
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.000 line:82%
Hey!

291
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.460 line:82%
Don't vent it out on me.

292
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.584 line:82%
Did I ask you to talk to Shalini?

293
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.260 line:82%
No, but you could've helped me.

294
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:48.810 line:82%
Hey, you.

295
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.930 line:82%
You just sat there.
Some friend you are!

296
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.760 line:82%
Better to be friends with Rohit.
At least he'll protect me.

297
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.690 line:82%
God bless your friendship.
I'm leaving.

298
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.209 line:82%
- Where to?
- Home.

299
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.375 line:82%
Sit down. What's the hurry?
Right, Sameer?

300
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.540 line:82%
Yes, man, it's one in the afternoon.

301
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.480 line:82%
Which country are you in?
It's almost four!

302
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.600 line:82%
Oh, my God!

303
00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.890 line:82%
I forgot to call Priya.

304
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.730 line:82%
She's going to kill me.

305
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.709 line:82%
Why are you so scared of Priya?

306
00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.792 line:82%
I'm not scared of her.
I love her.

307
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.690 line:82%
I don't want to hurt her, or lose her.

308
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.790 line:82%
Sameer, I just don't understand
how you even tolerate her.

309
00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.070 line:82%
She's more of a boss than a girlfriend.

310
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.700 line:82%
Akash, I need help,
not your expert comments.

311
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.910 line:82%
What should I do now?

312
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.040 line:82%
What do you think?

313
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.060 line:82%
I'll tell you.
Call Priya and apologize.

314
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.810 line:82%
Say you'll never be friends with me again.

315
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.270 line:82%
Shut up, Akash.
You know I won't do that.

316
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.260 line:82%
What if she gets hurts
or you lose her? Christ!

317
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.490 line:82%
You'll never change, will you?

318
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.020 line:82%
Sameer, don't make a big deal out of it.

319
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.900 line:82%
Just relax. Relax.

320
00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.084 line:82%
Call her and talk to her.
It'll be fine.

321
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.834 line:82%
- Okay?
- Okay.

322
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920 line:82%
Okay.

323
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.750 line:82%
Hi, Priya.

324
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.375 line:82%
I was... but...

325
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.292 line:82%
Hear me out... but you...

326
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.440 line:82%
But... when...

327
00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.560 line:82%
I'm at Akash's. Hello...?

328
00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.430 line:82%
She hung up.

329
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.880 line:82%
Did you expect her to say
"Sorry, darling?"

330
00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:04.792 line:82%
What nonsense!

331
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.875 line:82%
There's a limit to everything, Sameer.

332
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.000 line:82%
Tell her these tantrums won't work.

333
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.917 line:82%
She'll have to do as you say
if she wants to be with you.

334
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.875 line:82%
She's challenged your self-respect.

335
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.260 line:82%
What are you doing? Be a man!

336
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:20.120 line:82%
Yeah?

337
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.720 line:82%
Yeah.

338
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.240 line:82%
Yeah!

339
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.625 line:82%
You're absolutely right, Akash.
That's what I'll do now.

340
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.290 line:82%
- That's like a man.
- See you later.

341
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.350 line:82%
- Bye, Sid.
- Just give it to her!

342
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.130 line:82%
He'll have it now.

343
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.370 line:82%
- Hello?
- Hello, Akash?

344
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.084 line:82%
- Priya?
- Yes.

345
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.875 line:82%
- Put Sameer on the phone.
- He hasn't been here.

346
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.500 line:82%
I haven't seen him
since last night.

347
00:29:53.584 --> 00:29:56.000 line:82%
What? He hasn't been there?
What the hell...

348
00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.040 line:82%
Watch it! You almost hit my other eye.

349
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.260 line:82%
- I want to talk to you.
- No need.

350
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.270 line:82%
I know what you have to say.

351
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.300 line:82%
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

352
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.880 line:82%
I called up Akash after talking to you.

353
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.584 line:82%
So?

354
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.810 line:82%
He said you weren't at his house.

355
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.584 line:82%
- What!
- Don't pretend, Sameer.

356
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.230 line:82%
I can't believe this. I never
knew you're such a big liar.

357
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.480 line:82%
But now, enough is enough!

358
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.900 line:82%
I don't want to see your face again.

359
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.490 line:82%
Go to hell!

360
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:06.970 line:82%
Excuse me.

361
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.650 line:82%
May I help you?

362
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.010 line:82%
No, it's okay. Thank you.

363
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.530 line:82%
No problem. It's not that far.

364
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.080 line:82%
No, it's okay. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

365
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.200 line:82%
Gosh!

366
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.250 line:82%
Shit!

367
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.180 line:82%
Shit!

368
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.070 line:82%
Thanks.

369
00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.375 line:82%
- God! What's in there?
- My things.

370
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.370 line:82%
No, wait. I'll hold here.

371
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.390 line:82%
Phew!

372
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.125 line:82%
That was just one suitcase
and we're already tired...

373
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.800 line:82%
Only two more.

374
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.190 line:82%
Only two? Let's go.

375
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.920 line:82%
Oh!

376
00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.760 line:82%
A nice place.

377
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.600 line:82%
Thank you.

378
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.230 line:82%
It belongs to the company I work for.

379
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.040 line:82%
I'm an interior designer.
I'm Tara Jaiswal.

380
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.890 line:82%
- Siddharth Sinha.
- Hi.

381
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.530 line:82%
Sid.

382
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:25.620 line:82%
What do you do?

383
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.330 line:82%
On Sundays I work as a porter.

384
00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.000 line:82%
And what about the weekdays?

385
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.630 line:82%
When people ask I say the first
thing that comes to my mind.

386
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.370 line:82%
But I'll tell you the truth as
I think it might interest you.

387
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.875 line:82%
What do you mean?

388
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.720 line:82%
You have three paintings among
your things. That's what I do.

389
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.300 line:82%
I'm a painter.

390
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.417 line:82%
- Really?
- Yes.

391
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.980 line:82%
How exciting!

392
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.970 line:82%
May I see your paintings?

393
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:57.360 line:82%
Of course.

394
00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.190 line:82%
Where do you live?

395
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.190 line:82%
The last house down this road.

396
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.350 line:82%
You're welcome any time.

397
00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:10.240 line:82%
- Sid, I'm off to the office.
- Just a minute, Mom.

398
00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:15.360 line:82%
I'm also coming along.
You can drop me off at Sameer's.

399
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.174 line:82%
Listen, it's Anju's wedding
anniversary today.

400
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.199 line:82%
She'll be upset if you don't come.

401
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.500 line:82%
- Hello.
- Hello.

402
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:33.020 line:82%
- Is Siddharth at home?
- Yes.

403
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:36.050 line:82%
- You are...?
- I'm Tara.

404
00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.780 line:82%
Hi. Please come in.

405
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.334 line:82%
Mom, this is Tara.

406
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.050 line:82%
- Hi.
- Hi.

407
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.542 line:82%
So, shall I go?

408
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.875 line:82%
Yes, I'll go later.

409
00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.209 line:82%
Fine. But you'll come
this evening, won't you?

410
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.000 line:82%
- Where?
- To Anju's.

411
00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.930 line:82%
It's boring there.

412
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.430 line:82%
There are very few places
that you don't find boring.

413
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.420 line:82%
Fine. Don't come.

414
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.690 line:82%
- Bye.
- Bye.

415
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.350 line:82%
Please sit down.

416
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.680 line:82%
I'd like to see your paintings first.

417
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:54.890 line:82%
The same thing again.

418
00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.560 line:82%
What thing?

419
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.650 line:82%
I've learned something about you today.

420
00:36:05.375 --> 00:36:09.750 line:82%
Something I didn't see when we first met.

421
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.080 line:82%
What's that?

422
00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.330 line:82%
You meet people and interact with them.

423
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.360 line:82%
But there's a world within you

424
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.710 line:82%
which is made of your dreams
and fantasies.

425
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.560 line:82%
You don't share them with anyone.

426
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.400 line:82%
I wonder if those who claim to know you

427
00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.520 line:82%
really know you at all.

428
00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:47.960 line:82%
What makes you say that?

429
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.420 line:82%
The door is closed.
No one can enter it.

430
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.500 line:82%
The box is shut.
No one can steal anything.

431
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:06.590 line:82%
Who can say what feelings
lie behind those eyelids?

432
00:37:08.287 --> 00:37:13.130 line:82%
I wonder what other things
your paintings hide.

433
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.400 line:82%
Perhaps like the way you do.

434
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.940 line:82%
What are you looking at?

435
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.910 line:82%
Which painting do you like the best?

436
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.490 line:82%
I haven't painted it yet.

437
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.640 line:82%
- Hey!
- Jesus!

438
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:11.830 line:82%
Akash.

439
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.970 line:82%
You scared the hell out of me, man.

440
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.790 line:82%
Your face is as white as the bed sheet.

441
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.649 line:82%
I'm very angry right now.

442
00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.660 line:82%
- All because of you.
- Why?

443
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.280 line:82%
Man, I saved your life
and you're angry with me?

444
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.570 line:82%
- Saved my life?
- Absolutely!

445
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.120 line:82%
It had to happen.

446
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.960 line:82%
Priya would've ditched you one day.

447
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.167 line:82%
You know why?

448
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.350 line:82%
She didn't love you,
but some other Sameer.

449
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.380 line:82%
He looked like you,
but he was someone else.

450
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.709 line:82%
You're not that Sameer.
You're our Sameer.

451
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.840 line:82%
Sid and I know you

452
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.090 line:82%
and Priya can only hope to know you.

453
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.850 line:82%
If you became Priya's Sameer,
our Sameer would be the loser.

454
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.550 line:82%
- I never thought of it that way.
- I know.

455
00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.439 line:82%
- I feel much better.
- Good.

456
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.417 line:82%
Then pack your bag and come with us.

457
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:02.250 line:82%
Sid and I are waiting for you in the car.

458
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:04.040 line:82%
- Where are we going?
- Goa.

459
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.600 line:82%
Goa?!

460
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.130 line:82%
The heart desires!

461
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.990 line:82%
The heart desires!

462
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.310 line:82%
The heart desires!

463
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.470 line:82%
May these sparkling days never end

464
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.650 line:82%
The heart desires!

465
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.690 line:82%
May we never part with friends

466
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.820 line:82%
May our days be full of lovely chats

467
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.410 line:82%
May our evenings dance,
and our nights sing

468
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:57.040 line:82%
May our lives always be exciting

469
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:07.260 line:82%
May every path we tread offer happiness

470
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:11.440 line:82%
The heart desires!

471
00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.730 line:82%
May these sparkling days never end

472
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.690 line:82%
The heart desires!

473
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.170 line:82%
May we never part with friends

474
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.760 line:82%
Our glittering paths are dazzling

475
00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.230 line:82%
May this joy and light be ours by right

476
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.980 line:82%
The heart desires!

477
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.500 line:82%
The heart desires!

478
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.220 line:82%
The heart desires!

479
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.400 line:82%
The heart desires!

480
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.090 line:82%
Oh shit!

481
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:46.690 line:82%
See you.

482
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.980 line:82%
Hi, guys!
What a surprise!

483
00:41:49.042 --> 00:41:50.400 line:82%
- Deepa!
- Oh! Hi, Deepa.

484
00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.880 line:82%
Where's Akash?

485
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.000 line:82%
Behind the plant.

486
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.830 line:82%
- Hi, Akash.
- Hi, Deepa. Hi.

487
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.930 line:82%
- Are you staying at this hotel?
- We were.

488
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.530 line:82%
We're checking out.

489
00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.125 line:82%
- Oh! How sad.
- I know. Very sad.

490
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.584 line:82%
- We'll miss you.
- Yes.

491
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:11.340 line:82%
We've been here a week, haven't we?

492
00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.042 line:82%
- Right, guys?
- Well...

493
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.920 line:82%
- Yes, we've been here for a week.
- Yes.

494
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.050 line:82%
- But Akash just got here.
- Yes, I just got here.

495
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.960 line:82%
Akash, you never stop joking.

496
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.540 line:82%
That's right.

497
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.190 line:82%
- So, Deepa.
- Yes?

498
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.070 line:82%
What's your room number?

499
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.070 line:82%
Sid, look over there.

500
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.810 line:82%
Sameer is at it!

501
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.270 line:82%
Akash!

502
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:54.834 line:82%
- Sid.
- What?

503
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.417 line:82%
- Did you hear that?
- Akash!

504
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:57.930 line:82%
Someone's calling my name.

505
00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.940 line:82%
No.

506
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.030 line:82%
Who's calling? Hey!

507
00:44:03.234 --> 00:44:05.887 line:82%
- Hi, Akash. Hi!

508
00:44:05.966 --> 00:44:07.667 line:82%
- Go faster!

509
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.160 line:82%
Go faster, buddy!

510
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.875 line:82%
- This is the top speed.
- Don't tell me!

511
00:44:13.959 --> 00:44:15.960 line:82%
Hey, guys! Akash.

512
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.870 line:82%
Faster, Sid. Faster.

513
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.620 line:82%
Akash!

514
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:52.820 line:82%
What a beautiful place!

515
00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.840 line:82%
Yes, it's beautiful.

516
00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.620 line:82%
You know what?

517
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.050 line:82%
We should spend a week in Goa every year.

518
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.430 line:82%
Definitely.

519
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:08.330 line:82%
- Isn't it, Sid? - Yes.

520
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:13.750 line:82%
What are you thinking about?

521
00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.910 line:82%
I'm looking at that ship.

522
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.650 line:82%
It'll soon vanish over the horizon.

523
00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.680 line:82%
We three are like that ship.

524
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:28.280 line:82%
We'll soon set sail for our destinations.

525
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.620 line:82%
And we may have different goals.

526
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.710 line:82%
I don't understand
why you're saying all this.

527
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.220 line:82%
We're friends, Sid.

528
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:49.720 line:82%
- For life.
- Of course, we are.

529
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.520 line:82%
But who knows where life will take us?

530
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.600 line:82%
Forget spending a week in Goa every year.

531
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.360 line:82%
We may not even come here
once in ten years.

532
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.880 line:82%
That won't be the case, Sid.

533
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.810 line:82%
We were, are and will remain friends
for life...

534
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.910 line:82%
forever.

535
00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:16.810 line:82%
Definitely.

536
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:19.270 line:82%
Shall we go?

537
00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.730 line:82%
Deepa must be waiting for you.

538
00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.770 line:82%
Don't say she must be.
She is waiting.

539
00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.570 line:82%
I've informed her that you'll see her
exactly at 8 PM, near the poolside.

540
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.375 line:82%
- Sameer, you're a dog.
- Buddy.

541
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.000 line:82%
- I'm going to kill you.
- You like her, don't you?

542
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.250 line:82%
- I'm going to kill you!
- No!

543
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:42.042 line:82%
How strange is this journey

544
00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.650 line:82%
Each of us is so unsure
where he is destined to go

545
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:51.292 line:82%
Each of us is so unsure
where he is destined to go

546
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:56.080 line:82%
Who knows what the future
has in store for us?

547
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.090 line:82%
The heart desires

548
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:21.350 line:82%
May these sparkling days never end

549
00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.100 line:82%
The heart desires

550
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:30.630 line:82%
May we never part with friends

551
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.770 line:82%
May our days be full of lovely chats

552
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:42.630 line:82%
May our evenings dance,
and our nights sing

553
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:48.900 line:82%
May our lives always be exciting

554
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:59.160 line:82%
May every path we tread offer happiness

555
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:05.250 line:82%
Our glittering paths are dazzling

556
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.830 line:82%
May this joy and light be ours by right

557
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:14.550 line:82%
Our glittering paths are dazzling

558
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.040 line:82%
May this joy and light be ours by right

559
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.640 line:82%
The heart desires

560
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.180 line:82%
The heart desires

561
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:30.860 line:82%
The heart desires

562
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.410 line:82%
The heart desires

563
00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:39.990 line:82%
The heart desires

564
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.750 line:82%
May I?

565
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:13.560 line:82%
Deepa.

566
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.250 line:82%
- Why do you like Akash so much?
- What do you mean?

567
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.400 line:82%
Sometimes I wonder why we like someone.

568
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.240 line:82%
Why do you like him?

569
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.620 line:82%
I don't know. I just do.

570
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:40.850 line:82%
- Though you know that he...
- That he doesn't love me?

571
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.970 line:82%
Yes, even then.

572
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.600 line:82%
Deepa, you're pretty, intelligent.

573
00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.740 line:82%
You can get anyone.

574
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.040 line:82%
If that's true, why can't I get Akash?

575
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:07.740 line:82%
I don't know why.

576
00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.740 line:82%
But I know if you ever need Akash's help,

577
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:16.340 line:82%
he'll do all he can for you.

578
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.710 line:82%
But you shouldn't hope for things that...

579
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:31.550 line:82%
See this sand?

580
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.100 line:82%
The tighter you hold it

581
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.250 line:82%
the quicker it slips through your fingers.

582
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.880 line:82%
Thanks, Sid.

583
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.084 line:82%
Where's your bag?
Have you donated it to the hotel?

584
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.440 line:82%
Actually... I've decided
to stay for a few days more.

585
00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.860 line:82%
- What?
- Kristine wants me to stay.

586
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:26.600 line:82%
Kristine? That girl who...

587
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:29.570 line:82%
Sid, did you hear that?

588
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.860 line:82%
Our friend has decided to become a hippie.

589
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:33.780 line:82%
- Don't be silly.
- Akash, my dear.

590
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.810 line:82%
Thank you.

591
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:42.980 line:82%
If you hadn't brought me,
I'd never have met her.

592
00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:46.290 line:82%
She's from Switzerland.

593
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:52.500 line:82%
I'm considering moving there
and starting a honey bee farm.

594
00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:54.340 line:82%
- So I just...
- Shut up, Sameer!

595
00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.100 line:82%
I love her, guys.

596
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.440 line:82%
Sameer.

597
00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:08.610 line:82%
Let's go.

598
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.950 line:82%
What have I done?
He was better off with Priya.

599
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:24.610 line:82%
And listen. Please don't call
my home until I return.

600
00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:28.320 line:82%
- Sure.
- See you, man.

601
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:52.940 line:82%
So, did you have a great time in Goa?

602
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.070 line:82%
- Yes?
- Yes, we had lots of fun.

603
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:58.230 line:82%
Have you been there?

604
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:01.040 line:82%
Yes, many years ago.

605
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.320 line:82%
Whose photos are those?

606
00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.720 line:82%
Esha, my daughter.

607
00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.980 line:82%
Oh!

608
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:19.680 line:82%
I've never seen her. Where's she?

609
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:23.850 line:82%
Well, she lives with her father.

610
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:31.900 line:82%
April 9th, 1995.

611
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:34.620 line:82%
On my birthday,

612
00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.660 line:82%
my husband gave me this present.

613
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:41.910 line:82%
Divorce.

614
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.040 line:82%
Sorry to hear that.

615
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.660 line:82%
You do see your daughter, don't you?

616
00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.780 line:82%
No.

617
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.100 line:82%
The court doesn't allow me
to see my own daughter.

618
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.600 line:82%
Why?

619
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.200 line:82%
My ex-husband is a very rich man.

620
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.060 line:82%
His lawyers were smart.

621
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:17.560 line:82%
With the help of many witnesses, he proved

622
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.370 line:82%
that I'm not a good mother.

623
00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:24.620 line:82%
I'm an alcoholic.

624
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.920 line:82%
An irresponsible woman who drinks.

625
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:32.630 line:82%
That's ridiculous.

626
00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.420 line:82%
You're nothing of the sort.

627
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:39.880 line:82%
If only you were the judge!

628
00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.700 line:82%
Tell me, what else did you do there?

629
00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.042 line:82%
I'd like to paint your portrait.

630
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.950 line:82%
So you want to paint my portrait?

631
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:02.990 line:82%
Please.

632
00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:07.150 line:82%
Okay.

633
00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.410 line:82%
Okay. I'll be back.

634
00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.667 line:82%
Are you going out?

635
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.260 line:82%
Sorry, I have to go.

636
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.060 line:82%
They called me from the site.
There's a problem.

637
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:06.030 line:82%
Okay.

638
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.850 line:82%
Sorry, Sid.

639
00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:41.220 line:82%
Alright. Out with it!

640
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.090 line:82%
Have you thought about your future plans?

641
00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.220 line:82%
No.

642
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:51.680 line:82%
It's my fault.

643
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.690 line:82%
I've always thought I'd give
you time, you need more time.

644
00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.270 line:82%
My pampering has spoiled you.

645
00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:05.630 line:82%
At this rate, you'll barely sign
a check by the time I get old.

646
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.590 line:82%
Dad, there's more to life
than signing checks.

647
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.280 line:82%
I see.

648
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.030 line:82%
And what would that be?

649
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:19.040 line:82%
I haven't found out yet but you'll be
the first to know when I do.

650
00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.550 line:82%
Akash, enough of your jokes.

651
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.630 line:82%
I've decided to send you to Australia.

652
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:31.050 line:82%
Cool! Another holiday?

653
00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:33.250 line:82%
You'll manage our business there.

654
00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:36.820 line:82%
Mom, Dad's joking now.

655
00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:41.060 line:82%
No, he's serious.
You'd better get serious, too.

656
00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:43.860 line:82%
You are going to Sydney.

657
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.990 line:82%
You'll manage our office there.

658
00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:49.540 line:82%
That's all.

659
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.660 line:82%
But, Dad! Shit!

660
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.580 line:82%
Sorry.

661
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.870 line:82%
Sameer's mom on the line.

662
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:06.380 line:82%
Tell her I'm not here.

663
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.330 line:82%
- Akash says that...
- Hey.

664
00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:10.540 line:82%
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, Akash.

665
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.030 line:82%
- Yes, ma'am?
- What's wrong with Sameer?

666
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.590 line:82%
- Nothing. Sameer is fine.
- Not really!

667
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:20.450 line:82%
He's shut himself in his room.
He doesn't eat or even come out.

668
00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:22.780 line:82%
- Is he in Mumbai?
- Of course.

669
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:24.590 line:82%
Didn't you all return last night?

670
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:27.060 line:82%
Yes, last night...

671
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:29.010 line:82%
- I'm so forgetful these days.
- Akash.

672
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.970 line:82%
Are you and Sameer on drugs?

673
00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:32.770 line:82%
Of course not, ma'am.

674
00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:36.220 line:82%
Don't worry, I'll come over right away.
Okay? Bye.

675
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:40.030 line:82%
Phew! Sameer!

676
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:48.060 line:82%
Why didn't you call? How'd we
know what to tell your mother?

677
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:01.910 line:82%
What's the matter?

678
00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.310 line:82%
I'm in no mood to talk.

679
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.290 line:82%
Forget it. How's Kristine?

680
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:13.010 line:82%
Don't talk about her!

681
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.700 line:82%
Why? What happened?

682
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:21.320 line:82%
Go on.

683
00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.960 line:82%
Why don't you just say it?

684
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:27.030 line:82%
It's harmful to repress such things.

685
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.060 line:82%
Well...

686
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:36.080 line:82%
After you left two days ago,

687
00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:39.430 line:82%
I went to the beach to Kristine.

688
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:42.730 line:82%
It was great.

689
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:47.000 line:82%
It felt so good.
Just me and Kristine.

690
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.840 line:82%
- Yes?
- See this.

691
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:50.740 line:82%
How much is this?

692
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:54.140 line:82%
Kristine. I loved her so much.

693
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:57.780 line:82%
I was so happy!

694
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.710 line:82%
That evening she came back
to the hotel with me.

695
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:33.010 line:82%
I invited her in.

696
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.770 line:82%
I would never have imagined what happened
next.

697
01:00:58.090 --> 01:00:59.140 line:82%
Hi!

698
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:26.900 line:82%
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God! She was a crook!

699
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.260 line:82%
I really doubt she was from Switzerland.

700
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.990 line:82%
Laugh it up!

701
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:38.590 line:82%
The truck driver who gave me a lift back
was more sympathetic.

702
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:40.410 line:82%
You came back in a truck?

703
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:42.910 line:82%
Do I always sit on a pillow?

704
01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.820 line:82%
What, the 12 hour truck ride
has numbed my back!

705
01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.620 line:82%
Mom, this is Mr. Shankaran.
He works for Art India magazine.

706
01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:29.960 line:82%
- Hello.
- Hello.

707
01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:34.580 line:82%
Mrs. Sinha, I think that
Siddharth is very talented.

708
01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:38.200 line:82%
I told him about a friend
staying in Kasauli

709
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:41.210 line:82%
who holds an annual
painting workshop there.

710
01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.470 line:82%
- Do you think he should go there?
- Absolutely.

711
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:46.970 line:82%
It'll be a very good experience for him.

712
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:49.370 line:82%
Of course.
Thank you very much.

713
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.820 line:82%
- Hi.
- Oh, it's you!

714
01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.180 line:82%
You're a strange boy.

715
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.910 line:82%
You invite me and then
you're surprised to see me.

716
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.240 line:82%
- Mom, this is Tara...
- Tara Jaiswal.

717
01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:07.070 line:82%
You've introduced us before.

718
01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.120 line:82%
- Hello.
- Hello.

719
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.930 line:82%
Sameer, my dear.

720
01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.270 line:82%
How long will you mourn over Kristine?

721
01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.060 line:82%
Let me introduce you
to these sweet girls.

722
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.940 line:82%
- Let's go.
- Forget it. I'm not in the mood.

723
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.740 line:82%
- Are you feeling alright?
- I am alright, Akash.

724
01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:46.970 line:82%
I see.

725
01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:50.260 line:82%
Look! That's Christine!

726
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.050 line:82%
- Excellent work.
- Thank you.

727
01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.430 line:82%
- Hello.
- Hi.

728
01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.100 line:82%
- Do you like it?
- Thanks.

729
01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.520 line:82%
I like them all.

730
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:19.820 line:82%
It's difficult to say which is your best.

731
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.240 line:82%
I haven't painted my best yet.

732
01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.530 line:82%
- Why not?
- You don't have the time.

733
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.840 line:82%
How can I refuse on such
an important day in your life?

734
01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:39.800 line:82%
So, tell me. When do we start?

735
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.340 line:82%
- Tomorrow.
- Okay.

736
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:53.350 line:82%
- Sid.
- Yes?

737
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.650 line:82%
- I'll be right out.
- No problem. Take your time.

738
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:24.030 line:82%
What season is this in which

739
01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:28.090 line:82%
the heart blossoms like a flower?

740
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:39.180 line:82%
What season is this in which

741
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:42.980 line:82%
the heart blossoms like a flower?

742
01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:46.735 line:82%
All colors come alive
and all fragrances blend

743
01:05:46.816 --> 01:05:50.440 line:82%
All colors come alive
and all fragrances blend

744
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.280 line:82%
Moonlight, brooks and clouds.
Songs, rain and butterflies

745
01:05:54.361 --> 01:05:58.060 line:82%
Moonlight, brooks and clouds.
Songs, rain and butterflies

746
01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.670 line:82%
now bestow favors on us

747
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:13.180 line:82%
What season is this in which

748
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.980 line:82%
the heart blossoms like a flower?

749
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:30.060 line:82%
Look! At the bank of a river

750
01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:37.490 line:82%
a bird calls to another bird

751
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:45.240 line:82%
Look at this river

752
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:52.590 line:82%
She flows to unite with the sea

753
01:06:54.350 --> 01:07:00.700 line:82%
These journeys are all parts
of the caravan of love

754
01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.190 line:82%
What season is this in which

755
01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:09.980 line:82%
the heart blossoms like a flower?

756
01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:53.360 line:82%
How can I tell anyone?

757
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.780 line:82%
How can I explain

758
01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:00.730 line:82%
what love is?

759
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:08.540 line:82%
Love has no attachments

760
01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:15.760 line:82%
Love has no barriers

761
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:23.710 line:82%
Listen to the extraordinary
saga of love

762
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:29.439 line:82%
What season is this in which

763
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:33.189 line:82%
the heart blossoms like a flower?

764
01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:36.945 line:82%
All colors come alive,
and all fragrances blend

765
01:08:37.015 --> 01:08:40.630 line:82%
All colors come alive,
and all fragrances blend

766
01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:44.404 line:82%
Moonlight, brooks and clouds.
Songs, rain and butterflies

767
01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:48.300 line:82%
Moonlight, brooks and clouds.
Songs, rains, and butterflies

768
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:54.260 line:82%
now bestow favors on us

769
01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:59.590 line:82%
What season is this in which

770
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.430 line:82%
the heart blossoms like a flower?

771
01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:46.149 line:82%
Sameer.

772
01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:49.189 line:82%
Hello, ma'am.

773
01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.850 line:82%
- Hi, Mr. Naresh.
- Hey.

774
01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:52.580 line:82%
- How are you, Sameer?
- Very well. Thank you.

775
01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.330 line:82%
Sameer, are you going out?

776
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:56.240 line:82%
To Akash's. Why?

777
01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:01.490 line:82%
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

778
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.750 line:82%
What? You've got a proposal for me?

779
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.770 line:82%
Mom, I'm not open
to an arranged marriage.

780
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:32.970 line:82%
Why not? Even my marriage
to your dad was arranged.

781
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:35.440 line:82%
Please listen to me.

782
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.890 line:82%
We are not forcing you to get married.

783
01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.000 line:82%
We've known their family for years now.

784
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.260 line:82%
We'd like to turn our
friendship into something more.

785
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:43.390 line:82%
That's all.

786
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.260 line:82%
Can't you at least meet Pooja?

787
01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:49.810 line:82%
Okay.

788
01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.690 line:82%
But you know my answer,
and that's a "no."

789
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:58.030 line:82%
- May I come in?
- What?

790
01:10:58.530 --> 01:10:59.930 line:82%
Who is it, Sameer?

791
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.300 line:82%
- I'm Pooja.
- Of course.

792
01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.000 line:82%
Please come in.

793
01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:14.810 line:82%
Mom, Dad, this is Pooja.

794
01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:18.380 line:82%
Pooja, this is my mom, my dad...

795
01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.710 line:82%
and your mom and your dad!

796
01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:24.840 line:82%
Sameer, we have something
important to discuss.

797
01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.140 line:82%
Why don't Pooja and you sit in your room?

798
01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.190 line:82%
- Is that fine, Mr. Naresh?
- Yes, of course.

799
01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.850 line:82%
Anyway, you'll get bored
sitting with us oldies.

800
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.520 line:82%
This way.

801
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.120 line:82%
- Interesting room.
- Thanks.

802
01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.340 line:82%
- Are they your friends?
- Please sit.

803
01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:07.390 line:82%
Yes. This is Akash and this is Sid.

804
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:10.170 line:82%
Looks like a deep friendship.

805
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.140 line:82%
Either our friendship is deep
or this photo is 3D.

806
01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.690 line:82%
Sorry, it's a really bad joke.

807
01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080 line:82%
Pooja.

808
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.910 line:82%
I hope you know why you are here.

809
01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:39.420 line:82%
Yes, Mom and Dad told me about it.

810
01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:40.790 line:82%
Okay.

811
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.930 line:82%
Well, to tell you the truth,

812
01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:47.250 line:82%
when Mom told me about our marriage,

813
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.930 line:82%
I didn't like it at all.

814
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.170 line:82%
- But now I think...
- I'm so happy

815
01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.970 line:82%
that you're also against this
arranged marriage nonsense.

816
01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.880 line:82%
Oh, that's such a relief!

817
01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:02.230 line:82%
People shouldn't get married like this.

818
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:05.230 line:82%
One should only marry
the person one loves.

819
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.720 line:82%
- What do you think?
- Yes, you're absolutely right.

820
01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.060 line:82%
Are you in love with someone?

821
01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.310 line:82%
I'm so sorry.
That's none of my business.

822
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.590 line:82%
- It's okay.
- But I'm sorry.

823
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:21.080 line:82%
It's okay.

824
01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.510 line:82%
There's this guy in my life.

825
01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.800 line:82%
But I don't love him enough
to marry him yet, you know.

826
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:32.770 line:82%
- Even I think so...
- What?

827
01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:35.890 line:82%
- No, I'm not talking about your guy.
- Oh!

828
01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:45.400 line:82%
- What happened then?
- What else? She went home.

829
01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.680 line:82%
There's a problem.

830
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.740 line:82%
Sameer.

831
01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:58.730 line:82%
No.

832
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.030 line:82%
Now please don't tell me
that you've fallen for her.

833
01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:04.970 line:82%
Sameer.

834
01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:09.380 line:82%
Sameer, I'm sure you've
fallen in love with her.

835
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:13.010 line:82%
But I'm sure you'll fall in love with
another girl in three months.

836
01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.390 line:82%
No, Akash. This time I'm serious.

837
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.450 line:82%
I thought I always knew what love is.

838
01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:23.830 line:82%
- Today I see how wrong I was.
- Do you?

839
01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:29.250 line:82%
Akash, when I was talking
to Pooja today, I realized

840
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:33.320 line:82%
that I liked the girls I was attracted to

841
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:35.360 line:82%
but I mistook it for love.

842
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:39.560 line:82%
And now you're in love with Pooja?

843
01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:42.430 line:82%
Yes, that's the problem.

844
01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:44.290 line:82%
I'm in love with Pooja!

845
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.780 line:82%
Then you should tell her.

846
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:52.720 line:82%
Take my advice.
Say nothing to anyone.

847
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:54.040 line:82%
You can't be trusted.

848
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:56.780 line:82%
Today, it's Pooja, tomorrow
it'll be someone else.

849
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:03.900 line:82%
Hi!

850
01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:07.300 line:82%
Happy birthday to you.

851
01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.290 line:82%
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thanks. Come in.

852
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.950 line:82%
How did you know today's my birthday?

853
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:17.700 line:82%
You told me once.

854
01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.830 line:82%
Esha called up.

855
01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.740 line:82%
She's coming to see me today.

856
01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:34.530 line:82%
- Is she?
- My daughter is coming here.

857
01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.470 line:82%
Sid, she remembers my birthday.

858
01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:55.610 line:82%
I'll be seeing her after five long years.

859
01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.740 line:82%
I cooked the food myself,
and baked the cake.

860
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.360 line:82%
I'm very happy today.

861
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:06.270 line:82%
Is your husband also coming with Esha?

862
01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.890 line:82%
No.

863
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:11.840 line:82%
She told him she's going
to a friend's birthday party.

864
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:15.880 line:82%
Ajay would never let her come here.

865
01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.440 line:82%
Would you like to meet her?

866
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:24.890 line:82%
I'll be glad if you do.

867
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:32.250 line:82%
Hello?

868
01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.510 line:82%
You're teaching my daughter
to lie. Aren't you ashamed?

869
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:37.900 line:82%
- Ajay?
- Yes.

870
01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:41.820 line:82%
Thankfully, I heard you talking
to Esha over the phone.

871
01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.200 line:82%
Why don't you stay away from her?

872
01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:46.360 line:82%
I'm her mother!

873
01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:50.080 line:82%
You were, but now Kiran is her mother.

874
01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.580 line:82%
It'd be lot better if you accept this.

875
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.990 line:82%
Don't try to see Esha again, Tara.

876
01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.540 line:82%
Or I'll have to take you
to court again.

877
01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.210 line:82%
Understand what I'm saying?

878
01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.290 line:82%
Just go to hell!

879
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:22.190 line:82%
Happy birthday to me!

880
01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:42.720 line:82%
How dare he!

881
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:46.850 line:82%
He tells me I'm not Esha's
mother, she's not my daughter.

882
01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:51.260 line:82%
I'm Esha's mother!
I am her mother!

883
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:53.970 line:82%
Do you understand?
I'm Esha's mother.

884
01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:00.690 line:82%
He married again.

885
01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:04.760 line:82%
He destroyed my dreams,
but I said nothing.

886
01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:08.570 line:82%
Because I had everything.

887
01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.600 line:82%
I had Esha.

888
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:15.570 line:82%
But now...

889
01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:19.880 line:82%
But now I have nothing.

890
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.340 line:82%
I have nothing at all.

891
01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:24.670 line:82%
I'm nothing.

892
01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.380 line:82%
Nothing at all!

893
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:32.370 line:82%
I'm nothing.

894
01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:36.530 line:82%
I am nothing...

895
01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:39.950 line:82%
I'm nothing...

896
01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:47.900 line:82%
I'm sorry about Esha.

897
01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:55.830 line:82%
You know,

898
01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.500 line:82%
crying doesn't suit you at all.

899
01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:03.080 line:82%
What else can I do?

900
01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:07.960 line:82%
You can come with me.

901
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:18.100 line:82%
Happy birthday to you!

902
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:21.380 line:82%
Happy birthday to you!

903
01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:28.060 line:82%
Happy birthday, dear Tara.
Happy birthday to you!

904
01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:31.300 line:82%
From old friends, and new

905
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.680 line:82%
From old friends, and new

906
01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:41.500 line:82%
May good luck go with you
and happiness too!

907
01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:53.970 line:82%
Sid...

908
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:55.630 line:82%
Thank you.

909
01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.810 line:82%
And thank you, you two.

910
01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.310 line:82%
You must be wondering where
Siddharth has brought you.

911
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.110 line:82%
No, we'd go anywhere to eat a cake.

912
01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:14.770 line:82%
Eeena mina dika

913
01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:16.900 line:82%
Wow! I love that song.

914
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:19.660 line:82%
- Will you dance with me?
- Eeena mina dika

915
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:21.930 line:82%
- Dance?
- Dia dama nika...

916
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.390 line:82%
Right here.
We got plenty of room. Come.

Eeena, Mina, Dika.

Good night!

929
01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:20.390 line:82%
Sid, you're home. Good night.

930
01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.230 line:82%
I love her.

931
01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:25.980 line:82%
What?

932
01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:27.980 line:82%
Yes.

933
01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.900 line:82%
I love her, Akash.

934
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:34.530 line:82%
You're joking, right?

935
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:40.990 line:82%
No, he's serious.

936
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:43.920 line:82%
Have you gone mad?

937
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:48.420 line:82%
Sid, listen...

938
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:55.460 line:82%
I'm no great expert on love,
but isn't this a bit too much?

939
01:21:58.190 --> 01:22:03.010 line:82%
- Because she's older than me?
- No, well, that too!

940
01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:07.140 line:82%
Hold on. Why are we
even discussing this nonsense?

941
01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:13.650 line:82%
Because I thought you two
would understand me.

942
01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.200 line:82%
Hey, Sid!

943
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:23.030 line:82%
Understand what?

944
01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:28.750 line:82%
You say you love a woman who's
fifteen years older than you.

945
01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:32.290 line:82%
She has a daughter.
She had a husband.

946
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.260 line:82%
You just said that she has
a drinking problem.

947
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:37.090 line:82%
- What are we supposed to understand?
- That...

948
01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.470 line:82%
That I love her despite all that.

949
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.720 line:82%
Sid, just give it a thought.

950
01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.690 line:82%
- This isn't love. It's madness.
- No.

951
01:22:45.650 --> 01:22:46.730 line:82%
This is love.

952
01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:52.040 line:82%
I don't expect her to be mine or marry me.

953
01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.020 line:82%
I don't hope for that.

954
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:57.480 line:82%
- Even if she doesn't love me, it's fine.
- Oh, I see.

955
01:22:59.070 --> 01:23:00.740 line:82%
Now I get it.

956
01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:05.030 line:82%
Remember, Sameer?
That's how it started for me too.

957
01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:09.260 line:82%
- What do you mean?
- Of course.

958
01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:13.380 line:82%
Sid, if that's how it is, I don't mind.

959
01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.750 line:82%
In fact she's perfect for you.

960
01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:20.340 line:82%
She's experienced, lives alone.
You see her every day too.

961
01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:24.430 line:82%
Sameer, learn from him.

962
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.030 line:82%
Sid, it's a perfect choice...

963
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.230 line:82%
What a perverted mind you have!

964
01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.530 line:82%
I'm telling you I love her
but you made a dirty joke out of it.

965
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:45.110 line:82%
Grow up, Akash.

966
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:49.370 line:82%
We don't have to agree on everything.

967
01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:54.360 line:82%
But there's a line in friendship
that mustn't be crossed, but you did.

968
01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:58.630 line:82%
And you know what, Akash?

969
01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:04.130 line:82%
At some point in life
we all experience true love.

970
01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.890 line:82%
Then all these things, like age,

971
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.330 line:82%
do not matter.
They all seem trivial.

972
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:20.980 line:82%
I pity you, Akash. You won't
understand all this today.

973
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.110 line:82%
But one day you'll realize
that love cannot be planned.

974
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:29.990 line:82%
It just happens.

975
01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:37.730 line:82%
Are you finished?

976
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:40.900 line:82%
Yes.

977
01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.910 line:82%
Sameer, are you coming?

978
01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.470 line:82%
I still remember that night.

979
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.350 line:82%
I...

980
01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:52.020 line:82%
I was shocked.

981
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:56.810 line:82%
I never thought things would go that far.

982
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.490 line:82%
I couldn't sleep that night.

983
01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:07.320 line:82%
Next morning, I went to see Akash.

984
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:22.710 line:82%
I dream of rain

985
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.050 line:82%
I dream of gardens
in the desert sand

986
01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:29.140 line:82%
I wake in pain

987
01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:42.860 line:82%
Are you okay?

988
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.020 line:82%
These things happen between friends.

989
01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:53.040 line:82%
Let's go and meet Sid.
He must be disturbed, too.

990
01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.240 line:82%
You're sure to run into him somewhere.

991
01:26:57.330 --> 01:27:00.290 line:82%
What will you do then?
Ignore him?

992
01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.220 line:82%
Akash, are you you listening to me?

993
01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.260 line:82%
You're coming to meet Sid.

994
01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:11.970 line:82%
- Come on.
- Leave me alone, Sameer!

995
01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:14.260 line:82%
Just get the hell out of here!

996
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:39.080 line:82%
Good morning, Mrs. Sinha.
I'd like to see Sid.

997
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:41.550 line:82%
- He's gone.
- Where?

998
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:44.430 line:82%
To Kasauli.
He got a call last evening

999
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.920 line:82%
and they said his application
was accepted and...

1000
01:27:50.490 --> 01:27:51.930 line:82%
What happened, Sameer?

1001
01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.060 line:82%
- Is everything alright?
- What?

1002
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:59.020 line:82%
Of course. I'll leave now.

1003
01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:00.690 line:82%
Bye, Mrs. Sinha.

1004
01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:09.530 line:82%
I didn't realize that things
would never be the same again.

1005
01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.820 line:82%
You went to Kasauli.

1006
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:14.810 line:82%
A week later Akash left for Australia.

1007
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:24.540 line:82%
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

1008
01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.750 line:82%
Take care of yourself.

1009
01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:31.150 line:82%
I hope you remember who
you're meeting at the Sydney airport?

1010
01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.680 line:82%
Mr. Mehta.
Relax, Dad. I remember.

1011
01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.390 line:82%
Good luck.

1012
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:43.270 line:82%
- I'll go now. I'll call you from there.
- Okay.

1013
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:48.600 line:82%
- I wanted to tell you something.
- What?

1014
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:52.450 line:82%
Just that I always

1015
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.870 line:82%
made fun of your romantic affairs.

1016
01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:02.580 line:82%
I never thought how you'd feel.

1017
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:08.000 line:82%
You know I was just kidding,
don't you?

1018
01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.260 line:82%
Of course.

1019
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:14.930 line:82%
Don't worry. You weren't
the only one who was kidding.

1020
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.460 line:82%
Remember Shalini?

1021
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:21.470 line:82%
I remember her as well as Rohit's punch.

1022
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:25.980 line:82%
- I knew she was Rohit's fiancee.
- What?

1023
01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.520 line:82%
- Why didn't you stop me then?
- Have a nice flight.

1024
01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.190 line:82%
You son of a gun!

1025
01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:51.250 line:82%
Hi.

1026
01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:57.340 line:82%
I said, "Hi."

1027
01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:00.180 line:82%
Hi.

1028
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:02.470 line:82%
Where are you going?

1029
01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.350 line:82%
This flight goes to Sydney.

1030
01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.960 line:82%
- But where are you going?
- Sydney.

1031
01:30:09.490 --> 01:30:12.060 line:82%
How strange! All three of us
are going to Sydney.

1032
01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.620 line:82%
- Three?
- Yes. You, me and this flight!

1033
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:21.590 line:82%
I hope you know you're crazy!

1034
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.450 line:82%
Thank you.

1035
01:30:24.130 --> 01:30:25.500 line:82%
Thanks.

1036
01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.930 line:82%
Well, listen...

1037
01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:33.420 line:82%
I'm really sorry about that night.

1038
01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.020 line:82%
I was just kidding.

1039
01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:39.050 line:82%
- It's okay.
- Really?

1040
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:41.680 line:82%
Good.

1041
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.510 line:82%
- So you...
- So you...

1042
01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:50.060 line:82%
- Go ahead.
- Why are you going to Sydney?

1043
01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.900 line:82%
Dad wants me to manage
his business there.

1044
01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:56.280 line:82%
Now let's see how long it lasts!

1045
01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:59.580 line:82%
- And you?
- My uncle lives there.

1046
01:30:59.870 --> 01:31:02.530 line:82%
My mother's brother.
I'm going to meet him.

1047
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.420 line:82%
He's not like Rohit, is he?

1048
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:07.540 line:82%
No, thanks.

1049
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:11.330 line:82%
- What does he do?
- He's a photographer.

1050
01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.290 line:82%
Have you been to Sydney before?

1051
01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.770 line:82%
Do you always ask so many questions?

1052
01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:18.980 line:82%
Yes.

1053
01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:20.840 line:82%
Have you been to Sydney before?

1054
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:22.260 line:82%
Yes.

1055
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:24.800 line:82%
Good. You can show me around.

1056
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:28.560 line:82%
Hold on. Don't you know
anyone else there?

1057
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:30.980 line:82%
There's Mr. Mehta.

1058
01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:34.490 line:82%
Do you think I'll enjoy
hanging out with him?

1059
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.780 line:82%
Please. Come on.

1060
01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:40.050 line:82%
I already said I'm sorry.

1061
01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:42.320 line:82%
Okay. But I'll have to ask my uncle.

1062
01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.770 line:82%
Yes, sure.
But I don't think he'll refuse.

1063
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:48.120 line:82%
Why?

1064
01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.000 line:82%
Because I have a present for him.

1065
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:57.680 line:82%
Tada!

1066
01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.220 line:82%
- Oh... please.
- Smile.

1067
01:32:14.490 --> 01:32:16.110 line:82%
Hey, Shalini!

1068
01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.290 line:82%
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

1069
01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:22.090 line:82%
Uncle Mahesh, how are you?

1070
01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.430 line:82%
I'm fine.
But stop calling me uncle.

1071
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:27.780 line:82%
You've grown up now.
We're almost the same age.

1072
01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.120 line:82%
Oh, Akash.

1073
01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:34.300 line:82%
Akash, Uncle Mahesh.
Uncle Mahesh, Akash.

1074
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:35.390 line:82%
I'm Mahesh.

1075
01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.800 line:82%
- Hi, Mahesh.
- Hi.

1076
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.160 line:82%
Let's go.

1077
01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.370 line:82%
- Are you in Sydney on a business trip?
- Yes.

1078
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:43.510 line:82%
Dad's packed me off here
to run our export business.

1079
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:45.420 line:82%
Export business sounds very boring, man.

1080
01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:46.790 line:82%
I agree.

1081
01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:49.280 line:82%
- I'd prefer something more adventurous.
- I see.

1082
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:51.170 line:82%
For instance wildlife photography.

1083
01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:53.100 line:82%
You like photography?

1084
01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:56.430 line:82%
Mom says the first word I uttered

1085
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.380 line:82%
wasn't "mom'"or "dad,"
but "camera."

1086
01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.760 line:82%
- Excuse me. Akash?
- Yes?

1087
01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.020 line:82%
- Steve.
- Steve?

1088
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:07.620 line:82%
Satyadev Mehta.
- Oh, Mr. Mehta!

1089
01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:08.910 line:82%
I'm so sorry. Hi.

1090
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:12.340 line:82%
I've arranged for a car.
I'll take your baggage.

1091
01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.040 line:82%
Sure.

1092
01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:17.070 line:82%
I'm going, Shalini. Bye, Mahesh.

1093
01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.350 line:82%
Bye, Akash.

1094
01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:22.820 line:82%
If you need anything in Sydney,
here's my card.

1095
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:26.170 line:82%
- Call me.
- Thank you. Bye.

1096
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:27.930 line:82%
- Bye.
- Bye.

1097
01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.520 line:82%
I hope you like it.

1098
01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.120 line:82%
It's beautiful.

1099
01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.480 line:82%
- Thank you.
- Well, I'll leave.

1100
01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.130 line:82%
You'd better get some rest.

1101
01:33:54.210 --> 01:33:56.640 line:82%
I'll send the driver
to pick you up tomorrow.

1102
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:58.380 line:82%
- Thank you, Steve.
- Okay.

1103
01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:00.290 line:82%
- Good night.
- Good night.

1104
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:18.850 line:82%
Yes, Dad.

1105
01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:21.150 line:82%
Yes.

1106
01:34:21.690 --> 01:34:23.230 line:82%
I'll tell Mr. Mehta

1107
01:34:24.570 --> 01:34:25.690 line:82%
How's Mom?

1108
01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:32.240 line:82%
Give her my love.
Alright, bye.

1109
01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.290 line:82%
Joan, could you send Mr. Mehta in please?

1110
01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.870 line:82%
- Yes, Akash.
- Mr. Mehta...

1111
01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:48.840 line:82%
Oh, I'm sorry. Steve!

1112
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:52.940 line:82%
Dad wants you to send him
a copy of the new contract.

1113
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.180 line:82%
Okay.

1114
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:55.890 line:82%
Steve.

1115
01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.510 line:82%
- You're coming to the meeting tomorrow?
- Of course.

1116
01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.650 line:82%
Good. Could you give me
all the files on that company?

1117
01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:03.680 line:82%
I'd like to study them before the meeting.

1118
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:05.550 line:82%
I'll send them in right away.

1119
01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:06.840 line:82%
Oh, and Steve...

1120
01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:09.740 line:82%
Yes, Akash?

1121
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:12.730 line:82%
Is there a good restaurant nearby?

1122
01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:23.210 line:82%
Thank you.

1123
01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.800 line:82%
- Wow, I'm really hungry.
- Yes.

1124
01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:34.890 line:82%
Wow, heaven.

1125
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:38.640 line:82%
Thanks for coming, Shalini.

1126
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.020 line:82%
To be alone in a new city
can be boring.

1127
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.210 line:82%
But you aren't alone.

1128
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:45.100 line:82%
Did I say I was bored?

1129
01:35:47.130 --> 01:35:48.480 line:82%
So strange.

1130
01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.200 line:82%
I never imagined we'd be talking
like this one day.

1131
01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:57.370 line:82%
Especially, after what happened.

1132
01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:01.250 line:82%
How is Rohit?

1133
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:04.880 line:82%
He's fine. I spoke to him this morning.

1134
01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:09.550 line:82%
I told him I met you on the flight and...

1135
01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.520 line:82%
And he doesn't like you
seeing me, right?

1136
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:16.590 line:82%
Well...

1137
01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.810 line:82%
But you're still here. Why?

1138
01:36:22.050 --> 01:36:24.760 line:82%
You don't know Rohit.

1139
01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.090 line:82%
He doesn't like me seeing any man.

1140
01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:28.940 line:82%
He's very possessive.

1141
01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:31.360 line:82%
But Rohit is a good guy.

1142
01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.470 line:82%
He has a few flaws.

1143
01:36:33.570 --> 01:36:37.010 line:82%
Don't we all have them?
Me, you...

1144
01:36:37.630 --> 01:36:40.050 line:82%
Me? And flaws?

1145
01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:43.910 line:82%
Tell me about yourself.

1146
01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:50.130 line:82%
- What do you want know?
- Let's see. Girlfriends?

1147
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:55.840 line:82%
Of course I have them.
But they only last two weeks.

1148
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:58.720 line:82%
Then another girlfriend for two weeks.

1149
01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.360 line:82%
- Then another for the next two weeks...
- Hold on.

1150
01:37:01.690 --> 01:37:06.540 line:82%
I understand your dating habits.
But I don't know why it's so.

1151
01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:11.360 line:82%
I've seen many of my friends
with their sweethearts.

1152
01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.740 line:82%
They have everything
but love for each other.

1153
01:37:15.710 --> 01:37:17.590 line:82%
That's why I'm better off as I am.

1154
01:37:17.670 --> 01:37:20.670 line:82%
No questions asked, no answers owed.

1155
01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.100 line:82%
What nonsense!

1156
01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:24.940 line:82%
I don't ask Rohit questions
nor do I demand answers.

1157
01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.000 line:82%
But he asks questions
and he demands answers!

1158
01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.560 line:82%
I'm not implying that
it's always the girl's fault.

1159
01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.800 line:82%
But all relationships begin
with smiles and end in tears.

1160
01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:40.230 line:82%
Oh! So is this a broken heart confessing?

1161
01:37:41.730 --> 01:37:43.640 line:82%
Now I get your two-week dating system.

1162
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:44.780 line:82%
It's not that.

1163
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:48.590 line:82%
I've decided not to fall in love
and ruin my life.

1164
01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:52.910 line:82%
But you can't choose to
fall in love. It just happens!

1165
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.730 line:82%
Then I don't let love happen.

1166
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:58.200 line:82%
Give it some time.
You'll fall in love.

1167
01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:03.180 line:82%
Why? Do you intend to marry me?

1168
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.330 line:82%
Akash!

1169
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:12.170 line:82%
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

1170
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:14.210 line:82%
How was your day?

1171
01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.050 line:82%
It was great.
- Yes?

1172
01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:21.430 line:82%
- Akash is nuts. He's so funny.
- Is he?

1173
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:25.400 line:82%
By the way, Rohit called.

1174
01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:27.350 line:82%
Twice.

1175
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.210 line:82%
- Where you are I swear I...
- Hello?

1176
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:42.630 line:82%
- Hi.
- Shalini, just a minute.

1177
01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:45.210 line:82%
Turn it down. It's my future wife.

1178
01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:48.220 line:82%
How are you?

1179
01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:50.320 line:82%
Slightly less drunk than you.

1180
01:38:52.690 --> 01:38:54.970 line:82%
Did you get my message?
Where were you?

1181
01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.140 line:82%
I went for lunch with Akash.

1182
01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:04.660 line:82%
I asked you not to see him.
Why don't you listen to me?

1183
01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:09.150 line:82%
Are you yelling at me
in front of your friends?

1184
01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.970 line:82%
I'm coming there.

1185
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:18.300 line:82%
It'll take some time, but I'll be there.

1186
01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:22.530 line:82%
As you wish, Rohit. Bye.

1187
01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.880 line:82%
Pooja, I was passing by,
so I thought...

1188
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.440 line:82%
If you aren't doing
anything, then...

1189
01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:37.210 line:82%
No!

1190
01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:41.630 line:82%
Pooja, I was nearby,
and I thought that...

1191
01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.750 line:82%
- Come on, Pooja.
- Mom, I'll call you later.

1192
01:40:03.710 --> 01:40:04.790 line:82%
Taxi!

1193
01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:24.350 line:82%
Hi! What a pleasant surprise!

1194
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.730 line:82%
Hi, how are you?

1195
01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:28.300 line:82%
- I'm fine. And you?
- I'm fine.

1196
01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:33.310 line:82%
Subodh, this is Sameer.
Sameer, this is Subodh.

1197
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:35.580 line:82%
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Yes.

1198
01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.450 line:82%
Waiting for someone?

1199
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:49.510 line:82%
Yes, but it seems
they won't show up now.

1200
01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:52.600 line:82%
Why don't you sit down?

1201
01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:56.410 line:82%
You're mannerless!
What are you doing?

1202
01:40:56.670 --> 01:40:59.100 line:82%
- Any plans after dinner?
- What sorry? Why sorry?

1203
01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:00.890 line:82%
- He should say sorry.
- No plans.

1204
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:02.190 line:82%
Come on, darling.

1205
01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:04.040 line:82%
- Let's go somewhere.
- Useless people!

1206
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.890 line:82%
- Shall we?
- What do you say, Subodh?

1207
01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.890 line:82%
I'm sorry, but I go to bed by ten.

1208
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:11.380 line:82%
Come on, Subodh.

1209
01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:13.710 line:82%
One night won't change your routine.

1210
01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:15.970 line:82%
Be a sport, man!
It's Sunday tomorrow.

1211
01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:17.350 line:82%
I know.

1212
01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:21.070 line:82%
Hence, I must be up at five
and do yoga, then some jogging

1213
01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:23.210 line:82%
and breakfast at eight sharp.

1214
01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:27.830 line:82%
On Sundays we spend the day
at Uncle Kumar's beach house.

1215
01:41:30.090 --> 01:41:31.630 line:82%
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

1216
01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.270 line:82%
Time for his bathroom visit I guess?

1217
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:42.130 line:82%
Stop it.
He's not that bad.

1218
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:48.930 line:82%
- So, where to?
- We'll see.

1219
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:53.650 line:82%
Well, if Mr. Timetable
won't come, we can go.

1220
01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:56.090 line:82%
Sure we could,

1221
01:41:57.150 --> 01:41:59.970 line:82%
- but maybe some other time.
- Of course.

1222
01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.680 line:82%
If I call you some time...

1223
01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:14.470 line:82%
It's okay.

1224
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:17.350 line:82%
Okay.

1225
01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.840 line:82%
Oh, wow!
What are we celebrating?

1226
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:27.160 line:82%
You've forgotten.

1227
01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.930 line:82%
Five months ago on this day
I told you how I felt about you.

1228
01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.770 line:82%
Really? Then this calls for a toast.

1229
01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.200 line:82%
A toast

1230
01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.380 line:82%
to Subodh and Pooja!

1231
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:56.090 line:82%
- How's the mood?
- Pretty serious.

1232
01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:01.150 line:82%
Really, Mahesh.

1233
01:43:01.850 --> 01:43:04.590 line:82%
There were such intense scenes
in the film.

1234
01:43:05.050 --> 01:43:07.050 line:82%
It was so moving.
I got choked up!

1235
01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:08.840 line:82%
Please cut out the farce

1236
01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.920 line:82%
and forgive me for taking you
to such a good film.

1237
01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:15.180 line:82%
- That's my problem, Mahesh.
- What?

1238
01:43:15.250 --> 01:43:17.220 line:82%
I don't like watching good films at all.

1239
01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.770 line:82%
You only like wham-bam action films.

1240
01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:23.840 line:82%
You deserve only those films.

1241
01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:26.780 line:82%
No need to not use your brains
or heart for them.

1242
01:43:26.850 --> 01:43:27.970 line:82%
You're right.

1243
01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.070 line:82%
You need brains for love stories.

1244
01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:33.330 line:82%
The heroine keeps crying,
the hero keeps sighing!

1245
01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.500 line:82%
What's all this lovey-dovey stuff, anyway?

1246
01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:38.530 line:82%
You won't get it.

1247
01:43:39.930 --> 01:43:41.540 line:82%
Don't hassle her, man. Let's go.

1248
01:44:00.690 --> 01:44:04.360 line:82%
Wonder why people fall in love

1249
01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.870 line:82%
Wonder why people are ready
to die for someone

1250
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:19.600 line:82%
Wonder why people fall in love

1251
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:23.550 line:82%
Wonder why people are ready
to die for someone

1252
01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.550 line:82%
I wonder why

1253
01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:35.040 line:82%
I wonder why!

1254
01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:43.810 line:82%
Just think about it.
In love, there's only sadness

1255
01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:48.990 line:82%
The cruelty inflicted by
love is endless

1256
01:44:49.570 --> 01:44:54.030 line:82%
In love, you need to be humble

1257
01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:58.700 line:82%
In pain, you still have to smile

1258
01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:02.420 line:82%
Why fill your life with poison?

1259
01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:10.260 line:82%
Wonder why people fall in love?

1260
01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:15.600 line:82%
I wonder why!

1261
01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:20.520 line:82%
I wonder why!

1262
01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:31.740 line:82%
What is life without love?

1263
01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:39.920 line:82%
Without love, a person is lonely

1264
01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:48.090 line:82%
What is life without love?

1265
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:51.970 line:82%
Without love, a person is lonely

1266
01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:55.770 line:82%
Love brings myriad
colors into your life

1267
01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:59.530 line:82%
Love adorns your life

1268
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.340 line:82%
People fall in love,
but don't admit it

1269
01:46:07.110 --> 01:46:10.820 line:82%
Wonder why speaking plainly
of love scares them?

1270
01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.460 line:82%
I wonder why!

1271
01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:21.220 line:82%
I wonder why!

1272
01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.030 line:82%
Love is forever

1273
01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:58.530 line:82%
Love is forever, and more

1274
01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:03.490 line:82%
Love is forever

1275
01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:08.630 line:82%
Live for love, die for love

1276
01:47:08.710 --> 01:47:11.920 line:82%
Love is a trouble for no reason

1277
01:47:13.710 --> 01:47:16.970 line:82%
Love is beautiful in every season

1278
01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:22.220 line:82%
We're better off keeping away from love

1279
01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.850 line:82%
Love in every guise is truth

1280
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:31.570 line:82%
Those who wade into love's waters

1281
01:47:31.630 --> 01:47:35.740 line:82%
neither sink nor swim

1282
01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:38.190 line:82%
I wonder why!

1283
01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:41.950 line:82%
Everyone falls in love

1284
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:45.760 line:82%
Wonder why only you avoid it

1285
01:47:45.850 --> 01:47:52.250 line:82%
I wonder why!

1286
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:57.220 line:82%
I wonder why!

1287
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:11.270 line:82%
Love is forever

1288
01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:16.320 line:82%
Love is forever, and more

1289
01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:21.070 line:82%
Love is forever

1290
01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.290 line:82%
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1291
01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:35.310 line:82%
Shalini, why are you so scared
of the roller-coaster ride?

1292
01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:37.000 line:82%
I'm not scared.

1293
01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:42.800 line:82%
I think only people with a mental problem
enjoy such rides.

1294
01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:48.970 line:82%
Good excuse. You need guts
to go on these rides!

1295
01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:52.600 line:82%
Don't worry. There are many
cowards here like you.

1296
01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.060 line:82%
There's one right there.

1297
01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.140 line:82%
Very funny.
But it's not like that.

1298
01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:05.570 line:82%
If it's not like that,
come with me on that ride.

1299
01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.360 line:82%
No way!

1300
01:49:10.450 --> 01:49:12.160 line:82%
Why? Don't you have guts?

1301
01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:14.960 line:82%
It's getting late.

1302
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:22.220 line:82%
I'm going on that ride.

1303
01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:26.010 line:82%
Come with me
or sit here and get bored.

1304
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:33.730 line:82%
You're a real coward!

1305
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:43.240 line:82%
Excuse me. Do you mind?

1306
01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:15.600 line:82%
We're going to die!

1307
01:50:16.110 --> 01:50:17.560 line:82%
Oh!

1308
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:36.370 line:82%
Hurry! We'll miss the train!
Come on!

1309
01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:38.170 line:82%
Come on.

1310
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:43.090 line:82%
Hey, wait.

1311
01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:17.450 line:82%
- Hey, wait up, man.
- Let's go!

1312
01:51:17.530 --> 01:51:18.740 line:82%
Hey, let's go.

1313
01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:21.000 line:82%
- Wait for me, man!
- Come on, mate!

1314
01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.400 line:82%
- Come on...
- You okay, mate?

1315
01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:44.210 line:82%
- Did she scare you? You're okay?
- Oh, God! Get off of me, mate!

1316
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:48.380 line:82%
Don't worry, I'm here now.
It's okay.

1317
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:58.010 line:82%
Shalini, you scared that old man!

1318
01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.140 line:82%
I hate you!

1319
01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:10.780 line:82%
Hi.

1320
01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.110 line:82%
How was it?

1321
01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.220 line:82%
Great. They like my work.

1322
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:21.160 line:82%
- Really?
- And they want me to go back.

1323
01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:23.450 line:82%
That's wonderful.

1324
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:25.200 line:82%
When do you have to go back?

1325
01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:28.110 line:82%
Mom, I've just returned
and you want me to go back?

1326
01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:32.040 line:82%
Did you talk to Sameer?

1327
01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:33.460 line:82%
No. Why?

1328
01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:36.920 line:82%
He came over the morning you left.

1329
01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.640 line:82%
He looked worried.

1330
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:43.340 line:82%
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

1331
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:55.570 line:82%
Hey, when did you come back?

1332
01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:58.860 line:82%
So good to see you, man.

1333
01:53:58.950 --> 01:54:02.360 line:82%
- How are you? How was it?
- Great! How are you?

1334
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:05.630 line:82%
It's a long story.
Let's go up and talk.

1335
01:54:05.710 --> 01:54:06.790 line:82%
Yes, sure.

1336
01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:13.380 line:82%
So that's the situation.

1337
01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:17.130 line:82%
You're good friends, you meet

1338
01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:18.960 line:82%
but you haven't told her how you feel.

1339
01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:21.850 line:82%
I've tried very hard.

1340
01:54:24.850 --> 01:54:26.430 line:82%
But I just can't say it.

1341
01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:29.270 line:82%
Yes.

1342
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:32.680 line:82%
- Didn't she have a boyfriend?
- Yup.

1343
01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:35.440 line:82%
She had. But not anymore!

1344
01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.570 line:82%
I wonder what Pooja saw in him.

1345
01:54:38.650 --> 01:54:41.700 line:82%
He was alright, but what a bore!

1346
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:46.800 line:82%
One day I went for a drive with them.

1347
01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:53.340 line:82%
That's where I met Pooja for the
first time... on September 15th.

1348
01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.460 line:82%
And exactly seven days later,

1349
01:54:57.550 --> 01:55:00.340 line:82%
on the 22nd, we came here
to have ice cream.

1350
01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:05.090 line:82%
Don't you remember the time, Subodh?

1351
01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:08.640 line:82%
Of course, I do.
It was precisely 5:55 PM.

1352
01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.180 line:82%
That's not all.

1353
01:55:18.690 --> 01:55:21.990 line:82%
He bought her a balloon every day.

1354
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:24.410 line:82%
- A Balloon?
- Yes.

1355
01:55:24.970 --> 01:55:28.170 line:82%
Heart-shaped balloons you can
buy at traffic signals.

1356
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:29.770 line:82%
Heart-shaped balloons!

1357
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:35.310 line:82%
That's okay, but every day?
Every day... a balloon!

1358
01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:43.090 line:82%
I knew the guy was deranged.

1359
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:45.640 line:82%
Crazy!

1360
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:57.100 line:82%
Sameer, if you love Pooja so much
why haven't you told her?

1361
01:55:59.610 --> 01:56:00.990 line:82%
I've been afraid.

1362
01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:05.890 line:82%
I mean, what if Pooja rejects me?

1363
01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:12.810 line:82%
I'll lose our friendship
and I'll be all alone.

1364
01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.500 line:82%
You weren't here.
Neither was Akash.

1365
01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.510 line:82%
Anyway!

1366
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:30.630 line:82%
You're back and I feel stronger
knowing you're with me.

1367
01:56:31.670 --> 01:56:33.730 line:82%
I'm always here for you, Sameer.

1368
01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:38.570 line:82%
Then should I tell her today?

1369
01:56:40.810 --> 01:56:41.930 line:82%
Tell her.

1370
01:56:45.190 --> 01:56:47.820 line:82%
Pooja, I want to talk to you.

1371
01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:55.710 line:82%
I wonder what if our parents hadn't tried
to arrange our marriage?

1372
01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:00.810 line:82%
If we hadn't met the way we did?

1373
01:57:01.390 --> 01:57:05.280 line:82%
If I'd met you somewhere,
would we be as we are now?

1374
01:57:05.530 --> 01:57:08.180 line:82%
If we weren't as we are,
how would we be?

1375
01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:12.800 line:82%
If we thought differently of each other,
what would happen?

1376
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:18.650 line:82%
Now what's happening?
What am I saying?

1377
01:57:20.230 --> 01:57:22.480 line:82%
You're saying lots of ifs.

1378
01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:25.550 line:82%
What is it, Sameer?

1379
01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:30.320 line:82%
It's just that, Pooja...

1380
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:33.540 line:82%
I've fallen in love with you.

1381
01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:38.710 line:82%
I agree we don't know
each other very well.

1382
01:57:39.090 --> 01:57:43.420 line:82%
But I understand the love
that you're seeking.

1383
01:57:45.130 --> 01:57:47.090 line:82%
If you trust me a bit,

1384
01:57:47.890 --> 01:57:49.760 line:82%
believe me, I'm saying the truth.

1385
01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:04.750 line:82%
Where's That Girl?

1386
01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:37.990 line:82%
I look for her everywhere,
the girl I've never found

1387
01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:43.420 line:82%
Whose love I can trust.
Where's that girl?

1388
01:58:48.150 --> 01:58:53.090 line:82%
She who loves only me.
She who's ready to confess

1389
01:58:53.170 --> 01:58:58.540 line:82%
She's ready to call me her sweetheart.
Where's that girl?

1390
01:59:08.230 --> 01:59:12.950 line:82%
She who lives in your dreams,
is the beautiful idol of love

1391
01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:18.350 line:82%
You will find her someday,
if you keep looking for her

1392
01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:28.530 line:82%
Let's go and search for her.
This angel, this dainty damsel

1393
01:59:28.610 --> 01:59:33.910 line:82%
Once you see her, you will say:
"Oh! She's right here"

1394
02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:13.340 line:82%
I wonder why this thought
crossed my mind

1395
02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:18.930 line:82%
You could you be the girl
I want to find

1396
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:24.135 line:82%
You have all the virtues
that I was looking for

1397
02:00:24.226 --> 02:00:29.000 line:82%
You have all the virtues
that I was looking for

1398
02:00:29.090 --> 02:00:34.270 line:82%
I think you are deluded.
I wonder what you think I am

1399
02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:39.820 line:82%
I am no angel, no a nymph.
Don't be under such illusions

1400
02:00:44.210 --> 02:00:48.970 line:82%
I look for her everywhere,
the girl I've never found

1401
02:00:49.130 --> 02:00:54.480 line:82%
Whose love I can trust.
Where's that girl?

1402
02:01:29.890 --> 02:01:34.010 line:82%
Suppose I say

1403
02:01:34.230 --> 02:01:39.770 line:82%
that I dream only about you

1404
02:01:39.870 --> 02:01:44.090 line:82%
You know, it's my desire

1405
02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:49.700 line:82%
That you be with me for evermore

1406
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:54.820 line:82%
What have you made me believe?
How you make my heart race!

1407
02:01:54.910 --> 02:02:00.680 line:82%
You melt my body and soul by
whispering sweet nothings

1408
02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:15.070 line:82%
I look for her everywhere,
the girl I've never found

1409
02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:17.600 line:82%
Whose love I can trust

1410
02:02:17.670 --> 02:02:22.700 line:82%
- Where's that girl?
- That girl is here

1411
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:27.730 line:82%
- Where's that girl?
- That girl is here

1412
02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:32.600 line:82%
- Where's that girl?
- That girl is here

1413
02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:38.520 line:82%
- Where's that girl?
- That girl is here

1414
02:03:06.930 --> 02:03:10.400 line:82%
I can't believe it's already
time for you to leave.

1415
02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.900 line:82%
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll be back soon.

1416
02:03:14.530 --> 02:03:18.860 line:82%
Three months is not soon.
That's how long you were away.

1417
02:03:20.610 --> 02:03:22.870 line:82%
How long will you be gone next time?

1418
02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:29.550 line:82%
Siddharth, have you thought
about marriage?

1419
02:03:30.170 --> 02:03:31.290 line:82%
Mom.

1420
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:34.060 line:82%
What does that mean?

1421
02:03:36.050 --> 02:03:37.430 line:82%
Some other day, okay?

1422
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:39.680 line:82%
Why some other day?
Why not now?

1423
02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:44.770 line:82%
How do I explain it to you?

1424
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:48.080 line:82%
Forget it.
You won't understand!

1425
02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.560 line:82%
Then help me understand.

1426
02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:51.920 line:82%
I am your mother.

1427
02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:54.270 line:82%
If I don't understand you, who will?

1428
02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:58.410 line:82%
Are you in love with someone?

1429
02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:05.460 line:82%
Sid, what is it?

1430
02:04:06.230 --> 02:04:07.800 line:82%
You've never hidden anything from me.

1431
02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:10.950 line:82%
Yes, Mom, but some things
can't be explained.

1432
02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:16.350 line:82%
I agree, but I can see that
something's bothering you.

1433
02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:19.090 line:82%
Will you bottle it up forever?

1434
02:04:25.930 --> 02:04:28.100 line:82%
Mom, I'm telling you,
you won't understand.

1435
02:04:28.450 --> 02:04:30.050 line:82%
Tell me what I won't understand.

1436
02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.730 line:82%
Try telling me.

1437
02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:35.400 line:82%
Sid, I love you.

1438
02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:39.030 line:82%
What is it that I don't have
the right to know?

1439
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:44.280 line:82%
What is the matter?

1440
02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:49.680 line:82%
Tara...

1441
02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:51.920 line:82%
Tara?

1442
02:04:56.130 --> 02:04:57.590 line:82%
You mean Tara Jaiswal?

1443
02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:02.510 line:82%
I've seen her many times,
but she...

1444
02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:05.930 line:82%
Since when?

1445
02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:07.970 line:82%
I don't know.

1446
02:05:08.050 --> 02:05:10.470 line:82%
- I don't know since when.
- Sid! Enough!

1447
02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.730 line:82%
I won't let you ruin your life.

1448
02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.710 line:82%
Have you any idea what you are saying?

1449
02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:18.930 line:82%
My son is in love
with a woman who...

1450
02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:21.190 line:82%
You were right.
I don't understand!

1451
02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:25.270 line:82%
Has she said that she loves you?

1452
02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:28.280 line:82%
She must have trapped you
with her sob story.

1453
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:29.950 line:82%
- What did she tell you?
- Nothing!

1454
02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:37.630 line:82%
She doesn't even know...

1455
02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:48.760 line:82%
Your mom is absolutely right, Siddharth.

1456
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:51.730 line:82%
Don't ruin your life over me.

1457
02:05:52.150 --> 02:05:57.340 line:82%
And please don't snatch the little peace
left in my life.

1458
02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:19.090 line:82%
Siddharth, please go away...

1459
02:06:19.170 --> 02:06:22.000 line:82%
- Please listen to me.
- I don't want to hear anything.

1460
02:06:22.670 --> 02:06:24.930 line:82%
Have I ever made you feel

1461
02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:28.180 line:82%
that I love you or seek
a relationship with you?

1462
02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:30.520 line:82%
No.

1463
02:06:30.610 --> 02:06:34.140 line:82%
Then how did you assume
that you and I

1464
02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:36.000 line:82%
could have a relationship?

1465
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:41.590 line:82%
This is the problem with your generation.

1466
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:44.650 line:82%
You think anything goes.

1467
02:06:45.710 --> 02:06:47.420 line:82%
But that's not so, Siddharth.

1468
02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:54.790 line:82%
You've also hurt your mom,
not just me.

1469
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:58.210 line:82%
Please sit down.

1470
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:01.820 line:82%
Please.

1471
02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:24.360 line:82%
I'm so sorry.

1472
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:31.660 line:82%
I'm so sorry that I caused you
and Mom such pain.

1473
02:07:35.130 --> 02:07:38.090 line:82%
I'm sorry you had to hear
all this because of me.

1474
02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:43.130 line:82%
But it's true that I love you.

1475
02:07:46.710 --> 02:07:48.510 line:82%
I'm not sorry for that.

1476
02:07:56.530 --> 02:07:59.970 line:82%
It's also true that
I never wanted you to know it.

1477
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:04.010 line:82%
Because I knew that you

1478
02:08:05.650 --> 02:08:06.950 line:82%
wouldn't understand.

1479
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:13.650 line:82%
I just want to see you happy.

1480
02:08:18.230 --> 02:08:23.370 line:82%
And if knowing the truth has
caused you pain today,

1481
02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:28.920 line:82%
then all I can say is that
it was not my intention.

1482
02:08:31.810 --> 02:08:33.050 line:82%
I'm so sorry.

1483
02:08:41.590 --> 02:08:42.890 line:82%
Sid.

1484
02:08:43.570 --> 02:08:45.090 line:82%
Please leave now.

1485
02:09:19.150 --> 02:09:20.470 line:82%
After the workshop,

1486
02:09:22.670 --> 02:09:25.210 line:82%
I think I'll stay at Uncle's farmhouse.

1487
02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:29.020 line:82%
It's a good place to paint.

1488
02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:32.390 line:82%
Nice and quiet.

1489
02:09:39.190 --> 02:09:40.560 line:82%
Will you come with me?

1490
02:09:44.490 --> 02:09:46.280 line:82%
I don't want to go there without you.

1491
02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:12.180 line:82%
Hello?

1492
02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:15.640 line:82%
- Ah, he is. Its's for you.
- Okay, thanks.

1493
02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:17.770 line:82%
Hello?

1494
02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:21.320 line:82%
Oh! Hi, Shalini. I'm fine.

1495
02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:27.250 line:82%
Just a minute. Sorry, Rachel.
Can I borrow your pen?

1496
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:29.910 line:82%
Thanks.

1497
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:32.040 line:82%
Tell me.

1498
02:10:33.010 --> 02:10:35.790 line:82%
I see. Okay.

1499
02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:11.640 line:82%
- Hi.
- Hi.

1500
02:11:11.710 --> 02:11:13.250 line:82%
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1501
02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:16.020 line:82%
We're going now. It's been
a pleasure to meet you.

1502
02:11:16.110 --> 02:11:18.090 line:82%
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1503
02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:23.970 line:82%
- You look very lovely.
- Thank you.

1504
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:30.600 line:82%
So, why are we here?

1505
02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:36.060 line:82%
To prove to you that a thing called
love exists in this world.

1506
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:40.560 line:82%
Why are you after my life?

1507
02:11:41.140 --> 02:11:42.240 line:82%
Shut up.

1508
02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:44.610 line:82%
Let's go in. We're going to be late.
Come on.

1509
02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:13.600 line:82%
- Why are we here?
- To watch the opera.

1510
02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:18.400 line:82%
- Yes, but why?
- You'll find out why.

1511
02:12:18.970 --> 02:12:20.020 line:82%
Shush.

1512
02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:28.470 line:82%
The girl is Cressida
and the boy is Troilus.

1513
02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:31.550 line:82%
They love each other.

1514
02:13:50.570 --> 02:13:52.410 line:82%
But Troilus must go now.

1515
02:13:53.330 --> 02:13:55.700 line:82%
He must go to war for his kingdom.

1516
02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.040 line:82%
Cressida is afraid that
something might happen to him.

1517
02:14:01.670 --> 02:14:04.340 line:82%
Troilus tells her
nothing will happen to him.

1518
02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:31.270 line:82%
This is the soul of Troilus,
at Heaven's gate.

1519
02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:34.510 line:82%
He doesn't want to go inside.

1520
02:15:36.590 --> 02:15:38.790 line:82%
He implores God for a single day.

1521
02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:43.350 line:82%
He wants to meet Cressida
for the one last time.

1522
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:48.580 line:82%
To tell her how much he loves her.

1523
02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:53.690 line:82%
If he's granted that one day,

1524
02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:57.160 line:82%
he is willing to die a thousand deaths.

1525
02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:07.040 line:82%
Close your eyes, Akash.

1526
02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:15.680 line:82%
Now try to think about the person

1527
02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:20.640 line:82%
you'd gladly die a thousand deaths
to spend a single day with?

1528
02:16:22.930 --> 02:16:24.270 line:82%
Who is that person?

1529
02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:00.150 line:82%
Good night.

1530
02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:02.910 line:82%
Not so fast.

1531
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:06.800 line:82%
You still haven't told me
who you saw.

1532
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:10.500 line:82%
You're sure I saw someone?

1533
02:18:11.170 --> 02:18:15.940 line:82%
Yes, because for the first time
you're talking less and thinking more.

1534
02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:22.840 line:82%
Come on. You can tell me.

1535
02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:28.360 line:82%
Then listen.

1536
02:18:30.350 --> 02:18:31.889 line:82%
I saw her.

1537
02:18:33.590 --> 02:18:37.480 line:82%
I felt perhaps this is what
they call love.

1538
02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:43.000 line:82%
It was magical.

1539
02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:46.120 line:82%
I wanted to touch her

1540
02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:49.830 line:82%
and hold her in my arms.

1541
02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:55.640 line:82%
I saw innocence in her eyes,

1542
02:18:58.150 --> 02:19:00.050 line:82%
like what I see in your eyes now.

1543
02:19:04.130 --> 02:19:07.470 line:82%
Her voice was magical, like yours.

1544
02:19:09.250 --> 02:19:13.340 line:82%
I could smell the fragrance in her breath

1545
02:19:13.430 --> 02:19:15.390 line:82%
like the way I feel your breath now.

1546
02:19:16.810 --> 02:19:18.230 line:82%
Who was she?

1547
02:19:28.990 --> 02:19:30.620 line:82%
That fat opera singer!

1548
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:49.300 line:82%
Shalini!

1549
02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:52.970 line:82%
Shalini, come inside.

1550
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:55.480 line:82%
Right now.

1551
02:20:00.390 --> 02:20:01.610 line:82%
Bye.

1552
02:20:49.060 --> 02:20:51.320 line:82%
I think you should talk alone.

1553
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:01.380 line:82%
Where were you?

1554
02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:03.340 line:82%
At the opera.

1555
02:21:05.010 --> 02:21:06.370 line:82%
With Akash?

1556
02:21:07.470 --> 02:21:10.530 line:82%
How many times have I told you
not to see Akash?

1557
02:21:13.150 --> 02:21:16.670 line:82%
Rohit, will you always keep telling me

1558
02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:18.600 line:82%
whom I should or shouldn't see?

1559
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:25.110 line:82%
Yes. And you'll never see Akash again.

1560
02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:26.800 line:82%
Got that?

1561
02:21:27.070 --> 02:21:28.610 line:82%
You're hurting me, Rohit.

1562
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:31.180 line:82%
Rohit, you're hurting me.

1563
02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:36.270 line:82%
Rohit, I need time to think.
And so do you.

1564
02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:37.640 line:82%
Can I get you anything?

1565
02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:52.590 line:82%
As on November 15th...

1566
02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:54.180 line:82%
-Morning, Steve. Hi, Joan.
- I would like to...

1567
02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:56.210 line:82%
Good morning, Mr. Malhotra.
Your mother called.

1568
02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:58.290 line:82%
- Shalini called.

1569
02:22:58.370 --> 02:23:01.700 line:82%
- She said it's important.
- Thank you.

1570
02:23:02.090 --> 02:23:03.280 line:82%
I would like to reconfirm...

1571
02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:14.670 line:82%
- Hello?
- Hi, Rohit? It's Akash.

1572
02:23:15.690 --> 02:23:18.200 line:82%
Is Shalini there?
She called.

1573
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:21.280 line:82%
I know. We are going back

1574
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:23.200 line:82%
to get married.

1575
02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:26.950 line:82%
Congratulations.

1576
02:23:28.290 --> 02:23:29.415 line:82%
- Could I speak to Shalini?

1577
02:23:29.806 --> 02:23:30.920 line:82%
- Sure.

1578
02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:35.600 line:82%
Shalini, it's Akash.

1579
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:53.750 line:82%
Hello.

1580
02:23:54.650 --> 02:23:56.020 line:82%
Congratulations.

1581
02:23:57.160 --> 02:23:58.270 line:82%
It's good news.

1582
02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:03.160 line:82%
We're going back tomorrow.

1583
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:05.880 line:82%
Can you come for dinner tonight?

1584
02:24:08.930 --> 02:24:11.160 line:82%
I don't know. Bye.

1585
02:24:26.970 --> 02:24:30.470 line:82%
Akash. We didn't think
you'd show up. Come in.

1586
02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:32.770 line:82%
Thanks.

1587
02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:44.840 line:82%
Hi.

1588
02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:47.860 line:82%
Hi.

1589
02:25:00.850 --> 02:25:01.850 line:82%
Hi.

1590
02:25:09.570 --> 02:25:11.160 line:82%
Congratulations.

1591
02:25:11.970 --> 02:25:14.890 line:82%
They're beautiful. Thanks.

1592
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:17.590 line:82%
What will you drink?

1593
02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:21.090 line:82%
We can drink later.
Let's eat first.

1594
02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:23.350 line:82%
I'm starving. Come.

1595
02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:33.530 line:82%
- Akash, have some more.
- No, thanks.

1596
02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:35.100 line:82%
- Shalini.
- No.

1597
02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:36.580 line:82%
- Rohit.
- I'm full. Thank you.

1598
02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:51.175 line:82%
Shalini, did you tell Uncle
Mahesh

1599
02:25:51.256 --> 02:25:53.550 line:82%
how Akash and you met?

1600
02:25:57.380 --> 02:25:58.440 line:82%
Haven't you?

1601
02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:03.190 line:82%
Uncle Mahesh, I don't know
what you'd have done

1602
02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:04.450 line:82%
had you been in my place.

1603
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:06.570 line:82%
Why? What happened?

1604
02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:09.240 line:82%
It was my graduation party.

1605
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:13.370 line:82%
Shalini was with me
and Akash didn't know that...

1606
02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:22.050 line:82%
Akash,

1607
02:26:23.330 --> 02:26:26.300 line:82%
sorry for the punch.
No hard feelings.

1608
02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:30.720 line:82%
No, Rohit. It was my fault.

1609
02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:36.400 line:82%
But to tell you the truth I was lucky.

1610
02:26:37.610 --> 02:26:38.610 line:82%
How?

1611
02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:42.530 line:82%
I mean, if Shalini was with me,

1612
02:26:43.490 --> 02:26:45.530 line:82%
and someone had acted fresh,

1613
02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:48.250 line:82%
then I'd have killed him.

1614
02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:51.700 line:82%
I would've killed him!

1615
02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:05.260 line:82%
That is if Shalini was with you.

1616
02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:12.580 line:82%
Excuse me.

1617
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:36.030 line:82%
Shalini.

1618
02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:39.050 line:82%
- Thank you.
- Hey, wait.

1619
02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:41.620 line:82%
Thanks.

1620
02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:43.550 line:82%
- Rohit.
- Thank you.

1621
02:27:46.410 --> 02:27:49.530 line:82%
To the most beautiful girl I know.
To Shalini.

1622
02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:51.130 line:82%
To Shalini.

1623
02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:02.130 line:82%
You're coming for our wedding,
aren't you?

1624
02:28:03.450 --> 02:28:06.030 line:82%
I won't make it. There's
a lot of work to be done.

1625
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.610 line:82%
Come on. That's not friendship.

1626
02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:13.870 line:82%
Anyway, don't forget to
invite us to your wedding.

1627
02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:15.630 line:82%
We'll be there for sure.

1628
02:28:16.170 --> 02:28:18.000 line:82%
I'm not getting married.

1629
02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:19.870 line:82%
Why?

1630
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.590 line:82%
You have to love someone to marry.

1631
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:26.860 line:82%
In my view,

1632
02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:30.030 line:82%
this thing called love
doesn't exist in this world.

1633
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:31.430 line:82%
What nonsense!

1634
02:28:31.630 --> 02:28:35.520 line:82%
Shalini and I love each other,
that's why we're marrying. Right, Shalini?

1635
02:28:38.890 --> 02:28:41.100 line:82%
You should not ask this to each other,

1636
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.610 line:82%
but to yourself.

1637
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:48.670 line:82%
Anyway...

1638
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:50.750 line:82%
I'd better go.

1639
02:28:51.870 --> 02:28:53.870 line:82%
- Thanks, Mahesh.
- Bye, Akash.

1640
02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:57.790 line:82%
- Congratulations, once again.
- Thanks.

1641
02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:03.570 line:82%
Bye.

1642
02:29:13.830 --> 02:29:14.920 line:82%
Akash.

1643
02:29:23.810 --> 02:29:26.070 line:82%
You left your jacket with me
the other night.

1644
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:29.900 line:82%
Thanks.

1645
02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:35.560 line:82%
- Good night.
- Akash...

1646
02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:44.320 line:82%
Someday I want to tell you
why I'm marrying Rohit.

1647
02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:46.110 line:82%
Why?

1648
02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.140 line:82%
What's the need to tell me?

1649
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:55.080 line:82%
I need to because we both know

1650
02:29:58.620 --> 02:30:00.790 line:82%
that when you closed
your eyes at the opera

1651
02:30:01.930 --> 02:30:04.300 line:82%
you didn't see that fat singer.

1652
02:30:30.310 --> 02:30:36.920 line:82%
Loneliness

1653
02:30:40.210 --> 02:30:44.560 line:82%
Loneliness

1654
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:54.990 line:82%
Such blows I've suffered
on the path of love

1655
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:59.630 line:82%
All my dreams lie shattered,
clouds of dejection above me

1656
02:30:59.710 --> 02:31:04.380 line:82%
Every joy is numb

1657
02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:09.870 line:82%
My life is lost

1658
02:31:10.250 --> 02:31:14.760 line:82%
For loving you,
I am punished with

1659
02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:19.720 line:82%
loneliness

1660
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:24.310 line:82%
Loneliness all around me

1661
02:31:24.770 --> 02:31:29.690 line:82%
Loneliness

1662
02:31:30.050 --> 02:31:34.360 line:82%
Loneliness all around me

1663
02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:19.660 line:82%
In my dream,
I saw a drape in my hand

1664
02:32:24.190 --> 02:32:29.960 line:82%
Now shards of a shattered
dream pierce my eyes

1665
02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:38.960 line:82%
In my dream,
I saw a drape in my hand

1666
02:32:39.050 --> 02:32:43.960 line:82%
Now shards of a shattered dream
pierce my eyes

1667
02:32:44.050 --> 02:32:48.480 line:82%
Someone was here yesterday

1668
02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:53.910 line:82%
But today, there is no one

1669
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:58.810 line:82%
A venom taints my every breath

1670
02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:01.350 line:82%
Loneliness

1671
02:33:01.450 --> 02:33:08.410 line:82%
Loneliness has filled my eyes
with a million tears

1672
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:11.270 line:82%
Loneliness

1673
02:33:11.370 --> 02:33:18.160 line:82%
Loneliness has filled my eyes
with a million tears

1674
02:33:58.300 --> 02:34:04.180 line:82%
How could I pin my hopes
on something so futile?

1675
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:14.320 line:82%
I set out on a long journey
I couldn't finish

1676
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:22.980 line:82%
How could I pin my hopes
on something so futile?

1677
02:34:23.070 --> 02:34:27.730 line:82%
I set out on a long journey
I couldn't finish

1678
02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:31.930 line:82%
Where shall I go now?

1679
02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:37.920 line:82%
To whom shall I explain

1680
02:34:38.250 --> 02:34:42.850 line:82%
What I had wanted
and what fate had in store?

1681
02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:45.390 line:82%
Loneliness

1682
02:34:45.470 --> 02:34:52.390 line:82%
Loneliness as deep as the dark night

1683
02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:06.870 line:82%
Such blows I've suffered
on the path of love

1684
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:11.490 line:82%
All my dreams lie shattered,
clouds of dejection above me

1685
02:35:11.580 --> 02:35:16.420 line:82%
Every joy is numb

1686
02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:22.150 line:82%
My life is lost

1687
02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:26.800 line:82%
For loving you,
I am punished with

1688
02:35:26.890 --> 02:35:31.770 line:82%
loneliness

1689
02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:36.270 line:82%
Loneliness all around me

1690
02:35:36.730 --> 02:35:38.310 line:82%
Loneliness

1691
02:35:41.690 --> 02:35:43.610 line:82%
Loneliness

1692
02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:48.700 line:82%
Loneliness

1693
02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:53.620 line:82%
Loneliness

1694
02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:22.990 line:82%
Hello?

1695
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:26.550 line:82%
- Hello, Mrs. Sinha. Is Sameer home?
- Who's calling?

1696
02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:29.980 line:82%
Akash.

1697
02:36:30.210 --> 02:36:33.030 line:82%
You want Sameer
but you've called Siddharth.

1698
02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:37.570 line:82%
- How are you?
- I'm fine, Mrs. Sinha.

1699
02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:39.650 line:82%
He has gone to Kasauli.

1700
02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:42.100 line:82%
Give me your number, I'll tell him.

1701
02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:46.200 line:82%
No, it's okay, Mrs. Sinha.
I'll call him.

1702
02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:48.430 line:82%
Thank you. Bye.

1703
02:37:37.220 --> 02:37:39.000 line:82%
- Hello?
- Hey, Akash.

1704
02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:40.750 line:82%
How are you, Son?

1705
02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:45.710 line:82%
I am fine, Dad.

1706
02:37:47.710 --> 02:37:48.930 line:82%
What's wrong?

1707
02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:50.910 line:82%
Are you not well?

1708
02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:53.900 line:82%
Nothing like that.

1709
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:56.245 line:82%
I'm busy all day.

1710
02:37:56.426 --> 02:37:57.690 line:82%
I get tired, that's all.

1711
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000 line:82%
Akash?

1712
02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:05.980 line:82%
Yes, Dad?

1713
02:38:09.610 --> 02:38:11.350 line:82%
Akash, come back home.

1714
02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:15.120 line:82%
I want you to come back.

1715
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:41.690 line:82%
What's wrong, Akash?

1716
02:38:43.170 --> 02:38:45.020 line:82%
I've never seen you like this before.

1717
02:38:46.310 --> 02:38:47.540 line:82%
I'm in love, Dad.

1718
02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:53.090 line:82%
So, what's the problem?

1719
02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:56.140 line:82%
She's marrying someone else.

1720
02:38:57.350 --> 02:38:58.630 line:82%
Oh.

1721
02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:02.800 line:82%
Have you told her you love her?

1722
02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:06.250 line:82%
No.

1723
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:08.560 line:82%
Does she love you?

1724
02:39:12.990 --> 02:39:14.030 line:82%
She does.

1725
02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:17.950 line:82%
Has she told that to you?

1726
02:39:23.730 --> 02:39:27.950 line:82%
Akash, I think you must tell her
how you feel.

1727
02:39:30.810 --> 02:39:32.700 line:82%
- No.
- Why not?

1728
02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:37.550 line:82%
She's marrying someone else.

1729
02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:39.750 line:82%
Akash.

1730
02:39:41.570 --> 02:39:45.790 line:82%
There are many things that are
beyond our understanding.

1731
02:39:47.020 --> 02:39:49.720 line:82%
When a person decides something,

1732
02:39:49.810 --> 02:39:53.070 line:82%
there's a reason for it.

1733
02:39:54.340 --> 02:39:57.200 line:82%
You say she loves you,

1734
02:39:57.700 --> 02:40:00.000 line:82%
but she's marrying someone else.

1735
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:05.000 line:82%
Have you tried to find out
why she is doing this?

1736
02:40:07.700 --> 02:40:09.590 line:82%
What is the reason for her decision?

1737
02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:24.250 line:82%
Good to see you.

1738
02:40:29.490 --> 02:40:30.690 line:82%
How's Shalini?

1739
02:40:32.210 --> 02:40:33.240 line:82%
Not happy.

1740
02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:36.130 line:82%
How can she be?

1741
02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:40.110 line:82%
She's marrying Rohit,
but loves you.

1742
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:46.210 line:82%
- Did she tell you that?
- No.

1743
02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:50.060 line:82%
Did you ever tell me you love her?

1744
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:57.350 line:82%
Then why is she marrying Rohit?

1745
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.800 line:82%
Rohit's and Shalini's father
were business partners.

1746
02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:09.870 line:82%
Shalini was six when her parents
were killed in a car accident.

1747
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:13.170 line:82%
I was her only relative.

1748
02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:16.580 line:82%
I was struggling back then.

1749
02:41:19.540 --> 02:41:23.690 line:82%
Rohit's parents took her into
their home and their hearts.

1750
02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:26.580 line:82%
They did a lot for her.

1751
02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:29.940 line:82%
If they want her to marry Rohit

1752
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:31.740 line:82%
she feels she can't refuse.

1753
02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:35.500 line:82%
What choice does she have?

1754
02:41:37.030 --> 02:41:40.750 line:82%
On one hand, there are
those who've looked after her.

1755
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:46.250 line:82%
On the other hand, a man who
she's not sure loves her.

1756
02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:48.340 line:82%
Akash.

1757
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:52.130 line:82%
What are you doing, man?
Tell her you love her.

1758
02:41:55.390 --> 02:41:57.560 line:82%
Akash, only you can decide what to do.

1759
02:41:58.850 --> 02:42:01.180 line:82%
But tonight there's a musical ceremony

1760
02:42:02.450 --> 02:42:04.020 line:82%
and the wedding takes place tomorrow.

1761
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:08.750 line:82%
Whatever you decide,
you must decide today.

1762
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:12.540 line:82%
With a lot of affection

1763
02:42:12.610 --> 02:42:14.270 line:82%
I use the spinning wheel of sandalwood

1764
02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:18.500 line:82%
Spinning wheel of sandalwood

1765
02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:22.110 line:82%
It's for sale in the big market

1766

Hi.

1803
02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:21.740 line:82%
Hi.

1804
02:44:23.430 --> 02:44:24.780 line:82%
Will you marry me?

1805
02:44:33.970 --> 02:44:36.680 line:82%
Even if I tell you I love you?
Not even then?

1806
02:44:40.510 --> 02:44:41.760 line:82%
You bloody...

1807
02:45:17.970 --> 02:45:19.100 line:82%
Shalini.

1808
02:45:20.610 --> 02:45:22.590 line:82%
I love you and only you.

1809
02:45:25.150 --> 02:45:29.390 line:82%
In my every breath, my every heartbeat

1810
02:45:30.730 --> 02:45:33.320 line:82%
there is only you, Shalini.

1811
02:45:36.190 --> 02:45:38.780 line:82%
I'm sure I was born

1812
02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.390 line:82%
so that I could love you.

1813
02:45:42.820 --> 02:45:45.740 line:82%
And you were born to become mine.

1814
02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:48.290 line:82%
You are mine, Shalini.

1815
02:45:49.210 --> 02:45:51.370 line:82%
And if you ask your heart,

1816
02:45:52.090 --> 02:45:55.460 line:82%
you will know
I'm telling you the truth.

1817
02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:00.670 line:82%
Shalini!

1818
02:46:02.060 --> 02:46:04.930 line:82%
What's going on?
Who is this guy?

1819
02:46:05.020 --> 02:46:08.890 line:82%
I'll tell you.
This is Akash Malhotra.

1820
02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:11.270 line:82%
A. K. Malhotra's son.

1821
02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:13.710 line:82%
He's been wooing Shalini
for a long time now.

1822
02:46:14.670 --> 02:46:18.350 line:82%
I hit him once.
But I guess it wasn't enough.

1823
02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:21.850 line:82%
- I won't spare you today.
- Rohit!

1824
02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:23.860 line:82%
You'll do no such thing.

1825
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:26.390 line:82%
I want to speak to Shalini first.

1826
02:46:27.270 --> 02:46:28.580 line:82%
Shalini!

1827
02:46:55.430 --> 02:46:57.930 line:82%
- No, Rohit. Wait here.
- But, Dad, this is my life...

1828
02:46:58.020 --> 02:46:59.300 line:82%
Listen to me.

1829
02:48:16.890 --> 02:48:20.310 line:82%
Mahesh, I am very hurt today.

1830
02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:24.490 line:82%
I always considered Shalini
as my daughter.

1831
02:48:25.290 --> 02:48:28.820 line:82%
But now I see she never
thought of us as her own.

1832
02:48:30.470 --> 02:48:33.860 line:82%
She wants to repay her debt
to us by marrying Rohit.

1833
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.390 line:82%
That's fine.

1834
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:42.620 line:82%
Shalini, you must repay us

1835
02:48:44.540 --> 02:48:48.080 line:82%
for looking after you as a child.

1836
02:48:49.010 --> 02:48:52.160 line:82%
Pay us back for your every wish fulfilled.

1837
02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:56.200 line:82%
For shielding you

1838
02:48:56.291 --> 02:48:58.050 line:82%
from the slightest of problems.

1839
02:48:59.260 --> 02:49:01.470 line:82%
Now, if you want to repay us

1840
02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:03.890 line:82%
and see us happy,

1841
02:49:06.470 --> 02:49:07.910 line:82%
then you should marry Akash.

1842
02:49:14.650 --> 02:49:15.980 line:82%
Can you do this much for me?

1843
02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:25.540 line:82%
I love you, Dad.

1844
02:49:36.350 --> 02:49:37.720 line:82%
Come, dear.

1845
02:49:48.330 --> 02:49:50.070 line:82%
Take care of her.

1846
02:49:51.290 --> 02:49:52.310 line:82%
She's my daughter.

1847
02:50:27.930 --> 02:50:29.560 line:82%
Just a minute, Dad!

1848
02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:33.750 line:82%
You can't do this!
Mom, say something.

1849
02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:36.090 line:82%
Let her go, Rohit.

1850
02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:38.640 line:82%
What?

1851
02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:42.660 line:82%
You care about Shalini's happiness
but not mine.

1852
02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:44.190 line:82%
Rohit.

1853
02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:47.400 line:82%
If Shalini isn't happy with you

1854
02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:49.480 line:82%
how will you ever be happy?

1855
02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:50.980 line:82%
I don't care!

1856
02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:53.110 line:82%
This can't happen to me!

1857
02:50:54.890 --> 02:50:56.250 line:82%
This is so embarrassing!

1858
02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:58.110 line:82%
I won't let this happen.

1859
02:50:58.200 --> 02:50:59.910 line:82%
- Come here.
- Rohit!

1860
02:51:00.830 --> 02:51:02.130 line:82%
- Please...
- Come on... Leave me alone!

1861
02:51:03.730 --> 02:51:04.790 line:82%
Rohit!

1862
02:51:34.820 --> 02:51:36.120 line:82%
I'm sorry, Rohit.

1863
02:51:37.090 --> 02:51:41.160 line:82%
I love Akash.
Please understand.

1864
02:51:56.620 --> 02:51:58.430 line:82%
So, Akash, finally fell in love.

1865
02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:02.960 line:82%
He always said,
he'd never express his feelings.

1866
02:52:03.390 --> 02:52:04.740 line:82%
And when he had to,

1867
02:52:04.810 --> 02:52:07.320 line:82%
it was in front of 300 people
at a wedding ceremony.

1868
02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:13.120 line:82%
Have you called him?

1869
02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:15.780 line:82%
Yes.

1870
02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:17.910 line:82%
What did he say?

1871
02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:21.690 line:82%
He wasn't at home.

1872
02:52:27.250 --> 02:52:29.270 line:82%
I told you he wouldn't come.

1873
02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:18.980 line:82%
- Hello?
- Hello, Sameer.

1874
02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:21.340 line:82%
Hey, Akash.

1875
02:54:22.210 --> 02:54:25.990 line:82%
- May I speak to Sid?
- Just a second.

1876
02:54:31.950 --> 02:54:33.040 line:82%
It's Akash.

1877
02:54:40.190 --> 02:54:41.420 line:82%
Hello?

1878
02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:43.340 line:82%
Hi, Sid.

1879
02:54:46.100 --> 02:54:47.250 line:82%
How are you, buddy?

1880
02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:50.510 line:82%
I am fine. What about you?

1881
02:54:53.330 --> 02:54:54.980 line:82%
I am really sorry, Sid.

1882
02:54:57.180 --> 02:54:58.590 line:82%
Please forgive me.

1883
02:55:01.060 --> 02:55:03.000 line:82%
I should apologize, too.

1884
02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.800 line:82%
Some other day.
It's my turn today.

1885
02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:11.675 line:82%
You haven't changed at all.

1886
02:55:12.306 --> 02:55:13.400 line:82%
Yes.

1887
02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:16.310 line:82%
Anyway, it's hard
to improve on perfection.

1888
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:23.890 line:82%
Where are you? When can we meet?

1889
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:28.010 line:82%
Today. Now.

1890
02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:29.820 line:82%
Right away.

1891
02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:32.570 line:82%
Just turn around.

1892
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:57.960 line:82%
My buddy!

1893
02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:16.100 line:82%
Mr. Sinha.

1894
02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:02.390 line:82%
Siddharth.

1895
02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:08.650 line:82%
There's no more pain now

1896
02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:11.510 line:82%
nor any fear.

1897
02:57:15.890 --> 02:57:17.190 line:82%
I like it here.

1898
02:57:19.410 --> 02:57:20.770 line:82%
It's peaceful.

You're a great guy, Siddharth.

1900
02:57:31.380 --> 02:57:33.340 line:82%
You have always stood by me.

1901
02:57:37.770 --> 02:57:39.650 line:82%
You want me to be happy, don't you?

1902
02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:40.890 line:82%
Yes.

1903
02:57:43.260 --> 02:57:44.700 line:82%
Then... be happy.

1904
02:57:47.230 --> 02:57:49.300 line:82%
- You will, won't you?
- Yes.

1905
02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:01.560 line:82%
Life is so strange.

1906
02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:05.210 line:82%
Some relationships

1907
02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:10.070 line:82%
have no name.

1908
02:58:13.510 --> 02:58:14.830 line:82%
Siddharth.

1909
02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:18.620 line:82%
You and I will always...

1910
03:00:16.700 --> 03:00:17.740 line:82%
Hey, Sid.

There goes your ship.

1912
03:00:20.410 --> 03:00:23.040 line:82%
It was small two years ago,
now it has grown bigger.

1913
03:00:24.520 --> 03:00:25.790 line:82%
Excuse me!

1914
03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:29.300 line:82%
If you wanted to be alone,
you should have told us before.

1915
03:00:29.380 --> 03:00:31.340 line:82%
- Exactly!
- Let's just eat.

1916
03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:35.330 line:82%
Look, I'm getting ticked off
because of you two!

1917
03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:37.200 line:82%
- I've been telling you to move from here.
- What!

1918
03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:39.650 line:82%
- Let's go now.
- Akash, grow up...

1919
03:00:41.410 --> 03:00:42.580 line:82%
Hey, baby.

1920
03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:05.710 line:82%
Sid.

1921
03:01:06.900 --> 03:01:08.540 line:82%
- Come on.
- Sorry!

1922
03:01:57.840 --> 03:01:59.460 line:82%
The heart desires!

1923
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:04.260 line:82%
May these sparkling days never end

1924

The heart desires!

1925
03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:14.240 line:82%

03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:54.400 line:82%
May these sparkling days never end

1933
03:02:57.820 --> 03:02:59.440 line:82%
The heart desires!

1934
03:03:00.630 --> 03:03:04.410 line:82%
May we never part with friends

1935
03:03:07.770 --> 03:03:11.750 line:82%
Our glittering paths are dazzling

1936
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:16.750 line:82%

May this joy and light be ours by right

1939
03:03:47.850 --> 03:03:51.950 line:82%
Only when we friends reunited

1940
03:03:52.860 --> 03:03:56.960 line:82%
that we understood, and realized

1941
03:03:58.210 --> 03:04:04.510 line:82%
that we should always live
close to our friends

1942
03:04:08.260 --> 03:04:11.810 line:82%
May we never ever drift apart

1943
03:04:11.881 --> 03:04:15.360 line:82%
May we never ever drift apart

1944
03:04:17.890 --> 03:04:19.450 line:82%
The heart desires!

03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:24.400 line:82%
