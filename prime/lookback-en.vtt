I'm handing out this week's newspaper.

37
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:48.541 line:83%
Don't forget to show it to your parents.

38
00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.291 line:83%
The drawings are so good.

39
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.083 line:83%
Fujino, this week's four-panel
manga strips were really funny!

40
00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:06.541 line:83%
Oh, these.

41
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.625 line:83%
I was kind of busy this week,
so I drew it in five minutes.

42
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:13.916 line:83%
But I guess they turned out
pretty good despite that.

43
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.000 line:83%
You could be a manga artist
when you grow up.

44
00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:23.375 line:83%
A manga artist? Maybe.

45
00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:27.041 line:83%
But sitting at a desk

so why not be an athlete?

47
00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:33.125 line:83%
Yeah, that sounds better.

48
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.458 line:83%
Either way, give me your autograph.

49
00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:37.250 line:83%
Okay, fine.

50
00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:38.666 line:83%
I want one too!

52
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:43.583 line:83%

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:59.500 line:83%
She can't come to school,

59
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.416 line:83%
I mean, I guess I don't mind.

60
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.416 line:83%

would be difficult for an amateur.

come to school can handle it.

But, you know,

75
00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:17.375 line:83%
compared to Kyomoto's drawings,
yours look pretty average.

76
00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:35.291 line:83%
Fujino, how come
you're so good at drawing?

77
00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:40.041 line:83%
You have the best drawing skills
out of all my students.

78
00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:44.750 line:83%
You could become an artist
with these skills.

79

Compared to Kyomoto's drawings,
yours look pretty average.

80

I see.

81
00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:12.041 line:83%
Kyomoto must be practicing drawing
while I go to school.

82
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.041 line:83%

at drawing than me?

83
00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.208 line:83%

97

We'll be in middle school next year.
Are you still gonna draw then?

101
00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:39.333 line:83%
What?

102
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000 line:83%
Yeah.

103
00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.333 line:83%

104
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:46.041 line:83%
You know what?

105
00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:48.750 line:83%
Yosshi and Mihorin haven't
been able to tell you this either,

106
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.166 line:83%
but aren't you getting
too old to keep drawing?

107
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.916 line:83%
You don't hang out with us anymore.

108
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.791 line:83%

111

Well, I'd rather not, really.

I'll leave it here, okay?

169
00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:30.083 line:83%
Someone's home.

170
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.458 line:83%
Excuse me.

171
00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:41.541 line:83%
I brought your graduation diploma.

It's the world shut-in competition finals!

Wait...

180
00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:09.333 line:83%
No!

181

Hey...

Every week, I got... I got the newspaper.

187
00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:22.208 line:83%
I read your manga from the start,
since third grade.

188
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:25.208 line:83%
I... I...

189
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:29.625 line:83%
I'm a fan of yours, Fujino-sensei!

190
00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:31.625 line:83%
Can I have your autograph?

191
00:18:34.833 --> 00:18:36.750 line:83%
I don't have any paper!

192
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.916 line:83%
My back!

193
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.291 line:83%
Please sign the back of my jacket!

194
00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:47.916 line:83%
Sure.

195
00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:57.416 line:83%
My favorites are
Love Square
from the
second week of August in third grade,

196
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.333 line:83%
the
Sasaki
series you did
from January to March in fourth grade,

197
00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:07.125 line:83%
and every single one
from fifth and sixth grades was brilliant.

198
00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:10.041 line:83%
I couldn't always finish
my strips in time,

199
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.958 line:83%
but you did one every week
while attending school.

200
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:15.833 line:83%
I couldn't believe
you were a grade schooler like me.

201
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:20.625 line:83%
Your stories and drawings
kept getting better around fifth grade,

202
00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:22.375 line:83%
I was sure of it.

203
00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:26.250 line:83%
Fujino-sensei, you're a manga genius!

204
00:19:31.583 --> 00:19:33.500 line:83%
So, why...

205
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.583 line:83%
Why did you stop drawing your strips
in the middle of sixth grade?

206
00:19:41.708 --> 00:19:43.083 line:83%
Well, actually...

207
00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:47.083 line:83%
I'm trying to come up with a story
for a manga competition.

208
00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:50.000 line:83%
So basically,
I quit so that I could reach the next level.

209
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.958 line:83%
A manga competition?

210
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.416 line:83%
Amazing!

211
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.708 line:83%
I wanna see it! I totally wanna see it!
That's so amazing!

212
00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.458 line:83%
I wanna see! I wanna see!

213
00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:06.083 line:83%
Well, the idea's only in my head for now,

214
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.875 line:83%
but it's pretty much finished.

215
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.916 line:83%
Basically, all that's left
is to draw a draft and ink it.

216
00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:15.875 line:83%
I wanna see! I wanna see!

217
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.833 line:83%
Then, I guess I could show you
when it's done.

218
00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.958 line:83%
It's starting to rain. I should go.

219
00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.500 line:83%
See you.

220
00:20:38.541 --> 00:20:39.625 line:83%
See you.

Welcome back.

226
00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:40.125 line:83%
You're still here?
Wait, you finished the background already?

227
00:22:40.708 --> 00:22:43.500 line:83%
Yes. I don't go to school,
so it's a piece of cake.

228
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:48.666 line:83%
But it feels like we'll never
be able to finish all 45 pages.

229
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.208 line:83%
Yeah, and we've been drawing nonstop.

Amazing. I'm impressed.

233
00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:34.375 line:83%
But it took us an entire year
to finish it.

234
00:23:35.041 --> 00:23:37.333 line:83%
And she's done all the backgrounds.

235
00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:42.291 line:83%
No, no. Being able to finish a manga
as a middle school student is a feat.

236
00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:48.041 line:83%
The drawings and story
are both high quality.

To tell you the truth,
I was afraid to go out today.

263
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.541 line:83%
You see, I stopped going to school
because I was scared of people.

264

But I had a really good time today.

265
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:55.541 line:83%
I started drawing because
I had nothing to do at home.

266
00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:58.666 line:83%
But now I'm glad I did.

282
00:29:00.875 --> 00:29:03.375 line:83%
I want to go to art school.

So...

284
00:29:06.166 --> 00:29:07.125 line:83%

285

287
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.916 line:83%
Well, I guess it's fine.

288
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.416 line:83%
You only draw the backgrounds anyway.

289
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.458 line:83%
I can just get assistants to handle that.

290
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.000 line:83%
But there's no point
in going to art school.

291
00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:34.958 line:83%
I heard there are no job prospects
even with an art degree.

292
00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:36.708 line:83%
Yeah.

293
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.750 line:83%
I know...

294
00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:41.791 line:83%
And you'll have to talk
to lots of strangers, you know?

295
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:45.583 line:83%
I'll work on that.

296
00:29:47.916 --> 00:29:51.583 line:83%
If you just stick with me,
everything will work out.

297
00:29:58.125 --> 00:30:01.750 line:83%
I want to try living on my own,

298

299
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.583 line:83%
It'll be so boring! I guarantee you!

300
00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:11.083 line:83%
No, it won't!

301
00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:13.166 line:83%
It totally will be!

302
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.916 line:83%
Not to mention, there's no way
you can handle college life on your own!

303
00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:19.750 line:83%
I can! I will learn how!

304
00:30:19.833 --> 00:30:21.041 line:83%
You'll fail!

305
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:24.458 line:83%
You're too shy to even talk
to the cashier at the convenience store!

306
00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:26.291 line:83%
I'll practice.

307
00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:27.333 line:83%
You can't pull it off!

If our manga ever gets serialized,

341

I want the artwork

342
00:34:30.208 --> 00:34:32.750 line:83%

I drew this manga that day.

You stole my art!

396
00:42:45.208 --> 00:42:48.250 line:83%
I practice karate at the dojo

397

I was jogging

398
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:52.333 line:83%
when I saw this guy
going into campus with a weapon.

399
00:42:52.416 --> 00:42:54.083 line:83%
I knew he was trouble,

400
00:42:54.166 --> 00:42:58.083 line:83%
so I ran after him and when I gave him
a karate kick, I fell and broke my leg.

401
00:42:58.166 --> 00:42:59.541 line:83%
Pretty lame, isn't it?

402
00:43:04.708 --> 00:43:06.708 line:83%
Thank you very much.

403
00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:10.541 line:83%

Are you Fujino-sensei by any chance?

409
00:43:28.416 --> 00:43:29.583 line:83%
Sensei?

410
00:43:29.666 --> 00:43:31.208 line:83%
When you were in grade school,

411
00:43:31.291 --> 00:43:34.541 line:83%
did you draw four-panel manga strips
for the school newspaper?

412
00:43:35.125 --> 00:43:38.000 line:83%
Yeah, I did, now that you mention it.

413
00:43:38.083 --> 00:43:39.541 line:83%
It really is you!

414
00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:42.208 line:83%
I was a fan of your four-panel manga.

415
00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:45.666 line:83%
What a coincidence, right?

416

Thanks.

417
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.666 line:83%
Sorry, but it's time to go.

418
00:43:56.458 --> 00:44:00.208 line:83%
Why did you quit drawing manga?

419
00:44:06.125 --> 00:44:08.625 line:83%
I recently started drawing again.

420
00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:11.250 line:83%
