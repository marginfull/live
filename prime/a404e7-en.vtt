Material.

328
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.500 line:82%
What even is "promotional matrimony"?

"How could they increase the tuition?"
It's about tuition.

349
00:18:22.066 --> 00:18:25.100 line:82%
PLEASE KEEP YOUR PROMISE
ABOUT CUTTING TUITION IN HALF!

350
00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:28.233 line:82%
The six university representatives
of the Korea College Students' Union

351
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.233 line:82%
held a press conference
at Gwanghwamun Square

352
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.567 line:82%
and asked the government to keep
its promise of cutting tuition in half.

353
00:18:33.633 --> 00:18:36.000 line:82%
The attendees criticized the government

354
00:18:36.066 --> 00:18:38.333 line:82%
for tormenting the students
with high tuition.

355
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.500 line:82%
That's right. While movies and songs
were incredibly popular back then,

356
00:18:43.567 --> 00:18:47.333 line:82%
there was a social conflict
over the issue of half-price tuition.

357
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.800 line:82%
Tuition was an issue. That's right.

358
00:18:50.533 --> 00:18:52.567 line:82%
-Tuition.
-For students…

359
00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:55.533 line:82%
-Yes.
-For students, tuition is daunting.

360
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.633 line:82%
-It's expensive.
-Parents struggled.

361
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.166 line:82%
Let's go inside.

362
00:18:59.233 --> 00:19:00.233 line:82%

-Okay.

363
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.667 line:82%
-This university seems to have a problem.
-I know.

364
00:19:02.734 --> 00:19:04.934 line:82%
Every place we visit has a problem.

365
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.500 line:82%
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

366
00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:08.333 line:82%
Woo-il, you're handsome.

367
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.100 line:82%
Thank you. I hear that a lot.

368
00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:12.367 line:82%
I'm sick and tired of it.

-What?
-Look at them.

379
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.100 line:82%
He was wearing that jacket.

380
00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.500 line:82%
The police.

381
00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:01.867 line:82%
You serial robbing punk…

382

-A serial robber?
-A serial robber.

383

He got arrested.

389
00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:23.133 line:82%
They were wearing the same jacket

Jae-seok, send a reply. Write something.

-Jae-seok.
-"Answer me, freshman."

408

410
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.900 line:82%
-Shall I type?
-What are you doing? What did you type?

411
00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:42.100 line:82%
The hunt-and-peck typing

424
00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:14.000 line:82%
"No, you're not." You got caught.

425
00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:17.567 line:82%
Maybe a freshman among us should type.

426
00:22:17.633 --> 00:22:18.533 line:82%
Se-chan, go ahead.

427
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.633 line:82%

00:22:34.834 --> 00:22:36.800 line:82%
-I should practice typing.
-What?

435
00:22:36.867 --> 00:22:38.500 line:82%
-You're busy already.
-You should.

436
00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:39.567 line:82%
I should practice typing.

437
00:22:39.633 --> 00:22:42.967 line:82%
What if I get arrested
for revealing my name?

438
00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:44.834 line:82%
-He left.
-He left.

439
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.633 line:82%
-The name is Kim Kwang-won.
-He left.

440
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.400 line:82%
-Leader Kim Kwang-won.
-Kim Kwang-won?

441
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.867 line:82%
He was wearing that jacket.

442
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.133 line:82%
Leader Kim Kwang-won
must be up to something.

443
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.934 line:82%
What's this? Is it a crime ring?

444
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.400 line:82%
It must be a crime ring. The freshman.

445
00:23:07.967 --> 00:23:09.934 line:82%

Don't suspect me because of my outfit.
It isn't me.

448

What's the story?

449
00:23:16.734 --> 00:23:19.133 line:82%

Which Is Twice the Inflation Rate."

467
00:24:18.133 --> 00:24:20.266 line:82%
Is there a story about tuition?

It's about tuition.

472

You serial robbing punk,
you should've stopped already.

473

What's this?

474
00:24:39.533 --> 00:24:40.633 line:82%
-Someone's at the door.
-A clue…

475
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.900 line:82%
What?

476
00:24:45.433 --> 00:24:46.333 line:82%
What?

477
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.600 line:82%
What?

478
00:24:49.166 --> 00:24:50.467 line:82%
-What?
-Aiki.

479
00:24:50.533 --> 00:24:53.333 line:82%
-It's Aiki.
-Aiki. What are you doing?

480
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.000 line:82%
-What are you doing? You just got here.
-Seriously.

481
00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:00.066 line:82%
You just got here.

-Aiki.
-You just got here.

483
00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:03.567 line:82%
Hello.

484
00:25:04.367 --> 00:25:07.033 line:82%
Aiki, why are you wearing shoes
when we took off ours?

485
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.467 line:82%
-Gosh, this is…
-Wow.

486
00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:13.934 line:82%
It's too much.

487
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.567 line:82%
-You didn't even say hi.
-She's freestyling.

488
00:25:21.767 --> 00:25:23.700 line:82%
-Oh, my god.
-She's good.

489
00:25:23.767 --> 00:25:25.200 line:82%
-She's so good.
-She's good.

490
00:25:25.266 --> 00:25:26.667 line:82%
-Hi.
-Hello.

491
00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:29.367 line:82%
Hi. Welcome to the Dance Club.

492
00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:31.934 line:82%
I'm a junior and also the best dancer.

493
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.233 line:82%
My name is Hye-in.

494
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.600 line:82%
-What?
-Hye-in?

495
00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.233 line:82%
-Hye-eun?
-Hye-in.

496
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.834 line:82%
-Hye-in.
-Hye-in.

497
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.200 line:82%
You brought back memories.

498
00:25:41.266 --> 00:25:43.567 line:82%
-What?
-Song Eun-i was like her back in school.

499
00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:48.000 line:82%
Seriously. Song Eun-i looked
exactly like her.

500
00:25:48.066 --> 00:25:49.600 line:82%
She just needs tinted glasses.

501
00:25:49.667 --> 00:25:52.533 line:82%
-Song Eun-i.
-They do look similar.

502
00:25:53.133 --> 00:25:55.433 line:82%
She practically dressed up as Song Eun-i.

503
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.000 line:82%
-Senior Song.
-Song Eun-i. Senior Song.

504
00:26:00.967 --> 00:26:02.600 line:82%
What are we supposed to do?

505
00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:05.233 line:82%
You joined because you were interested
in dancing.

506
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.100 line:82%
-Of course.
-That's right.

507
00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:10.734 line:82%
Let's get started.

508
00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:15.166 line:82%
We need to perform.

509
00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:16.333 line:82%
-What?
-What?

510
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.533 line:82%
You want me to perform in this state?

511
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.133 line:82%
Would you be okay with that?

512
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.600 line:82%
-I already made up my mind.
-Okay.

513
00:26:22.667 --> 00:26:24.800 line:82%
We'll give a performance
of the hottest song,

514
00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:27.133 line:82%
"Heartbeat" by 2PM.

515
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.633 line:82%
-"Heartbeat."
-Can you feel my heartbeat?

516
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.066 line:82%
-I called over some seniors.
-Really?

517
00:26:44.133 --> 00:26:46.000 line:82%
-Seniors.
-It'd be funny

518
00:26:46.066 --> 00:26:47.266 line:82%
-if 2PM came.
-The best dancers.

519
00:26:49.467 --> 00:26:52.133 line:82%
Welcome.

520
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.533 line:82%
-They're here.
-What?

521
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.934 line:82%
-Earlier, they were with the Hip-Hop Club.
-Didn't they do hip-hop?

522
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.600 line:82%
He was rapping terribly earlier.

523
00:27:00.667 --> 00:27:02.600 line:82%
Find freedom at Nakwon University.

524
00:27:10.433 --> 00:27:12.800 line:82%
Here comes the first move.

525
00:27:12.867 --> 00:27:14.166 line:82%
Pound your chest.

526
00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:18.100 line:82%
This dance is very well-known.

527
00:27:19.834 --> 00:27:21.800 line:82%
Pound your chest. The second move.

528
00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:23.000 line:82%
Run plaintively.

529
00:27:23.066 --> 00:27:25.500 line:82%
That's right. You need to act like
you're going somewhere.

530
00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:27.667 line:82%
Run like this.

531
00:27:27.734 --> 00:27:30.033 line:82%
Run.

532
00:27:30.667 --> 00:27:33.467 line:82%
Are you doing the grasshopper dance?
That's what it looks like.

533
00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:34.600 line:82%
I've seen it somewhere.

534
00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:37.567 line:82%
-I got it.
-Good.

535
00:27:37.633 --> 00:27:39.033 line:82%
JENNIE, we'll dance behind you.

536
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.133 line:82%
Okay.

537
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.266 line:82%
Become self-absorbed.

538
00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:46.033 line:82%
Let's go.

539
00:27:52.834 --> 00:27:57.033 line:82%
Move to the side. Pretend to be a zombie.

540
00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.200 line:82%
It's this way.

541
00:27:58.266 --> 00:28:00.166 line:82%
-You didn't teach us this move.
-This move.

542
00:28:00.233 --> 00:28:02.367 line:82%
-You didn't teach us this move.
-This move.

543
00:28:02.433 --> 00:28:04.033 line:82%
How are we supposed to dance?

544
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.300 line:82%
-Here it comes.
-Here it comes.

545
00:28:05.367 --> 00:28:07.200 line:82%
-Run. Let's go.
-Here it comes.

546
00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:08.967 line:82%
How cool.

547
00:28:13.967 --> 00:28:15.033 line:82%
Se-chan.

548
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.533 line:82%
Now, show us 2PM.

549
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.734 line:82%
That was perfect.

550
00:28:27.867 --> 00:28:31.000 line:82%
You need to succeed in doing
the human pyramid

551
00:28:31.066 --> 00:28:33.333 line:82%
for us to give a good performance.

552
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.500 line:82%
Okay.

553
00:28:34.567 --> 00:28:36.166 line:82%
What a puzzling day.

554
00:28:36.233 --> 00:28:38.100 line:82%
-There must be something more.
-I know.

555
00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:39.133 line:82%
What's this?

556
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.767 line:82%
-Now, the saddle position.
-The human pyramid.

557
00:28:43.567 --> 00:28:45.567 line:82%
-Let's see the human pyramid.
-Hey.

558
00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:47.800 line:82%
-Let's see the human pyramid.
-Hey.

559
00:28:53.633 --> 00:28:55.600 line:82%
-It was perfect.
-It was perfect.

560
00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:57.066 line:82%
-It was perfect.
-It was perfect.

561
00:28:57.133 --> 00:28:57.967 line:82%
It was perfect, right?

562
00:28:58.033 --> 00:29:00.300 line:82%
What was the meaning of that?

563
00:29:00.367 --> 00:29:03.100 line:82%
I'm sure the human pyramid
means something.

564
00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:05.400 line:82%
I think so.

565
00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:08.533 line:82%
-You hear the sound.
-Yes, we do.

566
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.567 line:82%
Yes. My body is twitching already.

567
00:29:33.567 --> 00:29:34.433 line:82%
That's right.

568
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.767 line:82%
-Aren't they the DICKPUNKS?
-From
Superstar K?

569
00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:41.100 line:82%
-Who are you guys?
-Hello.

570
00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:44.133 line:82%
-We're the Band Club.
-The Band Club, N.O.B.

571
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.900 line:82%
N.O.B?

572
00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:48.934 line:82%
It stands for Nakwon's only band.

573
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.300 line:82%
We're preparing to enter
Superstar K
.

574
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.834 line:82%
Guys,

575
00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:00.133 line:82%
you'll win if you change the band name.

576
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.700 line:82%
Finally…

577
00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:04.900 line:82%
Hello. We're DICKPUNKS.

578
00:30:04.967 --> 00:30:06.433 line:82%
"DIFUNKS."

579
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.033 line:82%
DICKPUNKS.

580
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.166 line:82%
Thus, they celebrated passing
the audition.

581
00:30:13.734 --> 00:30:18.100 line:82%
If you want to join the Band Club,
we need to test your skills.

582
00:30:18.166 --> 00:30:20.033 line:82%
-That sounds good.
-Will you test our skills?

583
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.867 line:82%
By the way, you have the same name as me.

584
00:30:22.934 --> 00:30:24.000 line:82%
Oh, yes.

585
00:30:24.066 --> 00:30:25.734 line:82%
Tae-hyun can sing well.

586
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.066 line:82%
-That's right.
-Yes.

587
00:30:27.133 --> 00:30:30.433 line:82%
Tae-hyun, do you know a song titled
"The Two Line Bridge"?

588
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.734 line:82%
…do you know a song titled
"The Two Line Bridge"?

589
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.700 line:82%
I've heard of it.

590
00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:36.967 line:82%
I have a feeling
that you'll sing that song well.

591
00:30:37.033 --> 00:30:38.734 line:82%
I'm getting that same feeling.

592
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.100 line:82%
-Come here and sing.
-Thank you.

593
00:30:42.166 --> 00:30:43.700 line:82%
I have a bad cold,

594
00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:46.000 line:82%
-but I'll give it a go.
-What's that?

595
00:30:46.066 --> 00:30:48.400 line:82%
Is that a prompter?
Do you have bad eyesight?

596
00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:50.400 line:82%
Those are the lyrics.

597
00:30:50.467 --> 00:30:53.667 line:82%
All right. This is an honor.

598
00:31:00.166 --> 00:31:03.033 line:82%
What? It isn't trot music.

599
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.800 line:82%
It's rock.

600
00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.333 line:82%
One, two, one, two, three, four.

601
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.100 line:82%
The last farewell on the two line bridge

602
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:17.066 line:82%
He's cool.

603
00:31:17.133 --> 00:31:21.900 line:82%
-
The passing wind makes my heart ache
-He's cool.

604
00:31:22.467 --> 00:31:26.934 line:82%
-
I stand there without asking you to stay
-He's good.

605
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.667 line:82%
He's good.

606
00:31:28.734 --> 00:31:31.400 line:82%
I stand there alone

607
00:31:31.467 --> 00:31:32.900 line:82%
That's good.

608
00:31:32.967 --> 00:31:35.600 line:82%
I turn around multiple times

609
00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:39.367 line:82%
In order to look at you

610
00:31:39.433 --> 00:31:43.700 line:82%
But I'm a fool who can't ask you to stay

611
00:31:43.767 --> 00:31:49.500 line:82%
Standing at either end
Of the two line bridge

612
00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:54.400 line:82%
We call for each other

613
00:31:54.467 --> 00:31:56.100 line:82%
-What do you think?
-He's good.

614
00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:57.967 line:82%
-He is?
-He's in.

615
00:31:58.033 --> 00:32:00.934 line:82%
My heart aches

616
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.500 line:82%
Our love

617
00:32:03.567 --> 00:32:10.300 line:82%
Can't be realized

618
00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:14.233 line:82%
Thank you.

619
00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:17.166 line:82%
Thank you.

620
00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:19.033 line:82%
-You're good.
-My goodness.

621
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.166 line:82%
You can sing well.

622
00:32:21.734 --> 00:32:22.800 line:82%
Did I pass?

623
00:32:22.867 --> 00:32:26.066 line:82%
Join the band as a vocalist.

624
00:32:26.133 --> 00:32:28.433 line:82%
-I didn't like it.
-Why not?

625
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.500 line:82%
His vibrato was too old-fashioned.

626
00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:34.600 line:82%
His vocals do sound old.

00:47:28.567 --> 00:47:30.333 line:82%
-Where are the students?
-Where are they?

945
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.867 line:82%
-That startled me.
-What?

946
00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:34.567 line:82%
-Where are the students?
-Where are they?

947
00:47:34.633 --> 00:47:35.834 line:82%
-That startled me.
-What?

948
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.800 line:82%
-Where are they?
-Where are they?

949
00:47:36.867 --> 00:47:37.700 line:82%
Where are they?

950
00:47:40.934 --> 00:47:41.767 line:82%
What?

951
00:47:44.367 --> 00:47:45.667 line:82%
Where did they go?

952
00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:47.600 line:82%
-There's no door.
-When…

953
00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:49.734 line:82%
-Where are they?
-There's no door.

954
00:47:53.467 --> 00:47:55.433 line:82%
-Where did they go?
-What?

955
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.266 line:82%
-Where did they go?
-Where did they go?

956
00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:59.700 line:82%
-I can't believe it.
-No way. When did they disappear?

957
00:47:59.767 --> 00:48:02.333 line:82%
-Why does the scale keep getting bigger?
-What?

958
00:48:04.166 --> 00:48:05.367 line:82%
No way.

959
00:48:12.533 --> 00:48:13.667 line:82%
No way.

960
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.200 line:82%
-Is this magic?
-Where did they go?

961
00:48:18.967 --> 00:48:20.767 line:82%
-Where did they go?
-My goodness.

962
00:48:20.834 --> 00:48:23.166 line:82%
Art, Photography, and Gardening?

963
00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:25.166 line:82%
What was the missing information?

964
00:48:25.233 --> 00:48:27.467 line:82%
Since last November, Mr. Jung…

965
00:48:27.533 --> 00:48:30.033 line:82%
After losing ten million won
and squandering the rest,

966
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.900 line:82%
he turned to crime.

967
00:48:31.967 --> 00:48:35.734 line:82%
What was the reason why
he lost ten million won?

968
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.934 line:82%
-Did he gamble?
-That could be the case.

969
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.200 line:82%
We should go to those club rooms.

970
00:48:40.266 --> 00:48:41.533 line:82%
My goodness.

971
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.433 line:82%
Art, Photography, and Gardening.

972
00:48:45.867 --> 00:48:47.800 line:82%
Shall we check out the clue?

973
00:48:47.867 --> 00:48:50.233 line:82%
Yes, let's check out the clue. Is this it?

974
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.567 line:82%
-Here.
-Is there a clue inside?

975
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.467 line:82%
"Check out the club rooms: Art Club,
Photography Club, and Gardening Club."

976
00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.567 line:82%
Art, Photography, and Gardening.

977
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.100 line:82%
-Now?
-Shall we check them out first?

978
00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:03.533 line:82%
-Let's do that.
-Let's go.

979
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.100 line:82%
The other team
must've gotten a better clue.

980
00:49:10.166 --> 00:49:11.133 line:82%
That's right.

981
00:49:11.967 --> 00:49:13.800 line:82%
Art Club, Photography Club…

982
00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:16.333 line:82%
-Here's the Art Club.
-Art Club.

983
00:49:19.433 --> 00:49:20.600 line:82%
Let's go inside.

984
00:49:22.233 --> 00:49:24.734 line:82%
-They're painting something.
-She's the senior we saw earlier.

985
00:49:34.934 --> 00:49:37.100 line:82%
Guys. Have you seen Min-su?

986
00:49:37.166 --> 00:49:40.567 line:82%
Why are you painting the canvas black?
What are you painting?

987
00:49:43.433 --> 00:49:44.433 line:82%
My future.

988
00:49:45.166 --> 00:49:46.500 line:82%
-What?
-What did she say?

989
00:49:46.567 --> 00:49:48.133 line:82%
She's painting her future.

990
00:49:49.433 --> 00:49:50.834 line:82%
She's painting her future.

991
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.133 line:82%
Is there only this bit of hope?

992
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.500 line:82%
-We have to finish it by today.
-You have to finish it by today?

993
00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:02.100 line:82%
They have to finish it by today.

994
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:03.567 line:82%
Her future.

995
00:50:04.066 --> 00:50:06.834 line:82%
They have to finish it by today.
What do they need to finish?

996
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.433 line:82%
Look at these.

997
00:50:10.533 --> 00:50:11.500 line:82%
They're all dark.

998
00:50:12.066 --> 00:50:13.533 line:82%
-They're black.
-They're black.

999
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.300 line:82%
-Is this a puzzle?
-Seriously.

1000
00:50:19.333 --> 00:50:21.433 line:82%
How do we put them together?

1001
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.900 line:82%
The paintings…

1002
00:50:22.967 --> 00:50:25.633 line:82%
One is entirely black.
One was painted diagonally.

1003
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:26.834 line:82%
Why are they different?

1004
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.734 line:82%
I'm really bad at things like this.
My brain doesn't work.

1005
00:50:31.433 --> 00:50:32.900 line:82%
-Photography Club.
-Right.

1006
00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.967 line:82%
Art, Photography, Gardening.

1007
00:50:35.033 --> 00:50:36.734 line:82%
The Dance Club is coming.

1008
00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:38.734 line:82%
What should we do?

1009
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.100 line:82%
We didn't figure anything out.

1010
00:50:43.734 --> 00:50:45.367 line:82%
What's in there?

1011
00:50:50.133 --> 00:50:51.667 line:82%
There are people inside.

1012
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.967 line:82%
-Photography Club.
-Jae-seok, Photography Club.

1013
00:51:02.533 --> 00:51:04.100 line:82%
Art, Photography, Gardening.

1014
00:51:19.467 --> 00:51:21.734 line:82%
Shall we find the clue?

1015
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.000 line:82%
Back then… Yes. DSLR.

1016
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.200 line:82%
Back then, phone photos
weren't high-resolution like they are now.

1017
00:51:30.266 --> 00:51:31.367 line:82%
That's right.

1018
00:51:31.433 --> 00:51:33.000 line:82%
Back then, people carried cameras.

1019
00:51:33.867 --> 00:51:35.266 line:82%
DSLR.

1020
00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.700 line:82%
Photos.

1021
00:51:39.467 --> 00:51:42.033 line:82%
Jae-seok, the photos must mean something.

1022
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.400 line:82%
What could they mean?

1023
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.600 line:82%
Photos or drawings usually contain clues.

1024
00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:47.834 line:82%
Yes.

1025
00:51:53.233 --> 00:51:55.533 line:82%
Cat. Tiger.

1026
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.700 line:82%
Animals.

1027
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.600 line:82%
It's a photo of the Louvre Museum.

1028
00:52:06.433 --> 00:52:07.767 line:82%
The Louvre.

1029
00:52:08.333 --> 00:52:10.900 line:82%
-That's the Eiffel Tower.
-Paris.

1030
00:52:10.967 --> 00:52:14.300 line:82%
-I see a lot of French scenery.
-France.

1031
00:52:18.734 --> 00:52:20.400 line:82%
-Let's visit other club rooms too.
-Okay.

1032
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.567 line:82%
-Why the photo of the Louvre?
-Good question.

1033
00:52:23.633 --> 00:52:26.100 line:82%
-Why the photos of Europe?
-Paris.

1034
00:52:32.934 --> 00:52:34.867 line:82%
There are animal photos.

1035
00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:36.967 line:82%
Three dogs.

1036
00:52:37.033 --> 00:52:39.000 line:82%
The Louvre.

1037
00:52:39.567 --> 00:52:41.633 line:82%
What's this photo?

1038
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.533 line:82%
What is it?

1039
00:52:46.166 --> 00:52:49.900 line:82%
Am I stupid?
Why can't I figure anything out?

1040
00:52:49.967 --> 00:52:51.233 line:82%
Let's go to the room next door.

1041
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.767 line:82%
We'll be able to find
the common denominator.

1042
00:53:00.767 --> 00:53:01.767 line:82%
Gardening Club.

1043
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.300 line:82%
This room is full of greenery.

1044
00:53:15.467 --> 00:53:17.333 line:82%
Na-ra, the blueberry juice looks good.

1045
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.333 line:82%
-What is it?
-I don't know. Can we drink it?

1046
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.467 line:82%
The blueberry juice is out of place.

1047
00:53:29.934 --> 00:53:32.367 line:82%
This room has nothing in common
with the other rooms.

1048
00:53:32.433 --> 00:53:33.533 line:82%
-It's here.
-Here.

1049
00:53:35.834 --> 00:53:38.367 line:82%
What? There are students inside.

1050
00:53:38.867 --> 00:53:39.934 line:82%
What? Why…

1051
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.900 line:82%
What could these be?

1052
00:53:47.467 --> 00:53:48.767 line:82%
There are numbers.

1053
00:53:52.567 --> 00:53:54.300 line:82%
There are so many.

1054
00:53:54.867 --> 00:53:55.867 line:82%
This is number 17.

1055
00:53:55.934 --> 00:53:57.233 line:82%
Jae-seok, let's take all of them.

1056
00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.200 line:82%
-Yes.
-We should take all of them.

1057
00:54:00.867 --> 00:54:03.467 line:82%
What? I think the students
are making similar paintings.

1058
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.900 line:82%
They're painting the paper black.

1059
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.333 line:82%
Shall we go somewhere more spacious
and put these together?

1060
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.400 line:82%
-Shall we do that?
-Yes.

1061
00:54:11.467 --> 00:54:12.967 line:82%
Let's look for a hint.

1062
00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:21.033 line:82%
Jae-seok, this is number one.

1063
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.266 line:82%
-Number two.
-Number two.

1064
00:54:22.333 --> 00:54:24.033 line:82%
-Which way should I lay it?
-Hold on.

1065
00:54:24.533 --> 00:54:25.633 line:82%
Here.

1066
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.200 line:82%
-Number three.
-It's missing.

1067
00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:31.166 line:82%
Number 13.

1068
00:54:31.734 --> 00:54:32.900 line:82%
-Twenty-two--
-Here's number three.

1069
00:54:32.967 --> 00:54:33.967 line:82%
Give me number three.

1070
00:54:34.033 --> 00:54:36.533 line:82%
-What?
-Jae-seok, this is it.

1071
00:54:39.433 --> 00:54:40.767 line:82%
It's a triangle.

1072
00:54:41.333 --> 00:54:43.300 line:82%
Why am I always clueless?

1073
00:54:44.133 --> 00:54:45.800 line:82%
What are we supposed to look at?

1074
00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:49.000 line:82%
A triangle.

1075
00:54:51.567 --> 00:54:52.934 line:82%
A triangle.

1076
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.367 line:82%
-You're right.
-A Triangle.

1077
00:54:57.367 --> 00:54:58.900 line:82%
-It's that way.
-That way.

1078
00:54:59.467 --> 00:55:01.233 line:82%
There should be another one in the middle.

1079
00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:04.300 line:82%
What case is related to triangles?

1080
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.667 line:82%
-You're right.
-A triangle.

1081
00:55:13.133 --> 00:55:15.767 line:82%
A case that's related to triangles.

1082
00:55:16.266 --> 00:55:17.533 line:82%
-Here.
-That's right.

1083
00:55:19.333 --> 00:55:20.400 line:82%
Here.

1084
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.467 line:82%
Having run out of money,

1085
00:55:22.533 --> 00:55:25.233 line:82%
they hit a drunken man in his fifties
and stole his wallet

1086
00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.467 line:82%
in the early morning hours of December 31

1087
00:55:27.533 --> 00:55:29.133 line:82%
in Bongcheon-dong.

1088
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.567 line:82%
"How big is the harvest?"

1089
00:55:37.166 --> 00:55:38.800 line:82%
"How big is the harvest?"

1090
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.533 line:82%
-I know what it is.
-What?

1091
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.867 line:82%
A pyramid.

1092
00:55:46.433 --> 00:55:48.367 line:82%
-A pyramid? No way.
-A pyramid.

1093
00:55:48.967 --> 00:55:51.467 line:82%
-A pyramid.
-It's a pyramid.

1094
00:55:51.967 --> 00:55:54.400 line:82%
A case that's related to triangles.

1095
00:55:54.467 --> 00:55:56.367 line:82%
-A pyramid.
-A pyramid.

1096
00:55:56.433 --> 00:55:58.600 line:82%
-It must be a pyramid.
-A pyramid case.

1097
00:55:59.166 --> 00:56:00.967 line:82%
-Pyramid scheme.
-You're right.

1098
00:56:06.767 --> 00:56:08.834 line:82%
Come to think of it,

1099
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.934 line:82%
Nakwon University's symbol is a pyramid.

1100
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.734 line:82%
You're right. The school symbol.

1101
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.834 line:82%
-The school symbol is a pyramid.
-The symbol.

1102
00:56:16.266 --> 00:56:17.266 line:82%
That's incredible.

1103
00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:18.800 line:82%
It's a pyramid.

1104
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.033 line:82%
Is "pyramid scheme" today's key word?

1105
00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.266 line:82%
I think I vaguely remember
a case involving students.

1106
00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:27.900 line:82%
Their family members gave information
to news outlets and whatnot.

1107
00:56:27.967 --> 00:56:29.867 line:82%
With the new school year upon us,

1108
00:56:29.934 --> 00:56:33.800 line:82%
illegal pyramid schemes targeting
college students are becoming prevalent.

1109
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.133 line:82%
The blueberry juice looks good.

1110
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.233 line:82%
The blueberry juice is out of place.

1111
00:56:38.834 --> 00:56:42.166 line:82%
Health food items were sold
at ten times the production cost.

1112
00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:44.934 line:82%
I looked for a job in order to earn money.

1113
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.734 line:82%
They said I could make
ten million won a month.

1114
00:56:48.233 --> 00:56:50.233 line:82%
There are handwritten posters.

1115
00:56:51.467 --> 00:56:54.900 line:82%
-"My blood is boiling."
-"How could they increase the tuition?"

1116
00:56:54.967 --> 00:56:56.166 line:82%
PYRAMID

1117
00:56:56.233 --> 00:56:58.600 line:82%
College students who joined
a company running a pyramid scheme

1118
00:56:58.667 --> 00:57:02.166 line:82%
turned to robbery
when they couldn't meet the quota.

1119
00:57:05.934 --> 00:57:07.967 line:82%
You serial robbing punk…

1120
00:57:08.033 --> 00:57:10.166 line:82%
-He's a culprit.
-"Serial robbing punk."

1121
00:57:11.033 --> 00:57:13.500 line:82%
I went there thinking
that it was a job fair.

1122
00:57:13.567 --> 00:57:15.600 line:82%
They drew a pyramid and said…

1123
00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:17.333 line:82%
-
Do.
-
Do.

1124
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.066 line:82%
-
Mi.
-
Mi.

1125
00:57:19.133 --> 00:57:20.800 line:82%
-
La.
-
La.

1126
00:57:21.367 --> 00:57:22.800 line:82%
Fi.

1127
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.100 line:82%
What are they doing? A flash mob?

1128
00:57:30.767 --> 00:57:31.867 line:82%
The shape of the Louvre.

1129
00:57:31.934 --> 00:57:33.867 line:82%
-The Louvre Pyramid.
-Pyramid.

1130
00:57:33.934 --> 00:57:35.000 line:82%
I see.

1131
00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.400 line:82%
There's a photo of a vanishing point.

1132
00:57:43.934 --> 00:57:47.266 line:82%
We know the pyramid scheme has a leader.

1133
00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:49.000 line:82%
That's right.

1134
00:57:49.066 --> 00:57:50.767 line:82%
-We need to find Min-su.
-Min-su.

1135
00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:53.233 line:82%
Min-su. That's right.

1136
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.734 line:82%
Let's put these away.

1137
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.333 line:82%
Find Min-su.

1138
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.533 line:82%
What's going on today?

1139
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.367 line:82%
-Did you find anything?
-Why didn't you go to eat?

1140
00:58:02.433 --> 00:58:04.000 line:82%
-Is it a packed lunch?
-Gimbap.

1141
00:58:04.066 --> 00:58:05.433 line:82%
I see. That sounds good.

1142
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.700 line:82%
It contains protein.

1143
00:58:06.767 --> 00:58:08.533 line:82%
It's nice. It isn't half bad.

1144
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.333 line:82%
Did you find anything?

1145
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.367 line:82%
Find what?

1146
00:58:11.433 --> 00:58:14.033 line:82%
-I don't know anything.
-Your shoulders tell me that you do.

1147
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.667 line:82%
-Do my shoulders hold a clue?
-Your shoulders. Lend them to me later.

1148
00:58:17.734 --> 00:58:19.100 line:82%
Do my shoulders hold a clue?

1149
00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:22.934 line:82%
Which one of us is it today?

1150
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.133 line:82%
There's something, right?

1151
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.533 line:82%
We don't know if a spy is among us or not.

1152
00:58:27.867 --> 00:58:29.233 line:82%
-What?
-It's a cafeteria.

1153
00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:31.533 line:82%
It is. I bet it'll be great.

1154
00:58:44.767 --> 00:58:46.300 line:82%
Cafeteria.

1155
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.700 line:82%
What about us?

1156
00:58:52.266 --> 00:58:54.700 line:82%
-I love cafeterias.
-I see.

1157
00:58:54.767 --> 00:58:56.567 line:82%
-I'm a huge fan. What?
-What?

1158
00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.100 line:82%
What? What is it?

1159
00:59:02.867 --> 00:59:03.800 line:82%
Peeakaboo.

1160
00:59:03.867 --> 00:59:05.667 line:82%
-What? My goodness.
-What?

1161
00:59:05.734 --> 00:59:07.500 line:82%
Just how much do they pay you?

1162
00:59:07.567 --> 00:59:09.533 line:82%
Woo-il, are you trying to get rich?

1163
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.367 line:82%
Woo-il is here again?

1164
00:59:11.433 --> 00:59:14.567 line:82%
Does Woo-il get paid per scene?

1165
00:59:16.333 --> 00:59:18.133 line:82%
Who is he this time? Auntie Woo-il?

1166
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.367 line:82%
Woo-il.

1167
00:59:19.433 --> 00:59:22.100 line:82%
-It isn't easy to make a living.
-Auntie Woo-il.

1168
00:59:22.166 --> 00:59:24.867 line:82%
You're like a chameleon.

1169
00:59:24.934 --> 00:59:27.066 line:82%
-Put your meal ticket here.
-Okay.

1170
00:59:27.133 --> 00:59:29.667 line:82%
-I feel like I'm at school.
-I know.

1171
00:59:33.533 --> 00:59:34.767 line:82%
It's stir-fried pork.

1172
00:59:35.467 --> 00:59:37.100 line:82%
This kimchi looks delicious.

1173
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.834 line:82%
Gosh, this is great. There's rice.

1174
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.700 line:82%
I'll put the stir-fried pork over rice.

1175
00:59:46.767 --> 00:59:48.533 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the food.

1176
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.600 line:82%
I'll enjoy the food.

1177
00:59:49.667 --> 00:59:51.834 line:82%
-I haven't had this milk in a while.
-Take one.

1178
00:59:52.867 --> 00:59:55.633 line:82%
-I haven't had this milk in a while.
-Thank you for the food.

1179
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.934 line:82%
Enjoy the food.

1180
00:59:58.133 --> 01:00:00.934 line:82%
-I'm so happy.
-Why?

1181
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.567 line:82%
-I have food.
-Right.

1182
01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:04.934 line:82%
-I feel like a student.
-Enjoy the food.

1183
01:00:05.934 --> 01:00:08.033 line:82%
This is a taste I absolutely love.

1184
01:00:08.834 --> 01:00:09.900 line:82%
-It's tasty.
-It's tasty.

1185
01:00:11.967 --> 01:00:13.000 line:82%
It's tasty.

1186
01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:16.867 line:82%
Jung-ha.

1187
01:00:18.667 --> 01:00:19.500 line:82%
It's tasty.

1188
01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.967 line:82%
It's definitely a pyramid scheme.

1189
01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:34.734 line:82%
-How do you know?
-Look over there.

1190
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.233 line:82%
Pizza. Ramyeon.

1191
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.700 line:82%
Miyeokguk or seaweed soup. Dressed salad.

1192
01:00:38.767 --> 01:00:41.100 line:82%
PYRAMID

1193
01:00:41.767 --> 01:00:43.767 line:82%
The milk is shaped like a pyramid too.

1194
01:00:43.834 --> 01:00:45.900 line:82%
-It's a triangle.
-That's right.

1195
01:00:45.967 --> 01:00:47.166 line:82%
You're right.

1196
01:00:48.066 --> 01:00:50.500 line:82%
Jae-seok, they don't know
about the key word,

1197
01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:51.734 line:82%
-pyramid.
-They do.

1198
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.266 line:82%
-Do they?
-Jung-ha came to me and asked.

1199
01:00:54.333 --> 01:00:56.734 line:82%
-Can you share information?
-I figured it out.

1200
01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.233 line:82%
-I figured it out too.
-Really?

1201
01:00:59.867 --> 01:01:01.567 line:82%
Does it have three syllables?

1202
01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.266 line:82%
The next key word has one syllable.

1203
01:01:05.934 --> 01:01:07.233 line:82%
-Is it right?
-Yes.

1204
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.266 line:82%
-I think they only have a vague idea.
-Yes.

1205
01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:11.633 line:82%
A vague idea.

1206
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.500 line:82%
Hold on. I feel like
people are disappearing one by one.

1207
01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.500 line:82%
Why do people keep leaving
in the middle of eating?

1208
01:01:25.567 --> 01:01:28.200 line:82%
Aren't they leaving
since they finished eating?

1209
01:01:28.266 --> 01:01:30.233 line:82%
-Right?
-Yes. That has to be the case.

1210
01:01:31.133 --> 01:01:33.433 line:82%
Gosh, they don't let up
even during mealtime.

1211
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.300 line:82%
Jung-ha.

1212
01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.200 line:82%
Yes, Jae-seok?

1213
01:01:41.266 --> 01:01:44.033 line:82%
You shouldn't get up
before an elder finishes eating.

1214
01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.500 line:82%
-I'm sorry.
-Come here.

1215
01:01:49.467 --> 01:01:50.367 line:82%
Thank you.

1216
01:01:53.567 --> 01:01:55.967 line:82%
Why are you questioning everything
during mealtime?

1217
01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.533 line:82%
-Aren't you going to make deductions?
-What?

1218
01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.533 line:82%
Aren't you going to make deductions?
You aren't here to eat.

1219
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.867 line:82%
The culprit will get caught
by the time we finish filming.

1220
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.600 line:82%
Don't worry.

1221
01:02:08.166 --> 01:02:10.133 line:82%
The culprit will get caught
by the time we're done.

1222
01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.166 line:82%
You have a point.

1223
01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:14.967 line:82%
Today is finally the day
Jae-seok has a role.

1224
01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:21.400 line:82%
Why does he keep whispering?

1225
01:02:24.266 --> 01:02:26.500 line:82%
-They all left.
-Yes. They all disappeared.

1226
01:02:31.467 --> 01:02:33.166 line:82%
What does it mean?

1227
01:02:33.233 --> 01:02:36.500 line:82%
They left since they were done eating.
They couldn't stay here all day.

1228
01:02:36.567 --> 01:02:37.767 line:82%
You have a point.

1229
01:02:37.834 --> 01:02:39.266 line:82%
-Right?
-Yes.

1230
01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:40.233 line:82%
Thank you for the food.

1231
01:02:42.567 --> 01:02:44.300 line:82%
Do I put it in here?

1232
01:02:44.367 --> 01:02:46.066 line:82%
I think you can leave it there.

1233
01:02:46.133 --> 01:02:47.567 line:82%
Thank you for the food.

1234
01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:50.400 line:82%
What?

1235
01:02:52.233 --> 01:02:55.300 line:82%
There's no exit over here.
How did the students leave?

1236
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.367 line:82%
TRAY RETURN

1237
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.567 line:82%
Their food trays are here,
but they disappeared.

1238
01:03:18.633 --> 01:03:21.133 line:82%
I just find it so strange.

1239
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.734 line:82%
Why did they disappear?

1240
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.867 line:82%
What?

1241
01:03:26.767 --> 01:03:29.433 line:82%
-Where did they go?
-There's no door.

1242
01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.300 line:82%
-Jae-seok, there must be a secret.
-Seriously.

1243
01:03:32.367 --> 01:03:34.834 line:82%
Finding the door must be our mission.

1244
01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.667 line:82%
Today, we must receive
the second crucial clue.

1245
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.934 line:82%
We must win the second game.

1246
01:03:50.867 --> 01:03:54.500 line:82%
You'll now play a game
for the second crucial clue.

1247
01:03:54.567 --> 01:03:55.533 line:82%
That sounds good.

1248
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.166 line:82%
All right.

1249
01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:59.633 line:82%
We must win this clue.

1250
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.467 line:82%
It's the Dance Club versus the Band Club.

1251
01:04:02.533 --> 01:04:04.567 line:82%
Please decide on your team chant.

1252
01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:06.867 line:82%
The team chant should be short.

1253
01:04:06.934 --> 01:04:09.533 line:82%
Ours will be JENNIE.

1254
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.433 line:82%
JENNIE.

1255
01:04:11.033 --> 01:04:12.033 line:82%
-Yes. JENNIE.
-JENNIE.

1256
01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.166 line:82%
-JENNIE is perfect.

01:10:18.834 --> 01:10:21.333 line:82%
It's "Shirt"? "A Yellow Shirt"?

1412
01:10:22.066 --> 01:10:23.700 line:82%
The Dance Club won.

1413
01:10:26.233 --> 01:10:27.567 line:82%
Oh, no. We needed to win.

1414
01:10:27.633 --> 01:10:29.734 line:82%
-We fought well.
-We did well.

1415
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.133 line:82%
-This is for the losing team.
-We get one too.

1416
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.567 line:82%
The losing team gets something.

1417
01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.834 line:82%
-Na-ra is hilarious.
-For goodness' sake.

1418
01:10:39.233 --> 01:10:41.033 line:82%
Shall I drink a cup of cold water?

1419
01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.667 line:82%
Go ahead, Jung-ha.

1420
01:10:44.266 --> 01:10:45.333 line:82%
Bong-seok.

1421
01:10:46.934 --> 01:10:49.033 line:82%
Ta-da. How do you want it?

1422
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.633 line:82%
As for me, I like it rich.

1423
01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.100 line:82%
It's important to add
the right amount of water.

1424
01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:55.633 line:82%
-You'll be surprised.
-Why?

1425
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.400 line:82%
This was developed
by the Entrepreneurship Club.

1426
01:10:58.467 --> 01:10:59.934 line:82%
-It features a new technology.
-What is it?

1427
01:11:00.066 --> 01:11:01.233 line:82%
Hi.

1428
01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.900 line:82%
I want 180 ml of water.

1429
01:11:09.467 --> 01:11:12.166 line:82%
Pouring 180 ml of water.

1430
01:11:12.233 --> 01:11:15.000 line:82%
The machine measures it itself.

1431
01:11:15.633 --> 01:11:17.700 line:82%
As you can see,
the measurement is precise.

1432
01:11:17.767 --> 01:11:19.567 line:82%
-It must be great for cooking.
-Very nice.

1433
01:11:19.633 --> 01:11:22.467 line:82%
This would help kids develop math skills.

1434
01:11:22.533 --> 01:11:24.900 line:82%
What's 120 plus 180?

1435
01:11:24.967 --> 01:11:26.300 line:82%
-It's 300.
-It's 300.

1436
01:11:28.533 --> 01:11:29.567 line:82%
Cheers.

1437
01:11:34.266 --> 01:11:36.567 line:82%
Both teams can move freely now.

1438
01:11:36.633 --> 01:11:38.700 line:82%
Se-chan and Jung-ha,
you'll film something first.

1439
01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.300 line:82%
Let me know what you find.
I'll join you afterward.

1440
01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:44.400 line:82%
What is it?

1441
01:11:49.133 --> 01:11:51.767 line:82%
MEMORIES FROM 2011

1442
01:11:51.834 --> 01:11:53.233 line:82%
WINNING TEAM - LOSING TEAM

1443
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.600 line:82%
GO TO THE GYM - GO TO THE GYM

1444
01:11:58.667 --> 01:12:00.667 line:82%
-"Go to the gym."
-The gym.

1445
01:12:00.734 --> 01:12:01.700 line:82%
Let's go.

1446
01:12:03.934 --> 01:12:05.100 line:82%
Jae-seok, is it you?

1447
01:12:06.834 --> 01:12:07.934 line:82%
Jae-seok, is it you?

1448
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.100 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-It's you.

1449
01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:13.467 line:82%
Why don't you come clean
since it's just us two here?

1450
01:12:13.533 --> 01:12:16.166 line:82%
-I'll help you.
-It isn't me.

1451
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.900 line:82%
-Here it is. Number two.
-Where?

1452
01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:21.967 line:82%
-We were at number three, so…
-Straight ahead?

1453
01:12:23.233 --> 01:12:24.600 line:82%
Is this the gym? Yes, it is.

1454
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.367 line:82%
Where did Jae-seok and JENNIE go?

1455
01:12:29.934 --> 01:12:31.934 line:82%
Na-ra, let's follow them.

1456
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.500 line:82%
-Let's go this way.
-The gym.

1457
01:12:33.567 --> 01:12:34.567 line:82%
Yes.

1458
01:12:34.633 --> 01:12:36.734 line:82%
The gym looks very sleek.

1459
01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.967 line:82%
What? There's a camcorder.

1460
01:12:46.266 --> 01:12:48.967 line:82%
-I guess we can use it to watch the tape.
-That's right.

1461
01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.200 line:82%
The gym.

1462
01:12:57.367 --> 01:12:58.500 line:82%
What?

1463
01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.700 line:82%
What about Jung-ha?

1464
01:13:04.767 --> 01:13:05.600 line:82%
Who?

1465
01:13:05.667 --> 01:13:07.166 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-It's Se-chan.

1466
01:13:07.233 --> 01:13:09.400 line:82%
I promised to relay the information.

1467
01:13:10.433 --> 01:13:11.300 line:82%
It can't be helped.

1468
01:13:11.367 --> 01:13:13.567 line:82%
Besides, only two people can use
the earphones.

1469
01:13:13.633 --> 01:13:14.467 line:82%
That's right.

1470
01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:17.367 line:82%
Can we check this out without Jung-ha?

1471
01:13:17.934 --> 01:13:19.900 line:82%
He doesn't have a separate mission,
does he?

1472
01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.433 line:82%
-Let's go, Jung-ha.
-What was that?

1473
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.567 line:82%
Let's go.

1474
01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.333 line:82%
-It's playing.
-Yes.

1475
01:13:32.734 --> 01:13:35.367 line:82%
In Songpa-gu, Seoul…

1476
01:13:35.433 --> 01:13:37.400 line:82%
college students involved
in pyramid schemes

1477
01:13:37.967 --> 01:13:39.367 line:82%
are called…

1478
01:13:40.433 --> 01:13:41.867 line:82%
What are they called?

1479
01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.066 line:82%
The police caught pyramid scheme employees

1480
01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:47.600 line:82%
who lured college students
with a promise of employment

1481
01:13:47.667 --> 01:13:49.967 line:82%
only to force purchases and lock them up.

1482
01:13:50.033 --> 01:13:53.200 line:82%
They forced purchases and locked them up.

1483
01:13:55.066 --> 01:13:56.734 line:82%
Late one night,

1484
01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.667 line:82%
we visited a dormitory in Seoul
used by people running a pyramid scam.

1485
01:13:59.734 --> 01:14:02.400 line:82%
When we entered, a male student

1486
01:14:02.467 --> 01:14:04.700 line:82%
was washing his hair at the kitchen sink.

1487
01:14:04.767 --> 01:14:07.567 line:82%
Over ten male and female students

1488
01:14:07.633 --> 01:14:09.600 line:82%
were getting trained in a small room.

1489
01:14:09.667 --> 01:14:12.200 line:82%
They told us to follow their orders

1490
01:14:12.266 --> 01:14:14.500 line:82%
if we wanted to make money.

1491
01:14:14.567 --> 01:14:16.667 line:82%
After the training session ended,

1492
01:14:16.734 --> 01:14:19.400 line:82%
we ate ramyeon together in a cramped room.

1493
01:14:20.233 --> 01:14:22.900 line:82%
What are they forcing the students to do?

1494
01:14:24.066 --> 01:14:25.600 line:82%
They run a pyramid scheme.

1495
01:14:26.367 --> 01:14:29.734 line:82%
These are the items we have to sell.

1496
01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:34.000 line:82%
I had no way to run away.
I didn't have a phone.

1497
01:14:37.834 --> 01:14:40.467 line:82%
Even when I used the restroom,
two people followed me.

1498
01:14:42.367 --> 01:14:43.734 line:82%
They went that far?

1499
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.300 line:82%
That's right. I remember this incident.

1500
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.900 line:82%
Over 5,000 college students
who signed with the company

1501
01:14:49.967 --> 01:14:52.200 line:82%
were watched and controlled rigorously.

1502
01:14:52.266 --> 01:14:54.533 line:82%
They had to live
in a substandard dormitory

1503
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.500 line:82%
where they couldn't even watch TV
or read newspapers.

1504
01:14:57.567 --> 01:14:59.834 line:82%
The college students
who signed with the company

1505
01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:03.266 line:82%
even turned to robbery
due to extreme financial hardships.

1506
01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:07.033 line:82%
According to them,
many college students are still locked up

1507
01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:10.033 line:82%
at a secret location.

1508
01:15:11.266 --> 01:15:13.800 line:82%
In Songpa-gu, Seoul…

1509
01:15:13.867 --> 01:15:17.100 line:82%
a crime ring that forced
5,000 college students to live in a dorm

1510
01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:20.133 line:82%
and participate in
an illegal pyramid scheme got caught.

1511
01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:22.200 line:82%
-Where are they?
-That startled me.

1512
01:15:22.266 --> 01:15:23.100 line:82%
What?

1513
01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:24.233 line:82%
-Where are they?
-Where?

1514
01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.900 line:82%
-Where are they?
-There's no door.

1515
01:15:25.967 --> 01:15:27.300 line:82%
Where did they go?

1516
01:15:27.367 --> 01:15:28.500 line:82%
There's no door.

1517
01:15:28.567 --> 01:15:31.500 line:82%
There's no exit over here.
How did the students leave?

1518
01:15:31.567 --> 01:15:33.266 line:82%
There's no door.

1519
01:15:33.333 --> 01:15:35.100 line:82%
-Where did they go?
-What?

1520
01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.166 line:82%
What?

1521
01:15:44.367 --> 01:15:47.500 line:82%
"Find the students
and members who disappeared."

1522
01:15:47.567 --> 01:15:50.400 line:82%
Jung-ha and Se-chan disappeared.

1523
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.800 line:82%
What? Did they stay back on purpose?

1524
01:15:53.867 --> 01:15:55.834 line:82%
Were they acting?

1525
01:15:58.467 --> 01:16:00.533 line:82%
A crime ring that forced college students

1526
01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.967 line:82%
to live in a dormitory
and participate in a pyramid scheme…

1527
01:16:03.667 --> 01:16:07.066 line:82%
Saying that to sell a product
they must use them,

1528
01:16:07.133 --> 01:16:09.400 line:82%
they forced the students
to buy the products.

1529
01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:12.600 line:82%
Na-ra, the blueberry juice looks good.

1530
01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:14.867 line:82%
-Don't touch it.
-Can't I touch it?

1531
01:16:15.834 --> 01:16:17.533 line:82%
-Shall we wear a pair each?
-Shall we?

1532
01:16:20.767 --> 01:16:23.033 line:82%
Even when I used the restroom,
two people followed me.

1533
01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.233 line:82%
Today, I have this feeling.

1534
01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:40.066 line:82%
What? Did they stay back on purpose?

1535
01:16:40.133 --> 01:16:41.433 line:82%
Were they acting?

1536
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.900 line:82%
We need to find the members.

1537
01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.133 line:82%
-You're right.
-Yes.

1538
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.333 line:82%
My goodness.

1539
01:16:52.166 --> 01:16:53.300 line:82%
Are we on the same team?

1540
01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:56.066 line:82%
Are we on the same team?

1541
01:17:01.066 --> 01:17:02.300 line:82%
My goodness.

1542
01:17:03.667 --> 01:17:04.700 line:82%
What is it?

1543
01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.066 line:82%
Who is it?

1544
01:17:08.133 --> 01:17:09.266 line:82%
-Is there something?
-What?

1545
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.533 line:82%
The ones who got locked up…

1546
01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.367 line:82%
What is it? What?

1547
01:17:14.433 --> 01:17:16.166 line:82%
What?

1548
01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:18.967 line:82%
This is the place.

1549
01:17:21.734 --> 01:17:23.734 line:82%
That was why people kept disappearing.

1550
01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.867 line:82%
-My goodness.
-It's so chilling.

1551
01:17:26.367 --> 01:17:28.433 line:82%
-My goodness.
-It's so chilling.

1552
01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.000 line:82%
What's this?

1553
01:17:32.166 --> 01:17:35.266 line:82%
This company running the pyramid scheme
told the students

1554
01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:37.266 line:82%
that they could earn ten million won
a month

1555
01:17:37.333 --> 01:17:40.066 line:82%
and find a job at a big company.

1556
01:17:40.133 --> 01:17:42.633 line:82%
They lured college students
who were struggling

1557
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.767 line:82%
due to the low employment rate
and expensive tuition.

1558
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.266 line:82%
-My goodness.
-It's so chilling.

1559
01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:52.500 line:82%
What's this? I actually have goose bumps.

1560
01:17:52.567 --> 01:17:54.767 line:82%
-They're the missing students.
-I guess so.

1561
01:17:54.834 --> 01:17:56.800 line:82%
They're the missing students.

1562
01:18:08.467 --> 01:18:12.667 line:82%
We need to find these people
as well as the members.

1563
01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:16.533 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Were they a team? Jung-ha and Se-chan?

1564
01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.767 line:82%
Jung-ha and Se-chan?

1565
01:18:17.834 --> 01:18:20.233 line:82%
I'm sorry. I suspected you.

1566
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.834 line:82%
Na-ra. For goodness' sake.

1567
01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:24.033 line:82%
What? What's that?

1568
01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:35.133 line:82%
What? Why are their photos here?

1569
01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:46.200 line:82%
-I see. They got kidnapped.
-Right.

1570
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.500 line:82%
-Right.
-They got kidnapped.

1571
01:18:51.667 --> 01:18:54.300 line:82%
-They got kidnapped. We must find them.
-That's right.

1572
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.567 line:82%
There wasn't a hint
that made someone look suspicious.

1573
01:18:59.633 --> 01:19:00.734 line:82%
What was it?

1574
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.767 line:82%
Our hint? Pyramid.

1575
01:19:06.233 --> 01:19:08.166 line:82%
-That's right.
-Was that what you got?

1576
01:19:08.233 --> 01:19:10.533 line:82%
We found out that it was a pyramid scheme.

1577
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.867 line:82%
Gosh, you startled me. What are you doing?

1578
01:19:14.433 --> 01:19:16.600 line:82%
Gosh, you startled me. What are you doing?

1579
01:19:16.667 --> 01:19:18.900 line:82%
Gosh, you startled me.

1580
01:19:20.567 --> 01:19:21.734 line:82%
My goodness.

1581
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.133 line:82%
Why are you doing this?

1582
01:19:24.367 --> 01:19:26.600 line:82%
My goodness.

1583
01:19:26.667 --> 01:19:29.967 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-You startled me.

1584
01:19:30.033 --> 01:19:32.233 line:82%
Why are you taking me?

1585
01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.400 line:82%
-I don't like this.
-I was so startled.

1586
01:19:34.467 --> 01:19:35.600 line:82%
Stop it.

1587
01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:37.800 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-It isn't me.

1588
01:19:37.867 --> 01:19:39.100 line:82%
It isn't me. Why…

1589
01:19:43.233 --> 01:19:44.600 line:82%
-Are you serious?
-A blindfold.

1590
01:19:44.667 --> 01:19:46.967 line:82%
Are you serious? I can't see anything.

1591
01:19:52.033 --> 01:19:54.266 line:82%
Where are you taking me? Help!

1592
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.367 line:82%
This is an announcement.

1593
01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:06.700 line:82%
Se-chan and Jung-ha have been kidnapped…

1594
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.066 line:82%
…and are locked up somewhere on campus.

1595
01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:16.300 line:82%
The first team to find and rescue
their teammate

1596
01:20:16.367 --> 01:20:18.967 line:82%
by 4 p.m. today will be today's winners.

1597
01:20:23.233 --> 01:20:25.400 line:82%
-It isn't me.
-You startled me.

1598
01:20:25.467 --> 01:20:26.900 line:82%
It isn't me!

1599
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.800 line:82%
Let's go.

1600
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:31.667 line:82%
Let's go outside.

1601
01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.900 line:82%
-Hold on.
-I'm ready.

1602
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.200 line:82%
-Jae-seok, what does this mean?
-"The back right corner of the structure"?

1603
01:20:42.133 --> 01:20:44.967 line:82%
"The back right corner of the structure"?

1604
01:20:48.667 --> 01:20:49.800 line:82%
What?

1605
01:20:52.233 --> 01:20:53.867 line:82%
"The back right…"

1606
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.200 line:82%
What does this mean?

1607
01:20:58.333 --> 01:21:01.500 line:82%
-I don't think I'll remember it.
-Take a photo.

1608
01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:06.266 line:82%
-Jae-seok, what does this mean?
-"The back right corner of the structure"?

1609
01:21:08.166 --> 01:21:10.100 line:82%
THE WINNING TEAM'S HINT:
3-2-1-3-4-1

1610
01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:14.200 line:82%
THE BACK RIGHT CORNER
OF THE STRUCTURE

1611
01:21:22.367 --> 01:21:23.834 line:82%
We don't know anything.

1612
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.900 line:82%
I found them.

1613
01:21:28.967 --> 01:21:31.867 line:82%
That isn't it. That's an electric car.

1614
01:21:33.533 --> 01:21:35.934 line:82%
-Isn't this it?
-It's currently 2011.

1615
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.333 line:82%
Jung-ha.

1616
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.567 line:82%
Where did they go?

1617
01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:46.367 line:82%
-Jung-ha!
-Se-chan!

1618
01:21:55.533 --> 01:21:57.133 line:82%
Jae-seok.

1619
01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.200 line:82%
…promotional matrimony on the school.
Captains, take this.

1620
01:22:01.266 --> 01:22:02.867 line:82%
Make sure you don't loose it.

1621
01:22:10.367 --> 01:22:13.233 line:82%
"The back right corner of the structure"?

1622
01:22:14.667 --> 01:22:16.266 line:82%
"The back right corner"?

1623
01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:18.533 line:82%
I don't understand what it means.

1624
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.934 line:82%
What does it mean?

1625
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.667 line:82%
-Three, two, one…
-Three, four…

1626
01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:28.433 line:82%
Three, four, one.

1627
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.400 line:82%
So the buildings make this shape.

1628
01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.567 line:82%
So the buildings make this shape.

1629
01:22:36.934 --> 01:22:38.800 line:82%
What's this shape?

1630
01:22:41.867 --> 01:22:43.667 line:82%
It's a pyramid.

1631
01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.667 line:82%
"The back right corner"?

1632
01:22:48.533 --> 01:22:52.133 line:82%
It must be the right side
from our perspective. In that case…

1633
01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.934 line:82%
-Then the back right corner…
-The back right corner.

1634
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.467 line:82%
-Number four.
-Then it's number four.

1635
01:22:58.467 --> 01:23:01.800 line:82%
"The back right corner of the structure."

1636
01:23:01.867 --> 01:23:03.066 line:82%
This is the spot.

1637
01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:11.867 line:82%
We'll save you guys.

1638
01:23:18.166 --> 01:23:19.600 line:82%
Please.

1639
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:21.834 line:82%
-Come here.
-Please.

1640
01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:23.100 line:82%
My goodness.

1641
01:23:24.266 --> 01:23:27.400 line:82%
-Come here, JENNIE.
-No catching.

1642
01:23:27.467 --> 01:23:29.333 line:82%
Let's go back to the apartment.

1643
01:23:32.533 --> 01:23:34.066 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Come here.

1644
01:23:34.834 --> 01:23:36.967 line:82%
How are we supposed to find them?

1645
01:23:37.033 --> 01:23:38.300 line:82%
How?

1646
01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:41.600 line:82%
We didn't get any hints.

1647
01:23:41.667 --> 01:23:44.567 line:82%
Na-ra, why don't we make it simple
by calling them?

1648
01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:48.667 line:82%
-
Hello?
-Hey.

1649
01:23:48.734 --> 01:23:50.066 line:82%
-Where are you?
-Where are you?

1650
01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:56.934 line:82%
Tae-hyun, I got kidnapped
and put in a shipping container.

1651
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.934 line:82%
Many other people are locked up here.

1652
01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.467 line:82%
What are you guys doing?

1653
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.734 line:82%
My future.

1654
01:24:21.333 --> 01:24:24.734 line:82%
…a crime ring that forced
5,000 college students to live in a dorm

1655
01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.867 line:82%
and participate in
an illegal pyramid scheme got caught.

1656
01:24:27.934 --> 01:24:31.767 line:82%
A room measuring ten pyeong
was shared by ten victims.

1657
01:24:31.834 --> 01:24:35.200 line:82%
They were even watched
by the perpetrators.

1658
01:24:38.633 --> 01:24:41.734 line:82%
Saying that to sell a product
they must use them,

1659
01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.300 line:82%
they forced the students
to buy the products.

1660
01:24:44.367 --> 01:24:47.300 line:82%
Students who had no money
were even forced to take out loans.

1661
01:24:49.066 --> 01:24:51.333 line:82%
Please save me!

1662
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.166 line:82%
Anyone!

1663
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.800 line:82%
Which way?

1664
01:24:55.867 --> 01:24:58.734 line:82%
I couldn't see anything
since I was blindfolded.

1665
01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.100 line:82%
Which way did you go?

1666
01:25:00.166 --> 01:25:01.967 line:82%
Where is Se-chan? Se-chan.

1667
01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:07.233 line:82%
-Which way? To the right?
-
Tae-hyun, save me.

1668
01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.467 line:82%
On my way here,

1669
01:25:10.533 --> 01:25:14.300 line:82%
I heard someone say,
"Your kindness can help other people."

1670
01:25:15.567 --> 01:25:17.800 line:82%
I don't like this. Please let me go.

1671
01:25:17.867 --> 01:25:20.000 line:82%
Where are you taking me? Please save me.

1672
01:25:23.166 --> 01:25:25.233 line:82%
Your kindness can help other people.

1673
01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.033 line:82%
"Your kindness can help other people."

1674
01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:32.367 line:82%
After that,
I think I heard a violin playing.

1675
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.800 line:82%
I hear a violin.

1676
01:25:36.333 --> 01:25:38.633 line:82%
I also heard the sound of samulnori.

1677
01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.867 line:82%
-Samulnori?
-Samulnori?

1678
01:25:40.567 --> 01:25:41.900 line:82%
What's that sound? Drums?

1679
01:25:47.033 --> 01:25:49.667 line:82%
-
I'm so scared. Please save me.
-Okay.

1680
01:25:51.066 --> 01:25:52.700 line:82%
Hang in there. I'll find you.

1681
01:25:52.767 --> 01:25:54.633 line:82%
-What? Hold on.
-There it is.

1682
01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.166 line:82%
He heard that sound.

1683
01:25:57.734 --> 01:26:00.333 line:82%
Show kindness to your neighbors.

1684
01:26:08.567 --> 01:26:09.734 line:82%
Jung-ha!

1685
01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.266 line:82%
He went that way.

1686
01:26:11.934 --> 01:26:14.467 line:82%
This is sudden.

1687
01:26:16.533 --> 01:26:18.867 line:82%
It's the violin. It's this way.

1688
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:24.300 line:82%
-That's sudden. Bravo. She's good.
-I mean…

1689
01:26:24.367 --> 01:26:25.934 line:82%
I'm too full to run.

1690
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.633 line:82%
Samulnori.

1691
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.367 line:82%
Where is he?

1692
01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.734 line:82%
Na-ra.

1693
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.500 line:82%
-Is he nearby?
-He heard this sound.

1694
01:26:57.533 --> 01:26:58.967 line:82%
Hey, Se-chan.

1695
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.500 line:82%
-Number four.
-Back right corner. Number four.

1696
01:27:05.567 --> 01:27:06.867 line:82%
It's here.

1697
01:27:07.433 --> 01:27:09.133 line:82%
-Here.
-There?

1698
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.333 line:82%
-There.
-There.

1699
01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.066 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-Se-chan.

1700
01:27:13.633 --> 01:27:14.700 line:82%
Se-chan.

1701
01:27:15.233 --> 01:27:16.734 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-There.

1702
01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.133 line:82%
Jae-seok.

1703
01:27:19.633 --> 01:27:20.867 line:82%
Se-chan.

1704
01:27:21.633 --> 01:27:24.000 line:82%
-Hurry up and open the door.
-Hey.

1705
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.133 line:82%
-Se-chan.
-There's a lock.

1706
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.166 line:82%
-Where?
-Here.

1707
01:27:28.233 --> 01:27:29.834 line:82%
-There's a lock.
-Where?

1708
01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:30.734 line:82%
Here.

1709
01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:34.333 line:82%
Don't you know the passcode?

1710
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.300 line:82%
Se-chan.

1711
01:27:36.367 --> 01:27:37.900 line:82%
How do I open it?

1712
01:27:37.967 --> 01:27:39.400 line:82%
Is the place big or small?

1713
01:27:39.467 --> 01:27:40.700 line:82%
Is it big?

1714
01:27:40.767 --> 01:27:43.900 line:82%
It's narrow.
It's a single shipping container.

1715
01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:47.700 line:82%
It's this one. The shipping container.

1716
01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:50.400 line:82%
Hey.

1717
01:27:50.467 --> 01:27:51.867 line:82%
Jung-ha.

1718
01:27:52.633 --> 01:27:54.900 line:82%
Jung-ha.

1719
01:27:54.967 --> 01:27:56.433 line:82%
You're in here, right?

1720
01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.467 line:82%
-Jung-ha, are you inside?
-What?

1721
01:27:58.533 --> 01:28:00.266 line:82%
-My goodness.
-Is it open?

1722
01:28:01.867 --> 01:28:04.300 line:82%
-Gosh, this isn't it.
-Come on.

1723
01:28:04.367 --> 01:28:05.500 line:82%
This isn't it.

1724
01:28:05.567 --> 01:28:08.000 line:82%
There must be a shipping container
like this one.

1725
01:28:08.066 --> 01:28:09.667 line:82%
A shipping container.

1726
01:28:09.734 --> 01:28:10.900 line:82%
Over there.

1727
01:28:10.967 --> 01:28:11.967 line:82%
Na-ra, I'm here.

1728
01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.467 line:82%
-There it is.
-Okay.

1729
01:28:15.533 --> 01:28:18.867 line:82%
-I'm locked in.
-Jung-ha, I'm coming.

1730
01:28:18.934 --> 01:28:21.133 line:82%
Tae-hyun, save me.

1731
01:28:22.367 --> 01:28:24.000 line:82%
Jung-ha, I'll save you.

1732
01:28:24.667 --> 01:28:26.867 line:82%
My junior, Jung-ha.

1733
01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.333 line:82%
Hurry up and open the door.

1734
01:28:31.166 --> 01:28:32.333 line:82%
Hold on. How do I open this?

1735
01:28:33.367 --> 01:28:36.133 line:82%
-He's here. Jung-ha.
-Jung-ha.

1736
01:28:36.633 --> 01:28:40.266 line:82%
-Tae-hyun, there's a passcode.
-He's here.

1737
01:28:40.333 --> 01:28:42.400 line:82%
What? I don't know the passcode.

1738
01:28:45.033 --> 01:28:46.767 line:82%
The team that rescues
their teammate first wins.

1739
01:28:50.467 --> 01:28:52.934 line:82%
-There's nothing inside?
-There's nothing.

1740
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.300 line:82%
There are socks.

1741
01:28:55.367 --> 01:28:57.467 line:82%
-You're really locked in.
-Yes.

1742
01:28:58.367 --> 01:28:59.600 line:82%
Blueberry juice.

1743
01:29:02.934 --> 01:29:05.834 line:82%
Jung-ha, are there any clues
to the passcode inside?

1744
01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:09.700 line:82%
Tae-hyun, I think I found a clue
to the passcode.

1745
01:29:09.767 --> 01:29:12.600 line:82%
"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon."

1746
01:29:13.333 --> 01:29:19.600 line:82%
IT STARTS IN OSAN
AND ENDS IN INCHEON

1747
01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:22.800 line:82%
"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon."

1748
01:29:22.867 --> 01:29:26.433 line:82%
-"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon"?
-Yes. "It starts in Osan."

1749
01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.000 line:82%
What does that mean?

1750
01:29:29.066 --> 01:29:31.500 line:82%
"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon."

1751
01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:35.000 line:82%
Osan. What's the area code?

1752
01:29:35.066 --> 01:29:38.200 line:82%
-Gyeonggi Province's area code is 031.
-Osan, so…

1753
01:29:38.266 --> 01:29:40.934 line:82%
You don't know the area code for Osan.

1754
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.233 line:82%
I don't know it.

1755
01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.233 line:82%
Hey, try 031032.

1756
01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:58.300 line:82%
It ends in Incheon. It starts in Osan.

1757
01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.700 line:82%
IT STARTS IN OSAN AND ENDS IN INCHEON

1758
01:30:03.767 --> 01:30:06.633 line:82%
-Tae-hyun, try 5427.
-Osan.

1759
01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.934 line:82%
Incheon. Five, four. Incheon.

1760
01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.400 line:82%
I'll try 5427.

1761
01:30:13.767 --> 01:30:15.900 line:82%
-It isn't 5427.
-This is driving me crazy.

1762
01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:24.133 line:82%
Is there anything else? Look for a clue.

1763
01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:27.000 line:82%
Hurry up. Hurry up and look for a clue.

1764
01:30:29.867 --> 01:30:31.233 line:82%
There's nothing.

1765
01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.433 line:82%
-There's nothing.
-Everyone is here.

1766
01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.667 line:82%
They're here.

1767
01:30:36.734 --> 01:30:38.000 line:82%
Look carefully.

1768
01:30:41.467 --> 01:30:43.600 line:82%
What's that? Hold on. What's this?

1769
01:30:44.166 --> 01:30:45.867 line:82%
-Hold on.
-Is there a clue?

1770
01:30:45.934 --> 01:30:47.900 line:82%
-What's this?
-There's a clue.

1771
01:30:49.066 --> 01:30:51.266 line:82%
Let's see it. Show me the clue you found.

1772
01:30:57.667 --> 01:30:59.467 line:82%
-What's that?
-A question mark?

1773
01:30:59.533 --> 01:31:02.266 line:82%
-"Sad Cohabitation of 'Blank' Students."
-What?

1774
01:31:07.367 --> 01:31:08.500 line:82%
What?

1775
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:11.567 line:82%
Hold on. "Reportage."

1776
01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:15.200 line:82%
"Sad Cohabitation of 'Blank' Students."

1777
01:31:15.767 --> 01:31:16.600 line:82%
What?

1778
01:31:17.734 --> 01:31:19.200 line:82%
What's the number?

1779
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.233 line:82%
Five thousand.

1780
01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.200 line:82%
In Songpa-gu, Seoul…

1781
01:31:34.266 --> 01:31:37.633 line:82%
a crime ring that forced
5,000 college students to live in a dorm

1782
01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:40.900 line:82%
and participate in
an illegal pyramid scheme got caught.

1783
01:31:40.967 --> 01:31:43.500 line:82%
"It starts in Osan and ends in Incheon."

1784
01:31:46.467 --> 01:31:49.133 line:82%
-It's five thousand.
-Five thousand?

1785
01:32:01.166 --> 01:32:05.533 line:82%
-It opened! Jung-ha!
-It opened!

1786
01:32:06.934 --> 01:32:08.800 line:82%
I don't know.
We opened it at the same time.

1787
01:32:08.867 --> 01:32:10.100 line:82%
Come on out.

1788
01:32:10.166 --> 01:32:11.100 line:82%
Okay.

1789
01:32:11.166 --> 01:32:13.133 line:82%
The team that escaped first is…

1790
01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.467 line:82%
The Band Club.

1791
01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:21.667 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-How did it happen?

1792
01:32:21.734 --> 01:32:24.367 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-How did it happen?

1793
01:32:24.433 --> 01:32:26.233 line:82%
We got you out first.

1794
01:32:30.734 --> 01:32:33.867 line:82%
-It's open! Jung-ha!
-Hey!

1795
01:32:33.934 --> 01:32:34.934 line:82%
It's Jung-ha.

1796
01:32:37.033 --> 01:32:39.400 line:82%
-Jung-ha!
-Hey!

1797
01:32:40.967 --> 01:32:42.800 line:82%
Seniors.

1798
01:32:42.867 --> 01:32:45.600 line:82%
-What's that?
-What? Are you serious?

1799
01:32:45.667 --> 01:32:48.233 line:82%
The winning team will get a special prize.

1800
01:32:49.667 --> 01:32:51.066 line:82%
I'll eat it for a lifetime.

1801
01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:53.133 line:82%
I'm jealous.

1802
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.867 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1803
01:32:54.934 --> 01:32:56.233 line:82%
Did we escape first?

1804
01:32:57.567 --> 01:32:59.633 line:82%
-Really? Did we escape first?
-That's right.

1805
01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:03.800 line:82%
I remember this incident.

1806
01:33:03.867 --> 01:33:07.800 line:82%
In 2010 and 2011,
over 5,000 college students got locked up

1807
01:33:07.867 --> 01:33:09.367 line:82%
-due to a pyramid scheme.
-Yes.

1808
01:33:09.433 --> 01:33:12.000 line:82%
-They got locked up?
-So the passcode was 5000.

1809
01:33:12.066 --> 01:33:15.233 line:82%
Although years have passed,

1810
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.734 line:82%
-it's still a heartbreaking incident.
-I agree.

1811
01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.800 line:82%
It was a big incident
that shocked society.

1812
01:33:22.934 --> 01:33:25.233 line:82%
For the pyramid scheme
that amounted to one trillion won,

1813
01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:29.033 line:82%
the CEO and executives of Husstem Korea
were brought to trial.

1814
01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:32.333 line:82%
The prosecution estimates
there to be over 100,000 victims.

1815
01:33:32.934 --> 01:33:36.667 line:82%
In the past five years,
the most common form of fraud involved

1816
01:33:36.734 --> 01:33:39.467 line:82%
pyramid schemes that encouraged
investments in cryptocurrency.

1817
01:33:51.834 --> 01:33:54.000 line:82%
-We're late.
-We're late.

1818
01:33:54.066 --> 01:33:56.400 line:82%
-Get down.
-Come on, Mr. Im.

1819
01:33:56.467 --> 01:33:57.767 line:82%
Gosh.

1820
01:33:57.834 --> 01:33:59.333 line:82%
We're high schoolers.

1821
01:34:01.934 --> 01:34:03.333 line:82%
Stop acting out.

1822
01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.934 line:82%
-That's YEONJUN.
-YEONJUN is fighting.

1823
01:34:08.233 --> 01:34:09.400 line:82%
Is this a school?

1824
01:34:09.467 --> 01:34:11.000 line:82%
How is this possible in a school?

1825
01:34:11.066 --> 01:34:12.700 line:82%
Are they students?

1826
01:34:12.767 --> 01:34:15.000 line:82%
-It's a bit scary.
-Is it a laboratory?

1827
01:34:15.066 --> 01:34:16.900 line:82%
-Hey, lock the door.
-Why?

1828
01:34:16.967 --> 01:34:19.333 line:82%
-What are you doing? No.
-What's going on?

1829
01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.600 line:82%
Bring the teacher.

1830
01:34:20.667 --> 01:34:22.033 line:82%
-What?
-What's going on?

1831
01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:23.900 line:82%
Things are quite loud at the school.

1832
01:34:23.967 --> 01:34:25.133 line:82%
Please find it, Jae-seok.

1833
01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:29.033 line:82%
Why are so many things happening?
