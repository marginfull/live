Either way, the inevitable will happen.

2
00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:05.149 line:80%
After my dad died,

3
00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.735 line:80%
it feels like I'm on a boat every day.

4
00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:11.947 line:80%
I want to be happy.

5
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.590 line:80%
I want stability.

6
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.343 line:80%
I want to step on solid land.

7
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.400 line:80%
I'm not the right person for you.

8
00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.030 line:80%
Because I want you to be happy.

9
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.786 line:80%
You'll regret this.

10
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.998 line:80%
I won't regret it.

BASED ON THE NAVER SERIES WEBNOVEL
MARRY MY HUSBAND
BY SUNGSOJAK

13
00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:15.029 line:80%
Hello.

14
00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:16.906 line:80%
My goodness. Yang Ju-ran.

15
00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.699 line:80%
Are you just getting to work?

16
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.034 line:80%
That's just sucky.

17
00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:22.620 line:80%
Ju-ran, you can't be like this.

18
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.705 line:80%
You're management now.

19
00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.206 line:80%
You must get here early.

20
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.543 line:80%
Your computer should be on
before anyone else.

21
00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.671 line:80%
Also, I didn't want to say this,

22
00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:36.634 line:80%
but I saw your Jomart email.
"If you need anything, let me know"?

23
00:03:37.593 --> 00:03:40.971 line:80%
I mean, will you do everything people ask?
Is that it?

24
00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:45.059 line:80%
God, this is the problem with women.

25
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:49.855 line:80%
If you act that way,
it makes our entire team look bad.

26
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.692 line:80%
This is unbelievable.

27
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:58.072 line:80%
Mr. Kim isn't even the manager anymore.

28
00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:02.660 line:80%
When he was the manager, I never saw him
come early and turn on his computer.

29
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.413 line:80%
I think you need to address
his attitude once.

30
00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.041 line:80%
It's been officially announced.

31
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.211 line:80%
But in his position...

32
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.464 line:80%
What position?
He's not the manager anymore.

33
00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.801 line:80%
I think you should make it clear
that you're his boss.

34
00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:23.889 line:80%
You may be okay, but it'll be hard
for new recruits to adapt to our team.

35
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.852 line:80%
Excuse me.

36
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:33.649 line:80%
I hate Kim Gyeong-uk so much.

37
00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.401 line:80%
-Yeah.
-He's the worst.

38
00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.736 line:80%
How could he act like that?

39
00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.406 line:80%
Does he have no shame?

40
00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:42.491 line:80%
No sane person could act that way.

41
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.285 line:80%
Don't be ridiculous.

42
00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:47.663 line:80%
I've been promoted to manager.

43
00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.707 line:80%
How can I leave at 5?

44
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.125 line:80%
Work ends at 6...

45
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:53.502 line:80%
You may not know this,

46
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.462 line:80%
but I had a temper as a kid.

47
00:04:55.546 --> 00:05:00.551 line:80%
And my grandfather always stressed
the importance of patience.

48
00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.177 line:80%
I've lived by that...

49
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.847 line:80%
When did I look down on you?

50
00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:06.724 line:80%
Do I look like a bum?

51
00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:10.894 line:80%
Is this good?

52
00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:13.564 line:80%
Yeah, it tastes like coffee.

53
00:05:14.732 --> 00:05:17.276 line:80%
-Yeah.
-Give me one too.

54
00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.569 line:80%
I need to wake up.

55
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:22.573 line:80%
I think I have to leave early
and come back later.

56
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.419 line:80%
Can't your parents help?

57
00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.629 line:80%
It must be tough for you.

58
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:43.010 line:80%
My husband's at home.
How can I ask my parents for help?

59
00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.971 line:80%
But you practically do everything.

60
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.725 line:80%
-Worrying about your...
-My husband is...

61
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.273 line:80%
I feel so exposed.

62
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.692 line:80%
You're just like me.

63
00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:01.737 line:80%
I also worried about my husband...

64
00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:06.450 line:80%
No, I mean, my boyfriend.

65
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.163 line:80%
In the end, I was the one who was ruined.

66
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.167 line:80%
Hey.

67
00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:20.297 line:80%
I learned a lot.
Consideration has limits too.

68
00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:25.094 line:80%
Bad people won't appreciate
your consideration for them.

69
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.729 line:80%
Is Mr. Yu not coming to work today?

70
00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:38.148 line:80%
No. Do you have something to report?

71
00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:41.026 line:80%
He took a day off today. He's sick.

72
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.986 line:80%
I think he's caught a cold.

73
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:46.782 line:80%
It's been cold lately.
This is a first for him.

74
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.559 line:80%
Open up.

75
00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.356 line:80%
Hey, I said I didn't need it.

76
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.568 line:80%
You're so stubborn.
Did you have to make that?

77
00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:25.529 line:80%
You didn't do that for me.

78
00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:29.741 line:80%
It's for your own satisfaction.
I told you, I hate porridge.

79
00:07:32.703 --> 00:07:34.413 line:80%
Still, take one more bite.

80
00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.249 line:80%
I said, I won't. God damn it.

81
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.838 line:80%
This is so like me.

82
00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:03.775 line:80%
Is he not home?

83
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.287 line:80%
It's 20130419.

84
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.164 line:80%
My passcode.

85
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:25.964 line:80%
Pang?

86
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.134 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

87
00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:33.055 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

88
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:34.890 line:80%
Mr. Yu!

89
00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:41.730 line:80%
Get up. Let's go to the hospital.

90
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.074 line:80%
It's Kang Ji-won.

91
00:08:58.247 --> 00:09:00.666 line:80%
I can't keep seeing you like this.

92
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.963 line:80%
Are you okay?

93
00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.840 line:80%
A doctor came by.

94
00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:11.468 line:80%
I took my medicine.

95
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:24.231 line:80%
Are you still...

96
00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:26.984 line:80%
anxious?

97
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.321 line:80%
Does it feel rocky?

98
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.577 line:80%
I hope you don't feel like
you're on a boat.

99
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:48.255 line:80%
...it feels like I'm on a boat every day.

100
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:57.222 line:80%
My feet are firmly planted,
but the boat keeps rocking.

101
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.058 line:80%
I feel anxious.

102
00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.771 line:80%
I can't be your land.

103
00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.899 line:80%
I want stability.

104
00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:13.989 line:80%
I want to step on solid land.

105
00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:17.743 line:80%
I want to be solid land.

106
00:10:19.578 --> 00:10:23.415 line:80%
I hope you're stable and happy.

107
00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.169 line:80%
Because you're a good person.

108
00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:47.647 line:80%
Were you that man?

109
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.496 line:80%
I'm so hurt.

110
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.293 line:80%
I knew it was you
the moment I saw you again.

111
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:17.552 line:80%
You've always been in my heart.

112
00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.494 line:80%
Hello!

113
00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.751 line:80%
You're so much like your brother.

114
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.463 line:80%
What? I am?

115
00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.506 line:80%
That's such an insult.

116
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.883 line:80%
You're mean.

117
00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:39.718 line:80%
I came here to talk strategy.

118
00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:44.598 line:80%
I just happen to have two musical tickets.
You two should go together...

119
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.187 line:80%
Well, I...

120
00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:53.190 line:80%
Ji-won...

121
00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:55.525 line:80%
What?

122
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.531 line:80%
I thought I was okay.

123
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:08.163 line:80%
I'm not the wrong sentence...

124
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.542 line:80%
in her novel.

125
00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:17.881 line:80%
What? The wrong sentence?
What does that mean?

126
00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.369 line:80%
Hey. Are you okay?

127
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.498 line:80%
Your fever's down. That's good.

128
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.710 line:80%
I have to go to work!

129
00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.758 line:80%
Did something happen last night?

130
00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:50.098 line:80%
Wait.

131
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:55.145 line:80%
You won't say last night was a mistake,
will you?

132
00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:01.401 line:80%
No, that never happened.
I took medicine, so I was out of it.

133
00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.237 line:80%
And I thought seeing you was a dream.

134
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.199 line:80%
You remember then.

135
00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.289 line:80%
What did I say last night?

136
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.584 line:80%
You have a surprising side.

137
00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.420 line:80%
You spoke casually to me.

138
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.797 line:80%
I'm sorry.

139
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.634 line:80%
You said you hoped I was stable and happy.

140
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.764 line:80%
And that you recognized me
the moment we met again.

141
00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.143 line:80%
Also...

142
00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.855 line:80%
that you continued to like me.

143
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.028 line:80%
And that you wanted to be land for me.

144
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.573 line:80%
Ji-won, I...

145
00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.953 line:80%
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

146
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.424 line:80%
We might regret it.

147
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.764 line:80%
But let's regret it together if we do.

148
00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.558 line:80%
Then we'll be okay.

149
00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:25.985 line:80%
To tell the truth,
when you told me how you felt,

150
00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.572 line:80%
I thought it was the reason I came back.

151
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.828 line:80%
To be able to trust someone again,

152
00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:36.413 line:80%
like someone,

153
00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.417 line:80%
and be happy.

154
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.798 line:80%
I can do that, right?

155
00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:00.872 line:80%
What are you doing next weekend?

156
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.464 line:80%
Us? Whatever you want to do.

157
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.055 line:80%
"Us"?

158
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.501 line:80%
Let's talk.

159
00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:47.669 line:80%
Do it here.

160
00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.215 line:80%
We have to work together.

161
00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:56.094 line:80%
But treating me like I'm invisible
makes everyone uncomfortable.

162
00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.388 line:80%
You mean you are.

163
00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:02.517 line:80%
Then you shouldn't have
done something to cause that.

164
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.782 line:80%
Damn it!

165
00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.744 line:80%
Let go! Let go of me!

166
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.751 line:80%
I asked to break up

167
00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:32.714 line:80%
because our relationship isn't the same
as it used to be.

168
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.633 line:80%
I want a relationship
that everyone's envious of.

169
00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.262 line:80%
Damn it.

170
00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:41.014 line:80%
Where did things go wrong?

171
00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:53.776 line:80%
Are the only women you know on your team?

172
00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:57.530 line:80%
You messed up with that terrible woman,

173
00:19:57.614 --> 00:20:00.366 line:80%
and this one doesn't seem that better.

174
00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:03.494 line:80%
I'll be honest.

175
00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:09.417 line:80%
I didn't think my son would get married
this way.

176
00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:14.881 line:80%
Still, since you graduated
from Hankuk University.

177
00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:19.135 line:80%
She was a business major.
She's smart and good at her job.

178
00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:22.221 line:80%
And she'll work after she gives birth.
Great, right?

179
00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:24.933 line:80%
I liked studying, Mother.

180
00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.729 line:80%
Sons take after their moms.

181
00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:31.397 line:80%
Don't be too upset.

182
00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.985 line:80%
My mom didn't think I'd get married
like this either.

183
00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:39.322 line:80%
But I convinced her.

184
00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:43.034 line:80%
Also, she adores Min-hwan.

185
00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:44.285 line:80%
Yeah, that's true.

186
00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:47.121 line:80%
So your dad ran a business in Busan?

187
00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:49.040 line:80%
And your mom's a teacher?

188
00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:50.959 line:80%
Yes.

189
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.046 line:80%
Before my dad passed away,

190
00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:57.799 line:80%
our family was very happy.

191
00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:01.302 line:80%
I just want to live like my parents did.

192
00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.805 line:80%
They loved each other so much

193
00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.432 line:80%
and were very devoted parents.

194
00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:13.606 line:80%
From what I saw in the cooking class,
I can tell you're smart.

195
00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:18.152 line:80%
I lack a lot. I hope you can teach me.

196
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.824 line:80%
Originally, a woman needs to meet
the right man.

197
00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:26.661 line:80%
Judging by your taste in men,
you're very smart.

198
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.665 line:80%
-Eat up.
-Okay.

199
00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:34.252 line:80%
You're right. Sons take after their moms.

200
00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:36.963 line:80%
That's why Min-hwan takes after me

201
00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:38.673 line:80%
and is very smart.

202
00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.719 line:80%
You're right, Mother.

203
00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:49.308 line:80%
-Bye, Mom.
-Okay, I'm off.

204
00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.019 line:80%
Get home safe, Mother.

205
00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:52.145 line:80%
Okay, you too.

206
00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:00.069 line:80%
What?

207
00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:02.196 line:80%
Hankuk University?

208
00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:04.991 line:80%
Why did you lie about that?

209
00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:09.370 line:80%
I did it for you.

210
00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:11.122 line:80%
Ji-won graduated from there.

211
00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:15.084 line:80%
So how could I tell her
that you went to a no name college?

212
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:17.920 line:80%
You wanted a fresh start. Why lie--

213
00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:19.088 line:80%
Lie?

214
00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:22.383 line:80%
Does your mom adore me?

215
00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:25.428 line:80%
How can she when I've never met her?

216
00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:27.930 line:80%
Goodness...

217
00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.602 line:80%
Let's not get sensitive over this.

218
00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.979 line:80%
Everything will work out.

219
00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:39.275 line:80%
I think my mom approves.

220
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:42.570 line:80%
I'll tell you the date
of the family meeting.

221
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:45.656 line:80%
-See you then. Bye.
-What?

222
00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:58.795 line:80%
They booked a wedding hall?

223
00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:01.380 line:80%
It looks like they won't tell the company,

224
00:23:01.464 --> 00:23:04.133 line:80%
-but it's called Crown...
-Crown Wedding Hall.

225
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:05.885 line:80%
That's it.

226
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:08.763 line:80%
That's where I married him.

227
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:15.019 line:80%
It's the worst place imaginable to women.

228
00:23:18.773 --> 00:23:19.982 line:80%
It must be over now.

229
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.906 line:80%
This is huge news.

230
00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:30.952 line:80%
My parents told my husband
to work at their restaurant.

231
00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:36.499 line:80%
We didn't say anything
when you quit your job

232
00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:41.254 line:80%
because we thought it didn't matter
which one worked outside these days.

233
00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:42.171 line:80%
But!

234
00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:44.757 line:80%
My daughter goes to work,

235
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.718 line:80%
takes care of Yeon-ji,
and does the housework.

236
00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:50.388 line:80%
Ju-ran does everything.

237
00:23:55.852 --> 00:23:57.228 line:80%
I should go to work.

238
00:23:57.311 --> 00:24:01.816 line:80%
The head of the family raising a child
and doing housework is just...

239
00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:05.361 line:80%
That's why I'm telling you
to work at our
galbi
restaurant.

240
00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:09.323 line:80%
It's big, so there's so much to do.
Wash the grills and dishes,

241
00:24:09.407 --> 00:24:12.243 line:80%
get the meat, serve customers, clean.

242
00:24:12.326 --> 00:24:15.079 line:80%
Sir, just hear me out.

243
00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:18.791 line:80%
I'm not the type to do that kind of work.

244
00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:20.001 line:80%
What...

245
00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.587 line:80%
How could you say that?

246
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.505 line:80%
You're not the type?

247
00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:28.342 line:80%
-Then what type of work is for you?
-Housework and parenting?

248
00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:32.638 line:80%
It's decided then.

249
00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:37.059 line:80%
Wake up early, take Ju-ran to work,
and bring Yeon-ji to the restaurant.

250
00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:41.731 line:80%
You're amazing.

251
00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:46.819 line:80%
Ms. Yang usually just puts up with things.
And you helped her take a step further.

252
00:24:57.371 --> 00:25:00.374 line:80%
Isn't this great? So refreshing, right?

253
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.923 line:80%
I'd always come here
when I had a hard time in college.

254
00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:11.093 line:80%
To regain the strength to keep going.

255
00:25:13.638 --> 00:25:16.015 line:80%
It's my first time coming here happy.

256
00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:26.317 line:80%
Wow... I never though I'd have this again.

257
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.652 line:80%
Is it a hot spot?

258
00:25:28.653 --> 00:25:29.946 line:80%
To me, it is.

259
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:33.032 line:80%
It disappears in a few years
because of redevelopment.

260
00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:38.037 line:80%
Do you remember?

261
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.997 line:80%
We went to eat
gukbap
.

262
00:25:41.415 --> 00:25:42.875 line:80%
Wasn't I brave then?

263
00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:47.880 line:80%
I was so surprised.

264
00:25:47.964 --> 00:25:50.925 line:80%
To see such a luxurious
gukbap
restaurant.

265
00:25:53.803 --> 00:25:57.014 line:80%
You were quite classy.
You gave off a young and rich vibe.

266
00:25:57.765 --> 00:25:58.891 line:80%
No way.

267
00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:06.774 line:80%
There. The way you put the rice
into the soup.

268
00:26:06.857 --> 00:26:08.651 line:80%
Anyone could tell.

269
00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:12.863 line:80%
Add the
jeongguji
.

270
00:26:12.947 --> 00:26:15.324 line:80%
That's right. I should.

271
00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:19.245 line:80%
No.

272
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.748 line:80%
I was kidding.

273
00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:39.724 line:80%
This one. Chives.

274
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:43.894 line:80%
This isn't a side dish.
You put it in your soup.

275
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.983 line:80%
But people from Seoul eat it separately.

276
00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:50.735 line:80%
That's just wrong.

277
00:26:53.904 --> 00:26:54.739 line:80%
All right.

278
00:27:01.662 --> 00:27:03.831 line:80%
Eat it with the meat.

279
00:27:03.914 --> 00:27:04.915 line:80%
Okay.

280
00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:09.378 line:80%
How is it? Better, right?

281
00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:13.215 line:80%
It's nice and spicy.

282
00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:15.551 line:80%
Eat up.

283
00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:21.724 line:80%
Mr. Yu, when you date, do you say,
"Today marks day one."

284
00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:23.059 line:80%
Or things like that?

285
00:27:26.312 --> 00:27:28.564 line:80%
When will you stop calling me Mr. Yu?

286
00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:32.026 line:80%
Well...

287
00:27:32.777 --> 00:27:34.862 line:80%
Until you get promoted to director?

288
00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:38.324 line:80%
I'm just kidding.

289
00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:43.120 line:80%
What did your ex-girlfriends call you?

290
00:27:48.626 --> 00:27:51.379 line:80%
I didn't have to do any of that.

291
00:27:53.631 --> 00:27:55.883 line:80%
I don't remember what they called me.

292
00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.053 line:80%
It didn't matter.

293
00:28:26.914 --> 00:28:28.707 line:80%
The only name I know is this.

294
00:28:31.752 --> 00:28:34.839 line:80%
"Kang Ji-won."

295
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:37.925 line:80%
"Ji-won."

296
00:28:41.095 --> 00:28:42.555 line:80%
Only Kang Ji-won.

297
00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:24.138 line:80%
What's wrong with him?

298
00:29:24.221 --> 00:29:26.015 line:80%
Look at him. What's with him?

299
00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:27.349 line:80%
I don't know.

300
00:29:28.058 --> 00:29:29.143 line:80%
What?

301
00:29:29.727 --> 00:29:31.353 line:80%
Isn't he tired of it?

302
00:29:31.437 --> 00:29:33.147 line:80%
He hasn't changed a bit.

303
00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:41.363 line:80%
I'm here.

304
00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.165 line:80%
Hello, sir.

305
00:29:51.248 --> 00:29:55.544 line:80%
I'm Kim Tae-hyeong, and I have been
assigned to Marketing Team 1.

306
00:29:55.628 --> 00:29:56.754 line:80%
Nice to meet you.

307
00:29:57.463 --> 00:29:59.006 line:80%
Yeah.

308
00:29:59.089 --> 00:30:00.591 line:80%
I'm originally a manager.

309
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.012 line:80%
Hey, you're here.

310
00:30:06.013 --> 00:30:12.728 line:80%
Gosh, this chair recognizes its owner.
It fits my butt perfectly.

311
00:30:14.688 --> 00:30:16.023 line:80%
Ms. Yang.

312
00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.316 line:80%
No...

313
00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:21.028 line:80%
Manager Yang, you'll return it to me soon,

314
00:30:21.111 --> 00:30:23.239 line:80%
so use it carefully, okay?

315
00:30:24.198 --> 00:30:26.617 line:80%
-Hey. Work hard.
-Yes.

316
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.826 line:80%
Yes, sir.

317
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.584 line:80%
Assistant Manager Kim.

318
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.341 line:80%
Where's your proposal?

319
00:30:44.426 --> 00:30:45.594 line:80%
I said I'd do it...

320
00:30:46.387 --> 00:30:47.930 line:80%
What did you just say?

321
00:30:48.556 --> 00:30:52.851 line:80%
Your idea isn't that good,
so you should at least be diligent.

322
00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:55.521 line:80%
Oh, don't worry.

323
00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:56.897 line:80%
It doesn't suck.

324
00:30:57.815 --> 00:30:59.316 line:80%
It's just not that good.

325
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:03.153 line:80%
Are you insane?

326
00:31:03.237 --> 00:31:04.947 line:80%
What the hell are you doing?

327
00:31:05.614 --> 00:31:08.325 line:80%
You know hierarchy
better than anyone does.

328
00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:12.204 line:80%
You know how it works.
You're not the manager anymore.

329
00:31:12.288 --> 00:31:14.665 line:80%
But isn't sitting here uncomfortable?

330
00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:19.628 line:80%
I need to know your standards
in order to meet them.

331
00:31:24.258 --> 00:31:28.095 line:80%
Why are you speaking to me like that?
Where are your formalities?

332
00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:32.516 line:80%
That's how you spoke to me.
I figured it was okay.

333
00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:35.019 line:80%
I'm your boss now.

334
00:31:35.102 --> 00:31:38.606 line:80%
But I'm respectful while you're not.

335
00:31:39.273 --> 00:31:40.399 line:80%
It's strange.

336
00:31:41.442 --> 00:31:46.113 line:80%
So what shall we do?
Shall we both be more respectful? Or...

337
00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.325 line:80%
shall I speak casually to you?

338
00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:11.555 line:80%
Mr. Kim.

339
00:32:22.358 --> 00:32:25.694 line:80%
Surely, only men look after men.

340
00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:28.155 line:80%
These little chicks...

341
00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:31.742 line:80%
How dare these chicks try to break up
a male friendship?

342
00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:33.702 line:80%
-So cheeky.
-Right?

343
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.330 line:80%
Mr. Park.

344
00:32:36.413 --> 00:32:38.707 line:80%
Let's drink and go to a sauna tonight.

345
00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:41.919 line:80%
Ms. Yang's dad is buying
galbi
tonight...

346
00:32:44.171 --> 00:32:45.464 line:80%
But I can't go there.

347
00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:47.257 line:80%
I have plans at home. Sorry.

348
00:32:47.341 --> 00:32:49.218 line:80%
Really? Okay.

By the way,

350
00:32:53.847 --> 00:32:58.936 line:80%
you're not really in a relationship
with Su-min, are you?

351
00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:00.688 line:80%
No, sir.

352
00:33:02.272 --> 00:33:03.315 line:80%

Bye.

393
00:35:59.241 --> 00:36:00.242 line:80%
Honey.

394
00:36:01.702 --> 00:36:02.703 line:80%
Where were you?

395
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.746 line:80%
You could've said hi...

Seriously?

413
00:37:24.618 --> 00:37:26.119 line:80%
Damn it...

414
00:37:26.203 --> 00:37:27.621 line:80%
This sucks.

415
00:37:27.704 --> 00:37:29.331 line:80%
-I can't do it.
-I can't do it.

416
00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:30.958 line:80%
-What the hell?
-What?

417
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:32.918 line:80%

announcements and monetary gifts
are given.

479
00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:42.751 line:80%

480

And you need days off
to go on your honeymoon.

It's my wedding,
and I didn't say anything!

483
00:41:52.928 --> 00:41:54.763 line:80%
Did I ask you to announce it?

484
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.640 line:80%
This is insane.

485
00:41:58.183 --> 00:42:00.518 line:80%
It seems he's in a difficult position

486
00:42:00.602 --> 00:42:04.064 line:80%
because he's marrying
Ms. Kang Ji-won's friend.

487

But...

490
00:42:33.969 --> 00:42:37.264 line:80%
you don't seem like the type to meddle
with Min-hwan and Su-min.

491
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:41.726 line:80%
Scumbags like them
have nothing to do with you.

492
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:44.854 line:80%
If it concerns Ji-won, it concerns me.

493
00:43:04.082 --> 00:43:05.750 line:80%
He's laughing.

494
00:43:07.836 --> 00:43:11.131 line:80%
I've never seen him like that before.
It was touching.

495
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:12.924 line:80%
You?

496
00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:14.968 line:80%
That's not like you.

497
00:43:15.635 --> 00:43:18.555 line:80%
I saw him in a new light.

498
00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:22.809 line:80%
I understand your intent,

499
00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:26.813 line:80%
but Ji-hyuk was no fun at all.

500
00:43:28.273 --> 00:43:29.983 line:80%
He didn't want anything.

501
00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:32.068 line:80%
He suppressed his emotions.

502
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:36.156 line:80%
He had everything,
so he didn't really need me.

503
00:43:36.906 --> 00:43:38.283 line:80%
But this time...

504
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:46.499 line:80%
he seems like he's really living.
For the first time.

505
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:53.089 line:80%
Ji-hyuk, you sent it?

506
00:43:56.885 --> 00:43:58.219 line:80%
I couldn't stand it.

507
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:03.183 line:80%
SENDER: YU JI-HYUK
RECIPIENT: HR DIRECTOR

508
00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.227 line:80%
I admit that it was childish.

509
00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:13.318 line:80%
This is amazing.

510
00:44:14.694 --> 00:44:15.820 line:80%
What is?

511
00:44:18.907 --> 00:44:20.450 line:80%
That someone's on my side.

512
00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:24.621 line:80%
Someone to get mad about things for me.

513
00:44:30.835 --> 00:44:32.170 line:80%
What are you thinking?

514
00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:37.092 line:80%
I'm thinking about kissing you.

515
00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:39.386 line:80%
What?

516
00:44:39.803 --> 00:44:41.304 line:80%
Actually, more than that...

517
00:44:41.388 --> 00:44:42.931 line:80%
What's wrong with you?

518
00:44:58.029 --> 00:45:00.281 line:80%
-Damn it!
-My goodness!

519
00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:03.034 line:80%
What are you doing? She's pregnant!

520
00:45:03.118 --> 00:45:06.371 line:80%
Mom, please! You don't know anything.

521
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:08.790 line:80%
What is this?

522
00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:11.418 line:80%
Did you send the invitation to work?

523
00:45:12.168 --> 00:45:13.253 line:80%
Work?

524
00:45:16.965 --> 00:45:17.799 line:80%
What?

525
00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:24.055 line:80%
This is...

526
00:45:28.101 --> 00:45:30.603 line:80%
It was announced at work!

527
00:45:31.354 --> 00:45:32.355 line:80%
What?

528
00:45:32.439 --> 00:45:35.400 line:80%
Everyone knows we're getting married now.

529
00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:37.193 line:80%
How can I go to work?

530
00:45:37.277 --> 00:45:38.862 line:80%
How can I work there now?

531
00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.447 line:80%
God damn it!

532
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.116 line:80%
-You're so loud!
-Why can't you?

533
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:46.035 line:80%
What's the problem?
Is marrying me that bad?

534
00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:47.287 line:80%
Exactly!

535
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.832 line:80%
Things like this happen!
I thought there was big trouble.

536
00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:54.252 line:80%
Hey! I need to collect at your wedding!

537
00:45:55.336 --> 00:45:58.965 line:80%
Yeah, you're not alone now.
Think about our baby general.

538
00:45:59.048 --> 00:46:01.885 line:80%
Our baby, my foot!
Why's he holding me back?

539
00:46:01.968 --> 00:46:02.969 line:80%
Damn it!

540
00:46:03.052 --> 00:46:05.013 line:80%
You brat! That's my grandson!

541
00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:07.056 line:80%
Stop hitting me!

542
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.141 line:80%
Seriously?

543
00:46:08.224 --> 00:46:09.267 line:80%
What about me?

544
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.144 line:80%
This is hardest on me!

545
00:46:11.227 --> 00:46:12.729 line:80%
Damn it!

546
00:46:12.812 --> 00:46:15.440 line:80%
Go inside. This won't do.

547
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:17.817 line:80%
What's wrong with him?

548
00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:19.152 line:80%
He's so loud.

549
00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:21.070 line:80%
Be careful, sweetie.

550
00:46:21.154 --> 00:46:23.990 line:80%
It must be too loud for our baby general.

551
00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:28.578 line:80%
Listen. All men are children.

552
00:46:28.661 --> 00:46:32.123 line:80%
He'll go back to being normal
when he calms down.

553
00:46:32.207 --> 00:46:34.042 line:80%
So don't worry about a thing.

554
00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:36.753 line:80%
Just think about having a healthy baby.

555
00:46:38.713 --> 00:46:40.924 line:80%
I know he's hot-tempered.

556
00:46:43.676 --> 00:46:45.803 line:80%
Why don't you stay the night here?

557
00:46:45.887 --> 00:46:48.056 line:80%
No, I should go home.

558
00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:51.434 line:80%
This is supposed to be good for the baby.

559
00:46:52.477 --> 00:46:56.064 line:80%
It's great for brain development.
Listen to it before you go.

560
00:46:57.315 --> 00:46:58.316 line:80%
I'm off.

561
00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:30.723 line:80%
I thought about it,
and I want to go to this wedding.

562
00:47:31.224 --> 00:47:33.101 line:80%
I'll pay 1,000 won and eat a lot.

563
00:47:33.184 --> 00:47:34.978 line:80%
Yeah, I'm going too.

564
00:47:35.979 --> 00:47:38.690 line:80%
YU HUI-YEON

565
00:47:41.901 --> 00:47:43.194 line:80%
I want to live.

566
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:59.127 line:80%
KANG HYEON-MO
I LOVE YOU, DAD

567
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:39.751 line:80%
Hey.

568
00:49:16.621 --> 00:49:17.830 line:80%
Are you ready?

569
00:49:17.914 --> 00:49:20.041 line:80%
Yeah, almost. Just a second.

570
00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:22.043 line:80%
Ji-won, wait.

571
00:49:23.211 --> 00:49:24.712 line:80%
Can you sit for a second?

572
00:49:37.809 --> 00:49:38.810 line:80%
What's this?

573
00:49:41.938 --> 00:49:44.315 line:80%
Kang Ji-won deserves the best.

574
00:50:23.604 --> 00:50:25.815 line:80%

It's okay. You're pretty.

576
00:50:38.578 --> 00:50:40.538 line:80%
I'm getting a family.

577
00:50:42.248 --> 00:50:45.585 line:80%
I won.

578
00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:50.673 line:80%
Hey!

579
00:50:51.257 --> 00:50:52.341 line:80%
Mother.

580
00:50:54.802 --> 00:50:57.388 line:80%
Is my stomach poking out?

581
00:50:57.472 --> 00:51:01.225 line:80%
It'd better not. That's why
we're having this shotgun wedding.

582
00:51:01.726 --> 00:51:04.437 line:80%
By the way, where are your friends?

583
00:51:04.937 --> 00:51:07.940 line:80%
Are you sure you told them the right time?

584
00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:10.151 line:80%
Well... Yes.

585
00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:13.196 line:80%
Oh, your mother's here.
Shall we take a picture?

586
00:51:13.279 --> 00:51:15.490 line:80%
No, this is my mother-in-law.

587
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.868 line:80%
I look good in pink.

588
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:21.704 line:80%
Isn't this color so beautiful?

589
00:51:21.788 --> 00:51:23.998 line:80%
Yes, you look beautiful.

590
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:25.166 line:80%
Thanks.

591
00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:26.959 line:80%
-Let's sit down.
-Okay.

592
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.384 line:80%
The wedding dress is a little...

593
00:51:36.052 --> 00:51:38.179 line:80%
Just take the picture.

594
00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:41.933 line:80%
Her bump isn't showing yet,
but it's best we leave no records.

595
00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:43.518 line:80%
Just take it.

596
00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:44.602 line:80%
Now.

597
00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:46.354 line:80%
Yes, I understand.

598
00:51:46.896 --> 00:51:48.064 line:80%
Smile.

599
00:51:50.817 --> 00:51:52.401 line:80%
-Hey...
-Yes?

600
00:51:52.485 --> 00:51:54.362 line:80%
Where's your mother?

601
00:51:56.823 --> 00:51:58.157 line:80%
Hello!

602
00:52:00.243 --> 00:52:03.120 line:80%
I'm sorry I'm so late.

00:52:03.704 --> 00:52:05.164 line:80%
Hello.

604
00:52:06.165 --> 00:52:09.335 line:80%
There must've been a lot of traffic.

605
00:52:09.418 --> 00:52:11.212 line:80%
Yes, there was.

606
00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:14.048 line:80%
I only lived in Busan.

607
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:17.385 line:80%
Seoul's traffic surprised me.

608
00:52:23.099 --> 00:52:26.435 line:80%
Su-min, you look so pretty.

609
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.606 line:80%
I'm sorry I'm late.

CROWN WEDDING HALL

611
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:36.988 line:80%
Why are you so late, ma'am?
I told you to come early.

612
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.031 line:80%
Sorry.

613
00:52:39.115 --> 00:52:40.950 line:80%
There was so much traffic.

614
00:52:41.033 --> 00:52:43.286 line:80%
There was an accident near here.

615
00:52:43.369 --> 00:52:44.912 line:80%
Whatever.

616
00:52:44.996 --> 00:52:48.791 line:80%
Do you remember everything?
My dad passed away. You're a teacher.

617
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:50.209 line:80%
Of course.

618
00:52:50.293 --> 00:52:54.547 line:80%
He ran a business, left a lot of wealth,
and I'm set for my later life.

619
00:52:56.048 --> 00:52:59.218 line:80%
What about friends?
For 11 people, 300,000 won each, right?

620
00:52:59.302 --> 00:53:02.138 line:80%
Hello! Thank you.

621
00:53:02.221 --> 00:53:03.764 line:80%
Hello.

622
00:53:04.891 --> 00:53:07.476 line:80%

-Hey.
-Hey.

624
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.607 line:80%
You're going after all.
You said she wasn't the wife type.

625
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.525 line:80%
Thank you.

626
00:53:14.609 --> 00:53:16.152 line:80%
Stop that!

627
00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:19.155 line:80%
Did you come alone? Where are the others?

628
00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:21.073 line:80%
You know Yun-gyeong's temper.

629
00:53:21.157 --> 00:53:25.870 line:80%
She won't come to a cheater's wedding.
The other girls wouldn't come either.

630
00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:29.206 line:80%
Jong-chan's on a business trip.
Yong-gu will be at the reception.

631
00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:32.376 line:80%
Reception? That useless bastard.

632
00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:40.593 line:80%
Wow. Who are they?

633
00:53:42.053 --> 00:53:43.554 line:80%
Friends of the bride?

634
00:54:06.786 --> 00:54:07.787 line:80%
Congratulations.

635
00:54:10.081 --> 00:54:12.833 line:80%
I think you should keep this to yourself.

636
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:17.630 line:80%
You came.

637
00:54:18.297 --> 00:54:19.298 line:80%
You look pretty.

638
00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:24.303 line:80%
But this... You didn't have to.

639
00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:29.225 line:80%
You'll eat before you go, right?

640
00:54:37.525 --> 00:54:39.193 line:80%
Wait, that's...

641
00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:41.404 line:80%
Let's go.

642
00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:52.915 line:80%
I thought I'd seen her before.

643
00:54:52.999 --> 00:54:55.459 line:80%
Is that your ex-girlfriend? Kang Ji-won?

644
00:54:56.752 --> 00:54:58.295 line:80%
What? She's a goddess.

645
00:55:00.423 --> 00:55:03.217 line:80%
You got dumped, didn't you?
I thought you dumped her.

646
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.220 line:80%
Damn you! Stop talking!

647
00:55:08.139 --> 00:55:09.348 line:80%
You're so annoying.

648
00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:13.060 line:80%
COMPLAINT

649
00:55:13.144 --> 00:55:14.645 line:80%
What's this?

650
00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:19.400 line:80%
Are you sued? Did you borrow money?

651
00:55:30.953 --> 00:55:32.621 line:80%
You'll be entering soon.

652
00:55:33.414 --> 00:55:34.415 line:80%
Okay.

653
00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:41.422 line:80%
That's okay.

654
00:55:54.727 --> 00:55:56.187 line:80%
Why are you so late?

655
00:55:56.771 --> 00:55:58.481 line:80%
I thought you weren't coming.

656
00:56:22.421 --> 00:56:24.423 line:80%
You caught my bouquet.

657
00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.093 line:80%
What?

658
00:56:30.054 --> 00:56:32.640 line:80%
Come on. You want the bouquet?
That's not right.

659
00:56:33.516 --> 00:56:36.268 line:80%
Min-hwan's parents know your face.

660
00:56:38.437 --> 00:56:39.522 line:80%
That's true.

661
00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:43.025 line:80%
The dress looks good on you.

662
00:56:47.613 --> 00:56:50.658 line:80%
Right? My mother-in-law picked it for me.

663
00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:56.080 line:80%
It's a little disappointing,
but the elders like it, so what can I do?

664
00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:58.124 line:80%
She thinks of me as her daughter.

665
00:57:01.877 --> 00:57:03.587 line:80%
I'm glad you two get along.

666
00:57:06.674 --> 00:57:09.718 line:80%
Let's take a picture.
Call the photographer.

667
00:57:10.261 --> 00:57:11.137 line:80%
No.

668
00:57:12.012 --> 00:57:14.557 line:80%
I don't think that's necessary.

669
00:57:24.692 --> 00:57:25.651 line:80%
Congratulations...

670
00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:29.530 line:80%
on picking up

671
00:57:31.824 --> 00:57:33.701 line:80%
my trash.

672
00:57:44.545 --> 00:57:46.505 line:80%
Park Min-hwan bought me this.

673
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:53.053 line:80%
So use it or sell it,
do whatever you want with it.

674
00:58:12.031 --> 00:58:13.282 line:80%
Trash?

675
00:58:14.283 --> 00:58:15.910 line:80%
She threw Min-hwan away?

676
00:58:16.619 --> 00:58:18.621 line:80%
Damn it. Wow, items are free.

677
00:58:19.914 --> 00:58:21.957 line:80%
How can I work there now?

678
00:58:22.583 --> 00:58:25.252 line:80%
No, that's not possible.

679
00:58:25.753 --> 00:58:27.421 line:80%
I'm marrying Min-hwan.

680
00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:29.381 line:80%
I'll start a new family.

681
00:58:29.465 --> 00:58:31.926 line:80%
I can't be tied to you forever.

682
00:58:33.302 --> 00:58:34.803 line:80%
You're entering soon.

683
00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:38.807 line:80%
Now, it's time to meet
the beautiful bride.

684
00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:40.267 line:80%
-Okay.
-Let's greet her with

685
00:58:40.351 --> 00:58:41.602 line:80%
a round of applause.

686
00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:45.481 line:80%
No, I stole them. The man and family
that used to be Ji-won's.

687
00:58:45.564 --> 00:58:46.941 line:80%
They're all mine now.

688
00:58:47.942 --> 00:58:49.860 line:80%
I won.

689
00:58:50.444 --> 00:58:53.197 line:80%
I'm starting over now.

690
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.790 line:80%
The groom, Park Min-hwan,
and the bride, Jeong Su-min,

691
01:00:26.874 --> 01:00:30.627 line:80%
will be wed in the presence
of their family and friends today...

692
01:00:55.194 --> 01:00:56.862 line:80%
Let's smile a little, ma'am.

693
01:00:57.363 --> 01:00:58.364 line:80%
Okay, good.

694
01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:04.745 line:80%
Jeong Su-min doesn't look like
her mom at all, right?

695
01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:06.455 line:80%
She must look like her dad.

696
01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:08.499 line:80%
You're right.

697
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.084 line:80%
I'll take two more.

698
01:01:10.626 --> 01:01:14.004 line:80%
Let's all smile. Sir, smile.

699
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.049 line:80%
I guess you haven't seen her.

700
01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:22.596 line:80%
People hire guests these days.
Do you think she hired her?

701
01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:24.807 line:80%
Come on.

702
01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.726 line:80%
But if my memory's correct,

703
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.479 line:80%
Jeong Su-min's mom is still alive.

704
01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:35.192 line:80%
Eun-ho, what are you doing here?

705
01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:38.153 line:80%
Su-min sent me the wedding invitation.

706
01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.451 line:80%
But the problem is...

707
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.831 line:80%
Could the friends of the bride and groom
come out now?

708
01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:00.467 line:80%
I showed it to Ye-ji,

709
01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.180 line:80%
and they came looking like that.

710
01:02:05.264 --> 01:02:06.265 line:80%
Wait!

711
01:02:06.974 --> 01:02:10.394 line:80%
-The bride's old friends are here!
-Here!

712
01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:17.568 line:80%
They're sorry,
so they'll take revenge for you.

713
01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:24.241 line:80%
Are they your friends?

714
01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:26.410 line:80%
No...

715
01:02:27.453 --> 01:02:29.288 line:80%
Su-min, I'm here.

716
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.582 line:80%
Who's getting the bouquet? Shall I?

717
01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.793 line:80%
Ji-won may be your other half,

718
01:02:34.877 --> 01:02:37.713 line:80%
but you're marrying her man after all.

719
01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:40.382 line:80%
How could she catch the bouquet for you?

720
01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.342 line:80%
Is that true?

721
01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:44.470 line:80%
She stole her friend's man?

722
01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.391 line:80%
Who else did you send the invitation to?

723
01:02:51.018 --> 01:02:52.102 line:80%
Take care of this.

724
01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:57.900 line:80%
What do you think you're doing?

725
01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:02.446 line:80%
Who are you people?

726
01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.949 line:80%
-I should say hi to her.
-No...

727
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.789 line:80%
I'm Su-min's best friend. The left ball!

728
01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:16.293 line:80%
Let go of me.

729
01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.462 line:80%
What... Where are your manners?

730
01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.673 line:80%
I'm her other best friend. The right ball.

731
01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:24.843 line:80%
Where did these vulgar people come from?

732
01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:28.430 line:80%
Vulgar?

733
01:03:28.514 --> 01:03:30.015 line:80%
What are you thinking?

734
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:35.896 line:80%
We're like her eyeballs.
And we're the apple of each other's eyes.

735
01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.900 line:80%
Come on!
Were you thinking about something vulgar?

736
01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.443 line:80%
I'm the nose!

737
01:03:41.527 --> 01:03:44.738 line:80%
They're the right and left balls,
and I'm the nose.

738
01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:48.242 line:80%
Do you know whose family wedding this is?

739
01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:53.705 line:80%
The family who raised a dog that
cheated on his girlfriend with her bestie.

740
01:03:54.373 --> 01:03:57.125 line:80%
But if there's more to know, enlighten me.

741
01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:59.419 line:80%
What did you just say?

742
01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:01.213 line:80%
How dare you?

743
01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:04.883 line:80%
Stop! Mother!

744
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.136 line:80%
How dare you!

745
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.058 line:80%
-Mother!
-Kick them out!

746
01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.567 line:80%
Where's Min-hwan?

747
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:24.027 line:80%
Calm down, everyone.

748
01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:25.862 line:80%
Nothing's wrong.

749
01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:29.616 line:80%
Let's finish the wedding.
Where's the groom?

750
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.701 line:80%
Min-hwan!

751
01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:33.453 line:80%
You've got great friends.

752
01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:37.791 line:80%
They were amazing too
when they bullied me.

753
01:04:42.004 --> 01:04:43.672 line:80%
If you're tired, shall we go?

754
01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:45.382 line:80%
Shall we?

755
01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:47.926 line:80%
You two can talk later.

756
01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:52.848 line:80%
Yeah, you two. I'll call you later.

757
01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.766 line:80%
Yeah, okay.

758
01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:58.395 line:80%
Aren't you going to eat?
I paid 1,000 won for a meal ticket.

759
01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.148 line:80%
Let's go.

760
01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:11.241 line:80%
He must've made up his mind.

761
01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:13.619 line:80%
Are you okay?

762
01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:17.748 line:80%
I'm going to eat. Do you want to join me?

763
01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:22.669 line:80%
If you're okay with somewhere else,
I'll buy.

764
01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:25.422 line:80%
Of course! Sounds great.

765
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:32.220 line:80%
But my manager was supposed to come too.

766
01:05:33.305 --> 01:05:34.389 line:80%
Where is she?

767
01:05:46.318 --> 01:05:48.278 line:80%
I told you not to come back here.

768
01:05:51.782 --> 01:05:53.867 line:80%
It's the weekend. Why are you here?

769
01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:01.750 line:80%
I can't go home right now.

770
01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:07.255 line:80%
Yeon-ji's at home.

771
01:06:09.216 --> 01:06:13.053 line:80%
And I haven't gotten myself sorted yet.

772
01:06:16.515 --> 01:06:18.308 line:80%
I've been so busy.

773
01:06:20.686 --> 01:06:24.648 line:80%
So I didn't get a chance
to hear the checkup results.

774
01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.903 line:80%
And I heard it over the phone.

775
01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:33.073 line:80%
Calm down and speak clearly.

776
01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:34.658 line:80%
No...

777
01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:37.327 line:80%
Let's just leave here.

778
01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:44.960 line:80%
I have stomach cancer.

779
01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.931 line:80%
Great job. Go and rest.

780
01:07:40.015 --> 01:07:41.057 line:80%
You too.

781
01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.865 line:80%
I came to talk for a moment.

782
01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.536 line:80%
But this is awkward.

783
01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:10.712 line:80%
Hello.

784
01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:12.964 line:80%
I'm Yu Ji-hyuk's fiancée.

785
01:08:16.635 --> 01:08:19.721 line:80%
Wait... Ex-fiancée, I guess?

786
01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:24.184 line:80%
Since he called off the engagement.

787
01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:27.604 line:80%
I didn't know it was
because he had a woman.

788
01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:04.099 line:80%
Did you ever hear that I was married?

789
01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:07.769 line:80%
How would it feel to have my boyfriend
marry my best friend?

790
01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:10.230 line:80%
What do we do?
Ms. Yang has stomach cancer.

791
01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:11.314 line:80%
It's my fault.

792
01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:13.483 line:80%
My fate went to her.

793
01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.986 line:80%
I know Mr. Yu's a good person.

794
01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.612 line:80%
This is my fault.

795
01:09:18.655 --> 01:09:19.656 line:80%
Park Min-hwan?

796
01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:21.950 line:80%
She dumps Min-hwan on me

797
01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.452 line:80%
and goes for a rich man?

798
01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:29.958 line:80%
I don't like anyone touching what's mine.

799
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:33.920 line:80%
I realized I dreamed
of something too happy.

800
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.761 line:80%
