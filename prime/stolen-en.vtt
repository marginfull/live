00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.747 line:80%
Hey! Watch it!

2
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.716 line:80%
Gautam.

3
00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:03.555 line:80%
Hi baby.

4
00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:05.180 line:80%
Your uncle from
Seattle is at reception...

5
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.180 line:80%
...and the hotel has no room.

6
00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:10.044 line:80%
Please talk to this guy.
It’s getting very awkward.

7
00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:12.305 line:80%
Yeah, hello.

8
00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:16.555 line:80%
Sir, your wife is set on 405.
But it’s occupied.

9
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.430 line:80%
We moved the 601 guests to 405.

10
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.055 line:80%
Champa.

11
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.180 line:80%
Champa.

12
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.680 line:80%
Champa.

13
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.805 line:80%
Champa.

14
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.075 line:80%
That’s my baby’s cap.
Where’s my baby?

15
00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.555 line:80%
Babe, you found Rambo?

16
00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.430 line:80%
I’ll check on the platform.

17
00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:45.655 line:80%
This after party is so not lit
without your moves.

18
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.305 line:80%
It's all thanks to him that
she insisted I go.

19
00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:50.305 line:80%
Just get Rambo fast.

20
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.055 line:80%
Yeah, I'll bring that killjoy...

21
00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:53.805 line:80%
Get off me!

22
00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:56.430 line:80%
You piece of shit!
You’re not going anywhere.

23
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.055 line:80%
Who the hell are you?

24
00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:00.940 line:80%
It’s been hard on him babe.
Don’t be so negative.

25
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:04.930 line:80%
I’m not... he has to move on.
I hate his celebration of depression.

26
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.555 line:80%
Whose line is that?

27
00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:07.555 line:80%
It's mine.

28
00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:08.430 line:80%
Yeah, sure.

29
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.680 line:80%
Why can’t it be mine?

30
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.055 line:80%
Tell someone else.

31
00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:13.620 line:80%
Wait a sec... Indu.
I’ll call you back.

32
00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:16.503 line:80%
What the hell man!

33
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:18.190 line:80%
That’s my brother.

34
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:19.805 line:80%
Get off him.

35
00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:21.680 line:80%
Raman. What happened?

36
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.805 line:80%
Your brother has stolen
this woman’s baby.

37
00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:25.930 line:80%
Don’t talk shit.

38
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.055 line:80%
What’s happened, bro?

39
00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:30.680 line:80%
I found this cap on the ground.
Now they think I’ve stolen the baby.

40
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.680 line:80%
It was in his hand.

41
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.430 line:80%
A woman bumped into
me and dropped the cap.

42
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.555 line:80%
What’s this racket?

43
00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.430 line:80%
- It’s a misunderstanding...
- Get back.

44
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.430 line:80%
Sir. This man has stolen my daughter.
Her cap was in his hands.

45
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.180 line:80%
The cap fell when he
bumped into a woman.

46
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.930 line:80%
Woman?

47
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.430 line:80%
That woman dropped the cap.

48
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.430 line:80%
Which woman?

49
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.305 line:80%
Do you know her?

50
00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:49.055 line:80%
How the hell would I?

51
00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:50.180 line:80%
He doesn’t know her.

52
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.930 line:80%
Shut up.

53
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.680 line:80%
You, come here.

54
00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:55.055 line:80%
Listen to me.
Just calm down please.

55
00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:57.328 line:80%
Sir, I just got off the train.

56
00:03:57.353 --> 00:04:00.305 line:80%
I left my phone to charge and
waited for my brother.

57
00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:02.055 line:80%
I bought biscuits and...

58
00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:03.180 line:80%
You can ask him.

59
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.430 line:80%
I bought biscuits from you, right?

60
00:04:06.055 --> 00:04:07.930 line:80%
Yes.
He did buy biscuits.

61
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.680 line:80%
Did you see me with a baby?

62
00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:11.305 line:80%
- No.
- See?

63
00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:13.305 line:80%
Did you see anything else?

64
00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:16.430 line:80%
Which idiot would stick around
after stealing a baby?

65
00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:18.805 line:80%
- She’s long gone.
- Call the police.

66
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:20.305 line:80%
Champaa...

67
00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:21.930 line:80%
Oh god!

68
00:04:22.182 --> 00:04:24.555 line:80%
Someone help her.

69
00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:26.555 line:80%
She took my baby.

70
00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:30.530 line:80%
Take her to the bench.

71
00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:32.430 line:80%
My baby... I lost her.

72
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.805 line:80%
You lot don’t think
before mobbing someone.

73
00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:37.963 line:80%
Don’t lose hope.

74
00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:39.555 line:80%
Don’t crowd around her.

75
00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:41.680 line:80%
Move from here.

76
00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:44.305 line:80%
Let’s quickly get out of here.

77
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.409 line:80%
Bloody savages!
Out for a pound of flesh.

78
00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:48.284 line:80%
You two.

79
00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:49.805 line:80%
Come here.

80
00:04:49.836 --> 00:04:50.961 line:80%
What is it, sir?

81
00:04:51.163 --> 00:04:52.038 line:80%
I said, come here.

82
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.930 line:80%
It’s all sorted.
What now?

83
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.430 line:80%
He is the only witness.

84
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.430 line:80%
The police are coming.
They’ll take his statement.

85
00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:00.555 line:80%
You take it.

86
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.055 line:80%
I can’t take it.

87
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.680 line:80%
Please take it, sir.

88
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.463 line:80%
You’re on duty.
We’re in a hurry.

89
00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:06.818 line:80%
I don’t have the authority.

90
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.535 line:80%
I’ve called the local police.
It’s their job.

91
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.055 line:80%
You do have the authority, Sir.

92
00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:12.430 line:80%
Come. Let’s talk privately...

93
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.805 line:80%
What’s this arrogance?

94
00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:15.180 line:80%
You should be ashamed.

95
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.180 line:80%
Of a chat?

96
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.042 line:80%
Bloody talking nonsense.

97
00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.155 line:80%
Just wanted to chat.

98
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.565 line:80%
A woman has lost her baby.
And you...

99
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.215 line:80%
Sir, how much time will it take?

100
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.930 line:80%
It will take as long as it takes.

101
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.805 line:80%
Cooperate with the police.

102
00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:28.112 line:80%
- Okay, Sir.
- You look like decent folk.

103
00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:29.428 line:80%
Such nonsense doesn't suit you.

104
00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:30.625 line:80%
Sir...

105
00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:33.685 line:80%
Don’t crowd now.

106
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:36.680 line:80%
Did you see my baby?

107
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.680 line:80%
- No, sorry.
- She's very young.

108
00:05:41.305 --> 00:05:42.930 line:80%
We’re stuck in this mess, man.

109
00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:47.430 line:80%
Why did it have to be today?

110
00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:50.555 line:80%
Mum’s going to stress.

111
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.805 line:80%
We’ll tell her that
the train is late.

112
00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:54.430 line:80%
Well, it was late.

113
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.180 line:80%
Tea?

114
00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:07.773 line:80%
Tequila?

115
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.680 line:80%
Come on. I’ve got some.

116
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.411 line:80%
Someone stole Champa from
the railway station.

117
00:06:43.378 --> 00:06:46.360 line:80%
I can’t live without her, Geetu.

118
00:06:51.737 --> 00:06:57.805 line:80%
I’ll jump in front of the train.

119
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.055 line:80%
My baby’s gone.

120
00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:06.305 line:80%
I couldn’t do anything.

121
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.305 line:80%
It’s better I die.

122
00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.805 line:80%
Jhumpa, you can't go crazy.

123
00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:16.180 line:80%
Just listen to me.
Stop crying.

124
00:07:18.055 --> 00:07:20.555 line:80%
Go search for her.
You'll find her.

125
00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:23.805 line:80%
There's no time to cry. Get up.

126
00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:26.055 line:80%
Ask people, search for her.
Don't give up.

127
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:28.805 line:80%
The police will not help you.

128
00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:31.180 line:80%
You have to look for Champa.

129
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.180 line:80%
She has no one else.

130
00:07:33.835 --> 00:07:36.904 line:80%
I'll go ask your brother for help.

131
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.055 line:80%
Don't worry. I'm with you.

132
00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:41.305 line:80%
Go now.

133
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:10.280 line:80%
- The train hasn't arrived?
- Wow, Mum. Looking beautiful.

134
00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:11.510 line:80%
Don’t change the topic.

135
00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:13.160 line:80%
His phone is also switched off.

136
00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:14.935 line:80%
I’ll message once he's here.

137
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.460 line:80%
Just catch some sleep.
The event is in a few hours.

138
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:18.156 line:80%
Okay.

139
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.430 line:80%
But please don’t forget to call me.

140
00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:22.336 line:80%
Don’t worry, Mum. Go to bed.

141
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.180 line:80%
Make sure you call.

142
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.180 line:80%
Yeah, sure.
Give the phone to Indu.

143
00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:28.241 line:80%
Hey, what’s up?

144
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.930 line:80%
Did she say anything?

145
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:34.891 line:80%
She wanted both her sons
to be there for her cocktail.

146
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.180 line:80%
What else?

147
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.055 line:80%
She's the one who
forced me to leave.

148
00:08:40.422 --> 00:08:42.422 line:80%
With Mum, it’s always
emotional blackmail.

149
00:08:47.289 --> 00:08:48.289 line:80%
What do you want?

150
00:08:49.937 --> 00:08:52.937 line:80%
You must have seen that woman?

151
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.680 line:80%
No, I didn’t.

152
00:08:57.555 --> 00:08:58.930 line:80%
She went right past you.

153
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.555 line:80%
I’m not a watchman.

154
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.055 line:80%
Sir, surely you saw her?

155
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.680 line:80%
No, she rushed away quickly.

156
00:09:19.854 --> 00:09:21.930 line:80%
I saw her shawl.

157
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.930 line:80%
It was grey. Like cement.

158
00:09:24.384 --> 00:09:25.634 line:80%
That’s it.

159
00:09:27.055 --> 00:09:30.555 line:80%
But her nose was very long.
I remember that.

160
00:09:30.555 --> 00:09:31.805 line:80%
It was quite...

161
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.430 line:80%
...quite unusual.

162
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.680 line:80%
What’s up?

163
00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:41.109 line:80%
Long, like a parrot’s beak.

164
00:09:42.055 --> 00:09:42.930 line:80%
Quite long.

165
00:09:43.773 --> 00:09:44.523 line:80%
Sir.

166
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.430 line:80%
Will you help me?

167
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.930 line:80%
Yeah, sure.

168
00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:51.003 line:80%
Take this.

169
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.305 line:80%
Put it away.

170
00:09:52.305 --> 00:09:53.680 line:80%
Not this.

171
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680 line:80%
Keep it.

172
00:09:55.452 --> 00:09:56.452 line:80%
What?

173
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.930 line:80%
Stop it, bro!

174
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.180 line:80%
Look at that attitude.

175
00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:05.135 line:80%
What are you doing?

176
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.180 line:80%
She wanted help.
I gave her money.

177
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.805 line:80%
Exactly. She asked for help.

178
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.805 line:80%
Money is key at such times.

179
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.180 line:80%
What?

180
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:14.406 line:80%
Nothing.

181
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.405 line:80%
What’s taking you so long?

182
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.055 line:80%
It’s done, Sir.

183
00:10:20.128 --> 00:10:24.180 line:80%
Sir, she’s not thinking straight.

184
00:10:25.805 --> 00:10:27.180 line:80%
Don't worry.

185
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.930 line:80%
I will tell the police...

186
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.680 line:80%
...that another woman stole the baby.

187
00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:38.180 line:80%
- I don’t have change.
- Keep it.

188
00:10:42.055 --> 00:10:44.055 line:80%
Dark complexion.
Five foot tall.

189
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.955 line:80%
Grey shawl.

190
00:10:46.382 --> 00:10:49.632 line:80%
Parrot beak nose.
Anything else?

191
00:10:50.468 --> 00:10:53.593 line:80%
Sir, that’s all we know.

192
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.430 line:80%
Can we leave?

193
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.930 line:80%
Go, if you’re in such a rush.

194
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.680 line:80%
No, Sir. I can't leave my brother.

195
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.555 line:80%
And skip the statement?

196
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.805 line:80%
Sir, I didn't mean...

197
00:11:07.562 --> 00:11:08.062 line:80%
Yeah, you.

198
00:11:08.508 --> 00:11:09.008 line:80%
What’s your name?

199
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.930 line:80%
Sir, Raman Bansal.
I just told you.

200
00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:13.805 line:80%
What do you do?

201
00:11:14.305 --> 00:11:15.555 line:80%
I'm a photographer.

202
00:11:15.805 --> 00:11:16.930 line:80%
Of what?

203
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.805 line:80%
Sir, he's a freelancer.
For different magazines...

204
00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:19.305 line:80%
Shut up!

205
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.555 line:80%
How does my job
affect the case?

206
00:11:26.305 --> 00:11:27.555 line:80%
Let me decide that.

207
00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:32.055 line:80%
Where were you at the
time of the crime?

208
00:11:52.305 --> 00:11:53.305 line:80%
Hello.

209
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.680 line:80%
Hello.

210
00:11:58.555 --> 00:12:00.555 line:80%
I need to tell you something.

211
00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.555 line:80%
Aye... where’s the baby’s mother?

212
00:12:04.471 --> 00:12:06.305 line:80%
She was around just now.

213
00:12:07.522 --> 00:12:08.522 line:80%
Here at the platform.

214
00:12:08.632 --> 00:12:09.382 line:80%
Panditji.

215
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.055 line:80%
Clearly, she doesn't care.

216
00:12:14.578 --> 00:12:15.328 line:80%
Anyway.

217
00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:17.930 line:80%
Why didn’t you run
after the woman?

218
00:12:19.546 --> 00:12:22.546 line:80%
I didn't know she was a kidnapper
or I would’ve stopped her.

219
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.680 line:80%
What are you two doing here?

220
00:12:28.929 --> 00:12:30.804 line:80%
Sir, what does one do
at a railway station?

221
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.805 line:80%
What does one do?

222
00:12:34.849 --> 00:12:36.930 line:80%
- Tell me.
- Sir actually...

223
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:37.930 line:80%
No. We don't know.

224
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.055 line:80%
Do enlighten us.

225
00:12:39.055 --> 00:12:41.302 line:80%
Sir, he missed his flight and
had to rush by train.

226
00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.702 line:80%
- What was the name?
- Pathankot.

227
00:12:42.727 --> 00:12:44.055 line:80%
He came on the
Pathankot express.

228
00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.430 line:80%
I’m his elder brother.
Came to pick him up.

229
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.680 line:80%
His train was also delayed...
We're going to a wedding.

230
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:51.805 line:80%
Your wedding?

231
00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:52.680 line:80%
No, Sir.

232
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.555 line:80%
Then?

233
00:12:57.805 --> 00:12:59.088 line:80%
Whose wedding is it?

234
00:12:59.113 --> 00:12:59.738 line:80%
Mother's.

235
00:13:01.555 --> 00:13:02.805 line:80%
Whose mother's?

236
00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:05.805 line:80%
Our mother's.
Do you have a problem?

237
00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:07.680 line:80%
Let’s stick to the point.

238
00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:11.930 line:80%
Sir, we’ve been here a long time.
He's tired.

239
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.305 line:80%
We’ve done nothing wrong.
You know that.

240
00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:15.180 line:80%
Mr. Bansal.

241
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.555 line:80%
Around here, it’s fists before facts.

242
00:13:20.055 --> 00:13:20.680 line:80%
Understood?

243
00:13:22.055 --> 00:13:24.305 line:80%
- No mercy for outsiders here.
- Got it, Sir.

244
00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:26.280 line:80%
Leave me. Get away.

245
00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.555 line:80%
He's running away.

246
00:13:29.294 --> 00:13:30.680 line:80%
Hey... stop.

247
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.930 line:80%
- Sir, she is lying.
- I overheard him.

248
00:13:34.482 --> 00:13:37.680 line:80%
This crazy woman scratched my face.

249
00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:40.430 line:80%
He's mixed up with that woman.

250
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.055 line:80%
Sir, I’m just a tea seller.

251
00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.430 line:80%
He’s stolen my baby.

252
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.305 line:80%
He called his accomplice.

253
00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:46.805 line:80%
And warned her.
I heard.

254
00:13:46.805 --> 00:13:49.430 line:80%
I was just telling my
friend about the kidnapping.

255
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.779 line:80%
She attacked me for no reason.

256
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:54.180 line:80%
She did accuse him before.

257
00:13:54.404 --> 00:13:55.805 line:80%
You're all involved.

258
00:13:56.055 --> 00:13:57.832 line:80%
Hey. Calm down.

259
00:13:57.857 --> 00:14:00.555 line:80%
Or we can’t help you.

260
00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:01.805 line:80%
Sir, I think she's right.

261
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.055 line:80%
I also have my doubts about him.

262
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.305 line:80%
See?

263
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.430 line:80%
What are you doing, Raman?

264
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.055 line:80%
Actually, she’s right.
Why did you hide your phone?

265
00:14:09.055 --> 00:14:10.555 line:80%
I was just making tea.

266
00:14:10.555 --> 00:14:13.430 line:80%
He suddenly hid his phone
when I caught him listening.

267
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.430 line:80%
Don't get involved.

268
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.180 line:80%
He's lying.

269
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:15.805 line:80%
Let him.

270
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.180 line:80%
Just call his last dialed number.
Then we’ll know.

271
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.055 line:80%
Keep quiet.

272
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.305 line:80%
Make the call.

273
00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:30.555 line:80%
Sir, I don't have balance.

274
00:14:30.555 --> 00:14:35.555 line:80%
The bloody liar!
He is clearly involved.

275
00:14:37.297 --> 00:14:41.430 line:80%
I made a mistake. Forgive me, Sir.
Please have mercy.

276
00:14:44.805 --> 00:14:46.055 line:80%
What's her name?

277
00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:49.997 line:80%
Surili.

278
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.305 line:80%
We met a month ago.

279
00:14:52.536 --> 00:14:56.865 line:80%
I just had to tip her off
and get 5,000 per baby.

280
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.430 line:80%
You jerk. How many
babies did you steal?

281
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.055 line:80%
I swear it’s my first time, Sir.
Forgive me, Sir.

282
00:15:05.055 --> 00:15:07.930 line:80%
If she’s not found,
you’re the fall guy.

283
00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:14.740 line:80%
I overheard her call
someone to the Cursed Manor.

284
00:15:14.765 --> 00:15:16.765 line:80%
Don’t talk shit!

285
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.305 line:80%
No one is stupid enough
to go to that cursed place.

286
00:15:21.312 --> 00:15:26.180 line:80%
I swear, Sir. I heard her.
She is hiding there.

287
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.680 line:80%
You think we’re fools
who’ll believe anything?

288
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.531 line:80%
I am not lying, Sir.

289
00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:37.094 line:80%
Sir, he’s bluffing.

290
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:40.555 line:80%
That woman won't stick around.

291
00:15:41.055 --> 00:15:45.030 line:80%
Officer, let’s go.
Champa is there. You heard...

292
00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:46.055 line:80%
Go where?

293
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.680 line:80%
The Cursed Manor...

294
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.820 line:80%
We need to file a report
at the station first...

295
00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:53.305 line:80%
We can do that later.
First, we need to find Champa...

296
00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:55.430 line:80%
You were snoring when
the baby was picked up.

297
00:15:57.805 --> 00:15:58.805 line:80%
Just shut up now.

298
00:15:58.805 --> 00:16:00.094 line:80%
She's right, Sir.

299
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.359 line:80%
Are you her lawyer?

300
00:16:01.384 --> 00:16:03.680 line:80%
She’s not wrong though.
You should leave right now.

301
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.805 line:80%
What are you doing?

302
00:16:04.805 --> 00:16:06.805 line:80%
- Don't meddle in my work!
- Exactly!

303
00:16:06.805 --> 00:16:08.680 line:80%
Why are you getting aggressive?

304
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.805 line:80%
Wanna see me aggressive?

305
00:16:09.805 --> 00:16:12.555 line:80%
- Let them do their job.
- They are wasting time.

306
00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.180 line:80%
You think we are wasting time?

307
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.180 line:80%
Sir, he didn't mean that...

308
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.055 line:80%
It is time wasting.
He just told you about the cursed...

309
00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:19.930 line:80%
Explain police protocol to him.

310
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:20.805 line:80%
Let them do their job man.

311
00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:22.930 line:80%
Sir, what’s your division number?

312
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.680 line:80%
Why? What will you do?

313
00:16:26.305 --> 00:16:28.305 line:80%
Who do you think you are,
jerk?

314
00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:30.747 line:80%
Sir, don’t curse. are you mad?

315
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.474 line:80%
Go wait outside.

316
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.805 line:80%
Wait.

317
00:16:33.997 --> 00:16:36.555 line:80%
I’ll take him, Sir.
I’ll take him.

318
00:16:37.305 --> 00:16:39.083 line:80%
Come. Let's find the baby.

319
00:16:39.108 --> 00:16:42.333 line:80%
Apologize right away.

320
00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:44.108 line:80%
I apologize, Sir.
I am sorry.

321
00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:45.443 line:80%
He is a witness.

322
00:16:45.468 --> 00:16:46.968 line:80%
And he’s not going anywhere.

323
00:16:47.187 --> 00:16:48.687 line:80%
Sir please!

324
00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:50.195 line:80%
Say sorry.

325
00:16:50.555 --> 00:16:51.305 line:80%
Sure, Sir.

326
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.680 line:80%
Let's go.

327
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.055 line:80%
Sorry.

328
00:17:14.055 --> 00:17:15.555 line:80%
What happened to you in there?

329
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.432 line:80%
Is something wrong?

330
00:17:19.457 --> 00:17:22.582 line:80%
I just lost my cool.
They were so callous.

331
00:17:22.805 --> 00:17:24.680 line:80%
- I’m sorry.
- What is he saying?

332
00:17:25.805 --> 00:17:27.338 line:80%
We have to go with them.

333
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.424 line:80%
To the cursed manor.

334
00:17:28.449 --> 00:17:29.824 line:80%
Cursed place?

335
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.680 line:80%
We’re finding the baby now?

336
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.930 line:80%
- It’s only 15 mins.
- And if we don't find her?

337
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.555 line:80%
- We'll leave.
- We’ll keep searching?

338
00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.305 line:80%
- No no no. We’ll leave.
- Spend the whole day here?

339
00:17:37.305 --> 00:17:38.305 line:80%
No. It’s only 15 mins.

340
00:17:38.305 --> 00:17:39.680 line:80%
You wanna skip her wedding, right?

341
00:17:39.713 --> 00:17:41.680 line:80%
No way. I’ve got a gift for Mum.

342
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.555 line:80%
Brother, they wouldn’t
have helped her.

343
00:17:46.055 --> 00:17:49.805 line:80%
- She’ll die without her baby.
- Thanks to you, I’m also stuck.

344
00:17:50.305 --> 00:17:53.305 line:80%
I should be there man.
At least one son should be there.

345
00:17:55.555 --> 00:17:57.055 line:80%
We’ll go.

346
00:18:03.338 --> 00:18:07.805 line:80%
Let’s go now.
I’ll handle it later.

347
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.430 line:80%
Come on.

348
00:18:12.805 --> 00:18:13.430 line:80%
Raman.

349
00:18:13.555 --> 00:18:16.055 line:80%
- Gautam, we can’t leave bro.
- Just come with me.

350
00:18:16.055 --> 00:18:18.180 line:80%
He’s taken my ID card.

351
00:18:19.805 --> 00:18:20.930 line:80%
Why’d you give it?

352
00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:27.930 line:80%
I’m sorry.
I’ll apologise to them.

353
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.430 line:80%
We’re stuck man.
We’re stuck badly.

354
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.805 line:80%
Mark my words. We’re in deep shit.

355
00:18:37.695 --> 00:18:39.961 line:80%
What will I tell Mum?

356
00:18:47.656 --> 00:18:49.680 line:80%
Balwant will come grab the tea boy.

357
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.680 line:80%
Take him for a medical first.

358
00:18:53.305 --> 00:18:53.805 line:80%
You boys!

359
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.305 line:80%
Take her with you.

360
00:18:57.805 --> 00:19:00.305 line:80%
Welcome, madam.
At your service.

361
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.430 line:80%
Hurry up.

362
00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.180 line:80%
Shut the door harder.

363
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.180 line:80%
Stay on our tail.

364
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.180 line:80%
Sir, his ID?

365
00:19:36.646 --> 00:19:37.930 line:80%
What ID?

366
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.305 line:80%
Come on.

367
00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:26.357 line:80%
Where the hell
are they taking us?

368
00:20:27.805 --> 00:20:29.305 line:80%
It’s the opposite direction.

369
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.930 line:80%
Call your family to help.

370
00:20:41.055 --> 00:20:42.305 line:80%
We’ll leave after dropping you.

371
00:20:43.055 --> 00:20:44.805 line:80%
Champa is all I have.

372
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.930 line:80%
Champa is your daughter’s name?

373
00:20:48.555 --> 00:20:49.055 line:80%
Yes.

374
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680 line:80%
How old is she?

375
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.180 line:80%
Five months.

376
00:20:55.805 --> 00:20:56.680 line:80%
You’ll find her.

377
00:20:59.794 --> 00:21:02.180 line:80%
Don't give her false hopes.

378
00:21:05.805 --> 00:21:06.930 line:80%
You’re going home?

379
00:21:09.055 --> 00:21:10.305 line:80%
Manali.

380
00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:13.305 line:80%
Manali?
In peak winter.

381
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.180 line:80%
With a five month old baby?

382
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:16.180 line:80%
So?

383
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.805 line:80%
So, it's not safe.

384
00:21:19.555 --> 00:21:21.055 line:80%
That’s our life.

385
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.930 line:80%
We move for work.

386
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.680 line:80%
Building houses and roads.

387
00:21:29.555 --> 00:21:31.180 line:80%
No work in your village?

388
00:21:31.555 --> 00:21:32.430 line:80%
Left it.

389
00:21:32.805 --> 00:21:33.555 line:80%
Why?

390
00:21:37.305 --> 00:21:40.305 line:80%
Police filed a false case
against my husband.

391
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.055 line:80%
He died in prison.I ran away.

392
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.180 line:80%
What case?

393
00:22:13.952 --> 00:22:14.827 line:80%
Brother.

394
00:22:15.305 --> 00:22:16.430 line:80%
Should I drive?

395
00:22:20.805 --> 00:22:21.805 line:80%
Brother.

396
00:22:22.052 --> 00:22:23.596 line:80%
Brother.

397
00:22:23.872 --> 00:22:25.180 line:80%
Hold on.

398
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:26.851 line:80%
Pull over to the side.

399
00:22:26.876 --> 00:22:28.458 line:80%
- What happened?
- Pull over.

400
00:22:30.763 --> 00:22:32.930 line:80%
- Get down.
- I can drive.

401
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.805 line:80%
Yeah, sure.

402
00:22:34.922 --> 00:22:35.547 line:80%
Get down.

403
00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:38.555 line:80%
You're dozing off.

404
00:22:43.555 --> 00:22:45.055 line:80%
We lost them. Shit.

405
00:22:48.943 --> 00:22:51.805 line:80%
Why haven’t you spoken to Mum?

406
00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:55.305 line:80%
She was asking for
you the whole time.

407
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.930 line:80%
Brother, you were there with her.

408
00:22:59.805 --> 00:23:01.930 line:80%
But she was asking about you.

409
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.055 line:80%
She was missing you.

410
00:23:03.055 --> 00:23:04.555 line:80%
Stop guilt tripping me.

411
00:23:05.523 --> 00:23:07.273 line:80%
You know I missed my flight.

412
00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:09.173 line:80%
You should have taken
the next one.

413
00:23:09.198 --> 00:23:10.805 line:80%
It cost 21,000.

414
00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:13.805 line:80%
Stop worrying about money.

415
00:23:14.805 --> 00:23:16.055 line:80%
I was paying for it.

416
00:23:16.555 --> 00:23:18.055 line:80%
Why would you?

417
00:23:18.055 --> 00:23:19.305 line:80%
Why can’t I?

418
00:23:19.515 --> 00:23:20.765 line:80%
I earn enough.

419
00:23:20.906 --> 00:23:23.155 line:80%
You also... Leave it.

420
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.430 line:80%
Yeah. Leave it. Please.

421
00:23:24.555 --> 00:23:26.930 line:80%
Next flight was four hours later.

422
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.430 line:80%
Couldn’t have reached
before 01:30.

423
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.055 line:80%
And the train was
reaching at 02:00.

424
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.680 line:80%
But it didn't. You were late.

425
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.430 line:80%
And missed the party.

426
00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:37.055 line:80%
Jhumpa.

427
00:23:37.555 --> 00:23:39.680 line:80%
The police were at
your brother’s place.

428
00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:42.180 line:80%
He has told
them everything.

429
00:23:42.562 --> 00:23:47.055 line:80%
They know which train you took
and they have your photo.

430
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.305 line:80%
Watch your back, Jhumpa.

431
00:23:51.305 --> 00:23:53.430 line:80%
It's not my fault
the train ran late.

432
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.555 line:80%
Everyone knows that
trains run late.

433
00:23:55.555 --> 00:23:57.680 line:80%
Flights also run late
and get cancelled.

434
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.555 line:80%
And lightning can strike us too.

435
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.680 line:80%
I’m here for the wedding, right?

436
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.305 line:80%
Should I say thank you?

437
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.805 line:80%
No, gimme a medal.

438
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.555 line:80%
Now what,
man!

439
00:24:24.305 --> 00:24:25.555 line:80%
Who the hell
are these guys?

440
00:24:25.555 --> 00:24:26.555 line:80%
Who knows.

441
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.555 line:80%
What happened, Sir?

442
00:24:29.305 --> 00:24:30.305 line:80%
Where are you going?

443
00:24:30.305 --> 00:24:32.180 line:80%
We're with the police
who passed on a bike.

444
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.305 line:80%
Call them. I’ll confirm.

445
00:24:34.218 --> 00:24:34.718 line:80%
Do we have contact ?

446
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:35.930 line:80%
Where are you going?

447
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:37.914 line:80%
To Mandawa.

448
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:39.491 line:80%
In the opposite direction?

449
00:24:40.055 --> 00:24:42.055 line:80%
As I said, we’re
following the policemen.

450
00:24:42.055 --> 00:24:43.305 line:80%
Show me your ID.
Get out.

451
00:24:43.305 --> 00:24:44.805 line:80%
What's the problem, Sir?

452
00:24:44.805 --> 00:24:45.555 line:80%
Check the boot.

453
00:24:45.555 --> 00:24:46.680 line:80%
There’s a lady in the car.

454
00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.805 line:80%
Shut up and get out.

455
00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:49.180 line:80%
Get out, you two.
Get her out.

456
00:24:49.992 --> 00:24:51.680 line:80%
Watch the girl.

457
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.680 line:80%
This is the trio.

458
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.125 line:80%
What’s this behaviour?

459
00:24:55.547 --> 00:24:57.672 line:80%
Check the boot properly.

460
00:24:57.805 --> 00:24:59.055 line:80%
Do we look like criminals?

461
00:24:59.055 --> 00:25:00.680 line:80%
We’re going for important work.

462
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.680 line:80%
Here they are.

463
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.187 line:80%
What's the holdup?

464
00:25:03.212 --> 00:25:06.555 line:80%
Sir, I have information. 30 mins
ago, two men and a woman...

465
00:25:06.555 --> 00:25:09.555 line:80%
...stole a baby from Kumba railway station
and escaped in a Black SUV.

466
00:25:11.805 --> 00:25:12.805 line:80%
This is a bullshit video.

467
00:25:12.805 --> 00:25:14.555 line:80%
Everyone in a black car
is a kidnapper?

468
00:25:14.805 --> 00:25:19.180 line:80%
Be quiet. Stand back.
We’ll sort it out.

469
00:25:19.312 --> 00:25:22.180 line:80%
News of these 3 has gone viral.

470
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.805 line:80%
Our Youth Watch Group
is getting all the updates.

471
00:25:23.805 --> 00:25:24.930 line:80%
Check your source.

472
00:25:25.305 --> 00:25:26.555 line:80%
My source is reliable.

473
00:25:27.366 --> 00:25:29.366 line:80%
Forest officers are not police.

474
00:25:30.468 --> 00:25:32.593 line:80%
They’re with me.
How dare you stop them?

475
00:25:32.618 --> 00:25:33.493 line:80%
Our children are at risk.

476
00:25:34.055 --> 00:25:35.805 line:80%
We have to be vigilant.

477
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.055 line:80%
They’re suspects.

478
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.055 line:80%
They’re not suspects.

479
00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:41.038 line:80%
They’re witnesses.

480
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.805 line:80%
- Get into the car.
- Wait.

481
00:25:43.805 --> 00:25:45.180 line:80%
Put it in writing.

482
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:47.655 line:80%
Stay in your limits.

483
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.930 line:80%
- Talk to your boss.
- Don’t get in my way.

484
00:25:51.156 --> 00:25:52.531 line:80%
The clown wants it in writing!

485
00:25:53.041 --> 00:25:54.416 line:80%
Yes sir!

486
00:25:54.726 --> 00:25:56.017 line:80%
Sir I got an input.

487
00:25:56.042 --> 00:25:57.596 line:80%
Two men in a black car are...

488
00:25:58.505 --> 00:26:00.180 line:80%
But sir...

489
00:26:00.208 --> 00:26:01.930 line:80%
Get in the car.

490
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:04.991 line:80%
Come on. Get in the car!

491
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.430 line:80%
Do I look like a baby snatcher?

492
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.680 line:80%
It's okay. It's over.

Look at the way he was talking.

494
00:26:17.555 --> 00:26:21.180 line:80%
I told you she would
get us into trouble.

Let it go, brother.
It’s not her fault.

Wake up, dude.

If the police hadn’t come
we would've been screwed.

- Relaxed, brother.
- I am relaxed, okay?

504
00:26:44.805 --> 00:26:45.930 line:80%
Aren't the police doing their job?

505
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.680 line:80%
Only because we are here.

506

If this is how you manage my event,
no wonder clients keep complaining.

518

Why did you attack her?

Why?

We might find a clue.

Listen to me. She’s being framed.

659
00:40:56.812 --> 00:40:59.055 line:80%
You’re helping a criminal.

660
00:40:59.055 --> 00:41:00.680 line:80%
- She’s not a criminal.
- She’s a thief.

661
00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.180 line:80%
- She’s not.
- I’m not a thief.

662
00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.930 line:80%
Her contractor filed
a fake complaint.

663
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:04.930 line:80%
You know how it works.

664
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:06.680 line:80%
Really?
Let’s call the police then.

665
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.680 line:80%
- Are you mad?
- Why? You scared?

666
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.359 line:80%
Police will arrest her.
The baby won't be found.

667
00:41:10.384 --> 00:41:11.384 line:80%
And what’s your plan?

668
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.555 line:80%
I’ll explain.

669
00:41:13.555 --> 00:41:15.055 line:80%
She found this card at the hideout.

670
00:41:15.055 --> 00:41:19.055 line:80%
This Acchelal has her baby.

671
00:41:19.055 --> 00:41:21.305 line:80%
He was at this rehab
center three days ago.

672
00:41:21.305 --> 00:41:22.430 line:80%
- Where did you find this?
- Inside.

673
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.430 line:80%
You’re going to jail.

674
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:26.055 line:80%
You stole evidence!

675
00:41:26.055 --> 00:41:28.180 line:80%
Police won’t do anything with it.

676
00:41:28.305 --> 00:41:31.680 line:80%
Please spare us, woman!
I’m a killer already!

677
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.055 line:80%
I’ll find my baby myself!

678
00:41:33.055 --> 00:41:34.180 line:80%
Get lost!

679
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.180 line:80%
- Have you lost it?
- What’s gotten into you?

680
00:41:37.805 --> 00:41:38.805 line:80%
What are you doing?

681
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.705 line:80%
Can't you see that
she needs our help?

682
00:41:41.245 --> 00:41:42.805 line:80%
Why do you have to help?

683
00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.570 line:80%
Someone has to.

684
00:41:45.562 --> 00:41:47.062 line:80%
Raman. Be practical.

685
00:41:47.328 --> 00:41:49.453 line:80%
I'm not practical like you.

686
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.295 line:80%
Sometimes one has
to take a stand.

687
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.070 line:80%
What else have we been doing?

688
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.805 line:80%
You'll never get it.

689
00:42:02.378 --> 00:42:03.805 line:80%
Make me get it.

690
00:42:03.805 --> 00:42:05.930 line:80%
You won’t.
You’ve never lost a loved one.

691
00:42:09.805 --> 00:42:11.680 line:80%
Raman, wait a minute.

692
00:42:13.132 --> 00:42:14.632 line:80%
Are you blaming me for your loss?

693
00:42:18.055 --> 00:42:19.305 line:80%
She was terminal.

694
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.500 line:80%
We also loved Riya.

695
00:42:23.138 --> 00:42:24.930 line:80%
We took her to Hopkins.

696
00:42:26.914 --> 00:42:27.789 line:80%
We tried.

697
00:42:29.312 --> 00:42:29.937 line:80%
Tried what?

698
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.030 line:80%
What did you do?

699
00:42:31.429 --> 00:42:31.929 line:80%
What?

700
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:32.945 line:80%
What did you do?

701
00:42:34.179 --> 00:42:35.429 line:80%
We did everything.

702
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:36.680 line:80%
Tell me one thing.

703
00:42:36.805 --> 00:42:38.055 line:80%
I gave you everything.

704
00:42:38.483 --> 00:42:41.608 line:80%
I just wanted a hand on my shoulder.
And what did you do?

705
00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:43.851 line:80%
Remember what you said?

706
00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:45.000 line:80%
Move on.

707
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:47.195 line:80%
For your own good.

708
00:42:48.984 --> 00:42:50.734 line:80%
Please try to understand.

709
00:42:51.172 --> 00:42:53.297 line:80%
I’m your brother.
Not an assignment.

710
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.430 line:80%
Take my advice.

711
00:42:58.195 --> 00:43:00.695 line:80%
Think beyond money.
That might help.

712
00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.055 line:80%
The rehab centre is
in Bansdola village.

713
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.805 line:80%
It's only 15 mins away. But
I can't find it on the GPS.

714
00:45:04.055 --> 00:45:06.680 line:80%
Pull over, I'll ask for directions.

715
00:45:08.805 --> 00:45:10.055 line:80%
Right here.

716
00:45:18.055 --> 00:45:19.180 line:80%
I'll be right there.

717
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.055 line:80%
I'm really sorry.

718
00:46:10.805 --> 00:46:13.305 line:80%
Boys, it’s the SUV
from this video.

719
00:46:13.305 --> 00:46:16.305 line:80%
Yes. It's the kidnappers.

720
00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.430 line:80%
Bablu, livestream this.

721
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:30.930 line:80%
Oi. Hello.

722
00:46:32.841 --> 00:46:34.765 line:80%
What's going on?

723
00:46:34.805 --> 00:46:36.055 line:80%
Want a ride?

724
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.555 line:80%
You’ve sold the baby?

725
00:46:37.555 --> 00:46:38.680 line:80%
What baby?

726
00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.155 line:80%
Come here.

727
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.680 line:80%
Don’t act innocent.

728
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.555 line:80%
We’ll find them now
that we have you.

729
00:46:43.555 --> 00:46:44.805 line:80%
Stop recording!

730
00:46:44.846 --> 00:46:45.805 line:80%
Put it down.

731
00:46:45.805 --> 00:46:47.680 line:80%
- You were at the station?
- So?

732
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.641 line:80%
- Where are our children?
- What children?

733
00:46:49.666 --> 00:46:51.291 line:80%
Billay! Mukesh!

734
00:46:51.316 --> 00:46:53.430 line:80%
One minute. Just hear me out.

735
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.805 line:80%
- Raman!
- It’s his partner.

736
00:46:55.805 --> 00:46:58.430 line:80%
Don't raise your voice.

737
00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.805 line:80%
Keep your gaze down.

738
00:47:00.805 --> 00:47:03.555 line:80%
Wait. What has happened?

739
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.430 line:80%
Stop fighting.

740
00:47:07.455 --> 00:47:09.555 line:80%
Calm down please.

741
00:47:10.221 --> 00:47:12.430 line:80%
Bilay, get the girl.

742
00:47:12.768 --> 00:47:14.930 line:80%
It's a misunderstanding.
Hear me out.

743
00:47:19.055 --> 00:47:19.930 line:80%
Hey!

744
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.180 line:80%
What are you doing?

745
00:47:21.461 --> 00:47:23.555 line:80%
How dare you touch me?

746
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.305 line:80%
I'll break you!
You're dead.

747
00:47:28.055 --> 00:47:29.680 line:80%
Get in the car.

748
00:47:37.406 --> 00:47:38.930 line:80%
Get in the car.

749
00:47:46.805 --> 00:47:47.930 line:80%
Hurry!

750
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.180 line:80%
- Why do you keep fighting?
- What did I do?

751
00:48:01.305 --> 00:48:03.930 line:80%
Get her. Please.

752
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:04.680 line:80%
Yeah, okay.

753
00:48:05.055 --> 00:48:06.180 line:80%
They'll kill her.

754
00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.680 line:80%
Hurry up.

755
00:48:20.055 --> 00:48:21.180 line:80%
Speed up.

756
00:48:25.805 --> 00:48:26.430 line:80%
Which way?

757
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:27.680 line:80%
There.

758
00:48:43.055 --> 00:48:44.430 line:80%
So much cash?

759
00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.055 line:80%
I earned it.

760
00:48:49.055 --> 00:48:50.555 line:80%
As a laborer?

761
00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:52.055 line:80%
No. I saved up.

762
00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:54.805 line:80%
Your contractor didn’t pay you
and filed a fake complaint.

763
00:48:54.805 --> 00:48:56.055 line:80%
I worked for a year.

764
00:48:56.055 --> 00:48:57.180 line:80%
And earned so much?

765
00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.305 line:80%
After the construction job,
I worked for a year.

766
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.180 line:80%
She’s lying, bro!
Don’t believe her.

767
00:49:07.305 --> 00:49:08.680 line:80%
How did you reach Bombay?

768
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.805 line:80%
You said you've never been there.

769
00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.930 line:80%
Tell us the truth.

770
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.180 line:80%
Did you steal the money?

771
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.680 line:80%
They are after us. Floor it.

772
00:49:29.971 --> 00:49:31.471 line:80%
Raman. Call Panditji.

773
00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:34.874 line:80%
Password?

774
00:49:36.578 --> 00:49:37.805 line:80%
1-9-8-2

775
00:49:40.961 --> 00:49:42.221 line:80%
are they still coming?

776
00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:43.596 line:80%
Yes, run it fast.

777
00:49:46.805 --> 00:49:47.805 line:80%
Yeah?

778
00:49:47.805 --> 00:49:50.555 line:80%
Sir, some men are after us.

779
00:49:50.555 --> 00:49:51.305 line:80%
What!

780
00:49:51.305 --> 00:49:53.305 line:80%
They're chasing us on bikes.

781
00:50:03.055 --> 00:50:04.555 line:80%
Where are you right now?

782
00:50:04.555 --> 00:50:08.805 line:80%
It's a hilly road.
With grey boulders.

783
00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:12.305 line:80%
The road leads to Bansdola village.
Don't stop anywhere else.

784
00:50:12.305 --> 00:50:13.055 line:80%
I'm coming.

785
00:50:13.055 --> 00:50:14.055 line:80%
Hurry up please, sir.

786
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.930 line:80%
Are they still behind us?

787
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:28.680 line:80%
Yes!

788
00:50:35.805 --> 00:50:37.055 line:80%
Stop the car.

789
00:50:41.055 --> 00:50:41.930 line:80%
Open the door.

790
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:42.680 line:80%
Stop the car.

791
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.930 line:80%
Stop chasing us, jerks.

792
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:48.805 line:80%
Watch out, bro!

793
00:51:06.737 --> 00:51:07.930 line:80%
Give me my phone.

794
00:51:12.435 --> 00:51:14.680 line:80%
Jhumpa, where the hell are you?

795
00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.555 line:80%
Don't say anything, brother.

796
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.305 line:80%
- I'm warning you.
- The cops are after me, idiot.

797
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.805 line:80%
Are you insane,
stealing madam's baby?

798
00:51:24.305 --> 00:51:25.513 line:80%
It's not her baby.

799
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.305 line:80%
You've really screwed up.

800
00:51:27.625 --> 00:51:29.805 line:80%
Whose child has she stolen?

801
00:51:29.805 --> 00:51:30.680 line:80%
Who's speaking?

802
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.805 line:80%
Where are you taking Jhumpa?

803
00:51:32.805 --> 00:51:34.305 line:80%
Jhumpa is with us.
Where are you calling from?

804
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:35.805 line:80%
Damn.

805
00:51:36.391 --> 00:51:38.430 line:80%
She's stolen the baby.

806
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:39.305 line:80%
No.

807
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:41.930 line:80%
It's not hers.
She's been deceiving us.

808
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:43.281 line:80%
No.

809
00:51:43.805 --> 00:51:45.930 line:80%
My brother is a dishonest jerk.

810
00:51:45.955 --> 00:51:48.930 line:80%
Everyone's a jerk.
And you're a saint.

811
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.430 line:80%
You will rot in jail, Jhumpa.

812
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:54.180 line:80%
I'm a fool to have trusted you.

813
00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.805 line:80%
I fought my brother
and the police for you.

814
00:51:56.805 --> 00:51:58.680 line:80%
Trust me. My brother is evil.

815
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.055 line:80%
They think we stole the baby.

816
00:52:00.055 --> 00:52:02.680 line:80%
- He sold Champa to my employer.
- She's making up stories.

817
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:06.305 line:80%
You tricked us.
Despite us helping you.

818
00:52:06.305 --> 00:52:08.680 line:80%
- Believe me, Sir.
- Whose daughter is Champa?

819
00:52:09.958 --> 00:52:10.930 line:80%
My daughter.

820
00:52:12.661 --> 00:52:14.180 line:80%
Don't freaking lie.

821
00:52:14.205 --> 00:52:15.430 line:80%
Damn, there’s more.

822
00:54:03.135 --> 00:54:06.159 line:80%
Just breathe, okay?
I’ll look at it once.

823
00:54:06.184 --> 00:54:07.684 line:80%
Don’t touch my brother.

824

00:54:14.733 --> 00:54:15.733 line:80%
You used us.

826
00:54:17.555 --> 00:54:19.180 line:80%
You stole the baby
and my brother...

827
00:54:23.555 --> 00:54:26.305 line:80%
You still think I'm lying?

828
00:54:29.305 --> 00:54:32.430 line:80%
I stole the baby?
Lied to you?

829
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:38.906 line:80%
Champa is my daughter.

830
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:49.831 line:80%
Keep the pressure.

831
00:54:57.805 --> 00:54:59.805 line:80%
I'll just call for some help.

832
00:54:59.805 --> 00:55:02.055 line:80%
Yeah, please. Hospital.

Please don’t do this.
We’ve done nothing.

840
00:55:36.768 --> 00:55:38.805 line:80%
Throw it away.
You’ll hurt yourself.

841
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.930 line:80%
Give me the keys.
Give me the damn keys.

842
00:55:45.955 --> 00:55:47.930 line:80%
Throw the keys, jerk.

843
00:55:52.995 --> 00:55:54.055 line:80%
You get in car.

844
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:02.930 line:80%
Raman, get in the car.

845
00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:10.940 line:80%

Shit man!

No network.

853
00:56:44.976 --> 00:56:46.195 line:80%
Water...

854
00:56:46.555 --> 00:56:48.430 line:80%
Some water, please.

855
00:56:49.656 --> 00:56:52.555 line:80%
- Do we have water?

She...

897
01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.805 line:80%

You’re not getting away.

924
01:07:06.169 --> 01:07:08.430 line:80%
Stop right there, you damn thief.

925
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:11.180 line:80%
You'll pay for every stolen baby.

926
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:14.180 line:80%

934
01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.180 line:80%
Where is the baby?

Believe me...
I don’t...

936
01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.305 line:80%
He won’t tell us this easily.

937
01:08:01.305 --> 01:08:03.430 line:80%
Baby snatchers are real scum.

938
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:06.030 line:80%
We’ll make an example of you.

939

945
01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.560 line:80%
Come on, everybody.

946
01:08:53.055 --> 01:08:55.654 line:80%
This piece of shit stole
our children.

947
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:07.055 line:80%
Hit him hard.
Beat him.

948
01:09:08.555 --> 01:09:11.430 line:80%
Everyone come to the square.

949
01:09:35.818 --> 01:09:39.805 line:80%
Hey. Back off.
Leave him.

01:09:39.805 --> 01:09:42.055 line:80%
He hasn’t done anything.
Are you crazy?

951
01:09:42.055 --> 01:09:45.430 line:80%
Stay away, Panditji.
I’m asking politely.

952
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.805 line:80%
I’m warning you, Rana.

953
01:09:58.802 --> 01:10:02.930 line:80%
Have you guys gone insane?

954
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:04.680 line:80%
You will kill him!

955
01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.055 line:80%
He deserves to be killed.

956
01:10:07.055 --> 01:10:09.180 line:80%
He has not stolen any baby.

957
01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:39.930 line:80%
Get off him!

958
01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:41.430 line:80%
Stay away, Panditji.

959
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:43.555 line:80%
Stop this madness!

960
01:10:44.026 --> 01:10:47.305 line:80%
Rana, don't dig your own grave.

961
01:10:47.305 --> 01:10:49.055 line:80%
You'll regret it.

962
01:10:49.055 --> 01:10:50.805 line:80%
He has not stolen any baby.

963
01:10:50.805 --> 01:10:54.055 line:80%
Stop behaving like animals.

964
01:11:05.055 --> 01:11:07.805 line:80%
Get away, you animals!

965
01:11:10.305 --> 01:11:11.805 line:80%
Let’s go, Mr. Bansal.

966
01:11:20.255 --> 01:11:22.430 line:80%
Why are you beating him?

967
01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.180 line:80%
Mr. Bansal?
Where’s your brother?

968
01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:35.180 line:80%

Where's Acchelal?

972
01:13:21.055 --> 01:13:24.180 line:80%
You sure you left him here?

973
01:13:25.366 --> 01:13:27.366 line:80%
I’ll check upstairs.

974
01:13:33.805 --> 01:13:35.555 line:80%
Mr. Bansal, there's no one there.

975
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.055 line:80%
Be careful, Mr. Bansal

976
01:13:44.331 --> 01:13:47.729 line:80%
Mr. Bansal, please slow down.

977
01:13:48.612 --> 01:13:50.112 line:80%
Easy please.

978
01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:54.704 line:80%
Have you seen any injured man?

979
01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:56.768 line:80%
No one...

980
01:14:01.658 --> 01:14:03.033 line:80%
Did you see anyone?

981
01:14:03.471 --> 01:14:06.016 line:80%
No. I came just now.

982
01:14:07.812 --> 01:14:12.663 line:80%
Someone must've seen him.
He was right here.

983
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:19.305 line:80%
Have you seen any injured person?

984
01:14:19.305 --> 01:14:21.680 line:80%
No, Sir. I haven't.

985
01:14:27.945 --> 01:14:29.805 line:80%
His brother is badly hurt.

986
01:14:29.805 --> 01:14:32.430 line:80%
Please help us. Don't be afraid.

987

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.461 line:80%
Panditji?

989
01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:42.430 line:80%
Sir, we found a dead body.

990
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:44.555 line:80%
It’s brutally hacked with an axe.

991
01:14:45.359 --> 01:14:47.734 line:80%
Whose body? Found any ID?

992
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:49.805 line:80%
Didn’t find any ID.

993
01:14:51.055 --> 01:14:52.430 line:80%
Investigate further.

994
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:53.555 line:80%
Yes, Sir.

995
01:15:24.555 --> 01:15:25.555 line:80%
Where's Acchelal?

996
01:15:25.633 --> 01:15:27.055 line:80%
Hey! Stop!

997
01:15:27.164 --> 01:15:28.305 line:80%
Where is he?

998
01:15:28.305 --> 01:15:29.430 line:80%
Why would he be here?

999
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:30.280 line:80%
Tell me.

1000
01:15:30.305 --> 01:15:31.780 line:80%
He was here three days ago.

1001
01:15:31.805 --> 01:15:34.030 line:80%
Stand back. Let me talk to her.

1002
01:15:34.055 --> 01:15:35.180 line:80%
Listen... what's your name?

1003
01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:36.805 line:80%
Tell me the truth!
Where's he hiding?

1004
01:15:36.805 --> 01:15:37.680 line:80%
Hemraj, get out.

1005
01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:40.680 line:80%
Listen. Calm down.
Let's talk.

1006
01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.555 line:80%
Watch it.
You'll hurt yourself.

1007
01:15:44.305 --> 01:15:46.805 line:80%
Tell me... where are you from?

1008
01:15:47.805 --> 01:15:48.930 line:80%
Have a seat.

1009
01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:49.805 line:80%
Where's Acchelal?

1010
01:15:49.805 --> 01:15:51.338 line:80%
He's not here.

1011
01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.430 line:80%
What has he done?

1012
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:54.930 line:80%
He's stolen my baby!

1013
01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.430 line:80%
He stole my Champa.

1014
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:05.430 line:80%
I'll help you.

1015
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:40.680 line:80%
- Panditji, has the ambulance reached?
- Yes, Sir.

1016
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680 line:80%
And Raman?

1017
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.805 line:80%
He’s alive but
can’t say for how long.

1018
01:16:44.805 --> 01:16:46.430 line:80%
What did Gautam say?

1019
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:49.430 line:80%
Sir, he’s seen the scar.
Jhumpa has delivered the baby.

1020
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:52.930 line:80%
It's clear. She sold her womb.

1021
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:55.180 line:80%
Yes, Sir. It's a tricky case.

1022
01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.055 line:80%
Did you call that number?

1023
01:16:57.055 --> 01:16:57.825 line:80%
Yes, Sir.

1024
01:16:57.850 --> 01:16:59.475 line:80%
I called Daya madam.

1025
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:03.180 line:80%
When she learnt I'm a cop,
she denied the story...

1026
01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:04.805 line:80%
...and hung up the phone.

1027
01:17:05.241 --> 01:17:08.491 line:80%
Of course she did.
It's an illegal surrogacy.

1028
01:17:08.516 --> 01:17:11.535 line:80%
Daya madam and Jhumpa,
will both go to jail.

1029
01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.805 line:80%
- Yes, Sir.
- And the baby will suffer.

1030
01:17:13.805 --> 01:17:15.555 line:80%
If she's found.

1031
01:17:15.555 --> 01:17:16.305 line:80%
Yes, Sir.

1032
01:17:16.305 --> 01:17:17.680 line:80%
You okay?

1033
01:17:19.055 --> 01:17:20.555 line:80%
- Let’s leave?
- Yeah.

1034
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:28.055 line:80%
Panditji, go find Jhumpa.

1035
01:17:28.055 --> 01:17:30.430 line:80%
Sir, me...

1036
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:33.680 line:80%
Is your head still spinning... huh?

1037
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.354 line:80%
I didn’t mean that, sir.

1038
01:17:35.379 --> 01:17:38.555 line:80%
I was taking the boys
to the hospital.

1039
01:17:40.054 --> 01:17:41.429 line:80%
The ambulance is enough.

1040
01:17:41.625 --> 01:17:44.125 line:80%
If she gets away
there will be an enquiry.

1041
01:17:44.288 --> 01:17:48.163 line:80%
Mumbai Police are coming.
Get her to the headquarters.

1042
01:17:49.055 --> 01:17:50.055 line:80%
As you say.

1043
01:17:56.055 --> 01:17:57.805 line:80%
You go ahead.

1044
01:17:58.055 --> 01:18:00.305 line:80%
What about the baby?

1045
01:18:00.805 --> 01:18:02.930 line:80%
No one cares about her.

1046
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:06.805 line:80%
He’s lost a lot of blood.
You should leave urgently.

1047
01:18:06.805 --> 01:18:11.055 line:80%
Jhumpa is innocent.
She’s being framed.

1048
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:15.055 line:80%
We will investigate.
Don’t worry.

1049
01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:19.555 line:80%
Leave immediately.
Don’t waste time.

1050
01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.430 line:80%
Sir, please pass my phone.

1051
01:18:49.305 --> 01:18:50.930 line:80%
Yeah. What happened?

1052
01:18:53.805 --> 01:18:55.680 line:80%
I’m driving, idiot.

1053
01:19:02.055 --> 01:19:04.180 line:80%
How could I say no to the police?

1054
01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.680 line:80%
That’s Acchelal standing beside Surili.

1055
01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.055 line:80%
Local wrestling champ.

1056
01:19:09.305 --> 01:19:13.305 line:80%
They met here.
He got her a job at the hospital.

1057
01:19:17.555 --> 01:19:19.430 line:80%
Is the paperwork done?

1058
01:19:21.555 --> 01:19:27.305 line:80%
Keep everything ready.
And don’t call again!

1059
01:19:49.305 --> 01:19:51.180 line:80%
Where can I find Acchelal?

1060
01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.680 line:80%
He drives the hospital ambulance.

1061
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:55.680 line:80%
Take me there.

1062
01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:57.430 line:80%
Let's go.

1063
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:58.805 line:80%
You're not going to any hospital.

1064
01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:02.555 line:80%
You're going to jail.

1065
01:20:07.305 --> 01:20:08.680 line:80%
Noor, wait outside.

1066
01:20:09.635 --> 01:20:11.930 line:80%
Nurse, prep for intubation.

1067
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:16.526 line:80%
Acchelal, clear the pockets.

1068
01:20:24.305 --> 01:20:25.680 line:80%
Pass the oximeter.

1069
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:40.430 line:80%
Doc, I'll be right back.

1070
01:20:40.805 --> 01:20:42.180 line:80%
Wait. We have to shift him.

1071
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:43.555 line:80%
I've got other work.

1072
01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:45.305 line:80%
Noor.

1073
01:20:47.055 --> 01:20:47.805 line:80%
Dharmender.

1074
01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.055 line:80%
Look here.

1075
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.930 line:80%
Shift him immediately.

1076
01:20:53.305 --> 01:20:56.135 line:80%
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

1077
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.737 line:80%
Excuse me.

1078
01:21:21.055 --> 01:21:22.305 line:80%
Do you have Panditji's number?

1079
01:21:22.305 --> 01:21:23.305 line:80%
Huh?

1080
01:21:23.305 --> 01:21:25.180 line:80%
The local cop with...
Shakti... Shakti Singh.

1081
01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.180 line:80%
Who is Shakti?

1082
01:21:29.055 --> 01:21:30.680 line:80%
Where can I find Acchelal?

1083
01:21:32.049 --> 01:21:33.680 line:80%
Who is accompanying you?

1084
01:21:34.305 --> 01:21:36.180 line:80%
- Where can I find him?
- Please wait here.

1085
01:21:36.805 --> 01:21:37.680 line:80%
You're badly hurt.

1086
01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.280 line:80%
Where are you going?

1087
01:21:41.305 --> 01:21:42.430 line:80%
Sir, please wait.

1088
01:22:12.055 --> 01:22:13.680 line:80%
Why haven't you finished it?

1089
01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.180 line:80%
Forget the name.
Let them write what they want.

1090
01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:23.430 line:80%
Just print the papers quickly.

1091
01:22:24.805 --> 01:22:26.555 line:80%
- Pass the certificate.
- Which one?

1092
01:22:26.555 --> 01:22:28.680 line:80%
Birth certificate, you fool!

1093
01:22:37.055 --> 01:22:38.805 line:80%
Excuse me.

1094
01:22:39.305 --> 01:22:41.055 line:80%
Who’s the head incharge here?

1095
01:22:41.055 --> 01:22:43.555 line:80%
- Head incharge?
- Main doctor?

1096
01:22:43.555 --> 01:22:46.055 line:80%
Dr. Dhingra.

1097
01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.555 line:80%
- Where to find him?
- Three rooms down.

1098
01:22:49.055 --> 01:22:52.271 line:80%
Wait. Listen to me.

1099
01:22:52.555 --> 01:22:56.055 line:80%
Where are you going?
You are badly hurt.

1100
01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.805 line:80%
Listen to me.

1101
01:22:58.805 --> 01:23:01.180 line:80%
You can’t go in like that.

1102
01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:04.055 line:80%
- Where’s the doctor?
- Let us treat you first.

1103
01:23:04.055 --> 01:23:05.805 line:80%
Please. It’s important.
I must see him.

1104
01:23:05.805 --> 01:23:08.305 line:80%
He is outside.

1105
01:23:08.661 --> 01:23:12.544 line:80%
Acchelal, quickly give
them the papers.

1106
01:23:12.569 --> 01:23:14.930 line:80%
You’re bleeding. Let me help you.

1107
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:18.055 line:80%
Please wait.
You’ll hurt yourself.

1108
01:23:18.055 --> 01:23:21.180 line:80%
You’re bleeding.
Please come with me.

1109
01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:23.305 line:80%
Sir, he’s not listening and...

1110
01:23:23.305 --> 01:23:25.280 line:80%
Whose child is that?

1111
01:23:25.305 --> 01:23:27.655 line:80%
Whose child is that?

1112
01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.305 line:80%
Whose is it?

1113
01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:32.305 line:80%
That child is not yours.

1114
01:23:32.305 --> 01:23:34.180 line:80%
Get him inside.
Patch him up.

1115
01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.922 line:80%
It's a stolen baby.
It's not yours.

1116
01:23:38.992 --> 01:23:40.680 line:80%
The baby is stolen Ma'am.

1117
01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.805 line:80%
Don’t do this.
You’ll never be happy.

1118
01:23:43.805 --> 01:23:45.795 line:80%
Please don't do this.

1119
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.443 line:80%
It’s someone else’s baby.

1120
01:23:47.468 --> 01:23:48.967 line:80%
Sir, he’s not listening

1121
01:23:48.992 --> 01:23:50.492 line:80%
Aye. Shut up!

1122
01:23:51.658 --> 01:23:52.908 line:80%
What's this nonsense?

1123
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:55.805 line:80%
Stop creating a ruckus.

1124
01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:57.305 line:80%
I'm creating a ruckus?

1125
01:23:57.305 --> 01:23:58.305 line:80%
Don't spread lies!

1126
01:23:58.305 --> 01:23:59.180 line:80%
I'm lying?

1127
01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.055 line:80%
Look at this.

1128
01:24:00.055 --> 01:24:01.180 line:80%
Isn't this the same baby?

1129
01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.430 line:80%
It's the same baby.

1130
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:04.655 line:80%
Put that away.

1131
01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.305 line:80%
They’re running a racket.

1132
01:24:06.305 --> 01:24:07.555 line:80%
Show me the baby's face.

1133
01:24:07.555 --> 01:24:08.690 line:80%
Why should we?

1134
01:24:08.715 --> 01:24:09.805 line:80%
Show me.

1135
01:24:09.805 --> 01:24:11.030 line:80%
We won't.

1136
01:24:11.055 --> 01:24:12.180 line:80%
Sir, show him the baby once.

1137
01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.680 line:80%
Shut up!
Just do your job.

1138
01:24:13.705 --> 01:24:16.055 line:80%
Show me the baby's face.
I dare you.

1139
01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.305 line:80%
- Come with us.
- No, I won't go.

1140
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:20.325 line:80%
Hey! Stop manhandling him.

1141
01:24:20.544 --> 01:24:21.680 line:80%
Get lost.

1142
01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:22.805 line:80%
Can't you see he's hurt?

1143
01:24:22.805 --> 01:24:24.430 line:80%
Don't interfere, madam.

1144
01:24:24.455 --> 01:24:26.180 line:80%
They are stealing babies.

1145
01:24:26.904 --> 01:24:28.555 line:80%
I have evidence.

1146
01:24:29.443 --> 01:24:31.555 line:80%
They're stealing babies.

1147
01:24:31.555 --> 01:24:32.805 line:80%
Show us the baby's face.

1148
01:24:32.805 --> 01:24:34.388 line:80%
Why should we show you anything?

1149
01:24:40.555 --> 01:24:42.805 line:80%
Why did you run
after taking the money?

1150
01:24:44.555 --> 01:24:48.180 line:80%
The payment was for one
child, which is with them.

1151
01:24:48.396 --> 01:24:50.430 line:80%
Don't spin yarns.

1152
01:24:51.305 --> 01:24:53.305 line:80%
I'm talking about the same child.

1153
01:24:53.305 --> 01:24:54.180 line:80%
No.

1154
01:24:56.055 --> 01:24:57.180 line:80%
The other child.

1155
01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.055 line:80%
Not my Champa.

1156
01:24:59.992 --> 01:25:02.555 line:80%
Deal was for one child, Sir.

1157
01:25:02.805 --> 01:25:03.930 line:80%
What was the deal?

1158
01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:08.930 line:80%
What was the deal?

1159
01:25:12.305 --> 01:25:15.680 line:80%
Daya madam doesn't
have her own child.

1160
01:25:17.055 --> 01:25:18.680 line:80%
So she bought my womb.

1161
01:25:19.529 --> 01:25:23.555 line:80%
Doctor told me that I would
have to carry one baby.

1162
01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:27.680 line:80%
But my goddess,
Bonbibi had a different plan.

1163
01:25:28.055 --> 01:25:29.680 line:80%
She knew I didn't have anyone.

1164
01:25:30.523 --> 01:25:33.055 line:80%
She knows my life.

1165
01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:45.805 line:80%
Without a man, Bonbibi
rewarded me with two babies.

1166
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.180 line:80%
The first child is with them.

1167
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:50.430 line:80%
Second one is my Champa.

1168
01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.305 line:80%
My daughter.

1169
01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.055 line:80%
Why should I give Champa?

1170
01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:01.180 line:80%
She is my daughter, right?

1171
01:26:19.154 --> 01:26:23.680 line:80%
They're running a rotten business.

1172
01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.055 line:80%
They are selling babies.

1173
01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:26.305 line:80%
The baby is stolen.

1174
01:26:26.305 --> 01:26:29.104 line:80%
Show us the baby.

1175
01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.667 line:80%
Yes, show us the baby.

1176
01:26:36.323 --> 01:26:38.555 line:80%
Show us the baby.

1177
01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:45.055 line:80%
Catch them.

1178
01:26:46.596 --> 01:26:48.805 line:80%
Catch the doctor.

1179
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:51.305 line:80%
Panditji.

1180
01:26:51.305 --> 01:26:53.794 line:80%
That's the kidnapper.

1181
01:26:53.819 --> 01:26:55.385 line:80%
The baby is inside.

1182
01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:58.180 line:80%
It’s their child.
We have the paperwork.

1183
01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.930 line:80%
All forged.

1184
01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:01.305 line:80%
Shut it!

1185
01:27:01.695 --> 01:27:02.945 line:80%
Let me investigate.

1186
01:27:03.612 --> 01:27:04.805 line:80%
Get out.

1187
01:27:04.805 --> 01:27:06.414 line:80%
We were told that the
baby is a COVID orphan.

1188
01:27:06.439 --> 01:27:07.689 line:80%
I paid 200,000.

1189
01:27:07.714 --> 01:27:10.430 line:80%
We’ll discuss your
200,000 in the prison.

1190
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:14.380 line:80%
Get out.

1191
01:27:14.677 --> 01:27:15.453 line:80%
Champa.

1192
01:27:16.545 --> 01:27:17.253 line:80%
Champa.

1193
01:27:19.039 --> 01:27:19.680 line:80%
Champa.

1194
01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:20.805 line:80%
Open the door.

1195
01:27:21.997 --> 01:27:23.263 line:80%
She’s my Champa.

1196
01:27:25.458 --> 01:27:26.724 line:80%
She’s my Champa.
