00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.834 line:82%
When does it expire?

159
00:09:45.166 --> 00:09:47.133 line:82%
It's a forever deal.

160
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.900 line:82%
-Are you happy to hear it again?
-Yes.

161
00:09:48.967 --> 00:09:50.000 line:82%
A commercial for 018.

162
00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:51.567 line:82%
-It's still the case today--
-Hey!

163
00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.734 line:82%
-Gosh.
-What was that?

164
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.400 line:82%
You sons of bitches!

165
00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:55.333 line:82%
-What?
-What?

166
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.000 line:82%
Hey! You sons of bitches!

167
00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.333 line:82%
-What?
-What?

168
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.767 line:82%
-All of you should be ruined!
-What?

169
00:10:06.834 --> 00:10:10.100 line:82%
You guys are absolutely crazy!

170
00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:11.667 line:82%
What?

171
00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:12.867 line:82%
-What's going on?
-What?

172
00:10:12.934 --> 00:10:13.767 line:82%
We should do drugs?

173
00:10:13.834 --> 00:10:15.166 line:82%
-What?
-Gosh!

174
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.667 line:82%
-What?
-What?

175
00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.000 line:82%
-What?
-It's money.

176
00:10:39.934 --> 00:10:40.834 line:82%
It's money.

177
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.200 line:82%
-Gosh.
-It's money.

178
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.233 line:82%
It's money.

179
00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:45.900 line:82%
It's money!

180
00:10:45.967 --> 00:10:46.967 line:82%
This is incredible.

181
00:10:49.633 --> 00:10:51.400 line:82%
-It's raining money.
-What?

182
00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:54.867 line:82%
-My goodness.
-What's this?

183
00:10:56.967 --> 00:10:58.767 line:82%
-What's wrong with you?
-Who is he?

184
00:10:58.834 --> 00:11:00.967 line:82%
All of you will be ruined.

185
00:11:01.533 --> 00:11:02.567 line:82%
-What?
-What was that?

186
00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:04.400 line:82%
-What?
-Who are you punks?

187
00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:08.333 line:82%
Gosh, he's at it again.

188
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.333 line:82%
-We haven't had peace since he came.
-Really?

189
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.934 line:82%
He ruined the atmosphere of the apartment.

190
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.767 line:82%
Is it unit 613 again?

191
00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:18.166 line:82%
He's a druggie. For goodness' sake.

192
00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:19.967 line:82%
He does drugs?

193
00:11:20.033 --> 00:11:22.300 line:82%
Someone who ruins the atmosphere moved in.

194
00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:23.500 line:82%
Unit 613?

195
00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:27.333 line:82%
You guys are absolutely crazy!

196
00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:33.834 line:82%
Should we go up there?

197
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.400 line:82%
There might be clues here.

198
00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:40.934 line:82%
There are strange items regarding Y2K.

199
00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:48.333 line:82%
The fish cake soup is great.

200
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.500 line:82%
I'll take one warm fried chicken.

201
00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:52.533 line:82%
What could it be?
There are no clues right now.

202
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.667 line:82%
Their heads are in the clouds.

203
00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:56.834 line:82%
No one is putting down their food.
Let's go.

204
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.100 line:82%
-We only talk about putting it down.
-Let's go.

205
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.133 line:82%
Hope you sell a lot. Thank you.

206
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.600 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Hope you sell a lot.

207
00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:06.433 line:82%
I bought some chicken.

208
00:12:07.233 --> 00:12:08.734 line:82%
Let's go.

209
00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:14.800 line:82%
-I'm scared.
-I'll take the lead.

210
00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:16.333 line:82%
Something might jump out, JENNIE.

211
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.166 line:82%
-She's confident.
-Drugs--

212
00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:20.533 line:82%
There could be drugs, JENNIE.

213
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.033 line:82%
This must be the unit.

214
00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:28.867 line:82%
GET LOST

215
00:12:28.934 --> 00:12:30.800 line:82%
CRAZY BASTARD, DEVIL

216
00:12:30.867 --> 00:12:31.867 line:82%
YOU'LL BE PUNISHED!

217
00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:33.200 line:82%
I found the unit.

218
00:12:33.266 --> 00:12:36.166 line:82%
-What's this?
-"Cursed bastard. Garbage."

219
00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:37.500 line:82%
"Get lost."

220
00:12:37.567 --> 00:12:39.200 line:82%
-Shall we open the door?
-Shall we?

221
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.066 line:82%
-Is it locked?
-This must be a lock.

222
00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:45.000 line:82%
We can't open it.
I guess we need to do something.

223
00:12:49.667 --> 00:12:51.633 line:82%
We need a key.

224
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.734 line:82%
-Is anyone home?
-The security guard is here.

225
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.467 line:82%
-Sir, the door is locked.
-It's locked.

226
00:12:56.533 --> 00:12:59.033 line:82%
-Yes, the door is locked.
-What's this?

227
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.133 line:82%
The resident of unit 613
has many problems.

228
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.100 line:82%
That's why things are chaotic and strange
at the apartment.

229
00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:09.500 line:82%
You should go home for now.

230
00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:11.266 line:82%
-Really?
-Can't we go inside?

231
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:13.600 line:82%
-No. Please go home for now.
-Is that so?

232
00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:16.233 line:82%
-Things are eerie.
-What's this?

233
00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:19.033 line:82%
Gosh, he's at it again.

234
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.433 line:82%
He's a druggie. For goodness' sake.

235
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.800 line:82%
Tae-hyun got demoted already.

236
00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:27.533 line:82%
Did I get demoted?

237
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.133 line:82%
It's the elderly versus the youngsters.

238
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.734 line:82%
Wasn't I a fixed member of the Yus?

239
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.567 line:82%
-The Yangs.
-Jae-seok.

240
00:13:35.633 --> 00:13:37.266 line:82%
-See you later.
-Tae-hyun.

241
00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:40.500 line:82%
Let me tell you this in advance.
Se-chan can't see the big picture.

242
00:13:40.567 --> 00:13:42.533 line:82%
Don't worry. I'll show you.

243
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.133 line:82%
Put the slippers on. What?

244
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.367 line:82%
My family had a sofa like that.

245
00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:55.133 line:82%
This is incredible. It's an actual home.

246
00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:02.333 line:82%
It's an exact replica of an old apartment.
Gosh.

247
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.000 line:82%
-Jae-seok, there's a photo of me.
-Where?

248
00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:15.066 line:82%
A photo of me.

249
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.000 line:82%
Gosh, Jae-seok is here too.

250
00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.767 line:82%
It was like that in real life.
You were a star.

251
00:14:29.834 --> 00:14:32.000 line:82%
-There's a photo of you too.
-I wasn't a star.

252
00:14:32.066 --> 00:14:34.667 line:82%
In the early 2000s,
things looked up for me.

253
00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:36.800 line:82%
Tae-hyun was a teen star.

254
00:14:50.967 --> 00:14:53.734 line:82%
I wasn't a major star,
but my career was beginning to take off.

255
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.066 line:82%
-Is that you?
-Yes.

256
00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:56.133 line:82%
You look cool here.

257
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.200 line:82%
-I look nice, right?
-Yes.

258
00:14:57.266 --> 00:15:00.200 line:82%
-I didn't look half bad.
-You looked very cool back then.

259
00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.800 line:82%
A mermaid?

260
00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:05.333 line:82%
Here comes 1,000 won!

261
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.767 line:82%
Yu Jae-seok.

262
00:15:07.834 --> 00:15:09.967 line:82%
Let's enter the Yangs' house.

263
00:15:10.834 --> 00:15:12.834 line:82%
Don't worry. I'll show you.

264
00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:20.400 line:82%
This feels like my grandma's house.

265
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.200 line:82%
This same closet was in my childhood home.

266
00:15:28.266 --> 00:15:29.900 line:82%
My goodness.

267
00:15:29.967 --> 00:15:31.834 line:82%
-I collected them.
-I've never seen these.

268
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.100 line:82%
-We're set.
-Look at the bathtub.

269
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.934 line:82%
Let's find the clues.

270
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.667 line:82%
Come on, guys. Let's take our time.

271
00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.266 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Let's take our time.

272
00:15:45.333 --> 00:15:46.934 line:82%
-Today…
-Hey.

273
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.333 line:82%
We're young.

274
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.567 line:82%
We're young.

275
00:15:50.633 --> 00:15:53.467 line:82%
-We're young.
-We're young.

276
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.900 line:82%
The average age dropped.

277
00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:03.600 line:82%
It's nice. This is it.

278
00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:05.433 line:82%
-The clues are ours today.
-They're ours.

279
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.200 line:82%
-Let's search the rooms as we always do.
-Let's do that.

280
00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:09.333 line:82%
Here it is.

281
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400 line:82%
Yes.

282
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.800 line:82%
Last week, there was a diary.

283
00:16:14.867 --> 00:16:16.066 line:82%
There's nothing.

284
00:16:18.033 --> 00:16:20.700 line:82%
-There's something here.
-The times table.

285
00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:22.667 line:82%
Here. Two times four is eight.

286
00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:24.367 line:82%
Two times four is eight.

287
00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:29.133 line:82%
And what do we have here?

288
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.433 line:82%
There's a part that's highlighted.

289
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.967 line:82%
"Will our relationship reach my yearning?

290
00:16:50.033 --> 00:16:52.266 line:82%
Time passes askew."

291
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.633 line:82%
What?

292
00:16:56.734 --> 00:16:59.800 line:82%
"Will our relationship reach my yearning?
Time passes askew."

293
00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:01.333 line:82%
Look at this.

294
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.066 line:82%
It says, "Will our relationship reach
my yearning?"

295
00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:07.567 line:82%
Maybe it's about Tae-hyun's commercial.

296
00:17:07.633 --> 00:17:09.133 line:82%
-No. Hey.
-You don't think so?

297
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.467 line:82%
-JENNIE, let's discard him.
-Se-chan.

298
00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:13.567 line:82%
Why?

299
00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:16.433 line:82%
Hey, you need to get a grip.
I can't believe you.

300
00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:20.200 line:82%
-Today, the decor is simple.
-Right?

301
00:17:20.266 --> 00:17:22.200 line:82%
Ninety-nine, ninety-eight…

302
00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:23.500 line:82%
-Se-chan.
-What is it?

303
00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:28.000 line:82%
There's another one.

304
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.433 line:82%
There's another one.

305
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.066 line:82%
There are more baskets, right?

306
00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:40.800 line:82%
Let's discard Jung-ha, Se-chan.

307
00:17:40.867 --> 00:17:43.400 line:82%
Jung-ha has no talent for deducting.

308
00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:44.734 line:82%
-He's clumsy, right?
-Yes.

309
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.333 line:82%
I have him pegged.

310
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.433 line:82%
JENNIE, we were cheering together
just a moment ago.

311
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.700 line:82%
-I know.
-Discarding him so soon…

312
00:17:51.266 --> 00:17:52.300 line:82%
Embrace me.

313
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400 line:82%
That's right.

314
00:17:58.233 --> 00:17:59.467 line:82%
Come on in.

315
00:18:00.433 --> 00:18:02.467 line:82%
-Do you like sandwiches?
-Yes.

316
00:18:02.533 --> 00:18:04.367 line:82%
Eat a sandwich and get a grip.

317
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.433 line:82%
Thank you for the food.

318
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.300 line:82%
-It's so painful to choose what to eat.
-I know.

319
00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:11.800 line:82%
-They're all tasty.
-I know.

320
00:18:11.867 --> 00:18:14.033 line:82%
You know the recommended sandwiches?

321
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.700 line:82%
I just order one of them.

322
00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:16.967 line:82%
-It's convenient.
-Yes.

323
00:18:17.033 --> 00:18:18.633 line:82%
-It looks delicious.
-Yes.

324
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.633 line:82%
This is it.

325
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.567 line:82%
It gives you the best combination.

326
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.033 line:82%
There's a lot to eat today.

327
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.133 line:82%
I absolutely love sandwiches.

328
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.767 line:82%
It's nice to begin filming
with a hearty breakfast.

329
00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:32.233 line:82%
I like that it's convenient to order.

330
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.767 line:82%
It's tasty.

331
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.000 line:82%
In my opinion, we haven't fully grasped

332
00:18:39.066 --> 00:18:42.200 line:82%
-what's happening today.
-That's right.

333
00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:47.800 line:82%
Jae-seok, we need to teach
those kiddos a lesson.

334
00:18:47.867 --> 00:18:50.333 line:82%
-You… What's wrong with you?
-"Kiddos"?

335
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.367 line:82%
Why do you feel so attacked by the youth?

336
00:18:52.433 --> 00:18:54.967 line:82%
Jae-seok, our team's youngest member
is 47 years old.

337
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.834 line:82%
Hey.

338
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.900 line:82%
All of us are a year apart.

339
00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:05.367 line:82%
Seriously. That's so funny.

340
00:19:05.934 --> 00:19:07.367 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Hey.

341
00:19:07.433 --> 00:19:10.233 line:82%
-It's the end of the century.
-Right?

342
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.567 line:82%
I just entered my thirties,
and you guys are in your twenties.

343
00:19:12.633 --> 00:19:13.633 line:82%
I'm in my twenties.

344
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.667 line:82%
-You're right.
-That's right.

345
00:19:15.734 --> 00:19:18.934 line:82%
Look at the calendar.
It's December of 1999.

346
00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:24.066 line:82%
-What?
-What is it?

347
00:19:25.133 --> 00:19:26.300 line:82%
It's the symbol I saw earlier.

348
00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:28.500 line:82%
What?

349
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.300 line:82%
You can put the money in here.

350
00:19:31.867 --> 00:19:34.000 line:82%
What's this symbol here?

351
00:19:36.934 --> 00:19:39.667 line:82%
-That symbol was on the dalgona.
-That's right.

352
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.533 line:82%
Isn't it a cow?
I think those are cow horns. Cow.

353
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.633 line:82%
What's that symbol?

354
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.967 line:82%
Jae-seok, we have an advantage.

355
00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:51.133 line:82%
-They have no knowledge.
-Not at all.

356
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.033 line:82%
-They have no knowledge.
-You know,

357
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.433 line:82%
their team leader is Se-chan.

358
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.400 line:82%
-Se-chan has no idea what Y2K is.
-He doesn't have a clue.

359
00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:04.300 line:82%
Still, you know the era better than we do.

360
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.433 line:82%
What? I guess so.

361
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.233 line:82%
-We were babies.
-You guys were babies.

362
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.834 line:82%
-I was two years old.
-I was three or four years old.

363
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.900 line:82%
We already received a hint.
The theme is drugs.

364
00:20:14.967 --> 00:20:16.367 line:82%
I agree that it's drugs, but…

365
00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:18.934 line:82%
Will we have to catch a drug dealer? Or…

366
00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:24.467 line:82%
But we did figure something out. The bull.

367
00:20:25.033 --> 00:20:26.734 line:82%
-The symbol.
-Yes, there was a symbol.

368
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.166 line:82%
The symbol belongs to…

369
00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:31.433 line:82%
-An organization.
-That's right.

370
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.567 line:82%
An organization.

371
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.700 line:82%
-It must be a drug cartel's symbol.
-Symbol.

372
00:20:36.767 --> 00:20:38.934 line:82%
We paid money for the food earlier.

373
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.100 line:82%
-It'll go to them.
-We've become accomplices.

374
00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:43.967 line:82%
The forks had the same symbol,

375
00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:45.467 line:82%
so we've become accomplices.

376
00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:48.667 line:82%
I figured it out.
I think I might be a genius.

377
00:20:48.734 --> 00:20:52.800 line:82%
Someone is trying to rope us
into the drug cartel.

378
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.567 line:82%
You think it could be Tae-hyun?

379
00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:04.567 line:82%
-In any case--
-You know,

380
00:21:04.633 --> 00:21:07.166 line:82%
JENNIE isn't listening
to anything you say.

381
00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:09.100 line:82%
She discarded you, Jung-ha.

382
00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:12.400 line:82%
I'm sorry, but you should go home
after enjoying the sandwich.

383
00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:14.200 line:82%
It's so tasty.

384
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.633 line:82%
"Now" by Fin.K.L.

385
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.100 line:82%
-
One ant, yeah, two ants, yeah
-
Yeah

386
00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:24.867 line:82%
-It has been a while since I met Ok.
-I know.

387
00:21:24.934 --> 00:21:27.500 line:82%
Why are there
so many Fin.K.L-related things?

388
00:21:27.567 --> 00:21:30.834 line:82%
-There's no S.E.S. Just Fin.K.L.
-It's just Fin.K.L.

389
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.367 line:82%
-You're right.
-Yes.

390
00:21:32.433 --> 00:21:33.800 line:82%
That was a sharp observation.

391
00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.867 line:82%
Is Fin.K.L related to this case?

392
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.567 line:82%
Good.

393
00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:43.000 line:82%
-What's good about it?
-What's good about it?

394
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.767 line:82%
What are they doing?

395
00:21:46.834 --> 00:21:47.834 line:82%
What are they doing?

396
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.900 line:82%
-I think they found something.
-There's something.

397
00:21:49.967 --> 00:21:52.333 line:82%
-Let's stop eating and look around.
-Hold on.

398
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.767 line:82%
I should drop by.

399
00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:55.100 line:82%
I think they found something.

400
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:56.834 line:82%
They must have something.

401
00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:04.867 line:82%
They're intentionally being loud
so that we'll hear.

402
00:22:09.233 --> 00:22:12.200 line:82%
The hint was always inside the unit.

403
00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:13.900 line:82%
-Yes, always.
-Without fail.

404
00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:15.367 line:82%
Listen.

405
00:22:15.433 --> 00:22:18.967 line:82%
Four times two is eight.
Solve that riddle, Se-chan.

406
00:22:19.033 --> 00:22:20.367 line:82%
-Four times two is eight.
-Yes.

407
00:22:20.433 --> 00:22:23.233 line:82%
-Four and two.
-Eight and two.

408
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.633 line:82%
Se-chan, we have to hide it.
Maybe the other unit doesn't have it.

409
00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:32.467 line:82%
Jae-seok, hello.

410
00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:34.734 line:82%
-Jae-seok, hello. Welcome.
-Hello.

411
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.367 line:82%
-JENNIE, why were you surprised?
-What?

412
00:22:37.433 --> 00:22:38.800 line:82%
I was just happy to see you.

413
00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:41.233 line:82%
-Why were you surprised?
-We were eating. Don't come in.

414
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.400 line:82%
You yelled as if you found something.

415
00:22:43.467 --> 00:22:45.166 line:82%
-Because the sandwich was so good.
-What?

416
00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:53.734 line:82%
"Will our relationship reach my yearning?
Time passes askew."

417
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.900 line:82%
Jae-seok, you can't just come in like this
and search our unit.

418
00:22:56.967 --> 00:22:59.834 line:82%
Hey, the door was open.

419
00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:04.400 line:82%
"Our relationship"? What?

420
00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:11.000 line:82%
Forget it. I saw the cards already.

421
00:23:11.066 --> 00:23:12.367 line:82%
You saw the cards?

422
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.967 line:82%
You were talking
about Song Seung-heon earlier.

423
00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:23.333 line:82%
Me?

424
00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:25.667 line:82%
You know,

425
00:23:25.734 --> 00:23:27.734 line:82%
she looked at me and went…

426
00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:31.433 line:82%
"Jae-seok, hello."

427
00:23:32.867 --> 00:23:34.467 line:82%
What was that?

428
00:23:34.533 --> 00:23:35.567 line:82%
-For now--
-For now,

429
00:23:35.633 --> 00:23:37.900 line:82%
-let's go. We need to play a game.
-Let's go.

430
00:23:38.467 --> 00:23:41.000 line:82%
I don't have a clue.
We shouldn't have come here.

431
00:23:41.066 --> 00:23:46.567 line:82%
-
Please be my side
-
…be my side

432
00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:48.867 line:82%
Being with them makes me young.

433
00:23:48.934 --> 00:23:51.700 line:82%
-Is it nice and refreshing?
-The team isn't complete without you.

434
00:23:51.767 --> 00:23:53.266 line:82%
-Really?
-Of course.

435
00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:55.433 line:82%
Shall I join this team?
That team is too dreary.

436
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.767 line:82%
-They're middle-aged men.
-Seriously.

437
00:23:57.834 --> 00:23:59.767 line:82%
-Guess what the average age is.
-What is it?

438
00:23:59.834 --> 00:24:02.834 line:82%
-It's 48.
-What?

439
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.900 line:82%
Breaking news.

440
00:24:10.967 --> 00:24:13.934 line:82%
…regarding doomsday predictions
and the millennium bug…

441
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.166 line:82%
It's about Y2K.

442
00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:17.567 line:82%
Drug use among youth has increased.

443
00:24:18.767 --> 00:24:20.667 line:82%
-What?
-What?

444
00:24:20.734 --> 00:24:23.233 line:82%
He's a druggie. For goodness' sake.

445
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.633 line:82%
What? It's the symbol I saw earlier.

446
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.767 line:82%
By the way, what's this?

447
00:24:27.834 --> 00:24:29.066 line:82%
What's this symbol here?

448
00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:30.533 line:82%
Four times two is eight.

449
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.100 line:82%
"Will our relationship reach my yearning?
Time passes askew."

450
00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:37.033 line:82%
The hint was always inside the unit.

451
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.533 line:82%
-Yes, always.
-Without fail.

452
00:24:42.633 --> 00:24:44.333 line:82%
You should give us something.

453
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.133 line:82%
-There's nothing.
-Okay.

454
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.700 line:82%
I don't even have a hunch.

455
00:24:47.767 --> 00:24:48.934 line:82%
What's going on today?

456
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.000 line:82%
-Is there a spy?
-I really figured it out.

457
00:24:53.066 --> 00:24:53.900 line:82%
Who's a spy?

458
00:24:53.967 --> 00:24:56.367 line:82%
Things are chaotic in the apartment.

459
00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:58.433 line:82%
The game you'll play today is…

460
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.600 line:82%
the Hide-And-Seek of Death.

461
00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:02.000 line:82%
What is it?

462
00:25:02.066 --> 00:25:02.900 line:82%
H.D.

463
00:25:02.967 --> 00:25:05.467 line:82%
-"H.D."? Do you know what it is?
-No.

464
00:25:05.533 --> 00:25:08.233 line:82%
-There'll be an offense and a defense.
-Okay.

465
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.600 line:82%
The defense will have
five minutes to hide.

466
00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:15.100 line:82%
-
You can hide anywhere in either unit.
-
Okay.

467
00:25:15.166 --> 00:25:16.433 line:82%
-
Really?
-
Either unit?

468
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.700 line:82%
The time limit is ten minutes.

469
00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:19.667 line:82%
And the offense

470
00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:21.900 line:82%
-must link arms when they enter.
-Okay.

471
00:25:21.967 --> 00:25:24.233 line:82%
Here's the most important rule.

472
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.033 line:82%
Let's say you find a hider.
Then you play a game.

473
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.333 line:82%
When you find one, play Dibidibi Dip.

474
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.900 line:82%
When you find the second one,
play Cham, Cham, Cham.

475
00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:34.734 line:82%
Third, the Human Zero Game.

476
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.633 line:82%
One.

477
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.700 line:82%
If you fail, you must start over.

478
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.600 line:82%
-
That team will win.
-
Good.

479
00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:45.800 line:82%
Your explanation is spot on today.

480
00:25:45.867 --> 00:25:47.033 line:82%
I practiced a lot.

481
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.633 line:82%
-JENNIE, did he improve?
-Yes.

482
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.000 line:82%
-I understood.
-Well done, Woo-il.

483
00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:52.633 line:82%
I wanted to see you guys every week,

484
00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.967 line:82%
-so I practiced hard.
-That's good.

485
00:25:56.033 --> 00:25:58.934 line:82%
Hiders, please hide.
You have five minutes.

486
00:25:59.967 --> 00:26:01.500 line:82%
Hold on. Where should I hide?

487
00:26:02.633 --> 00:26:03.834 line:82%
Where should I hide?

488
00:26:04.533 --> 00:26:06.033 line:82%
Even if you hide…

489
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.333 line:82%
-It's meaningless.
-Hiding is meaningless.

490
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.967 line:82%
We need to play the game well
and beat them.

491
00:26:11.033 --> 00:26:13.200 line:82%
Still, if we hide well…

492
00:26:13.266 --> 00:26:14.967 line:82%
Where should I hide?

493
00:26:15.834 --> 00:26:18.500 line:82%
-If they can't find us, we'll buy time.
-Yes. Of course.

494
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.433 line:82%
It'll be game over.

495
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.100 line:82%
Finders,

496
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:45.300 line:82%
-please wait out in the hall.
-Okay.

497
00:26:45.367 --> 00:26:46.800 line:82%
-Can you play Dibidibi Dip?
-Yes.

498
00:26:46.867 --> 00:26:49.433 line:82%
Then you should play Dibidibi Dip,
and you play Cham, Cham, Cham.

499
00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.667 line:82%
-Do it in the center.
-Yes.

500
00:26:51.734 --> 00:26:52.567 line:82%
Okay.

501
00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:54.667 line:82%
-There's nowhere to hide.
-One…

502
00:26:54.734 --> 00:26:57.133 line:82%
You can hide in the closet, under the bed…

503
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.967 line:82%
Where should I hide? Where should I hide?

504
00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.333 line:82%
They'll check under the blanket
no matter what.

505
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.400 line:82%
My back hurts.

506
00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:06.734 line:82%
Can you not see me?

507
00:27:08.266 --> 00:27:10.000 line:82%
They'll never find me.

508
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.400 line:82%
One, two, three.

509
00:27:12.467 --> 00:27:13.700 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

510
00:27:13.767 --> 00:27:15.734 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go to unit 406.

511
00:27:16.533 --> 00:27:18.800 line:82%
There's nowhere to hide
other than the closet.

512
00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:22.533 line:82%
What? It's empty.

513
00:27:24.967 --> 00:27:27.600 line:82%
-It's empty. It's the other room.
-I guess so.

514
00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:29.500 line:82%
-Go.
-Really? Don't you need to check?

515
00:27:29.567 --> 00:27:31.266 line:82%
Really? Don't you need to check?

516
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:33.000 line:82%
Let's check over there.

517
00:27:33.066 --> 00:27:34.333 line:82%
-Come here.
-Jung-ha, come here.

518
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:35.900 line:82%
-Come on.
-Come here.

519
00:27:35.967 --> 00:27:39.033 line:82%
No hiding behind the camera.

520
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.433 line:82%
Okay. No one is here.

521
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.200 line:82%
-Let's go.
-No one is in this unit.

522
00:27:43.266 --> 00:27:44.867 line:82%
-Come on.
-Let's go.

523
00:27:54.166 --> 00:27:55.800 line:82%
There's no place to hide.

524
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.000 line:82%
Mr. Producer, please stack the blankets
on top of me.

525
00:28:08.567 --> 00:28:10.300 line:82%
Please cover me completely.

526
00:28:11.233 --> 00:28:12.734 line:82%
Please cover my face too.

527
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.200 line:82%
Can you breathe?

528
00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:17.433 line:82%
Can you not see me?

529
00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:23.934 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Forget the shoes.

530
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.633 line:82%
-Forget your shoes? My goodness.
-Forget your shoes.

531
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.066 line:82%
-There's one. Okay.
-There's one.

532
00:28:34.133 --> 00:28:35.967 line:82%
-There's one. Okay.
-There's one.

533
00:28:36.033 --> 00:28:38.567 line:82%
-What? What's going on?
-Where is everyone?

534
00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:41.500 line:82%
-What? What's going on?
-Where is everyone?

535
00:28:41.567 --> 00:28:42.834 line:82%
Are they moving around to avoid us?

536
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.367 line:82%
-No way.
-They can't do that.

537
00:28:44.433 --> 00:28:46.500 line:82%
Is someone in there? That'd be impossible.

538
00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:48.467 line:82%
-No way. That'd be impossible.
-Come on.

539
00:28:48.533 --> 00:28:50.266 line:82%
-Where are they?
-Where? The restroom?

540
00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:51.900 line:82%
-What? Where are they?
-Come on.

541
00:28:51.967 --> 00:28:53.767 line:82%
-Where are they?
-Where? The restroom?

542
00:28:53.834 --> 00:28:55.767 line:82%
-What? Where are they?
-Come on.

543
00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.633 line:82%
No hiding behind the cameras.

544
00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.333 line:82%
-The curtains.
-What's going on?

545
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.567 line:82%
Behind the curtains? I can't believe it.

546
00:29:01.633 --> 00:29:03.100 line:82%
Behind the cameras…

547
00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:04.633 line:82%
You can't hide behind the cameras.

548
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.633 line:82%
Are they behind the cameras in that unit?

549
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.100 line:82%
This makes no sense.

550
00:29:08.166 --> 00:29:09.266 line:82%
They disappeared.

551
00:29:09.333 --> 00:29:10.333 line:82%
What's going on?

552
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.900 line:82%
You guys are no match for us.

553
00:29:13.967 --> 00:29:15.867 line:82%
-How fascinating.
-They're holding the cameras.

554
00:29:15.934 --> 00:29:17.633 line:82%
-Seriously.
-That's the only way.

555
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.467 line:82%
Did they have to go that far?

556
00:29:19.533 --> 00:29:23.467 line:82%
-I mean…
-Someone's here.

557
00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:25.233 line:82%
-Where?
-For goodness' sake.

558
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.700 line:82%
-Oh, my gosh!
-Get up quickly.

559
00:29:27.734 --> 00:29:32.066 line:82%
-Oh, my gosh!
-Get up quickly.

560
00:29:32.133 --> 00:29:33.834 line:82%
-How did you find me?
-Go.

561
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.100 line:82%
Ready, go.

562
00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:36.233 line:82%
Dibidibi dip.

563
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.967 line:82%
Dibidibi dip.

564
00:29:39.433 --> 00:29:42.100 line:82%
Dibidibi dip.

565
00:29:42.166 --> 00:29:44.066 line:82%
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

566
00:29:44.133 --> 00:29:46.367 line:82%
I'm sorry. Let's hurry up.

567
00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:48.166 line:82%
-Let's hurry up.
-Yes.

568
00:29:48.233 --> 00:29:49.667 line:82%
-Where are they?
-Hurry.

569
00:29:49.734 --> 00:29:51.800 line:82%
-Tap me.
-Where are they?

570
00:29:51.867 --> 00:29:53.166 line:82%
-Link arms.
-My goodness.

571
00:29:53.233 --> 00:29:55.900 line:82%
-You can't hide behind the cameras.
-My goodness.

572
00:29:55.967 --> 00:29:58.633 line:82%
-Where are Jae-seok and Tae-hyun?
-Let's check here.

573
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.200 line:82%
-I'm curious too. Still looking?
-Under the rice cooker.

574
00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.233 line:82%
-Still looking?
-Yes.

575
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.400 line:82%
-Where are they?
-They aren't here.

576
00:30:04.467 --> 00:30:05.867 line:82%
-Seriously.
-This is insane.

577
00:30:05.934 --> 00:30:07.700 line:82%
It's so fascinating.

578
00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:11.000 line:82%
You know, it makes no sense.

579
00:30:11.567 --> 00:30:12.800 line:82%
It makes no sense.

580
00:30:12.867 --> 00:30:14.667 line:82%
-It makes no sense.
-The other unit?

581
00:30:14.734 --> 00:30:16.066 line:82%
-The other unit.
-Let's go.

582
00:30:16.133 --> 00:30:17.633 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Where are they?

583
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.900 line:82%
-It makes no sense.
-There's nowhere left to look.

584
00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:21.567 line:82%
Seriously, where did they go?

585
00:30:21.633 --> 00:30:24.633 line:82%
Seriously, where are they?

586
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.533 line:82%
Where are they?

587
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.533 line:82%
There's no place left to hide.

588
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.600 line:82%
-There's nowhere left.
-This is annoying.

589
00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:34.734 line:82%
-I don't understand.
-Are they in the boxes?

590
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.400 line:82%
-Are they in the boxes?
-Hey!

591
00:30:41.233 --> 00:30:42.400 line:82%
Where did they go?

592
00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:43.533 line:82%
It makes no sense.

593
00:30:45.133 --> 00:30:47.533 line:82%
-Why did you open the drawer?
-It makes no sense.

594
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.900 line:82%
These men are insane.

595
00:30:49.967 --> 00:30:52.066 line:82%
Exactly how do they play
with their children?

596
00:30:52.133 --> 00:30:53.934 line:82%
-Hold on.
-It makes no sense.

597
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.367 line:82%
-Let's go back.
-Let's go back.

598
00:30:56.433 --> 00:30:58.200 line:82%
Where are they hiding?

599
00:30:58.767 --> 00:31:01.500 line:82%
Wait, how did they hide so well?

600
00:31:01.567 --> 00:31:02.700 line:82%
It makes no sense.

601
00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:05.433 line:82%
They aren't behind the TV.
It can't be this room.

602
00:31:06.133 --> 00:31:08.166 line:82%
-He's here.
-No way!

603
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.533 line:82%
-He's here.
-No way!

604
00:31:11.033 --> 00:31:12.600 line:82%
Jae-seok!

605
00:31:12.667 --> 00:31:16.500 line:82%
-He's here.
-No way! Jae-seok!

606
00:31:17.533 --> 00:31:20.266 line:82%
-He fits in there because he's skinny.
-Unbelievable.

607
00:31:20.333 --> 00:31:22.467 line:82%
-Gosh, my back.
-I can't believe you.

608
00:31:26.533 --> 00:31:27.533 line:82%
This spot…

609
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.533 line:82%
I'm sure they'll open it.

610
00:31:32.033 --> 00:31:33.667 line:82%
Unless you're Yogi Daniel…

611
00:31:33.734 --> 00:31:34.867 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

612
00:31:43.533 --> 00:31:44.533 line:82%
Shut the doors.

613
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.567 line:82%
-What?
-Cham, Cham, Cham.

614
00:31:49.633 --> 00:31:51.767 line:82%
-Cham, Cham, Cham?
-Cham, cham, cham.

615
00:31:51.834 --> 00:31:53.567 line:82%
-Okay.
-Come on.

616
00:31:54.967 --> 00:31:56.100 line:82%
-Cham, cham, cham.
-Okay.

617
00:31:57.467 --> 00:31:59.066 line:82%
-Cham, cham, cham.
-Okay.

618
00:31:59.133 --> 00:32:00.567 line:82%
-Cham, cham, cham.
-Okay.

619
00:32:00.633 --> 00:32:02.367 line:82%
One more left to go. Tae-hyun.

620
00:32:02.433 --> 00:32:05.233 line:82%
-Open everything. He could be anywhere.
-Still looking for Tae-hyun?

621
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.867 line:82%
He can't be in here.

622
00:32:07.934 --> 00:32:10.066 line:82%
Did you open the thermos?

623
00:32:10.133 --> 00:32:11.467 line:82%
-The thermos?
-I think

624
00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:13.233 line:82%
-we should open it.
-Let's open it.

625
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.834 line:82%
Where is he? Is he inside a thermos?

626
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.600 line:82%
-Where did Tae-hyun go?
-Seriously.

627
00:32:17.667 --> 00:32:20.166 line:82%
-He disappeared for real.
-Where did he go?

628
00:32:21.066 --> 00:32:22.633 line:82%
They won't be able to find me.

629
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.266 line:82%
Shall we go back to the other unit?

630
00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:30.800 line:82%
-What should we do? Let's go back.
-
Five.

631
00:32:30.867 --> 00:32:32.767 line:82%
-
Four. Three.
-He's nowhere to be found.

632
00:32:32.834 --> 00:32:34.600 line:82%
-He disappeared.
-
Two. One.

633
00:32:34.667 --> 00:32:35.834 line:82%
Where is he?

634
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.200 line:82%
Hold on. We're going to find him.

635
00:32:38.266 --> 00:32:39.266 line:82%
Where is he?

636
00:32:40.967 --> 00:32:42.266 line:82%
We won.

637
00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:44.867 line:82%
-Where is Tae-hyun?
-Where did he go?

638
00:32:45.367 --> 00:32:47.266 line:82%
-I bet he's in there. Did you open it?
-Open what?

639
00:32:47.333 --> 00:32:49.433 line:82%
-No way. We were here.
-No way.

640
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.033 line:82%
-He can't be here.
-Open it.

641
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.100 line:82%
No way.

642
00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:54.967 line:82%
-My goodness.
-Gosh, you were hiding in there.

643
00:32:55.033 --> 00:32:57.100 line:82%
-My goodness.
-Gosh, you were hiding in there.

644
00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:59.533 line:82%
How scary.

645
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.500 line:82%
See? You should've opened it.
Why didn't you open it?

646
00:33:02.567 --> 00:33:04.100 line:82%
He wasn't behind the cameras.

647
00:33:06.266 --> 00:33:07.667 line:82%
It'll be game over.

648
00:33:10.433 --> 00:33:12.400 line:82%
It'll be game over.

649
00:33:24.734 --> 00:33:27.900 line:82%
You can't beat a dad in hide-and-seek.

650
00:33:29.133 --> 00:33:31.300 line:82%
Is this your first time playing
hide-and-seek?

651
00:33:31.367 --> 00:33:33.767 line:82%
-People don't go that far.
-Yes, they do.

652
00:33:33.834 --> 00:33:35.533 line:82%
-How did you go in there?
-The cabinet…

653
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.533 line:82%
I'm sorry, but you can't beat dads
in hide-and-seek.

654
00:33:40.233 --> 00:33:42.000 line:82%
-I'm flabbergasted.
-Seriously.

655
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.600 line:82%
Let's switch sides
and play the game again.

656
00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:47.467 line:82%
Try hard this time.

657
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.100 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

658
00:33:52.867 --> 00:33:54.033 line:82%
What should I do?

659
00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:57.633 line:82%
This compartment is smaller.

660
00:33:59.133 --> 00:34:00.800 line:82%
I'll make it work.

661
00:34:08.033 --> 00:34:10.300 line:82%
They won't find me here.

662
00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:40.767 line:82%
JENNIE, is this obvious?

663
00:34:40.834 --> 00:34:42.800 line:82%
-What?
-Is this obvious?

664
00:34:44.367 --> 00:34:46.934 line:82%
Will you be okay?
Should I put this over you?

665
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.767 line:82%
Hey, it's too obvious.
They'll find you right away.

666
00:34:50.834 --> 00:34:51.900 line:82%
Really?

667
00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:56.100 line:82%
I'm doomed.

668
00:35:15.633 --> 00:35:18.233 line:82%
It'll take a long time.
There's no place to hide.

669
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.867 line:82%
They can't hide where we hid.

670
00:35:19.934 --> 00:35:21.300 line:82%
No, they can't.

671
00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:23.633 line:82%
-People evolve.
-That's ridiculous.

672
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.500 line:82%
People evolve.

673
00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:38.333 line:82%
-Find them.
-Okay.

674
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.400 line:82%
-Let's go.
-We need to find them quickly.

675
00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.900 line:82%
-Where are they?
-We'll find them in no time.

676
00:35:44.967 --> 00:35:47.200 line:82%
-Hold on.
-I see you.

677
00:35:47.266 --> 00:35:49.033 line:82%
-I see those punks.
-I see you.

678
00:35:52.066 --> 00:35:54.600 line:82%
It'd make sense to open it first.

679
00:35:54.667 --> 00:35:57.133 line:82%
-They might try to win by hiding.
-That's right.

680
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.700 line:82%
-That's right.
-Right?

681
00:35:58.767 --> 00:35:59.900 line:82%
-Not here.
-Not here.

682
00:35:59.967 --> 00:36:01.700 line:82%
-They aren't here. It's too tight.
-Come here.

683
00:36:01.767 --> 00:36:02.633 line:82%
Okay.

684
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.700 line:82%
Let's go.

685
00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:05.734 line:82%
-You need to link arms.
-Okay.

686
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:11.567 line:82%
I know that you guys are here.

687
00:36:11.633 --> 00:36:14.266 line:82%
-I know that you guys are here.
-Here's one.

688
00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:16.100 line:82%
I know that you're in this room.

689
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:17.333 line:82%
-Someone's there.
-Totally.

690
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.133 line:82%
-Was it obvious?
-It was very obvious.

691
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.767 line:82%
-Someone's there.
-Totally.

692
00:36:20.834 --> 00:36:22.533 line:82%
-Was it obvious?
-It was very obvious.

693
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.567 line:82%
Dibidibi Dip. Go.

694
00:36:24.633 --> 00:36:26.033 line:82%
All right. Dibidibi dip.

695
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.467 line:82%
-Okay.
-Success.

696
00:36:27.533 --> 00:36:28.533 line:82%
Dibidibi dip.

697
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.734 line:82%
-Okay.
-Success.

698
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.233 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-His hair.

699
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.667 line:82%
-His hair got messed up.
-Jung-ha is the cutest.

700
00:36:33.734 --> 00:36:36.467 line:82%
Gosh, I lost again. Se-chan.

701
00:36:36.533 --> 00:36:38.467 line:82%
-Jung-ha is the cutest.
-I know.

702
00:36:38.533 --> 00:36:40.133 line:82%
-Here?
-Open it.

703
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.667 line:82%
She didn't go inside.

704
00:36:41.734 --> 00:36:44.100 line:82%
Look under the bed.

705
00:36:44.166 --> 00:36:48.300 line:82%
-Is she there?
-She's here! Look at her.

706
00:36:48.367 --> 00:36:49.567 line:82%
JENNIE.

707
00:36:49.633 --> 00:36:50.633 line:82%
JENNIE.

708
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.066 line:82%
What's this?

709
00:36:52.133 --> 00:36:54.066 line:82%
-How did you get in there? Hurry.
-Unbelievable.

710
00:36:54.133 --> 00:36:56.800 line:82%
-JENNIE, how did you get in there?
-My face is sweaty.

711
00:36:56.867 --> 00:37:00.367 line:82%
-Give her mouth-to-mouth.
-Cham, Cham, Cham.

712
00:37:00.433 --> 00:37:03.066 line:82%
Unbelievable. I almost left.

713
00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:04.967 line:82%
I didn't think you'd open it.

714
00:37:05.033 --> 00:37:07.834 line:82%
-Cham, Cham, Cham. JENNIE.
-Cham, Cham, Cham.

715
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.367 line:82%
-Cham, cham, cham.
-Okay.

716
00:37:09.433 --> 00:37:10.433 line:82%
Cham, cham, cham.

717
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.934 line:82%
-You did it. Next.
-Okay.

718
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.934 line:82%
-Se-chan.
-Se-chan.

719
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.934 line:82%
-Let's check over here.
-Se-chan.

720
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.433 line:82%
-Empty.
-In there.

721
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.500 line:82%
-Box.
-Check the box.

722
00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:22.367 line:82%
-No way. This box?
-Kick it.

723
00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:24.133 line:82%
-He'd die in here.
-Empty?

724
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.266 line:82%
It's empty.

725
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.333 line:82%
Open the fridge. It took them a while.

726
00:37:32.934 --> 00:37:35.333 line:82%
-They moved things.
-Behind the cameramen.

727
00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:37.200 line:82%
Behind the cameramen.

728
00:37:37.266 --> 00:37:40.333 line:82%
Se-chan hid well.
I can't believe he isn't here.

729
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.166 line:82%
-Behind here.
-He isn't here.

730
00:37:42.233 --> 00:37:44.667 line:82%
-Where did Se-chan go?
-Why are you following us?

731
00:37:44.734 --> 00:37:46.300 line:82%
I want to find Se-chan.

732
00:37:47.233 --> 00:37:48.433 line:82%
Let go of me.

733
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.867 line:82%
Where's Se-chan?

734
00:37:50.934 --> 00:37:52.400 line:82%
Where did Se-chan go?

735
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.800 line:82%
I can't believe Se-chan.

736
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.500 line:82%
You can't go in here, right?

737
00:38:04.567 --> 00:38:06.200 line:82%
It'd be impossible, Jae-seok.

738
00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:09.700 line:82%
I think he's in the duvets.
Is he not in there?

739
00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:11.066 line:82%
No.

740
00:38:14.066 --> 00:38:15.367 line:82%
Where did he go?

741
00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:17.667 line:82%
Where did he hide? Come on out.

742
00:38:17.734 --> 00:38:18.900 line:82%
-Where is he?
-Where?

743
00:38:18.967 --> 00:38:20.834 line:82%
-He's over there.
-Where?

744
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.333 line:82%
-Where?
-There's another storage closet.

745
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.400 line:82%
-Where?
-Where?

746
00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:24.500 line:82%
-Another storage closet.
-Where?

747
00:38:24.567 --> 00:38:26.834 line:82%
-It's on the other side.
-I see.

748
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.734 line:82%
Where is he?

749
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.867 line:82%
-He was in the storage closet.
-I know.

750
00:38:29.934 --> 00:38:32.266 line:82%
-He's in here.
-He's in there?

751
00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:33.600 line:82%
-No.
-He's not?

752
00:38:33.667 --> 00:38:35.600 line:82%
-Here.
-Where?

753
00:38:35.667 --> 00:38:37.000 line:82%
-No.
-He's not?

754
00:38:37.066 --> 00:38:38.700 line:82%
-Here.
-Where?

755
00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:40.934 line:82%
-Here.
-What?

756
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.867 line:82%
-Here.
-What?

757
00:38:42.934 --> 00:38:44.033 line:82%
Help me.

758
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.700 line:82%
I searched that spot earlier.

759
00:38:45.767 --> 00:38:47.066 line:82%
Help me.

760
00:38:47.133 --> 00:38:49.133 line:82%
I searched that spot earlier.

761
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.033 line:82%
No way.

762
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.867 line:82%
-Se-chan.
-I looked over there.

763
00:38:51.934 --> 00:38:53.400 line:82%
-That's where he was.
-You're incredible.

764
00:38:53.467 --> 00:38:54.633 line:82%
What?

765
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.467 line:82%
I was determined to win.

766
00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.867 line:82%
I can't get up there.

767
00:39:10.934 --> 00:39:11.934 line:82%
Help me with this.

768
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.633 line:82%
Hold on.

769
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:15.700 line:82%
Okay. I'm up.

770
00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.533 line:82%
Give me the boxes. Hold on.

771
00:39:22.066 --> 00:39:23.066 line:82%
Hold on.

772
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.667 line:82%
I want to win.

773
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.567 line:82%
Well done.

774
00:39:35.633 --> 00:39:37.033 line:82%
I survived!

775
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.633 line:82%
You're incredible.

776
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.900 line:82%
I thought about looking behind the boxes.

777
00:39:41.967 --> 00:39:43.200 line:82%
My goodness.

778
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.867 line:82%
Youngsters, what do you know
about hide-and-seek?

779
00:39:47.934 --> 00:39:49.333 line:82%
The Yus won.

780
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.000 line:82%
Yes.

781
00:39:51.066 --> 00:39:52.467 line:82%
Our efforts were in vain.

782
00:39:52.533 --> 00:39:54.667 line:82%
Let's go back to our unit.

783
00:39:55.233 --> 00:39:57.333 line:82%
Please go back to your unit.

784
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.200 line:82%
See you later, youngsters.

785
00:39:59.266 --> 00:40:00.700 line:82%
Get some rest.

786
00:40:05.567 --> 00:40:09.800 line:82%
I'll kill all of you.

787
00:40:13.266 --> 00:40:14.867 line:82%
I will get you.

788
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.233 line:82%
All of you need to die.

789
00:40:24.533 --> 00:40:26.867 line:82%
-It's the meal for the winning team.
-What is it?

790
00:40:26.934 --> 00:40:28.100 line:82%
Pork cutlet.

791
00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:29.333 line:82%
King-sized pork cutlets.

792
00:40:30.266 --> 00:40:31.934 line:82%
They're king-sized pork cutlets.

793
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.700 line:82%
-Thank you.
-Okay.

794
00:40:37.767 --> 00:40:39.066 line:82%
What do the Yangs get?

795
00:40:39.133 --> 00:40:41.867 line:82%
They get pork cutlets too,
but they're small.

796
00:40:41.934 --> 00:40:43.233 line:82%
-I see.
-I see.

797
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.533 line:82%
What's inside?

798
00:40:45.734 --> 00:40:46.734 line:82%
Dumplings?

799
00:40:47.734 --> 00:40:49.900 line:82%
-What?
-What?

800
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.433 line:82%
LOOK IN THE SMALL ROOM
IN UNIT 406

801
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.000 line:82%
-"Look in the small room."
-Let's eat first.

802
00:41:01.066 --> 00:41:02.367 line:82%
The small room?

803
00:41:02.433 --> 00:41:05.100 line:82%
-Is this unit 406?
-We need to watch the videotape too.

804
00:41:05.166 --> 00:41:07.000 line:82%
-Is this unit 406?
-No, unit 407.

805
00:41:07.066 --> 00:41:08.066 line:82%
This is unit 407?

806
00:41:08.133 --> 00:41:11.000 line:82%
Unit 406. Why does this keep happening?

807
00:41:11.066 --> 00:41:12.867 line:82%
It's never the unit we're in.

808
00:41:13.367 --> 00:41:15.834 line:82%
-The other unit.
-It's always the other unit.

809
00:41:17.033 --> 00:41:18.800 line:82%
If we go there, they'll suspect us.

810
00:41:23.367 --> 00:41:25.500 line:82%
They cut the pork cutlet for us.

811
00:41:34.467 --> 00:41:35.800 line:82%
He'll come again.

812
00:41:38.767 --> 00:41:40.967 line:82%
-What?
-My goodness.

813
00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:43.667 line:82%
-What?
-My goodness.

814
00:41:53.767 --> 00:41:57.000 line:82%
-Gosh, shall we watch the videotape?
-Shall we do that?

815
00:41:57.066 --> 00:42:00.500 line:82%
-Come this way.
-I'll lock the door.

816
00:42:10.066 --> 00:42:11.133 line:82%
Turn on the TV.

817
00:42:13.567 --> 00:42:15.367 line:82%
-Here it is.
-
This is the
Nine O'clock News.

818
00:42:15.433 --> 00:42:17.333 line:82%
Here's the next story.

819
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.266 line:82%
Over 150 billion won
was revealed to be stolen through fraud.

820
00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:24.300 line:82%
Due to the biggest case
of fraud in history,

821
00:42:24.367 --> 00:42:26.934 line:82%
42 people were arrested and charged.

822
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.934 line:82%
Due to the biggest case
of fraud in history…

823
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.367 line:82%
-It wasn't a drug case.
-No.

824
00:42:30.433 --> 00:42:31.300 line:82%
Over 150 billion won?

825
00:42:31.867 --> 00:42:33.667 line:82%
Over 38.4 billion won was stolen.

826
00:42:33.734 --> 00:42:35.834 line:82%
Over 1,500 people were involved.

827
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.967 line:82%
It's the biggest fraud operation
uncovered by the police.

828
00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:41.834 line:82%
The accused distributed… in the '90s…

829
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.767 line:82%
…
and turned into a big group
of fraudsters.

830
00:42:44.834 --> 00:42:48.567 line:82%
By combining the amounts on the bankbooks
and other materials,

831
00:42:48.633 --> 00:42:53.633 line:82%
we've found that over 150 billion won
was stolen in the loan fraud.

832
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.467 line:82%
-Is this a real case?
-Over 150 billion won?

833
00:42:57.533 --> 00:43:00.734 line:82%
Many women in their forties and fifties
have gone missing

834
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.100 line:82%
after suffering from the demands
to pay off the debts.

835
00:43:03.166 --> 00:43:07.700 line:82%
It has led to many family troubles.

836
00:43:08.734 --> 00:43:10.400 line:82%
What's shocking is

837
00:43:10.467 --> 00:43:13.800 line:82%
that over 30 high-ranking officials
such as a deputy director,

838
00:43:13.867 --> 00:43:16.333 line:82%
over ten teachers,
over ten bank employees,

839
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.500 line:82%
and other highly educated individuals
have fallen for such antics.

840
00:43:19.567 --> 00:43:22.100 line:82%
It has had
widespread social ramifications.

841
00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.734 line:82%
It has had
widespread social ramifications.

842
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.767 line:82%
-Hold on.
-What?

843
00:43:28.834 --> 00:43:30.266 line:82%
Hey. No way.

844
00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:33.867 line:82%
Perhaps the scattered money
was from fraudulent funds.

845
00:43:34.467 --> 00:43:36.000 line:82%
-It's money.
-This is incredible!

846
00:43:46.266 --> 00:43:47.700 line:82%
My goodness.

847
00:43:58.734 --> 00:44:00.266 line:82%
-Hey.
-What?

848
00:44:01.433 --> 00:44:03.433 line:82%
I noticed something
when we were playing hide-and-seek.

849
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.600 line:82%
That symbol was on a T-shirt too.

850
00:44:05.667 --> 00:44:08.433 line:82%
-It's in every room. The bull.
-It's everywhere.

851
00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:10.433 line:82%
I think it means something.

852
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.233 line:82%
Does it have to do with a drug cartel?

853
00:44:14.967 --> 00:44:17.433 line:82%
-The case is about drugs.
-Yes.

854
00:44:20.633 --> 00:44:22.600 line:82%
How strange.

855
00:44:32.367 --> 00:44:33.433 line:82%
Jae-seok.

856
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.367 line:82%
What is it?

857
00:44:36.433 --> 00:44:38.166 line:82%
-It isn't even hidden.
-What?

858
00:44:38.233 --> 00:44:39.500 line:82%
-It isn't even hidden.
-What?

859
00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:42.800 line:82%
This must be the den.

860
00:44:44.433 --> 00:44:45.467 line:82%
Right? Here.

861
00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.734 line:82%
What does the symbol mean?

862
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.233 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Yes?

863
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.900 line:82%
We should watch the videotape too.

864
00:44:54.467 --> 00:44:57.000 line:82%
-Right.
-Yes.

865
00:44:57.066 --> 00:44:59.400 line:82%
This is a case about drugs.

866
00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:00.900 line:82%
You know…

867
00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:04.600 line:82%
-I'll be honest.
-Okay.

868
00:45:04.667 --> 00:45:06.333 line:82%
-I'm not the spy today.
-Okay.

869
00:45:07.467 --> 00:45:10.000 line:82%
-You?
-So I don't even need to watch it.

870
00:45:10.066 --> 00:45:10.967 line:82%
-Why not?
-Why not?

871
00:45:11.033 --> 00:45:13.667 line:82%
I figured it out
as soon as I entered the other unit.

872
00:45:13.734 --> 00:45:15.834 line:82%
-What did you figure out?
-The hint in the room.

873
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.133 line:82%
-How?
-"Look in the small room in unit 406."

874
00:45:18.734 --> 00:45:21.467 line:82%
LOOK IN THE SMALL ROOM
IN UNIT 406

875
00:45:21.533 --> 00:45:23.266 line:82%
-What was there?
-I saw it.

876
00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:24.667 line:82%
-What did you see?
-What did you see?

877
00:45:25.867 --> 00:45:27.300 line:82%
-What did you see?
-What did you see?

878
00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:31.600 line:82%
-Jae-seok, hello. Welcome.
-Hello.

879
00:45:31.667 --> 00:45:34.133 line:82%
-This room…
-"Will our relationship reach"…

880
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.033 line:82%
Why are there so many things?

881
00:45:44.667 --> 00:45:46.734 line:82%
-You saw the notebook earlier too.
-What?

882
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.300 line:82%
Some sentences were underlined.

883
00:45:49.367 --> 00:45:51.700 line:82%
-Yes, they were.
-They were underlined.

884
00:45:51.767 --> 00:45:53.133 line:82%
What were those sentences?

885
00:45:55.533 --> 00:45:56.600 line:82%
What?

886
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.266 line:82%
What?

887
00:46:00.934 --> 00:46:02.133 line:82%
Hold on.

888
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.033 line:82%
Right?

889
00:46:16.467 --> 00:46:18.133 line:82%
-Hold on.
-What?

890
00:46:21.533 --> 00:46:23.100 line:82%
Jae-seok, where are you going?

891
00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:26.266 line:82%
-Is he a spy?
-Your guess is spot on.

892
00:46:26.333 --> 00:46:28.066 line:82%
-I don't know. He just left.
-Is he a spy?

893
00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:30.100 line:82%
-He went without a word.
-He's a spy.

894
00:46:30.166 --> 00:46:31.600 line:82%
He's a spy.

895
00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:34.433 line:82%
-Tae-hyun.
-Where is he suddenly going?

896
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.533 line:82%
Where is he going?

897
00:46:37.467 --> 00:46:39.834 line:82%
Where did Jae-seok go?

898
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.467 line:82%
-Get out.
-I can't believe you.

899
00:46:44.533 --> 00:46:46.266 line:82%
-You just casually came in.
-Jae-seok.

900
00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:48.200 line:82%
Get out. Let us eat in peace.

901
00:46:48.266 --> 00:46:50.066 line:82%
No, Na-ra. Come here. Go and eat.

902
00:46:50.133 --> 00:46:51.333 line:82%
-Let me take a peek.
-No.

903
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.133 line:82%
-Go and eat.
-Is there something?

904
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.000 line:82%
-Go and eat first.
-Okay.

905
00:46:55.066 --> 00:46:56.367 line:82%
Go and eat first.

906
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.133 line:82%
-JENNIE, pork cutlet.
-Na-ra.

907
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.233 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

908
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:09.000 line:82%
-Na-ra, I had a good meal.
-Come on. Doesn't it look tasty?

909
00:47:09.066 --> 00:47:11.800 line:82%
-JENNIE. Hold on.
-Na-ra. Oh, no.

910
00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:13.633 line:82%
-Don't you want to eat it?
-No.

911
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.033 line:82%
-Get out.
-I know you want it.

912
00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.233 line:82%

-Bong-seok.

913
00:47:19.533 --> 00:47:22.467 line:82%
-Why are you so strong?
-You're too strong.

914
00:47:22.533 --> 00:47:24.800 line:82%
Na-ra, have you been working out?

915
00:47:26.934 --> 00:47:29.667 line:82%
I can't drag her out. I really can't.

916
00:47:30.233 --> 00:47:32.867 line:82%
-Na-ra, come on.
-Have a bite.

917
00:47:32.934 --> 00:47:34.934 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Have a bite.

918
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.834 line:82%
Take your time. Go and eat first.

919
00:47:38.667 --> 00:47:40.600 line:82%
-Come here. Open wide.
-Na-ra is so strong.

920
00:47:40.667 --> 00:47:43.066 line:82%
-There you go. Open wide.
-Seriously.

921
00:47:43.133 --> 00:47:45.767 line:82%
Come here. Open wide.

922
00:47:45.834 --> 00:47:46.667 line:82%
There you go.

923
00:47:46.734 --> 00:47:47.834 line:82%
Open wide.

924
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.233 line:82%
-Aren't you going to give it to me?
-Eat it.

925
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.667 line:82%
Eat it.

926
00:47:51.734 --> 00:47:53.700 line:82%
Bong-seok fell for the pork cutlet.

927
00:48:14.967 --> 00:48:16.600 line:82%
Tae-hyun was right.

928
00:48:18.567 --> 00:48:22.133 line:82%
Some sentences were underlined.
What were those sentences?

929
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.533 line:82%
OUR RELATIONSHIP

930
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.934 line:82%
Something about a relationship.

931
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.867 line:82%
That's right. "Relationship."

932
00:48:27.934 --> 00:48:33.400 line:82%
-On the wall was the times table.
-The times table.

933
00:48:33.467 --> 00:48:36.200 line:82%
-
Some parts were circled.
-
Really?

934
00:48:36.266 --> 00:48:37.300 line:82%
Go and look.

935
00:48:37.367 --> 00:48:40.834 line:82%
-And there were
hwatu
cards, right?
-Yes.

936
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.433 line:82%
I don't know the corresponding numbers.

937
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.333 line:82%
The blue ribbon cards were in a pair.
If I excluded them,

938
00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.567 line:82%
one of the cards depicted the rain.

939
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.633 line:82%
-
The
hwatu cards have two birds, right?
-
Yes.

940
00:48:56.967 --> 00:48:59.633 line:82%
-Four, two.
-What?

941
00:49:01.667 --> 00:49:03.767 line:82%
-Four, two. What's next?
-Four, two.

942
00:49:03.834 --> 00:49:05.100 line:82%
Hold on.

943
00:49:05.166 --> 00:49:07.633 line:82%
-What is it? Four, two.
-What did I say earlier?

944
00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.934 line:82%
-Rain.
-My goodness.

945
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.867 line:82%
-There was the rain card.
-Yes.

946
00:49:12.934 --> 00:49:14.734 line:82%
-The words make up "Cult."
-Cult.

947
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.800 line:82%
That's right.

948
00:49:15.867 --> 00:49:18.800 line:82%
-Is that the symbol of a cult?
-The symbol.

949
00:49:18.867 --> 00:49:20.567 line:82%
We could hide the clues.

950
00:49:20.633 --> 00:49:23.133 line:82%
But there's no point in hiding them.

951
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.433 line:82%
-They'll figure it out.
-They need to know.

952
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.000 line:82%
They didn't look, did they?
We can't rip it up.

953
00:49:31.834 --> 00:49:34.600 line:82%
-Four, two, and B.
-Eight.

954
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.900 line:82%
-Four, two, and B. What could B be?
-Eight.

955
00:49:43.433 --> 00:49:45.066 line:82%
Come here. It's incredible.

956
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.166 line:82%
Look. Four and two.

957
00:49:48.233 --> 00:49:50.934 line:82%
What if this isn't eight, but B?

958
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.467 line:82%
-Together, they make up "Cult."
-Cult.

959
00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:55.967 line:82%
JENNIE.

960
00:49:58.166 --> 00:50:00.200 line:82%
-"PSY" and "Rain" make up the word too.
-Yes.

961
00:50:00.266 --> 00:50:02.533 line:82%
-We're good.
-We figured it out.

962
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.200 line:82%
A religious organization
used talk of doomsday

963
00:50:20.266 --> 00:50:24.200 line:82%
and extorted over 38 billion won
from its followers.

964
00:50:24.266 --> 00:50:27.667 line:82%
Over 150 billion won
was stolen in the loan fraud.

965
00:50:31.333 --> 00:50:36.500 line:82%
Then on this earth,
you'll see an immense sword.

966
00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:38.166 line:82%
What's shocking is

967
00:50:38.233 --> 00:50:41.567 line:82%
that over 30 high-ranking officials
such as a deputy director,

968
00:50:41.633 --> 00:50:44.100 line:82%
over ten teachers,
over ten bank employees,

969
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:47.133 line:82%
and other highly educated individuals
have fallen for such antics.

970
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.400 line:82%
"When the end of the world comes,
you don't have to repay the loan."

971
00:50:50.467 --> 00:50:52.533 line:82%
By making the believers stand surety,

972
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.934 line:82%
the cult leader took out
a loan of 30 billion won.

973
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.900 line:82%
I realized I had been fooled.

974
00:50:56.967 --> 00:51:01.100 line:82%
I was so disappointed and devastated
that I tried to commit suicide.

975
00:51:01.166 --> 00:51:02.967 line:82%
But the cult leader and the spouse

976
00:51:03.033 --> 00:51:06.266 line:82%
led a luxurious lifestyle
with the believers' money.

977
00:51:15.266 --> 00:51:16.967 line:82%
-Na-ra, hurry up.
-I'm here.

978
00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:20.033 line:82%
…and other highly educated individuals
have fallen for such antics.

979
00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.400 line:82%
It has had
widespread social ramifications.

980
00:51:22.467 --> 00:51:25.533 line:82%
Meanwhile, the mastermind
of the biggest fraud in the 20th century,

981
00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.967 line:82%
-
"A", ran away from the police.
-"A".

982
00:51:29.033 --> 00:51:32.734 line:82%
Meanwhile, the mastermind
of the biggest fraud in the 20th century,

983
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.600 line:82%
"A", ran away from the police.

984
00:51:34.667 --> 00:51:37.400 line:82%
"A's" whereabouts are unknown.

985
00:51:37.467 --> 00:51:39.834 line:82%
We await the civilians' tips.

986
00:51:40.567 --> 00:51:42.166 line:82%
We await the civilians' tips.

987
00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:43.533 line:82%
-Look.
-What?

988
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.300 line:82%
"A" is the spy.

989
00:51:48.367 --> 00:51:49.667 line:82%
Is there a spy?

990
00:51:49.734 --> 00:51:53.467 line:82%
-That means there is a spy.
-Of course.

991
00:52:01.934 --> 00:52:05.500 line:82%
-"Has excellent interpersonal skills."
-"Has excellent interpersonal skills."

992
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.834 line:82%
"Has excellent interpersonal skills."

993
00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:11.867 line:82%
No?

994
00:52:11.934 --> 00:52:14.033 line:82%
-I don't know.
-I saw the notebook too.

995
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.400 line:82%
In any case-- Really?

996
00:52:15.467 --> 00:52:17.100 line:82%
Yes, I saw the notebook too.

997
00:52:18.734 --> 00:52:20.000 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-Yes?

998
00:52:20.066 --> 00:52:23.266 line:82%
It's him. Leave him be for three hours.

999
00:52:23.333 --> 00:52:25.633 line:82%
It says here that "A"
has excellent interpersonal skills.

1000
00:52:26.567 --> 00:52:27.834 line:82%
It's Jae-seok.

1001
00:52:29.233 --> 00:52:30.467 line:82%
It's Jae-seok.

1002
00:52:31.867 --> 00:52:33.934 line:82%
-Excellent interpersonal skills.
-Gosh.

1003
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.333 line:82%
-He drives me crazy.
-That's all we need to know.

1004
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.467 line:82%
Na-ra.

1005
00:52:37.533 --> 00:52:39.734 line:82%
I can't believe him.

1006
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.767 line:82%
Just watch.

1007
00:52:40.834 --> 00:52:43.200 line:82%
Why would you say that in front of me?

1008
00:52:43.266 --> 00:52:45.066 line:82%
I can't believe you.

1009
00:52:45.133 --> 00:52:48.533 line:82%
-Let's feign ignorance for three hours.
-We don't know anything.

1010
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.133 line:82%
-All right.
-For goodness' sake.

1011
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.500 line:82%
Who do you suspect?

1012
00:52:57.567 --> 00:52:58.633 line:82%
-Who do I suspect?
-Yes.

1013
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:02.567 line:82%
Firstly, I suspect Jae-seok.

1014
00:53:03.834 --> 00:53:06.000 line:82%
It's suspicious that he showed up late.

1015
00:53:07.433 --> 00:53:09.734 line:82%
-Perhaps he did something beforehand.
-Yes.

1016
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.667 line:82%
Perhaps he received a mission beforehand.

1017
00:53:11.734 --> 00:53:14.600 line:82%
-That's right.
-However, he's too simple-minded.

1018
00:53:14.667 --> 00:53:15.934 line:82%
How about you, JENNIE?

1019
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.200 line:82%
-As for me…
-Okay.

1020
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.200 line:82%
Jae-seok.

1021
00:53:21.867 --> 00:53:24.734 line:82%
-
I don't know if I can trust him.
-
I know.

1022
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.166 line:82%
-On that team, the spy is Jae-seok.
-Yes.

1023
00:53:27.233 --> 00:53:29.834 line:82%
On this team,
I'm a bit suspicious of JENNIE.

1024
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.600 line:82%
Your outfit looks similar to the symbol.

1025
00:53:33.667 --> 00:53:37.300 line:82%
Isn't that right?
A white symbol against a dark background.

1026
00:53:37.367 --> 00:53:39.767 line:82%
-No.
-It's too simple, right?

1027
00:53:39.834 --> 00:53:42.567 line:82%
Se-chan, the shape of your mustache
resembles the symbol.

1028
00:53:42.633 --> 00:53:45.367 line:82%
-It looks like the bull.
-No way.

1029
00:53:45.433 --> 00:53:48.133 line:82%
If you see the symbol upside down,
it becomes a mustache.

1030
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.467 line:82%
-I see the resemblance.
-Don't be absurd.

1031
00:53:51.533 --> 00:53:54.233 line:82%
If we suspect each other,
our feelings will get hurt.

1032
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.567 line:82%
Let's not suspect things like
earrings and makeup.

1033
00:53:58.133 --> 00:54:01.433 line:82%
Wouldn't "A" have a tattoo
on his or her body?

1034
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.834 line:82%
It really isn't me.

1035
00:54:04.734 --> 00:54:07.433 line:82%
-Wait. You aren't taking off your clothes.
-I'm sweating.

1036
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.934 line:82%
-You stopped there.
-You stopped there.

1037
00:54:11.233 --> 00:54:12.800 line:82%
You're out of your mind.

1038
00:54:12.867 --> 00:54:14.900 line:82%
-Let's go outside. Be careful, JENNIE.
-Okay?

1039
00:54:15.934 --> 00:54:19.400 line:82%
All of you are crazy.

1040
00:54:19.467 --> 00:54:20.500 line:82%
Let's go out.

1041
00:54:22.934 --> 00:54:24.166 line:82%
Okay?

1042
00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.567 line:82%
None of you are in your right mind.

1043
00:54:31.734 --> 00:54:34.934 line:82%
None of you are in your right mind.

1044
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.066 line:82%
Se-chan.

1045
00:54:36.867 --> 00:54:40.467 line:82%
All of you should be ruined!

1046
00:54:45.467 --> 00:54:46.867 line:82%
All of you are insane.

1047
00:54:46.934 --> 00:54:49.500 line:82%
-You're doing this again. Come here.
-Let go of me.

1048
00:54:49.567 --> 00:54:53.033 line:82%
Why are you behaving this way here?
Let's go.

1049
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.600 line:82%
-Let go of me.
-We're sorry. We'll take him with us.

1050
00:54:55.667 --> 00:54:56.600 line:82%
-Let go.
-Come on.

1051
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.633 line:82%
-Isn't he the resident representative?
-Yes.

1052
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.233 line:82%
Wasn't he making dalgona earlier?

1053
00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.600 line:82%
Why did he cause a ruckus here?

1054
00:55:08.667 --> 00:55:10.400 line:82%
Why did he say people are insane?

1055
00:55:10.467 --> 00:55:12.000 line:82%
Who knows?

1056
00:55:12.066 --> 00:55:14.033 line:82%
Is he the druggie from earlier?

1057
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.567 line:82%
Your acting was awkward.

1058
00:55:15.633 --> 00:55:18.467 line:82%
-Your tone was suspicious.
-Come on.

1059
00:55:18.533 --> 00:55:19.500 line:82%
We're veterans.

1060
00:55:19.567 --> 00:55:22.433 line:82%
-Your tone was suspicious.
-Come on.

1061
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.400 line:82%
We're veterans.

1062
00:55:23.467 --> 00:55:25.400 line:82%
We promised to feign ignorance
for three hours.

1063
00:55:25.467 --> 00:55:27.734 line:82%
-I--
-Act like you don't know.

1064
00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.100 line:82%
Why is your nose runny?

1065
00:55:31.166 --> 00:55:34.066 line:82%
-Why is your nose runny?
-Tae-hyun thinks it's me.

1066
00:55:34.133 --> 00:55:37.000 line:82%
-You're stressed out.
-I'm so stressed out.

1067
00:55:44.066 --> 00:55:46.367 line:82%
-Did you find anything?
-You startled me.

1068
00:55:46.433 --> 00:55:48.767 line:82%
-Did you find anything?
-We were eating pork cutlets.

1069
00:55:48.834 --> 00:55:49.900 line:82%
We're going to eat first.

1070
00:55:49.967 --> 00:55:52.066 line:82%
There's nothing. It's meaningless.

1071
00:55:52.633 --> 00:55:55.300 line:82%
-So you searched the place. You did.
-What?

1072
00:55:55.367 --> 00:55:57.166 line:82%
-No, there's nothing.
-Is there something?

1073
00:55:57.233 --> 00:56:01.200 line:82%
Na-ra, the millennial and Gen Zers
want to have a private meeting.

1074
00:56:01.266 --> 00:56:06.133 line:82%
I'm sorry, but the DMZ needs to leave.

1075
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.300 line:82%
Let us have a private meeting.
DMZ, please leave.

1076
00:56:08.367 --> 00:56:10.433 line:82%
You can throw that grenade over there.

1077
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.400 line:82%
-Hurry up.
-Bang, bang.

1078
00:56:12.467 --> 00:56:13.600 line:82%
Please leave.

1079
00:56:13.667 --> 00:56:16.400 line:82%
The millennial and Gen Zers
will have a meeting.

1080
00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.633 line:82%
I can't believe he called me DMZ.

1081
00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.533 line:82%
-I got goosebumps.
-Why?

1082
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.767 line:82%
-I think Na-ra is the spy.
-Why?

1083
00:56:26.834 --> 00:56:30.500 line:82%
Na-ra always tells me,
"Jung-ha, let's do this together."

1084
00:56:30.567 --> 00:56:32.433 line:82%
But she hasn't said it once to me today.

1085
00:56:33.133 --> 00:56:36.567 line:82%
-I forgot about that.
-There's this.

1086
00:56:36.633 --> 00:56:40.400 line:82%
Earlier, I was surprised by her strength.

1087
00:56:42.633 --> 00:56:45.367 line:82%
I can't drag her out. I really can't.

1088
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000 line:82%
Na-ra.

1089
00:56:48.066 --> 00:56:51.066 line:82%
-My arm almost got pulled out.
-Right?

1090
00:56:51.133 --> 00:56:53.333 line:82%
-She's never done that before.
-She never used her strength.

1091
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.900 line:82%
Right. That was the first time.

1092
00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.533 line:82%
They keep coming to our unit.
We should go to them.

1093
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.133 line:82%
Let's go and get some pork cutlets.

1094
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.633 line:82%
-That's right.
-Pork cutlets.

1095
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:06.600 line:82%
Pork cutlets.

1096
00:57:06.667 --> 00:57:10.300 line:82%
-They're eating quietly by themselves.
-Let's go and eat pork cutlets.

1097
00:57:10.367 --> 00:57:12.900 line:82%
Someone took my shoe.

1098
00:57:13.533 --> 00:57:15.066 line:82%
Where did your shoe go?

1099
00:57:15.133 --> 00:57:17.400 line:82%
I don't know. Someone stole it.

1100
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.700 line:82%
The spy.

1101
00:57:19.767 --> 00:57:21.767 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-What?

1102
00:57:21.834 --> 00:57:23.800 line:82%
-Where did they go?
-Where did they go?

1103
00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:27.133 line:82%
What? Are they hiding again?

1104
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.934 line:82%
-Stop it already.
-I don't want to look for them.

1105
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.266 line:82%
-Where did they go?
-Seriously.

1106
00:57:32.333 --> 00:57:33.333 line:82%
Where did they go?

1107
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.800 line:82%
The pork cutlets look delicious.

1108
00:57:34.867 --> 00:57:36.800 line:82%
I guess they received a hint
and went somewhere.

1109
00:57:39.533 --> 00:57:42.266 line:82%
-Is it the sixth floor?
-Yes, it's unit 613.

1110
00:57:42.333 --> 00:57:43.600 line:82%
Okay.

1111
00:57:43.667 --> 00:57:47.233 line:82%
I'm sharing this for you guys.

1112
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:50.100 line:82%
-It's something you ought to do.
-We're a team.

1113
00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:52.200 line:82%
It was delivered to the three of us.

1114
00:57:52.266 --> 00:57:55.000 line:82%
You guys almost lost the key to me.

1115
00:57:55.066 --> 00:57:56.967 line:82%
I won't give things to you from now on.

1116
00:57:57.033 --> 00:57:58.433 line:82%
Don't be absurd. It's up to me.

1117
00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.600 line:82%
-Is this the floor?
-Everyone, come to unit 613.

1118
00:58:10.367 --> 00:58:11.533 line:82%
Unit 613.

1119
00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:13.767 line:82%
There it is.

1120
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.900 line:82%
-See? It's open.
-You're right.

1121
00:58:18.967 --> 00:58:20.400 line:82%
It wasn't before. Open it.

1122
00:58:20.467 --> 00:58:21.767 line:82%
-I'm scared.
-I'm scared.

1123
00:58:22.333 --> 00:58:24.767 line:82%
-Hey! You sons of bitches!
-What?

1124
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:27.433 line:82%
All of you should be ruined!

1125
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.333 line:82%
Let go of me.

1126
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.800 line:82%
Why are you behaving this way here?

1127
00:58:29.867 --> 00:58:33.066 line:82%
-Let's go.
-We're sorry.

1128
00:58:42.033 --> 00:58:44.533 line:82%
It's open.

1129
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.000 line:82%
It's open.

1130
00:58:47.066 --> 00:58:48.100 line:82%
What?

1131
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.133 line:82%
All right.

1132
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.200 line:82%
This is the cult leader, "A's"--

1133
00:59:23.266 --> 00:59:25.033 line:82%
Hey. "Missing person."

1134
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.166 line:82%
MISSING PERSON

1135
00:59:33.934 --> 00:59:35.934 line:82%
She went missing
after she left for school.

1136
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.600 line:82%
WENT MISSING
AFTER LEAVING FOR SCHOOL

1137
00:59:38.667 --> 00:59:39.934 line:82%
It's a woman.

1138
00:59:43.467 --> 00:59:44.900 line:82%
Was there a videotape?

1139
00:59:44.967 --> 00:59:47.533 line:82%
-You're good at finding things.
-Turn on the TV.

1140
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.600 line:82%
It was here.

1141
00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.400 line:82%
Play.

1142
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.633 line:82%
-Play.
-
The year 1999.

1143
01:00:09.266 --> 01:00:11.934 line:82%
The year 1999.

1144
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.967 line:82%
-
The apocalypse is coming.
-We guessed correctly.

1145
01:00:15.033 --> 01:00:16.600 line:82%
That's right.

1146
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.100 line:82%
At the end of the world,
one thing will save us.

1147
01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:22.433 line:82%
I see the symbol.
The resident representative?

1148
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.734 line:82%
And that is sincere faith.

1149
01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.533 line:82%
-It's a cult.
-She was the tteokbokki vendor.

1150
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.100 line:82%
That's right. All the residents
we saw earlier are there.

1151
01:00:30.967 --> 01:00:34.000 line:82%
The sanctuary we have built with faith

1152
01:00:34.066 --> 01:00:37.333 line:82%
and the base for our afterlife,
Woosang Apartment.

1153
01:00:38.367 --> 01:00:40.033 line:82%
-This is the den.
-
When the apocalypse comes

1154
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.266 line:82%
in the new millennium,

1155
01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:45.333 line:82%
-
the residents will be saved.
-We saw them earlier.

1156
01:00:46.033 --> 01:00:50.600 line:82%
Give your worldly greed and fortunes
to the savior

1157
01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:53.233 line:82%
and show your faith.

1158
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.734 line:82%
Believe.

1159
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.767 line:82%
Only those who believe will be saved.

1160
01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:02.500 line:82%
-We believe in you.
-We believe in you.

1161
01:01:03.066 --> 01:01:05.767 line:82%
There was the creator
at the beginning of time.

1162
01:01:05.834 --> 01:01:08.900 line:82%
I'm the incarnation of the creator.

1163
01:01:08.967 --> 01:01:11.133 line:82%
I'll save you.

1164
01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:16.033 line:82%
Praise Daehan Woosang Cult
Jinrihoe Church.

1165
01:01:17.567 --> 01:01:20.467 line:82%
DAEHAN WOOSANG CULT
JINRIHOE CHURCH

1166
01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:28.533 line:82%
I got goosebumps.

1167
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.066 line:82%
All the residents are cult followers.

1168
01:01:31.867 --> 01:01:33.700 line:82%
-Woosang.
-Woosang Apartment.

1169
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.000 line:82%
The entire apartment
is a stronghold of cult followers.

1170
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.934 line:82%
The cult leader and the spouse
claimed that a sanctuary must be built

1171
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.867 line:82%
to survive the apocalypse

1172
01:01:46.934 --> 01:01:48.700 line:82%
and forced the followers to pay
large offerings.

1173
01:01:49.266 --> 01:01:50.867 line:82%
On a 300,000 square meter property,

1174
01:01:50.934 --> 01:01:54.367 line:82%
they even built an apartment
for the followers.

1175
01:02:06.133 --> 01:02:08.934 line:82%
What does that make
the owner of this unit?

1176
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.467 line:82%
Hold on. Let's look around the place.

1177
01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:16.667 line:82%
Jae-seok, she must be that man's daughter.

1178
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.867 line:82%
Right. I bet she got dragged to a cult.
Right?

1179
01:02:23.533 --> 01:02:25.900 line:82%
The liquor bottles tell me

1180
01:02:25.967 --> 01:02:28.233 line:82%
-that this is the man's room.
-Yes.

1181
01:02:34.367 --> 01:02:36.700 line:82%
He drank a lot. He must've been tormented.

1182
01:02:36.767 --> 01:02:39.500 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-Gosh, you startled me.

1183
01:02:39.567 --> 01:02:41.567 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-You startled me.

1184
01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.300 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-Gosh, you startled me.

1185
01:02:44.367 --> 01:02:45.367 line:82%
You startled me.

1186
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.700 line:82%
-Hey! You startled me.
-You practically jumped.

1187
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:51.867 line:82%
I'm disappointed.

1188
01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.633 line:82%
-We thought you were eating.
-I know.

1189
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.867 line:82%
You startled me.

1190
01:02:54.934 --> 01:02:58.500 line:82%
-It's that man's house.
-Right. It's that man's house.

1191
01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:00.433 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1192
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.700 line:82%
You startled me.

1193
01:03:01.767 --> 01:03:03.734 line:82%
-Here.
-She's missing.

1194
01:03:06.266 --> 01:03:07.333 line:82%
What is it?

1195
01:03:08.734 --> 01:03:10.633 line:82%
-Right?
-Leave them be.

1196
01:03:13.033 --> 01:03:16.100 line:82%
They're still searching the place.

1197
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.066 line:82%
-Jae-seok.
-There's nothing.

1198
01:03:21.133 --> 01:03:22.967 line:82%
We're searching too.

1199
01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:35.400 line:82%
Why am I on this bottle?

1200
01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.533 line:82%
Look at this.

1201
01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.400 line:82%
-It wasn't there.
-No?

1202
01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:46.467 line:82%
The tape.

1203
01:03:49.767 --> 01:03:51.100 line:82%
What is it?

1204
01:03:51.166 --> 01:03:54.200 line:82%
-Hold on.
-What?

1205
01:03:54.266 --> 01:03:55.700 line:82%
Gather around.

1206
01:03:55.767 --> 01:03:58.000 line:82%
-Guys.
-It's Jae-seok.

1207
01:03:58.066 --> 01:04:00.633 line:82%
-He has something.
-You're it if you keep quiet.

1208
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.233 line:82%
-Tae-hyun, he's it if he doesn't share.
-Guys, he has a Book of Prophecies.

1209
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.834 line:82%
-What?
-Let's circle him.

1210
01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.667 line:82%
It isn't like that. I just found it.

1211
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.000 line:82%
You startled me.

1212
01:04:19.033 --> 01:04:20.767 line:82%
You startled me.

1213
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.500 line:82%
BOOK OF PROPHECIES

1214
01:04:26.567 --> 01:04:30.133 line:82%
It seems like you went through the book.
Isn't that right?

1215
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.400 line:82%
-Then you found a crucial clue.
-A crucial clue.

1216
01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:36.567 line:82%
-A crucial clue. Let's see it.
-We found it.

1217
01:04:36.633 --> 01:04:40.100 line:82%
-What is it?
-I just realized something.

1218
01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:43.300 line:82%
Someone is carrying out these things.

1219
01:04:43.367 --> 01:04:44.667 line:82%
-A mission?
-A mission.

1220
01:04:44.734 --> 01:04:46.300 line:82%
-Is there a mission?
-Let's see.

1221
01:04:46.367 --> 01:04:47.200 line:82%
Jae-seok, this is…

1222
01:04:47.266 --> 01:04:49.066 line:82%
-What is it?
-JENNIE.

1223
01:04:49.133 --> 01:04:50.667 line:82%
-I got goosebumps.
-Hold on.

1224
01:04:50.734 --> 01:04:52.400 line:82%
What did it say? Hold on.

1225
01:04:52.467 --> 01:04:54.500 line:82%
-Hold on.
-Wait.

1226
01:04:58.166 --> 01:05:01.166 line:82%
Some items are crossed out.
It means they've been completed.

1227
01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.967 line:82%
-"Jae-seok will hug Jung-ha."
-"…hug Jung-ha."

1228
01:05:05.033 --> 01:05:06.767 line:82%
-"Tae-hyun will cry."
-"…cry."

1229
01:05:06.834 --> 01:05:08.500 line:82%
-"Se-chan will lose a shoe."
-I did.

1230
01:05:08.567 --> 01:05:10.266 line:82%
-You lost a shoe.
-Where is it?

1231
01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:11.800 line:82%
Where did your shoes go?

1232
01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:14.400 line:82%
I don't know. Someone stole them.

1233
01:05:14.467 --> 01:05:16.500 line:82%
-"Na-ra will snap a group photo."
-"…a group photo."

1234
01:05:16.567 --> 01:05:17.834 line:82%
"JENNIE will dance."

1235
01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.400 line:82%
-"Jung-ha will get stains on his clothes."
-"…stains on his clothes."

1236
01:05:21.467 --> 01:05:23.967 line:82%
-Some items are crossed out.
-Hey, his clothes are stained.

1237
01:05:24.033 --> 01:05:25.667 line:82%
-Come here. What's that?
-Where?

1238
01:05:25.734 --> 01:05:27.166 line:82%
When did it happen?

1239
01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:29.834 line:82%
-Someone did it.
-Hey.

1240
01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:31.500 line:82%
"Once all the predictions come true,

1241
01:05:31.567 --> 01:05:33.867 line:82%
the day the cult leader talked about
will come."

1242
01:05:33.934 --> 01:05:35.166 line:82%
I got chills.

1243
01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.200 line:82%
-Nonsense.
-I know.

1244
01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:40.066 line:82%
-Na-ra, what's yours?
-A group photo.

1245
01:05:40.133 --> 01:05:42.367 line:82%
-A group photo.
-I haven't taken it yet.

1246
01:05:42.433 --> 01:05:46.400 line:82%
It's someone who knows our habits well.

1247
01:05:46.467 --> 01:05:49.367 line:82%
I always take group photos.

1248
01:05:49.433 --> 01:05:52.934 line:82%
Three seconds. One, two, three.

1249
01:05:56.533 --> 01:05:59.467 line:82%
JENNIE is someone who dances a lot.

1250
01:05:59.533 --> 01:06:00.600 line:82%
That's right.

1251
01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:04.867 line:82%
L-O-V-E-L-E-E

1252
01:06:08.667 --> 01:06:10.567 line:82%
It's someone who knows our habits well.

1253
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.066 line:82%
I don't lose my shoes every day.

1254
01:06:14.133 --> 01:06:16.000 line:82%
I don't stain my clothes every day.

1255
01:06:16.066 --> 01:06:18.133 line:82%
-Jae-seok hugs the members after filming.
-Right.

1256
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.467 line:82%
1. JAE-SEOK WILL HUG JUNG-HA

1257
01:06:19.533 --> 01:06:21.100 line:82%
-He doesn't do it suddenly.
-No.

1258
01:06:21.166 --> 01:06:24.166 line:82%
While Tae-hyun cries a lot,
he doesn't cry while he's sober.

1259
01:06:24.233 --> 01:06:25.367 line:82%
-So I'm the problem, right?
-Yes.

1260
01:06:25.433 --> 01:06:26.900 line:82%
2. TAE-HYUN WILL CRY

1261
01:06:26.967 --> 01:06:29.867 line:82%
-What's yours?
-How will you make me cry?

1262
01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:33.233 line:82%
How will you make me cry?

1263
01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.700 line:82%
You're the spy.
You know that you won't cry.

1264
01:06:35.767 --> 01:06:37.433 line:82%
-Maybe he'll cry when he's alone.
-Right.

1265
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.066 line:82%
We can't complete these missions perfectly

1266
01:06:41.133 --> 01:06:43.533 line:82%
-without Tae-hyun.
-That's right.

1267
01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.433 line:82%
Let's say
all the other missions get completed.

1268
01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.166 line:82%
-Suddenly, Tae-hyun cries.
-That's right.

1269
01:06:51.233 --> 01:06:52.700 line:82%
-Gosh, I need that role.
-Tae-hyun.

1270
01:06:52.767 --> 01:06:56.033 line:82%
-You'll be the main character.
-It would be so cool.

1271
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.200 line:82%
-Gosh, I need that role.
-Tae-hyun.

1272
01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.600 line:82%
You'll be the main character.

1273
01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:06.633 line:82%
-Seriously.
-Tae-hyun, I told you.

1274
01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.400 line:82%
Objectively speaking,

1275
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:14.200 line:82%
the only member who can complete
all of these missions perfectly

1276
01:07:14.266 --> 01:07:15.500 line:82%
is you.

1277
01:07:15.567 --> 01:07:17.333 line:82%
Do you want me to cry?

1278
01:07:19.767 --> 01:07:23.834 line:82%
-For goodness' sake.
-I think it depends on me.

1279
01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.133 line:82%
Do you want me to cry?

1280
01:07:30.633 --> 01:07:33.133 line:82%
Jae-seok, you're in the palm of his hand.

1281
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.300 line:82%
Tae-hyun is toying with Jae-seok.

1282
01:07:35.367 --> 01:07:38.934 line:82%
-He loosens and tightens his grip.
-I can't believe him.

1283
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.633 line:82%
-
I have an announcement.
-It's an announcement.

1284
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.266 line:82%
An emergency resident meeting
will take place.

1285
01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:56.800 line:82%
I ask that every resident come

1286
01:07:56.867 --> 01:08:00.266 line:82%
to the Senior Center.

1287
01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:01.900 line:82%
-Okay.
-All right.

1288
01:08:01.967 --> 01:08:03.033 line:82%
Okay.

1289
01:08:05.834 --> 01:08:07.767 line:82%
My goodness.

1290
01:08:14.633 --> 01:08:15.967 line:82%
What?

1291
01:08:17.066 --> 01:08:19.567 line:82%
What? What's this?

1292
01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:22.900 line:82%
Why are these symbols everywhere?

1293
01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.667 line:82%
I'm scared.

1294
01:08:44.266 --> 01:08:45.233 line:82%
The floor too.

1295
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.633 line:82%
-Is this our unit?
-So suddenly.

1296
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.900 line:82%
Where did these symbols come from?

1297
01:08:48.967 --> 01:08:50.033 line:82%
What's going on?

1298
01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:01.934 line:82%
Jae-seok, I'm still watching you.

1299
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.433 line:82%
I'm still watching you too.

1300
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.600 line:82%
Why are you and Jung-ha whispering
so much today?

1301
01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:10.233 line:82%
Here's what I think.

1302
01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.667 line:82%
Had I been on your team,
I would've seen right through your lies.

1303
01:09:13.734 --> 01:09:16.233 line:82%
That must be why
the production crew separated us.

1304
01:09:17.333 --> 01:09:18.567 line:82%
-Sharp, right?
-Last week,

1305
01:09:18.633 --> 01:09:20.166 line:82%
I became very flustered

1306
01:09:20.233 --> 01:09:23.767 line:82%
when you said that you were from Bundang.

1307
01:09:23.834 --> 01:09:26.033 line:82%
So I'm keeping an eye on you today.

1308
01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.600 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

1309
01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:29.467 line:82%
-I like it.
-And today…

1310
01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:33.433 line:82%
-Why did you bring that?
-You look cool.

1311
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.867 line:82%
You look cool.

1312
01:09:37.266 --> 01:09:40.400 line:82%
-I don't look half bad.
-It's a nice photo. I like it.

1313
01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:42.100 line:82%
-I don't look half bad.
-Doesn't he look cool?

1314
01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:45.100 line:82%
Na-ra, why are you carrying
that photo so suddenly?

1315
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.266 line:82%
-Are you carrying the cult leader's photo?
-Right now,

1316
01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:49.834 line:82%
Na-ra is under suspicion.

1317
01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.633 line:82%
-That came out of nowhere.
-Yes, the public sentiment is bad.

1318
01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:56.100 line:82%
The public sentiment about you is bad.

1319
01:09:57.233 --> 01:10:01.166 line:82%
Am I being ostracized?
I don't know anything.

1320
01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.133 line:82%
-It isn't you, is it?
-It really isn't me.

1321
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.734 line:82%
It really isn't me.

1322
01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.500 line:82%
I'm a terrible liar.

1323
01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:09.767 line:82%
No way.

1324
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.433 line:82%
I thought you were a terrible liar.

1325
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.400 line:82%
-Did I do well last week?
-Yes.

1326
01:10:15.033 --> 01:10:17.233 line:82%
Jae-seok was hiding, so it wasn't him.

1327
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.800 line:82%
-Tae-hyun…
-Hey.

1328
01:10:18.867 --> 01:10:21.000 line:82%
-A cult leader…
-Okay.

1329
01:10:21.066 --> 01:10:23.333 line:82%
…would naturally have an underling.

1330
01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.800 line:82%
Gosh, I don't know
what to do with that punk.

1331
01:10:26.467 --> 01:10:29.400 line:82%
He tires me out so much.

1332
01:10:29.467 --> 01:10:33.266 line:82%
You shouldn't narrow things down already.

1333
01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:34.967 line:82%
-I should keep things open.
-Yes.

1334
01:10:35.033 --> 01:10:37.200 line:82%
-Like pruning.
-We're a duo.

1335
01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.100 line:82%
A duo.

1336
01:10:38.166 --> 01:10:40.300 line:82%
-In another mission--
-What?

1337
01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:42.767 line:82%
-What?
-Which game will it be?

1338
01:10:42.834 --> 01:10:43.900 line:82%
Hold on.

1339
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.467 line:82%
What?

1340
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.233 line:82%
Hold on.

1341
01:10:54.433 --> 01:10:55.633 line:82%
Hold on.

1342
01:10:58.166 --> 01:10:59.633 line:82%
Don't trust anyone.

1343
01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.000 line:82%
You mustn't get fooled.

1344
01:11:03.066 --> 01:11:04.100 line:82%
Jae-seok.

1345
01:11:05.033 --> 01:11:07.266 line:82%
-Mister, be careful.
-Be careful.

1346
01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.967 line:82%
-Mister, be careful.
-Be careful.

1347
01:11:12.033 --> 01:11:13.834 line:82%
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

1348
01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:17.567 line:82%
-Be careful.
-
You mustn't get fooled.

1349
01:11:18.633 --> 01:11:20.867 line:82%
-This is scary.
-But his acting is incredible.

1350
01:11:20.934 --> 01:11:22.934 line:82%
-It's so scary.
-Did he fall down for real just now?

1351
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.834 line:82%
-To be honest…
-He lost his balance, right?

1352
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.200 line:82%
I think he lost his balance.

1353
01:11:28.266 --> 01:11:30.400 line:82%
I thought he was turning into a zombie.

1354
01:11:30.967 --> 01:11:33.266 line:82%
He's such a great actor.

1355
01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:35.667 line:82%
He startled me.

1356
01:11:35.734 --> 01:11:37.533 line:82%
He told us not to trust anyone.

1357
01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.934 line:82%
He kept saying that.

1358
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.100 line:82%
-It means we shouldn't trust each other.
-Not even the team.

1359
01:11:42.166 --> 01:11:44.934 line:82%
-I don't trust anyone.
-It has always been that way.

1360
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.734 line:82%
We don't trust anyone.

1361
01:11:50.433 --> 01:11:51.600 line:82%
It's time to play a game.

1362
01:11:52.333 --> 01:11:53.934 line:82%
-I trust no one.
-I trust no one.

1363
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.734 line:82%
Let's not trust anyone.

1364
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.700 line:82%
I'm so exhausted today
because of Tae-hyun.

1365
01:12:02.333 --> 01:12:04.500 line:82%
-In the restroom, he kept…
-It's you, right?

1366
01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:07.500 line:82%
No. He kept going,
"I'll help you. Don't worry."

1367
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.200 line:82%
Gosh, that punk.

1368
01:12:10.266 --> 01:12:12.266 line:82%
He drains my energy.

1369
01:12:12.967 --> 01:12:16.066 line:82%
We gathered around
at a different place today.

1370
01:12:16.133 --> 01:12:19.166 line:82%
-I'll help you today.
-For goodness' sake.

1371
01:12:19.867 --> 01:12:21.200 line:82%
Don't you think you're too into character?

1372
01:12:21.266 --> 01:12:23.066 line:82%
He pesters me so much.

1373
01:12:23.734 --> 01:12:25.500 line:82%
-You're his target.
-For goodness' sake.

1374
01:12:25.567 --> 01:12:27.600 line:82%
Give me the Book of Prophecies.

1375
01:12:27.667 --> 01:12:30.066 line:82%
-This? Why?
-Yes.

1376
01:12:30.133 --> 01:12:32.900 line:82%
-It's okay. We know the items.
-We missed something.

1377
01:12:32.967 --> 01:12:34.567 line:82%
-What?
-What?

1378
01:12:34.633 --> 01:12:36.400 line:82%
No way.

1379
01:12:36.467 --> 01:12:39.333 line:82%
Did someone carry out a mission?

1380
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.767 line:82%
What?

1381
01:12:41.333 --> 01:12:43.300 line:82%
See what he crossed out.

1382
01:12:43.367 --> 01:12:44.767 line:82%
-What?
-Whose is it?

1383
01:12:44.834 --> 01:12:47.000 line:82%
"Jae-seok will hug Jung-ha."

1384
01:12:48.166 --> 01:12:50.700 line:82%
1. JAE-SEOK WILL HUG JUNG-HA

1385
01:12:52.967 --> 01:12:54.500 line:82%
-I haven't been hugged.
-I didn't do it.

1386
01:12:54.567 --> 01:12:58.233 line:82%
-Jae-seok wouldn't do it openly. No way.
-I haven't been hugged.

1387
01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:02.400 line:82%
We forgot to cross it out
when Jae-seok hugged him,

1388
01:13:02.467 --> 01:13:03.667 line:82%
so we did it just now.

1389
01:13:03.734 --> 01:13:05.600 line:82%
-You hugged him.
-When did I do that?

1390
01:13:05.667 --> 01:13:06.567 line:82%
Just now?

1391
01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:09.233 line:82%
Did you hug him when he fell down?

1392
01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.934 line:82%
I never did that. When did I hug Jung-ha?

1393
01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:17.100 line:82%
In any case, it won't be complete…

1394
01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:18.900 line:82%
-unless I take a photo.
-That's right.

1395
01:13:18.967 --> 01:13:20.967 line:82%
-Tae-hyun has to cry.
-He has to cry.

1396
01:13:21.033 --> 01:13:22.700 line:82%
-I…
-It's as I said earlier.

1397
01:13:22.767 --> 01:13:25.233 line:82%
When it comes to completing
all of the missions,

1398
01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.000 line:82%
crying is crucial.

1399
01:13:27.066 --> 01:13:29.066 line:82%
No one can force Tae-hyun to cry.

1400
01:13:29.133 --> 01:13:30.066 line:82%
Instead of that mission…

1401
01:13:30.133 --> 01:13:32.233 line:82%
He just needs to cry.

1402
01:13:35.567 --> 01:13:38.100 line:82%
The game we'll play is…

1403
01:13:38.166 --> 01:13:40.834 line:82%
the Tingting Tangtang Up to 12 Frying Pan.

1404
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.467 line:82%
-What's that?
-Up to 12?

1405
01:13:43.533 --> 01:13:46.033 line:82%
Each team will decide on a category.

1406
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.300 line:82%
For example, it could be
food or country names.

1407
01:13:49.367 --> 01:13:52.300 line:82%
Let's say Jung-ha says, "Kimchi stew,"

1408
01:13:52.367 --> 01:13:55.000 line:82%
JENNIE says, "Doenjang stew,"
and Se-chan says, "Spicy pork."

1409
01:13:55.066 --> 01:13:57.967 line:82%
-If it's 11 kimchi stew…
-Then what?

1410
01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:59.700 line:82%
Kimchi stew, kimchi stew.

1411
01:13:59.767 --> 01:14:02.100 line:82%
Kimchi stew, kimchi stew.

1412
01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:05.133 line:82%
-Kimchi stew, kimchi stew, kimchi stew.
-That's how it goes.

1413
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.567 line:82%
My goodness.

1414
01:14:07.633 --> 01:14:09.367 line:82%
We'll win.

1415
01:14:09.433 --> 01:14:10.700 line:82%
Okay. We'll win.

1416
01:14:10.767 --> 01:14:13.033 line:82%
-We'll win.
-We'll win.

1417
01:14:15.066 --> 01:14:17.533 line:82%
Now, I'll decide on the category.

1418
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.500 line:82%
-For the Yangs, it's food.
-Thank you.

1419
01:14:19.567 --> 01:14:21.667 line:82%
-For the Yus, it's animals.
-Animals.

1420
01:14:21.734 --> 01:14:25.800 line:82%
-Food is easier.
-You can look things up on the Internet

1421
01:14:25.867 --> 01:14:27.800 line:82%
to come up with a difficult name.

1422
01:14:27.867 --> 01:14:29.800 line:82%
We pick food items for them.

1423
01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:31.333 line:82%
With four syllables?

1424
01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.500 line:82%
Food.

1425
01:14:32.567 --> 01:14:34.934 line:82%
There are many endangered animals.

1426
01:14:35.433 --> 01:14:37.834 line:82%
Jae-seok, there are
many endangered animals.

1427
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.000 line:82%
That little…

1428
01:14:39.567 --> 01:14:43.200 line:82%
-Let's hear it.
-Let's choose the animals that suit them.

1429
01:14:43.266 --> 01:14:45.667 line:82%
-I have a suggestion for Jae-seok.
-What? Nutria?

1430
01:14:45.734 --> 01:14:47.266 line:82%
Naked mole-rat.

1431
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.734 line:82%

1437
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.233 line:82%
-Mole-rat.
-Add "rat" too.

1438
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.834 line:82%
Such an animal actually exists.

1439
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.433 line:82%
I can't believe Jung-ha.

1440
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.900 line:82%
Naked mole-rats have teeth like yours.

1441
01:15:05.967 --> 01:15:07.667 line:82%
-Naked mole-rat then?
-Yes.

1488
01:16:47.633 --> 01:16:50.000 line:82%
I thought it was perfect.
Why did I say, "Mussel"?

1489
01:16:50.066 --> 01:16:51.533 line:82%
Maybe because he looks like a mussel.

1490
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.100 line:82%
-He looked at me and said, "Mussel."

-Why?
-Is it someone's birthday?

1698
01:25:14.834 --> 01:25:17.500 line:82%
What? Why did you turn off the light?
Will a ghost come out?

1699
01:25:17.567 --> 01:25:18.533 line:82%
What's this?

1700
01:25:19.066 --> 01:25:20.433 line:82%

My joke turned out to be true.

1708
01:26:01.533 --> 01:26:03.300 line:82%
My shoulder hurts.

1711
01:26:07.834 --> 01:26:09.800 line:82%
I'm sorry that I left you behind.

1712
01:26:09.867 --> 01:26:10.800 line:82%
I can't believe it.

1713
01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:14.533 line:82%

1718
01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:23.500 line:82%
They're the residents who made us food.

01:26:24.333 --> 01:26:26.500 line:82%
They're the residents who made us food.

1720
01:26:26.567 --> 01:26:29.000 line:82%
-The owner of the tteokbokki stall.
-Yes.

1721
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.934 line:82%
He's the resident representative.

1722
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.166 line:82%
-Hello.
-Hello.

1723
01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:38.633 line:82%

they even built an apartment
for the followers.

They're the residents who made us food.

1728
01:26:50.834 --> 01:26:53.300 line:82%
They're the ones
whose soles we need to check.

01:27:48.066 --> 01:27:49.734 line:82%
There's something on their soles.

1742
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.900 line:82%
-There's something.
-There's something on their soles.

1743

1755
01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.967 line:82%
"Woo-yong"?

1756

It must be a name. A name.

1757

1761
01:28:56.567 --> 01:28:58.600 line:82%
-Se-chan.
-What are you doing?

1762
01:29:02.033 --> 01:29:04.000 line:82%
That monkfish.

1763
01:29:04.066 --> 01:29:05.900 line:82%

1778
01:29:37.266 --> 01:29:38.700 line:82%
-Where is he? I see him.
-The front row.

1779
01:29:38.767 --> 01:29:41.467 line:82%
He's in the middle. He must have power.

1780
01:29:41.533 --> 01:29:43.934 line:82%
Woo-il has been dragged in too.

1781
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.467 line:82%
But…

1782
01:29:45.533 --> 01:29:47.600 line:82%

1787
01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.100 line:82%
Mister.

1788
01:30:03.367 --> 01:30:05.700 line:82%
-He just left.
-I'm jealous. Mister, I'm jealous.

1789
01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.567 line:82%
He left last
as if he was the main character.

1790
01:30:08.233 --> 01:30:10.266 line:82%
How did he end up joining a cult?

1791
01:30:10.333 --> 01:30:12.800 line:82%
The red letters are a hint
on the cult leader.

1792
01:30:12.867 --> 01:30:15.533 line:82%
Please begin deducing now.

1793
01:30:20.066 --> 01:30:22.066 line:82%
"Once all the predictions come true,

1794
01:30:22.133 --> 01:30:24.367 line:82%
the day the cult leader talked about
will come."

1795
01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:31.500 line:82%
Choose a member
and get him or her on the altar.

1796
01:30:31.567 --> 01:30:33.967 line:82%
-Is there a cult leader among us?
-Among us?

1797
01:30:35.266 --> 01:30:37.433 line:82%
Do we need to get the cult leader
on the altar?

1798
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.367 line:82%
A religious organization
used talk of doomsday

1799
01:30:40.433 --> 01:30:42.934 line:82%
and extorted over 38 billion won
from its followers.

1800
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.700 line:82%
Over 150 billion won

1802
01:30:48.633 --> 01:30:52.033 line:82%
the followers were driven out
of their homes and workplaces.

1803
01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:53.367 line:82%
Some even committed suicide.

1804
01:30:53.433 --> 01:30:57.433 line:82%
Meanwhile, the mastermind
of the biggest fraud in the 20th century,

1805
01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.166 line:82%
A, ran away from the police.

1806
01:30:59.233 --> 01:31:01.600 line:82%
A's whereabouts are unknown.

1807
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.300 line:82%
I just have one letter,
ryu.

1808
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.900 line:82%
I just have one letter,
ryu.

1809
01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.233 line:82%

1813
01:31:34.867 --> 01:31:38.133 line:82%
-JENNIE is something else.
-Tell me.

1814
01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.767 line:82%
-I got goosebumps.
-It's right.

1815
01:31:39.834 --> 01:31:40.834 line:82%
What is it?

1816
01:31:43.433 --> 01:31:45.333 line:82%
JENNIE, share your theory.

1817
01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.700 line:82%
-Okay.

1818
01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:49.033 line:82%
The red letters spelled out "Tiger."

-The hint was "Tiger."
-Tiger.

1820
01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:55.166 line:82%
We talked about
our Chinese zodiac signs recently.

1821
01:31:55.233 --> 01:31:57.166 line:82%
Two people were born
in the Year of the Tiger.

1822

01:32:18.467 --> 01:32:19.467 line:82%
A red tiger?

Ryu.
-I saw
ryu
too.

1846
01:32:54.033 --> 01:32:55.233 line:82%
-Was
ryu
red?
-Yes.

1847
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.767 line:82%
-
Ryu
was red.
-Yes.

1848
01:33:01.533 --> 01:33:05.033 line:82%
Ryu, ryong.
So there were
ryu, ryong,
and tiger.

1849
01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.967 line:82%
Ryu Seung-ryong?

1850
01:33:07.033 --> 01:33:08.767 line:82%
Ryu Seung-ryong?

1851
01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:10.567 line:82%
Ryu Seung-ryong?

1852
01:33:23.033 --> 01:33:24.867 line:82%
Ryu Seung-ryong.

1853
01:33:24.934 --> 01:33:29.033 line:82%
-September. Your birthday was last week.
-Ryu Seung-ryong.

1854
01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:32.200 line:82%
-Ryu Seung-ryong and tiger.
-Ryu Seung-ryong and tiger.

1855
01:33:32.266 --> 01:33:34.200 line:82%
-Ryu Seung-ryong…
-Then…

1856
01:33:34.266 --> 01:33:35.834 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-I'm innocent.

1857
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.700 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-
Moving.

1858
01:33:37.767 --> 01:33:38.767 line:82%
-It's you.
-You.

1859
01:33:38.834 --> 01:33:40.800 line:82%
-Jung-ha.
-
Moving.

1860
01:33:40.867 --> 01:33:41.767 line:82%
-You.
-It's you.

1861
01:33:41.834 --> 01:33:43.133 line:82%
-You.
-It's you.

1862
01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.767 line:82%
Where did Ryu Seung-ryong come from?
It might not be
seung.

1863
01:33:45.834 --> 01:33:48.467 line:82%
You were in
Moving
too. Come here.

1864
01:33:48.533 --> 01:33:50.600 line:82%
-Go over there.
-Go over there.

1865
01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:51.900 line:82%
-Those three.
-You too.

1866
01:33:54.266 --> 01:33:56.400 line:82%
Hold on. Didn't you film
something with him?

1867
01:33:56.467 --> 01:33:57.800 line:82%
I did.

1868
01:33:58.900 --> 01:33:59.900 line:82%
MOVING

1869
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.500 line:82%
-Those three.
-You too. Come here.

1870
01:34:08.567 --> 01:34:13.000 line:82%
I don't know Ryu Seung-ryong personally.

1871
01:34:13.066 --> 01:34:16.300 line:82%
I don't know
the
Miracle in Cell No. 7
actor.

1872
01:34:16.367 --> 01:34:18.533 line:82%
-I wasn't born in the Year of the Tiger.
-Come back.

1873
01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.834 line:82%
It's one of the two.

1874
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.900 line:82%
It's one of the two.

1875
01:34:21.967 --> 01:34:24.800 line:82%
-Wait.
-We narrowed things down.

1876
01:34:24.867 --> 01:34:28.734 line:82%
-It's one of the two.
-We narrowed things down.

1877
01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.166 line:82%
I feel so victimized.

1878
01:34:31.233 --> 01:34:34.900 line:82%
This is exactly like the last time.

1879
01:34:38.633 --> 01:34:41.100 line:82%
WHO IS THE CULT LEADER?

1880
01:34:41.166 --> 01:34:43.033 line:82%
OH NA-RA?

1881
01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:44.867 line:82%
LEE JUNG-HA?

1882
01:34:44.934 --> 01:34:46.367 line:82%
Give me the Book of Prophecies.

1883
01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:51.533 line:82%
-We… Hey.
-There's no way he hid the shoe.

1884
01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:56.133 line:82%
Why are you guys talking separately?

1885
01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.867 line:82%
Are you jealous?

1886
01:34:57.934 --> 01:35:01.033 line:82%
Jae-seok, JENNIE and I spent
the entire day with Jung-ha.

1887
01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.433 line:82%
-Look.
-Tell everyone

1888
01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:05.433 line:82%
-about the shoe.
-We need to take caution.

1889
01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:08.200 line:82%
-We need to go over the prophecies.
-Yes.

1890
01:35:08.266 --> 01:35:09.300 line:82%
I feel victimized.

1891
01:35:09.367 --> 01:35:11.500 line:82%
-I looked for clues diligently.
-I agree.

1892
01:35:16.567 --> 01:35:18.600 line:82%
And I know one thing for certain.

1893
01:35:18.667 --> 01:35:21.200 line:82%
-What?
-Na-ra stained Jung-ha's clothes.

1894
01:35:21.266 --> 01:35:22.400 line:82%
Did I do that?

1895
01:35:22.467 --> 01:35:25.700 line:82%
-Na-ra stained Jung-ha's clothes.
-Did I do that?

1896
01:35:25.767 --> 01:35:28.900 line:82%
When the pork cutlets came,
she suddenly cut one up…

1897
01:35:28.967 --> 01:35:29.934 line:82%
-She came.
-She came.

1898
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.800 line:82%
She left with a piece on a fork.

1899
01:35:31.867 --> 01:35:35.300 line:82%
JENNIE said she wanted to eat pork cutlet.

1900
01:35:35.367 --> 01:35:37.967 line:82%
-Did you say that?
-But I never got to eat it.

1901
01:35:38.033 --> 01:35:41.033 line:82%
JENNIE said she wouldn't eat it.

1902
01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.934 line:82%
But she suddenly enticed me
with the pork cutlet.

1903
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.100 line:82%
I bit into the piece.

1904
01:35:46.166 --> 01:35:47.867 line:82%
Hey. For goodness' sake.

1905
01:35:47.934 --> 01:35:50.400 line:82%
Come here. Open wide. There you go.

1906
01:35:50.467 --> 01:35:53.133 line:82%
-Aren't you going to give it to me?
-Eat it.

1907
01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.967 line:82%
Eat it. There you go.

1908
01:35:56.033 --> 01:35:59.166 line:82%
Close the door. I figured out something
that gave me goosebumps.

1909
01:35:59.233 --> 01:36:01.800 line:82%
-I smelled it. It isn't this food.
-The stain.

1910
01:36:01.867 --> 01:36:03.700 line:82%
-It's the other team's pork cutlet.
-What?

1911
01:36:03.767 --> 01:36:06.467 line:82%
Na-ra tempted me
with a piece of pork cutlet earlier.

1912
01:36:06.533 --> 01:36:08.667 line:82%
-Is the smell the same?
-It's the same.

1913
01:36:08.734 --> 01:36:10.133 line:82%
-See?
-You're a genius.

1914
01:36:12.367 --> 01:36:14.900 line:82%
Hey. For goodness' sake. Let's take it.

1915
01:36:14.967 --> 01:36:15.967 line:82%
Let's take it.

1916
01:36:16.033 --> 01:36:17.133 line:82%
4. NA-RA WILL SNAP A GROUP PHOTO

1917
01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.433 line:82%
-Let's see what happens when I take it.
-We can't take it.

1918
01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:20.667 line:82%
Let's take it.

1919
01:36:20.734 --> 01:36:22.800 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-But…

1920
01:36:22.867 --> 01:36:25.433 line:82%
I get that you're desperate.

1921
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.200 line:82%
Are you trying to mess things up?

1922
01:36:29.266 --> 01:36:31.467 line:82%
-Na-ra.
-I'm not the cult leader.

1923
01:36:31.533 --> 01:36:32.667 line:82%
Na-ra.

1924
01:36:32.734 --> 01:36:34.567 line:82%
-I don't think it's her.
-Na-ra?

1925
01:36:34.633 --> 01:36:35.834 line:82%
I figured it out.

1926
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:38.533 line:82%
-It doesn't seem like it's Na-ra.
-It really isn't me.

1927
01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.433 line:82%
-Hold on.
-It really isn't me.

1928
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:45.767 line:82%
-Hold on.
-It really isn't me.

1929
01:36:45.834 --> 01:36:47.834 line:82%
It really isn't me either.

1930
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:51.000 line:82%
-It really isn't me either.
-We're having a meeting. Stay here.

1931
01:36:51.066 --> 01:36:54.934 line:82%
-It really isn't me either.
-We're having a meeting. Stay here.

1932
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.400 line:82%
Let us talk.

1933
01:36:56.467 --> 01:36:58.600 line:82%
-It's confusing.
-Is it Na-ra?

1934
01:36:58.667 --> 01:37:00.400 line:82%
JENNIE, let's be honest.

1935
01:37:00.467 --> 01:37:03.467 line:82%
When we were together,
someone made a mistake.

1936
01:37:03.533 --> 01:37:05.233 line:82%
-JENNIE, explain.
-What mistake?

1937
01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:08.333 line:82%
-Shall I really explain what happened?
-Go ahead.

1938
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.767 line:82%
The production crew might not know.

1939
01:37:10.834 --> 01:37:12.767 line:82%
-Shall I?
-Go ahead. We have no choice.

1940
01:37:12.834 --> 01:37:17.667 line:82%
The resident representative
came and said hello.

1941
01:37:17.734 --> 01:37:18.800 line:82%
-To your unit?
-Yes.

1942
01:37:18.867 --> 01:37:20.800 line:82%
-Yes.
-We took photos with her last week.

1943
01:37:20.867 --> 01:37:22.533 line:82%
She said,

1944
01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.734 line:82%
"I took a photo with Na-ra yesterday."

1945
01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.934 line:82%
"I took a photo with Na-ra yesterday."

1946
01:37:29.734 --> 01:37:31.533 line:82%
-I took a photo with her.
-Yesterday?

1947
01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.500 line:82%
Yesterday?

1948
01:37:32.567 --> 01:37:35.300 line:82%
-She said yesterday. We deducted…
-Yesterday?

1949
01:37:35.367 --> 01:37:38.100 line:82%
-…Na-ra had an additional shoot yesterday.
-Yes.

1950
01:37:38.166 --> 01:37:41.433 line:82%
She came one day early
and had an additional shoot.

1951
01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.867 line:82%
The resident representative let it slip.

1952
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.533 line:82%
-I brought some tangerines.
-Thank you.

1953
01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.900 line:82%
-Take photos.
-Hello.

1954
01:37:50.967 --> 01:37:55.900 line:82%
I took a photo with Oh Na-ra yesterday.

1955
01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.133 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

1956
01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:03.967 line:82%
She said it was yesterday.

1957
01:38:04.033 --> 01:38:07.166 line:82%
-I know. I guess Na-ra came yesterday.
-She came yesterday.

1958
01:38:08.433 --> 01:38:10.467 line:82%
-It's an accident.
-An accident.

1959
01:38:10.533 --> 01:38:11.934 line:82%
My goodness.

1960
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.500 line:82%
-We can't say anything.
-We should keep quiet.

1961
01:38:14.567 --> 01:38:16.633 line:82%
It was during break time.
The cameras were off.

1962
01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.667 line:82%
The cameras were off.

1963
01:38:19.333 --> 01:38:22.700 line:82%
She came one day early
and had an additional shoot.

1964
01:38:22.767 --> 01:38:25.233 line:82%
The resident representative let it slip.

1965
01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:28.367 line:82%
I took a photo with Na-ra.
I have to take one with you too.

1966
01:38:28.867 --> 01:38:31.500 line:82%
-Let's put Na-ra on the altar.
-We must.

1967
01:38:31.567 --> 01:38:33.567 line:82%
-Let's put Na-ra on the altar.
-We must.

1968
01:38:33.633 --> 01:38:35.133 line:82%
-Hold on.
-Oh Na-ra.

1969
01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.900 line:82%
It really isn't me.

1970
01:38:36.967 --> 01:38:39.000 line:82%
You guys will regret it. It isn't me.

1971
01:38:39.066 --> 01:38:40.967 line:82%
It really isn't me.

1972
01:38:41.033 --> 01:38:42.734 line:82%
-Look at me.
-Gosh, it isn't me.

1973
01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:45.000 line:82%
-It isn't you, right?
-It really isn't me.

1974
01:38:45.066 --> 01:38:46.300 line:82%
-I don't think it's him.
-Really?

1975
01:38:46.367 --> 01:38:48.600 line:82%
It isn't me. You'll regret it.
For goodness' sake.

1976
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.033 line:82%
For goodness' sake.

1977
01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:52.834 line:82%
Let's get it right today.

1978
01:38:56.734 --> 01:38:58.233 line:82%
I don't know who it is.

1979
01:39:01.367 --> 01:39:04.133 line:82%
-Let's see.
-
In 1972,

1980
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.166 line:82%
the Daehan Woosang Cult
Jinrihoe Church was founded.

1981
01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:11.667 line:82%
Amidst many lies,
our final sanctuary came to be.

1982
01:39:11.734 --> 01:39:13.800 line:82%
She was born in 1972.

1983
01:39:13.867 --> 01:39:16.233 line:82%
In 1997,

1984
01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.166 line:82%
the leader of the church
ascended to heaven,

1985
01:39:19.233 --> 01:39:21.700 line:82%
and the followers nearly lost their way.

1986
01:39:21.767 --> 01:39:23.867 line:82%
-The leader ascended to heaven.
-I see.

1987
01:39:24.266 --> 01:39:26.500 line:82%
In 1998,

1988
01:39:26.567 --> 01:39:28.834 line:82%
the second leader emerged,

1989
01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:34.367 line:82%
and Daehan Woosang Cult Jinrihoe Church
welcomed heaven once again.

1990
01:39:34.433 --> 01:39:36.800 line:82%
Those aren't men's hands.

1991
01:39:36.867 --> 01:39:39.333 line:82%
I guess Na-ra came yesterday
to shoot that scene.

1992
01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:42.300 line:82%
Did she really come yesterday?

1993
01:39:44.667 --> 01:39:48.900 line:82%
Our leader is loved
for their flower-like beauty.

1994
01:39:51.533 --> 01:39:54.900 line:82%
"Flower-like beauty" might be
about Jung-ha.

1995
01:39:54.967 --> 01:39:59.300 line:82%
Our leader lights up the world
with their doe-like eyes.

1996
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.100 line:82%
-I do have doe-like eyes.
-Yes.

1997
01:40:02.166 --> 01:40:03.667 line:82%
But Na-ra does too.

1998
01:40:03.734 --> 01:40:06.300 line:82%
-He's attacking me.
-No.

1999
01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:11.300 line:82%
Our true king has descended to Earth.

2000
01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.333 line:82%
We will praise our leader forever.

2001
01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.033 line:82%
We will follow our leader forever.

2002
01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:19.734 line:82%
My deity.

2003
01:40:20.233 --> 01:40:21.700 line:82%
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

2004
01:40:24.867 --> 01:40:27.600 line:82%
It really isn't me.

2005
01:40:28.433 --> 01:40:30.867 line:82%
-
It really isn't me.
-
Really?

2006
01:40:32.367 --> 01:40:35.500 line:82%
Our true idol.

2007
01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.467 line:82%
Lee Jung-ha.

2008
01:40:50.266 --> 01:40:51.800 line:82%
Hey!

2009
01:40:53.033 --> 01:40:54.800 line:82%
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

2010
01:40:57.233 --> 01:40:58.533 line:82%
Hey!

2011
01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:01.333 line:82%
Hey!

2012
01:41:05.467 --> 01:41:09.000 line:82%
-My goodness.
-You practically filmed a movie.

2013
01:41:09.066 --> 01:41:10.266 line:82%
Jae-seok, I got goosebumps.

2014
01:41:10.333 --> 01:41:12.467 line:82%
Why did we fall for an obvious trick?

2015
01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:14.400 line:82%
I know. Why did we do that?

2016
01:41:16.433 --> 01:41:17.767 line:82%
I finally won.

2017
01:41:22.967 --> 01:41:24.266 line:82%
Let's begin.

2018
01:41:24.333 --> 01:41:26.367 line:82%
-Leader.
-Leader.

2019
01:41:26.433 --> 01:41:28.300 line:82%
Leader, I believe in you.

2020
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.433 line:82%
I'm the cult leader, everyone.

2021
01:41:35.533 --> 01:41:38.200 line:82%
I'll serve you.

2022
01:41:40.567 --> 01:41:43.000 line:82%
I always showed my foolish side.

2023
01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.900 line:82%
This time, I'll truly go crazy.

2024
01:41:47.233 --> 01:41:48.700 line:82%
Let's begin.

2025
01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.333 line:82%
-We believe in you.
-We believe in you.

2026
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.834 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Cut.

2027
01:42:04.166 --> 01:42:05.767 line:82%
I really want to win.

2028
01:42:05.834 --> 01:42:09.567 line:82%
In my opinion, Jae-seok

2029
01:42:09.633 --> 01:42:11.300 line:82%
is very friendly.

2030
01:42:11.367 --> 01:42:15.433 line:82%
I think he'll hug me as he says hello.

2031
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500 line:82%
"Jae-seok will hug Jung-ha."

2032
01:42:18.233 --> 01:42:19.934 line:82%
It isn't you, is it?

2033
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.533 line:82%
Hey.

2034
01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.767 line:82%
Did you forget what happened last week?

2035
01:42:24.834 --> 01:42:25.900 line:82%
It isn't you, is it?

2036
01:42:25.967 --> 01:42:28.633 line:82%
You fell for JENNIE's lies.

2037
01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:32.633 line:82%
I think it'll be better to steal
an item from Se-chan.

2038
01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:34.600 line:82%
-Let's go.
-Let's go to unit 406.

2039
01:42:34.667 --> 01:42:37.133 line:82%
-Let's take a look around.
-Trust me.

2040
01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.333 line:82%
There's nowhere to hide…

2041
01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.600 line:82%
Trust me.

2042
01:42:39.667 --> 01:42:41.900 line:82%
There's nowhere to hide
other than the closet.

2043
01:42:41.967 --> 01:42:44.367 line:82%
There's nowhere to hide
other than the closet.

2044
01:42:44.433 --> 01:42:45.767 line:82%
What? It's empty.

2045
01:42:45.834 --> 01:42:47.066 line:82%
…other than the closet.

2046
01:42:47.133 --> 01:42:48.133 line:82%
What? It's empty.

2047
01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.367 line:82%
-Someone's there.
-Totally.

2048
01:42:49.433 --> 01:42:51.200 line:82%
-Was it obvious?
-It was very obvious.

2049
01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.667 line:82%
3. SE-CHAN WILL LOSE A SHOE

2050
01:42:58.734 --> 01:43:00.300 line:82%
Se-chan.

2051
01:43:01.433 --> 01:43:03.133 line:82%
-Slickback.
-Slickback.

2052
01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.500 line:82%
How does the dance go?

2053
01:43:05.867 --> 01:43:06.900 line:82%
-Try hard.
-Can you do it?

2054
01:43:06.967 --> 01:43:08.433 line:82%
No, I can't.

2055
01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.066 line:82%
You must know the steps.

2056
01:43:10.934 --> 01:43:12.834 line:82%
You keep your heels up.

2057
01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:16.000 line:82%
-They don't touch the ground.
-The heels.

2058
01:43:16.633 --> 01:43:20.200 line:82%
Na-ra loves to take group photos. Okay.

2059
01:43:20.266 --> 01:43:22.000 line:82%
Tae-hyun's tears?

2060
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.633 line:82%
-I could hit him.
-Hit him and make him cry.

2061
01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:30.400 line:82%
Perhaps he could cry from laughter.
He could go, "I'm in tears."

2062
01:43:32.333 --> 01:43:34.100 line:82%
I have a chilling idea.

2063
01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:37.767 line:82%
My prophecy can be,
"Jung-ha will get stains on his clothes."

2064
01:43:37.834 --> 01:43:40.900 line:82%
Then I can go, "I don't know
how I got these stains."

2065
01:43:42.033 --> 01:43:46.667 line:82%
-Aren't you going to give it to me?
-Eat it. There you go.

2066
01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.166 line:82%
6. JUNG-HA WILL GET STAINS
ON HIS CLOTHES

2067
01:43:54.233 --> 01:43:56.967 line:82%
-Some items are crossed out.
-Hey, his clothes are stained.

2068
01:43:57.033 --> 01:43:58.266 line:82%
-Come here. What's that?
-Where?

2069
01:43:58.333 --> 01:44:00.400 line:82%
When did it happen?

2070
01:44:00.467 --> 01:44:01.467 line:82%
What's this?

2071
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.367 line:82%
I won't lose in vain.

2072
01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:09.467 line:82%
-I can't face Jung-ha again.
-Seriously, I…

2073
01:44:09.533 --> 01:44:11.000 line:82%
-He…
-Seriously, I…

2074
01:44:11.066 --> 01:44:12.767 line:82%
Look at his face.

2075
01:44:12.834 --> 01:44:15.266 line:82%
-Pork cutlet got on his clothes.
-His face.

2076
01:44:15.333 --> 01:44:16.667 line:82%
Look at his face.

2077
01:44:16.734 --> 01:44:18.166 line:82%
Pork cutlet got on his clothes.

2078
01:44:19.367 --> 01:44:21.667 line:82%
You said Na-ra got tteokbokki
on his clothes.

2079
01:44:21.734 --> 01:44:24.233 line:82%
You talked about
the resident representative.

2080
01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.400 line:82%
They got fooled.

2081
01:44:27.967 --> 01:44:30.500 line:82%
-There's another video.
-For goodness' sake.

2082
01:44:30.567 --> 01:44:32.166 line:82%
What's this?

2083
01:44:36.033 --> 01:44:37.633 line:82%
One, two, three.

2084
01:44:40.633 --> 01:44:44.166 line:82%
The resident representatives.

2085
01:44:44.233 --> 01:44:46.233 line:82%
-On the first day?
-Yes.

2086
01:44:49.533 --> 01:44:50.967 line:82%
She's the real resident representative.

2087
01:44:51.767 --> 01:44:52.767 line:82%
All right.

2088
01:44:54.033 --> 01:44:57.266 line:82%
Thank you for helping us with the shoot.

2089
01:44:57.333 --> 01:44:58.300 line:82%
You're so young.

2090
01:44:58.367 --> 01:45:01.000 line:82%
-That's right.
-They came today as well.

2091
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.066 line:82%
-Hello.
-Hello.

2092
01:45:03.934 --> 01:45:06.233 line:82%
-Hello.

We saw them again.

2093
01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.500 line:82%
That's right.

2094
01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:10.500 line:82%
The two of them took photos with them.

2095
01:45:12.734 --> 01:45:14.500 line:82%
Hello.

2096
01:45:14.567 --> 01:45:16.567 line:82%
-
Yes, we saw them.
-
They were sitting there.

2097
01:45:16.633 --> 01:45:18.166 line:82%
They were there.

2098
01:45:21.734 --> 01:45:24.233 line:82%
-What?
-Why?

2099
01:45:31.433 --> 01:45:33.100 line:82%
Can we enter now?

2100
01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.734 line:82%
Three weeks?

2101
01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.367 line:82%
That's insane.

2102
01:45:38.667 --> 01:45:40.266 line:82%
Three weeks?

2103
01:45:40.333 --> 01:45:42.900 line:82%
-That's insane.
-I can't believe it.

2104
01:45:44.233 --> 01:45:46.166 line:82%
-My goodness.
-We fell for it.

2105
01:45:46.233 --> 01:45:48.967 line:82%
I took a photo with Na-ra yesterday,

2106
01:45:49.033 --> 01:45:52.200 line:82%
-but not with you.
-This is exciting.

2107
01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:55.834 line:82%
-"Don't trust anyone."
-Actors.

2108
01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:57.233 line:82%
Don't trust anyone.

2109
01:45:57.867 --> 01:45:59.266 line:82%
Are they actors?

2110
01:45:59.834 --> 01:46:03.033 line:82%
Don't lie. Are you saying
they aren't resident representatives?

2111
01:46:06.266 --> 01:46:07.400 line:82%
What?

2112
01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.900 line:82%
What's that?

2113
01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:17.467 line:82%
-Woosang Cult! Let's go.
-Let's go.

2114
01:46:19.967 --> 01:46:22.467 line:82%
-My goodness.
-I can't believe it.

2115
01:46:23.567 --> 01:46:24.600 line:82%
Are you serious?

2116
01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.400 line:82%
I can't believe it.

2117
01:46:28.467 --> 01:46:31.300 line:82%
-I want to break his fingers.
-I know.

2118
01:46:31.367 --> 01:46:33.166 line:82%
-I want to break his fingers.
-I know.

2119
01:46:35.233 --> 01:46:37.100 line:82%
He was close to tears earlier.

2120
01:46:37.166 --> 01:46:38.433 line:82%
We totally got fooled.

2121
01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:40.433 line:82%
Why did you say
that you wanted pork cutlet?

2122
01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:42.400 line:82%
I was trying to keep you from entering.

2123
01:46:43.367 --> 01:46:45.400 line:82%
I was trying to keep you from entering.

2124
01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:47.100 line:82%
I'm sorry.

2125
01:46:47.166 --> 01:46:49.266 line:82%
-Did Jung-ha win?
-Yes.

2126
01:46:49.333 --> 01:46:51.333 line:82%
I won't get fooled by Jung-ha again.

2127
01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.166 line:82%
A cult leader and their spouse
who used talk of doomsday

2128
01:46:56.233 --> 01:47:00.166 line:82%
to make followers take out loans
that amounted to tens of billions of won

2129
01:47:00.233 --> 01:47:03.066 line:82%
were sentenced
to ten years of imprisonment.

2130

The justice department stated that crimes

2131
01:47:05.767 --> 01:47:07.734 line:82%
using religion
should be punished severely.

2132
01:47:32.266 --> 01:47:33.400 line:82%
Congratulations.

01:47:33.467 --> 01:47:36.800 line:82%
You've been invited

The hidden secret of the apartment

2135
01:47:38.567 --> 01:47:41.867 line:82%
will be unveiled only after you complete
the 25 bingo boards.

2136
01:47:42.867 --> 01:47:44.867 line:82%

I'll give you a lot.

2140
01:47:50.867 --> 01:47:52.033 line:82%
Isn't it smuggling?

2141
01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:54.233 line:82%
All of them are thieves.

2142
01:47:54.934 --> 01:47:57.800 line:82%
Please catch other people instead.

2143
01:47:58.934 --> 01:47:59.834 line:82%
He's running away.

2144
01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:00.900 line:82%
Gosh.

-The national affairs.

2146
