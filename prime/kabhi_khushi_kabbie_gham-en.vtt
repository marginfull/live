00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.667 line:82%
Why is it that a father
is never able to tell his son,

2
00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:52.917 line:82%
how much he loves him?

3
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.292 line:82%
He's never able to embrace him
and say'I love you my son'?

4
00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:00.292 line:82%
And the mother?

5
00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:04.920 line:82%
She keeps repeating it, whether
her son listens to it or not.

6
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.167 line:82%
But that doesn't mean
a father loves his son any less.

7
00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:14.000 line:82%
No one can fathom the amount of love
that a mother has for her son,

8
00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.125 line:82%
not even the mother.

9
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.208 line:82%
Because there is no measure
for a mother's love.

10
00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:20.958 line:82%
It's an emotion
that can only be felt.

11
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.250 line:82%
A mother's emotion.

12
00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.167 line:82%
Rahul, my son, my life!

13
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.780 line:82%
SOMETIMES THERE'S HAPPINESS
SOMETIMES THERE'S SORROW

14
00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:12.417 line:82%
The match between Woodstock
International and Manor House,

15
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.625 line:82%
is at a very interesting turn.
Five runs and one ball.

16
00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:18.760 line:82%
Can Woodstock International's nine-year
victory spell be broken in just a ball?

17
00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:20.792 line:82%
Captain Vivek Singh spreads his field
towards the boundaries

18
00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:23.560 line:82%
and the two batsmen
take their positions.

19
00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:25.375 line:82%
The excitement among the students
is rising.

20
00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:30.940 line:82%
Manor House needs five runs
in one ball. Will Rohan do it?

21
00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:38.708 line:82%
It's up to Rohan to break.

22
00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:41.417 line:82%
Woodstock International's nine-year
spell of victory. Seems impossible.

23
00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:47.333 line:82%
Manor House is confident that
Rohan will do it!

24
00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.083 line:82%
If you want to be someone in life,
if you want to achieve something.

25
00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:19.125 line:82%
If you want to win,
always listen to your heart.

26
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.458 line:82%
And if your heart
doesn't give you any answers,

27
00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:25.500 line:82%
close your eyes and think of your parents.

28
00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:30.208 line:82%
And then you will cross all the hurdles.

29
00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:34.250 line:82%
All your problems will vanish.
Victory will be yours.

30
00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:36.333 line:82%
Only yours.

31
00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:50.292 line:82%
Hey Dad, I watched you on CNN.
You looked great.

32
00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.583 line:82%
Now I know where I get
my good looks from.

33
00:06:52.708 --> 00:06:55.083 line:82%
Anyway, I have just completed
my final term and

34
00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:56.625 line:82%
I'm coming home for Diwali.

35
00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:11.875 line:82%
P.S., P. S., before I come home
I'm stopping at Haridwar to meet

36
00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.917 line:82%
my two favourite girlfriends.

37
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.960 line:82%
Haridwar?
Who are these girlfriends in Haridwar?

38
00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:20.500 line:82%
My two grandmothers,
maternal and paternal!

39
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.542 line:82%
...at morning eight.

40
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.640 line:82%
-Alright.
-Alright.

41
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.125 line:82%
Are you watching the photograph
and crying again?

42
00:07:58.417 --> 00:07:59.667 line:82%
Where am I crying?

43
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.417 line:82%
of course not.
Where are you crying?

44
00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:04.708 line:82%
That's one truth and the other one
is that you are very young.

45
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.333 line:82%
Stop joking with me
early in the morning.

46
00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:10.500 line:82%
What's the matter, Lajoji?

47
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.542 line:82%
I remember Rahul
very of ten these days.

48
00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:16.060 line:82%
Even I remember him.

49
00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:17.917 line:82%
But in the last few days,

50
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.980 line:82%
I have been feeling
very restless with his memories.

51
00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.292 line:82%
But why?

52
00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:24.500 line:82%
Listen.
We have lived our full lives.

53
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:27.208 line:82%
Speak for yourself. I have
a long life ahead. Touch wood!

54
00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:30.980 line:82%
Yes.
But I have to reach God's abode.

55
00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:32.875 line:82%
How will I face Him there?

56
00:08:33.542 --> 00:08:37.292 line:82%
How will I explain the reason,
why I couldn't unite my scattered family?

57
00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:40.940 line:82%
That I couldn't bring
my grandson back home?

58
00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:43.292 line:82%
How will I show my face to Him?

59
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.042 line:82%
Don't worry about it.

60
00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:49.180 line:82%
-You are not going to meet God anyway.
-Why?

61
00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:51.292 line:82%
Because he doesn't meet anyone in Hell.

62
00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:56.083 line:82%
God, again your jokes
early in the morning...

63
00:08:58.083 --> 00:08:59.292 line:82%
Rohan!

64
00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:04.720 line:82%
-Grandma.
-My child.

65
00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:08.700 line:82%
What's the matter, Grandma?
You look very sexy.

66
00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:10.417 line:82%
I know. Everyone says the same thing.

67
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.220 line:82%
Grandma.

68
00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:16.458 line:82%
-Bless me.
-May you live long.

69
00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:21.083 line:82%
You have become very weak my son.

70
00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:24.042 line:82%
Now everyone can't be
as healthy as you are.

71
00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:25.917 line:82%
Oh! Just Shut up now.

72
00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:34.580 line:82%
-What's the matter, Grandma?
-What happened? Is she crying?

73
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.583 line:82%
Then it's fine. I get very worried
when she doesn't weep.

74
00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:40.680 line:82%
Just see. Rohan!

75
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.040 line:82%
Please stop crying Lajoji.
Please stop.

76
00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:56.100 line:82%
Your tears will raise a lot of questions
in Rohan's mind and...

77
00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:58.800 line:82%
we won't have any answers
to his questions.

78
00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:02.020 line:82%
What do I do Kaur?
What do I do?

79
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.542 line:82%
Whenever I see Rohan,
I think of Rahul even more

80
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.540 line:82%
Don't you think we should
tell him everything?

81
00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:14.583 line:82%
How can we tell him, Lajoji?
Yash has warned us against it.

82
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.375 line:82%
Rohan was not even in town
when Rahul left home.

83
00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.458 line:82%
He doesn't know anything.

84
00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:23.042 line:82%
I think we should
tell him everything.

85
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.917 line:82%
Where do we begin?
What do we tell him?

86
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:30.500 line:82%
He doesn't even know that Rahul was
not born to Yash and Nandini.

87
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.875 line:82%
He was adopted.

88
00:10:48.208 --> 00:10:52.780 line:82%
Rahul was two days old when
Yash and Nandini brought him home.

89
00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:58.900 line:82%
His tiny footsteps made a place
in all our hearts.

90
00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:19.958 line:82%
He became Nandini's lifeline
and Yash's dream was fulfilled.

91
00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:24.792 line:82%
Nine years later,
when you were born,

92
00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:29.292 line:82%
we felt that our family was now complete.

93
00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:36.208 line:82%
I still remember
the astrologer saying that,

94
00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:39.042 line:82%
you fought destiny to be born.

95
00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:42.500 line:82%
You would be our strength.

96
00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:47.042 line:82%
Did brother Rahul know
that he was?

97
00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.340 line:82%
Rahul was eight years old
when he got to know.

98
00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:24.417 line:82%
That was when Yash decided that,

99
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.240 line:82%
the matter would never be mentioned
again in the house.

100
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.220 line:82%
Never again.

101
00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:34.420 line:82%
Rahul was our son.
The eldest son of the house.

102
00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:37.540 line:82%
It was a truth that could
never be changed.

103
00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:42.420 line:82%
But the fact was mentioned again.
Suddenly.

104
00:12:44.292 --> 00:12:49.880 line:82%
And that was Rahul's last Diwali
with this family.

105
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.000 line:82%
Last Diwali.

106
00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:17.542 line:82%
Oh Allah! Rohan baba,
you have become so fat

107
00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:19.100 line:82%
that nothing fits you anymore.

108
00:13:19.583 --> 00:13:20.820 line:82%
What's DJ? Say Daijaan.

109
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.833 line:82%
It's all your blessings

110
00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:44.917 line:82%
Whether smiles or tears

111
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:51.417 line:82%
We shall never part
Through smiles or through tears

112
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.440 line:82%
I feel you in every breath of mine

113
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.660 line:82%
My life is but under your shadow

114
00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:50.667 line:82%
I feel you in every breath of mine

115
00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:56.000 line:82%
My life is but under your shadow

116
00:14:56.917 --> 00:15:01.900 line:82%
I pray to thee as long as I live

117
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.792 line:82%
It's all your boons
Whether smiles or tears

118
00:15:07.292 --> 00:15:12.958 line:82%
We shall never part
Through smiles nor through tears

119
00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:59.260 line:82%
We light the lamps of love
At your feet

120
00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:05.060 line:82%
We see you everywhere
In everything we see

121
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.540 line:82%
Our lips chant

122
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.160 line:82%
No name but yours

123
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:39.040 line:82%
Our lips chant no name but yours

124
00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:44.080 line:82%
Let our hearts be filled
With nothing but your love

125
00:17:44.167 --> 00:17:49.220 line:82%
It's all your boons
Whether smiles or tears

126
00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:54.542 line:82%
We shall never part
Through smiles nor through tears

127
00:19:42.042 --> 00:19:45.333 line:82%
Hey Mom. How do you always sense
my presence much before I arrive?

128
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.250 line:82%
Rahul, just tell me one thing,
Emails, letters, faxes...

129
00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:34.750 line:82%
I sent you all of these and you
didn't reply to any. Very rude.

130
00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:36.917 line:82%
MBA is a tough job, Naina!

131
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.375 line:82%
Was it only MBA that kept you busy?
Or was there something else?

132
00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:42.833 line:82%
I mean someone else.

133
00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:45.667 line:82%
Well,it was more than just one.
You know me.

134
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.167 line:82%
-You stud you.
-Ya. Me stud me.

135
00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:52.375 line:82%
-Tell me Rahul.
-What do you think?

136
00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:54.875 line:82%
-I think...
-What do you think?

137
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.458 line:82%
-I think, Rahul...
-What do you think, Naina?

138
00:20:57.542 --> 00:21:01.560 line:82%
Rahul, I don't think anyone other than
me can waste her time with you.

139
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:04.542 line:82%
In any case what do you know
what to do with a girl.

140
00:21:05.042 --> 00:21:07.960 line:82%
Oh really?
Is this done with a girl?

141
00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:10.750 line:82%
-Stop it Rahul.
-Tell me.

142
00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:13.260 line:82%
Did you remember me at all?

143
00:21:13.458 --> 00:21:16.580 line:82%
-Should I tell you the truth or lie?
-Lie.

144
00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:20.792 line:82%
If I have to lie then I'd say I did not
miss you at all.

145
00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:24.000 line:82%
How sweet!
-Let's talk about you.

146
00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:26.625 line:82%
Are you still the same
or is some mad guy interested in you?

147
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.458 line:82%
-What do you think?
-I think...

148
00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:32.292 line:82%
What do you think, Rahul?

149
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.583 line:82%
-I think...
-What do you think, Rahul?

150
00:21:37.708 --> 00:21:41.042 line:82%
I think, Naina...
I will beat you to that door.

151
00:21:59.292 --> 00:22:01.125 line:82%
Yes, yes.
Don't you have to go to school?

152
00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:06.000 line:82%
Thank you. C'mon, eat this.
What's the score?

153
00:22:06.292 --> 00:22:09.083 line:82%
-104 for 6. Isn't that great?
-Damn good yaar. How many overs?

154
00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:16.320 line:82%
God, brother.
I think India is going to kill England.

155
00:22:16.708 --> 00:22:19.380 line:82%
Anything can happen
at the last minute.

156
00:22:19.458 --> 00:22:21.458 line:82%
You can't bank on them too much.
You never know with India, Rohan.

157
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.625 line:82%
Here, take this.
Out, out. Whats the big deal?

158
00:22:25.708 --> 00:22:28.000 line:82%
England was out of India in 1947.

159
00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:32.750 line:82%
Oh Allah,
what are these? Legs or?

160
00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:35.250 line:82%
He still hasn't learn
how to tie his shoe laces?

161
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.917 line:82%
So what? He's a child yet.
He'll learn.

162
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.500 line:82%
But if you don't allow him
to do it himself, how will he learn?

163
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.440 line:82%
Fatty.

164
00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:40.958 line:82%
Why did you come back from London?

165
00:22:42.792 --> 00:22:44.333 line:82%
What's happening here?

166
00:22:44.417 --> 00:22:47.167 line:82%
Mom you have over fed Rohan
and turned him into a pumpkin.

167
00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:51.125 line:82%
Yes, yes please laugh at me.
When I go away to the boarding school

168
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.840 line:82%
you will all remember me.
Nobody loves me.

169
00:22:53.917 --> 00:22:56.208 line:82%
By the way Fatty,
Mother loves me more than you.

170
00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:59.875 line:82%
-DJ, Just look at him.
-Calm down. He's jealous of you.

171
00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:05.220 line:82%
-Mom, I missed you.
-I missed you too, baby.

172
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.500 line:82%
You won't leave me again
and go, will you?

173
00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:11.542 line:82%
I won't, but promise me, you will not
feed me the way you, this pumpkin.

174
00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:16.460 line:82%
Nandini! Nandini!

175
00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:18.250 line:82%
Yes, coming.

176
00:23:19.667 --> 00:23:21.625 line:82%
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

177
00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:25.208 line:82%
Who will knot this tie?
-Can't you do even that without me?

178
00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:42.540 line:82%
Here, now you truly look like
Mrs. Yashvardhan Raichand.

179
00:24:12.167 --> 00:24:14.583 line:82%
This's for you my son.

180
00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:19.375 line:82%
From today, the Raichand Empire
belongs to you.

181
00:24:27.292 --> 00:24:30.333 line:82%
Sorry Dad.
That's your grandfather. Salute him.

182
00:24:55.917 --> 00:25:00.875 line:82%
You know Rahul,
thirty years ago he said,

183
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.708 line:82%
certain things to me in this chamber,
which I will now repeat to you.

184
00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:11.583 line:82%
He said life of fers you many
paths to choose from.

185
00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:15.250 line:82%
You must always choose
the one that is right,

186
00:25:16.542 --> 00:25:18.833 line:82%
the one where you don't have to bend
where you don't fall.

187
00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:21.792 line:82%
Never take a step in life

188
00:25:22.208 --> 00:25:25.583 line:82%
that will bring shame
to your family name or prestige.

189
00:25:26.917 --> 00:25:31.917 line:82%
Anyone can make money but earning
respect is not everyone's cup of tea.

190
00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:39.167 line:82%
I have not forgotten
his words till today.

191
00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:42.939 line:82%
I haven't forgotten till date.

192
00:25:45.208 --> 00:25:46.458 line:82%
Even you should not.

193
00:25:50.708 --> 00:25:53.917 line:82%
Promise me that you will follow
the traditions of the family.

194
00:25:57.375 --> 00:26:01.042 line:82%
Promise me that you'll never compromise
with the self-respect of our family.

195
00:26:05.042 --> 00:26:06.542 line:82%
I promise, Papa.

196
00:26:07.125 --> 00:26:09.125 line:82%
That I will always keep
the family name flying high.

197
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:17.083 line:82%
I promise you that I will always
keep you happy always, Papa

198
00:26:20.292 --> 00:26:22.250 line:82%
We have won.

199
00:26:29.542 --> 00:26:32.708 line:82%
Pooja, Pooja
-What happened?

200
00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:34.583 line:82%
We have won the match.

201
00:26:36.083 --> 00:26:39.250 line:82%
God, Sachin played so well.
100 runs not out.

202
00:26:42.083 --> 00:26:44.083 line:82%
Ok now listen, take care
of the shop I will be back.

203
00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:45.792 line:82%
Haldiram!

204
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.542 line:82%
What a game!
What a game! What a game!

205
00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:54.250 line:82%
What a game!! By the way
what game are we playing?

206
00:26:54.833 --> 00:26:57.750 line:82%
-India has won the match!
-Oh so we have won. How nice.

207
00:26:58.292 --> 00:27:00.083 line:82%
If you didn't know,
what were you dancing for?

208
00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:02.792 line:82%
I was dancing because all the laddoos

209
00:27:03.042 --> 00:27:05.042 line:82%
that my wife made
have been sold.

210
00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:07.000 line:82%
Sold out? How come?

211
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.083 line:82%
There was a customer who told me
he wanted to eat laddoos

212
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.500 line:82%
that would drive him crazy.

213
00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:15.125 line:82%
Eating her laddos can cure
people who are insane

214
00:27:15.208 --> 00:27:18.459 line:82%
and those who are normal become...
-Clean bowled!

215
00:27:18.917 --> 00:27:20.458 line:82%
-It was just a joke.
-Stop it now.

216
00:27:20.542 --> 00:27:22.083 line:82%
-Haven't even started it yet.
-Come on.

217
00:27:23.042 --> 00:27:26.083 line:82%
-Rukhsar!
-Stop shouting so loudly.

218
00:27:26.375 --> 00:27:28.500 line:82%
The groom's side has come
to see Rukhsar for marriage.

219
00:27:28.667 --> 00:27:30.779 line:82%
Sit down. Salute them.

220
00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:36.639 line:82%
Grand mom, wake up.
The bride has arrived.

221
00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:42.083 line:82%
Dear, Lord.

222
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.208 line:82%
Her face is bright like
the full moon.

223
00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:48.208 line:82%
She is just what I had imagined.

224
00:27:48.292 --> 00:27:51.667 line:82%
Well, it's not me. Its...
This is my daughter, Rukhsar.

225
00:27:52.167 --> 00:27:53.750 line:82%
What? Fever?

226
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.875 line:82%
Not fever, Mother,
she's Rukhsar!

227
00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:58.417 line:82%
Oh Rukhsar!

228
00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:04.917 line:82%
What happen?
-We have won the match.

229
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.958 line:82%
My daughter's very
quiet and introverted.

230
00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:10.542 line:82%
-We have won.
-Allah! What happened?

231
00:28:10.667 --> 00:28:12.167 line:82%
Quiet and introverted?

232
00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.417 line:82%
Incidentally, what is her age?

233
00:28:17.417 --> 00:28:18.917 line:82%
Hundred.
-Grand mom, she says,

234
00:28:19.292 --> 00:28:21.083 line:82%
-she's hundred years old.
-What? Nine years old?

235
00:28:21.167 --> 00:28:25.779 line:82%
She's going to turn twenty-one soon.
-Well, the blossoming of youth.

236
00:28:25.917 --> 00:28:28.875 line:82%
Actually we live in Lucknow.
But this is Chandni Chowk,

237
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:33.875 line:82%
I guess, anyway I forgot to tell you,
my son's name is Mr. Ashfaque.

238
00:28:34.583 --> 00:28:36.417 line:82%
-Sachin!
-Sachin?

239
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.083 line:82%
Sachin? In case there's
someone else in her life.

240
00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:40.208 line:82%
No! No! Please don't say such things.

241
00:28:42.083 --> 00:28:46.417 line:82%
It's her uncle Sachin.
her late uncle Sachin.

242
00:28:46.917 --> 00:28:48.167 line:82%
She was very attached to him.

243
00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:50.292 line:82%
She always remembers
him on happy occasions.

244
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.500 line:82%
Sachin.
Poor Sachin.

245
00:28:58.875 --> 00:29:03.125 line:82%
C'mon you girls,
I'll teach you a lesson.

246
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.833 line:82%
Oh God, Is everything alright?

247
00:29:05.167 --> 00:29:07.458 line:82%
Forget about me,
tell me what has she done this time?

248
00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:09.083 line:82%
Ask me what she hasn't.

249
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.125 line:82%
A nice wedding proposal
would have slipped out of our hands.

250
00:29:11.292 --> 00:29:12.333 line:82%
What?

251
00:29:12.542 --> 00:29:14.500 line:82%
Your blood pressure is high,
180 by 100.

252
00:29:14.792 --> 00:29:16.125 line:82%
You mean BP is high-why!

253
00:29:16.792 --> 00:29:18.750 line:82%
Yes, it's high
and it's 'why' because of you.

254
00:29:19.208 --> 00:29:21.250 line:82%
I have just increased the dosage.
Please get these medicines.

255
00:29:25.625 --> 00:29:28.083 line:82%
-Om Bhai, you must take care of yourself.
-This won't do.

256
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.583 line:82%
Yes, aunty, he just doesn't
take care of himself.

257
00:29:30.792 --> 00:29:32.792 line:82%
You just keep quiet.
I don't want to talk to you.

258
00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:35.958 line:82%
-Why?
-Why? What is Sayeeda saying?

259
00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:39.875 line:82%
I wasn't serious at all.
I was just joking.

260
00:29:40.833 --> 00:29:44.125 line:82%
That's surprising.
You have spoilt my two daughters.

261
00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:47.519 line:82%
Aren't they like my children too?
Anyway, leave all this aside.

262
00:29:47.792 --> 00:29:50.919 line:82%
The good news is that
they liked this mad girl.

263
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.359 line:82%
-They have accepted the proposal.
-They have accepted?

264
00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:56.458 line:82%
Didn't they see you properly?

265
00:29:57.667 --> 00:29:58.625 line:82%
Shut up!

266
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:01.042 line:82%
So you will leave us and go?

267
00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:03.333 line:82%
Some day all you girls have to leave.

268
00:30:03.792 --> 00:30:05.750 line:82%
No way am I leaving
my father and going anywhere.

269
00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:09.459 line:82%
-Even I'm not going.
-So then should I leave?

270
00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:11.119 line:82%
Why do you speak like this, father?

271
00:30:11.333 --> 00:30:13.417 line:82%
Some day you have to get married,
my child.

272
00:30:14.208 --> 00:30:16.167 line:82%
The only prayer
I have to the Lord is that

273
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.417 line:82%
the man you marry must
love you even more than I do.

274
00:30:20.875 --> 00:30:21.833 line:82%
C'mon.

275
00:30:22.667 --> 00:30:24.708 line:82%
I don't think such
a man exists in this world.

276
00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:26.167 line:82%
Am I not there?

277
00:30:28.375 --> 00:30:31.179 line:82%
You did not eat, dance or even talk
to anyone at the party tonight.

278
00:30:31.542 --> 00:30:33.375 line:82%
You didn't even tell me
how beautiful I look tonight.

279
00:30:33.458 --> 00:30:34.917 line:82%
You look very beautiful, Naina.

280
00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:39.292 line:82%
I'm sweet and I also lie very well.

281
00:30:42.958 --> 00:30:44.958 line:82%
Hey Naina, you look very beautiful.

282
00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:47.542 line:82%
Are you lying or telling the truth?
-What do you think?

283
00:30:48.875 --> 00:30:50.500 line:82%
I think...
-What do you think?

284
00:30:50.583 --> 00:30:52.125 line:82%
I think Rahul...
-What do you think?

285
00:30:52.458 --> 00:30:54.083 line:82%
Rahul, I think you should go now.

286
00:30:54.292 --> 00:30:56.625 line:82%
In any case I wasn't planning to come
with you. But thanks for the of fer.

287
00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:03.875 line:82%
Bye... I was lying to you.

288
00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:19.539 line:82%
What's happening, Mom?

289
00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:23.750 line:82%
Nothing much except planning
for Dad's surprise party.

290
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.959 line:82%
Nothing stays in this child's stomach.

291
00:31:29.125 --> 00:31:31.299 line:82%
That's because there's already
so much in there.

292
00:31:32.042 --> 00:31:34.667 line:82%
Rahul, how come you are back so early?

293
00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:37.542 line:82%
Mom, these society parties
are very boring.

294
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.667 line:82%
Really?

295
00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:42.099 line:82%
In that case you have not taken
after your father in these matters.

296
00:31:42.167 --> 00:31:45.333 line:82%
He used to love such parties

297
00:31:46.708 --> 00:31:49.259 line:82%
because there used to be
a lot of girls there.

298
00:31:50.125 --> 00:31:51.083 line:82%
Nandini.

299
00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:54.583 line:82%
He used to get very happy
watching those girls.

300
00:31:54.792 --> 00:31:58.899 line:82%
Nandiniji, if I hadn't
watched those beautiful girls,

301
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.333 line:82%
-how would I have found you?
-What did you do?

302
00:32:02.125 --> 00:32:04.539 line:82%
Your father brought Nandini's proposal.

303
00:32:04.875 --> 00:32:08.750 line:82%
When he saw her for the first time
he was very pleased.

304
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.739 line:82%
And said, he approved of her.

305
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.979 line:82%
But he said we would have
to ask for dowry.

306
00:32:17.583 --> 00:32:20.458 line:82%
He insisted that the girl should
bring from her parents' house

307
00:32:21.875 --> 00:32:24.000 line:82%
lots of love and a long,
long ladder.

308
00:32:27.167 --> 00:32:28.792 line:82%
It's a great tradition.

309
00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:31.333 line:82%
The elders of the house choose
their daughter-in-law.

310
00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:34.479 line:82%
-One can't trust these mad children.
-What?

311
00:32:35.458 --> 00:32:38.250 line:82%
No, Mataji, all that was then.

312
00:32:39.167 --> 00:32:42.583 line:82%
-These days everything has changed.
-Nothing has changed, Nandini.

313
00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:45.292 line:82%
But these days children make
their choices themselves.

314
00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:47.625 line:82%
Nothing has changed, Nandini.

315
00:32:47.708 --> 00:32:50.625 line:82%
-What I meant was...
-Nothing has changed.

316
00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:52.667 line:82%
-But...
-I said it, didn't I?

317
00:32:53.542 --> 00:32:54.917 line:82%
That's it!

318
00:33:05.208 --> 00:33:11.042 line:82%
Your beauty is going to steal
His sleep in the nights...

319
00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:13.250 line:82%
Shut up!
-You shut up!

320
00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:14.708 line:82%
Where is your Mr. Ashfaque?

321
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.417 line:82%
I haven't even seen him yet.

322
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.458 line:82%
Introduce him to me.
Let me see how he looks.

323
00:33:19.083 --> 00:33:20.833 line:82%
He is arriving from Lucknow today

324
00:33:20.917 --> 00:33:22.917 line:82%
and he will come to meet you
as soon as he comes.

325
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.958 line:82%
Tell me what you thought of him.

326
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.958 line:82%
Stop this coy bride act now.

327
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.667 line:82%
By the way,
what does he do in Lucknow?

328
00:33:28.917 --> 00:33:30.625 line:82%
-He is a poet.
-A poet?

329
00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:32.792 line:82%
Then I'll get along very well with him.

330
00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:34.500 line:82%
Really? Why?

331
00:33:34.958 --> 00:33:37.542 line:82%
That's because I write
a bit of poetry myself.

332
00:33:39.042 --> 00:33:41.625 line:82%
Oh great. Ustad Anjali Ali Khan.

333
00:33:41.875 --> 00:33:44.792 line:82%
-Let me say a few lines...
-Go on, go on.

334
00:33:45.583 --> 00:33:47.542 line:82%
What heartache have
I gone through for thee.

335
00:33:49.083 --> 00:33:51.042 line:82%
What heartache have
I gone through for thee.

336
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.979 line:82%
On one end is Rukhsar
and the other is Aunty...

337
00:33:54.083 --> 00:33:55.375 line:82%
Shut up, you brat.

338
00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:58.708 line:82%
Do you know that the morning papers
have carried a photograph

339
00:33:58.792 --> 00:34:01.519 line:82%
-of my boss and his son?
-Really? Can I see?

340
00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:04.042 line:82%
-Wash your hands first.
-Oh God!

341
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.417 line:82%
Tomorrow is his fiftieth birthday.

342
00:34:07.792 --> 00:34:09.750 line:82%
There's going to be a big party.
There will be lot of people.

343
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.750 line:82%
I made it very clear to Bhabhiji
that the desserts will come

344
00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:17.083 line:82%
from Chandni Chowk.
That too specially made by dear Anjali.

345
00:34:17.292 --> 00:34:19.542 line:82%
Really? And what did she say?
-She agreed.

346
00:34:19.792 --> 00:34:21.542 line:82%
But now you make sure that
you don't mess things up.

347
00:34:21.625 --> 00:34:23.750 line:82%
Both Rukhsar and you come
to the party with the
kulfi.

348
00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:27.159 line:82%
Yes we will. Oh God,
but tomorrow is Father's birthday too.

349
00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:29.333 line:82%
So what? Come a little late.

350
00:34:29.542 --> 00:34:31.500 line:82%
In any case their party
is not going to start early.

351
00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:34.779 line:82%
Oh Allah! Oh Allah!
Do I have it?

352
00:34:35.542 --> 00:34:37.500 line:82%
No!
-You don't know anything.

353
00:34:38.083 --> 00:34:39.708 line:82%
Please dress appropriately
for tomorrow.

354
00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:43.099 line:82%
Yes Ammi, I will wear my new shimmering,
embroidered outfit.

355
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.833 line:82%
of course, you must.

356
00:34:44.917 --> 00:34:46.542 line:82%
After all everyone in the party
will be dying to know

357
00:34:46.625 --> 00:34:49.042 line:82%
what Rukhsar is going to wear?
-Really?

358
00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:53.708 line:82%
-C'mon Rukhsar, the gang. Please.
-No, not today.

359
00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:55.958 line:82%
Rukhsar please.
-No, Ammi is not feeling well.

360
00:35:05.042 --> 00:35:06.333 line:82%
I'll return it.

361
00:35:07.708 --> 00:35:09.792 line:82%
Your groom is coming
to visit us today, isn't he?

362
00:35:13.792 --> 00:35:16.625 line:82%
Where have we come now? How tacky!

363
00:35:16.792 --> 00:35:19.458 line:82%
You brat. Mother has sent
some medicines for Daijaan.

364
00:35:19.875 --> 00:35:20.833 line:82%
I'll back.

365
00:35:29.292 --> 00:35:31.000 line:82%
Mother, stop it now and go to sleep.

366
00:36:40.208 --> 00:36:41.958 line:82%
-Come back.
-Coming, bauji.

367
00:36:47.292 --> 00:36:48.583 line:82%
Where has brother gone?

368
00:36:54.833 --> 00:36:56.792 line:82%
The shop's closed for now.
It will open only at 10.

369
00:36:57.833 --> 00:36:59.125 line:82%
Mr. Ashfaque miya.

370
00:37:13.708 --> 00:37:14.917 line:82%
Let me say a couplet.

371
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.875 line:82%
So what if the evil wishes harm
nothing can happen.

372
00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:24.059 line:82%
What happens?

373
00:37:24.958 --> 00:37:28.083 line:82%
The only will that triumphs
is the will of the Lord.

374
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.292 line:82%
Your turn.

375
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.375 line:82%
Look up there.

376
00:37:36.583 --> 00:37:38.750 line:82%
Laddoo, you can't enter Chandni Chowk.

377
00:37:38.875 --> 00:37:40.458 line:82%
-Why?
-Just...

378
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.708 line:82%
And if you want to enter,
you have to say this:

379
00:37:43.833 --> 00:37:45.792 line:82%
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in Chandni Chowk

380
00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:48.379 line:82%
in a silver spoon, some Sauce.
Say it fast.

381
00:37:48.667 --> 00:37:50.750 line:82%
What exactly am I supposed to say?

382
00:37:52.125 --> 00:37:54.292 line:82%
Never mind. You don't say.
Can I say another one?

383
00:37:57.958 --> 00:38:02.792 line:82%
Love is not an easy path,
understand ye all.

384
00:38:03.875 --> 00:38:08.542 line:82%
It's a trial by fire
to be crossed bravely.

385
00:38:11.917 --> 00:38:15.875 line:82%
Chandu's... spoon's... uncle...

386
00:38:19.917 --> 00:38:22.208 line:82%
You have come to meet me,
haven't you?

387
00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:26.750 line:82%
Not really,
I came to meet Daijaan.

388
00:38:28.917 --> 00:38:31.625 line:82%
So you call her
'Daijaan' lovingly?

389
00:38:32.208 --> 00:38:34.539 line:82%
of course.
She has brought me up.

390
00:38:35.792 --> 00:38:38.279 line:82%
She has brought you up?

391
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.239 line:82%
In that case even I must have
played in her lap.

392
00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:48.299 line:82%
Chandu's spoon... silver uncle...
Look up there!

393
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.042 line:82%
Catch him.

394
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.042 line:82%
-When's the wedding?
-Who's?

395
00:38:52.458 --> 00:38:55.319 line:82%
of course yours and hers.

396
00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:57.458 line:82%
How can I marry Daijaan?

397
00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.458 line:82%
You have a great sense of humor.
And you are cute too.

398
00:39:02.542 --> 00:39:04.919 line:82%
Brother, save me.

399
00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:08.125 line:82%
I'm going to tell Rukhsar that
I liked her Mr. Ashfaque.

400
00:39:11.167 --> 00:39:12.833 line:82%
Who is Mr. Ashfaque?

401
00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:17.458 line:82%
You are asking me
who Mr. Ashfaque is?

402
00:39:17.542 --> 00:39:20.999 line:82%
You have a great sense of humor.
You have a great sense of humor.

403
00:39:23.458 --> 00:39:25.417 line:82%
Do you know where
Sayeeda begum lives? No?

404
00:39:28.083 --> 00:39:29.667 line:82%
Do you know?
-What do I know?

405
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.042 line:82%
You seem to know everything.

406
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.792 line:82%
Do you know my Aunty?
Your would be mother-in-law.

407
00:39:33.875 --> 00:39:36.699 line:82%
Sayeeda Begum. Do you know
where she works?

408
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:39.279 line:82%
Big businesses of the big people.

409
00:39:39.708 --> 00:39:42.083 line:82%
Have you heard of the Raichands?
How could you have heard of them?

410
00:39:42.542 --> 00:39:45.208 line:82%
Their photo has appeared
in the newspaper today.

411
00:39:45.292 --> 00:39:46.708 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

412
00:39:46.799 --> 00:39:48.099 line:82%
-First class.
-Wow.

413
00:39:48.208 --> 00:39:49.542 line:82%
Have you seen it?
-No.

414
00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:51.583 line:82%
Then come with me,
I'll show you.

415
00:39:51.667 --> 00:39:53.458 line:82%
I don't read the newspapers.
-Here it is.

416
00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:56.208 line:82%
Yashvardhan Raichand, a big snob.

417
00:39:57.708 --> 00:40:02.000 line:82%
And this is his son. God!
He looks exactly like you.

418
00:40:02.083 --> 00:40:07.259 line:82%
Show me.
Mr. Ashfaque.

419
00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:11.167 line:82%
-I'm a dead duck...
-Not at all.

420
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.000 line:82%
You have a great sense of humor.
You have a great sense of humor.

421
00:40:14.083 --> 00:40:17.999 line:82%
Brother, I have some
goons running after me.

422
00:40:24.042 --> 00:40:25.500 line:82%
My younger brother.

423
00:40:31.417 --> 00:40:36.239 line:82%
Listen, you really do have
a great sense of humor.

424
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.208 line:82%
-Greetings. I'm Mr. Ashfaque.
-And I'm the Queen of Jhansi.

425
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.939 line:82%
Before I raise this toast to Papa,
I want to say something to all of you.

426
00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:39.739 line:82%
I had a dream since childhood.
A dream to be like Papa.

427
00:41:40.583 --> 00:41:42.875 line:82%
To walk like him, speak like him,
sit like him.

428
00:41:43.417 --> 00:41:45.917 line:82%
To do everything the way he does.

429
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.379 line:82%
Like the way he is
standing right now.

430
00:41:58.167 --> 00:42:01.125 line:82%
And maybe I will never be able
to do it because

431
00:42:01.208 --> 00:42:03.292 line:82%
there's no one in this world
like my Papa.

432
00:42:06.625 --> 00:42:11.339 line:82%
I know that someone up there
is happy with me to have

433
00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:16.399 line:82%
bestowed on me the right to say that
I am Yashvardhan Raichand's son.

434
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.000 line:82%
Say it proudly.

435
00:42:45.167 --> 00:42:49.417 line:82%
We just want to say to you that
we love you very much.

436
00:43:05.292 --> 00:43:07.208 line:82%
I'll just have a look.
Grandmother, you come with me.

437
00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:04.542 line:82%
Your gilded beauty shines through

438
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.019 line:82%
And so do your golden anklets

439
00:44:14.999 --> 00:44:19.759 line:82%
Your gilded beauty shines through
And so do your golden anklets

440
00:44:19.833 --> 00:44:24.292 line:82%
They tinkle in melody
To wound the hearts of millions

441
00:44:24.375 --> 00:44:27.239 line:82%
Your kohled eyes speak
A mysterious language

442
00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:30.208 line:82%
The immortal language of love

443
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.399 line:82%
Say "shava shava"
Friends say "shava shava"

444
00:44:46.779 --> 00:44:50.839 line:82%
My gilded beauty shines through

445
00:44:51.333 --> 00:44:54.583 line:82%
And so do my golden anklets

446
00:44:55.833 --> 00:45:00.599 line:82%
My gilded beauty shines through
And so do my golden anklets

447
00:45:01.417 --> 00:45:05.375 line:82%
They tinkle in melody
To wound the hearts of millions

448
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.083 line:82%
My kohled eyes speak
A mysterious language

449
00:45:08.167 --> 00:45:10.708 line:82%
The immortal language of love

450
00:45:12.708 --> 00:45:16.000 line:82%
Say "shava shava"
Friends say "shava shava"

451
00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:06.199 line:82%
My fair lady dance with me

452
00:46:06.619 --> 00:46:08.539 line:82%
Keep on dancing

453
00:46:23.708 --> 00:46:27.208 line:82%
Ever since I laid my eyes
On you for the first time

454
00:46:27.292 --> 00:46:31.208 line:82%
My heart beats faster every minute

455
00:46:31.292 --> 00:46:36.083 line:82%
What have you done to me?

456
00:46:36.199 --> 00:46:40.439 line:82%
Oh lord, what have you done to me?

457
00:46:40.792 --> 00:46:44.250 line:82%
Your sweet words
Make me weak in my knees

458
00:46:44.333 --> 00:46:48.333 line:82%
I think I'm falling in love with you

459
00:46:48.417 --> 00:46:53.000 line:82%
I will die without you

460
00:46:53.083 --> 00:46:57.219 line:82%
Oh God, I will die without you

461
00:46:57.458 --> 00:47:01.208 line:82%
Say "shava shava" friends
Say "shava shava"

462
00:48:00.917 --> 00:48:04.792 line:82%
May my last breath
Be at your feet

463
00:48:04.875 --> 00:48:08.625 line:82%
May my love for you
Surpass that of the Lord

464
00:48:08.708 --> 00:48:14.667 line:82%
May the Lord forgive me
May the Lord forgive me

465
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.250 line:82%
You are my heart
You are my soul

466
00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:25.279 line:82%
You are my heaven
You are my earth

467
00:48:25.375 --> 00:48:28.250 line:82%
What will I ever do without you

468
00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:33.500 line:82%
Oh lord, what will
I ever do without you

469
00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:50.458 line:82%
Say "shava shava"
Friends say "shava shava"

470
00:49:01.542 --> 00:49:06.167 line:82%
Your gilded beauty shines through
And so do your golden anklets

471
00:49:06.625 --> 00:49:10.958 line:82%
They tinkle in melody
To wound the hearts of millions

472
00:49:11.125 --> 00:49:13.208 line:82%
Your kohled eyes speak
A mysterious language

473
00:49:13.292 --> 00:49:16.125 line:82%
The immortal language of love

474
00:49:18.292 --> 00:49:21.958 line:82%
Say " shava shava "
Friends say "shava shava

475
00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:25.167 line:82%
That's enough now.
It's been too much.

476
00:50:33.799 --> 00:50:37.539 line:82%
Hey, what do you say?

477
00:50:41.139 --> 00:50:45.559 line:82%
Hey, what should I say?

478
00:50:50.959 --> 00:50:52.659 line:82%
-Listen up
-Speak up

479
00:50:53.099 --> 00:50:55.239 line:82%
Will you come to Khandala?

480
00:50:55.559 --> 00:51:00.259 line:82%
What will I do in Khandala?

481
00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:04.779 line:82%
We'll roam around and have fun

482
00:51:05.542 --> 00:51:08.417 line:82%
We'll roam around and have fun--

483
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.708 line:82%
What else will we do?

484
00:51:09.792 --> 00:51:11.417 line:82%
Enjoy, what else?

485
00:51:17.333 --> 00:51:19.833 line:82%
God, mad girl...
Come on now.

486
00:51:19.999 --> 00:51:21.439 line:82%
Please forgive me.

487
00:51:24.042 --> 00:51:25.119 line:82%
Sorry, Aunty.

488
00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:29.667 line:82%
I'm a dead duck...
I'm a dead duck...

489
00:51:35.083 --> 00:51:36.599 line:82%
Rukhsar, This one is--

490
00:51:42.839 --> 00:51:44.199 line:82%
Happy birthday.

491
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.417 line:82%
Excuse me Sir!

492
00:51:55.875 --> 00:51:58.667 line:82%
Sir, this is our Anjali.
She has come to apologize to you.

493
00:51:59.179 --> 00:52:00.219 line:82%
-Apologize?
-Yes.

494
00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:04.208 line:82%
That's not necessary.

495
00:52:04.708 --> 00:52:05.917 line:82%
Wait! Wait!

496
00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.792 line:82%
How can you say that, Sir?
She has caused such a big loss for us.

497
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:13.000 line:82%
She must apologize. And to tell you,
she is quite a madcap.

498
00:52:13.625 --> 00:52:15.899 line:82%
Even in her own house...
-Aunty! Can I speak?

499
00:52:16.125 --> 00:52:17.792 line:82%
Yes... go ahead... apologize.

500
00:52:20.139 --> 00:52:21.379 line:82%
Hello.

501
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:26.708 line:82%
You know, Sir,
when I listen to film songs,

502
00:52:27.125 --> 00:52:28.750 line:82%
I tend to get a little filmi.

503
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.458 line:82%
And that Khandala number
is one of my favourites.

504
00:52:34.875 --> 00:52:37.125 line:82%
-Shut up!
-What am I saying?

505
00:52:37.208 --> 00:52:39.208 line:82%
What did you want to say
and what are you saying?

506
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:42.458 line:82%
Apologize.

507
00:52:45.083 --> 00:52:47.250 line:82%
You?
Come on leave right now from here.

508
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.000 line:82%
-Me?
-No, no. Not you.

509
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:59.833 line:82%
Oh! Sir, I was responsible
for smashing your big pot.

510
00:53:00.333 --> 00:53:02.125 line:82%
-Vase.
-Yes, vase, whatever it was.

511
00:53:02.208 --> 00:53:03.958 line:82%
I'm ready to pay you the
money for it.

512
00:53:05.208 --> 00:53:06.875 line:82%
By the way how much
was it for?

513
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.833 line:82%
Now, I don't know.
Sayeeda, why don't you explain.

514
00:53:10.083 --> 00:53:12.583 line:82%
-Shut up!
-Shut up?

515
00:53:13.042 --> 00:53:15.208 line:82%
-This is all because of you.
-Because of me?

516
00:53:16.292 --> 00:53:20.000 line:82%
No, no, not because of you.
God, everything is going wrong.

517
00:53:23.708 --> 00:53:25.917 line:82%
You see, Sir...

518
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:30.333 line:82%
Father always says that no one becomes
small by asking for forgiveness.

519
00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:34.917 line:82%
And the one who forgives
owns a big heart.

520
00:53:35.542 --> 00:53:38.458 line:82%
-You have a big heart don't you, Sir?
-Now...

521
00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:41.542 line:82%
-So you have forgiven me?
-Yes, I have.

522
00:53:44.667 --> 00:53:48.359 line:82%
Big businesses of big people.
Ok I'll take your leave now.

523
00:53:49.167 --> 00:53:50.917 line:82%
Please say a big hello to Madam.

524
00:53:51.458 --> 00:53:53.417 line:82%
May the Lord protect.

525
00:53:54.859 --> 00:53:58.559 line:82%
Greetings. To you too!

526
00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:13.583 line:82%
Quiet now...

527
00:54:14.208 --> 00:54:19.167 line:82%
Pot... No. Not a pot.
A vase.

528
00:54:19.417 --> 00:54:20.917 line:82%
Sayeeda, take her now.

529
00:54:21.083 --> 00:54:26.279 line:82%
-Come on now. Come on.
-Not a pot. A vase. Sorry.

530
00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:34.208 line:82%
A pot!

531
00:54:36.833 --> 00:54:38.542 line:82%
Isn't this that Laddoo's school?

532
00:54:38.625 --> 00:54:40.458 line:82%
-C'mon lets go and hit him.
-Yes. C'mon.

533
00:54:40.719 --> 00:54:42.179 line:82%
Hey, all of you hurry up.

534
00:54:47.959 --> 00:54:50.919 line:82%
-Let's run.
-Hold them.

535
00:54:53.042 --> 00:54:57.139 line:82%
These are the same goons
I was talking about.

536
00:55:09.375 --> 00:55:11.083 line:82%
Hey, you speak Hindi, don't you?

537
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:31.708 line:82%
What? And you didn't do anything?

538
00:55:31.792 --> 00:55:33.875 line:82%
They were too many of them, Sis.
I couldn't do anything.

539
00:55:35.042 --> 00:55:37.542 line:82%
Here you roam around like a don.
What happened to you there?

540
00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:39.792 line:82%
-Oh! Sister.
-Oh! Sister.

541
00:55:39.875 --> 00:55:42.417 line:82%
But what was the need
for her to go into the school?

542
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.167 line:82%
Lord Almighty!
What are you saying?

543
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:46.917 line:82%
She just entered the school,
not murdered anyone.

544
00:55:47.375 --> 00:55:49.125 line:82%
What was the need for them
to say all those things?

545
00:55:49.208 --> 00:55:51.167 line:82%
If I was there I would have caught
each one of them and bashed them up.

546
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.333 line:82%
Yes. They have hurt my sister.

547
00:55:54.583 --> 00:55:56.542 line:82%
Let me meet that
Laddoo and that Fattoo...

548
00:55:56.719 --> 00:55:58.679 line:82%
They keep posing for covers and all.

549
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.583 line:82%
I vow on Sachin Tendulkar that
I don't hang them upside down...

550
00:56:00.667 --> 00:56:03.292 line:82%
in the middle of Chandni Chowk
I won't call myself Bauji's daughter.

551
00:56:03.833 --> 00:56:04.792 line:82%
Anjali!

552
00:56:04.875 --> 00:56:07.667 line:82%
You don't know, Father.
Rich in money but poor at heart.

553
00:56:07.958 --> 00:56:09.917 line:82%
Can never find place near the Lord--

554
00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:12.500 line:82%
That's a good line.
Did you write it yourself?

555
00:56:12.625 --> 00:56:13.625 line:82%
Yes.

556
00:56:16.625 --> 00:56:18.583 line:82%
Greetings to you.
-Greetings.

557
00:56:19.458 --> 00:56:22.125 line:82%
Anjali, they have come to our house
for the first time

558
00:56:22.208 --> 00:56:24.708 line:82%
get them something to eat.

559
00:56:24.792 --> 00:56:26.417 line:82%
I'm sure they have had
their meals before coming.

560
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.875 line:82%
Haven't you seen the size?

561
00:56:29.917 --> 00:56:31.917 line:82%
Don't worry sir we have eaten.

562
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.958 line:82%
How can you say that? I'll just
get you something in a minute.

563
00:56:34.042 --> 00:56:36.708 line:82%
No. No sir,
Please don't take any trouble.

564
00:56:36.792 --> 00:56:39.917 line:82%
And you also... don't bother.

565
00:56:42.167 --> 00:56:43.917 line:82%
-What's the name?
-Rohan!

566
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.333 line:82%
-Not yours, hers.
-Pooja.

567
00:56:45.542 --> 00:56:46.917 line:82%
You are a real Laddoo. Come on.

568
00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:56.417 line:82%
You must never hurt
anyone's feelings.

569
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.250 line:82%
Specially that of a young girl.

570
00:56:58.792 --> 00:57:01.417 line:82%
And not when she's so beautiful.
Come on, say sorry now.

571
00:57:04.292 --> 00:57:06.250 line:82%
Besides, someone has told me that...

572
00:57:06.917 --> 00:57:09.083 line:82%
Apologizing doesn't make anyone smaller.

573
00:57:09.667 --> 00:57:12.917 line:82%
And the one who forgives
owns a big heart.

574
00:57:15.208 --> 00:57:16.500 line:82%
Isn't it?

575
00:57:20.167 --> 00:57:22.125 line:82%
What are you looking at?
C'mon, apologize, Laddoo.

576
00:57:36.208 --> 00:57:39.958 line:82%
If those two can become friends,
why can't we?

577
00:57:40.208 --> 00:57:41.667 line:82%
-Friends?
-Yes...

578
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:44.333 line:82%
I just want to be friends with you.
Do you have a problem?

579
00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:49.279 line:82%
-Really?
-Friends? C'mon just do it.

580
00:57:51.583 --> 00:57:53.917 line:82%
I can't see your dad.
He went to get some food.

581
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.333 line:82%
Father is inside--

582
00:58:01.792 --> 00:58:06.458 line:82%
I'm telling you, Rukhsar,
there's something fishy going on.

583
00:58:07.125 --> 00:58:08.792 line:82%
-Anjali, you think he's...
-What?

584
00:58:09.708 --> 00:58:12.542 line:82%
-He is...
-Yes, even I think the same.

585
00:58:13.083 --> 00:58:14.333 line:82%
-Don't you think?
-Correct.

586
00:58:14.583 --> 00:58:18.208 line:82%
-Even you think the same, don't you?
-You are on the mark Rukhsar.

587
00:58:19.458 --> 00:58:21.625 line:82%
He wants to take away
my shop from me.

588
00:58:22.417 --> 00:58:23.375 line:82%
Oh Allah!

589
00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:26.625 line:82%
What do I do with this girl?
I'm saying that he might be

590
00:58:26.708 --> 00:58:28.292 line:82%
-in love with you.
-Love?

591
00:58:28.792 --> 00:58:31.458 line:82%
Wow, Rukhsar Begum,
you are really great!

592
00:58:31.667 --> 00:58:34.625 line:82%
You think all the girls in Delhi
that he will be in love with me?

593
00:58:35.375 --> 00:58:37.375 line:82%
No one loves me
here in Chandni Chowk.

594
00:58:37.583 --> 00:58:39.750 line:82%
Why would that Yashvardhan's
son be interested in me?

595
00:58:40.333 --> 00:58:42.083 line:82%
Don't joke it away now,
I'm telling you.

596
00:58:42.167 --> 00:58:44.125 line:82%
Ya, ya.
You keep telling.

597
00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:55.042 line:82%
-Take her away.
-What are you saying?

598
00:58:55.125 --> 00:58:56.833 line:82%
-It was a joke.
-Stop it.

599
00:58:58.458 --> 00:58:59.875 line:82%
So you don't want
to buy the sweetmeats?

600
00:59:02.042 --> 00:59:03.375 line:82%
When did it shift?

601
00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:05.167 line:82%
Red Fort shifted to Agra
a long time ago and...

602
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.042 line:82%
the mental asylum from there
has shifted here.

603
00:59:07.875 --> 00:59:10.542 line:82%
Not a dime in the pocket and wants to know
the whereabouts of the Red Fort.

604
00:59:14.833 --> 00:59:16.458 line:82%
Bharat Sweet Shop.
Sweets for all occasions.

605
00:59:16.542 --> 00:59:19.708 line:82%
-Whether an engagement or wedding.
-Both will happen in due course...

606
00:59:19.917 --> 00:59:21.333 line:82%
what's the hurry?
-Who's that?

607
00:59:21.542 --> 00:59:23.875 line:82%
Who? It's me, who else?
-Who's me?

608
00:59:24.042 --> 00:59:26.375 line:82%
What do you mean, who?
It's me your new friend.

609
00:59:29.167 --> 00:59:32.333 line:82%
You know, the children have made
a plan to go to the fair.

610
00:59:32.417 --> 00:59:35.458 line:82%
I was thinking if you could join us,
it would be great fun!

611
00:59:35.667 --> 00:59:36.583 line:82%
What fair?

612
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:38.708 line:82%
The fair at Chandni Chowk,
which else?

613
00:59:38.792 --> 00:59:41.458 line:82%
This fair?
Don't you think

614
00:59:41.542 --> 00:59:43.958 line:82%
it's importance would reach too high
if you visited this fair?

615
00:59:44.167 --> 00:59:46.917 line:82%
Actually, my importance will increase
manifold, if you could join me.

616
00:59:48.583 --> 00:59:50.625 line:82%
Tomorrow at 4 in the evening.

617
00:59:51.125 --> 00:59:52.750 line:82%
-Bye.
-Bye.

618
01:00:03.542 --> 01:00:06.042 line:82%
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in

619
01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:08.500 line:82%
Chandni Chowk in a silver spoon,
some Sauce. C'mon say it.

620
01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:09.750 line:82%
Stop it!

621
01:00:13.333 --> 01:00:16.042 line:82%
Wearing a suit and his boots
Kanhaiyya has arrived to play a band.

622
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.667 line:82%
Wow! You sing very well.

623
01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:22.000 line:82%
Yes. By the way,
do you always wear such clothes?

624
01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:24.708 line:82%
Yes. When I wear clothes,
I wear these.

625
01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:26.708 line:82%
Otherwise most of the time
I remain nude.

626
01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:29.417 line:82%
No, no. I asked because we have
a proverb that says,

627
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.792 line:82%
'He who wears a
kurta
from Lucknow
and Pathani
salwar,

628
01:00:31.958 --> 01:00:34.125 line:82%
stands for a true man and the one
who doesn't, who knows? '

629
01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:37.333 line:82%
Very good! By the way your hair
looks beautiful when left loose.

630
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:42.917 line:82%
Isn't it a coincidence that both
our fathers share the same birthday?

631
01:00:43.042 --> 01:00:45.500 line:82%
-Twins?
-Of course. One with a large heart...

632
01:00:45.583 --> 01:00:48.042 line:82%
the other with a large pocket
to pay the bills.

633
01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.875 line:82%
Let them be.
They look nice.

634
01:01:00.859 --> 01:01:01.979 line:82%
Bangles?

635
01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:05.833 line:82%
Fair are my wrists
Make me wear those green bangles

636
01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:09.000 line:82%
Make me yours, my beloved

637
01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:13.375 line:82%
You... Sorry, I mean Mr...

638
01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:15.125 line:82%
Don't be so formal.
Say 'you', makes me feel closer.

639
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.250 line:82%
Closer? This is getting too much.
Now listen to me Mr. Raichand...

640
01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:22.750 line:82%
-I want to say something to you.
-I'm listening.

641
01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:27.583 line:82%
What I want to say is that
I can't give you what you want.

642
01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:30.708 line:82%
-Why not?
-I just can't.

643
01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.292 line:82%
At least give it a try.

644
01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:34.708 line:82%
I can't give.
Father won't allow it.

645
01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.000 line:82%
I'll ask for it from your father.

646
01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:38.875 line:82%
Lord save me! Why would
Bauji give you our shop?

647
01:01:38.958 --> 01:01:42.458 line:82%
What's the big--Shop?
What shop?

648
01:01:42.917 --> 01:01:46.167 line:82%
-Our Bharat Sweetmeat shop, which else?
-What shop are you talking about?

649
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.250 line:82%
It was alright till friendship but
what is all this intimacy about?

650
01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:53.000 line:82%
You sneaked in my house.
Lord save me, even that is over.

651
01:01:53.083 --> 01:01:55.083 line:82%
After all there's a limit
to friendship, isn't there?

652
01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:58.083 line:82%
Shut up!

653
01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:03.042 line:82%
There are many bonds
other than friendship.

654
01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:08.959 line:82%
Bonds that we don't understand.
That we don't need to understand.

655
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.792 line:82%
I hope it's not hurting you.

656
01:02:13.042 --> 01:02:16.750 line:82%
Bonds that are nameless.
That are just to be experienced.

657
01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:20.292 line:82%
I hope it's not hurting you.

658
01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:23.250 line:82%
Bonds that don't
have any boundaries...

659
01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:27.958 line:82%
no limits.
I hope it's not hurting you.

660
01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:32.542 line:82%
Bonds that bind the
hearts together...

661
01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.667 line:82%
bonds of passion...
bonds of love.

662
01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:45.875 line:82%
Hurt you? Me too!

663
01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:51.899 line:82%
And one more thing...

664
01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:56.879 line:82%
I'm definitely going to take over
your sweetmeat shop!

665
01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:33.625 line:82%
The sun dims into twilight

666
01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:36.625 line:82%
The moon beams simmer brightly

667
01:04:01.208 --> 01:04:05.167 line:82%
I stand still as the earth
moves around me

668
01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:11.333 line:82%
The heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper

669
01:04:12.958 --> 01:04:17.625 line:82%
Is it the call of first love?

670
01:04:19.417 --> 01:04:25.250 line:82%
My love, is it the
call of first love?

671
01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:43.292 line:82%
The sun dims into twilight,
moon beams simmer brightly

672
01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:55.667 line:82%
I stand still as the earth
moves around me

673
01:04:56.917 --> 01:05:01.208 line:82%
The heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper

674
01:05:02.667 --> 01:05:07.583 line:82%
Is it the call of first love?

675
01:05:07.833 --> 01:05:12.583 line:82%
My love, is it the call
of first love?

676
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.167 line:82%
Savour these beauteous moments,
when everything changes

677
01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:06.583 line:82%
Our dreams blend into
the realms of reality

678
01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:14.292 line:82%
I wonder if our love,
travelling through centuries...

679
01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:19.500 line:82%
has bound us in its silken threads

680
01:06:20.292 --> 01:06:25.250 line:82%
Let this season of love
remain eternal

681
01:06:26.042 --> 01:06:31.375 line:82%
let us meet through lives
and lives, like today

682
01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:36.500 line:82%
I stand still as the earth
moves around me

683
01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:43.167 line:82%
the heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper

684
01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:49.833 line:82%
Is it the call of first love?

685
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:55.667 line:82%
My love, is it the call
of first love?

686
01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:44.750 line:82%
The colours of our souls
has melted into one

687
01:07:48.833 --> 01:07:54.542 line:82%
I can't say which of me is you
and which of you is me

688
01:07:57.792 --> 01:08:03.292 line:82%
O beloved, it's the waves
of the your love that drown me

689
01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:10.917 line:82%
before transporting me to the shore

690
01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:17.833 line:82%
It's the thirst of the ocean,
It's the dream of the night

691
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:23.542 line:82%
The hearts of the flames
have been set afire

692
01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:30.083 line:82%
I stand still
as the earth moves around me

693
01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:35.875 line:82%
the heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper

694
01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:40.833 line:82%
My love, is it the
call of first love?

695
01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:47.917 line:82%
My love, is it
the call of first love?

696
01:08:50.208 --> 01:08:55.379 line:82%
The sun dims into twilight,
moon beams simmer brightly

697
01:10:02.125 --> 01:10:04.917 line:82%
She's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely mad.

698
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:09.000 line:82%
She makes strange faces,
she talks a lot.

699
01:10:10.042 --> 01:10:13.000 line:82%
And she has some lovable mannerisms.

700
01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:17.000 line:82%
And wherever she goes
she breaks a vase a pot

701
01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:19.417 line:82%
-Pot?
-That's what she calls them.

702
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.333 line:82%
But whenever I'm next to her,
I don't know what happens to me.

703
01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:29.708 line:82%
But she's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely...

704
01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:30.917 line:82%
Mad.

705
01:10:34.167 --> 01:10:35.917 line:82%
What's the name
of this mad hatter?

706
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.583 line:82%
I wanted to know your opinion.

707
01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:45.083 line:82%
I'm very happy with this alliance.
Naina is a very nice girl.

708
01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:47.625 line:82%
Have you spoken to Rahul
about this?

709
01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:51.125 line:82%
What's the need to speak to Rahul?
He can't take these family decisions.

710
01:10:51.208 --> 01:10:55.000 line:82%
Naina will be the daughter-in-law
of this house. Our house!

711
01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:03.250 line:82%
DJ, who will do all this for me there?

712
01:11:22.958 --> 01:11:25.917 line:82%
Dad, Why can't I stay with
all of you here?

713
01:11:27.042 --> 01:11:29.458 line:82%
Why are you sending me
to the boarding school?

714
01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:32.667 line:82%
Traditions, my child.
Traditions.

715
01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:36.708 line:82%
Your grandfather went there,
I did, so did your brother.

716
01:11:37.708 --> 01:11:39.333 line:82%
You can't break the traditions
of the house, can you?

717
01:11:39.417 --> 01:11:40.375 line:82%
No...

718
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:54.708 line:82%
Always remember
one more thing...

719
01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:57.083 line:82%
Mom loves me more than
she loves you.

720
01:12:18.708 --> 01:12:21.458 line:82%
You have given me so much already.
I can't take all these.

721
01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:25.292 line:82%
Sayeeda, if Rahul and Rohan
can be like your sons,

722
01:12:25.917 --> 01:12:27.875 line:82%
then don't have a right
over your daughter?

723
01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:30.792 line:82%
Of course you have.
But all this is too much.

724
01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:34.542 line:82%
Just tell me what time
is the actual wedding?

725
01:12:35.899 --> 01:12:36.899 line:82%
Sir has arrived.

726
01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:39.250 line:82%
Rohan, listen to me carefully.

727
01:12:43.083 --> 01:12:44.625 line:82%
Take care of your food and sleep.

728
01:12:44.958 --> 01:12:46.708 line:82%
Rohan, he has reached
his school.

729
01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.333 line:82%
Hey! What's all this?

730
01:12:50.167 --> 01:12:52.319 line:82%
Tomorrow is Rukhsar's wedding.
So the two of us...

731
01:12:52.599 --> 01:12:55.042 line:82%
Congratulations to you, Sayeeda!

732
01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:57.708 line:82%
-If you need anything just ask for it.
-Thank you sir...

733
01:12:57.833 --> 01:12:59.958 line:82%
I'd be very happy if you and Ma'am
could attend the wedding tomorrow...

734
01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.375 line:82%
I have asked Rahul to attend the wedding,
he will be there.

735
01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:06.333 line:82%
OK.

736
01:13:11.292 --> 01:13:12.958 line:82%
Rahul baba must have come now.

737
01:13:13.042 --> 01:13:14.833 line:82%
Let me just check.
I'll just be back.

738
01:13:27.417 --> 01:13:28.708 line:82%
Listen to me.

739
01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.625 line:82%
Tomorrow is a big day for Sayeeda.

740
01:13:34.125 --> 01:13:38.667 line:82%
-I think we should go too...
-How can we go there, Nandini?

741
01:13:39.125 --> 01:13:44.000 line:82%
-I can understand, but still we...
-We cannot go there.

742
01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:50.875 line:82%
-Please think about it again...
-I said it, didn't I? That's it!

743
01:14:10.438 --> 01:14:14.978 line:82%
I have nine bangles on my wrist

744
01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:19.625 line:82%
Please wait my love
There are many obstacles

745
01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:24.417 line:82%
We'll be one
But only after this night

746
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.958 line:82%
What happened to Chandni?

747
01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:32.375 line:82%
-Haldiram, What happened?
-What happened?

748
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:55.083 line:82%
Listen, let me say a couplet.

749
01:14:56.042 --> 01:14:58.583 line:82%
"Neither the
Kurta
from Lucknow
nor a
Pathani Salwar
maketh a man.

750
01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:01.250 line:82%
He who gives away his heart
stands for a true man.

751
01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:03.167 line:82%
And the one who doesn't is useless."

752
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.708 line:82%
"Oh the brides decorated hands"

753
01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:20.917 line:82%
"Oh the brides bejewelled finery"

754
01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:24.208 line:82%
"Oh she looks like a floral ornament"

755
01:15:26.292 --> 01:15:27.958 line:82%
"Oh the brides kohled eyes"

756
01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.333 line:82%
Oh she looks the most beautiful
of them all

757
01:15:53.042 --> 01:15:55.167 line:82%
Oh the bridesmaid...

758
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.208 line:82%
She looks like a silken thread

759
01:15:59.833 --> 01:16:03.958 line:82%
she peeps from behind,
and steals a glance

760
01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:20.250 line:82%
Whether she admits it or nay,
she's stolen my heart

761
01:16:20.792 --> 01:16:22.625 line:82%
Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord

762
01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:38.417 line:82%
These lanes of my childhood,
I shall never depart

763
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.375 line:82%
Put some sense,
into this crazy man's head

764
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.875 line:82%
He is hurling himself onto me

765
01:16:57.542 --> 01:16:59.708 line:82%
Oh lord, this young man oh my lord

766
01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:31.500 line:82%
Whether thy lips speak or not...

767
01:17:31.875 --> 01:17:33.875 line:82%
your eyes divulge the story

768
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:38.208 line:82%
You can't hide love in disdain...

769
01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:42.583 line:82%
you can't hide love in disdain...

770
01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:47.458 line:82%
A veiled silence speaks
more than a thousand words

771
01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:52.000 line:82%
Words don't always
do justice, my friend

772
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.292 line:82%
What's in the heart,
only the heart knows

773
01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:56.917 line:82%
Or then the lord

774
01:17:57.292 --> 01:18:01.698 line:82%
Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord

775
01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:05.417 line:82%
Oh my lord,
this young man, oh my lord

776
01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:45.458 line:82%
You can't demand,
a hand in bethrotal

777
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.083 line:82%
pairs are ordained,
already in heaven

778
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:54.292 line:82%
Pairs are ordained,
already in heaven

779
01:18:55.167 --> 01:18:59.458 line:82%
Leading a wedding procession,
I will take you from your doorstep

780
01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:03.958 line:82%
It's been destined so,

781
01:19:04.518 --> 01:19:09.058 line:82%
Oh go away and stop day dreaming

782
01:19:09.125 --> 01:19:12.792 line:82%
Oh my lord,
this young man, oh my lord

783
01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:21.625 line:82%
Oh the bridesmaid...
she looks like a silken thread

784
01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:26.667 line:82%
She peeps from behind,
and steals a glance

785
01:19:27.518 --> 01:19:30.838 line:82%
These lanes of my childhood,
I shall never depart

786
01:19:32.078 --> 01:19:36.318 line:82%
Put some sense,
into this crazy man's head

787
01:19:36.792 --> 01:19:41.042 line:82%
Whether she admits it or nay,
she's stolen my heart

788
01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:47.625 line:82%
Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord

789
01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:52.750 line:82%
Oh lord,
this young man oh my lord

790
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.583 line:82%
Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord

791
01:19:59.125 --> 01:20:00.375 line:82%
Agreed!

792
01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:05.125 line:82%
Agreed!

793
01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:26.292 line:82%
-Agreed!
-Even I agree.

794
01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:33.625 line:82%
-You love her don't you?
-Yes, Papa.

795
01:20:34.667 --> 01:20:36.478 line:82%
Didn't I tell you, Nandini?
What did I tell you?

796
01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:41.417 line:82%
I'm very happy,
today Rahul... very happy.

797
01:20:42.208 --> 01:20:44.208 line:82%
Just promise me that
you will keep her happy too.

798
01:20:44.708 --> 01:20:46.292 line:82%
You will keep my daughter-in-law
very happy.

799
01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:48.250 line:82%
You will keep Naina very happy.

800
01:21:11.042 --> 01:21:13.000 line:82%
You face has fallen as
if we are already married.

801
01:21:14.583 --> 01:21:16.875 line:82%
By the way this expression appears
only after a man gets married.

802
01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:23.000 line:82%
Rahul, what's the matter?

803
01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:26.833 line:82%
What's her name?

804
01:21:27.708 --> 01:21:28.875 line:82%
Naina!

805
01:21:29.917 --> 01:21:32.750 line:82%
I wish that was the name.
But it isn't.

806
01:21:37.542 --> 01:21:39.125 line:82%
-Naina... it's just...
-Rahul!

807
01:21:41.042 --> 01:21:43.958 line:82%
Ever since I can remember
I have loved you...

808
01:21:44.583 --> 01:21:49.208 line:82%
Loved you very much.
But it isn't your fault.

809
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.875 line:82%
Just because I dreamt of marrying you
doesn't mean you have to marry me.

810
01:21:57.542 --> 01:22:01.125 line:82%
And if you are worried
that I will miserable

811
01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:02.875 line:82%
Yes I will be.

812
01:22:03.083 --> 01:22:04.750 line:82%
I will feel very bad.
It will hurt.

813
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.250 line:82%
A lot too.
But life doesn't stop, does it Rahul?

814
01:22:11.625 --> 01:22:15.167 line:82%
Perhaps a few years from now
I can laugh at the fact that

815
01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:19.625 line:82%
I loved a certain Rahul
who could not become mine.

816
01:22:20.917 --> 01:22:26.542 line:82%
Because he was never mine!
And my love story remained incomplete.

817
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.917 line:82%
But do me a favour, Rahul.

818
01:22:35.938 --> 01:22:38.000 line:82%
Please complete your love story.

819
01:22:40.125 --> 01:22:42.625 line:82%
You will, won't you, Rahul?
For my sake.

820
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:50.818 line:82%
Now say something quickly
before I cry more.

821
01:22:53.417 --> 01:22:54.708 line:82%
Even me.

822
01:23:16.583 --> 01:23:17.833 line:82%
Raichand.

823
01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:26.167 line:82%
The name and the respect has been
given to us by our ancestors.

824
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:34.583 line:82%
To honour and respect them
is our foremost duty.

825
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:41.292 line:82%
And I will never tolerate
an ordinary girl becoming a hurdle

826
01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:44.792 line:82%
in performing that duty.

827
01:23:48.333 --> 01:23:50.158 line:82%
You didn't even think once

828
01:23:52.417 --> 01:23:58.167 line:82%
about the background of the girl,
her status, her breeding.

829
01:24:00.875 --> 01:24:03.750 line:82%
You didn't give a thought to whether
the girl will be able to understand

830
01:24:03.833 --> 01:24:05.500 line:82%
our culture, our traditions.

831
01:24:07.583 --> 01:24:09.625 line:82%
Will the girl ever understand
our rituals, our rites?

832
01:24:11.333 --> 01:24:13.917 line:82%
Will the girl understand
our ethics and principles?

833
01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:17.542 line:82%
Will she adhere to the values
of our family?

834
01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:18.708 line:82%
Will she?

835
01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:25.167 line:82%
How did you even dare to think
that she can be a part of our family?

836
01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:30.083 line:82%
That she can be a part of my family?

837
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.167 line:82%
How did you think?

838
01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:42.542 line:82%
Where did I think, Papa?
I didn't think at all.

839
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:51.375 line:82%
I just loved... Love.

840
01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:54.208 line:82%
Love?

841
01:25:01.625 --> 01:25:06.208 line:82%
It's such a pity that. I made
a mistake in knowing my own son

842
01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:11.583 line:82%
I thought he knew me.

843
01:25:14.417 --> 01:25:16.375 line:82%
That he understands
the traditions of this family.

844
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.708 line:82%
He understands my emotions,
he understands every breath of mine.

845
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.667 line:82%
I was so wrong. So wrong.

846
01:25:37.417 --> 01:25:39.375 line:82%
I was really proud of you.

847
01:25:40.208 --> 01:25:42.958 line:82%
You were my self-respect.
You were my strength.

848
01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:53.218 line:82%
You have taken all that away
from me. Everything.

849
01:25:59.333 --> 01:26:00.875 line:82%
You have hurt me.

850
01:26:05.833 --> 01:26:07.625 line:82%
You have hurt me.

851
01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:41.792 line:82%
I never wanted to hurt you.

852
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.958 line:82%
I only wanted to bring you happiness.

853
01:26:49.667 --> 01:26:51.458 line:82%
What have I done?

854
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:57.208 line:82%
How could I bring tears to your eyes?

855
01:26:59.667 --> 01:27:01.542 line:82%
How could I bring tears?

856
01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.333 line:82%
Don't ever forgive me.

857
01:27:09.125 --> 01:27:11.583 line:82%
Please don't say that
I have hurt you.

858
01:27:13.417 --> 01:27:15.250 line:82%
Don't forgive me.

859
01:27:17.542 --> 01:27:20.167 line:82%
I will do as you say
just as you say.

860
01:28:07.958 --> 01:28:09.417 line:82%
Lord's name is the only truth.

861
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.638 line:82%
Father... Father...

862
01:28:11.917 --> 01:28:15.875 line:82%
Please don't leave us and go.
We'll be left all alone.

863
01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:19.338 line:82%
Get up, Father.
Don't leave us, Father.

864
01:28:55.125 --> 01:28:57.792 line:82%
Will the girl be able to understand
our culture, our traditions?

865
01:28:57.958 --> 01:29:00.000 line:82%
Will the girl ever understand our
rituals, our rites?

866
01:29:00.083 --> 01:29:02.667 line:82%
Will the girl understand
our ethics and principles?

867
01:29:02.792 --> 01:29:04.792 line:82%
Will she adhere to the values
of our family?

868
01:30:43.583 --> 01:30:44.958 line:82%
Today...

869
01:30:51.375 --> 01:30:56.875 line:82%
Today you have proved that
you are not my blood.

870
01:31:13.375 --> 01:31:14.750 line:82%
You are not my blood.

871
01:31:20.833 --> 01:31:25.832 line:82%
You have proved that

872
01:31:29.625 --> 01:31:30.625 line:82%
you are not mine.

873
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:35.208 line:82%
Papa!

874
01:31:37.708 --> 01:31:39.833 line:82%
You have lost the right
to call me that!

875
01:31:47.417 --> 01:31:49.208 line:82%
Made me a stranger in a moment.

876
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.292 line:82%
Made me a stranger in just a moment.

877
01:32:27.833 --> 01:32:30.167 line:82%
Does that mean I have no place
in this house anymore?

878
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:30.208 line:82%
I am right. Am I not, Mother?

879
01:33:37.292 --> 01:33:39.250 line:82%
I'm right, am I not?

880
01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:46.498 line:82%
Then let me go.

881
01:33:51.078 --> 01:33:51.938 line:82%
Can I go?

882
01:33:58.875 --> 01:34:01.583 line:82%
Through smiles or through tears

883
01:34:01.667 --> 01:34:07.625 line:82%
We shall never part
Through smiles nor through tears

884
01:34:27.875 --> 01:34:33.042 line:82%
My blessings live with you

885
01:34:33.917 --> 01:34:39.167 line:82%
To protect you from evil eyes

886
01:34:58.333 --> 01:35:03.083 line:82%
My wishes for you

887
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:07.208 line:82%
Wherever you go

888
01:35:10.542 --> 01:35:15.833 line:82%
May happiness and joy
Kiss your feet forever

889
01:35:16.292 --> 01:35:18.917 line:82%
It's all your blessings

890
01:35:58.625 --> 01:36:03.798 line:82%
Promise me that you will never let
tears come to his eyes

891
01:36:05.458 --> 01:36:06.438 line:82%
Promise me.

892
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:22.083 line:82%
Now go!

893
01:36:26.583 --> 01:36:28.458 line:82%
Rahul, we didn't take
blessings from father.

894
01:36:29.458 --> 01:36:34.258 line:82%
We don't have father's blessings.
Rahul we didn't.

895
01:36:54.667 --> 01:36:58.417 line:82%
Go, Sayeeda.
Go with my son.

896
01:36:59.417 --> 01:37:00.917 line:82%
Wherever he goes...

897
01:37:03.167 --> 01:37:05.958 line:82%
I don't want him to miss the warmth
of a mother's affection.

898
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:10.625 line:82%
If you want to be someone in life,
if you want to achieve something.

899
01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:14.333 line:82%
If you want to win,
always listen to your heart.

900
01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:18.833 line:82%
And if even that doesn't
give you any answers...

901
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:24.375 line:82%
close your eyes and think of your parents.

902
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:30.448 line:82%
And then you will cross all the hurdles

903
01:37:31.667 --> 01:37:33.238 line:82%
all your problems will vanish.

904
01:37:33.958 --> 01:37:36.792 line:82%
Victory will be yours.
Only yours.

905
01:37:40.167 --> 01:37:42.083 line:82%
You will remember all this,
won't you Rohan?

906
01:37:42.583 --> 01:37:47.333 line:82%
Why are you going, Brother?
Why? Please don't go.

907
01:37:50.042 --> 01:37:55.667 line:82%
Promise me, Rohan that after today
you will never ask anyone...

908
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:58.417 line:82%
why I left and where I went...
promise me.

909
01:38:09.708 --> 01:38:12.083 line:82%
Take care of mother.

910
01:38:15.667 --> 01:38:17.667 line:82%
Get selected in the cricket team.

911
01:38:34.542 --> 01:38:37.542 line:82%
And thus Yash's ego
and Rahul's stuborness,

912
01:38:38.333 --> 01:38:42.958 line:82%
broke the family into two.
Broke the family into two.

913
01:40:26.208 --> 01:40:30.125 line:82%
I will bring you back Brother.
I will bring you home Sister-in-law.

914
01:40:30.792 --> 01:40:33.292 line:82%
To your home. Our home.

915
01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:42.792 line:82%
-Nandini...
-Yes?

916
01:40:46.708 --> 01:40:49.042 line:82%
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

917
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:17.917 line:82%
Where is Rohan?

918
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:20.708 line:82%
I don't know where he
left early this morning.

919
01:41:20.792 --> 01:41:24.042 line:82%
Greetings for Id.
-Greetings for Id.

920
01:41:24.167 --> 01:41:28.167 line:82%
Greetings to you too.
You are glowing.

921
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.167 line:82%
I feel so happy that you have come.
Greetings for Id.

922
01:41:30.708 --> 01:41:33.333 line:82%
-God! How big he has grown.
-Yes... Both have grown quite a lot.

923
01:41:33.417 --> 01:41:35.083 line:82%
-Stop it now...
-Just a joke.

924
01:41:35.208 --> 01:41:37.333 line:82%
-What's his name, Haldiram?
-Ghasitaram!

925
01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:42.792 line:82%
Hello! Salutations.
Greetings for Id.

926
01:41:43.125 --> 01:41:45.625 line:82%
-Greetings to you too.
-Recognise me?

927
01:41:49.667 --> 01:41:51.792 line:82%
-Well...
-I'm from... there.

928
01:41:52.167 --> 01:41:53.625 line:82%
Ok... yes yes.

929
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.708 line:82%
He's just spinning yarns. He's just
come to have some free drinks.

930
01:41:59.792 --> 01:42:02.875 line:82%
I don't seem to see your mother.
-That reminds me...

931
01:42:03.125 --> 01:42:05.542 line:82%
-What's the news about Anjali?
-They are all very well.

932
01:42:05.625 --> 01:42:08.792 line:82%
-I just spoke to them in the morning.
-Please give them lots of our love.

933
01:42:08.875 --> 01:42:12.250 line:82%
-Rukhsar!
-You all chat... l'll be back.

934
01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:18.250 line:82%
What a life Anjali is leading!
From Chandni Chowk to...

935
01:42:19.125 --> 01:42:22.083 line:82%
-Yes. From Chandni Chowk to?
-To...

936
01:42:22.292 --> 01:42:24.375 line:82%
-To... where?
-What where? Chandni Chowk?

937
01:42:24.458 --> 01:42:26.417 line:82%
-That's in Delhi.
-You said she went somewhere.

938
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:30.125 line:82%
-Where did she go?
-Brother... Where she went?

939
01:42:30.667 --> 01:42:34.292 line:82%
Where did she go?
-Where did she go? Where she went...

940
01:42:34.958 --> 01:42:36.750 line:82%
-Where did she go?
-Where did she go?

941
01:42:37.167 --> 01:42:39.417 line:82%
-Where-did-they-go?
-Where-did-they-go?

942
01:42:39.833 --> 01:42:42.542 line:82%
Didn't you say they went somewhere?
Probably America or somewhere...

943
01:42:42.625 --> 01:42:45.125 line:82%
Oh! Have they gone to America?

944
01:42:46.125 --> 01:42:48.708 line:82%
-But they didn't live there earlier.
-Exactly.

945
01:42:49.167 --> 01:42:50.917 line:82%
-Where did they live earlier?
-In Chandni Chowk.

946
01:42:51.125 --> 01:42:53.792 line:82%
-After that... Where?
-America... Didn't you just say?

947
01:42:54.292 --> 01:42:56.208 line:82%
-And in between?
-In between whom?

948
01:42:56.583 --> 01:42:58.417 line:82%
-In between the two...
-What is between the two?

949
01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:00.917 line:82%
-What is between the two?
-The place between the two...

950
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.958 line:82%
What's the place between the two?
What is he talking about?

951
01:43:03.542 --> 01:43:06.708 line:82%
-Wonder where these people come from.
-I'm trying to tell you, the place...

952
01:43:06.792 --> 01:43:08.917 line:82%
-What place are you talking about?
-What place? Where?

953
01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.583 line:82%
Silence! Come here.

954
01:43:14.358 --> 01:43:16.125 line:82%
Haldiram has lost his marbles.

955
01:43:16.398 --> 01:43:19.458 line:82%
She has gone to London.
Someday even I will go there.

956
01:43:31.125 --> 01:43:32.875 line:82%
You have just come back, son.
And you want to go away again?

957
01:43:33.167 --> 01:43:34.750 line:82%
I feel incomplete here, Dad!

958
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.958 line:82%
Why don't you study for MBA here?
There are a lot of universities here.

959
01:43:40.333 --> 01:43:44.292 line:82%
-Why do you want to go to London?
-Traditions, Dad. Traditions.

960
01:43:46.458 --> 01:43:49.125 line:82%
Grandfather went there, you did.

961
01:43:50.333 --> 01:43:54.583 line:82%
So did brother. So how can I break
the traditions of this house?

962
01:44:12.708 --> 01:44:14.667 line:82%
So what shall I bring back
for the mother?

963
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.000 line:82%
What does a mother's heart yearn for?

964
01:44:20.458 --> 01:44:24.417 line:82%
Mother's heart? It only yearns
for her son's happiness.

965
01:44:28.167 --> 01:44:34.083 line:82%
No matter where he is.
No matter how he is.

966
01:44:36.258 --> 01:44:37.498 line:82%
He should be just happy.

967
01:44:44.542 --> 01:44:48.398 line:82%
And a son's happiness
is in his mother's laughter.

968
01:44:49.958 --> 01:44:51.598 line:82%
Her smile.

969
01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.833 line:82%
Something that he isn't able to see.

970
01:45:00.458 --> 01:45:04.708 line:82%
I promise, Mother.
The laughter will return.

971
01:45:06.625 --> 01:45:12.208 line:82%
That smile will return.
It's a son's promise.

972
01:45:18.125 --> 01:45:19.833 line:82%
And a brother's!

973
01:45:41.583 --> 01:45:45.833 line:82%
Your heart aches when your dear ones
go far distances, doesn't it?

974
01:45:55.208 --> 01:45:57.458 line:82%
And when dear ones create distances
in between, it aches even more.

975
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.292 line:82%
-Has your princess woken up?
-Oh yes, Pooja!

976
01:49:30.167 --> 01:49:33.125 line:82%
No one knows her by that name.
Call her what she is called by everyone.

977
01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:34.583 line:82%
Poo!

978
01:50:27.375 --> 01:50:31.333 line:82%
You have no right to look so beautiful.

979
01:50:39.583 --> 01:50:41.542 line:82%
She has arrived, the cunning vixen,
to drop her daughter.

980
01:50:43.042 --> 01:50:45.500 line:82%
After seeing your face in the morning
how can I call it a lovely day?

981
01:50:51.458 --> 01:50:53.833 line:82%
Liar! Liar! Come here...

982
01:50:59.375 --> 01:51:01.917 line:82%
-Who is it, Anjali?
-Your future daughter-in-law.

983
01:51:02.625 --> 01:51:04.583 line:82%
Come, let me serve you
some cornflakes.

984
01:51:25.167 --> 01:51:27.458 line:82%
-Anjali... Anjali I need to talk to you.
-What?

985
01:51:28.417 --> 01:51:30.708 line:82%
-This song that you sing every morning.
-So?

986
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:32.917 line:82%
It feels very nice.

987
01:51:35.958 --> 01:51:39.417 line:82%
But the neighbours around
were complaining.

988
01:51:39.833 --> 01:51:43.042 line:82%
I don't sing for them do I? I sing so
that my son learns about our country.

989
01:51:43.375 --> 01:51:47.000 line:82%
Our Krish has learnt everything.
Say that you have!

990
01:51:47.083 --> 01:51:49.042 line:82%
Yes... I have learnt everything.
-He has learnt nothing...

991
01:51:49.125 --> 01:51:51.417 line:82%
he knows nothing about our country.
Our religion, our traditions...

992
01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:54.333 line:82%
our heritage... Move out of my way.
Our country has...

993
01:51:54.417 --> 01:51:56.708 line:82%
Oh stop it Mummy!
What country? Country!

994
01:51:57.375 --> 01:52:00.333 line:82%
The country best in the world
is our India... Don't ever forget!

995
01:52:04.083 --> 01:52:07.125 line:82%
OK... I won't say anything.
He's already half an Englishman...

996
01:52:07.208 --> 01:52:09.458 line:82%
when he turns a full one
don't complain to me.

997
01:52:11.542 --> 01:52:16.125 line:82%
Yes... become just like her!
How do they say it? How do they talk?

998
01:52:31.458 --> 01:52:33.542 line:82%
Wouldn't it have been better
to have lived in Chandni Chowk?

999
01:52:50.125 --> 01:52:52.375 line:82%
Let me knot it for you, Jeej!

1000
01:52:55.083 --> 01:52:58.542 line:82%
-What happened?
-What kind of clothes have you worn?

1001
01:52:59.083 --> 01:53:01.042 line:82%
It's become too long hasn't it?

1002
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:05.417 line:82%
What now?

1003
01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.083 line:82%
Where's the back?

1004
01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:13.208 line:82%
Sis, don't wait for me.

1005
01:53:24.333 --> 01:53:27.417 line:82%
How do you allow Pooja to go out
wearing such little clothes?

1006
01:53:47.667 --> 01:53:50.000 line:82%
By the way even the two of you
are looking decent today, I think.

1007
01:54:36.375 --> 01:54:38.583 line:82%
You had worn this
even the day before, hadn't you?

1008
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:42.417 line:82%
It suits you a lot!

1009
01:55:03.167 --> 01:55:05.125 line:82%
Poo... The whole college
runs after Robbie.

1010
01:55:10.458 --> 01:55:12.167 line:82%
He's not my type!

1011
01:55:12.708 --> 01:55:15.667 line:82%
Who is your type?
And when will you meet him?

1012
01:55:18.042 --> 01:55:19.917 line:82%
He might meet me anywhere... anytime.

1013
01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.750 line:82%
He could be right here somewhere.

1014
01:55:28.625 --> 01:55:31.667 line:82%
Oh God! Who is this disturbing Poo
early in the morning?

1015
01:56:02.875 --> 01:56:06.958 line:82%
Who is this who hasn't turned
to give me a second look?

1016
02:02:02.792 --> 02:02:04.792 line:82%
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in Chandni Chowk...

1017
02:02:04.875 --> 02:02:06.667 line:82%
in a silver spoon,
some Sauce.

1018
02:02:09.083 --> 02:02:10.042 line:82%
Some sauce.

1019
02:02:27.417 --> 02:02:31.500 line:82%
Do you know Rohan, sister always says
that a married woman is the union

1020
02:02:31.583 --> 02:02:33.375 line:82%
of a wife and a daughter-in-law.

1021
02:02:34.542 --> 02:02:38.750 line:82%
She is a good wife, but she hasn't
managed to be an ideal daughter-in-law

1022
02:02:40.667 --> 02:02:43.917 line:82%
And your brother?
Not a day passes...

1023
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:47.000 line:82%
not a moment passes when he
doesn't remember his parents.

1024
02:02:48.042 --> 02:02:52.708 line:82%
But he never says anything. He has
put up their photograph in the house.

1025
02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:55.875 line:82%
But not once has he
turned towards it.

1026
02:02:58.292 --> 02:03:01.250 line:82%
We have made a small world
for ourselves here, Rohan.

1027
02:03:01.458 --> 02:03:05.250 line:82%
If you look from afar
it's filled with happiness...

1028
02:03:06.625 --> 02:03:10.167 line:82%
but the closer you go,
you will find a lot of sorrow.

1029
02:03:14.375 --> 02:03:18.208 line:82%
Why have you come, Rohan?
Why now?

1030
02:03:22.792 --> 02:03:28.717 line:82%
I had promised brother that I will
never ask where he went or why he went

1031
02:03:32.875 --> 02:03:37.375 line:82%
But today I have realized that
he doesn't think of us as his own.

1032
02:03:40.208 --> 02:03:43.833 line:82%
That is a pain i can't bear...
Can't bear.

1033
02:03:45.375 --> 02:03:47.542 line:82%
I have left some broken
bonds back home, Pooja

1034
02:03:49.542 --> 02:03:52.000 line:82%
that can only attain the status
of a family through my elder brother.

1035
02:03:55.083 --> 02:04:00.875 line:82%
I have come to take my brother back.
Take my sister-in-law back.

1036
02:04:03.833 --> 02:04:05.792 line:82%
But I can't do this on my own.

1037
02:04:08.708 --> 02:04:10.542 line:82%
I will need your support Pooja.

1038
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:16.708 line:82%
Will you support me?

1039
02:04:23.833 --> 02:04:29.208 line:82%
-No... No... Never!
-He is Sonia's brother.

1040
02:04:29.292 --> 02:04:32.542 line:82%
He's not my brother... And I didn't
even know that Sonia had a brother.

1041
02:04:32.708 --> 02:04:34.583 line:82%
So Sonia, when was this
brother of yours born?

1042
02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:36.292 line:82%
Brother? Who's brother?

1043
02:04:39.208 --> 02:04:41.167 line:82%
My first brother from India
has come.

1044
02:04:41.542 --> 02:04:45.833 line:82%
I mean first cousin.
He can't stay with me...

1045
02:04:55.333 --> 02:04:59.057 line:82%
It's only a matter of few days.
At least meet him once.

1046
02:05:01.625 --> 02:05:03.583 line:82%
My house isn't a charitable institution
that anyone can stay here.

1047
02:05:03.667 --> 02:05:06.177 line:82%
-Daijaan, please explain to her...
-Why are you troubling him? Why?

1048
02:05:06.292 --> 02:05:07.583 line:82%
Oh stop it Aunty.

1049
02:05:08.677 --> 02:05:10.777 line:82%
-C'mon, In such a big house can't he...
-Can't stay.

1050
02:05:10.977 --> 02:05:13.917 line:82%
This big house has you wearing
really small clothes... that's why.

1051
02:05:14.125 --> 02:05:17.500 line:82%
I don't want any young man staring at
you... And I'm the boss of this house.

1052
02:05:17.625 --> 02:05:19.708 line:82%
And I ring all the bells.
Gosh! What is it?

1053
02:05:20.697 --> 02:05:22.875 line:82%
What is it? I was just
saving you from an evil eye!

1054
02:05:23.057 --> 02:05:26.792 line:82%
Who's evil eye?
This whole family is mad.

1055
02:05:26.875 --> 02:05:29.833 line:82%
All the mad people from Chandni Chowk
have moved in here.

1056
02:05:32.625 --> 02:05:37.237 line:82%
Didi, Sonia's brother has just
arrived, he has no place to stay.

1057
02:05:38.317 --> 02:05:41.750 line:82%
Can't we give him a
small place in this big house?

1058
02:05:42.375 --> 02:05:44.458 line:82%
Pooja, You know Rahul, don't you?

1059
02:05:47.708 --> 02:05:50.542 line:82%
Didi, he has come from India.

1060
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:57.958 line:82%
-From India...
-My great India... remember?

1061
02:05:59.917 --> 02:06:01.917 line:82%
-Listen to me...
-No... no...

1062
02:06:02.542 --> 02:06:05.292 line:82%
Just listen to me...
he has come from India.

1063
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.958 line:82%
So? Should I make him sit on my head?
Do you know the population of India?

1064
02:06:09.042 --> 02:06:11.000 line:82%
If all of them shift here, where
will we sleep? Let me do one thing.

1065
02:06:11.083 --> 02:06:14.833 line:82%
I'll go to Heathrow and stand there to
invite everyone arriving from India...

1066
02:06:14.917 --> 02:06:17.542 line:82%
saying, 'Please come to my house.
My wife is mad! '

1067
02:06:21.042 --> 02:06:23.208 line:82%
He is coming today,
he's coming now, right now!

1068
02:06:24.333 --> 02:06:26.417 line:82%
He is waiting outside and
I'm calling him in...

1069
02:06:30.875 --> 02:06:31.833 line:82%
Listen...

1070
02:06:34.792 --> 02:06:35.750 line:82%
Excuse me...

1071
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:50.677 line:82%
"We shall never part,
through smiles nor through tears..."

1072
02:06:52.292 --> 02:06:56.250 line:82%
"we shall never part,
through smiles nor through tears."

1073
02:07:14.792 --> 02:07:20.237 line:82%
"How helpless are we,
what is this trial by fire..."

1074
02:07:20.792 --> 02:07:26.417 line:82%
"we stand so close
yet we are so far"

1075
02:07:27.417 --> 02:07:30.833 line:82%
"yourself are the body,
I am the soul."

1076
02:07:33.250 --> 02:07:36.542 line:82%
"I'm your blood..."

1077
02:07:39.167 --> 02:07:41.958 line:82%
"we meet and yet we don't..."

1078
02:07:42.042 --> 02:07:45.037 line:82%
"Oh what an illusion."

1079
02:07:45.125 --> 02:07:50.792 line:82%
"It's all your blessings,
whether smiles or tears..."

1080
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:56.897 line:82%
"we shall never part,
through smiles or through tears."

1081
02:08:15.792 --> 02:08:17.057 line:82%
My name is Rahul.

1082
02:08:23.250 --> 02:08:24.958 line:82%
My name is Yash.

1083
02:08:39.708 --> 02:08:44.097 line:82%
He will stay with us.
Take his luggage...

1084
02:09:26.333 --> 02:09:28.583 line:82%
And this is your room!

1085
02:09:34.583 --> 02:09:38.250 line:82%
And listen...
if you ever need anything...

1086
02:09:39.458 --> 02:09:42.957 line:82%
want anything...
don't bother asking me for it!

1087
02:09:46.250 --> 02:09:48.875 line:82%
-Listen...
-What is it?

1088
02:10:01.375 --> 02:10:04.333 line:82%
if you want to live in this house
you will have to follow the rules...

1089
02:10:04.625 --> 02:10:07.917 line:82%
and regulations of the house.
No coming late and try and...

1090
02:10:08.125 --> 02:10:12.617 line:82%
leave as soon as possible.
Dinner at 8 pm. Or starve the night

1091
02:10:12.875 --> 02:10:15.708 line:82%
And... stay away...

1092
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:24.177 line:82%
This is too much... Eh!
What are you staring at?

1093
02:10:25.375 --> 02:10:29.083 line:82%
-Say more, Please... it feels nice.
-Eh! Feels nice? Am I singing a song?

1094
02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:32.417 line:82%
Why do you keep calling me
Eh'? I have a name...

1095
02:10:34.083 --> 02:10:37.625 line:82%
-I know, but I can't say it.
-Why can't you say it?

1096
02:10:38.292 --> 02:10:41.042 line:82%
-I said, that I can't say it. Didn't I?
-Oh!

1097
02:10:41.125 --> 02:10:45.137 line:82%
So you don't want to take my name
as a sign of respect. That's great.

1098
02:10:45.458 --> 02:10:47.417 line:82%
In that case I should return
the respect too.

1099
02:10:47.542 --> 02:10:50.477 line:82%
-Can I call you Brother?
-Call your father that!

1100
02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:55.208 line:82%
Don't you drag my father into this...
actually you can... you have the right

1101
02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:02.417 line:82%
He got scared! Poo,
I think this one's a little...

1102
02:11:07.708 --> 02:11:09.977 line:82%
I'm mad? You wear this jacket.

1103
02:11:10.877 --> 02:11:13.297 line:82%
Lets go from here.

1104
02:11:18.708 --> 02:11:21.500 line:82%
Rohan, we were waiting for
your call for such a long time.

1105
02:11:28.125 --> 02:11:30.750 line:82%
Seems like both of you
are right here with me.

1106
02:11:34.792 --> 02:11:35.750 line:82%
Mad!

1107
02:11:36.125 --> 02:11:38.917 line:82%
The campus is giving me
an accommodation after a week.

1108
02:11:39.125 --> 02:11:41.037 line:82%
Right now I'm living with
an Indian family.

1109
02:11:41.875 --> 02:11:43.875 line:82%
Why, an Indian family?

1110
02:11:44.125 --> 02:11:47.250 line:82%
They are very nice people.
When I met them I felt like...

1111
02:11:47.333 --> 02:11:50.317 line:82%
I have known them for years.
A laughing, happy and...

1112
02:11:50.417 --> 02:11:54.042 line:82%
contented family,
like we are... we were...

1113
02:12:06.667 --> 02:12:12.167 line:82%
Is he going to pay for the bill?
Go eat your food... even that's free...

1114
02:12:28.667 --> 02:12:30.625 line:82%
There goes Madonna
early in the morning.

1115
02:12:37.708 --> 02:12:40.167 line:82%
if you are here, who is singing
this prayer in the morning?

1116
02:12:41.083 --> 02:12:43.375 line:82%
Goddess Saraswati herself
has incarnated in the house?

1117
02:12:49.625 --> 02:12:51.583 line:82%
What has happened to
Saraswati here?

1118
02:13:56.375 --> 02:13:58.625 line:82%
Look what we have done, Pooja?
We have woken them up so early.

1119
02:13:59.042 --> 02:14:00.375 line:82%
Come on... take their blessings.

1120
02:14:00.542 --> 02:14:05.697 line:82%
-Salutations Didi... Salutations Jeejaji
-Salutations to you too... Who is this?

1121
02:14:06.875 --> 02:14:08.375 line:82%
You are not able to recognise her
because...

1122
02:14:08.458 --> 02:14:10.757 line:82%
You are seeing her fully clothed for
the first time. It's your sister-in-law.

1123
02:14:10.958 --> 02:14:12.208 line:82%
You mean our Poo?

1124
02:14:15.458 --> 02:14:18.317 line:82%
Have a laddoo!
Mother has sent them.

1125
02:14:18.917 --> 02:14:20.917 line:82%
I thought I should
keep them as of ferings.

1126
02:14:21.542 --> 02:14:23.167 line:82%
Let me do the tika for you.

1127
02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:28.875 line:82%
Won't you get your tika done?

1128
02:14:30.917 --> 02:14:33.458 line:82%
Back home no one leaves
the house without a tika.

1129
02:14:34.583 --> 02:14:36.458 line:82%
Mother says it's an auspicious
start for the day.

1130
02:14:38.625 --> 02:14:44.117 line:82%
Mother says?
So then... do it.

1131
02:15:18.333 --> 02:15:20.197 line:82%
-Now who has done this?
-Me of course.

1132
02:15:20.417 --> 02:15:22.292 line:82%
I enjoy puncturing tyres.

1133
02:15:23.917 --> 02:15:25.917 line:82%
-Was that a joke?
-It was... so?

1134
02:15:32.333 --> 02:15:33.583 line:82%
No I don't want...

1135
02:15:33.875 --> 02:15:37.000 line:82%
A guest is equal to a God. And you
can't refuse a lift of fered by God.

1136
02:15:37.292 --> 02:15:39.042 line:82%
-Come on go now.
-I'll take a taxi.

1137
02:15:39.292 --> 02:15:41.000 line:82%
Give me the money you would have
paid the cab.

1138
02:15:43.292 --> 02:15:44.833 line:82%
That I am.

1139
02:15:45.292 --> 02:15:47.042 line:82%
Listen... Please come back home
early in the evening.

1140
02:15:47.375 --> 02:15:49.000 line:82%
-Why?
-Just!

1141
02:15:50.792 --> 02:15:52.250 line:82%
I have finished...
now let's leave.

1142
02:16:12.333 --> 02:16:14.292 line:82%
By the way are you
interested in cricket?

1143
02:16:14.958 --> 02:16:15.958 line:82%
Why?

1144
02:16:16.125 --> 02:16:18.817 line:82%
Because there's a match.
India v/s England... at the oval.

1145
02:16:21.792 --> 02:16:23.750 line:82%
It must be the last over.

1146
02:16:24.208 --> 02:16:26.208 line:82%
Is it a stolen car?
-No.

1147
02:16:26.833 --> 02:16:28.292 line:82%
-Is it yours?
-Yes.

1148
02:16:28.458 --> 02:16:30.125 line:82%
Then do what pleases you.

1149
02:16:49.958 --> 02:16:52.537 line:82%
Don't say anything now. Anything
can happen at the last minute.

1150
02:16:52.708 --> 02:16:54.125 line:82%
You can never bank on India.

1151
02:17:01.833 --> 02:17:07.000 line:82%
Did you call me 'Brother'?
-Why? Should I?

1152
02:17:07.458 --> 02:17:10.250 line:82%
Why? Just drive the car carefully.

1153
02:17:14.667 --> 02:17:17.542 line:82%
Hey! We won...
-We will win!

1154
02:17:29.542 --> 02:17:31.500 line:82%
Like every year
Poo will decide on the boy...

1155
02:17:31.667 --> 02:17:34.817 line:82%
who will escort her to the prom.

1156
02:17:41.083 --> 02:17:44.750 line:82%
You will be given marks on ten.
To go to the prom with me...

1157
02:17:44.917 --> 02:17:47.875 line:82%
you have to be brilliant in
three departments.

1158
02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:39.000 line:82%
You are not so bad.

1159
02:18:39.375 --> 02:18:42.837 line:82%
I wasn't talking about myself.
I was giving you points.

1160
02:18:52.542 --> 02:18:54.500 line:82%
I will go only with
him to the prom.

1161
02:18:56.833 --> 02:18:58.458 line:82%
Where will he go?

1162
02:19:26.667 --> 02:19:27.875 line:82%
Just fell.

1163
02:19:37.917 --> 02:19:41.797 line:82%
I'm leaving... I'm leaving.

1164
02:19:44.542 --> 02:19:48.708 line:82%
Listen...
I want to say something to you.

1165
02:19:50.625 --> 02:19:52.583 line:82%
Say it fast.
I don't have time.

1166
02:19:53.250 --> 02:19:55.250 line:82%
-Should I say it?
-Say it.

1167
02:19:59.042 --> 02:20:01.000 line:82%
-Should I?
-Please say.

1168
02:20:01.792 --> 02:20:03.750 line:82%
-You have...
-Yes?

1169
02:20:04.292 --> 02:20:06.750 line:82%
-You have...
-Say it please.

1170
02:20:08.292 --> 02:20:10.250 line:82%
-Both...
-Both of us.

1171
02:20:10.833 --> 02:20:12.583 line:82%
-Both...
-Both...

1172
02:20:13.375 --> 02:20:16.250 line:82%
Both... Both of your
shoes are not matched.

1173
02:20:23.250 --> 02:20:25.958 line:82%
That's the latest fashion.
I don't think you know.

1174
02:20:47.417 --> 02:20:49.375 line:82%
Please tell Didi
not to wait for me.

1175
02:21:11.333 --> 02:21:12.500 line:82%
Where are you?

1176
02:21:29.958 --> 02:21:32.557 line:82%
From the moment

1177
02:21:34.117 --> 02:21:37.237 line:82%
I set my eyes on you...

1178
02:21:39.375 --> 02:21:42.750 line:82%
I marked you to be mine

1179
02:21:48.792 --> 02:21:51.937 line:82%
Don't turn your back on me,

1180
02:21:53.625 --> 02:21:56.477 line:82%
you are mine, only mine

1181
02:22:41.375 --> 02:22:45.458 line:82%
From the moment I set
my eyes on you...

1182
02:22:45.958 --> 02:22:49.667 line:82%
I marked you to be mine

1183
02:22:50.458 --> 02:22:54.417 line:82%
Don't turn your back on me,
you are mine, only mine

1184
02:22:54.958 --> 02:22:59.417 line:82%
Please say it, you are my soniya

1185
02:23:22.208 --> 02:23:26.083 line:82%
From the moment I set
my eyes on you...

1186
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:30.857 line:82%
I marked you to be mine

1187
02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:35.667 line:82%
Don't turn your back on me,
you are mine, only mine

1188
02:23:35.917 --> 02:23:40.357 line:82%
I accede, you are my soniya

1189
02:24:28.125 --> 02:24:33.997 line:82%
I'm wounded by your love,
that's what makes me act the way I do

1190
02:24:37.333 --> 02:24:43.057 line:82%
That's a nice line to fool me
But it won't work on me

1191
02:24:46.417 --> 02:24:50.417 line:82%
It has taken years for us
to meet each other

1192
02:24:50.708 --> 02:24:54.708 line:82%
Hope these moments last forever

1193
02:24:55.333 --> 02:24:59.457 line:82%
this moment of bliss intoxicates me

1194
02:24:59.625 --> 02:25:03.708 line:82%
Please say it once, you are my soniya

1195
02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:12.958 line:82%
I accede, you are my soniya

1196
02:25:49.625 --> 02:25:54.657 line:82%
Your presence drives me crazy,
I can't think straight"

1197
02:25:58.833 --> 02:26:04.797 line:82%
I place you on my eyelashes,
so you are in my dreams forever

1198
02:26:07.417 --> 02:26:11.667 line:82%
I want to hold you tight

1199
02:26:12.625 --> 02:26:16.667 line:82%
I am yours forever, I vow today

1200
02:26:16.958 --> 02:26:20.875 line:82%
Let's both vow at this moment,
that we'll never love each other less

1201
02:26:23.458 --> 02:26:27.458 line:82%
Please say it, you are my soniya

1202
02:27:04.208 --> 02:27:08.437 line:82%
You, you, you are my sonia,
Hey you are, you are my soniya

1203
02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:15.837 line:82%
One minute, child...
one minute... What happened?

1204
02:27:22.292 --> 02:27:24.542 line:82%
Mr. Vajpayee had called for you...
he wants you back in India.

1205
02:27:33.917 --> 02:27:35.875 line:82%
-It's his...
-What's the date today, dad?

1206
02:27:36.125 --> 02:27:37.333 line:82%
6th Sepetember.

1207
02:27:39.042 --> 02:27:41.977 line:82%
Pooja, Couldn't you wear
decent clothes at least today?

1208
02:27:42.083 --> 02:27:43.542 line:82%
You came in these strange
black clothes.

1209
02:27:43.625 --> 02:27:45.208 line:82%
Do you know everyone was
staring at us in the temple?

1210
02:27:45.542 --> 02:27:49.208 line:82%
If everyone was staring at me instead
of God then it's not my problem.

1211
02:27:55.017 --> 02:27:58.000 line:82%
Did you hear that, Rahul? She speaks
nonsense even on Bauji's birthday?

1212
02:27:58.125 --> 02:27:59.750 line:82%
Today is father's birthday.

1213
02:28:03.167 --> 02:28:05.125 line:82%
Today is bauji's birthday?

1214
02:28:15.977 --> 02:28:18.517 line:82%
Look at her... From Poo to Parvati...
What happened to you?

1215
02:28:24.542 --> 02:28:26.500 line:82%
Please take it...
it's the of fering from the prayer

1216
02:28:30.375 --> 02:28:32.250 line:82%
But aren't of ferings on
birthday done for the?

1217
02:28:32.833 --> 02:28:35.250 line:82%
I know. But Bauji
was a very funloving man...

1218
02:28:35.625 --> 02:28:39.017 line:82%
he said even after I go
always remember me on a happy day.

1219
02:28:39.708 --> 02:28:42.375 line:82%
That's why every year on his birthday
Pooja and I've a special prayer for him

1220
02:28:42.833 --> 02:28:45.583 line:82%
lf he had to see Pooja like this today,
he would've been unconscious.

1221
02:28:48.667 --> 02:28:52.042 line:82%
You must feel sad that he
is no longer with you now.

1222
02:28:53.250 --> 02:28:55.097 line:82%
Yes... we do.

1223
02:28:55.958 --> 02:28:58.250 line:82%
It's important to have the warmth of
elders in a house...

1224
02:28:59.667 --> 02:29:03.500 line:82%
or else a family always feels
incomplete... Isn't it?

1225
02:29:12.833 --> 02:29:14.458 line:82%
Don't you miss him?

1226
02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:20.292 line:82%
Don't you miss?

1227
02:29:23.542 --> 02:29:25.208 line:82%
Don't you miss Bauji?

1228
02:29:28.757 --> 02:29:31.708 line:82%
You guys haven't had
your breakfast... Pooja, Krishi...

1229
02:29:32.583 --> 02:29:33.837 line:82%
Come on... Please come.

1230
02:29:36.875 --> 02:29:38.458 line:82%
Even you are coming aren't you?

1231
02:30:25.167 --> 02:30:26.625 line:82%
I forgot.

1232
02:30:29.667 --> 02:30:33.177 line:82%
The one who is not here
is etched in my memory and the one...

1233
02:30:34.667 --> 02:30:38.042 line:82%
who is right here,
I forgot about him.

1234
02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:42.250 line:82%
What present should I give you?

1235
02:30:44.208 --> 02:30:46.167 line:82%
Just return my Nandini back to me.

1236
02:30:50.083 --> 02:30:55.125 line:82%
We have lost each other
in this big house.

1237
02:30:58.750 --> 02:31:02.708 line:82%
Just get back my Nandini for me.

1238
02:31:06.597 --> 02:31:08.250 line:82%
I want nothing else.

1239
02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:13.667 line:82%
Nothing else.

1240
02:31:19.625 --> 02:31:20.625 line:82%
Listen...

1241
02:31:51.792 --> 02:31:54.583 line:82%
What's the matter?
Your affection is quite overwhelming.

1242
02:31:55.542 --> 02:31:59.217 line:82%
Yes... That's because you are
looking extremely...

1243
02:31:59.625 --> 02:32:02.457 line:82%
what do they call it? 'Sexy'.

1244
02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.333 line:82%
Krishi will see.

1245
02:32:09.917 --> 02:32:12.875 line:82%
By the way, that should have been
my line... Go now.

1246
02:32:13.042 --> 02:32:16.237 line:82%
-My bag and my coat.
-I'll just get it.

1247
02:32:21.417 --> 02:32:23.458 line:82%
Listen, day after tomorrow
it's Karwa Chauth...

1248
02:32:23.542 --> 02:32:24.958 line:82%
Wow! So what am I supposed to do?

1249
02:32:25.250 --> 02:32:29.617 line:82%
You don't do anything. Like every year
there's party for Indians

1250
02:32:33.458 --> 02:32:35.000 line:82%
You are leaving?

1251
02:32:41.542 --> 02:32:42.667 line:82%
What is it?

1252
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:52.083 line:82%
He keeps popping up everywhere.

1253
02:33:04.437 --> 02:33:07.500 line:82%
-So Karwa Chauth!
-Yes... it's day after tomorrow.

1254
02:33:08.292 --> 02:33:10.977 line:82%
-So you must have received the Sargi.
-Sargi?

1255
02:33:15.217 --> 02:33:19.125 line:82%
Sargi... Don't you know what sargi is?
It's a ritual for karwa chauth...

1256
02:33:19.208 --> 02:33:21.477 line:82%
it's something that every mother-in-law
sends for her daughter-in-law.

1257
02:33:22.833 --> 02:33:24.557 line:82%
Hasn't your mother-in-law
sent it for you?

1258
02:33:32.375 --> 02:33:35.250 line:82%
Some elder person of your family
must be sending it to you.

1259
02:33:36.542 --> 02:33:38.042 line:82%
No...

1260
02:33:43.208 --> 02:33:47.000 line:82%
Don't worry. This year
you will get your sargi.

1261
02:33:52.917 --> 02:33:55.708 line:82%
My mother... she will
explain everything to you.

1262
02:34:03.833 --> 02:34:06.457 line:82%
-Greetings to you, my child!
-Greetings.

1263
02:34:07.208 --> 02:34:09.958 line:82%
My son speaks so much about
your family that I feel almost like

1264
02:34:10.917 --> 02:34:12.875 line:82%
I'm there with all of you.

1265
02:34:14.250 --> 02:34:16.458 line:82%
He has become a part of
our small family.

1266
02:34:17.875 --> 02:34:19.708 line:82%
I hope he is not
troubling you too much.

1267
02:34:22.917 --> 02:34:24.875 line:82%
Dear child, Sargi is something that...

1268
02:34:24.958 --> 02:34:27.125 line:82%
every mother-in-law sends
for her daughter-in-law.

1269
02:34:29.583 --> 02:34:33.542 line:82%
Some sweets, a few almonds and...

1270
02:34:35.875 --> 02:34:38.073 line:82%
signs of marital bliss...

1271
02:34:38.157 --> 02:34:43.777 line:82%
and lots of love.

1272
02:34:52.958 --> 02:34:54.717 line:82%
I'll send it to you.

1273
02:34:56.167 --> 02:34:58.397 line:82%
I will think I have sent.
It to my daughter-in-law.

1274
02:35:12.292 --> 02:35:16.537 line:82%
-OK my child I'll hang up now!
-OK.

1275
02:35:48.792 --> 02:35:54.317 line:82%
At times why do even strangers
seem like they are your own?

1276
02:36:12.417 --> 02:36:15.375 line:82%
And why is it, at times...

1277
02:36:16.417 --> 02:36:18.375 line:82%
that even our own people
become strangers?

1278
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.083 line:82%
Listen... Even I have kept
the karwa chauth fast today.

1279
02:36:33.625 --> 02:36:35.437 line:82%
For whom?

1280
02:36:37.417 --> 02:36:39.833 line:82%
-What's going on there?
-Something that doesn't happen here.

1281
02:36:41.792 --> 02:36:44.477 line:82%
Karwa chauth fast?
That too for me?

1282
02:36:45.208 --> 02:36:48.697 line:82%
Why? Who am I of yours?

1283
02:36:54.417 --> 02:36:56.417 line:82%
You don't have the guts
to tell your brother and bhabhi...

1284
02:36:56.750 --> 02:36:59.792 line:82%
how you are related to them...
Trying to be a great tiger before me!

1285
02:37:01.042 --> 02:37:02.417 line:82%
Let go of my hand.

1286
02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:04.517 line:82%
Why has he held her hand?
-Let go of my hand.

1287
02:37:04.583 --> 02:37:05.477 line:82%
I let go.

1288
02:37:07.375 --> 02:37:11.333 line:82%
What if l tell them?
Today in the presence of everyone...

1289
02:37:12.625 --> 02:37:17.708 line:82%
what if l tell them the truth,
what will you do?

1290
02:37:18.208 --> 02:37:21.042 line:82%
I don't think you will be able to.
You are scared.

1291
02:37:23.042 --> 02:37:24.792 line:82%
What if l do?

1292
02:37:25.458 --> 02:37:27.958 line:82%
Then I will tell
everyone what's in my heart.

1293
02:37:28.833 --> 02:37:32.875 line:82%
-Really? Is that so?
-It's a bet.

1294
02:37:34.083 --> 02:37:36.333 line:82%
Don't bet with me,
you might regret.

1295
02:37:38.292 --> 02:37:41.500 line:82%
Maybe that's what I want.

1296
02:37:43.667 --> 02:37:45.500 line:82%
But looking at you...

1297
02:37:46.208 --> 02:37:49.237 line:82%
I wonder if all this is a dream.

1298
02:37:50.167 --> 02:37:51.125 line:82%
Dream?

1299
02:37:53.458 --> 02:37:55.875 line:82%
Yes... How can anyone
be so frightened?

1300
02:39:23.625 --> 02:39:24.750 line:82%
Your turn.

1301
02:39:31.042 --> 02:39:36.000 line:82%
My trinkets tinkle...

1302
02:39:37.517 --> 02:39:42.597 line:82%
they say I am yours

1303
02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:53.477 line:82%
I can't spend a minute without you,
Oh I am yours

1304
02:39:58.458 --> 02:40:01.792 line:82%
Take me away...
oh darling take me away

1305
02:40:16.833 --> 02:40:22.357 line:82%
My trinkets tinkle...
they say I am yours,

1306
02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:40.833 line:82%
I can't spend a minute without you,
Oh I am yours

1307
02:40:40.917 --> 02:40:44.417 line:82%
Take me away,
oh darling take me away.

1308
02:40:50.292 --> 02:40:55.677 line:82%
Your trinkets tinkle...
they say I am yours...

1309
02:41:00.292 --> 02:41:04.625 line:82%
can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours

1310
02:41:04.708 --> 02:41:09.357 line:82%
Take me away, oh darling,
take me away

1311
02:41:47.417 --> 02:41:51.717 line:82%
I can't think of a life
without you,

1312
02:41:51.875 --> 02:41:55.833 line:82%
I spend sleepless nights
counting stars in the sky,

1313
02:41:57.167 --> 02:42:01.458 line:82%
my heart keeps calling out to you,
my bindiya makes a sign,

1314
02:42:02.292 --> 02:42:07.837 line:82%
The shimmering bindiya,
shines like a star next to the moon,

1315
02:42:16.833 --> 02:42:21.708 line:82%
My anklets call out to you,
try to make up to you as you sulk,

1316
02:42:21.792 --> 02:42:26.708 line:82%
Oh my loved, my beloved.
Try and understand...

1317
02:42:26.792 --> 02:42:29.083 line:82%
what I'm trying to say

1318
02:42:29.667 --> 02:42:35.417 line:82%
Your trinkets tinkle,
they say I am yours

1319
02:42:39.417 --> 02:42:43.583 line:82%
Can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours.

1320
02:42:43.667 --> 02:42:47.000 line:82%
Take me away, oh darling,
take me away.

1321
02:43:18.958 --> 02:43:21.375 line:82%
May we be in
marital bliss forever...

1322
02:43:23.667 --> 02:43:26.167 line:82%
may our soulmates be
with us forever

1323
02:43:28.875 --> 02:43:33.333 line:82%
Now that you have entered my world,
never leave

1324
02:43:33.708 --> 02:43:38.250 line:82%
Take my hand and ask me
to be yours forever

1325
02:43:43.875 --> 02:43:49.577 line:82%
Oh darling you look so beautiful,
seems like you have been made for me

1326
02:43:53.167 --> 02:43:58.757 line:82%
Your beauty shines so brightly,
that it shames the moon

1327
02:44:01.208 --> 02:44:05.792 line:82%
Go away you liar, I'm not taken in

1328
02:44:05.875 --> 02:44:10.167 line:82%
Don't flatter too much,
your giving yourself away

1329
02:44:20.667 --> 02:44:25.083 line:82%
I wish from the bottom of my heart,
may your pair be forever

1330
02:44:25.250 --> 02:44:30.997 line:82%
Oh my love, my beloved, wish
we spent our lives together forever

1331
02:44:38.167 --> 02:44:43.377 line:82%
Your trinkets tinkle,
they say I am yours

1332
02:44:48.708 --> 02:44:53.250 line:82%
Can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours

1333
02:44:53.375 --> 02:44:56.708 line:82%
Take me away, oh darling,
take me away

1334
02:46:54.292 --> 02:46:55.750 line:82%
You are mad!

1335
02:46:56.667 --> 02:46:58.083 line:82%
My son has turned into
a complete Englishman.

1336
02:46:58.167 --> 02:46:59.557 line:82%
No. Not at all.

1337
02:47:00.208 --> 02:47:03.357 line:82%
Really, Aunty... Sometimes
I wish we were living in India.

1338
02:47:04.375 --> 02:47:07.625 line:82%
And Krishi would sing the
same songs that I grew up singing.

1339
02:47:09.625 --> 02:47:14.657 line:82%
But we are here and I have become
'mummy' from a mother.

1340
02:47:14.875 --> 02:47:17.000 line:82%
Why do you think so, Anjali?
Whatever the tongue...

1341
02:47:17.250 --> 02:47:18.708 line:82%
the culture is yours, isn't it?

1342
02:47:18.792 --> 02:47:24.597 line:82%
Still... It's not the same, Aunty...
...Just see... Coming!

1343
02:47:28.792 --> 02:47:29.750 line:82%
Mad!

1344
02:47:30.708 --> 02:47:34.997 line:82%
By the way, D... j... Daijaan,
What are these children doing?

1345
02:47:36.958 --> 02:47:40.667 line:82%
There's a function in Baba's school.
They are rehearsing for that.

1346
02:47:40.750 --> 02:47:43.625 line:82%
All of us are going for it.
You will come with us, won't you?

1347
02:47:49.667 --> 02:47:51.157 line:82%
I'll just be back.

1348
02:48:01.125 --> 02:48:02.708 line:82%
What do I do with this?

1349
02:48:15.083 --> 02:48:17.083 line:82%
What are you doing?
I'll manage myself.

1350
02:48:17.333 --> 02:48:19.250 line:82%
Leave it Daijaan,
I'll manage myself.

1351
02:48:19.958 --> 02:48:24.017 line:82%
I'll do it myself... Daijaan...
Daijaan... DJ!

1352
02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:35.757 line:82%
My little child! My child!

1353
02:48:38.708 --> 02:48:43.250 line:82%
I knew it...
My heart kept telling me

1354
02:48:44.542 --> 02:48:49.117 line:82%
that it was my Baba. Oh Allah!
How big you've grown up to be.

1355
02:48:55.250 --> 02:48:58.875 line:82%
You hid it from your DJ too?
You didn't even tell me?

1356
02:48:59.667 --> 02:49:02.717 line:82%
Why? My child, why?

1357
02:49:02.792 --> 02:49:05.790 line:82%
Didn't I keep telling you, Anjali?

1358
02:49:05.874 --> 02:49:09.750 line:82%
See, it's my little child!

1359
02:49:09.875 --> 02:49:12.613 line:82%
It's my child.

1360
02:49:12.697 --> 02:49:16.657 line:82%
You have come back to me.

1361
02:49:25.958 --> 02:49:27.292 line:82%
My child!

1362
02:49:43.292 --> 02:49:44.625 line:82%
Just coming!

1363
02:49:56.917 --> 02:49:58.817 line:82%
Just coming!

1364
02:50:21.708 --> 02:50:23.277 line:82%
Oh! Where is Didi?
Where's she gone?

1365
02:50:33.125 --> 02:50:34.917 line:82%
Oh my God! Is this our table?

1366
02:50:35.083 --> 02:50:37.097 line:82%
They do this all the time.
Look at this, Aunty,

1367
02:50:37.208 --> 02:50:39.667 line:82%
They give the front seats to the
shining white army and seat us behind.

1368
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:42.177 line:82%
Why do they do it
always? No... Aunty,

1369
02:50:42.333 --> 02:50:44.217 line:82%
Where is that silly principle?

1370
02:50:49.917 --> 02:50:51.583 line:82%
She has arrived, the cunning vixen.

1371
02:50:57.125 --> 02:50:59.750 line:82%
Is she the Queen of England that
she's got the table in the front?

1372
02:51:05.458 --> 02:51:08.417 line:82%
Please go you silly woman...
Hope your table starts shaking...

1373
02:51:08.500 --> 02:51:10.257 line:82%
hope your chair breaks to pieces.

1374
02:51:14.583 --> 02:51:16.497 line:82%
Should we sit?

1375
02:51:22.542 --> 02:51:24.625 line:82%
Already there have been a
lot of complaints.

1376
02:51:24.750 --> 02:51:27.000 line:82%
Even last year at this function
you had created a ruckus!

1377
02:51:27.708 --> 02:51:30.375 line:82%
Krishi is performing... Very nice...
what's the big deal?

1378
02:51:30.792 --> 02:51:33.097 line:82%
You just shut up and stop
this Englishwoman act of yours!

1379
02:51:33.208 --> 02:51:34.750 line:82%
Anjali, she's right!
-You keep quiet.

1380
02:51:34.917 --> 02:51:38.077 line:82%
My son's on stage...
I will at least whistle once.

1381
02:51:38.208 --> 02:51:41.517 line:82%
-No... No...
-Just one whistle...

1382
02:52:02.750 --> 02:52:07.677 line:82%
How sweet my son looks!
He looks just like you, sweetoo!

1383
02:52:12.708 --> 02:52:14.208 line:82%
God, Please protect my son.

1384
02:52:14.292 --> 02:52:16.625 line:82%
Eh! Your son is just performing...
not fighting a war on the border.

1385
02:52:16.958 --> 02:52:18.958 line:82%
-Just see!
-Just see!

1386
02:52:24.708 --> 02:52:27.137 line:82%
-My son! My son!
-Even mine.

1387
02:52:29.917 --> 02:52:31.208 line:82%
Now sing your, 'Do Re Mi'.

1388
02:54:59.375 --> 02:55:00.958 line:82%
Did you do this?

1389
02:55:24.083 --> 02:55:27.292 line:82%
Now tell me something...
You must have been a little nervous?

1390
02:55:27.458 --> 02:55:30.250 line:82%
I was a little nervous.
But someone said something to me...

1391
02:55:30.375 --> 02:55:32.042 line:82%
and everything was alright.

1392
02:55:33.542 --> 02:55:35.876 line:82%
-What did the person say?
-Just a minute.

1393
02:55:37.708 --> 02:55:41.458 line:82%
If you want to be someone in life...
if you want to achieve something...

1394
02:55:41.583 --> 02:55:44.596 line:82%
lf you want to win, always
listen to your hear.

1395
02:55:44.875 --> 02:55:47.576 line:82%
And if even that doesn't
give you any answers...

1396
02:55:47.667 --> 02:55:51.000 line:82%
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

1397
02:55:51.125 --> 02:55:54.042 line:82%
And then you will
cross all the hurdles...

1398
02:55:54.583 --> 02:55:57.542 line:82%
all your problems will vanish,
victory will be yours...

1399
02:55:58.500 --> 02:55:59.833 line:82%
only yours.

1400
02:56:02.167 --> 02:56:08.136 line:82%
-Who said this? Papa?
-No. He.

1401
02:56:38.542 --> 02:56:40.216 line:82%
Did you take care of mother?

1402
02:56:47.833 --> 02:56:49.792 line:82%
Did you get selected
in the cricket team?

1403
02:57:01.083 --> 02:57:03.750 line:82%
How did you manage
to lose so much weight?

1404
02:57:12.667 --> 02:57:15.876 line:82%
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

1405
02:57:16.042 --> 02:57:20.516 line:82%
Come back home, Brother.
Please come back home.

1406
02:57:21.208 --> 02:57:23.167 line:82%
Come back home, Brother.

1407
02:57:25.167 --> 02:57:27.000 line:82%
Has Papa sent you?

1408
02:57:36.417 --> 02:57:39.000 line:82%
Rohan, now this is my family.

1409
02:57:40.833 --> 02:57:44.316 line:82%
These are my people.
This is my world!

1410
02:57:48.833 --> 02:57:53.917 line:82%
And the home you are talking about
was never mine in the first place...

1411
02:57:57.625 --> 02:57:59.583 line:82%
and will never be.

1412
02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:06.375 line:82%
You go back now... just go back.
You...

1413
02:58:08.583 --> 02:58:12.542 line:82%
I have seen you again,
that's enough for me.

1414
02:58:13.708 --> 02:58:15.292 line:82%
Go back.

1415
02:58:23.042 --> 02:58:28.375 line:82%
Do you know Brother,
you of ten said when I was a child

1416
02:58:30.833 --> 02:58:32.792 line:82%
That mother loved you more than me.

1417
02:58:36.792 --> 02:58:38.375 line:82%
I never liked it then.

1418
02:58:40.750 --> 02:58:42.333 line:82%
I used to get angry.

1419
02:58:46.042 --> 02:58:48.375 line:82%
But today, I would like to tell you,
that you were right.

1420
02:58:51.542 --> 02:58:53.500 line:82%
Mother loves you more than me.

1421
02:58:56.292 --> 02:59:01.596 line:82%
She loves you too much.
And she will always.

1422
02:59:04.417 --> 02:59:07.375 line:82%
-She will always
-I know.

1423
02:59:13.500 --> 02:59:15.556 line:82%
He hasn't forgotten Dad's words.

1424
02:59:21.125 --> 02:59:22.736 line:82%
He will never come back.

1425
02:59:28.458 --> 02:59:32.417 line:82%
He will come Rohan.
He will definitely come back.

1426
02:59:33.833 --> 02:59:35.792 line:82%
I know my brother-in-law well.

1427
02:59:37.333 --> 02:59:39.667 line:82%
Just get him to meet
mother and father.

1428
02:59:45.250 --> 02:59:47.136 line:82%
Will you be able to do that?

1429
03:00:00.792 --> 03:00:02.576 line:82%
You know, dad...
I had a strange dream last night.

1430
03:00:02.667 --> 03:00:06.625 line:82%
I dreamt that you and Mom had come
to London to surprise me.

1431
03:00:06.875 --> 03:00:09.416 line:82%
-Then?
-What then, dad?

1432
03:00:09.596 --> 03:00:11.516 line:82%
The alarm went of f... I mean...

1433
03:00:11.583 --> 03:00:13.756 line:82%
why would you and Mom come to
London to surprise me?

1434
03:00:19.667 --> 03:00:21.000 line:82%
I'll speak to you later

1435
03:00:31.125 --> 03:00:31.958 line:82%
The work's done.

1436
03:00:47.333 --> 03:00:49.296 line:82%
-Guess where we are.
-Where, dad?

1437
03:00:53.250 --> 03:00:56.292 line:82%
Is it ever possible that my son dreams
of something and I don't turn it true.

1438
03:00:57.375 --> 03:01:00.417 line:82%
Tell me where you are right now,
we want to meet you just now...

1439
03:01:00.556 --> 03:01:02.916 line:82%
You are meeting me
after such a long time.

1440
03:01:04.736 --> 03:01:08.216 line:82%
Present? Now...
at this time... here...

1441
03:01:08.333 --> 03:01:10.292 line:82%
You meet me at 5 p.m. At
the Blue water Shopping mall.

1442
03:01:10.958 --> 03:01:12.958 line:82%
But tell me what
you want, my child.

1443
03:01:13.292 --> 03:01:16.250 line:82%
You will find what
I want right there, Dad.

1444
03:01:33.756 --> 03:01:35.156 line:82%
-What's happening here?
-I'm looking for the receipts.

1445
03:01:35.250 --> 03:01:38.116 line:82%
-What receipts?
-To return the clothes.

1446
03:01:38.250 --> 03:01:40.292 line:82%
If you have to return them, why do you
buy them in the first place?

1447
03:01:40.375 --> 03:01:43.083 line:82%
The country best in the world
is our India... Right Mom?

1448
03:01:43.208 --> 03:01:44.583 line:82%
Mother's stooge!

1449
03:01:47.667 --> 03:01:51.916 line:82%
Did you tape that? That Indian serial,
Kyon Ki Saas Bhi kabhi bahu thi.

1450
03:01:52.036 --> 03:01:54.156 line:82%
What a brilliant twist!
The son dies.

1451
03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:57.596 line:82%
Oh God! Really? Oh No...
You have given away the suspense.

1452
03:02:00.458 --> 03:02:02.417 line:82%
-What are you doing?
-It's fine till the hugs

1453
03:02:02.500 --> 03:02:05.056 line:82%
-but he keeps kissing me too.
-You have never kissed me so much.

1454
03:02:05.176 --> 03:02:07.716 line:82%
Come home, darling... and see.

1455
03:02:12.996 --> 03:02:14.956 line:82%
Next time if he will kiss me again,
I will not leave him.

1456
03:02:15.125 --> 03:02:17.333 line:82%
Did i ask him to kiss you?

1457
03:06:39.500 --> 03:06:43.167 line:82%
Lies! You lied to me.

1458
03:06:44.458 --> 03:06:46.958 line:82%
Yes... I lied to you, Dad.

1459
03:06:48.417 --> 03:06:50.375 line:82%
What would I have achieved even if
I had told truth.

1460
03:06:51.542 --> 03:06:53.516 line:82%
I wouldn't be able to break
your ego.

1461
03:06:54.500 --> 03:06:56.076 line:82%
What else is it if not ego, Dad?

1462
03:06:56.542 --> 03:06:58.956 line:82%
That separates a mother from her child
that takes away...

1463
03:06:59.542 --> 03:07:02.208 line:82%
a brother from his sibling... that
throws a father away from his son?

1464
03:07:02.625 --> 03:07:04.736 line:82%
He is not my son!

1465
03:07:06.125 --> 03:07:07.625 line:82%
I don't believe that he is my son.

1466
03:07:08.125 --> 03:07:10.167 line:82%
Has he fulfilled the duties
of a son? He didn't.

1467
03:07:11.583 --> 03:07:14.667 line:82%
He did, Dad... he did.

1468
03:07:17.667 --> 03:07:19.458 line:82%
He always fulfilled them.

1469
03:07:21.167 --> 03:07:25.856 line:82%
He only made one mistake... Love.

1470
03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.583 line:82%
If that is a crime according to
your law, so be it.

1471
03:07:32.292 --> 03:07:35.276 line:82%
But isn't it your duty as an elder
to forgive him for his mistake?

1472
03:07:38.667 --> 03:07:40.667 line:82%
But you came down to punishing him.

1473
03:07:44.917 --> 03:07:46.875 line:82%
What kind of punishment is this, Dad?

1474
03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:52.417 line:82%
What punishment is this?

1475
03:08:00.333 --> 03:08:01.917 line:82%
Just look into my eyes and say that...

1476
03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:03.958 line:82%
you don't feel the pain
of parting with him.

1477
03:08:05.625 --> 03:08:07.458 line:82%
Say that you don't remember him.

1478
03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:10.667 line:82%
Say that you don't love him.

1479
03:08:13.292 --> 03:08:16.196 line:82%
Say it, Dad. Say it.

1480
03:08:16.917 --> 03:08:21.542 line:82%
I don't love him.
I don't love him.

1481
03:08:22.417 --> 03:08:24.083 line:82%
I said it, didn't I?

1482
03:08:37.996 --> 03:08:43.236 line:82%
God has blessed you
with everything, Dad... Everything.

1483
03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:48.292 line:82%
I just wish he had given you a heart!
-Shut up!

1484
03:08:49.583 --> 03:08:50.917 line:82%
You irreverent child!

1485
03:08:58.417 --> 03:08:59.976 line:82%
You love him.

1486
03:09:04.250 --> 03:09:07.750 line:82%
You love him a lot.
You love him a lot.

1487
03:09:10.667 --> 03:09:16.625 line:82%
I have got my answer.
You really love him.

1488
03:09:20.167 --> 03:09:21.616 line:82%
Let's go back, Rahul.

1489
03:09:22.583 --> 03:09:27.176 line:82%
It's too much now...
This is not our country.

1490
03:09:27.542 --> 03:09:31.636 line:82%
These are not our people.
We have set up a house here...

1491
03:09:32.833 --> 03:09:35.792 line:82%
but have you ever wondered
what kind of a home is this...

1492
03:09:37.417 --> 03:09:40.836 line:82%
that doesn't have a mother's
warmth or a father's blessings?

1493
03:09:43.875 --> 03:09:47.542 line:82%
Let's go back, Rahul.
Mother and Father are here...

1494
03:09:48.708 --> 03:09:54.336 line:82%
They are right here.
They are elders.

1495
03:09:57.083 --> 03:10:01.667 line:82%
They are a little angry with us.
But we will ask for forgiveness.

1496
03:10:03.500 --> 03:10:07.458 line:82%
Rahul... I know
they are as incomplete without us...

1497
03:10:08.458 --> 03:10:10.417 line:82%
as we are without them.

1498
03:10:11.542 --> 03:10:15.336 line:82%
We will ask for forgiveness, Rahul.
Let's go back.

1499
03:10:20.458 --> 03:10:22.292 line:82%
You will never understand.

1500
03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:29.958 line:82%
To turn a stranger into your own...

1501
03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:32.958 line:82%
and then to turn him back
to a stranger...

1502
03:10:35.667 --> 03:10:37.625 line:82%
you can never understand the pain.

1503
03:10:40.125 --> 03:10:43.083 line:82%
I agree they are elders...

1504
03:10:46.250 --> 03:10:48.236 line:82%
but even they don't have the right
to break a heart.

1505
03:10:51.333 --> 03:10:53.625 line:82%
Even they don't have
a right to break a heart.

1506
03:11:16.917 --> 03:11:18.875 line:82%
I think we should call him back.

1507
03:12:01.833 --> 03:12:06.458 line:82%
Yash, It was her last wish
to have Rahul...

1508
03:12:07.625 --> 03:12:11.016 line:82%
Just wait for a while... I
know he will definitely come.

1509
03:12:12.917 --> 03:12:15.708 line:82%
We don't need to wait
for anyone... Rohan.

1510
03:13:18.917 --> 03:13:20.917 line:82%
Rahul and Anjali are leaving.

1511
03:13:24.375 --> 03:13:26.375 line:82%
They are leaving tomorrow from here.

1512
03:13:28.958 --> 03:13:30.917 line:82%
They haven't even come home.

1513
03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:38.583 line:82%
If you say to them...

1514
03:13:56.708 --> 03:14:01.917 line:82%
Do you know mother always
says that...

1515
03:14:03.583 --> 03:14:05.333 line:82%
a husband is God.

1516
03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:10.958 line:82%
No matter what he says...
no matter what he thinks...

1517
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:13.417 line:82%
he is always right.

1518
03:14:15.125 --> 03:14:19.436 line:82%
You brought Rahul home one day...
right.

1519
03:14:21.375 --> 03:14:25.056 line:82%
We gave him lots of love... right.

1520
03:14:27.456 --> 03:14:30.096 line:82%
He became a part of our family.

1521
03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:38.708 line:82%
He became my life...
right... absolutely right!

1522
03:14:42.167 --> 03:14:47.042 line:82%
Then... one day he left home
and went away.

1523
03:14:50.042 --> 03:14:51.000 line:82%
Wrong

1524
03:14:53.625 --> 03:14:57.583 line:82%
You let him leave... wrong

1525
03:15:00.625 --> 03:15:05.756 line:82%
You separated a mother from
her child... wrong.

1526
03:15:09.083 --> 03:15:15.042 line:82%
Our family shattered
to pieces... wrong.

1527
03:15:19.292 --> 03:15:21.542 line:82%
Then how does a husband become God?

1528
03:15:26.958 --> 03:15:29.125 line:82%
God can't do any wrong can he?

1529
03:15:34.750 --> 03:15:36.908 line:82%
My husband is just a husband...

1530
03:15:36.992 --> 03:15:42.356 line:82%
just a husband... Not God.

1531
03:15:47.292 --> 03:15:48.750 line:82%
Not God.

1532
03:15:51.875 --> 03:15:53.208 line:82%
Nandini!

1533
03:15:54.708 --> 03:16:00.292 line:82%
I said it... Didn't I?
That's it!

1534
03:16:40.708 --> 03:16:42.667 line:82%
Ever since the day you left,
Brother...

1535
03:16:43.917 --> 03:16:45.708 line:82%
mother has only seen you
through His eyes.

1536
03:16:48.456 --> 03:16:49.708 line:82%
He is the one who gave a mother...

1537
03:16:49.792 --> 03:16:51.476 line:82%
the strength to stay away
from her son.

1538
03:16:54.625 --> 03:16:56.583 line:82%
Please swear on Him, Brother...

1539
03:16:58.458 --> 03:17:00.417 line:82%
that you will come home
at least once.

1540
03:17:02.542 --> 03:17:03.917 line:82%
Just once, Brother.

1541
03:17:05.583 --> 03:17:10.333 line:82%
Even if it is for a moment.
Even if it is for a day.

1542
03:17:12.833 --> 03:17:14.625 line:82%
Let Bhabhi feel
at least once that

1543
03:17:14.792 --> 03:17:16.750 line:82%
she is the daughter-in-law
of this family.

1544
03:17:18.667 --> 03:17:20.316 line:82%
She is a part of the family.

1545
03:17:21.750 --> 03:17:23.833 line:82%
At least let your shadow fall
on the photograph...

1546
03:17:23.917 --> 03:17:26.542 line:82%
that has kept your memory alive in
mother's eyes for the last ten years.

1547
03:17:32.833 --> 03:17:37.792 line:82%
Just once, Brother.
Then you can leave

1548
03:17:39.292 --> 03:17:43.500 line:82%
No one will stop you.
No one will stop you.

1549
03:17:48.708 --> 03:17:50.667 line:82%
On the strength of that one memory...

1550
03:17:51.125 --> 03:17:55.833 line:82%
that one moment... Mother
can lead her entire life.

1551
03:17:59.833 --> 03:18:02.042 line:82%
Can't you do just this
much for mother?

1552
03:22:21.208 --> 03:22:23.458 line:82%
You took my words so much to heart
that you went away.

1553
03:22:25.625 --> 03:22:30.636 line:82%
Didn't even look back once.
Didn't come back even once.

1554
03:22:32.333 --> 03:22:33.833 line:82%
Didn't come back.

1555
03:22:35.625 --> 03:22:37.583 line:82%
Where did you call
me back, Papa?

1556
03:22:41.292 --> 03:22:43.125 line:82%
Did I have to call you back?

1557
03:22:44.292 --> 03:22:46.042 line:82%
Am I not elder?
Do I have to call you back?

1558
03:22:46.125 --> 03:22:47.500 line:82%
Am I not elder?

1559
03:22:49.917 --> 03:22:51.833 line:82%
I thought you didn't love me.

1560
03:22:52.833 --> 03:22:54.667 line:82%
I thought you didn't
think of me as your son.

1561
03:22:54.833 --> 03:22:58.936 line:82%
How could you think that?
How could you?

1562
03:23:00.458 --> 03:23:04.958 line:82%
I brought you into this house for
the first time with these hands.

1563
03:23:06.917 --> 03:23:09.875 line:82%
You completed our family.
You fulfilled all our dreams.

1564
03:23:11.542 --> 03:23:12.708 line:82%
How did you think?

1565
03:23:13.083 --> 03:23:17.296 line:82%
I thought you didn't love me...
didn't love me.

1566
03:23:18.833 --> 03:23:23.456 line:82%
I love you very much,
my son... love you very much.

1567
03:23:25.917 --> 03:23:31.750 line:82%
Just... just couldn't say it.

1568
03:23:33.958 --> 03:23:38.708 line:82%
In these ten years I have thought
about you every moment every day.

1569
03:23:40.042 --> 03:23:44.000 line:82%
I thought of you so much that,
I felt like embracing you and...

1570
03:23:44.083 --> 03:23:46.042 line:82%
telling you how much I love you.

1571
03:23:51.708 --> 03:23:53.500 line:82%
Just couldn't say it.

1572
03:23:57.750 --> 03:24:01.708 line:82%
Elders' anger is a part of ...
their love, my son.

1573
03:24:03.500 --> 03:24:07.292 line:82%
You took it so much to heart that
you got angry and left home?

1574
03:24:09.625 --> 03:24:11.583 line:82%
And I didn't even call you back.

1575
03:24:13.333 --> 03:24:16.667 line:82%
Why would you call me?
I should have come on my own.

1576
03:24:17.792 --> 03:24:20.167 line:82%
-Yes...
-I should have come on my own.

1577
03:24:21.167 --> 03:24:24.583 line:82%
Why didn't you come?
Why didn't you?

1578
03:24:25.208 --> 03:24:28.250 line:82%
This is your home...
You are the elder son of the family...

1579
03:24:28.417 --> 03:24:30.375 line:82%
You are my son... my son.

1580
03:24:34.083 --> 03:24:38.856 line:82%
And now I have grown old my son.

1581
03:24:43.042 --> 03:24:44.750 line:82%
I have grown old.

1582
03:24:47.875 --> 03:24:49.458 line:82%
At least forgive me now.

1583
03:24:52.125 --> 03:24:58.116 line:82%
At least forgive me
now... At least now.

1584
03:25:35.583 --> 03:25:36.796 line:82%
Come here, son.

1585
03:25:47.042 --> 03:25:47.958 line:82%
Son...

1586
03:25:50.375 --> 03:25:55.000 line:82%
At times the youngsters
in the house show the right...

1587
03:25:55.500 --> 03:25:57.458 line:82%
path to the elders in the family.

1588
03:25:59.792 --> 03:26:03.750 line:82%
I kept you away from your brother
for years.

1589
03:26:09.167 --> 03:26:13.296 line:82%
Please forgive me if you can.

1590
03:26:14.500 --> 03:26:16.956 line:82%
Forgive me... forgive me.
