1
00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:47.369 line:82%
Sorry, Ria.

2
00:00:49.298 --> 00:00:51.099 line:82%
I said, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:52.092 --> 00:00:56.098 line:82%
Being sorry doesn't
change anything, Sanjay.

4
00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.007 line:82%
Then tell me what I should do.

5
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.021 line:82%
There's nothing to be done.

6
00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:05.743 line:82%
That's my point, what can I do?

7
00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:07.109 line:82%
Shut up, Sanjay.

8
00:01:07.193 --> 00:01:10.149 line:82%
You'll never understand women.

9
00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:14.713 line:82%
I can try. Give me another chance?

10
00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:16.586 line:82%
Don't even talk to me.

11
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:21.908 line:82%
Say something, will you?

12
00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:25.663 line:82%
You just said, "Don't talk to me."

13
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:37.456 line:82%
You know what your problem is?

14
00:01:38.474 --> 00:01:40.209 line:82%
What's my problem?

15
00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:42.895 line:82%
You suck at relationships.

16
00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:51.195 line:82%
-I'm sorry, Ria.
-What the use in being sorry now?

17
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.033 line:82%
Ria don't be so mean, buddy.

18
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:56.450 line:82%
Can't you see I'm sad?

19
00:01:57.488 --> 00:01:58.503 line:82%
I'm very sad, Ria.

20
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:06.422 line:82%
I loved her so much.

21
00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.421 line:82%
And she dumped me, just like that.

22
00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.184 line:82%
It didn't take her even 20 minutes
to get over a 20-day affair.

23
00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:17.905 line:82%
Broke my heart.

24
00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:22.726 line:82%
Sonia, you hurt me.

25
00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:28.732 line:82%
My heart's broken. It's broken.

26
00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:35.489 line:82%
For the eighth time, Mr. Sanjay Malhotra,
over the last 11 months.

27
00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:40.369 line:82%
Now, get up and get over it.

28
00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:55.402 line:82%
Ria, listen! Hey, Ria!
Don't worry, I'm okay.

29
00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:59.325 line:82%
So, maybe eight girls did break
my heart over the last 11 months,

30
00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.867 line:82%
but it was only after I won theirs, right?

31
00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:03.392 line:82%
-What?
-Yes!

32
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.686 line:82%
Follow your heart
and you can change the world, Ria.

33
00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.398 line:82%
That's Sanjay and Ria,
but this isn't their story.

34
00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:12.443 line:82%
This is Sanjay's and Anjali's story.

35
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.945 line:82%
Sanju and Anju, who became friends

36
00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.950 line:82%
long before they knew
what friendship meant.

37
00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:23.932 line:82%
They just knew they couldn't live
without each other.

38
00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:35.350 line:82%
MERE YAAR KI SHAADI HAI

39
00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:36.086 line:82%
Hey, Prem, what's wrong?
Was touching her a crime?

40
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:38.534 line:82%
You also want what I want.

41
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:43.400 line:82%
Tell me, it's thrilling, isn't it?

42
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.235 line:82%
Not another word.

43
00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:50.976 line:82%
At my touch,
she becomes unworthy of you?

44
00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:53.604 line:82%
You care so much about her?

45
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.775 line:82%
Is she your fief,
your private property, what?

46
00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.043 line:82%
She's my friend.

47
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:04.490 line:82%
Your friend? Hear that?
Can guys and girls be friends?

48
00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:07.746 line:82%
See for yourself,
that's an example of friendship.

49
00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:11.795 line:82%
This is a good drama played out
in the name of friendship.

50
00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:14.208 line:82%
Prem...

51
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:21.048 line:82%
guys and girls can never be friends.
Actually it's a--

52
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:27.316 line:82%
You forgot the lines.
I win the bet, so you cook.

53
00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:31.141 line:82%
-I didn't lose.
-Oh, no?

54
00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:34.885 line:82%
Actually, I was just thinking...

55
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.940 line:82%
Thinking? About what?

56
00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:41.487 line:82%
See, this is a film, right?
It's different in films.

57
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.446 line:82%
Can guys and girls be friends
in real life?

58
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.866 line:82%
-I mean, just friends. What do you think?
-I don't think so.

59
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.538 line:82%
When a boy and a girl are friends,
somehow love always becomes a part of it.

60
00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:56.723 line:82%
Then, they either fall in love
or they part ways.

61
00:06:56.808 --> 00:06:58.829 line:82%
Either way,
the friendship is terminated.

62
00:06:58.902 --> 00:07:01.588 line:82%
What rubbish! Of course,
guys and girls can be friends.

63
00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:03.725 line:82%
Look at us. You are a girl, I'm a boy.

64
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:06.325 line:82%
Between us
there's none of this so-called love.

65
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.271 line:82%
-Now tell me.
-Listen.

66
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.192 line:82%
Our story is different.
We did go around for a week.

67
00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.966 line:82%
But I knew on day three

68
00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.830 line:82%
that nothing could be more foolish
than falling for you.

69
00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:18.358 line:82%
Get it?

70
00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:23.068 line:82%
Don't forget that Ria Chowdhury
was the first girl to dump you.

71
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:25.907 line:82%
Thank you. I'm obliged. I was spared.

72
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.159 line:82%
Like she's some beauty queen.
I'm special too.

73
00:07:30.252 --> 00:07:34.922 line:82%
Hello? Yes. May I know who is calling?
Just a moment please.

74
00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:36.540 line:82%
Mr. Malhotra,

75
00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.657 line:82%
if you can spare some time
from your busy schedule, it's for you.

76
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.754 line:82%
-For me? Who is it?
-Some Anjali.

77
00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:46.508 line:82%
Anju? Hey, Anju! What's up? How are you?

78
00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:49.867 line:82%
How was your trip? Was America fun?
How are your parents?

79
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.097 line:82%
And, what the hell, when did you get back?

80
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.677 line:82%
Okay, okay, Sanju.

81
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.771 line:82%
Number one, lots of things are up.
Number two, I'm fine.

82
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.283 line:82%
Number three, the trip was fantastic.

83
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:07.110 line:82%
America was fun.
Mummy and Daddy enjoyed themselves.

84
00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:10.547 line:82%
And, what the hell,
I got back from America three weeks ago.

85
00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:13.168 line:82%
What? Three weeks
and you're only calling me now?

86
00:08:13.252 --> 00:08:14.453 line:82%
This is ridiculous, buddy.

87
00:08:15.038 --> 00:08:17.748 line:82%
Anyway, I hope you didn't forget my list?

88
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.147 line:82%
Yes, I picked up everything.

89
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.618 line:82%
But hear me out first.
This is very important.

90
00:08:25.368 --> 00:08:26.590 line:82%
Yeah. Tell me.

91
00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:29.593 line:82%
-Sanju...
-Yes, tell me.

92
00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:33.972 line:82%
I'm getting married, Sanju.

93
00:08:34.357 --> 00:08:35.899 line:82%
What? You're getting married?

94
00:08:36.798 --> 00:08:38.969 line:82%
Yes, I'm getting married.

95
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.657 line:82%
The wedding is next month.
Everyone is coming.

96
00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.859 line:82%
You have to come too. At the earliest.

97
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.904 line:82%
You're... getting married?

98
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:51.615 line:82%
Oh, God!
You've always been a little slow.

99
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:55.660 line:82%
Don't waste any time, just pack
and take the first flight to Delhi.

100
00:08:55.744 --> 00:09:01.903 line:82%
If you aren't here by tomorrow evening...
Sanju, are you listening?

101
00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:04.586 line:82%
Yes, I'm just a little surprised.

102
00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:09.965 line:82%
It's not just you. Everyone's surprised.
Everything happened so fast.

103
00:09:10.607 --> 00:09:13.428 line:82%
Just come here,
I'll tell you everything. Okay?

104
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.135 line:82%
Okay. I'll try my best.

105
00:09:15.897 --> 00:09:17.266 line:82%
Try means try, huh?

106
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.913 line:82%
I'm a bit busy over the next few days.

107
00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:23.994 line:82%
Say hello to Anu and your parents.

108
00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:28.572 line:82%
Okay, Anjali. Take care, okay? Bye.

109
00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:32.134 line:82%
Shit.

110
00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:35.474 line:82%
I can't believe this.

111
00:09:37.534 --> 00:09:38.578 line:82%
She's getting married?

112
00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:40.080 line:82%
Who's doing what?

113
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.937 line:82%
Anju... Anjali is getting married.

114
00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:48.839 line:82%
Wow, that's great.
Wonderful news, right?

115
00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:53.722 line:82%
Yes, I'm glad,
I'm very happy, I'm thrilled.

116
00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.045 line:82%
-Doesn't seem like it.
-What rubbish.

117
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.783 line:82%
I'm glad, I'm very happy, I'm thrilled.
It's just a bit sudden, that's all.

118
00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:09.067 line:82%
Is she the same Anjali,
your childhood friend?

119
00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:13.016 line:82%
Childhood friend? Tell me about it.

120
00:10:13.732 --> 00:10:17.242 line:82%
Ever since she was four and I was five.

121
00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:19.773 line:82%
And we were always together.

122
00:10:20.445 --> 00:10:23.582 line:82%
School, college, we were buddies.

123
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:28.353 line:82%
How silly of Anjali...

124
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.621 line:82%
Does Anjali have a lovely smile?

125
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.139 line:82%
Thinking of her smiling makes me smile.

126
00:10:36.206 --> 00:10:38.123 line:82%
And your cheese omelets?

127
00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:40.474 line:82%
Ria, it's Anjali who makes
the real cheese omelets.

128
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:42.711 line:82%
In comparison, I suck at it.

129
00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:52.050 line:82%
But how come you...
How come you know all this about Anjali?

130
00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:53.445 line:82%
I know only bits and pieces.

131
00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:56.007 line:82%
But I'd like to know more.
Want to tell me?

132
00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:01.828 line:82%
-What do you want to know?
-About your friendship.

133
00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.984 line:82%
About your Anju.

134
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.041 line:82%
About Anju?

135
00:11:11.643 --> 00:11:12.714 line:82%
What can I tell you?

136
00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:19.756 line:82%

I'm wondering if I should tell you.

186
00:16:27.191 --> 00:16:28.294 line:82%
Why not?

187
00:16:28.373 --> 00:16:30.176 line:82%
You can't handle the truth.

188
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.368 line:82%
What rubbish. Tell me. What's the truth?

189
00:16:34.947 --> 00:16:36.002 line:82%
And you will hear me out?

190
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:41.224 line:82%
I will, most patiently. I won't scream,
I won't say, "What rubbish."

191
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:43.753 line:82%
Now, shoot.

192
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:49.459 line:82%
The truth is, you're in love with Anjali.

193
00:16:49.527 --> 00:16:50.593 line:82%
What rub--

194
00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:00.148 line:82%
I know, you think I'm talking rubbish.

195
00:17:00.221 --> 00:17:03.025 line:82%
Because you don't realize
you're in love with Anjali.

196
00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:05.650 line:82%
From Dehradoon to Bombay
you didn't take this trip alone.

197
00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:09.223 line:82%
Anjali came too, hidden in your heart.

198
00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:12.992 line:82%
And in every girl you met,
you tried to find Anjali.

199
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.819 line:82%
Sonia's hair reminded you of Anjali.

200
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:21.211 line:82%
Megha's cheese omelets were passable.

201
00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:28.136 line:82%
And Ria's smile was a little bit
like Anjali's, but not quite.

202
00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:31.468 line:82%
And how could you find another?
Anjali is one of a kind.

203
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:33.136 line:82%
And you know what?

204
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.973 line:82%
Every girl who looked into your eyes,

205
00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.286 line:82%
found not herself but someone else.

206
00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.173 line:82%
They saw Anjali.

207
00:17:42.705 --> 00:17:45.273 line:82%
Do you see, Mr. Sanjay Stupid Malhotra,

208
00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.687 line:82%
the absolute truth about your life.

209
00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:51.441 line:82%
That's absurd.

210
00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:55.366 line:82%
See? I didn't crack up.

211
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.557 line:82%
I didn't say, "What rubbish."

212
00:17:58.114 --> 00:18:01.167 line:82%
In spite of the fact that I've never heard
such a stupid theory.

213
00:18:01.257 --> 00:18:03.583 line:82%
I told you, you can't handle the truth.

214
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:04.667 line:82%
Shut up, buddy.

215
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.127 line:82%
You're getting irritated.

216
00:18:06.221 --> 00:18:08.379 line:82%
Anjali and me, how can you think that?

217
00:18:08.483 --> 00:18:10.298 line:82%
If you had any brains, you would too.

218
00:18:10.391 --> 00:18:12.300 line:82%
What rubbish.

219
00:18:12.393 --> 00:18:14.010 line:82%
Anjali and I are friends, period.

220
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.739 line:82%
There's no point in talking to you.

221
00:18:16.112 --> 00:18:17.524 line:82%
Listen to me.

222
00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.484 line:82%
I don't want to talk to you. Not a word.

223
00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:20.980 line:82%
I don't want to talk to you, either.

224
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.502 line:82%
Thank you. Good night.

225
00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:27.954 line:82%
I don't love Anjali. She's my friend!

226
00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:30.109 line:82%
She's my friend.

227
00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:31.311 line:82%
No one wants to listen.

228
00:18:31.964 --> 00:18:33.850 line:82%
I don't care if you don't want
to listen to me.

229
00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:38.740 line:82%
She's my friend!

230
00:19:03.089 --> 00:19:04.182 line:82%
You were right.

231
00:19:07.376 --> 00:19:08.407 line:82%
I love Anjali.

232
00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:21.693 line:82%
Men are dogs.

233
00:19:23.572 --> 00:19:24.956 line:82%
We're very selfish.

234
00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.497 line:82%
If you insist, I'll agree.

235
00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:33.635 line:82%
No, it's true.

236
00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.129 line:82%
Men are dogs.

237
00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.846 line:82%
We take things for granted so easily.

238
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.854 line:82%
And our convictions are so convenient.

239
00:19:47.266 --> 00:19:50.773 line:82%
I concluded so conveniently
that Anjali was mine.

240
00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:58.242 line:82%
I mean, she'd always be
where she was,

241
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:05.552 line:82%
waiting for me to marry her
when it was convenient for me.

242
00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:12.767 line:82%
I never considered that she was human.

243
00:20:14.562 --> 00:20:16.382 line:82%
That she had her own desires and dreams.

244
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:23.007 line:82%
But what if I'm not part of her dreams?

245
00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:30.186 line:82%
I never thought someone else
would come into her life.

246
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:39.465 line:82%
But how could Anjali know something
I never admitted to myself?

247
00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.137 line:82%
But how could I have told her?

248
00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:50.683 line:82%
I've only just now realizes
how dearly I love her.

249
00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:54.754 line:82%
Today...

250
00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.861 line:82%
when she's about to marry someone else.

251
00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:04.112 line:82%
I understand, Sanjay.

252
00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:08.406 line:82%
Sometimes you only know what you had
when it's gone.

253
00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:12.969 line:82%
What will you do now?

254
00:21:16.687 --> 00:21:17.735 line:82%
Take the 8:40 flight.

255
00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:25.243 line:82%
You're going... to Dehradoon?

256
00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.006 line:82%
Yeah.

257
00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:31.909 line:82%
Sanjay...

258
00:21:33.309 --> 00:21:37.547 line:82%
I know it'll be hard for you
to see this wedding happen.

259
00:21:39.569 --> 00:21:43.761 line:82%
Anjali is about to marry
someone else and you're...

260
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.307 line:82%
I'm so proud of you.

261
00:21:50.733 --> 00:21:54.022 line:82%
Ria, you don't understand.
Yes, I'm going,

262
00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:59.118 line:82%
but not to attend the wedding,
I'm going lo break it up.

263
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.824 line:82%
-What?
-Yeah.

264
00:22:02.673 --> 00:22:06.701 line:82%
Anjali is about to get married,
she hasn't done it yet.

265
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.494 line:82%
I'm the one she's gonna marry.

266
00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:15.735 line:82%
Because, if you follow your heart...

267
00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:17.672 line:82%
You can change the world.

268
00:22:18.206 --> 00:22:22.925 line:82%
-Exactly.

Anjali is like a daughter to you.

276
00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:37.278 line:82%
That's why, Vishnu.
I will hold this against you forever.

277
00:23:37.385 --> 00:23:42.088 line:82%
I'm her uncle, and you finalized
her wedding without consulting me?

278
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:43.502 line:82%
My goodness.

279
00:23:43.586 --> 00:23:46.330 line:82%
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

280
00:23:46.434 --> 00:23:50.638 line:82%
You think I'm overreacting?
You judge, who's the older brother?

281
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:53.443 line:82%
-You are my older brother.
-And I'm older than you are.

282
00:23:54.146 --> 00:23:56.102 line:82%
-I approved this match.
-Look, Mother.

283
00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:59.877 line:82%
-What's your problem?
-You're always butting in.

284
00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:02.223 line:82%
Shut up and touch the sacred fires.

285
00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:04.170 line:82%
Then give your brother a hug.

286
00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:07.860 line:82%
-Come on, brother.
-You'll get a beating someday.

287
00:24:08.698 --> 00:24:11.450 line:82%
Mother, I knew my husband
was a little afraid of you

288
00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:14.754 line:82%
but my brother-in-law too?

289
00:24:15.288 --> 00:24:18.512 line:82%
No, his wife scares him more.

290
00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:23.566 line:82%
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Pull down the wall, I say.

291
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.887 line:82%
Ma, if the door isn't facing east...

292
00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:32.887 line:82%
Mother-in-law, you want to pull down walls
just for the wedding?

293
00:24:33.496 --> 00:24:36.100 line:82%
My dear anglicized son-in-law,

294
00:24:36.184 --> 00:24:39.597 line:82%
I'd rather tear down walls
than defy the scriptures.

295
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.357 line:82%
Grooms never enter from the west.
Good God, it's sacrilege.

296
00:24:43.441 --> 00:24:48.057 line:82%
So what, Kappo? Lord Rama entered
from the west when he was wed.

297
00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:51.824 line:82%
-How's that?
-Ayodhya is west of Mithila.

298
00:24:51.908 --> 00:24:53.016 line:82%
How could you forget?

299
00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:59.081 line:82%
How could you forget, dear brother,
that Lord Rama was exiled for 14 years.

300
00:24:59.165 --> 00:25:03.082 line:82%
Had he observed the scriptures
Lord Rama would've been fine.

301
00:25:03.639 --> 00:25:05.628 line:82%
Can you match that?

302
00:25:05.711 --> 00:25:09.175 line:82%
Our sister-in-law is matchless.

303
00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:12.426 line:82%
I've finally convinced him.

304
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:17.837 line:82%
I wonder if I could've
convinced him to get married.

305
00:25:20.599 --> 00:25:23.189 line:82%
Anju's wedding is going to be fun.

306
00:25:23.882 --> 00:25:26.422 line:82%
My sister-in-law happens to be
everyone's favorite.

307
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.945 line:82%
And our wedding was not less grand.

308
00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:33.960 line:82%
Yes, but there's no sign of that guy
who entertained everyone at your wedding.

309
00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:36.098 line:82%
-Who?
-Sanju.

310
00:25:36.162 --> 00:25:37.218 line:82%
Yes!

311
00:25:47.338 --> 00:25:50.683 line:82%
You escaped from the Aunt, fatso.
I'll pull your hair and make you short.

312
00:25:54.929 --> 00:25:56.821 line:82%
-Bahadur Singh!
-Yes, ma'am.

313
00:25:58.691 --> 00:25:59.850 line:82%
-Bahadur Singh?
-Yes.

314
00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:01.938 line:82%
-Are the gates clean?
-Yes.

315
00:26:02.411 --> 00:26:04.355 line:82%
Plant some new saplings.

316
00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:06.031 line:82%
You said the prayers without me?

317
00:26:06.823 --> 00:26:07.851 line:82%
Sanju!

318
00:26:12.907 --> 00:26:14.824 line:82%
Sorry, girlfriend, I'm late.

319
00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:18.064 line:82%
Not that late. There's still a lot to do.

320
00:26:19.178 --> 00:26:20.663 line:82%
That's what I'm here for.

321
00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:22.044 line:82%
-Hey, Sanju.
-Hello, Uncle!

322
00:26:22.128 --> 00:26:23.457 line:82%
There you are.

323
00:26:24.101 --> 00:26:25.626 line:82%
Very good. Very good.

324
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.472 line:82%
-All set?
-All upset.

325
00:26:28.555 --> 00:26:31.007 line:82%
The engagement is next Sunday,
and everyone is in an uproar

326
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.010 line:82%
I'm going into the office.
You take care of everything.

327
00:26:34.093 --> 00:26:35.330 line:82%
Is everyone here?

328
00:26:35.415 --> 00:26:37.852 line:82%
-Uncle, aunt...?
-Both

329
00:26:37.937 --> 00:26:42.533 line:82%
-I'm gonna make my entrance.
-You rascal, go in, I'll join you.

330
00:26:43.434 --> 00:26:45.896 line:82%
Uncle Shankar, bring in Sanjay's luggage.

331
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.537 line:82%
-I'll be back in two hours.
-No, please...

332
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.068 line:82%
Hey, girl, I'm gonna pull your hair.

333
00:26:51.152 --> 00:26:54.198 line:82%
-Hey, buddy
-Hey, buddy. Get back.

334
00:26:54.273 --> 00:26:57.041 line:82%
-Hi, Sanju, how are you?
-Good!

335
00:26:57.134 --> 00:27:01.120 line:82%
First, have you found someone
who can straighten you out?

336
00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:02.445 line:82%
A nice girl, like me?

337
00:27:02.538 --> 00:27:07.376 line:82%
What can I say? You married this
angry young man and broke my heart.

338
00:27:08.753 --> 00:27:12.923 line:82%
But I did find someone.
Now, I hear she's getting married too.

339
00:27:13.226 --> 00:27:15.384 line:82%
Oh, poor Sanju.

340
00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:19.740 line:82%
-Is she a nice girl?
-Nice? She's mind-blowing.

341
00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:24.393 line:82%
-What? More mind-blowing than me?
-How is that possible?

342
00:27:24.852 --> 00:27:27.139 line:82%
She's a little like you.

343
00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:30.027 line:82%
She could be your little sister.

344
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.904 line:82%
But what does it matter now?

345
00:27:38.827 --> 00:27:40.623 line:82%
That boy is incorrigible.

346
00:27:40.701 --> 00:27:46.499 line:82%
-My obeisances to the aunt.
-Bless you.

347
00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:50.060 line:82%
Aren't you a little early
for a post-wedding appearance?

348
00:27:50.134 --> 00:27:53.798 line:82%
I would have come earlier,
but black cat crossed my path.

349
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:57.359 line:82%
-Goodness! What happened?
-I took a detour to get here.

350
00:27:57.443 --> 00:28:01.840 line:82%
-It was the right thing to do.
-Forget that, tell me something.

351
00:28:01.904 --> 00:28:05.059 line:82%
-Have you seen Anju?
-I'll see her soon.

352
00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:08.604 line:82%
Meet her before I leave.
I mean, I have to go out.

353
00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:12.060 line:82%
-Hi, Sanjay.
-Hi, brother-in-law. How are you?

354
00:28:12.153 --> 00:28:13.222 line:82%
-How are you?
-Good.

355
00:28:13.305 --> 00:28:15.244 line:82%
How's Wall Street treating you?

356
00:28:15.328 --> 00:28:18.114 line:82%
-Cool. Anjali is upstairs.
-Upstairs. Anjali.

357
00:28:18.197 --> 00:28:20.086 line:82%
-Yes, go on.
-Go on.

358
00:28:20.169 --> 00:28:21.450 line:82%
Uncle Sanju.

359
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:24.723 line:82%
Hi, Kutkut, you recognized me?

360
00:28:24.829 --> 00:28:29.491 line:82%
-Yes, and Grandpa wants to see you.
-Good Lord.

361
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:32.663 line:82%
-Obeisances, uncle.
-Save the obeisances for later.

362
00:28:32.727 --> 00:28:35.881 line:82%
Did you get married secretly in Bombay?

363
00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:38.162 line:82%
-Good Lord.
-Good Lord.

364
00:28:38.265 --> 00:28:40.615 line:82%
I could never get married
without your approval.

365
00:28:41.709 --> 00:28:43.931 line:82%
Look at him, how understanding.

366
00:28:44.014 --> 00:28:49.812 line:82%
What a good boy. And then there's Anjali.
Have you seen Anjali yet?

367
00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:54.817 line:82%
-Sanju, you haven't seen Anjali yet?
-No, Nilu.

368
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.755 line:82%
But why is everyone going on about Anjali?

369
00:28:58.102 --> 00:29:00.865 line:82%
-Sanju, what's this I hear?
-Hello, Grandma.

370
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:03.889 line:82%
Bless you. You haven't seen Anju yet?

371
00:29:03.973 --> 00:29:06.120 line:82%
I will, please sit down.

372
00:29:06.203 --> 00:29:08.664 line:82%
-What's the hurry?
-But of course...

373
00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:11.459 line:82%
Sanju, there you are.
Anjali is waiting for you.

374
00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:13.921 line:82%
-Where?
-Upstairs. Come on.

375
00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:17.006 line:82%
-Let me say hi to everyone.
-Later. Now come along.

376
00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:20.153 line:82%
Come on, we've been waiting for you.

377
00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:23.839 line:82%
I mean, Anjali's been waiting.

378
00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:26.951 line:82%
-Waiting for me. Why?
-How should I know?

379
00:29:27.683 --> 00:29:29.902 line:82%
That's between you and Anjali.

380
00:29:29.977 --> 00:29:32.935 line:82%
Go on, she's waiting. Excuse me.

381
00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:45.075 line:82%
Now, he's ﬂoored.

382
00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:47.341 line:82%
Anjali.

383
00:29:56.694 --> 00:29:59.507 line:82%
Today, little Anju, you've had it.

384
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:00.849 line:82%
You just wait.

385
00:30:04.476 --> 00:30:07.221 line:82%
Getting smart with Sanju?

386
00:30:07.304 --> 00:30:09.433 line:82%
Today, I'm gonna beat you!

387
00:30:09.517 --> 00:30:12.668 line:82%
You won't get away from me. Scared?

388
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:14.957 line:82%
-You dog, you.
-What is it?

389
00:30:15.741 --> 00:30:17.107 line:82%
-Come. Come on.
-What?

390
00:30:17.191 --> 00:30:18.296 line:82%
What?

391
00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:21.529 line:82%
-Anju.
-Sanju.

392
00:30:23.434 --> 00:30:26.742 line:82%
-You won't get away from me now.
-Come on, come on.

393
00:30:29.168 --> 00:30:30.204 line:82%
Yes.

394
00:30:32.688 --> 00:30:33.715 line:82%
Got you.

395
00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:54.492 line:82%
-They're a nice couple, no?
-Yes.

396
00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:01.819 line:82%
Could've been better.
Could've been you.

397
00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:06.388 line:82%
That's what I always thought.

398
00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:14.873 line:82%
Whatever we may think,
marriages are made in heaven.

399
00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.236 line:82%
It could've been different.

400
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.379 line:82%
Nilu could've been my Aunt Nilu.

401
00:31:28.387 --> 00:31:33.267 line:82%
If you're in love,
why is the heart afraid of love?

402
00:31:36.812 --> 00:31:38.822 line:82%
Greetings, sister-in-law.

403
00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:40.441 line:82%
-How are you?
-Hello, Mr. Khanna.

404
00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:42.610 line:82%
Weren't you supposed to come tomorrow?

405
00:31:42.693 --> 00:31:44.733 line:82%
I can leave if you want.

406
00:31:45.724 --> 00:31:48.157 line:82%
I just couldn't stay away.

407
00:31:48.824 --> 00:31:51.652 line:82%
I went to Delhi for few days,
but I couldn't stay there.

408
00:31:52.286 --> 00:31:56.607 line:82%
-Where's our girl? Where's Anjali?
-Anju!

409
00:31:56.692 --> 00:31:58.667 line:82%
-I'm here.
-There she is.

410
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:02.331 line:82%
-Samosas. For you.
-Bless you.

411
00:32:03.816 --> 00:32:06.884 line:82%
No. First, what did you bring from Delhi?

412
00:32:06.967 --> 00:32:09.618 line:82%
Is she blackmailing me?

413
00:32:09.722 --> 00:32:12.306 line:82%
Wait till you're married.
Then I'll make you

414
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:14.411 line:82%
cook hot samosas for me every day.

415
00:32:14.478 --> 00:32:18.020 line:82%
I could, but your son, the doctor,
will he let you eat fried food?

416
00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:19.178 line:82%
That's a good point.

417
00:32:19.249 --> 00:32:22.948 line:82%
Between you, me, and the samosas,
how did that fool crop up?

418
00:32:23.022 --> 00:32:24.234 line:82%
Uncle.

419
00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:29.171 line:82%
When will Rohit get here?

420
00:32:29.245 --> 00:32:31.950 line:82%
-Sanjay, come here.
-Yes.

421
00:32:32.636 --> 00:32:37.873 line:82%
-Sanjay is Mr. Malhotra's son.
-The late Mr. Malhotra?

422
00:32:38.374 --> 00:32:39.967 line:82%
-The one whose house I bought?
-Yes.

423
00:32:40.482 --> 00:32:44.226 line:82%
So, you're Sanjay.
I was hoping to meet you.

424
00:32:45.113 --> 00:32:47.247 line:82%
We've never met,
but I know your entire history.

425
00:32:47.851 --> 00:32:49.760 line:82%
Anju talks about you all the time.

426
00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:53.284 line:82%
When she's over she's always saying,
"This was Sanju's room,

427
00:32:53.357 --> 00:32:57.142 line:82%
this is where we played carom,"
so on and so forth.

428
00:32:58.435 --> 00:33:01.400 line:82%
Please come over someday.
It's your house.

429
00:33:01.927 --> 00:33:03.911 line:82%
It was. Now it's yours.

430
00:33:04.954 --> 00:33:08.487 line:82%
Anjali still calls it Sanju's house.

431
00:33:09.863 --> 00:33:12.551 line:82%
Silly, She doesn't even realize
where she's going.

432
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.937 line:82%
Excuse me.

433
00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:18.599 line:82%
After Mr. Malhotra died in the accident,
he moved to Bombay.

434
00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:20.736 line:82%
He's doing well.

435
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:25.066 line:82%
I wonder sometimes, destiny is strange.

436
00:33:25.838 --> 00:33:31.106 line:82%
He was motherless,
then, at 20, he lost his father too.

437
00:33:32.302 --> 00:33:33.562 line:82%
But he didn't break down.

438
00:33:35.863 --> 00:33:36.974 line:82%
He's a brave kid.

439
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.078 line:82%
I like that boy.

440
00:33:40.561 --> 00:33:43.694 line:82%
-It's still here?
-Yes!

441
00:33:44.314 --> 00:33:48.586 line:82%
Last year, there was talk of cutting down
the branch. I cried for three days.

442
00:33:49.147 --> 00:33:52.301 line:82%
I went on a hunger strike for two days,
and Papa relented.

443
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:56.091 line:82%
Why didn't you let him cut it down
if he wants?

444
00:33:56.486 --> 00:33:59.663 line:82%
How could I? You made this swing.

445
00:34:00.497 --> 00:34:06.044 line:82%
Remember, we sat on this swing for hours
and plotted our mischief.

446
00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:09.798 line:82%
-Come on, sit.
-I hope it doesn't break.

447
00:34:10.549 --> 00:34:13.831 line:82%
If it hasn't broken in all these years,
why would it break now? Come.

448
00:34:18.432 --> 00:34:21.737 line:82%
You see?
Old stuff doesn't let you down.

449
00:34:25.314 --> 00:34:28.799 line:82%
-Go on, ask.
-What?

450
00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.322 line:82%
I know what your tricky head is full of.

451
00:34:34.527 --> 00:34:39.286 line:82%
-And what's that?
-Questions, countless questions.

452
00:34:39.808 --> 00:34:43.040 line:82%
-About him.
-Who's him?

453
00:34:44.047 --> 00:34:49.129 line:82%
About Rohit, you fool. Who else?
Everyone is asking about him.

454
00:34:50.212 --> 00:34:51.924 line:82%
But I haven't told anyone anything.

455
00:34:52.806 --> 00:34:55.761 line:82%
Because I wanted you
to be the first to know.

456
00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:02.750 line:82%
Rohit. Where do I begin?

457
00:35:05.255 --> 00:35:08.607 line:82%
Last year, Rohit's father came to live
in your house.

458
00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:11.238 line:82%
Did Papa tell you about that?

459
00:35:13.327 --> 00:35:14.863 line:82%
Rohit has never been here.

460
00:35:15.485 --> 00:35:18.408 line:82%
He lives in America. He's a doctor.

461
00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:20.978 line:82%
His father is very nice.

462
00:35:21.909 --> 00:35:23.664 line:82%
He started socializing with us.

463
00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:28.689 line:82%
His house was always like a second home
to me, since we were kids.

464
00:35:30.824 --> 00:35:34.299 line:82%
Everyone was worried
about my trip to America.

465
00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:39.304 line:82%
Uncle Khanna said, there's no need
to worry since Rohit is there.

466
00:35:40.264 --> 00:35:43.697 line:82%
That reassured Papa, but I was so nervous.

467
00:35:45.764 --> 00:35:47.688 line:82%
Remember, I called you from the airport?

468
00:35:49.189 --> 00:35:52.213 line:82%
The prospect of traveling to America
all alone was so daunting.

469
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:55.796 line:82%
You were the one who gave me the courage.

470
00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.142 line:82%
If it wasn't for your encouragement,

471
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:03.487 line:82%
I might never have met Rohit.

472
00:36:10.085 --> 00:36:12.041 line:82%
Only a fool shoots himself in the leg,

473
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:14.593 line:82%
and I stepped right into the line of fire.

474
00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:17.981 line:82%
I couldn't know then.

475
00:36:18.944 --> 00:36:23.724 line:82%
I never expected that a few days
with Rohit would lead to this.

476
00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:28.318 line:82%
We had just met each other,

477
00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:31.286 line:82%
we had barely gotten to know each other

478
00:36:32.154 --> 00:36:33.942 line:82%
when his father made the proposal.

479
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:37.626 line:82%
Papa asked me and I said yes.

480
00:36:38.822 --> 00:36:43.035 line:82%
And now,
we're getting ready for a wedding.

481
00:36:44.912 --> 00:36:47.838 line:82%
Sanju, I need your encouragement again.

482
00:36:48.916 --> 00:36:50.993 line:82%
I'm so nervous.

483
00:36:52.294 --> 00:36:54.064 line:82%
I'm getting married for the first time.

484
00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:00.362 line:82%
But you're here now and I know
everything is going to be fine.

485
00:37:01.178 --> 00:37:03.755 line:82%
My wedding is going to be a memorable one.

486
00:37:05.028 --> 00:37:08.310 line:82%
-Anjali, come here.
-Coming, sister.

487
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:24.092 line:82%
It'll be a memorable wedding,
for sure.

488
00:37:26.503 --> 00:37:30.499 line:82%
Neither you nor Rohit will ever forget it.

489
00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:35.669 line:82%
Don't worry. Next time.

490
00:37:38.123 --> 00:37:39.841 line:82%
You can't do anything.

491
00:37:39.925 --> 00:37:42.807 line:82%
-Have some paan.
-Paan? Thanks, Sanju.

492
00:37:42.881 --> 00:37:44.346 line:82%
I've had a word with the priest.

493
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.982 line:82%
The kulfi supplier is confirmed at 5,500.

494
00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:48.612 line:82%
Perfect. And look...

495
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:51.695 line:82%
Bagged the queen already?

496
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.994 line:82%
Don't worry.
He still needs a cover for score.

497
00:37:54.648 --> 00:37:56.621 line:82%
Here you go.

498
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.241 line:82%
Uncle, bad luck. You lost your queen.

499
00:38:04.658 --> 00:38:08.018 line:82%
-That's nothing new for him.
-What do you mean?

500
00:38:09.461 --> 00:38:12.089 line:82%
Ignore him.
Put your heart into the game.

501
00:38:12.162 --> 00:38:14.543 line:82%
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.

502
00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:16.144 line:82%
What's on your mind?

503
00:38:16.228 --> 00:38:18.755 line:82%
-Rohit.
-What about Rohit?

504
00:38:19.161 --> 00:38:22.718 line:82%
Unlike you, I know nothing about him.

505
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:24.636 line:82%
What's to know? He's a doctor?

506
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.438 line:82%
-Where?
-In America.

507
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:27.764 line:82%
Where in America?

508
00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:30.952 line:82%
Do you have an address?
A telephone number? Something?

509
00:38:31.026 --> 00:38:32.602 line:82%
Anjali would know.

510
00:38:32.686 --> 00:38:35.599 line:82%
Is that all you care for her?

511
00:38:37.149 --> 00:38:40.657 line:82%
He wanted to be fully satisfied
about the two of you.

512
00:38:41.469 --> 00:38:43.864 line:82%
While you were wailing for approval,

513
00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:46.490 line:82%
he was investigating you thoroughly.

514
00:38:47.784 --> 00:38:51.645 line:82%
Before the wedding was finalized,
he knew every detail about you.

515
00:38:52.287 --> 00:38:53.707 line:82%
Your photo?

516
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:59.773 line:82%
Your photo was vetted
by even the most distant relative.

517
00:38:59.846 --> 00:39:01.506 line:82%
Only then was the wedding fixed.

518
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:06.930 line:82%
Naturally, it's a brother's duty
to vet his sister's prospective suitors.

519
00:39:07.024 --> 00:39:12.142 line:82%
-And how have you investigated Rohit?
-You don't even have his numbers.

520
00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:14.916 line:82%
Sanju, think before you speak.

521
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.147 line:82%
Sorry, I said what I felt was right.

522
00:39:19.276 --> 00:39:20.567 line:82%
It's strange, isn't it?

523
00:39:21.314 --> 00:39:25.405 line:82%
They're about to get married
and no one has even seen the boy's photo.

524
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.417 line:82%
Well, modern times. Carry on.

525
00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.974 line:82%
Look, it's fine. He's from a nice family.

526
00:39:34.037 --> 00:39:35.999 line:82%
Oh, yeah? And we were from bad ones?

527
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:38.642 line:82%
No, I mean, his parents are nice.

528
00:39:38.735 --> 00:39:40.145 line:82%
And our parents were not?

529
00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:42.506 line:82%
-No, no, look...
-What are you saying?

530
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:45.620 line:82%
-No, no, uncle. Absolutely not.
-Don't shout. Don't shout.

531
00:39:46.043 --> 00:39:49.262 line:82%
-A photo. Let us see.
-Show us a photo.

532
00:39:49.346 --> 00:39:50.717 line:82%
Quiet, I'm telling you.

533
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.810 line:82%
Why are the kids bothering you, Anjali?

534
00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:57.521 line:82%
-She won't show us his photo.
-Whose photo?

535
00:39:57.604 --> 00:40:00.015 line:82%
-Her fiancé's.
-I don't have any photos.

536
00:40:00.078 --> 00:40:01.691 line:82%
Yes, she does.

537
00:40:01.775 --> 00:40:03.318 line:82%
Uncle, please tell them.

538
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.862 line:82%
Kids, don't harass her.
Leave her alone. Run off.

539
00:40:07.345 --> 00:40:08.782 line:82%
Come on, sit beside me.

540
00:40:11.952 --> 00:40:13.961 line:82%
-Come on, show it to me.
-What?

541
00:40:14.704 --> 00:40:16.886 line:82%
-Your fiancé's photo.
-Uncle!

542
00:40:17.624 --> 00:40:19.184 line:82%
Show us, girl.

543
00:40:19.686 --> 00:40:23.088 line:82%
In my time, I went to town
with your grandfather's photo.

544
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:26.638 line:82%
I showed him off to everyone,
the barber, the tailor, the confectioner.

545
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:28.376 line:82%
How nice.

546
00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:33.014 line:82%
You'll see Rohit when he gets here
the day after tomorrow.

547
00:40:33.098 --> 00:40:34.149 line:82%
Listen to that.

548
00:40:34.232 --> 00:40:37.394 line:82%
You can wait till then if you like.

549
00:40:37.477 --> 00:40:42.566 line:82%
Or you could come to Sanju, the magic man.

550
00:40:46.528 --> 00:40:47.736 line:82%
The groom's photo.

551
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:49.823 line:82%
How did he get his hands on it?

552
00:40:49.906 --> 00:40:51.052 line:82%
Rohit's photo?

553
00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:53.813 line:82%
Where did you find it?

554
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.035 line:82%
I know every inch of your room.

555
00:40:58.438 --> 00:40:59.541 line:82%
I want to see it first.

556
00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:01.004 line:82%
Okay, quiet!

557
00:41:02.002 --> 00:41:04.838 line:82%
-I'll show you.
-Sanju, don't you dare.

558
00:41:05.795 --> 00:41:10.510 line:82%

-Perfect.

609
00:46:19.889 --> 00:46:21.362 line:82%
-Whose wedding is it?
-Rohit's.

610
00:46:21.446 --> 00:46:22.705 line:82%
-Who's arriving?
-Rohit.

611
00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:24.199 line:82%
Then Rohit gets the red carpet.

612
00:46:24.282 --> 00:46:29.792 line:82%
Move it. Not that way. Get lost.
Wonder why they selected him.

613
00:47:13.456 --> 00:47:14.777 line:82%
One minute.

614
00:47:18.711 --> 00:47:23.242 line:82%
-Strange. No obeisances?
-Good Lord.

615
00:47:23.316 --> 00:47:25.635 line:82%
Greetings.

616
00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:30.603 line:82%
Bless you.

617
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:35.105 line:82%
Grandma, I wanted to pay
my respects to you first.

618
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.983 line:82%
Bless me that I may imbibe,
at least in part...

619
00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:44.191 line:82%
the ethics and the morality
that you have taught everyone.

620
00:47:45.405 --> 00:47:47.532 line:82%
So be it, child.

621
00:47:50.034 --> 00:47:52.036 line:82%
-Obeisances, uncle.
-May you live long.

622
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.015 line:82%
-Aunt.
-Long live.

623
00:47:54.721 --> 00:47:59.502 line:82%
On my way, I carried oblations
from the temple of the Mother Goddess.

624
00:48:01.796 --> 00:48:05.448 line:82%
Aunt, this book is for you. Feng shui.

625
00:48:06.412 --> 00:48:07.552 line:82%
What's that?

626
00:48:08.236 --> 00:48:10.893 line:82%
Ancient scriptures from China.

627
00:48:10.967 --> 00:48:12.974 line:82%
-Scriptures!
-Your favorite, right?

628
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:15.231 line:82%
Wonderful. May you live long.

629
00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:25.792 line:82%
Uncle, were I a son in this house
instead of a son-in-law,

630
00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:31.749 line:82%
you'd surely expect
that before I pay my respects to you,

631
00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:36.581 line:82%
I would pay my respects to grandmother
and then to uncle and aunt.

632
00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:43.880 line:82%
That's why... I hope I wasn't wrong.

633
00:48:44.005 --> 00:48:45.795 line:82%
No.

634
00:48:47.717 --> 00:48:48.891 line:82%
Bless you.

635
00:48:50.011 --> 00:48:51.114 line:82%
It's okay.

636
00:48:53.348 --> 00:48:55.219 line:82%
Bless you, son.

637
00:48:55.695 --> 00:48:57.226 line:82%
Welcome, Mr. Khanna.

638
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.658 line:82%
Come, please.

639
00:48:58.731 --> 00:48:59.896 line:82%
Let's go inside.

640
00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:07.964 line:82%
Very good.

641
00:49:08.051 --> 00:49:09.572 line:82%
Neelu, here as well.

642
00:49:10.323 --> 00:49:12.533 line:82%
Yeah, there is a huge
terrace garden upstairs.

643
00:49:12.617 --> 00:49:15.143 line:82%
-Oh, my God.
-Huge place, man. And there...

644
00:49:16.302 --> 00:49:18.039 line:82%
Eternal bachelor, Uncle Lachu, right?

645
00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:19.441 line:82%
Quite right.

646
00:49:20.299 --> 00:49:24.087 line:82%
Will you never enter the sea?
Will you only watch from the shore?

647
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:29.409 line:82%
Why drown yourself to learn what
someone else's mistakes can teach you?

648
00:49:30.218 --> 00:49:31.651 line:82%
Well said, uncle.

649
00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:35.596 line:82%
Sanjay.

650
00:49:36.307 --> 00:49:37.739 line:82%
I'll just be back.

651
00:49:40.403 --> 00:49:42.093 line:82%
You must be Sanjay.

652
00:49:42.176 --> 00:49:43.231 line:82%
Yes. Hi.

653
00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:46.007 line:82%
Hi. I was looking forward
to seeing you, buddy.

654
00:49:48.192 --> 00:49:52.949 line:82%
Sanjay Malhotra.
Second most closest guy to Anjali.

655
00:49:53.032 --> 00:49:54.160 line:82%
First.

656
00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:56.119 line:82%
You're the second.

657
00:49:57.578 --> 00:49:59.187 line:82%
Cool, I like your attitude, man.

658
00:50:00.586 --> 00:50:02.417 line:82%
You're just like Anjali described you.

659
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.693 line:82%
By the way, where is Anjali?

660
00:50:20.983 --> 00:50:21.989 line:82%
Lord...

661
00:50:23.229 --> 00:50:24.318 line:82%
Rohit?

662
00:50:24.397 --> 00:50:25.773 line:82%
...I'm here now.

663
00:50:26.733 --> 00:50:29.193 line:82%
Don't let this silly girl
pester you any longer.

664
00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:32.111 line:82%
She can ask me for anything she wants.

665
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.611 line:82%
Rohit, what are you doing here?

666
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.358 line:82%
Like you, I'm praying.

667
00:50:38.828 --> 00:50:40.022 line:82%
Rohit.

668
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.179 line:82%
It doesn't feel right for you to be here.

669
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:45.156 line:82%
Anjali.

670
00:50:46.711 --> 00:50:47.782 line:82%
Don't worry.

671
00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:50.458 line:82%
I asked your grandmother's permission.

672
00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:54.398 line:82%
-What have you done?
-I've fallen in love with you.

673
00:50:57.782 --> 00:51:01.267 line:82%
-Now what do you want?
-I've traveled a long way.

674
00:51:03.085 --> 00:51:04.353 line:82%
I should be rewarded.

675
00:51:05.234 --> 00:51:09.358 line:82%
A small hug. Half a kiss. Something.

676
00:51:10.526 --> 00:51:14.347 line:82%
Mr. Rohit Khanna. you're in a temple.

677
00:51:14.864 --> 00:51:18.624 line:82%
Oblations is all you'll get here.

678
00:51:23.122 --> 00:51:26.826 line:82%
I'm making do, Lord,
but you must intercede.

679
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:28.544 line:82%
What rubbish.

680
00:51:28.628 --> 00:51:31.653 line:82%
How can he be better you?
Sanjay is the best.

681
00:51:32.253 --> 00:51:35.927 line:82%
No, Ria. I was overconfident.

682
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:38.805 line:82%
But I don't compare to him.

683
00:51:38.888 --> 00:51:40.518 line:82%
Nothing. Zero.

684
00:51:41.858 --> 00:51:43.768 line:82%
That's what he said to me too.

685
00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:50.887 line:82%
I think I might make up an excuse
and leave tomorrow.

686
00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:52.081 line:82%
Sanju...

687
00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:54.882 line:82%
Sanju, listen to me.

688
00:51:55.786 --> 00:51:56.844 line:82%
Is Anjali there?

689
00:51:58.564 --> 00:51:59.645 line:82%
Where else would she be?

690
00:51:59.742 --> 00:52:03.751 line:82%
I mean, is she there with you?
Can you see her?

691
00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:09.332 line:82%
Yes, I can see her.

692
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:11.087 line:82%
Only Anjali?

693
00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:27.139 line:82%
Do you see what you're leaving behind?
You did it once.

694
00:52:27.937 --> 00:52:30.834 line:82%
If you do it second time,
will you be able to forgive yourself?

695
00:52:32.108 --> 00:52:34.479 line:82%
Do you still want to come back?

696
00:52:35.987 --> 00:52:40.244 line:82%
No, not without Anjali.

697
00:52:40.917 --> 00:52:42.618 line:82%
And what about Rohit?

698
00:52:44.453 --> 00:52:49.542 line:82%
Rohit? Forget it, Ria.
Sanjay is the best.

699
00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:59.677 line:82%
There you are, Sanju. Anu and Rajesh
are expecting you for breakfast.

700
00:53:00.289 --> 00:53:03.764 line:82%
-They're serving stuffed fried pancakes.
-I prefer this.

701
00:53:03.848 --> 00:53:07.481 line:82%
Put that back.
It's an offering to the gods.

702
00:53:07.565 --> 00:53:08.895 line:82%
Girlfriend.

703
00:53:10.883 --> 00:53:11.898 line:82%
Okay.

704
00:53:14.053 --> 00:53:17.194 line:82%
Go see Anjali. She hasn't had breakfast.

705
00:53:17.278 --> 00:53:19.951 line:82%
She isn't out of bed. What's she up to?

706
00:53:21.908 --> 00:53:24.076 line:82%
-Say it again.
-Anjali.

707
00:53:26.554 --> 00:53:30.917 line:82%
My name sounds so different
when you say it.

708
00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:33.589 line:82%
Say my full name.

709
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:35.326 line:82%
Anjali Sharma.

710
00:53:35.421 --> 00:53:37.748 line:82%
No stupid, not this one.

711
00:53:38.966 --> 00:53:40.358 line:82%
The name I'm going to have.

712
00:53:43.678 --> 00:53:48.100 line:82%
Anjali Khanna. Mrs. Anjali R. Khanna.

713
00:53:48.201 --> 00:53:51.103 line:82%
Anju, your mother wants you downstairs.

714
00:53:51.187 --> 00:53:54.131 line:82%
Rohit, I'll have to hang up now,
okay? Bye.

715
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.871 line:82%
Okay.

716
00:53:56.502 --> 00:53:57.652 line:82%
Hang up.

717
00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.556 line:82%
No, you hang up.

718
00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:04.779 line:82%
I can't hang up until you hang up.

719
00:54:05.593 --> 00:54:06.827 line:82%
Hang up.

720
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.888 line:82%
No, you.

721
00:54:12.747 --> 00:54:14.001 line:82%
I told you.

722
00:54:14.877 --> 00:54:18.219 line:82%
Let's do it on the count of three.

723
00:54:19.715 --> 00:54:20.933 line:82%
One.

724
00:54:21.717 --> 00:54:22.899 line:82%
Two.

725
00:54:23.636 --> 00:54:24.709 line:82%
Three.

726
00:54:25.137 --> 00:54:26.681 line:82%
You also didn't hang up.

727
00:54:28.432 --> 00:54:31.102 line:82%
-Oh, Rohit, you're crazy.
-Crazy.

728
00:54:34.146 --> 00:54:35.773 line:82%
How many times?

729
00:54:36.649 --> 00:54:37.845 line:82%
I love you.

730
00:54:39.443 --> 00:54:40.675 line:82%
Hang up. Please.

731
00:54:41.917 --> 00:54:44.907 line:82%
Hang up.

732
00:54:44.991 --> 00:54:46.617 line:82%
Done. Now, come on.

733
00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:50.878 line:82%
Hung up?

734
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.874 line:82%
I scream, you scream.
Hey, girls. How are you doing?

735
00:54:53.958 --> 00:54:55.760 line:82%
-Cool, man.
-Exactly the same.

736
00:54:55.833 --> 00:54:59.005 line:82%
Okay, this is mine.

737
00:54:59.547 --> 00:55:01.751 line:82%
-Rohit, your chocolate.
-Thanks.

738
00:55:01.842 --> 00:55:04.135 line:82%
And, ma'am, your boring strawberry.

739
00:55:04.802 --> 00:55:06.164 line:82%
Why is it boring?

740
00:55:07.077 --> 00:55:10.683 line:82%
You'll only find out
if you ever try another flavor.

741
00:55:10.756 --> 00:55:13.102 line:82%
Have you ever tried anything
other than strawberry?

742
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:18.406 line:82%
It's not your fault, though.
It's your life that's boring.

743
00:55:19.025 --> 00:55:22.967 line:82%
Look at me, some black currant,
some mango, dash of mint.

744
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:26.901 line:82%
Lollipop, also.
Variety, my dear, is the spice of life.

745
00:55:27.867 --> 00:55:30.119 line:82%
Right? What do you say, Rohit?

746
00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:35.558 line:82%
But, actually, when I look at you,
I think your life's boring too.

747
00:55:36.459 --> 00:55:41.141 line:82%
Don't mind, but I'm sure Anjali
is the first and only girl in your life.

748
00:55:41.235 --> 00:55:42.304 line:82%
Of course not.

749
00:55:45.051 --> 00:55:50.147 line:82%
You mean you've had girlfriends?
Before Anjali?

750
00:55:50.241 --> 00:55:52.600 line:82%
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes.

751
00:55:55.019 --> 00:55:56.036 line:82%
Wow.

752
00:55:56.479 --> 00:55:59.717 line:82%
Great, dude. Looks can be quite deceptive.

753
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:01.649 line:82%
Rohit? Girlfriend?

754
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.472 line:82%
What do you mean, girlfriends?

755
00:56:06.906 --> 00:56:09.988 line:82%
Girlfriends are girls who are friends.

756
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:14.710 line:82%
But more girl than friend, right?

757
00:56:18.167 --> 00:56:21.432 line:82%
Rohit, how come I've never heard
about your girlfriends?

758
00:56:22.071 --> 00:56:26.217 line:82%
Maybe because... You don't know?

759
00:56:26.922 --> 00:56:29.720 line:82%
You never told her? Very bad.

760
00:56:29.804 --> 00:56:34.074 line:82%
I wanted to tell you, but you aid
you weren't interested in my past.

761
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.575 line:82%
Okay. Fine. I wasn't. Now I am.

762
00:56:38.671 --> 00:56:40.773 line:82%
Yes, me too. Go on, tell us.

763
00:56:41.524 --> 00:56:45.820 line:82%
Fine, anyway our relationship
is based on truth.

764
00:56:46.612 --> 00:56:49.098 line:82%
Ask whatever you want.
You have the right to know.

765
00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:53.661 line:82%
-Well--
-Well, for starters, Mr. Rohit Khanna,

766
00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:57.857 line:82%
what I, we want to know is,
how many girlfriends?

767
00:56:57.948 --> 00:56:59.050 line:82%
Yeah.

768
00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:02.253 line:82%
-Let me think.
-Yes, go on.

769
00:57:02.336 --> 00:57:05.826 line:82%
I think, four. No, actually, five.

770
00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:11.896 line:82%
Five? How long ago was the fifth?

771
00:57:13.139 --> 00:57:15.501 line:82%
About three months.

772
00:57:16.128 --> 00:57:19.854 line:82%
When you were seeing me,
you already had a girlfriend?

773
00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:22.119 line:82%
Yes, but...

774
00:57:23.584 --> 00:57:27.361 line:82%
when I saw you for the first time
I realized that you were the girl

775
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:29.462 line:82%
I wanted to spend my life with.

776
00:57:31.282 --> 00:57:33.808 line:82%
I told her, and she understood.

777
00:57:34.368 --> 00:57:37.188 line:82%
Really? That's so amazing.

778
00:57:37.606 --> 00:57:40.833 line:82%
Come on, Anjali.
Why get worked up over that?

779
00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:46.981 line:82%
Everyone has a past. It's natural.
If you had a past, I wouldn't get upset.

780
00:57:48.042 --> 00:57:50.759 line:82%
Anjali's past. I'm Anjali's past.

781
00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:54.430 line:82%
In her boring life,
there was no friend, except me.

782
00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:56.557 line:82%
So there's no chance
of your getting upset.

783
00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:01.530 line:82%
Sanjay, stay out of it.
Listen, Rohit, I'm really hurt, okay.

784
00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:04.190 line:82%
You shouldn't have hidden it from me.

785
00:58:04.273 --> 00:58:05.503 line:82%
What's there to hide?

786
00:58:06.011 --> 00:58:07.568 line:82%
Why didn't you tell me?

787
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:11.223 line:82%
What's there to tell, Anjali?

788
00:58:11.322 --> 00:58:14.935 line:82%
Nothing to be said and nothing to hide?
What's this all about?

789
00:58:15.019 --> 00:58:17.912 line:82%
-Nothing. It's nothing, Anjali--
-Nothing?

790
00:58:18.696 --> 00:58:24.043 line:82%
My fiancé has had five affairs
and I didn't know about it until now?

791
00:58:24.126 --> 00:58:26.849 line:82%
Three happened when I was in school.
We were kids.

792
00:58:26.939 --> 00:58:28.254 line:82%
I don't want to hear anything.

793
00:58:30.299 --> 00:58:32.493 line:82%
Come on, Anjali, people are staring.

794
00:58:32.579 --> 00:58:34.136 line:82%
Okay. Fine.

795
00:58:34.637 --> 00:58:38.224 line:82%
I don't want to embarrass you
even one more minute, Mr. Rohit Khanna.

796
00:58:39.228 --> 00:58:41.685 line:82%
-I'm going.
-You can't be serious.

797
00:58:41.769 --> 00:58:43.299 line:82%
-Sanju.
-Anju.

798
00:58:43.938 --> 00:58:46.607 line:82%
Sanju, will you drive me home
or shall I go on my own?

799
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:50.903 line:82%
Can't I finish my ice cream?
No. Okay.

800
00:58:50.986 --> 00:58:53.670 line:82%
Anjali, Anjali.

801
00:58:53.764 --> 00:58:56.922 line:82%
No hard feelings, buddy. Got to go. Sorry.

802
00:58:58.532 --> 00:59:01.080 line:82%
No, I'm sorry.

803
00:59:02.957 --> 00:59:04.500 line:82%
My fault.

804
00:59:06.393 --> 00:59:08.671 line:82%
No, Rohit, it's not your fault,

805
00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:11.079 line:82%
but I have to do it.

806
00:59:12.591 --> 00:59:19.075 line:82%
You're so nice,
but that's also why you have to die.

807
00:59:22.601 --> 00:59:27.769 line:82%
You gotta go, Rohit. Away from Anjali.
Far away. Forever.

808
00:59:29.735 --> 00:59:30.813 line:82%
Goodbye.

809
00:59:44.373 --> 00:59:45.642 line:82%
Poor guy.

810
00:59:47.543 --> 00:59:48.794 line:82%
He was a nice guy.

811
00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:56.844 line:82%
Hey, you. Take it easy, man.

812
00:59:57.594 --> 00:59:59.193 line:82%
Come on. Get up.

813
01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:01.460 line:82%
Thanks, buddy.

814
01:00:01.822 --> 01:00:03.770 line:82%
-I should be thanking you.
-Really?

815
01:00:04.584 --> 01:00:08.299 line:82%
You played a major role in cementing
my relationship with Anjali.

816
01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:10.065 line:82%
How come?

817
01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:16.397 line:82%
In America, Anjali told me
about the swing you rigged up for her.

818
01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:19.263 line:82%
It's a cherished childhood memory for her.

819
01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:23.204 line:82%
-So, guess what I did.
-What?

820
01:00:23.273 --> 01:00:27.541 line:82%
I rigged up a swing too
and I decorated it with flowers.

821
01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:32.744 line:82%
I kept her eyes shut as I took her to
the swing, and that's when I asked her,

822
01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:36.900 line:82%
"Anjali, will you marry me?"

823
01:00:38.807 --> 01:00:42.564 line:82%
She opened her eyes, saw the swing,

824
01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:45.917 line:82%
and she gave me a small smile.

825
01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:54.109 line:82%
I'm still not sure
if she was smiling at me or the swing.

826
01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:57.004 line:82%
The swing, of course.

827
01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:00.282 line:82%
Sanju, you also...

828
01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:03.077 line:82%
Yesterday, Anjali behaved badly with you.

829
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.474 line:82%
If I were you, I'd stop talking to her.

830
01:01:06.123 --> 01:01:10.709 line:82%
-What? I was about to call her.
-Don't be silly.

831
01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:14.046 line:82%
Have you seen Rajesh?
You'll end up like him. Hen-pecked.

832
01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.840 line:82%
-Take my advice, you needn't call her.
-Why?

833
01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:20.135 line:82%
What do you mean why? She fought with you.
Let her call and apologize.

834
01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:24.604 line:82%
-But, Sanjay...
-Trust me, I know her.

835
01:01:24.678 --> 01:01:26.014 line:82%
Don't say anything.

836
01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.036 line:82%
Tonight, at the engagement,
she'll apologize.

837
01:01:29.129 --> 01:01:30.604 line:82%
-It's not your fault
-I know.

838
01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.905 line:82%
-Here.
-Yes, I'm doing that.

839
01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.765 line:82%
How about a light massage?

840
01:01:38.859 --> 01:01:40.187 line:82%
-Look at him.
-It's the way he is.

841
01:01:40.714 --> 01:01:43.033 line:82%
What did Rohit say today on the phone?

842
01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:46.278 line:82%
Nothing.

843
01:01:46.362 --> 01:01:49.275 line:82%
-Surely he said something.
-He hasn't called until now.

844
01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.545 line:82%
-Doesn't he call every morning?
-Except for this morning.

845
01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:58.118 line:82%
-Maybe he's out jogging...
-No. He returned an hour ago.

846
01:01:58.939 --> 01:02:02.369 line:82%
-Was he all right?
-He was just fine.

847
01:02:02.911 --> 01:02:07.599 line:82%
Said he'd had a good night's sleep.
He was looking very fresh.

848
01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:11.770 line:82%
-I think he's still annoyed at me.
-Yes, he is.

849
01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:16.525 line:82%
-That's why he never called.
-Just like a typical man.

850
01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:22.656 line:82%
He's not crazy, like me. In his place,
I would've called ten times already.

851
01:02:23.288 --> 01:02:26.160 line:82%
I would've realized my mistake
and I would've apologized.

852
01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.134 line:82%
But not Rohit, he'll never do that.

853
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.081 line:82%
Because he knows

854
01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:35.105 line:82%
if he takes the first step,
you will always have the upper hand.

855
01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:37.838 line:82%
And he's not one to be hen-pecked.

856
01:02:39.298 --> 01:02:40.717 line:82%
He's so smart.

857
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.471 line:82%
I could never be as clever.
When I get married,

858
01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:48.392 line:82%
I'll be totally hen-pecked.

859
01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:50.083 line:82%
Always.

860
01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:53.937 line:82%
That's for me? Thank you.

861
01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.817 line:82%
You wanted to call him, didn't you?

862
01:02:59.518 --> 01:03:03.447 line:82%
Go ahead and apologize.
He isn't made of stone. He'll forgive you.

863
01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:06.575 line:82%
Why should Anjali apologize?

864
01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:09.912 line:82%
Rohit is at fault. He's the one who made
a mountain out of a molehill yesterday.

865
01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:14.920 line:82%
Anu, he's Anjali's fiancé.
She can misbehave with her friends.

866
01:03:15.013 --> 01:03:18.962 line:82%
-She can do it with, me, but Rohit--
-I can do it to Rohit too.

867
01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.633 line:82%
And you shouldn't take Rohit's side.

868
01:03:23.417 --> 01:03:25.219 line:82%
Whose friend are you? Mine or his?

869
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.256 line:82%
And for your kind information,

870
01:03:28.352 --> 01:03:32.434 line:82%
I won't to talk to him unless he calls me.

871
01:03:33.066 --> 01:03:34.728 line:82%
Tell your clever friend that.

872
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.088 line:82%
But, Anjali...

873
01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:39.718 line:82%
Anu...

874
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.444 line:82%
Sanjay, you're a genius.

875
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.460 line:82%
Nice couple.

876
01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:05.287 line:82%
Could be nicer.

877
01:04:06.802 --> 01:04:11.431 line:82%
Could be someone else.
Could be... you?

878
01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:19.147 line:82%
Didn't I tell you,
marriages are made in heaven.

879
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:26.837 line:82%
And I say, follow your heart
and you can change the world.

880
01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:30.258 line:82%
Meaning?

881
01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:34.037 line:82%
It's just an engagement.

882
01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:38.745 line:82%
Who knows if it will culminate
in a wedding?

883
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.795 line:82%
I don't understand.

884
01:04:44.423 --> 01:04:48.725 line:82%

That's right. We have to decide all this

How about we get dinner started?

931
01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:47.289 line:82%
-Let's go!
-Come. Let's go.

932
01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:50.941 line:82%
What?

933
01:07:58.158 --> 01:08:00.126 line:82%
And they're not even married yet.

934
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:04.130 line:82%
Well done, nephew. Wonderful.

935
01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:11.016 line:82%
But why party so far away?

936
01:08:11.771 --> 01:08:16.468 line:82%
Bachelor parties are best done on the sly.

937
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:17.796 line:82%
But why?

938
01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:21.473 line:82%
Because the men get so rowdy

939
01:08:21.556 --> 01:08:25.060 line:82%
that if we women find out,
the men have had it.

940
01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.311 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

941
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.769 line:82%
-Will there be song and dance?
-And women.

942
01:08:32.138 --> 01:08:37.504 line:82%
My sister-in-law says
you have to see one of these parties

943
01:08:37.596 --> 01:08:41.830 line:82%
to see what scoundrels men can be.

944
01:08:42.564 --> 01:08:44.412 line:82%
Then I'm going, for sure.

945
01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:49.423 line:82%
He may look innocent, but who knows,
your brother might be a scoundrel.

946
01:08:51.041 --> 01:08:54.881 line:82%
I'm going too.
I want to see what Naren is up to.

947
01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:58.635 line:82%
I also need to keep an eye on Raju.
Then there's Rohit.

948
01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:04.063 line:82%
They say that the bachelor
is allowed to do just about anything.

949
01:09:04.167 --> 01:09:05.760 line:82%
Let's see what Rohit demands.

950
01:09:06.685 --> 01:09:08.061 line:82%
Yay, now we're talking.

951
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:10.008 line:82%
Wonderful party.

952
01:09:10.091 --> 01:09:12.957 line:82%
Come on. Let's cheers to Rohit!

953
01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:17.343 line:82%
No, cheers to Sanjay.
He organized this party.

954
01:09:18.095 --> 01:09:20.407 line:82%
All right, it's all the same.
One and the same thing.

955
01:09:20.492 --> 01:09:21.658 line:82%
No, no, uncle.

956
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:24.286 line:82%
-You...
-You have to have some.

957
01:09:24.369 --> 01:09:26.688 line:82%
You're getting too restless.

958
01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:28.331 line:82%
Look.

959
01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:32.877 line:82%
-Have a smoke. I'll be right back.
-Uncle, and after that...

960
01:09:36.298 --> 01:09:38.269 line:82%
This is called life.

961
01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:39.769 line:82%
Cheers.

962
01:09:40.302 --> 01:09:41.379 line:82%
Cigarette?

963
01:09:42.854 --> 01:09:46.224 line:82%
Ajit too? What a revelation.

964
01:09:46.308 --> 01:09:48.124 line:82%
Now, I know.

965
01:09:48.226 --> 01:09:51.412 line:82%
Sanju said it'd be a lively party.

966
01:09:51.475 --> 01:09:53.841 line:82%
I know, where are the babes?

967
01:09:53.925 --> 01:09:55.442 line:82%
I can't wait!

968
01:09:56.059 --> 01:09:57.661 line:82%
You people are strange.

969
01:09:57.744 --> 01:10:00.570 line:82%
Be patient and you will be rewarded.

970
01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:04.117 line:82%
I can't wait.

971
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.104 line:82%
At this grievous juncture,

972
01:10:06.157 --> 01:10:11.374 line:82%
before another bachelor
falls to the blade of matrimony,

973
01:10:11.435 --> 01:10:15.045 line:82%
from me and the brotherhood of bachelors,

974
01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:18.007 line:82%
here is a requiem
in the words of Mr. Sanjay Malhotra.

975
01:10:18.093 --> 01:10:21.509 line:82%
"My friend is getting married,
but I'm not happy.

976
01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:26.292 line:82%
Love culminates in marriage,
but I'm far from happy.

977
01:10:27.539 --> 01:10:30.685 line:82%
I stopped him,
I tried to reason with him.

978
01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:34.494 line:82%
For friendship's sake, I told him.

979
01:10:35.607 --> 01:10:38.011 line:82%
I posed obstacles for him.
I lay a thorn in his path.

980
01:10:38.895 --> 01:10:40.946 line:82%
Like a blossom, I even tried wilting.

981
01:10:42.213 --> 01:10:45.116 line:82%
He's walking away
with the most beautiful flower of spring.

982
01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:49.147 line:82%
It's like a wedding in Eden,
but I'm far from happy.

983
01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:53.299 line:82%
At my friend's wedding, I'm unhappy.

984
01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:57.671 line:82%
Love culminates in marriage,
but I'm far from happy."

985
01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.317 line:82%

Hi, Rohit.

1026
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.055 line:82%
Here? All of a sudden?
What are you doing here?

1027
01:17:24.076 --> 01:17:25.483 line:82%
I've been thinking, Sanjay.

1028
01:17:27.477 --> 01:17:31.862 line:82%
Ever since I came here,
something or other has been going wrong.

1029
01:17:32.456 --> 01:17:35.735 line:82%
Wrong? I haven't noticed anything.

1030
01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:42.200 line:82%
Neither did I, until now.
But like I said...

1031
01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:47.076 line:82%
-I've been thinking.
-And?

1032
01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:52.330 line:82%
After much deliberation,
I've come to a conclusion.

1033
01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:56.509 line:82%
Someone's behind all this.

1034
01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:03.763 line:82%
Someone is trying, very systematically,
to break up our relationship.

1035
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:06.265 line:82%
What are you talking about?

1036
01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:10.520 line:82%
Someone is determined...

1037
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.401 line:82%
to stop me from marrying Anjali.

1038
01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:18.940 line:82%
Really?

1039
01:18:21.652 --> 01:18:22.727 line:82%
Who could it be?

1040
01:18:22.824 --> 01:18:25.553 line:82%
"I stopped him,
I even tried to reason with him.

1041
01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:29.845 line:82%
For friendship's sake, I told him.

1042
01:18:31.082 --> 01:18:33.685 line:82%
I posed obstacles for him,
I lay a thorn in his path.

1043
01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:36.712 line:82%
Like a blossom, I even tried wilting.

1044
01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:40.602 line:82%
My friend is getting married,
but I'm not happy.

1045
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:43.386 line:82%
Love culminates in marriage, but..."

1046
01:18:46.264 --> 01:18:47.657 line:82%
Why aren't you happy, Sanjay?

1047
01:18:50.017 --> 01:18:53.881 line:82%
You are the one who doesn't
want this wedding to happen.

1048
01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:57.675 line:82%
But why?

1049
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:01.921 line:82%
There can be only one reason.

1050
01:19:04.449 --> 01:19:06.330 line:82%
You're in love with Anjali.

1051
01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:11.941 line:82%
Come on, pal, admit it.

1052
01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.350 line:82%
We're friends, you can tell me.

1053
01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:23.734 line:82%
Yes.

1054
01:19:27.305 --> 01:19:28.803 line:82%
I love Anjali.

1055
01:19:29.599 --> 01:19:33.519 line:82%
Now, that's like a true love.

1056
01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:41.917 line:82%
Well, now that it's out in the open,
what should we do?

1057
01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:50.062 line:82%
Actually, for you, it's quite simple.

1058
01:19:51.072 --> 01:19:53.664 line:82%
Now that you know everything,

1059
01:19:53.748 --> 01:19:59.812 line:82%
I think you should just leave.
Go back to America.

1060
01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:01.779 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

1061
01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:05.051 line:82%
Anyway this story is of me and Anjali.

1062
01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.617 line:82%
You just came out of nowhere.

1063
01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:12.099 line:82%
You understand, right?
Anjali doesn't love you.

1064
01:20:13.476 --> 01:20:15.818 line:82%
Anjali doesn't love me?

1065
01:20:16.938 --> 01:20:20.239 line:82%
Look, for her,
you're just a stand-in for me.

1066
01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:22.777 line:82%
Into my house.

1067
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.364 line:82%
She went to America because I told her to.

1068
01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:28.293 line:82%
The swing was mine too.

1069
01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:30.570 line:82%
Understand?

1070
01:20:31.687 --> 01:20:36.541 line:82%
In our story, you're my understudy.

1071
01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.545 line:82%
Now, that I'm here,
there's no need for you.

1072
01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.669 line:82%
So pack, go back to America.

1073
01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:48.382 line:82%
You don't even need to tell anyone.

1074
01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:51.514 line:82%
I'm here. I'll handle everything.

1075
01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.271 line:82%
Sure, you'll handle everything.

1076
01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:02.957 line:82%
But taking your advice
might be a bit problematic.

1077
01:21:03.044 --> 01:21:06.153 line:82%
Tell me, I'll solve your problem.

1078
01:21:06.237 --> 01:21:10.665 line:82%
After all, I'm Sanjay, the magic man.
So, what's the problem?

1079
01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:15.178 line:82%
The problem is, I love Anjali too.

1080
01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:19.380 line:82%
I can't walk away from her,

1081
01:21:21.252 --> 01:21:25.920 line:82%
certainly not
when I'm the one she wants to marry.

1082
01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:30.695 line:82%
That's her mistake, Rohit.
I'll make her happier than you can.

1083
01:21:33.272 --> 01:21:34.974 line:82%
That's what you think, Sanjay.

1084
01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:41.997 line:82%
But there's only one way to decide
where happiness lies for Anjali.

1085
01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:44.729 line:82%
How?

1086
01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:50.162 line:82%
You love her and I love her too.

1087
01:21:52.199 --> 01:21:53.603 line:82%
Let's both try it.

1088
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:58.372 line:82%
You don't ask me to go away,
I won't ask you to go away.

1089
01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:02.405 line:82%
You can do whatever you want.

1090
01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:08.966 line:82%
If you succeed,
then I'll assume Anjali was never mine.

1091
01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:11.463 line:82%
If you fail,

1092
01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:17.101 line:82%
then it'll be clear that Anjali and I
share that eternal relationship.

1093
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:22.271 line:82%
Why are you wasting your time?
You're a nice guy.

1094
01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:27.339 line:82%
Why do you care about Anjali?
You can get any girl.

1095
01:22:29.654 --> 01:22:33.532 line:82%
No, Sanjay, there's only one Anjali...

1096
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:39.343 line:82%
and she can belong to only one of us.

1097
01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:43.015 line:82%
Whose, only time can tell.

1098
01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:48.255 line:82%
Oh yes, I have one advantage.

1099
01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:53.608 line:82%
I'm marrying her in a week.

1100
01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:58.413 line:82%
You're running out of time.

1101
01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:03.068 line:82%
I have 22 years behind me.

1102
01:23:04.735 --> 01:23:06.176 line:82%
You're the one lagging way behind.

1103
01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:11.329 line:82%
-You're gonna lose.
-We'll see.

1104
01:24:26.604 --> 01:24:30.163 line:82%
I warned you. The planetary alignment
for the engagement was inauspicious.

1105
01:24:30.676 --> 01:24:34.779 line:82%
The boy isn't to blame.
He was influenced by the illusions.

1106
01:24:35.502 --> 01:24:38.365 line:82%
-We found out in time--
-Sister-in-law.

1107
01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:43.250 line:82%
I'd rather this wasn't discussed.

1108
01:24:44.176 --> 01:24:47.750 line:82%
Without a discussion,
how can we arrive at any conclusions?

1109
01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:49.292 line:82%
It's not the case, Aunt.

1110
01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:55.281 line:82%
Will I be given a chance to defend myself?

1111
01:25:02.473 --> 01:25:08.437 line:82%
What you saw was true,
but not the reality.

1112
01:25:10.397 --> 01:25:14.081 line:82%
I did it, but I wasn't myself.

1113
01:25:17.104 --> 01:25:21.575 line:82%
The circumstances and the ambiance
were such that

1114
01:25:23.661 --> 01:25:26.969 line:82%
I thought, if so many people
were trying to make me happy,

1115
01:25:28.499 --> 01:25:32.508 line:82%
I should join them
so as not to offend them.

1116
01:25:35.548 --> 01:25:37.508 line:82%
I could've walked out...

1117
01:25:41.046 --> 01:25:42.346 line:82%
and left them heartbroken.

1118
01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:47.031 line:82%
But in my folly, I broke the heart of...

1119
01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.692 line:82%
the man who treated me like his own son.

1120
01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:58.724 line:82%
Well, what are the facts, Uncle?

1121
01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:04.341 line:82%
The fact is, you saw me disgrace myself.

1122
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:11.145 line:82%
But there's another truth.
No one means more to me than Anjali.

1123
01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:16.847 line:82%
And a much bigger truth,
Anjali trusts me

1124
01:26:18.228 --> 01:26:20.426 line:82%
and wants to spend her life with me.

1125
01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:28.739 line:82%
And yet another truth, Uncle.
You treated me like your own son.

1126
01:26:33.814 --> 01:26:35.482 line:82%
But can I ever be your son?

1127
01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:41.954 line:82%
If I were, you would've forgiven me.

1128
01:26:54.627 --> 01:26:57.229 line:82%
If you won't give me your forgiveness,

1129
01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:01.508 line:82%
I'll never be able to face myself again.

1130
01:27:05.054 --> 01:27:06.700 line:82%
Never.

1131
01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:26.501 line:82%
You can look anyone in the eye.

1132
01:27:28.953 --> 01:27:32.483 line:82%
After all, you are my son.

1133
01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:10.789 line:82%
What happened?

1134
01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:14.429 line:82%
Don't worry, everything's okay.

1135
01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:16.974 line:82%
Uncle has forgiven Rohit.

1136
01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:21.797 line:82%
I knew. I just knew it.
Rohit would bring him around.

1137
01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:25.939 line:82%
That's just who Rohit is, don't you think?

1138
01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:37.684 line:82%
Sanju, in all these days,
you still haven't told me.

1139
01:28:38.772 --> 01:28:40.176 line:82%
What do you think of Rohit?

1140
01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:43.581 line:82%
Go on, tell me.

1141
01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:48.005 line:82%
It's a big decision. I took it on my own.

1142
01:28:49.152 --> 01:28:51.785 line:82%
What do you think? Was I right?

1143
01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:56.122 line:82%
Tell me, Sanju,
what do you think of Rohit?

1144
01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:03.839 line:82%
Rohit is a nice guy, Anju.

1145
01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:10.271 line:82%
Great guy. He'll make you happy.

1146
01:29:14.016 --> 01:29:16.727 line:82%
-Knock, knock.
-Rohit?

1147
01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:22.980 line:82%
What did you do to bring Papa around?

1148
01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:26.326 line:82%
I fell in love with you.

1149
01:29:28.572 --> 01:29:31.185 line:82%
-What do you want?
-Love.

1150
01:29:32.257 --> 01:29:34.870 line:82%
Why? Couldn't find it
at the bachelor party?

1151
01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:51.602 line:82%
I never imagined you'd admit defeat
so soon.

1152
01:29:56.750 --> 01:30:02.106 line:82%
You praised me to the skies.
Honestly, I was surprised.

1153
01:30:03.487 --> 01:30:04.650 line:82%
How to explain this?

1154
01:30:06.293 --> 01:30:08.362 line:82%
Deep inside the scoundrel Sanjay Malhotra,

1155
01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:11.338 line:82%
there lives a nice,
noble Sanjay Malhotra too.

1156
01:30:13.008 --> 01:30:18.080 line:82%
But it takes Anjali's tears
to bring him out.

1157
01:30:19.832 --> 01:30:24.895 line:82%
Like you, he's also a fool,
being honest, being truthful.

1158
01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:27.700 line:82%
But it's only a matter of a few minutes...

1159
01:30:30.534 --> 01:30:32.219 line:82%
and those few minutes are over.

1160
01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:40.070 line:82%
Which leaves this Sanjay Malhotra,
cunning, conniving.

1161
01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:44.328 line:82%
So wipe that smile off your face, Rohit.

1162
01:30:46.693 --> 01:30:48.026 line:82%
The war is on.

1163
01:30:48.547 --> 01:30:49.694 line:82%
Interesting.

1164
01:30:52.156 --> 01:30:55.868 line:82%
So, this is going to be even more fun.
Guess why.

1165
01:30:58.787 --> 01:31:01.449 line:82%
Tomorrow will be three months
that Anjali and I are together.

1166
01:31:02.935 --> 01:31:04.043 line:82%
I'm going to take her out.

1167
01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:09.363 line:82%
She says, "Impossible,"
and I say, "You have your magic man.

1168
01:31:10.315 --> 01:31:11.430 line:82%
He'll bring you to me."

1169
01:31:13.478 --> 01:31:14.735 line:82%
Why is that so interesting?

1170
01:31:15.637 --> 01:31:20.474 line:82%
Well, Anjali is about to beg you,

1171
01:31:22.179 --> 01:31:23.520 line:82%
and how will you refuse her?

1172
01:31:25.403 --> 01:31:26.681 line:82%
That'll be interesting.

1173
01:31:28.358 --> 01:31:32.487 line:82%
Besides, the wedding
is only six days away, Sanjay.

1174
01:31:34.609 --> 01:31:35.695 line:82%
Only six days.

1175
01:31:36.423 --> 01:31:38.979 line:82%
The earth spins around the sun six times
in six days, Rohit.

1176
01:31:40.572 --> 01:31:41.676 line:82%
Six times.

1177
01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:49.708 line:82%
Cool. I like your attitude.
All the best.

1178
01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:55.260 line:82%
You keep spinning your planet
while I decorate my world.

1179
01:31:58.639 --> 01:32:00.307 line:82%
My wedding is just six days away, buddy.

1180
01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:08.697 line:82%
Come on, Sanju.

1181
01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:13.288 line:82%
Enough talk. Six days?

1182
01:32:23.247 --> 01:32:24.514 line:82%
Oh, God!

1183
01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.434 line:82%
Well, there you are.

1184
01:32:30.954 --> 01:32:33.131 line:82%
Neither the car nor I can go any further.

1185
01:32:35.512 --> 01:32:37.219 line:82%
From here you walk alone.

1186
01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:43.809 line:82%
You're nervous,
your heart is pounding

1187
01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:47.069 line:82%
because you don't know
what's about to happen.

1188
01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:52.311 line:82%
What's he going to do?
What should you be doing?

1189
01:32:53.777 --> 01:32:55.821 line:82%
Your heart is pounding, isn't it?

1190
01:33:03.241 --> 01:33:05.789 line:82%
My heart would, too, if I were you.

1191
01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:08.142 line:82%
And what would you do?

1192
01:33:11.196 --> 01:33:14.464 line:82%
For a moment,
imagine being in love with me.

1193
01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:18.850 line:82%
Okay.

1194
01:33:20.197 --> 01:33:25.017 line:82%
For a moment,
let me imagine I'm in love with you.

1195
01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.009 line:82%
What would you do?

1196
01:33:29.731 --> 01:33:31.106 line:82%
Okay, Anju.

1197
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:35.360 line:82%
If you say so, I'll live a whole lifetime
in one moment.

1198
01:33:36.653 --> 01:33:39.823 line:82%
Tell me Sanju, what would you do?

1199
01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:42.707 line:82%
I...

1200
01:33:46.288 --> 01:33:47.706 line:82%
would come close to you...

1201
01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:54.129 line:82%
without taking my eyes off yours,
like this.

1202
01:33:55.172 --> 01:33:59.137 line:82%
-I'd keep looking at you.
-Then?

1203
01:34:01.511 --> 01:34:07.976 line:82%
Your eyes would hold mine,
your hands would be in mine.

1204
01:34:09.186 --> 01:34:13.467 line:82%
-We would be so close.
-And?

1205
01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:20.305 line:82%
And I'd carry you away
in the wind to the rustle of the leaves

1206
01:34:21.365 --> 01:34:25.926 line:82%
and bathe you in a lake of dew
and in a quiet moment,

1207
01:34:27.788 --> 01:34:30.661 line:82%
I'd whisper in your ear...

1208
01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.427 line:82%
Whisper what?

1209
01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:36.089 line:82%
I'd whisper...

1210
01:34:37.381 --> 01:34:38.793 line:82%
What?

1211
01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:41.552 line:82%
I'd whisper...

Sanju?

Anju, help!

1255
01:41:00.914 --> 01:41:01.973 line:82%
Anju!

1256
01:41:02.515 --> 01:41:05.548 line:82%
-Sanju?
-I just fell out of a tree, Anju.

1257
01:41:10.683 --> 01:41:11.729 line:82%
Yes!

1258
01:41:12.325 --> 01:41:13.443 line:82%
It hurts too much, Anju.

1259
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:15.346 line:82%
Sanju.

1260
01:41:16.324 --> 01:41:18.531 line:82%
Anju, help me.

1261
01:41:18.615 --> 01:41:20.914 line:82%
Why is the car going backwards? Anju?

1262
01:41:20.987 --> 01:41:24.370 line:82%
Rohit, what are you up to?
You're going to get me killed.

1263
01:41:24.454 --> 01:41:27.128 line:82%
Help me. Help me, someone. Mommy!

1264
01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:32.587 line:82%
Sanjay!

1265
01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:35.437 line:82%
Let me sleep, Ria. No work today, Ria.

1266
01:41:36.132 --> 01:41:37.799 line:82%
-Sanjay.
-Ria?

1267
01:41:39.385 --> 01:41:41.679 line:82%
-Sanjay, where are you?
-Oh, no.

1268
01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:44.999 line:82%
Sanjay! Sanjay!

1269
01:41:45.558 --> 01:41:48.715 line:82%
Why is everyone staring at me?
I'd like to see Sanjay.

1270
01:41:48.812 --> 01:41:49.938 line:82%
Ria?

1271
01:41:50.634 --> 01:41:54.275 line:82%
San-- Oh, there you are.

1272
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.695 line:82%
Sleeping in till 10:00? As usual.

1273
01:41:56.778 --> 01:41:58.241 line:82%
Ria?

1274
01:41:58.738 --> 01:42:00.076 line:82%
Yes, me.

1275
01:42:01.182 --> 01:42:05.787 line:82%
Darling, will you please tell
these people how we know each other?

1276
01:42:07.627 --> 01:42:09.999 line:82%
Didn't I tell you he'd come running?

1277
01:42:10.083 --> 01:42:13.074 line:82%
Now do you guys believe me?
Do you trust me now?

1278
01:42:13.177 --> 01:42:14.712 line:82%
Oh, I missed you so much.

1279
01:42:14.796 --> 01:42:16.382 line:82%
Ria, what are you doing here?

1280
01:42:16.466 --> 01:42:18.216 line:82%
I thought I'd surprise you.

1281
01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:21.150 line:82%
Didn't I tell you he'd be happy to see me?

1282
01:42:22.857 --> 01:42:26.224 line:82%
This is Ria, and, Ria, this is...

1283
01:42:26.307 --> 01:42:31.661 line:82%
H.P., V.P., Lucky, A.J., and that's Raj.

1284
01:42:32.272 --> 01:42:37.595 line:82%
We've been introduced.
Everyone here knows me.

1285
01:42:38.241 --> 01:42:44.655 line:82%
Darling, you're too much.
You haven't told them about us.

1286
01:42:45.451 --> 01:42:47.382 line:82%
-Us?
-Boyfriend, girlfriend, eh?

1287
01:42:48.872 --> 01:42:50.650 line:82%
-What?
-Yeah?

1288
01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:54.127 line:82%
You've been together for the eight months.

1289
01:42:54.992 --> 01:42:56.963 line:82%
So, she's the little sister you mentioned?

1290
01:42:57.046 --> 01:43:01.893 line:82%
-And she has no one but you?
-And you have no one but her?

1291
01:43:01.976 --> 01:43:03.136 line:82%
No...

1292
01:43:03.219 --> 01:43:07.989 line:82%
-You came here for Anju's wedding.
-And left your heart in Bombay?

1293
01:43:08.082 --> 01:43:13.855 line:82%
-With his real girlfriend.
-So he calls every day to tell her...

1294
01:43:14.564 --> 01:43:18.032 line:82%
"I miss you, darling."

1295
01:43:18.132 --> 01:43:19.485 line:82%
"Darling"?

1296
01:43:20.273 --> 01:43:24.908 line:82%
I see. So, dear nephew,
is this your love story?

1297
01:43:24.991 --> 01:43:26.531 line:82%
Nice to meet you.

1298
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:30.955 line:82%
Try your best to cover it up but we know.

1299
01:43:31.039 --> 01:43:33.533 line:82%
Everyone else knows more than me.

1300
01:43:33.636 --> 01:43:34.709 line:82%
Darling!

1301
01:43:35.705 --> 01:43:38.880 line:82%
Why are you shying away? She's a beauty.

1302
01:43:38.963 --> 01:43:42.747 line:82%
-Given a chance...
-What?

1303
01:43:42.842 --> 01:43:45.378 line:82%
Smart, good-looking and se... oh!

1304
01:43:46.971 --> 01:43:50.291 line:82%
-Shall we, H.P.?
-Bye.

1305
01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:56.682 line:82%
The journey must have been tiring.
You should rest.

1306
01:43:57.725 --> 01:44:01.819 line:82%
-May we excuse ourselves?
-As soon as Anju arrives,

1307
01:44:01.903 --> 01:44:04.347 line:82%
-I'll have her come see you.
-No, no.

1308
01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.784 line:82%
-She'll be so happy to meet Ria.
-Sure, she will.

1309
01:44:07.867 --> 01:44:09.727 line:82%
-Come.
-Okay, dear.

1310
01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:16.349 line:82%
-I'm here, everything will be fine.
-What are you doing here?

1311
01:44:18.976 --> 01:44:23.633 line:82%
Raj, would you take my luggage in, please?

1312
01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.846 line:82%
Yes, darling... I mean to say, yes, Ria!

1313
01:44:32.196 --> 01:44:34.394 line:82%
Shall we, darling?

1314
01:44:34.477 --> 01:44:37.557 line:82%
Darling, my foot! What rubbish.

1315
01:44:38.690 --> 01:44:40.167 line:82%
Go on, laugh it up.

1316
01:44:41.841 --> 01:44:44.656 line:82%
Shut up, will you? Stupid.

1317
01:44:45.837 --> 01:44:48.908 line:82%
You've ruined my game.
Everything was so perfect.

1318
01:44:49.909 --> 01:44:52.285 line:82%
The wedding is only five days away
and you've come and...

1319
01:44:53.424 --> 01:44:54.799 line:82%
Why did you have to do this, Ria?

1320
01:44:55.493 --> 01:44:58.670 line:82%
To help you, stupid.
I'm here for your own good.

1321
01:44:58.762 --> 01:45:01.467 line:82%
Sure. Of course. I know what you're up to.

1322
01:45:02.178 --> 01:45:04.153 line:82%
-Do you realize what you've done?
-What?

1323
01:45:04.245 --> 01:45:08.334 line:82%
My bachelor party cost Rohit far less
than what your stupidity has cost me.

1324
01:45:09.929 --> 01:45:12.932 line:82%
-Darling, indeed.
-Are you done?

1325
01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.705 line:82%
Now, shut up and listen.

1326
01:45:15.798 --> 01:45:17.270 line:82%
You're in love with Anjali, right?

1327
01:45:17.353 --> 01:45:19.849 line:82%
What rubbish!
I'm in love with you, darling!

1328
01:45:19.932 --> 01:45:20.975 line:82%
-Sanjay.
-Darling.

1329
01:45:21.059 --> 01:45:22.165 line:82%
Sanjay, I'm serious!

1330
01:45:25.153 --> 01:45:27.285 line:82%
When did you realize
you were in love with Anjali?

1331
01:45:29.118 --> 01:45:30.158 line:82%
I will tell you.

1332
01:45:30.812 --> 01:45:36.080 line:82%
You realized when you saw
someone else walking into Anjali's life.

1333
01:45:37.248 --> 01:45:41.916 line:82%
When you saw someone else
getting close to Anjali,

1334
01:45:42.628 --> 01:45:47.084 line:82%
you realized how close you were,
and she's just like you.

1335
01:45:47.783 --> 01:45:48.821 line:82%
What do you mean?

1336
01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:53.646 line:82%
Anjali has never seen you
with another girl until now.

1337
01:45:54.273 --> 01:45:55.339 line:82%
So?

1338
01:45:55.423 --> 01:45:59.103 line:82%
When Anjali sees me with you,
Anjali could realize too.

1339
01:45:59.187 --> 01:46:02.822 line:82%
She might reciprocate what you felt
when you got news of her wedding.

1340
01:46:02.899 --> 01:46:05.474 line:82%
Understand, darling?

1341
01:46:05.568 --> 01:46:09.697 line:82%
Oh... darling.

1342
01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:16.412 line:82%
Anjali, this is Ria.
Ria, this is Anjali.

1343
01:46:16.496 --> 01:46:18.229 line:82%
-Hi, Anjali.
-Hi.

1344
01:46:19.082 --> 01:46:23.978 line:82%
Sanju, can I see you for a moment?
I have to tell you something.

1345
01:46:24.087 --> 01:46:27.743 line:82%
Sure. I mean, I'll be right there.

1346
01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:33.828 line:82%
Okay. By the way, her luggage is in
the kids' room. I hope you don't mind.

1347
01:46:33.935 --> 01:46:35.703 line:82%
I don't. I hope they don't.

1348
01:46:35.798 --> 01:46:37.141 line:82%
No, no, you're welcome.

1349
01:46:37.642 --> 01:46:39.981 line:82%
-Sanju, make it fast.
-Yeah.

1350
01:46:41.354 --> 01:46:44.258 line:82%
Ria, I think it's already working.

1351
01:46:44.899 --> 01:46:46.067 line:82%
I told you.

1352
01:46:46.604 --> 01:46:48.498 line:82%
Kapoor? Who's Kapoor?

1353
01:46:49.011 --> 01:46:53.533 line:82%
Mr. Kapoor in Mumbai.
Runs a big advertising agency.

1354
01:46:53.616 --> 01:46:56.317 line:82%
Last year, at one of his parties,
I met Ria.

1355
01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:57.990 line:82%
And you never told me?

1356
01:46:58.079 --> 01:46:59.542 line:82%
Did you tell me about Rohit?

1357
01:47:00.056 --> 01:47:01.566 line:82%
I told you about my wedding.

1358
01:47:01.941 --> 01:47:04.407 line:82%
I'm not marrying her yet.
I'll let you know when it happens.

1359
01:47:05.111 --> 01:47:07.880 line:82%
Are you going to marry Ria?

1360
01:47:08.005 --> 01:47:12.490 line:82%
Why, what's wrong with her?
She's smart, she's sexy, beautiful.

1361
01:47:12.593 --> 01:47:15.512 line:82%
-So? She's not the right girl for you.
-Why not?

1362
01:47:16.275 --> 01:47:19.725 line:82%
What do you mean, why not?
You're not gonna marry her.

1363
01:47:19.809 --> 01:47:23.354 line:82%
-I've said my piece. Now do what you want.
-Okay.

1364
01:47:23.437 --> 01:47:25.912 line:82%
And by the way, what's she doing here?

1365
01:47:26.515 --> 01:47:28.234 line:82%
She's here for your wedding.

1366
01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:32.168 line:82%
But that's my point.
What is she doing at my wedding?

1367
01:47:32.752 --> 01:47:35.747 line:82%
You're my friend, you invited me.
She's my friend, so--

1368
01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:40.371 line:82%
-Why did you invite her?
-Can't I bring a guest?

1369
01:47:40.454 --> 01:47:42.785 line:82%
Girlfriend, if I invite Ria,
is there a problem?

1370
01:47:42.889 --> 01:47:45.412 line:82%
No, she's fine. She's a sweet girl.

1371
01:47:46.435 --> 01:47:48.629 line:82%
Sweet, my foot. I don't like her.

1372
01:47:48.754 --> 01:47:52.231 line:82%
-You don't even know her.
-I don't want to know her.

1373
01:47:52.335 --> 01:47:54.302 line:82%
Worse, she's an eyesore.

1374
01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:56.846 line:82%
I can always accommodate her in my roo...

1375
01:47:56.929 --> 01:47:58.694 line:82%
No way. Are you nuts?

1376
01:47:59.352 --> 01:48:02.268 line:82%
I'm nuts, but you are jealous.

1377
01:48:02.351 --> 01:48:05.463 line:82%
Jealous? Why should I be jealous?

1378
01:48:05.556 --> 01:48:11.235 line:82%
Because besides you,
she's the only other friend I have.

1379
01:48:11.319 --> 01:48:15.213 line:82%
Don't you ever compare me to her.

1380
01:48:18.117 --> 01:48:20.967 line:82%
It's working, Ria. It's working.

1381
01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:24.540 line:82%
Are you the full moon?

1382
01:48:24.624 --> 01:48:28.054 line:82%
Are you a star?

1383
01:48:28.447 --> 01:48:30.323 line:82%
Whatever you may be

1384
01:48:30.407 --> 01:48:35.968 line:82%
By God, you're incomparable

1385
01:48:36.427 --> 01:48:40.262 line:82%
Are you a moon?

1386
01:48:40.366 --> 01:48:43.601 line:82%
That's my Fair and Lovely commercial.

1387
01:48:43.684 --> 01:48:46.058 line:82%
-Ding-dong.
-Wonderful.

1388
01:48:46.142 --> 01:48:49.023 line:82%
-Modeling must be fun.
-Show us a catwalk.

1389
01:48:49.106 --> 01:48:51.609 line:82%
-Ramp shows. I'll show you.
-I'll shoot it.

1390
01:48:55.446 --> 01:48:58.783 line:82%
Nice trick, but it won't help.

1391
01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:02.536 line:82%
We'll see.

1392
01:49:03.746 --> 01:49:05.032 line:82%
Okay.

1393
01:49:07.190 --> 01:49:10.836 line:82%
H.P., you still haven't given me
the pendant.

1394
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.404 line:82%
Who could refuse you? Here you are.

1395
01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:17.275 line:82%
Wow.

1396
01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:20.680 line:82%
Isn't it cool, V.P?

1397
01:49:21.569 --> 01:49:25.918 line:82%
Papa, Uncle, it looks like
you've forgotten

1398
01:49:26.001 --> 01:49:29.188 line:82%
all about the wedding,
which is just three days away.

1399
01:49:29.272 --> 01:49:32.193 line:82%
-What are we supposed to do?
-Are you asking me?

1400
01:49:32.998 --> 01:49:34.568 line:82%
Didn't Mr. Verma call you?

1401
01:49:35.194 --> 01:49:37.909 line:82%
Papa, the jeweler is on the phone.

1402
01:49:38.698 --> 01:49:40.972 line:82%
Am I supposed to organize my own wedding?

1403
01:49:41.065 --> 01:49:44.662 line:82%
No, that's my job.
Excuse me, we have work to do.

1404
01:49:47.873 --> 01:49:49.984 line:82%
Come on.

1405
01:49:51.961 --> 01:49:53.279 line:82%
Bye.

1406
01:49:56.048 --> 01:49:57.183 line:82%
Hi.

1407
01:49:57.717 --> 01:50:00.766 line:82%
Uncle, don't you have anything to do?

1408
01:50:00.861 --> 01:50:05.933 line:82%
Yes, you know, so much to do
for the wedding. Excuse me.

1409
01:50:06.017 --> 01:50:10.257 line:82%
Lucky, are you always organizing weddings?

1410
01:50:10.373 --> 01:50:15.109 line:82%
-Yes.
-And you still haven't found your girl?

1411
01:50:16.242 --> 01:50:18.374 line:82%
Not yet, but I'm sure I'll find someone.

1412
01:50:18.458 --> 01:50:22.783 line:82%
Maybe one of your cousins?
Someone who's not married yet?

1413
01:50:23.409 --> 01:50:25.036 line:82%
I don't have any sisters

1414
01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:31.522 line:82%
but they say I've come of age.

1415
01:50:31.619 --> 01:50:35.793 line:82%
-I'm sure they're right.
-Uncle, there's work to be done.

1416
01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.322 line:82%
Where? Yes, sorry.

1417
01:50:45.806 --> 01:50:49.303 line:82%
-May I help you?
-No, thanks, son.

1418
01:50:49.396 --> 01:50:52.730 line:82%
Come on, you've been working hard.
Come on.

1419
01:50:54.565 --> 01:50:59.468 line:82%
What with the arrival of the new star,
everyone's after her.

1420
01:51:00.529 --> 01:51:04.233 line:82%
-Sanjay is very lucky, isn't he?
-How come?

1421
01:51:04.326 --> 01:51:08.060 line:82%
Finding someone like Ria.

1422
01:51:08.153 --> 01:51:09.639 line:82%
Actually I find it strange.

1423
01:51:10.322 --> 01:51:13.732 line:82%
I never imagined Sanju
would like someone so...

1424
01:51:13.836 --> 01:51:14.960 line:82%
Modern.

1425
01:51:17.046 --> 01:51:22.640 line:82%
He lives in Bombay,
how could Sanjay like anyone else?

1426
01:51:23.452 --> 01:51:27.223 line:82%
You're cosmopolitan too. From America.

1427
01:51:27.306 --> 01:51:28.408 line:82%
I'm different.

1428
01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:32.682 line:82%
I always wanted someone simple.
Like Anjali.

1429
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:37.699 line:82%
But Sanjay and Ria make sense.

1430
01:51:42.588 --> 01:51:46.117 line:82%
-They look great together, don't they?
-Yes, great.

1431
01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:51.624 line:82%
They should get married
the same day as us.

1432
01:51:51.677 --> 01:51:57.461 line:82%
He's right. Besides, we're the only
relatives Sanju has.

1433
01:51:57.545 --> 01:52:00.714 line:82%
-Exactly, so why put it off?
-Yes.

1434
01:52:01.799 --> 01:52:04.171 line:82%
You have to teach me
how to make cheese omelets.

1435
01:52:04.275 --> 01:52:07.171 line:82%
Sanju picks fights in the kitchen.

1436
01:52:07.888 --> 01:52:11.879 line:82%
-Your kitchen? Or his?
-It's the same kitchen.

1437
01:52:11.972 --> 01:52:15.438 line:82%
In Bombay, you're lucky
to find one kitchen in a flat.

1438
01:52:16.105 --> 01:52:19.500 line:82%
I don't understand. You and Sanju...

1439
01:52:21.861 --> 01:52:26.585 line:82%
Sanju never told you?
We live together, in the same apartment.

1440
01:52:26.669 --> 01:52:27.867 line:82%
What?

1441
01:52:30.908 --> 01:52:31.912 line:82%
How many bedrooms?

1442
01:52:33.307 --> 01:52:37.001 line:82%
You and Ria live together
in the same flat?

1443
01:52:37.084 --> 01:52:40.267 line:82%
No, how could she live in my flat?
Never, no.

1444
01:52:40.894 --> 01:52:45.801 line:82%
-Why are you laughing?
-Nothing, Ria was just telling me

1445
01:52:46.594 --> 01:52:51.182 line:82%
about how Sanjay broke down
a bathroom door to rescue her.

1446
01:52:51.955 --> 01:52:54.116 line:82%
and she was clad only in a towel.

1447
01:52:54.199 --> 01:52:55.978 line:82%
You said she didn't live with you.

1448
01:52:56.061 --> 01:53:00.944 line:82%
She didn't, but just lately
she needed a place, so...

1449
01:53:01.567 --> 01:53:02.775 line:82%
Poor girl.

1450
01:53:04.111 --> 01:53:08.401 line:82%
How magnanimous of you, Sanjay,
to have given her shelter.

1451
01:53:09.144 --> 01:53:11.952 line:82%
Soon you'll be a happy family.
All the best.

1452
01:53:12.036 --> 01:53:13.387 line:82%
Anjali, Anjali.

1453
01:53:16.922 --> 01:53:22.379 line:82%
It was a good plan.
Girl, jealousy, it always works.

1454
01:53:23.714 --> 01:53:26.986 line:82%
Maybe the living together thing
was a bit much?

1455
01:53:28.469 --> 01:53:30.528 line:82%
They'll make sure you're married.

1456
01:53:32.676 --> 01:53:35.851 line:82%
Women like Anjali are best
for doctors like me.

1457
01:53:37.019 --> 01:53:38.607 line:82%
You need a Ria.

1458
01:53:40.039 --> 01:53:41.315 line:82%
Best of luck.

1459
01:53:43.118 --> 01:53:44.360 line:82%
Coming, Aunt.

1460
01:53:45.694 --> 01:53:48.942 line:82%
We're finalizing a wedding date
for you and Ria.

1461
01:53:50.032 --> 01:53:51.268 line:82%
Finalizing.

1462
01:53:52.785 --> 01:53:53.993 line:82%
Okay?

1463
01:53:54.705 --> 01:53:55.955 line:82%
You can shove your okay.

1464
01:53:57.957 --> 01:54:01.794 line:82%
It's not working.
I have to think of something else.

1465
01:54:05.506 --> 01:54:08.027 line:82%
Sanju, come out.

1466
01:54:08.734 --> 01:54:09.870 line:82%
I don't like this.

1467
01:54:09.969 --> 01:54:12.388 line:82%
Tell your Ria to come out.

1468
01:54:12.471 --> 01:54:15.349 line:82%
Poor Bunty has been knocking
for the past half hour.

1469
01:54:15.432 --> 01:54:17.977 line:82%
She's taking her sweet time
getting dressed...

1470
01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:19.695 line:82%
Where are you going all dressed up?

1471
01:54:19.768 --> 01:54:21.939 line:82%
Anju, the college reunion.

1472
01:54:22.856 --> 01:54:27.014 line:82%
The annual get together?
Didn't you get the invitation?

1473
01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:30.656 line:82%
I was invited before you.

1474
01:54:31.255 --> 01:54:33.742 line:82%
I've been invited
for the last three years.

1475
01:54:34.201 --> 01:54:36.220 line:82%
-I've never gone.
-So sad.

1476
01:54:36.727 --> 01:54:38.122 line:82%
No, really, Anju. So sad.

1477
01:54:38.205 --> 01:54:39.949 line:82%
-You'll miss it this year too.
-How come?

1478
01:54:40.778 --> 01:54:44.405 line:82%
How can you go?
You're getting married in three days.

1479
01:54:44.488 --> 01:54:45.921 line:82%
How can you go?

1480
01:54:46.005 --> 01:54:49.440 line:82%
I skipped the last three years
because you weren't here.

1481
01:54:49.533 --> 01:54:52.510 line:82%
Anju, we promised each other...

1482
01:54:52.601 --> 01:54:54.848 line:82%
-Promise?
-that we wouldn't go without each other.

1483
01:54:56.056 --> 01:54:58.404 line:82%
I forgot, sorry.

1484
01:54:59.077 --> 01:55:02.328 line:82%
No problem. Change.
We'll go downstairs for a game of carrom.

1485
01:55:03.112 --> 01:55:04.982 line:82%
-I can't.
-Why not?

1486
01:55:05.065 --> 01:55:08.647 line:82%
Darling, I'm ready. Let's go.

1487
01:55:12.539 --> 01:55:16.493 line:82%
I promised Ria.
She wants to see my school.

1488
01:55:16.577 --> 01:55:18.701 line:82%
I can't disappoint her.

1489
01:55:18.787 --> 01:55:20.019 line:82%
Shall we, darling?

1490
01:55:20.102 --> 01:55:21.425 line:82%
I'm dying to go to this party.

1491
01:55:23.794 --> 01:55:26.587 line:82%
You should come too.
I'm sure Ria won't mind.

1492
01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:28.007 line:82%
Thank you.

1493
01:55:28.090 --> 01:55:32.926 line:82%
My invitation says
I can bring a guest of my choice.

1494
01:55:33.010 --> 01:55:38.231 line:82%
-Then, you're coming?
-Of course. With a guy of my choice.

1495
01:55:40.462 --> 01:55:41.539 line:82%
Yes!

1496
01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:48.317 line:82%
Hey, all you beautiful people!
Welcome to the night of the year!

1497
01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:51.198 line:82%
The Welhams Reunion 2002.

1498
01:56:12.054 --> 01:56:15.427 line:82%
Hey, guys and girls, the judges are here
and the competition's on.

1499
01:56:15.511 --> 01:56:19.281 line:82%

Wow. What a pair.
That's what a friendship should be.

1523
02:00:59.670 --> 02:01:01.572 line:82%
I wish I had a friendship like that.

1524
02:01:02.339 --> 02:01:05.730 line:82%
-Are you talking about Sanjay or Anjali?
-I'm talking about you.

1525
02:01:07.719 --> 02:01:10.467 line:82%
Sanjay is lucky to have you.

1526
02:01:10.555 --> 02:01:12.511 line:82%
That's what everyone says in Bombay.

1527
02:01:12.596 --> 02:01:16.103 line:82%
Only lucky guys get friends...
I mean girlfriends like Ria.

1528
02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:22.442 line:82%
-Hey, what is it?
-Ria, spare me the act, will you?

1529
02:01:22.943 --> 02:01:25.761 line:82%
-Act? What act?
-I know.

1530
02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:29.366 line:82%
You're his friend, not girlfriend.

1531
02:01:30.367 --> 02:01:36.036 line:82%
But you make a great friend.
That's why I wish I had a friend like you.

1532
02:01:37.642 --> 02:01:40.544 line:82%
Someone who would be willing
to help me get Anjali.

1533
02:01:42.115 --> 02:01:44.631 line:82%
"You do what it takes
for friendship's sake."

1534
02:01:44.715 --> 02:01:47.426 line:82%
-Is that from "Maine Pyaar Kiya"?
-You've watched it?

1535
02:01:47.509 --> 02:01:49.993 line:82%
-Six times.
-I could be your friend.

1536
02:01:50.077 --> 02:01:51.847 line:82%
Off the record, huh?

1537
02:01:52.459 --> 02:01:54.516 line:82%
Can I ask you something off the record?

1538
02:01:55.724 --> 02:01:59.688 line:82%
What makes you so confident
that whatever you're doing is right?

1539
02:02:01.565 --> 02:02:02.858 line:82%
Look at them, Rohit.

1540
02:02:05.192 --> 02:02:09.197 line:82%
-Sanju, I want that trophy.
-I'm sorry. You got three of the five.

1541
02:02:09.281 --> 02:02:11.156 line:82%
-It's my tum.
-Sanju, please.

1542
02:02:11.239 --> 02:02:12.534 line:82%
No, fair is fair.

1543
02:02:13.744 --> 02:02:16.697 line:82%
Aren't they made for each other?

1544
02:02:18.214 --> 02:02:19.750 line:82%
Definitely not.

1545
02:02:21.943 --> 02:02:23.973 line:82%
Life's not a dance competition, Ria.

1546
02:02:25.277 --> 02:02:29.398 line:82%
Good dance partners
don't necessarily make good life partners.

1547
02:02:31.178 --> 02:02:35.565 line:82%
The bigger decisions in life
can't be based on trivia.

1548
02:02:37.851 --> 02:02:40.658 line:82%
Assume you didn't know Sanjay.

1549
02:02:42.322 --> 02:02:43.639 line:82%
Assume you were my friend.

1550
02:02:44.983 --> 02:02:46.656 line:82%
And I had invited you to the wedding.

1551
02:02:49.279 --> 02:02:50.375 line:82%
Now, look at them.

1552
02:02:55.285 --> 02:02:58.095 line:82%
-Anju, just a little...
-Okay, fine.

1553
02:02:59.296 --> 02:03:00.486 line:82%
Good.

1554
02:03:05.462 --> 02:03:07.249 line:82%
Do you still think that...

1555
02:03:09.466 --> 02:03:11.880 line:82%
Sanjay and Anjali were made
for each other?

1556
02:03:13.845 --> 02:03:16.256 line:82%
Whatever you or I think
makes no difference.

1557
02:03:17.599 --> 02:03:21.932 line:82%
The only thing that matters
is what Anjali wants.

1558
02:03:25.684 --> 02:03:26.760 line:82%
You're right.

1559
02:03:28.151 --> 02:03:29.539 line:82%
What Anjali wants.

1560
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:32.128 line:82%
-Okay?
-Bye.

1561
02:03:35.283 --> 02:03:36.695 line:82%
You're a nice guy, Rohit.

1562
02:03:40.163 --> 02:03:41.308 line:82%
I know.

1563
02:03:41.998 --> 02:03:46.123 line:82%
But sometimes I'm afraid my ethics
might create obstacles.

1564
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:53.575 line:82%
Hey, guys, what about a picture with me?
Hey, winners

1565
02:03:58.598 --> 02:03:59.800 line:82%
Gayatri.

1566
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:07.743 line:82%
Girls all over the world
are getting married,

1567
02:04:09.102 --> 02:04:11.710 line:82%
but no mother-of-the-bride
was ever as harried as you are.

1568
02:04:12.904 --> 02:04:14.251 line:82%
What will people say?

1569
02:04:15.644 --> 02:04:16.992 line:82%
-Hey, Ajit.
-Yes?

1570
02:04:17.075 --> 02:04:20.287 line:82%
-Send the sweets to the groom's house.
-Yes, uncle.

1571
02:04:23.415 --> 02:04:28.413 line:82%
Our son-in-law is one-in-a-million.
This is a time to rejoice, but you...

1572
02:04:29.171 --> 02:04:31.333 line:82%
Hi, girlfriend, what's going on?

1573
02:04:36.261 --> 02:04:38.455 line:82%
Sanju, will you make Gayatri see reason?

1574
02:04:39.472 --> 02:04:43.095 line:82%
She thinks that a twitch in her left eye
is a bad omen.

1575
02:04:44.186 --> 02:04:48.356 line:82%
Girlfriend, is aunt's superstition
rubbing off on you?

1576
02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:53.778 line:82%
If you ever have a daughter
when she gets married,

1577
02:04:54.487 --> 02:04:56.865 line:82%
-then you'll understand.
-What?

1578
02:04:59.409 --> 02:05:03.489 line:82%
Isn't it sad that my daughter will
be leaving me in a couple of days?

1579
02:05:04.789 --> 02:05:09.134 line:82%
I have a wonderful idea.
Let me marry Anju.

1580
02:05:09.586 --> 02:05:10.854 line:82%
I'll move in with you.

1581
02:05:11.508 --> 02:05:14.212 line:82%
Then Anjali won't have to go away.
And neither will I. Simple.

1582
02:05:14.716 --> 02:05:19.896 line:82%
If that was an option,
no one would be happier than me.

1583
02:05:19.971 --> 02:05:25.452 line:82%
You'd be happy to give your daughter away
to a fool like him?

1584
02:05:27.896 --> 02:05:31.920 line:82%
Your daughter chose someone nice
like Rohit. Thank God for that.

1585
02:05:32.634 --> 02:05:34.236 line:82%
Everything's working out fine.

1586
02:05:35.070 --> 02:05:38.882 line:82%
Most parents lose sleep
over their daughter's marriage.

1587
02:05:39.407 --> 02:05:44.085 line:82%
But before we knew it,
this match was finalized.

1588
02:05:46.623 --> 02:05:49.958 line:82%
-Before we knew it, just think.
-What's there to worry about?

1589
02:05:50.543 --> 02:05:54.798 line:82%
Such a big occasion, so many people...

1590
02:05:56.828 --> 02:06:01.554 line:82%
it takes only one wrong word
to hurt everyone.

1591
02:06:02.347 --> 02:06:06.101 line:82%
It's happened so many times.
I've been a witness to times

1592
02:06:06.977 --> 02:06:11.147 line:82%
where one misplaced word

1593
02:06:11.856 --> 02:06:14.401 line:82%
can destroy relationships
that have lasted years.

1594
02:06:16.236 --> 02:06:18.568 line:82%
Are we about to forge new relationships

1595
02:06:21.111 --> 02:06:23.618 line:82%
at the cost of old ones?

1596
02:06:25.453 --> 02:06:26.922 line:82%
It deserves a thought.

1597
02:06:34.754 --> 02:06:36.016 line:82%
Girlfriend...

1598
02:06:37.173 --> 02:06:38.966 line:82%
you're worried unnecessarily.

1599
02:06:40.677 --> 02:06:41.930 line:82%
I'm here,

1600
02:06:43.388 --> 02:06:44.889 line:82%
and I promise you,

1601
02:06:46.016 --> 02:06:49.803 line:82%
no one will be hurt, no one will be sad.

1602
02:06:50.312 --> 02:06:51.667 line:82%
I'll make sure everyone is happy.

1603

Oh God, Gayatri, you know what he's like.

1607
02:07:30.769 --> 02:07:33.202 line:82%
He was joking. He wasn't serious.

1608
02:07:34.656 --> 02:07:35.884 line:82%
What if he was?

1609
02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:39.584 line:82%
-Uncle!
-Yes.

1610
02:07:40.445 --> 02:07:41.955 line:82%

We're friends. Just friends.

Then what was all this?

1665
02:13:05.728 --> 02:13:09.789 line:82%
Life plays such jokes on us,

1666
02:13:10.224 --> 02:13:11.818 line:82%
and we play jokes on each other.

1667
02:13:13.194 --> 02:13:15.059 line:82%

Why not?

1670
02:13:26.708 --> 02:13:31.306 line:82%
Because the girl in his heart
isn't in Bombay.

1671
02:13:33.297 --> 02:13:35.425 line:82%
Aunty Ria, your taxi is here.

1672
02:13:41.848 --> 02:13:45.390 line:82%
Not in Bombay? Where, then?

1673
02:13:46.936 --> 02:13:48.380 line:82%
How should I know?

1674
02:13:49.313 --> 02:13:54.897 line:82%
You're his best friend.
You should know what's in his heart.

1675
02:13:57.071 --> 02:14:00.994 line:82%
Seek within your heart,
you might find the answer.

1676
02:14:26.976 --> 02:14:29.589 line:82%
Yes, Sanjay, what is it?

1677
02:14:32.064 --> 02:14:35.011 line:82%
I'm going... back.

1678
02:14:38.102 --> 02:14:39.320 line:82%

1679
02:14:40.531 --> 02:14:41.726 line:82%

I don't know why I thought Anjali and I...

1681
02:14:49.141 --> 02:14:50.625 line:82%
I didn't think about

1682
02:14:50.708 --> 02:14:53.273 line:82%
how one mistake of mine
might break so many hearts.

1683
02:14:55.671 --> 02:14:58.605 line:82%
Thanks to you, I stopped myself
from making that mistake.

1684
02:15:00.802 --> 02:15:06.062 line:82%
Someone else in your place...
but how could it be anyone but you?

1685
02:15:07.725 --> 02:15:11.684 line:82%
You're Rohit, the perfect one.

1686
02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:14.690 line:82%
The one for Anjali.

1687
02:15:18.402 --> 02:15:20.058 line:82%
I was Anjali's friend.

1688
02:15:22.136 --> 02:15:23.449 line:82%
I'll stay her friend.

1689
02:15:25.284 --> 02:15:26.856 line:82%
But I won't be able to stay.

1690
02:15:28.746 --> 02:15:33.591 line:82%
I don't have the courage to see Anjali
with someone else.

1691
02:15:36.379 --> 02:15:39.507 line:82%
Nor am I gentleman enough
to just let you take her away.

1692
02:15:43.594 --> 02:15:44.848 line:82%
Take care of Anjali, Rohit.

1693
02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:47.807 line:82%
Just...

1694
02:15:49.313 --> 02:15:50.478 line:82%
take care of her.

1695
02:15:54.021 --> 02:15:55.351 line:82%
Sanju.

1696
02:15:57.358 --> 02:16:01.522 line:82%
The wedding is tomorrow.
I won't ask you to stay for the wedding.

1697
02:16:04.282 --> 02:16:08.368 line:82%
But won't you join in
my celebrations today?

1698
02:16:11.414 --> 02:16:14.911 line:82%
We just became friends, didn't we?

1699
02:16:17.461 --> 02:16:20.771 line:82%
Yes, we just became friends.

1700
02:16:25.052 --> 02:16:28.456 line:82%
And I'll make sure
everyone joins the celebration.

1701
02:16:29.849 --> 02:16:32.974 line:82%

02:23:18.173 --> 02:23:22.193 line:82%
You're the one who told me
to put my heart into the game.

1757
02:23:23.762 --> 02:23:25.427 line:82%
Win or lose, what's the difference?

1758
02:23:27.474 --> 02:23:28.886 line:82%
Sanju, are you sure?

1759
02:23:30.728 --> 02:23:32.370 line:82%
Are you doing the right thing?

1760
02:23:34.251 --> 02:23:35.696 line:82%
Yes, uncle.

1761
02:23:39.653 --> 02:23:41.005 line:82%
As sure as you were.

1762
02:24:01.967 --> 02:24:04.096 line:82%
Indian women are incomprehensible.

1763
02:24:04.970 --> 02:24:09.697 line:82%
Try to get close, and their decorum
and decency stands in the way.

1764
02:24:10.434 --> 02:24:15.040 line:82%
Then, 12 hours before the wedding,

1765
02:24:16.106 --> 02:24:17.821 line:82%
I'm summoned.

1766
02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:20.114 line:82%
Well, here I am.

1767
02:24:22.821 --> 02:24:24.965 line:82%
Why the sudden show of affection?

1768
02:24:28.369 --> 02:24:34.124 line:82%
Rohit...
we've told each other everything...

1769
02:24:37.002 --> 02:24:38.173 line:82%
except for one thing.

1770
02:24:40.381 --> 02:24:43.929 line:82%
Something maybe you forgot to ask,
and I forgot to tell you.

1771
02:24:45.464 --> 02:24:46.470 line:82%
What?

1772
02:24:46.887 --> 02:24:49.862 line:82%
Whether I've ever been in love before you.

1773
02:24:52.559 --> 02:24:55.399 line:82%
-Were you?
-Yes.

1774
02:24:59.395 --> 02:25:03.362 line:82%
From the moment such thoughts

1775
02:25:03.445 --> 02:25:07.308 line:82%
about a boy arise in a girl's mind...

1776
02:25:10.619 --> 02:25:12.912 line:82%
there has been such a boy in my life.

1777
02:25:14.064 --> 02:25:15.165 line:82%
Who?

1778
02:25:15.707 --> 02:25:20.292 line:82%
Sanju, my friend, my best friend.

1779
02:25:24.716 --> 02:25:30.641 line:82%
But you saw Sanju.
How can I expect him to understand?

1780
02:25:31.557 --> 02:25:33.225 line:82%
He's lost in his own world.

1781
02:25:35.731 --> 02:25:40.774 line:82%
I always hoped that at some point
Sanju would tell me how he felt...

1782
02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:49.554 line:82%
but as time went by,
I realized I was wrong.

1783
02:25:50.909 --> 02:25:56.096 line:82%
To Sanju, I'm a friend, just a friend.

1784
02:25:57.534 --> 02:26:02.921 line:82%
So I suppressed my feelings,
so he wouldn't find out.

1785
02:26:04.127 --> 02:26:07.885 line:82%
Then, you came into my life.

1786
02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:12.076 line:82%
You made me believe

1787
02:26:13.265 --> 02:26:16.810 line:82%
I could have a happy life
with someone else too.

1788
02:26:18.395 --> 02:26:24.479 line:82%
But before we start this life,
I wanted you to know.

1789
02:26:26.612 --> 02:26:30.449 line:82%
Our relationship is based on honesty.

1790
02:26:32.583 --> 02:26:33.869 line:82%
Right, Rohit?

1791
02:26:37.456 --> 02:26:41.065 line:82%
That's why I asked to see you.

1792
02:27:21.808 --> 02:27:23.085 line:82%
Beautiful.

1793
02:27:23.832 --> 02:27:25.379 line:82%
Hello, Rohit.

1794
02:27:28.293 --> 02:27:32.219 line:82%
The flowers are beautiful,
just like your daughter.

1795
02:27:35.055 --> 02:27:38.900 line:82%
-You haven't gone to bed yet?
-Couldn't sleep.

1796
02:27:41.019 --> 02:27:42.610 line:82%
How come you're up so late?

1797
02:27:44.753 --> 02:27:46.108 line:82%
I promised Anju

1798
02:27:47.317 --> 02:27:49.584 line:82%
that I'd decorate her wedding hall myself.

1799
02:27:50.359 --> 02:27:52.030 line:82%
I'm decorating it in flowers.

1800
02:27:52.114 --> 02:27:56.820 line:82%
May it be flowers,
flowers for her all the way and no thorns.

1801
02:28:01.164 --> 02:28:03.178 line:82%
Your prayer is already bearing fruit.

1802
02:28:07.838 --> 02:28:10.327 line:82%
If I ask you a question,

1803
02:28:12.272 --> 02:28:14.001 line:82%
will you give me an honest answer?

1804
02:28:14.094 --> 02:28:15.560 line:82%
Yes, ask me.

1805
02:28:16.388 --> 02:28:21.965 line:82%
I wasn't your first choice
for Anjali, was I?

1806
02:28:26.773 --> 02:28:29.524 line:82%
No, son, it's not like that.

1807
02:28:29.610 --> 02:28:31.160 line:82%
I know.

1808
02:28:32.237 --> 02:28:34.454 line:82%
I know and it's okay.

1809
02:28:36.325 --> 02:28:39.112 line:82%
But there's something you don't know.

1810
02:28:41.997 --> 02:28:43.899 line:82%
I wasn't Anjali's first choice either.

1811
02:28:45.834 --> 02:28:47.412 line:82%
What are you saying, son?

1812
02:28:49.015 --> 02:28:54.343 line:82%
You and your daughter
had the same first choice.

1813
02:28:57.638 --> 02:28:58.977 line:82%
Sanjay.

1814
02:29:03.727 --> 02:29:06.014 line:82%
In all these years,

1815
02:29:06.098 --> 02:29:10.776 line:82%
In all these years, Anjali could never
tell Sanju how dearly she loves him?

1816
02:29:13.522 --> 02:29:16.740 line:82%
And then Sanjay,
he loves Anjali so fiercely,

1817
02:29:16.823 --> 02:29:19.519 line:82%
he can't bear to see
her marry someone else.

1818
02:29:21.563 --> 02:29:26.833 line:82%
And I'm the only person in the world

1819
02:29:30.712 --> 02:29:32.786 line:82%
who knows about their feelings.

1820
02:29:34.813 --> 02:29:38.929 line:82%
The only one who can
change this story.

1821
02:29:41.723 --> 02:29:42.990 line:82%
What should I do?

1822
02:29:44.351 --> 02:29:45.352 line:82%
I...

1823
02:29:49.424 --> 02:29:50.649 line:82%
What do I do now?

1824
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:57.781 line:82%
Now that I know Sanjay was right.

1825
02:30:00.325 --> 02:30:03.564 line:82%
This is his and Anjali's story.

1826
02:30:06.456 --> 02:30:10.549 line:82%
I had no place in this story.

1827
02:30:14.881 --> 02:30:20.178 line:82%
Sanjay left
because he didn't want to hurt anyone.

1828
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:24.586 line:82%
At least he knew
what the right thing to do was.

1829
02:30:27.646 --> 02:30:29.146 line:82%
Anjali told me...

1830
02:30:30.397 --> 02:30:35.010 line:82%
because she wanted honesty to be
the cornerstone of our relationship.

1831
02:30:37.112 --> 02:30:39.120 line:82%
She knew the right to do, too.

1832
02:30:43.118 --> 02:30:47.566 line:82%
Now it's my turn.
I know what I have to do.

1833
02:30:50.350 --> 02:30:54.588 line:82%
But I can't do it alone.

1834
02:30:57.466 --> 02:31:02.304 line:82%
I need a mother to bless my way,
to tell me,

1835
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:09.269 line:82%
"Yes, son, you're doing the right thing.

1836
02:31:12.603 --> 02:31:13.899 line:82%
I'm with you."

1837
02:31:16.526 --> 02:31:19.890 line:82%
Are you with me?

1838
02:31:19.988 --> 02:31:22.290 line:82%
Yes.

1839
02:31:39.174 --> 02:31:42.511 line:82%
Hey, you know how I feel?

1840
02:31:44.826 --> 02:31:46.109 line:82%
How?

1841
02:31:46.223 --> 02:31:49.796 line:82%
Like I've fast-forwarded
a decade into life.

1842
02:31:50.977 --> 02:31:54.811 line:82%
I feel like we're both 35 and here we are,
sitting at the Gateway of India.

1843
02:31:55.819 --> 02:31:58.610 line:82%
You haven't found a boy
and I haven't found a girl.

1844
02:32:00.403 --> 02:32:01.693 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes.

1845
02:32:02.364 --> 02:32:05.162 line:82%
-So?
-So let's make a deal.

1846
02:32:06.326 --> 02:32:10.956 line:82%
At 35, if we're still here,
we'll get married to each other.

1847
02:32:14.543 --> 02:32:17.053 line:82%
-On one condition.
-What?

1848
02:32:17.671 --> 02:32:19.604 line:82%
You'll still do the cooking.

1849
02:32:21.967 --> 02:32:24.132 line:82%
Okay, done.

1850
02:32:31.101 --> 02:32:33.688 line:82%
Talking about being 35,

1851
02:32:34.771 --> 02:32:36.383 line:82%
I don't even know...

1852
02:32:37.816 --> 02:32:41.252 line:82%
with Anjali gone,
how I'll manage to live through tomorrow.

1853
02:32:59.035 --> 02:33:03.341 line:82%
Anju, what are you doing here?
Tomorrow's your wedding.

1854
02:33:03.425 --> 02:33:05.121 line:82%
Why did you leave?

1855
02:33:06.511 --> 02:33:09.728 line:82%
-Ria got sick all of a sudden.
-No Ria, no Rohit.

1856
02:33:11.683 --> 02:33:17.606 line:82%
Nobody is part of this question, Sanju.
You and I...

1857
02:33:19.504 --> 02:33:21.151 line:82%
this question between us.

1858
02:33:22.235 --> 02:33:27.048 line:82%
-Why did you leave?
-Because...

1859
02:33:28.408 --> 02:33:30.478 line:82%
-Because I...
-Because what?

1860
02:33:33.747 --> 02:33:36.963 line:82%
Because I can't bear to see you
marry someone else.

1861
02:33:38.627 --> 02:33:44.097 line:82%
-Why not?
-Because I wanted to marry you.

1862
02:33:45.175 --> 02:33:49.547 line:82%
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I was afraid, Anju.

1863
02:33:51.166 --> 02:33:52.307 line:82%
If you refused...

1864
02:33:55.140 --> 02:33:56.603 line:82%
it would've broken my heart.

1865
02:33:57.729 --> 02:34:01.316 line:82%
What about all these years
that I've been pining for you, Sanju?

1866
02:34:04.778 --> 02:34:09.442 line:82%
Did you ever think about the girl
who was with you all her life,

1867
02:34:10.325 --> 02:34:13.003 line:82%
holding hands,
sitting with you on that swing?

1868
02:34:14.537 --> 02:34:19.641 line:82%
In the whole world,
why does she have only one friend?

1869
02:34:23.004 --> 02:34:27.050 line:82%
Never thought about the girl
who spent her childhood

1870
02:34:28.385 --> 02:34:33.666 line:82%
and her adolescence with one boy.

1871
02:34:35.291 --> 02:34:39.270 line:82%
Why would she want anyone else's company
for the rest of her life?

1872
02:34:42.033 --> 02:34:43.274 line:82%
Have you never wondered?

1873
02:34:44.526 --> 02:34:48.578 line:82%
You never thought that all I needed
was my friend?

1874
02:34:49.531 --> 02:34:52.165 line:82%
The only one.

1875
02:34:54.544 --> 02:34:55.551 line:82%
You.

1876
02:34:59.332 --> 02:35:02.836 line:82%
How can a girl be expected

1877
02:35:04.921 --> 02:35:07.966 line:82%
to express her feelings first?

1878
02:35:11.922 --> 02:35:14.889 line:82%
You never wondered? Never?

1879
02:35:14.973 --> 02:35:17.635 line:82%
I'm sorry, Anju.

1880
02:35:17.726 --> 02:35:21.236 line:82%
Sorry? Is that all you can say?

1881
02:35:22.522 --> 02:35:26.186 line:82%
Won't you say what I've wanted to hear
all these years?

1882
02:35:27.902 --> 02:35:29.961 line:82%
I...

1883
02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:31.966 line:82%
I what?

1884
02:35:32.657 --> 02:35:33.987 line:82%
I love you.

1885
02:35:36.327 --> 02:35:38.293 line:82%
I love you too, stupid.
