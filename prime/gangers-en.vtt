00:02:02.237 --> 00:02:05.153 line:82%
Our leader is here!
Make way, make way!

2
00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:07.903 line:82%
Greetings, sir!

3
00:02:07.987 --> 00:02:09.445 line:82%
-Greetings, sir.
-Welcome, sir.

4
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:10.695 line:82%
Welcome, sir.

5
00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:11.820 line:82%
What, Malaiarasan?

6
00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:14.278 line:82%
You've really gone all out
with the decorations!

7
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.612 line:82%
-Everything is for you, sir.
-Sir, bless me!

8
00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:16.778 line:82%
Hey! Get up.

9
00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:19.918 line:82%
Study well and make
your father proud.

10
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.328 line:82%
Feels like yesterday

11
00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:25.703 line:82%
but it's already three years
since your brother passed.

12
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:26.911 line:82%
Sir.

13
00:02:27.078 --> 00:02:28.411 line:82%
-Are you doing well?
-Yes, sir.

14
00:02:28.453 --> 00:02:30.036 line:82%
-Thayamma!
-Yes, madam?

15
00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:32.244 line:82%
Sis, hold on a minute.

16
00:02:33.578 --> 00:02:35.203 line:82%
It’s late for school, isn’t it?
Go now.

17
00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:37.328 line:82%
No, Mom. There’s a lot of
work today, right?

18
00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:38.578 line:82%
I’ll take leave today?

19
00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.411 line:82%
I can manage everything.
You go!

20
00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:41.536 line:82%
Okay, Mom.

21
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.869 line:82%
Rid us of troubles, end all strife,
Shine bright, oh Tamil land!

22
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:48.286 line:82%
Long live the Tamil language!

23
00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:50.994 line:82%
Last time, you won the speech competition.

24
00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:52.119 line:82%
But not this time!

25
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:54.078 line:82%
This watch is the bet.
Challenge?

26
00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.446 line:82%
-What? Ready for it?
-Next up, we have Geetha from 11-D.

27
00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:01.786 line:82%
I strongly oppose the title itself!

28
00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:03.828 line:82%
Why didn’t you challenge her?

29
00:03:04.244 --> 00:03:05.911 line:82%
Teacher… that’s because…

30
00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:12.369 line:82%
Speak with courage.

31
00:03:12.411 --> 00:03:13.911 line:82%
Teacher... No...

32
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.078 line:82%
-Keep quiet.
-This is true freedom for women.

33
00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:18.328 line:82%
That’s when women will triumph!

34
00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.494 line:82%
-Next up, we have Ramya from 11-B.
-But why, teacher?

35
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:23.744 line:82%
Because you will win!

36
00:03:25.453 --> 00:03:28.536 line:82%
Greetings to all.
Long live Bharathi’s legacy!

37
00:03:28.703 --> 00:03:32.161 line:82%
Freedom is not about enslaving another.

38
00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:34.411 line:82%
Woman is the fundamental force
behind everything.

39
00:03:34.494 --> 00:03:36.744 line:82%
This force does not perish,
it protects us.

40
00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:38.661 line:82%
It nurtures us like the divine itself.

41
00:03:38.703 --> 00:03:40.869 line:82%
Men and women stand as equals.

42
00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:42.286 line:82%
Long live Bharathi!

43
00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:48.911 line:82%
The winner of the speech
competition is Ramya!

44
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:51.869 line:82%
Congrats!

45
00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:53.578 line:82%
-Congrats, Ramya.
-Thanks, sir.

46
00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:56.036 line:82%
-Teacher, your watch?
-Hold on to it as a reminder of me.

47
00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:57.744 line:82%
It’s my gift to you.

48
00:03:58.578 --> 00:03:59.578 line:82%
Thanks a lot.

49
00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:07.411 line:82%
Has Ramya been here?

50
00:04:07.578 --> 00:04:08.578 line:82%
No, why?

51
00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.328 line:82%
She left for school this morning,
but she hasn’t come back yet.

52
00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:12.369 line:82%
What are you saying?

53
00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:14.869 line:82%
I searched everywhere.

54
00:04:15.244 --> 00:04:17.494 line:82%
She never goes anywhere
without telling me.

55
00:04:17.578 --> 00:04:19.203 line:82%
Don’t worry.
Let’s go find her.

56
00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:26.369 line:82%
To the Director General of Police,

57
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:29.661 line:82%
I, Sujitha, a teacher at Arasankottai
Higher Secondary School, am writing to you.

58
00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:33.828 line:82%
Last week, our student Ramya
suddenly went missing.

59
00:04:34.078 --> 00:04:38.578 line:82%
Despite filing a complaint,
the police have taken no action.

60
00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:40.369 line:82%
This is not an isolated incident.

61
00:04:40.453 --> 00:04:44.786 line:82%
Such occurrences have been increasing
in our town over the past few years.

62
00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:47.786 line:82%
However, the local police continue
to turn a blind eye to these crimes.

63
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:53.161 line:82%
The reason behind this are the brothers,
Malaiarasan and Kottaiarasan.

64
00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:56.328 line:82%
Malaiarasan, using his positions
as Union Chairman,

65
00:04:56.494 --> 00:05:00.036 line:82%
Head of the Co-operative Society,
and School Correspondent,

66
00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:05.953 line:82%
and Kottaiarasan, illegally producing
spirit under a mineral water company,

67
00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:08.619 line:82%
are involved in countless
criminal activities.

68
00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:11.536 line:82%
We’re supplying both
water and booze to this whole town.

69
00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.328 line:82%
Be careful, our boys might
mix up the cans.

70
00:05:13.578 --> 00:05:16.411 line:82%
That’s why the spirit cans
are marked with an ‘X’.

71
00:05:16.494 --> 00:05:20.369 line:82%
They use our school grounds asa base for their unlawful operations.

72
00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:25.078 line:82%
We urge you to intervene immediately
and ensure justice in Ramya’s case.

73
00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:28.036 line:82%
If no action is taken,
teachers from our district

74
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.078 line:82%
will be left with no choice but
to stage a protest in the capital. Thanks.

75
00:05:31.203 --> 00:05:34.244 line:82%
Listen, we’ve been receiving a lot of
complaints from Arasankottai.

76
00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:36.953 line:82%
I want you to go there, investigate,
and report back to me.

77
00:05:37.078 --> 00:05:38.786 line:82%
No one should know you’re a cop.

78
00:05:38.994 --> 00:05:40.744 line:82%
I’ve arranged a teaching job for you there.

79
00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:41.786 line:82%
Here.

80
00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:08.453 line:82%
Arasankottai tickets! Get down!

81
00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:10.161 line:82%
Please, wait a minute.

82
00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:11.286 line:82%
Teacher!

83
00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:21.619 line:82%
You can go!

84
00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:23.786 line:82%
It’s time for school.

85
00:06:23.828 --> 00:06:25.703 line:82%
Let’s put up the rest of the
posters tomorrow. Come on.

86
00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:28.078 line:82%
Madam!

87
00:06:28.578 --> 00:06:29.953 line:82%
-Yes?
-One minute.

88
00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:32.369 line:82%
Where is Arasan Higher Secondary School?

89
00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:33.453 line:82%
And you are?

90
00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:35.786 line:82%
I’ve joined as
the new P.T. teacher there.

91
00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:36.828 line:82%
Oh!

92
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:37.953 line:82%
Come, I’ll drop you.

93
00:06:38.078 --> 00:06:39.536 line:82%
No, it’s okay.
I can take an auto.

94
00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:40.744 line:82%
But there’s no auto here.

95
00:06:40.953 --> 00:06:42.244 line:82%
There’s an auto strike today, sir.

96
00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.161 line:82%
I work as the C.S. teacher there.

97
00:06:44.828 --> 00:06:46.078 line:82%
We’re colleagues now.

98
00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.328 line:82%
But... I don’t know how to ride doubles.

99
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:51.661 line:82%
That's okay.

100
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:02.619 line:82%
What’s going on?
Why are there so many lorries?

101
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:04.119 line:82%
Is there any construction going on?

102
00:07:04.203 --> 00:07:05.203 line:82%
Nothing like that.

103
00:07:05.244 --> 00:07:07.453 line:82%
You’ll find out soon enough.

104
00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:12.369 line:82%
You’re new here.
So, there’s a lot you don’t know yet.

105
00:07:14.078 --> 00:07:15.661 line:82%
Welcome to our school, Saravanan.

106
00:07:15.786 --> 00:07:17.244 line:82%
You got in here on merit.

107
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:20.203 line:82%
There’s already a P.T. teacher here
under the management quota.

108
00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:21.703 line:82%
Sports Day is in three months.

109
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:24.786 line:82%
The one who performs better will
secure the permanent position.

110
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:25.911 line:82%
Okay, sir.

111
00:07:26.328 --> 00:07:28.786 line:82%
Because of you guys, I didn’t finish
my record and now I’m getting punished!

112
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:30.244 line:82%
This is so humiliating!

113
00:07:30.328 --> 00:07:31.619 line:82%
Come, the ground is this way.

114
00:07:31.786 --> 00:07:33.244 line:82%
- Oh, my!
- Sir, careful.

115
00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:34.286 line:82%
Sir!

116
00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:36.494 line:82%
-Sir! Oh, God!
-Are you alright?

117
00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:37.994 line:82%
Sir, are you okay?

118
00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:39.994 line:82%
You!

119
00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:42.286 line:82%
Is this how
you behave with a teacher?

120
00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:43.994 line:82%
Don’t you have any respect?

121
00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:47.578 line:82%
Teacher, whatever it is, just say it.
Don’t raise your hand.

122
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:48.744 line:82%
What are you doing?
Let go of her hand!

123
00:07:48.786 --> 00:07:50.244 line:82%
She’s a teacher.
Apologize!

124
00:07:50.786 --> 00:07:51.786 line:82%
Come on, apologize!

125
00:07:51.828 --> 00:07:52.828 line:82%
Sorry!

126
00:07:53.203 --> 00:07:54.203 line:82%
Sorry, teacher.

127
00:07:54.244 --> 00:07:56.328 line:82%
First off,
stop hanging out with them,

128
00:07:56.411 --> 00:07:58.286 line:82%
or you’ll ruin your reputation!

129
00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:00.494 line:82%
-Careful. Are you hurt?
-I'm okay, sir.

130
00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:02.369 line:82%
He’s also a newly joined Maths teacher.

131
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:03.411 line:82%
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

132
00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:04.578 line:82%
You see, sir?

133
00:08:05.203 --> 00:08:08.161 line:82%
We’ve reached a point where students
are ragging newly appointed teachers.

134
00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:09.828 line:82%
The school has really gone downhill, sir.

135
00:08:10.786 --> 00:08:12.453 line:82%
Velu, pass it to me!

136
00:08:24.828 --> 00:08:27.661 line:82%
Oh god! Is this a ball or a rock?

137
00:08:27.744 --> 00:08:29.536 line:82%
Why the hell did you burst my ball?!

138
00:08:32.703 --> 00:08:35.619 line:82%
Sir, Singaram sir is always
causing trouble!

139
00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:37.703 line:82%
-What happened now?
-He burst my ball!

140
00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:38.869 line:82%
Singaram, what is this?

141
00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:41.328 line:82%
There's no point talking to you!
As usual, I'll fine you.

142
00:08:41.453 --> 00:08:43.453 line:82%
2,000 for breaking the spear into two.

143
00:08:43.536 --> 00:08:45.411 line:82%
600 for the bat.

144
00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:47.328 line:82%
200 for the stump.

145
00:08:47.453 --> 00:08:49.744 line:82%
And now, 800 for smashing
this ball to bits.

146
00:08:49.828 --> 00:08:51.661 line:82%
Sir! Why are you charging
full price for an old ball?!

147
00:08:51.744 --> 00:08:53.703 line:82%
That’s how I do it.
The total is 3600.

148
00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:54.828 line:82%
I’ll deduct it from your salary
this month.

149
00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:55.661 line:82%
Sir! Sir! Sir!

150
00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:57.494 line:82%
He owes me 100.
Add that too!

151
00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:59.703 line:82%
Hey, if you keep talking,
I’ll have to fight you!

152
00:08:59.828 --> 00:09:02.119 line:82%
Fight? Fine, let’s go for it!

153
00:09:02.203 --> 00:09:04.619 line:82%
Come on, let’s fight!

154
00:09:06.619 --> 00:09:07.619 line:82%
Stop it, you two!

155
00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:08.703 line:82%
Is this a school or what?!

156
00:09:08.786 --> 00:09:11.203 line:82%
Tell that to him!
Just look at his face!

157
00:09:11.244 --> 00:09:12.286 line:82%
Hey, watch your mouth!

158
00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:14.453 line:82%
Get lost!
I’ve dealt with plenty like you.

159
00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:16.869 line:82%
Oh yeah?
I’ve seen worse than you.

160
00:09:16.953 --> 00:09:19.244 line:82%
Come to my area,
I’ll handle you there!

161
00:09:19.494 --> 00:09:21.703 line:82%
Sir, you’re the reason I’m being insulted!

162
00:09:21.786 --> 00:09:23.036 line:82%
Forget it, Singaram.

163
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:24.786 line:82%
This is Saravanan. In two months-

164
00:09:24.869 --> 00:09:26.953 line:82%
I know, sir. In the end,
you’ll pick one of us.

165
00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:28.161 line:82%
Why wait two months for that?

166
00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:30.203 line:82%
I’ll give him a penalty kick.

167
00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:32.203 line:82%
If he can score
a goal against my defense,

168
00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:35.078 line:82%
I’ll give up my posting as a prize.
Okay?

169
00:09:35.203 --> 00:09:36.203 line:82%
Done!

170
00:09:41.703 --> 00:09:43.453 line:82%
I'm ready. Come on!

171
00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:53.661 line:82%
Oh, God!

172
00:09:54.244 --> 00:09:55.661 line:82%
-Sir, be careful.
-Singaram!

173
00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:57.453 line:82%
You can’t even block a ball?

174
00:09:57.494 --> 00:09:58.869 line:82%
No, this is a foul!

175
00:09:58.953 --> 00:10:00.119 line:82%
You’re supposed to kick
the ball into the goal,

176
00:10:00.203 --> 00:10:02.119 line:82%
not kick a person into it
and play with him!

177
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:03.161 line:82%
Sorry, master.

178
00:10:03.161 --> 00:10:04.869 line:82%
Why don’t you take the shot?
I’ll be the goalkeeper.

179
00:10:04.953 --> 00:10:06.244 line:82%
No, that won’t work.

180
00:10:06.453 --> 00:10:07.786 line:82%
Suji ma’am, look!

181
00:10:10.869 --> 00:10:13.244 line:82%
Suji! My dear is here.

182
00:10:15.203 --> 00:10:17.078 line:82%
This is a challenge for Singaram!

183
00:10:17.453 --> 00:10:20.411 line:82%
I’m not just a P.T master anymore,
I’m your competitor too!

184
00:10:21.161 --> 00:10:23.619 line:82%
With this goal, I’m gonna sweep
my girl off her feet.

185
00:10:23.786 --> 00:10:26.119 line:82%
Watch me!
Move!

186
00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:31.661 line:82%
-God, I can’t even bend.
-Singaram sir is taking the shot!

187
00:10:31.994 --> 00:10:33.536 line:82%
Oh my god!

188
00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:39.494 line:82%
Wonder who's going to
get hurt today.

189
00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:42.369 line:82%
What's happening?

190
00:10:42.786 --> 00:10:46.578 line:82%
I haven’t even kicked the ball yet,
and they’re already running?

191
00:10:46.744 --> 00:10:47.744 line:82%
Hello!

192
00:10:47.869 --> 00:10:49.619 line:82%
The ball’s gonna come at jet speed.

193
00:10:49.703 --> 00:10:50.619 line:82%
Be careful.

194
00:10:50.703 --> 00:10:51.661 line:82%
Just kick it.

195
00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:55.578 line:82%
I’ll turn my love for you...

196
00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:58.619 line:82%
...into the most powerful kick!

197
00:11:05.036 --> 00:11:07.078 line:82%
Where’s the ball going?

198
00:11:07.494 --> 00:11:08.744 line:82%
Damn, it's coming back!

199
00:11:09.244 --> 00:11:10.494 line:82%
- Oh, no!
-
He’s dead!

200
00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:12.161 line:82%
Oh god!

201
00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:16.244 line:82%
Singaram, you can’t kick or keep!

202
00:11:16.286 --> 00:11:18.369 line:82%
Stop it, sir! He came in between,

203
00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.328 line:82%
otherwise, that would’ve been
a perfect goal.

204
00:11:20.369 --> 00:11:21.786 line:82%
If you have doubts,
let’s go one more round!

205
00:11:21.828 --> 00:11:23.744 line:82%
-Why? To kill us all?
-Alright, take him away.

206
00:11:23.869 --> 00:11:25.536 line:82%
-Yes, doctor. We're on the way.
-Come on, hurry up!

207
00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:26.994 line:82%
Hey!

208
00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.411 line:82%
You’ve just arrived.

209
00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:29.994 line:82%
Don't try to do
everything in one day.

210
00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:31.411 line:82%
That’s my property.
Stay here.

211
00:11:31.536 --> 00:11:32.536 line:82%
Let's go!

212
00:11:35.203 --> 00:11:37.911 line:82%
Be careful. There are steps.

213
00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:40.994 line:82%
Thanks to the Maths teacher,
I now have a chance to woo Suji.

214
00:11:41.286 --> 00:11:42.286 line:82%
Go straight.

215
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:45.161 line:82%
Careful! Careful, Suji…

216
00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:48.744 line:82%
Huh? Why is she taking a U-turn?

217
00:11:54.536 --> 00:11:55.786 line:82%
Suji! Suji!

218
00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:57.494 line:82%
Why are you tearing down
the Chairman’s posters?!

219
00:11:57.536 --> 00:11:58.786 line:82%
-They’re bad people.
-Look, sir!

220
00:11:58.869 --> 00:12:00.786 line:82%
They’ve pasted their posters
over Ramya’s notice.

221
00:12:00.828 --> 00:12:01.869 line:82%
-Damn, it feels good.
-Is this fair, sir?

222
00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:03.328 line:82%
No, it’s not.

223
00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:04.786 line:82%
It’s injustice!
Atrocity!

224
00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:07.078 line:82%
Watch me,
I’ll tear everything down.

225
00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:08.328 line:82%
I won’t let this slide!

226
00:12:08.453 --> 00:12:09.828 line:82%
Amal, look there.

227
00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:12.994 line:82%
-No poster stays after my Suji’s word!
-Hey! Stop it.

228
00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:13.869 line:82%
I’ll tear it all down!

229
00:12:13.994 --> 00:12:15.703 line:82%
Why are you tearing down
our boss’s poster?

230
00:12:15.744 --> 00:12:17.411 line:82%
Because I want to!
Who are you to question me?

231
00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:18.994 line:82%
-You dare?!
-Yes!

232
00:12:19.036 --> 00:12:20.744 line:82%
-What did you just say?
-I don’t repeat myself.

233
00:12:22.578 --> 00:12:24.828 line:82%
-Hey! I told him to do it.
-What? You told him to?!

234
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.661 line:82%
Oh god, with just some bones
and a little blood,

235
00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:29.203 line:82%
she’s picking a fight with
these wild animals?

236
00:12:29.244 --> 00:12:30.286 line:82%
Why did you do that?

237
00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:33.494 line:82%
This is a hospital!
People come and go.

238
00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:35.994 line:82%
If I stick Ramya’s notice here,
more people will see it.

239
00:12:36.411 --> 00:12:39.078 line:82%
It’ll help us find her faster!

240
00:12:39.244 --> 00:12:41.869 line:82%
And you pasted
your boss’s poster over it!

241
00:12:42.078 --> 00:12:43.911 line:82%
Hey! We’ll paste it wherever we want!

242
00:12:43.953 --> 00:12:46.369 line:82%
He’s not just the school chairman,
he owns this whole town!

243
00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:49.786 line:82%
Yeah, that’s what happens when
an accused criminal becomes a chairman!

244
00:12:49.953 --> 00:12:50.953 line:82%
Damn!

245
00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:54.244 line:82%
The atrocities you commit in
this town won’t last forever.

246
00:12:54.328 --> 00:12:55.328 line:82%
Oh, god!

247
00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:57.703 line:82%
I'm working to put an end to this!

248
00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:59.078 line:82%
If you keep up this nonsense!

249
00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:00.661 line:82%
Damn, I’ve got to save my girl!

250
00:13:00.744 --> 00:13:03.786 line:82%
Hey! Hold on, hold on.

251
00:13:04.328 --> 00:13:06.828 line:82%
Why are you arguing with a woman when
a handsome man like me is right here?

252
00:13:10.703 --> 00:13:12.494 line:82%
Thanks for grabbing him!

253
00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:14.119 line:82%
"Thanks for grabbing him"?

254
00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:16.869 line:82%
Damn, they’re about to turn me
into a poster now.

255
00:13:17.494 --> 00:13:18.578 line:82%
Calm down, calm down.

256
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:20.828 line:82%
It’s a blessing to get beaten
by a pretty woman!

257
00:13:21.828 --> 00:13:23.161 line:82%
Oh god, his eyes are blood red!

258
00:13:23.203 --> 00:13:25.286 line:82%
-Hey! What? Are you two a team?
-No, sir!

259
00:13:25.328 --> 00:13:27.911 line:82%
-If my boss hears about this—
-What will he do?

260
00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:29.703 line:82%
Call him! I’ll slap him with
my slipper too!

261
00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:32.036 line:82%
-What?!
-You’ll hit my boss?!

262
00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:33.078 line:82%
I’ll kill both of you!

263
00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:35.161 line:82%
-You think I’m scared?
-Suji! Suji!

264
00:13:35.203 --> 00:13:36.036 line:82%
Drop the knife!

265
00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:38.161 line:82%
You’ve already put someone
in the hospital bed with that.

266
00:13:38.203 --> 00:13:39.619 line:82%
Can’t you lay low?!

267
00:13:40.494 --> 00:13:42.869 line:82%
They’ve already put someone
in the hospital?!

268
00:13:43.244 --> 00:13:44.244 line:82%
Oh god!

269
00:13:44.286 --> 00:13:47.828 line:82%
What is this? Why did you hit
him with a slipper?

270
00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.036 line:82%
I felt brave
because you were here, sir.

271
00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:51.453 line:82%
Because of me?

272
00:13:51.619 --> 00:13:54.661 line:82%
-I never knew you were so bold, sir!
-Me?!

273
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:57.494 line:82%
Super, Singaram master!

274
00:13:59.661 --> 00:14:00.911 line:82%
Super, Singaram!

275
00:14:01.953 --> 00:14:04.911 line:82%
Wow… Just her touch is enough
for my salvation.

276
00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:06.036 line:82%
Hey!

277
00:14:07.536 --> 00:14:09.703 line:82%
Singaram, you’re done.

278
00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:14.453 line:82%
You’ve got the prayers, the poojas,
and the festival ready!

279
00:14:14.994 --> 00:14:17.786 line:82%
Now, you be ready for eveything, okay?

280
00:14:19.369 --> 00:14:23.536 line:82%
Om Shakthi! Para Sakthi!

281
00:14:23.994 --> 00:14:24.994 line:82%
Is everything okay?

282
00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:26.286 line:82%
Everything is fine, sir.

283
00:14:26.453 --> 00:14:28.328 line:82%
-Honey, it’s time.
-Soori, I’ll call you later.

284
00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:32.328 line:82%
[prayer chants continue]

285
00:14:35.994 --> 00:14:37.119 line:82%
No, put it on my brother’s son.

286
00:14:37.161 --> 00:14:38.494 line:82%
-Why?
-Just take it, son.

287
00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:39.703 line:82%
It's a sign of respect.

288
00:14:47.411 --> 00:14:49.119 line:82%
It’s okay. We’ll handle it tomorrow.

289
00:14:53.744 --> 00:14:54.744 line:82%
Have some.

290
00:14:56.078 --> 00:14:58.661 line:82%
-It’s fine, teacher.
-It’s okay, just take it.

291
00:15:00.078 --> 00:15:02.828 line:82%
It’s been over two weeks since
Ramya went missing.

292
00:15:02.994 --> 00:15:04.369 line:82%
Don’t tell anyone,

293
00:15:04.578 --> 00:15:06.619 line:82%
but we got word from
the commissioner’s office that

294
00:15:06.703 --> 00:15:09.328 line:82%
a special officer has been
secretly assigned.

295
00:15:09.494 --> 00:15:10.661 line:82%
She will be found.

296
00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:13.369 line:82%
She’s never been away from me
for even a day.

297
00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:18.328 line:82%
Now, I don’t know where she is
or how she is.

298
00:15:20.036 --> 00:15:22.703 line:82%
People are saying all sorts
of things in town.

299
00:15:25.244 --> 00:15:26.953 line:82%
Please fail my daughter.

300
00:15:27.036 --> 00:15:28.411 line:82%
But Ramya is the class topper!

301
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.244 line:82%
After my husband passed away,

302
00:15:30.286 --> 00:15:32.453 line:82%
I’ve been doing household work
to make ends meet.

303
00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:36.619 line:82%
I’m not ashamed to say this,
I have no money for her education.

304
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:38.578 line:82%
I’ll pay her fees.

305
00:15:38.744 --> 00:15:40.994 line:82%
You may pay for this month,
but what about next month?

306
00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:42.286 line:82%
And the one after that?

307
00:15:42.578 --> 00:15:44.828 line:82%
We don’t want to burden you. Fail her.

308
00:15:51.578 --> 00:15:54.119 line:82%
If you really want to do something
for your mother, study well!

309
00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:58.119 line:82%
Only then can you take care of her
like a queen in the future.

310
00:15:59.453 --> 00:16:01.036 line:82%
I’ll arrange a scholarship for you.

311
00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:04.744 line:82%
Trust me, okay?
Now, smile.

312
00:16:06.119 --> 00:16:07.161 line:82%
-Grandpa!
-What is it, dear?

313
00:16:07.203 --> 00:16:08.828 line:82%
Ramya got a sponsor!

314
00:16:08.911 --> 00:16:11.869 line:82%
She doesn’t have to worry about
school fees anymore!

315
00:16:12.161 --> 00:16:13.661 line:82%
I have to tell her mother right away!

316
00:16:13.744 --> 00:16:14.744 line:82%
Teacher!

317
00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:16.661 line:82%
Has Ramya been here?

318
00:16:21.953 --> 00:16:22.953 line:82%
Cheers!

319
00:16:23.619 --> 00:16:24.828 line:82%
-Hey, Singaram!
-Useless.

320
00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:26.578 line:82%
Is this a bar or the teachers' quarters?

321
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:28.803 line:82%
-Shut up, you egghead.
-Hey!

322
00:16:28.828 --> 00:16:31.391 line:82%
Not you. You've got some hair.

323
00:16:32.369 --> 00:16:33.718 line:82%
Padma teacher!

324
00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:36.695 line:82%
-What?!
-Make us an omelet.

325
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.928 line:82%
How dare you guys drink and cause
trouble every day where teachers live?

326
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.911 line:82%
Wait, I'll complain to the H.M!

327
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:43.411 line:82%
The H.M.?

328
00:16:43.494 --> 00:16:46.119 line:82%
What will he do?
He’ll just fine us both. That's it.

329
00:16:48.994 --> 00:16:50.994 line:82%
Hey! Why is your granddaughter glaring?

330
00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:53.244 line:82%
The one who glares now will be
the one to caress later.

331
00:16:53.286 --> 00:16:55.328 line:82%
Listen, you’ve been spewing
nonsense like this

332
00:16:55.369 --> 00:16:57.161 line:82%
and guzzling down booze at my expense.

333
00:16:57.244 --> 00:16:58.911 line:82%
You’re of no use, Agasu!

334
00:16:58.953 --> 00:17:01.203 line:82%
Hey! Call me Agasalingam.

335
00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:02.411 line:82%
Is that so?

336
00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:05.578 line:82%
If you want me to say your full name,
then get your granddaughter married to me.

337
00:17:05.744 --> 00:17:07.661 line:82%
I’ll put your full name first
on the wedding card.

338
00:17:07.744 --> 00:17:10.786 line:82%
You've guzzled down booze worth 4,35,000!

339
00:17:10.953 --> 00:17:13.244 line:82%
Pay me back with interest!

340
00:17:13.536 --> 00:17:14.911 line:82%
That math sounds off.

341
00:17:14.994 --> 00:17:16.286 line:82%
We can correct it later.

342
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.036 line:82%
First, tell me how to marry her.

343
00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:20.536 line:82%
Talk first, then drink.

344
00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.078 line:82%
Hey! Are you sleeping?

345
00:17:28.244 --> 00:17:29.869 line:82%
No, I’m thinking.

346
00:17:29.953 --> 00:17:31.119 line:82%
Oh, carry on.

347
00:17:31.286 --> 00:17:33.828 line:82%
Back in my youth,
I wooed my wife with a song.

348
00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:35.844 line:82%
-I’ll teach you that.
-Alright.

349
00:17:35.869 --> 00:17:37.758 line:82%
Why don’t you try the same?

350
00:17:38.911 --> 00:17:42.036 line:82%
♪ At the peak of Courtallam,
A hibiscus swings ♪

351
00:17:42.244 --> 00:17:45.453 line:82%
♪ Your gaze shines like
Papaya’s gleam, my love! ♪

356
00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.286 line:82%
She's gazing!

357
00:18:05.744 --> 00:18:07.244 line:82%
-Oh, my!
-Get in!

358
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:11.411 line:82%
Damn!

359
00:18:11.536 --> 00:18:12.661 line:82%
Sir, it's you?

360
00:18:14.036 --> 00:18:15.786 line:82%
How did you know to save me?

361
00:18:15.911 --> 00:18:17.369 line:82%
My wife did the same.

362
00:18:17.494 --> 00:18:20.286 line:82%
At least he only got water,
she threw dung water on me!

363
00:18:20.536 --> 00:18:21.911 line:82%
Love always starts with a fight.

364
00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:23.578 line:82%
I'm so sorry.

365
00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:26.244 line:82%
It's okay. You didn’t know.

366
00:18:26.536 --> 00:18:27.744 line:82%
I told you, right?

367
00:18:27.953 --> 00:18:31.119 line:82%
Hey! That should’ve happened
to me, not him!

368
00:18:31.286 --> 00:18:33.953 line:82%
That could’ve been my moment,
and you ruined it, slick!

369
00:18:34.286 --> 00:18:37.328 line:82%
They said I can collect my house key
from you at the quarters.

370
00:18:37.869 --> 00:18:40.453 line:82%
You’ve given me quite the welcome.
Is this how you greet everyone?

371
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:41.661 line:82%
No, sir.

372
00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:43.828 line:82%
I was aiming for them,
but it landed on you by mistake.

373
00:18:44.453 --> 00:18:46.494 line:82%
-Come, I’ll get your key.
-Okay.

374
00:18:47.703 --> 00:18:50.244 line:82%
Hey! He could’ve dried himself
with a towel.

375
00:18:50.369 --> 00:18:51.953 line:82%
Why is she doing it for him?

376
00:18:52.036 --> 00:18:53.953 line:82%
Your granddaughter’s behavior is
getting out of hand!

377
00:18:54.036 --> 00:18:56.953 line:82%
Hey! You’re doubting my granddaughter?

378
00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:58.953 line:82%
That’s it! Consider this a divorce
between you two!

379
00:18:59.661 --> 00:19:00.661 line:82%
Divorce?!

380
00:19:01.494 --> 00:19:04.119 line:82%
When did we even get married?!

381
00:19:09.536 --> 00:19:10.619 line:82%
So, Saravanan sir!

382
00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:12.953 line:82%
All settled into your new home
in the school quarters?

383
00:19:12.994 --> 00:19:14.994 line:82%
-Yeah, it’s good.
-Just adjust however it is.

384
00:19:15.994 --> 00:19:18.161 line:82%
Anyway, you’re going to be
the permanent one.

385
00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.328 line:82%
Sir, this isn’t a regular cigarette.

386
00:19:25.244 --> 00:19:26.411 line:82%
How did this end up inside our school?

387
00:19:26.536 --> 00:19:28.869 line:82%
The eleventh graders just finished their
P.T. period and went back in.

388
00:19:34.911 --> 00:19:35.911 line:82%
Get up.

389
00:19:38.786 --> 00:19:40.536 line:82%
Sit down.
You, up!

390
00:19:55.286 --> 00:19:57.369 line:82%
Sir, there's nothing here.

391
00:20:05.161 --> 00:20:06.869 line:82%
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, ma'am.

392
00:20:09.494 --> 00:20:10.869 line:82%
-Show me who it was.
-Come, sir.

393
00:20:12.703 --> 00:20:14.911 line:82%
This one?
The guy who got the slipper shot?

394
00:20:15.036 --> 00:20:16.453 line:82%
He’s coming with the chairman?!

395
00:20:18.828 --> 00:20:21.119 line:82%
They dared to touch my poster?!

396
00:20:21.578 --> 00:20:23.244 line:82%
If they work in our school
and don’t fear us,

397
00:20:23.411 --> 00:20:24.953 line:82%
then what about our respect?

398
00:20:25.036 --> 00:20:26.703 line:82%
They’re searching with rage.

399
00:20:26.744 --> 00:20:27.869 line:82%
He’s the P.T. master, sir.

400
00:20:27.869 --> 00:20:30.078 line:82%
He won’t be in class,
he must be on the ground.

401
00:20:30.161 --> 00:20:31.828 line:82%
-Come on.
-Once I catch him, he’s done for.

402
00:20:31.911 --> 00:20:33.161 line:82%
Where do I hide?

403
00:20:35.286 --> 00:20:37.161 line:82%
Hey, go find that P.T. teacher!

404
00:20:37.244 --> 00:20:38.453 line:82%
-Okay, sir.
-Move fast!

405
00:20:38.661 --> 00:20:40.661 line:82%
She might’ve hit me,
but he was behind all this.

406
00:20:40.703 --> 00:20:41.828 line:82%
She had the guts because of him.

407
00:20:41.869 --> 00:20:43.536 line:82%
Idiot! You got slapped
and now you’re talking big?

408
00:20:43.578 --> 00:20:46.494 line:82%
Instead of running, they’ve made
me climb like a damn monkey.

409
00:20:46.661 --> 00:20:47.869 line:82%
I’ll show him now, sir!

410
00:20:47.994 --> 00:20:48.994 line:82%
What will they do?

411
00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:52.786 line:82%
This is too slippery,
I might land straight on them.

412
00:20:52.828 --> 00:20:54.161 line:82%
I let them go yesterday
because of the inspector.

413
00:20:54.203 --> 00:20:56.036 line:82%
But today, I’ll fry him up and eat him.

414
00:20:56.078 --> 00:20:59.369 line:82%
Oh god! They’re planning to
eat me for lunch?!

415
00:21:02.953 --> 00:21:06.661 line:82%
Maybe if I surrender,
they’ll plan their lunch else where.

416
00:21:08.036 --> 00:21:09.036 line:82%
Where are they?

417
00:21:09.744 --> 00:21:10.744 line:82%
Gone?

418
00:21:10.994 --> 00:21:11.994 line:82%
Oh, god.

419
00:21:12.411 --> 00:21:15.119 line:82%
They’ll sniff around and come
right back for me.

420
00:21:15.203 --> 00:21:17.119 line:82%
They won’t rest till they
get a taste of me.

421
00:21:18.994 --> 00:21:21.494 line:82%
You said you’d slap me with a
slipper if I showed up? Do it.

422
00:21:21.536 --> 00:21:23.244 line:82%
Sir, let it go.
She just misspoke.

423
00:21:23.286 --> 00:21:24.494 line:82%
Hey! Get lost.

424
00:21:24.828 --> 00:21:25.786 line:82%
Hit me.

425
00:21:25.828 --> 00:21:27.828 line:82%
-I will if I have to.
-What did you just say, you nag?

426
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.036 line:82%
Don’t you dare call me that!

427
00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:32.411 line:82%
What’s wrong in standing up
against injustice?

428
00:21:32.703 --> 00:21:33.911 line:82%
Another injustice is about to
happen right now.

429
00:21:34.078 --> 00:21:34.994 line:82%
Let’s see who stands up for that.

430
00:21:35.036 --> 00:21:35.703 line:82%
Sir!

431
00:21:35.786 --> 00:21:36.911 line:82%
- Let her go!
- Oh, god.

432
00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:38.869 line:82%
No one dares to go against me here.

433
00:21:38.994 --> 00:21:40.536 line:82%
Why are you all just standing there?!

434
00:21:40.994 --> 00:21:42.119 line:82%
Let go of me.

435
00:21:42.244 --> 00:21:43.494 line:82%
Uncle!

436
00:21:43.578 --> 00:21:44.661 line:82%
-Let go!
-What are you doing, uncle?!

437
00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:46.828 line:82%
Let her go!
Let go, uncle.

438
00:21:47.494 --> 00:21:49.244 line:82%
She’s a teacher!
Come on.

439
00:21:49.828 --> 00:21:50.911 line:82%
-Come on.
-Let go!

440
00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:52.994 line:82%
You got saved because of him.

441
00:21:53.161 --> 00:21:56.369 line:82%
Do it again, and I’ll strip you naked
in front of the whole town.

442
00:21:57.161 --> 00:21:58.786 line:82%
-Move!
-Move aside.

443
00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:00.703 line:82%
Move!

444
00:22:02.161 --> 00:22:03.828 line:82%
A teacher should just teach
and mind her own business.

445
00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:22.161 line:82%
Sir, sir.
Bar’s closing. Please leave.

446
00:22:27.411 --> 00:22:29.078 line:82%
Hey! Look at me!

447
00:22:29.203 --> 00:22:32.078 line:82%
Don’t even dream of marrying my girl!

448
00:22:32.244 --> 00:22:34.786 line:82%
I wasn’t there when it happened.

449
00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:35.744 line:82%
And if you were?

450
00:22:35.786 --> 00:22:37.911 line:82%
If I were, it would’ve been
like a Jackie Chan movie!

451
00:22:37.953 --> 00:22:39.203 line:82%
I’m burning with rage.

452
00:22:39.244 --> 00:22:42.161 line:82%
Look into my eyes.
See that fire?

453
00:22:42.536 --> 00:22:44.703 line:82%
I would’ve sliced them apart!

454
00:22:45.453 --> 00:22:47.203 line:82%
You can't with this.
This is a menu card.

455
00:22:47.953 --> 00:22:50.703 line:82%
I’m the kind of man who turns
a menu card into a weapon!

456
00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:56.703 line:82%
If I see Malaiarasan again,
I’ll make him the side dish for my booze.

457
00:22:56.994 --> 00:22:58.786 line:82%
Soori, all okay?

458
00:22:59.078 --> 00:23:00.411 line:82%
All good, sir.

459
00:23:00.994 --> 00:23:01.786 line:82%
Alright.

460
00:23:02.703 --> 00:23:04.703 line:82%
You really have a soft spot for Soori.

461
00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:07.536 line:82%
Even with all this work,
you call to check on him.

462
00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:08.953 line:82%
Here.

463
00:23:09.244 --> 00:23:10.036 line:82%
What else, sir?

464
00:23:10.078 --> 00:23:11.661 line:82%
The usual Crab Masala.

465
00:23:11.786 --> 00:23:14.411 line:82%
It’s over…
How about fish?

466
00:23:14.536 --> 00:23:17.286 line:82%
Ah, never mind!
I’ll get you what you want.

467
00:23:20.369 --> 00:23:21.369 line:82%
Singaram.

468
00:23:21.744 --> 00:23:22.578 line:82%
Huh?

469
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:24.328 line:82%
It’s Malaiarasan’s bad time.

470
00:23:24.494 --> 00:23:25.828 line:82%
How do you know?

471
00:23:25.953 --> 00:23:27.494 line:82%
He’s walked straight into your trap.

472
00:23:29.286 --> 00:23:30.286 line:82%
Where?

473
00:23:35.578 --> 00:23:36.828 line:82%
-Hello.
-Suji...

474
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:39.244 line:82%
-Malaiarasan is done for.
-Grandpa?

475
00:23:39.286 --> 00:23:40.369 line:82%
He’s about to get destroyed!

476
00:23:40.453 --> 00:23:41.578 line:82%
What are you doing?!

477
00:23:41.994 --> 00:23:43.161 line:82%
Grandpa, listen to me--

478
00:23:43.994 --> 00:23:45.869 line:82%
Agasu, why are you in such a hurry?!

479
00:23:45.911 --> 00:23:47.703 line:82%
These things need a plan!

480
00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:50.411 line:82%
Beat him up like you said.
Then my granddaughter is yours!

481
00:23:50.494 --> 00:23:51.994 line:82%
Hey, Malaiarasan!

482
00:23:52.744 --> 00:23:55.494 line:82%
-Agasu! Stop! Don’t go!
-Let me go!

483
00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:58.869 line:82%
Oh dear, he's sneaking a snake
into my briefs!

484
00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:00.411 line:82%
You rotten scoundrel!

485
00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:05.036 line:82%
We all know he’s a scoundrel.
Do you really need to spell it out?

486
00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:06.911 line:82%
-That’s the teacher’s grandfather, right?
-Yes, sir.

487
00:24:09.036 --> 00:24:10.869 line:82%
He’s coming this way. Kill him.

488
00:24:10.953 --> 00:24:13.328 line:82%
Bro, you’re gonna get us both killed!

489
00:24:13.453 --> 00:24:16.869 line:82%
At least I can beg for my life,
you can’t even bend with that potbelly.

490
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:18.411 line:82%
-Come, let’s run!
-Shut up.

491
00:24:18.494 --> 00:24:21.286 line:82%
God, I should punch myself
for calling myself Jackie Chan.

492
00:24:21.369 --> 00:24:23.411 line:82%
Come on, Malaiarasan!

493
00:24:23.494 --> 00:24:24.828 line:82%
Why is he covering his face?

494
00:24:24.869 --> 00:24:25.661 line:82%
-Hey!
-Sir?

495
00:24:25.744 --> 00:24:27.453 line:82%
-You’re still here?
-I’m leaving now, sir.

496
00:24:28.536 --> 00:24:30.994 line:82%
Old man, I pity you.
Run away while you still can.

497
00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:32.994 line:82%
I’m not alone.

498
00:24:33.161 --> 00:24:35.244 line:82%
I have Lord
Yama
who's going to
take your life.

499
00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:37.244 line:82%
Show your guts to him.

500
00:24:37.953 --> 00:24:39.994 line:82%
Oh god! Where is he?

501
00:24:44.161 --> 00:24:46.578 line:82%
Let's not let him go half-drunk.

502
00:24:46.828 --> 00:24:47.911 line:82%

538
00:27:55.744 --> 00:27:58.869 line:82%

he’s the real police in my eyes.

beating everyone up?

Malaiarasan is out cold.

544
00:28:31.578 --> 00:28:33.161 line:82%
Let's use this situation.

545
00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:36.078 line:82%
I'll take pictures, make it look like
I took down Malaiarasan,

546
00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:39.244 line:82%
and send them to Suji to build
a strong case for my love.

I'm wearing the usual coaching clothes
I wear on Wednesdays,

553

and they’re acting like it’s
the first time they’ve seen it!

-Sir! Super!
-You killed it, sir!

555

Singaram, master! Super!

557
00:29:22.078 --> 00:29:23.244 line:82%
It's Suji.

Hey, I’ll join you guys too!

Thanks a lot.

564

For what?

565
00:30:33.453 --> 00:30:35.953 line:82%
For beating them up black and blue
at the bar last night.

566
00:30:35.994 --> 00:30:37.869 line:82%
I beat them?
What are you talking about?

567
00:30:37.994 --> 00:30:40.453 line:82%
Stop acting.
I know everything.

568
00:30:40.578 --> 00:30:41.578 line:82%
Know what?

569
00:30:43.286 --> 00:30:44.578 line:82%
-That you're a cop.
-What?!

570
00:30:44.661 --> 00:30:49.286 line:82%
If you'd hit them at school,
they would have found out you're a cop.

571
00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:53.411 line:82%
So you covered your face and
hit them at the bar. Correct?

572
00:30:53.453 --> 00:30:55.494 line:82%
-No, you've got it all wrong--
-I know everything.

573
00:30:55.994 --> 00:30:57.119 line:82%
What does she know?

574
00:30:57.536 --> 00:30:59.036 line:82%
I brought you here.

575
00:30:59.911 --> 00:31:00.994 line:82%
Of course, I know.

576
00:31:17.453 --> 00:31:19.703 line:82%
The pictures are working!

577
00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:26.078 line:82%
-Saravana...
-What, Singaram?

578
00:31:26.161 --> 00:31:28.161 line:82%
I’ll tell you something,
but don’t be shocked.

579
00:31:28.244 --> 00:31:29.078 line:82%
What is it?

580
00:31:29.161 --> 00:31:31.494 line:82%
I’ve made Suji fall for me.

581
00:31:31.911 --> 00:31:32.911 line:82%
What?!

582
00:31:33.078 --> 00:31:34.203 line:82%
Don’t believe me?
Come on.

583
00:31:34.286 --> 00:31:37.161 line:82%
She saw the pictures of me
beating Malaiarasan.

584
00:31:37.203 --> 00:31:38.453 line:82%
That’s how she fell for me.

585
00:31:38.953 --> 00:31:41.036 line:82%
-Good morning.
-Good morning, miss.

586
00:31:45.869 --> 00:31:48.661 line:82%
Look, how she’s gazing at me.

587
00:31:48.953 --> 00:31:51.036 line:82%
See the romance in her eyes

588
00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:53.244 line:82%
Look well!

589
00:31:56.661 --> 00:31:58.286 line:82%
Nice smile.

590
00:32:04.036 --> 00:32:05.494 line:82%
Didn’t I tell you?

591
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:09.286 line:82%
I won’t tell anyone,
you shouldn’t either.

592
00:32:09.328 --> 00:32:10.203 line:82%
Okay.

593
00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:11.911 line:82%
-Singaram, sir!
-Who’s that?

594
00:32:11.994 --> 00:32:12.994 line:82%
Super!

595
00:32:13.078 --> 00:32:13.869 line:82%
Hey!

596
00:32:13.953 --> 00:32:16.328 line:82%
You saw the pictures?
Don’t tell anyone.

597
00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:19.369 line:82%
Why would I? Everyone’s already
telling me. Look!

598
00:32:19.661 --> 00:32:21.661 line:82%
A crab's hook, an elephant's stomp,
and a crocodile's bite.

599
00:32:21.744 --> 00:32:23.619 line:82%
-Damn!
-And it's not just this. Look over there!

600
00:32:23.953 --> 00:32:25.661 line:82%
Singaram, master. Super!

601
00:32:27.994 --> 00:32:29.494 line:82%
How did they get the pictures?

602
00:32:31.036 --> 00:32:33.286 line:82%
My dear lord, I've worked so hard
to take these pictures.

603
00:32:33.494 --> 00:32:35.119 line:82%
Please let my love succeed!

604
00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:42.119 line:82%
Oh god, the whole world has
seen it except Suji!

605
00:32:43.578 --> 00:32:45.411 line:82%
They should have come looking
for me by now?!

606
00:32:47.536 --> 00:32:49.953 line:82%
-Where is P.T. Master Singaram?
-He's in the staff room.

607
00:32:50.078 --> 00:32:51.536 line:82%
I’ll break his bones today.

608
00:32:51.953 --> 00:32:52.953 line:82%
Hey!

609
00:32:53.828 --> 00:32:54.494 line:82%
You!

610
00:32:54.536 --> 00:32:56.786 line:82%
What are you looking for there?

611
00:32:57.119 --> 00:33:00.203 line:82%
It’s been five minutes since I came.
You’re really slow.

612
00:33:06.703 --> 00:33:10.161 line:82%
Whoa, he has dismantled them,
piece by piece!

613
00:33:13.744 --> 00:33:15.369 line:82%
Did I send the pictures to them too?

614
00:33:21.536 --> 00:33:23.119 line:82%
Hey! Why did you hit my brother?

615
00:33:23.161 --> 00:33:24.869 line:82%
I hit him? When?

616
00:33:24.994 --> 00:33:28.078 line:82%
Once, when I was just a little kid,
I was having food with my family.

617
00:33:28.078 --> 00:33:29.619 line:82%
Suddenly, my father started choking.

618
00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:33.411 line:82%
My uncle told me to hit his back
a few times, so I did.

619
00:33:33.494 --> 00:33:35.453 line:82%
And just like that,
my father passed away.

620
00:33:35.494 --> 00:33:38.244 line:82%
My mother said,
'Oh god! You killed your father!'

621
00:33:38.328 --> 00:33:41.203 line:82%
She made me swear I’d never lay
a hand on anyone again.

622
00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:44.286 line:82%
Since then, I never even hit a nail
to hang his picture.

623
00:33:44.328 --> 00:33:45.536 line:82%
I used gum instead.

624
00:33:45.578 --> 00:33:46.994 line:82%
I’ve never hit a wall
while trying to park.

625
00:33:47.036 --> 00:33:48.994 line:82%
I’ve never, in my entire life,
hit the gym.

626
00:33:49.036 --> 00:33:51.286 line:82%
I’ve never hit a ball in cricket
or kicked a goal in football.

627
00:33:51.328 --> 00:33:54.536 line:82%
I’ve never thrown a stone at a dog
or swatted a mosquito.

628
00:33:54.578 --> 00:33:56.703 line:82%
I’ve never hit the wrong floor
button in an elevator.

629
00:33:56.744 --> 00:33:58.953 line:82%
I’ve never hit the pause button
nor the rewind button!

630
00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:01.328 line:82%
I’ve never hit the dance floor,
nor a coin on the carrom board.

631
00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:03.536 line:82%
I've never hit the horn,
nor have I ever hit the jackpot!

632
00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:05.744 line:82%
I’ve never hit the best angle in a selfie,
nor hit the right stroke in swimming.

633
00:34:05.786 --> 00:34:07.578 line:82%
I’ve never hit the right
punchline in a joke

634
00:34:07.619 --> 00:34:09.411 line:82%
Nor hit a high score in any game!

635
00:34:09.494 --> 00:34:11.078 line:82%
I’ve never hit the right
speed while driving!

636
00:34:11.161 --> 00:34:14.578 line:82%
I’ve never hit snooze on my alarm,
nor hit a sweet spot in my diet!

637
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:16.286 line:82%
I’ve never hit the right balance in life.
nor a hundred on a test.

638
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:17.994 line:82%
Nor have I...
Come here, you!

639
00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:20.119 line:82%
-What is it?
-Lend me your ears.

640
00:34:20.744 --> 00:34:23.578 line:82%
-I've never hit that too!
-Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!

641
00:34:24.203 --> 00:34:26.119 line:82%
Stop with the nonsense, you freak!

642
00:34:28.078 --> 00:34:29.578 line:82%
Someone who never hit anything,

643
00:34:30.036 --> 00:34:32.536 line:82%
broke my mother’s promise
to hit only one thing.

644
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:34.494 line:82%
And that’s to hit on Suji!

645
00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:37.786 line:82%
I took those pictures just to find
a place in her heart!

646
00:34:38.786 --> 00:34:40.619 line:82%
Just like a baby cries for milk,

647
00:34:41.161 --> 00:34:43.328 line:82%
to make my love work,

648
00:34:43.953 --> 00:34:46.953 line:82%
I don’t eat, sleep, smile, or even think!

649
00:34:48.078 --> 00:34:50.578 line:82%
I stand here, broken and scarred
by my love for her!

650
00:34:52.078 --> 00:34:56.078 line:82%
Only people like us know how
hard it is to find a beautiful girl!

651
00:35:01.286 --> 00:35:06.911 line:82%
For my love to succeed,
you all need to pray for me!

652
00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:17.619 line:82%
Shut up!

653
00:35:18.536 --> 00:35:19.994 line:82%
What did I ask and what are
you going on about?

654
00:35:20.078 --> 00:35:20.911 line:82%
Get out!

655
00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:22.244 line:82%
Leave!

656
00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:23.869 line:82%
Get lost!

657
00:35:24.953 --> 00:35:26.578 line:82%
Wait, wait. I’m going...

658
00:35:27.203 --> 00:35:30.203 line:82%
I figured they’d hand it to me,
not toss it at us like this.

659
00:35:30.244 --> 00:35:31.828 line:82%
Give me a second!

660
00:35:32.161 --> 00:35:34.036 line:82%
You're insulting me by saying
this freak hit me?

661
00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:35.786 line:82%
Buns are for eating,

662
00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:37.328 line:82%
not attacking.
Damn you all!

663
00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:41.453 line:82%
Thank goodness I escaped because
they were all patients.

664
00:35:41.703 --> 00:35:43.661 line:82%
Or they would’ve
made me one of them!

665
00:35:46.328 --> 00:35:48.161 line:82%
Hey, what are you doing here?

666
00:35:49.078 --> 00:35:50.411 line:82%
Tell me the way!

667
00:35:50.578 --> 00:35:51.578 line:82%
A way?

668
00:35:51.744 --> 00:35:53.161 line:82%
Go straight, then take a right.

669
00:35:53.244 --> 00:35:55.619 line:82%
There’s an auto stand there,
and they know all the routes

670
00:35:55.703 --> 00:35:57.286 line:82%
-Just ask them and go.
-Hey, hey!

671
00:35:57.328 --> 00:35:58.786 line:82%
Are you kidding? Listen!

672
00:35:58.828 --> 00:36:04.203 line:82%
From the tables and chairs to the kitchen
and booze, you’ve ruined my bar!

673
00:36:04.244 --> 00:36:05.453 line:82%
And now I’ve lost seven lakhs!

674
00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:08.453 line:82%
My partner kicked me out
until I get the money.

675
00:36:08.494 --> 00:36:09.661 line:82%
Give me the money!

676
00:36:09.828 --> 00:36:13.619 line:82%
Even Malaiarasan and his men have admitted
I wasn’t the one fighting the other day.

677
00:36:13.744 --> 00:36:15.786 line:82%
-Why don’t you believe me?
-Hey! Don’t lie!

678
00:36:15.953 --> 00:36:18.703 line:82%
I saw you covering your face
with my own eyes!

679
00:36:19.203 --> 00:36:21.328 line:82%
-I was in the bathroom...
-Bathroom what? Tell me!

680
00:36:21.369 --> 00:36:24.869 line:82%
Hey! I broke Malaiarasan’s hand
and destroyed your bar as well.

681
00:36:24.911 --> 00:36:27.536 line:82%
How could I let them go when they
raised their hands on Suji?

682
00:36:27.744 --> 00:36:28.744 line:82%
Thank you!

683
00:36:29.286 --> 00:36:31.661 line:82%
You’ve admitted it without any drink.

684
00:36:31.744 --> 00:36:33.494 line:82%
-Now, pay me.
-Hey, listen now.

685
00:36:33.578 --> 00:36:38.578 line:82%
Everything I said was a lie for my love!
I swear, I didn’t break your bar.

686
00:36:38.703 --> 00:36:40.244 line:82%
Really? You didn’t do it?

687
00:36:40.286 --> 00:36:41.286 line:82%
Who said that?

688
00:36:41.328 --> 00:36:43.203 line:82%
I’d kill for Suji!

689
00:36:43.328 --> 00:36:47.619 line:82%
If I’d done that and gone to jail,
who would take care of her like I do?

690
00:36:47.661 --> 00:36:52.286 line:82%
That’s why I beat them up and
destroyed your bar. Know that!

691
00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:54.286 line:82%
Stop talking nonsense!

692
00:36:54.328 --> 00:36:57.494 line:82%
If I don’t get seven lakhs in four days,
I’ll kill you!

693
00:36:57.578 --> 00:36:59.369 line:82%
-Come on, man, understand.
-Understand what?

694
00:36:59.494 --> 00:37:00.494 line:82%
Understand what?

695
00:37:00.536 --> 00:37:02.494 line:82%
Oh god, she’s coming and going,

696
00:37:02.578 --> 00:37:04.244 line:82%
and I’m losing my mind talking
all this nonsense.

697
00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:05.453 line:82%
Are you insulting me?

698
00:37:05.578 --> 00:37:09.453 line:82%
Yes, I am! Things break in a fight.
What do you want now?

699
00:37:09.494 --> 00:37:10.411 line:82%
Things break?

700
00:37:11.994 --> 00:37:13.703 line:82%
How do I look to you?

701
00:37:15.828 --> 00:37:18.119 line:82%
You look like a buffalo without horns.
What now?

702
00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:19.619 line:82%
-Hey!
-Just stop!

703
00:37:19.661 --> 00:37:21.286 line:82%
-You just want your seven lakhs, right?
-Yes.

704
00:37:21.328 --> 00:37:23.453 line:82%
I’ve got an estate in Ooty.
I’ll sell a small piece of that...

705
00:37:23.536 --> 00:37:25.328 line:82%
and settle your money. Okay?

706
00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:28.578 line:82%
-Yeah, when will--
-Hey! He said he’ll pay you, right? Leave!

707
00:37:28.744 --> 00:37:31.911 line:82%
Yes, listen to that respectable
elder. Won’t you?

708
00:37:32.078 --> 00:37:34.078 line:82%
Listen, he’ll pay you back in a week.

709
00:37:34.203 --> 00:37:36.494 line:82%
If not, take him and rip his life out.

710
00:37:36.536 --> 00:37:38.036 line:82%
-I guarantee it.
-Yes, do that!

711
00:37:38.578 --> 00:37:39.453 line:82%
One week.

712
00:37:39.536 --> 00:37:43.369 line:82%
If I don’t get the money in a week,
just as he said, I’ll rip your life out!

714
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:46.119 line:82%
Go on, pay him back.

715
00:37:46.203 --> 00:37:48.119 line:82%
Why did you suggest that?
You, stop!

716
00:37:48.203 --> 00:37:50.369 line:82%
-I’ll deal with you in a week.
-Hey, let’s talk about this first.

717
00:37:50.411 --> 00:37:52.078 line:82%
I’ve given the guarantee.

718
00:37:52.119 --> 00:37:54.536 line:82%
Who are you to
give a guarantee on my life?

719

a sponsorship from the shoe company.

Move. How did it happen?

-No idea, sir.
-Get the van!

787
00:42:21.453 --> 00:42:22.453 line:82%
How is he?

788
00:42:22.494 --> 00:42:24.411 line:82%

Let’s head to the police station
right away.

791
00:42:27.619 --> 00:42:29.994 line:82%
-Police station?
-Yes, just listen to him.

792
00:42:30.161 --> 00:42:34.911 line:82%
Sir, Gokul didn’t fall by himself.
They threw him.

793
00:42:35.203 --> 00:42:36.203 line:82%
You heard him?

794
00:42:36.244 --> 00:42:37.453 line:82%
What are you talking about?

795
00:42:37.786 --> 00:42:41.078 line:82%
Hey, you took the wrong can.
Go get the spirit can!

796
00:42:51.203 --> 00:42:52.953 line:82%
Hey, did you mix up the cans?

797
00:42:54.994 --> 00:42:57.369 line:82%
Chuck it, no one can know he
fainted from our spirit.

798
00:42:57.536 --> 00:42:58.994 line:82%
Just toss him off the floor.

799
00:42:59.161 --> 00:43:00.328 line:82%
I’ll handle the rest.

800
00:43:01.286 --> 00:43:02.578 line:82%
Poor Gokul, sir.

801
00:43:02.744 --> 00:43:04.953 line:82%
Tomorrow is his birthday.

802
00:43:05.203 --> 00:43:07.328 line:82%
We can’t let this slide!
Let’s go, sir.

803
00:43:07.411 --> 00:43:08.994 line:82%
Madam, hold on a minute!

804
00:43:09.203 --> 00:43:11.786 line:82%
Sir! What happened wasn’t an accident.

805
00:43:11.869 --> 00:43:13.744 line:82%
The boy drank their factory spirit.

806
00:43:13.786 --> 00:43:15.203 line:82%
-You should arrest--
-Wait, madam.

807
00:43:15.244 --> 00:43:17.411 line:82%
Listen to what the boy's
parents have to say.

808
00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.494 line:82%
Hey, speak.

809
00:43:18.661 --> 00:43:20.786 line:82%
A lizard fell into the sambar
we made this morning.

810
00:43:20.953 --> 00:43:23.953 line:82%
My son ate it without realizing,
and then he fainted at school, sir.

811
00:43:24.078 --> 00:43:26.703 line:82%
Did you hear that?
Hey, go check on your son.

812
00:43:27.078 --> 00:43:28.869 line:82%
Go! Go on now!

813
00:43:28.953 --> 00:43:29.994 line:82%
That's a lie!

814
00:43:30.161 --> 00:43:32.869 line:82%
Sir, he has threatened them.

815
00:43:32.994 --> 00:43:34.953 line:82%
I’ll file a complaint, an FIR--

816
00:43:34.994 --> 00:43:35.869 line:82%
-FIR?!
-Sir!

817
00:43:35.953 --> 00:43:36.994 line:82%
Don’t touch me.

818
00:43:37.828 --> 00:43:41.036 line:82%
Listen, teacher.
Teach the kids, not me.

819
00:43:41.161 --> 00:43:42.953 line:82%
His parents have admitted to
what happened.

820
00:43:42.994 --> 00:43:43.828 line:82%
Shut up and leave.

821
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:45.953 line:82%
You did all of this, and now you have
the nerve to talk like that?

822
00:43:46.036 --> 00:43:46.994 line:82%
Hey!

823
00:43:47.536 --> 00:43:48.994 line:82%
My brother is a politician.

824
00:43:49.411 --> 00:43:52.369 line:82%
He just removed your saree
to maintain his image.

825
00:43:52.494 --> 00:43:54.953 line:82%
If you keep going with this,
I’ll take your life.

826
00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:56.994 line:82%
Everyone, listen up!

827
00:43:57.619 --> 00:44:01.369 line:82%
As long as you don’t cross our path,
we’re good people.

828
00:44:01.661 --> 00:44:03.328 line:82%
But try to cross us...

829
00:44:14.286 --> 00:44:15.828 line:82%
-Hey, Kamala!
-What?

830
00:44:15.869 --> 00:44:18.119 line:82%
You’ve gained weight since last time?
What’s going on?

831
00:44:18.161 --> 00:44:20.369 line:82%
Doesn’t matter about the weight!
My moves are as good as ever!

832
00:44:20.661 --> 00:44:21.661 line:82%
Want to challenge me?

833
00:44:21.703 --> 00:44:22.953 line:82%
Challenge? Me?

834
00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:24.994 line:82%
Hey, stop!
Change the beat.

835
00:44:29.578 --> 00:44:30.703 line:82%
Hey, Singaram!

836
00:44:30.994 --> 00:44:31.744 line:82%
You!

837
00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:33.869 line:82%
-Damn, it’s Pattasamy.
You promised to pay me back,

838
00:44:33.911 --> 00:44:35.078 line:82%
and now you’re cheating me?

839
00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:36.119 line:82%
Stop!

840
00:44:37.369 --> 00:44:38.661 line:82%
Where did he go?

841
00:44:41.994 --> 00:44:43.744 line:82%
Sir, he’s here!

842
00:44:44.744 --> 00:44:45.744 line:82%
Hey!

843
00:44:45.786 --> 00:44:48.078 line:82%
Damn it, you work at his bar? Hold this.

844
00:44:50.036 --> 00:44:51.036 line:82%
Good lord!

845
00:45:01.953 --> 00:45:02.786 line:82%
Stay put!

846
00:45:02.828 --> 00:45:03.994 line:82%
It’s done. Leave.

847
00:45:04.203 --> 00:45:06.578 line:82%
Next one! Come on, sit.

848
00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:07.578 line:82%
For what?

849
00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:10.161 line:82%
-You’re here to wear the costume, right?
-I’m not here for that.

850
00:45:24.078 --> 00:45:26.369 line:82%
Come on, hurry up!
Move it faster!

851
00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:33.244 line:82%
Hey, check if there’s an issue
with the main board.

852
00:45:33.328 --> 00:45:34.328 line:82%
Okay, sir.

853
00:45:45.953 --> 00:45:48.411 line:82%
-Hey, what’s happening?
-I’ll check, sir.

854
00:46:26.036 --> 00:46:27.369 line:82%
Hey, go check what that sound is.

855
00:46:27.411 --> 00:46:28.411 line:82%
Come on!

856
00:48:16.328 --> 00:48:19.411 line:82%
If you keep going with this,
I’ll take your life.

857
00:48:44.744 --> 00:48:45.786 line:82%
It's spinning.

858
00:48:49.203 --> 00:48:50.744 line:82%
Stop, stop, stop!

859
00:48:50.953 --> 00:48:52.661 line:82%
It's pointing to me. I'll kill him!

860
00:48:52.744 --> 00:48:54.328 line:82%
No, it's pointing to me. I’ll do it.

861
00:48:54.328 --> 00:48:55.703 line:82%
-No, I'll do it.
-Wait!

862
00:48:55.869 --> 00:48:57.744 line:82%
I’ll spin it again.
Whoever it points to, can kill him.

863
00:48:57.744 --> 00:48:59.994 line:82%
Damn, they’re gambling with my life.

864
00:49:00.078 --> 00:49:02.911 line:82%
We should’ve killed you last time.
Letting you go was a mistake.

865
00:49:02.953 --> 00:49:05.119 line:82%
Once my boss is back from the hospital,
I’ll cut you into pieces.

866
00:49:05.203 --> 00:49:09.286 line:82%
Is my life a birthday cake?
I did nothing!

867
00:49:11.911 --> 00:49:13.119 line:82%
It didn’t break by itself.

868
00:49:13.161 --> 00:49:15.578 line:82%
It’s because of his eyes!
This is
Nokku Varmam!

869
00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:18.494 line:82%
You idiot!
I'm telling you I did nothing!

870
00:49:18.536 --> 00:49:20.286 line:82%
Then why did you go into the
godown in costume?

871
00:49:20.328 --> 00:49:21.328 line:82%
That...

872
00:49:24.869 --> 00:49:27.161 line:82%
I wore the costume to hide from him!

873
00:49:27.286 --> 00:49:28.453 line:82%
Apply more of it!

874
00:49:29.161 --> 00:49:30.453 line:82%
But he came before me.

875
00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:32.369 line:82%
I turned away, and the H.M. was there.

876
00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:34.203 line:82%
I didn’t know what to do.

877
00:49:34.244 --> 00:49:35.244 line:82%
Hello, sir.

878
00:49:35.369 --> 00:49:39.036 line:82%
You used to always wear gold jewelry.
Now you look so simple?

879
00:49:39.036 --> 00:49:40.619 line:82%
It’s all because of that
dimwit Singaram!

880
00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:43.494 line:82%
I sold all my gold just to buy a new lorry.

881
00:49:43.536 --> 00:49:46.036 line:82%
But when I get him, his funeral
offerings will be next.

882
00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:48.494 line:82%
I’ll cut him into pieces and
sell him at the market.

883
00:49:48.536 --> 00:49:49.911 line:82%
Singaram! Where are you?

884
00:49:49.994 --> 00:49:50.994 line:82%
I won't spare you!

885
00:49:51.036 --> 00:49:52.703 line:82%
The Lord has arrived! Oh, lord!

886
00:49:53.744 --> 00:49:55.161 line:82%
I’ve seen this lord before…

887
00:49:55.203 --> 00:49:56.869 line:82%
At the temple, you idiot!

888
00:49:57.036 --> 00:49:59.161 line:82%
Wherever I went, he was there.

889
00:49:59.286 --> 00:50:00.953 line:82%
So, I jumped into a lorry that was parked.

890
00:50:01.161 --> 00:50:03.119 line:82%
The driver started driving off
just as I sat down.

891
00:50:03.244 --> 00:50:05.494 line:82%
Driver, stop the vehicle!

892
00:50:06.619 --> 00:50:07.953 line:82%
-Him again?
-Who’s that?

893
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:10.661 line:82%
It’s like trying to hide from a snake
inside its own den.

894
00:50:11.369 --> 00:50:13.494 line:82%
I got into his lorry to escape him.

895
00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:15.953 line:82%
A little while later, the lorry stopped.

896
00:50:15.953 --> 00:50:17.078 line:82%
I bought a new lorry.

897
00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:19.703 line:82%
Prayed in the morning, spoke to the boss,
and he agreed to give me the load.

898
00:50:19.744 --> 00:50:20.786 line:82%
Wait, let me confirm.

899
00:50:20.953 --> 00:50:22.369 line:82%
I want my life to prosper again.

900
00:50:22.744 --> 00:50:27.328 line:82%
To escape that damn buffalo,
I entered the company.

901
00:50:27.661 --> 00:50:30.994 line:82%
That’s when I saw your man,
beaten and hanging.

902
00:50:31.578 --> 00:50:33.494 line:82%
And, I saw the guy
you’re looking for.

903
00:50:33.536 --> 00:50:35.244 line:82%
How was he in person?

904
00:50:35.869 --> 00:50:37.078 line:82%
He looked just like me!

905
00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:39.119 line:82%
Why couldn't you wear another costume?

906
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:40.786 line:82%
Why the same one as mine?

907
00:50:40.869 --> 00:50:42.911 line:82%
It’s fine. I’m Singaram.

908
00:50:43.036 --> 00:50:45.494 line:82%
Just give me your name, address,
or phone number before you leave.

909
00:50:45.619 --> 00:50:47.494 line:82%
Why would I give you my details
while I’m in disguise?

910
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:50.078 line:82%
I’m wearing one too!
Didn’t I tell you my name?

911
00:50:50.203 --> 00:50:51.203 line:82%
Tell me, sir.

912
00:50:51.244 --> 00:50:54.744 line:82%
It might help when the
terrorists catch us. Please!

913
00:50:55.453 --> 00:50:57.286 line:82%
He's in full on fight mode!

914
00:50:57.536 --> 00:50:58.953 line:82%
So, you didn't burn the factory?

915
00:50:59.036 --> 00:51:01.494 line:82%
He threw it.
I caught it and dropped it.

916
00:51:01.703 --> 00:51:03.828 line:82%
-I don’t understand.
-I don’t either!

917
00:51:14.119 --> 00:51:15.536 line:82%
Singaram, it's you!

918
00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:23.661 line:82%
-Fire! Fire!
-Oh, no! My lorry.

919
00:51:24.828 --> 00:51:27.161 line:82%
Hey, you've destroyed my future!

920
00:51:27.786 --> 00:51:32.036 line:82%
Your men thought it was me
and dragged me here.

921
00:51:32.328 --> 00:51:34.786 line:82%
He’s really good at making
believable lies.

922
00:51:34.828 --> 00:51:35.828 line:82%
Really?

923
00:51:42.078 --> 00:51:43.786 line:82%
-Sir, we’ve got the guy.
-Sir…

924
00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:46.744 line:82%
you should be judge for this.

925
00:51:46.828 --> 00:51:51.619 line:82%
Who’s impersonating who?
I don’t get it.

926
00:51:51.661 --> 00:51:54.536 line:82%
He keeps beating you up,
yet you keep locking me up.

927
00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:56.036 line:82%
Hey, get lost.

928
00:51:56.161 --> 00:51:57.536 line:82%
Nice to meet you.

929
00:52:00.786 --> 00:52:02.786 line:82%
Brother, be careful with your neck.

930
00:52:03.703 --> 00:52:08.203 line:82%
Don’t flare your nostrils too much,
insects might mistake them for caves.

931
00:52:08.328 --> 00:52:09.911 line:82%
That’s a huge hole.

932
00:52:12.119 --> 00:52:14.494 line:82%
See, he’s turning like a table fan.

933
00:52:14.744 --> 00:52:16.661 line:82%
You’ve crushed me so much.

934
00:52:18.578 --> 00:52:19.703 line:82%
Why did you let him go, sir?

935
00:52:19.869 --> 00:52:21.703 line:82%
You think he’s worth it?

936
00:52:21.953 --> 00:52:24.494 line:82%
Someone’s messing with our family.

937
00:52:24.786 --> 00:52:27.036 line:82%
First, he beat me up when I was drunk.

938
00:52:27.286 --> 00:52:30.536 line:82%
Now, he came in costume to beat you
and destroy the factory.

939
00:52:31.078 --> 00:52:32.953 line:82%
He’s using the festival to mess with us.

940
00:52:33.619 --> 00:52:36.953 line:82%
I don’t know who he is or
why he’s doing this.

941
00:52:38.119 --> 00:52:40.203 line:82%
Don’t ease up just because
the police are after him.

942
00:52:40.411 --> 00:52:42.203 line:82%
Send out our boys to look for him.

943
00:52:51.578 --> 00:52:53.828 line:82%
-You're here for a bath?
-No, I'm here kill you!

944
00:52:53.869 --> 00:52:56.911 line:82%
Listen, you can't fool me
like you fool them.

945
00:52:57.036 --> 00:53:00.911 line:82%
This time, I saw you beat them up
and burn my lorry!

946
00:53:01.078 --> 00:53:03.328 line:82%
It’s fifteen lakhs now for
the bar and the lorry.

947
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:04.411 line:82%
Pay me now!

948
00:53:04.536 --> 00:53:06.661 line:82%
Stop overthinking and messing
with your head.

949
00:53:06.703 --> 00:53:08.286 line:82%
Where would I get that kind of money?

950
00:53:08.328 --> 00:53:09.536 line:82%
Just let it go.

951
00:53:09.661 --> 00:53:10.661 line:82%
Let it go?

952
00:53:10.828 --> 00:53:13.286 line:82%
But you said you’d sell a piece
of your estate and settle my debts!

953
00:53:13.328 --> 00:53:16.744 line:82%
I don’t even own a speaker.
I just made that up.

954
00:53:16.911 --> 00:53:19.828 line:82%
I’ll give you a free idea
to settle my debt.

955
00:53:19.869 --> 00:53:20.869 line:82%
What idea?

956
00:53:20.953 --> 00:53:23.869 line:82%
Why not kidnap a rich kid from
your school and get the money?

957
00:53:23.953 --> 00:53:24.953 line:82%
Kidnap?!

958
00:53:25.119 --> 00:53:28.536 line:82%
Oh, are you hesitating because
you're a teacher?

959
00:53:28.703 --> 00:53:31.078 line:82%
That’s something a real teacher
would worry about.

960
00:53:31.494 --> 00:53:35.578 line:82%
Listen, the richest kid in the school
is Mudiarasan’s son.

961
00:53:35.953 --> 00:53:38.578 line:82%
-Is he good for you?
-Hey! Mudiarasan’s son?

962
00:53:39.036 --> 00:53:41.661 line:82%
If we get caught,
they’ll chop off our heads!

963
00:53:41.703 --> 00:53:45.161 line:82%
Of all the rich kids in the school,
he’s the only soft-spoken one.

964
00:53:45.203 --> 00:53:46.744 line:82%
A soft one from that family?

965
00:53:48.744 --> 00:53:51.453 line:82%
Of course, you’ll laugh.
You have the money now.

966
00:53:52.203 --> 00:53:54.453 line:82%
Hey, I didn’t get anything.
I’ve only got my losses!

967
00:53:54.661 --> 00:53:56.578 line:82%
You should kidnap the boy tomorrow.

968
00:53:56.703 --> 00:54:00.161 line:82%
Or else, you’ll see the bad side
of Pattasamy!

969
00:54:01.453 --> 00:54:02.953 line:82%
Can I even do this?

970
00:54:03.244 --> 00:54:04.828 line:82%
Let me just give it a try.

971
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:07.661 line:82%
If it works out, I’ll start
kidnapping kids one by one

972
00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:10.328 line:82%
and buy some estates in Ooty.

973
00:54:44.661 --> 00:54:46.578 line:82%
Hey, come here.

974
00:54:47.078 --> 00:54:49.203 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom, sir.

975
00:54:49.328 --> 00:54:51.453 line:82%
It stinks in there.

976
00:54:51.536 --> 00:54:53.619 line:82%
Hold this kerchief to your nose.
It'll help.

977
00:54:53.703 --> 00:54:55.744 line:82%
-Okay, sir. Thank you.
-Alright.

978
00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:02.703 line:82%
He's still in there.

979
00:55:03.244 --> 00:55:05.203 line:82%
Which means, he's fainted.
Okay.

980
00:55:05.369 --> 00:55:07.078 line:82%
Sir, thanks. I used it.

981
00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:08.369 line:82%
I'll wash it and bring it tomorrow.

982
00:55:08.911 --> 00:55:11.036 line:82%
He used it and
is still walking normally?

983
00:55:11.119 --> 00:55:12.953 line:82%
This one didn’t work?

984
00:55:13.161 --> 00:55:14.828 line:82%
How did I miss this?

985
00:55:18.036 --> 00:55:19.703 line:82%
What happened to him?

986
00:55:28.536 --> 00:55:30.911 line:82%
Oh, that’s how I missed it!

987
00:55:31.036 --> 00:55:32.828 line:82%
He's always getting in the
way of my plans.

988
00:55:32.869 --> 00:55:33.869 line:82%
It's him!

989
00:55:34.203 --> 00:55:34.953 line:82%
Hello!

990
00:55:34.994 --> 00:55:36.244 line:82%
-What happened?
-Nothing.

991
00:55:36.286 --> 00:55:38.078 line:82%
A small mishap with the spray.

992
00:55:38.786 --> 00:55:39.703 line:82%
My mistake.

993
00:55:39.786 --> 00:55:41.244 line:82%
Next attempt will be a success.

994
00:55:42.869 --> 00:55:44.953 line:82%
One hit and you’re mine!

995
00:55:50.036 --> 00:55:51.453 line:82%
-Who’s that?!
-Hey, I found the stump.

996
00:55:51.494 --> 00:55:53.703 line:82%
Hey, hey. Stop running.

997
00:55:53.828 --> 00:55:55.036 line:82%
Stop before I get mad.

998
00:55:57.286 --> 00:55:58.119 line:82%
What?

999
00:55:58.203 --> 00:55:59.286 line:82%
You know what?

1000
00:55:59.328 --> 00:56:03.119 line:82%
Go practice with that stump and
become a big player like Dhoni!

1001
00:56:03.203 --> 00:56:05.869 line:82%
I’ll become Dhoni or Ronaldo.

1002
00:56:05.994 --> 00:56:07.203 line:82%
What’s it to you?

1003
00:56:07.244 --> 00:56:09.494 line:82%
-Taking our stumps...
-Okay, okay. Go on, sir.

1004
00:56:09.536 --> 00:56:11.911 line:82%
They’ve raised a demon, not a kid.

1005
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:15.453 line:82%
I worry about the world that has them!

1006
00:56:15.578 --> 00:56:16.744 line:82%
Submit this by tomorrow.

1007
00:56:16.869 --> 00:56:18.619 line:82%
-Note it down.
-Okay, miss.

1008
00:56:18.911 --> 00:56:20.786 line:82%
-Hi!
-It’s my birthday.

1009
00:56:20.786 --> 00:56:22.703 line:82%
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you, miss.

1010
00:56:22.911 --> 00:56:23.911 line:82%
God bless.

1011
00:56:24.619 --> 00:56:26.328 line:82%
Swetha, come here.

1012
00:56:38.036 --> 00:56:40.494 line:82%
-Where did you get this watch?
-My father gave it to me.

1013
00:56:50.494 --> 00:56:52.703 line:82%
Muthu, did you see Saravanan, sir?

1014
00:56:52.828 --> 00:56:55.119 line:82%
I think he went to the sports room.

1015
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:56.661 line:82%
Why are you so tensed?

1016
00:56:56.828 --> 00:56:59.036 line:82%
I saw the watch I gifted Ramya
on Swetha’s wrist.

1017
00:56:59.161 --> 00:57:00.786 line:82%
There'll be thousands of
watches in the same design.

1018
00:57:00.828 --> 00:57:03.494 line:82%
Maybe. But I’m sure that’s my watch.

1019
00:57:03.703 --> 00:57:04.869 line:82%
Swetha’s father has a pawn shop.

1020
00:57:04.953 --> 00:57:06.494 line:82%
We know Ramya was poor.

1021
00:57:06.578 --> 00:57:07.994 line:82%
Maybe they pawned it there.

1022
00:57:08.369 --> 00:57:11.869 line:82%
No, I saw her wearing it the day
she went missing!

1023
00:57:12.161 --> 00:57:13.203 line:82%
I have a doubt.

1024
00:57:13.328 --> 00:57:15.453 line:82%
That’s why I want to tell this
to Saravanan sir.

1025
00:57:15.494 --> 00:57:17.744 line:82%
He’s a new teacher.
What connection does he have with Ramya?

1026
00:57:17.786 --> 00:57:18.786 line:82%
That...

1027
00:57:22.203 --> 00:57:24.828 line:82%
Don’t tell anyone.
He’s not a PT master.

1028
00:57:25.078 --> 00:57:26.078 line:82%
He’s a cop.

1029
00:57:26.286 --> 00:57:29.078 line:82%
He’s here to investigate Ramya’s case
under the guise of a teacher.

1030
00:57:29.286 --> 00:57:32.203 line:82%
If we tell him this, it could help
his investigation, right?

1031
00:57:32.286 --> 00:57:33.286 line:82%
Teacher!

1032
00:57:33.453 --> 00:57:36.161 line:82%
What if Ramya ran away with
the pawned money?

1033
00:57:36.494 --> 00:57:39.869 line:82%
Why don’t we check at the shop and
then inform Saravanan sir?

1034
00:58:18.286 --> 00:58:19.369 line:82%
Hey!

1035
00:58:19.578 --> 00:58:21.411 line:82%
What are you doing? Stop!

1036
00:58:26.494 --> 00:58:28.244 line:82%
Sir, sir. Please let us go!

1037
00:58:28.911 --> 00:58:30.786 line:82%
You’ve recorded videos of girls
in the school bathroom.

1038
00:58:30.869 --> 00:58:32.828 line:82%
And you're smoking pot as well.
Let’s go to the police!

1039
00:58:32.953 --> 00:58:35.994 line:82%
Sir, please don’t tell anyone.
Our lives will be in danger.

1040
00:58:36.036 --> 00:58:37.994 line:82%
Your life is in danger?
What are you saying?

1041
00:58:38.036 --> 00:58:40.411 line:82%
Yes, sir. If Mutharasu finds out,
he’ll kill us.

1042
00:58:42.244 --> 00:58:43.578 line:82%
-Mutharasu?
-Yes, sir.

1043
00:58:43.619 --> 00:58:45.744 line:82%
He was the one who always brought the
pot to school, hidden in cigarettes.

1044
00:58:46.453 --> 00:58:49.619 line:82%
Even if we didn’t want it,
he forced us into that habit, sir.

1045
00:58:50.078 --> 00:58:53.161 line:82%
Sir, when Ramya found out about
the video, he killed her as well.

1046
00:58:55.161 --> 00:58:57.786 line:82%
One day, Mutharasu was watching
a video at home...

1047
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:01.786 line:82%
-Muthu, your uncle is calling you.
-I’m coming.

1048
00:59:09.578 --> 00:59:11.119 line:82%
I’ll get it done tomorrow, uncle.

1049
00:59:30.994 --> 00:59:32.244 line:82%
You rascal!

1050
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:36.453 line:82%
-Ramya, we won’t do it again.
-What are you doing?

1051
00:59:36.494 --> 00:59:37.494 line:82%
Hold her!

1052
00:59:37.619 --> 00:59:38.619 line:82%
Lift her up.

1053
00:59:39.703 --> 00:59:42.328 line:82%
We felt so bad for Ramya.

1054
00:59:42.661 --> 00:59:45.078 line:82%
We told him not to,
but he didn’t listen.

1055
00:59:45.203 --> 00:59:46.203 line:82%
Let me go!

1056
00:59:46.328 --> 00:59:48.536 line:82%
-Let me go!
-Muthu, don't do it.

1057
00:59:48.786 --> 00:59:50.578 line:82%
-Mutharasu!
-Let me go, Muthu!

1058
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:00.661 line:82%
Suji?

1059
01:00:01.203 --> 01:00:03.119 line:82%
-Go fast.
-Okay, ma’am.

1060
01:00:04.744 --> 01:00:09.411 line:82%
Hey, if you dare tell anyone
what happened here, I’ll end you both.

1061
01:00:09.494 --> 01:00:10.994 line:82%
We won’t, sir.

1062
01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:17.369 line:82%
Saravanan sir is calling.

1063
01:00:19.244 --> 01:00:21.578 line:82%
-Hello, Saravanan.
-Hello, Sujitha! Don't go with him!

1064
01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:22.661 line:82%
Get out of the car right now!

1065
01:00:24.619 --> 01:00:25.619 line:82%
-Hello, Saravanan.
-Hello?

1066
01:00:25.869 --> 01:00:27.203 line:82%
-Hello?
-Sujitha?!

1067
01:00:27.369 --> 01:00:29.369 line:82%
-Hello, Saravanan?
-Can you hear me? Hello?

1068
01:00:29.453 --> 01:00:30.828 line:82%
I can’t hear anything over
this festival noise.

1069
01:00:30.869 --> 01:00:32.328 line:82%
-Hello, don’t go with him!
-Saravanan?

1070
01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:33.494 line:82%
Get the window up!

1071
01:00:33.703 --> 01:00:35.578 line:82%
-Hello, get out of the car.
-Can you hear me?

1072
01:00:35.744 --> 01:00:37.578 line:82%
-Teacher?
-Damn, I can't hear anything!

1073
01:00:37.619 --> 01:00:38.619 line:82%
Stop honking!

1074
01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:40.244 line:82%
Teacher, they won’t move
unless I honk.

1075
01:00:40.286 --> 01:00:41.619 line:82%
Put your phone down.
Talk to him later.

1076
01:00:41.703 --> 01:00:43.494 line:82%
Saravanan, I can't hear you.
I'll call you later.

1077
01:00:43.536 --> 01:00:45.161 line:82%
Hello, Suji! Hello?!

1078
01:00:47.536 --> 01:00:49.494 line:82%
Teacher, this is Swetha’s father's shop.
You can go!

1079
01:01:01.494 --> 01:01:03.369 line:82%
Who pawned this watch to you?

1080
01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:06.411 line:82%
Brick Kiln' Murugesan, madam.
He took the money and left.

1081
01:01:06.494 --> 01:01:09.828 line:82%
He works at my family’s
brick kiln, teacher. Let’s go!

1082
01:01:12.911 --> 01:01:14.161 line:82%
Drive faster!

1083
01:01:17.411 --> 01:01:20.411 line:82%
If the boy is out here driving,
what the hell is Singaram doing at school?

1084
01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:25.203 line:82%
-Hello.
-Where are you?

1085
01:01:25.286 --> 01:01:29.619 line:82%
You just ruined my plan with your call!
I almost had him.

1086
01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.161 line:82%
Stop lying, you idiot!

1087
01:01:31.286 --> 01:01:32.703 line:82%
The boy isn’t even at school.

1088
01:01:32.786 --> 01:01:34.994 line:82%
I just saw him in a car with a teacher.

1089
01:01:35.036 --> 01:01:37.578 line:82%
I’ll follow them and
send you my live location.

1090
01:01:37.619 --> 01:01:39.161 line:82%
At least get there fast!

1091
01:01:41.619 --> 01:01:43.578 line:82%
Sir, where was the procession
ten minutes ago?

1092
01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:46.453 line:82%
-It was passing through
Theradi
Street.
-
Theradi
Street? Okay!

1093
01:02:04.494 --> 01:02:05.786 line:82%
This is the place, teacher.

1094
01:02:10.578 --> 01:02:13.286 line:82%
After the flag hoisting,
there’ll be a grand procession.

1095
01:02:13.494 --> 01:02:15.078 line:82%
Tomorrow is the Devi festival,

1096
01:02:15.203 --> 01:02:17.494 line:82%
and on the fourth day, Mayana Kollai.

1097
01:02:17.536 --> 01:02:19.578 line:82%
The whole town will be celebrating!

1098
01:02:41.994 --> 01:02:43.578 line:82%
Teacher, that’s Murugesan!

1099
01:02:47.869 --> 01:02:49.619 line:82%
Who gave you the watch
you pawned?

1100
01:02:49.953 --> 01:02:50.994 line:82%
How did you get the watch?

1101
01:02:51.286 --> 01:02:52.828 line:82%
She’s asking you, answer her!

1102
01:02:52.953 --> 01:02:54.453 line:82%
How did the watch end up
at the pawn shop?

1103
01:02:54.578 --> 01:02:55.578 line:82%
I’m sorry!

1104
01:02:55.786 --> 01:02:59.744 line:82%
It looked like gold, so I pawned it
before I burned the body.

1105
01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:02.828 line:82%
What?! You burned her?!

1106
01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:08.078 line:82%
-Hey, burn her like we always do.
-Got it.

1107
01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.286 line:82%
Why do you keep digging into this?

1108
01:03:11.494 --> 01:03:12.703 line:82%
Are you trying to play detective?

1109
01:03:12.828 --> 01:03:14.869 line:82%
She’s dead.
Get it now?

1110
01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:26.786 line:82%
I pay you well, you useless idiot.

1111
01:03:26.911 --> 01:03:29.244 line:82%
Now, because of that damn watch,
this one knows everything.

1112
01:03:29.453 --> 01:03:30.578 line:82%
Kill her too.

1113
01:04:09.411 --> 01:04:11.286 line:82%
She must be here. Search!

1114
01:04:12.744 --> 01:04:13.744 line:82%
Round her up!

1115
01:04:14.494 --> 01:04:16.619 line:82%
-Go that side.
-Check the back entrance.

1116
01:04:18.536 --> 01:04:20.911 line:82%
-Make sure not a single spot is left!
-You got her?

1117
01:04:22.161 --> 01:04:24.203 line:82%
Search every corner thoroughly!

1118
01:04:25.994 --> 01:04:26.994 line:82%
Where is she?!

1119
01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:31.161 line:82%
Hey! She's there.

1120
01:04:31.244 --> 01:04:32.244 line:82%
Get her!

1121
01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:36.536 line:82%
-Don't let her escape.
-Kill her now!

1122
01:04:37.703 --> 01:04:39.578 line:82%
-Round her up.
-You, stop!

1123
01:05:59.328 --> 01:06:00.328 line:82%
Sujitha!

1124
01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:09.453 line:82%
Stop.
Stop, you!

1125
01:06:10.244 --> 01:06:11.369 line:82%
You can't run anymore.

1126
01:06:16.328 --> 01:06:17.328 line:82%
Kill her now.

1127
01:06:43.953 --> 01:06:44.994 line:82%
Come on, fast!

1128
01:06:45.578 --> 01:06:47.411 line:82%
-Hop on.
-It's that way. Go!

1129
01:06:47.619 --> 01:06:48.411 line:82%
Quick!

1130
01:07:08.286 --> 01:07:09.286 line:82%
Climb.

1131
01:07:16.369 --> 01:07:18.744 line:82%
Oh, what?
You're all ganging up on me?

1132
01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:22.036 line:82%
-If my uncle finds out about this…
-Hey!

1133
01:07:22.328 --> 01:07:24.994 line:82%
I’ve already beaten up both your uncles.
Bring your father this time!

1134
01:07:25.078 --> 01:07:27.703 line:82%
What? He’s been dead for three years.
How will he come?

1135
01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:31.328 line:82%
Oh, he’ll come this time!

1136
01:07:31.411 --> 01:07:33.578 line:82%
What, scared?
Call your father!

1137
01:07:33.703 --> 01:07:35.203 line:82%
I’m not scared!
I’ll call him right now.

1138
01:07:35.494 --> 01:07:37.578 line:82%
-What is he doing?
-That’s the end for you all!

1139
01:07:46.869 --> 01:07:48.619 line:82%
-Hello.
-Hello, Dad!

1140
01:07:48.994 --> 01:07:50.578 line:82%
-They’re beating me up!
-Who?

1141
01:07:50.619 --> 01:07:51.661 line:82%
They’re trying to kill me!

1142
01:07:51.703 --> 01:07:52.953 line:82%
--Who?! Tell me!
-It's my-

1143
01:07:53.661 --> 01:07:55.244 line:82%
Hey, Mutharasu!

1144
01:07:55.661 --> 01:07:56.703 line:82%
Muthu!

1145
01:07:57.328 --> 01:07:59.036 line:82%
What did you do to my son?

1146
01:07:59.286 --> 01:08:01.494 line:82%
Muthu? Muthu?!

1147
01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:08.369 line:82%
Hey! If something happens to my son,
I'll kill you.

1148
01:08:16.494 --> 01:08:17.494 line:82%
Doctor?

1149
01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:19.494 line:82%
He’s slipped into a coma.

1150
01:08:19.536 --> 01:08:21.703 line:82%
We can’t say when he’ll recover.
Nurse!

1151
01:08:38.994 --> 01:08:40.828 line:82%
We don’t know who did this to our boy.

1152
01:08:41.286 --> 01:08:42.494 line:82%
Our entire family is raging!

1153
01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:44.536 line:82%
Tell me, did he have any issues
or fights at school?

1154
01:08:44.619 --> 01:08:46.661 line:82%
Sir, he was a good kid!

1155
01:08:46.744 --> 01:08:48.369 line:82%
He never got into any trouble or fights.

1156
01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:51.328 line:82%
Who could be so cruel to hurt
a boy like him?

1157
01:08:51.786 --> 01:08:54.578 line:82%
What an act!After everything you did!

1158
01:08:54.619 --> 01:08:55.994 line:82%
Hey, I’ll ask again.

1159
01:08:56.078 --> 01:08:57.411 line:82%
You were the last one to
take him somewhere.

1160
01:08:57.494 --> 01:08:58.786 line:82%
Where did you take him
during school hours?

1161
01:08:58.911 --> 01:09:00.286 line:82%
How many times should
I repeat myself?

1162
01:09:00.328 --> 01:09:02.119 line:82%
I found Ramya’s watch.

1163
01:09:02.244 --> 01:09:05.744 line:82%
When I inquired, they said Murugesan
from your kiln had pawned it.

1164
01:09:05.786 --> 01:09:08.369 line:82%
So we went there to question him.

1165
01:09:08.494 --> 01:09:11.953 line:82%
That’s when someone with a covered
face started beating everyone up.

1166
01:09:12.036 --> 01:09:13.161 line:82%
I got scared and ran away.

1167
01:09:13.244 --> 01:09:15.078 line:82%
That’s all I know!

1168
01:09:27.369 --> 01:09:28.703 line:82%
Damn, why are they looking at me?

1169
01:09:29.578 --> 01:09:32.328 line:82%
Suji, the guy who beat him up…

1170
01:09:33.786 --> 01:09:36.286 line:82%
he didn’t have curls like me, right?

1171
01:09:36.411 --> 01:09:37.411 line:82%
Nope.

1172
01:09:40.036 --> 01:09:42.036 line:82%
And he wasn’t as dark as me, right?

1173
01:09:42.119 --> 01:09:44.078 line:82%
Not too dark or fair…
more like brown.

1174
01:09:44.161 --> 01:09:45.536 line:82%
-It's brown.
-Hey!

1175
01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:47.536 line:82%
Even if you confessed,
I wouldn’t believe it was you.

1176
01:09:48.119 --> 01:09:49.911 line:82%
I know you’re useless.

1177
01:09:50.203 --> 01:09:51.203 line:82%
Useless?!

1178
01:09:51.369 --> 01:09:53.411 line:82%
If we get that guy,
we’ll get to the bottom of this.

1179
01:09:53.494 --> 01:09:56.703 line:82%
Yeah, right. He’s standing right
in front of you, and you found nothing!

1180
01:09:57.036 --> 01:09:58.619 line:82%
You guys are more useless than me.

1181
01:09:58.703 --> 01:10:01.286 line:82%
-Everyone, leave.
-Alright, let’s go. Come on!

1182
01:10:01.411 --> 01:10:04.161 line:82%
-Teacher, give your statement before you leave.
-Sure, sir.

1183
01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:07.703 line:82%
Madam, I’ll need your ID.

1184
01:10:09.786 --> 01:10:13.619 line:82%
Sir, this is important.
Keep it to yourself.

1185
01:10:13.786 --> 01:10:15.661 line:82%
No idea who filed the complaint,

1186
01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:19.786 line:82%
but they’ve sent a special officer from
the Commissioner’s office to spy on you.

1187
01:10:19.869 --> 01:10:21.619 line:82%
There’s a black sheep among you.

1188
01:10:21.661 --> 01:10:23.203 line:82%
Could the cop be behind all this?

1189
01:10:23.244 --> 01:10:26.203 line:82%
No, an undercover cop wouldn’t
stir things up like this.

1190
01:10:26.286 --> 01:10:27.286 line:82%
Find out who it is.

1191
01:10:27.369 --> 01:10:30.369 line:82%
I’ll reach out to my source at the
Commissioner’s office and get full details.

1192
01:11:11.911 --> 01:11:13.661 line:82%
Brother, why are you here?

1193
01:11:13.994 --> 01:11:15.994 line:82%
-Where is Muthu?
-He's in the ICU.

1194
01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:22.411 line:82%
Uncle...

1195
01:11:22.536 --> 01:11:24.119 line:82%
Sir, you can't enter the ICU.

1196
01:11:24.286 --> 01:11:26.786 line:82%
If something happens to my son,
I'll kill you all!

1197
01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:32.036 line:82%
I'm living in hiding for you two!

1198
01:11:32.119 --> 01:11:33.619 line:82%
And you couldn't even protect my son?

1199
01:11:34.869 --> 01:11:36.953 line:82%
-Did you catch the one who did this?
-We're searching.

1200
01:11:38.036 --> 01:11:39.703 line:82%
-None of the others saw him?
-Brother…

1201
01:11:40.161 --> 01:11:41.453 line:82%
our boy is lucky.

1202
01:11:41.578 --> 01:11:43.786 line:82%
The doctor said none of the others
will make it out alive.

1203
01:11:59.786 --> 01:12:02.203 line:82%
Just like a mechanic breaks down cars,

1204
01:12:02.411 --> 01:12:04.953 line:82%
you took down three men in their family

1205
01:12:05.078 --> 01:12:06.744 line:82%
and now you're sitting here all innocent?

1206
01:12:06.953 --> 01:12:09.286 line:82%
My blood pressure is skyrocketing
just looking at you!

1207
01:12:09.411 --> 01:12:11.828 line:82%
I should've ratted you out
at the hospital!

1208
01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.786 line:82%
Do you even realize what
would've happened to you?

1209
01:12:14.161 --> 01:12:15.411 line:82%
Then why didn’t you?

1210
01:12:15.453 --> 01:12:16.661 line:82%
Ask him to try.

1211
01:12:16.953 --> 01:12:21.661 line:82%
I'll just say he was the mastermind
behind all this and walk away.

1212
01:12:22.119 --> 01:12:23.619 line:82%
Should I make you his partner?

1213
01:12:23.661 --> 01:12:24.578 line:82%
Oh god! Me?!

1214
01:12:24.619 --> 01:12:27.536 line:82%
You're scared, aren’t you?
Same here. That’s why I kept my mouth shut.

1215
01:12:27.619 --> 01:12:28.828 line:82%
Saravanan!

1216
01:12:29.869 --> 01:12:30.744 line:82%
Get out of here.

1217
01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:32.328 line:82%
-Escape soon.
-Why?!

1218
01:12:32.369 --> 01:12:34.286 line:82%
They know there's an
undercover cop among them.

1219
01:12:34.328 --> 01:12:35.328 line:82%
They know?!

1220
01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.369 line:82%
Oh god!

1221
01:12:41.244 --> 01:12:42.244 line:82%
I'm dead.

1222
01:12:42.328 --> 01:12:44.286 line:82%
Oh god, this weirdo is
swooping in like a vulture!

1223
01:12:51.119 --> 01:12:52.578 line:82%
Why are you so scared, sir?

1224
01:12:54.744 --> 01:12:56.036 line:82%
I’m that cop.

1225
01:12:57.203 --> 01:12:58.494 line:82%
A cop?

1226
01:12:58.828 --> 01:13:00.869 line:82%
We’ve been receiving a lot of
complaints from Arasankottai.

1227
01:13:00.953 --> 01:13:03.661 line:82%
I want you to go there, investigate,
and report back to me.

1228
01:13:03.911 --> 01:13:05.411 line:82%
No one should know you’re a cop.

1229
01:13:07.786 --> 01:13:09.661 line:82%
Look… I’m actually a coward.

1230
01:13:10.328 --> 01:13:12.369 line:82%
I only got this job because
my father was a cop.

1231
01:13:12.494 --> 01:13:15.369 line:82%
I took it up just to make a living.

1232
01:13:16.036 --> 01:13:18.869 line:82%
They sent me here as a dummy officer

1233
01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.828 line:82%
just a formality to "investigate"
the missing girl case.

1234
01:13:20.869 --> 01:13:23.953 line:82%
If they find out I’m the cop,
I don't know what they'll do to me!

1235
01:13:26.078 --> 01:13:28.119 line:82%
Then why did you
pretend to be a cop?

1236
01:13:28.828 --> 01:13:30.286 line:82%
I never said I was!

1237
01:13:30.411 --> 01:13:32.369 line:82%
Then why did you beat them all up?!

1238
01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:36.536 line:82%
Tell me!

1239
01:13:40.536 --> 01:13:41.786 line:82%

Yes, sir.

1278
01:17:37.494 --> 01:17:40.036 line:82%
The Election Commission is set to
announce the dates tomorrow.

1279
01:17:40.453 --> 01:17:41.911 line:82%
Once that happens, security will tighten,

1280
01:17:42.244 --> 01:17:44.244 line:82%
and mobilizing election funds
won't be possible.

1281
01:17:44.369 --> 01:17:46.411 line:82%
We have 100 crores ready in the vehicle.

1282
01:17:46.619 --> 01:17:49.161 line:82%
I need you both to deliver it to
the district secretary.

1283
01:17:49.328 --> 01:17:53.328 line:82%
Sir, you’ve always treated me
like a daughter,

1284
01:17:53.619 --> 01:17:56.494 line:82%
which is why I’m asking.
Today is my wedding day.

1285
01:17:56.619 --> 01:17:58.744 line:82%
-I'm visting the temple this evening--
-What is this now?

1286
01:17:58.911 --> 01:17:59.994 line:82%
Ranipet is nearby.

1287
01:18:00.036 --> 01:18:01.578 line:82%
We’ll be back before evening. Come.

1288
01:18:01.786 --> 01:18:03.703 line:82%
It’s not just a few lakhs,
it’s 100 crores.

1289
01:18:03.828 --> 01:18:04.869 line:82%
It has to reach safely.

1290
01:18:05.328 --> 01:18:07.869 line:82%
There’s no one else I trust more
than the two of you.

1291
01:18:07.994 --> 01:18:10.161 line:82%
No issues, sir.
We’ll handle it.

1292
01:18:19.536 --> 01:18:21.328 line:82%
We’ve been waiting for this for so long…

1293
01:18:21.661 --> 01:18:23.411 line:82%
Our lives are about to change.

1294
01:18:23.744 --> 01:18:26.161 line:82%
Wait for me at the temple.
I’ll be there with a special gift.

1295
01:18:29.203 --> 01:18:30.536 line:82%
100 crores.

1296
01:18:30.953 --> 01:18:33.119 line:82%
The minister thinks
it’ll reach the voters,

1297
01:18:33.536 --> 01:18:38.869 line:82%
but the district secretary
will skim half.

1298
01:18:38.994 --> 01:18:42.453 line:82%
The rest will be split among
councillors and ward members.

1299
01:18:42.619 --> 01:18:46.078 line:82%
This is black money. If it disappears,
no one can file a complaint.

1300
01:18:46.411 --> 01:18:47.369 line:82%
So?

1301
01:18:48.119 --> 01:18:49.828 line:82%
Why beat around the bush?

1302
01:18:49.994 --> 01:18:52.536 line:82%
Why don’t we take it all for ourselves?

1303
01:18:52.744 --> 01:18:54.369 line:82%
What are you saying, brother?!

1304
01:18:54.911 --> 01:18:58.578 line:82%
A lifetime of work won’t
earn us this much.

1305
01:18:58.703 --> 01:19:00.661 line:82%
What’s the point of loyalty?

1306
01:19:00.828 --> 01:19:02.661 line:82%
We should be smart.

1307
01:19:03.078 --> 01:19:05.869 line:82%
Brother, if you say another word,
I’ll call the minister.

1308
01:19:06.119 --> 01:19:07.119 line:82%
No, sister!

1309
01:19:07.994 --> 01:19:10.078 line:82%
I was just testing you.

1310
01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:13.619 line:82%
Our boss has given us enough.
Why steal?

1311
01:19:21.994 --> 01:19:23.828 line:82%
What are you doing?
Why are you taking this route?

1312
01:19:23.994 --> 01:19:25.786 line:82%
There's a checkpost on the main road.

1313
01:19:25.911 --> 01:19:27.119 line:82%
No point in taking risks.

1314
01:19:27.203 --> 01:19:28.994 line:82%
We'll take this shorcut.

1315
01:19:32.161 --> 01:19:33.286 line:82%
What happened?

1316
01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:34.369 line:82%
Not sure.

1317
01:19:34.786 --> 01:19:36.869 line:82%
Wait here.
I’ll check.

1318
01:19:44.828 --> 01:19:46.453 line:82%
She won’t agree to our plan.

1319
01:19:46.578 --> 01:19:48.578 line:82%
She’s an orphan.

1320
01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:52.161 line:82%
Since the minister raised her,
she sees him as her father.

1321
01:19:52.536 --> 01:19:53.578 line:82%
She won’t let us take the money.

1322
01:19:53.703 --> 01:19:54.953 line:82%
Then why talk?

1323
01:19:55.119 --> 01:19:57.328 line:82%
Let’s just kill her!
One less share to split.

1324
01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:05.411 line:82%
Brother! Madhavi is missing!

1325
01:20:05.494 --> 01:20:06.494 line:82%
-What?!
-Look carefully!

1326
01:20:06.828 --> 01:20:08.744 line:82%
She was right here. Search!

1327
01:20:24.828 --> 01:20:26.369 line:82%
Pick up the phone!

1328
01:20:30.411 --> 01:20:32.286 line:82%
Saravana, answer it!

1329
01:20:37.078 --> 01:20:38.619 line:82%
Hey! She’s here!

1330
01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:42.619 line:82%
Catch her!

1331
01:20:45.119 --> 01:20:46.869 line:82%
Don’t let her escape.
We’ll be in trouble.

1332
01:20:52.244 --> 01:20:53.703 line:82%
-Look there!
-Okay.

1333
01:21:03.911 --> 01:21:05.078 line:82%
Search everywhere!

1334
01:22:55.828 --> 01:22:56.828 line:82%
Get her!

1335
01:22:59.078 --> 01:23:00.078 line:82%
Come on.

1336
01:23:08.994 --> 01:23:09.994 line:82%
What happened?

1337
01:23:12.744 --> 01:23:14.244 line:82%
Hey, go, get her!

1338
01:23:25.286 --> 01:23:26.286 line:82%
You're dead.

1339
01:23:51.703 --> 01:23:52.703 line:82%
Die!

1340
01:23:53.953 --> 01:23:54.953 line:82%
Die!

1341
01:24:03.619 --> 01:24:04.619 line:82%
Brother!

1342
01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:10.911 line:82%
Brother!

1343
01:24:10.953 --> 01:24:12.494 line:82%
Stop! Someone's calling.

1344
01:24:12.744 --> 01:24:13.994 line:82%
Who just called us?

1345
01:24:14.911 --> 01:24:16.619 line:82%
Me!
How do I reach the main road?

1346
01:24:16.661 --> 01:24:18.994 line:82%
Head east. You’ll find it.

1347
01:24:19.036 --> 01:24:20.036 line:82%
Great!

1348
01:24:20.161 --> 01:24:21.161 line:82%
Thanks a lot.

1349
01:24:21.203 --> 01:24:23.453 line:82%
Alright, brother. Let's go!

1350
01:24:38.369 --> 01:24:41.744 line:82%
Just today, I found out I’m pregnant.

1351
01:24:43.286 --> 01:24:44.786 line:82%
It’s my wedding day,

1352
01:24:45.953 --> 01:24:50.536 line:82%
and I’ve been waiting so
eagerly to tell my husband.

1353
01:24:53.786 --> 01:24:54.786 line:82%
Brother...

1354
01:24:55.578 --> 01:24:56.578 line:82%
Brother...

1355
01:24:56.703 --> 01:25:00.453 line:82%
I didn’t just call you that.
I meant it.

1356
01:25:01.161 --> 01:25:04.286 line:82%
As a sister, I beg you.

1357
01:25:07.119 --> 01:25:08.786 line:82%
If not for me,

1358
01:25:10.369 --> 01:25:14.078 line:82%
at least for the sake of my unborn child…
please let me go, brother.

1359
01:25:14.786 --> 01:25:15.786 line:82%
Please!

1360
01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:24.786 line:82%
Why, brother?

1361
01:25:54.161 --> 01:25:58.411 line:82%
They staged a dead body to look
like Mudiarasan, burned it,

1362
01:25:58.494 --> 01:26:00.536 line:82%
and made it seem like he was dead.

1363
01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:07.536 line:82%
Brother!

1364
01:26:07.578 --> 01:26:08.869 line:82%
That's his watch!

1365
01:26:08.953 --> 01:26:10.203 line:82%
That's our brother, sir.

1366
01:26:10.744 --> 01:26:13.161 line:82%
Madhavi’s body was destroyed
without a trace,

1367
01:26:13.994 --> 01:26:15.578 line:82%
and her ashes were dispersed.

1368
01:26:18.161 --> 01:26:20.953 line:82%
In the end,
they convinced the minister

1369
01:26:20.994 --> 01:26:23.828 line:82%
that Madhavi had killed Mudiarasan
and escaped with the money.

1370
01:26:23.953 --> 01:26:25.869 line:82%
-You raised as your own daughter!
-Our brother is gone!

1371
01:26:25.911 --> 01:26:28.119 line:82%
-She stole your money, sir!
-We have no one now.

1372
01:26:28.203 --> 01:26:29.869 line:82%
We are orphans now, sir.

1373
01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:33.203 line:82%
We’re crying just hearing your story.

1374
01:26:34.036 --> 01:26:35.828 line:82%
How do you say it
without shedding a tear?

1375
01:26:37.328 --> 01:26:39.119 line:82%
My sufferings in jail...

1376
01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:40.869 line:82%
have hardened me.

1377
01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:41.911 line:82%
Jail?

1378
01:26:41.953 --> 01:26:42.953 line:82%
Yes.

1379
01:26:43.328 --> 01:26:46.286 line:82%
That evening, I was waiting for
Madhavi at the temple.

1380
01:26:46.744 --> 01:26:49.661 line:82%
Meanwhile, the minister
misinterpreted her message to me.

1381
01:26:49.869 --> 01:26:52.494 line:82%
He mistook her special gift
to me as the money.

1382
01:26:52.994 --> 01:26:54.244 line:82%
And had me arrested.

1383
01:26:55.036 --> 01:26:57.994 line:82%
He thought we had planned this together

1384
01:26:58.536 --> 01:27:00.578 line:82%
and tortured me for
the money’s whereabouts.

1385
01:27:03.911 --> 01:27:05.619 line:82%
I know Madhavi, sir.

1386
01:27:06.078 --> 01:27:07.286 line:82%
She would never do this!

1387
01:27:07.411 --> 01:27:08.703 line:82%
-Something else must have happened--
-Hey!

1388
01:27:08.744 --> 01:27:10.578 line:82%
She took the money as per your plan.

1389
01:27:10.661 --> 01:27:14.203 line:82%
We caught you before
you could both escape!

1390
01:27:14.286 --> 01:27:15.078 line:82%
Where is she?

1391
01:27:15.161 --> 01:27:16.619 line:82%
Sir, I swear she didn't--

1392
01:27:18.911 --> 01:27:20.328 line:82%
Where the hell is she?!

1393
01:27:20.703 --> 01:27:23.994 line:82%
Meanwhile, the minister
believed Mudiarasan...

1394
01:27:24.078 --> 01:27:26.078 line:82%
had sacrificed himself to
protect the money.

1395
01:27:26.161 --> 01:27:28.328 line:82%
He made his brothers Union Chairman,

1396
01:27:28.536 --> 01:27:31.411 line:82%
a Co-operative Society President,
a School Correspondent,

1397
01:27:31.494 --> 01:27:33.703 line:82%
and even giving them a factory,
out of gratitude.

1398
01:27:34.494 --> 01:27:36.369 line:82%
I couldn't do much for him,

1399
01:27:36.869 --> 01:27:38.244 line:82%
so in his name,

1400
01:27:39.703 --> 01:27:41.078 line:82%
I’ll give everything to you both.

1401
01:27:41.119 --> 01:27:45.036 line:82%
After three years in jail,
a kind man helped me get out.

1402
01:27:45.286 --> 01:27:48.453 line:82%
Bit by bit,
I pieced everything together.

1403
01:27:48.661 --> 01:27:49.661 line:82%
We get it.

1404
01:27:49.994 --> 01:27:53.328 line:82%
So, you lured him out of hiding
just to kill him for revenge.

1405
01:27:54.536 --> 01:27:56.119 line:82%
-Am I right?
-Nope.

1406
01:27:56.994 --> 01:27:58.286 line:82%
Death is freedom.

1407
01:27:59.078 --> 01:28:00.369 line:82%
It takes just a second.

1408
01:28:00.411 --> 01:28:01.744 line:82%
I want to punish him.

1409
01:28:01.994 --> 01:28:04.286 line:82%
He killed my wife, ruined my life,
and made me suffer

1410
01:28:04.328 --> 01:28:05.703 line:82%
for the money, right?

1411
01:28:06.078 --> 01:28:08.786 line:82%
He should suffer a hundred times
more than I did.

1412
01:28:09.203 --> 01:28:12.203 line:82%
The money he’s been hiding for,

1413
01:28:12.411 --> 01:28:14.578 line:82%
I’m going to steal that
hundred crores from him.

1414
01:28:14.619 --> 01:28:15.661 line:82%
That’s enough!

1415
01:28:15.744 --> 01:28:18.911 line:82%
We’re already in enough trouble.
We can’t do this.

1416
01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:22.536 line:82%
If you help me, you can split
the entire money among yourselves.

1417
01:28:22.578 --> 01:28:23.536 line:82%
What?!

1418
01:28:23.828 --> 01:28:24.828 line:82%
Seriously?

1419
01:28:24.911 --> 01:28:26.453 line:82%
That’s 20 crores each!

1420
01:28:26.536 --> 01:28:28.036 line:82%
What are you saying?

1421
01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.161 line:82%
If I’m getting crores,

1422
01:28:30.244 --> 01:28:33.036 line:82%
I’m fine with doing
clownery and buffoonery.

1423
01:28:33.369 --> 01:28:34.786 line:82%
Let’s start the game.

1424
01:28:37.911 --> 01:28:40.869 line:82%
Someone with a covered face hit you.

1425
01:28:41.244 --> 01:28:43.328 line:82%
Another guy in a costume hit him.

1426
01:28:44.078 --> 01:28:46.036 line:82%
And we still don’t know
who attacked my son.

1427
01:28:47.036 --> 01:28:48.369 line:82%
Something’s off.

1428
01:28:49.328 --> 01:28:51.619 line:82%
If anyone wanted to come after us,

1429
01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:53.994 line:82%
it would be ex-MLA Ezhumalai,

1430
01:28:54.161 --> 01:28:56.828 line:82%
the liquor factory owner we ousted

1431
01:28:56.994 --> 01:28:57.994 line:82%
or that estate guy.

1432
01:28:58.078 --> 01:29:00.036 line:82%
One of them must’ve hired someone.

1433
01:29:00.203 --> 01:29:02.828 line:82%
We’re questioning everyone.
Don’t stress.

1434
01:29:08.828 --> 01:29:10.078 line:82%
I’m not in this for the money.

1435
01:29:10.369 --> 01:29:12.661 line:82%
I’ll stand with you for justice.

1436
01:29:17.369 --> 01:29:19.078 line:82%
The who doesn’t matter…

1437
01:29:19.786 --> 01:29:21.994 line:82%
as much as the why.

1438
01:29:23.619 --> 01:29:26.244 line:82%
A man who fights you face-to-face
is an enemy.

1439
01:29:27.703 --> 01:29:30.411 line:82%
A man who stabs you in the back
is a traitor.

1440
01:29:32.078 --> 01:29:33.286 line:82%
But this one isn't either.

1441
01:29:35.744 --> 01:29:38.203 line:82%
The brothers knew using the stolen
money would expose them,

1442
01:29:38.619 --> 01:29:40.661 line:82%
so they’ve kept it untouched
for three years.

1443
01:29:41.078 --> 01:29:45.661 line:82%
To hide 100 crores, they need a
huge, specially designed locker.

1444
01:29:46.161 --> 01:29:49.786 line:82%
Only two companies in India make those.

1445
01:29:50.453 --> 01:29:51.703 line:82%
When I checked,

1446
01:29:52.078 --> 01:29:57.328 line:82%
I found out one of them delivered
such a locker to this town.

1447
01:29:57.453 --> 01:29:59.994 line:82%
After I arrived,
I searched their house,

1448
01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:03.494 line:82%
their theater, their factory.

1449
01:30:03.661 --> 01:30:05.328 line:82%
But I couldn't find it.

1450
01:30:05.911 --> 01:30:08.036 line:82%
They split the locker key into three parts,

1451
01:30:08.161 --> 01:30:09.744 line:82%
with each brother holding one.

1452
01:30:10.119 --> 01:30:12.953 line:82%
We lost the keys in the fight, brother.
We’re looking for it.

1453
01:30:13.036 --> 01:30:15.869 line:82%
We've asked the locker company
to send someone to make a duplicate.

1454
01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:20.328 line:82%
Did you lose the key in the fight,
or was the fight for the key?

1455
01:30:21.369 --> 01:30:25.161 line:82%
I fought the brothers and took
two parts of the key from them.

1456
01:30:27.578 --> 01:30:30.453 line:82%
To get the third, I needed
Mudiarasu to resurface.

1457
01:30:30.911 --> 01:30:32.411 line:82%
But I didn't know where he was.

1458
01:30:33.119 --> 01:30:35.244 line:82%
I thought beating up his brothers
would lure him out.

1459
01:30:35.453 --> 01:30:36.453 line:82%
He didn’t show.

1460
01:30:36.869 --> 01:30:40.953 line:82%
When I punished his son,
his love forced him out of hiding.

1461
01:30:42.286 --> 01:30:45.328 line:82%
There’s a link between
all these incidents.

1462
01:30:46.286 --> 01:30:48.703 line:82%
Find that, and we’ll find him.

1463
01:30:49.161 --> 01:30:52.661 line:82%
You’re chasing the wrong lead.

1464
01:30:53.411 --> 01:30:55.161 line:82%
He's planned meticulously

1465
01:30:55.911 --> 01:30:57.744 line:82%
and he's closing in without haste.

1466
01:30:58.411 --> 01:31:03.119 line:82%
Now, we need the last key and
the locker’s location.

1467
01:31:05.536 --> 01:31:06.911 line:82%
I need your help for that.

1468
01:31:07.078 --> 01:31:10.661 line:82%
They killed your wife to steal that money
when it wasn’t even theirs

1469
01:31:10.828 --> 01:31:12.244 line:82%
Now it is theirs.

1470
01:31:12.286 --> 01:31:13.453 line:82%
They’ll be worse than cruel.

1471
01:31:13.494 --> 01:31:16.244 line:82%
If we screw up, they’ll make us
regret we ever lived.

1472
01:31:16.994 --> 01:31:19.494 line:82%
The wind doesn’t always blow
in the same direction.

1473
01:31:19.828 --> 01:31:22.619 line:82%
If we plan it right,
we can outsmart them.

1474
01:31:22.744 --> 01:31:26.244 line:82%
For this, we need one of their own.
Someone who knows them inside out.

1475
01:31:28.536 --> 01:31:29.536 line:82%
There is one.

1476
01:31:29.578 --> 01:31:31.744 line:82%
Yes! He was my partner once.

1477
01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:34.661 line:82%
He lost everything to them in debt
because he was a drunkard

1478
01:31:34.744 --> 01:31:36.119 line:82%
and ended up as their henchman.

1479
01:31:36.703 --> 01:31:38.328 line:82%
If he drinks, he spills everything.

1480
01:31:38.494 --> 01:31:42.161 line:82%
-Then let’s get him drunk.
-Won’t work. He quit after joining them.

1481
01:31:42.286 --> 01:31:46.078 line:82%
A drunkard quitting booze is
like a cat ignoring fish.

1482
01:31:46.619 --> 01:31:48.786 line:82%
Just put it in front of him,
and instinct takes over.

1483
01:31:49.369 --> 01:31:52.453 line:82%
-You said he was in costume?
-Yes, brother.

1484
01:31:56.828 --> 01:32:00.786 line:82%
Check where he could’ve bought it.

1485
01:32:00.953 --> 01:32:01.578 line:82%
Okay.

1486
01:32:01.661 --> 01:32:07.744 line:82%
A hidden tiger is more dangerous
than one that attacks openly.

1487
01:32:07.953 --> 01:32:11.286 line:82%
You can never predict its move.

1488
01:32:11.953 --> 01:32:14.078 line:82%
From now on,
we’re all Gangers.

1489
01:32:14.119 --> 01:32:15.119 line:82%
Gangers?

1490
01:32:15.369 --> 01:32:17.036 line:82%
Isn’t Gangster the actual word?

1491
01:32:17.078 --> 01:32:18.286 line:82%
Yeah, but that’s old.

1492
01:32:18.369 --> 01:32:19.703 line:82%
We’ll make our own.

1493
01:32:19.786 --> 01:32:21.494 line:82%
Say it with pride!

1494
01:32:22.119 --> 01:32:23.119 line:82%
Gangers!

1495
01:32:24.911 --> 01:32:25.911 line:82%
Gangers!

1496
01:32:27.286 --> 01:32:28.828 line:82%
We are Gangers!

1497
01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:39.286 line:82%
Stop.

1498
01:32:40.119 --> 01:32:41.286 line:82%
Stop the bike.

1499
01:32:44.578 --> 01:32:45.661 line:82%
Blow into this.

1500
01:32:45.703 --> 01:32:47.578 line:82%
Sir, I don’t drink.
I quit three years ago.

1501
01:32:47.619 --> 01:32:49.744 line:82%
Let the machine decide. Blow.

1502
01:32:51.369 --> 01:32:52.369 line:82%
See?
Nothing. Happy?

1503
01:32:52.411 --> 01:32:54.119 line:82%
- Now, suck on it.
- …Suck?

1504
01:32:54.369 --> 01:32:56.244 line:82%
It's the new law.

1505
01:32:56.411 --> 01:32:58.328 line:82%
You have to blow and suck.
Go on.

1506
01:32:58.536 --> 01:32:59.536 line:82%
Seriously?

1507
01:33:01.328 --> 01:33:02.536 line:82%
Not like that!

1508
01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:04.619 line:82%
Do it like a cow drinking water.

1509
01:33:06.453 --> 01:33:07.786 line:82%
Like that. Do it!

1510
01:33:12.494 --> 01:33:13.494 line:82%
Sir!

1511
01:33:13.536 --> 01:33:14.536 line:82%
Sir, there’s alcohol in this!

1512
01:33:14.578 --> 01:33:15.994 line:82%
You’re the drunk one,
and you’re questioning me?

1513
01:33:16.078 --> 01:33:18.369 line:82%
No, I swear I didn’t drink!
Wait… did I? I don’t know!

1514
01:33:18.453 --> 01:33:20.453 line:82%
-See? You’re already blabbering.
-I didn’t do it on purpose!

1515
01:33:20.453 --> 01:33:23.536 line:82%
Voluntary or not, I don’t care.

1516
01:33:23.619 --> 01:33:25.494 line:82%
Neither does the machine.
Come, let's go to the station.

1517
01:33:25.536 --> 01:33:27.411 line:82%
Sir, sir! Wait.

1518
01:33:27.869 --> 01:33:29.119 line:82%
-Here, take this.
-What?

1519
01:33:29.161 --> 01:33:31.286 line:82%
Hey! Don’t bribe me in public, you idiot!

1520
01:33:31.369 --> 01:33:32.994 line:82%
There are CCTV cameras!

1521
01:33:33.036 --> 01:33:34.036 line:82%
In this town?

1522
01:33:34.453 --> 01:33:36.369 line:82%
Don’t look up! My seniors
might be watching!

1523
01:33:36.453 --> 01:33:37.578 line:82%
What do I do?

1524
01:33:37.911 --> 01:33:39.119 line:82%
See that bar?

1525
01:33:39.161 --> 01:33:42.497 line:82%
Find a guy named Bar Pandi
and give it to him.

1526
01:33:42.536 --> 01:33:43.536 line:82%
In the bar?

1527
01:33:44.244 --> 01:33:46.703 line:82%
Yes. Or I’ll take your license. Go!

1528
01:33:50.453 --> 01:33:51.953 line:82%
He’s tasted alcohol.

1529
01:33:52.161 --> 01:33:53.869 line:82%
Now he’ll want more.

1530
01:33:54.411 --> 01:33:55.411 line:82%
Cheers!

1531
01:33:57.828 --> 01:33:59.536 line:82%
Mission is possible!

1532
01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:04.786 line:82%
-Bro, who’s Pandi here?
-He’ll come. Wait.

1533
01:34:08.744 --> 01:34:09.744 line:82%
You go now.

1534
01:34:12.328 --> 01:34:14.119 line:82%
-Can you open this?
-Me?

1535
01:34:15.453 --> 01:34:17.161 line:82%
If he opens it,
the job’s done.

1536
01:34:21.203 --> 01:34:22.203 line:82%
Hello!

1537
01:34:25.328 --> 01:34:26.661 line:82%
He’s opening it!

1538
01:34:29.286 --> 01:34:31.161 line:82%
If he licks his fingers,
he’s already craving more.

1539
01:34:32.494 --> 01:34:33.869 line:82%
He did it!

1540
01:34:40.828 --> 01:34:43.161 line:82%
Sorry! Don't mistake me.
I got too excited.

1541
01:34:43.203 --> 01:34:45.578 line:82%
Bro, the cap’s stuck. Can you open it?

1542
01:34:45.661 --> 01:34:46.786 line:82%

I have no other choice!

the three do you want me to kill?

-Locker?

1631
01:40:16.828 --> 01:40:18.036 line:82%
I have no clue about that.

1632
01:40:18.119 --> 01:40:19.411 line:82%

1633
01:40:19.494 --> 01:40:21.869 line:82%

to get you here, and you don’t know?

1634
01:40:21.994 --> 01:40:24.161 line:82%
Alright, leave.
We’ll split your share.

1635
01:40:24.203 --> 01:40:26.953 line:82%
Bro, bro! You’re cutting me off?

1636
01:40:26.953 --> 01:40:28.453 line:82%
Because you’re useless to us!

1637
01:40:28.494 --> 01:40:30.953 line:82%
Some guy named Charles is coming
from Bombay about the locker.

1638
01:40:32.036 --> 01:40:33.369 line:82%
Not just that.

1639
01:40:34.119 --> 01:40:36.286 line:82%
I’m the one picking him up
from the airport today.

1640
01:40:36.744 --> 01:40:39.203 line:82%
Oh? Have you seen him before?

1641
01:40:39.661 --> 01:40:41.911 line:82%
Not just me, even my boss
has never seen him.

1642
01:40:41.994 --> 01:40:43.369 line:82%
He’s from that locker company in Bombay.

1643
01:40:43.786 --> 01:40:46.203 line:82%
So, whatever you show him is
Mudiarasan’s house?

1644
01:40:46.536 --> 01:40:48.453 line:82%
Do something.
Bring him here.

1645
01:40:49.161 --> 01:40:50.078 line:82%
Okay.

1646
01:40:50.828 --> 01:40:51.828 line:82%

-What?

1647
01:40:51.911 --> 01:40:53.036 line:82%
Can I get an advance?

1648
01:40:53.453 --> 01:40:56.578 line:82%
We haven’t even stolen the money yet,
and you’re asking for an advance?

1649
01:40:56.661 --> 01:40:57.661 line:82%
-Get lost!
-Leave.

1650
01:40:57.703 --> 01:40:59.078 line:82%
Just do your job first!

1651
01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:01.661 line:82%
Don’t bring in a new partner
every damn time.

1652
01:41:01.703 --> 01:41:02.786 line:82%
We’re losing shares here!

1653
01:41:02.828 --> 01:41:04.994 line:82%

they’re playing the stock market!

1654
01:41:19.911 --> 01:41:21.869 line:82%
-This house?
-Yes.

1655
01:41:22.578 --> 01:41:23.953 line:82%
Small house.

1656
01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:25.411 line:82%
Big money!

1657
01:41:29.494 --> 01:41:30.786 line:82%
-What is this?
-Leveler.

1658
01:41:30.911 --> 01:41:32.703 line:82%
-And this?
-A measurer.

1659
01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:34.786 line:82%
-What about this?
-A key set.

1660
01:41:35.161 --> 01:41:36.411 line:82%
Why are you tying me up?

1661
01:41:36.453 --> 01:41:38.453 line:82%
They are waiting for me at
Mudiarasan's house.

1662
01:41:38.536 --> 01:41:41.203 line:82%
Don't worry.
Charles will be there on time.

1663
01:41:41.244 --> 01:41:42.828 line:82%
But I'm here. How's that possible?

1664
01:41:42.911 --> 01:41:43.828 line:82%
Like this.

1665
01:41:46.578 --> 01:41:47.536 line:82%
How is it?

1666
01:41:50.869 --> 01:41:51.994 line:82%
Yuck!

1667
01:41:52.328 --> 01:41:54.036 line:82%
I’m not that bad-looking!

1668
01:41:54.828 --> 01:41:55.828 line:82%
Hey!

1669
01:41:55.953 --> 01:41:58.536 line:82%
You look like a soft dough ball,
and you’re calling me bad?

1670
01:41:58.661 --> 01:42:00.328 line:82%
I’ll knock your nose off!

1671
01:42:00.411 --> 01:42:02.578 line:82%
-Give me your glass!
-I think he's gonna get caught.

1672
01:42:02.828 --> 01:42:05.286 line:82%
Hey! You just look innocent.

1673
01:42:05.703 --> 01:42:07.161 line:82%
But I can hear your bad thoughts.

1674
01:42:07.578 --> 01:42:10.786 line:82%
This guy knows nothing, yet
he gets the same 20 crores as me?

1675
01:42:10.911 --> 01:42:13.578 line:82%
-Give me a couple more.
-Of course, take it.

1676
01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:15.744 line:82%
Wow, he's so generous.

1677
01:42:15.828 --> 01:42:17.036 line:82%
Is it his own money?

1678
01:42:17.078 --> 01:42:18.703 line:82%
He’s being generous
with someone else’s! Shut up.

1679
01:42:18.744 --> 01:42:21.161 line:82%
-Alright, it's time. Leave.
-Okay, then.

1680
01:42:21.453 --> 01:42:23.203 line:82%
The box!

1681
01:42:23.286 --> 01:42:26.286 line:82%
You dressed up like me, but you're
leaving the toolbox behind?

1682
01:42:26.328 --> 01:42:28.078 line:82%
Alright, alright! Don’t cry!

1683
01:42:28.119 --> 01:42:29.328 line:82%
Let it go.

1684
01:42:30.203 --> 01:42:31.203 line:82%
Charles.

1685
01:42:32.369 --> 01:42:33.369 line:82%
Charles.

1686
01:42:34.328 --> 01:42:35.786 line:82%
-Idiot Singaram!
-I told you!

1687
01:42:36.036 --> 01:42:38.494 line:82%
Why are you calling me an idiot?

1688
01:42:38.578 --> 01:42:40.744 line:82%
I’m calling you Charles,
and you’re just walking away!

1689
01:42:40.786 --> 01:42:42.328 line:82%
How the hell will this plan work, then?

1690
01:42:42.828 --> 01:42:44.953 line:82%
From the dawn of time,

1691
01:42:45.203 --> 01:42:47.494 line:82%
no child turns to their name the
moment they’re named.

1692
01:42:47.744 --> 01:42:49.286 line:82%
It takes at least a year.

1693
01:42:49.453 --> 01:42:51.244 line:82%
You just named me a minute ago,

1694
01:42:51.328 --> 01:42:53.869 line:82%
and you expect me to respond instantly?
How does that make sense?

1695
01:42:53.911 --> 01:42:56.411 line:82%
Charles, listen.
Mudiarasan is dangerous.

1696
01:42:56.494 --> 01:42:58.828 line:82%
One small mistake,
and you’re dead.

1697
01:42:59.369 --> 01:43:01.578 line:82%
Be Charles. Don’t be careless.

1698
01:43:01.828 --> 01:43:02.953 line:82%
Amal, take him.

1699
01:43:03.869 --> 01:43:04.703 line:82%
Oh, my!

1700
01:43:04.786 --> 01:43:05.786 line:82%
Let’s go? Come.

1701
01:43:05.869 --> 01:43:08.453 line:82%
Feels like a JCB is carrying me.

1702
01:43:14.578 --> 01:43:15.578 line:82%
Maths, sir!

1703
01:43:15.661 --> 01:43:16.994 line:82%
Excuse me, is the Maths teacher here?

1704
01:43:18.369 --> 01:43:19.369 line:82%
What is it?

1705
01:43:19.453 --> 01:43:21.328 line:82%
Malaiarsan asked me to get you.

1706
01:43:21.411 --> 01:43:22.578 line:82%
Oh god, I’m done for.

1707
01:43:22.744 --> 01:43:24.286 line:82%
Why are they calling me? I’m scared.

1708
01:43:24.328 --> 01:43:26.536 line:82%
For them, you’re just a Maths teacher.

1709
01:43:26.744 --> 01:43:28.536 line:82%
It must be about his son’s studies.

1710
01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:30.119 line:82%
-Don’t be scared.
-Yeah, that must be it.

1711
01:43:30.244 --> 01:43:32.244 line:82%
Listen, Singaram is already in
that house as Charles.

1712
01:43:32.369 --> 01:43:34.911 line:82%
Don’t act like you know him
and ruin the plan. Got it?

1713
01:43:34.994 --> 01:43:37.286 line:82%
Teacher! Are you coming or not?
How long?!

1714
01:43:37.369 --> 01:43:39.119 line:82%
He’s coming, he’s coming!

1715
01:43:41.994 --> 01:43:42.994 line:82%
Keep walking.

1716
01:43:47.078 --> 01:43:49.286 line:82%
If you screw up, it’s not just you,
they’ll kill me too

1717
01:43:49.328 --> 01:43:50.703 line:82%
and turn us into minced meat.

1718
01:43:50.744 --> 01:43:51.994 line:82%
Now tell me, what’s your name?

1719
01:43:53.328 --> 01:43:54.328 line:82%
Charles.

1720
01:43:54.453 --> 01:43:55.786 line:82%
Good. Burn it into your brain!

1721
01:43:56.203 --> 01:43:57.744 line:82%
I don’t think he’s working alone.

1722
01:43:57.869 --> 01:43:59.369 line:82%
He’s got a whole gang behind him.

1723
01:43:59.453 --> 01:44:02.328 line:82%
Once I catch him,
I’m cutting off his head!

1724
01:44:08.078 --> 01:44:10.744 line:82%
To escape the fox, I’ve run straight
into the lion’s den.

1725
01:44:10.994 --> 01:44:12.828 line:82%
Sir, this is Charles.

1726
01:44:23.536 --> 01:44:24.828 line:82%
Your hands look young,

1727
01:44:25.828 --> 01:44:27.578 line:82%
but your face looks old?

1728
01:44:27.786 --> 01:44:28.786 line:82%
Oh that?

1729
01:44:28.953 --> 01:44:30.828 line:82%
I do lower-neck yoga.

1730
01:44:37.369 --> 01:44:39.161 line:82%
-Please, have some.
-Okay, sir.

1731
01:44:39.703 --> 01:44:40.703 line:82%
We can do that.

1732
01:44:40.828 --> 01:44:42.328 line:82%
Brother, who’s this?

1733
01:44:42.411 --> 01:44:43.994 line:82%
He’s from Bombay to fix the locker.

1734
01:44:44.453 --> 01:44:46.286 line:82%
The inspector’s on the line. Here.

1735
01:44:46.786 --> 01:44:49.994 line:82%
Kottai, don’t get careless
just because we caught him.

1736
01:44:50.453 --> 01:44:53.494 line:82%
If anything feels off, we’ll kill him.

1737
01:44:54.286 --> 01:44:56.994 line:82%
Brother, now we know who’s behind this.
Don’t worry, we can handle it.

1738
01:44:57.119 --> 01:44:59.411 line:82%
We should find the
connection between them.

1739
01:45:00.786 --> 01:45:03.203 line:82%
Mouth organ? I didn’t bring one.

1740
01:45:03.911 --> 01:45:05.161 line:82%
Your moustache!

1741
01:45:06.119 --> 01:45:07.119 line:82%
Moustache?!

1742
01:45:08.286 --> 01:45:10.036 line:82%
Damn! It’s inside the cup!

1743
01:45:10.244 --> 01:45:12.661 line:82%
Get that scoundrel right before me!

1744
01:45:13.203 --> 01:45:15.161 line:82%
Yes, give me two more days.

1745
01:45:15.911 --> 01:45:17.203 line:82%
Hey, what happened?

1746
01:45:17.286 --> 01:45:20.036 line:82%
Ever since I flew in from Bombay,
I’ve been feeling sick.

1747
01:45:20.119 --> 01:45:21.661 line:82%
Must be jet lag… or cholera.

1748
01:45:21.786 --> 01:45:22.786 line:82%
She took the cup!

1749
01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:29.369 line:82%
Hey! I told you to throw out
that expired tea!

1750
01:45:29.453 --> 01:45:30.994 line:82%
Did you use it?

1751
01:45:31.119 --> 01:45:32.744 line:82%
Oh, damn. Yeah, I did.

1752
01:45:32.828 --> 01:45:34.828 line:82%
My mistake. What to do now?

1753
01:45:34.994 --> 01:45:36.703 line:82%
He’s an outsider.
Doesn’t matter.

1754
01:45:36.953 --> 01:45:38.286 line:82%
Expired tea?!

1755
01:45:38.911 --> 01:45:41.078 line:82%
Damn, you witches!

1756
01:45:41.619 --> 01:45:43.453 line:82%
They are so causal about it?!

1757
01:45:43.828 --> 01:45:45.911 line:82%
Even the women in this house
are criminals.

1758
01:45:46.036 --> 01:45:47.494 line:82%
Good thing my immunity is strong.

1759
01:45:47.661 --> 01:45:48.494 line:82%
Sir!

1760
01:45:49.619 --> 01:45:51.328 line:82%
The Maths teacher is here.

1761
01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:52.703 line:82%
Welcome, Maths teacher.

1762
01:45:53.078 --> 01:45:54.119 line:82%
Greetings, sir.

1763
01:45:54.328 --> 01:45:55.328 line:82%
Greetings.

1764
01:45:55.744 --> 01:45:56.744 line:82%
Greetings.

1765
01:45:57.703 --> 01:45:59.203 line:82%
Greetings, Singaram.

1766
01:46:00.869 --> 01:46:01.869 line:82%
Singaram?!

1767
01:46:03.994 --> 01:46:04.994 line:82%
I screwed up.

1768
01:46:05.078 --> 01:46:09.536 line:82%
This big-eyed fool exposed me in seconds!

1769
01:46:09.661 --> 01:46:11.453 line:82%
Can you move, sir?

1770
01:46:12.619 --> 01:46:14.411 line:82%
All praise to Lord Singaravelan!

1771
01:46:15.328 --> 01:46:16.411 line:82%
He matched it.

1772
01:46:16.786 --> 01:46:18.369 line:82%
Sir, the teacher is praying.

1773
01:46:19.036 --> 01:46:20.161 line:82%
What, Charles? Feeling better now?

1774
01:46:20.161 --> 01:46:22.161 line:82%
Yes, yes.
Everything’s wonderful.

1775
01:46:22.994 --> 01:46:25.161 line:82%
Listen, Singaram is already in
that house as Charles.

1776
01:46:25.244 --> 01:46:27.203 line:82%
Don’t act like you know him
and ruin the plan. Got it?

1777
01:46:27.661 --> 01:46:29.119 line:82%
Who’s this?

1778
01:46:30.036 --> 01:46:31.453 line:82%
I’ve never seen him before.

1779
01:46:31.661 --> 01:46:32.911 line:82%
But you’ve seen me before?

1780
01:46:43.161 --> 01:46:44.161 line:82%
No, sir.

1781
01:46:44.536 --> 01:46:46.078 line:82%
Then why ask about him specifically?

1782
01:46:46.828 --> 01:46:47.828 line:82%
That’s because…

1783
01:46:48.494 --> 01:46:51.703 line:82%
You look brave like a cop...

1784
01:46:52.661 --> 01:46:54.203 line:82%
but you're shaking with fear!

1785
01:46:55.494 --> 01:46:58.078 line:82%
-Sorry, sorry!
-You should be more careful! Idiot!

1786
01:46:58.203 --> 01:46:59.703 line:82%
Are you okay?

1787
01:47:00.119 --> 01:47:01.161 line:82%
Why would you, you moron?!

1788
01:47:01.244 --> 01:47:04.078 line:82%
Hey, why are you looking at me?
Look there!

1789
01:47:04.203 --> 01:47:05.203 line:82%
Should I slap him?

1790
01:47:05.536 --> 01:47:09.661 line:82%
Slap them?
Don’t screw up the plan.

1791
01:47:11.036 --> 01:47:13.494 line:82%
I’ll kill you before that!
Stop! Down!

1792
01:47:13.578 --> 01:47:15.453 line:82%
-Down?
-Put down your head.

1793
01:47:16.119 --> 01:47:17.661 line:82%
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Get lost!

1794
01:47:17.744 --> 01:47:18.953 line:82%
To hell with your massage!

1795
01:47:19.036 --> 01:47:22.119 line:82%
Teacher, do you know why
we called you here?

1796
01:47:22.203 --> 01:47:23.244 line:82%
I know, sir.

1797
01:47:23.286 --> 01:47:25.411 line:82%
It’s about your son’s studies.

1798
01:47:25.578 --> 01:47:27.744 line:82%
I even gave him extra marks
on his last exam.

1799
01:47:28.661 --> 01:47:30.119 line:82%
He’ll become a great scientist--

1800
01:47:30.161 --> 01:47:32.911 line:82%
Hey! Drop the act.
You think we’re fools?

1801
01:47:33.119 --> 01:47:35.161 line:82%
We know who you are and
why you’re here!

1802
01:47:36.619 --> 01:47:38.286 line:82%
-Look at this picture.
-He’s the cop?

1803
01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:42.119 line:82%
Yes, I checked. He’s the one
pretending to be a teacher.

1804
01:47:44.203 --> 01:47:46.953 line:82%
Sir, I’ll tell you the truth.
Please forgive me.

1805
01:47:47.078 --> 01:47:48.619 line:82%
Damn, he surrendered?

1806
01:47:48.661 --> 01:47:50.994 line:82%
My teaching job is way more
peaceful than being a cop.

1807
01:47:51.078 --> 01:47:52.703 line:82%
I even studied formulas for this!

1808
01:47:52.744 --> 01:47:54.244 line:82%
When the Commissioner asked for a report,

1809
01:47:54.286 --> 01:47:56.828 line:82%
I sent him school progress
reports by mistake.

1810
01:47:56.869 --> 01:47:58.911 line:82%
He got pissed and suspended me.

1811
01:47:58.953 --> 01:48:00.536 line:82%
Now, this is all I have left.

1812
01:48:00.661 --> 01:48:04.244 line:82%
Oh god, is he gonna rat me out too?!

1813
01:48:04.619 --> 01:48:09.411 line:82%
If you have any info, sir,
I’ll submit it in my next report.

1814
01:48:09.494 --> 01:48:10.286 line:82%
Get lost!

1815
01:48:10.369 --> 01:48:11.369 line:82%
Sir?

1816
01:48:11.411 --> 01:48:13.578 line:82%
He’s telling you to leave. Just go!

1817
01:48:14.869 --> 01:48:15.869 line:82%
Wait!

1818
01:48:19.203 --> 01:48:20.911 line:82%
Will you tell people you saw me?

1819
01:48:21.161 --> 01:48:22.161 line:82%
Sir?!

1820
01:48:22.244 --> 01:48:25.119 line:82%
I made the world believe I’m dead.

1821
01:48:25.619 --> 01:48:27.411 line:82%
It won’t take much for me to kill you.

1822
01:48:28.661 --> 01:48:29.619 line:82%
I’ll spare you.

1823
01:48:29.828 --> 01:48:30.828 line:82%
Get out!

1824
01:48:32.619 --> 01:48:34.994 line:82%
I thought the cop would be brave,
but he’s worse.

1825
01:48:35.078 --> 01:48:36.661 line:82%
Alright, take Charles.

1826
01:48:36.703 --> 01:48:38.953 line:82%
-Yes, we have to go.
-Hey, get my shirt.

1827
01:48:39.036 --> 01:48:39.994 line:82%
Get the car.

1828
01:48:40.078 --> 01:48:41.494 line:82%
I’m gonna escape.
You should too.

1829
01:48:41.578 --> 01:48:44.286 line:82%
You leaving is my only chance
to survive this. Leave!

1830
01:48:44.494 --> 01:48:45.578 line:82%
Just go!

1831
01:48:55.869 --> 01:48:56.619 line:82%
Get down.

1832
01:48:56.744 --> 01:48:59.369 line:82%
Will you at least let me see
the locker while I work?

1833
01:48:59.536 --> 01:49:01.911 line:82%
We blindfolded you to keep the locker's
location a secret. Come on.

1834
01:49:10.703 --> 01:49:13.786 line:82%
-Why are there so many steps?
-Stop talking and just walk!

1835
01:49:14.744 --> 01:49:16.161 line:82%
Hey! All of you, leave!

1836
01:49:26.328 --> 01:49:27.369 line:82%
What happened?

1837
01:49:27.578 --> 01:49:29.369 line:82%
Only you touched it.
Why is the alarm blaring?

1838
01:49:29.453 --> 01:49:31.453 line:82%
Since my hand is wounded,
it's not being scanned.

1839
01:49:31.536 --> 01:49:32.536 line:82%
Move!

1840
01:49:46.244 --> 01:49:47.453 line:82%
Greetings, sir.

1841
01:49:48.536 --> 01:49:50.286 line:82%
A person from Bombay is here
to repair the locker.

1842
01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:03.578 line:82%
Go on. Straight.

1843
01:50:06.786 --> 01:50:08.911 line:82%
Stop turing around.

1844
01:50:10.286 --> 01:50:11.911 line:82%
Charles, when will the key be ready?

1845
01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:13.744 line:82%
-Two days.
-Two days?!

1846
01:50:13.828 --> 01:50:15.994 line:82%
Stop shouting! You think this
is a cycle key?

1847
01:50:16.119 --> 01:50:16.994 line:82%
It's for the locker.

1848
01:50:17.078 --> 01:50:18.661 line:82%
-First, show me the locker.
-It's right there.

1849
01:50:18.828 --> 01:50:20.619 line:82%
-Where?
-A little closer. Right there.

1850
01:50:22.411 --> 01:50:23.411 line:82%
Here?

1851
01:50:24.244 --> 01:50:25.786 line:82%
This locker’s key is
the one that’s missing.

1852
01:50:25.828 --> 01:50:26.744 line:82%
That’s what we need you to make.

1853
01:50:26.828 --> 01:50:29.703 line:82%
-Alright, now both of you turn around.
-Why?

1854
01:50:30.494 --> 01:50:32.369 line:82%
You blindfolded me to hide your secrets.

1855
01:50:32.453 --> 01:50:34.161 line:82%
This is my company’s secret.
Turn around.

1856
01:50:38.453 --> 01:50:40.036 line:82%
How am I supposed to
take measurements now?

1857
01:50:44.369 --> 01:50:46.703 line:82%
It’s pitch dark in there.

1858
01:50:49.119 --> 01:50:50.661 line:82%
I’ll use my finger.

1859
01:51:01.703 --> 01:51:02.703 line:82%
All good?

1860
01:51:03.203 --> 01:51:05.953 line:82%
Wait, I’m taking the measurement.

1861
01:51:08.869 --> 01:51:11.328 line:82%
Oh God! My finger’s stuck.

1862
01:51:11.536 --> 01:51:12.703 line:82%
All okay?

1863
01:51:13.119 --> 01:51:14.286 line:82%
Have patience, please.

1864
01:51:17.036 --> 01:51:18.203 line:82%
Damn, there’s blood.

1865
01:51:18.578 --> 01:51:21.994 line:82%
I should beat you with
a slipper, you idiot!

1866
01:51:22.119 --> 01:51:24.369 line:82%
Is this how you take measurements?

1867
01:51:24.494 --> 01:51:26.203 line:82%
My poor little finger.

1868
01:51:26.286 --> 01:51:27.411 line:82%
Is the job done?

1869
01:51:27.578 --> 01:51:29.161 line:82%
Okay!

1870
01:51:35.869 --> 01:51:40.078 line:82%
Hey! Did a six-foot man buy costumes
here during the festival?

1871
01:51:40.119 --> 01:51:41.661 line:82%
-Yeah, he did.
-Give me his phone number.

1872
01:51:41.703 --> 01:51:42.411 line:82%
I don't have it.

1873
01:51:42.411 --> 01:51:44.244 line:82%
How did you give him the costume
without a phone number?

1874
01:51:44.286 --> 01:51:46.411 line:82%
The costume costs 2,000,
but he paid 4,000.

1875
01:51:46.453 --> 01:51:48.369 line:82%
-It was a profit, so I didn’t mind.
-Hey!

1876
01:51:48.661 --> 01:51:51.036 line:82%
Hold on, hold on. An auto driver
brought him here.

1877
01:51:51.078 --> 01:51:52.536 line:82%
I know him well.

1878
01:51:53.078 --> 01:51:53.869 line:82%
He’s the one.

1879
01:51:53.953 --> 01:51:56.619 line:82%
Did a six-foot man come in your auto
to buy costumes from him?

1880
01:51:56.661 --> 01:51:57.328 line:82%
Yeah, he did.

1881
01:51:57.369 --> 01:51:59.036 line:82%
-Do you know where he is?
-No idea.

1882
01:51:59.411 --> 01:52:02.078 line:82%
Come with us. You can identify him
if you see him, right?

1883
01:52:06.828 --> 01:52:08.161 line:82%
He’s really smart.

1884
01:52:10.119 --> 01:52:14.369 line:82%
He built the locker behind
the theater screen

1885
01:52:14.494 --> 01:52:17.911 line:82%
and set up the screen and
back projection behind that perfectly.

1886
01:52:18.244 --> 01:52:23.078 line:82%
So, from anywhere inside the theater,
it looks just like a normal screen.

1887
01:52:23.244 --> 01:52:26.661 line:82%
No one will be able to figure out
there’s a locker hidden there.

1888
01:52:26.869 --> 01:52:29.119 line:82%
He was built like a gym guy, sir.

1889
01:52:29.161 --> 01:52:30.494 line:82%
He was fair and six feet tall, sir.

1890
01:52:30.578 --> 01:52:32.786 line:82%
That matches the guy who hit us.

1891
01:52:33.286 --> 01:52:34.828 line:82%
It’s the same guy behind it all.

1892
01:52:35.828 --> 01:52:39.036 line:82%
As Singaram said, if they don’t
get the key in two days

1893
01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:41.453 line:82%
they’ll figure it out and get alert.

1894
01:52:41.828 --> 01:52:43.786 line:82%
We need to
steal the money before that.

1895
01:52:44.036 --> 01:52:46.286 line:82%
Hello, Dad! They’re beating me up!

1896
01:52:47.661 --> 01:52:48.661 line:82%
Who?

1897
01:52:48.869 --> 01:52:50.453 line:82%
Dad…
It's my--

1898
01:52:52.619 --> 01:52:56.453 line:82%
In the end, Muthu was about
to say "It’s my..."

1899
01:52:56.786 --> 01:52:57.994 line:82%
What could that mean?

1900
01:52:58.078 --> 01:53:00.953 line:82%
Maybe he was trying to
say "my family" or "my friend."

1901
01:53:01.244 --> 01:53:04.703 line:82%
If that’s the case, he would’ve said "our"
when speaking to me, right?

1902
01:53:05.494 --> 01:53:07.619 line:82%
But if he’s saying "my," to me

1903
01:53:07.744 --> 01:53:13.369 line:82%
it means he was talking about
something that’s only connected to him.

1904
01:53:13.619 --> 01:53:15.119 line:82%
We need to find out what it is.

1905
01:53:15.203 --> 01:53:16.786 line:82%
Is that even possible?

1906
01:53:16.828 --> 01:53:18.203 line:82%
People usually steal when no one’s around.

1907
01:53:18.328 --> 01:53:20.536 line:82%
And you’re saying there’s
a new movie releasing,

1908
01:53:20.619 --> 01:53:22.203 line:82%
the temple festival is happening,

1909
01:53:22.286 --> 01:53:23.953 line:82%
the crowd will be massive.

1910
01:53:23.994 --> 01:53:25.703 line:82%
How can we take such a big risk?

1911
01:53:25.953 --> 01:53:27.828 line:82%
-That crowd is actually our advantage.
-What?

1912
01:53:28.036 --> 01:53:29.661 line:82%
We’re going to use the crowd to steal.

1913
01:53:29.744 --> 01:53:30.828 line:82%
How is that an advantage?

1914
01:53:31.453 --> 01:53:33.078 line:82%
I’ll explain later.

1915
01:53:33.161 --> 01:53:34.619 line:82%
What about "my street" or "my factory"?

1916
01:53:34.828 --> 01:53:36.869 line:82%
No, he would’ve said "our street"
or "our factory."

1917
01:53:36.994 --> 01:53:39.661 line:82%
"My town," "my theater,"
"my school," "my family"?

1918
01:53:39.744 --> 01:53:40.744 line:82%
Hold on!

1919
01:53:41.869 --> 01:53:44.286 line:82%
Brother, there’s a strong chance
he was saying "my school."

1920
01:53:44.536 --> 01:53:45.536 line:82%
Correct.

1921
01:53:45.869 --> 01:53:50.661 line:82%
Every time we had an issue with
the school, that’s when he hit us.

1922
01:53:50.953 --> 01:53:53.744 line:82%
Even the day our boy was attacked,
he was at the school.

1923
01:53:54.911 --> 01:53:58.119 line:82%
"My school," "my master," "my teacher."

1924
01:53:58.703 --> 01:53:59.703 line:82%
We got him!

1925
01:54:01.078 --> 01:54:03.286 line:82%
It’s someone from the school.

1926
01:54:03.911 --> 01:54:06.453 line:82%
The school, that’s the link.

1927
01:54:09.078 --> 01:54:11.411 line:82%
All these years,

1928
01:54:12.869 --> 01:54:14.536 line:82%
I've only hidden my face,

1929
01:54:15.828 --> 01:54:17.203 line:82%
not my character.

1930
01:54:19.286 --> 01:54:20.244 line:82%
I’ll show him.

1931
01:54:20.369 --> 01:54:22.328 line:82%
We know the locker’s location.

1932
01:54:22.453 --> 01:54:24.869 line:82%
Now we just need the third key.

1933
01:54:25.078 --> 01:54:28.036 line:82%
To get that, I’m going alone tonight
to Mudiarasan’s house.

1934
01:54:28.203 --> 01:54:29.786 line:82%
Do you know where his room is?

1935
01:54:30.578 --> 01:54:32.786 line:82%
So far, he’s made you take all the risks.

1936
01:54:32.953 --> 01:54:34.703 line:82%
But now he’s going alone.
What does that mean?

1937
01:54:34.786 --> 01:54:35.786 line:82%
What?

1938
01:54:35.911 --> 01:54:37.828 line:82%
He’s going to escape with the third key!

1939
01:54:38.078 --> 01:54:39.994 line:82%
It’s better if one of us goes with him.

1940
01:54:40.078 --> 01:54:41.036 line:82%
Who?

1941
01:54:41.203 --> 01:54:42.203 line:82%
Who else?

1942
01:54:42.411 --> 01:54:44.453 line:82%
You’re the commando of the Gangers.

1943
01:54:44.578 --> 01:54:46.994 line:82%
Operation Singaram is the real deal!

1944
01:54:47.078 --> 01:54:48.619 line:82%
I’ve never operated anyone.

1945
01:54:49.619 --> 01:54:50.661 line:82%
Money is everything.

1946
01:54:51.119 --> 01:54:52.994 line:82%
If we don’t do this right,
all our efforts will go to waste.

1947
01:54:53.036 --> 01:54:54.411 line:82%
What effort did you put in?

1948
01:54:54.453 --> 01:54:56.661 line:82%
I’m the one struggling
with you in the team.

1949
01:54:57.244 --> 01:54:59.536 line:82%
Alright, fine.
A cop always makes sense.

1950
01:54:59.578 --> 01:55:00.578 line:82%
Wait.

1951
01:55:00.703 --> 01:55:01.619 line:82%
Saravana!

1952
01:55:02.078 --> 01:55:03.453 line:82%
I’ll come with you to get the key.

1953
01:55:03.578 --> 01:55:05.161 line:82%
Singaram, it’s very risky.

1954
01:55:05.203 --> 01:55:08.203 line:82%
Hey! You sent me on a risky
tour earlier too, remember?

1955
01:55:08.244 --> 01:55:09.203 line:82%
I’ll come with you!

1956
01:55:11.369 --> 01:55:12.286 line:82%
Alright, come on.

1957
01:55:12.328 --> 01:55:13.244 line:82%
Saravana, be careful.

1958
01:55:13.328 --> 01:55:14.536 line:82%
I’m the one going with him.

1959
01:55:14.661 --> 01:55:15.744 line:82%
That’s why I want him to be careful.

1960
01:55:24.411 --> 01:55:26.244 line:82%
Their men might be on rounds.

1961
01:55:26.286 --> 01:55:27.869 line:82%
So we need to stay alert
and get the job done.

1962
01:55:28.494 --> 01:55:30.453 line:82%
Just for the sake of measely salary,

1963
01:55:30.536 --> 01:55:34.078 line:82%
I work so hard under a stupid H.M,
without even breaking a sweat!

1964
01:55:34.161 --> 01:55:35.869 line:82%
-When I'm working for crores--
-Shut up!

1965
01:55:36.286 --> 01:55:39.578 line:82%
I’ll go to any lengths to get that key!
Just tell me what to do.

1966
01:55:39.703 --> 01:55:42.869 line:82%
Get into the house, slap the back
you like hard, and then run off!

1967
01:55:43.286 --> 01:55:44.786 line:82%
Why does it have to be a back I like?

1968
01:55:44.869 --> 01:55:46.411 line:82%
If I do that,
they'll let us in?

1969
01:55:46.453 --> 01:55:48.619 line:82%
No, everyone will start chasing you!

1970
01:55:49.453 --> 01:55:50.411 line:82%
I get your plan.

1971
01:55:50.453 --> 01:55:54.328 line:82%
When they all capture and
maim me like a lamb at a meat stall,

1972
01:55:54.369 --> 01:55:56.911 line:82%
you’ll use that gap to steal all the money
and escape. Isn’t that your plan?

1973
01:55:58.369 --> 01:56:00.494 line:82%
Listen, when you do that,
they'll chase you.

1974
01:56:00.619 --> 01:56:01.744 line:82%
Find a way to escape.

1975
01:56:01.994 --> 01:56:03.161 line:82%
I’ll use that moment to get inside.

1976
01:56:03.369 --> 01:56:05.161 line:82%
Find a way to escape?

1977
01:56:06.786 --> 01:56:08.244 line:82%
Huh? What is this?

1978
01:56:08.661 --> 01:56:10.578 line:82%
I thought they’d be on rounds,
but they’re sleeping.

1979
01:56:10.828 --> 01:56:11.869 line:82%
Anyway, good for me.

1980
01:56:14.369 --> 01:56:15.453 line:82%
No, no!

1981
01:56:17.619 --> 01:56:19.536 line:82%
Oh god! I jumped too high.

1982
01:56:22.703 --> 01:56:23.828 line:82%
What happened?

1983
01:56:24.619 --> 01:56:25.869 line:82%
It's nothing.

1984
01:56:26.286 --> 01:56:27.953 line:82%
Why did I have to jump?

1985
01:56:28.161 --> 01:56:30.161 line:82%
How much can my body handle down there?

1986
01:56:30.994 --> 01:56:32.536 line:82%
They're sleeping?

1987
01:56:32.703 --> 01:56:34.828 line:82%
Who cares? I’ll just do what he said.

1988
01:56:36.078 --> 01:56:38.244 line:82%
Hey! Why are you hitting
the one who’s sleeping?

1989
01:56:38.869 --> 01:56:39.744 line:82%
So what?

1990
01:56:39.786 --> 01:56:41.036 line:82%
He'll wake up and chase me.

1991
01:56:41.036 --> 01:56:42.078 line:82%
Wasn't that our plan?

1992
01:56:42.119 --> 01:56:43.286 line:82%
Don't be stupid, Singaram.

1993
01:56:43.369 --> 01:56:45.911 line:82%
They’re all sleeping.
We can just walk by quietly.

1994
01:56:47.036 --> 01:56:48.036 line:82%
Listen.

1995
01:56:48.369 --> 01:56:50.244 line:82%
From now on, your plans
won't work for me.

1996
01:56:50.453 --> 01:56:52.494 line:82%
-Listen to my plan.
-What plan?

1997
01:56:53.078 --> 01:56:54.078 line:82%
Let's go.

1998
01:56:55.869 --> 01:56:57.661 line:82%
Mudiarasan's room is on the top floor.

1999
01:56:58.078 --> 01:57:01.119 line:82%
If you squat, I'll climb on you
and get in through the balcony

2000
01:57:01.161 --> 01:57:03.161 line:82%
and I'll open the main door for you, okay?

2001
01:57:03.578 --> 01:57:05.619 line:82%
That’s a big height.
Will you be able to do it?

2002
01:57:05.744 --> 01:57:09.244 line:82%
Monkeys would feel ashamed
watching me climb trees.

2003
01:57:09.369 --> 01:57:12.078 line:82%
Don’t insult me by asking such questions.

2004
01:57:12.161 --> 01:57:13.161 line:82%

Madam, you can’t take a mobile

02:06:50.119 --> 02:06:50.953 line:82%
Please hand it over.

2175
02:06:51.119 --> 02:06:52.619 line:82%
-Oh, sorry.
-It's okay.

2176
02:07:28.078 --> 02:07:29.078 line:82%
I'm here.

2177
02:07:29.411 --> 02:07:30.411 line:82%
Me too.

2178
02:07:30.494 --> 02:07:32.036 line:82%

In Soori’s wife’s phone,

2183
02:08:18.328 --> 02:08:21.036 line:82%
there are four numbers under ‘Husband.’

2184
02:08:21.286 --> 02:08:22.994 line:82%
So, he has four phones.

2185
02:08:22.994 --> 02:08:24.536 line:82%
-Try calling them all.
-Alright.

2186
02:08:25.286 --> 02:08:26.411 line:82%
I’ll try the first one.

2187
02:08:26.494 --> 02:08:27.536 line:82%
Hey, my baby!

2188
02:08:28.203 --> 02:08:29.328 line:82%
I’m driving.

2189
02:08:29.453 --> 02:08:31.161 line:82%
Give me a sweet kiss first.

2190
02:08:35.244 --> 02:08:38.036 line:82%
Damn, some auto driver is
showering kisses.

2191
02:08:38.536 --> 02:08:40.869 line:82%
Must be a wrong number.

2192
02:08:40.953 --> 02:08:42.328 line:82%
Try the next one.

2193
02:08:45.328 --> 02:08:46.994 line:82%
Hello, I want popcorn.

2194
02:08:47.161 --> 02:08:48.994 line:82%
Crispy, with lots of spice.

2195
02:08:49.036 --> 02:08:50.078 line:82%
Is this a hotel?

2196
02:08:50.119 --> 02:08:51.161 line:82%
You’re asking for varieties?

2197
02:08:51.244 --> 02:08:52.328 line:82%
You get what you get.

2198
02:08:52.369 --> 02:08:53.203 line:82%
Idiot!

2199
02:08:53.244 --> 02:08:55.203 line:82%
Doesn’t know the difference between
a theatre and a hotel.

2200
02:08:59.786 --> 02:09:00.828 line:82%
Oh, god!

2201
02:09:03.286 --> 02:09:04.578 line:82%
Hey, where’s my popcorn?

2202
02:09:04.619 --> 02:09:07.244 line:82%
The machine itself is gone.

2203
02:09:07.786 --> 02:09:08.786 line:82%
Job’s done.

2204
02:09:08.828 --> 02:09:10.161 line:82%
This manager’s gonna shout at me.

2205
02:09:13.036 --> 02:09:13.744 line:82%
Tell me, sir.

2206
02:09:13.744 --> 02:09:15.619 line:82%
The popcorn machine’s broken
in the theatre.

2207
02:09:15.619 --> 02:09:16.661 line:82%
Send someone for repairs, quickly.

2208
02:09:16.703 --> 02:09:17.911 line:82%
I’ll send someone right away.

2209
02:09:23.036 --> 02:09:25.036 line:82%
I’m on the way. You can begin.

2210
02:09:25.203 --> 02:09:26.203 line:82%
Okay.

2211
02:09:28.744 --> 02:09:30.119 line:82%
Hey, sweetie!

2212
02:09:30.244 --> 02:09:33.453 line:82%
After you came by yesterday,
the whole shop smells like you.

2213
02:09:33.703 --> 02:09:35.328 line:82%
Come today after I close
the shop, as usual.

2214
02:09:35.494 --> 02:09:38.203 line:82%
I’ll put you on the rice sack and
have my way with you.

2215
02:09:38.619 --> 02:09:40.036 line:82%
This is another affair of hers.

2216
02:09:40.286 --> 02:09:42.869 line:82%
That was our Rasappan from
the grocery store.

2217
02:09:43.036 --> 02:09:45.578 line:82%
They are using the rice sacks as a bed.

2218
02:09:45.786 --> 02:09:48.828 line:82%
Is that why the rice from his
store is always wet?

2219
02:09:48.994 --> 02:09:49.994 line:82%
Forget that.

2220
02:09:50.119 --> 02:09:51.286 line:82%
Is our plan on track?

2221
02:09:51.369 --> 02:09:52.536 line:82%
On the way.

2222
02:09:57.744 --> 02:09:58.744 line:82%
Hey!

2223
02:09:58.869 --> 02:10:00.703 line:82%
Hey! You idiot!

2224
02:10:00.744 --> 02:10:02.536 line:82%
What are you doing in the ladies' toilet?

2225
02:10:02.619 --> 02:10:04.161 line:82%
No, this is the CCTV room.

2226
02:10:04.328 --> 02:10:05.953 line:82%
DGP's room?

2227
02:10:06.411 --> 02:10:07.786 line:82%
CCTV room!

2228
02:10:08.161 --> 02:10:10.369 line:82%
Oh, the CID's room.

2229
02:10:10.494 --> 02:10:11.619 line:82%
CCTV room?

2230
02:10:14.161 --> 02:10:15.661 line:82%
What's happening?

2231
02:10:15.911 --> 02:10:17.161 line:82%
Who did this?

2232
02:10:17.411 --> 02:10:20.244 line:82%
Shucks! The kids these days.

2233
02:10:20.369 --> 02:10:21.244 line:82%
Oh god!

2234
02:10:21.369 --> 02:10:23.828 line:82%
-I'm fainting, I'm fainting.
-Granny, granny!

2235
02:10:23.869 --> 02:10:24.953 line:82%
Someone help me.

2236
02:10:25.036 --> 02:10:26.578 line:82%
-What happened?
-It's nothing, son.

2237
02:10:26.661 --> 02:10:29.161 line:82%
My limbs are going numb.
Can you massage me?

2238
02:10:29.244 --> 02:10:31.828 line:82%
-I've got work to do.
-Never say no to an old person.

2239
02:10:31.953 --> 02:10:33.328 line:82%
Then you'll never have a place
in heaven, my son.

2240
02:10:33.453 --> 02:10:35.411 line:82%
-What?
-Come on, do it fast.

2241
02:10:35.744 --> 02:10:37.661 line:82%
-Faster!
-Why the urgency?

2242
02:10:37.786 --> 02:10:40.286 line:82%
I don't want to miss an important
scene in the movie, that's why.

2243
02:10:46.619 --> 02:10:48.994 line:82%
Hey! Why are you switching places?

2244
02:10:50.619 --> 02:10:52.744 line:82%
-Hey! It's a success.
-What?

2245
02:10:52.869 --> 02:10:54.661 line:82%
I meant your massage is a success!

2246
02:10:54.744 --> 02:10:56.869 line:82%
You should make this your full-time job!

2247
02:10:57.286 --> 02:10:59.286 line:82%
None of them are Soori's numbers.

2248
02:10:59.328 --> 02:11:00.828 line:82%
Try searching for 'Soori'.

2249
02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:02.286 line:82%
S.

2250
02:11:03.536 --> 02:11:05.369 line:82%
There's only a Stepney under 'S'.

2251
02:11:05.453 --> 02:11:07.953 line:82%
If she has saved someone as 'stepney'

2252
02:11:08.078 --> 02:11:10.494 line:82%
then we need to know who
that disgusting person is.

2253
02:11:10.744 --> 02:11:12.328 line:82%
-Call him.
-Okay.

2254
02:11:17.078 --> 02:11:18.911 line:82%
Hello, I'm in the theater, dear. Tell me.

2255
02:11:18.994 --> 02:11:20.536 line:82%
It's Soori!

2256
02:11:20.828 --> 02:11:24.619 line:82%
This is the first time I’m hearing
a husband being called a Stepney.

2257
02:11:24.661 --> 02:11:26.828 line:82%
-Hey! Talk to Soori.
-Yes, yes.

2258
02:11:27.119 --> 02:11:31.661 line:82%
Hey! Stay strong.
I’ve kidnapped your wife.

2259
02:11:31.869 --> 02:11:34.244 line:82%
Who are you?
Are you telling the truth?

2260
02:11:34.328 --> 02:11:35.328 line:82%
Yes!

2261
02:11:35.494 --> 02:11:38.536 line:82%
Bring me a lakh at the place
and time I specify.

2262
02:11:38.619 --> 02:11:39.869 line:82%
I don’t care who you are

2263
02:11:39.994 --> 02:11:42.119 line:82%
Not just one, I’ll pay one and a half.

2264
02:11:42.286 --> 02:11:43.286 line:82%
Kill her!

2265
02:11:44.328 --> 02:11:46.703 line:82%
Hello? Hello!
Damn, he cut the call.

2266
02:11:48.911 --> 02:11:50.619 line:82%
-Hello.
-Why did you cut the call?

2267
02:11:50.703 --> 02:11:52.453 line:82%
-Tell me.
-You want me to kill her?

2268
02:11:52.578 --> 02:11:54.494 line:82%
I’ll never get another chance like this.

2269
02:11:54.578 --> 02:11:57.536 line:82%
Just finish her off,
and I’ll send you the money.

2270
02:11:58.244 --> 02:11:59.244 line:82%
Hello?

2271
02:12:00.286 --> 02:12:01.994 line:82%
We thought we could threaten
him to come out,

2272
02:12:02.411 --> 02:12:03.619 line:82%
and he’s asking us to kill his wife?

2273
02:12:03.786 --> 02:12:04.911 line:82%
Saravana...

2274
02:12:05.078 --> 02:12:08.536 line:82%
With her phone we can bring anyone
and everyone

2275
02:12:08.703 --> 02:12:10.828 line:82%
But we won’t be able to get
Soori out with that.

2276
02:12:10.911 --> 02:12:13.286 line:82%
I’ve reached the theater.
You begin Plan B.

2277
02:12:13.369 --> 02:12:14.411 line:82%
Okay!

2278
02:12:16.703 --> 02:12:18.536 line:82%
-What's this?
-Popcorn machine service.

2279
02:12:18.578 --> 02:12:20.161 line:82%
-It looks so big.
-It's a new system, sir.

2280
02:12:20.244 --> 02:12:21.119 line:82%
-Okay, go on.
-Thanks.

2281
02:12:21.203 --> 02:12:23.828 line:82%
Uncle! This is Thayamma.
She's very close to the teacher.

2282
02:12:23.953 --> 02:12:27.536 line:82%
There’s something off about the reason
the teacher gave for going with my son.

2283
02:12:28.369 --> 02:12:29.578 line:82%
How is she as a person?

2284
02:12:29.661 --> 02:12:32.203 line:82%
-She’s very good-hearted.
-I don’t care about that.

2285
02:12:32.661 --> 02:12:34.161 line:82%
Does she have an affair?

2286
02:12:34.328 --> 02:12:37.078 line:82%
I heard she’s involved with
the PT master at the school.

2287
02:12:37.244 --> 02:12:39.953 line:82%
You mean Singaram?
He’s dark and looks odd!

2288
02:12:40.036 --> 02:12:41.494 line:82%
No, the other one.

2289
02:12:42.203 --> 02:12:44.453 line:82%
He’s fair and about six feet tall.

2290
02:12:45.994 --> 02:12:46.994 line:82%
His name?

2291
02:12:47.203 --> 02:12:50.244 line:82%
Look at how the blast has
damaged the machine.

2292
02:12:50.369 --> 02:12:52.619 line:82%
I used to make so much selling popcorn.

2293
02:12:52.703 --> 02:12:53.994 line:82%
-Now, it's all gone.
-A customer.

2294
02:12:56.661 --> 02:12:57.994 line:82%
What do you want?

2295
02:12:58.119 --> 02:12:59.161 line:82%
I want justice.

2296
02:12:59.286 --> 02:13:02.203 line:82%
We have only samosas, chips,
and cool drinks.

2297
02:13:02.244 --> 02:13:03.786 line:82%
We don't have the snacks called justice.

2298
02:13:03.869 --> 02:13:05.494 line:82%
I'm not here for snacks!

2299
02:13:05.578 --> 02:13:07.078 line:82%
Someone here has misbehaved with my niece.

2300
02:13:07.161 --> 02:13:08.494 line:82%
and I'm here to get justice for that.

2301
02:13:08.578 --> 02:13:09.744 line:82%
-Really?
-Yes!

2302
02:13:09.828 --> 02:13:11.411 line:82%
-Who's your niece?
-I'll call her.

2303
02:13:11.578 --> 02:13:12.578 line:82%
Come, dear.

2304
02:13:15.453 --> 02:13:17.078 line:82%
Hey, tell me where he is.

2305
02:13:17.161 --> 02:13:20.411 line:82%
Lady! Even you're okay in a way!

2306
02:13:21.078 --> 02:13:23.119 line:82%
Who would want to misbehave
with a face like this?

2307
02:13:23.203 --> 02:13:24.328 line:82%
Shut your mouth!

2308
02:13:24.411 --> 02:13:26.786 line:82%
A person working at your theatre
misbehaved with her, made her pregnant

2309
02:13:26.828 --> 02:13:28.036 line:82%
and then abandoned her.

2310
02:13:28.078 --> 02:13:29.994 line:82%
Tell me where he is! Or else...

2311
02:13:30.286 --> 02:13:31.656 line:82%
Alright, what's his name?

2312
02:13:31.682 --> 02:13:33.703 line:82%
His name... his name...

2313
02:13:33.828 --> 02:13:35.161 line:82%
Tell me his name.

2314
02:13:35.203 --> 02:13:35.994 line:82%
Soori!

2315
02:13:36.119 --> 02:13:38.078 line:82%
He's saying something with 'Su'.
What is it?

2316
02:13:39.244 --> 02:13:40.328 line:82%
Soo-ri!

2317
02:13:40.911 --> 02:13:42.203 line:82%
Su.. Suruli!

2318
02:13:43.578 --> 02:13:45.494 line:82%
-Suruli, sir?
-Yes, call him now.

2319
02:13:45.578 --> 02:13:47.078 line:82%
He deserves no respect!

2320
02:13:47.536 --> 02:13:48.536 line:82%
Suruli, sir!

2321
02:13:48.869 --> 02:13:49.703 line:82%
Come here!

2322
02:13:49.869 --> 02:13:50.869 line:82%
This guy?

2323
02:13:51.036 --> 02:13:52.911 line:82%
Why isn't the manager coming out?

2324
02:13:52.994 --> 02:13:55.203 line:82%
-Did I get the names wrong?
-Just continue, we have no other choice.

2325
02:13:55.328 --> 02:13:56.328 line:82%
What is it?

2326
02:13:56.453 --> 02:13:57.453 line:82%
My dear!

2327
02:13:57.869 --> 02:13:59.703 line:82%
Hey, don't you recognize her?

2328
02:14:00.119 --> 02:14:01.119 line:82%
My hubby.

2329
02:14:01.369 --> 02:14:02.869 line:82%
-Who is that?
-Did you hear that, aunty?

2330
02:14:03.078 --> 02:14:04.703 line:82%
He's asking who I am in front of you.

2331
02:14:04.744 --> 02:14:06.744 line:82%
That's what anyone would ask if
they don’t know someone.

2332
02:14:09.411 --> 02:14:10.453 line:82%
I’ve switched on the jammer.

2333
02:14:10.494 --> 02:14:12.786 line:82%
Other than our gang
connected to this Wi-Fi,

2334
02:14:12.911 --> 02:14:14.286 line:82%
no one else will recieve calls.

2335
02:14:14.453 --> 02:14:18.119 line:82%
You've misbehaved with my niece,
who was like fresh fruit, and ruined her.

2336
02:14:18.203 --> 02:14:19.203 line:82%
Misbehaved?

2337
02:14:20.369 --> 02:14:23.744 line:82%
She already looks like a
spoiled, rotten fruit!

2338
02:14:23.869 --> 02:14:25.494 line:82%
He’s also saying the same thing!

2339
02:14:25.828 --> 02:14:27.661 line:82%
Shucks! He looks exactly like that.

2340
02:14:27.994 --> 02:14:29.786 line:82%
Am I going to get caught?

2341
02:14:45.119 --> 02:14:46.328 line:82%
Sir, where are you going?

2342
02:14:46.453 --> 02:14:47.661 line:82%
I’m not getting through to
anyone at the theatre.

2343
02:14:47.703 --> 02:14:48.661 line:82%
I’m going to check in person.

2344
02:14:48.828 --> 02:14:50.036 line:82%
But the main ritual is yet to happen.

2345
02:14:50.078 --> 02:14:51.203 line:82%
This is more important.

2346
02:14:52.578 --> 02:14:53.953 line:82%
Malaiarasan is on his way.

2347
02:14:56.203 --> 02:14:57.411 line:82%
-Suji.
-Tell me.

2348
02:14:57.536 --> 02:14:58.786 line:82%
-Plan C.
-Okay.

2349
02:15:00.661 --> 02:15:03.578 line:82%
Sir, I don’t know how,
but Saravanan’s data is missing.

2350
02:15:05.453 --> 02:15:06.619 line:82%
Send me his picture.

2351
02:15:08.744 --> 02:15:11.453 line:82%
What proof do you have that
it was our manager?

2352
02:15:11.536 --> 02:15:12.536 line:82%
I’ll tell you.

2353
02:15:12.578 --> 02:15:13.619 line:82%
Take off his pants and look.

2354
02:15:13.661 --> 02:15:15.869 line:82%
There's a hole in his thigh!

2355
02:15:15.953 --> 02:15:18.203 line:82%
A hole? Am I a donut?

2356
02:15:21.744 --> 02:15:23.578 line:82%
-Where are you going?
-There’s no time.

2357
02:15:23.828 --> 02:15:25.036 line:82%
So? Things will go wrong.

2358
02:15:26.328 --> 02:15:28.161 line:82%
Sir, you can’t be here.

2359
02:15:28.786 --> 02:15:30.744 line:82%
Toilets and canteen are that way. Go!

2360
02:15:30.869 --> 02:15:32.536 line:82%
I have no connection with any of you.

2361
02:15:32.578 --> 02:15:34.119 line:82%
I’ve got work in that room.

2362
02:15:34.244 --> 02:15:35.328 line:82%
Move aside.

2363
02:15:35.453 --> 02:15:36.328 line:82%
Yeah, right.

2364
02:15:36.369 --> 02:15:37.411 line:82%
You’ve got work.

2365
02:15:37.453 --> 02:15:38.828 line:82%
You think we’re here
for time pass?

2366
02:15:40.786 --> 02:15:42.286 line:82%
I don’t have time to talk.

2367
02:15:42.411 --> 02:15:43.786 line:82%
Just move or else...

2368
02:15:43.828 --> 02:15:45.536 line:82%
Or else what? What will you do?

2369
02:15:45.744 --> 02:15:46.786 line:82%
I'll end you!

2370
02:15:58.744 --> 02:16:00.286 line:82%
-That's him!
-That's the guy!

2371
02:16:01.619 --> 02:16:02.869 line:82%
Why did you do this?

2372
02:16:02.953 --> 02:16:04.119 line:82%
We’re here to steal.

2373
02:16:04.244 --> 02:16:06.286 line:82%
Instead of doing it quietly,
you’re being violent.

2374
02:16:14.328 --> 02:16:15.244 line:82%
-Aunty!
-What?

2375
02:16:15.286 --> 02:16:17.286 line:82%
He has a mole on his chest.
Check that first.

2376
02:16:17.328 --> 02:16:18.661 line:82%
Hey, take off your shirt.

2377
02:16:20.119 --> 02:16:20.786 line:82%
Start.

2378
02:16:20.869 --> 02:16:22.119 line:82%
Oh God! Fire, fire, fire.

2379
02:16:22.203 --> 02:16:24.119 line:82%
The whole theatre is burning!

2380
02:16:24.244 --> 02:16:25.911 line:82%
The flames are rising! Oh god!

2381
02:16:32.578 --> 02:16:34.786 line:82%
First the pants, and now you want
me to take off my shirt?

2382
02:16:34.869 --> 02:16:36.369 line:82%
Why did you close the screen?

2383
02:16:36.453 --> 02:16:38.119 line:82%
-What? Hey, open it up.
-Okay, sir.

2384
02:16:38.953 --> 02:16:39.953 line:82%
Damn!

2385
02:16:47.536 --> 02:16:49.661 line:82%
Malaiarasan is here.

2386
02:16:51.161 --> 02:16:53.369 line:82%
Hey! Stop it, stop it.

2387
02:16:53.494 --> 02:16:55.536 line:82%
-What's the issue?
-The first problem is this oldie, sir.

2388
02:16:55.619 --> 02:16:57.869 line:82%
No, sir. They closed the screen
while the movie was running.

2389
02:16:57.994 --> 02:16:59.411 line:82%
Why hasn't he come out yet?

2390
02:17:00.536 --> 02:17:01.911 line:82%
The call didn't get through...

2391
02:17:02.161 --> 02:17:04.661 line:82%
Hey, Gopi! Who brought the screen down?

2392
02:17:04.786 --> 02:17:06.286 line:82%
-Go, lift it back up!
-Okay, sir!

2393
02:17:09.411 --> 02:17:11.036 line:82%
The screen is up! Everyone, get inside.

2394
02:17:11.161 --> 02:17:13.369 line:82%
-Go on. Get inside.
-The screen is up!

2395
02:17:15.828 --> 02:17:16.828 line:82%
Here.

2396
02:17:20.744 --> 02:17:21.786 line:82%
Get in fast!

2397
02:17:21.911 --> 02:17:23.328 line:82%
-Why couldn't I reach Soori?
-I have no idea, sir.

2398
02:17:23.453 --> 02:17:25.161 line:82%
Singaram, make sure he doesn't
come near the locker room.

2399
02:17:25.244 --> 02:17:26.244 line:82%
I'll take care of that.

2400
02:17:27.036 --> 02:17:28.578 line:82%
-Are you the theatre owner?
-Yes.

2401
02:17:28.661 --> 02:17:31.536 line:82%
-Give justice to my niece first.
-Who are you?

2402
02:17:31.786 --> 02:17:34.244 line:82%
Me? Ask him who I am.

2403
02:17:34.369 --> 02:17:37.661 line:82%
This scoundrel misbehaved
with my niece and got her pregnant!

2404
02:17:37.786 --> 02:17:38.786 line:82%
This one?

2405
02:17:41.036 --> 02:17:42.619 line:82%
Go stop him!

2406
02:17:43.119 --> 02:17:45.744 line:82%
Hey, if you keep saying that,
things will get ugly.

2407
02:17:45.786 --> 02:17:47.328 line:82%
We won’t move an inch without justice!

2408
02:17:47.369 --> 02:17:49.161 line:82%
We’ll sit here and protest!

2409
02:17:50.036 --> 02:17:51.578 line:82%
Why is there so much smoke?

2410
02:17:54.828 --> 02:17:56.494 line:82%
Soori looks like a Hobbit!

2411
02:17:56.578 --> 02:17:57.953 line:82%
Who are you all?

2412
02:17:58.578 --> 02:18:01.328 line:82%
-Take your hands off me.
-No, I won’t until we get justice.

2413
02:18:01.411 --> 02:18:02.994 line:82%
I’m holding back because you’re
a woman, or I’ll thrash you.

2414
02:18:03.078 --> 02:18:04.078 line:82%
Move!

2415
02:18:04.244 --> 02:18:05.411 line:82%
Grab the box first.

2416
02:18:06.078 --> 02:18:08.411 line:82%
Oh god. He’s going that way!

2417
02:18:12.036 --> 02:18:13.411 line:82%
My lord, please save me.

2418
02:18:15.453 --> 02:18:16.619 line:82%
Thank you god!

2419
02:18:18.536 --> 02:18:20.369 line:82%
We’re almost there.
Don’t let him come in.

2420
02:18:21.244 --> 02:18:22.703 line:82%
I won't let it go!

2421
02:18:23.411 --> 02:18:25.619 line:82%
-I won't, I won't!
-Hey, you're still here?

2422
02:18:25.661 --> 02:18:27.953 line:82%
I won't leave until my niece gets justice.

2423
02:18:28.078 --> 02:18:29.078 line:82%
Hey, move!

2424
02:18:30.328 --> 02:18:31.328 line:82%
-Saravana!
-What?

2425
02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:32.453 line:82%
Finish the job quickly.

2426
02:18:32.536 --> 02:18:34.203 line:82%
My niece's beard is growing back.

2427
02:18:34.578 --> 02:18:37.369 line:82%
-They'll skin us alive if we get caught.
-Go handle Malaiarasan first.

2428
02:18:39.203 --> 02:18:40.203 line:82%
What's this behaviour?

2429
02:18:40.536 --> 02:18:43.453 line:82%
I'm talking about injustice, and
you're checking yourself in the mirror?

2430
02:18:43.703 --> 02:18:44.911 line:82%
I'll kill you!

2431
02:18:45.994 --> 02:18:47.369 line:82%
-You're done?
-Not yet.

2432
02:18:47.494 --> 02:18:48.494 line:82%
Make it quick!

2433
02:18:48.911 --> 02:18:49.911 line:82%
What?!

2434
02:18:50.036 --> 02:18:52.036 line:82%
No, I meant give me justice quickly.

2435
02:18:52.078 --> 02:18:53.244 line:82%
Hey, throw her out.

2436
02:18:53.328 --> 02:18:54.411 line:82%
Come on.
No, I won’t leave.

2437
02:18:54.494 --> 02:18:57.119 line:82%
I will never ever leave him!
No, no! Let go!

2438
02:18:57.203 --> 02:18:58.203 line:82%
Get out!

2439
02:19:07.453 --> 02:19:08.453 line:82%
Sir.

2440
02:19:11.453 --> 02:19:14.036 line:82%
-Why was your phone unreachable?
-There was a signal issue, sir.

2441
02:19:16.369 --> 02:19:17.369 line:82%
All good?

2442
02:19:17.744 --> 02:19:19.994 line:82%
-Everything--
-Hey! Answer your boss.

2443
02:19:20.036 --> 02:19:21.619 line:82%
How dare you come inside? Get out!

2444
02:19:22.536 --> 02:19:24.369 line:82%
-What the hell is your problem?
-He's my problem!

2445
02:19:24.453 --> 02:19:25.661 line:82%
Ask him to marry her.

2446
02:19:25.744 --> 02:19:27.578 line:82%
You're making me a judge for
this stupid face?!

2447
02:19:27.828 --> 02:19:28.619 line:82%
He deserves it!

2448
02:19:28.703 --> 02:19:30.203 line:82%
How dare you try to abandon her?

2449
02:19:31.578 --> 02:19:33.161 line:82%
Get him out of there!

2450
02:19:33.244 --> 02:19:35.119 line:82%
I will! Come on.

2451
02:19:36.536 --> 02:19:38.828 line:82%
Damn, I’ve put my hand into
a crocodile’s mouth.

2452
02:19:38.869 --> 02:19:40.036 line:82%
What’s gonna happen now?

2453
02:19:40.786 --> 02:19:41.786 line:82%
Oh, my god!

2454
02:19:41.953 --> 02:19:43.036 line:82%
How dare you hit me?

2455
02:19:44.161 --> 02:19:45.703 line:82%
Hey, catch her and tie her up!

2456
02:19:48.078 --> 02:19:50.203 line:82%
I've no idea where to run.

2457
02:19:50.286 --> 02:19:51.911 line:82%
-I'll go this side.
-Hey, oldie. Stop running!

2458
02:20:09.661 --> 02:20:11.536 line:82%
Hey, did you look that side?

2459
02:20:11.578 --> 02:20:13.453 line:82%
There morons are blocking the screen!
Ask them to move.

2460
02:20:13.661 --> 02:20:14.994 line:82%
-Hey, wait!
-Stop shouting!

2461
02:20:15.119 --> 02:20:16.953 line:82%
-Give us a second.
-We're leaving!

2462
02:20:25.661 --> 02:20:26.661 line:82%
Damn!

2463
02:20:48.786 --> 02:20:50.036 line:82%
When did Saravanan leave?

2464
02:20:50.286 --> 02:20:52.119 line:82%
-He left in the morning.
-Where did he go?

2465
02:20:52.203 --> 02:20:53.203 line:82%
I don't know, sir.

2466
02:20:53.994 --> 02:20:54.994 line:82%
Saravanan!

2467
02:20:55.036 --> 02:20:56.369 line:82%
This much is 100 crores?

2468
02:20:56.411 --> 02:20:58.286 line:82%
Nope, there's more.

2469
02:20:58.328 --> 02:21:00.286 line:82%
They've stored all the money they made
in the last three years here.

2470
02:21:00.328 --> 02:21:01.744 line:82%
My head is spinning.

2471
02:21:03.536 --> 02:21:04.453 line:82%
Hey!

2472
02:21:04.536 --> 02:21:05.661 line:82%
What's that sound?

2473
02:21:05.869 --> 02:21:06.869 line:82%
It's the alarm!

2474
02:21:07.036 --> 02:21:09.494 line:82%
Now, Mudiarasan knows we're here.

2475
02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:10.661 line:82%
I missed it.

2476
02:21:10.744 --> 02:21:12.453 line:82%
We need to finish the job before
he gets here. Come on!

2477
02:21:13.578 --> 02:21:14.578 line:82%
She's there!

2478
02:21:20.578 --> 02:21:21.578 line:82%
Hello!

2479
02:21:22.578 --> 02:21:23.578 line:82%
Hello!

2480
02:21:24.911 --> 02:21:26.578 line:82%
What are they doing?
Let's go!

2481
02:21:34.411 --> 02:21:35.494 line:82%
Go check on the right side!

2482
02:21:43.786 --> 02:21:45.036 line:82%
-Saravana.
-What?

2483
02:21:45.119 --> 02:21:46.786 line:82%
Give me 100 crores later.

2484
02:21:46.869 --> 02:21:48.536 line:82%
Now, give me 12 bucks.

2485
02:21:48.578 --> 02:21:50.494 line:82%
I really want to have juice.

2486
02:21:50.786 --> 02:21:52.536 line:82%
Just a little longer.
Keep it under control!

2487
02:22:13.994 --> 02:22:15.536 line:82%
-She's right there. Catch her!
-Come on, come on.

2488
02:22:15.869 --> 02:22:17.119 line:82%
Don't let her escape!

2489
02:22:17.161 --> 02:22:18.703 line:82%
Go that side.

2490
02:22:19.536 --> 02:22:21.953 line:82%
Hey! My niece is right there.
Get her first.

2491
02:22:22.036 --> 02:22:23.036 line:82%
Catch her!

2492
02:22:23.494 --> 02:22:24.536 line:82%
Hey, stop!

2493
02:22:31.328 --> 02:22:35.744 line:82%
Om Sakthi! Para Sakthi!

2494
02:22:36.453 --> 02:22:38.286 line:82%
Sir, your brother is here.

2495
02:22:39.619 --> 02:22:41.786 line:82%
-Brother?
-Why weren’t you answering your phone?

2496
02:22:41.869 --> 02:22:43.536 line:82%
-Get in!
-I didn't hear it ring.

2497
02:23:14.661 --> 02:23:16.744 line:82%
She's trying to get out. Catch her!

2498
02:23:17.119 --> 02:23:18.619 line:82%
How do I get out of here now?

2499
02:23:26.536 --> 02:23:27.744 line:82%
-Lock it!
-Yes.

2500
02:23:29.994 --> 02:23:31.078 line:82%
Send it up!

2501
02:23:31.453 --> 02:23:32.744 line:82%
-Give it to me.
-It's ready!

2502
02:23:35.078 --> 02:23:36.869 line:82%
-Make it quick!
-Okay, okay.

2503
02:23:38.036 --> 02:23:39.786 line:82%
Hey, step on it!

2504
02:23:50.661 --> 02:23:53.953 line:82%
They're tossing me around
like a fidget spinner!

2505
02:23:55.828 --> 02:23:56.994 line:82%
Hold on, hold on.

2506
02:23:57.911 --> 02:23:59.286 line:82%
We are running out of time!

2507
02:23:59.369 --> 02:24:00.869 line:82%
Go faster! Step on it.

2508
02:24:02.661 --> 02:24:04.911 line:82%
Who even designed this seating arrangement?

2509
02:24:08.744 --> 02:24:11.744 line:82%
I would've been better off
joining the circus than this team!

2510
02:24:16.036 --> 02:24:17.786 line:82%
Hey, she's near the screen!

2511
02:24:17.828 --> 02:24:19.161 line:82%
Hey, stop!

2512
02:24:19.661 --> 02:24:21.203 line:82%
Trying to mess with us, old lady?

2513
02:24:21.328 --> 02:24:22.786 line:82%
Go on, catch her! Come on.

2514
02:24:22.828 --> 02:24:24.536 line:82%
You guys can't even catch an old lady?

2515
02:24:26.119 --> 02:24:27.286 line:82%
Grab her!

2516
02:24:30.994 --> 02:24:33.119 line:82%
-Sir, you wait. I'll go check!
-Move aside!

2517
02:24:35.828 --> 02:24:37.828 line:82%
-Catch her! She's running.
-Don't let her escape.

2518
02:24:40.286 --> 02:24:41.661 line:82%
Damn, the big brother is here!

2519
02:24:43.203 --> 02:24:44.411 line:82%
Brother, why are you here?

2520
02:24:44.536 --> 02:24:46.869 line:82%
-Someone has opened the locker.
-No, the locker is safe.

2521
02:24:46.869 --> 02:24:48.203 line:82%
My foot! You idiot!

2522
02:24:48.244 --> 02:24:50.411 line:82%
-Why didn't you answer my call?
-It's a signal problem.

2523
02:24:51.328 --> 02:24:52.328 line:82%
Hey!

2524
02:24:59.828 --> 02:25:01.536 line:82%
You said everything was safe? Look!

2525
02:25:03.286 --> 02:25:04.994 line:82%
Soori, who did this?

2526
02:25:05.119 --> 02:25:06.953 line:82%
I have no idea, sir.
They were all wearing masks.

2527
02:25:08.119 --> 02:25:09.119 line:82%
Oh, god!

2528
02:25:11.578 --> 02:25:12.578 line:82%
Brother!

2529
02:25:13.453 --> 02:25:15.036 line:82%
They took away our entire fortune!

2530
02:25:40.036 --> 02:25:41.828 line:82%
Hey! It's a snake. A snake!

2531
02:25:42.828 --> 02:25:44.244 line:82%
He must still be on the terrace.

2532
02:25:44.328 --> 02:25:45.703 line:82%
There's no way he escaped
with all that money.

2533
02:25:45.786 --> 02:25:47.994 line:82%
Lock down the theatre!
No one gets out!

2534
02:25:48.078 --> 02:25:49.369 line:82%
Let's head to the terrace. Come on!

2535
02:25:51.578 --> 02:25:53.578 line:82%
Everything is gone.
We can't let him get away!

2536
02:25:59.119 --> 02:26:01.036 line:82%
-Shut all the gates.
-Close that door!

2537
02:26:01.203 --> 02:26:03.203 line:82%
-Why are they all running?
-What's happening?

2538
02:26:03.244 --> 02:26:05.078 line:82%
-Everyone, stop!
-Where are you going?

2539
02:26:05.161 --> 02:26:06.744 line:82%
-Amul, close the door!
-Don't let him escape.

2540
02:26:06.786 --> 02:26:08.369 line:82%
-Why are you all running?
-Stop, running!

2541
02:26:08.411 --> 02:26:09.661 line:82%
The plan is a success!

2542
02:26:13.661 --> 02:26:15.286 line:82%
How did this happen?

2543
02:26:17.078 --> 02:26:18.161 line:82%
Hey, no!

2544
02:26:18.411 --> 02:26:19.911 line:82%
Lock the gate!

2545
02:26:25.661 --> 02:26:27.036 line:82%
Hey! Close the main gate.

2546
02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:28.078 line:82%
Lock it!

2547
02:26:28.203 --> 02:26:29.203 line:82%
Hey!

2548
02:26:29.578 --> 02:26:30.578 line:82%
Let's go.

2549
02:26:33.286 --> 02:26:35.286 line:82%
-Stop them!
-Hey, lock the bloody gate.

2550
02:26:35.411 --> 02:26:37.119 line:82%
-What are you even--
-Wait!

2551
02:26:37.203 --> 02:26:38.203 line:82%
Why are you all running?

2552
02:26:38.286 --> 02:26:39.494 line:82%
Stop!

2553
02:26:53.953 --> 02:26:55.744 line:82%
Come, dear.
Did everything go well?

2554
02:26:55.994 --> 02:26:57.411 line:82%
We'll only find out later.

2555
02:26:57.453 --> 02:26:59.161 line:82%
Close the door.

2556
02:27:04.078 --> 02:27:05.911 line:82%
Did he get away with the money?
Or did he get caught?

2557
02:27:05.994 --> 02:27:07.286 line:82%
I’m too anxious to sleep!

2558
02:27:21.203 --> 02:27:22.911 line:82%
-Did you get a call from him?
-Nothing.

2559
02:27:23.078 --> 02:27:24.119 line:82%
Oh, no!

2560
02:27:24.244 --> 02:27:26.744 line:82%
The minister caught Mudiyarasan
and his brothers red-handed.

2561
02:27:34.703 --> 02:27:35.703 line:82%
Hello.

2562
02:27:43.911 --> 02:27:45.911 line:82%
This town is finally free
from their atrocities.

2563
02:27:45.911 --> 02:27:48.494 line:82%
Suji, call Saravanan and check
when he’s coming with the money.

2564
02:27:48.536 --> 02:27:49.744 line:82%
I’ll call him.

2565
02:27:52.286 --> 02:27:53.286 line:82%
Hello--

2566
02:27:53.536 --> 02:27:54.828 line:82%
Why is the call getting cut
after two rings?

2567
02:27:54.869 --> 02:27:55.869 line:82%
Really?

2568
02:27:56.078 --> 02:27:57.078 line:82%
Let me try…

2569
02:28:01.536 --> 02:28:03.119 line:82%
-What happened?
-It’s disconnecting after a single ring.

2570
02:28:03.286 --> 02:28:04.286 line:82%
Is it a network issue,
or is he cutting the call?

2571
02:28:04.328 --> 02:28:06.453 line:82%
Don’t panic. He’ll definitely
answer my call.

2572
02:28:06.536 --> 02:28:07.536 line:82%
He’s our guy.

2573
02:28:10.036 --> 02:28:11.036 line:82%
Hello--

2574
02:28:12.036 --> 02:28:13.244 line:82%
It’s switched off.

2575
02:28:13.536 --> 02:28:14.578 line:82%
So, he escaped?!

2576
02:28:14.619 --> 02:28:16.244 line:82%
-What?!
-He escaped?

2577
02:28:16.536 --> 02:28:19.536 line:82%
I told you not to trust him
with the entire money!

2578
02:28:40.078 --> 02:28:41.411 line:82%
-Mr.Police…
-Huh?

2579
02:28:41.953 --> 02:28:43.619 line:82%
How did he escape with all that money?

2580
02:28:43.661 --> 02:28:45.119 line:82%
How would I know?

2581
02:28:47.119 --> 02:28:48.119 line:82%
Let’s go.

2582
02:28:49.453 --> 02:28:50.619 line:82%
Hey, wait.

2583
02:28:51.411 --> 02:28:52.703 line:82%
Something’s off.

2584
02:28:52.953 --> 02:28:53.953 line:82%
What?

2585
02:28:54.203 --> 02:28:55.828 line:82%
Something is missing.

2586
02:29:09.744 --> 02:29:11.411 line:82%
Damn you!

2587
02:29:32.078 --> 02:29:33.369 line:82%
He played us for fools.

2588
02:29:34.578 --> 02:29:37.744 line:82%
In my 23 years of service,
I’ve never seen a criminal like him.

2589
02:29:37.786 --> 02:29:39.036 line:82%
He fooled all five of us.

2590
02:29:39.453 --> 02:29:40.661 line:82%
It’s eight, not five.

2591
02:29:41.036 --> 02:29:42.369 line:82%
You forgot the three brothers.

2592
02:29:44.578 --> 02:29:46.953 line:82%
I still feel like he'll come back.

But how do we walk out
with so much money?

2625
02:31:36.161 --> 02:31:38.036 line:82%
That's my responsibility.
I'll handle that.

2626
02:31:38.369 --> 02:31:41.453 line:82%
♪ Not every seed will rise ♪

2627
02:31:41.453 --> 02:31:43.786 line:82%
-Agasu, where’s Sujitha?
-Up there.

2628
02:31:47.078 --> 02:31:49.244 line:82%
-Teacher!
-What happened?

2629
02:31:49.578 --> 02:31:50.619 line:82%
He’s a big fraud!

2630
02:31:50.911 --> 02:31:51.911 line:82%
He’ll never come back.

2631
02:31:51.911 --> 02:31:53.786 line:82%
-What are you saying?
-I checked with the department,

2632
02:31:54.161 --> 02:31:55.744 line:82%
and they confirmed that
Saravanan’s story was true.

2633
02:31:56.286 --> 02:31:57.828 line:82%
So, I went to the prison to verify.

2634
02:31:58.578 --> 02:31:59.619 line:82%
But there…

2635
02:32:03.453 --> 02:32:04.494 line:82%
Tell me, sir.

2636
02:32:06.203 --> 02:32:07.703 line:82%
-Saravanan?
-That’s me.

2637
02:32:08.119 --> 02:32:11.453 line:82%
-Madhavi?
-My wife. And you are?

2638
02:32:11.703 --> 02:32:12.828 line:82%
I’m from the department too.

2639
02:32:13.078 --> 02:32:15.369 line:82%
What now? Another round of
questioning and torture?

2640
02:32:15.536 --> 02:32:16.536 line:82%
Go ahead, sir.

2641
02:32:17.078 --> 02:32:19.869 line:82%
My sufferings in jail have hardened me.

2642
02:32:20.494 --> 02:32:23.411 line:82%
My sufferings in jail have hardened me.

2643
02:32:23.828 --> 02:32:26.494 line:82%
Saravanan, you’re a bigger criminal.

2644
02:32:26.828 --> 02:32:28.786 line:82%
Do I really look like one, sir?

2645
02:32:28.828 --> 02:32:30.661 line:82%
The real Saravanan is still in prison.

2646
02:32:30.911 --> 02:32:32.911 line:82%
Our guy befriended him,
gathered all his information,

2647
02:32:32.953 --> 02:32:36.994 line:82%
used his story, and used us to steal
and took off with the money!

2648
02:32:37.744 --> 02:32:39.328 line:82%
He didn’t use us.

2649
02:32:39.953 --> 02:32:44.911 line:82%
He looked for the dumbest people
in town and picked us

2650
02:32:45.536 --> 02:32:48.494 line:82%
That day, when he told his story,
he didn’t even shed a tear.

2651
02:32:48.786 --> 02:32:51.994 line:82%
But we were the ones who cried in chorus!

2652
02:32:52.078 --> 02:32:54.536 line:82%
Who is Sujitha Teacher here?
We have a fridge delivery.

2653
02:32:54.578 --> 02:32:57.453 line:82%
-We didn’t order anything.
-Sir, she's placed the order.

2654
02:32:57.744 --> 02:33:00.286 line:82%
That’s not possible.
We already have a fridge.

2655
02:33:07.661 --> 02:33:10.494 line:82%
Wait… wait. That’s our fridge!
Bring it in.

2656
02:33:24.494 --> 02:33:26.119 line:82%
What the...

2657
02:33:40.744 --> 02:33:42.536 line:82%
Singaram, be steady!

2658
02:33:42.994 --> 02:33:44.369 line:82%
See this, Maths?

2659
02:33:44.536 --> 02:33:49.411 line:82%
I went through disguises, beatings,
insults, and risks for him.

2660
02:33:49.536 --> 02:33:52.203 line:82%
But Saravanan didn’t even bother
sending me a fridge!

2661
02:33:52.286 --> 02:33:53.994 line:82%
-If I see him--
-Who is Singaram Master here?

2662
02:33:54.286 --> 02:33:55.661 line:82%
I'm the one!

2663
02:33:55.661 --> 02:33:56.911 line:82%
-Come down, sir.
-Coming!

2664
02:34:05.453 --> 02:34:07.161 line:82%
Hey, Suresh! Can’t you drive carefully?

2665
02:34:07.244 --> 02:34:07.953 line:82%
-Amuldoss.
-Huh?

2666
02:34:08.078 --> 02:34:09.286 line:82%
You’ve got a parcel.

2667
02:34:09.453 --> 02:34:11.244 line:82%
Pattasamy, bro, you’ve got a parcel.

2668
02:34:11.953 --> 02:34:12.953 line:82%
For me?!

2669
02:34:15.661 --> 02:34:17.744 line:82%
Honey, did we get any parcel?

2670
02:34:39.536 --> 02:34:40.453 line:82%
My god!

2671
02:34:40.494 --> 02:34:41.828 line:82%
Our days of suffering have come to an end.

2672
02:34:57.744 --> 02:34:59.536 line:82%
My god, you gave me the money!

2673
02:35:03.244 --> 02:35:06.203 line:82%
Hello, sir.
Thank you for bailing me out.

2674
02:35:06.411 --> 02:35:10.036 line:82%
Some unknown person sent me
the money order for your bail.

2675
02:35:10.328 --> 02:35:12.453 line:82%
-He also sent you a gift.
-For me?

2676
02:35:46.703 --> 02:35:47.953 line:82%
-Hello.
-Hello, Saravanan.

2677
02:35:48.036 --> 02:35:51.119 line:82%
A casino owner in Goa has
200 crores of black money stashed.

2678
02:35:51.328 --> 02:35:52.369 line:82%
What’s the plan?

2679
02:35:52.453 --> 02:35:54.328 line:82%
The Gangers are in holiday mood.

2680
02:35:54.453 --> 02:35:56.203 line:82%
I’ll call you when they’re ready.

2681
02:35:56.619 --> 02:35:57.869 line:82%
Till then, bye.

2682
02:36:12.411 --> 02:36:13.744 line:82%
I don't have the money!

2683
02:36:14.703 --> 02:36:16.494 line:82%
The money has to be on
the theatre's terrace.

2684
02:36:17.536 --> 02:36:19.619 line:82%
There's no way he escaped
with all of it!

2685
02:36:19.661 --> 02:36:21.494 line:82%
How long will you keep repeating that lie?

2686
02:36:21.578 --> 02:36:22.911 line:82%
We've searched everywhere.

2687
02:36:22.953 --> 02:36:24.453 line:82%
Tell me the truth, you scoundrel!

2688
02:36:27.119 --> 02:36:29.494 line:82%
A FEW DAYS LATER

2689
02:36:33.328 --> 02:36:36.119 line:82%
-Who gave you food?
-So, we're starving today too?

2690
02:36:38.828 --> 02:36:41.494 line:82%
You fooled me as family!

2691
02:36:41.536 --> 02:36:43.244 line:82%
Break their legs first.

2692
02:36:44.119 --> 02:36:46.536 line:82%
A FEW WEEKS LATER

2693
02:36:59.244 --> 02:37:02.036 line:82%
A FEW MONTHS LATER

2694
02:37:18.203 --> 02:37:20.369 line:82%
I might let everything else go...

2695
02:37:20.703 --> 02:37:22.453 line:82%
but you killed that innocent girl!

2696
02:37:22.703 --> 02:37:24.619 line:82%
I'll never forgive you!
