WEBVTT

00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:39.816
Protect His Majesty!

00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:40.775
Yes.

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:58.209
Retreat!

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.578
Is that you?

00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:47.342
You're here to assassinate me.

00:02:47.343 --> 00:02:50.345
You're a Han,
yet you rule as a Manchu.

00:02:50.346 --> 00:02:53.223
You will betray your people no more.

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:06.111
If only I could be rid of these dreams.

00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:07.904
Silence.

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:10.198
Send for the assassin, right away.

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.801
Sir, can I show you some weapons?

00:03:29.802 --> 00:03:31.219
No.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.681
Well, then, how can I help?

00:03:39.103 --> 00:03:41.479
You may help my master.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.523
He has trouble sleeping.

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:47.986
Then he should see a doctor,
not a blacksmith.

00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:50.613
A doctor won't help.

00:03:50.614 --> 00:03:56.327
My master said
we must kill the dream demon.

00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:59.497
That is the only way.

00:03:59.498 --> 00:04:01.791
What is the name of your master?

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:05.628
His name is Qianlong,
the Manchu emperor.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.966
Last week, I killed a member
of the Red Flower Society.

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:11.801
You did what?

00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:13.803
You killed one of our brothers.

00:04:13.804 --> 00:04:16.723
When he died, he gave a confession

00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:22.061
that a certain ironsmith carries with him
a list of names.

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:27.609
Yes, but you're never going to see it
because you're going to die now.

00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:30.278
I'm ready.

00:04:48.672 --> 00:04:51.591
Now I must find the others.

00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:21.788
Did you know that Tiger Lu
is sponsoring the sports competition?

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.164
Where does he get the money?

00:05:23.165 --> 00:05:25.041
He used to be a thief.

00:05:25.042 --> 00:05:26.501
At least that's what I heard.

00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:29.003
That's right.
He's buying all the land.

00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:31.506
In six months, he'll own half the village

00:05:31.507 --> 00:05:35.093
unless we can find a way to stop
all this incredible insanity.

00:05:35.094 --> 00:05:36.886
I agree with you,

00:05:36.887 --> 00:05:39.722
but Tiger Lu is in league
with the Mandarin.

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:40.932
There's not much we can do.

00:05:40.933 --> 00:05:42.392
When a man has that much money,

00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:43.768
he can get away with almost anything.

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:46.271
Why do they all seem to hate my father?

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:48.731
Because he's a rich man.

00:05:48.732 --> 00:05:50.984
Do they know who we are?

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:53.528
I don't think so,
but we should get going.

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.614
Hey, look at her. She's beautiful.

00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:58.116
Yeah. Let's go.

00:06:00.244 --> 00:06:01.452
Oh, look.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.246
I think the race is about to start.

00:06:03.247 --> 00:06:04.372
Forget about the race.

00:06:04.373 --> 00:06:05.790
Your father's waiting.

00:06:05.791 --> 00:06:07.250
Hey, hey. You all alone?

00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.003
- Let me go.
- Let my mistress pass.

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:11.629
Hey, what's the rush?

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.090
- Didn't I tell you?
- She's pretty.

00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:17.093
Hey, stop bothering me now
or I'll tell my father.

00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:19.345
Whoa. Sure.

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:21.139
Let's go find him. Come on.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.391
Hey, don't touch my sister.

00:06:23.392 --> 00:06:24.475
Leave her alone.

00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:28.104
She's not your sister.

00:06:28.105 --> 00:06:29.230
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:31.107
I know him. That's Fong Sai Yuk.

00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:33.192
And I know you, too.

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:35.069
So why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.239
How about if we start with you?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.117
I'm ready.

00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:42.994
Better watch yourself. He's dangerous.

00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:44.245
Go get him.

00:06:44.246 --> 00:06:45.455
- Come on, I'm ready.
- Let's take him.

00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:47.832
Hey! What's going on?

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:49.417
You got some kind of problem?

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:52.670
Officer, leave him alone.

00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.298
Okay, tell me what this is about.

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:56.716
What's going on?

00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:58.384
Ask him about it.

00:06:59.678 --> 00:07:01.929
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.265
Stop this nonsense
or go to jail right now.

00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:06.351
- I'm sorry.
- We're very sorry. Very sorry.

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:07.518
- Yes, of course.
- That's enough.

00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:09.896
- Yes, of course.
- Good-bye, sir. Good-bye.

00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:11.230
- Sorry.
- Good-bye.

00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:12.315
Yeah, right.

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:16.152
Hey, wise guy.

00:07:16.153 --> 00:07:17.528
We're not done yet.

00:07:17.696 --> 00:07:18.821
What do you say?

00:07:18.822 --> 00:07:20.365
Meet me on the race track.

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:22.325
We'll see who's a man.

00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:23.951
You'll win.

00:07:23.952 --> 00:07:26.329
I can already see him sweat.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.413
Right?

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:29.165
Better not.

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:31.084
Last year he took first prize.

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:32.168
So what?

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.212
Sai Yuk knows kung fu.

00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:36.881
What's the matter? He's afraid.

00:07:36.882 --> 00:07:38.549
What? He can beat you.

00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:40.760
Right, brother?

00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:42.595
Let's do it.

00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:45.431
6 meters.

00:07:46.475 --> 00:07:48.559
Next up, last year's champion,

00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:50.770
Yao Chen Chi.

00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:55.817
8 1/2 meters.

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:58.820
A new record!

00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:02.198
Our next competitor is a new contestant.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:05.284
His name is Fong Sai Yuk.

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:14.961
What was that?

00:08:18.382 --> 00:08:20.258
Hey, there, little brother.

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:21.551
What are you doing?

00:08:21.552 --> 00:08:24.262
Why, I could have crushed you.

00:08:32.688 --> 00:08:34.063
He cleared the pit!

00:08:34.064 --> 00:08:35.523
A new world record!

00:08:35.524 --> 00:08:38.067
I knew he'd win.

00:08:38.068 --> 00:08:41.070
So, how'd you like the ride?

00:08:42.364 --> 00:08:46.868
All right, let's see
how fast you are in the relay.

00:08:48.537 --> 00:08:50.288
Sai, what do we do?

00:08:50.289 --> 00:08:52.206
- There's only three of us.
- It's for four men.

00:08:53.917 --> 00:08:55.543
Four?

00:09:00.424 --> 00:09:02.300
Miss, can you help us?

00:09:02.301 --> 00:09:05.511
The relay race, it's for four people.

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:06.929
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.098
But I don't run.

00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:12.310
I bet you're faster than an ant.

00:09:12.311 --> 00:09:13.478
Probably.

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:15.354
Let's go then. Come on.

00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:20.860
You, go first.

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:21.986
Let me start.

00:09:21.987 --> 00:09:23.112
Why not?

00:09:23.113 --> 00:09:25.448
Runners, take your mark.

00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:27.116
Ready? Go!

00:09:27.117 --> 00:09:28.493
Run! Go!

00:09:28.494 --> 00:09:30.119
- Yes! Run!
- Run!

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.120
- Fast!
- Run!

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.126
- Run, run, run!
- Yeah! Great! Faster!

00:09:37.127 --> 00:09:38.336
- Come on!
- Move it! Move it!

00:09:38.337 --> 00:09:40.463
- Come on, Bo! Hurry!
- Let's go!

00:09:40.464 --> 00:09:41.589
Come on!

00:09:49.932 --> 00:09:52.850
Come on! Come on!

00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:54.477
Your turn.

00:09:54.478 --> 00:09:56.604
- I can't.
- Run like the wind. Go!

00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:02.360
Quick! Stand up!

00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:03.903
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:04.946
Come on!

00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:12.954
- Get going!
- Run faster!

00:10:12.955 --> 00:10:14.497
What's the matter?
You're too slow...

00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:17.291
Faster! Come on, faster!

00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:29.136
You were great.

00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:35.977
He's going to win it.

00:10:49.658 --> 00:10:51.826
- All right! Come on!
- Faster!

00:10:51.827 --> 00:10:53.369
Faster!

00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:09.594
He's winning. Keep going!

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:23.774
- You're the winner!
- You did it!

00:11:23.942 --> 00:11:25.902
We won the championships!

00:11:34.536 --> 00:11:36.329
Hey, here's the medal we won.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.455
I thought that you might like it.

00:11:38.957 --> 00:11:40.166
Don't you like it?

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:42.585
No. It's from Lu. Forget it.

00:11:42.586 --> 00:11:44.587
What's your name?

00:11:44.588 --> 00:11:45.713
It's Ling.

00:11:46.965 --> 00:11:49.467
- Hey, you! That's not fair!
- Please, the race is over.

00:11:49.468 --> 00:11:51.260
Yeah, but the fight isn't.

00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:52.470
Get them.

00:12:25.337 --> 00:12:27.046
Who else wants to fight?

00:12:53.865 --> 00:12:55.199
Want some more?

00:12:57.786 --> 00:13:00.413
- Thank you, all of you.
- You're not so tough, are you?

00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:02.123
- Break it up. Break it up.
- Big man.

00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:03.749
All right, what's the fight about?

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.252
See? All of them
were fighting, not us.

00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:07.628
We'll see about that.

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:09.547
- Come on, lock them up.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:09.548 --> 00:13:10.965
Okay, let's round them up.

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:12.800
- What?
- Same for you.

00:13:12.801 --> 00:13:14.301
Let's go.

00:13:14.302 --> 00:13:15.428
Come on, they started it.

00:13:18.724 --> 00:13:20.891
Come on, let's go.

00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:24.812
Damn it!

00:13:24.813 --> 00:13:26.731
He's a snake!

00:13:26.732 --> 00:13:30.151
The nerve of that peasant
refusing to sell me his land.

00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:33.404
After I bought the adjoining property.

00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:34.697
No matter.

00:13:34.698 --> 00:13:35.906
I control the water.

00:13:36.074 --> 00:13:38.409
Without my stream,
it is a worthless property.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.411
We'll put up a damn, then he'll sell.

00:13:40.412 --> 00:13:41.996
Yes, sir.

00:13:41.997 --> 00:13:43.914
Your Highness, changing the stream

00:13:44.082 --> 00:13:46.625
is going to put you
in even deeper water.

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:49.503
The people must learn to respect me.

00:13:49.504 --> 00:13:54.800
They must have respect,
but you know what is said.

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.260
When the lion is hungry,

00:13:56.261 --> 00:14:00.681
he must go into the forest
to entice home his prey.

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:04.435
Get these people to trust you,

00:14:04.436 --> 00:14:08.939
and then you should hold
a kung fu tournament.

00:14:09.107 --> 00:14:11.609
The winner will earn
your daughter's hand in marriage.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.153
Is this really necessary?

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.363
Maybe she won't want to marry the winner.

00:14:16.364 --> 00:14:19.200
Can't you see what I'm getting at?

00:14:19.201 --> 00:14:21.535
It's the only way to do this right.

00:14:21.536 --> 00:14:23.454
You just have to show them.

00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:25.873
You can be like a father to them.

00:14:25.874 --> 00:14:28.834
So, if your daughter
marries one of them,

00:14:28.835 --> 00:14:31.879
the rest of them
will give you what you want.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.589
Damn it!

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.758
Don't you think I know that?

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:36.967
What are we waiting for?

00:14:37.135 --> 00:14:38.260
You're right.

00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:39.762
Great idea.

00:14:39.763 --> 00:14:41.388
Tell everyone.

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:42.848
Prepare the tournament.

00:14:45.602 --> 00:14:48.437
Sai Yuk, we can't tell anyone
we spent the day in jail.

00:14:48.438 --> 00:14:49.605
Don't worry.

00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:51.232
Sing's right. My parents will be mad.

00:14:51.233 --> 00:14:52.983
Relax. I gave them false names.

00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:55.069
You're Yin Quai,
and you're Lao Chun.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.654
- What about you?
- What about you?

00:14:56.655 --> 00:14:58.239
I am Wong Jing.

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:01.951
Right?

00:15:01.952 --> 00:15:04.161
I have to go home now.

00:15:04.162 --> 00:15:05.496
My mother is waiting for me.

00:15:05.497 --> 00:15:06.705
See you tomorrow.

00:15:09.835 --> 00:15:11.001
Look at that there.

00:15:11.002 --> 00:15:12.086
It's beautiful.

00:15:12.087 --> 00:15:15.756
I love her hairstyle.

00:15:15.757 --> 00:15:18.384
And those dark glasses are charming.

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:24.557
I won't be able to see a thing,

00:15:24.558 --> 00:15:26.267
but I bet I'll look great.

00:15:28.645 --> 00:15:30.938
I wonder how I look.

00:15:33.775 --> 00:15:35.109
Hello there.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.528
You scared me.

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:38.654
So sorry.

00:15:38.655 --> 00:15:41.365
It's just... your beauty,
it distracted me.

00:15:41.366 --> 00:15:42.533
Oh, my.

00:15:42.534 --> 00:15:46.829
And your glasses are so unusual.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.416
Could you show me this fabric?

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:51.500
Right here.

00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:54.545
- That one?
- Yes.

00:15:54.546 --> 00:15:57.047
What a cheapskate.

00:15:57.215 --> 00:15:59.717
Here. That's the one.

00:15:59.718 --> 00:16:00.801
I've got it.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.387
How long?

00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:05.055
Just a little bit.

00:16:05.223 --> 00:16:07.057
Right there.

00:16:07.225 --> 00:16:08.267
Right about there.

00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:09.852
- There?
- About... Yes.

00:16:09.853 --> 00:16:11.103
- There?
- Right... That's right.

00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:12.313
- That short?
- Yes, that's about right.

00:16:12.314 --> 00:16:13.397
Yeah.

00:16:13.398 --> 00:16:14.982
It sure is small.

00:16:20.989 --> 00:16:22.072
Wait!

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.824
- He's a thief!
- You're late.

00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:25.075
Mom, I'm serious.

00:16:25.076 --> 00:16:26.160
- He's stealing.
- Hey, what's going on?

00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:27.411
Shut up.

00:16:27.412 --> 00:16:28.495
- Mom.
- My money's good.

00:16:28.496 --> 00:16:30.039
Hey, you look great.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.081
Get to work, now.

00:16:31.249 --> 00:16:32.875
Okay.

00:16:32.876 --> 00:16:34.001
Is he your son?

00:16:34.002 --> 00:16:35.794
Chinese boys today.

00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:36.879
Is this my fabric?

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.256
You're not blind. You can see.

00:16:39.257 --> 00:16:40.633
Of course I can.

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:42.259
How do you suppose I hit you?

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.886
Well, I'd better get going.

00:16:43.887 --> 00:16:44.929
Bye!

00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:52.686
Here.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.985
Mom. Are you an assassin?

00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:01.111
He's okay.

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:02.404
The fruit's not ripe.

00:17:02.405 --> 00:17:03.864
Really?

00:17:03.865 --> 00:17:05.199
See?

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.450
It barely pierced the apple.

00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:10.412
Easy. Easy. Easy.

00:17:10.413 --> 00:17:12.957
Whoa. 3 inches.

00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.875
It almost went through all the way.

00:17:14.876 --> 00:17:15.834
I must be slipping.

00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:19.588
She's crazy.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.131
Okay, let's go home.

00:17:21.132 --> 00:17:22.967
Mom, it's the second time this week.

00:17:22.968 --> 00:17:24.593
This will get us in trouble.

00:17:24.594 --> 00:17:27.179
Not if we don't tell your father, it won't.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.474
Hey, Ma, I met a beautiful girl today.

00:17:30.475 --> 00:17:32.601
- She's great.
- Really?

00:17:32.602 --> 00:17:33.686
What eyes.

00:17:33.687 --> 00:17:34.770
Maybe we'll take tomorrow off.

00:17:34.771 --> 00:17:36.313
Now I'm in trouble.

00:17:39.901 --> 00:17:41.902
Young Master, I have bad news.

00:17:41.903 --> 00:17:43.612
The house is full of people.

00:17:43.613 --> 00:17:44.738
Who are they?

00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:47.408
It's the Mandarin
and all of his emissaries.

00:17:47.409 --> 00:17:49.368
You're right, that is bad news.

00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:50.452
What's the matter?

00:17:50.453 --> 00:17:52.871
Well, I was in a fight today.

00:17:52.872 --> 00:17:55.624
Fine. Let me do the talking.

00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:59.253
Esteemed Governor,
wise councilmen,

00:17:59.254 --> 00:18:01.046
I'll settle this matter.

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:03.465
Mr. Fong, you are very honorable.

00:18:03.466 --> 00:18:04.800
I'm quite ashamed.

00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:07.594
I think they both need to be punished.

00:18:07.595 --> 00:18:10.723
I assure you,
I'll take care of this matter.

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:13.267
What a wonderful surprise.

00:18:13.268 --> 00:18:16.687
Most esteemed Governor
and loyal friends.

00:18:16.688 --> 00:18:18.981
Let me prepare a meal
in honor of your presence.

00:18:18.982 --> 00:18:21.233
Such dishonor.

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:23.861
Today you almost killed our customer.

00:18:23.862 --> 00:18:26.447
- What?
- That's right.

00:18:26.448 --> 00:18:28.198
And her swordplay scared my wife

00:18:28.366 --> 00:18:30.159
- and made her cry.
- He's right.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.746
And that cloth my wife bought,
it fell apart before she got home.

00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:35.664
- Yeah!
- And she calls me an old goat.

00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:38.500
- Yes! It's true!
- That's right!

00:18:38.501 --> 00:18:40.002
So explain yourself.

00:18:40.003 --> 00:18:42.087
You'll hit me even if I do.

00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:43.839
Macu, a fresh stick.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.758
I'm ready.

00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:54.600
Please, master.

00:18:55.894 --> 00:18:58.479
So sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry.

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.279
Please, Dad, no!

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.739
Not Mom.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.782
Hit me.

00:19:12.911 --> 00:19:14.536
He loves you, doesn't he?

00:19:14.537 --> 00:19:16.789
Is this the home of Fong Sai Yuk?

00:19:21.086 --> 00:19:22.628
Yep, that's him.

00:19:22.629 --> 00:19:23.712
Now arrest him.

00:19:23.713 --> 00:19:24.880
What's going on?

00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:26.882
Today I arrested him for fighting.

00:19:26.883 --> 00:19:28.967
At the jailhouse
he gave me a false name.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.762
You lying little...

00:19:36.518 --> 00:19:38.227
That hurts.

00:19:38.228 --> 00:19:41.855
It would have been a lot worse
if I hadn't shielded you.

00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:44.233
Ma, you're so good at kung fu.

00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:46.276
Why do you let him
beat you up like that?

00:19:46.277 --> 00:19:48.821
Your father's pride
is bigger than mine.

00:19:48.822 --> 00:19:51.824
And besides,
he's always careful not to hurt me.

00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:54.910
Whoa! What did I do now?

00:19:54.911 --> 00:19:57.079
Good night.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.042
Good night, Dad.

00:20:03.461 --> 00:20:06.088
He learns his fighting from you.

00:20:06.089 --> 00:20:08.507
He's not a boy anymore.

00:20:08.508 --> 00:20:11.885
It's time he learned
to stay out of trouble.

00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:15.222
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

00:20:18.518 --> 00:20:24.648
All you care about is business
and the idle gossip of our neighbors.

00:20:24.649 --> 00:20:26.775
I have feelings, too.

00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:29.319
Every day is the same.

00:20:29.487 --> 00:20:32.322
You don't care about me.

00:20:32.323 --> 00:20:35.117
And you're always late for dinner.

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:37.911
What's the matter?

00:20:37.912 --> 00:20:38.996
Forget it.

00:20:38.997 --> 00:20:40.664
I need you.

00:20:40.665 --> 00:20:43.083
No, you don't. You don't mean it.

00:20:45.837 --> 00:20:50.382
And the little bird flew away...

00:20:50.383 --> 00:20:53.927
...and left her poor lover alone.

00:20:56.181 --> 00:21:01.351
And his heart was broken,
for only she could make him happy.

00:21:01.519 --> 00:21:06.231
His poetry makes me tingle all over.

00:21:07.984 --> 00:21:10.569
Are you still angry with me?

00:21:12.989 --> 00:21:15.032
Did you like my poem?

00:21:15.033 --> 00:21:16.867
Yeah.

00:21:16.868 --> 00:21:18.368
Then follow me.

00:21:18.536 --> 00:21:21.705
It's time for bed.

00:21:21.706 --> 00:21:23.332
All right.

00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:37.387
What's going on over there?

00:21:38.932 --> 00:21:40.015
What does it say?

00:21:40.016 --> 00:21:42.392
Look! It's starting.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.645
Look! Get that.

00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:47.189
Incredible!

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.025
Although I am a newcomer here,

00:21:50.026 --> 00:21:53.946
I want you to know that Tiger
is just like all of you.

00:21:53.947 --> 00:21:57.699
So I have decided to hold
a kung fu competition

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.201
to find a son-in-law.

00:21:59.202 --> 00:22:03.914
Whoever can beat my wife
can marry my beautiful daughter.

00:22:03.915 --> 00:22:08.585
As soon as the contestant's feet
touch the ground, the fight is over.

00:22:08.586 --> 00:22:10.504
Oh, look, she's unhappy.

00:22:10.505 --> 00:22:15.634
And now meet my wife, Siu Wan.

00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:17.135
Look!

00:22:27.438 --> 00:22:31.233
When I marry her, and you'll see,
we'll never sleep.

00:22:31.234 --> 00:22:32.526
Come on, you won't win.

00:22:32.527 --> 00:22:33.819
You just watch me.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.529
- Okay, let's go sign up.
- I want to sign up.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.906
- Come on.
- Let's go.

00:22:37.907 --> 00:22:39.408
Come on, hurry up.

00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:41.451
- Where's Sai Yuk?
- He's studying at home.

00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:42.828
Come on, let's go.

00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:43.996
Hey, out of our way!

00:22:43.997 --> 00:22:45.414
Come on, move it!

00:22:45.415 --> 00:22:46.915
Put it in the back of the wagon.

00:22:46.916 --> 00:22:48.166
Where's Fong?

00:22:48.167 --> 00:22:50.377
He's inside studying.

00:22:50.378 --> 00:22:52.254
- I'll be back later.
- Don't be long.

00:22:52.255 --> 00:22:56.425
"After the rain, the flowers will fall

00:22:56.426 --> 00:22:58.927
from the sky above..."

00:22:58.928 --> 00:23:00.887
Hey, who is it?

00:23:02.515 --> 00:23:04.641
- They're having a kung fu fight.
- For sure you'll win.

00:23:04.642 --> 00:23:06.059
Come on. You must hurry.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.186
How's your studying going, Sai Yuk?

00:23:12.442 --> 00:23:15.444
"...the mountaintop.

00:23:15.445 --> 00:23:17.946
"The cherry blossoms

00:23:17.947 --> 00:23:21.241
are falling from the..."

00:23:21.242 --> 00:23:22.451
Dad.

00:23:22.452 --> 00:23:25.454
Sai Yuk, sit down.

00:23:25.455 --> 00:23:26.538
I must go.

00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:30.125
About how long? Why?

00:23:30.126 --> 00:23:33.962
- Please, son, keep studying.
- Okay.

00:23:33.963 --> 00:23:36.923
Good. I'll return shortly.

00:23:40.136 --> 00:23:42.804
Guys, he's gone.

00:23:42.805 --> 00:23:44.097
What about the fight?

00:23:44.098 --> 00:23:45.974
It's a kung fu battle for Lu's daughter.

00:23:45.975 --> 00:23:47.517
- The winner gets to marry her.
- Really?

00:23:47.685 --> 00:23:50.520
Yeah. Lu says that his wife's
the best fighter in Canton.

00:23:50.688 --> 00:23:51.897
He said that?

00:23:51.898 --> 00:23:53.357
I'm about to surprise him.

00:23:53.358 --> 00:23:54.524
Master, please.

00:23:54.692 --> 00:23:57.527
Why are you worried about
a kung fu competition?

00:23:57.695 --> 00:23:59.029
Come on.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.781
Yeah, Fong. You can beat anyone.

00:24:00.782 --> 00:24:03.950
Master, your father's
coming to say good-bye.

00:24:05.286 --> 00:24:07.245
Here, put this on.

00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:08.497
He'll think you're me.

00:24:08.498 --> 00:24:10.707
I got to go.

00:24:10.708 --> 00:24:15.420
But, Master, I'm much too fat!

00:24:33.147 --> 00:24:35.232
- Master, I have some bad news.
- What's that?

00:24:35.233 --> 00:24:37.859
Ting Ting his disappeared.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.028
What? No!

00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:42.197
Who's next? Come on.

00:24:42.198 --> 00:24:45.367
Damn it, man! Crap.

00:24:48.329 --> 00:24:50.747
You'll do. Come here.

00:24:50.748 --> 00:24:53.125
Our first challenger has been defeated.

00:24:53.126 --> 00:24:55.544
Will the second challenger
please come forward?

00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:56.878
Stop looking.

00:24:56.879 --> 00:24:58.255
What?

00:24:58.256 --> 00:24:59.881
What an idea.

00:24:59.882 --> 00:25:01.174
Patience, sir.

00:25:01.175 --> 00:25:02.718
You'll see.

00:25:10.059 --> 00:25:13.061
Hey. You okay?

00:25:13.062 --> 00:25:14.813
She can't be that good.

00:25:14.814 --> 00:25:16.898
She fights like a man.

00:25:16.899 --> 00:25:19.192
I guess you'll find yourself
in a single bed.

00:25:21.362 --> 00:25:23.572
Hey, people, come on.

00:25:23.573 --> 00:25:25.073
Isn't there one of you here

00:25:25.074 --> 00:25:27.701
who can beat
my beautiful wife Siu Wan?

00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:30.287
There are no heroes left in Canton.

00:25:30.288 --> 00:25:32.080
Hey, that's what you think.

00:25:32.081 --> 00:25:34.416
- I'll win your prize.
- What's your name?

00:25:34.417 --> 00:25:37.461
What's my name?

00:25:37.462 --> 00:25:39.713
Just ask anyone here.

00:25:39.714 --> 00:25:41.173
They'll tell you my name.

00:25:41.174 --> 00:25:42.215
Fong Sai Yuk.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.803
Siu Wan, take him now!

00:25:52.101 --> 00:25:54.227
- Are you the prize?
- Of course not.

00:25:54.228 --> 00:25:55.312
She's over there.

00:25:55.313 --> 00:25:56.646
Let's have a look-see.

00:27:02.505 --> 00:27:05.340
Look, madam, both feet
are off the ground. See?

00:27:11.764 --> 00:27:13.849
I think we have a winner.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.322
Get ready.

00:27:29.323 --> 00:27:30.699
I think I'm going to need some help.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.368
Get her off!

00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:34.452
Get off!

00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:36.079
Don't worry. I can help.

00:28:10.364 --> 00:28:11.740
Come on. Stop joking.

00:28:38.392 --> 00:28:39.517
Get ready.

00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:41.811
Hold on tight.

00:28:41.812 --> 00:28:43.480
Come on! Someone help her!

00:28:45.566 --> 00:28:49.611
Hey, they're helping her.

00:28:49.612 --> 00:28:51.780
Aw, come on.

00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:53.865
I'm about to win.

00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:01.873
Now, wait. All right, now.

00:29:01.874 --> 00:29:03.959
Whoa, hold it. Hang on.

00:29:21.143 --> 00:29:22.727
He's going to fall.

00:29:30.653 --> 00:29:32.946
She's got imagination.

00:29:32.947 --> 00:29:36.825
Hey, some of these people
are on our side.

00:29:38.661 --> 00:29:40.662
Well, you feel okay?

00:29:40.663 --> 00:29:41.788
Just great. Come on.

00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:43.498
I'm behind you. Beat her.

00:29:43.499 --> 00:29:45.875
You've fought well. Now it's my turn.

00:29:46.043 --> 00:29:48.253
Okay. It's about time
you landed on your head.

00:29:48.254 --> 00:29:49.337
Get ready.

00:29:49.338 --> 00:29:51.047
Yeah!

00:29:51.048 --> 00:29:52.382
Take him, Siu Wan.

00:30:05.521 --> 00:30:08.064
Come on, you're making me too tired.

00:30:08.065 --> 00:30:10.233
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.535
Hey! That hurts!

00:30:20.536 --> 00:30:21.995
Watch it, Bo.

00:30:21.996 --> 00:30:23.913
I'm trying.

00:30:23.914 --> 00:30:24.914
She's safe.

00:30:25.082 --> 00:30:26.249
Come on.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.876
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:31:01.368 --> 00:31:02.869
Bo, catch me!

00:31:04.914 --> 00:31:06.498
Your feet haven't
touched the ground, Fong.

00:31:06.499 --> 00:31:08.124
I'm going to finish
this woman off right now.

00:31:26.769 --> 00:31:28.812
She's falling!

00:31:36.403 --> 00:31:37.779
Sai Yuk, are you okay?

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.197
Why did you catch her?

00:31:39.198 --> 00:31:40.990
Did you get a look at the daughter?

00:31:40.991 --> 00:31:42.283
Come on, let's go.

00:31:42.284 --> 00:31:43.618
What about the girl?

00:31:43.619 --> 00:31:45.870
Don't worry. I'll be back.

00:31:45.871 --> 00:31:47.956
And next time, I'll win.

00:31:47.957 --> 00:31:51.084
Young man, wait!

00:31:51.085 --> 00:31:52.627
Damn it!

00:31:52.628 --> 00:31:56.714
Mom, Fong Sai Yuk just lost
a kung fu match to a woman.

00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:58.550
Ah, your boy.

00:31:58.551 --> 00:32:00.176
But no one beats him in fights.

00:32:00.177 --> 00:32:01.594
He never loses.

00:32:02.805 --> 00:32:05.765
It's those damn Lus.

00:32:07.476 --> 00:32:09.602
All right, who's next?

00:32:09.603 --> 00:32:13.189
Anyone else interested?

00:32:14.483 --> 00:32:16.484
Speak up. Come on, let's go.

00:32:19.947 --> 00:32:22.031
Wait a minute.

00:32:22.032 --> 00:32:25.493
Here's a wager that says
I can win this fight.

00:32:25.494 --> 00:32:28.246
Lend me your backs and I'll win for us all.

00:32:28.247 --> 00:32:30.165
I am your...

00:32:32.334 --> 00:32:33.293
hero.

00:32:36.422 --> 00:32:38.423
You seem very confident.

00:32:38.424 --> 00:32:40.466
And you are quite beautiful.

00:32:40.467 --> 00:32:43.553
Save your flirting
and get on with the show.

00:32:47.016 --> 00:32:49.058
So, how about it?

00:32:49.226 --> 00:32:50.894
Let me see.

00:32:52.229 --> 00:32:53.813
Should we?

00:32:53.814 --> 00:32:55.648
Let's get something straight.

00:32:55.649 --> 00:32:57.150
I didn't come here to play a game.

00:32:57.151 --> 00:32:58.902
Okay.

00:33:03.365 --> 00:33:05.158
I'm Fong Tai Yuk.

00:33:05.159 --> 00:33:06.618
Braggart.

00:33:06.619 --> 00:33:08.536
Humility doesn't run in your family.

00:33:08.537 --> 00:33:11.039
Seems to be a big problem
in your family.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.373
Come on, let's get going.

00:33:12.374 --> 00:33:14.292
Your husband's a fool.

00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:23.384
You have very good footwork.

00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.345
Only the best.

00:33:57.544 --> 00:33:59.837
Afraid that I might bite?

00:34:02.424 --> 00:34:03.466
Don't drop me.

00:34:04.885 --> 00:34:06.135
I can't hold you forever.

00:34:06.303 --> 00:34:08.137
Do you give up?

00:34:08.305 --> 00:34:11.140
If you do, I'll save your life.

00:34:11.141 --> 00:34:12.392
Hang on.

00:34:12.393 --> 00:34:13.768
I've won!

00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:15.061
Look out!

00:34:17.106 --> 00:34:20.066
Ladies first!

00:34:30.327 --> 00:34:31.869
It's over.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:32.829
You're on the ground now.

00:34:34.957 --> 00:34:36.082
That wasn't bad.

00:34:36.083 --> 00:34:38.751
It was perfect.

00:34:38.752 --> 00:34:40.128
Release her!

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.797
Now let's get on with the ceremony.

00:34:42.798 --> 00:34:45.633
Thank you. Thank you.

00:34:45.634 --> 00:34:47.885
You make the Fong family very happy.

00:34:47.886 --> 00:34:49.512
Ah, now for your reward.

00:34:51.348 --> 00:34:53.224
I want nothing.

00:34:53.225 --> 00:34:55.184
But my daughter needs a husband.

00:34:55.352 --> 00:34:56.978
So get another.

00:34:56.979 --> 00:34:58.688
I came to fight.

00:34:58.689 --> 00:35:02.025
Hey, what's your story?

00:35:02.026 --> 00:35:04.068
Good-bye.

00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:05.445
Don't worry.

00:35:05.446 --> 00:35:06.696
You will change your mind.

00:35:16.498 --> 00:35:19.709
- Who are you?
- I'm your mother, Sai Yuk.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:22.754
Mom, wow.

00:35:22.755 --> 00:35:24.172
You really look like a man.

00:35:24.173 --> 00:35:26.966
Yeah, and I just won Tiger Lu's daughter's
hand in marriage.

00:35:26.967 --> 00:35:29.177
- Does Dad know?
- No.

00:35:29.178 --> 00:35:31.220
Then why are you acting so worried?

00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:33.848
Because Tiger Lu is going
to force me to marry her.

00:35:33.849 --> 00:35:35.224
I've got to get going.

00:35:35.392 --> 00:35:37.518
But, Mom, it'll be funny.

00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:38.603
Come on.

00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:39.979
- Please.
- Here comes Tiger Lu!

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.773
It's him. Let's escape.

00:35:41.774 --> 00:35:42.857
We'd better not.

00:35:42.858 --> 00:35:44.233
- Plan B?
- Yeah.

00:35:51.825 --> 00:35:54.577
Tai Yuk, it's about time.

00:35:54.578 --> 00:35:57.038
Find him.

00:35:57.039 --> 00:35:59.082
What's wrong with you?

00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:05.797
Where are you?

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.091
Go find him!

00:36:08.092 --> 00:36:09.258
We're going this way.

00:36:09.426 --> 00:36:11.719
- Come with me.
- Look over there.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.678
Come here.

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:19.185
Don't look.

00:36:19.186 --> 00:36:20.478
What's the matter?

00:36:23.065 --> 00:36:24.273
Why are you crying?

00:36:24.441 --> 00:36:25.775
He's dead, all right?

00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:28.194
Tai Yuk? Can you be sure?

00:36:28.195 --> 00:36:30.446
I'm telling you, he's dead.

00:36:30.447 --> 00:36:31.739
We cremated him today.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.575
What? That can't be true.
Where is he?

00:36:34.576 --> 00:36:36.744
I was just about to bury him.

00:36:36.745 --> 00:36:38.913
Give him this.

00:36:38.914 --> 00:36:41.165
Okay. You ready?

00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:47.672
I'll be right behind you.

00:36:47.673 --> 00:36:48.631
I've got you!

00:36:49.883 --> 00:36:51.217
Hey, you're not a girl.

00:36:51.218 --> 00:36:53.094
That's very rude.

00:36:53.095 --> 00:36:55.596
Want to dance with me?

00:36:55.597 --> 00:36:57.974
Go on! Run away!

00:36:57.975 --> 00:37:00.101
Sai Yuk, that's not going to stop him.

00:37:00.102 --> 00:37:02.061
- Oh, well.
- Come on...

00:37:05.899 --> 00:37:06.858
Get him!

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.655
He's on the roof!

00:37:15.576 --> 00:37:17.660
Look what I've caught.

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:22.290
Ma!

00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:24.792
Fong, save yourself. Just go.

00:37:24.793 --> 00:37:26.794
No way. You need my protection.

00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:27.753
I'll be right there.

00:37:28.964 --> 00:37:30.173
Close it up!

00:37:30.174 --> 00:37:32.175
He's ours!

00:37:32.176 --> 00:37:34.343
Now, that'll stop your running.

00:37:34.344 --> 00:37:35.803
Wouldn't you rather
be married than dead?

00:37:35.804 --> 00:37:37.346
Sir, I have good news.

00:37:37.514 --> 00:37:38.639
Your daughter has returned.

00:37:40.976 --> 00:37:42.351
See? Get ready!

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:44.103
You have to let him go.

00:37:44.104 --> 00:37:46.189
Otherwise, the whole village
will be against you.

00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:50.026
Nobody's going
to stop this wedding.

00:37:50.027 --> 00:37:51.819
- Let's go.
- Come on, let me out!

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.529
Help her. This isn't fair!

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.365
Go back to your homes.

00:37:56.533 --> 00:37:57.742
We won't go.

00:37:57.743 --> 00:37:59.160
- Let's free Fong ourselves.
- Let's do it!

00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:01.162
Get back.

00:38:01.163 --> 00:38:02.663
Go on.

00:38:02.664 --> 00:38:06.042
Otherwise, you will be arrested.

00:38:09.588 --> 00:38:11.672
Welcome, sir. Come in.

00:38:11.673 --> 00:38:14.133
Sir, the villagers are angry.

00:38:14.134 --> 00:38:16.052
They're demanding Fong's release.

00:38:16.053 --> 00:38:19.347
Maybe I should offer Fong
some money, as a bribe.

00:38:19.348 --> 00:38:22.225
I'd first try to convince the boy

00:38:22.226 --> 00:38:25.144
that getting married
is doing the right thing.

00:38:25.145 --> 00:38:27.021
Yes. Who knows?

00:38:27.022 --> 00:38:29.315
Maybe he'll agree with you.

00:38:29.316 --> 00:38:32.318
Yes. It's time he learns to obey me.

00:38:32.319 --> 00:38:34.362
No, that won't work.

00:38:34.363 --> 00:38:38.032
He'll only agree if he thinks
your motives are honorable.

00:38:38.033 --> 00:38:40.368
Ah, I see. I agree.

00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:43.538
A virtuous man needs love.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.379
I'll bet she has a face like her father.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.172
I'll die first.

00:38:53.173 --> 00:38:56.384
If he tries to kiss me, I'll kill him.

00:38:56.385 --> 00:38:59.428
She acts so calm.

00:39:02.641 --> 00:39:05.768
Maybe this will get her off my back.

00:39:07.771 --> 00:39:10.773
Oh, no, he's coming this way.

00:39:10.774 --> 00:39:14.026
If he takes one more step, I'll...

00:39:19.449 --> 00:39:20.825
Wow, that was really great...

00:39:20.826 --> 00:39:21.784
Whoa!

00:39:22.869 --> 00:39:24.620
Hey, why are you trying to kill me?

00:39:25.831 --> 00:39:26.998
I won't marry you.

00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:29.625
Don't worry.
You can keep your virtue.

00:39:29.626 --> 00:39:30.710
I love another.

00:39:30.711 --> 00:39:32.461
Good. Let's stop pretending.

00:39:32.629 --> 00:39:33.921
What about your father?

00:39:33.922 --> 00:39:36.924
Well, I'll talk to him
and I'll try to convince him.

00:39:36.925 --> 00:39:39.051
Good luck.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.096
Give that to me.

00:39:42.097 --> 00:39:43.556
Don't worry.

00:39:43.557 --> 00:39:45.224
I don't want your father's money.

00:39:45.225 --> 00:39:48.019
Go on, take it.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.270
It's getting late.

00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:51.147
I'll sleep outside.

00:40:08.707 --> 00:40:13.419
Miss Lu, I told you,
my heart belongs to someone else.

00:40:14.796 --> 00:40:17.673
Maybe you should find her.

00:40:17.674 --> 00:40:18.716
Hey, you're not Miss Lu.

00:40:21.094 --> 00:40:23.846
But I... also love another.

00:40:23.847 --> 00:40:25.931
Another man?

00:40:27.851 --> 00:40:29.977
Tai Yuk... your brother.

00:40:29.978 --> 00:40:31.520
My brother?

00:40:31.688 --> 00:40:33.105
Are you sure?

00:40:33.106 --> 00:40:35.399
He's all I dream about.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.818
I knew when our legs
were intertwined,

00:40:37.819 --> 00:40:41.113
so I wrote this poem for him.

00:40:41.114 --> 00:40:42.281
Please read it.

00:40:42.282 --> 00:40:43.491
A poem?

00:40:43.492 --> 00:40:45.117
But you're married.

00:40:51.208 --> 00:40:55.294
Without him, only sadness remains.

00:40:59.966 --> 00:41:03.469
Boy. What are we going
to do now, Mom?

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.554
She wants to marry you.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:10.142
You look thin.

00:41:10.143 --> 00:41:11.435
I'm okay.

00:41:11.436 --> 00:41:13.896
But I need to tell you something.

00:41:13.897 --> 00:41:15.690
You're not a virgin?

00:41:17.401 --> 00:41:19.026
That's not what I mean.

00:41:19.027 --> 00:41:23.948
Look, Sai Yuk,
it's time for us to escape.

00:41:23.949 --> 00:41:25.783
How are we going
to do that when Lu's men

00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:27.785
are watching us all the time?

00:41:27.786 --> 00:41:29.578
I'm never alone.

00:41:29.746 --> 00:41:31.455
They've always got their eyes on me

00:41:31.456 --> 00:41:34.917
or they're following me
like a pack of dogs.

00:41:34.918 --> 00:41:37.378
Don't worry. I have a plan.

00:41:37.379 --> 00:41:39.880
First, we'll set Lu's house on fire.

00:41:39.881 --> 00:41:41.882
Then we'll get you out of here.

00:41:43.301 --> 00:41:44.385
What?

00:41:44.386 --> 00:41:46.679
Mom, are you all right?

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.806
- Yeah.
- Here.

00:41:48.807 --> 00:41:50.224
I want to show you this.

00:41:50.225 --> 00:41:53.227
- What's wrong?
- Don't worry.

00:41:53.228 --> 00:41:54.937
It's a love poem from Madam Lu.

00:41:56.273 --> 00:42:00.151
Siu Wan, tonight I have
a very important guest coming.

00:42:00.152 --> 00:42:02.236
I want everything to go well.

00:42:02.237 --> 00:42:03.529
It's very important.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.947
If there are any problems, send for me.

00:42:04.948 --> 00:42:05.906
As you wish.

00:42:24.885 --> 00:42:28.596
Mom, I don't think
this is such a good plan.

00:42:28.597 --> 00:42:30.139
Run!

00:42:36.605 --> 00:42:37.813
Hurry, Mom!

00:42:39.941 --> 00:42:41.442
They're right there.

00:42:41.443 --> 00:42:43.652
Getting closer.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.112
I'll try to divert them.

00:42:45.113 --> 00:42:46.238
Okay.

00:42:56.958 --> 00:42:59.502
Stop now or they'll go for you.

00:42:59.503 --> 00:43:01.378
Now, what are you doing here?

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:02.755
Get away.

00:43:02.756 --> 00:43:04.965
Wait a minute.

00:43:04.966 --> 00:43:06.509
Tai Yuk?

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.635
Is it you?

00:43:07.636 --> 00:43:10.054
Yes. I must talk to you.

00:43:10.055 --> 00:43:13.474
But if the dogs keep barking,
I won't be able to stay.

00:43:13.475 --> 00:43:16.018
Ah, all right. I see.

00:43:16.019 --> 00:43:17.478
Now stop that. Get over here.

00:43:17.479 --> 00:43:18.896
Hurry up. Come on.

00:43:18.897 --> 00:43:21.148
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.

00:43:21.149 --> 00:43:23.984
- Tai Yuk...
- Stop, madam.

00:43:23.985 --> 00:43:28.405
We cannot be together right now.

00:43:28.406 --> 00:43:31.826
From the first moment,
I knew that...

00:43:33.328 --> 00:43:37.665
I'd never find another person
I could love like you.

00:43:37.666 --> 00:43:44.964
Alas, it was like a dream come true,
so I wrote this poem.

00:43:44.965 --> 00:43:47.007
Two rivers.

00:43:47.008 --> 00:43:52.221
Sometimes...
when they come together,

00:43:52.222 --> 00:43:59.687
a perfect harmony of strength
and beauty is born.

00:43:59.688 --> 00:44:04.608
But then, they must
leave each other behind

00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:06.360
to join the sea.

00:44:06.361 --> 00:44:09.196
Your words are sweet.

00:44:09.197 --> 00:44:10.739
Madam, are you all right?

00:44:10.907 --> 00:44:11.949
I have to go.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:13.200
Don't say anything.

00:44:13.201 --> 00:44:15.744
I'll be back when I can.

00:44:17.163 --> 00:44:18.914
Tai Yuk.

00:44:20.292 --> 00:44:22.585
Mistress, do you need help?

00:44:22.586 --> 00:44:24.086
I'm all right.

00:44:24.087 --> 00:44:25.546
Just leave me alone.

00:44:25.547 --> 00:44:27.006
Just go away.

00:44:27.007 --> 00:44:27.965
Don't say that.

00:44:48.153 --> 00:44:51.906
Hey, it's you, the girl from the race.

00:44:54.117 --> 00:44:55.576
You.

00:44:55.577 --> 00:44:58.662
So, are you a prisoner here, too?

00:44:58.663 --> 00:45:00.748
Just like you.

00:45:00.749 --> 00:45:04.376
- Well, great.
- Yeah.

00:45:04.377 --> 00:45:07.838
Why didn't you say good-bye to me?

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:12.176
Well, you and your friends
were so busy celebrating...

00:45:12.177 --> 00:45:13.510
I was too shy.

00:45:14.554 --> 00:45:17.473
Does this mean you like me?

00:45:22.228 --> 00:45:24.772
Here. Your medal.

00:45:24.773 --> 00:45:26.398
You forgot to take it.

00:45:26.399 --> 00:45:27.858
I gave it to you.

00:45:27.859 --> 00:45:29.944
Okay.

00:45:31.237 --> 00:45:32.863
Who goes there?

00:45:32.864 --> 00:45:34.740
You'd better go. Someone's coming.

00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:36.617
I'll see you later.

00:45:36.618 --> 00:45:39.578
Hey! I'll come back for you.

00:45:40.997 --> 00:45:43.916
My spies tell me
the Red Flower Society

00:45:43.917 --> 00:45:47.795
is meeting tonight, in secret.

00:45:47.796 --> 00:45:49.630
I need you both to help me.

00:45:49.631 --> 00:45:54.593
You must find the location of this meeting.

00:45:54.594 --> 00:45:57.638
- Can you do this for me?
- Of course.

00:45:57.639 --> 00:45:59.306
Yes, all right.

00:45:59.307 --> 00:46:01.183
Don't worry. We'll find them.

00:46:01.184 --> 00:46:04.728
It's a real honor
to serve our emperor.

00:46:04.729 --> 00:46:09.608
Now, you'd honor me
if you ate my Manchu chicken.

00:46:13.655 --> 00:46:15.864
Ma, what about Dad?

00:46:16.032 --> 00:46:17.157
We have to get out of here.

00:46:17.158 --> 00:46:18.575
Tiger Lu's looking for us.

00:46:22.163 --> 00:46:23.789
We've had it.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:25.791
Let me explain.

00:46:31.297 --> 00:46:33.882
Hold it.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.677
You're going to be married tomorrow.

00:46:36.678 --> 00:46:38.178
And what about you?

00:46:38.179 --> 00:46:41.390
Were you going to invite me
to our son's wedding?

00:46:41.391 --> 00:46:42.933
Have you forgotten I'm your husband?

00:46:42.934 --> 00:46:45.436
It's really my fault.

00:46:45.437 --> 00:46:46.520
Go on.

00:46:46.521 --> 00:46:47.855
Stop it.

00:46:47.856 --> 00:46:49.857
This is my problem.

00:46:49.858 --> 00:46:52.359
Well, I thought that
if I won the competition

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.863
that maybe I'd bring honor
back to this family.

00:46:55.864 --> 00:46:57.823
I'm going to run away!

00:46:57.824 --> 00:46:58.907
- I'm so ashamed.
- Mom, stop.

00:46:58.908 --> 00:47:00.701
- It's all my fault.
- Stop!

00:47:00.702 --> 00:47:01.952
- It's all my fault.
- It's not your fault.

00:47:01.953 --> 00:47:02.911
- Let me go.
- Come on. Please.

00:47:03.079 --> 00:47:04.121
All right, all right.

00:47:04.122 --> 00:47:05.664
- Just calm down.
- Let me go.

00:47:05.665 --> 00:47:08.459
When I return, I'll settle this matter.

00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:11.712
What? Wait.

00:47:11.713 --> 00:47:13.672
Do you mean you're
going out just when...

00:47:13.673 --> 00:47:14.673
Just when I need you?

00:47:26.311 --> 00:47:27.895
A present.

00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:42.951
Hey, it's a present for me.

00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:44.703
A razor.

00:47:44.704 --> 00:47:46.371
Hey, that's my razor, not yours.

00:47:48.958 --> 00:47:50.667
Hey, Ma, it's raining.

00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:51.960
Get your dad's umbrella.

00:47:52.128 --> 00:47:54.129
- We'll find him.
- All right.

00:47:59.219 --> 00:48:00.302
Come on, you'll get wet.

00:48:00.303 --> 00:48:01.762
Watch out for that puddle.

00:48:01.763 --> 00:48:04.640
Mom, how are we going to find him?

00:48:04.641 --> 00:48:06.141
I don't know.

00:48:06.142 --> 00:48:07.768
We'd better hurry.

00:48:07.769 --> 00:48:09.645
Here, give me that.

00:48:19.072 --> 00:48:23.909
I don't understand why your father
has to meet someone so late at night.

00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:27.663
Look.

00:48:27.664 --> 00:48:29.998
- It's not raining anymore.
- You stop.

00:48:30.166 --> 00:48:32.000
I hear Dad's voice over there.

00:48:32.168 --> 00:48:33.919
I'll try to help you.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.964
Just give me a little time
to work things out.

00:48:36.965 --> 00:48:39.758
Please, stop crying.

00:48:39.759 --> 00:48:41.760
You can trust me.

00:48:41.761 --> 00:48:44.763
Sure. That's what you think.

00:48:44.764 --> 00:48:46.181
Wait a minute. Mom.

00:48:46.182 --> 00:48:48.308
I wish I were dead.

00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:51.603
I won't let you kill yourself.

00:48:51.604 --> 00:48:53.605
Your child isn't born.

00:48:53.606 --> 00:48:55.858
He got her pregnant.

00:48:55.859 --> 00:48:59.319
Lok Ping, this child
is all you have left

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.405
of your dead husband.

00:49:01.406 --> 00:49:02.489
A great man.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.784
Your father isn't the father.

00:49:05.785 --> 00:49:08.787
I'm not surprised, but who are they?

00:49:08.788 --> 00:49:11.665
Your husband died
to protect our names.

00:49:11.666 --> 00:49:14.418
Now I must protect the list.

00:49:14.419 --> 00:49:17.004
The Red Flower brotherhood is safe.

00:49:17.005 --> 00:49:20.883
Say, maybe they'll let me join.

00:49:20.884 --> 00:49:23.051
They're probably all going to die.

00:49:23.052 --> 00:49:24.803
It'll be okay, Ma. Don't worry.

00:49:24.804 --> 00:49:26.180
There. Who are you?

00:49:29.517 --> 00:49:30.809
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:32.269
Hurry!

00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:39.234
Bandits?

00:49:39.235 --> 00:49:40.360
Manchu.

00:49:40.361 --> 00:49:41.528
- The emperor?
- Yeah.

00:49:41.529 --> 00:49:42.905
They're here to kill your father.

00:49:46.576 --> 00:49:48.869
I knew I'd find you.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.080
Your brotherhood seeks
to destroy the emperor.

00:49:53.374 --> 00:49:55.542
Every one of you is going to die.

00:49:55.543 --> 00:49:57.711
We'll never give up.

00:49:57.712 --> 00:50:01.089
I am protecting the people against an evil.

00:50:01.257 --> 00:50:03.717
Our country will be destroyed
by Emperor Qianlong.

00:50:03.718 --> 00:50:06.637
You're fighting me now.

00:50:06.638 --> 00:50:08.680
And money's my goal.

00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:12.059
This fight's about freedom,
not about your money.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.438
You are going to have to kill me
to get the list of our names.

00:50:16.439 --> 00:50:20.484
Do you see how great
your father is, Sai Yuk?

00:50:20.485 --> 00:50:22.694
What happened to my son?

00:50:35.583 --> 00:50:36.667
Let's hurry.

00:50:42.048 --> 00:50:43.548
Dad!

00:50:52.475 --> 00:50:54.226
You're dealing with me now,

00:50:54.227 --> 00:50:55.560
so get ready.

00:51:02.485 --> 00:51:03.735
Let's go.

00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:15.289
Not him, you bully.

00:51:36.019 --> 00:51:37.644
Have you got the list?

00:51:37.645 --> 00:51:39.187
Right here.

00:52:02.837 --> 00:52:04.379
You're beating the air now.

00:52:11.512 --> 00:52:13.096
Sai Yuk, over there.

00:52:13.097 --> 00:52:14.514
Lok Ping. She's hurt pretty bad.

00:52:14.515 --> 00:52:16.516
Okay.

00:52:16.517 --> 00:52:17.809
Look out!

00:52:25.401 --> 00:52:26.693
Watch out!

00:52:30.406 --> 00:52:33.200
Lady, are you in pain?

00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:34.534
It's okay.

00:52:34.535 --> 00:52:36.328
My baby is going to be all right.

00:52:36.329 --> 00:52:37.746
Father will be very pleased.

00:52:37.747 --> 00:52:40.707
- Support him, all right?
- Yes, I will.

00:52:43.211 --> 00:52:45.420
Come on, Sai Yuk. Let's go.

00:52:46.631 --> 00:52:47.714
I'll follow you.

00:52:47.715 --> 00:52:49.007
Okay. Hurry up.

00:53:34.595 --> 00:53:35.554
That hurts.

00:53:52.947 --> 00:53:54.906
I won't give up.

00:53:54.907 --> 00:53:56.491
More?

00:54:01.664 --> 00:54:04.124
Whew. You had about enough?

00:54:04.125 --> 00:54:05.459
Never!

00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:22.058
Now you'll never beat me.

00:55:18.741 --> 00:55:22.702
I see your stick is too short to win.

00:55:22.703 --> 00:55:25.121
If yours were harder,
it wouldn't bend like that.

00:57:05.097 --> 00:57:07.515
Sai Yuk, were you followed?

00:57:07.683 --> 00:57:10.143
Forget it, Dad. I watched my back.

00:57:11.312 --> 00:57:13.813
What about Mom?

00:57:13.814 --> 00:57:16.650
Your face is red.

00:57:19.403 --> 00:57:22.280
Oh, Ma, what's the matter?

00:57:23.366 --> 00:57:24.532
It's your father.

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.577
His poetry is so beautiful.

00:57:27.578 --> 00:57:31.122
I... I don't know why
it seems to make me so happy.

00:57:31.123 --> 00:57:35.168
Aw, that's so wonderful.

00:57:35.169 --> 00:57:38.254
It's no joke. I'm serious.

00:57:38.255 --> 00:57:40.173
- Wow.
- It makes me happy.

00:57:40.174 --> 00:57:41.758
What a mystery.

00:57:41.759 --> 00:57:43.510
Sai Yuk!

00:57:43.511 --> 00:57:47.305
Son, you can leave now.

00:57:49.725 --> 00:57:52.394
Father, I don't want to leave you.

00:57:52.395 --> 00:57:55.146
I'm a man now.

00:57:55.147 --> 00:58:00.318
My days as a child are gone, forever.

00:58:00.319 --> 00:58:05.031
It's time for me
to be more responsible.

00:58:05.032 --> 00:58:09.077
Hey, this means I can try
some of my new moves.

00:58:09.078 --> 00:58:10.578
For my country.

00:58:10.579 --> 00:58:13.248
Well, you're going to need my help, too.

00:58:13.249 --> 00:58:15.291
I won't leave, either.

00:58:20.423 --> 00:58:24.092
Now we all must hide
at Tiger Lu's house.

00:58:24.093 --> 00:58:26.177
Dad, you must be kidding.

00:58:26.178 --> 00:58:28.930
They won't look for us there.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.226
You what?

00:58:33.227 --> 00:58:35.353
They both just ran away from my house.

00:58:35.354 --> 00:58:36.688
Right.

00:58:36.689 --> 00:58:38.398
But that was before.

00:58:38.399 --> 00:58:40.817
Now they realize they were wrong.

00:58:40.818 --> 00:58:44.404
Even my naughty son
sees you're a virtuous man.

00:58:44.405 --> 00:58:45.780
They're both sorry.

00:58:45.781 --> 00:58:49.075
So what we would like
is to live here with you

00:58:49.076 --> 00:58:51.453
and maybe become better people.

00:58:53.497 --> 00:58:56.291
Of course you can stay with me,

00:58:56.292 --> 00:59:00.295
but you must do as I say
because I am so virtuous.

00:59:04.967 --> 00:59:07.510
Here comes my daughter, Ting Ting.

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:10.221
She's going to make your son a good wife.

00:59:10.222 --> 00:59:11.890
Go on. Go.

00:59:18.397 --> 00:59:20.648
Honey, I've missed you so.

00:59:20.816 --> 00:59:23.151
It's not me, it's her.

00:59:28.908 --> 00:59:30.033
- You?
- You?

00:59:37.625 --> 00:59:39.626
You're real.

00:59:39.627 --> 00:59:41.252
You're right.

00:59:55.684 --> 00:59:58.686
Our son's romantic.

00:59:58.687 --> 01:00:01.022
He learned that from me.

01:00:01.023 --> 01:00:03.233
Come on, stand up.

01:00:03.234 --> 01:00:04.651
- Come on.
- Wait, wait.

01:00:04.652 --> 01:00:06.444
We can't...

01:00:06.445 --> 01:00:09.989
Ting Ting, I want you to have
this old family treasure

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.158
because now you're a part of our family.

01:00:12.159 --> 01:00:14.035
Oh, thank you.

01:00:14.036 --> 01:00:15.537
Very good.

01:00:15.538 --> 01:00:17.705
Everything's arranged.

01:00:17.706 --> 01:00:19.415
Tomorrow's the big wedding.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:22.502
Even the governor's going to come.

01:00:22.503 --> 01:00:24.337
Oh, so sorry!

01:00:24.338 --> 01:00:25.547
Please, you must excuse me.

01:00:25.548 --> 01:00:27.006
Don't worry.

01:00:27.007 --> 01:00:30.218
It's nothing. See? I'm virtuous.

01:00:30.219 --> 01:00:33.763
Nothing bothers me anymore.

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:34.889
Now listen to me.

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:37.141
We must invite everyone that's important,

01:00:37.142 --> 01:00:39.602
and of course your family,
and have a big wedding.

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:42.480
And everyone will come,
and they'll see how virtuous I am.

01:00:59.081 --> 01:01:01.624
Hey, what about the party?

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.626
We need some people
to help us celebrate.

01:01:05.838 --> 01:01:08.631
But, uh, I'm sure they'll be here.

01:01:08.632 --> 01:01:09.757
You'll see.

01:01:09.758 --> 01:01:11.551
It takes a long time.

01:01:11.552 --> 01:01:13.428
They live far away.

01:01:13.429 --> 01:01:16.097
Sometimes it takes a week
to make the journey.

01:01:16.098 --> 01:01:18.683
Hey, your son knows lots of people.

01:01:18.684 --> 01:01:19.642
What about them?

01:01:21.937 --> 01:01:23.980
He's right. It's true.

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:26.941
They would come,
but they're all in prison.

01:01:28.861 --> 01:01:30.069
In prison?

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.780
They'd be here if they could.

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:37.118
Master.

01:01:37.119 --> 01:01:38.870
It's the governor. He's here.

01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:41.205
At last, someone's finally come.

01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:44.709
Be still.

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:46.252
I'll do the talking.

01:01:46.253 --> 01:01:47.420
He will?

01:01:47.421 --> 01:01:49.130
Welcome, Governor.

01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:50.465
Congratulations.

01:01:50.466 --> 01:01:52.133
I brought a guest.

01:01:52.134 --> 01:01:54.469
You honor me, sir.

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:56.220
- Whoa.
- Well, time to go.

01:01:56.221 --> 01:01:58.181
Hey, we can all greet the governor.

01:01:58.182 --> 01:01:59.432
- Come on.
- Of course.

01:01:59.433 --> 01:02:01.142
- That's right.
- What now?

01:02:01.143 --> 01:02:02.310
- Come on with me.
- I don't know.

01:02:02.311 --> 01:02:04.395
Please, come in.

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:11.110
These are my in-laws and my wife.

01:02:11.111 --> 01:02:13.279
- I bow to your honorableness.
- Yes, welcome.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.614
- Please, sit down.
- Yes, have a seat.

01:02:14.615 --> 01:02:15.740
It's an honor to have you here.

01:02:15.741 --> 01:02:18.201
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

01:02:18.202 --> 01:02:19.327
Thank you for coming.

01:02:22.289 --> 01:02:24.248
Please sit.

01:02:26.794 --> 01:02:28.461
Hey, what's wrong?

01:02:28.462 --> 01:02:30.004
Come on and join us.
What's the matter?

01:02:30.005 --> 01:02:32.715
Oh, no. Your table
is much too crowded.

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:34.258
We'd better stay here.

01:02:34.259 --> 01:02:35.593
What is the matter?

01:02:35.594 --> 01:02:37.637
It's not crowded. Come on.

01:02:37.638 --> 01:02:39.472
Hey, I dropped something.

01:02:39.473 --> 01:02:41.015
Good. I'll help him look.

01:02:41.016 --> 01:02:43.059
What is this?

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.811
Now you, sir, come join me.

01:02:44.812 --> 01:02:46.854
Well, Mr. Lu...

01:02:48.524 --> 01:02:49.649
Oh, no, I can't find the money.

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:50.858
Don't worry, son, I'll help you.

01:02:51.026 --> 01:02:52.568
Yep, I think I found it.

01:02:56.573 --> 01:02:57.532
What?

01:03:00.494 --> 01:03:01.828
Please forgive them.

01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:03.663
What's the problem?

01:03:03.664 --> 01:03:05.707
Come on. Serve us now.

01:03:07.626 --> 01:03:09.419
Son, it's your favorite.

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.170
I'll serve you.

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.884
Here.

01:03:17.052 --> 01:03:19.512
Oh, Mother.

01:03:19.513 --> 01:03:21.097
Please, move it to the left.

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:22.181
No, to the right.

01:03:22.182 --> 01:03:24.225
No. No, no. To the left.
No, no, no. No, no.

01:03:24.226 --> 01:03:26.102
Back to the right.

01:03:29.523 --> 01:03:31.190
He's a traitor.

01:03:31.191 --> 01:03:32.900
You're lying.

01:03:33.068 --> 01:03:34.902
His babbling dishonors my boy.

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:36.571
Hey, that's my son-in-law.

01:03:36.572 --> 01:03:38.573
So he's your guest.

01:03:38.574 --> 01:03:39.907
Right.

01:03:39.908 --> 01:03:41.325
This must be a mistake.

01:03:41.326 --> 01:03:42.493
Traitor.

01:03:42.494 --> 01:03:43.786
No!

01:03:45.414 --> 01:03:46.664
Siu Wan!

01:03:46.665 --> 01:03:47.915
Ma!

01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:49.208
Run.

01:03:49.209 --> 01:03:50.585
- Now.
- Better not.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.724
Let me help.

01:04:04.725 --> 01:04:06.059
He's a madman!

01:04:07.186 --> 01:04:09.103
- Move it!
- Get cover!

01:04:09.104 --> 01:04:10.897
Get them! Get them!

01:04:10.898 --> 01:04:13.399
- Reload!
- Come on, move it.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.942
I am. Push!

01:04:16.737 --> 01:04:18.404
Master, what now?

01:04:18.405 --> 01:04:19.947
Don't worry. Hurry!

01:04:20.115 --> 01:04:21.449
Fire!

01:04:25.245 --> 01:04:26.329
Ready!

01:04:30.709 --> 01:04:32.585
- Go.
- Move in!

01:04:32.586 --> 01:04:34.128
Hands up!

01:04:34.129 --> 01:04:36.923
Hurry up, you fools,
before they escape.

01:04:40.803 --> 01:04:44.597
Now, you're my hostage.

01:04:44.598 --> 01:04:46.557
They'll be back to get you.

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:52.438
I need to come up with a plan.

01:04:52.439 --> 01:04:54.774
It's all your fault, damn you.

01:04:54.775 --> 01:04:56.192
My life is ruined now!

01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.069
And the emperor thinks I'm a traitor.

01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:59.779
And I have no place to live.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.988
I hate you.

01:05:00.989 --> 01:05:02.156
Please, master.

01:05:02.157 --> 01:05:03.783
It's not Sai Yuk's fault.

01:05:03.784 --> 01:05:04.992
What?

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.619
You want to lose your head?

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.455
Free him and stop your bullying.

01:05:09.456 --> 01:05:11.916
I'll bully anyone I want to.

01:05:11.917 --> 01:05:13.251
Okay, let's fight.

01:05:13.252 --> 01:05:14.502
Don't, please.

01:05:14.503 --> 01:05:17.004
Help me! Mother has a fever!

01:05:18.757 --> 01:05:20.007
Get out of my way.

01:05:20.175 --> 01:05:21.843
Siu Wan, I'm coming!

01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:24.428
Most kind.

01:05:24.429 --> 01:05:25.721
Thank you, lady.

01:05:28.267 --> 01:05:30.434
Siu Wan.

01:05:30.435 --> 01:05:32.436
Master, she needs a doctor.

01:05:32.437 --> 01:05:34.105
- Let me help.
- Get away from us.

01:05:34.106 --> 01:05:35.898
Don't touch her.

01:05:37.568 --> 01:05:39.569
- Get away.
- I can carry her.

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.280
Take your hands off her.

01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:44.991
- Mother?
- Come on, Ting Ting, let's go.

01:05:44.992 --> 01:05:46.617
She's too weak to walk.

01:05:46.618 --> 01:05:48.494
You go save yourselves.

01:05:48.495 --> 01:05:49.704
We're going on our own.

01:05:49.705 --> 01:05:51.831
Please. I trust her.

01:05:51.832 --> 01:05:53.624
I believe what she's saying.

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:56.085
Come now or you are
no longer my daughter.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.799
Sai Yuk, good-bye.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.718
Let's go. Now.

01:06:03.719 --> 01:06:06.637
I'm so sorry.

01:06:07.848 --> 01:06:09.974
It'll be all right.

01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:11.893
I'd better do something.

01:06:11.894 --> 01:06:13.853
I'll go back to town.

01:06:13.854 --> 01:06:15.146
What about Dad?

01:06:15.147 --> 01:06:16.480
You must find him.

01:06:31.997 --> 01:06:33.372
Who's there?

01:06:33.373 --> 01:06:35.082
It's Sai Yuk.

01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:37.710
Come on, Sing. Hurry up.

01:06:37.711 --> 01:06:39.086
I think I hear someone.

01:06:39.254 --> 01:06:40.504
Come on, hurry.

01:06:45.886 --> 01:06:49.680
Sing, I saw the notice that they're going
to execute my father tomorrow.

01:06:49.681 --> 01:06:51.015
Can you help me?

01:06:51.016 --> 01:06:53.351
I can't.

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:57.855
I'm scared.

01:06:57.856 --> 01:06:59.106
And poor Bo.

01:06:59.107 --> 01:07:00.399
What? Tell me.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.487
Sai Yuk, everything, it's all my fault.

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:08.115
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

01:07:08.116 --> 01:07:10.243
Come on, you can tell me.

01:07:11.745 --> 01:07:14.747
Some officers took
Bo and me for questioning.

01:07:14.748 --> 01:07:16.123
I told them that I didn't know you,

01:07:16.291 --> 01:07:17.750
but Bo laughed in their faces

01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:19.877
and said he was proud
to be your friend.

01:07:19.878 --> 01:07:21.254
I'm a coward.

01:07:22.464 --> 01:07:24.131
But where is he?

01:07:24.299 --> 01:07:26.425
He's down by the western gate.

01:07:26.426 --> 01:07:27.927
But he's...

01:07:27.928 --> 01:07:31.097
The officers were tired

01:07:31.098 --> 01:07:35.309
and they wanted Bo to kowtow
before they'd release him,

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:37.144
but... but he refused.

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:40.523
Then what happened?
Then what?

01:07:53.245 --> 01:07:55.454
- Hey, you shouldn't be here.
- You'd better go.

01:07:55.455 --> 01:07:57.623
I've come for my friend.

01:07:57.624 --> 01:07:59.166
You'd better leave now.

01:07:59.334 --> 01:08:01.836
Hey, you look familiar.

01:08:01.837 --> 01:08:03.129
What's your name?

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:04.672
Fong Sai Yuk.

01:08:04.673 --> 01:08:06.424
Hey, it's him!

01:08:06.425 --> 01:08:08.467
And I'm not leaving
without my friend.

01:08:08.468 --> 01:08:13.347
So you'd better be going,
or else I'll...

01:08:13.348 --> 01:08:15.141
I'll have to fight you.

01:08:15.142 --> 01:08:17.476
- Then we'll fight.
- Yeah, all of us.

01:08:17.477 --> 01:08:19.145
Bo will win this battle.

01:08:19.146 --> 01:08:20.855
Attack him!

01:08:50.844 --> 01:08:54.472
Now... we'll beat them together.

01:08:56.141 --> 01:08:57.558
Let's go!

01:09:37.182 --> 01:09:38.766
Now beg him.

01:09:38.767 --> 01:09:39.809
Get down.

01:09:41.895 --> 01:09:44.438
And beg his forgiveness.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:47.066
So sorry!

01:09:47.067 --> 01:09:49.485
- Sorry.
- Forgive me.

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:51.946
- I'm so sorry.
- Forgive us.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.207
All right. We've won, Bo.

01:10:35.991 --> 01:10:38.284
Good-bye, dear friend.

01:10:38.285 --> 01:10:39.994
I'll never forget you.

01:10:39.995 --> 01:10:43.789
I'm certain we'll meet again
in another life.

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:46.333
Safe journey.

01:10:46.501 --> 01:10:49.670
Sir, do you need help?

01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:51.797
Macu.

01:10:51.798 --> 01:10:53.966
They're going to execute
my father tomorrow.

01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:57.803
Master, we can't allow it.

01:10:57.804 --> 01:11:01.182
I have to rescue him, at once.

01:11:01.183 --> 01:11:02.266
You must help me.

01:11:02.267 --> 01:11:05.769
Master, please, I'll do anything,
but they're going to kill you.

01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:07.813
- Please don't do it.
- It's Mother.

01:11:07.814 --> 01:11:09.815
Protect her.

01:11:09.816 --> 01:11:12.902
Please, you can't
tell her about my plan.

01:11:14.154 --> 01:11:16.739
Macu, come on.

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.782
It's going to be all right.

01:11:18.783 --> 01:11:21.744
My mother needs you,
and I'll be okay.

01:11:21.745 --> 01:11:22.703
So let's go.

01:11:25.624 --> 01:11:27.625
All right.

01:11:27.626 --> 01:11:28.959
Tell me, what about your father?

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.169
I almost forgot.

01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:31.879
I saw him.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.173
He told me to tell you, don't you worry.

01:11:34.174 --> 01:11:35.299
Everything is great.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.383
He said that?

01:11:36.551 --> 01:11:38.594
You better believe it.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:40.846
But your father wouldn't say that.

01:11:40.847 --> 01:11:44.767
He thought that he would
really make you happy with this.

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:48.854
You're to meet him with Macu
at Puishi Beach for a holiday.

01:11:48.855 --> 01:11:51.398
Oh, boy.

01:11:51.566 --> 01:11:52.608
Right, Macu?

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:55.361
Come on, I told you
all about his plan.

01:11:55.362 --> 01:11:58.155
Go on, tell her. Come on.

01:11:58.156 --> 01:12:01.700
What he said is true, Mistress.

01:12:01.701 --> 01:12:03.577
But he hates the water.

01:12:03.578 --> 01:12:09.667
Yeah, well, he told me to tell you
that now he wants to be different.

01:12:09.668 --> 01:12:12.878
Okay? isn't what
I'm saying true, Macu?

01:12:12.879 --> 01:12:14.922
Come on, tell her the rest of the story.

01:12:14.923 --> 01:12:16.006
I got it.

01:12:16.007 --> 01:12:18.801
He said it came to him in a dream.

01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:22.721
A big fish told him
to learn to swim at Puishi Beach.

01:12:22.722 --> 01:12:23.806
And then it ate him.

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:25.724
You would know.

01:12:25.725 --> 01:12:29.186
Well, that's quite a story.

01:12:29.187 --> 01:12:31.021
They can all go to hell.

01:12:31.022 --> 01:12:34.858
Damn those Cantonese bastards.

01:12:36.903 --> 01:12:41.407
We need a doctor, and instead,
they send an officer to arrest us.

01:12:41.408 --> 01:12:43.617
Can't be trusted, those bastards!

01:12:43.618 --> 01:12:46.870
They're all just a bunch of liars!

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.418
Come on, Macu.

01:12:55.964 --> 01:12:58.424
Ting Ting, come inside our boat.

01:12:58.425 --> 01:13:00.009
Beat it!

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:02.886
Otherwise, I'll have
those Cantonese bastards

01:13:02.887 --> 01:13:04.471
come and arrest all three of you.

01:13:04.472 --> 01:13:06.056
Stop.

01:13:06.057 --> 01:13:08.058
You better be quiet.

01:13:08.059 --> 01:13:11.812
Please, let me help her,
or she might die.

01:13:11.813 --> 01:13:15.149
Ting Ting, you go.

01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:16.317
I won't leave you, Mother.

01:13:16.318 --> 01:13:19.111
Yes, you must go.

01:13:19.112 --> 01:13:20.946
Please let her go.

01:13:20.947 --> 01:13:22.740
It's just your pride.

01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:24.241
She's just trying to protect you.

01:13:25.452 --> 01:13:28.078
Stop your yelping. I know better.

01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:31.290
Just stop talking and help me
get her on this boat

01:13:31.291 --> 01:13:33.125
and out of this damn rain, okay?

01:13:33.126 --> 01:13:35.085
Macu, carry her.

01:13:55.315 --> 01:13:57.191
Siu Wan.

01:13:57.192 --> 01:13:59.860
Why is this happening to me?

01:13:59.861 --> 01:14:02.196
Why are the gods so angry?

01:14:05.492 --> 01:14:07.326
They've given you an answer.

01:14:07.327 --> 01:14:08.702
Come with me, now.

01:14:08.703 --> 01:14:10.537
You'd better get going.

01:14:10.705 --> 01:14:12.039
I'm here, Mother.

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:18.379
Sai Yuk, Ting Ting outside.

01:14:21.383 --> 01:14:24.885
We need to talk.

01:14:24.886 --> 01:14:28.389
Go. Go on.

01:14:34.854 --> 01:14:39.566
Kind lady, will you please help me?

01:14:41.069 --> 01:14:42.778
Quiet.

01:14:47.867 --> 01:14:49.785
I miss Tai Yuk.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.748
But, dear lady,

01:14:54.749 --> 01:14:57.292
Tai Yuk has returned to you.

01:15:06.052 --> 01:15:11.265
Please, recite a poem.

01:15:13.184 --> 01:15:18.605
Some time in autumn,

01:15:18.773 --> 01:15:21.692
a tiny leaf falls to the ground

01:15:21.693 --> 01:15:24.903
and brings a big snow

01:15:24.904 --> 01:15:27.448
for eternity.

01:15:27.449 --> 01:15:32.369
But you're here, Tai Yuk.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:35.456
Yes.

01:15:44.174 --> 01:15:46.842
I'll always...

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:49.678
be right...

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:52.264
beside you.

01:15:52.265 --> 01:15:58.395
In our next life, we'll be man and wife.

01:16:00.273 --> 01:16:01.774
All right.

01:16:13.828 --> 01:16:15.913
Siu Wan.

01:16:18.416 --> 01:16:19.833
Mother!

01:16:19.834 --> 01:16:22.920
Siu Wan!

01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:28.467
Please, sir.

01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:32.221
Take my umbrella.

01:16:32.222 --> 01:16:39.728
After today, we won't fight anymore
because you are my family.

01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:42.981
Macu will take care of you.

01:16:42.982 --> 01:16:44.608
You must go.

01:16:44.609 --> 01:16:48.612
Life will be better
when we leave this place.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.215
All right.

01:17:15.682 --> 01:17:18.517
Siu Wan!

01:17:42.917 --> 01:17:45.377
I won't sleep until I see you.

01:17:45.378 --> 01:17:48.714
So you hurry it up or I'll be mad.

01:17:48.715 --> 01:17:51.383
Master, please take care.

01:17:51.384 --> 01:17:52.759
Stop crying.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.344
God, you're so dramatic.

01:17:54.345 --> 01:17:57.306
What do you think,
he's going to die or something?

01:17:57.307 --> 01:17:59.975
It's just that I'm going to miss him.

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:01.768
No more crying.

01:18:01.936 --> 01:18:04.771
I'll be there in a day, okay?

01:18:04.772 --> 01:18:07.149
Sai Yuk...

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:08.233
take care.

01:18:08.234 --> 01:18:09.359
I will.

01:18:10.862 --> 01:18:12.321
Will you promise something?

01:18:12.322 --> 01:18:14.239
If I can.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:17.784
If I die, you will always remember me?

01:18:17.785 --> 01:18:20.787
I promise.

01:18:20.788 --> 01:18:23.498
- I won't forget you.
- What's wrong?

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:25.584
I just can't help it.

01:18:25.585 --> 01:18:26.752
I worry.

01:18:26.753 --> 01:18:28.629
About women?

01:18:30.798 --> 01:18:34.092
Please, don't act like this.

01:18:34.093 --> 01:18:36.053
You don't need to worry about us.

01:18:42.727 --> 01:18:45.395
He talks like his father.

01:18:45.396 --> 01:18:48.690
Hey, Mr. Lu, who taught her
how to kiss like that?

01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:51.985
Forget it.

01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:56.698
It's yours.

01:18:56.699 --> 01:18:58.075
But why?

01:18:59.786 --> 01:19:02.287
- For luck.
- Then I'll wear it.

01:19:02.288 --> 01:19:04.581
Come on, Ting Ting. We've got to go.

01:19:04.582 --> 01:19:06.583
Good-bye.

01:19:14.425 --> 01:19:18.178
Sai Yuk, remember, I'll be waiting.

01:19:18.179 --> 01:19:20.597
Okay, Mom.

01:19:20.598 --> 01:19:23.141
And be sure you don't forget to eat.

01:19:23.142 --> 01:19:26.853
And remember to stay out of the rain
so you don't catch cold.

01:19:27.021 --> 01:19:29.606
And don't trust any strangers.

01:19:29.607 --> 01:19:32.901
We'll all be waiting
for you at Puishi Beach.

01:19:32.902 --> 01:19:35.904
Good-bye, Sai Yuk.

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:38.156
Young Master, promise you'll hurry.

01:19:38.157 --> 01:19:39.825
I'll be there.

01:20:20.199 --> 01:20:24.995
Now, I'm going to
ask you one more time.

01:20:24.996 --> 01:20:28.290
Give me the list of names,
and you won't die.

01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:30.709
You'll have to kill me, then.

01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:32.919
I won't betray my friends
or my country.

01:20:33.087 --> 01:20:37.758
This man is a liar and a traitor.

01:20:37.759 --> 01:20:42.304
He must die in order
to protect our emperor.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:46.433
Now, our economy
is the finest in the world.

01:20:46.434 --> 01:20:49.061
And our people are happy.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.646
He's lying.

01:20:51.647 --> 01:20:53.231
Be quiet.

01:20:53.232 --> 01:20:55.525
Unless you want to die as well.

01:20:56.819 --> 01:20:59.654
- It's time.
- Let's go.

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:10.248
This is wrong.

01:21:10.249 --> 01:21:12.959
I know him. He's a good man.

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:20.258
Chop.

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:17.149
Stop him!

01:22:20.319 --> 01:22:21.528
Sai Yuk!

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:37.502
Get back.

01:22:37.503 --> 01:22:40.547
I've got dynamite, okay?

01:22:40.548 --> 01:22:41.631
Hold it.

01:22:41.632 --> 01:22:45.051
Give up. You won't escape.

01:22:45.219 --> 01:22:48.346
And you won't be able to free him.

01:22:48.347 --> 01:22:50.432
Maybe so, but I have to try.

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:55.103
But if you give that to me,
I'll be sure you're both released.

01:22:55.104 --> 01:22:57.063
Don't, Sai Yuk.

01:22:57.064 --> 01:22:58.607
He's lying.

01:22:58.608 --> 01:23:00.483
His promises are empty!

01:23:03.696 --> 01:23:05.989
That's very smart of you.

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:11.244
Maybe you and I will
one day become good friends.

01:23:11.245 --> 01:23:12.704
Very rich.

01:23:12.705 --> 01:23:14.456
Just forget it.

01:23:14.457 --> 01:23:16.249
You don't fool us.

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:19.252
My father and these people
will never give up.

01:23:19.253 --> 01:23:21.087
This isn't about money.

01:23:21.255 --> 01:23:23.840
It's about freedom for China.

01:23:27.678 --> 01:23:33.058
You're brave, and your words
are powerful, so I'll be generous.

01:23:33.059 --> 01:23:35.560
We'll see if your courage is real.

01:23:35.561 --> 01:23:38.396
Now, pay careful attention.

01:23:39.941 --> 01:23:42.359
You're going to have to win this time.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:47.113
You'll have to defeat me
before this fire burns through the rope.

01:23:47.281 --> 01:23:50.283
If I win, you must
give me your names.

01:24:41.127 --> 01:24:42.085
Come on!

01:24:55.599 --> 01:24:57.809
Can't you do better?

01:24:57.810 --> 01:24:59.102
I hope you're trying.

01:25:00.771 --> 01:25:04.399
Very good, but not good enough.

01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:21.374
You better get ready.

01:27:41.974 --> 01:27:43.266
Take it!

01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:09.292
Sai Yuk.

01:28:09.293 --> 01:28:11.211
Let it go now.

01:28:11.212 --> 01:28:12.587
No way!

01:28:12.588 --> 01:28:13.838
I'm going to save you.

01:28:13.839 --> 01:28:15.131
Let go.

01:28:15.132 --> 01:28:18.259
I'm proud that you're so grown up.

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.385
Now go on.

01:28:19.553 --> 01:28:22.180
Your mother and Ting Ting need you.

01:28:22.181 --> 01:28:26.643
I'm proud today to die
for my people and China.

01:28:28.062 --> 01:28:29.646
No!

01:28:29.647 --> 01:28:32.148
I'm not going to let you die.

01:28:37.696 --> 01:28:40.073
Sai Yuk, it's too late.

01:28:40.074 --> 01:28:41.824
Then we'll both die.

01:28:46.413 --> 01:28:49.207
Fong Sai Yuk, we'll help you!

01:28:49.208 --> 01:28:50.166
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:28:56.048 --> 01:28:57.507
Get back!

01:28:57.508 --> 01:28:59.717
Don't move!

01:28:59.718 --> 01:29:02.178
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:29:02.179 --> 01:29:03.263
Get the rope!

01:29:03.264 --> 01:29:05.181
Everyone, everyone! Grab it!

01:29:18.946 --> 01:29:20.947
Here are your names.

01:29:20.948 --> 01:29:23.866
Fools, stop them!

01:29:29.081 --> 01:29:31.291
Don't worry. I'm here.

01:29:34.545 --> 01:29:36.045
Come on! Come on!

01:29:48.934 --> 01:29:50.935
Sai Yuk, you're a bad liar.

01:29:50.936 --> 01:29:52.770
You should know I'd want to help.

01:29:53.981 --> 01:29:55.440
Macu, why'd you tell my mother?

01:29:55.441 --> 01:29:56.524
But I didn't, Master.

01:29:56.525 --> 01:29:57.650
She figured it out herself.

01:29:57.651 --> 01:29:59.444
Are you sure?

01:29:59.445 --> 01:30:01.904
She said it was your eyes
that betrayed you.

01:30:01.905 --> 01:30:03.406
- Go help her.
- Okay.

01:30:03.407 --> 01:30:04.741
Right!

01:30:08.078 --> 01:30:10.913
You make me very angry.

01:30:15.794 --> 01:30:16.753
What's happening?

01:30:44.073 --> 01:30:45.698
Husband, are you okay?

01:30:45.699 --> 01:30:46.783
Yeah. Come on.

01:30:49.286 --> 01:30:51.412
Mom, they're trying to kill Dad.

01:30:57.002 --> 01:30:58.419
Stay close.

01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:15.561
Even you won't be able
to help him...

01:31:15.729 --> 01:31:16.813
now.

01:31:18.524 --> 01:31:22.777
We're both going to die together.

01:31:28.742 --> 01:31:30.493
My shoe can help.

01:31:42.548 --> 01:31:44.924
Mom.

01:31:57.646 --> 01:32:00.398
Sai Yuk, you're a brave fighter.

01:32:00.399 --> 01:32:02.859
Let me teach you to be
a kung fu master.

01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.694
- Come with me.
- Father?

01:32:04.695 --> 01:32:07.196
You bring great honor
to our family, Master Chan.

01:32:08.699 --> 01:32:11.242
So, now we'll say good-bye to you.

01:32:11.243 --> 01:32:12.618
Please, sir.

01:32:12.619 --> 01:32:13.619
Can my wife come with us?

01:32:13.787 --> 01:32:15.872
Yes.

01:32:15.873 --> 01:32:18.332
I'm sure Master Chan
will make sure they behave.

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:20.001
What's the matter?

01:32:20.002 --> 01:32:22.420
I'm not ready to be
a grandmother just yet.

01:32:22.421 --> 01:32:24.297
Ting Ting, are you ready?

01:32:26.216 --> 01:32:28.092
I'll miss you.

01:32:28.093 --> 01:32:30.845
Son-in-law, you better treat her right,

01:32:30.846 --> 01:32:32.597
or I'll come find you.

01:32:32.598 --> 01:32:34.724
I'm virtuous,
so you won't need to worry.

01:32:34.725 --> 01:32:36.559
Are you making a joke?

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.810
You have to respect me now.

01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:39.979
Yes, Dad.

01:32:41.607 --> 01:32:43.483
Just once, would you smile for me, Dad?

01:32:43.484 --> 01:32:44.942
You wish.

01:32:44.943 --> 01:32:47.278
You're not being fair.

01:32:47.279 --> 01:32:48.863
- Just once?
- Maybe.

01:32:48.864 --> 01:32:50.239
But not now.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.657
It's getting late. We'd better leave.

01:32:51.825 --> 01:32:54.285
Sai Yuk, let's go.

01:32:54.286 --> 01:32:56.704
Bye. I'll be okay.

01:32:56.705 --> 01:32:57.830
We'll write.

01:32:59.333 --> 01:33:00.750
Sai Yuk, behave.

01:33:00.751 --> 01:33:03.836
And remember to stay out of trouble.

01:33:03.837 --> 01:33:05.463
Do you hear me?

01:33:05.464 --> 01:33:06.839
Relax, Mom!

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.549
I'm a married man now!

01:33:11.678 --> 01:33:16.307
Sai Yuk, your father's laughing!

01:33:20.521 --> 01:33:22.313
Hey, there!

01:33:22.314 --> 01:33:24.565
I've got your list right here.
