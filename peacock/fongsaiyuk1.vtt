WEBVTT

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:40.216
Protect His Majesty!

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:41.175
Yes.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.609
Retreat!

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.978
Is that you?

00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:47.742
You're here to assassinate me.

00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:50.745
You're a Han,
yet you rule as a Manchu.

00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:53.623
You will betray your people no more.

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:06.511
If only I could be rid of these dreams.

00:03:06.512 --> 00:03:08.304
Silence.

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:10.598
Send for the assassin, right away.

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:30.201
Sir, can I show you some weapons?

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:31.619
No.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.081
Well, then, how can I help?

00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:41.879
You may help my master.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.923
He has trouble sleeping.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:48.386
Then he should see a doctor,
not a blacksmith.

00:03:48.387 --> 00:03:51.013
A doctor won't help.

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:56.727
My master said
we must kill the dream demon.

00:03:56.895 --> 00:03:59.897
That is the only way.

00:03:59.898 --> 00:04:02.191
What is the name of your master?

00:04:02.192 --> 00:04:06.028
His name is Qianlong,
the Manchu emperor.

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:10.366
Last week, I killed a member
of the Red Flower Society.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:12.201
You did what?

00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:14.203
You killed one of our brothers.

00:04:14.204 --> 00:04:17.123
When he died, he gave a confession

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:22.461
that a certain ironsmith carries with him
a list of names.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:28.009
Yes, but you're never going to see it
because you're going to die now.

00:04:29.344 --> 00:04:30.678
I'm ready.

00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:51.991
Now I must find the others.

00:05:17.768 --> 00:05:22.188
Did you know that Tiger Lu
is sponsoring the sports competition?

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:23.564
Where does he get the money?

00:05:23.565 --> 00:05:25.441
He used to be a thief.

00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:26.901
At least that's what I heard.

00:05:26.902 --> 00:05:29.403
That's right.
He's buying all the land.

00:05:29.404 --> 00:05:31.906
In six months, he'll own half the village

00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:35.493
unless we can find a way to stop
all this incredible insanity.

00:05:35.494 --> 00:05:37.286
I agree with you,

00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:40.122
but Tiger Lu is in league
with the Mandarin.

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:41.332
There's not much we can do.

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:42.792
When a man has that much money,

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:44.168
he can get away with almost anything.

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.671
Why do they all seem to hate my father?

00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:49.131
Because he's a rich man.

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:51.384
Do they know who we are?

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:53.928
I don't think so,
but we should get going.

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:57.014
Hey, look at her. She's beautiful.

00:05:57.015 --> 00:05:58.516
Yeah. Let's go.

00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:01.852
Oh, look.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.646
I think the race is about to start.

00:06:03.647 --> 00:06:04.772
Forget about the race.

00:06:04.773 --> 00:06:06.190
Your father's waiting.

00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:07.650
Hey, hey. You all alone?

00:06:07.651 --> 00:06:10.403
- Let me go.
- Let my mistress pass.

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:12.029
Hey, what's the rush?

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.490
- Didn't I tell you?
- She's pretty.

00:06:14.491 --> 00:06:17.493
Hey, stop bothering me now
or I'll tell my father.

00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:19.745
Whoa. Sure.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.539
Let's go find him. Come on.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.791
Hey, don't touch my sister.

00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:24.875
Leave her alone.

00:06:27.045 --> 00:06:28.504
She's not your sister.

00:06:28.505 --> 00:06:29.630
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.507
I know him. That's Fong Sai Yuk.

00:06:31.508 --> 00:06:33.592
And I know you, too.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.469
So why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.639
How about if we start with you?

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.517
I'm ready.

00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:43.394
Better watch yourself. He's dangerous.

00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:44.645
Go get him.

00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:45.855
- Come on, I'm ready.
- Let's take him.

00:06:45.856 --> 00:06:48.232
Hey! What's going on?

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:49.817
You got some kind of problem?

00:06:49.818 --> 00:06:53.070
Officer, leave him alone.

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:55.698
Okay, tell me what this is about.

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:57.116
What's going on?

00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:58.784
Ask him about it.

00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:02.329
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.665
Stop this nonsense
or go to jail right now.

00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:06.751
- I'm sorry.
- We're very sorry. Very sorry.

00:07:06.752 --> 00:07:07.918
- Yes, of course.
- That's enough.

00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:10.296
- Yes, of course.
- Good-bye, sir. Good-bye.

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.630
- Sorry.
- Good-bye.

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.715
Yeah, right.

00:07:12.716 --> 00:07:16.552
Hey, wise guy.

00:07:16.553 --> 00:07:17.928
We're not done yet.

00:07:18.096 --> 00:07:19.221
What do you say?

00:07:19.222 --> 00:07:20.765
Meet me on the race track.

00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:22.725
We'll see who's a man.

00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:24.351
You'll win.

00:07:24.352 --> 00:07:26.729
I can already see him sweat.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.813
Right?

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.565
Better not.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:31.484
Last year he took first prize.

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:32.568
So what?

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:34.612
Sai Yuk knows kung fu.

00:07:34.613 --> 00:07:37.281
What's the matter? He's afraid.

00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:38.949
What? He can beat you.

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:41.160
Right, brother?

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:42.995
Let's do it.

00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:45.831
6 meters.

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:48.959
Next up, last year's champion,

00:07:49.127 --> 00:07:51.170
Yao Chen Chi.

00:07:53.548 --> 00:07:56.217
8 1/2 meters.

00:07:56.218 --> 00:07:59.220
A new record!

00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:02.598
Our next competitor is a new contestant.

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:05.684
His name is Fong Sai Yuk.

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:15.361
What was that?

00:08:18.782 --> 00:08:20.658
Hey, there, little brother.

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:21.951
What are you doing?

00:08:21.952 --> 00:08:24.662
Why, I could have crushed you.

00:08:33.088 --> 00:08:34.463
He cleared the pit!

00:08:34.464 --> 00:08:35.923
A new world record!

00:08:35.924 --> 00:08:38.467
I knew he'd win.

00:08:38.468 --> 00:08:41.470
So, how'd you like the ride?

00:08:42.764 --> 00:08:47.268
All right, let's see
how fast you are in the relay.

00:08:48.937 --> 00:08:50.688
Sai, what do we do?

00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:52.606
- There's only three of us.
- It's for four men.

00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:55.943
Four?

00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:02.700
Miss, can you help us?

00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:05.911
The relay race, it's for four people.

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:07.329
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.498
But I don't run.

00:09:09.499 --> 00:09:12.710
I bet you're faster than an ant.

00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:13.878
Probably.

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.754
Let's go then. Come on.

00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:21.260
You, go first.

00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:22.386
Let me start.

00:09:22.387 --> 00:09:23.512
Why not?

00:09:23.513 --> 00:09:25.848
Runners, take your mark.

00:09:25.849 --> 00:09:27.516
Ready? Go!

00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:28.893
Run! Go!

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:30.519
- Yes! Run!
- Run!

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.520
- Fast!
- Run!

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.526
- Run, run, run!
- Yeah! Great! Faster!

00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:38.736
- Come on!
- Move it! Move it!

00:09:38.737 --> 00:09:40.863
- Come on, Bo! Hurry!
- Let's go!

00:09:40.864 --> 00:09:41.989
Come on!

00:09:50.332 --> 00:09:53.250
Come on! Come on!

00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:54.877
Your turn.

00:09:54.878 --> 00:09:57.004
- I can't.
- Run like the wind. Go!

00:10:01.092 --> 00:10:02.760
Quick! Stand up!

00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:04.303
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.346
Come on!

00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:13.354
- Get going!
- Run faster!

00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:14.897
What's the matter?
You're too slow...

00:10:14.898 --> 00:10:17.691
Faster! Come on, faster!

00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:29.536
You were great.

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:36.377
He's going to win it.

00:10:50.058 --> 00:10:52.226
- All right! Come on!
- Faster!

00:10:52.227 --> 00:10:53.769
Faster!

00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:09.994
He's winning. Keep going!

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:24.174
- You're the winner!
- You did it!

00:11:24.342 --> 00:11:26.302
We won the championships!

00:11:34.936 --> 00:11:36.729
Hey, here's the medal we won.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.855
I thought that you might like it.

00:11:39.357 --> 00:11:40.566
Don't you like it?

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:42.985
No. It's from Lu. Forget it.

00:11:42.986 --> 00:11:44.987
What's your name?

00:11:44.988 --> 00:11:46.113
It's Ling.

00:11:47.365 --> 00:11:49.867
- Hey, you! That's not fair!
- Please, the race is over.

00:11:49.868 --> 00:11:51.660
Yeah, but the fight isn't.

00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:52.870
Get them.

00:12:25.737 --> 00:12:27.446
Who else wants to fight?

00:12:54.265 --> 00:12:55.599
Want some more?

00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:00.813
- Thank you, all of you.
- You're not so tough, are you?

00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:02.523
- Break it up. Break it up.
- Big man.

00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:04.149
All right, what's the fight about?

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.652
See? All of them
were fighting, not us.

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:08.028
We'll see about that.

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:09.947
- Come on, lock them up.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:09.948 --> 00:13:11.365
Okay, let's round them up.

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:13.200
- What?
- Same for you.

00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:14.701
Let's go.

00:13:14.702 --> 00:13:15.828
Come on, they started it.

00:13:19.124 --> 00:13:21.291
Come on, let's go.

00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:25.212
Damn it!

00:13:25.213 --> 00:13:27.131
He's a snake!

00:13:27.132 --> 00:13:30.551
The nerve of that peasant
refusing to sell me his land.

00:13:30.552 --> 00:13:33.804
After I bought the adjoining property.

00:13:33.805 --> 00:13:35.097
No matter.

00:13:35.098 --> 00:13:36.306
I control the water.

00:13:36.474 --> 00:13:38.809
Without my stream,
it is a worthless property.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.811
We'll put up a damn, then he'll sell.

00:13:40.812 --> 00:13:42.396
Yes, sir.

00:13:42.397 --> 00:13:44.314
Your Highness, changing the stream

00:13:44.482 --> 00:13:47.025
is going to put you
in even deeper water.

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:49.903
The people must learn to respect me.

00:13:49.904 --> 00:13:55.200
They must have respect,
but you know what is said.

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:56.660
When the lion is hungry,

00:13:56.661 --> 00:14:01.081
he must go into the forest
to entice home his prey.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:04.835
Get these people to trust you,

00:14:04.836 --> 00:14:09.339
and then you should hold
a kung fu tournament.

00:14:09.507 --> 00:14:12.009
The winner will earn
your daughter's hand in marriage.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.553
Is this really necessary?

00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:16.763
Maybe she won't want to marry the winner.

00:14:16.764 --> 00:14:19.600
Can't you see what I'm getting at?

00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:21.935
It's the only way to do this right.

00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:23.854
You just have to show them.

00:14:23.855 --> 00:14:26.273
You can be like a father to them.

00:14:26.274 --> 00:14:29.234
So, if your daughter
marries one of them,

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:32.279
the rest of them
will give you what you want.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.989
Damn it!

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.158
Don't you think I know that?

00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:37.367
What are we waiting for?

00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:38.660
You're right.

00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:40.162
Great idea.

00:14:40.163 --> 00:14:41.788
Tell everyone.

00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:43.248
Prepare the tournament.

00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:48.837
Sai Yuk, we can't tell anyone
we spent the day in jail.

00:14:48.838 --> 00:14:50.005
Don't worry.

00:14:50.006 --> 00:14:51.632
Sing's right. My parents will be mad.

00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:53.383
Relax. I gave them false names.

00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:55.469
You're Yin Quai,
and you're Lao Chun.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.054
- What about you?
- What about you?

00:14:57.055 --> 00:14:58.639
I am Wong Jing.

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:02.351
Right?

00:15:02.352 --> 00:15:04.561
I have to go home now.

00:15:04.562 --> 00:15:05.896
My mother is waiting for me.

00:15:05.897 --> 00:15:07.105
See you tomorrow.

00:15:10.235 --> 00:15:11.401
Look at that there.

00:15:11.402 --> 00:15:12.486
It's beautiful.

00:15:12.487 --> 00:15:16.156
I love her hairstyle.

00:15:16.157 --> 00:15:18.784
And those dark glasses are charming.

00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:24.957
I won't be able to see a thing,

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.667
but I bet I'll look great.

00:15:29.045 --> 00:15:31.338
I wonder how I look.

00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:35.509
Hello there.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.928
You scared me.

00:15:37.929 --> 00:15:39.054
So sorry.

00:15:39.055 --> 00:15:41.765
It's just... your beauty,
it distracted me.

00:15:41.766 --> 00:15:42.933
Oh, my.

00:15:42.934 --> 00:15:47.229
And your glasses are so unusual.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.816
Could you show me this fabric?

00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:51.900
Right here.

00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:54.945
- That one?
- Yes.

00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:57.447
What a cheapskate.

00:15:57.615 --> 00:16:00.117
Here. That's the one.

00:16:00.118 --> 00:16:01.201
I've got it.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.787
How long?

00:16:03.788 --> 00:16:05.455
Just a little bit.

00:16:05.623 --> 00:16:07.457
Right there.

00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:08.667
Right about there.

00:16:08.668 --> 00:16:10.252
- There?
- About... Yes.

00:16:10.253 --> 00:16:11.503
- There?
- Right... That's right.

00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:12.713
- That short?
- Yes, that's about right.

00:16:12.714 --> 00:16:13.797
Yeah.

00:16:13.798 --> 00:16:15.382
It sure is small.

00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:22.472
Wait!

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.224
- He's a thief!
- You're late.

00:16:24.225 --> 00:16:25.475
Mom, I'm serious.

00:16:25.476 --> 00:16:26.560
- He's stealing.
- Hey, what's going on?

00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:27.811
Shut up.

00:16:27.812 --> 00:16:28.895
- Mom.
- My money's good.

00:16:28.896 --> 00:16:30.439
Hey, you look great.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.481
Get to work, now.

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:33.275
Okay.

00:16:33.276 --> 00:16:34.401
Is he your son?

00:16:34.402 --> 00:16:36.194
Chinese boys today.

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:37.279
Is this my fabric?

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.656
You're not blind. You can see.

00:16:39.657 --> 00:16:41.033
Of course I can.

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.659
How do you suppose I hit you?

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.286
Well, I'd better get going.

00:16:44.287 --> 00:16:45.329
Bye!

00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:53.086
Here.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.385
Mom. Are you an assassin?

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:01.511
He's okay.

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:02.804
The fruit's not ripe.

00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:04.264
Really?

00:17:04.265 --> 00:17:05.599
See?

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.850
It barely pierced the apple.

00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:10.812
Easy. Easy. Easy.

00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:13.357
Whoa. 3 inches.

00:17:13.358 --> 00:17:15.275
It almost went through all the way.

00:17:15.276 --> 00:17:16.234
I must be slipping.

00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:19.988
She's crazy.

00:17:19.989 --> 00:17:21.531
Okay, let's go home.

00:17:21.532 --> 00:17:23.367
Mom, it's the second time this week.

00:17:23.368 --> 00:17:24.993
This will get us in trouble.

00:17:24.994 --> 00:17:27.579
Not if we don't tell your father, it won't.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.874
Hey, Ma, I met a beautiful girl today.

00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:33.001
- She's great.
- Really?

00:17:33.002 --> 00:17:34.086
What eyes.

00:17:34.087 --> 00:17:35.170
Maybe we'll take tomorrow off.

00:17:35.171 --> 00:17:36.713
Now I'm in trouble.

00:17:40.301 --> 00:17:42.302
Young Master, I have bad news.

00:17:42.303 --> 00:17:44.012
The house is full of people.

00:17:44.013 --> 00:17:45.138
Who are they?

00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:47.808
It's the Mandarin
and all of his emissaries.

00:17:47.809 --> 00:17:49.768
You're right, that is bad news.

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:50.852
What's the matter?

00:17:50.853 --> 00:17:53.271
Well, I was in a fight today.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:56.024
Fine. Let me do the talking.

00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:59.653
Esteemed Governor,
wise councilmen,

00:17:59.654 --> 00:18:01.446
I'll settle this matter.

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:03.865
Mr. Fong, you are very honorable.

00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:05.200
I'm quite ashamed.

00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:07.994
I think they both need to be punished.

00:18:07.995 --> 00:18:11.123
I assure you,
I'll take care of this matter.

00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:13.667
What a wonderful surprise.

00:18:13.668 --> 00:18:17.087
Most esteemed Governor
and loyal friends.

00:18:17.088 --> 00:18:19.381
Let me prepare a meal
in honor of your presence.

00:18:19.382 --> 00:18:21.633
Such dishonor.

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:24.261
Today you almost killed our customer.

00:18:24.262 --> 00:18:26.847
- What?
- That's right.

00:18:26.848 --> 00:18:28.598
And her swordplay scared my wife

00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:30.559
- and made her cry.
- He's right.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.146
And that cloth my wife bought,
it fell apart before she got home.

00:18:34.147 --> 00:18:36.064
- Yeah!
- And she calls me an old goat.

00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:38.900
- Yes! It's true!
- That's right!

00:18:38.901 --> 00:18:40.402
So explain yourself.

00:18:40.403 --> 00:18:42.487
You'll hit me even if I do.

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:44.239
Macu, a fresh stick.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.158
I'm ready.

00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:55.000
Please, master.

00:18:56.294 --> 00:18:58.879
So sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry.

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:07.679
Please, Dad, no!

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.139
Not Mom.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.182
Hit me.

00:19:13.311 --> 00:19:14.936
He loves you, doesn't he?

00:19:14.937 --> 00:19:17.189
Is this the home of Fong Sai Yuk?

00:19:21.486 --> 00:19:23.028
Yep, that's him.

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:24.112
Now arrest him.

00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:25.280
What's going on?

00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:27.282
Today I arrested him for fighting.

00:19:27.283 --> 00:19:29.367
At the jailhouse
he gave me a false name.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.162
You lying little...

00:19:36.918 --> 00:19:38.627
That hurts.

00:19:38.628 --> 00:19:42.255
It would have been a lot worse
if I hadn't shielded you.

00:19:42.256 --> 00:19:44.633
Ma, you're so good at kung fu.

00:19:44.634 --> 00:19:46.676
Why do you let him
beat you up like that?

00:19:46.677 --> 00:19:49.221
Your father's pride
is bigger than mine.

00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:52.224
And besides,
he's always careful not to hurt me.

00:19:53.309 --> 00:19:55.310
Whoa! What did I do now?

00:19:55.311 --> 00:19:57.479
Good night.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.442
Good night, Dad.

00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:06.488
He learns his fighting from you.

00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:08.907
He's not a boy anymore.

00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:12.285
It's time he learned
to stay out of trouble.

00:20:12.286 --> 00:20:15.622
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:25.048
All you care about is business
and the idle gossip of our neighbors.

00:20:25.049 --> 00:20:27.175
I have feelings, too.

00:20:27.176 --> 00:20:29.719
Every day is the same.

00:20:29.887 --> 00:20:32.722
You don't care about me.

00:20:32.723 --> 00:20:35.517
And you're always late for dinner.

00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:38.311
What's the matter?

00:20:38.312 --> 00:20:39.396
Forget it.

00:20:39.397 --> 00:20:41.064
I need you.

00:20:41.065 --> 00:20:43.483
No, you don't. You don't mean it.

00:20:46.237 --> 00:20:50.782
And the little bird flew away...

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:54.327
...and left her poor lover alone.

00:20:56.581 --> 00:21:01.751
And his heart was broken,
for only she could make him happy.

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:06.631
His poetry makes me tingle all over.

00:21:08.384 --> 00:21:10.969
Are you still angry with me?

00:21:13.389 --> 00:21:15.432
Did you like my poem?

00:21:15.433 --> 00:21:17.267
Yeah.

00:21:17.268 --> 00:21:18.768
Then follow me.

00:21:18.936 --> 00:21:22.105
It's time for bed.

00:21:22.106 --> 00:21:23.732
All right.

00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:37.787
What's going on over there?

00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:40.415
What does it say?

00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:42.792
Look! It's starting.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.045
Look! Get that.

00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:47.589
Incredible!

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.425
Although I am a newcomer here,

00:21:50.426 --> 00:21:54.346
I want you to know that Tiger
is just like all of you.

00:21:54.347 --> 00:21:58.099
So I have decided to hold
a kung fu competition

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.601
to find a son-in-law.

00:21:59.602 --> 00:22:04.314
Whoever can beat my wife
can marry my beautiful daughter.

00:22:04.315 --> 00:22:08.985
As soon as the contestant's feet
touch the ground, the fight is over.

00:22:08.986 --> 00:22:10.904
Oh, look, she's unhappy.

00:22:10.905 --> 00:22:16.034
And now meet my wife, Siu Wan.

00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:17.535
Look!

00:22:27.838 --> 00:22:31.633
When I marry her, and you'll see,
we'll never sleep.

00:22:31.634 --> 00:22:32.926
Come on, you won't win.

00:22:32.927 --> 00:22:34.219
You just watch me.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.929
- Okay, let's go sign up.
- I want to sign up.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.306
- Come on.
- Let's go.

00:22:38.307 --> 00:22:39.808
Come on, hurry up.

00:22:39.809 --> 00:22:41.851
- Where's Sai Yuk?
- He's studying at home.

00:22:42.019 --> 00:22:43.228
Come on, let's go.

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:44.396
Hey, out of our way!

00:22:44.397 --> 00:22:45.814
Come on, move it!

00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:47.315
Put it in the back of the wagon.

00:22:47.316 --> 00:22:48.566
Where's Fong?

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.777
He's inside studying.

00:22:50.778 --> 00:22:52.654
- I'll be back later.
- Don't be long.

00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:56.825
"After the rain, the flowers will fall

00:22:56.826 --> 00:22:59.327
from the sky above..."

00:22:59.328 --> 00:23:01.287
Hey, who is it?

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:05.041
- They're having a kung fu fight.
- For sure you'll win.

00:23:05.042 --> 00:23:06.459
Come on. You must hurry.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.586
How's your studying going, Sai Yuk?

00:23:12.842 --> 00:23:15.844
"...the mountaintop.

00:23:15.845 --> 00:23:18.346
"The cherry blossoms

00:23:18.347 --> 00:23:21.641
are falling from the..."

00:23:21.642 --> 00:23:22.851
Dad.

00:23:22.852 --> 00:23:25.854
Sai Yuk, sit down.

00:23:25.855 --> 00:23:26.938
I must go.

00:23:26.939 --> 00:23:30.525
About how long? Why?

00:23:30.526 --> 00:23:34.362
- Please, son, keep studying.
- Okay.

00:23:34.363 --> 00:23:37.323
Good. I'll return shortly.

00:23:40.536 --> 00:23:43.204
Guys, he's gone.

00:23:43.205 --> 00:23:44.497
What about the fight?

00:23:44.498 --> 00:23:46.374
It's a kung fu battle for Lu's daughter.

00:23:46.375 --> 00:23:47.917
- The winner gets to marry her.
- Really?

00:23:48.085 --> 00:23:50.920
Yeah. Lu says that his wife's
the best fighter in Canton.

00:23:51.088 --> 00:23:52.297
He said that?

00:23:52.298 --> 00:23:53.757
I'm about to surprise him.

00:23:53.758 --> 00:23:54.924
Master, please.

00:23:55.092 --> 00:23:57.927
Why are you worried about
a kung fu competition?

00:23:58.095 --> 00:23:59.429
Come on.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.181
Yeah, Fong. You can beat anyone.

00:24:01.182 --> 00:24:04.350
Master, your father's
coming to say good-bye.

00:24:05.686 --> 00:24:07.645
Here, put this on.

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:08.897
He'll think you're me.

00:24:08.898 --> 00:24:11.107
I got to go.

00:24:11.108 --> 00:24:15.820
But, Master, I'm much too fat!

00:24:33.547 --> 00:24:35.632
- Master, I have some bad news.
- What's that?

00:24:35.633 --> 00:24:38.259
Ting Ting his disappeared.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.428
What? No!

00:24:40.429 --> 00:24:42.597
Who's next? Come on.

00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:45.767
Damn it, man! Crap.

00:24:48.729 --> 00:24:51.147
You'll do. Come here.

00:24:51.148 --> 00:24:53.525
Our first challenger has been defeated.

00:24:53.526 --> 00:24:55.944
Will the second challenger
please come forward?

00:24:55.945 --> 00:24:57.278
Stop looking.

00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:58.655
What?

00:24:58.656 --> 00:25:00.281
What an idea.

00:25:00.282 --> 00:25:01.574
Patience, sir.

00:25:01.575 --> 00:25:03.118
You'll see.

00:25:10.459 --> 00:25:13.461
Hey. You okay?

00:25:13.462 --> 00:25:15.213
She can't be that good.

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:17.298
She fights like a man.

00:25:17.299 --> 00:25:19.592
I guess you'll find yourself
in a single bed.

00:25:21.762 --> 00:25:23.972
Hey, people, come on.

00:25:23.973 --> 00:25:25.473
Isn't there one of you here

00:25:25.474 --> 00:25:28.101
who can beat
my beautiful wife Siu Wan?

00:25:28.102 --> 00:25:30.687
There are no heroes left in Canton.

00:25:30.688 --> 00:25:32.480
Hey, that's what you think.

00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:34.816
- I'll win your prize.
- What's your name?

00:25:34.817 --> 00:25:37.861
What's my name?

00:25:37.862 --> 00:25:40.113
Just ask anyone here.

00:25:40.114 --> 00:25:41.573
They'll tell you my name.

00:25:41.574 --> 00:25:42.615
Fong Sai Yuk.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.203
Siu Wan, take him now!

00:25:52.501 --> 00:25:54.627
- Are you the prize?
- Of course not.

00:25:54.628 --> 00:25:55.712
She's over there.

00:25:55.713 --> 00:25:57.046
Let's have a look-see.

00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:05.740
Look, madam, both feet
are off the ground. See?

00:27:12.164 --> 00:27:14.249
I think we have a winner.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.722
Get ready.

00:27:29.723 --> 00:27:31.099
I think I'm going to need some help.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.768
Get her off!

00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:34.852
Get off!

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:36.479
Don't worry. I can help.

00:28:10.764 --> 00:28:12.140
Come on. Stop joking.

00:28:38.792 --> 00:28:39.917
Get ready.

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:42.211
Hold on tight.

00:28:42.212 --> 00:28:43.880
Come on! Someone help her!

00:28:45.966 --> 00:28:50.011
Hey, they're helping her.

00:28:50.012 --> 00:28:52.180
Aw, come on.

00:28:52.181 --> 00:28:54.265
I'm about to win.

00:29:00.689 --> 00:29:02.273
Now, wait. All right, now.

00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:04.359
Whoa, hold it. Hang on.

00:29:21.543 --> 00:29:23.127
He's going to fall.

00:29:31.053 --> 00:29:33.346
She's got imagination.

00:29:33.347 --> 00:29:37.225
Hey, some of these people
are on our side.

00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:41.062
Well, you feel okay?

00:29:41.063 --> 00:29:42.188
Just great. Come on.

00:29:42.189 --> 00:29:43.898
I'm behind you. Beat her.

00:29:43.899 --> 00:29:46.275
You've fought well. Now it's my turn.

00:29:46.443 --> 00:29:48.653
Okay. It's about time
you landed on your head.

00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:49.737
Get ready.

00:29:49.738 --> 00:29:51.447
Yeah!

00:29:51.448 --> 00:29:52.782
Take him, Siu Wan.

00:30:05.921 --> 00:30:08.464
Come on, you're making me too tired.

00:30:08.465 --> 00:30:10.633
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.935
Hey! That hurts!

00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:22.395
Watch it, Bo.

00:30:22.396 --> 00:30:24.313
I'm trying.

00:30:24.314 --> 00:30:25.314
She's safe.

00:30:25.482 --> 00:30:26.649
Come on.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.276
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:31:01.768 --> 00:31:03.269
Bo, catch me!

00:31:05.314 --> 00:31:06.898
Your feet haven't
touched the ground, Fong.

00:31:06.899 --> 00:31:08.524
I'm going to finish
this woman off right now.

00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:29.212
She's falling!

00:31:36.803 --> 00:31:38.179
Sai Yuk, are you okay?

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.597
Why did you catch her?

00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:41.390
Did you get a look at the daughter?

00:31:41.391 --> 00:31:42.683
Come on, let's go.

00:31:42.684 --> 00:31:44.018
What about the girl?

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:46.270
Don't worry. I'll be back.

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:48.356
And next time, I'll win.

00:31:48.357 --> 00:31:51.484
Young man, wait!

00:31:51.485 --> 00:31:53.027
Damn it!

00:31:53.028 --> 00:31:57.114
Mom, Fong Sai Yuk just lost
a kung fu match to a woman.

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:58.950
Ah, your boy.

00:31:58.951 --> 00:32:00.576
But no one beats him in fights.

00:32:00.577 --> 00:32:01.994
He never loses.

00:32:03.205 --> 00:32:06.165
It's those damn Lus.

00:32:07.876 --> 00:32:10.002
All right, who's next?

00:32:10.003 --> 00:32:13.589
Anyone else interested?

00:32:14.883 --> 00:32:16.884
Speak up. Come on, let's go.

00:32:20.347 --> 00:32:22.431
Wait a minute.

00:32:22.432 --> 00:32:25.893
Here's a wager that says
I can win this fight.

00:32:25.894 --> 00:32:28.646
Lend me your backs and I'll win for us all.

00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:30.565
I am your...

00:32:32.734 --> 00:32:33.693
hero.

00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:38.823
You seem very confident.

00:32:38.824 --> 00:32:40.866
And you are quite beautiful.

00:32:40.867 --> 00:32:43.953
Save your flirting
and get on with the show.

00:32:47.416 --> 00:32:49.458
So, how about it?

00:32:49.626 --> 00:32:51.294
Let me see.

00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:54.213
Should we?

00:32:54.214 --> 00:32:56.048
Let's get something straight.

00:32:56.049 --> 00:32:57.550
I didn't come here to play a game.

00:32:57.551 --> 00:32:59.302
Okay.

00:33:03.765 --> 00:33:05.558
I'm Fong Tai Yuk.

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:07.018
Braggart.

00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:08.936
Humility doesn't run in your family.

00:33:08.937 --> 00:33:11.439
Seems to be a big problem
in your family.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.773
Come on, let's get going.

00:33:12.774 --> 00:33:14.692
Your husband's a fool.

00:33:21.283 --> 00:33:23.784
You have very good footwork.

00:33:23.785 --> 00:33:25.745
Only the best.

00:33:57.944 --> 00:34:00.237
Afraid that I might bite?

00:34:02.824 --> 00:34:03.866
Don't drop me.

00:34:05.285 --> 00:34:06.535
I can't hold you forever.

00:34:06.703 --> 00:34:08.537
Do you give up?

00:34:08.705 --> 00:34:11.540
If you do, I'll save your life.

00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:12.792
Hang on.

00:34:12.793 --> 00:34:14.168
I've won!

00:34:14.169 --> 00:34:15.461
Look out!

00:34:17.506 --> 00:34:20.466
Ladies first!

00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:32.269
It's over.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.229
You're on the ground now.

00:34:35.357 --> 00:34:36.482
That wasn't bad.

00:34:36.483 --> 00:34:39.151
It was perfect.

00:34:39.152 --> 00:34:40.528
Release her!

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.197
Now let's get on with the ceremony.

00:34:43.198 --> 00:34:46.033
Thank you. Thank you.

00:34:46.034 --> 00:34:48.285
You make the Fong family very happy.

00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:49.912
Ah, now for your reward.

00:34:51.748 --> 00:34:53.624
I want nothing.

00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:55.584
But my daughter needs a husband.

00:34:55.752 --> 00:34:57.378
So get another.

00:34:57.379 --> 00:34:59.088
I came to fight.

00:34:59.089 --> 00:35:02.425
Hey, what's your story?

00:35:02.426 --> 00:35:04.468
Good-bye.

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:05.845
Don't worry.

00:35:05.846 --> 00:35:07.096
You will change your mind.

00:35:16.898 --> 00:35:20.109
- Who are you?
- I'm your mother, Sai Yuk.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.154
Mom, wow.

00:35:23.155 --> 00:35:24.572
You really look like a man.

00:35:24.573 --> 00:35:27.366
Yeah, and I just won Tiger Lu's daughter's
hand in marriage.

00:35:27.367 --> 00:35:29.577
- Does Dad know?
- No.

00:35:29.578 --> 00:35:31.620
Then why are you acting so worried?

00:35:31.621 --> 00:35:34.248
Because Tiger Lu is going
to force me to marry her.

00:35:34.249 --> 00:35:35.624
I've got to get going.

00:35:35.792 --> 00:35:37.918
But, Mom, it'll be funny.

00:35:37.919 --> 00:35:39.003
Come on.

00:35:39.004 --> 00:35:40.379
- Please.
- Here comes Tiger Lu!

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.173
It's him. Let's escape.

00:35:42.174 --> 00:35:43.257
We'd better not.

00:35:43.258 --> 00:35:44.633
- Plan B?
- Yeah.

00:35:52.225 --> 00:35:54.977
Tai Yuk, it's about time.

00:35:54.978 --> 00:35:57.438
Find him.

00:35:57.439 --> 00:35:59.482
What's wrong with you?

00:36:00.817 --> 00:36:06.197
Where are you?

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.491
Go find him!

00:36:08.492 --> 00:36:09.658
We're going this way.

00:36:09.826 --> 00:36:12.119
- Come with me.
- Look over there.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.078
Come here.

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:19.585
Don't look.

00:36:19.586 --> 00:36:20.878
What's the matter?

00:36:23.465 --> 00:36:24.673
Why are you crying?

00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:26.175
He's dead, all right?

00:36:26.176 --> 00:36:28.594
Tai Yuk? Can you be sure?

00:36:28.595 --> 00:36:30.846
I'm telling you, he's dead.

00:36:30.847 --> 00:36:32.139
We cremated him today.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.975
What? That can't be true.
Where is he?

00:36:34.976 --> 00:36:37.144
I was just about to bury him.

00:36:37.145 --> 00:36:39.313
Give him this.

00:36:39.314 --> 00:36:41.565
Okay. You ready?

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:48.072
I'll be right behind you.

00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:49.031
I've got you!

00:36:50.283 --> 00:36:51.617
Hey, you're not a girl.

00:36:51.618 --> 00:36:53.494
That's very rude.

00:36:53.495 --> 00:36:55.996
Want to dance with me?

00:36:55.997 --> 00:36:58.374
Go on! Run away!

00:36:58.375 --> 00:37:00.501
Sai Yuk, that's not going to stop him.

00:37:00.502 --> 00:37:02.461
- Oh, well.
- Come on...

00:37:06.299 --> 00:37:07.258
Get him!

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.055
He's on the roof!

00:37:15.976 --> 00:37:18.060
Look what I've caught.

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.690
Ma!

00:37:22.691 --> 00:37:25.192
Fong, save yourself. Just go.

00:37:25.193 --> 00:37:27.194
No way. You need my protection.

00:37:27.195 --> 00:37:28.153
I'll be right there.

00:37:29.364 --> 00:37:30.573
Close it up!

00:37:30.574 --> 00:37:32.575
He's ours!

00:37:32.576 --> 00:37:34.743
Now, that'll stop your running.

00:37:34.744 --> 00:37:36.203
Wouldn't you rather
be married than dead?

00:37:36.204 --> 00:37:37.746
Sir, I have good news.

00:37:37.914 --> 00:37:39.039
Your daughter has returned.

00:37:41.376 --> 00:37:42.751
See? Get ready!

00:37:42.919 --> 00:37:44.503
You have to let him go.

00:37:44.504 --> 00:37:46.589
Otherwise, the whole village
will be against you.

00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:50.426
Nobody's going
to stop this wedding.

00:37:50.427 --> 00:37:52.219
- Let's go.
- Come on, let me out!

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.929
Help her. This isn't fair!

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.765
Go back to your homes.

00:37:56.933 --> 00:37:58.142
We won't go.

00:37:58.143 --> 00:37:59.560
- Let's free Fong ourselves.
- Let's do it!

00:37:59.561 --> 00:38:01.562
Get back.

00:38:01.563 --> 00:38:03.063
Go on.

00:38:03.064 --> 00:38:06.442
Otherwise, you will be arrested.

00:38:09.988 --> 00:38:12.072
Welcome, sir. Come in.

00:38:12.073 --> 00:38:14.533
Sir, the villagers are angry.

00:38:14.534 --> 00:38:16.452
They're demanding Fong's release.

00:38:16.453 --> 00:38:19.747
Maybe I should offer Fong
some money, as a bribe.

00:38:19.748 --> 00:38:22.625
I'd first try to convince the boy

00:38:22.626 --> 00:38:25.544
that getting married
is doing the right thing.

00:38:25.545 --> 00:38:27.421
Yes. Who knows?

00:38:27.422 --> 00:38:29.715
Maybe he'll agree with you.

00:38:29.716 --> 00:38:32.718
Yes. It's time he learns to obey me.

00:38:32.719 --> 00:38:34.762
No, that won't work.

00:38:34.763 --> 00:38:38.432
He'll only agree if he thinks
your motives are honorable.

00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:40.768
Ah, I see. I agree.

00:38:40.769 --> 00:38:43.938
A virtuous man needs love.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:51.779
I'll bet she has a face like her father.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.572
I'll die first.

00:38:53.573 --> 00:38:56.784
If he tries to kiss me, I'll kill him.

00:38:56.785 --> 00:38:59.828
She acts so calm.

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:06.168
Maybe this will get her off my back.

00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:11.173
Oh, no, he's coming this way.

00:39:11.174 --> 00:39:14.426
If he takes one more step, I'll...

00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:21.225
Wow, that was really great...

00:39:21.226 --> 00:39:22.184
Whoa!

00:39:23.269 --> 00:39:25.020
Hey, why are you trying to kill me?

00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:27.398
I won't marry you.

00:39:27.399 --> 00:39:30.025
Don't worry.
You can keep your virtue.

00:39:30.026 --> 00:39:31.110
I love another.

00:39:31.111 --> 00:39:32.861
Good. Let's stop pretending.

00:39:33.029 --> 00:39:34.321
What about your father?

00:39:34.322 --> 00:39:37.324
Well, I'll talk to him
and I'll try to convince him.

00:39:37.325 --> 00:39:39.451
Good luck.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.496
Give that to me.

00:39:42.497 --> 00:39:43.956
Don't worry.

00:39:43.957 --> 00:39:45.624
I don't want your father's money.

00:39:45.625 --> 00:39:48.419
Go on, take it.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.670
It's getting late.

00:39:49.671 --> 00:39:51.547
I'll sleep outside.

00:40:09.107 --> 00:40:13.819
Miss Lu, I told you,
my heart belongs to someone else.

00:40:15.196 --> 00:40:18.073
Maybe you should find her.

00:40:18.074 --> 00:40:19.116
Hey, you're not Miss Lu.

00:40:21.494 --> 00:40:24.246
But I... also love another.

00:40:24.247 --> 00:40:26.331
Another man?

00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:30.377
Tai Yuk... your brother.

00:40:30.378 --> 00:40:31.920
My brother?

00:40:32.088 --> 00:40:33.505
Are you sure?

00:40:33.506 --> 00:40:35.799
He's all I dream about.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.218
I knew when our legs
were intertwined,

00:40:38.219 --> 00:40:41.513
so I wrote this poem for him.

00:40:41.514 --> 00:40:42.681
Please read it.

00:40:42.682 --> 00:40:43.891
A poem?

00:40:43.892 --> 00:40:45.517
But you're married.

00:40:51.608 --> 00:40:55.694
Without him, only sadness remains.

00:41:00.366 --> 00:41:03.869
Boy. What are we going
to do now, Mom?

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.954
She wants to marry you.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.542
You look thin.

00:41:10.543 --> 00:41:11.835
I'm okay.

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:14.296
But I need to tell you something.

00:41:14.297 --> 00:41:16.090
You're not a virgin?

00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:19.426
That's not what I mean.

00:41:19.427 --> 00:41:24.348
Look, Sai Yuk,
it's time for us to escape.

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:26.183
How are we going
to do that when Lu's men

00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:28.185
are watching us all the time?

00:41:28.186 --> 00:41:29.978
I'm never alone.

00:41:30.146 --> 00:41:31.855
They've always got their eyes on me

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:35.317
or they're following me
like a pack of dogs.

00:41:35.318 --> 00:41:37.778
Don't worry. I have a plan.

00:41:37.779 --> 00:41:40.280
First, we'll set Lu's house on fire.

00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:42.282
Then we'll get you out of here.

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:44.785
What?

00:41:44.786 --> 00:41:47.079
Mom, are you all right?

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.206
- Yeah.
- Here.

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:50.624
I want to show you this.

00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:53.627
- What's wrong?
- Don't worry.

00:41:53.628 --> 00:41:55.337
It's a love poem from Madam Lu.

00:41:56.673 --> 00:42:00.551
Siu Wan, tonight I have
a very important guest coming.

00:42:00.552 --> 00:42:02.636
I want everything to go well.

00:42:02.637 --> 00:42:03.929
It's very important.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.347
If there are any problems, send for me.

00:42:05.348 --> 00:42:06.306
As you wish.

00:42:25.285 --> 00:42:28.996
Mom, I don't think
this is such a good plan.

00:42:28.997 --> 00:42:30.539
Run!

00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:38.213
Hurry, Mom!

00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:41.842
They're right there.

00:42:41.843 --> 00:42:44.052
Getting closer.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.512
I'll try to divert them.

00:42:45.513 --> 00:42:46.638
Okay.

00:42:57.358 --> 00:42:59.902
Stop now or they'll go for you.

00:42:59.903 --> 00:43:01.778
Now, what are you doing here?

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:03.155
Get away.

00:43:03.156 --> 00:43:05.365
Wait a minute.

00:43:05.366 --> 00:43:06.909
Tai Yuk?

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:08.035
Is it you?

00:43:08.036 --> 00:43:10.454
Yes. I must talk to you.

00:43:10.455 --> 00:43:13.874
But if the dogs keep barking,
I won't be able to stay.

00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:16.418
Ah, all right. I see.

00:43:16.419 --> 00:43:17.878
Now stop that. Get over here.

00:43:17.879 --> 00:43:19.296
Hurry up. Come on.

00:43:19.297 --> 00:43:21.548
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.

00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:24.384
- Tai Yuk...
- Stop, madam.

00:43:24.385 --> 00:43:28.805
We cannot be together right now.

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:32.226
From the first moment,
I knew that...

00:43:33.728 --> 00:43:38.065
I'd never find another person
I could love like you.

00:43:38.066 --> 00:43:45.364
Alas, it was like a dream come true,
so I wrote this poem.

00:43:45.365 --> 00:43:47.407
Two rivers.

00:43:47.408 --> 00:43:52.621
Sometimes...
when they come together,

00:43:52.622 --> 00:44:00.087
a perfect harmony of strength
and beauty is born.

00:44:00.088 --> 00:44:05.008
But then, they must
leave each other behind

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:06.760
to join the sea.

00:44:06.761 --> 00:44:09.596
Your words are sweet.

00:44:09.597 --> 00:44:11.139
Madam, are you all right?

00:44:11.307 --> 00:44:12.349
I have to go.

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.600
Don't say anything.

00:44:13.601 --> 00:44:16.144
I'll be back when I can.

00:44:17.563 --> 00:44:19.314
Tai Yuk.

00:44:20.692 --> 00:44:22.985
Mistress, do you need help?

00:44:22.986 --> 00:44:24.486
I'm all right.

00:44:24.487 --> 00:44:25.946
Just leave me alone.

00:44:25.947 --> 00:44:27.406
Just go away.

00:44:27.407 --> 00:44:28.365
Don't say that.

00:44:48.553 --> 00:44:52.306
Hey, it's you, the girl from the race.

00:44:54.517 --> 00:44:55.976
You.

00:44:55.977 --> 00:44:59.062
So, are you a prisoner here, too?

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:01.148
Just like you.

00:45:01.149 --> 00:45:04.776
- Well, great.
- Yeah.

00:45:04.777 --> 00:45:08.238
Why didn't you say good-bye to me?

00:45:08.239 --> 00:45:12.576
Well, you and your friends
were so busy celebrating...

00:45:12.577 --> 00:45:13.910
I was too shy.

00:45:14.954 --> 00:45:17.873
Does this mean you like me?

00:45:22.628 --> 00:45:25.172
Here. Your medal.

00:45:25.173 --> 00:45:26.798
You forgot to take it.

00:45:26.799 --> 00:45:28.258
I gave it to you.

00:45:28.259 --> 00:45:30.344
Okay.

00:45:31.637 --> 00:45:33.263
Who goes there?

00:45:33.264 --> 00:45:35.140
You'd better go. Someone's coming.

00:45:35.141 --> 00:45:37.017
I'll see you later.

00:45:37.018 --> 00:45:39.978
Hey! I'll come back for you.

00:45:41.397 --> 00:45:44.316
My spies tell me
the Red Flower Society

00:45:44.317 --> 00:45:48.195
is meeting tonight, in secret.

00:45:48.196 --> 00:45:50.030
I need you both to help me.

00:45:50.031 --> 00:45:54.993
You must find the location of this meeting.

00:45:54.994 --> 00:45:58.038
- Can you do this for me?
- Of course.

00:45:58.039 --> 00:45:59.706
Yes, all right.

00:45:59.707 --> 00:46:01.583
Don't worry. We'll find them.

00:46:01.584 --> 00:46:05.128
It's a real honor
to serve our emperor.

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:10.008
Now, you'd honor me
if you ate my Manchu chicken.

00:46:14.055 --> 00:46:16.264
Ma, what about Dad?

00:46:16.432 --> 00:46:17.557
We have to get out of here.

00:46:17.558 --> 00:46:18.975
Tiger Lu's looking for us.

00:46:22.563 --> 00:46:24.189
We've had it.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:26.191
Let me explain.

00:46:31.697 --> 00:46:34.282
Hold it.

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:37.077
You're going to be married tomorrow.

00:46:37.078 --> 00:46:38.578
And what about you?

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:41.790
Were you going to invite me
to our son's wedding?

00:46:41.791 --> 00:46:43.333
Have you forgotten I'm your husband?

00:46:43.334 --> 00:46:45.836
It's really my fault.

00:46:45.837 --> 00:46:46.920
Go on.

00:46:46.921 --> 00:46:48.255
Stop it.

00:46:48.256 --> 00:46:50.257
This is my problem.

00:46:50.258 --> 00:46:52.759
Well, I thought that
if I won the competition

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.263
that maybe I'd bring honor
back to this family.

00:46:56.264 --> 00:46:58.223
I'm going to run away!

00:46:58.224 --> 00:46:59.307
- I'm so ashamed.
- Mom, stop.

00:46:59.308 --> 00:47:01.101
- It's all my fault.
- Stop!

00:47:01.102 --> 00:47:02.352
- It's all my fault.
- It's not your fault.

00:47:02.353 --> 00:47:03.311
- Let me go.
- Come on. Please.

00:47:03.479 --> 00:47:04.521
All right, all right.

00:47:04.522 --> 00:47:06.064
- Just calm down.
- Let me go.

00:47:06.065 --> 00:47:08.859
When I return, I'll settle this matter.

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:12.112
What? Wait.

00:47:12.113 --> 00:47:14.072
Do you mean you're
going out just when...

00:47:14.073 --> 00:47:15.073
Just when I need you?

00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:28.295
A present.

00:47:40.433 --> 00:47:43.351
Hey, it's a present for me.

00:47:43.519 --> 00:47:45.103
A razor.

00:47:45.104 --> 00:47:46.771
Hey, that's my razor, not yours.

00:47:49.358 --> 00:47:51.067
Hey, Ma, it's raining.

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.360
Get your dad's umbrella.

00:47:52.528 --> 00:47:54.529
- We'll find him.
- All right.

00:47:59.619 --> 00:48:00.702
Come on, you'll get wet.

00:48:00.703 --> 00:48:02.162
Watch out for that puddle.

00:48:02.163 --> 00:48:05.040
Mom, how are we going to find him?

00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:06.541
I don't know.

00:48:06.542 --> 00:48:08.168
We'd better hurry.

00:48:08.169 --> 00:48:10.045
Here, give me that.

00:48:19.472 --> 00:48:24.309
I don't understand why your father
has to meet someone so late at night.

00:48:26.729 --> 00:48:28.063
Look.

00:48:28.064 --> 00:48:30.398
- It's not raining anymore.
- You stop.

00:48:30.566 --> 00:48:32.400
I hear Dad's voice over there.

00:48:32.568 --> 00:48:34.319
I'll try to help you.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.364
Just give me a little time
to work things out.

00:48:37.365 --> 00:48:40.158
Please, stop crying.

00:48:40.159 --> 00:48:42.160
You can trust me.

00:48:42.161 --> 00:48:45.163
Sure. That's what you think.

00:48:45.164 --> 00:48:46.581
Wait a minute. Mom.

00:48:46.582 --> 00:48:48.708
I wish I were dead.

00:48:48.709 --> 00:48:52.003
I won't let you kill yourself.

00:48:52.004 --> 00:48:54.005
Your child isn't born.

00:48:54.006 --> 00:48:56.258
He got her pregnant.

00:48:56.259 --> 00:48:59.719
Lok Ping, this child
is all you have left

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.805
of your dead husband.

00:49:01.806 --> 00:49:02.889
A great man.

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:06.184
Your father isn't the father.

00:49:06.185 --> 00:49:09.187
I'm not surprised, but who are they?

00:49:09.188 --> 00:49:12.065
Your husband died
to protect our names.

00:49:12.066 --> 00:49:14.818
Now I must protect the list.

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:17.404
The Red Flower brotherhood is safe.

00:49:17.405 --> 00:49:21.283
Say, maybe they'll let me join.

00:49:21.284 --> 00:49:23.451
They're probably all going to die.

00:49:23.452 --> 00:49:25.203
It'll be okay, Ma. Don't worry.

00:49:25.204 --> 00:49:26.580
There. Who are you?

00:49:29.917 --> 00:49:31.209
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.669
Hurry!

00:49:38.301 --> 00:49:39.634
Bandits?

00:49:39.635 --> 00:49:40.760
Manchu.

00:49:40.761 --> 00:49:41.928
- The emperor?
- Yeah.

00:49:41.929 --> 00:49:43.305
They're here to kill your father.

00:49:46.976 --> 00:49:49.269
I knew I'd find you.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:52.480
Your brotherhood seeks
to destroy the emperor.

00:49:53.774 --> 00:49:55.942
Every one of you is going to die.

00:49:55.943 --> 00:49:58.111
We'll never give up.

00:49:58.112 --> 00:50:01.489
I am protecting the people against an evil.

00:50:01.657 --> 00:50:04.117
Our country will be destroyed
by Emperor Qianlong.

00:50:04.118 --> 00:50:07.037
You're fighting me now.

00:50:07.038 --> 00:50:09.080
And money's my goal.

00:50:09.081 --> 00:50:12.459
This fight's about freedom,
not about your money.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.838
You are going to have to kill me
to get the list of our names.

00:50:16.839 --> 00:50:20.884
Do you see how great
your father is, Sai Yuk?

00:50:20.885 --> 00:50:23.094
What happened to my son?

00:50:35.983 --> 00:50:37.067
Let's hurry.

00:50:42.448 --> 00:50:43.948
Dad!

00:50:52.875 --> 00:50:54.626
You're dealing with me now,

00:50:54.627 --> 00:50:55.960
so get ready.

00:51:02.885 --> 00:51:04.135
Let's go.

00:51:13.771 --> 00:51:15.689
Not him, you bully.

00:51:36.419 --> 00:51:38.044
Have you got the list?

00:51:38.045 --> 00:51:39.587
Right here.

00:52:03.237 --> 00:52:04.779
You're beating the air now.

00:52:11.912 --> 00:52:13.496
Sai Yuk, over there.

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:14.914
Lok Ping. She's hurt pretty bad.

00:52:14.915 --> 00:52:16.916
Okay.

00:52:16.917 --> 00:52:18.209
Look out!

00:52:25.801 --> 00:52:27.093
Watch out!

00:52:30.806 --> 00:52:33.600
Lady, are you in pain?

00:52:33.601 --> 00:52:34.934
It's okay.

00:52:34.935 --> 00:52:36.728
My baby is going to be all right.

00:52:36.729 --> 00:52:38.146
Father will be very pleased.

00:52:38.147 --> 00:52:41.107
- Support him, all right?
- Yes, I will.

00:52:43.611 --> 00:52:45.820
Come on, Sai Yuk. Let's go.

00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:48.114
I'll follow you.

00:52:48.115 --> 00:52:49.407
Okay. Hurry up.

00:53:34.995 --> 00:53:35.954
That hurts.

00:53:53.347 --> 00:53:55.306
I won't give up.

00:53:55.307 --> 00:53:56.891
More?

00:54:02.064 --> 00:54:04.524
Whew. You had about enough?

00:54:04.525 --> 00:54:05.859
Never!

00:54:19.331 --> 00:54:22.458
Now you'll never beat me.

00:55:19.141 --> 00:55:23.102
I see your stick is too short to win.

00:55:23.103 --> 00:55:25.521
If yours were harder,
it wouldn't bend like that.

00:57:05.497 --> 00:57:07.915
Sai Yuk, were you followed?

00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:10.543
Forget it, Dad. I watched my back.

00:57:11.712 --> 00:57:14.213
What about Mom?

00:57:14.214 --> 00:57:17.050
Your face is red.

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:22.680
Oh, Ma, what's the matter?

00:57:23.766 --> 00:57:24.932
It's your father.

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.977
His poetry is so beautiful.

00:57:27.978 --> 00:57:31.522
I... I don't know why
it seems to make me so happy.

00:57:31.523 --> 00:57:35.568
Aw, that's so wonderful.

00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:38.654
It's no joke. I'm serious.

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:40.573
- Wow.
- It makes me happy.

00:57:40.574 --> 00:57:42.158
What a mystery.

00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:43.910
Sai Yuk!

00:57:43.911 --> 00:57:47.705
Son, you can leave now.

00:57:50.125 --> 00:57:52.794
Father, I don't want to leave you.

00:57:52.795 --> 00:57:55.546
I'm a man now.

00:57:55.547 --> 00:58:00.718
My days as a child are gone, forever.

00:58:00.719 --> 00:58:05.431
It's time for me
to be more responsible.

00:58:05.432 --> 00:58:09.477
Hey, this means I can try
some of my new moves.

00:58:09.478 --> 00:58:10.978
For my country.

00:58:10.979 --> 00:58:13.648
Well, you're going to need my help, too.

00:58:13.649 --> 00:58:15.691
I won't leave, either.

00:58:20.823 --> 00:58:24.492
Now we all must hide
at Tiger Lu's house.

00:58:24.493 --> 00:58:26.577
Dad, you must be kidding.

00:58:26.578 --> 00:58:29.330
They won't look for us there.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.626
You what?

00:58:33.627 --> 00:58:35.753
They both just ran away from my house.

00:58:35.754 --> 00:58:37.088
Right.

00:58:37.089 --> 00:58:38.798
But that was before.

00:58:38.799 --> 00:58:41.217
Now they realize they were wrong.

00:58:41.218 --> 00:58:44.804
Even my naughty son
sees you're a virtuous man.

00:58:44.805 --> 00:58:46.180
They're both sorry.

00:58:46.181 --> 00:58:49.475
So what we would like
is to live here with you

00:58:49.476 --> 00:58:51.853
and maybe become better people.

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:56.691
Of course you can stay with me,

00:58:56.692 --> 00:59:00.695
but you must do as I say
because I am so virtuous.

00:59:05.367 --> 00:59:07.910
Here comes my daughter, Ting Ting.

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:10.621
She's going to make your son a good wife.

00:59:10.622 --> 00:59:12.290
Go on. Go.

00:59:18.797 --> 00:59:21.048
Honey, I've missed you so.

00:59:21.216 --> 00:59:23.551
It's not me, it's her.

00:59:29.308 --> 00:59:30.433
- You?
- You?

00:59:38.025 --> 00:59:40.026
You're real.

00:59:40.027 --> 00:59:41.652
You're right.

00:59:56.084 --> 00:59:59.086
Our son's romantic.

00:59:59.087 --> 01:00:01.422
He learned that from me.

01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:03.633
Come on, stand up.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:05.051
- Come on.
- Wait, wait.

01:00:05.052 --> 01:00:06.844
We can't...

01:00:06.845 --> 01:00:10.389
Ting Ting, I want you to have
this old family treasure

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:12.558
because now you're a part of our family.

01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:14.435
Oh, thank you.

01:00:14.436 --> 01:00:15.937
Very good.

01:00:15.938 --> 01:00:18.105
Everything's arranged.

01:00:18.106 --> 01:00:19.815
Tomorrow's the big wedding.

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:22.902
Even the governor's going to come.

01:00:22.903 --> 01:00:24.737
Oh, so sorry!

01:00:24.738 --> 01:00:25.947
Please, you must excuse me.

01:00:25.948 --> 01:00:27.406
Don't worry.

01:00:27.407 --> 01:00:30.618
It's nothing. See? I'm virtuous.

01:00:30.619 --> 01:00:34.163
Nothing bothers me anymore.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:35.289
Now listen to me.

01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:37.541
We must invite everyone that's important,

01:00:37.542 --> 01:00:40.002
and of course your family,
and have a big wedding.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:42.880
And everyone will come,
and they'll see how virtuous I am.

01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:02.024
Hey, what about the party?

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:04.026
We need some people
to help us celebrate.

01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:09.031
But, uh, I'm sure they'll be here.

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:10.157
You'll see.

01:01:10.158 --> 01:01:11.951
It takes a long time.

01:01:11.952 --> 01:01:13.828
They live far away.

01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:16.497
Sometimes it takes a week
to make the journey.

01:01:16.498 --> 01:01:19.083
Hey, your son knows lots of people.

01:01:19.084 --> 01:01:20.042
What about them?

01:01:22.337 --> 01:01:24.380
He's right. It's true.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:27.341
They would come,
but they're all in prison.

01:01:29.261 --> 01:01:30.469
In prison?

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:33.180
They'd be here if they could.

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:37.518
Master.

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:39.270
It's the governor. He's here.

01:01:39.271 --> 01:01:41.605
At last, someone's finally come.

01:01:42.983 --> 01:01:45.109
Be still.

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:46.652
I'll do the talking.

01:01:46.653 --> 01:01:47.820
He will?

01:01:47.821 --> 01:01:49.530
Welcome, Governor.

01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:50.865
Congratulations.

01:01:50.866 --> 01:01:52.533
I brought a guest.

01:01:52.534 --> 01:01:54.869
You honor me, sir.

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.620
- Whoa.
- Well, time to go.

01:01:56.621 --> 01:01:58.581
Hey, we can all greet the governor.

01:01:58.582 --> 01:01:59.832
- Come on.
- Of course.

01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:01.542
- That's right.
- What now?

01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:02.710
- Come on with me.
- I don't know.

01:02:02.711 --> 01:02:04.795
Please, come in.

01:02:09.509 --> 01:02:11.510
These are my in-laws and my wife.

01:02:11.511 --> 01:02:13.679
- I bow to your honorableness.
- Yes, welcome.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.014
- Please, sit down.
- Yes, have a seat.

01:02:15.015 --> 01:02:16.140
It's an honor to have you here.

01:02:16.141 --> 01:02:18.601
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:19.727
Thank you for coming.

01:02:22.689 --> 01:02:24.648
Please sit.

01:02:27.194 --> 01:02:28.861
Hey, what's wrong?

01:02:28.862 --> 01:02:30.404
Come on and join us.
What's the matter?

01:02:30.405 --> 01:02:33.115
Oh, no. Your table
is much too crowded.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.658
We'd better stay here.

01:02:34.659 --> 01:02:35.993
What is the matter?

01:02:35.994 --> 01:02:38.037
It's not crowded. Come on.

01:02:38.038 --> 01:02:39.872
Hey, I dropped something.

01:02:39.873 --> 01:02:41.415
Good. I'll help him look.

01:02:41.416 --> 01:02:43.459
What is this?

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.211
Now you, sir, come join me.

01:02:45.212 --> 01:02:47.254
Well, Mr. Lu...

01:02:48.924 --> 01:02:50.049
Oh, no, I can't find the money.

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:51.258
Don't worry, son, I'll help you.

01:02:51.426 --> 01:02:52.968
Yep, I think I found it.

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:57.932
What?

01:03:00.894 --> 01:03:02.228
Please forgive them.

01:03:02.229 --> 01:03:04.063
What's the problem?

01:03:04.064 --> 01:03:06.107
Come on. Serve us now.

01:03:08.026 --> 01:03:09.819
Son, it's your favorite.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.570
I'll serve you.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:17.284
Here.

01:03:17.452 --> 01:03:19.912
Oh, Mother.

01:03:19.913 --> 01:03:21.497
Please, move it to the left.

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:22.581
No, to the right.

01:03:22.582 --> 01:03:24.625
No. No, no. To the left.
No, no, no. No, no.

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.502
Back to the right.

01:03:29.923 --> 01:03:31.590
He's a traitor.

01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:33.300
You're lying.

01:03:33.468 --> 01:03:35.302
His babbling dishonors my boy.

01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:36.971
Hey, that's my son-in-law.

01:03:36.972 --> 01:03:38.973
So he's your guest.

01:03:38.974 --> 01:03:40.307
Right.

01:03:40.308 --> 01:03:41.725
This must be a mistake.

01:03:41.726 --> 01:03:42.893
Traitor.

01:03:42.894 --> 01:03:44.186
No!

01:03:45.814 --> 01:03:47.064
Siu Wan!

01:03:47.065 --> 01:03:48.315
Ma!

01:03:48.483 --> 01:03:49.608
Run.

01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:50.985
- Now.
- Better not.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.124
Let me help.

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:06.459
He's a madman!

01:04:07.586 --> 01:04:09.503
- Move it!
- Get cover!

01:04:09.504 --> 01:04:11.297
Get them! Get them!

01:04:11.298 --> 01:04:13.799
- Reload!
- Come on, move it.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.342
I am. Push!

01:04:17.137 --> 01:04:18.804
Master, what now?

01:04:18.805 --> 01:04:20.347
Don't worry. Hurry!

01:04:20.515 --> 01:04:21.849
Fire!

01:04:25.645 --> 01:04:26.729
Ready!

01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:32.985
- Go.
- Move in!

01:04:32.986 --> 01:04:34.528
Hands up!

01:04:34.529 --> 01:04:37.323
Hurry up, you fools,
before they escape.

01:04:41.203 --> 01:04:44.997
Now, you're my hostage.

01:04:44.998 --> 01:04:46.957
They'll be back to get you.

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:52.838
I need to come up with a plan.

01:04:52.839 --> 01:04:55.174
It's all your fault, damn you.

01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:56.592
My life is ruined now!

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:58.469
And the emperor thinks I'm a traitor.

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:00.179
And I have no place to live.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.388
I hate you.

01:05:01.389 --> 01:05:02.556
Please, master.

01:05:02.557 --> 01:05:04.183
It's not Sai Yuk's fault.

01:05:04.184 --> 01:05:05.392
What?

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.019
You want to lose your head?

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.855
Free him and stop your bullying.

01:05:09.856 --> 01:05:12.316
I'll bully anyone I want to.

01:05:12.317 --> 01:05:13.651
Okay, let's fight.

01:05:13.652 --> 01:05:14.902
Don't, please.

01:05:14.903 --> 01:05:17.404
Help me! Mother has a fever!

01:05:19.157 --> 01:05:20.407
Get out of my way.

01:05:20.575 --> 01:05:22.243
Siu Wan, I'm coming!

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:24.828
Most kind.

01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:26.121
Thank you, lady.

01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:30.834
Siu Wan.

01:05:30.835 --> 01:05:32.836
Master, she needs a doctor.

01:05:32.837 --> 01:05:34.505
- Let me help.
- Get away from us.

01:05:34.506 --> 01:05:36.298
Don't touch her.

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:39.969
- Get away.
- I can carry her.

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.680
Take your hands off her.

01:05:42.681 --> 01:05:45.391
- Mother?
- Come on, Ting Ting, let's go.

01:05:45.392 --> 01:05:47.017
She's too weak to walk.

01:05:47.018 --> 01:05:48.894
You go save yourselves.

01:05:48.895 --> 01:05:50.104
We're going on our own.

01:05:50.105 --> 01:05:52.231
Please. I trust her.

01:05:52.232 --> 01:05:54.024
I believe what she's saying.

01:05:54.025 --> 01:05:56.485
Come now or you are
no longer my daughter.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.199
Sai Yuk, good-bye.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.118
Let's go. Now.

01:06:04.119 --> 01:06:07.037
I'm so sorry.

01:06:08.248 --> 01:06:10.374
It'll be all right.

01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:12.293
I'd better do something.

01:06:12.294 --> 01:06:14.253
I'll go back to town.

01:06:14.254 --> 01:06:15.546
What about Dad?

01:06:15.547 --> 01:06:16.880
You must find him.

01:06:32.397 --> 01:06:33.772
Who's there?

01:06:33.773 --> 01:06:35.482
It's Sai Yuk.

01:06:35.483 --> 01:06:38.110
Come on, Sing. Hurry up.

01:06:38.111 --> 01:06:39.486
I think I hear someone.

01:06:39.654 --> 01:06:40.904
Come on, hurry.

01:06:46.286 --> 01:06:50.080
Sing, I saw the notice that they're going
to execute my father tomorrow.

01:06:50.081 --> 01:06:51.415
Can you help me?

01:06:51.416 --> 01:06:53.751
I can't.

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:58.255
I'm scared.

01:06:58.256 --> 01:06:59.506
And poor Bo.

01:06:59.507 --> 01:07:00.799
What? Tell me.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.887
Sai Yuk, everything, it's all my fault.

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:08.515
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

01:07:08.516 --> 01:07:10.643
Come on, you can tell me.

01:07:12.145 --> 01:07:15.147
Some officers took
Bo and me for questioning.

01:07:15.148 --> 01:07:16.523
I told them that I didn't know you,

01:07:16.691 --> 01:07:18.150
but Bo laughed in their faces

01:07:18.151 --> 01:07:20.277
and said he was proud
to be your friend.

01:07:20.278 --> 01:07:21.654
I'm a coward.

01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.531
But where is he?

01:07:24.699 --> 01:07:26.825
He's down by the western gate.

01:07:26.826 --> 01:07:28.327
But he's...

01:07:28.328 --> 01:07:31.497
The officers were tired

01:07:31.498 --> 01:07:35.709
and they wanted Bo to kowtow
before they'd release him,

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:37.544
but... but he refused.

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:40.923
Then what happened?
Then what?

01:07:53.645 --> 01:07:55.854
- Hey, you shouldn't be here.
- You'd better go.

01:07:55.855 --> 01:07:58.023
I've come for my friend.

01:07:58.024 --> 01:07:59.566
You'd better leave now.

01:07:59.734 --> 01:08:02.236
Hey, you look familiar.

01:08:02.237 --> 01:08:03.529
What's your name?

01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:05.072
Fong Sai Yuk.

01:08:05.073 --> 01:08:06.824
Hey, it's him!

01:08:06.825 --> 01:08:08.867
And I'm not leaving
without my friend.

01:08:08.868 --> 01:08:13.747
So you'd better be going,
or else I'll...

01:08:13.748 --> 01:08:15.541
I'll have to fight you.

01:08:15.542 --> 01:08:17.876
- Then we'll fight.
- Yeah, all of us.

01:08:17.877 --> 01:08:19.545
Bo will win this battle.

01:08:19.546 --> 01:08:21.255
Attack him!

01:08:51.244 --> 01:08:54.872
Now... we'll beat them together.

01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:57.958
Let's go!

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:39.166
Now beg him.

01:09:39.167 --> 01:09:40.209
Get down.

01:09:42.295 --> 01:09:44.838
And beg his forgiveness.

01:09:44.839 --> 01:09:47.466
So sorry!

01:09:47.467 --> 01:09:49.885
- Sorry.
- Forgive me.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:52.346
- I'm so sorry.
- Forgive us.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.607
All right. We've won, Bo.

01:10:36.391 --> 01:10:38.684
Good-bye, dear friend.

01:10:38.685 --> 01:10:40.394
I'll never forget you.

01:10:40.395 --> 01:10:44.189
I'm certain we'll meet again
in another life.

01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:46.733
Safe journey.

01:10:46.901 --> 01:10:50.070
Sir, do you need help?

01:10:50.071 --> 01:10:52.197
Macu.

01:10:52.198 --> 01:10:54.366
They're going to execute
my father tomorrow.

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:58.203
Master, we can't allow it.

01:10:58.204 --> 01:11:01.582
I have to rescue him, at once.

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:02.666
You must help me.

01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:06.169
Master, please, I'll do anything,
but they're going to kill you.

01:11:06.170 --> 01:11:08.213
- Please don't do it.
- It's Mother.

01:11:08.214 --> 01:11:10.215
Protect her.

01:11:10.216 --> 01:11:13.302
Please, you can't
tell her about my plan.

01:11:14.554 --> 01:11:17.139
Macu, come on.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.182
It's going to be all right.

01:11:19.183 --> 01:11:22.144
My mother needs you,
and I'll be okay.

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:23.103
So let's go.

01:11:26.024 --> 01:11:28.025
All right.

01:11:28.026 --> 01:11:29.359
Tell me, what about your father?

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.569
I almost forgot.

01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:32.279
I saw him.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.573
He told me to tell you, don't you worry.

01:11:34.574 --> 01:11:35.699
Everything is great.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.783
He said that?

01:11:36.951 --> 01:11:38.994
You better believe it.

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:41.246
But your father wouldn't say that.

01:11:41.247 --> 01:11:45.167
He thought that he would
really make you happy with this.

01:11:45.168 --> 01:11:49.254
You're to meet him with Macu
at Puishi Beach for a holiday.

01:11:49.255 --> 01:11:51.798
Oh, boy.

01:11:51.966 --> 01:11:53.008
Right, Macu?

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:55.761
Come on, I told you
all about his plan.

01:11:55.762 --> 01:11:58.555
Go on, tell her. Come on.

01:11:58.556 --> 01:12:02.100
What he said is true, Mistress.

01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:03.977
But he hates the water.

01:12:03.978 --> 01:12:10.067
Yeah, well, he told me to tell you
that now he wants to be different.

01:12:10.068 --> 01:12:13.278
Okay? isn't what
I'm saying true, Macu?

01:12:13.279 --> 01:12:15.322
Come on, tell her the rest of the story.

01:12:15.323 --> 01:12:16.406
I got it.

01:12:16.407 --> 01:12:19.201
He said it came to him in a dream.

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:23.121
A big fish told him
to learn to swim at Puishi Beach.

01:12:23.122 --> 01:12:24.206
And then it ate him.

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:26.124
You would know.

01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:29.586
Well, that's quite a story.

01:12:29.587 --> 01:12:31.421
They can all go to hell.

01:12:31.422 --> 01:12:35.258
Damn those Cantonese bastards.

01:12:37.303 --> 01:12:41.807
We need a doctor, and instead,
they send an officer to arrest us.

01:12:41.808 --> 01:12:44.017
Can't be trusted, those bastards!

01:12:44.018 --> 01:12:47.270
They're all just a bunch of liars!

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.818
Come on, Macu.

01:12:56.364 --> 01:12:58.824
Ting Ting, come inside our boat.

01:12:58.825 --> 01:13:00.409
Beat it!

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.286
Otherwise, I'll have
those Cantonese bastards

01:13:03.287 --> 01:13:04.871
come and arrest all three of you.

01:13:04.872 --> 01:13:06.456
Stop.

01:13:06.457 --> 01:13:08.458
You better be quiet.

01:13:08.459 --> 01:13:12.212
Please, let me help her,
or she might die.

01:13:12.213 --> 01:13:15.549
Ting Ting, you go.

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:16.717
I won't leave you, Mother.

01:13:16.718 --> 01:13:19.511
Yes, you must go.

01:13:19.512 --> 01:13:21.346
Please let her go.

01:13:21.347 --> 01:13:23.140
It's just your pride.

01:13:23.141 --> 01:13:24.641
She's just trying to protect you.

01:13:25.852 --> 01:13:28.478
Stop your yelping. I know better.

01:13:28.479 --> 01:13:31.690
Just stop talking and help me
get her on this boat

01:13:31.691 --> 01:13:33.525
and out of this damn rain, okay?

01:13:33.526 --> 01:13:35.485
Macu, carry her.

01:13:55.715 --> 01:13:57.591
Siu Wan.

01:13:57.592 --> 01:14:00.260
Why is this happening to me?

01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:02.596
Why are the gods so angry?

01:14:05.892 --> 01:14:07.726
They've given you an answer.

01:14:07.727 --> 01:14:09.102
Come with me, now.

01:14:09.103 --> 01:14:10.937
You'd better get going.

01:14:11.105 --> 01:14:12.439
I'm here, Mother.

01:14:14.192 --> 01:14:18.779
Sai Yuk, Ting Ting outside.

01:14:21.783 --> 01:14:25.285
We need to talk.

01:14:25.286 --> 01:14:28.789
Go. Go on.

01:14:35.254 --> 01:14:39.966
Kind lady, will you please help me?

01:14:41.469 --> 01:14:43.178
Quiet.

01:14:48.267 --> 01:14:50.185
I miss Tai Yuk.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.148
But, dear lady,

01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:57.692
Tai Yuk has returned to you.

01:15:06.452 --> 01:15:11.665
Please, recite a poem.

01:15:13.584 --> 01:15:19.005
Some time in autumn,

01:15:19.173 --> 01:15:22.092
a tiny leaf falls to the ground

01:15:22.093 --> 01:15:25.303
and brings a big snow

01:15:25.304 --> 01:15:27.848
for eternity.

01:15:27.849 --> 01:15:32.769
But you're here, Tai Yuk.

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:35.856
Yes.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:47.242
I'll always...

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:50.078
be right...

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:52.664
beside you.

01:15:52.665 --> 01:15:58.795
In our next life, we'll be man and wife.

01:16:00.673 --> 01:16:02.174
All right.

01:16:14.228 --> 01:16:16.313
Siu Wan.

01:16:18.816 --> 01:16:20.233
Mother!

01:16:20.234 --> 01:16:23.320
Siu Wan!

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.867
Please, sir.

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:32.621
Take my umbrella.

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:40.128
After today, we won't fight anymore
because you are my family.

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:43.381
Macu will take care of you.

01:16:43.382 --> 01:16:45.008
You must go.

01:16:45.009 --> 01:16:49.012
Life will be better
when we leave this place.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.615
All right.

01:17:16.082 --> 01:17:18.917
Siu Wan!

01:17:43.317 --> 01:17:45.777
I won't sleep until I see you.

01:17:45.778 --> 01:17:49.114
So you hurry it up or I'll be mad.

01:17:49.115 --> 01:17:51.783
Master, please take care.

01:17:51.784 --> 01:17:53.159
Stop crying.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.744
God, you're so dramatic.

01:17:54.745 --> 01:17:57.706
What do you think,
he's going to die or something?

01:17:57.707 --> 01:18:00.375
It's just that I'm going to miss him.

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:02.168
No more crying.

01:18:02.336 --> 01:18:05.171
I'll be there in a day, okay?

01:18:05.172 --> 01:18:07.549
Sai Yuk...

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:08.633
take care.

01:18:08.634 --> 01:18:09.759
I will.

01:18:11.262 --> 01:18:12.721
Will you promise something?

01:18:12.722 --> 01:18:14.639
If I can.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.184
If I die, you will always remember me?

01:18:18.185 --> 01:18:21.187
I promise.

01:18:21.188 --> 01:18:23.898
- I won't forget you.
- What's wrong?

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:25.984
I just can't help it.

01:18:25.985 --> 01:18:27.152
I worry.

01:18:27.153 --> 01:18:29.029
About women?

01:18:31.198 --> 01:18:34.492
Please, don't act like this.

01:18:34.493 --> 01:18:36.453
You don't need to worry about us.

01:18:43.127 --> 01:18:45.795
He talks like his father.

01:18:45.796 --> 01:18:49.090
Hey, Mr. Lu, who taught her
how to kiss like that?

01:18:50.801 --> 01:18:52.385
Forget it.

01:18:55.681 --> 01:18:57.098
It's yours.

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:58.475
But why?

01:19:00.186 --> 01:19:02.687
- For luck.
- Then I'll wear it.

01:19:02.688 --> 01:19:04.981
Come on, Ting Ting. We've got to go.

01:19:04.982 --> 01:19:06.983
Good-bye.

01:19:14.825 --> 01:19:18.578
Sai Yuk, remember, I'll be waiting.

01:19:18.579 --> 01:19:20.997
Okay, Mom.

01:19:20.998 --> 01:19:23.541
And be sure you don't forget to eat.

01:19:23.542 --> 01:19:27.253
And remember to stay out of the rain
so you don't catch cold.

01:19:27.421 --> 01:19:30.006
And don't trust any strangers.

01:19:30.007 --> 01:19:33.301
We'll all be waiting
for you at Puishi Beach.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:36.304
Good-bye, Sai Yuk.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:38.556
Young Master, promise you'll hurry.

01:19:38.557 --> 01:19:40.225
I'll be there.

01:20:20.599 --> 01:20:25.395
Now, I'm going to
ask you one more time.

01:20:25.396 --> 01:20:28.690
Give me the list of names,
and you won't die.

01:20:28.691 --> 01:20:31.109
You'll have to kill me, then.

01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:33.319
I won't betray my friends
or my country.

01:20:33.487 --> 01:20:38.158
This man is a liar and a traitor.

01:20:38.159 --> 01:20:42.704
He must die in order
to protect our emperor.

01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:46.833
Now, our economy
is the finest in the world.

01:20:46.834 --> 01:20:49.461
And our people are happy.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.046
He's lying.

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.631
Be quiet.

01:20:53.632 --> 01:20:55.925
Unless you want to die as well.

01:20:57.219 --> 01:21:00.054
- It's time.
- Let's go.

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.648
This is wrong.

01:21:10.649 --> 01:21:13.359
I know him. He's a good man.

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:20.658
Chop.

01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:17.549
Stop him!

01:22:20.719 --> 01:22:21.928
Sai Yuk!

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:37.902
Get back.

01:22:37.903 --> 01:22:40.947
I've got dynamite, okay?

01:22:40.948 --> 01:22:42.031
Hold it.

01:22:42.032 --> 01:22:45.451
Give up. You won't escape.

01:22:45.619 --> 01:22:48.746
And you won't be able to free him.

01:22:48.747 --> 01:22:50.832
Maybe so, but I have to try.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:55.503
But if you give that to me,
I'll be sure you're both released.

01:22:55.504 --> 01:22:57.463
Don't, Sai Yuk.

01:22:57.464 --> 01:22:59.007
He's lying.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:00.883
His promises are empty!

01:23:04.096 --> 01:23:06.389
That's very smart of you.

01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:11.644
Maybe you and I will
one day become good friends.

01:23:11.645 --> 01:23:13.104
Very rich.

01:23:13.105 --> 01:23:14.856
Just forget it.

01:23:14.857 --> 01:23:16.649
You don't fool us.

01:23:16.650 --> 01:23:19.652
My father and these people
will never give up.

01:23:19.653 --> 01:23:21.487
This isn't about money.

01:23:21.655 --> 01:23:24.240
It's about freedom for China.

01:23:28.078 --> 01:23:33.458
You're brave, and your words
are powerful, so I'll be generous.

01:23:33.459 --> 01:23:35.960
We'll see if your courage is real.

01:23:35.961 --> 01:23:38.796
Now, pay careful attention.

01:23:40.341 --> 01:23:42.759
You're going to have to win this time.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:47.513
You'll have to defeat me
before this fire burns through the rope.

01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:50.683
If I win, you must
give me your names.

01:24:41.527 --> 01:24:42.485
Come on!

01:24:55.999 --> 01:24:58.209
Can't you do better?

01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.502
I hope you're trying.

01:25:01.171 --> 01:25:04.799
Very good, but not good enough.

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:21.774
You better get ready.

01:27:42.374 --> 01:27:43.666
Take it!

01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:09.692
Sai Yuk.

01:28:09.693 --> 01:28:11.611
Let it go now.

01:28:11.612 --> 01:28:12.987
No way!

01:28:12.988 --> 01:28:14.238
I'm going to save you.

01:28:14.239 --> 01:28:15.531
Let go.

01:28:15.532 --> 01:28:18.659
I'm proud that you're so grown up.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:19.785
Now go on.

01:28:19.953 --> 01:28:22.580
Your mother and Ting Ting need you.

01:28:22.581 --> 01:28:27.043
I'm proud today to die
for my people and China.

01:28:28.462 --> 01:28:30.046
No!

01:28:30.047 --> 01:28:32.548
I'm not going to let you die.

01:28:38.096 --> 01:28:40.473
Sai Yuk, it's too late.

01:28:40.474 --> 01:28:42.224
Then we'll both die.

01:28:46.813 --> 01:28:49.607
Fong Sai Yuk, we'll help you!

01:28:49.608 --> 01:28:50.566
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:28:56.448 --> 01:28:57.907
Get back!

01:28:57.908 --> 01:29:00.117
Don't move!

01:29:00.118 --> 01:29:02.578
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:29:02.579 --> 01:29:03.663
Get the rope!

01:29:03.664 --> 01:29:05.581
Everyone, everyone! Grab it!

01:29:19.346 --> 01:29:21.347
Here are your names.

01:29:21.348 --> 01:29:24.266
Fools, stop them!

01:29:29.481 --> 01:29:31.691
Don't worry. I'm here.

01:29:34.945 --> 01:29:36.445
Come on! Come on!

01:29:49.334 --> 01:29:51.335
Sai Yuk, you're a bad liar.

01:29:51.336 --> 01:29:53.170
You should know I'd want to help.

01:29:54.381 --> 01:29:55.840
Macu, why'd you tell my mother?

01:29:55.841 --> 01:29:56.924
But I didn't, Master.

01:29:56.925 --> 01:29:58.050
She figured it out herself.

01:29:58.051 --> 01:29:59.844
Are you sure?

01:29:59.845 --> 01:30:02.304
She said it was your eyes
that betrayed you.

01:30:02.305 --> 01:30:03.806
- Go help her.
- Okay.

01:30:03.807 --> 01:30:05.141
Right!

01:30:08.478 --> 01:30:11.313
You make me very angry.

01:30:16.194 --> 01:30:17.153
What's happening?

01:30:44.473 --> 01:30:46.098
Husband, are you okay?

01:30:46.099 --> 01:30:47.183
Yeah. Come on.

01:30:49.686 --> 01:30:51.812
Mom, they're trying to kill Dad.

01:30:57.402 --> 01:30:58.819
Stay close.

01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:15.961
Even you won't be able
to help him...

01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:17.213
now.

01:31:18.924 --> 01:31:23.177
We're both going to die together.

01:31:29.142 --> 01:31:30.893
My shoe can help.

01:31:42.948 --> 01:31:45.324
Mom.

01:31:58.046 --> 01:32:00.798
Sai Yuk, you're a brave fighter.

01:32:00.799 --> 01:32:03.259
Let me teach you to be
a kung fu master.

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.094
- Come with me.
- Father?

01:32:05.095 --> 01:32:07.596
You bring great honor
to our family, Master Chan.

01:32:09.099 --> 01:32:11.642
So, now we'll say good-bye to you.

01:32:11.643 --> 01:32:13.018
Please, sir.

01:32:13.019 --> 01:32:14.019
Can my wife come with us?

01:32:14.187 --> 01:32:16.272
Yes.

01:32:16.273 --> 01:32:18.732
I'm sure Master Chan
will make sure they behave.

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:20.401
What's the matter?

01:32:20.402 --> 01:32:22.820
I'm not ready to be
a grandmother just yet.

01:32:22.821 --> 01:32:24.697
Ting Ting, are you ready?

01:32:26.616 --> 01:32:28.492
I'll miss you.

01:32:28.493 --> 01:32:31.245
Son-in-law, you better treat her right,

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:32.997
or I'll come find you.

01:32:32.998 --> 01:32:35.124
I'm virtuous,
so you won't need to worry.

01:32:35.125 --> 01:32:36.959
Are you making a joke?

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.210
You have to respect me now.

01:32:38.211 --> 01:32:40.379
Yes, Dad.

01:32:42.007 --> 01:32:43.883
Just once, would you smile for me, Dad?

01:32:43.884 --> 01:32:45.342
You wish.

01:32:45.343 --> 01:32:47.678
You're not being fair.

01:32:47.679 --> 01:32:49.263
- Just once?
- Maybe.

01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:50.639
But not now.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.057
It's getting late. We'd better leave.

01:32:52.225 --> 01:32:54.685
Sai Yuk, let's go.

01:32:54.686 --> 01:32:57.104
Bye. I'll be okay.

01:32:57.105 --> 01:32:58.230
We'll write.

01:32:59.733 --> 01:33:01.150
Sai Yuk, behave.

01:33:01.151 --> 01:33:04.236
And remember to stay out of trouble.

01:33:04.237 --> 01:33:05.863
Do you hear me?

01:33:05.864 --> 01:33:07.239
Relax, Mom!

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.949
I'm a married man now!

01:33:12.078 --> 01:33:16.707
Sai Yuk, your father's laughing!

01:33:20.921 --> 01:33:22.713
Hey, there!

01:33:22.714 --> 01:33:24.965
I've got your list right here.
