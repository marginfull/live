00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.300
[Mother] The seed falls
and with time,

00:02:12.384 --> 00:02:15.387
is carried far from
the tree that bore it.

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:19.057
Yet the seed longs
to return...

00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:22.310
for the tree...

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:24.146
is filled with memories.

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:26.148
- Ma!
- Fong, save yourself!

00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:27.941
No way! You need
my protection!

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:36.283
[Mother]
Memories that are joyful

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:39.327
and memories
that are filled with pain.

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.455
Ooh, ow. It hurts.

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:43.874
It would have been worse
if I hadn't shielded you.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:45.292
Please, Dad, no!

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:50.589
I'm coming home! Yeah!

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:55.802
- Aah! Look out!
- Hey, you look great!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.721
Aah!

00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:02.059
[Mother]
He longs to return...

00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:04.603
no matter
how great the distance...

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:06.438
or how barren
the terrain...

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:10.442
because the memory is so strong
and lasting and clear.

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:16.656
Its images are glimpsed
through time's pallid veil...

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.284
like an apparition.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:20.911
Come on, come on!

00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:23.455
Coming unbidden,
a shadow--

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:25.791
Wait a minute. Unh!

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.711
A shadow,
a whispering wind,

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:31.088
calling his name.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.589
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.885
Ha ha! Hyah!

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:41.431
[Horse Neighs]

00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:44.142
[Parade Music]

00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:01.034
[Chan] Our people have
been looking forward

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:02.494
to this celebration.

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:05.539
Ha ha ha! Yes, good.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:08.917
[Cheering]

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:12.129
It pleases me to see them
enjoying themselves.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.297
Ahh. Sai Yuk.

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:16.925
Do you know how lucky
we both are?

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:18.468
This is the way
it should be.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.846
[Waiter] Go away!
We don't allow begging here!

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.431
- No! Go away!
- Sir, it's for the poor.

00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:26.143
- Don't you understand--
- I told you there's no begging here.

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.102
Now go away.

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:27.978
Hey! Can't you--

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.479
Hey, he's with me.

00:04:30.397 --> 00:04:32.315
- Bless you, my son.
- Sorry. I didn't know.

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:37.112
Aie!

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.905
Only a minute ago
you threw him out.

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:40.490
- Shall we?
- Fine.

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:43.994
Ow. My knees.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:51.459
What hit me?

00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:01.261
Reverend, there's plenty
to eat, so go on.

00:05:01.553 --> 00:05:03.221
Ah, bless you.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.932
Allow me the great honour

00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:08.143
of reading
your fortune tonight.

00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:12.439
I foresee that you will lead
an extraordinary life.

00:05:12.522 --> 00:05:14.065
- Me?
- That's nothing.

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:16.693
He already has
an extraordinary wife.

00:05:18.028 --> 00:05:19.654
Yes, I'm sure.

00:05:19.738 --> 00:05:21.573
You will bring him
happiness.

00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:24.910
I foresee that you
will have one boy child

00:05:24.993 --> 00:05:26.119
and one girl.

00:05:26.328 --> 00:05:28.330
- Isn't that wonderful?
- No more?

00:05:28.538 --> 00:05:33.501
I predict a minimum
of two girls and two boys

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:34.669
for you, sir.

00:05:34.753 --> 00:05:36.004
That's great!

00:05:38.924 --> 00:05:41.718
Wait, sir, do you mean
that I'll--

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:43.053
Yes, you comprehend.

00:05:43.136 --> 00:05:45.222
- But, uh...
- Mmm!

00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:48.016
Wait! Ting Ting!

00:05:48.308 --> 00:05:49.935
Reverend, help yourself.
I've got to go.

00:05:50.227 --> 00:05:51.144
Ting Ting! Wait!

00:05:51.228 --> 00:05:53.063
Wait! I'm not finished!

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:54.522
Don't go away!

00:05:55.148 --> 00:05:58.610
I'm afraid my godson
is always in such a big hurry.

00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:01.571
Sir, you beware.

00:06:02.072 --> 00:06:04.741
Your face is clouded
with evil.

00:06:06.493 --> 00:06:07.494
You're mistaken.

00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:10.080
No. It seems clear to me.

00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:11.623
Your palm.

00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:14.751
[Chuckles]
All right. Go on.

00:06:17.587 --> 00:06:18.672
Emperor!

00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:23.635
Good sir, why are you
calling me emperor?

00:06:23.927 --> 00:06:25.470
Because I saw it.

00:06:26.096 --> 00:06:28.890
The markings on
your hand are those

00:06:28.974 --> 00:06:31.851
that only one of
the royal line would have.

00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:37.983
[Woman] My son, it is no longer
safe for you here.

00:06:38.775 --> 00:06:39.818
You will go to Japan

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:41.695
to live under
the protection of Mr. Yun,

00:06:41.903 --> 00:06:44.030
leader of
the Red Flower Society.

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:46.700
Your new name
will be Chan Ka Lok.

00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:48.910
Inside of this sacred box

00:06:48.994 --> 00:06:51.830
are documents which prove
your true birthright.

00:06:52.122 --> 00:06:53.748
One day, when it is safe,

00:06:53.832 --> 00:06:56.418
I hope that you will be able
to return to the throne.

00:06:56.668 --> 00:06:59.462
[Shouting]

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:15.937
Ahem.

00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:20.483
Yes.
You should be cautious

00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:21.651
about what
you tell people.

00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:23.236
I'm telling you
what I saw.

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:24.654
Nothing more.

00:07:26.114 --> 00:07:28.908
I'm...I'm sensing a man

00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:31.202
who is close to you
will betray you...

00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:35.248
yet another person close
will be there to protect you.

00:07:35.707 --> 00:07:37.000
Perhaps save your life.

00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:42.297
Sai Yuk, when do
we get to be alone?

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.923
I thought
we were married.

00:07:44.007 --> 00:07:45.467
Doesn't seem
that way now.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.470
Don't be silly.
I love you.

00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:52.474
Oh. Then maybe you can
show your feelings.

00:07:53.016 --> 00:07:54.851
[Whispering]

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.355
Wait, you mean make
an ass of myself?

00:07:58.646 --> 00:07:59.773
They'd laugh
at me.

00:08:00.148 --> 00:08:01.399
They might laugh...

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:03.234
but I need to
hear it from you

00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:04.152
once in awhile.

00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:05.612
Hmm. All right then.

00:08:07.072 --> 00:08:10.575
If it's a problem,
well, I'm sorry.

00:08:11.326 --> 00:08:12.369
Lay down here with me.

00:08:13.828 --> 00:08:15.455
All right, then.

00:08:15.914 --> 00:08:18.666
Good. But don't
make it sound wrong.

00:08:19.084 --> 00:08:21.086
Hmm. All right.

00:08:23.213 --> 00:08:24.923
I love you. Good?

00:08:25.423 --> 00:08:26.424
Let's try it again.

00:08:26.883 --> 00:08:27.967
Can you say it?

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:30.845
- All right. I love you.
- Oh.

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:34.933
What?
Beat it right now.

00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:37.018
What he said
was pretty nice.

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:39.479
I'd like to have
such a good boy.

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:40.688
You're crazy!

00:08:41.106 --> 00:08:42.524
Hey, how about it?

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:44.776
Sai Yuk, did you
hear what he said?

00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:45.985
Knock him out!

00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:47.112
But why?

00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:49.531
Because of what he said.
Let's beat him up right now.

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:52.492
- Mmm!
- Don't try it.

00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:54.285
I'll do it!

00:08:54.369 --> 00:08:55.245
Think so?

00:08:55.537 --> 00:08:57.288
Hey, stop it now!
Come on!

00:08:57.539 --> 00:09:00.083
[Both] Hey!
Your dad's calling you!

00:09:00.792 --> 00:09:02.419
See that?
Your father wants you.

00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:03.503
Go on.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:05.964
There.

00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:07.382
I'll come back again.
You'll see.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.591
See you then.

00:09:08.842 --> 00:09:11.553
- Let's go.
- [Shouting]

00:09:14.973 --> 00:09:15.974
Go!

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:19.686
They're good.

00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:27.986
[Clapping]

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:46.671
[Chan]
Watch out! Reverend!

00:09:50.008 --> 00:09:53.511
Aah!

00:09:55.722 --> 00:09:56.723
Someone, please!

00:10:00.143 --> 00:10:01.394
What happened?
I'll go see!

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.734
[Yelling]

00:10:54.072 --> 00:10:55.740
All right.
Shall we do it?

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:57.242
[Yelling]

00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:03.016
I'm just waiting.

00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:06.436
Aah!

00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:29.751
Hold it!

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.337
It could be a trap!

00:12:32.754 --> 00:12:33.921
Save your strength.

00:12:34.339 --> 00:12:36.424
[Man] The meeting of
the Red Flower Society

00:12:36.507 --> 00:12:37.842
will come to order.

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.093
Congratulations.

00:12:39.177 --> 00:12:40.928
You men and women
have done well.

00:12:41.804 --> 00:12:43.765
Now let's hear from
some of our members.

00:12:43.848 --> 00:12:45.141
Who has a report?

00:12:46.476 --> 00:12:47.894
[Man] Mr. Chan, sir!

00:12:47.977 --> 00:12:49.312
Our new fishing rights
agreement

00:12:49.395 --> 00:12:51.606
will take effect
at the start of the month.

00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:53.441
[Clapping]

00:12:53.524 --> 00:12:55.151
[Man 2] The brood mares
have given birth

00:12:55.234 --> 00:12:56.778
to three more colts!

00:12:56.986 --> 00:12:59.989
Ahh, it seems like
it's all good news, right?

00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:02.700
The society is doing
tremendously right now.

00:13:03.785 --> 00:13:06.037
The value of our property
in Shanghai

00:13:06.537 --> 00:13:08.539
has increased three times!

00:13:08.623 --> 00:13:10.708
[Clapping]

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:13.211
[Man] Sir,
all the good news

00:13:13.294 --> 00:13:14.504
calls for
a celebration!

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.673
[Chan] I'm afraid not.

00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:19.217
Some of our neighbours
have been victims

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.593
of the recent flooding.

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:22.220
We will loan them
some money.

00:13:23.012 --> 00:13:24.931
Wow. I could do
all that, right?

00:13:25.807 --> 00:13:28.142
No, you couldn't.
It'd be too much for you.

00:13:28.226 --> 00:13:30.895
What? Come on.
I'm up to it.

00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:34.649
Mr. Chan, will you honour us
by naming our baby?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.401
Yes, of course.

00:13:36.484 --> 00:13:37.610
Thank you, sir.

00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:41.531
He's a handsome boy.

00:13:41.781 --> 00:13:44.200
Why don't we name him
Sung Taian?

00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:47.704
I hope that he will give you
a lot of pleasure.

00:14:00.383 --> 00:14:01.426
Unh!

00:14:02.343 --> 00:14:03.469
Don't kill her!

00:14:07.849 --> 00:14:09.392
She tried
to kill you, sir.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.893
I had to do it.

00:14:11.644 --> 00:14:12.895
Why would Mrs. Leong--

00:14:14.772 --> 00:14:16.899
Look...
it's someone in a mask.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.359
Who could this be?

00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:20.987
Say, that woman
was with you.

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:22.655
What happened
to Mrs. Leong?

00:14:23.364 --> 00:14:25.366
Hey, what are you
babbling about?

00:14:25.783 --> 00:14:28.202
Why don't we ask him some
questions about the woman?

00:14:29.454 --> 00:14:31.581
Sure. Who's behind it?

00:14:31.956 --> 00:14:34.459
He's jealous because his father
didn't appoint him to lead us!

00:14:34.542 --> 00:14:36.002
Aren't you, Mr. Yun?

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.629
And so you've become obsessed
with murdering our leader!

00:14:38.713 --> 00:14:40.965
- That's a complete lie!
- Prove it! You're a traitor, too!

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:43.509
- [Crying]
- Stop that!

00:14:44.093 --> 00:14:47.054
How can we expect to overthrow
the Manchus when we fight each other?

00:14:47.138 --> 00:14:48.431
We must stand united!

00:14:48.931 --> 00:14:49.974
He can forget it.

00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:52.685
Well, what happens if
we don't come together?

00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:54.812
What? What difference
would it make?

00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:57.607
The only good philosophy
would be to stay neutral.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.067
Oh, stay out of trouble,
is that what you're saying?

00:15:00.151 --> 00:15:03.821
Exactly.
You said it. You said it.

00:15:03.905 --> 00:15:06.199
For those of you
who question my loyalty

00:15:06.282 --> 00:15:08.075
to the Red Flower Society,

00:15:08.701 --> 00:15:10.244
I will prove myself.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.706
Hey...

00:15:17.877 --> 00:15:19.378
So I see
you were fighting.

00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:22.298
Your father
was a loyal subject,

00:15:22.507 --> 00:15:26.886
and his son could not be
any less honourable.

00:15:28.429 --> 00:15:31.682
I promise that I will
search out this traitor scum

00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:33.309
and I will kill him!

00:15:33.643 --> 00:15:36.020
Father, what happened
with her now?

00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:38.397
- My son, go away.
- Hold on!

00:15:41.359 --> 00:15:43.820
Son, you've seen
this woman?

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.739
Yes, sir. Dad was
talking with her

00:15:46.823 --> 00:15:48.574
before the meeting
started.

00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:52.829
Well,
there you have it.

00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:54.288
You shut your face!

00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:02.255
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:04.882
- He's your own son!
- Who are you?

00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:06.467
Who am I?

00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:09.428
Aw, are you saying
that you don't know me?

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:12.098
Well, I am our leader's
favourite relative...

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:14.225
known as Fong Sai Yuk!

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:16.143
Do you know who I am?

00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:18.312
Oh, yeah.
The boy beater.

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:19.564
Unh!

00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:20.648
Down!

00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:22.900
What are you doing?

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.902
Do you know who
Mr. Yun's father is?

00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:26.279
He's our former leader!

00:16:26.362 --> 00:16:28.030
Sir. But the little boy was--

00:16:28.114 --> 00:16:29.907
That will be enough!
Mr. Dong!

00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:31.659
Uh, why are you looking
at me like that?

00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:33.870
Give Fong Sai Yuk
some of your knowledge.

00:16:33.953 --> 00:16:35.079
Teach him
our commandments.

00:16:35.413 --> 00:16:36.998
- With pleasure!
- Good.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.624
See that he learns well.

00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:47.091
[Dong] The commandments of
the Red Flower Society.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.095
One. You will not steal
another person's property.

00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:53.806
Two. You will not covet
the property of another.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.351
Three. You will not covet
the wife of another man.

00:16:57.435 --> 00:16:59.312
Four. You will
always be truthful.

00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:02.315
Five. Honour our leader
in every way.

00:17:02.857 --> 00:17:05.067
Hey, are you getting it?
I'll start again.

00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:08.487
It's more like
the seven Taoist commands.

00:17:08.571 --> 00:17:10.489
Yeah, that's just
where he got it from,

00:17:10.573 --> 00:17:12.617
and Mr. Yun has
adapted it for us.

00:17:12.992 --> 00:17:14.285
Huh. I thought so.

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:17.246
[Yun] I see
you're a slow learner.

00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:22.043
Today you insulted me...

00:17:22.335 --> 00:17:24.128
and I'm not
about to forget it.

00:17:24.837 --> 00:17:27.632
It's time you learned
a more important lesson

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:30.092
from one
who is your superior.

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:33.179
Who? The one who
hits boys?

00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.097
I'd like to
see you handle

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:37.767
someone
that hits back.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.478
How should
we settle this?

00:17:41.187 --> 00:17:44.106
Maybe your godfather
could come to your rescue.

00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:46.359
No! The book
of commandments

00:17:46.442 --> 00:17:49.612
says to settle this
a different way.

00:17:50.738 --> 00:17:51.906
Fighting.

00:17:53.574 --> 00:17:55.201
Are you ready to fight?

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:56.410
Uh-oh.

00:18:33.823 --> 00:18:35.116
[Yun growls]

00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:15.489
[Yun growls]

00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:26.876
Enough!

00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:28.794
Fighting is not
for settling disputes

00:19:28.878 --> 00:19:30.254
within the society.

00:19:31.088 --> 00:19:32.339
We are a family!

00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:34.550
You should save it
for the Manchus!

00:19:34.633 --> 00:19:35.509
I'm sorry.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.804
When someone insults
the Yun name...

00:19:42.016 --> 00:19:43.017
I will fight.

00:19:43.434 --> 00:19:45.770
Be prepared
to do it again.

00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:52.276
The commandments
that you learned,

00:19:52.777 --> 00:19:54.028
did you understand them?

00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:55.279
Uncle, it wasn't me!

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:56.822
That's enough!
Kneel!

00:19:58.491 --> 00:20:01.035
- Your reason?
- The boy! His own child!

00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:02.620
No one should hurt
a baby like that.

00:20:02.828 --> 00:20:04.997
You are sure
in your convictions.

00:20:05.331 --> 00:20:06.749
It's your actions

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:08.751
I'm concerned with
right now.

00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:11.462
But am I supposed
to just ignore it?

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.465
Perhaps... yes.

00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:17.009
When it's necessary.

00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:19.261
You think too much
like your mother.

00:20:19.512 --> 00:20:21.180
Maybe you should
go home to her.

00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:25.810
So keep reading.

00:20:26.102 --> 00:20:27.603
I know he wants you
to learn it.

00:20:27.937 --> 00:20:29.688
Anyway,
this part's the hardest.

00:20:29.939 --> 00:20:31.023
Here.

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:45.955
You know what?
He didn't have to do that.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.208
Maybe we ought to go and
visit with your mother.

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:50.709
What?

00:20:51.377 --> 00:20:53.879
Well, why wouldn't we?

00:20:55.131 --> 00:20:56.799
I'll tell you all
one thing--

00:20:57.091 --> 00:20:58.300
one of these days...

00:20:59.301 --> 00:21:01.303
I'll do it. Really.

00:21:01.846 --> 00:21:04.723
I'll be... the leader!

00:21:07.143 --> 00:21:08.936
Hey, come on!
Come on!

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.062
Yeah.

00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:13.482
Soup. Soup always
has to be made

00:21:13.566 --> 00:21:15.401
with only
the best vegetables.

00:21:15.484 --> 00:21:17.153
Madam, someone's here
to see you.

00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:24.660
What's this,
a birthday party?

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:26.412
Tell me, where's Sai Yuk?

00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:27.580
Why?

00:21:27.788 --> 00:21:30.291
From the Yangtze
to the Kowloon Harbour,

00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:31.959
I've fought them all

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:33.836
and they call me
the Duke of Hell!

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.254
Duke of Hell?

00:21:35.671 --> 00:21:37.965
I'll show you some hell.
Pbblt!

00:21:42.678 --> 00:21:43.846
Fong Sai Yuk's mother.

00:21:44.513 --> 00:21:46.098
Now, get the hell
out of my sight.

00:21:46.307 --> 00:21:47.474
Where's she going?

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:49.351
Hey, stop her.

00:21:49.435 --> 00:21:51.145
There's just one more thing
I've got to say.

00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:53.689
- Yeah?
- Watch this. Bite me!

00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:57.193
[Yelling]

00:22:01.614 --> 00:22:02.990
Well, how'd you
like that one?

00:22:03.574 --> 00:22:06.243
Madam Fong,
that was a real good one.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.620
Oh, my soup.

00:22:08.204 --> 00:22:09.205
Oh, my.

00:22:09.747 --> 00:22:11.540
Is that for
Master Fong Sai Yuk?

00:22:11.874 --> 00:22:13.959
You bet it is.
See you later.

00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:18.130
I miss my master so!

00:22:18.714 --> 00:22:20.466
Sai Yuk!

00:22:45.658 --> 00:22:48.953
My good sir, I wonder if
you might be able to help me.

00:22:49.328 --> 00:22:50.663
I'm all out of water.

00:22:51.664 --> 00:22:52.706
Ahh.

00:22:57.753 --> 00:22:59.421
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:23:07.263 --> 00:23:08.889
"On the first of the month,

00:23:08.973 --> 00:23:12.142
a band of Japanese samurai
will travel nearby.

00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:15.562
They will have
the sacred box

00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:17.189
in which your secret
is hidden."

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:21.443
Mr. Lin!

00:23:21.694 --> 00:23:22.778
Yes, sir!

00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:24.113
[Chan] Mr. Wong!

00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:25.531
Here, sir!

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.790
[Dong] I hope he doesn't
want me to go.

00:23:36.542 --> 00:23:39.837
- Mr. Dong.
- I don't think I'm ready yet.

00:23:40.087 --> 00:23:42.214
Take someone on the mission
who is more prepared.

00:23:42.298 --> 00:23:43.299
Calm down.

00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:46.468
Better to name a good fighter
to go on this mission.

00:23:46.969 --> 00:23:48.178
That won't be you.

00:23:48.679 --> 00:23:50.139
Who would be
your choice?

00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:53.600
Ha ha!
I say we take Sai Yuk

00:23:53.684 --> 00:23:55.144
because he's always ready.

00:23:55.853 --> 00:23:57.771
That's what I think anyway.

00:23:58.564 --> 00:23:59.481
Fong Sai Yuk!

00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:00.816
Yo! Yes, sir!

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.192
[Dong] Go, Sai Yuk!

00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:07.156
The mission is yours.
Do you accept it?

00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:08.490
I do!

00:24:08.574 --> 00:24:10.367
Some of you
may not come back.

00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:14.079
[All] Huh! All of us
are prepared to die!

00:24:14.538 --> 00:24:16.332
[Chan] Bring back
the sacred box!

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.923
The numbers four and nine.

00:24:25.215 --> 00:24:28.135
Four and nine?
[Laughs]

00:24:28.218 --> 00:24:30.929
[Laughing]

00:24:31.138 --> 00:24:32.723
What is so damn funny?

00:24:32.806 --> 00:24:33.932
Well,
they were laughing.

00:24:34.183 --> 00:24:36.185
Because you've got
the loser's hand.

00:24:36.393 --> 00:24:37.978
- In mahjong?
- Roulette.

00:24:38.062 --> 00:24:39.146
I don't play it.

00:24:39.396 --> 00:24:41.273
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Remember now?

00:24:41.482 --> 00:24:43.233
Oh, yeah. Number six,
I shall not steal.

00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:45.652
Besides that.
You shall bring my girlfriend something.

00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:46.987
I won't forget.

00:24:47.488 --> 00:24:48.781
Bye. Good luck.

00:24:49.782 --> 00:24:51.909
Hyah!

00:24:54.453 --> 00:24:55.704
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:24:56.705 --> 00:24:59.375
Hold on. Let's be certain
that you're safe.

00:25:00.084 --> 00:25:02.044
Take this. It's good luck.

00:25:02.336 --> 00:25:03.295
Yeah, you're right.

00:25:03.379 --> 00:25:05.089
We can't just
sit here all day.

00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:06.757
We're on a mission.

00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:09.218
Why are we waiting, then?
Good-bye.

00:25:10.844 --> 00:25:13.138
Stay safe, all right?
Bye-bye!

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.641
Hyah! Hyah!

00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:26.235
Ah, hello!
It's Mama Fong!

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:27.945
Lei Ling!

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:30.697
What brings you
here today?

00:25:30.906 --> 00:25:32.324
Go on. Go on.

00:25:32.699 --> 00:25:34.034
- My stable.
- [Man] Yes, miss.

00:25:34.118 --> 00:25:35.035
So, what's the occasion?

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:36.412
I brought soup
for Sai Yuk.

00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:37.454
He's on a mission!

00:25:37.538 --> 00:25:40.082
Right now? But I made
some soup for him.

00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:43.377
I can't believe you brought
his favourite soup all this way.

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:45.379
Mmm. Looks good.

00:25:57.933 --> 00:25:58.851
What's the matter?

00:25:59.435 --> 00:26:01.019
[Sai Yuk]
Quiet! Hear that?

00:26:26.837 --> 00:26:28.297
[Sai Yuk]
It's the samurai!

00:26:30.215 --> 00:26:31.967
[Man] That woman's
in trouble.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.762
Wait. I've seen
that woman before.

00:26:39.224 --> 00:26:40.684
Hey, there, miss!

00:26:41.935 --> 00:26:43.145
What are you doing?
Get away!

00:26:43.228 --> 00:26:44.438
Hello, Sai.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:45.606
You know me?

00:26:47.357 --> 00:26:48.400
[Man] The sacred box!

00:26:49.693 --> 00:26:51.361
[Yelling]

00:26:58.911 --> 00:27:00.913
[Yelling]

00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:38.367
They used nerve blocking
to paralyse you,

00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:39.618
but I can undo it.

00:27:42.329 --> 00:27:44.790
Hey! I'm still paralysed
from the waist down!

00:27:45.207 --> 00:27:46.375
Oh.

00:27:50.712 --> 00:27:51.838
I'm sorry.

00:27:52.548 --> 00:27:53.882
Go on.

00:27:56.009 --> 00:27:57.302
I'm not sure how.

00:28:03.517 --> 00:28:05.185
I'll carry you.
Come on.

00:28:05.394 --> 00:28:06.395
Oh!

00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:50.731
[Samurai] Get them!

00:28:50.814 --> 00:28:51.815
Go!

00:29:00.532 --> 00:29:02.284
[gasps]

00:29:12.127 --> 00:29:14.254
Yaah!

00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:49.831
[Samurai] I'm going
to paralyse you!

00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:53.085
Get them!

00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.988
Matsuhiro!

00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:23.782
Matsuhiro?

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.118
It's your mother.

00:30:26.618 --> 00:30:28.787
Ma! The box,
right there.

00:30:29.204 --> 00:30:30.414
We need it.

00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:44.511
Yes, sir.

00:31:06.199 --> 00:31:07.242
Still here?

00:31:07.325 --> 00:31:08.535
Still here!

00:31:14.458 --> 00:31:15.917
I'll take that box now.

00:31:27.471 --> 00:31:28.597
All my nerves
are blocked.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.890
Can she do
anything?

00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:32.893
Hmm? Oh, no.

00:31:33.518 --> 00:31:34.394
No?

00:31:34.603 --> 00:31:35.812
I wouldn't know how.

00:31:35.896 --> 00:31:37.022
Oh, come on.

00:31:43.487 --> 00:31:44.613
Hey, he'll do.

00:31:44.988 --> 00:31:47.157
[Buzzing]

00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:51.036
Ai!

00:31:52.162 --> 00:31:55.081
Now, try to get it
into a good position.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.126
Look out. Now blow it
at me hard.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.966
I keep missing.
You do it.

00:32:07.344 --> 00:32:11.056
Your technique needs work.
It's too high.

00:32:13.558 --> 00:32:14.851
[Gulp]

00:32:16.686 --> 00:32:17.646
It's so--

00:32:19.397 --> 00:32:20.273
I missed, huh?

00:32:21.358 --> 00:32:22.984
Sorry. Is it bad?

00:32:23.193 --> 00:32:27.364
Ugh. Tastes like
you'd expect it to taste.

00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:30.742
Hey, watch. It's going
to get interesting.

00:32:31.618 --> 00:32:33.036
Ohh!

00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:46.675
That did it. Let's go.

00:32:49.928 --> 00:32:50.887
- What are you looking at?
- Me?

00:32:50.971 --> 00:32:52.138
Yeah, you.

00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:54.099
Wait. There's something
you can show me.

00:32:54.182 --> 00:32:56.101
All right, I'd be happy to.
What is it?

00:32:56.601 --> 00:32:58.812
Well, how do you
unparalyse the legs?

00:32:59.145 --> 00:33:00.647
Just hit him
in the stomach.

00:33:01.648 --> 00:33:02.774
Oh.

00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:23.461
[Yun] That Fong Sai Yuck!

00:33:28.842 --> 00:33:30.093
It's Fong Sai Yuk.

00:33:31.219 --> 00:33:33.763
Listen, son,
let me do the talking. Me.

00:33:33.847 --> 00:33:35.015
But, Mum, you can't.

00:33:36.224 --> 00:33:37.100
There he goes!

00:33:37.183 --> 00:33:38.727
Following his mother
around again!

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.645
[Laughter]

00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:44.774
I know.
Always her little dog.

00:33:45.358 --> 00:33:46.776
He follows her.

00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:50.530
If you have something to say,
then say it out loud,

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.032
or keep your mouth shut.

00:33:52.407 --> 00:33:54.117
Look at you all
sitting here,

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.912
stuffing your faces while
my son is out risking his neck

00:33:56.995 --> 00:33:58.580
for the Red Flower Society.

00:33:58.663 --> 00:34:01.875
If any of you had an ounce of bravery,
instead of sitting here,

00:34:01.958 --> 00:34:04.002
you'd be out doing
something about it.

00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:06.171
But all I see
are six or seven men

00:34:06.254 --> 00:34:08.757
who, I must say, haven't
shown me a damn thing!

00:34:08.965 --> 00:34:10.216
Shut up!

00:34:10.592 --> 00:34:11.801
On this mission,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.472
why was it only your son
who returned unharmed?

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.641
What of it?

00:34:19.768 --> 00:34:21.478
Does your mother
fight your battles?

00:34:23.063 --> 00:34:24.272
So!

00:34:26.608 --> 00:34:27.609
Simple...

00:34:27.692 --> 00:34:29.361
he fights better
than most of them.

00:34:30.278 --> 00:34:31.196
Understand?

00:34:36.326 --> 00:34:38.119
You want me?
Let's do it, then.

00:34:38.495 --> 00:34:40.372
Only remember
who started it.

00:34:40.705 --> 00:34:42.624
You don't have to fight
this fool for me.

00:34:42.707 --> 00:34:44.209
For once shut your mouth!

00:34:45.168 --> 00:34:46.002
I'm sick of it!

00:34:46.086 --> 00:34:48.964
Mr. Yun...
I'll take care of it.

00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:50.966
- Uh-huh.
- Mr. Chan,

00:34:51.049 --> 00:34:52.801
if I might possibly have
a word with you?

00:34:52.884 --> 00:34:54.302
I'm Mrs. Fong.

00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:56.096
Yes. You're
Sai Yuk's mum.

00:34:57.222 --> 00:34:59.557
That's it?
The boy's mum?

00:34:59.933 --> 00:35:03.144
Mr. Chan, all of Han Mei
knows my reputation.

00:35:03.228 --> 00:35:04.688
Don't tell me
you don't know me.

00:35:04.771 --> 00:35:06.356
About all the fights
that I've won?

00:35:06.648 --> 00:35:07.941
Please tell me
you know me.

00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:10.694
You must be joking.
Can't be.

00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:12.404
Son, let's get out
of this house.

00:35:12.487 --> 00:35:14.114
I'm being toyed with.
Good day.

00:35:14.197 --> 00:35:15.824
We have a duty
to the Red Flower.

00:35:16.032 --> 00:35:17.575
Stay here then.
I'll go.

00:35:18.284 --> 00:35:19.285
Hmm?

00:35:21.204 --> 00:35:22.998
I think I've changed
my mind.

00:35:23.248 --> 00:35:25.125
If you happen to be
looking for me,

00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:26.209
I'll be here.

00:35:26.292 --> 00:35:28.253
[Thunder rumbling]

00:35:42.267 --> 00:35:44.853
It's pouring.
You shouldn't be out.

00:35:44.936 --> 00:35:46.229
I have come to visit.

00:35:48.064 --> 00:35:49.274
Ohh!

00:35:49.941 --> 00:35:51.109
Aah!

[Groaning]

00:35:52.527 --> 00:35:55.280
I've brought some presents.
A few trinkets...

00:35:55.363 --> 00:35:58.199
and some Japanese sakémoto.

00:35:58.491 --> 00:36:00.744
Stronger than wine.
Let me help.

00:36:00.827 --> 00:36:03.038
No, wait, no, wait. I'm not sure
I'm up to it.

00:36:03.455 --> 00:36:04.998
I haven't seen this before.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.250
Oh, well,
guess it's all mine.

00:36:07.542 --> 00:36:09.961
But it's immoral!
Listen to what I'm saying!

drink that in here!

What will people say?

Please!
I'm begging--Aah!

00:36:17.385 --> 00:36:18.553
That's right.

00:36:19.512 --> 00:36:21.848
You'd better help me...

00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:24.225
or I might get drunk.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.644
But it's sakémoto!

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.396
We'll both end up drunk

00:36:28.646 --> 00:36:30.482
and you don't want--
Ohh!

Don't tell me
you're shy.

00:36:45.705 --> 00:36:47.332
You're afraid
it will...

00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:51.336
go too far?

[Giggles]

00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:58.468
What have I done
to deserve this?!

I'd seen the last of her

so many years ago!

00:37:08.645 --> 00:37:11.898

to stop me.

around to see us.

Perhaps if we shared
it once more?

No! Why do you tempt me

00:37:37.132 --> 00:37:39.008

Damn fool!

00:37:44.597 --> 00:37:46.641
There's something
about sake.

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:48.852
The more you drink...

00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:51.312
the more you want.

00:37:53.022 --> 00:37:55.900
All right, then. You have
to do something for me.

00:37:55.984 --> 00:37:57.152
- Huh?
- You...

00:37:57.235 --> 00:37:59.404
Just a minute now.

00:37:59.487 --> 00:38:03.116
I'm not interested
in prostituting myself.

00:38:03.324 --> 00:38:05.368
I'm sure I'll survive
without that.

00:38:05.577 --> 00:38:08.580
Listen, I want you to teach me
the fatal nerve block.

00:38:08.788 --> 00:38:11.457
Shh.

00:38:11.541 --> 00:38:13.543
Shh. Shh.

00:38:13.918 --> 00:38:15.837
But that's
a secret move.

00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:17.881
It won't be
imparted now.

00:38:17.964 --> 00:38:19.215
Maybe you should
hear me out.

00:38:19.716 --> 00:38:21.676
Fong Sai Yuk is the one
who needs to learn it.

00:38:21.759 --> 00:38:23.511
I want you
to show it to him.

00:38:24.804 --> 00:38:26.806
What for?
I mean, why?

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.016
Why do you think?

00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:29.642
So the rest of them
who know it

00:38:29.934 --> 00:38:32.896
won't be able to take advantage
of him so much anymore.

00:38:33.563 --> 00:38:34.564
[Snoring]

00:38:34.647 --> 00:38:35.648
Ooh!

00:38:36.482 --> 00:38:38.943
[Rooster Crows]

00:38:39.569 --> 00:38:42.155
[Grunting]

00:38:49.996 --> 00:38:51.206
Hey!

00:38:51.873 --> 00:38:53.041
Keep quiet about it.

00:38:53.249 --> 00:38:54.459
Oh, shut up.

00:38:55.543 --> 00:38:57.712
Ever try good manners?

00:38:58.379 --> 00:38:59.422
Old bat.

00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:07.555
Good morning.

00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:09.641
Lei Ling. Did you
sleep all right?

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:11.851
What are you
wearing?

00:39:13.645 --> 00:39:15.021
I was
practising.

00:39:18.399 --> 00:39:19.776
Hey, I have a question.

00:39:20.151 --> 00:39:24.364
If a married woman
were to, um, to...

00:39:24.614 --> 00:39:26.074
s-sleep with someone,

00:39:26.157 --> 00:39:28.451
a person to whom
she wasn't married,

00:39:28.534 --> 00:39:31.412
but the two of them
were doing it,

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:34.374
doing it,
well, you know.

00:39:34.582 --> 00:39:35.875
You know what
they were doing.

00:39:36.334 --> 00:39:37.794
Do you think
there's anything wrong?

00:39:38.294 --> 00:39:41.047
Mum, what?
Something so low?

00:39:42.715 --> 00:39:45.843
There's not even a good word
for what she's doing.

00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:49.222
I mean, I just think
sleeping around like that

00:39:49.305 --> 00:39:50.598
can't be forgiven.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.475
I mean,
what kind of woman

00:39:52.558 --> 00:39:54.477
would carry on
like that?

00:39:54.727 --> 00:39:56.271
You know very well
that it's wrong.

00:39:56.521 --> 00:39:58.231
Now, what kind of woman
could this person be,

00:39:58.314 --> 00:40:00.525
sleeping with a man
she isn't married to?

00:40:00.775 --> 00:40:02.110
What was she thinking?

00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:04.529
The whole town should--
they should just destroy

00:40:04.612 --> 00:40:05.905
this little whore
as an example

00:40:06.155 --> 00:40:07.615
so it won't
happen again.

00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:10.159
So, now that
we've settled that,

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.203
do you want to go
to the market today?

00:40:13.288 --> 00:40:14.289
Lei Ling?

00:40:14.664 --> 00:40:15.832
Lei Ling?

00:40:27.844 --> 00:40:29.012
Hey!

00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:32.140
What are you doing?
I'm all naked!

00:40:32.348 --> 00:40:35.143
You should have kept
your clothes on last night.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.894
This is what you did!

00:40:37.395 --> 00:40:39.230
[Gasps]
She's pregnant!

00:40:41.024 --> 00:40:43.484
Wait!
It's not possible!

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.655
Damn it! Get out
of there right now!

00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:50.825
Let me show you what I do to
guys who take advantage of me

00:40:50.908 --> 00:40:53.202
while I'm sleeping,
you lousy little pig!

00:40:53.286 --> 00:40:55.455
- I oughta cut you a new--
- Hey, put that thing away!

00:40:55.663 --> 00:40:59.000
Not until I'm finished!
I'll make you pay for this!

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.626
Aah!

00:41:03.296 --> 00:41:04.380
Listen, think about it!

00:41:04.672 --> 00:41:05.715
Even if something happened,

00:41:05.798 --> 00:41:08.092
it's not possible for you
to get that big so soon!

00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:09.135
Sure,
that's what you say.

00:41:09.218 --> 00:41:10.928
It's got to be
something else.

00:41:11.012 --> 00:41:12.680
There's no way
something like that

00:41:12.764 --> 00:41:13.973
can happen overnight!

00:41:14.057 --> 00:41:16.267
I've heard the same story
a lot of times before!

00:41:16.476 --> 00:41:18.353
You set me up to have
your way with me!

00:41:18.561 --> 00:41:20.605
No, listen, it's got
to be something else!

00:41:20.688 --> 00:41:21.814
Like what?

00:41:21.898 --> 00:41:24.400
I can tell you what it is
by taking your pulse!

00:41:24.484 --> 00:41:25.777
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:41:26.152 --> 00:41:28.363
Gas!
When you're drunk,

00:41:28.821 --> 00:41:29.989
you get gas!

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.367
Ohh!

00:41:37.705 --> 00:41:39.999
[Mandarin] The samurai
have brought me the box...

00:41:43.044 --> 00:41:45.630
so I want all of you
to guard it well.

00:41:45.713 --> 00:41:46.631
Yes, sir!

00:41:46.714 --> 00:41:49.801
[Humming]

00:41:51.969 --> 00:41:53.137
[laughs]

00:41:53.846 --> 00:41:55.181
Sho Soo Li.

00:41:57.517 --> 00:41:58.935
Sho Soo Li!

00:41:59.185 --> 00:42:00.269
Yes, Father.

00:42:00.937 --> 00:42:02.522
What are you
daydreaming about?

00:42:03.356 --> 00:42:04.315
A boy.

00:42:04.607 --> 00:42:05.817
[Mandarin]
Well, that's enough.

00:42:07.485 --> 00:42:09.445
We failed in our attempt
this time.

00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:11.406
Now the leader's ready.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.533
Fong is a problem.

00:42:14.283 --> 00:42:15.493
But we can still do it.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.037
Sir, but now
we're under suspicion.

00:42:18.246 --> 00:42:19.580
So what?

00:42:20.039 --> 00:42:21.999
If we're under suspicion,

00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:24.752
I have information
that there's a secret

00:42:24.836 --> 00:42:26.587
about Mr. Chan

00:42:26.671 --> 00:42:29.257
in the container
that the samurai brought

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.425
to the mandarin.

00:42:30.508 --> 00:42:31.509
We'll get it.

00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:33.636
[Chan] I'm concerned
that someone may

00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:35.513
try to steal
the sacred box.

00:42:36.347 --> 00:42:37.432
If that should happen,

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.393
then I'm afraid
my chances of ruling

00:42:40.476 --> 00:42:41.477
will be gone.

00:42:41.561 --> 00:42:43.479
Master, the mandarin's daughter

00:42:43.563 --> 00:42:45.314
seems to be fond
of Sai Yuk.

00:42:45.398 --> 00:42:46.774
Why not send him
after it?

00:42:47.233 --> 00:42:48.526
I don't think so.

00:42:49.777 --> 00:42:51.237
It's too dangerous
for him.

00:42:52.655 --> 00:42:54.866
But, sir,
please think about it.

00:42:55.241 --> 00:42:57.410
The mandarin's daughter
would know

00:42:57.493 --> 00:43:00.037
exactly where her father's
secrets are kept.

00:43:00.121 --> 00:43:01.831
Don't you agree
with that?

00:43:02.165 --> 00:43:04.459
You see, sir,
I've composed a letter.

00:43:04.667 --> 00:43:06.043
[Sai Yuk]
Are you here, Godfather?

00:43:08.504 --> 00:43:09.505
Sai Yuk, what is it?

00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:10.840
My mother made some soup.

00:43:11.048 --> 00:43:12.717
[Chan] I have another
assignment for you.

00:43:12.967 --> 00:43:15.845
- Yes?
- Listen, the box was located.

00:43:15.928 --> 00:43:16.804
Good, then.

00:43:16.888 --> 00:43:19.348
That shows that
anything can be done.

00:43:19.432 --> 00:43:20.433
Precisely.

00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:21.851
Except
it isn't finished.

00:43:21.934 --> 00:43:23.769
Right.
What's the mission?

00:43:24.228 --> 00:43:25.313
Here.

00:43:25.396 --> 00:43:26.355
Take a look.

00:43:30.276 --> 00:43:32.236
This is a love letter
from me.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.696
Uh, yes.

00:43:33.779 --> 00:43:35.740
This is just how you begin
your assignment--

00:43:36.032 --> 00:43:37.200
Talking to a woman

00:43:37.408 --> 00:43:40.244
and thereby establishing
some kind of way

00:43:40.328 --> 00:43:42.288
to win her trust,
so she'll help us.

00:43:42.371 --> 00:43:43.372
Understand?

00:43:44.165 --> 00:43:46.334
But, wait. No, no, no.
No, no, no.

00:43:46.417 --> 00:43:48.377
But what--what if my wife
finds out about it?

00:43:48.461 --> 00:43:50.171
Hey, now, don't you
worry about it.

00:43:50.254 --> 00:43:51.631
I mean, who's going
to tell her?

00:43:52.048 --> 00:43:53.257
I suppose.

00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:56.302
But should I pretend
that I'm in love?

00:43:57.011 --> 00:43:58.054
It's up to you.

00:43:58.137 --> 00:43:59.764
I just want you
to get close to her.

00:44:00.181 --> 00:44:01.599
And have sex with her?

00:44:01.807 --> 00:44:02.934
No sex.

00:44:03.476 --> 00:44:04.977
You get my box.

00:44:05.228 --> 00:44:06.646
You're going
to the Mandarin Palace.

00:44:06.938 --> 00:44:07.939
That's where
you'll meet her.

00:44:08.147 --> 00:44:10.733
Is this girl someone
that I've seen yet?

00:44:10.942 --> 00:44:12.068
Yes.

00:44:12.151 --> 00:44:14.654
You will recognise her
when you see her face.

00:44:15.029 --> 00:44:17.114
I hope she won't want
to get married.

00:44:17.657 --> 00:44:19.617
- That would be a disaster.
- [Yun] Mr. Chan,

00:44:20.326 --> 00:44:22.370
what about me, sir?

00:44:24.288 --> 00:44:25.706
I'll volunteer to go.

00:44:26.457 --> 00:44:27.583
Yeah.

00:44:28.125 --> 00:44:29.418
He could take my place.

00:44:29.794 --> 00:44:31.379
But you're not
a ladies' man. Ow!

00:44:32.421 --> 00:44:33.589
Listen!

00:44:33.798 --> 00:44:35.633
He failed on
the previous mission.

00:44:36.634 --> 00:44:38.177
Now it's my turn to try.

00:44:38.553 --> 00:44:40.680
But your father worked
against the mandarin.

00:44:40.888 --> 00:44:42.557
They wouldn't let you in
without a fight.

00:44:43.015 --> 00:44:44.767
Sai Yuk isn't known
to them at all.

00:44:45.643 --> 00:44:46.727
Yes...

00:44:47.103 --> 00:44:48.354
and she really likes him.

00:44:48.437 --> 00:44:49.605
We'll see.

00:44:49.897 --> 00:44:51.399
We'll see.

00:44:51.482 --> 00:44:52.775
I just might succeed.

00:44:53.067 --> 00:44:54.151
You betting on it?

00:44:54.402 --> 00:44:56.195
Certainly. Why don't
we set a wager?

00:44:56.279 --> 00:44:57.905
What is your bet?

00:44:58.281 --> 00:44:59.865
If I lose,
I'll find a way

00:44:59.949 --> 00:45:01.158
to destroy my kung fu.

00:45:01.617 --> 00:45:02.743
All right, then.

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.580
Don't be worried.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.125
[Soo Li] "A chance meeting
along the riverbank

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.503
and now I have
only fate to thank.

00:45:13.045 --> 00:45:16.007
I long for a word, a glance, a look.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.467
I remain your servant,
Fong Sai Yuk."

00:45:20.428 --> 00:45:22.138
Oh, how wonderful!

00:45:24.056 --> 00:45:26.225
[laughs]

00:45:43.701 --> 00:45:44.827
[gasps]

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.995
Dad.

00:45:52.251 --> 00:45:54.462
A young man
wants to court me.

00:45:55.254 --> 00:45:57.548
I know that
you'll like him.

00:45:59.967 --> 00:46:01.802
So, who is
this young man?

00:46:02.261 --> 00:46:03.554
Is he a scoundrel?

00:46:03.638 --> 00:46:05.097
No. He's not.

00:46:06.891 --> 00:46:09.310
Well, then, if he wants
to court you,

00:46:09.727 --> 00:46:10.895
he'll have to
prove himself.

00:46:10.978 --> 00:46:12.104
Well, that's perfect.

00:46:17.902 --> 00:46:20.112
Mum, shouldn't I tell
Ting Ting?

00:46:20.196 --> 00:46:21.530
No. There she is.

00:46:21.822 --> 00:46:22.823
Hold this.

00:46:23.199 --> 00:46:24.533
Wait.
I don't want it.

00:46:24.617 --> 00:46:25.534
You hold it.

00:46:25.618 --> 00:46:26.827
All right.
Listen.

00:46:27.244 --> 00:46:28.829
Yeah?
What should I do?

00:46:28.913 --> 00:46:30.164
You should just
kiss her, that's what.

00:46:30.247 --> 00:46:31.332
Don't play shy.

00:46:31.415 --> 00:46:32.708
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

00:46:33.167 --> 00:46:34.752
Just go right over there
and give her one.

00:46:34.835 --> 00:46:36.045
- Right here?
- There she is.

00:46:36.253 --> 00:46:37.254
Okay, then.

00:46:47.181 --> 00:46:49.392
Let's get to it, hmm?

00:46:51.394 --> 00:46:54.438
You've come to me
at long last.

00:46:55.272 --> 00:46:57.316
- But we, uh--
- Are you scared?

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.401
Ma?

00:46:58.484 --> 00:46:59.944
I'll fix that.

00:47:00.653 --> 00:47:02.279
Come on.
Don't be afraid.

00:47:02.738 --> 00:47:03.989
You should've
kissed him.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.950
Hmmph!

00:47:07.618 --> 00:47:09.370
She wants you
all the more.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.913
What's the matter?

00:47:10.996 --> 00:47:12.039
Nothing.

00:47:13.124 --> 00:47:14.959
You don't want to let
her get away now.

00:47:15.376 --> 00:47:16.585
Better go.

00:47:18.629 --> 00:47:19.922
All right. Unh!

00:47:20.965 --> 00:47:21.966
Ooh!

00:47:28.347 --> 00:47:29.432
That was easy.

00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:31.100
Oh!

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.477
Mmm.

00:47:33.728 --> 00:47:36.063
What are you doing?
Go after her.

00:47:36.439 --> 00:47:38.023
What?
You mean...

00:47:38.816 --> 00:47:40.526
You kissed
one of the Buddhist nuns?

00:47:41.402 --> 00:47:43.738
Hey, it could be the first
kiss that she ever got.

00:47:43.821 --> 00:47:45.114
- Now come on.
- Okay.

00:47:45.322 --> 00:47:46.449
She might ask you
for more.

00:47:46.532 --> 00:47:47.992
Ahh! Ahh!

00:47:50.077 --> 00:47:51.579
I must've
scared her away.

00:47:51.662 --> 00:47:52.830
Maybe she doesn't
want me.

00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:54.832
- Oh, stop it.
- Stop what?

00:47:54.915 --> 00:47:55.916
[Soo Li] Sai Yuk,

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.585
do you want to
marry me or not?

00:47:57.668 --> 00:48:00.045
Sure, I do, but there's
one condition.

00:48:00.337 --> 00:48:01.422
Well, what is it?

00:48:01.505 --> 00:48:02.506
That box you have.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.383
All right.
I can get it somehow,

00:48:04.467 --> 00:48:05.926
but you'll also have
to prove yourself

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.178
in a competition
you'll win,

00:48:07.428 --> 00:48:09.221
and you'll also
declare your love.

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.681
- Deal.
- Bet on it.

00:48:40.628 --> 00:48:42.505
The competition
will soon start.

00:48:43.756 --> 00:48:46.300
The winner
will marry Sho Soo Li.

00:48:47.009 --> 00:48:49.553
The rules are simple,
so now listen.

00:48:50.179 --> 00:48:52.348
Whichever man
retrieves the flowered ball

00:48:52.431 --> 00:48:54.099
from the top
of the bridal sedan,

00:48:54.391 --> 00:48:56.018
I shall proclaim
the winner,

00:48:56.101 --> 00:48:58.145
and then he will also wed
my daughter.

00:48:59.271 --> 00:49:01.774
The true competition
will now begin.

00:49:02.149 --> 00:49:03.651
[Playing fanfare]

00:49:05.945 --> 00:49:07.655
[Crowd] Ohh.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.491
Ooh, what
arresting beauty.

00:49:12.493 --> 00:49:13.869
[Soo Li] Where is he?

00:49:17.039 --> 00:49:18.749
She'll make
a fine bride.

00:49:19.625 --> 00:49:20.584
Too bad.

00:49:20.918 --> 00:49:22.294
Too bad
she'll be mine.

00:49:22.628 --> 00:49:23.838
I'll win.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.090
She'll be
my wife

00:49:26.298 --> 00:49:27.550
once I'm
finished.

00:49:28.259 --> 00:49:30.636
Sorry, my friends,

00:49:31.345 --> 00:49:32.471
I'm going to win.

00:49:32.721 --> 00:49:33.973
Contestants, get ready.

00:49:34.265 --> 00:49:35.599
[Men grunt]

00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:37.059
And start!

00:49:37.142 --> 00:49:38.602
[Yelling]

00:50:21.145 --> 00:50:22.563
Kick them!

00:50:34.658 --> 00:50:36.118
[Men Yelling]

00:51:02.478 --> 00:51:03.646
Mmm!

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.297
I told you we'd be late
carrying this flagpole.

00:52:12.631 --> 00:52:14.758
Don't worry. These guys
can't keep us out.

00:52:15.634 --> 00:52:16.593
[Both] What do you want?

00:52:17.011 --> 00:52:18.721
- The girl.
- The kung fu contest.

00:52:18.804 --> 00:52:20.305
- He's too late.
- Am I?

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:24.518
Hmm.

00:52:25.394 --> 00:52:26.311
Ohh! Aah!

00:52:26.395 --> 00:52:27.980
[Laughter]

00:52:32.901 --> 00:52:34.403
Aha! Oh!

00:52:47.082 --> 00:52:47.958
Ooh.

00:52:56.258 --> 00:52:57.426
[Man] Hey!

00:53:00.971 --> 00:53:02.056
Hello.

00:53:04.141 --> 00:53:05.225
- Huh?
- Hey, there.

00:53:08.687 --> 00:53:10.355
Aah!

00:53:10.981 --> 00:53:12.608
[Crowd] Ohh!

00:53:17.029 --> 00:53:18.030
Yeah.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.703
About time
you made it.

00:53:24.787 --> 00:53:25.788
I'm sorry.

00:53:27.039 --> 00:53:27.956
Have you been waiting?

00:53:29.166 --> 00:53:30.501
So long.

00:53:30.793 --> 00:53:31.877
Bored yet?

00:53:33.587 --> 00:53:35.214
Hey, don't get thrown off.

00:53:37.841 --> 00:53:40.094
Well, men,
have a nice ride down.

00:53:54.108 --> 00:53:55.150
Are you ready?

00:53:55.234 --> 00:53:57.319
I was hoping you were
going to ask me that.

00:54:02.533 --> 00:54:03.534
All right.

00:54:07.246 --> 00:54:08.789
[All] Aah!

00:54:14.545 --> 00:54:15.546
Good, huh?

00:54:15.629 --> 00:54:16.755
Wow.

00:54:17.005 --> 00:54:18.632
Just amazing. Huh?

00:54:23.887 --> 00:54:26.014
I know.
You want me to jump.

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:29.518
Hai!

00:54:30.102 --> 00:54:31.019
- Whoo.
- Let's go.

00:54:33.147 --> 00:54:34.481
Thanks.

00:54:44.992 --> 00:54:46.076
What? Huh?

00:54:46.535 --> 00:54:48.328
- Hmm?
- What's the matter?

00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:50.122
Can't you look me in the eye?

00:54:50.205 --> 00:54:51.748
Ahh. Ready?

00:54:51.957 --> 00:54:53.375
Hey, wait.

00:54:53.625 --> 00:54:54.710
I'm shocked.

00:54:54.793 --> 00:54:55.711
Wait a minute.

00:54:55.794 --> 00:54:57.212
Come on.
Let me explain.

00:54:57.296 --> 00:54:58.589
Have you gone crazy?

00:54:58.881 --> 00:55:01.008
Didn't you think
I'd find out about this?

00:55:01.091 --> 00:55:03.510
- Well, yes, but there's more to this...
- I don't want to hear it.

00:55:03.594 --> 00:55:04.720
...than there seems
to be right now.

00:55:04.803 --> 00:55:06.054
- I'm not going to listen.
- If you'd listen--

00:55:06.138 --> 00:55:07.139
I'm not!

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:09.433
That might've hurt.

00:55:09.641 --> 00:55:10.767
How about this?

00:55:12.311 --> 00:55:13.478
[Crowd] Oh!

00:55:15.772 --> 00:55:16.899
Come on, settle down.

00:55:16.982 --> 00:55:17.900
I'm not done.

00:55:18.817 --> 00:55:20.027
Be sensible.

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:21.069
I will not.

00:55:22.863 --> 00:55:24.281
Why is she bothering us?

00:55:25.908 --> 00:55:26.825
Uh--

00:55:26.909 --> 00:55:30.329
I'll tell you why.
I'm his wife.

00:55:31.288 --> 00:55:32.289
Don't believe it.

00:55:32.956 --> 00:55:34.791
Oh, two can play at that.

00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:36.210
All right.

00:55:36.793 --> 00:55:38.003
Wait!

00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:51.308
Creep!

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:00.108
There must be
a better way.

[Straining]

00:56:09.701 --> 00:56:10.869
Let me at them.

00:56:18.085 --> 00:56:19.378
[Ting Ting] Ohh!

00:56:21.296 --> 00:56:22.464
Ma.

00:56:24.299 --> 00:56:25.300
You asked for it.

00:56:25.842 --> 00:56:27.261
Will you help me
break this up?

00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:28.971
- Who should I take?
- That one.

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:31.556
- Li, come on.
- Ting Ting.

00:56:31.765 --> 00:56:33.475
- Please, stop fighting.
- Come on now.

00:56:34.685 --> 00:56:37.062
Listen, he's doing--
he doesn't love her.

00:56:37.145 --> 00:56:38.355
Well, I don't care.

00:56:38.438 --> 00:56:40.065
Someone should've mentioned
something to me.

00:56:40.148 --> 00:56:41.858
Hey, you wouldn't have
wanted him to do it.

00:56:41.942 --> 00:56:42.943
- Come on now, Li.
- Let me go.

00:56:43.026 --> 00:56:45.320
Let me go. I'll make you
into a slave.

00:56:45.529 --> 00:56:46.780
Let me see you
try it.

00:56:47.155 --> 00:56:48.824

Please, please.

Hey, take it easy.

00:56:51.785 --> 00:56:53.829
The minute he realises
what kind of woman you are,

00:56:53.912 --> 00:56:55.580
he'll drop her
like an old habit.

00:56:55.664 --> 00:56:57.165
- Whoa now!
- Why?

00:56:57.249 --> 00:56:58.667
Well, it was
for Mr. Chan.

00:56:59.418 --> 00:57:00.919
All right. If you don't
care about her,

00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:02.879
- then go slap her.
- I will.

00:57:03.297 --> 00:57:04.298
Stop.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:06.466
You want that box?

00:57:07.509 --> 00:57:08.719
Huh?

00:57:08.802 --> 00:57:09.761
All right.
then I'll do it.

away from Sai Yuk.

not you.

Just ask him
if you don't believe me.

Unless you're afraid to.

Hmm?

Why won't you
look at me?

00:57:27.112 --> 00:57:30.032
- But--
- So, I'll jump, then.

Stop it. Why won't you
let me fall?

00:57:50.052 --> 00:57:52.179
[Strains] I won't.
You're my wife.

00:57:52.429 --> 00:57:54.097
I'm supposed to be
your only wife.

00:57:57.768 --> 00:57:58.685

00:58:04.024 --> 00:58:05.025
[Soo Li] So strong.

00:58:05.108 --> 00:58:06.568
Just like you are
in bed.

Hmm. Ha ha!

00:58:08.153 --> 00:58:09.571
You took her to bed?

00:58:09.863 --> 00:58:12.115
All right. Let me loose,
and I'll fall, okay?

00:58:12.616 --> 00:58:13.867
What are you doing?

She's making it up.

Let me go!

an old lady, huh?

Oh, boy. Uhh!

my new son-in-law.

I love you,

The outside world

00:59:59.389 --> 01:00:01.349

to the wedded couple.

in its tender embrace

01:00:07.772 --> 01:00:09.566

as companions.

Whoops. Huh?

Lei Ling, I don't want
to hear that right now.

Shall I sing a song
instead?

01:00:30.504 --> 01:00:31.880
I keep remembering

01:00:32.839 --> 01:00:35.884
Sai Yuk reciting
those words to me.

01:00:39.012 --> 01:00:40.764
What do you say?
Shall we?

01:00:41.473 --> 01:00:42.641
What's your hurry?

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:45.435
I'll keep my end
of the bargain

as long as you keep yours.

[Soo Li] What do you
really want?

01:00:50.357 --> 01:00:52.108
Me or what's in
your old box?

01:00:52.192 --> 01:00:54.361
What?
You know I want the box.

01:00:55.946 --> 01:00:56.905

you're going?

- To church.
- To eat.

Is that so?

01:01:57.841 --> 01:01:59.467
You used deception on us.

to get what you wanted.

I'll take back the box

01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:09.269
you stole from her.

Is that what she said?
Now, how can that be?

01:02:12.272 --> 01:02:13.481
Why don't you
ask her again?

01:02:13.565 --> 01:02:15.275
Enough of your fooling.

come from, huh?

the box.

then I die.

your own life?

rather see it burned?

Ah, you want me
to destroy it,

so no one
can learn the truth.

I must've been blind

not to see
such an ambitious man,

I don't think
you have the box at all.

01:08:20.556 --> 01:08:23.101
Would you listen to me?
All his nerve endings are intact.

01:08:23.184 --> 01:08:24.602
We can bring
his skill back.

01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:26.187
- Do you mean it?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:30.483
[Mother] Sai Yuk.

01:08:30.817 --> 01:08:31.818
Sai Yuk.

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:34.529
Ma...

01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:36.114
make sure he gets it.

01:08:36.364 --> 01:08:37.907
Ah, so the box
showed up...

01:08:40.034 --> 01:08:42.578
and Mr. Chan is really
the emperor.

01:08:42.662 --> 01:08:43.663
Emperor?

01:08:44.497 --> 01:08:45.623
But that means trouble.

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:47.291
I'll destroy it
as soon as possible.

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:48.334
- Hey.
- What?

01:08:48.418 --> 01:08:50.336
Don't you dare destroy it.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.587
This will come in handy.

01:08:51.671 --> 01:08:53.715
[Woman] Li Dong,
open up. It's me.

01:08:56.092 --> 01:08:57.135
I came to warn you all.

01:08:57.218 --> 01:08:58.344
Yun and his men
are on the way.

01:08:58.428 --> 01:08:59.345
That's it.

01:08:59.762 --> 01:09:00.930
- Faster.
- All right. Now hurry.

01:09:01.014 --> 01:09:02.849
- Let's get out of here.
- We have to be faster.

01:09:06.602 --> 01:09:07.895
Unh.

01:09:11.691 --> 01:09:12.859
Have Fong read it.

01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:15.319
The book on nerve blocking.
Thank you.

01:09:15.403 --> 01:09:18.781
They're here. Make sure he reads it all.
Better get moving now. Go!

01:09:21.242 --> 01:09:23.036
- Come on!
- Over there!

01:09:23.119 --> 01:09:24.412
[Man] Surround the house!

01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:29.751
Company, halt! Come out!

01:09:31.544 --> 01:09:33.546
Fong Sai Yuk,
your day has come.

01:09:36.257 --> 01:09:37.550
He won't be needed!

01:09:37.633 --> 01:09:40.053
[Laughing]

01:09:42.221 --> 01:09:43.139
You know what?

01:09:43.723 --> 01:09:45.433
This is your day to die!

01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:47.268
I wouldn't be so sure
about it.

01:09:47.351 --> 01:09:48.436
Go get him!

01:10:06.829 --> 01:10:07.830
Not too bad, eh?

01:10:08.206 --> 01:10:09.457
Wait until you see
my nerve blocking.

01:10:11.084 --> 01:10:13.419
[Clucks]

01:10:36.984 --> 01:10:39.737
Aah!

01:10:40.154 --> 01:10:41.781
Here, why don't
you take him?

01:10:42.115 --> 01:10:43.199
I'm going back.

01:10:44.826 --> 01:10:45.743
Can you help him?

01:10:47.328 --> 01:10:49.330
- Please.
- I'll try. Who are you?

01:10:49.539 --> 01:10:50.873
We're getting married.

01:10:52.375 --> 01:10:54.127
Please,
take care of him.

01:10:55.211 --> 01:10:58.714
Where is he? Talk!

01:10:58.798 --> 01:10:59.882
Go to hell.

01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:05.638
Hey, are you all right?

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.015
Find him outside, men!
Go get him!

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:19.944
Aah!

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:22.280
Dong! Oh, my God!

01:11:22.363 --> 01:11:24.157
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.491
[Groans]

01:11:25.867 --> 01:11:26.868
No.

01:11:27.326 --> 01:11:30.746
I must...
have been rusty.

01:11:31.038 --> 01:11:33.916
It's been a while
between fights.

01:11:34.417 --> 01:11:35.751
[Groans]

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:39.130
I should have...

01:11:41.007 --> 01:11:44.969
ohh, I should have
stayed out of it.

01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:46.971
[Groans]

01:11:47.597 --> 01:11:49.390
But you were so brave.

01:11:50.057 --> 01:11:51.100
You saved me.

01:11:52.935 --> 01:11:57.315
Th-that would be
the first time

01:11:57.982 --> 01:12:01.861
I've saved anyone
in a while.

01:12:02.695 --> 01:12:05.198
[Groans] Oh, God.

01:12:06.115 --> 01:12:07.325
Keep my

01:12:08.492 --> 01:12:11.871
memory alive.

01:12:12.872 --> 01:12:14.165
Please.

01:12:17.084 --> 01:12:18.211
Please.

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:22.381
I promise.

01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:27.094
I won't forget.

01:12:28.429 --> 01:12:30.139
[Sobbing]

01:12:40.733 --> 01:12:43.569
[Footsteps]

01:12:48.616 --> 01:12:50.201
[Yun] I believe...

01:12:52.995 --> 01:12:55.790
this is what
you've been looking for.

01:12:57.291 --> 01:13:01.128
It tells me
a great deal about you...

01:13:01.879 --> 01:13:03.422
the would-be emperor.

01:13:04.131 --> 01:13:06.384
You are powerless
without your followers.

01:13:06.926 --> 01:13:08.886
We have laid waste to them.

01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:11.264
As I will to you!

01:13:15.393 --> 01:13:16.477
Not yet.

01:13:17.186 --> 01:13:20.356
Your fight with me is liable
to be your final fight.

01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:23.985
Well, do you suppose
I'd come without my men?

01:13:25.069 --> 01:13:26.487
Go ahead.

01:13:28.281 --> 01:13:29.782
See what happens
to your men.

01:13:30.366 --> 01:13:31.867
- No. I can't.
- [Men] Kill him!

01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:34.328
Go ahead! What are you trying
to prove to us?

01:13:34.578 --> 01:13:36.414
Once again,
the leader is now Yun.

01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:38.416
You begin following me!

01:13:38.833 --> 01:13:40.584
You have given me
no option.

01:13:41.252 --> 01:13:43.296
I will not
allow men to die.

01:13:43.879 --> 01:13:45.256
You have the advantage.

01:13:45.673 --> 01:13:48.134
I will not permit
any more suffering.

01:13:48.801 --> 01:13:52.138
So, now, our society
is at your disposal.

01:14:00.104 --> 01:14:03.316
Brethren, once again
the Yun family rules.

01:14:03.774 --> 01:14:06.610
It was all worthwhile.
Ha ha ha!

01:14:06.694 --> 01:14:08.237
All hail
the master!

01:14:08.321 --> 01:14:11.741
[All] Hail Master Yun!

01:14:13.326 --> 01:14:15.411
Mr. Yun, sir,
what about the woman?

01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:17.538
- Huh?
- There!

01:14:20.875 --> 01:14:22.335
[Groans]

01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:23.711
Ha ha ha!

01:14:23.961 --> 01:14:26.922
Ah, yes,
you always reminded me

01:14:27.423 --> 01:14:28.674
of a mother hen.

01:14:29.467 --> 01:14:32.762
Except that you look after
a flock of only one.

01:14:32.845 --> 01:14:35.348
Let's see now,
I have something for you,

01:14:35.431 --> 01:14:38.184
mother hen! Ha ha ha!

01:14:47.151 --> 01:14:49.987
[Man] Get her!
Ha ha! Get her!

01:14:50.237 --> 01:14:52.990
You're nothing but
a meddling old woman!

01:14:54.825 --> 01:14:56.160
Ha ha ha!

[Men Laughing]

01:15:12.134 --> 01:15:15.221
We'll see how many days

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:18.808
you survive. Ha ha ha!

"The art of nerve blocking."

Here you are,
Sai Yuk.

01:15:58.681 --> 01:16:00.266
Have you heard
from my mother?

01:16:04.395 --> 01:16:08.023
But it's been a month.
That can't be.

01:16:09.692 --> 01:16:10.818
Who's there?

01:16:11.861 --> 01:16:13.946
I've come about
your godfather.

01:16:14.029 --> 01:16:15.614
They're holding him
prisoner.

01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:17.450
- And my mother?
- It's bad.

01:16:18.367 --> 01:16:20.161
She's barely surviving.

01:16:21.036 --> 01:16:22.538
They've hung her
in the square.

Ma! Unh!

01:16:25.791 --> 01:16:27.710
Sai Yuk, you must rest.

01:16:27.918 --> 01:16:29.753
You can rely on the
others to help her now.

01:16:29.837 --> 01:16:32.715
No. The others
are mostly dead.

01:16:33.674 --> 01:16:35.342
Those that have survived

01:16:36.177 --> 01:16:38.387
are being held prisoner
with Mr. Chan.

Our army does not
exist anymore.

There is no one left
to fight them, Mr. Fong.

Show me what's left of
your kung fu skills!

01:25:16.989 --> 01:25:18.323
Ha ha ha!

01:25:18.907 --> 01:25:21.576
Come on. You can get up
and show him.

01:26:03.994 --> 01:26:05.746
- We'll beat him together.
- All right.

01:26:05.829 --> 01:26:06.788
I'll kill you both!

01:26:21.344 --> 01:26:22.846
- Do it now!
- Let's do it!

01:26:32.189 --> 01:26:33.356
He'll wear himself out.

01:26:37.611 --> 01:26:39.112
Aagh!

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:40.989
Come on!

01:26:41.406 --> 01:26:42.491
Which one is
the fatal nerve?

01:26:42.824 --> 01:26:44.201
On the spine!

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.620
Aah!

01:26:47.913 --> 01:26:50.248
It's called the stone dragon,
and it works like this.

01:26:56.630 --> 01:26:58.006
That's it! Good!

01:26:58.090 --> 01:26:59.341
I guess I remembered!

01:27:20.779 --> 01:27:22.781
Hyah!

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:34.709
All right!

01:27:37.295 --> 01:27:40.298
Aah!

01:27:42.634 --> 01:27:43.718
Mother!

01:27:43.802 --> 01:27:45.762
Oh, well,
that wasn't so bad, was it?

01:27:46.638 --> 01:27:48.723
[Both] Well, at least
you could thank us now.

01:27:48.807 --> 01:27:49.933
Thanks.

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:51.518
What are you doing here?

01:27:52.811 --> 01:27:53.979
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

01:27:54.062 --> 01:27:55.689
He shouldn't be sitting
up there like that.

01:27:55.772 --> 01:27:57.774
Oh, he won't be
bothering anybody.

01:27:57.983 --> 01:28:00.443
Well, thanks to us, right?
Let's go.

01:28:02.654 --> 01:28:03.655
Hmm?

01:28:04.739 --> 01:28:06.908
[Horses Neighing]

01:28:07.659 --> 01:28:11.288
[Men Shouting]

01:28:15.292 --> 01:28:16.710
The troops
are coming.

01:28:20.297 --> 01:28:22.048
- Get them!
- Open it up!

01:28:23.216 --> 01:28:26.678
[Men Cheering]

01:28:27.262 --> 01:28:28.555
Sir!

01:28:30.015 --> 01:28:31.141
It's our side.

01:28:52.037 --> 01:28:53.872
Sai Yuk, why don't you
return with us?

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.499
I can't. I've got to be
going my own way.

01:28:57.334 --> 01:28:59.252
Too bad. The society
will miss you.

01:28:59.461 --> 01:29:00.712
[Mother]
Don't worry, Mr. Chan.

01:29:00.795 --> 01:29:03.131
If you need his assistance
for anything,

01:29:03.215 --> 01:29:04.132
you'll have it.

01:29:04.216 --> 01:29:05.467
Thank you so much.

01:29:05.842 --> 01:29:08.887
It looks like you'll have
your hands full as it is.

01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:10.138
You said it.

01:29:10.597 --> 01:29:12.265
I want to give you
something nice.

01:29:12.349 --> 01:29:14.100
But I really want for you
to have my gift now.

01:29:14.517 --> 01:29:16.937
- Now!
- But listen, Sai Yuk's grandfather

01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:18.855
gave it to him when
he was just a boy.

01:29:18.939 --> 01:29:21.274
He told me the same thing
about this very one.

01:29:22.776 --> 01:29:24.402
How could the both
of us have--

01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:27.530
I have so many
of these things.

01:29:28.823 --> 01:29:30.825
I'd like you to take one.

01:29:31.368 --> 01:29:32.452
Aah!

01:29:33.912 --> 01:29:35.622
- You're very kind.
- Okay. How about you?

01:29:36.081 --> 01:29:38.583
Would you like one?
I've got about a million of 'em.

01:29:38.667 --> 01:29:40.377
We should try to
talk more often.

01:29:40.919 --> 01:29:42.170
[Both] Sai Yuk!

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.506
Oh, my.
Well, see you later!

01:29:44.589 --> 01:29:46.091
[Both]
Sai Yuk, slow down!

01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:50.136
I guess I'll see you later.

01:29:51.012 --> 01:29:52.514
Ha ha! Best of luck!

01:29:53.139 --> 01:29:55.558
- [Sai Yuk] They're catching up.
- [Soo Li] What a cheap trinket!

01:29:55.767 --> 01:29:57.060
How many other girls
did you give them to?!

01:29:57.143 --> 01:29:58.353
[Ting Ting] I can't believe you gave us
the same present!

01:29:58.436 --> 01:29:59.854
[Mother] Ladies, wait!

01:29:59.938 --> 01:30:04.442
