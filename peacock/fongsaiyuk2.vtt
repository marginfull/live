00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.300
[Mother] The seed falls
and with time,

00:02:12.384 --> 00:02:15.387
is carried far from
the tree that bore it.

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:19.057
Yet the seed longs
to return...

00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:22.310
for the tree...

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:24.146
is filled with memories.

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:26.148
- Ma!
- Fong, save yourself!

00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:27.941
No way! You need
my protection!

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:36.283
[Mother]
Memories that are joyful

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:39.327
and memories
that are filled with pain.

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.455
Ooh, ow. It hurts.

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:43.874
It would have been worse
if I hadn't shielded you.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:45.292
Please, Dad, no!

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:50.589
I'm coming home! Yeah!

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:55.802
- Aah! Look out!
- Hey, you look great!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.721
Aah!

00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:02.059
[Mother]
He longs to return...

00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:04.603
no matter
how great the distance...

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:06.438
or how barren
the terrain...

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:10.442
because the memory is so strong
and lasting and clear.

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:16.656
Its images are glimpsed
through time's pallid veil...

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.284
like an apparition.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:20.911
Come on, come on!

00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:23.455
Coming unbidden,
a shadow--

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:25.791
Wait a minute. Unh!

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.711
A shadow,
a whispering wind,

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:31.088
calling his name.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.589
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.885
Ha ha! Hyah!

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:41.431
[Horse Neighs]

00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:44.142
[Parade Music]

00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:01.034
[Chan] Our people have
been looking forward

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:02.494
to this celebration.

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:05.539
Ha ha ha! Yes, good.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:08.917
[Cheering]

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:12.129
It pleases me to see them
enjoying themselves.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.297
Ahh. Sai Yuk.

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:16.925
Do you know how lucky
we both are?

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:18.468
This is the way
it should be.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.846
[Waiter] Go away!
We don't allow begging here!

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.431
- No! Go away!
- Sir, it's for the poor.

00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:26.143
- Don't you understand--
- I told you there's no begging here.

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.102
Now go away.

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:27.978
Hey! Can't you--

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.479
Hey, he's with me.

00:04:30.397 --> 00:04:32.315
- Bless you, my son.
- Sorry. I didn't know.

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:37.112
Aie!

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.905
Only a minute ago
you threw him out.

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:40.490
- Shall we?
- Fine.

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:43.994
Ow. My knees.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:51.459
What hit me?

00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:01.261
Reverend, there's plenty
to eat, so go on.

00:05:01.553 --> 00:05:03.221
Ah, bless you.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.932
Allow me the great honour

00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:08.143
of reading
your fortune tonight.

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.939
I foresee that you will lead
an extraordinary life.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.565
- Me?
- That's nothing.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.193
He already has
an extraordinary wife.

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.154
Yes, I'm sure.

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.073
You will bring him
happiness.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.410
I foresee that you
will have one boy child

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.619
and one girl.

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.830
- Isn't that wonderful?
- No more?

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:35.001
I predict a minimum
of two girls and two boys

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.169
for you, sir.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:37.504
That's great!

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.718
Wait, sir, do you mean
that I'll--

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:46.053
Yes, you comprehend.

00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:48.222
- But, uh...
- Mmm!

00:05:49.765 --> 00:05:51.016
Wait! Ting Ting!

00:05:51.308 --> 00:05:52.935
Reverend, help yourself.
I've got to go.

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:54.144
Ting Ting! Wait!

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:56.063
Wait! I'm not finished!

00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:58.522
Don't go away!

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:02.610
I'm afraid my godson
is always in such a big hurry.

00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:05.571
Sir, you beware.

00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:08.741
Your face is clouded
with evil.

00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:11.494
You're mistaken.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:14.080
No. It seems clear to me.

00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:16.623
Your palm.

00:06:17.332 --> 00:06:19.751
[Chuckles]
All right. Go on.

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:23.672
Emperor!

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:28.635
Good sir, why are you
calling me emperor?

00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:30.470
Because I saw it.

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:33.890
The markings on
your hand are those

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.851
that only one of
the royal line would have.

00:06:41.163 --> 00:06:44.192
[Woman] My son, it is no longer
safe for you here.

00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:46.124
You will go to Japan

00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:48.100
to live under
the protection of Mr. Yun,

00:06:48.318 --> 00:06:50.557
leader of
the Red Flower Society.

00:06:51.128 --> 00:06:53.368
Your new name
will be Chan Ka Lok.

00:06:53.763 --> 00:06:55.694
Inside of this sacred box

00:06:55.783 --> 00:06:58.768
are documents which prove
your true birthright.

00:06:59.075 --> 00:07:00.787
One day, when it is safe,

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.597
I hope that you will be able
to return to the throne.

00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:06.802
[Shouting]

00:07:22.914 --> 00:07:24.144
Ahem.

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:28.929
Yes.
You should be cautious

00:07:29.017 --> 00:07:30.158
about what
you tell people.

00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:31.827
I'm telling you
what I saw.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.320
Nothing more.

00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:37.797
I'm...I'm sensing a man

00:07:37.886 --> 00:07:40.212
who is close to you
will betray you...

00:07:40.432 --> 00:07:44.471
yet another person close
will be there to protect you.

00:07:44.954 --> 00:07:46.315
Perhaps save your life.

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:51.891
Sai Yuk, when do
we get to be alone?

00:07:51.978 --> 00:07:53.603
I thought
we were married.

00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:55.228
Doesn't seem
that way now.

00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:58.389
Don't be silly.
I love you.

00:07:59.004 --> 00:08:02.604
Oh. Then maybe you can
show your feelings.

00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:05.106
[Whispering]

00:08:05.326 --> 00:08:08.794
Wait, you mean make
an ass of myself?

00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:10.287
They'd laugh
at me.

00:08:10.682 --> 00:08:11.998
They might laugh...

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:13.930
but I need to
hear it from you

00:08:14.018 --> 00:08:14.896
once in awhile.

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:16.433
Hmm. All right then.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.657
If it's a problem,
well, I'm sorry.

00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:23.546
Lay down here with me.

00:08:25.082 --> 00:08:26.794
All right, then.

00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:30.174
Good. But don't
make it sound wrong.

00:08:30.614 --> 00:08:32.722
Hmm. All right.

00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:36.761
I love you. Good?

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:38.341
Let's try it again.

00:08:38.824 --> 00:08:39.965
Can you say it?

00:08:40.272 --> 00:08:42.994
- All right. I love you.
- Oh.

00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:47.297
What?
Beat it right now.

00:08:47.516 --> 00:08:49.492
What he said
was pretty nice.

00:08:50.107 --> 00:08:52.083
I'd like to have
such a good boy.

00:08:52.302 --> 00:08:53.355
You're crazy!

00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:55.288
Hey, how about it?

00:08:56.034 --> 00:08:57.658
Sai Yuk, did you
hear what he said?

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:58.931
Knock him out!

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.117
But why?

00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:02.664
Because of what he said.
Let's beat him up right now.

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.781
- Mmm!
- Don't try it.

00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:07.668
I'll do it!

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:08.678
Think so?

00:09:08.986 --> 00:09:10.829
Hey, stop it now!
Come on!

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.771
[Both] Hey!
Your dad's calling you!

00:09:14.517 --> 00:09:16.230
See that?
Your father wants you.

00:09:16.317 --> 00:09:17.371
Go on.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.962
There.

00:09:20.049 --> 00:09:21.454
I'll come back again.
You'll see.

00:09:21.673 --> 00:09:22.727
See you then.

00:09:22.991 --> 00:09:25.845
- Let's go.
- [Shouting]

00:09:29.445 --> 00:09:30.498
Go!

00:09:33.132 --> 00:09:34.406
They're good.

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:43.143
[Clapping]

00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:02.811
[Chan]
Watch out! Reverend!

00:10:06.324 --> 00:10:10.011
Aah!

00:10:12.338 --> 00:10:13.392
Someone, please!

00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:18.309
What happened?
I'll go see!

00:10:23.094 --> 00:10:24.983
[Yelling]

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.515
All right.
Shall we do it?

00:11:15.998 --> 00:11:17.096
[Yelling]

00:12:24.927 --> 00:12:26.332
I'm just waiting.

00:12:28.527 --> 00:12:29.932
Aah!

00:12:53.156 --> 00:12:54.474
Hold it!

00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:57.196
It could be a trap!

00:12:57.635 --> 00:12:58.864
Save your strength.

00:12:59.304 --> 00:13:01.498
[Man] The meeting of
the Red Flower Society

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:02.991
will come to order.

00:13:03.078 --> 00:13:04.308
Congratulations.

00:13:04.396 --> 00:13:06.240
You men and women
have done well.

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:09.226
Now let's hear from
some of our members.

00:13:09.313 --> 00:13:10.674
Who has a report?

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.572
[Man] Mr. Chan, sir!

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.065
Our new fishing rights
agreement

00:13:15.152 --> 00:13:17.480
will take effect
at the start of the month.

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:19.411
[Clapping]

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.211
[Man 2] The brood mares
have given birth

00:13:21.298 --> 00:13:22.924
to three more colts!

00:13:23.143 --> 00:13:26.304
Ahh, it seems like
it's all good news, right?

00:13:26.524 --> 00:13:29.157
The society is doing
tremendously right now.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.670
The value of our property
in Shanghai

00:13:33.196 --> 00:13:35.304
has increased three times!

00:13:35.392 --> 00:13:37.587
[Clapping]

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.222
[Man] Sir,
all the good news

00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:41.583
calls for
a celebration!

00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:43.866
[Chan] I'm afraid not.

00:13:44.348 --> 00:13:46.544
Some of our neighbours
have been victims

00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:47.992
of the recent flooding.

00:13:48.387 --> 00:13:49.705
We will loan them
some money.

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.558
Wow. I could do
all that, right?

00:13:53.481 --> 00:13:55.938
No, you couldn't.
It'd be too much for you.

00:13:56.027 --> 00:13:58.836
What? Come on.
I'm up to it.

00:14:00.022 --> 00:14:02.788
Mr. Chan, will you honour us
by naming our baby?

00:14:03.578 --> 00:14:04.632
Yes, of course.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.905
Thank you, sir.

00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:10.032
He's a handsome boy.

00:14:10.295 --> 00:14:12.842
Why don't we name him
Sung Taian?

00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:16.530
I hope that he will give you
a lot of pleasure.

00:14:29.876 --> 00:14:30.974
Unh!

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.125
Don't kill her!

00:14:37.735 --> 00:14:39.360
She tried
to kill you, sir.

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:40.940
I had to do it.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.047
Why would Mrs. Leong--

00:14:45.023 --> 00:14:47.262
Look...
it's someone in a mask.

00:14:47.789 --> 00:14:48.798
Who could this be?

00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:51.565
Say, that woman
was with you.

00:14:51.872 --> 00:14:53.321
What happened
to Mrs. Leong?

00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:56.174
Hey, what are you
babbling about?

00:14:56.613 --> 00:14:59.160
Why don't we ask him some
questions about the woman?

00:15:00.477 --> 00:15:02.716
Sure. Who's behind it?

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.746
He's jealous because his father
didn't appoint him to lead us!

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:07.370
Aren't you, Mr. Yun?

00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:10.135
And so you've become obsessed
with murdering our leader!

00:15:10.224 --> 00:15:12.594
- That's a complete lie!
- Prove it! You're a traitor, too!

00:15:12.682 --> 00:15:15.272
- [Crying]
- Stop that!

00:15:15.887 --> 00:15:19.004
How can we expect to overthrow
the Manchus when we fight each other?

00:15:19.092 --> 00:15:20.453
We must stand united!

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.077
He can forget it.

00:15:22.561 --> 00:15:24.931
Well, what happens if
we don't come together?

00:15:25.194 --> 00:15:27.170
What? What difference
would it make?

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:30.112
The only good philosophy
would be to stay neutral.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.702
Oh, stay out of trouble,
is that what you're saying?

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.653
Exactly.
You said it. You said it.

00:15:36.742 --> 00:15:39.156
For those of you
who question my loyalty

00:15:39.244 --> 00:15:41.131
to the Red Flower Society,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.414
I will prove myself.

00:15:45.873 --> 00:15:47.058
Hey...

00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:53.029
So I see
you were fighting.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.103
Your father
was a loyal subject,

00:15:56.323 --> 00:16:00.932
and his son could not be
any less honourable.

00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:05.981
I promise that I will
search out this traitor scum

00:16:06.464 --> 00:16:07.693
and I will kill him!

00:16:08.045 --> 00:16:10.547
Father, what happened
with her now?

00:16:11.074 --> 00:16:13.049
- My son, go away.
- Hold on!

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:18.757
Son, you've seen
this woman?

00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:21.830
Yes, sir. Dad was
talking with her

00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:23.762
before the meeting
started.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:28.241
Well,
there you have it.

00:16:28.591 --> 00:16:29.776
You shut your face!

00:16:35.923 --> 00:16:38.163
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

00:16:39.304 --> 00:16:40.928
- He's your own son!
- Who are you?

00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:42.596
Who am I?

00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:45.713
Aw, are you saying
that you don't know me?

00:16:45.977 --> 00:16:48.524
Well, I am our leader's
favourite relative...

00:16:48.743 --> 00:16:50.763
known as Fong Sai Yuk!

00:16:51.728 --> 00:16:52.782
Do you know who I am?

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:55.065
Oh, yeah.
The boy beater.

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:56.383
Unh!

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.524
Down!

00:16:58.622 --> 00:16:59.894
What are you doing?

00:17:00.157 --> 00:17:02.002
Do you know who
Mr. Yun's father is?

00:17:02.265 --> 00:17:03.451
He's our former leader!

00:17:03.538 --> 00:17:05.294
Sir. But the little boy was--

00:17:05.383 --> 00:17:07.270
That will be enough!
Mr. Dong!

00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:09.114
Uh, why are you looking
at me like that?

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:11.442
Give Fong Sai Yuk
some of your knowledge.

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:12.714
Teach him
our commandments.

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:14.734
- With pleasure!
- Good.

00:17:15.042 --> 00:17:16.446
See that he learns well.

00:17:23.032 --> 00:17:25.358
[Dong] The commandments of
the Red Flower Society.

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:29.573
One. You will not steal
another person's property.

00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:32.427
Two. You will not covet
the property of another.

00:17:33.042 --> 00:17:36.158
Three. You will not covet
the wife of another man.

00:17:36.247 --> 00:17:38.223
Four. You will
always be truthful.

00:17:38.486 --> 00:17:41.384
Five. Honour our leader
in every way.

00:17:41.954 --> 00:17:44.281
Hey, are you getting it?
I'll start again.

00:17:45.027 --> 00:17:47.881
It's more like
the seven Taoist commands.

00:17:47.969 --> 00:17:49.988
Yeah, that's just
where he got it from,

00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:52.228
and Mr. Yun has
adapted it for us.

00:17:52.623 --> 00:17:53.984
Huh. I thought so.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.101
[Yun] I see
you're a slow learner.

00:17:59.867 --> 00:18:02.150
Today you insulted me...

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:04.345
and I'm not
about to forget it.

00:18:05.091 --> 00:18:08.033
It's time you learned
a more important lesson

00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:10.623
from one
who is your superior.

00:18:11.106 --> 00:18:13.872
Who? The one who
hits boys?

00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:15.891
I'd like to
see you handle

00:18:16.198 --> 00:18:18.702
someone
that hits back.

00:18:20.063 --> 00:18:21.555
How should
we settle this?

00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:25.374
Maybe your godfather
could come to your rescue.

00:18:25.594 --> 00:18:27.746
No! The book
of commandments

00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:31.170
says to settle this
a different way.

00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:33.585
Fighting.

00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:37.053
Are you ready to fight?

00:18:37.272 --> 00:18:38.326
Uh-oh.

00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:19.069
[Yun growls]

00:19:59.767 --> 00:20:01.567
[Yun growls]

00:20:12.543 --> 00:20:13.553
Enough!

00:20:13.772 --> 00:20:15.572
Fighting is not
for settling disputes

00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:17.109
within the society.

00:20:17.987 --> 00:20:19.304
We are a family!

00:20:19.655 --> 00:20:21.631
You should save it
for the Manchus!

00:20:21.718 --> 00:20:22.641
I'm sorry.

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:26.109
When someone insults
the Yun name...

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.544
I will fight.

00:20:30.983 --> 00:20:33.442
Be prepared
to do it again.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.290
The commandments
that you learned,

00:20:40.817 --> 00:20:42.134
did you understand them?

00:20:42.353 --> 00:20:43.451
Uncle, it wasn't me!

00:20:43.538 --> 00:20:45.075
That's enough!
Kneel!

00:20:46.832 --> 00:20:49.510
- Your reason?
- The boy! His own child!

00:20:49.597 --> 00:20:51.178
No one should hurt
a baby like that.

00:20:51.397 --> 00:20:53.681
You are sure
in your convictions.

00:20:54.032 --> 00:20:55.525
It's your actions

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.632
I'm concerned with
right now.

00:20:57.895 --> 00:21:00.486
But am I supposed
to just ignore it?

00:21:00.705 --> 00:21:03.647
Perhaps... yes.

00:21:04.832 --> 00:21:06.325
When it's necessary.

00:21:06.895 --> 00:21:08.695
You think too much
like your mother.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.715
Maybe you should
go home to her.

00:21:13.832 --> 00:21:15.589
So keep reading.

00:21:15.896 --> 00:21:17.476
I know he wants you
to learn it.

00:21:17.828 --> 00:21:19.671
Anyway,
this part's the hardest.

00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:21.076
Here.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.794
You know what?
He didn't have to do that.

00:21:37.452 --> 00:21:40.218
Maybe we ought to go and
visit with your mother.

00:21:40.657 --> 00:21:41.798
What?

00:21:42.502 --> 00:21:45.135
Well, why wouldn't we?

00:21:46.453 --> 00:21:48.209
I'll tell you all
one thing--

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:49.789
one of these days...

00:21:50.843 --> 00:21:52.950
I'll do it. Really.

00:21:53.522 --> 00:21:56.550
I'll be... the leader!

00:21:59.097 --> 00:22:00.985
Hey, come on!
Come on!

00:22:01.072 --> 00:22:02.170
Yeah.

00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:05.770
Soup. Soup always
has to be made

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:07.790
with only
the best vegetables.

00:22:07.877 --> 00:22:09.634
Madam, someone's here
to see you.

00:22:15.297 --> 00:22:17.536
What's this,
a birthday party?

00:22:17.624 --> 00:22:19.381
Tell me, where's Sai Yuk?

00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:20.610
Why?

00:22:20.829 --> 00:22:23.464
From the Yangtze
to the Kowloon Harbour,

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.220
I've fought them all

00:22:25.307 --> 00:22:27.195
and they call me
the Duke of Hell!

00:22:27.547 --> 00:22:28.688
Duke of Hell?

00:22:29.127 --> 00:22:31.542
I'll show you some hell.
Pbblt!

00:22:36.503 --> 00:22:37.732
Fong Sai Yuk's mother.

00:22:38.434 --> 00:22:40.103
Now, get the hell
out of my sight.

00:22:40.323 --> 00:22:41.551
Where's she going?

00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:43.527
Hey, stop her.

00:22:43.615 --> 00:22:45.415
There's just one more thing
I've got to say.

00:22:45.678 --> 00:22:48.093
- Yeah?
- Watch this. Bite me!

00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:51.782
[Yelling]

00:22:56.435 --> 00:22:57.884
Well, how'd you
like that one?

00:22:58.498 --> 00:23:01.308
Madam Fong,
that was a real good one.

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:02.757
Oh, my soup.

00:23:03.372 --> 00:23:04.426
Oh, my.

00:23:04.996 --> 00:23:06.884
Is that for
Master Fong Sai Yuk?

00:23:07.235 --> 00:23:09.430
You bet it is.
See you later.

00:23:11.976 --> 00:23:13.821
I miss my master so!

00:23:14.435 --> 00:23:16.280
Sai Yuk!

00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:46.266
My good sir, I wonder if
you might be able to help me.

00:23:46.661 --> 00:23:48.066
I'm all out of water.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.216
Ahh.

00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:57.285
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.251
"On the first of the month,

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.675
a band of Japanese samurai
will travel nearby.

00:24:11.862 --> 00:24:14.275
They will have
the sacred box

00:24:14.364 --> 00:24:15.988
in which your secret
is hidden."

00:24:19.325 --> 00:24:20.466
Mr. Lin!

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.871
Yes, sir!

00:24:22.266 --> 00:24:23.276
[Chan] Mr. Wong!

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:24.769
Here, sir!

00:24:32.978 --> 00:24:34.515
[Dong] I hope he doesn't
want me to go.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.828
- Mr. Dong.
- I don't think I'm ready yet.

00:24:40.091 --> 00:24:42.330
Take someone on the mission
who is more prepared.

00:24:42.418 --> 00:24:43.472
Calm down.

00:24:43.735 --> 00:24:46.808
Better to name a good fighter
to go on this mission.

00:24:47.335 --> 00:24:48.608
That won't be you.

00:24:49.135 --> 00:24:50.672
Who would be
your choice?

00:24:51.462 --> 00:24:54.315
Ha ha!
I say we take Sai Yuk

00:24:54.404 --> 00:24:55.941
because he's always ready.

00:24:56.687 --> 00:24:58.706
That's what I think anyway.

00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:00.506
Fong Sai Yuk!

00:25:00.594 --> 00:25:01.911
Yo! Yes, sir!

00:25:02.263 --> 00:25:03.360
[Dong] Go, Sai Yuk!

00:25:05.687 --> 00:25:08.585
The mission is yours.
Do you accept it?

00:25:09.067 --> 00:25:09.989
I do!

00:25:10.077 --> 00:25:11.965
Some of you
may not come back.

00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:15.872
[All] Huh! All of us
are prepared to die!

00:25:16.355 --> 00:25:18.244
[Chan] Bring back
the sacred box!

00:25:25.663 --> 00:25:27.287
The numbers four and nine.

00:25:27.594 --> 00:25:30.668
Four and nine?
[Laughs]

00:25:30.755 --> 00:25:33.609
[Laughing]

00:25:33.829 --> 00:25:35.497
What is so damn funny?

00:25:35.585 --> 00:25:36.770
Well,
they were laughing.

00:25:37.034 --> 00:25:39.142
Because you've got
the loser's hand.

00:25:39.361 --> 00:25:41.029
- In mahjong?
- Roulette.

00:25:41.117 --> 00:25:42.258
I don't play it.

00:25:42.522 --> 00:25:44.497
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Remember now?

00:25:44.717 --> 00:25:46.561
Oh, yeah. Number six,
I shall not steal.

00:25:46.649 --> 00:25:49.107
Besides that.
You shall bring my girlfriend something.

00:25:49.327 --> 00:25:50.512
I won't forget.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.401
Bye. Good luck.

00:25:53.454 --> 00:25:55.693
Hyah!

00:25:58.371 --> 00:25:59.688
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:26:00.742 --> 00:26:03.552
Hold on. Let's be certain
that you're safe.

00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:06.362
Take this. It's good luck.

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:07.678
Yeah, you're right.

00:26:07.767 --> 00:26:09.567
We can't just
sit here all day.

00:26:10.006 --> 00:26:11.323
We're on a mission.

00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:13.913
Why are we waiting, then?
Good-bye.

00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:18.040
Stay safe, all right?
Bye-bye!

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.674
Hyah! Hyah!

00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:31.826
Ah, hello!
It's Mama Fong!

00:26:32.221 --> 00:26:33.626
Lei Ling!

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.523
What brings you
here today?

00:26:36.743 --> 00:26:38.235
Go on. Go on.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.035
- My stable.
- [Man] Yes, miss.

00:26:40.124 --> 00:26:41.089
So, what's the occasion?

00:26:41.177 --> 00:26:42.538
I brought soup
for Sai Yuk.

00:26:42.626 --> 00:26:43.635
He's on a mission!

00:26:43.724 --> 00:26:46.402
Right now? But I made
some soup for him.

00:26:46.841 --> 00:26:49.870
I can't believe you brought
his favourite soup all this way.

00:26:50.177 --> 00:26:51.977
Mmm. Looks good.

00:27:05.192 --> 00:27:06.158
What's the matter?

00:27:06.773 --> 00:27:08.441
[Sai Yuk]
Quiet! Hear that?

00:27:35.617 --> 00:27:37.154
[Sai Yuk]
It's the samurai!

00:27:39.173 --> 00:27:41.017
[Man] That woman's
in trouble.

00:27:42.642 --> 00:27:45.012
Wait. I've seen
that woman before.

00:27:48.656 --> 00:27:50.193
Hey, there, miss!

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.784
What are you doing?
Get away!

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:54.145
Hello, Sai.

00:27:54.452 --> 00:27:55.374
You know me?

00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:58.315
[Man] The sacred box!

00:27:59.676 --> 00:28:01.432
[Yelling]

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.487
[Yelling]

00:28:49.287 --> 00:28:50.912
They used nerve blocking
to paralyse you,

00:28:51.175 --> 00:28:52.229
but I can undo it.

00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:57.673
Hey! I'm still paralysed
from the waist down!

00:28:58.112 --> 00:28:59.342
Oh.

00:29:03.907 --> 00:29:05.092
I'm sorry.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.244
Go on.

00:29:09.483 --> 00:29:10.844
I'm not sure how.

00:29:17.386 --> 00:29:19.142
I'll carry you.
Come on.

00:29:19.362 --> 00:29:20.415
Oh!

00:30:06.074 --> 00:30:07.085
[Samurai] Get them!

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:08.226
Go!

00:30:17.402 --> 00:30:19.246
[gasps]

00:30:29.607 --> 00:30:31.846
Yaah!

00:31:07.188 --> 00:31:09.295
[Samurai] I'm going
to paralyse you!

00:31:11.228 --> 00:31:12.721
Get them!

00:31:42.135 --> 00:31:43.145
Matsuhiro!

00:31:43.716 --> 00:31:45.033
Matsuhiro?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.492
It's your mother.

00:31:48.018 --> 00:31:50.302
Ma! The box,
right there.

00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:52.014
We need it.

00:32:05.448 --> 00:32:06.853
Yes, sir.

00:32:29.683 --> 00:32:30.781
Still here?

00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:32.142
Still here!

00:32:38.376 --> 00:32:39.912
I'll take that box now.

00:32:52.074 --> 00:32:53.260
All my nerves
are blocked.

00:32:53.347 --> 00:32:54.621
Can she do
anything?

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.782
Hmm? Oh, no.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.362
No?

00:32:59.582 --> 00:33:00.854
I wouldn't know how.

00:33:00.943 --> 00:33:02.128
Oh, come on.

00:33:08.933 --> 00:33:10.118
Hey, he'll do.

00:33:10.513 --> 00:33:12.796
[Buzzing]

00:33:15.826 --> 00:33:16.880
Ai!

00:33:18.065 --> 00:33:21.137
Now, try to get it
into a good position.

00:33:21.357 --> 00:33:24.343
Look out. Now blow it
at me hard.

00:33:29.831 --> 00:33:31.543
I keep missing.
You do it.

00:33:34.046 --> 00:33:37.953
Your technique needs work.
It's too high.

00:33:40.587 --> 00:33:41.948
[Gulp]

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.890
It's so--

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:47.655
I missed, huh?

00:33:48.797 --> 00:33:50.509
Sorry. Is it bad?

00:33:50.729 --> 00:33:55.120
Ugh. Tastes like
you'd expect it to taste.

00:33:55.822 --> 00:33:58.675
Hey, watch. It's going
to get interesting.

00:33:59.597 --> 00:34:01.090
Ohh!

00:34:14.173 --> 00:34:15.447
That did it. Let's go.

00:34:18.871 --> 00:34:19.881
- What are you looking at?
- Me?

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:21.197
Yeah, you.

00:34:21.462 --> 00:34:23.262
Wait. There's something
you can show me.

00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:25.369
All right, I'd be happy to.
What is it?

00:34:25.895 --> 00:34:28.223
Well, how do you
unparalyse the legs?

00:34:28.573 --> 00:34:30.154
Just hit him
in the stomach.

00:34:31.208 --> 00:34:32.393
Oh.

00:34:51.667 --> 00:34:54.169
[Yun] That Fong Sai Yuck!

00:34:59.833 --> 00:35:01.150
It's Fong Sai Yuk.

00:35:02.335 --> 00:35:05.013
Listen, son,
let me do the talking. Me.

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:06.331
But, Mum, you can't.

00:35:07.604 --> 00:35:08.526
There he goes!

00:35:08.613 --> 00:35:10.238
Following his mother
around again!

00:35:10.326 --> 00:35:12.257
[Laughter]

00:35:12.916 --> 00:35:16.604
I know.
Always her little dog.

00:35:17.218 --> 00:35:18.711
He follows her.

00:35:20.116 --> 00:35:22.663
If you have something to say,
then say it out loud,

00:35:22.926 --> 00:35:24.244
or keep your mouth shut.

00:35:24.638 --> 00:35:26.438
Look at you all
sitting here,

00:35:26.526 --> 00:35:29.381
stuffing your faces while
my son is out risking his neck

00:35:29.468 --> 00:35:31.136
for the Red Flower Society.

00:35:31.224 --> 00:35:34.605
If any of you had an ounce of bravery,
instead of sitting here,

00:35:34.692 --> 00:35:36.844
you'd be out doing
something about it.

00:35:36.931 --> 00:35:39.127
But all I see
are six or seven men

00:35:39.214 --> 00:35:41.849
who, I must say, haven't
shown me a damn thing!

00:35:42.068 --> 00:35:43.385
Shut up!

00:35:43.781 --> 00:35:45.053
On this mission,

00:35:45.273 --> 00:35:48.917
why was it only your son
who returned unharmed?

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:51.201
What of it?

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.240
Does your mother
fight your battles?

00:35:56.908 --> 00:35:58.181
So!

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.693
Simple...

00:36:01.781 --> 00:36:03.537
he fights better
than most of them.

00:36:04.503 --> 00:36:05.469
Understand?

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:12.756
You want me?
Let's do it, then.

00:36:13.152 --> 00:36:15.128
Only remember
who started it.

00:36:15.478 --> 00:36:17.498
You don't have to fight
this fool for me.

00:36:17.586 --> 00:36:19.167
For once shut your mouth!

00:36:20.176 --> 00:36:21.054
I'm sick of it!

00:36:21.143 --> 00:36:24.172
Mr. Yun...
I'll take care of it.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.280
- Uh-huh.
- Mr. Chan,

00:36:26.367 --> 00:36:28.211
if I might possibly have
a word with you?

00:36:28.298 --> 00:36:29.791
I'm Mrs. Fong.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.680
Yes. You're
Sai Yuk's mum.

00:36:32.865 --> 00:36:35.323
That's it?
The boy's mum?

00:36:35.718 --> 00:36:39.098
Mr. Chan, all of Han Mei
knows my reputation.

00:36:39.187 --> 00:36:40.724
Don't tell me
you don't know me.

00:36:40.811 --> 00:36:42.480
About all the fights
that I've won?

00:36:42.787 --> 00:36:44.148
Please tell me
you know me.

00:36:44.674 --> 00:36:47.046
You must be joking.
Can't be.

00:36:47.441 --> 00:36:48.846
Son, let's get out
of this house.

00:36:48.933 --> 00:36:50.646
I'm being toyed with.
Good day.

00:36:50.733 --> 00:36:52.446
We have a duty
to the Red Flower.

00:36:52.665 --> 00:36:54.289
Stay here then.
I'll go.

00:36:55.035 --> 00:36:56.089
Hmm?

00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:59.997
I think I've changed
my mind.

00:37:00.261 --> 00:37:02.236
If you happen to be
looking for me,

00:37:02.324 --> 00:37:03.377
I'll be here.

00:37:03.465 --> 00:37:05.529
[Thunder rumbling]

00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:23.003
It's pouring.
You shouldn't be out.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:24.451
I have come to visit.

00:37:26.383 --> 00:37:27.656
Ohh!

00:37:28.358 --> 00:37:29.588
Aah!

[Groaning]

00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:33.978
I've brought some presents.
A few trinkets...

00:37:34.066 --> 00:37:37.051
and some Japanese sakémoto.

00:37:37.358 --> 00:37:39.730
Stronger than wine.
Let me help.

00:37:39.817 --> 00:37:42.145
No, wait, no, wait. I'm not sure
I'm up to it.

00:37:42.584 --> 00:37:44.208
I haven't seen this before.

00:37:44.778 --> 00:37:46.578
Oh, well,
guess it's all mine.

00:37:46.886 --> 00:37:49.432
But it's immoral!
Listen to what I'm saying!

drink that in here!

Please!
I'm begging--Aah!

00:37:57.247 --> 00:37:58.476
That's right.

00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:01.945
You'd better help me...

00:38:02.911 --> 00:38:04.447
or I might get drunk.

00:38:05.326 --> 00:38:06.993
But it's sakémoto!

00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:08.837
We'll both end up drunk

00:38:09.101 --> 00:38:11.033
and you don't want--
Ohh!

Don't tell me
you're shy.

00:38:27.057 --> 00:38:28.770
You're afraid
it will...

00:38:29.472 --> 00:38:32.985
go too far?

[Giggles]

00:38:37.243 --> 00:38:40.492
What have I done
to deserve this?!

I'd seen the last of her

so many years ago!

to stop me.

around to see us.

Perhaps if we shared
it once more?

No! Why do you tempt me

Damn fool!

00:39:29.049 --> 00:39:31.201
There's something
about sake.

00:39:32.167 --> 00:39:33.528
The more you drink...

00:39:34.274 --> 00:39:36.117
the more you want.

00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:40.947
All right, then. You have
to do something for me.

00:39:41.035 --> 00:39:42.265
- Huh?
- You...

00:39:42.352 --> 00:39:44.635
Just a minute now.

00:39:44.723 --> 00:39:48.543
I'm not interested
in prostituting myself.

00:39:48.762 --> 00:39:50.913
I'm sure I'll survive
without that.

00:39:51.133 --> 00:39:54.294
Listen, I want you to teach me
the fatal nerve block.

00:39:54.513 --> 00:39:57.323
Shh.

00:39:57.411 --> 00:39:59.518
Shh. Shh.

00:39:59.913 --> 00:40:01.933
But that's
a secret move.

00:40:02.285 --> 00:40:04.085
It won't be
imparted now.

00:40:04.172 --> 00:40:05.489
Maybe you should
hear me out.

00:40:06.016 --> 00:40:08.080
Fong Sai Yuk is the one
who needs to learn it.

00:40:08.167 --> 00:40:10.011
I want you
to show it to him.

00:40:11.372 --> 00:40:13.480
What for?
I mean, why?

00:40:13.568 --> 00:40:14.753
Why do you think?

00:40:14.841 --> 00:40:16.465
So the rest of them
who know it

00:40:16.772 --> 00:40:19.890
won't be able to take advantage
of him so much anymore.

00:40:20.592 --> 00:40:21.646
[Snoring]

00:40:21.733 --> 00:40:22.787
Ooh!

00:40:23.665 --> 00:40:26.255
[Rooster Crows]

00:40:26.914 --> 00:40:29.636
[Grunting]

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.164
Hey!

00:40:39.866 --> 00:40:41.095
Keep quiet about it.

00:40:41.314 --> 00:40:42.588
Oh, shut up.

00:40:43.729 --> 00:40:46.012
Ever try good manners?

00:40:46.714 --> 00:40:47.812
Old bat.

00:40:55.188 --> 00:40:56.373
Good morning.

00:40:56.462 --> 00:40:58.569
Lei Ling. Did you
sleep all right?

00:40:59.842 --> 00:41:00.895
What are you
wearing?

00:41:02.784 --> 00:41:04.232
I was
practising.

00:41:07.788 --> 00:41:09.237
Hey, I have a question.

00:41:09.632 --> 00:41:14.067
If a married woman
were to, um, to...

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:15.867
s-sleep with someone,

00:41:15.954 --> 00:41:18.369
a person to whom
she wasn't married,

00:41:18.456 --> 00:41:21.486
but the two of them
were doing it,

00:41:21.925 --> 00:41:24.604
doing it,
well, you know.

00:41:24.823 --> 00:41:26.184
You know what
they were doing.

00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:28.204
Do you think
there's anything wrong?

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:31.628
Mum, what?
Something so low?

00:41:33.384 --> 00:41:36.676
There's not even a good word
for what she's doing.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.233
I mean, I just think
sleeping around like that

00:41:40.321 --> 00:41:41.682
can't be forgiven.

00:41:41.989 --> 00:41:43.657
I mean,
what kind of woman

00:41:43.745 --> 00:41:45.765
would carry on
like that?

00:41:46.028 --> 00:41:47.653
You know very well
that it's wrong.

00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:49.716
Now, what kind of woman
could this person be,

00:41:49.804 --> 00:41:52.131
sleeping with a man
she isn't married to?

00:41:52.394 --> 00:41:53.800
What was she thinking?

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:56.346
The whole town should--
they should just destroy

00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:57.794
this little whore
as an example

00:41:58.057 --> 00:41:59.594
so it won't
happen again.

00:42:00.209 --> 00:42:02.272
So, now that
we've settled that,

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.424
do you want to go
to the market today?

00:42:05.566 --> 00:42:06.620
Lei Ling?

00:42:07.014 --> 00:42:08.244
Lei Ling?

00:42:20.888 --> 00:42:22.117
Hey!

00:42:23.346 --> 00:42:25.410
What are you doing?
I'm all naked!

00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:28.571
You should have kept
your clothes on last night.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:30.414
This is what you did!

00:42:30.942 --> 00:42:32.873
[Gasps]
She's pregnant!

00:42:34.762 --> 00:42:37.351
Wait!
It's not possible!

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:41.742
Damn it! Get out
of there right now!

00:42:42.093 --> 00:42:45.078
Let me show you what I do to
guys who take advantage of me

00:42:45.166 --> 00:42:47.581
while I'm sleeping,
you lousy little pig!

00:42:47.669 --> 00:42:49.952
- I oughta cut you a new--
- Hey, put that thing away!

00:42:50.171 --> 00:42:53.684
Not until I'm finished!
I'll make you pay for this!

00:42:53.947 --> 00:42:55.395
Aah!

00:42:58.206 --> 00:42:59.347
Listen, think about it!

00:42:59.654 --> 00:43:00.752
Even if something happened,

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.254
it's not possible for you
to get that big so soon!

00:43:03.343 --> 00:43:04.352
Sure,
that's what you say.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.240
It's got to be
something else.

00:43:06.328 --> 00:43:08.084
There's no way
something like that

00:43:08.172 --> 00:43:09.445
can happen overnight!

00:43:09.533 --> 00:43:11.860
I've heard the same story
a lot of times before!

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.055
You set me up to have
your way with me!

00:43:14.274 --> 00:43:16.426
No, listen, it's got
to be something else!

00:43:16.513 --> 00:43:17.698
Like what?

00:43:17.787 --> 00:43:20.421
I can tell you what it is
by taking your pulse!

00:43:20.509 --> 00:43:21.870
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:43:22.265 --> 00:43:24.592
Gas!
When you're drunk,

00:43:25.074 --> 00:43:26.304
you get gas!

00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:28.807
Ohh!

00:43:34.426 --> 00:43:36.841
[Mandarin] The samurai
have brought me the box...

00:43:40.046 --> 00:43:42.768
so I want all of you
to guard it well.

00:43:42.855 --> 00:43:43.822
Yes, sir!

00:43:43.909 --> 00:43:47.158
[Humming]

00:43:49.441 --> 00:43:50.670
[laughs]

00:43:51.416 --> 00:43:52.822
Sho Soo Li.

00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:56.773
Sho Soo Li!

00:43:57.036 --> 00:43:58.177
Yes, Father.

00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:00.549
What are you
daydreaming about?

00:44:01.427 --> 00:44:02.436
A boy.

00:44:02.744 --> 00:44:04.017
[Mandarin]
Well, that's enough.

00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:07.836
We failed in our attempt
this time.

00:44:08.495 --> 00:44:09.901
Now the leader's ready.

00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:12.140
Fong is a problem.

00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:14.203
But we can still do it.

00:44:14.642 --> 00:44:16.881
Sir, but now
we're under suspicion.

00:44:17.101 --> 00:44:18.505
So what?

00:44:18.988 --> 00:44:21.051
If we're under suspicion,

00:44:21.403 --> 00:44:23.949
I have information
that there's a secret

00:44:24.037 --> 00:44:25.881
about Mr. Chan

00:44:25.969 --> 00:44:28.691
in the container
that the samurai brought

00:44:28.778 --> 00:44:29.921
to the mandarin.

00:44:30.008 --> 00:44:31.062
We'll get it.

00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:33.301
[Chan] I'm concerned
that someone may

00:44:33.388 --> 00:44:35.276
try to steal
the sacred box.

00:44:36.154 --> 00:44:37.296
If that should happen,

00:44:37.515 --> 00:44:40.413
then I'm afraid
my chances of ruling

00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:41.554
will be gone.

00:44:41.643 --> 00:44:43.662
Master, the mandarin's daughter

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.593
seems to be fond
of Sai Yuk.

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.130
Why not send him
after it?

00:44:47.613 --> 00:44:48.974
I don't think so.

00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:51.828
It's too dangerous
for him.

00:44:53.321 --> 00:44:55.648
But, sir,
please think about it.

00:44:56.043 --> 00:44:58.326
The mandarin's daughter
would know

00:44:58.413 --> 00:45:01.091
exactly where her father's
secrets are kept.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.980
Don't you agree
with that?

00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:05.746
You see, sir,
I've composed a letter.

00:45:05.965 --> 00:45:07.413
[Sai Yuk]
Are you here, Godfather?

00:45:10.004 --> 00:45:11.057
Sai Yuk, what is it?

00:45:11.146 --> 00:45:12.463
My mother made some soup.

00:45:12.682 --> 00:45:14.438
[Chan] I have another
assignment for you.

00:45:14.702 --> 00:45:17.731
- Yes?
- Listen, the box was located.

00:45:17.818 --> 00:45:18.741
Good, then.

00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:21.418
That shows that
anything can be done.

00:45:21.507 --> 00:45:22.561
Precisely.

00:45:22.648 --> 00:45:24.053
Except
it isn't finished.

00:45:24.141 --> 00:45:26.072
Right.
What's the mission?

00:45:26.555 --> 00:45:27.697
Here.

00:45:27.785 --> 00:45:28.794
Take a look.

00:45:32.922 --> 00:45:34.985
This is a love letter
from me.

00:45:35.073 --> 00:45:36.522
Uh, yes.

00:45:36.609 --> 00:45:38.673
This is just how you begin
your assignment--

00:45:38.981 --> 00:45:40.210
Talking to a woman

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:43.414
and thereby establishing
some kind of way

00:45:43.503 --> 00:45:45.566
to win her trust,
so she'll help us.

00:45:45.653 --> 00:45:46.707
Understand?

00:45:47.542 --> 00:45:49.825
But, wait. No, no, no.
No, no, no.

00:45:49.912 --> 00:45:51.975
But what--what if my wife
finds out about it?

00:45:52.064 --> 00:45:53.864
Hey, now, don't you
worry about it.

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:55.401
I mean, who's going
to tell her?

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.112
I suppose.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.317
But should I pretend
that I'm in love?

00:46:01.064 --> 00:46:02.162
It's up to you.

00:46:02.249 --> 00:46:03.962
I just want you
to get close to her.

00:46:04.401 --> 00:46:05.893
And have sex with her?

00:46:06.112 --> 00:46:07.298
No sex.

00:46:07.869 --> 00:46:09.449
You get my box.

00:46:09.713 --> 00:46:11.206
You're going
to the Mandarin Palace.

00:46:11.513 --> 00:46:12.567
That's where
you'll meet her.

00:46:12.786 --> 00:46:15.508
Is this girl someone
that I've seen yet?

00:46:15.728 --> 00:46:16.913
Yes.

00:46:17.001 --> 00:46:19.635
You will recognise her
when you see her face.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.225
I hope she won't want
to get married.

00:46:22.796 --> 00:46:24.860
- That would be a disaster.
- [Yun] Mr. Chan,

00:46:25.606 --> 00:46:27.757
what about me, sir?

00:46:29.776 --> 00:46:31.269
I'll volunteer to go.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.245
Yeah.

00:46:33.815 --> 00:46:35.176
He could take my place.

00:46:35.572 --> 00:46:37.241
But you're not
a ladies' man. Ow!

00:46:38.337 --> 00:46:39.567
Listen!

00:46:39.787 --> 00:46:41.718
He failed on
the previous mission.

00:46:42.772 --> 00:46:44.396
Now it's my turn to try.

00:46:44.792 --> 00:46:47.031
But your father worked
against the mandarin.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.007
They wouldn't let you in
without a fight.

00:46:49.489 --> 00:46:51.333
Sai Yuk isn't known
to them at all.

00:46:52.255 --> 00:46:53.396
Yes...

00:46:53.792 --> 00:46:55.109
and she really likes him.

00:46:55.196 --> 00:46:56.426
We'll see.

00:46:56.733 --> 00:46:58.314
We'll see.

00:46:58.402 --> 00:46:59.763
I just might succeed.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.211
You betting on it?

00:47:01.475 --> 00:47:03.363
Certainly. Why don't
we set a wager?

00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:05.163
What is your bet?

00:47:05.558 --> 00:47:07.226
If I lose,
I'll find a way

00:47:07.314 --> 00:47:08.587
to destroy my kung fu.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:10.255
All right, then.

00:47:11.968 --> 00:47:13.242
Don't be worried.

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:16.973
[Soo Li] "A chance meeting
along the riverbank

00:47:17.368 --> 00:47:20.529
and now I have
only fate to thank.

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.217
I long for a word, a glance, a look.

00:47:24.305 --> 00:47:26.807
I remain your servant,
Fong Sai Yuk."

00:47:28.871 --> 00:47:30.671
Oh, how wonderful!

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.973
[laughs]

00:47:53.369 --> 00:47:54.554
[gasps]

00:47:54.642 --> 00:47:55.784
Dad.

00:48:02.369 --> 00:48:04.696
A young man
wants to court me.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.945
I know that
you'll like him.

00:48:10.491 --> 00:48:12.423
So, who is
this young man?

00:48:12.906 --> 00:48:14.267
Is he a scoundrel?

00:48:14.355 --> 00:48:15.891
No. He's not.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.326
Well, then, if he wants
to court you,

00:48:20.765 --> 00:48:21.994
he'll have to
prove himself.

00:48:22.082 --> 00:48:23.267
Well, that's perfect.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.696
Mum, shouldn't I tell
Ting Ting?

00:48:31.785 --> 00:48:33.189
No. There she is.

00:48:33.496 --> 00:48:34.550
Hold this.

00:48:34.946 --> 00:48:36.350
Wait.
I don't want it.

00:48:36.438 --> 00:48:37.404
You hold it.

00:48:37.492 --> 00:48:38.765
All right.
Listen.

00:48:39.204 --> 00:48:40.872
Yeah?
What should I do?

00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:42.277
You should just
kiss her, that's what.

00:48:42.365 --> 00:48:43.507
Don't play shy.

00:48:43.594 --> 00:48:44.955
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

00:48:45.438 --> 00:48:47.107
Just go right over there
and give her one.

00:48:47.194 --> 00:48:48.468
- Right here?
- There she is.

00:48:48.687 --> 00:48:49.741
Okay, then.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.517
Let's get to it, hmm?

00:49:04.625 --> 00:49:07.829
You've come to me
at long last.

00:49:08.707 --> 00:49:10.858
- But we, uh--
- Are you scared?

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:12.001
Ma?

00:49:12.088 --> 00:49:13.625
I'll fix that.

00:49:14.371 --> 00:49:16.083
Come on.
Don't be afraid.

00:49:16.566 --> 00:49:17.883
You should've
kissed him.

00:49:18.936 --> 00:49:19.947
Hmmph!

00:49:21.703 --> 00:49:23.547
She wants you
all the more.

00:49:24.073 --> 00:49:25.171
What's the matter?

00:49:25.258 --> 00:49:26.356
Nothing.

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:29.430
You don't want to let
her get away now.

00:49:29.869 --> 00:49:31.142
Better go.

00:49:33.293 --> 00:49:34.654
All right. Unh!

00:49:35.752 --> 00:49:36.806
Ooh!

00:49:43.523 --> 00:49:44.665
That was easy.

00:49:45.367 --> 00:49:46.421
Oh!

00:49:46.684 --> 00:49:48.923
Mmm.

00:49:49.187 --> 00:49:51.645
What are you doing?
Go after her.

00:49:52.041 --> 00:49:53.708
What?
You mean...

00:49:54.543 --> 00:49:56.343
You kissed
one of the Buddhist nuns?

00:49:57.265 --> 00:49:59.724
Hey, it could be the first
kiss that she ever got.

00:49:59.811 --> 00:50:01.172
- Now come on.
- Okay.

00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:02.577
She might ask you
for more.

00:50:02.665 --> 00:50:04.202
Ahh! Ahh!

00:50:06.396 --> 00:50:07.977
I must've
scared her away.

00:50:08.065 --> 00:50:09.294
Maybe she doesn't
want me.

00:50:09.382 --> 00:50:11.402
- Oh, stop it.
- Stop what?

00:50:11.489 --> 00:50:12.543
[Soo Li] Sai Yuk,

00:50:12.631 --> 00:50:14.300
do you want to
marry me or not?

00:50:14.387 --> 00:50:16.889
Sure, I do, but there's
one condition.

00:50:17.196 --> 00:50:18.338
Well, what is it?

00:50:18.426 --> 00:50:19.480
That box you have.

00:50:19.568 --> 00:50:21.455
All right.
I can get it somehow,

00:50:21.544 --> 00:50:23.080
but you'll also have
to prove yourself

00:50:23.168 --> 00:50:24.397
in a competition
you'll win,

00:50:24.661 --> 00:50:26.548
and you'll also
declare your love.

00:50:26.768 --> 00:50:28.085
- Deal.
- Bet on it.

00:50:59.608 --> 00:51:01.584
The competition
will soon start.

00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:05.578
The winner
will marry Sho Soo Li.

00:51:06.325 --> 00:51:09.003
The rules are simple,
so now listen.

00:51:09.662 --> 00:51:11.945
Whichever man
retrieves the flowered ball

00:51:12.032 --> 00:51:13.788
from the top
of the bridal sedan,

00:51:14.095 --> 00:51:15.808
I shall proclaim
the winner,

00:51:15.895 --> 00:51:18.047
and then he will also wed
my daughter.

00:51:19.232 --> 00:51:21.867
The true competition
will now begin.

00:51:22.262 --> 00:51:23.843
[Playing fanfare]

00:51:26.257 --> 00:51:28.057
[Crowd] Ohh.

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:31.043
Ooh, what
arresting beauty.

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:34.598
[Soo Li] Where is he?

00:51:37.935 --> 00:51:39.735
She'll make
a fine bride.

00:51:40.657 --> 00:51:41.667
Too bad.

00:51:42.018 --> 00:51:43.467
Too bad
she'll be mine.

00:51:43.818 --> 00:51:45.092
I'll win.

00:51:46.189 --> 00:51:47.463
She'll be
my wife

00:51:47.682 --> 00:51:49.000
once I'm
finished.

00:51:49.746 --> 00:51:52.248
Sorry, my friends,

00:51:52.994 --> 00:51:54.180
I'm going to win.

00:51:54.443 --> 00:51:55.761
Contestants, get ready.

00:51:56.068 --> 00:51:57.472
[Men grunt]

00:51:58.043 --> 00:51:59.009
And start!

00:51:59.096 --> 00:52:00.633
[Yelling]

00:52:45.415 --> 00:52:46.908
Kick them!

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.176
[Men Yelling]

00:53:28.924 --> 00:53:30.153
Mmm!

00:54:39.915 --> 00:54:42.417
I told you we'd be late
carrying this flagpole.

00:54:42.769 --> 00:54:45.008
Don't worry. These guys
can't keep us out.

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:46.940
[Both] What do you want?

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.180
- The girl.
- The kung fu contest.

00:54:49.267 --> 00:54:50.847
- He's too late.
- Am I?

00:54:54.052 --> 00:54:55.282
Hmm.

00:54:56.204 --> 00:54:57.169
Ohh! Aah!

00:54:57.257 --> 00:54:58.926
[Laughter]

00:55:04.106 --> 00:55:05.687
Aha! Oh!

00:55:19.033 --> 00:55:19.955
Ooh.

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:29.922
[Man] Hey!

00:55:33.653 --> 00:55:34.795
Hello.

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:38.131
- Huh?
- Hey, there.

00:55:41.775 --> 00:55:43.531
Aah!

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.903
[Crowd] Ohh!

00:55:50.556 --> 00:55:51.610
Yeah.

00:55:57.536 --> 00:55:58.634
About time
you made it.

00:55:58.723 --> 00:55:59.776
I'm sorry.

00:56:01.093 --> 00:56:02.058
Have you been waiting?

00:56:03.332 --> 00:56:04.737
So long.

00:56:05.045 --> 00:56:06.186
Bored yet?

00:56:07.986 --> 00:56:09.698
Hey, don't get thrown off.

00:56:12.464 --> 00:56:14.835
Well, men,
have a nice ride down.

00:56:29.587 --> 00:56:30.684
Are you ready?

00:56:30.772 --> 00:56:32.967
I was hoping you were
going to ask me that.

00:56:38.455 --> 00:56:39.509
All right.

00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:45.041
[All] Aah!

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.153
Good, huh?

00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:53.426
Wow.

00:56:53.689 --> 00:56:55.402
Just amazing. Huh?

00:57:00.933 --> 00:57:03.172
I know.
You want me to jump.

00:57:04.094 --> 00:57:06.861
Hai!

00:57:07.475 --> 00:57:08.441
- Whoo.
- Let's go.

00:57:10.681 --> 00:57:12.085
Thanks.

00:57:23.149 --> 00:57:24.290
What? Huh?

00:57:24.773 --> 00:57:26.661
- Hmm?
- What's the matter?

00:57:27.232 --> 00:57:28.549
Can't you look me in the eye?

00:57:28.636 --> 00:57:30.261
Ahh. Ready?

00:57:30.481 --> 00:57:31.973
Hey, wait.

00:57:32.236 --> 00:57:33.378
I'm shocked.

00:57:33.466 --> 00:57:34.432
Wait a minute.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.012
Come on.
Let me explain.

00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:37.462
Have you gone crazy?

00:57:37.769 --> 00:57:40.008
Didn't you think
I'd find out about this?

00:57:40.095 --> 00:57:42.642
- Well, yes, but there's more to this...
- I don't want to hear it.

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:43.915
...than there seems
to be right now.

00:57:44.003 --> 00:57:45.320
- I'm not going to listen.
- If you'd listen--

00:57:45.408 --> 00:57:46.462
I'm not!

00:57:47.778 --> 00:57:48.876
That might've hurt.

00:57:49.095 --> 00:57:50.281
How about this?

00:57:51.906 --> 00:57:53.134
[Crowd] Oh!

00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:56.735
Come on, settle down.

00:57:56.823 --> 00:57:57.789
I'm not done.

00:57:58.754 --> 00:58:00.028
Be sensible.

00:58:00.115 --> 00:58:01.125
I will not.

00:58:03.013 --> 00:58:04.506
Why is she bothering us?

00:58:06.218 --> 00:58:07.184
Uh--

00:58:07.272 --> 00:58:10.872
I'll tell you why.
I'm his wife.

00:58:11.882 --> 00:58:12.935
Don't believe it.

00:58:13.637 --> 00:58:15.569
Oh, two can play at that.

00:58:15.657 --> 00:58:17.063
All right.

00:58:17.676 --> 00:58:18.950
Wait!

00:58:31.946 --> 00:58:32.955
Creep!

00:58:40.726 --> 00:58:42.218
There must be
a better way.

[Straining]

00:58:52.316 --> 00:58:53.546
Let me at them.

00:59:01.142 --> 00:59:02.503
[Ting Ting] Ohh!

00:59:04.522 --> 00:59:05.751
Ma.

00:59:07.683 --> 00:59:08.736
You asked for it.

00:59:09.307 --> 00:59:10.801
Will you help me
break this up?

00:59:11.327 --> 00:59:12.601
- Who should I take?
- That one.

00:59:14.136 --> 00:59:15.322
- Li, come on.
- Ting Ting.

00:59:15.542 --> 00:59:17.342
- Please, stop fighting.
- Come on now.

00:59:18.615 --> 00:59:21.117
Listen, he's doing--
he doesn't love her.

00:59:21.205 --> 00:59:22.478
Well, I don't care.

00:59:22.566 --> 00:59:24.278
Someone should've mentioned
something to me.

00:59:24.366 --> 00:59:26.166
Hey, you wouldn't have
wanted him to do it.

00:59:26.254 --> 00:59:27.308
- Come on now, Li.
- Let me go.

00:59:27.395 --> 00:59:29.810
Let me go. I'll make you
into a slave.

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:31.347
Let me see you
try it.

00:59:31.742 --> 00:59:33.498
Come on now.
Please, please.

Let me go!
Let me go!

Hey, take it easy.

00:59:36.615 --> 00:59:38.767
The minute he realises
what kind of woman you are,

00:59:38.854 --> 00:59:40.610
he'll drop her
like an old habit.

00:59:40.698 --> 00:59:42.278
- Whoa now!
- Why?

00:59:42.367 --> 00:59:43.860
Well, it was
for Mr. Chan.

00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:46.230
All right. If you don't
care about her,

00:59:46.537 --> 00:59:48.293
- then go slap her.
- I will.

00:59:48.733 --> 00:59:49.787
Stop.

00:59:50.621 --> 00:59:52.069
You want that box?

00:59:53.167 --> 00:59:54.441
Huh?

00:59:54.528 --> 00:59:55.537
All right.
then I'll do it.

00:59:55.626 --> 00:59:56.591

away from Sai Yuk.

He loves me,
not you.

Just ask him
if you don't believe me.

01:00:05.898 --> 01:00:07.480
Unless you're afraid to.

Hmm?

Why won't you
look at me?

01:00:13.802 --> 01:00:16.875
- But--
- So, I'll jump, then.

Stop it. Why won't you
let me fall?

01:00:37.949 --> 01:00:40.188
[Strains] I won't.
You're my wife.

01:00:40.451 --> 01:00:42.207
I'm supposed to be
your only wife.

01:00:42.866 --> 01:00:45.149
Sai Yuk, save me!

01:00:46.071 --> 01:00:47.036
What?

01:00:52.656 --> 01:00:53.710
[Soo Li] So strong.

01:00:53.797 --> 01:00:55.334
Just like you are
in bed.

01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:56.651
Hmm. Ha ha!

01:00:57.003 --> 01:00:58.495
You took her to bed?

01:00:58.803 --> 01:01:01.173
All right. Let me loose,
and I'll fall, okay?

01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.017
What are you doing?

01:01:03.412 --> 01:01:04.686
She's making it up.

Let me go!

an old lady, huh?

01:01:09.647 --> 01:01:11.534
Aah!

Oh, boy. Uhh!

my new son-in-law.

I love you,

The outside world

01:02:54.093 --> 01:02:56.156

to the wedded couple.

in its tender embrace

01:03:02.917 --> 01:03:04.806

sweetness and laughter
as companions.

Whoops. Huh?

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:19.689

Lei Ling, I don't want
to hear that right now.

Shall I sing a song
instead?

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:28.294
I keep remembering

01:03:29.304 --> 01:03:32.509
Sai Yuk reciting
those words to me.

01:03:35.802 --> 01:03:37.646
What do you say?
Shall we?

01:03:38.392 --> 01:03:39.622
What's your hurry?

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.563
I'll keep my end
of the bargain

as long as you keep yours.

[Soo Li] What do you
really want?

01:03:47.744 --> 01:03:49.587
Me or what's in
your old box?

01:03:49.675 --> 01:03:51.958
What?
You know I want the box.

01:03:53.627 --> 01:03:54.636

to be in a rush.

you're going?

- To church.
- To eat.

Is that so?

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.491
You used deception on us.

to get what you wanted.

I'll take back the box

01:05:09.316 --> 01:05:10.809
you stole from her.

Is that what she said?
Now, how can that be?

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:15.243
Why don't you
ask her again?

01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:17.131
Enough of your fooling.

come from, huh?

the box.

then I die.

your own life?

rather see it burned?

Ah, you want me
to destroy it,

so no one
can learn the truth.

I must've been blind

not to see
such an ambitious man,

I don't think
you have the box at all.

01:11:41.637 --> 01:11:44.316
Would you listen to me?
All his nerve endings are intact.

01:11:44.404 --> 01:11:45.896
We can bring
his skill back.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.565
- Do you mean it?
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:50.946 --> 01:11:52.087
[Mother] Sai Yuk.

01:11:52.438 --> 01:11:53.492
Sai Yuk.

01:11:55.335 --> 01:11:56.346
Ma...

01:11:56.653 --> 01:11:58.014
make sure he gets it.

01:11:58.277 --> 01:11:59.902
Ah, so the box
showed up...

01:12:02.141 --> 01:12:04.818
and Mr. Chan is really
the emperor.

01:12:04.907 --> 01:12:05.961
Emperor?

01:12:06.838 --> 01:12:08.024
But that means trouble.

01:12:08.112 --> 01:12:09.780
I'll destroy it
as soon as possible.

01:12:09.868 --> 01:12:10.877
- Hey.
- What?

01:12:10.966 --> 01:12:12.985
Don't you dare destroy it.

01:12:13.073 --> 01:12:14.302
This will come in handy.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:16.542
[Woman] Li Dong,
open up. It's me.

01:12:19.044 --> 01:12:20.142
I came to warn you all.

01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:21.414
Yun and his men
are on the way.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:22.468
That's it.

01:12:22.907 --> 01:12:24.136
- Faster.
- All right. Now hurry.

01:12:24.225 --> 01:12:26.156
- Let's get out of here.
- We have to be faster.

01:12:30.107 --> 01:12:31.468
Unh.

01:12:35.464 --> 01:12:36.693
Have Fong read it.

01:12:37.264 --> 01:12:39.283
The book on nerve blocking.
Thank you.

01:12:39.371 --> 01:12:42.927
They're here. Make sure he reads it all.
Better get moving now. Go!

01:12:45.517 --> 01:12:47.406
- Come on!
- Over there!

01:12:47.493 --> 01:12:48.854
[Man] Surround the house!

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:54.474
Company, halt! Come out!

01:12:56.362 --> 01:12:58.469
Fong Sai Yuk,
your day has come.

01:13:01.323 --> 01:13:02.684
He won't be needed!

01:13:02.771 --> 01:13:05.318
[Laughing]

01:13:07.601 --> 01:13:08.567
You know what?

01:13:09.182 --> 01:13:10.982
This is your day to die!

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:12.913
I wouldn't be so sure
about it.

01:13:13.001 --> 01:13:14.143
Go get him!

01:13:33.504 --> 01:13:34.557
Not too bad, eh?

01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:36.270
Wait until you see
my nerve blocking.

01:13:37.983 --> 01:13:40.441
[Clucks]

01:14:05.246 --> 01:14:08.144
Aah!

01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:10.295
Here, why don't
you take him?

01:14:10.647 --> 01:14:11.788
I'm going back.

01:14:13.501 --> 01:14:14.466
Can you help him?

01:14:16.134 --> 01:14:18.242
- Please.
- I'll try. Who are you?

01:14:18.462 --> 01:14:19.866
We're getting married.

01:14:21.447 --> 01:14:23.291
Please,
take care of him.

01:14:24.432 --> 01:14:28.120
Where is he? Talk!

01:14:28.208 --> 01:14:29.349
Go to hell.

01:14:33.695 --> 01:14:35.408
Hey, are you all right?

01:14:35.978 --> 01:14:37.910
Find him outside, men!
Go get him!

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:50.467
Aah!

01:14:50.993 --> 01:14:52.926
Dong! Oh, my God!

01:14:53.013 --> 01:14:54.902
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:14:54.989 --> 01:14:56.306
[Groans]

01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:57.755
No.

01:14:58.237 --> 01:15:01.837
I must...
have been rusty.

01:15:02.145 --> 01:15:05.174
It's been a while
between fights.

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:07.106
[Groans]

01:15:09.126 --> 01:15:10.663
I should have...

01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:16.809
ohh, I should have
stayed out of it.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.916
[Groans]

01:15:19.575 --> 01:15:21.463
But you were so brave.

01:15:22.165 --> 01:15:23.263
You saved me.

01:15:25.194 --> 01:15:29.805
Th-that would be
the first time

01:15:30.507 --> 01:15:34.590
I've saved anyone
in a while.

01:15:35.468 --> 01:15:38.103
[Groans] Oh, God.

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:40.342
Keep my

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:45.127
memory alive.

01:15:46.181 --> 01:15:47.542
Please.

01:15:50.614 --> 01:15:51.801
Please.

01:15:54.873 --> 01:15:56.190
I promise.

01:15:59.483 --> 01:16:01.151
I won't forget.

01:16:02.556 --> 01:16:04.356
[Sobbing]

01:16:15.508 --> 01:16:18.493
[Footsteps]

01:16:23.806 --> 01:16:25.474
[Yun] I believe...

01:16:28.415 --> 01:16:31.357
this is what
you've been looking for.

01:16:32.937 --> 01:16:36.976
It tells me
a great deal about you...

01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:39.391
the would-be emperor.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:42.509
You are powerless
without your followers.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.143
We have laid waste to them.

01:16:46.196 --> 01:16:47.646
As I will to you!

01:16:51.992 --> 01:16:53.133
Not yet.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.216
Your fight with me is liable
to be your final fight.

01:16:57.304 --> 01:17:01.036
Well, do you suppose
I'd come without my men?

01:17:02.177 --> 01:17:03.670
Go ahead.

01:17:05.558 --> 01:17:07.138
See what happens
to your men.

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.333
- No. I can't.
- [Men] Kill him!

01:17:09.641 --> 01:17:11.924
Go ahead! What are you trying
to prove to us?

01:17:12.187 --> 01:17:14.120
Once again,
the leader is now Yun.

01:17:14.822 --> 01:17:16.227
You begin following me!

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.509
You have given me
no option.

01:17:19.212 --> 01:17:21.364
I will not
allow men to die.

01:17:21.977 --> 01:17:23.427
You have the advantage.

01:17:23.866 --> 01:17:26.456
I will not permit
any more suffering.

01:17:27.158 --> 01:17:30.671
So, now, our society
is at your disposal.

01:17:39.056 --> 01:17:42.437
Brethren, once again
the Yun family rules.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.905
It was all worthwhile.
Ha ha ha!

01:17:45.993 --> 01:17:47.617
All hail
the master!

01:17:47.706 --> 01:17:51.306
[All] Hail Master Yun!

01:17:52.974 --> 01:17:55.169
Mr. Yun, sir,
what about the woman?

01:17:55.652 --> 01:17:57.408
- Huh?
- There!

01:18:00.921 --> 01:18:02.457
[Groans]

01:18:02.852 --> 01:18:03.906
Ha ha ha!

01:18:04.169 --> 01:18:07.286
Ah, yes,
you always reminded me

01:18:07.813 --> 01:18:09.130
of a mother hen.

01:18:09.965 --> 01:18:13.433
Except that you look after
a flock of only one.

01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:16.155
Let's see now,
I have something for you,

01:18:16.243 --> 01:18:19.141
mother hen! Ha ha ha!

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.565
[Man] Get her!
Ha ha! Get her!

01:18:31.828 --> 01:18:34.726
You're nothing but
a meddling old woman!

01:18:36.657 --> 01:18:38.063
Ha ha ha!

01:18:47.809 --> 01:18:52.287
[Men Laughing]

01:18:54.877 --> 01:18:58.127
We'll see how many days

01:18:58.477 --> 01:19:01.903
you survive. Ha ha ha!

"The art of nerve blocking."

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.732
Here you are,
Sai Yuk.

01:19:43.874 --> 01:19:45.543
Have you heard
from my mother?

01:19:49.889 --> 01:19:53.708
But it's been a month.
That can't be.

01:19:55.465 --> 01:19:56.650
Who's there?

01:19:57.748 --> 01:19:59.943
I've come about
your godfather.

01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:01.698
They're holding him
prisoner.

01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:03.631
- And my mother?
- It's bad.

01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:06.485
She's barely surviving.

01:20:07.406 --> 01:20:08.987
They've hung her
in the square.

01:20:10.611 --> 01:20:12.324
Ma! Unh!

01:20:12.411 --> 01:20:14.431
Sai Yuk, you must rest.

01:20:14.650 --> 01:20:16.582
You can rely on the
others to help her now.

01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:19.700
No. The others
are mostly dead.

01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:22.465
Those that have survived

01:20:23.344 --> 01:20:25.670
are being held prisoner
with Mr. Chan.

01:20:26.285 --> 01:20:29.797
Our army does not
exist anymore.

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:32.563
There is no one left
to fight them, Mr. Fong.

that I want.

But first I want
to watch you suffer.

used to it. Now!

Show me what's left of
your kung fu skills!

01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:32.971
Ha ha ha!

01:29:33.586 --> 01:29:36.395
Come on. You can get up
and show him.

01:30:21.046 --> 01:30:22.890
- We'll beat him together.
- All right.

01:30:22.977 --> 01:30:23.987
I'll kill you both!

01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:40.890
- Do it now!
- Let's do it!

01:30:50.725 --> 01:30:51.953
He'll wear himself out.

01:30:56.432 --> 01:30:58.012
Aagh!

01:30:58.715 --> 01:30:59.988
Come on!

01:31:00.427 --> 01:31:01.569
Which one is
the fatal nerve?

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.369
On the spine!

01:31:04.378 --> 01:31:05.915
Aah!

01:31:07.276 --> 01:31:09.734
It's called the stone dragon,
and it works like this.

01:31:16.452 --> 01:31:17.901
That's it! Good!

01:31:17.989 --> 01:31:19.306
I guess I remembered!

01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:43.980
Hyah!

01:31:55.087 --> 01:31:56.535
All right!

01:31:59.257 --> 01:32:02.418
Aah!

01:32:04.877 --> 01:32:06.018
Mother!

01:32:06.107 --> 01:32:08.170
Oh, well,
that wasn't so bad, was it?

01:32:09.092 --> 01:32:11.287
[Both] Well, at least
you could thank us now.

01:32:11.375 --> 01:32:12.561
Thanks.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.229
What are you doing here?

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:16.820
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

01:32:16.907 --> 01:32:18.620
He shouldn't be sitting
up there like that.

01:32:18.707 --> 01:32:20.814
Oh, he won't be
bothering anybody.

01:32:21.034 --> 01:32:23.624
Well, thanks to us, right?
Let's go.

01:32:25.951 --> 01:32:27.005
Hmm?

01:32:28.146 --> 01:32:30.429
[Horses Neighing]

01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:35.040
[Men Shouting]

01:32:39.254 --> 01:32:40.747
The troops
are coming.

01:32:44.523 --> 01:32:46.366
- Get them!
- Open it up!

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:51.240
[Men Cheering]

01:32:51.854 --> 01:32:53.215
Sir!

01:32:54.752 --> 01:32:55.937
It's our side.

01:33:17.933 --> 01:33:19.865
Sai Yuk, why don't you
return with us?

01:33:20.084 --> 01:33:22.630
I can't. I've got to be
going my own way.

01:33:23.509 --> 01:33:25.528
Too bad. The society
will miss you.

01:33:25.748 --> 01:33:27.065
[Mother]
Don't worry, Mr. Chan.

01:33:27.152 --> 01:33:29.611
If you need his assistance
for anything,

01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.665
you'll have it.

01:33:30.753 --> 01:33:32.070
Thank you so much.

01:33:32.465 --> 01:33:35.670
It looks like you'll have
your hands full as it is.

01:33:35.757 --> 01:33:36.987
You said it.

01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:39.226
I want to give you
something nice.

01:33:39.314 --> 01:33:41.157
But I really want for you
to have my gift now.

01:33:41.596 --> 01:33:44.144
- Now!
- But listen, Sai Yuk's grandfather

01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:46.163
gave it to him when
he was just a boy.

01:33:46.251 --> 01:33:48.709
He told me the same thing
about this very one.

01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:52.002
How could the both
of us have--

01:33:52.705 --> 01:33:55.294
I have so many
of these things.

01:33:56.655 --> 01:33:58.763
I'd like you to take one.

01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:00.475
Aah!

01:34:02.012 --> 01:34:03.812
- You're very kind.
- Okay. How about you?

01:34:04.295 --> 01:34:06.929
Would you like one?
I've got about a million of 'em.

01:34:07.017 --> 01:34:08.817
We should try to
talk more often.

01:34:09.388 --> 01:34:10.705
[Both] Sai Yuk!

01:34:10.968 --> 01:34:13.164
Oh, my.
Well, see you later!

01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:14.832
[Both]
Sai Yuk, slow down!

01:34:17.378 --> 01:34:19.090
I guess I'll see you later.

01:34:20.012 --> 01:34:21.593
Ha ha! Best of luck!

01:34:22.251 --> 01:34:24.797
- [Sai Yuk] They're catching up.
- [Soo Li] What a cheap trinket!

01:34:25.017 --> 01:34:26.378
How many other girls
did you give them to?!

01:34:26.466 --> 01:34:27.740
[Ting Ting] I can't believe you gave us
the same present!

01:34:27.827 --> 01:34:29.320
[Mother] Ladies, wait!

01:34:29.408 --> 01:34:34.149
