00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.300
[Mother] The seed falls
and with time,

00:02:12.384 --> 00:02:15.387
is carried far from
the tree that bore it.

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:19.057
Yet the seed longs
to return...

00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:22.310
for the tree...

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:24.146
is filled with memories.

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:26.148
- Ma!
- Fong, save yourself!

00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:27.941
No way! You need
my protection!

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:36.283
[Mother]
Memories that are joyful

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:39.327
and memories
that are filled with pain.

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.455
Ooh, ow. It hurts.

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:43.874
It would have been worse
if I hadn't shielded you.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:45.292
Please, Dad, no!

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:50.589
I'm coming home! Yeah!

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:55.802
- Aah! Look out!
- Hey, you look great!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.721
Aah!

00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:02.059
[Mother]
He longs to return...

00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:04.603
no matter
how great the distance...

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:06.438
or how barren
the terrain...

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:10.442
because the memory is so strong
and lasting and clear.

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:16.656
Its images are glimpsed
through time's pallid veil...

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.284
like an apparition.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:20.911
Come on, come on!

00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:23.455
Coming unbidden,
a shadow--

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:25.791
Wait a minute. Unh!

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.711
A shadow,
a whispering wind,

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:31.088
calling his name.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.589
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.885
Ha ha! Hyah!

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:41.431
[Horse Neighs]

00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:44.142
[Parade Music]

00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:01.034
[Chan] Our people have
been looking forward

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:02.494
to this celebration.

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:05.539
Ha ha ha! Yes, good.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:08.917
[Cheering]

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:12.129
It pleases me to see them
enjoying themselves.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.297
Ahh. Sai Yuk.

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:16.925
Do you know how lucky
we both are?

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:18.468
This is the way
it should be.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.846
[Waiter] Go away!
We don't allow begging here!

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.431
- No! Go away!
- Sir, it's for the poor.

00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:26.143
- Don't you understand--
- I told you there's no begging here.

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.102
Now go away.

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:27.978
Hey! Can't you--

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.479
Hey, he's with me.

00:04:30.397 --> 00:04:32.315
- Bless you, my son.
- Sorry. I didn't know.

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:37.112
Aie!

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.905
Only a minute ago
you threw him out.

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:40.490
- Shall we?
- Fine.

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:43.994
Ow. My knees.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:51.459
What hit me?

00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:01.261
Reverend, there's plenty
to eat, so go on.

00:05:01.553 --> 00:05:03.221
Ah, bless you.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.932
Allow me the great honour

00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:08.143
of reading
your fortune tonight.

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.939
I foresee that you will lead
an extraordinary life.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.565
- Me?
- That's nothing.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.193
He already has
an extraordinary wife.

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.154
Yes, I'm sure.

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.073
You will bring him
happiness.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.410
I foresee that you
will have one boy child

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.619
and one girl.

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.830
- Isn't that wonderful?
- No more?

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:35.001
I predict a minimum
of two girls and two boys

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.169
for you, sir.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:37.504
That's great!

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.718
Wait, sir, do you mean
that I'll--

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:46.053
Yes, you comprehend.

00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:48.222
- But, uh...
- Mmm!

00:05:49.765 --> 00:05:51.016
Wait! Ting Ting!

00:05:51.308 --> 00:05:52.935
Reverend, help yourself.
I've got to go.

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:54.144
Ting Ting! Wait!

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:56.063
Wait! I'm not finished!

00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:58.522
Don't go away!

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:02.610
I'm afraid my godson
is always in such a big hurry.

00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:05.571
Sir, you beware.

00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:08.741
Your face is clouded
with evil.

00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:11.494
You're mistaken.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:14.080
No. It seems clear to me.

00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:16.623
Your palm.

00:06:17.332 --> 00:06:19.751
[Chuckles]
All right. Go on.

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:23.672
Emperor!

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:28.635
Good sir, why are you
calling me emperor?

00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:30.470
Because I saw it.

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:33.890
The markings on
your hand are those

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.851
that only one of
the royal line would have.

00:06:41.163 --> 00:06:44.176
[Woman] My son, it is no longer
safe for you here.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:46.098
You will go to Japan

00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:48.063
to live under
the protection of Mr. Yun,

00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:50.508
leader of
the Red Flower Society.

00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:53.304
Your new name
will be Chan Ka Lok.

00:06:53.697 --> 00:06:55.618
Inside of this sacred box

00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:58.676
are documents which prove
your true birthright.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:00.684
One day, when it is safe,

00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:03.480
I hope that you will be able
to return to the throne.

00:07:03.742 --> 00:07:06.667
[Shouting]

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:23.919
Ahem.

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:28.679
Yes.
You should be cautious

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:29.902
about what
you tell people.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.562
I'm telling you
what I saw.

00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:33.046
Nothing more.

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:37.501
I'm...I'm sensing a man

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:39.903
who is close to you
will betray you...

00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:44.140
yet another person close
will be there to protect you.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.974
Perhaps save your life.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:51.021
Sai Yuk, when do
we get to be alone?

00:07:51.608 --> 00:07:53.223
I thought
we were married.

00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:54.840
Doesn't seem
that way now.

00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:57.985
Don't be silly.
I love you.

00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:02.177
Oh. Then maybe you can
show your feelings.

00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:04.666
[Whispering]

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:08.335
Wait, you mean make
an ass of myself?

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.820
They'd laugh
at me.

00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:11.523
They might laugh...

00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:13.444
but I need to
hear it from you

00:08:13.532 --> 00:08:14.406
once in awhile.

00:08:14.624 --> 00:08:15.934
Hmm. All right then.

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:21.131
If it's a problem,
well, I'm sorry.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.010
Lay down here with me.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.241
All right, then.

00:08:26.722 --> 00:08:29.603
Good. But don't
make it sound wrong.

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:32.137
Hmm. All right.

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:36.155
I love you. Good?

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.727
Let's try it again.

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:39.343
Can you say it?

00:08:39.348 --> 00:08:42.056
- All right. I love you.
- Oh.

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.337
What?
Beat it right now.

00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:48.520
What he said
was pretty nice.

00:08:49.132 --> 00:08:51.097
I'd like to have
such a good boy.

00:08:51.315 --> 00:08:52.363
You're crazy!

00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:54.286
Hey, how about it?

00:08:55.028 --> 00:08:56.644
Sai Yuk, did you
hear what he said?

00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:58.210
Knock him out!

00:08:58.298 --> 00:08:59.390
But why?

00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:01.923
Because of what he said.
Let's beat him up right now.

00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:05.023
- Mmm!
- Don't try it.

00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:06.901
I'll do it!

00:09:06.989 --> 00:09:07.906
Think so?

00:09:08.212 --> 00:09:10.045
Hey, stop it now!
Come on!

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.572
[Both] Hey!
Your dad's calling you!

00:09:12.714 --> 00:09:14.418
See that?
Your father wants you.

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:15.553
Go on.

00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:18.130
There.

00:09:18.217 --> 00:09:19.615
I'll come back again.
You'll see.

00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:20.881
See you then.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.983
- Let's go.
- [Shouting]

00:09:27.564 --> 00:09:28.612
Go!

00:09:31.232 --> 00:09:32.499
They're good.

00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:41.190
[Clapping]

00:09:58.484 --> 00:10:00.755
[Chan]
Watch out! Reverend!

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.918
Aah!

00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:11.281
Someone, please!

00:10:14.862 --> 00:10:16.172
What happened?
I'll go see!

00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:22.811
[Yelling]

00:11:11.332 --> 00:11:13.079
All right.
Shall we do it?

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:14.652
[Yelling]

00:12:22.127 --> 00:12:23.525
I'm just waiting.

00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.106
Aah!

00:12:50.209 --> 00:12:51.520
Hold it!

00:12:52.524 --> 00:12:54.228
It could be a trap!

00:12:54.664 --> 00:12:55.886
Save your strength.

00:12:56.324 --> 00:12:58.507
[Man] The meeting of
the Red Flower Society

00:12:58.594 --> 00:12:59.992
will come to order.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.302
Congratulations.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.223
You men and women
have done well.

00:13:04.141 --> 00:13:06.194
Now let's hear from
some of our members.

00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:07.635
Who has a report?

00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:09.518
[Man] Mr. Chan, sir!

00:13:09.605 --> 00:13:11.002
Our new fishing rights
agreement

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:13.405
will take effect
at the start of the month.

00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:15.326
[Clapping]

00:13:15.413 --> 00:13:17.117
[Man 2] The brood mares
have given birth

00:13:17.203 --> 00:13:18.820
to three more colts!

00:13:19.038 --> 00:13:22.183
Ahh, it seems like
it's all good news, right?

00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:25.021
The society is doing
tremendously right now.

00:13:26.157 --> 00:13:28.515
The value of our property
in Shanghai

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:31.135
has increased three times!

00:13:31.223 --> 00:13:33.407
[Clapping]

00:13:34.018 --> 00:13:36.028
[Man] Sir,
all the good news

00:13:36.114 --> 00:13:37.381
calls for
a celebration!

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:39.653
[Chan] I'm afraid not.

00:13:40.132 --> 00:13:42.317
Some of our neighbours
have been victims

00:13:42.403 --> 00:13:43.757
of the recent flooding.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.461
We will loan them
some money.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.300
Wow. I could do
all that, right?

00:13:49.217 --> 00:13:51.662
No, you couldn't.
It'd be too much for you.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.545
What? Come on.
I'm up to it.

00:13:55.724 --> 00:13:58.476
Mr. Chan, will you honour us
by naming our baby?

00:13:59.262 --> 00:14:00.310
Yes, of course.

00:14:00.397 --> 00:14:01.576
Thank you, sir.

00:14:04.415 --> 00:14:05.682
He's a handsome boy.

00:14:05.944 --> 00:14:08.477
Why don't we name him
Sung Taian?

00:14:09.219 --> 00:14:12.146
I hope that he will give you
a lot of pleasure.

00:14:25.422 --> 00:14:26.514
Unh!

00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:28.654
Don't kill her!

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.856
She tried
to kill you, sir.

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:36.428
I had to do it.

00:14:37.214 --> 00:14:38.524
Why would Mrs. Leong--

00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:42.717
Look...
it's someone in a mask.

00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:44.245
Who could this be?

00:14:44.813 --> 00:14:46.997
Say, that woman
was with you.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.744
What happened
to Mrs. Leong?

00:14:49.486 --> 00:14:51.583
Hey, what are you
babbling about?

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:54.552
Why don't we ask him some
questions about the woman?

00:14:55.863 --> 00:14:58.090
Sure. Who's behind it?

00:14:58.483 --> 00:15:01.104
He's jealous because his father
didn't appoint him to lead us!

00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.720
Aren't you, Mr. Yun?

00:15:02.937 --> 00:15:05.470
And so you've become obsessed
with murdering our leader!

00:15:05.558 --> 00:15:07.917
- That's a complete lie!
- Prove it! You're a traitor, too!

00:15:08.003 --> 00:15:10.580
- [Crying]
- Stop that!

00:15:11.192 --> 00:15:14.292
How can we expect to overthrow
the Manchus when we fight each other?

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.734
We must stand united!

00:15:16.258 --> 00:15:17.350
He can forget it.

00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:20.189
Well, what happens if
we don't come together?

00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:22.416
What? What difference
would it make?

00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:25.343
The only good philosophy
would be to stay neutral.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.919
Oh, stay out of trouble,
is that what you're saying?

00:15:28.007 --> 00:15:31.850
Exactly.
You said it. You said it.

00:15:31.937 --> 00:15:34.340
For those of you
who question my loyalty

00:15:34.426 --> 00:15:36.304
to the Red Flower Society,

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.575
I will prove myself.

00:15:41.021 --> 00:15:42.200
Hey...

00:15:46.568 --> 00:15:48.140
So I see
you were fighting.

00:15:48.926 --> 00:15:51.197
Your father
was a loyal subject,

00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:56.001
and his son could not be
any less honourable.

00:15:57.617 --> 00:16:01.023
I promise that I will
search out this traitor scum

00:16:01.504 --> 00:16:02.727
and I will kill him!

00:16:03.077 --> 00:16:05.566
Father, what happened
with her now?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.055
- My son, go away.
- Hold on!

00:16:11.156 --> 00:16:13.733
Son, you've seen
this woman?

00:16:13.995 --> 00:16:16.790
Yes, sir. Dad was
talking with her

00:16:16.878 --> 00:16:18.711
before the meeting
started.

00:16:21.288 --> 00:16:23.167
Well,
there you have it.

00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:24.695
You shut your face!

00:16:30.809 --> 00:16:33.037
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

00:16:34.172 --> 00:16:35.788
- He's your own son!
- Who are you?

00:16:36.268 --> 00:16:37.447
Who am I?

00:16:38.015 --> 00:16:40.548
Aw, are you saying
that you don't know me?

00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:43.344
Well, I am our leader's
favourite relative...

00:16:43.562 --> 00:16:45.571
known as Fong Sai Yuk!

00:16:46.531 --> 00:16:47.579
Do you know who I am?

00:16:47.842 --> 00:16:49.851
Oh, yeah.
The boy beater.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.162
Unh!

00:16:51.248 --> 00:16:52.297
Down!

00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:54.655
What are you doing?

00:16:54.917 --> 00:16:56.751
Do you know who
Mr. Yun's father is?

00:16:57.013 --> 00:16:58.193
He's our former leader!

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.026
Sir. But the little boy was--

00:17:00.114 --> 00:17:01.992
That will be enough!
Mr. Dong!

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.826
Uh, why are you looking
at me like that?

00:17:04.394 --> 00:17:06.142
Give Fong Sai Yuk
some of your knowledge.

00:17:06.229 --> 00:17:07.408
Teach him
our commandments.

00:17:07.757 --> 00:17:09.417
- With pleasure!
- Good.

00:17:09.723 --> 00:17:11.120
See that he learns well.

00:17:17.672 --> 00:17:19.986
[Dong] The commandments of
the Red Flower Society.

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:24.178
One. You will not steal
another person's property.

00:17:24.265 --> 00:17:27.017
Two. You will not covet
the property of another.

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:30.729
Three. You will not covet
the wife of another man.

00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:32.783
Four. You will
always be truthful.

00:17:33.044 --> 00:17:35.927
Five. Honour our leader
in every way.

00:17:36.495 --> 00:17:38.809
Hey, are you getting it?
I'll start again.

00:17:39.551 --> 00:17:42.390
It's more like
the seven Taoist commands.

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.486
Yeah, that's just
where he got it from,

00:17:44.574 --> 00:17:46.714
and Mr. Yun has
adapted it for us.

00:17:47.107 --> 00:17:48.461
Huh. I thought so.

00:17:49.421 --> 00:17:51.562
[Yun] I see
you're a slow learner.

00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:56.585
Today you insulted me...

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.768
and I'm not
about to forget it.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.437
It's time you learned
a more important lesson

00:18:02.524 --> 00:18:05.013
from one
who is your superior.

00:18:05.494 --> 00:18:08.245
Who? The one who
hits boys?

00:18:08.813 --> 00:18:10.254
I'd like to
see you handle

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:13.050
someone
that hits back.

00:18:14.403 --> 00:18:15.888
How should
we settle this?

00:18:16.631 --> 00:18:19.687
Maybe your godfather
could come to your rescue.

00:18:19.906 --> 00:18:22.046
No! The book
of commandments

00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:25.453
says to settle this
a different way.

00:18:26.632 --> 00:18:27.855
Fighting.

00:18:29.601 --> 00:18:31.305
Are you ready to fight?

00:18:31.523 --> 00:18:32.571
Uh-oh.

00:19:11.747 --> 00:19:13.101
[Yun growls]

00:19:53.586 --> 00:19:55.376
[Yun growls]

00:20:06.295 --> 00:20:07.300
Enough!

00:20:07.518 --> 00:20:09.308
Fighting is not
for settling disputes

00:20:09.396 --> 00:20:10.837
within the society.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.020
We are a family!

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.335
You should save it
for the Manchus!

00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:16.340
I'm sorry.

00:20:16.602 --> 00:20:19.790
When someone insults
the Yun name...

00:20:23.153 --> 00:20:24.201
I will fight.

00:20:24.638 --> 00:20:27.084
Be prepared
to do it again.

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:33.897
The commandments
that you learned,

00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:35.731
did you understand them?

00:20:35.949 --> 00:20:37.041
Uncle, it wasn't me!

00:20:37.128 --> 00:20:38.657
That's enough!
Kneel!

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.068
- Your reason?
- The boy! His own child!

00:20:43.155 --> 00:20:44.728
No one should hurt
a baby like that.

00:20:44.946 --> 00:20:47.217
You are sure
in your convictions.

00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:49.052
It's your actions

00:20:49.488 --> 00:20:51.148
I'm concerned with
right now.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.987
But am I supposed
to just ignore it?

00:20:54.205 --> 00:20:57.131
Perhaps... yes.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.795
When it's necessary.

00:21:00.363 --> 00:21:02.153
You think too much
like your mother.

00:21:02.416 --> 00:21:04.163
Maybe you should
go home to her.

00:21:07.263 --> 00:21:09.011
So keep reading.

00:21:09.317 --> 00:21:10.888
I know he wants you
to learn it.

00:21:11.238 --> 00:21:13.072
Anyway,
this part's the hardest.

00:21:13.334 --> 00:21:14.469
Here.

00:21:27.484 --> 00:21:30.105
You know what?
He didn't have to do that.

00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:33.511
Maybe we ought to go and
visit with your mother.

00:21:33.948 --> 00:21:35.083
What?

00:21:35.783 --> 00:21:38.402
Well, why wouldn't we?

00:21:39.713 --> 00:21:41.460
I'll tell you all
one thing--

00:21:41.766 --> 00:21:43.032
one of these days...

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.176
I'll do it. Really.

00:21:46.745 --> 00:21:49.757
I'll be... the leader!

00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:54.169
Hey, come on!
Come on!

00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:55.348
Yeah.

00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:58.929
Soup. Soup always
has to be made

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:00.939
with only
the best vegetables.

00:22:01.025 --> 00:22:02.773
Madam, someone's here
to see you.

00:22:08.407 --> 00:22:10.634
What's this,
a birthday party?

00:22:10.721 --> 00:22:12.468
Tell me, where's Sai Yuk?

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:13.691
Why?

00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:16.530
From the Yangtze
to the Kowloon Harbour,

00:22:16.617 --> 00:22:18.277
I've fought them all

00:22:18.364 --> 00:22:20.242
and they call me
the Duke of Hell!

00:22:20.592 --> 00:22:21.727
Duke of Hell?

00:22:22.164 --> 00:22:24.566
I'll show you some hell.
Pbblt!

00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:30.724
Fong Sai Yuk's mother.

00:22:31.422 --> 00:22:33.082
Now, get the hell
out of my sight.

00:22:33.301 --> 00:22:34.523
Where's she going?

00:22:34.873 --> 00:22:36.488
Hey, stop her.

00:22:36.576 --> 00:22:38.367
There's just one more thing
I've got to say.

00:22:38.629 --> 00:22:41.031
- Yeah?
- Watch this. Bite me!

00:22:41.336 --> 00:22:44.700
[Yelling]

00:22:49.329 --> 00:22:50.770
Well, how'd you
like that one?

00:22:51.381 --> 00:22:54.176
Madam Fong,
that was a real good one.

00:22:54.613 --> 00:22:55.618
Oh, my soup.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.278
Oh, my.

00:22:57.845 --> 00:22:59.723
Is that for
Master Fong Sai Yuk?

00:23:00.073 --> 00:23:02.256
You bet it is.
See you later.

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:06.623
I miss my master so!

00:23:07.235 --> 00:23:09.069
Sai Yuk!

00:23:35.448 --> 00:23:38.899
My good sir, I wonder if
you might be able to help me.

00:23:39.291 --> 00:23:40.689
I'm all out of water.

00:23:41.737 --> 00:23:42.829
Ahh.

00:23:48.113 --> 00:23:49.860
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:23:58.072 --> 00:23:59.774
"On the first of the month,

00:23:59.862 --> 00:24:03.180
a band of Japanese samurai
will travel nearby.

00:24:04.361 --> 00:24:06.762
They will have
the sacred box

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.465
in which your secret
is hidden."

00:24:11.785 --> 00:24:12.920
Mr. Lin!

00:24:13.183 --> 00:24:14.318
Yes, sir!

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:15.715
[Chan] Mr. Wong!

00:24:15.933 --> 00:24:17.200
Here, sir!

00:24:25.367 --> 00:24:26.896
[Dong] I hope he doesn't
want me to go.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.180
- Mr. Dong.
- I don't think I'm ready yet.

00:24:32.442 --> 00:24:34.669
Take someone on the mission
who is more prepared.

00:24:34.757 --> 00:24:35.806
Calm down.

00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:39.124
Better to name a good fighter
to go on this mission.

00:24:39.648 --> 00:24:40.914
That won't be you.

00:24:41.439 --> 00:24:42.968
Who would be
your choice?

00:24:43.753 --> 00:24:46.592
Ha ha!
I say we take Sai Yuk

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.209
because he's always ready.

00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:50.959
That's what I think anyway.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.750
Fong Sai Yuk!

00:24:52.838 --> 00:24:54.148
Yo! Yes, sir!

00:24:54.498 --> 00:24:55.589
[Dong] Go, Sai Yuk!

00:24:57.904 --> 00:25:00.787
The mission is yours.
Do you accept it?

00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:02.184
I do!

00:25:02.272 --> 00:25:04.149
Some of you
may not come back.

00:25:04.455 --> 00:25:08.036
[All] Huh! All of us
are prepared to die!

00:25:08.517 --> 00:25:10.395
[Chan] Bring back
the sacred box!

00:25:17.775 --> 00:25:19.391
The numbers four and nine.

00:25:19.697 --> 00:25:22.754
Four and nine?
[Laughs]

00:25:22.841 --> 00:25:25.680
[Laughing]

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:27.558
What is so damn funny?

00:25:27.645 --> 00:25:28.824
Well,
they were laughing.

00:25:29.087 --> 00:25:31.184
Because you've got
the loser's hand.

00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:33.061
- In mahjong?
- Roulette.

00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:34.284
I don't play it.

00:25:34.546 --> 00:25:36.511
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Remember now?

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.564
Oh, yeah. Number six,
I shall not steal.

00:25:38.652 --> 00:25:41.097
Besides that.
You shall bring my girlfriend something.

00:25:41.315 --> 00:25:42.495
I won't forget.

00:25:43.019 --> 00:25:44.373
Bye. Good luck.

00:25:45.421 --> 00:25:47.648
Hyah!

00:25:50.312 --> 00:25:51.622
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.466
Hold on. Let's be certain
that you're safe.

00:25:56.209 --> 00:25:58.261
Take this. It's good luck.

00:25:58.567 --> 00:25:59.571
Yeah, you're right.

00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:01.450
We can't just
sit here all day.

00:26:01.886 --> 00:26:03.196
We're on a mission.

00:26:03.458 --> 00:26:05.773
Why are we waiting, then?
Good-bye.

00:26:07.476 --> 00:26:09.878
Stay safe, all right?
Bye-bye!

00:26:10.445 --> 00:26:12.499
Hyah! Hyah!

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:23.592
Ah, hello!
It's Mama Fong!

00:26:23.985 --> 00:26:25.383
Lei Ling!

00:26:26.779 --> 00:26:28.264
What brings you
here today?

00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:29.968
Go on. Go on.

00:26:30.361 --> 00:26:31.758
- My stable.
- [Man] Yes, miss.

00:26:31.846 --> 00:26:32.807
So, what's the occasion?

00:26:32.895 --> 00:26:34.248
I brought soup
for Sai Yuk.

00:26:34.335 --> 00:26:35.340
He's on a mission!

00:26:35.428 --> 00:26:38.091
Right now? But I made
some soup for him.

00:26:38.528 --> 00:26:41.542
I can't believe you brought
his favourite soup all this way.

00:26:41.847 --> 00:26:43.638
Mmm. Looks good.

00:26:56.784 --> 00:26:57.745
What's the matter?

00:26:58.356 --> 00:27:00.015
[Sai Yuk]
Quiet! Hear that?

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.578
[Sai Yuk]
It's the samurai!

00:27:30.587 --> 00:27:32.421
[Man] That woman's
in trouble.

00:27:34.037 --> 00:27:36.395
Wait. I've seen
that woman before.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.549
Hey, there, miss!

00:27:42.859 --> 00:27:44.126
What are you doing?
Get away!

00:27:44.213 --> 00:27:45.480
Hello, Sai.

00:27:45.786 --> 00:27:46.703
You know me?

00:27:48.536 --> 00:27:49.629
[Man] The sacred box!

00:27:50.983 --> 00:27:52.729
[Yelling]

00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:02.731
[Yelling]

00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:41.950
They used nerve blocking
to paralyse you,

00:28:42.212 --> 00:28:43.260
but I can undo it.

00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:48.676
Hey! I'm still paralysed
from the waist down!

00:28:49.112 --> 00:28:50.335
Oh.

00:28:54.877 --> 00:28:56.056
I'm sorry.

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:58.196
Go on.

00:29:00.423 --> 00:29:01.777
I'm not sure how.

00:29:08.285 --> 00:29:10.032
I'll carry you.
Come on.

00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:11.299
Oh!

00:29:56.719 --> 00:29:57.724
[Samurai] Get them!

00:29:57.811 --> 00:29:58.859
Go!

00:30:07.987 --> 00:30:09.821
[gasps]

00:30:20.128 --> 00:30:22.355
Yaah!

00:30:57.512 --> 00:30:59.609
[Samurai] I'm going
to paralyse you!

00:31:01.531 --> 00:31:03.016
Get them!

00:31:32.277 --> 00:31:33.281
Matsuhiro!

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.159
Matsuhiro?

00:31:36.121 --> 00:31:37.606
It's your mother.

00:31:38.129 --> 00:31:40.400
Ma! The box,
right there.

00:31:40.837 --> 00:31:42.104
We need it.

00:31:55.467 --> 00:31:56.865
Yes, sir.

00:32:19.575 --> 00:32:20.667
Still here?

00:32:20.754 --> 00:32:22.021
Still here!

00:32:28.223 --> 00:32:29.751
I'll take that box now.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.029
All my nerves
are blocked.

00:32:43.115 --> 00:32:44.383
Can she do
anything?

00:32:45.387 --> 00:32:47.527
Hmm? Oh, no.

00:32:48.181 --> 00:32:49.099
No?

00:32:49.318 --> 00:32:50.584
I wouldn't know how.

00:32:50.672 --> 00:32:51.851
Oh, come on.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.799
Hey, he'll do.

00:33:00.192 --> 00:33:02.463
[Buzzing]

00:33:05.477 --> 00:33:06.525
Ai!

00:33:07.704 --> 00:33:10.761
Now, try to get it
into a good position.

00:33:10.979 --> 00:33:13.949
Look out. Now blow it
at me hard.

00:33:19.409 --> 00:33:21.111
I keep missing.
You do it.

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:27.488
Your technique needs work.
It's too high.

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:31.462
[Gulp]

00:33:33.384 --> 00:33:34.389
It's so--

00:33:36.222 --> 00:33:37.140
I missed, huh?

00:33:38.276 --> 00:33:39.978
Sorry. Is it bad?

00:33:40.197 --> 00:33:44.565
Ugh. Tastes like
you'd expect it to taste.

00:33:45.263 --> 00:33:48.102
Hey, watch. It's going
to get interesting.

00:33:49.019 --> 00:33:50.504
Ohh!

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:04.786
That did it. Let's go.

00:34:08.192 --> 00:34:09.196
- What are you looking at?
- Me?

00:34:09.284 --> 00:34:10.506
Yeah, you.

00:34:10.769 --> 00:34:12.559
Wait. There's something
you can show me.

00:34:12.646 --> 00:34:14.656
All right, I'd be happy to.
What is it?

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:17.495
Well, how do you
unparalyse the legs?

00:34:17.843 --> 00:34:19.416
Just hit him
in the stomach.

00:34:20.464 --> 00:34:21.643
Oh.

00:34:40.816 --> 00:34:43.305
[Yun] That Fong Sai Yuck!

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.250
It's Fong Sai Yuk.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.092
Listen, son,
let me do the talking. Me.

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.403
But, Mum, you can't.

00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:57.587
There he goes!

00:34:57.674 --> 00:34:59.290
Following his mother
around again!

00:34:59.377 --> 00:35:01.299
[Laughter]

00:35:01.954 --> 00:35:05.622
I know.
Always her little dog.

00:35:06.234 --> 00:35:07.719
He follows her.

00:35:09.117 --> 00:35:11.650
If you have something to say,
then say it out loud,

00:35:11.911 --> 00:35:13.222
or keep your mouth shut.

00:35:13.615 --> 00:35:15.406
Look at you all
sitting here,

00:35:15.492 --> 00:35:18.332
stuffing your faces while
my son is out risking his neck

00:35:18.419 --> 00:35:20.079
for the Red Flower Society.

00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:23.529
If any of you had an ounce of bravery,
instead of sitting here,

00:35:23.616 --> 00:35:25.756
you'd be out doing
something about it.

00:35:25.843 --> 00:35:28.028
But all I see
are six or seven men

00:35:28.114 --> 00:35:30.735
who, I must say, haven't
shown me a damn thing!

00:35:30.953 --> 00:35:32.263
Shut up!

00:35:32.657 --> 00:35:33.923
On this mission,

00:35:34.142 --> 00:35:37.767
why was it only your son
who returned unharmed?

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.038
What of it?

00:35:42.265 --> 00:35:44.056
Does your mother
fight your battles?

00:35:45.715 --> 00:35:46.981
So!

00:35:49.428 --> 00:35:50.476
Simple...

00:35:50.563 --> 00:35:52.310
he fights better
than most of them.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.232
Understand?

00:35:59.603 --> 00:36:01.481
You want me?
Let's do it, then.

00:36:01.875 --> 00:36:03.840
Only remember
who started it.

00:36:04.189 --> 00:36:06.198
You don't have to fight
this fool for me.

00:36:06.285 --> 00:36:07.858
For once shut your mouth!

00:36:08.862 --> 00:36:09.735
I'm sick of it!

00:36:09.823 --> 00:36:12.837
Mr. Yun...
I'll take care of it.

00:36:12.924 --> 00:36:14.933
- Uh-huh.
- Mr. Chan,

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.855
if I might possibly have
a word with you?

00:36:16.942 --> 00:36:18.426
I'm Mrs. Fong.

00:36:18.514 --> 00:36:20.305
Yes. You're
Sai Yuk's mum.

00:36:21.484 --> 00:36:23.929
That's it?
The boy's mum?

00:36:24.323 --> 00:36:27.685
Mr. Chan, all of Han Mei
knows my reputation.

00:36:27.773 --> 00:36:29.302
Don't tell me
you don't know me.

00:36:29.389 --> 00:36:31.048
About all the fights
that I've won?

00:36:31.354 --> 00:36:32.708
Please tell me
you know me.

00:36:33.232 --> 00:36:35.591
You must be joking.
Can't be.

00:36:35.984 --> 00:36:37.381
Son, let's get out
of this house.

00:36:37.468 --> 00:36:39.172
I'm being toyed with.
Good day.

00:36:39.259 --> 00:36:40.963
We have a duty
to the Red Flower.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.796
Stay here then.
I'll go.

00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:44.587
Hmm?

00:36:46.596 --> 00:36:48.475
I think I've changed
my mind.

00:36:48.736 --> 00:36:50.702
If you happen to be
looking for me,

00:36:50.789 --> 00:36:51.837
I'll be here.

00:36:51.924 --> 00:36:53.977
[Thunder rumbling]

00:37:08.652 --> 00:37:11.359
It's pouring.
You shouldn't be out.

00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:12.800
I have come to visit.

00:37:14.722 --> 00:37:15.989
Ohh!

00:37:16.687 --> 00:37:17.910
Aah!

[Groaning]

00:37:19.395 --> 00:37:22.278
I've brought some presents.
A few trinkets...

00:37:22.365 --> 00:37:25.334
and some Japanese sakémoto.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.999
Stronger than wine.
Let me help.

00:37:28.086 --> 00:37:30.401
No, wait, no, wait. I'm not sure
I'm up to it.

00:37:30.838 --> 00:37:32.454
I haven't seen this before.

00:37:33.021 --> 00:37:34.812
Oh, well,
guess it's all mine.

00:37:35.118 --> 00:37:37.651
But it's immoral!

drink that in here!

Please!
I'm begging--Aah!

00:37:45.424 --> 00:37:46.647
That's right.

00:37:47.652 --> 00:37:50.098
You'd better help me...

00:37:51.059 --> 00:37:52.587
or I might get drunk.

00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:55.120
But it's sakémoto!

00:37:55.513 --> 00:37:56.954
We'll both end up drunk

00:37:57.216 --> 00:37:59.139
and you don't want--

Don't tell me
you're shy.

You're afraid
it will...

00:38:17.481 --> 00:38:20.975
go too far?

00:38:25.211 --> 00:38:28.443

to deserve this?!

I'd seen the last of her

so many years ago!

around to see us.

it once more?

No! Why do you tempt me

Damn fool!

00:39:16.746 --> 00:39:18.886
There's something
about sake.

00:39:19.847 --> 00:39:21.201
The more you drink...

00:39:21.944 --> 00:39:23.777
the more you want.

00:39:25.568 --> 00:39:28.581
All right, then. You have
to do something for me.

00:39:28.669 --> 00:39:29.892
- Huh?
- You...

00:39:29.979 --> 00:39:32.251
Just a minute now.

00:39:32.337 --> 00:39:36.137
I'm not interested
in prostituting myself.

00:39:36.355 --> 00:39:38.496
I'm sure I'll survive
without that.

00:39:38.714 --> 00:39:41.859
Listen, I want you to teach me
the fatal nerve block.

00:39:42.077 --> 00:39:44.872
Shh.

00:39:44.959 --> 00:39:47.056
Shh. Shh.

00:39:47.448 --> 00:39:49.458
But that's
a secret move.

00:39:49.808 --> 00:39:51.598
It won't be
imparted now.

00:39:51.685 --> 00:39:52.995
Maybe you should
hear me out.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.572
Fong Sai Yuk is the one
who needs to learn it.

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:57.494
I want you
to show it to him.

00:39:58.847 --> 00:40:00.944
What for?
I mean, why?

00:40:01.032 --> 00:40:02.211
Why do you think?

00:40:02.298 --> 00:40:03.913
So the rest of them
who know it

00:40:04.219 --> 00:40:07.321
won't be able to take advantage
of him so much anymore.

00:40:08.019 --> 00:40:09.067
[Snoring]

00:40:09.154 --> 00:40:10.202
Ooh!

[Rooster Crows]

00:40:14.308 --> 00:40:17.016
[Grunting]

00:40:25.226 --> 00:40:26.494
Hey!

00:40:27.192 --> 00:40:28.415
Keep quiet about it.

00:40:28.633 --> 00:40:29.900
Oh, shut up.

00:40:31.035 --> 00:40:33.306
Ever try good manners?

00:40:34.005 --> 00:40:35.097
Old bat.

00:40:42.434 --> 00:40:43.613
Good morning.

00:40:43.701 --> 00:40:45.797
Lei Ling. Did you
sleep all right?

00:40:47.063 --> 00:40:48.111
What are you
wearing?

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:51.431
I was
practising.

00:40:54.968 --> 00:40:56.410
Hey, I have a question.

00:40:56.802 --> 00:41:01.214
If a married woman
were to, um, to...

00:41:01.476 --> 00:41:03.005
s-sleep with someone,

00:41:03.091 --> 00:41:05.494
a person to whom
she wasn't married,

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.594
but the two of them
were doing it,

00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:11.696
doing it,
well, you know.

00:41:11.913 --> 00:41:13.267
You know what
they were doing.

00:41:13.748 --> 00:41:15.277
Do you think
there's anything wrong?

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.683
Mum, what?
Something so low?

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:23.705
There's not even a good word
for what she's doing.

00:41:24.405 --> 00:41:27.243
I mean, I just think
sleeping around like that

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.684
can't be forgiven.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.650
I mean,
what kind of woman

00:41:30.736 --> 00:41:32.746
would carry on
like that?

00:41:33.008 --> 00:41:34.624
You know very well
that it's wrong.

00:41:34.886 --> 00:41:36.677
Now, what kind of woman
could this person be,

00:41:36.764 --> 00:41:39.079
sleeping with a man
she isn't married to?

00:41:39.341 --> 00:41:40.739
What was she thinking?

00:41:41.306 --> 00:41:43.272
The whole town should--
they should just destroy

00:41:43.358 --> 00:41:44.712
this little whore
as an example

00:41:44.974 --> 00:41:46.503
so it won't
happen again.

00:41:47.114 --> 00:41:49.167
So, now that
we've settled that,

00:41:49.691 --> 00:41:51.307
do you want to go
to the market today?

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:53.491
Lei Ling?

00:41:53.884 --> 00:41:55.107
Lei Ling?

00:42:07.685 --> 00:42:08.908
Hey!

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.184
What are you doing?
I'm all naked!

00:42:12.401 --> 00:42:15.328
You should have kept
your clothes on last night.

00:42:15.765 --> 00:42:17.162
This is what you did!

00:42:17.686 --> 00:42:19.608
[Gasps]
She's pregnant!

00:42:21.486 --> 00:42:24.062
Wait!
It's not possible!

00:42:26.508 --> 00:42:28.430
Damn it! Get out
of there right now!

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:31.749
Let me show you what I do to
guys who take advantage of me

00:42:31.836 --> 00:42:34.238
while I'm sleeping,
you lousy little pig!

00:42:34.326 --> 00:42:36.597
- I oughta cut you a new--
- Hey, put that thing away!

00:42:36.815 --> 00:42:40.309
Not until I'm finished!
I'll make you pay for this!

00:42:40.571 --> 00:42:42.012
Aah!

00:42:44.808 --> 00:42:45.943
Listen, think about it!

00:42:46.248 --> 00:42:47.341
Even if something happened,

00:42:47.428 --> 00:42:49.830
it's not possible for you
to get that big so soon!

00:42:49.918 --> 00:42:50.922
Sure,
that's what you say.

00:42:51.009 --> 00:42:52.799
It's got to be
something else.

00:42:52.887 --> 00:42:54.634
There's no way
something like that

00:42:54.722 --> 00:42:55.988
can happen overnight!

00:42:56.076 --> 00:42:58.390
I've heard the same story
a lot of times before!

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:00.574
You set me up to have
your way with me!

00:43:00.792 --> 00:43:02.932
No, listen, it's got
to be something else!

00:43:03.019 --> 00:43:04.198
Like what?

00:43:04.286 --> 00:43:06.906
I can tell you what it is
by taking your pulse!

00:43:06.994 --> 00:43:08.348
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:43:08.741 --> 00:43:11.056
Gas!
When you're drunk,

00:43:11.535 --> 00:43:12.758
you get gas!

00:43:14.068 --> 00:43:15.248
Ohh!

00:43:20.838 --> 00:43:23.240
[Mandarin] The samurai
have brought me the box...

00:43:26.429 --> 00:43:29.136
so I want all of you
to guard it well.

00:43:29.223 --> 00:43:30.185
Yes, sir!

00:43:30.272 --> 00:43:33.504
[Humming]

00:43:35.774 --> 00:43:36.997
[laughs]

Sho Soo Li.

00:43:41.584 --> 00:43:43.068
Sho Soo Li!

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:44.465
Yes, Father.

00:43:45.165 --> 00:43:46.824
What are you
daydreaming about?

00:43:47.698 --> 00:43:48.702
A boy.

00:43:49.008 --> 00:43:50.275
[Mandarin]
Well, that's enough.

00:43:52.021 --> 00:43:54.074
We failed in our attempt
this time.

00:43:54.729 --> 00:43:56.127
Now the leader's ready.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.354
Fong is a problem.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:00.407
But we can still do it.

00:44:00.843 --> 00:44:03.070
Sir, but now
we're under suspicion.

00:44:03.289 --> 00:44:04.686
So what?

00:44:05.167 --> 00:44:07.219
If we're under suspicion,

00:44:07.569 --> 00:44:10.102
I have information
that there's a secret

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.023
about Mr. Chan

00:44:12.111 --> 00:44:14.819
in the container
that the samurai brought

00:44:14.906 --> 00:44:16.042
to the mandarin.

00:44:16.129 --> 00:44:17.177
We'll get it.

00:44:17.483 --> 00:44:19.405
[Chan] I'm concerned
that someone may

00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:21.370
try to steal
the sacred box.

00:44:22.243 --> 00:44:23.379
If that should happen,

00:44:23.597 --> 00:44:26.480
then I'm afraid
my chances of ruling

00:44:26.567 --> 00:44:27.615
will be gone.

00:44:27.703 --> 00:44:29.711
Master, the mandarin's daughter

00:44:29.799 --> 00:44:31.633
seems to be fond
of Sai Yuk.

00:44:31.721 --> 00:44:33.162
Why not send him
after it?

00:44:33.642 --> 00:44:34.996
I don't think so.

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:37.835
It's too dangerous
for him.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.635
But, sir,
please think about it.

00:44:42.028 --> 00:44:44.299
The mandarin's daughter
would know

00:44:44.386 --> 00:44:47.050
exactly where her father's
secrets are kept.

00:44:47.137 --> 00:44:48.928
Don't you agree
with that?

00:44:49.278 --> 00:44:51.680
You see, sir,
I've composed a letter.

00:44:51.898 --> 00:44:53.339
[Sai Yuk]
Are you here, Godfather?

00:44:55.915 --> 00:44:56.964
Sai Yuk, what is it?

00:44:57.052 --> 00:44:58.362
My mother made some soup.

00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:00.327
[Chan] I have another
assignment for you.

00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:03.602
- Yes?
- Listen, the box was located.

00:45:03.689 --> 00:45:04.607
Good, then.

00:45:04.695 --> 00:45:07.270
That shows that
anything can be done.

00:45:07.358 --> 00:45:08.407
Precisely.

00:45:08.494 --> 00:45:09.891
Except
it isn't finished.

00:45:09.978 --> 00:45:11.900
Right.
What's the mission?

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.517
Here.

00:45:13.603 --> 00:45:14.608
Take a look.

00:45:18.713 --> 00:45:20.766
This is a love letter
from me.

00:45:20.854 --> 00:45:22.295
Uh, yes.

00:45:22.381 --> 00:45:24.435
This is just how you begin
your assignment--

00:45:24.741 --> 00:45:25.964
Talking to a woman

00:45:26.181 --> 00:45:29.151
and thereby establishing
some kind of way

00:45:29.239 --> 00:45:31.291
to win her trust,
so she'll help us.

00:45:31.378 --> 00:45:32.426
Understand?

00:45:33.257 --> 00:45:35.528
But, wait. No, no, no.
No, no, no.

00:45:35.615 --> 00:45:37.667
But what--what if my wife
finds out about it?

00:45:37.755 --> 00:45:39.546
Hey, now, don't you
worry about it.

00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:41.075
I mean, who's going
to tell her?

00:45:41.511 --> 00:45:42.777
I suppose.

00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:45.966
But should I pretend
that I'm in love?

00:45:46.708 --> 00:45:47.800
It's up to you.

00:45:47.887 --> 00:45:49.591
I just want you
to get close to her.

00:45:50.028 --> 00:45:51.512
And have sex with her?

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:52.910
No sex.

00:45:53.478 --> 00:45:55.050
You get my box.

00:45:55.312 --> 00:45:56.797
You're going
to the Mandarin Palace.

00:45:57.103 --> 00:45:58.151
That's where
you'll meet her.

00:45:58.369 --> 00:46:01.077
Is this girl someone
that I've seen yet?

00:46:01.296 --> 00:46:02.475
Yes.

00:46:02.562 --> 00:46:05.183
You will recognise her
when you see her face.

00:46:05.575 --> 00:46:07.758
I hope she won't want
to get married.

00:46:08.327 --> 00:46:10.379
- That would be a disaster.
- [Yun] Mr. Chan,

00:46:11.122 --> 00:46:13.262
what about me, sir?

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.755
I'll volunteer to go.

00:46:17.542 --> 00:46:18.721
Yeah.

00:46:19.288 --> 00:46:20.642
He could take my place.

00:46:21.036 --> 00:46:22.696
But you're not
a ladies' man. Ow!

00:46:23.787 --> 00:46:25.010
Listen!

00:46:25.229 --> 00:46:27.150
He failed on
the previous mission.

00:46:28.198 --> 00:46:29.814
Now it's my turn to try.

00:46:30.208 --> 00:46:32.435
But your father worked
against the mandarin.

00:46:32.653 --> 00:46:34.400
They wouldn't let you in
without a fight.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.714
Sai Yuk isn't known
to them at all.

00:46:37.632 --> 00:46:38.767
Yes...

00:46:39.161 --> 00:46:40.470
and she really likes him.

00:46:40.557 --> 00:46:41.780
We'll see.

00:46:42.086 --> 00:46:43.659
We'll see.

00:46:43.746 --> 00:46:45.100
I just might succeed.

00:46:45.406 --> 00:46:46.541
You betting on it?

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:48.681
Certainly. Why don't
we set a wager?

00:46:48.769 --> 00:46:50.472
What is your bet?

00:46:50.865 --> 00:46:52.524
If I lose,
I'll find a way

00:46:52.612 --> 00:46:53.878
to destroy my kung fu.

00:46:54.358 --> 00:46:55.537
All right, then.

00:46:57.241 --> 00:46:58.508
Don't be worried.

00:46:59.294 --> 00:47:02.220
[Soo Li] "A chance meeting
along the riverbank

00:47:02.613 --> 00:47:05.757
and now I have
only fate to thank.

00:47:06.325 --> 00:47:09.426
I long for a word, a glance, a look.

00:47:09.513 --> 00:47:12.002
I remain your servant,
Fong Sai Yuk."

00:47:14.056 --> 00:47:15.846
Oh, how wonderful!

00:47:17.855 --> 00:47:20.126
[laughs]

00:47:38.425 --> 00:47:39.605
[gasps]

00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:40.828
Dad.

00:47:47.378 --> 00:47:49.694
A young man
wants to court me.

00:47:50.523 --> 00:47:52.925
I know that
you'll like him.

00:47:55.458 --> 00:47:57.379
So, who is
this young man?

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.214
Is he a scoundrel?

00:47:59.302 --> 00:48:00.830
No. He's not.

00:48:02.708 --> 00:48:05.241
Well, then, if he wants
to court you,

00:48:05.678 --> 00:48:06.901
he'll have to
prove himself.

00:48:06.988 --> 00:48:08.167
Well, that's perfect.

00:48:14.238 --> 00:48:16.552
Mum, shouldn't I tell
Ting Ting?

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.037
No. There she is.

00:48:18.343 --> 00:48:19.391
Hold this.

00:48:19.785 --> 00:48:21.181
Wait.
I don't want it.

00:48:21.269 --> 00:48:22.230
You hold it.

00:48:22.318 --> 00:48:23.584
All right.
Listen.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.680
Yeah?
What should I do?

00:48:25.768 --> 00:48:27.078
You should just
kiss her, that's what.

00:48:27.165 --> 00:48:28.301
Don't play shy.

00:48:28.388 --> 00:48:29.742
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

00:48:30.222 --> 00:48:31.882
Just go right over there
and give her one.

00:48:31.969 --> 00:48:33.236
- Right here?
- There she is.

00:48:33.454 --> 00:48:34.502
Okay, then.

00:48:44.897 --> 00:48:47.212
Let's get to it, hmm?

00:48:49.308 --> 00:48:52.496
You've come to me
at long last.

00:48:53.369 --> 00:48:55.509
- But we, uh--
- Are you scared?

00:48:55.597 --> 00:48:56.645
Ma?

00:48:56.732 --> 00:48:58.261
I'll fix that.

00:48:59.003 --> 00:49:00.706
Come on.
Don't be afraid.

00:49:01.187 --> 00:49:02.497
You should've
kissed him.

00:49:03.545 --> 00:49:04.550
Hmmph!

00:49:06.297 --> 00:49:08.131
She wants you
all the more.

00:49:08.655 --> 00:49:09.747
What's the matter?

00:49:09.834 --> 00:49:10.926
Nothing.

00:49:12.062 --> 00:49:13.984
You don't want to let
her get away now.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.686
Better go.

00:49:17.826 --> 00:49:19.180
All right. Unh!

00:49:20.273 --> 00:49:21.321
Ooh!

00:49:28.002 --> 00:49:29.139
That was easy.

00:49:29.837 --> 00:49:30.885
Oh!

00:49:31.147 --> 00:49:33.374
Mmm.

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:36.082
What are you doing?
Go after her.

00:49:36.476 --> 00:49:38.134
What?
You mean...

00:49:38.965 --> 00:49:40.755
You kissed
one of the Buddhist nuns?

00:49:41.673 --> 00:49:44.119
Hey, it could be the first
kiss that she ever got.

00:49:44.206 --> 00:49:45.559
- Now come on.
- Okay.

00:49:45.777 --> 00:49:46.957
She might ask you
for more.

00:49:47.044 --> 00:49:48.573
Ahh! Ahh!

00:49:50.756 --> 00:49:52.329
I must've
scared her away.

00:49:52.416 --> 00:49:53.639
Maybe she doesn't
want me.

00:49:53.726 --> 00:49:55.735
- Oh, stop it.
- Stop what?

00:49:55.822 --> 00:49:56.870
[Soo Li] Sai Yuk,

00:49:56.958 --> 00:49:58.618
do you want to
marry me or not?

00:49:58.705 --> 00:50:01.194
Sure, I do, but there's
one condition.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:02.636
Well, what is it?

00:50:02.723 --> 00:50:03.771
That box you have.

00:50:03.859 --> 00:50:05.736
All right.
I can get it somehow,

00:50:05.824 --> 00:50:07.352
but you'll also have
to prove yourself

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.663
in a competition
you'll win,

00:50:08.925 --> 00:50:10.802
and you'll also
declare your love.

00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:12.331
- Deal.
- Bet on it.

00:50:43.689 --> 00:50:45.655
The competition
will soon start.

00:50:46.965 --> 00:50:49.629
The winner
will marry Sho Soo Li.

00:50:50.371 --> 00:50:53.035
The rules are simple,
so now listen.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.962
Whichever man
retrieves the flowered ball

00:50:56.048 --> 00:50:57.795
from the top
of the bridal sedan,

00:50:58.101 --> 00:50:59.805
I shall proclaim
the winner,

00:50:59.891 --> 00:51:02.032
and then he will also wed
my daughter.

00:51:03.211 --> 00:51:05.832
The true competition
will now begin.

00:51:06.224 --> 00:51:07.797
[Playing fanfare]

00:51:10.199 --> 00:51:11.990
[Crowd] Ohh.

00:51:12.383 --> 00:51:14.959
Ooh, what
arresting beauty.

00:51:17.056 --> 00:51:18.497
[Soo Li] Where is he?

00:51:21.816 --> 00:51:23.607
She'll make
a fine bride.

00:51:24.524 --> 00:51:25.528
Too bad.

00:51:25.878 --> 00:51:27.319
Too bad
she'll be mine.

00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:28.935
I'll win.

00:51:30.026 --> 00:51:31.294
She'll be
my wife

00:51:31.511 --> 00:51:32.822
once I'm
finished.

00:51:33.565 --> 00:51:36.054
Sorry, my friends,

00:51:36.796 --> 00:51:37.975
I'm going to win.

00:51:38.237 --> 00:51:39.548
Contestants, get ready.

00:51:39.854 --> 00:51:41.251
[Men grunt]

00:51:41.818 --> 00:51:42.779
And start!

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.395
[Yelling]

00:52:28.943 --> 00:52:30.428
Kick them!

[Men Yelling]

00:53:12.223 --> 00:53:13.446
Mmm!

00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:25.332
I told you we'd be late
carrying this flagpole.

00:54:25.682 --> 00:54:27.909
Don't worry. These guys
can't keep us out.

00:54:28.826 --> 00:54:29.831
[Both] What do you want?

00:54:30.268 --> 00:54:32.059
- The girl.
- The kung fu contest.

00:54:32.146 --> 00:54:33.718
- He's too late.
- Am I?

00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:38.129
Hmm.

00:54:39.046 --> 00:54:40.007
Ohh! Aah!

00:54:40.095 --> 00:54:41.754
[Laughter]

00:54:46.907 --> 00:54:48.480
Aha! Oh!

00:55:01.756 --> 00:55:02.674
Ooh.

00:55:11.365 --> 00:55:12.588
[Man] Hey!

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:17.436
Hello.

00:55:19.619 --> 00:55:20.754
- Huh?
- Hey, there.

00:55:24.379 --> 00:55:26.126
Aah!

00:55:26.781 --> 00:55:28.485
[Crowd] Ohh!

00:55:33.114 --> 00:55:34.163
Yeah.

About time
you made it.

00:55:41.238 --> 00:55:42.286
I'm sorry.

00:55:43.596 --> 00:55:44.556
Have you been waiting?

00:55:45.823 --> 00:55:47.221
So long.

00:55:47.527 --> 00:55:48.662
Bored yet?

00:55:50.453 --> 00:55:52.156
Hey, don't get thrown off.

00:55:54.907 --> 00:55:57.266
Well, men,
have a nice ride down.

00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:13.032
Are you ready?

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.303
I was hoping you were
going to ask me that.

00:56:20.763 --> 00:56:21.811
All right.

00:56:25.698 --> 00:56:27.313
[All] Aah!

00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:34.389
Good, huh?

00:56:34.476 --> 00:56:35.655
Wow.

00:56:35.917 --> 00:56:37.620
Just amazing. Huh?

00:56:43.123 --> 00:56:45.350
I know.
You want me to jump.

00:56:46.267 --> 00:56:49.019
Hai!

00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:50.591
- Whoo.
- Let's go.

00:56:52.819 --> 00:56:54.216
Thanks.

00:57:05.222 --> 00:57:06.357
What? Huh?

00:57:06.838 --> 00:57:08.715
- Hmm?
- What's the matter?

00:57:09.284 --> 00:57:10.594
Can't you look me in the eye?

00:57:10.681 --> 00:57:12.297
Ahh. Ready?

00:57:12.515 --> 00:57:14.000
Hey, wait.

00:57:14.262 --> 00:57:15.398
I'm shocked.

00:57:15.485 --> 00:57:16.446
Wait a minute.

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:18.018
Come on.
Let me explain.

00:57:18.106 --> 00:57:19.460
Have you gone crazy?

00:57:19.766 --> 00:57:21.993
Didn't you think
I'd find out about this?

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.613
- Well, yes, but there's more to this...
- I don't want to hear it.

00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:25.880
...than there seems
to be right now.

00:57:25.967 --> 00:57:27.277
- I'm not going to listen.
- If you'd listen--

00:57:27.365 --> 00:57:28.413
I'm not!

00:57:29.723 --> 00:57:30.815
That might've hurt.

00:57:31.033 --> 00:57:32.212
How about this?

00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:35.051
[Crowd] Oh!

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:38.633
Come on, settle down.

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.681
I'm not done.

00:57:40.641 --> 00:57:41.908
Be sensible.

00:57:41.995 --> 00:57:42.999
I will not.

00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:46.363
Why is she bothering us?

00:57:48.066 --> 00:57:49.026
Uh--

00:57:49.114 --> 00:57:52.696
I'll tell you why.
I'm his wife.

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.748
Don't believe it.

00:57:55.446 --> 00:57:57.368
Oh, two can play at that.

00:57:57.456 --> 00:57:58.854
All right.

00:57:59.464 --> 00:58:00.731
Wait!

00:58:13.659 --> 00:58:14.663
Creep!

00:58:22.393 --> 00:58:23.878

a better way.

[Straining]

00:58:33.923 --> 00:58:35.146
Let me at them.

00:58:42.702 --> 00:58:44.056
[Ting Ting] Ohh!

00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:47.287
Ma.

00:58:49.209 --> 00:58:50.257
You asked for it.

00:58:50.824 --> 00:58:52.310
Will you help me
break this up?

00:58:52.834 --> 00:58:54.101
- Who should I take?
- That one.

00:58:55.629 --> 00:58:56.808
- Li, come on.
- Ting Ting.

00:58:57.026 --> 00:58:58.817
- Please, stop fighting.
- Come on now.

00:59:00.084 --> 00:59:02.573
Listen, he's doing--
he doesn't love her.

00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.927
Well, I don't care.

00:59:04.014 --> 00:59:05.718
Someone should've mentioned
something to me.

00:59:05.805 --> 00:59:07.595
Hey, you wouldn't have
wanted him to do it.

00:59:07.683 --> 00:59:08.731
- Come on now, Li.
- Let me go.

00:59:08.818 --> 00:59:11.220
Let me go. I'll make you
into a slave.

00:59:11.439 --> 00:59:12.749
Let me see you
try it.

00:59:13.142 --> 00:59:14.889

Please, please.

Hey, take it easy.

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:20.130
The minute he realises
what kind of woman you are,

00:59:20.217 --> 00:59:21.964
he'll drop her
like an old habit.

00:59:22.052 --> 00:59:23.623
- Whoa now!
- Why?

00:59:23.711 --> 00:59:25.196
Well, it was
for Mr. Chan.

00:59:25.983 --> 00:59:27.554
All right. If you don't
care about her,

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.607
- then go slap her.
- I will.

00:59:30.044 --> 00:59:31.092
Stop.

00:59:31.922 --> 00:59:33.363
You want that box?

00:59:34.455 --> 00:59:35.722
Huh?

00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:36.813
All right.
then I'll do it.

00:59:36.901 --> 00:59:37.861

away from Sai Yuk.

He loves me,
not you.

Just ask him
if you don't believe me.

Unless you're afraid to.

Hmm?

Why won't you
look at me?

00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:58.039
- But--
- So, I'll jump, then.

Stop it. Why won't you
let me fall?

01:00:19.002 --> 01:00:21.230
[Strains] I won't.
You're my wife.

01:00:21.491 --> 01:00:23.238
I'm supposed to be
your only wife.

01:00:23.894 --> 01:00:26.165
Sai Yuk, save me!

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:28.042
What?

01:00:33.633 --> 01:00:34.681
[Soo Li] So strong.

01:00:34.768 --> 01:00:36.297
Just like you are
in bed.

01:00:36.384 --> 01:00:37.607
Hmm. Ha ha!

01:00:37.956 --> 01:00:39.441
You took her to bed?

01:00:39.747 --> 01:00:42.105
All right. Let me loose,
and I'll fall, okay?

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:43.940
What are you doing?

01:00:44.332 --> 01:00:45.599
She's making it up.

Let me go!

an old lady, huh?

01:00:50.534 --> 01:00:52.412
Aah!

Oh, boy. Uhh!

my new son-in-law.

I love you,

The outside world

01:02:34.434 --> 01:02:36.486

to the wedded couple.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.548

in its tender embrace

01:02:43.212 --> 01:02:45.090

as companions.

Whoops. Huh?

01:02:58.542 --> 01:02:59.896

Lei Ling, I don't want
to hear that right now.

Shall I sing a song
instead?

01:03:07.015 --> 01:03:08.456
I keep remembering

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:12.648
Sai Yuk reciting
those words to me.

01:03:15.924 --> 01:03:17.758
What do you say?
Shall we?

01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:19.724
What's your hurry?

01:03:20.946 --> 01:03:22.650
I'll keep my end
of the bargain

01:03:22.737 --> 01:03:24.090
as long as you keep yours.

[Soo Li] What do you
really want?

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.637
Me or what's in
your old box?

01:03:29.725 --> 01:03:31.996
What?
You know I want the box.

01:03:33.656 --> 01:03:34.660

to be in a rush.

you're going?

- To church.
- To eat.

Is that so?

01:04:38.467 --> 01:04:40.170
You used deception on us.

You've fooled us
to get what you wanted.

Now...

I'll take back the box

01:04:48.949 --> 01:04:50.434
you stole from her.

01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:53.317
Is that what she said?
Now, how can that be?

01:04:53.578 --> 01:04:54.844
Why don't you
ask her again?

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:56.723
Enough of your fooling.

01:04:57.203 --> 01:04:58.425

come from, huh?

the box.

then I die.

your own life?

- Save it for some other time.

rather see it burned?

Ah, you want me
to destroy it,

so no one
can learn the truth.

I must've been blind

not to see
such an ambitious man,

I don't think
you have the box at all.

01:11:19.216 --> 01:11:21.881
Would you listen to me?
All his nerve endings are intact.

01:11:21.968 --> 01:11:23.453
We can bring
his skill back.

01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:25.112
- Do you mean it?
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:28.476 --> 01:11:29.611
[Mother] Sai Yuk.

01:11:29.961 --> 01:11:31.009
Sai Yuk.

01:11:32.842 --> 01:11:33.847
Ma...

01:11:34.153 --> 01:11:35.507
make sure he gets it.

01:11:35.769 --> 01:11:37.385
Ah, so the box
showed up...

01:11:39.612 --> 01:11:42.276
and Mr. Chan is really
the emperor.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.412
Emperor?

01:11:44.285 --> 01:11:45.464
But that means trouble.

01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:47.211
I'll destroy it
as soon as possible.

01:11:47.299 --> 01:11:48.303
- Hey.
- What?

01:11:48.391 --> 01:11:50.399
Don't you dare destroy it.

01:11:50.487 --> 01:11:51.709
This will come in handy.

01:11:51.797 --> 01:11:53.937
[Woman] Li Dong,
open up. It's me.

01:11:56.426 --> 01:11:57.519
I came to warn you all.

01:11:57.606 --> 01:11:58.785
Yun and his men
are on the way.

01:11:58.873 --> 01:11:59.833
That's it.

01:12:00.269 --> 01:12:01.492
- Faster.
- All right. Now hurry.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.502
- Let's get out of here.
- We have to be faster.

01:12:07.432 --> 01:12:08.786
Unh.

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:13.984
Have Fong read it.

01:12:14.551 --> 01:12:16.559
The book on nerve blocking.
Thank you.

01:12:16.647 --> 01:12:20.185
They're here. Make sure he reads it all.
Better get moving now. Go!

01:12:22.762 --> 01:12:24.640
- Come on!
- Over there!

01:12:24.727 --> 01:12:26.081
[Man] Surround the house!

01:12:29.575 --> 01:12:31.672
Company, halt! Come out!

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.645
Fong Sai Yuk,
your day has come.

01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:39.838
He won't be needed!

01:12:39.925 --> 01:12:42.459
[Laughing]

01:12:44.729 --> 01:12:45.690
You know what?

01:12:46.302 --> 01:12:48.092
This is your day to die!

01:12:48.442 --> 01:12:50.014
I wouldn't be so sure
about it.

01:12:50.101 --> 01:12:51.237
Go get him!

01:13:10.497 --> 01:13:11.545
Not too bad, eh?

01:13:11.939 --> 01:13:13.248
Wait until you see
my nerve blocking.

01:13:14.952 --> 01:13:17.397
[Clucks]

01:13:42.073 --> 01:13:44.955
Aah!

01:13:45.392 --> 01:13:47.096
Here, why don't
you take him?

01:13:47.445 --> 01:13:48.580
I'm going back.

01:13:50.284 --> 01:13:51.244
Can you help him?

01:13:52.904 --> 01:13:55.000
- Please.
- I'll try. Who are you?

01:13:55.219 --> 01:13:56.616
We're getting married.

01:13:58.189 --> 01:14:00.023
Please,
take care of him.

01:14:01.158 --> 01:14:04.826
Where is he? Talk!

01:14:04.914 --> 01:14:06.050
Go to hell.

01:14:10.373 --> 01:14:12.077
Hey, are you all right?

01:14:12.644 --> 01:14:14.566
Find him outside, men!
Go get him!

01:14:24.786 --> 01:14:27.057
Aah!

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.503
Dong! Oh, my God!

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.468
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:14:31.555 --> 01:14:32.865
[Groans]

01:14:33.259 --> 01:14:34.307
No.

01:14:34.787 --> 01:14:38.368
I must...
have been rusty.

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:41.687
It's been a while
between fights.

01:14:42.212 --> 01:14:43.609
[Groans]

01:14:45.618 --> 01:14:47.147
I should have...

01:14:49.112 --> 01:14:53.261
ohh, I should have
stayed out of it.

01:14:53.829 --> 01:14:55.357
[Groans]

01:14:56.013 --> 01:14:57.890
But you were so brave.

01:14:58.589 --> 01:14:59.681
You saved me.

01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:06.189
Th-that would be
the first time

01:15:06.887 --> 01:15:10.949
I've saved anyone
in a while.

01:15:11.822 --> 01:15:14.443
[Groans] Oh, God.

01:15:15.403 --> 01:15:16.670
Keep my

01:15:17.892 --> 01:15:21.431
memory alive.

01:15:22.479 --> 01:15:23.833
Please.

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:28.069
Please.

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.436
I promise.

01:15:35.711 --> 01:15:37.371
I won't forget.

01:15:38.769 --> 01:15:40.559
[Sobbing]

01:15:51.653 --> 01:15:54.622
[Footsteps]

01:15:59.907 --> 01:16:01.567
[Yun] I believe...

01:16:04.492 --> 01:16:07.419
this is what
you've been looking for.

01:16:08.991 --> 01:16:13.009
It tells me
a great deal about you...

01:16:13.795 --> 01:16:15.411
the would-be emperor.

01:16:16.153 --> 01:16:18.512
You are powerless
without your followers.

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.132
We have laid waste to them.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.622
As I will to you!

01:16:27.946 --> 01:16:29.081
Not yet.

01:16:29.823 --> 01:16:33.143
Your fight with me is liable
to be your final fight.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:36.943
Well, do you suppose
I'd come without my men?

01:16:38.078 --> 01:16:39.563
Go ahead.

01:16:41.441 --> 01:16:43.013
See what happens
to your men.

01:16:43.624 --> 01:16:45.196
- No. I can't.
- [Men] Kill him!

01:16:45.502 --> 01:16:47.773
Go ahead! What are you trying
to prove to us?

01:16:48.035 --> 01:16:49.957
Once again,
the leader is now Yun.

01:16:50.656 --> 01:16:52.054
You begin following me!

01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:54.324
You have given me
no option.

01:16:55.023 --> 01:16:57.164
I will not
allow men to die.

01:16:57.774 --> 01:16:59.216
You have the advantage.

01:16:59.653 --> 01:17:02.230
I will not permit
any more suffering.

01:17:02.928 --> 01:17:06.422
So, now, our society
is at your disposal.

01:17:14.764 --> 01:17:18.127
Brethren, once again
the Yun family rules.

01:17:18.607 --> 01:17:21.576
It was all worthwhile.
Ha ha ha!

01:17:21.664 --> 01:17:23.280
All hail
the master!

01:17:23.368 --> 01:17:26.949
[All] Hail Master Yun!

01:17:28.609 --> 01:17:30.792
Mr. Yun, sir,
what about the woman?

01:17:31.273 --> 01:17:33.019
- Huh?
- There!

01:17:36.513 --> 01:17:38.042
[Groans]

01:17:38.435 --> 01:17:39.483
Ha ha ha!

01:17:39.745 --> 01:17:42.845
Ah, yes,
you always reminded me

01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:44.680
of a mother hen.

01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:48.961
Except that you look after
a flock of only one.

01:17:49.047 --> 01:17:51.668
Let's see now,
I have something for you,

01:17:51.755 --> 01:17:54.638
mother hen! Ha ha ha!

01:18:04.028 --> 01:18:06.997
[Man] Get her!
Ha ha! Get her!

01:18:07.259 --> 01:18:10.142
You're nothing but
a meddling old woman!

01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:13.461
Ha ha ha!

01:18:23.156 --> 01:18:27.611
[Men Laughing]

01:18:30.188 --> 01:18:33.420
We'll see how many days

01:18:33.769 --> 01:18:37.176
you survive. Ha ha ha!

"The art of nerve blocking."

Here you are,
Sai Yuk.

01:19:18.928 --> 01:19:20.588
Have you heard
from my mother?

01:19:24.911 --> 01:19:28.710
But it's been a month.
That can't be.

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:31.637
Who's there?

01:19:32.729 --> 01:19:34.912
I've come about
your godfather.

01:19:34.999 --> 01:19:36.659
They're holding him
prisoner.

01:19:36.965 --> 01:19:38.581
- And my mother?
- It's bad.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:41.420
She's barely surviving.

01:19:42.336 --> 01:19:43.909
They've hung her
in the square.

01:19:45.525 --> 01:19:47.229
Ma! Unh!

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:49.325
Sai Yuk, you must rest.

01:19:49.543 --> 01:19:51.464
You can rely on the
others to help her now.

01:19:51.552 --> 01:19:54.566
No. The others
are mostly dead.

01:19:55.570 --> 01:19:57.317
Those that have survived

01:19:58.191 --> 01:20:00.505
are being held prisoner
with Mr. Chan.

01:20:01.117 --> 01:20:04.611
Our army does not
exist anymore.

01:20:05.178 --> 01:20:07.362
There is no one left
to fight them, Mr. Fong.

that I want.

But first I want
to watch you suffer.

wouldn't it now?

used to it. Now!

Show me what's left of
your kung fu skills!

01:29:03.544 --> 01:29:04.941
Ha ha ha!

01:29:05.552 --> 01:29:08.347
Come on. You can get up
and show him.

01:29:52.764 --> 01:29:54.598
- We'll beat him together.
- All right.

01:29:54.685 --> 01:29:55.689
I'll kill you both!

01:30:10.931 --> 01:30:12.504
- Do it now!
- Let's do it!

01:30:22.287 --> 01:30:23.509
He'll wear himself out.

01:30:27.965 --> 01:30:29.536
Aagh!

01:30:30.236 --> 01:30:31.502
Come on!

01:30:31.939 --> 01:30:33.075
Which one is
the fatal nerve?

01:30:33.423 --> 01:30:34.865
On the spine!

01:30:35.869 --> 01:30:37.398
Aah!

01:30:38.752 --> 01:30:41.197
It's called the stone dragon,
and it works like this.

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.321
That's it! Good!

01:30:49.409 --> 01:30:50.719
I guess I remembered!

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:15.263
Hyah!

01:31:26.312 --> 01:31:27.753
All right!

01:31:30.461 --> 01:31:33.606
Aah!

01:31:36.052 --> 01:31:37.187
Mother!

01:31:37.275 --> 01:31:39.327
Oh, well,
that wasn't so bad, was it?

01:31:40.244 --> 01:31:42.428
[Both] Well, at least
you could thank us now.

01:31:42.515 --> 01:31:43.695
Thanks.

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:45.354
What are you doing here?

01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:47.931
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

01:31:48.018 --> 01:31:49.722
He shouldn't be sitting
up there like that.

01:31:49.809 --> 01:31:51.905
Oh, he won't be
bothering anybody.

01:31:52.124 --> 01:31:54.700
Well, thanks to us, right?
Let's go.

01:31:57.015 --> 01:31:58.063
Hmm?

01:31:59.198 --> 01:32:01.469
[Horses Neighing]

01:32:02.256 --> 01:32:06.056
[Men Shouting]

01:32:10.248 --> 01:32:11.733
The troops
are coming.

01:32:15.489 --> 01:32:17.323
- Get them!
- Open it up!

01:32:18.546 --> 01:32:22.171
[Men Cheering]

01:32:22.783 --> 01:32:24.136
Sir!

01:32:25.665 --> 01:32:26.844
It's our side.

01:32:48.725 --> 01:32:50.646
Sai Yuk, why don't you
return with us?

01:32:50.864 --> 01:32:53.397
I can't. I've got to be
going my own way.

01:32:54.272 --> 01:32:56.280
Too bad. The society
will miss you.

01:32:56.499 --> 01:32:57.809
[Mother]
Don't worry, Mr. Chan.

01:32:57.896 --> 01:33:00.342
If you need his assistance
for anything,

01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:01.390
you'll have it.

01:33:01.478 --> 01:33:02.788
Thank you so much.

01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:06.369
It looks like you'll have
your hands full as it is.

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:07.679
You said it.

01:33:08.159 --> 01:33:09.906
I want to give you
something nice.

01:33:09.994 --> 01:33:11.828
But I really want for you
to have my gift now.

01:33:12.264 --> 01:33:14.798
- Now!
- But listen, Sai Yuk's grandfather

01:33:14.885 --> 01:33:16.807
gave it to him when
he was just a boy.

01:33:16.895 --> 01:33:19.340
He told me the same thing
about this very one.

01:33:20.912 --> 01:33:22.615
How could the both
of us have--

01:33:23.314 --> 01:33:25.890
I have so many
of these things.

01:33:27.244 --> 01:33:29.341
I'd like you to take one.

01:33:29.909 --> 01:33:31.044
Aah!

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:34.364
- You're very kind.
- Okay. How about you?

01:33:34.844 --> 01:33:37.464
Would you like one?
I've got about a million of 'em.

01:33:37.552 --> 01:33:39.343
We should try to
talk more often.

01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:41.220
[Both] Sai Yuk!

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:43.666
Oh, my.
Well, see you later!

01:33:43.753 --> 01:33:45.326
[Both]
Sai Yuk, slow down!

01:33:47.859 --> 01:33:49.562
I guess I'll see you later.

01:33:50.479 --> 01:33:52.052
Ha ha! Best of luck!

01:33:52.706 --> 01:33:55.239
- [Sai Yuk] They're catching up.
- [Soo Li] What a cheap trinket!

01:33:55.458 --> 01:33:56.812
How many other girls
did you give them to?!

01:33:56.899 --> 01:33:58.166
[Ting Ting] I can't believe you gave us
the same present!

01:33:58.253 --> 01:33:59.737
[Mother] Ladies, wait!

01:33:59.825 --> 01:34:04.542
