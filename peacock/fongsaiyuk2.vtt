00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:12.700
[Mother] The seed falls
and with time,

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.787
is carried far from
the tree that bore it.

00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:19.457
Yet the seed longs
to return...

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:22.710
for the tree...

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:24.546
is filled with memories.

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.548
- Ma!
- Fong, save yourself!

00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:28.341
No way! You need
my protection!

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:36.683
[Mother]
Memories that are joyful

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:39.727
and memories
that are filled with pain.

00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:41.855
Ooh, ow. It hurts.

00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:44.274
It would have been worse
if I hadn't shielded you.

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:45.692
Please, Dad, no!

00:02:49.487 --> 00:02:50.989
I'm coming home! Yeah!

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.202
- Aah! Look out!
- Hey, you look great!

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.121
Aah!

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:02.459
[Mother]
He longs to return...

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:05.003
no matter
how great the distance...

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:06.838
or how barren
the terrain...

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:10.842
because the memory is so strong
and lasting and clear.

00:03:13.052 --> 00:03:17.056
Its images are glimpsed
through time's pallid veil...

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.684
like an apparition.

00:03:20.185 --> 00:03:21.311
Come on, come on!

00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:23.855
Coming unbidden,
a shadow--

00:03:24.147 --> 00:03:26.191
Wait a minute. Unh!

00:03:27.192 --> 00:03:30.111
A shadow,
a whispering wind,

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:31.488
calling his name.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:32.989
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.285
Ha ha! Hyah!

00:03:40.163 --> 00:03:41.831
[Horse Neighs]

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:44.542
[Parade Music]

00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.434
[Chan] Our people have
been looking forward

00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:02.894
to this celebration.

00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:05.939
Ha ha ha! Yes, good.

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.317
[Cheering]

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:12.529
It pleases me to see them
enjoying themselves.

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.697
Ahh. Sai Yuk.

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:17.325
Do you know how lucky
we both are?

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:18.868
This is the way
it should be.

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:21.246
[Waiter] Go away!
We don't allow begging here!

00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:23.831
- No! Go away!
- Sir, it's for the poor.

00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:26.543
- Don't you understand--
- I told you there's no begging here.

00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:27.502
Now go away.

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:28.378
Hey! Can't you--

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.879
Hey, he's with me.

00:04:30.797 --> 00:04:32.715
- Bless you, my son.
- Sorry. I didn't know.

00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:37.512
Aie!

00:04:37.595 --> 00:04:39.305
Only a minute ago
you threw him out.

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.890
- Shall we?
- Fine.

00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:44.394
Ow. My knees.

00:04:50.817 --> 00:04:51.859
What hit me?

00:04:59.242 --> 00:05:01.661
Reverend, there's plenty
to eat, so go on.

00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:03.621
Ah, bless you.

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.332
Allow me the great honour

00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:08.543
of reading
your fortune tonight.

00:05:09.127 --> 00:05:12.839
I foresee that you will lead
an extraordinary life.

00:05:12.922 --> 00:05:14.465
- Me?
- That's nothing.

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:17.093
He already has
an extraordinary wife.

00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:20.054
Yes, I'm sure.

00:05:20.138 --> 00:05:21.973
You will bring him
happiness.

00:05:22.265 --> 00:05:25.310
I foresee that you
will have one boy child

00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:26.519
and one girl.

00:05:26.728 --> 00:05:28.730
- Isn't that wonderful?
- No more?

00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:33.901
I predict a minimum
of two girls and two boys

00:05:33.985 --> 00:05:35.069
for you, sir.

00:05:35.153 --> 00:05:36.404
That's great!

00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:42.118
Wait, sir, do you mean
that I'll--

00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:43.453
Yes, you comprehend.

00:05:43.536 --> 00:05:45.622
- But, uh...
- Mmm!

00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:48.416
Wait! Ting Ting!

00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:50.335
Reverend, help yourself.
I've got to go.

00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:51.544
Ting Ting! Wait!

00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:53.463
Wait! I'm not finished!

00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:54.922
Don't go away!

00:05:55.548 --> 00:05:59.010
I'm afraid my godson
is always in such a big hurry.

00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:01.971
Sir, you beware.

00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:05.141
Your face is clouded
with evil.

00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:07.894
You're mistaken.

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:10.480
No. It seems clear to me.

00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:12.023
Your palm.

00:06:12.732 --> 00:06:15.151
[Chuckles]
All right. Go on.

00:06:17.987 --> 00:06:19.072
Emperor!

00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:24.035
Good sir, why are you
calling me emperor?

00:06:24.327 --> 00:06:25.870
Because I saw it.

00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:29.290
The markings on
your hand are those

00:06:29.374 --> 00:06:32.251
that only one of
the royal line would have.

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:38.383
[Woman] My son, it is no longer
safe for you here.

00:06:39.175 --> 00:06:40.218
You will go to Japan

00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:42.095
to live under
the protection of Mr. Yun,

00:06:42.303 --> 00:06:44.430
leader of
the Red Flower Society.

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:47.100
Your new name
will be Chan Ka Lok.

00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:49.310
Inside of this sacred box

00:06:49.394 --> 00:06:52.230
are documents which prove
your true birthright.

00:06:52.522 --> 00:06:54.148
One day, when it is safe,

00:06:54.232 --> 00:06:56.818
I hope that you will be able
to return to the throne.

00:06:57.068 --> 00:06:59.862
[Shouting]

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.337
Ahem.

00:07:18.715 --> 00:07:20.883
Yes.
You should be cautious

00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:22.051
about what
you tell people.

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:23.636
I'm telling you
what I saw.

00:07:23.886 --> 00:07:25.054
Nothing more.

00:07:26.514 --> 00:07:29.308
I'm...I'm sensing a man

00:07:29.392 --> 00:07:31.602
who is close to you
will betray you...

00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:35.648
yet another person close
will be there to protect you.

00:07:36.107 --> 00:07:37.400
Perhaps save your life.

00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.697
Sai Yuk, when do
we get to be alone?

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.323
I thought
we were married.

00:07:44.407 --> 00:07:45.867
Doesn't seem
that way now.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.870
Don't be silly.
I love you.

00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:52.874
Oh. Then maybe you can
show your feelings.

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:55.251
[Whispering]

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.755
Wait, you mean make
an ass of myself?

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:00.173
They'd laugh
at me.

00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:01.799
They might laugh...

00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:03.634
but I need to
hear it from you

00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:04.552
once in awhile.

00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:06.012
Hmm. All right then.

00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:10.975
If it's a problem,
well, I'm sorry.

00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:12.769
Lay down here with me.

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:15.855
All right, then.

00:08:16.314 --> 00:08:19.066
Good. But don't
make it sound wrong.

00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:21.486
Hmm. All right.

00:08:23.613 --> 00:08:25.323
I love you. Good?

00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:26.824
Let's try it again.

00:08:27.283 --> 00:08:28.367
Can you say it?

00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:31.245
- All right. I love you.
- Oh.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.333
What?
Beat it right now.

00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.418
What he said
was pretty nice.

00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:39.879
I'd like to have
such a good boy.

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:41.088
You're crazy!

00:08:41.506 --> 00:08:42.924
Hey, how about it?

00:08:43.633 --> 00:08:45.176
Sai Yuk, did you
hear what he said?

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:46.385
Knock him out!

00:08:46.469 --> 00:08:47.512
But why?

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:49.931
Because of what he said.
Let's beat him up right now.

00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:52.892
- Mmm!
- Don't try it.

00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:54.685
I'll do it!

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:55.645
Think so?

00:08:55.937 --> 00:08:57.688
Hey, stop it now!
Come on!

00:08:57.939 --> 00:09:00.483
[Both] Hey!
Your dad's calling you!

00:09:01.192 --> 00:09:02.819
See that?
Your father wants you.

00:09:02.902 --> 00:09:03.903
Go on.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.364
There.

00:09:06.447 --> 00:09:07.782
I'll come back again.
You'll see.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.991
See you then.

00:09:09.242 --> 00:09:11.953
- Let's go.
- [Shouting]

00:09:15.373 --> 00:09:16.374
Go!

00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:20.086
They're good.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:28.386
[Clapping]

00:09:44.902 --> 00:09:47.071
[Chan]
Watch out! Reverend!

00:09:50.408 --> 00:09:53.911
Aah!

00:09:56.122 --> 00:09:57.123
Someone, please!

00:10:00.543 --> 00:10:01.794
What happened?
I'll go see!

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.134
[Yelling]

00:10:54.472 --> 00:10:56.140
All right.
Shall we do it?

00:10:56.599 --> 00:10:57.642
[Yelling]

00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:03.416
I'm just waiting.

00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:06.836
Aah!

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:30.151
Hold it!

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.737
It could be a trap!

00:12:33.154 --> 00:12:34.321
Save your strength.

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:36.824
[Man] The meeting of
the Red Flower Society

00:12:36.907 --> 00:12:38.242
will come to order.

00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:39.493
Congratulations.

00:12:39.577 --> 00:12:41.328
You men and women
have done well.

00:12:42.204 --> 00:12:44.165
Now let's hear from
some of our members.

00:12:44.248 --> 00:12:45.541
Who has a report?

00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:48.294
[Man] Mr. Chan, sir!

00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:49.712
Our new fishing rights
agreement

00:12:49.795 --> 00:12:52.006
will take effect
at the start of the month.

00:12:52.089 --> 00:12:53.841
[Clapping]

00:12:53.924 --> 00:12:55.551
[Man 2] The brood mares
have given birth

00:12:55.634 --> 00:12:57.178
to three more colts!

00:12:57.386 --> 00:13:00.389
Ahh, it seems like
it's all good news, right?

00:13:00.598 --> 00:13:03.100
The society is doing
tremendously right now.

00:13:04.185 --> 00:13:06.437
The value of our property
in Shanghai

00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:08.939
has increased three times!

00:13:09.023 --> 00:13:11.108
[Clapping]

00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:13.611
[Man] Sir,
all the good news

00:13:13.694 --> 00:13:14.904
calls for
a celebration!

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.073
[Chan] I'm afraid not.

00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:19.617
Some of our neighbours
have been victims

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.993
of the recent flooding.

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:22.620
We will loan them
some money.

00:13:23.412 --> 00:13:25.331
Wow. I could do
all that, right?

00:13:26.207 --> 00:13:28.542
No, you couldn't.
It'd be too much for you.

00:13:28.626 --> 00:13:31.295
What? Come on.
I'm up to it.

00:13:32.421 --> 00:13:35.049
Mr. Chan, will you honour us
by naming our baby?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.801
Yes, of course.

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.010
Thank you, sir.

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:41.931
He's a handsome boy.

00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:44.600
Why don't we name him
Sung Taian?

00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:48.104
I hope that he will give you
a lot of pleasure.

00:14:00.783 --> 00:14:01.826
Unh!

00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:03.869
Don't kill her!

00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:09.792
She tried
to kill you, sir.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.293
I had to do it.

00:14:12.044 --> 00:14:13.295
Why would Mrs. Leong--

00:14:15.172 --> 00:14:17.299
Look...
it's someone in a mask.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.759
Who could this be?

00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:21.387
Say, that woman
was with you.

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:23.055
What happened
to Mrs. Leong?

00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:25.766
Hey, what are you
babbling about?

00:14:26.183 --> 00:14:28.602
Why don't we ask him some
questions about the woman?

00:14:29.854 --> 00:14:31.981
Sure. Who's behind it?

00:14:32.356 --> 00:14:34.859
He's jealous because his father
didn't appoint him to lead us!

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:36.402
Aren't you, Mr. Yun?

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.029
And so you've become obsessed
with murdering our leader!

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:41.365
- That's a complete lie!
- Prove it! You're a traitor, too!

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:43.909
- [Crying]
- Stop that!

00:14:44.493 --> 00:14:47.454
How can we expect to overthrow
the Manchus when we fight each other?

00:14:47.538 --> 00:14:48.831
We must stand united!

00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:50.374
He can forget it.

00:14:50.833 --> 00:14:53.085
Well, what happens if
we don't come together?

00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:55.212
What? What difference
would it make?

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:58.007
The only good philosophy
would be to stay neutral.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.467
Oh, stay out of trouble,
is that what you're saying?

00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:04.221
Exactly.
You said it. You said it.

00:15:04.305 --> 00:15:06.599
For those of you
who question my loyalty

00:15:06.682 --> 00:15:08.475
to the Red Flower Society,

00:15:09.101 --> 00:15:10.644
I will prove myself.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.106
Hey...

00:15:18.277 --> 00:15:19.778
So I see
you were fighting.

00:15:20.529 --> 00:15:22.698
Your father
was a loyal subject,

00:15:22.907 --> 00:15:27.286
and his son could not be
any less honourable.

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:32.082
I promise that I will
search out this traitor scum

00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:33.709
and I will kill him!

00:15:34.043 --> 00:15:36.420
Father, what happened
with her now?

00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:38.797
- My son, go away.
- Hold on!

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:44.220
Son, you've seen
this woman?

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.139
Yes, sir. Dad was
talking with her

00:15:47.223 --> 00:15:48.974
before the meeting
started.

00:15:51.435 --> 00:15:53.229
Well,
there you have it.

00:15:53.562 --> 00:15:54.688
You shut your face!

00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:02.655
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

00:16:03.739 --> 00:16:05.282
- He's your own son!
- Who are you?

00:16:05.741 --> 00:16:06.867
Who am I?

00:16:07.409 --> 00:16:09.828
Aw, are you saying
that you don't know me?

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:12.498
Well, I am our leader's
favourite relative...

00:16:12.706 --> 00:16:14.625
known as Fong Sai Yuk!

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:16.543
Do you know who I am?

00:16:16.794 --> 00:16:18.712
Oh, yeah.
The boy beater.

00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:19.964
Unh!

00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:21.048
Down!

00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:23.300
What are you doing?

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.302
Do you know who
Mr. Yun's father is?

00:16:25.552 --> 00:16:26.679
He's our former leader!

00:16:26.762 --> 00:16:28.430
Sir. But the little boy was--

00:16:28.514 --> 00:16:30.307
That will be enough!
Mr. Dong!

00:16:30.391 --> 00:16:32.059
Uh, why are you looking
at me like that?

00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:34.270
Give Fong Sai Yuk
some of your knowledge.

00:16:34.353 --> 00:16:35.479
Teach him
our commandments.

00:16:35.813 --> 00:16:37.398
- With pleasure!
- Good.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.024
See that he learns well.

00:16:45.281 --> 00:16:47.491
[Dong] The commandments of
the Red Flower Society.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.495
One. You will not steal
another person's property.

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:54.206
Two. You will not covet
the property of another.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.751
Three. You will not covet
the wife of another man.

00:16:57.835 --> 00:16:59.712
Four. You will
always be truthful.

00:16:59.962 --> 00:17:02.715
Five. Honour our leader
in every way.

00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:05.467
Hey, are you getting it?
I'll start again.

00:17:06.176 --> 00:17:08.887
It's more like
the seven Taoist commands.

00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:10.889
Yeah, that's just
where he got it from,

00:17:10.973 --> 00:17:13.017
and Mr. Yun has
adapted it for us.

00:17:13.392 --> 00:17:14.685
Huh. I thought so.

00:17:15.602 --> 00:17:17.646
[Yun] I see
you're a slow learner.

00:17:20.274 --> 00:17:22.443
Today you insulted me...

00:17:22.735 --> 00:17:24.528
and I'm not
about to forget it.

00:17:25.237 --> 00:17:28.032
It's time you learned
a more important lesson

00:17:28.115 --> 00:17:30.492
from one
who is your superior.

00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:33.579
Who? The one who
hits boys?

00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:35.497
I'd like to
see you handle

00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:38.167
someone
that hits back.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.878
How should
we settle this?

00:17:41.587 --> 00:17:44.506
Maybe your godfather
could come to your rescue.

00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:46.759
No! The book
of commandments

00:17:46.842 --> 00:17:50.012
says to settle this
a different way.

00:17:51.138 --> 00:17:52.306
Fighting.

00:17:53.974 --> 00:17:55.601
Are you ready to fight?

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:56.810
Uh-oh.

00:18:34.223 --> 00:18:35.516
[Yun growls]

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:15.889
[Yun growls]

00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:27.276
Enough!

00:19:27.484 --> 00:19:29.194
Fighting is not
for settling disputes

00:19:29.278 --> 00:19:30.654
within the society.

00:19:31.488 --> 00:19:32.739
We are a family!

00:19:33.073 --> 00:19:34.950
You should save it
for the Manchus!

00:19:35.033 --> 00:19:35.909
I'm sorry.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.204
When someone insults
the Yun name...

00:19:42.416 --> 00:19:43.417
I will fight.

00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:46.170
Be prepared
to do it again.

00:19:50.966 --> 00:19:52.676
The commandments
that you learned,

00:19:53.177 --> 00:19:54.428
did you understand them?

00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:55.679
Uncle, it wasn't me!

00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:57.222
That's enough!
Kneel!

00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:01.435
- Your reason?
- The boy! His own child!

00:20:01.518 --> 00:20:03.020
No one should hurt
a baby like that.

00:20:03.228 --> 00:20:05.397
You are sure
in your convictions.

00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:07.149
It's your actions

00:20:07.566 --> 00:20:09.151
I'm concerned with
right now.

00:20:09.401 --> 00:20:11.862
But am I supposed
to just ignore it?

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.865
Perhaps... yes.

00:20:15.991 --> 00:20:17.409
When it's necessary.

00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:19.661
You think too much
like your mother.

00:20:19.912 --> 00:20:21.580
Maybe you should
go home to her.

00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:26.210
So keep reading.

00:20:26.502 --> 00:20:28.003
I know he wants you
to learn it.

00:20:28.337 --> 00:20:30.088
Anyway,
this part's the hardest.

00:20:30.339 --> 00:20:31.423
Here.

00:20:43.852 --> 00:20:46.355
You know what?
He didn't have to do that.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.608
Maybe we ought to go and
visit with your mother.

00:20:50.025 --> 00:20:51.109
What?

00:20:51.777 --> 00:20:54.279
Well, why wouldn't we?

00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:57.199
I'll tell you all
one thing--

00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:58.700
one of these days...

00:20:59.701 --> 00:21:01.703
I'll do it. Really.

00:21:02.246 --> 00:21:05.123
I'll be... the leader!

00:21:07.543 --> 00:21:09.336
Hey, come on!
Come on!

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:10.462
Yeah.

00:21:11.004 --> 00:21:13.882
Soup. Soup always
has to be made

00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:15.801
with only
the best vegetables.

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:17.553
Madam, someone's here
to see you.

00:21:22.933 --> 00:21:25.060
What's this,
a birthday party?

00:21:25.143 --> 00:21:26.812
Tell me, where's Sai Yuk?

00:21:27.062 --> 00:21:27.980
Why?

00:21:28.188 --> 00:21:30.691
From the Yangtze
to the Kowloon Harbour,

00:21:30.774 --> 00:21:32.359
I've fought them all

00:21:32.442 --> 00:21:34.236
and they call me
the Duke of Hell!

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.654
Duke of Hell?

00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:38.365
I'll show you some hell.
Pbblt!

00:21:43.078 --> 00:21:44.246
Fong Sai Yuk's mother.

00:21:44.913 --> 00:21:46.498
Now, get the hell
out of my sight.

00:21:46.707 --> 00:21:47.874
Where's she going?

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:49.751
Hey, stop her.

00:21:49.835 --> 00:21:51.545
There's just one more thing
I've got to say.

00:21:51.795 --> 00:21:54.089
- Yeah?
- Watch this. Bite me!

00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:57.593
[Yelling]

00:22:02.014 --> 00:22:03.390
Well, how'd you
like that one?

00:22:03.974 --> 00:22:06.643
Madam Fong,
that was a real good one.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.020
Oh, my soup.

00:22:08.604 --> 00:22:09.605
Oh, my.

00:22:10.147 --> 00:22:11.940
Is that for
Master Fong Sai Yuk?

00:22:12.274 --> 00:22:14.359
You bet it is.
See you later.

00:22:16.778 --> 00:22:18.530
I miss my master so!

00:22:19.114 --> 00:22:20.866
Sai Yuk!

00:22:46.058 --> 00:22:49.353
My good sir, I wonder if
you might be able to help me.

00:22:49.728 --> 00:22:51.063
I'm all out of water.

00:22:52.064 --> 00:22:53.106
Ahh.

00:22:58.153 --> 00:22:59.821
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:23:07.663 --> 00:23:09.289
"On the first of the month,

00:23:09.373 --> 00:23:12.542
a band of Japanese samurai
will travel nearby.

00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:15.962
They will have
the sacred box

00:23:16.046 --> 00:23:17.589
in which your secret
is hidden."

00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:21.843
Mr. Lin!

00:23:22.094 --> 00:23:23.178
Yes, sir!

00:23:23.553 --> 00:23:24.513
[Chan] Mr. Wong!

00:23:24.721 --> 00:23:25.931
Here, sir!

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.190
[Dong] I hope he doesn't
want me to go.

00:23:36.942 --> 00:23:40.237
- Mr. Dong.
- I don't think I'm ready yet.

00:23:40.487 --> 00:23:42.614
Take someone on the mission
who is more prepared.

00:23:42.698 --> 00:23:43.699
Calm down.

00:23:43.949 --> 00:23:46.868
Better to name a good fighter
to go on this mission.

00:23:47.369 --> 00:23:48.578
That won't be you.

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:50.539
Who would be
your choice?

00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:54.000
Ha ha!
I say we take Sai Yuk

00:23:54.084 --> 00:23:55.544
because he's always ready.

00:23:56.253 --> 00:23:58.171
That's what I think anyway.

00:23:58.964 --> 00:23:59.881
Fong Sai Yuk!

00:23:59.965 --> 00:24:01.216
Yo! Yes, sir!

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.592
[Dong] Go, Sai Yuk!

00:24:04.803 --> 00:24:07.556
The mission is yours.
Do you accept it?

00:24:08.014 --> 00:24:08.890
I do!

00:24:08.974 --> 00:24:10.767
Some of you
may not come back.

00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:14.479
[All] Huh! All of us
are prepared to die!

00:24:14.938 --> 00:24:16.732
[Chan] Bring back
the sacred box!

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.323
The numbers four and nine.

00:24:25.615 --> 00:24:28.535
Four and nine?
[Laughs]

00:24:28.618 --> 00:24:31.329
[Laughing]

00:24:31.538 --> 00:24:33.123
What is so damn funny?

00:24:33.206 --> 00:24:34.332
Well,
they were laughing.

00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:36.585
Because you've got
the loser's hand.

00:24:36.793 --> 00:24:38.378
- In mahjong?
- Roulette.

00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:39.546
I don't play it.

00:24:39.796 --> 00:24:41.673
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Remember now?

00:24:41.882 --> 00:24:43.633
Oh, yeah. Number six,
I shall not steal.

00:24:43.717 --> 00:24:46.052
Besides that.
You shall bring my girlfriend something.

00:24:46.261 --> 00:24:47.387
I won't forget.

00:24:47.888 --> 00:24:49.181
Bye. Good luck.

00:24:50.182 --> 00:24:52.309
Hyah!

00:24:54.853 --> 00:24:56.104
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:24:57.105 --> 00:24:59.775
Hold on. Let's be certain
that you're safe.

00:25:00.484 --> 00:25:02.444
Take this. It's good luck.

00:25:02.736 --> 00:25:03.695
Yeah, you're right.

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:05.489
We can't just
sit here all day.

00:25:05.906 --> 00:25:07.157
We're on a mission.

00:25:07.407 --> 00:25:09.618
Why are we waiting, then?
Good-bye.

00:25:11.244 --> 00:25:13.538
Stay safe, all right?
Bye-bye!

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.041
Hyah! Hyah!

00:25:23.757 --> 00:25:26.635
Ah, hello!
It's Mama Fong!

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.345
Lei Ling!

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:31.097
What brings you
here today?

00:25:31.306 --> 00:25:32.724
Go on. Go on.

00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:34.434
- My stable.
- [Man] Yes, miss.

00:25:34.518 --> 00:25:35.435
So, what's the occasion?

00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:36.812
I brought soup
for Sai Yuk.

00:25:36.895 --> 00:25:37.854
He's on a mission!

00:25:37.938 --> 00:25:40.482
Right now? But I made
some soup for him.

00:25:40.899 --> 00:25:43.777
I can't believe you brought
his favourite soup all this way.

00:25:44.069 --> 00:25:45.779
Mmm. Looks good.

00:25:58.333 --> 00:25:59.251
What's the matter?

00:25:59.835 --> 00:26:01.419
[Sai Yuk]
Quiet! Hear that?

00:26:27.237 --> 00:26:28.697
[Sai Yuk]
It's the samurai!

00:26:30.615 --> 00:26:32.367
[Man] That woman's
in trouble.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.162
Wait. I've seen
that woman before.

00:26:39.624 --> 00:26:41.084
Hey, there, miss!

00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:43.545
What are you doing?
Get away!

00:26:43.628 --> 00:26:44.838
Hello, Sai.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.006
You know me?

00:26:47.757 --> 00:26:48.800
[Man] The sacred box!

00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:51.761
[Yelling]

00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:01.313
[Yelling]

00:27:37.223 --> 00:27:38.767
They used nerve blocking
to paralyse you,

00:27:39.017 --> 00:27:40.018
but I can undo it.

00:27:42.729 --> 00:27:45.190
Hey! I'm still paralysed
from the waist down!

00:27:45.607 --> 00:27:46.775
Oh.

00:27:51.112 --> 00:27:52.238
I'm sorry.

00:27:52.948 --> 00:27:54.282
Go on.

00:27:56.409 --> 00:27:57.702
I'm not sure how.

00:28:03.917 --> 00:28:05.585
I'll carry you.
Come on.

00:28:05.794 --> 00:28:06.795
Oh!

00:28:50.171 --> 00:28:51.131
[Samurai] Get them!

00:28:51.214 --> 00:28:52.215
Go!

00:29:00.932 --> 00:29:02.684
[gasps]

00:29:12.527 --> 00:29:14.654
Yaah!

00:29:48.229 --> 00:29:50.231
[Samurai] I'm going
to paralyse you!

00:29:52.067 --> 00:29:53.485
Get them!

00:30:21.429 --> 00:30:22.388
Matsuhiro!

00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:24.182
Matsuhiro?

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.518
It's your mother.

00:30:27.018 --> 00:30:29.187
Ma! The box,
right there.

00:30:29.604 --> 00:30:30.814
We need it.

00:30:43.576 --> 00:30:44.911
Yes, sir.

00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:07.642
Still here?

00:31:07.725 --> 00:31:08.935
Still here!

00:31:14.858 --> 00:31:16.317
I'll take that box now.

00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:28.997
All my nerves
are blocked.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.290
Can she do
anything?

00:31:31.249 --> 00:31:33.293
Hmm? Oh, no.

00:31:33.918 --> 00:31:34.794
No?

00:31:35.003 --> 00:31:36.212
I wouldn't know how.

00:31:36.296 --> 00:31:37.422
Oh, come on.

00:31:43.887 --> 00:31:45.013
Hey, he'll do.

00:31:45.388 --> 00:31:47.557
[Buzzing]

00:31:50.435 --> 00:31:51.436
Ai!

00:31:52.562 --> 00:31:55.481
Now, try to get it
into a good position.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.526
Look out. Now blow it
at me hard.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.366
I keep missing.
You do it.

00:32:07.744 --> 00:32:11.456
Your technique needs work.
It's too high.

00:32:13.958 --> 00:32:15.251
[Gulp]

00:32:17.086 --> 00:32:18.046
It's so--

00:32:19.797 --> 00:32:20.673
I missed, huh?

00:32:21.758 --> 00:32:23.384
Sorry. Is it bad?

00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:27.764
Ugh. Tastes like
you'd expect it to taste.

00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:31.142
Hey, watch. It's going
to get interesting.

00:32:32.018 --> 00:32:33.436
Ohh!

00:32:45.865 --> 00:32:47.075
That did it. Let's go.

00:32:50.328 --> 00:32:51.287
- What are you looking at?
- Me?

00:32:51.371 --> 00:32:52.538
Yeah, you.

00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:54.499
Wait. There's something
you can show me.

00:32:54.582 --> 00:32:56.501
All right, I'd be happy to.
What is it?

00:32:57.001 --> 00:32:59.212
Well, how do you
unparalyse the legs?

00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:01.047
Just hit him
in the stomach.

00:33:02.048 --> 00:33:03.174
Oh.

00:33:21.484 --> 00:33:23.861
[Yun] That Fong Sai Yuck!

00:33:29.242 --> 00:33:30.493
It's Fong Sai Yuk.

00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:34.163
Listen, son,
let me do the talking. Me.

00:33:34.247 --> 00:33:35.415
But, Mum, you can't.

00:33:36.624 --> 00:33:37.500
There he goes!

00:33:37.583 --> 00:33:39.127
Following his mother
around again!

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.045
[Laughter]

00:33:41.671 --> 00:33:45.174
I know.
Always her little dog.

00:33:45.758 --> 00:33:47.176
He follows her.

00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:50.930
If you have something to say,
then say it out loud,

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.432
or keep your mouth shut.

00:33:52.807 --> 00:33:54.517
Look at you all
sitting here,

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.312
stuffing your faces while
my son is out risking his neck

00:33:57.395 --> 00:33:58.980
for the Red Flower Society.

00:33:59.063 --> 00:34:02.275
If any of you had an ounce of bravery,
instead of sitting here,

00:34:02.358 --> 00:34:04.402
you'd be out doing
something about it.

00:34:04.485 --> 00:34:06.571
But all I see
are six or seven men

00:34:06.654 --> 00:34:09.157
who, I must say, haven't
shown me a damn thing!

00:34:09.365 --> 00:34:10.616
Shut up!

00:34:10.992 --> 00:34:12.201
On this mission,

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:15.872
why was it only your son
who returned unharmed?

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.041
What of it?

00:34:20.168 --> 00:34:21.878
Does your mother
fight your battles?

00:34:23.463 --> 00:34:24.672
So!

00:34:27.008 --> 00:34:28.009
Simple...

00:34:28.092 --> 00:34:29.761
he fights better
than most of them.

00:34:30.678 --> 00:34:31.596
Understand?

00:34:36.726 --> 00:34:38.519
You want me?
Let's do it, then.

00:34:38.895 --> 00:34:40.772
Only remember
who started it.

00:34:41.105 --> 00:34:43.024
You don't have to fight
this fool for me.

00:34:43.107 --> 00:34:44.609
For once shut your mouth!

00:34:45.568 --> 00:34:46.402
I'm sick of it!

00:34:46.486 --> 00:34:49.364
Mr. Yun...
I'll take care of it.

00:34:49.447 --> 00:34:51.366
- Uh-huh.
- Mr. Chan,

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:53.201
if I might possibly have
a word with you?

00:34:53.284 --> 00:34:54.702
I'm Mrs. Fong.

00:34:54.786 --> 00:34:56.496
Yes. You're
Sai Yuk's mum.

00:34:57.622 --> 00:34:59.957
That's it?
The boy's mum?

00:35:00.333 --> 00:35:03.544
Mr. Chan, all of Han Mei
knows my reputation.

00:35:03.628 --> 00:35:05.088
Don't tell me
you don't know me.

00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:06.756
About all the fights
that I've won?

00:35:07.048 --> 00:35:08.341
Please tell me
you know me.

00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:11.094
You must be joking.
Can't be.

00:35:11.469 --> 00:35:12.804
Son, let's get out
of this house.

00:35:12.887 --> 00:35:14.514
I'm being toyed with.
Good day.

00:35:14.597 --> 00:35:16.224
We have a duty
to the Red Flower.

00:35:16.432 --> 00:35:17.975
Stay here then.
I'll go.

00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:19.685
Hmm?

00:35:21.604 --> 00:35:23.398
I think I've changed
my mind.

00:35:23.648 --> 00:35:25.525
If you happen to be
looking for me,

00:35:25.608 --> 00:35:26.609
I'll be here.

00:35:26.692 --> 00:35:28.653
[Thunder rumbling]

00:35:42.667 --> 00:35:45.253
It's pouring.
You shouldn't be out.

00:35:45.336 --> 00:35:46.629
I have come to visit.

00:35:48.464 --> 00:35:49.674
Ohh!

00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:51.509
Aah!

[Groaning]

00:35:52.927 --> 00:35:55.680
I've brought some presents.
A few trinkets...

00:35:55.763 --> 00:35:58.599
and some Japanese sakémoto.

00:35:58.891 --> 00:36:01.144
Stronger than wine.
Let me help.

00:36:01.227 --> 00:36:03.438
No, wait, no, wait. I'm not sure
I'm up to it.

00:36:03.855 --> 00:36:05.398
I haven't seen this before.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.650
Oh, well,
guess it's all mine.

00:36:07.942 --> 00:36:10.361
But it's immoral!

drink that in here!

Please!
I'm begging--Aah!

00:36:17.785 --> 00:36:18.953
That's right.

00:36:19.912 --> 00:36:22.248
You'd better help me...

00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:24.625
or I might get drunk.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.044
But it's sakémoto!

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.796
We'll both end up drunk

00:36:29.046 --> 00:36:30.882

Don't tell me
you're shy.

You're afraid
it will...

00:36:48.399 --> 00:36:51.736
go too far?

to deserve this?!

I'd seen the last of her

so many years ago!

around to see us.

it once more?

No! Why do you tempt me

Damn fool!

00:37:44.997 --> 00:37:47.041
There's something
about sake.

00:37:47.959 --> 00:37:49.252
The more you drink...

00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:51.712
the more you want.

00:37:53.422 --> 00:37:56.300
All right, then. You have
to do something for me.

00:37:56.384 --> 00:37:57.552
- Huh?
- You...

00:37:57.635 --> 00:37:59.804
Just a minute now.

00:37:59.887 --> 00:38:03.516
I'm not interested
in prostituting myself.

00:38:03.724 --> 00:38:05.768
I'm sure I'll survive
without that.

00:38:05.977 --> 00:38:08.980
Listen, I want you to teach me
the fatal nerve block.

00:38:09.188 --> 00:38:11.857
Shh.

00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:13.943
Shh. Shh.

00:38:14.318 --> 00:38:16.237
But that's
a secret move.

00:38:16.571 --> 00:38:18.281
It won't be
imparted now.

00:38:18.364 --> 00:38:19.615
Maybe you should
hear me out.

00:38:20.116 --> 00:38:22.076
Fong Sai Yuk is the one
who needs to learn it.

00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:23.911
I want you
to show it to him.

00:38:25.204 --> 00:38:27.206
What for?
I mean, why?

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:28.416
Why do you think?

00:38:28.499 --> 00:38:30.042
So the rest of them
who know it

00:38:30.334 --> 00:38:33.296
won't be able to take advantage
of him so much anymore.

00:38:33.963 --> 00:38:34.964
[Snoring]

00:38:35.047 --> 00:38:36.048
Ooh!

00:38:36.882 --> 00:38:39.343
[Rooster Crows]

00:38:39.969 --> 00:38:42.555
[Grunting]

00:38:50.396 --> 00:38:51.606
Hey!

00:38:52.273 --> 00:38:53.441
Keep quiet about it.

00:38:53.649 --> 00:38:54.859
Oh, shut up.

00:38:55.943 --> 00:38:58.112
Ever try good manners?

00:38:58.779 --> 00:38:59.822
Old bat.

00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:07.955
Good morning.

00:39:08.039 --> 00:39:10.041
Lei Ling. Did you
sleep all right?

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:12.251
What are you
wearing?

00:39:14.045 --> 00:39:15.421
I was
practising.

00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:20.176
Hey, I have a question.

00:39:20.551 --> 00:39:24.764
If a married woman
were to, um, to...

00:39:25.014 --> 00:39:26.474
s-sleep with someone,

00:39:26.557 --> 00:39:28.851
a person to whom
she wasn't married,

00:39:28.934 --> 00:39:31.812
but the two of them
were doing it,

00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:34.774
doing it,
well, you know.

00:39:34.982 --> 00:39:36.275
You know what
they were doing.

00:39:36.734 --> 00:39:38.194
Do you think
there's anything wrong?

00:39:38.694 --> 00:39:41.447
Mum, what?
Something so low?

00:39:43.115 --> 00:39:46.243
There's not even a good word
for what she's doing.

00:39:46.911 --> 00:39:49.622
I mean, I just think
sleeping around like that

00:39:49.705 --> 00:39:50.998
can't be forgiven.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.875
I mean,
what kind of woman

00:39:52.958 --> 00:39:54.877
would carry on
like that?

00:39:55.127 --> 00:39:56.671
You know very well
that it's wrong.

00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:58.631
Now, what kind of woman
could this person be,

00:39:58.714 --> 00:40:00.925
sleeping with a man
she isn't married to?

00:40:01.175 --> 00:40:02.510
What was she thinking?

00:40:03.052 --> 00:40:04.929
The whole town should--
they should just destroy

00:40:05.012 --> 00:40:06.305
this little whore
as an example

00:40:06.555 --> 00:40:08.015
so it won't
happen again.

00:40:08.599 --> 00:40:10.559
So, now that
we've settled that,

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.603
do you want to go
to the market today?

00:40:13.688 --> 00:40:14.689
Lei Ling?

00:40:15.064 --> 00:40:16.232
Lei Ling?

00:40:28.244 --> 00:40:29.412
Hey!

00:40:30.579 --> 00:40:32.540
What are you doing?
I'm all naked!

00:40:32.748 --> 00:40:35.543
You should have kept
your clothes on last night.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.294
This is what you did!

00:40:37.795 --> 00:40:39.630
[Gasps]
She's pregnant!

00:40:41.424 --> 00:40:43.884
Wait!
It's not possible!

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.055
Damn it! Get out
of there right now!

00:40:48.389 --> 00:40:51.225
Let me show you what I do to
guys who take advantage of me

00:40:51.308 --> 00:40:53.602
while I'm sleeping,
you lousy little pig!

00:40:53.686 --> 00:40:55.855
- I oughta cut you a new--
- Hey, put that thing away!

00:40:56.063 --> 00:40:59.400
Not until I'm finished!
I'll make you pay for this!

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.026
Aah!

00:41:03.696 --> 00:41:04.780
Listen, think about it!

00:41:05.072 --> 00:41:06.115
Even if something happened,

00:41:06.198 --> 00:41:08.492
it's not possible for you
to get that big so soon!

00:41:08.576 --> 00:41:09.535
Sure,
that's what you say.

00:41:09.618 --> 00:41:11.328
It's got to be
something else.

00:41:11.412 --> 00:41:13.080
There's no way
something like that

00:41:13.164 --> 00:41:14.373
can happen overnight!

00:41:14.457 --> 00:41:16.667
I've heard the same story
a lot of times before!

00:41:16.876 --> 00:41:18.753
You set me up to have
your way with me!

00:41:18.961 --> 00:41:21.005
No, listen, it's got
to be something else!

00:41:21.088 --> 00:41:22.214
Like what?

00:41:22.298 --> 00:41:24.800
I can tell you what it is
by taking your pulse!

00:41:24.884 --> 00:41:26.177
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:41:26.552 --> 00:41:28.763
Gas!
When you're drunk,

00:41:29.221 --> 00:41:30.389
you get gas!

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.767
Ohh!

00:41:38.105 --> 00:41:40.399
[Mandarin] The samurai
have brought me the box...

00:41:43.444 --> 00:41:46.030
so I want all of you
to guard it well.

00:41:46.113 --> 00:41:47.031
Yes, sir!

00:41:47.114 --> 00:41:50.201
[Humming]

00:41:52.369 --> 00:41:53.537
[laughs]

00:41:54.246 --> 00:41:55.581
Sho Soo Li.

00:41:57.917 --> 00:41:59.335
Sho Soo Li!

00:41:59.585 --> 00:42:00.669
Yes, Father.

00:42:01.337 --> 00:42:02.922
What are you
daydreaming about?

00:42:03.756 --> 00:42:04.715
A boy.

00:42:05.007 --> 00:42:06.217
[Mandarin]
Well, that's enough.

00:42:07.885 --> 00:42:09.845
We failed in our attempt
this time.

00:42:10.471 --> 00:42:11.806
Now the leader's ready.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.933
Fong is a problem.

00:42:14.683 --> 00:42:15.893
But we can still do it.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:18.437
Sir, but now
we're under suspicion.

00:42:18.646 --> 00:42:19.980
So what?

00:42:20.439 --> 00:42:22.399
If we're under suspicion,

00:42:22.733 --> 00:42:25.152
I have information
that there's a secret

00:42:25.236 --> 00:42:26.987
about Mr. Chan

00:42:27.071 --> 00:42:29.657
in the container
that the samurai brought

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.825
to the mandarin.

00:42:30.908 --> 00:42:31.909
We'll get it.

00:42:32.201 --> 00:42:34.036
[Chan] I'm concerned
that someone may

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:35.913
try to steal
the sacred box.

00:42:36.747 --> 00:42:37.832
If that should happen,

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.793
then I'm afraid
my chances of ruling

00:42:40.876 --> 00:42:41.877
will be gone.

00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:43.879
Master, the mandarin's daughter

00:42:43.963 --> 00:42:45.714
seems to be fond
of Sai Yuk.

00:42:45.798 --> 00:42:47.174
Why not send him
after it?

00:42:47.633 --> 00:42:48.926
I don't think so.

00:42:50.177 --> 00:42:51.637
It's too dangerous
for him.

00:42:53.055 --> 00:42:55.266
But, sir,
please think about it.

00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:57.810
The mandarin's daughter
would know

00:42:57.893 --> 00:43:00.437
exactly where her father's
secrets are kept.

00:43:00.521 --> 00:43:02.231
Don't you agree
with that?

00:43:02.565 --> 00:43:04.859
You see, sir,
I've composed a letter.

00:43:05.067 --> 00:43:06.443
[Sai Yuk]
Are you here, Godfather?

00:43:08.904 --> 00:43:09.905
Sai Yuk, what is it?

00:43:09.989 --> 00:43:11.240
My mother made some soup.

00:43:11.448 --> 00:43:13.117
[Chan] I have another
assignment for you.

00:43:13.367 --> 00:43:16.245
- Yes?
- Listen, the box was located.

00:43:16.328 --> 00:43:17.204
Good, then.

00:43:17.288 --> 00:43:19.748
That shows that
anything can be done.

00:43:19.832 --> 00:43:20.833
Precisely.

00:43:20.916 --> 00:43:22.251
Except
it isn't finished.

00:43:22.334 --> 00:43:24.169
Right.
What's the mission?

00:43:24.628 --> 00:43:25.713
Here.

00:43:25.796 --> 00:43:26.755
Take a look.

00:43:30.676 --> 00:43:32.636
This is a love letter
from me.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.096
Uh, yes.

00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:36.140
This is just how you begin
your assignment--

00:43:36.432 --> 00:43:37.600
Talking to a woman

00:43:37.808 --> 00:43:40.644
and thereby establishing
some kind of way

00:43:40.728 --> 00:43:42.688
to win her trust,
so she'll help us.

00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:43.772
Understand?

00:43:44.565 --> 00:43:46.734
But, wait. No, no, no.
No, no, no.

00:43:46.817 --> 00:43:48.777
But what--what if my wife
finds out about it?

00:43:48.861 --> 00:43:50.571
Hey, now, don't you
worry about it.

00:43:50.654 --> 00:43:52.031
I mean, who's going
to tell her?

00:43:52.448 --> 00:43:53.657
I suppose.

00:43:53.949 --> 00:43:56.702
But should I pretend
that I'm in love?

00:43:57.411 --> 00:43:58.454
It's up to you.

00:43:58.537 --> 00:44:00.164
I just want you
to get close to her.

00:44:00.581 --> 00:44:01.999
And have sex with her?

00:44:02.207 --> 00:44:03.334
No sex.

00:44:03.876 --> 00:44:05.377
You get my box.

00:44:05.628 --> 00:44:07.046
You're going
to the Mandarin Palace.

00:44:07.338 --> 00:44:08.339
That's where
you'll meet her.

00:44:08.547 --> 00:44:11.133
Is this girl someone
that I've seen yet?

00:44:11.342 --> 00:44:12.468
Yes.

00:44:12.551 --> 00:44:15.054
You will recognise her
when you see her face.

00:44:15.429 --> 00:44:17.514
I hope she won't want
to get married.

00:44:18.057 --> 00:44:20.017
- That would be a disaster.
- [Yun] Mr. Chan,

00:44:20.726 --> 00:44:22.770
what about me, sir?

00:44:24.688 --> 00:44:26.106
I'll volunteer to go.

00:44:26.857 --> 00:44:27.983
Yeah.

00:44:28.525 --> 00:44:29.818
He could take my place.

00:44:30.194 --> 00:44:31.779
But you're not
a ladies' man. Ow!

00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:33.989
Listen!

00:44:34.198 --> 00:44:36.033
He failed on
the previous mission.

00:44:37.034 --> 00:44:38.577
Now it's my turn to try.

00:44:38.953 --> 00:44:41.080
But your father worked
against the mandarin.

00:44:41.288 --> 00:44:42.957
They wouldn't let you in
without a fight.

00:44:43.415 --> 00:44:45.167
Sai Yuk isn't known
to them at all.

00:44:46.043 --> 00:44:47.127
Yes...

00:44:47.503 --> 00:44:48.754
and she really likes him.

00:44:48.837 --> 00:44:50.005
We'll see.

00:44:50.297 --> 00:44:51.799
We'll see.

00:44:51.882 --> 00:44:53.175
I just might succeed.

00:44:53.467 --> 00:44:54.551
You betting on it?

00:44:54.802 --> 00:44:56.595
Certainly. Why don't
we set a wager?

00:44:56.679 --> 00:44:58.305
What is your bet?

00:44:58.681 --> 00:45:00.265
If I lose,
I'll find a way

00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:01.558
to destroy my kung fu.

00:45:02.017 --> 00:45:03.143
All right, then.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:05.980
Don't be worried.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.525
[Soo Li] "A chance meeting
along the riverbank

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.903
and now I have
only fate to thank.

00:45:13.445 --> 00:45:16.407
I long for a word, a glance, a look.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:18.867
I remain your servant,
Fong Sai Yuk."

00:45:20.828 --> 00:45:22.538
Oh, how wonderful!

00:45:24.456 --> 00:45:26.625
[laughs]

00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:45.227
[gasps]

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:46.395
Dad.

00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:54.862
A young man
wants to court me.

00:45:55.654 --> 00:45:57.948
I know that
you'll like him.

00:46:00.367 --> 00:46:02.202
So, who is
this young man?

00:46:02.661 --> 00:46:03.954
Is he a scoundrel?

00:46:04.038 --> 00:46:05.497
No. He's not.

00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:09.710
Well, then, if he wants
to court you,

00:46:10.127 --> 00:46:11.295
he'll have to
prove himself.

00:46:11.378 --> 00:46:12.504
Well, that's perfect.

00:46:18.302 --> 00:46:20.512
Mum, shouldn't I tell
Ting Ting?

00:46:20.596 --> 00:46:21.930
No. There she is.

00:46:22.222 --> 00:46:23.223
Hold this.

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:24.933
Wait.
I don't want it.

00:46:25.017 --> 00:46:25.934
You hold it.

00:46:26.018 --> 00:46:27.227
All right.
Listen.

00:46:27.644 --> 00:46:29.229
Yeah?
What should I do?

00:46:29.313 --> 00:46:30.564
You should just
kiss her, that's what.

00:46:30.647 --> 00:46:31.732
Don't play shy.

00:46:31.815 --> 00:46:33.108
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

00:46:33.567 --> 00:46:35.152
Just go right over there
and give her one.

00:46:35.235 --> 00:46:36.445
- Right here?
- There she is.

00:46:36.653 --> 00:46:37.654
Okay, then.

00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:49.792
Let's get to it, hmm?

00:46:51.794 --> 00:46:54.838
You've come to me
at long last.

00:46:55.672 --> 00:46:57.716
- But we, uh--
- Are you scared?

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.801
Ma?

00:46:58.884 --> 00:47:00.344
I'll fix that.

00:47:01.053 --> 00:47:02.679
Come on.
Don't be afraid.

00:47:03.138 --> 00:47:04.389
You should've
kissed him.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.350
Hmmph!

00:47:08.018 --> 00:47:09.770
She wants you
all the more.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:11.313
What's the matter?

00:47:11.396 --> 00:47:12.439
Nothing.

00:47:13.524 --> 00:47:15.359
You don't want to let
her get away now.

00:47:15.776 --> 00:47:16.985
Better go.

00:47:19.029 --> 00:47:20.322
All right. Unh!

00:47:21.365 --> 00:47:22.366
Ooh!

00:47:28.747 --> 00:47:29.832
That was easy.

00:47:30.499 --> 00:47:31.500
Oh!

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:33.877
Mmm.

00:47:34.128 --> 00:47:36.463
What are you doing?
Go after her.

00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:38.423
What?
You mean...

00:47:39.216 --> 00:47:40.926
You kissed
one of the Buddhist nuns?

00:47:41.802 --> 00:47:44.138
Hey, it could be the first
kiss that she ever got.

00:47:44.221 --> 00:47:45.514
- Now come on.
- Okay.

00:47:45.722 --> 00:47:46.849
She might ask you
for more.

00:47:46.932 --> 00:47:48.392
Ahh! Ahh!

00:47:50.477 --> 00:47:51.979
I must've
scared her away.

00:47:52.062 --> 00:47:53.230
Maybe she doesn't
want me.

00:47:53.313 --> 00:47:55.232
- Oh, stop it.
- Stop what?

00:47:55.315 --> 00:47:56.316
[Soo Li] Sai Yuk,

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.985
do you want to
marry me or not?

00:47:58.068 --> 00:48:00.445
Sure, I do, but there's
one condition.

00:48:00.737 --> 00:48:01.822
Well, what is it?

00:48:01.905 --> 00:48:02.906
That box you have.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:04.783
All right.
I can get it somehow,

00:48:04.867 --> 00:48:06.326
but you'll also have
to prove yourself

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:07.578
in a competition
you'll win,

00:48:07.828 --> 00:48:09.621
and you'll also
declare your love.

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.081
- Deal.
- Bet on it.

00:48:41.028 --> 00:48:42.905
The competition
will soon start.

00:48:44.156 --> 00:48:46.700
The winner
will marry Sho Soo Li.

00:48:47.409 --> 00:48:49.953
The rules are simple,
so now listen.

00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:52.748
Whichever man
retrieves the flowered ball

00:48:52.831 --> 00:48:54.499
from the top
of the bridal sedan,

00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:56.418
I shall proclaim
the winner,

00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:58.545
and then he will also wed
my daughter.

00:48:59.671 --> 00:49:02.174
The true competition
will now begin.

00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:04.051
[Playing fanfare]

00:49:06.345 --> 00:49:08.055
[Crowd] Ohh.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:10.891
Ooh, what
arresting beauty.

00:49:12.893 --> 00:49:14.269
[Soo Li] Where is he?

00:49:17.439 --> 00:49:19.149
She'll make
a fine bride.

00:49:20.025 --> 00:49:20.984
Too bad.

00:49:21.318 --> 00:49:22.694
Too bad
she'll be mine.

00:49:23.028 --> 00:49:24.238
I'll win.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.490
She'll be
my wife

00:49:26.698 --> 00:49:27.950
once I'm
finished.

00:49:28.659 --> 00:49:31.036
Sorry, my friends,

00:49:31.745 --> 00:49:32.871
I'm going to win.

00:49:33.121 --> 00:49:34.373
Contestants, get ready.

00:49:34.665 --> 00:49:35.999
[Men grunt]

00:49:36.541 --> 00:49:37.459
And start!

00:49:37.542 --> 00:49:39.002
[Yelling]

00:50:21.545 --> 00:50:22.963
Kick them!

00:50:35.058 --> 00:50:36.518
[Men Yelling]

00:51:02.878 --> 00:51:04.046
Mmm!

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.697
I told you we'd be late
carrying this flagpole.

00:52:13.031 --> 00:52:15.158
Don't worry. These guys
can't keep us out.

00:52:16.034 --> 00:52:16.993
[Both] What do you want?

00:52:17.411 --> 00:52:19.121
- The girl.
- The kung fu contest.

00:52:19.204 --> 00:52:20.705
- He's too late.
- Am I?

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:24.918
Hmm.

00:52:25.794 --> 00:52:26.711
Ohh! Aah!

00:52:26.795 --> 00:52:28.380
[Laughter]

00:52:33.301 --> 00:52:34.803
Aha! Oh!

00:52:47.482 --> 00:52:48.358
Ooh.

00:52:56.658 --> 00:52:57.826
[Man] Hey!

00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:02.456
Hello.

00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:05.625
- Huh?
- Hey, there.

00:53:09.087 --> 00:53:10.755
Aah!

00:53:11.381 --> 00:53:13.008
[Crowd] Ohh!

00:53:17.429 --> 00:53:18.430
Yeah.

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.103
About time
you made it.

00:53:25.187 --> 00:53:26.188
I'm sorry.

00:53:27.439 --> 00:53:28.356
Have you been waiting?

00:53:29.566 --> 00:53:30.901
So long.

00:53:31.193 --> 00:53:32.277
Bored yet?

00:53:33.987 --> 00:53:35.614
Hey, don't get thrown off.

00:53:38.241 --> 00:53:40.494
Well, men,
have a nice ride down.

00:53:54.508 --> 00:53:55.550
Are you ready?

00:53:55.634 --> 00:53:57.719
I was hoping you were
going to ask me that.

00:54:02.933 --> 00:54:03.934
All right.

00:54:07.646 --> 00:54:09.189
[All] Aah!

00:54:14.945 --> 00:54:15.946
Good, huh?

00:54:16.029 --> 00:54:17.155
Wow.

00:54:17.405 --> 00:54:19.032
Just amazing. Huh?

00:54:24.287 --> 00:54:26.414
I know.
You want me to jump.

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:29.918
Hai!

00:54:30.502 --> 00:54:31.419
- Whoo.
- Let's go.

00:54:33.547 --> 00:54:34.881
Thanks.

00:54:45.392 --> 00:54:46.476
What? Huh?

00:54:46.935 --> 00:54:48.728
- Hmm?
- What's the matter?

00:54:49.271 --> 00:54:50.522
Can't you look me in the eye?

00:54:50.605 --> 00:54:52.148
Ahh. Ready?

00:54:52.357 --> 00:54:53.775
Hey, wait.

00:54:54.025 --> 00:54:55.110
I'm shocked.

00:54:55.193 --> 00:54:56.111
Wait a minute.

00:54:56.194 --> 00:54:57.612
Come on.
Let me explain.

00:54:57.696 --> 00:54:58.989
Have you gone crazy?

00:54:59.281 --> 00:55:01.408
Didn't you think
I'd find out about this?

00:55:01.491 --> 00:55:03.910
- Well, yes, but there's more to this...
- I don't want to hear it.

00:55:03.994 --> 00:55:05.120
...than there seems
to be right now.

00:55:05.203 --> 00:55:06.454
- I'm not going to listen.
- If you'd listen--

00:55:06.538 --> 00:55:07.539
I'm not!

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:09.833
That might've hurt.

00:55:10.041 --> 00:55:11.167
How about this?

00:55:12.711 --> 00:55:13.878
[Crowd] Oh!

00:55:16.172 --> 00:55:17.299
Come on, settle down.

00:55:17.382 --> 00:55:18.300
I'm not done.

00:55:19.217 --> 00:55:20.427
Be sensible.

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:21.469
I will not.

00:55:23.263 --> 00:55:24.681
Why is she bothering us?

00:55:26.308 --> 00:55:27.225
Uh--

00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:30.729
I'll tell you why.
I'm his wife.

00:55:31.688 --> 00:55:32.689
Don't believe it.

00:55:33.356 --> 00:55:35.191
Oh, two can play at that.

00:55:35.275 --> 00:55:36.610
All right.

00:55:37.193 --> 00:55:38.403
Wait!

00:55:50.749 --> 00:55:51.708
Creep!

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:00.508
There must be
a better way.

[Straining]

00:56:10.101 --> 00:56:11.269
Let me at them.

00:56:18.485 --> 00:56:19.778
[Ting Ting] Ohh!

00:56:21.696 --> 00:56:22.864
Ma.

00:56:24.699 --> 00:56:25.700
You asked for it.

00:56:26.242 --> 00:56:27.661
Will you help me
break this up?

00:56:28.161 --> 00:56:29.371
- Who should I take?
- That one.

00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:31.956
- Li, come on.
- Ting Ting.

00:56:32.165 --> 00:56:33.875
- Please, stop fighting.
- Come on now.

00:56:35.085 --> 00:56:37.462
Listen, he's doing--
he doesn't love her.

00:56:37.545 --> 00:56:38.755
Well, I don't care.

00:56:38.838 --> 00:56:40.465
Someone should've mentioned
something to me.

00:56:40.548 --> 00:56:42.258
Hey, you wouldn't have
wanted him to do it.

00:56:42.342 --> 00:56:43.343
- Come on now, Li.
- Let me go.

00:56:43.426 --> 00:56:45.720
Let me go. I'll make you
into a slave.

00:56:45.929 --> 00:56:47.180
Let me see you
try it.

00:56:47.555 --> 00:56:49.224

Please, please.

Hey, take it easy.

00:56:52.185 --> 00:56:54.229
The minute he realises
what kind of woman you are,

00:56:54.312 --> 00:56:55.980
he'll drop her
like an old habit.

00:56:56.064 --> 00:56:57.565
- Whoa now!
- Why?

00:56:57.649 --> 00:56:59.067
Well, it was
for Mr. Chan.

00:56:59.818 --> 00:57:01.319
All right. If you don't
care about her,

00:57:01.611 --> 00:57:03.279
- then go slap her.
- I will.

00:57:03.697 --> 00:57:04.698
Stop.

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:06.866
You want that box?

00:57:07.909 --> 00:57:09.119
Huh?

00:57:09.202 --> 00:57:10.161
All right.
then I'll do it.

away from Sai Yuk.

not you.

Just ask him
if you don't believe me.

Unless you're afraid to.

Hmm?

Why won't you
look at me?

00:57:27.512 --> 00:57:30.432
- But--
- So, I'll jump, then.

Stop it. Why won't you
let me fall?

00:57:50.452 --> 00:57:52.579
[Strains] I won't.
You're my wife.

00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:54.497
I'm supposed to be
your only wife.

00:57:55.123 --> 00:57:57.292
Sai Yuk, save me!

00:57:58.168 --> 00:57:59.085
What?

00:58:04.424 --> 00:58:05.425
[Soo Li] So strong.

00:58:05.508 --> 00:58:06.968
Just like you are
in bed.

00:58:07.051 --> 00:58:08.219
Hmm. Ha ha!

00:58:08.553 --> 00:58:09.971
You took her to bed?

00:58:10.263 --> 00:58:12.515
All right. Let me loose,
and I'll fall, okay?

00:58:13.016 --> 00:58:14.267
What are you doing?

00:58:14.642 --> 00:58:15.852
She's making it up.

Let me go!

an old lady, huh?

00:58:20.565 --> 00:58:22.358
Aah!

Oh, boy. Uhh!

my new son-in-law.

I love you,

The outside world

00:59:59.789 --> 01:00:01.749

to the wedded couple.

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.628

in its tender embrace

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:09.966

sweetness and laughter
as companions.

Whoops. Huh?

01:00:22.812 --> 01:00:24.105
Nothing.

Nothing can--

Lei Ling, I don't want
to hear that right now.

Shall I sing a song
instead?

01:00:30.904 --> 01:00:32.280
I keep remembering

01:00:33.239 --> 01:00:36.284
Sai Yuk reciting
those words to me.

01:00:39.412 --> 01:00:41.164
What do you say?
Shall we?

01:00:41.873 --> 01:00:43.041
What's your hurry?

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.835
I'll keep my end
of the bargain

01:00:45.919 --> 01:00:47.211
as long as you keep yours.

[Soo Li] What do you
really want?

01:00:50.757 --> 01:00:52.508
Me or what's in
your old box?

01:00:52.592 --> 01:00:54.761
What?
You know I want the box.

01:00:56.346 --> 01:00:57.305

Take it, then.

to be in a rush.

Where do you think
you're going?

- To church.
- To eat.

Is that so?

01:01:58.241 --> 01:01:59.867
You used deception on us.

You've fooled us
to get what you wanted.

Now...

I'll take back the box

01:02:08.251 --> 01:02:09.669
you stole from her.

01:02:10.211 --> 01:02:12.422
Is that what she said?
Now, how can that be?

01:02:12.672 --> 01:02:13.881
Why don't you
ask her again?

01:02:13.965 --> 01:02:15.675
Enough of your fooling.

come from, huh?

the box.

then I die.

your own life?

- Save it for some other time.

rather see it burned?

Ah, you want me
to destroy it,

so no one
can learn the truth.

01:06:14.872 --> 01:06:16.832
I must've been blind

not to see
such an ambitious man,

I don't think
you have the box at all.

It's just a model,

01:08:20.956 --> 01:08:23.501
Would you listen to me?
All his nerve endings are intact.

01:08:23.584 --> 01:08:25.002
We can bring
his skill back.

01:08:25.252 --> 01:08:26.587
- Do you mean it?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:29.799 --> 01:08:30.883
[Mother] Sai Yuk.

01:08:31.217 --> 01:08:32.218
Sai Yuk.

01:08:33.969 --> 01:08:34.929
Ma...

01:08:35.221 --> 01:08:36.514
make sure he gets it.

01:08:36.764 --> 01:08:38.307
Ah, so the box
showed up...

01:08:40.434 --> 01:08:42.978
and Mr. Chan is really
the emperor.

01:08:43.062 --> 01:08:44.063
Emperor?

01:08:44.897 --> 01:08:46.023
But that means trouble.

01:08:46.107 --> 01:08:47.691
I'll destroy it
as soon as possible.

01:08:47.775 --> 01:08:48.734
- Hey.
- What?

01:08:48.818 --> 01:08:50.736
Don't you dare destroy it.

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:51.987
This will come in handy.

01:08:52.071 --> 01:08:54.115
[Woman] Li Dong,
open up. It's me.

01:08:56.492 --> 01:08:57.535
I came to warn you all.

01:08:57.618 --> 01:08:58.744
Yun and his men
are on the way.

01:08:58.828 --> 01:08:59.745
That's it.

01:09:00.162 --> 01:09:01.330
- Faster.
- All right. Now hurry.

01:09:01.414 --> 01:09:03.249
- Let's get out of here.
- We have to be faster.

01:09:07.002 --> 01:09:08.295
Unh.

01:09:12.091 --> 01:09:13.259
Have Fong read it.

01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:15.719
The book on nerve blocking.
Thank you.

01:09:15.803 --> 01:09:19.181
They're here. Make sure he reads it all.
Better get moving now. Go!

01:09:21.642 --> 01:09:23.436
- Come on!
- Over there!

01:09:23.519 --> 01:09:24.812
[Man] Surround the house!

01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:30.151
Company, halt! Come out!

01:09:31.944 --> 01:09:33.946
Fong Sai Yuk,
your day has come.

01:09:36.657 --> 01:09:37.950
He won't be needed!

01:09:38.033 --> 01:09:40.453
[Laughing]

01:09:42.621 --> 01:09:43.539
You know what?

01:09:44.123 --> 01:09:45.833
This is your day to die!

01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:47.668
I wouldn't be so sure
about it.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:48.836
Go get him!

01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:08.230
Not too bad, eh?

01:10:08.606 --> 01:10:09.857
Wait until you see
my nerve blocking.

01:10:11.484 --> 01:10:13.819
[Clucks]

01:10:37.384 --> 01:10:40.137
Aah!

01:10:40.554 --> 01:10:42.181
Here, why don't
you take him?

01:10:42.515 --> 01:10:43.599
I'm going back.

01:10:45.226 --> 01:10:46.143
Can you help him?

01:10:47.728 --> 01:10:49.730
- Please.
- I'll try. Who are you?

01:10:49.939 --> 01:10:51.273
We're getting married.

01:10:52.775 --> 01:10:54.527
Please,
take care of him.

01:10:55.611 --> 01:10:59.114
Where is he? Talk!

01:10:59.198 --> 01:11:00.282
Go to hell.

01:11:04.411 --> 01:11:06.038
Hey, are you all right?

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.415
Find him outside, men!
Go get him!

01:11:18.175 --> 01:11:20.344
Aah!

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:22.680
Dong! Oh, my God!

01:11:22.763 --> 01:11:24.557
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.891
[Groans]

01:11:26.267 --> 01:11:27.268
No.

01:11:27.726 --> 01:11:31.146
I must...
have been rusty.

01:11:31.438 --> 01:11:34.316
It's been a while
between fights.

01:11:34.817 --> 01:11:36.151
[Groans]

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:39.530
I should have...

01:11:41.407 --> 01:11:45.369
ohh, I should have
stayed out of it.

01:11:45.911 --> 01:11:47.371
[Groans]

01:11:47.997 --> 01:11:49.790
But you were so brave.

01:11:50.457 --> 01:11:51.500
You saved me.

01:11:53.335 --> 01:11:57.715
Th-that would be
the first time

01:11:58.382 --> 01:12:02.261
I've saved anyone
in a while.

01:12:03.095 --> 01:12:05.598
[Groans] Oh, God.

01:12:06.515 --> 01:12:07.725
Keep my

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:12.271
memory alive.

01:12:13.272 --> 01:12:14.565
Please.

01:12:17.484 --> 01:12:18.611
Please.

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:22.781
I promise.

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:27.494
I won't forget.

01:12:28.829 --> 01:12:30.539
[Sobbing]

01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:43.969
[Footsteps]

01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:50.601
[Yun] I believe...

01:12:53.395 --> 01:12:56.190
this is what
you've been looking for.

01:12:57.691 --> 01:13:01.528
It tells me
a great deal about you...

01:13:02.279 --> 01:13:03.822
the would-be emperor.

01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:06.784
You are powerless
without your followers.

01:13:07.326 --> 01:13:09.286
We have laid waste to them.

01:13:10.287 --> 01:13:11.664
As I will to you!

01:13:15.793 --> 01:13:16.877
Not yet.

01:13:17.586 --> 01:13:20.756
Your fight with me is liable
to be your final fight.

01:13:20.839 --> 01:13:24.385
Well, do you suppose
I'd come without my men?

01:13:25.469 --> 01:13:26.887
Go ahead.

01:13:28.681 --> 01:13:30.182
See what happens
to your men.

01:13:30.766 --> 01:13:32.267
- No. I can't.
- [Men] Kill him!

01:13:32.559 --> 01:13:34.728
Go ahead! What are you trying
to prove to us?

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:36.814
Once again,
the leader is now Yun.

01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:38.816
You begin following me!

01:13:39.233 --> 01:13:40.984
You have given me
no option.

01:13:41.652 --> 01:13:43.696
I will not
allow men to die.

01:13:44.279 --> 01:13:45.656
You have the advantage.

01:13:46.073 --> 01:13:48.534
I will not permit
any more suffering.

01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:52.538
So, now, our society
is at your disposal.

01:14:00.504 --> 01:14:03.716
Brethren, once again
the Yun family rules.

01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:07.010
It was all worthwhile.
Ha ha ha!

01:14:07.094 --> 01:14:08.637
All hail
the master!

01:14:08.721 --> 01:14:12.141
[All] Hail Master Yun!

01:14:13.726 --> 01:14:15.811
Mr. Yun, sir,
what about the woman?

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:17.938
- Huh?
- There!

01:14:21.275 --> 01:14:22.735
[Groans]

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:24.111
Ha ha ha!

01:14:24.361 --> 01:14:27.322
Ah, yes,
you always reminded me

01:14:27.823 --> 01:14:29.074
of a mother hen.

01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:33.162
Except that you look after
a flock of only one.

01:14:33.245 --> 01:14:35.748
Let's see now,
I have something for you,

01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:38.584
mother hen! Ha ha ha!

01:14:47.551 --> 01:14:50.387
[Man] Get her!
Ha ha! Get her!

01:14:50.637 --> 01:14:53.390
You're nothing but
a meddling old woman!

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:56.560
Ha ha ha!

[Men Laughing]

01:15:12.534 --> 01:15:15.621
We'll see how many days

01:15:15.954 --> 01:15:19.208
you survive. Ha ha ha!

"The art of nerve blocking."

Here you are,
Sai Yuk.

01:15:59.081 --> 01:16:00.666
Have you heard
from my mother?

01:16:04.795 --> 01:16:08.423
But it's been a month.
That can't be.

01:16:10.092 --> 01:16:11.218
Who's there?

01:16:12.261 --> 01:16:14.346
I've come about
your godfather.

01:16:14.429 --> 01:16:16.014
They're holding him
prisoner.

01:16:16.306 --> 01:16:17.850
- And my mother?
- It's bad.

01:16:18.767 --> 01:16:20.561
She's barely surviving.

01:16:21.436 --> 01:16:22.938
They've hung her
in the square.

01:16:24.481 --> 01:16:26.108
Ma! Unh!

01:16:26.191 --> 01:16:28.110
Sai Yuk, you must rest.

01:16:28.318 --> 01:16:30.153
You can rely on the
others to help her now.

01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:33.115
No. The others
are mostly dead.

01:16:34.074 --> 01:16:35.742
Those that have survived

01:16:36.577 --> 01:16:38.787
are being held prisoner
with Mr. Chan.

Our army does not
exist anymore.

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.335
There is no one left
to fight them, Mr. Fong.

that I want.

to watch you suffer.

Show me what's left of
your kung fu skills!

01:25:17.389 --> 01:25:18.723
Ha ha ha!

01:25:19.307 --> 01:25:21.976
Come on. You can get up
and show him.

01:26:04.394 --> 01:26:06.146
- We'll beat him together.
- All right.

01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:07.188
I'll kill you both!

01:26:21.744 --> 01:26:23.246
- Do it now!
- Let's do it!

01:26:32.589 --> 01:26:33.756
He'll wear himself out.

01:26:38.011 --> 01:26:39.512
Aagh!

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.389
Come on!

01:26:41.806 --> 01:26:42.891
Which one is
the fatal nerve?

01:26:43.224 --> 01:26:44.601
On the spine!

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.020
Aah!

01:26:48.313 --> 01:26:50.648
It's called the stone dragon,
and it works like this.

01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:58.406
That's it! Good!

01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:59.741
I guess I remembered!

01:27:21.179 --> 01:27:23.181
Hyah!

01:27:33.733 --> 01:27:35.109
All right!

01:27:37.695 --> 01:27:40.698
Aah!

01:27:43.034 --> 01:27:44.118
Mother!

01:27:44.202 --> 01:27:46.162
Oh, well,
that wasn't so bad, was it?

01:27:47.038 --> 01:27:49.123
[Both] Well, at least
you could thank us now.

01:27:49.207 --> 01:27:50.333
Thanks.

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:51.918
What are you doing here?

01:27:53.211 --> 01:27:54.379
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

01:27:54.462 --> 01:27:56.089
He shouldn't be sitting
up there like that.

01:27:56.172 --> 01:27:58.174
Oh, he won't be
bothering anybody.

01:27:58.383 --> 01:28:00.843
Well, thanks to us, right?
Let's go.

01:28:03.054 --> 01:28:04.055
Hmm?

01:28:05.139 --> 01:28:07.308
[Horses Neighing]

01:28:08.059 --> 01:28:11.688
[Men Shouting]

01:28:15.692 --> 01:28:17.110
The troops
are coming.

01:28:20.697 --> 01:28:22.448
- Get them!
- Open it up!

01:28:23.616 --> 01:28:27.078
[Men Cheering]

01:28:27.662 --> 01:28:28.955
Sir!

01:28:30.415 --> 01:28:31.541
It's our side.

01:28:52.437 --> 01:28:54.272
Sai Yuk, why don't you
return with us?

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.899
I can't. I've got to be
going my own way.

01:28:57.734 --> 01:28:59.652
Too bad. The society
will miss you.

01:28:59.861 --> 01:29:01.112
[Mother]
Don't worry, Mr. Chan.

01:29:01.195 --> 01:29:03.531
If you need his assistance
for anything,

01:29:03.615 --> 01:29:04.532
you'll have it.

01:29:04.616 --> 01:29:05.867
Thank you so much.

01:29:06.242 --> 01:29:09.287
It looks like you'll have
your hands full as it is.

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:10.538
You said it.

01:29:10.997 --> 01:29:12.665
I want to give you
something nice.

01:29:12.749 --> 01:29:14.500
But I really want for you
to have my gift now.

01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:17.337
- Now!
- But listen, Sai Yuk's grandfather

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:19.255
gave it to him when
he was just a boy.

01:29:19.339 --> 01:29:21.674
He told me the same thing
about this very one.

01:29:23.176 --> 01:29:24.802
How could the both
of us have--

01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:27.930
I have so many
of these things.

01:29:29.223 --> 01:29:31.225
I'd like you to take one.

01:29:31.768 --> 01:29:32.852
Aah!

01:29:34.312 --> 01:29:36.022
- You're very kind.
- Okay. How about you?

01:29:36.481 --> 01:29:38.983
Would you like one?
I've got about a million of 'em.

01:29:39.067 --> 01:29:40.777
We should try to
talk more often.

01:29:41.319 --> 01:29:42.570
[Both] Sai Yuk!

01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:44.906
Oh, my.
Well, see you later!

01:29:44.989 --> 01:29:46.491
[Both]
Sai Yuk, slow down!

01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:50.536
I guess I'll see you later.

01:29:51.412 --> 01:29:52.914
Ha ha! Best of luck!

01:29:53.539 --> 01:29:55.958
- [Sai Yuk] They're catching up.
- [Soo Li] What a cheap trinket!

01:29:56.167 --> 01:29:57.460
How many other girls
did you give them to?!

01:29:57.543 --> 01:29:58.753
[Ting Ting] I can't believe you gave us
the same present!

01:29:58.836 --> 01:30:00.254
[Mother] Ladies, wait!

01:30:00.338 --> 01:30:04.842
