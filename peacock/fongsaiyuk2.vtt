00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.300
[Mother] The seed falls
and with time,

00:02:12.384 --> 00:02:15.387
is carried far from
the tree that bore it.

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:19.057
Yet the seed longs
to return...

00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:22.310
for the tree...

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:24.146
is filled with memories.

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:26.148
- Ma!
- Fong, save yourself!

00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:27.941
No way! You need
my protection!

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:36.283
[Mother]
Memories that are joyful

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:39.327
and memories
that are filled with pain.

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.455
Ooh, ow. It hurts.

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:43.874
It would have been worse
if I hadn't shielded you.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:45.292
Please, Dad, no!

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:50.589
I'm coming home! Yeah!

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:55.802
- Aah! Look out!
- Hey, you look great!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.721
Aah!

00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:02.059
[Mother]
He longs to return...

00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:04.603
no matter
how great the distance...

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:06.438
or how barren
the terrain...

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:10.442
because the memory is so strong
and lasting and clear.

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:16.656
Its images are glimpsed
through time's pallid veil...

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.284
like an apparition.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:20.911
Come on, come on!

00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:23.455
Coming unbidden,
a shadow--

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:25.791
Wait a minute. Unh!

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.711
A shadow,
a whispering wind,

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:31.088
calling his name.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.589
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.885
Ha ha! Hyah!

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:41.431
[Horse Neighs]

00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:44.142
[Parade Music]

00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:01.034
[Chan] Our people have
been looking forward

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:02.494
to this celebration.

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:05.539
Ha ha ha! Yes, good.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:08.917
[Cheering]

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:12.129
It pleases me to see them
enjoying themselves.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.297
Ahh. Sai Yuk.

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:16.925
Do you know how lucky
we both are?

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:18.468
This is the way
it should be.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.846
[Waiter] Go away!
We don't allow begging here!

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.431
- No! Go away!
- Sir, it's for the poor.

00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:26.143
- Don't you understand--
- I told you there's no begging here.

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:27.102
Now go away.

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:27.978
Hey! Can't you--

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.479
Hey, he's with me.

00:04:30.397 --> 00:04:32.315
- Bless you, my son.
- Sorry. I didn't know.

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:37.112
Aie!

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.905
Only a minute ago
you threw him out.

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:40.490
- Shall we?
- Fine.

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:43.994
Ow. My knees.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:51.459
What hit me?

00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:01.261
Reverend, there's plenty
to eat, so go on.

00:05:01.553 --> 00:05:03.221
Ah, bless you.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.932
Allow me the great honour

00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:08.143
of reading
your fortune tonight.

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.939
I foresee that you will lead
an extraordinary life.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.565
- Me?
- That's nothing.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.193
He already has
an extraordinary wife.

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.154
Yes, I'm sure.

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.073
You will bring him
happiness.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.410
I foresee that you
will have one boy child

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.619
and one girl.

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.830
- Isn't that wonderful?
- No more?

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:35.001
I predict a minimum
of two girls and two boys

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.169
for you, sir.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:37.504
That's great!

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.718
Wait, sir, do you mean
that I'll--

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:46.053
Yes, you comprehend.

00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:48.222
- But, uh...
- Mmm!

00:05:49.765 --> 00:05:51.016
Wait! Ting Ting!

00:05:51.308 --> 00:05:52.935
Reverend, help yourself.
I've got to go.

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:54.144
Ting Ting! Wait!

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:56.063
Wait! I'm not finished!

00:05:57.396 --> 00:05:58.522
Don't go away!

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:02.610
I'm afraid my godson
is always in such a big hurry.

00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:05.571
Sir, you beware.

00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:08.741
Your face is clouded
with evil.

00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:11.494
You're mistaken.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:14.080
No. It seems clear to me.

00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:16.623
Your palm.

00:06:17.332 --> 00:06:19.751
[Chuckles]
All right. Go on.

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:23.672
Emperor!

00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:28.635
Good sir, why are you
calling me emperor?

00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:30.470
Because I saw it.

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:33.890
The markings on
your hand are those

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.851
that only one of
the royal line would have.

00:06:41.163 --> 00:06:44.176
[Woman] My son, it is no longer
safe for you here.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:46.098
You will go to Japan

00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:48.063
to live under
the protection of Mr. Yun,

00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:50.508
leader of
the Red Flower Society.

00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:53.304
Your new name
will be Chan Ka Lok.

00:06:53.697 --> 00:06:55.618
Inside of this sacred box

00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:58.676
are documents which prove
your true birthright.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:00.684
One day, when it is safe,

00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:03.480
I hope that you will be able
to return to the throne.

00:07:03.742 --> 00:07:06.667
[Shouting]

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:23.919
Ahem.

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:28.679
Yes.
You should be cautious

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:29.902
about what
you tell people.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.562
I'm telling you
what I saw.

00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:33.046
Nothing more.

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:37.501
I'm...I'm sensing a man

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:39.903
who is close to you
will betray you...

00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:44.140
yet another person close
will be there to protect you.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.974
Perhaps save your life.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.521
Sai Yuk, when do
we get to be alone?

00:07:51.608 --> 00:07:53.223
I thought
we were married.

00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:54.840
Doesn't seem
that way now.

00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:57.985
Don't be silly.
I love you.

00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:02.177
Oh. Then maybe you can
show your feelings.

00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:04.666
[Whispering]

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:08.335
Wait, you mean make
an ass of myself?

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.820
They'd laugh
at me.

00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:11.523
They might laugh...

00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:13.444
but I need to
hear it from you

00:08:13.532 --> 00:08:14.406
once in awhile.

00:08:14.624 --> 00:08:15.934
Hmm. All right then.

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:21.131
If it's a problem,
well, I'm sorry.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.010
Lay down here with me.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.241
All right, then.

00:08:26.722 --> 00:08:29.603
Good. But don't
make it sound wrong.

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:32.137
Hmm. All right.

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:36.155
I love you. Good?

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.727
Let's try it again.

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:39.343
Can you say it?

00:08:39.648 --> 00:08:42.356
- All right. I love you.
- Oh.

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:46.637
What?
Beat it right now.

00:08:46.855 --> 00:08:48.820
What he said
was pretty nice.

00:08:49.432 --> 00:08:51.397
I'd like to have
such a good boy.

00:08:51.615 --> 00:08:52.663
You're crazy!

00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:54.586
Hey, how about it?

00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:56.944
Sai Yuk, did you
hear what he said?

00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:58.210
Knock him out!

00:08:58.298 --> 00:08:59.390
But why?

00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:01.923
Because of what he said.
Let's beat him up right now.

00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:05.023
- Mmm!
- Don't try it.

00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:06.901
I'll do it!

00:09:06.989 --> 00:09:07.906
Think so?

00:09:08.212 --> 00:09:10.045
Hey, stop it now!
Come on!

00:09:10.308 --> 00:09:12.972
[Both] Hey!
Your dad's calling you!

00:09:13.714 --> 00:09:15.418
See that?
Your father wants you.

00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:16.553
Go on.

00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:19.130
There.

00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:20.615
I'll come back again.
You'll see.

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:21.881
See you then.

00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:24.983
- Let's go.
- [Shouting]

00:09:28.564 --> 00:09:29.612
Go!

00:09:32.232 --> 00:09:33.499
They're good.

00:09:37.734 --> 00:09:42.190
[Clapping]

00:09:59.484 --> 00:10:01.755
[Chan]
Watch out! Reverend!

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.918
Aah!

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:12.281
Someone, please!

00:10:15.862 --> 00:10:17.172
What happened?
I'll go see!

00:10:21.932 --> 00:10:23.811
[Yelling]

00:11:12.332 --> 00:11:14.079
All right.
Shall we do it?

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:15.652
[Yelling]

00:12:23.127 --> 00:12:24.525
I'm just waiting.

00:12:26.708 --> 00:12:28.106
Aah!

00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:52.520
Hold it!

00:12:53.524 --> 00:12:55.228
It could be a trap!

00:12:55.664 --> 00:12:56.886
Save your strength.

00:12:57.324 --> 00:12:59.507
[Man] The meeting of
the Red Flower Society

00:12:59.594 --> 00:13:00.992
will come to order.

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:02.302
Congratulations.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.223
You men and women
have done well.

00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:07.194
Now let's hear from
some of our members.

00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:08.635
Who has a report?

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:11.518
[Man] Mr. Chan, sir!

00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:13.002
Our new fishing rights
agreement

00:13:13.089 --> 00:13:15.405
will take effect
at the start of the month.

00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:17.326
[Clapping]

00:13:17.413 --> 00:13:19.117
[Man 2] The brood mares
have given birth

00:13:19.203 --> 00:13:20.820
to three more colts!

00:13:21.038 --> 00:13:24.183
Ahh, it seems like
it's all good news, right?

00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:27.021
The society is doing
tremendously right now.

00:13:28.157 --> 00:13:30.515
The value of our property
in Shanghai

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:33.135
has increased three times!

00:13:33.223 --> 00:13:35.407
[Clapping]

00:13:36.018 --> 00:13:38.028
[Man] Sir,
all the good news

00:13:38.114 --> 00:13:39.381
calls for
a celebration!

00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:41.653
[Chan] I'm afraid not.

00:13:42.132 --> 00:13:44.317
Some of our neighbours
have been victims

00:13:44.403 --> 00:13:45.757
of the recent flooding.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.461
We will loan them
some money.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.300
Wow. I could do
all that, right?

00:13:51.217 --> 00:13:53.662
No, you couldn't.
It'd be too much for you.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.545
What? Come on.
I'm up to it.

00:13:57.724 --> 00:14:00.476
Mr. Chan, will you honour us
by naming our baby?

00:14:01.262 --> 00:14:02.310
Yes, of course.

00:14:02.397 --> 00:14:03.576
Thank you, sir.

00:14:06.415 --> 00:14:07.682
He's a handsome boy.

00:14:07.944 --> 00:14:10.477
Why don't we name him
Sung Taian?

00:14:11.219 --> 00:14:14.146
I hope that he will give you
a lot of pleasure.

00:14:27.422 --> 00:14:28.514
Unh!

00:14:29.475 --> 00:14:30.654
Don't kill her!

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.856
She tried
to kill you, sir.

00:14:37.074 --> 00:14:38.428
I had to do it.

00:14:39.214 --> 00:14:40.524
Why would Mrs. Leong--

00:14:42.489 --> 00:14:44.717
Look...
it's someone in a mask.

00:14:45.241 --> 00:14:46.245
Who could this be?

00:14:46.813 --> 00:14:48.997
Say, that woman
was with you.

00:14:49.303 --> 00:14:50.744
What happened
to Mrs. Leong?

00:14:51.486 --> 00:14:53.583
Hey, what are you
babbling about?

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.552
Why don't we ask him some
questions about the woman?

00:14:57.863 --> 00:15:00.090
Sure. Who's behind it?

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:03.104
He's jealous because his father
didn't appoint him to lead us!

00:15:03.191 --> 00:15:04.720
Aren't you, Mr. Yun?

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:07.470
And so you've become obsessed
with murdering our leader!

00:15:07.558 --> 00:15:09.917
- That's a complete lie!
- Prove it! You're a traitor, too!

00:15:10.003 --> 00:15:12.580
- [Crying]
- Stop that!

00:15:13.192 --> 00:15:16.292
How can we expect to overthrow
the Manchus when we fight each other?

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.734
We must stand united!

00:15:18.258 --> 00:15:19.350
He can forget it.

00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:22.189
Well, what happens if
we don't come together?

00:15:22.451 --> 00:15:24.416
What? What difference
would it make?

00:15:24.678 --> 00:15:27.343
The only good philosophy
would be to stay neutral.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.919
Oh, stay out of trouble,
is that what you're saying?

00:15:30.007 --> 00:15:33.850
Exactly.
You said it. You said it.

00:15:33.937 --> 00:15:36.340
For those of you
who question my loyalty

00:15:36.426 --> 00:15:38.304
to the Red Flower Society,

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:40.575
I will prove myself.

00:15:43.021 --> 00:15:44.200
Hey...

00:15:48.568 --> 00:15:50.140
So I see
you were fighting.

00:15:50.926 --> 00:15:53.197
Your father
was a loyal subject,

00:15:53.416 --> 00:15:58.001
and his son could not be
any less honourable.

00:15:59.617 --> 00:16:03.023
I promise that I will
search out this traitor scum

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.727
and I will kill him!

00:16:05.077 --> 00:16:07.566
Father, what happened
with her now?

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.055
- My son, go away.
- Hold on!

00:16:13.156 --> 00:16:15.733
Son, you've seen
this woman?

00:16:15.995 --> 00:16:18.790
Yes, sir. Dad was
talking with her

00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:20.711
before the meeting
started.

00:16:23.288 --> 00:16:25.167
Well,
there you have it.

00:16:25.515 --> 00:16:26.695
You shut your face!

00:16:32.809 --> 00:16:35.037
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

00:16:36.172 --> 00:16:37.788
- He's your own son!
- Who are you?

00:16:38.268 --> 00:16:39.447
Who am I?

00:16:40.015 --> 00:16:42.548
Aw, are you saying
that you don't know me?

00:16:42.811 --> 00:16:45.344
Well, I am our leader's
favourite relative...

00:16:45.562 --> 00:16:47.571
known as Fong Sai Yuk!

00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:49.579
Do you know who I am?

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.851
Oh, yeah.
The boy beater.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.162
Unh!

00:16:53.248 --> 00:16:54.297
Down!

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:56.655
What are you doing?

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.751
Do you know who
Mr. Yun's father is?

00:16:59.013 --> 00:17:00.193
He's our former leader!

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.026
Sir. But the little boy was--

00:17:02.114 --> 00:17:03.992
That will be enough!
Mr. Dong!

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.826
Uh, why are you looking
at me like that?

00:17:06.394 --> 00:17:08.142
Give Fong Sai Yuk
some of your knowledge.

00:17:08.229 --> 00:17:09.408
Teach him
our commandments.

00:17:09.757 --> 00:17:11.417
- With pleasure!
- Good.

00:17:11.723 --> 00:17:13.120
See that he learns well.

00:17:19.672 --> 00:17:21.986
[Dong] The commandments of
the Red Flower Society.

00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:26.178
One. You will not steal
another person's property.

00:17:26.265 --> 00:17:29.017
Two. You will not covet
the property of another.

00:17:29.629 --> 00:17:32.729
Three. You will not covet
the wife of another man.

00:17:32.817 --> 00:17:34.783
Four. You will
always be truthful.

00:17:35.044 --> 00:17:37.927
Five. Honour our leader
in every way.

00:17:38.495 --> 00:17:40.809
Hey, are you getting it?
I'll start again.

00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:44.390
It's more like
the seven Taoist commands.

00:17:44.478 --> 00:17:46.486
Yeah, that's just
where he got it from,

00:17:46.574 --> 00:17:48.714
and Mr. Yun has
adapted it for us.

00:17:49.107 --> 00:17:50.461
Huh. I thought so.

00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:53.562
[Yun] I see
you're a slow learner.

00:17:56.313 --> 00:17:58.585
Today you insulted me...

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.768
and I'm not
about to forget it.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.437
It's time you learned
a more important lesson

00:18:04.524 --> 00:18:07.013
from one
who is your superior.

00:18:07.494 --> 00:18:10.245
Who? The one who
hits boys?

00:18:10.813 --> 00:18:12.254
I'd like to
see you handle

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:15.050
someone
that hits back.

00:18:16.403 --> 00:18:17.888
How should
we settle this?

00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:21.687
Maybe your godfather
could come to your rescue.

00:18:21.906 --> 00:18:24.046
No! The book
of commandments

00:18:24.133 --> 00:18:27.453
says to settle this
a different way.

00:18:28.632 --> 00:18:29.855
Fighting.

00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:33.305
Are you ready to fight?

00:18:33.523 --> 00:18:34.571
Uh-oh.

00:19:13.747 --> 00:19:15.101
[Yun growls]

00:19:55.586 --> 00:19:57.376
[Yun growls]

00:20:08.295 --> 00:20:09.300
Enough!

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:11.308
Fighting is not
for settling disputes

00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:12.837
within the society.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.020
We are a family!

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.335
You should save it
for the Manchus!

00:20:17.422 --> 00:20:18.340
I'm sorry.

00:20:18.602 --> 00:20:21.790
When someone insults
the Yun name...

00:20:25.153 --> 00:20:26.201
I will fight.

00:20:26.638 --> 00:20:29.084
Be prepared
to do it again.

00:20:34.106 --> 00:20:35.897
The commandments
that you learned,

00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:37.731
did you understand them?

00:20:37.949 --> 00:20:39.041
Uncle, it wasn't me!

00:20:39.128 --> 00:20:40.657
That's enough!
Kneel!

00:20:42.405 --> 00:20:45.068
- Your reason?
- The boy! His own child!

00:20:45.155 --> 00:20:46.728
No one should hurt
a baby like that.

00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:49.217
You are sure
in your convictions.

00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:51.052
It's your actions

00:20:51.488 --> 00:20:53.148
I'm concerned with
right now.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.987
But am I supposed
to just ignore it?

00:20:56.205 --> 00:20:59.131
Perhaps... yes.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.795
When it's necessary.

00:21:02.363 --> 00:21:04.153
You think too much
like your mother.

00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:06.163
Maybe you should
go home to her.

00:21:09.263 --> 00:21:11.011
So keep reading.

00:21:11.317 --> 00:21:12.888
I know he wants you
to learn it.

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:15.072
Anyway,
this part's the hardest.

00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:16.469
Here.

00:21:29.484 --> 00:21:32.105
You know what?
He didn't have to do that.

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:35.511
Maybe we ought to go and
visit with your mother.

00:21:35.948 --> 00:21:37.083
What?

00:21:37.783 --> 00:21:40.402
Well, why wouldn't we?

00:21:41.713 --> 00:21:43.460
I'll tell you all
one thing--

00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:45.032
one of these days...

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.176
I'll do it. Really.

00:21:48.745 --> 00:21:51.757
I'll be... the leader!

00:21:54.291 --> 00:21:56.169
Hey, come on!
Come on!

00:21:56.256 --> 00:21:57.348
Yeah.

00:21:57.915 --> 00:22:00.929
Soup. Soup always
has to be made

00:22:01.017 --> 00:22:02.939
with only
the best vegetables.

00:22:03.025 --> 00:22:04.773
Madam, someone's here
to see you.

00:22:10.407 --> 00:22:12.634
What's this,
a birthday party?

00:22:12.721 --> 00:22:14.468
Tell me, where's Sai Yuk?

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.691
Why?

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:18.530
From the Yangtze
to the Kowloon Harbour,

00:22:18.617 --> 00:22:20.277
I've fought them all

00:22:20.364 --> 00:22:22.242
and they call me
the Duke of Hell!

00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:23.727
Duke of Hell?

00:22:24.164 --> 00:22:26.566
I'll show you some hell.
Pbblt!

00:22:31.501 --> 00:22:32.724
Fong Sai Yuk's mother.

00:22:33.422 --> 00:22:35.082
Now, get the hell
out of my sight.

00:22:35.301 --> 00:22:36.523
Where's she going?

00:22:36.873 --> 00:22:38.488
Hey, stop her.

00:22:38.576 --> 00:22:40.367
There's just one more thing
I've got to say.

00:22:40.629 --> 00:22:43.031
- Yeah?
- Watch this. Bite me!

00:22:43.336 --> 00:22:46.700
[Yelling]

00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:52.770
Well, how'd you
like that one?

00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:56.176
Madam Fong,
that was a real good one.

00:22:56.613 --> 00:22:57.618
Oh, my soup.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.278
Oh, my.

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:01.723
Is that for
Master Fong Sai Yuk?

00:23:02.073 --> 00:23:04.256
You bet it is.
See you later.

00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:08.623
I miss my master so!

00:23:09.235 --> 00:23:11.069
Sai Yuk!

00:23:37.448 --> 00:23:40.899
My good sir, I wonder if
you might be able to help me.

00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:42.689
I'm all out of water.

00:23:43.737 --> 00:23:44.829
Ahh.

00:23:50.113 --> 00:23:51.860
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:01.774
"On the first of the month,

00:24:01.862 --> 00:24:05.180
a band of Japanese samurai
will travel nearby.

00:24:06.361 --> 00:24:08.762
They will have
the sacred box

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.465
in which your secret
is hidden."

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:14.920
Mr. Lin!

00:24:15.183 --> 00:24:16.318
Yes, sir!

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.715
[Chan] Mr. Wong!

00:24:17.933 --> 00:24:19.200
Here, sir!

00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:28.896
[Dong] I hope he doesn't
want me to go.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.180
- Mr. Dong.
- I don't think I'm ready yet.

00:24:34.442 --> 00:24:36.669
Take someone on the mission
who is more prepared.

00:24:36.757 --> 00:24:37.806
Calm down.

00:24:38.067 --> 00:24:41.124
Better to name a good fighter
to go on this mission.

00:24:41.648 --> 00:24:42.914
That won't be you.

00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:44.968
Who would be
your choice?

00:24:45.753 --> 00:24:48.592
Ha ha!
I say we take Sai Yuk

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.209
because he's always ready.

00:24:50.951 --> 00:24:52.959
That's what I think anyway.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.750
Fong Sai Yuk!

00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:56.148
Yo! Yes, sir!

00:24:56.498 --> 00:24:57.589
[Dong] Go, Sai Yuk!

00:24:59.904 --> 00:25:02.787
The mission is yours.
Do you accept it?

00:25:03.266 --> 00:25:04.184
I do!

00:25:04.272 --> 00:25:06.149
Some of you
may not come back.

00:25:06.455 --> 00:25:10.036
[All] Huh! All of us
are prepared to die!

00:25:10.517 --> 00:25:12.395
[Chan] Bring back
the sacred box!

00:25:19.775 --> 00:25:21.391
The numbers four and nine.

00:25:21.697 --> 00:25:24.754
Four and nine?
[Laughs]

00:25:24.841 --> 00:25:27.680
[Laughing]

00:25:27.899 --> 00:25:29.558
What is so damn funny?

00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:30.824
Well,
they were laughing.

00:25:31.087 --> 00:25:33.184
Because you've got
the loser's hand.

00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:35.061
- In mahjong?
- Roulette.

00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:36.284
I don't play it.

00:25:36.546 --> 00:25:38.511
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Remember now?

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.564
Oh, yeah. Number six,
I shall not steal.

00:25:40.652 --> 00:25:43.097
Besides that.
You shall bring my girlfriend something.

00:25:43.315 --> 00:25:44.495
I won't forget.

00:25:45.019 --> 00:25:46.373
Bye. Good luck.

00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.648
Hyah!

00:25:52.312 --> 00:25:53.622
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.466
Hold on. Let's be certain
that you're safe.

00:25:58.209 --> 00:26:00.261
Take this. It's good luck.

00:26:00.567 --> 00:26:01.571
Yeah, you're right.

00:26:01.659 --> 00:26:03.450
We can't just
sit here all day.

00:26:03.886 --> 00:26:05.196
We're on a mission.

00:26:05.458 --> 00:26:07.773
Why are we waiting, then?
Good-bye.

00:26:09.476 --> 00:26:11.878
Stay safe, all right?
Bye-bye!

00:26:12.445 --> 00:26:14.499
Hyah! Hyah!

00:26:22.578 --> 00:26:25.592
Ah, hello!
It's Mama Fong!

00:26:25.985 --> 00:26:27.383
Lei Ling!

00:26:28.779 --> 00:26:30.264
What brings you
here today?

00:26:30.483 --> 00:26:31.968
Go on. Go on.

00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:33.758
- My stable.
- [Man] Yes, miss.

00:26:33.846 --> 00:26:34.807
So, what's the occasion?

00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:36.248
I brought soup
for Sai Yuk.

00:26:36.335 --> 00:26:37.340
He's on a mission!

00:26:37.428 --> 00:26:40.091
Right now? But I made
some soup for him.

00:26:40.528 --> 00:26:43.542
I can't believe you brought
his favourite soup all this way.

00:26:43.847 --> 00:26:45.638
Mmm. Looks good.

00:26:58.784 --> 00:26:59.745
What's the matter?

00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:02.015
[Sai Yuk]
Quiet! Hear that?

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.578
[Sai Yuk]
It's the samurai!

00:27:32.587 --> 00:27:34.421
[Man] That woman's
in trouble.

00:27:36.037 --> 00:27:38.395
Wait. I've seen
that woman before.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.549
Hey, there, miss!

00:27:44.859 --> 00:27:46.126
What are you doing?
Get away!

00:27:46.213 --> 00:27:47.480
Hello, Sai.

00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:48.703
You know me?

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:51.629
[Man] The sacred box!

00:27:52.983 --> 00:27:54.729
[Yelling]

00:28:02.635 --> 00:28:04.731
[Yelling]

00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:43.950
They used nerve blocking
to paralyse you,

00:28:44.212 --> 00:28:45.260
but I can undo it.

00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:50.676
Hey! I'm still paralysed
from the waist down!

00:28:51.112 --> 00:28:52.335
Oh.

00:28:56.877 --> 00:28:58.056
I'm sorry.

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:00.196
Go on.

00:29:02.423 --> 00:29:03.777
I'm not sure how.

00:29:10.285 --> 00:29:12.032
I'll carry you.
Come on.

00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:13.299
Oh!

00:29:58.719 --> 00:29:59.724
[Samurai] Get them!

00:29:59.811 --> 00:30:00.859
Go!

00:30:09.987 --> 00:30:11.821
[gasps]

00:30:22.128 --> 00:30:24.355
Yaah!

00:30:59.512 --> 00:31:01.609
[Samurai] I'm going
to paralyse you!

00:31:03.531 --> 00:31:05.016
Get them!

00:31:34.277 --> 00:31:35.281
Matsuhiro!

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:37.159
Matsuhiro?

00:31:38.121 --> 00:31:39.606
It's your mother.

00:31:40.129 --> 00:31:42.400
Ma! The box,
right there.

00:31:42.837 --> 00:31:44.104
We need it.

00:31:57.467 --> 00:31:58.865
Yes, sir.

00:32:21.575 --> 00:32:22.667
Still here?

00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:24.021
Still here!

00:32:30.223 --> 00:32:31.751
I'll take that box now.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.029
All my nerves
are blocked.

00:32:45.115 --> 00:32:46.383
Can she do
anything?

00:32:47.387 --> 00:32:49.527
Hmm? Oh, no.

00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:51.099
No?

00:32:51.318 --> 00:32:52.584
I wouldn't know how.

00:32:52.672 --> 00:32:53.851
Oh, come on.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.799
Hey, he'll do.

00:33:02.192 --> 00:33:04.463
[Buzzing]

00:33:07.477 --> 00:33:08.525
Ai!

00:33:09.704 --> 00:33:12.761
Now, try to get it
into a good position.

00:33:12.979 --> 00:33:15.949
Look out. Now blow it
at me hard.

00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:23.111
I keep missing.
You do it.

00:33:25.601 --> 00:33:29.488
Your technique needs work.
It's too high.

00:33:32.108 --> 00:33:33.462
[Gulp]

00:33:35.384 --> 00:33:36.389
It's so--

00:33:38.222 --> 00:33:39.140
I missed, huh?

00:33:40.276 --> 00:33:41.978
Sorry. Is it bad?

00:33:42.197 --> 00:33:46.565
Ugh. Tastes like
you'd expect it to taste.

00:33:47.263 --> 00:33:50.102
Hey, watch. It's going
to get interesting.

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:52.504
Ohh!

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:06.786
That did it. Let's go.

00:34:10.192 --> 00:34:11.196
- What are you looking at?
- Me?

00:34:11.284 --> 00:34:12.506
Yeah, you.

00:34:12.769 --> 00:34:14.559
Wait. There's something
you can show me.

00:34:14.646 --> 00:34:16.656
All right, I'd be happy to.
What is it?

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.495
Well, how do you
unparalyse the legs?

00:34:19.843 --> 00:34:21.416
Just hit him
in the stomach.

00:34:22.464 --> 00:34:23.643
Oh.

00:34:42.816 --> 00:34:45.305
[Yun] That Fong Sai Yuck!

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.250
It's Fong Sai Yuk.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:56.092
Listen, son,
let me do the talking. Me.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.403
But, Mum, you can't.

00:34:58.669 --> 00:34:59.587
There he goes!

00:34:59.674 --> 00:35:01.290
Following his mother
around again!

00:35:01.377 --> 00:35:03.299
[Laughter]

00:35:03.954 --> 00:35:07.622
I know.
Always her little dog.

00:35:08.234 --> 00:35:09.719
He follows her.

00:35:11.117 --> 00:35:13.650
If you have something to say,
then say it out loud,

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.222
or keep your mouth shut.

00:35:15.615 --> 00:35:17.406
Look at you all
sitting here,

00:35:17.492 --> 00:35:20.332
stuffing your faces while
my son is out risking his neck

00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:22.079
for the Red Flower Society.

00:35:22.166 --> 00:35:25.529
If any of you had an ounce of bravery,
instead of sitting here,

00:35:25.616 --> 00:35:27.756
you'd be out doing
something about it.

00:35:27.843 --> 00:35:30.028
But all I see
are six or seven men

00:35:30.114 --> 00:35:32.735
who, I must say, haven't
shown me a damn thing!

00:35:32.953 --> 00:35:34.263
Shut up!

00:35:34.657 --> 00:35:35.923
On this mission,

00:35:36.142 --> 00:35:39.767
why was it only your son
who returned unharmed?

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.038
What of it?

00:35:44.265 --> 00:35:46.056
Does your mother
fight your battles?

00:35:47.715 --> 00:35:48.981
So!

00:35:51.428 --> 00:35:52.476
Simple...

00:35:52.563 --> 00:35:54.310
he fights better
than most of them.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.232
Understand?

00:36:01.603 --> 00:36:03.481
You want me?
Let's do it, then.

00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:05.840
Only remember
who started it.

00:36:06.189 --> 00:36:08.198
You don't have to fight
this fool for me.

00:36:08.285 --> 00:36:09.858
For once shut your mouth!

00:36:10.862 --> 00:36:11.735
I'm sick of it!

00:36:11.823 --> 00:36:14.837
Mr. Yun...
I'll take care of it.

00:36:14.924 --> 00:36:16.933
- Uh-huh.
- Mr. Chan,

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.855
if I might possibly have
a word with you?

00:36:18.942 --> 00:36:20.426
I'm Mrs. Fong.

00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:22.305
Yes. You're
Sai Yuk's mum.

00:36:23.484 --> 00:36:25.929
That's it?
The boy's mum?

00:36:26.323 --> 00:36:29.685
Mr. Chan, all of Han Mei
knows my reputation.

00:36:29.773 --> 00:36:31.302
Don't tell me
you don't know me.

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:33.048
About all the fights
that I've won?

00:36:33.354 --> 00:36:34.708
Please tell me
you know me.

00:36:35.232 --> 00:36:37.591
You must be joking.
Can't be.

00:36:37.984 --> 00:36:39.381
Son, let's get out
of this house.

00:36:39.468 --> 00:36:41.172
I'm being toyed with.
Good day.

00:36:41.259 --> 00:36:42.963
We have a duty
to the Red Flower.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.796
Stay here then.
I'll go.

00:36:45.539 --> 00:36:46.587
Hmm?

00:36:48.596 --> 00:36:50.475
I think I've changed
my mind.

00:36:50.736 --> 00:36:52.702
If you happen to be
looking for me,

00:36:52.789 --> 00:36:53.837
I'll be here.

00:36:53.924 --> 00:36:55.977
[Thunder rumbling]

00:37:10.652 --> 00:37:13.359
It's pouring.
You shouldn't be out.

00:37:13.446 --> 00:37:14.800
I have come to visit.

00:37:16.722 --> 00:37:17.989
Ohh!

00:37:18.687 --> 00:37:19.910
Aah!

00:37:19.997 --> 00:37:21.308
[Groaning]

00:37:21.395 --> 00:37:24.278
I've brought some presents.
A few trinkets...

00:37:24.365 --> 00:37:27.334
and some Japanese sakémoto.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.999
Stronger than wine.
Let me help.

00:37:30.086 --> 00:37:32.401
No, wait, no, wait. I'm not sure
I'm up to it.

00:37:32.838 --> 00:37:34.454
I haven't seen this before.

00:37:35.021 --> 00:37:36.812
Oh, well,
guess it's all mine.

00:37:37.118 --> 00:37:39.651
But it's immoral!
Listen to what I'm saying!

drink that in here!

Please!
I'm begging--Aah!

00:37:47.424 --> 00:37:48.647
That's right.

00:37:49.652 --> 00:37:52.098
You'd better help me...

00:37:53.059 --> 00:37:54.587
or I might get drunk.

00:37:55.461 --> 00:37:57.120
But it's sakémoto!

00:37:57.513 --> 00:37:58.954
We'll both end up drunk

00:37:59.216 --> 00:38:01.139
and you don't want--
Ohh!

Don't tell me
you're shy.

00:38:17.079 --> 00:38:18.783
You're afraid
it will...

00:38:19.481 --> 00:38:22.975
go too far?

[Giggles]

00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:30.443
What have I done
to deserve this?!

I'd seen the last of her

so many years ago!

to stop me.

around to see us.

Perhaps if we shared
it once more?

No! Why do you tempt me

00:39:10.929 --> 00:39:12.894

Damn fool!

00:39:18.746 --> 00:39:20.886
There's something
about sake.

00:39:21.847 --> 00:39:23.201
The more you drink...

00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:25.777
the more you want.

00:39:27.568 --> 00:39:30.581
All right, then. You have
to do something for me.

00:39:30.669 --> 00:39:31.892
- Huh?
- You...

00:39:31.979 --> 00:39:34.251
Just a minute now.

00:39:34.337 --> 00:39:38.137
I'm not interested
in prostituting myself.

00:39:38.355 --> 00:39:40.496
I'm sure I'll survive
without that.

00:39:40.714 --> 00:39:43.859
Listen, I want you to teach me
the fatal nerve block.

00:39:44.077 --> 00:39:46.872
Shh.

00:39:46.959 --> 00:39:49.056
Shh. Shh.

00:39:49.448 --> 00:39:51.458
But that's
a secret move.

00:39:51.808 --> 00:39:53.598
It won't be
imparted now.

00:39:53.685 --> 00:39:54.995
Maybe you should
hear me out.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.572
Fong Sai Yuk is the one
who needs to learn it.

00:39:57.659 --> 00:39:59.494
I want you
to show it to him.

00:40:00.847 --> 00:40:02.944
What for?
I mean, why?

00:40:03.032 --> 00:40:04.211
Why do you think?

00:40:04.298 --> 00:40:05.913
So the rest of them
who know it

00:40:06.219 --> 00:40:09.321
won't be able to take advantage
of him so much anymore.

00:40:10.019 --> 00:40:11.067
[Snoring]

00:40:11.154 --> 00:40:12.202
Ooh!

[Rooster Crows]

00:40:16.308 --> 00:40:19.016
[Grunting]

00:40:27.226 --> 00:40:28.494
Hey!

00:40:29.192 --> 00:40:30.415
Keep quiet about it.

00:40:30.633 --> 00:40:31.900
Oh, shut up.

00:40:33.035 --> 00:40:35.306
Ever try good manners?

00:40:36.005 --> 00:40:37.097
Old bat.

00:40:44.434 --> 00:40:45.613
Good morning.

00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:47.797
Lei Ling. Did you
sleep all right?

00:40:49.063 --> 00:40:50.111
What are you
wearing?

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.431
I was
practising.

00:40:56.968 --> 00:40:58.410
Hey, I have a question.

00:40:58.802 --> 00:41:03.214
If a married woman
were to, um, to...

00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:05.005
s-sleep with someone,

00:41:05.091 --> 00:41:07.494
a person to whom
she wasn't married,

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.594
but the two of them
were doing it,

00:41:11.031 --> 00:41:13.696
doing it,
well, you know.

00:41:13.913 --> 00:41:15.267
You know what
they were doing.

00:41:15.748 --> 00:41:17.277
Do you think
there's anything wrong?

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.683
Mum, what?
Something so low?

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.705
There's not even a good word
for what she's doing.

00:41:26.405 --> 00:41:29.243
I mean, I just think
sleeping around like that

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:30.684
can't be forgiven.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.650
I mean,
what kind of woman

00:41:32.736 --> 00:41:34.746
would carry on
like that?

00:41:35.008 --> 00:41:36.624
You know very well
that it's wrong.

00:41:36.886 --> 00:41:38.677
Now, what kind of woman
could this person be,

00:41:38.764 --> 00:41:41.079
sleeping with a man
she isn't married to?

00:41:41.341 --> 00:41:42.739
What was she thinking?

00:41:43.306 --> 00:41:45.272
The whole town should--
they should just destroy

00:41:45.358 --> 00:41:46.712
this little whore
as an example

00:41:46.974 --> 00:41:48.503
so it won't
happen again.

00:41:49.114 --> 00:41:51.167
So, now that
we've settled that,

00:41:51.691 --> 00:41:53.307
do you want to go
to the market today?

00:41:54.443 --> 00:41:55.491
Lei Ling?

00:41:55.884 --> 00:41:57.107
Lei Ling?

00:42:09.685 --> 00:42:10.908
Hey!

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.184
What are you doing?
I'm all naked!

00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:17.328
You should have kept
your clothes on last night.

00:42:17.765 --> 00:42:19.162
This is what you did!

00:42:19.686 --> 00:42:21.608
[Gasps]
She's pregnant!

00:42:23.486 --> 00:42:26.062
Wait!
It's not possible!

00:42:28.508 --> 00:42:30.430
Damn it! Get out
of there right now!

00:42:30.779 --> 00:42:33.749
Let me show you what I do to
guys who take advantage of me

00:42:33.836 --> 00:42:36.238
while I'm sleeping,
you lousy little pig!

00:42:36.326 --> 00:42:38.597
- I oughta cut you a new--
- Hey, put that thing away!

00:42:38.815 --> 00:42:42.309
Not until I'm finished!
I'll make you pay for this!

00:42:42.571 --> 00:42:44.012
Aah!

00:42:46.808 --> 00:42:47.943
Listen, think about it!

00:42:48.248 --> 00:42:49.341
Even if something happened,

00:42:49.428 --> 00:42:51.830
it's not possible for you
to get that big so soon!

00:42:51.918 --> 00:42:52.922
Sure,
that's what you say.

00:42:53.009 --> 00:42:54.799
It's got to be
something else.

00:42:54.887 --> 00:42:56.634
There's no way
something like that

00:42:56.722 --> 00:42:57.988
can happen overnight!

00:42:58.076 --> 00:43:00.390
I've heard the same story
a lot of times before!

00:43:00.609 --> 00:43:02.574
You set me up to have
your way with me!

00:43:02.792 --> 00:43:04.932
No, listen, it's got
to be something else!

00:43:05.019 --> 00:43:06.198
Like what?

00:43:06.286 --> 00:43:08.906
I can tell you what it is
by taking your pulse!

00:43:08.994 --> 00:43:10.348
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:43:10.741 --> 00:43:13.056
Gas!
When you're drunk,

00:43:13.535 --> 00:43:14.758
you get gas!

00:43:16.068 --> 00:43:17.248
Ohh!

00:43:22.838 --> 00:43:25.240
[Mandarin] The samurai
have brought me the box...

00:43:28.429 --> 00:43:31.136
so I want all of you
to guard it well.

00:43:31.223 --> 00:43:32.185
Yes, sir!

00:43:32.272 --> 00:43:35.504
[Humming]

00:43:37.774 --> 00:43:38.997
[laughs]

Sho Soo Li.

00:43:43.584 --> 00:43:45.068
Sho Soo Li!

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:46.465
Yes, Father.

00:43:47.165 --> 00:43:48.824
What are you
daydreaming about?

00:43:49.698 --> 00:43:50.702
A boy.

00:43:51.008 --> 00:43:52.275
[Mandarin]
Well, that's enough.

00:43:54.021 --> 00:43:56.074
We failed in our attempt
this time.

00:43:56.729 --> 00:43:58.127
Now the leader's ready.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.354
Fong is a problem.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.407
But we can still do it.

00:44:02.843 --> 00:44:05.070
Sir, but now
we're under suspicion.

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:06.686
So what?

00:44:07.167 --> 00:44:09.219
If we're under suspicion,

00:44:09.569 --> 00:44:12.102
I have information
that there's a secret

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.023
about Mr. Chan

00:44:14.111 --> 00:44:16.819
in the container
that the samurai brought

00:44:16.906 --> 00:44:18.042
to the mandarin.

00:44:18.129 --> 00:44:19.177
We'll get it.

00:44:19.483 --> 00:44:21.405
[Chan] I'm concerned
that someone may

00:44:21.491 --> 00:44:23.370
try to steal
the sacred box.

00:44:24.243 --> 00:44:25.379
If that should happen,

00:44:25.597 --> 00:44:28.480
then I'm afraid
my chances of ruling

00:44:28.567 --> 00:44:29.615
will be gone.

00:44:29.703 --> 00:44:31.711
Master, the mandarin's daughter

00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:33.633
seems to be fond
of Sai Yuk.

00:44:33.721 --> 00:44:35.162
Why not send him
after it?

00:44:35.642 --> 00:44:36.996
I don't think so.

00:44:38.306 --> 00:44:39.835
It's too dangerous
for him.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.635
But, sir,
please think about it.

00:44:44.028 --> 00:44:46.299
The mandarin's daughter
would know

00:44:46.386 --> 00:44:49.050
exactly where her father's
secrets are kept.

00:44:49.137 --> 00:44:50.928
Don't you agree
with that?

00:44:51.278 --> 00:44:53.680
You see, sir,
I've composed a letter.

00:44:53.898 --> 00:44:55.339
[Sai Yuk]
Are you here, Godfather?

00:44:57.915 --> 00:44:58.964
Sai Yuk, what is it?

00:44:59.052 --> 00:45:00.362
My mother made some soup.

00:45:00.579 --> 00:45:02.327
[Chan] I have another
assignment for you.

00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:05.602
- Yes?
- Listen, the box was located.

00:45:05.689 --> 00:45:06.607
Good, then.

00:45:06.695 --> 00:45:09.270
That shows that
anything can be done.

00:45:09.358 --> 00:45:10.407
Precisely.

00:45:10.494 --> 00:45:11.891
Except
it isn't finished.

00:45:11.978 --> 00:45:13.900
Right.
What's the mission?

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.517
Here.

00:45:15.603 --> 00:45:16.608
Take a look.

00:45:20.713 --> 00:45:22.766
This is a love letter
from me.

00:45:22.854 --> 00:45:24.295
Uh, yes.

00:45:24.381 --> 00:45:26.435
This is just how you begin
your assignment--

00:45:26.741 --> 00:45:27.964
Talking to a woman

00:45:28.181 --> 00:45:31.151
and thereby establishing
some kind of way

00:45:31.239 --> 00:45:33.291
to win her trust,
so she'll help us.

00:45:33.378 --> 00:45:34.426
Understand?

00:45:35.257 --> 00:45:37.528
But, wait. No, no, no.
No, no, no.

00:45:37.615 --> 00:45:39.667
But what--what if my wife
finds out about it?

00:45:39.755 --> 00:45:41.546
Hey, now, don't you
worry about it.

00:45:41.633 --> 00:45:43.075
I mean, who's going
to tell her?

00:45:43.511 --> 00:45:44.777
I suppose.

00:45:45.083 --> 00:45:47.966
But should I pretend
that I'm in love?

00:45:48.708 --> 00:45:49.800
It's up to you.

00:45:49.887 --> 00:45:51.591
I just want you
to get close to her.

00:45:52.028 --> 00:45:53.512
And have sex with her?

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:54.910
No sex.

00:45:55.478 --> 00:45:57.050
You get my box.

00:45:57.312 --> 00:45:58.797
You're going
to the Mandarin Palace.

00:45:59.103 --> 00:46:00.151
That's where
you'll meet her.

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:03.077
Is this girl someone
that I've seen yet?

00:46:03.296 --> 00:46:04.475
Yes.

00:46:04.562 --> 00:46:07.183
You will recognise her
when you see her face.

00:46:07.575 --> 00:46:09.758
I hope she won't want
to get married.

00:46:10.327 --> 00:46:12.379
- That would be a disaster.
- [Yun] Mr. Chan,

00:46:13.122 --> 00:46:15.262
what about me, sir?

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:18.755
I'll volunteer to go.

00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:20.721
Yeah.

00:46:21.288 --> 00:46:22.642
He could take my place.

00:46:23.036 --> 00:46:24.696
But you're not
a ladies' man. Ow!

00:46:25.787 --> 00:46:27.010
Listen!

00:46:27.229 --> 00:46:29.150
He failed on
the previous mission.

00:46:30.198 --> 00:46:31.814
Now it's my turn to try.

00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:34.435
But your father worked
against the mandarin.

00:46:34.653 --> 00:46:36.400
They wouldn't let you in
without a fight.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.714
Sai Yuk isn't known
to them at all.

00:46:39.632 --> 00:46:40.767
Yes...

00:46:41.161 --> 00:46:42.470
and she really likes him.

00:46:42.557 --> 00:46:43.780
We'll see.

00:46:44.086 --> 00:46:45.659
We'll see.

00:46:45.746 --> 00:46:47.100
I just might succeed.

00:46:47.406 --> 00:46:48.541
You betting on it?

00:46:48.803 --> 00:46:50.681
Certainly. Why don't
we set a wager?

00:46:50.769 --> 00:46:52.472
What is your bet?

00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:54.524
If I lose,
I'll find a way

00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:55.878
to destroy my kung fu.

00:46:56.358 --> 00:46:57.537
All right, then.

00:46:59.241 --> 00:47:00.508
Don't be worried.

00:47:01.294 --> 00:47:04.220
[Soo Li] "A chance meeting
along the riverbank

00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:07.757
and now I have
only fate to thank.

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:11.426
I long for a word, a glance, a look.

00:47:11.513 --> 00:47:14.002
I remain your servant,
Fong Sai Yuk."

00:47:16.056 --> 00:47:17.846
Oh, how wonderful!

00:47:19.855 --> 00:47:22.126
[laughs]

00:47:40.425 --> 00:47:41.605
[gasps]

00:47:41.691 --> 00:47:42.828
Dad.

00:47:49.378 --> 00:47:51.694
A young man
wants to court me.

00:47:52.523 --> 00:47:54.925
I know that
you'll like him.

00:47:57.458 --> 00:47:59.379
So, who is
this young man?

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.214
Is he a scoundrel?

00:48:01.302 --> 00:48:02.830
No. He's not.

00:48:04.708 --> 00:48:07.241
Well, then, if he wants
to court you,

00:48:07.678 --> 00:48:08.901
he'll have to
prove himself.

00:48:08.988 --> 00:48:10.167
Well, that's perfect.

00:48:16.238 --> 00:48:18.552
Mum, shouldn't I tell
Ting Ting?

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.037
No. There she is.

00:48:20.343 --> 00:48:21.391
Hold this.

00:48:21.785 --> 00:48:23.181
Wait.
I don't want it.

00:48:23.269 --> 00:48:24.230
You hold it.

00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:25.584
All right.
Listen.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.680
Yeah?
What should I do?

00:48:27.768 --> 00:48:29.078
You should just
kiss her, that's what.

00:48:29.165 --> 00:48:30.301
Don't play shy.

00:48:30.388 --> 00:48:31.742
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

00:48:32.222 --> 00:48:33.882
Just go right over there
and give her one.

00:48:33.969 --> 00:48:35.236
- Right here?
- There she is.

00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:36.502
Okay, then.

00:48:46.897 --> 00:48:49.212
Let's get to it, hmm?

00:48:51.308 --> 00:48:54.496
You've come to me
at long last.

00:48:55.369 --> 00:48:57.509
- But we, uh--
- Are you scared?

00:48:57.597 --> 00:48:58.645
Ma?

00:48:58.732 --> 00:49:00.261
I'll fix that.

00:49:01.003 --> 00:49:02.706
Come on.
Don't be afraid.

00:49:03.187 --> 00:49:04.497
You should've
kissed him.

00:49:05.545 --> 00:49:06.550
Hmmph!

00:49:08.297 --> 00:49:10.131
She wants you
all the more.

00:49:10.655 --> 00:49:11.747
What's the matter?

00:49:11.834 --> 00:49:12.926
Nothing.

00:49:14.062 --> 00:49:15.984
You don't want to let
her get away now.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.686
Better go.

00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:21.180
All right. Unh!

00:49:22.273 --> 00:49:23.321
Ooh!

00:49:30.002 --> 00:49:31.139
That was easy.

00:49:31.837 --> 00:49:32.885
Oh!

00:49:33.147 --> 00:49:35.374
Mmm.

00:49:35.637 --> 00:49:38.082
What are you doing?
Go after her.

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:40.134
What?
You mean...

00:49:40.965 --> 00:49:42.755
You kissed
one of the Buddhist nuns?

00:49:43.673 --> 00:49:46.119
Hey, it could be the first
kiss that she ever got.

00:49:46.206 --> 00:49:47.559
- Now come on.
- Okay.

00:49:47.777 --> 00:49:48.957
She might ask you
for more.

00:49:49.044 --> 00:49:50.573
Ahh! Ahh!

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:54.329
I must've
scared her away.

00:49:54.416 --> 00:49:55.639
Maybe she doesn't
want me.

00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:57.735
- Oh, stop it.
- Stop what?

00:49:57.822 --> 00:49:58.870
[Soo Li] Sai Yuk,

00:49:58.958 --> 00:50:00.618
do you want to
marry me or not?

00:50:00.705 --> 00:50:03.194
Sure, I do, but there's
one condition.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.636
Well, what is it?

00:50:04.723 --> 00:50:05.771
That box you have.

00:50:05.859 --> 00:50:07.736
All right.
I can get it somehow,

00:50:07.824 --> 00:50:09.352
but you'll also have
to prove yourself

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.663
in a competition
you'll win,

00:50:10.925 --> 00:50:12.802
and you'll also
declare your love.

00:50:13.021 --> 00:50:14.331
- Deal.
- Bet on it.

00:50:45.689 --> 00:50:47.655
The competition
will soon start.

00:50:48.965 --> 00:50:51.629
The winner
will marry Sho Soo Li.

00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:55.035
The rules are simple,
so now listen.

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:57.962
Whichever man
retrieves the flowered ball

00:50:58.048 --> 00:50:59.795
from the top
of the bridal sedan,

00:51:00.101 --> 00:51:01.805
I shall proclaim
the winner,

00:51:01.891 --> 00:51:04.032
and then he will also wed
my daughter.

00:51:05.211 --> 00:51:07.832
The true competition
will now begin.

00:51:08.224 --> 00:51:09.797
[Playing fanfare]

00:51:12.199 --> 00:51:13.990
[Crowd] Ohh.

00:51:14.383 --> 00:51:16.959
Ooh, what
arresting beauty.

00:51:19.056 --> 00:51:20.497
[Soo Li] Where is he?

00:51:23.816 --> 00:51:25.607
She'll make
a fine bride.

00:51:26.524 --> 00:51:27.528
Too bad.

00:51:27.878 --> 00:51:29.319
Too bad
she'll be mine.

00:51:29.668 --> 00:51:30.935
I'll win.

00:51:32.026 --> 00:51:33.294
She'll be
my wife

00:51:33.511 --> 00:51:34.822
once I'm
finished.

00:51:35.565 --> 00:51:38.054
Sorry, my friends,

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:39.975
I'm going to win.

00:51:40.237 --> 00:51:41.548
Contestants, get ready.

00:51:41.854 --> 00:51:43.251
[Men grunt]

00:51:43.818 --> 00:51:44.779
And start!

00:51:44.866 --> 00:51:46.395
[Yelling]

00:52:30.943 --> 00:52:32.428
Kick them!

[Men Yelling]

00:53:14.223 --> 00:53:15.446
Mmm!

00:54:24.843 --> 00:54:27.332
I told you we'd be late
carrying this flagpole.

00:54:27.682 --> 00:54:29.909
Don't worry. These guys
can't keep us out.

00:54:30.826 --> 00:54:31.831
[Both] What do you want?

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:34.059
- The girl.
- The kung fu contest.

00:54:34.146 --> 00:54:35.718
- He's too late.
- Am I?

00:54:38.906 --> 00:54:40.129
Hmm.

00:54:41.046 --> 00:54:42.007
Ohh! Aah!

00:54:42.095 --> 00:54:43.754
[Laughter]

00:54:48.907 --> 00:54:50.480
Aha! Oh!

00:55:03.756 --> 00:55:04.674
Ooh.

00:55:13.365 --> 00:55:14.588
[Man] Hey!

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.436
Hello.

00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:22.754
- Huh?
- Hey, there.

00:55:26.379 --> 00:55:28.126
Aah!

00:55:28.781 --> 00:55:30.485
[Crowd] Ohh!

00:55:35.114 --> 00:55:36.163
Yeah.

About time
you made it.

00:55:43.238 --> 00:55:44.286
I'm sorry.

00:55:45.596 --> 00:55:46.556
Have you been waiting?

00:55:47.823 --> 00:55:49.221
So long.

00:55:49.527 --> 00:55:50.662
Bored yet?

00:55:52.453 --> 00:55:54.156
Hey, don't get thrown off.

00:55:56.907 --> 00:55:59.266
Well, men,
have a nice ride down.

00:56:13.941 --> 00:56:15.032
Are you ready?

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.303
I was hoping you were
going to ask me that.

00:56:22.763 --> 00:56:23.811
All right.

00:56:27.698 --> 00:56:29.313
[All] Aah!

00:56:35.341 --> 00:56:36.389
Good, huh?

00:56:36.476 --> 00:56:37.655
Wow.

00:56:37.917 --> 00:56:39.620
Just amazing. Huh?

00:56:45.123 --> 00:56:47.350
I know.
You want me to jump.

00:56:48.267 --> 00:56:51.019
Hai!

00:56:51.631 --> 00:56:52.591
- Whoo.
- Let's go.

00:56:54.819 --> 00:56:56.216
Thanks.

00:57:07.222 --> 00:57:08.357
What? Huh?

00:57:08.838 --> 00:57:10.715
- Hmm?
- What's the matter?

00:57:11.284 --> 00:57:12.594
Can't you look me in the eye?

00:57:12.681 --> 00:57:14.297
Ahh. Ready?

00:57:14.515 --> 00:57:16.000
Hey, wait.

00:57:16.262 --> 00:57:17.398
I'm shocked.

00:57:17.485 --> 00:57:18.446
Wait a minute.

00:57:18.533 --> 00:57:20.018
Come on.
Let me explain.

00:57:20.106 --> 00:57:21.460
Have you gone crazy?

00:57:21.766 --> 00:57:23.993
Didn't you think
I'd find out about this?

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.613
- Well, yes, but there's more to this...
- I don't want to hear it.

00:57:26.701 --> 00:57:27.880
...than there seems
to be right now.

00:57:27.967 --> 00:57:29.277
- I'm not going to listen.
- If you'd listen--

00:57:29.365 --> 00:57:30.413
I'm not!

00:57:31.723 --> 00:57:32.815
That might've hurt.

00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:34.212
How about this?

00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:37.051
[Crowd] Oh!

00:57:39.453 --> 00:57:40.633
Come on, settle down.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.681
I'm not done.

00:57:42.641 --> 00:57:43.908
Be sensible.

00:57:43.995 --> 00:57:44.999
I will not.

00:57:46.878 --> 00:57:48.363
Why is she bothering us?

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:51.026
Uh--

00:57:51.114 --> 00:57:54.696
I'll tell you why.
I'm his wife.

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:56.748
Don't believe it.

00:57:57.446 --> 00:57:59.368
Oh, two can play at that.

00:57:59.456 --> 00:58:00.854
All right.

00:58:01.464 --> 00:58:02.731
Wait!

00:58:15.659 --> 00:58:16.663
Creep!

00:58:24.393 --> 00:58:25.878

a better way.

[Straining]

00:58:35.923 --> 00:58:37.146
Let me at them.

00:58:44.702 --> 00:58:46.056
[Ting Ting] Ohh!

00:58:48.064 --> 00:58:49.287
Ma.

00:58:51.209 --> 00:58:52.257
You asked for it.

00:58:52.824 --> 00:58:54.310
Will you help me
break this up?

00:58:54.834 --> 00:58:56.101
- Who should I take?
- That one.

00:58:57.629 --> 00:58:58.808
- Li, come on.
- Ting Ting.

00:58:59.026 --> 00:59:00.817
- Please, stop fighting.
- Come on now.

00:59:02.084 --> 00:59:04.573
Listen, he's doing--
he doesn't love her.

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:05.927
Well, I don't care.

00:59:06.014 --> 00:59:07.718
Someone should've mentioned
something to me.

00:59:07.805 --> 00:59:09.595
Hey, you wouldn't have
wanted him to do it.

00:59:09.683 --> 00:59:10.731
- Come on now, Li.
- Let me go.

00:59:10.818 --> 00:59:13.220
Let me go. I'll make you
into a slave.

00:59:13.439 --> 00:59:14.749
Let me see you
try it.

00:59:15.142 --> 00:59:16.889

Please, please.

Hey, take it easy.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:22.130
The minute he realises
what kind of woman you are,

00:59:22.217 --> 00:59:23.964
he'll drop her
like an old habit.

00:59:24.052 --> 00:59:25.623
- Whoa now!
- Why?

00:59:25.711 --> 00:59:27.196
Well, it was
for Mr. Chan.

00:59:27.983 --> 00:59:29.554
All right. If you don't
care about her,

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.607
- then go slap her.
- I will.

00:59:32.044 --> 00:59:33.092
Stop.

00:59:33.922 --> 00:59:35.363
You want that box?

00:59:36.455 --> 00:59:37.722
Huh?

00:59:37.809 --> 00:59:38.813
All right.
then I'll do it.

away from Sai Yuk.

not you.

Just ask him
if you don't believe me.

Unless you're afraid to.

Hmm?

Why won't you
look at me?

00:59:56.981 --> 01:00:00.039
- But--
- So, I'll jump, then.

Stop it. Why won't you
let me fall?

01:00:21.002 --> 01:00:23.230
[Strains] I won't.
You're my wife.

01:00:23.491 --> 01:00:25.238
I'm supposed to be
your only wife.

Sai Yuk, save me!

01:00:29.082 --> 01:00:30.042
What?

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:36.681
[Soo Li] So strong.

01:00:36.768 --> 01:00:38.297
Just like you are
in bed.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:39.607
Hmm. Ha ha!

01:00:39.956 --> 01:00:41.441
You took her to bed?

01:00:41.747 --> 01:00:44.105
All right. Let me loose,
and I'll fall, okay?

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:45.940
What are you doing?

01:00:46.332 --> 01:00:47.599
She's making it up.

Let me go!

an old lady, huh?

01:00:52.534 --> 01:00:54.412
Aah!

Oh, boy. Uhh!

my new son-in-law.

I love you,

The outside world

01:02:36.434 --> 01:02:38.486

to the wedded couple.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.548

in its tender embrace

01:02:45.212 --> 01:02:47.090

sweetness and laughter
as companions.

Whoops. Huh?

Lei Ling, I don't want
to hear that right now.

Shall I sing a song
instead?

01:03:09.015 --> 01:03:10.456
I keep remembering

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.648
Sai Yuk reciting
those words to me.

01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:19.758
What do you say?
Shall we?

01:03:20.501 --> 01:03:21.724
What's your hurry?

01:03:22.946 --> 01:03:24.650
I'll keep my end
of the bargain

01:03:24.737 --> 01:03:26.090
as long as you keep yours.

[Soo Li] What do you
really want?

01:03:29.803 --> 01:03:31.637
Me or what's in
your old box?

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.996
What?
You know I want the box.

01:03:35.656 --> 01:03:36.660

to be in a rush.

Where do you think
you're going?

- To church.
- To eat.

Is that so?

01:04:40.467 --> 01:04:42.170
You used deception on us.

You've fooled us
to get what you wanted.

Now...

I'll take back the box

01:04:50.949 --> 01:04:52.434
you stole from her.

01:04:53.001 --> 01:04:55.317
Is that what she said?
Now, how can that be?

01:04:55.578 --> 01:04:56.844
Why don't you
ask her again?

01:04:56.932 --> 01:04:58.723
Enough of your fooling.

01:04:59.203 --> 01:05:00.425

come from, huh?

the box.

then I die.

your own life?

- Save it for some other time.

rather see it burned?

Ah, you want me
to destroy it,

so no one
can learn the truth.

I must've been blind

not to see
such an ambitious man,

I don't think
you have the box at all.

01:11:21.216 --> 01:11:23.881
Would you listen to me?
All his nerve endings are intact.

01:11:23.968 --> 01:11:25.453
We can bring
his skill back.

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:27.112
- Do you mean it?
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:30.476 --> 01:11:31.611
[Mother] Sai Yuk.

01:11:31.961 --> 01:11:33.009
Sai Yuk.

01:11:34.842 --> 01:11:35.847
Ma...

01:11:36.153 --> 01:11:37.507
make sure he gets it.

01:11:37.769 --> 01:11:39.385
Ah, so the box
showed up...

01:11:41.612 --> 01:11:44.276
and Mr. Chan is really
the emperor.

01:11:44.364 --> 01:11:45.412
Emperor?

01:11:46.285 --> 01:11:47.464
But that means trouble.

01:11:47.552 --> 01:11:49.211
I'll destroy it
as soon as possible.

01:11:49.299 --> 01:11:50.303
- Hey.
- What?

01:11:50.391 --> 01:11:52.399
Don't you dare destroy it.

01:11:52.487 --> 01:11:53.709
This will come in handy.

01:11:53.797 --> 01:11:55.937
[Woman] Li Dong,
open up. It's me.

01:11:58.426 --> 01:11:59.519
I came to warn you all.

01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:00.785
Yun and his men
are on the way.

01:12:00.873 --> 01:12:01.833
That's it.

01:12:02.269 --> 01:12:03.492
- Faster.
- All right. Now hurry.

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.502
- Let's get out of here.
- We have to be faster.

01:12:09.432 --> 01:12:10.786
Unh.

01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:15.984
Have Fong read it.

01:12:16.551 --> 01:12:18.559
The book on nerve blocking.
Thank you.

01:12:18.647 --> 01:12:22.185
They're here. Make sure he reads it all.
Better get moving now. Go!

01:12:24.762 --> 01:12:26.640
- Come on!
- Over there!

01:12:26.727 --> 01:12:28.081
[Man] Surround the house!

01:12:31.575 --> 01:12:33.672
Company, halt! Come out!

01:12:35.549 --> 01:12:37.645
Fong Sai Yuk,
your day has come.

01:12:40.484 --> 01:12:41.838
He won't be needed!

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:44.459
[Laughing]

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:47.690
You know what?

01:12:48.302 --> 01:12:50.092
This is your day to die!

01:12:50.442 --> 01:12:52.014
I wouldn't be so sure
about it.

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:53.237
Go get him!

01:13:12.497 --> 01:13:13.545
Not too bad, eh?

01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:15.248
Wait until you see
my nerve blocking.

01:13:16.952 --> 01:13:19.397
[Clucks]

01:13:44.073 --> 01:13:46.955
Aah!

01:13:47.392 --> 01:13:49.096
Here, why don't
you take him?

01:13:49.445 --> 01:13:50.580
I'm going back.

01:13:52.284 --> 01:13:53.244
Can you help him?

01:13:54.904 --> 01:13:57.000
- Please.
- I'll try. Who are you?

01:13:57.219 --> 01:13:58.616
We're getting married.

01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:02.023
Please,
take care of him.

01:14:03.158 --> 01:14:06.826
Where is he? Talk!

01:14:06.914 --> 01:14:08.050
Go to hell.

01:14:12.373 --> 01:14:14.077
Hey, are you all right?

01:14:14.644 --> 01:14:16.566
Find him outside, men!
Go get him!

01:14:26.786 --> 01:14:29.057
Aah!

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.503
Dong! Oh, my God!

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:33.468
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:14:33.555 --> 01:14:34.865
[Groans]

01:14:35.259 --> 01:14:36.307
No.

01:14:36.787 --> 01:14:40.368
I must...
have been rusty.

01:14:40.674 --> 01:14:43.687
It's been a while
between fights.

01:14:44.212 --> 01:14:45.609
[Groans]

01:14:47.618 --> 01:14:49.147
I should have...

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:55.261
ohh, I should have
stayed out of it.

01:14:55.829 --> 01:14:57.357
[Groans]

01:14:58.013 --> 01:14:59.890
But you were so brave.

01:15:00.589 --> 01:15:01.681
You saved me.

01:15:03.602 --> 01:15:08.189
Th-that would be
the first time

01:15:08.887 --> 01:15:12.949
I've saved anyone
in a while.

01:15:13.822 --> 01:15:16.443
[Groans] Oh, God.

01:15:17.403 --> 01:15:18.670
Keep my

01:15:19.892 --> 01:15:23.431
memory alive.

01:15:24.479 --> 01:15:25.833
Please.

01:15:28.889 --> 01:15:30.069
Please.

01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:34.436
I promise.

01:15:37.711 --> 01:15:39.371
I won't forget.

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.559
[Sobbing]

01:15:53.653 --> 01:15:56.622
[Footsteps]

01:16:01.907 --> 01:16:03.567
[Yun] I believe...

01:16:06.492 --> 01:16:09.419
this is what
you've been looking for.

01:16:10.991 --> 01:16:15.009
It tells me
a great deal about you...

01:16:15.795 --> 01:16:17.411
the would-be emperor.

01:16:18.153 --> 01:16:20.512
You are powerless
without your followers.

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.132
We have laid waste to them.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.622
As I will to you!

01:16:29.946 --> 01:16:31.081
Not yet.

01:16:31.823 --> 01:16:35.143
Your fight with me is liable
to be your final fight.

01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:38.943
Well, do you suppose
I'd come without my men?

01:16:40.078 --> 01:16:41.563
Go ahead.

01:16:43.441 --> 01:16:45.013
See what happens
to your men.

01:16:45.624 --> 01:16:47.196
- No. I can't.
- [Men] Kill him!

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:49.773
Go ahead! What are you trying
to prove to us?

01:16:50.035 --> 01:16:51.957
Once again,
the leader is now Yun.

01:16:52.656 --> 01:16:54.054
You begin following me!

01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:56.324
You have given me
no option.

01:16:57.023 --> 01:16:59.164
I will not
allow men to die.

01:16:59.774 --> 01:17:01.216
You have the advantage.

01:17:01.653 --> 01:17:04.230
I will not permit
any more suffering.

01:17:04.928 --> 01:17:08.422
So, now, our society
is at your disposal.

01:17:16.764 --> 01:17:20.127
Brethren, once again
the Yun family rules.

01:17:20.607 --> 01:17:23.576
It was all worthwhile.
Ha ha ha!

01:17:23.664 --> 01:17:25.280
All hail
the master!

01:17:25.368 --> 01:17:28.949
[All] Hail Master Yun!

01:17:30.609 --> 01:17:32.792
Mr. Yun, sir,
what about the woman?

01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:35.019
- Huh?
- There!

01:17:38.513 --> 01:17:40.042
[Groans]

01:17:40.435 --> 01:17:41.483
Ha ha ha!

01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:44.845
Ah, yes,
you always reminded me

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:46.680
of a mother hen.

01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:50.961
Except that you look after
a flock of only one.

01:17:51.047 --> 01:17:53.668
Let's see now,
I have something for you,

01:17:53.755 --> 01:17:56.638
mother hen! Ha ha ha!

01:18:06.028 --> 01:18:08.997
[Man] Get her!
Ha ha! Get her!

01:18:09.259 --> 01:18:12.142
You're nothing but
a meddling old woman!

01:18:14.063 --> 01:18:15.461
Ha ha ha!

01:18:25.156 --> 01:18:29.611
[Men Laughing]

01:18:32.188 --> 01:18:35.420
We'll see how many days

01:18:35.769 --> 01:18:39.176
you survive. Ha ha ha!

"The art of nerve blocking."

Here you are,
Sai Yuk.

01:19:20.928 --> 01:19:22.588
Have you heard
from my mother?

01:19:26.911 --> 01:19:30.710
But it's been a month.
That can't be.

01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:33.637
Who's there?

01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:36.912
I've come about
your godfather.

01:19:36.999 --> 01:19:38.659
They're holding him
prisoner.

01:19:38.965 --> 01:19:40.581
- And my mother?
- It's bad.

01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:43.420
She's barely surviving.

01:19:44.336 --> 01:19:45.909
They've hung her
in the square.

01:19:47.525 --> 01:19:49.229
Ma! Unh!

01:19:49.315 --> 01:19:51.325
Sai Yuk, you must rest.

01:19:51.543 --> 01:19:53.464
You can rely on the
others to help her now.

01:19:53.552 --> 01:19:56.566
No. The others
are mostly dead.

01:19:57.570 --> 01:19:59.317
Those that have survived

01:20:00.191 --> 01:20:02.505
are being held prisoner
with Mr. Chan.

01:20:03.117 --> 01:20:06.611
Our army does not
exist anymore.

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:09.362
There is no one left
to fight them, Mr. Fong.

that I want.

But first I want
to watch you suffer.

wouldn't it now?

used to it. Now!

Show me what's left of
your kung fu skills!

01:29:05.544 --> 01:29:06.941
Ha ha ha!

01:29:07.552 --> 01:29:10.347
Come on. You can get up
and show him.

01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:56.598
- We'll beat him together.
- All right.

01:29:56.685 --> 01:29:57.689
I'll kill you both!

01:30:12.931 --> 01:30:14.504
- Do it now!
- Let's do it!

01:30:24.287 --> 01:30:25.509
He'll wear himself out.

01:30:29.965 --> 01:30:31.536
Aagh!

01:30:32.236 --> 01:30:33.502
Come on!

01:30:33.939 --> 01:30:35.075
Which one is
the fatal nerve?

01:30:35.423 --> 01:30:36.865
On the spine!

01:30:37.869 --> 01:30:39.398
Aah!

01:30:40.752 --> 01:30:43.197
It's called the stone dragon,
and it works like this.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.321
That's it! Good!

01:30:51.409 --> 01:30:52.719
I guess I remembered!

01:31:15.167 --> 01:31:17.263
Hyah!

01:31:28.312 --> 01:31:29.753
All right!

01:31:32.461 --> 01:31:35.606
Aah!

01:31:38.052 --> 01:31:39.187
Mother!

01:31:39.275 --> 01:31:41.327
Oh, well,
that wasn't so bad, was it?

01:31:42.244 --> 01:31:44.428
[Both] Well, at least
you could thank us now.

01:31:44.515 --> 01:31:45.695
Thanks.

01:31:46.131 --> 01:31:47.354
What are you doing here?

01:31:48.708 --> 01:31:49.931
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

01:31:50.018 --> 01:31:51.722
He shouldn't be sitting
up there like that.

01:31:51.809 --> 01:31:53.905
Oh, he won't be
bothering anybody.

01:31:54.124 --> 01:31:56.700
Well, thanks to us, right?
Let's go.

01:31:59.015 --> 01:32:00.063
Hmm?

01:32:01.198 --> 01:32:03.469
[Horses Neighing]

01:32:04.256 --> 01:32:08.056
[Men Shouting]

01:32:12.248 --> 01:32:13.733
The troops
are coming.

01:32:17.489 --> 01:32:19.323
- Get them!
- Open it up!

01:32:20.546 --> 01:32:24.171
[Men Cheering]

01:32:24.783 --> 01:32:26.136
Sir!

01:32:27.665 --> 01:32:28.844
It's our side.

01:32:50.725 --> 01:32:52.646
Sai Yuk, why don't you
return with us?

01:32:52.864 --> 01:32:55.397
I can't. I've got to be
going my own way.

01:32:56.272 --> 01:32:58.280
Too bad. The society
will miss you.

01:32:58.499 --> 01:32:59.809
[Mother]
Don't worry, Mr. Chan.

01:32:59.896 --> 01:33:02.342
If you need his assistance
for anything,

01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:03.390
you'll have it.

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:04.788
Thank you so much.

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.369
It looks like you'll have
your hands full as it is.

01:33:08.456 --> 01:33:09.679
You said it.

01:33:10.159 --> 01:33:11.906
I want to give you
something nice.

01:33:11.994 --> 01:33:13.828
But I really want for you
to have my gift now.

01:33:14.264 --> 01:33:16.798
- Now!
- But listen, Sai Yuk's grandfather

01:33:16.885 --> 01:33:18.807
gave it to him when
he was just a boy.

01:33:18.895 --> 01:33:21.340
He told me the same thing
about this very one.

01:33:22.912 --> 01:33:24.615
How could the both
of us have--

01:33:25.314 --> 01:33:27.890
I have so many
of these things.

01:33:29.244 --> 01:33:31.341
I'd like you to take one.

01:33:31.909 --> 01:33:33.044
Aah!

01:33:34.573 --> 01:33:36.364
- You're very kind.
- Okay. How about you?

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:39.464
Would you like one?
I've got about a million of 'em.

01:33:39.552 --> 01:33:41.343
We should try to
talk more often.

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:43.220
[Both] Sai Yuk!

01:33:43.482 --> 01:33:45.666
Oh, my.
Well, see you later!

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.326
[Both]
Sai Yuk, slow down!

01:33:49.859 --> 01:33:51.562
I guess I'll see you later.

01:33:52.479 --> 01:33:54.052
Ha ha! Best of luck!

01:33:54.706 --> 01:33:57.239
- [Sai Yuk] They're catching up.
- [Soo Li] What a cheap trinket!

01:33:57.458 --> 01:33:58.812
How many other girls
did you give them to?!

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.166
[Ting Ting] I can't believe you gave us
the same present!

01:34:00.253 --> 01:34:01.737
[Mother] Ladies, wait!

01:34:01.825 --> 01:34:06.542
