00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:49.900
[Mother] The seed falls
and with time,

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.987
is carried far from
the tree that bore it.

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.657
Yet the seed longs
to return...

00:01:58.242 --> 00:01:59.910
for the tree...

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:01.746
is filled with memories.

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.748
- Ma!
- Fong, save yourself!

00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.541
No way! You need
my protection!

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.883
[Mother]
Memories that are joyful

00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:16.927
and memories
that are filled with pain.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.055
Ooh, ow. It hurts.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.474
It would have been worse
if I hadn't shielded you.

00:02:21.557 --> 00:02:22.892
Please, Dad, no!

00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:28.189
I'm coming home! Yeah!

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:33.402
- Aah! Look out!
- Hey, you look great!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.321
Aah!

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.659
[Mother]
He longs to return...

00:02:40.117 --> 00:02:42.203
no matter
how great the distance...

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:44.038
or how barren
the terrain...

00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:48.042
because the memory is so strong
and lasting and clear.

00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:54.256
Its images are glimpsed
through time's pallid veil...

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.884
like an apparition.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:58.511
Come on, come on!

00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:01.055
Coming unbidden,
a shadow--

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.391
Wait a minute. Unh!

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:07.311
A shadow,
a whispering wind,

00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:08.688
calling his name.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.189
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.485
Ha ha! Hyah!

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.031
[Horse Neighs]

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.742
[Parade Music]

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.634
[Chan] Our people have
been looking forward

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.094
to this celebration.

00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:43.139
Ha ha ha! Yes, good.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.517
[Cheering]

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:49.729
It pleases me to see them
enjoying themselves.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.897
Ahh. Sai Yuk.

00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:54.525
Do you know how lucky
we both are?

00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.068
This is the way
it should be.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.446
[Waiter] Go away!
We don't allow begging here!

00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:01.031
- No! Go away!
- Sir, it's for the poor.

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:03.743
- Don't you understand--
- I told you there's no begging here.

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:04.702
Now go away.

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:05.578
Hey! Can't you--

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.079
Hey, he's with me.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.915
- Bless you, my son.
- Sorry. I didn't know.

00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:14.712
Aie!

00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:16.505
Only a minute ago
you threw him out.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.090
- Shall we?
- Fine.

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:21.594
Ow. My knees.

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:29.059
What hit me?

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.861
Reverend, there's plenty
to eat, so go on.

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:40.821
Ah, bless you.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.532
Allow me the great honour

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.743
of reading
your fortune tonight.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:50.039
I foresee that you will lead
an extraordinary life.

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:51.665
- Me?
- That's nothing.

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.293
He already has
an extraordinary wife.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.254
Yes, I'm sure.

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:59.173
You will bring him
happiness.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.510
I foresee that you
will have one boy child

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:03.719
and one girl.

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.930
- Isn't that wonderful?
- No more?

00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:11.101
I predict a minimum
of two girls and two boys

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:12.269
for you, sir.

00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:13.604
That's great!

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:19.318
Wait, sir, do you mean
that I'll--

00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:20.653
Yes, you comprehend.

00:05:20.736 --> 00:05:22.822
- But, uh...
- Mmm!

00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:25.616
Wait! Ting Ting!

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.535
Reverend, help yourself.
I've got to go.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.744
Ting Ting! Wait!

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.663
Wait! I'm not finished!

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:32.122
Don't go away!

00:05:32.748 --> 00:05:36.210
I'm afraid my godson
is always in such a big hurry.

00:05:36.293 --> 00:05:39.171
Sir, you beware.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:42.341
Your face is clouded
with evil.

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:45.094
You're mistaken.

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:47.680
No. It seems clear to me.

00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:49.223
Your palm.

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:52.351
[Chuckles]
All right. Go on.

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:56.272
Emperor!

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.235
Good sir, why are you
calling me emperor?

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.070
Because I saw it.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.490
The markings on
your hand are those

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.451
that only one of
the royal line would have.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.583
[Woman] My son, it is no longer
safe for you here.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.418
You will go to Japan

00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:19.295
to live under
the protection of Mr. Yun,

00:06:19.503 --> 00:06:21.630
leader of
the Red Flower Society.

00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:24.300
Your new name
will be Chan Ka Lok.

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:26.510
Inside of this sacred box

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.430
are documents which prove
your true birthright.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.348
One day, when it is safe,

00:06:31.432 --> 00:06:34.018
I hope that you will be able
to return to the throne.

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:37.062
[Shouting]

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:53.537
Ahem.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.083
Yes.
You should be cautious

00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:59.251
about what
you tell people.

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:00.836
I'm telling you
what I saw.

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:02.254
Nothing more.

00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:06.508
I'm...I'm sensing a man

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.802
who is close to you
will betray you...

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:12.848
yet another person close
will be there to protect you.

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:14.600
Perhaps save your life.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.897
Sai Yuk, when do
we get to be alone?

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.523
I thought
we were married.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.067
Doesn't seem
that way now.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.070
Don't be silly.
I love you.

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:30.074
Oh. Then maybe you can
show your feelings.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.451
[Whispering]

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.955
Wait, you mean make
an ass of myself?

00:07:36.246 --> 00:07:37.373
They'd laugh
at me.

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:38.999
They might laugh...

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:40.834
but I need to
hear it from you

00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:41.752
once in awhile.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.212
Hmm. All right then.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:48.175
If it's a problem,
well, I'm sorry.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:49.969
Lay down here with me.

00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:53.055
All right, then.

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:56.266
Good. But don't
make it sound wrong.

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:58.686
Hmm. All right.

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.523
I love you. Good?

00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:04.024
Let's try it again.

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:05.567
Can you say it?

00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:08.445
- All right. I love you.
- Oh.

00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:12.533
What?
Beat it right now.

00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:14.618
What he said
was pretty nice.

00:08:15.202 --> 00:08:17.079
I'd like to have
such a good boy.

00:08:17.287 --> 00:08:18.288
You're crazy!

00:08:18.706 --> 00:08:20.124
Hey, how about it?

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.376
Sai Yuk, did you
hear what he said?

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:23.585
Knock him out!

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.712
But why?

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.131
Because of what he said.
Let's beat him up right now.

00:08:28.632 --> 00:08:30.092
- Mmm!
- Don't try it.

00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:31.885
I'll do it!

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:32.845
Think so?

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.888
Hey, stop it now!
Come on!

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:37.683
[Both] Hey!
Your dad's calling you!

00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:40.019
See that?
Your father wants you.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:41.103
Go on.

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:43.564
There.

00:08:43.647 --> 00:08:44.982
I'll come back again.
You'll see.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.191
See you then.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:49.153
- Let's go.
- [Shouting]

00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:53.574
Go!

00:08:56.076 --> 00:08:57.286
They're good.

00:09:01.331 --> 00:09:05.586
[Clapping]

00:09:22.102 --> 00:09:24.271
[Chan]
Watch out! Reverend!

00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:31.111
Aah!

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:34.323
Someone, please!

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:38.994
What happened?
I'll go see!

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.334
[Yelling]

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:33.340
All right.
Shall we do it?

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:34.842
[Yelling]

00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:40.616
I'm just waiting.

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:44.036
Aah!

00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:07.351
Hold it!

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.937
It could be a trap!

00:12:10.354 --> 00:12:11.521
Save your strength.

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:14.024
[Man] The meeting of
the Red Flower Society

00:12:14.107 --> 00:12:15.442
will come to order.

00:12:15.525 --> 00:12:16.693
Congratulations.

00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:18.528
You men and women
have done well.

00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:21.365
Now let's hear from
some of our members.

00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:22.741
Who has a report?

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.494
[Man] Mr. Chan, sir!

00:12:25.577 --> 00:12:26.912
Our new fishing rights
agreement

00:12:26.995 --> 00:12:29.206
will take effect
at the start of the month.

00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:31.041
[Clapping]

00:12:31.124 --> 00:12:32.751
[Man 2] The brood mares
have given birth

00:12:32.834 --> 00:12:34.378
to three more colts!

00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:37.589
Ahh, it seems like
it's all good news, right?

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:40.300
The society is doing
tremendously right now.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.637
The value of our property
in Shanghai

00:12:44.137 --> 00:12:46.139
has increased three times!

00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:48.308
[Clapping]

00:12:48.892 --> 00:12:50.811
[Man] Sir,
all the good news

00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:52.104
calls for
a celebration!

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.273
[Chan] I'm afraid not.

00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:56.817
Some of our neighbours
have been victims

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.193
of the recent flooding.

00:12:58.568 --> 00:12:59.820
We will loan them
some money.

00:13:00.612 --> 00:13:02.531
Wow. I could do
all that, right?

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:05.742
No, you couldn't.
It'd be too much for you.

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:08.495
What? Come on.
I'm up to it.

00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:12.249
Mr. Chan, will you honour us
by naming our baby?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.001
Yes, of course.

00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:15.210
Thank you, sir.

00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:19.131
He's a handsome boy.

00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:21.800
Why don't we name him
Sung Taian?

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:25.304
I hope that he will give you
a lot of pleasure.

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:39.026
Unh!

00:13:39.943 --> 00:13:41.069
Don't kill her!

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:46.992
She tried
to kill you, sir.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.493
I had to do it.

00:13:49.244 --> 00:13:50.495
Why would Mrs. Leong--

00:13:52.372 --> 00:13:54.499
Look...
it's someone in a mask.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.959
Who could this be?

00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:58.587
Say, that woman
was with you.

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:00.255
What happened
to Mrs. Leong?

00:14:00.964 --> 00:14:02.966
Hey, what are you
babbling about?

00:14:03.383 --> 00:14:05.802
Why don't we ask him some
questions about the woman?

00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:09.181
Sure. Who's behind it?

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:12.059
He's jealous because his father
didn't appoint him to lead us!

00:14:12.142 --> 00:14:13.602
Aren't you, Mr. Yun?

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.229
And so you've become obsessed
with murdering our leader!

00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:18.565
- That's a complete lie!
- Prove it! You're a traitor, too!

00:14:18.648 --> 00:14:21.109
- [Crying]
- Stop that!

00:14:21.693 --> 00:14:24.654
How can we expect to overthrow
the Manchus when we fight each other?

00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:26.031
We must stand united!

00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:27.574
He can forget it.

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.285
Well, what happens if
we don't come together?

00:14:30.535 --> 00:14:32.412
What? What difference
would it make?

00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:35.207
The only good philosophy
would be to stay neutral.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.667
Oh, stay out of trouble,
is that what you're saying?

00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:41.421
Exactly.
You said it. You said it.

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:43.799
For those of you
who question my loyalty

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:45.675
to the Red Flower Society,

00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:47.844
I will prove myself.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.306
Hey...

00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:56.978
So I see
you were fighting.

00:14:57.729 --> 00:14:59.898
Your father
was a loyal subject,

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:04.486
and his son could not be
any less honourable.

00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:09.282
I promise that I will
search out this traitor scum

00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:10.909
and I will kill him!

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.620
Father, what happened
with her now?

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.997
- My son, go away.
- Hold on!

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.420
Son, you've seen
this woman?

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.339
Yes, sir. Dad was
talking with her

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:26.174
before the meeting
started.

00:15:28.635 --> 00:15:30.429
Well,
there you have it.

00:15:30.762 --> 00:15:31.888
You shut your face!

00:15:37.727 --> 00:15:39.855
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.482
- He's your own son!
- Who are you?

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:44.067
Who am I?

00:15:44.609 --> 00:15:47.028
Aw, are you saying
that you don't know me?

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.698
Well, I am our leader's
favourite relative...

00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:51.825
known as Fong Sai Yuk!

00:15:52.742 --> 00:15:53.743
Do you know who I am?

00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:55.912
Oh, yeah.
The boy beater.

00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:57.164
Unh!

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:58.248
Down!

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.500
What are you doing?

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.502
Do you know who
Mr. Yun's father is?

00:16:02.752 --> 00:16:03.879
He's our former leader!

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:05.630
Sir. But the little boy was--

00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.507
That will be enough!
Mr. Dong!

00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:09.259
Uh, why are you looking
at me like that?

00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:11.470
Give Fong Sai Yuk
some of your knowledge.

00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:12.679
Teach him
our commandments.

00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:14.598
- With pleasure!
- Good.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.224
See that he learns well.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:24.691
[Dong] The commandments of
the Red Flower Society.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.695
One. You will not steal
another person's property.

00:16:28.778 --> 00:16:31.406
Two. You will not covet
the property of another.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.951
Three. You will not covet
the wife of another man.

00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:36.912
Four. You will
always be truthful.

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.915
Five. Honour our leader
in every way.

00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.667
Hey, are you getting it?
I'll start again.

00:16:43.376 --> 00:16:46.087
It's more like
the seven Taoist commands.

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.089
Yeah, that's just
where he got it from,

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.217
and Mr. Yun has
adapted it for us.

00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:51.885
Huh. I thought so.

00:16:52.802 --> 00:16:54.846
[Yun] I see
you're a slow learner.

00:16:57.474 --> 00:16:59.643
Today you insulted me...

00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:01.728
and I'm not
about to forget it.

00:17:02.437 --> 00:17:05.232
It's time you learned
a more important lesson

00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:07.692
from one
who is your superior.

00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:10.779
Who? The one who
hits boys?

00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:12.697
I'd like to
see you handle

00:17:12.989 --> 00:17:15.367
someone
that hits back.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.078
How should
we settle this?

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:21.706
Maybe your godfather
could come to your rescue.

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:23.959
No! The book
of commandments

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:27.212
says to settle this
a different way.

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:29.506
Fighting.

00:17:31.174 --> 00:17:32.801
Are you ready to fight?

00:17:33.009 --> 00:17:34.010
Uh-oh.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.716
[Yun growls]

00:18:51.379 --> 00:18:53.089
[Yun growls]

00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:04.476
Enough!

00:19:04.684 --> 00:19:06.394
Fighting is not
for settling disputes

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:07.854
within the society.

00:19:08.688 --> 00:19:09.939
We are a family!

00:19:10.273 --> 00:19:12.150
You should save it
for the Manchus!

00:19:12.233 --> 00:19:13.109
I'm sorry.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.404
When someone insults
the Yun name...

00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:20.617
I will fight.

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:23.370
Be prepared
to do it again.

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:29.876
The commandments
that you learned,

00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:31.628
did you understand them?

00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:32.879
Uncle, it wasn't me!

00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:34.422
That's enough!
Kneel!

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:38.635
- Your reason?
- The boy! His own child!

00:19:38.718 --> 00:19:40.220
No one should hurt
a baby like that.

00:19:40.428 --> 00:19:42.597
You are sure
in your convictions.

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:44.349
It's your actions

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.351
I'm concerned with
right now.

00:19:46.601 --> 00:19:49.062
But am I supposed
to just ignore it?

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.065
Perhaps... yes.

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.609
When it's necessary.

00:19:55.151 --> 00:19:56.861
You think too much
like your mother.

00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:58.780
Maybe you should
go home to her.

00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:03.410
So keep reading.

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:05.203
I know he wants you
to learn it.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.288
Anyway,
this part's the hardest.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:08.623
Here.

00:20:21.052 --> 00:20:23.555
You know what?
He didn't have to do that.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.808
Maybe we ought to go and
visit with your mother.

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:28.309
What?

00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:31.479
Well, why wouldn't we?

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.399
I'll tell you all
one thing--

00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:35.900
one of these days...

00:20:36.901 --> 00:20:38.903
I'll do it. Really.

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:42.323
I'll be... the leader!

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.536
Hey, come on!
Come on!

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:47.662
Yeah.

00:20:48.204 --> 00:20:51.082
Soup. Soup always
has to be made

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:53.001
with only
the best vegetables.

00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:54.753
Madam, someone's here
to see you.

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:02.260
What's this,
a birthday party?

00:21:02.343 --> 00:21:04.012
Tell me, where's Sai Yuk?

00:21:04.262 --> 00:21:05.180
Why?

00:21:05.388 --> 00:21:07.891
From the Yangtze
to the Kowloon Harbour,

00:21:07.974 --> 00:21:09.559
I've fought them all

00:21:09.642 --> 00:21:11.436
and they call me
the Duke of Hell!

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.854
Duke of Hell?

00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:15.565
I'll show you some hell.
Pbblt!

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:21.446
Fong Sai Yuk's mother.

00:21:22.113 --> 00:21:23.698
Now, get the hell
out of my sight.

00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:25.074
Where's she going?

00:21:25.408 --> 00:21:26.951
Hey, stop her.

00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:28.745
There's just one more thing
I've got to say.

00:21:28.995 --> 00:21:31.289
- Yeah?
- Watch this. Bite me!

00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:34.793
[Yelling]

00:21:39.214 --> 00:21:40.590
Well, how'd you
like that one?

00:21:41.174 --> 00:21:43.843
Madam Fong,
that was a real good one.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.220
Oh, my soup.

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:46.805
Oh, my.

00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:49.140
Is that for
Master Fong Sai Yuk?

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:51.559
You bet it is.
See you later.

00:21:53.978 --> 00:21:55.730
I miss my master so!

00:21:56.314 --> 00:21:58.066
Sai Yuk!

00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:26.553
My good sir, I wonder if
you might be able to help me.

00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:28.263
I'm all out of water.

00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:30.306
Ahh.

00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:37.021
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:46.489
"On the first of the month,

00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:49.742
a band of Japanese samurai
will travel nearby.

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:53.162
They will have
the sacred box

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:54.789
in which your secret
is hidden."

00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:59.043
Mr. Lin!

00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:00.378
Yes, sir!

00:23:00.753 --> 00:23:01.713
[Chan] Mr. Wong!

00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:03.131
Here, sir!

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.390
[Dong] I hope he doesn't
want me to go.

00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:17.437
- Mr. Dong.
- I don't think I'm ready yet.

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:19.814
Take someone on the mission
who is more prepared.

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:20.899
Calm down.

00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:24.068
Better to name a good fighter
to go on this mission.

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:25.778
That won't be you.

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:27.739
Who would be
your choice?

00:23:28.489 --> 00:23:31.200
Ha ha!
I say we take Sai Yuk

00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:32.744
because he's always ready.

00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:35.371
That's what I think anyway.

00:23:36.164 --> 00:23:37.081
Fong Sai Yuk!

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:38.416
Yo! Yes, sir!

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.792
[Dong] Go, Sai Yuk!

00:23:42.003 --> 00:23:44.756
The mission is yours.
Do you accept it?

00:23:45.214 --> 00:23:46.090
I do!

00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:47.967
Some of you
may not come back.

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:51.679
[All] Huh! All of us
are prepared to die!

00:23:52.138 --> 00:23:53.932
[Chan] Bring back
the sacred box!

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.523
The numbers four and nine.

00:24:02.815 --> 00:24:05.735
Four and nine?
[Laughs]

00:24:05.818 --> 00:24:08.529
[Laughing]

00:24:08.738 --> 00:24:10.323
What is so damn funny?

00:24:10.406 --> 00:24:11.532
Well,
they were laughing.

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:13.785
Because you've got
the loser's hand.

00:24:13.993 --> 00:24:15.578
- In mahjong?
- Roulette.

00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:16.746
I don't play it.

00:24:16.996 --> 00:24:18.873
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Remember now?

00:24:19.082 --> 00:24:20.833
Oh, yeah. Number six,
I shall not steal.

00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:23.252
Besides that.
You shall bring my girlfriend something.

00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:24.587
I won't forget.

00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:26.381
Bye. Good luck.

00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:29.509
Hyah!

00:24:32.053 --> 00:24:33.304
[Ting Ting] Sai Yuk!

00:24:34.305 --> 00:24:36.975
Hold on. Let's be certain
that you're safe.

00:24:37.684 --> 00:24:39.644
Take this. It's good luck.

00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:40.895
Yeah, you're right.

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:42.689
We can't just
sit here all day.

00:24:43.106 --> 00:24:44.357
We're on a mission.

00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:46.818
Why are we waiting, then?
Good-bye.

00:24:48.444 --> 00:24:50.738
Stay safe, all right?
Bye-bye!

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.241
Hyah! Hyah!

00:25:00.957 --> 00:25:03.835
Ah, hello!
It's Mama Fong!

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.545
Lei Ling!

00:25:06.879 --> 00:25:08.297
What brings you
here today?

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:09.924
Go on. Go on.

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:11.634
- My stable.
- [Man] Yes, miss.

00:25:11.718 --> 00:25:12.635
So, what's the occasion?

00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:14.012
I brought soup
for Sai Yuk.

00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:15.054
He's on a mission!

00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:17.682
Right now? But I made
some soup for him.

00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:20.977
I can't believe you brought
his favourite soup all this way.

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:22.979
Mmm. Looks good.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:36.451
What's the matter?

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.619
[Sai Yuk]
Quiet! Hear that?

00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:05.897
[Sai Yuk]
It's the samurai!

00:26:07.815 --> 00:26:09.567
[Man] That woman's
in trouble.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.362
Wait. I've seen
that woman before.

00:26:16.824 --> 00:26:18.284
Hey, there, miss!

00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:20.745
What are you doing?
Get away!

00:26:20.828 --> 00:26:22.038
Hello, Sai.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.206
You know me?

00:26:24.957 --> 00:26:26.000
[Man] The sacred box!

00:26:27.293 --> 00:26:28.961
[Yelling]

00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:38.513
[Yelling]

00:27:14.423 --> 00:27:15.967
They used nerve blocking
to paralyse you,

00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:17.218
but I can undo it.

00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:22.390
Hey! I'm still paralysed
from the waist down!

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:23.975
Oh.

00:27:28.312 --> 00:27:29.438
I'm sorry.

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:31.482
Go on.

00:27:33.609 --> 00:27:34.902
I'm not sure how.

00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:42.785
I'll carry you.
Come on.

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:43.995
Oh!

00:28:27.371 --> 00:28:28.331
[Samurai] Get them!

00:28:28.414 --> 00:28:29.415
Go!

00:28:38.132 --> 00:28:39.884
[gasps]

00:28:49.727 --> 00:28:51.854
Yaah!

00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:27.431
[Samurai] I'm going
to paralyse you!

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:30.685
Get them!

00:29:58.629 --> 00:29:59.588
Matsuhiro!

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.382
Matsuhiro?

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.718
It's your mother.

00:30:04.218 --> 00:30:06.387
Ma! The box,
right there.

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.014
We need it.

00:30:20.776 --> 00:30:22.111
Yes, sir.

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:44.842
Still here?

00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:46.135
Still here!

00:30:52.058 --> 00:30:53.517
I'll take that box now.

00:31:05.071 --> 00:31:06.197
All my nerves
are blocked.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.490
Can she do
anything?

00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:10.493
Hmm? Oh, no.

00:31:11.118 --> 00:31:11.994
No?

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:13.412
I wouldn't know how.

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:14.622
Oh, come on.

00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:22.213
Hey, he'll do.

00:31:22.588 --> 00:31:24.757
[Buzzing]

00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:28.636
Ai!

00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:32.681
Now, try to get it
into a good position.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.726
Look out. Now blow it
at me hard.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.566
I keep missing.
You do it.

00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:48.656
Your technique needs work.
It's too high.

00:31:51.158 --> 00:31:52.451
[Gulp]

00:31:54.286 --> 00:31:55.246
It's so--

00:31:56.997 --> 00:31:57.873
I missed, huh?

00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:00.584
Sorry. Is it bad?

00:32:00.793 --> 00:32:04.964
Ugh. Tastes like
you'd expect it to taste.

00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:08.342
Hey, watch. It's going
to get interesting.

00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:10.636
Ohh!

00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:24.275
That did it. Let's go.

00:32:27.528 --> 00:32:28.487
- What are you looking at?
- Me?

00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:29.738
Yeah, you.

00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:31.699
Wait. There's something
you can show me.

00:32:31.782 --> 00:32:33.701
All right, I'd be happy to.
What is it?

00:32:34.201 --> 00:32:36.412
Well, how do you
unparalyse the legs?

00:32:36.745 --> 00:32:38.247
Just hit him
in the stomach.

00:32:39.248 --> 00:32:40.374
Oh.

00:32:58.684 --> 00:33:01.061
[Yun] That Fong Sai Yuck!

00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:07.693
It's Fong Sai Yuk.

00:33:08.819 --> 00:33:11.363
Listen, son,
let me do the talking. Me.

00:33:11.447 --> 00:33:12.615
But, Mum, you can't.

00:33:13.824 --> 00:33:14.700
There he goes!

00:33:14.783 --> 00:33:16.327
Following his mother
around again!

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.245
[Laughter]

00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:22.374
I know.
Always her little dog.

00:33:22.958 --> 00:33:24.376
He follows her.

00:33:25.711 --> 00:33:28.130
If you have something to say,
then say it out loud,

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.632
or keep your mouth shut.

00:33:30.007 --> 00:33:31.717
Look at you all
sitting here,

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.512
stuffing your faces while
my son is out risking his neck

00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:36.180
for the Red Flower Society.

00:33:36.263 --> 00:33:39.475
If any of you had an ounce of bravery,
instead of sitting here,

00:33:39.558 --> 00:33:41.602
you'd be out doing
something about it.

00:33:41.685 --> 00:33:43.771
But all I see
are six or seven men

00:33:43.854 --> 00:33:46.357
who, I must say, haven't
shown me a damn thing!

00:33:46.565 --> 00:33:47.816
Shut up!

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:49.401
On this mission,

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:53.072
why was it only your son
who returned unharmed?

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.241
What of it?

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.078
Does your mother
fight your battles?

00:34:00.663 --> 00:34:01.872
So!

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:05.209
Simple...

00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:06.961
he fights better
than most of them.

00:34:07.878 --> 00:34:08.796
Understand?

00:34:13.926 --> 00:34:15.719
You want me?
Let's do it, then.

00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:17.972
Only remember
who started it.

00:34:18.305 --> 00:34:20.224
You don't have to fight
this fool for me.

00:34:20.307 --> 00:34:21.809
For once shut your mouth!

00:34:22.768 --> 00:34:23.602
I'm sick of it!

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:26.564
Mr. Yun...
I'll take care of it.

00:34:26.647 --> 00:34:28.566
- Uh-huh.
- Mr. Chan,

00:34:28.649 --> 00:34:30.401
if I might possibly have
a word with you?

00:34:30.484 --> 00:34:31.902
I'm Mrs. Fong.

00:34:31.986 --> 00:34:33.696
Yes. You're
Sai Yuk's mum.

00:34:34.822 --> 00:34:37.157
That's it?
The boy's mum?

00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:40.744
Mr. Chan, all of Han Mei
knows my reputation.

00:34:40.828 --> 00:34:42.288
Don't tell me
you don't know me.

00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:43.956
About all the fights
that I've won?

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:45.541
Please tell me
you know me.

00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:48.294
You must be joking.
Can't be.

00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:50.004
Son, let's get out
of this house.

00:34:50.087 --> 00:34:51.714
I'm being toyed with.
Good day.

00:34:51.797 --> 00:34:53.424
We have a duty
to the Red Flower.

00:34:53.632 --> 00:34:55.175
Stay here then.
I'll go.

00:34:55.884 --> 00:34:56.885
Hmm?

00:34:58.804 --> 00:35:00.598
I think I've changed
my mind.

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:02.725
If you happen to be
looking for me,

00:35:02.808 --> 00:35:03.809
I'll be here.

00:35:03.892 --> 00:35:05.853
[Thunder rumbling]

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:22.453
It's pouring.
You shouldn't be out.

00:35:22.536 --> 00:35:23.829
I have come to visit.

00:35:25.664 --> 00:35:26.874
Ohh!

00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:28.709
Aah!

00:35:28.792 --> 00:35:30.044
[Groaning]

00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:32.880
I've brought some presents.
A few trinkets...

00:35:32.963 --> 00:35:35.799
and some Japanese sakémoto.

00:35:36.091 --> 00:35:38.344
Stronger than wine.
Let me help.

00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:40.638
No, wait, no, wait. I'm not sure
I'm up to it.

00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:42.598
I haven't seen this before.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.850
Oh, well,
guess it's all mine.

00:35:45.142 --> 00:35:47.561
But it's immoral!
Listen to what I'm saying!

00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:49.688
You--you can't
drink that in here!

00:35:49.938 --> 00:35:51.106
What will people say?

00:35:51.607 --> 00:35:54.485
Please!
I'm begging--Aah!

00:35:54.985 --> 00:35:56.153
That's right.

00:35:57.112 --> 00:35:59.448
You'd better help me...

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:01.825
or I might get drunk.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.244
But it's sakémoto!

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.996
We'll both end up drunk

00:36:06.246 --> 00:36:08.082
and you don't want--
Ohh!

00:36:13.379 --> 00:36:18.634
These fingers are very, very, very, very,
very, very, very eager.

00:36:18.717 --> 00:36:20.552
[Giggling]

00:36:20.928 --> 00:36:22.429
Don't tell me
you're shy.

00:36:23.305 --> 00:36:24.932
You're afraid
it will...

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:28.936
go too far?

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.730
[Giggles]

00:36:32.981 --> 00:36:36.068
What have I done
to deserve this?!

00:36:39.071 --> 00:36:41.490
I thought
I'd seen the last of her

00:36:41.573 --> 00:36:44.284
so many years ago!

00:36:46.245 --> 00:36:49.498
Wait! Wait!
Where are you going?

00:36:49.581 --> 00:36:50.582
War zone.

00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:53.919
You mustn't try
to stop me.

00:36:54.628 --> 00:36:55.546
Take this.

00:36:55.629 --> 00:36:58.173
No.
Anything but that.

00:36:58.757 --> 00:37:01.009
You know how much
you love my soup.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.344
Here.

00:37:02.428 --> 00:37:04.054
I can't or I'll
never go to war.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.892
There isn't anyone
around to see us.

00:37:09.101 --> 00:37:11.061
Perhaps if we shared
it once more?

00:37:11.812 --> 00:37:14.148
No! Why do you tempt me

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:16.608
when you know I must go?

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:18.736
There!

00:37:18.819 --> 00:37:19.737
[Pot Breaks]

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.155
Damn fool!

00:37:22.197 --> 00:37:24.241
There's something
about sake.

00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:26.452
The more you drink...

00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:28.912
the more you want.

00:37:30.622 --> 00:37:33.500
All right, then. You have
to do something for me.

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:34.752
- Huh?
- You...

00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:37.004
Just a minute now.

00:37:37.087 --> 00:37:40.716
I'm not interested
in prostituting myself.

00:37:40.924 --> 00:37:42.968
I'm sure I'll survive
without that.

00:37:43.177 --> 00:37:46.180
Listen, I want you to teach me
the fatal nerve block.

00:37:46.388 --> 00:37:49.057
Shh.

00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:51.143
Shh. Shh.

00:37:51.518 --> 00:37:53.437
But that's
a secret move.

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:55.481
It won't be
imparted now.

00:37:55.564 --> 00:37:56.815
Maybe you should
hear me out.

00:37:57.316 --> 00:37:59.276
Fong Sai Yuk is the one
who needs to learn it.

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:01.111
I want you
to show it to him.

00:38:02.404 --> 00:38:04.406
What for?
I mean, why?

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.616
Why do you think?

00:38:05.699 --> 00:38:07.242
So the rest of them
who know it

00:38:07.534 --> 00:38:10.496
won't be able to take advantage
of him so much anymore.

00:38:11.163 --> 00:38:12.164
[Snoring]

00:38:12.247 --> 00:38:13.248
Ooh!

00:38:14.082 --> 00:38:16.543
[Rooster Crows]

00:38:17.169 --> 00:38:19.755
[Grunting]

00:38:27.596 --> 00:38:28.806
Hey!

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:30.641
Keep quiet about it.

00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:32.059
Oh, shut up.

00:38:33.143 --> 00:38:35.312
Ever try good manners?

00:38:35.979 --> 00:38:37.022
Old bat.

00:38:44.029 --> 00:38:45.155
Good morning.

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:47.241
Lei Ling. Did you
sleep all right?

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:49.451
What are you
wearing?

00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:52.621
I was
practising.

00:38:55.999 --> 00:38:57.376
Hey, I have a question.

00:38:57.751 --> 00:39:01.964
If a married woman
were to, um, to...

00:39:02.214 --> 00:39:03.674
s-sleep with someone,

00:39:03.757 --> 00:39:06.051
a person to whom
she wasn't married,

00:39:06.134 --> 00:39:09.012
but the two of them
were doing it,

00:39:09.429 --> 00:39:11.974
doing it,
well, you know.

00:39:12.182 --> 00:39:13.475
You know what
they were doing.

00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:15.394
Do you think
there's anything wrong?

00:39:15.894 --> 00:39:18.647
Mum, what?
Something so low?

00:39:20.315 --> 00:39:23.443
There's not even a good word
for what she's doing.

00:39:24.111 --> 00:39:26.822
I mean, I just think
sleeping around like that

00:39:26.905 --> 00:39:28.198
can't be forgiven.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:30.075
I mean,
what kind of woman

00:39:30.158 --> 00:39:32.077
would carry on
like that?

00:39:32.327 --> 00:39:33.871
You know very well
that it's wrong.

00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:35.831
Now, what kind of woman
could this person be,

00:39:35.914 --> 00:39:38.125
sleeping with a man
she isn't married to?

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:39.710
What was she thinking?

00:39:40.252 --> 00:39:42.129
The whole town should--
they should just destroy

00:39:42.212 --> 00:39:43.505
this little whore
as an example

00:39:43.755 --> 00:39:45.215
so it won't
happen again.

00:39:45.799 --> 00:39:47.759
So, now that
we've settled that,

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.803
do you want to go
to the market today?

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:51.889
Lei Ling?

00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:53.432
Lei Ling?

00:40:05.444 --> 00:40:06.612
Hey!

00:40:07.779 --> 00:40:09.740
What are you doing?
I'm all naked!

00:40:09.948 --> 00:40:12.743
You should have kept
your clothes on last night.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.494
This is what you did!

00:40:14.995 --> 00:40:16.830
[Gasps]
She's pregnant!

00:40:18.624 --> 00:40:21.084
Wait!
It's not possible!

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.255
Damn it! Get out
of there right now!

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:28.425
Let me show you what I do to
guys who take advantage of me

00:40:28.508 --> 00:40:30.802
while I'm sleeping,
you lousy little pig!

00:40:30.886 --> 00:40:33.055
- I oughta cut you a new--
- Hey, put that thing away!

00:40:33.263 --> 00:40:36.600
Not until I'm finished!
I'll make you pay for this!

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.226
Aah!

00:40:40.896 --> 00:40:41.980
Listen, think about it!

00:40:42.272 --> 00:40:43.315
Even if something happened,

00:40:43.398 --> 00:40:45.692
it's not possible for you
to get that big so soon!

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:46.735
Sure,
that's what you say.

00:40:46.818 --> 00:40:48.528
It's got to be
something else.

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:50.280
There's no way
something like that

00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:51.573
can happen overnight!

00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:53.867
I've heard the same story
a lot of times before!

00:40:54.076 --> 00:40:55.953
You set me up to have
your way with me!

00:40:56.161 --> 00:40:58.205
No, listen, it's got
to be something else!

00:40:58.288 --> 00:40:59.414
Like what?

00:40:59.498 --> 00:41:02.000
I can tell you what it is
by taking your pulse!

00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:03.377
Is it a boy or a girl?

00:41:03.752 --> 00:41:05.963
Gas!
When you're drunk,

00:41:06.421 --> 00:41:07.589
you get gas!

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.967
Ohh!

00:41:15.305 --> 00:41:17.599
[Mandarin] The samurai
have brought me the box...

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:23.230
so I want all of you
to guard it well.

00:41:23.313 --> 00:41:24.231
Yes, sir!

00:41:24.314 --> 00:41:27.401
[Humming]

00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:30.737
[laughs]

00:41:31.446 --> 00:41:32.781
Sho Soo Li.

00:41:35.117 --> 00:41:36.535
Sho Soo Li!

00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:37.869
Yes, Father.

00:41:38.537 --> 00:41:40.122
What are you
daydreaming about?

00:41:40.956 --> 00:41:41.915
A boy.

00:41:42.207 --> 00:41:43.417
[Mandarin]
Well, that's enough.

00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:47.045
We failed in our attempt
this time.

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.006
Now the leader's ready.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.133
Fong is a problem.

00:41:51.883 --> 00:41:53.093
But we can still do it.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.637
Sir, but now
we're under suspicion.

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:57.180
So what?

00:41:57.639 --> 00:41:59.599
If we're under suspicion,

00:41:59.933 --> 00:42:02.352
I have information
that there's a secret

00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:04.187
about Mr. Chan

00:42:04.271 --> 00:42:06.857
in the container
that the samurai brought

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.025
to the mandarin.

00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:09.109
We'll get it.

00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:11.236
[Chan] I'm concerned
that someone may

00:42:11.319 --> 00:42:13.113
try to steal
the sacred box.

00:42:13.947 --> 00:42:15.032
If that should happen,

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.993
then I'm afraid
my chances of ruling

00:42:18.076 --> 00:42:19.077
will be gone.

00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:21.079
Master, the mandarin's daughter

00:42:21.163 --> 00:42:22.914
seems to be fond
of Sai Yuk.

00:42:22.998 --> 00:42:24.374
Why not send him
after it?

00:42:24.833 --> 00:42:26.126
I don't think so.

00:42:27.377 --> 00:42:28.837
It's too dangerous
for him.

00:42:30.255 --> 00:42:32.466
But, sir,
please think about it.

00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:35.010
The mandarin's daughter
would know

00:42:35.093 --> 00:42:37.637
exactly where her father's
secrets are kept.

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.431
Don't you agree
with that?

00:42:39.765 --> 00:42:42.059
You see, sir,
I've composed a letter.

00:42:42.267 --> 00:42:43.643
[Sai Yuk]
Are you here, Godfather?

00:42:46.104 --> 00:42:47.105
Sai Yuk, what is it?

00:42:47.189 --> 00:42:48.440
My mother made some soup.

00:42:48.648 --> 00:42:50.317
[Chan] I have another
assignment for you.

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:53.445
- Yes?
- Listen, the box was located.

00:42:53.528 --> 00:42:54.404
Good, then.

00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:56.948
That shows that
anything can be done.

00:42:57.032 --> 00:42:58.033
Precisely.

00:42:58.116 --> 00:42:59.451
Except
it isn't finished.

00:42:59.534 --> 00:43:01.369
Right.
What's the mission?

00:43:01.828 --> 00:43:02.913
Here.

00:43:02.996 --> 00:43:03.955
Take a look.

00:43:07.876 --> 00:43:09.836
This is a love letter
from me.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.296
Uh, yes.

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:13.340
This is just how you begin
your assignment--

00:43:13.632 --> 00:43:14.800
Talking to a woman

00:43:15.008 --> 00:43:17.844
and thereby establishing
some kind of way

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.888
to win her trust,
so she'll help us.

00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:20.972
Understand?

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:23.934
But, wait. No, no, no.
No, no, no.

00:43:24.017 --> 00:43:25.977
But what--what if my wife
finds out about it?

00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:27.771
Hey, now, don't you
worry about it.

00:43:27.854 --> 00:43:29.231
I mean, who's going
to tell her?

00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:30.857
I suppose.

00:43:31.149 --> 00:43:33.902
But should I pretend
that I'm in love?

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:35.654
It's up to you.

00:43:35.737 --> 00:43:37.364
I just want you
to get close to her.

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:39.199
And have sex with her?

00:43:39.407 --> 00:43:40.534
No sex.

00:43:41.076 --> 00:43:42.577
You get my box.

00:43:42.828 --> 00:43:44.246
You're going
to the Mandarin Palace.

00:43:44.538 --> 00:43:45.539
That's where
you'll meet her.

00:43:45.747 --> 00:43:48.333
Is this girl someone
that I've seen yet?

00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:49.668
Yes.

00:43:49.751 --> 00:43:52.254
You will recognise her
when you see her face.

00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:54.714
I hope she won't want
to get married.

00:43:55.257 --> 00:43:57.217
- That would be a disaster.
- [Yun] Mr. Chan,

00:43:57.926 --> 00:43:59.970
what about me, sir?

00:44:01.888 --> 00:44:03.306
I'll volunteer to go.

00:44:04.057 --> 00:44:05.183
Yeah.

00:44:05.725 --> 00:44:07.018
He could take my place.

00:44:07.394 --> 00:44:08.979
But you're not
a ladies' man. Ow!

00:44:10.021 --> 00:44:11.189
Listen!

00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:13.233
He failed on
the previous mission.

00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:15.777
Now it's my turn to try.

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.280
But your father worked
against the mandarin.

00:44:18.488 --> 00:44:20.157
They wouldn't let you in
without a fight.

00:44:20.615 --> 00:44:22.367
Sai Yuk isn't known
to them at all.

00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:24.327
Yes...

00:44:24.703 --> 00:44:25.954
and she really likes him.

00:44:26.037 --> 00:44:27.205
We'll see.

00:44:27.497 --> 00:44:28.999
We'll see.

00:44:29.082 --> 00:44:30.375
I just might succeed.

00:44:30.667 --> 00:44:31.751
You betting on it?

00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:33.795
Certainly. Why don't
we set a wager?

00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:35.505
What is your bet?

00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:37.465
If I lose,
I'll find a way

00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:38.758
to destroy my kung fu.

00:44:39.217 --> 00:44:40.343
All right, then.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:43.180
Don't be worried.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.725
[Soo Li] "A chance meeting
along the riverbank

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.103
and now I have
only fate to thank.

00:44:50.645 --> 00:44:53.607
I long for a word, a glance, a look.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:56.067
I remain your servant,
Fong Sai Yuk."

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:59.738
Oh, how wonderful!

00:45:01.656 --> 00:45:03.825
[laughs]

00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:22.427
[gasps]

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:23.595
Dad.

00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:32.062
A young man
wants to court me.

00:45:32.854 --> 00:45:35.148
I know that
you'll like him.

00:45:37.567 --> 00:45:39.402
So, who is
this young man?

00:45:39.861 --> 00:45:41.154
Is he a scoundrel?

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:42.697
No. He's not.

00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:46.910
Well, then, if he wants
to court you,

00:45:47.327 --> 00:45:48.495
he'll have to
prove himself.

00:45:48.578 --> 00:45:49.704
Well, that's perfect.

00:45:55.502 --> 00:45:57.712
Mum, shouldn't I tell
Ting Ting?

00:45:57.796 --> 00:45:59.130
No. There she is.

00:45:59.422 --> 00:46:00.423
Hold this.

00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.133
Wait.
I don't want it.

00:46:02.217 --> 00:46:03.134
You hold it.

00:46:03.218 --> 00:46:04.427
All right.
Listen.

00:46:04.844 --> 00:46:06.429
Yeah?
What should I do?

00:46:06.513 --> 00:46:07.764
You should just
kiss her, that's what.

00:46:07.847 --> 00:46:08.932
Don't play shy.

00:46:09.015 --> 00:46:10.308
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:12.352
Just go right over there
and give her one.

00:46:12.435 --> 00:46:13.645
- Right here?
- There she is.

00:46:13.853 --> 00:46:14.854
Okay, then.

00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:26.992
Let's get to it, hmm?

00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:32.038
You've come to me
at long last.

00:46:32.872 --> 00:46:34.916
- But we, uh--
- Are you scared?

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.001
Ma?

00:46:36.084 --> 00:46:37.544
I'll fix that.

00:46:38.253 --> 00:46:39.879
Come on.
Don't be afraid.

00:46:40.338 --> 00:46:41.589
You should've
kissed him.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:43.550
Hmmph!

00:46:45.218 --> 00:46:46.970
She wants you
all the more.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:48.513
What's the matter?

00:46:48.596 --> 00:46:49.639
Nothing.

00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:52.559
You don't want to let
her get away now.

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.185
Better go.

00:46:56.229 --> 00:46:57.522
All right. Unh!

00:46:58.565 --> 00:46:59.566
Ooh!

00:47:05.947 --> 00:47:07.032
That was easy.

00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:08.700
Oh!

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.077
Mmm.

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.663
What are you doing?
Go after her.

00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:15.623
What?
You mean...

00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:18.126
You kissed
one of the Buddhist nuns?

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:21.338
Hey, it could be the first
kiss that she ever got.

00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:22.714
- Now come on.
- Okay.

00:47:22.922 --> 00:47:24.049
She might ask you
for more.

00:47:24.132 --> 00:47:25.592
Ahh! Ahh!

00:47:27.677 --> 00:47:29.179
I must've
scared her away.

00:47:29.262 --> 00:47:30.430
Maybe she doesn't
want me.

00:47:30.513 --> 00:47:32.432
- Oh, stop it.
- Stop what?

00:47:32.515 --> 00:47:33.516
[Soo Li] Sai Yuk,

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.185
do you want to
marry me or not?

00:47:35.268 --> 00:47:37.645
Sure, I do, but there's
one condition.

00:47:37.937 --> 00:47:39.022
Well, what is it?

00:47:39.105 --> 00:47:40.106
That box you have.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.983
All right.
I can get it somehow,

00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:43.526
but you'll also have
to prove yourself

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:44.778
in a competition
you'll win,

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:46.821
and you'll also
declare your love.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.281
- Deal.
- Bet on it.

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.105
The competition
will soon start.

00:48:21.356 --> 00:48:23.900
The winner
will marry Sho Soo Li.

00:48:24.609 --> 00:48:27.153
The rules are simple,
so now listen.

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:29.948
Whichever man
retrieves the flowered ball

00:48:30.031 --> 00:48:31.699
from the top
of the bridal sedan,

00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:33.618
I shall proclaim
the winner,

00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:35.745
and then he will also wed
my daughter.

00:48:36.871 --> 00:48:39.374
The true competition
will now begin.

00:48:39.749 --> 00:48:41.251
[Playing fanfare]

00:48:43.545 --> 00:48:45.255
[Crowd] Ohh.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.091
Ooh, what
arresting beauty.

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:51.469
[Soo Li] Where is he?

00:48:54.639 --> 00:48:56.349
She'll make
a fine bride.

00:48:57.225 --> 00:48:58.184
Too bad.

00:48:58.518 --> 00:48:59.894
Too bad
she'll be mine.

00:49:00.228 --> 00:49:01.438
I'll win.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.690
She'll be
my wife

00:49:03.898 --> 00:49:05.150
once I'm
finished.

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:08.236
Sorry, my friends,

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:10.071
I'm going to win.

00:49:10.321 --> 00:49:11.573
Contestants, get ready.

00:49:11.865 --> 00:49:13.199
[Men grunt]

00:49:13.741 --> 00:49:14.659
And start!

00:49:14.742 --> 00:49:16.202
[Yelling]

00:49:58.745 --> 00:50:00.163
Kick them!

00:50:12.258 --> 00:50:13.718
[Men Yelling]

00:50:40.078 --> 00:50:41.246
Mmm!

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.897
I told you we'd be late
carrying this flagpole.

00:51:50.231 --> 00:51:52.358
Don't worry. These guys
can't keep us out.

00:51:53.234 --> 00:51:54.193
[Both] What do you want?

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:56.321
- The girl.
- The kung fu contest.

00:51:56.404 --> 00:51:57.905
- He's too late.
- Am I?

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:02.118
Hmm.

00:52:02.994 --> 00:52:03.911
Ohh! Aah!

00:52:03.995 --> 00:52:05.580
[Laughter]

00:52:10.501 --> 00:52:12.003
Aha! Oh!

00:52:24.682 --> 00:52:25.558
Ooh.

00:52:33.858 --> 00:52:35.026
[Man] Hey!

00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:39.656
Hello.

00:52:41.741 --> 00:52:42.825
- Huh?
- Hey, there.

00:52:46.287 --> 00:52:47.955
Aah!

00:52:48.581 --> 00:52:50.208
[Crowd] Ohh!

00:52:54.629 --> 00:52:55.630
Yeah.

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:02.303
About time
you made it.

00:53:02.387 --> 00:53:03.388
I'm sorry.

00:53:04.639 --> 00:53:05.556
Have you been waiting?

00:53:06.766 --> 00:53:08.101
So long.

00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:09.477
Bored yet?

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:12.814
Hey, don't get thrown off.

00:53:15.441 --> 00:53:17.694
Well, men,
have a nice ride down.

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:32.750
Are you ready?

00:53:32.834 --> 00:53:34.919
I was hoping you were
going to ask me that.

00:53:40.133 --> 00:53:41.134
All right.

00:53:44.846 --> 00:53:46.389
[All] Aah!

00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:53.146
Good, huh?

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:54.355
Wow.

00:53:54.605 --> 00:53:56.232
Just amazing. Huh?

00:54:01.487 --> 00:54:03.614
I know.
You want me to jump.

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:07.118
Hai!

00:54:07.702 --> 00:54:08.619
- Whoo.
- Let's go.

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:12.081
Thanks.

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:23.676
What? Huh?

00:54:24.135 --> 00:54:25.928
- Hmm?
- What's the matter?

00:54:26.471 --> 00:54:27.722
Can't you look me in the eye?

00:54:27.805 --> 00:54:29.348
Ahh. Ready?

00:54:29.557 --> 00:54:30.975
Hey, wait.

00:54:31.225 --> 00:54:32.310
I'm shocked.

00:54:32.393 --> 00:54:33.311
Wait a minute.

00:54:33.394 --> 00:54:34.812
Come on.
Let me explain.

00:54:34.896 --> 00:54:36.189
Have you gone crazy?

00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:38.608
Didn't you think
I'd find out about this?

00:54:38.691 --> 00:54:41.110
- Well, yes, but there's more to this...
- I don't want to hear it.

00:54:41.194 --> 00:54:42.320
...than there seems
to be right now.

00:54:42.403 --> 00:54:43.654
- I'm not going to listen.
- If you'd listen--

00:54:43.738 --> 00:54:44.739
I'm not!

00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:47.033
That might've hurt.

00:54:47.241 --> 00:54:48.367
How about this?

00:54:49.911 --> 00:54:51.078
[Crowd] Oh!

00:54:53.372 --> 00:54:54.499
Come on, settle down.

00:54:54.582 --> 00:54:55.500
I'm not done.

00:54:56.417 --> 00:54:57.627
Be sensible.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:58.669
I will not.

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:01.881
Why is she bothering us?

00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:04.425
Uh--

00:55:04.509 --> 00:55:07.929
I'll tell you why.
I'm his wife.

00:55:08.888 --> 00:55:09.889
Don't believe it.

00:55:10.556 --> 00:55:12.391
Oh, two can play at that.

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:13.810
All right.

00:55:14.393 --> 00:55:15.603
Wait!

00:55:27.949 --> 00:55:28.908
Creep!

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:37.708
There must be
a better way.

00:55:37.959 --> 00:55:40.795
[Straining]

00:55:47.301 --> 00:55:48.469
Let me at them.

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:56.978
[Ting Ting] Ohh!

00:55:58.896 --> 00:56:00.064
Ma.

00:56:01.899 --> 00:56:02.900
You asked for it.

00:56:03.442 --> 00:56:04.861
Will you help me
break this up?

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:06.571
- Who should I take?
- That one.

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.156
- Li, come on.
- Ting Ting.

00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:11.075
- Please, stop fighting.
- Come on now.

00:56:12.285 --> 00:56:14.662
Listen, he's doing--
he doesn't love her.

00:56:14.745 --> 00:56:15.955
Well, I don't care.

00:56:16.038 --> 00:56:17.665
Someone should've mentioned
something to me.

00:56:17.748 --> 00:56:19.458
Hey, you wouldn't have
wanted him to do it.

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:20.543
- Come on now, Li.
- Let me go.

00:56:20.626 --> 00:56:22.920
Let me go. I'll make you
into a slave.

00:56:23.129 --> 00:56:24.380
Let me see you
try it.

00:56:24.755 --> 00:56:26.424
Come on now.
Please, please.

00:56:26.507 --> 00:56:28.175
Let me go!
Let me go!

00:56:28.259 --> 00:56:29.302
Hey, take it easy.

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:31.429
The minute he realises
what kind of woman you are,

00:56:31.512 --> 00:56:33.180
he'll drop her
like an old habit.

00:56:33.264 --> 00:56:34.765
- Whoa now!
- Why?

00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:36.267
Well, it was
for Mr. Chan.

00:56:37.018 --> 00:56:38.519
All right. If you don't
care about her,

00:56:38.811 --> 00:56:40.479
- then go slap her.
- I will.

00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:41.898
Stop.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:44.066
You want that box?

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:46.319
Huh?

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:47.361
All right.
then I'll do it.

00:56:47.445 --> 00:56:48.362
Wait.
Don't do it.

00:56:48.446 --> 00:56:49.322
[gasps]

00:56:50.239 --> 00:56:52.033
You keep your hands
away from Sai Yuk.

00:56:53.284 --> 00:56:54.952
He loves me,
not you.

00:56:55.202 --> 00:56:56.954
Just ask him
if you don't believe me.

00:56:57.204 --> 00:56:58.706
Unless you're afraid to.

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:00.666
Hmm?

00:57:03.252 --> 00:57:04.378
Why won't you
look at me?

00:57:04.712 --> 00:57:07.632
- But--
- So, I'll jump, then.

00:57:08.466 --> 00:57:09.800
[Gasps]
Come back!

00:57:23.481 --> 00:57:25.566
[Crowd Yelling]

00:57:26.025 --> 00:57:27.568
Stop it. Why won't you
let me fall?

00:57:27.652 --> 00:57:29.779
[Strains] I won't.
You're my wife.

00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:31.697
I'm supposed to be
your only wife.

00:57:32.323 --> 00:57:34.492
Sai Yuk, save me!

00:57:35.368 --> 00:57:36.285
What?

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:42.625
[Soo Li] So strong.

00:57:42.708 --> 00:57:44.168
Just like you are
in bed.

00:57:44.251 --> 00:57:45.419
Hmm. Ha ha!

00:57:45.753 --> 00:57:47.171
You took her to bed?

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:49.715
All right. Let me loose,
and I'll fall, okay?

00:57:50.216 --> 00:57:51.467
What are you doing?

00:57:51.842 --> 00:57:53.052
She's making it up.

00:57:53.511 --> 00:57:54.637
Let me go!

00:57:54.887 --> 00:57:57.515
Son, ready to catch
an old lady, huh?

00:57:57.765 --> 00:57:59.558
Aah!

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:02.311
Wait!
Both hands are full!

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:05.564
Someone else
catch me! Ohh!

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:06.816
Lei Ling!

00:58:11.696 --> 00:58:14.824
[Crowd] Ohh.

00:58:15.908 --> 00:58:18.160
Oh, boy. Uhh!

00:58:18.244 --> 00:58:19.495
You better start running.

00:58:19.578 --> 00:58:21.956
[Crowd Yelling]

00:58:22.289 --> 00:58:23.582
[Mother] Ohh.

00:58:25.209 --> 00:58:27.378
Listen to me.
Try to understand.

00:58:27.586 --> 00:58:29.171
Sai Yuk didn't want
to do it.

00:58:30.047 --> 00:58:31.132
Will you forgive us?

00:58:31.716 --> 00:58:32.883
Liars.

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:35.511
[Mother] I know
it wasn't fair to you.

00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:38.723
Please, please
forgive him. Please.

00:58:40.891 --> 00:58:42.018
[Sighs]

00:58:43.936 --> 00:58:45.062
Fong, I hope...

00:58:46.063 --> 00:58:47.606
you two will have a

00:58:48.357 --> 00:58:49.942
long and happy life
together

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:51.193
as husband and wife.

00:58:53.154 --> 00:58:54.155
Hey!

00:58:56.115 --> 00:58:57.241
Lei Ling.

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:58.367
It's time for me
to go.

00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:00.202
You understand,
don't you, dear?

00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:03.539
All rise and greet
my new son-in-law.

00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:06.208
My love.

00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:08.169
Hmm.
I want more.

00:59:09.795 --> 00:59:11.464
All right!

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:14.175
I love you,
Sho Soo Li!

00:59:34.862 --> 00:59:36.155
The outside world

00:59:36.989 --> 00:59:38.949
seems still and distant

00:59:39.033 --> 00:59:40.367
to the wedded couple.

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.828
Happiness holds them

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:44.914
in its tender embrace

00:59:45.372 --> 00:59:47.166
and finds only...

00:59:48.042 --> 00:59:50.586
sweetness and laughter
as companions.

00:59:50.669 --> 00:59:51.796
Ahh.

00:59:52.797 --> 00:59:54.465
As they embark

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:57.009
on their new life
together...

00:59:57.426 --> 00:59:58.844
Whoops. Huh?

01:00:00.012 --> 01:00:01.305
Nothing.

01:00:01.388 --> 01:00:02.431
Nothing can--

01:00:02.681 --> 01:00:05.434
Lei Ling, I don't want
to hear that right now.

01:00:06.227 --> 01:00:07.478
Shall I sing a song
instead?

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.480
I keep remembering

01:00:10.439 --> 01:00:13.484
Sai Yuk reciting
those words to me.

01:00:16.612 --> 01:00:18.364
What do you say?
Shall we?

01:00:19.073 --> 01:00:20.241
What's your hurry?

01:00:21.408 --> 01:00:23.035
I'll keep my end
of the bargain

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.411
as long as you keep yours.

01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:27.039
[Soo Li] What do you
really want?

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.708
Me or what's in
your old box?

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.961
What?
You know I want the box.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:34.505
[Soo Li]
Take it, then.

01:00:36.173 --> 01:00:37.299
[Scoffs]

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:56.569
It's me.

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:57.903
Are you finished?
Hmm?

01:01:00.489 --> 01:01:01.574
This way.

01:01:18.632 --> 01:01:20.634
[Mandarin]
Halt! Stop them!

01:01:26.056 --> 01:01:28.350
You all seem
to be in a rush.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:32.021
Where do you think
you're going?

01:01:32.354 --> 01:01:33.355
- To church.
- To eat.

01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:35.357
Is that so?

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:37.067
You used deception on us.

01:01:38.068 --> 01:01:39.904
You've fooled us
to get what you wanted.

01:01:40.529 --> 01:01:41.488
Now...

01:01:41.906 --> 01:01:43.490
I'll take back the box

01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:45.159
that my daughter says

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:46.869
you stole from her.

01:01:47.411 --> 01:01:49.622
Is that what she said?
Now, how can that be?

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:51.081
Why don't you
ask her again?

01:01:51.165 --> 01:01:52.875
Enough of your fooling.

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:54.501
Charge them!

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:57.338
Hey, don't come near us.

01:01:57.421 --> 01:01:58.547
Or I'll kill
the mandarin.

01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:03.552
[gasps]

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.014
Where did that thing
come from, huh?

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:08.474
It's done now.

01:02:08.807 --> 01:02:10.309
You will give me
the box.

01:02:11.143 --> 01:02:12.228
Light it.

01:02:16.482 --> 01:02:17.858
- Hey, Ma?
- Maybe he's bluffing.

01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:19.318
- What's that?
- Is he wrong?

01:02:20.027 --> 01:02:21.237
[Mother] Then we better
start running.

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:22.780
Okay, let's go.

01:02:23.864 --> 01:02:24.698
Mum? Where is she?

01:02:24.782 --> 01:02:25.991
Couldn't leave
without you.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.284
[Soo Li] Stop.

01:02:28.661 --> 01:02:30.704
Dad, if he dies,
then I die.

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.331
You mean you'd take
your own life?

01:02:32.623 --> 01:02:35.042
I owe it to him.

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:36.919
He's my husband.

01:02:37.169 --> 01:02:38.170
You slept with her?

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:39.505
- What more?
- Save it for some other time.

01:02:39.588 --> 01:02:40.965
We're about to be shot.

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:44.718
Well, you decide.

01:02:44.802 --> 01:02:45.719
You can't!

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:48.305
Sir, you will stop it now.

01:02:49.556 --> 01:02:50.683
Mmm!

01:02:51.183 --> 01:02:52.226
Mmm!

01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:53.519
Ohh.

01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:56.272
Go away...

01:02:56.605 --> 01:02:57.982
and do not return.

01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:01.151
I'll lead. Now.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.154
Come on, hurry.

01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:17.293
Thank you.

[Men Shouting]

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:40.959
All right.
Ting Ting, you take the box.

01:04:45.506 --> 01:04:46.840
Hyah! Hyah!

01:04:52.554 --> 01:04:53.972
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.433
Mum, I want you
to protect the box.

01:04:56.683 --> 01:04:57.643
I will.

01:04:57.893 --> 01:05:00.604
You know you can
count on me, son.

01:05:00.979 --> 01:05:02.439
After the woman!
Hyah!

01:05:09.696 --> 01:05:10.906

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:12.741
Don't get yourself caught.

01:05:13.033 --> 01:05:14.243
I know.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.161
Look out, Sai Yuk!

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:19.540
Go, Sai Yuk, go!

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:21.917

01:05:27.673 --> 01:05:29.591
Ah, I knew it.

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:30.926
- There he is.
- Sure is.

01:05:31.218 --> 01:05:33.637
That's right. I return
to you with the box.

01:05:33.887 --> 01:05:35.389
It took longer
than I thought,

01:05:35.764 --> 01:05:36.723
but I brought it.

01:05:37.808 --> 01:05:39.059
You have succeeded.

01:05:40.894 --> 01:05:41.895
What?

01:05:42.479 --> 01:05:43.772
Huhh!

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:45.274
You want it?
Come and get it.

01:05:45.357 --> 01:05:46.525
Or would you
rather see it burned?

01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:49.403
Ah, you want me
to destroy it,

01:05:49.695 --> 01:05:51.321
so no one
can learn the truth.

01:05:52.072 --> 01:05:54.032
I must've been blind

01:05:54.241 --> 01:05:56.577
not to see
such an ambitious man,

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:59.288
intent on overthrowing

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.040
our Red Flower Society.

01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:03.542
That's what
you're doing.

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:05.043
Watch yourself.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:06.962
Yun's dangerous.

01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:09.298
So, you tricked me,

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:11.508
but I'm onto you.

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:14.178
I don't think
you have the box at all.

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:16.138
It's just a model,

01:06:16.763 --> 01:06:18.140
a substitute, right?

01:06:18.515 --> 01:06:20.017
You're right.
It's a model,

01:06:20.684 --> 01:06:21.935
but the real box
is safe,

01:06:22.394 --> 01:06:23.604
and it will
arrive soon.

01:06:23.854 --> 01:06:24.897
Sai Yuk...

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:27.357
you mean...
that you don't have it?

01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:28.859
No.
Do you know why?

01:06:29.234 --> 01:06:31.653
Because they tried
to steal it from me.

01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:32.654
Enough!

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:34.323
You said you
would bring it.

01:06:34.406 --> 01:06:37.326
This means you will have
to disable yourself.

01:06:37.409 --> 01:06:38.744
Sai Yuk,
you don't belong!

01:06:38.827 --> 01:06:40.454

You lost the wager.

01:06:45.083 --> 01:06:46.251
Do you have it?

01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:48.795
That's impossible.

01:06:52.382 --> 01:06:54.843
Are you going to...

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.470
Did you bring it?

01:06:57.137 --> 01:06:58.180
I'll have it.

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.140
It's safe...

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:04.394
though I haven't brought
the box here.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.698
Go on, do it.

01:07:21.453 --> 01:07:23.163
You force me!
Hunh!

01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:34.091
Heh.

01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:35.968
He's defenceless now,

01:07:36.885 --> 01:07:38.762
but if someone should
try to hurt him,

01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:40.973
I'll come after you.

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:43.225

01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:52.234
What did he do to you?

01:07:52.484 --> 01:07:53.652
Oh, no!

01:07:55.779 --> 01:07:57.906
- Let me at him.
- Wait! Stop and listen to me, will you?

01:07:58.156 --> 01:08:00.701
Would you listen to me?
All his nerve endings are intact.

01:08:00.784 --> 01:08:02.202
We can bring
his skill back.

01:08:02.452 --> 01:08:03.787
- Do you mean it?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:13.714
make sure he gets it.

01:08:13.964 --> 01:08:15.507
Ah, so the box
showed up...

01:08:17.634 --> 01:08:20.178
and Mr. Chan is really
the emperor.

01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:21.263
Emperor?

01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:23.223
But that means trouble.

01:08:23.307 --> 01:08:24.891
I'll destroy it
as soon as possible.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:25.934
- Hey.
- What?

01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:27.936
Don't you dare destroy it.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.187
This will come in handy.

open up. It's me.

are on the way.

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:36.945
That's it.

01:08:37.362 --> 01:08:38.530
- Faster.
- All right. Now hurry.

01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:40.449
- Let's get out of here.
- We have to be faster.

Better get moving now. Go!

about it.

Not too bad, eh?

01:09:45.806 --> 01:09:47.057

you take him?

I'm going back.

have been rusty.

ohh, I should have
stayed out of it.

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:26.990
But you were so brave.

01:11:27.657 --> 01:11:28.700
You saved me.

01:11:30.535 --> 01:11:34.915

the first time

in a while.

01:11:43.715 --> 01:11:44.925
Keep my

Please.

01:11:58.730 --> 01:11:59.981
I promise.

01:12:03.109 --> 01:12:04.694
I won't forget.

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:21.169
[Footsteps]

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:27.801
[Yun] I believe...

01:12:30.595 --> 01:12:33.390
this is what
you've been looking for.

01:12:34.891 --> 01:12:38.728
It tells me
a great deal about you...

01:12:39.479 --> 01:12:41.022
the would-be emperor.

01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:43.984
You are powerless
without your followers.

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.486
We have laid waste to them.

01:12:47.487 --> 01:12:48.864
As I will to you!

01:12:52.993 --> 01:12:54.077
Not yet.

01:12:54.786 --> 01:12:57.956
Your fight with me is liable
to be your final fight.

01:12:58.039 --> 01:13:01.585
Well, do you suppose
I'd come without my men?

01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:04.087
Go ahead.

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.382
See what happens
to your men.

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:09.467
- No. I can't.
- [Men] Kill him!

01:13:09.759 --> 01:13:11.928
Go ahead! What are you trying
to prove to us?

01:13:12.178 --> 01:13:14.014
Once again,
the leader is now Yun.

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:16.016
You begin following me!

01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:18.184
You have given me
no option.

01:13:18.852 --> 01:13:20.896
I will not
allow men to die.

01:13:21.479 --> 01:13:22.856
You have the advantage.

01:13:23.273 --> 01:13:25.734
I will not permit
any more suffering.

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:29.738
So, now, our society
is at your disposal.

01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:40.916
Brethren, once again
the Yun family rules.

01:13:41.374 --> 01:13:44.210
It was all worthwhile.
Ha ha ha!

All hail
the master!

[All] Hail Master Yun!

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:53.011
Mr. Yun, sir,
what about the woman?

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:55.138
- Huh?
- There!

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:01.311
Ha ha ha!

01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:04.522
Ah, yes,
you always reminded me

01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:06.274
of a mother hen.

01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:10.362
Except that you look after
a flock of only one.

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:12.948
Let's see now,
I have something for you,

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:15.784
mother hen! Ha ha ha!

01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:27.587
[Man] Get her!
Ha ha! Get her!

01:14:27.837 --> 01:14:30.590
You're nothing but
a meddling old woman!

01:14:32.425 --> 01:14:33.760
Ha ha ha!

01:14:43.019 --> 01:14:47.273
[Men Laughing]

01:14:49.734 --> 01:14:52.821
We'll see how many days

01:14:53.154 --> 01:14:56.408
you survive. Ha ha ha!

01:15:23.977 --> 01:15:25.270
[gasps]

01:15:25.353 --> 01:15:26.438
Mum!

01:15:33.778 --> 01:15:35.196
Here you are,
Sai Yuk.

01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:37.866
Have you heard
from my mother?

01:15:41.995 --> 01:15:45.623
But it's been a month.
That can't be.

01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:48.418
Who's there?

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:51.546
I've come about
your godfather.

01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:53.214
They're holding him
prisoner.

01:15:53.506 --> 01:15:55.050
- And my mother?
- It's bad.

01:15:55.967 --> 01:15:57.761
She's barely surviving.

01:15:58.636 --> 01:16:00.138
They've hung her
in the square.

01:16:01.681 --> 01:16:03.308
Ma! Unh!

01:16:03.391 --> 01:16:05.310
Sai Yuk, you must rest.

01:16:05.518 --> 01:16:07.353
You can rely on the
others to help her now.

01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:10.315
No. The others
are mostly dead.

01:16:11.274 --> 01:16:12.942
Those that have survived

01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:15.987
are being held prisoner
with Mr. Chan.

01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:19.908
Our army does not
exist anymore.

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:22.535
There is no one left
to fight them, Mr. Fong.

01:16:22.869 --> 01:16:23.828
No one but you.

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:25.246
[Horse Neighs]

01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:39.385
Your son is a coward!

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:40.970
He'll never show!

01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:45.809
Unh!

[Man]
Look, there he is!

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:43.283
My mother,
where do you have her?

01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:50.665
I will destroy anyone

01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:53.084
who tries to stop me.

01:17:54.502 --> 01:17:55.503
I will fight!

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:02.552
With the guidance
of the heavens.

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.370
He can't possibly see us!
Kill him!

01:18:40.089 --> 01:18:41.257
Aah!

01:18:52.435 --> 01:18:53.770
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:18:54.646 --> 01:18:56.189
You must all beware.

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.965
My movements
are guided by heaven.

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:25.426

-Aah!

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:26.761
Yaah!

01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:51.911
Yaah!

01:19:58.584 --> 01:20:00.503
Aggh!

01:20:25.028 --> 01:20:26.738
Come on, let's
get out of here!

01:20:41.502 --> 01:20:42.754
[gasps]

01:20:45.631 --> 01:20:47.425
Ha ha ha!

01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:50.303
Free my mother.

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:52.180
It's me that you want.

01:20:52.722 --> 01:20:54.974
[Yun] Yes, it is you
that I want.

01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:56.434
I want to see you die!

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:59.854
But first I want
to watch you suffer.

01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:02.315
Let her go then.

01:21:02.648 --> 01:21:06.319
You can see that
I won't run from you.

01:21:06.402 --> 01:21:09.030
That would make things too easy,
wouldn't it now?

01:21:09.989 --> 01:21:11.699
All right, then. Unh!

01:21:26.714 --> 01:21:27.757

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.261
Oh, no!

01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:27.817
I can't wait to watch
your mother die...

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:30.111
and you with her!

01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:40.496

01:23:52.235 --> 01:23:53.861
[Yun] I think
she's slipping.

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:55.613
Oh, no!

01:23:56.239 --> 01:23:57.949

01:23:58.032 --> 01:23:59.075
Stay where you are!

01:23:59.283 --> 01:24:01.619
The society
has a poor leader!

01:24:01.702 --> 01:24:04.789
So? Better get
used to it. Now!

01:24:05.456 --> 01:24:07.792
Yaah! Ha ha ha!

01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:10.503
Not another step!

01:24:11.337 --> 01:24:12.463
Because I'll do it.

01:24:13.256 --> 01:24:14.882
Sissy boy.

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:21.389
What's wrong?

01:24:21.472 --> 01:24:23.849
Can't find a way
to save your own mother?

01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:43.202
Come on!

01:24:47.039 --> 01:24:49.292
Fong Sai Yuk,
still weak, aren't you?

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:50.835
Ha ha ha!

01:24:51.711 --> 01:24:54.505
Show me what's left of
your kung fu skills!

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:55.923
Ha ha ha!

01:24:56.507 --> 01:24:59.176
Come on. You can get up
and show him.

01:25:41.594 --> 01:25:43.346
- We'll beat him together.
- All right.

01:25:43.429 --> 01:25:44.388
I'll kill you both!

01:25:58.944 --> 01:26:00.446
- Do it now!
- Let's do it!

01:26:09.789 --> 01:26:10.956
He'll wear himself out.

01:26:15.211 --> 01:26:16.712
Aagh!

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:18.589
Come on!

01:26:19.006 --> 01:26:20.091
Which one is
the fatal nerve?

01:26:20.424 --> 01:26:21.801
On the spine!

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.220
Aah!

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.848
It's called the stone dragon,
and it works like this.

01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:35.606
That's it! Good!

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:36.941
I guess I remembered!

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:00.381
Hyah!

01:27:10.933 --> 01:27:12.309

Oh, well,
that wasn't so bad, was it?

01:27:24.238 --> 01:27:26.323
[Both] Well, at least
you could thank us now.

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:27.533
Thanks.

01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:29.118
What are you doing here?

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:31.579
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

01:27:31.662 --> 01:27:33.289
He shouldn't be sitting
up there like that.

01:27:33.372 --> 01:27:35.374
Oh, he won't be
bothering anybody.

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:38.043
Well, thanks to us, right?
Let's go.

It's our side.

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.472
Sai Yuk, why don't you
return with us?

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.099
I can't. I've got to be
going my own way.

01:28:34.934 --> 01:28:36.852
Too bad. The society
will miss you.

01:28:37.061 --> 01:28:38.312
[Mother]
Don't worry, Mr. Chan.

01:28:38.395 --> 01:28:40.731
If you need his assistance
for anything,

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:41.732
you'll have it.

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:43.067
Thank you so much.

01:28:43.442 --> 01:28:46.487
It looks like you'll have
your hands full as it is.

01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:47.738
You said it.

01:28:48.197 --> 01:28:49.865
I want to give you
something nice.

01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:51.700
But I really want for you
to have my gift now.

01:28:52.117 --> 01:28:54.537
- Now!
- But listen, Sai Yuk's grandfather

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:56.455
gave it to him when
he was just a boy.

01:28:56.539 --> 01:28:58.874
He told me the same thing
about this very one.

01:29:00.376 --> 01:29:02.002
How could the both
of us have--

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.130
I have so many
of these things.

01:29:06.423 --> 01:29:08.425
I'd like you to take one.

01:29:08.968 --> 01:29:10.052
Aah!

- You're very kind.
- Okay. How about you?

Would you like one?
I've got about a million of 'em.

01:29:16.267 --> 01:29:17.977

talk more often.

did you give them to?!

the same present!
